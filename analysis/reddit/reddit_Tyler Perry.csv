The board of trustees directly vetoed Urban last season due to his checkered past and overall poor reputation. I doubt that changes in just 1 years time.

Most likely problem is Helton's buyout is reportedly in the neighborhood of $20 **MILLION**. 

So they're at a point where they either get a sure-fire, can't-miss guy like Urban or they might as well just keep Helton till his buyout goes down."
154,2020-02-05 19:07:58,ez9gj9,He apparently put a post on instagram and then deleted it that supposedly alluded to reinstatement.  I think if he stays out of trouble then it's basically a formality at this point.

202,2020-02-06 02:17:37,ez9gj9,"In truth, people use the 247 composite which is ESPN, 247, and Rivals ""averaged"" into one.

Rivals tends to favor guys that come to their camps and across the southeast. That's why so many SEC teams are in the top 10 on Rivals.

247 tends to favor guys that come to their camps and the All-star games

ESPN seems to get the top 300 mostly right and then never re-evaluates (or maybe once, twice a year) through signing day.

All of them tend to bump recruits up based on their offer lists, but there's a lot of gray area there as some schools don't actually give a committable offer, some schools will only recruit based on scheme, and it's a chicken/egg scenario with talent evaluation."

Actual quote from Zach Evans.

He said he was going to commit on 3 or 4 different dates then didn't.

He's had 7 or 8 different leaders in his recruitment including LSU, Texas, Texas A&M, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Tenn, Ole Miss. He said he wanted to official to USC (California) who was unaware, and Ohio State who wasn't recruiting him.

He was suspended for 3 different games this year as a senior in HS. The first 2 for a physical altercation with a coach and the last one for initially refusing to give up his phone like every one else on the team for curfew the day before the state championship.

He's constantly on IG live spreading false information. He said he wouldn't visit UT then he did.

He said he was going to Athens last weekend then didn't.

He officially visited LSU and Texas A&M then signed with UGA. UGA had no idea and wasn't ready to accept him into the class. Rumor was he took his ACT and didn't qualify to EE at UGA, so he asked for a release from his LOI.

He's said that he was going to take his last official visit in March and take his time, now there's a rumor he's committing tomorrow because he said so on IG live.

Pruitt was supposed to meet him in home like 3 different times, but decided to hold off because he said he was going to continue his recruitment in March."

Back in the ‘90s you had Charlie Ward, Ron Curry (nation’s #1 recruit in both), Allen Iverson, and Tony Gonzalez all playing basketball and football successfully at the D1 level.  Usually a guy may try both, ride the pine in basketball for a year or two, then concentrate on football when it’s clear that’s where his meal ticket is."

227,2020-02-05 16:36:23,ez9gj9,"I understand that but my point is for example if he was playing basketball this time of year, he would be missing the workouts the football team does this time of year because he'd be busy playing basketball. Then in the spring when the basketball teams conditioning program is going he would be busy with spring football. It's just hard to do both and make gains physically so in an ideal world he wouldn't but he may do it anyway. I just doubt that will happen personally."

It's a family comedy so I could watch it with my grandparents or myself and still laugh at some of the stupid moments. It might not be edgy or clever but there's plenty of funny moments and I enjoy the actors that they got together for this movie.

Old Dogs-

This one is even stupider but also kind of a family comedy with Robin Williams and John Travolta. I still think of some of the scenes in this movie and crack up. 

Like the scene when Robin and John are listing side effects of their many medications and one of them is ""sudden loss of depth perception"", which proves to be a real side effect later in the film. 

Also When Robin Williams finds out he has two kids and they come running out yelling ""Daddy!"", the sinking look on his face kills me.

 I completely see why it is universally loathed  as much as it is.

That's the first film of his released since *Goldmember*  in 2002 and the comedy landscape had changed drastically at that point because of Apatow's & Rogen/Goldberg's influence on the whole genre.

The script, mostly pertaining to the jokes/gags, is incredibly out of date. 

It comes off as more juvenile and lowbrow  than *International Man of Mystery*, and not like a movie that is 11 years older and a vastly inferior follow up to the hilarious and iconic *Austin Powers Trilogy*

Only thing I found remotely funny was the scene in Verne Troyer's character's scaled down office.

If you’re a writer, you would know that writers, even mediocre ones, would know how to incorporate diversity without resorting to tokenization.

Choosing what characters to include is literally half of a writer’s job. Unless you are specifically looking to tell a story about a specific group (which Tyler Perry does; there’s your asinine comparison debunked), neglecting to include large populations is nothing less than laziness."

I'm not saying you should be sure you have a 'Pokemon cast' because you gotta catch 'em all, I'm saying that if you see a lot of one race around you, it might be a good idea to ask why that is and consider breaking it up a bit unless the reason is, ""because it makes the most sense for this story""."

I can agree with you on that. Although, it should only be ""broken up a bit"" if it's by choice."

Nope. It’s toxic to think that POC is what matters, when it isn’t. Like I said before, in the 90s White Americans made-up 65% of NYC’s population, and then, even to this day that number counts 50%. So, it’s not weird to have 6 friends who happen to be all white. Then, the reason the 6 actors for Friends were chosen was because of the fact that they were the most talented out of 100s of actors who went on audition (looking at their chemistry as an example) and they were the best for the respective roles.

But it's pretty clear you don't actually mean it. Since you are against the diverse casting. When you say ""Someone doesn't have to look like you for you to relate to them!""

Fact and reality is, you should obsess more about the content of your own character, than relying on your race, skin, or religion as an excuse to appear in a show. Friends is a prime example. These actors, like Matthew Perry, were best for their roles.

>And you can prove that zero biases went into that, either explicit racial or implicit biases toward one's own culture?

Because, let's be real and honest, nobody would have made as many solid and golden jokes for the character of Chandler Bing as Matthew Perry did. Proving once more than quality and the content of someone's character go hand in hand.

>merican and European made media have White protagonists same as Korean media. Diverse media hands down outsell none diverse media.

You know except for when we take a south Korean show and make it into a show about a white person. Which we did with The Good Doctor.

Also, American media and European media are way different than South Korean media and Japanese media seeing how America/Europe makes a lot of their shows for a global audience. South Korea didn't make Coffee Prince with the idea that Americans would watch it.

>Black make 13% of the population, Hispanics make up 17% percent, Asians 5.6%, LGBT 4.5%. Set a show in South Korea

If it's about realism then you would also have such passion over how cop/detective shows are just completely wrong about the justice system. You don't though.  You only care about realism when it comes to race.

No. This is not a thing. These experiences are not comparable.

This is commonly known as a ""causal fallacy"". Matthew Perry was a nobody at the time of production. What if the production team actually preferred another actor for the role but they had a scheduling conflict or dropped out based on salary negotiations? Assuming that they got the job because they were the best is absolutely *naive*.

> Proving once more than quality and the content of someone's character go hand in hand.

He's already admitted that he was so drugged out that he doesn't even remember filming the last few seasons of Friends. Apparently character didn't add too much to the quality of the product.

Sorry to surprise you, but there is no flaw in my own argument. I'm saying that fictitious tv shows, like Friends, follow the **content** of someone's character, not on anti-American propaganda like you. E.g. including Blacks, Mestizo's or Koreans because it suits their skin color and further aiding its purpose of focusing on aspects that don't matter in America society today.

Your case is inherently flawed as a consequence, because it doesn't take the content of someone's own individual character into the equation of quality.

Friends did **not** become a smash rating hit tv-show with 50 million viewers tuning in to watch the SuperBowl episode in 1996 for example, because all the characters happen to be white. They were watching and came to enjoy the episode, because the comedy was great and the actors performing as their respective characters were great. This includes Matthew Perry's, and thereby with extension, Chandler's comedic talent, like ""*Could we BE anymore white trash?!*""

Last but not least, nobody had any issue with Julie being a Chinese American and happen to be Ross' girlfriend in the beginning of season 2. It's just that due to the talent of Aniston and Schwimmer, including their overwhelming chemistry, that millions wanted to see them together.

This is no casual fallacy. Don't throw around words if you don't even know what it means and doesn't even apply to this situation. Matthew Perry got the role of Chandler Bing, because he was the best during the auditions, in addition to the great comedic talent he possesses and we came to see being further proof of that. Besides, here is a whole article about it: [HE WAS QUITE LITERALLY BORN TO BE CHANDLER](https://www.comedycentral.co.uk/news/matthew-perry-stole-the-role-of-chandler-from-his-actor-friends-and-were-shocked-too) 

Not to forget during auditiniong you also have a thing called ""**group testing**"". This is where producers, among an experimenting audience as well, test the chemistry between the actors to see whether they fit to be a part of the show.

> He's already admitted that he was so drugged out that he doesn't even remember filming 

That was during season 5 and 6 dude. In the other ones he was sober, with the exception of season 3, due to a Vicodin addiction which you clearly saw with his massive weight loss. Then, being a great actor and dealing with the stress of of being famous and in Hollywood are two completely different things.

Nope, it's anti-American propaganda to claim that Friends should have had a main character in the show who is not white. It's the main Friends debacle we have observed in recent years, after the show was brought back to the front stage in part of its mass exposure on Netflix and reviving popularity, including foreign countries like India and Brazil.

As Americans we claim since the Civil Rights Act in 1964 that all men (including women) are created equal and that people should be **judged** on the content of their character and **not** their skin-color, or country of origin. You just failed History class there.

>People choose to have an all white cast. Which is what this debate is actually about.

Nope, it's about the title of the OP, who **wonders** why Friends get its complaints about its non-existing lack of diversity.

Then, focusing on your comment, it extrapolates to today's society and what's wrong with it. Just like in the 90s, people today should be chosen for their roles on the basis of their talents and the content of their characters. Then, using Friends as an example. All 6 actors, Jennifer, David, Matt, Matthew, Courteney and Lisa had great talent in both comedic and dramatic acting. Not to forget being simultaneously **not** driven by Egos and being down to Earth. These combinations are hard to find in Hollywood.

Only Jim Carey, Eddie Murphy, Will Smith, Steve Carell, Roseanne Barr, Anna Faris are some of the actors coming to mind who are naturally and genuinely funny, and can also be great in dramatic acting simultaneously."

I agree they should go after actor who fit the roles. The problem is that writers only characters with white people only. Look at the recent Hawaii Five-O. There is no reason the main character had to be white. His character would of fit better if he want white, but boomers like you force the whiteness of this character because it's all you like."

Nope. Again, David Schwimmer came to admit his words and what he said was taken out of context in his written statement, per usual for fake news looking for clickbait and highlighting the current toxic climate in the news and media in the US. 

Then, there is a difference between ""mental conditioning"" a.k.a. David Schwimmer wanting to come over as a Social Justice Warrior, due to the current toxic climate on television, ongoing debates about Friends and as a consequence feeling the pressure, and then, the owners of the studios and the channels forcing/coercing Friends to comply with the anti-American trend of ""Identity Politics"" to push them on the national media landscape. 

Last one for fun: 

>You should re-read these post. Your the only one here who is judging people. Your claiming that people who point out the whiteness of an old tv show is anti-American. I also saw your other post gay people 

Luckily I am not judging people. I am merely sharing facts, including the 1964 Civil Rights Act and of course the actors of Friends being chosen for their respective roles, as they were brilliant comedic and dramatic actors, which in itself are already difficult to find in Hollywood. Not to forget being as down to Earth, humble and not driven by egos like them.

And yep, Philadelphia is a great movie. Both Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington did a fantastic job, without focusing on the skin-color of either of them."

433,2020-02-04 19:28:11,eys7fw,Can I have your autograph
434,2020-02-04 21:18:42,eys7fw,Yes here you go: 😘💋
435,2020-02-04 02:38:56,eyix28,Where did this offense come...
436,2020-02-04 02:39:12,eyix28,"Yes, you read that correctly. 5, count em, 5 goals."
437,2020-02-04 02:39:03,eyix28,So happy for Johns
438,2020-02-04 02:43:04,eyix28,"gg Rangers, sorry that Benn went beast mode of Lemieux, but not that sorry."
439,2020-02-04 02:38:56,eyix28,This is what it feels like to score goals.
440,2020-02-04 02:42:10,eyix28,I wish they had let Pavs get his hatty
441,2020-02-04 02:38:58,eyix28,You enjoy seeing it.
442,2020-02-04 02:42:02,eyix28,5 goals? Hmm that’s not the Stars I know and love. GG Rangers.
443,2020-02-04 03:27:02,eyix28,Somebody showed Pavelski the post where it said he was tied with Nichuskin in goals
444,2020-02-04 02:59:09,eyix28,"The Stars look like the team they were meant to be against a decent Rangers crew. 

When the STARS post 5, few if any can stop them"
445,2020-02-04 03:04:40,eyix28,The interview with Johns was hard to watch and not shed a tear.
446,2020-02-04 03:29:34,eyix28,Felt like Ruff was coaching again.
447,2020-02-04 02:52:15,eyix28,That was a stinker for us. Was the ice insanely bad or was it just me?
448,2020-02-04 06:51:20,eyix28, Why NYR GT benched Bychnevich? He scored a goal. And didn't play in the third. GT even said that he didn't liked his game at all. Did he really played so bad? Didn't saw the game(
449,2020-02-04 03:14:22,eyix28,Gg all
450,2020-02-04 02:41:54,eyix28,Our defense is one of the worst in the league. We win games because we score goals
451,2020-02-04 02:41:13,eyix28,Lets just do this every night.
452,2020-02-04 02:46:13,eyix28,I miss offense so much
453,2020-02-04 02:42:33,eyix28,https://streamable.com/dwvtc
454,2020-02-04 02:51:04,eyix28,I'd say half beast mode
455,2020-02-04 07:52:41,eyix28,He technically was.
456,2020-02-04 04:32:43,eyix28,"Noticed it was dancing all night, got really bad in the 3rd"
457,2020-02-04 13:33:07,eyix28,"Made a number of awful passes, one or two that led to breakaways."
458,2020-02-04 13:47:40,eyix28,"Thanks. That's too bad, I like him"
459,2020-02-03 18:01:22,ey2px2,">If they had just realized that Jessie needed time in the AHL, then we would be in a very different position now. Perhaps.

-

The scuttle butt around Jesse when he signed his ELC, was that he (his agent) wanted playing assurances or else he would play in Europe again. Of course Chia and his merry men would agree to something so absurd. 

-

Great writeup again! A TL:DR for this might be: Oilers 16/17 - A healthy roster, and what would we tell Corey?"
460,2020-02-03 18:50:22,ey2px2,Someone correct me if I’m wrong but aren’t we doing better this season than we were in 2016/17 at this point after 52 games? I know we went on absolute heater at the end of that year winning the last 7/8 or something but still. That is a huge tell to me.
461,2020-02-04 09:28:05,ey2px2,"Game 7 was such a disappointment, I got more and more drunk to cope with watching it. I screamed ""fuck"" in the streets of Vancouver until an officer told me to stop or else I would get a ticket."
462,2020-02-03 19:16:06,ey2px2,[When you're rereading and you notice all the spelling and grammar mistakes you've made.](https://youtu.be/Atq_p08qHfc)
463,2020-02-04 03:52:57,ey2px2,I was at that game four of the first round. I cried a little that night.
464,2020-02-04 08:53:54,ey2px2,Yikes at that Jesse draft pick thread lmfao
465,2020-02-04 02:05:03,ey2px2,With a large pepperoni on top.
466,2020-02-03 18:38:34,ey2px2,"Didn't know about that stipulation. Still there was a clear disconnect between coaching staff and management from management keeping Puju in the roster, while TMac kept scratching him. Even if he bailed to Europe, it would have worked better for his development. Thanks for the feedback!"
467,2020-02-03 19:10:34,ey2px2,At game 52 of that season we were 28-16-8 with 64 points. Atm we are 28-18-6 with 62.
468,2020-02-03 18:40:59,ey2px2,"> Didn't know about that stipulation.

It was one of those 'widely rumored' things that seemed to come from a couple of angles back then. 

-

And yes, coach Todd didn't seem to be on board with it, and rightly so."
469,2020-02-03 19:14:28,ey2px2,Ahh. I’m sure the point requirement is looking lower this year though
470,2020-02-03 19:18:33,ey2px2,Yeah I'm not sure. I just remember being so thankful for what we had. Don't remember what other point totals were.
471,2020-02-02 02:57:02,exhpka,lmfao @ subban’s defense at the end
472,2020-02-02 02:57:35,exhpka,Thank God Subban is still in the NHL. Dallas would never score otherwise.
473,2020-02-02 02:56:50,exhpka,Subban is ass. You hate to see it.
474,2020-02-02 02:57:11,exhpka,Lmao Subban
475,2020-02-02 03:00:30,exhpka,That awkward feeling when you give up virtually nothing for Subban yet you still feel like you lost the trade.....
476,2020-02-02 02:58:09,exhpka,What the fuck was PK doing on that final play? He was in the perfect spot to cover the rebound but he skated away right after the shot... Why were you even there if you weren’t gonna play the rebound?! At least stick to your man if anything.
477,2020-02-02 02:59:15,exhpka,just here to say how good of a hockey player Nico Hischier is...
478,2020-02-02 03:01:40,exhpka,Nas has got to stop using that Hughes-Gusev-Subban line in OT.
479,2020-02-02 03:05:39,exhpka,"Sorry, Devils fans, but we needed the extra point more than you guys. Fuck the Rangers, though."
480,2020-02-02 02:57:15,exhpka,"If you can't like him at his worse, don't act like his fan at his best 😤"
481,2020-02-02 03:00:26,exhpka,does Subban always make head scratching decisions that lead to goals for the other team? or is that just whenever we play him?
482,2020-02-02 03:00:38,exhpka,"We didn’t deserve that W but I’ll take it. Don’t be too hard on Soupcan, Devils."

486,2020-02-02 03:00:41,exhpka,You love to see it
487,2020-02-02 17:21:28,exhpka,The two biggest reasons Dallas made it as far as they did last playoffs were excellent goaltending and PK Subban
488,2020-02-02 02:59:23,exhpka,He was busy posting on Instagram
489,2020-02-02 03:44:35,exhpka,How about we trade you some defense for him...
490,2020-02-02 04:14:03,exhpka,Any way we can help our extra first round pick from the Yotes gain value
491,2020-02-02 03:00:58,exhpka,Thanks I hate it
492,2020-02-02 02:59:38,exhpka,"I mean, That goal was 100% on him. He left his man open while also not playing the puck. It’s like he was actively avoiding the play at all cost."
493,2020-02-02 03:05:47,exhpka,"You guys were jerking each other off into oblivion in the offseason, you can deal with a little bit of banter"
494,2020-02-02 03:15:25,exhpka,"Doesn't change the fact that half the threads about the Devils turns into a bunch of random fans hating on him.  Why is an Arizona fan in here enjoying watching him struggle? It's tiring to see and frankly, fucking pathetic how much this sub gets off watching him fail. Maybe he's had some bad plays in the past, but he's been pretty damn clean these past few years. Yet people in this sub act like he's some Matt Cooke."
495,2020-02-02 03:19:02,exhpka,"Ah yes, we can't all be as chill as Vancouver fans who still have wet dreams of Hughes doing a mediocre Forsberg in the ASG."
496,2020-02-02 03:21:39,exhpka,What move did Jack do in the ASG?
497,2020-02-02 03:28:18,exhpka,The same one Quinn did at 18.

575,2020-02-02 00:34:22,exezxu,Jack was filthy getting into the neutral zone
576,2020-02-02 00:46:41,exezxu,I...uhhh...I don't think Nico's okay after hitting the boards like that. Been half-shifting him since and he hasn't looked himself. I'm shook.
577,2020-02-02 00:50:32,exezxu,Beautiful slap shot
578,2020-02-02 00:54:11,exezxu,Rooney is the future.
579,2020-02-02 01:09:43,exezxu,Use this as Stevens' job interview and hire the man as head coach!
580,2020-02-02 01:26:54,exezxu,Bishop fills up so much of the net by just standing there...
581,2020-02-02 02:33:48,exezxu,Nico is so over this shit. He’s just getting trashed by dirty hits all game.
582,2020-02-02 02:34:06,exezxu,Don't like the way Nico took that hit
583,2020-02-02 02:49:32,exezxu,Cangi with the Wayne Rooney call....would love to see Wayne on skates instead of cleets

592,2020-02-02 01:41:03,exezxu,Hughes looks better than the Nashville game. Would be nice if he got better line mates though.
593,2020-02-02 01:55:47,exezxu,That replay camera angle just showed all 5 guys looking at the puck behind the net
594,2020-02-02 02:36:54,exezxu,Don't know if that hit on Nico was dirty or not. But you can't have one of your best players getting hit again and again without any response. Someone needs to do something to wake everyone else up.
595,2020-02-02 02:38:38,exezxu,"Hit Nico again you fucks, he only gets better when you do. Suck it!"

617,2020-02-02 02:56:21,exezxu,Nas sucks as much as Hynes. That line had no business being out there as a combo in OT.

654,2020-02-02 00:59:14,exezxu,Fuckin Central division scum!
655,2020-02-02 01:10:57,exezxu,The 2000 team members there have to be slightly embarrassed at how much this team lets other teams push them around and take cheap shots at our star players. Never would’ve flied with them.
656,2020-02-02 01:24:20,exezxu,completely forgot Joe Pavelski was on Dallas

672,2020-02-02 02:55:05,exezxu,Well at least the refs owned their mistake there.
673,2020-02-02 02:55:55,exezxu,Fuck..   Let's go Roach.

676,2020-02-02 02:56:25,exezxu,typical
677,2020-02-02 02:57:14,exezxu,So predictable
678,2020-02-02 03:20:12,exezxu,"We all hop on the “Subban bad” train but most of our defensemen are shit. The best are Subban and Vats. Everyone makes mistakes, and it seems defense constantly makes mistakes. That being said, Vats and Subban most of the time show up. If we are talking about trading defensemen, we gotta trade sevo seeing how allegedly wants out, and id personally say butcher as we could probably get a good pick for him"
679,2020-02-02 01:34:59,exezxu,Nico is back 😱
680,2020-02-02 00:39:49,exezxu,I feel like Coleman and Hughes would be really good linemates
681,2020-02-02 02:43:05,exezxu,If Vats is hurt for any extended period of time that fucks yo trading him that’s gonna suck.
682,2020-02-02 02:49:13,exezxu,When did the Devils sign Wayne Rooney?
683,2020-02-02 02:51:29,exezxu,We’re gonna lose in OT. Hope I’m wrong but yea.
684,2020-02-02 02:55:41,exezxu,God this fucking team is so painful to watch.
685,2020-02-02 00:38:57,exezxu,Those less than 2ft pass to the guy skating right next to me passes aint going to get the job done tonight boys...
686,2020-02-02 02:34:27,exezxu,another high hit on nico
687,2020-02-02 02:49:53,exezxu,That was a horrendous hook on simmer behind the play
688,2020-02-01 23:55:19,exezxu,Checking in from 122 row 10
689,2020-02-02 00:10:08,exezxu,God I miss this song so much.
690,2020-02-02 00:19:12,exezxu,Lets go Devils!
691,2020-02-02 00:30:30,exezxu,Holy shit they finally changed the PP breakout.

695,2020-02-02 01:52:05,exezxu,And that would have all been Andy Greene’s fault. god he looks lost out there.
696,2020-02-02 01:59:46,exezxu,Butcher is beyond brutal this year. The hell happened to him?
697,2020-02-02 02:16:28,exezxu,Would be interested to see what the 2000 Veterans thoughts about 3v3 OT are (if we make it there tonight)
698,2020-02-02 02:16:57,exezxu,Lol did anyone else see the Ducks graphic they threw up for a second?
699,2020-02-02 02:37:50,exezxu,Labeling a hockey rink would be a sweet retirement gig.  A few hours work a few days a week...walking around with a water sprayer or whatever they are using
700,2020-02-02 02:40:39,exezxu,Please stop giving bishop free chances to start the breakout.
701,2020-02-02 02:46:54,exezxu,Our defensemen hold onto the puck way too long and take too long to pass it when someone is closing down in them
702,2020-02-02 02:53:30,exezxu,Sometimes I watch severson play and It’s just like he doesn’t even know what the end goal is...possession is crucial in OT MORON

707,2020-02-02 00:50:24,exezxu,All a result of Greene’s blind clear that didn’t get out of d zone.
708,2020-02-02 01:54:50,exezxu,Our defense is pathetic. I’m so tired of that blind clear it at all costs that results in a turnover at the blue line and the other team holding the zone more.
709,2020-02-02 02:24:26,exezxu,turnovers lead to goals! Every game
710,2020-02-02 02:45:20,exezxu,"Kyle was a Ranger fan as a kid... Why are they re-writing history?

711,2020-02-02 02:56:11,exezxu,Another pathetic loss
712,2020-02-02 02:56:58,exezxu,Couldn’t have had a worse set of a defending lineup there
713,2020-02-02 01:36:48,exezxu,Dallas is such an unlikeable team. A real collection of scumbags on that team.
714,2020-02-02 02:26:27,exezxu,This PP unit has some of the dumbest players on the team on it. That’s how you know Kowalsky is a fucking idiot.
715,2020-02-02 02:55:05,exezxu,Benn is a dirty fuck. Shame Palms didn’t board him from behind after Nicos attempt
716,2020-02-02 02:57:40,exezxu,"welp i stepped away for 10 seconds and i knew this would happen.

hughes should not have turned back to follow on the initial drop pass, gusev probably should've taken the 2nd man, subban should've realized there are people crashing to the net. i dunno. this is mostly my fault for leaving. sorry boys i'll be better next time."
717,2020-02-02 02:38:45,exezxu,And someone here wanted to tell me Benn isn’t dirty earlier when he just threw that late as fuck hit on Nico that was also a bit high.
718,2020-02-02 02:55:42,exezxu,"Fuck Pavelski  
Fuck Dallas"
719,2020-02-02 02:23:17,exezxu,Thanks PK...
720,2020-02-02 00:01:38,exezxu,"Having been traded from r/dallasstars (yee haw), I will root for both teams with the exception of P. K. Subban and Corey Perry."
721,2020-02-02 01:47:54,exezxu,Greene looks like a beer leaguer playing way above his skill level right now.
722,2020-02-02 02:16:02,exezxu,"Went back and watched that sequence where Greene fell with the puck and gave the Stars an odd man rush. Our top line of forwards is on, and he decides to lap the-offensive zone by himself.... then loses the puck and gives up a scoring chance against.  Low iq devils hockey."
723,2020-02-02 02:26:44,exezxu,Ok I see that tan suit nas👀👀
724,2020-02-02 02:42:50,exezxu,Alright fuck off Stars and their cheap shots
725,2020-02-02 01:53:42,exezxu,Love Greenie but he is having a brutal night
726,2020-02-02 02:54:42,exezxu,Benn is a dirty fuck.
727,2020-02-02 01:22:30,exezxu,"No Hischier for the second, most like the rest of the game. I hope someone knocks one of their best players out of the game for their dirty bullshit. Maybe low bridge Seguin or Benn. Hell, go after both with knee on knees."
728,2020-02-01 23:53:14,exezxu,Hope they play a sound defensive game tonight. That's all I want.
729,2020-02-02 00:27:31,exezxu,Which Domingue are we getting tonight? He’s either lights out or atrocious.
730,2020-02-02 00:44:32,exezxu,Anyone know where Niedermeyer is in the building?
731,2020-02-02 00:48:41,exezxu,"Feels like the Stars are playing a much more aggressive, physical game so far than the stats indicate"
732,2020-02-02 00:49:27,exezxu,Where Tyler Seguin’s “A”?
733,2020-02-02 01:13:21,exezxu,"Alright, boys!

This is going well so far. But for my birthday, I want a W. It's not asking too much, is it?"
734,2020-02-02 01:21:05,exezxu,Where can I get one of those patches?
735,2020-02-02 01:28:20,exezxu,SCOTTY!
736,2020-02-02 02:16:22,exezxu,"I saw you, ducks logo"

738,2020-02-02 02:28:40,exezxu,Palms going for the backhand windmill at the point?
739,2020-02-02 02:34:44,exezxu,Somebody please remind me the next time there’s a goal against and we see somebody tie up a stick on the way to the net mouth. Seriously. Light me up. I want to know if I’m just going insane or this squad just refuses to play elementary defense.
740,2020-02-02 02:48:52,exezxu,Wood dumped someone behind the net lol
741,2020-02-02 02:49:51,exezxu,Stand still defense
742,2020-02-02 02:50:11,exezxu,CHANGE PK
743,2020-02-02 02:52:47,exezxu,And we’re headed to OT again
744,2020-02-02 02:29:59,exezxu,This team has some solid skill guys but I don’t think I’ve seen a group with a lower overall hockey IQ.
745,2020-02-02 02:40:09,exezxu,I hope Nico spears the next sack of shit that cheap shots him.
746,2020-02-02 01:29:47,exezxu,"This team is a fucking disaster in the defensive zone.  Greene also toast. I know this sub loves him, but he’s god awful now"
747,2020-02-02 02:21:28,exezxu,Palms took himself out of a high danger scoring chance by floating more towards the boards.... this team has a serious hockey sense issue lol.
748,2020-02-01 23:57:35,exezxu,The 2000 nostalgia is the only reason I’m watching right now
749,2020-02-02 00:00:22,exezxu,Definitely enjoying the 2000 SCF stuff. I remember that 2OT vividly
750,2020-02-02 02:31:38,exezxu,Max Weinberg in the house!
751,2020-02-02 02:40:52,exezxu,It’s like grown men playing high school kids. Too much physicality.
752,2020-02-02 02:48:06,exezxu,Just came back to watching this game and saw that they had tied the game!
753,2020-02-02 02:57:22,exezxu,Like what the fuck was that read PK
754,2020-02-02 02:40:00,exezxu,"Miles shoulda just taken out Bishop there, apparently it’s never a penalty if the goalies out of his crease"
755,2020-02-02 02:23:54,exezxu,Coleman got bit for being lazy
756,2020-02-02 02:47:29,exezxu,"nah sorry Cang, not interested in that traitor Kovalchuk. hes dead to me"
757,2020-02-02 00:10:30,exezxu,"I dont care how you feel about him, the guy built and managed an elite team for decades.  The booing of Lou is getting really old, especially on a night like tonight."
758,2020-02-02 00:00:19,exezxu,I defended gomer when he finished his career as a devil as he actually worked hard for a contract and was decent...But I dont want to hear him talk around marty and dano. You left in your prime for the sworn enemy...fuck off. Maybe it's just bc of the season were having I feel that way.
759,2020-02-02 00:41:31,exezxu,So anyone selling an extra ring?
760,2020-02-02 02:23:53,exezxu,Lol this team is such a shit show... literally make two mistakes tonight both in the back of the net. You can’t have worse karma.
761,2020-02-02 01:55:29,exezxu,Our coaching staff are as fucking dumb as our players. At what point do you realize the clear attempts aren’t working lol?
762,2020-02-02 02:25:28,exezxu,How is Severson not on the IR with his head so far up his ass?
763,2020-02-02 01:55:10,exezxu,[deleted]
764,2020-02-01 23:53:50,exezxu,You the man Widdy
765,2020-02-02 00:01:06,exezxu,Coming through like  ... I can't come up with anything... thank you widdy
766,2020-02-02 00:44:01,exezxu,Thanks Widdy!
767,2020-02-02 00:22:08,exezxu,Goosebumps? Bruh i started tearing up
768,2020-02-02 00:17:35,exezxu,"While I agree Marty’s the GOAT, i can at least see the case for Hasek and Roy."
769,2020-02-02 00:17:12,exezxu,Goosebumps man.
770,2020-02-02 00:17:23,exezxu,Needs more Elias-Sykora bromance.
771,2020-02-02 02:56:55,exezxu,And goose was somehow the only one that attempted to play defense
772,2020-02-02 01:42:15,exezxu,Did you know he’s (Domi) terrified of finding out if he has cte?
773,2020-02-02 00:25:06,exezxu,"I feel like the Conference finals was too much of a win.  It was like they treated that like the finals, then went on with nothing left."
774,2020-02-02 00:53:18,exezxu,Sadly that's not how it works for the Devils
775,2020-02-02 00:53:01,exezxu,You mean Rooney just happened to be where Blake was getting his work done.
776,2020-02-02 00:53:27,exezxu,Rooney and Hayden in back to back games. DEPTH
777,2020-02-02 02:49:16,exezxu,"Cangi is one of the best. We've been blessed with great ones. Before him, we had Doc Emrick for a long time."
778,2020-02-02 02:51:33,exezxu,He does MLS Red Bulls games too...a little different commentary but still the same passion during big plays and goals
779,2020-02-02 00:51:53,exezxu,All hail the mighty pickle!
780,2020-02-02 00:19:53,exezxu,I legit lost it. I didn’t see it coming.
781,2020-02-02 00:52:19,exezxu,"Was ""unassisted"" according to the PA. Lmao fat chance."
782,2020-02-02 00:15:49,exezxu,Nieds is one of those players who would be incredible in every single era of NHL hockey.
783,2020-02-02 01:06:49,exezxu,"Seriously. Season's in the crapper, just sit out. No reason to put the rest of the extension in jeopardy."
784,2020-02-02 02:39:33,exezxu,Yea we basically been watching them grow up for the past 2+ seasons. Maybe time to cutaway to some other people after a goal?
785,2020-02-02 01:02:55,exezxu,I've been saying this. Its FUCKING EMBARRASSING! *kicks trash can*
786,2020-02-02 01:36:06,exezxu,That's cause he has twin xl mattresses for pads
787,2020-02-02 02:36:10,exezxu,Don’t worry. Miles wood and John Hayden to the rescue. The stars are gonna be shaking in their boots the next time they try to run one of our guys /s
788,2020-02-02 02:42:20,exezxu,"Seriously, the way he braced was weird. Worked out tho"
789,2020-02-02 00:23:55,exezxu,Same. Really want to see Petr skate with the cup.
790,2020-02-02 00:28:48,exezxu,I legitimately just had this same thought for the first time in 20 years. I assume something with a constant cycle of cryogenic freezing and thawing.
791,2020-02-02 00:50:11,exezxu,well i guess it really was a December to Remember if we’re still talking about it
792,2020-02-02 01:22:07,exezxu,I teared up
793,2020-02-02 01:56:21,exezxu,Very bad optics
794,2020-02-02 00:39:43,exezxu,Been dead for the last few games now.
795,2020-02-02 01:24:10,exezxu,Fucking ridiculous nothing was called on that cross check from that fucking giraffe on skates that’s one of the softest big men in the history of the sport.
796,2020-02-02 01:56:49,exezxu,What’s really annoying about that was how he was being held clear as day and nothing was called.
797,2020-02-02 01:59:20,exezxu,It was Greene I thought?
798,2020-02-02 02:56:39,exezxu,We need the walrus
799,2020-02-02 00:35:20,exezxu,"Wood, however, is pure quit"
800,2020-02-02 00:35:01,exezxu,Sure is looking like it
801,2020-02-02 00:39:48,exezxu,Hes just come back from 22 months off for concussion related headaches. Hes always played a really physical game and Im guessing hes tryng to prove he still can.
802,2020-02-02 02:13:19,exezxu,Fitting he’s clueless on that sequence given how clueless the players were.
803,2020-02-02 00:29:07,exezxu,He's so inconsistent. Some days he looks unbeatable and other days he can't stop a beach ball
804,2020-02-02 00:28:38,exezxu,"he’s either unreal or god awful.

how he does tonight remains to be seem."
805,2020-02-02 01:52:25,exezxu,Been like that most of the season outside of a handful of games. He can not be back next year.
806,2020-02-02 02:46:57,exezxu,Next game they should bring in 10 HOF cup winners to watch them. Maybe something like that might be enough to motivate them /s
807,2020-02-02 06:29:13,exezxu,"I’m gong to get downvoted for this but idc, subban is overrated. He’s an offensive defenceman who doesn’t know what back checking is. How many shots does this guy need to hit off the opponent’s shin pads to understand he’s not the best defenceman in the league?  He’s not worth what we’re paying him and we’re stuck with him. No one will want him now"
808,2020-02-02 00:46:10,exezxu,"I know everyone loves the Coleman-Zajac-Gusev line, but I'd love to see if they could get Jack going centering a line like that."
809,2020-02-02 00:46:45,exezxu,"I was just thinking how Hughes and Zajac should be swapped. See how that goes, nothing to lose."
810,2020-02-02 00:45:26,exezxu,Have they been together yet at all?
811,2020-02-02 02:56:59,exezxu,:/
812,2020-02-02 00:40:15,exezxu,bright side... they connected on a pass!
813,2020-02-02 16:27:33,exezxu,[you were saying?](https://www.reddit.com/r/DallasStars/comments/ew1eg1/benn_is_a_feisty_boy_but_hes_a_clean_captain/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)
814,2020-02-02 02:48:18,exezxu,Read the last two paragraphs of the article.
815,2020-02-02 02:06:21,exezxu,I mean except Perry there aren’t
816,2020-02-02 16:29:10,exezxu,[you were saying?](https://www.reddit.com/r/DallasStars/comments/ew1eg1/benn_is_a_feisty_boy_but_hes_a_clean_captain/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)
817,2020-02-02 03:00:51,exezxu,I can’t blame goose for that one. PK had like a 40 foot gap to close on the puck and I wouldn’t play those odds either.
818,2020-02-02 02:44:23,exezxu,I’d love to see a young Scott Stevens pull a Lindros on him..
819,2020-02-02 16:23:10,exezxu,How about !rangers
820,2020-02-02 02:26:52,exezxu,"That was on Colman, he got lazy there."
821,2020-02-02 00:10:53,exezxu,Same. Maybe they'll fight!
822,2020-02-02 00:27:20,exezxu,You'll learn to like PK. Just not his actual hockey ability
823,2020-02-02 02:22:57,exezxu,So it was Greene.
824,2020-02-02 16:29:31,exezxu,[you were saying?](https://www.reddit.com/r/DallasStars/comments/ew1eg1/benn_is_a_feisty_boy_but_hes_a_clean_captain/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)
825,2020-02-02 00:00:03,exezxu,All I want is a million dollars.
826,2020-02-02 00:01:32,exezxu,If you get that wish they'll finally play sound defensively and then score 1 or less lol
827,2020-02-02 00:49:07,exezxu,i’d imagine they gave the 2000 team a suite somewhere
828,2020-02-02 00:51:03,exezxu,I'm sitting above the usual devils box and it looks pretty empty. Could use him on the ice tho.
829,2020-02-02 01:55:38,exezxu,"http://imgur.com/gallery/HYg48In

In the usual devils box. First row in the photo. Leather jacket. Below 132. Please don't accost the man."
830,2020-02-02 00:51:51,exezxu,They took it when he dove
831,2020-02-02 01:26:25,exezxu,Happy Birthday! Hope you get your wish.
832,2020-02-02 01:26:01,exezxu,Probably check Ebay in a few days and they will be there
833,2020-02-02 02:31:52,exezxu,Idk why you’re getting downvoted. The hockey sense is not there for 90% of this team. Even guys that have their hockey sense praised look lost half the time.
834,2020-02-02 02:37:54,exezxu,Zero aggression besides the 4th line and a few spurts from the Hughes line. Looks like a rec league game.
835,2020-02-02 02:42:44,exezxu,Varsity team playing vs JV or Freshman team
836,2020-02-02 02:41:44,exezxu,Gimme dat Byfield
837,2020-02-02 00:11:07,exezxu,"They were saying Lou, not boo."
838,2020-02-02 00:11:26,exezxu,I think they are saying Louuuu...    like they used to.
839,2020-02-02 00:22:15,exezxu,Every high profile guy besides Elias left us. It is what it is. Lou lets his top guys leave and doesn’t pay them.
840,2020-02-02 01:55:49,exezxu,That was carrick
841,2020-02-02 01:55:40,exezxu,"That was Carrick, not Andy"
842,2020-02-02 00:24:08,exezxu,I'll take the 5th on that front
843,2020-02-02 00:19:44,exezxu,There's a case of course. But they're not Marty.
844,2020-02-02 01:44:47,exezxu,Do you blame him? Slowly losing yourself is scary shit
845,2020-02-02 00:28:48,exezxu,That Kings team was on a different level though. They had lost like once or twice all playoffs coming into the series
846,2020-02-02 01:13:05,exezxu,All hail Pickle Rick! I mean Pickle Blake!
847,2020-02-02 00:23:01,exezxu,"I didn't either, and it made so much sense too"
848,2020-02-02 01:04:03,exezxu,"Even at the end of the period, Dallas fucks just standing over Nico, all we get is a weak shove out of Palms... it’s fucking pathetic!"
849,2020-02-02 01:43:14,exezxu,"No wonder we have trouble scoring, I had trouble scoring on my twin XL mattress freshman year."
850,2020-02-02 00:35:57,exezxu,Black dont crack so it can be hard to tell
851,2020-02-02 00:40:20,exezxu,Yeah I haven’t been here haha
852,2020-02-02 02:26:07,exezxu,Cangi said Greene. Was Carrick though.
853,2020-02-02 00:51:53,exezxu,"Not that I remember, Hynes would never have broken up zajac and Coleman, which is fine they play well."
854,2020-02-02 16:59:06,exezxu,"Oh wow he decided not to kill someone in a very vulnerable situation. Totally clean player now.

Tie Domi didn't hit someone once, looking back, I think he was a clean player now too"
855,2020-02-02 02:09:53,exezxu,"Perry alone makes them that. Bishop is a big flipper. Seguin is a bit xenophobic, Benn can be dirty, Polak is as dirty as Gudas."
856,2020-02-02 02:10:57,exezxu,exactly
857,2020-02-02 03:41:06,exezxu,he was definitely least at fault out of all of them
858,2020-02-02 16:23:26,exezxu,FUCK THE RAGS!
859,2020-02-02 02:00:24,exezxu,"Gomez closest front row in the white. Steven's in the gray sweater. Elias and Robinson are also in this photo, a bit further than Stevens. There are a few others as well."
860,2020-02-02 00:55:21,exezxu,I feel like Dallas management has really been fucking with him this season.
861,2020-02-02 01:28:13,exezxu,Thanks!
862,2020-02-02 02:33:34,exezxu,"Meh. State of the fans/sub. I can go to the post game thread say the same thing and be top comment. 

In game, people tend to be a bit sensitive. At least that’s my experience (and why I tend to lurk)."
863,2020-02-02 02:50:22,exezxu,Yup. They’re soft as baby shit.
864,2020-02-02 00:11:36,exezxu,Boourns?
865,2020-02-02 00:22:02,exezxu,"Yeah it was either Patty or Marty's retirement ceremony, Bettman was in the arena and as he approaches the mic every was hoping him, then Lou got up to speak, everyone was Louing him, and he turned to Bettman and was like ""thats a bit different than the one you got"" and the crowd went nuts."
866,2020-02-02 01:59:50,exezxu,"Cangi said Andy Greene, hence the confusion."
867,2020-02-02 01:57:03,exezxu,[deleted]
868,2020-02-02 00:20:10,exezxu,bingo.
869,2020-02-02 01:48:48,exezxu,Just find it funny a guy that had no qualms scrambling other people’s brains with cheap shots is worried about his brain probably going to shit.
870,2020-02-02 01:22:29,exezxu,"It was all Quick, he was pretty much unbeatable that year."
871,2020-02-02 01:46:54,exezxu,We do have a young team so that may explain the scoring issues this season!
872,2020-02-02 17:02:16,exezxu,"I'm sorry, but it was ONE DAMN PLAY. Chill the fuck out, man."
873,2020-02-02 02:11:46,exezxu,"Bishop has maybe flopped once this year, I’ve literally never heard anyone say Seguin was xenophobic. And the other two are kinda iffy I guess"
874,2020-02-02 02:17:11,exezxu,Polak and Perry are definitely dirty. But Benn plays hard in the same way Simmons or wood do. And every goalie on earth flops.
875,2020-02-02 16:23:48,exezxu,"Best bot in the league, I tell you."
876,2020-02-02 02:41:06,exezxu,True it’s super annoying. r/devils has changed most ways in the better but it’s certainly more of an echo chamber
877,2020-02-02 00:14:20,exezxu,Loouuuurns
878,2020-02-02 01:58:23,exezxu,Carrick and butcher were the defensemen on the ice when they scored
879,2020-02-02 01:58:46,exezxu,No it was Carrick....
880,2020-02-02 01:58:42,exezxu,That was Carrick.
881,2020-02-02 01:57:13,exezxu,I have no idea what you're talking about.  Nieds wasn't a dirty player.
882,2020-02-02 01:50:02,exezxu,Nieds didnt do any of that lol
883,2020-02-02 01:54:28,exezxu,That's how the game used to be. Stevens played the same way. If stevens played today he would get suspended all the time.
884,2020-02-02 01:59:00,exezxu,"The league has definitely gotten softer, arguably in a good way. It unfortunately lead to a system where everybody had to be aggressive and throw dangerous hits even if they didn’t necessarily agree with it."
885,2020-02-02 02:01:42,exezxu,You're getting downvoted because people were thinking you were talking about Nieds...
886,2020-02-02 01:48:03,exezxu,Jack just wants to see some titties
887,2020-02-02 17:07:42,exezxu,"I mean he did cheap shot nico at least 3 times, but sure. Stay on your own sub buddy"
888,2020-02-02 02:20:37,exezxu,Bishop is known for diving more than most.
889,2020-02-02 02:06:45,exezxu,Did I say he was? Clearly the conversation was about domi.
890,2020-02-02 01:58:06,exezxu,Did I say he did? Clearly the conversation was about domi there buddy.
891,2020-02-02 01:57:43,exezxu,Domi would intentional elbow people in the face. That’s not how the game was played even by the standard back then.
892,2020-02-02 02:00:50,exezxu,"Yea. That shit was ingrained in the spirit at every level and even in the games. Just listen to some of the commentary on any NHL game in the late 90s early 2000s, it’s wild."
893,2020-02-02 02:04:58,exezxu,Speaks to the lack of reading comprehension this place has sometimes haha.
894,2020-02-02 02:36:20,exezxu,He's got Mrs Schneids' titties in his face every night while Cory is down in Binghamton
895,2020-02-02 04:51:43,exezxu,"Clearly, after your edit to add Domi's name.  Wasn't clear before that."
896,2020-02-02 02:00:55,exezxu,"Go look at most of Stevens hits and tell me he wasn’t elbowing or using his shoulder to hit guys in the face/head. I love Stevens as much anyone else here, but he had a lot of hits to the head."
897,2020-02-02 02:05:42,exezxu,Domi would literally elbow people that didn’t have the puck. Not even close to the same.

\#1 - Shaw Lawson (Unspectacular, but good overall. Would be a harder piece to replace than most people think. Plus, he's got some mean in him that I like)

\#2 - Quintin Spain (Didn't allow a sack all year... but that doesn't make him elite. Josh Allen helped pad that stat by staying upright and escaping pressure. Will still be a good depth piece)

\#3 - LaAdrian Waddle (Good depth player who we should be able to get cheap bcs of injury. Has experience as swing tackle and is a smart, versatile player.)

Honorable Mention - Kevin Johnson (Played well as a depth piece and always looks worse when playing across from Tre White & Corey Luiget (Signed off waivers and was a pleasant surprise for rotational piece. 

 **Restricted or Exclusive Rights Free Agents:**

\#1 - Levi Wallace (What a surprise and no surprises here)

\#2 - Robert Foster (He had some hamstring issues this year and how many times did we see Foster wide open down field only to have Allen overthrow him by 20 yards. His success is directly related to Allen's deep ball success and we all know Josh struggled BIG with that. Bring him back and let him get back on the same page with his QB.)

\#3 - Isaiah McKenzie (Breaks one big play every game it seems.)

*One Year Remaining:*

\#1 - Matt Milano (He's a hustle player and someone who the Bills struggled to replace when he broke his leg in 2018.)

\#2 - Jordan Poyer (Arguably, the best safety tandem in the league should absolutely attempt to bring him back)

\#3 - Jon Feliciano (They loved this dude and he has a mean streak that simply fits in Buffalo.)

Honorable mention - Andre Roberts (He was named to the pro-bowl as an alternate and battle some injuries during the year. Always flashed potential and think another year in the system will unlock this dude.)

\*\*\* Toughest call\*\*\* Let Jordan Phillips walk. (He had a spectacular year, but the Bills have a plethora of talent at DL and can afford to pay Star and Keep Jordan. Star's contract doesn't save much money if cut so look for them to let another team pay Jordan the big bucks. Especially when they starter talend in Star, Oliver, and Harrison Phillips under contract.)

912,2020-02-06 18:59:40,ewwzk2,"Spain and Shaq should be our priorities.  Originally I was hoping to go after Ngakoue, but he'll likely be tagged, and if not, he'll command top dollar.  The more I think of it, I just dont think Shaq is going to be too expensive.  He's not phenomenal, but at he's productive in this system.

Spain is solid... if we dont resign him, I'm thinking Beane is going to go after a guy like Conklin  or another upgrade at RT and kick Ford to the inside.  I'm hoping not, because I think Ford was decent as a rookie, and Spain will be a lot cheaper than any RT upgrade.

Agreed with the other posts in this thread.  Spend the money on your own guys first.  Poyer, Milano, and like it or not, I think we need to keep Dawkins.  He's unspectcular, but a solid LT."
913,2020-02-01 00:28:58,ewwzk2,I agree.  There’s also a couple guys with one year left that I think we should firm up now. Poyer and Milano are at the top of that list.
914,2020-02-01 01:58:49,ewwzk2,Definitely. It will be interesting to see if they keep Spencer Long. He was the highest paid of Spain/Long/Feliciano but now has a fairly cheap out for his contract.
915,2020-02-03 20:53:42,ewwzk2,"Unless Beane & McDermott want to move Ford inside and draft a OT at 22nd overall pick.

935,2020-02-03 18:48:58,ewwzk2,"It's always a smart move to bring back exclusive rights free agents because of the low price points.

I'm not as high on McKenzie, and don't mind him competing for a roster spot but he has a limited skill set.

Ideally, Beane also signs Breshad Perriman in free agency and drafts a WR or 2 WR's so that Foster, McKenzie and Williams are competing for the #5 WR and #6 spots."

There are guys in the draft that can do both and if you realistically bring in 3 guys to fill out the roster after Smoke, The Bease, and Roberts there isn't much upside to keeping the pair if you think you're adding plus players to the room. Sure, sign em cheap and bring them to camp but those two guys are holding spots that must get more yards, receptions and touchdowns. There might be sentimental value here in the fan base but let's go get a pair like Laviska Shenault and KJ Hamler and a mid level free agent like Seth Roberts, Geronimo Allison or Dwayne Harris."

If he can come into training camp healthy I think he can regain some of his 2018 form.

It's a low risk high reward move to bring Robert Foster back."
940,2020-02-05 04:49:27,ewwzk2,Exactly
941,2020-02-01 01:46:06,ewwzk2,"Isaiah McKenzie had more yards this year than Geronimo Allison, Seth Roberts, or Dwayne Harris. Harris is also mostly a return guy so it would make no sense to sign him."
942,2020-02-01 02:25:34,ewwzk2,"Yes but they are not replacing McKenzie the drafted guys are. The two rookies would take more snaps as they would offer more. Your vet guy would be your special teams guy as not you're not running the two early receiver picks on teams. So that leaves your 5th and 6th guy. Andre Roberts is one but your 5th receiver needs to have value on teams  AND size. If you're satisfied with McKenzie playing the same role next year then we disagree. He's best served in the slot and there are better guys in the draft. The vets guy fill out the roster, offer teams experience and bring height and experience to the position."
943,2020-02-01 02:51:45,ewwzk2,"Beane was actively trying to get McKenzie from Denver before he got waived for the practice squad. He’s not going anywhere. He’s a great gadget player that can also fill in on kickoff/punt returns if needed. I expect him along with Brown and Beasley to be half of our wideouts next year. I’m hoping Foster and Duke can improve, but I can easily see two rookies joining the group. I think with a stronger receiving corps we’ll see more time on the field offensively and see a more productive passing game than last year."

948,2020-01-29 21:09:29,evkkbc,"I don't think anyone in this thread would agree his productions are objectively good - but I feel like that's irrelevant to the bigger picture. It's right up there: ""no matter the merit"". Tyler Perry's films **make money**. All of them. There isn't a script on that table that won't at least break even. History will reveal him as the Roger Corman of the 21st century - recycling actors, sets... turning out script after script, production after production each on the smallest budget possible, piggybacking one onto another, yielding a massive body of work that while largely unwatchable, never lost a dime.

Make a good movie or make a lot of money making bad movies? Most people can barely dream of doing either. Questioning the quality of these scripts sidesteps the point. No matter how bad his films are - he's doing something right, and that's what I want to learn. That's what I find fascinating. That's where I find value in what he's doing."

I think Ad Astra was a really great film... but do I like it better than Dark Star? Each achieves something the other couldn't and i'm thankful both exist. For every bloated, boring, big budget studio turkey (or crowning achievement in filmmmaking for that matter), there's a couple thousand self-indulgent, half-baked, poorly-acted, barely watchable microbudget flicks making their way through the festival circuit. It's all important.
Back on topic: I don't think Tyler Perry thinks for a second every page he writes is gold. He doesn't win awards. He doesn't break the box office. He doesn't even get good reviews. He does, however, get checks. Lots of checks. I think we can all agree there's no how-to, shortcut, or easy way to get rich off making a movie or else most of us would have done it by now. I don't need to like Perry's films to appreciate the work he's doing and admire they way he's turned something as god awful and unrelenting as Madea into an empire.

I think the _success_ can be emulated 100% if we look at in turns of **fulfilling potential**. The man decided to be as **industrious** as he could, on every task and opportunity, and this includes not wasting energy in trying be something he isn’t, and I’m fully investing in his own work.  
And it’s all well and good saying that, but I find myself realising down the line that I wasn’t aware of some of the choices I’m making. 

I notice that everybody has access to gear now, but only 1% of people are actually willing to do ALL the work on a low/no budget feature.  /r/indiefilm is full of people who are so consumed with the idea that they have **taste**, but don’t have the taste to record adr or foley, or really any technical attention to detail tbh. Everybody is fooling themselves by submitting to meaningless festivals, and this _taste_ won’t even reveal to them that they can’t pay people to watch their stuff.  
I’m not bitter, but more excited because I can see that it’s kind of wide open. It might take a bag of humility to undo the fallacy tho

It also depends on how you consider success. Perry is definitely successful as far as box office returns go, but critically? That's a different story.

972,2020-01-30 05:25:12,evkkbc,"I feel like it can't be explained away entirely as industry.  I feel like to do so dismisses the voice he found within himself and that his audience connects to.

Perry grew up broke, never finished high school, moved to Atlanta and got his start with stage plays. He spent two years and every peny he had on his first - which was a bomb he rewrote and restaged for 6 years until it made a profit. He kept writing more and took these on the road, doing up to like 300 shows a year. I would think watching your scripts and actors play out every night in front of a live audience, being able to retool and redirect every night - to see what sort of things inspire reactions and what kind some nights, and others night would have an incredible impact on the way you learn to tell stories, write dialogue, etc. He made enough money to fund his first film *Diary of a Mad Black Woman* for $5.5M. It grossed $50.5M – and also has a 16% Rotten Tomatoes rating... aaaaand this just kept happening with every film. Oprah recruited him to bring scripted TV to OWN and it's been dollar dollar bills ever since.

I think his work ethic has paid off in a lot of ways. Working out of his own pocket gave him the creative freedom to create the template for this extremely profitable garbage. His grass roots beginnings in stage plays and independent film cultivated a loyal African-American audience. And obviously - the man writes, and writes, and writes, and writes, and writes. The more you do it, the easier it gets. Like Woody Allen or John Hughes, i'm guessing it takes Tyler Perry a week to write a film. It looks like his budgets are still around $5M - which means he probably just works fast, and takes really good care of his cast and crew, because the dude already owns his own self-contained studio with sets, sound stages, gear, housing, etc.

All that said, this is what BuzzfeedNews said about his latest *A Fall From Grace*:

""Perry’s sloppy execution of his own questionable ideas continues to disappoint. The [downtrodden black woman trope](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/17/movies/tyler-perrys-a-fall-from-grace-review.html) is so [inescapable in Perry’s work](https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-a-fall-from-grace-and-tyler-perry-movies-punish-black-womens-desires) that it practically feels like self-parody at this point.

982,2020-01-29 12:01:00,evjy13,"SJ fan here. Not only has Yueill been transformed from a timid playmaker with great vision who struggled to stay up to pace in MLS to a bona fide point 6 by the earthbound god that is Matias Almeyda, he’s also the ideal manager to carry out the vision of our DoF Jesse Fioranelli of developing academy players. 

Almeyda is a model citizen, has experience in developing youngsters, and takes pride in doing just that. 

JT Marcinkowski is a huge talent, right up there with David Ochoa as best young GK. Marcinkowski will become the best passing goalkeeper in the pool if he isn’t already. Not going to start this year due to the Olympic team but our current starter probably will not be around in 2021.

Fuentes, while still a very nice player and has loads of potential, hasn’t progressed quite as much as I might’ve hoped in the last 2 years. Mainly he’s a crisp passer but needs to develop bite and mobility (same issues as Yueill). He’s a big talent but certainly not on Dortmund’s radar anymore like he was when he was 15 (couldn’t have signed until age 18 anyways)

Cade Cowell is a physical specimen, page merchant, and powerful striker. He’s not unskilled, he has some technique and finishing ability 1v1, but to say his game isn’t predicated on athleticism and explosiveness would be incorrect. Seriously, his vertical is like well over 40” and his straight line speed is as good as anybody on the team and he’s 16 and 1 month right now. Huge talent.

As for Casey Walls, he’s another current US youth international. Left footed CB, shows poise (and sometimes not) on the ball and technically capable passer. We’ll see how he develops physically, potentially even in height, in the coming years

All these 15/16/17 year old players are training with the 1st team full time after impressing Almeyda previously.

Nick Lima is a great professional and reliable defender but we have plenty of right backs. Unlikely to play for USA again as much as in 2019. Needs to go to Europe to take next level and is capable of he wants. Had a great trial with Hertha Berlin last year, did well.

Thompson is honestly the same exact player as Sergino Dest. Dest’s exposure to the Ajax first team probably has meant he’s permanently surpassed TT but after Almeyda made TT a RB he basically became the Sergino Dest of MLS

Yueill’s level took a quantum leap in 2019 due to Almeyda, easily the best American on SJ and one of the best Americans in MLS. He is the main reason to watch San Jose from a USMNT perspective"
983,2020-01-29 08:57:26,evjy13,"This is great, thanks for putting it together"
984,2020-01-29 13:06:06,evjy13,That 15 yr old keeper would be fun to watch I think he's like 6'5 already too
985,2020-01-29 16:53:41,evjy13,"Giving DC a green rating is def a bit generous. Maybe if Canouse returns to his 2018 form and is back in the conversation for DM, but even then his game just isn’t what Berhalter wants there (he’s pretty much and out-and-out destroyer). Arriola is fun as hell to watch but it’s not like he’s much different playing for club than country, and any USMNT fan probably knows (and underrates) what he contributes. It’ll be hard for any of our promising youngsters to get minutes this year as well, but they’ll be getting plenty for Loudon."
986,2020-01-29 21:42:36,evjy13,Great work!
987,2020-01-29 15:59:12,evjy13,"Shinyashiki would be a realistic guy to call in if he were a citizen already, but he doesn't even have his green card and I don't think he is eligible for any expedited naturalization path (unless he gets married to an American, I guess). We'd be looking at 2025 at the absolute soonest before he would be eligible, which is a long way out."
988,2020-01-30 01:42:35,evjy13,"I hate this because you beat me to it. I’m still going to do it, but closer to the first match after a few final transfers go through (1 Bobby Wood please, to help my team). Mine was/will be a little different so it won’t feel too much like a duplicate. 

That said, good stuff. I can’t wait for MLS to kick off. Hopefully my team gives me more a reason to watch this year. I couldn’t stand watching every single team out perform us last year so I avoided watching other teams. Helped my mood only a little since I still watched FCC.

I think our best players to watch from a USA-perspective are Amaya, Vazquez, and Bailey. The battle for LB could also be intriguing. And all of this depends on the final signings we’ve been promised. A DP 10 will likely see Amaya play less than last year. If Wood or another striker comes in then Vazquez will be limited. Bailey is a RB but I could see him as a super sub winger."
989,2020-01-29 17:11:49,evjy13,How can you rank ATL yellow but Cincy and the Revs green? Lol
990,2020-01-29 15:12:09,evjy13,"I haven't seen Cowell and Walls specifically, just clips here and there in highlight form, so maybe a little skewed. I like Fuentes when I've seen him play with the US and SJ but I feel as if he's stagnated since I first saw him. He probably needs to be a focal point for Reno this year and then try to make a jump to first team. Being focal point for Reno will be no small task though. Marcinkowski is one I like, and I liked that when Ralston took over he just let JT play. He could learn from mistakes and get better that way. I think JT needs to either be a cup game guy behind Vega, or start every game for Reno until Vega is done.

&#x200B;

Lima is someone who I actually like at LB and I'm unsure why he never got any run there for the USMNT when he was getting called into camps and the RB spot was getting filled. The LB position is quite bare with proven LB's and it sounds like that might be the position for Lima with SJ if he wants to play consistently. Otherwise he needs to get a move to another MLS team who can use a RB or move abroad even if it's not to a top league.

In Thompson's case I've been low-key on the Thompson bandwagon for a RB call-up. With Dest being the go to at LB currently until some others rise up the ranks, I would love to see Thompson in competition with Cannon/Yedlin. The key for Thompson is just making sure he can defend consistently. I love the idea of having a converted, technical CM with the ball skills Tommy possesses. I am fully on board for a March call-up with Cannon likely going with u-23's. Hopefully he can start off hot in March when MLS starts up."
991,2020-01-29 15:52:21,evjy13,Came here to say this.
992,2020-01-29 17:52:25,evjy13,"Absolutely, that was one I was leery about and thought it could end up in the red category when all is said and done. If the youngsters go to Loudon say Yow, Paredes, and Nyeman I would probably bump them down to a yellow rating because in hindsight Hamid and Arriola are the only consistent starters right now for DC. Canouse needs to regain form, but this wasn't necessarily rating them in comparison to GB's system, though I could see a shift to more of a destroyer to align the player pool more."
993,2020-01-29 18:01:52,evjy13,"Canouse is good at what he does, but he isn't the type of DM that Berhalter is looking for. He'll be behind Adams, Yuell, Trapp, and (maybe) Bradley.

The only interesting players for DC United are Yow and Arriola. But it's not worth watching for Yow... he made like 2 or 3 appearances last season and would always physically be separated from the ball because he looks like he weighs about 90 pounds.  But yeah, I bet he'll do well at Loudoun this year and it'll be another year or two before he's making regular appearances for DC United."
994,2020-01-29 16:08:26,evjy13,"That's fair. I don't know the details, thought he might be on the same path as Gressel, except without the marriage. Here's to hoping he could hustle up that process and has a desire to play. Not likely."
995,2020-01-30 02:20:10,evjy13,"No problem, the more perspectives the better IMO.

FC Cincinnati is intriguing from this perspective. Hoping they’re more competitive so I can watch full games, no offense. I really like Gutman and hope he wins the battle at LB. I like what I’ve heard from Zico Bailey as a RB and I hope he gets to be apart of the rotation if not surprise some and win a job (I know, not likely). A Vazquez/Wood striker options would be cool from a USMNT perspective. Anyway they’d be 1st and 2nd strikers as a rotation? Or is there another striker? I think Amaya could be as good as any DP they bring in, but needs more weapons around him. I was impressed when he got opportunities last year.

Looking forward to reading your input!"
996,2020-01-29 18:04:52,evjy13,"Cincy has a ton of US eligible players who have been in or are around the player pool. They are actually really high up on my must watch list in perspective of watching USMNT eligible players. I see what you're saying with the Revs, and they could easily be bumped down to a yellow rating. Like I said in the writing though, I like Brandon Bye and Dejuan Jones who are at least shouts in comparison to the USMNT pool. Matt Turner adds some value to the rating, and then seeing how they care for Rennicks and Angking specifically could move them up or down IMO. 

In answer to ATL, it may be the sour taste I have in my mouth about how they've progressed the homegrowns or what not but I just don't have much faith in ATL system with young American players. Guzan and Robinson are the only likely starters right now for Atlanta and Guzan is one that I wish would not appear in the red, white and blue again. Hyndman has the oppportunity, but we will see how he performs going into the season, but I am really excited for his development this season. The only other 1st team players for ATL of USMNT interest for me is Bello and it sounds like they're bringing in players to play over him as well. Robinson and Hyndman I'll be watching for sure but I'm in a wait and see mode for ATL."
997,2020-01-29 15:55:32,evjy13,"I haven’t watched as much SJ over the last couple of seasons, but I always thought Lima was interesting for LB depth. How do you guys think his defending has come along?  He has great physical tools."
998,2020-01-30 02:35:23,evjy13,"Amaya was a bright spot last year. But yeah, we sucked. It was hard to watch as a fan. Can’t imagine we had many neutral viewers. 

Gutman wasn’t too impressive to me last season but the whole team wasn’t impressive. A fit Garza I think could be a starter for USA though."
999,2020-01-30 07:06:27,evjy13,"You’ve overrated Cincy, imo. Amaya is interesting if small. But after that I don’t have much interest. I think Miles Robinson alone is probably more interesting to me as an USMNT fan with Hyndman and Bello as bonuses.

I will watch Philly, Dallas and maybe Colorado religiously. Bassett looks ready to break out. 

I doubt we see the top San Jose kids this year, but I suspect Walls and Cowell both have legit USMNT upside. Maybe Akanyirige as well. And both Walls and Akanyirige looks to be USYNT staples."
1000,2020-01-29 16:06:26,evjy13,"I think Lima is a good fullback. I can't honestly say I've ever gotten to watch him enough in MLS to judge by those appearances, but with USMNT I think he's been a capable defender."
1001,2020-01-30 13:17:46,evjy13,"Cicncy may be a more to each their own situation. I am also interested in Amaya but he probably won’t start as of now. I have always been interested in Gutman if he can win the LB spot and with the LB situation the USMNT has currently I will take as many LB’s that are playing well. If that’s Gutman, then great so I’ll watch for him. Zico Bailey is an intriguing prospect who’s played with USYNT’s before and I believe is apart of the Kleiban’s little “clan”. Stanko, Gyau, Wood now, Vazquez all play a position where the USMNT are not deep currently so if it’s a depth option who never sees a camp, I’m still interested in watching. You could even count Manneh in that list who has been once a touted prospect who seemed like he might put it together last year but left me hanging a little bit, I want to his year to year development. Anybody else is a bonus there, so I rated green because of the quantity not necessarily quality for FCC. Atl is interesting as yeah I love to watch Robinson, and am excited to see Hyndman try to lock a spot down, but Bello has probably fallen one of the furthest I’ve seen in a prospect in the last year and a half in the current pool. Will look to see if he puts it together. 

I agree on the 3 you pointed out, NYCFC might be up there for me as well, preferably not a home game but it is what it is. 

And totally agree with the SJ observation. They’ll probably bide their time at Reno for now and the respective USYNT’s. SJ is interesting to me because I would love Tommy Thompson to develop into a top 4 USMNT RB which I don’t think he’s very off currently IMO. The combination of converted, creative midfielder to RB who is sufficient on defense could be a smaller version of a Dest-like player."

1023,2020-01-28 06:29:39,ev0n4d,Makes sense. Dominant hand on the bottom = power and top = finesse. Daniel was the shooter and Henrik was the playmaker.

1036,2020-01-28 15:33:23,ev0n4d,"Are you left-handed? That's backwards. Throwing is the dominant hand part of that. And for goalies, your blocker side requires more strength and coordination since you need to control both your blocker and stick. And generally kids are taught to catch/throw before becoming a goalie so it's logical to catch with the same hand. 

You're just 100% wrong about all of this."
1037,2020-01-28 10:54:39,ev0n4d,Yeah its called mirroring or mirror twins.

Same is for Sweden. Don't know about other European countries."
1047,2020-01-28 05:30:23,ev0n4d,I think having your dominant had at the top also helps with pokechecks and breaking up passes if you have to reach with only one arm.

1051,2020-01-28 15:35:51,ev0n4d,Which Henrik did (righty shooting left). Daniel was a lefty that shot left.
1052,2020-01-28 06:31:18,ev0n4d,"You mean, in Russia? Most schools teach kids to write right-handed even if they're lefties or at the very least give it a damn good try. Very few actually *force* kids and it rarely happens without kids' parents' agreement. We make such a big deal of it because we write a lot at schools and unis (and we have to do it fast), and you can smear your handwriting all over the paper if you write left-handed."
1053,2020-01-28 05:37:15,ev0n4d,"I'd just go with whatever feels most natural. One isn't ""right"" or ""wrong"", just different philosophies. Either way you'll have to build and develop a lot of skill and that will matter a lot more than which handedness you chose."
1054,2020-01-28 13:04:23,ev0n4d,"I guess if that’s what you feel but as a righty who plays with my right on the bottom I don’t feel I’m losing any ability to pokecheck or break up passes with my non dominant hand. You have limited control to begin with when you have your one off hand on the stick anyway. It’s just a learning preference, once you’ve played for years you’ve basically taught your brain how to use both hand effectively no matter what side you choose."
1055,2020-01-28 07:06:13,ev0n4d,"That's how I feel, way more natural to control the stick with your dominant hand."
1056,2020-01-28 05:24:33,ev0n4d,"I am like nearly positive you are talking about a comment I made 


It was on a post about how American player make up 1/3 of the right handed players in the nhl 

In Canada you are generally taught to strong hand at the top, because many Canadians start so young, they do not have very much dexterity in both hands so it helps a lot for them when they are starting


That is not really taught the same way in the USA 

And also in baseball righty hitters are like way more common, so it was kinda an assumption that most people in the USA would play tball before hockey, and thus keeping the same motion would make them a righty shooter in hockey 


Or maybe Americans are just psychopaths"

1058,2020-01-28 18:44:33,ev0n4d,"the idea brings up a lot of questions like nature vs nurture, and potential to prove/disprove sexuality is a trait you're born with. 

Mirror twins have tangible evidence, it's not as abstract as one being left handed and the other opposite, also there are physical features like hairlines being reversed among other things.

It's an interesting idea."
1059,2020-01-28 17:12:39,ev0n4d,"Yeah, you're right.  I misread it."
1060,2020-01-28 13:39:11,ev0n4d,Exactly. My suspicion is that Ovechkin is a natural lefty who was forced to write right handed rather than actually ambidextrous.
1061,2020-01-28 05:39:26,ev0n4d,Almost certainly the last one. Only a psychopath would grow Auston Matthews moustache.
1062,2020-01-28 21:05:49,ev0n4d,"Think about it like baseball too, you throw with your dominant hand and catch with the other (usually) so why would a goalie be different and catch with their dominant hand? Not to mention like others have said, it takes more muscle to handle the stick and that’s why it should be in your dominant hand, you use your stick to push off or poke check, I wouldn’t leave that up to my weaker hand."

1066,2020-01-28 03:40:13,euzy5k,"[I'm not gay but I want to live in a log cabin in the woods with Jamie Benn. We won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand in the kitchen window watching him tighten his ass as he chops wood, shirtless, sweat pouring off his body. I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Jamie. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then he'll go inside, pen a brief missive to his departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without his one true platonic love.](https://i.imgur.com/b0SHN5U.jpg)"

Dallas winning a Cup in the near future would be awesome. Really any of the Southern teams winning would be great for hockey IMHO, grow the sport."
1112,2020-01-28 03:47:51,euzy5k,"I just want the game to grow and more people to be interested in it so we have more kids making it into the CHL, university, and the NHL from the South, and so the sport becomes more relevant. Would also be great to get more minorities interested in watching and playing the sport.

When Chicago won in 2010, my Filipino mom started watching more and became a fan. I know there's others like that out there and I just want this sport to include as many people."

1118,2020-01-28 04:03:30,euzy5k,You’re indeed correct

1121,2020-01-28 05:20:08,euzy5k,"Awesome! I've always had a soft spot for Columbus, that sweep last year was the second best moment of the season for me (first being in the barn when Klinger scored in game 6 ot vs the preds)."
1122,2020-01-28 03:50:20,euzy5k,Cost will always be a huge factor. I see more ice rinks now that I am in Dallas but the cost will be the largest hurdle. I too want to see the game grow.
1123,2020-01-28 04:18:13,euzy5k,Exactly. I prefer “Cerebral” though lol.
1124,2020-01-28 04:13:50,euzy5k,Tampa got sloppy there in the third for sure. Both of Benn's goals are preventable by being more careful with the puck.
1125,2020-01-28 04:57:39,euzy5k,DEEP IN THE HEART OF TEXAS
1126,2020-01-28 03:52:30,euzy5k,Tampa got really sloppy near the end. Janmark had a breakaway too. Gg tho man.
1127,2020-01-28 05:26:49,euzy5k,"Personally, I think the sweep is overblown by the majority of the Columbus fanbase and hockey fans in general. Was it cool? Yeah. Does it really mean anything more than 1st win in franchise history? No. Losing the next round means that the previous round was for nothing. Columbus fans continue to bring up said sweep even though it meant little. The Cup is what matters. Even second place is the first loser, which were the Bruins. 

(And personally I like Tampa and seeing them get swept was embarrassing for the sport. I want them to win a Cup soon, along with Dallas, Florida, Vegas, Carolina, and Nashville.)"
1128,2020-01-28 03:52:36,euzy5k,"Hispanics and Asians continue to grow in population in the States, getting those people interested in the game, even if they cannot play en masse, will be important. You can love game even if you never played, like myself."
1129,2020-01-28 03:53:47,euzy5k,"GG, yeah."
1130,2020-01-28 05:48:39,euzy5k,"I can appreciate that, and I know that the first round doesn't mean anything, but it was the best upset I've ever seen. I don't dislike Tampa either, but the emotions, man. I always wanted Columbus to get better, after the sweep I got a second team to jam to. If they were playing a back and forth series, I doubt I would have tuned in (I had to explain to my wife why we were watching Columbus when the Stars weren't playing So, even tho it wasn't a cup, it brings interest. It was a big deal to us. Bring more in the future."
1131,2020-01-28 03:54:34,euzy5k,"I am Hispanic and I love the game. I gave it a chance, watched a game live and was hooked instantly. I have never played but I want to learn. I will suck but it will be fun and I will get a good workout in."
1132,2020-01-28 03:56:40,euzy5k,"I'm half Asian from Indiana (basketball state) and only casually watched until my sophomore year of university. Wanted to start following hardcore and love it now. Love the Blackhawks and Blue Jackets. Love hockey overall, hope to get good enough at skating so I can play before turning 25."
1133,2020-01-28 05:38:29,euzy5k,"Hispanic fan as well. Got invited to a game a few years ago and I got hooked immediately. Stars won that game 5-0 against the Isles and I was going crazy with every goal. Now I've been to more Stars games than I have been to basketball, baseball, and football games COMBINED!"

1137,2020-01-27 12:49:21,eumlm8,I think rocks overpower literally everything. Except the immunity necklace if course
1138,2020-01-28 07:11:28,eumlm8,I think he has to play the idol after the tie is announced and he'd be a non-rock drawer.
1139,2020-01-27 21:20:46,eumlm8,Unplayed superidols do not protect from rocks.
1140,2020-01-27 21:51:43,eumlm8,YOU COULD FLUSH THE SUPER IDOL
1141,2020-01-27 15:36:06,eumlm8,"God, I love the rock draw as a mechanic of the game. Typically I’m not a big fan of RNG when it comes to Survivor but there’s something about going to rocks which is just so extreme that makes the entire process innately fascinating."
1142,2020-01-27 15:52:25,eumlm8,I kinda like the RNG nature of it because no one likes it.  Often just the threat of rocks forces someone to change.

1220,2020-01-26 22:09:20,eudgyb,"The thought was this: 

- Grammys are the popheads' Oscars/Superbowl/Etc. 

- Activity in the grammy threads are going to be high

- There isn't going to be an active Grammy thread involving awards starting at 5:30pm, and this will take only around an hour 

- A time after today is going to be less interesting with actual Grammys behind us, and a time earlier this weekend simply didn't work with my own schedule 

If people legitimately don't think this is a smart idea based on current upvotes, I will just announce the winners since I didn't get great reception last year either and that was on a Friday afternoon."

1229,2020-01-25 17:37:58,ettprd,"Wale is surprisingly high 

This list confirms quite a few stereotypes about the NBA lol

Also Damian Lillard follows Kellin Quinn, the lead singer of sleeping with sirens, so there’s a least a slight rock connection."

Also weird how Chance, Durk, Reese, Bibby, Chief Keef all have such strong showings. Is there that many players from Chicago?"
1243,2020-01-25 18:41:19,ettprd,NBA players have terrible tastes in music and so do all of you. I'll take my downvotes in peace now.

1379,2020-01-23 17:48:40,esv3xi,"I don't think it's weird when Korey has stated exactly why he likes the dude. He is an idol to him. A self-made man. Everyone calls him out for it, Korey just gets defensive because he is, in fact, biased toward Perry."
1380,2020-01-23 17:56:18,esv3xi,"I think there's a lot to be admired in Tyler Perry for the business he's created. I can see why Korey loves him, especially as a self made black man in an industry where, historically, black people have a harder time getting ahead. 

However he completely looks past the fact that as a filmmaker, Tyler Perry is incompetent and given his vast amount of clout and resources, that's pretty inexcusable. Martin even brought this point up during their A Fall From Grace review and Korey completely blew it off - that Tyler Perry actually gets worse at making movies, not better, and seemingly never learns anything. Maybe making money by rushing and cutting corners everywhere you can makes you a good business man, but an absolutely atrocious creative. It's strange that Korey seems incapable of recognizing that - I get the feeling that he doesn't want to put down the only black powerhouse in Hollywood, but will never say so because that goes against the narrative he's created around himself."
1381,2020-01-23 19:50:34,esv3xi,"As someone who who has seen every play and movie of Perry's while acknowledging their ""quality"", I'm not against Korey in regards to Tyler Perry. My thing is as long as he acknowledges that his movies arent good there no harm in liking in liking the dude."
1382,2020-01-23 19:34:17,esv3xi,"I should probably check out one of these Tyler Perry film some day.

Maybe.

Perhaps."
1383,2020-01-25 12:48:50,esv3xi,"It's cool that Korey can relate to a lot of Tyler Perry's successful qualities.

If he could also see how he almost perfectly relates to the bad qualities as well and fixes that, that would be great."
1384,2020-01-23 19:13:52,esv3xi,"Nah.

Perry makes black Cinema look foolish."
1385,2020-01-29 07:20:54,esv3xi,I just recently watched  the episode where he addressed this.  He said what he liked about him but also shit on all the stuff that was obviously crappy. Im not sure whats weird about this...
1386,2020-01-28 05:53:16,esv3xi,"He just respects him as businessman, plus his movies have his movies have made for a lot funny DT reviews"
1387,2020-01-23 18:22:49,esv3xi,"I really enjoyed Korey talking about how much he admired him for the empire Perry has built. Is it built on the backs of shit movies? Yeah, but it still made him fairly wealthy and he's seemingly living a good life and having a good time."
1388,2020-01-23 21:34:16,esv3xi,Was Korey/Martin aware of Tyler Perry showing off all of his finished scripts on Twitter and people raking him over the coals about it? If he doesn't allow anyone in his writers room to flourish but himself (And his writing is always super bad over the top) then he just maintains the same level of insanity. And Boo! was the turning point where he got to his laziness.
1389,2020-01-23 18:21:34,esv3xi,He knows what he does. Tyler is still a respectable dude.
1390,2020-01-23 11:35:39,esn1gh,"I can go with that, Probably the best songs on the album to be honest"
1391,2020-01-23 16:49:58,esn1gh,"I don't mind 'fat' on the album. As long as there are songs I like, I'm happy. I don't care if a restaurant's menu has 10 items or 500 items as long as there's something I want to order. MFAD is basically a representation of their whole career, from simple blues-based rockers (Oh Yeah, Something) to more sleazy rock (Out Go The Lights) to well-made ballads (Another Last Goodbye) to radio fluff (We All Fall Down). I just personally don't feel that removing songs makes the remaining ones better, so I wouldn't remove any.

I don't think including older tracks is cheating. Sometimes songs that don't make the cut are still good. For example, 'Guilty Kilt' was a widely known Pump outtake (among hardcore fans, at least) that the band actually played live a few times over the years. Clearly they liked it. And they finally had the time to work it up into Out Go The Lights."
1392,2020-01-25 20:56:12,esn1gh,"Seems good. Could take either Up On The Mountain or Freedom Fighter IMO, as a switch from Steven as the main singer."
1393,2020-01-27 01:12:38,esn1gh,Best songs on the album. I've never understood the hate for this album.
1394,2020-01-23 21:08:17,esn1gh,">I just personally don't feel that removing songs makes the remaining ones better, so I wouldn't remove any.

I mean, it's an album, not a compilation. It makes listening to the album as a whole more entertaining. Would you rather have a buffet where every other item is burnt or one with less stuff but everything tastes good?"
1395,2020-01-23 23:26:29,esn1gh,"Doesn't really matter to me, the way I personally think about it. 

Let's say, for example, that I only like 9 of the 15 songs on MFAD.

Universe 1: Aerosmith puts out a bloated MFAD with 15 songs, 9 of which I like.  
Universe 2: Aerosmith puts out a stripped down MFAD with 9 songs, 9 of which I like.

The end result in either case is that they put out a product that gave me 9 new songs to enjoy, so it doesn't matter to me. *But*, having more songs means that someone with a slightly different musical taste has a better chance of liking more Aerosmith (maybe the 9 you like is different than the 9 I like), so having many songs appeals to both the blues-based fans from the 70s-80s (Street Jesus, Oh Yeah, Something) and the pop-based fans from the 90s-00s (Beautiful, Can't Stop Lovin' You, We All Fall Down)."

1496,2020-03-25 20:35:01,forxz1,"Joe Nichols was more 00s, he happened to have a brief resurgence with ""Sunny And 75"" and ""Yeah"".

Chris Cagle's heyday was also the 00s, his last Top 5 was ""What Kinda Gone?"" in 2008. He actually retired in 2015.

Jerrod Neimann and The Band Perry kamakazied their own careers with ""Donkey"" and ""Live Forever"" respectively. 

I'd add Steel Magnolia and Greg Bates to that list"

I loved Frankie's records, so sad radio dropped him, he's such a solid guitarist. 

Joe Nichols had a solid career compared to rest of this list. 

Easton was billed as the next George Strait at one point.... really enjoyed his first record.

Cam and Band Perry will be the greatest 1 hit wonders of the era.

Thompson Square was just a reason for David Lee Murphy to score more #1's by writing duets.

The rest were... doomed to not last. that's the business."

 Easton has kind of hung around for sure. he had a song called 'clockwork' if i remember right that was really good. 

I am surprised Perry had 4 #1s. I remember hearing them for a few years but it got bad fast, some song about a chainsaw? A decade from now noone will remember anything but 'if i die young' which is a classic.

thanks for the stats"

1509,2020-03-24 14:57:52,fo6dwl,People are in favor of communities in movies. So any movie with real communities and ones built with accurate racial depictions and not token diversity feels more Real and people will relate to it more and like it
1510,2020-03-24 15:12:58,fo6dwl,"I think the good ones shine through and are popular worldwide. I mean, I consider Friday an all time classic comedy movie. And I’m a white guy here in the uk."
1511,2020-03-24 15:00:09,fo6dwl,"Feels like more. Back when theaters were opened, I had inadvertantly started a Black Movie Sunday. It happend after I saw *Just Mercy*, *Slim* and *Bad Boys for Life* on consecutive Sundays so it certainly seems like African-Americans have more box office representation than ever before."
1512,2020-03-24 15:28:00,fo6dwl,"There are more because more opportunities for African American directors and writers to their thing. Also because of this, there are more roles for African-American actors and actresses compared to like 25-30 years ago. Also on that it is becoming more mainstream because times have changed for the better"
1513,2020-03-24 19:13:23,fo6dwl,"I don't care about the race/ethnicity of the actors.

But a common theme I saw in most old black-majority films was blaxsploitation,  reinforcing stereotypes either in a negative or comedic light (but not like good comedy, but like overused momma/fat/blonde jokes), or a focus on racism or slavery. And if not that, it was some Lifetime movie-like family/faith drama.

Like, you can only enjoy so many films like that. Similar issues in LGBT films - so many end, even in these times, bittersweet or tragic. Why the hell can't we have HAPPY LGBT films? Where's our Zack Effron/Zandaya forbidden-love-ends-happy gay couple? 

That's why films like *Black Panther,* *Creed,* and *Us* are great. Even *Get Out*, which does play on our experiences with race/racism, isn't doing so in the same way as Blaxploitation films in the past. It doesn't, like, *glorify* being the downtrodden race, if that makes sense. Like there's something ""good"" about being the victims. 

So the key for any under-represented (or badly represented) demographic to making films that are more relatable and appealing to the masses is to just make the films that present the obstacles and challenges the characters face as something not entirely unique to their own race/ethnicity/sexuality. Like if say, *The Devil Wears Prada* was led by a Black woman. You can bring up systemic racism in the fashion world as something Black-Andy has to navigate and overcome just as White-Andy had to navigate and overcome systemic sexism at certain points, but if every single challenge she faced *was* about racism, that would be just as tedious as White-Andy having to tackle sexism in every single challenge. Did Tyrion Lannister encounter problems related to being a dwarf? Yes. Were ALL his problems and relatable issues related to being a dwarf? No."
1514,2020-03-24 21:21:07,fo6dwl,"Less Madea, Green Book, and Moonlight. More *Inside Man*, and *Tenet*."
1515,2020-03-24 15:27:23,fo6dwl,"I think it has more to do with the changing of the gatekeepers. If some talented young actors in the 1950s were black, there weren't films being greenlit that they could star in. 

Over the last 30 years the people who greenlight films have become Gen X and Millennials. They saw no reason to gatekeep filmmaking to prevent black, LGBTQ, women and any other underrepresented groups from being part of the industry. 

This goes for much art: video games, TV, books, stage acting, etc. The actors and stories have always been there. They just haven't been allowed to be produced until recently."
1516,2020-03-24 15:38:59,fo6dwl,"And more importantly, stories *generated* from those *within* the community are, naturally, more relatable. When filmmakers like Jordan Peele, Barry Jenkins, Ava DuVernay, Ryan Coogler, and Dee Rees write their stories, they resonate with us because they are us.

And this isn't just happening within black cinema. I'd argue that films like Burning, The Farewell, Crazy Rich Asians, and this year's Sundance grand jury winner Minari are reflective of how stories from Asian perspectives can resonate.

Parasite winning Best Picture's a testament to the strengths of writing what you know. Moonlight winning two years prior was another."
1517,2020-03-24 22:36:35,fo6dwl,moonlight was wonderful
1518,2020-03-24 15:50:17,fo6dwl,"Yes even Knives Out is a predominately white movie which is on reason why it was successful. It was built on a community aspect. I think there's two kinds of thinking with diversity. The majority of places in the world have one or two races as a majority. But then you have kind of coastal port places like New York and California that is built on immigrating as many people as possible and take all the cast offs. You can see the massive difference between how people view diversity based on community vs individual character tokenism. It all depends on if people support the coastal tokenism diversity or the other parts of the country diversity where it's more homegrown.

I have a hard time not seeing a writer or casting agent in my head when I see a cast where every single person is a different background. That rings so false to me. there is almost always a majority of someone, and that's good. It means we have diversity in the world that we can explore

Like I'll give an example of a horrible use of diversity. The new Beauty and the Beast. The whole point of the town is that it is so small that Belle has to sing about how small it is. Yet these people that apparently are so bigoted have black librarians and interracial marriages and all this stuff and even allow women to be in mobs. You are actively hurting your own movie when you say one thing then cast for another"

>But then you have kind of coastal port places like New York and California that is built on immigrating as many people as possible and **take all the cast offs**. 

Hmmm.....

>It all depends on if people support the coastal tokenism diversity or the other parts of the country diversity where it's more homegrown.

Ahh, so this is some sort of *coastal* agenda, which isn't reflective of the *true*... *homegrown*... ""diversity""... which is...

> The whole point of the town is that it is so small that Belle has to sing about how small it is. Yet these people that apparently are so bigoted have black librarians and interracial marriages and all this stuff and even allow women to be in mobs.

You seem to suffer from a certain... binary, dogmatic, fundamentalist mode of thought, which you are then applying to artistic interpretation. I think that's why you have the most outlandish perspective.


But I think I see your greater racial arguments in regards to diversity (it's hard looking at minorities right?). I certainly know where they're coming from... spectrum-wise. I think, overall, you've got a pretty reductive take on things, but you at least *sound* better than most of the people who incessantly bitch about diversity in film.

Also, you should watch Knives Out again as a commentary on people who make similar arguments as you. There's actually literally a scene in the film of people lampooning your ideology. It's so funny actually... the irony of it... that you saw Knives Out as a predominantly white film, when it's like... super critical of the white race. That's... damn I love art."
1521,2020-03-24 16:55:11,fo6dwl,"I'm a minority I see minorities everyday in the mirror bro. And I'm agreeing with you. Stories about communities are more real than Hollywood plopping every demographic, focus tested character groups together to cover as wide a net as possible.

Knives out was a critique of white people, which is fine. But like if the entire family was multiracial the whole movie would lose its message. Nobody hates white people more than other white people. It's funny to watch from the outside to me. It's similar to Parasite, or Black Panther. If you're going to make a movie about a subject you have to cast the right people for it.

>You seem to suffer from a certain... binary, dogmatic, fundamentalist mode of thought, which you are then applying to artistic interpretation. I think that's why you have the most outlandish perspective.


I tried genuinely. I have no clue what this even means."

That's exactly what they are saying. It's very much a white people movie."
1523,2020-03-24 17:38:38,fo6dwl,"> But like if the entire family was multiracial the whole movie would lose its message. 

Sure, but... the white cast *was* the message. Since you're a minority, you'll remember the uproar at the Hamilton casting notes as they were looking for minorities like *ourselves* to play the main characters, save for King George, played brilliant by Jonathan Groff. There was so much anger and threats of boycotting from people who bristle at diversity, or see it as some cinematically illogical threat that rips them away from their precious art.

>I tried genuinely. I have no clue what this even means.

I've clearly made presumptions of you. My bad.

Good talk though... good ideas at play here."
1524,2020-03-24 18:51:33,fo6dwl,"I know nothing about Hamilton. I'm not a Broadway dude. Was King George the bad guy? If so I get the anger. But either way I genuinely don't know what the Broadway crowd likes and I know it's a success for them, good for them.

Yeah man you're good at talking about this stuff. Cheers."
1525,2020-03-24 19:10:52,fo6dwl,"Whether King George was a bad guy is up to one's perspective. He was a historical figure who, I assume, thought he was doing the right thing. Americans, however, might disagree if they value their freedom.

In the play though he's a riot! One of the most beloved characters in musicals ever, honestly. It's an incredible role that actors are dying to play, so they had no context for their anger, if that makes sense."
1526,2020-03-24 16:57:33,fo6csp,"All depends on whether this film is marketable to a worldwide audience. Us made a healthy amount last year from overseas box office, though not as much as domestic. Black Panther had a single white supporting character and did very well overseas though that is likely the exception not the rule."
1527,2020-03-24 19:39:06,fo6csp,"I'd distinguish between ""black-led"" and ""black films."" The first is more about star power and how fewer black actors have broken through to that level; in today's climate, if ""Mission: Impossible"" had been built around Will Smith or Idris Elba instead of Tom Cruise, but otherwise identical, I imagine it would be similarly successful. But that's more about open casting.

""Black films"" meaning films with themes relevant to African-American communities or history, I'd say just face that same hill as any other film trying to break out of a niche - the more accessible and relevant to mainstream audiences, the less dialed-in to the niche audience it can be. 'Slumdog Millionaire' could not have been targeted to an Indian audience without sacrificing how accessible or relevant it would be to a broad, mainstream audience. For films centered on black history in America, i.e. slavery, it's important not to get the details wrong too - similar to what religious-themed films deal with, dogma outweighs plot considerations.

ETA: For films like 'Us', I imagine that broad audiences are enjoying the film on one level (making for a successful global release) and African-American audiences enjoying it on two or three levels with more insight into the themes, situations, visuals (being chained while under threat, for example).

tl:dr; The more mainstream you make a film the less 'black' it is by definition"

His films don't target the black demographic, They target the black American demographic, I don't think his films would be enjoyed by anybody outside the US, Including black people. Black comedy films used to appeal to more people. 

I think lot's of black films today target the US audience, It seems most black-lead films now are all about race, which is a bigger problem in the US.

I think black people are getting picked as leads more now, when 30 years ago they probably would have been a side character. 

If black lead films want to be more successful, they have to stop making the same films which appeals more to the US population, Stop making the same slave film, or the same cops hate black man film."
1529,2020-03-24 16:50:36,fo6csp,i actually believe that studios and distributors are still afraid to put out the smaller Black-led movies worldwide. there is a reason why most of them don't get the theatrical run outside of the US and select countries.

1531,2020-03-24 21:14:04,fo6csp,I dislike recent black-led movies because they overemphasize the black experience aspect and that is alienating and boring to me personally. I'm sure others feel the same.

but there are a lot of Black-led movies which aren't about slavery or police vs. Black people. just from the recent movies, there were The Photograph, WAVES, The Last Black Man In Francisco, Bad Boys 3, Little, Us, High Flying Bird, Shaft... they all are about different things."

1538,2020-03-24 23:01:38,fo6csp,"for example, Boots Riley mentioned once that international distributors were afraid of purchasing Sorry To Bother You bc it was a Black movie. This movie barely was released outside of the US. I can imagine that it happened more than once."

1541,2020-03-23 05:24:58,fneg10,"Why would the Hawks ever draft LaMelo

Also Toppin and Jalen Smith are too low, Toppin will go top-10 and Jalen Smith will go top-20"
1542,2020-03-23 05:27:27,fneg10,I am a Wizards fan and not high on RJ Hampton. Also curious about what you all think about Deni Avdija going 3.
1543,2020-03-23 06:15:35,fneg10,can someone explain what Okoro's role will be in the NBA?
1544,2020-03-23 07:29:17,fneg10,I don’t think the Hawks would draft a PG
1545,2020-03-23 12:09:17,fneg10,"The Kings are going to resign Bogi in the off-season. That leaves a guard rotation of Fox, Bogi, Buddy, and Joseph. They aren't going to draft Maxey. A wing defender in Vassell or a high risk high reward McDaniels would seem to make more sense. I wouldn't be surprised to see them trade down either but Maxey makes very little sense to me"
1546,2020-03-23 19:31:42,fneg10,"not a big deal because of the lack of ball recently, but this mock is from the 8th, right? i'd expect a slightly modified one soon."
1547,2020-03-23 07:13:56,fneg10,Rather get Bolmaro then Bey but I would live with this
1548,2020-03-23 06:54:13,fneg10,"I hope Wiseman ends up at GSW. I know he might not be the top prospect and it's all about BPA and all that jazz but they don't really have anyone else to trade to get a good center, nor do they have cap space. I'd just get Wiseman to plug the hole"
1549,2020-03-23 06:37:37,fneg10,Can Obi play the 5?
1550,2020-03-23 18:11:48,fneg10,Can people stop taking tankathon seriously? Isn’t the person that runs it a self-admitted casual? Y’all shouldn’t take my mocks drafts too seriously so why take his?
1551,2020-03-23 18:25:44,fneg10,Their mocks aren’t good. Reggie Perry as a first is hilarious

As a Wolves fan I really like Deni at 3 for us."
1553,2020-03-23 05:56:34,fneg10,Please God don’t let ant edwards end up in Cleveland...the land where young talent slowly but surely dies
1554,2020-03-23 08:43:06,fneg10,He’s an idiot.  Precious Achiuwa in the 30s 🤣
1555,2020-03-23 05:23:31,fneg10,I think Timberwolves trade down for Toppin and pick up a first rounder for next year.
1556,2020-03-23 19:29:00,fneg10,Great draft for the Knicks
1557,2020-03-24 03:01:40,fneg10,Toppin on the Spurs? Interesting.
1558,2020-03-23 06:44:02,fneg10,Tyrese to the Knicks hurts my soul.
1559,2020-03-23 06:51:26,fneg10,"Onyeka Okongwu vs Obi Topping.
Can Obi play the 5?"
1560,2020-03-23 20:49:15,fneg10,"I don’t see the Warriors drafting Wiseman. His only proven skill is blocking shots. He has no post game and no reliable shot. 

Edwards, on the other hand, is an NBA ready player. He has an NBA body, an explosive move to the hoop, and a sweet jump shot. Based on his size, skills and athleticism, he’s the best player in the draft and there’s not a close second.

On the downside, during his one season in Georgia he took too many bad shots and was often indifferent on defense.

If the Warriors can bring the best out of him on a consistent basis, he could be a special player."
1561,2020-03-24 02:55:13,fneg10,"There's something called Euro-virus that infects all draft site owners and makes them think that Brooklyn will draft obscure Euro players every time, lol.
Hello, Prokhorov sold the team to Chinese guy!"
1562,2020-03-23 05:44:52,fneg10,I mean who should the Hawks take if Deni / Wiseman / Ant are off the board?  Okongwu and hope he can play C?  Maybe they trade the pick but Tankathon isn't accounting for that
1563,2020-03-23 11:26:38,fneg10,I hope the hawks ll trade the pick. For other picks or some good player ready to play
1564,2020-03-24 00:26:34,fneg10,In this scenario he would clearly be the BPA and LaMelo would be the best asset to trade.
1565,2020-03-24 06:53:18,fneg10,Ihu guarantee if the hawks pick lamelo he will hold out what kind of pick is that . Literally the worse type of player to put next trae. Ball dominant guard with a iffy shot and they both don’t play defense
1566,2020-03-23 16:41:23,fneg10,I'd love him in Minnesota tbh
1567,2020-03-24 16:55:32,fneg10,Deni has been scouted by us since the season. Strong contention to be the selection.
1568,2020-03-23 07:06:05,fneg10,Think people see him as an elite defender who can develop a shot and turn into an x-factor. Offensively he hasn’t shown anything that indicates that but I understand if teams believe in him expanding his game.
1569,2020-03-23 12:52:29,fneg10,"I think teams will look at him in a similar vein to Marcus smart. His percentages aren’t great from three but he’s a solid finisher and has shown some confidence taking step back threes. May be a little while, but I think his shooting will come around."
1570,2020-03-23 06:45:52,fneg10,Want to hear thoughts on this as well.
1571,2020-03-23 07:14:49,fneg10,1-4 elite defender (on and off ball) on defense and slasher on offense in theory
1572,2020-03-23 11:24:41,fneg10,In my opinion I see a late career Andre Iguodala as his median outcome
1573,2020-03-23 21:53:51,fneg10,80% of Andre Iguodala
1574,2020-03-23 09:48:14,fneg10,"The essence of what makes him special is being able to play above the rim as an undersized forward. So to me , Okoro’s best role is as a playmaking small ball 4 who defends multiple positions."
1575,2020-03-24 03:28:24,fneg10,OG 2.0?
1576,2020-03-26 03:04:21,fneg10,I read somewhere on twitter from a sports writer that Vlades really been scouting Aleksej Pokuševski. IMO he’d be a really good fit next to Bagley.
1577,2020-03-24 20:53:40,fneg10,what changed since the 8th?
1578,2020-03-23 22:20:28,fneg10,Yeah take Bolmaro so Saddiq can fall to the Raps please
1579,2020-03-23 11:31:43,fneg10,"As a Warriors fan I truly hope this doesn’t happen. They can get a center for the biannual exception, MLE, or even the minimum who can do at least 75% of what wiseman can do. If they can get a bruising center to complement Chriss/Bender/Looney, I’d be happy. I think picking a guard or wing would make a lot more sense."
1580,2020-03-23 21:38:31,fneg10,"outside of blocking shots, what special ability has Wiseman demonstrated that justifies the No. 1 pick?"
1581,2020-03-23 21:55:27,fneg10,Draymond green is our center to close games... we can get any combination of vet min players to fill minutes here and there. Wiseman isn’t really as great of a fit in terms of asset allocation as it initially seems.
1582,2020-03-23 14:41:28,fneg10,The  more I think about it the more I like Toppin to the Warriors. Hes a much  better offensive player than Wiseman and would thrive in their floor spacing. He is a prospect who will be able to play right away and contribute.
1583,2020-03-23 20:15:02,fneg10,"> Y’all shouldn’t take my mocks drafts too seriously so why take his?

Something to talk about with sports being shut down and a lot of people in quarantine/social-distancing"
1584,2020-03-23 20:06:54,fneg10,Sexton has been playing pretty well lately
1585,2020-03-24 21:54:22,fneg10,"That log jam of shot creating, scoring guards on the Cavs is going to get really ugly. Plus KPJ and Edwards play similar roles in offenses"
1586,2020-03-24 01:06:45,fneg10,I'd take precious over Isaiah stewart. Basically same player except precious is more of a freak athlete
1587,2020-03-23 06:45:44,fneg10,Who would trade up though?
1588,2020-03-23 07:14:18,fneg10,It's definitely the best pick here for us
1589,2020-03-23 11:32:53,fneg10,Give me Okongwu. Toppin isn’t good enough defensively to play the 5 in my opinion
1590,2020-03-24 07:01:39,fneg10,Poku makes sense though and isn't that wierd
1591,2020-03-23 07:10:16,fneg10,"Hail fits Trae really well and means they won't be married to Huerter and could move Cam to SF more. 

Okongwu isn't bad either"
1592,2020-03-23 06:05:18,fneg10,"Hayes would be a better fit than LaMelo. He looks like he could operate better off ball than LaMelo could at the very least as we all know Trae isn’t coming off of it anytime soon. Could also do Okoro as we suck ass at defense, and maaaybee OO but that’s kind of a stretch if they think Collins will be here long term."
1593,2020-03-23 06:04:31,fneg10,"Literally anyone else lol

If I were them I’d take Okongwu, Okoro, Toppin, Hayes, hell even Cole Anthony over LaMelo

Like yeah I get offense is generally more valuable than defense when compared straight up, but Trae and LaMelo would be by far the worst defensive backcourt in NBA history

In a vacuum LaMelo probably has the highest ceiling of all those guys, but I can easily see him being a complete bust, and there’s no need for the Hawks to take that huge risk, especially on a ball dominant high volume low efficiency shooter who by all accounts plays absolutely zero defense

Really he’s only projected so high because people think “damn what if Lonzo was a little bit taller and could shoot” but from what I’ve seen they’re not all that comparable"
1594,2020-03-24 02:29:46,fneg10,"I obviously don’t agree he’s best player available.  But best player to trade is interesting.  Because if a team is high on him, like I’d assume Portland, Detroit and Sacramento are, you could get quite a bit.  The problem is, I imagine there are a lot of teams very low on him, so if those teams don’t give you what you want, you could be stuck with him.   And if I’m Atlanta, the last thing I would want is to be stuck with another young player, when they should really be eying the playoffs next year."
1595,2020-03-23 13:39:10,fneg10,"Do people really think his defense is that much better than Vassell's, Bey's, or other 3+D guys to the point where it compensates for his shooting? I personally see Okoro ""falling"" and going somewhere in the 20s and some of the guys like Vassell, Bey and Nesmith (if he continues to light it up in workouts) jumping ahead of him. Depends on the team as well though. Maybe somebody has shooting and feels like they just need a lockdown guard with quick feet to specialize on D."
1596,2020-03-23 08:24:07,fneg10,I feel like there can only be 1 non-shooter at all times on the floor who contributes by either rim running or playmaking. The Andre Roberson or Tony Allen type seam to be going extinct. Does he have good mechanics? Is there a shot in his future?
1597,2020-03-24 22:11:10,fneg10,"there were a few games played before the season was called on the 12th. Euros, i think, were cancelled the same day. not much activity, but i'd still expect some movement coming up."
1598,2020-03-23 23:18:12,fneg10,"Don’t see any way that happens tbh.  Big 3&D wings like Bey are overvalued now, the days of a prospect like Anunoby slipping in the draft are gone .

Honestly I could see teams in the top 12 talking themselves into Bey. He’s very safe prospect and went to a respected program, that’s the type of player who will rise up boards this year when there’s so little info available on the sleeper prospects."
1599,2020-03-23 23:03:08,fneg10,Better for both of us
1600,2020-03-23 21:47:21,fneg10,"It’s obviously not a normal draft year so there won’t be a conventional #1 pick. If Wiseman projects to be a massive rim protector who can run the floor, set screens and hit jumpers (I’m not talking about creating his own offense, but developing a PnP game like Myles Turner isn’t out of the question for JW) then he can add great value to any team. Even moreso GSW who have an exceptional amount of spacing and the playmakers to help Wiseman develop."
1601,2020-03-23 21:51:58,fneg10,which is probably more reason for them to not want edwards lol
1602,2020-03-23 22:48:33,fneg10,"Sexton is a beast. I was more inferring that Cleveland is such a shit franchise that no matter how much young talent they get it really doesn’t make a difference, they’ll find a way to fuck things up. Would love to see Edwards end up in Phoenix with booker, that would be a dangerous wing duo"
1603,2020-03-24 01:26:03,fneg10,Not to mention he can guard 5 positions while giving you 15 boards
1604,2020-03-23 16:10:54,fneg10,Knicks or Detroit. Especially if Lamelo is still available. They both need a franchise player so I can see them trading to try and get one.
1605,2020-03-23 20:16:44,fneg10,"If the board falls exactly like this, would you be willing to trade up with the Cavs to get Ball or Edwards? How much would you be willing to give up?"
1606,2020-03-23 08:19:03,fneg10,"yea 

i like defense"
1607,2020-03-23 18:51:32,fneg10,I feel like Toppin is overated. He’s also 22
1608,2020-03-23 06:51:43,fneg10,"I think taking Okoro at 4 is a massive overdraft even in this current class.  Hayes is probably a little better as a fit but I think if you're playing him off ball he's not gonna give you 4th pick value either, at that point you should be looking to trade as they assumedly would with Lamelo.  Ultimately I'd assume ATL would just go BPA and look to make a deal so whether you think Hayes or Melo is the better prospect determines who's going in that slot, I'm personally pretty split between the two.  I think a trade up to get Edwards from Cleveland could be interesting for both teams if the draft plays out exactly like this"
1609,2020-03-23 14:26:34,fneg10,"Melo is a lot better than Lonzo in the half-court, and has a lot more moves to break down a defense. Lonzo is also a much better defender and doesn't need the ball in his hands nearly as much as Melo does. They aren't that similar players if we're being honest. 

Really, the people that are comparing him to his brother are just being lazy, like when European bigs who can shoot are automatically compared to Dirk."
1610,2020-03-23 13:35:36,fneg10,"Lol. That is not why lamely is projected high. There is a good argument he is the best player in this draft (though I would personally take 1-2 people over him). ATL could reach for Okoro or okongwu...Logically, I could see them trading down 2 spots with the Knicks. But if no trade happens, Lamelo is the best player on the board. Not just higher ceiling, he's a better player right now than any of the other guys. His abilities might not fit which is the most logical argument for ATL passing on him."
1611,2020-03-23 13:39:42,fneg10,Maybe mid-low teens considering this draft
1612,2020-03-23 21:50:32,fneg10,"He's the kind of high character guy that Garpax will probably pick, maybe they think he's Jimmy Buckets 2.0 on the basis of trying really hard"
1613,2020-03-24 22:42:58,fneg10,"It will be interesting to see how this process plays out. Normally, we’d have some information from the combine and team workouts and evaluations. Those appear to be in jeopardy, so evaluating and projecting the draft might be challenging"
1614,2020-03-23 23:23:25,fneg10,"There’s always a couple players that fall every year for no explainable reason

Plus I don’t really see any other good 3/4’s in the late 20’s that the Raptors could go for so I’m hoping that’s the case with Bey 😅"
1615,2020-03-23 22:16:08,fneg10,"Shot blocking is a commodity in the NBA and not a skill that should determine the No. 1 pick. Everything else about Wiseman is potential. He doesn’t have any offensive skills yet that will translate to the NBA and he can’t defend on the perimeter. He bites on pump fakes way too easily. He’s a project who might develop in time, but it would be a long wait.

I’d argue that Anthony Edwards is more NBA ready than Wiseman and is a natural scorer. He would be a poor fit for a team that needs a No. 1 scorer, but on the Warriors he’d be the 4th option behind Curry, Thompson and Wiggins. And as a slasher with a good jump shot, he could boost the bench short term and work his way into the rotation relatively quickly. And he’ll be 19 when the 2020/21 season starts."
1616,2020-03-23 22:05:58,fneg10,Yeah it's a rough draft to be a bad team with a young core consisting entirely of guards
1617,2020-03-24 17:34:25,fneg10,"Cavs just get picked apart because they have LeBron. Minny, Atlanta, Detroit, Chicago, Phoenix, and Orlando are all just as good as being awful"
1618,2020-03-24 00:22:22,fneg10,They would give up next year's much more valuable pick? I highly doubt that.
1619,2020-03-23 19:24:13,fneg10,Gross
1620,2020-03-23 20:32:20,fneg10,"Not really for either. Not confident enough in anyone to waste other assets. Rather just rock Hail here.

Maybe a Mavs first for Edwards but unsure. I think y'all would be better off keeping Edwards"
1621,2020-03-24 06:57:37,fneg10,Yes our pick and the clippers pick to move up for a second and your 1st this year
1622,2020-03-24 00:50:48,fneg10,"If anything I think he's underrated. He's a Uber athletic 4 man who can pick and pop, shoot 3's and make dynamic plays off the dribble for himself or others. Defensively he will struggle guarding NBA 3's but I don't think he will be hopeless against 4's."
1623,2020-03-23 20:00:25,fneg10,"> I think a trade up to get Edwards from Cleveland could be interesting

What do you propose that Atlanta could give up in this scenario? I want Cleveland to trade down if we get a top three pick, but the only option that stands out to me is trading back with New York depending on how the lottery goes because they have the Clippers first, the Hornets second, and some other assets. I don't see Atlanta giving up a future first in a likely better class to move up for Edwards."
1624,2020-03-24 00:27:06,fneg10,Well there’s Tyler Bey who would be a great fit with the Raps as well.   He fits the OG Anunoby role but obviously older and not as heralded a prospect. He’s definitely more likely to be available where you guys are picking
1625,2020-03-23 22:44:26,fneg10,"Never said anything about shotblocking. Wiseman has the perfect profile to be a player who can take away shots at the rim in a drop defensive scheme. Being able to shut down the paint is incredibly valuable , it’s not just the shots you block but also the ones you deter the opponent from even taking. 

Rudy Gobert only logs ~2 blocked shots per game, but he has an impact on every single possession whether it’s recorded in the stat sheet or not. That’s why he’s been voted as DPOY. Wiseman has similar tools but is better prospect than Gobert was at 19, and has more potential to shoot the ball offensively so it’s pretty easy to make a case for him in this draft. 

I personally have Edwards #1 but it wouldn’t surprise me if Wiseman goes 1st due to his aforementioned potential. I don’t think any of these prospects are a home run"
1626,2020-03-25 00:43:53,fneg10,"At least Minnesota, ATL, CHI, Phoenix and Orlando have pieces to work with. Cavs have next to nothing along with a horrible owner and a bunch of players who don’t even wanna be there."
1627,2020-03-24 01:27:34,fneg10,Doesn’t have to be unprotected
1628,2020-03-24 17:47:40,fneg10,"Using the Atlanta trade up for DeAndre Hunter as a reference (8, 17, 35, and a protected 2020 first that will probably turn into two seconds for 4, 57, and a conditional 2023 second) I think it will probably take more from New York to move up to #2 from #6."
1629,2020-03-24 01:08:58,fneg10,"I don't think he'll be guarding 3's. He'll be guarding 4's or he'll play a lot of small ball 5. As athletic as he is, he'll need to def get quicker on his feet and get the grown man strength in the mix. At the very least one or the other so he can figure it out defensively."
1630,2020-03-23 21:38:07,fneg10,"Well if ATL is high enough on Edwards that they'd trade up (again, speculating) that means they probably want to dump one of their other wings to make room.  I'd assume somebody out of Reddish/Huerter/Hunter would be a decent incentive depending on who Cleveland likes out of the bunch.  Cleveland probably wants a 3-D guy given their roster construction, and Melo gives them a legit playmaker.  I have trouble imagining Edwards is a good fit for them if they're moving forward with Sexton as a lead scorer"
1631,2020-03-24 00:32:19,fneg10,"My concern with Tyler is his less complete offensive game but I like him too. I also like Patrick Williams (if they wanted more of a project)and Nesmith but they’re both likely gone by 28 too.

The Raps could also go for someone like Oturu given they need youth at the 5. Or Kira Lewis, but I think they’ll wait until next year before looking for their next PG."
1632,2020-03-23 23:11:28,fneg10,"I agree. There's no clear choice No. 1 pick in this draft. 

Any team that drafts Wiseman, however, will likely have a long wait for him to develop. His rookie NBA season will be the equivalent of his freshman year in college, and he and his team still have to figure out what kind of player he is.

Is he a post center? Is he a stretch 4 or 5?

In either case, he doesn't have any back to the basket moves or a perimeter shot that will translate to the NBA, at least not yet.

And although he can block shots, he hasn't demonstrated the ability to bang with large NBA bodies in the paint or defend the perimeter.

He might be the next Giannis, who was drafted relatively late in 2013 or he might not.

In any case, he's more of a project than Edwards, IMO. Edwards has warts, no doubt about it, but he knows who he is as a player and has scoring skills that should translate to the NBA"
1633,2020-03-25 00:51:23,fneg10,"I mean Sexton is an objectively nice piece, Kevin Porter Junior is the best kept secret in the league, and they’re going to have massive cap space this summer and the next. Also have a decent haul of picks. I’d rather be them than Minny, Chicago, and Orlando. KAT and D-Lo are gone and Minny has to overpay Beasley soon. Chicago with GarPax is awful and Orlando has to pay Issac, Fultz, Bamba in the coming years and they have Okeke and a another non-lottery pick coming down the drain. 

Gilbert is bad, but they have flexibility"
1634,2020-03-24 01:22:50,fneg10,"Yeah I am not sure Bey is an NBA caliber offensive player either , just that for where the Raps are picking he’s an option. And they’ve had more success with those types of players than most teams. 

If you guys don’t bring back Ibaka/Gasol, then Oturu or Xavier Tillman could be young options at the 5"
1635,2020-03-24 00:31:18,fneg10,"I think the teams who are drafting him to be their #1 option (which would
be absolutely stupid) will have to wait cause that ain’t happening any time soon. 

For a team with experienced guard play - like say GSW, Washington.. I do feel Wiseman would more or less hit the ground running. His flaws won’t be as pronounced if he has good playmaking and spacing around him . Just tell him to grab rebounds and sprint in the general direction of the basket, as long as he can catch a pass Steph will make the game easy for him. Or playing with a guard like Bradley Beal who gets double and triple-teamed , Wiseman will have 5 open dunks per game. Once he starts hitting trailer threes (and I don’t doubt GSW can improve his  shot) you have yourself a stronger Myles Turner. 

IMO Edwards is much more of a project as of now. He has to actually learn the nuances of elite guard/wing play whereas Wiseman can have an impact just from being big and running the floor. But the long term pay off with Ant could be much higher."
1636,2020-03-24 02:45:37,fneg10,My ideal draft is Saddiq Bey at 28 and then Neemias Queta at 58. If that doesn't happen though I'd like to get Oturu and then whoever BPA is in the second.
1637,2020-03-24 03:53:45,fneg10,"you might be right. I don't have a crystal ball

But I'm not sure that Wiseman gives you much more than Chriss or JaVale McGhee

Giannis would be his ultimate ceiling, and he could get there, but who knows.

Edwards is a natural scorer and no team, even the Warriors, can have too many of those"

I’m pretty sure there are some scouts/executives that are so sold on Jeudy with his refined route-running ability that they do consider him quite possibly the top player in the draft, while some may not even believe him to be WR1. 

What you produced brings a mesh of the many minds that take interest in this community and allowed for everyone’s voice to be heard at an equal level. 

Thank you, again. And I hope all is well with you as we all across the NFL Draft community can appreciate the content provided pertaining to the subject at hand, specifically during this time in the world in which we all have been affected to one degree or another."

Guys like WR JoJo Ward from Hawaii, SS/LB Patrick Nelson from SMU (he's got STs ace written all over him, and SS/LB hybrids are becoming very common in the NFL), and CB/RS Isaiah Rodgers from UMass (Incredible return skills)

I just find it interesting that we can make a list of 325 prospects and you can still find guys who didn't make the list at all that you really like as prospects."
1658,2020-03-22 23:09:04,fn6hn2,Jerry Jeudy better than Burrow LOL. Burrow is the best prospect regardless of position since Andrew Luck. you don't have the strongest arm of all time if you can maneuver the pocket as well as him
1659,2020-03-22 21:45:22,fn6hn2,"Probably because it goes by percentage points and them total points, so if Wirfs went 11/11 in his matchups of which prospect and Young went 10/10, Wirfs would be rated higher despite us not actually likely thinking that. That's why the top bit seems....less conventional. Because it's likely a bunch of prospects that went perfect or nearly perfect in all of the times they were picked and it came down to how many times their names appeared."

People just love to be contrarians... because if you are way wrong no one remembers.. and if by the off chance you are right... you can let everyone know for the next 5 years +
1663,2020-03-22 20:59:05,fn6hn2,"Thanks for the kind words, glad you enjoyed the draft board!"
1664,2020-03-23 17:03:47,fn6hn2,"These ratings are based off of the “all our ideas” algorithm, which calculates the chance that a prospect would win a random matchup. 

Last year, the ratings made a tad more sense just visually speaking, and we had about double the votes and the list of prospects was a bit smaller. So you’re probably onto something here. Nevertheless the rankings are still interesting to me just by looking at the general places where prospects landed and the positional rankings."
1665,2020-03-22 22:58:41,fn6hn2,He’s really commonly considered the 3rd best RB in the class behind Swift and Dobbins. That’s been my 3 for the longest time and I see that a lot.
1666,2020-03-24 12:16:58,fn6hn2,I think his real name is Thakarius which is only slightly better.
1667,2020-03-22 23:18:42,fn6hn2,"The redshirt senior, 1-year wonder that blew up playing with the best OL in the country, 2-to-3 1st round receivers, a future NFL TE, and a top RB that was great at receiving, while being coached by the best OC in college football, is definitely not the best prospect since Luck."
1668,2020-03-23 01:09:53,fn6hn2,"This would make sense. I voted for about 5-10 minutes and I must have seen Wirfs and Darrell Taylor about 10 times each, and other names came up a lot more common than others. I kept waiting for Burrow or Tua and didn't get either, and only saw Young once"

1670,2020-03-23 17:35:42,fn6hn2,">  “all our ideas” algorithm

I looked that up and found [this paper](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0123483#pone.0123483.s001) about the method. I don't exactly understand their method but it does seem to incorporate something like strength of schedule, so it might be hard to do better with the data you already have.

I still do think that there weren't enough votes for the rankings to stabilize. Also, having more options this year meant that the survey needed more votes in order to stabilize. Last year with 251 players and 43,863 votes, every possible pairing was voted on at least once and 40% of pairings were voted on twice. This year with 325 players and 15,606 votes, only 30% of possible pairings were voted on once and the rest weren't voted on at all. (Roughly; these numbers would be a little off if some pairings randomly get selected extra times.)"
1671,2020-03-22 23:36:22,fn6hn2,"First off.. he wasn’t an OC.. second are we sure he would have been the best OC? Is it not the fact he had the greatest QB in college football history(for one year. This isn’t debatable). That’s your opinion man. I think he’s actually a better prospect than luck. I think he’s the best prospect in over 20 years

Edit: and you realize he maded his Oline the best in the country right? Any average QB and they are a very very average line. Maybe above average. He avoided sacks better than anyone I’ve ever seen."

1704,2020-03-19 15:06:18,flb24c,The correct move is to dodge
1705,2020-03-19 15:21:13,flb24c,"This is basically a lose-lose situation. Personally, i think banning a hover is fine if it's a highly contested pick and the player is a last pick. Unless you're gonna swap picks, the last pick should understand there's a low chance of getting the pick. But, if they're hovering something they'll very likely get, then there's the problem.

I would say better to not ban. Yes, they may only have a 19% win rate. But that means you still had a 20% chance to win. You can work to increase those odds by camping top or rotating earlier or something. But banning could make the player int or you could be against a pre-made. Even though it's only 20%, that may end up being your best chance.

Everything that's been said is right. You're selfish for banning. They're selfish for playing something they're bad at. In the end, do what you think gives your team the best chance and hope it works out. 

In this case, maybe talk and ask him to pick something else. Maybe he'll understand and agree. Otherwise it's probably best to err on the side of caution and let people play what they want. A poor player is likely still better than an inter."

I think you lost the match because the human factor is the biggest part of the game.

1707,2020-03-19 14:46:46,flb24c,"I think its all born of that typical League mindset where everyone everywhere thinks they're a Chess Grandmaster.

No two ways about it, your ideal champ is the one you know the most and can play the most comfortably. Doesn't matter whether that's Shaco or Urgot or Nasus. And literally who are you to decide whether someone else can't play a champion?

1716,2020-03-19 15:01:15,flb24c,"I disagree with your evaluation. 

Sure you might have tilted the teammate for banning their champ hover, but from your POV the game is already lost if they play that champ. So at the end of the day it doesn't matter if you lose with that champ or with a different champ (because you banned the hover). 

But banning the champ and forcing them onto a different champ can increase your chances of winning."

1724,2020-03-19 14:48:39,flb24c,"You just described what happened when you did that... and based on your own experience that you just described, it sounds a lot worse than a bad team mate to me."
1725,2020-03-20 11:02:45,flb24c,"They can , by dodging you save yourself a loss , the dodge also doesn't affect mmr.

when you lose your promos , losing 2 games in promo means you have to play 2 or 3 games to reach promo again , dodging makes that less , you should do it if it's a guarnateed loss , you also save yourself some time."
1726,2020-03-19 16:06:25,flb24c,fair enough
1727,2020-03-19 16:00:14,flb24c,"Only if they don’t int. It’s all a value calculation. Let’s say the Riven player has a true 19% win rate with Riven. IMO 19% might be higher than the chance you don’t get inted for banning a teammates hover. 

So you’re likely to lose that game either way. Best thing you can do is dodge. If you can’t dodge then I think taking the low chances you win with the bad champion is better than hoping your team won’t tilt because of your actions."
1728,2020-03-19 14:52:30,flb24c,He's so deeply invested at being right that he never realized he was an asshole.
1729,2020-03-19 16:15:53,flb24c,"You have had this explained to you by multiple people, but you refuse to understand.

You have two options. You would like a mythical third option, but that doesn't exist.

* They play Riven and your probably lose
* You ban Riven, your team gets angry, they play something else badly because they are annoyed, and you still probably lose.

Your choice which of these two you pick.

The third option, which you seem to want, namely you banning Riven and everyone being happy and you likely win, isn't one that actually exists."
1730,2020-03-19 15:00:48,flb24c,"Given that they are on your team for the match it becomes your issue for that game. Failing to see this as a team game seems to be the main issue with your viewpoint. You want to pretend legue is some collection of numbers and odds but it's 5 people against 5 people. Being bad at a champ won't gaurntee a loss, but a tilted inting player cause you think you know beat and banned others requested champs sure will. 


Imagine if you qued your role, I have a higher winrate in that role than you, so I take it role and farm. Think you're gonna help me win?"
1731,2020-03-19 15:01:50,flb24c,"And this is why everyone says League is toxic as hell, it's full of self-indulgent attitudes lime that."
1732,2020-03-19 15:04:29,flb24c,Because they want to play zed and they hover it to specifically not have it banned. How about you queue and want to play a champ only to have it banned because your team thinks its bad?
1733,2020-03-19 16:14:23,flb24c,Finally. A kaisa main said something good. Thank you.
1734,2020-03-19 14:52:17,flb24c,"If you're having a bad season you're having a bad season but that rule is universal, and if you deliberately work against your teammate because YOU think you know what they should play better than THEY do you'll just piss everyone off and have the experience you described. It's not just some AI that's there to help you win. Its a person. That wanted to play Riven. You mentioned your personal bias against Riven, and went on a stat-tracker to JUSTIFY what you already wanted to do. The stats weren't the reason. They were the excuse. And they were arbitrary. You just found a reason to dick on a Riven because you think you're better than those players 'I just dont think they contribute anything to matches'. What you did is a dick move. Full stop."
1735,2020-03-19 20:37:05,flb24c,you dont lose mmr when you dodge even in promos. If climbing is your ultimate goal then dodging is the right choice.
1736,2020-03-19 15:00:09,flb24c,So your telling me a guy a 0 percent disco nunu over 300 games cant be judged? lol
1737,2020-03-19 14:51:41,flb24c,How so.
1738,2020-03-19 16:22:46,flb24c,"That's where I disagree--and this is merely a concept people will agree or disagree with.

Some people value the chance of going with the bad champion with the 19% w/r (to prevent someone running it down)

Others value banning that champ for a chance the person will play a champ they're better with to increase the chance of winning

Neither opinion is right or wrong. They're just both different perspectives and different ways of evaluating and making decisions."
1739,2020-03-19 14:59:31,flb24c,Oh no i can see that it may peeve people but i dont see how thats worse than making your own team lose or play at a massive disadvantage
1740,2020-03-19 15:59:49,flb24c,"Imagine feeling like you get to ""let"" people play their champs. Someone's mom gave them too much attention."
1741,2020-03-19 15:09:55,flb24c,"Isnt picking a champion that is almost certainly going to make your team lose self indulgent?

You are saying you losing on your weab champion is more important than having an actually competitive integrity."
1742,2020-03-19 15:10:42,flb24c,"Id just pick another champion. If my goal is to win in ranked league of legends why would I care whats banned. Furthermore, its a fucking 19 percent winrate riven pick lmfao"
1743,2020-03-19 15:41:21,flb24c,Because if you're hovering a broken champion and you're not first/second pick then I'm not risking it being taken by the enemy team.
1744,2020-03-19 15:07:51,flb24c,"""riven 3rd most played champ, 19 percent win rate 0.93 KDA over 30 games, averages like 3 cs per minute and goes nonesense items.""



Please justify having that poor of a stat showing over 30 games. Im genuinely curious"
1745,2020-03-20 10:59:45,flb24c,"Well this is a game where you should dodge , not just ban his champion and play the game."
1746,2020-03-19 14:59:53,flb24c,"""2 of them go ghost teleport and int...""

That's worse than carrying a bad team mate..."
1747,2020-03-19 16:40:46,flb24c,"It is a gut call really. In my experience they pretty much always run it down, or someone else does cause what you did is usually considered bad manners. But if I. Your experience they are likelier to change to another champion and do better than on their hover then that’s what you should do."
1748,2020-03-19 19:44:16,flb24c,"Honestly ill just troll on principle because you banned my hover for shitty reasons. Even if Im not particularly tilted.
19% winrate riven? How about the 5% winrate yuumi top. Ill try my best."
1749,2020-03-19 15:01:19,flb24c,You play at a massive disadvantage either way because you pissed of your teammates and chances are theyre even worse at a different champ anyway.
1750,2020-03-19 15:07:02,flb24c,Did you win or lose?
1751,2020-03-19 16:17:39,flb24c,How much narcissism do you want in one personality?
1752,2020-03-19 18:42:15,flb24c,No I'm saying having ACTUAL competitive integrity complete with sportsmanship is more valuable than having Fuccboi competitive integrity where your teammates are pawns to do your bidding
1753,2020-03-19 15:40:02,flb24c,"Purposefully pissing them off will result in a close to 0% wr. I'd rather take the 19%.

> If my goal is to win in ranked league of legends why would I care whats banned.

Because people don't have ONLY the goal of winning in ranked. They also want to enjoy the games."
1754,2020-03-19 19:40:25,flb24c,"Zed might be annoying but Im quite sure both Irelia and Kaisa do just fine into Zed. His WR isnt busted tier like Sett, Soraka, Janna, Sona etc were and wukong currently is. 

A champ has to be really busted for banning your team mates champ and even then you can pick it for him or have someone else do it."
1755,2020-03-19 15:24:18,flb24c,"This is a hard lesson to learn.  The facts and data can all be on your side but morally you can be wrong.

In order to win you screwed someone from 'Having a good time!' and because of that you all had a bad time and him and his friends/ or the other players can all say 'It was ALL your fault!'

It would have been different if he was your friend and you were sitting down with him IRL and talking LoL strategies and you said, 'Bro, you love Riven but man you choke on a bag of d$%ks with Riven!'  You are a superior Shaco.  Instead you did this to a stranger.

You did the equivalent of walking upto some random kid being loud at the grocery store and bitch slapped him because his parents weren't around.   50/50 chance the parents thank you/call the police."

1757,2020-03-19 15:04:41,flb24c,Actually every other champion they played was in the 55 percentile win rate range with decentish kdas. The ONLY one he couldnt play was riven
1758,2020-03-19 15:14:00,flb24c,"Lost. Did the other teams that have this riven win or lose?

Oh yeah they also lost. Overwhelmingly in fact."

1760,2020-03-19 15:51:20,flb24c,Oh thats awesome then you wont mind me banning your 19 percent suckfest because you are in it for the love of the game!
1761,2020-03-19 16:12:40,flb24c,"He's not PURPOSEFULLY pissing them off. He's trying to rescue his chance of winning promos. It's not his fucking responsibility to prevent people from getting pissed off and raging, showing their true colors. The riven was a dickhead before and after the ban."
1762,2020-03-19 20:38:54,flb24c,"Zed was just an example.. And I don't have to have ANY reason. I can ban what I want. If you want to play Zilean then sure but you're last pick Senna? Yeah, no."
1763,2020-03-19 15:25:37,flb24c,I wouldnt slap the kid but I would tell him to shut up if he was just screaming and being loud. Fair point. I can accept what you are saying
1764,2020-03-19 15:58:02,flb24c,"If you feel that a bad is the same as someone deliberately trolling, why go out of your way to piss someone off?


You're wrong because banning someone's pick has zero positive impact on the team. Best case, you pre-tilt one of your lanes, worst case you have a bunch of people throwing your series. I feel it's pretty easy to wrap your head around why having your team mates throw your series, but in case it's not clear, /having your team throw your series is worse than being forced to try and carry a bad team mate./


Do you want someone to come into this thread and tell you it's okay to throw a little tantrum when you get matched with a shitty team mate? It happens to everyone sometimes, but nobody gives a fuck."
1765,2020-03-19 15:06:55,flb24c,Do you honestly think banning the champ he hovers is going to make him try harder on a different champ? You can try to ask him not to play it but banning it will result in being trolled and losing the game garanteed instead of maybe being able to carry.

1767,2020-03-19 16:00:55,flb24c,How did your action improve your chances to win?
1768,2020-03-19 19:28:12,flb24c,"Oooooh look you pulled out the stats to show I haven't taken League seriously in years. You're the kind of jacked up stat-army weeb that is the literal reason I don't take it seriously.

Keep scrolling and you'll find the 2000+ 5v5 games I've played over my lifetime. But of course you dont want stats for stats, just stats to back up your own weakass mentality.

Like i said, arrogant narcissistic children.

That being said you went out of your way to look me up to find stats that allow you to dismiss my point, which just tells me my reasoning is sound and even you cant refute it without diving into League history. So thanks for backing up my point in your own insecure way. Lmao."
1769,2020-03-19 20:34:22,flb24c,Are you actually pulling out peoples OP.GG in a serious discussion? What kinda low tier shit is this?
1770,2020-03-22 15:46:49,flb24c,"Even as a salty, petty side-comment, that made absolutely no sense lmao"
1771,2020-03-22 15:46:21,flb24c,"What possible information do you have to make that assertion?

And please, tell me how someones League stats make them a dickhead like League of Legends has some actual influence on reality. Lmao.

Y'all gotta go outside more."
1772,2020-03-20 03:33:20,flb24c,"The champ would have to be extremely busted for that to really be a valid reason. Just cus its your ban doesnt mean its not bad manners to ban a teammates hover.

Its your car but that doesnt mean you can go ram it Into whatever you like.

People are fully justified in fucking you over in return for your BM."
1773,2020-03-22 15:48:58,flb24c,Sure you can ban what you want. And your teammates can wreck your game if THEY want cause they think you're an entitled little bitch. Tit for tat.
1774,2020-03-19 19:31:54,flb24c,"Why would I possibly care about what some person has to say about ""competitive integrity"" when you arent competitive"
1775,2020-03-22 16:05:59,flb24c,"It's not his stats. It's his actions and no regard for the other 9 people in queue that show he's a massive selfish dickhead. There is no excuse for acting the way riven acted, even if ""his"" champ was banned. Why is this even an argument?"
1776,2020-03-19 19:33:07,flb24c,"Because I'm so right you had to look up my stats to form a counter argument ;)

If you think competitive integrity only applies to people who hit challenger in ranked you really are a child"
1777,2020-03-22 15:43:06,flb24c,"Glad to see you deleted that petty bollocks. Humble yourself and your League matches will go better, I promise."
1778,2020-03-22 16:41:29,flb24c,You make it sound like he slapped your mom when literally the only thing the guy did was pick a champ they enjoy playing/wanted to play. You need to get outside more. This game matters so much it overwrites humanity and its pathetic
1779,2020-03-23 15:02:31,flb24c,Did you not read the post? Riven inted and forced the loss. Why do you keep telling me to go outside? You don't know me. You don't know a single thing about me. Some people live off this game and it pays a lot.

**Buyers and sellers, use the link above to verify where to redeem codes to ensure 4K codes redeem properly.**

**Feedback Logging (*Does not apply to GIVEAWAYS*)**

* Once a transaction has been completed, one user (buyer or seller) must create a comment (can be in-line with the deal discussion) tagging both [u/DCSbot](https://www.reddit.com/u/DCSbot) and the user they transacted with, for example  u\/moviehound.
 * The u/ is required, and the username for the bot ***MUST BE TYPED NOT COPY/PASTED*** to work properly.
* Once this is done, the tagged user must respond to that comment for feedback to be logged.
* If successful, the bot will respond to the second comment with ""Added"", and the number will increment for both.
 * Note that users with less than 10 transactions will show No Flair or New Member until reaching 10.

All discussions/negotiations about a potential transaction must be made via comments. Exchange codes/payment via PM or Reddit Chat. This helps to prevent scams and track trusted buyers and sellers.  **DO NOT RESPOND TO OFFERS MADE VIA PM OR CHAT.**

1916,2020-03-16 04:23:19,fjedgm,"With more and more women relying on Daddy government & welfare, i suspect the majority of white, brown and asian women will be following in the footsteps of black women and start exhibiting all the undesirable traits listed in OP analysis. In a couple years, the norm will be single moms with multiple kids from multiple men & men with kids they never get to see."
1917,2020-03-16 13:26:46,fjedgm,"I can try by best to explain it as a black man. 

Being black, you are automatically the “worst” unless you are a “god”. There’s not much “normal” black people in the worlds eyes. Either we’re considered stars/extremely successful or worthless trash that will never amount to anything and this is how we’re commonly portrayed in media. I don’t blame other races for being extra nervous/awkward around us because of this reason. 

With that being said, black guys had to learn how to work with being considered “lesser” at all times. We had to learn more game. We had to learn deeper insights than white people especially. Other races have + and - but white is the ultimate status symbol. The world is made for white guys. Every billboard to commercial has white guys in it and are mostly, at minimum, considered “potential” due to being put in better light. Sure, black guys became a fetish, but that’s about it- if we are wanted, it’s because we are black and everything else is considered 2nd. I completely understand Asian women with this relative problem as well (I’ve dated numerous Asian women and they are the relative equivalent to us. One girl would always show me the messages she got from white guys on dating apps and it truly is ridiculous. I had no idea how bad guys were in game until past gfs showed me the messages they’d get). 

So add in black women pretty much not being desirable on a world wide level (also with Asian men- they BOTH have characteristics which infiltrate the opposite sex and therefore wards them off) mixed in with black guys having to work 20x’s harder for a GENUINE RELATIONSHIP with a white/Spanish/Asian woman due to how society portrays us (not to mention if a girl is caught dating 1 black guy she is automatically know as “the girl who dates black guys” and loses positive popularity in most cases) and black guys must learn to see the ultimate reality much quicker, especially in comparison with white guys. 

I’m not trying to say that other women don’t like black guys. I’d say it’s quite the opposite in reality due to becoming taboo in the status of social groups- and taboo+rarity=some type of added worth. But it’s still an underlying rule to look lower on a woman who dates/married a black guy. We have to acknowledge this as a reality at all times and this is something white guys NEVER have to deal with. This is the core reason why black guys accept the red pill much easier at much younger ages."

The man probably got the mother in US after working hard all his life, give better provisions in a first world country of opportunities, daughter born here to privileges that millions and millions of women around the world can't even fathom, and they are calling their man of the house ""ugly"". At least the comments in the thread were heart warming. Every single guy of all races were hating on them, with only a couple of female voices mildly objecting.

Brown women are way worse actually, the most self hating of them all. They are not vocal (yet) enough to show their degeneracy and destruction full on. There is a reason those parts of the world were raided and occupied for centuries. Matriarchal societies with absolutely no dignity and strategies that lead straight to the enemies."
1940,2020-03-16 19:23:44,fjedgm,"Thanks for putting this here.  It's really important for all of us, no matter what race, to understand all of this.    Personally, I think this has its roots in the ""Great Society"" of the 1960s giving free welfare money to black women with children. Well.   Women saw this and said ""I'll just have a child and get free money and an apartment and free medical care from the government and I don't have to put up with a man.""

And so, men and women in the black community have for decades learned how to ""get over"" on each other.   How to use and take advantage of each other.   How to screw each other over, and get what they can, while they can.   

Black families were as intact as any others in the depression, during WW2 and in the immediate post war period.    They were poorer.  They were subjected to racism.  They didn't have as much.   They were disadvantaged.   But most married and had intact families with a husband and wife, who lived with their children.   Why did those men stay with their wives?  Because that was the only way to get sex.   Multiplied by about 10 because they were black men and were still mostly segregated.    Why did those women stay with their husbands?  Because as hard as it was with those men, it would be way, WAY harder without them - multiplied by a factor of 10 because they were black women.  Not only were they black and segregated, they were also women - and black women had it very, very hard going it alone in pre-1950 America.    Black women were a lot safer and a lot better off by selecting one man and staying with him, even when that meant a life of hard work for low pay.   It was hard and they didn't have much, but they had each other, and that was good enough.

With the advent of free money and incentivizing single motherhood, that all ended."

Lack of strong masculine role models, so they project what they think a man is/does.  It's a subset of the ""I don't need no man"" phenomenon that we're now seeing of women of all races.  

The problem?  Women make terrible men. They don't understand what it is to be a man, so they emulate the most undesirable male traits. The farther away from positive masculinity, the worse the projection.  They literally get their images from the tee-vee, music, or other artificial sources.

Ah yes, the old 'legacy of slavery' argument.  Black men were treated as subhuman 150 years ago so black men today have no masculine role models.

It ignores the 150 years of history after slavery.  It ignores the great black role models of the 19th century, the black colleges, the talented tenth, the fact that Harlem was an UPPER MIDDLE CLASS SUBURB before the Great society.

I don't think it has to do with black men at all.  It has to do with giving $$ to black women, financing their thottery, and encouraging them to have babies without a man in the house.  This displaced the black man from his traditional leadership of the family.  This caused black crime to increase when the bastard children of undisciplined single mom welfare queens ran wild in the community.

Want proof of that timetable.  Look at the white community today.  Give women free $$ and society collapses.  You can ONLY have a society when women are under control and rewarded for good behavior and PUNISHED for bad behavior.  Today they are encouraged and rewarded for bad behavior and we see the total collapse of Western civilization is nigh.

Black men were just the Tuskegee Women's freedom experiment and like the Tuskegee study, they wanted to see what would happen when the disease (in this case ""feminism"") was allowed to run rampant.

They are just the test case; the canary in the coal mine.  All men were the target from the beginning."

Legacy of slavery?  No!  Not my argument at all!!!!  Unless you speak some other language and spell slavery 'L-B-J'...  
Anyone who has seen me post knows that I quote two factors REPEATEDLY:

1.  From the late 1800's (when data was first collected) until the early 1970's black American families had the same (if not slightly higher) intact family rates than the national average. If there was any stat that is ignored, THIS is the one.  

2. LBJ's welfare ""reforms"" were the point where this declined. Your Harlem point validates this position if we look at the timeline of Harlem's decline (and that of upper-and middle-class Black America). But more on that later.  


> I don't think it has to do with black men at all. It has to do with giving $$ to black women, financing their thottery, and encouraging them to have babies without a man in the house. 

Chicken and egg, but in the end, that discussion is now irrelevant.  Let's assume (as we probably both agree) that the incentivization of women to rely on Daddy Gub'mint was the first stone cast.  Fine.  Women raise boys by themselves and create flawed men. It takes a man to raise a man and women make terrible men. Women either continued to raise boys by themselves (creating broken men) or chose from a pool of already brainwashed and broken men (of their creation) that don't stand up to their thottery, or worse yet, act like the very single mamas they were raised by.  

The women started the cycle.  No argument there.  But the root still comes down to a lack of proper men to raise men into men. Women made this initial choice and continue to make this choice.  But in the end?  The solution still comes down to men saying 'no'.  There is a marked difference between blame and root-cause analysis.  The weakness in the core has EVERYTHING to do with black men. Women created an environment where there is a dearth of strong black men in the family--either by eschewing them or creating flawed copies that create more flawed copies.

> Black men were just the Tuskegee Women's freedom experiment and like the Tuskegee study, they wanted to see what would happen when the disease (in this case ""feminism"") was allowed to run rampant. 

Interesting choice of analogy.  I somewhat agree although I think it was less targeted than that. The welfare reforms weren't aimed at black folks.  I would even argue that the pro-Black/Pan-African movement was an unwitting, unwilling accelerant.  The move of black independence and black strength ran parallel to the rise in 2nd wave feminism.  Guess what black women did?  Projected as usual.  They felt that they could also be strong black men and then let the white women use them as human political shields just as the current wave has done. Their entry into the white collar world at this time fed into this loop.  The ""I can bring home the bacon"" commercial now applied to them as well.  The inflationary era of Jimmy Carter (along with the embargoes of the early 1970s) put black men (and other non-white collar laborers) behind. The reforms were aimed at the poor and disenfranchised.  Black folks simply had the right set of circumstances to be most affected.

On a pop culture note, the series Mad Men portrayed this quite accurately.  Who were the first employees of color in the the Madison offices?    


> They are just the test case; the canary in the coal mine. All men were the target from the beginning. 

Agree 1000%.  In fact, I use the exact same terminology to describe the situation.  You may not realize it but we believe most, if not all of the same things.  

As to your point of ""all men"", the GOVERNMENT point of the reforms was to get as many people dependent on the government as possible.  In a quest for power, 2nd-wave feminism made sure this happened.  Was it intentional?  I'm not sure.  Part of me thinks it was not.  Their goal was simply power.  They wanted to seize power and usurp men by any means necessary. I don't think there was any examination of consequences.  The government was willing to fund their power grab and that's as far as they thought it out.  **Get money, disregard males, become a male.**"

I think Donovan will slowly be transitioned into a PG whether Mike leaves or not after next year. We have 3 players that needs the ball in their hands in our starting lineup and the best decision is to move him once he feels comfortable enough.

Like you said, our SG spot is already stacked and Donovan moving to PG won’t change that. Our forward spots are what needs improvement. We have Joe/Bojan who are going to regress as they age, Royce, and Niang who will likely continue playing 8-12 minutes a game. We need a Brandon Clarke type of prospect who has the athletic capabilities to guard stronger 4s and shoot 3s."

If we can improve our athleticism with the pick also, that would be ideal. If we can trade up for someone like Tyler Bey, that would be awesome."

2011,2020-03-14 18:22:33,fieulr,"> We need a Brandon Clarke type of prospect who has the athletic capabilities to guard stronger 4s and shoot 3s.

Killian Tillie might be that guy (played with Brandon Clarke last year). He's 6'10"", a 40% three point shooter and takes them at a decent clip (1.5/3.8 is his average this season on only 24 mpg). Not sure how his defense will translate to the NBA, but he's a pretty good collegiate defender.

Saddiq Bey is another interesting player. He's only 6'8, so more on the SF side than PF, but I think he could bulk up a little more and play more minutes at the 4 than Bojan or Joe. He's a 45% 3pt shooter in college and he's another guy that I've seen available in the end of the first round in most places. I think his defense is a question mark though.

Jalen Smith might be the best option. He's a 37% 3pt shooter, a terrific rebounder and the best defender of the three. I'm a little worried he could go before 24, but he would be a great pick for Utah."

Don't know if there would be much interest there. Didn't sound like much of a market for Ed at the Trade deadline.

>If we can improve our athleticism with the pick also, that would be ideal. If we can trade up for someone like Tyler Bey, that would be awesome.

Local Utah guys like Sam Merrill and Yeoli Childs really needed the tournament to prove themselves on a national stage and build their stock -- they could be steals in the second round (which is easy to buy into for cash), especially if they go undrafted.

2062,2020-03-18 15:03:39,fi1f58,This might be stupid question to ask but how much cap-space did we start at?
2063,2020-03-20 15:53:53,fi1f58,I think there was a report that we resigned Dean Marlowe.
2064,2020-03-21 16:16:13,fi1f58,Any new reports?
2065,2020-03-23 23:14:09,fi1f58,Patrick DiMarco had his contract reconstructed
2066,2020-03-23 23:23:36,fi1f58,"[Jefferson](https://www.spotrac.com/nfl/buffalo-bills/quinton-jefferson-19101/)

[Dimarco](https://overthecap.com/player/patrick-dimarco/2462/)"
2067,2020-03-25 14:45:15,fi1f58,this is our year
2068,2020-04-15 02:54:02,fi1f58,Apparently we signed C/G Evan Boehm.
2069,2020-03-20 16:19:19,fi1f58,"Glad it's not gonna be Gurley. Let's go Gordon.

Edit: no problem. Draft time, baby."
2070,2020-03-13 15:56:57,fi1f58,I’ll take a look and update it.  I just kind threw this together this morning.
2071,2020-03-16 03:24:14,fi1f58,updated
2072,2020-03-18 12:45:39,fi1f58,I think this may be the only thing I haven't liked that they have done.
2073,2020-03-21 13:45:56,fi1f58,"Word from the beat writers was that the bills wanted Lawson back on a less than $10m deal, and he got more than that from the Dolphins.  Addison is an upgrade over him and on a shorter contract which keeps the team flexible for signing their own guys."
2074,2020-03-21 02:19:24,fi1f58,I’m guessing their drafting more dline this year
2075,2020-03-21 13:44:25,fi1f58,"I think this is fair.  I also think that’s the logic behind the Diggs trade.  You can’t say “but the WR1 is a rookie, let’s see what they look like next year” when the WR1 is an established vet."
2076,2020-03-21 13:47:12,fi1f58,His contract sucked which lowered his value
2077,2020-03-15 19:33:06,fi1f58,That is fucking outrageous. Beane needs to be working them for some of their talent rn
2078,2020-03-13 16:23:44,fi1f58,5 days til this thread is WILDIN
2079,2020-03-17 14:49:58,fi1f58,"Not sure how I feel giving up a 1st, but this is supposed to be a pretty deep WR draft class. So hopefully we can pick up a WR to develop as well."
2080,2020-03-20 21:36:04,fi1f58,I mean the chiefs didn't really do anything.
2081,2020-03-21 16:47:38,fi1f58,"Did the Rams address their O-line?, because that was big problem for them last season, I think I heard they had the oldest average aged O-line in the NFL."
2082,2020-03-18 00:36:46,fi1f58,Sad to see him go.
2083,2020-03-17 04:27:18,fi1f58,"I have a feeling we still get a WR in the draft. I mentioned it earlier that we needed a guy ready to play now, which was why I wanted a FA. I still think you draft a guy like Claypool in the 3rd. Tall, huge, and fast, but a bit of a project and he'll have 3 years to learn as a backup.

Definitely need to get the best edge we can in round 2

edit: Fucking McBeane. Got our 3 biggest needs out of the way so he can go BPA in the draft. HOLY SHIT we have a GM."
2084,2020-03-20 18:18:00,fi1f58,Interesting
2085,2020-03-21 20:42:10,fi1f58,Please no
2086,2020-03-20 18:58:06,fi1f58,"I am curious how Jones will effect Andre Robert's role on the team, that is if Roberts is still currently on the roster."
2087,2020-03-20 00:51:31,fi1f58,got it
2088,2020-03-16 14:18:03,fi1f58,Its updated now.
2089,2020-03-21 15:47:01,fi1f58,"I’m glad we didn’t chase that. Singletary is our guy and we need a RB2, but could easily be picked up in this draft."
2090,2020-03-20 19:43:56,fi1f58,For the right price.
2091,2020-03-20 17:10:57,fi1f58,That is player I figured that Beane would go after.
2092,2020-03-21 20:42:33,fi1f58,Take adv of BoB again
2093,2020-03-21 12:06:49,fi1f58," Addison (DE)and Butler (DT) both are Carolina alumni and more or less are Lawson and Philips replacements. From what I hear Jefferson is great signing coming over from Seattle and can play both DE and DT. I am not sure about Klein(also a former panther)I think someone said he was great against the run but not great in coverage.  The other LB from Pittsburgh I forgot his name, from what I hear is mostly a ST gunner at which he is solid.  Overall the two DT guys who we signed  might make Star Lotulelei expendable at which with his contract being reconstructed recently there is good chance he is gone by next season."
2094,2020-04-05 00:08:14,fi1f58,"they can get an RB compliment in this draft. The RB position is pretty easy to find contributors in the current NFL. Lots of good options in this draft and still in FA after the draft to compete with Yeldon.

Also our offence sorely missed a true #1. It was very obvious in crunch time against Houston when no one could get open and Allen felt he had to do too much."
2095,2020-03-18 19:12:42,fi1f58,We had just about 80mil by the start of free agency.
2096,2020-03-21 16:13:36,fi1f58,"There was, thanks for the reminder I’ll get right on it"
2097,2020-03-13 16:22:36,fi1f58,Dont you mean /u/redditbills did? Youre. Stealing valour.
2098,2020-03-16 03:25:14,fi1f58,Thanks for your work!
2099,2020-03-22 00:15:07,fi1f58,"Diggs overrated, we over payed, we build through the draft I don't like the move. We knew Josh would need time to develop why you would want to put all the pressure on him in year 3 makes me sense to me when we could have had a WR as good and potentially better than diggs and kept our picks and continue building the right way how we have been."
2100,2020-03-16 03:38:17,fi1f58,"Yngakoue is my #1 FA TARGET.

GET EM BEANE!!!"
2101,2020-03-18 12:44:38,fi1f58,"I saw a list of all the #1 wr traded this offseason, there were about 15 trades and only one didn't include a 1st round and that was Bill O'Brien screwing over the texans. He's been seriously flamed for it. I think the 1st round makes perfect sense for Diggs. Expensive but worth it."
2102,2020-03-21 04:19:12,fi1f58,Im ok as long as he don't get pissed if Allen is more comfy with Brown and Beasley while throwing swings to Singletary.
2103,2020-03-20 22:01:04,fi1f58,Yeah but they are still really good
2104,2020-03-26 18:01:35,fi1f58,They are holding back so that they can make Pat Mahomes Jr. the new highest paid QB in the league.
2105,2020-03-17 15:01:34,fi1f58,Claypool is one of my most wanted prospects now as well. Dude is a beast but will need time to grow into his role here
2106,2020-03-23 11:57:46,fi1f58,What about Christian Wade?
2107,2020-03-20 17:26:41,fi1f58,I’d be happy with him or Freeman. But I think Hyde is more realistic
2108,2020-03-18 19:31:22,fi1f58,So we are still in pretty good shape.
2109,2020-03-13 16:33:10,fi1f58,🤨
2110,2020-03-16 15:32:44,fi1f58,I stole some velour once. Have been banned from Michaels fabrics ever since.
2111,2020-03-14 02:11:40,fi1f58,You're!
2112,2020-03-24 01:32:02,fi1f58,"Because you have to pay a fortune for his next contract, like $30M  year and he has to prove he is worth it before you pay it. Almost zero chance we would get a player in the draft that will be better than Diggs is now. Like it or not Allen is not worth a huge starters contract at this point. He needs to go from bottom 5 in QB rating to top 15 in two years, top 20 this year at least."
2113,2020-03-16 18:54:54,fi1f58,He's not a FA he's tagged.
2114,2020-03-22 00:18:23,fi1f58,Really wanted to get him
2115,2020-03-18 19:06:18,fi1f58,I mean Beane has always said his approach is to fill holes with FA and draft for development. It makes complete sense given the draft is a crapshoot whether the player will pan out or not.
2116,2020-03-21 13:59:58,fi1f58,What are the dolphins jetes and pats doing
2117,2020-03-17 17:20:20,fi1f58,abosolutely. If we can grab him he completely changes our WR core. Every time I run a mock I try to get him in the third.
2118,2020-03-18 20:22:34,fi1f58,Yep! This is the rebuild McBean has been planning for since taking control a few years ago.
2119,2020-03-16 19:27:53,fi1f58,Yeah. I know. They tagged him but hd wants out. I've posted all about it. Just brainfart here. Thanks!
2120,2020-03-21 18:07:40,fi1f58,Dolphins have made some good moves and have 3 first round picks jets havent really done anything the pats dont look great right now but its still bellicheck
2121,2020-03-22 00:17:55,fi1f58,I fear that he won't make it out of the second round because his ceiling is so high
2122,2020-03-22 00:26:25,fi1f58,"yea, might be true. How would you feel about us taking him in the late 2nd? I would be hyped."
2123,2020-03-22 01:20:56,fi1f58,Depends on the board. I would definitely be hyped to have him though. I feel like we need some combo of OT/WR/CB taken in rounds 2 and 3 with the exception of if a top tier RB falls for some reason. Trade downs also seem to working pretty well for us in the mocks drafts I've done but those are only so realistic.
2124,2020-03-22 01:54:14,fi1f58,ya I have the same thing. I don't think CB will be at value but who knows how the Bills have them ranked. I think OT in the 2nd will also be at good value if certain WR are off the board.
2125,2020-03-12 19:45:36,fhlr7j,"I have really dug the first few episodes. 

This episode is amazing."
2126,2020-03-14 19:05:36,fhlr7j,This is the kind of episode I need! I (white woman) got into Tyler Perry movies and plays about 2008. They were fun and sometimes poignant and I enjoyed them. Then it became clear at some point there was a shift in what I heard from black culture saying he was problematic. I am thankful to be able to hear this conversation and understand the nuanced issues better!
2127,2020-03-13 02:20:59,fhlr7j,Oh I’m super excited to listen to this one.
2128,2020-03-13 03:41:55,fhlr7j,A very exciting episode. I love how both of them are journalists. They disclosed so much bias information right away. It’s real integrity.
2129,2020-03-13 10:12:04,fhlr7j,Oh man this sounds interesting af. I'll have to check this one out.
2130,2020-03-11 18:15:24,fh19sv,How did he get his dead mother's dna to check?
2131,2020-03-12 16:34:11,fh19sv,he is halfish that dna no?
2132,2020-05-10 02:14:18,fh19sv,"Why would he need his mother’s DNA for a *paternity* test? 

Isn’t a DNA test “hey do I share half my DNA with person A” and any other contributors are irrelevant?"

2143,2020-06-10 14:11:13,fh141j,"Very different stuff but The Chapelle Show and Key And Peele are some of the best things to grace television.
  
Also just so you're aware, at least in the US, the term black humor refers to ""dark in subject matter"" or just called dark comedy. As far as comedy in relation to black people then there isn't really a set phrase..."
2144,2020-03-11 23:00:17,fh141j,The term is dark comedy
2145,2020-03-11 18:31:35,fh141j,Will do! Does it have a similar leftist edge to it?

2186,2020-03-09 17:45:54,ffygn1,"If players are listed on both ""Dead Cap"" and PS/Futures is the original dead cap number when they were first signed to the team and then released? 

Ray Ray, Dodson and Lewis I know were with the team during training camp and I believed were cut at one point. 

Regardless of the above it's nice to see basically chump change in that section instead of what we used to see in high seven figures."

2196,2020-03-09 18:58:31,ffygn1,"If they keep Kroft, which they might aswell do if nothing better fall into their lap, then I would guess they have him battle for Roster spot. The team obviously values him as they sacrificed an initial 53 man spot last season to stash him on IR."
2197,2020-03-09 17:51:42,ffygn1,"This is pretty much a copy paste of /u/DirtyDeedsInc, so you'd have to ask him. But I am taking it over for now since we agreed to terms with Norman."

2273,2020-04-18 21:31:36,g3uzw6,That is pretty high for Bey and Terry but tbf I have Okongwu in my top 3 so we’re all a little different lol
2274,2020-04-18 21:56:39,g3uzw6,"Some names sprinkled throughout the top 20 that I was taken aback by their spots be it high/low, but overall it is a solid board. I would say it certainly seems unique in the sense that it is interesting and portrays that you project certain players different than the norm, which is a reason for having your own board. I respect and appreciate the list as a whole. 

Hats off to you."
2275,2020-04-18 22:48:10,g3uzw6,Having wiseman at 13 is an automatic disqualification
2276,2020-04-18 23:04:16,g3uzw6,"I don’t really get the Tyrell Terry love. The size of Trae Young, tries just as hard on D lol, but not anywhere close as a passer. I also don’t think he’s on the same level athletically, Trae had no trouble beating guys off the dribble at Oklahoma, or as skilled overall 

I like KOC from the Ringer but his notes on Terry didn’t convince me at all"
2277,2020-04-18 22:25:59,g3uzw6,"A lot of controversial takes, but nothing I would consider ridiculous. Overall I really enjoyed the difference in prospective your board provides on candidates you are high on. Personally I think you're a bit high on Jalen Smith and Saddiq Bey, while being too low on Onyeka and Deni. However, I agree with your placement of Pokusevski and Vassell wholeheartedly."
2278,2020-04-18 23:08:18,g3uzw6,"There are easier ways to shout ""I'm a contrarian"" than putting Maxey and Deni outside the lottery. Growing a mohawk for instance."
2279,2020-04-18 23:31:14,g3uzw6,"I’d bet anything that there won’t be even 30 guys from this class more valuable than Carey, much less 47."
2280,2020-04-18 22:35:53,g3uzw6,Bolmaro that low? I have seen him as a first round pick in some mocks.
2281,2020-04-18 23:25:31,g3uzw6,First thing that sticks out is Saddiq Bey would be sown a lot further for me
2282,2020-04-18 23:43:59,g3uzw6,Okongwu at 8 and Stewart at 52 after Stewart dominated him on both ends during both games this year is interesting. OO got exposed during that game and he has no ability to deal with strength. any team will be able to throw a second string bruising center at OO and he’s going to crumble
2283,2020-04-19 01:07:09,g3uzw6,"Cool board, and I like the Vassell love. How high is too for him in this draft? 

A player like him always seem to have rules and criteria’s why he should not be a top pick, then a middle-of-the pack team scoops him up and he does nothing but produce, elevating said team next season and beyond.

Edit — I’m also wondering the same about Maxey. I like both of these players quite a bit and think they both should be top 6 picks."
2284,2020-04-19 08:40:37,g3uzw6,Interesting take. I'm an IA state homer so love Haliburton obviously. The kid has great vision/high IQ and will continue to grow each year imo. He is incredibly lengthy and will be a defensive threat at the next level. Hayes looks very solid as well. I'm interested to see how Wiseman and Anthony fit because people are either really high on them or the opposite. I like Maxey in the top 10 also
2285,2020-04-18 23:52:44,g3uzw6,Killian Hayes looks pretty convincing
2286,2020-04-19 00:57:20,g3uzw6,This is terrible in my opinion
2287,2020-04-19 18:51:23,g3uzw6,Definitely doesn’t have the movement skills of a Covington.  Nor the playmaking ability on defense
2288,2020-04-19 22:36:40,g3uzw6,I like your board. I have Bolmaro way higher (top 20 for me) and you're a good bit higher on Oturu than I am. Have you checked out Grant Riller? One of the best off-the-dribble creators in the class imo. He is pretty old though...
2289,2020-04-18 22:51:13,g3uzw6,Carey in the second round? Hell nah
2290,2020-04-19 00:23:01,g3uzw6,What's the justification for having Edwards and Haliburton over Hayes?
2291,2020-04-18 23:17:34,g3uzw6,In general I favor wings/guards who can shoot. Hence my high placement for Bey. Terry I looked at KOC's big board and then did my own research on him and I can see the hype around him. Definitely gonna be a controversial prospect!
2292,2020-04-18 23:17:52,g3uzw6,Appreciate it. Thanks for looking at it!
2293,2020-04-18 23:57:04,g3uzw6,"There's no ""disqualification"" on any of these until at least 3 years from now."
2294,2020-04-18 23:46:06,g3uzw6,Is it though? What is it about Wiseman's scouting report that makes you think he's likely to be more than an obsolete rim running center? I see his range of outcomes as somewhere between Cauley-Stein and Gobert which makes him good value at 13 but not exactly a steal
2295,2020-04-18 23:16:33,g3uzw6,Yeah he definitely has upside I just didn't trust the sample size with him and the fact that he's limited in horizontal mobility.
2296,2020-04-19 01:42:52,g3uzw6,"Give me a likely outcome where Wiseman is any better than an average starting center. What does he improve? He’s really poor as a pick and roll defender, his hands are really bad, his shot is flat and doesn’t project to three, and he doesn’t move well laterally. 

Center has the highest replacement level in the NBA, do you want to spend a lottery pick on a replacement level center when you can find them in free agency for $5m a year? I’d rather roll the dice with a wing player with versatility or a potential initiator"
2297,2020-04-18 23:26:30,g3uzw6,I think in this draft I'm looking for a potentially game-breaking skill. Terry I think can get to that level as a shooter/distributor. And yeah KOC's big board definitely turned me onto Terry haha. Thanks for reading!
2298,2020-04-18 23:19:30,g3uzw6,Thanks for reading! Jalen Smith is definitely my most out there placement on the board. I just was really convinced by what I saw of him in college as a shooter and rim protector. He'll need to get stronger to be a defensive difference in the NBA but I really liked what I saw at Maryland.
2299,2020-04-19 18:45:50,g3uzw6,"How is Bey not simply a Covington clone? No more, no less. Every team with a star wants that more than ""potential"". I don't see how he doesn't go top 10."
2300,2020-04-18 22:36:48,g3uzw6,I think Avdija that low is kinda ridiculous considering many have him as top 5.
2301,2020-04-18 23:24:48,g3uzw6,I'll look into it!
2302,2020-04-19 00:05:01,g3uzw6,We'll see!
2303,2020-04-18 23:24:28,g3uzw6,Yeah I'll admit that my research on Bolmaro wasn't that strong. From what I watched though I just wasn't too impressed. Thanks for reading!
2304,2020-04-19 18:50:06,g3uzw6,He looks like a replica of Covington. That's what everyone wants right?
2305,2020-04-18 23:31:37,g3uzw6,Yeah that's a fair complaint. I just like his shooting and defensive promise. He definitely isn't the most fluid mover but I like what he brings. Also I like wings a LOT more than bigs as you can probably tell. Thanks for reading!
2306,2020-04-19 00:04:48,g3uzw6,Yeah I definitely paid attention to that game. Was not encouraging for Okongwu at all. The stark difference between Okongwu and Stewart just came down to upside. I would say though that I am not particularly strong at evaluating big guys.
2307,2020-04-19 03:02:30,g3uzw6,"> How high is too for him in this draft? A player like him always seem to have rules and criteria’s why he should not be a top pick

I think he’s a go after the top 3. The reason guys like him usually aren’t top picks is because the guys above them have more upside and/or can impact a game more. Looking at the past 5 or so drafts I’d probably take him at then end of the lottery or at #15 but in this years draft I think he’s fair game after Ball/Wiseman/Edwards depending on fit.

Those are really the guys with high end upside and everybody else is basically destined to be a starter/role player that would have to have a lot of things break fright for them to be a star. Vassell fits in here and so if he feels like the right fit for a team I think it’s smart to take him because he’s a sure case that has some upside as a 3rd/4th scorer."
2308,2020-04-19 01:17:35,g3uzw6,"Honestly I'm not sure. I've been super high on Vassell since like January when he was first starting to be regularly talked about. He went from a second round pick to a possible top 10 pick in like 3 months. I'm a Bulls fan so seeing that Vassell would fill a need, I wouldn't mind them taking him at 5-6. I want Haliburton first for the Bulls then either Ball or Vassell. It'll vary from team to team but I don't think any team should be discouraged from taking him in the top 7. Thanks for reading!"
2309,2020-04-19 00:05:31,g3uzw6,The more I watch him the more I like him. Could easily slide into the top 2 for me.
2310,2020-04-19 00:59:13,g3uzw6,Appreciate the feedback!
2311,2020-04-19 23:09:50,g3uzw6,Thanks for reading! And yeah Bolmaro is one of those guys who will probably rise on my board after watching him more in depth. Riller is the Charleston guy right? I think Sam Vecenie from The Athletic had him top 30 in his latest big board. I'll definitely check him out.
2312,2020-04-18 23:25:16,g3uzw6,He might go in the first round. This is a big board rather than a mock draft. Thanks for reading!
2313,2020-04-19 00:51:58,g3uzw6,"With Edwards it's the physical gifts that he possesses. He's not consistent obviously, and his defense leaves a LOT to be desired, but it's just an upside play with him. With Haliburton, I love his playmaking ability. He also has a really infectious personality and is a smart kid. His film session with Mike Schmitz really won me over. Good length for a PG and despite his weird mechanics he was a knockdown shooter. Hayes I still really like. He's a guy that as we progress through May/June/July I could have him moving up to as high as 1. Right now though what troubles me is that his handle isn't that strong and he never goes right. That being said, he's been really effective for Ulm without a right hand, so maybe I should have him higher!"
2314,2020-04-18 23:20:39,g3uzw6,"100%! Especially with Trae Young playing as he has will make near playoff teams think he could be the difference maker, looking at you Orlando"
2315,2020-04-18 23:59:45,g3uzw6,You’re welcome. Look forward to seeing what you post in the future.
2316,2020-04-19 00:01:10,g3uzw6,That's kinda my thoughts on him as well. If he had more of a skill package in place I'd put him higher but I just don't see that yet.
2317,2020-04-18 23:51:27,g3uzw6,There’s other games besides just him at Memphis
2318,2020-04-19 21:00:53,g3uzw6,Yeah I like Bey a lot. He seems like a high floor top 10 pick to me.
2319,2020-04-18 22:43:29,g3uzw6,I think he will end up going in the 5-10 range with late lottery being the latest he'll go. You never know what might happen with medical evals or team interviews though. Look at Robert Williams.
2320,2020-04-18 23:23:41,g3uzw6,"My main worry with Avdija is more of a trend situation. If you go back to international players who played overseas that were selected in the top 10, there's a huge discrepancy in production between players who started for their teams and those who didn't. Deni didn't start for Maccabi so I worry about how he'll translate to the NBA. For example players like Dragon Bender, Darko Milicic, and Mario Hezonja all did not start while Porzingis, Luka, and Dirk all started. Just a trend thing more than anything else."
2321,2020-04-18 23:27:09,g3uzw6,Yeah I don’t really like him but he isn’t that bad.
2322,2020-04-18 23:38:25,g3uzw6,Yeah definitely.  Same here.  I actually don’t think Saddiq has the movement skills to play on the wing in the NBA.  I think of him more as a combo forward in terms of how he will translate to the NBA.  He’s got pretty stiff hips and I think the game will be too quick for him at the next level if he’s on the wing.  We will see though!
2323,2020-04-19 07:14:26,g3uzw6,Love this response
2324,2020-04-18 23:29:00,g3uzw6,Yeah I'd love that for Orlando. Nothing against Vucevic or Fournier but they just aren't the most exciting players haha.
2325,2020-04-19 00:02:42,g3uzw6,Thanks!
2326,2020-04-19 02:03:47,g3uzw6,"He has a great skill package for a 7’1 teenager. You don’t see it because he played 3 games at Memphis and did what the coaching staff asked him to do: dominate the interior. In HS he showed a promising handle, faceup game, and decent jumpshot.

Bam Adebayo’s stock plummeted at Kentucky because ppl thought the same thing (ohh he’s just a rim-running big) then the Heat brought him in workouts and realized a lot of the skill was hidden in college. Fast forward a few years and the skill package he has has been harvested."
2327,2020-04-19 00:02:23,g3uzw6,My rule is that I use AAU stuff for college evaluations and then college stuff for NBA evaluation. I don't think seeing Wiseman dunk on everyone in high school really gives me a good enough foundation.
2328,2020-04-18 23:01:11,g3uzw6,Robert Williams or Nasir little are good examples but Deni is considered top 3 by a lot and I’d say the majority believe he is top 5 or top 7
2329,2020-04-18 23:26:21,g3uzw6,"That is true.A common misconception that Americans do is that they think that just because they play in the euro league they are auto busts/great picks.Ex Hezonja and Doncic,one was MVP the other 7th-9th man. With that being said Avdija played great in the u20 tournament and shows true promise in a weak class.Last year I would have him in the 10-20 range, but this year I’d say top 5."
2330,2020-04-20 23:48:59,g3uzw6,"Honestly,  I don't think any of the other top prospect in this draft would start on his team. As being said, he's playing in a top 5 team in Europe, a team  that only care about winning now, with a massive noisy crowd, that have no patience for mistakes. You guys really see players like LaMelo, Edwards, Haliburton, Okoro etc.  starting in their lineup? because I don't. They are too raw and  inefficient as a teenagers who just started to learn the game. These elite European teams are all about experienced players.  Watching Hayes  for example, he is playing in the worst team in the EuroCup, a much  weaker league than the Euroleague, and I'm 100% sure he wouldn't get  minutes at all at Deni's team, not even off the bench). So the fact Deni actually have a big  role there is speak for itself."
2331,2020-04-19 00:03:47,g3uzw6,"Yeah that is definitely my primary concern with him. I just think in a draft this barren of explosive talent, he seems like a safer top ten pick."
2332,2020-04-19 02:27:41,g3uzw6,"Dude I looked at his stats and he put up fucking 

20/11 and 3 blocks in **23 minutes per game**

Small sample size but still"
2333,2020-04-19 01:17:13,g3uzw6,"
Yeah but when you’re talking about not enough sample size then that’s your best option instead of underranking him. 

How will you do your draft board if/when the one and done rule is abolished?

Where would you have had the high school guys of the 2000s in your draft ranks with limited samples?"
2334,2020-04-18 23:30:21,g3uzw6,Yeah there are definitely things to like about Avdija. He's also playing on a really good international team so that's also a factor.
2335,2020-04-19 02:34:42,g3uzw6,"Lol yeah I think ppl are overthinking it and trying to act like they’re “above the hype” or thinking physical tools matter. Even if he barely improves his skill, he’s a dominating inside presence and there’s more than a negligible difference between him and the cheap, replacement-level ones you can get in FA."
2336,2020-04-19 02:09:16,g3uzw6,">How will you do your draft board if/when the one and done rule is abolished?

Thank you! I always see ppl say they don’t value HS tape or something along those lines and I think it’s such a cop-out. In reality they just don’t know how to, or afraid to, glean the value out of them.

They act like it doesn’t count when pretty soon it’s gonna be all you have to go off. Is all of Emoni Bates tape just going to be invalid? And we should just knock him down the boards in favor of “proven” college guys"
2337,2020-04-18 23:31:37,g3uzw6,"Yeah he is in a top 5 euro team,so basically the 35th best team in the world,which tbh the 5 best euro teams could beat the Warriors without Curry and Dray."
2338,2020-04-19 03:02:51,g3uzw6,"Do you know why he played so few minutes those three games?

 I looked and he wasn’t even in foul trouble (maybe one game but I don’t think so)"
2339,2020-04-19 02:31:44,g3uzw6,"Yeah exactly, is this guy taking Bosh, Melo, Wade, Darko, etc. ahead of LeBron cuz there’s only high school tape?"
2340,2020-04-19 03:06:14,g3uzw6,The first two games they won by ~40 and the Oregon game he was in a bit of foul trouble iirc.
2341,2020-04-19 04:26:44,g3uzw6,"That's a fair point. I don't think it's fair, however, to be comparing LeBron and James Wiseman. Wiseman is nowhere near the level of prospect where you can just bet on his high school tape. Emoni Bates? Yes."

2394,2020-04-18 20:52:24,g3u24h,I agree and the fact it’s called one world really doesn’t help with it feeling self indulgent like it feels like almost a reference back to the OneLove concert back in 2017 except that wasn’t self indulgent it was for the victims of the terrorist attack. It just feels wrong imo.

2399,2020-04-19 01:45:12,g3u24h,"Lady Gaga’s net worth is over 275 million. Jack Dorsey literally gave away a quarter of his wealth, 1 billion dollars. 25% directly to relief programs for corona virus. 

It’s great that anyone is donating or making contributions. 

It’s great that she *helped raise* $35m, which is phenomenal.  

But I also wonder how much she has contributed herself. 35 million is a fuckton of money and that is less than 13% of what she has. 

Does she owe a fuck ton to others? No. Of course not.... but considering the wealth disparity and that this is literally life and death for so many- I would hope there was more done than organizing a concert. 

Because also- how much has been spent on adverts? how much is actually going to the places that need it? Is there transparency on this? Are artists and their agents genuinely not getting anything from this? 

How much have those multi-millionaires or near billionaires artists donated? A collective group of artists that have billionaires of dollars only raise 35 million? Paul McCartney alone is worth 1.2 billion, Swift 360 million, Elton John 450 million....

It’s just hard to feel it’s not self indulgent and in a weird way self promoting. 

It also just feels sketchy giving to the WHO after the way the WHO has acted. 

HOWEVER If the net results is at least some money gets to the place it should be, it’s a net positive BUT the whole thing still bothers me."
2400,2020-04-19 01:18:21,g3u24h,"Making [masks ](https://imgur.com/a/KxTgkxq) with slot for hepa filters, delivering them to extra vulnerable and those who I know need them but cant find any.

Purchasing and donating dog food to the two local animal shelters along with extra bedding. 

Dropped off extra bags of disposable gloves for staff at local grocery store because I had what I need and they could use extra.

Not on a billionaires level or anything like Jack Dorsey- but in ways I can, I’m giving back. 

And to be clear: I think stating all this is gauche- because even if someone just calls to check in on their friend in isolation, that is a step to helping others. 

Responsibly taking only what you need from the grocery store is a way of respecting others. 

Not everyone is going to be in a position to do massive grand gestures so little things like those are the things that make a difference.

However, if a rich person, such as Gaga, was expected to donate a decent amount of their wealth every single time some kind of issue was raised, they would eventually run out of money so a person should not be expected to donate, for example, 10% of their wealth every single time a disaster happens. Sure, it’s great if they do, but it’s not sustainable for that person. 

Now, as far as Jack Dorsey. He set aside 1 billion in Square stock that he owns towards a “fund” to help with coronavirus and other such causes, so in my own opinion that should not be considered the same as that is not a liquid cash donation directly to help a cause. It’s essentially another Bill and Melinda Gates foundation. Which, sure, is great, but when will the results of this be seen? We don’t know.

So, the fact that someone used their actual influence to pressure companies such as Google to donate liquid cash, upwards of 35 million, is impressive.

This current effort that she set up is kind of being considered as a modern day Live Aid, which raised 127 million at that time. Viewers who are financially stable during this time are asked to donate. These artists, such as Gaga, could have purchased this advertising herself. Or, the stations could have done all of this pro bono. We don’t know. From a marketing aspect, the cost of the advertisements were most likely less than what they would bring in from additional donations brought in from people who saw the marketing. I’m in marketing. They wouldn’t have paid for ads if the costs would have outweighed the potential income.

I guess my point is, why so cynical? Funds are being brought in by this to help the cause. My view is, as long as applicable funds are being brought in, we shouldn’t fret too much about the details. People need the help and the government isn’t quite doing that for us."
2403,2020-04-19 01:33:47,g3u24h,Thanks for your service. I did pretty similar thing. And I feel so appreciated and encouraged by this concert. I don’t know why you have so much hatred when they are doing the same thing using their influence and things they are good. I hope you can appreciate others’ effort when others are appreciating you.
2404,2020-04-19 01:43:32,g3u24h,"I respect your opinion but call others’ effort bullsh*t is so careless. You said you deliver face masks to others, now imagine instead of appreciation they said face mask is total useless and call your good will bullsh*t, how would you feel."
2405,2020-04-19 01:50:37,g3u24h,"It’s not hatred per se, but revulsion. 

And it’s revulsion because it doesn’t feel sincere, it feels self promotional. Like capitalizing on the pandemic for their own ego or attention. 

Just the fact that out of the collective billions- seriously billions- all those artists collectively have raised in 35 million ... but somehow singing makes it helpful?  

Meanwhile people like  Jack Dorsey or Rihanna or others have done, or Bob Kraft flying his own jet to get 1.7 million masks for nurses in the US... this concert and “celebrity support” feels empty and insincere. 

If people take joy from it, then I am happy for it. Just because I find it gross doesn’t mean others can’t find beauty in it or enjoy. Lol hence unpopular opinion. 💕"
2406,2020-04-19 01:53:42,g3u24h,"But I’m not showing up at their house to sing them a song and then expect them to appreciate it. 

That’s a more accurate comparison. 

If these celebs all said “I’m doing this and donating 5 million. I’m donating 700 boxes of PPE to city X. I’m buying groceries for all people in Tallahasse. I’m paying for all peoples medications in Glasgow”. Sure. Great. 

But they’re not. They’re going on TV and singing a song. It just feels fake to me."
2407,2020-04-19 01:57:47,g3u24h,I’m just here to tell you why it’s unpopular. Just because these artists appear on this concert doesn’t mean they didn’t help others in others ways. And I always feel sick about the idea that billionaire donating millions is kind of empty or selfish since they should donate more.
2408,2020-04-19 02:00:14,g3u24h,"They are singers! They do what they are good at. You saw the video of Italian musicians play music on street to cheer people up, and how they are appreciated? I don’t call that empty or fake, I call them heroes."
2409,2020-04-19 02:03:22,g3u24h,"I think we actually have kind of similar views but I just happen to take issue with a concert that you like. Which I entirely understand! 

I just think there could be more but at the end of the day, as I wrote elsewhere - it’s there’s even slight net positive, it’s a win. And I hope that it’s not just done for self service but truly for others. 

And thank you for your service too. You say you did something similar and that’s awesome. 

I hope you and your loved ones are all safe and well."
2410,2020-04-19 02:06:29,g3u24h,Thank you for your service too and stay safe.

Ryan O'Reilly (only the defending Stanley Cup champion Conn Smythe MVP and Selke winner, why are you continually snubbing him while you keep loading up Cali players past their primes? This is just insane he doesn't have a top card out already, just a lowly 91 that's not even available so we only really have his 88. Apparently being the champs and best defending fwd and mvp doesn't mean crap. u/eaJacks can you pretty please get us a great card for thest best all-round player in the league 2 years running?).

Gonchar

Chara

Larry Murphy

Duncan Keith 

Pavel Bure (ok I know you don't have the rights but just get creative. Call him Russ N. Rocket. He will be all 99's in every category or else you did him wrong).

Martin Pierre Brodeur (see Bure above, name: Marty P. Brody and he will be the only player ever to break the limit and be 100 in every category because let's face it, he's perfection)

99 Joel Hofer (just cause!)

Karlsson upgrade to his FB 94.

2502,2020-04-17 21:11:55,g3aeb6,It’s his 91 FB card.
2503,2020-04-17 21:06:18,g3aeb6,"I just have my tips on and manual defend shots with my biggest guys, it gives you a check mark when you complete it."
2504,2020-04-17 21:54:07,g3aeb6,That's completely understandable.  Patience is a virtue so hopefully the wait will be worth it!
2505,2020-04-17 23:16:36,g3aeb6,Will he be in the next event? Lots of HUT players are excited to build a higher version.
2506,2020-04-18 05:36:18,g3aeb6,Ooooh I like the sound of that! Cool! Does this go for Datysuk as well then?
2507,2020-04-17 21:05:03,g3aeb6,Yeah and Gretzky and Mario had 95's already and we all still wanted to upgrade to their 99's yesterday.  Lol what's your point?
2508,2020-04-17 21:10:40,g3aeb6,Yeah this is dumb. You should be able to use their primetime as well. I don't understand this logic.
2509,2020-04-17 22:33:06,g3aeb6,Have both of em 😂
2510,2020-04-17 22:59:54,g3aeb6,Fucking right
2511,2020-04-17 21:29:57,g3aeb6,But the longer we have to wait the bettter the card will be👍🏼
2512,2020-04-17 21:05:10,g3aeb6,I JUST LOST MY SHIT
2513,2020-04-17 21:40:23,g3aeb6,Still love the card but the fact that all the other MSPs are getting upgraded makes it frustrating. Thought this would be the perfect event for it.
2514,2020-04-17 21:27:46,g3aeb6,"We've done both as PT's already this month, but can look for other opportunities to feature them."
2515,2020-04-17 21:27:06,g3aeb6,Thank u
2516,2020-04-17 21:06:42,g3aeb6,Hopefully MSP next event otherwise he’d only be a 97.
2517,2020-04-17 21:09:39,g3aeb6,I'd rather see the limited amount of upgrades we get go to players who are still below 90. I'm sure you're sitting on a couple 93 Zetterbergs. EDIT: haha that's exactly what you did
2518,2020-04-17 22:39:42,g3aeb6,Did you still have the dynamic duos ones to do the upgrades!?
2519,2020-04-18 02:38:05,g3aeb6,Hey just wanted to say thank you. About a month ago I made a thread about Brisebois' SSA being criminally low. I only noticed now you guys bumped it to 80! Thanks for listening
2520,2020-04-17 21:29:47,g3aeb6,I have bought both already believe me lol but anything you can do would be great man thanks for everything!
2521,2020-04-17 21:33:33,g3aeb6,I’d rather see it go to zetterberg too and I don’t even own one
2522,2020-04-18 01:35:10,g3aeb6,HELL NO. This is madness. I have the 90 OVR PRIMETIMES for both
2523,2020-04-30 14:53:07,g36vwr,Nice it worked for me

2584,2020-04-13 20:09:36,g0q990,I unfortunately don’t think Delpit is falling that far
2585,2020-04-13 20:54:37,g0q990,"The only thing the mock drafts have taught me this year is that Leki Fotu is going to be a Steeler. It’s like it’s illegal to leave him off a Pittsburgh mock. 

That said, I like PFN draft best out of this set"
2586,2020-04-13 21:52:24,g0q990,"I think the PFF draft would have to be considered sort of a dream scenario.

But as usual, PFF has no idea how to value guys, so it's also the least likely of them all to be anything approaching possible."
2587,2020-04-13 21:25:16,g0q990,"I agree with sliding Edmunds into a hybrid role- he's good at run support and should be able to cover backs/TEs better than Barron did.

I think when it comes to WR, they are going to look for that elusive ""big"" WR. I think Cain at 6'2"" is the tallest we have? I do like the Pittman Jr (or G-G) pick, but knowing the Steelers they'll probably wait and get a guy like Guidry (Miss. St), Hodgins (Ore. St), or Patmon (Wash. St)."
2588,2020-04-13 20:00:36,g0q990,Some of these have a *uniquely optimistic perspective* on likely draft stock for certain players.
2589,2020-04-13 20:31:05,g0q990,Delpit is a beast. I’ll honestly be surprised to see him fall there.
2590,2020-04-13 22:28:24,g0q990,"Most of these are very good for us, but if we got 2 or 5 I’d nut that value is insane"
2591,2020-04-15 21:19:22,g0q990,I'd nut at getting Delpit at 49. Then we could try Edmunds at ILB maybe.
2592,2020-04-13 20:26:46,g0q990,"I think any full mock anybody does should have a S in it, that is the shallowest position on the team right now. That being said I don't think Delpit is a Steelers safety, the Steelers look for tacklers and defensive backs in general who can when called stop the run or be a sure tackle and Delpit is not that."
2593,2020-04-14 00:47:39,g0q990,I do not think ILB is a major need but holy shit pairing Murray with Bush on the interior of that LB corps is hard to pass up at that pick.
2594,2020-04-13 20:22:47,g0q990,if he does fall i think it’s a solid pick
2595,2020-04-13 20:13:13,g0q990,"Totally agree, however if he’s sitting there I expect the Steelers to draft him."
2596,2020-04-17 01:39:58,g0q990,Definitely. No way Murray makes it to 49 and highly unlikely that Peoples-Jones would be there in the 4th. Would be stoked to get both though and they are SPARQ guys.
2597,2020-04-13 20:14:21,g0q990,Such as?
2598,2020-04-15 21:22:00,g0q990,As would I. Best case scenario in my mind
2599,2020-04-13 21:18:01,g0q990,"I would agree with that.  However,  the drafts depth at typical year first round pick talent is very high at tackle and wide receiver.  Therefore,  I expect a much higher likelihood of having bpa at oline or receiver than a defensive player."
2600,2020-04-13 21:19:46,g0q990,Hoping Ruiz falls or Austin Jackson
2601,2020-04-13 21:23:13,g0q990,"Is that falling for Ruiz?  I’m not sure on his draft stock.

Austin Jackson might be the only player in the draft I’d consider trading up for.  The free agent tackle market has gotten insane.  I would not be shocked if Villanueva runs 15-18 next year.  Getting Jackson this year so we don’t have to pay Villanueva would be a huge coup.

Tackles don’t fall in the draft especially one who I believe is very young with above average starter athleticism.  

My guess he’s a first round pick but I highly doubt he gets out of the first ten picks in second round.  

If Jackson’s available with our pick you either take him or you trade the pick to a team that wants a tackle and gives a ton for your pick.  Some good players will fall.  I doubt it’s him."
2602,2020-04-13 04:31:34,g0a662,"Congrats man. You be you. Just keep sayin it your way and doing it your way.

Aside from that, people just (IMO) are trying to relate, or picture you the way they can or know how. It’s about THEIR limited vision. Not yours. Most things people say are a reflection of themselves.

I still think Arnette will be much better than people think, but I get that there's a feeling nobody but the Raiders wanted him that high so there was no need to take him there.

Baffled about Epenesa falling, I know they love measurables and all, but just watch that dude play football- he is a grown ass man and will show it from day one IMO.

Ravens getting Dobbins and Duvernay is just sick-  I felt like I was in the Twilight Zone pre-draft due to the lack of mention of him in all the WR stuff being talked about, watch his tape, he can do everything- I see Deebo Samuel all over again with that guy. Tough as hell for a WR"

2647,2020-04-29 14:32:42,gaa0n8,"# Biggest steals: 

&#x200B;

**Ceedee Lamb, WR, OU (17th-DAL)**

I already talked a little bit about this one. To me there was no way Jerry Jones would let a star receiver from nearby like Lamb stay on the board and possibly allow the division-rival Eagles to pick him up. Yes, they had bigger needs, but Lamb was the top player available at that point (my eight overall prospect) and that offense – which already ranked number one in total yardage – just went to a different level. Sliding Lamb in at X and moving Amari Cooper more into the slot, where he can avoid press-coverage from guys like Stephon Gilmore and Jalen Ramsey, who gave him some trouble last season, helps everybody. Still, number 19 is one of the most savvy route-runners in the league and if you throw in third-year guy Michael Gallup, who might have had the most quiet 1000-yard season I can ever remember, you have an elite receiver. 

&#x200B;

**A.J. Epenesa, Edge, Iowa (54th-BUF)**

With this one, I kind of get why it happened, but I just don’t agree. Before the 2019 season Epenesa was looked at as an eventual top-ten pick and even a few months ago, I thought he was a first-round lock, but with sub-par athletic testing, he clearly wasn’t very appealing to NFL clubs. At the combine, the Iowa D-lineman couldn’t crack the five-second mark in the 40 and put up modest numbers across the board, but put on the tape and tell me this guy isn’t worth a first-round pick. No, he is not as explosive as a Chase Young or can bend like K’Lavon Chaisson from LSU, but Epenesa has the natural strength to hold his ground in the run game against pretty much anybody, is already very advanced with his hand-usage and can straight up drive guys back into the quarterback’s lap. I think he will immediately start across from Jerry Hughes at D-end and be a mismatch versus guards on third downs.

&#x200B;

**Kristian Fulton, CB, LSU (61st overall-TEN)**

I heard before the draft started that Fulton could drop a little bit in the draft, but I thought he would still go in the late first or early second. Instead he slid all the way down to the end of round two and I think the Titans were very lucky to land him. Fulton was my number three corner in the draft, pretty clearly ahead of guys like Clemson’s A.J. Terrell and Ohio State’s Damon Arnette, who went number 16 and 19 respectively. I get why they would covet the two more than Fulton potentially, but he was my 23rd overall prospect for a reason. His ability to mirror receivers off the line and stay in their hip pocket, combined with the fluid lower body to adjust in zone coverage are all excellent. He might not be super-interested in tackling, but we have seen other guys like that go a lot higher.

&#x200B;

**Josh Jones, OT, Houston (72nd-ARZ)**

One of the most surprising developments in the draft to me was the fall of the Houston offensive tackle. Jones was 25th overall on my big board as the clear-cut number five tackle and with teams like the Dolphins, Seahawks, Titans and Vikings in that range, I definitely thought one of those teams would pick him up. Even after that, with Cincinnati making that first selection of day two and all the other teams mentioned having him available in round two, there was no way I saw him be there in the third round. Jones’ pass set need some work, but he gets after people in the run game and he has a punch in protection that can stun pass-rushers. After selecting Clemson do-it-all freak defender Isaiah Simmons eight overall and using that second-rounder in a trade for superstar receiver DeAndre Hopkins from Houston, grabbing Jones at that point as a likely day one starter at right tackle is outstanding.

&#x200B;

**Adam Trautman, TE, Dayton (105th-NO)**

Okay, let’s start like this – Trautman was my top-rated tight-end and a mid-day two prospect on my list, so the value isn’t through the roof quite like it is with some of the guys I have with these next few names. However, when you look at the fact that he was the fifth player at the position to hear his name called and guys like Josiah Deguara and Dalton Keene being two of the earlier ones, getting him with the second-to-last pick on day two is surprising. Trautman is an aggressive blocker, who can secure the edge for Alvin Kamara, and not only can he win above the rim but he also takes guys for a ride with the ball in his hands. I know the Saints traded away their day three capital for the tight-end, but their roster was already pretty stacked and they needed impact players over depth. So I don’t disagree with that strategy.

&#x200B;

**Bryce Hall, CB, Virginia (158th-NYJ)**

I didn’t want to talk too much about players who dropped solely based on injury, but Hall is not coming off a recent injury, having ankle surgery all the way back in October, and I believe NFL decision-makers didn’t fall in love of him because of what they perceive as average athleticism. Hall has a nice frame, shows excellent football IQ and instincts to go with great ball-skills for the position. I don’t think he would have stood out at the combine with the way he ran or jumped, but he has more than adequate tools for the secondary. Picking a guy like that up in the fifth round when he was the 65th overall prospect on my board is a gift for the Jets and Gregg Williams as their defensive coordinator. I would not be surprised if he started for them by mid-season.

&#x200B;

**Nick Harris, IOL, Washington (160th-CLE)**

Similar to some other guys on this list, I know why front-offices passed on this guy until the fifth round, but I just disagree. Harris may not be the strongest offensive lineman and you can argue that he is a center-only prospect, but I had a third-round grade on him because I see what he can excel at rather than looking at some snaps where is one-on-one with a 330-pound nose tackle, who can drive him backwards in protection. Harris has outstanding agility and ability to get on the move to puts on people. In that zone-based scheme Kevin Stefanski is bringing over from Minnesota, he is just a perfect fit. I would not be shocked if Harris replaces veteran J.C. Tretter, who they have a potential out on in 2021, after bulking up a little through an NFL training program.  


**Bradlee Anae, Edge, Utah (179th-DAL)**

This might be the biggest steal of the entire draft. I was totally baffled as to why Anae continue to slide down the board. He was my 67th overall prospect and he went over a hundred spots later without any apparent reason. Yes, his arm length isn’t optimal and he is a not the most dynamic athlete, but he is so much better right now than some of the developmental edge rushers that were selected ahead of him. The former Ute has a nasty cross-chop combo and he can really convert speed to power in order to force quarterbacks off the spot. He had 13 sacks last season against what quietly was some pretty good tackle competition in the Pac-12. In my write-up for the positional rankings I compared him to a little taller Brandon Graham.

&#x200B;

**Donovan Peoples-Jones, WR, Michigan (187th-CLE)**

Once again, here we have a player I had exactly a hundred spots higher than where he actually went off the board. Peoples-Jones never put up big numbers for that Michigan offense and there are some things he needs to clean up about his route-running, but that lack of production had a lot to do with very poor quarterback play and the talent is undeniable. He had one of the most impressive all-around combines, running 4.48 in the 40 at 212 pounds and he just jumped out of the gym. DPJ can work the entire field and he adjusts beautifully to the ball in the air. To me his best fit would be in the slot, where Cleveland already has Jarvis Landry, but he might already be the third-most talented receiver on that roster and should be much more productive as a pro.

&#x200B;

**Eno Benjamin, RB, Arizona St. (222nd-ARZ)**

I have no idea how this one happened. I knew I was a lot higher on Benjamin than most people, having him as my number six running back and the 78th overall prospect, but for him to be 15th player at the position to hear his name called in the final round of the draft is absurd. The former Sun Devil tends to dance around in the backfield a little too much and his fumbles went up quite a bit last season – which was largely due to exchange problems with his freshman quarterback – but I’m a big fan. Benjamin is a violent runner with explosive jump-cuts to make defenders miss but also the attitude to bury his facemask into the chest of defenders to finish runs. Kenyan Drake was tremendous for the Cardinals when they brought him in last season, but Eno could easily put up 500 yards from scrimmage and churn away some games."
2648,2020-04-29 15:33:56,gaa0n8,"As a Browns fan, completely agree that our draft checked most of our boxes. Very nice blend of BPA and drafting for need, and the late-round picks could be solid contributors for us due to the scheme.

I feel way better about this offseason than I did this time last year. (I was one of the only people on r/Browns questioning Kitchens and the OBJ trade)"
2649,2020-04-29 14:27:49,gaa0n8,"IMO

biggest winner: **Broncos**

Drew Lock showed potential of being their saving grace at QB and filled the holes on this team. Albert O,Hamler and Jeudy will complement Sutton and give them more options on offense and improved the offensive line with Cushenberry and Muti. On defense they added someone on each level of the defense.

biggest loser: **Packers**

The window is nearly closing and needed to give Rodgers something to get over the 49ers hump. They instead looked upon the future. Controversial but understandable in a way, but Packers might not be serious contenders this next year.

&#x200B;

biggest reach: **Damon Arnette**

Arnette was picked ahead of Kristian Fulton, Noah Igbinoghene, Jeff Gladney, Jaylon Johnson and Trevon Diggs. Arnette was more of a late 2nd and was drafted at 19.

&#x200B;

Biggest steal: **Bradlee Anea**

Cowboys needed an EDGE guy and Anea kept falling for some reason. He could end up a starter for the cowboys"
2650,2020-04-29 17:34:20,gaa0n8,"Great write up.  Just wanted to clarify one thing:

>Lloyd Cushenberry, who was my 35th overall prospect in the draft and should immediately compete for the starting spot at right guard next to recently acquired Graham Glasgow

They view Glasgow as a G, so Cush will most likely be our starting Center.  Risner, Cush, Glasgow is an interior line that I'm very comfortable with."
2651,2020-04-29 15:11:25,gaa0n8,"A lot of great work here. As a Bears fan, the “they have 10 TE’s” story is getting a bit strung out. The TE position is very important in Matt Nagys offense and last year they had historically bad TE production. So they looked far and wide to create competition at the position. Old (Graham) and new (Kmet) and everything in between to try and rebuild that room. At most, 4 make the roster. The number of TE’s is all about competition and getting the best out of the position."

2655,2020-05-01 00:12:48,gaa0n8,"Winners- I thought the first 17 picks were fantastic for each team, everyone got their wish list filled

Losers- packers grabbing backups the first 3 rounds, and trading up for love giving up their 4th. So basically thru 4 rounds they took 3 backups and didn’t address receiver or front seven defense.  I could understand if love fell to them, but to trade up makes no sense especially since aaron Rodgers isn’t going anywhere anytime soon, and love was considered a raw project 

Winners- Vikings and Baltimore really hit it out of the park with sensible picks that fits needs. Didn’t reach for needs but let the board fall as it may and still landed what they needed.

Losers- Fromm and Eason,  seen much less talented QBs go in the 2nd n 3rd rounds

Winners- browns, took a solid player in each round, from top to bottom I think they may have had the best draft considering the value and positions they were able to land.

Losers- titans, for a team looking to make a super bowl run, i think they reached for Isiah wilson in round 1 and really had an underwhelming draft in general. A good impactful draft class and they can make a serious playoff run next year

Loser and winner-  raiders, taking Ruggs was good, and arnette fits what they wanted to do and with no 2nd round pick they grabbed him when they could. Didn’t like the back to back WR picks in the 3rd.  I think it was overkill for them to load up on 3 receivers in their first 4 picks, could have taken 2 and grabbed a 3rd wr on day 3"
2656,2020-04-29 15:53:23,gaa0n8,"Patrick Queen and Jordyn Brooks aren't close to the same type of player, so why would Queen being on the board have anything to do with the Brooks pick?"
2657,2020-04-29 18:34:42,gaa0n8,as a dolphins fan I agree 100% with your analysis
2658,2020-04-29 21:32:21,gaa0n8,"I think people are missing the point on the Raiders draft. My guess is that they’re ecstatic over it. 

They covered their biggest need - a second and third cornerback. And they now have the tools to be a totally diversified offense."
2659,2020-04-30 00:19:14,gaa0n8,"Not that AZ hasn't already received enough praise, but you can't leave out the most obvious winners"
2660,2020-04-30 17:29:38,gaa0n8,"Why you have alton Robinson over taylor? Just wondering. Also I'm not too worried about everybody trashing pit draft, cant really judge a draft till years later haha"
2661,2020-05-01 15:02:59,gaa0n8,"1) The attacks on AJ Dillon really bother me. It seems like nothing more than group think, because nobody can tell me why they didn't have AJ Dillon higher. He is a proven RB that is unique in this class at 247 lbs (and overall, there are very few RBs that big), who was also extremely athletic (4.53 40 among and had the 2nd highest RAS score of any RB IIRC) and he has been durable. Sure, he wasn't used in the passing game that much, but he caught enough passes and showed that he has solid hands/route running at the Combine. People compare Dillon to Henry, but Dillon is more athletic by just about every metric and Henry went #45 Overall compared to Dillon's #62 Overall. Dillon's tape was also very good, bursting through holes quickly and throwing guys around like ragdolls. So remind me again why the low 2nd Round is a reach...

2) You put loser for Aaron Rodgers, but lets look at it a different way. This is a Winner for HC Matt LaFleur. After the Packers spent years of heavy drafting for the Defense, LaFleur was able to get his Franchise QB of the future and he was able to get guys to implement his scheme. He is de-emphasizing the WR position and emphasizing the running game. The TE/h-back in Deguara allows the versatility out of the backfield to maintain balance out of the I-formation, and Dillon allows LaFleur to punish Defenses that go light. Dillon also improves the situational Offense for both the redzone and short yardage, both of which the Packers were bad at last year. Then he got what will probably work out to be a developmental RT in Jon Runyan, a developmental C in Jake Hanson and a development OG in Simon Stepaniak. This is a big win for Matt LaFleur."
2662,2020-05-03 04:23:09,gaa0n8,"Little late to this, but have to agree that the Ravens absolutely killed this draft.  DeCosta has done a hell of a job stepping into Ozzie's shoes."
2663,2020-05-03 16:51:44,gaa0n8,Agreed it’s all arbitrary needless banter that won’t mean anything until the players get on the field.
2664,2020-04-29 14:31:22,gaa0n8,"# Biggest reaches: 

&#x200B;

**Justin Herbert, QB, Oregon (6th-LAC)**

I already called Tyrod Taylor one of the biggest losers from draft weekend and talked about some of the things I disagreed with the Chargers on with some of the decisions they made, but let me get into a little more detail about their new rookie quarterback. Herbert has prototype measurements and with his arm talent, the upside is tremendously high. I just don’t know if he will ever reach it. He started almost four years with the Ducks and simply never really improved. Yes, the numbers looked pretty good last season, but when you look at the offense, the coaches didn’t ask a lot of him. It was a bunch of screens and rail routes off those. I like that he has experience in heavy play-action and some of the spectacular throws he can make, but Herbert is kind of a one-read quarterback who doesn’t see the field particularly well. He was my 37th overall prospect and I thought he should have gone more in that Jordan Love range as a developmental QB.

&#x200B;

**Damon Arnette, CB, Ohio State (19th-LV)**

Just like they did last year, the Raiders delivered the shocker of the night when they selected the second corner from the Buckeyes. I had not seen Arnette in any mock drafts since early in the process and I don’t think he was worth that pick. He was my tenth-ranked cornerback and the 66th overall prospect on my board. I like the competitive and physical style of play, but when I look at the Vikings being able to trade down six spots and collect draft capital while still being able to grab TCU’s Jeff Gladney with the second-to-last pick in round one just makes this look bad. I don’t even mind Arnette being the guy they want to target, because I think if there was never anything off the field, he would have probably been talked about more, but Mike Mayock & company could have definitely traded down a few spots and still gotten the Ohio State corner. The next guy at the position was selected at number 30 overall by the Dolphins and even he was a surprise pick.

&#x200B;

**Jordyn Brooks, LB, Texas Tech (27th-SEA)**

I weirdly have Brooks 28 spots lower than Arnette even, but we at least heard some stuff about him potentially sneaking into the late first round, plus Seattle always grabs a guy who isn’t looked at like that. Usually they at least trade down however and to me value just doesn’t add up. The Texas Tech backer ranked eight at the position for me and in the 90s overall – actually behind Michigan State’s Joe Bachie, who falsely went undrafted. I’m sure they love the way Brooks can run and his aggressive style of play, but I have questions about the way he can work through blocking and show awareness in zone coverage, which they ask a lot of from their linebackers to cover ground. I could absolutely see him work out if he takes over for K.J. Wright once they can’t pay him anymore, but the 27th pick on a guy like that is a little rich for me, especially when LSU’s Patrick Queen goes to Baltimore right after that.

&#x200B;

**Isaiah Wilson, OT, Georgia (29th-TEN)**

Similarly to Brooks, I wasn’t surprised at all to see Wilson get selected in the first round and I actually had him go to the Seahawks two picks earlier in my mock draft. Both those teams would have made a lot of sense for the massive Georgia tackle in a run-heavy offense, but I just don’t see him being the type of player worth a high pick like that. Wilson actually didn’t quite make my top 100 list and while I see the upside for a guy like that as an oldschool power right tackle, I’m not even sure if he has the agility to survive on the outside against true speed rushers. I talked about how Tennessee would look at tackle in my mock, because until Thursday it looked like the void left by Jack Conklin leaving would result in a battle between Dennis Kelly and Ty Sambrailo for RT. So Wilson can definitely be an upgrade at that spot, but not for the price of a first-round pick.

&#x200B;

**A.J. Dillon, RB, Boston College (62nd-GB)**

I already discussed the Packers draft class and how they screwed over Aaron Rodgers with zero wide receivers being selected and obviously trading up a few spots for their future quarterback Jordan Love, but let’s talk more about the second-rounder. Dillon is an out-of-date 250-pound bruiser, who had a great career at Boston College, but I don’t think his success will quite translate to the next level. Watching him he simply does not have the footwork to adjust on the fly, if he can’t build up momentum, he just isn’t very effective and he was a non-factor in the pass-game with 21 career receptions. I get that LaFleur looks at him as a similar player to Derrick Henry, but I don’t think those two are in the same class, and Green Bay already kind of has that tyoe of back in Jamaal Williams, who has done more on passing down. Dillon was my RB14 and certainly had a day three grade.

&#x200B;

**Jacob Phillips, LB, LSU (97th-CLE)** 

You know that I thought the Browns really killed the draft, but I probably hated no other pick more than this guy. From the outside, drafting the leading tackler of an undefeated National Championship team doesn’t sound too bad, but I probably watched some kind of LSU tape 50 times to evaluate all those other guys and Phillips never flashed for me. He can run pretty well, but that’s about it. He is conservative against the run, gets hung up with blocks and is content with drag-tackles. There were at least 13 other Tigers I liked better than Phillips and he wasn’t even one my top 20 linebackers. One pick later their division rival Ravens selected my LB6 in Ohio State’s Malik Harrison, who plays downhill and tested pretty much the same. That is just ridiculous to me.

&#x200B;

**Dalton Keene, TE, Virginia Tech (101st-NE)**

Don’t get me wrong here. I actually like Keene, because of the work he puts in as a run-blocker with the flexibility to line up at H-back or fullback, and I think he was heavily underutilized as a pass-catcher for the Hokies, especially with how physical he is with the ball in his hands. With that being said, he only had 59 career receptions in three years with Virginia Tech and only ran a couple of routes in college. Not only was my TE1 in Dayton’s Adam Trautman still on the board, but they actually traded away their two fourth-round selections to the divisional rival Jets. With picks 125 and 129 Gang Green selected FIU quarterback James Morgan, who I like as a developmental player and was often linked to New England, in Charlotte offensive lineman Cameron Clarke who has the tools to become an excellent sixth lineman at the very least.

&#x200B;

**Davion Taylor, LB, Colorado (103rd-PHI)**

Another guy I thought went too early solely based on traits is the former Colorado linebacker. Taylor can absolutely fly and you see that ability to run with guys down the seams, but he basically played big nickel for the Buffs and never had to make actual linebacker reads. He is really explosive and you see him chase down some receivers from behind on tape, but he is just such a raw player, only having played one game in high school and he looks kind of lost in coverage, allowing a passer rating of 139.3 and being responsible for five touchdowns last season. If you are looking for an undersized backer who can run around but actually has put really good play on tape, how about App State’s Akeem Davis-Gaither, who was the first name on day three and my 62nd overall prospect.

&#x200B;

**Justin Rohrwasser, K, Marshall (159th-NE)**

Alright, time to hate on some specialists. I already admitted it – I don’t really watch kickers and I had never even heard of this guy before the weekend. So I won’t even act like I can evaluate the pick, but when I look at several other rankings, the consensus was that he wasn’t even a top five kicker in this draft and Georgia’s Rodrigo Blankenship went undrafted for example. If you select him in the seventh round, I can’t hate it – even though I would like to think nobody else would have selected them otherwise, but to spend a fifth on a kicker from Marshall nobody has ever even heard of seems crazy to me. Especially when you look at some of the other guys who went a few spots behind him, like Washington center Nick Harris, Wisconsin wide receiver Quintez Cephus and Georgia quarterback Jake Fromm.

&#x200B;

**Blake Ferguson, LS, LSU (185th-MIA)** 

I mean, I actually knew him by name. But … drafting long-snappers is a thing? And at the top of the sixth round? When Alohi Gilman and Donovan Peoples-Jones were the next two picks? I’m not sure."

2666,2020-04-29 22:36:53,gaa0n8,Ravens had the best draft hands down. And I wouldn’t say the Jets are winners. They have a lot of boom or bust picks so this could easily be another typical Jets draft without a single long term starter picked.
2667,2020-04-30 10:19:32,gaa0n8,"Another ""BeArS hAvE 10 TeS"" hot take but fail to realize that majority will be cut and the main reason there is 10 is because we had a ton of injuries to that position requiring more players to be brought in."
2668,2020-05-02 20:06:29,gaa0n8,"1) The way OP and some others phrase the Chargers trade back into the 1st round is so disingenuous. The Chargers didn’t really trade both of their day 2 picks. The Chargers ONLY gave up their 3rd round pick to turn their 2nd round pick into a 1st round pick. So the Chargers still had their 2nd round pick, it just became a 1st rounder. The value matches up perfectly with any trade value chart out there. And they did it to get arguably the best *true* LB in the entire draft class who will fit perfectly in Gus Bradley’s defense. 

2) The Chargers didn’t draft any OL, but they did add Bulaga, Iowa, and Trai Turner during the off-season. They’re also getting Mike Pouncey back, who was out for most of the year. The Chargers OL should be much improved."
2669,2020-04-29 23:30:53,gaa0n8,"Agree with most everything except the pats being losers. 

According to reports. Carolina was poised to take Dugger with the next pick in the draft (38). He’s got great size, a 6’6 wingspan and was a top performer at the combine. It’s not hard to argue him having the most upside of any DB in the draft not named Jeff. Granted his floor is similarly low considering he’s coming from a d2 program, but I’m always happy with the home run swing when drafting.

The Keene trade was questionable both the cost and the pick, but I’m very happy with the rest of the class. Owenwu could be a steal. Asiasi and Uche have huge upside. Jennings should contribute right away. Rowrwasser was 13-13 on 4th quarter fgs including one from 53 to win the game in the rain. Belichik has drafted 1 other kicker in the last 20 years and he’s currently the all time point leader in NFL history. Everyone scoffed when Bill took Gostkowski in the 4th just like you are now. Before that he (along with parcels) took the guy currently 2nd all time in points scored (vinetari). Probably safe to defer to bills judgement on kickers considering he’s been apart of drafting 2 of the best all time with his last 2 attempts.

Bill certainly isn’t an elite drafter, but he’s better than your giving him credit for. Wynn and Harry were both injured in training camp to start their careers. Wynn had similar issues this year, but when he was playing, he was great. Receivers usually start slow, especially in an offense that’s as complex as the patriots. He basically missed the whole preseason after making a jaw dropping catch and getting hurt in game 1. And Brady was on his way out he didn’t have time to work on catching the rookie up who he’ll never play with again after this season. I fully Harry and Wynn to be excellent players. 

You also failed to mention Sony who was picked 8 slots after Wynn and was arguably the mvp of the superbowl champs during the postseason run his rookie year.

Yes he’s made some horrible picks Aaron Dobson, ras I dowling, Jordan Richards, Terrence Wheatley, come to mind, but your cherry picking with your examples. Cyrus Jones was picked at the end of the 2nd round 60th overall. Derrick rivers was a mid/late 3rd whose also struggled with injuries."
2670,2020-04-30 07:11:33,gaa0n8,"I think your much higher on hamler then alot of people. He really struggled with drops and his routes were not the best. I also think jeudy was not as good as advertised. Didn't match up often against the #1 CB due to either playing in the slot or the #1 following ruggs,smith,waddle. Wasnt very physical and struggled at times with concentration catches. 
I dont believe lock was that big of a winner. 
On the Arnette pick we dont know what's anyone's board looked like nor do we know if the right compensation was available to move down. I think mayock did a great job in the draft as did the cowboys, ravens, titans, Vikings and jags although many of the jags prospects seem boom or bust."
2671,2020-04-29 16:37:14,gaa0n8,"Yeah I like Arnette and like I mentioned, I have no problem if that is there guy, but you need to know the board and the value you could have acquired if you just trade back a little.

Once again, that's just the NFL overthinking a player that doesn't test super well athletically.

Speed and toughness are definitely there with Duvernay! Half of his catches almost were screens though and he didn't show the ability to run a broad route-tree, but I love him in that offense."
2672,2020-05-03 16:50:14,gaa0n8,CBs were going higher all throughout the 1st round so they likely didn't want to take any chances considering they already missed out on Terrell and didn't have a 2nd rounder either.
2673,2020-04-29 20:54:41,gaa0n8,I actually loved the raiders draft
2674,2020-04-30 15:21:07,gaa0n8,"I loved the Raiders draft. Ruggs is a big play waiting to happen every time he's on the field. Arnette is a plug n play CB. Bowden is the perfect player for the spread, his position will be RB but he's expected to also play slot, making him a dangerous motion player. Bryan Edwards is an underrated receiver. He's big and physical and looks to be a safety cushion for Carr. Tanner Muse is going to make an impact on ST from the get-go. At worst he's a career sub LB, at best he becomes a 3-down LB. I don't know much about Simpson but Amik Robertson was one of my favorite players in the draft. He reminds me of better version of Mike Hilton, and Hilton is really good."
2675,2020-04-30 21:01:34,gaa0n8,Same thing happened last year and that turned out just dandy for us.
2676,2020-04-29 16:28:29,gaa0n8,"They are among my ""other questionable drafts"" at the end. Not necessarily a loser, since their two fourth-rounders could have a role and I like the receivers they picked up, but questionable."
2677,2020-04-29 16:29:13,gaa0n8,"Like I mentioned, some of the stuff coming out of Cleveland about they handle things in the front office sounds crazy, but I really like their draft class!"
2678,2020-04-29 14:34:38,gaa0n8,"Agreed with all of them! That's why they all made my list! ;)
I just listed Rodgers, since he was effected more negatively than the team overall in my opinion."
2679,2020-04-29 20:58:12,gaa0n8,"Thanks man! I think all three of those interior guys could actually slide in at center, so that'll definitely be interesting! Either way I really like that trio!"
2680,2020-04-29 15:22:10,gaa0n8,"Thanks!
Oh, I said that as well. The amount of players on the roster right not doesn't matter. It just sounds absurb. Haha
I get that the position is very important for the Nagy offense, especially since if you have a guy that you can flex out wide, he can help out as a coverage-indicator, especially in the RPO game, but Graham is not worth 16 million and Kmet at 43 is a little rich for me, when you look at who else was on the board and where the other TEs went."
2681,2020-04-29 20:56:22,gaa0n8,"Rhule really put his stamp on it! Brown in the first is a dominant force in the middle, Gross-Matos is already a really physical run-defender and has all the tools to become an excellent pass-rusher, Chinn was my safety four - a bit too much of a see-ball get-ball player at this point but super explosive and rangy, Pride is a stick cover-corner I had a day-two grade on, I was surprised to see Robinson not go earlier because he was definitely one of the standouts of the XFL and Roy adds some nice depth or allows you to move Brown around a little - he was one of my draft sleepers (just has T-rex like arms. Haha).

You can listen to my thoughts at the Youtube link!"
2682,2020-04-29 20:58:19,gaa0n8,Thanks a lot!
2683,2020-04-29 22:28:58,gaa0n8,"Haha, a lot of teams got better. Them and the Colts would have been the next two teams I would have put up there. Both won in the Buckner trade in my opinion.

The Niners in particular picked up my number ten overall prospect and got an extra pick by swapping spots with the Bucs and now have a player with the same kind of Buckner in Kinlaw for a fraction of the price when they didn't have the cap space to pay the veteran. So that's definitely smart. I love Aiyuk and he was in that late-first/early-second range for me. Just would have liked to trade down a little possibly and add a pick on day two, but I can't hate getting your guy there. They could dump two contracts from Breida and Goodwin, who they didn't want to pay, even if the compensation wasn't great. Don't really get the McKivitz pick since I don't think there is anyway that he will make the roster with two other quality backup tackles on there right now. Woerner should be their TE3 for heavy personnel sets as a good blocker and Jennings is a man out there - doesn't time well, but plays really physical, especially with the ball in his hands. So nothing that blows me away here after the first round, but getting a Hall of Fame level tackle like Williams to replace another potential HOFer in Staley is obviously a huge win - even if they will have to pay him big-time probably."
2684,2020-05-01 09:33:16,gaa0n8,"I agree with most of these.

Just a couple of notes:
- Deguara will play that fullback/H-back role for the Packers, so he could be somewhat of a starter, but their class definitely leaves a lot to be desired.
- Eason is in a great situation actually I think. Yes, he would have liked to go on day two, but to be able to learn behind Rivers and really sit a year, while then coming in behind a great O-line and running game with some new weapons, will be much better than if he got somewhere that has him starting at some point as a rookie, when he is clearly now ready.
- And for the Raiders, I don't think you can necessarily look at Bowden as a pure receiver. He will be more of a gadget player, who they are likely to tag as a RB actually. I just don't like how they operated the board overall necessarily."
2685,2020-04-30 15:23:01,gaa0n8,Queen was a mock draft darling. Brooks and Murray had the better film.
2686,2020-04-29 16:33:09,gaa0n8,"They are different types of players, but Queen overall is a much better player at this point. So that just is an indication of the value of either pick. And for Brooks it simply wasn't there. Had they picked him in the second and felt like he fit their scheme, I'd have no problem with it. But to me he simply wasn't worth a first-round pick."
2687,2020-04-29 20:58:37,gaa0n8,Thank you so much!
2688,2020-04-29 22:37:07,gaa0n8,"Oh they definitely helped themselves and every team should happy about who they drafted, but that doesn't mean they could not have done a better job. In the Raiders' case that means trading down for guys like Arnette and Muse, who I just had a lot lower on my board."
2689,2020-04-30 00:41:41,gaa0n8,"They are among my ""other drafts I liked"" and you can listen to my thoughts on them in the video. I have Josh Jones and Eno Benjamin as steals and D-Hop was definitely worth a second-rounder, so I absolutely like what they did. I just came one slot short of being able to mention them basically."
2690,2020-04-30 23:31:36,gaa0n8,"I think they are actually very similar players. Strong edge-setters in the run game and power rushers primarily, but Robinson is already better with his hands. So getting him into the fifth compared to trading up for Taylor is crazy to me.

I don't mind their draft. I Claypool is kind of a boom-and-bust prospect, but I had him in that mid-day two range, I really like Dotson on day three and McFarland gives them something a little different as a home-run hitter. Highsmith was one of my sleepers and should fit them very well."
2691,2020-05-02 10:01:04,gaa0n8,"1) I can tell you very clearly why Dillon is that low for me (RB14). People have actually told me to put him higher and nothing about my evaluations is about group-thinking - Eno Benjamin had a third-round grade for me and he went in the seventh.
Dillon is massive and has sprinter-like speed for that size. If you read my RB rankings you will find some of my concerns. To me he is more of an athlete than running back. He can really hit the hole and explode through it if a lane is open, but there is no nuance to the way he presses the hole and sets up lanes, his footwork in tight spaces and the coordination of the lower body overall are very underwhelming. And in a league where RBs are a huge part of the passing game, he has not done anything to prove himself as a receiver.
In the right system, like he will be with LaFleur's zone-heavy scheme, he could absolutely be successful when he can round off those cuts and build up momentum, but as soon as color flashes in the backfield and he has to adjust on the fly, he will struggle.

2) I never said LaFleur wasn't a winner. Deguara will be a nice piece for him in that Juszczyk role and he has a very talented young QB to work with. I like Runyan, but there will probably only be one to make the final roster. Overall their class just wasn't very impressive. Through day two all of their picks were lower on my board and they didn't do a very good job working the board. LaFleur got his will, but they could have done better."
2692,2020-05-03 09:56:12,gaa0n8,Absolutely!
2693,2020-04-29 15:43:27,gaa0n8,"The lions did this in bob Quinn’s first season they used a fifth round pick and cut him before the season. Three things in life are certain death, taxes, and don fucking muhlbach."
2694,2020-04-29 20:52:34,gaa0n8,Why Ezra Cleveland?
2695,2020-04-29 15:29:10,gaa0n8,"I really like what we will be doing with Niang.

We will let him compete for a starting spot at Guard, but he is going to be the heir apparent for Fisher if he develops well.

Having that 1 year of learning technique and fundamentals from one of the most sound technique tackles in the game in Mitchell Schwartz is an exciting proposition."
2696,2020-04-29 19:31:13,gaa0n8,"How do you list AJ Terrell, who is admittedly a reach at 16th overall, but not include Damon Arnette to the Raiders? Arnette has a 3rd round grade in most big boards I looked at, while Terrell was a late 1st to mid 2nd grade."
2697,2020-04-29 22:51:46,gaa0n8,"I would agree on the Ravens. They are just at a different level when it comes to the draft.

The Jets did draft a lot of upside-type players, but when you look at their roster, they need true difference makers. Bringing in a bunch of solid players, who can get the job done but might be somewhat limit wouldn't make sense to me.
And when you look at the guys they picked through the first two days, here is what I think is the worst outcome: Becton - really powerful run-blocking guard, Mims - jump-ball specialist who immediately upgrades one of the worst red-zone offense, Davis - a super athlete at nickel, Zuniga - an explosive penetrator who will be part of the rotation at least.
And on day three all you really do is take your shots at the guys you like. I love Hall because of instincts and football IQ he presents and their punter could be one of the best in the league soon."
2698,2020-04-30 22:18:48,gaa0n8,Please read the write-up and check the part about how no more than four will make the roster.
2699,2020-05-03 09:52:04,gaa0n8,"1) Well, obviously. That is how you say it - you traded your two picks on day two for the New England's first-rounder. And I never said the value doesn't add up.
I had Murray as my 18th overall prospect. I just disagree with the general strategy, when you need those mid-round guys as the foundation of your roster, considering Bosa, Ingram, Henry, etc. will all be free agents next year.

2) They traded their left tackle for Turner - so that is kind of disingenuous if you phrase it like that. Bulaga was an excellent signing and the line should be a little better, but who will be your LT? - Sam Tevi, Trey Pipkins?"
2700,2020-04-30 08:43:06,gaa0n8,"Hamler did have plenty of drops, yes. But he has pretty good hands and tracks the deep ball exceptionally well. I definitely think that's something he can clean up and now he has a QB that actually gives him chances downfield.
Jerry isn't very physical and he did drop some balls where his eyes already went downfield, but separation is the name of the game and nobody created more of it with route-running than Jeudy.
And we don't know their board and if he was far from their BPA at that point, they wouldn't have taken him. I can just compare it to my rankings and look at the picks they ended up with, in addition to looking when the next CB was taken (30th overall). That makes it a questionable selection for me."
2701,2020-04-30 00:22:16,gaa0n8,"I dont agree with the ""value of position and what X had them ranked as"" take. 

It's easy to say X player is ranked Y. Lots of people outside of the NFL had them ranked as a 3rd rounder. 

We dont know. We arent putting millions on the line or having to deal with that pressure. We also dont know if other coaches like (sticking with the example) Arnette as much. There was a run of CB late in the first. I also notice how much the media lacks without Mayock there yet they all seem to question his decisions. Had he been there and said Arnette is a high corner just not as good as Okudah then he would have been a lot more hyped. He even came out and said he thought Arnette by himself at Ohio State would have been a top corner. We also dont know the personalities of these kids just tape. Juedy appears to be borderline idiotic but people still have him high. If he doesnt pan out itll be the teams fault like Jamarcus Russell for drafting a bust."
2702,2020-04-29 20:53:22,gaa0n8,"I'm a big fan of the raiders draft. Every pick fit what their team needs to a T.  They needed speed and playmakers on offense and secondary help. Every pick addressed that.  

They could have traded back 5-10 picks and probably still got Arnette, which is my main negative. Though, having that hamstring injury before the combine hurt his testing numbers and the cancelled pro day hurt his stock. 

Tanner Muse probably could have been had in the 4th as well. Which is my only other gripe with their picks."
2703,2020-04-29 15:31:40,gaa0n8,Oh for sure about Graham’s contract. I’m guessing 31 other teams got a laugh at that deal.
2704,2020-04-29 22:07:34,gaa0n8,Hell yeah I will! Thanks for taking the time to respond 🍻
2705,2020-04-29 18:56:06,gaa0n8,"There were reports the Ravens had Brooks above Queen at LB and that the Bengals would have taken Brooks at 33 if not for Seattle. So, I don't really feel like this is a fair complaint. As for Taylor, Schrager's final mock had him going in the first to seattle and Schneider actually did want him in the first but felt like taking Brooks now and trading up for Taylor would be more effective.

EDIT: Can't find the link for the Ravens source anymore, but here's one for the Bengals:  [https://www.cincyjungle.com/2020/4/28/21239220/seahawks-news-bengals-jordyn-brooks-nfl-rumors-tee-higgins-draft](https://www.cincyjungle.com/2020/4/28/21239220/seahawks-news-bengals-jordyn-brooks-nfl-rumors-tee-higgins-draft)"
2706,2020-04-29 23:19:04,gaa0n8,"The new Raiders seem to like kids from big programs who’ve played in big games. Clearly they give more weight to that than other teams do. I think they expected to draft the Clemson CB with the 19th pick, and just pivoted to Arnette when he wasn’t there. True, they could likely have picked up an extra third round pick by trading down. But if they saw a big drop off from Arnette to the fourth best CB, it’s probably why they made that move. On the field, Arnette was one of the best CBs in college football last year - 45% completion rate, no more than one TD per season. Same thing with Muse - they love Clemson players, got two last year and two this year."
2707,2020-04-30 21:08:50,gaa0n8,Raiders did trade down for Muse.  Picked up an extra pick that we used on Robertson.
2708,2020-05-02 12:37:56,gaa0n8,"1) You had Dillon as RB14 when only 16 RBs got Drafted, and one of your highest rated RBs went as RB15 and barely got drafted (7th Rounder). You may want to reconsider how you evaluate RBs, because there is more than one style as a RB. Furthermore, Dillon showed at the Combine that he can run routes and catch, he actually caught more passes than people give him credit for, he had one of the highest yards/route for any RB in the country, pro scouting services hired by the NFL said he can run routes pretty well.

2) I know you didn't say LaFleur wasn't a winner, but you chose to state the obvious framing it as Rodgers is a loser rather than LaFleur is a winner. By framing it as Rodgers is a loser, you aren't saying anything interesting and you are saying what everybody else is saying. If you had said LaFleur is a winner, now you have something unique on your hands that is much more interesting to read.

3) These h-backs are currently being underrated by Draftniks. Dalton Keene went in Round 3 as well. Deguara was considered a much better prospect than Keene by most. So if Keene went right after Deguara went and they are similar players then we can deduce that the Packers got good value because Deguara likely would've been taken by the Patriots."
2709,2020-04-29 16:30:26,gaa0n8,"Hahaha, I was surprised about the Swift pick, but overall it's a solid class for them."
2710,2020-04-29 21:03:11,gaa0n8,Lacks play strength and aggressiveness as a run-blocker. Had him as my OT9 and a third-round grade on him. Just a little early for me.
2711,2020-04-29 16:26:22,gaa0n8,Absolutely! Great pick!
2712,2020-04-29 20:52:16,gaa0n8,I think hes adding to a list that already includes Arnette
2713,2020-04-29 21:02:06,gaa0n8,Arnette is my second guy in the write-up. Terrell was just part of the additional names!
2714,2020-05-03 18:55:50,gaa0n8,"1) Then stop phrasing it as “in exchange for both day 2 picks” because you know that’s not an accurate representation of the trade.

2) Yea, they traded Okung for Turner: a) Okung is several years older than Turner, b) Turner is better at guard than Okung is at tackle, c) and perhaps most importantly, Okung has a long injury and health history, including last year when Okung was out for the majority of the season. So actually, it’s not disingenuous at all to say that the Chargers added Turner without directly mentioning Okung because it was as if Okung didn’t play last year, anyways. Also, even if you don’t want to agree with that point, they added Bulaga at tackle who is unquestionably better at tackle than Okung. Really, the only question mark the Chargers now have on the OL is LT - How many teams can say they only have one question mark on the OL? Regardless, the point is that it’s completely understandable that the Chargers didn’t spend draft capital on OL when they’ve already invested a ton into the OL this off-season."
2715,2020-04-30 14:50:13,gaa0n8,"He tracks the ball decently but he is much more of a nelson agholor,  Ted Ginn jr then anything. Speed guys with drop problems aren't easily corrected. Yes Judy wins with separation but you're failing to realize that he was beating up on a lot of the number 3 Corners because he was playing often out of the slot I don't think he's going to be a bus however I think he is going to be challenged a lot more and his production is it going to be the same. As far as your argument with Arnett you have no idea who the number 3 Corner was on many people's boards and on top of that if Mayock trade down who's to say that that guy is still there there is no guarantee in anything. Yes it would have been nice to trade down and potentially get the same player and pick up pics but as I said we don't know what the trade compensation would have been nor do we know if that player would still actually be available."
2716,2020-04-30 00:44:44,gaa0n8,"I get what you are saying and there is clearly truth in that. I never said that they completely wrong and what not. Just when I look at my board, the values just don't add up. There were better players available, but even if they want to get their guys, they could have accumulated draft capital in the process.
And the Raiders can kind of made this a run. Neither Terrell nor Arnette had any business in the top 20 in my opinion. Okudah and Henderson were locks. And then the next CB off the board was 30th overall only."
2717,2020-04-29 22:11:35,gaa0n8,"The Muse pick is the only one I really didn't agree with. Davion Taylor would have been preferable there for me. Can do the same things but has so much more potential, especially in coverage. I just don't see Muse contributing that much outside of special teams.  

Davis-Gaither was still on the board at that point too."
2718,2020-04-29 22:18:42,gaa0n8,"Listen to my video breakdown for more information! I said myself that I like the players. I just thought they could have worked the board better overall.

I'm actually not sure if Arnette would have been a first-rounder actually though and Muse is more of a sub-package LB and special teamer."
2719,2020-04-29 22:19:42,gaa0n8,No problem! Glad to help out! 👊🏼
2720,2020-04-29 21:00:57,gaa0n8,"I know he definitely was high on a lot of team's boards, but I just don't value him that highly. And a mock draft does not qualify anything to me. Haha"
2721,2020-04-30 00:05:55,gaa0n8,"Agreed. I had multiple CBs ahead of Arnette, but if he is your guy I don't hate getting him. But the next one at the position to be drafted come off at number 30. So I would strongly guess they could have picked up extra picks and still gotten their guy. Also with a team that had an early day three pick to grad Muse their and get another ticket to invest on somebody they like."
2722,2020-05-02 19:58:19,gaa0n8,"1) Maybe. But I don't have my track record. Had Alvin Kamara as a top 40 prospect when he was a third-round pick, Dalvin Cook as a top 10 prospect, Kareem Hunt as a mid-day pick and others. Nobody is perfect in their evaluations, but I think I have a pretty good eye for RBs being able to pace their runs, manipulate secondary defenders and put his blockers into good position, rather than looking at a massive guy just exploding through big holes and being able to run through arm-tackles, rather than making something out of nothing.
Gis hands do not look very natural (3 drops on 24 catchable passes) and at the combine it did not seem any different, in addition to major issues adjusting his footwork on the fly.
2) My write-up didn't have the title ""Most unique winners of the draft"", I even defined it as ""biggest winners and losers, steals and reaches"". You don't have to read it if you're not interested.
3) I understand the importance of a flex player like those guys for certain systems (because of that those guys might not be as high on a general board without specific team fits), but I can still say overall they were too high, when you already selected a non-receiving back and a developmental quarterback in the first round. Everybody got better, but I can say that in general they could have done better."
2723,2020-04-29 16:34:06,gaa0n8,Agreed I thought this was bob Quinn’s best draft
2724,2020-04-29 20:54:10,gaa0n8,I didn’t see his name mentioned anywhere?
2725,2020-05-04 18:36:11,gaa0n8,"1) I can phrase it exactly like that. If NFL Network or however shows the trade details, that's what it will read, and that's how it officially comes in as.
2) No question about that and I said they were better, but one complete liability on your O-line can wreck a gameplan. You can help with chips and sliding the protection that way to at least allow the LT to step out wide and take away an easier angle, but that doesn't take away the problem, especially with how much the Chargers had five out in the route last season.
And I would not say that they invested that much in the O-line. Turner's average is 2M below the one of Okung and 10M for a Pro Bowl level tackle is more than acceptable. They are still only 24th in the league in terms of % of cap spent on the OL and they could have at least taken a flyer on somebody like a Prince Tega Wanogho from Auburn late."
2726,2020-04-30 22:20:31,gaa0n8,"Man, it is MY opinion. I can tell you that plenty of teams dropped Arnette far down their board because of some character questions. And no, there is no guarantee, but you have to play the game and not just sit there and take your guys all the time."
2727,2020-04-30 05:58:16,gaa0n8,Trading back requires 2 parties and no guarantee the player you’d like will be there later. Raiders had no 2nd rounder and possibly didn’t get offers to trade back to a range they felt was comfortable. Trading back is always the trendy thing to do when you draft a player “early” based on media analyst evaluations. Sometimes it feels like we expect all teams to trade back if you take someone earlier than some mock drafts.
2728,2020-05-03 16:54:56,gaa0n8,You and the rest of the draft media definitely undervalue certain players like Terrell. Not only was it reported that he was way higher rated in NFL circles but Sean Payton even mentioned him as someone the Saints were targeting in a trade up. Also reports saying Raiders really liked Terrell. I'm pretty sure that natty skewed a lot of peoples perceptions of him which is crazy considering its one game. I've always heard you take a players best and worst game on film and throw them out and judge from the rest. I definitely would've preferred Okudah or Henderson but at the same time its clear Terrell is a better prospect than people are giving him credit for.
2729,2020-04-30 00:15:49,gaa0n8,I see muse as a gadget defensive player. In dime/nickel he could be a great safety to drop in the box. Fast enough to recover and react to alot of the spread formations we see today. Hopefully it works out. Mayock knows what hes doing.
2730,2020-04-29 21:45:19,gaa0n8,"I just included the mock and the info on other teams' boards because they indicate that around the scouting community of the NFL he was valued much more highly than among the media/casual scouting community. Also addresses you saying he was overdrafted when it seems from that information that he was drafted approximately in the range that other teams might have expected him to go. Also, there is a video from Samuel Gold where he explains why teams valued him more than the media, even those that watched Brooks' film: in 2018 he did a lot more in coverage but was asked to do different things in his 2019 film. I'd recommend you to watch it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk\_-WcDc8Kc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk_-WcDc8Kc)."
2731,2020-05-02 19:58:38,gaa0n8,*don't hate
2732,2020-05-02 20:32:13,gaa0n8,Drops are a very subjective stat and you're going to declare Dillon an unnatural pass-cstcher because he is proclaimed to have 3 drops? Wow.
2733,2020-04-29 16:42:07,gaa0n8,"Okudah is obviously a stud, but I actually think Jackson and Stenberg will start at the two guard spots. That alone is pretty good. Plus Swift forming a dynamic duo with Kerryon, Okwara being a high-upside edge rusher, who just needs to become a more consistent player and then one of my sleeper receivers in Cephus - the more I look at it, the more I like it actually.
Would have just liked to see them trade down from three with a QB-hungry team and still get their guy, but I don't think they got any real offers.
Could definitely see them compete for a Wildcard spot."
2734,2020-04-29 21:24:17,gaa0n8,Theres a big comment by OP titled biggest reaches and he's like first on the list.
2735,2020-05-19 19:01:48,gaa0n8,""" one complete liability on your O-line can wreck a gameplan ""

&#x200B;

totally...ask Jet fans about wayne hunter"
2736,2020-04-30 22:59:19,gaa0n8,"I can also tell you that many of the smart teams did their homework on his spat with the HC and it showed. Arnette matured quite a bit this season. Your opinions are terrible btw. Damon was also timed by many scouts and a 4.43 and he also was one of the best man corners who extremely physical. 
I didn't even mention the guy only allowed one TD. If you dont take your guys what do you end up with? You sound silly"
2737,2020-04-30 08:38:58,gaa0n8,Most definitely. But they had two picks in the top 20 and ended up with zero second-rounders and no picks past the fourth round. Do you think that's the right way to build your team?
2738,2020-05-04 18:24:58,gaa0n8,"No doubt. I always mentioned that the NFL is higher on Terrell than me and I don't kill him for the Natty, considering Trevon Diggs got lit up by Chase as well.
However, I think the ability to win at the catch point is something that can't be acquired like some other things like coverage-techniques and maybe some other things, and I'm just not as high on trait-based cover-guys, looking at the low success of guys like that with tape I didn't think of as highly. Guys like Fulton, Gladney and J. Johnson aren't as talented as Terrell, but they were more natural cover-corners to me."
2739,2020-04-30 01:17:28,gaa0n8,"I hope so. When I was watching his tape his tackling was hit and miss, and a lot of the time he looked lost when in space. I hate the ""pick the guy because he's from Clemson"" thing and that pick just felt a lot like that."
2740,2020-04-29 22:44:36,gaa0n8,"That can absolutely be the case in relation to where teams saw him. I can only speak from my point of view and I had them both as third-round prospects.
And yeah, I saw that - pretty good breakdown! But when Brooks was asked to play zone coverage last season, I thought he lacked awareness, and I don't think he deals well with blockers in his face. Maybe I was a little too low on him and I would love for him to prove me wrong. Too much the picks just didn't mix with my board. And you can certainly question some of the early picks they have made in recent years."
2741,2020-05-03 09:56:01,gaa0n8,"I did not say that. I just supported my argument by those numbers. You talked about him yards per reception as well, which can be very suspect, when he had loads of room to work with on the few screens he caught compared to more involved backs, who caught dump-offs and got hit in the back right away.
But you can watch him fight the ball, double-catch and just show clunky hands. Ande once again, his uncoordinated footwork also makes his ability to create separation as a route-runner a question mark."
2742,2020-04-29 16:44:23,gaa0n8,Yeah bob said they had talks with chargers dolphins and jags but nothing ever serious enough to make a trade. Can’t move down if no wants to move up. But I love the late round running back they drafted. He reminds me of Tarik Cohen
2743,2020-04-29 22:15:03,gaa0n8,"Ah, so it’s not in the main body? That’s why I missed it. Thanks for the heads up."
2744,2020-04-30 23:38:13,gaa0n8,"Thanks btw. You don't have to share or read them.
I like Arnette, but 19 is crazy to me and many people would agree with that. He might have been Ohio State's third-best CB last season and I don't even care about the times at the combine. I can see on tape that he lacks some top-end speed and he will get smoked by Tyreek, Mecole or whoever he matches up with against KC.
Obviously you should get ""your guys"", but at the right value."
2745,2020-04-30 15:07:01,gaa0n8,I don’t think it’s right or wrong. There are way too many variables and obviously plenty of ways to win in the NFL through the draft. 7 picks in 7 rounds is not that bad. They currently have about 95 players on their roster so I’m not sure having an extra 5th and 6th rounder would make that much of a difference. Undrafted FAs could be as important as the 6th and 7th round.
2746,2020-05-03 12:03:54,gaa0n8,"I mentioned yards per route, not yards per reception."
2747,2020-04-29 20:50:03,gaa0n8,"Yeah, Huntley is fun! Really undersized, but has some juice. Cohen is a little thicker and he's a little more creative in the open field, but he might actually be faster!"
2748,2020-04-30 22:21:25,gaa0n8,Yeah but one of the first-rounders and another one of their picks was from the Mack trade still. So they didn't have a lot of draft capital considering that.
2749,2020-05-04 18:20:10,gaa0n8,"Yeah, but that statistic just doesn't say much without context. When the RB is rarely out in the route and the few times he is, it is on screen passes in long-yardage situations with a lot of room to work (not saying that's all he did), that number will look pretty inflated."
2750,2020-04-29 20:50:49,gaa0n8,Yeah I believe Huntley is faster but not certain
2751,2020-05-01 00:46:19,gaa0n8,They gained cap space in addition to 2 first rounders. Mack is tremendous. But paying him and not winning was gonna hamstring their FA additions. It’s debatable what was the right call since the rookies haven’t played out their tenures nor Mack. They were draft capital positive from the Mack trade. I think they’d rather have bears first than another 2nd where they picked
2752,2020-04-29 21:02:29,gaa0n8,And better. Because Patterson was a catastrophe at Michigan. Haha
2753,2020-05-01 09:28:04,gaa0n8,"That's a completely different topic.
I'm just saying that their draft haul without that would be pretty underwhelming. And with that extra first rounder, they could have managed their ressources better."
2754,2020-05-01 17:24:17,gaa0n8,"Again, barring the ability to trade down with any offers. It’s easy to say he was drafted earlier than projections. It’s tough for me to agree with just trade down and get him later or trade up from 3rd to 2nd and get him there. Lots of contingencies"
2755,2020-05-02 10:03:23,gaa0n8,"There's no way either one of us will know the offers they did receive. We also don't know how all these picks will turn out and what the players are going to develop into.
But according to that logic none of the evaluations or judgements make any sense. Then we might as well just not talk about it. Haha"
2756,2020-05-02 10:04:13,gaa0n8,We can only judge what DID happen.
2757,2020-04-28 23:14:05,g9xynk,His movies are pretty bad. Lol

2760,2020-04-28 23:56:41,g9xynk,"i actually like his movies, they're pretty repetitive and don't have top notch acting but they're still funny and entertaining to me"

2770,2020-04-28 23:44:24,g9xynk,That’s because he didn’t direct it.
2771,2020-04-28 23:51:30,g9xynk,"It’s not a black and white issue. But he kind of makes it that when he only usually hire those in his community. Nothing really wrong with that, but it’s the exact thing people have been complaining about white people doing forever, if that makes sense."
2772,2020-04-29 00:57:26,g9xynk,"Isn’t that so lame? I used to struggle thinking I’d have to come up with the most incredible story to make it. Meanwhile, Jersey Shore is a HIT!"
2773,2020-04-29 00:22:38,g9xynk,Just to play devil's advocate here...How do you know if you haven't seen them?  You say you remember turning on the tv and catching part of one a while ago.  But have you ever watched his movies?  (But yes they are terrible)
2774,2020-04-28 23:46:24,g9xynk,I’m pretty sure his audience is just black people because he pretty much only hired black people for his movies and being up the community. Nothing wrong with that. Just also find it ironic how people complain about all white movies then movies like his come out. Lol
2775,2020-04-28 23:28:56,g9xynk,"I know, I was just saying it was a surprise to see how well he could act.

He just can’t write or direct."
2776,2020-04-28 23:45:07,g9xynk,I know I was just saying I was surprised at how good of an actor he was when he actually had direction.
2777,2020-04-29 00:24:52,g9xynk,I think I’ve seen one or part of one. I’ve seen some of his shows on TBS. They aren’t good. None of the trailers help either.
2778,2020-04-28 23:49:51,g9xynk,"I think the sheer numbers alone are what people complain about: only few all black movies vs vast majority mainly white movies.

2833,2020-04-26 00:04:59,g838yy,"This was such a good fucking draft for us I just love it! I see a lot of people sleeping on our draft. We got the best CB, probably the best RB, while also solidifying our o-line AND d-line. Our 1st 4 picks are pretty well guaranteed starters, And the rest are looking at rotational (the 2 DT's we took late) and/or special teams (The 2nd RB we took) roles or smaller roles this year that will bloom into larger ones next year (Cephus who is entering a crowded WR room that has a lot of contracts up this year). 

Obviously the way drafts work it is normal for not every pick to make the team but I can't help but see there being 4 starters minimum (maybe 5 depending on how they handle our guard situation), a rotational RB and kick returner, and at least a couple rotational players there.

This draft topping off our FA has left this team pretty much completely transformed and I am super excited to see how they look when the season comes around. Our offense just looks fucking TERRIFYING now (was already good with Staff-daddy last year and we made steps to beef up the o-line and got a top-line RB to go with the new line) and our defense is completely transformed after last years shit-tastic season (LB has been MASSIVELY overhauled, CB should be improved, d-line will be healthier and younger)."

2921,2020-04-27 20:48:02,g838yy,"The theme of this draft is that the rich get richer. The Niners, Ravens, Chiefs, and Saints all IMPROVED and brightened their futures greatly. If the 49ers proved anything, they proved that a phenomenal defensive line leads to a phenomenal defense. They had a full pass rush of 1st rounders, the Redskins have a starting pass rush of Chase Young, Matt Ioannidis, Montez Sweat, Daron Payne, and Jonathan Allen (All 1st rounders aside from Ioannidis.) If Haskins takes a leap this year, and the young recievers play well this year. They could be a 5-6 seed. BUT, if those prerequisites happen PLUS they can manage to get a legitimate #1 corner and upgrade on the O line, they COULD be a legit Super Bowl contender next year (more likely in 2021,) PLUS they have a veteran coach in Ron Rivera. All of this is coming from a Giants fan btw."
2922,2020-04-29 11:16:45,g838yy,"Everyone is hating on the Packers draft but tbh I’m excited to see Rodgers operate in a run first offense. Take some pressure off 12 and get some stacked boxes to take pressure off the whole passing game 

People forget that Rodgers threw for 4K yards last season and his WR2 was a jaguars practice squad player. 

People are overreacting like they did when the Packers hired MLF, who r/nfl said would be a disaster and could never work well with Rodgers (obviously turned out to be false after 13-3 record and great relationship so far) 

GB swept the NFCN last season, 6-0. Also finished as the 3rd best team in the league with 13 wins, and more quality wins against good teams than any other team last season, statistically. Let’s wait a season or two before calling everyone a bust and declaring GBs championship window closed."
2923,2020-04-25 23:10:03,g838yy,Our picks arent bad but we really didn't go for a single Guard? Really fucking hope we don't try moving tackles to guards as it hasnt worked out at all before
2924,2020-04-27 22:31:46,g838yy,I think the ravens had the best draft but Miami had a very efficient draft picking up what they needed. Plus that first round wasn’t fucked up which is an accomplishment

3014,2020-04-25 23:14:58,g838yy,"It’s just so weird. I understand the theory behind the pick, if you think the guy is the future of the franchise, you take him. But by the time Rodgers is retired, Love is  at the end of his rookie contract and you have no idea if it’s worth going forward with him. It completely defeats the purpose of having a potential franchise qb on the rookie deal."
3015,2020-04-25 23:08:10,g838yy,Have you found any Packers fans who like the Jordan Love pick?
3016,2020-04-26 03:15:14,g838yy,"Second rounder I can kinda get, change of pace big bruiser rb in a run heavy offense while both our initial rbs are on contract years this year. The 1st and 3rd were totally blown."
3017,2020-04-26 12:10:21,g838yy,AJ Dillon is a monster. Could see him being the best running back in this class at some point. Thought for sure the Steelers would get him though. Didn’t think the Packers would be the team to draft him.
3018,2020-04-26 17:29:02,g838yy,I’m pretty sure Gute is trying to make the Packers into the Tennessee Titans 2.0.

3035,2020-04-26 20:42:01,g838yy,Interesting that offense and defense is even and the positions on defense are split pretty evenly too. Wonder if it’s like that every year.

3043,2020-04-25 23:17:20,g838yy,I cry seeing how many of these guys the Packers had a chance to draft but didn’t.
3044,2020-04-25 23:16:29,g838yy,Get outta here with your logic. Best drafts were Packers and Eagles.
3045,2020-04-25 23:14:10,g838yy,The Redskins had a great draft as well

3048,2020-04-26 02:38:49,g838yy,4th should be Harrison Bryant. Most analyst thought he was the best tight end in the draft. Crazy that he dropped so far.
3049,2020-04-25 23:26:12,g838yy,"What do you think about the 49ers having a “sneaky” draft? I thought they did a good job overall, but not as well on paper as the top teams you listed. They made some good trades on day 3 and not a lot of people mention them so “sneaky” seems like a good way to classify their draft."
3050,2020-04-25 23:04:58,g838yy,Good analysis

3082,2020-04-26 00:05:11,g838yy,"I think besides the questionable Hurts pick, y'all had a pretty good draft. Not super flashy but you got some good players."
3083,2020-04-26 08:50:14,g838yy,"You guys had a good draft. The Hurts pick isn't bad at all. QB is far and away the most valuable position on the field, so taking a shot at a project/athlete isn't really all that bad."
3084,2020-04-26 05:26:44,g838yy,"I think the first round hesitation to move up for a difference maker at WR is the bigger issue than Hurts. I think it's too early to judge that pick. I think he can produce enough gadget offense if used right while also still playing the role of a backup quarterback. Philly fans may regret hating on the pick so bad. But also I could be wrong, who knows? It's just early imo."
3085,2020-04-26 01:37:51,g838yy,Ya I was pretty excited for me after you guys got Hurts. But you did draft a WR (with some drop issues which is ironically hilarious) but seeing CeeDee with a star on his helmet is going to Hurts for a long time and I'm going to love it.
3086,2020-04-26 18:37:13,g838yy,"Hurts is a project QB who may or may not replace Wentz once his contract runs out. Until then he is going to be a backup. The only bad aspect of the pick is how early it came. I guess they liked him much more than the other project QBs still left at the time. I disagree and would have taken a CB, but your front office has shown to be very good at building the roster in the past.

The hate the Reagor pick got was even more off the mark. You guys desperately needed a vertical threat and Disk Sheep just isn’t that. Yes, CeeDee is a better WR overall. But it’s not like Reagor wasn’t seen as a potential 6th first round WR for months. In fact you have been linked with Reagor a lot these last months, so I really fail to see how it’s such a surprise pick."
3087,2020-04-26 04:25:29,g838yy,Your QB is a fragile China doll.  You don't want a decent backup?
3088,2020-04-25 23:04:45,g838yy,He definitely should have. Any undrafted player should have maximized their eligibility (murder investigation drops aside).
3089,2020-04-25 23:03:28,g838yy,"Don’t really think it qualifies as a “feeling” at this point.

If you entered the draft and go undrafted, you shouldn’t have entered the draft to begin with."

3105,2020-04-26 07:25:09,g838yy,Tbh I really wish we would've grabbed KJ Hill with our first 7th rounder instead of another project LB.
3106,2020-04-26 08:12:29,g838yy,"I was not surprised by the Love pick. Its basically a Favre/Fogers situation. Have a good, older QB at the end of his prime, dont want to keep said QB around as he declines noticably (i.e. Eli Manning), so you find a promising prospect to spend a few years under Rogers before being (hopefully) ready to take over. And I think Love is a great prospect for that. The Packers have done that before, and I suspect that is there plan.

And yes, its pretty clear LaFleur is looking to move away from the typical Packer's gunslinging offence. And it seems like the rest of the organization agrees as I doubt they do this draft if they werent in agreement. A coach can come in and change the scheme and style within reason, and it happens fairly often, teams go from a 4-3 defence to a 3-4. Or they go from a checkdown qb to a mobile, qb run focused offence (see Ravens/Lamar). Now, they should probably do it in a more professional manner though.

So you are perfectly right to be pissed this wasnt properly discussed with fans previously, but this idea that LaFleur and Gute were brought in to 'fix' the same scheme/system put in place before them without tweaking it to their own strengths. Coaches are not all the same. McCarthy and LaFleur arent going to have the same strengths and weaknesses and cant call the same game. Shanahan is going to run and build a team differently then Reid. I think if you asked Gute/LaFleur their opinion, they wouldnt talk about Shanahan, rather they would tell you they were building the team they believe they can execute most successfully."
3107,2020-04-26 09:36:38,g838yy,Thata a great post
3108,2020-04-27 15:16:13,g838yy,"I'll say it here because it's so unpopular with other Packer fans, but I'm torn about the Love pick because of this: I think Rodgers lost the fire that won him the 2010 Super Bowl a long time ago. 

On the one hand, I can see a few key additions this year giving the Packers a chance in 2 years to win when Rodgers is 38. I think it's a stretch to say it's likely this year. But a few young guys breaking out in year 2 could make it possible. 

On the other hand, the other QBs from the mid-to-early 2000s have mostly left their teams with no succession plan: Rivers, Roethlisberger, and Brady all have spun their teams into tough spots through the murkiness of their fading years. The Packers just didn't want to be caught in that spot. That makes a lot of sense. 

While I think Rodgers has another championship in him skill-wise, I don't actually see it from his behavior. He rarely revs his team up on the sidelines and because he never got married he is still on his Ted-Mosby existential quest in his outside life. I think it can be a temptation for Packers fans to think 2010 - or even 2014 - is ever coming back to us, and maybe Gute and Lafleur are just the first to see the writing on the wall."
3109,2020-04-25 23:18:37,g838yy,"I love the top of our Draft minus the RB, but Tomlin and Canada probably know the guy pretty well. 

Claypool is a special teams beast, and I think wasn’t used well at ND (I’m a chip long hater), Also fills our lack of a “big” WR. 

Highsmith is great depth for our Edge. 

And Dotson is not only a huge steeler fan, but he was an all American. Love the IOL help. 

I’ll reserve judgement on the later picks because I just don’t know the players well enough tbh."

Let's hope the application is equal or exceeds the talent level!"
3113,2020-04-26 00:21:30,g838yy,"I just don’t understand why they’d want him out? The new guy isn’t going to play as well as he does. If money is the issue, why did they give it to him? It was only two years ago. He appears to get along well with LaFleur and the entire team. It makes no sense."

3118,2020-04-26 10:57:54,g838yy,Some guys do slip through the cracks though.  Look at the pats pick the safety from Lenore Ryhne Kyle Douger. They traded down and still got their guy. And this looks like the pick with most potential Bill has had in years. The only reason why he went so high is because he played D2 football.

3179,2020-04-27 02:01:36,g838yy,"Cole Kmet was the consensus TE1 by the time the draft rolled around, but Hunter Bryant was generally pegged as a mid-round guy. I'm really surprised that he went undrafted."
3180,2020-04-26 00:03:41,g838yy,You're probably thinking of Harrison Bryant
3181,2020-04-25 23:16:14,g838yy,"Good kicker, but was 'only' 81% last year and multiple kickers are never a lock to be drafted. He'll compete in camp pretty easily."
3182,2020-04-25 23:26:26,g838yy,"He went 80% in college. He's not spectacular by any means. He just seemed amazing because of his goggles giving him a ton of press and because college kickers are so shit in general.

He was always going to get a chance to compete in someone's camp no matter what. No reason to draft a kicker."
3183,2020-04-25 23:16:41,g838yy,Absolutely wild. The guy was incredible in college. I must be a moron.
3184,2020-04-25 23:29:20,g838yy,Reminds me of those pickup baseball days where nobody picked me and I was the only one with glasses
3185,2020-04-28 12:59:30,g838yy,"No, he's overrated because he wore some goggles and made some kicks in big games that most of the nation watched. In reality he only kicked like 81%."
3186,2020-04-26 01:50:28,g838yy,Gordon only had one year and wasn't as good as minchew
3187,2020-04-25 23:06:49,g838yy,"Cause he has a name, most people don't scout enough to see who else could be drafted."
3188,2020-04-25 23:08:20,g838yy,Man didn't drop one pass at LSU.
3189,2020-04-25 23:08:45,g838yy,Could this be a case of him telling teams he would rather not be drafted than taken in the 6th or 7th round? I know that happens in the NBA but don't know how common it is in the NFL

3191,2020-04-26 01:37:19,g838yy,Not even the best undrafted tight end
3192,2020-04-25 23:51:32,g838yy,Must have been the jones fracture.
3193,2020-04-25 23:48:18,g838yy,All the GMs were on their couch too
3194,2020-04-26 01:44:09,g838yy,Didn't watch LSU besides the championship game. But I found it interesting that the Seahawks took the other LSU TE that had like very little receptions and 1 TD.
3195,2020-04-25 23:46:19,g838yy,He’s signing with the Redskins.
3196,2020-04-25 23:17:57,g838yy,Worth a 6th round just to make Goodell pronounce that
3197,2020-04-26 04:05:33,g838yy,Maybe he did but the guy had a stroke typing out the name
3198,2020-04-26 01:06:27,g838yy,Is that name real?
3199,2020-04-26 01:02:33,g838yy,smh forgetting X-Wing @ Aliciousness like that

3204,2020-04-25 23:24:04,g838yy,Dillon wasn’t drafted
3205,2020-04-26 01:55:57,g838yy,14 drafted then 4 signed a UDFA
3206,2020-04-25 23:16:16,g838yy,Thank you
3207,2020-04-25 23:14:00,g838yy,Obviously he wasn’t being drafted his dad is still living
3208,2020-04-25 23:10:01,g838yy,Must not have played basketball growing up
3209,2020-04-25 23:10:17,g838yy,:(
3210,2020-04-26 00:05:56,g838yy,"Wait, Randy Moss has a son?"
3211,2020-04-26 02:38:03,g838yy,Bears are probably interested in picking up TE depth
3212,2020-04-25 23:30:25,g838yy,fuck man not only did they draft great they got Nuk also
3213,2020-04-27 05:31:51,g838yy,We need kyler to pull a baker mayfield otherwise our division is going to be a warzone
3214,2020-04-25 23:56:01,g838yy,I mean we drafted 4 lineman. His body won but his stats definitely lost
3215,2020-04-25 23:38:23,g838yy,"The lack of a drafted receiver is odd, but I don't think Rodgers is in any way in danger until the end of his contract. No quarterback plays forever."
3216,2020-04-26 01:10:08,g838yy,Bears won.
3217,2020-04-26 02:35:39,g838yy,An absurdly accurate QB throwing it to the receiver with the best catch radius in the draft? I'd say that's a pretty good combo
3218,2020-04-26 15:29:22,g838yy,And we got Jeff
3219,2020-04-26 07:13:52,g838yy,"Because of Jalen Hurts? All of our other picks were good. Raegor might be a bit of a reach but I’ve definitely come around on him. Everyone (including myself) is shocked by the Hurts pick, but that doesn’t make the rest of our draft bad"
3220,2020-04-26 15:29:56,g838yy,Our draft was a solid A imo. Stoked at just about every pick
3221,2020-04-26 09:07:37,g838yy,The more I look at it the worse it gets.
3222,2020-04-26 07:49:58,g838yy,"https://mobile.twitter.com/SDS/status/1122621369349562369/photo/1

Honestly not too awful. Obviously missed on Burrow, and 10 is a big ol miss. The rest are all 1st rounders minus Delpit."
3223,2020-04-26 23:48:09,g838yy,Maybe a lich
3224,2020-04-25 23:57:52,g838yy,Aarons* lost the draft
3225,2020-04-26 03:48:56,g838yy,"If you do the math, you won't choose Aaron's (draft)"
3226,2020-04-26 00:49:04,g838yy,Literally has a whole new Oline
3227,2020-04-26 00:23:27,g838yy,"Jets had a good draft for sure, but Becton has too much to prove in pass protection to call Darnold the winner over Lock."
3228,2020-04-26 06:25:47,g838yy,"Definitely AFCW defenses lost the draft. Ruggs, Jeudy, Edwards-Helaire, Herbert (we’ll see), and a host of offensive skill position and linemen across the board. It feels like an arms race."
3229,2020-04-25 23:07:26,g838yy,Lock did lol
3230,2020-04-25 23:06:39,g838yy,"For me, it's personal. His music is played entirely too much in this house, always with my wife saying he's her boyfriend."
3231,2020-04-26 09:28:59,g838yy,"I've never heard of him before, so unbiased opinion here, but that song was awful. He got a big book of country cliches picked some at random and put it over some safe and boring chords. I like country but that was awful. I had never heard of H.E.R. before and enjoyed her performance. So the idea of having music isn't awful, just that specific song happened to suck."
3232,2020-04-25 23:31:49,g838yy,"Because if you’re going to play country music, a genre already heavily hated, don’t bring on Luke Bryan, one of the most hated country artists."
3233,2020-04-25 23:58:15,g838yy,"Because his music is for middle aged wine loving housewife’s and dipshit college freshman that haven’t realized they don’t have to listen to what their parents listen to. I can understand the argument for music like that at a super bowl halftime, even though I still disagree, but doing it during the draft was aggressively stupid."
3234,2020-04-26 01:55:55,g838yy,"People don't like ""bro-country"" and want country music to stay the same as it did in the 90s and 80s. Like Bryan is one of the biggest ""new"" country music artists and so people hate on him. As a younger person who enjoys faster music old style country music is too slow for me. 

TLDR: people don't like new style of music and Luke Bryan represents a new style of music."
3235,2020-04-25 23:48:34,g838yy,Thanks fam - I’m very happy we took him.
3236,2020-04-26 05:20:39,g838yy,Same. Really happy we used all 3 of those picks in the first round.
3237,2020-04-26 00:38:12,g838yy,Exactly how I feel about ours
3238,2020-04-26 02:28:16,g838yy,"I don’t believe the Packers intend to keep Rodgers that long. He’s trade bait next year unless he has an MVP season. 

That may sound crazy, but it’s the only thing close to rational after picking his replacement."
3239,2020-04-26 02:10:27,g838yy,Unless you plan to groom him and trade Rodgers in a couple of years for more picks.
3240,2020-04-26 22:18:35,g838yy,"2 years is behind Aaron then a trade is my bet. Which leaves 2 years on his rookie deal plus the fifth year option, only a year less than a non first round pick. Trading Aaron then frees up 20 mil in space. That will be huge to build around Love. Rodgers has 17m in dead money but will get some draft value back. 

Flacco went for a 4th so it'll be more than that. Joe also had 16mil in dead money to only free up 10mil in space so it's actually a pretty solid comparison."
3241,2020-04-25 23:15:43,g838yy,"There is a few people going ""but it's just like Favre"". Other than that, most just hate it less than our other picks"
3242,2020-04-25 23:14:11,g838yy,"I can get going for a QB as Rodgers has had a few injuries and is definitely not his godlike self anymore, still just...weird how it all happened though."
3243,2020-04-26 00:46:38,g838yy,A couple of my Packers friends have accepted the Love pick. It’s the rest of the draft they’re really mad about.
3244,2020-04-25 23:39:40,g838yy,Me
3245,2020-04-26 02:14:16,g838yy,There’s actually a large chunk of fans that like it. I think that number is growing too.
3246,2020-04-25 23:39:53,g838yy,"I have some friends who like it because they wanted Rodgers to have competition. Personally I don't think Love generates any competition, but I don't hate the idea of having a better backup."
3247,2020-04-25 23:38:22,g838yy,Unfortunately accurate
3248,2020-04-25 23:13:14,g838yy,I think Goodell gained a lot of fans thanks to this virtual draft lol
3249,2020-04-25 23:40:14,g838yy,The edibles finally hit
3250,2020-04-26 00:09:26,g838yy,By the end of the 3rd round he looked my dad after Thanksgiving dinner he was ready to pass out
3251,2020-04-26 10:16:47,g838yy,Bring yourself back online
3252,2020-04-26 02:46:30,g838yy,It's funny you think you've avoided it just by not getting new Lamar Jackson on the Ravens.
3253,2020-04-26 05:33:39,g838yy,"How dare you imply that this sub would be a joke into the ground. 

BTW did you know Kelvin Benjamin is fat?"
3254,2020-04-26 01:10:32,g838yy,Jackson (B)
3255,2020-04-26 05:33:17,g838yy,"One year the Bengals had like 6 players on offense named ""Johnson"""
3256,2020-04-26 04:06:47,g838yy,"Well, one of them would just say MVP. There, no confusion."
3257,2020-04-26 10:19:52,g838yy,Oof
3258,2020-04-26 01:12:44,g838yy,It's ok. We a run team now.
3259,2020-04-25 23:40:52,g838yy,"Rodgers is with us for a few more years, I don't think the draft is going to change that. If I'm wrong that will suck, but we'll see."
3260,2020-04-25 23:40:03,g838yy,Clearly not a Gruden grinder
3261,2020-04-25 23:35:37,g838yy,What about GRIT pip?

3264,2020-04-25 23:49:01,g838yy,Yes!  Thank you!  Now if you could just explain it to me I'll pass it on to all the pissed off fans.
3265,2020-04-26 07:18:03,g838yy,Our draft aside from the Hurts pick was unironically good. Everyone gets blinded by that pick and just ignores the rest
3266,2020-04-25 23:26:53,g838yy,They did a good job and I think the bengals killed it as well.
3267,2020-04-26 06:59:38,g838yy,Wish the Cardinals would've picked him up instead of double dipping on low ceiling run stuffing DTs
3268,2020-04-26 10:12:25,g838yy,The real tragedy here
3269,2020-04-26 04:13:04,g838yy,Packer fans have been looking for answers at the bottom of bottles all weekend and still can't find one.
3270,2020-04-26 00:53:00,g838yy,"We’re probably gonna let Jones go unless he takes a below market contract and Dillon looks better and better the more I learn about him. 

The QB? Yeah, idk."
3271,2020-04-26 00:02:36,g838yy,"I’m not saying it’s a good idea, but just the *chance* of having a pissed of Rodgers throwing to Tae and AB is doing things for me."
3272,2020-04-26 05:53:29,g838yy,"I think many GMs are starting to realize that the game on offense is becoming about hybrid styles that have a lot more running to them.  The Lions starting changing to this style the last year or two.

Look the last 10 winners of the SB, (KC is an anomaly because their QB is insanely good on a rookie contract)  they almost all system teams or defensive minded teams."
3273,2020-04-26 04:17:30,g838yy,thats such BS or at least mostly BS.  I think they want hybrid offense.  The fact that last time I checked the GM hadn't even all talked to Rogers is a message
3274,2020-04-25 23:45:04,g838yy,They love the offensive linemen and running backs.
3275,2020-04-26 02:48:57,g838yy,I hope you're right because Raiders signed Eberle and I'd really like Carlson to not be on our team.
3276,2020-04-26 16:46:12,g838yy,"We did get 4 starters out of our 2018 draft (Ragnow, Kerryon, Walker, and Hand), just need them to stay healthy! But yeah, I'm definitely excited about this draft class."
3277,2020-04-26 00:08:50,g838yy,It's the Philadelphia Track Meet out here now. Every skill position player ran like a 4.4 or better.
3278,2020-04-26 04:27:05,g838yy,We'll give you an overrated running back and a 2nd round pick for him.  (Assuming you'll jump on that deal since you're from Texas.)
3279,2020-04-26 08:31:45,g838yy,"We got this low-key guy who we sadly dont have room on the roster for now. Real veteran pressence, always speaks highly of his QB, real playmaker with no injury issues. Would maybe take CeeDee plus a first for him, real value for the Philly legend that is named Alshon."
3280,2020-04-27 06:30:13,g838yy,Your QB is a goddamn dwarf.  As soon as he loses a step his effectiveness will plummet.
3281,2020-04-25 23:21:07,g838yy,How does that work? Can they go back to college and play or is that officially it for their college career?
3282,2020-04-26 18:28:06,g838yy,"It’s not that simple. Players who fall to the late rounds often hope they go undrafted, because it allows them to choose their team. And players who might not get drafted really benefit from the attention declaring for the draft and going to the scouting combine can get them."
3283,2020-04-25 23:22:45,g838yy,Totally. Completely see that side of things. But i just can’t imagine this working well for them
3284,2020-04-26 01:56:31,g838yy,They did hit on some picks that draft but it hasn't led to their long term prosperity so I  don't know that that is a great comparison.
3285,2020-04-25 23:52:54,g838yy,Luxury Yacht Jerry is clearly best Jerry
3286,2020-04-26 20:44:31,g838yy,"Wonder how much input McCarthy had. I know the cowboys usually draft pretty well, but MM has to be an upgrade over Garrett."
3287,2020-04-26 01:13:25,g838yy,Disco sheep indeed
3288,2020-04-26 07:31:08,g838yy,I was hoping the same but honestly at that point its all a crapshoot and itll be eadier to fill wr depth than lb IMO
3289,2020-04-25 23:33:26,g838yy,"The running back selection for us is fine for me, because we got Dotson later. Like you swap those picks I'm happy so the results are fine"
3290,2020-04-26 03:42:09,g838yy,You didn’t like the McFarland pick? That was the best late round running back pick of the draft. Would take him in a heartbeat over Perine who was picked right ahead of him
3291,2020-04-26 03:19:02,g838yy,Any team with their head screwed on straight would want to keep him around. Wtf are the Packers thinking with that draft though? You’ve hopefully got two more elite years of Rodgers and throw in the towel on competing?
3292,2020-04-26 15:25:19,g838yy,What the fuck are you on about
3293,2020-04-27 12:03:10,g838yy,"Lions did well. I can see them having a better season. I don’t see them winning but I see them as a wildcard contender. I just can’t have that kind of hope in them to see much else, they gotta prove it to me and everyone else the same way the Vikings need go prove they are Super Bowl contenders and not just a early playoff team

Edit: being said, I have a hard time putting them over the packers. Maybe they are that third wildcard we get this year for the nfc?"
3294,2020-04-27 17:55:56,g838yy,"Honestly. The way they put together story after story, intentionally, ahead of time, with serious planning and time to self evaluate the content that would be broadcast to millions, is a firable offense. Who in their right mind would think this is the best way to produce quality content for a telecast. All they had to do was show more highlights and scouting reports, or stories actually related to their football careers. I wish I knew who specifically made the call to air all that garbage so I can never watch anything they produce again. This is the price we pay for letting Disney control sports coverage and own ESPN."
3295,2020-04-26 18:54:20,g838yy,"Thanks, the Giants first two picks mirrored essentially what the Browns did. Petty interesting stuff"
3296,2020-04-26 04:42:43,g838yy,"I'm hoping Zuniga will be a good contributor on the edge. I'm pretty excited about Ashtyn Davis play FS as well. Having Jamal Adams playing ss near the los along with a solid edge rusher, I'm expecting good things. Will be nice to have CJ Mosely back as well. I don't think Joe Douglas could've done any better. Maybe getting a right tackle, but hey, you can't get everything.

You guys are looking good as well. East is gonna be wide open this year. Bills are strong."

He's got a great arm, touch, and anticipation on throws. Just struggled reading coverages and decision making which could improve learning under Rodgers.

The Packers were way too good and had way too few draft value to make a good rebuild work. Also planning for a future after Rodgers, it might not work because even 3 years is too long in the future to know how to draft for it now."
3350,2020-04-26 07:15:06,g838yy,"Y’all are probably closer to the middle then the bottom, but yeah Hurts was the weird pick and Reagor imo was a reach and Taylor is pretty raw. Y’all had a good day 3 though."
3351,2020-04-27 05:21:32,g838yy,"I think the Hurts pick will skew the way people judge our draft. Overall I think it went fantastic, round two was just so shocking that it pulled all the attention."

3359,2020-04-26 05:19:25,g838yy,I was ecstatic when you guys drafted Andrew Thomas because he's a really good football player at a position of need. Smart pick. Also it meant we got Tua.
3360,2020-04-26 02:17:23,g838yy,"But even that doesn't make sense.  There are two realistic scenario's (assuming Rodgers doesn't pull a Gronk or something and threaten to retire if they trade him or something)

Scenario 1) He's still good and you're trading away a really good quarterback who makes you a contender.  Trading him here only makes sense if you think Love is Mahomes' like otherwise it makes you worse in the short term, which would be bad considering you're a title contender

Scenario 2) If he's bad, you've got an old as hell bad quarterback making a ton of money.  What kind of return is that gonna get you?"
3361,2020-04-25 23:56:57,g838yy,Can confirm. The Love pick looks almost reasonable compared to the second and third rounds.
3362,2020-04-27 20:04:25,g838yy,It's really nothing like Favre. Rogers wasn't a reach. He was battling with Alex Smith for #1 overall and fell into their lap. They could've waited for a bit and probably still gotten Love.
3363,2020-04-25 23:18:39,g838yy,And then to not add any receivers to help both QBs out
3364,2020-04-25 23:19:52,g838yy,This right here. We are one Rodgers injury away from a fruitless season. The rest of our picks... Wtf are we doing? They couldn't give us one single WR? Seems like a slap in the face
3365,2020-04-26 14:46:00,g838yy,"They traded up infront of Ravens and Seahawks right? That seems weird to trade up infront of. Additionally, ""not his godlike self"" cannot be said 4 months outside of his latest nfc championship appearance.

Trust me, I love thinking Rodger's is on his way out but I don't understand where you can said he's not godlike after sweeping our division."

3370,2020-04-27 22:33:52,g838yy,I’d say the ravens probably had the best draft considering the nabbed first or second round talent through the first five rounds
3371,2020-04-26 00:39:40,g838yy,I'm actually very happy about our draft tbh
3372,2020-04-26 04:46:48,g838yy,"I also don't really like the Chargers draft, mainly because I disagree with their first round. I don't think Herbert will be good, especially behind that line, and trading picks to move up for Kenneth Murray is a questionable more. I love Murray the guy but I don't think he was worth trading back up for"
3373,2020-04-26 05:17:51,g838yy,"It seems pretty reasonable given that the last highly touted WR prospect was drafted right before they went on the clock.

3396,2020-04-26 02:06:58,g838yy,He becomes coach of the Packers and gives Love exactly what he wants...uses every single pick on QBs.
3397,2020-04-26 20:35:18,g838yy,"They might have wasted some value and certainly missed out on adding a “win now” weapon by going QB in the 1st, but I think it’s too early to hate the move. Often times teams wait until it’s too late to replace their star QB and end up scrambling later with a QB carousel. If he doesn’t pan out at least they get to try again before Rodgers is done. 

If they told him before drafting him that the plan was he’s sitting for 2 years and the kid is okay with that, they might have set themselves up nicely for post-Rodgers era.

If anything they should have a decent backup since Rodgers has also struggled with injuries in the latter part of his career.

I'm not happy with the trade up for Love (I'd be okay with it if it wasn't traded up but I still would have preferred a WR), but we addressed OL, and we have to have something planned for WR unless we're literally just going to ignore it."

Great arm talent, touch, and anticipation on throws. If he can figure out coverages and take care of the ball, he will be good. But Rodgers still has good years left and is owed a ton of money. After that idk what y'all were doing. No receivers is unforgivable and if the o-line picks bust, this draft was awful for y'all"
3422,2020-04-25 23:53:54,g838yy,"The Seahawks are one Wilson injury away from a wasted season, the Bucc's are a Tom Brady injury away from a wasted ""super team"", possible damaging the whole team again for multiple seasons, and the bears are one injury to Trubisky away from the playoffs."
3423,2020-04-28 19:11:00,g838yy,"Seahawks love trading back, and Love would have been a great target for anybody wanting him in their slot. I assumed they wanted to jump the Hawks to avoid getting in a bidding war with other teams. 

The fact the Seahawks didn't trade out of their slot makes me extra think this is true. They probably had a deal in place for a team that wanted Love and then it fell through with the Packers pick."

3426,2020-04-26 01:46:11,g838yy,Honestly I love Gruden.  He's not a bad coach by any means but damn is he entertaining.  He fits the Raiders well too.
3427,2020-04-26 01:04:53,g838yy,"Yeah the Hurts pick still has me spinning, but the rest of our draft went almost perfect."
3428,2020-04-26 05:40:51,g838yy,"It's not Rodgers versus Management, it's about the influence Rogers has within the management and coaching structure and the future of the team's offensive style.  For example, Peyton Manning had a tremendous amount of influence on Colts. Manning could bench players during a game or walk into the GMs office and get players traded or released. He had a lot of influence within the management.


I think there is some truth for McCarthy and Rogers not getting along during the later years, but even so Rogers was frustrated with the direction of the offense recently and was probably thought he would have way more influence with the new coach and GM.  because  hes fricking Arron Rogers one of the best QBs to play the game. How many times has he put the team on his back and carried them to wins?

But everything has changed, GB focused on defense recently and now the direction the team wants to take is not a high-flying offense. It looks like will be more hybrid with more runs and  check down passes. The message is clear, Rogers is getting older and his style of play is not winning championships anymore. Look at all the teams who have won the SB in the last 10 years... versatile and system teams that do many different things well, or defense focused teams. Even the 2015 SB winning Peyton Manning led Denver Broncos were a very defensive focused team, with a mediocre offense (Yes I know Chiefs this year, but they lucked into a massively good QB on rookie contact, lets see what happens to the team when he commands his full worth, you'll see many of their weapons go into FA)     

Believe me or don't but truth is the type of football Rogers plays to is out of style. There is no place for him and his LARGE salary anymore with the Packers. And of course the GM cant come out and tell one of the most iconic Packer's players ever it, but the is clear message... Rogers' days in Green Bay are going to be pretty mediocre so maybe he should request a trade if wants to end his career playing the style of offense he is suited for."

3447,2020-04-26 09:06:55,g838yy,They have no cap space for FA. FA is over for GB.
3448,2020-04-27 11:37:22,g838yy,"I think they’re just ok with less talent at WR given the new scheme we’re likely moving too. Gonna see a lot more 2TE sets, 2RB sets, more FB involvement. I bet most formations have 2WR, maybe 3 max. 

I assume they think one of Funchess, Lazard, EQ, MVS, Kumerow, Begelton will develop into a reliable #2 WR... we’ll see."
3449,2020-04-26 09:11:55,g838yy,"I could see them trading Love for a second next year, but then it's still a waste, just not as much of one."
3450,2020-04-26 09:13:51,g838yy,Even if Love is a bust it will still be a better pick than the 3rd rounder. QB is uncertain. the 3rd round FB is certain.
3451,2020-04-26 00:32:50,g838yy,Wilson brought a team held together by gauze and tongue depressors to the divisional round.
3452,2020-04-26 01:51:54,g838yy,Yeah he looked and sounded like an animatronic
3453,2020-04-26 06:37:33,g838yy,You can't even spell the guy's name correctly.

3455,2020-04-27 13:31:43,g838yy,"Thanks.  I don’t expect much from us this year but we will see.


I really was sad to see Cam go, but if Teddy is actually healed than he can be a pretty good QB."
3456,2020-04-26 01:17:10,g838yy,i tried playing some madden last week (mostly in an effort to not drop 150 bucks to get a copy of ncaa 14 on ebay...) and i'm rapidly realizing i've lost my touch with the game so i don't know if i'd be able to do that lol. would definitely be a tough goal depending on what position you're trying to get an MVP with
3457,2020-04-29 21:46:41,g838yy,Oh believe me I know. But first you gotta give Simmons the biggest bag anyone's ever seen.

3469,2020-04-26 13:11:16,g838yy,I see it more like insurance or protection in case Rodgers gets hurt or declines.
3470,2020-04-26 01:48:04,g838yy,Wilson is the team
3471,2020-04-26 04:28:34,g838yy,Eh I feel like if Wilson was out they'd still find a way to finish every game winning or losing within 5 points
3472,2020-04-26 06:41:09,g838yy,"ok well I guess there were just no great WR prospects and no additional critical thought should be applyed to this because I misspelled his name. 

You win this one."

3476,2020-04-27 05:21:25,g838yy,This one went underappreciated
3477,2020-04-26 14:27:14,g838yy,"I think he gives a shit about playing in the NFL for the same reason, he's literally only doing it for himself. If he divas a seventh-round pick, he's out. What's the point?"
3478,2020-04-26 15:13:19,g838yy,before rookies
3479,2020-04-26 13:13:00,g838yy,"If Rodgers gets hurt, the season is over.

Rodgers is too much of a dead cap hit for them to do anything but keep him on the the roster thru the 2023 season, so even if he ""falls off"", they'll keep him around.

This timing of this pick and Rodgers contract is what makes it so bad."
3480,2020-04-26 15:26:51,g838yy,"I see Jordan Love in over the cap, so it seems like they're including the rookies. I could be wrong, but it seems like they've got 11 mil and that's after the rookies. 

https://overthecap.com/salary-cap/green-bay-packers/"
3481,2020-04-26 13:28:52,g838yy,So there's absolutely no reason for them to build depth or have a reasonable response at backup then? Just pack it up and call off the rest of the season sounds like a good plan to you?
3482,2020-04-26 13:32:43,g838yy,"Love isn't good enough to go to the playoffs.

Unless you think the team can by running the ball 50 times a game."
3483,2020-04-26 13:37:54,g838yy,"Considering he has yet to play a single snap in the NFL and he will be learning behind one of the best QBs ever, I'm pretty sure everybody here is unqualified to make that assessment."
3484,2020-04-26 13:39:36,g838yy,"Love is a project QB. He's not ready to start. He needs at least 2 years on the bench, and Rodgers is for sure out of Green Bay before the 2024 season, but not before the 2023 season, so Love will be expected to start then. But until then he is definitely not ready."
3485,2020-06-25 21:35:38,hfs60u,Man Oh Man. Vernon at 51. Man Oh Man. What Am I Seeing.
3486,2020-06-25 21:36:58,hfs60u,Appreciate the effort you put into this
3487,2020-06-25 22:13:55,hfs60u,"Easily the best mock I’ve seen. Ramsey’s slip surprised me but the fits were very, very good across the board. 

Question: what are you referring to with PatWill’s  muscle imbalance?"
3488,2020-06-26 02:42:20,hfs60u,Pretty damn close to my ideal Wolves draft though the reasoning for picking Nesmith is a bit weird. After all our midseason trades we were one of the best 3pt shooting teams in the league.
3489,2020-06-25 19:39:09,hfs60u,"As a really big Cavs fan (since the early 90s) I don't like Wiseman at 2, I think you have to take Ball there

The Cavs are too early in the rebuild to start to draft for fit, the Cavs need to take highest ceiling guys till one hits, at which point you build around them for fit"
3490,2020-06-25 19:46:51,hfs60u,I would be annoyed if the Celtics took two draft and stash guys. We did that in 2016 and missed out on better players. Would rather trade up or even trade out.
3491,2020-06-25 21:39:53,hfs60u,"I like Terry a lot, though I do wish his shot off of movement was just a tad quicker. he’s gonna make the shots he takes but I can see bigger athletes giving him more trouble on those kinds of looks bc he doesn’t get a great amount of lift on his jumper and he’s already short. I feel like he’s gonna rose up boards in the process leading up to the draft. could see him going in Herro’s range last year"
3492,2020-06-26 00:17:22,hfs60u,"I like this fit at 22. But I think we can go with imo the BPA in Jalen Smith.

I think I would take Elijah hughes at 34.

Like this pick at 36 aswell but I would probably reach for Malachi Flynn.

I think the bpa at 49 would be Abdoulaye N'doye

Damn Wesson would've been my guy at 59 lol. But Yves Pons I would like to put on a Two-Way with this pick.

Also props for putting Saddiq on the Blazers. As a nova fan hope he goes there."
3493,2020-06-26 01:23:06,hfs60u,Yeah...no. No to Isaiah Stewart. Not a good fit for what the Jazz need or how they play.
3494,2020-06-25 22:57:11,hfs60u,"If the Raps take Riller with Tillman, Oturu, Nnaji, and Reed on the board, or take him over the better PGs in Dotson and Jones, man oh man I’d be pretty upset lol.

In all honesty I think you’ve got our picks backwards. More likely they take a big in the first and then a guard in the second."
3495,2020-06-26 04:39:30,hfs60u,"Not a fan of Ball’s fit with the Wolves. I’d prefer several other players at 3.

That said, really appreciate the effort here, this was an enjoyable read"
3496,2020-06-25 22:55:43,hfs60u,"I agree it's low but in all honesty, I'm not sure where else to slot him in. I doubt a team would take him simply because they view him as the ""Best Player Available"", because he needs a fairly specific infrastructure to succeed. I don't think it's crazy for him to fall out of the first round and most of the mocks I've seen lately have had Oturu ahead of him (though I disagree with that personally). Where do you think he should have went?"
3497,2020-06-25 23:10:41,hfs60u,Thank you
3498,2020-06-25 23:10:28,hfs60u,"Thank you. I'm a little concerned about Ramsey's decision-making and very concerned about his defensive IQ, but I can definitely see him going in the first if a team really buys the athleticism and shooting combo (maybe the Knicks at 27?). He's also not a good enough shooter off movement or off the dribble imo to bet on him as a 3pt specialist when Isaiah Joe is right there and is just better at so many things in my view.

Idk if ""imbalance"" is the right word but his legs are like almost too strong lol. He put on a lot of muscle in his legs in the last year or so and I think if he could trim down a little, it might help his lateral mobility. He really isn't a wing currently because I'm not sure if he's a fluid enough mover to guard guys on the perimeter, but if he could improve his lateral movement, he might be able to guard 2-4, and when coupled with his rim protection, he might be an incredible defender."
3499,2020-06-26 00:42:59,hfs60u,"drafting ball is just going to stall everyone’s development. garland and ball can’t be on the floor together, zero defense. Sexton needs the ball, KPJ needs the ball. you throw lamelo in there and that’s another guy who needs the ball and hurts everybody. 

Sexton looked amazing the second half of the year, KPJ is the best kept secret in the league, and garland moves the way an elite point guard moves (very similar to Brandon Ingram. Ingram looked amazing but the ball just wouldn’t go in). you need to get a guy like wiseman who can play defense bc right now they’re learning bad habits bc of how bad the team defense. 

lamelo isn’t that good of a prospect"
3500,2020-06-25 21:17:37,hfs60u,"Wiseman has an insanely high ceiling, arguably higher than Ball."
3501,2020-06-25 23:17:06,hfs60u,"Yeah I agree I definitely went back and forth on it. I would imagine the most likely move for Cleveland if they get #2 is to trade back, which makes sense to me. I think for some, Wiseman is justifiable at 2 because they see him as one of the better big man prospects over the past decade and a potential franchise changer, but I certainly don't view him that way."
3502,2020-06-26 08:48:48,hfs60u,Ball on that team will be a circus a core of 4 guards I’m sure ball will do everything not to get drafted by the cavs . No offense
3503,2020-06-25 22:59:46,hfs60u,"I would love to trade up as well. Killian Hayes would be my first choice by I'd be ecstatic for Cole Anthony or Tyrese Maxey as well, as we really need bench scoring. But Poku might not be a draft and stash; I think I saw something that he kinda wants to come over immediately, and if you can develop him properly, which I have faith that the Celtics will, you might end up with one of the top players in this draft when it's all said and done. Because the Celtics roster is already fairly well built, they can afford to take a high-upside gamble. And for Bolmaro, getting him at 26 is great value in my view, as I see him as a borderline lotto talent with some of the best upside in the class. These guys aren't Yabusele and Zizic. They have pretty high ceilings."
3504,2020-06-25 23:02:19,hfs60u,"Yeah he could very realistically go higher since that area from the late lotto to the early 20s isn't great in terms of reliable talent. I love the fit with Philly but New Orleans, Dallas, and Milwaukee could also be awesome. I guess in that case if I'm the Sixers I might look at Malachi Flynn at 22, even though that's pretty early for him, as that's also a great fit for their roster."
3505,2020-06-25 23:25:55,hfs60u,"Yeah that makes sense. I figured it's worth it to take the guard there because there's a sizeable drop-off in my view after Riller, Dotson, Mannion, and Jones, whereas you could possibly get a solid big man toward the end of the draft. I like Wesson, but they just as easily could have gone with Simonović for example, or go small with someone like Pons. If they grab a big in the first, they're probably left with like Pritchard, Powell, and Howard, and just don't think those guys are worth drafting. Also I think Riller is comfortably ahead of both Dotson and Jones. Jones doesn't really do anything special he's just a solid backup who plays good defense. A lot of Dotson's strengths are also Riller's strengths (specifically attacking the rim and finishing), and if anything, Riller is farther along in terms of those strengths and is just more likely to be a good pro."
3506,2020-06-26 13:01:50,hfs60u,"Who would you look at instead? I've seen Toppin to the Wolves a few times and I think that's a terrible fit. They might work offensively, but that is a disastrous defensive frontcourt. They won't be able to guard anyone. I've also seen Okongwu there, but I don't like that fit either. Part of the value of KAT is that he's as skilled as he is offensively for a center; by making him effectively play PF, I think you lose some of the advantages that he creates on the offensive end, plus I'm not sure if either Okongwu or KAT would be maximized defensively playing the 4. So you're basically either reaching for a wing (Deni, Vassell, Okoro) or taking another guard that probably doesn't fit super well with D'Lo, like Hayes. I'd rather just take the upside in Ball and move him later if you really want to."
3507,2020-06-25 22:59:03,hfs60u,"I wrote an essay about him and whenever you ask I can add more. Here you are (from the 3rd Paragraph). Anyway, I would take him between 20-30. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/NBASpurs/comments/he1msz/my_opinions_about_our_near_future/fvq8yoi?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share"
3508,2020-06-26 00:48:20,hfs60u,"There’s no way we re-sign both sexton and garland

I’m pretty high on garland too, I think he could play off ball due to his shooting

I think Collin could easily become a top 6th man getting 30 minutes and averaging 20

I think either can play with Ball

I have always loved big playmakers so I could be wrong on ball, what don’t you like? His form is off but he doesn’t have lonzo’s sweep which defenders just sit on and have kept him from shooting well in the nba, his playmaking is Rubio at least, his floater is really good and he can shoot it from outside the lane"
3509,2020-06-25 22:11:33,hfs60u,"I'm really high on Wiseman, I think he can be DeAndre Jordan with a jump shot which IMO would be a HOF level player.

I just think that Ball is more setup for success (depending on measurements big diff from a 6'5 PG and a 6'8 PG imo) as his handle, passing, and floater all set him up for a really great floor and if his jumper comes around (his range is already impressive, just his consistency) he could be a superstar"
3510,2020-06-26 14:31:04,hfs60u,"NBA players don’t refuse to go to teams, can’t remember the last time that happened, if he’s there and the Cavs want him he’ll be a cav 

The Cavs have had the worst record in the league the past two years, you don’t draft for fit in a terrible team you draft for talent"
3511,2020-06-27 17:53:30,hfs60u,"I'd rather take RJ Hampton than Poku with the MEM pick. He's a project too, but I like his chances of becoming something more than I do Poku, who I don't think will ever be physical enough to play at the NBA level. If he's around at 26 or 30, I'd be less opposed to swinging for him. Bolmaro would be a perfect stash guy for the Cs, but I'd rather take Jalen Smith in that 26 spot. Think he can be like another Theis. If they did go with Bolmaro at 26 though, I'd want Nnaji over Tillman I think. Grant Williams already does what Tillman does, but better. Nnaji has good size, runs the floor really well, and has nice touch. Needs to improve defensively, but Boston would be the perfect system for that. 

Good work on this overall though."
3512,2020-06-25 23:10:37,hfs60u,"Flynn is interesting, would rather wait on him in the 2nd round though. just want a guard that can dribble, pass and shoot. novel concepts for sixers guards"
3513,2020-06-25 23:31:16,hfs60u,"I'm just not a big Riller fan due to his non existent defence and subpar playmaking for a point guard. Dotson and Jones are both superior in those areas and Dotson is similar offensively (I believe he can shoot and that his bad 3 pt % this year is just poor sample size.)

At the end of the 2nd they could also go with Sam Merrill, who while an older guard, can at least fill out the backup PG role with his all around play and good shooting. Or they could just not pick a PG at all and select a wing to back up Anunoby next year. The Raps believe Davis can be a point guard so they may just stay away from that position this year."
3514,2020-06-26 02:45:42,hfs60u,With as much enthusiasm I've seen you have for this guy you could probably make a pretty good post on this sub analyzing him.
3515,2020-06-26 00:50:17,hfs60u,you can’t possibly know that. they’re going to resign sexton so that’s 3 years of them together at least

He had more wins, more point share, many more saves, but Rask won via a slightly better sv% and a much better GAA.  
But Rask has a Selke winner, Norris finalist and a presidents trophy team in front of him.

Somehow the script was always flipped when we fit either criteria 2011 and 16 for supposed to being bad and being a surprise team. Meanwhile in 2013 they win the presidents trophy with one of the most dominant seasons in the cap era and they give it to Maclean who was fired the very next year"

3665,2020-06-23 06:10:16,he38ow,Yeah that confused me as well. I believe his only tie to the US is that his dad grew up in the US Virgin Islands and played college hoops in Georgia and thus he is ineligible. It is also confirmed by reporter Brian Sciaretta. I believe he may be eligible for Trinidad and Tobago through his dad though but that’s a deep cut haha.

It was on an island next to his, apparently this island was the only landing strip for miles and for people and their islands this was a better, more private entry point.

Well I noticed that there were these 2 GORGEOUS dogs in the island that chased everything, they were definitely living their best life. These dogs were mocha hibiscus latte drinkers while the other dogs were clearly rougher, island dogs. I asked the owners brother about them and apparently they were new dogs, maybe a few months. They looked like panthers!

Apparently when Tyler flew onto the island to get to his(mind you this is a super small island and it has a very very VERY small landing strip). As he was landing 2 of the previous dogs were running up to the plane and well...let's just say planes will always win against dogs. Splat.

Tyler is so upset that as recompense the only thing he can do is buy this guy 2 more dogs. So he does. Each dog was $10,000!

He did not fly the plane but he tried to make it right. All in all everyone said he was a decent guy"

What do you think happens if someone tases you who is dangerous? are you then safe even if the person tasing you is dangerous? maybe they leave you alone after tasing you, but maybe they dont."

He resisted arrest for drunk driving, fought two officers, ripped a tazer out of the hands of one of them, started to run away, shot the tazer at the head of one of the officers, then was shot and killed by the other.  He was on probation for domestic abuse charges and this second DUI charge would have put him back in jail.

3779,2020-06-18 14:00:54,hbbpwr,Yeah and if I'm recalling correctly he's said that he'll keep making the movies if people keep seeing them and that he uses the money he makes to do things like this.

3790,2020-06-18 15:09:04,hbbpwr,"Nope, their job is to protect the public. The funniest part to me is the Atlanta DA literally stated just a few weeks ago that tasers are lethal. But when it comes to a cop protecting himself, they are not lethal. 

I’m glad those little girls will get a chance to go to college. I’m sorry their father died but he’s been charged with child brutality which is a fact I cannot overlook."

He would have sobered up, realized how bad he fucked up, and come home. What other choice did he have? They would have got him in the end, all they had to do was a little police work and they would have gotten him. 

For that matter, he was on probation. They could have snatched him up at his next probation meeting. Or his probation officer could have called him and told him to turn himself in, or gone to his house and picked him up.

3902,2020-06-18 15:22:54,hbbpwr,"You could've ended it at resist arrest. Any deviation from protocol and your life is forfeit because we'd be lucky if they even miss a paycheck for deviating from protocol, but so much as flinch and you should at least get a felony."
3903,2020-06-18 15:39:17,hbbpwr,Sleeping in his car is breaking the law? K
3904,2020-06-18 15:13:08,hbbpwr,Of course he should be allowed to flee if there is no way to stop him other than killing him. Make the arrest another day. There should be repercussions for attacking officers but extrajudicial death is not one of them unless someone else’s life is on the line at that moment (which does not appear to be the case). I wasn’t there. But if the fundamental question is whether he should be shot to prevent him from “getting away” then I would say absolutely not. I don’t see what his shittiness as a person has to do with that.

3906,2020-06-18 15:06:02,hbbpwr,"So that warrants a death sentence? He was running away and they shot him in back. The guy needed to be in jail, not killed."
3907,2020-06-18 14:31:10,hbbpwr,"Or buy a machine gun and kill 50 people. Or steal a plane and crash it into a building. Or mix gasoline and fertilizer and blow up a building. Or become a mercenary and join the French Foreign Legion. We could speculate about a million things that he might have done but almost certainly wouldn't have. You can't summarily execute someone based on your limited imagination.

The one thing that is pretty certain is that he would eventually sober up and go home to his wife and kids."
3908,2020-06-18 15:30:19,hbbpwr,"You can ‘deal’ with a person without killing them, and to think otherwise is barbaric. Do you really place such little value on human life? 

Two armed and trained police officers versus a single drunk and disorientated bloke, and the *only * option they have is to kill him? Not use the other taser they have between them? Or run after him? Or follow in their vehicle (Americans are apparently good at following running men in their cars)? Or call for backup? 

What a savage nation."
3909,2020-06-18 15:03:58,hbbpwr,"So he shot the single use taser, and yet he was still a threat? Right..."
3910,2020-06-18 14:31:30,hbbpwr,"Its illegal to taze a fleeing subject, but to you its legal to shoot a fleeing one...?"
3911,2020-06-18 14:47:37,hbbpwr,That's the fucking problem.
3912,2020-06-18 14:57:14,hbbpwr,Then the laws are unjust.
3913,2020-06-18 14:56:32,hbbpwr,"You speak you like you know what you’re talking about, which is is very strange considering that I have indeed lived in third world ‘shitholes’ for a good part of my life. The similarities between the US and them are indeed shocking in how their police behave. 

Using force to stop a PERSON is only necessary if they pose a threat. This guy had a used taser and was running. The cops either 1) are too unfit to chase a drunkard, so shouldn’t be serving or 2) too lazy to their jobs properly and chase a running man down. 

I’m not advocating ‘letting him run away’ but treating people like people. This man did not forfeit his life with his actions. Maybe if the cops acted more like first world rather than third world cops, he would still be alive."
3914,2020-06-18 15:36:27,hbbpwr,Okay Hammurabi
3915,2020-06-18 14:58:01,hbbpwr,Running from the cops is punishable by death? Even in states without the death penalty?
3916,2020-06-18 15:03:22,hbbpwr,"He wasn’t actively shooting when he was killed, he was running away after using a single-use taser. He possed no threat. 

A very different situation to a gangster shootout."
3917,2020-06-18 14:28:17,hbbpwr,Endangering lives with a taser that had already shot off both its charges? In the end the cops actions will be considered lawful but awful. The guy didn’t have to die.
3918,2020-06-18 14:37:01,hbbpwr,"They stood over his body and didn’t give first aid for over two minutes after they shot him. They stood there and watched him bleed out on the ground. This goes against all police training and it was malicious.

Regardless of whether you think the shooting itself was justified, they let this man bleed out on purpose. They wanted him to die."
3919,2020-06-18 14:31:53,hbbpwr,They shot him the fucking back as he was running away. What fucking cowards to be scared from a fleeing man
3920,2020-06-18 14:11:57,hbbpwr,"But the taser was already fired twice, was useless, and he was shot in the back. The cop likely will get off for it. But he should never have authority and a gun again, he can’t handle it. As shown by the half dozen previous complaints against him."
3921,2020-06-18 14:22:04,hbbpwr,This is what I thought but the US doesn’t classify them as lethal so I didn’t include it
3922,2020-06-18 14:15:09,hbbpwr,"Being killed in fact makes you the victim especially if/when the shooting might not be justified. 

Had he stolen the police officer’s gun it would have been a different story _but that isn’t what happened so this hypothetical is at best entirely pointless_.

The police are obligated to deescalate so the 45 minutes was them actually doing their job."
3923,2020-06-18 14:15:56,hbbpwr,As none of that happened it is pointless to bring it up.
3924,2020-06-18 14:01:48,hbbpwr,"Nice being able to break down the situation mentally well after the fact, isn't it?"
3925,2020-06-18 14:04:57,hbbpwr,"So the cop should wait to be tased and have his service weapon stolen and his life ended to defend himself?
Perfectly logical from a criminal mindset.

Try this, if you assault a police officer you will be shot and killed. Everyone knows this and I approve of every shooting of anyone attacking a police officer regardless of race or religion."
3926,2020-06-18 14:29:40,hbbpwr,"We have so many perfect cops in the community, they just don’t want to be LE."
3927,2020-06-18 14:49:10,hbbpwr,I’ve officially read the stupidest thing I’ll ever read.
3928,2020-06-18 15:38:25,hbbpwr,"A taser is a lethal weapon. It’s also known as a stun gun.

Hence “gun”."
3929,2020-06-18 14:16:36,hbbpwr,If taser is lethal force then why do police use it so liberally. Because it’s not. That’s a bs statement and cops don’t get to have it both ways. You can hide behind precedent or policy or whatever nonsense that cops usually use to get away with shit but the truth is that they shot him because they didn’t want him to get away. Because they didn’t want to lose. And I’d really take a look at yourself if you take such rancid pride in ignoring common sense to defend a murder.
3930,2020-06-18 13:20:42,hbbpwr,[removed]
3931,2020-06-18 13:52:16,hbbpwr,Where did you hear that from?
3932,2020-06-18 14:00:36,hbbpwr,"So what, you just want to let a man who was drunk driving, resisting arrest, and posing a threat to the officers with a less-lethal but still very lethal weapon to run away and expect the officers to just let him?"
3933,2020-06-18 15:00:08,hbbpwr,"No, the DA said the cop knew that. I haven’t found one statement from the officer saying he knew that."
3934,2020-06-18 14:05:42,hbbpwr,"It’s not your miscatergorization. It’s your fundamental misunderstanding of what a taser can do. 

It’s supposed to incapacitate you. If he wasn’t shot, and successfully tased the cop, he could’ve turned around, grabbed the cops gun and executed both officers. 

Nothing good was going to come out of this situation."
3935,2020-06-18 14:30:18,hbbpwr,"I’ve seen many people label him as a hero. Granted, that is not necessarily the public consensus. As someone who strongly (I can’t stress how strongly I feel that it is necessary) supports an increase of police training and accountability, I think situations like this are a side that the “reform the police” crowd can learn from.  

We know the police need to take constrictive criticism and have measures taken to change, however when someone tases a police officer, that should be expressly condemned by the people on that side of the movement, it will really hurt the movement and will hurt cooperation between both sides. It gives the impression that the “reform the police” crowd selectively chooses what the police do and ignores any wrong doing of citizens. 

It’s insane that I saw Instagram stories for two days talking about how this man was another tragedy, which while tragic, it was not even noted what he did during the altercation. Both sides need to improve and condemn wrong doing everywhere, and it’s often not happening on both sides"
3936,2020-06-18 13:58:58,hbbpwr,I don’t think the debate should be whether or not he was a hero because he clearly isn’t. The talk should be about the officer and how he is facing the death penalty for simply doing his job the way he was suppose to. I’ve seen soooo many police shootings that have been justified without question and this one should be one of those. This isn’t the first time a Blackman that did what he did was shot in the back and it won’t be the last. The officer shouldn’t get what he’s about to get.
3937,2020-06-18 15:50:30,hbbpwr,"It’s not relevant. So let’s completely remove it from the equation. 

What does is that he got pulled over for drunk driving, went for a cop’s lethal weapon (yes a taser is considered that), then got shot.

Although his past is a good indicator of who he is. People who beat up children and THEN get pulled over for drunk driving ON PAROLE generally aren’t good people. If this guy was white I’d be calling him white trash.

This event being covered as police brutality discredits the BLM movement. Real events of police brutality happen every fucking day. This being covered as one pisses me off to no end, because this is the kinda stuff that backfires on the movement. This covering this as police brutality shifts the definition into something even slightly justified."
3938,2020-06-18 15:37:40,hbbpwr,"I’m just making the connection. It’s absolutely absurd that people say it’s racist that someone looked into the dude and found out he got charged with cruelty to his kids. Are we supposed to accept these kinds of traits in people based on the color of their skin? No. I don’t know about you, but that kind of charge isn’t commonplace where I’m from."
3939,2020-06-18 15:49:16,hbbpwr,After drunk driving to a McDonald's....yes so is resisting arrest.
3940,2020-06-18 15:51:19,hbbpwr,You're conveniently leaving out the fact that he was asleep at the wheel of a car that was in line at the drive through...yes operating a vehicle while drunk is a crime.
3941,2020-06-18 15:32:12,hbbpwr,"So, he should be allowed to flee and possibly drive drunk or do worse while drunk? This puts others at risk."
3942,2020-06-18 15:19:48,hbbpwr,"The “should be allowed to flee” opinion you have is not a law, nor will it ever be one when you start fighting a cop and use his weapon against him. A total pipe dream. You don’t live in reality and are now wholeheartedly defending a child abuser. 

Think about that. You wanna defend a man that beats children. Something is very wrong with you"
3943,2020-06-18 15:19:03,hbbpwr,I believe the taser had two total shots that could be fired.
3944,2020-06-18 15:22:59,hbbpwr,"Ah man you’re right an officer is just supposed to decide in the heat of the moment that someone who just shot a taser at him is just gonna peacefully surrender himself after he missed. 

Are you really going to claim it was a “revenge” killing? What is your basis for that Mr. Lawyer? Can you disprove any claims of self-defense by the officer and prove it was a “revenge” killing? I figured if you’re a lawyer these kinds of things matter but admittedly idk how the law “industry” works.

FYI I think Chauvin deserves life in jail or the death penalty. I’m not a police stan. I’m not justifying the killing, I think it’s ridiculous the officer here got fired and is facing murder charges."
3945,2020-06-18 15:18:05,hbbpwr,"Nope, he turned and fired at a police officer.  The officer fired back.  It's sad that a human being died, but he chose his own path.  Even the District Attorney said that a taser is a ""Lethal weapon"" in late May.

According to Georgia law, a person is justified in using deadly force “If he or she reasonably believes that such force is necessary to prevent death or great bodily injury to himself or herself or a third person.”"
3946,2020-06-18 15:09:43,hbbpwr,You conveniently left out the part where Brooks fired a stolen taser at an officer’s face
3947,2020-06-18 15:37:33,hbbpwr,"In the Heat of the Moment, after wrestling with this guy already, the cop was suppose to look down and make sure he wasn’t hit? For all he knew he could’ve been hit and the guy just hasn’t sent the shock through yet. It’s easy to be critical while watching a video at home but the truth is he was using what the DA called “lethal force” on a cop and the cop responded with lethal force."
3948,2020-06-18 15:24:00,hbbpwr,You aren’t fucking fleeing if you SHOOT FIRST

3950,2020-06-18 14:45:10,hbbpwr,He wasn’t fleeing he was fighting and literally pointed the taser at the officer
3951,2020-06-18 15:16:53,hbbpwr,I thought they said he fired the taser and it was a 2 charge one. Even the street/building video suggests it.

3953,2020-06-18 15:39:19,hbbpwr,Sure you’d be feeling the same if the taser made contact aswell huh.
3954,2020-06-18 15:10:20,hbbpwr,He fired moments before being shot so that's like claiming because a gangster wasn't firing his uzi at the exact moment he was shot he wasn't a threat
3955,2020-06-18 14:35:17,hbbpwr,endangering MULTIPLE lives by drunk driving to the extent where he was passed out in his vehicle. He didn’t. But he didn’t have to escalate the situation to the point he did.
3956,2020-06-18 14:40:01,hbbpwr,[removed]
3957,2020-06-18 14:37:09,hbbpwr,"What if he had a weapon other than the taser he stole? Don’t be naive. What if he were to get back in the vehicle he was driving drunk? That would endanger the lives of a lot of people, especially with protesters being out."
3958,2020-06-18 14:50:00,hbbpwr,[deleted]
3959,2020-06-18 14:29:50,hbbpwr,I’m not here to argue about that I just think people should be aware that tasers can be deadly. It is dangerous to assume otherwise.
3960,2020-06-18 14:25:48,hbbpwr,If brooks wasn’t drunk driving that day none of this wouldn’t have happened. Just don’t break the fucking law. How hard is it to get an uber? Any human that drives drunk is a shitty human.
3961,2020-06-18 14:50:35,hbbpwr,"If someone points a gun at you and you're pretty sure that it doesn't have any bullets in it, that's okay I assume? You want to stake your life on the idea that a taser can only be fired twice? What if your partner had a 3 shot taser that you didn't know about?"
3962,2020-06-18 14:40:47,hbbpwr,Nope. He was the aggressor. Being the aggressor disqualifies you from being the victim.
3963,2020-06-18 14:24:00,hbbpwr,You’re insane if you don’t think it’s relevant. Violent offenders have one of the highest reoffending percentages(63.8%). You can definitely see a pattern.
3964,2020-06-18 14:23:25,hbbpwr,"It's called prevention. You don't wait for the repeat violent offender to run into someone's house or to take the Wendy's employee as a hostage. He was violent, he was irratic, he was armed, and he had just fired a weapon at police. You have to assume he will escalate because that is all he's done since the incident began. 
If a criminal comes at you with his fists up then you pepper spray him. If he comes with a stick you taser him. But if he's been fighting you, takes your partners weapon and has now fired it at you the only choice is to eliminate the threat before he has a chance to escalate the violence yet again"
3965,2020-06-18 14:22:28,hbbpwr,That doesn’t make the post I was replying to valid
3966,2020-06-18 14:22:06,hbbpwr,"Amen. If you want them to be officers of the peace, it is in everyone's societal contract to defend that peace as well."
3967,2020-06-18 14:20:32,hbbpwr,"Had his service weapon been taken that would have significantly changed things.  That being said the Rayshard never took the police officer’s gun so it is pointless, at best, to bring that up.

In fact many officers get assaulted and they do not shoot the person assaulting them.  Just watch videos of protestors hitting police officers and notice how very few officers draw their weapons and fire.  

Attacking a police officer does not justify a lethal response in almost all situations just like a police officer illegally attacking a person does not justify shooting the police officer."
3968,2020-06-18 15:08:39,hbbpwr,Then you should read more.  It might give you a hint as to the use of contractions.
3969,2020-06-18 14:28:45,hbbpwr,"Hey, doctor here. Taser can totally kill you. Literally just search ""can a taser kill you"" on google and you'll find multiple instances of tasers killing people (usually with heart conditions, tbf). Police consider them non-lethal force because they usually are. But imagine if the taser hits you in the eye - your eye is gone. Tbh if someone pointed a taser at me, I would consider that an attempt on my life and livlihood and would retaliate as best I could. Would you not?"
3970,2020-06-18 14:35:28,hbbpwr,"Don’t waste your time with this guy, even the right wing subreddits he posts on think he’s just a troll."

3972,2020-06-18 13:55:29,hbbpwr,Love how people chime in without actual research... Go read about the case.
3973,2020-06-18 14:10:36,hbbpwr,"Does anyone deserve the death penalty for any of the crimes you’ve listed (resisting arrest, evading arrest, drunk driving, possibly felony assault on a police officer)? Would you agree it to be fair and just if you were sentenced to death for committing any of those crimes yourself?"
3974,2020-06-18 14:14:42,hbbpwr,"Weapon was discharged so not lethal at all. Last I checked, none of those crimes are capital crimes in the state of Georgia. And the police aren't judge, jury, and executioner. You chase him. He gets away, you let him go and issue a warrant. Arrest him when he sobers up. 

Not saying he was a great guy  but he didn't deserve to die for anything he did that night. There was no need for lethal force here."
3975,2020-06-18 15:04:58,hbbpwr,Maybe you should google it... I sure can.
3976,2020-06-18 14:14:20,hbbpwr,You’re insinuating that a man deserved to be extrajudicially sentenced to death based on a hypothetical scenario. He was running away. He wa shot in the back. The officer who shot Rayshsrd has 12 previous misconduct complaints. He has been charged with murder.
3977,2020-06-18 14:45:41,hbbpwr,"No one is saying that he didn’t deserve to be punished for committing a crime. However, that punishment shouldn’t have been death. The movement isn’t about focusing on perfect people killed by cops. If it was we would be hard pressed to find many instances. The whole point is that police are too quick to resort to killing. That includes people who did commit a crime but still didn’t deserve to die. In Europe they have a fraction of the people killed by police as us, there has to be a reason for that. Not every story is about a complete innocent being killed, but even people who commit crimes deserve to not be shot at unnecessarily. 

It sounds like you agree that the police need massive reform. That reform should apply to everyone equally. We shouldn’t discount someone being unjustly killed because they were a criminal. His death still speaks to the reform needed in the system. If the officers were better trained at deescalation, or if an unarmed officer had responded to the non violent call, perhaps the situation could have ended differently."
3978,2020-06-18 14:05:37,hbbpwr,"It’s not doing your job to shoot someone who’s running away and doesn’t pose a physical threat. The officer was in fact aware that two taser shots had been fired, and the weapon no longer posed any danger. 

If you’re trying to argue that they teach them to shoot people who aren’t a threat then that’s a whole different discussion."
3979,2020-06-18 15:46:08,hbbpwr,"> Are we supposed to accept these kinds of traits in people based on the color of their skin?

Nobody is asking you to do that. Just an explanation for what it has to do with the justification of the shooting would be nice."
3980,2020-06-18 15:37:53,hbbpwr,"Didn’t they have his car? And yes, my opinion is that the punishment for fleeing while drunk should not be death, even if you’ve assaulted someone."
3981,2020-06-18 15:35:55,hbbpwr,"I don’t think it’s allowed to use lethal force to stop someone just for fleeing, and if it is then that should be changed. But I suppose I don’t know enough to say. 

I live in reality. I understand why you feel the way you do. But I think bad people still have the right to live. I’m a doctor, and I’ve provided medical care to a lot of bad people. Including someone I knew to be a child abuser, in fact. They aren’t any less deserving of my help just because they’ve done bad things, because it’s my duty to help everyone. This guy was a bad guy. He was a shitty person and deserved punishment for the things he had done. My issue is that I think lethal force should be restricted to life-or-death situations only, which it doesn’t appear this was. If he was able to get away, then he should be found and brought to justice. But not killed for running. 

I hope you can understand where I’m coming from even if you continue to disagree."
3982,2020-06-18 15:12:46,hbbpwr,That doesn’t warrant a death sentence either.
3983,2020-06-18 15:49:08,hbbpwr,"And in the Heat of the Moment, that guy should’ve just complied after weeks of protests of people being unjustly killed for no particular reason? For all he knew, the cops were about to suffocate him in the streets. It’s easy to be critical while hearing the accounts of the survivors, but the truth is he was using what biologists call ‘fight or flight’ instincts to preserve his life whilst disorientated, and for that he was murdered."

3987,2020-06-18 14:48:21,hbbpwr,"So use lethal force when faced with non lethal.

Bunch of fucking cowards in here."
3988,2020-06-18 15:18:34,hbbpwr,"He was fleeing. The podcast “The Daily” put out an episode just yesterday titled “The killing of Rayshard Brooks” where they broke down the contents of the body cam on one of the police officers from the moment the officer got out of his cruiser and started the interaction with him. It was all very calm for about 15ish minutes even when the second officer showed up. Lots of deescalation and talking. Rayshard even said he could just walk to his sister’s house from there and they insisted in keeping him in custody, not arrested. It’s very gray-ish area sorta situation but he was fleeing and was shot from the back by one of two officers. You should listen to it."
3989,2020-06-18 15:21:26,hbbpwr,"So he fired the taser, ran away, and then turned around to fire it again? Whilst being drunk enough to have fallen asleep in his car? 

The fact that the man was offscreen when he was shot means these things cannot be established for certain, unless body camera video can be produced which disputes it."
3990,2020-06-18 15:13:14,hbbpwr,"You do know theres more than one Third World experience, right? I’m sure the criminal situation in your country would be made BETTER by cops shooting every fighty drunkard on the street. That totally wouldn’t alienate them from the population and drive further divisions in your society. Not at all."
3991,2020-06-18 15:47:12,hbbpwr,Definitely. The penalty for murder or attempted murder ain’t death in most civilised countries.
3992,2020-06-18 15:17:20,hbbpwr,"No, the CCTV footage clearly shows him pop the taser and then run out of frame, followed a few seconds later by gunshots. 

The *police* claimed he was shot when he fired it, but the parking lot cameras suggest otherwise."
3993,2020-06-18 14:49:23,hbbpwr,Was he drunk driving when shot?
3994,2020-06-18 14:54:02,hbbpwr,So DUIs are worthy of trial-less execution now? 😂
3995,2020-06-18 14:54:03,hbbpwr,"Oh I didnt know he was fleeing in a car, the video I say he was fleeing on foot...?"
3996,2020-06-18 14:49:46,hbbpwr,"The drunk driving is irrelevant to his killing. No cop should ever dish out punishment for any crime. Once they do they are violating your civil rights. The only people that can punish a criminal are judges and juries. 

You’re right he didn’t have to escalate, and seemed compliant for most of it. Not sure what caused the escalation at the end, but it took two to tango there I’m sure"
3997,2020-06-18 14:48:18,hbbpwr,"According to the info we have, he was already patted down to check for weapons and he had none.  Not defending him but not a good point."
3998,2020-06-18 14:53:06,hbbpwr,"If he had a gun then the shooting would have been justified, but he didnt so its irrelevant..."
3999,2020-06-18 14:56:13,hbbpwr,He fired a TASER they fired GUNS into his BACK as he ran away.
4000,2020-06-18 14:58:33,hbbpwr,They fired after literally all of the danger was gone. Try again.
4001,2020-06-18 14:33:34,hbbpwr,Maybe officers shouldn’t have them then. And they definitely shouldn’t lose them so easily ina struggle with a guy who was so drunk he couldn’t even order a spicy chicken.
4002,2020-06-18 14:29:07,hbbpwr,"The penalty for drunk driving is not death on the street. We have a criminal justice system for a reason. Any human who drives drunk deserves to be punished by a judge, not a cop"
4003,2020-06-18 14:42:24,hbbpwr,So if I shoot a LEO who starts a fight with me they aren’t a victim?  What if they decide the police were 100% in the wrong for shooting Brooks?
4004,2020-06-18 14:28:57,hbbpwr,That has no logical bearing on the situation.  The only thing that matter is what ACTUALLY happened.  Brooks DID NOT TAKE THE POLICE OFFICER’S GUN so bringing it up is at best indicative of poor thinking.
4005,2020-06-18 14:26:39,hbbpwr,"He fired a single shot taser that missed.  At the point he was shot the only thing he could do was throw the taser at them.  He wasn’t a threat to their lives and they had other options they did not take.

Everything about the “what if he took their gun” argument is at best a distraction from the facts as it never happened.  At worst it is justification for the police wrongly killing Brooks."
4006,2020-06-18 14:25:04,hbbpwr,"Your reply doesn't make the post you were replying to invalid.  Reality doesn't take place in a frame by frame replay, it happens in real time and context is everything when it comes to objective evaluation and judgement of the circumstances."
4007,2020-06-18 14:33:58,hbbpwr,Defending that peace means not killing people who aren’t at the moment a lethal threat.  What is lethal about a taser once it has been fired?
4008,2020-06-18 15:13:05,hbbpwr,"Hey Doc, you’re right. A pair of scissors are also lethal in my hands.
The criminal attacked a cop and stripped him of his taser and I believe his shooting was justified. 
I think we are on the same page."
4009,2020-06-18 14:31:27,hbbpwr,"I’m aware, but a lot of things CAN kill you. But no I wouldn’t. Interesting thought, if a police officer attempted to taser you, would you defend your life?

Edit: I just to specify, my problem is that police shouldn’t be able to say that tasers are lethal force when they are threatened with it, then claim they aren’t when they want to use them on people."
4010,2020-06-18 14:36:42,hbbpwr,Fair enough
4011,2020-06-18 14:41:42,hbbpwr,That's a quote from the (corrupt) DA who is charging the officers and is in no way proof that that is what the officers actually thought at the time of the shooting.
4012,2020-06-18 13:56:21,hbbpwr,Says the guy who chimes in without doing any research.
4013,2020-06-18 14:40:10,hbbpwr,"I'm as liberal as they come, and a white person and I'm pretty sure if I pointed a weapon at a police officer let alone a weapon i just stole from them at them, even if it was a taser (which can kill or maim - easy google search, your decision if the police should be using them or not), I would expect to be shot by the police."
4014,2020-06-18 14:21:33,hbbpwr,"Police officers often act on first instinct when nervous or angry. You really kind of have to put yourself in the shoes of the officer and really think to yourself “if I were in this situation, how would I react?” After a man assaults you, takes your weapon and runs away, the first thing to come to mind won’t be “issue a warrant” it’ll probably be “stop him now.”"
4015,2020-06-18 14:20:22,hbbpwr,"He was not just running away. You do know he tried/was going to tase the cop, right? 

You conveniently leave that part out."
4016,2020-06-18 14:59:43,hbbpwr,"It's not a hypothetical, it has happened before. Two police officers have been shot in this same scenario because they didn't shoot the guy."
4017,2020-06-18 14:52:47,hbbpwr,"Oh definitely, I agree. I thjnk I said in that comment or a prior one that it was an unjust killing even though he wasn’t perfect.

I guess, to clarify what I’m saying: the wrong doing of Rayshard is being glossed over on social media (can’t comment on the news, haven’t watched). I thjnk he was unjustly killed and I think the cops should be held to a higher standard than citizens. The main point I’m making is that when all that happens, it will be perceived as the “reform police” people only criticizing police. I think the best way to agree and initiate change is to take ownership of the wrongdoings “your” group does too. 

The police need to do this WAY more, however the police/pro-police people will cling to this, which I’ve already seen, and say “you guys don’t care about citizens resisting arrest and assaulting police officers, you just want to punish police.” 

I think that can hurt the argument. And I’m sure that my social media feed isn’t indicative of the whole conversation, I just think it will help"
4018,2020-06-18 14:54:40,hbbpwr,"Also I say that because I’ve grown up with stubborn people, which the pro police crowd is in my opinion because they don’t want basic checks and balances. It’s A LOT easier to win and compromise when you throw them a bone at a proper time. Otherwise they’ll dig their heels in and say “you only care about this, but you don’t focus on the bad of your side”"
4019,2020-06-18 14:28:22,hbbpwr,The drunk man with a record of domestic abuse doesn’t get to run away with a taser that he stole from police. Black or white shooting him was what he had coming.
4020,2020-06-18 15:49:51,hbbpwr,"I mean... it doesn’t. It was a response to what you’re saying. It does relate to the overall attention this guy is getting. He’s being praised as a hero which he definitely was not. When it comes to the shooting, he attempted to grab the officers weapon and did in fact grab his taser. What do you expect the cop to do?"
4021,2020-06-18 15:30:54,hbbpwr,Luckily the same DA that charged some other police also 2 weeks ago said that Tasers are deadly weapons.

4026,2020-06-18 15:40:53,hbbpwr,"He fired it while running.

You say offscreen, that's only the original video from the car, there is another video from a building corner that is much clearer and shows the entire thing with him running, holding the taser backwards directly at the cop (5 meters) and firing.

4029,2020-06-18 14:31:35,hbbpwr,The penalty for endangering an officers life is. I don’t agree with it but that’s what they state.
4030,2020-06-18 14:40:40,hbbpwr,i have long been over the belief that every instance of intoxicated driving should come with an automatic charge of attempted manlaughter. to drive while intoxicated is to irresponsibly wield a deadly weapon. whether you end up in an accident or killing someone is irrelevant.
4031,2020-06-18 14:34:19,hbbpwr,That information is very relevant. But disregarding the power of a taser is very indicative of poor thinking. Allowing yourself to ignore facts to push a narrative is indicative of poor thinking. Dude clearly didn’t give a shit about his safety or anyone else’s.
4032,2020-06-18 14:30:51,hbbpwr,"That wasn't the only thing he could do. He was unpredictable and now determined to get away. I could list possible outcomes but you don't like to talk about bad things until after they've actually happened. I watched that video from start to finish, the police didn't escalate that situation."
4033,2020-06-18 14:32:53,hbbpwr,"In fact my post is valid which means the conclusion logically flows from the premise.  As Brooks never took the officer’s gun any speculation on what could/should have happened is immaterial as it did not happen.  Putting forth the question as to what would have happened had Brooks taken the officer’s gun has the same logical value as asking what if Brooks turned into Voltron at that moment as neither situation happened. 

You seem to not have understood what validity is.  Hopefully I have explained that effectively."
4034,2020-06-18 15:14:44,hbbpwr,That it can incapacitate you and have your service weapon stripped and then you’d be killed with it. Just tase yourself and you’ll see.
4035,2020-06-18 15:18:52,hbbpwr,"Yeah I mean, it’s really sad. No one needed to die here, but even if it was a scissors, you can’t brandish a weapon and expect to not be taken seriously. Very sad"
4036,2020-06-18 15:11:53,hbbpwr,The DA said the taser was lethal when a cop used it and you are saying it isn’t when a criminal used it. GTFO.
4037,2020-06-18 14:51:53,hbbpwr,The taser had been fired twice and was no longer a danger. If the officers weren’t aware of that then it’s their fault for not paying attention.
4038,2020-06-18 13:57:29,hbbpwr,I certainly did.
4039,2020-06-18 14:44:02,hbbpwr,He was shot in the back. How dumb are you that you dont know if you are running in the opposite direction you are not allowed to be shot?
4040,2020-06-18 14:40:56,hbbpwr,"He was at some point running away. Regardless or whether he tried to tase the cop, he did not. He was shot in the back. The officer has been charged with murder."
4041,2020-06-18 15:03:57,hbbpwr,"Thanks for clearing that up, we seem to be in agreement. People who refuse to admit that he was committing a crime are harming the cause. We have to hear all the facts and be open to receiving information we may not like to hear in order for things to be fair."
4042,2020-06-18 14:33:41,hbbpwr,"The taser wasn’t charged and the police knew that it posed no danger to them. So what, they shot him because they felt like he deserved it? He commuted a crime so it’s what he has coming? That’s not how the justice system works."
4043,2020-06-18 15:33:32,hbbpwr,"Ooof, I wonder if they regret that now. There’s still ways to argue around that, but that is a pretty big blow to the argument that this wasn’t self defense."
4044,2020-06-18 15:04:09,hbbpwr,"Actually I am, which is how I know you aren’t, because you have a fundamental misconception of what self defense means. Anyways, I’m not actually taking a side here because I don’t believe this to be a cut and dry case no matter how you slice it, but the amount of people arguing in this thread about what the law is from a misinformed (at best) point of view is amusing."

“HAHAHAHA”"
4047,2020-06-18 15:13:02,hbbpwr,"So you aren’t actually arguing against the facts I brought up. Cool.

Cops aren’t “normal people”, they are paid for, equipped, and given power by the people. Their job is not judge jury executioner, it’s de-escalate and detain as primary option. They knew the danger had passed and still chose to shoot him in the back. And then make crass comments, and then kick the bleeding out man, and also not provide medical attention in the time they are required to."
4048,2020-06-18 15:18:14,hbbpwr,He had already deployed the taser and missed both officers rendering it useless. You’re creating an improbable hypotheticals here.
4049,2020-06-18 15:50:36,hbbpwr,"Firing and completely missing, followed up by his execution. This video only goes to vindicate their murder charges."
4050,2020-06-18 15:11:14,hbbpwr,"Actually, if you shoot that person in the back, even if they “initiated” it, you’re going to jail. The simple act of them fleeing means you are no longer in a self-defense situation."
4051,2020-06-18 14:32:27,hbbpwr,Sure that’s what they state. and that’s why people are protesting for reform.
4052,2020-06-18 14:52:14,hbbpwr,I disagree
4053,2020-06-18 14:41:07,hbbpwr,"The taser had been discharged. How lethal is it once it has been used and the probes aren’t able to be effectively aimed and projected at anyone?

The fact that Brooks was not thinking of anyone else’s safety is not considered a justifiable reason for the police, who are legally obligated to care about their use of deadly force, to shoot him."
4054,2020-06-18 14:38:28,hbbpwr,"What else could Brooks do that endangered their lives at the exact moment they shot him?  The only situations where police are allowed to shoot someone is if their actions pose an immediate direct threat to others lives.  As Brooks did not have a lethal weapon on him whose lives were threatened by him running away?

Hypothetical situations that require multiple steps are not germane to the question as to whether the shooting was justified.  The only thing that will be considered is what actually happened in the moments leading to the shooting."
4055,2020-06-18 15:11:39,hbbpwr,"I think he means more that its harder to try and evaluate that in the moment at night with a drunk man who threw your partner on the ground, ripped something out of his holster and pointed it at you. The officer didnt have a freeze frame or like a neural AI to asses the situation 100% clearly or factually."
4056,2020-06-18 15:24:30,hbbpwr,Agreed.
4057,2020-06-18 15:01:54,hbbpwr,"So you've now moved the goalposts from ""they knew the taser was out of ammo"" to ""they should have known the taser was out of ammo"". Are you really faulting the officers,  who had just been assaulted,  for not accurately counting how many times the taser had been shot at them before returning fire? It was a split second decision."
4058,2020-06-18 13:58:00,hbbpwr,"And yet, you continue to provide no evidence of doing so. Good day to you."
4059,2020-06-18 14:43:32,hbbpwr,"Your logic is so messed up. 

So if he had a gun and was running away pointing the gun at the cop, probably about to fire it, is the shooting still unjustified?"
4060,2020-06-18 14:53:11,hbbpwr,Did they know that the taser possessed no threat? In the all the footage I could not see that taser being shot a first time. So whether it was or wasn’t who knows what the officer knew about it being charged. He fired his shots seconds after brooks fired the taser it was a split second decision... the right decision it’s called being one step ahead of the suspect

4065,2020-06-18 14:38:25,hbbpwr,So you’re suggesting the officers allow the defendant to escalate the situation past being assaulted? Do they have to be shot to shoot?

4067,2020-06-18 14:45:06,hbbpwr,"Even if you were to totally disregard the taser, the drunk driving is a huge factor. It would be disastrous If he were to flee in a vehicle and continue to run."
4068,2020-06-18 15:01:00,hbbpwr,"The only thing that will be considered... where? In court? That's wrong. The cop considered brooks a threat to his life,  and that's what the jury will be instructed to keep in mind.  
Hypothetical situations are absolutely relevant, Germaine Jackson ;). That's what crime prevention is based on and it speaks to the frame of mind of the officer when he decided to shoot"
4069,2020-06-18 15:11:51,hbbpwr,"I don’t believe that’s moving the goalposts, it’s the polices responsibility to understand a situation in full before they resort to deadly measures. 

That’s exactly where the problem lays, that they made a split second decision to shoot someone. The fact that they are shooting without being fully aware of the situation is the whole problem."
4070,2020-06-18 13:59:48,hbbpwr,"Ok, the officer claimed that he knew the taser had been fired twice and was no longer capable of a ranged attack. It posed ZERO threat at range. Brooks was 18' 3"" away when he was shot through the heart from behind. 

You need to know more?

YOU CAN'T EVEN *TASE* A FLEEING SUSPECT FROM BEHIND IN THAT DISTRICT IF THEY ARE FLEEING.

Read the section regarding justifiable use of force, particularly the 3rd bullet point.

4076,2020-06-18 14:51:32,hbbpwr,The officers knew he had no weapon besides the taser. And they knew the taser had been fired twice and had no more cartridges. At that point you give chase and subdue the suspect instead of shooting him in the back.
4077,2020-06-18 14:47:17,hbbpwr,"Do the police shoot drunk drivers where you live?  That isn’t the protocol anywhere last I heard.  Typically they arrest drunk drivers not kill them.

Brooks running away with no real lethal means on him meant they needed to chase him down not shoot him."
4078,2020-06-18 15:06:49,hbbpwr,The jury will hear other evidence that indicates what actually happened and to what extent a discharged taser would be considered lethal.

4083,2020-06-18 14:06:32,hbbpwr,Resisting arrest and assaulting an officer is not a death sentence. Dealing with him accordingly would have been arresting him and sending him to jail.

Also, you can’t immediately assume their intent was to kill him, as more than likely it was used as a means of stopping him from going any further. He didn’t die immediately and he was soon given medical attention, but died later."
4087,2020-06-18 15:51:41,hbbpwr,Isn’t the taser’s ability to subdue an officer a major issue also though?

4090,2020-06-18 14:27:55,hbbpwr,"Once he was running away they should have either chased him or let him go. They had his car and his information, it wouldn’t have taken long to find him. 

The officers knew the taser in his hand had no more charges left and was no longer posing any danger, so they can’t claim there was a fear for their lives. They actually put other people’s lives more at risk by shooting, a stray bullet hit an occupied car.  

I don’t understand this logic of shooting someone to stop them from running away from arrest. Shooting someone isn’t an appropriate way to stop someone. You should only shoot as a very last resort when lives are in danger. That was not the case here."
4091,2020-06-18 15:05:33,hbbpwr,"Uhhh gimme a while to find a source. Don’t remember the official source, but I live in/outside Atlanta. He has some money laundering issues(something financial at least) and sexual harassment, and up for re-election after not cinching the primary. So that’s why under GBI investigation

Cherry pick? For one, he said Brooks was entirely peaceful for 40 minutes. Ok, but at 40:01 he resisted and started a fight, so cherry picking the time range of the encounter. Using that logic, the officer was peaceful for 40 minutes too, so why charge him.  I don’t remember what else he said off the top of my head, but he was leaving out very key details.

The police are **not** allowed to shoot a suspect based on what he may do in the future. Shooting someone is a last resort when their life or bystanders lives are in direct physical danger. The 1985 Supreme Court case Tennessee v. garner says “The use of deadly force to prevent the escape of all felony suspects, whatever the circumstances, is constitutionally unreasonable.” 

All that aside, he wasn’t even holding a dangerous weapon once both shots were fired from it. It no longer posed a threat, so that whole point goes out the window anyway."

Justified, like the other shootings are ""justified.""

But it's not justice.

You can appeal to fear or anger - the police were afraid and the victim was violent - but that won't justify it.

Fear and anger are not written into the law as a loophole to escape due process.

Fear and anger will not replace a jury and a judge.

No, you cannot fire a non- lethal weapon at a police officer. That's criminal - and as justice applies to it, you deserve to be locked up for it. There is no serious question about this; virtually all of society condemns this violence.

The important question is: Are the police actions just? No. This was a miscarriage of justice. The actions of public servants are the only actions that must be justified in this discussion."

I am actually shocked that a cop was fired already.  Things seem to be pretty by-the-book and respectful.

&#x200B;

Folks can check my comment history.  I'm not one to carry water for the police.

I don't see how this can be construed as anything other than justified.  He assaulted the police, stole a weapon, run away, and then turn around to fire on the cop chasing him.  I know from the protests that these ""less lethal"" weapons are still, in fact, weapons capable of great damage and/or death. If it is wrong to use a taser on Rayshard, then it is also wrong for Rayshard to use it on the cops.

&#x200B;

He was shot in the back, but it was while he was twisted part way around so he could aim a taser at the cop.

&#x200B;

Folks: what would you have done in this situation? What should the police have done? Let someone escape on foot after turning violent? Inebriation is no excuse, and if it were then a whole host of crimes would be immediately excusable because someone wasn't in the right frame of mind.  Would the cop be excused for being inebriated when he shot Rayshard? Why not?

&#x200B;

This is nothing like the murder of [Walter Scott.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Walter_Scott)

&#x200B;

Edit: also, regardless of the events or who Rayshard was, it is good that Tyler Perry is paying for the funeral.  I've buried family.  It is horrible as-is, and if Rayshard is like most people his age, there was almost certainly no savings or planning for a funeral before he died.  Tyler Perry is showing great kindness."

 Apparently, APPARENTLY, a taser is so non-lethal that a drunk 40+ year old man who's already handcuffed can be threatened for struggling. At worst, he'd been able to run while his hands were cupped behind his back. 

But these cops shot a guy for grabbing a taser - the same type of weapon that, again, was used to threaten a drunk guy already handcuffed. 

Seems pretty fucked to me, but what do I know."

My question stands, criminal fights, steals taser, runs and fires it at the officers. 

How do you deal with that situation as a cop? 

WHITE OR BLACK , no one would get away with that justifiably.

You saying cop just doesn't shoot and let's him steal the weapon and run away?

How could he have RAN and tackled him that distance?? Are you guys real right now? Brooks had a weapon aimed at them??

That's the issue. 

Are there unjust white shootings?  Probably!  But as a white person, I'm given the benefit of the doubt nearly always.  I think another aspect to BLM is that the police need to be held more accountable in general for all uses of lethal force.

The police shoot more than 1,000 people every year. The overwhelming discrepancy is that black people make up only a 15% of the US population but are disproportionately shot by police."

No they aren’t. And doing half of them immediately puts your life at risk. Getting shot is the result of these actions."

I’m not saying Rayshard would have don’t more harm but you can’t have cops being tased and left vulnerable. Being a cop is a dangerous fucking job. If you pull a taser on a police officer or any weapon in that instance they should have the right to defend themselves. Also what if Rayshard pulled a gun from the cops hand what make you think he wouldn’t have pulled that trigger, he was doing anything in his power to not get arrested."
4181,2020-06-20 06:21:59,h9n1bo,He had a history of being a piece of shit he was on probation for 4 crimes and one of them  was cruelty to children and then he goes and gets hammered and passes out in a drive thru line the guy didn’t even know what city he was in when the cops questioned then he resisted arrest punches a cop in the face and he stole the taser out of the cop’s hand and goes running away and shoots the taser at the cop’s face. This guy had the chance to get out of prison early and to behave and still acts like a piece of shit he shouldn’t have been let out of prison he can’t function being a good human and contribute to society.

4184,2020-06-16 00:14:11,h9n1bo,"What do you mean he didn't go for the gun?

1. He's so drunk he was asleep at the wheel. He probably didn't even know if he had a taser or a gun.

2. He's already being tased to no effect. Hence his ability to run away

3. If he lands the taser on the cop, he's taking his gun. He's already assaulted 2 officers and stole one of their weapons. It's not so much a hypothetical as much as it is an assumption.

Running away isn't blanket protection from violence. You've assaulted 2 officers, stolen a weapon, and are actively using it against them. Once you fire a weapon at police, prepare for them to fire back. Tasers clearly have not and are not working to subdue him, guns are the next option."

> It’s the fact that people are making him a martyr and treating it the same as Floyd.

So, I've been listening a lot to *The Fifth Column*  and I'm trying not to make generalizations anymore as much as possible. I cant speak to how most ppl feel about this, I dont think you can either, respectfully. That said if I assume you're correct, I understand why that would be frustrating. They are not the same. I'm not sure how most people feel about it though, and I can't really comment on it. 


>What justification do you have for him fighting with the police? 

In this case none. I will say while maintaining my answer I dont know what caused this to escalate. 40 minutes without an arrest is a long time. Idk what happened during that entire time. 


> if you get caught you go to jail. You don’t fucking fight the police. You don’t take their weapon. Why is this a difficult concept?

I think this is the Crux of the point. We probably both agree that theres tiers of police encounters. So Breanna Taylor is the worst case scenario of course, floyd is another, castille is another, rice is another etc. Not all encounters are the same is what I'm saying of course. Let's do a hypothetical to answer your question. Heres the thing. I think most average Americans if you get them in a room alone would say yes, you dont fight the police or take their weapon that's not a difficult concept. 

But if you ask them, do they need to shoot him or pursue him the way they do, they would say no. Notice my word choice. I'm not saying ""what does the law require, what are the possible risks, etc."" I'm simply asking, in that moment, do they need to pursue him. I think the answer is no. Which beings us to the core issue here. All three men here acted poorly. The victim obviously didn't do what he was supposed to. But if you ask an average person, ""if a cop has a perpetrators car and home address, do they need to pursue him no matter what, and shoot him,"" I think the answer is no. 

Its incredibly complicated. I dont want people to read this and simplify it bc it is not simple. But in my view they dont need to chase him. Are they justified in doing so, yes, can they, yea. But do they need to? No. 

Which is what makes this difficult. Its not that anyone thinks he should fight them. I certainly dont. But then things change again when he gets up to run away. You can no longer say hes still the same level of a threat. 

>Would you be defending him if he drove drunk and killed someone?

And no. No I would not. But that's not what happened."
4192,2020-06-15 23:50:18,h9n1bo,"But he clearly didnt believe that. Is that what they told floyd when they arrested him? 

This is what happens when cops abuse their power. I don't know what the fuck people expect. If I were black and the cops wanted to arrest me right now I might feel like hey theres no guarantee I'm going home, I'm gunna take my chances."
4193,2020-06-15 22:11:16,h9n1bo,"Can you quote where I defended him? I literally just asked for a clarification. 

And a law can still be wrong and unethical."
4194,2020-06-15 22:23:39,h9n1bo,"Monster? Putting the public in danger? I hope you’re talking about the drunk driving he was doing earlier in regards to danger, and not one taser.

If so, I hope you feel strongly about scenarios where 3 or 4 cops tase one suspect.

It’s some untrained drunk guy trying to get away from the police with just a taser. He wasn’t going to start dropping people like flies, he was running and using a weapon he’s untrained with. Yeah it was stupid, but I feel like the cops could’ve handled this situation better.

All that training, backup, and a drunk dude steals your taser and escapes being detained?"
4195,2020-06-15 22:13:38,h9n1bo,"After looking at the video again there is a ""burst"" coming from the tazer when he points at the officer."
4196,2020-06-15 22:20:41,h9n1bo,"And up until now I hadn't seen the video. All I knew was he took the tazer, ran, and got shot."
4197,2020-06-20 06:34:03,h9n1bo,It was like a checklist of how to get shot by a cop he did everything to guarantee his death.
4198,2020-06-16 06:05:07,h9n1bo,The perpetrator was running away. At that point the cop was no longer in harm's way. Maybe it's not police procedure to let the criminal go and meet him at his house. That's why we're having a revolution that focuses on police reform.
4199,2020-06-15 23:48:51,h9n1bo,"Nope. try again. 

Cops are sober and trained. they had 40 minutes to fix this. You are expecting a drunk man to be coherent? Give me a fucking break dude. 

Cops should be held to the highest standard possible and under that standard they fell short v"
4200,2020-06-15 23:37:05,h9n1bo,"Yup, man has hands put on him, and he escalated. That’s the blackest dose of reality there. I appreciate the true colors."
4201,2020-06-16 02:51:34,h9n1bo,I think the problem here is not all that but the fact the a gun is needed to solve the issue. Despite all of that his life did not need to end there could have been many different ways to deescalate or even subdue the guy with non lethal means. The fact the the only answer the cops could find to the situation it shooting the guy. I don’t know about you my man but that is not how this should have ended regardless of what crimes the guy may have committed.
4202,2020-06-16 00:16:00,h9n1bo,">What do you mean he didn't go for the gun?

I meant that HE DIDN'T GO FOR THE GUN."
4203,2020-06-16 00:01:10,h9n1bo,"I've seen it. The penalty for being a scumbag is what, though? Death? Also you have nothing to say about the fact that you just justified his death based on a hypothetical which is clearly untrue."
4204,2020-06-16 00:28:42,h9n1bo,"So? If tasers are non lethal tools when wielded on innocent civilians, they aren't deadly weapons that legitimize lethal force. You can't have it both ways."

4206,2020-06-16 01:44:34,h9n1bo,Oh sorry. It's when Barbara down the street is hired to be leader of the bomb squad.
4207,2020-06-16 01:13:04,h9n1bo,"That wasn't the death sentence, attacking the officers resulted in the use of lethal force."
4208,2020-06-16 01:45:49,h9n1bo,"First off. Sorry if I came off as hostile. Events like this tend to wind everyone up. Especially when it’s in a highly charged media cycle like police brutality and racism. 

I’ve been arrested. Several times. Earlier in my life I had some pretty severe drug problems and I did a lot of things that I regret. That said. Every time I was arrested I complied. No matter how unjust you think laws are, or how garbage the system is, it is what it is. You work to change the laws you think are unjust, through the system. Despite how it might look through very selective videos and things posted on the internet, we have been steadily progressing and getting better all the time. But beyond that, with how reckless and dangerous drunk driving is, it should absolutely be something you go to jail for. Someone has to enforce these laws. And I don’t particularly like police. A lot of them have hard ons for power tripping. 

I don’t think there’s anyone that think the murder of George Floyd or Breonna Taylor was justified. Hell Fox News thinks it’s horrible, and they’re full on pro police and military. 

The problem in this case is. There’s a lot of body cam footage. It was a very cordial contact. The responding officer gave him several chances to pull over and sleep it off. He was literally gonna let him go and sleep it off. When the officer came to the conclusion he might be too drunk he called a DUI certified officer and had him proceed with sobriety checks. Which he failed. They then proceeded to try to arrest him. This is almost 40 minutes of cordial conversation, in which the officer was even offering condolences that his mother had died a year and a half ago. Once they tried to arrest him, he started fighting them, wrestled both to the ground. When one officer tried to use a taser, even giving warnings first, he fought more and eventually took the taser off the officer. He then began running, and the officer didn’t even pull his gun and fire until Brooks turned slightly and tried to fire the taser. 

Now I know it’s easy to look from the outside and say, “it’s a non lethal weapon” but the reality is, these guys knew nothing about who he is, he was calm the entire interaction until he wasn’t. Someone who changes their behavior like that is unpredictable. If you were in that situation with everything calm, then suddenly this type of chaos breaks out, can you seriously tell me you don’t know what his intentions are and fear for your life? I don’t know. I hate seeing people die. It’s sad. Tragic. I’m pretty much a sociopathic lizard person and I even teared up watching that fuckface kill George Floyd. But there are consequences to actions. Unless you want to live in a world of complete anarchy and chaos there has to be some law and order. I’m pretty much libertarian. Not the Republican who smokes pot kind, but a live and live type. But even I can recognize there has to be some order in the chaos. This guy made a series of bad decisions. It’s sad and tragic. But this isn’t a case of racist police brutality. It’s a case of a guy refusing to go to jail for something he was obviously guilty of and escalating the situation. 

Side note: I appreciate the calm dialog. Open to hear what your opinion is beyond this. It’s sad but I encourage you to watch a lot of the body cam video of the earlier interaction as well as the shooting itself. The context is important."
4209,2020-06-16 00:19:47,h9n1bo,"How many times to black people interact with police in a day? How many times are innocent black people injured/killed by police in a day? This fear of cops is exactly the same as a fear of flying. It's irrational. If fewer people were afraid of cops, fewer people would do some dumb shit around cops and get themselves hurt or killed. 

Cops should get to know the people they serve better and those people should get to know thekr cops better. This would serve to decrease this obnoxious fear people have of cops and allow people to be more respectful of the cops they do encounter.

It's awful that the guy died, but after you assault two cops, steal their weapon, and fire it at them, you've forfeit your right to be treated nicely."
4210,2020-06-16 00:03:51,h9n1bo,"Or maybe he was drunk, stupid, or both and didn’t want to go to jail. 

If you think that your chances of being killed by the cops for no reason are so high that it’s reasonable to violently resist, try to run, steal a cop’s weapon and try to fire it at him then you deserve what comes next."
4211,2020-06-15 22:13:42,h9n1bo,I don't think he was talking about you. He was just talking to you.
4212,2020-06-15 22:14:08,h9n1bo,"Can you quote where I said you defended him? Could you at least read the title of the article you're commenting on? Maybe even click the link and read some of the article? 

Could you try addressing the topic instead of deflecting? That makes it seems like your being dishonest in your participation here."
4213,2020-06-20 06:26:38,h9n1bo,He was running away after punching an officer in the face and other got his head slammed in the ground plus he stole their taser so yeah now this suspect it armed and dangerous and he wasn’t even from Atlanta he lives in SC. And do you really think that a criminal would go back to their home waiting for the cops to show up? They would be on the run evading being arrested.
4214,2020-06-16 00:08:58,h9n1bo,"So when a drunk man punches a cop in the face, steals his taser, and shoots his partner with it, it's fine. But if the cop fires at him that's not OK? That's one interesting standard you've got there I guess."
4215,2020-06-16 00:32:20,h9n1bo,Are you saying police shouldn’t arrest drunk drivers? Sounds like racism of low expectations to me. Every other race is expected to obey and comply with lawful arrests
4216,2020-06-16 00:24:29,h9n1bo,"That's a stupid comment. He stole a weapon from a police officer. That's it. It doesn't matter if it's ""only a taser"" He stole and used a weapon against an officer. It's that simple."
4217,2020-06-16 00:21:41,h9n1bo,"Hypothetical are what come up in a lot of Lethal force cases.

""He didn't shoot anyone but he pointed the gun at an innocent person so we took the shot to protect others from the clear risk of  injury or death.""

or

""We saw him reaching for the gun after being told to stop and felt that if he obtained a weapon it would become a significantly more dangerous situation for us and the people around us."""
4218,2020-06-16 04:43:31,h9n1bo,"They are less-lethal, actually.  A taser can kill you.  It was an extreme situation, and I don't think their response was unreasonable in the moment.  The officer who fired seems to have been trying to protect his partner.

The officers conducted themselves well throughout the arrest.  

It's tragic that a life was lost, but I think the vast majority of people will find this conduct within the acceptable scope of police behavior."

>First off. Sorry if I came off as hostile. Events like this tend to wind everyone up. Especially when it’s in a highly charged media cycle like police brutality and racism. 

No worries. I'm getting hit on the left for not being progressive enough and on the right for hating cops. Its whatever to me. I understand most ppl dont know him who they're talking to and are apprehensive.

Thank you for expressing personal experiences. That's a frightening thing on social media. I agree we have been making progress. Crime and cop shootings are down. That said I dont thinke that drunk driving is a jailable offense. Please dont freak out I will explain why. 

So I think most adults drink and drive. Almost every adult ive met has done it. If most people do a thing and the law bans that thing I think the law is incorrect not the people. Not that driving drunk is ok, its obviously not. But clearly most people will still do it. So then you have to deal with that (for example more public transport, more uber, etc) I think what he did was very normal. I've had to wake people up in a drive thru. 

>The problem in this case is. There’s a lot of body cam footage. It was a very cordial contact. The responding officer gave him several chances to pull over and sleep it off.

This is all fair. The question is, if someone refuses arrest. Do you escalate or de escalate? I'm not saying it's a rule or anything i know it isnt. If you look at my posts I'm not trashing these cops. I get the tough spot they're in. I think what realistic police reform people think is this is when a good cop says ""ok this guy is worried and arguing, what do we do."" It doesnt seem like they did that. They knew they had authority. I'm not arguing they're within their rights to try and use force to arrest him. I'm saying you gotta look down the path and see what could happen. 

Bro I'm a dad who has alcohol abuse issues. This has actually happened to me. They just brought me home. Just bring him home. I get it the law says you have to charge him but would anyone know if you didnt? No. Just bring him home. Just talk to him like a person. He clearly didnt trust them. Now kids have to live without their dad. And they wont care why. That's where I come from. Its not that he didn't fuck up. I agree he did. But damn fam, an execution? Did he really deserve that? The same dude who kisses his kids goodnight and has dreams deserves to be killed like this? That just doesnt make sense to me. I think a lot of people want to say either the cops or the perpetrator should pay a price. But I'm not like that. I want everyone to live. I dont think the cops were perfect, and neither was this dude  but man, hes dead. His daughters birthday was the next day. Did he deserve to die, no. Like all I'm saying is we have to get to a place where people arent getting killed. This could have been me. What would my son do without his father, in a country where he believes the cops are cruel? People need to think bigger. That's all I'm asking. Like we need cops to be our best citizens. This isnt the way. This guys daughter doesnt care about the dui. She cares that shell never see her dad again. That's her dad dying in that video. Its 100 percent unacceptable."

4234,2020-06-16 02:08:44,h9n1bo,Because he attacked and tried to incapacitate them?
4235,2020-06-16 02:49:37,h9n1bo,"Hey that’s totally fair. And I sympathize. I sympathize with all involved. And I’m not some police apologist. I’ve had my problems with drugs and alcohol too. I get it. I totally think there’s problems with police not being the best. There are plenty of crazy power hungry cops. I just don’t see it in this situation. 

Watching all the videos of this interaction I feel like the police did several times try to just let him go. The first interaction the cop literally knew he was probably drunk and asked him to just pull out of the drive thru and sleep it off. He didn’t. He passed right out again. When he woke him up again he had long conversation with him. 

I totally agree we should try to reduce the amount of people being killed. I feel horrible about anyone being killed. Life is all we really have. But the police were acting completely calm and cordial. Brooks not only resisted but fought two officers, grabbed their weapon and attempted to fire it at them. They tried using non lethal force and he fought them anyway. 

I feel bad that he’s dead. I can’t even imagine being killed for making a quick series of bad decisions. I feel horrible for his wife and kids that they have to go on without him. And over something so stupid. But as I said before, yeah maybe a lot of people do drink and drive. But some of them actually kill people too. People who are parents. Who have wives or husbands. And that’s a small decision that has major life altering effects too. 

When the cops took you home did you fight them first? Or did they just let you go? A lot of police have discretion over what they’re willing to enforce and it seems these officers were willing to let him off until they weren’t . It’s a tough situation all around but I feel like none of this had to happen. And judging by the way the video went down I’m willing to bet the cops involved are completely traumatized by the event. Watch the video of the first interaction. That cop was totally cool. I have no idea who he is but based off the interaction he seemed completely reasonable. I agree cops should deescalate but situations like this when it goes from zero to a hundred in two seconds, I don’t care who you are the adrenaline starts flowing, things get intense and if someone is unpredictable and willing to fight multiple people you don’t know what their intentions are. It’s not the same as Chauvin who just sat on Floyd’s neck while he was handcuffed and calmly killed him. 

Overall I just don’t think that as tragic as this is, it’s not nearly as similar as Floyd or Taylor which are absolute travesties of justice. 

And again I appreciate the dialog. There’s no reason you should be being attacked from the left or the right. Things are much more nuanced in life. And this alone is frustrating."
4236,2020-06-16 01:25:24,h9n1bo,"I am a proponent of police officers literally just hanging around in public spaces with normal people. It's real tough to hate a cop when you recognize that he's just some guy. Play basketball with kids, talk to people about how they're doing, be visible outside of doing cop things like arresting people. 

How would you suggest those cops have stopped him? What option did they have to arrest him? He beat them hand to hand, he was unaffected by the guy tasing him, clearly the only option left was a gun.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_policing



>Community policing, or community-oriented policing (COP), is a strategy of policing that focuses on building ties and working closely with members of the communities. The main idea is to allow police to feel like the public can trust them. A formal definition states:

>Community policing is a philosophy of full service personalized policing, where the same officer patrols and works in the same area on a permanent basis, from a decentralized place, working in a proactive partnership with citizens to identify and solve problems.

If you can't see how Brooks put himself in that situation and threatened the officers to the point of justifying lethal force, you're just looking for an excuse to prop this guy up or tear down any police.

This was a case where the cops did exactly what people want. They approached calmly, were respectful and when the crime was committed (DUI) they began to preform an arrest.

It was then that BROOKS became aggressive with them first and attacked them, punching them in the face and stealing a weapon, he attempted to flee and turned around and fired at the officers with a weapon, less than 2 seconds later they returned fire at him and he was killed.

The cops fire the taser and land it on him, but it's having no effect. The next step is firearms. 

Whether or not the next step *should* be firearms is a different discussion entirely. But in this situation, with current guidelines, the cops acted entirely correctly and the use of firearms ended in his death. That's bad.

Shooting a man who has just assaulted two police officers, when it's the only option to arrest him, is the correct decision. He is doing everything he can to not be arrested, and they are trying to arrest him. It's not first degree murder, you clearly have no idea what that means, and it *is* wrong. 

Killing people is wrong, but it is his fault that he is being shot at. He decided to drive drunk, he decided to resist arrest, he decided to steal a weapon, and he decided to fire it at officers. If he doesn't resist arrest, he goes to court. If he does, he could die. He chose to resist arrest and he died.

You shouldn't respect cops because they have the moral high ground, you should respect them because they're a human being just like you. When he acted civilly, they acted civilly. When he assaulted them, they stopped acting civilly."

""Freeze his assets"" lol this isn't a movie. A reasonable proposition, but not one I'd think of in a situation where my partner and I are being fired upon by a drunken lunatic.

""Heading him off at his place of residence"" makes sense but once again, he's currently attacking police officers. 

""The cops have numbers on their side plus more tasers than that guy has"" is just wrong. They have numbers, but two seconds ago he overpowered both of them simultaneously. He currently is holding one taser, the cops are currently holding one taser which is already in the guy and it's not doing anything.

I don't believe cops carry rubber bullets 24/7 but if a taser isn't stopping him, I doubt rubber bullets would. 

When you attack two police officers, you make the situation life and death. 

In Pennsylvania, one of the three states where third degree murder is actually defined legally, third degree murder is when someone kills someone else, but it was not planned or done while the other person was committing a felony.
 https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.seanloguelaw.com/amp/third-degree-murder.html 

This person did commit a felony by attacking the two police officers. Again, in Pennsylvania, aggravated assault is defined as:

Causing serious bodily injury to another and showing extreme indifference to human life

Causes, attempts to cause, or places the victim in fear of serious bodily injury and the victim is a police officer, firefighter, parole officer, sheriff, deputy sheriff, enforcement agent, or correctional officer performing their duties

Attempts to cause or intentionally and knowingly causes serious bodily harm to a member of the teaching community at a school while the victim is working at the school

Or uses tear or noxious gas or a stun gun to incapacitate any of the city or state officials listed in (2) above while they are performing their duties.

https://statelaws.findlaw.com/pennsylvania-law/pennsylvania-assault-laws.html

He was committing a felony and it is therefore not third degree murder either."

I think we agree on that and I'm glad to meet someone who whom I disagree but, to your point, doesn't resort to name calling and strawman arguments.

He will win most arguments because he is a good debater creating and asserting his own definitions and then bounces you when you use them differently or disagree. But him being a professional scout with originality, you'd expect a better track record.
  
Here are players OP had before Ja Morant last lear (post NCAA tournament big board): Zion (obviously), Barrett (OK I get this in a way and I think he will pop this year), Reddish (I was high on him too but over Ja?), Keldon Johnson, Daniel Gafford, KZ Okpala, Kevin Porter Jr and Romeo Langford. Over Ja Morant. If he were just a draft fan trying to have original takes then I'd commend him. But this dude is a professional scout.
  
 He has a few hits here or there (I remember he was high on Rui and MPJ being healthy), but misses like crazy mostly when he goes off the rails. His 2018 big board was deleted from his old website but the comments and his arguments against Trae Young or Luka Doncic to Sacramento over Bagley, show me a lot about how he evaluates talent. He wrote a whole article saying that what Ja is good at is learnable and what he isn't good at will hurt him since it's unlearnable and how other prospects will close the gaps. So yeah, I like reading OP and he's an interesting dude. There is a great chance he'll be right about a few of these (I'm very high on Meladon amd Maxey myself so I hope he is). But a grain of salt should be taken with the confidence he's displaying in his scouting methods."

I don't think that there is a starting PG in the entire league that possesses foot speed as slow as he does. People are saying that he's no different from Harden or D'Lo but comparing film you see a different story. Especially in regards to short area burst. Harden and D'Lo aren't fast per se. But they possess the ability to accelerate past in short bursts. You just never really see that with Killian. Furthermore, Harden and D'Lo both succeed because they are highly skilled. Harden is one of the most skilled scorers in the game. Maybe of all time. D'Lo is a standout shooter from deep and from mid. Killian isn't as skilled. I tend to believe he's gonna be a low to mid level starting PG at best and probably a solid game managing backup at worst (because he does possess the passing ability and is good in pnr). I'd consider him late lottery/mid first. Little bit higher than you, but not by much. Top 3 feels crazy to me."

Interesting that this is your criteria for #1. How do you feel about Grant Riller then? Outside of the obvious criticism that he's a 23 year old senior, I think he obviously meets this criteria

And the fact that you have Cole Anthony as the #2 PG despite *not* meeting this criteria (fails point #1). In addition, I understand your points about Killian Hayes, but I'd still have him above Anthony."

I also pretty agree with you on Hayes, when people evaluating him it seems they basically ignore a lot of his red flags with some over optimism they don't apply on others. 

Wanna ask question about Deni. I personally very high on him and think there is one swing skill that if he improve it he can be a star, and that swing skill is his ball handling. He's a high level passer for his size, has great size, more quick and mobile than gets credit for (has the potential to guard 2-4 positions), he can operate off the PnR like a guard, and has a guard skills on a power forward body, when the one skill that can help him put everything together is the ball handling. If he can tighten it to the point he can run an offense and create his own shots on consistent basis, I think his ceiling is super high (I buy his shooting because his form and touch both look reliable to me). Your thoughts on that?"

Then when describing someone else they don't like at the same position  ""\[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  can't shoot\]"".  Lamelo's shot, much like Hayes's, Hali's and Theos needs work.

4315,2020-06-15 19:49:25,h9mezz,"Why so low on Cassius Winston? Like I understand he's old and his archetype isn't the most valuable, but he has so many enticing abilities. He's an insane shooter and a better passer than all of the other small guards. Like the argument against players like that is usually that you can find someone better in free agency, but that just isn't true for Cassius (or Flynn for that matter, who might be a top 5 PnR guard in the draft). I think he can be a better backup PG right now than what probably close to half of the teams in the NBA currently have. And clearly that's not the only thing keeping you back, because you have Butler 26th despite him having worse shooting numbers and being clearly less of a playmaker. Is the issue exclusively on the defensive end?

Others I disagree with: Garza over Carey - neither are going to be good defenders but Carey has a more diverse and scalable scoring arsenal and you're severely underrating his passing. The passing numbers aren't good and he's not at all ambidextrous, but he's a willing passer who could become a sort of offensive hub under the right developmental contexts; Garza isn't an NBA player.

Dosunmu over Jokubaitis/Lee/Bolmaro - Dosunmu is a putrid decision-maker and doesn't have the upside that any of these other guys have. Lee and Bolmaro aren't shooters, but Lee is a better athlete and better defender, plus he's a more creative scorer, and Bolmaro is a tier 1 passer and on-ball defender in addition to his good ball handling and underrated change of direction ability. Jokubaitis is what people wish Dosunmu were; a decent sized guard who can create off the dribble, score and playmake with some decent shotmaking potential."

Edit: Also, just wanted to add that I 100% agree on Okoro and that I don´t see the Okoro hype at all. Okoro can´t shoot a lick, is an overrated defender (especially offball) and is especially an overrated passer/ball handler as you can see with his near even AST:TO ratio and late reads when passing, which is never a good sign for a none shooter and I just see MKG all over again. I also see a lot of Jaylen Brown/Jimmy Butler/Iggy/Winslow comps but I don´t see it personally. They were all WAY better mid range shooters who shot 3s/mid rangers at a higher volume and while Brown wasn´t more efficient from 3 and from the FT line, he was from the mid range and was a better 3 point shooter/FT shooter/mid range shooter in HS with more functional mechanics/fluidity on his jumpers. Not to mention, he doesn´t possess the passing/ball handling ability Butler/Iggy/Winslow did in college either, so I don´t see it.

Feel a similar way about Precious/Bolmaro/Oturu too btw but I´m not gonna go in on them since I am gonna leave that for when I post my big board. Overall though, I really like the big board a lot and like how high you are on Devin Vassell, Tyrese Maxey, James Wiseman, Cole Anthony, Tre Jones, Paul Reed, Tyler Bey, Desmond Bane, Aaron Nesmith, Xavier Tillman, and Killian Tillie as I have them all ranked similarly to you as well."

4326,2020-06-16 01:00:42,h9mezz,"This board is full of Hot takes, but this draft class will end up being very random so you got to respect someone going against the norm. Annoying to see so many public mocks having similar picks throughout the first round. 

Anyway, I disagree with a lot of these positions. Maledon at 1?? Not sure he's athletic enough to even ever be a starter, high-level burst you say, not sure about that, so many faster players in this class. I know he battled injuries this season, but he really did not make much progress as a prospect and that's why he has fallen down draft boards. I'm in the camp that Killian Hayes' game is much more suited for the NBA than Maledon's. 

The reasoning for 5, Aleksej Pokusevski is also very questionable. He will be much worse on defense than all of those players drafted before him with a similar standing reach because he's just way too skinny.  Defense for non-guards is key for young players to stay on the court and I just don't see him playing meaningful minutes for a while, if EVER. I don't have him in my top 30 and wouldn't take him in the first round if I was an NBA GM, his floor is extremely low. He's also a very poor finisher around the rim which is very concerning. People want him to be Jokic so bad, but he never will. Jokic was a force in the ABA and Aleksej shot 40% in the Greek B league and a shade under 10 ppg... 

Grant Riller at 45 (WITH LUKA GARZA AT 35!?!?!?!?). Looks like you haven't watched any tape on Riller and Garza will be lucky to get drafted if he even remains in the draft. Riller is the ideal backup Point Guard in the NBA can see him having a long career in the league, the guy is a walking bucket, could provide a team with secondary scoring.

4331,2020-06-15 22:01:08,h9mezz,"So basically with Garza, the reason he doesn't get much draft attention is by and large the low value on the ultra-big, right?

Basically with Garza, I think he's the most NBA likely of that archetype in a good while.  He tries on defense and is actually fairly good position-wise.  He shows some hope of being a capable shooter.  He's run NBA actions and isn't a strict post guy -- the Wieskamp/Garza PnR  was pretty unstoppable from what utilization it got not to mention DHO stuff.  He has an advanced enough understanding of passing angles to play those well.  And so on.  Basically Garza's an extremely skilled player fighting like heck against his body type, and at some point there's sufficient reason to think he has a better chance of winning than he guys behind him.

>Jahmius Ramsey

Ramsey just doesn't do anything.  He's probably not a completely garbage defender like some people think, but he's not good.  His handle is awkward because of how unnaturally low to the ground he keeps it, which means he doesn't lose it often but also doesn't get to the rim much.  He's not a terrible passer, but he's not good enough to justify.  So basically you're just left with this shooter who's kind of average at everything else and doesn't move without the ball well like the other high level shooting prospects.  That's not really worth much.

I talked about [Bey here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA_Draft/comments/h9mezz/my_201920_big_board/fuxocdf/)

>Precious Achiuwa

Achiuwa has basically 0 actual basketball skills but he's kind of athletic and tries really hard.  He's a terrible finisher at the rim, can't shoot, is only barely passable as a defender, can't pass, etc.  So you could theoretically use him as a small-ball 5 and just run people into submission, but Achiuwa has problems that keep him from actually fulfilling that role as a small ball 5 for any of the reasons NBA teams play smallball other than going fast, and going fast isn't actually as valuable as people tend to think.  I honestly feel much lower on Achiuwa than I actually ranked him, but everyone in that range has significant issues so at some point you just bet on someone figuring out a role best suited to his athleticism."
4332,2020-06-15 21:42:05,h9mezz,"The thing people don't realize is that compared to some stuff you see on individual actual scout boards, this really isn't particularly aggressive.  It's only in public scouting that people tend to think as narrowly as they do."
4333,2020-06-15 23:12:03,h9mezz,"So I already talked about a few points around this -- things like the shooting upside and the first step slashing/PnR are super valuable, especially when there's no clear weakness next to them because he's an above average passer/defender.  

But also, a few other less trait based arguments:  

He was regarded highly before the season, and almost the entirety of his fall was linked to a shoulder injury and being taken out of the limelight.

Being a productive player in the Euroleague at 17/18 is not exactly common, but he was.

Also I think he'll be the weakest #1 prospect since 2013, but someone has to actually be #1 and I think that he has both the best realistic upside in this class and a strong floor to go beside it."
4334,2020-06-15 19:43:42,h9mezz,"Well, here's what we know about Maxey from college:

We know he's 

* An elite finisher at and around the rim, both between his lay-up package and floater
* A highly effective point of attack defender, likely the best one in this class.
* A good but not elite rotational defender

Which on its own, yeah, would probably be a late lottery guy.  But Kentucky is the great limiting factor and guys get asked to be things they're not to fit a team.  Maxey is a primary ball handler, having posted the best AST:TOV of anyone relevant in last year's EYBL.  In college he virtually never got to run point at all because of Ashton Hagans.  So we have to consider what he was outside of Calipari.  And outside of Calipari, he was:

* An extremely effective decision-maker as a primary ball-handler
* The best shooter in the HS class.

And I may just be biasing again towards the lack of a clear weakness and over-biting on Kentucky's tendency to polarize their prospects, but basically it seems reasonable to be confident that even if Maxey is only a 36% shooter from the NBA 3, that he's still a valuable player relative to this class."
4335,2020-06-15 19:40:58,h9mezz,I'm not a Maxey fan in the slightest. Undersized 2 who doesn't shoot well and doesn't create for others very well. From what I've seen it looks like he just kind of puts his head down and tries to straight line his way to the rim most of the time. NBA teams are going to scout the shit out of that and he'll need to improve in other areas.
4336,2020-06-15 19:23:50,h9mezz,"Hampton is a good passer, but mostly he's not there for skill based reasons -- I think I might have him as the best draftable athlete in this class."
4337,2020-06-16 06:05:00,h9mezz,">But him being a professional scout

Someone should tell that to my actual employer, an insurance company.

>Here are players OP had before Ja Morant last lear (post NCAA tournament big board): Zion (obviously), Barrett (OK I get this in a way and I think he will pop this year), Reddish (I was high on him too but over Ja?), Keldon Johnson, Daniel Gafford, KZ Okpala, Kevin Porter Jr and Romeo Langford.

And here is what I wrote about that:  ""I consider players 3-9 here to be in a similar tier"".  Further, my assessment of what Morant is good at and what he is bad at turned out to be 95% correct.  What I didn't get correct is his shooting.  Which, as it turns out, is a highly variable skill that it's not actually clear Morant is good at rather than just riding a hot streak.

Not to mention ""He wrote a whole article saying that what Ja is good at is learnable and what he isn't good at will hurt him since it's unlearnable and how other prospects will close the gaps. "", which is literally a completely plausible explanation for what's currently going on.

Not to mention that literally several other major draft people had Ja that low.  Jackson Frank had him 6th on the first board I found.  Spencer Pearlman had him 6th.  Javier Pesquera had him 7th.

IDK I've been through this dumb argument too many times.  I pretty clearly outperformed 99% of boards last year including the actual NBA so I really don't feel like addressing it any further.

>I remember he was high on Rui

You remember wrong -- I had Rui in like the 70's (Edit:  On checking the board, I had him exactly 60), which is what a hit actually looks like there, since he's a bad player.

>His 2018 big board was deleted from his old website but the comments and his arguments against Trae Young 

Let's look at what I wrote about Trae Young!

>""Young was a significant negative individual defender, and is arguably the worst individual defender in this draft. He straight up had to be hidden against good opponents""

>Young was a great ISO Defender because he guarded bad offensive players exclusively when he bothered guarding anyone at all. He died on screens, was constantly lost, and there is absolutely zero argument for him as a competent defender if you watched how he got to those stats.

I think you're reading me speaking from the collective board that we did the mock based off of as my opinions on the class."
4338,2020-06-15 19:48:17,h9mezz,"I have Bey as a below average defender, below average handler (I don't think I've ever once seen him dribble with both hands in the same possession), and I have him a couple of tiers down as a shooter relative to the best in this class.

Expect Joe to be drafted in the 25-35 range, I suppose, but I don't have a great feel for that.  Houston doesn't have their 1st and they're the only team that I know really likes him so yeah."
4339,2020-06-15 21:33:59,h9mezz,">I suppose I never technically said to actually present an argument, and that's on me."
4340,2020-06-15 19:22:57,h9mezz,"Guys who are 6'7"" who can dribble, pass, shoot, and defend are extremely rare and extremely valuable.  The problem is that it's not clear how many of those Kalaitzakis can actually do (With a possible minimum of 0 of those things doable), but I generally tend to lean that the handling, passing, and defense are all real, which just means that if his shot, which has been inconsistent for a few years now, comes around, then he's a fairly rare player.  I think he compares favorably in terms of upside to Killian Hayes, but there's enough risk that a bit lower is reasonable."
4341,2020-06-15 19:33:57,h9mezz,"So my statistical philosophy around the draft is that I'm generally unwilling to accept most box score based aggregates (PER, WS, BPM).  They were tuned based on NBA numbers and don't work for the college game at all.

For component stats (i.e. things that describe a single thing), there's a few that I use.  AST:TO, FG% at the rim, etc.  Biggest thing here is that synergy stats are totally worthless and the ""threshold based"" methods that a lot of draft twitter uses really don't work either from a philosophical standpoint.  With shooting at large I tend to take a combined view -- if the mechanics don't back up the results, I don't buy in, but if the results don't back up the mechanics, I don't buy in either.

Realistically, I lean ""eye test"" overall, in the sense that college basketball's stats are woefully underdeveloped in comparison to the NBA's, so while I'm very much a stats guy for the NBA, I'm not so fond of what we currently have at the college level for use in scouting."
4342,2020-06-17 00:46:37,h9mezz,">Can you expand on Cole and his “anticipation” what about it seems so special to you?

So basically when you watch Cole, there's 4-5 plays a game where the point at which he starts moving in response to an action happens a good 2-3 steps before the action actually starts.  The typical example I give is beating the ball handler over a horns screen, which should legitimately be impossible (The entire point of Horns is that it gives you a wide array of choices so it's not supposed to be possible to play a defense that involves beating the offensive player to the point of the screen when you're not even supposed to be able to know which screen he's going to take), but also there's times on offense as well where he'll appear to figure out how the defense is going to react before the offensive action has even started.

Now, it's hard to separate this from potential noise, especially when he also makes so many bad decisions too, but it doesn't look like a coincidence.

>Why so low on Nate Hinton? Is it for athletic reasons? He seems like a good bet to be a rotation player to me.

Yeah, it's mostly athletic reasons -- I think he's short of the physical tools to be an impactful defender, even though the outlier rebounding anticipation seems to indicate that he might be able make up for some of his lackluster physical tools via out-thinking the opponent, but that hasn't clearly translated in college so I'm not sold on that happening at the NBA level.  Plus I'm not sure he's clearly better than replacement level guys like Treveon Graham who you can get with basically no resource investment.

>Would like to here more thoughts on Tillman, Can you see Tillman being a starter or closing playoff games?

I'm not sure Tillman starts -- a lot of coaches tend to start games big and then go smaller down the line and Tillman is pretty much small by default.  I suspect he'll have low end starter level impact, though, but there will also be matchups that he just can't really do much about because of his lack of size and leaping ability.  Basically, I think he could close playoff games given the right matchup, and honestly his positioning might be good enough that he's the best option regardless of the matchup and in spite of the size, but I think the most likely case is he's just outside of that range where I would say I'd outright expect them to be a consistent part of a team's closing lineup.

>Which player did you enjoy watching the most?

Sadly, Kessler Edwards didn't enter this year, because it would definitely be him.  Out of guys who were in this draft though, It's probably between Theo, Isaiah Joe, and Tyrell Terry.  Underrated pick is Jalen Crutcher, who was a nice contrast in enjoyability to Toppin, who I found unpleasant to watch.

>Which players are most dependent on what situation they land in?

It matters a lot for like 90% of this class because they have so many weaknesses, but I think Anthony Edwards is the most interesting name to talk about.  Going to a place that will reign him in until he can fix the lower body stuff on his pull-up could be huge for him."
4343,2020-06-15 20:34:48,h9mezz,"Ranking Cole that high is basically a matter of betting on the outlier anticipation, along with some actual basketball skill recovery from getting healthy/getting away from Roy Williams.

Deni is outlier good at being on the right spot on the court on both ends, and I tend to believe that that's the most valuable trait in basketball.  Basically everything else that he does is at a pretty average level, but basically good teams have their guys in the right places, so Deni has a lot of value to a good team.

Hali, are you higher on him or lower on him than me?

I do not buy PatWill's defense at all.  Like I don't think he can guard his own position, and I think his team defense has the Zion problem where a lot of the highlight plays are just fixing his own screw-ups.  We've talked a little about the muscle imbalance, but I don't tend to buy that that's having enough of an impact to get him to good in this regard.  The flashes are enough to rank him 29, though I have concerns about his ability to stick on the court without a clear day 1 skill, and I have him towards the bottom of a tier so I wouldn't object to taking him a little higher, but generally speaking it feels like he was given Vassell level freedom on defense without Vassell level instincts and I'm worried that that's who he actually is as a player."
4344,2020-06-16 21:27:24,h9mezz,I think he's pretty clearly better than Bender; Bender had major passivity issues.  If anything Poku has the opposite issue.
4345,2020-06-15 19:07:31,h9mezz,"Basically I think Dotson's outlier speed matters a lot.  While Jones is the better passer and defender (I also have some thoughts about the differences in how they shoot that don't really impact the ranking), I think Dotson's ability to just blitz people off the dribble, especially in the context of the PnR, matters a lot both from an upside standpoint and from a floor standpoint.  I also think Dotson generally makes better PnR reads, in spite of his passing being fairly normal.  Basically if they're both PnR heavy guards, I'm learning towards the guy who can warp the PnR best.  But yeah, the ordering of those 2 + LaMelo I could buy in virtually any order because they each have traits that let them warp the PnR in a different way."
4346,2020-06-15 19:20:24,h9mezz,">Interesting that this is your criteria for #1. How do you feel about Grant Riller then? Outside of the obvious criticism that he's a 23 year old senior, I think he obviously meets this criteria

I don't really buy Riller as half that much a shooter -- I think he's fairly average in that regard -- and I also think his passing and defense are both moderate weaknesses, even if they're not big negatives.  The other thing with Riller is that there's some mild and unfavorable anchoring bias to Jalen Brunson for me (i.e. when I watch him, in my head I just keep asking ""Isn't Jalen Brunson just the same player but better), which puts a cap on where I think I can consider Riller.  I ended up even a little lower than that cap, but generally speaking that reasoning ended the idea of him in the 1st for me because I think Brunson would be in the Okoro/Butler/Jones tier for me here.

>
And the fact that you have Cole Anthony as the #2 PG despite not meeting this criteria (fails point #1).

Anthony is almost entirely a bet on the completely nuts outlier anticipation he shows.  Being able to actually beat a man over the ball screen out of Horns is just completely insane logically.  I also don't think he's an outright bad shooter -- the degree of difficulty on his shots is fairly high so the percentages look bad -- and while he doesn't have great burst, that seemed to improve after the knee healed better."
4347,2020-06-15 19:09:27,h9mezz,I don’t think Grant Riller has two very important strengths and no weaknesses.
4348,2020-06-16 15:33:16,h9mezz,"I don't think with Deni that he needs to be a high level handler -- just enough to exploit his great knack for being in the right place.  Obviously becoming a high level handler isn't going to hurt, but if he's just the handler he is now, or just the post threat he is now, or just the shooter he is now, that's pretty valuable."
4349,2020-06-16 16:27:06,h9mezz,"I don't tend to think you can boil a prospect down to 1 or 2 things; There are almost no weaknesses so big that they eliminate a prospect entirely, and while you can have a single strength strong enough to make yourself a guy, you can't exactly go hunting for those because then you miss out on a large class of guys who don't have that."

I don't think that's true at all -- while some apparently more broken shots do get fixed, by and large I think it's definitely predictable which jumpers are fixable."
4351,2020-06-15 23:46:18,h9mezz,"> Lamelo's shot, much like Hayes's, Hali's and Theos needs work. They ALL need work.

I don't agree with grouping guys together like this. I think someone like Haliburton has an 'if it ain't broke don't fix it' kind of shot. It's a little funky, but it works. He's been an elite level shooter in college.

Lemelo on the other hand has a fundamentally broken jumpshot imo. His elbow is way out, he pushes with both hands and there's so many moving part that I don't think it can ever be a reliable shot. I think he needs to rebuild his mechanics from the ground up or he'll be a terrible shooter forever."
4352,2020-06-15 19:19:33,h9mezz,"6'8 PG with great passing vision. People buy into the potential with his size - that's it. Also Sam Vecenie is bullish on Melo and I trust Sam Vecenie's opinion.

>Having said that, if Ball reaches his ceiling, he has the most potential to be an absolute difference-maker. He’s the one with the most upside. He plays a critical position of value that is tough to find as a lead guard. Simply put, in terms of positional value, there is not a center worth taking at No. 1 overall in this draft. Due to how easy it is to find those players on the market, the only centers who should be taken at No. 1 are those who have a high likelihood of being All-NBA representatives.

Edit: Also I wanted to point out that Vecenie in his latest podcast episode with Rashad Phillips had his ceiling comp as a 6'8 Rajon Rondo. So really his draft position is based on how much you believe he can use his physical tools to develop as a defender, he doesn't need to be a great scorer to be a valuable NBA contributor"
4353,2020-06-15 19:24:35,h9mezz,"Lamelo can score, his handle is really good, passing ability is insane. He is Rondo/Rubio w/ less defensive effort and a lot more scoring ability."
4354,2020-06-15 20:02:48,h9mezz,"I think Winston's a much worse passer than you're letting on -- I'd actually have him well behind Butler (And all of the other small guards save for Pritchard) in that regard.  I think Butler's passing gets mistaken for a weakness when he's just not playing on ball as much.

I don't agree that Carey's scoring arsenal is more diverse and scalable.  We've seen Garza run DHO, pick and pop, etc. where the full list of NBA actions Carey has run is basically that Horns PNR that Duke ran the exact same way every time.

I may have overrated Dosunmu's shooting -- one of the keys in when I was thinking through ranking him was the combination of athleticism and shooting, but my value on his shooting may not have ever been updated from last year because he was still making some fairly high degree of difficulty stuff.  That entire tier of players was fairly mind numbing to sort out so I should probably, and will probably, move him down.  Though I do think Jokubaitis and Dosunmu don't really parallel particularly closely because the decision-making is so divergent."

With Ayo, I don't think it's actually clear what a ceiling version of him looks like, because he's kind of a lump of clay sort of player.  He can kind of shoot (maybe -- the mechanics are reasonable though the results were bad this year), his physical tools don't really restrict anything, he's an okay defender, kind of, he can kind of handle, kind of pass, and basically is okay at anything except for decision-making.  Part of the idea for ranking him as high as I did is that there's a very real chance to get him into your system and make him into what you want by actively prioritizing specific skills.  That said, I will probably move him down for submissions to any collaborative boards."

That said, I think he's the best defender in the non-Herb Jones class of this group, and I think his offensive value is entirely shooting based.  The floor is in his ability to C+S at a high level, and the ceiling is in the ability to pull-up around screens at a high level.  He's also a reasonable passer but basically I think he'll be a good enough shooter to carry some upside with his team defense."

But basically for the 3 that I think I'm actually low on in that area, the problem isn't the passing (Which I think it's important to distinguish from play-making, which I'm less convinced of for those 3 as much as a distinction exists), but that there's nothing beyond the passing.  

Like Poku's value to me isn't that he's a high level passer, though he is, but in that he's a high level passer who also take an unprecedented volume of 3's for his size.  Tillman's value to me is more in his impact as a defender that's in the right place on offense than his passing.  Perry's value to me is a combination of his ability to exploit mismatches.  And while all 3 are high level passers (sometimes), they have much bigger strengths to go alongside it that the 3 that I'm low on don't.

As for the others, I don't actually think that Maxey and Butler should qualify as non-playmakers just because they were played off ball more than most college PGs.  Anthony and Dotson are bets on outlier traits making up for their passing."
4361,2020-06-19 19:12:48,h9mezz,"To the edit:

Okoro's definitely an overrated defender, but I actually don't agree that his passing is overrated.  He's actually fairly high level there, to the point that I think it's outright better than his defense."
4362,2020-06-24 07:47:52,h9mezz,"So by and large, Edward is loved in prospecting circles for his shotmaking upside, right?  Basically people look at games like his 2nd half against Michigan St. or the game against SCar and go ""hey, he might be a guy who just explodes"".  

I don't see that at all.  I watched both games (among others) and to me he looked like the same player as ever, only the terrible shots he usually misses went in.  Until his tendency to flail his right leg wildly while pulling up going L-R goes away, he's not going to make those consistently.

But that's oversimplifying things.  While I don't buy the shotmaking upside, I do think he'll be a good shooter if he's not taking too many pull-ups.  I also think his passing vision is good for his role, but most crucially, I think his first step, when he actually uses it, is very good.  I think that gives him a very strong floor, even if I don't buy the upside as currently framed.

Atlanta is the dream situation for him.  Won't have to absorb excessive usage, but can still playmake off the dribble.  He'd possibly get some mild defensive cover as well given that Reddish looks extremely good there, but also so much energy is spent covering for Trae there that I wouldn't bank too hard on that.

Now, while Atlanta is the best option for Edwards, Edwards may not be the best option for Atlanta given that that undermines Huerter, who I very much believe in, but I think they'll figure out a way to make it work.  Maybe."
4363,2020-07-01 00:36:39,h9mezz,"He was disappointing in the sense that Florida should've been in contention for the national championship.  His individual play, however, was still very good.

Basically he's a high level passer at size with some well developed actions -- he's a very capable PnR player but also has a post game that utilizes his size advantage over other PGs -- and a good handler/defender.  His shot is reasonable mechanically such that the percentages will probably recover, and all of that adds up to a reasonable back-up."
4364,2020-07-01 15:03:44,h9mezz,"Think the biggest thing is just the much better height/length.  Like Reed has minor advantages as a passer/finisher, but mostly it's just that you can get away with a lot more stuff when you have about 4 inches combined of extra height + wingspan."
4365,2020-07-26 15:01:39,h9mezz,"FWIW I don't consider the gap in them too large, but basically Oturu just has a defensive mobility that Carey has no chance of matching, plus I trust him as a shooter over Carey.  They also have the same generalized weaknesses which doesn't hurt."
4366,2020-06-16 01:33:51,h9mezz,">Not sure he's athletic enough to even ever be a starter, high-level burst you say, not sure about that, so many faster players in this class

I mean he's not Dotson/Hampton but he doesn't have to be.  He consistently gets by guys, and for someone with his shooting/finishing that's more than enough.

> I know he battled injuries this season, but he really did not make much progress as a prospect and that's why he has fallen down draft boards

This is almost entirely untrue.  He's added the ability to relocate to find his 3 since last year.  He fell down draft boards because people think he's boring and don't understand competition differences between leagues.

> I'm in the camp that Killian Hayes' game is much more suited for the NBA than Maledon's.

That's not an argument.  That's a claim.

>He will be much worse on defense than all of those players drafted before him with a similar standing reach because he's just way too skinny

But he's already shown some excellent weakside rotations.  Are there guys that can overpower him?  Sure.  But he still projects as a good defender in the long run and potentially transformative offensively.

>People want him to be Jokic so bad, but he never will. Jokic was a force in the ABA 

You're arguing against something I never said nor do I believe because it's dumb.

> Aleksej shot 40% in the Greek B league and a shade under 10 ppg...

Right, and he also was aggressively pulling up for 3's, hitting passing reads most guards struggle to make at that age, and using his handle to full effect.  

>Grant Riller at 45 (WITH LUKA GARZA AT 35!?!?!?!?)

Yes, and?

>Looks like you haven't watched any tape on Riller

5 games over the last 2 years?

>Garza will be lucky to get drafted if he even remains in the draft

I can't be held responsible for the mistakes of the NBA front offices.

>Riller is the ideal backup Point Guard in the NBA can see him having a long career in the league,

Most backup PGs are both better passers and defenders than Riller.  Like Riller compares unfavorably to a guy like prospect Jalen Brunson, who is probably the 40th best PG in the league right now?  Despite having an extra 2 years of development and only being 6 months older than Riller.

>You also have players here that are no longer in the draft. Herbert Jones and Andrew Nembhard are returning to college...

Rule for inclusion on this was that the player had to appear on the initial early entry list if they weren't autoeligible so I didn't have to constantly track entry and exit over 6 months.  Technically I actually forgot Both Gach, who I would've had 71?"
4367,2020-06-15 19:16:41,h9mezz,"There's a non-zero chance he makes an all-rookie team despite being a significant negative player.  Shoot, Rui's about to make it this year as such and he's probably the closest current prospect to Toppin.  ROY is unlikely, but the class is bad so maybe in the right situation.  

But in the long run I don't consider it likely that he ends up a positive player in a high profile role, and his defense makes him ill-suited to be a 4th or 5th option."
4368,2020-06-15 22:24:33,h9mezz,"Well for one thing I don't view Maxey as a 2.

For another, Maxey and Powell don't really have much in common other than being undersized guys that aren't going to be heavy on-ball usage guys.

Now, I tend to buy that there's a real chance that a guy like Powell/Howard/Pritchard/Winston, none of whom do I have ranked, makes the league and catches a strong bench guard role for the next 8 years, but I don't like betting on those guys because they're extremely replaceable."
4369,2020-06-16 01:34:29,h9mezz,"He's more like 6'9"", and yeah, he's that good defensively."

4373,2020-06-15 20:02:57,h9mezz,All of his indicators aside from his 3P% this year indicate that he’ll at least be a capable shooter.  He was one of the better shooters in the class in HS and is a good FT shooter with great touch on floaters.
4374,2020-06-15 19:31:34,h9mezz,"When I watched him, I remembered that a lot of his passes he projected a second before actually making them instead of reading the defense. Yes, there were some nice reads, but he also had many moments off the PnR where he would kind of go through the motions and pop it back to the big instead of attacking the defensive big in the paint. I am also not sold by his finishing, especially his touch around the basket. What are your thoughts on those things?"
4375,2020-06-15 22:06:47,h9mezz,"I feel the same way about Hampton. Right now he's a raw chunk of clay. Aside from athleticism he isn't great at anything, but he's also not bad at anything other than defense. Right now he's just naive on defense which is consistent with his age group, but I see him benefiting a lot from NBA coaching and film sessions."
4376,2020-06-16 11:13:41,h9mezz,My bad. I was under the impression you were a professional writer and scout. If that's the case then I appreciate all the work you put in and for your original ideas which with some I agree and with many I don't
4377,2020-06-16 06:40:08,h9mezz,"Also let's talk about my actual track record.  Do you want to know the list of hits, where my ranking both diverged from consensus and was more accurate than consensus?  Because it looks pretty good.

* Culver
* Hunter
* Garland
* Kenny Wooten
* Dean Wade
* Terence Davis
* Tremont Waters
* Sekou Doumbouya
* Luka Samanic
* Carsen Edwards

* Daniel Gafford
* Keldon Johnson

* Langford

Misses:

* Ja Morant
* Lou King
* Tyler Herro
* Robert Franks
* Possibly KZ Okpala
* Darius Bazley

If every single one of the possible hits turns into a miss, I would still be 60% accurate, which is phenomenal in the draft.

4382,2020-06-17 01:42:01,h9mezz,"1) That is intriguing with Cole, but if he has such outlier anticipation ability why hasn't it translated to his playmaking? I get that UNC is a terrible situation but I also understand it wasn't a strength of his in HS either (i am not sure, I dont really watch HS tape)

2) I think the way Nate might be able to surpass a guy like Treveon is through his shooting ability. I think Nate is/will be a good shooter at the next level and I believe in him overcoming his physical deficits w his IQ and Motor.

3) Edwards is definitely intriguing about NBA fit. I agree that it might be better for him to start his pro career off in a less featured role. I could see Edwards grow defensively in such a role too to at least a good on-ball guy."
4383,2020-06-15 20:56:59,h9mezz,"I’m a good bit lower on Hali.

How much do you think Coles problems were system/context vs. lack of athleticism to create advantages?

And that’s fair with PatWill, but in general I tend to value flash defensive plays as indicators of instincts, and I do think he’s a pretty solid rotational defender for a guy his age, at least enough to be hopeful that he can develop that along with his physical issues.  Is there a specific team context that you think would be helpful for his development?"
4384,2020-06-17 00:18:28,h9mezz,Again not comparing them as prospect more comparing the high early expectations out of a pick like that I feel like him getting pick mid to late lottery would be better for him.
4385,2020-07-05 19:31:30,h9mezz,I'm high on Dotson for the same reasons as you. The ability to just blow by your man 1 v 1 is so valuable in today's game. It creates so much gravity. It also allows for fairly simple reads and passes so I don't think that he needs to be an exceptional passer. I like Kira for many of the same reasons. I was curious though... what do you think of Dotsons pull up off the bounce? Do you think that is something that he can improve? Because I think that's a key to how valuable he can be for a team.
4386,2020-06-15 20:05:30,h9mezz,"I don’t necessarily think Riller is a better prospect than Brunson bc of his lower feel and worse shooting, but I’d say his biggest advantage compared to Brunson is his burst and functional athleticism as a finisher.  There aren’t many guards I’ve scouted that can get to the rim as easily as Riller or finish in the variety of ways he can, regardless of competition level"
4387,2020-06-15 21:25:11,h9mezz,">I don't really buy Riller as half that much a shooter -- I think he's fairly average in that regard -- 

I guess this is what prompted my question - you ranked Maledon not by his shot now, but how fixable his shot can be along with how polished he is at scoring inside. Riller is probably THE most polished guard in college bball at getting to the rim this year and while his shot isn't that good, I think it can be fixed enough in the NBA to not be a weakness.

So if your criteria to rank high is a fixable shot along with elite finishing, it seems Riller should be ranked higher. That's not to say I think he's a better prospect than Maledon - he's not - at the end of the day we're comparing a 19 y/o vs a 23 y/o, I'm just poking holes in methodology.

>Anthony is almost entirely a bet on the completely nuts outlier anticipation he shows. Being able to actually beat a man over the ball screen out of Horns is just completely insane logically. I also don't think he's an outright bad shooter -- the degree of difficulty on his shots is fairly high so the percentages look bad -- and while he doesn't have great burst, that seemed to improve after the knee healed better.

Maybe, I just dont trust his scalability in running the PNR at an NBA level, especially with regards to his footwork"
4388,2020-06-15 19:18:49,h9mezz,"Did you edit in the ""no weaknesses"" part? I swear I missed that on first read through. I don't agree that he doesn't have weaknesses, he has been wildly inefficient and if you are going to knock Melo for having zero production at the rim, I don't see why that criticism shouldn't apply to Theo as well but whatever. 

What are your thoughts on Cole Anthony?"
4389,2020-06-16 20:58:50,h9mezz,"Agreed, well said. I just I think he can be more than a role player (a star) and to achieve that I assuming a better ball handling will improve the whole way he can express his strengths. Better ball handling would allow him to create for himself against any defender, be much less predictable, and would help him maximize his finishing and passing skills and taking full advantage of his size against smaller players. I pray to god the team drafts him will prioritize to strengthen his handling and on-ball skills. It can be a difference maker with his ceiling."
4390,2020-06-15 20:18:19,h9mezz,What traits make a jumper more fixable ?
4391,2020-06-15 19:25:57,h9mezz,Except he sucked at scoring in the NBL.

4393,2020-06-19 19:57:00,h9mezz,"Fair, and I wouldn´t say he´s a bad passer, I just don´t think he´s a well above average playmaker like many think he is, and he is more so a slightly above average playmaker. He tends to make the right read and seems to be an accurate passer who puts a lot of oomph (for lack of a better word) on his passes but the thing that worries me is the fact his passing is being compared to Winslow/Iggy/Butler when they are all well above average level passers for none PGs. 

Plus, while he tends to make the right read and is an accurate passer who puts a lot of oomph on his passes, I do think his reads tend to be an extra half a second later than they should and unless he learns to make quicker reads, he´ll never be an Iggy or even Winslow level passer imo, which many think he is."

For Carey I think he’s fine as a drop big physically speaking, mentally speaking is whole other issue lol.

So if a team could teach Carey to be an adequate drop big, he could be a rotation guy."
4398,2020-06-16 02:34:50,h9mezz,"Sorry, but what's untrue about the point I made regarding Maledon? He missed a month with a shoulder injury and he continues to foul at an absurdly high rate - 3 a game in just under 18 minutes per YIKES (in Euroleague i.e. best competition). You also only mentioned one area he's improved on. Poor defender, can't keep up with some players. Handle is still a work in progress. Doesn't attack the basket frequently. 

Yeah I'm aware the difference between a claim and argument just planting my claim for future reference, for when Hayes is better in the NBA. 

The Jokic point was me referencing is stock inflation, not a first round talent. ""aggressively shoots 3's"" so he was forcing bad shots, yes another knock on him. His passing is the only intrigue. 

Does Riller compare unfavourably to Brunson? Brunson is the better defender, but Riller is the more advanced scorer and has incredible shooting range. Also over 40% on catch and shoot 3's. I would kindly suggest watching 5 more games then. You will regret not having him in your top 30. 

Luka Garza can't defend a pick and roll. Good luck in the NBA. He's got some real slow feet."
4399,2020-06-15 19:22:22,h9mezz,"While the class is 'bad' I dont think its *that* bad at the PF position - I think the mid-tier PF area is pretty deep with Patrick Williams, Paul Reed, Jalen Smith, etc. I think one of those guys could very well be a diamond in the rough this year."
4400,2020-06-15 19:22:22,h9mezz,"You put him next to a guy like Myles Turner, and suddenly he will be good. Sabonis is a bad defender at both the 4 and 5, and is not a threat from 3 at all.

I generally lean that passivity for players on professional teams isn't too huge a deal, in large part because they're usually not in a strong leadership position in the locker room yet.  So not aggressively taking mismatches into bigs isn't too big a deal for me when those aren't necessarily always the winning matchup.

Don't think the touch around the basket is better than average, but with his level of athleticism it hopeful won't have to be better than average for the overall finishing results to come out good."

Practically though, I'm not sure if you threw me old RPM or PT-PM for the college level (Which are the two best aggregates to ever exist) that I'd use either of them for anything other than potential identification of candidates to watch.  That said I will definitely use it for propaganda as necessary.

Ultimately the problem is that mathematically when you build an aggregate, if you're building it in a way that keeps you in the 2010's, you're using techniques that aren't designed for large outliers.  And you can do some things to mitigate that mathematically, but generally speaking you want your stat to be the best at ranking guys who are large outliers for the dataset (Which draft prospects fundamentally are), and I'm not sure that's actually plausible to do with the techniques involved.  Or any techniques really -- Outliers are hard things to handle."
4410,2020-06-15 22:19:49,h9mezz,"Potentially, but the thing is taking as many 3's as he does, even if you're missing them, is a fairly good indicator.  The form is definitely bad, and among the worst 15-20 in the league for that matter.

I get that UNC is a terrible situation but I also understand it wasn't a strength of his in HS either (i am not sure, I dont really watch HS tape)

I think you do see it some in his playmaking, but also playmaking adds an extra variable because your teammates have to actually do what you're expecting so it makes sense that it's also relatively rarer.  But more often, I think you actually see it in the places where his playmaking fails.  A lot of the time this season, you would see him make a dribble move, get into a trap expecting his teammate to have relocated, and then find that his teammate had, in fact, not relocated, and turn it over.  But it's definitely not consistent and I definitely understand not buying into it hard enough to bother.

>2) I think the way Nate might be able to surpass a guy like Treveon is through his shooting ability. I think Nate is/will be a good shooter at the next level and I believe in him overcoming his physical deficits w his IQ and Motor.

Treveon was a good shooter until his shoulder injury, though I suppose if we're comparing Nate to current Treveon then it doesn't make sense to consider what Treveon used to be.

IDK my other thing with Nate is that his best and most unique skill (the long rebound tracking) is something that the value isn't clear but I'm leaning low because rebounding in general is a fairly low value skill.  So if that's what sets him apart from the other 3 and D 2 guards in that range, then I think I'd prefer to bet on Jalen Harris having already consistently run NBA shooter sets (Though Harris is a worse defender), or Green/Ramsey's athleticism.  Honestly though there's at least a few teams that should prefer Hinton over those guys."

Ah.  I'm not sure exactly why this is the case, but basically I think I place a higher value on linking players than most, though I also think it's too narrowly applied to Hali (Deni, for example, is also a linking player IMO).

>How much do you think Coles problems were system/context vs. lack of athleticism to create advantages?

65/35 probably?  The system and surrounding talent were pretty bad and injured, but also the burst was a definite but smaller problem.

>Is there a specific team context that you think would be helpful for his development?

I think he's one of the few guys who benefits heavily from going to a really truly terrible team, because it leaves 0 doubt as to whether or not he's going to get on the court.  I think if he goes to a team with any real expectations then he's going to have to develop while getting very little time, and I'm not sure he's well-suited to develop outside of active game reps."
4413,2020-07-05 19:42:02,h9mezz,"I think there's a real chance that Dotson gets to ""good enough that you can't just totally ignore him"" on that shot, which is really all he needs to take advantage of that speed."
4414,2020-06-15 21:33:19,h9mezz,">I guess this is what prompted my question - you ranked Maledon not by his shot now, but how fixable his shot can be along with how polished he is at scoring inside.

You're misunderstanding what I think of Maledon's shot.  I don't think it needs any fixing.  When I talk about the manipulability of his mechanics, I'm not saying that he can fix his mechanics, I'm saying he can adapt his mechanics to suit what he needs to get the shot off.  It's something Steph Curry and Damian Lillard are both very good at and it's a big part in having a big upside as a shooter.

>Maybe, I just dont trust his scalability in running the PNR at an NBA level, especially with regards to his footwork

I think a fair bit of this is about the total lack of spacing taking away all the easy reads, but yeah generally speaking there's definitely no way to argue there's no risk with Cole because he definitely does have flaws.  But there's few enough upside bets in this class that unique ways of thinking about the game like Cole/Avdija/Hali/LaMelo are worth thinking about."

4417,2020-06-15 20:23:52,h9mezz,"The two big things I'd have are that it's better to have relatively 1 big problem than multiple small ones, and that stuff that goes in line with the basket is usually more fixable than stuff that goes side to side or up/down."

I know a lot of it was cherry picking, but he scored 92 points when he was 16 years old.  Fun fact: Okungwu was on the court too.  Anybody who can score 92 in any game, has some scoring ability.   

I'm not saying he is a great scorer, just pointing out that he can score."

4420,2020-06-19 19:57:59,h9mezz,"I didn't scout Butler/Iggy in depth, but his passing is better than Winslow's was in college IMO.  I can kind of see what you're talking about with the reads but he makes such advanced reads that Winslow really didn't that I'd give him the edge."
4421,2020-06-24 08:13:32,h9mezz,"Well the Warriors in general are weird for any fits at all.

Like if you're picking for their current core, then I don't think he's a great fit because he makes you undersized at the 2/3 between him + Klay, and if Wiggins is actually a long term piece then that's a mess too.  Probably not the end of the world, might even be a better option for them than any of the other available options, but not as good as the Atlanta fit.

But if you're picking for their next core, after Curry/Klay/Draymond are no longer top 50 players (Which is rapidly approaching already being the case if it isn't already for 2/3) then there's 0 long term pieces there except Eric Paschall.  Jordan Poole was a reach when they picked him and then somehow still managed to be much worse than expected.  And Eric Paschall is not a guy who should be informing decision-making.  So basically his long term fit with the Warriors is just his long term fit on a blank slate, which is fine, but isn't going to be as good as a situation like Atlanta where the exact role he should want is available to him."

4424,2020-06-16 02:51:37,h9mezz,">Sorry, but what's untrue about the point I made regarding Maledon? 

You argued that he hadn't made progress.  He made clear progress.  Therefore your argument is false.  It's pretty straightforward.

>He missed a month with a shoulder injury and he continues to foul at an absurdly high rate - 3 a game in just under 18 minutes per YIKES (in Euroleague i.e. best competition).

You're actually arguing foul rate?  You do know that's virtually uncorrelated to defensive quality, right?  Not to mention his foul rate isn't particularly divergent from, say, Hayes despite the higher level of competition and the entire world separating them as defenders.

>Poor defender, can't keep up with some players

Except he's not, and that's not a thing.  Feel free to post film of it if you think it is, but I think you're mistaking him for Killian Hayes, who actually has that problem.

>Handle is still a work in progress. Doesn't attack the basket frequently.

Doing some quick math, based on the shot chart from the Stepien, 52/164, or 31.7% of his shots in the half-court came at the rim this year.  Since shots at the rim are less common in the half-court than in transition, his rim frequency is likely better than, or at least comparable to, Grant Riller's (34.9%)

>""aggressively shoots 3's"" so he was forcing bad shots, yes another knock on him.

I mean his mechanics are good and he's shown the ability at other levels to pull up from 3.  So no, that's not a knock on him just because on a tiny sample they didn't go in.

>Riller is the more advanced scorer and has incredible shooting range

This isn't really true at all; Brunson was a far better shooter over his college sample and actually finished better his last year in college at the rim than Riller did.

>Luka Garza can't defend a pick and roll. Good luck in the NBA. He's got some real slow feet.

I mean just drop him.  It's not like his feet are slower than Brook Lopez's and he's anchoring the best defense in the league.  You can get away with being slow (Which no one's denying he is) if you're big and patient, which Luka's actually fairly good at.

Can you tone back the rhetoric a little?  You're kind of being a dick."
4425,2020-06-15 19:25:47,h9mezz,"I don't think Jalen Smith, if he's interesting at all, is a PF.  He 100% has to play C or he's just a bad stretch 4.

But yeah, generally speaking those 3 (Williams/Reed/Toppin) and Perry/Jones/Okoro are all in a similarish on my board and all of them could be NBA players.  Toppin is the one that I think is most likely to get mistaken for a top 10 player in the class in the short run though, if that makes sense."
4426,2020-06-15 22:30:06,h9mezz,"Also, just to clarify, I just realized you were probably talking about PF in the context of the all-rookie teams, but those are positionless."

4428,2020-06-16 02:06:45,h9mezz,">Can you explain in more detail what you mean when you say Maledon has high level burst?

Basically he changes gears quickly and either gets by guys fully or gets them into enough of a disadvantageous position to take advantage of his excellent finishing.  I think the reason the general perception is that he doesn't have this skill is that unlike guys like Dotson/Hampton/Riller/Edwards (And also Kira Lewis), who are all comparable to him and admittedly, better overall at pure burst, Maledon often elects to burst by people and then use the advantage position to force the recovering defender to react.  Typically for Maledon it looks less like ""I'm going to take 4-5 steps and be at the basket"" and more like ""I'm going to take one really quick stride by you and then we'll start this offensive possession with you at a disadvantage"".  And I tend to think that that's more reliable at the NBA level where athletes typically don't just get completely blown by.

>Also, can you explain Maxey at 2?

4430,2020-06-15 20:53:14,h9mezz,I guess that’s understandable depending on how much you value his defense.  I think he’s really intriguing as a FVV type combo guard who’s really scalable on offense as a multi-level scorer and decision maker along with the POA defense
4431,2020-06-16 15:29:08,h9mezz,"So there was discussion of linking players above and how I generally think very highly of them, and Keldon Johnson as a prospect was a super strong bet to be an effective linking player because of his ability to score from 3 levels including off of mild movement, his above average passing for his position, and his defense, which wasn't elite but was at least good.

The other thing was the traditional Kentucky adjustment; he was pretty clearly getting less usage than he could handle, and was getting the ball in worse spots than most players, and he was still coming away impactful.  That + the pull-up shooting made me expect he had a higher upside than expected, which was the running criticism of him.  

Honestly I probably underestimated him as a finisher; I thought he would be good there, but he looks borderline elite.

But yeah, I realize not your gripe, but out of the Gafford/Okpala/KPJ/Keldon 4 that I keep getting crap for, if I had just moved Morant to the top of his tier then I'd be getting praised for how prescient that group looks because KPJ, Keldon, and Gafford have all looked good, even if it's been in limited time.  Okpala was injured, but can't really do much about that."

4435,2020-06-19 20:33:52,h9mezz,"Gotchu, so basically you’re betting that he speeds up his ability to make reads since he’s still rather raw and since the passing accuracy/ability to make the right reads/ability to put oomph on his passes are already there? Because my only question to that is do you think it’s possible to teach a prospect how to make quicker reads because I’ve seen a lot of scouts say you can’t teach playmaking but when he already has 3 of the 4 most important attributes to playmaking, do you think teaching him how to speed up his reads are possible, because if he does that I agree with what you’re saying, his passing is probably the best part of his game outside his ability to finish, but if you doubt it I gotta say I disagree with him being a better playmaker than Winslow since Winslow does have the ability to make quick reads, just not the passing accuracy Okoro has."

I can definitely recognize this argument, I guess I just find him more attractive of an option than you do. All the advanced college stats have him as producing at the highest level and I think that speaks for something. I don't see what in his game isn't scalable to the NBA even if its more as a 5 than a 4.

But I think the jumper is the riskiest part of his projection (like it was with Morant last year), and that there's a very real chance that I'm lower than I should've been because he's successful (for certain definitions of successful) from 3."

I do think it's worth noting that Vassell can't really do what Klay does defensively, even though I think he projects to be better than him.  Klay is at his best as an on ball positional defender.  That's not really Vassell's strong suit.  I think he'd actually more lighten Draymond's role than anything, which also matters."
4446,2020-06-16 05:18:46,h9mezz,"Just because they happen to have a valuable stat on hand doesn't make their analysis right.

I've already talked fairly extensively about Spencer being wrong on an unrelated Maledon thing [here](https://twitter.com/SKPearlman/status/1269035637082148865), and that entire scouting report was full of stuff that's just patently untrue.

And I'm aware that you were talking about Riller v. Brunson, but Riller is also relevant to Maledon because you clearly think he's good at something that you also think Maledon's bad at, yet Maledon's his equal in that regard."

I don't buy that stretch ability, mostly.  He's been a good shooter for approximately 10 games out of his career, and a bad one for the other 50.

This is the far bigger thing though; He has good length so he could theoretically be a good defender one day, but he's currently an abysmal one with little understanding of where he's supposed to be on the court."

4455,2020-06-15 23:50:38,h9mezz,"Don't agree at all that the passing has anything to do with LaMelo's struggles in finishing; He has 0 ability to deal with contact at all and consistently takes himself out of balance to avoid it.

And it's a very different NBA than it used to be.  Even the worst offensive players are still capable of attacking a defender as bad as LaMelo is.  And they might not run plays for that guy more than 10 times a game, sure, but that's 10 plays a game where you're giving up some pretty efficient offense even before you account for the level at which guys basically don't get to guard just one match-up anymore.

And yeah a big part of my concern with the shooting is that side to side motions are the hardest to fix, and LaMelo's shot has them both in the jump and in the bring-up.  The number of issues is relatively small in number, but I think his shot is harder to fix than just tweaks."

That's not what ICE is, though it does happen in ICE.  The technical term for that is zone up, and it happens in several defenses, including ICE, drop, and mush.

But zone up based defenses are by far the most common PnR coverages in the league, so if he can't beat those, what do you think he does?

And not only that, but what does he do against non-zone up based defenses?  He can probably hit reads against shows fairly well, but almost everyone can switch onto him for his lack of burst.

I don't actually buy that he can finish at the rim against smaller defenders too -- It doesn't show up in his film that I've seen.

As for the side to side motion, he shoots from his left hip.  That creates side to side motion on its own.  Additionally, he turns through his lower body -- look at where his right foot lands relative to take-off -- which can be part of a good form, but since he has it in conjunction with side to side motion in his upper body, it's a problem as well.  This has been reduced since HS but mostly that's because he reduced the jump at large so he's getting less power from his legs (Which is a separate, but more fixable, problem)."

4508,2020-06-28 22:16:47,hhjdxp,"Can ya start naming ""these men"" or include some sources, because I don't know what the hell ya are talking about.  

I go to comedy shows all the time and I especially go out to support black men and women comedians when they come thru.  There's never been an instance where it's just me and the comedian because no one else thinks she's funny.  

Men dressing up like women and doing COMEDY is funny.  Some of it is so stupid you laugh (Wayan bro.) and some of it is just fucking gold (Eddie Murphy).  None of it is mocking women.  A case could be made for White Chicks but I see it as  more ""these dudes are stupid"" rather than ""women are stupid"". 

We all know the hard road women go thru, especially black women to get a platform and show off their talent but putting men down to lift your self up is not the way to get ahead or bring attention to the issue.  

You talk about ""looking at Tyler Perry"" but he's out there giving a platform and putting his money down so black men and women can show off their talent and get something on their acting resume other than street thug, Aunt Jemima and Morgan Freeman."

4526,2020-06-29 19:54:03,hhjdxp,">If you wanted to have a discussion, discounting everything i said and labeling it as ancedotal aint really the way. Cause everything youve said besides the link you posted falls into the same category. The link you posted also comes with some pretty heavy bias and some statements that are flat out not true. Such as the statement that men make more [sex jokes and use more crude humour](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/gpqyv5/oc_differences_between_men_and_women_standup/). The gist of it I would agree with though (aside from the incredibly heavy-handed blaming men approach). Men have more universal appeal, gay or straight. If this was based on the patriarchy we wouldnt see as many gay comics breaking out but we do and they are also pretty danm funny. Its facts and has nothing to do with women suffering backlash for daring to get on stage and cracking a few jokes. Simply put men gotta be funny to get laid, we got the easy way out. Ive seen some pretty ugly dudes take home some dime pieces cause theyre funny. Ive always said women are far less shallow then men are. No matter how many times a girl makes a guy laugh if she aint fine then we just friends, Sad but true. Well this went off sideways but the point is women have it bad enough, you dont really need to invent more reasons to be victims when women are already victimized on a daily basis. I aint that pretty, you aint that funny. Not everything has to be a tragedy.

I knew this is where this conversation was headed, but I wanted to give you the benefit of the doubt...

That was a waste.

Beyond the pearl clutching, this is a very hollow retort. It's says nothing, and does even less.

It's either a very sad ""men are the real victims, having to be real funny"", or ""women just don't get funny hur durr""

The point is, you missed the point."

This is seen when she won’t let the boys copy her HW (most of the time), and when Hermione is mad when she thinks Harry put felix felicis into Ron’s drink for quidditch tryouts, etc..

4561,2020-06-28 23:13:27,hhj0td,"""Through denying their feelings of fear to one extent or another, Sexual Sixes go against danger from a position of strength; therefore, they have a passion for searching for or securing a position of strength. And it's not just a strong character they seek, but the kind of strength that makes somebody else afraid-they want to assume a powerful enough to hold the enemy at a distance. These Sixes display a forcefulness that comes from no wanting to be weak, and they don't allow for weakness in themselves....""

"".....Sexual Sixes have a need not just for strength but for intimidation. As Naranjo suggests, this expression of intimidation is very much the essence of the character; if they appear strong, they won't be attacked. ....""

"".....Sexual Sixes give off the impression that they could get violent with anybody at any time, but that doesn’t mean that they have no fear. It is precisely out of a sense of fear that their anticipation of an attack comes-there is a somewhat paranoid imagining of danger, a belief that anyone can turn into a threat. However, these Sixes usually do not look afraid; their visible character could hardly be called ""fearful"" from the outside.

In contrast to the Self-Preservation Six, who backs away from threats, the couterphobic Sexual Six tends to move toward risky situations, feeling a sense of safety in actually confronting danger rather than hiding from it or avoiding it. They convince themselves (and others) that they are not victims of fear; they are convinced that fear is an emotion that should be eliminated systemically.....""

"".....The fact that these Sixes regularly move against danger (or perceived danger) can, at times, give them the appearance of a rebel, a daredevil, a risk taker, an adrenaline junkie, or a troublemaker. In some cases, Sexual Sixes may be prone to megalomania or having a ""hero complex."" In their own way, they seek to be ""good guys"" to avoid being punished. They may have the illusion that they are spontaneous, but they tend not to be.

Sexual Sixes tend to be very contrarian: they always have an argument at hand to refute and contradict an opinion. Instead of thinking in terms of ""best-case"" or ""worst-case"" scenarios, they think in terms of contrarian scenarios-if the trend is for others to focus on the worst, they will focus on the best; but if everyone is focusing on the best, they will assert the worst.....""

She also used the time turner to take more classes, which to me screams 3. She also breaks the rules a lot. i know it’s for the greater good a lot, but she breaks so many rules that a 1 would have a heart attack. That’s why I think she’s a 3 and not a 1.

Will Hunting is a counterphobic 6, you can see the difference between the two. Everything Will does is fear based, even when he gets unruly and abrasive. He fears getting hurt (his trauma definitely plays into that, and there's nothing to suggest that enneagram type isn't born from trauma)."

4710,2020-08-18 19:42:37,ic7opn,I feel like I'm missing something with Precious Achiuwa. He seems really high on here from what I have seen. Anyone have a good overview of why he's valued so highly?
4711,2020-08-18 20:20:09,ic7opn,"Toppin would be an awful pick for us. 

He doesn't solve any of our current needs. But I wonder if he would make strides defensively under someone like Thibodeau."
4712,2020-08-18 20:25:46,ic7opn,Pat Williams is the exact type of player I expect the Kings to pick with Vassell on the board
4713,2020-08-18 19:52:09,ic7opn,Hmm would the Knicks draft Obi Toppin tho? We need pgs/floorspacing right?
4714,2020-08-18 19:48:59,ic7opn,Tillman at 40 is crazy to me
4715,2020-08-18 20:10:53,ic7opn,I don’t know what these guys were smoking but there’s just no way some of these teams pick the players they have going to them.   It’s like they wanted to ignore team needs or fit completely to validate their prospect rankings.
4716,2020-08-18 20:09:38,ic7opn,"Celtics   
\#14 RJ Hampton & #47 Yam Madar  
I Love this combination. 

But I don't know #30 Udokq Azubike whether suitability coach Brad Stevens ?"
4717,2020-08-18 20:11:44,ic7opn,I’ll wet myself if we come away with Hayes
4718,2020-08-18 20:52:31,ic7opn,"Rj over cole , Maxey and kira...... I must have watched the wrong rj for the last year then."
4719,2020-08-18 20:12:55,ic7opn,"As a Suns fan, if they get in a position where they stick at 10 and both Haliburton and Hayes are still there at 9 and pretty much guaranteed to be able to pick at least one of the two, i'd take that any day of the week."
4720,2020-08-18 21:57:21,ic7opn,"Puke-worthy draft for the Sixers. We could pick so many different players at 21 that would give us more value than Nico.

Then we proceed to draft Tre Jones at 36??? What the fuck? Why? If you already gave us a facilitating PG that shoots a shitty clip from 3 in Nico, why give us another mediocre shooter in Tre instead of a Desmond Bane or Tyrell Terry?

Fuck this draft for the Sixers. I’m not even knocking the Oturu pick either, but I’d be heated if our best pick in the draft was a fucking center."
4721,2020-08-18 23:01:59,ic7opn,"If the Spurs take Nesmith at 11 over Williams, Vassell, and Maxey I will quite literally weep."
4722,2020-08-18 19:48:05,ic7opn,"Celtics are getting one of my biggest sleepers in this draft at #47.   
What an awesome pick that could have been.   
Love the pairing of Poku and the Nuggets.   
Achiuwa at 8? wow, that's high."
4723,2020-08-18 22:00:03,ic7opn,I don't see Cleveland taking Wiseman now since Andre Drummond is staying.
4724,2020-08-18 20:47:45,ic7opn,The Pelicans are winning the championship if they get Vassell at 13
4725,2020-08-18 20:59:46,ic7opn,Hornets drafting Precious after PJ makes no sense. I’d rather draft Killian Hayes lmao.
4726,2020-08-18 21:15:55,ic7opn,Big fan of the wolves first round. About as good as it could get for them. Woulda gone with another PG like Malachi or someone to contribute like Tillman in the second
4727,2020-08-19 02:13:18,ic7opn,"Damn, seems pretty low for Vassell"
4728,2020-08-19 06:03:12,ic7opn,Nico Mannion in the first round? I dont think the author knows what he's doing.
4729,2020-08-18 19:33:51,ic7opn,"One pick after Kira, and we picked Nico 😔



Edit: What tf draft was this for the Sixers? Why would we pick Tre over Riller? Oturu makes no sense. Big fan of Reggie Perry but don't think he fits. Would've picked Paul Reed over both these guys."
4730,2020-08-18 22:36:38,ic7opn,"Absolutely no chance the Hornets leave Hali/Hayes/Vassell on the board and take Precious. That’s not good a take.

And Carey Jr. with our second leaving sooo many better players in the board. This is just bad."
4731,2020-08-18 20:01:25,ic7opn,"Tyler bey would be great on the lakers

Feel like josh green is went a little too low

Also Isaiah joe at 46 as well"
4732,2020-08-18 20:31:23,ic7opn,"Any overview on Jalen Smith?

Seems like he will be behind Claxton and another starter for the 4.

I do like KMart Jr in 2nd round, if only for nostalgic reason. I drafted him for the Nets on 2K as well :D"
4733,2020-08-18 21:43:11,ic7opn,"Terry and Bane seem super low 

Starting to feel crazy having Saddiq Bey at 7..."
4734,2020-08-18 21:54:55,ic7opn,"Ramsey is the type of player the mavs need. He’s a great defender (top 5 in the draft in my opinion). He can shoot the 3 very well. He is very athletic. He can also play on and off the ball. The thing he lacks is aggressiveness, which the mavs players can help him with."
4735,2020-08-18 22:04:20,ic7opn,if Poku goes to the Nuggets it’s over
4736,2020-08-18 23:17:04,ic7opn,"I'd be so stoked if the Spurs got both Nesmith and Bane.  We could definitely use a big, but that'd be an excellent outcome."
4737,2020-08-18 23:19:34,ic7opn,High upside but bigtime project player like Poku makes a lot of sense for the N-words.
4738,2020-08-19 01:13:01,ic7opn,LFG
4739,2020-08-19 01:47:34,ic7opn,As long as Vassell or Nesmith doesn't fall to the Celtics. I will happily give them that pick
4740,2020-08-19 02:23:23,ic7opn,"That doesn't look right from the wiz

We need a 3 or 5...not a backup pg lol"
4741,2020-08-19 03:06:49,ic7opn,I’m surprised Naji Marshall wasn’t in the late 2nd round. He’s a guy who should be getting more buzz
4742,2020-08-19 06:03:13,ic7opn,Why would the Bulls draft Okoro over Vassell?
4743,2020-08-19 08:29:55,ic7opn,"If we can come away with Jaden McDaniels I would be stoked. 

We need to go for highest upside possible and he seems to be it in that 20 - 30 range. Will be interesting to know if his attitude issues are raised as Thunder are a high character organisation usually."
4744,2020-08-19 09:05:00,ic7opn,"If the Spurs pass on Vessell  I’m going to be sad mad. 

If we took Nesmith instead that would mitigate but still"
4745,2020-08-19 09:58:15,ic7opn,"wow this is bad ... so bad

first of all ESPN somehow still thinks Wiseman is a top pick but thats debatable at least 

Pistons picking a small ball big lmao this gotta be a joke the only two building blocks they have are a PF and C, they will absolutely pick a guard
(same should apply for the Hornets)

Mavs picking Maledon??? the Mavs have Luka, Brunson as ball handlers and even Curry can do that there is no chance on earth they are picking Maledon, they need off ball players and defenders (3&D)

Sixers picking Mannion, i think even the Sixers management realized by now they desperately need shot creators but this one is at least also debatable but not in combination with picking Tre Jones at 36 that really makes no sense thats the worst pick I have ever seen in a mock draft 

there are other very questionable picks but these ones really stand out since they are just mind boogling dumb"
4746,2020-08-19 10:35:05,ic7opn,I love Kira Lewis but Herro seems doing pretty good at PG lately rather us get Jaden Mcdaniels.
4747,2020-08-19 11:53:53,ic7opn,If we draft Okongwu I’m retiring from being a pistons fan🤦🏾‍♂️
4748,2020-08-19 16:33:32,ic7opn,"Don’t like knicks taking Toppin but they probably won’t since there’s almost no chance they get the 6th pick. 

Also happy to see azubuike rise to 30, I like him for the Celtics or Raptors"
4749,2020-08-19 18:50:19,ic7opn,Thanks for posting. It’s so ridiculous in this day and age you have to pay for a service to take a look at a mock draft :old man yells at cloud:
4750,2020-08-19 19:42:22,ic7opn,Anyone know why Jordan Nwora is so low? His numbers look good to me but I admit haven’t seen much of his games
4751,2020-08-19 20:58:38,ic7opn,Holy crap Knicks take Obi over Okoro? It’s like Mills never left!
4752,2020-08-19 21:15:21,ic7opn,No Myles Powell?
4753,2020-08-20 01:06:00,ic7opn,"If Hayes and Haliburton are available for the Knicks, no way they grab Toppin."
4754,2020-08-18 19:41:27,ic7opn,"Don’t like Cassius Winston pick for the raps there, there’s like 6 other players I’d rather have after him"
4755,2020-08-18 19:28:18,ic7opn,Mavs picking Theo over Josh Green or Kira.. booooo
4756,2020-08-18 21:22:49,ic7opn,Garbage
4757,2020-08-18 21:34:48,ic7opn,This draft is so bad
4758,2020-08-18 20:41:55,ic7opn,"Idk what scouts are saying about him but I think he’s undervalued on this sub. He can feasibly play all 3 frontcourt positions in time, you can’t question his motor or physicality, and he can potentially be a scheme changer at the 5 if he can get his jumper right. Reminds me of a Jerami Grant that’s a little bigger and more rugged on the interior. 

Has the length, bounce and strength to protect the rim, but is mobile enough to guard the perimeter. Can hold it down on the boards, and also push in transition (tho he certainly needs to work on his passing). 

I don’t really like the fit with the Hornets but I’m fine with saying he’s a top ten or so talent"
4759,2020-08-18 20:08:31,ic7opn,"I like Achiuwa, he's got the makings for a solid role player that compliments pretty much any style if he cleans up the rougher areas of his game, but that's it, I don't think Top 10 makes much sense at all."
4760,2020-08-18 19:46:54,ic7opn,"That and the Cassius pick were definitely the most weird for me. I really don’t know about Precious I guess there is a lot of defensive upside, but him next to bridges is a really weird fit and it’s hard for me to see him being successful without having a really small offensive role. I think it’s a lot of projection and considering the recent overdrafting of guys who have projected defensive upside like, Jaxson Hayes, Zhaire Smith, Bamba and more. I definitely don’t get it and  was so turned off by his terrible offense that I don’t even have a first round grade on him."
4761,2020-08-19 03:44:53,ic7opn,With the dearth of talent on the Knicks the FO can’t afford to pick on fit or need they need to go BPA. That being said I’m not high on Toppin in general.
4762,2020-08-19 21:49:21,ic7opn,Don’t see how a proven scorer is a bad pick. Yes we need a PG badly but there’s only a couple in this draft worth taking. We need everything. Especially shooting obi at least gives us better spacing
4763,2020-08-18 19:54:51,ic7opn,"The fit is weird there next to Mitch, but Toppin is not a terrible shooter and will probably shoot threes pretty soon. I agree, but there’s a lot of rumors on the Knicks wanting to wait for Cade and next years class. Even then I wouldn’t take Toppin, but that’s some rationale. The defense would be so bad in the short term though"
4764,2020-08-18 22:34:31,ic7opn,"I say this to anyone, especially the bad teams, you guys need BPA. Doesn’t matter position or skill set. Whoever is the best player is the best thing for the Knicks going forward. Their below average talent should not determine who their next pick is."
4765,2020-08-18 23:43:01,ic7opn,"Really really doubt that we will draft him. However it's possible that the FO jwill ust go BPA with our first pick and then nabs Kira/Nico/Maledon/some other pg with the Clippers pic. Im pretty high on Kira, so if he slips until our second pick i wouldn't mind drafting Toppin"
4766,2020-08-18 20:48:44,ic7opn,Killian Hayes being available seems like a better fit imo
4767,2020-08-18 19:52:50,ic7opn,If the Celtics take Dok over Tillman I will be like very mad. I like dok just Tillman is a lot better
4768,2020-08-18 21:01:40,ic7opn,That fit next to booker would be so nice especially with Rubio starting until Hayes can get better at on ball D and be more consistent love that pick for the suns
4769,2020-08-18 20:59:49,ic7opn,"I definitely like Maxey over Rj, but RJ is a really good athlete and definitely has a lot of upside that wasn’t used much in the NBL. Celtics fit would be good for both, but I would definitely rather have Maxey and him Cole is a toss up for me"
4770,2020-08-18 23:51:12,ic7opn,"Sorta how I feel about my Bulls at 7. I want Deni, but if we get our pick of Haliburton, Hayes, Okoro, and Vassell I'll be pretty happy."
4771,2020-08-19 18:05:38,ic7opn,"and vassell still on the board. the 8-12 range of this draft actually seems pretty strong, glad we ended up in that position."
4772,2020-08-19 09:59:59,ic7opn,yeah this makes no sense for the Sixers this is really as worse as it gets really nothing makes sense i dont wanna insult somebody but the dude that made the Sixers pick really is an idiot
4773,2020-08-18 23:25:15,ic7opn,"I'd be happy with any of those three wings.  I don't think the fit with Maxey makes much sense--I haven't seen any Spurs fans clamor for him until now.  But, ultimately, I want best player available or to trade back.  I would love to focus on frontcourt players."
4774,2020-08-18 19:52:05,ic7opn,"Poku on the Nuggets is so funny imagine a lineup of Bol, Jokic, Poku, MPJ, and Like Murray or someone. God that’s such a long lineup. As a Celtics fan I don’t love it and obviously there were no trades, but I think we will trade a lot of these picks. I guess Madar is fine for a stash just worried about actual upside with him"
4775,2020-08-19 04:21:29,ic7opn,Deni good for them
4776,2020-08-19 00:49:04,ic7opn,You mfers are way too gassed up on him lmao
4777,2020-08-19 11:22:01,ic7opn,And Terry in the second round
4778,2020-08-19 04:20:41,ic7opn,They did also draft a power forward three straight years. Maxey would be good pick for them or Cole Anthony. If want more solid bet haliburton or Haynes could develop to help Gram.
4779,2020-08-19 04:17:15,ic7opn,"Why would we take Ball, we had a passer in Rubio who also played defense and we traded him. If we can resign him Malik Beasley, I love our backcourt. Get a shooter or a defender."
4780,2020-08-19 06:02:06,ic7opn,Got me wondering as well...
4781,2020-08-18 20:44:38,ic7opn,I really don't get why Nico Mannion is still in the first round. Is there a successful guard in the NBA with his lack of size and complete inability to score (or even get attempts) in the paint? He's not even compensating with elite shooting or defensive skills.
4782,2020-08-18 23:22:59,ic7opn,I've never seen Bey go higher than 13 in any mock.  He seems to be in that 14-24 range in a lot of people's eyes.
4783,2020-08-19 13:50:44,ic7opn,"Mavs need shot creators lol Seth doesn’t do shit on-ball in high leverage situations and really neither do Wright/Brunson/THJ(well he does but he’s inefficient).

There’s also the fact that Theo has actual footspeed on the perimeter + length unlike Wright/Seth/THJ/Doncic/basically their whole roster except MKG and DFS. 

Maledon would be a great pick as long as Carlisle uses him. Who says he can’t be offball either? Dude played offball for ASVEL this year"
4784,2020-08-19 12:28:22,ic7opn,Wish they would've done that for Kira to fall to my Sixers.
4785,2020-08-18 19:48:30,ic7opn,It was such a weird pick for me. I feel like the Raps are such a good development team that they should always just take guys who have athletic tools and high upside. Even if you were to take a FVV replacement Riller is so much better and would be cool to watch next to Lowry.
4786,2020-08-18 20:33:13,ic7opn,"If they lose FVV, Cassius Winston isn't the worst guy they could replace him with. I'm assuming that's the thinking with that pick."
4787,2020-08-18 20:27:05,ic7opn,Nothing shameful with picking Maledon over Green?
4788,2020-08-19 10:03:07,ic7opn,"why is he being downvoted, he is right

the only thing the Mavs dont need is p&r ball handlers"
4789,2020-08-18 23:14:42,ic7opn,"Don't like the fit?  By what you're describing, he should fit well anywhere."
4790,2020-08-18 19:54:56,ic7opn,"I think it was on the Game Theory podcast a few months back where Hollinger (??) brought up that he didn't see much difference between Achiuwa and Paul Reed, which I think is a really fair question. 

Achiuwa is only like 8 months younger, wasn't as productive, and has similar strengths and weaknesses. Yet we see one in the top 10 and one in the bottom 10. That just seems like a massive gap."
4791,2020-08-20 01:06:57,ic7opn,Toppin at 6 is certainly not BPA especially if Hayes and Hal are available.
4792,2020-08-18 23:18:11,ic7opn,He definitely shot better from 3 than other guys in this draft who are supposedly elite shooters.
4793,2020-08-19 04:14:23,ic7opn,Toppin is a safe pick but not the 4th best player in the draft.
4794,2020-08-19 01:04:45,ic7opn,Congratulations on the wonderful news Bulls fans received last Friday (?) about Boylen. Happy days hopefully ahead for your team. Go on AK lad.
4795,2020-08-19 04:57:41,ic7opn,If you'd be happy with any of those 5 then I'm sure you'll end up happy lol. At least 2 will probably be there for you guya
4796,2020-08-18 23:31:35,ic7opn,"I just think the value of Maxey at 11 (particularly compared to Nesmith) is excellent. He wouldn’t be my choice, but taking a guy like Nesmith who hasn’t shown really any creation ability (for himself or others) and wasn’t a strong defender in college would be a huge bummer for the highest spurs draft pick in 20+ years 

And for what it’s worth Maxey kinda seems like a Patty replacement with real defensive upside and it would be cool to see what he’d learn from him"
4797,2020-08-18 20:06:49,ic7opn,"Lol that's exactly what I thought. They are building such a tall roster that Poku seems such a natural fit with them. They will also have the time to develop him without putting on him too much pressure.Yam is a steal at #47, remember my words.I've watched him in the playoff series against Deni and a very strong Maccabi Tel Aviv team, he looked really good there. Flashy, bouncy, handle the ball well with both hands, great on-ball defender, can finish in different ways, reserve lay ups, step backs, side steps etc. Has a large offensive package. Spencer Perlman has twitted about him just few days ago, claimed he worth even a first round pick.

Check some of his latest highlights on this channel:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z\_B7NC5C4Hw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_B7NC5C4Hw)"
4798,2020-08-19 04:22:21,ic7opn,"Yeah, let them have Deni."
4799,2020-08-19 15:27:52,ic7opn,I will gladly accept this lol
4800,2020-08-19 15:27:39,ic7opn,"Oh man didn’t even see that, that’s devastating"
4801,2020-08-19 04:23:01,ic7opn,"I would hate if the Hornets drafted Cole Anthony or Maxey considering the way to improve our back court would be to add size, not add more short guards"
4802,2020-08-19 11:52:29,ic7opn,"Thibs wanted his guy and it was a major mistake to replace Rubio with Teague. And we didn’t get run of Rubio cause he was too good of a passer.

If melo can become a 6’7” Rubio that is a willing shooter and better scorer all around, then we have an all star."
4803,2020-08-18 21:02:33,ic7opn,"The only thing I can think of is that people cant let go of the player they saw in the Nike Hoop Summit. I know it creeps into my head when I think about him, but its hard to ignore what I saw out of him in the half court at Arizona. In the open court hes deadly and has a great feel on when to kick ahead and slice."
4804,2020-08-19 00:42:29,ic7opn,I don't know why honestly.. 6'8 switchable forward shooting 45% from three. Good role player is his floor
4805,2020-08-19 15:12:01,ic7opn,"Maledon only takes 2 3s per game and his defense isnt good, yes he has length and could be a decent defender in the future but thats a stretch 

the Mavs lacks some specialist alongside Luka and Porzingis, especially on the wing positions or at SG - Maledon is none of that and even if he reached most of his potential he would be very similiar to what Delon Wright is right now

just makes no sense to draft him"
4806,2020-08-19 12:54:07,ic7opn,Hahhahaha on a second thought I think we need Kira more since Dragic is aging and Nunn is inconsistent. Also Herro is more of a 2 anyways. 😂
4807,2020-08-18 19:55:47,ic7opn,"For sure , I’d rather try and take guys with more potential or at least fit better with our core going forward. Even in terms of PGs I’d rather have Riller, Tre or Dotson or bigs like Nnaji Tillman or Reed 

Draft night is gonna be controversial I can see it"
4808,2020-08-18 20:51:55,ic7opn,I guess but there’s other PGs I like better
4809,2020-08-18 21:10:10,ic7opn,"It's a stupid pick. The last thing the Mavs need is an unathletic low-ceiling PG next to Luka -- they already got Delon Wright for that, and he's been a horrible fit."
4810,2020-08-18 23:21:24,ic7opn,"I’m talking in terms of him carving out his role, or unlocking his highest upside. With them I don’t think he gets either, they have Bridges as a combo forward and PJ Washington as a 4/5 so between them he’s sorta redundant (and they’re both more skilled). And they’re also pretty anemic offensively so I don’t see him finding his niche quite well. 

Phoenix would be a pretty good fit, maybe the Kings. SA obviously"
4811,2020-08-18 23:56:22,ic7opn,Hornets are filled with guys who’d fit anywhere but probably don’t have a top 100 player in the league. They need a guy who’s for higher end upside IMO
4812,2020-08-20 02:41:04,ic7opn,Oh yeah I agree with you that Toppin is not BPA at 6. It’s just that if the Knicks do think he is BPA they should take Toppin disregarding whether or not he’ll fit.
4813,2020-08-18 23:40:05,ic7opn,"What if Okoro, Toppin, or Okongwu were to fall to 11th?  Are you high on Vassell?"
4814,2020-08-19 04:25:32,ic7opn,I thought Anthony was a taller. Who do you want?
4815,2020-08-18 23:40:14,ic7opn,"He played with two bigs in the half court and like one real shooter. Not even taking to account the farther NBA line, he’s not ever gonna play in that scheme again. I think ppl are overreacting to how he looked in Arizona’s offense. 

He also won’t need to score as much as he was pressured into in college. He’s just a set up man who can hit the 3 a bit and get to the rim in transition"
4816,2020-08-19 01:01:22,ic7opn,I've seen a lot of debate over how good he actually is defensively.  Lotta people seem to think his defensive prowess is a bit overstated and question his lateral quickness.  I don't know enough to have any opinions on the matter.
4817,2020-08-18 21:18:00,ic7opn,Sure but also Winston probably has a similar scouting report to FVV out of college except the production was much higher
4818,2020-08-18 20:56:47,ic7opn,Cassius has the IQ of all those guys you like put together.
4819,2020-08-18 21:15:15,ic7opn,Imagine calling Theo unathletic or low ceiling
4820,2020-08-18 21:25:07,ic7opn,">unathletic

Maledon has a solid first step and great size at his position. He's not a jump out of the gym athlete, but that isn't really a weakness in his game. Compared to someone like Winston or even Killian Hayes, I'm not particularly worried about his physical ability.

>low-ceiling 

I disagree. He's one of the youngest players in the draft, is a versatile shooter, has a great finishing touch, strives as a PnR operator. If all of these skills translate long-term, that's a very good offensive player to have."
4821,2020-08-18 23:31:13,ic7opn,"How about a small ball lineup of Graham, Rozier, Bridges, Washington, and Achiuwa?"
4822,2020-08-19 00:46:24,ic7opn,I want him on the Mavs too replace Dwight Powell as our rim runner and actually provide rebounding and versatile defense.
4823,2020-08-19 02:05:16,ic7opn,"I think Devonte’ and Cody are top 100 but overall agree.

Though Monk probably has more realistic star potential than people realise; even he is probably more an offball guard in his prime, a 2nd/3rd option type."
4824,2020-08-18 23:50:26,ic7opn,"I like all of them over Nesmith. I’d probably go Okoro-Pat Williams-Vassell-Okongwu-Maxey-Toppin-Nesmith. I really like Okoro, Williams and Vassell. I’d have Vassell over Williams in a vacuum, but I like Williams in SA with the existing young core a ton"
4825,2020-08-19 04:33:02,ic7opn,"Well I’d want Wiseman, Ball, Edwards, Okongwu, Avdija, Hayes, Haliburton, and Vassell in that order. Edwards and below is just going with BPA but also the better fit for the team."
4826,2020-08-19 02:17:39,ic7opn,So exactly the opposite of what the Sixers need
4827,2020-08-18 23:22:43,ic7opn,"Don't take it from me, here's an in-depth scouting report:

https://www.thestepien.com/2020/02/07/theo-maledon-scouting-report/

Now let's hear yours, genius."
4828,2020-08-18 23:06:27,ic7opn,"I look at Maledon, I see another Delon Wright in the making, more or less. Size, ""solid"", versatile combo guard, etc. Seriously, tell me how do you see this guy a level better.

Finally, the point is that this kind of player is not a fit for the Mavs next to Luka.  We need elite defense, more athleticism, off-ball offense, not another PG there -- his skills would be wasted.  

I mean, if he was a clear BPA, a star in the making, you can go for it and worry about the fit later. But this is clearly not the case, there other players that fit the Mavs better, and this guy would make much more sense for a team without a Doncic on it."
4829,2020-08-18 23:34:22,ic7opn,Not enough shooting and he also gets relegated to mostly rim running in that group. My thinking with them is that PJ is lowkey a small-ball 5 and Miles a 4. If they’re playing with a big it should be a Wiseman type
4830,2020-08-19 00:51:34,ic7opn,"Yeah if he “falls” to Dallas that’s the perfect fit. Was just giving teams in the similar range as in this mock. But yeah Porzingis stretching the floor and Luka getting him easy baskets. Spread offense to allow him to terrorize the paint. Great coaching

That’s actually the kinda situation I could see him hitting his ceiling in"
4831,2020-08-18 23:55:22,ic7opn,"I'm honestly really looking forward to this draft, and even the unveiling of the lottery order on Thursday.  I know, though, come draft day, the Spurs are gonna leave us extremely puzzled and disappointed with some left field selection that strikes us as the total opposite of what we ourselves woulda done and their refusal to engage in any trades."
4832,2020-08-19 02:21:02,ic7opn,"Well they def need a backup pg in general. His (theoretical) shooting should help, and they have enough weapons that he wouldn’t need to score and would be looking to get the right guys shots. He"
4833,2020-08-18 23:42:10,ic7opn,"Yeah, I was basically laughing when I wrote it.  I'm rooting for you guys.  Would love to see the Hornets pull themselves out of this eternal obscurity."
4834,2020-08-19 14:24:54,ic7opn,"Yeah, definitely feel like the Hornets could prioritize a rim defender.  They were a bottom 5 rebounding and shot blocking team and could easily upgrade over Zeller/Biyombo."
4835,2020-08-19 16:41:31,ic7opn,"not enough shooting?! That's a killer shooting lineup. PJ would play the 5 and just sit in the corner. Rozier on catch and shoot was incredible this year, devonte' is in the 99% tile of 3 pt shooters. Miles is average and has gotten better at 3s every year, and PJ is PJ."
4836,2020-08-19 00:27:00,ic7opn,"I I mean I’m so jacked for the lottery even if it is a weak class and it’s a 10% chance we move up. ’m *cautiously* optimistic about the draft. The Luka pick was definitely not my favorite, but Keldon and DWhite were good value picks that turned out great and Dejounte and Lonnie were upside swings we really never never take and I was pumped at the time. Hoping this year is more of the same, I feel like Brian Wright has really emphasized athleticism and I’m all for it"
4837,2020-08-19 02:48:42,ic7opn,We need good shooting and shot creators. No secondary playmaking guard is one of our biggest weaknesses
4838,2020-08-18 23:49:10,ic7opn,Not a hornets fan lol but yeah me too I’d like to see them become relevant. Kinda crazy they’ve been trash for years while NC is called “Hoop state” lol
4839,2020-08-19 17:19:16,ic7opn,"Ball in Graham’s hands, he’s got Precious who is a non shooter (which forces him to be the rim runner and goes to my point about the fit not being great for his development) and Bridges who is well below league average."
4840,2020-08-19 18:29:36,ic7opn,"We were middle of the pack in terms of attempts and average.  We’re already a solid shooting team, but you can never have too many shooters!"
4841,2020-08-19 02:51:27,ic7opn,He pretty much fills those holes
4842,2020-08-19 17:26:15,ic7opn,"regardless whoever they put on the floor with those 4 guys is gonna be the defacto cody zeller type. i'd much rather have a dude who is athletic and can move his feet defensively than wiseman who looks like he has KAT feet on that end. ultimately to get the most out of that team they are gonna have to hope PJ can bulk up and play the 5 like Bam, I don't really see a point in grabbing a slow center and trying to make him fit."
4843,2020-08-19 19:03:42,ic7opn,"for sure. i would want killian before precious, but also just anxious to see if we move up."
4844,2020-08-19 17:31:52,ic7opn,"Well again goes to my point, if I’m Precious’ agent I don’t want him going there. And idk you probably just have a different opinion of him but I think a Wiseman dominating the paint is what they need (from this draft). Or around the league, a Mitchell Robinson. 7fter that will run, rebound and defend the paint, someone else pointed out they’re a bottom 5 rebounding and shot locking team"
4845,2020-08-19 17:36:03,ic7opn,"Maybe in this small ball lineup Achiuwa is the 5 and not PJ. Precious could maybe have some hidden Bam Adebayo type of potential if used properly.

 He's got similar measurables and has the defensive potential to be a small ball 5 in that way. His playmaking would definitely need work, be he's also a guy who was a wing in high school, so he could be able to handle the ball a lot better than we got to see at Memphis, we didn't see it from Bam either in college."

The hornets just need someone with length and lateral foot speed. If a Rudy Gobert existed this draft, then sure go for it, I just don't think Wiseman has anywhere near that defensive potential and having a slow 5 is a death sentence defensively."

Marvel films in Atlanta now, and the New Avenger's HQ upstate is actually the Porsche Experience Center in Atlanta. None of that would have happened without Tyler Perry's influence (and Georgia's tax breaks)"

4911,2020-08-18 02:12:04,ibr3cp,"I’m not your guy, sorry. I have mixed feelings about his films. I watched Acrimony last night at the request of my girlfriend and while I think it’s great he’s getting black people on screen, in ownership in media, and representation in production jobs, I can’t help but feel that I’m watching the bastard lovechild of a Novella and a blacksploitation film.  

...But he’s getting people paid. 

...yet it feels kinda icky. 

From what I’ve seen his work is inundated with old and demeaning stereotypes. That seems to be his niche. Acrimony to me was ridiculous but managed to be just entertaining enough to not turn off. Mostly because we wondered if things were going to turn out how we thought. We got really close  to calling it quits a couple times, though.

4982,2020-08-17 00:15:25,ib26os,Forbort has looked really solid. Today wasn't his best game but he's done well in his role thus far. Valimaki hasnt played an nhl game in an entire year and is coming off a pretty big injury. Might not be the best time to just throw him in the fire.
4983,2020-08-17 14:09:47,ib26os,"I think you are understating how bad he’s been. Certainly he’s been a step behind, but that’s led him to take horrible penalties in multiple games that he shouldn’t be taking. And most of them are just penalties he takes because he is not moving his feet, out of position, etc. I think we can expect more from the captain and number 1 pairing."
4984,2020-08-17 01:07:01,ib26os,That’s why I hate the throw valimaki in comments. He hasn’t played an NHL/AHL game all year and came off a really big injury. Would be senseless to throw him out there and expect him to be 100% up to speed right away and also really bad asset management to force him into the line up and now have to protect him. They have 6 really good options and really I wouldn’t blame the losses on bad Defence.
4985,2020-08-17 02:27:20,ib26os,"Dude forbort has been very on and off. Very decent plays but when he fucks up, its costly. His passing is 70% of the time is not tape to tape. Sure hes done a good job at his role, but i dont see why we cant fit brodie in for the pk1, kylington fills for forbort and i think id rather take my chances with kylington than forbort considering kylington would actually create very good offensive opportunities. It's just the fact that we have a better option. Thats what gets me salty about forbort."
4986,2020-08-17 14:21:53,ib26os,"> most of them are just penalties he takes because he is not moving his feet, out of position, etc.

That's really my point. He's just not putting himself in the right spot like we are used to seeing and that's cascading into other problems. I still don't think he's been ""a disaster"" but he's not been the same #1 guy we are usually able to rely on in all situations. 

For a long time he's been our best and most reliable player on the ice so being upset that he's not that guy right now is absolutely understandable and he deserves the scrutiny so don't think that I'm defending him here. 

I just think that he looks terrible because he's just a few steps out of place and he's slow to react to changes on the ice - if he can figure that out the other issues disappear and we know that he has the experience to realize this himself... which makes it all the more frustrating to watch."
4987,2020-08-17 02:28:11,ib26os,Kylington?
4988,2020-08-17 14:27:29,ib26os,"Ya I agree with you for sure, and honestly I think the fan base is a little hard on the guy. Yes he won the Norris, but he’s not getting any younger so honestly why be surprised. That’s why I have my doubts a lot of his issues can be figured out. Some things like not pinching at certain times would make a difference, but other times he’s just being exposed/on his heals. Quite frankly it’s like the game is coming at him too fast"
4989,2020-08-17 03:19:51,ib26os,"Nah. He’s a turnover machine. Forbort’s been solid as hell. He’s not here to chip in offensively. He’s here to be a steady defensive guy. He’s doesn’t have to create much opportunities as he’s supposed to stop them from happening against us.  Big take, but I honestly think he’s been more solid than Hamonic."
4990,2020-08-17 14:45:45,ib26os,Fair enough. I really hope you are wrong but only time can tell.
4991,2020-08-17 03:39:37,ib26os,"Wrong take bud... he's costed us several goals this round from poor d play. not turnovers, just bad bad coverage."
4992,2020-08-17 17:04:37,ib26os,"Oh trust me, I hope I am wrong too. Would love Gio to keep proving all the doubters wrong like he’s done all his career"
4993,2020-08-17 04:37:37,ib26os,The one pavelski goal happened specifically because he dove to the ice in stead of blocking the far corner shooting lane

5198,2020-08-14 05:31:17,i9g3d1,"We might score more goals if he skated with any kind of speed or conviction. 

Like honestly he was barely present this game, and he's a shrinking violet from any kind of physical play. Give me Chucky or Looch or Dubes over Johnny any day. They play their fucking hearts out every minute they're on the ice."
5199,2020-08-14 05:29:35,i9g3d1,"I always root for Dallas, and when I dont, it's football season."
5200,2020-08-14 05:45:06,i9g3d1,"lindholm has been the most consistent player so ill give him that, but johnny’s turnovers have been costing them good plays. monahan isnt bad but has been pretty quiet? especially considering he’s our top center. plus the second line has been nowhere to be found, namely backlund."
5201,2020-08-14 06:06:25,i9g3d1,Lindholm has lowkey been invisible outside of a few hits and a play on the powerplay. He only looked good when he was away from the other top line guys
5202,2020-08-14 05:49:34,i9g3d1,He’s almost always invisible in 5 on 5 play in the playoffs. Most of his points come off the PP but there’s a lot more expected of you as a #1C than to just do well on the PP.
5203,2020-08-14 08:24:51,i9g3d1,"If you thought Monahan was invisible tonight, you weren't paying attention. He wasn't great offensively, but he was actually throwing his body around."
5204,2020-08-14 08:33:32,i9g3d1,"And that's worth more than and of the goal scorers? Monahan had as many hits, Lindholm had 6,  Bennet 7, and Mangiapane 8.

Wouldn't Bennet, with 7 hits and a Goal, have more to do with the Win?"
5205,2020-08-14 06:08:40,i9g3d1,"Did he get conkied? He wasn’t limping, moreso than he was wobbly like he was out of it"
5206,2020-08-14 08:51:43,i9g3d1,He hasn’t been great for us tbh. Although we really aren’t using him in ways that line up with his talents for some reason. It’s actually been really frustrating.
5207,2020-08-14 05:43:59,i9g3d1,"Ahhhhhh I thought he started last game too, my bad"
5208,2020-08-14 05:41:51,i9g3d1,"I do love a big hit, but I hate seeing players getting hurt. I hope he comes back soon"

5210,2020-08-14 05:39:28,i9g3d1,I'm sure they dont want another cut throat on the ice
5211,2020-08-14 05:38:35,i9g3d1,"Yeah, that’s fair. I guess it’s the whole “distinct kicking motion” thing when a good 50% of the time, it’s not distinct. Like, have these people seen what a kick looks like? If I stub my toe on something, I didn’t kick it - I was moving forward and I made contact with it."
5212,2020-08-14 16:48:30,i9g3d1,"8 times lol. Flames lost game 2 in the finals in 04 and made round 2 one other time since then which was in 2015, losing game 2 in both of those series. So there’s the extra game 2 losses."

5217,2020-08-14 05:37:27,i9g3d1,No shit. I flew down to Dallas to see us play the Wild 3 seasons ago (maybe 4?) and we were down 4-0 and managed to come back to tie it at 4. We still lost 5-4 but that shit was insane.

5220,2020-08-14 05:45:24,i9g3d1,"He was excellent for the first three games against Winnipeg. He's been pretty invisible for the three games since, but also hasn't been a liability when on the ice."
5221,2020-08-14 05:39:52,i9g3d1,"> Give me Chucky or Looch or Dubes over Johnny any day. They play their fucking hearts out every minute they're on the ice.

I don't understand this. I mean obviously Dube has been our best forward. No debating that. But Looch? The guy who was giving Winnipeg 2 on 1s galore with his bad passes? And Tkachuk? Honestly, he's disappointing me far more than Gaudreau.

Look, I need more from Gaudreau in the offensive end, but he was our best forward in the first three games against Winnipeg overall. A few bad games by him and good ones from others and Flames fans short memory strikes again.

I feel like Tkachuk and Giordano have been worse than Johnny overall in the playoffs if we're talking core guys."
5222,2020-08-14 06:39:07,i9g3d1,"This is something I can definitely respect, although it'll be interesting to see what the cowboys do with a new head coach finally"
5223,2020-08-14 11:53:10,i9g3d1,"Come on man, he's been fucking terrible. He's our #1 center and he's played 30 minutes of 5on5 ice time in this series so far without registering a single shot. During that time he has the worst 5on5 CF% on our entire team. But you are cool with him being utterly ineffective offensively because he threw a couple hits????"
5224,2020-08-14 16:58:02,i9g3d1,"I didn't say it was worth more, didn't say I agreed either. Just giving the likely reasoning. And quantity =\= quality, the hits Lucic threw were thunderous."
5225,2020-08-14 08:22:55,i9g3d1,"He braced himself to be hit from Benn from one side, without noticing another player was on his other side and they smacked heads, Tkachuk getting the worst of it. Plus earlier in the game Benn hit him in the groin with his stick, which caused Tkachuk to leave twice in the first period."
5226,2020-08-14 06:47:52,i9g3d1,You sir are an asshole
5227,2020-08-14 05:43:30,i9g3d1,"I agree, they need to update the rule to include falling down. Who can kick while falling on their ass"
5228,2020-08-14 06:08:09,i9g3d1,Was that the game where Niemi allowed 3 goals on two shots?
5229,2020-08-14 16:35:08,i9g3d1,Except for that last goal
5230,2020-08-14 05:45:53,i9g3d1,"I disagree that they have been worse than Johnny if only because Johnny is basically invisible. 

I do agree that Looch makes some bad plays but here's the thing with Looch: he so obviously cares. I can forgive a guy who is trying hard and just can't connect. Johnny just doesn't give it his all. 

That ONE backcheck in the Winnipeg series was the kind of energy I want to see from him regularly. He would be so incredible if he hustled like that all the time."
5231,2020-08-14 16:32:52,i9g3d1,"Whole new staff, pretty much."
5232,2020-08-14 17:02:06,i9g3d1,Maybe you need to learn to read. All I said is he was not invisible.
5233,2020-08-14 08:49:27,i9g3d1,"He 100% looked concussed to me, I hope I’m wrong but that wobble is textbook :(."
5234,2020-08-14 13:21:14,i9g3d1,It sure was
5235,2020-08-14 16:53:06,i9g3d1,First goal against he's been on the ice for the entire playoffs
5236,2020-08-14 05:51:43,i9g3d1,"I agree his energy hasn't been what I'd like to see in the last few games. His shift at the end of Game 2 with the goalie pulled where he was all over the ice and eventually drew a penalty is what we need to see more of.

Either way, it's still frustrating to me that when the team fails, instead of looking for what actually went wrong with the team, Flames fans jump to ""Gaudreau bad"". We scored 4 goals. We allowed 5. Maybe we should examine why we allowed 5 goals, but no, Johnny not scoring is the problem."
5237,2020-08-14 16:38:44,i9g3d1,Good. 5 years too late but better than nothing
5238,2020-08-14 17:52:48,i9g3d1,Nah I read just fine thanks. You jumped into this thread to defend him while seemingly holding him to a standard worthy of a 4th liner. He's our #1 center if he's not in possession of the puck in the other teams zone and his entire line fails to generate so much as a single high danger scoring chance in the series then he is invisible.
5239,2020-08-14 16:59:15,i9g3d1,"Yeah, me too. I'm hoping otherwise, but I don't expect him back."
5240,2020-08-14 18:15:01,i9g3d1,To be fair Johnny was caught out of position on the game winning goal too. So it’s both offence and defence that he’s been struggling with
5241,2020-08-14 18:03:11,i9g3d1,"Clearly you don't read just fine because in that post I outright stated he wasn't playing great offensively.

5249,2020-08-13 07:39:34,i8v824,"You can't quantify what you call ""contributions"". The cinematography of an Orson Welles film, for example, is not an equal ""contribution"" to its screenplay. Likewise the screenplay of a Coen Brothers film is not an equal ""contribution"" to its sound design. Different directors have different priorities.

You're trying to approach this like mathematics, and in doing so missing the point of any utility the auteur theory has in the study of film. The auteur theory was developed as a way of trying to convince people in France in the '50s that film should be taken as seriously as literature, and a big obstacle to consider when comparing to literature is the presence of the studio system. The studio system means that directors' visions are often 'consumed' by the corporate mass of the production and so artistic vision is sacrificed and becomes part of the overall greyness of the factoryline-assembled 'product' churned out by the studio. The French theorists of the '50s called a director like this a 'scene setter' or 'Metteur en scène'. These directors just took a screenplay they were given and, as Truffaut said, put images to it.

The opposite is the auteur, who even though he or she (often) works within the studio system, their artistic vision can be detected *despite this*. We don't call Hitchcock an auteur because we can count the number of different credits he gets (as writer, director, producer, etc.) This wouldn't tell us much that's useful. We call him an auteur because we can recognise consistent elements of style across his filmography that the studio system did not squash out of him or force him to compromise.

And yes, the director works with others. But the director's job in a film is never just to direct the actors, despite the name. The director also oversees the production. Their name may not be given a writing credit or a cinematography credit, but nonetheless they do contribute to all aspects of the production because they work with each of the people in these roles and - if they are an auteur - they shape the artistic decisions in the direction of their own style. This is why a Coen brothers film has a distinctive and consistent visual 'look' even if Roger Deakins isn't the cinematographer.

So, again, counting roles makes no sense, because the auteur director is puppet master controlling all decisions in all areas of the production. You can't approach film studies like maths: to decide who does or doesn't qualify as an 'auteur' we must look at the things they produce and analyse them with our own subjective and qualitative appraisal."

5330,2020-08-11 17:27:39,i7skvb,"These two teams are so evenly matched on paper. PP, PK, season standings, both teams getting three points off each other. Flames with a few more GF and Stars with slightly better save %. I think you're right, those will be the deciding factors."
5331,2020-08-11 16:43:12,i7skvb,I saw somewhere that they’re both probable for the game though
5332,2020-08-11 18:26:54,i7skvb,Game 1 or Game 4 would be best.

5339,2020-08-11 15:05:22,i7skvb,I’m in Japan. I’m hoping when the Flames burn the Stars the schedule is a bit more forgiving with 8 teams. Luckily this week is a holiday so no big today
5340,2020-08-11 19:12:13,i7skvb,I thought game 3 was our best game personally

5382,2020-08-11 22:28:16,i7rtif,Sometimes I wonder how we can even be labeled a “defensive” team
5383,2020-08-11 22:37:47,i7rtif,Remember when Seguin had a four goal game against the Flames or when Jamie had six points in the same game
5384,2020-08-11 22:43:27,i7rtif,"Take possession of the puck, everyone gets in the zone, and we gently and politely give the puck away."

Sekera: walked for an easy goal, backs off and allows an easy shot on the rush. Still getting tons of minutes"
5390,2020-08-11 23:15:20,i7rtif,I guess we 'won' that period.
5391,2020-08-11 23:34:21,i7rtif,Korpisalo is a fucking MONSTER
5392,2020-08-11 23:39:36,i7rtif,I hope whatever is wrong with Johns had nothing to do with his head.

5394,2020-08-11 23:59:37,i7rtif,Miro doing the most - here’s hoping he gets rewarded for throwing pucks at the net
5395,2020-08-11 14:11:10,i7rtif,"Okay here we go!!!! They were just saving up all the goals for the actual playoffs.  Keeping their cards close to their chest and all. 
 Our rockets are ready, Jamie can show Tkachuk how to be petty, and a brick wall in net!  

Also I did not have breakfast tacos, so no worries there.  

Requests:  let's have some fun, a goal from the top line and PPG would be fun, and also making Calgary angry at our brick wall tendies!  LET'S PRACTICE FIRE SAFETY!  GO STARS!"

5399,2020-08-11 22:01:56,i7rtif,"Idk why everyone is mad at Radulov, that was a pretty fuckin’ weak interference call"
5400,2020-08-11 22:06:01,i7rtif,The best thing Perry can do for us is fight Tkachuk and get off the ice on a penalty

5410,2020-08-11 22:18:48,i7rtif,sweet defense. that was as bad as it gets. Pure laziness
5411,2020-08-11 22:19:05,i7rtif,Sekera didn't seem to realize he was being taken on until it was over
5412,2020-08-11 22:20:15,i7rtif,Sekera for defensive cone of the year

Last time I had a beer was second period against LV, and haven't had one since.   I take all responsibility and will volunteer as tribute for tonights game."
5416,2020-08-11 22:45:52,i7rtif,I just realized all the Flames look the same to me right now because none of them have gotten hair cuts since the shutdown and they all just look like unkempt cavemen
5417,2020-08-11 22:46:17,i7rtif,I bet other goalies love playing the stars.  We always make them look life hall of famers
5418,2020-08-11 22:57:53,i7rtif,Not sure what the FUCK that Benn goal was (lol Talbot) but maybe we wake up now

5423,2020-08-11 23:05:53,i7rtif,Sekera exposed AGAIN.
5424,2020-08-11 23:07:00,i7rtif,"Mind blowing.... Sekera is still getting ice time. Some other comments were pointing out how its okay because he doesnt get that much ice time, but he’s literally a liability"
5425,2020-08-11 23:10:56,i7rtif,3 OT COMING FOR JACKETS/LIGHTENING.  Playoff hockey is the best playoff format!
5426,2020-08-11 23:11:14,i7rtif,Janmark-Hintz-Gurianov might have something if they're kept together

5539,2020-08-11 22:13:13,i7rtif,Johns and Oleksiak know to go after Dube now
5540,2020-08-11 22:13:18,i7rtif,Dobby for MVP
5541,2020-08-11 22:16:33,i7rtif,Everybody has been giving Segs and Benn shit for being awful but my god Radulov has declined so much
5542,2020-08-11 22:18:32,i7rtif,WHY IS SEKERA STILL PLAYING
5543,2020-08-11 22:18:39,i7rtif,Sekera exposed AGAIN
5544,2020-08-11 22:18:44,i7rtif,Can somebody break this cunt’s jaw
5545,2020-08-11 22:19:41,i7rtif,One team looks clearly faster right now. Just lazy defense
5546,2020-08-11 22:20:02,i7rtif,Fedun> Sekera
5547,2020-08-11 22:21:47,i7rtif,is Benn worried about our scoring now?
5548,2020-08-11 22:22:57,i7rtif,Guri and Hintz need to be leading us in forward TOI.
5549,2020-08-11 22:23:02,i7rtif,Someone needs to tell the stars we don’t have to start the series down 1-0 as well as the game
5550,2020-08-11 22:23:08,i7rtif,Wait...we gotta score THREE goals to win now??? Fuck!
5551,2020-08-11 22:23:49,i7rtif,"Playing like ""fucking horse shit"""
5552,2020-08-11 22:26:02,i7rtif,"Need some positive vibes for the boys! Time to turn it around, get the legs GOING, use space to make smart plays, oh and BENCH SEKERA lol"
5553,2020-08-11 22:27:58,i7rtif,"Penalties kill us. Rads killed us. Sekera is so slow, didn’t even look like he was supposed to be in the NHL."
5554,2020-08-11 22:30:02,i7rtif,Watching the Blue Jackets and Lightning has been more fun
5555,2020-08-11 22:31:10,i7rtif,Considering the situation Miro and Klingberg need to play together to try and generate offense.
5556,2020-08-11 22:36:36,i7rtif,"For me, the most discouraging aspect of this is that they have been playing harder than previous games, and it's clear they know that they need to get better - and we are still plagued by the same stupid crap.

The Big 12 better not cancel the season because I do NOT want my Stars getting laughed out of Edmonton to be my final sports experience for the year."
5557,2020-08-11 22:43:47,i7rtif,I hate how this team just can not pass for about 5 minutes a period
5558,2020-08-11 22:50:01,i7rtif,Nice move by Kling
5559,2020-08-11 22:58:22,i7rtif,"Stars goals come in bunches, more please."
5560,2020-08-11 23:00:08,i7rtif,We're... alive?
5561,2020-08-11 23:05:16,i7rtif,Sekera I strongly dislike you
5562,2020-08-11 23:06:02,i7rtif,Sekera fuck-up leading to a goal. DRINK
5563,2020-08-11 23:07:27,i7rtif,FFS that's 2 goals Sekera directly caused. Get him the fuck out of there!!!
5564,2020-08-11 23:07:55,i7rtif,Send Sekera home. Get out of the bubble. Do not return. Your “services” are no longer needed.
5565,2020-08-11 23:09:31,i7rtif,Wtf sekera that wasn’t even close
5566,2020-08-11 23:11:31,i7rtif,Lightning vs. Blue Jackets are going to 3OT. Intense. Got both games up side by side.
5567,2020-08-11 23:27:49,i7rtif,"Jackets Bolts 3OT stat: Now over 60 mins since last goal

Stars: 😬"
5568,2020-08-11 23:44:28,i7rtif,"We need to score an actual goal. I’ll take the garbage ones every day, but we need a skill or team goal."
5569,2020-08-11 23:49:35,i7rtif,"""Dobby said, No"""
5570,2020-08-11 23:59:02,i7rtif,This game really boutta end before the cbj-tb game
5571,2020-08-12 00:01:34,i7rtif,"Sounds silly, but our comfort playing behind could be a big help in a deep cup run."
5572,2020-08-12 00:10:06,i7rtif,Sit that piece of trash Sekera and they might have a chance. Doesn’t excuse the lack of scoring but damn.
5573,2020-08-11 23:18:45,i7rtif,"Without Sekera in the lineup we would be winning right now.

Just saying."
5574,2020-08-11 13:58:50,i7rtif,"Let’s see if anyone brought a fire extinguisher to Edmonton. If we lose, we’re the ones who will be on fire."
5575,2020-08-11 14:59:25,i7rtif,LFG BOYS!
5576,2020-08-11 17:18:29,i7rtif,LETS FUCKIN GO STARS!
5577,2020-08-11 17:42:06,i7rtif,"My buddy is a Flames fan. If there's one thing we agree on it's that my other buddy is a loser for being an Oilers fan. 

Let's. Go. Stars."
5578,2020-08-11 20:19:37,i7rtif,"I am really struggling to stay focused at work, and it isn't even game time yet. I am super pumped."
5579,2020-08-11 21:23:41,i7rtif,"Flames fan here! Here’s hoping for a tight and exciting series! 

You guys were my go-to team when I got my first NHL game back in 2001 as a wee lad, I LOVED those jerseys and wish you’d bring them back. 

Let’s go hockey!"
5580,2020-08-11 21:35:15,i7rtif,we're gonna score a goal in the first period dont @ me
5581,2020-08-11 21:42:40,i7rtif,GOT MY JERSEY ON! LET'S FUCKIN' GOOOOO!
5582,2020-08-11 21:50:36,i7rtif,I would like a little better passing
5583,2020-08-11 21:50:53,i7rtif,I wanna see more of this big rig hitting lucic business
5584,2020-08-11 21:53:54,i7rtif,Well we survived five minutes
5585,2020-08-11 21:54:47,i7rtif,"“Hintz with speed.” 
Yep. That’s what he does..."
5586,2020-08-11 21:58:00,i7rtif,A Seguin goal would make me soooooo happy
5587,2020-08-11 21:59:45,i7rtif,So fucking weak
5588,2020-08-11 22:00:56,i7rtif,Dicky got caught and beat bad on that one.
5589,2020-08-11 22:00:57,i7rtif,F
5590,2020-08-11 22:01:26,i7rtif,What is that backcheck bro?!
5591,2020-08-11 22:01:28,i7rtif,Dickinson can't get walked that far up the ice on the kill
5592,2020-08-11 22:01:52,i7rtif,WAKE THE FUCK UP BOYS
5593,2020-08-11 22:02:37,i7rtif,Good hit by Klinger on Lucic lol
5594,2020-08-11 22:05:10,i7rtif,bitchfiiiight

5596,2020-08-11 22:05:40,i7rtif,2 of the most hated guys in the NHL. Whoopdeedooo
5597,2020-08-11 22:05:43,i7rtif,Good job Perry
5598,2020-08-11 22:06:19,i7rtif,"That trade's a win for us, no?"
5599,2020-08-11 22:08:35,i7rtif,why is it always my boy!?!?!
5600,2020-08-11 22:08:45,i7rtif,That was a cheap shot
5601,2020-08-11 22:08:51,i7rtif,FUCk don't be hurt
5602,2020-08-11 22:08:52,i7rtif,Flames have got a reputation for stuff like this.
5603,2020-08-11 22:08:54,i7rtif,Someone better light up Dube for that shit.
5604,2020-08-11 22:09:02,i7rtif,What the absolute fuck was that
5605,2020-08-11 22:09:07,i7rtif,Sick cross check you fuck
5606,2020-08-11 22:09:14,i7rtif,What is the deal with the chip ins? Is that just a core strategy for the stars? I feel like I don’t see any other teams chipping in very often.
5607,2020-08-11 22:09:14,i7rtif,It's not his face for once! Hope that knee is okay.
5608,2020-08-11 22:09:24,i7rtif,How is that not a major? What the fuck.
5609,2020-08-11 22:09:31,i7rtif,"PP .... LET'S TIE IT 

(yes, I'm yelling)"
5610,2020-08-11 22:09:35,i7rtif,Of course Dickinson lol
5611,2020-08-11 22:09:47,i7rtif,Cross checking? Seemed more like boarding to me
5612,2020-08-11 22:10:20,i7rtif,Not happy with how these majors turn into minors.
5613,2020-08-11 22:10:20,i7rtif,I need Dube to be punched in the face. Please.
5614,2020-08-11 22:10:26,i7rtif,*crowd chants* “Refs you suck!”
5615,2020-08-11 22:10:28,i7rtif,How is that not a freaking Major.
5616,2020-08-11 22:11:26,i7rtif,So we get set up then we stand still?
5617,2020-08-11 22:11:51,i7rtif,Just fucking shoot. I'm getting so frustrated
5618,2020-08-11 22:13:04,i7rtif,Dobby is my favorite

5623,2020-08-11 22:18:08,i7rtif,I am displeased by the latest development
5624,2020-08-11 22:18:11,i7rtif,Sekera is fucking trash
5625,2020-08-11 22:18:16,i7rtif,my god Sekera is terrible
5626,2020-08-11 22:18:45,i7rtif,Raise your hand if you’re shocked that was sekera.....exactly
5627,2020-08-11 22:19:02,i7rtif,Sucks but not unexpected
5628,2020-08-11 22:19:26,i7rtif,We can't pass for shit. We don't shoot for fuck know's why. Ugh.
5629,2020-08-11 22:21:13,i7rtif,Sekera fuck up leading to a goal is officially being added to my game bingo card
5630,2020-08-11 22:21:33,i7rtif,Ahhh razor idk if I’d call the Blues game a great game for the stars
5631,2020-08-11 22:23:11,i7rtif,Sekera more like sukera.. amarite guys? Ugh this is painful.
5632,2020-08-11 22:35:42,i7rtif,"I spilled coffee on my Green shirt this morning and switched to Red. Just now found my backup Green shirt and put that on.


Sorry everyone."
5633,2020-08-11 22:37:26,i7rtif,Put Sekera at left bench!!!

5639,2020-08-11 22:58:53,i7rtif,mas por favor
5640,2020-08-11 23:00:58,i7rtif,"Just tuned in right in time for both goals, Go Stars!"
5641,2020-08-11 23:02:37,i7rtif,Corey Perry with a Roussel type game today
5642,2020-08-11 23:05:12,i7rtif,SEKERA AGAIN JESUS CHRIST
5643,2020-08-11 23:05:32,i7rtif,Holy shit Sekera
5644,2020-08-11 23:05:38,i7rtif,JFC GET SEKERA OFF THE ICE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD
5645,2020-08-11 23:06:06,i7rtif,If sekera was a rookie his ass would have been benched by now. 2 of the 3 goals against are on sekera
5646,2020-08-11 23:06:25,i7rtif,"I've had enough of Sekera, Fedun is right there."
5647,2020-08-11 23:08:53,i7rtif,Why the fuck is Sekera still playing? Call Fedun up instead or something
5648,2020-08-11 23:10:18,i7rtif,Why the fuck is Sekera still out there.
5649,2020-08-11 23:10:20,i7rtif,Sekera wtf shot was that?
5650,2020-08-11 23:11:13,i7rtif,Why is it commercials any time we get any momentum whatsoever
5651,2020-08-11 23:26:19,i7rtif,Glad they are calling out sekera
5652,2020-08-11 23:30:15,i7rtif,hintz with 7:30 of ice time and gurianov with 8:34.  incredible coaching
5653,2020-08-11 23:34:46,i7rtif,Johns out rest of the game.
5654,2020-08-11 23:34:49,i7rtif,johns out but not sekera noooo
5655,2020-08-11 23:36:06,i7rtif,Is Johns protesting Sekera as his d partner? I support you Johnsy.  Seriously tho I hope Stephen is okay.
5656,2020-08-11 23:45:21,i7rtif,Alright boys 13 minutes for glory!
5657,2020-08-11 23:48:59,i7rtif,It scares me every time sekera is last man
5658,2020-08-11 23:53:42,i7rtif,I hope that wasn't our scoring for the week
5659,2020-08-11 23:58:54,i7rtif,If you are in Texas and not streaming the game you would be missing the entire game because of the Tampa Columbia game
5660,2020-08-11 23:59:13,i7rtif,Miro is so silky it's incredible
5661,2020-08-12 00:08:59,i7rtif,TOO MUCH PASSING
5662,2020-08-12 00:09:35,i7rtif,Hope Nill likes where we’re at
5663,2020-08-12 00:10:59,i7rtif,Dobby doesn’t deserve this
5664,2020-08-12 00:14:18,i7rtif,Can we chip in to smuggle in some cocaine and strippers into the bubble for them? Maybe that'll cheer them up and make them show some actual life.
5665,2020-08-11 23:10:29,i7rtif,"I see Sekera has been attending the Cody Ceci school of shooting, lol"
5666,2020-08-11 23:43:04,i7rtif,This period should be called - how much can Miro carry this period by
5667,2020-08-11 13:57:27,i7rtif,I am just happy I have a series to be afraid to lose right now!
5668,2020-08-11 14:45:13,i7rtif,I look forward to the proceeding developments.
5669,2020-08-11 15:51:19,i7rtif,ITS HERE BABY! PLAYOFF HOCKEY IN DALLAS! ...wait
5670,2020-08-11 15:58:48,i7rtif,"The Flames looked good against the Jets, though Winnipeg had a lot of injuries to deal with. This is a winnable series but it's going to be a battle.

I live close to Calgary so I'm realllllly hoping we do well so I can trash talk a few friends haha.

Let's Go Stars! Benn with the GWG tonight."
5671,2020-08-11 18:14:50,i7rtif,hockey
5672,2020-08-11 18:34:03,i7rtif,Now I’m genuinely curious on how they’ll play now that Round Robin is over. I’ve been telling myself they’ve been taking it easy and not trying as hard.
5673,2020-08-11 20:08:17,i7rtif,"It’s playoff time babay! Feels so weird its just happening at 430 on a Tuesday afternoon in August. 

I know our boys were just reeling it in and saving their energy for the big push. Miro Jersey On = Good Game from our boys."

5684,2020-08-11 21:52:52,i7rtif,clear please? without a mid-ice turnover?????
5685,2020-08-11 21:52:57,i7rtif,"Hey Perry, you have permission to knock the fuck out of tkachuk specifically, thanks."
5686,2020-08-11 21:53:29,i7rtif,Replace Sekera with traffic cone. Upgrade.
5687,2020-08-11 21:54:05,i7rtif,"There really isn't much worse in life than knowing Razor is providing color commentary for a Stars game, but having to listen to Pierre McGuire."
5688,2020-08-11 21:54:43,i7rtif,Miro with the nice one T

5698,2020-08-11 22:02:12,i7rtif,Oh boy did they mess up... down by one and a fired up Rads
5699,2020-08-11 22:02:40,i7rtif,"Rads is my favorite player, but I would like to see how many power play goals against come off of a Rads penalty."
5700,2020-08-11 22:02:42,i7rtif,I believe Dube was picked with the 2nd round pick that Dallas gave them for Kris Russell.
5701,2020-08-11 22:04:26,i7rtif,I am greatly displeased
5702,2020-08-11 22:04:53,i7rtif,LFG PERRY

5730,2020-08-11 22:20:27,i7rtif,So like can we stop him or not? He's had almost 3 goals and almost killed Dicky.

5735,2020-08-11 22:26:48,i7rtif,"Literally never even heard of Dube and he's looking like a phenom out there. This is a series and we have time, but that 1st period didn't instill confidence. Sloppy passing, giveaways, every shot is blocked, and we force passes when there's actually an opening to shoot. 

Frustrating but I think they'll figure things out in the 2nd."

5760,2020-08-11 23:08:17,i7rtif,Sling TV sucks. I have nothing but problems with it freezing. And it sucks especially when there are games on. Like when it just froze during the third Calgary goal. Fucking a
5761,2020-08-11 23:09:57,i7rtif,Why is Sekera back out there??! And then he fires the puck 3 feet wide
5762,2020-08-11 23:10:28,i7rtif,"let's hope we bring that energy into the third, sucks that they got another but we look good"
5763,2020-08-11 23:11:44,i7rtif,I think we can just call him Sukera now right?
5764,2020-08-11 23:16:35,i7rtif,What's going on with Hintz? Looks like hes playing hard but he has also fanned on it seems like over half his shots since the restart.
5765,2020-08-11 23:35:26,i7rtif,"Wait, what happened to Johns!?"
5766,2020-08-11 23:37:03,i7rtif,Johns please be okay :/

5768,2020-08-11 23:39:34,i7rtif,Did Radulov just have a stroke?
5769,2020-08-11 23:39:49,i7rtif,Refs helped us out for ONCE. 3 on 1. FUCK!!!!!! PASS SHOOT. DO SOMETHING
5770,2020-08-11 23:41:10,i7rtif,Seems like Bowness is limiting Sekera’s ice time
5771,2020-08-11 23:49:32,i7rtif,Glad Dicky wasn't seriously hurt.
5772,2020-08-11 23:50:38,i7rtif,I actually made noise. Did you?

6048,2020-08-12 00:09:17,i7rtif,"Damn, that was a good play"
6049,2020-08-12 00:09:50,i7rtif,"Watching our man advantage play makes me want to replace them all with AHL players and see who performs better.

6 on 4 and we look like it's even strength. Fucking pure degeneracy."
6050,2020-08-12 00:10:09,i7rtif,Fuck my ass
6051,2020-08-11 22:00:54,i7rtif,I am displeased by the latest development.
6052,2020-08-11 22:07:47,i7rtif,Guys I’m tired of looking at bowness
6053,2020-08-11 22:09:28,i7rtif,Eat a dick Dube!
6054,2020-08-11 23:11:10,i7rtif,"I was joking before but now, it really is genuinely possible that this game ends before the Tampa/Colombus game lmao."
6055,2020-08-11 23:12:04,i7rtif,"I think overall, despite the score line, the team has looked pretty good"
6056,2020-08-11 21:59:58,i7rtif,Rads is a liability. Been saying it all year.
6057,2020-08-11 22:02:00,i7rtif,Rads please don't fuck us completely lol
6058,2020-08-11 22:19:43,i7rtif,Dube is this year’s Rocco Grimaldi
6059,2020-08-11 23:41:38,i7rtif,You know Stars are playing pretty well. I respek that
6060,2020-08-11 13:41:25,i7rtif,"If Bishop can go, he must. You have to start your #1 goalie in game one. However, I don't want to risk his groin being hurt worse if he isn't 90-95% healthy or better."
6061,2020-08-11 16:34:55,i7rtif,"Well, here we go, boys!"
6062,2020-08-11 16:42:27,i7rtif,"PLAYOFF HOCKEY, BOYS"
6063,2020-08-11 19:03:31,i7rtif,Go Stars!
6064,2020-08-11 19:41:49,i7rtif,What's the source for Dobby starting? I haven't found lineups anywhere but NHL.com predicted Bishop to start
6065,2020-08-11 20:40:50,i7rtif,"Not seeing anything saying Seguin or Bishop are still out, anyone have a source on that? Last I saw, Bowness was saying Seguin was good to go?"
6066,2020-08-11 20:49:30,i7rtif,"These are placeholders from Blues game people, chill out. No info on who's starting yet."
6067,2020-08-11 20:51:33,i7rtif,"I only have one beer left for this game, when should I crack it?"
6068,2020-08-11 21:18:26,i7rtif,Wearing my Stars blanket as a cape. I'm ready!
6069,2020-08-11 21:27:14,i7rtif,ITS TIME!!!!!!! GO STARS!!!!!!!
6070,2020-08-11 21:30:10,i7rtif,Let's fucking goooo.
6071,2020-08-11 21:30:55,i7rtif,Playoff hockey mode engaged
6072,2020-08-11 21:35:03,i7rtif,FSSW has a travel show on and NBCSN still has the Jackets and Lightning game on
6073,2020-08-11 21:39:25,i7rtif,My hope is that Bish is healthy for the second game of the back to back at this point.
6074,2020-08-11 21:41:44,i7rtif,Tampa and the Blue jackets are going to OT
6075,2020-08-11 21:42:01,i7rtif,"Whew, just barely got my drink mixed up in time. Let's do this thing."
6076,2020-08-11 21:44:42,i7rtif,Rocking the 1999 Hull #22 today for some good juju. I feel good. This will end well today.
6077,2020-08-11 21:45:36,i7rtif,I am not going to be productive for the last 45 minutes of work...
6078,2020-08-11 21:46:01,i7rtif,Can someone make gifs of the players doing smelling salts?
6079,2020-08-11 21:46:24,i7rtif,Is it just me or do we get a shot of Tyler Seguin on the smelling salts every single game??
6080,2020-08-11 21:46:27,i7rtif,I want like 35 shots today.
6081,2020-08-11 21:47:55,i7rtif,Is anyone’s NBCSN skipping?
6082,2020-08-11 21:48:06,i7rtif,"#LFG!!!

6083,2020-08-11 21:49:48,i7rtif,Skating looks good for both teams.
6084,2020-08-11 21:49:52,i7rtif,Encouraging start.
6085,2020-08-11 21:50:09,i7rtif,Perry our with Seguin. I’m already annoyed
6086,2020-08-11 21:50:10,i7rtif,"Are they not showing SOG?

6093,2020-08-11 21:53:33,i7rtif,why did dobby get the start?
6094,2020-08-11 21:54:08,i7rtif,Bowness must've told the bench we were controlling the puck for too long in the offensive zone.
6095,2020-08-11 21:55:08,i7rtif,Why do I have to like BOTH of these teams...
6096,2020-08-11 21:56:31,i7rtif,"Coming out with a lot of energy this game compared to the last 3, nice to see so far"
6097,2020-08-11 21:56:33,i7rtif,"I love how they have the Calgary gooseegg ""0"" in Colorado colors.....that's the future, biatch"
6098,2020-08-11 21:58:00,i7rtif,Why can't I watch the stars game. Why do I have to wait for the the bolts game to end.
6099,2020-08-11 21:58:48,i7rtif,Fuck me
6100,2020-08-11 21:58:53,i7rtif,Fuckkkkkkk

6102,2020-08-11 21:59:04,i7rtif,"Thanks, Rads"
6103,2020-08-11 21:59:06,i7rtif,That was a terrible penalty
6104,2020-08-11 21:59:17,i7rtif,That’s not a smart play by Rads...
6105,2020-08-11 21:59:23,i7rtif,KILL KILL KILL
6106,2020-08-11 21:59:26,i7rtif,Rads us such a liability right now

6110,2020-08-11 22:02:02,i7rtif,And so it begins...
6111,2020-08-11 22:02:47,i7rtif,Waiting on hold with Spectrum. Maybe I can get some Damn answers.
6112,2020-08-11 22:03:59,i7rtif,Sad
6113,2020-08-11 22:04:53,i7rtif,Fight!

6115,2020-08-11 22:10:47,i7rtif,That was a great block and clear. F.
6116,2020-08-11 22:14:53,i7rtif,Also I HATE our zone entry on the pp. it’s so chaotic
6117,2020-08-11 22:17:16,i7rtif,Thank God Dobby
6118,2020-08-11 22:17:54,i7rtif,FFS

6123,2020-08-11 22:33:32,i7rtif,"I love reporters asking questions like they player is just going to snap on everyone on his team.

I guess that’s what the fans want to see, but you’re never seeing that so stop asking."
6124,2020-08-11 22:43:42,i7rtif,What the hell was that Comeau?
6125,2020-08-11 22:45:56,i7rtif,"Anyone trying to watch on Spectrum have an issue where it says Stars are playing, but Lightning’s game is on??"
6126,2020-08-11 22:47:43,i7rtif,Benn looks like he just doesn't give a shit.
6127,2020-08-11 22:48:49,i7rtif,DOOKIE POOPS! Just 100% DOOKIE POOPS
6128,2020-08-11 22:49:51,i7rtif,"I love Segs & Benn as people but if these guys are the best offensive players on your team, your team isn't good."

6130,2020-08-11 22:52:42,i7rtif,And that wasn't interference?
6131,2020-08-11 22:52:57,i7rtif,Come on boys I just want to open my beer

6144,2020-08-11 22:54:47,i7rtif,Holy fuck! We did. We fucking did it. I am honestly super surprised.
6145,2020-08-11 22:54:59,i7rtif,Guri!  Nice shift by Janmark there too
6146,2020-08-11 22:55:07,i7rtif,Pavs?

6171,2020-08-11 22:56:31,i7rtif,I think we've unearthed a vintage Cam Talbot.
6172,2020-08-11 22:56:32,i7rtif,KNUCKLE PUCK
6173,2020-08-11 22:56:40,i7rtif,Yes we’ve been bad BUT we’ve had zero puck luck until now.
6174,2020-08-11 22:56:49,i7rtif,OKAY AM I WATCHING THE RIGHT STARS
6175,2020-08-11 22:56:50,i7rtif,The ol' Dallas 1-2 combo!
6176,2020-08-11 22:56:50,i7rtif,I liked benn just messing with their dman
6177,2020-08-11 22:56:51,i7rtif,You're fucking kidding me! My guitar can't take all this Pantera play!
6178,2020-08-11 22:56:52,i7rtif,Who ever that changed from a red shirt to green. THANK YOU
6179,2020-08-11 22:57:43,i7rtif,I go watch the Mavs for five minutes and this happens.
6180,2020-08-11 23:01:46,i7rtif,That's one of the weakest goals I have ever seen but I'll take it!
6181,2020-08-11 23:04:57,i7rtif,Damnit
6182,2020-08-11 23:05:26,i7rtif,I am shocked that Sekera was on the ice again. Shocked.
6183,2020-08-11 23:05:27,i7rtif,Well ain't that a kick in the junk.
6184,2020-08-11 23:06:09,i7rtif,Is it just me or should the away team not have the luxury of having their goal song played? I get it they're at a neutral site with no fans but there's a home and away team lol
6185,2020-08-11 23:06:32,i7rtif,I like that the playoff pack includes a DEFEND BIG D shirt
6186,2020-08-11 23:06:59,i7rtif,Can't even really be mad. Our first goal was a complete accident and the second was just Talbot having a brain fart.
6187,2020-08-11 23:35:37,i7rtif,I am sad yet excited for a new coach and changes in our team. In order to do that we have to lose though I guess... I'm very conflicted
6188,2020-08-11 23:36:12,i7rtif,So we're getting out hit by these guys? For real? Wth.
6189,2020-08-11 23:38:04,i7rtif,Is Calgary turtling?
6190,2020-08-11 23:38:20,i7rtif,How many of our bank passes the refs gonna get between?
6191,2020-08-11 23:39:25,i7rtif,Ref just took out a flames player
6192,2020-08-11 23:39:26,i7rtif,Fuck. Rads. So close.
6193,2020-08-11 23:39:39,i7rtif,-_-
6194,2020-08-11 23:59:05,i7rtif,Anyone else getting awful coverage on fssw+?
6195,2020-08-12 00:00:28,i7rtif,"I think one of our big issues is the fact that our defensemen will not exit the defensive zone or enter the offensive zone with possession. We might not have the defensemen to do it really but this means that we resort to passing the puck to a forward who gets sealed off and must dump and chase, I could be totally wrong though, normally I am"
6196,2020-08-12 00:00:37,i7rtif,still mad Miro wasn’t nominated for the Calder
6197,2020-08-12 00:03:56,i7rtif,I know we are down but we are sooooooooooo impatient with the puck.
6198,2020-08-12 00:06:11,i7rtif,DUMP AND CHASE EVERYONE DRINK
6199,2020-08-12 00:06:16,i7rtif,Dobby is all of us
6200,2020-08-12 00:06:19,i7rtif,God we are so bad lmao
6201,2020-08-12 00:06:25,i7rtif,This is just. Ughhhh. What the FUCK are we doing
6202,2020-08-12 00:06:35,i7rtif,The Flames are all over the stars in the neutral zone....
6203,2020-08-12 00:06:44,i7rtif,This is fucking pathetic.
6204,2020-08-12 00:07:30,i7rtif,C’mon. They’re scared. Please tie
6205,2020-08-12 00:07:34,i7rtif,Capitalize on this shit!
6206,2020-08-12 00:07:39,i7rtif,"Nill, that mask doesn't prevent bad coaching..."
6207,2020-08-12 00:08:08,i7rtif,Bowness runs the old school don’t pull goalie until a minute left.
6208,2020-08-12 00:09:34,i7rtif,Fuck
6209,2020-08-12 00:09:38,i7rtif,why does it seem like nobodys playing with any urgency
6210,2020-08-12 00:10:29,i7rtif,Fuck you ugly ass coat.
6211,2020-08-12 00:10:59,i7rtif,I’m changing my name and moving to Seattle. I’m now Prafessor Wurland.
6212,2020-08-12 00:11:08,i7rtif,I have confidence in our team.
6213,2020-08-12 00:11:51,i7rtif,We looked better than we did against St. Louis.
6214,2020-08-12 00:13:31,i7rtif,At least I can finally leave the bathroom
6215,2020-08-11 23:11:11,i7rtif,"If you aren't local, you just flat out won't see this game. TB-CBJ in 3OT."
6216,2020-08-11 22:00:54,i7rtif,Why can we never start with a lead
6217,2020-08-11 22:01:30,i7rtif,Fucking Radulov
6218,2020-08-11 22:02:02,i7rtif,Rads need to chill
6219,2020-08-11 22:02:15,i7rtif,"Rads, don't fucking start this shit when you just cost us a goal"
6220,2020-08-11 22:18:37,i7rtif,We look like we just don’t care.. also sekera sucks
6221,2020-08-11 23:11:10,i7rtif,need 3 goals gogogo
6222,2020-08-11 23:49:06,i7rtif,Hello.  I would like a Seth Jones please.  How do we do that? Dude is AMAZING
6223,2020-08-11 23:58:24,i7rtif,"We are playing quality defend-the-lead hockey, except we're behind by 1."
6224,2020-08-11 22:14:57,i7rtif,I feel like I am watching a diff game from y'all. We have played well.
6225,2020-08-11 22:13:13,i7rtif,"Dude Klinger does not think. Dude dumps shit in that shouldn’t be. Takes wild ass shots. Idk man, I’m happy we have the guy but what happened to that awareness we saw those first couple years."
6226,2020-08-11 15:58:00,i7rtif,Let's get Sekera's ice time down to about 2:30 TOI for this whole series. Thanks hockey gods.
6227,2020-08-11 17:20:13,i7rtif,"Nervous but I’m ready for this shit, start of strong boys!"
6228,2020-08-11 18:33:36,i7rtif,"Well if it makes anyone feel better I decided to play this matchup in Chel last night. I figured it was fair for me to play as Dallas because I also can’t score to save my life and take a lot of penalties. 

Quick recap: Calgary blasted out of the gate with a 3-0 lead at first intermission while Dallas couldn’t stay out of their own zone. 

Got a lucky zero angle goal in the 2nd which shifted momentum. By the end of the 2nd it was tied up 3-3. 

Calgary took a boarding penalty about halfway through the 3rd which setup a nasty Seguin 1 timer to take the lead. Then Dallas sat back and let Calgary tie it up with about 3 minutes left. But with 1 minute left to go in OT, Dallas got a 2 on 1 which resulted in the game winning goal (take this with a grain of salt since it was 3v3 OT) 

Anyway, I figured if I can score 5 times on Calgary, so can the real Stars."
6229,2020-08-11 22:00:52,i7rtif,Fuck.
6230,2020-08-11 22:03:52,i7rtif,Time to protect this one goal deficit

6236,2020-08-11 16:54:16,i7rtif,"If those are the actual lines, I might switch Kivi and Janmark up and put the FCC line as line 3 rather than 4. 

Or have Janmark center linne 3 with Dickinson at wing. I dunno. Hard choice."

6316,2020-08-11 23:04:08,i7rtif,"A theory:

A team like Calgary feeds off an emotional game. You let them blow their wad the first period, weather the storm, and they're spent by the time the 2nd intermission arrives. Turning a hockey game into a fist fight is tiring yo."

6399,2020-08-11 23:04:56,i7rtif,That should have been saved

6403,2020-08-11 21:16:33,i7rtif,!Tkachuk
6404,2020-08-11 21:30:04,i7rtif,Is the game available to listen to on the NHL app?
6405,2020-08-11 21:39:24,i7rtif,So is bishop in or out?
6406,2020-08-11 21:44:29,i7rtif,Casual fan here what are our expectations for this series and the playoffs overall?
6407,2020-08-11 21:45:31,i7rtif,Unleash Playoff Bowness!!!!!

6416,2020-08-11 22:51:49,i7rtif,Why does Sekera ice it all the time? Guess that’s why he’s on the penalty kill.
6417,2020-08-11 22:52:50,i7rtif,Good to see Dicky back in after that should have been major
6418,2020-08-11 22:54:04,i7rtif,Guriiiiii

6431,2020-08-11 23:31:05,i7rtif,"Yes, I want to see more of Roope too!"
6432,2020-08-11 23:31:05,i7rtif,So I’ve been at work what’s going on what’s this multiple goals shit who are these people
6433,2020-08-11 23:39:18,i7rtif,So close!
6434,2020-08-11 23:39:24,i7rtif,GAHHHHH
6435,2020-08-11 23:55:19,i7rtif,Flames HC looks like a villain from a Spider Man movie
6436,2020-08-12 00:02:25,i7rtif,Where would we be without miro
6437,2020-08-12 00:03:18,i7rtif,Getting messy and clumsy again

6447,2020-08-12 00:09:27,i7rtif,How about we try something new on the PP? Is this fucking 1997 or what?
6448,2020-08-12 00:09:36,i7rtif,:(
6449,2020-08-12 00:10:01,i7rtif,"Oh well, we tried."
6450,2020-08-12 00:10:05,i7rtif,"Pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, pass. Pathetic."
6451,2020-08-12 00:10:42,i7rtif,Fucking pitiful
6452,2020-08-11 22:42:18,i7rtif,"Nice shot, Sekera..."
6453,2020-08-11 20:26:21,i7rtif,So Seguin still isn't playing tonight? Damn.
6454,2020-08-11 22:18:25,i7rtif,Going to watch Tampa vs cbj OT
6455,2020-08-11 22:18:31,i7rtif,Johns gets credit for that goal
6456,2020-08-11 22:22:50,i7rtif,Can we agree to start the game down 2 goals just to skip all this
6457,2020-08-11 22:50:27,i7rtif,/u/Pizza_73 How we lookin' now?
6458,2020-08-11 22:55:18,i7rtif,JAMIE!!! RIGHT BACK INTO IT LET’S GOOOOOOO
6459,2020-08-11 23:02:26,i7rtif,Fuck this country music they’ve been playing
6460,2020-08-11 23:05:12,i7rtif,How do you not save that? Weak.
6461,2020-08-11 23:05:55,i7rtif,"I fuckin said this last game, top shelf can’t be that easily accessible. WHY DIDNT MOM PUT AWAY THE STEP STOOL"
6462,2020-08-11 23:26:14,i7rtif,Watching the third from the pool!
6463,2020-08-11 23:29:40,i7rtif,"Oof. Yeah, I'm mot sure. I asked my liquor store guy for some and he was able to get it in Oklahoma. Now I'm in Georgia and haven't seen it here. 

It's different because it's in the north. I'm weird and love all things Caithness, even Pulteney haha."
6464,2020-08-11 23:39:40,i7rtif,god that was a beautiful opportunity
6465,2020-08-11 23:55:46,i7rtif,Bang bang

6471,2020-08-11 23:04:32,i7rtif,Typical.
6472,2020-08-11 23:05:34,i7rtif,"Damn, hockey is heartbreaking.  Let’s fucking turtle into a shell and be mad at the Flames."
6473,2020-08-11 23:32:39,i7rtif,A penalty in triple ot? Fuck off.
6474,2020-08-11 23:39:38,i7rtif,Aaaaand Radulov is still worthless
6475,2020-08-11 23:39:38,i7rtif,SHOOT IT YOU STUPID FUCK
6476,2020-08-11 22:15:05,i7rtif,"Dobby is fucking good. 

Pay him, trade Bish."
6477,2020-08-12 00:09:40,i7rtif,fuck this team I'm done with this shit we don't care at all

6480,2020-08-11 22:03:35,i7rtif,Welp. That’s game - back it up boys
6481,2020-08-11 22:11:04,i7rtif,we suck
6482,2020-08-11 15:29:00,i7rtif,Thanks for the nice words. Good luck out there!
6483,2020-08-11 16:56:54,i7rtif, Perry/Tkachuk is going to be spicy. I would also settle for Oleksiak/Tkachuk.
6484,2020-08-11 15:47:30,i7rtif,"AHHHHHHHHHHH 

FUCK NEGATIVITY AND LOWER CASE WORDS!!!"
6485,2020-08-11 17:24:49,i7rtif,HAIL THE MOOTERUS
6486,2020-08-11 17:51:49,i7rtif,LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!
6487,2020-08-11 22:26:49,i7rtif,manifesting this
6488,2020-08-11 23:42:27,i7rtif,And the Cowboys quarterback
6489,2020-08-11 23:43:40,i7rtif,Heard he's in the Rangers BP right now.
6490,2020-08-11 23:43:06,i7rtif,I heard he’s playing SG too so the Mavs are going to be playing with four whenever he’s on the court
6491,2020-08-11 23:44:02,i7rtif,Move him to SG. Luka at point.
6492,2020-08-11 18:45:47,i7rtif,Yay FSSW   Boo NBC
6493,2020-08-11 21:56:28,i7rtif,I love it!
6494,2020-08-11 21:57:50,i7rtif,The messiah
6495,2020-08-11 22:01:27,i7rtif,Hehehe our secret weapon
6496,2020-08-11 15:20:27,i7rtif,That iguana brings a lunchpail to work. I like it.
6497,2020-08-11 19:17:44,i7rtif,I thought there was one long iguana but there’s actually two!!!
6498,2020-08-11 16:28:11,i7rtif,God i hope so hahaha
6499,2020-08-11 20:03:09,i7rtif,I was wondering last game if Bishop and Segiun were really just being rested.
6500,2020-08-11 22:27:27,i7rtif,"I get we needed to fill a spot for Johns at the time, but I do not and will not ever get this organizations obsession with playing a 7-8 Dman over a top tier AHL Dman. I’d much rather have Fedun out there. Hanley. Heatherington. One of those neon signs in the shape of a turtle that say “slow down, children playing”"
6501,2020-08-11 22:28:02,i7rtif,Both goals should’ve been stopped before a scoring chance even happened. Dicky can’t get caught deep and get beat while Janmark is already F1. The other goal is clearly on Sekera. I’ll give you a pass if McDavid walks you...not a third liner with 6 regular season goals. Just some sloppy ass hockey.
6502,2020-08-11 22:32:17,i7rtif,"If Tkachuck took that hit the way Dicky did there would've been no call. He sold it and it paid off. Likewise if Dicky sold that crosscheck it would've been a major. 

I'd rather play with honor win or lose. Flopping makes me sick. 

Second period team LETS FUCKING GO!"
6503,2020-08-11 22:16:11,i7rtif,TKAFUK TKACHUK!
6504,2020-08-11 22:16:05,i7rtif,FUCK THE REFS!
6505,2020-08-11 22:58:24,i7rtif,lol
6506,2020-08-11 22:59:11,i7rtif,As is life!
6507,2020-08-11 23:07:27,i7rtif,Can we just fire him?
6508,2020-08-11 23:12:19,i7rtif,I mean he kinda did. It’s like when you put your two week notice in. You’re there but you’re not.
6509,2020-08-11 22:00:11,i7rtif,I mean... not wrong
6510,2020-08-11 22:24:47,i7rtif,The stench keeps anyone from checking him
6511,2020-08-11 23:07:10,i7rtif,**CUT*SEKERA**
6512,2020-08-11 15:44:38,i7rtif,Amoo.
6513,2020-08-11 22:26:51,i7rtif,Sekera sucks so bad that Benn forgets he’s on the team
6514,2020-08-11 22:25:24,i7rtif,What do you mean?  It’s not like scoring more than the other team is important.
6515,2020-08-11 22:45:50,i7rtif,It’s amazing how much progress he made as a player after he left our team.
6516,2020-08-11 23:16:13,i7rtif,I swear Bowness got a boner for him or something
6517,2020-08-11 23:17:15,i7rtif,If we’re going to give up goals why not let the rookie learn from the mistakes. His only “horrible” choices during his game was due to positioning.
6518,2020-08-11 14:48:21,i7rtif,This is going to be a good series C-Man. Hope you have your popcorn and Dr. Pepper on standby
6519,2020-08-11 21:31:06,i7rtif,Cheers from Nashville stars bro!
6520,2020-08-11 21:57:02,i7rtif,"Yeah, wish someone would teach sekura how to hit, he's getting tossed around out there"
6521,2020-08-11 22:14:41,i7rtif,Roll him up a Dube.
6522,2020-08-11 22:29:06,i7rtif,"It's a nice way of saying ""bad"""
6523,2020-08-11 22:29:24,i7rtif,It’s a nice way of saying we don’t score good
6524,2020-08-11 22:30:11,i7rtif,*Sometimes?*
6525,2020-08-11 22:32:55,i7rtif,Allowed the first goal in 9 straight games
6526,2020-08-11 22:43:48,i7rtif,Seriously. Set it up and shoot.
6527,2020-08-11 22:46:00,i7rtif,My roommate who doesn't watch hockey noticed it in literally 2 minutes
6528,2020-08-11 23:09:58,i7rtif,It’s because he got EXPERIENCE or something idk anymore
6529,2020-08-11 23:09:58,i7rtif,Fedun:
6530,2020-08-11 23:12:56,i7rtif,"Ideal D-pairs

Esa - Klinger 

Miro - Johns

Oleksiak - Fedun/Harley

Sekera - shipped to the middle of nowhere."
6531,2020-08-11 23:11:26,i7rtif,The Rick Carlisle special
6532,2020-08-11 23:12:18,i7rtif,Sekera a boomer confirmed
6533,2020-08-11 23:19:11,i7rtif,I'll definitely take that period.
6534,2020-08-11 23:35:58,i7rtif,"He's really dialed in, he started pretty sloppy"
6535,2020-08-11 23:41:33,i7rtif,Oh jesus I didn't even think of that!
6536,2020-08-11 15:29:25,i7rtif,you down for goal donation today?
6537,2020-08-11 21:51:11,i7rtif,We're two deep and it's still 0-0. What the what?
6538,2020-08-11 22:03:12,i7rtif,Yeah. Almost like Rads didn't touch Tkafuck at all
6539,2020-08-11 22:03:35,i7rtif,"Yeah seriously Tkachuk skated into Rads and threw his arms up like he got shot, it was such a weak call"
6540,2020-08-11 22:03:49,i7rtif,was a super weak call but now he's angry and trying to start shit
6541,2020-08-11 22:03:27,i7rtif,Because we are sick of him taking stupid penalties. Mr. 2 minute minor.
6542,2020-08-11 22:10:13,i7rtif,"This made me giggle out loud.

MIRP!"
6543,2020-08-11 22:14:05,i7rtif,/hits blunt
6544,2020-08-11 22:21:58,i7rtif,We are a defensive team. Don’t forget that!
6545,2020-08-11 22:23:58,i7rtif,That's mean to cones.
6546,2020-08-11 22:35:37,i7rtif,Sacrifice your liver for the greater good.
6547,2020-08-11 22:41:29,i7rtif,We need to turn you into an alcoholic /s
6548,2020-08-11 22:39:23,i7rtif,"I just made myself an adult beverage, I'm right there with ya. We will sacrifice our livers for the W!"
6549,2020-08-11 22:39:58,i7rtif,Our beer drinking helped the boys rally against the boos on Sunday.
6550,2020-08-11 22:45:39,i7rtif,Yes! We did it against the blues and won! Let's crack it open! What are you drinking??
6551,2020-08-11 22:47:31,i7rtif,Muh playoff beard
6552,2020-08-11 23:00:33,i7rtif,Thank you for your sacrifice.
6553,2020-08-11 23:02:31,i7rtif,I respect you for doing so. Thank you sir
6554,2020-08-11 23:00:09,i7rtif,"I dont care who scores, as long as they're wearing green. FUCK IT, CREDIT THE GOAL TO DOBBY"
6555,2020-08-11 23:01:05,i7rtif,I think it will credited to Rads with Benn as the primary assist
6556,2020-08-11 23:07:35,i7rtif,Who else goes in though?
6557,2020-08-11 23:41:07,i7rtif,please report comments like this. just did a scan and didn't see any but we would remove it.
6558,2020-08-11 23:46:49,i7rtif,I missed it. What happened?
6559,2020-08-12 00:13:22,i7rtif,You could see dobbys frustration at all the squandering before the power play too.
6560,2020-08-12 00:12:57,i7rtif,"Kept looking for the 'perfect' shot. Just slap shit and see what happen, jesus christ we got two more players to get the rebound."
6561,2020-08-12 12:53:44,i7rtif,"Almost like the have zero chemistry and no confidence because of it....Wonder why that is. On a completely separate topic, I wonder what the lines will be next game."
6562,2020-08-11 18:44:42,i7rtif,"To be fair, that’s 99% of hockey interviews haha. Pucks in deep, cycle, play your game, get in high scoring areas and good things will happen"
6563,2020-08-11 18:53:51,i7rtif,I’d let jamie get pucks deep in my zone
6564,2020-08-11 21:39:02,i7rtif,"Like, on a date?"
6565,2020-08-11 21:43:20,i7rtif,!tkachuk
6566,2020-08-11 21:56:26,i7rtif,Best line we have
6567,2020-08-11 22:05:54,i7rtif,Josh trying to fill the void by calling shots was pretty amusing.
6568,2020-08-11 22:22:32,i7rtif,Lol this is the first thing that made me smile from the last 20 minutes
6569,2020-08-11 22:23:11,i7rtif,"It should have been a 5 and a game. If it were a stars player that had done what dubè did, it would have been."
6570,2020-08-11 22:21:01,i7rtif,You mean from before lockdown.
6571,2020-08-11 22:23:11,i7rtif,But this time it was MORE than 5 minutes before the first goal!
6572,2020-08-11 22:22:49,i7rtif,I certainly hope so
6573,2020-08-11 22:24:11,i7rtif,Fedun is injured.
6574,2020-08-11 22:24:10,i7rtif,i've never been the worlds biggest fedun fan but i'd pretty much give up an arm to have him over sekera
6575,2020-08-11 22:23:55,i7rtif,The reason to play him is he’s a vet and Bowness is bad at coaching.
6576,2020-08-11 22:29:49,i7rtif,Meanwhile Bowness “Imma play Sekera 10 minutes”
6577,2020-08-11 22:36:58,i7rtif,Thank goodness it’s a one year contract
6578,2020-08-11 22:57:24,i7rtif,IM DRUNK
6579,2020-08-11 22:59:30,i7rtif,About that time!!
6580,2020-08-11 23:14:24,i7rtif,You're on the wrong channel. It's on like FSSW+
6581,2020-08-11 23:26:06,i7rtif,Tarps off boys!!!
6582,2020-08-11 23:18:13,i7rtif,I'm at work though.
6583,2020-08-11 23:44:43,i7rtif,4 goals on 115 shots
6584,2020-08-11 23:48:01,i7rtif,After four goals in 60 minutes :/
6585,2020-08-11 23:52:48,i7rtif,I switch over to it every so often. The goalies are making some impressive saves + Torts replaces all his players’ bones with steel so they can block shots
6586,2020-08-11 23:51:00,i7rtif,That would’ve been on klingman tho
6587,2020-08-12 00:02:18,i7rtif,"And also Been, Seggy, and Radulovs just for the shame factort."
6588,2020-08-12 00:04:35,i7rtif,The team's sweat turns into chocolate milk.
6589,2020-08-11 23:01:12,i7rtif,I like to describe it as soccer but where things actually happen
6590,2020-08-11 23:01:04,i7rtif,Ice hockey is very good
6591,2020-08-11 23:08:29,i7rtif,"It's also not elegant whatsoever. That's what I really like about it. It's ugly, rough and nothing ever goes as planned."
6592,2020-08-11 23:00:40,i7rtif,"I know you're new so you're gonna get this friendly advice, don't compare hockey and soccer, we don't want to be compared to those um, how do i say this nicely... haha"
6593,2020-08-11 21:34:15,i7rtif,Bruh
6594,2020-08-11 21:38:33,i7rtif,"Same boat here. Except mine is official, our contract is getting pulled, last day of work is September 1st..."
6595,2020-08-11 21:40:49,i7rtif,Damn dude that sucks. Hopefully the Stars give you something to be cheerful about today
6596,2020-08-11 21:38:40,i7rtif,"I'm not gay but I want to live in a log cabin in the woods with Jamie Benn. We won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand in the kitchen window watching him tighten his ass as he chops wood, shirtless, sweat pouring off his body. I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Jamie. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then he'll go inside, pen a brief missive to his departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without his one true platonic love"
6597,2020-08-11 21:57:46,i7rtif,"Which I'm totally fine with.

This is the time!"
6598,2020-08-11 21:56:26,i7rtif,me too!
6599,2020-08-11 22:19:53,i7rtif,Ugh. Fr
6600,2020-08-11 22:21:00,i7rtif,Much rather had Polak over Sekera
6601,2020-08-11 22:22:54,i7rtif,At least Polak hit people
6602,2020-08-11 22:26:44,i7rtif,"Especially with Dubes on ice, he knows how to beat him."
6603,2020-08-11 22:24:45,i7rtif,Dobby
6604,2020-08-11 22:25:37,i7rtif,Were spending more time in the offensive zone. Just getting beat on breakaways whenever we do it
6605,2020-08-11 22:25:51,i7rtif,We skated well. Rads looked fast. We got a lot of quality long range shots.
6606,2020-08-11 22:28:31,i7rtif,Guri continues to have some looks. I don't think I saw Klinger take one shot during the RRobin and there's been a few from the blue line... So they're taking shots
6607,2020-08-11 22:35:14,i7rtif,Seriously though how hard is it to not shoot directly into someone’s shin pads
6608,2020-08-11 22:30:21,i7rtif,He really doesn’t want to be head coach next year. Or ever.
6609,2020-08-11 22:30:16,i7rtif,He plays Dallas Stars hockey aka he’s slow and disorganized
6610,2020-08-11 22:34:36,i7rtif,"Unfortunately Fedun is unfit to play, so they don't even really have an option outside of him. Maybe the put Hanley in."
6611,2020-08-11 22:46:24,i7rtif,"If I thought anyone's was betting against their team, it would be him."
6612,2020-08-11 22:59:16,i7rtif,[deleted]
6613,2020-08-11 23:01:05,i7rtif,"Taking one for the team there, we appreciate it"
6614,2020-08-11 23:01:06,i7rtif,Do what you need to for the team. I respect you sir
6615,2020-08-11 23:03:45,i7rtif,"I'd like to buy you a drink.

Or 7."
6616,2020-08-11 23:11:28,i7rtif,On the bench mostly it seems
6617,2020-08-11 23:11:26,i7rtif,Flames have been shutting Hintz down like we've been shutting Johnny down
6618,2020-08-11 23:21:35,i7rtif,LOL
6619,2020-08-11 23:28:54,i7rtif,Keep us updated on any magic Luka shows off
6620,2020-08-11 23:29:32,i7rtif,Dope. My go-back button is getting worn out.
6621,2020-08-11 23:34:26,i7rtif,Score three times?
6622,2020-08-11 23:49:39,i7rtif,He must be wounded he’s not even noticeable
6623,2020-08-11 14:45:48,i7rtif,Eh it's long enought to rest IMO and it means I get Stars hockey sooner :)
6624,2020-08-11 15:14:16,i7rtif,If there was momentum building in the win over the !blues then I’m fine with them getting back on the ice right away.
6625,2020-08-11 15:37:40,i7rtif,Look at Columbus though. They had the late game Sunday and the matinee tonight. That really sucks. Especially against the Lightning’s speed.
6626,2020-08-11 15:10:03,i7rtif,They will. Total. For the whole series. :(
6627,2020-08-11 16:14:15,i7rtif,I find it more amusing than crazy
6628,2020-08-11 18:25:17,i7rtif,"I find it even more entertaining that they will both be watching multiple rivals play playoff hockey in their own barns, while they hit the Links"
6629,2020-08-11 17:09:44,i7rtif,"I'm really worried about sweeps in this playoffs. There's no feeling of a change of scenery every two games (in the first 4). I feel like most teams can bounce back in regular playoffs, after a two game slide. In the bubble, every game feels like the same, for better or worse."
6630,2020-08-11 17:58:26,i7rtif,Happened in the NBA too apparently
6631,2020-08-11 18:45:34,i7rtif,isnt the first letter silent in both of those? xD
6632,2020-08-11 18:21:08,i7rtif,"Flames fan lurking your thread... I've never heard that one before, and I love it. Can't believe I haven't, funny chirp bud!  
  
Here's to a good series!"
6633,2020-08-11 21:51:58,i7rtif," Big, if true!"
6634,2020-08-11 21:51:59,i7rtif,Big if true
6635,2020-08-11 21:52:08,i7rtif,Lets hope Bowness knows that
6636,2020-08-11 21:52:16,i7rtif,Booger McFarland is a stars fan?
6637,2020-08-11 21:56:32,i7rtif,Source?
6638,2020-08-11 21:53:39,i7rtif,That was fucking beautiful!  Flat out tossed him like a sack of potatoes
6639,2020-08-11 22:13:27,i7rtif,Just feel like these lines don't work. I really want to see Roope and Denis back on a line together.
6640,2020-08-11 22:17:37,i7rtif,Jesus thank you! I thought I was the only one
6641,2020-08-11 22:19:45,i7rtif,Sekera? Or Dube? Lol
6642,2020-08-11 22:19:59,i7rtif,Ugh. Fr
6643,2020-08-11 22:21:36,i7rtif,Just awful offense. Like no idea what to do in the offensive zone. Just a mess.
6644,2020-08-11 22:20:30,i7rtif,A pylon > Sekera
6645,2020-08-11 22:24:45,i7rtif,Is Benn worried about anything? Has that same empty stare he always does
6646,2020-08-11 22:27:00,i7rtif,They just got away from what was working but there were a lot of good things to build on or some shit.
6647,2020-08-11 22:26:18,i7rtif,Did you not see Sean Shapiro’s twitter post yesterday? Jamie Benn says he’s confident in the guys scoring.
6648,2020-08-11 22:26:10,i7rtif,Can you imagine how bad it would be if our defense ***wasn't*** our strength?
6649,2020-08-11 22:30:26,i7rtif,Sekera was only on the ice for 4:19.  Only players on the ice less was Perry (fight) and Hintz (3:58)
6650,2020-08-11 22:31:17,i7rtif,Definitely
6651,2020-08-11 22:34:00,i7rtif,The problem is they have to come off the ice eventually and then... oof.
6652,2020-08-11 22:36:38,i7rtif,"We need more than that. Sorry. But I'll be the first to admit that Rads, Segs, and Jaime, especially Jaime better step all this shit up (even tho I've defended all of them left/right up til now)....no more excuses from me disguised as ""patience""  .... fuck this. 

The.time.is.now. Stars, act like it"
6653,2020-08-11 22:37:17,i7rtif,You can probably enjoy some Mavs for a week or 2 more.
6654,2020-08-11 22:46:08,i7rtif,Feels like lately it’s been more like 20 minutes a period
6655,2020-08-11 23:00:02,i7rtif,Like celebrity deaths.
6656,2020-08-11 23:01:03,i7rtif,Life is present
6657,2020-08-11 23:07:23,i7rtif,I now have alcohol poisoning
6658,2020-08-12 00:02:25,i7rtif,I love your optimism
6659,2020-08-12 00:04:00,i7rtif,Lol. I think optimistic maybe underselling it
6660,2020-08-11 23:21:41,i7rtif,[deleted]
6661,2020-08-11 23:19:23,i7rtif,[deleted]
6662,2020-08-11 20:21:49,i7rtif,Hell yeah brother
6663,2020-08-11 21:28:38,i7rtif,Cheers mate
6664,2020-08-11 21:35:38,i7rtif,How about the FIRST goal?
6665,2020-08-11 21:44:19,i7rtif,SAME. Let's go!!
6666,2020-08-11 21:57:18,i7rtif,Fuck Lucic
6667,2020-08-11 21:54:44,i7rtif,This is going better than expected so far. Which is a bit sad. Haha
6668,2020-08-11 21:55:51,i7rtif,Nothing new to see here lmao
6669,2020-08-11 22:08:21,i7rtif,Oleksiask gave him a good one earlier
6670,2020-08-11 22:11:02,i7rtif,[deleted]
6671,2020-08-11 22:22:24,i7rtif,"Look in the middle, its the free space."
6672,2020-08-11 22:22:30,i7rtif,"Is it your FREE SPACE?

That's a bingo!"
6673,2020-08-11 22:22:22,i7rtif,Every time Sekera gives away the puck take a shot. You will be drunk in one shift.
6674,2020-08-11 22:25:22,i7rtif,We scored a goal. That’s amazing.
6675,2020-08-11 22:22:00,i7rtif,Any win is a great game for the stars.
6676,2020-08-11 22:25:39,i7rtif,"Bowness, more like Bowl movement. Right?"
6677,2020-08-11 22:23:53,i7rtif,He sucks
6678,2020-08-11 22:39:34,i7rtif,you do realize that's grounds for disciplinary action right?
6679,2020-08-11 22:58:53,i7rtif,"Stay the fuck away bro

Edit: thank you for your sacrifice"
6680,2020-08-11 23:01:51,i7rtif,Keep your eyes glued on the TV. Have somebody fetch you a bedpan if necessary .
6681,2020-08-11 23:06:43,i7rtif,Lazy play
6682,2020-08-11 23:11:37,i7rtif,I think Sekera has forgotten what team he plays for.
6683,2020-08-11 23:33:23,i7rtif,Who did?
6684,2020-08-11 23:31:17,i7rtif,Old Man Bowness don't like the kids.
6685,2020-08-11 23:31:04,i7rtif,Yeah I don’t understand that. At all.
6686,2020-08-11 23:34:00,i7rtif,"These kids did work on both our goals, lets basically sit them.

Bang bang \*sad hockey noises\*"
6687,2020-08-11 23:35:37,i7rtif,Unsubscribe.
6688,2020-08-12 00:00:43,i7rtif,That was me. Then saw on twitter it was streaming on the NBC Sports page and  you can watch live there as long as you have a cable sub. I missed the entire 1st though.
6689,2020-08-11 23:10:56,i7rtif,LOL underrated comment
6690,2020-08-11 23:43:34,i7rtif,Mirp
6691,2020-08-11 19:29:06,i7rtif,hockey?
6692,2020-08-11 21:33:18,i7rtif,websites
6693,2020-08-11 21:34:44,i7rtif,"Puck drop won't be for a minute, hope one wins in regulation"
6694,2020-08-11 21:39:31,i7rtif,They seem to be delaying the stars game?? Not sure.
6695,2020-08-11 21:35:35,i7rtif,Hulu did that to me just now. I changed channel and came back and it fixed it. Weird.
6696,2020-08-11 21:55:58,i7rtif,Mirp
6697,2020-08-11 22:03:50,i7rtif,Mr. 2 minute minor himself.
6698,2020-08-11 22:03:41,i7rtif,I swear all of his penalties are +100’ away from our own net too. So annoying
6699,2020-08-11 22:07:30,i7rtif,Yeah its true. Drafted 56th ovr
6700,2020-08-11 22:04:42,i7rtif,yikes if true
6701,2020-08-11 22:16:30,i7rtif,He was drafted using the conditional 2nd round draft pick that Dallas traded as a part of the Russell deal
6702,2020-08-11 22:23:19,i7rtif,"That would be WAY better, and we know they have extra sticks already. Win win. F, take Sekera's stick and chuck it out there when he's supposed to be on the ice."
6703,2020-08-11 22:35:28,i7rtif,I would give anything for Dirk’s passion from our Captain.
6704,2020-08-11 22:49:06,i7rtif,It’s like we don’t even try to get into high percentage scoring areas. It’s just throwing it at the net and hoping for the best.
6705,2020-08-11 22:51:19,i7rtif,"Yeah, the shots on goal are 14-13 right now, but it doesn't feel that way. DAL hasn't had many decent ones."
6706,2020-08-11 22:56:24,i7rtif,ANOTHER ONE
6707,2020-08-11 22:58:40,i7rtif,This! Talbot is average at best.
6708,2020-08-11 23:06:51,i7rtif,"I'm betting Sekera is threatening to leave if he doesn't get ice time... And we're listening for some stupid reason. 

Should've been Sekera that left, not Polak"
6709,2020-08-11 23:17:22,i7rtif,Yeah something seems off with him
6710,2020-08-11 23:17:48,i7rtif,Maybe he’s trying too hard and fanning bc of it?
6711,2020-08-11 23:18:24,i7rtif,My guess? Trying too hard to help carry the team when he's still rather new at this. If Benn and Segs stepped it up I get the feeling some of the pressure would be off and he'd be getting a better feel for the flow of things.
6712,2020-08-11 23:35:42,i7rtif,“Unfit to play”
6713,2020-08-11 23:42:38,i7rtif,Why now? Why not three games ago?
6714,2020-08-11 23:51:43,i7rtif,Do farts count?
6715,2020-08-11 23:57:22,i7rtif,I’m watching both. Tampa game is unreal
6716,2020-08-12 00:01:22,i7rtif,Seth Jones have played 59 minutes. Unreal
6717,2020-08-12 00:03:34,i7rtif,That boy ain't right.
6718,2020-08-12 00:02:44,i7rtif,He had 5 hole there I think.
6719,2020-08-12 00:05:03,i7rtif,"Down 3. 

“Gotta have that stingy defensive front boys”"
6720,2020-08-12 00:05:14,i7rtif,Bones doesn’t seem to give a fuck
6721,2020-08-11 20:30:44,i7rtif,Yes.
6722,2020-08-11 20:07:23,i7rtif,"Raspberry martini, with raspberries and an Okanogan raspberry liquer!"
6723,2020-08-11 20:09:07,i7rtif,ZIN BIN OPEN AT 430!
6724,2020-08-11 21:39:03,i7rtif,I've got Shiner Bock sitting next to a Whataburger Dr. Pepper.
6725,2020-08-11 20:12:05,i7rtif,"Yeah I have high hopes our boys were just saving that energy for the playoff push. They already knew they had the bye, playoffs are all that matter."
6726,2020-08-11 21:17:55,i7rtif,"Dobby Does Dallas. Playoff. Fucking. Hockey. Let's go, boys!"
6727,2020-08-11 21:36:30,i7rtif,Mop head
6728,2020-08-11 21:42:35,i7rtif,Do you have access to fsgo?
6729,2020-08-11 21:42:43,i7rtif,"I feel that, stuck on ads on NBC rn. Also couldnt watch the last ARI NSH game"
6730,2020-08-11 21:44:25,i7rtif,? It's on NBC and fox sports go
6731,2020-08-11 21:47:34,i7rtif,Lmao they hit hard
6732,2020-08-11 21:47:59,i7rtif,#SNIFF
6733,2020-08-11 21:50:42,i7rtif,For real.
6734,2020-08-11 21:51:06,i7rtif,He advanced his game in Pittsburgh
6735,2020-08-11 21:51:47,i7rtif,"I only need him for about 5.

Oh wait... we're talking about ice time...

Well this is awkward now..."
6736,2020-08-11 21:51:00,i7rtif,You will probably see at least 35
6737,2020-08-11 21:54:11,i7rtif,Been that way since the bubble
6738,2020-08-11 21:56:06,i7rtif,"I very much like Janmark, but we need to move on with him. He doesn't produce and could easily be replaced."
6739,2020-08-11 21:56:47,i7rtif,I’m done with Janmark.
6740,2020-08-11 21:57:48,i7rtif,Perfectly balanced as all things should be
6741,2020-08-11 21:58:43,i7rtif,Trying not to get injured is my guess.
6742,2020-08-11 22:00:55,i7rtif,Thank you!! That’s what I thought
6743,2020-08-11 22:04:26,i7rtif,"and even *if it was*, a weak ass penalty at that.  

""I though this was playoff hockey"" - Randy Marsh"
6744,2020-08-11 22:20:15,i7rtif,Sekera is the modern Woywitka.
6745,2020-08-11 22:25:36,i7rtif,Even this lizard is better than Sekera
6746,2020-08-11 22:29:26,i7rtif,I might get some of those birddogs. They look comfy as hell.
6747,2020-08-11 22:33:27,i7rtif,"“Nice period boys. We have them right where we want them. Keep it up. Gold star for your play Sekera.”

6748,2020-08-11 22:38:38,i7rtif,"I hope Bonehead watched the “how to kick a trash can video”

You’re fucking embracing, you’re fucking embracing...bam kicks the trash can and knocks Sekera out."
6749,2020-08-11 22:36:35,i7rtif,Lol imagine if they let fans video conference in to the locker room 😂
6750,2020-08-11 22:53:15,i7rtif,eventually they might be generous enough to score a goal for us
6751,2020-08-11 22:58:38,i7rtif,You better keep that hoodie on in the shower!
6752,2020-08-11 23:00:47,i7rtif,That’s exactly how they’re doing it
6753,2020-08-11 23:00:37,i7rtif,That is their MO.
6754,2020-08-11 23:00:20,i7rtif,"It’s on FSSW, I think the guides may be messed up showing as “Stars vs. Blues”. At least it was on YouTube TV"
6755,2020-08-11 23:07:38,i7rtif,Hope not. Benn is much better than that goon
6756,2020-08-11 23:15:13,i7rtif,Maybe half
6757,2020-08-11 23:14:38,i7rtif,"Like, in a trade? Four."

6759,2020-08-11 23:15:31,i7rtif,Pushed back most likely
6760,2020-08-11 23:15:44,i7rtif,They just gonna play really late I assume.
6761,2020-08-11 23:15:41,i7rtif,You're on the wrong channel.
6762,2020-08-11 23:25:51,i7rtif,"I'd say pick someone random from the stands and put them out there, but...y'know.

Do they still have those fans from the thank you fans dad joke?"

6765,2020-08-11 23:52:12,i7rtif,Korpisalo save % is 97.1. That's absurd!
6766,2020-08-11 23:52:10,i7rtif,Are they still going?
6767,2020-08-11 23:52:38,i7rtif,They're turtling.
6768,2020-08-12 00:00:21,i7rtif,Seriously. It's like the Canes game with the zamboni driver.
6769,2020-08-12 00:00:27,i7rtif,According to the shot counter he has made 22 of them.
6770,2020-08-11 23:58:54,i7rtif,I like miro
6771,2020-08-12 00:04:58,i7rtif,A bushel of bananas
6772,2020-08-12 00:05:00,i7rtif,The limit does not exist.
6773,2020-08-12 00:11:36,i7rtif,Fuck sekera!
6774,2020-08-12 00:27:59,i7rtif,!Sekera indeed man

6777,2020-08-11 22:20:10,i7rtif,Possible 1-13 to end the season. Have some fucking pride and do something out there boys.
6778,2020-08-11 22:20:03,i7rtif,True.  They're gonna get swept.
6779,2020-08-11 17:25:23,i7rtif,GOT EM
6780,2020-08-11 23:21:51,i7rtif,>And Janmark should be nowhere near the ~~top 6.~~ Stars.
6781,2020-08-11 16:54:14,i7rtif,"With our old ass team, don't with that hex on them. lol."
6782,2020-08-11 16:53:00,i7rtif,"4 OTs in the first game of the playoffs?

plz no, my heart..."
6783,2020-08-11 17:05:04,i7rtif,"Same here, the amount  of ""Chuckys comin' for ya"" texts I have is nuts."
6784,2020-08-11 21:25:30,i7rtif,Yes please
6785,2020-08-11 21:25:49,i7rtif,Never too early for some jazz cabbage!
6786,2020-08-11 21:35:28,i7rtif,This is a sacred and exciting time!
6787,2020-08-11 21:35:57,i7rtif,Bishop took warmups so it’s assumed he’s fit to play
6788,2020-08-11 21:41:17,i7rtif,Like it’s too bright?
6789,2020-08-11 21:36:14,i7rtif,are you watching it through the app?
6790,2020-08-11 21:39:40,i7rtif,"sorry to hear it brother, Im stuck with NBC cause Im in Arkansas"
6791,2020-08-11 21:39:41,i7rtif,If you have a cable subscription it’s on NBCSN
6792,2020-08-11 21:45:23,i7rtif,"In the same boat (with no cable and bootleg now) from MN. 

I HATE NHL.tv!"

6794,2020-08-11 21:58:20,i7rtif,Yes
6795,2020-08-11 21:57:54,i7rtif,Unfit to play
6796,2020-08-11 22:05:10,i7rtif,It’s just nbc doing that
6797,2020-08-11 22:18:23,i7rtif,They all need a good punch to the face. Maybe two.
6798,2020-08-11 22:21:41,i7rtif,No. You're right.
6799,2020-08-11 22:24:36,i7rtif,"Why, so we can give him less TOI than Cogs and Perry?"
6800,2020-08-11 22:52:22,i7rtif,CHOO CHOO!
6801,2020-08-11 22:53:06,i7rtif,I’d have gotten half my team ejected by now.
6802,2020-08-11 22:53:54,i7rtif,Yes it’s a normal game
6803,2020-08-11 22:54:12,i7rtif,it's definitely not good. every few minutes something good happens and back to mediocrity. oh and gurianov just scored while i was typing this lol
6804,2020-08-11 23:00:16,i7rtif,That bounce is very deceptive. Goalies aren’t expecting that.
6805,2020-08-11 23:04:00,i7rtif,Let’s hope they stay that way
6806,2020-08-11 23:23:52,i7rtif,To dull the pain or just for fun?
6807,2020-08-11 23:33:52,i7rtif,That better not be his head
6808,2020-08-11 23:33:59,i7rtif,God no. That means even more Sekera. Double whammy
6809,2020-08-11 23:34:29,i7rtif,DISLIKE!!!!
6810,2020-08-11 23:34:39,i7rtif,Bruh
6811,2020-08-11 23:34:11,i7rtif,DISLIKE
6812,2020-08-11 23:35:22,i7rtif,Jesus god no.
6813,2020-08-11 23:37:48,i7rtif,NOOOO
6814,2020-08-11 23:36:24,i7rtif,Is it bad to say I wish it was sekera instead?
6815,2020-08-11 23:36:03,i7rtif,...ew. No thanks.
6816,2020-08-11 23:36:53,i7rtif,Yes
6817,2020-08-11 23:40:35,i7rtif,That’s all we’ll get
6818,2020-08-11 23:39:33,i7rtif,Lmaoooo
6819,2020-08-12 00:03:11,i7rtif,"I snorted.

Well played."
6820,2020-08-12 00:05:21,i7rtif,Can't be heart broken when you expect to lose
6821,2020-08-12 00:05:29,i7rtif,You are watching the wrong team
6822,2020-08-12 00:05:33,i7rtif,No he’s playing at the point.
6823,2020-08-11 22:20:57,i7rtif,Except we beat that team. We’re not going to beat the Flames
6824,2020-08-11 14:54:29,i7rtif,He’s apparently good to go
6825,2020-08-11 16:02:49,i7rtif,I don't think it really matters.  Either guy is going to give you about equal chance to win.  However if one guy could aggravate an injury that then keeps him out the rest of the way that's not great.
6826,2020-08-11 21:00:17,i7rtif,"First Dallas Stars goal.  I will crack one then too, let's hope we get to drink our beer."
6827,2020-08-11 21:39:18,i7rtif,"Yeah that Polaris show is on FSSW+ on my TV, but the game is available on Fox Sports Go for me, so I'm just watching it on my laptop"
6828,2020-08-11 21:37:24,i7rtif,FSSW+
6829,2020-08-11 21:38:48,i7rtif,Stars game probs wont start until lightning is over if they can help it
6830,2020-08-11 21:41:40,i7rtif,Bish is healthy for this game just not starting
6831,2020-08-11 21:47:28,i7rtif,We do. It's an attempt for more gif-able moments
6832,2020-08-11 21:50:19,i7rtif,Yeah it was doing it bad to me when I was watching the Columbus-TB game
6833,2020-08-11 21:50:46,i7rtif,They don’t show it on NBC if that’s where you’re watching.
6834,2020-08-11 21:51:06,i7rtif,They only just appeared on FSSW. NBC doesn’t show them consistently.
6835,2020-08-11 21:50:22,i7rtif,They are for me on fssw
6836,2020-08-11 21:54:08,i7rtif,"Played really solid last few games, played like he deserved the start. Bish was shaky and unfit to play, probably getting start soon though"
6837,2020-08-11 21:54:00,i7rtif,Great question lol
6838,2020-08-11 21:54:23,i7rtif,Bish is day-to-day
6839,2020-08-11 21:56:33,i7rtif,Because he's played better lately and the only goalie to get us a win in 9
6840,2020-08-11 21:56:36,i7rtif,"for the highly specified, detailed, informative reason that Bishop is unfit to play."
6841,2020-08-11 21:56:45,i7rtif,"They haven't matched in the playoffs in most Stars fan's lives. Now you have to make a decision, though."
6842,2020-08-11 21:59:24,i7rtif,Same 😒
6843,2020-08-11 21:59:43,i7rtif,"If you have Fox Sports Go, it's on there"
6844,2020-08-11 21:59:54,i7rtif,It feels like March again.
6845,2020-08-11 22:00:06,i7rtif,Terrible call or penalty to take? always have a hard time understanding interference.
6846,2020-08-11 22:10:35,i7rtif,Yeah we have looked lost in the Ozone for many games now
6847,2020-08-11 22:36:34,i7rtif,Thank you for these!!
6848,2020-08-11 22:34:04,i7rtif,The most you will get from a hockey players is a deep sigh.
6849,2020-08-11 22:46:24,i7rtif,Double OT takes priority.
6850,2020-08-11 22:47:37,i7rtif,Games on a diff channel.
6851,2020-08-11 22:52:20,i7rtif,It’s on Fox Sports Southwest.
6852,2020-08-11 22:53:53,i7rtif,https://images.app.goo.gl/pDkyGqoxuCLqQ15EA
6853,2020-08-11 22:54:29,i7rtif,CHUGG!
6854,2020-08-11 22:54:55,i7rtif,Open that shit
6855,2020-08-11 23:00:35,i7rtif,You know what you have to do...
6856,2020-08-11 23:01:32,i7rtif,KEEP WATCHING THE MAVS! ITS WORKING!!
6857,2020-08-11 23:07:02,i7rtif,Ironic
6858,2020-08-11 23:37:42,i7rtif,"If we win it all, chances are Bowness is replaced either way. He's openly stated he didn't want to be head coach"
6859,2020-08-11 23:39:22,i7rtif,We’re getting a new coach either way. Bones has said he never wanted to be head coach.
6860,2020-08-11 23:37:10,i7rtif,Flames are a physical team...
6861,2020-08-11 23:40:42,i7rtif,Looks like it
6862,2020-08-11 23:42:44,i7rtif,Please
6863,2020-08-12 00:05:05,i7rtif,We lack the ability to complete passes.
6864,2020-08-12 00:08:01,i7rtif,I am ded.
6865,2020-08-12 00:10:30,i7rtif,It rarely goes well for us anyway
6866,2020-08-12 00:10:03,i7rtif,Because the don’t except for a very few. And those who do don’t get the ice time they deserve.
6867,2020-08-12 00:16:13,i7rtif,I agree and honestly best game we've played since season suspension. I was telling all my friends no way we win this series but honestly this game gives me hope.
6868,2020-08-11 23:12:04,i7rtif,Even a lot of locals aren't getting the game.
6869,2020-08-11 23:12:07,i7rtif,I'm watching from Houston IDK if that counts as local or not.
6870,2020-08-11 23:50:13,i7rtif,I know right! plus he's a local!
6871,2020-08-12 00:00:32,i7rtif,"Lol this was my thought exactly, I hope Bowness is aware that we’re down a goal"
6872,2020-08-11 22:15:30,i7rtif,"Same. Solid defensively and we’re getting zone time, not to mention taking shots."
6873,2020-08-11 22:16:11,i7rtif,"We have. This is not out of reach, and not as bad as I expected. It's not terrible."
6874,2020-08-11 22:15:55,i7rtif,"I agree they have for the majority, just a couple of blips fucking our shit up"
6875,2020-08-11 22:17:54,i7rtif,Yeah dude we look fucking great...
6876,2020-08-11 22:14:31,i7rtif,He’s not looking to score with those shots. He wants a deflection or try and generate a rebound.
6877,2020-08-11 22:24:40,i7rtif,Baffles me we had 3+ months to correct this and Nill was like “eh”
6878,2020-08-11 22:44:48,i7rtif,Because Tampa - Columbus is still on intermission?
6879,2020-08-11 22:26:41,i7rtif,These problems existed before Bowness
6880,2020-08-11 22:24:42,i7rtif,F
6881,2020-08-11 22:35:02,i7rtif,you didn’t miss much
6882,2020-08-11 22:37:12,i7rtif,Your stream is fine. It’s our defense that shit the bed.
6883,2020-08-11 22:52:16,i7rtif,They said it's been great. Apparently no fans means the quality is much higher because the arena is much colder.
6884,2020-08-11 22:53:29,i7rtif,The ice is definitely not the problem. Haha
6885,2020-08-11 23:03:48,i7rtif,Me either.  I heard it on replay. But didnt hear it initially
6886,2020-08-11 23:04:46,i7rtif,I just need to shut the hell up.
6887,2020-08-11 23:05:33,i7rtif,Deflected by Sekera
6888,2020-08-11 23:06:06,i7rtif,"Ramped up off of Sekera’s stick, so not entirely his fault"
6889,2020-08-11 23:08:46,i7rtif,He was wearing green
6890,2020-08-11 23:27:39,i7rtif,My blood alcohol level.
6891,2020-08-11 23:29:08,i7rtif,The jackets
6892,2020-08-11 23:27:21,i7rtif,"If we come out hungry, us"
6893,2020-08-11 23:29:59,i7rtif,WE WILL WIN THIS GAME
6894,2020-08-11 23:33:14,i7rtif,Ottawa
6895,2020-08-11 23:52:33,i7rtif,Our game will finish before theirs lol
6896,2020-08-11 23:52:51,i7rtif,Pretty high
6897,2020-08-11 23:57:45,i7rtif,Sekera decided to let them score
6898,2020-08-11 23:58:02,i7rtif,Let’s just say we have found life in the 2nd half of the game. But our goals were pretty s o f t
6899,2020-08-11 23:58:09,i7rtif,little of both
6900,2020-08-11 23:59:04,i7rtif,Calgary definitely let us have a couple for funsies.
6901,2020-08-12 00:01:22,i7rtif,Awful
6902,2020-08-12 00:05:37,i7rtif,Klinger looks worse.
6903,2020-08-12 00:07:11,i7rtif,"/beep

Rick Bowness is a professional hockey coach for the Dallas Stars of the National Hockey League."
6904,2020-08-12 00:06:25,i7rtif,FUCK THE REFS!
6905,2020-08-12 00:07:28,i7rtif,No worst part is if we lose we have to win two in a row
6906,2020-08-11 23:11:36,i7rtif,"Mf not only be the first positive test, but the lick everything in the bubble"
6907,2020-08-11 22:20:06,i7rtif,"Nah, we win at least one. The stars always give us at least a little false hope"
6908,2020-08-11 23:08:40,i7rtif,Nah went off Sek’s stick blade. Cant do much.
6909,2020-08-11 23:07:33,i7rtif,Yeah I want to give him a chance. Maybe he's more hurt than we know.
6910,2020-08-11 23:08:27,i7rtif,"Bish also has a lengthy injury history, so after a long break, probably a pretty easy camp, then playing full speed, probably tweaked his back or something"
6911,2020-08-11 23:09:55,i7rtif,Damn you’re really getting downvoted for this lmao.
6912,2020-08-11 23:25:55,i7rtif,[What method will you choose?](https://youtu.be/96FY6aIKUXE)
6913,2020-08-11 22:07:06,i7rtif,Eh I’m ok with it
6914,2020-08-11 23:19:47,i7rtif,[deleted]
6915,2020-08-11 23:39:11,i7rtif,Finally get a rush and don’t score damn
6916,2020-08-11 23:39:47,i7rtif,The passing lane was blocked there
6917,2020-08-11 23:50:48,i7rtif,The ice is fine.
6918,2020-08-12 00:12:03,i7rtif,Not if Sekera has anything to say about it
6919,2020-08-12 00:12:03,i7rtif,"Nah, complain. That was still a bad game. There's zero direction to this ship. Just a bunch of sailors and no captain. Literally."
6920,2020-08-12 00:14:27,i7rtif,they were very lucky to score on even one of those
6921,2020-08-12 00:11:39,i7rtif,9 seconds of offense lol
6922,2020-08-11 22:44:58,i7rtif,The Stars. In 2021.
6923,2020-08-11 22:40:32,i7rtif,Canes
6924,2020-08-11 22:43:34,i7rtif,Blackhawks for maximum bitching by the fandom.
6925,2020-08-11 22:43:38,i7rtif,"I'd like to see a Canadian team finally get a cup win, so any of them would be fine with me, even the Flames."
6926,2020-08-11 22:45:30,i7rtif,Eastern- Canes. Western- Coyotes
6927,2020-08-11 22:41:35,i7rtif,My wife's a 'yotes fan so I guess I'll start howling.
6928,2020-08-11 22:45:48,i7rtif,Let’s go Red Wings. Wait
6929,2020-08-11 22:49:27,i7rtif,Tampa Bay!
6930,2020-08-11 22:41:15,i7rtif,Columbus because Torts is crazy
6931,2020-08-11 16:53:38,i7rtif,"The Flames broadcast will be on Rogers Sportsnet. PBP guys can be homers, but the broadcasts themselves are excellent, if you can hunt down a stream."
6932,2020-08-11 21:16:44,i7rtif,TKAFUK TKACHUK!

6935,2020-08-11 21:47:10,i7rtif,Yes.
6936,2020-08-11 21:48:54,i7rtif,"The Stars feel like one of those teams with nearly endless talent that just hasn't been able to put it together. 

I'm keeping the expectations low and just trying to enjoy the ride. They haven't done well since the restart of the season, but perhaps we'll be pleasantly surprised."
6937,2020-08-11 23:32:52,i7rtif,It will surprise you that both were scored within 10 seconds
6938,2020-08-11 23:08:11,i7rtif,Saucy
6939,2020-08-11 23:04:19,i7rtif,So fucking awful.  The vocals make me want to stab my ears.  How can people enjoy that awful ugly twangy voice
6940,2020-08-11 23:03:28,i7rtif,But the Stars are from Texas and the Flames home barn is the Saddledome so they're just trying to make both teams happy!
6941,2020-08-11 23:15:32,i7rtif,Is the giant green brick wearing #5 in green the step stool?
6942,2020-08-11 23:23:28,i7rtif,Sekera keeps getting it back out.
6943,2020-08-12 00:08:38,i7rtif,https://youtu.be/D2Y74nGI38k
6944,2020-08-12 00:08:36,i7rtif,“First! You grab your bread. Smear that shit with mustard. Grab some lettuce and turkey. Put that on there. You got a sandwich... wait I have to make an offensive game plan?”
6945,2020-08-11 22:47:50,i7rtif,Dicky? Really?
6946,2020-08-11 22:48:13,i7rtif,I’m down for that entire list but Dicky. He has a place on this team.
6947,2020-08-11 22:48:08,i7rtif,I like Dicky though.
6948,2020-08-11 22:49:01,i7rtif,"Dude Dicky and Comeau, really? That's a touch to far."
6949,2020-08-11 22:21:58,i7rtif,Can we not
6950,2020-08-11 22:21:59,i7rtif,Fuck outta here with that shit
6951,2020-08-11 22:22:59,i7rtif,Get the fuck out of here with that shit.
6952,2020-08-11 22:23:24,i7rtif,Get the hell out of here with that crap.

6954,2020-08-11 23:40:21,i7rtif,I have a hard time calling the person responsible for 50% of tonight scoring worthless
6955,2020-08-11 23:41:27,i7rtif,"For what it’s worth, he had to hold it with the guy sliding in front of him and didn’t have a great passing lane"
6956,2020-08-11 23:40:21,i7rtif,You need to be more specific. You could be referring to anyone on this team.
6957,2020-08-11 22:15:51,i7rtif,Bish isn’t getting moved.
6958,2020-08-11 22:16:11,i7rtif,Lol
6959,2020-08-11 22:15:39,i7rtif,Wrong take
6960,2020-08-12 00:12:45,i7rtif,You said this last season and yet you’re still here
6961,2020-08-11 23:06:08,i7rtif,Who?
6962,2020-08-11 23:47:57,i7rtif,"Columbus:
Ah yes, let’s give up a top 2 D for an offensive top 4 d and two 4th liners"
6963,2020-08-11 23:48:59,i7rtif,"Klinger?

That's your no."

6965,2020-08-11 22:06:26,i7rtif,No need to be a Negative Nancy. There's still 48 minutes of game left.
6966,2020-08-11 22:12:07,i7rtif,Here we call that consistency
6967,2020-08-12 19:15:12,i7rtif,Lmao didn’t they fight in the game?
6968,2020-08-11 16:18:43,i7rtif,YOU KNOW WHAT BURNS BRIGHTER THAN A FLAME? A BOMBASS STAR. LETS GOOOOOOO
6969,2020-08-11 19:59:34,i7rtif,Unless Doc Emeric is calling the game. I like Doc *almost* as much as Josh and Razor.
6970,2020-08-11 17:57:28,i7rtif,:)

6972,2020-08-11 22:28:56,i7rtif,"We’ve been doing this for the last what, five years now?"
6973,2020-08-11 22:31:00,i7rtif,"I think Fedun is still day to day?

But I'd put anything in there to keep Sekera out."
6974,2020-08-11 22:29:54,i7rtif,This. Exactly.
6975,2020-08-11 23:09:25,i7rtif,Into the sun?
6976,2020-08-11 16:13:58,i7rtif,Amoo
6977,2020-08-11 23:21:59,i7rtif,but muh veterans!
6978,2020-08-11 22:30:33,i7rtif,"Defensive team = ""only wins when the other team can't seem to buy a goal"""
6979,2020-08-11 22:45:22,i7rtif,"We don’t do that here, unfortunately"
6980,2020-08-11 23:38:57,i7rtif,"He’s in the flow for sure, luckily he’s got a team that skates harder in a triple overtime than we do most periods haha!"
6981,2020-08-11 15:43:44,i7rtif,Let's do it!  Maybe that's what they were missing!  $25/goal?
6982,2020-08-11 22:40:43,i7rtif,Yes! You are what was missing! In the St Louis game we started drinking in the second and really picked it up! WE did it! What are you drinking? Coors light here!
6983,2020-08-11 23:06:23,i7rtif,THE STARS WON THE CUP 21 YEARS AGO AND I AM DRINKING 21 YEAR OLD SCOTCH.  GLENFARCLAS.  OH YES!
6984,2020-08-11 23:00:52,i7rtif,Anything.
6985,2020-08-11 23:01:41,i7rtif,True
6986,2020-08-11 23:02:29,i7rtif,"I think NHL app has it as a Benn goal

Edit: nvm it's a Rad's goal, IDK if they changed it or I just misread."
6987,2020-08-11 23:08:20,i7rtif,Fedun. Or Hanley
6988,2020-08-11 23:12:04,i7rtif,"The puck bag, empty. 

Just chuck it out there for his shift."
6989,2020-08-11 23:47:28,i7rtif,No one is sure
6990,2020-08-12 00:19:02,i7rtif,"I agree

Radulovs dangles earlier perfect example."

6992,2020-08-11 20:00:49,i7rtif,*Get the puck to the net*
6993,2020-08-11 20:53:09,i7rtif,Going cheese.
6994,2020-08-11 21:39:53,i7rtif,Yeah and then just as he is falling in love Big Rig ends things abruptly and breaks his heart. LFG STARS!!
6995,2020-08-11 21:39:43,i7rtif,A date with the boards and Tkachuk is paying.
6996,2020-08-11 21:43:31,i7rtif,TKAFUK TKACHUK!
6997,2020-08-11 22:23:40,i7rtif,"I have such a hard time remembering the before times, to be honest"
6998,2020-08-11 22:25:25,i7rtif,Then Harley or Bayreuther
6999,2020-08-11 22:24:38,i7rtif,"Well yeah, but..."
7000,2020-08-12 00:13:50,i7rtif,Hanley is a vet too
7001,2020-08-11 22:32:25,i7rtif,Seems legit.
7002,2020-08-11 23:28:52,i7rtif,"Always tarps off boys, ferda"
7003,2020-08-11 23:19:03,i7rtif,Improvise. Adapt. Overcome.
7004,2020-08-12 00:13:19,i7rtif,Calgary loves chocolate milk I guess
7005,2020-08-11 23:01:09,i7rtif,Pussies?
7006,2020-08-11 21:39:24,i7rtif,jesus :(
7007,2020-08-11 21:40:35,i7rtif,I’ve been trying to cut down on carbs but that’s some tasty pasta
7008,2020-08-11 22:23:22,i7rtif,"Agreed. At least Polak had the size so his reach was a bit better, so when players flew by him the .01% he chance he would poke check would work"
7009,2020-08-11 23:25:02,i7rtif,When? LOL he was gigantic but he never did ANYTHING to throw the body.
7010,2020-08-11 22:37:32,i7rtif,Damn
7011,2020-08-11 22:59:45,i7rtif,My God.
7012,2020-08-11 23:14:34,i7rtif,"True, but he had just over 3 minutes last period"
7013,2020-08-11 23:35:08,i7rtif,Score zero times.
7014,2020-08-11 23:52:46,i7rtif,"The only time I’ve noticed him was that one shift with Benn and rads near the end of the 2nd. They split them up to “spread” the offense out, but if that’s our best option I say go with it"
7015,2020-08-11 15:14:27,i7rtif,FUCK THE BLUES!
7016,2020-08-11 15:33:00,i7rtif,And still win in six.
7017,2020-08-11 16:28:02,i7rtif,Scary for me
7018,2020-08-11 18:32:37,i7rtif,"I’m glad I came up with it after the high of the shootout win.  Figured it was popular but it was off the top. 

And Calgary and Banff is one of my favorite places on earth so under normal circumstances I would’ve definitely flown up for a game for this series.  

Good luck and hope it goes Atleast 5"
7019,2020-08-11 22:25:14,i7rtif,Por que no los dos?
7020,2020-08-11 22:30:06,i7rtif,Yes
7021,2020-08-11 22:21:48,i7rtif,Pebble > Sekera
7022,2020-08-12 02:48:58,i7rtif,"Jack Johnson> sekera

Honka> sekera"
7023,2020-08-11 22:30:53,i7rtif,I saw...and then remembered Jamie Benn doing his best mannequin impersonation during a powerplay.
7024,2020-08-11 22:30:09,i7rtif,"Haha...it kills me because of all the articles I read saying how ""defense needs to get involved in scoring"" Like, bro...they're literally carrying this fucking team despite Sekera."
7025,2020-08-11 22:33:20,i7rtif,Leaving the fast guy with a decent shot on the bench. Great plan.
7026,2020-08-11 22:35:10,i7rtif,">Only players on the ice less... Hintz (3:58)

wait, wtf"
7027,2020-08-11 22:31:06,i7rtif,Ooh 4:19 too much.
7028,2020-08-11 22:35:32,i7rtif,Do they though??? Cant we just leave them out there?
7029,2020-08-11 23:08:31,i7rtif,"DRINK WATER MY DUDE WE STILL HAVE 3 GAMES LEFT, CHRIST"
7030,2020-08-11 23:24:06,i7rtif,"Fedun and Bayreuther are both more reliable than Sekera. I really hope that this game will blatantly show Bowness that he shouldn't ever again wear green on the ice. One player can win or lose you a game, let's hope he won't lose us a series."
7031,2020-08-11 23:22:17,i7rtif,"IDK, Dobby has made some pretty great saves."
7032,2020-08-11 21:36:20,i7rtif,dont get greedy now
7033,2020-08-11 22:12:25,i7rtif,The injury/blood thing for a major is kind of silly criteria if you think about it. What if in the NFL it was only unnecessary roughness if someone was hurt?
7034,2020-08-11 22:12:34,i7rtif,Yep.  My theory is you have to lay there long enough
7035,2020-08-11 22:12:45,i7rtif,Then why’d he go for treatment?
7036,2020-08-11 22:25:15,i7rtif,LOL looks like it’s time to make a sekera only bingo card
7037,2020-08-11 23:08:35,i7rtif,I do :-(
7038,2020-08-11 23:35:19,i7rtif,Radio broadcast
7039,2020-08-11 23:33:34,i7rtif,Neither did Hitch
7040,2020-08-11 23:44:51,i7rtif,Mirp
7041,2020-08-11 20:01:09,i7rtif,Hockey!
7042,2020-08-11 21:36:07,i7rtif,"Lol. Great job NHL, what high level fucking genius couldn’t figure this issue out? What trash."
7043,2020-08-11 21:37:56,i7rtif,"And it’s blacked out on NHL because “national broadcast” of course LOL. Which isn’t accessible while the Tampa game is on. 

It’s truly fucking pathetic that in 2020, during Covid at that, this fucking garbage continues to exist."
7044,2020-08-11 21:42:14,i7rtif,"Insane that they didn’t consider this with scheduling/broadcasting. First World Problems over here, but JFC it’s just asinine. 

On the plus side I guess I’ll just leave it on the stream I’m on with Razor and Josh now that I’ve set it up."
7045,2020-08-11 21:37:50,i7rtif,It won’t fix no matter what I do. Idk wtf is going on.
7046,2020-08-11 21:56:55,i7rtif,mirp
7047,2020-08-11 21:57:38,i7rtif,Mirp
7048,2020-08-11 22:09:05,i7rtif,"Definitely true. Kris Russell to Dallas for Jyrki Jokipakka, Brett Pollock, and a 2016 2nd round pick."
7049,2020-08-11 22:19:46,i7rtif,Of course he was!
7050,2020-08-11 22:52:54,i7rtif,There are plenty of stats out there that would support this system does not work..yet our front office appears to ignore those and continue with dump and chase and hope for the best
7051,2020-08-11 23:09:30,i7rtif,Bae or Harley would be better.  Sekera has been doing the same shit all year.
7052,2020-08-11 23:08:47,i7rtif,Polak was even shittier. Neither one should be here.
7053,2020-08-11 23:52:20,i7rtif,If they make noise.
7054,2020-08-11 23:59:07,i7rtif,So fucking unreal. Korpisalo is playing out of his damn mind
7055,2020-08-12 00:01:39,i7rtif,And he still looks better than our entire team other than miro lol
7056,2020-08-11 21:43:13,i7rtif,dont you have to buy that?
7057,2020-08-11 21:47:58,i7rtif,? It’s not. A lot of us are having problems with it playing stuff that’s not the game.
7058,2020-08-11 21:52:34,i7rtif,Absolutely!
7059,2020-08-11 21:52:35,i7rtif,That's a little wild for game 1 lol I think we give everyone a shot before that
7060,2020-08-11 21:55:50,i7rtif,Before the bubble
7061,2020-08-11 21:58:34,i7rtif,~~bubble~~ 2016.
7062,2020-08-11 22:26:24,i7rtif,Janmark is wandell if that’s the case lol
7063,2020-08-11 22:26:36,i7rtif,:)
7064,2020-08-11 22:55:04,i7rtif,"Haha, speak of the devil."
7065,2020-08-11 23:01:19,i7rtif,It’s not that. It says the right thing but isn’t playing it. Did this last game too.
7066,2020-08-11 23:08:54,i7rtif,"2016 Benn yes, 2020 Benn no."
7067,2020-08-11 23:16:02,i7rtif,"Geez, four? Who do you think we could fleece that badly?"
7068,2020-08-11 23:15:38,i7rtif,I have 2 laying around my house somewhere
7069,2020-08-11 23:15:51,i7rtif,lol
7070,2020-08-11 23:15:45,i7rtif,big oof
7071,2020-08-11 23:31:14,i7rtif,ENTIRELY too accurate. Hahaha.
7072,2020-08-11 23:52:47,i7rtif,3 minutes left yeah
7073,2020-08-12 00:33:13,i7rtif,Haha thanks
7074,2020-08-11 16:54:50,i7rtif,At least we’d be plenty warmed up I guess
7075,2020-08-11 19:43:24,i7rtif,"If we ARE gonna have a 4OT game, please let it be the one thats starts at 4:30 and not the 9:30pm ones..."
7076,2020-08-11 17:23:27,i7rtif,Chucky LOL. Benn and/or Rig look forward to little Chucky trying to get cute
7077,2020-08-11 21:27:23,i7rtif,The electric lettuce
7078,2020-08-11 21:38:11,i7rtif,Then why might he not be?
7079,2020-08-11 21:46:43,i7rtif,Most definitely. It’s all washed out.
7080,2020-08-11 21:36:48,i7rtif,On my computer browser.
7081,2020-08-11 21:42:07,i7rtif,I don't have cable. Just internet. Looks like it's bootleg streams for me tonight boys!
7082,2020-08-11 21:46:19,i7rtif,"Bootleg club!!!

What are you drinking tonight my pirate friend?"
7083,2020-08-11 21:53:15,i7rtif,Mirp
7084,2020-08-11 21:53:24,i7rtif,Miro

7086,2020-08-11 23:36:48,i7rtif,Magnificent
7087,2020-08-11 23:38:00,i7rtif,Good bot
7088,2020-08-11 16:10:29,i7rtif,"I disagree with the first part. Bishop, as evident by last year's playoffs, has a higher upside than Dobby. However, if Bish is hurt, it could be worse than starting Dobby if he can't move side to side like he normally would."
7089,2020-08-11 21:01:43,i7rtif,How about this whatever comes first Dallas goal or start of the third because I want this beer lol.
7090,2020-08-11 21:19:27,i7rtif,I'll join as well! Go stars!
7091,2020-08-11 21:38:01,i7rtif,Both have the same show on for me somehow
7092,2020-08-11 21:43:01,i7rtif,Oh I thought I saw Oettinger getting suited up in the dressing room.
7093,2020-08-11 21:50:59,i7rtif,It’s bugging the shit out of me holy shit that Tampa game better end quick so I can switch back to cable
7094,2020-08-11 21:55:04,i7rtif,but i thought that since he was practising he was fit to play?
7095,2020-08-11 22:00:15,i7rtif,"I'll still go for the Stars, but I do want the Flames to win it if we get bounced, to potentially have the Flames raise the trophy in Edmonton."
7096,2020-08-11 22:01:06,i7rtif,I thought it was a terrible penalty to take.. it was so unnecessary for Rads to do that even if it wasn’t a penalty in some people’s eyes
7097,2020-08-11 22:37:22,i7rtif,:)
7098,2020-08-11 22:46:56,i7rtif,That’s bullshit
7099,2020-08-11 22:47:25,i7rtif,"Annoyed as I am, no one is missing anything with Dallas lol"
7100,2020-08-11 22:53:27,i7rtif,My Southwest has the Rangers on
7101,2020-08-11 23:14:27,i7rtif,I'm in Houston. FSSW the stars game on. I have direct on channel 676-2
7102,2020-08-11 22:15:34,i7rtif,"I feel like I understand those situation but there was zero shot at the net, and he was off balance. Just pass it dude. We are on the PP."
7103,2020-08-11 22:50:18,i7rtif,Luckily I'm watching both.
7104,2020-08-11 22:29:39,i7rtif,I know right? It's like people think we completely changed overnight when Bones took over. We haven't really fundamentally changes systems at all.
7105,2020-08-11 22:27:52,i7rtif,U
7106,2020-08-11 22:38:26,i7rtif,Aw well that's disappointing
7107,2020-08-11 22:54:15,i7rtif,"That makes sense. I've just noticed the puck bouncing a lot and players slipping. I've watched other games, so I'm just curious."
7108,2020-08-11 23:04:55,i7rtif,As Razor said it was a squeaker lol
7109,2020-08-11 23:28:18,i7rtif,Large tequila poured for this 3rd
7110,2020-08-12 00:03:46,i7rtif,Sekera playing for the flames
7111,2020-08-12 00:06:39,i7rtif,I would say I agree
7112,2020-08-11 23:03:48,i7rtif, Very true
7113,2020-08-11 23:28:23,i7rtif,"Lmfao. All of them. And maybe throw a can at Sekera's head? Maybe not, as I might choose the high road.  

But when you playing trash can hockey, this is the speech."
7114,2020-08-11 23:25:42,i7rtif,He's directing traffic into the goal
7115,2020-08-11 23:40:42,i7rtif,"I said this before the 3 on 1, but I agree with that"
7116,2020-08-12 00:15:51,i7rtif,True. A victory in this serious would be from pure grit. He have absolutely no offensive gameplan.
7117,2020-08-11 22:41:21,i7rtif,Canes have my second favourite pair of Finns
7118,2020-08-11 16:57:59,i7rtif,Thanks bro.
7119,2020-08-11 18:23:15,i7rtif,"In for a treat with Cuthbert calling it too. Not sure how bad they'll be RE: homers, generally find Canadian broadcasts less homer oriented than American broadcasts (with the exception of a couple teams, which have thankfully all been eliminated)"
7120,2020-08-11 21:32:57,i7rtif,Oh man thanks!!
7121,2020-08-11 21:47:29,i7rtif,Certainly.
7122,2020-08-11 23:33:19,i7rtif,Yes it does. BY RADS?!?
7123,2020-08-11 23:04:25,i7rtif,It's never Texas country though :( Always Nashville crap.
7124,2020-08-11 23:04:25,i7rtif,I fully expect some Cowboy Troy to be played at some point
7125,2020-08-11 23:37:41,i7rtif,Yep.  IMO you only call injuries or preventing scoring chances in OT in playoffs.
7126,2020-08-11 23:42:27,i7rtif,I don't think he's \*worthless\* but I don't think that was his goal either.
7127,2020-08-11 23:44:16,i7rtif,"Eh, Josh and I disagree. That's the time to elevate a shot. 

100% the pass wasn't there."
7128,2020-08-11 23:43:07,i7rtif,Now that's fair.
7129,2020-08-12 00:16:11,i7rtif,and I'll say it next game
7130,2020-08-11 23:50:12,i7rtif,[deleted]
7131,2020-08-11 22:14:34,i7rtif,We will not win a game with out a shut out
7132,2020-08-11 22:13:29,i7rtif,idk why I get downvoted u all know it's true
7133,2020-08-11 20:50:27,i7rtif,He DRIIIIVES! me crazy.
7134,2020-08-11 22:32:07,i7rtif,Oh snap didn’t realize that. Fuck at this point I’d throw a forward back there. Not like we know how to score anyways
7135,2020-08-11 23:11:18,i7rtif,"Or, hear me out.

&#x200B;

The earth's core."
7136,2020-08-11 23:23:37,i7rtif,MuH vEtErAnS dOn'T MaKe MiStAkEs
7137,2020-08-11 22:46:17,i7rtif,What's a shoot?
7138,2020-08-11 23:39:47,i7rtif,Yeah CBJ may not be the most talented squad but they HUSTLE
7139,2020-08-11 16:49:35,i7rtif,perfect!
7140,2020-08-11 22:44:23,i7rtif,"I'm not OP of that comment, but I'm sipping bourbon (Knob Creek) as I don't have any beer."
7141,2020-08-11 22:51:17,i7rtif,Dos Equis
7142,2020-08-11 23:13:16,i7rtif,"Ah yes, Glenfarclas. A Speyside gem. Distilled on the edge of the Cairngorms area of beauty. Just before where they Spey and Avon rivers meet in the beautiful village of Ballindalloch. Love the region (not as much as the under appreciated Caithness and Orkney whisky's. But still a wonderful scotch."
7143,2020-08-11 23:09:09,i7rtif,"I forgot about Hanley, Sekera is TERRIBLE but I'm not convinced Fedun is any better."
7144,2020-08-11 23:12:35,i7rtif,lol.
7145,2020-08-11 23:48:55,i7rtif,He just left the game?
7146,2020-08-12 13:10:12,i7rtif,"I say the players just go rogue and ignore this false identity our roster has been made to play the last couple seasons. I too am looking forward to the future....I just hope the right decision is made and don't have much faith. Young, energetic, and non defense-first, non turtle believing coach is what we need."
7147,2020-08-12 14:08:28,i7rtif,As long as Janmark gets more minutes than Guri or Roope we'll be ok.
7148,2020-08-11 22:28:38,i7rtif,In the long long ago...
7149,2020-08-11 23:31:08,i7rtif,FERDA!
7150,2020-08-11 23:02:02,i7rtif,Exactly
7151,2020-08-11 21:41:52,i7rtif,A classic
7152,2020-08-11 23:41:15,i7rtif,Polak Smash!!!
7153,2020-08-11 23:10:37,i7rtif,[deleted]
7154,2020-08-11 23:18:27,i7rtif,"Can’t be trusted by this spineless bitch of a coach. 

Sekera on the other hand..."
7155,2020-08-11 15:36:41,i7rtif,Dallas has played well against Calgary. I’m confident in this match up. My 5 goals comment was a joke. People lighten up
7156,2020-08-11 22:15:24,i7rtif,[deleted]
7157,2020-08-11 23:42:57,i7rtif,Nice
7158,2020-08-11 23:34:09,i7rtif,Yup. And it was stupid of the both of them.
7159,2020-08-11 22:02:57,i7rtif,https://youtu.be/dFVcAEqvLek
7160,2020-08-11 21:39:11,i7rtif,Game is on fssw+
7161,2020-08-11 23:16:57,i7rtif,"I disagree there. Polak put his all in for the team every shift, and at least he was consistently physical. Sekera is consistent trash. I'll believe Polak is better than Sekera until the day I die."
7162,2020-08-11 23:53:14,i7rtif,"I'm in there like swimwear, baby!"
7163,2020-08-11 21:44:46,i7rtif,It works with a cable login
7164,2020-08-11 21:49:28,i7rtif,I’m watching on fox sports go right now so I’m not sure what’s up.
7165,2020-08-11 21:56:46,i7rtif,Also true
7166,2020-08-11 21:56:53,i7rtif,after the bubble
7167,2020-08-11 23:17:18,i7rtif,"Lucic : 8 goals, 12 assist
Benn: 19 goals, 20 assist 

He's overpaid shadow of his former self, but still... I'll take Benn"
7168,2020-08-11 23:17:24,i7rtif,Toronto
7169,2020-08-11 23:18:21,i7rtif,[deleted]
7170,2020-08-11 21:41:19,i7rtif,Dobby has played better ?
7171,2020-08-11 21:51:55,i7rtif,"Summit Oktoberfest. 

What about you?

CHEERS!"
7172,2020-08-11 21:56:21,i7rtif,Miro
7173,2020-08-11 21:54:20,i7rtif,Miro
7174,2020-08-11 21:03:28,i7rtif,"Done, the stress will be palpable by then."
7175,2020-08-11 21:30:23,i7rtif,Username checks out
7176,2020-08-11 21:39:43,i7rtif,Same here. Idk wtf is going on.
7177,2020-08-11 21:46:39,i7rtif,"Ah, I’m just going off a Sean tweet that said bish took warmups. Could be wrong on who’s backup though"
7178,2020-08-11 21:55:07,i7rtif,I'm just watching the Stars game in Fox Sports Go. Much better announcers anyway
7179,2020-08-11 21:58:11,i7rtif,“Unfit to play” umbrella covers healthy scratches.
7180,2020-08-11 22:07:38,i7rtif,Gotcha
7181,2020-08-11 22:48:09,i7rtif,Fsgo app. Sign in with your tv provider
7182,2020-08-11 23:15:51,i7rtif,Yeah I'm watching it fine on Foxsportsgo
7183,2020-08-11 23:16:26,i7rtif,Also shout out to my fellow Houstonian Starsbro!
7184,2020-08-11 22:37:18,i7rtif,C
7185,2020-08-11 23:36:14,i7rtif,"I \*think\* both goals were credited wrong.

Should be Guri (off Flames D) and Benn."
7186,2020-08-11 23:07:16,i7rtif,The only thing country wise that's good that's come outta Nashville is Upchurch imo
7187,2020-08-11 23:43:24,i7rtif,"Hey, he was the last to touch it before it went in, it's his goal"
7188,2020-08-11 23:56:18,i7rtif,That’s what I was getting at
7189,2020-08-12 00:17:58,i7rtif,So obviously you’re not “done with this shit” then.
7190,2020-08-13 14:40:27,i7rtif,I was just being emotional I love Victor
7191,2020-08-11 22:15:31,i7rtif,Just have faith. It's going to be a good series.
7192,2020-08-11 22:17:19,i7rtif,It's barely Five - We're still sober
7193,2020-08-11 22:49:34,i7rtif,are you guys talking about when you take shots because the team is bad
7194,2020-08-11 23:45:57,i7rtif,"It’s one of the most valuable traits you could hope for in a team! may not go far but theres an intangible element to it that isnt always reflected in the scores, plus it’s beautiful hockey to watch"
7195,2020-08-11 22:46:32,i7rtif,Haha sorry. Cheers anyway!!!
7196,2020-08-11 23:20:06,i7rtif,"Oh, I love me some Orkney whisky.  The 12 year old Highland Park is a go to for me, and in fact I have a bottle waiting to be opened right now.

But Glenfarclas is one of my favourite Speyside malts and I grabbed a bottle just for the playoff run."
7197,2020-08-11 23:12:25,i7rtif,Fedun cant really be any worse
7198,2020-08-11 23:49:44,i7rtif,Basically.
7199,2020-08-11 23:02:44,i7rtif,Like how rugby players don’t want rugby to be compared to American football. Yeah I get it
7200,2020-08-11 23:11:50,i7rtif,I always knew my life would be important one day. Here goes nothing.
7201,2020-08-11 22:16:15,i7rtif,Did I just hallucinate him going off?
7202,2020-08-11 21:50:03,i7rtif,It’s not. It says it is but it’s playing something that’s not the game dude.
7203,2020-08-11 23:23:42,i7rtif,"Lmfao, physical? Polak? Dude was a teddy bear. He was beyond horrible. 

I will never understand this sub’s affection for Polak. He’s the worst hockey player I’ve ever seen."
7204,2020-08-11 21:50:42,i7rtif,"It’s not everybody, man. But there’s a lot of us that the same thing is happening too."
7205,2020-08-11 23:18:31,i7rtif,I love you both
7206,2020-08-11 21:57:46,i7rtif,"Cheers! Just skunky coors light for me! It's what I drank during the second and third period against the Blues two nights ago. If it works, I'll keep it going."
7207,2020-08-11 21:08:12,i7rtif,And so it shall be.
7208,2020-08-12 00:00:30,i7rtif,WHY CANT WE HAVE A TEAM?!?! Seattle with a population of 750k gets one. Here we are with a huge market population 2.1 million and growing and we don't have a hockey team? This is some bull honkey.
7209,2020-08-11 23:08:27,i7rtif,The sad thing is Tennessee does have some really great music and history but it all goes into the Nashville machine and comes out sounding exactly the same.
7210,2020-08-11 23:45:07,i7rtif,"That's what I'm saying, I don't think he really was. I think the goal was Benn's."
7211,2020-08-12 00:23:35,i7rtif,i have to get my anger out
7212,2020-08-12 00:14:16,i7rtif,It will not... 5 games max
7213,2020-08-11 22:48:25,i7rtif,"All good, prosit!"
7214,2020-08-11 23:24:25,i7rtif,Very nice! Love highland park. Have you tried Woldburn? It's made in Thurso and quite good!
7215,2020-08-11 23:13:40,i7rtif,You know what at this point you're right.
7216,2020-08-11 22:20:25,i7rtif,[deleted]
7217,2020-08-11 21:52:41,i7rtif,"Weird. Seems like some people are getting it and others not, maybe it’s a provider thing? Idk, I’m watching on fsgo which has them separated, hope it gets figured out tho"
7218,2020-08-11 21:51:24,i7rtif,Where are you? Is it region locked maybe?
7219,2020-08-11 22:06:21,i7rtif,"If it works, it's perfect!"
7220,2020-08-12 00:06:28,i7rtif,The Aeros had higher average attendance than several NHL teams for gods sake!
7221,2020-08-11 23:47:26,i7rtif,"Nah you could see it in the replay, Rads definitely tipped it"
7222,2020-08-12 00:37:38,i7rtif,"With the way we played towards the middle of the game onwards, I predict a 7 game series."
7223,2020-08-11 23:26:50,i7rtif,"I haven't, but I'll add that to my list of things I want to try.  I wonder how available it is in Texas or if I'll be placing an order on The Whisky Exchange."
7224,2020-08-11 23:21:18,i7rtif,"Thats where I’m at too, if Fedun sucks too, swap em again! I feel like the 6th man on any blue line should, in a sense, be fighting to earn ice time. Sekera just isn’t it right now. Give the kids a chance, at the least they hopefully wont get dusted as badly"
7225,2020-08-11 22:21:25,i7rtif,Huh I’ve never met somebody who disliked dickie so much.
7226,2020-08-11 21:53:22,i7rtif,Did this last game too. Idk. My dad has Spectrum and he’s getting it just fine.
7227,2020-08-11 21:52:19,i7rtif,I’m in ft. Worth. And again. It says it’s playing but it. But it’s playing a different thing.
7228,2020-08-12 01:07:47,i7rtif,Unfortunately when I moved to Houston in 2005 I didn't know there was a Hockey Team. I didn't find out until it was announced they were leaving
7229,2020-08-12 00:01:57,i7rtif,"I strongly disagree. 

It's Benn's goal officially now."
7230,2020-08-12 01:59:17,i7rtif,"Can I pay you to be my personal hype man? You have the gift of positivity 

We scored an insanely lucky 2 goals. Should have been 3-0 blow"
7231,2020-08-12 09:46:00,i7rtif,Agree!
7232,2020-08-11 22:27:34,i7rtif,[deleted]
7233,2020-08-11 21:55:36,i7rtif,That’s so weird. NBC isn’t working either?
7234,2020-08-12 01:18:12,i7rtif,You ever make it to the maple leaf for games?
7235,2020-08-12 00:05:48,i7rtif,Huh could’ve sworn I saw it go off rads. My bad.
7236,2020-08-12 02:33:31,i7rtif,"After what's happened with my family, especially my dad, I've learned that being positive and trying to find the good in every situation as well as just never giving up goes a long way, man. Our goals may have been lucky, but our work along the boards and the way we kept keeping the puck in their zone, in some cases for over a minute or more and getting their guys tired and continuously scrambling is a big positive!

If we can keep up stuff like that and not have as many hiccups in our own zone and having Sekera not be a total dunce on ice, we can definitely go far."
7237,2020-08-11 22:30:03,i7rtif,I'd take him over Janmark easy.
7238,2020-08-11 21:58:43,i7rtif,CBJ and Tampa in OT. Stars are “Bonus Coverage” so it takes priority.
7239,2020-08-12 02:35:25,i7rtif,The what? I have not
7240,2020-08-12 00:06:55,i7rtif,"It was close. 

Guri's goal too. I think that one went off the D, but hasn't been changed officially."
7241,2020-08-11 21:59:32,i7rtif,Ah that makes sense well hopefully you’ll eventually be able to get it there at least. Sorry about the shitty situation.
7242,2020-08-12 02:38:33,i7rtif,"Hockey bar in midtown. It’s great for watching games, you know when the pandemic is over in thirty or forty years. I say bar it’s more of a pub."
7243,2020-08-11 22:02:22,i7rtif,Im on hold with stupid ass Spectrum right now. 16-24 minute wait time. Hopefully I can get some answers.
7244,2020-08-12 11:57:00,i7rtif,I looked it up. How did I never know about this place? Do people wear their team jerseys when they go there? I hope so. I'll have to check it out when everything reopens.
7245,2020-08-12 12:27:02,i7rtif,Yes! Lots of us wear our jerseys. There’s a good mix of different fan bases there’s a a handful of starS fans but we’re certainly not the majority. Houston is so full of transplants that fortunately it’s not really a [insert this team] bar. Their poutine is ace by the way.
7246,2020-08-12 19:28:01,i7rtif,"Never had poutine. Ill definitely have to check this place out. As soon as this freaking quarantine ends!!! Wake me up, when quarantine ends."
7247,2020-08-11 11:54:33,i7q6hz,"I think it’s important to be critical of any media that you watch, and to form your own opinion on it.

Peele had an amazing and thought provoking first debut, with Get Out, but people were more critical about his second film, Us. I feel like some people were still under the impression that he was going to create something similar to Get Out, and maybe went into that mindset watching Us. But the high amount of praise that Peele got for Get Out, wasn’t at the same level as Us.

For Jenkins, his first film didn’t receive that much attention. I only knew of him when Moonlight came out, and that film obviously got a lot of attention, praise, and awards. The same could be said with his third film, If Beale Street Could Talk.

And with Lee, people have mixed reactions about his work. Some people think he’s a cinematic genius, and others are more critical of his work. When Blackkklansman came out, some people were critical about the message he was sending out with his movie, and weren’t receptive to the movie because of that.

No one is saying black directors have to be perfect in all that they do, but I’ve definitely seen people be critical and analyze black directors work. The same as with any other group of directors, white and other directors of color"
7248,2020-08-11 12:20:35,i7q6hz,"It might help if you could expand on which acclaimed movies about black experiences (and by black directors) you think have been ""boosted""? Because I have to take exception to your whole premise: I'm not remotely convinced that films made by black artists have tended to receive ""unfounded praise"" in recent years. The only films which have received particular praise were - in my view - entirely deserving of it.

Even if *Da 5 Bloods* is overrated (I haven't seen it), and even if this is in part due to the blackness of its creators, I think there's more to it than that. Spike Lee is a highly acclaimed and respected director, and whether or not he's black, I think that makes his films liable to be overrated, and also means that whenever one of his films *is* highly rated, there will always be people who argue that's more because of who he is than the quality of the work. The exact same thing happened last year with *The Irishman* \- lots of people liked it; lots of people didn't and attributed it's acclaim to Scorcese's reputation.

Most of the time I see people making the claim that a film is over-hyped due to the race of its creator, this is a dog-whistle argument against respect for black artists and against the movement in Hollywood (and elsewhere in cinema) to allow more space for black creativity. I'm not at all claiming that's your intention in making this thread (I think it's clear that it isn't), but even if not, I think there's a danger that this discussion is a way in for racist viewpoints."

The one thing I want to focus on is our inability to let black filmmakers make films that are not about being black or the black experience. Simply put, why can’t someone like Jordan Peele just make a genre film without the expectation that it will confront race? 

So, alongside white filmmakers (or white producers funding  black directors) making films that’s highlight black suffering and oppression, we also expect our favorite black filmmakers to make a statement in their art. It strikes me as unfair and I’ll even go as far as to say kind of racist. Studied this topic very briefly in school, but I’d be curious what anyone else thinks of this double standard that exists in American film"
7250,2020-08-11 14:37:48,i7q6hz,""" when the kid gloves will come off and people can honestly discuss black cinema ""

I think the question posed is actually the opposite. U.S. audiences are absurdly particular about the type of cinema we'll tolerate. Why is it that a film produced in the U.S. can be number one at the box office all over the world (China, India, Brazil, Mexico, etc) yet movies produced in other countries are don't top of the U.S. box office? It has nothing to do with quality. Numerous foreign films are identified as ones U.S. audiences would like and get remade.

Christopher Nolan's Insomnia in 02' was a remake of a Norwegian film which had just come out in 97'. Nolan's version was very fateful to the original. U.S. audiences watched Nolan's (in English with American actors) but wouldn't watch the original. This happens time and time again.  Martin Scorsese's The Departed in 06' is a remake of a Chinese movie which had just come out in 02'. U.S. audiences will not which movies less they are in English, contain American actors, American Music, etc. 

Remakes are not unique to the U.S.. Other nations make them as well. However the difference is in other nations audiences will watch international films. In the U.S. we won't. The most successful foreign movie of all time in the U.S. was Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon in in 00' (20yrs ago). It is the ONLY foreign film to ever make $100 million at the U.S. box office. Yet elsewhere in the world foreign film regular are hits. 19 of the 50 highest grossing films ever in China are U.S. produced films and one is Indian. In India its 6 of the top 50. The trend repeats all over. Meanwhile there isn't a single foreign movie in the U.S. top 300 much less multiple in the top 50. 

What does this have to do with Black Cinema (?)....U.S. audience do not seem willingly to watch culture (language, music, clothes, etc) which is not their own. To be success with U.S. audiences movies must meet specific cultural standards. This impacts all Black cinema. Black U.S. filmmakers must produce films that meet the cultural expectations of American audiences. For example one cannot name  any big successful films that had a protagonist who happened to be Muslim. Rather if one is Muslim in a film there faith must serve a purpose to the story. Likewise for gay protagonists. Exposition is required if one is something other than a hetro christian. I am not complaining, just point out there is a difference. 

As we have seen recently in the news most Americans aren't familiar with things like Juneteenth, events in Tulsa, etc. Exposition is required in a Black character in a film references HBCUs, kwanzaa, etc. Black filmmakers, who want to make successful movies, must couch their films standard American expectations of Black culture (stereotypes). Black movies with stories which don't go out of there way to make race an issue or define black culture for the audience simply don't get watched. Love Jones &  Inkwell were made by and starred black talent but were just simple stories that didn't make race an central issue. Few people bothered to watch. Spike Lee has attempted to make films where race isn't a factor (Inside Man, 25th Hour, Oldboy, etc) and they are among his least noticed. There is an expectation for Spike Lee that his films will acknowledge race and spotlight various veins. 

All of that to say I don't believe Black Cinema is approached with kids gloves. I believe it is constrained to specific expectations. In general American audiences are not open to different cultures. Black, Asian, Latino, Middle Eastern, etc people can be successful in American movies but must fit into specific niches. To reinforce this movies that fit the model get celebrated."
7251,2020-08-11 15:07:30,i7q6hz,"I think this is probably a thing that happens. I simply can not believe that *Black Is King* is the towering masterpiece of cinematic art many reviews have described it as. But I don't really see it as a problem for 'black cinema' per se, but as a potential problem for for cinema in general. When we begin to evaluate quality in art in terms of its relationship to a particular political narrative, it suggests to me there is a kind of creative crisis of confidence at play. If we were sure of what a 'good' or even 'great' film was, sure of our culture's ability to produce it, and sure of our ability to recognise it when we see it, we would not look to politics for guidance in these matters. When a majority culture feels impoverished, it tries to revive itself by feeding from the margins. So what you are describing may not be a problem at all, but an attempt to solve one."

If you feel some kind of pressure to tell your black friends how much you loved Blackkklansmen just because it and they are black, then I suggest you learn more about their culture and history so you can have an informed and nuanced discussion about the filmmakers who represent it, the stories they tell and the manner in which they tell them (and yes I fully appreciate the fact that you may be black, but my sentiment behind this comment still applies.)"

While it's impossible to prove one way or another, I think it's fair to explore the idea that much of the film's acclaim came from the desire to promote and uplift an ""important"" film about race that was directed by a black woman.

I did not see the Irishman but I did see Da 5 Bloods. During the initial 30 minutes I too found myself thinking the movie was overrated. However as it continued it made several very unique choices that I felt really warranted applause. 

Netflix is a different format than traditional cinema. Movies are often edited down and streamlined to fit within showtimes and maximize screens. Netflix however doesn't care about theater screens. Netflix doesn't mind longer movies. If marketed for theaters Da 5 Bloods probably would have had at least a quarter edited out of it. Instead it went further into character introspection than movies like it typically do. If one goes in expecting a snappy action movie they'll be disappointed. For me, I like that streaming services are providing a platform for filmmakers to expand a bit and not rush their storylines."

You state that American audiences are unwilling to watch foreign films whereas audiences in other countries are much more open to this.

I don't think this is correct. I think you need to consider what sort of foreign films international audiences are interested in - i.e. for the most part, they are specifically interested in *American* films (or at least films in English). I think this has more to do with the general pervasiveness of American culture throughout the world than any inherent open-mindedness that international audiences possess.

Look, for example, at this [List of highest-grossing films in France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films_in_France). Lots of American (and some British) movies, lots of French movies, but at first glance, I can't see *any* other languages represented.

7258,2020-08-11 16:20:33,i7q6hz,"> Why is it that a film produced in the U.S. can be number one at the box office all over the world

My hypothetical answer to that would be how often culturally and morally vanilla Hollywood films are.

They're essentially marked by some barbones WASP identity, occasionally replaced by a little milquetoast moralistic therapeutic deism and some cheering of neoliberal democracy or neoconservative intervensionism. 

So aside from the occasional backlash in some theocracic or authoritarian regime, they seem to have global ""appeal"" because the biggest Hollywood exports often do very little that remotely challenges or alienates their audience. They also have the advantage of a gigantic marketing apparatus behind them.

> Martin Scorsese's The Departed in 06' is a remake of a Chinese movie which had just come out in 02'

This is a good example, in my opinion, of a largely non-challenging film. The ending of *Infernal Affairs* is very grey and open-ended, whereas the ending of *The Departed* is the most vanilla-ass remake of the ending into the ""evil"" being ""punished.""

It's less ambiguous, less subtle, less interesting and generally less ambitious. At the risk of sounding like an elitist asshole, I think that also has the upside of possibly making it more appealing to general audiences.

> However the difference is in other nations audiences will watch international films. 

Is this really true? I'm all for shitting on American tastes, but I don't think this is that accurate. 

The ten biggest markets by box office revenue are:

1. USA: Top 25 of 2019 is all Hollywood
2. China: 8 Hollywood, other 17 are Chinese
3. India: 12 Hollywood, 13 are Indian
4. Japan: 14 Hollywood, 11 are Japanese.
5. United Kingdom, 21 Hollywood, 4 British
6. South Korea: 10 Hollywood, 15 Korean
7. France: 19 Hollywood, 6 French
8. Germany: 21 Hollywood, 3 German, 1 French
9. Russia: 22 Hollywood, 3 Russian
10. Australia: 22 Hollywood, 2, British, 1 Australian

So yes, most countries watch ""international"" movies, in the flavor of Hollywood stuff, for sure. But Japanese filmgoers are not lining up to see [The Battle: Roar to Victory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Battle:_Roar_to_Victory), and British viewers aren't exactly clamoring for [Wolf Warrior 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf_Warrior_2).

The careers of John Singleton and Ernest R Dickerson didn’t quite take off after mesmerizing debuts, and I recall their subsequent movies getting lukewarm critical reviews.

What you describe with “black cinema” is in sharp contrast with music, where in the early 90s when Billboard started counting record sales through electronic scans as opposed to what record stores told them, Billboard found out to their shock that rap/hip-hop albums were actually topping the sales charts and mostly sold in white suburbs.

I do not know for sure what explains the contrast, however it does seem that in the late 80s and early 90s the mainstream music that white majority America listened to was going through a period of decline, particularly the derivative “hair rock” bands of that time following the then recent demise of new wave rock. Along with the cultural legacy of black musicians since the Civil War period, Louis Armstrong, Count Basie, Marian Anderson, Robert Johnson, Miles Davis, Ornette Coleman, Billie Holiday, Tina Turner, Little Richard, Aretha Franklin, Michael Jackson, Prince, just to name a few, in a way that has not been anywhere near as accessible to black filmmakers."

This strikes me as a myopic way to view art. All art is from a particular place and time, and cannot be understood without that context. It's perfectly valid to say that something is ""good"" art because it engages with contemporary ideas, including political ones.

It's not particularly controversial to say that books like *Frankenstein* and *Crime and Punishment* are considered masterpieces precisely because of (amongst other things) the way they engaged with contemporary scientific and philosophical thought.

Get Out while maybe just as meaningful, was so much more concise and clear about what it was doing. The jumpsuits, the weird differences between the doppelgangers and the family, the rabbits, the arm chain, and the secret bunker were just too much all at once that it made the movie feel like a knot that, in my opinion, isn't worth the frustration of unwinding. Get Out isn't great because it makes a statement on race, It's great because it makes a statement that people can see and relate to period. Us is not near as effective.

When I write “our” I’m speaking of the moviegoing public, I felt like that was fairly obvious but perhaps I need to clarify that. Obviously I don’t mean everyone, but I do feel as though there’s a tendency to value black works that deal with race higher than other works by black creators, especially works that deal with black suffering. 

I brought up Jordan Peele because I think he’s likely the most popular black filmmaker in America at the moment. The quality of his work is besides the point, so my or your opinion on his films really doesn’t matter to the grander point I was making. I do still disagree on your point about his writing though, I think Get Out was a particularly well written film that I think benefits from examining under a non-race related lens. You can of course view race as topic explored in the film, but I’d argue our tendency to want to do that (as almost every critic did) proves my point. Get Out is basically a genre film, so why is that not a common reading (I’ve had people argue with me that it’s not a horror film despite it explicitly being one). Did we place such a high expectation on Peele to the point where him just making shit isn’t enough? 

That background context was interesting though. I became fascinated by this topic while studying some of Michael Boyd Gillespies writing. I’d have to brush up on his work again, but his book Film Blackness I found to be a great read.

The recording industry responded by buying out the indie labels that produced these guys and then squeezed distribution, killing off the local record stores.  In the late 90’s and early 00’s, if you couldn’t get a distribution deal through a major record company through Walmart, your CD died

The roles were reversed. Black people inhabited whites and rather a psychological method they used old country voodoo. Get Out wasn't original as many praise it as being. 

Get Out's story was more linear than Us. The audience wasn't asked to accept as much supernatural stuff. Performance wise Lupita Nyong'o was sensational in Us. Lupita's performance out shined any individual performance from Get Out. The cinematography in Us was more interesting as well. Because Us wasn't as grounded in reality Peele used more abstract imagery. Get out was overall a better movie by the numbers but the artistic flares of Us made it as interesting in my opinion."

A full Black cast in a film is uncommon. As such it primes the audience to expect something different. The choice to use Black actor always seems purposeful.

Sure. But your original point was that **""other nations audiences will watch international films.""** And my quibble is not that the USA isn't dominated by Hollywood movies (it **absolutely** is), but that your wording was a misleading way to frame the difference in international box offices. 

If we're classifying ""international films"" as a given market being open to Hollywood productions (which are films that *already* purposefully catered towards the *lowest* common denominator possible and are created with as *wide* of a *global* reach as possible in mind), then fine the claim is accurate. 

And I agree that the idea that American box office does ""not seem willingly to watch culture (language, music, clothes, etc) which is not their own"" makes for a fairly substantive claim. But my point was that it's not as though other nations are some kind of culturally erudite paradises where foreign films of **many** national and cultural origins flourish.

To me, the fact that the French turned out in chart-setting numbers for *The Lion King*, *Frozen II* and *Avengers: Endgame* says less about some kind of French cultural open-mindness and **more about the vanilla cultural appeal of Hollywood.**

> That would remain true if you expanded it out to the top 100

I mean, I'm not going to do this for every market [but a quick cursory look of Japan's Top 100 tells you the box office is a complicated reality.](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/2019/?area=JP&ref_=bo_wew_table_2)

The Top 100 is *entirely* Japanese and Hollywood movies except for a *single* Italian movie down at \#89. So yes, they're open to ""international films"" **specifically in the form of Hollywood movies.** But that's it. There's no representation of Chinese cinema, nothing South Korean, French, German, Mexican or anything else in there. An occasional movie or two like the Italian one might flit on towards the bottom of the chart, but that's probably it.

And just for fun, take the Top 10 Japanese movies from last year. There are some that made decent money outside of Japan (almost all anime and/or based on popular manga franchises) like *Weathering with You*, *One Piece: Stampede* or *Detective Conan*, and then there's stuff that most countries will never hear of. *Kingdom* was the 9th highest gross last year at around $50 million domestic and it only made $170k internationally. *Masquerade Hotel* was 12th at $39 million and it made $1 million internationally. *Fly Me to the Saitama* was 13th at $33 million and *Hit Me Anyone One More Time!* was 14th at $32 million, and both made $0 internationally. 

Again, my quibble here is not that Americans (particularly WASPs) aren't culturally close-minded, because I agree that they generally are. My quibble is that *many* (if not most) countries are culturally preferential in their entertainment choices, and the reason Hollywood movies flourish is *because they are so culturally vanilla as to escape any cultural preferences*."

We can let the others, go by the wayside, but since the others are part of ""Us"", ignoring their plights will eventually and inevitably drag down ""me and mine"" alongside them."
7280,2020-08-11 15:27:40,i7q6hz,"I prefer Us to Get Out, but I think you're nuts if you think it's just a horror movie without a bigger message about class dynamics and privilege behind it. It's not 1 to 1 specifically about race, but it's not far off."
7281,2020-08-11 17:54:06,i7q6hz,I don't understand your distinction. Any non-Domestically produced film in the U.S. is considered a FORIEGN FILM. Why should it be any different for China and India. Movies produced outside of those countries staring actors that speak a different language and are of different nationalities to them are successful at the box office. It is something which doesn't exist here in the States but does exist everywhere else. You seem to be arguing that because it is majority American films it doesn't count for some reason. I don't follow the logic.
7282,2020-08-11 18:07:16,i7q6hz,"""Peele has repeatedly said that “Us” is not about race, shattering any expectations of fans prepping for a “Get Out” sequel, or a film that exists in a similar universe. “Scores of people will walk into this movie waiting for the racial commentary, and when it doesn’t come in the form they’re looking for, they’ll be forced to ask themselves: ‘Why did I think a movie with black people had to be about blackness?'” he said in one interview. That realization may provide an opportunity for self-reflection and eventually a change in perception.""

""“On the broader strokes of things, this movie is about this country,” Peele said during the Q&A after the film’s SXSW premiere. “We are our own worst enemy.” And if audiences do want to see “Us” as a movie about race, that reaction may say more about their own assumptions than anything Peele himself is bringing to the table.""

7283,2020-08-11 19:23:03,i7q6hz,"Sometimes cool imagery is just cool imagery. I agree that the film wanted to say something, but I’d say first and foremost it was meant to be a good, fun horror flick. Get Out was a movie based around a message that just happened to be playing in the horror sandbox.

Plenty of fun horror movies have something to say, but whether or not the message is the point is an entirely different story."
7284,2020-08-11 17:14:56,i7q6hz,"Yeah it was about privilege and class, its the main thematic element to the movie. I dont see how someone couldn't get that."
7285,2020-08-11 20:32:58,i7q6hz,"> I don't understand your distinction.

The distinction I'm making is the same thing that /u/AMPenguin brought up:

> I don't think this is correct. I think you need to consider what sort of foreign films international audiences are interested in - i.e. for the most part, **they are specifically interested in American films** (or at least films in English). I think this has more to do with the general pervasiveness of American culture throughout the world than any inherent open-mindedness that international audiences possess.

Yes, obviously, an American movie is a foreign film outside of the USA. 

The the point I was making is that this claim ""other nations audiences will watch international films"" is too broad. Respective global markets primarily watch **their own nation's films** and **American films**. That's it. They are not some kind of ""citizens of the world"" that will consume stuff from around the globe, they're merely consuming industrial, corporate Hollywood products. 

And again, this does not speak (to me) to some kind of cultural openmindness of the Germans or Koreans and some openness to ""language, music, clothes"" which are not their own.

It speaks to the **cultural hegemony** that Hollywood and American culture has on marketing, cultural consciousness and the worldwide movie industry, which **I** am arguing is at least *partially* due to the generally vanilla cultural politics of Hollywood films. 

It's the movie industry equivalent of the common cliche about America exporting its blue jeans, rock and roll and fast food. In that regard, American films are part of a global culture that America has exported, so to many audiences *these films do not feel that foreign to them*. If the Marvel Cinematic Universe was some uniquely, bleeding Red-White-and-Blue franchise, it might not have gained the traction that it did. But comics, superheroes and their fandoms have been exported around the world for decades. So global markets are not consuming something that feels considerably ""foreign"" and outside of their ""language, music, clothes,"" but that of a more global brand that *does* feel familiar. Movie markets around the globe import American movies because of that cultural hegemony and familiarity. 

In easy comparison, even though China has a huge movie industry, the world is (generally) not adopting say, Chinese movies. [*My People, My Country*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_People,_My_Country) was a movie that commemorated the 70th anniversary of the founding of the PRC. It was a roaring success in China. Was it a success anywhere else? No. It made $446 million in China and barely $1.5 million outside of China. Why? **Because just like American's aversion to ""language, music, clothes"" that are not their own, the rest of the world generally has that aversion to distinct appreciation of Chinese culture and government.** And the same goes for distinctly Japanese, or Korean, or French, or Brazilian or Russian movies.

I'm not disagreeing with the substance of your critique (American aversion to ""outsider"" culture). I'm merely adding on that this is a global problem, **and that it is reflected in the *global* dearth of appreciation and growth in Black cinema.**"
7286,2020-08-12 01:16:52,i7q6hz,"I never insinuated that it was about race, only that I think it was clearly meant to have a metaphorical meaning that I think got lost a little bit. I don't think the race of the characters has any bearing on any of that."
7287,2020-08-11 20:53:12,i7q6hz,"That and the amount of money they are willing to spend on advertising to overseas markets. Living a part of my youth in Latin America, I saw generic action movies starring Franco Nero (Italy), Jackie Chan (China) or Jorge Porcel (Argentina) be among the highest-grossing of the year when the studios/distributors marketed them well."
7288,2020-08-11 20:37:36,i7q6hz,"Again, other Nations are watching international movies. It you are in Germany a movie made in Hollywood USA is an international film. It just is. That is a fact."
7289,2020-08-12 12:42:39,i7q6hz,"The 2005 movie Skeleton Key was similar to Get Out. Only the roles are reversed. A Black couple who'd been oppressed on a plantation take the bodies the family that run the plantation. All the same metaphors exist and racial dynamics exist in Skeleton Key as they do in Get Out. Yet Skeleton Key wasn't celebrated for it vision, message, depth, of extra. It was just a horror movie most forgot about. 

Skeleton Key starred Kat Hudson and was produced by white filmmakers. No one was anticipating racial insights so all the references and metaphors went unnoticed. It is all an expectation thing. People go into Black movies looking for the metaphors, looking for the racial components, etc. Sometimes they are there and sometimes they aren't."
7290,2020-08-11 21:00:05,i7q6hz,"Unfortunately, (and this could be my own perception!) it feels like companies have become less able or willing to spend deftly on international marketing in recent years. You have little global flashes in the pan like say, Parasite, but it gets harder and harder as we've seen Hollywood companies (e.g. Disney buying everyone) converge into bigger and bigger international, multinational behemoths with more and more money to bully with."
7291,2020-08-11 20:45:09,i7q6hz,"> Again, other Nations are watching international movies. 

Other nations are watching **one specific type of international movies.** Corporate, industrial Hollywood products. That's it. They're not havens for ""international"" films, they're havens for American cultural hegemony. That's all that's being argued.

I don't think you're capable of understanding the argument being made about cultural projection and aversions, so I'm just going to drop this. It's going in pointless circles."
7292,2020-08-10 10:46:56,i72jr5,"Nah, people like different shit."
7293,2020-08-10 11:29:18,i72jr5,I tend to cringe more when drew recommends schitts creek over and over
7294,2020-08-10 15:24:44,i72jr5,You're surprised she likes a super cringe over the top ridiculous  comedy ?

I also think he's one of the best at ""there's no where to shoot, hit the pads and get a juicy rebound for someone in the slot"" because that happens a lot too

His passing is also super underrated - he doesn't have well over 500 assists by accident - it's just that his shot is *so* lethal it overshadows some of the rest of his offensive game."

I was impressed when it was just Oval Office, but be has now shot four entire TV seasons since July 7th. 82 episodes over 32 shooting days, while also maintaining a safe shooting space with extensive testing and quarantine.

7495,2020-09-07 00:46:19,inuyf5,"Nothing looks crisp. Whiffing on pass attempts, missing the net, not establishing any semblance of a forecheck, etc."
7496,2020-09-07 00:56:33,inuyf5,Looks like they're starting to wake up
7497,2020-09-07 00:57:28,inuyf5,"Well, that was better play towards the end of the period. They are adjusting to the fact that they just can't out-muscle this team the way they did Vancouver."
7498,2020-09-07 01:12:48,inuyf5,"[Pics for proof because you asked for it] (https://imgur.com/a/t7Juhl3)

I moved my jersey here for the round robin while cleaning and this is where it has been all playoffs."
7499,2020-09-07 01:22:18,inuyf5,🌺🐽🌺
7500,2020-09-07 01:25:31,inuyf5,We look fucking suck.
7501,2020-09-07 01:25:42,inuyf5,Did we transform into the Canucks??? What is this
7502,2020-09-07 01:26:34,inuyf5,Zero SOG in the second period
7503,2020-09-07 01:44:47,inuyf5,woulda been cool if Nate could have made that one
7504,2020-09-07 01:57:02,inuyf5,Hopefully this PP is massive and not like all the others which have been the size of my PP. Big PPs only please.
7505,2020-09-07 02:09:37,inuyf5,The DJ is playing the wrong P!ATD song. I want to hear “Vegas Lights”
7506,2020-09-07 02:16:44,inuyf5,Patches fan damn
7507,2020-09-07 02:27:40,inuyf5,We are only down one point. And we have spent a lot of time on offense this period. We can still do this.
7508,2020-09-07 01:53:17,inuyf5,I’m disappointed in the lack of Jam memes considering Fleury is in net
7509,2020-09-07 01:53:42,inuyf5,"There be trolls around. 
Don't feed them. Don't get into a meaningless ""discussion"".
Focus on the task at hand."
7510,2020-09-06 23:47:30,inuyf5,LETS FUCKING GOOOOOO KNIGHTS
7511,2020-09-07 00:03:54,inuyf5,Pierre looks like a hairy big toe
7512,2020-09-07 00:15:00,inuyf5,Casual Reavo looking like a snack
7513,2020-09-07 00:16:13,inuyf5,"Imagine you wanted to watch hockey


But nbc said


No"
7514,2020-09-07 00:17:52,inuyf5,Man. I can’t believe we’re here again. Feels like so long ago but not at all. Life is crazy
7515,2020-09-07 00:26:19,inuyf5,"We’re getting out-skated right now, and I’m not liking the look of this so far"
7516,2020-09-07 00:30:58,inuyf5,Damn this is really bad. We’re just shoveling the puck out not even trying to formulate an offense. Team still can’t fucking shoot
7517,2020-09-07 00:32:28,inuyf5,"Obviously not the start we wanted but it makes me think if this Stars speed threat is just an adrenaline dump. I see us playing our game, somewhat and just have to weather the storm. I cant see them staying up with our eventual grind"
7518,2020-09-07 00:33:51,inuyf5,"My fear right now is that following the loss of his dad, this Vegas drama has just solidly taken the wind out of Fleury.

That said, I’ll never stop believing 🤷‍♀️"
7519,2020-09-07 00:36:00,inuyf5,Damn 🗿 might’ve lost some tooth
7520,2020-09-07 00:39:14,inuyf5,Reaver is watching and taking notes
7521,2020-09-07 00:48:14,inuyf5,Stone is getting beat up
7522,2020-09-07 00:49:14,inuyf5,Hope that Stars dude is good. It didn't look like too hard of a hit though so I'm not sure what happened to him
7523,2020-09-07 00:51:11,inuyf5,Marchy has been a giveaway machine lately.
7524,2020-09-07 00:51:30,inuyf5,"Oh hey look, a forecheck!"
7525,2020-09-07 00:55:51,inuyf5,We have as many icings as shots on goal
7526,2020-09-07 00:58:00,inuyf5,Let's get an adjustment at intermission and come out strong in the second. Go Knights Go!
7527,2020-09-07 01:22:05,inuyf5,No PPs allowed tonight I guess
7528,2020-09-07 01:30:54,inuyf5,Schmidt needs to shoot that he was open.
7529,2020-09-07 01:31:14,inuyf5,🌸!
7530,2020-09-07 01:36:59,inuyf5,"Smith just got owned.  
Need to fix that."
7531,2020-09-07 01:43:49,inuyf5,I see we are continuing with the shooting into the chest strategy.
7532,2020-09-07 01:46:00,inuyf5,Another bad clear attempt by Shea wtf
7533,2020-09-07 01:48:30,inuyf5,Wild Bill. I'm ready
7534,2020-09-07 01:49:03,inuyf5,This team is literally wasting our time
7535,2020-09-07 02:00:51,inuyf5,I’m stuck at work. How do we only have 12 shots on goal? Bad passing or are they just shutting us down?
7536,2020-09-07 02:11:54,inuyf5,We will win this
7537,2020-09-07 02:12:03,inuyf5,Sucks so much ass right now that Fleury only has a .957 save percentage. Get that bum off the ice.
7538,2020-09-07 02:12:48,inuyf5,I believe that we can win
7539,2020-09-07 02:15:03,inuyf5,*BLESS THAT RIGHT PAD*
7540,2020-09-07 02:20:46,inuyf5,"If we give Doby a pair of socks, would that distract him enough to let a puck sneak by?"
7541,2020-09-07 02:22:21,inuyf5,Stars starting to look tired now. Gotta out work them.
7542,2020-09-07 02:38:30,inuyf5,"Backloaded our bad games with the Nucks and looks like we frontloaded our bad game with the Stars. Either way, we looked competitive at the end. We got this."
7543,2020-09-07 02:41:26,inuyf5,We definitely need to fix the entire offense.  Tired of seeing Martinez and Schmidt shoot all the time at the goalie’s chest.
7544,2020-09-07 02:52:05,inuyf5,Fun fact: the New Jersey Devils and Detroit Redwings scored the same amount of goals as us tonight
7545,2020-09-07 02:52:49,inuyf5,"In all fairness, in addition to our early game woes, the puck luck was all Dallass tonight.  Ever pinball puck landed on a Stars stick it seemed."
7546,2020-09-07 01:08:22,inuyf5,"Not a goal Flower would like to give up early, but he got better as the period went on. Tough spot for getting the start in game 1 of the conference final after not playing in so long.

The rest of the team started improving their play late in the period. That unforced error at blue line by Martinez hurt because it looked like we had something going then. 

Going forward, we've just gotta put passes on the tape which will eliminate all of those icings, stay out of the box and finish instead of missing the damn net. Life is too comfy for Khudobin right now."
7547,2020-09-07 01:47:48,inuyf5,Should that not have been a PS?
7548,2020-09-07 01:47:49,inuyf5,Should be a penalty shot
7549,2020-09-07 01:29:56,inuyf5,Just saying we're undefeated in games where I get Reddit gold.
7550,2020-09-07 01:32:30,inuyf5,"Starting to see some spark and some chances, just gotta keep this up"
7551,2020-09-06 23:56:44,inuyf5,"Sick 'em high

Sick 'em low

Sick 'em where the sun don't show

#Go Knights Go!"
7552,2020-09-06 23:56:58,inuyf5,There is going to be so much good hockey in this series. These teams are both very gritty and talented. Both are excellent teams and I am so happy we got this match up.
7553,2020-09-06 23:57:40,inuyf5,"Omg I'm loving these local commercials with Schmidt, Karlsson, etc. Amazing.

Beats five dollar footlong, at least..."
7554,2020-09-07 00:10:23,inuyf5,I guess there’s no need to start the 4th line without Reavo in the lineup
7555,2020-09-07 00:15:16,inuyf5,Reavo looking quite dapper 😳
7556,2020-09-07 00:18:28,inuyf5,omg fleurys mustache makes him look like an evil version of himself 🤦‍♀️
7557,2020-09-07 00:28:51,inuyf5,Stars play a fast and physical game when on point. We need to be prepped for that and get some good hits in...
7558,2020-09-07 00:32:29,inuyf5,Shea boutta tie this game up
7559,2020-09-07 00:35:08,inuyf5,"I could be wrong, but we're spending far too much time in our defensive zone."
7560,2020-09-07 00:35:52,inuyf5,Shit. Stone in the locker room
7561,2020-09-07 00:42:31,inuyf5,Well that's one way to kill a PP...
7562,2020-09-07 00:42:46,inuyf5,"Vegas: have a PP

Dallas: nah bro"
7563,2020-09-07 00:42:59,inuyf5,Is it weird that I like our 5v4 PK over 4v4?
7564,2020-09-07 00:43:03,inuyf5,Great PK boys
7565,2020-09-07 00:46:57,inuyf5,You’d think this was a back to back the way they’re moving
7566,2020-09-07 00:48:09,inuyf5,We can't keep the puck out of our side. Fuck.
7567,2020-09-07 00:51:29,inuyf5,We're starting to bang back and win board battles
7568,2020-09-07 01:04:15,inuyf5,Oof this games making me happy Cody “bones made of” Glass isn’t playing and that whitecloud can take a beating
7569,2020-09-07 01:19:33,inuyf5,NEED A BIG PP
7570,2020-09-07 01:22:43,inuyf5,WE NEED **BOOSTER JUICE!**
7571,2020-09-07 01:26:48,inuyf5,Just doesn’t look like we can control the puck at all. Need to get our heads together
7572,2020-09-07 01:28:14,inuyf5,"Hey, I think it's hard to score without shooting the puck, but I'm not a professional hockeyman."
7573,2020-09-07 01:28:24,inuyf5,Fuck now my smoke detector started chirping.
7574,2020-09-07 01:28:54,inuyf5,We used up our shot allotment against Vancouver. Now we're going through austerity.
7575,2020-09-07 01:29:24,inuyf5,Aight that looked good. More of that with a dash of scoring please
7576,2020-09-07 01:29:45,inuyf5,"Nice hit by Cousins. Can't hit the net, but apparently he can hit Stars"
7577,2020-09-07 01:30:44,inuyf5,Glass needs to just gain 10 pounds of muscle and just practice faceoffs for 5 months. I'm sick being shit on on faceoffs
7578,2020-09-07 01:30:47,inuyf5,"Some flashes of VGK hockey here, including Marche fanning on a shot"
7579,2020-09-07 01:37:34,inuyf5,Well that was sad.
7580,2020-09-07 01:43:01,inuyf5,We said “40 SOG curse lets get less than 40” we just gotta make those count
7581,2020-09-07 01:43:42,inuyf5,I want a VGK goal pls
7582,2020-09-07 01:45:35,inuyf5,Bad clear by Shea
7583,2020-09-07 01:46:31,inuyf5,There’s 🗿!
7584,2020-09-07 01:47:39,inuyf5,I love that NBC is realizing that the game is so boring that they can just shove a commercial in there during a faceoff without a media break.
7585,2020-09-07 01:48:20,inuyf5,Let’s get a whole PP to ourselves please. No sharing
7586,2020-09-07 01:48:43,inuyf5,Wtf is going on
7587,2020-09-07 01:49:38,inuyf5,Only down 1. We're still in this. I for one am ready to experience third period VGK hockey
7588,2020-09-07 02:10:20,inuyf5,Carrier down into their zone and literally nobody else in there with him when he needs to pass.
7589,2020-09-07 02:15:01,inuyf5,ALL HAIL THE RIGHT PAD
7590,2020-09-07 02:15:27,inuyf5,Hot take - we will score on this PP
7591,2020-09-07 02:17:24,inuyf5,RIP Theodore’s stick
7592,2020-09-07 02:19:33,inuyf5,Schmitty hitting dead center every fucking time. Sign him up for the next Suicide Squad movie.
7593,2020-09-07 02:26:23,inuyf5,Can't connect on a pass
7594,2020-09-07 02:37:44,inuyf5,"Despite the whole, ‘Fleury didnt deserve that loss’, my money is on them riding Lehner from here on out."
7595,2020-09-07 00:12:27,inuyf5,Between the pandemic and changing careers and getting engaged: it feels like a lifetime ago we were in the Western Finals but it was just two years
7596,2020-09-07 00:13:43,inuyf5,How about we drop a fucking puck
7597,2020-09-07 00:52:58,inuyf5,"Please beat these guys. Beat the hell out of them. I really can’t stand the stars. They are dirty, dirty little bitches. - a sad CO fan"
7598,2020-09-07 01:50:54,inuyf5,Oof. So Reavo is our talisman I guess.
7599,2020-09-07 02:20:52,inuyf5,WHERES THE HOLDING CALL!
7600,2020-09-07 02:21:49,inuyf5,"Flyers fan coming in saying I’m rooting for you guys hard, such a fun team to watch."
7601,2020-09-07 02:25:24,inuyf5,To be fair. We have almost caught up on SoG. Seems like we are playing a little better Than the first 2 periods.
7602,2020-09-07 00:01:16,inuyf5,"Schmidty, I don't want a Hyundai!

Yay we get Fleury!!

LETS GO KNIGHTS!!!"
7603,2020-09-07 00:09:30,inuyf5,"Bless the flower, eat the jam!!!!"
7604,2020-09-07 00:12:59,inuyf5,REALLY? Matt balldestroyer Dumba?!

7606,2020-09-07 00:17:54,inuyf5,KIGHT!
7607,2020-09-07 00:21:13,inuyf5,I love Khudobin’s mask with Dobby the elf
7608,2020-09-07 00:25:10,inuyf5,3 on 2 🤦🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️
7609,2020-09-07 00:25:29,inuyf5,Don’t like that
7610,2020-09-07 00:31:26,inuyf5,"The Stars are fast. And here for a reason. 
On the flip side, so are we. 
So, whatcha do about it??"
7611,2020-09-07 00:32:10,inuyf5,Let the guys settle down. We're not even 10 minutes into the 1st period of game one.
7612,2020-09-07 00:35:08,inuyf5,Getting absolutely bullied out there
7613,2020-09-07 00:37:42,inuyf5,PDB needs to check them
7614,2020-09-07 00:39:59,inuyf5,Muffin Man got his Muffin Mask!
7615,2020-09-07 00:40:58,inuyf5,This team is playing soft as fuck right now. No way all our physicality is because of a reaves
7616,2020-09-07 00:41:26,inuyf5,We gotta speed it up
7617,2020-09-07 00:42:55,inuyf5,Don’t you dare start pavelski
7618,2020-09-07 00:42:58,inuyf5,What a shit penalty lol
7619,2020-09-07 00:44:02,inuyf5,🌸
7620,2020-09-07 00:46:00,inuyf5,"what was going on, on the dallas bench, with that guy's hand?"
7621,2020-09-07 00:47:37,inuyf5,A Tuch Goal would be real cool rn :)
7622,2020-09-07 00:48:15,inuyf5,"For being the more physical team, Dallas sure is getting hurt a lot"
7623,2020-09-07 00:48:36,inuyf5,Chandler with the Charlie horse lol
7624,2020-09-07 00:49:33,inuyf5,The boys just look tired out there.
7625,2020-09-07 00:54:18,inuyf5,Cousins getting great chances tonight
7626,2020-09-07 00:54:31,inuyf5,That “FUCK” by Cousins was perfect
7627,2020-09-07 00:54:49,inuyf5,Damn Cuzz x2
7628,2020-09-07 00:55:07,inuyf5,"I'd like one of those shots to go, please. We've been so snakebitten when it comes to the greasy stuff."
7629,2020-09-07 00:55:47,inuyf5,We're finally getting our legs
7630,2020-09-07 00:58:47,inuyf5,FIQ: What's your favorite Zelda game?
7631,2020-09-07 01:14:03,inuyf5,OK I put on deodorant so hopefully that should help the boys even the scoreboard!
7632,2020-09-07 01:20:36,inuyf5,Well that’s not fun.
7633,2020-09-07 01:21:10,inuyf5,imagine if the whole series goes like this with PP's
7634,2020-09-07 01:21:36,inuyf5,REFS CAN SUCK A FAT DICK
7635,2020-09-07 01:21:37,inuyf5,Ticky tac bullshit
7636,2020-09-07 01:24:15,inuyf5,"Hollly shit I thought that was going in, PHEW"
7637,2020-09-07 01:27:32,inuyf5,We need to get some momentum going ASAP
7638,2020-09-07 01:28:26,inuyf5,That hit was nice. Could be a momentum shift. Need that.
7639,2020-09-07 01:28:27,inuyf5,Now Shea can't keep it in the zone either 🤦🏽‍♂️
7640,2020-09-07 01:34:47,inuyf5,Has anyone seen stone?
7641,2020-09-07 01:40:14,inuyf5,Lehner looking like he's watching intently and studying what the Stars are doing to get ready to play against them. Was pretty cool to see. Sometimes you see the backup goalie just kind of sitting there not engaged.
7642,2020-09-07 01:40:43,inuyf5,🌺🌺
7643,2020-09-07 01:40:56,inuyf5,I just puckered half my undies into my ass
7644,2020-09-07 01:41:25,inuyf5,Okay we need more shots on goal.
7645,2020-09-07 01:41:35,inuyf5,"What the hell happened there!? Looked like Whitecloud was trying to took it past Flower lol. Chaos.

EDIT: Whitecloud fell over him after the puck went past the post off the back of his stick."
7646,2020-09-07 01:43:40,inuyf5,"So we can't exit our zone cleanly, dallas is taking away the neutral zone and forcing us to play dump and chase, and they're winning a lot of those board battles. Idk what to do to fix that, and that's why I'm not an NHL coach. But deboer is, so hopefully he's got something."
7647,2020-09-07 01:43:48,inuyf5,I'd love to see a heat map of where are shots are in relation to the net/goalie. I swear the middle of the goalie's chest would be as bright as the sun
7648,2020-09-07 01:44:08,inuyf5,I see we still don’t know how to shoot anywhere but the chest
7649,2020-09-07 01:46:22,inuyf5,Stone sighting!
7650,2020-09-07 01:47:14,inuyf5,Can we get a real PP now?
7651,2020-09-07 01:47:45,inuyf5,really thought the ref was just gonna let that slide
7652,2020-09-07 01:48:33,inuyf5,Not a promising start to this PP.
7653,2020-09-07 01:49:43,inuyf5,3rd period energy is coming up.  Starting with the pp!
7654,2020-09-07 02:00:26,inuyf5,"Calling out u/foothill2004. Seems his reddit account has been hijacked by a 10 year old.

8160,2020-09-07 01:13:09,inuyf5,I put on yoga pants to go to the grocery store but they seemed unnecessary after that so my fiance came out of the den to me cooking steak in just a sweater and my VGK flair 🤷. I say embrace that holiday weekend life
8161,2020-09-07 01:35:27,inuyf5,I mean I saw him maybe once after he went in the locker that’s about it
8162,2020-09-07 01:35:27,inuyf5,\*ouch\*
8163,2020-09-07 01:58:30,inuyf5,oh guaranteed
8164,2020-09-07 01:52:59,inuyf5,Only because of Fleury tbh. Defense has looked absolutely weak.
8165,2020-09-07 01:53:02,inuyf5,We've proven the most dangerous thing a team can do to us these playoffs is take a lead against us.
8166,2020-09-07 02:04:06,inuyf5,"> my wife's boyfriend

What?"
8167,2020-09-07 02:03:24,inuyf5,Well that sucks you have to...wait..wife's what...?
8168,2020-09-07 02:03:45,inuyf5,poly works for some people but definitely not for me so best of fucking luck with that one. We love having you here when you can drop by.
8169,2020-09-07 02:08:29,inuyf5,...did you get married and just never mention it to me or is this copy pasta?
8170,2020-09-07 02:34:51,inuyf5,"Some little aliens are running around with Stone, Patches and Tuch’s goal scoring abilities, Space Jam style"
8171,2020-09-07 02:35:33,inuyf5,Exactly what I'm beginning to think.
8172,2020-09-07 00:29:09,inuyf5,"No, no we don't. No jump in our step right now"
8173,2020-09-07 01:26:41,inuyf5,neither is the zero for goals we're sitting at
8174,2020-09-07 01:27:11,inuyf5,It's Subban's
8175,2020-09-07 01:57:24,inuyf5,if I were them I'd be stuffing my face with carbs
8176,2020-09-07 02:05:36,inuyf5,So basically Malcom Subban? :)
8177,2020-09-07 02:05:14,inuyf5,So Carey Price? :p
8178,2020-09-07 02:20:47,inuyf5,He needs some milk
8179,2020-09-07 02:25:00,inuyf5,We've got this in the 4th period. Not a doubt in my mind.
8180,2020-09-07 02:28:09,inuyf5,"How soon? Like, this game soon? Or Jesus is coming quickly soon?"
8181,2020-09-07 02:28:23,inuyf5,Yes
8182,2020-09-07 02:31:05,inuyf5,Drink every time he passes to his imaginary teammate.
8183,2020-09-07 00:45:35,inuyf5,">fuck everything about Pavelski, Benn, and Corey fucking Perry 


Are you trying to hit it? Cause you're doing a good job"
8184,2020-09-07 00:45:46,inuyf5,Fuck Corey Perry. All my homies hate Corey Perry
8185,2020-09-07 00:46:32,inuyf5,Were the Stars this physical in your series? I must not have been watching close enough.
8186,2020-09-06 23:18:19,inuyf5,"This is TERRIFIC news. 

How's the dog's record so far?"
8187,2020-09-06 23:40:31,inuyf5,"Three-syllable ""Conference"".

I'll accept it."

Round 3 and ready to fight 

We are dynamic!"
8189,2020-09-07 00:02:08,inuyf5,Lmao watch the stars bring in their third string and deja vuuu
8190,2020-09-07 00:02:49,inuyf5,His saves still haunt my nightmares.
8191,2020-09-07 00:07:45,inuyf5,😍😍😍😍
8192,2020-09-07 00:58:37,inuyf5,Maybe we had our classic season 3 playoff second period in the first period?
8193,2020-09-07 01:04:20,inuyf5,Ferda 👊🏻
8194,2020-09-07 01:03:59,inuyf5,I dont want to go to a parade when its 117
8195,2020-09-07 01:13:09,inuyf5,there's a pandemic.
8196,2020-09-07 01:37:52,inuyf5,I hope so
8197,2020-09-07 01:53:30,inuyf5,"I feel like if we aren't actively in the lead folks act like we're falling apart. No team plays three perfect periods every night, and no team wins every game.

But we're gonna win this one so it's moot"
8198,2020-09-07 00:18:00,inuyf5,Whatcha got against Dumba??
8199,2020-09-07 00:19:07,inuyf5,I bellowed DUMBA when they listed the nominees and then had to explain why to my kid
8200,2020-09-07 00:29:05,inuyf5,I do like the Tuch skating.
8201,2020-09-07 00:36:35,inuyf5,For. Real.
8202,2020-09-07 00:57:41,inuyf5,hell to the yeah!
8203,2020-09-07 00:59:05,inuyf5,I tried my best ok :(
8204,2020-09-07 01:08:47,inuyf5,I like this narrative better than that they are tired because they just got out of a seven game series with only one day off.
8205,2020-09-07 01:06:29,inuyf5,Deboers account?
8206,2020-09-07 01:13:08,inuyf5,Proof that without Reaves we are a slower skating team
8207,2020-09-07 01:43:18,inuyf5,NBC never stopped shitting on us

8214,2020-09-07 02:34:14,inuyf5,I'd prefer to do it before the empty net comes into play to save myself of the heart attack but I'll take one for the team if it means we tie it up
8215,2020-09-07 01:59:04,inuyf5,"But Reaves is out, who's gonna do the Reality Check?!"
8216,2020-09-06 23:39:29,inuyf5,Nah. Super relaxed after being stressed for game 7.

8221,2020-09-07 00:10:57,inuyf5,Just throw them in the air and wave them in a non-caring fashion.
8222,2020-09-07 00:20:21,inuyf5,I’ve memorized it now from all these intros
8223,2020-09-07 00:20:46,inuyf5,I was just saying that last game.
8224,2020-09-07 00:21:07,inuyf5,I was about to say that lol!

8233,2020-09-07 00:26:24,inuyf5,That wasnt great
8234,2020-09-07 00:27:55,inuyf5,"Don't have to be a hater to know that was a shot that should've been stopped.

Despite the narrative, no one here hates Fleury. Thinking Lehner is better than him is a completely different thing."
8235,2020-09-07 01:40:25,inuyf5,haha sorry for the discord at your house but that's adorable energy
8236,2020-09-07 01:56:11,inuyf5,"and another thing to add, NONE of the remaining teams are going to be playing like it doesnt matter. They've all been away from family and friends for weeks now. They aren't gonna roll over and die cause they wanna go home."

8244,2020-09-07 00:51:21,inuyf5,The Knights have been playing a lot of hockey days off for the protest. I think this fatigue based. It's not much but the stars got an extra couple of hours of rest.
8245,2020-09-07 01:26:23,inuyf5,Fatigue
8246,2020-09-07 01:27:03,inuyf5,I guess that’s what we learned from playing Vancouver.
8247,2020-09-07 02:10:18,inuyf5,Always feels like a good omen when Panic plays. I just want more
8248,2020-09-07 02:11:33,inuyf5,Anything but Imagine Dragons.

8250,2020-09-07 01:54:36,inuyf5,Maybe everyone is a bit too busy jammin it up themselves.

8254,2020-09-07 00:29:27,inuyf5,I'm feeling that vibe too 😪
8255,2020-09-07 00:39:03,inuyf5,Agreed. I imagine as the game progresses we will start to look like ourselves again and take control.
8256,2020-09-07 00:34:32,inuyf5,🙌
8257,2020-09-07 00:40:00,inuyf5,Making a literal hit list.
8258,2020-09-07 00:49:33,inuyf5,Got some knee on knee.
8259,2020-09-07 00:49:43,inuyf5,Knee on knee
8260,2020-09-07 00:50:35,inuyf5,He’s fine. He was right next to the ref and was hoping they’d call a penalty if he embellished it a bit. He already looks fine and didn’t need medical. So just a cute little embellishment.
8261,2020-09-07 00:51:57,inuyf5,Hes tiny and theyre big.
8262,2020-09-07 00:52:07,inuyf5,Oh shit I blinked and missed it
8263,2020-09-07 00:56:53,inuyf5,*ouch.*
8264,2020-09-07 01:46:25,inuyf5,except its to the chest of defenders in the neutral zone
8265,2020-09-07 01:53:25,inuyf5,Let’s goooo Wild Bill!!  Come out shooting in the 3rd!
8266,2020-09-07 01:49:23,inuyf5,Lmaoooooo
8267,2020-09-07 02:02:17,inuyf5,yes
8268,2020-09-07 02:01:55,inuyf5,Yep
8269,2020-09-07 02:02:07,inuyf5,"Both, actually. Can’t get past neutral zone"
8270,2020-09-07 02:01:34,inuyf5,Trash passings
8271,2020-09-07 02:01:53,inuyf5,Started bad. Then soso and now godmode (hopefully)
8272,2020-09-07 01:15:34,inuyf5,Agreed.  If I'm Pete going into the second I am preaching that Khudo is not Demko. Square up and shoot
8273,2020-09-07 01:15:37,inuyf5,"Zero sympathy or patience for him. 

You want to start? Then play better"
8274,2020-09-07 01:51:19,inuyf5,Only been really into hockey 3 years now. What makes that penalty NOT a shot?
8275,2020-09-07 01:32:32,inuyf5,i added a little sugar to go with it.
8276,2020-09-07 01:31:11,inuyf5,I got gold three days ago. Go gold!
8277,2020-09-07 01:35:06,inuyf5,I hope so yo!!!🤞
8278,2020-09-07 00:01:58,inuyf5,Sick ‘me where the jam goes
8279,2020-09-06 23:59:27,inuyf5,Car dealerships and ambulance chasers are the lifeblood of local sports
8280,2020-09-07 00:19:54,inuyf5,It’s what we need in this series!
8281,2020-09-07 00:36:16,inuyf5,And... he’s back
8282,2020-09-07 00:36:15,inuyf5,Hes back
8283,2020-09-07 00:44:36,inuyf5,little bit yeah
8284,2020-09-07 01:10:11,inuyf5,I refuse to believe Glass is older than 16
8285,2020-09-07 01:34:55,inuyf5,Let's not be Canucks 2.0
8286,2020-09-07 01:29:02,inuyf5,"Chirp back, assert dominance"
8287,2020-09-07 01:29:04,inuyf5,It’s chirping the stars too
8288,2020-09-07 01:30:04,inuyf5,If you light it on fire it will scream.
8289,2020-09-07 01:35:57,inuyf5,I just want Glass to be able to play AT ALL frankly and not have like severe post-concussion syndrome
8290,2020-09-07 01:35:09,inuyf5,*ouch* but you're not wrong
8291,2020-09-07 01:51:44,inuyf5,We’ve had about 40 of those this game
8292,2020-09-07 02:27:06,inuyf5,Dallas are elite at cutting off passing lanes which forces bad passes to be made.
8293,2020-09-07 02:39:47,inuyf5,Fleury still saved 96% of shots this game. The loss definitely wasn’t his fault. But DeBeor definitely prefers Lehner. So we will definitely see him for a while. Our offense lost the game.
8294,2020-09-07 02:38:28,inuyf5,Well hes clearly the main guy. So everytime he tired robin time
8295,2020-09-07 00:13:19,inuyf5,Congrats on your engagement tho!
8296,2020-09-07 01:51:25,inuyf5,Big dick energy is real bruh 😂😂😂

8301,2020-09-07 02:23:47,inuyf5,Orange team good.
8302,2020-09-07 02:27:33,inuyf5,"Much better. But still, feels like you could make a blooper reel with all the shit that’s happened with this team tonight"
8303,2020-09-07 00:13:48,inuyf5,Mute buttons are the greatest invention of our time.
8304,2020-09-07 00:17:53,inuyf5,I’m fairly still new to hockey. What did he do?
8305,2020-09-07 00:49:07,inuyf5,I second that! It *would* be cool rn :-)
8306,2020-09-07 00:50:26,inuyf5,Definitely tired.

8317,2020-09-07 01:18:00,inuyf5,I’m about to make popcorn. I ate popcorn each game we won last series. During the second period.
8318,2020-09-07 01:28:55,inuyf5,That'll work.
8319,2020-09-07 01:53:13,inuyf5,Only positive I can find is we lost game one of the WCF 2 years ago and then shut down the jets next 4 games
8320,2020-09-07 02:01:25,inuyf5,he does post in /r/FortniteCompetitive to be fair
8321,2020-09-07 02:01:00,inuyf5,Wait why?
8322,2020-09-07 02:14:09,inuyf5,Females love that shit
8323,2020-09-07 02:23:34,inuyf5,Yeah. After tripping over himself. Then he got up and skated straight into Schmidt.

8325,2020-09-07 01:34:09,inuyf5,Love to see it
8326,2020-09-07 01:55:53,inuyf5,We should thank something other than stars.
8327,2020-09-07 02:19:00,inuyf5,It’s really starting to look that way.
8328,2020-09-07 02:18:46,inuyf5,Yes
8329,2020-09-07 02:19:08,inuyf5,Let's let the canucks sign him to big long term money first before we declare our offense cold.
8330,2020-09-07 02:39:20,inuyf5,Everyone one of them seemed gassed af from the start
8331,2020-09-07 00:37:08,inuyf5,"That's why when people with no emotional investment in the team look at the goalie situation, they all agree that Lehner is the better goalie. His strength is his positioning."
8332,2020-09-07 00:37:49,inuyf5,Right?! I noticed it in his last start.

8336,2020-09-07 02:26:29,inuyf5,"Good. Need goals to even out or, even better, tilt in our favor."
8337,2020-09-07 02:27:55,inuyf5,but none of them are really quality shorts/chances. it was the same shit against demko. a bunch of bad/mediocre shots.
8338,2020-09-07 02:26:07,inuyf5,A little too late
8339,2020-09-07 00:36:57,inuyf5,Reaver not in there bro
8340,2020-09-07 00:37:11,inuyf5,"""This is playoffs"""
8341,2020-09-07 00:38:17,inuyf5,"Avs fan here, unfortunately, get used to it:/ rooting for you guys beat the stars!"
8342,2020-09-07 00:38:19,inuyf5,Did you watch the Avs v Stars series? This is who the Stars are. If they can get away with it they will try to all day long.
8343,2020-09-07 01:09:12,inuyf5,"I just like hockey and games, ya know?"
8344,2020-09-07 01:50:53,inuyf5,That's the nice way of putting it. Lookin' like straight ass is how I'd describe it.
8345,2020-09-07 01:50:10,inuyf5,That’s an understatement. This team looks like they should’ve been bounced in round 1 the way they’re playing
8346,2020-09-07 02:18:36,inuyf5,This. He wasn’t stacking up blocks. We were feeding him saves.
8347,2020-09-06 23:58:51,inuyf5,"I’m not opposed, Stepho did a great job centering them earlier in the year hopefully he finds that magic tonight"
8348,2020-09-07 00:20:46,inuyf5,Roy looks dapper with that beard
8349,2020-09-07 00:41:41,inuyf5,they don't know what to talk about now that Demko isn't here
8350,2020-09-07 00:42:58,inuyf5,It is now!
8351,2020-09-07 00:45:57,inuyf5,He walked into 🌸

8361,2020-09-07 01:04:17,inuyf5,heresy here: I love the SJS goal song. I loved it before I ever saw a hockey game. Glad they switched to individual songs because I think that song was in a 90s kids movie I liked.
8362,2020-09-07 01:10:00,inuyf5,I love the song Chelsea Dagger and Chicago is not worthy of it
8363,2020-09-07 01:06:13,inuyf5,Vegas boy Joey fuckin' Gallo!
8364,2020-09-07 01:05:47,inuyf5,Luis Robert has won my heart.

8375,2020-09-07 01:41:39,inuyf5,Brought forward?
8376,2020-09-07 01:42:21,inuyf5,Right at the logo.
8377,2020-09-07 01:45:05,inuyf5,no. We made it to the conference final.
8378,2020-09-07 01:47:53,inuyf5,Take off your pants/shorts.
8379,2020-09-07 02:08:16,inuyf5,"Don’t worry, my PP’s up ;)"
8380,2020-09-07 02:09:41,inuyf5,I wish it even went to game 6
8381,2020-09-07 02:17:48,inuyf5,Honestly I’d say Theos stick randomly breaking would be a better example
8382,2020-09-07 02:30:26,inuyf5,We are playing the best defensive team left in the playoffs lol.
8383,2020-09-07 02:38:05,inuyf5,This is what the stars do in the 3rd
8384,2020-09-07 02:52:55,inuyf5,Yea but now we are chasing the lead making it harder to come back
8385,2020-09-07 02:44:47,inuyf5,They purposefully were shutting him down. Theyre keyed onto our best guys.
8386,2020-09-07 01:53:11,inuyf5,You’d think there wasn’t an entire period of hockey left. The Negative Nancy’s tonight are in full force tonight.
8387,2020-09-07 01:54:06,inuyf5,This normally positive sub has turned toxic fast the last few games.
8388,2020-09-07 00:00:29,inuyf5,[Present!](https://i.imgur.com/KGmrPZ9.jpg)
8389,2020-09-07 00:55:11,inuyf5,He’s been playing really well after being the sole starter when Bishop got hurt. Especially when Bishop came back and wasn’t ready for it at all
8390,2020-09-07 01:22:14,inuyf5,You see VGK went on the PP and we can’t have that. Note the DAL penalty was essentially a mandatory call
8391,2020-09-07 01:22:07,inuyf5,"cause fuck you.

~the refs"
8392,2020-09-07 01:57:12,inuyf5,sorry can we hear what that stands for?
8393,2020-09-07 02:05:34,inuyf5,Let the strawberry magic flow through me one last time...
8394,2020-09-07 00:30:48,inuyf5,This is why lehner is in net. I hope flower gets it together this game or he won’t see the ice again this postseason
8395,2020-09-07 01:06:32,inuyf5,Oh what did you get I myself and a del taco kinda person
8396,2020-09-07 01:12:14,inuyf5,it's the little things in life <3 What even is a chalupa supreme?
8397,2020-09-07 01:28:45,inuyf5,0 SOG this period. They would have to be condescending
8398,2020-09-07 01:27:42,inuyf5,[deleted]
8399,2020-09-07 01:33:03,inuyf5,With 0 SOG it’s hard to say anything lol
8400,2020-09-07 01:39:56,inuyf5,Smith is an angel and Klingberg deserves to get hit with the fury of a thousand suns
8401,2020-09-07 01:42:03,inuyf5,This is the way
8402,2020-09-07 01:51:21,inuyf5,Literally the only time shirtcocking is acceptable
8403,2020-09-07 01:51:22,inuyf5,Mmmmm tell me more baby
8404,2020-09-07 01:49:22,inuyf5,"No passing game at all, very frustrating 😕"
8405,2020-09-07 01:50:39,inuyf5,I have never seen the knights play so sloppy.. it’s like the entire team but tuch and whitecloud is hungover
8406,2020-09-07 02:01:29,inuyf5,I concur.
8407,2020-09-07 02:18:18,inuyf5,r/Goldenknights loved u/iCookWaffles because he spoke the truth.
8408,2020-09-07 02:30:56,inuyf5,How the fuck was that not boarding.
8409,2020-09-07 02:31:46,inuyf5,That hit looked particularly painful.
8410,2020-09-07 01:26:53,inuyf5,"At least we don't have to hear ""S#VE D##KO"""
8411,2020-09-06 23:47:19,inuyf5,Yep it’s Cousins playing tonight on the 4th in his place
8412,2020-09-06 23:47:02,inuyf5,He is likely cousins takes his spot this game or swap him and nosek
8413,2020-09-07 00:05:09,inuyf5,Bishop’s been out all playoffs pretty much and was terrible in the one game he played. Khudobin might as well be their starter at this point
8414,2020-09-07 00:07:00,inuyf5,yeah.  Khudobin has been in net.  bishop has been beat up
8415,2020-09-07 00:29:11,inuyf5,"so has your mom

sorry, had to"
8416,2020-09-07 00:32:38,inuyf5,"It reminds me of year 1, game 1 WCF."
8417,2020-09-07 00:53:00,inuyf5,Seeding
8418,2020-09-07 00:53:07,inuyf5,Seeding
8419,2020-09-07 00:53:07,inuyf5,Playoff seeding
8420,2020-09-07 00:53:14,inuyf5,Playoff seed
8421,2020-09-07 00:53:42,inuyf5,Its the team seed.
8422,2020-09-07 00:54:01,inuyf5,the seed
8423,2020-09-07 00:53:39,inuyf5,Theyre the 3rd seed and we are the one seed for the playoffs I believe.
8424,2020-09-07 02:37:34,inuyf5,Vegas committee seppuku too. That’s probably why.
8425,2020-09-07 01:53:00,inuyf5,Because 🦓
8426,2020-09-07 01:58:32,inuyf5,"to be fair, it was super funny when Katherine said during the last game it was a ""Great goalie duel"" when the Canucks had less than 8 SOG during the second intermission."
8427,2020-09-07 01:58:47,inuyf5,"For real. Fluery is basically keeping us in the game and they're talking about

""[Dallas] hasn't had to face many shots, but he's looked great!"""
8428,2020-09-07 02:00:15,inuyf5,"Stormy and McKenna are on Fortress at home on YouTube. 

Edit to say that’s maybe not what you’re looking for, but if you’re lookin for a better intermission experience, that might help."
8429,2020-09-07 02:25:30,inuyf5,Then we win in 5 :)))
8430,2020-09-07 02:26:23,inuyf5,Its like it can take a moment to adjust to a different team 🤔
8431,2020-09-07 00:03:23,inuyf5,Peanut butter and jaaaaaaaaaaaam!
8432,2020-09-07 00:51:02,inuyf5,I dont hate them theyre just clearly a lot better than us.
8433,2020-09-07 01:27:39,inuyf5,"Yeah, trying to make highlight plays every game isn't necessary. Just play finally sound and the highlight reel stuff will naturally come."
8434,2020-09-07 01:28:06,inuyf5,Long change this period. He probably got stuck out there during the 4v4 time.
8435,2020-09-07 01:34:41,inuyf5,KEEP IT THE FUCK UP
8436,2020-09-07 02:00:59,inuyf5,Better passing and be more physical. I can't even count how many times the puck has jumped a stick at the blue line and resulted in us losing offensive position.
8437,2020-09-07 02:01:41,inuyf5,"Be more careful exiting and don’t make “hope” passes.  Wake up and play knights’ hockey, in the O zone.  And shoot at the pads not the chest"
8438,2020-09-07 02:02:01,inuyf5,"They need to take more shots and stop passing across ice and looking for the open guy, in my opinion.

We're being bodied. Those looks aren't there. We need to try to get a redirect or a second chance by getting bodies in front of the goalie and getting the puck at the net because we just get tied up along the wall.

And also, just play better defense. Lol."
8439,2020-09-07 01:58:21,inuyf5,Be a lot more physical than them and shoot like crazy probably
8440,2020-09-07 01:58:57,inuyf5,"Make the Stars net 6"" bigger on all 3 sides."
8441,2020-09-07 01:59:33,inuyf5,The tried and true “Shoot the puck!!!!”
8442,2020-09-07 02:00:17,inuyf5,Honestly if we just stop giving the puck away on missed passes and bad clears it wod go a long way to changing the momentum.
8443,2020-09-07 02:05:04,inuyf5,You username always gets me...
8444,2020-09-07 02:06:05,inuyf5,I second that! Would take the 10 hour drive from NM to drink beers and watch hockey with redditors.
8445,2020-09-07 02:32:49,inuyf5,“Sweep the leg”
8446,2020-09-07 02:36:33,inuyf5,That's what Dallas give you. Avs series was the same.
8447,2020-09-07 02:42:36,inuyf5,Found this [shot attempts](https://gramhum.com/c/CE0Vg0mKpXg)
8448,2020-09-07 02:32:04,inuyf5,He unfortunately probably would have whiffed it
8449,2020-09-07 00:07:43,inuyf5,"Vgk has the ""home"" spot today, so they get the fancy room"
8450,2020-09-07 00:08:15,inuyf5,"I think because Vegas is the ""home"" team for this game, they get the Oilers' locker room at Rogers Place, which is obviously nicer"
8451,2020-09-07 00:08:15,inuyf5,It’s home vs away locker rooms they’re typically like that
8452,2020-09-07 00:09:10,inuyf5,"lol yea, Ive been noticing that since the start of the bubble. One of the perks if winning the #1 seed"
8453,2020-09-07 01:03:17,inuyf5,This is almost as good as u/stastnygetnasty ‘s “your mom” burn
8454,2020-09-07 00:24:21,inuyf5,"Fleury was so far from the net, too. If the pass had connected they would've scored."
8455,2020-09-07 01:34:46,inuyf5,We have less than 10 shots on goal what do you want them to say? Dallas is better right now.
8456,2020-09-07 01:37:17,inuyf5,What happened now?
8457,2020-09-07 01:39:28,inuyf5,I refuse to pay any attention to the NFL until the NHL is over. But thats just me. I'm weird.
8458,2020-09-07 00:30:08,inuyf5,Someone help this man get it out of his back
8459,2020-09-07 00:31:45,inuyf5,We all do
8460,2020-09-07 00:38:08,inuyf5,Yes and yes.
8461,2020-09-07 00:42:23,inuyf5,Nvm
8462,2020-09-07 00:43:19,inuyf5,That was fast
8463,2020-09-07 00:59:59,inuyf5,Hello fellow dodgerbro. You're in the wrong sub though
8464,2020-09-07 01:16:38,inuyf5,I just have strawberries. And jam.
8465,2020-09-07 01:18:42,inuyf5,"I think there's a media guide that they have for every game that lists match-up statistics, player bios and stats, etc. You can sometimes find them on eBay."
8466,2020-09-07 01:19:18,inuyf5,The 8 icings in the first period would support that.
8467,2020-09-07 01:19:35,inuyf5,Everything looks terrible tbh
8468,2020-09-07 01:21:27,inuyf5,My feed must be way behind lol
8469,2020-09-07 01:35:25,inuyf5,Having problems getting it out of our zone too
8470,2020-09-07 01:35:42,inuyf5,That was soft as fuck
8471,2020-09-07 02:04:26,inuyf5,"Nah, Emile Hirsch is doing just fine"
8472,2020-09-07 02:20:33,inuyf5,Cause that's our PP strategy
8473,2020-09-07 00:23:40,inuyf5,"Lehner played 3 games in 4 days, todays a breather day for him"
8474,2020-09-07 00:23:37,inuyf5,Probably just giving Panda some rest honestly
8475,2020-09-07 00:27:20,inuyf5,"I like the hopeful thinking, but Lehner did main 2 series. It seems like PDB is treating flower like a backup"
8476,2020-09-07 00:23:54,inuyf5,I hope so
8477,2020-09-07 00:56:04,inuyf5,Its more that Dallas plays really good in their own zone and cuts off the shooting lanes. They pack the front of the net.
8478,2020-09-07 00:55:24,inuyf5,The latter.
8479,2020-09-07 00:56:00,inuyf5,yes
8480,2020-09-07 00:57:26,inuyf5,We’ve always had finish problems.  The comeback games have been so heartening esp cuz they’ve been multi goal wins.  Hopefully we find our way back to it across these next two series!
8481,2020-09-07 01:05:27,inuyf5,you might as well spit in his face and tell him he has a small dick.
8482,2020-09-07 01:06:05,inuyf5,"Don’t be afraid of the dark side, I’m available if you have any questions"
8483,2020-09-07 01:20:47,inuyf5,Oh yeah same. I was wondering who they’d pick. Since they’d been riding the Vancouver and Colorado train hard before
8484,2020-09-07 02:01:33,inuyf5,I'm gonna get really drunk.
8485,2020-09-07 01:59:40,inuyf5,shitposting with my left hand instead of my right.
8486,2020-09-07 02:02:59,inuyf5,Nothing. I've been channeling optimism all night and I've got faith our boys have got this. Just gonna keep doing my playoff success ritual
8487,2020-09-07 01:58:28,inuyf5,I already took off my pants
8488,2020-09-07 01:58:33,inuyf5,Take off my underwear?
8489,2020-09-07 02:04:06,inuyf5,gotta get someone to water their lawn during off hours
8490,2020-09-07 02:03:06,inuyf5,but not to the head. That's a 5 minute major and game misconduct with a suspension.
8491,2020-09-07 00:45:53,inuyf5,"Vegas: the team everyone hates  

Dallas: the team everyone forgot existed

Eh, I guess let’s talk about Dallas."
8492,2020-09-07 00:19:06,inuyf5,"The other half of our very talented goalie tandem, yes"
8493,2020-09-07 00:19:02,inuyf5,It’s flower power time!
8494,2020-09-07 00:19:45,inuyf5,You want Lehner playing 3 games in 4 nights in the conference final?
8495,2020-09-07 00:31:32,inuyf5,"that's even funnier because I know you meant boogers but bugger is ""faggot"" in British"
8496,2020-09-07 00:31:42,inuyf5,Can confirm heard it from an anonymous source.
8497,2020-09-07 02:33:12,inuyf5,And yet it's not wrong. We've had some serious scoring troubles since Game 4 of last series.
8498,2020-09-07 00:05:04,inuyf5,Cause why not? It's a benefit of having two top notch goalies.
8499,2020-09-07 00:06:43,inuyf5,"Most likely to give Lehner some rest. He had all but one game last series, including the both if the back to back at the end."
8500,2020-09-07 00:05:27,inuyf5,"lehner is probably tired after 3 starts in 4 nights.  start fleury, get robin a couple extra days of rest"
8501,2020-09-07 00:06:14,inuyf5,"I have a feeling it’s to get Lehner rested as b2b in high pressure games is tiring, while also keeping fleury active for if Lehner stops performing"
8502,2020-09-07 00:06:18,inuyf5,Panda played 3 games in 4 days. Letting him rest.
8503,2020-09-07 00:05:31,inuyf5,My guess....least important game of the series and Lehner needs a break.
8504,2020-09-07 00:05:36,inuyf5,Rest lehner one game? Thats the whole point of having two great goalies
8505,2020-09-07 00:04:58,inuyf5,Lehners gotta be tired after his B2B
8506,2020-09-07 00:11:44,inuyf5,"Nah, Dobby’s more of a 1B than a backup. I say the curse doesn’t apply."

8508,2020-09-07 00:32:01,inuyf5,what are arena points? it looks like a video game thing?
8509,2020-09-07 00:55:56,inuyf5,I think Khudobin got his skate to that to kick it sideways just a bit.
8510,2020-09-07 01:17:03,inuyf5,Fuck the Houston Asterisks.
8511,2020-09-07 01:17:12,inuyf5,Oh yeah I fucking do.
8512,2020-09-07 01:35:59,inuyf5,"I like kenny. Looks kind of weird, but solid play by play announcer."
8513,2020-09-07 01:40:59,inuyf5,Right now that should be Carrier. He's always been our Reaves fill-in.
8514,2020-09-07 01:45:12,inuyf5,Can't shoot if you never have the puck in the O zone.
8515,2020-09-07 01:45:57,inuyf5,Its not great to have fewer shots but it was either game 5 or game 6 against the Nucks that we outshot them by like 20 and still lost.
8516,2020-09-07 02:14:15,inuyf5,Dobby from harry potter
8517,2020-09-07 02:14:26,inuyf5,Doby from Harry Potter
8518,2020-09-07 02:14:25,inuyf5,Dobby

8520,2020-09-07 02:15:07,inuyf5,Says Dobby across the bottom of the mask. He's a good elf.
8521,2020-09-07 02:17:04,inuyf5,We need full commitment here!
8522,2020-09-07 02:18:43,inuyf5,I give lessons btw

8524,2020-09-07 01:46:12,inuyf5,Theodore will have to bail us out again...calling it now
8525,2020-09-07 01:46:32,inuyf5,We came back in the third period. I think.
8526,2020-09-07 01:46:44,inuyf5,Third period magic
8527,2020-09-07 01:47:23,inuyf5,This is a result of us being tired more than them being that good.
8528,2020-09-07 01:57:28,inuyf5,"The round robin was a joke, there may have been some strategy involved. Realistically teams had no reason to go hard in the round robin."
8529,2020-09-07 00:59:14,inuyf5,"They also didn’t have a game 6 to game 7 back to back as we have, and I think it’s more that then the 5 hours. 

Regardless, nobody is interested in excuses in the Conference Finals."
8530,2020-09-07 02:34:02,inuyf5,It’s like they’re waiting for the puck to come to them. They can’t *all* be on a NyQuil/DayQuil daze...
8531,2020-09-07 02:33:37,inuyf5,The knights have looked terrible. Stars are looking ok. The one goal was weak af and the game should be 0-0. Vegas is keeping up while playing their worst game of the postseason
8532,2020-09-07 00:48:52,inuyf5,Looked clean

8537,2020-09-07 00:58:51,inuyf5,"Why does every fanbase feel this way? Man, I hear this all the time in football, baseball, whatever. Commentators have been fine, imo: they've been pretty fair and open with how sloppy VGK looks."
8538,2020-09-07 00:58:34,inuyf5,In general they praise the team that is winning.
8539,2020-09-07 00:57:56,inuyf5,I had to switch to the away feed. NBC was just gargling Dallas's balls a bit too much for me to handle
8540,2020-09-07 01:51:43,inuyf5,Dallas is just capitalizing on us being tired. We're making them look amazing by passing it right to their players.
8541,2020-09-07 01:50:11,inuyf5,they cant all be Demko's
8542,2020-09-07 02:07:20,inuyf5,Hague has a lot of holes in his game and throwing him into the fire now isn't smart. Engelland is old and slow and the problem is we are getting outskated.
8543,2020-09-07 02:08:56,inuyf5,When McNabb has a good game he's great. He showed that in game 7
8544,2020-09-07 00:20:18,inuyf5,"Cousins, methinks"
8545,2020-09-07 00:20:28,inuyf5,"Cousins, on the 4th line"

8547,2020-09-07 02:25:28,inuyf5,I panicked thinking my tv was lagging and something happened. I felt very much “what do the signs mean?!???”

8549,2020-09-07 00:48:36,inuyf5,I literally have no idea if you're being sarcastic. Looked a little late to me
8550,2020-09-07 02:00:59,inuyf5,?
8551,2020-09-07 02:41:26,inuyf5,How was this the refs fault?
8552,2020-09-07 02:42:17,inuyf5,Not sure we can blame the refs on this one. We have to look at our offense.
8553,2020-09-07 01:32:45,inuyf5,Who cares. You're not focusing.
8554,2020-09-07 01:32:16,inuyf5,One of my best friends is a small streamer hes really the only person I watch on Twitch and I just give him my prime sub every month lol. I sometimes watch Doc but not often and hes not with Twitch anymore.
8555,2020-09-07 01:35:31,inuyf5,The NWHL
8556,2020-09-07 00:35:32,inuyf5,Keto and stuff. 1-2 carbs per drink means you can fit a couple in your macros and not tank your diet

8558,2020-09-07 02:01:03,inuyf5,We are playing lethargic.
8559,2020-09-07 02:00:20,inuyf5,We’re not playing up to snuff
8560,2020-09-07 02:00:41,inuyf5,"Like we are tired. All things considered, its nothing to worry about yet."
8561,2020-09-07 02:01:14,inuyf5,"They are giving us no time or space.  For our part, we can't make an accurate pass to save our lives and we're skating on sand."
8562,2020-09-07 01:14:26,inuyf5,do you wanna mention Lehner's up for a contract with that or....
8563,2020-09-07 01:08:46,inuyf5,The doctor cut mine off.

8571,2020-09-06 23:37:31,inuyf5,"I can understand that. I’m a bit surprised to be honest, but it’s good that we can get Fleury a game here or there in case we need to rely on him."
8572,2020-09-07 02:33:59,inuyf5,Gossip gurrrrrl
8573,2020-09-07 02:35:00,inuyf5,Yassssss Queen.

8575,2020-09-07 00:41:40,inuyf5,And we can’t panic as a fan base either. It’s barely the first period of the first game in the series
8576,2020-09-07 00:51:21,inuyf5,2020's all fucked up isn't it?
8577,2020-09-07 02:04:33,inuyf5,Hes in the *lifestyle*
8578,2020-09-07 06:07:30,inuyf5,"Am I too on the cutting edge of memes these days? I figured you would have seen some of the ""my wife's boyfriend"" jokes if anyone here has."
8579,2020-09-07 06:05:31,inuyf5,"""my wife's boyfriend"" quips are just a meme.

There is zero percent chance anyone ever dates me again, haha. I'm too old and too poor to even care these days."

8581,2020-09-07 02:06:22,inuyf5,That would be the opposite of what I am describing

8583,2020-09-07 02:07:53,inuyf5,I was thinking Darcy Kuemper. That friggin sasquatch in net is impossible to score on sometimes.
8584,2020-09-07 02:31:48,inuyf5,Ahhh I dunno
8585,2020-09-07 00:48:46,inuyf5,They were. We figured out that we could only win when we played physical back. Get ready for Perry to dive and draw penalties all series. Infuriating.
8586,2020-09-06 23:21:58,inuyf5,"He went 3/4 last round. Had the Flyers over the Islanders. OP suspects his dog just doesn't like the Islanders crochet toy, haha"
8587,2020-09-06 23:20:02,inuyf5,3/4 for the series last round
8588,2020-09-07 01:07:54,inuyf5,"Born and raised here. 26 years. I’m an electrician, running romex and line summer after summer in attics. 117 doesn’t phase me , especially when we earn our chip. However, I will concede the fact that it’s hot as balls."
8589,2020-09-07 16:06:53,inuyf5,We’ve got a lot of major streets in Vegas. Shit it’s all 45/55 mph 3 lane roads from the North to South and East to West. You could social distance the crowd using just Pecos/St Rose.
8590,2020-09-07 00:19:53,inuyf5,minnesota has not been Vegas' best opponent this year.

8595,2020-09-07 01:05:37,inuyf5,We're gonna need more from you next period and the rest of the game.
8596,2020-09-07 01:08:06,inuyf5,"Lol, just trying keep positive vibes going. All happy beeps over here."

8601,2020-09-07 01:18:29,inuyf5,"By far the most pain I've been in in my whole life.

That being said, after 2 days I'm forgetting about how painful it was and debating doing my other knee."
8602,2020-09-07 00:27:10,inuyf5,Tell that to the guy that was throwing an all out bitch fit in here about him a week or so ago. I think we may have chased him off finally lol
8603,2020-09-07 02:01:47,inuyf5,Not to mention that every team left thinks that they have what it takes to win the cup now that they have won at least two series.
8604,2020-09-07 01:57:53,inuyf5,Commitment
8605,2020-09-07 00:49:29,inuyf5,"Agreed. Obviously would be nice to score before the horn, but the way they're playing right now I'm not seeing it. Need to get into the locker room and regroup"

Give me Blue Cheer, Rainbow, Black Sabbath, The Rolling Stones, and the best of em all Aerosmith before we even start talking about that. And that's just bands from that era.

8784,2020-09-06 16:37:00,innaix,If Pitlick and NAK aren't here next season I'm going to be very disappointed
8785,2020-09-06 15:00:49,innaix,"I’d like to see the Flyers let Thompson and Grant go, while re-signing Pitlick. It doesn’t seem like there’s enough room for Pitlick however, we can’t afford to lose his speed and he is always playing his ass off. 

To help make room in the loaded forward room, they should ship out JVR. He did well this series by the end of it, but he doesn’t make sense to keep when Giroux, Farabee and Lindblom are all ahead of him on the left side. Especially with that $7 million price tag.

I also want a replacement for Braun. I understand he’s fine a lot of the time, but he makes horrible mistakes too often for me. I think the money could be better spent on someone else.

After that, I don’t really care what they do. Chuck could do some shifting around and make a big splash if he wants or he can make some depth signings. I think either way, they’ll be pretty fantastic next season."
8786,2020-09-06 15:38:04,innaix,Thank god we don't have to make space for Hart this offseason.
8787,2020-09-06 15:36:30,innaix,"If you aren't going to play Ghost...for the love of god trade him, I'm willing to bet you will get tons of offers.

Out of all those players making over 3m/year only Hayes looked to be worth a damn night in and night out....that's not a good sign at all and tbh I don't know how in the hell you fix that."
8788,2020-09-06 15:29:08,innaix,"The team needs to find a pure scorer, someone that has the confidence and ability to score from anywhere. Maybe it’s a trade, FA or even Frost takes a step next year. 

Idk what the answer is, but not at any time either during the regular season or playoffs did I have the feeling that any single player was that guy. And I haven’t felt that way since probably Briere."
8789,2020-09-06 15:54:11,innaix,They need speed. Big time. They are so slow.
8790,2020-09-06 16:26:52,innaix,Only UFA’s I would bring back are Pitlick and Elliot. Pitlick might get a better contract elsewhere though. One more year with Moose at backup is fine.
8791,2020-09-06 18:04:56,innaix,"Let the NHL UFAs walk, with the exception of Elliott. I like Pitlick but with the flat cap and current forward depth it's hard to see a fit. Only goalies on the market that are appreciably better than Elliott would cost too much money and/or aren't realistic options for a backup role. If you can somehow get Greiss or Khudobin for a similar salary then absolutely, but that doesn't seem likely.

Bridge deals for Myers and NAK, though I'd be happy to go long term with Phil. One-year deal for Patrick. I'd prefer to move on from Hagg (or at least have him in the press box) and roll with Ghost-Friedman as the third pair next year, but I can't see them actually doing that, so throw him a one-year as well.

As far as trades or free agent signings go, especially with the flat cap I'm not sure I see any drastic moves as being realistic. Keep dreaming about being able to trade for some mythical ""speedy sniper"" for pennies on the dollar...those players are in short supply, and expensive in both salary and acquisition cost. And if y'all think JVR is bad defensively, don't even talk to me about Laine who is completely useless when not scoring goals (and like pretty much any scorer, he does have cold streaks).

The other issue with taking a big swing is managing the cap, which isn't going to be increasing anytime soon thanks to COVID. Hart and Sanheim will be up for new deals next summer, and Laughton will be a free agent. The year after they'll need to give Coots a huge raise (hopefully slightly offset by a lower cap hit on Giroux's next contract) and a new deal for Farabee. 

So, while it wouldn't necessarily shock me to see Ghost, JVR, or even Voracek moved, I think Fletch is more likely to do what he did a year ago and make lower-profile/short-term moves. Which isn't what a lot of people who are foaming at the mouth right now wanna hear, but the Holmgren-era front office making panic-driven decisions is a big reason why we spent most of the last decade watching mediocre teams."
8792,2020-09-06 14:54:59,innaix,"I don’t know about the rest, but I certainly think they should trade Montreal back their 7th round pick for Montreal’s 2021 7th."
8793,2020-09-06 17:06:24,innaix,"Let UFAs Thompson, Grant and Braun walk. Resign Pitlick if his asking price is reasonable. Bring Elliott back on a 1 year deal for less if possible. 

Resign RFAs Aube-Kubel, Patrick and Myers. Let Hagg walk.

Move JvR, even if they have to package a lower tier prospect or pick for some team to take him.

If they don't plan on playing Ghost move him. Montreal numerous time has been tied with wanting him, even though his value is low right now at least get some kind of value and clear some cap.

Whoever is in charge of PowerPlay needs to go. 4/53 isn't going to cut it anymore."
8794,2020-09-06 15:47:25,innaix,Shit didn't realize Braun was making almost 4 million....fuck
8795,2020-09-06 23:15:13,innaix,"Therien might need to go after the PP showing in the playoffs. If our PP is even average, it’s a different story."
8796,2020-09-06 18:49:49,innaix,"Only UFA I would really want to keep is Pitlick. Grant I wouod be okay with if he was our 4C but I don't see it happening.

Really interested to see what we end up signing NAK and Myers too. Those guys are 2 really important pieces of our team.

While Moose played fine, I'd like us to shop around for a back up. I'd love to get Khudobin but unless we make some moves (which is possible) we likely won't be able to afford him."
8797,2020-09-06 19:10:45,innaix,SIGN PITLICK
8798,2020-09-07 05:25:14,innaix,Get Therien the fuck out of here.
8799,2020-09-06 16:18:59,innaix,"It’s an annual tradition at this point but Fletch needs to find a true sniper this offseason. It showed in the playoffs that we don’t have anyone who’s a bona fide scoring talent, and that’s kinda been the case since the Carter trade (Simmer/Schenn could score yes but they weren’t true threats from the high slot). 

2nd is probably re-signing Moose. Yes he’s getting older however he’s shown he’s comfortable with the backup role and can still play 20-25 games a season. 

3rd is trading Ghost. Given his prowess as a PPQB there dhould be teams willing to overlook his liabilities in his own zone. If Braun’s walking (all the better imo, we knew he was overpaid when we traded for him and fortunately it didn’t show *that* much this season. It will next year.) then swinging Ghost for a RHD might be a solution. Obviously the effect of this would be Hagg starting every night on the bottom pairing which isn’t ideal and needs to be dealt with in of itself."
8800,2020-09-06 19:24:02,innaix,"Man, Hagg is the god damn whipping boy for you guys. He's not great, but he's serviceable and I think we can all agree Braun brought down the play of all his partners. If anything he's a good trade piece in a trade package. I would hate to let him walk for nothing.

Re-sign: Pitlick, Elliott, Patrick (2 year deal max), NAK, Myers, and Hagg. Maybe Lyon, but I'm inclined to let him walk.

Trade: JVR or Ghost (keep the other for the expansion draft and hope they do better)

For D bring up a rookie. Nisky and Provy can easily mentor the guy.

G - Coots - Voracek

Lindblom - Hayes - TK

Laughton/Raffl - Frost - Farabee/Pitlick

Raffl/JVR - Patrick/Rookie - NAK/Pitlick

Provy/Nisky

Sanheim/Myers

Hagg/Ghost/Rookie

I'd also love if we moved the wings all around frequently. I would love to see Lindblom with Coots and TK and G with Hayes for a full game."
8801,2020-09-06 20:42:00,innaix,"Had a day to mull everything over. Here are some of my initial thoughts, in no particular order:

* Special teams coaching changes are the most necessary alteration needed before the start of next season. Even without major player changes to the power play, the team's effort in the post season was alarming. Philly was 14th in the regular season in PP%, which is fine, but can obviously be better. No need to re-litigate how bad it was in the bubble.

* Let the ""older"" UFAs go (Grant, Thompson, Braun). I could stomach the team re-signing one because their contracts would be low but I'm not rooting for it.

* Re-sign Pitlick. Elliot is a good backup but I won't be bummed if he takes more money elsewhere.

* Attempt to move at least one of the team's veterans, most notable among them being JVR. If Ghost just isn't going to get a shot here, attempt to trade him as well, as much as I like him.

* Work on extending Myers and NAK.

* If the team can move some contracts out, make a play for Pietrangelo or Krug. If Ghost is gone, or not getting regular playing time, than either player is ideal for being on PP1.

* Assuming Zamula and Frost are ready to be senior team regulars, move them up to the full-time roster. Frost's place in the lineup is a bit more fluid with whatever Patrick's future is.

* Focus on wings in the draft."
8802,2020-09-06 15:59:33,innaix,Out of curiosity how does the contract thing work with the expansion draft? I probably should know this already but I’m lazy and don’t pay attention to shit like this. Do contracts just carry over by team? Are they renegotiated? Does the original team have to shoulder some of the contracts in certain situations?
8803,2020-09-06 17:16:41,innaix,I think it's important that Fletcher not overreact to the Islanders series. This is a good team.
8804,2020-09-06 17:45:22,innaix,"There’s no way we upgrade the team through free agency unless we trade players on our team.

We only have 8 million in cap space."
8805,2020-09-06 17:38:08,innaix,"The main FAs I re-sign:

Myers $3.25M/3Y (same deal as Sanheim)

Patrick $2M/2Y (??? No clue how the Patty situation plays out!)

NAK $1M/2Y

Pitlick $1M/2Y

Elliott $2M/1Y

The main FAs I let walk: Thompson, Braun, Grant, Hagg

If I can trade JVR for anything decent, I do. I only trade Ghost for a great return.

As for new players, there's one box to check off for any O or D guy: he has to play smart, fast and intense every second of every shift. And several existing Flyers need to be taught to do that."
8806,2020-09-06 21:55:48,innaix,"I think this team has a bright future and I don't think any big moves are needed. Yes the postseason was disappointing for many of our top guys but that isn't something that can be fixed this offseason. I'm down to give them another chance, since trading anyone big would be selling low, and I don't want to overreact based on a month of hockey in a bubble after 4 months off.

I keep Elliot and Pitlick if the price is right. If not, we get a different cheap veteran backup, and get some more young guys with speed in the bottom 6. Let every other UFA walk. Obviously re-sign Myers, probably to a bridge.

I'll only move JvR or Ghost if we get a great return. As I said we're selling low, we'll also have the opportunity to move one of them to Seattle next year, so I'm alright with giving them one more chance. There aren't really any free agents that catch my eye, if possible I want to add more speed to the bottom 6 forwards.

Overall this might be too optimistic of a take, but I let them run it back for another year, assuming our young guys take another step forward and the vets come out angry with something to prove, we'll be alright. We do have Carter Hart after all"
8807,2020-09-06 15:24:45,innaix,"The only FA's I really have interest in for our team this year are Brodie (although he's more of a luxury that we don't need), Simmonds (mostly sentimental but our PP has sucked since he left), and maybe a few of the depth guys (eg: Clifford, Sheahan, Rieder, Soucy).

I'd prefer not to move JVR if it can be avoided, his production during the season isn't easy to replace. But I do concede that we might be forced to move him since things'll be pretty tight as is."
8808,2020-09-06 15:07:51,innaix,"Without going crazy deep into it, a couple of key points in my opinion (although many may disagree, would like to hear opinions on this):

-Even though I like both of them and think they're good players, you move on from JVR and Ghost at nearly any cost. Sanheim, Provorov, Zamula and York are this teams LD core for many years to come, and this team is simply too cap strapped to be paying JVR a 7 million AAV. You see if you can acrew a couple of picks and prospects for these guys and that is it.

-Probably a controversial opinion, but this is the summer I think you trade Voracek. I personally love Jake and thought he was outright one of our best players these playoffs, but if you're looking to shake up the scoring on this team moving his huge contract and walking away from a player who while great, is also very inconsistent is probably the best way to do this. 


-Get a cheap backup Goaltender. Hart is clearly the guy moving forward and will get a big raise soon. Find a backup for as cheap as possible until one of Sandstrom or Ustimenko can take that job.

As far as additions go, there are a TON of guys who I would love to see in the Orange and Black next season, and quite frankly it's too difficult to get excited to see who some of these guys could be. I think as a starting off point:

Forwards:

Giroux

Coots

TK

Lindblom

Hayes

Farabee

Patrick (please god be ok)

Laughton

Raffl

NAK


Defense:

Provorov

Sanheim

Niskanen

Myers

Hagg

The remaining 3 slots will be filled by either prospects or new pieces acquired in the offseason"
8809,2020-09-06 19:16:26,innaix,"Definitely have to let Thompson and Grant walk. Protect the younger forwards and dangle JVR and Jake in the expansion draft and pray to god Seattle will take one of them to free up some cap space. I wouldn’t mind signing any of vatanen, Edmundson or brodie to play with prov. Bump nisky down to the 3rd pair with hagg, try to trade ghost for a pick to free up cap space or a really solid 3rd line winger who can score 20-25 a year."
8810,2020-09-07 02:00:58,innaix,"Pitlick should be back for the right price, same with NAK. I’d hate to see ghost go because you can tell he has potential, but I just don’t think it’s going to happen here. I hope we trade him as opposed to lose him in the Seattle shuffle. Something would be better than nothing."
8811,2020-09-08 00:32:38,innaix,Leave it to the Flyers to get the first round pick on Patrick and the guy can’t fucking play
8812,2020-09-06 15:17:41,innaix,"Let all the UFAs walk, unless Pitlick takes a pay cut, and he shouldn't.

Let Hagg, Voro and Noel walk, give Myers the Sanheim bridge (or cheaper if you can), bridge NAK with a slight raise, sign Patrick to a 1yr minimum to see if he figures it out.

If Zemula and York both need another year to develop, get a cheap 6D, maybe Brendan Dillon, buying low on a bad year. 

In goal, see if you can get Crawford to play backup on a $3M or less contract, otherwise just get the cheapest warm body that can start 20 games. 

Only move one of the big contracts (Ghost, Hayes, JvR) if you're in on Pietrangelo and need room. He's the only UFA this year I'd swallow market price for. Whoever ponies up for Hoffman and Hall are shooting themselves in the foot.

And for the love of God, fire Therrien and make sure Yeo is aware he's on thin ice."
8813,2020-09-06 15:59:54,innaix,Anybody know how much cap space we have going in before resigning any of our guys
8814,2020-09-06 18:12:55,innaix,"For goaltending, I'd just bring Moose back for cheap. Hart's obviously the guy and then maybe give Ustimenko and Sandstrom some looks.

Defense:

I'd bring back Hagg. We played well with him during the season. Wasn't bad in the playoffs, takes a lot of shots and can hit.  Cheap and the guys seem to like him. Niskanen definitely ain't it, he's gotta be 3rd pairing next season. Hopefully we make a bigger, short term splash for a 1st pairing guy but I don't think Myers is far off. Idk maybe Pietrangelo or Brodie, but we definitely need to solidify our defense, we allowed way to many chances in the slot and unfortunately Carter gives up way too many rebounds so we gotta make up for that. Not saying we are bad defensively, I just think it'll take a little bit to have an elite defense and goalie combo. I'd try to find a way to move ghost. He's just an incredibly expensive 7th defensemen at this point

Forwards:

 Re-sign Pitlick. He clearly fits this system. I'd consider re-signing thompson for the right price. Supposedly a great locker room presence, wins faceoffs, skates hard and eats PK minutes. At times might drop out of the lineup to give some chances for Frost at 2c. I'd like to move on from JVR but we'd have to bring in someone who could score some goals, though I think Lindblom and patrick would be able to fill some of that void. My forward lines would look like

Lindblom - Coots - voracek

Farabee - Hayes -  TK

Giroux - Patrick - NAK

Raffl - Laughton - pitlick"
8815,2020-09-06 17:17:02,innaix,"I’d lile to resign Pitlick at 1.5AAV. Aube-Kubel with 1.25 Mil, and that’s basically the cap from Grant, Thompson and Stewart. 

I’d like to resign both Hagg and Myers from using the 3.8 from Braun’s contract.

I’d like to move JVR but it’s highly unlikely. If we could move him, I’d sign Brassard to a 4x3. 

Being hopeful, I’d move Niskanen and Ghost which frees up 10.25 mil in cap. I’d use that to get Ptierangelo. I could see a 8x5 for Alex and then using that 2mil left for Patrick’s contract. I think line-ups could be 

28-14-11

49-13-93

23-19-25

18-21-12

9-27

6-5

8-47

The best part about the forward group is that there’s so much good talent that can move from bottom 6 to top 6 (Patrick,Oskar,JVR)

The problem comes next year when you have to sign Hart, so maybe no JVR replacement if you can trade him and just give Hart the 7mil because I’m throwing whatever I can at him for him to stay 8 years.

Not to mention you will have a lot of rookies knocking on the doors, (Zamula, York, Frost, and Ratcliffe)"
8816,2020-09-06 16:14:42,innaix,"How do people feel about Drouin? He has been an underachiever but still has some offensive skill. I would consider kicking tires on him and see if we can swap JVR, pick and/or prospect for him.

JVR- 31 years old, 7 mil until until 2022-23

Drouin- 25 years old, 5.5 mil until 2022-23"
8817,2020-09-06 16:50:22,innaix,"Ghost and JVR must go!  I wouldn't focus on D too much simply because we look slow out there vs the Islanders.  And in this salary cap world, there's only so much we can do.  I would focus on trying to make us faster and get somebody who can score goals for crying out loud."
8818,2020-09-07 00:01:35,innaix,"Prioritize bringing back Grant, Pitlick and Elliot. Grant seemed lost in AVms defensive system but hopefully a full season will get him up to speed. Re-sign Elliot even if he ends up cut out of training camp but I doubt it. 

Gotta figure out what the future for JVR and ghost holds, if they’re here they have to be active and if they aren’t active they can’t be here imo.

That TSN trade thing is kinda wild. Why would Hamilton and Ristolinen be available?"
8819,2020-09-07 21:24:10,innaix,"Easier said than done but they need to find the 2020 version of Danny Briere. He was an elite forward that Buffalo couldn't afford at what the Flyers offered. 

Of course, there are no 95 pt forwards that are available. Taylor Hall is close but not affordable. Fletcher needs to really work the trade market and see what is out there in terms of a pure scorer. If you have to part with a D-man, so be it. Winnipeg has to be the obvious target, since they need defense and have both Laine &  Ehlers that could be traded."
8820,2020-09-08 00:24:02,innaix,NAK better be re-signed.
8821,2020-09-08 15:52:30,innaix,"i want goals. give me goals. whoever the best goal scorer available is, let's take 'em"
8822,2020-09-08 15:57:38,innaix,"ship jvr's contract, sign hall for more or less the same cap hit. let's fucking go."
8823,2020-09-06 16:08:57,innaix,"I want ghost. We struggled with scoring this season and never played ghost. I don't understand it. He looked good in the games he played.

Edit: meant post season not regular season. Still hope we give him a chance next year."
8824,2020-09-07 14:48:23,innaix,"We need to get younger and faster. It was clear this series how we lack team speed in a big way. Not all problems can be realistically addressed. I would try to trade JVR to improve speed or at least clear cap space and make room on the roster to have frost up permanently.

I’d also trade Ghost. While fast, he is still an undisciplined turnover machine who hasn’t really gotten it here. Clearing his contract should also be a priority. 

I’d let our older free agents walk, all of them. Extend Myers and NAK. Let Patrick walk by non tendering him (yeah I said it, but what else can they do?, he’s been an incredible bust because he can’t get healthy). 

Finally - with that extra money freed up by these movies I would do what we can to sign Krug.

Then get rid of Therein and fix the power play."
8825,2020-09-06 15:03:14,innaix,"The Voracek, G and JVR contracts are going to hold us back from contending.   We don't have enough offense and have no way of buying more via free agency.  

Watching the drastic difference between two 23 year old in Barzal and TK this playoffs is depressing.     But even if Oskar and TK take another step its not enough overall offense.   And the three vets I named will only keep getting worse from here."
8826,2020-09-07 16:53:40,innaix,"The round robin/#1 seed kind of put people’s expectations out of wack and caused a little overrating of this current team.   Islanders ran circles around us.   As would have Tampa and Vegas and Dallas.   Team speed is a serious issue.  

People don’t want to hear it, but this team could use a shakeup from the veteran core.   No issues with me if Fletcher goes bold and trades a Giroux/Voracek/Coots.   JVR and Ghost should be automatic goners.   

Our Cup window is going to be with the young guns.  It’s time to accept that we’re probably still a year or two away before the next wave of Brink/York are ready.    I’d rather be bold and make moves to maximize our future window."
8827,2020-09-06 17:01:17,innaix,Giroux or Voracek needs to go. Hayes Laughton and Hart were the only flyers awake this series

8830,2020-09-06 16:55:28,innaix,"If he can find a way to make it work, I would love to add Taylor Hall. Doubt it unless one of JVR, Ghost and Vorachek get moved."
8831,2020-09-06 17:54:58,innaix,"If Pitlick and NAK are gone and Thompson and Grant stay, I give up."

8833,2020-09-06 17:35:45,innaix,Amen brotha. Love Pitlick's speed and work ethic. He never takes a shift off.
8834,2020-09-07 17:34:47,innaix,NAK is a RFA so it's pretty guaranteed he's a Flyer next year.
8835,2020-09-06 15:11:35,innaix,"I think if you're looking for a stronger defensive defenseman Vatanen would be a good choice to replace Braun, and if you're looking for a guy actually built to QB a PowerPlay Barrie would be a good option. I agree that Braun will be replaced though"
8836,2020-09-06 16:58:47,innaix,I would prefer they keep Pitlick Thompson and Grant tbh. They are a perfect grind line. Wouldn't hate JVR and/or Raffl getting shipped off. I feel like Raffl is a perfectly average dude and has just been that for years now.
8837,2020-09-06 15:40:54,innaix,"Crazy that he was our 5th highest paid goalie this year. 

We even paid Bryzgalov more than him this year but Bryz doesn’t count against our cap."
8838,2020-09-06 21:06:22,innaix,"This 100%, I love Ghost a ton but would rather him play and succeed on another team than ride the bench on ours"
8839,2020-09-06 19:48:59,innaix,Seriously.. at this point it’s almost not fair to Ghosts career to keep him around. Give him a shot on another team.
8840,2020-09-06 16:01:29,innaix,Draft Gunler or Foerester
8841,2020-09-06 19:23:18,innaix,Top titty Tiffoli is the answer
8842,2020-09-06 18:04:30,innaix,"He doesn’t do much else, but the Flames fanbase seems to be in consensus that Monahan could be on his way out of town."
8843,2020-09-06 16:55:57,innaix,"Ghost, frost, Laughton and two 1sts for Laine"
8844,2020-09-06 19:49:20,innaix,"I think apeed will be decent if NP is good to go and Farabee, Frost stay in the line up. Regardless, I'd like to see JVR go."
8845,2020-09-06 20:47:13,innaix,Pitlick was awesome but I'm not sure if he'll be getting a ton of UFA attention. He might make a little over 1 million but that's still reasonable
8846,2020-09-06 20:57:11,innaix,"I agree with this completely and I'd be happy if they only make small, short term moves. The playoffs were disappointing but I really hope they don't overreact to a very unique and strange postseason"

8850,2020-09-06 17:48:12,innaix,The most understated and yet most important thing mentioned in this whole thread. Better coaching for power play.
8851,2020-09-06 18:17:54,innaix,"I wonder if it's time to pull some of the vets off the first unit also. No matter how bad your PP plan is, when you've got your 5 best offensive players on the ice you expect they will find ways to make things happen and it hasn't been happening. I like JVR but I don't feel like he has replaced that Simmonds/Hartnell like presence in front of the net very well. I really love Provorov but I've yet to see the PP1 succeed much with him having a prominent role... you imagine he HAS to figure that out though because he is going to be the #1 D on this team for a long time. I'm hoping in the next year or two we have Frost playing full time in the NHL and making the powerplay more effective."
8852,2020-09-07 21:40:02,innaix,To be fair you can't blame the coach for the players not being able to make a 5 foot pass consistently.
8853,2020-09-08 00:23:19,innaix,Everything you said here is my exact thoughts lol.
8854,2020-09-06 20:06:03,innaix,"Nolan Patrick is gone. Please stop with this

Edit: I mean they trusted a guy who got a cancer diagnosis 9 months ago and recovered over him. It's pretty clear the Flyers don't like the prospects of him playing any time soon"
8855,2020-09-06 18:58:32,innaix,Totally agree. Feel like I typed this exactly several times this week.
8856,2020-09-06 17:53:38,innaix,Not for long.
8857,2020-09-06 20:45:46,innaix,"We had the room for it this year, so why not. He was a solid veteran guy. It would be a huge mistake to re-sign him though especially for anything close to that"
8858,2020-09-07 06:31:13,innaix,Might? He needs to be gone yesterday.
8859,2020-09-07 18:01:05,innaix,Khudobin is shutting out teams in the conference finals. He won't be cheap.
8860,2020-09-07 12:48:02,innaix,Yes please. It's cool to have 2 former head coaches on our staff but there's a reason they're now assistants. The powerplay was unbelievably bad this postseason and with our talent that shouldn't happen. I see people blaming Giroux but even if Giroux was 78 years old and could barely walk our powerplay should be better than 5 fucking percent
8861,2020-09-06 16:25:57,innaix,"> Fletch needs to find a true sniper this offseason

So how do you respond to the fact that we were [7th in the NHL in goals this season](http://www.nhl.com/stats/teams?reportType=season&seasonFrom=20192020&seasonTo=20192020&gameType=2&filter=gamesPlayed,gte,1&sort=goalsFor&page=0&pageSize=50)? Only 16 behind Tampa for 1st in the NHL."
8862,2020-09-06 18:14:54,innaix,"Considering how well Ghost played this offseason when given the chance, I'd love to see him given more of a role again. Hagg is solid at times, bad at other times and always unexciting and I'm bummed he got the nod over Ghost so much.

If the coaching staff REALLY can't have the confidence to play Gostisbehere and he's just going to be a scratch most of the time, they should trade him while he's still got value. I don't know that I'd be confident in a Hagg/Ghost 3rd pairing either so if Braun is gone, I still think we should find someone similar to replace him (hopefully cheaper). What I'd really love to see is Braun resigned cheaper and then played in the 3rd pairing with Ghost. Let Hagg walk and become a UFA, I don't think he's going to be worth what he can potentially get in arbitration or on the open market."
8863,2020-09-06 16:49:43,innaix,"Hoffman is available, if we can offload JVR then that opens up the money to sign him."

8865,2020-09-07 16:24:49,innaix,">He's not great, but he's serviceable and I think we can all agree Braun brought down the play of all his partners

Hagg ahs significantly improved since past years, but Braun is in no way the weak link of out defense. Throughout the season he was the most consistent shot suppressor and the analytics back that up. He actually raised the defensive ability of whoever he was paired with. Yes, he had a bad bubble. But if you want rail the guy for a bad bubble, there's a lot more names we could mention here. Frankly, on defense, I thought sanheim was the worst. Was good for multiple failed clears every game, some directly leading to goals against. I'm not writing him off for it."
8866,2020-09-06 16:01:57,innaix,"Assuming it's the same rules as the Vegas expansion draft, Seattle will pick 1 player from each team. However, we protect 7 forwards, 3 dmen, and 1 goalie that they can't select from."
8867,2020-09-06 17:27:31,innaix,"Very dependent on the situation at the time but Flyers could strike a deal with Seattle to take a ""bad"" contract or player in exchange for not taking a unprotected younger player the Flyers may value."

8870,2020-09-07 00:02:47,innaix,"This is the most reasonable take in this thread. I really like what we have and feel that with another offseason the young guys can get better and we can take the next step as a team. 

There are attractive options like Brodie, and I irrationally want Simmonds back, but I’d rather squeeze in under the cap with what we have and not move guys like JVR or Ghost."
8871,2020-09-07 16:19:45,innaix,">I keep Elliot and Pitlick if the price is right.

There's no way Elliott says no because of money. If he moves on, it's because he still thinks he can start. I don't think that's likely so Im fairly confident he'll be back.

For pitlick, obviously we don't want to dump money into him, but you'd be hard pressed to find a player more perfect for the role he fills. I'm not gonna turn him away over a couple 100k."
8872,2020-09-06 15:56:17,innaix,"Simmonds would be an absolute waste. They need to get faster too, not slower."
8873,2020-09-06 15:46:00,innaix,"Simmonds is a ghost of himself.  I don't see him coming back here and fitting in well (as much as I'd love to see it, I first started watching when he was in his prime)"
8874,2020-09-06 16:13:30,innaix,Did u not see the islanders targetting JVR's absolutely vacant LW?  He is a massive negative on the ice. I bet he'll be out of the league within 2 years.
8875,2020-09-06 15:35:21,innaix,The only thing I disagree with is Voracek. Hold on to him for one more season. He was probably the forward I noticed most these playoffs. He was one of the few who wasn’t too chicken shit to hold on to the puck for more than a tenth of a second. He’s still a beast and makes the Flyers a much better team. I want to give the young guys more time to mature before moving on.

8878,2020-09-06 15:28:42,innaix,"Agree with almost all of this, only 2 comments I'd make are I think you definitely bring in a Braun replacement no matter what, and that you try to move on from JVR and Ghost regardless of if you're in on Pietrangelo or not"
8879,2020-09-06 16:39:22,innaix,"St. Louis is probably holding onto Pietrangelo, it's one of the reasons they traded Jake Allen to Montreal.  Agree with moving JVR, but it won't be for Pietrangelo."

8884,2020-09-06 19:53:44,innaix,"This isn’t NHL 20. 

Myers is going to get 2.5-3.5 alone and Hagg will get at least 1.5. 

Brassard at 4x3 is crazy, paying 4M for a 30 point scorer is not a great contract 

Niskanen was huge to Provorov’s resurgence, they’re not going to trade him because he played poorly after a 4 month long gap in the season. 

Pietrangelo is getting 9x7, no shot he’s signing anywhere for 5 seasons 

Also ratcliffe isn’t knocking on any doors after his 2019-20 season"

8899,2020-09-06 18:08:50,innaix,Please no. We don't need to mortgage half the team for one player.
8900,2020-09-06 17:02:38,innaix,"Laine fits the role, but they’ll need to shed money too along with giving up quite a lot. I don’t think the assets will be the issue it’s going to be clearing cap space."

8902,2020-09-06 20:03:41,innaix,Np isn't really that fast honestly. And I don't think you can count on him at this point.
8903,2020-09-07 17:43:17,innaix,20 points this season goes as high as $10M. The first 50 guys in that range are $3.4M and up. He's worth more than just his points. Better than Raffl? Raffl is $1.6M. If Pitlick's agent is any good I can see him getting at least Raffl money and likely more between $2-3M
8904,2020-09-06 21:47:56,innaix,"The list of guys we have in the system that could realistically fill in the holes for this team is actually pretty wild. Even if we let every UFA walk, we could have a lineup consisting of 

G-Coots-Voracek
Lindblom-Hayes-TK
Farabee-Patrick-Frost/NAK
Raffl-Laughton-Laczynski/NAK/Allison

And be perfectly fine, with Zamula/Friedman jumping in for HAGG on defense if needed. And we’ll still have Bobby brink + Yam Cork in our back pocket for 2022. 

In my mind, I think we need to go and add some impact somewhere. Do whatever you need to do in order to open up space and grab a player who can change the way defenses have to play you. Like an Ehlers with speed or Laine with his shot. We have a lot of ammunition to use for a trade should that be what spicy Chuck wants to do. it felt like all playoffs the Canadians and Islanders played pretty much every line the exact same way. That could just be me, but it feels like they need someone who is just different than what they have, someone with a standout trait about their game."
8905,2020-09-07 16:48:55,innaix,"The fanbase is in denial about Patrick.  

95% of the posters here are just penciling him in the lineup as if he hasn’t had migraine symptoms for like a year and a half now."

8907,2020-09-07 16:15:50,innaix,I would really like to see hakstol as the PP coach
8908,2020-09-07 16:14:59,innaix,"This same core has been running the PP for like 5 years. Even at it's worst, the percentage was mostly brought down by a horrific 2nd unit. There's too much talent there for it to look like that. Its not an execution thing"
8909,2020-09-06 16:36:53,innaix,"We have a bunch of capable scorers (G, Coots, Hayes, TK) but no true standout guy like a Laine or Tarasenko who can just whip home 30+ a season. TK’s probably the closest to that and he’s still more of a playmaker. The bright spot is a lot of defensive scoring. IIRC the defensemen collectively finished top-3 in goals when the season was suspended. Myers impressed a lot, he’s already one of the best shots on the team. 

It’s not so much that I think the team lacks goal-scoring as it is a sniper would be the “missing piece” to make them a true contender"
8910,2020-09-06 17:29:40,innaix,Where was that production in the playoffs
8911,2020-09-06 20:55:40,innaix,"I don't think signing Hoffman is a good idea, paying a 30 year old forward in free agency rarely works out, and moving JvR to do it seems like we're just switching out guys who will have the same problem"
8912,2020-09-06 19:58:32,innaix,That would be a horrendous trade for chicago
8913,2020-09-07 16:54:36,innaix,"That's what annoys me a lot with Hagg-haters is like they can't forgive the guy for not being amazing his first few years. Let's not forget Raffl was not always the dependable guy he is now.

I didn't know that about Braun, being on the west coast it was hard to catch all regular season games. I remember Braun being ok at times, but very bad in others. Though isn't that just Flyers overall at this point?

I honestly think our D is best when we jumble the lines during games. It puts other teams off their game and I think that our guys know their teammates well enough that they can cover each other's weaknesses well."
8914,2020-09-06 16:24:16,innaix,But say they took JVR from us. Would we still have to shoulder some of his contract or would Seattle have to pick the entire contract up? Or would they have to renegotiate?
8915,2020-09-06 19:52:20,innaix,"It's really only Giroux and Voracek I'm worried about. Coutrier, Hayes, TK, Lindblom, Farabee, Patrick, Provorov, Laughton, etc. aren't that old. Hart is obviously a child. I'll add Frost and Sandin as guys with potential who are young. JVR, Niskanen, and Braun aren't needed.

I agree they need a bit more speed, but I don't think that needs a lot of major moves."
8916,2020-09-07 01:37:28,innaix,The Islanders are an older team than us. This take of us being old and slow is just not true.
8917,2020-09-06 18:20:04,innaix,I can't imagine that Patrick has any leverage for a contract like that. I'd be surprised if he gets more than $1M for 1Y. Pitlick is likely to get more.
8918,2020-09-06 21:55:10,innaix,Plenty of cap space after I trade JVR and Ghost.
8919,2020-09-06 18:47:40,innaix,"This is probably true.

Maybe it’s influenced fully by sentiment, but I wouldn’t mind bringing him back on a sub 2M deal as a 4th line guy and PP specialist. But we’d have to make a move to do it and I’d personally rather hold onto both Ghost and JVR."
8920,2020-09-06 18:03:46,innaix,"One of the worst puck-watchers ever. Stands there swirling slowly on a pivot chewing his damn mouthguard, and rarely attacks the puck."
8921,2020-09-06 15:40:46,innaix,"This is all fair, and I agree he was our best forward these playoffs. My big, big worry with him is that if we accidentally hold onto him for too long the remainder of his contract could turn into a full blown nightmare"
8922,2020-09-06 15:46:53,innaix,"I kind of agree. It's hard to pinpoint exactly which players need to be moved this season. Definitely not as obvious as previous seasons. The one thing we do need to acknowledge is that we have to sign a ton of kids next 2 seasons. One of these big contracts will have to go at some point whether is be JVR Voracek or others. 

But on the contrary, Voracek's current value could be the highest it will be for the rest of his career. His contract is terrible for us."
8923,2020-09-06 19:10:47,innaix,Hayes also has a NMC so it's not happening
8924,2020-09-06 16:00:39,innaix,"I'm a lot lower on Hayes and higher on JvR than most of the sub, I'm sure everyone else would rather move one of the other two guys which is fine. I don't think it happens anyway. 

But a Provorov- Pietrangelo pair, even if you only get it for like 2 years before he drops off, would be incredible"
8925,2020-09-06 15:41:26,innaix,"I just don't see the reason to move them for next season unless it's for a specific acquisition, when you can just take one more run with the team that just had a great season and then let one go to Seattle.

I know JvR makes a lot of money, but Farabee is not better than him yet, and having the LW depth we do allows you to move Giroux to center when you need to if someone else gets banged up."
8926,2020-09-06 16:40:12,innaix,Then don't move him
8927,2020-09-06 20:00:51,innaix,It’s only 2 more seasons
8928,2020-09-06 17:16:50,innaix,9.6 it is
8929,2020-09-06 19:57:10,innaix,I like Farabee but I don’t think he’s going to be a better version of couturier
8930,2020-09-06 18:38:31,innaix,"Hah wow forgot about farabee. Not sure what line he'll end up on, but probably don't have to re-sign Pitlick then."
8931,2020-09-07 22:43:30,innaix,"Lol, you don't have to be a dick about it. I'm highly aware my scenario is in dream land, but it's nice to dream. And I think 3 is the max Myers could get. I'm not saying to trade Niskanen because he had a poor performance, but you're telling me you wouldn't trade him for a chance to sign Ptierangelo? He wants 9x7? Ok, by moving Ghost and Niskanen you can still afford that."
8932,2020-09-06 15:13:19,innaix,"Regular season.   Its a different animal.   Frankly im tired of this excuse year after year when we are done watching the same thing unfold.     If people dont see what this vet core is by now I dont know what to tell you.  It isnt good enough.  And we are stuck with it.   But I have no doubt there are still people that will say G and Voracek are great and keys to success.   How many years do you guys have to see the same thing before you realize you wont get different results with this vet core?   They aren't winners.  Flat out. 

TK is one of our only young bright spots on offense and he was absolutely invisible all playoffs while Barzal was a factor constantly.    It gets tiring when it seems like every damn team we play in the playoffs has some young offensive dynamo while we struggle to  find guys that can even gain the zone without a dump in."
8933,2020-09-07 02:28:30,innaix,"Nah you're right lets keep them and make it to next years playoffs with the worst powerplay of the league. Both of them have been on a downward slope, constantly looking for a pass instead of shot, constantly turning the puck over with no look passes. Keep one get rid of the other for someone that compliments the first line better. Id hate to see either of them go, but its getting mildly frustrating watching them play."
8934,2020-09-06 15:55:13,innaix,Yep. Someone is going to overpay for him. Hopefully it's not the flyers
8935,2020-09-06 15:38:39,innaix,"Barrie still scored above .5 PPG this past season, and I dont think he will command much more than 4x5million. I agree he is a bit of a risky option, but if you move on from Ghost this summer it may be nice to have a guy that actually knows how to play PPQB"
8936,2020-09-06 15:20:56,innaix,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't Brodie a LD? AV seems to only like D playing on their strong side"
8937,2020-09-06 16:38:21,innaix,I think they’re going to do everything they can to move ghost
8938,2020-09-07 05:22:07,innaix,"Ghost Niskanen will not work, they would get beat down low in the defensive zone. I wouldn't be surprised if they tried to move ghost."
8939,2020-09-06 20:19:47,innaix,They play different roles completely but sure.
8940,2020-09-06 17:15:40,innaix,"Laughton will be on the wing if/when Patrick returns. The coach clearly prefers him as a winger. 

And who thinks Frost is the next Briere? That’s an insanely ambitious comparison. Frost is worth keeping and developing into a middle-six forward for sure, but the stars will *really* need to align for him to end up in the same conversation as Briere."
8941,2020-09-06 18:12:49,innaix,Who says Frost is the next Briere? Because they gave him his old number? Lol
8942,2020-09-06 18:11:29,innaix,"Aren't ghost, Braun & Niskanen like $15 million combined? All three are pretty tradeable or ufa's."
8943,2020-09-06 22:26:42,innaix,"Not really counting him in, but staying hopeful. Both because I'd love to see him play, and it would be terrible for his career to be over already."
8944,2020-09-07 17:59:35,innaix,Thank you. People act like sports teams aren't businesses.
8945,2020-09-06 16:51:29,innaix,"I do think TK will be that guy. I think you could say our scoring isn't consistent. What's your definition of a ""sniper""?

And what evidence do you have that makes you think our problems will be solved with a let's say 40 goal scorer. And to what cost do you pay for one?"
8946,2020-09-06 17:11:14,innaix,"I think if we had a real sniper that was truly a scoring threat every time they were on the ice, it would also open up the ice gutter the other players to produce more as well."
8947,2020-09-06 18:39:41,innaix,Wish I could tell you
8948,2020-09-06 16:38:09,innaix,They take the entire contract unless we work out a deal beforehand.
8949,2020-09-06 17:19:16,innaix,"They take the full contract. Contracts never get renegotiated, and they can only split salary if it’s one of the conditions in a trade. So whoever Seattle takes, they take the whole salary. 

Keep in mind, they need to reach the cap floor, so they will need to take some high cap hit contracts."
8950,2020-09-06 16:43:16,innaix,"They take the contract, but could also say give us a picks in exchange for keeping some or all of his contact"
8951,2020-09-06 16:34:45,innaix,Pretty sure they take the contract.
8952,2020-09-06 18:31:57,innaix,"Its pathetic. Im convinced his teammates resent him for it. The expression of only being as strong as your weakest link is true when i comes to 5v5 defense, and the players know it. The isles consistently worked the puck to his LW and were able to generate A+ quality chances stemming from the breakdows caused by JVR's absent mindedness. 

The fucked up part is that he's shown in stretches that he can play passable defense, but then he comes out in GAME 7 playing defense like he's in a pickup hockey game at the local rink. 

Im convinced his days in the bigs are numbered at this point. 3 more years left on his deal, I'd bet hes out of the league before it ends."
8953,2020-09-06 20:51:36,innaix,"That's a fair worry but Voracek will be 34 when his contract is up, which isn't super old. he's not a player who relies on speed, he plays a lot like Jagr, using his body to guard the puck. I think he'll be fine. But 8 million is a lot"
8954,2020-09-06 15:51:17,innaix,"That’s how I felt before this season too though, along with many others. We were all well off. He managed a 67 point pace and his 56 points were good enough for 3rd on the team.

I don’t think he’ll have a sudden drastic regression because he has showed no signs of slowing down yet.

Edit: Plus you have to consider, he plays RW, the Flyers weakest point of offense. If you move on from Jake, Konecny can step up to the top line but who can play the 2nd line effectively?"
8955,2020-09-06 18:57:05,innaix,"I don’t think I would push too hard to trade Voracek, but I would put it out there that he is available.  If a team offers a good deal they should take it."
8956,2020-09-06 16:08:25,innaix,"Um, imagine what these playoffs look like without hayes... Plus he is a center which is way harder to replace.

AP is not going to get a contract that fans would be fine with when he drops off hard in a couple years."
8957,2020-09-06 16:46:49,innaix,"Well, what about someone like Mike Hoffman or Evengii Dadonov?  About the same hit per year and more production.  Granted Hoffman is 30, but he picked up Florida."
8958,2020-09-06 20:09:46,innaix,"Theyre totally different players obviously so tough to compare. Farabee will never be a 215lb 6'3"" center, but it doesnt mean he cant have similar upside all things considered. I think Farabee is a future star."
8959,2020-09-06 18:47:37,innaix,"Could see Frost too, especially if we don't get Patrick"
8960,2020-09-06 15:21:29,innaix,"If you’ve got a plan to replace Giroux’s .77 points per game and Jake’s .81 points per game next season, I’m all ears. But you haven’t suggested anything, so my assumption is that your plan involves getting rid of that production and magically assuming that the team won’t be significantly worse on offense next season, resulting in a huge step backward. 

Right now, it sounds like your plan is to build a time machine and go back to 2015 and draft Matt Barzal with a pick that the Flyers didn’t own.

And one other thing, Alex Ovechkin “wasn’t a winner” either. Until he was."
8961,2020-09-06 15:20:33,innaix,"Here’s what I don’t get about this take. Yes the Flyers need a young speedy guy, but what does that have to G and Jake. You say they’re not winners as if they haven’t spent their entire time here up until this year with sub par defense, goaltending and coaching. They have literally done their job every year, it’s other players letting us down. This year our entire offense was nullified in the playoffs. You can’t get much going If nobody is doing anything.

All you’ll find after getting rid of them is that the team got worse, not better."
8962,2020-09-06 19:56:23,innaix,">  Frankly im tired of this excuse year after year when we are done watching the same thing unfold.

What is it we're seeing unfold year after year? Disappointments in the postseason?"
8963,2020-09-06 19:41:19,innaix,CGY fans say Brodie plays much better on his off side
8964,2020-09-06 15:22:18,innaix,"He’s a left handed RD.

But yeah, AV does seem to like having defenseman play their strong side."
8965,2020-09-06 18:21:11,innaix,"No, his scoring ability in juniors is absolutely astounding and his vision is top notch. Obviously he needs playing time to get acclimated but I'm very high on him being a Briere type of player."
8966,2020-09-06 17:10:43,innaix,"It’s not really about how many goals they score, it’s just having someone that at any time can burry it consistently. They don’t have that and I’m talking about someone like Briere for example.

TK isn’t that guy yet, especially if you consider someone like Laine who is that type of player. I’m not saying sell the farm for him but that’s the type of player most of the fan base is referring to when they say that."
8967,2020-09-06 17:17:10,innaix,"I wouldn’t be surprised if TK eventually becomes a 35+ goal-scorer a season, he’s shown a lot of creativity in the offensive zone and is a speed demon whenever he carries the puck up the wing. That said he just doesn’t have the shot to be truly elite. We need a guy who can sit in the high slot and beat the goalie straight-up or off a one-timer.


A goal-scorer would be a massive boost in the offensive zone. We have talented playmakers like Gand Cek that have both thrived in the past with worse linemates. G could hit 60 assists again if he had an elite scorer to feed, not to mention our PP production would drastically improve.

Now cost is an issue. The need to re-sign Pitlick, Moose, NAK, Patrick, and Myers will probably be at least $7M altogether and pretty much means going out and signing Hall is off the table. So a trade is the only real option. I wouldn’t be opposed to trading draft picks for one though could understand the Flyers’ record with trading draft picks for players in recent history has gone.... poorly to say the least"
8968,2020-09-06 17:22:13,innaix,Good. Because we’ve got at least one weighty and useless contract that we could stand to shed.
8969,2020-09-06 17:16:05,innaix,I kinda figured.
8970,2020-09-07 01:31:54,innaix,Do we know when this Seattle draft is happening yet?
8971,2020-09-06 22:01:00,innaix,"Coaching has to be part of it. Make him watch videotape of himself loafing during games for an hour before practice, then make him do skating drills attacking players with the puck all practice. I dunno. Do something. He obviously has the size; he just does not have the will. That can be coached with identification, repetition, reward, and punishment."
8972,2020-09-06 16:44:44,innaix,I have no idea if Patrick is good at faceoffs but I could see him be a dominant RW power forward... unless he’s super solid in the back end too
8973,2020-09-06 20:00:23,innaix,"> AP is not going to get a contract that fans would be fine with when he drops off hard in a couple years.

Same thing will happen with Hayes"
8974,2020-09-06 16:11:52,innaix,"These playoffs would have looked like a bad team getting eliminated in the first round instead of the second, who cares?"
8975,2020-09-06 17:12:28,innaix,"I'd have to look more into Dadonov, but I'm not touching Hoffman. Someone is gonna throw him like 6-8 mil for his 30 goals, but it's all empty production. He needs ice time with top centers and shooting volume to get those goals, and the trade-off is bad defense.

Here, he's either making the top line worse, or he's stuck on the 3rd line and won't get his goals.

If we're going to overpay a 3rd line winger, [it's JvR and it's not even close](https://i.imgur.com/F7WZxYn.png)."
8976,2020-09-06 15:26:11,innaix,"I think his point is that Giroux has never put the entire team on his back and dragged them kicking and screaming to a Stanley Cup. If he were a true leader, he would do that. Ignore the fact that no Cup winner in recent memory has been a one man show and rather, all of them have ridiculously good depth. Giroux should have defied all the conventions of building a winner and just won something. 

Did I get that right, OP?"
8977,2020-09-06 15:24:01,innaix,"G has something like 2 goals in the last 30 playoff games.   How can you watch these playoffs and think G did his job?  What are you guys seeing?   Voracek gave all the effort he could.  Hes just washed.  

Not only are they both consistent losers but the team clearly doesn't respond to the vet leadership at all.   Its impossible to come out with less passion to win than last night in a game 7.   And this is the same story with multiple coaches.   It isnt just a coaching issue."
8978,2020-09-06 18:54:38,innaix,Take it from someone who saw Frost play in the juniors a lot in person: if you're expecting him to be a sniper you're gonna be real disappointed. He's way closer to a Giroux type playmaker than Laine.
8979,2020-09-06 17:26:27,innaix,Briere was awesome against the Hawks in the 2010 SCF.
8980,2020-09-06 17:19:18,innaix,"Exactly. A guy like Laine or Kaner for example who has a laser. If we had someone of that caliber it’d do so much for G/Cek’s production. 

That’s the big problem with the Flyers since Hextall became GM. There’s been no Briere or Gagne or Hartnell type that was a threat from the high slot"
8981,2020-09-06 22:16:14,innaix,"TK's playoff performace was concerning. Hes a guy that is very opportunistic and will make a team pay for a mistake that leads to some open ice or an odd man, but with no open ice he was very padestrian out there."
8982,2020-09-07 02:02:02,innaix,after next season
8983,2020-09-07 06:30:47,innaix,"I agree to some extent, but he's been in the league for well over a decade now. If he hasn't done that on his own by now, I don't know what makes anybody think he ever will. He's always been a lazy passenger."
8984,2020-09-06 20:10:52,innaix,We don’t even know if Patrick will ever play again
8985,2020-09-06 20:02:48,innaix,Of course. But at least hayes is 3 years younger than AP.
8986,2020-09-06 16:15:54,innaix,I'm sure the young players on the team would have cared. I'm sure they learned some great lessons on what it takes to win in the playoffs from this second series.
8987,2020-09-06 15:38:24,innaix,"A team kinda needs one of its highest paid players and captain to contribute to a playoff run.   Its not that difficult.   You guys sound like Ben Simmons fans. 

Same excuses year after year after year with this fan base.   I dont understand it.  

Also you mentioned a time machine below.   Well its more about scouting and the lack of it when it comes to the last many many years of Flyers hockey.   

For example we took a limited athlete bust Nolan Patrick at #2 instead of two allstars in Pettersson and Heiskanen.    It was clear back then that Patrick was who you pick if it was still 1970.  Typical Flyers pick.  Pettersson was the offensive dynamo we needed and instead they thought they were playing it safe with a slug-like skating Patrick."
8988,2020-09-06 15:42:01,innaix,"I agree last night was unacceptable but watching the game, the first and second lines were the only two able to get into the offensive end. They were the Flyers offense last night. Jake Voracek and Kevin Hayes were the only two players who could consistently carry the puck into the offensive end. Everyone else was dumping and chasing, which doesn’t work against a team that’s so good along the boards. Which that aspect comes down to coaching. Even if it were the players choice to dump and chase, why didn’t the coaching staff tell them to stop when they saw it repeatedly fail?

Also, no one on the team could make a pass to save their life. Laughton, Konecny, Thompson and Niskanen were just giving the other team the puck. You can’t do much if your on defense the entire game.

I agree G needs to be better moving forward, but you’re attributing way more of this series loss to them than they deserve."
8989,2020-09-06 16:53:28,innaix,Oh I forgot that Claude Giroux is known for his goal scoring prowess and we should focus only on that and not his overall production.
8990,2020-09-07 03:58:38,innaix,Oh damn for some reason I was under the impression they were gonna be in the league this coming year
8991,2020-09-07 07:23:20,innaix,He needs Pat Croce.
8992,2020-09-06 20:03:16,innaix,Pietrangelo is 30 and Hayes 28
8993,2020-09-06 16:01:14,innaix,">For example we took a limited athlete bust Nolan Patrick at #2 instead of two allstars in Pettersson and Heiskanen.    It was clear back then that Patrick was who you pick if it was still 1970.  Typical Flyers pick.  Pettersson was the offensive dynamo we needed and instead they thought they were playing it safe with a slug-like skating Patrick.

I’m sorry? You do not remember the 2017 draft very well. Before that draft, the narrative was that it was a weak draft and Nolan Patrick and Nico Hischier were the only two worth talking about. Had the Flyers picked Heiskanen or Petterson, they would have been roasted to no end. Patrick was the obvious pick at the time."
8994,2020-09-06 17:23:26,innaix,"um....he had 8 points in 16 playoff games this year with a plus minus of 1.

And I just saw a guy below call Coots a top 5-10 player in the NHL.   Jesus this fan base is as clueless as they come."
8995,2020-09-06 20:04:49,innaix,Lol. Ok. So he's basically 2.5 years younger. The point still stands beyond being pedantic.
8996,2020-09-06 16:27:55,innaix,"I remember it very well.  The mock drafters had Nolan and Hischier at the top mostly.   But There was no question of Petterssons talent.  Theres were question about how hed handle the NHL physicality.   Turns out its no problem.  And oddly enough Patrick cant handle it when that was supposed to be his game.   

Patricks peak is Coots.  And thats an ok player.  But not a guy who is winning you anything in the modern NHL."
8997,2020-09-06 17:25:53,innaix,".5 PPG when the entire team sucked at scoring. Yeah, it’s probably G’s fault."
8998,2020-09-06 20:05:47,innaix,"Closer to 2.33 years younger

But yeah he’d decline towards the end pretty badly"
8999,2020-09-06 16:51:59,innaix,"This is not only revisionist but delusional. You’re rewriting the history of the draft narratives to fit your point. It’s delusional to refer to Couturier as an “ok player.”

Get a sip of water and take a lap, bud."
9000,2020-09-06 17:57:06,innaix,Yeah I'd hate to have a player with a peak of Coots. Who needs a Selke finalist caliber player anyway.
9001,2020-09-06 16:47:59,innaix,So Patrick’s peak is being a top 5-10 player in the NHL? Damn what a bust. Terrible scouting.
9002,2020-09-06 20:06:31,innaix,Jesus dude... stop....
9003,2020-09-06 18:29:52,innaix,Man o man you people are nuts.  Coots is a role player.
9004,2020-09-06 17:26:43,innaix,Couturier is absolutely not a top 10 player in the NHL let alone top 5.
9005,2020-09-06 19:20:25,innaix,Role players don’t have back to back 70pt seasons and get Selke nominations
9006,2020-09-06 17:31:23,innaix,"Maybe not at this moment (although I think you could argue he is), but he’s close. And we are talking about “peaks” - he’s only going to keep getting better."
9007,2020-09-06 17:38:10,innaix,"Unfortunately what he is now is most likely what he’ll be for the foreseeable future. Studies have shown that players tend to peak at 25 and Coots is 27. 

I’d say he’s a top 15-20 *forward* but that’s as far as I’d go."
9008,2020-09-06 18:02:09,innaix,"Yeah 5 to 10 is absurd especially because they said player. I don’t think he’s even a top 10 forward.

McDavid, MacKinnon, Draisaitl, Kucherov, Crosby, Panarin, Kane, Marchand, Mark Stone and Ovechkin are all easy ones to name ahead of Coots."

9268,2020-09-04 16:38:24,imhear,"*Can* they? Possibly.

*Will* they? Most likely not. Fox is not a studio owned by Seth MacFarlane or entirely dedicated to Seth MacFarlane projects, so the idea of closing off the Fox lot and one of the hotels next to Fox specifically for the cast/crew of one show is quite a big ""ask"" to accomplish a full ""bubble.""

Other big producers that work on the Fox lot quite a bit would likely end up wanting the same thing... so I think the ""politics"" of the industry in LA would prevent something like this from happening. The only thing I can see as an ""advantage"" for Orville is the fact that they don't do much location shooting, so it would make more sense in terms of logistics.

Also, I don't know if COVID is considered more ""under control"" in ATL, but I see that things like movie theaters are open there while there's still no clear idea as to when those things might re-open in LA."
9269,2020-09-04 17:28:11,imhear,"The largest issue is that Los Angeles doesn't have this sort of ability to create a bubble like this.

Like /u/larrythefatcat mentioned, The Orville is shot on a lot. It'd probably be easier to move the whole production to Canada or another country and shoot in a bubble there, rather than have to deal with the entirety of creating a bubble in LA.

And to be honest, optics wise having a bubble for sports looks out of touch as hell. People are getting multiple covid tests when the average person cannot obtain one."

9271,2020-09-04 18:25:46,imhear,The Orville doesn't have enough support or money behind it. To add a full quarantine procedure for a full cast and crew of the show would probably triple it's already reduced budget as is.
9272,2020-09-04 20:40:05,imhear,"That's a big financial ask from the studio and a big personal ask for the cast and crew. You're talking about taking all the actors, directors, crew, etc etc. Keeping them in one place, but not too close a place because they need to isolate when they arrive. Then they would need to remain isolated, living and eating and everything together. But not seeing their families, going to outside functions or events, etc. 

Done perfectly, yea it's the safest way. But if people slip or falter, and everybody is human, then it's all wrecked. And now you have the illness in an enclosed area where people are feeling safe, that's a recipe for disaster."

This is the game that will define Jamie Benn's legacy. This might be his last and best chance at a cup. I want to see the pissed off, physical, goal scoring captain step up and deliver this series to us. I want to see the Stars that started game 4, laying hit after hit, getting the Avs off their game plan, and getting in their heads. I want to see more than one goal against an AHL goalie.

10192,2020-09-04 17:53:37,imf97c,Need Benn and Seguin to show out today.  Money needs to describe more than just their contracts.
10193,2020-09-04 20:53:34,imf97c,Seguin or Roope this period. I got the feels for it.
10194,2020-09-04 21:47:03,imf97c,It’s one goal.

10200,2020-09-04 13:33:59,imf97c,"I was thinking about this the other day, but Dallas teams have been bad on the big stage vs teams from Denver since the 2000 WCF.

The stars lost twice vs Colorado in the playoffs.

The Mavs lost to the nuggets in the playoffs (also the only time Carmelo Anthony got out of the first round).

The cowboys haven’t beaten the broncos since 1995. 

FCD (a team that had beaten Beckham, Donovan and company the week prior) lost to Colorado in the mls finals.

Only saving grace is that the rangers are in a separate league from the Rockies so we never play them. But the rangers suck now anyways so we’d probably lose too.

We gotta be due for one as a city, right?"

10232,2020-09-04 20:23:39,imf97c,Pierre is actually right in saying that Hutchinson’s rebound control is not good
10233,2020-09-04 20:24:09,imf97c,just keep firing away we'll get those rebounds eventually
10234,2020-09-04 20:25:47,imf97c,We’re letting them enter the zone at will

10252,2020-09-04 20:39:44,imf97c,god if we can't beat the avs while they're missing almost 10 players
10253,2020-09-04 20:40:51,imf97c,We are letting the Avs walk right into our zone untouched.

10255,2020-09-04 20:45:05,imf97c,I like how piere talks about the stars only to bring up the past .. like ok.
10256,2020-09-04 20:45:57,imf97c,Need Dobby to get back his confidence. Good to see him catch the past couple of shots easily

10259,2020-09-04 20:53:22,imf97c,I liked Kivvy's hustle. He's really small compared to Hintz but he has good speed.
10260,2020-09-04 21:00:13,imf97c,Why does this team give up leads so quickly? It sucks so much energy away to take a lead and give it up 20 seconds later.
10261,2020-09-04 21:10:31,imf97c,"Uh, I actually like Benn playing with Cogs and Starfaks."

10273,2020-09-04 21:19:39,imf97c,Why would we dump right there when there’s not a shift change and 1 defender on the blue line wtf
10274,2020-09-04 21:22:29,imf97c,Another penalty. The favoritism towards the Avs is unreal.
10275,2020-09-04 21:22:42,imf97c,Haha. Grabs Perrys leg and Perry gets called.
10276,2020-09-04 21:22:43,imf97c,Bullshit call
10277,2020-09-04 21:23:32,imf97c,this feels like a game deciding power play. what a bullshit call.
10278,2020-09-04 21:24:21,imf97c,I might be done. This is too depressing. I’d like to see some life from this team.

As if scheduling the game for 3pm isn’t already bad for ratings, they can’t even update the network schedule to accurately reflect it?"
10496,2020-09-04 19:36:31,imf97c,Any pre game going on? Nothing on NBCSN or FSSW

10537,2020-09-04 20:21:20,imf97c,Atrocious defense so far.
10538,2020-09-04 20:21:39,imf97c,What the hell was Klingberg doing?
10539,2020-09-04 20:22:28,imf97c,Don’t like the zone time the Kadri line is getting. We are lettting them setup and turn it into a 5v5 PP
10540,2020-09-04 20:22:29,imf97c,We need to settle down.. lots of gaps in the defense right now
10541,2020-09-04 20:22:42,imf97c,Love the energy in offensive zone. Much better than the last game. Keep it up and keep firing away
10542,2020-09-04 20:24:40,imf97c,Good to see Janmark isn’t seriously hurt

10549,2020-09-04 20:28:12,imf97c,Even the avs were confused about sekera going in behind the net
10550,2020-09-04 20:28:19,imf97c,Big rig why
10551,2020-09-04 20:28:26,imf97c,Definitely concerned about Khudobin early here but that’s also just a real bad turnover. Like real bad.
10552,2020-09-04 20:28:31,imf97c,Why do we have to GRIND for goals and then they get them on command
10553,2020-09-04 20:28:33,imf97c,if we give the puck away at our own blue line again i’m going to off myself
10554,2020-09-04 20:28:39,imf97c,Oleksiak hunny what is you doing

10556,2020-09-04 20:29:18,imf97c,They needed a bit of revenge for that Makar flub.
10557,2020-09-04 20:29:47,imf97c,Fucking amateur hour on that turnover.
10558,2020-09-04 20:30:36,imf97c,Giving up two bad goals in game 7 is less than ideal
10559,2020-09-04 20:31:14,imf97c,Good work Hanley!
10560,2020-09-04 20:31:47,imf97c,How do I listen to the ticket online?
10561,2020-09-04 20:32:29,imf97c,THAT WAS A HOLD?!
10562,2020-09-04 20:33:03,imf97c,Are defence is playing scared and it’s costing us. They’ve adapted and are putting way more pressure on our defence causing us to make more mistakes.
10563,2020-09-04 20:34:22,imf97c,"Time for a shorty... let's go, boys!"
10564,2020-09-04 20:35:07,imf97c,"Avs already pulled Hutch to allow for an extra skater, they are desperate to get the edge and a more comfortable lead here.  They are trying to put Dallas into a hole early (like game 5) that should wake everyone up.  Bones and the whole team should be thinking about everything they can do to get an edge."
10565,2020-09-04 20:37:27,imf97c,Good kill
10566,2020-09-04 20:37:50,imf97c,We need to get some better shots on net than these lame ducks from the blue line

10571,2020-09-04 20:47:25,imf97c,When Miro gets his fat ass contract with us I’m getting a jersey. Dude is so fun to watch

10577,2020-09-04 21:10:46,imf97c,BFC is good line. Wish Benn didn’t get the pay he did I quite like him in that role.

10582,2020-09-04 21:15:41,imf97c,weeeaaaak they did the same thing to us like 30 seconds ago. so maybe not weak but call them for the same shit
10583,2020-09-04 21:15:52,imf97c,We scored and the rain stopped where I live. Fucking incredible
10584,2020-09-04 21:16:38,imf97c,Dumb penalty but shit we breathe wrong and it’s a penalty. Call it both ways ref.
10585,2020-09-04 21:17:01,imf97c,Do we just have a double barrel shotgun at our feet when we score? Because these penalties are killing us.
10586,2020-09-04 21:17:32,imf97c,Yasssss Sekera. Block that thang
10587,2020-09-04 21:18:03,imf97c,Take stupid penalties win stupid prizes. What a fucking joke after we tie it
10588,2020-09-04 21:18:34,imf97c,Fuck you !kadri. Isn't it about time for you to do something inexplicably stupid to get yourself suspended?
10589,2020-09-04 21:18:38,imf97c,Too many men in the crease for my liking
10590,2020-09-04 21:18:47,imf97c,Can’t be taking penalties boys.
10591,2020-09-04 21:20:26,imf97c,Taking penalties has cost us so much...
10592,2020-09-04 21:22:29,imf97c,If you don't have the killer instinct / clutch factor / overwhelming will to win. YOU WON'T WIN. Pittsburgh didn't win 2 in a row because of dumb luck. Teams like that fucking finish.
10593,2020-09-04 21:22:36,imf97c,So many fucking penalties

10832,2020-09-04 20:29:47,imf97c,"We are only setting up shots from the line, but we have all of our best luck scoring up close, so...?"
10833,2020-09-04 20:30:12,imf97c,"Well I'm the biggest Dobby defender here, but he needs to be better.  Really need to get both of those."

10994,2020-09-04 21:41:31,imf97c,Wish rads would have taken a second on that. He had two other on the zone.
10995,2020-09-04 21:42:01,imf97c,That whistle blew before the goalie even had it.
10996,2020-09-04 21:45:44,imf97c,Good look boys
10997,2020-09-04 21:47:02,imf97c,Hintz was open why didn’t we give it to him. Ugh

11000,2020-09-04 21:57:16,imf97c,I feel like this is those 2 bloos series this is the team to go on. Just needs to happen now.
11001,2020-09-04 21:59:45,imf97c,"Y'all, I think Bones benched Benn and Seggy. For real."
11002,2020-09-04 22:01:16,imf97c,That sequence at the end of the second. Come out with that SAME FUCKING ENERGY.
11003,2020-09-04 22:09:23,imf97c,Those need to go in the net
11004,2020-09-04 22:09:25,imf97c,Benn...hit the net!
11005,2020-09-04 22:10:25,imf97c,do they not realize that it’s all or nothing right now?

11010,2020-09-04 22:15:58,imf97c,I’m over rads.
11011,2020-09-04 22:16:15,imf97c,Rads is the worst at trying to play off a penalty. He always makes himself look guilty even if it wasn’t that bad to begin with
11012,2020-09-04 22:16:23,imf97c,It's starting to hurt boys.
11013,2020-09-04 22:16:33,imf97c,I can’t take this game anymore. Just gonna follow the game thread. Getting migraines 😣
11014,2020-09-04 22:16:57,imf97c,STAY OUT OF THE FUCKING BOXXXX!
11015,2020-09-04 22:17:12,imf97c,Our scrappiness is just stupidity. Yet another off the puck moronic penalty.
11016,2020-09-04 22:17:49,imf97c,Shorty incoming
11017,2020-09-04 22:18:24,imf97c,"Gotta say, early in this series when we were hearing about how much of an advocate Bowness is for his players I was thinking, ""well, if he gets them to the Conference Finals maybe he deserves the gig full-time."" But ever since things have tanked they keep cutting to him losing his cool on the bench and man is that not a good look for an NHL coach. Maybe I'm just spoiled from the Tippett years where someone would score on us and it'd cut to him looking mustache-y but otherwise unfazed."
11018,2020-09-04 22:18:33,imf97c,We are still hesitant to press the attack. Our D is retreating way too early to try and prevent Mac from getting a rush on them.  At some point we gotta forget about golden boy and crash the net.
11019,2020-09-04 22:18:41,imf97c,"Good clear, this is stressful"
11020,2020-09-04 22:19:57,imf97c,Huge fucking kill. Let's get a greasy one
11021,2020-09-04 22:20:08,imf97c,FINALLY
11022,2020-09-04 22:20:08,imf97c,Amazing how stars score on their only PP beginning of the game and the refs swallow their whistles like they’re swallowing Mac’s seed.
11023,2020-09-04 22:20:20,imf97c,They look stunned that they got called for something
11024,2020-09-04 22:20:21,imf97c,Please do something here
11025,2020-09-04 22:20:24,imf97c,Alright let’s get a PP goal
11026,2020-09-04 22:20:28,imf97c,BIG PP ENERGY

11341,2020-09-04 20:17:31,imf97c,God damn mother fuckers
11342,2020-09-04 20:17:40,imf97c,Pavelski couldn't have screened Khudobin harder if he was trying
11343,2020-09-04 20:18:07,imf97c,That was a weak af goal
11344,2020-09-04 20:18:10,imf97c,Nice tip. Fuck the avs
11345,2020-09-04 20:18:14,imf97c,"Damn, that was a good deflection."

11358,2020-09-04 20:28:18,imf97c,Motherfucker that was a terrible giveaway
11359,2020-09-04 20:28:32,imf97c,Pain is all I've known with this team.

11364,2020-09-04 20:29:14,imf97c,absolutely egregious turnover
11365,2020-09-04 20:29:15,imf97c,I'm so depressed. This is so sad.
11366,2020-09-04 20:29:18,imf97c,Could we maybe not make it easier for them?
11367,2020-09-04 20:29:38,imf97c,"It’s do or die here, pick it the fuck up boys"
11368,2020-09-04 20:30:48,imf97c,Sekera backed himself in too. Clean up the passes boys
11369,2020-09-04 20:32:34,imf97c,Come on. We cant be getting outworked in our own zone
11370,2020-09-04 20:33:26,imf97c,The crescendo will be a PP goal against:
11371,2020-09-04 20:34:09,imf97c,Weak call
11372,2020-09-04 20:34:17,imf97c,Dallas looks terrible.
11373,2020-09-04 20:37:52,imf97c,We can’t even score when gifted the puck alone in front of their net.
11374,2020-09-04 20:37:52,imf97c,EVERYTHING FROM THE POINT
11375,2020-09-04 20:40:20,imf97c,I love our defensive strategy of just not playing defence
11376,2020-09-04 20:41:53,imf97c,We need some more of that o-zone time....
11377,2020-09-04 20:42:22,imf97c,defenseman playing 25 minutes? Those are rookie numbers
11378,2020-09-04 20:42:38,imf97c,Our forecheck is better today but we need something more solid than dump and forecheck
11379,2020-09-04 20:47:26,imf97c,I should have ordered Little Caesars this afternoon instead of Dominos.

11384,2020-09-04 21:11:30,imf97c,Another turnover in our own zone

12156,2020-09-04 20:28:37,imf97c,Here comes the 3-1 loss
12157,2020-09-04 22:51:22,imf97c,I PREDICT SEKERA WITH THE GWG FOR MAX MIXED EMOTIONS
12158,2020-09-04 20:15:55,imf97c,Alright how many seconds until the Avs tie it?
12159,2020-09-04 20:25:14,imf97c,Can we stop with the pathetic wrist shots from the blue line? Especially when there's no one in front.
12160,2020-09-04 21:15:23,imf97c,I never understand why they still don't go on a power play even if we score on a delayed call.
12161,2020-09-04 21:21:05,imf97c,God we suck at these back and forth games.
12162,2020-09-04 22:48:42,imf97c,Breathe. Let's Go
12163,2020-09-04 14:29:20,imf97c,This is the moment that will make the big 3 look great or go down as chokers.  Let’s hope our boys get it done. I’m not ready for this to Dobbys last game in a stars sweater!
12164,2020-09-04 20:30:13,imf97c,Wow we are playing scared. Calm down boys!
12165,2020-09-04 20:45:19,imf97c,Perry...your dumb shit is gonna cost us more penalties we can’t take.
12166,2020-09-04 20:47:15,imf97c,15 shots... and 11 - 12 of them from the freaking blue line.
12167,2020-09-04 20:47:18,imf97c,fuck fuck fuck
12168,2020-09-04 20:53:39,imf97c,Can someone link the hit on Dobby? I missed it trying to entertain a 2 year old while watching.
12169,2020-09-04 21:17:56,imf97c,FUCK YOU JANMARK
12170,2020-09-04 22:11:55,imf97c,Great now Pierre is gonna ruin Nathan Mackinnon for everyone
12171,2020-09-04 22:16:02,imf97c,"Fuck off Radulov. You fucked up. Don't act incredulous, play until the fucking whistle."
12172,2020-09-04 22:17:29,imf97c,"We need a shorty. Deflate those fuckers. Calgary scored 30 of them or so on us, we must be due given the number of PPs they've had"
12173,2020-09-04 22:17:38,imf97c,That's a horrendous penalty to take. I'd be okay with Rads sitting after that. Maybe rads should just play first and second periods. I'd be okay with him never touching the ice in the third period
12174,2020-09-04 22:18:09,imf97c,He sees him and turns in to Rads to draw the penalty. Should have been a no call play on or a 4-4. Ridiculous.
12175,2020-09-04 22:32:31,imf97c,YOOOOOO
12176,2020-09-04 22:41:13,imf97c,Prayer circle for Raddy hatty in OT lfg
12177,2020-09-04 22:41:59,imf97c,"Honestly the way CO just peppered our net right after the commercial break, I’d have been fine if we just held the puck behind the net to send to OT. Regroup and carry momentum out of the intermission."
12178,2020-09-04 22:42:03,imf97c,Oh gosh following via notifs is killing me
12179,2020-09-04 22:50:39,imf97c,AAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
12180,2020-09-04 23:06:30,imf97c,I JUST CAME IN MY PANTS!
12181,2020-09-04 23:06:41,imf97c,WOOOOOOOO
12182,2020-09-04 21:31:30,imf97c,Lmao - how embarrassing for the Avs that it took 7 to beat us
12183,2020-09-04 20:35:13,imf97c,Silver lining: I'd rather get bounced by the Avs in game 7 (where they said we would never get) than get embarrassed by Vegas or Vancouver
12184,2020-09-04 13:19:34,imf97c,I'm ready to be disappointed. Go Stars!!
12185,2020-09-04 20:29:20,imf97c,Alright fuck this. I'll check back in the 3rd. This is just playing out how I expected. No point in watching it happen.
12186,2020-09-04 20:54:35,imf97c,So bad....why is our offense so invisible? Why are we not making the 3rd stringer play well? Mark my words. Whoever scores the next goal wins the game.
12187,2020-09-04 20:17:06,imf97c,"Lol. 

We’re fucked"
12188,2020-09-04 22:31:51,imf97c,GOAL!
12189,2020-09-04 23:01:19,imf97c,Omg my stomach is in knots
12190,2020-09-04 22:04:54,imf97c,"In all honesty, the Avs deserve it more than us - and have a much better chance against vgk/van in the next round. 
The top line, or should i say fuckkinnon - leads by example - and when he’s having a “bad” game, he drags his ass back into consideration with mucho determination. Something I can’t honestly say about *some* of our boys.
Stars have been great to take it this far don’t get me wrong, but the bipolar play, and can’t be fucked attitude won’t get the boys a cup."
12191,2020-09-04 20:35:09,imf97c,Depleted Avs team with AHL goalie....easily handling Stars originally up 3-1 in the series.  Checks out.  Blow this f*ing team up in the offseason.
12192,2020-09-04 21:19:54,imf97c,Dallas looks like they're just ready to go home
12193,2020-09-04 21:48:18,imf97c,"They just don't want it. If they only put in the effort for 90 seconds at a time, they're toast."
12194,2020-09-04 20:43:16,imf97c,[deleted]
12195,2020-09-04 20:23:28,imf97c,"Hoping it doesn’t keep up....but we are looking like the Stars last game. Not winning battles, not getting interior chances, allowing them to come back and score within minutes. We need to screw it on straight...ASAP!"
12196,2020-09-04 22:29:48,imf97c,Miss wide open net. CLUTCH FACTOR -20. Gotta fucking score 11/10 times in that situation if you want to win the cup.
12197,2020-09-04 20:28:27,imf97c,God fucking dammit
12198,2020-09-04 20:29:06,imf97c,this is gonna be a game we dominate but they score 5 on 15 shots isnt it?
12199,2020-09-04 21:12:41,imf97c,FUUUUK YA BB
12200,2020-09-04 21:18:23,imf97c,Miro....

12209,2020-09-04 22:27:05,imf97c,I refuse to have hope.
12210,2020-09-04 20:23:41,imf97c,"I know Pavelski already won gold in Olympic diving, but if he doesn’t dive on Dobby, you’d still have a 1 goal lead.  4/10 from the judges on that one"
12211,2020-09-04 20:47:58,imf97c,I’m happy that the guys are just so fucking sick of playing in the bubble so they can go home.
12212,2020-09-04 22:44:25,imf97c,Off topic but PES or FIFA?
12213,2020-09-04 20:44:49,imf97c,can't hold lead longer than two min. see y'all in December

12226,2020-09-04 18:25:35,imf97c,They are really going to play a game 7 instead of their regularly scheduled Burn Notice 😡😡😡
12227,2020-09-04 18:42:06,imf97c,">really going to play a game 7 instead of th

I'm guessing it has something to do with amount of rest time between games. The Vancouver game went late last night and they have to go to game 7 tomorrow night. Didn't look too close into the math but it's either that or something really important is on TV tonight (basketball, MLB... idk)"
12228,2020-09-04 20:49:47,imf97c,Also 15 seconds after it happens. Brought the face off back into the defensive zone when the puck was already at center ice.
12229,2020-09-04 23:29:32,imf97c,A PROPHET

12397,2020-09-04 21:53:04,imf97c,regardless of what happens this period for me it's whether he stays true to his word that bowness is just an interim coach. it's totally a nill move to make him head coach full stop after this
12398,2020-09-04 21:52:47,imf97c,I think it's over regardless.

12404,2020-09-04 22:13:12,imf97c,unfortunately for the stars it is
12405,2020-09-04 22:13:48,imf97c,"For kids, sure. For NHLers.... it shouldn't be."
12406,2020-09-04 22:14:01,imf97c,This is Dallas's bread and butter that rarely ever gets them anything in return. Just a delayed turnover
12407,2020-09-04 22:14:33,imf97c,If you're changing. Also if you're bottled up at the blue line dump and Chase is a common move to get around the bottle up. Unfortunately the Stars dump and Chase even when not bottled up at the blue line.

12419,2020-09-04 20:37:43,imf97c,Exactly. We can't blame the refs for our own impotency.

12458,2020-09-04 20:46:09,imf97c,We have played well too. It's not like we shit the bed here or something.

12569,2020-09-04 19:24:43,imf97c,"Best of luck with what you got going on. If no one else does, I will be ready with the ALL: CAPS celebration WHEN we win and move on to the WCF!"

12642,2020-09-04 21:58:54,imf97c,May be more Twitter drama from him. Honestly I was watching Seguin earlier and his skating looked labored. I think something is wrong with him.
12643,2020-09-04 22:03:52,imf97c,The idiot announcers kept talking about Seguin needing more ice time & WHY wasn’t he out there.  Cuz he doesn’t give a shit in ANOTHER Game 7!!  I predict they’ll get all fired up at the end of the 3rd AFTER they pull Dobby... a day late & a dollar short!!

12693,2020-09-04 21:38:34,imf97c,I mean the guy gets at least a partial breakaway in almost every game he plays. Just literally never finishes them.

12726,2020-09-04 20:06:06,imf97c,Hintz looks like he should be playing a prince about to turn king on some historical Netflix show.

12732,2020-09-04 20:34:55,imf97c,We’ve been better offensively but defensively speaking we could be better. Bad turnover led to them taking the lead
12733,2020-09-04 20:36:31,imf97c,"Bad, we keep turning the puck over for no reason at all. Blind passes, passing into tons of colorado traffic in the neutral zone. Just shite play with passes and puck possesion."
12734,2020-09-04 20:36:39,imf97c,Speed.
12735,2020-09-04 20:48:19,imf97c,"I don't think it's confidence, I think the wear and tear are just starting to show."

12793,2020-09-04 15:50:20,imf97c,"the ratings maybe. it's hard to get anyone except the core fans excited if you can't go to the games. i'm finding that to be the case myself. like, i'm watching the games, but it's tough to get very involved. when they win, i'm kinda happy, and when they lose it kinda sucks. this is the first year i haven't been to any playoff games since....sometime before 2008. it sucks, but it's not the same."

12888,2020-09-04 19:43:32,imf97c,I don't blaze but wow do I love watching this gif before every game.

12891,2020-09-04 20:08:51,imf97c,On USA on my tv. Guide says law and order but the game on if you go there.
12892,2020-09-04 20:08:07,imf97c,Just click USA it’s on but the network schedule isn’t updated
12893,2020-09-04 20:08:07,imf97c,It’s on USA network but listed as law & order
12894,2020-09-04 20:08:13,imf97c,I’m on YTTV and it’s on USA
12895,2020-09-04 20:08:28,imf97c,"It's on USA. If your guide shows Law & Order, just play it. The national anthems are on."
12896,2020-09-04 20:07:58,imf97c,It's live on USA network
12897,2020-09-04 20:07:59,imf97c,It there. It doesn't show up
12898,2020-09-04 20:08:00,imf97c,USA just turn the channel over there trust me.
12899,2020-09-04 20:08:32,imf97c,Try turning the channel on and see if that helps.
12900,2020-09-04 20:10:34,imf97c,nope and we likely won't until after the playoffs are over. maybe once we're out of the bubble in the scenario that we don't go all the way lol

12908,2020-09-04 20:45:37,imf97c,I like that plan
12909,2020-09-04 20:53:19,imf97c,Correct

12999,2020-09-04 21:04:18,imf97c,I think it has been an improvement. We are playing less sluggish and look pretty good in the offense zone. Plus 2 guys who have been pretty good all series are out.
13000,2020-09-04 21:06:57,imf97c,And maintain some discipline!!
13001,2020-09-04 21:57:37,imf97c,I would surmise for their lack of performance. But we need them balls out for the second second period. I bet we'll see them. Message sent.

13005,2020-09-04 21:28:50,imf97c,I’m guessing he’s not 100%
13006,2020-09-04 21:39:58,imf97c,I think he started to do better after Monty left. But that was a low bar.
13007,2020-09-04 21:38:51,imf97c,It's him
13008,2020-09-04 21:40:03,imf97c,He’s gotta be playing hurt. Remember unfit to play in round robin? And one of his interviews he pretty much admitted it.
13009,2020-09-04 20:48:22,imf97c,Agreed. They’ve taken big hits on their lineup and are still holding up a great fight.
13010,2020-09-04 21:01:48,imf97c,So if Dallas wins today the Avs deserved to move on?
13011,2020-09-04 21:44:29,imf97c,probably because they're not getting enough time on the ice...
13012,2020-09-04 21:45:09,imf97c,"No one has a clue how to play because this team has no solid leadership. I get that everyone loves Benn, but when push comes to shove he just doesn't shove like he used to."

13015,2020-09-04 20:30:02,imf97c,Fedun. Fedun and Cogliano are out. Kiviranta's in for Cogs.
13016,2020-09-04 20:29:57,imf97c,its almost as if playing aggressive and scoring goals leads to defensive liabilities

13046,2020-09-04 20:39:33,imf97c,The 2nd round has been our downfall every playoffs with this core. Winning would be massive for their confidence in future years

13048,2020-09-04 23:02:24,imf97c,ARE YOU CRAZY? WHERE'S YOUR CAPS????
13049,2020-09-04 22:09:32,imf97c,Don’t know why you’re being downvoted because it’s the truth. With the amount of injuries their team has there’s no excuse for us having to go to game 7 with them. On top of that we’re struggling with scoring on an AHL fucking goalie. We played great hockey but now it seems like the Avalanche has finally flipped their switch and their “best” seems to be better than ours.
13050,2020-09-04 20:38:07,imf97c,Don’t buy all the depleted squad hype.  We’ve got quite a few JV players out there as well.
13051,2020-09-04 21:50:08,imf97c,The idea that they “don’t want it” is one of the most ridiculous things ever. They’re obviously exhausted.
13052,2020-09-04 20:44:51,imf97c,"Geez, where does one begin to answer this question?"
13053,2020-09-04 20:24:33,imf97c,We haven’t spent 10 minutes in the penalty box yet. So we got that going for us.

13206,2020-09-04 21:41:13,imf97c,And literally you just need a few of those to go in to be an impact player. Damn man
13207,2020-09-04 21:57:19,imf97c,The duality of being a Stars fan

13216,2020-09-04 23:44:00,imf97c,could i call that a prediction??
13217,2020-09-04 20:51:20,imf97c,He hasn’t been confident on where the puck is for a couple of saves. Makes me nervous
13218,2020-09-04 20:59:22,imf97c,"there seems to be a correlation there, you should look into becoming housebroken :P"
13219,2020-09-04 21:12:07,imf97c,ITSA GOOD SHOW
13220,2020-09-04 21:59:58,imf97c,Oh I meant more on our net.
13221,2020-09-04 22:24:54,imf97c,"Next power play we get, you bet"
13222,2020-09-04 22:29:43,imf97c,"I know how this goes. I watch, they lose. Trust me I'm gone and won't be back. Win this fucking game Bois."
13223,2020-09-04 22:29:02,imf97c,Not planning on coming back. The win is too important.
13224,2020-09-04 22:29:15,imf97c,"Not back, not returning. Clutch up Bois."

13231,2020-09-04 20:16:30,imf97c,Thank you for your energy! Rads goal!!!
13232,2020-09-04 20:31:47,imf97c,Not if there was a round 2 game 7 in-between us
13233,2020-09-04 19:40:02,imf97c,Damn. No NHLN on YTTV
13234,2020-09-04 19:54:05,imf97c,Man. I hope Cogs is okay. FCC does a lot to keep the Avs at bay.
13235,2020-09-04 20:07:46,imf97c,That it is.... That. It. Is.
13236,2020-09-04 20:23:11,imf97c,"Agreed, just weird to see actually happen"
13237,2020-09-04 20:23:51,imf97c,"He went on a half assed forecheck offsides then, half assed it on the back check too."
13238,2020-09-04 20:30:01,imf97c,Was a little concerning how he handled that first chance for the Avs that was almost a goal. Might have been just early game nerves and he’ll settle in though.
13239,2020-09-04 20:33:55,imf97c,Was a bullshit call. That was good work on him. The ref is just a dipshit.
13240,2020-09-04 20:33:06,imf97c,Found it. Thanks
13241,2020-09-04 21:19:36,imf97c,it was definitely a penalty on janmarks part it's just frustrating when you watch the avs do the exact same thing and the refs all put their hands over their eyes
13242,2020-09-04 23:27:02,imf97c,"I did listen to it, thanks! Kick ass song"
13243,2020-09-04 22:39:25,imf97c,Really wish we would have picked up Jumbo at the deadline.
13244,2020-09-04 22:34:34,imf97c,I'll fuckin do it again
13245,2020-09-04 23:00:11,imf97c,I GOT 34 OZ OF WATER FOR GURI!
13246,2020-09-04 23:04:27,imf97c,WOW OK IM 14:52
13247,2020-09-04 20:34:36,imf97c,Or any star players really
13248,2020-09-04 21:28:12,imf97c,Stats aren’t everything. He has come up BIG when we’ve needed it.
13249,2020-09-04 21:31:30,imf97c,"Idk what PP kill you just saw, but Dobby was working hard. Tf outta here with the negativity."
13250,2020-09-04 16:34:09,imf97c,"Wow, just goes to show how little killer instinct this team has. Your playoff lives are on the line and you manage 17 shots on goal and 1 shot for every 10 minutes in the final 40."
13251,2020-09-04 20:09:17,imf97c,Fuck my life.  Thank you my patron saint.
13252,2020-09-04 20:09:19,imf97c,No penalties called on Colorado today confirmed
13253,2020-09-04 21:19:58,imf97c,Oh thank goodness. Thought they were calling another penalty on us
13254,2020-09-04 22:51:27,imf97c,"Well the game was a 6am start for me, so I need it."
13255,2020-09-04 22:42:58,imf97c,ONE GOAL IS ALL IT TAKES! PLEASE STARS! PLEASE! LETS FUCKING GO
13256,2020-09-04 22:46:35,imf97c,GOT IT!
13257,2020-09-04 22:48:30,imf97c,OKAY
13258,2020-09-04 22:43:04,imf97c,I DONT REDDIT MUCH WHILE WATCHING DURING THE SEASON. LETS FUCKING GO
13259,2020-09-04 22:59:00,imf97c,IT ALREADY DID
13260,2020-09-04 17:56:34,imf97c,"Hush. Every time I think we’re going to lose, we kill it, and every time I start to have hope, we shit the bed."
13261,2020-09-04 21:27:40,imf97c,The one we scored on at the very beginning of the game.
13262,2020-09-04 22:59:28,imf97c,SHIT SORRY THE OT HADN'T STARTED YET AND I WAS TOO NERVOUS.
13263,2020-09-04 22:43:02,imf97c,LOTS OF CAPS
13264,2020-09-04 23:06:31,imf97c,Pardon?
13265,2020-09-04 21:17:33,imf97c,Kivi wasn't on watch though. Hahaha!
13266,2020-09-04 22:29:22,imf97c,Good n you
13267,2020-09-04 22:43:32,imf97c,SHIT YOURE RIGHT MY BAD

13269,2020-09-04 21:05:42,imf97c,"We just need to use that time in the zone better. It’s there, but so close to being where we need it"
13270,2020-09-04 21:59:29,imf97c,"Especially with the shitty penalties they’ve taken, the guys are worn. Seems like you need everyone you’ve got out there."
13271,2020-09-04 21:42:43,imf97c,He's been so up and down in his time in Dallas. So far as I can tell there is no rhyme or reason.
13272,2020-09-04 21:39:27,imf97c,"This is our concern, Dude."
13273,2020-09-04 21:42:04,imf97c,"That is what I am thinking as well. I have to wonder, though, if an injured Seguin is better for the roster than a healthy backup."
13274,2020-09-04 20:38:01,imf97c,Difference between negative and a realist. This is a definite L
13275,2020-09-04 20:30:00,imf97c,He took a heavy high stick to the head last game and went into protocol
13276,2020-09-04 22:34:51,imf97c,/S
13277,2020-09-04 23:13:36,imf97c,my dudette.
13278,2020-09-04 21:19:01,imf97c,Right. All that means is if the other team touches it the play is stopped. We give up our goalie for a man advantage. Theres still no punishment for the penalty.
13279,2020-09-04 22:46:55,imf97c,MY BAD MY GUY. DIDNT KNOW
13280,2020-09-04 20:40:39,imf97c,Higher the climb farther the fall
13281,2020-09-04 21:52:42,imf97c,Hate this excuse. Colorado has played just as many games in this series.
13282,2020-09-04 21:57:51,imf97c,"They're exhausted? They are playing sloppy, low efficiency, dump and chase hockey. They are being out played, out skilled, and out coached.

No wonder they're exhausted..."
13283,2020-09-04 21:52:46,imf97c,Then they are not the better team.
13284,2020-09-04 22:17:15,imf97c,Tell him chumpy
13285,2020-09-05 18:27:01,imf97c,It aged really well too.
13286,2020-09-04 22:23:24,imf97c,Of course it did right after I said that hahaha
13287,2020-09-04 20:33:09,imf97c,I just have that feeling. Remember last game?
13288,2020-09-04 20:47:21,imf97c,"Tell em. Dunno why some of these dallas ""fans"" so convinced the past is this game. It's not. Today is today."
13289,2020-09-04 20:47:25,imf97c,What I mean is it doesn’t really seem like we are playing with much desperation compared to Colorado. If they lose they go home and it looks like they have no intention of that. I just don’t see the same fire from Dallas.
13290,2020-09-04 19:39:21,imf97c,He also said he was in no rush to take a new job opportunity this year.
13291,2020-09-04 23:55:58,imf97c,Finns = Wins
13292,2020-09-04 17:30:06,imf97c,dude i've has my account since i was in middle school and even with the stupid middle schooler name i'd be pretty upset losing it even just for all the stupid posts i've saved over the years. hope you can get back in soon
13293,2020-09-04 14:18:53,imf97c,"I get it brother. Totally strange, hope it gets cleared up soon."
13294,2020-09-04 20:43:34,imf97c,I'm not serious :)
13295,2020-09-04 23:18:12,imf97c,"BASED DOBBY WILL REWARD NATE FOR HIS SACRIFICE 

Fuck the Refs, obviously I speak of their missed calls against y’all and I know that goes both ways"
13296,2020-09-04 15:59:35,imf97c,"Oh yeah, he was a machine that series but the bad part is I think it wore him completely out for the Bloos series. This game is do or die though and I want everyone to go all out for 60 minutes though, not just him and if they all do...we win."
13297,2020-09-04 19:54:11,imf97c,Oh gotcha I misunderstood
13298,2020-09-04 22:55:42,imf97c,I JUST LIKE THE NICKNAME OF KIWI
13299,2020-09-04 21:17:01,imf97c,Is there a third option?
13300,2020-09-04 22:00:38,imf97c,"i agree, that's why i said whether or not he keeps bowness as head coach will decide how i feel about nill keeping his position. i also wouldn't be opposed to keeping him as the defensive or assistant coach"
13301,2020-09-04 23:28:19,imf97c,"My husband watches Formula 1, and I guess he just has the same affect as Kimi Raikonnen and Heikki Kovalainen. My husband assures me he is just extremely Finnish."
13302,2020-09-05 02:32:13,imf97c,"Dude, they've had key injuries literally all season long"
13303,2020-09-04 16:01:51,imf97c,"Thank you, you are a lifesaver!  It shows Law and Order and freaked me out."
13304,2020-09-04 16:05:09,imf97c,"this absolutely does not surprise me.

We'll probably see a scrolling banner:

""We apologize, but we are not interrupting your regularly scheduled Law and Order: SVU broadcast to bring you some ice sport things. We hope there is no OT and we can bring you back to your regularly scheduled Law and Order: SVU as soon as possible. Again, we apologize for the inconvenience."""
13305,2020-09-04 16:12:12,imf97c,Take a good luck nap!
13306,2020-09-04 21:02:09,imf97c,"Actually, one of my first questions when I started watching (game 2 of the Calgary series) was why we dumped a lot. Always stuck out to me as counterintuitive. It sounds like the staff have some reason to believe it's gonna work, and I trust them. I'm not well versed enough yet to know what's a good strategy and what's not, so I just say whatever comes to my mind and hope not to get downvoted lmao."
13307,2020-09-04 22:52:49,imf97c,TO DROP BOMBS BUT HE KEEPS ON FORGETTING
13308,2020-09-04 20:59:56,imf97c,I agree with you. It’s not over. It just feels closer to over than it did before the game started.
13309,2020-09-04 20:55:59,imf97c,"Yeah, I get really antsy when it's not a blowout, but we def have the talent to win. At this point, it's on our top guys to play like Dawgs, and the coaching staff to scrap the dump and chase."
13310,2020-09-04 19:27:59,imf97c,"I'm sitting through a class full of review stuff, which isn't helping speed up the time"
13311,2020-09-04 19:31:13,imf97c,"Down under 30! 29 to go, guys!!!"
13312,2020-09-04 19:42:35,imf97c,"I feel the exact same way. Never wish injury on any player/team (even hated rivals), but we HAVE to take advantage of their captain not playing (if he doesn't)."
13313,2020-09-04 20:24:54,imf97c,Dedication!
13314,2020-09-04 23:55:32,imf97c,YOU DID IT!!!!!! IT WAS ALL THANKS TO YOU
13315,2020-09-04 23:09:41,imf97c,GOOD LUCK CHARM PROFESSOR
13316,2020-09-04 21:58:10,imf97c,"Ay well, hopefully we put out the win."
13317,2020-09-04 22:09:52,imf97c,"No, it sucks watching the Stars play like they don’t give a shit!  I’m just glad I’m not watching this in person!"
13318,2020-09-04 19:13:52,imf97c,LOL. Jimmys for all!
13319,2020-09-04 22:53:40,imf97c,ALL GOOD MAN! LETS GO!!!
13320,2020-09-04 21:43:51,imf97c,Oh word.  Heard you
13321,2020-09-04 21:43:29,imf97c,"That has to reflect on Bowness.  I understand you can't always do what ya want, plans until you're punched in the mouth and all, but I remember when the Canes came into Dallas, we tried our ticky-tack ""who's got the puck?  Legs go brrrr"" style.  We looked fucking great for 20, and then Dallas adjusted to slow the game down and control a more east-west game.  All while bullying the Canes armada of 5'10 forwards.  Ffs if you can out harass the team that prides ourselves on being the annoying fast-paced forecheck guys, you can slow down the game a (relatively) slower team like the Avs."
13322,2020-09-04 17:02:13,imf97c,Tell her you'd like to return the favor by introducing her to a crippling addiction to hockey and have that wine over a game 7 between Central rivals
13323,2020-09-04 17:56:32,imf97c,Just fuck her quick and hell even bring her back to watch it with you.
13324,2020-09-04 21:33:08,imf97c,good point

13330,2020-09-04 19:55:05,imf97c,Yeah this is taking a weird turn
13331,2020-09-04 19:56:48,imf97c,well now it might be the FCK you line. still rolls off the tongue

13333,2020-09-04 20:25:07,imf97c,He hasn't been the same since Game 3....
13334,2020-09-04 21:23:27,imf97c,For sure. Totally agree. But as I am writing this...perry just took another stupid penalty.

13351,2020-09-04 20:41:33,imf97c,Guess we shouldn’t have even made the playoffs with that attitude
13352,2020-09-04 21:54:38,imf97c,They look fucking exhausted too lol both teams have had some spurts of speed and energy followed by a lull.
13353,2020-09-04 22:01:46,imf97c,"Sure. That’s all probably fairly valid criticism although I have an aneurysm every time someone bitches about dUmP aNd ChAsE but saying “they don’t want it” is fucking stupid. Also they woke up a lot in the last couple of minutes so there’s a silver lining. I just get sick of people bitching for a whole game, especially when we’re only down by one. A lot can still happen."
13354,2020-09-04 22:25:17,imf97c,You wanna talk about how Dallas can't score again so they'll take the lead?

13357,2020-09-04 23:22:16,imf97c,"agreed, the officiating was horrible pretty much the whole series"

13360,2020-09-04 21:07:28,imf97c,"we're a team with a lot of size and a lot of speed. Dump in forces their D to turn their backs to us and retrieve, which allows us with our size and speed to fly in and punish them. Force turnovers behind the net. Get goals like you see in the linked video.

&#x200B;

Over the course of 7 games, that punishment adds up. Half their defense has dropped out this series. The other half is always thinking twice when they go back there to retrieve. It's an effective strategy, especially in the playoffs where teams like St. Louis, Boston, and LA have bullied their way to the Stanley Cup in seasons past and we are built specifically for that style.

But its not flashy so the uneducated fans and people who love to bitch about everything do exactly that."

13391,2020-09-03 20:38:32,im0ep1,"There was nothing stereotypical about the Blade films.

I respectfully disagree with that point."
13392,2020-09-03 21:11:47,im0ep1,"It's quality also doesn't get enough respect.  Yeah it had some hiccups, but that scene with Killmonger and his dad was *brilliant*.  Reminds me of how Forrest Gump is mostly fun and well-done shmaltz, but then there's the ""But is he smart or is he..."" scene that just rips your heart out and on its own justifies the Oscar nod."
13393,2020-09-04 01:56:19,im0ep1,"Blade is a cool black superhero, but had he been a white guy, nothing would fundamentally change about his movie if you think about it. It's great, but when it comes to representation, Black Panther is on a whole other level.

A huge black cast that wears its culture with pride. A hero that's kind, noble and full of empathy. A far cry from a ""badass vampire hunter"" that (while cool) isn't much of an inspiration or role model. Millions of black men, women and children around the world were inspired by Black Panther, and to use Blade to downplay Panther's achievements like half of Reddit does is disingenuous at best and it pisses me off whenever I see it."
13394,2020-09-04 02:39:59,im0ep1,"I think that's an important distinction to make. Blade was an early superhero movie with a Black lead, but it wasn't specifically interested in racial issues and inequality in the same way Black Panther was. I love Blade, but it doesn't have the thematic richness that helped make Black Panther such an incredible superhero film."
13395,2020-09-04 02:47:41,im0ep1,"First off, I'm black and have almost certainly been a serious reader of Black Panther since before you were alive. Since his comic was called Jungle Action, since Tcharlie as he was nicknamed in the çomics, was a high school teacher in the US.

So I am the last person on earth that would disparage Black Panther. He's been my idol since 79.

Now that we have that straight, no where in my comment did I compare the two heroes.

I said and I will repeat, Blade was not a stereotype.

That has ZERO to do with Panther, Spawn, Static Shock, Black Lightning or any other black hero that has reached mass media.

It is an isolated comment about Blade and Blade only.

I appreciate your fervor, but you are definitely barking up the wrong tree, with those comments of yours.

Agreed on LaMelo at 1 I don't think Edwards is as seamless of a fit as people are portraying it.

Also love seeing Jessup in the top 60. He's an interesting ""pre-stash"" guy and one of the best shooters in the class."

Another week it’s Anthony Edwards. One week they like James Wiseman. Another week they like Onyeka Okongwu more than Wiseman. I think there is some truth to some of the stuff being thrown out there, but that front office does tend to be very talkative, and the Warriors know what they are doing when they talk to reporters. The front office started the smoke screen process earlier than anyone else this year, using its willingness to engage with reporters to its advantage.

This has been my thought from the start. The warriors had zero incentive to tip off reporters about what direction they are leaning, but people were taking these rumors as gospel. 

Trading back and getting Okongwu, Deni, Okoro, Vassell...etc always made the most sense to me. Ball and Edwards have a lot of upside, but Curry is in his prime and they dont have a lot of time to waste by waiting around for kids to develop."

But the Celtics have so many things to be settled before the draft (I assume they will have a very good idea on opt-ins even if that deadline remains a day after the draft), and flexibility with three picks, that it is tough to project. If draft and stash is a big part of their strategy, seems like using the second-rounder on Yam Madar or Filip Petrusev might be a better fit."

I don't get the fit next to Luka -- he'll kill the spacing (unless that 3PT% stats dont tell the whole story), he doesn't seem to have the size/athleticism to be an elite defender, his passing is nothing to write home about... so why?? Relatively small dudes who can get some buckets are a dime a dozen...

How's he a better fit than let's say Trey Burke -- especially now that Burke is working hard to defense...?"
13433,2020-09-03 17:32:23,ilxboo,"Agree about Edwards, I'd rather explore trade down options before taking him at 1 if I'm Rosas. Would rather have a wing/forward that will compliment Towns and Russell better, plus additional bench depth/a pick next year."
13434,2020-09-03 17:52:10,ilxboo,Terry at 34 is a fleece for us
13435,2020-09-03 21:46:20,ilxboo,"> Agreed on LaMelo at 1 I don't think Edwards is as seamless of a fit as people are portraying it.

He really isn't. I think most people are just assuming that he's a better fit than Ball (a PG when the Wolves already have DLo) or Wiseman (a C when the Wolves already have KAT) because he's a SG. 

However, even ignoring the issues with defense and motor, Edwards did the majority of his scoring out of pure iso plays, he didn't do much as a scorer or passer out of the pick-and-roll, and he was a bad spot-up shooter (only 28.9% shooting on catch on shoot jumpers). The lack of P&R ability makes him a poor fit with KAT, and the lack of catch and shoot ability makes him a poor fit with DLo."
13436,2020-09-03 20:46:08,ilxboo,"Probably just BPA with regard to Scrubb. It’s the late second round so just a crapshoot at that point, no need to worry about fit."
13437,2020-09-03 21:17:44,ilxboo,Same. I've been watching him since he was a freshman at Kansas and said he'd be really good in a Spurs uniform one day. Not to mention Timmy mentoring him would be a plus.
13438,2020-09-03 19:28:00,ilxboo,"Same, i would maybe prefer Woodard or Bane with the Clippers pick, but im good with Hughes too"
13439,2020-09-03 20:25:24,ilxboo,I'd probably prefer Terry with the clippers pick but I do love Hughes for the skills and his intangibles. Idk about Nico Mannion tho
13440,2020-09-05 02:40:05,ilxboo,"According to this we’d have the opportunity to walk away with Hayes, Bane, Nico/Riller.  Yes please"
13441,2020-09-03 19:27:43,ilxboo,Man Williams at 11 and Riller at 41 would be incredible. Two guys who could (hopefully) fill the spots of Rudy and Patty over the next few years.
13442,2020-09-04 01:55:13,ilxboo,Ive been watching tillie since last year and hope we can get him. I think we need more skill in a back up center if Jakob is going to be our starter
13443,2020-09-03 21:19:42,ilxboo,"I honestly feel he could be more than Clint Capela. He is a beast though, which I agree."
13444,2020-09-05 11:29:52,ilxboo,Honestly I rather just trade up and get Tyler Bey.
13445,2020-09-04 05:32:38,ilxboo,I was a little confused too that Terry just miraculously fell to 34 for us here
13446,2020-09-03 18:32:23,ilxboo,"He says they prioritize him and Deni and if Avdija isn't available, they're going for him. Also points out that it will make their league-worse defense even more terrible, apparently they don't care."
13447,2020-09-03 20:36:52,ilxboo,okoro is the perfect guy
13448,2020-09-04 03:59:50,ilxboo,I think Sexton and Okoro are friends so I wouldn’t be surprised if he’s there the Cavs take him. Fits exactly what they’re looking for defensively as well.
13449,2020-09-04 01:50:49,ilxboo,"Just curious, what’s the knock on him? Everything I’ve heard seems to indicate he’ll be great offensively, and sure his defense isn’t great but that matters less and less it seems"
13450,2020-09-03 20:47:31,ilxboo,Why not? He projects as the best overall offensive prospect in the draft.
13451,2020-09-04 20:51:39,ilxboo,"Having Bridges, Cam Johnson, and Vassell locked in for a long time would be awesome. All those guys do is make positive contributions.

I have a dream of watching those three in a lineup with ayton and Booker playing point for stretches"
13452,2020-09-03 22:07:15,ilxboo,"Passing on Edwards for Okongwu and Okoro for the sake of short-term investment doesn’t make sense to me. All of them are equally risky, being extremely young and underdeveloped in certain important areas of their game"
13453,2020-09-03 20:45:10,ilxboo,Let's get weird with it.
13454,2020-09-04 01:33:07,ilxboo,"I loooove Terry/Malachi/Joe in the 2nd, I’d rate all those guys as late first prospects.

I don’t know enough about RJ Hampton to really have thoughts on him, but I’d rather Desmond Bane there, or trade up to 18 or 19 for Maxey or Cole. If either of those guys or Kira drops close to our pick, I think it’s worth a trade up provided we give up one early 2nd.

Also wish we would’ve nabbed Riller at one of those 2nd round picks, but Vecenie is clearly much lower on him than I am."
13455,2020-09-04 01:29:58,ilxboo,"Makes no sense to me. I get him not being a lottery pick or anything, but he’s perfect in the 20’s as instant bench offense for a contender. If he drops out of the 1st, I’d be shocked to see him get passed the Sixers couple picks in the early 2nd."
13456,2020-09-03 23:13:25,ilxboo,Do you like picking Udoka there even with some of the other guys who are still on the board in this scenario?
13457,2020-09-03 22:55:41,ilxboo,"What does Tillman do for the Cs that they don't have enough of? I would think (but obviously not sure) that if they pick up a big in the draft it's either someone who can shoot from the outside, not being completely sold on Grant there, or someone who can bang with 7 footers in the post when necessary, as Kanter has one more year on his"
13458,2020-09-03 19:21:41,ilxboo,"Logic dictates PG or C, but maybe it's that Okoro has the most upside from who's left. Maybe they move up, where there are higher upside players who fit their needs, or move down the pick to get 2 or more (like suggested on this sub a few weeks ago, possibly with BOS) where they can fit more needs

Edit: revisited the article to see the explanation, basically he pins it to the new GM who was in OKC prior, where they valued athletic, hard working wings, regardless of their shooting ability. He's assuming it will carry on to DET."
13459,2020-09-04 00:49:13,ilxboo,"I think the idea is that because OKC always seemed to draft the most  athletic wing available, Troy Weaver will do it in Detroit too."
13460,2020-09-03 20:19:34,ilxboo,"I'm not high on Delon, plus he has 2 years/$17.5M remaining, compared to any PG you'd take at #15, on a 4-year/$15.765M deal (based on original predictions, will probably be lower) with 2 team options. I guess if they like Wright and want maybe Jalen Smith they can go for it, but that means you have 48 minutes of non-shooting PG. Dallas would probably take it, as Wright was completely out of rotation in the playoffs, plus at #15 they can get a quality wing (probably)."
13461,2020-09-03 22:56:44,ilxboo,"Doesn't Kanter have another year on his deal? He signed a 2 year contract. Wanamaker is on the minimum now and should make more elsewhere so I don't expect him to be back, but there are candidates to take his minutes on the roster now. None of them have looked very good at PG this season, but Carsen, Tremont Edwards, and Romeo might all get a shot at some 3rd string PG minutes if only to see what the team has there. If the team takes Poku / Bolmaro, I'm not 100% that the strategy is draft and stash - Poku could use professional NBA strength training for one - but instead to take big risks in hopes of hitting on a star because the roster is so well filled out otherwise."

13464,2020-09-05 13:57:49,ilxboo,"What?

Burke isn’t a good defender. Maxey is a very good one. Saying Maxey doesn’t have the athleticism to be a good defender makes me think, or makes me know that you’ve never watched Maxey tape. He’s a very good athlete.

He was considered one of the best shooters in the class before the cal system hurt him.

Lots of Kentucky players go to the pros and become very good at things where they either limited by system or just weren’t allowed to at all.

Bam wasn’t handling at Kentucky 
Booker was mainly considered a spot up shooter
KAT didn’t shoot at all and now he’s the best stretch big in the league, could be all time level in that regard.

And theoretically the fit next to luka would be great. His great POA defense would be a major help next to luka. He would be a secondary playmaker, able to create for others & himself. If there’s the change from the flashes he’s shown that he becomes a pretty good shooter then the Mavericks no doubt got a steal at 18"
13465,2020-09-03 22:14:23,ilxboo,Edwards still has the most likelihood of becoming a superstar out of anyone in this draft imo. I think the fit might not be perfect but it might actually be better than people think. I see a real possibility that LaMelo simply struggles like Lonzo and doesn’t have great value after he starts to see playing time and so trading him later on seems like a losing proposition.
13466,2020-09-04 13:12:07,ilxboo,I don’t think there’s a chance he’s still available at 41. I think he’s a FRP
13467,2020-09-04 03:42:03,ilxboo,"Laterally he seems very slow, which makes him unplayable in the pick and roll.  Offensively he seems like he has good hands and he can establish position early."
13468,2020-09-03 20:16:44,ilxboo,None of the Athletic writers have any sources within the Cavs anymore so I wouldn't worry about it.   Toppin won't be their pick.  Thanks for posting the mock.
13469,2020-09-04 02:20:14,ilxboo,That's grim if they don't care about defence at all. I'd question what his sources are on that though.

13472,2020-09-04 00:19:31,ilxboo,"I worry a lot about Obi on offence. Just look at him in the post, absolutely no finesse or technical ability, he scores because he was 22 and far stronger than the weak bodied college kids.

I was higher on him but as i had nothing to do i really deep dived his game. I don't think his shot is particularly great, he is bad at putting it on the floor and even in the half court he looks sluggish.

He was put in a simple offsenive system where he could easily score against weaker defenders in PnR and in the Post.

His offensive game is flawed and his defence is atrocious. I think it is absolute lunacy to take him high in this draft."

13476,2020-09-04 02:18:47,ilxboo,"Not really, both O’s have respectable floors as winning defense-first, high energy role players which is great for a team in the Warriors position. Theyve fit guys like Mckinnie and Jordan Bell into the rotation on championship teams. 

The problem with Ball and Edwards is that in the short term they may just be negatives on the court when it comes to playoff basketball because of their lack of defense and questionable habits"
13477,2020-09-04 03:46:35,ilxboo,"I agree with these takes. RJ I'm not too high on and I would rather trade up in the range to have a chance at Maxey/Kira/Cole. I really would like to trade up this year. Also wish we git Riller, I'd take him before Flynn tbh. Riller is a 1st round talent."
13478,2020-09-04 02:00:03,ilxboo,"On his big board (updated yesterday) he has him at 26. He's said in the past he's higher on him than most and has a first round grade on him. Must be hearing something to consistently mock him in the mid 40s

e: Had him going 48 in his mock the day after the lottery, and 47 back in July.  Meanwhile on his big board, which usually comes out around the same time as his mock, Riller has been bouncing between 25 and 26."
13479,2020-09-03 23:27:51,ilxboo,Can’t lie and say that I’ve seen him but the description is that he can defend the post and communicates constantly on defense too. Not great on perimeter but knows his strengths and weaknesses. Can pass and makes right read on offense. Doesn’t this feel like an easy fit for the Celtics?

13482,2020-09-03 20:39:53,ilxboo,"I'd have to agree with you. I don't think it's any secret that the Magic are looking for guards, but I think Delon would work well with them. From what I've seen, he's a player that does a lot better with a defined role. He's a distributor with plus defense. We have a surplus of distributors. I think he would work decently in the Magic system. It's all about how they value Aminu. He's dealt with injuries and they seem to be perpetual purgatory with 6'7-7'0 bigs with thin PG Depth. I don't think anyone they'd target at 15 would be gone at 18 and Delon could be an insurance pick up if nothing else. They also have the same contract length with Delon getting a 1.5 less in their final contract year"

I know people are low on this draft, but almost all the top prospects have specialized skill sets that I can see them excelling with if they’re placed in a role that doesn’t ask too much of them. It’s unlikely that these guys will be stars from Day 1 like Zion and Morant, but solid role players? Absolutely"
13486,2020-09-04 02:26:37,ilxboo,"You can be negative on the floor by being a non-contributor on offense as well. I don’t know why people always assume it’s only a problem if you’re a poor defender and not the inverse. 

Not sure why you’re bringing up McKinnie and Bell either. There’s not really a point in being high-energy if you’re a bad defender, which was especially true in McKinnie’s case. In fact, he was so bad that he couldn’t even win a job as Glenn Robinson’s backup last season and got promptly cut after training camp. That’s not going to be what the Warriors are hoping for out of a top-3 pick.

As it stands Okoro is a non-shooter who generated a majority of his offense at PF at 6’6 and 220-pounds. Okongwu doesn’t really have a translatable offense to the NBA outside of catching lobs and rim-running. There’s much fewer questions for Edwards improving on defense than for Okoro and Okongwu to magically become even average offensive players in their rookie year"
13487,2020-09-04 02:01:07,ilxboo,"Oh damn, I must’ve missed that. That’s also what I like a lot about his mocks, he seems to have solid info about what team’s are interested in and it’s really useful for projecting where guys might actually go."

13490,2020-09-05 14:50:31,ilxboo,Timelord has the ability to roll and protect the rim. I also buy Grant as a 1 on 1 interior defender in the future because he's crazy strong.

They also love MCW and wouldn't be surprised if they resign him, which makes Wright a bit redundant."
13492,2020-09-04 03:44:54,ilxboo,">Not sure why you’re bringing up McKinnie and Bell either.

I literally said it lol. If the Warriors have won championships with those guys in the rotation, then they’d feel comfortable with Okoro (Mckinnie role) or Okongwu (Bell role) sliding in and playing playing their roles.

>As it stands Okoro is a non-shooter who generated a majority of his offense at PF at 6’6 and 220-pounds. 

Which is okay with the Warriors spacing and movement. He’s a great cutter, screener, can offensive rebound, terror in transition. He can fill a role on offense. Just because he’s not a shooter doesn’t mean he’s a negative offensively

>Okongwu doesn’t really have a translatable offense to the NBA **outside of catching lobs and rim-running.**

Which can make you a positive on offense. Especially considering Steph and Klay’s gravity

To my larger point. I can’t see how you would think Edwards or Ball arent “riskier” for a team like the Warriors when they both play no defense and have shot selection and effort concerns. The whole point of trading back would be to get a guy like either O or Vassell who they have confidence in plugging into smaller roles, while also getting another asset/rotational player"
13493,2020-09-04 00:13:10,ilxboo,"If the Celtics can grab a 21 year old Theis that can grow with their young nucleus, I can't imagine they wouldn't. However, that would mean they see Tillman as a future Theis which who knows if they do."
13494,2020-09-04 19:18:56,ilxboo,"Is there anyone in this draft you think is able to help against those guys? Maybe include Bam.

That's a portion, I imagine, of the attraction to Azubuike. If he reaches his ceiling, he can. Wiseman and maybe Achiuwa (also 6'9"") are the other options in this draft, I think."
13495,2020-09-05 21:24:16,ilxboo,"Timelord doesn’t have the positioning, passing or bball Iq of Tillman eithee"
13496,2020-09-04 04:01:13,ilxboo,"You can’t be seriously thinking the Warriors are trying to find a McKinnie and Bell with a top draft pick. McKinnie was awful for the Warriors and they were forced to play him only because injuries forced their hand. And where are you coming up with this narrative that either contributed heavily in their championship run? Bell averaged under 9 minutes a game in postseason and was straight up inactive for half of their games. Similar story with McKinnie. 

The Warriors can find a wing who’s a good cutter, screener, and rebounder for the veteran minimum. That was literally McKinnie’s role on the team, who got cut for all his effort because that’s all he offered.

With Okongwu, similarly, the Warriors can find rim-running and lob-catching from any random center off the street. That’s literally Chriss’s role on the team, who not to mention is more athletic and offensively skilled than a 19-year old Okongwu. Why would they draft a center in the top-10 to be a poor man’s Chriss as a rookie?

What’s important for a NBA GM with a top-3 pick is understanding the concept of value, which I don’t think you’re quite comprehending. Drafting a player with a top-3 pick solely for the purpose of filling a role that had historically been filled by second-round picks and undrafted players would be a hilariously awful mismanagement of resources. Veteran minimum contracts exist for a purpose. Top-3 draft picks exist for another purpose. And with the Warriors willingness to buy in on another former “bad shot-selection bad defense” experiment with Wiggins, I think they’ll be much more confident in Edwards’s ability to contribute than you. Which coincidentally is probably why every insider has been reporting that Edwards is #1 on their board"
13497,2020-09-04 00:19:53,ilxboo,"I’d love to see the trio of Theis, Time Lord and Tillman"

13499,2020-09-04 21:56:50,ilxboo,"Not really a huge concern with Bam picking someone apart in the post. I think because of the rarity of super elite post players in the NBA, defending it won't be something the Celtics prioritize in the draft highly."
13500,2020-09-05 21:26:34,ilxboo,"Timelord is actually a great passer and I think his bbiq is severely underrated - his problem isn't understanding the game, it's focusing on it completely. He also bites too often on pump fakes."
13501,2020-09-04 04:14:27,ilxboo,"Look all I’m doing is explaining the rationale behind trading back, I’m not saying the Warriors will or won’t do this. Your OP was:

>Passing on Edwards for Okongwu and Okoro for the sake of short-term investment doesn’t make sense to me. All of them are equally risky, being extremely young and underdeveloped in certain important areas of their game

And I just disagree that they’re all “equally risky”. Okoro/Okongwu/Vassell/Haliburton, those guys are tailor made role players right now basically. And then by trading back you presumably will get another piece for depth or another asset. They may choose this route over a Ball or Edwards who are notorious for defensive shortcomings and displaying habits that aren’t conducive to winning. I’m that sense theyre **riskier** than the other guys listed.

I brought up Mckinnie and Bell not to say they were huge contributors but that if they even got any PT as 2nd round/undrafted-type talents, then the Warriors would be really comfortable playing more gifted (and frankly higher IQ) guys like the O’s in those same roles.

You can disagree with the strategy or think it’s not optimal, but I was giving you the rationale as to why they might do it, and also refuting the notion that they’re all “equally risky”. Ball and Edawards can rightfully scare some ppl whereas some of those other guys down the board are more like coaches’ dreams."
13502,2020-09-04 00:22:52,ilxboo,"Maybe, but as a Celtics fan I don't really see the similarity between the two players. Theis is much more vertical than Grant."
13503,2020-09-06 05:43:13,ilxboo,"Timelord isn’t a great passer at this point. He has shown the ability to take the ball up the court and make a few nice reads, which is farther ahead then most bigs, but tillman is the far superior passer"
13504,2020-09-04 04:24:37,ilxboo,"The only possibility of Edwards being “riskier” than the field is if he has attitude problems and doesn’t buy in to being a role player. Sure, that’s a risk, but as an outsider, I’m not in position to comment on character. I trust the Warriors will perform a thorough background check on all players and they’ll be a much better judge of that than me.

But in terms of pure ability, Edwards is undoubtedly the safest pick to be a postseason contributor in his rookie season. He’s at least as offensively talented as guys like Okoro and Okongwu are defensively, and his athleticism and defensive flashes give him All-NBA Defense potential. It’s not a matter if he can develop given a few years like with Okoro’s shot, which is outside of his control. Edwards’s biggest flaws are purely a matter of want-to and will only exist as long as he allows them to"
13505,2020-09-04 00:33:32,ilxboo,"Theis does a better job with vertical contests and the like, but I bet their actual vertical leap is pretty similar."
13506,2020-09-07 02:37:16,ilxboo,He has shown the ability to not just make the obvious pass but the next one. I think he has a fair shot at it long term. Also Grant is at least Tillman's equal as a passer.
13507,2020-09-04 04:41:40,ilxboo,"My man Edwards is just not a high IQ player in general, it’s not just about  the “want-to”. On the ball when he puts in the effort yeah he’s a plus, but he’s a bad off-ball defender no matter what right now. I agree about the Warriors being confident in their coaching staff and player development, but it’s tough to say how quickly Edwards IQ would improve. 

The larger point I was getting about in terms of risk is that Okoro and Okongwu are plug-and-play positives; they wouldn’t have to change a thing about their games and they’d be helpful rotation players and could get minutes in the postseason. The risk with them is more in terms of upside (which may not concern the Warriors if they’re looking at a 2-4year window anyway).

Edwards/Ball, it’s a lot of projection and talking yourself into how they fit immediately; thats inherently risky. I actually think their upside is less risky, but the short term growing pains would be the issue. 

Not really gonna argue this point myself, but there was an article post on this sub where they interviewed multiple college coaches in the conference about the prospects... multiple SEC coaches favored Okoro to Edwards or pointed out that he affected winning more. Down the road maybe Edwards makes enough improvements to separate himself but **right now** you can argue Okoro helps you win more."
13508,2020-09-04 06:19:50,ilxboo,"Grant has an atrocious 31"" vertical. Theis is at least a little bouncy."
13509,2020-09-04 02:25:21,ilxboo,"Nah Theis is bouncy if a little undersized. He’s not Robert Williams athletic but he catches lobs, blocks shots, finished above the rim on dump-offs. Grant Williams plays woefully groundbound around the rim"
13510,2020-09-07 16:37:35,ilxboo,Grant is not his equal whatsoever. He was a complete black hole offensively for 95% of the year.
13511,2020-09-04 02:45:05,ilxboo,"Their rate based block numbers are relatively similar (1.8 v 1.2 / 36 min) and I attribute the difference more to Theis' superior sense of timing than raw athleticism. Honestly I think it's a huge credit to Theis' bbiq as much as anything. It's also a fairly common sight in Celtics games to see someone throw Theis a lob and him fail to dunk it. I love Theis, but he's probably among the league leaders in failed lobs per game"
13512,2020-09-07 23:51:02,ilxboo,"Black hole is a very weird descriptor to apply to Grant, to the point that I'm now questioning how much you've watched him play. There have certainly been times where Grant was a net negative offensively, but it was never the case that he was a black hole - [a player where the ball went into his possession and never came back out again, i.e. a selfish player or gunner](https://www.thestepien.com/2019/08/28/draft-notes-black-hole-apocalypse/). That is so far from how Grant has played and occasionally been bad. Grant overthinking things offensively and he passing up open shots because he isn't confident, those are the times he's offensively at his worst."
13513,2020-09-04 02:52:18,ilxboo,"Like I said he’s not Robert Williams athletic and he’s a little undersized while not being very long. The fact that he even blocks shots and finishes above the rim at all is a testament to his ups and even if theyre not spectacular, he’s undoubtedly bouncier than Grant Williams at the least. Grant will prob finish less than 5 lobs his whole career lol"
13514,2020-09-08 00:27:22,ilxboo,"That article says he thought Collins was a black hole. Not even comparative to williams. It’s a site looking at draft notes, not using their own independent definition to analyze nba players. Williams can’t shoot, and he can’t really be used as a roller much because he has almost zero vertical pop. He is an ok passer for a big man sure but his passiveness and lack of usage means that it’s not gonna be shown enough. The one real positive thing he does is set nice screens, and there’s a lot of bigs out there who can screen but also be a good roller unlike williams"
13515,2020-09-04 03:11:14,ilxboo,"There are some legit impressive blocks in his [rookie highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rPKHDanF64) and a couple of dunks that are nice. Offensively, he's a much better perimeter player than he is in the dunker spot. Like you said, he's very much not a vertical threat, but I think with confidence and timing we'll see a little more from him. I think Theis could outjump Grant, but that the margin is relatively small and certainly not enough to stop Grant from inhabiting that type of role."
13516,2020-09-08 00:46:26,ilxboo,"I'm just using it as an example of the commonly accepted definition, not a metric. 

None of what you said, whether I agree or disagree, points to Grant Williams being a black hole offensively. Did you have him confused with another player?"
13517,2020-09-04 03:24:48,ilxboo,">I think Theis could outjump Grant, but that the margin is relatively small and certainly not enough to stop Grant from inhabiting that type of role.

Hmm I just disagree, Theis is pretty functional as a rim runner/diver because of his bounce. Grant will never be able to fill that role extensively because he’s so ground bound. Theis had 81 dunks (to Grant’s 5) this year, so over 1/gm and in his somewhat limited minutes. Its a pretty big part of his identity as a player

I agree Grants had some impressive contests at the rim but he’s so heavy he usually needs a wind up. He’s also about 2” shorter. He’s a 4 that can spend some time at the 5 but he’s fundamentally gonna full a different role than what Theis does for them."
13518,2020-09-08 12:12:51,ilxboo,"Once again, the Stepien doesn’t speak for everybody. And quit with the, you’re dumber then me and you’re confused bs just because someone disagrees with you."
13519,2020-09-04 04:07:09,ilxboo,"That's fair on the roll for the most part. I think Grant will be quite good on play making out of the short roll and pick and pop. Personally though, I think of Theis' role as defined more by defense than it is offense and that's where Grant can play like Theis. I also think Grant will play his most productive minutes essentially as a 5, primarily guarding the other team's biggest player, with some match up exceptions."
13520,2020-09-08 14:46:01,ilxboo,"That's just the definition of the term, not really a perspective of theirs. You can find it elsewhere too. It's also a term that really doesn't fit Grant Williams game in the very slightest. Never said anyone was dumber than anyone else bc of their takes on individual basketball players. That would be really dumb. I still don't know how you would call Grant an offensive black hole without being confused as to who he was though."
13521,2020-09-03 12:16:18,ilqo02,Good for him. Honestly haven’t seen one of his movies or shows but my students love them. He built his own brand and I definitely respect that.

Oprah Winfrey would be proud.

Although media mogul Tyler Perry is still worth $1.5 billion less than Winfrey, he has become a billionaire, according to Forbes (https://www.forbes.com/sites/maddieberg/2020/09/01/from-poor-as-hell-to-billionaire-how-tyler-perry-changed-show-business-forever/#45ad8c5334b5)

The business magazine calculated that Perry’s library of TV series and films — including his iconic Madea character, who stars in 11 movies — is worth $320 million. Tyler Perry Studios, built on a former Confederate army base, clocks in at $280 million.

But the producer didn’t always own $300 million worth of cash and investments, a $60-million stake in BET+ and $40 million in “homes and toys.” Born into poverty in New Orleans, Perry was once homeless, living out of his car while working on his first play, “I Know I’ve Been Changed.”

“I love when people say you come from ‘humble beginnings,’” he told Forbes. “[It] means you were poor as hell.”

The set of Tyler Perry's show ""Sistas"" filming during the Covid-19 pandemic

Winfrey saw one of Perry’s early plays in Los Angeles before inviting him onto her talk show in 2001. It was there that she advised him to take control of his own empire.

“Perry has succeeded for two reasons: He has honed a product that too many others viewed as destined for the discount bin,” Forbes wrote in its September cover feature. “And he made sure to control it all.”

And Perry has a lot to control: His Atlanta studio alone comprises 330 acres; it’s where he filmed the first TV series (“Sistas”) produced entirely during the COVID-19 pandemic. It’s also where R&B singers Monica and Brandy faced off on Monday for their high-profile Verzuz battle.

“I own the lights,” Perry told Forbes. “I own the sets. So that’s where the difference is. Because I own everything, my returns are higher.”

As public discourse has begun to condemn deriving value from racial identity, some skeptics reacted critically to the news.

Perry’s content has been regularly criticized for portrayals of the “angry Black woman” trope, sexism and homophobia.

In June, the billionaire appeared on Netflix’s “BlackAF,” talking to host Kenya Barris about creating content for the Black community.

“I know that I’m telling stories that my folks want to see,” he said. “I’m talking from our point of view. We’re speaking a language; we’re speaking a shorthand that we get, that white people don’t necessarily get.”"

“In the past and present, the rub of black capitalism is evident; it measures success in a few black entrepreneurs, while the everyday black people living, working, and shopping in the segregated economies still face existential financial threats. They’re still plagued by the wealth gap, squeezed by discrimination, and targeted by predatory businesses. For these people moving their dollars from a white firm to a black one can provide cosmetic change, but rarely does it fix the fundamental underpinnings of racial inequality.”"

My main issue with Perry is his arrogance lack of improvement. I actually liked *Daddy's little girls* and *Why did I Get Married?.* But I haven't seen anything at that level come out of his production company in years. All of his more recent stuff just seems to put him and his BS fantasies front and center."

I agree with you a lot about the lack of improvement and I think that goes back to him being the writer, director and producer of most of his films.  I think his movies have been going steadily downhill with the worst one being A Fall From Grace. I also get mad that he wastes talented actors on bad movies."

I mean, yeah, she vandalized his mansion in a moment of weakness, but she ultimately saves his life, nurses him back to health, and stands by him, forgiving him despite his terrible behavior.

The fact that you took from this that she was the abuser for putting her foot down and refusing to be mistreated makes it sound like you think women should just sit there and take abuse and be the “better person”... yikes."

Well it’s almost always better for the worker to be in one than not. All institutions are comprised of human beings making them corruptible, however, at least in theory an organized labor union is traditionally the only party with the strength and leverage to actually advocate effectively for the rights and to the benefit of the worker. The costs are almost always outweighed by the benefits. In the fundamentally adversarial dynamic between Labor and Capital, I am always on the side of Labor(you know the ones who produce all of the value for a given organization, contribute daily to its profitability, and then almost never share in those profits). 
Workers of the world unite!
Capital exist not but by the grace of labor.

There is less extreme poverty than at any point in human history, at least pre-COVId lockdown there was, so that tells us the things you need to lift entire nations out of poverty are:

-free market capitalism
-free trade
-governments that respect rights and private property 
- access to energy that is reliable and cheap
- access to education

13658,2020-09-03 03:03:38,illh1z,"Critics are miserable creatures that are forced to spend all of their time doing things that one would think is pleasant, but , in reality, destroys their joy in movies.  So they see a unique film which makes them feel something different, and breaks up the monotony of their existence, and they find a tiny bit of joy, where before, there only was emptiness.  So they say two thumbs up."
13659,2020-09-03 03:25:37,illh1z,"Maybe some critics focus on the artistic value of a movie, which can sometimes be pretty different from what the audiences want: entertainment."
13660,2020-09-03 03:27:50,illh1z,"I stopped listening to critics after a couple of films I thought were just terrible were given 5* reviews and some films I found to be quite entertaining and enjoyable were given poor reviews. For that reason I avoid as much promotional material for a film as possible including reviews. I only like to read a brief description. 

Critics think they are the gatekeepers to what they feel is 'high art' when that really isnt the case at all. I think the average person from the general population likes films that are entertaining and around the 2 hr mark or shorter and there is nothing wrong with this. Such films tend to get lambasted by critics because they have more ""common"" attributes that make them easily enjoyable for the masses and to be ""common"" and easily accessible is not a desirable trait to critics.

The only way to understand their lunacy is to try and watch films with the same pretentiousness they do. Watch what you like. If you are curious give it a go and make your own judgment. Maybe you'l agree with the critics maybe you wont"
13661,2020-09-03 03:33:53,illh1z,"> The Shape of Water, Dunkirk, The Thomas Crown affair. Why is it that when a critic gives rave reviews to a film, people avoid it like the plague? 

They do? I saw two of those because I hadn't really been interested but then they got such great reviews I checked them out.

> Critics regularly savage Tyler Perry  

Have you ever tried to watch one of those things?"
13662,2020-09-03 20:18:45,illh1z,"The point of film criticism is not to tell you what to think or like.  The point is to provoke thought and discussion.  That's it.

I guarantee that no critic called you up and said, ""Don't have an opinion of your own!""

You're supposed to.  That's the whole point.  Watch the movie, regardless of what we say.

If you can't engage with the opinions of others without feeling insecure about your own, though, that's a whole other life skills matter..."
13663,2020-09-03 03:10:15,illh1z,can i quote this or is the copyright to someone else?
13664,2020-09-03 18:37:57,illh1z,yes and i like them.
13665,2020-09-03 03:11:04,illh1z,"You can quote it.  I just typed it up off the top of my head, but I do believe it is true."
13666,2020-09-03 03:27:27,ilkw4c,Has Tyler Perry ever written a great play? I'm not saying his stuff is *bad* and it certainly resonates with his audience but the rate at which he churns his writing out there's a noticeable compromise in quality. I'm more familiar with his films but they've definitely gotten worse over the years and there's a lot of criticism about the stories he chooses to tell and his treatment of female characters.
13667,2020-09-03 04:31:14,ilkw4c,"Because he is a grifter imo. He milks a very certain demographic. I ran a theatre for years, and in that time I dealt with his many of his family selling the exact same act he was doing all trying to get famous, and that's the point. They all play older characters in shows that have reprehensible morals, and it's all full of stunningly bad soap opera level talent that doesnt give a shit for the craft. Dudes jacked like bodybuilders playing janitors trying to get famous with no talent.  It's not about what good theatre is with these shows, they are simply vehicles.  Every ""producer"" who inserts themselves into a play and then writes a narrative where the protagonist isn't even the main character of the show just so that wannabe star can take their bow last after they make a final constume change into a suit  before their personal meet and greet disgusts me.  


Yes, I have pent up rage on this subject. Gospel plays are a grift. I have seen people pass the plate then run out at intermission and let the cast phone it in with no stage manager for the rest of the show, I've seen sets fall in on themselves nearly killing people because people who have no respect for theatre just want to get famous."
13668,2020-09-03 05:41:46,ilkw4c,"> Tyler Perry is by far the most successful and popular playwright of our time.

By what metrics do you assess Tyler Perry to make this absolutely absurd statement?"
13669,2020-09-03 12:05:25,ilkw4c,He’s on the Actors Equity do not work list. I’ve always wondered why.
13670,2020-09-03 04:17:55,ilkw4c,"By far? 

You’re talking like this dude is the Michael Jordan of playwrights."
13671,2020-09-03 05:52:22,ilkw4c,"Honestly, as someone who isn't American, I only found out Tyler Perry writes plays from ""A Strange Loop"".

I've always seen him as a producer (""Precious"") and the guy who did Madea. I didn't know those started out as plays. I doubt most people outside America are very familiar with his plays (or with him, actually)."
13672,2020-09-03 17:20:56,ilkw4c,"If you want to watch quality writing from an African-American about the African-American experience, look no further than August Wilson.

His plays have always been highly regarded for their stylistic dialogue with larger than life characters. The fact that he won 2 Pulitzers and is only known for 10 plays is pretty big. And his popularity is gaining resurgence nowadays because of Denzel Washington producing his entire repertoire on screen. The revival of Fences made a lot of money and broke box office records in the Cort Theatre, so people are still seeing August Wilson plays.

By what metric do you assess that Tyler Perry plays are more ""enjoyable"" and ""better executed"" than Wilson's? By your own personal experience? If so, then that is not a sufficient metric to gauge their acclaim since it's one person's opinion. 

Few plays are not meant to be ""enjoyable"" or ""laugh out loud"", and that does not take away from their quality. I enjoy watching ""The Room"", but I can still recognize its shortcomings and its lack of quality compared to a more subdued film like ""The Godfather""."
13673,2020-09-03 13:36:14,ilkw4c,Bc he's most known for Medea. Not the Greek play.
13674,2020-09-03 15:40:25,ilkw4c,I genuinely had no idea that he was a playwright. Can’t respect someone for what I don’t know they do.
13675,2020-09-03 05:23:06,ilkw4c,TYLER PERRY WRITES REAL LIIIIIIIIIFE!!!!!
13676,2020-09-03 12:04:56,ilkw4c,Other people make good points but also miss a simple one: racism
13677,2020-09-03 03:37:55,ilkw4c,Eaxctly.
13678,2020-09-03 03:56:37,ilkw4c,"He writes morality plays.
Those aren't terrible because they are well meaning."
13679,2020-09-03 10:39:26,ilkw4c,"I’d compare his plays to popular musicals, which seem just as broad and ridiculous, compromised and problematic (certainly the older ones), yet retain a respect and love by many in the theater. Why doesn’t he get more acclaim given our current focus on inclusivity in theater?"
13680,2020-09-03 06:33:13,ilkw4c,OP is secretly Tyler Perry. How very Kanye of you OP.
13681,2020-09-03 06:21:22,ilkw4c,It seems like the metric is money earned and name recognition among the general public. They’re certainly not going off of quality or critical acclaim.
13682,2020-09-03 13:24:18,ilkw4c,"He refused to sign an AEA contract while working with AEA actors back in 2015, and has continued to do so in other productions."
13683,2020-09-03 10:00:54,ilkw4c,He's more like the Michael Bay of playwrights.
13684,2020-09-03 10:42:02,ilkw4c,"Tbh, I’m American and I didn’t know he was a playwright originally, I only know about his movies from people talking about them."
13685,2020-09-03 18:52:53,ilkw4c,"Wilson is way way way better than Perry. More enjoyable; better executed. He’s brilliant. Maybe I wasn’t clear. I was comparing Perry to Michael R Jackson’s Strange Loop. 

I wonder why Perry doesn’t get the same regard as like Clueless the musical or that one about the fairy tales or whatever broad-humoured Broadway stuff."
13686,2020-09-03 17:05:30,ilkw4c,"The Greek *Medea* by Euripides is way better, too."
13687,2020-09-04 12:20:45,ilkw4c,Race traitor? Oh no!
13688,2020-09-03 04:11:46,ilkw4c,"I don't know that that's true though, even if they're well meaning a lot of people seem to take issue with the messaging in his plays and how he depicts women/black culture."
13689,2020-09-03 10:47:45,ilkw4c,"That’s the problem, why doesn’t he get the same critical acclaim as a shitty broadway musical? What do we mean by “quality”. I love serious theatre: Shakespeare, O’Neill, Wilson. I enjoy the best modern plays: Baker, McPherson, Rajiv Joseph. But I enjoyed the Madea show I saw, and the crowd fucking loved it. I only saw clips of Strange Loop, for example, but Perry’s work seemed funnier, better executed, and more generally accessible. Yet the gap in “critical acclaim” and judgement of “quality” is astounding.

It stinks of snobbishness... and worse."
13690,2020-09-03 16:38:16,ilkw4c,"Thank you! Well that’s shitty of him to do as a playwright, and I assume director/producer."
13691,2020-09-03 10:49:20,ilkw4c,Bad Boys = Madea
13692,2020-09-03 04:36:49,ilkw4c,Thats the weird part
13693,2020-09-03 17:26:07,ilkw4c,"If by ""worse"", you mean racism, then why are August Wilson plays more critically acclaimed than Perry's? Maybe it really is a quality issue.

The fact that an African-American writer chose to devote most of his musical to attacking the quality of Perry's work by having his lead character not wanting to ""sell out"" by ghostwriting a Tyler Perry play speaks volumes about how people's opinions of him transcends racial issues."
13694,2020-09-03 15:52:35,ilkw4c,"Because his work just isn’t that good. What shitty musicals are you speaking of?

Rodgers and Hammerstein’s work? Sondheim’s? Andrew Lloyd Webber? Schwartz?

They’re icons and revolutionized theatre. It appears you’re attempting to create a problem that just simply doesn’t exist."
13695,2020-09-03 11:39:38,ilkw4c,"I mean then, if you draw that comparison its obvious why he doesn't get that respect. Michael Bay movies make a tonne of money, and that's not open for the debate. Tbh, he's probably one of only three hollywood directors who can get away with basically doing exactly what they want (Bay, Spielberg, Nolan). But Bay's films, whilst at times entertaining (I can certainly enjoy the Rock, the first Transformers movie etc), lack really any artistic depth etc. His legacy will not be one of the finest filmmakers of his generation, like the other two will. It's the same with Perry, from what little i've seen. They have their entertaining moments but they're not great. also, surely a lot of that money comes from his TV/Film work, not the stage. Is Aaron Sorkin one of the most successful playwrights of all time because he wrote a couple of good plays, one got turned into a film and then he transitioned and had most of his money/success in film? I think not"

13724,2020-09-03 03:56:43,ilhn8q,He had a small role in gone girl but killed every second he was on screen. Wish he would branch off in that type of role every now and then. But his madea movies are sometimes a guilty pleasure watch

Not a big fan of his work personally but he seems like a great guy and I commend him for what hes accomplished."
13729,2020-09-03 13:11:24,ilhn8q,"It's always weird when I read about him, his movies or their success because he's an unknown entity here in the UK really. The Madea movies have almost no presence and most people wouldn't recognise his name at all.

It's impressive to build such an isolated movie empire in the States nowadays, especially when his work seems to be met with derision by many."

Tyler Perry seems along the same lines - he does things on his terms and not only is it working out for him financially but he's probably having a much better overall enjoyment of his career because of it.
13779,2020-09-03 16:58:08,ilhn8q,As far as class and wealth goes yes but less privileged than his white peers

He is insanely rich, provides for his friends and crew while churning out movies for his niche audience."

13821,2020-09-03 14:54:44,ilhn8q,"Everyone faces a lack of privilege in any given field.  It depends on the person and a undetermined amount of factors.   He has wealth privilege and influence (some could call that power) and lives a much better life than 99% of the population.  I’d say that trumps a white kid who is growing up in the middle class.  My point is, Skin color has nothing to do with privilege.     His rise to fame and wealth is a perfect example of that.  Hell you could even say his skin color got him to where he is."

The stuff he does with Happy Madison is so dumb, but that's exactly what it's meant to be.  He made his money and has had a few great performances.  At this point he's just making goofy stuff to have fun with his friends and keep paychecks coming for his crew.  

He's doing exactly what he wants to do with his buddies and is finding a way to be successful in his own way for it, and in a way that's living the dream."

13854,2020-09-03 15:05:14,ilhn8q,"You are right about the first part of your comment, and it is pretty much just a restatement of my comment. But skin color absolutely does influence how you are treated in the United States. Even famous black people are mistreated in the US due to their skin color. Henry Louis Gates was arrested on his own doorstep for breaking into his own house. The arresting officer didn't know who he was, only what he could see. Tyler Perry is an exception, not the rule. If what you say, ""Hell, you could even say that his skin color got him to where he is,"" then you would see far more black billionaires. Would you like to guess at the share of billionaires in the US who are black, compared to those who are white?"

”No billionaires = everyone’s lives better” is the most childish and asinine line of thinking. It’s hella entertaining to see woke teens on the internet spout it off though."

A homeless black man worked hard and overcame adversity of all kinds some race related some not and became a billionaire he turned his strength and gift into billions.  I don’t think color is a factor.  Every person has their own adversity, tragedies, life experiences that either drive us to succeed or drive us to fail and become a “victim”.

13910,2020-09-03 14:57:59,ilhn8q,"What do you mean ""own"" - Jeff Bezos doesn't have that money sitting in a bank account. Its his networth in Amazon stock. Amazon doesn't pay stock dividends, so he doesn't get to touch that money unless he sells. In his last sell off he paid 400 million in taxes.   


So what do you want to do to get your hands on his networth? Make him sell all the stock? But who can buy that much stock? If no one can, Amazon has to liquidate to pay him. That puts Amazon, and all their workers out of business. Is that somehow better for the communities that Amazon is in?   


Wealth is created, there isn't some finite amount that is passed around or taken from other people. Jeff Bezos *created* that wealth based on the evaluation of Amazon. That's just one example, and I could provide countless more. Get off reddit and read a damn book."

13914,2020-09-03 16:28:00,ilhn8q,"They earned some but not all of it.

A slaver ""earns"" money by running a successful business. However we can all agree they don't actually earn their money, because they don't pay their workers, and are basically stealing the money from them.

Similarly, exploiting a system and laws for maximum personal profit, while purposefully underpaying and undervaluing workers means that you haven't earned all your money. Sure some of it, but Jeff doesn't just happen to work 200billion times harder than a worker, or is 200billion times smarter in business. In some extent his wealth is disproportionate to the amount of work, and this can only be at the expense of the workers"
13915,2020-09-03 15:04:49,ilhn8q,"This is missing the point, sure he doesn't have that money in a big briefcase, but he has access to that wealth.

Either way it's not an argument that answers the question. Say we're off by a factor of 5, or 10, or 200 even! We're so wrong that Jeff Bezos has 200x LESS money than actual listed. He still has one. Billion. Dollars. This is still more money than any one person could hope to spend in a lifetime, and there are still people in abject poverty wondering how they'll afford their next meal.

Also the ""read a book"" argument isn't the best when there's countless books that agree with me. Jeff did not create 100% of his wealth. He created some of it sure, but his(underpaid) workers created most of the wealth, Jeff isn't the only employee of Amazon. You could argue a slaver with a billion dollar ""created"" or ""earned"" their wealth because it's theirs. But we all agree they didn't create it, their slaves did, and they stole it by not paying the slaves. Having £200b in personal wealth while you have workers at food banks and soup kitchens isn't slavery sure, but you've definitely not earned every single penny"

why? like, in the abstract, why?"
13918,2020-09-03 18:11:00,ilhn8q,"Okay, you got me there."
13919,2020-09-03 17:47:05,ilhn8q,"They aren't stealing any money from their workers. They're not slaves, forced to work for Amazon. They sign a mutual contract that both parties are at any time free to terminate. So I'm not agreeing with your premise here."
13920,2020-09-03 15:47:15,ilhn8q,"Underpaid according to who, and compared to what? Warehouse jobs in these communities pay more than fast food, and above minimum wage. 

\>  You could argue a slaver with a billion dollar ""created"" or ""earned"" their wealth because it's theirs.  

This argument doesn't hold up. In this scenario, you press people into labor and don't pay them for their service. Employment in the US is **at will** \- meaning you agree to do the work for the price listed. No one forces these people to work for Amazon. Further still, these jobs wouldn't exist if Bezos didn't *create* Amazon. 

This belief that there is inherent value in labor doesn't make sense. If I spend all day making pies out of mud, and no one wants to buy them, my labor was worthless. 

I don't disagree with you that corporations maximize profits over people, or that there aren't shady employment laws and tax avoidance, but I think you're focused on the wrong outcome here, and drawing your conclusions in retrospect. 

The core issue facing the US is out and out corporatism in our government. Our elected officials, on both sides, are in bed with corporations and create laws *that allow them to do this*. Don't blame Bezos for playing the game that's on the board.

And besides, I'll never become a billionaire - and that's not the point. I've been able to purchase Amazon stock and raise my own net worth, due to something someone else created. That provides value to me. Go on Jeff!"
13921,2020-09-03 17:42:50,ilhn8q,"Look, I just don't prescribe blame to faceless corporations or individuals and lump them under an umbrella. I'm not getting fucked by the rich. They've taken nothing from me that doesn't belong to me.   

And you get billionaires that do philanthropic work that eclipses whatever good most people will do in their lifetime. So I'm not going to paint all of them with the same brush just because they have a lot of money.

There's people in this thread advocating for a money cap! I don't know what political system allows for this but it's not one I want anything to do with."
13922,2020-09-03 16:31:39,ilhn8q,"Side note: I feel like we disagree on a lot, but thanks for a civil discussion without any anger. Rare to see on Reddit lol.

My last points are: ""underpaid according to who?"" - underpaid according to basic human needs, and what is defined as poverty. If his workers are on food stamps (thousands are) then they can't afford food clearly, so they are underpaid as I'd argue any job should provide enough payment for a person to feed themselves.

And if your choice is have a job or starve it's not much of a choice. Sure you can work somewhere else, but maybe they aren't hiring, maybe you can't afford to quit, maybe the other jobs are also underpaid and run by billionaires. There will always be situations where workers don't have the luxury to just quit, so the support for basic human needs has to be provided to all. And one single person having £200b by definition deprives others of money they need to live"
13923,2020-09-03 17:59:01,ilhn8q,"You are getting fucked by the rich, maybe not now, but when it hits you, you'll know! Or just keep denying it. I don't believe in a money cap, but a person with 100+ billion does not need 100+ billion, or even 10, or even 1. You shouldn't want to live in a world where people can be helped but aren't because ""that's their money"". Truth is their quality of life doesn't change at all if they don't have access to a couple billion, and in the end that's all people want, quality of life. This isn't really a problem in my country, but USA is depressingly greedy."
13924,2020-09-03 16:50:37,ilhn8q,"I understand the angle you're driving at, but I think it's a flawed premise. The market sets the rates. If someone is offering the same service as you, but for a cheaper price, then people will buy the other service. The same works in terms of wages. People end up at Amazon warehouse jobs because it's the most competitive for where they are.

A different point, too, is that the employer assumes all the risk. There is no burden or liability on a worker if the company is sued, or if the company mismanages their money and can't pay their debts. The same is not true for the people who own or run the company. Now, we could certainly debate (and would probably agree) that there are far too many loop holes, and people not being held accountable at the top, but that goes back to my last comment in my previous post about corporatism.   


Ultimately I do not see the burden of a safety net as a responsibility of an employer. I feel that's an obligation of the government to provide through taxes. If the government cannot adequately provide those services, punishing the private sector doesn't fix that problem. It is government mismanagement and waste that let's down the worker and fails to subsidize what wages cannot cover."
13925,2020-09-03 18:10:21,ilhn8q,"But you're still dictating what other people should be doing with their money. I'm sorry but I just don't believe in that. The taxation system isn't perfect but it's the best way we have of making sure their money is funneled back into the system.

And I really don't like taking the higher ground over anyone, even billionaires. Would I be that generous if I had that kind of money? I hope so, but I can't say, so I'm not going to judge them.

I just think this is a more nuanced issue than billionaires bad."
13926,2020-09-03 18:28:29,ilhn8q,"There is still a risk on the worker though. If my company mismanaged debt or gets sued, they'll likely lay off employees or go bust leaving me without a job. Sure am exec might get fired too, but it's easy to wait for a new job when you have millions saved than when you're on minimum wage the whole time"
13927,2020-09-03 18:16:29,ilhn8q,"Do you honestly think billionaires and multi-billion dollar companies are getting taxed? I have bad news for you. Their money is being hoarded, not taxed, and not funneled back into the economy. That's kind of one of the huge issues people have with billionaires and companies."
13928,2020-09-03 21:21:09,ilhn8q,"There are oceans between these two types of risk, though. Founders like Bezos are beholden to the government (SEC), creditors like banks, and shareholders. Their failure could take their networth, ability to trade in the market, and bar them from employment in general. None of that risk exists for an individual contributor. 

Don’t get me wrong, no one should be a paycheck away from homelessness. I just struggle to see how an employer should be held responsible for the social safety net the government should provide. 

The truth is that not all people are equal. I don’t mean that in terms of race or gender, I mean it in terms of cognitive ability, and ability to work in general. We can’t artificially introduce equality into these systems, because hierarchies like this exist in the natural world. Not everyone could be Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk, even if they were given a million dollar head start."
13929,2020-09-03 18:28:44,ilhn8q,"You know what, you're right, I'm probably being very naive. Think I understand why you used the word ""hoard"" now."

14029,2020-10-05 19:05:20,j5ovvp,I’m so excited for this draft tomorrow
14030,2020-10-05 19:09:40,j5ovvp,"Nice work. I’d be very happy to get Reichel at 32. Also, the ducks could have a very short turn around back to contention."
14031,2020-10-05 20:09:42,j5ovvp,"I wouldn't hate the pick, but why so confident on Sanderson? 

I think we are going Euro. Raymond / Askarov / Holtz"
14032,2020-10-05 19:03:18,j5ovvp,"Definetly don’t hate the Sanderson pick, even though it wouldn’t be my choice. There’s about 8 guys I’d be happy with at four. The insane depth of the draft def takes the sting out of the insanity of picking fourth after a historically bad year."
14033,2020-10-05 19:48:18,j5ovvp,"I think ya might have given us 1 to many second round picks. We have 3, not 4 this year unless I misread when that NY pick is. 

Outside of that I'd like this haul. Only change would be snagging a goalie with one of those middle second/early third picks. One of Comesso, Daws, or Blomquist should be there and we need a goalie prospect"
14034,2020-10-05 21:47:48,j5ovvp,I see you've joined the Reichel at 32 party as well. Nice job.
14035,2020-10-07 00:49:45,j5ovvp,How will you be eating your crow?
14036,2020-10-05 20:04:03,j5ovvp,"Hopefully Yzerman can trade back if he wants Sanderson. We should be able to trade back to at least 7 (maybe 8) and pick up a mid-later round pick or two and still get him. 

Saw you mention Askarov as well in the comment section. He’s another guy that we could trade back and still get. Just straight up taking him at 4 would be a blown opportunity to pick up a couple more assets. 

We are in a very favorable position picking 4th. There is no way that there are not teams that would want to move up. And there is no way that any teams, scouts, etc. have Askarov going top 5. 

Same with Sanderson. I don’t think many teams are so desperate for a LHD that they would be willing to take him in the top 6 and pass on the forwards mentioned.

Trade back if either of these guys are Yzermans pick. 

You said you would eat crow if Yzerman doesn’t pick Sanderson at 4. You might be eating crow because nobody has a clue what Yzerman will do and even though we are in desperate need for a LHD, next years top 10 should have plenty of better ones to choose from. 

It’s a crap shoot but if we take Sanderson at 4, I cannot say I wouldn’t be disappointed. Would be a lot happier if we traded back 3-4 spots and picked him up then."

14044,2020-10-05 20:30:05,j5ovvp,My confidence is fragile. He’s just the player I’ve touted for longest and feel most comfortable with at 4. Raymond has been strongly in consideration for me though.
14045,2020-10-05 19:22:05,j5ovvp,As of right this second I’m probably Sanderson > Raymond > Askarov in order of preference at 4.
14046,2020-10-05 20:02:19,j5ovvp,Thank you so so so so so much for pointing that out. I'm with you on the goalie front. I was kind of expecting the 4th round to be a sweet spot for snagging one.
14047,2020-10-05 21:57:13,j5ovvp,Who’s not a sucker for a good story line?
14048,2020-10-07 01:41:32,j5ovvp,Well done. :D
14049,2020-10-05 20:30:53,j5ovvp,"Really sounds like Ottawa likes him at 5. If Yzerman wants Sanderson, it may look a lot like 2019 where a trade down wasn’t feasible due to the teams behind us."
14050,2020-10-05 20:28:28,j5ovvp,"If we can trade back and still get Sanderson. That would be magical. I’d still take him at 4 over Raymond/Perfetti. 

I’ll eat crow simply because I’ve beat his drum for the longest. His size, skating, defensive prowess, physical play, NHL blood lines, underrated offense, going to a strong college program. There’s nothing not to like about him."
14051,2020-10-05 19:32:14,j5ovvp,"I really like his size. The fact that he’s going to BC means he’s playing meaningful hockey while getting adequate time to fill out his frame.

But yeah Goalie very well could be an option at the top of the third."

14056,2020-10-05 19:38:44,j5ovvp,"If we were 8 I would die for an Askarov pick, but at 4 I just don't see it. Any particular reason besides our obvious goalie deficiency? Either way, good write up bud, appreciate it."
14057,2020-10-05 20:23:32,j5ovvp,Haha no worries! We could wait till the 4th as well as I imagine a couple will still be there. I'd just hate to risk being at our late 4th and having to go to the 3rd/4th tier of goalie prospects
14058,2020-10-05 20:58:09,j5ovvp,"So that brings into question who Yzerman wants. If Yzerman really wants him and he is the guy without a doubt, then yea, he will take him at 4. 

But if Yzerman isn't really dead set on any one player at 4 (or if its close), trade back to 7 and see who is there. Pick up 1-2 more picks and take Sanderson at 7. Or if Sanderson is gone, it means a quality forward dropped and we can pick from who is available. If Sanderson and Drysdale are both picked in the top 6, it would mean Raymond or Rossi are still available in addition to Perfetti and Holtz. Take one of them and prioritize a LHD next year. 

Really not much risk in trading back. We either take a LHD this year or next. We have holes to fill all over. So if it doesnt happen this year, fill the hole with a forward need this year instead. Its a good draft to do it in. 

Last note: it sounds like Ottawa likes alot of guys at 5, not just Sanderson. I've heard Raymond, Rossi, Drysdale and Quinn in there as well. Its a crap shoot. So it all depends on how much Yzerman wants him. 

Needless to say, we are in control. Thats all that matters. If we are dead set on one guy, we take him at 4. If we are not, we can trade back to someone who is dead set on one guy. Personally, I cant lie that I wouldnt be a bit disappointed taking Sanderson at 4 in such a quality forward top 10 class, knowing that the forward top 10 next year is not really considered to be exceptional while the defensemen class is supposed to be. Who knows, maybe Yzerman wants to take a top 10 LHD in both of the drafts. Cant say that we dont need it."
14059,2020-10-05 23:37:02,j5ovvp,"If Ottawa reaaaaaally wants him, they should take him at 3. /s"
14060,2020-10-05 20:41:28,j5ovvp,"I wont disagree with you about him. I dont know much about the guy other than what I have read online. I can say that he definitely would fill a big need for us moreso than Drysdale would. We dont need another top 4 RHD. And maybe Sanderson turns out to be the better defensemen anyways. 

&#x200B;

But based off of everything that I have read, Sanderson probably wont go in the top 6 if we dont take him at 4. And if Yzerman took the risk and traded back to 7, and he was for some reason gone by 7, that would mean that one of the top forwards would still be on the board. Its not a bad situation either way, to pick up a couple more picks in this draft. 

For example:

Laf, Byfield, Stutzle, Raymond, Drysdale, Rossi, Sanderson (Red Wings pick) 

Or

Laf, Byfield, Stutzle, Drysdale, Raymond/ Rossi, Sanderson, Raymond/ Rossi/ Perfetti/ Holtz (Red wings pick). 

If Sanderson is still on the board at 7, we can take him. If he is not, it means that someone else dropped that we can take and then we can prioritize a LHD next year.

&#x200B;

So the question becomes, is Sanderson such a good player that he should be the unanimous pick this year for us? Or can we risk not getting him to pick up a few more assets, and if he is there, awesome. If he is not there, then we still walk away with a damn good forward prospect and more picks. In my eyes, 4-8 in the draft this year is such a crap shoot that I think it would be worth the risk, especially if Yzerman is not dead set on one guy"
14061,2020-10-05 19:34:30,j5ovvp,It gets better and better as their chemistry builds.
14062,2020-10-05 19:50:51,j5ovvp,"Ryan Hannah said so. 😂

He’s long been touted to be a franchise goaltender. His play in the Hlinka won Russia Gold over a stacked Canada team. 6-4, size is on his side, with a combination of super quick reflexes. 

But- I don’t know dick about projecting goalies. Outside of, if we can get the best one. I’m down."
14063,2020-10-05 21:46:31,j5ovvp,"Example; Seider last year was ranked I think 12-16 pretty unanimously. We took Seider, the physical, strong, two way d man. Ahead of Turcotte, Zegras, Caufield. Etc. 

Sanderson is more in the top 5 conversation today than Seider was this time last year.

One important Yzerman quote is something alone the lines of ‘you can want to make a move all you want, but you need to have a partner’."
14064,2020-10-05 20:31:31,j5ovvp,"Good enough for me. Apart from them being superstitious as hell, I don't know the first thing either. It's the long shot pick I can probably live with."
14065,2020-10-05 21:57:17,j5ovvp,"Yep, that definitely plays into this as well. But with this years top 10 draft class, and the pick being 4OA instead of 6OA, I would be surprised if a team wasnt wanting to trade up and was satisfied with the 7OA or 8OA pick. 

The question is: what is a team picking 8OA or 7OA willing to give up to move up to 4? Would it even be worth our while? What other picks can we get for it? 

I would be very surprised if Yzerman couldnt find a trade partner (if he is looking for one). That one of 6th, 7th or 8th doesnt have their eyes fixated on one particular player that might not be there by the time it gets to them. But it still comes down to what are they willing to give up. Obviously a 7th round pick wouldnt be worth our while. But a couple of mid round picks?"

14173,2020-09-30 19:17:21,j2sooh,Also I understand AD being traded had a huge effect on the draft but we'll have to work around that
14174,2020-09-30 19:20:24,j2sooh,Would the Grizz trade Conley knowing they wouldn't get their future PG?
14175,2020-09-30 19:30:21,j2sooh,I wonder if Cleveland would’ve taken Coby White. Atlanta probably still takes Hunter. So I feel we may have taken Reddish
14176,2020-09-30 19:54:14,j2sooh,"Don't Knicks take Garland - it would mean conceding that neither Frank N nor DSJ was the answer, and I don't think they were ready to do that last offseason.  At the very least it would've impeded somebody's development last season.  

In hindsight, sure, makes sense.  But not at the time.

Probably just go Hunter or Culver."
14177,2020-09-30 20:22:54,j2sooh,Then Zion + KAT in 2021.. damn

14183,2020-09-30 20:58:25,j2sooh,If the Pelicans are taking Ja at 1 maybe they don't value Lonzo so highly and consider trading AD somewhere else or getting another team involved to take Lonzo
14184,2020-09-30 19:21:40,j2sooh,I doubt it. They loved Conley and I would assume they think they'd need the spacing Conley brings to help RJ as well as his leadership to take pressure off of him
14185,2020-09-30 19:34:58,j2sooh,Honestly I don’t think they would
14186,2020-09-30 19:56:11,j2sooh,I already explained in the post that Steve Mills was about to trade down in the draft because he wanted Garland but Scott Perry convinced him to take RJ. With RJ off the board Garland is the pick
14187,2020-09-30 21:31:53,j2sooh,They said that?
14188,2020-09-30 19:39:48,j2sooh,"Should have just kept the 4th pick, still don’t think trading down was the right move"
14189,2020-09-30 19:42:49,j2sooh,"I think Reddish would’ve been the better pick personally & he showed a lot towards the end of the season, but I guess Hayes fit the whole run and gun style I imagine Griffin is trying to implement. 

Even if they didn’t trade the pick, Hunter would’ve been a day one contributor for them. Head scratcher"
14190,2020-09-30 21:42:28,j2sooh,"I’d assume if Zion stayed they both would to run it back, maybe not Reddish but I think Zion & Rj would because they seem to be pretty close friends"
14191,2020-09-30 19:52:14,j2sooh,"Exactly it’s weird, they came into the draft knowing they were going to try and compete for a playoff spot beforehand. They kept Jrue, signed JJ & Favors in FA, then signed a vet shooter from Europe. But you’re gunna take a project player at 8 instead of the nba ready NCAA champ?"
14192,2020-09-29 15:35:11,j20gcn,Some of those (eg Ariana Grande/Selena Gomez) would never do it. I imagine it’d be closer to a Dancing with the stars cast with people who are slightly less famous but still well known in various circles

Far more than the numbers is just how they look on any given night. They look like the best team in the NHL almost every single time I watch them play. Other teams have cracks and bad stretches, the Lightning seem to have the odd bad game but never a streak of them.

14213,2020-09-29 14:36:11,j1zqm1,"It was curious to me that the stars came out in game 5 shot out of a rocket and really took it to tampa through regulation. Tampa came on strong in ot but dallas got the win.


I guess they emptied the tank for that win, because they looked so slow through the first 50 minutes. Nbc kept commenting about them letting vasy handle the puck but a function of that was the stars in previous games would follow the puck into the zone and immediately converge to try and harass vasy. This game they just didn't have the legs."
14214,2020-09-29 15:36:29,j1zqm1,"I’m really curious to hear detail on injuries especially the stars, they were doing ok on health until like the end of vegas series it seemed. They look beat yesterday they looked very tired"
14215,2020-09-29 16:16:29,j1zqm1,When will the pain stop
14216,2020-09-29 15:30:01,j1zqm1,"I slept in so hard this morning and its not from drinking, I think it was being overwhelmed seeing this group win the cup. Unreal. 

I was too young to care when they won in 04, but this hits me right in the core."
14217,2020-09-29 15:49:46,j1zqm1,"Does anyone have a shot of the Cup celebrations with the people partying in Tampa on the Tv's in the background of the arena? Couldn't find any on Getty. Maybe there's a screenshot somewhere?

Of all the things last night, I just can't get over that moment. A true bubble success, the deserving win for Tampa, accompanied with images of thousands of people partying in Florida, seemingly ignoring the pandemic. Just a surreal visual moment after all everyone has been through."
14218,2020-09-29 15:28:51,j1zqm1,"I have to take back all the negative things I've said about Cooper in the past couple of years. The man proved my cynicism was unfounded, and that he could adjust the game plan once he had some new, hard-fighting depth pieces in Coleman, Goodrow, and Maroon.

Congratulations, Cooper. You made me and many others look foolish for doubting you."
14219,2020-09-29 17:33:37,j1zqm1,I've never been more depressed in my life.. I could've handled losing but not with the way they played.. They didn't show up until 10min left
14220,2020-09-29 14:10:49,j1zqm1,"Gutted for the stars, but they just couldn’t keep up."
14221,2020-09-29 21:56:59,j1zqm1,"Am I glad Tampa Bay won? No. 

Do I think they earned it? Of course.

Is this my first season of actually following hockey? Yes

Is Tampa Bay my least favorite team in the NHL for beating the Stars last night? Absolutely 

See y’all next year in the finals"
14222,2020-09-29 14:02:44,j1zqm1,***LET'S GOOOOOOOO***
14223,2020-09-29 22:45:21,j1zqm1,Why the fuck hasn’t the handshake line been posted yet?
14224,2020-09-30 05:19:58,j1zqm1,"Serious question: Why was the McDonough tripping in the 3rd a penalty? You see guys lay down to block shots all the time, how was this different?"
14225,2020-09-29 14:27:07,j1zqm1,What if a captain skips the handshake line though?
14226,2020-09-29 16:28:40,j1zqm1,Making money always helps the sting of a loss a bit more. As someone who continually bets against the Jets (football) I can confirm
14227,2020-09-29 14:35:27,j1zqm1,"Weirdly enough, the closest recent comparison I can think of is LA in 2012. They took a 3-0 lead in all four series, and only lost 4 games all playoffs. They didn’t come into the playoffs as a contender but very quickly (hah) it felt like anything other than a win was inevitable."
14228,2020-09-29 14:45:55,j1zqm1,"If they can get sergy and Cirelli back on board, there's no reason they can't bring it back. 

Really it's the blue line that needs the most revision. I think only Hedman and Mcdonagh are the only sure things. It's assumed foote will probably make his debut for us and beyond that? Just a matter of resigning everyone we can."
14229,2020-09-29 14:07:53,j1zqm1,"They just looked completely gassed. Credit to Tampa for shutting things down, but it felt like injuries and time finally caught up to us. We didn't even really make our first push until about 10 minutes left in the game, not sure why we didn't pull our goalie during the PP but oh well."
14230,2020-09-29 14:22:27,j1zqm1,"I was stunned when they kept passing it around near the point looking for the perfect shot with less than two minutes remaining. They really struggled to generate anything at all. And it took them too long to get Dobby off for an extra skater. 

A great run for Dallas, no one expected them to be there especially with their backup goaltender, but their effort last night wasn't good."
14231,2020-09-29 14:05:57,j1zqm1,"I dunno, seemed to work pretty well against us..."
14232,2020-09-29 15:10:36,j1zqm1,Vasy played every game and didn't get pulled once. I feel slightly bad for McElhinny but am amazed at Vasy's fortitude to play every minute of every game.
14233,2020-09-29 17:51:21,j1zqm1,"I forget which game, but Doc jinxed him one game and he did again last night. I was gonna be pissed if Dallas got a garbage goal at the end there."
14234,2020-09-29 19:50:41,j1zqm1,Never
14235,2020-09-29 16:13:26,j1zqm1,What I really like about you guys is how you bounced back from last year’s Playoff Disaster. Congratulations
14236,2020-09-29 18:08:18,j1zqm1,"I was 19 when we won in '04 and this one feels a lot nicer. In '04, we were still kind-of a cinderella that was expected to go deep, but maybe not win a cup. 

This time, after 5 years of almosts and heartbreak, it's so much sweeter."
14237,2020-09-29 21:36:33,j1zqm1,"It still hasn’t sunk in that I just watched them all hold the cup above their heads. Like even when I rewatch the video, I still can’t believe it’s real."
14238,2020-09-29 18:09:15,j1zqm1,"It was great, but people seemingly ignoring the pandemic has been fairly standard for Florida..."
14239,2020-09-29 15:31:32,j1zqm1,I think Coopers just gotten extremely unlucky in what runs we have had. So many key injuries any chance they've had.
14240,2020-09-29 17:45:06,j1zqm1,This was me in 2015. It will suck for a while but it gets better with time. Hopefully you will have a chance to heal soon and not have to wait 5 years for it to happen.
14241,2020-09-29 17:46:09,j1zqm1,"They gave everything they had. Injuries (and TB) were too much to overcome. Hopefully this pushes Benn and Seguin and everyone else more than ever next year, coming this close"
14242,2020-09-29 15:01:07,j1zqm1,"Eh, of all the things that still bring up some residual salt about 2009, Crosby isn’t one anymore."
14243,2020-09-29 18:46:54,j1zqm1,I always felt like that was blown out of proportion. He kept having teammate after teammate come up to him and just never made it to the line. I think he honestly just got distracted and forgot.
14244,2020-09-29 21:32:17,j1zqm1,"I was gonna type this too. The 2012 Kings flat out dominated the west and then, while a little shaky in the finals, finished it up in six. Our record wasn’t as great as there’s, but it’s still a close comparison."
14245,2020-09-29 15:08:52,j1zqm1,"Of that D group, I think Serge is the most important to our future success."
14246,2020-09-29 15:10:18,j1zqm1,"Tbh I can see Brisebois making some surprising trades this offseason to fetch the highest value for players (Killorn anyone?). As much as I’d like to keep playing with the exact same roster, we are eternally cap strapped and our blue line is old as fuck. We will never have to worry about not being contenders as long as we have Kuch/Hedman/Stamkos/Vasy (and Point for 2 more years). Might as well rejig a bit and get some more youngin’s in.

All I want is Tyler Johnson gone. Preferably before waiting for the expansion draft."
14247,2020-09-29 17:49:53,j1zqm1,Maybe JBB and Yzerman can make a deal so DET takes Johnson+ so we can keep Cirelli and Sergachev.
14248,2020-09-29 14:20:11,j1zqm1,But they couldn't get a good zone entry or hold in the offensive zone
14249,2020-09-29 15:00:46,j1zqm1,"I agree. It looks like what happened to us in conference finals. People call it a choke, but when one team is rolling and you are beat up, it’s hard to overcome. Bolts were all over you guys last night, and besides getting new fresh players, there wasn’t much to do to fix it."
14250,2020-09-29 16:03:08,j1zqm1,"Injuries screwed us in 2015 so I feel your pain. I think the entire Lightning Organization relaized after that, that you need crazy depth for sustained/deep playoff runs. 

Injuries will always happen and at the worst times. Still got to find a way to win. Great series though and wouldn't surprise me if Dallas has another great run next year. Just please get rid of Perry."
14251,2020-09-29 14:26:02,j1zqm1,Hahaha. Self burn. Those are rare
14252,2020-09-29 15:30:46,j1zqm1,"""Fuck it I'll do it myself"""
14253,2020-09-29 15:43:02,j1zqm1,"Does anyone know if McElhinny gets his name on the cup? He didn't play half the regular season games, and didn't play during the playoffs, but I feel like he should be on it."
14254,2020-09-29 15:47:28,j1zqm1,[deleted]
14255,2020-09-29 17:47:28,j1zqm1,I really hope so. Everyone said the healthiest team would win this Cup and they were right
14256,2020-09-29 15:40:39,j1zqm1,"He was a gracious loser in 2008, don't forget."
14257,2020-09-29 15:40:04,j1zqm1,"He's the youngest and is still developing, so I agree. He and Cirelli are the most important signings. 

Cernak has been useful and affordable so it will depend on if he takes a lesser deal. Then it's just filling in the bottom pair with foote."
14258,2020-09-29 17:29:00,j1zqm1,I don't think Killorn moving will surprise anyone.  He's the easiest to move and he looked decent in the Finals.  I also figure they'll be able to move Coburn or send him down.  Johnson probably is staying this season.
14259,2020-09-29 14:41:04,j1zqm1,"Lightning really, really shut you guys down last night, especially on that late powerplay. I was telling my other half that you guys needed to pull Dobby as soon as it started, but y'all just never got a chance to setup to make it possible."
14260,2020-09-29 15:59:15,j1zqm1,"Yes, all a goalie has to do is dress for it to count as a game played in the Finals"
14261,2020-09-29 16:00:56,j1zqm1,I would be shocked if the team didn't put his name on the Cup. He's been a part of the team this entire year and is signed for next year as well. He played well when we needed to and was for all intents and purposes the prototypical backup.
14262,2020-09-29 15:55:24,j1zqm1,"You were sitting at 0 right now, so I wouldn't classify that as ""many""

But no I wasn't the one person to downvote you."
14263,2020-09-29 17:48:40,j1zqm1,"Yeah Benn and Seguin get more hate than they deserve. They looked gutted in those interviews last night. I am excited for next year, love this team"
14264,2020-09-29 22:39:14,j1zqm1,"I'm really curious about injuries for both teams. We were fortunate that there was only really one guy out for us in Stamkos, but the injury list post playoffs is always fascinating."
14265,2020-09-29 16:08:35,j1zqm1,"Alright good, he definitely deserves it."
14266,2020-09-29 16:00:39,j1zqm1,"Yeah, I suppose I was overreacting, as I often do when I post something I feel is completely uncontroversial and get a couple of early downvoters. Sorry. And thanks for the honesty."
14267,2020-09-29 17:50:32,j1zqm1,Love them so much I named my youngest Seguin. I'm not mad at Benn or Seguin at all. Mostly Klingberg RN for making HORRIBLE passes and our PP for sucking dick
14268,2020-09-29 02:49:58,j1qv7v,"Welp, congrats to the Lightning for getting the job done, especially after what happened last year. As for us, we went much further than expected and it was a fun ride. Today sucked but that's how it goes sometimes  Hopefully we'll be back someday soon. I'm going to go be sad now"
14269,2020-09-29 03:04:24,j1qv7v,"Reminder that Stamkos choose to be there with his team and work on his injury. Being away from his family knowing he may not play.

That is a captain."
14270,2020-09-29 02:50:39,j1qv7v,"Congrats Tampa, the best team won this year. What a run and no Stars fan should feel ashamed of it. Fired coach mid-year and still push to game 6 of the Stanley Cup Finals."

14276,2020-09-29 02:52:52,j1qv7v,"Fucking hell of a team, TB.  Was great to get it to 6, but you guys were like playing an All Star team.  Congrats guys!"

Special teams sucked hard for Dallas and the ridiculous calls both ways hurt Dallas way more than it did for Tampa even if the shitty calls went evenly.

Especially that game 4 officiating fucking sucked."

14456,2020-09-29 04:24:58,j1qv7v,I honestly feel like you guys will make deep runs for years. So much talent and you guys can at any kind of hockey! It was a hell of a series and we showed them two teams from the south can play
14457,2020-09-29 07:16:32,j1qv7v,"Well damn, you just made me feel slightly bad"
14458,2020-09-29 03:07:26,j1qv7v,Agreed. That's legit dedication and love of his team.
14459,2020-09-29 04:02:17,j1qv7v,"Oh Captain, my captain..."
14460,2020-09-29 03:08:30,j1qv7v,"Nah you guys should feel no shame. At all.

Your regular season was hardly promising, for them to come together to take the Finals to Game 6 is legit impressive.

It doesn't hurt any less though."
14461,2020-09-29 03:26:52,j1qv7v,"You guys grabbing Game 5 had me worried, just started to run out of gas today. 

Stars play some good hockey, proud of y'all"
14462,2020-09-29 02:58:59,j1qv7v,Yeah tonight sucked. But I am in now way disappointed in the Stars. Went much further than anyone or myself anticipated. Good season Stars.
14463,2020-09-29 02:55:23,j1qv7v,Same amount of cups as Doughty now lmfao
14464,2020-09-29 03:30:53,j1qv7v,He’s still on the fourth line... He’s STILL on the fourth line.

It was kinda a boss move"

14476,2020-09-29 03:12:18,j1qv7v,They should really tweet this
14477,2020-09-29 03:15:25,j1qv7v,We lost and this was the only thing that was going to make it tolerable and they still fucked me. Year totally ruined
14478,2020-09-29 03:16:09,j1qv7v,I’m glad it still feels so legitimate. Hopefully Yzerman can do this again in Detroit now.
14479,2020-09-29 03:37:25,j1qv7v,Bettman basically said it is an asterisk because it was harder.
14480,2020-09-29 04:48:12,j1qv7v,"I'm biased of course but...I think everyone watching knew it was actual playoff hockey. It had that feel. The Finals in particular were really intense.


And yes. I am proud."
14481,2020-09-29 07:17:27,j1qv7v,"Anyone who says this is an asterisk cup is a fucking moron. It could have turned into one if covid affected a team's ability to put their best roster on the ice. Like imagine if Dallas ends up winning instead because Hedman, Point and Kucherov are out with covid. But there were zero cases of covid during this entire thing which means it was just like any other playoffs."
14482,2020-09-29 13:22:52,j1qv7v,Anyone who implies this is an asterisk cup would be an idiot. It was arguably the hardest stanley cup to be won
14483,2020-09-29 03:13:21,j1qv7v,That is why you watch the SN feed.

And then, IIRC, had a rough start to this season (I might be remembering wrong tho).  To take that and finally live up to your potential, that's nothing short of commendable.  Congrats!"

14499,2020-09-29 03:07:34,j1qv7v,Would be awkward if the Keeper of theCup was also keeper of the COVID.
14500,2020-09-29 03:06:44,j1qv7v,Maybe they weren't in the bubble this entire time? Or it's just a sign of seriousness.
14501,2020-09-29 03:14:23,j1qv7v,I think it’s mostly just a publicity thing. It looks like they’re taking it much more seriously if you can see them all wearing masks.
14502,2020-09-29 07:25:40,j1qv7v,"There are still people moving in and out of the bubble, or people in the bubble getting in contact with people from outside the bubble. That's why they've continued to test for the entire period as well. If they were 100% isolated there'd be no point in testing 2 months after the bubble started.

So basically, they're wearing masks as a preemptive defense in case covid has somehow managed to get in."
14503,2020-09-29 02:59:47,j1qv7v,When is the next season supposed to start anyway? I need more hockey ASAP.
14504,2020-09-29 02:56:24,j1qv7v,That was just depressing.

14534,2020-09-29 02:59:57,j1qv7v,yeah. a cup is awarded nearly every year. THE sweep? lol
14535,2020-09-29 05:00:52,j1qv7v,You remember correctly.  We were at the the bottom of the Atlantic in the beginning and then went on an absolute tear.  Think it was 19(?) straight into covid.

14551,2020-09-29 04:35:30,j1qv7v,Tampa knows all too well the pain of missing Bishop on the playoffs. You guys were so tough! I expect you guys to go deep for years and I have been watching you guys build a power house for the last few years

Dallas was the better team in the odd-numbered periods, but Tampa looked better in the 2nd and the Stars played OT1 like they were turtling on a one-goal lead."

After that rollercoaster of a season every minute of Stars hockey feels like a bonus. Can they take it to a game 7 and win? Doubtful (though... it's 2020), but honestly at that point I don't care as much, they've been great and all the stories (Guru dick trick, Kivi hatty, Dobby, ""we're not going home"", Jamie going beast mode, etc) are gonna sustain me for a while. Would be sweet to win it for sure, but I'm glad they seem to have a lot of fun (even when losing the game) as Segs said in the postgame."

I'll be cheering til the end, but I think the injuries and relentless pressure from the Bolts is going to wear us down and force mistakes and penalties. Dobby is going to have to play out of his mind the next game, hopefully two.

Not to say the Stars are the only team suffering from injuries but the effects are becoming apparent in my eyes. 

Stars in 7!"
14586,2020-09-27 14:46:57,j0rk8n,"I saw a bunch of people venting about the game saying Dallas got lucky by scoring flukey goals. Gritty rebound goals, sure, but those aren’t flukes. That’s just hockey. Tampa is definitely the stronger team, with more highlight reel talent, but goals count either way.


Now to be clear I don’t think the stars will be able to rope-a-dope two more wins this way. Tampa is clearly the stronger team and the stars will have to be their best to force a game 7. Tampa just has to keep doing what they’re doing and they’ll win Monday or Wednesday."
14587,2020-09-27 15:25:42,j0rk8n,"The Stars have been able to generate some more chances late in games 4&5 than they were able to in games 1-3. 

Lightning had an opportunity to shut the stars down and secure the lead, but couldn't really keep dallas out of the zone long enough. If they hold on for about 5 more minutes, dallas gets down to about 3 to play and assuredly are going no goalie to try and tie it up. Lightning have done pretty well all season at 6 on 5, so I like our chances in that moment.

Of course, that's hypothetical. Dallas got it done in the 2nd OT. I make parallels to the ECF because the islanders had the same sort of events happen with the Lightning. I *expect* the Lightning to come out and play more with an edge in game 6. Maybe force a few more mistakes that the refs have to call and capitalize on them in the power play."
14588,2020-09-27 14:09:27,j0rk8n,Was anyone else reminded very much of game 5 of the ECF?
14589,2020-09-27 15:46:57,j0rk8n,Seems that not scoring first hurts us in the long run.
14590,2020-09-27 14:30:31,j0rk8n,So damn close.
14591,2020-09-27 16:13:35,j0rk8n,"How is this for a take:

When the refs call a tight game, strong advantage Tampa

When the refs call a loose game, slight advantage Dallas

Dallas has more or less tried to replicate the approach of St Louis from last year by playing physical hockey. We rely pretty heavily on a physical forecheck and a trap in the neutral zone to force turnovers, when the refs call a tight game it neuters our forecheck and ability to generate offense. We give up tons of shots even at 5 on 5, but we defend as a unit and force teams to the perimeter, more or less trying to bait the other team into taking low quality chances. All this adds up to a situation where when the refs ‘let em play’ we fare better overall, and we fall apart when it becomes a special teams battle, especially because we’re missing Faksa+Comeau right now on the PK."
14592,2020-09-27 21:50:01,j0rk8n,"Stars are gonna have to bring that do or die energy to the game tomorrow. A cornered animal is the most dangerous and there's some vets on the team that really don't want to fucking lose. Just gotta win the game 6, then anything can happen in a game 7. Would love to see this rollercoaster season come down to a winner take all game. That would be incredible."
14593,2020-09-27 14:40:25,j0rk8n,"So many chances through both overtimes, I just knew we were going to let in some rebound to blow it. I'm sure the boys are frustrated too - here's to hoping we execute a bit better Monday."
14594,2020-09-28 00:18:17,j0rk8n,"I'm a little less salty seeing how the series is 3-2 where it should be, But not being able to enjoy last nights game because of how shitty the refs have been really fucking sucks. They were a lot better last night than they've been for most of the series but they still managed to fuck it up in the third."
14595,2020-09-28 02:20:15,j0rk8n,"The line changes up by Bones seemed to work well enough. I hope that they continue to work and then drop a faksa, comeau bomb for game 7 just to see if we can sneak a win if it goes that far."
14596,2020-09-27 14:15:49,j0rk8n,Has Johns been skating does anyone know?
14597,2020-09-27 16:34:22,j0rk8n,Giving up an equalizer when it probably should've been a 4 minute PowerPlay For Tampa is frustrating. But that doesn't change the fact that Tampa still had 35 minutes of play where they couldn't manage to score the winner. Credit to Dallas for managing to keep them out of the net. The lighting need to be able to score and put that game away if they want to win the cup.
14598,2020-09-27 14:32:12,j0rk8n,"Dallas is missing (from their regular season regular roster):

Polak (didn’t return to NHL), bottom pairing defense

Bishop (injured in RR), #1 goalie

Johns (injured in Calgary series), bottom pairing defense

Fedun (injured in Calgary series), #7 defense

Faksa (injured Colorado series), shutdown center,

Comeau (injured Tampa series), checking line wing,

Hintz (injured Colorado series, had tried to play through, now out), #2C,

And also has walking wounded:

Seguin (injured RR), #1C,

Cogliano (injured Calgary series, playing through), checking line forward,

Dickinson (injured Tampa series), middle-6 forward,

Sekera (injured Tampa series), bottom pairing D,

Radulov (injured Tampa), top-six forward.

And that’s just what’s disclosed.

Anyone who doesn’t think that the SCF is an absolute war is effing dumb.  We are effectively down half our top six, half our bottom six, and our 4-7 blueliners AND #1 goalie.  Not saying the series would have been WON by Dallas with a healthy roster, but Faksa alone would have changed the entire series with his defensive play.  He’s the Stars’ top shutdown player and #1 PK.  That alone would have altered games.

Not over yet - Dallas seems to overcome more than they have any right to - but just getting this far with half a roster is as much as any team would have a right to expect, and the Stars deserve mad props for not having a single bit of give-up."
14599,2020-09-28 04:34:36,j0rk8n,"The injuries from blocking shots is a real factor and something teams need to consider when choosing their defensive strategy. I know teams and players get a lot of props for blocking shots, but its a gamble. Every time someone goes to block a shot you run the risk of getting injured. Yeah, its a relatively small risk, but when youre blocking 30+ shots a game that's over 200 shots in a single 7 game series. Even if there is a less than one percent chance of getting injured on a blocked shot you can still lose 1-2 guys a series from blocking shots. 

IMO reliance on shot blocking as a defensive tehcnique isnt worth the injuries it causes. Tampa had the same injury problems under Bowness. He likes his defenders to form a wall and just block shots. Now Dallas is paying the price for mediocre coaching."

14601,2020-09-27 18:35:30,j0rk8n,"I’ve been saying this a bunch, but Tampa seems ridiculously effective at using the short change. When they get a cycle going and their D pinching effectively, it feels like they just have a constant flow of fresh players into the zone."
14602,2020-09-27 16:56:13,j0rk8n,I always think about the Kings vs Rangers SCF and how robbed I felt after it ended at 5 games. It was damn good hockey and I was rooting for the Rangers and Joel Lundqvist’s brother.

Guys like Pavelski are great because they consistently put themselves in position to take advantage of the entropy. That is just hockey baby."
14605,2020-09-27 21:14:16,j0rk8n,Did those people look at Dallas's [shot chart](https://hockeyviz.com/static/img/game/shotLoc/1920/shotLoc-2019030415-DAL-EV.png)? Dallas was all over the front of Tampa's net.
14606,2020-09-27 19:53:36,j0rk8n,"At the end of the day, it’s not “how” but “how many”."
14607,2020-09-27 20:30:53,j0rk8n,I wouldn't say any of Dallas goals last game were flukey. Maybe a few against the run of play but that just seems to be their system.
14608,2020-09-28 04:19:55,j0rk8n,"Tampa is shooting for tips, rebounds, and scrambles just like Dallas is haha. I don't get that logic either."
14609,2020-09-27 14:45:50,j0rk8n,All too familiar. Here’s hoping Game 6 goes the same way too.
14610,2020-09-27 17:48:27,j0rk8n,"Very similar, Shattenkirk gaffe and all"
14611,2020-09-27 14:37:19,j0rk8n,Here's hoping you guys can wrap this thing up in game 6
14612,2020-09-27 16:31:06,j0rk8n,I disagree because refs called the overtime loose and Tampa was absolutely dominant during those periods.
14613,2020-09-27 17:18:17,j0rk8n,"Here's why I gotta disagree with that take: The refs\* (whoops lol)  were calling a loose game the entire time minus those first 2 penalties. Lightning are actually **winning** the loose game. Then while the Lightning are up 2-1 with under 10 minutes, after a high stick on Kuch that draws blood right in front of a ref, the play goes down the other end where the high stick is called on Cernak for high sticking the outside of a guys helmet on the follow through 10 feet away from the ref (they even check for blood ironically). Dallas ties it off that extended offensive zone time from that power play.

So if the calls stayed loose the whole time, Lightning were likely to win that lightly called game still up 2-1. I'm completely fine with the no call for Kuch if it meant no call was about to be called **immediately** following it."
14614,2020-09-28 00:29:03,j0rk8n,Your team wouldn't have beaten Colorado or Vegas if regular season rules applied and the refs did their job lol stop trying to use the refs as an excuse. Tampa has outplayed you almost every period in this series.
14615,2020-09-27 14:52:52,j0rk8n,">So many chances through both overtimes

Really? I only watched part of the 1st OT but I didn't see any real good chances. And wasn't there under 10 shots for both teams combined? I thought that OT was pretty boring tbh."
14616,2020-09-27 14:47:09,j0rk8n,"I said this a year ago and I stand by it, slightly modified:

If Johns is out again due to concussion protocol, I never want him on the ice again.

Playing in the NHL is great - but not at the expense of the quality of the rest of your life.

He needs to hang ‘em up and walk away.

Now if his injury is unrelated - that’s something else.  But given his head injuries, if Johns isn’t on the Stars roster next season, I wish him godspeed and a healthy life.  Won’t be the first nor the last NHL player whose career was cut short due to head injury."
14617,2020-09-27 14:46:55,j0rk8n,"There is no news on that front but I’ll just say it, his head is head is the issue. The fact they haven’t even discussed practicing regarding him is a pretty big tell. He’s the only player We haven’t heard a word about. If it was anything but his head, I think Dallas would get that out there, considering his recent issues."

True words spoken here!  Faksa playing 18-19min a night gives Stars lots of rest too.  Faksa is very much missed!"
14622,2020-09-27 16:40:57,j0rk8n,"Fedun is available. He was unfit for a game or two, and Hanley just kinda earned his way into the regular roster in that last D spot.

Granted, the point about this being a goddamned war still stands. Fedun doesn't lose his spot if he stays healthy."
14623,2020-09-27 14:30:52,j0rk8n,"He’s right you know, gotta go fast!"
14624,2020-09-27 22:41:00,j0rk8n,"i absolutely agree, that series gutted me. would’ve loved to have seen it go to 7"
14625,2020-09-27 16:09:14,j0rk8n,Hey. No.
14626,2020-09-27 17:22:24,j0rk8n,"Don't you want to see a game 7?  This is a great series, I want as much as possible."
14627,2020-09-27 16:34:34,j0rk8n,"The first OT I’d probably agree, tho I do think it’s worth looking at high quality chances - how many did Tampa generate during that first OT? I’d say that’s kinda how our defending is designed to work.

I’m speaking more generally about how the series has gone, one period can buck the trend - I’d also say you guys are exceptionally dangerous when you have the short change."
14628,2020-09-27 17:24:11,j0rk8n,"Counterpoint: look at the expected goals for games 1 and 5, which were called pretty loosely, compared to games 2-4. Despite what the eye test would say about game 5, Dallas generated more quality looks and expected goals."
14629,2020-09-27 19:02:37,j0rk8n,"Agreed, that PP def was a huge momentum shift for the Stars as the rest of the game was pretty loose. At the end of the day a bad call is a bad call and the best teams overcome the adversity, but you do like seeing consistency. If you’re calling certain things (or not) for one team..Maintain that consistency, especially when the one at the other end of the ice drew blood like you said."
14630,2020-09-28 00:53:42,j0rk8n,"amazing - everything you just said was wrong. 

1) we beat Colorado and Vegas despite having more penalties called on us in both series, as well as having penalties called on us at higher rates in these playoffs than we had in the regular season. Colorado out chanced us overall but suffered from poor goaltending - not surprising given they were on their 3rd string keeper by game 7. Vegas outshot us but we generated higher quality chances and expected goals - this is our playstyle.

2) im not using reffing as an excuse for anything, I am saying that the extent to which the refs call a strict or lax game plays a role in the outcome due to the play styles of the teams. im not even making the argument that they should call a strict or loose game, I think the main thing we all would like is some consistency from the refs though.

3) tampa has not outplayed us in every period of the series. they have been the better team in the series, but even in just the most recent period and game, the stars were ahead in quality chances and expected goals - see: our playstyle."
14631,2020-09-27 15:20:32,j0rk8n,"Stars also had something like 11 blocked shots in the first OT. 

Second OT they came out with more energy but the lightning started turning it back in their favor. Dallas capitalized on an opportunity."
14632,2020-09-27 21:47:26,j0rk8n,Khudobin made 2 or 3 tough saves that could have been series enders. Tampa had their chances.

14636,2020-09-27 17:36:56,j0rk8n,"Over which one of Miro, Kling, Lindell, or Rig?"
14637,2020-09-27 21:29:57,j0rk8n,"So.. real question for next year (Not just for you in particular)

Miro, Kling, Lindell, Johns, and Rig are all under contract.

So is Fedun.

Do we just slot in Hanley at 6D after his play in the playoffs?  No FA signing, no re-up for Sekera?

If Johns is done, that opens the door for Sekera to get a new deal, right?  Or do we go another direction altogether?

What about Harley?  Ryan Shea?"
14638,2020-09-27 17:24:53,j0rk8n,"Yeah, what’d we ever do to the Sens? I thought they liked us because of the Spezza connection"

14640,2020-09-27 16:38:49,j0rk8n,"I don't have the stats in front of me but I think Tampa had a lot of high danger chances in OT. A few unlucky bounces to keep the puck out, a few narrow misses, and some excellent goaltending. Dallas really had trouble getting the puck out of their own zone for a lot of the period. But of course all the matters is who can manage to score."
14641,2020-09-27 18:07:50,j0rk8n,"I see your point, and I suppose I agree that in a 100 game series called exactly like that, Dallas would win 60/100 probably. But last night was one of those 40, until it wasn't. Arguing what ifs though, so meh its whatever I get it. I hope there's another good game on Monday!"
14642,2020-09-27 22:52:11,j0rk8n,"Yeah it was the one thing that really annoyed me so hard honestly, but it happens, and if we couldn't close it out the rest of the game including overtime then the Stars earned it anyways."
14643,2020-09-28 00:57:56,j0rk8n,"yeah I think we all would like consistency from the reffing - someone made the point on here earlier that it must be baffling for new fans when sometimes the refs call holds and sometimes they don't. like, in the NFL pass interference and holding is fairly consistent (even if we all still complain about missed call times all of the time)."
14644,2020-09-27 15:45:27,j0rk8n,Stars had 4 high danger chances for compared to 1 for Bolts in 2nd OT.
14645,2020-09-27 19:46:26,j0rk8n,"Sean Shapiro on September 23rd via Twitter - we'll ask Bowness about it, but there are also 3 right-handed D in that photo. The Stars only have 3 RHD in Edmonton, so that could mean Stephen Johns is on the ice. Faksa and Bishop also joined ice late per @ThomasDrance"
14646,2020-09-27 18:05:19,j0rk8n,He didn't even play most of the year. When he came back he was playing really well.
14647,2020-09-27 19:57:28,j0rk8n,John’s was definitely better than Rig but also Rig has gotten a lot better recently. John’s being on the bottom pair is definitely spreading the wealth.
14648,2020-09-28 00:21:24,j0rk8n,I’d love to see them give Harley a shot if they feel that he’s ready. Would have a legitimate offensive threat on every D Pair
14649,2020-09-27 18:33:01,j0rk8n,"Hear me out on this: hockey fans deserve more hockey, so we should all be rooting for game 7. I obviously have no conflicting motivations here and hope it goes to 7 purely because of my love for the game."
14650,2020-09-27 17:10:14,j0rk8n,"Natural Stat Trick credits Tampa with 2 high danger chances in the first OT compared to Dallas' 1. High danger chances in the second OT were 4-1 for Dallas. 18-11 in Dallas' favor for the whole game. 3.88 expected goals for Dallas vs 2.75 for Tampa. Stats that are backed up by hockeyviz's 4.3 expected goals for Dallas vs 2.9 for Tampa. You can get a good visual representation of this with the [Dallas shot map](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ei5OdTTWAAAZDuo?format=jpg&name=medium) compared to the [Tampa shot map](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ei5OdTUWAAAj7U6?format=jpg&name=medium).

This is just the way Dallas plays. They're fine allowing extended zone time in their own end so long as all the shots end up coming from the perimeter with little to no traffic in front. Then in the offensive end, there's an emphasis on working the puck to the dangerous areas rather than just taking shots from the outside. It usually leads to the Stars getting crushed on total shot attempts, but it's usually much closer when it comes to actual scoring chances (and frequently the Stars end up on top)."
14651,2020-09-27 18:30:37,j0rk8n,"I hear ya - not sure why you’re getting downvoted either, your point makes sense. 

Hopefully we get another good game Monday!"
14652,2020-09-28 00:19:02,j0rk8n,"For sure, on the upside we get at least 60 more minutes of hockey. Stoked for tomorrow!"
14653,2020-09-27 16:51:25,j0rk8n,Yeah Tampa was very dominant in the neutral zone and keeping pucks out of their end but they only had 2 HDCF in the first OT.
14654,2020-09-27 16:21:58,j0rk8n,I wonder how many of those came out of the initial rush. I was listening on the radio at that time and didn't get a chance but lightning announcers were talking about how they came out big
14655,2020-09-27 19:51:29,j0rk8n,Well hell yeah!
14656,2020-09-27 19:03:34,j0rk8n,"He was playing great.  Johns is one of my favorite players, and I love watching his bomb of a shot from the point.  However, they weren't inclined to break up the Miro / Oleksiak pairing that had a ton of chemistry, so he was still playing third pairing regardless of his talent level."
14657,2020-09-27 20:26:23,j0rk8n,"Johns is a top-4 guy, but Rig and Miro also have way better chemistry. Johns was holding himself back too much with Miro to let him be the playmaker, which is a waste with the offensive weapons Johns has. Putting him on the third pairing let him open his game up more, and Rig ended up being a more effective supporting partner for Miro, really balances him out well.

Tragically, I think Johns is done. I hope I'm wrong, but I also don't want him to ruin his health, and brain injuries are never worth the risk. I hope we can get pull it out and get him the Cup before he officially hangs his skates up."
14658,2020-09-28 00:32:33,j0rk8n,I'd let Sekera slide for Harley if we have a decent partner for him like Johns or a veteran guy that can clean up his mistakes.
14659,2020-09-27 19:12:22,j0rk8n,"Well. To counter, again... Nah."
14660,2020-09-27 20:21:15,j0rk8n,Interesting!
14661,2020-09-27 20:29:57,j0rk8n,I’d almost be willing to say with 100% certainty his absence this playoffs isn’t head related. If it were I can’t imagine him hanging around the bubble and there have been reports that he’s been seen with a cast on around the bubble.
14662,2020-09-27 20:57:38,j0rk8n,"I definitely hope that's the case, but the one person I saw on twitter mentioning the brace I believe had him mixed up with Faksa on the bench after the WCF win. I could've missed something though, but when he was in the background of some of the post-game wins clips on social media, I didn't see anything. 

If it was his headaches, I could see him staying around for morale (both the team's, and more importantly, his own) and so that he's available for any potential Cup ceremony. Having read [the article on his personal struggle on the Athletic](https://theathletic.com/1882496/2020/06/23/our-son-was-gone-how-the-stars-stephen-johns-found-his-way-back-to-the-nhl/), I wouldn't want him to miss that. If it *is* his head, is there anything they can do for him that can't be done in the bubble?

Either way, I hope he isn't done, and I'm glad he's there with the team."

If Stammer wasn't such an amazing player that had the shittiest run of luck these last few years, I'd be cheering so hard for Pav. 

But I can't not cheer for Stammer. Dude is so disrespected."
14801,2020-09-27 04:10:26,j0kdj1,Tampa had several penalties against them that didn’t get called. Think it’s justice Dallas wins. Interesting  to see how Dallas performs they seemed pretty banged up.

It was really only the long-change periods when the Lightning were putting them on their heels, and even then the Stars did a pretty good job of blocking shots and taking away big chances (like the one where the Lightning centred it right through the crease in OT and Heiskanen completely took his man out of the play)"

I thought it was tripping live, but Radulov was already on his way down when Hedman catches the skate. Lucky break.

I think the trip on cirelli could have been called in that same clip, I think it was Pavs that got him.

14946,2020-09-27 04:21:15,j0kdj1,Pretty sure we get the same crew as in game 4. Which is not good
14947,2020-09-27 04:02:52,j0kdj1,"If only, they have at least one more game to fuck up."
14948,2020-09-27 13:46:27,j0kdj1,"At the same time, losing a double-OT Game 5 and knowing Stamkos is prolly done for the rest of the series is gonna *crush* the Lightning for Game 5. This would've been the perfect time to end it and Dallas manages to rip Tampa's heart out when it seemed like destiny that they'd be crushed.

This honestly feels kinda like the Angels/Giants World Series when it seemed the Angels were dead and buried, then came back to win it all."
14949,2020-09-27 04:20:18,j0kdj1,OT was lopsided. Felt like regulation was two teams trading blows with Tampa having the slight edge
14950,2020-09-27 04:07:35,j0kdj1,"On the flip side, Dallas has won games like that fairly consistently the past few years. I don’t have much confidence in us winning but I guess I’ve seen crazier things"
14951,2020-09-27 04:19:33,j0kdj1,Depends how quickly Dallas can get their injury situation figured out.
14952,2020-09-27 04:10:47,j0kdj1,This definitely felt like our closeout game especially the 1st ot.
14953,2020-09-27 04:40:36,j0kdj1,Dowling looked pretty good tonight but it might have just been because he wasn’t on a back to back.
14954,2020-09-27 12:08:26,j0kdj1,"Faksa is done - rumor is a broken wrist/arm.  Sucks - because aside from an on-his-game Bish, no one player on our side could have made a bigger difference in this series."
14955,2020-09-27 04:47:00,j0kdj1,The hate just makes him more powerful
14956,2020-09-27 05:53:21,j0kdj1,such a Corey Perry thing to do.
14957,2020-09-27 04:13:18,j0kdj1,No take that back
14958,2020-09-27 04:02:21,j0kdj1,Gotta get into the hall
14959,2020-09-27 04:20:38,j0kdj1,R/Hockey would burn to the ground
14960,2020-09-27 10:57:51,j0kdj1,Less of this please
14961,2020-09-27 18:03:21,j0kdj1,Agreed. Game 7 infinite overtime until we're ready
14962,2020-09-27 18:05:22,j0kdj1,Don't do that
14963,2020-09-27 04:07:20,j0kdj1,Maybe regular season but tampa is known to collapse in the playoffs.
14964,2020-09-27 18:08:01,j0kdj1,Someone throw away your hair ties
14965,2020-09-27 04:15:44,j0kdj1,Same for verhagee
14966,2020-09-27 04:18:19,j0kdj1,Just watch game 6 be like 7-1 Tampa.
14967,2020-09-27 05:05:52,j0kdj1,To this day I still see Edmonton as one of the Stars biggest rivals even though nothing has happened in 15+ years lol
14968,2020-09-27 13:58:33,j0kdj1,Come back in two more games for the other team?
14969,2020-09-27 04:26:54,j0kdj1,Same.
14970,2020-09-27 04:11:12,j0kdj1,Right. Just let them play when Kuch bleeds from a high stick with no call and then you get the game tying goal. Good one.
14971,2020-09-27 10:58:28,j0kdj1,NFL.
14972,2020-09-27 04:26:11,j0kdj1,I wish they'd find a middle ground or call the blatant stuff. Like that trip on Radulov needs to be called. Or players just start doing whatever because they know they can get away with it.
14973,2020-09-27 05:57:22,j0kdj1,Well said.
14974,2020-09-27 04:18:20,j0kdj1,All I do is compare it to Weber’s hardest shot (108.5 MPH) and go from there
14975,2020-09-27 04:16:45,j0kdj1,"Let me google that for you, about 153 km/h"
14976,2020-09-27 05:16:40,j0kdj1,I am a Ravens and Stars fan so will be doing some serious pausing And channel flipping

14978,2020-09-27 04:01:50,j0kdj1,"no it does not, did you watch this game?"
14979,2020-09-27 04:08:14,j0kdj1,Lightning were a little too spaced out on our tries it seemed. There were some prime chances we missed on. Dallas got the opportunity for something comparable and didn't waste the opportunity
14980,2020-09-27 05:09:29,j0kdj1,"Absolutely not.

Dallas had the same amount of expected goals in 9 minutes of the 2OT than Tampa had in the entire 1st OT.

The shot counter isnt the be all and end all of hockey"
14981,2020-09-27 04:10:27,j0kdj1,God that sounds so weird...
14982,2020-09-27 04:11:27,j0kdj1,My heart's not broken. We controlled most of the game. I'm not worried at all.
14983,2020-09-27 06:11:40,j0kdj1,"I'm okay with the Bolts winning if it means Stammer getting a cup.

Obviously I'd prefer Pavs to finally win one, but if there's one other option I'm okay with, it's this one."
14984,2020-09-27 12:09:56,j0kdj1,Both teams are getting hosed. Neither team can point to refs as to why they lost because they’re benefiting just as much from non-calls on their own infractions.
14985,2020-09-27 04:12:45,j0kdj1,[deleted]
14986,2020-09-27 04:08:12,j0kdj1,My buddy had a chance to bet on Dallas winning the Cup at +1500 earlier this year and didnt cause the line was too long lol
14987,2020-09-27 18:08:27,j0kdj1,Don't shake pls
14988,2020-09-27 07:20:07,j0kdj1,Neither do the refs so we all just expect chaos
14989,2020-09-27 12:03:24,j0kdj1,"We (hockey fans, collectively) say this literally every single year of the playoffs.  Time for all of us to get over it.  It will never get better."
14990,2020-09-27 04:26:09,j0kdj1,Hard disagree.
14991,2020-09-27 04:50:19,j0kdj1,Wait but didn’t he get the game 4 GWG? Oh wait a Stars player scoring that would 100% make sense....
14992,2020-09-27 04:10:28,j0kdj1,What are the logistics of sending you a keg for Monday?
14993,2020-09-27 04:09:13,j0kdj1,She distracted me more than a few times tonight but fuck Millbury
14994,2020-09-27 04:24:45,j0kdj1,"Take it easy, pizza boy"
14995,2020-09-27 04:26:51,j0kdj1,Yea that one power play we got was certainly handing it over.
14996,2020-09-27 04:15:29,j0kdj1,Yea with tampas 1 whole powerplay lmfao
14997,2020-09-27 04:57:55,j0kdj1,And I mean if that doesn’t work might as well try again Wednesday
14998,2020-09-27 04:01:54,j0kdj1,Why?
14999,2020-09-27 04:53:12,j0kdj1,"I mean to be fair, “letting them play” is arguably why the Kings won in 2012 and 2014 and the Blues won in 2019. Heavy physical play that capitalized on chances"
15000,2020-09-27 04:04:04,j0kdj1,He is indeed.
15001,2020-09-27 04:12:54,j0kdj1,Whats wrong with you? You make me sick to my stomach sharing the same flair.
15002,2020-09-27 04:05:16,j0kdj1,Hard disagree my dude
15003,2020-09-27 04:16:07,j0kdj1,I feel for you guys. Us losing is your Stanley cup
15004,2020-09-27 04:13:50,j0kdj1,How is it displeasing? Sure we were getting our ass kicked 1OT but they came out strong 2OT and fought tooth and nail to win this game
15005,2020-09-27 10:57:49,j0kdj1,"Perry sold his soul, Dobby is a free elf"
15006,2020-09-27 04:55:59,j0kdj1,I mean “not on the scoresheet” but he had 3 points today
15007,2020-09-27 11:00:13,j0kdj1,Never mind the Guri cup shot while on a breakaway.  Or literally of dozens of other penalties uncalled on both teams.
15008,2020-09-27 04:52:25,j0kdj1,there were a ton of no calls on both sides. I don't remember this one tho
15009,2020-09-27 04:15:32,j0kdj1,How so? We put the puck in the net more than they did
15010,2020-09-27 04:27:22,j0kdj1,Deserves got nothing to do with it.
15011,2020-09-27 04:02:23,j0kdj1,"Nah, Perry too gud."
15012,2020-09-27 05:06:44,j0kdj1,"https://www.naturalstattrick.com/game.php?season=20192020&game=30415&view=limited#lbhm5v5

Yes so undeserved. Of course it's a fucking Canes fan that thinks that low danger shots and corsi is all that matters lmao"
15013,2020-09-27 04:05:44,j0kdj1,What? Seriously? How?
15014,2020-09-27 04:14:59,j0kdj1,Not even. You’re lucky that your trips went uncalled or that shit ends in the first OT
15015,2020-09-27 04:07:13,j0kdj1,Wrong
15016,2020-09-27 04:06:02,j0kdj1,"Were we watching the same game? There’s a reason Cooper didn’t challenge it, it wasn’t even that close"
15017,2020-09-27 04:05:06,j0kdj1,Nah that wasn't off
15018,2020-09-27 11:24:19,j0kdj1,"My god you can’t be serious.... you’re teams coach literally watched the replay and decided to leave the bench because it wasn’t offsides. And multiple people reviewed it. 
Are you blind or just incapable of accepting a Dallas goal without blaming the refs"

???"
15020,2020-09-27 05:03:15,j0kdj1,How many games and series do you have to win before you qualify as “deserving”?
15021,2020-09-27 04:54:36,j0kdj1,"Lol if you think what Perry has done is anything compared to some of the players this playoffs, take a look at Tuch during the Vegas series and get back to me on how shitty Perry has played"
15022,2020-09-27 04:03:39,j0kdj1,Watch the replay
15023,2020-09-27 04:27:04,j0kdj1,They showed a replay at the end and he was on.
15024,2020-09-27 04:02:58,j0kdj1,🧂
15025,2020-09-27 04:03:13,j0kdj1,No.
15026,2020-09-27 04:06:29,j0kdj1,Wrong
15027,2020-09-27 11:38:12,j0kdj1,"15 seconds after the goal they showed Jon Cooper watch the replay and actively decide not to challenge the play... 
but yeah everything is totally the refs fault"
15028,2020-09-27 04:06:09,j0kdj1,"That same play occurred back in 2017 against Nashville, but yet the refs deemed it offside and reversed the goal, and the rest is history. But somehow the exact situation occurs and the deemed onside somehow?!"
15029,2020-09-27 05:09:58,j0kdj1,Dude I don’t even feel that way yet and look at my name
15030,2020-09-27 05:52:50,j0kdj1,Lmao you guys are still very much a huge favorite and definitely the way more talented team on paper
15031,2020-09-27 05:24:59,j0kdj1,"dude y'all have got this. unless we come out and somehow take Mondays game, you guys have a really fucking good chance to take it and more than likely will do so. I wouldn't worry unless there's a game 7"
15032,2020-09-27 06:16:57,j0kdj1,"I'm not sure that's fair to the stars tbh. Bolts are damn good, but the stars are forcing them to take low percentage shots.

Doesn't help that Dobby has been good in 3 of the 5 games.

This was always going to be a close series. These teams are far more evenly matched than most gave them credit for.

That said, Dallas is going to run out of players to dress if they keep hurting themselves, so this is probably an inevitability at this point."
15033,2020-09-27 04:51:44,j0kdj1,wait to use this if dallas wins the cup
15034,2020-09-27 04:02:37,j0kdj1,"I wish I did, but I would likely be in the hospital for a heart attack in my 20s."
15035,2020-09-27 04:14:06,j0kdj1,No lie man I didn’t get excited for a single goal this game until Dallas won. I just can’t keep doing these roller coasters of emotion haha

15058,2020-09-27 04:39:02,j0kdj1,Dallas/Avs series was not like the Vegas or Tampa series at all. It was pretty even for the most part.
15059,2020-09-27 04:12:00,j0kdj1,I’m hoping they can come back to win it.
15060,2020-09-27 20:36:25,j0kdj1,"Lol what? We fucking dominated Vegas, they were utterly outmatched. pretty consistently outplayed Avs too. 

You can't just look at the shot totals and pretend to have watched it."
15061,2020-09-27 04:05:52,j0kdj1,This is the way.
15062,2020-09-27 04:14:41,j0kdj1,It’s amazing how similar those two games were.

15064,2020-09-27 04:42:49,j0kdj1,"I swear people just look at the shot counter to determine how a game was played.

Vegas had so many poor quality shots that series. Tampa is 10 times more dangerous than Vegas was.

But this game Dallas had 18-11 High Danger scoring chances and 3.7-2.7 expected goals.

Dallas had double the high danger chances in half of 2OT than Tampa had in all of the 1st OT and Dallas had the best chance by far in the 1st OT when Benn just missed the net from point blank."

Plays on the edge all the time, and has had several dirty/intent to injure plays throughout his career. Knee injury kept him from performing last year, bought out by Anaheim, Dallas picked him up for a ridiculously cheap contract that is incentive based.

15091,2020-09-27 04:05:13,j0kdj1,That commercial is by far the worst
15092,2020-09-27 12:14:05,j0kdj1,"Yes, I do. Also, thanks!"
15093,2020-09-28 00:30:08,j0kdj1,"I forgot Skip. 22 minutes? Nahhh, 25."
15094,2020-09-27 12:13:48,j0kdj1,It was during intermission. No commercials in overtime during game.
15095,2020-09-27 04:05:39,j0kdj1,Amen.
15096,2020-09-27 04:55:58,j0kdj1,Amen
15097,2020-09-27 05:20:10,j0kdj1,Amen.
15098,2020-09-27 05:07:40,j0kdj1,just fuck up my entire life fam
15099,2020-09-27 04:07:19,j0kdj1,"If there's one thing both fan bases can agree on, it's that these refs are absolute garbage"
15100,2020-09-27 13:59:56,j0kdj1,"Stamkos thing is overplayed, team got here without him. He had his moment of magic, team has moved on."
15101,2020-09-27 04:49:42,j0kdj1,"Tampa seemed to have the better overall puck possession but Dallas was able to interrupt the plays enough to keep the number of dangerous opportunities fairly low, and counterattacked well."
15102,2020-09-27 04:29:27,j0kdj1,If we can get faksa back I think we have a shot
15103,2020-09-27 04:05:33,j0kdj1,He already has the hardware frankly.
15104,2020-09-27 04:09:02,j0kdj1,"They've made the SCF twice in 5 seasons, the only other team to do so is Pittsburgh who won two cups, make no mistake, Tampa Bay is good in the playoffs"
15105,2020-09-27 04:16:45,j0kdj1,"I gotta think Bogosian is injured, because he would have been better as a 7th defenseman tonight."
15106,2020-09-27 13:51:39,j0kdj1,Or 2-1 Dallas.
15107,2020-09-27 04:57:00,j0kdj1,Yeah I’ll feel sympathy when Hintz and Comeau are back in our lineup. Until the Kuch can put a bandaid on his cut
15108,2020-09-27 04:37:08,j0kdj1,"Didn't get much sympathy when Roope Hintz got injured for potentially the rest of the series on a blatant trip, call it even."
15109,2020-09-27 04:23:20,j0kdj1,I mean there was also a high stick on the same play from Cirelli
15110,2020-09-27 12:20:50,j0kdj1,"Well then go Friday-Monday, or even Friday-Tuesday."
15111,2020-09-27 04:46:12,j0kdj1,"Agree on blatant calls, but I'd rather be on the completely swallow their whistle than the crap both teams have had to put up the other games."
15112,2020-09-27 04:55:18,j0kdj1,"Guri ripped a 110mph shot to send Vegas home, would have probably shattered glass had he missed the net"
15113,2020-09-27 12:13:27,j0kdj1,"Difference:  NBC broadcasts SNF, not MNF.

The other option would’ve been a 1:00 PM puck drop."
15114,2020-09-27 04:06:02,j0kdj1,Did you see the result? Just saying doing all that and losing isn’t always a confidant boost...
15115,2020-09-27 04:22:04,j0kdj1,"Dallas outplays Tampa and loses game 4.

Tampa outplays Dallas in game 5 and loses.

15118,2020-09-27 12:28:45,j0kdj1,Yeah we cry about missed calls and shit all the time(Blues game 7 I’m looking at you) but this has been on a whole different level. It’s literally every game!
15119,2020-09-28 17:22:59,j0kdj1,If it's a keg of water 👍
15120,2020-09-27 04:04:38,j0kdj1,"Because they kept tripping and hooking us at will, but I'll take the extra time"
15121,2020-09-27 04:04:00,j0kdj1,Missed high stick on kuch that wouldve been a double minor while the lightning were up 2-1. I know the refs had the whistles away so im not going to complain about it but that will be the perspective from lightning fans

15123,2020-09-27 04:06:17,j0kdj1,"Kucherov got blatantly high sticked and was bleeding so lighting should have been on a 4 minute PowerPlay. They called the high sticking on Pavelski almost immediately after. Then Dallas equalize on the PowerPlay and go to OT. So you could make the case if they call the first high sticking, Dallas equalizer never happens."

15128,2020-09-27 04:08:39,j0kdj1,"Kucherov got his face sliced open in front of the ref, no call. Ten seconds later they call a high stick on us, I guess because Pavelski did a better sell job. They score when it should have been a 4 minute power play for us to ice the game"
15129,2020-09-27 12:11:40,j0kdj1,"This.

Tuch literally slew-footed a guy within feet of a watching ref and no call, no suspension.  It wasn’t that long ago that they were saying a slew-foot was a match penalty for intent to injure."
15130,2020-09-27 14:00:06,j0kdj1,"Hell, Reaves fucking headshot a guy in the *exhibitions* and didn't even get *suspended*. The rules have always been fast and loose in certain areas."

15132,2020-09-27 05:40:09,j0kdj1,"We have this about as much as Maroon has an impact on the game. As in to say, we don’t. That’s not how this sport works. That’s not how the *Lightning* work. I’ve known enough horrible pain to know when more is coming."
15133,2020-09-27 04:10:17,j0kdj1,This is what the entire playoffs has felt like for us. It's either taking 10 years off my life or giving me a great set of glutes and amazing endurance.
15134,2020-09-27 04:17:26,j0kdj1,Can confirm this is what happens

15138,2020-09-27 04:19:25,j0kdj1,Jk...GO STARS!

15151,2020-09-27 04:24:24,j0kdj1,can confirm (CGY fan)
15152,2020-09-27 17:06:58,j0kdj1,Avs had no goalie for 3 of 7 games basically.
15153,2020-09-27 22:30:50,j0kdj1,"Dallas got destroyed in shots, offensive zone time, possession, scoring chances, etc in 4 of 5 games. 1 was even. I watched all the games from a neutral point of view."
15154,2020-09-27 04:56:42,j0kdj1,"Also, [this is where Dallas shot from tonight](https://twitter.com/ineffectivemath/status/1310069684948041729?s=21). Prime real estate for goal scoring, and had 4.7 xG compared to 3.3 for Tampa tonight"
15155,2020-09-27 13:07:35,j0kdj1,"Tampa dominated the first OT. I don't know if a blocked shot counts as a high danger scoring chance, but Dallas had one shot, Tampa had 7 and a bunch more blocked, and spent most of the period in Dallas's end of the ice. Dallas was lucky to get through without giving up a goal."
15156,2020-09-27 04:45:59,j0kdj1,"Yea I'm seeing some posts of the shot charts going around and I don't get it...yea Tampa's aren't clustered up next to the net, they don't need to be to score, like how it's been this entire series? They're kinda good with space to work with, not sure if some people on the sub have realized yet."
15157,2020-09-27 13:44:33,j0kdj1,"Morrow gets called in for his 4OT playoff goal to eliminate the Sharks, even if it wasn't in the Cup final."

15173,2020-09-27 04:24:26,j0kdj1,Didn’t see that but should have been called as well. This league is filled with clowns.
15174,2020-09-27 12:31:41,j0kdj1,"So .. push the BTB earlier into the series?  Or just have multiple 2-day breaks when NBC is dying for content, and the league is spending nearly $100m to put on the bubble playoff?"
15175,2020-09-27 04:47:33,j0kdj1,Yea if it's either or then I'm with you.
15176,2020-09-27 04:48:49,j0kdj1,"Yeah agreed, but I have a feeling a missed calls gonna lead to a goal either way and someone will be nightly unhappy about it"
15177,2020-09-27 06:53:17,j0kdj1,It is so overlooked by non Stars fans. But it was a thing of absolute beauty!
15178,2020-09-27 04:08:24,j0kdj1,Did you see the entire rest of the game where they were running around and over Dallas? This is the same thing us Lightning fans said after Game 1 - you're not gonna be able to win two more games playing like that.
15179,2020-09-27 12:21:32,j0kdj1,Hahaha resort do your dumb meme. I'm confident in the Lightning.
15180,2020-09-27 16:39:51,j0kdj1,Its the same as always.
15181,2020-09-27 04:10:06,j0kdj1,Lol.
15182,2020-09-27 04:05:30,j0kdj1,"Missed trip on Radulov on a breakaway, missed trip/hold on Oleksiak behind the net, but please, tell me more."
15183,2020-09-27 04:10:28,j0kdj1,"Yeah but Hedman got away with a trip at the end of the first OT, which took away a mini break away, then the refs also missed an icing call that benefitted you guys too.  However, I think the refs after last game, will be more hesitant to make calls unless they have to.

All that being said, you guys dominated most of the play but just couldn't put away Dallas..."
15184,2020-09-27 04:05:59,j0kdj1,"Oh fuck off, the refs have totally tilted this series to Tampa. It should be 3-2 Dallas"
15185,2020-09-27 04:04:55,j0kdj1,Yep that was probably the worst missed call of the night and the most vital. The stars finally executed when they got a break but that one still burns.
15186,2020-09-27 04:04:56,j0kdj1,"I mean have you guys not been complaining about the same shit, even right now?"
15187,2020-09-27 04:08:34,j0kdj1,"There are missed calls every game, what about the icing that touched your goalies pad? You’re not allowed to whine about Dallas fans crying about Benns penalty and then cry again after a call goes their way."
15188,2020-09-27 04:13:32,j0kdj1,You can’t talk about would’ves and could’ves in sports. I’m sorry.
15189,2020-09-27 04:22:12,j0kdj1,"You are what's wrong with our fan base. Any loss and it's whine whine whine. What, 5 OT in the very first game wasn't enough for you? Killing Boston and the Islanders in OT wasn't enough for you? I want the Cup too but tonight was only game 5. Grow up."
15190,2020-09-27 05:22:58,j0kdj1,"yeah, some would argue with me but the officiating has been somewhat terrible this series. such as the missed icing in ot, so many missed calls on both sides. like what the actual fuck was that embellishment penalty yesterday lol"
15191,2020-09-27 04:12:57,j0kdj1,Everyone just reads “waaaaaaaah waaaaaaah”
15192,2020-09-27 14:44:42,j0kdj1,"I might have been blind back then. But I still didn't see how last night's entry into the zone by Perry, was any fucking different than Forsberg's entry into the zone back in 2017, that led to the goal being disallowed. If anything, Forsberg was onside and should of counted, just like Perry's goal last night did...."
15193,2020-09-27 06:13:02,j0kdj1,"On the bright side, the stars work exactly the same way. Haha.

We're all about that pessimism."
15194,2020-09-27 05:20:18,j0kdj1,"I don't know how the 4th seed ended up being an underdog in every single game they played, but it might be time to take the Stars seriously."

15201,2020-09-27 04:15:17,j0kdj1,I mean he's Dutch Gretzky
15202,2020-09-27 04:46:06,j0kdj1,"Jeez, where did you get that picture--from a JC Penny catalogue?"
15203,2020-09-27 04:32:59,j0kdj1,"Didn't we get like 62 shots on you guys once?

I don't think Calgary can say the same as Vegas. We outplayed you guys most games"
15204,2020-09-27 18:54:05,j0kdj1,"And? 

That doesnt change how even the series was. Hutchinson played well until game 7"
15205,2020-09-27 20:37:08,j0kdj1,"We also have the best goalie in the NHL unfit to play right now, what even are these excuses lmfao"
15206,2020-09-27 14:58:53,j0kdj1,The Benn chance wasnt blocked he just missed top cheese
15207,2020-09-27 08:33:50,j0kdj1,"I haven’t missed watching a Chiefs game with my dad in 23 years so I’ll be recording the Stars game, avoiding the internet, and watching it at like 10 PM... it could be a rough night lol"
15208,2020-09-27 09:48:03,j0kdj1,entirely possible it'll be better than the super bowl like the rams chiefs game was so calling it just a week 3 nfl game is cutting it a bit short

15212,2020-09-27 04:35:21,j0kdj1,Agreed 1000% inconsistent as hell tonight again but you would have had to shoot someone to get called for a penalty tonight.
15213,2020-09-27 04:35:47,j0kdj1,"I thought they were relatively okay today? At the very least, their decision to swallow the whistles and let em play meant we finally got to see a game that was mostly 5 on 5

Edit: *sees downvotes* guess I’m the only one who feels this way, lol. Probably cause I watched the game mostly without sound cause the commentating has been driving me crazy."
15214,2020-09-27 07:10:05,j0kdj1,"Not really a ""welcome"" when 5 games into a series and Tampa has beat that sort of gameplan multiple times before and in this series"
15215,2020-09-27 13:17:28,j0kdj1,Do they need a back-to-back at all?
15216,2020-09-27 04:49:40,j0kdj1,Unfortunately it's the game 4 refs again. So fat chance of that lol
15217,2020-09-27 04:11:52,j0kdj1,Who says they play like that again? Who says Tampa doesn’t shit the bed? That’s why we play the games bud. Stars now have another game to make more adjustments  and find a way to win. More and more doubt.... :)
15218,2020-09-27 13:53:43,j0kdj1,"Like you guys were against Columbus last year. There was no way the record-tying team could lose to a *second Wild Card*, right?

15221,2020-09-27 04:08:30,j0kdj1,And I would agree with all of that? But none of that ever happens if they get the easy call right to begin with.
15222,2020-09-27 04:08:18,j0kdj1,I would say a missed 4 minute PP with 6 minutes left in the game is a pretty big deal. Again im not complain because the whistles were put away with both sides. But go ahead and keep drinking that flint water amd wrecking your reading comprehension chief
15223,2020-09-27 04:14:00,j0kdj1,2-1. 4 minute powerplay with ~6 minutes left in the game. Its probable there is no ot in which hedman trips radulov. End of the day doesnt matter. On to the next one

Like come on."

15229,2020-09-27 04:15:48,j0kdj1,I mean you can talk about it. It won't change anything but silly to say you can't talk about it.
15230,2020-09-27 05:30:48,j0kdj1,"It’s been god awful all series. I’m sure we both are noticing it more since our teams are in it but I feel like it’s bad every year.

No wonder new fans have trouble following hockey when the rules are just made up and changed from game to game."
15231,2020-09-27 14:58:55,j0kdj1,"If I recall correctly, Forsberg had his skate lifted on the trailing foot, so he was entirely in the zone before the puck crossed the blue line. Last night, his skate was still clearly on the line when the puck crossed. Two different situations, both called correctly."

15238,2020-09-27 05:41:25,j0kdj1,We were up 3-0 before you guys got a shot and still lost.
15239,2020-09-27 22:29:49,j0kdj1,"I still think Dallas deserved to win, they won one of 3 games against Hutch. But some of the earlier games in the series Dallas got heavily outplayed only to skate down and score an easy one on Francouz."

15241,2020-09-27 15:49:24,j0kdj1,"I was talking about Dallas blocking Tampa's shots...Benn's real miss was when he decided to pass and Hedman picked it off. The shot he took later was from further out. Or did he have another chance, I can't remember.  
  
Once Dallas made it through the first OT and had a chance to regroup, I wasn't surprised that they won."
15242,2020-09-27 04:36:10,j0kdj1,Yea we noticed that with Kuch LOL
15243,2020-09-27 04:44:50,j0kdj1,"This was the most playoff-esque reffing we've had. Much better than the ""oh it looks like you poked him with your pinky, 2 min"" while missing blatant crap on both sides."
15244,2020-09-27 07:24:03,j0kdj1,"Welcome to Dallas Stars hockey, you may now join the Knights, Avalanche, and Flames who were all picked heavily after 4 games.


Tampa has better players, better coaching, and are more healthy than the stars. No reason for us to win the series. Let’s go to Monday and see how that plays out before you start sweating, alright?"
15245,2020-09-27 15:22:49,j0kdj1,"Well, the choices are either a B2B or a two day break - or a matinee game - to avoid schedule conflicts with SNF, yes.

Given how expensive the bubble is and how low the ratings are going to be for this Sun Belt final (and I speak as a Stars fan) NBC wanted this over and quickly."
15246,2020-09-27 04:14:11,j0kdj1,Yea and who says Tampa doesn't come out and rolfstomp them by 4 goals? If you wanna play hypotheticals all day feel free.

15250,2020-09-27 04:18:07,j0kdj1,"I'm not sure about ""everyone"" but my point was that the refs weren't out to get Tampa here.  They are letting stuff go unless they have to make the call.  Not saying the two instances here are equal though.  But you guys have two more chances to close it out.  I would be upset at my team if they couldn't close out a series with three opportunities, not the blown call during one of the games."
15251,2020-09-27 04:07:17,j0kdj1,"Both fan bases have complained all series and bad missed calls and bad calls both ways, it’s just how it works. Get outmuscled by perry in Ot and find some play earlier in the game to blame it on. Go ahead, I have time."
15252,2020-09-27 15:11:55,j0kdj1,"Yeah the complete lack of consistency must be really confusing to new fans - just look at what they called penalties in game 4 and then what they allowed in game 5, any new hockey fan would be utterly baffled."

But you also lost that game 7-3 so I hardly think you could say you dominated us that game."
15259,2020-09-27 23:53:44,j0kdj1,"You're right, our backup stepped up and theirs didn't. That's the difference. Not that they have an injured goalie and we don't. 

We have literally the best goalie in the world watching from the locker room all playoffs."
15260,2020-09-27 16:05:35,j0kdj1,He had another chance before that right between the hash marks and Vasilevskiy was screened. He had the entire corner open and missed on a rolling puck.
15261,2020-09-27 04:48:36,j0kdj1,The trip behind the net where everyone let up and the commentators were in the middle of saying it was a penalty only for the game to continue with confused commentary and players was peak comedy imo.

You guys definitely arent much worse off losing Bishop when Dobby is the fucking man."

15272,2020-09-27 07:32:31,j0kdj1,"Because I’m not hostile. I recognize the position the stars have been in all playoffs, and apparently you don’t.  

We’ve had three different series we should have lost, but we’re in game 6 of the Stanley cup final now. Should we win? Absolutely not. Can we win? Wait until Monday. 

The stars don’t make sense this year dude. Tampa is great, they’ve shown that, but if the stars win Monday- good fucking luck."
15273,2020-09-27 12:38:12,j0kdj1,How did you read that comment and pick up hostility?
15274,2020-09-27 04:18:23,j0kdj1,"Yes I understand you're confused, I can tell that because I said ""they can't play like they did this game two more times and expect to win"" (ergo, there is no doubt forming), and you responded with an actual hypothetical and not something we just witnessed."
15275,2020-09-27 20:59:44,j0kdj1,"Defending what I say makes me sensitive? So what does that make you? It makes you a lonely, sad individual who has nothing better to do than say on the internet what you don't have the balls to say in person. I would say I feel sorry for you, but you're a nobody.

15287,2020-09-27 04:23:36,j0kdj1,"And I would take my chances on those two games if they were played like tonight, because the Lightning dominated it outside of some flukes and mistakes.

Again, just like game 1 where they couldn't break through. What did they do the next 3 games? Broke through. I'll take those chances all day, and that's just what I said after game 1 as well."

15291,2020-09-27 04:27:53,j0kdj1,"Fair enough, but id argue games 2 and 3 were nothing like 1,4,5 and the stars just shit the bed hard with penalties and defensive mistakes(not taking away from Tampa still gotta capitalize) if game 6 is Iike 4 or 5, watch out because the stars thrive on that.  Especially with that huge win tonight. That was a very Dallas stars game. It should be fun Monday thought no doubt hopefully like last two games"
15292,2020-09-27 04:43:07,j0kdj1,"Am I crazy for feeling like any attempt to shit talk Detroit for being down right now is stupid?

15300,2020-09-26 14:32:55,j06ijo,"So, Lightning fans, do you already have a happy version of the “We don’t have any words...” tweet prepared?"
15301,2020-09-26 14:35:23,j06ijo,"So in interesting thing to note here: over the last 2 games Tampa's pp went from about 17.9% to 22.5%, and their pk went from 82.something% to 85.2%

Meanwhile, Dallas' pp went from 26.something% to 23.8%, and their pk went from 83.something% to 79.8%

Needless to say, Dallas needs to stay out of the box, and the refs will probably swallow their whistles tonight so honestly I expect Dallas to live to fight another day. Tampa almost certainly wins overall, but I think it'll be in 6 instead of 5

Also, yes that was a fucking penalty. Could've called Holding, Holding the Stick, Tripping, Slew-footing, or Interference. Either way it's a 2-minute minor. If there was ever a time to outright call ""2-minutes for 'You Can't Do That'"", it'd be then"
15302,2020-09-26 14:02:32,j06ijo,When you are given opportunities you have to take advantage of them.

I’ll be happy for the lightning but goddamn it im lowkey like “YOU DONT EVEN UNDERSTAND THE JOURNEY” haha"

15306,2020-09-26 14:14:29,j06ijo,"It was a penalty, it doesn't really matter if it's a trip or a hold or whatever. It was a bad play by Benn."
15307,2020-09-26 14:26:32,j06ijo,"Last night, I really felt like the Lightning wanted this. It was amazing how they just didn’t give up. The fire was there. Hopefully we can keep that going."
15308,2020-09-26 15:54:54,j06ijo,"i said this a few games back and it bears repeating - there is nothing wrong with dallas toeing the line between physical and penalized. that's a line you kind of have to live with if you want to win a cup. their main issue is they can't kill penalties or score on their own power plays

they've given up 5 more pp goals than they've scored and 5 of the 6 pp goals they've given up came in games decided by 1 goal, that's why it's 3-1 and not 2-2 or 1-3. they need their penalty kill to back up their physical and borderline play and it hasn't happened"
15309,2020-09-26 15:55:28,j06ijo,Tough loss but this Tampa team is just built to win a cup right now.  They were already one of the most stacked team of the cap era and fixed pretty much their only flaw at the trade deadline.
15310,2020-09-26 14:28:48,j06ijo,"Dallas’ special teams are cooked. The PK is ravaged by injury and being overworked while the oddly hot PP has returned to freezing cold. You can have one hot and one cold, just not both. 

Dallas is actually winning the 5v5 game 10-8! If Dallas had some god damn discipline, I truly believe they could conceivably be up 3-1. Alas, the hole cannot be deeper."

15313,2020-09-26 15:34:06,j06ijo,"After Dallas got a chance in the OT on the Sergy hold, they HAD to know there was likely a call coming to even up the chances.   Could smell that coming a mile away especially with the Point-Perry thing in consideration."
15314,2020-09-26 16:39:27,j06ijo,"I truly believe the bubble effect on the refs has been understated. These guys have been stuck in there since July having to call highly emotional and intense games but unlike the players, they’re not chasing any glory or making millions. That’s gotta be tough as hell mentally and unfortunately it seems to be having an effect on the game. Not even talking about the Benn penalty, that was the right call, but just in general across the entire postseason and the series. It does suck that it seems to be putting a bit of a stain on what is a dominant run by Tampa and a Cinderella story by Dallas. 

I also think Dallas has done about all it can do with the injuries we’ve sustained. Dobby is awesome but he’s not a Vezina caliber goalie like Vasilevsky and his teammate Bishop. He’s put in some incredible performances and you can’t really blame him for any losses but a guy like Bishop can take over a game. Also the injury to Faksa and now Comeau completely stifles our PK. When Cogliano went to the box we were basically fucked cause those 3 guys are our best PKers. We’ve been lucky to not lose any star players(minus Seguins shot) but when you’re in the finals, even losing depth guys like that is gonna make a huge difference and you can really see it by Tampa’s best players producing. Tampa doesn’t have to rely on their depth much because we don’t have the players defensively right now to slow down the top line like we did when we played Colorado. 

That’s the nature of the postseason though, and I’m still happy to even be here. Hoping we can make history and at least get this to a game 7."
15315,2020-09-26 15:06:08,j06ijo,"come on Dallas I wanna see 7 games, gotta stay out the box that simple let’s fucking go"

15318,2020-09-26 14:49:00,j06ijo,"To me I’ve learned that not everyone will ever be happy with the officiating amongst fans

Swallow the whistles and people get mad that certain calls aren’t getting called. Call it like it is and people will always claim bias or inconsistency 

It always seems like a futile effort when there’s like a dozen other reasons for both teams why the series is 3-1 right now. Complaining about reffing either way let’s fans have a semblance of justifying the results without fully blaming their team play"
15319,2020-09-26 14:40:05,j06ijo,"If they were calling the games in the typical playoff style, we’re all OK with that. This series has been inconsistent and bad in different ways each game."
15320,2020-09-26 14:33:26,j06ijo,It's going to be interesting to see what the refs do. It's a back-to-back game after OT so you know the players are going to be exhausted but it's also an elimination game so you know they are going to battle for every puck.
15321,2020-09-26 16:13:46,j06ijo,The refs definitely swallow

Thank you. I’m seeing people trying to compare this to the worst calls in the history of the sport. Maybe the communication about the call was really dumb, but it was a penalty.

If Dallas stays out of the box, considering 3/5 of our goals came off PPs, I think they could take this one."
15327,2020-09-26 15:53:38,j06ijo,"Everyone thinks the refs swallow their whistles tonight, so in typical 2020 fashion I expect 6 PPs each."

15331,2020-09-26 16:11:34,j06ijo,"We understand the journey just fine.  We were a horrible team from 92 to about 2001 or so.  won the cup in 2004; from 2006 to around 2014 terrible again.  Awful ownership, etc during that time.  Bolts haven't won after being a very good team for the last 6 years or so; with no results.

I know there was a long history of Caps being great but not getting to the prize till 2 yrs ago, but hey, it's not like success has fallen into the TBL lap."
15332,2020-09-26 15:15:59,j06ijo,Damn so if they choke and lose in 7 are you gonna feel good about her suffering? 🤣
15333,2020-09-26 19:45:22,j06ijo,"Lol my sister refused to watch hockey always saying “it’s a bunch of Canadians figure skating.” Well. She finally caved and ended up watching the 2013 Hawks run while her husband was deployed. Now her and her husband travel around specifically for Blackhawks games. Even though she totally bandwagoned at probably the best time to bandwagon the Blackhawks, it’s totally worth having her to talk about hockey with."
15334,2020-09-26 14:18:36,j06ijo,He probably thought he could get a freebie at that point in the game. It was a bad play that could end up being the turning point in the series. He cost his team the opportunity to tie it up.
15335,2020-09-26 14:47:14,j06ijo,"And the bad calls all series beforehand does not negate the fact that he could have had 2 or 3 penalties called against him in a single play.

Anybody who says ""that wasn't a penalty"" is through the looking glass and peering into an alternate reality."
15336,2020-09-26 20:24:54,j06ijo,"And the Stars can only blame themselves, Seguin was wide open on the 4-on-3 and he was having one of his best games in a long time, he's got to bury that."
15337,2020-09-26 16:04:25,j06ijo,"Yeah, oddly for the Bolts, both PP and PK are hot at the same time; I'm guessing a fair amount of the PP success is DAL having PK players out (Not sure how much each contributes, but Comeau, Faksa, and Hinz (I think)."
15338,2020-09-26 17:04:04,j06ijo,Tampa has been very lucky with injuries in the finals
15339,2020-09-26 15:13:09,j06ijo,You had a 4 on 3 and a 5 on 4 you have to capitalize on your chances that’s the only way you’re going to win

I don’t think there was an actual bias last night, some questionable things both ways and just overall shitty calls the whole series."
15342,2020-09-26 14:57:24,j06ijo,"No, nothing is worse than bad calls"
15343,2020-09-26 15:37:20,j06ijo,"Swallow the whistles: ""What's with all of these non-calls, that was an obvious hook/trip/hold, refs blind, refs hate my team""

Call penalties: ""What the fuck, it's the playoffs, let the boys play, refs are inserting themselves in the game, I didn't come here to watch the refs, fucking egotistical refs have to make it about themselves""

The referees can never win"

15353,2020-09-26 17:43:29,j06ijo,"Yeah everyone thought that going into Game 3. And then Game 4.

I expect more shit calls both ways tonight."
15354,2020-09-26 14:39:44,j06ijo,They also scored 1 on Tampa’s power play. Should we count that?

15359,2020-09-26 14:39:10,j06ijo,He basically said this much after the game. Something like “it’s OT we expect it to be 5 on 5”
15360,2020-09-26 15:20:26,j06ijo,Right if Dallas was able to hold out and get a lucky bounce in overtime this is such a different series.
15361,2020-09-26 16:31:23,j06ijo,"Yeah missing those three is rough. They’re leaning hard on Janmark, Dickinson, Cogliano and Pavelski and they’re tired. They’ll throw Benn and Seguin out there for faceoffs but they can’t kill. It’s a bad spot to be in."
15362,2020-09-26 18:18:13,j06ijo,"I wouldn't say they've been lucky, they've only had Stamkos for 2 minutes the entire series. Both teams have their problems but unfortunately ours are just looking like too much for us to overcome."
15363,2020-09-26 18:33:14,j06ijo,"How are they lucky? If both teams were at 100%, the Lightning would look much better on offense and the same on defense. Stamkos back in the lineup causes the Stars to deal with another 1C to defend. And if he played wing, there's no defensive unit that can handle a line of Kucherov-Point-Stamkos."
15364,2020-09-26 15:22:59,j06ijo,Wow the downvote brigade hit me hard lol Im not discounting that point just saying that the refs sucked and I'm hoping for some good 5v5 hockey. Didn't think that was too wild of an opinion.
15365,2020-09-26 15:59:57,j06ijo,The game was literally decided on a penalty that doesn't get called 9/10 times. What are you smoking?
15366,2020-09-26 14:40:26,j06ijo,"Yeah but not calling anything would increase the risk of injuries immensely, especially since they are already exhausted and it being an elimination game."
15367,2020-09-26 15:06:29,j06ijo,A bad non call is still a bad call.
15368,2020-09-26 17:14:30,j06ijo,"I hate tightly regulated games, but I would rather have a tightly regulated game then headhunting and slewfooting go unpunished."
15369,2020-09-26 18:27:57,j06ijo,"They can never win because they're not fucking consistent. Let them call both playoff and regular season games the same way for a few years and then we'll see how much less scrutiny they get.

Believe it or not, hockey has the best refs out of any major sport in the US. Their only downside is that they call games different depending on the situation, which leads to bullshit inconsistencies like we saw last night and the game before."
15370,2020-09-26 15:14:34,j06ijo,True! It’s just tarnishing this series.

15374,2020-09-26 15:56:51,j06ijo,"Exactly.  Bolts PP was awake at just the right time, after going thru some dry spells earlier in the playoffs.  Last nite 3 for 4; DAL 0 for 4, incl a 4 v 3.  I know DAL has guys out who are big part of their PK, so maybe that explains it."
15375,2020-09-26 14:42:59,j06ijo,Damn. So it wasn't even an honest mistake he did it intentionally and thought he would get away with it.

15380,2020-09-26 17:40:08,j06ijo,The only penalty that was more blatant than Benns penalty was the two high sticks the refs missed. Tampa could’ve had 6 power plays easily

15384,2020-09-26 15:17:08,j06ijo,"It just fuels my hatred for referees in general, in all sports. I really need robo-refs to take over ASAP.

Referee unions make me question the validity of unions. Like I *actually* end up agreeing with the corporation after seeing the shit-tier, criticism-proof BS that are referee unions."

The back ref calls it,"" Stars center Joe Pavelski said. ""I don't have a ton of time for a play where Tyler Johnson steps in front of Jamie Benn, and [it] has no real effect on the play. Jamie breathes on him, and the guy falls over. Whether that's the case or not, there's a little battle going on there. But it's the playoffs. It's overtime. We expect 5-on-5. We expect to battle it out. It's unfortunate."""

15393,2020-09-26 18:34:47,j06ijo,You said the refs decided this game. That's 100% not true. The Stars got outplayed and the refs weren't going to change that. Don't backtrack and say that the refs were bad when that wasn't your original statement.
15394,2020-09-26 17:59:18,j06ijo,That penalty gets called every time

Uh bro, you had a 4v3 PP like 3 minutes earlier. What?"
15396,2020-09-26 17:57:41,j06ijo,If it's a penalty in one game it's a penalty in all games. Plain and simple

15399,2020-09-26 15:20:29,j06ijo,And that 4v3 was off of a weak hold even less aggregious than the mugging Benn gave Johnson. In OT. The cognitive dissonance here is unreal.
15400,2020-09-26 19:07:05,j06ijo,They were both even in terms of bad calls and non-calls. You're the homer looking to blame anything other than your team's inability to capitalize on any power plays. The Stars are an inferior team because of it.
15401,2020-09-26 15:36:24,j06ijo,"The bias here is unreal, lol."
15402,2020-09-26 19:09:57,j06ijo,You should probably flair up before pulling the homer card bud.

there's a trend here lately in Korea where I live called ""crowaffle"" meaning croissant+waffle. You buy frozen croissant dough (already rolled and shaped) and put it in your waffle iron and boom, crispy amazing on the outside, soft and flaky doughy on the inside. Put some jam or whatever on top and just a great alternative to waffles/pancakes.

I want to tell you about the Odyssey. It follows the Greek hero Odysseus, king of Ithaca, and his journey home after winning the Trojan War. It takes Odysseus ten years to reach Ithaca after the ten-year Trojan War. In his absence, Odysseus is assumed dead. But in the end, Odysseus returns home, and makes everything normal again. 

Along this road, we are Odysseus. Ever since the Calgary series we have been presumed dead. No one thought we would make it this far. No one thought kivi could play. No one thought we could beat MacKinnon. No one thought we could be Vegas.

But guess what? We did.

Tonight, and every subsequent night that we have a game, there’s a very real risk that it will be our last game. That this magical run will come to an end. That Dobby, Kivi, Pavs, Gurianov, will have to wait another year to take another shot at getting their ring.

All we can do is climb. 

All we can do is survive. 

3 wins away from that cup boys

Let’s get it done.

***We are Dallas***

***We Will Survive***

#SOYEZ FORTS. METTEZ LE VERT. GO STARS."
15561,2020-09-26 13:25:24,j05mwi,"Hoping this isnt another ref shit show like last night. Good luck, boys."
15562,2020-09-26 14:35:48,j05mwi,"My superstition is that they do better when I'm busy with something else. So, tonight I'm going to have the game on mute in the background as I sew some Texas flag masks."
15563,2020-09-26 19:37:29,j05mwi,"After our embarrassing round robin, the only thing I asked from our team was to look like we belong here. Especially after getting the nod over Edmonton. They did that and more. So once again tonight I ask, look like we belong here"
15564,2020-09-26 21:37:35,j05mwi,Let's go boys!!! We are the comeback kids!! We're not going home!!!
15565,2020-09-26 22:06:09,j05mwi,"Just try your best boys, it's been a fun ride"
15566,2020-09-26 22:57:49,j05mwi,"Dallas Stars vs Tampa Bay Lightning and the NHL Refs, tonight at 7pm."
15567,2020-09-26 23:03:02,j05mwi,"Whatever the outcome tonight, I am just hoping for good sportsmanship. It's important that we show respect to our opponent, the League, and the history of the sport. We should show how our team can be stewards of the game and honor both clubs by playing a clean match. Officials have served with dignity in a hard fought series and we should be kind to them and empathetic. Also, everything you just read is horseshit and we should stomp these Floridian fools by any means necessary."
15568,2020-09-26 23:18:37,j05mwi,"I got a Seattle Kraken hat in the mail and wore it the day we started the CGY series comeback and I've begrudgingly worn it since to keep the trend going. After these last few losses though, no more superstition for me. All Stars today. Whatever the outcome, it's a victory green Saturday in this house. LET'S GOOOOOO STARS!!!!!"
15569,2020-09-26 23:52:04,j05mwi,"My coping mechanism: I'm setting aside the whole idea of winning/losing the cup in my brain. At this point, I'm rooting for MORE HOCKEY! I'm not ready for this season to be over, so I want the Stars to win so there's still hockey on Monday!"
15570,2020-09-27 00:11:07,j05mwi,This moron just said we haven't had Faksa all playoffs long
15571,2020-09-27 00:11:26,j05mwi,"Tuning in after a 14 hour drive, pls let me pass the fuck out happy. 

Maybe watching from a different state is the mix up this team truly needs."
15572,2020-09-27 00:17:43,j05mwi,I think we have to break out the Czech Stop kolaches for this occasion.
15573,2020-09-27 00:48:26,j05mwi,Damn this period blew by fast
15574,2020-09-27 00:49:58,j05mwi,About as great a period you can ask for from Dallas. This is a goat stars team no matter the outcome.
15575,2020-09-27 00:52:59,j05mwi,Nothing better than seeing r/hockey seethe when Perry gets a goal
15576,2020-09-27 00:54:35,j05mwi,No mistakes!! We looking good!
15577,2020-09-27 01:21:10,j05mwi,I'm about to bitch slap these biased ass cheerleaders
15578,2020-09-27 01:33:00,j05mwi,"Holy fuck, imagine if we could use a full power play instead of 20 seconds."
15579,2020-09-27 01:38:02,j05mwi,"As a Habs fan. The Habs can't even get past the first round when they ice their best players.

And here we have a TBL team that is missing a world class player like Stamkos and they breezed through the entire playoffs. That pisses me off."
15580,2020-09-27 01:59:04,j05mwi,If we win I'll get whatabeez. Guys I really want Whataburger. Let's fucking go Stars.
15581,2020-09-27 02:02:07,j05mwi,Sekera is back <3
15582,2020-09-27 02:14:30,j05mwi,I believe.
15583,2020-09-27 02:18:48,j05mwi,We used up all our puck luck getting here.
15584,2020-09-27 02:29:07,j05mwi,That’s America’s ass!!!!
15585,2020-09-27 02:29:11,j05mwi,Seguin with four assists in the last two games.
15586,2020-09-27 02:45:36,j05mwi,OLEKSIAK LOOKING REAL SEXY TONIGHT.  LOVE THE AGGRESSION.

15598,2020-09-27 01:00:36,j05mwi,"Hey all you cool cats and kittens. Carole baskin here, just wanted to remind you to not go into the Lightnings subreddit to troll. 

You will be fed to the tigers...I mean banned from this subreddit and the lightning subreddit.

You also don’t look cool. So don’t do it."

15603,2020-09-26 22:49:32,j05mwi,"Backs against the wall. We need to come out swinging. Seguin was on a different level last game and I expect him to keep it up. He should find the back of the net this time and I think that will make the difference. Benn will probably be playing with a chip on his shoulder. Expect big hits from the Captain. Pavelski knows that his window for winning a Cup is closing fast. He will do whatever it takes to make sure we have a chance. Final score 3-2. Goals by Seguin, Gurianov, and Pavelski."
15604,2020-09-27 00:08:34,j05mwi,"The dirty bastards took out Roope. They've embellished all series long. We can still come back. This is still ours to win. People saying that we have no chance of winning the cup are a bunch of losers. We've come back before. We sure as hell can do it again. **LET ME HEAR YOU LOUD AND CLEAR STARSFAM!**

Let's get to work."
15607,2020-09-27 00:17:16,j05mwi,We play way better in our away colors lol
15608,2020-09-27 00:19:17,j05mwi,"Well no matter what happens, remember the Dallas Stars will be playing in the final game of the season."

15610,2020-09-27 00:58:53,j05mwi,Does Perry have a bulldog?
15611,2020-09-27 00:59:15,j05mwi,Man Maroon seems really fucking stupid
15612,2020-09-27 01:20:34,j05mwi,We're chasing the puck and scared of their shooting. That has to stop or we lose.
15613,2020-09-27 01:34:05,j05mwi,Guri has to stop his case of the whiffs. It's frustrating.
15614,2020-09-27 01:34:31,j05mwi,Last 40 sec of the pp was pretty good. Took WAY too long to get set up in their zone though
15615,2020-09-27 01:36:12,j05mwi,How did the pass go between two stars :(

15619,2020-09-27 01:54:28,j05mwi,Win one period. Fight another day. THIS DAY WE FIGHT

15648,2020-09-27 00:21:17,j05mwi,We definitely saw that anthem earlier in the series. She had the same outfit and camera angles. I remember being distracted by her sleeves.
15649,2020-09-27 00:34:24,j05mwi,I know this is playoff hockey and I love the physicality but for fucks sake if I guy releases the puck and takes a hit 2 seconds later that should be called
15650,2020-09-27 00:34:58,j05mwi,"The refs and dogshit commentary all series has really taken all the hype out of this series for me. Look, I can live with losing to TB straight up..they're really good. But is it too much to ask for a cleanly officiated game and commentators who know our players names? Yes. Apparently it is too much to ask for."
15651,2020-09-27 00:39:44,j05mwi, Jason Dickinson tonight before the game:  I AM A HOCKEY PLAYER! YOU WANT ME TO PLAY ON ONE LEG? HUH? I'LL PLAY ON ONE LEG!

15659,2020-09-27 00:53:40,j05mwi,"You know the thing u/FlayvaFlayy said about our forecheck being neutered by the refs? That shit also affects our ability to let the defense pinch into position too. *THINK*  

It forces us to ease our aggressiveness in general and move our D to neutral zone positioning instead of stuffing the opposition pinned into their zone as we create turnovers when we're buzzing.

Downstream effects

If I was a coach or a player on this team I will ERUPT after the game win or lose. Two clearly missed tripping calls and what the fuck was that icing? NHL is making it clear with their agenda to give Tampa the cup to further the growth of the sport in Florida.

15713,2020-09-26 14:22:28,j05mwi,"I updated this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/DallasStars/comments/iyx93h/chances\_to\_win\_cup\_after\_game\_3\_of\_2019\_and\_2020/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/DallasStars/comments/iyx93h/chances_to_win_cup_after_game_3_of_2019_and_2020/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

I used a back-solver (Brent-Dekker) to determine the *approximate* win probability that Moneypuck is using, which is Pr\[Tampa\]=53.85% (estimate).  Using the same metrics:

Tampa in 7 = 11.47%

Tampa in 6 = 24.85%

Tampa in 5 = 53.85%  (duhrrr)

**TOTAL Tampa = 90.17%**

**TOTAL Us = 9.83%**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

`A BRIEF FOOTNOTE ABOUT PROBABILITY:`

`Slim events can happen.  If it's in the sample set, it's possible.  As a real life example, I once sat at a craps table and saw 3 consecutive ""crap twelve"" rolls.  In set theory, the probability of this happening is (1/36)^3 = 2.143347050754458e-5  or  .00214%.  Yet it happened, not making this up.`

Back to hockey, since each game is independent of the past, we just go at it one game a time.  We can still win this!"

We gave up a soft goal and had a defensive breakdown lead to a breakaway goal. The game should have ended 4-2 Dallas, but we made a couple of mistakes. We had a 4v3 in OT but couldn't cash in.

&#x200B;

We've gotten RAILED by the officials so far in this series but absolutely every game has been one our boys could have won. If anyone can come back to win 3 games straight, it's our boys.

16415,2020-09-26 15:18:04,j05mwi,"I’m still bummed.  I will say one more thing about last night and let it go.  IF we had won that game, Tampa fans would have been complaining/irate about the officiating as well, and rightfully so.  That’s my issue.  Either way with the way the game was called one fanbase was going to be pissed.  To not say so is disingenuous and there lies the problem.  

Anywho.  I’m proud of our boys.  I feel for the coaches because now they’re in an impossible situation.  Damned if they do.  Damned if they don’t.  Dobby is tired.  Fatigue is clearly there as there were 2 goals uncharacteristic of him.  Is Bish healthy enough to play him in a game where handshakes are on the line?  Against his former team?  Do we throw Otter out and see what he’s got?  I honestly have no idea which way they go with the decisions tonight.  Our pk is decimated by injuries.  Either way I’m here.  Always have been, always will be.  

Les mis feels appropriate today my friends.  GO STARS! 


My place is here

I fight with you


One day more

We will join these people's heroes

We will follow where they go

We will learn their little secrets

We will know the things they know


One day more

Watch 'em run amuck

Catch 'em as they fall

Never know you luck

When there's a free for all

We'll be ready for the schoolboys
Tomorrow we'll be far away


Tomorrow is the judgement day

Tomorrow we'll discover

What our God in Heaven has in store

One more dawn

One more day

One day more"
16416,2020-09-26 15:48:27,j05mwi,"I’m worried about the refs tonight. It’s clear the commish and everyone that put this bubble together is ready to get out of here, I mean they scheduled a back-to-back in the freaking Stanley cup. Who’s to say they don’t prefer this to end right now tonight?"
16417,2020-09-26 20:40:50,j05mwi,"Well boys I have to say, I feel fine this afternoon. This season has been a rollercoaster and I’ve had so much damn fun rooting for these boys and seeing the level of success they’ve achieved. This isn’t the end of our window, this is the beginning. Our best defenseman is 21 years old, our top regular season scorer is a rookie. The fact most of our best players are still under 30 is really exciting to me. As much as I love and am so happy for him, Rick Bowness should not have been able to lead this hockey club to a Cup Final and he managed to against all odds, what a story. I’m at peace with the likelihood of how this series will play out, but with Dallas I can’t help but hold on to a sliver of hope. I know not what the future holds but regardless of what happens from here I am so proud of this team this year.

I’m not sure if I’ll be emotionally ready to see our bench however if we don’t end up pulling off our own Mirocle on Ice. I hope the boys can hold their chins high."

16631,2020-09-27 04:01:05,j05mwi,COREY PERRY IS OUR SAVIOR!
16632,2020-09-27 04:01:09,j05mwi,FUUUUUUCK YESSSSSSSS.
16633,2020-09-27 04:01:09,j05mwi,GAME 6 ENERGY BOYS!! LET’S GET THIS TO A GAME 7
16634,2020-09-27 04:01:10,j05mwi,HEELLLLLZZZZZ YYEEEEAAAHHHHHHHHH
16635,2020-09-27 04:01:17,j05mwi,STARS FUCKING WINN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
16636,2020-09-27 04:01:20,j05mwi,BOLTS LOOKING REAL TIRED THERE AT THE END
16637,2020-09-27 04:02:07,j05mwi,TAMPA ARE GONNA BE CHOKERS FOR LIFE!!!!
16638,2020-09-27 04:02:47,j05mwi,Two fucking games
16639,2020-09-27 04:02:59,j05mwi,"LET THEM PLAY ZEBRAS, AND WE GET A FAIR GAME."
16640,2020-09-27 01:17:30,j05mwi,IM GOING DOWN WITH THE SHIP LIKE THE MOTHERFUCKING TITANIC
16641,2020-09-27 02:19:49,j05mwi,"Refs got Tampa their 3-1 lead, and then swallow their whistles.  We're about 3 minutes away from a soft penalty against Dallas to take two minutes off, while giving Tampa a chance to seal.  Bet."
16642,2020-09-26 15:30:13,j05mwi,"I wanna be hopeful. We've gotten progressively better at figuring out how to put it in the net. It pains me to say it, but I just really don't know if Dobby is the goalie we need against Tampa. He doesn't have the height to see through screens or cover the net on breakaways, which are the two primary ways Tampa has scored. He's been great until this series, but we need to gamble on someone else tonight."
16643,2020-09-26 18:03:12,j05mwi,"Bishop, Faksa, Comeau, Hintz, Johns, are all unfit to play per Bowness."
16644,2020-09-27 00:04:43,j05mwi,"1-0 from here on out. That’s the mantra. 

Whatever happens, it’s been a fucking ride and I praise the Mooterus for all eternity."
16645,2020-09-27 00:31:54,j05mwi,"Seguin is hungry,  let him score"
16646,2020-09-27 00:42:48,j05mwi,Can we get a goddamn hooking call?
16647,2020-09-27 00:52:33,j05mwi,I seriously wonder if Vegas would have been allowed to be physical with the Tampon Bay Olympic Dive team. I have a feeling they would have been allowed since the NHL actually likes them. One thing is for sure: NBC would know their players names.
16648,2020-09-27 01:15:47,j05mwi,That one is on Dobby.  Yikes.
16649,2020-09-27 01:26:19,j05mwi,I wonder how this would be playing out if we had all our guys
16650,2020-09-27 01:36:16,j05mwi,Seguin watches one go right by him with an open look wtf
16651,2020-09-27 02:12:41,j05mwi,"It finally hit me.

Vasy looks like Evil Peter Parker in Spider-man 3"
16652,2020-09-27 02:15:26,j05mwi,"I wish they’d call an obvious dive for what is it just one fucking time. Up 2-1 and they get tapped, double knee dive to the ice"
16653,2020-09-27 02:51:33,j05mwi,"IF YOU GO TO OLD.REDDIT ON DESKTOP, YOU WILL FIND THE ENTIRE SUB IS NOW IN ALL CAPS."
16654,2020-09-27 03:27:00,j05mwi,WHY?  WHY DON'T YOU SHOOT THAT!?
16655,2020-09-27 03:29:08,j05mwi,"I'm a habs fan cheering for you guys

Good luck, it's a bit late for me"
16656,2020-09-26 17:33:12,j05mwi,"Do I think we win the series? Probably not.

Will I cuss and turn my TV off if we lose another game? Yes.

But damn if this hasn’t been a fun and unexpected ride for the last nearly 2 months. What a great distraction from all the craziness in the world. 

I know the Stars will fight like hell. Let’s go 1-0 on the day."
16657,2020-09-27 01:23:07,j05mwi,"As a VGK fan, I am deeply sorry you have to listen to these clowns deep throat TB. 🤦‍♀️ where are the dudes who gargled the stars during our series?! Bring them back!"
16658,2020-09-27 02:08:11,j05mwi,"Don't try and sound too fucking excited Doc, you fucking biased piece of shit."
16659,2020-09-26 17:31:41,j05mwi,"Win or lose, you have to give the Lightning credit for adjusting to our playing style really fast, whereas we’ve been making the same fucking mistakes for 3 games now. Refs aside, their top guys have been taking advantage on the power play with some of our top penalty killers hurt (Faksa and Comeau). Their guys are really fast, and they’ve done a good job pressuring our defenders and driving play.

Dallas has showed times of sustained pressure, but they go into a long collapse shortly after gaining any momentum. The lightning aside from the poor calls, have been driving the majority of play. 

I hope all that can change tonight."
16660,2020-09-26 16:02:58,j05mwi,It all starts with winning one game. LETS FUCKING GO!!
16661,2020-09-27 00:18:38,j05mwi,Girl sounds like she has toilet paper stuck in her nose
16662,2020-09-27 01:22:46,j05mwi,"I don't give a shit what you think about goaltending, Eddie."
16663,2020-09-27 02:16:27,j05mwi,"I hope we can still win this game, even if we don’t win the series it’ll be a pin prick right through their hearts"
16664,2020-09-27 02:17:40,j05mwi,There was a reason I was hoping the islanders would beat the lightning. their goaltender wasn't aminor deity!
16665,2020-09-27 03:27:03,j05mwi,DISGUSTING OFFICIATING
16666,2020-09-27 03:27:33,j05mwi,REFS ARE BAD RIGGED CUP
16667,2020-09-27 03:33:01,j05mwi,"WE PLAYED OKAY THERE. OUR SOG WASNT HIGH BUT NOT FOR LACK OF SHOOTING. SOG DIDNT TELL THE WHOLE STORY.

NEED TO BE LESS CASUAL ABOUT CLEARING THE ZONE."
16668,2020-09-26 13:08:46,j05mwi,Woke up feeling dangerous
16669,2020-09-26 20:09:08,j05mwi,"If we lose, will you hate Tampa?"
16670,2020-09-26 21:26:49,j05mwi,Soooo would you guys place your bets on the Dallas money line? Asking for a friend.....
16671,2020-09-26 23:53:35,j05mwi,alexa play roll the bones
16672,2020-09-26 23:54:44,j05mwi,Well. Let's see how this goes
16673,2020-09-26 23:59:47,j05mwi,Better playoff pregame show: Law and Order SVU or Entertainment Tonight?
16674,2020-09-27 00:02:06,j05mwi,I am ready to cry again
16675,2020-09-27 00:04:28,j05mwi,"As we were just reminded, Bolts touched the ECC trophy, so we’re winning this!"
16676,2020-09-27 00:21:06,j05mwi,Bring back Sarah Mclachlan
16677,2020-09-27 00:22:58,j05mwi,Switching back and forth between this and the A&M game. I'm ready for pain
16678,2020-09-27 00:24:52,j05mwi,Keep up the aggression let’s go boys
16679,2020-09-27 00:25:20,j05mwi,All the shots going in on Dobby will be blocker side
16680,2020-09-27 00:28:23,j05mwi,Sigh.
16681,2020-09-27 00:28:30,j05mwi,Lol. The definition of insanity

17150,2020-09-27 04:04:39,j05mwi,"What we’re all y’all saying about Perry being worthless? He’s a dirty player, but he just got us to the next game. Dobby too, obviously."
17151,2020-09-27 04:06:12,j05mwi,"FuckinA man, FuckinA. LET'S GO STARS!!!"
17152,2020-09-26 13:52:48,j05mwi,"Proud of this team, sorry to say but Tampa is the better team and that’s okay. We’ve overcome so much this year fuck the haters, it took that stacked of a team to beat us. Our heart got us far but in the end it’s just not enough with our injuries.

I know I’m being negative prior to tonight but Dobby looks tired, Miro IS tired and has been...these guys miss home so much. We didn’t get swept, I’m okay with this. We probably won’t win a cup in a long time though, I just hope my dad lives long enough to see us lift it. He’s been a season ticket holder since day one"
17153,2020-09-26 17:09:42,j05mwi,They have to battle hard tonight. We win this it’s a 3-2 series. Easy peasy. One at a time
17154,2020-09-27 01:34:58,j05mwi,Good looking PP. No cash in so I'm not ecstatic but we have more than just a pulse. This team came to play. Anger from game 4? We have the heart and we're fighting
17155,2020-09-26 17:36:27,j05mwi,"Everyone’s talking with defeated attitudes. I know 3-1 is tough and the odds aren’t in our favor but they’ve never been and I’ve been looking at it like this 

-Last game could’ve gone 2-2 without the Benn penalty at the end
-The Islanders won game 5 after being down 3-1 and took game 6 to OT
-This team has proven they can compete in games and keep them close except for Game 3 
-It’s not over until the last whistle blows, and how fitting would it be for this team to come back 3-1 to cap off one of the most impressive playoff wins of all time"
17156,2020-09-27 02:13:27,j05mwi,Tampa is so damn good. I’m to the point where I’m not even upset.
17157,2020-09-26 15:14:47,j05mwi,I have no hope for tonight. At least one more hockey game this season is about the only thing I can look forward to.
17158,2020-09-26 16:41:03,j05mwi,"So now it’s comeau, faksa, AND Hintz?  That doesn’t feel good.  Hoped we might get Comeau back for tonight."
17159,2020-09-27 00:01:27,j05mwi,My bitches better be wearing green.
17160,2020-09-27 00:30:35,j05mwi,"Don't you love how they haven't mentioned once that we're missing like our entire PK line... maybe that's part of the reason their PP is so ""deadly"""
17161,2020-09-27 00:31:44,j05mwi,And that’s not an icing? Mah wurd.
17162,2020-09-27 00:38:12,j05mwi,Tampa player dove and they didn't call it? Where has this reffing team been?
17163,2020-09-27 00:38:25,j05mwi,Great non call on the dive attempt (should have been embellishment)
17164,2020-09-27 00:38:28,j05mwi,The boys are hungry I can feel it
17165,2020-09-27 01:13:27,j05mwi,"Seguin, Seguin, Seguin....

Boy are you still ever pretty, but now you’re slow, sloppy handling the puck, and your shot has diminished to almost nothing."
17166,2020-09-27 01:15:24,j05mwi,Man I was feeling solid but our dmen just aren't skating back right now. Get it together boys
17167,2020-09-27 01:15:47,j05mwi,They pretty much gave that one away
17168,2020-09-27 01:31:40,j05mwi,"Do we have a special teams coach? If so, can we fire them before next season?"
17169,2020-09-27 01:38:36,j05mwi,Let's go boys. Dump and chase is dumb and waste. Pass pass shoot
17170,2020-09-27 02:04:56,j05mwi,"
We only got one shot at this. One chance. One win. You know? Vomit on your mom’s spaghetti, or whatever that talking singer says."
17171,2020-09-27 02:07:03,j05mwi,"Ohhh, Pavs, damn"
17172,2020-09-27 02:08:29,j05mwi,How many fucking goals are they gonna have go in off the post Jesus. I know they're good but holy cow.
17173,2020-09-27 02:10:04,j05mwi,Let's get a quick response
17174,2020-09-27 02:11:07,j05mwi,Too many men??
17175,2020-09-27 02:25:52,j05mwi,Unfuckingbelievable how many blatant penalties they can get away with because the refs don’t want a 5-3.
17176,2020-09-27 02:42:41,j05mwi,Benn about to score the game winner y'all! Go STARS!! Win or lose this team has kicked ass this year.
17177,2020-09-27 02:47:49,j05mwi,PLEASE LET US WIN. OU LOST. UT WON. GIMME ONE MORE FOR A PERFECT WEEKEND. LETS GO!!!!!!!!!
17178,2020-09-27 02:53:33,j05mwi,COME ON DALLAS YOU GLORIOUS BASTARDS FORCE A GAME 6!!!
17179,2020-09-27 03:27:25,j05mwi,SHOOT THAT SHIT BEEN GOD DAMN IT MAN
17180,2020-09-27 02:09:21,j05mwi,"Don't celebrate too early bud, still 16 minutes for us to break your fucking heart"
17181,2020-09-27 00:29:12,j05mwi,"Bowness doesn’t deserve a contract renew. Tampa figured out Dallas’s defensive zone strategy after Game 1, and Dallas hasn’t made a single adjustment since. Tampa just has the defenseman come down to the half boards, and every single clearing attempt by Dallas turns into a turnover. That’s on the coach."
17182,2020-09-27 00:29:29,j05mwi,When did Seguin get so fucking bad at hockey?
17183,2020-09-27 00:37:14,j05mwi,"We need to interrupt their breakout and chip at their passes. They're setting up plays, they're quite evident."
17184,2020-09-27 00:37:53,j05mwi,Fucking diving bitches
17185,2020-09-27 00:38:40,j05mwi,I don't normally notice this stuff and give the players the benefit of the doubt but it really is pretty obvious how much Tampa embellishes on some of these borderline plays
17186,2020-09-27 00:46:26,j05mwi,PERRY! Hulu has a hell of a delay tonight.
17187,2020-09-27 01:11:36,j05mwi,Seguin playing his damn heart out.
17188,2020-09-27 01:24:08,j05mwi,Nice lunge that wasn't called
17189,2020-09-27 01:30:41,j05mwi,You’re seriously gonna let that tripping go ref?
17190,2020-09-27 01:30:50,j05mwi,I would love a couple more passes before we shoot 5 feet over the net.
17191,2020-09-27 02:03:54,j05mwi,Sekera = fucking WARRIOR!
17192,2020-09-27 02:04:17,j05mwi,Good energy by Caamano
17193,2020-09-27 02:04:54,j05mwi,Cogs gets more good looks than anyone on our team lol
17194,2020-09-27 02:05:03,j05mwi,"NBC codename TB deepthroat. 

Seriously how one sided can commentators be in an ""unbiased"" commentary."
17195,2020-09-27 02:08:49,j05mwi,Still plenty of time
17196,2020-09-27 02:34:51,j05mwi,Paul Miss-The-Net is funny.  Gets me very time.
17197,2020-09-27 03:16:40,j05mwi,THIS FEELS LIKE GAME 7 AGAINST THE BLUES ALL OVER AGAIN
17198,2020-09-27 03:24:01,j05mwi,This is such a poorly officiated game.
17199,2020-09-27 03:24:47,j05mwi,"I never thought NHL would be this blatantly rigged, man. What the fuck."
17200,2020-09-27 03:26:47,j05mwi,DO THE REFS GET TO SKATE WITH THE CUP TOO IF TAMPA BAY WINS?
17201,2020-09-27 03:26:58,j05mwi,WHY DID YOU NOT SHOOT THAT
17202,2020-09-27 03:27:50,j05mwi,IM SORRY IM NOT FROM AROUND HERE

17208,2020-09-27 02:51:53,j05mwi,"Every time they play that Cirelli OT goal on us from game 6 a part of me dies inside. Don't end up like us fishsticks starsbros, you got this!!"

17517,2020-09-26 15:06:31,j05mwi,"This bullcrap where they can't beat the trap in their own zone is what is killing the Stars. Scrap whatever the game plan was for last game. It's been 2-on-2 in their own zone for most of the series. Based on the faceoff wins in their own zone last game, the Stars should have DOMINATED Game 4. 

The defensemen have got to get the puck out of there. I'd take the risk of skating up center ice with the puck to the redline and dumping it in. They've got to beat this trap"

17843,2020-09-27 03:06:37,j05mwi,Yeah so we need to actually get some shots off on their end if we want to win...
17844,2020-09-27 03:17:26,j05mwi,Hi I’m new. Wondering why the stars just keep hitting the puck out in front of them as opposed to trying to keep possession I guess.
17845,2020-09-27 02:23:50,j05mwi,Oooh a PP. which we WILL waste.

17849,2020-09-26 13:15:30,j05mwi,Best thing that could happen for Stars is for Bowness to be respectful to officials during the game.  He has his opportunity to address officials privately and should use that appropriately and effectively.  Losing his shit at officials is bad for the team.  If he can't respectively and diplomatically discuss calls with officials on ice Bowness doesn't deserve to be behind the bench in any capacity.  Bowness has turned officials against Stars just like Laxdal did in Calder Cup.  None of the calls against Stars are surprising.  Bowness should have learned these lessons long ago.

We can’t afford him without moving contracts, and then even then we need to replace so many forwards the year after next.

Offers are roughly what I think we would sign our expired players and hall for. I’m sure they will cost a little more

Not even close to worth it."

18332,2020-09-27 00:49:48,j05mwi,I mean they have a good reason to hate lol
18333,2020-09-27 01:06:57,j05mwi,They want it over I think. The bubble is costing them a ton. why else would they have a back to back in a Finals series
18334,2020-09-27 01:16:00,j05mwi,They made that look super easy
18335,2020-09-27 01:26:16,j05mwi,He’s got what like 3 assists for Tampa
18336,2020-09-27 01:19:43,j05mwi,"i’m a new fan this year as well, but i believe they have to run by/to the bench to grab a replacement."
18337,2020-09-27 01:20:17,j05mwi,[deleted]
18338,2020-09-27 01:21:47,j05mwi,"You are allowed to get a replacement at any time. You have to skate to your bench to get a replacement or can take the stick of another player.

when you go to your bench you decrease the number of players on the ice for your team, so if a team is in their defensive zone they wait until the puck is out into the neutral zone to retrieve a new stick.

The only time players who break their sticks get a stick from a teammate is when its a defencemans stick that breaks, then usually a forward will give him a new one.

Goalies can continue to use a broken stick in a game until they can make it to the bench to get a new one. Or they can take a player from their own teams stick who is on the ice and use that."
18339,2020-09-27 01:22:10,j05mwi,"Not allowed to play with a broken stick. So they will just stay out and defend with the body if necessary, until they can change, or grab a new one.  


Also, no one can have more than one stick. So you sometimes see skaters give goalies their own stick, if the goalie stick is out of reach. Then they go and retrieve the goalie stick, and drop it on the ice,"
18340,2020-09-27 01:22:58,j05mwi,It’s a penalty if you play with a broken stick so they just drop it til they can get a new one
18341,2020-09-27 01:22:56,j05mwi,There was a late/mistimed jab
18342,2020-09-27 02:14:57,j05mwi,I never want to hear the word jeans or denim again

18535,2020-09-26 17:52:31,j05mwi,Agreed. From no hockey to the stars in the finals. Been a fun postseason(preseason?)
18536,2020-09-26 18:30:39,j05mwi,"I agree!  I didn’t think we had a chance against Tampa, but then Game 1 made me believe we could win this thing.  They win tonight and I’m going to be so proud!  They get beat, I’m still going to be proud that MY Dallas Stars kept beating the odds and proving doubters wrong until they just couldn’t overcome key injuries (Bishop, Faksa, Comeau, Johns, Hintz, ?Seguin...).
The fact that Dobby lead this team to the Stanley Cup Final is freaking amazing!  He’s not a 6’4” 1B.  He’s a 5’ 10” 1B/2A.  Tampa has the skill to pick the corners where Dobby isn’t...
JFKiviranta has been one of the brightest stars of the entire playoffs!  The hockey world knows his name now.  Here’s hoping he has an amazing season next year for the Stars!!
Our D have been scoring machines!  So much fun to watch them transform the post season Stars into a team that’s been a real offensive threat!  Some of the brightest moments have been courtesy of our D corp.

So win or lose, these guys are my team and I’m a proud Stars fan."
18537,2020-09-27 01:25:46,j05mwi,They still haven't bothered to learn our players' names. It's a lost cause.

18539,2020-09-26 18:02:31,j05mwi,"I think people forget that when one team is playing really well, it just makes the other team look bad. Tampa has been playing really good and we’ve been making too many damn mistakes. Penalties haven’t helped ofc but we’re fucking 7% on the power play in this series. And they’ve only had one more than us. None of this means that we suck or anything. Tampa is just *really good*"
18540,2020-09-27 00:19:10,j05mwi,LMAO WTF!!!
18541,2020-09-27 00:20:32,j05mwi,I've hated every anthem singer so far. Celina Ray has spoiled me.
18542,2020-09-27 02:18:42,j05mwi,Vasilevski is scary good.
18543,2020-09-26 22:02:16,j05mwi,"Before this series I kind of like Tampa. Never really watched them in depth but they seemed like a good team to emulate. After this though fuck them. What a big group of gutless cowards. Their answer for our physicality was to dive their way into an obscene amount of powerplays. And like someone else mentioned, they beat up on our smaller players but run back to the bench with their tails between their legs when confronted by Benn or Oleksiak.   


We have some key injuries, Khudobin has lost his magic and rest of the team hasn't done themselves any favors but I'll still say this Stanley Cup final has been an complete and utter farce. The NHL wants so bad to give the cup to Tamps and end this bubble immediately. I know the Stars are done but I hope they at least win this one game to extend it a little longer. One last fuck you to the NHL."
18544,2020-09-26 20:31:14,j05mwi,"I already hate Tampa. Like blues level hate. But this game tonite, I feel fine. It's not like we had a bad season. In my mind we already lost so if we win tonite it's a bonus. Then if we win Monday....back to heart attack time,, anxiety all day,, etc.. so in a way I feel kinda good, going in to this one with no expectations. I mean,, we are down so many players,, like realistically,, the chances of us winning are about the same as a snowball in hell."
18545,2020-09-26 20:59:10,j05mwi,"Outside of Maroon, no. I've liked Tampa a lot in the ""Stamkos"" era, they're fun to watch. The fanbase is super arrogant though, but then we probably would be too if we were on the cusp of winning the Cup."
18546,2020-09-26 20:10:59,j05mwi,"Nah. Maroon, sure. But other than a few sold calls (which to their credit is working for them) they haven’t done anything to piss me off. I will hate Tuch until my dying day though"
18547,2020-09-26 20:29:47,j05mwi,"I already hate them. The amount of diving has been insane and not just the ones that have been called for them btw, there’s been a fair few dives they didn’t get the call on. The amount of after whistle scrums they start against our smaller players but never larger players is telling. Kucherov has been an asshole this entire playoffs and is the head diver. I’ve hated Maroon for years already.

Their fans tho I kinda like. I’ve been obnoxious to them when we’re losing and instead of them crying about it they give me deserved and relevant shit back. What cracks me up is the Avs fans celebrating us losing as their own victory and trying to “own” us in r/hockey threads"
18548,2020-09-26 21:05:53,j05mwi,No I won’t hate them. Not like I do the blues.
18549,2020-09-26 20:40:13,j05mwi,"Nah, not a fan of their fanbase for how arrogant they’ve been to the point of mocking other fans for simply believing in their own team though. But I doubt I’ll hate the franchise itself.

Colorado fans though...fuck that franchise now. I actually liked the Avs despite being divisional rivals and wouldn’t mind seeing them win but after dealing with that salty ass fanbase all playoffs I hope MacKinnon never wins the Cup unless he leaves Colorado."
18550,2020-09-26 21:42:34,j05mwi,"No, nothing Like St Louis or even pisscats."
18551,2020-09-26 20:13:16,j05mwi,"Of course, this is how rivalries are born. Makes the sport interesting."

18610,2020-09-26 13:58:03,j05mwi,I don't think they're the better team. I'm in the same boat as you are but with my mom. I'm just glad she got to see her team in the SCF.
18611,2020-09-26 14:02:04,j05mwi,"Yeah when the lightning skated in shortly before winning, I was staring at how hard Anton was cheating to the short side (similar to Stamkos goal) as there was so much room far side. I hate to say it, but he has been pretty bad this final.

We just saw the worst game Vasilevskiy will have and Dallas still blew it."

18613,2020-09-26 14:44:44,j05mwi,"I agree that tampa is the better team, so I can handle losing to them.

What I can't handle however is referees deciding a championship, and that's exactly what happened last night and has been going on throughout the series. 

All the sudden physical play is a no no, and since I've already had my love of one sport killed by a screw job (2006) I'm not sticking around for it to happen again.

I'm going to take time to evaluate, but this may have been the last hockey game I ever watch, i will not support the NHL if they continue to allow things like this."
18614,2020-09-26 17:38:10,j05mwi,We’re all hoping for the best of course but a team has literally never won the Stanley Cup after being down 3-1 and having to win an elimination game as the second game of a back-to-back. I’d say the defeatist takes are realistic.
18615,2020-09-27 02:14:46,j05mwi,"Tampa deserves this Cup as much as anyone else. They fought like hell to make it here, and I wouldn’t fault them for winning."
18616,2020-09-27 02:14:13,j05mwi,It's a 2-1 game and there's more than 10min left. Cool your jets with that talk.
18617,2020-09-27 02:15:46,j05mwi,"They are really really good. But you know what, we're hanging with them even though we're missing like half our team at this point. Whatever happens, I'm taking a lot of optimism about the future of our team from this."

We are definitely very superstitious, but I think it's because it makes it easier to cope when things go wrong. Hopefully dallas wins and I can just eat shit."

19002,2020-09-26 18:18:40,j05mwi,They won and they were still complaining about the refs...
19003,2020-09-27 01:46:37,j05mwi,"They are cherry picking in the middle

The Blues used to do this to us all the time with Tarasenko"
19004,2020-09-27 01:48:57,j05mwi,"So when they are in our zone or headed for it we tend to kind of collapse down, almost looks like we're on PK. When we have the puck, their forwards are cheating high looking to pick off the puck or get sprung for a breakaway because they don't think we're going to be able to do anything. Or at least they think the chance of giving up a score to us by doing that  is outweighed by their likelihood of getting space with the puck and scoring."
19005,2020-09-27 02:50:48,j05mwi,Hahaha beautifully said m8
19006,2020-09-27 02:24:08,j05mwi,"And that's what sucks about all this. Someone said in the PGT last night that these refs have neutered the Stars by calling every act of physical dominance. Now they are either gun shy for fear of drawing a penalty, or they do something - and draw a penalty. A prime example was last night in OT. Benn has made that move 100 times this post-season. 

It's just all sucks."
19007,2020-09-27 02:26:44,j05mwi,"You can really tell they’re scared to get aggressive with them tonight in fear of getting a bullshit penalty.

19009,2020-09-26 13:57:02,j05mwi,"While Khudobin didn't play perfectly last night, it definitely wasn't his fault in my opinion. We had many chances but squandered them.

&#x200B;

1. We gave them too much time and space with a pathetic forecheck that let them set up a breakaway goal.
2. We didn't capitalize on a 4 on 3 PP in OT.
3. We got lazy defensively late in the 2nd and 3rd period which led to goals in the last 2 minutes of the game.

Out of all the goals last night, I really think there was just that one weak goal Dobby let in that was his fault."
19010,2020-09-26 14:04:59,j05mwi,"Not sure why you got downvoted. I love Khudobin, but he is taking bad angles that are costing us and stick side is getting massacred right now."

19050,2020-09-27 02:21:45,j05mwi,Yeah there’s only been one game where we looked truly outmatched. We’re a couple of undisciplined penalties away from possibly being the ones up 3-1. Gotta be proud of that.

19057,2020-09-27 00:32:29,j05mwi,It’s going into four straight games of watching Dallas make tape-to-tape passes back to the Tampa defense inside the blue line. They just can’t adjust.
19058,2020-09-27 00:34:23,j05mwi,"Yes missing comeau and Faksa hurts the PK, but Dallas continues to play this passive PK scheme that is getting torched. Tampa is too good to let them have time. The PKers should be applying pressure constantly."

19144,2020-09-26 14:18:16,j05mwi,The complaining about the refs isn’t the parallel I’m seeing. (It’s not new.) It’s the calling the other guys “divers” after every fucking call.

Syncing up the 2 audios from across the Atlantic using a questionable VPN whilst watching live on UK TV which for some reason seems to put it's own delays into the live broadcast at every as break is just... Too much effort to put in every ten minutes. 

Nevermind any unforseen extra adjustments that are needed when NHL.tv craps out!"

Don’t get me wrong, I hope Hintz is OK and fit to play.  I just see Faksa & Comeau as bigger losses."
19194,2020-09-27 02:16:53,j05mwi,"Dude I'd have a little faith if Benn and Seguin had more than 3 points between them. This is just a better team than we are. Khudobin had an amazing game 1, Vasilevskiy has been better every game since. They just don't have what it takes."

19219,2020-09-27 01:36:46,j05mwi,How is it that a Dallas fan is worse than Lightning fans trolling our threads?
19220,2020-09-27 01:37:09,j05mwi,How can this be a choke when they are playing a better team?

19222,2020-09-27 01:37:01,j05mwi,"guess you can’t support any other teams ever, even from another country too😂"

19239,2020-09-27 00:54:48,j05mwi,Yeah. But people on this talk so much shit haha they don’t realize he’s a huge asset to this team.

19249,2020-09-26 16:45:28,j05mwi,It's honestly just one of those things that some athletes have. There's a lot of wear and tear competing at that level and some guys bodies just can't handle the strain as well as others
19250,2020-09-26 16:07:02,j05mwi,"Heck yeah man, I am all in.  Never leave a hockey game and never give up on a series.  To be honest, this is EXACTLY how the Stars would win the cup."
19251,2020-09-26 17:25:23,j05mwi,">	You're right, this team has never won 3 games straight.

Not saying I have a ton of hope but this team just won 3 straight last round against Vegas."
19252,2020-09-26 19:24:34,j05mwi,I want to downvote this so badly.

19256,2020-09-26 13:39:11,j05mwi,"There's video somewhere.  This guy and his buddy, behind Blues, were huffing something.  Lots of rags under seats.  Polak goes in the box for weak penalty.  Guy tosses beer before usher could get to him.  Hits players, Ott, etc.  post the video if you find it.  Might be in this sub.  If not, r/hockey."

So glad i decided to give Hockey a shot at the start of this season. it’s become my favorite sport, i just have to learn how to follow the puck on TV, the game is so damn fast."

19268,2020-09-26 13:52:20,j05mwi,That is so disappointing. I remeber a fan got kicked out of the NSH series but didn't remember the Blues.
19269,2020-09-27 02:15:49,j05mwi,"Take your downvotes for your stupid question and being too retarded to read the room and fuck off, cunt."
19270,2020-09-27 01:40:03,j05mwi,that contradicts your bandwagon comment from earlier buddy
19271,2020-09-27 01:40:58,j05mwi,"That's not a reason at all. Using your logic, since your from Dallas, you should be a Mavericks fan, not a Nuggets fan."

19284,2020-09-27 01:45:20,j05mwi,"Try telling that to our Starssis in Australia, u/misrabelle that you fucker. Just because I don't live as close to Dallas as you do, doesn't give you ANY right to call me or any of the Starsfam ""fake fans""

We've all been here from 1-7-1 to now. We've seen the best and the worst of OUR team. Now get the fuck out of here before you say something else stupid."

19287,2020-09-27 02:26:33,j05mwi,"Yeah, that was a ridiculous statement.   
If I could be bothered arguing with such bullshit, I'd point out that I bet OP doesn't attend every game at AAC, despite living in Dallas, and it not being all that much effort.     
Yet I got on a plane and came over from Australia to watch our boys live...and \*everyone\* I met along the way was friendly and welcoming, because we're all on the same side.  


It's not just me, there are other Aussies here, and plenty of Euro Starsfam, who are awake at ridiculous o'clock in the morning to support the team. It's not easy or convenient for us to be Stars fans, but we do it anyway.   


Op; You don't get to gatekeep. Proximity means nothing, our love for the team (and our fellow Starsfam), transcends geography."

Am I just not supposed to root for an NHL team because I don't live in Dallas? What if I move to Dallas? Will I then have your *permission* to root for The Stars?"

That was 100% a trip. Also, there's just no legal way to take someone down when they're half a stride in front of you. That was 100% a penalty, and the commentators completely fucked up their analysis.  
  
Bottom line is the refs tried everything they could to give Dallas a chance with that embellishment which, as a person with testicles, is up there on the list of worst calls I've ever seen, and Dallas couldn't capitalize.

19485,2020-09-26 03:26:24,izy9x7,"Genuinely one of the worst officiated games I have ever seen. That last call was a complete makeup call for the embellishment penalty but I'll take it. Just win baby!

Edit: NVM saw it from a much clearer angle than the broadcast. Clear hold"
19486,2020-09-26 03:26:31,izy9x7,"Glad to see Tampa win, but what a shitty call for the win. If that penalty hadn’t been called, we’d probably still be watching."
19487,2020-09-26 03:27:05,izy9x7,"C'mon Dallas, rally up the boys and get this series back on track. Can't stand seeing Tampa winning."
19488,2020-09-26 03:31:11,izy9x7,"What a shame, Dallas fought hard.

I think the back to back game favors Tampa because Dallas have older players in big roles and it can take longer for them to recover."
19489,2020-09-26 03:35:34,izy9x7,"Didn't feel like that was Dallas' best. But also felt like it may have been the best we have. Hoping we bounce back but I'm concerned given out record in back to backs. 

Also was hoping at 2-2 we could consider resting Dobby but don't think that happens now."
19490,2020-09-26 06:12:42,izy9x7,Fuck the Stars close it out Tampa you deserve it

19497,2020-09-26 03:23:45,izy9x7,Seems like Dobby has turned into a pumpkin. However unfortunately
19498,2020-09-26 03:24:50,izy9x7,"Pretty shitty call on Benn imo, especially in overtime. 2 minutes for being strong"

19500,2020-09-26 03:24:49,izy9x7,Welp. Guess the refs are determined to give the cup to the bolts.

19502,2020-09-26 04:00:52,izy9x7,"I mean like if you call that by the book it’s a hold but in playoffs you don’t call that, the fact the back ref was so confident in thinking it was a slew foot is brutal you gotta be 100% on calls"
19503,2020-09-26 03:37:40,izy9x7,"Say what you want that Dallas shouldn't have been in that position or a million other things about our PP not capitalizing and I won't deny it. Seriously though, you can't make calls like that in OT without being absolutely sure it is deserved when they missed blatant trips on Tampa and blatant high sticks from Dallas in that game. It's fucking ridiculous to have a game end like that. It is unfair to Dallas and it cheapens the win for Tampa. Fucking sickening and the league won't say a damn word either..."

19506,2020-09-26 03:26:19,izy9x7,Imagine thinking people watch hockey for it to be decided by refs night in and night out. Swallow your whistles or have some fucking consistency you cunts

Almost like you’re ready to dig in and defend your potential title in a series with the worst officiating I’ve ever seen. Tampa most likely would have pulled this out in an even series, but now we’ll never know. NHL officiating is a joke that needs to get under control because nobody likes watching this shit. But just keep wondering why ratings keep tanking. The product is bullshit and this isn’t what hockey should be offering to the sports world if it wants to grow."

19566,2020-09-26 06:36:48,izy9x7,I honestly wonder what the effect the bubble has on them is. We’ve heard all this talk about players struggling mentally but at least they’re making a ton of money and have a goal of winning the cup.

19611,2020-09-26 03:42:24,izy9x7,"Yeah my dad said he looked shaky all game, and it looked like he had a tough time controlling rebounds all game, something that was a main reason that Dallas took game 1."
19612,2020-09-26 05:13:20,izy9x7,"If only the team in front of him wasn't leaving him out to dry multiple times per period.

I feel like we're falling apart at the end here, which I guess is a serious factor of playoff hockey."
19613,2020-09-26 03:33:55,izy9x7,"Because if Benn wasn't the puck carrier then it's interference on Johnson.  Since he was the puck carrier, his ""penalty"" is not falling down and pushing the other guy off when there was contact in open ice."
19614,2020-09-26 03:49:13,izy9x7,So why is Johnson allowed to raise his stick and hold off Benn with it? Isn’t this hooking?
19615,2020-09-26 03:26:56,izy9x7,I appreciate your dedication to this cause.

19619,2020-09-26 03:29:24,izy9x7,Wow. Americans get so many commercials. I feel like I see the same 5'ish commercials for an entire games length.
19620,2020-09-26 03:32:16,izy9x7,"I definitely have different commercials than you...

There were at least 10 Old Navy commercials for me.

I don’t know why the app repeats the same handful of ads instead of doing the same thing the regular broadcast does."
19621,2020-09-26 03:53:05,izy9x7,Been watching on NBC sports app and keep getting this annoying Old Navy commerical almost every break
19622,2020-09-26 04:32:51,izy9x7,I feel like I’ve seen that navy federal credit union commercial a million times. I miss seeing the gieco commercial with Idina Menzel.. At first I hated it but now I think I’m in love with her.

19624,2020-09-26 03:59:23,izy9x7,"How does a human being have the strength to lift up another person's leg with one hand on his stick? Johnson lost his balance preventing Benn from getting to the puck, and Benn's stick was underneath his leg, but there's no way Benn LIFTED his leg up."
19625,2020-09-26 03:24:58,izy9x7,Agreed
19626,2020-09-26 07:54:16,izy9x7,ppl acting like the lightning shouldn't have instead had a 5 minute major penalty for spearing on perry lol
19627,2020-09-26 03:31:32,izy9x7,Yeah. Dude just got out muscled and the refs made another terrible call.
19628,2020-09-26 04:51:34,izy9x7,@
19629,2020-09-26 03:38:33,izy9x7,"The Benn penalty was a penalty...I have no idea why people are arguing that one. Watch the replay. Stick under his knee, pulls his foot out from under him while pulling back on the top. Hold and a trip combined."
19630,2020-09-26 03:31:01,izy9x7,"Both can be bad

I'll admit, the Perry one was worse (inexcusable really)

But both were bad"
19631,2020-09-26 03:30:45,izy9x7,Does one bad call me they can’t complain about the one that went against them? Like do you think before typing shit out?
19632,2020-09-26 03:29:35,izy9x7,Yep. That’s the first call that went our way all playoffs. Then refs immediately had to even that up
19633,2020-09-26 03:44:11,izy9x7,They need to have Tampa's announce team on one channel and Dallas' on another and their national guys on the main. I would so love to hear Rick calling these games and go to Andy for added commentary.

19637,2020-09-26 03:58:51,izy9x7,Except it's both teams fans agreeing that the refs are fucking dogshit.
19638,2020-09-26 05:36:26,izy9x7,We won and I'll bitch about em. Gotta leave it up to fucking refbot 9000 or something
19639,2020-09-26 03:34:16,izy9x7,Hate to break it to you but the refs have been horrible both ways all series. It’s the Stanley Cup let the boys play alittle.
19640,2020-09-26 03:30:37,izy9x7,I'm so bitter
19641,2020-09-26 03:26:22,izy9x7,Get the wheelbarrow
19642,2020-09-26 03:28:53,izy9x7,I got the tequila
19643,2020-09-26 03:28:49,izy9x7,Yup
19644,2020-09-26 03:34:00,izy9x7,Lowkey? I agree on the Corey Perry thing. I don’t like the way he plays. I’m relatively new to hockey but he definitely plays dirty.
19645,2020-09-26 03:25:12,izy9x7,One more game
19646,2020-09-26 03:34:10,izy9x7,Explain your theory
19647,2020-09-26 03:42:16,izy9x7,The day they can post those will be so sweet indeed.
19648,2020-09-26 04:32:14,izy9x7,If they don't post that I'm going to be beyond disappointed
19649,2020-09-26 03:26:47,izy9x7,First time?
19650,2020-09-26 03:26:50,izy9x7,"Tampa is ridiculously good. I don’t even know how they could improve. 

And they’re doing all this without one of the best players in the league..."
19651,2020-09-26 03:31:14,izy9x7,The Lightning are notorious for never losing 3 straight games in the playoffs
19652,2020-09-26 03:38:07,izy9x7,"Been following Stars and cheering for them more coz East > West and also time difference but I did watch the tail end of Lightening Islanders series. Thought they had a good chance but too many injuries and inconsistencies. Meanwhile Stars cut thru GK like hot knife and butter. 

Well look at us now."
19653,2020-09-26 06:34:23,izy9x7,When have teams ever blown 3-1 leads before
19654,2020-09-26 03:30:57,izy9x7,This 100%
19655,2020-09-26 03:36:00,izy9x7,"Agreed, missed and bullshit makeup calls both ways"
19656,2020-09-26 03:53:08,izy9x7,"Yeah that was a hard one. Definitely was tripping, Johnson lost his stick between Hintz leg. Hope he’s okay."
19657,2020-09-26 03:52:17,izy9x7,Yeah that was rough.
19658,2020-09-26 03:56:48,izy9x7,As well as you should be. Dogshit officiating and a clear penalty.
19659,2020-09-26 05:36:56,izy9x7,Yeah I see that called almost every other time tbh
19660,2020-09-26 04:17:38,izy9x7,"I agree. That was such a fast-paced, stressful, high scoring game."
19661,2020-09-26 03:27:10,izy9x7,Because its a hard and thankless job
19662,2020-09-26 03:44:28,izy9x7,Flair up buddy
19663,2020-09-26 03:28:11,izy9x7,"I'm confused on why that shouldn't have been a penalty? He definitely uses his free arm to throw him back off balance, even if not a trip it's definitely a hold or something.

Maybe slightly weak for a playoff OT but imo that is a penalty..."
19664,2020-09-26 03:28:01,izy9x7,And the embellishment call sucked also.
19665,2020-09-26 03:26:46,izy9x7,Alright I clearly need to see that again because I could have sworn Benn got his stick between the dude's legs but everyone's bitching about the call
19666,2020-09-26 03:26:34,izy9x7,But it was a hold? Free hand has been called all game.
19667,2020-09-26 03:29:54,izy9x7,"Missed two highsticks that the Stars scored off sucked too.

Refs have been shit on both sides."
19668,2020-09-26 03:26:58,izy9x7,It was a cascade of bad the last 10 or so minutes of game time
19669,2020-09-26 05:43:59,izy9x7,Was the right call

19680,2020-09-26 03:53:17,izy9x7,No offense z bit this is the most delusional thing here. Why on earth would you think the league would change anything about the officiating? They never do. Never. They occasionally slightly modify a rule. No red ever gets punished with anything more than a little longer summer
19681,2020-09-26 03:31:41,izy9x7,But you lost.
19682,2020-09-26 03:25:01,izy9x7,For what?

19686,2020-09-26 04:11:15,izy9x7,Agree
19687,2020-09-26 03:46:37,izy9x7,Next game refs call nothing and we have a better chance.
19688,2020-09-26 05:46:04,izy9x7,Wasn't  a makeup. Was the right call
19689,2020-09-26 03:34:30,izy9x7,"There's no ""but"". Officiate the game correctly or gtfo."
19690,2020-09-26 04:14:54,izy9x7,Exactly
19691,2020-09-26 03:24:48,izy9x7,It was a lot more of a penalty than the one on Point.
19692,2020-09-26 03:25:49,izy9x7,I hope everyone saying this would've said the same if the Stars scored on the 4 on 4
19693,2020-09-26 03:36:39,izy9x7,All of you guys parroting the commentators really must not know what a penalty is. Wasn't a trip but a blatant hold. Get over it. Especially because you had a freebie on that embellishment.
19694,2020-09-26 05:17:43,izy9x7,Imagine not scoring on a 4 on 3
19695,2020-09-26 03:24:12,izy9x7,Right? Couldn’t imagine losing on that embellishment
19696,2020-09-26 03:26:29,izy9x7,"There’s a sub for that

r/goldenknights"
19697,2020-09-26 03:30:24,izy9x7,"Yeah, like the two highsticks they replayed clear as day and the Stars scored on both... refs sucked both ways."
19698,2020-09-26 03:25:43,izy9x7,Yeah it's a good thing we didn't lose on the embellishment. Right team won!!
19699,2020-09-26 03:24:23,izy9x7,"That was a trip, obvious call"
19700,2020-09-26 03:26:52,izy9x7,Why imagine it when you’ve lived it?🙃🙃🙃🙃
19701,2020-09-26 03:32:45,izy9x7,I don't have to. It actually happened.
19702,2020-09-26 03:46:01,izy9x7,How?
19703,2020-09-26 03:47:57,izy9x7,But it was a penalty?
19704,2020-09-26 03:41:58,izy9x7,I don't understand how people are saying Benn's penalty is a bad call. He clearly grabs Johnny's stick and pulls him down. What do you see that makes you say it's a bad call?
19705,2020-09-26 03:38:00,izy9x7,Vasy has played every game so far - I'd say it's a wash
19706,2020-09-26 05:44:59,izy9x7,That was a good call
19707,2020-09-26 03:25:49,izy9x7,But that embellishment..
19708,2020-09-26 03:45:12,izy9x7,"The one where Benn grabs the guys with his free hand and hauls him down? Lol. 

You’re always crying about refs."
19709,2020-09-26 04:09:54,izy9x7,If the trash call against Point ended the game would you have the sentiment?
19710,2020-09-26 04:00:54,izy9x7,You guys could’ve had it with your 4v3
19711,2020-09-26 05:45:25,izy9x7,Was a good call
19712,2020-09-26 03:30:40,izy9x7,"Yeah, i cant believe Stars scored on two missed highsticks."
19713,2020-09-26 03:26:54,izy9x7,So was the embellishment on Point. We should have had a power play heading into overtime. Not our fault you couldn't win it when you had a bullshit 4 on 3.
19714,2020-09-26 03:34:01,izy9x7,"It wasn't a trip, but it was holding. Who cares what you call it, Benn absolutely earned those two PIMs."
19715,2020-09-26 03:28:07,izy9x7,Except it did.
19716,2020-09-26 03:25:51,izy9x7,Cry more Dead Wings

19719,2020-09-26 04:20:18,izy9x7,It was a penalty
19720,2020-09-26 03:31:20,izy9x7,Ok what about 2015?
19721,2020-09-26 03:32:58,izy9x7,What about 2015?
19722,2020-09-26 03:28:51,izy9x7,"Doubtful, it's silly how consistently even power play opportunities are in the playoffs"
19723,2020-09-26 03:29:11,izy9x7,haha from across enemy lines I can still agree how the fuck does a guy embellish getting hit in the nuts? what does any non-eunuch male automatically do when hit hard in the junk??
19724,2020-09-26 03:26:55,izy9x7,There are only 4 people in the world who thought Point was embellishing but they were all wearing stripes on Edmonton ice.
19725,2020-09-26 03:28:06,izy9x7,"Why wasn't he in pain, like, 2 seconds afterwards?"
19726,2020-09-26 03:26:31,izy9x7,The embellishment call that started the OT 4 on 4 rather than TB up a man before a penalty getting called that puts Dallas up 4:3 then 5:4 was a bullshit sequence too. Dallas had their chance to end this off a bad call.
19727,2020-09-26 04:21:32,izy9x7,The Stars had 4v3 and 5v4 in overtime. The deserving team won dude
19728,2020-09-26 06:06:48,izy9x7,Neutral fan with an honest take. Just downvote him Tampa fans.
19729,2020-09-26 03:44:07,izy9x7,It being a hold instead of a slewfoot does not negate the fact that it was a penalty.

19731,2020-09-26 03:26:52,izy9x7,Don't act like there wasn't terrible calls both ways tonight.
19732,2020-09-26 03:36:08,izy9x7,It was a trip but it wasn’t intentional or TyJo being dirty. Very sorry your player is injured and I hope he can come back tomorrow.
19733,2020-09-26 03:34:32,izy9x7,Bye! Hope you enjoy the fights!
19734,2020-09-26 03:28:10,izy9x7,Why not both?
19735,2020-09-26 04:22:34,izy9x7,I wonder what happened in Game 5 in our series
19736,2020-09-26 03:49:37,izy9x7,Bullshit. The league has a thing against Tampa. Never a stadium/classic bid. Rarely focused on website. NBC disses us constantly.
19737,2020-09-26 04:06:31,izy9x7,"I mean, we gave you last year. Let us have this one!"
19738,2020-09-26 03:41:30,izy9x7,Not over yet!
19739,2020-09-26 04:23:38,izy9x7,"If only you had a 4 on 3 PP and multiple PP opportunities to score on, oh wait"
19740,2020-09-26 03:34:32,izy9x7,That would be great because the lightning would have had two power play in the last 20 minutes or so of the game instead of one.
19741,2020-09-26 03:40:44,izy9x7,Huh?
19742,2020-09-26 03:30:48,izy9x7,I imagine it would be like 2010 chicago
19743,2020-09-26 03:31:45,izy9x7,yet they done more than Barzal ;)
19744,2020-09-26 05:35:07,izy9x7,I agree.  That embellishment call was atrocious.  Glad you see that too.
19745,2020-09-26 03:31:31,izy9x7,Oh fuck off.
19746,2020-09-26 05:46:28,izy9x7,Is that you Marchy?
19747,2020-09-26 03:30:39,izy9x7,“Embellishment”
19748,2020-09-26 07:57:16,izy9x7,"take a stick anywhere above the knee and i guarantee you flinch to protect your nuts.  take a stick above the knee near the nuts while you're on ice and sprinting, and you're 100% going to flinch and fall."
19749,2020-09-26 05:15:29,izy9x7,I don't think that was even going in lmao
19750,2020-09-26 08:21:22,izy9x7,"Saves a goal, but lost 2 on the play. LOL!"
19751,2020-09-26 08:06:44,izy9x7,OMFG THIS IS GLORIOUS. Any update on that dude?
19752,2020-09-26 05:00:20,izy9x7,Avoiding the NFL on Sunday. Cup Final would get crappy ratings in the States if going head to head with Sunday Night Football.
19753,2020-09-26 03:35:42,izy9x7,"Well if the Stars bros want a consolation, the last time a Stanley cup finals series had a back to back in it, the cup winners came back from down 2 games to win it...

Don’t ask who that team was by the way that information is redacted"
19754,2020-09-26 03:37:24,izy9x7,They had to.  They want free agency by Oct 1 and they couldn't play Sunday because of contract issues.
19755,2020-09-26 06:40:21,izy9x7,Apparently the players agreed to it. They want out of the bubble faster
19756,2020-09-26 12:27:44,izy9x7,"You might be joking, but it's like when the caps got past Pittsburgh in 18. This team is on a fucking mission"

19762,2020-09-26 13:33:08,izy9x7,"It was pointed, not johnson"
19763,2020-09-26 03:24:36,izy9x7,We showed up tonight for more than just one period! And then this.
19764,2020-09-26 03:28:24,izy9x7,Totally fair
19765,2020-09-26 03:33:47,izy9x7,I feel for everyone except for Perry.
19766,2020-09-26 04:09:15,izy9x7,I feel for Pavs.
19767,2020-09-26 03:26:52,izy9x7,"They showed it on CBC and I only saw it in slow motion, but it looked like a hold to me. Took his hand off his stick to grab him."
19768,2020-09-26 03:26:46,izy9x7,"It was still holding, not sure what all the fuss was about. Olczyk is so annoying sometimes"
19769,2020-09-26 03:29:53,izy9x7,"https://twitter.com/thereplayguy/status/1309694416509169665?s=21

Not sure what everyone in this thread is on about, it was a pretty clear penalty to me and definitely slewfoot-ey since he used his stick to take out Johnson’s legs while pushing his upper body back"
19770,2020-09-26 03:41:50,izy9x7,"I thought it was a penalty when they first showed it, I think in real time it feels like more of a hockey battle that you’d rather they just leave uncalled, on replay it looks like a hold"
19771,2020-09-26 03:28:10,izy9x7,"Definitely was a hold. Wasn’t a slew foot, but that’s still a holding call."
19772,2020-09-26 03:38:32,izy9x7,Yeah that's 100% a penalty.  He grabs his hand/stick and pulls back while his stick lifts the leg.  It's pretty damn close to a slewfoot.
19773,2020-09-26 03:32:47,izy9x7,FYI that ain't the link buddy that's the Twitter home
19774,2020-09-26 03:27:20,izy9x7,"Holding, stick up between the legs...they called the wrong thing but it was something lol."
19775,2020-09-26 03:25:25,izy9x7,"Yes, they showed the replay several times during the broadcast lol. Not even close to a slewfoot"
19776,2020-09-26 03:27:08,izy9x7,It was obviously a hold. Called a slew foot. A penalty either way
19777,2020-09-26 03:25:44,izy9x7,Looked to me like Benn's stick took Johnson's leg out from under him.
19778,2020-09-26 03:26:11,izy9x7,Definitely not a slew foot. It was a hockey battle. No call should have been made.
19779,2020-09-26 03:25:34,izy9x7,"It wasn't even close, even the booth guys were talking about it"
19780,2020-09-26 12:55:10,izy9x7,"It also applies to Bogosian, Rutta, and Schenn"
19781,2020-09-26 04:30:24,izy9x7,Doc is a fucking moron.  He cannot leave his own bias out of it.  Should be fired for that alone
19782,2020-09-26 05:08:14,izy9x7,"It was 2 players jostling for position trying to get to the puck who got tangled up with one of them going down.  Shit call to make in OT of the Finals and why I think he called it ""just a hockey play""."
19783,2020-09-26 03:35:29,izy9x7,"Either way, it was still absolutely a penalty. Doesn't really matter what they called it as in the end in my mind. Saw it in full speed now and I can see why they called it a trip, but I think it should have been a holding call personally."
19784,2020-09-26 04:33:52,izy9x7,We gotchu
19785,2020-09-26 05:06:44,izy9x7,"You misspelled ""farm team""."
19786,2020-09-26 07:53:06,izy9x7,Can't wait til a few years from now when we get to watch panarin in the blue and white
19787,2020-09-26 09:22:34,izy9x7,*NO*
19788,2020-09-26 08:41:42,izy9x7,the fix was in! losing that game 1-0 was heartbreaking
19789,2020-09-26 04:00:48,izy9x7,"officiating was awful for both sides, bolts were just the ones to capitalize"
19790,2020-09-26 04:12:40,izy9x7,"Another good point. Stars failed to execute, that's the story."
19791,2020-09-26 03:53:33,izy9x7,"We had so many PP chances and we didn't cash in, that's the boys' fault"
19792,2020-09-26 03:36:09,izy9x7,Nah we had a 2-0 lead. Got to hang on to those. Our penalty kill was shit too. But yes that final call was unforgivable
19793,2020-09-26 05:24:02,izy9x7,Cheers
19794,2020-09-26 04:22:36,izy9x7,Not even close to being a worse call. Do you have two eyes?
19795,2020-09-26 09:09:48,izy9x7,"Umm I was rooting for the Stars, lost my mind on that embellishment call, but that Benn call was clearly a penalty."
19796,2020-09-26 03:57:44,izy9x7,"Eddie O might be the worst of all of them. Go bet on horses, you fuck."
19797,2020-09-26 16:02:39,izy9x7,Tampa seems to be able to punish him for playing further out of his net where Vegas didn’t. And he seems to struggle when he is deeper in net.
19798,2020-09-26 03:36:13,izy9x7,"neither of them were the puck carrier though. the puck isn't in Jamie Benn's possession, and you can also see Sergachev reaching out and grabbing the puck as it floated away from Johnson and Benn. it was a loose puck and Benn's stick was lifting up Johnson's leg. Refs called it a slew foot and no matter how much Eddie Olczyk doesn't like it, i'd say that was a slew foot. he took out Johnson's feet from under him and made him fall backwards. idk, seemed like a clear penalty to me"
19799,2020-09-26 03:51:50,izy9x7,"because he didn't hook him, he tried to block his stick while they were both chasing after a loose puck. that's the incidental contact/""hockey play"" that Eddie Olczyk should've been referring to. They're theoretically trying to get inside position to a loose puck, by putting their stick in front of the other player's. the penalty was the slew foot + grabbing Johnson's arm and bringing him backwards while pushing his own stick up on Johnson's leg"
19800,2020-09-26 03:33:46,izy9x7,I go off my TV and not the App.
19801,2020-09-26 05:34:13,izy9x7,"I go off streams. ""God damn, another stupid commercial with just a boring skate slowly going over fog"""
19802,2020-09-26 04:00:15,izy9x7,"If you watch it again, Benn uses his own leg as leverage for the stick"
19803,2020-09-26 04:03:03,izy9x7,"Leverage. It's very clear here:

https://twitter.com/thereplayguy/status/1309694416509169665?s=21"
19804,2020-09-26 13:30:53,izy9x7,"Also looks like knee contributes by going into Johnson's thigh. Combo of stick and knee but stick most I think.

Also pulling him back makes it even easier for his leg to come for the ice like it did"
19805,2020-09-26 03:34:37,izy9x7,"Apparently it was tripping, I assumed it was holding which I think is correct"
19806,2020-09-26 05:05:42,izy9x7,How dare you.
19807,2020-09-26 03:39:40,izy9x7,oh yea it’s a penalty 100% it’s just not a tripping one
19808,2020-09-26 03:42:19,izy9x7,Tampa guy initiated a battle for position and lost it. [He was leaning into benn](https://i.imgur.com/y1cUglO.png) with all he had. Hardly Benns fault for standing his ground
19809,2020-09-26 03:35:29,izy9x7,idk about that you guys have been horrible when it comes to staying disciplined. in every game but game 2 you guys had less penalties than Tampa (game 2 was tied). this is just a stupid take
19810,2020-09-26 03:45:39,izy9x7,NBCS needs to clear house with this crew.  It's atrocious.
19811,2020-09-26 05:37:48,izy9x7,🤝🤝
19812,2020-09-26 03:43:37,izy9x7,"All fanbases of every sport is ""the refs lost us the game""

If Dallas lost that Benn penalty would have been ignored. Dont even try to convince me otherwise cus its true. Every fanbase in the NHL blames the refs for a good chunk of their games and its dumb

Im sorry, and I know Dallas fans are hurt, but blame something thats not the refs."
19813,2020-09-26 03:35:04,izy9x7,🚚 is my dump truck okay?
19814,2020-09-26 03:38:16,izy9x7,"Well. If they score less in overtime than the others, it really doesn’t help"
19815,2020-09-26 03:28:45,izy9x7,"Yeah, I mean no way a great team like the Bolts lose 3 straight.

Imagine if they lost 4 straight. That could never happen. Right?


...right?  :("
19816,2020-09-26 03:30:53,izy9x7,Yeah it's insane that they're this dominant without him. Bogosian hasn't even played since game one and they still look incredible.
19817,2020-09-26 03:39:18,izy9x7,Stamkos would be a step up
19818,2020-09-26 03:31:22,izy9x7,"They're going to lose a lot of depth this offseason, but I think you trade all that to be in the position they are in now"
19819,2020-09-26 04:44:34,izy9x7,"Biggest weaknesses for discussions sake: we rarely get more than 40% of faceoffs, and we turn over the puck I'm our zone more than other teams, esp in these playoffs"
19820,2020-09-26 04:30:12,izy9x7,"Same here. I’m not super mad at Johnson (shit happens), but he shoulda drawn a penalty, and that’s the refs fault."
19821,2020-09-26 05:09:18,izy9x7,Better question then: why does the NHL put their refs in such a hard position when it comes to making the correct calls?
19822,2020-09-26 03:34:44,izy9x7,"It is literally too fast for any 4 normal humans to call. I don't know the answer, but same old same old isn't it."
19823,2020-09-26 03:31:38,izy9x7,Thanks officer
19824,2020-09-26 03:32:19,izy9x7,"https://twitter.com/thereplayguy/status/1309694416509169665?s=21

It’s absolutely a penalty, I have no idea what people are complaining about."
19825,2020-09-26 03:34:13,izy9x7,"They called Cernak and Maroon for the exact same type of hold in the 1st and 3rd periods. If Stars fans want to claim Benn wasn't holding, then they're essentially admitting they were gifted two power plays earlier in the game."
19826,2020-09-26 03:31:09,izy9x7,Then the penalty should have been for holding and not tripping.
19827,2020-09-26 03:30:05,izy9x7,"Yeah, I want the replay as well because what stood out to me (and made me not bat an eye at the penalty) was what looked like a stick lifting the Tampa player's leg (while Benn pulled back on his shoulder simultaneously)."
19828,2020-09-26 03:30:30,izy9x7,"He did.  NBC was harping on it being a bad call, but he had a stick under his right leg and dumped him"
19829,2020-09-26 03:36:17,izy9x7,https://twitter.com/thereplayguy/status/1309694416509169665?s=21
19830,2020-09-26 03:31:00,izy9x7,Definitely looked like some sort of penalty. Maybe not a trip but a hold?
19831,2020-09-26 03:32:28,izy9x7,"For sure not. Sure there was a battle on the puck, but you’d have to call it on both dudes not just Benn."
19832,2020-09-26 03:33:01,izy9x7,It was definitely a hold
19833,2020-09-26 03:30:55,izy9x7,"But I’m watching the replay right now and TJ was hooking him at the same time and preventing his forecheck. Looks like a playoff 50/50 battle to me.

Edit: I take it back I see the stick sweeping tf out of his leg."
19834,2020-09-26 03:29:13,izy9x7,"Yeah. It definitely wasn’t a trip as called, and I could be wrong, but I def felt there was a hold there."
19835,2020-09-26 03:29:01,izy9x7,That's a soft ass hold then
19836,2020-09-26 03:30:52,izy9x7,Or the embellishment call
19837,2020-09-26 03:56:26,izy9x7,You’re delusional if you think TyJo is at fault for that accident
19838,2020-09-26 04:06:47,izy9x7,"It's not a universal sentiment, just a vocal minority. No hockey fans regardless of team allegiance would want to see this anywhere in the game."
19839,2020-09-26 04:05:53,izy9x7,Buddy's just a butthurt Colorado fan who can't get over that series. He's posting it everywhere
19840,2020-09-26 04:45:41,izy9x7,">Upvotes and downvotes aren't even supposed to be for agreement and disagreement, but I guess this subreddit forgets that

I mean he's advocating headhunting. He's hoping that your team goes out to hurt the other team. That is a very good reason to downvote someone."
19841,2020-09-26 03:36:09,izy9x7,"There’s no way to get every call right, and reviewing EVERY penalty called would probably be excessive, but the amount of terrible calls late in games should warrant reviews of called penalties very late in games, OT at the very least."
19842,2020-09-26 03:31:57,izy9x7,Did you watch the game?
19843,2020-09-26 03:27:04,izy9x7,"Weak ass call in OT. Swallow the whistle and let the players decide, not the zebras"
19844,2020-09-26 04:12:39,izy9x7,"That’s fair, I think if they were gonna try someone new, tonight would’ve been their shot to do so. I still think Dallas could pull out a win tomorrow, considering how close most of this game was, but my money is still on TB in 6 or 7. I hope for the sake of good hockey that the series lasts at a couple games longer"
19845,2020-09-26 13:16:09,izy9x7,Yes. Because Benn is a turd and fuck Corey Perry.
19846,2020-09-26 05:52:47,izy9x7,Obviously. Your special teams are garbage after all.
19847,2020-09-26 03:28:10,izy9x7,Was it tho? Neither of those were penalties.
19848,2020-09-26 03:47:48,izy9x7,They would have. Both were terrible calls
19849,2020-09-26 03:25:46,izy9x7,That would've sucked for y'all but it didn't happen. This did. Bullshit.
19850,2020-09-26 03:25:27,izy9x7,Lol stf you literally killed a man and got away with it
19851,2020-09-26 03:29:45,izy9x7,you’re bitching about a penalty that no one scored on in a game you won
19852,2020-09-26 03:45:35,izy9x7,Alright thats fucking funny
19853,2020-09-26 03:25:52,izy9x7,That wasn’t even close to a trip. Did you not watch the broadcast? They showed the replay ad nauseum to show how bad of a call it was
19854,2020-09-26 03:25:13,izy9x7,Trip? You must be blind....
19855,2020-09-26 03:39:56,izy9x7,You think he will play tomorrow? I don’t think Bishop can. I think they gotta start Oettinger
19856,2020-09-26 03:27:30,izy9x7,But the trip that injured hintz
19857,2020-09-26 03:28:06,izy9x7,Did the game end on that call? Fuck off.
19858,2020-09-26 04:15:51,izy9x7,"Yes. It doesn't matter how the series ends, Even if we come back and win game 7 the refs have completely ruined these finals for me.

This might surprise you seeing how most people are homers, But someone of us bitch around shitty refing even when shit goes our way."
19859,2020-09-26 04:45:40,izy9x7,Or the 5 on 4 after the 4 on 3...
19860,2020-09-26 03:31:43,izy9x7,Yeah that was a BS call on Point for sure.
19861,2020-09-26 03:28:55,izy9x7,Yep
19862,2020-09-26 03:28:53,izy9x7,Right? Stars had an even more ridiculous call and couldn't put it away. That was their chance to end it.
19863,2020-09-26 03:33:23,izy9x7,So what about the obvious missed tripping on hintz that literally removed him from the game? The number of weak calls against the stars and no calls for the bolts has more them an made up for the embellishment on point. Though I'd argue the penalty on oleksiak was more clearly embellishment.
19864,2020-09-26 03:30:56,izy9x7,"Nope it spat straight facts during that embellishment PP. Lightning did what Stars couldn't. Shoulda coulda woulda, on to game 5."
19865,2020-09-26 03:28:32,izy9x7,Here come the Tampa fans...
19866,2020-09-26 03:29:36,izy9x7,"Just a joke, man. Good luck in game five."
19867,2020-09-26 03:37:19,izy9x7,That doesn’t mean the job is easy for them.
19868,2020-09-26 03:35:14,izy9x7,Because you get the fuck up and work through it.  This isn’t soccer.
19869,2020-09-26 03:51:09,izy9x7,"The difference is even handed officiating. Half the plays throughout that game had penalties from both teams and they went uncalled, but calling even a fairly weak hold that ends up having no bearing on the play  hardly in OT is crap when there's probably several of those earlier that went uncalled.

Stars losing sucks, but if they lose straight up fine. Losing like that is just painful and as I said it cheapens the win for Tampa."
19870,2020-09-26 03:30:38,izy9x7,Remember that time Johnson took Hintz into the boards and out of the game and there was no call?
19871,2020-09-26 03:31:02,izy9x7,I'm actually upset he deleted his comment because this was a teachable moment.
19872,2020-09-26 03:29:46,izy9x7,3 powerplay goals and you think you were the better team tonight?
19873,2020-09-26 04:37:57,izy9x7,"I would love to see them try to pull off an ODR in Tampa lol really, stadium series might just be ticket sales related. Same reason Phoenix gets snubbed while being a league favorite because of Bettman."
19874,2020-09-26 04:05:48,izy9x7,"I don't know about the NHL, but it seems NBC is always on your side and has been for years. 

I remember even 5, 6, 7 years ago. Stamkos was all over the NHLs website, NBC, Ice Warehouse, Hockey Giant, etc.

You guys always act like everyone is against you, when literally everyone is on your side."
19875,2020-09-26 03:59:43,izy9x7,Lol you must be watching an entirely different game
19876,2020-09-26 04:12:09,izy9x7,Hahah true true. I really mean it when I say I’m happy for them and their fans!! But once your own team is out you want to see something crazy! The lightning are so very good I certainly don’t want to take anything away from them. But I wish I could at least get a game 7 out of it!!
19877,2020-09-26 03:42:39,izy9x7,"True. You guys look hard to beat though!

Edit spelling"
19878,2020-09-26 04:25:15,izy9x7,[deleted]
19879,2020-09-26 03:35:32,izy9x7,Lol Lightning had one call go against them and the entire world is ending. Stars have had it the entire playoffs
19880,2020-09-26 03:42:43,izy9x7,You member last year
19881,2020-09-26 03:31:41,izy9x7,"Get fucked, asshole"
19882,2020-09-26 13:01:43,izy9x7,Ya just really frustrating that network ratings determines the schedule of something like this.
19883,2020-09-26 03:47:10,izy9x7,I have the unredacted version of that document.
19884,2020-09-26 03:57:24,izy9x7,"is that true? well that's a better reason than ""because they didn't want to compete with football"". I'm less upset about it, now"
19885,2020-09-26 18:39:44,izy9x7,"After the absolute devastation of last season, the Cup was the only way to come back. Seriously it was soul crushing."
19886,2020-09-26 03:42:49,izy9x7,"Or maybe hockey is a hard sport to ref and they are doing their best. What standard are you comparing to here? “The refs are terrible”. Compared to what? Compared to who? Superhuman refs from your imagination? I like coming here for hockey analysis but 90% of the comments now it seems like are just bitching about the refs or the NBC broadcast. Every game. We get it, they could be better. How about talking about the fact that Dallas maybe just lost to a better hockey team or congratulating Tampa on being a win away from the cup."
19887,2020-09-26 03:28:21,izy9x7,Every fucking game regular season or playoffs lol
19888,2020-09-26 03:32:05,izy9x7,[deleted]
19889,2020-09-26 03:30:00,izy9x7,Corey Perry intensifies
19890,2020-09-26 03:29:20,izy9x7,better than bullshit calls tbh
19891,2020-09-26 03:49:49,izy9x7,"Yeah I'm running the 4th line out there for the whole game... With Schenn and Coburn on the blue line.  Good luck out there boys, we'll get them in game 6."
19892,2020-09-26 03:32:00,izy9x7,"Yeah, the offense was good. They also benefited from some bad calls."
19893,2020-09-26 03:26:07,izy9x7,Dallas is going to pull a Denver Nuggets and win out of a 3-1 hole.
19894,2020-09-26 03:38:19,izy9x7,I'll cosign that.
19895,2020-09-26 06:04:19,izy9x7,"Likely the closest he's ever going to get.

But the Stars are clearly not the better team, despite his best efforts."
19896,2020-09-26 03:29:31,izy9x7,I honestly dislike him more than Pierre or Doc. Once he gets on something he can't let go of it.
19897,2020-09-26 03:33:07,izy9x7,I feel like I'm taking crazy pills reading these comments. In what world is that not a penalty?
19898,2020-09-26 03:31:57,izy9x7,Thanks mate. Was hoping someone would post it.
19899,2020-09-26 03:49:05,izy9x7,"If we watched every hockey play in slow motion over and over, there’d be a dude in the box every minute of the game. Just like there’d be a penalty in football on every play. The outrage is that what they actually did call on Benn (slew foot with his skate) didn’t happen. That’s the most unbiased explanation I can provide at this point."
19900,2020-09-26 03:39:31,izy9x7,"“Slewfooty” is not a penalty. Johnson engages with Benn after he dishes the puck to slow Benn down in his puck pursuit. If that’s a trip then it’s also interference on Johnson. 

In reality neither are penalties."
19901,2020-09-26 03:35:13,izy9x7,Oops Thanks! Clicked the wrong link to copy. Just fixed it.
19902,2020-09-26 03:26:32,izy9x7,I know that part. But it looked like a pretty clear hold to me. I wouldn't mind seeing the replay again to check if I'm right or not.
19903,2020-09-26 03:27:59,izy9x7,"Still pushed his face back with his arm and his skate went in the motion but didnt make contact. Still a penalty. Also, refs missed two highsticks highlighted that the Stars scored off of. They have been shit all series."
19904,2020-09-26 03:28:35,izy9x7,"You sure? He doesn’t use his legs but he jams his stick under Johnson’s leg and then uses his knee to pull it up, while pushing his upper body back. Idk if “tripping” is the right call but it definitely seemed slewfoot-y."
19905,2020-09-26 03:29:32,izy9x7,It did.
19906,2020-09-26 03:38:56,izy9x7,That was definitely holding based on how the refs were calling it. Cernak and Maroon were both sent to the box earlier in the game for doing that exact same thing.
19907,2020-09-26 03:28:19,izy9x7,"Yeah, but Point shouldn't have been called for embellishment either."
19908,2020-09-26 03:52:01,izy9x7,Inaccurate.
19909,2020-09-26 03:35:36,izy9x7,and the booth guys were wrong.
19910,2020-09-26 03:29:46,izy9x7,even doc admitted it was fucked
19911,2020-09-26 16:48:11,izy9x7,"Bogo has been legit good though.  Not too 2 good, but he wasn’t a liability and made some nifty plays."
19912,2020-09-26 05:37:36,izy9x7,"I really don't think that Doc was doing it because he's biased, but it was egregiously bad that he was making a big stink about the Benn penalty being wrong (it wasn't) when he showed none of that energy for the comically bad embellishment call."

19914,2020-09-26 05:12:21,izy9x7,Compared to the hold on Serg tho?
19915,2020-09-26 03:44:46,izy9x7,Thank you.  Some logical sense here finally.
19916,2020-09-26 05:00:03,izy9x7,Rangers fans all eventually end up moving down to Tampa to become Lightning fans.
19917,2020-09-26 09:20:12,izy9x7,Hey now
19918,2020-09-26 04:09:25,izy9x7,"Exactly right. Tampa can't clear the zone to save their lives 5 on 5,but on the penalty kill Dallas is just chasing the puck."
19919,2020-09-26 04:32:21,izy9x7,Definitely true. Our penalty kill was pretty awful and we just couldn’t keep the puck on their side.
19920,2020-09-26 03:40:06,izy9x7,You’re definitely right lol. The lightning played a great game and we weren’t great on the penalty kill. I just like to hate on the refs cuz I have respect for the lightning and don’t wanna hate on them haha
19921,2020-09-26 05:13:30,izy9x7,"It's technically interference IMO.  From the rulebook, 56.1:

Interference - A strict standard on acts of interference must be
adhered to in all areas of the rink.
Body Position: Body position shall be determined as the player
skating in front of or beside his opponent, traveling in
the same direction. A player who is behind an
opponent, who does not have the puck, may not use
his stick, body or free hand in order to restrain his
opponent, but must skate in order to gain or
reestablish his proper position in order to make a
check.
A player is allowed the ice he is standing on
(body position) and is not required to move in order
to let an opponent proceed. A player may “block” the
path of an opponent provided he is in front of his
opponent and moving in the same direction. Moving
laterally and without establishing body position, then
making contact with the non-puck carrier is not
permitted and will be penalized as interference. A
player is always entitled to use his body position to
lengthen an opponent’s path to the puck, ***provided
his stick is not utilized (to make himself “bigger” and
therefore considerably lengthening the distance his
opponent must travel to get where he is going***); his
free hand is not used and he does not take
advantage of his body position to deliver an
otherwise illegal check. 

That'd be a super weak call to make in OT of the Finals, but Johnson got tripped because of it, hence ""just a hockey play"" and shouldn't have been a call either way."
19922,2020-09-26 03:53:47,izy9x7,Oh bullshit. Johnson raises his stick and held off Benn when he was going for the puck. The closest Ref didn’t call it. The guy at the back who couldn’t see shit did.
19923,2020-09-26 04:06:31,izy9x7,Fair enough. Didn't see that.
19924,2020-09-26 03:50:34,izy9x7,Definitely wasn’t tripping lol but that kind of shit happens almost every single time the guys are battling for position.  Weak call but refs want everyone to remember they are in the Stanley cup too.
19925,2020-09-26 03:49:17,izy9x7,"Leaning into someone isn't a penalty. Taking your stick, lifting someone's leg out from under them while simultaneously taking a free hand to shove him down from the top most definitely is. And that's what happened."
19926,2020-09-26 05:07:47,izy9x7,"They're going to lose or have to split the next US TV deal. Doc will retire soon anyways. Edzo has been unusually bad the past couple rounds, and I love Edzo as a Chicago fan. The in studio crew is meh, Kathryn is fine, Patrick and Anson are decent but add no flair, Keith is fine and Liam is bland."
19927,2020-09-26 03:52:04,izy9x7,I didn’t blame the refs. I was stating that it’s the Stanley Cup and swallow the whistle and let the teams battle it out like they used to in the finals
19928,2020-09-26 03:55:52,izy9x7,Back it on up
19929,2020-09-26 03:43:47,izy9x7,***Interesting***
19930,2020-09-26 03:51:35,izy9x7,"holy shit I forgot about Bogo, he out out they said?"
19931,2020-09-26 04:02:35,izy9x7,isn't that what Columbus tried a couple of years ago? At least it's paying off for Tampa lol
19932,2020-09-26 04:46:55,izy9x7,You do anything to win the cup.
19933,2020-09-26 08:09:45,izy9x7,"IDK. As long as we get Cirelli, Cernak, and Serg signed we'll be OK. I could see anyone else taking less to go on another run like Shattenkirk and Maroon. 

If Shattenkirk does leave though he is going to get P A I D."
19934,2020-09-26 12:32:07,izy9x7,"100% should've been tripping.

Related: Do players ever reach out to other players that they injured? Like, with my mentality, if I ever accidentally hurt someone like that, I would just feel awful and call to apologize.

That could be why I'm not a professional athlete though."
19935,2020-09-26 03:37:45,izy9x7,"Yep until they figure out some kinda AI or something every sport will complain about refs.

Maybe if they add in something that lets refs actually review every penalty they call."
19936,2020-09-26 04:21:32,izy9x7,"I feel like I’my taking crazy pills. A hockey play? Yeah, at the lowest depths of the obstruction era, maybe. That was a penalty, pick one of the few it could have been."
19937,2020-09-26 03:33:45,izy9x7,Yeah Benn lifts Johnsons leg with the stick... it's not a slew foot but it's a penalty
19938,2020-09-26 05:01:03,izy9x7,I feel like this is the kind of stuff they never call in the playoffs so everyone does it.
19939,2020-09-26 03:44:54,izy9x7,That's absolutely a slew foot.
19940,2020-09-26 03:41:20,izy9x7,That’s a battle - Johnson initiates that contact and then loses the battle.
19941,2020-09-26 03:36:48,izy9x7,"I mean, he's hooking Benn at the same time for leverage, that's a 50 50 fight"
19942,2020-09-26 03:46:00,izy9x7,No it isn’t but of course you’ll justify Tampa winning from it. Worst call of the playoffs by far.
19943,2020-09-26 04:08:15,izy9x7,Don’t forget Sergachev’s penalty a few minutes earlier.

19945,2020-09-26 03:40:54,izy9x7,Who cares what you want to call it. Benn earned those two PIMs.
19946,2020-09-26 03:35:23,izy9x7,Yeah that's what I said. Same end result.
19947,2020-09-26 03:32:57,izy9x7,Dallas fans just really adamant about accurate record keeping.  It being called a slewfoot and not a holding is gonna keep them up tonight.
19948,2020-09-26 04:33:37,izy9x7,that is exactly what happened
19949,2020-09-26 03:49:18,izy9x7,Yeah that's a penalty
19950,2020-09-26 03:33:30,izy9x7,So like the soft ass Maroon hold earlier in the game?

19953,2020-09-26 04:09:36,izy9x7,"Duh, but I was a bit shocked at how frequent it happened. Think y'all might have some neutrals posing with your flairs or something."
19954,2020-09-26 03:39:08,izy9x7,"People already complain about how much time replay takes.  I am down for SOMETHING particularly with calls like a  high stick where you can see it was his own stick or teammates stick.  I don't think that Benn call would get overturned by replay to be honest.  He still pushed the back of the TBL players leg with his knee, just not his foot.  

Hopefully the embellishment would have been overturned though.  Dude got hooked in the nuts..."
19955,2020-09-26 03:34:07,izy9x7,It’s just funny to see Dallas fans crying over a penalty after that hook to the nutsac. Game would’ve ended then and we all know it
19956,2020-09-26 03:28:21,izy9x7,They should be embarrassed about that embellishment which probably would’ve ended the game there so don’t be too upset buddy
19957,2020-09-26 14:53:01,izy9x7,Just surprised
19958,2020-09-26 10:03:22,izy9x7,Unfortunately very true.

19960,2020-09-26 03:31:24,izy9x7,"Benn has a history of kicking feet out on plays like that.  And he still sweeps with his Knee on the back of the TBL players knee.  I can see how a ref would call that in full speed action.  They don't get replays. 

Point would have had a 2 on 1 and get cup checked from behind and goes down.  Why would anyone embellish in that situation? How did that even cross the refs mind?"
19961,2020-09-26 03:29:10,izy9x7,"I mean it still looked like holding to me. Definitely not a slew foot, but he wrapped around with the free hand"
19962,2020-09-26 03:30:55,izy9x7,So if you won on the 4 on 3 you would've felt the same way right?
19963,2020-09-26 03:31:22,izy9x7,bro what
19964,2020-09-26 03:27:26,izy9x7,"**>**  literally killed a man

I uhh want this replay"

19969,2020-09-26 03:33:23,izy9x7,Are you joking? Benn had his stick between Johnson's legs while pulling him up with his free hand. Trip 100%
19970,2020-09-26 03:42:11,izy9x7,"100% Vasy starts, he's played in every B2B so far."
19971,2020-09-26 03:38:32,izy9x7,Hintz stepped on TyJo’s stick. It absolutely sucks but was not as clear cut as the two people are talking about.
19972,2020-09-26 03:29:24,izy9x7,It could have. Tampa's PP executed and the Stars' didn't. I'd be angry if I was you too though
19973,2020-09-26 03:31:52,izy9x7,"No need to get that butthurt. your teams luck has run out buddy and let’s be real you guys can’t stop the Tampa power play even if you had 2 goalies in net. That game should’ve been over then and you know it. Stars coasted on lucky ass goals, ain’t enough to beat Tampa tho. Get the broom out for that gentlemen’s sweep bb"

19985,2020-09-26 05:16:58,izy9x7,Hard to argue the calls favored TB when Pavelski got away with the highstick and Point got the embellishment call at critical moments in the game.  The Benn penalty was a penalty.
19986,2020-09-26 04:25:59,izy9x7,"And we can score on ours, you on the other hand, big yikes"
19987,2020-09-26 03:38:05,izy9x7,the irony is rich here
19988,2020-09-26 03:48:50,izy9x7,Yes. Still hoping to win the Stanley cup for a second time though!
19989,2020-09-26 03:32:32,izy9x7,Bless your heart.
19990,2020-09-26 04:59:46,izy9x7,"I mean, not wanting to compete with football is totally understandable from a business perspective imo. Do you seriously want the chance a team is going to lift your trophy and that game has less viewers than SNF?"
19991,2020-09-26 05:07:32,izy9x7,"Since games 4-7 all have potential to be elimination games, they get primetime slots and network broadcasting.  Since Sunday Night Football is on NBC, there is no way they could do it Sunday.

In order to end the season before free agency opens, they had to finish by September 30."
19992,2020-09-26 03:48:45,izy9x7,"The issue is that they game manage instead of calling the rules outright. 

Too much ""unwritten rules"" that the refs operate by. 

And the NHL rewards this behaviour."
19993,2020-09-26 03:46:22,izy9x7,Yes. Bad calls go both ways. Sitting in front of your 73inch TV with 6 different camera angles makes it different. The reffs are calling it on ice level in real time. Reffs are not perfect but don't pretend you're team never got a bullshit call go in their favor.
19994,2020-09-26 03:55:31,izy9x7,"What I don't get is, internationally, they seem to do a better job with more ice and one fewer ref."
19995,2020-09-26 11:27:54,izy9x7,"I put this here every time people complain about the officials.

> A goalie that fails to stop pucks 5% of the time is historically great. A shooter that fails to score on 80% of his shots is historically great. But a referee that misses one call in a fast-paced game full of players trying to cheat is awful?

And, as always, I encourage everyone to go sign up to be an official. We could always use new ones, plus you’ll gain a much better appreciation for what the job entails and why calls get missed all the time or are “seemingly bad.”"
19996,2020-09-26 04:29:15,izy9x7,I think the only issue is the review and having someone with an eye in the sky to confirm good and bad calls is a good improvement
19997,2020-09-26 05:24:36,izy9x7,"It's like I've said before, you know how you end questionable calls? Stop making questionable plays. That last Benn penalty, maybe it is but maybe it isnt. Its playoff hockey and Benn put himself in the position for that call to be made."
19998,2020-09-26 03:53:20,izy9x7,"I get the excuse it's a hard sport to ref because you can miss a lot of shit. But how does that explain make up calls, or the even up the power plays to make it seem fair. What about inconsistentcy in calls, shouldn't everything that's a penalty be called or do we just guess? I'm not even referencing this game but shit like this has been happening forever.

Every hockey fan just wants to be able to watch a play and know if it's a penalty, our eyes shouldn't have to be going to the refs to see if their arms are up."
19999,2020-09-26 11:17:01,izy9x7,Of the major sports hockey refs are by far the highest quality honestly. Nba and Nfl refs are just pure garbage and mlb umps are out of control
20000,2020-09-26 03:35:19,izy9x7,Oh yeah. Trust the Russians to be honest and call games with no bias.
20001,2020-09-26 04:40:48,izy9x7,Point's pain in his nuts intensifies
20002,2020-09-26 03:30:16,izy9x7,"Fair enough.

But if it weren't for bullshit calls, the Bolts would've been on the PP to start OT."

20014,2020-09-26 05:32:05,izy9x7,"A penalty is a penalty regardless of what they call it. That was 100% a penalty by Benn. It’s very often that a tripping gets called a hook or a hold or vice versa, but as long as it’s a deserved 2 mins in the box, who gives a shit what it’s called?"
20015,2020-09-26 03:43:46,izy9x7,"Slewfooting is a penalty, it falls under tripping. Which was what was called. Do you not see Benn knee his stick to sweep out Johnson’s leg while pushing his upper body back?"

20018,2020-09-26 03:44:22,izy9x7,"The difference to me is that those two penalties had a direct effect on the play. In this instance, the hold doesn’t have an impact on the play. I think they should have let play continue and give a warning to Benn especially in Stanley cup finals overtime game. But doesn’t matter as they called tripping. I didn’t expect the stars to win the series going in, but wish it wasn’t like this."
20019,2020-09-26 03:30:11,izy9x7,"Agreed. Perry should have been the only penalty on that play, but I was talking about the penalty on Benn."
20020,2020-09-26 03:38:04,izy9x7,"This is my problem with this series, you’re right but it sucks that instead of talking about hockey we’re all left at the end trying to be like ‘well shitty call #1 cancels out shitty call #2 and #3...’

If they were just doing a better job it wouldn’t be such a point of emphasis for both teams"
20021,2020-09-26 03:29:33,izy9x7,Radulov shouldn't have been called for the hooking last game... see how this works?
20022,2020-09-26 03:38:09,izy9x7,"Disagree, but I'm glad that I'm getting downvoted for it.

What part of that play was a slewfoot?"
20023,2020-09-26 03:33:21,izy9x7,"They were saying it wasn't a trip or slewfoot, which is true. But that was a blatant hold and you guys complaining or quoting the commentators doesn't change that. It was so obviously a penalty idk how you can argue it after getting handed some free calls including that terrible embellishment call."
20024,2020-09-26 06:22:49,izy9x7,I thought it was Olczyk who was losing his mind over it

20031,2020-09-26 05:12:17,izy9x7,I don't fucking get it. Like are we trying too hard to execute down specific play on the PP? We pass the puck for 20-30 seconds and then it gets cleared. Fuck it's frustrating to watch considering we're fine 5 on 5
20032,2020-09-26 03:40:43,izy9x7,"Same. I like the Lightning a lot and I’m not mad at them. We outplayed them tonight though and this series should be 2-2. Fuck injuries, and fuck the refs"

this is exactly what Jamie Benn did and he got called"
20034,2020-09-26 03:58:04,izy9x7,"not bullshit at all. watch it again. Johnson got inside position to get to the puck, that's not illegal. Benn was behind him and that's how he managed to get his stick behind Johnson's leg. it was the right call"
20035,2020-09-26 04:08:57,izy9x7,Wait you’re trying to say the stars should’ve gotten a pp from that?
20036,2020-09-26 04:37:25,izy9x7,I upvoted your original comment because of this. You are cool Olig.
20037,2020-09-26 03:55:19,izy9x7,"Go watch the replay again. Benn gets his stick between Johnson's legs and lifts one of them up while also holding him and pulling his top half backwards. The fact that you think it wasn't a penalty at all when it easily could have been a trip or a hold is laughable.

The rulebook disagrees

> Rule 56 – Interference

> Body Position: Body position shall be determined as the player
skating in front of or beside his opponent, traveling in
the same direction. **A player who is behind an
opponent, who does not have the puck, may not use
his stick, body or free hand in order to restrain his
opponent**, but must skate in order to gain or
reestablish his proper position in order to make a
check.

>A player is allowed the ice he is standing on
(body position) and is not required to move in order
to let an opponent proceed. ... **Moving
laterally and without establishing body position, then
making contact with the non-puck carrier is not
permitted and will be penalized as interference.**"

20041,2020-09-26 04:48:51,izy9x7,"We traded Wheeler for Peverley, and we don't win the cup in 2011 with 2011 Wheeler in the lineup instead of Peverley.  If you win, it's sure as hell worth it"

20043,2020-09-26 03:45:55,izy9x7,Benn has one hand on the end of his stick and you think he has enough leverage to lift Johnsons leg up? You can't be serious.
20044,2020-09-26 03:40:29,izy9x7,The second you take your hand off your stick and use it on another player you're opening yourself up to a penalty call.
20045,2020-09-26 03:54:30,izy9x7,"If you think that call which was an actual penalty, granted more a hold then a trip, is worse then the embellishment when point gets hooked in the nuts you need to take off the homer glasses or learn hockey"
20046,2020-09-26 03:42:14,izy9x7,"That call was made twice earlier in the game. Both Cernak and Maroon took a hand off their stick and used their free hand to impede and wrap up the opposing player. That is exactly what Benn did.

The tripping call is wrong, but it is absolutely still is a penalty based on how they called holding earlier in the game."
20047,2020-09-26 03:41:23,izy9x7,You can't take your hand off your stick and use it on a guy like that. You're immediately opening yourself up to a penalty call when you do that

20053,2020-09-26 03:31:35,izy9x7,It’s the SCF in overtime. Get your head out of your ass. That wasn’t a good penalty on Benn.
20054,2020-09-26 03:33:05,izy9x7,I am saying that the embellishment penalty on Point and the tripping penalty on Benn were both BS. The Perry penalty was warranted.
20055,2020-09-26 03:39:01,izy9x7,"He was hooking Benn as well in that, it was a 50/50 fight"

The trip on Hints, the boarding of Comau,  what should have been icing in the 3rd, multiple trips and hold not called, crosschecking not called and then the two we get are horrible calls when there are a plethora of good one to be made.

20072,2020-09-26 08:03:37,izy9x7,"THIS RIGHT HERE! It's the inconsistency that drives everyone crazy. Either they swallow their whistles or call ""everything"". 

They should call the playoffs the same way they call the regular season. Full stop. 

If it's a penalty and the ref sees it, it should be called. I understand that mistakes will still be made and calls will be missed but at least TRY to be consistent...

At least then everyone would have a lot less tangle shit to bitch about."

20084,2020-09-26 15:34:59,izy9x7,"True enough.

I can see Dallas taking this to 6, but probably not to 7.

With injuries finally catching up with the stars (their pk is decimated) and Dobby playing like he's human, with no real backup, this doesn't feel like a 7 game series."

20086,2020-09-26 05:41:40,izy9x7,"Pierre is very knowledgable, but I don't buy the ""people hate Pierre because he's a nerd"" theory one bit. I think a lot of people hate him because he seems to pick favorites, has an incredibly awkward personality (at least on air), and often tries to jam irrelevant tidbits into the broadcast for no real reason. I don't have a seething hatred for him like a lot of people, but he's just not particularly good at his job. Almost nothing would be lost if they cut him from the broadcast."
20087,2020-09-26 04:16:28,izy9x7,"My one thing with Pierre is that he seems to pick a team he’s more excited for each series. One team he’ll get loud for every time they have a shot on goal, the other team you can barely even tell they have it in the zone with how little enthusiasm he has when they shoot."
20088,2020-09-26 05:25:14,izy9x7,He's a little weird at times but he knows his stuff for sure.

20093,2020-09-26 03:49:27,izy9x7,"Was the reach over the shoulder and pull back not a penalty in your mind? I don't see it as a full on slewfoot, but it's at the very least a holding penalty."
20094,2020-09-26 03:40:47,izy9x7,"None of it was outside of the stick under his leg, but it was also a hold.

If you don't want to be called for a slewfoot accidentally don't hold the guy until it looks like you're doing a slewfoot."

20098,2020-09-26 05:21:59,izy9x7,"Lmao, I feel the same way about the Avs. If we're had even 1 out of ever 8 pp chances vs the Stars, we'd be in the final. Frustrating to watch them just pass and pass looking for the perfect shot"
20099,2020-09-26 05:30:06,izy9x7,"In this we can bond. Although I'm not sure what happened, your powerplay was lethal against the Avs"
20100,2020-09-26 20:38:47,izy9x7,My guess is that they're trying to play keep away to tire out and confuse the Tampa defense but aren't able to get far with puck possession. It is absolutely maddening to watch.
20101,2020-09-26 05:18:33,izy9x7,"If you watch the replay, Johnson stuck his stick out to his right across Benn's body to slow him down before the trip.  Benn was trying to fight thru it to get to the puck.  It's OT in the Finals, let em play."
20102,2020-09-26 03:58:44,izy9x7,Inside position using his stick to hold off a player. That’s a penalty.
20103,2020-09-26 04:09:38,izy9x7,Nope. No penalty should have been called at all. That’s what the closest ref decided.
20104,2020-09-26 07:46:24,izy9x7,Ditto. Mad respect for changing his opinion when contrary evidence was presented. We could all use more of that ability.
20105,2020-09-26 04:28:02,izy9x7,Seen the replay. It wasn’t a trip. That shit happens 10000 times a game. Literally happens every time a puck goes into a corner. It’s holding but it’s a weak call that happens all the time.
20106,2020-09-26 04:04:16,izy9x7,"I would strongly disagree with the assessment that he was restraining his opponent by his positioning. Have you even watched a replay? He goes for the puck, and almost immediately, Benn's stick goes under his leg and he pushes him down with his free hand. You make it sound like he was skating into Benn for an extended period of time...he was skating to the puck."
20107,2020-09-26 04:34:24,izy9x7,And because Bogo cost us a goal by getting chippy after a hit in Game 1. Coop wasn't having that shit.
20108,2020-09-26 04:00:20,izy9x7,"If you watch it, Benn uses his own leg as leverage for the stick"
20109,2020-09-26 04:06:21,izy9x7,"Nah. That was a terrible call as well, I don’t dispute that, but it wasn’t a game decider."

20112,2020-09-26 07:35:12,izy9x7,You're right. Benn shouldn't have tripped and held Johnson. Bad penalty for a captain to take in OT.
20113,2020-09-26 03:36:22,izy9x7,"I am saying that on the scale of BS, the Point embellishment call is inline with the Glendening phantom goalie interference call where Holtby just fell with no one within 6ft of him.  

The Benn penalty might look like a bad call in a replay with slow motion.  But at full speed, and given that Benn does that shit all the time, its much less of a bull shit call."
20114,2020-09-26 03:30:40,izy9x7,what homer goggles am I wearing?
20115,2020-09-26 04:01:36,izy9x7,I'd say he has to. No way down 3-1 are you gonna throw a young guy or an injured Bishop out there.
20116,2020-09-26 03:47:55,izy9x7,"I said the call sucked but it was a lot tougher one than the two we’re currently discussing. Maybe I didn’t phrase it properly, my bad."

20137,2020-09-26 03:36:50,izy9x7,The one where Coleman turned the stick pulled him down with him
20138,2020-09-26 03:55:42,izy9x7,"He reached, but it was fighting for puck positioning and he never held back his progress. That's not a call refs would even make in youth hockey, much less in overtime in the Cup."

20141,2020-09-26 05:19:51,izy9x7,"he stuck his stick across Benn's stick, before Benn reached over Johnson's shoulder and grabbed his arm to pull Johnson's stick into Benn's body. the more I watch it, the less it looks like Johnson even makes contact with his stick before Benn grabbed Johnson's arm to pull it towards him. i'm all for letting them play, but this was a pretty conspicuous penalty. trip with the leg + one hand off the stick + reaching over Johnson's shoulder to grab his arm and stick and pull him"
20142,2020-09-26 04:01:52,izy9x7,"no, it isn't. they're both going after a loose puck. in fact, the [rule specifically says](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooking_(ice_hockey)

>""when a player is checking another in such a way that there is only stick-to-stick contact, such action is not to be penalized as hooking.""

Johnson's stick is in position to make stick to stick contact. in fact, the only reason it even comes up is directly because Benn pulls Johnson's arm. Before Benn pulls his arm, Johnson is making stick to stick contact"
20143,2020-09-26 04:11:09,izy9x7,"https://twitter.com/TheReplayGuy/status/1309694416509169665?s=20
Just watch benns stick. And don’t mind his left arm over Johnson’s shoulder grabbing his stick and pulling him backwards."
20144,2020-09-26 04:42:05,izy9x7,"If you're seeing that play that often, maybe you should watch someone other than the Stars for a bit. Benn must have you desensitized.

As for it being a weak hold, go watch the call on Maroon earlier in the game where he barely touched the Stars player, while Johnson got tossed to the ice here.

I get being upset at your team losing and at the terrible reffing, but try to remember 4 minutes before this call the Lightning were assessed a minor for Point getting speared in the balls. As far as bad calls go, the Benn trip wasn't even in the same universe."
20145,2020-09-26 04:04:39,izy9x7,"https://twitter.com/TheReplayGuy/status/1309694416509169665

Edit: Comment I was replying to was stealth edited to add everything after the first sentence. Yes I've watched the replay, and what you describe is not what happened lol. He does not go for the puck, he goes to tie up Benn and take his positioning."
20146,2020-09-26 16:52:48,izy9x7,"He also said one of Schenn and Bogo was unfit and the other was a scratch.  I’m inclined to think Bogo is hurt.  If one bad play got you benched, Shatty wouldn’t have been playing last night."
20147,2020-09-26 18:07:32,izy9x7,"Yeah, I kinda thought that in game 2, but Rutta hasn’t exactly inspired confidence. And as u/allen_koholic said, Shattenkirk should have been banished to the Latvian 3rd division after game 5 vs the Isles if it’s purely based on a bad/disastrous shift. 





I think they just value the consistency of Hedman-Rutta and when you’re going 12-6 they go that way."
20148,2020-09-26 04:07:07,izy9x7,"Because you didn't capitalize, that's in the Stars not the refs"
20149,2020-09-26 04:19:32,izy9x7,It was deleted on the Stars subreddit as well...
20150,2020-09-26 03:39:34,izy9x7,I agree. Slow motion does change perception and Benn does have a history. I hate bitching about refs and I’m just disappointed this game had to end with some BS. I have no horse in the race. I just want to see good hockey.
20151,2020-09-26 03:32:52,izy9x7,Clearly the Islanders want the lightning to win over their heated rival the Stars
20152,2020-09-26 04:50:31,izy9x7,Vancouver...
20153,2020-09-26 03:51:42,izy9x7,"All good, it's just really frustrating to come into a series happy and wanting to watch some good hockey and yet 4 games in I'm completely over it, not because my team is down but because there officiating has been so unbelievably bad that it takes all the enjoyment out of watching as a fan of the game. It's honestly unwatchable at this point."
20154,2020-09-26 03:43:44,izy9x7,I was screaming when I realized he wasn't on the ice. What a moron. Klingberg has the best blue line wrist shot in the league and you aren't putting him on the ice on a 4 on 3 to win the game. Jesus Christ. Saving him for next year?
20155,2020-09-26 03:55:47,izy9x7,Pure luck
20156,2020-09-26 05:28:38,izy9x7,[removed]
20157,2020-09-26 03:36:42,izy9x7,Sorry very true

20159,2020-09-26 03:54:37,izy9x7,"Well, the concept is pretty simple. You had no flair. I told you to flair up. You flaired up."
20160,2020-09-26 05:47:01,izy9x7,"Perfectly fine. Everyone has their own tastes in broadcasters and there's no definitive answer by any means. At the very least, I think dismissing criticism of him as being a product of people not liking nerds is off base and ignores legit critiques."
20161,2020-09-26 03:59:28,izy9x7,"I don't know how you can watch that replay and say he didn't impede his progress with the pull, but go ahead and have your opinion."
20162,2020-09-26 04:05:57,izy9x7,He hooked his body. It’s hooking. You are blind.
20163,2020-09-26 04:12:49,izy9x7,"Thanks for reposting the same highlight we’ve all seen. It’s a non call in overtime.

Just enjoy the win and move on. When this is all over nobody is gonna remember the bullshit calls."
20164,2020-09-26 04:57:31,izy9x7,"Lol desensitized? When did you start watching hockey? The game has been getting softer and softer each year.  I thought the 4 minutes was bogus, Perry is an idiot.  maroon didn’t barely touch him. But it’s weak call. But your missing the point. The refs make too many weak calls and making the league soft"
20165,2020-09-26 04:09:22,izy9x7,"Yes, and if you can look at that and not see an absolutely blatant fucking penalty on Benn you have the blinders on so tightly they're squishing your brain."
20166,2020-09-26 04:09:49,izy9x7,"You’re right, they didn’t, that doesn’t make it any less bad. I’m not blaming Tampa for scoring dude, they played great and capitalized and true, Dallas didn’t. A game shouldn’t come down to being lost or won with shameful officiating. We can agree on that much."
20167,2020-09-26 04:22:47,izy9x7,"uh, cool? Good for y'all? Not sure how that means anything when yo say ""I only saw it this one time"" and i'm saying ""yea and I saw it a bunch more in the GDT prior to deletion""."
20168,2020-09-26 03:42:49,izy9x7,"https://twitter.com/TheReplayGuy/status/1309694416509169665?s=20

I mean look at the call from this angle.  Arm draped over his shoulder from behind.  Stick lifting the TBL players leg up.  People might not like the call but to say its straight bullshit call is exaggerated.  

That could easily be holding and a trip."
20169,2020-09-26 03:52:33,izy9x7,"I feel you. If anything, we feel the same way. NHL reffing is dog shit."
20170,2020-09-26 04:31:19,izy9x7,"From Fort Worth, can’t wait to take another W on Victory Avenue."
20171,2020-09-26 04:01:34,izy9x7,"Agree to disagree, but there's nothing wrong with that"
20172,2020-09-26 04:08:23,izy9x7,you are so obviously not watching the video. there is no hook at any point. literally the first thing Jamie Benn does is grab Johnson by his stick and directly pull it towards his own body
20173,2020-09-26 06:27:33,izy9x7,Ah the old double down after the clear replay.   Wasn’t expecting this
20174,2020-09-26 04:14:51,izy9x7,It should have been coincidentals or no call either way. I'm not saying Tampa should get the only call here or anything
20175,2020-09-26 04:18:35,izy9x7,"Agree on that, I just think that was a penalty on Benn. He wrapped the free hand around Johnson, grabbed his stick and hauled him to the ice

If the ref didn't say slew footing and said holding then no one is arguing that call. Benn had been getting away with that all series but when you take your hand off your stick and grab the player you are opening yourself up to a penalty. Tampa got two calls tonight for holding that were similar.

Refs have been terrible both ways but I agree with that call"
20176,2020-09-26 04:08:48,izy9x7,No it’s a hook. You are blind.
20177,2020-09-26 06:28:30,izy9x7,Clear replay lol.
20178,2020-09-26 04:23:08,izy9x7,"All I know man is that I love this Dallas team, and if they lose the series I’ll be disappointed but I won’t be bitter. Your team is phenomenal and there’s no shame in losing to your boys. I just expect better from the game than to ruin a series with inconsistent, sporadic and frantic whistle blowing for weak calls then not for others. It has been that way all series and for both sides, but that just takes away from the actual two teams and their play completely. Win or lose this series isn’t even fun anymore. I just wanted to see an ultimate series battled out, but that’s been taken away from the players in too many ways. You guys will win tomorrow after this game, I’m not being negative with that prediction, I just believe it will be the case. Either way, we ain’t winning three straight. Congratulations."
20179,2020-09-26 04:09:24,izy9x7,"it's not, but keep crying about it. enjoy your cup loss"
20180,2020-09-26 04:26:03,izy9x7,"I agree with the officiating being terrible both ways all series and it really taking away from the game. I apologise for coming off strong. Was hyped up, a little drunk, and have been arguing with other Dallas Fans saying Tampa doesn't deserve to win and refs are giving them the game."
20181,2020-09-26 04:10:08,izy9x7,You’re still blind.
20182,2020-09-26 04:35:15,izy9x7,"Nah I didn’t think you came off wrong at all.  But likewise for me if I came off as the same, I’m just annoyed with being down to a hood team and how poor the calls have been, hindering both teams from being their best or most fun to watch. Nobody is ever happy for both sides tho lol, way she goes. Good luck tomorrow, hope to steal the game to at least have hockey around a little longer"
20183,2020-09-26 04:12:49,izy9x7,nope. not at all. keep those tears coming though
20184,2020-09-26 04:14:04,izy9x7,Are you in my room? That’s creepy. Blind and creepy.

20256,2020-09-24 19:00:47,iz2t2s,Crazy what super famous comedians get to do by doing bits at parties. Bee Movie was made entirely because of one bit Seinfeld did in a Hollywood party.
20257,2020-09-24 19:04:35,iz2t2s,This feels like a cut subplot from *The Player*
20258,2020-09-24 20:20:06,iz2t2s,"As someone who has seen every Saw film theatrically, bring this shit the fuck on, yo."
20259,2020-09-24 19:32:42,iz2t2s,Wait so...the new Saw is a comedy?
20260,2020-09-24 20:19:36,iz2t2s,I think the most interesting thing about the new 'Saw' movie is how little is out there about it since that franchise went stale really quick.
20261,2020-09-25 00:32:27,iz2t2s,Even worse that Tyler Perry made *two* of those Madea Halloween pictures.
20262,2020-09-24 21:36:22,iz2t2s,"Well, because of that and because of his love of GIANT WOMEN. UGGGGH"
20263,2020-09-25 05:19:34,iz2t2s,"The best standup I've ever seen was Eddie Murphy waiting on the valet leaving a glitzy fundraiser, so this tracks"
20264,2020-09-25 22:21:09,iz2t2s,"Honestly, the live action trailer for *Bee Movie* featuring Spielberg makes the whole endeavor worthwhile."
20265,2020-09-24 20:06:37,iz2t2s,No. It’s based on a comedy bit but the movie is an investigative thriller. But it’s probably a Comedy like how Get Out is a comedy.

20267,2020-09-24 21:37:04,iz2t2s,It says “in the comedic style of 48 hours” right there
20268,2020-09-24 20:47:57,iz2t2s,I remember the trailer being a nice surprise since it seemed like a grounded reboot. I just wonder if its a total fresh start.
20269,2020-09-24 21:40:15,iz2t2s,"If this movie turns out to be some crazy dark comedy, then i will probably love it even more! I was already excited when i saw the trailer and the fact it could possibly be a Chris Rock led comedy, I’ll lose my mind."

20275,2020-09-23 15:17:11,iya5rv,"Man, MGIII's 80% snap share is insane for a 5th round fantasy pick. But he's already been a TD dependent player with his 50/50 split partner Linday only out for a couple more weeks. Not to mention without Sutton and Lock, the offense drops down a few pegs. Is he a prime sell-high candidate?"

20285,2020-09-23 17:03:04,iya5rv,"People complaining about Joe Mixon should be happy with his bad games being 6-10 points. Last season he had games with rushing yard totals of 10, 17, 10, and 2. Your best option is to hold until he starts having good games again. Which he will."

20297,2020-09-23 16:15:29,iya5rv,Thanks for compiling this! I have a tough decision between Henderson and Hines for RB2 this week while I wait on Mostert. Gaskin is still available (at the moment) in our league. Any thoughts?
20298,2020-09-23 16:16:53,iya5rv,Great post. I hope you continue to do this!
20299,2020-09-23 16:45:11,iya5rv,I can’t believe how bad both Chris Thompson and Tarik Cohen have been. I drafted both thinking at least ONE of them would be usable as a bye week fill in/flex play. Now I got stuck having to drop the bank on freeman cuz I had no other options
20300,2020-09-23 17:20:49,iya5rv,Picked up D.Montgomery on a whim in the 7th. So far so good! Hoping he can keep up decent FLEX numbers at least.

20316,2020-09-23 14:13:53,iya5rv,With how much we saw Gio last 2 weeks you would think he was Kareem Hunt (minus the production ofc)
20317,2020-09-23 14:48:57,iya5rv,Theres only so much you can gleam off this though. Looking at aaron jones stats you would hardly think someone with <50% snaps would be a top5 rb contender.
20318,2020-09-23 17:18:16,iya5rv,"As long as he's getting 20 touches a game we don't need to worry...

...right?"
20319,2020-09-23 18:20:15,iya5rv,I think that was because of game script
20320,2020-09-23 20:26:57,iya5rv,I hate zac taylor
20321,2020-09-24 08:21:32,iya5rv,My boy burrow had over 60 pass attempts (0 int woohoo!) Cause he's behind the worst line in the league. We can't even let mixon do his thing when he can't even reach the line of scrim out of the I formation. I wish they'd just bench burrow for the season until we can protect this man. Next year we better go all O line fuck everything
20322,2020-09-23 14:31:42,iya5rv,Swift is on my bench waiting in the wings to be my RB2
20323,2020-09-23 16:13:31,iya5rv,It is but looks as though Swift at least has carved out a role to start the season.  I would be shocked if he doesn't start getting more carries as the season goes on.

20327,2020-09-23 14:09:26,iya5rv,Think Jackson coming back soon hurts him ROS
20328,2020-09-23 16:20:43,iya5rv,"he went up against Pittsburgh defense and he still had a solid week. as long as the volume stays similar, MGIII will produce and I don't see any reason to sell him right now unless ur weak at WR"
20329,2020-09-23 16:52:08,iya5rv,Prime sell high especially with his name value. He will NOT be ass good when Lindsey returns. The volume will be cut in half and they will probably be in a 50-50 split.
20330,2020-09-23 18:56:17,iya5rv,"I keep seeing people tirelessly thumping this narrative that Lock is a good QB, and it mystifies me. The dude has not looked the part of a starting NFL QB and his stats are pedestrian, at best. Lock going down does not change Gordon’s value."
20331,2020-09-23 13:37:36,iya5rv,Took one week for him to make Barber irrelevant.  I give it a few more  before McKissic is an afterthought (although not gonna lie McKissic actually looked pretty good on Sunday.)
20332,2020-09-23 15:12:30,iya5rv,"I have Gibson and Robinson to pair with Zeke, Sanders and Carson. 

Kinda surprised I haven’t gotten a single trade offer yet."
20333,2020-09-23 16:01:34,iya5rv,I'm still waiting on that one. He's been biding his time on my bench but until he shows the numbers I don't know if I can give him a start. I'm gonna go either Davis or Gaskin over him
20334,2020-09-23 21:24:18,iya5rv,I don't know it was still only good for 12 with a TD he needs more catches to raise his floor in PPR
20335,2020-09-23 14:04:32,iya5rv,"I haven't watched a Jags game but I'm guessing he just isn't good at pass protection yet?  Would make sense if that's the case why Thompson is on the field half the game but gets the ball way less.  I could see that backfield going either way.  Could see him improving in pass pro and getting on the field more, or a few guys come back and he loses touches (I don't think that scenario is likely.)"
20336,2020-09-23 21:25:56,iya5rv,Yeah that would make you think that his numbers are inflated and Thompson will get more work.
20337,2020-09-23 21:44:19,iya5rv,Just traded him for Marquise Brown. Still not sure how I feel about it.
20338,2020-09-23 21:45:36,iya5rv,Best $10 I ever spent
20339,2020-09-23 14:52:59,iya5rv,You realize he was just filling in for James White last week? Which makes him one of the better buy low RB’s in all of PPR. Cam loves throwing to RB’s out of the backfield. Always has.
20340,2020-09-23 14:13:27,iya5rv,Their best back won’t play till week 4
20341,2020-09-23 14:03:30,iya5rv,He burned me so bad last year that I’ll never touch him again. Teams holding him this year will soon learn the same lesson
20342,2020-09-23 16:26:47,iya5rv,Not a fan of selling low. I'd have to get another buy low candidate back
20343,2020-09-23 16:08:37,iya5rv,"People will die on that Volume hill, I’m hoping he steps it up."
20344,2020-09-23 16:33:48,iya5rv,"On one hand, he got brutally gamescripted. On the other hand, this is looking to be more like a brutal seasonscript with that horrible offense."
20345,2020-09-23 14:49:12,iya5rv,"If you’re 0-2, Henderson. If you’re 2-0 I’d go Dobbins."
20346,2020-09-23 14:46:10,iya5rv,"Dobbins has that league winning upside, I'd go with him for sure"
20347,2020-09-23 14:15:28,iya5rv,Henderson for now with their RB injuries. Dobbins is going to be so hit or miss with a lot of missed with how much they rotate that backfield and Lamar runs a lot himself.
20348,2020-09-23 16:49:18,iya5rv,Take gaskins>Henderson>Hines
20349,2020-09-23 14:47:54,iya5rv,"He's rb27 overall in my half ppr, half ppfd league. When you factor in CMC, Saquon, and Mostert wont be active, that leaves only 23 guys with more points on the season and thatll be playing next week. But ya know, now that I have to play him, he'll probably shit the bed and itll be the JoHo show 🤷‍♂️"
20350,2020-09-23 14:57:28,iya5rv,Yes. AP is not the future in Detroit with Swift and Kerryon(spelling?) Johnson there. He's there to mentor mostly. Gaskin has been dominating the job that we all thought Brieda or Howard was going to take easily. They leaned on him late last season too after Ballage was let go so I think they see something in him and will continue giving him a good share until he proves they shouldn't trust him
20351,2020-09-23 14:31:08,iya5rv,I unloaded Mixon for Kittle. I'm off that train
20352,2020-09-23 16:06:46,iya5rv,"Those highlights comparing their plays was sad! Gio was a beast maybe 4 seasons ago, but they need to keep giving Joe a chance to make plays out in the open field."
20353,2020-09-23 16:15:27,iya5rv,"yeah the bengals ran so many plays that even at a ~55% share mixon has had as many snaps as kamara. the work is there, the bengals just have to get their shit together. iirc mixon also had a rough start last season and came on stronger in the second half. caveat: double mixon owner plz get shit together"
20354,2020-09-23 18:47:27,iya5rv,"I disagree w this though, Aaron Jones has something like 12 red zone touches and 14 targets and other rbs around that area are guys like Kamara or ceh. The chiefs came out and specifically targeted ceh in their passing game as part of the game plan this week and he still had similar targets this week and overall to Jones

Mixons issue, as an owner, is relevant certainly but I think overblown. He always gets better as the season progresses, and the Bengals want to protect their new qb so have a pass blocking rb in more often. They've also been playing from behind a ton which is when they'd need that extra level of protection for burrow

Gio hasn't been healthy a full season in a while, and even if he's healthy all season hard not to see the Bengals giving Mixon 16- 20 touches a game as they've done since they got him considering the money they just gave him"
20355,2020-09-23 16:36:41,iya5rv,"i'm hoping he takes a miles sanders track, slowish start and then a monster finish"
20356,2020-09-23 18:30:25,iya5rv,Ive started him in 14 team 0.5ppr and its been fine. I probably wouldnt if the Lions are ever favored to take the lead since were banking on pass catching.
20357,2020-09-23 22:59:46,iya5rv,"I drafted him for his potential late season upside... but then Black Sunday hit and I needed RB's NOW. I hope it doesn't bite me in the ass.

Ended up grabbing JRob and Kelley so so far I feel it was a good move."
20358,2020-09-23 20:47:50,iya5rv,should we tell him?
20359,2020-09-23 21:25:09,iya5rv,I would if someone didn't say that Swift got benched for him near the end of the game for fucking up his Pass Pro
20360,2020-09-23 19:45:40,iya5rv,"I'm in the same boat.  The common wisdom has always been that Thursday night games favor RB's because of simplified gameplans and lower scores, but the combined scores of the last two games are 54 and 65 points.  I think no crowd noise is really helping the passing game this year."
20361,2020-09-23 23:00:54,iya5rv,I can't decide between Kelley or Parker. I'm leaning Kelley cause coming off a soft tissue injury for a short week feels bad.
20362,2020-09-24 13:16:53,iya5rv,Chark is banged up going into a Thursday game no thanks. Its between Kelley and Gaskin for me. (I am in the same situation)
20363,2020-09-23 22:23:08,iya5rv,Kelley.  I think Cole is the wr to have right now for the jags.
20364,2020-09-23 14:35:52,iya5rv,dont think its going to matter unless he gets hurt
20365,2020-09-23 15:24:41,iya5rv,Not too worried about Jackson tbh.
20366,2020-09-23 14:48:10,iya5rv,"This, but actually no."
20367,2020-09-23 16:27:11,iya5rv,"But his volume will certainly decrease (the question is how much, not if it will) though with Lindsay coming back next week or the one after. They were in a dead even committee in the first half of the Steelers game, with Lindsay seeing a bit more work. Even if it goes down to a 60/40 distribution in favor of MGIII, that’s a pretty significant drop off from the 90% of RB carries and 80% of RB snaps he’s seeing now. I fully believe in MGIII’s talent, but I don’t think his volume stays “similar” any way you look at it.

I say all this as a happy MGIII owner"
20368,2020-09-23 14:41:55,iya5rv,JD McKissic will look good moving forward until he’s hurt. He’s made of glass and had never finished a season with the Seahawks and when he played for the lions his biggest season was like 240 yards.
20369,2020-09-23 15:20:50,iya5rv,"im in the same boat but with conner instead of carson.

Only offers i’ve got are ones that I would never consider"
20370,2020-09-23 14:45:57,iya5rv,"no he is good in pass protection, thats one of the things gruden said he was so surprised to see out of Robinson

jags were down the whole game so chris thompson was in a lot, as we all know how much gruden loves him

If anything this stat line is encouraging getting 16 carries and 3 receptions on half the snaps... if the jags are leading any game i expect 20+ carries, maybe even 5+ targets a game... 

Source: Jags fan"
20371,2020-09-23 15:59:29,iya5rv,I agree but I think what we saw from Burkhead last week is Whites ceiling (4 or 5 rushes and 4 or 5 catches). Not super compelling unless it's full PPR
20372,2020-09-23 18:45:47,iya5rv,"Can’t help but think James White will get a healthy number of looks this week, returning after such a huge loss."
20373,2020-09-23 14:41:39,iya5rv,Harris? I stashed him in an IR spot just to see what happens when he comes back.
20374,2020-09-23 14:14:21,iya5rv,Hell be good down the stretch
20375,2020-09-24 03:25:45,iya5rv,"It's not selling low when this is literally who he is, a 7-10 point a week RB with TD upside."
20376,2020-09-23 16:53:36,iya5rv,It’s unreal. I bought into him this year too but bailed after week 1 when all the red flags from first half of last season flashed red. Targeted a weak team that needed running back. Upgraded at TE and receiver and not looking back
20377,2020-09-28 23:31:27,iya5rv,"Worked out okay. Went with Gaskin, kept Henderson on the bench and dumped Hines. At least I have better rb depth now."
20378,2020-09-23 15:38:34,iya5rv,ppfd? points per flotation device?
20379,2020-09-23 15:53:03,iya5rv,"Watched him live against the bills. He doesn’t have breakaway speed but always falls forward, is very shifty and plays an all around solid game.  He does his job.  Knowing coach Flores, he will keep getting snaps and carries."
20380,2020-09-23 23:43:12,iya5rv,Heavily debating playing him over David Johnson this week. 2 weeks in he seems pretty game script proof. Not a lot of TD opportunity but a nice floor for carries and receptions. But like you said he’s gonna get 20% snaps the week I do play him.
20381,2020-09-23 15:15:13,iya5rv,Would you roster him over Henderson or Freeman?
20382,2020-09-23 14:41:38,iya5rv,I can’t get anyone to take him
20383,2020-09-23 16:34:50,iya5rv,"I offered JRob and Hunter Henry to a TE needy team in return for Mixon before week 2

Glad that got declined lol"
20384,2020-09-23 23:42:53,iya5rv,Wow. You really didn’t have faith in your RB1 enough to trade him off? Who are the rest of your RBs then?

When Golladay gets healthy, and Stafford gets settled in, Swift is gonna eat as he gets more involved"
20386,2020-09-23 19:22:07,iya5rv,"Yeah he's been OK, but I have Aaron Jones and 3 must start WR in front of him. I traded Mixon and will start James Robinson for now but I'm ready for Swift to be my RB2"
20387,2020-09-23 23:04:05,iya5rv,J Rob is starting for me with Aaron Jones until Swift gets 15+ touches
20388,2020-09-23 21:03:51,iya5rv,Tell me what? 👻
20389,2020-09-23 20:25:50,iya5rv,"Interesting, I haven't heard that Thurs favours RBs before. Makes sense, though."
20390,2020-09-23 23:19:33,iya5rv,"Really only one true Thursday night game so far. Cin v Cle, which was dominated by Chubb and Hunt."
20391,2020-09-24 07:32:05,iya5rv,"I'm between the same two. Think I'm going with Kelley. One more week to make sure Parker is healthy, and Kelley has a great matchup"
20392,2020-09-23 15:46:09,iya5rv,Why do you think that
20393,2020-09-23 20:23:57,iya5rv,"pretty much every team in the NFL has somewhat of a RBBC, having Lindsay back after a toe injury means that the snap distribution will take a while to get back to 50/50, if it ever comes to that. If you already own MGIII, there is a good chance he shows that he is the lead back rather than relegating back to full on RBBC."

20395,2020-09-23 14:47:32,iya5rv,Thanks for the reply!  That's very encouraging.  He seems like the rare reddit hype train that actually has some steam.
20396,2020-09-23 14:43:32,iya5rv,"Me too, I think it’s a good call. Just make sure you don’t ditch him after only one week when he comes back."
20397,2020-09-23 17:44:10,iya5rv,Time Traveler from 2019 bringing us the information to 2020?
20398,2020-09-23 18:59:32,iya5rv,"This is something that people keep saying on here, but it seems more like a recycled sound bite than anything at this point. That, or a positive affirmation from Mixon owners trying to justify our choice in drafting him.

Given the insane usage of Gio, the offensive line struggles of the Bengals, and the lack of production from Mixon, exactly why should we be expecting a future bounce back?"
20399,2020-09-29 05:58:42,iya5rv,"Gaskin will keep getting better, but Henderson is def beasting now"
20400,2020-09-23 15:44:51,iya5rv,First down I’d assume
20401,2020-09-23 23:54:02,iya5rv,He’s just preparing for the 2023 season when Miami is underwater.
20402,2020-09-24 17:02:02,iya5rv,1 PPFD 0 PPR is even better in my opinion
20403,2020-09-23 21:05:09,iya5rv,I’m avoiding Giants RBs like the plague. The only RB that I trusted behind that line was Barkley.
20404,2020-09-23 15:20:11,iya5rv,"Personally I can't give you a stat based answer on this one. I haven't seen henderson play much but with Cam Akers day to day with ""ribs"" it probably means at least one broken. He'll certainly see an uptick in usage this week. As for Freeman, I've never been a fan and have always tried to avoid him in drafts"
20405,2020-09-23 16:27:52,iya5rv,Lower your standards. I traded Zack Moss and Singletary to get him in my league. Josh Allen’s the RB1 in that RBBC so it was worth a flyer on an elite RB with a decent pass game. Downside to Mixon is his awful offensive line and a terrible Cincy defense that puts them in a position to play from behind and throw almost every game. I’ll take the risk over guessing which Buffalo RB is worth starting each week.
20406,2020-09-24 01:03:49,iya5rv,"Aaron Jones, James Robinson (starting UFN) and Swift."
20407,2020-09-23 20:14:40,iya5rv,What was your Mixon trade?
20408,2020-09-23 23:36:43,iya5rv,You are a beautiful person
20409,2020-09-24 01:53:49,iya5rv,"Yeah that's a fair point, first game had tons of prep time."
20410,2020-09-23 15:55:56,iya5rv,"Lynn has historically used a 1A/1B tandem. One scatback/receiving back and one goal line/powerback. 

He's completely slotted Kelley into the Melvin role. When Melvin was there, JJ only got work as a change of pace guy or when Melvin was injured.

I figure it'll be the same. I also hope it will be the same."
20411,2020-09-23 21:49:23,iya5rv,I'm starting all 3 of them as well
20412,2020-09-23 14:44:14,iya5rv,"My team name is Dumpster Fire so I have plenty of bench spots for him, haha."
20413,2020-09-23 22:22:25,iya5rv,"Because bruising backs seem to find greater success in the later half, whether it be games or seasons. Watch, come week 10 many defenses will be patchwork defenses and worn down from the season. This is when Mixon, Henry, Ingram, Zeke, and the like will feast."
20414,2020-09-23 16:29:51,iya5rv,"I have Hunt, Gibson and freeman on the bench so I might have to play matchup, but I tried him and hunt and him and kupp for other rb got nothing"
20415,2020-09-24 01:06:59,iya5rv,You feel confident that James Robinson will make up for Mixon this season?
20416,2020-09-23 21:03:36,iya5rv,I sent Mixon and Cook for Kittle
20417,2020-09-24 01:04:14,iya5rv,He's already a RB2?
20418,2020-09-23 17:58:02,iya5rv,Yea but when Melvin wasn't there JJ was slotted into the role that Kelley is in now
20419,2020-09-23 14:49:25,iya5rv,"lmao, that was one of my team names a few years back as well."
20420,2020-09-23 16:37:17,iya5rv,"It’s tough making these decisions man.. I lost CMC so needed to find a valid replacement. Depending on your depth though. You could wait it out a few weeks with Mixon and hope that his value climbs or another big RB goes down and someone in your league needs him. It’s hard to believe that Mixon can get much worse at this point. If you do hold him, I would consider handcuffing with Gio just for his presence in the pass game should Mixon go down."
20421,2020-09-24 02:16:07,iya5rv,"With the trade off of starting Robinson and Little over Mixon and Cook, yeah, for my team I think it's worth"
20422,2020-09-23 16:40:22,iya5rv,"The worst two players on my bench are freeman and Gibson it’s hard to drop 1 of them, rest of my bench is kupp, Edelman, Hunt"

Oh, and Pavs is a fucking deflection machine, I was disappointed we didn’t get him last summer.

Thanks for this awesome write-up! Go Bolts! ⚡️"

Until then: Welcome, bro, grab a beer!"

20435,2020-09-22 21:48:27,ixuekv,I’m pretty excited to read this once I have some downtime. I don’t know much about the stars so this will be good. Thank you very much for taking the time to write this up! I still hope you lose. ;)
20436,2020-09-22 21:51:47,ixuekv,"For what it's worth, the Stars were my go-to team when I play NHL 20 online until I hit a bit of a skid and decided to shake things up a bit.

I appreciate you taking the time to do this.

I've seen a discussion on another forum I frequent about whether or not Dallas' old logo and colors are better than what they currently wear.  I think the colors and logo are far-and-away better and that Victory green (didn't know it was called that until your post) is the best shade of green in pro sports.  What's the general opinion of Stars fans?

I've done little more than poke my head into the GDT's but it seems like our two fanbases get a long a bit better than we did with CBJ, BOS, or NYI fans."
20437,2020-09-23 00:43:48,ixuekv,"You're a real one, thanks for the good read. Honestly I can't hate Dallas even if they win the cup because I am a huge supporter of southern hockey whether it be in Florida or beyond"
20438,2020-09-23 00:49:30,ixuekv,"Could you tell me more about Perry? I know a lot of people love to hate on him, especially after all the shit he did as a Duck (from what I read from old Reddit threads). But I've been lead to believe that his play has mellowed out since then, is that true? (I haven't been following hockey for that long so I've been playing the long game of catch up). I was debating between getting a Radulov or Perry jersey - as to why I'm asking haha. I just love players who play the ""pest"" role, I think they're entertaining as all hell, provided nobody gets too hurt. I've seen some footage of Perry being a huge asshole on the Ducks but if he really did tone down his play as a Star, I just might get his name on a jersey. (Also I haven't been able to find a lot of threads discussing Perry on the Stars either, so I'm curious)

(Also Hedman tripping Perry in the last game, lmao it's the funniest shit ever to me haha)"

20445,2020-09-22 19:48:09,ixuekv,"Haha! I know! I had family in the DFW area for a long time owning ""adult establishments"" and drag racing strips. They have told me Pantera were regulars in the 90's. They would tell me that they were always really awesome people to their people.

When my wife took me to a Habs/Stars game (I went in wearing a Habs hat), I heard the song and I was like..""fuck, what is that jam???!!"""
20446,2020-09-22 20:15:59,ixuekv,Any time man! Thank you for the inspiration!!!
20447,2020-09-22 20:21:47,ixuekv,"I get it! He really toes the line with his entire leg doesn't he? I didn't like what he said about the Sedin brothers back in the day, he can come off as a dick, so trust me...I get it. But I like the way he plays and the boys really love playing for him. 

I was surprised that Pavs came to Dallas too when I learned it was between the two of our cities. Frisco is really nice and all but I thought for sure he was going to Tampa. Fuck, I live in Savannah GA and want to move to Tampa haha."
20448,2020-09-23 00:48:30,ixuekv,"Haha thank you!! I worked that line a bit... Almost followed it up with a ""a somewhat flaccid PK"" but didn't like the way it works with the composition. I. Not a coming in peace fan either and that's why I suggested a handshake thread, to funnel all those. Glad my sub took the suggestion.

Cheers to a good series, bro!"

As far as colors, yeah. I would say that we generally live the colors and the uniform. Really lived the WC uniform with the orange/brown.....fire."
20457,2020-09-23 01:09:39,ixuekv,"Sure cool! Yeah. Perry comes with his reputation. There was an overwhelming sense of doom when we learned that he was picked up by Dallas over on the subreddit. Being a pest is one thing - being a pest in the western conference (as a western conference team) is another. Our team's leadership was adamant that they were happy that he was on the team because they wouldn't have to face him. But when it came to production - he is not able to achieve what he did when he was younger. He has slowed down a bit and has not been as bad as he once was (according to youtube videos). His antics now are mostly toeing the line as a pest and not so real dick moves (IMO). He used to be a 30 goal scorer on top of that, but that hasn't translated through the years - especially with the Stars' system. His role with the Stars has been mostly the veteran winger to provide experience. He came at a basement rate as he was needing to have a recovery year. If you want to get a pest from the west jersey, you could get a Perry, but Radulov is the better jersey IMO. He's not so much of a pest as he is an emotional player who pests the shit of out of people (if that makes sense, haha). 

And yeah, Hedman tripping Perry before the faceoff made most of us laugh. Shit acting right there."
20458,2020-09-23 00:57:00,ixuekv,"Thank you! Yeah, I didn't realize how different each horn was until this past year. What is the EASHL??"

20460,2020-09-22 22:00:08,ixuekv,See the first paragraph. Life is too rough right now to add negativity. A dude from your sub posted theirs on ours. It's in good spirits.
20461,2020-09-22 23:33:04,ixuekv,Don't be that guy.
20462,2020-09-23 08:19:35,ixuekv,"Yeah man i hate this shit too. You'll see our fans go into their sub and kiss ass for some karma. Thats one thing i like about the Boston sub is they downvote all the ""FaN cOmInG iN pEaCe"" shit into oblivion. These kids are soft."
20463,2020-09-23 17:08:45,ixuekv,Still not sure if coop is playing with everyone's hearts to muddy your scout's jobs or if there's a chance.  Not sure he'll get a free shift to say he played or not.  Doesn't make sense to me for the SCF.
20464,2020-09-23 04:50:30,ixuekv,"Thanks for all this! It's a little sad to hear that he has slowed down. At least, on the flip side, curbed the worst of his bad antics. Your description of Radulov reminds me of what I see from Gallagher in the Habs (I am primarily a Habs fan). Radulov is also the player that a lot of Habs fans have been gushing about and the main reason why a lot of them are rooting for Dallas. (Apparently he used to play for the Habs?) I didn't know much about him so I couldn't exactly join in haha. Thank you again for telling me all this! I will definitely be keeping an eye out for him in future games :D"
20465,2020-09-23 02:36:10,ixuekv,"Yea theres a lot of unique ones, IMO Dallas and Buffalo are at least top 5 atmospheric goal horns. & it's EA Sports hockey league, the basic online ladder for NHL 20"

20470,2020-09-23 12:18:35,ixuekv,Haha. I get it. It isn't sexy or as exciting to watch as a north/south game. We are all dealt a hand of cards to play with. Not all hands are the same.

20472,2020-09-23 17:16:34,ixuekv,"Personally I think the timing was terrible but it's affect on Point had been massive.  I knew the kid was good, but the dekes he pulls off and getting career defenders to trip and run into each other  like little leaguers is astounding.  You rarely saw it out of him before this post season, and I feel some of that was being in the shadow of Kucherov/Stamkos."

Let me spell this out to you since I'm definitely leaning towards you actually being this stupid and not just pretending:

You threw a fit like a toddler.  In response I spoke to you like you were a toddler.  That's not my normal conversation technique it's intentionally mocking you for your shitty behavior. 

Now if you see it in the future you can know what's going on.  Knowing is half the battle, champ. :)"
20483,2020-09-23 20:33:34,ixuekv, And people aren't entitled to their own opinions? I was agreeing with what someone said. And I have no doubt you talk like that often. You added nothing to the conversation but your mocking toddler tirade because you were fishing for karma. I have an idea. I heard theres a BLM protest in St.Pete. Why dont you throw on your MAGA hat and rally the trailer park and go crash it. You'll be about as useful there as you are here.

Too bad you can't cite your own right to an opinion without giving me the same right. :("

20503,2020-09-22 03:09:14,ixf9ly,"Gg, Tampa. Shame we put ourselves in a shitty situation early. Could've been a different story tonight, but that's how she goes sometimes.

Should be a good series."

When did Dallas become a good team? In my head Dallas was always a perpetual Bridesmaid.

More 5 on 5 hockey plz!"
20510,2020-09-22 02:59:26,ixf9ly,"Tampa came out and played their game. Not stoked that Coop pulled back on the aggression in the first half of the third, but they won out. Killer had a monstrous first period.

Dallas looked great in the third. Curious to see how this game would have shook out if the penalties settled down; but I get the refs wanting to get control of things as the game went on."
20511,2020-09-22 03:01:04,ixf9ly,I dont think there is a team worse at getting empty netters than Tampa.
20512,2020-09-22 02:57:13,ixf9ly,Tampa almost fucked themselves by backing off with the lead but they were able to correct themselves and started playing just aggressive enough to stop the Stars from getting the game tying goal.
20513,2020-09-22 03:00:02,ixf9ly,"Fuck, I’ll take a split of the first two. Now it’s time to utilize the last change boys.

Also, if we could stop putting the puck into our own net, that’d be great"

20516,2020-09-22 03:01:46,ixf9ly,"Great game, Dallas has a hell of a team and this one could easily go to 7. Gonna be physical as hell but this has got to be a ton of fun to watch as a neutral fan. A little more ohh God ohh God I'm gonna die as a die hard fan lol"
20517,2020-09-22 03:11:16,ixf9ly,This is going 7. Possibly with OT and only black aces playing after everyone is injured.

This was on the NBCSN app in the DFW market, for the record. This covers the period starting with the ads immediately before the game started and immediately after the game ended.

Some observations:

* They really front-loaded the Lexus ads. It played several times during the 1st and 2nd period, then not at all during the 3rd that I remember.
* A good portion of the 1-offs were during the period breaks. I noticed I added at least 10 new ads in the second period break alone. It was a pack of 9 ads, a very short ""you've been watching the Stanley Cup Final on NBC"" bumper, then 7 more ads.

That's all for me folks, the other guy said he'd be back for Game 3, and I think my wife was getting annoyed by the end."
20528,2020-09-22 03:04:35,ixf9ly,"GG Tampa. Dallas needs to stay out of the damn box. It has been the most frustrating thing with them during these playoffs. They take dumb penalty after dumb penalty. Looking like we have a good series on our hands, see ya Weds!

Obligatory screw the refs."

20531,2020-09-22 03:12:41,ixf9ly,"GG. Lightning showed up to play and had an extra step early. Power play finally showed up. Got to stop taking penalties on our end. Dallas will be tough the whole way through the eest of the series. 

On to game 3."
20532,2020-09-22 03:00:00,ixf9ly,Its staggering how little people seem to care about the Cup finals compared to the NBA.

But for any Tampa fan that wants to discuss hockey,  how many of your players are entering free agency next year? It crazy how many good players you either got from other teams or possibly reviews a few careers."
20550,2020-09-22 04:54:32,ixf9ly,"Imagine if that off-side that got the goal turned over ended up losing Tampa the game. It was one of the worst off-sides I've seen. At least fucking try to avoid it, Coleman."

20553,2020-09-22 02:59:13,ixf9ly,Way closer than it should’ve been.

20555,2020-09-22 03:07:10,ixf9ly,"I thought the pavelski penalty was iffy, if stars can stay out of the box they would be fine. Oleksiak is an idiot it’s the Stanley cup final ffs. Tampa looked a little weary it will be interesting to see how they are in the back to back games. 

Reffing is just so dam inconsistent, it wasn’t just calls but there were some missed icings and offsides."
20556,2020-09-22 02:56:46,ixf9ly,Fuck dead puck hockey. Good job Tampa.

I say this all the time but I know I can guess what is holding or pass interference with about 90% accuracy but when it comes to the NHL playoffs it's an absolute crapshoot. And that is a real difficult thing to get over!

20570,2020-09-22 03:04:17,ixf9ly,"I think the second game will just be a snooze fest. Low energy, not much after the whistle, 1-0 / 2-1 game."

20577,2020-09-22 10:41:32,ixf9ly,I've been thinking this since the Conference Finals. Do you think it's the ice or something to do with the balance of the puck since they put that tracker in there?

20621,2020-09-22 03:13:06,ixf9ly,"Hey bud, we, uh, traded a couple of firsts this season."
20622,2020-09-22 03:00:39,ixf9ly,"I honestly think they’ve underperformed for a few years now, but no one realized it. The roster seems much better than they’ve played, and now they’re finally showing it off"
20623,2020-09-22 03:09:18,ixf9ly,"They took the cup champs to OT in game 7 last year. They have had top 5 defense last two seasons, and Dobby lead the league in save % this season. It’s not really new, but adding in Pavs and Perry, and having a healthy Oleksiak definitely helps

Edit: also helps to have this Kiviranta guy"
20624,2020-09-22 03:02:45,ixf9ly,"Late October 2019 they went on a roll. Few hiccups since, but really been clicking for a while."
20625,2020-09-22 03:00:14,ixf9ly,This playoffs. They have a good system structure and 100% buy in. They play as a team.
20626,2020-09-22 03:02:52,ixf9ly,Really came together end of last season. Took the blues to OT in game 7. Continued being good this year (except some horrific 10 game stretches).
20627,2020-09-22 03:04:16,ixf9ly,"They have been slowly putting together a team for a few years and I have been saying they are getting good. Once they found the right coach. 

You guys better take the interim tag off him and pay that man"
20628,2020-09-22 03:02:16,ixf9ly,Always had a strong top line. Got some seriously good depth players and the d can skate. They are solid.
20629,2020-09-22 03:23:04,ixf9ly,I thought Dallas would go further than they did the last 2-3 years. I had Tampa v Dallas in the finals last year (something something broom).
20630,2020-09-22 03:12:43,ixf9ly,"When they realized that you're supposed to shoot the puck *into* the net.

No but seriously, they've been pretty good defensively for a few years now. I think it's mostly that they've been employing a more aggressive defense and have finally been able to put together their offense."
20631,2020-09-22 03:06:44,ixf9ly,"Agreed. Refs are missing obvious calls on both teams, and calling made up ones on both teams. Honestly don't know if it favored either team but would.prefer they were consistent"
20632,2020-09-22 03:04:08,ixf9ly,Game would have probably looked a lot like the 3rd period when the refs swallowed their whistles. I think we're in for a good back and forth series.
20633,2020-09-22 04:28:13,ixf9ly,"> I get the refs wanting to get control of things as the game went on.

But they called less penalties as the game went on?"
20634,2020-09-22 06:14:07,ixf9ly,Good game bro. Glad it ended up being a fun one
20635,2020-09-22 16:41:20,ixf9ly,Don’t think they pulled back on the aggression. They were in the penalty box for 9 minutes of the 20 minutes in the second period. Pretty hard to go anywhere like that.
20636,2020-09-22 03:02:37,ixf9ly,Dallas has entered the chat
20637,2020-09-22 03:02:22,ixf9ly,If you think that’s bad you should see us in 4-on-4.
20638,2020-09-22 03:15:09,ixf9ly,There was a clear switch after you guys put up that second goal. They were much better neutral ice. I don't think y'all had but a couple more SOG in those final 10~ minutes.
20639,2020-09-22 03:05:32,ixf9ly,Vasy usually makes enough big saves when we back off a bit for some reason until we decide to get our ass in gear again.
20640,2020-09-22 02:59:44,ixf9ly,They ride their goaltender cause he’s good af could have been a lot different if anyone else was in goal
20641,2020-09-22 15:35:54,ixf9ly,"Seriously, the Bolts could not have competed or won that game last year."

20644,2020-09-22 02:58:30,ixf9ly,The 3rd was great when they stopped calling everything
20645,2020-09-22 02:57:54,ixf9ly,"Dallas needs to stay out of the box, a bigger deal now that Tampa has their PP together"

Ufas are maroon, shattenkirk, bogosian


Just off the top of my head. Theyll need to trade killorn and figure out how to unload one of palat, johnson, or gourde (all have ntc) to re-sign the rfas. Gonna be tough, but thats a worry for October"
20656,2020-09-22 04:11:06,ixf9ly,"Forwards:

Cirelli, Verhaeghe and Stephens are all RFAs. Cirelli will eat some space but the other two are replaceable. 

Pat Maroon is a UFA but I don't really think we'll miss him.

Defenseman :
Cernak, Sergy RFAs

Shatty, Bogosian, Schenn, Rutta are all UFAs.

Definitely going to lose some of them but the anchors are still there. We're pretty tight on cap space depending on how the expansion draft goes. 

Definitely going to be a different supporting cast, but between Yzerman' s groundwork and Bries Bois decisions so far I'm pretty confident we'll be contenders next year."
20657,2020-09-22 05:20:22,ixf9ly,You must have missed the one when we were playing the Islanders when Verhage scored but Paquette was like 20 feet offside. I mean Steve Wonder could have made the call in real time
20658,2020-09-22 06:10:31,ixf9ly,"Yeah, I saw it real time; I'm like, yeah, no, that's coming back.  The one vs Isles was worse tho; Verhaeghe scored with Paquette like 5 or 10 feet past the line.  In interview after he said he was happy at first, then Paquette came up to him and told him it was likely coming back, cuz he was offside.

Bolts had several other offside calls tonite, where no goal was scored, but took away some what could have been good opportunities.  They need to get their shit together with that."
20659,2020-09-22 05:23:08,ixf9ly,"Yeah, no effort to straddle the line. I can't imagine losing a near must-win game your team would have iced if not for your bone-headed mistake."
20660,2020-09-22 14:54:40,ixf9ly,The Linesmen have been pretty bad. I could see that shit was offside laying in my bed but the linesman is literally right there on the ice mere feet away from the play and he misses it. There was an even worse one a few games ago. The momentum shift from these kinds of calls can be huge. It's also like we aren't even trying to stay onside either lmao.
20661,2020-09-22 05:18:05,ixf9ly,They have been consistently bad
20662,2020-09-22 03:10:19,ixf9ly,Imagine of the stars gameplan wasn’t trying to injure bolts players..
20663,2020-09-22 03:08:54,ixf9ly,"He obviously isn't right, but he is making an impact in other areas of the game, winning faceoffs, killing penalties, and doing some great work on the back check.  He is playing hurt and obviously isn't producing offensively, but I don't think you end up with a net gain sitting him down for Justin Dowling."
20664,2020-09-22 04:31:59,ixf9ly,Rumor has it that he’s playing hurt. But he’s still a presence on the ice and is great defensively. Scratching one of the faces of your franchise in the finals for...who? Yeah that makes sense.
20665,2020-09-22 15:27:56,ixf9ly,"It’s weird because he honestly doesn’t look bad for somebody not producing, I noticed him have a lot of good looks in that game and it just wouldn’t go in"
20666,2020-09-22 03:13:07,ixf9ly,"He may not be showing up on the scoreboard like he should be, but he’s been rock solid defensively and making good plays in the offensive zone. He is playing like the top line forward. Just snake bit right now. 

And beyond that, who would you scratch him for? Our best defensive center in Faksa is out, and Comeau looks like he might be out too. I think Seguin is due for a big game. Hopefully it comes sooner rather than later."
20667,2020-09-22 14:48:41,ixf9ly,But you didn't though.
20668,2020-09-22 03:05:28,ixf9ly,Tampa could say the same about the second. Was a hell of a game by both teams and awful officiating. Just inconsistent for both teams
20669,2020-09-22 15:29:12,ixf9ly,You realize your first goal of the game cake immediately after a slashing call on Tampa where there was clearly nothing even resembling a slash committed right?
20670,2020-09-22 03:17:15,ixf9ly,"Yeah, you only need one good period to beat the Stars."
20671,2020-09-22 05:22:51,ixf9ly,"Of course we are chirping more after a win then a 4-1 loss. Hard to chirp too much after that.

20672,2020-09-22 05:53:04,ixf9ly,"I don’t think any actual hockey fan would expect an “easy win” in this sport, especially when the Stanley Cup is involved. People get complacent for sure but nobody doubts that Dallas is a hell of a team."
20673,2020-09-22 02:59:37,ixf9ly,Lol what a bitch.
20674,2020-09-22 03:14:44,ixf9ly,We watched a different game I guess. More shots than Dallas in the third and we basically played in your half of the ice for 90% of the time after you made it 3-2
20675,2020-09-22 14:36:47,ixf9ly,It was a dive. Totally dive. He dove. Everyone saw it. You can't call that!

20679,2020-09-22 16:50:16,ixf9ly,Nah. Pretty sure Bishop will rush him and they'll both collapse to the ice.
20680,2020-09-22 03:23:03,ixf9ly,"I predict the exact opposite. Tired guys taking shortcuts and liberties to gain an edge. I think Game 5 will be worse than Game 4, maybe the ugliest of the series."
20681,2020-09-22 03:35:17,ixf9ly,"I think it entirely depends on the series count. If one team is up 3-1 it’s gonna be a wild game. If it’s 2-2, yeah a snore fest"

20699,2020-09-22 18:44:25,ixf9ly,Lots of diamonds would have been made in Tampa.
20700,2020-09-22 03:27:33,ixf9ly,Because the refs feel like they have to control the game instead of just calling penalties. And then they fuck up and get in this spiral of make up calls or no calls. Or let stuff go because “playoffs” and then turn around and call a softy on the other team. It always turns into a shit show where nobody is happy. If refs just called penalties and stopped worrying about all the extra bullshit it would be fine.
20701,2020-09-22 03:00:13,ixf9ly,I'd take the 0 penalties over the shitshow that was the first 2 periods of officiating.

20703,2020-09-22 18:49:14,ixf9ly,I'll take some calls in the playoffs like it has been this year than 0-3 total calls a game usually. I hate that the sport has to change so drastically and let interference go every play. That being said it was a Shitshow of refing last night. Consistency is needed for sure.
20704,2020-09-22 03:00:05,ixf9ly,"If both teams think the refs are against them, it's probably evenly shitty.

If both teams think NBC is shit and calling against them, it's because it's NBC, what the hell did you expect"

But like, never even a sniff.

Something changed and they are killing it"
20720,2020-09-22 04:58:10,ixf9ly,"To me the real crazy story is that they are three wins away from the cup and their supposed 1C has been absolutely terrible. Seguin has 2 goals and 6 assists in 22 games. Even Radulov and Benn have been just good, not great, as star players. I knew they were more of a defensive team with amazing goaltending, but I would not have thought they could have made it this far without their top guys going supernova. Their depth has really stepped up with some timely goals, and Heiskanen and Klingberg are completely balling out."
20721,2020-09-22 04:58:55,ixf9ly,"But the top line hasn't even been that amazing, which makes this crazier."
20722,2020-09-22 03:08:39,ixf9ly,"Yeah it was kinda just frustrating for everybody, don’t think it really leaned one way or the other but it definitely took all of the wind out of the game"

20726,2020-09-22 15:44:23,ixf9ly,"Hey, that's my line.

Two years ago, or was it three?... Our 5 on 4 was horrible, with great players....   Anytime we got a PP I had to pray for no Shorty.... When we would begin to press and get momentum, teams would take a penalty just to watch the life get sucked out of our squad."
20727,2020-09-22 03:17:56,ixf9ly,Yeah after the 2nd goal y'all start attacking more which stopped Dallas' aggressive play. So far in the playoffs y'all are the only ones who have been able to stop that slide once it starts.
20728,2020-09-22 03:02:18,ixf9ly,We wouldnt be where we are now with anyone else in goal lol

20734,2020-09-22 03:00:05,ixf9ly,Not to mention if Stamkos does play even in a limited role that PP becomes lethal
20735,2020-09-22 03:01:46,ixf9ly,Its about time we had a firm grasp of our PP
20736,2020-09-22 03:16:47,ixf9ly,This 100%

20738,2020-09-22 15:42:23,ixf9ly,And for yours.
20739,2020-09-22 05:16:02,ixf9ly,"Agree. Both sides have idiots of course but that's because they are on the internet. Guarantee half of them have never been to a live game and if they have wouldn't be the keyboard warrior in real life.

Chirpin is fun and is part of hockey, but the whiney shit gets old so fast. Overall I've enjoyed most Dallas Fans and while I wish you could would stop murdering Point and Kuch, that would not be smart hockey lol.

That being said, I've heard Dallas Fans like there steaks well done with ketchup!"
20740,2020-09-22 15:47:23,ixf9ly,Klinger heeled that so bad.... Thought he was wrestling.
20741,2020-09-22 14:57:18,ixf9ly,USF getting blown out and UCF beating Georgia Tech was the bright spot of my Saturday.
20742,2020-09-22 03:01:50,ixf9ly,"They love their leads and the number 3.

2013: Blew a 3 goal lead (4-1) in Game 7

2018: Blew three one-goal leads in Game 7

2019: Blew three one-game leads in the series"
20743,2020-09-22 06:31:03,ixf9ly,"Haha there have definitely been more blatant offsides but the reason I think this one is so bad is because it's blatant enough, yet totally avoidable through the entire sequence. Coleman can just extend a leg back or slide along the line for a second and they're good. But there wasn't any effort at all to be onside and he wasn't skating full speed to try and get a rebound or anything like that. It was just extremely sloppy by him."
20744,2020-09-22 06:16:18,ixf9ly,We were the only team to lose a player from this game
20745,2020-09-22 03:14:26,ixf9ly,Imagine not shooting pucks intentionally into the other teams bench.
20746,2020-09-22 15:55:50,ixf9ly,Happens much like Kuchs dive in the first in the “high stick” that hit his shoulder and bounced off the side of his helmet. The reffing was questionable for sure.
20747,2020-09-22 03:19:22,ixf9ly,Cute
20748,2020-09-22 06:01:17,ixf9ly,"Oh man, you'd be suprised haha. I chalk it up to the band wagon most of the time. Stars are real bad especially when no football is on...Everything is the goalies fault, no matter what. 

My favorite one I saw was a couple of em saying we needed to ship Miro and Klinger for Karlsson...Maybe it was an account owned by Joe Nieuwendyk?"
20749,2020-09-22 03:16:07,ixf9ly,Peak 2020 shit

20756,2020-09-22 09:05:08,ixf9ly,"We go 12/6 for game 4 and it’s a squeaker, 11/7 for game 5 and Bogo and Schenn come out and just WRECK SHIT, bet"

20758,2020-09-22 03:33:46,ixf9ly,Triplets line was amazing. Fond memories of watching The Joe fall into depression in Game 4
20759,2020-09-22 03:41:09,ixf9ly,Right about the time he and Tyler fkn Johnson sent us to the basement.
20760,2020-09-22 03:31:33,ixf9ly,Is that including round robin?
20761,2020-09-22 05:13:06,ixf9ly,He’s really only had one bad playoff series iirc
20762,2020-09-22 06:24:07,ixf9ly,"Is it? .5 career PPG in the playoffs for a ‘superstar’ making 9+ mil/year.

Part of this is just my own frustration because I know he’s likely hurt, but that seems to be the storyline *every post season*."

20780,2020-09-22 03:03:26,ixf9ly,"Sneaky. They used to be a completely offensive team with no defense or goaltending, and then they formed a filthy d core and vezina caliber goalie. Makes so much sense but we never really saw it happen."
20781,2020-09-22 16:02:04,ixf9ly,"I mean, last year is pretty much the first year we had elite D and fantastic goaltending, and it's not like we flamed out super hard. We took the eventual cup winners to 2OT in game 7."
20782,2020-09-22 06:12:41,ixf9ly,Seguin has not been nearly as bad as the stats suggest. He’s injured as shit and snake bitten
20783,2020-09-22 03:10:28,ixf9ly,"Agreed. I'm glad for the most part both sides have mainly good fans, of course we both have some shit heads but that's the Internet.

Love seeing two teams from the south play out some great hockey for the cup...in September...during football season...2020 is weird"
20784,2020-09-22 16:20:21,ixf9ly,But...Colorado says the Stars are boring...

20789,2020-09-22 03:04:53,ixf9ly,"Seemed to benefit both teams relatively equally too, but made the game much more enjoyable since it was able to flow better"

You’re right that it usually is the bandwagoners but I also believe that a lot of people just don’t watch enough hockey to understand how the sport works. Why they feel the need to stir shit up is beyond me though
20800,2020-09-22 15:20:32,ixf9ly,"Take it from a long time Lightning fan, you don't want to hold onto the cup an extra year because it wasn't awarded the following year.  It doesn't work out.  It's got way too much in common with a horror movie."

20804,2020-09-22 03:37:33,ixf9ly,I'll still take to heart that the Lightning said that the Red Wings were the toughest opponents they faced 2015.
20805,2020-09-22 03:36:35,ixf9ly,"He had two points in the round robin and passed Richards by two points so we can say *technically* he passed him, but really he tied him tonight"
20806,2020-09-22 03:32:52,ixf9ly,"I'll just come out ahead and say I don't know about that, but the NHL counts round the robin towards playoff statistics rather than regular season statistics so I'd wager yes."
20807,2020-09-22 15:25:08,ixf9ly,"Yes, and with round robin Kuch still has 2 less GP than Richards did in 04"
20808,2020-09-22 06:16:15,ixf9ly,"It was two series to be fair. Played incredibly mediocre (along with the rest of the team) vs the Caps in the ECF in '18 and then the series we don't talk about last year. 

If you look at his career though, outside of '19, it's been constant growth. People only remember the final round that a team makes in the playoffs though.

This year he has seemed to turn the corner though regarding his defensive skills and being a playmaker when it matters instead of facilitating pretty goals.

If he can act like a fucking adult instead of a greasy fuck he could probably be the most loved player in our history when he's said and done."
20809,2020-09-22 06:30:10,ixf9ly,"He’s not likely hurt, he is hurt. That wrist injury is still clearly affecting him and his shot is not nearly as strong as it normally is. He had been fantastic on defense though and he has found ways to contribute without scoring the puck. He has also been super snake bit. Vasilevskiy stole a goal from him in game 1. Seguin got to the rebound after Rads hit the post and Vasy was somehow able to put a stick on it"

20817,2020-09-22 07:44:29,ixf9ly,"I get that he might be injured, and he has been unlucky for sure, but I’ve watched probably between a third and half of the Stars games during this run, and it does not seem like he is really driving play to a great degree. He’s not very noticeable. I’ve been watching hockey for about thirty years and I can’t recall a time where a team got this close to a cup getting this little from their 1C."

20833,2020-09-22 06:35:16,ixf9ly,"Yeah I know he got robbed against Vasy. He also got robbed by Lehner last series. He’s snake bit. He’s injured. He’s also a ~29 year old we signed to a massive contract who never shows up in the post season with any consistency.

Call it injury, call it snake bitten, call it bad fucking luck. A career .5 PPG in the playoffs for a **top 10 paid player in the NHL** that’s nearing 30 is a bad fucking look."

20852,2020-11-09 18:17:04,jqzwe3,Looking forward to this.  My opening weekend of the next generation will be playing Astrobot whilst waiting for Bugsnax to download and Bugsnax whilst waiting for Demon’s Souls to download.
20853,2020-11-09 19:23:34,jqzwe3,Incredible. First game in history to only receive 10/10s or 100s. Only Bugsnax could achieve such accomplishment.

20856,2020-11-09 20:00:57,jqzwe3,I think we can all agree based on these reviews that this is pretty much what we expected from a game called Bugsnax
20857,2020-11-09 19:38:05,jqzwe3,"Looks like a neat game for kids, shame about how absolutely atrocious it looks. It reminds me of that old 2007 Xbox360 game Naughty Bear. Which is alarming considering it was two generations ago"
20858,2020-11-09 23:20:30,jqzwe3,I legitimately can’t wait for this game. A sugary sweet relaxing game with a slight undertone of body horror.

20870,2020-11-09 19:16:44,jqzwe3,"From everything I see, it seems to be kind of inspired by Viva Pinata, but it's not *exactly* the same and isn't as good of a game.

So my guess is... probably? Maybe not as much as VP but you will probably enjoy it.

I'm going into it with the same mindset I did for Octodad: it'll be funny and charming but not the greatest game ever."
20871,2020-11-09 16:03:45,jqzwe3,"Fortunately for Cyberpunk it's going to be eligible for next year's GOTY awards, this is also the real reason why they delayed the game, to avoid going up against Bugsnax at all costs."
20872,2020-11-09 19:29:51,jqzwe3,"Only one of these games has a song by Kero Kero Bonito. Checkmate, CDPR"
20873,2020-11-09 16:21:26,jqzwe3,"CDPR sure plan for it to be GOTY, but they are just not sure which year."
20874,2020-11-09 18:24:09,jqzwe3,Nobody's even talking about Cyberpunk. *Everyone's* talkin' 'bout Bugsnax.
20875,2020-11-09 17:20:50,jqzwe3,The new Knack is here
20876,2020-11-09 22:52:09,jqzwe3,Bugsnax makes Knack look like Gex
20877,2020-11-09 21:07:54,jqzwe3,Bugsnax isn't coming out in 2027 so they won't be competing with one another
20878,2020-11-09 17:34:05,jqzwe3,I really like your accessibility checklist at the bottom of your review. That's some really important info to have before making a purchase!
20879,2020-11-09 18:42:47,jqzwe3,"> It’s a lot more than just the meme the internet has taken it for

Sounds par for the course for Young Horses given Octodad, then. Glad to hear it."
20880,2020-11-09 16:02:51,jqzwe3,Thanks for the review!
20881,2020-11-09 23:20:40,jqzwe3,Does this game turn into some dark shit towards the end?

20883,2020-11-09 17:44:35,jqzwe3,"Yuri Lowenthal, he's also Spider-man"
20884,2020-11-09 18:37:34,jqzwe3,I think the first voice I associated to Yuri was Yosuke from Persona 4.
20885,2020-11-09 17:43:38,jqzwe3,Wasn't he Spiderman in the new Spiderman game as well?
20886,2020-11-09 19:00:06,jqzwe3,I fucking love Yuri. He’s such a talented voice actor
20887,2020-11-09 18:44:13,jqzwe3,[removed]
20888,2020-11-09 17:25:40,jqzwe3,It's not up for sale because it's launching for free on PS+
20889,2020-11-09 17:41:56,jqzwe3,It is possible to pre-order a physical version from Fangamer if you're looking for that.
20890,2020-11-09 19:51:22,jqzwe3,Lmao we have the same plan!
20891,2020-11-09 21:26:28,jqzwe3,That sounds like a blast
20892,2020-11-09 22:15:42,jqzwe3,Crazy that we've finally reached peak video game just a few decades into the medium.
20893,2020-11-10 10:36:06,jqzwe3,Um Knack and Knack 2 baby

20895,2020-11-10 04:44:41,jqzwe3,Didn't Sony already sold all there ps5 for the first week?
20896,2020-11-09 22:17:29,jqzwe3,Bugsnax is a great name.
20897,2020-11-10 04:08:43,jqzwe3,Hahah I thought I was the only one who remembers damn Naughty Bear
20898,2020-11-22 04:41:59,jqzwe3,"The game is good, I'm not even joking"
20899,2021-02-12 13:17:05,jqzwe3,"Well... imagine Pokemon Snap, going around photographing the various critters, finding out what makes them tick, what they love, what they fear, etc. (Every Bugsnax even recites their own name over and over again just like a Pokemon does) mixed with a bit of Ape Escape (Figuring out how to catch each Snax is like a mini puzzle, at the start of the game it's as easy as waiting for them to walk into your traps path and trigger it when they walk over it, but it gets really complex later on. It's also filled with great characters with real emotional value, don't let it's kiddy exterior fool you, it gets real deep sometimes."
20900,2020-11-09 16:21:27,jqzwe3,"Different strokes for different people. Some people may value the characters and situations, while for others the gameplay might be more important. I think it's perfectly fine for them to point it out, so people has enough different views to figure out whether or not it might be for them."
20901,2020-11-09 16:20:03,jqzwe3,[deleted]
20902,2020-11-09 16:30:29,jqzwe3,If the gameplay isn't fun its certainly something fair to hold against in a **game** review.
20903,2020-11-09 16:41:40,jqzwe3,I'm not sure why your view is more valid than other people who may value gameplay as the top priority in a game.
20904,2020-11-09 16:58:02,jqzwe3,"*For you*, maybe a game with mediocre gameplay and excellent everything else is a 9, but *for me* it's a 7.

That seems to be exactly how these reviews stack up."
20905,2020-11-09 17:08:45,jqzwe3,I can't really believe we are at a point where not liking the gameplay of a game is somehow a controversial thing to criticise a game about
20906,2020-11-09 16:51:32,jqzwe3,"If a video game is not fun to play, it's not a good video game."
20907,2020-11-09 16:20:24,jqzwe3,"Yeah, plus when I saw the ribs snax in the trailer I fucking lost it. I will spend hours just observing the bugsnax lmao"
20908,2020-11-09 16:35:47,jqzwe3,Any review with a number at the end isn't going to be a great way to review a game but here we are.
20909,2020-11-09 21:06:54,jqzwe3,"Oh boy. I can't wait for the post-launch articles on this one clogging up my news and social media feeds.

""We Need To Talk About Bugsnax"""
20910,2020-11-09 23:23:22,jqzwe3,">!S... Spec Ops?!<

Do I have to play Bugsnax now?"
20911,2020-11-09 18:50:20,jqzwe3,Now I want to know what that big turnaround is o.o
20912,2020-11-09 18:08:16,jqzwe3,[deleted]
20913,2020-11-10 11:14:34,jqzwe3,"Can you spoil the whole experience for me? My friends kept linking/playing the bugsnax song to the point where I kinda despised the game without knowing anything about it, so I will never play it but now I'm at least interested to know whats ""spec ops like"" about it."
20914,2020-11-09 20:25:55,jqzwe3,Feels like the twist is obvious now that I have this information...Should not have clicked.
20915,2020-11-10 09:59:10,jqzwe3,"Holy fuck, ""The dark (and very real) lore of bugsnax"" youtube video by backseat is actually on point. It was made satire, to compare Bugsnax to Bloodborne but now it doesn't seem out of place lol"
20916,2020-11-09 20:39:19,jqzwe3,"Just want to point out that >!in The Last of Us 2 you aren't the one being punished for what you did all along. The game isn't telling the player they did something wrong because the player didn't have a choice. Spec Ops did tell the player that as a cheap ploy, but in TLoU2 it's just the decisions of the character and in no way is the game saying the player is complicit in their actions any more than Uncharted 4 calls the player a bad boyfriend since Nate lied to Elena. The Last of Us and Uncharted aren't games where the player takes part in the story, they simply play through it in the same way a moviegoer watches a movie. The interactive aspects of the game may enhance the emotions of the story, but they aren't meant to reflect anything onto the player. !<"
20917,2020-11-09 16:41:46,jqzwe3,"If you're talking about IGN's review, they mentioned that it *tackles* themes like mental health and climate change -- like most kid shows on television. Adventure Time tackles eldritch horror but it's not a secret horror series.

The game is rated for kids and deals with the darker subject matter in a way that kids will understand and absorb. That's all there really is to it."
20918,2020-11-09 23:24:37,jqzwe3,Just read the review and it in no way do they imply dark shit. They say there’s a wild twist but personally what I take from what they are saying is just something wacky. Nothing sinister about what they said.
20919,2020-11-10 17:58:56,jqzwe3,Game theory will give a copy of Bugsnax to the pope
20920,2020-11-09 16:05:13,jqzwe3,"The rating is for kids. There's no way there would be anything dark with that rating. Unless the board also missed it completely, which is unlikely."
20921,2020-11-09 20:05:48,jqzwe3,Professional reviewers are often given the game weeks in advance so they can submit their review on launch day
20922,2020-11-09 20:18:13,jqzwe3,I've finished the game if you have any questions.
20923,2020-11-09 16:09:47,jqzwe3,[removed]
20924,2020-11-09 16:53:27,jqzwe3,Drastic measures have been taken.

20926,2020-11-09 22:12:35,jqzwe3,Run The Jewels though. Competition is fierce.

Next year, who knows how fierce the competition will be. I'm banking on a quick sequel to Bugsnax"
20929,2020-11-09 21:14:04,jqzwe3,Star Cyberpunk
20930,2020-11-09 18:39:04,jqzwe3,2077 it is in the title.
20931,2020-11-09 19:15:34,jqzwe3,If it's going to be anything like Witcher 3 then it's going to be nominated for game awards for the next 5 years for some mind boggling reason.
20932,2020-11-09 20:54:08,jqzwe3,I sincerely hope more reviewers and critics start using that or something similar.
20933,2020-11-10 15:11:30,jqzwe3,"Thanks for the feedback, will work on that for the next one!"
20934,2020-11-09 18:18:33,jqzwe3,He's also [someone](https://i.imgur.com/JcfivyT.png) you kill a whole bunch of times in HITMAN.
20935,2020-11-09 21:35:26,jqzwe3,"Also one of the most prolific games voice actors in general, his roles are far too many to name."
20936,2020-11-09 23:39:55,jqzwe3,He's also the Prince of Persia!
20937,2020-11-09 17:47:34,jqzwe3,"Yes, and Ben ten."
20938,2020-11-09 18:19:22,jqzwe3,"From what I saw in the voice actor trailer, there are actually 3 Spider-Man voice actors in this game: Yuri Lowenthal (Spider-Man PS4), Robbie Daymond (the recent animated series), and Sam Riegel (the Amazing Spider-Man games)."
20939,2020-11-09 20:54:37,jqzwe3,"The only things I know him from are Sunset Overdrive and Spider-Man. And as a lifelong Spider-Man fan, I can honestly say he’s the best voice I’ve ever heard for that character. I absolutely loved his performance."
20940,2020-11-09 18:59:51,jqzwe3,"I love the Naruto dub, but it’s also what I grew up watching so I have nostalgic ties to it. But setting those aside, I think the majority of the cast is fantastic"
20941,2020-11-09 21:22:46,jqzwe3,"Exact opposite for me. I lose a tonne of immersion when male characters are obviously voiced by a woman.  Japanese Goku, Japanese Ashe Ketchum, Japanese Naruto.

But then you have English dub ashe ketchum which is also done by a woman but actually sounds like a 12 year old boy to me.

This is the only thing that bothers me.  Look at Ruroni Kenshin.  Voiced by a woman in the Japanese version and is phenomenal.  The effeminate voice is literally a part of the ""soft-ness"" of the character.  Yes, usually the emotion and dialogue is better, lip syncing is better, but if I can't engage with the MC then none of that matters.

Oh and Guy sensei and Rock Lee are infinitely better characters in the dub and I will fight anyone on that"
20942,2020-11-09 18:34:04,jqzwe3,"Not entirely, only if you play on PS5. PS4 still has to pay (the PS+ copy doesn't transfer from what's been stated) and PC obviously as well doesn't come with it lol."
20943,2020-11-09 17:40:01,jqzwe3,"Ooooh. How big is it? I typically can't download games digitally or download large updates. I live in rural US, so my internet practically doesn't exist."
20944,2020-11-09 18:38:17,jqzwe3,As someone running out of money this is great lol. I do actually want to try this out.
20945,2020-11-09 22:18:42,jqzwe3,Only for PS5 is it free with PS+ https://blog.playstation.com/2020/10/28/bugsnax-free-at-launch-on-ps5-for-ps-plus-members/
20946,2020-11-10 12:40:18,jqzwe3,PS+ is definitely not free.
20947,2020-11-09 17:58:41,jqzwe3,This guy gets it
20948,2020-11-09 22:18:23,jqzwe3,"Shh, you're lowering my chances."
20949,2020-11-10 04:49:07,jqzwe3,"Apparently some places are going to have online orders open for pick up, like Walmart and Target."
20950,2020-11-09 17:03:05,jqzwe3,"I think that's the reason it's important to find a reviewer who aligns with why you enjoy video games.  I've seen reviewers fawn over things in a game I couldn't care less about and brush past my favorite aspects of games.

Or just read a few different reviews until you get a feel for if the flaws are a deal breaker for you.  Either way, it's better than looking at aggregates of everyone and trying to take anything meaningful away from it."

20952,2020-11-09 16:34:13,jqzwe3,"I understand what you mean, but Animal Crossing got pretty great reviews despite having pretty limited gameplay. People play that game more for the characters and collecting, and I see this game sort of the same way."
20953,2020-11-09 16:39:06,jqzwe3,[deleted]
20954,2020-11-09 19:38:55,jqzwe3,"Agreed, and I feel like the best example of this is Death Stranding. It had such a cool aesthetic and original ideas, but the game was awful to play IMO."
20955,2020-11-09 19:54:56,jqzwe3,"As I understand it, his view is that both should be considered as avenues to a high score."
20956,2020-11-09 17:45:54,jqzwe3,"Same goes for the beloved Witcher 3 then!

Truth is gameplay isn't everything. Is a lot though."
20957,2020-11-09 21:54:42,jqzwe3,Everyone's talking about Bugsnax!
20958,2020-11-10 13:11:29,jqzwe3,I haven't read the spoilers but from the initial trailer I'm almost 100% certain if you eat too many snaxs you become one yourself.
20959,2020-11-09 20:34:26,jqzwe3,I’m stupid. What do you think the twist is?
20960,2020-11-22 18:43:05,jqzwe3,"What he said is a fake spolier the game does end a little creeply but overall it's a kids game and is not like spec ops the line or whatever. Jcooklsu is also wrong, the twist is not at all what he said"
20961,2020-11-10 06:40:27,jqzwe3,"I don't really agree with the ""cheap ploy"" bit, but also I'm on mobile and cba to spoiler tag even if it's not actually related to bugsnax"
20962,2020-11-10 09:39:02,jqzwe3,Ellie did nothing wrong.
20963,2020-11-09 17:00:01,jqzwe3,Next you're going to tell me that Kemono Friends isn't about the horror of nuclear annihilation

20965,2020-11-09 18:16:26,jqzwe3,"> eldritch horror

what is eldritch horror?"
20966,2020-11-10 09:44:18,jqzwe3,That’s great
20967,2020-11-10 02:45:53,jqzwe3,[deleted]
20968,2020-11-09 16:24:49,jqzwe3,You must be unfamiliar with a game called Majora’s Mask.
20969,2020-11-09 23:32:20,jqzwe3,What’s this dark twist everyone is referring to?
20970,2020-11-09 20:45:40,jqzwe3,"Nah it's fine, I just hoped for the dark mystery hinted in the first trailer. Gonna be a while before I can play anyway."
20971,2020-11-09 22:07:22,jqzwe3,"Without spoiling practically anything, is there more depth to the world than it seems, some kind of twist etc or is it exactly what the trailers made it seem?"
20972,2020-11-09 16:29:24,jqzwe3,But what if we get a new Knack game next year? What happens then?
20973,2020-11-10 19:46:31,jqzwe3,Do You 👏 Have 👏 To 👏 Eat 👏
20974,2020-11-10 01:20:14,jqzwe3,No one beats Kero Kero Bonito.
20975,2020-11-21 21:26:57,jqzwe3,And Converge. And Tomb Mold.
20976,2020-11-09 20:07:26,jqzwe3,"By the time it comes out, Cyberpunk is going to count as retro-futurism."
20977,2020-11-10 09:47:21,jqzwe3,Rocco! Get down here this minute! You can't be late for your first day!
20978,2020-11-10 09:58:59,jqzwe3,He voiced an unnamed NPC in Shin Megami Tensei IV who only appeared once but i liked the way he said Ikebukoro.
20979,2020-11-09 17:49:15,jqzwe3,"Now that one I didn't know. Yeah, he gets around; not that I'm complaining, I think he does a good job."
20980,2020-11-10 01:28:37,jqzwe3,Robbie Draymond is fucking amazing in Persona 5. He's real close to pulling me into games just for his voice acting alone
20981,2020-11-09 22:16:53,jqzwe3,"He did such a great job as Spider-Man! The second I learned he was doing the voice, I knew he’d be fantastic"
20982,2020-11-10 10:00:58,jqzwe3,"I'm more of a Josh Keaton guy (who was Electro in S-MPS4), but Yuri is a REALLY strong second for me."
20983,2020-11-09 21:42:06,jqzwe3,"Aside from Naruto’s VA it’s not the best dub and it is not the worst.

Plus Naruto isn’t known for its script so monologues from Sasuke and Naruto in English isn’t going to sound amazing either."
20984,2020-11-09 18:49:40,jqzwe3,"Correct, it's the PS5 version. PC wouldn't be on Amazon in the first place"
20985,2020-11-09 22:30:01,jqzwe3,Can you not just get it on the PC psn store?
20986,2020-11-09 17:45:30,jqzwe3,"It's 9GB, so pretty small all things considered but hopefully that's not too large for your internet"
20987,2020-11-09 18:14:09,jqzwe3,I hope you've signed up for the Starlink beta then? If not you should do so right away.
20988,2020-11-09 18:55:13,jqzwe3,"Just for PS5 though too, just worth mentioning. It'll be up until January I believe"
20989,2020-11-09 22:33:12,jqzwe3,I've mentioned that
20990,2020-11-10 15:24:10,jqzwe3,"Crazy point, didn't consider tha- oh wait I didn't say it was free huh"
20991,2020-11-10 04:54:29,jqzwe3,Hmm probably won't get one since I work late at night on wednesday
20992,2020-11-09 17:28:26,jqzwe3,"Yep, pretty much. I always make sure to look up different reviews and gameplay footage before making any choices, scores are meaningless without understanding why people gave that score."
20993,2020-11-09 16:32:52,jqzwe3,"I get what you're saying, but it could be argued that the gameplay loop needs to be engaging in order to keep players invested in the experience, and if that doesn't happen you've failed to convey whatever it is you're trying to convey. There are also plenty of games that are still built on a backbone of ""enjoyable to play"" without trying for any other meaning or greater significance and there's a market for that. So it's a valid criticism, it may not be for everyone."
20994,2020-11-09 17:05:00,jqzwe3,"But at the same time, gameplay is the single most important part of a game, the game almost always has to be fun to play, with some exceptions for me like Telltale games or Dontnod games"
20995,2020-11-10 09:35:12,jqzwe3,"Games have been more than their *insert literally any single part of a video game like story, music, graphics, style, etc* since the SNES as well. Does that mean that criticizing any of these parts is off limits to you?"
20996,2020-11-09 21:38:57,jqzwe3,"I think it has lots of gameplay - Resource gathering, crafting, making bells, planning and executing village/home desings, etc."
20997,2020-11-09 16:54:01,jqzwe3,Animal is a simulator and not a game.
20998,2020-11-09 16:41:35,jqzwe3,"Yeah, hence why they still critique a part of that sum. And if that part drags down the entire sum for the person ""experiencing"", then it's a valid critique of the sum."
20999,2020-11-09 16:49:02,jqzwe3,"Yes and it drags it down, there's plenty of games with great gameplay /poor story and vice versa, it's important to hit on both to make a good game."
21000,2020-11-09 21:37:54,jqzwe3,Lol imo the gameplay is the best part about the game
21001,2020-11-09 20:31:20,jqzwe3,"And I'm saying it's all subjective. If someone values gameplay enough that the ""whole package"" never comes together for them without engaging gameplay, that is a valid peprspective to have."
21002,2020-11-09 18:44:25,jqzwe3,"There are many people who didn't like Witcher 3's combat.

21009,2020-11-10 04:13:50,jqzwe3,"Horror revolving around the discovery of incomprehensible beings or knowledge, which make human life insignificant by comparison and which we'll never understand. 

Ants form large 'societies' of their own and live busy lives performing tasks that are impressive and complex given their limitations, but they are so much simpler and smaller than us that they have absolutely no chance of remotely comprehending the world they're living in. We can pick up a thousand ants with no effort at all, and they probably don't even realize that the gargantuan mountain-thing moving them around is a single being with a mind a billion times as sophisticated as theirs; we think nothing of wiping out ten million of them to build things they could never begin to comprehend, like a library (???) for books (???) on law (???). Eldritch horror is about the idea that to the other inhabitants of the universe, we might be as meaningless as ants are to us. Not just ""what if aliens are aggressive"", but what if our brains just can't grasp the real nature of the universe or its other inhabitants? What if we're so pitiful and simple that we can't meaningfully engage with other beings? How would it feel to try and fail? What if those beings already exist around us and are capable of completely changing our entire existence at the drop of a hat, while not really caring if they do or don't? An ant society would conceivably worship a toddler dropping ice cream on the ground and digging in the sandbox as a powerful god, capable of bestowing unbelievable riches and horrifying destruction on them, even though it's just a baby who doesn't even realize the ants are around... what if our gods have been the equivalent?"

None of the reviews is calling the entire game bad because its gameplay isn’t the best. The vast majority of the reviews are positive there’s a good amount of average ones. The ones who found the game average probably had a bigger issue with the gameplay than those who found it great.

21062,2020-11-10 10:40:39,jqzwe3,A lot of people think eldritch horror is regular horror with tentacles. A lot of people miss the point.
21063,2020-11-10 11:12:43,jqzwe3,"Just an fyi if you do, a lot of the founding texts of eldritch horror are the works of H.P. Lovecraft. Howard was... well, there's really no way to put it kindly, the most racist person ever. Now you might be thinking surely there's now way he's the most racist person ever, that has to be an exaggeration. No, he really was. He was even a really esoteric racist like some of the high ranking Nazis worshipping Odin, just with weird British racism (and he wasn't even British...) Look up his cat if you don't believe me.

Now that can't stop you from enjoying his works. Well, not all of them at least. But its good to keep in mind if you ever delve into it. There are many other authors to check out, but if you read the ones that started it all its kind of disgusting because that whole most racist person ever thing SHOWS. Holy hell is it bad. 

Some of the more famous works still are enjoyable, Shadow Over Innsmouth is a very famous Lovecraft story that I think holds up really well despite the obvious racism.  At the Mountains of Madness is fairly tame, Color out of Space is pretty good even if it relies on very outdated science, and I can't seemingly remember any big racism moments in the Dunwich Horror.

That said stuff like the Call of Cthulu, The Case of Charles Dexter Ward, The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath, they're all good but the racism makes you constantly have to cringe while reading it. Other stories like Medusa's Coil and the Horror at Red Hook are just horrible, with the spooky twist just being ""~Minorities~ Ooooooooh""

If you get the chance pick up a collection of his stories but honestly if you want to get into the genre without it then that's fine. They're not essential. Just some stuff you should know about the dude who basically invented the genre. I assume you're into video games because of the subreddit, Bloodborne is hard to get into but its basically the best eldritch horror story there is, so that also works."

I like my ""for the gameplay"" games and my ""for the story"" games, but it always sucks if a lot of your time is spent with something poor.  Fortunately a bad story is usually skippable (and also usually minimal), unfortunately bad gameplay is usually not, so titles with bad gameplay are far more egregious to me.

Since a lot of them benefit from being interactive, just give me less gameplay/combat please.  Looking at you Witcher 3."
21077,2020-11-09 18:52:08,jqzwe3,"I think that's a fair point but I personally have never played anything that made me say ""This would have been better for a movie."" The interaction, even if not good, adds the extra layer of storytelling and immersion that I can't get with films.

21078,2020-11-09 22:22:14,jqzwe3,"Actually, what you're describing used to be the expectation of a review. I'm talking pre-games here, but the goal was to convey what a thing was, not how much or how little the writer valued it personally. 

The value judgment was on whether or not a thing was ""successful"" in the abstract, and that required removing oneself from personal taste and placing the weight on what that piece communicated, or failed to communicate, on its own terms.

Criticism has evolved, but not so dramatically that Jim Sterling's parody of ""the objective review"" is insightful. With the frequency of hot takes claiming objectivity is a fairy tale, I worry the sentiment has done more harm than good. A critic fundamentally strives for objectivity. It's ok to acknowledge the impossibility of that goal, but if you aren't striving for it, you're not a journalist. You're a blogger.

It is absolutely correct that it doesn't matter what a game was trying to do, and I would argue that's true even when the developer explicitly states it, but if a writer projecting authority decides to measure a thing based on limited criteria, they also have a responsibility to argue why that criteria is the primary window through which to understand the piece.

Full disclosure, I have almost no understanding of Bugsnax."
21079,2020-11-09 21:07:11,jqzwe3,"Fair enough, you did say that.  I wouldn't touch a game that played like Witcher 3 if it didn't also have an exceptional story to go with it, so I would never call the gameplay good.  But I also avoid stuff like your standard AssCreed titles as I already know, that shit ain't for me.  I'm sure that means there is probably worse out there in popular gaming than TW3's combat.

I'm sure rference points here matter.  For me Witcher 3 is one of the worst playing games I've played in the last 5 or so years but as I said, there's titles with bad gameplay that I already know to avoid.  I'm sure for some, those titles are the 'neutral' reference and Witcher 3 is a step above that.  For me, any worse than TW3 and I'd drop the game, it wouldn't matter how good the story is at that point."
21080,2020-11-09 21:11:41,jqzwe3,"Look at it like this. The gameplay is your toolbox. It has a hammer, a screwdriver and some nails and screws. A quest is a notice saying «I need you to hammer in some nails,» except it contextualizes it, like «I need you to build a table.» a system would be putting a saw in your toolbox.

Clearly quests are part of the gameplay *loop*, but the loop is just context too."

It is an exaggeration. He was racist, even for his time. He was not ""the most racist person ever""."
21083,2020-11-10 16:10:33,jqzwe3,"Death of the author and all that, H. P. Lovecraft came from a time that where racist views were both normal AND were amplified by his absolute hysterical fear of, well, everything.  It is that abnormal perpetual fear that forms the basis of those works, and it provides an interesting template for a metafiction.

One can appreciate that perspective and the narrative it creates without somehow being corrupted by the work into adopting racist views oneself.  It is a good work of fiction that creates a compelling narrative even if one doesn't agree with the underlying themes, because the themes are ultimately decided by the reader, not the author, and through our reinterpretation of the genre we can find new horrors salient to the modern age that don't delve in fears we now consider archaic and bigoted."

21095,2020-11-10 09:42:50,jqzwe3,"Your line of thinking leads to a bunch of issues. 

The biggest one is something I heard/read Jeff from GiantBomb discuss. I can’t be fucked to try and find the source, but anyway he explained (possibly from his GameSpot days) where in an attempt to completely ”objectify” reviews they ran into a situation where they gave a game (might’ve been about Skyward Sword?) 10/10 while never actually really enjoying it. On objective terms they couldn’t really find issues with the game, they just didn’t enjoy playing it.

”10/10, checks all the boxes, didn’t enjoy playing it at all” isn’t a review format that I find meaningful.

Not to mention that pretending like you can look at practically anything in a 100% objective manner is incredibly naive."
21096,2020-11-10 16:24:24,jqzwe3,"I don't think Death of the Author is really applicable to be honest. The themes of existential dread and nihilism that are the cause for horror in Lovecraft's books are ones that you can experience without being basically a Nazi, which he was in all but name. The problem is that while its compelling its also horrendously dated language. Reading old books can be tiresome because of flowery vocabulary but Lovecraft just lived to use slurs and stereotypes ever step of the way, sometimes dedicating paragraphs to describing how non-white characters are.

Even for the time he was horrendously racist. And its not just that he's horrifically racist, its infused in his work. Whether that be themes of being anti-race mixing in Shadow Over Innsmouth or using the fact that a character is nonwhite to tip off the reader that they're suspicious, its impossible to separate Lovecraft's racism from his work. In Medusa's Coil the big twist is... Dun Dun! She's black!

I think that someone really should edit his stories and try to make them less obscenely racist. I think especially in today's day his stories are relevant. We seem to have a bit of a cultural obsession with despair and feeling alone, and Lovecraft was masterful at turning that into very good horror. The problem is the man himself was in despair because he was highly paranoid and xenophobic, and its so obvious."
21097,2020-11-10 11:49:47,jqzwe3,"From's methods of 'indirect storytelling' aka story through item description can be annoying, I can totally understand skipping over it. Helps when the world and gameplay are so good lol.

If you're into audiobooks the Complete Works of H.P. Lovecraft is on audible, and I know its kind of a meme company now but audible really is great, I recommend it and the two guys who voice the book are amateurs who do a great job imo."
21098,2020-11-09 23:31:04,jqzwe3,"Yeah you and I have a very different understanding of “dark” Doki Doki is dark. MM, the train in FF6 or Don are the equivalent of underlying things in Nickelodeon shows."
21099,2020-11-09 20:57:03,jqzwe3,I'm saying that Majora's Mask isn't inherently that much darker than your average Final Fantasy game. It's weirder but the stuff it deals with is common in things kids watch and play.
21100,2020-11-13 10:39:53,jqzwe3,"Included services are not referred to as free. It's like saying ""I got a free burger when I purchased a burger from McDonalds!""

No, you literally purchased a burger and got a burger for it. The game is what you get for purchasing PS+."
21101,2020-11-09 22:50:48,jqzwe3,There are fundamentals and foundations recognized by criticism that are more objective than subjective. Does that make criticism objective rather than subjective? No.
21102,2020-11-10 10:02:25,jqzwe3,"I thought I conveyed this well enough, but I don't think any critic believes it's possible to be 100% objective. I was referring to those who strive to be as objective as possible."
21103,2020-11-10 16:35:10,jqzwe3,"Death of the author is applicable to everyone.  Once a work of art has been created, it is immediately out of the author's hands and in that of the reader's.  In this case even the reader's interpretation trumps the author's intention.  Works that might have been made with bigoted intent can be transformed to new purpose though reinterpretation in modern perspectives.  That is the fluidity of art."
21104,2020-11-10 10:10:03,jqzwe3,">	I was referring to those who strive to be as objective as possible.

And literally everything but the last sentence in my comment is addressing that."
21105,2020-11-10 10:20:10,jqzwe3,"I've heard that Gerstmann story, but it doesn't sound like people observing critical theory or journalistic integrity. It sounds like people making a silly checklist."
21106,2020-11-10 10:35:54,jqzwe3,How often do you find movie/music reviews that observe ”journalistic integrity”? IMO reviews are the best as opinion pieces and I think trying to turn them into a science is a wasted effort fueled by naivety.
21107,2020-11-10 20:10:20,jqzwe3,"I don't read music reviews, but for movie reviews that cling to journalistic integrity, I point to David Edelstein of NYMag, Christy Lemire of RogerEbert.com, Todd McCarthy of Hollywood Reporter (but he just quit because the new owner are destroying that publication), and A.O. Scott of the NYTimes.

But it's rare. Each time an actual journalist steps down, or gets fired for a politically incorrect observation, they are written about as ""The last real film critic"". It's an exaggeration, but a popular one because their replacement is usually someone with little to no journalistic background."
21108,2020-11-10 23:31:19,jqzwe3,"I read David Edelstein’s Spider-Man: Far from Home review and I don’t really get what you mean. It’s a well-written review, but I don’t really understand how it’s supposedly ”more objective/scientific” than well-written game reviews."
21109,2020-11-11 02:03:22,jqzwe3,"You were asking about integrity, and I feel Edelstein is someone who serves as an excellent example of that. 

But generally, I think he does strive to remain objective. That's not the same thing as treating criticism as a hard science though, so your having used ""objective/scientific"" makes me think that could be part of the backlash.

What I'm referring to is more like... Mandalorian creed, I guess, as a poor comparison my brain is only entertaining right now because I started watching television since the last reply. 

Game journalists don't usually have much connection to journalism school, and aren't old enough to revere the foundations of hard boiled Nixon-era newspapermen or even older theater and art critique, so what they're doing shares more in common with an op-ed opinion column or letters to the editor, throwing up a blanket of ""all things subjective"" whenever someone points out their lack of professionalism.

P.S. Bugsnax!"
21110,2020-11-09 16:01:52,jqzur6,I remember being so high on Anthony Randolph. He was suppose to be the next KG.
21111,2020-11-09 16:37:05,jqzur6,"All of this because Melo wanted to get the most money possible.

Look I get it and I respect it but a part of the narrative that Carmelo never had a good team around him can be blamed on him in my opinion."

21121,2020-11-09 22:31:33,jqzur6,08-09 nuggets were really good though
21122,2020-11-09 18:47:43,jqzur6,I just don't get why people put the trade blame on him. I understand he didn't help lol. But its his agents job to get him the most money. Neither Melo nor his agent had the authority to sign off on such a trade.
21123,2020-11-09 17:40:33,jqzur6,"Had he signed into cap space to New York, they could have traded those pieces for another star. Worse case scenario Gallo is a great piece to have in an offensive system with D'Anthony and Chandler could work as a pretty good 6th man. In hindsight we know that Dwight became available 2 years later."

21132,2020-11-10 08:17:05,jqzur6,Man you never watched that guy play he looks crippled when he moves his legs
21133,2020-11-09 20:01:13,jqzur6,"Which is fine as I admitted in my previous comment, I'm just saying that he has made a lot of bad decisions that took him out of championship contention to have the narrative that his teams were never good enough. Maybe if he allowed the core to stay there and didn't require picks to get involved he would have a better squad around him in NY that he loved so much."
21134,2020-11-10 05:39:30,jqzur6,You’re right in the sense that the Knicks ended up bidding against themselves because Dolan was impatient and paranoid the Nets would swoop in.
21135,2020-11-09 20:16:19,jqzur6,Partial blame on the uncertainty surrounding that off seasons lockout
21136,2020-11-22 08:09:17,jqzur6,Kinda like Kenny George 😕
21137,2020-11-10 12:01:24,jqzur6,You can't teach 7 ft 5 🤷🏾‍♂️
21138,2020-11-09 20:09:04,jqzur6,"No I hear you I just don't see why its Melo not allowing the core to stay there as opposed to James Dolan. Like no one ever says, ""Wow Paul George negotiated all these draft picks for the Thunder."" So why do a lot of people say, ""Melo should not have gotten core players or picks involved"" you know what I mean? I get that he could have just signaled to the Knicks that he would sign in free agency. Boom problem solved. But if I'm Melo then I'm thinking ""the knicks have all the leverage in the world since I'm a UFA in a couple months, they will probably trade 1 asset for me"", I still don't get why they traded the whole damn house for a guy they had a 75% (if not higher) chance of signing for free. 

&#x200B;

It was a stupid trade no doubt but it was the GMs decision to make"
21139,2020-11-09 22:34:46,jqzur6,I think it's mainly due to PG going to teams to be the 2nd banana and Melo was going to NY to be the man. The Melo case is why I am always going to think players need to never seek a trade before they leave as a superstar status player.
21140,2020-11-10 08:19:25,jqzur6,"I mean, it worked out pretty well for Anthony Davis; and Kawhi Leonard, and Kevin Love, and Shaq, and Kevin Garnett. 

But sure, we should listen to your advice on the subject"
21141,2020-11-10 14:41:27,jqzur6,"They all went to teams with elite supporting players
AD- Bron

Kawhi - They were 1st in the east and DeRozan wasn't that good

Kevin Love - Bron

Shaq - Wade

Are you super high or Advija or just think GSW needs the wing depth? I would also rather POR go for Achiuwa if he’s up and if they’re going guard idk if they want a project like Hampton; Maxey or Maledon would be much better picks I think. Nice mock tho! I think Stanley, Winston, and Azubuike have tremendous sleeper potential in the second round."

21209,2020-11-04 20:59:49,jnzema,Suns pick will come down to who the get in FA but I think they definitely get a PG in this draft at 10. Kira Lewis or Tyrell Terry
21210,2020-11-04 22:55:55,jnzema,Tf is a Patrick Williams
21211,2020-11-04 23:32:06,jnzema,Haliburton to New York makes me want to puke
21212,2020-11-04 23:59:11,jnzema,If Portland drafts another fucking guard in the 1st I'm going to scream
21213,2020-11-28 23:54:17,jnzema,3/30 not bad my friend
21214,2020-11-04 20:43:00,jnzema,Cavs need a wing that can defend. They have serviceable bigs. Obi Toppin is bad on defense because he has no neck.
21215,2020-11-05 01:50:22,jnzema,i dont think azubuike falls to us but its nice to dream lol
21216,2020-11-04 16:17:21,jnzema,"I follow the draft year around, this year has been weird though with Covid and less leaks.  I like the NBA offseason just as much as the season."
21217,2020-11-04 16:30:12,jnzema,His range looks to be 4-10 likely more towards 10.  I put him in at 11 as a BPA pick because he was falling in my draft and I didn't see him slipping anymore.
21218,2020-11-04 16:27:42,jnzema,I 100% agree.  Could be a lot of trading since the draft is so wide open because people will want to grab the guy they like.
21219,2020-11-04 16:22:12,jnzema,"He likely goes late 1st may even go as high as late lottery. The thing with Poku is his buy out varies depending on where he is picked if he goes in the teens or higher it is 1.5mil, 20s it is 1mil, and 2nd round it is only 500,000 so he may drop because of his buyouts sliding scale."
21220,2020-11-04 18:27:01,jnzema,He probably goes to OKC at pick 25
21221,2020-11-04 17:15:10,jnzema,Could be someone trades up to take Ball there more of a BPA pick.  Bulls could use an upgrade at PG and Ball is the best PG in the draft.
21222,2020-11-04 17:53:21,jnzema,yeah I was going to say it’s highly unlikely we take a pg when we have Coby Kris and sato already... I see us taking Deni if he’s still there Okoro would be a stretch with that pick but I’d also be happy with a 3&D guy cuz we need perimeter defenders desperately.
21223,2020-11-04 18:29:46,jnzema,"
>not bad for the Knicks either

It's pretty bad for us. Haliburton at 8 isn't that bad but Nico and Paul Reed aren't it for us.

At pick 27, Tyler Bey or Jah'mius Ramsey are much better players and fits.

At pick 38 Isaiah Joe or Jordan Nwora fit much better"
21224,2020-11-04 18:08:37,jnzema,"Avidija seems to be moving to the top of the draft and legit could go #1.  I think C is biggest need for Warriors so Wiseman makes sense there, but have read they like Deni more, which also makes sense he could plug in at the 4 and Draymond moves to the 5 to give Warriors their new Death Lineup."
21225,2020-11-04 19:37:21,jnzema,Stanley is a mid 2nd rounder that would be a reach to take him in the 1st.  If Lakers like him they have been known to buy into the 2nd round to grab guys.
21226,2020-11-04 20:27:36,jnzema,"20 is too high to take Flynn and Quickley.  

I haven't seen Anthony linked to Miami, but I have seen Smith linked to them.  Miami could use some depth down low and Smith fits the mold as a guy that can stretch the floor and defend.  I think Smith goes late lottery to early 20s so he is also a BPA  pick since he is towards the end of his draft range.  I think Anthony has a range in the early to mid 20s."
21227,2020-11-04 23:12:03,jnzema,He will go in the 5-10 range would give the Suns a stretch 4 which they wanted with Saric who underperformed.  Williams best comparison is Danilo Gallinari offensively but he is a much better defender and a crazy athlete.
21228,2020-11-29 01:22:25,jnzema,"My Final Mock Was  Little Better Had 8 correct picks, 50/60 drafted correct, 26/30 1st rounders correct."
21229,2020-11-04 22:36:03,jnzema,Cavs haven't drafted for need the past few years and Toppin is clearly the BPA at their pick plus their frontcourt is the oldest part of their roster.
21230,2020-11-04 18:26:36,jnzema,"I was going to post mine yesterday than my computer restarted and I lost everything. 

But just to comment on the Knicks stuff.

Knicks want a shot creator at 8 if they go PG, and they really like Okoro. They've taken a huge liking to Kira as well. So Kira and Okoro would probably be over Haliburton since the fit is worse and there's less interest.

As for pick 27, Nico Mannion is not it. He's not it. I gotta stress that he's not it. He's projected 2nd round to undrafted, he's not going to 27 to the Knicks. The Knicks can't play 4 point guards (DSJ, Frank, Nico, Haliburton).

Tyler Bey, Ramsey, Joe, and Nwora would all be much much better fits, players, and fill a need for the Knicks."
21231,2020-11-04 19:43:40,jnzema,"It sounds like the Cavs FO is very high on him. If Deni is off the table, I'd be surprised if we don't take Okoro."
21232,2020-11-04 16:36:15,jnzema,"I see someone like Devin Vassell and think they could be the next elite 3&D guy (which is extremely valuable) but I don’t think they could become a superstar.

I actually think Toppin can be an all-star if he hasn’t peaked already"
21233,2020-11-04 19:35:35,jnzema,I have seen him linked there as well.
21234,2020-11-04 18:16:42,jnzema,"None of those is good enough to build around.

LaMelo may be.

This high you always take BPA, unless you're absolutely set for years to come imo."
21235,2020-11-04 18:39:26,jnzema,"Yeah I just saw Haliburton and didn’t think too much lol I love what that guy can bring to the table for them

I’m a UA fan and I don’t even like Mannion that much he’s not very good shooting off the dribble or finishing around the rim I see him right now as playmaking as his only plus skill with it mainly being relegated to playmaking in the open court which I don’t see Thibodeau embracing 

Ramsey would be best at that pick for them bc they need shooting and a guy that can hound on defense 

I do like Paul Reed (even though we only saw him playing at DePaul) he kinda reminds me of a guy in the mold of a young Javale however I just wasn’t really thinking about their situation I need to do my homework on Joe and Nwora but Perry is a guy I really like

I think the main thing for them is getting playmakers and shooting around RJ so he can do what he does best which is get to the rim 

I think Bolmaro could be a nice sleeper pick in the second round for them too"
21236,2020-11-04 18:42:44,jnzema,I think what we’re hearing from GSW is a lot of smoke and mirrors they can really do whatever they want with that pick bc if they’re back healthy next season they’re a contender in the playoffs so I think the guy they go for is high upside and I just see Wiseman as being that guy
21237,2020-11-04 23:50:04,jnzema,klutch guy
21238,2020-11-04 23:13:12,jnzema,"No shit? 

Drop knowledge then, I’ll check him out. 

I don’t remember seeing a his name until now."
21239,2020-11-29 01:38:13,jnzema,lol i was only counting the first 30 lol
21240,2020-11-04 22:46:40,jnzema,"Yeah. But they've got Drummond, Thompson, Nance, and Love. And they've shown a willingness to pay vets to keep the locker room from going to trash."
21241,2020-11-04 19:34:04,jnzema,Mannion is projected to go last 1st to late 2nd so I don't know where you have seen him as a 2nd round to undrafted guy.  I agree not a great fit for the Knicks put him there more as I see that pick getting traded by the Knicks.
21242,2020-11-04 16:38:32,jnzema,Vassell I think will be similar to Matisse Thybulle so like an Andre Roberson type player.  Toppin reminds me of Amare Stoudemire.
21243,2020-11-04 18:18:49,jnzema,Well I’m not guaranteed that LaMelo is a sure fire thing... Yeah the playmaking is nice but he is allergic to defense and we don’t have many defenders on the roster outside of Dunn and Carter... I believe LaMelo will be a solid player just not in Chicago.
21244,2020-11-04 19:42:00,jnzema,I see Paul Reed as a Darrell Arthur type player.
21245,2020-11-04 19:40:07,jnzema,Wiseman doesn't really have great upside to me I see him as a Hassan Whiteside type player.   Onyeka Okongwu I believe has the higher upside of the Centers who are supposed to go high in the draft.  Okongwu I see as a Bam Adebayo type player.
21246,2020-11-05 00:44:16,jnzema,"[https://nbadraft.theringer.com/](https://nbadraft.theringer.com/) \#16 on their big board.

21247,2020-11-04 23:08:39,jnzema,"Thompson is a free agent he could stay but just as likely to go chase a ring.

Drummond could opt out probably doesn't would be stupid to because he won't get that money on market so he stays.

Love is always being shopped."
21248,2020-11-04 19:52:29,jnzema,Mannion was projected late 1st early 2nd like 4 months ago. His stock continued to fall since then. I havent seen any mocks in the past 2 months that had him in the 1st round
21249,2020-11-04 17:22:37,jnzema,"Vassell can actually shoot and dribble, though."
21250,2020-11-04 18:28:03,jnzema,LaMelo's on ball defense is poor but his help defense improved a lot over seas. He'll be fine. His size at 6'7 with a 6'10 wingspan help that
21251,2020-11-04 19:55:32,jnzema,"I see more athleticism out of him than Darrell Arthur, but less of Arthur's faceup game, making me think he's gonna be used more in the nba for his ability in the open court as a rim runner. I think Reed is in that same vein of role player as Arthur which is still great value that late in the draft."
21252,2020-11-04 20:08:23,jnzema,Okongwu reminds me of Clint Capela with some offensive versatility on the low block. I think Wiseman's floor is Whiteside. His offensive game is more versatile than Okongwu. I think his first year he'll pretty much be a rim runner but he has good form and some range so a nice base to work from. And you can't teach 7'1 and that kind of athleticism.
21253,2020-11-05 01:25:52,jnzema,"Thompson will re-sign at a favorable rate. And if Lil Kev wants to play for a contender, he’s going to need to restructure his deal. Drummond is taking the option."
21254,2020-11-04 20:05:52,jnzema,"He was lottery months ago and yes he has fallen, but here is [NBAdraft.net](https://NBAdraft.net) mock from yesterday and they have one of the most accurate mocks along with the DraftExpress/ESPN guys every year.  He is #23.

21255,2020-11-04 17:37:37,jnzema,"He can shoot, but he needs to improve his ballhandling to be able to create his shot at the NBA level."
21256,2020-11-04 20:23:30,jnzema,Nbadraft.net is notorious for having some of the most inaccurate mocks ever
21257,2020-11-04 20:29:49,jnzema,"Throughout the year it may not be accurate, but they get it dialed in the week or two leading up to the draft and their final mock is always pretty close.  This years draft is one of the biggest crap shoots in awhile so it will be interesting.  I am not saying I am a huge Mannion fan I think he is a lot like Landry Shamet."

21259,2020-11-04 17:18:14,jnz7qn,I'm okay with okoro :)
21260,2020-11-05 02:35:53,jnz7qn,As a Celtics fan I’m cool with this
21261,2020-11-04 20:38:12,jnz7qn,Don't think NY takes Mannion at 27 when there's a shit ton of proven point guards with much better measurables. You take Mannion if you're hoping he can eventually lead the second unit.
21262,2020-11-05 04:03:29,jnz7qn,"I like this draft for Philly. Getting Cole Anthony would be ideal at the OKC pick, as he gives us a young PG who excel's at OTD shooting. Zeke Nnaji would be a good pick aswell if Malachi Flynn dosen't fall. The things I'd change would be picking Isaiah Joe at 36, Mason Jones at 49, and Nate Hinton at 58."
21263,2020-11-05 17:57:01,jnz7qn,I know it's fashionable to mock Toppin to the Cavs.  I think they do like Obi but can't take him with Love on the roster for at least 2 more years.  No I don't think they deal Love (might not be able to either without giving up assets which they won't do).  There are just not enough minutes available for Toppin who probably needs to play now at age 22.
21264,2020-11-04 16:25:45,jnz7qn,I could def see them take Wiseman I just have seen recently they are higher on Deni.  Should be a lot of trading this draft since it is so wide open.

21266,2020-11-04 16:32:07,jnz7qn,I mean reports are Deni could realistically go #1 to Minnesota so trading down to get him may not workout for them if that is who they really want.

Last week was the start. This recent week was a full-on takeover after that fumble. Tom and BA looked pleased. Fournette is more of a total package; run, catch, block and with strength to handle goal line/RZ carries. 

There was one play on a crucial 3rd down. Fournette lined up in the slot. Brady targeted him. The timing was so spot on. The defense made a great play though but it shows Brady trusts Fournette much more and they have nice chemistry. Fournette when he was in the passing play he looked much more prepared because he expected the ball. He knows how Tommy plays.

PS. I dont know in your league but in mine it is reflected even in the projection. Fournette now has mid RB2 type of projection already."

21319,2020-11-04 19:24:18,jnxz17,"Move RoJo, if you can. If it's a keeper league, go after a diamond in the rough for next year. B.A. really like Fournette. B.A. actually gives a shit about his players. Fournette told B.A. that he was about 80%, but he was ready to play. Bruce sat him one more week to make sure he was 100% for the end of season push. 

Look at T. Pope in place of Ekler, he is still available in a lot of leagues."

21321,2020-11-04 20:00:03,jnxz17,why are you rostering so many?? brieda murray and hasty shouldnt be on a team with this many rb’s
21322,2020-11-04 17:40:08,jnxz17,"You can maybe drop Bernard or trade him, mixon should be coming back in after his bye week"
21323,2020-11-04 19:30:22,jnxz17,"If you need WRs, try and move Gio before Mixon comes back. You could even try to trade Murray to a A.K. owner as a handcuff. If you need a QB, try and move both Gio and Murray together. 

You could get crazy and sell Derrick Henry, he should be worth a great QB and an ok WR. Maybe even a decent WR/RB combo too.

Is this a keeper league or a 1 and done league ?"
21324,2020-11-08 01:13:40,jnxz17,Moss and Dobbins owner here
21325,2020-11-04 16:40:08,jnxz17,What was your return?
21326,2020-11-04 17:00:15,jnxz17,Lucky. Wasn’t able to get him off my hands and it’s probably too late for me now. Thankfully I have other options like JRob and Gibson
21327,2020-11-04 16:40:11,jnxz17,"Didn't watch but he had 4 - two 12 yard receptions, a 14 yard reception, and a failed 2pt conversion that he caught.

According to [PFR's play-by-play](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/202011010sea.htm#pbp::none)"
21328,2020-11-04 19:24:28,jnxz17,Laviska I’d say
21329,2020-11-04 17:29:11,jnxz17,dude i did this exact same trade but instead of johnson i got chark
21330,2020-11-04 20:37:38,jnxz17,I'm about to trade CEH for David Montgomery.....
21331,2020-11-04 19:24:55,jnxz17,I’d say so
21332,2020-11-04 23:13:16,jnxz17,"I have Jones, Carson, J Williams and Brieda. Moss is my RB1 by default lol"
21333,2020-11-04 15:04:23,jnxz17,Well he averaged 4.2 against the saints last week so....
21334,2020-11-04 15:02:43,jnxz17,"don't read the post then? or make your own with whatever title you want

imagine being this pedantic about stupid shit"
21335,2020-11-04 15:04:12,jnxz17,"I traded Gibson because I was stacked at rb lmao. Had Zeke, Gaskin, Carson, Pollard (when he was wroth a hold), Mostert and Gibson."
21336,2020-11-04 15:13:04,jnxz17,Pope (26) is not younger than Jackson (25)
21337,2020-11-04 17:16:03,jnxz17,"Took a gamble and traded Aiyuk for Fournette last week. Extremely pleased with what I saw Monday night. They didn’t give ROJO a chance after his fumble and I didn’t see Brady show any frustration, even after mediocre plays.

If I learned anything from that game is that if he (or anyone else on the offense) keeps Brady happy, they will keep getting the ball."
21338,2020-11-06 20:29:31,jnxz17,Lol sorry you got downvoted for this
21339,2020-11-04 18:15:33,jnxz17,I didn’t get to see any of the game but I did notice he only averaged around 2.5 ypc. Not ideal.
21340,2020-11-04 16:06:32,jnxz17,I see. I've always associated red with bad/stop & green with good/go
21341,2020-11-09 15:55:08,jnxz17,"Montgomery, but man, what a disappointing week. Essentially drops me out of the playoffs. Imagine having Josh Allen and Tyreek Hill and losing"
21342,2020-11-04 19:28:12,jnxz17,"Unfortunately it is not keeper. I couldn't resist grabbing Lenny in round 10 as my Rb 4 on the roster. I'm hoping he can blow up in value THIS season, but with Rojo healthy he's nothing but a flex play IMO."
21343,2020-11-04 20:10:12,jnxz17,"I dropped Wilkins. 

Sanders is on bye. 

Keeping Gio in case mixon isn’t good to go next week. 

Latavius is handcuff and stand alone flex value (if desperate) due to 10 touches a game. 

Hasty *and* Henry start this week. 

And Breida might be starter in MIA for next 3 weeks, so want to see how that plays out."
21344,2020-11-04 16:43:23,jnxz17,"* CEH, JRob (before last blowup game) and Devante Parker for Cmc and Mike Davis

* CEH and Boyd for Julio

* CEH for Fuller"
21345,2020-11-04 17:28:34,jnxz17,i also drafted CEH and traded. traded him and DJ moore for mixon and chark
21346,2020-11-04 17:00:23,jnxz17,Nice thanks man
21347,2020-11-04 17:39:24,jnxz17,Is mckinnon a start? I’m worried he’s gonna do the same thing he did two weeks ago
21348,2020-11-04 17:32:04,jnxz17,Yea diontae was pretty much just a throw in he’ll probably never crack my lineup. I have Adams DK arob and Godwin. I’m hoping mixon is the engine that takes me to the chip I have jrob as my other rb starting my WRs in the flex spot
21349,2020-11-04 21:28:15,jnxz17,And holding Bell?
21350,2020-11-04 16:16:56,jnxz17,"Don't listen to this guy. Your effort, post, and title are much appreciated."
21351,2020-11-04 15:03:37,jnxz17,or just be consistent and not lazy
21352,2020-11-04 15:23:37,jnxz17,"RIP... my first 3 draft picks were saquon,drake,mixon so I feel your pain. I thought I was good too man"
21353,2020-11-04 15:23:44,jnxz17,"Not OP, but you and I have two very different interpretations of what “stacked” at RB means"
21354,2020-11-04 16:05:15,jnxz17,"Oh ok.   Figured he was, still worth seeing how it goes"
21355,2020-11-04 22:39:40,jnxz17,You fleeced that man.
21356,2020-11-06 21:04:20,jnxz17,"Didn’t even notice till now lol. Like I said the guy is trash, ain’t no way I was gonna drop Jet for him"
21357,2020-11-04 19:16:06,jnxz17,"Hasty had 1 bad game. He is an angry UDFA, he runs hard and has a great burst of speed in his back pocket when he needs it. I am a die hard Cowboys fan (born in TX), but I really like Hasty. I give him the rest of this year and maybe preseason next year and he will be there starter for the 49ers."
21358,2020-11-04 19:17:44,jnxz17,"It's 2020. Red means Green and No means ""Sure I will marry you !""."
21359,2020-11-04 17:02:18,jnxz17,"You're welcome, good luck."
21360,2020-11-04 17:44:55,jnxz17,"Personally, I think Shanahan is going to use the Vikings and TB blueprint to steamroll the Packers with runs and screens, so I'd trust McKinnon here even in a RBBC. Totally understand the fear though, he's put up some lousy games, but I'd still start him unless I had some favourable matchups to turn to."
21361,2020-11-04 15:06:37,jnxz17,"good call, i'll make sure to mix it up way more next week"
21362,2020-11-04 15:36:30,jnxz17,"I’m in two leagues and happened to get pick #2 in both.

League 1: Saquon, Carson, Golladay

League 2: Saquon, Carson, Godwin

Good stuff"
21363,2020-11-04 15:26:56,jnxz17,"? Before injuries, Zeke was great Carson was great, Gaskin was trending and ended up being a volume rb2, Pollard was great Zeke insurance, Mostert was fantastic when healthy he was my only injured guy, Gibson has been great but his snap % and bad offense weren’t reliable. 

How much better besides having the stars align and end up with 3 rb1’s could you really have been."
21364,2020-11-05 00:16:41,jnxz17,"I’d never get a trade like that if I offered it, just got lucky."
21365,2020-11-04 19:29:51,jnxz17,Yeah I had looked back at his game log after my comment and he looked a lot better against NE and LAR. Wish he was more involved in the pass game though.
21366,2020-11-04 17:48:05,jnxz17,"Would you start him or deejay? Dj had a great game last week. Or both, but that means taking Marvin Jones out of flex and into the bench"
21367,2020-11-04 21:13:22,jnxz17,"As someone with both hasty and McKinnon, which is the better play? 

Debating even on playing both instead of Beasley in my flex.."
21368,2020-11-04 15:07:24,jnxz17,please mix it up more next week!
21369,2020-11-04 16:09:28,jnxz17,"Zeek isn’t injured he’s a victim of a broken team, so unless Dallas gets better as a whole his value won’t return to that first two weeks of the season.

 Carson is great but currently has a nagging injury 

Pollard is the backup RB to Zeke and Zekes terrible situation 

Mostert is in the IR

Gibson is a solid RB2 with RB1 upside



I’m not knocking your team, I don’t consider you stacked at RB. You have depth but your not stacked."
21370,2020-11-04 20:14:35,jnxz17,"I just watched SF game highlights and Hasty highlights from last week. It really did look like a bad game overall for everyone on SF not named Aiyuk. When the QB plays that bad and gets the team into that big a hole, usually only the top tier guys can make a salvageable day out of that. Saw multiple times Hasty being met in the backfield or stacked boxes so the HOPE is with Mullens starting from the bat, the offense runs smoother. However.....they just lost Bourne to COVID and now we gotta see the covid fallout from that."
21371,2020-11-04 18:01:03,jnxz17,"Oof. Tough for me to say. As a Viking fan it always feels like Marvin Jones crucifies us, and should do well against a weak secondary, but he usually has Golladay to draw coverage.

Really at a loss tbh. If you felt confident in choosing the safer side, I'd go 2xRB. If not and you felt like you needed a gamble, I'd maybe go McKinnon and Jones =/ really unsure though, and some of that is expecting a Deejay second game drop-off or potential split carries if Hyde returns."
21372,2020-11-04 19:37:29,jnxz17,DJ and MJ. Golliday is out MJ will be #1 and Hasty will be fighting for reps in the 49ers backfield.
21373,2020-11-05 18:12:16,jnxz17,"Probably Hasty but only because of volume, it will probably come down to who breaks off the big run (or catch and run) for a TD. Honestly, I'd probably play Beasley and Hasty here, another tough call though, especially since Seahawks should be bolstering their defence this week.

EDIT - I was wrong..."
21374,2020-11-04 22:32:58,jnxz17,make sure to cry more next week too!
21375,2020-11-04 16:22:06,jnxz17,"My whole point going back to the original post was before injuries (dak, Carson etc that impact my team) I was strong at rb and that’s why I traded Gibson tho"
21376,2020-11-04 18:06:29,jnxz17,"I’m really not arguing with u/Jwr32 but he did have stacked RBs: Zeke was his RB1, Carson was his RB2, Mostert and Gibson were his two flex RB options, and Pollard for his insurance. I probably would have done the same at that point if I had just picked up Gaskin and did not intend to start Gibson ever. Maybe someone else would start him as their flex but I wouldn’t have relied on a rookie like that"
21377,2020-11-04 18:03:05,jnxz17,"Just saw that the Green Bay game was postponed, here’s to hoping that jones is still out, and Williams is off the Covid list so I just play him instead :)"
21378,2020-11-04 19:38:26,jnxz17,Is dj going to be the only back for Seattle this week?
21379,2020-11-04 18:06:45,jnxz17,"Confirmed postponed? Saw the 49-ers COVID news but hadn't heard about a rescheduling yet.

Definitely does sound like a Sunday game now though. Speculation is both Jones and Williams will be back, but with Jones taking a limited role to spell him back to full fitness, so think you're approach is probably wise."
21380,2020-11-04 20:55:43,jnxz17,"Yes, that is what it is looking like this week. Carson, Hyde, and Homer are going to miss this week. Homer is closer to 70%, he might suit up, but that would be a worse case scenario. DJ, also has some pass catching ability as well. Trade him or play him this week. If you have the Xtra roster spot, maybe even stash him. Healthy RBs are becoming harder and harder to find this year."
21381,2020-11-04 18:08:03,jnxz17,"Nah not confirmed, but with all the players in Covid and now this morning the SF facilities being closed due to Covid I would bet money on it being postponed"
21382,2020-11-04 18:13:08,jnxz17,"Fair, shouldn't affect my choices too much so wasn't really scouting it out. Thanks for the heads up."

While Wiseman is athletic, his skillset can be replaced by most centres in free agency and then some. The Warriors need to revamp their defence, and that starts with a rim protecting big. Depending on a rookie to anchor the defence isn't a good option. LaMelo at least has his playmaking and vision that should translate to the NBA, and he should have a high ceiling. He could also be used as a trading chip."

The warriors need big men, size, and defense. Lamelo provides none of that.

Lamelo also doesn’t fit into a system like that (nor has the shooting percentage for it). The warriors are in win now and Melo is not a win now pick"

Jordan Nwora or Immanuel Quickly should have been the pick there.

I voted for Vassell at 8 but this was 2 months ago, I'd switch that to Kira or Maxey today.

At 27 I'm ok with Riller but I'd prefer Jones, Joe, Bey or Ramsey. 

Just me being a Knicks fan and understanding the team needs as well as hearing what the FO and Coaches want, this makes the most sense"

As a UofL fan I have no idea why Jordan Nwora is projected to go so low.

What does Patrick Williams bring to the table that's raised his stock so high?"

21484,2020-11-02 15:51:24,jmminr,"Don't sleep on Yam Madar! As an israeli, after watching both of them play-  
In my opinion his ceiling is just as high as Deni Avdija's, and he his one year younger.  
He is already one of the best 1v1 defenders in the IBL (which is a very competitive and tough competition), and he has lots of heart and tenacity and he brings it on to the court.  


For example, against fierce rivals and top euro-league club, and after the starting PG was fouled out, in OT - he took charge and let Hapoel to victory ([https://youtu.be/np1ukLXirCw](https://youtu.be/np1ukLXirCw)

Anyway whoever drafts him will get a decent boost in jersey sales! Same goes for Deni - When Omri Casspi was drafted by the Kings so many people bought his shirt!"
21485,2020-11-02 17:11:20,jmminr,"I believe Tyrell Terry, Desmond bane, Kira Lewis jr and Tyler Bey have all seen a rise in their draft stock since this was polled, as well as vassal seeing his decrease a little. 

Also I know it’s like mid second round and it doesn’t matter but Devon Dotson shouldn’t go above his teammate Udoka Azubuike."
21486,2020-11-02 17:27:01,jmminr,"I don't understand why Warriors fans are so into the idea of Wiseman on the Warriors. I see it as a horrible fit, let alone not seeing Wiseman as the BPA. But he's clearly who Warrior fans want."

21493,2020-11-02 17:16:09,jmminr,Isaiah Stewart going to the kings would be appropriate as the kings used to be the Rochester royals and he grew up in Rochester.

21495,2020-11-02 14:05:23,jmminr,"avdija is the one player i really wouldn't want to take in the lottery, scouts seem to talk about him like he's a high ceiling low floor prospect but he can't shoot and is universally agreed to not be good enough to be an elite playmaker or defender - unless they're wildly wrong there's no value in picking him so high"

Edit: just saw we get Flynn too lmao"
21497,2020-11-02 15:25:42,jmminr,This is the worst draft since 2013 and possibly even 2000.  I'm sure a couple good players will come out of it but it likely won't be the ones at the top.  Wiseman is clearly the best prospect but his playstyle doesn't fit the modern NBA well enough to justify a top 3 pick if the draft was stronger.  Edwards and Ball have massive glaring flaws in their games.  I don't even anyone picking in the top 5.
21498,2020-11-02 16:32:39,jmminr,"That would be a terrible draft for the Magic. 
 
 
 
A 6'3"" SG that has no positives. Can't play PG at all. Has reputation as a shooter which he disproved in his one year of facing competition. Basically ""he was thought to be a shooter in high school"" FIRST ROUND PICK!!! 
 
Smallish, decent, but boring 2nd. Probably won't see the floor. 
 
Might as well say Orlando abstains from the 2020 draft."
21499,2020-11-02 14:50:14,jmminr,I think the Spurs are gonna move up for Avdija

21504,2020-11-02 19:17:53,jmminr,I’m interested to see what happens with Udoka Azubuike. I think he could be a great 5 off the bench for most teams. His mobility improved a lot over his Kansas career and while still not great isn’t terrible for his size.

Josh green would be great, don’t see him sipping. I think tyrese Maxey is the pick for someone who needs a guard. Lockdown, shoots the ball well and finishes with the best. Halliburton fits the gsw model so well, great passer smart guy"

21514,2020-11-02 16:49:41,jmminr,"Can someone explain why the Wolves don’t just move KAT to the four and draft Wiseman?

From what I’ve seen, Wiseman could be a great defensive anchor eventually and probably help us out immediately. I think KAT may actually be better at a stretch four spot.

Anthony Edwards is just gonna fight for minutes with JO and Malik and all three of these guys need minutes for development."
21515,2020-11-02 16:53:04,jmminr,NOLA getting 2 more duke players... sounds about right!

21517,2020-11-02 14:06:30,jmminr,Oof. I would NOT be happy with this pick. Avdija is on my do not draft list.
21518,2020-11-02 12:30:08,jmminr,Why would the Hawks take Haliburton? I never understand these mock drafts who have them taking a PG they already have Trae Young. Haliburton isn't even a good enough shooter where he can still be great without the ball.
21519,2020-11-02 16:10:42,jmminr,"My opinions and draft assumptions 

James wiseman shouldn’t be a top 10 pick.
Deni Avdija will go second.
Killian Hayes is the best player in draft and will win ROY and it won’t be close.
Sadiq Bey and Tyler Bey will be lottery picks. 
Cole Anthony will drops to late 20’s early second round. LaMelo Ball is already a top 10 passer in the NBA. Anthony Edwards is a solid scoring option but will never be an all star. Okoro, Okongu, Toppin are busts. Wiseman will be a serviceable big but ultimately a letdown. A large portion of draft will be successful role players with long careers. Will not go down as a weak draft but just one devoid of stars"
21520,2020-11-02 13:49:34,jmminr,"The middle of the draft is absolutely stacked. There's lacking star power up top but it's filled with very good role players imo.

I think from the middle even into the beginning of the 2nd round you can find quality role players and quality back ups"
21521,2020-11-03 00:27:06,jmminr,"that’s 100% right. It’s not a bad draft at all, it’s just lacking like two star-level prospects at the top. The late pick guys are really solid looking, there’s a ton of value to be had even into the 2nd round."
21522,2020-11-03 01:10:46,jmminr,"I think that has more to do with covid and the lack of typical player evaluation methods.

Normally, by the time the draft rolls around these guys have played a lot more games, they've been poked and prodded and run through workouts. And a general consensus emerges. But the lack of good data leads to wildly different evaluations."

There are other point guards but Hayes looks real solid, Knicks haven't had a good point guard in ages but I think they will do anything to get one this year.

21531,2020-11-02 14:56:11,jmminr,As a Knicks fan the reason we got nico in this was because I heavily campaigned for it in the comments
21532,2020-11-02 14:59:02,jmminr,You reckon your Cavs are going to take him? Can't see him being taken 1-4 tbh.
21533,2020-11-02 16:25:39,jmminr,"He’s a bust regardless of when he’s taken. His lack of lateral quickness and inability to switch defensively will be absolutely exploited by most teams. He can’t even rebound on top of that. He’s 22 with low potential, hes reliant on athletic ability and I personally don’t trust his 3 ball which would be his only saving grace if that keeps developing."
21534,2020-11-02 17:47:47,jmminr,"I can't see Okongwu slipping to 9, but hey, last year I didn't think Bol would slide past 20. 

As for Jones, second round is a bit of a crap shoot. You can go fit, but if think there's a good player at 37 you take the player. Also, Wall is coming off some serious injuries, Ish isn't a player you avoid drafting someone for, and isn't TBJ more of a wing than ball handler?"
21535,2020-11-02 14:00:08,jmminr,"Potential. He has a great frame, great wingspan, has potential to be a really really good defensive player. Shot well from the FT line which a lot of people use as a predictor in the ability to shoot 3s in the NBA. It's all about upside. Nwora has showed he can be a solid shooter but he's not very quick"
21536,2020-11-02 15:11:59,jmminr,Nwora knew this past season was a chance to add value to his stock.  He didn't seem to do that at all.
21537,2020-11-02 21:04:36,jmminr,"For Nwora - I think some teams might be inclined to take him higher than that but the concern with him is everything he does outside of shooting. He's strong, but not a very good athlete in terms of foot speed or leaping, which will harm him defensively if he plays as a small 4 and really harm him if he plays the 3. Little of his offense beyond shooting seems likely to translate - not going to break people down off the dribble or likely play-make beyond ""obvious"" passes. Has shown little in terms of either ball handling on the PnR or being an effective roll guy - maybe just pick and pop. The catch and shoot is a calling card, but hasn't been able to hit a ton off the dribble. To stick he's going to have to really kill catch and shoot looks, which he's done super well in college, but his mechanics look worse than someone like Duncan Robinson - his release point is lower and his shot is slower overall. I don't think the floater game / transition will be as available to him in the pros given the athletic step up. Defensively, actually a pretty good team defender and should be able to switch a PnR, but you'd worry about putting him on 3s and below who can challenge him off the dribble - more than anything offensively I think that will be his ""swing factor."""
21538,2020-11-02 13:41:55,jmminr,"Who you want them to take? Ball seems like a high risk, pretty decent reward prospect. In this draft tho that may be the best you get up high."

21543,2020-11-02 14:46:03,jmminr,Sounds like a win win. Team gets better and they lose a fairweather
21544,2020-11-02 13:49:00,jmminr,"I legit have no idea who Charlotte would want. Everybody says the top 3 prospects are Ball/Edwards/Wiseman but none of those guys are shooters and I feel like the Hornets need some more spacing.

If you're gonna take a risk on anyone would it be Deni? He seems like that star wing that Charlotte would really use. But all in all if they took any of the consensus top 3 I could find ways to rationalize it except for Wiseman. I get that Cody Zeller's an expiring but it seems like a waste to use such a high draft pick on him."
21545,2020-11-02 18:38:08,jmminr,Desmond Bane is a very good fit

21553,2020-11-02 19:04:06,jmminr,Chino Hills 2015-16.. IMO the best high school team of all time
21554,2020-11-02 20:12:34,jmminr,"he’s a tall PG with a great handle and incredible court vision. He’s got good physical tools so he could develop into a good defender (Simmons and Lonzo both were projected to not be good defenders lol). LaMelo’s atrocious shooting splits are more on shot selection. He’s a pretty good shooter off the catch(~38%), so the idea is hopefully with good coaching he can fix his shot selection and become much more efficient. 

Everyone in this draft has flaws, you can’t look for a perfect prospect. Edwards, the projected #1 pick, is extremely raw. He’s a great athlete but I could 100% see him bust. LaMelo has his flaws but they seem fixable (poor defensive effort and bad shot selection) with good coaching."
21555,2020-11-02 19:42:18,jmminr,"This draft is so terrible. Even Anthony Edwards is a huge project player who can't shoot. And NBA defense is always a crapshoot because of how different NBA offenses are. So I guess we just go for handles, court vision, and athleticism? Ball has like 2.5/3 at least."
21556,2020-11-02 14:35:48,jmminr,Look at this first round....you’re saying avdija isn’t a lottery pick this year?
21557,2020-11-02 15:52:54,jmminr,"Middle of the draft is actually really strong, it's just really weak at the top of the draft."
21558,2020-11-02 18:40:13,jmminr,"
>A 6'3"" SG that has no positives.

Bugging. His defense is great and half court shot creation is pretty good. His playmaking needs work but that's his biggest flaw. Every scout buys his shot. He shot 83% from the FT line and fixed a big issue over the summer with his shot which is his arc. Getting Maxey at 15 is a huge W. He's very similar to Jrue Holiday. I'd take him over Vassell at 8."
21559,2020-11-02 19:51:07,jmminr,We just want to draft and stash everyone apparently
21560,2020-11-02 17:19:50,jmminr,"Because KAT's a good rim protector and a bad everything else defender. He wouldn't be able to guard 4's and would be even more of a liability. The thing he's best at on defense, rim protection, would be negated by moving him to the 4."
21561,2020-11-02 17:29:54,jmminr,"How is KAT with perimeter defense? Wouldn't that lineup just get killed by a lot of smaller lineups? It'd work offensively, but that defense seems rough."
21562,2020-11-02 18:53:13,jmminr,"Wiseman and KAT both can’t guard on the perimeter. Look at how Embiid and Horford fit together on D, it’s like that but even worse."
21563,2020-11-02 14:56:02,jmminr,"I personally think Deni would be a huge W on the Bulls.

Why don't you like him?"
21564,2020-11-02 12:33:06,jmminr,He shot 43% from 3 as a freshman and 42% from 3 as a sophomore (5.6 3PA per game) also shot 82% from the free throw line this year. Dude is efficient
21565,2020-11-02 12:33:27,jmminr,Haliburton isn’t a pg in the NBA. He’ll be a secondary playmaker/ball handler.
21566,2020-11-02 12:58:40,jmminr,He can play on and off ball efficiently is the gist of it
21567,2020-11-02 16:36:41,jmminr,Wiseman shouldn't be top 10? a 19 year old 7 foot athlete? what is ur rationale
21568,2020-11-02 17:54:49,jmminr,"The extra time to workout away from college game helped a lot of kids raise their stock, work on their discrepancies, etc.

Almost all the kids that generally would be poor shooters are having decent turnarounds, with fixed shooting forms that are quicker, improved ball handling, improved physique at a time when they're still growing, etc. 99% of them are also healthy now.

Its a good time to fix your foundation with the help of a dedicated trainer. Better to do it now than in 3 years. Almost all the kids in this draft also have functional 3pt range, unlike former vets who had to add it to their game in their mid 20's."
21569,2020-11-03 06:21:09,jmminr,I would rather have Tyrell Terry than several guys in the top ten of this list.

21572,2020-11-02 22:00:55,jmminr,I see more potential and higher upside out of Killian than out of Brandon Knight

21574,2020-11-02 13:27:12,jmminr,"Yea idk made no sense to me. 

Tyler Bey at 27 works for the defense he brings. If he can develop the 3, he can be in the Jerami Grant mold. Would be valuable.

Isaiah Joe would be good at 27 for his shooting while Ramsey good for his shot creation.

Jones is a much better floor general and more well rounded compared to Riller.

Then at 38 Jordan Nwora for his stretch 4 potential

Everyone was just focused on getting us point guard after point guard and ignored every other need"

21577,2020-11-02 18:52:06,jmminr,"Most centres are less switchable than him. He’s fast, a great finisher, and a good shooter. Fits right in with the Warriors, I bet a team will trade with Warriors and get Wiseman, Lamelo, or Edwards while they take Obi."

21580,2020-11-02 15:15:58,jmminr,I get that he's 22 and he didn't have a major improvement over last season but the dude is a 6'7 wing who averaged 18/7.7 on .440/.402/.813 stats while taking 6 3PA a game. What about that line doesn't scream NBA ready?
21581,2020-11-02 14:03:17,jmminr,"I don't know why people have such a hate boner for LaMelo. If he's there at #3, there's not really an argument for anyone below him. He's the BPA there. He's a flawed prospect but it's a flawed draft, he still has a lot of potential."
21582,2020-11-02 14:41:01,jmminr,I’d rather trade the pick or shoot myself if the face. It’s a tough choice.
21583,2020-11-02 19:01:55,jmminr,There was actually a Blazers fan that went on a bunch of angry rants in r/ripcity a few years ago about how awful and doomed the franchise was. Then he wrote a big post about how he was leaving the fanbase for greener pastures and became a Sacramento Kings fan.

21598,2020-11-02 16:51:21,jmminr,"Really? Take a look at every star 5 in today’s game. They shoot, they pass, they switch on defence. Wiseman is similar to players like javale McGee or best case scenario players like Dwight Howard or DeAndre Jordan. These are the types of players who are getting benched more often in place of all around players like Bam and Anthony Davis. Then add the fact he had a shit attitude and barely gave a fuck in college. Then add the giant list of busts with almost the exact same description as him. I’m shocked so many mock drafts have him so high.

I even just looked at other opinions with most drafts listing his most common comparison as Hassan Whiteside. If Charlotte doesn’t take him 3rd then I see him dropping past 10"
21599,2020-11-02 17:33:20,jmminr,Or both could end up being busts and washing out in 2 years

But he also lost against the players you mentioned in the years before, it's not like he was a freshman last year. Let's face it he is a 22 year old, three almost four years older than some of the other prospects, that's gonna weigh against him."

21611,2020-11-02 15:25:30,jmminr,"He might be NBA ready, you're right.  But I could fill a bus with guys with his measurables that all have ""potential"". 

If I remember correctly, didn't he disappear against some of the better teams they played?  Seems like he padded a lot of his numbers against lower level competition.  Did he get off the bus vs UK and Duke?  I don't remember all the games so maybe he had a big game vs someone else good but I sort of remember those two games as ones he was seemingly absent."
21612,2020-11-02 15:27:09,jmminr,He has potential but he also doesn't make sense fit wise for Charlotte next to Devonte and Rozier. I also get that maybe they're not in position to draft based on fit but I'm not sure Ball is good enough to override fit concerns
21613,2020-11-02 14:07:14,jmminr,"Oh yeah for sure. I just think he has some big gaps in shooting and defense. Physically he definitely has the tools and is clearly skilled. The issue is will he commit on defense and create efficient offense. I’ve watched an hour or so worth of him in Australia and the dude takes some head scratcher shots. Hopefully we can see him get taken in by a good development team. Also as an outside fan, it would be fun seeing him just run the hornets offense"
21614,2020-11-02 14:27:33,jmminr,because people still have a hate boner for Lavar. people love anthony edwards who imo is just as flawed as melo.

21616,2020-11-02 14:24:35,jmminr,"reddit herd mentality. 

People said he has weakness as if every player in every draft doesn't. Like is he suppose to be the greatest player of all time before he's even in the league.   
Deandre Ayton had just as many weakness but you don't see nearly as much hate.

Lamelo's ""weakness"" is he shoots 28% from 3 on difficulty shot selection (which clearly means he will be 35% plus in his prime) 

and his defense  (even though he average 1.5 steals and is 6 foot 7 so a promise he will be a better defender than Steph, Lillard, Kyrie, Booker, Trae,  Lavine ect.

If Trae Young was 6 foot 7 and shot 10% worse from 3 is that not the number 1 pick?"
21617,2020-11-02 17:31:32,jmminr,You think there’s a chance New York would trade up to 3 if Ball is there? Maybe something like 8 and Mitch for 3?

21619,2020-11-02 15:07:06,jmminr,Nobody in this draft is 'reasonably' going to be an all star.  Thats why its such a crapshoot
21620,2020-11-02 16:06:24,jmminr,"Disagree, he's probably not falling past 5. He's more of jack of all trades (except for maybe free-throws) and master of none. He is one of the best playmakers in the draft though, and I personally think he's a high floor mediocre ceiling type of player.  If there are people who put Ball at #1 when Deni is more athletic, can defend, and rebound better, then Deni certainly is a high lottery pick in this draft. Maybe he falls past 9 in stronger drafts such as 2021, but he's right up there among the top 5 this year."
21621,2020-11-02 16:00:08,jmminr,"I bet most of those guys are guards though, which shows the value of a wing. You can pick up a solid guard late in the first this year but wings are still so valuable

Plus avdija played very well since the lockdown restart, something that college players haven’t been able to do"
21622,2020-11-02 18:53:34,jmminr,He's far from Mario. He's more like Lamar Odom or Andre Iggy (not as athletic as Iggy but he's still an athletic player)
21623,2020-11-02 16:30:09,jmminr,"Not to make the comparison but he’s shooting as well as Luka is from 3 with a similar skill set. Luka lite would be a steal In this draft

Not to mention his ability to switch defensively which is massive with the way nba is played now. I still think warriors pick him second if they don’t trade pick tho so don’t worry"
21624,2020-11-02 12:38:51,jmminr,"I just feel he could play off ball effectively, his bail handling doesn’t seem good enough in my eyes to picture him as a primary playmaker full time, I feel like playing off of trae would be beneficial"
21625,2020-11-02 12:37:07,jmminr,No team is taking him as their primary ball handler.
21626,2020-11-02 17:00:45,jmminr,"Thats fair, I agree hes got a limited skillset. I think with his age and his frame hes worth at least a top 10 pick especially in a weaker draft. Skills can be developed"
21627,2020-11-02 18:36:25,jmminr,Their potential to be star players is a lot higher than other guys in the 2nd imo. Will either of them become stars? Personally i don’t think so. I like Stanley a lot but see him being a really good 3rd/4th guy. Look at what Gilbert arenas said about Stanley. Quickley will likely end up in Europe but the fact that two guys with their potential are available among many other names in the 40-50 range is crazy. This draft is crazy deep with guys who could shock you.
21628,2020-11-02 22:09:29,jmminr,Well killian is a consensus top 2 point guard in this draft (potentially number over lamelo depending on how you see it) so im very happy that lamelo is valued so highly because it leads to killian dropping right into our hands
21629,2020-11-02 15:23:35,jmminr,RJ has good passing and playmaking for a wing. But i to watch him for one more season before i can say he can be a primary playmaker. Right now i can def see him as a secondary
21630,2020-11-02 15:22:47,jmminr,"No because Frank was our only young PG on the team before DSJ came, everyone else was an expiring. So getting a second PG on a rookie scale contract is fine because you can distribute the minutes between them both. 

With this mock we have 4 PG's. How are we distributing those minutes?"
21631,2020-11-02 15:28:26,jmminr,I don't agree that he's BPA tbh.
21632,2020-11-02 17:35:57,jmminr,"At the same time though, Lillard was an older rookie but that didn't hold him back. Or on a much smaller scale, Brogdon. Just depends on the player and how hard they are willing to work"
21633,2020-11-02 23:26:16,jmminr,"Obi is a better athlete and a better shooter, I actually think he's the safest pick in this draft. Dude is just good at basketball."
21634,2020-11-03 06:21:47,jmminr,I don’t think they are similar players at all.
21635,2020-11-02 18:59:32,jmminr,Devonte Graham and Terry Rozier are definitely not players you make drafting choices based on.
21636,2020-11-02 16:19:04,jmminr,"Rozier is only there for a good time, not a long one."
21637,2020-11-02 20:11:17,jmminr,"who tf cares about fit in Charlotte?? that team aint making any runs in the next 5 years, their will be a lot of turnover before that team becomes good"
21638,2020-11-02 16:57:01,jmminr,If you pick Ball at 3 the other two become pretty disposable.
21639,2020-11-02 18:05:45,jmminr,"There is never any excuse to not take the best available player. Take him, then trade him for a better fit *plus* something else."
21640,2020-11-02 20:17:13,jmminr,"Charlotte needs talent right now not fit, lol."
21641,2020-11-02 15:08:16,jmminr,Agreed. I think Anthony Edwards floor is so low. I can see him a complete bust and out of the league in 3 years. I just don't see that for Ball. I think (at worst) he'll be a good rotation player the next 10 years.
21642,2020-11-02 17:50:57,jmminr,he can shoot. ben simmons could never shoot.
21643,2020-11-02 17:58:01,jmminr,"He's a much better passer than Simmons. And he can operate the half court offense decently unlike Simmons cause he's atleast willing to shoot whether off screens or if you give him space.

You pray to god the kid has atleast tried to fix his shooting form (like all the other prospects working with trainers) and draft him expecting a future HoF nut job brat with a crazy father.....what am I saying, he's a powderkeg of a prospect, its all fucked."

21646,2020-11-02 20:09:10,jmminr,You'll take 8 and Beyblade and you'll like it.
21647,2020-11-02 18:57:57,jmminr,I dunno it's hard to gauge how good he'll be but I just don't think he has enough of a sample size to prove he'll translate to the NBA. He's not a 7'3 unicorn like porizingis and he's not a guy with a resume like luka prior to getting drafted.
21648,2020-11-02 18:46:12,jmminr,"He will never be a luka-lite. Deni played off the bench and luka was an MVP and champion by 18. Every euro prospect who was taken as a bench player has turned into a bust, not even joking there's a full list of them including guys like hezonja and darko."
21649,2020-11-02 20:25:28,jmminr,Luka shot a lot better from the free throw line (an indicator of ability to improve shooting). Luka was also an infinitely better passer. In now way is Avdija comparable to Luka.
21650,2020-11-02 12:48:59,jmminr,If NY or Detroit takes him you don't think he'll be a Point Guard?
21651,2020-11-02 12:41:50,jmminr,"Knicks will definitely use him as their primary ball handler maybe not day 1, but before the end of his rookie campaign. Same for the Pistons neither team is set at PG enough not to especially Detroit"
21652,2020-11-02 22:14:26,jmminr,">Well killian is a consensus top 2 point guard in this draft

I mean that doesn't hold a lot of weight in this comment thread considering Knight was also a consensus top 2 point guard :/

But still, I hope he works out"
21653,2020-11-02 16:09:04,jmminr,"Reminds me of Winslow in Miami before they got Jimmy Butler. If RJ cant spread the floor as a shooter, then the ball should be in his hands. Winslow played his best basketball ever as a left 6'6"" PG who cant really shoot but can drive"
21654,2020-11-02 15:33:38,jmminr,It's also a bit hard to judge since he doesn't have any shooters to pass to.
21655,2020-11-02 23:27:49,jmminr,"Why the fuck would the Knicks take another short, bad shooter if Nwora, the 2nd best shooter in the draft is still available."
21656,2020-11-02 17:51:21,jmminr,"I think people take more chances or  don't care as much in last few years, for example Heat take Duncan Robinson etc.
I honestly think we will see more ""older"" people getting picked for one reason or another as the time goes by.
I was reading a blog or post last week where the average ""free agent/lottery pick "" that was over 21 or 21+ had more value/did better then the young ones."
21657,2020-11-02 20:15:17,jmminr,"Also: why is it such a tremendously bad fit, anyway? Rozier can and has played off-ball a lot in his career, and Graham hit 42% of catch-and-shoot threes last year. Having two playmakers on the court can also be... good?

It might not be what you'd put together from scratch but it wouldn't be, like, incoherent."
21658,2020-11-02 18:01:13,jmminr,"Fr who cares about Rozier, that’s trade piece #2"
21659,2020-11-02 16:00:41,jmminr,"Er kind of disagree. Edwards at least has insane athleticism to compensate for his flaws. If everything goes wrong for the two, Ball will  be a 3rd stringer pg due to fact that he can't shoot and defend at the NBA level. Edwards on the hand could be a back-up sg. It's blatantly clear that Ball has the lowest floor and one of the highest ceilings in the draft."
21660,2020-11-02 22:11:41,jmminr,Worst case scenario Lamelo is just Michael Carter Williams skill level with Ball family attitude and baggage. Thats out of the league in 3 years talk to me
21661,2020-11-02 18:26:06,jmminr,Can he? His pro career so far certainly doesn't show it.
21662,2020-11-02 19:08:44,jmminr,He’s a much better passer than one of the best passers in the league?
21663,2020-11-02 19:21:55,jmminr,"> He's a much better passer than Simmons.

Um what? Ben simmons has ranked top 10 twice and top 20 once in his 3 years in the NBA in assist percentage. Averages for his career 8 apg. He is conservatively one of the best 20 passes in the NBA. To say that a rookie playing in Australia is a better passer than him is ludicrous."
21664,2020-11-02 15:05:38,jmminr,The NBL is a tier above the NCAA. They're all pros afterall and most of them played in the NCAA too. And I think they got some former NBA guys playing over there as well. So Lamelo played in a much tougher league than Ayton did.
21665,2020-11-02 14:54:16,jmminr,"28% from 3 including his 1 preseason game according to realgm
28% making shots like this 
https://youtu.be/xNMvIZFLuRQ?t=67
is different than MKG being left open shooting the same percentage.
 Luka and Draymond shoot the same percentage from 3 for their career. 
But who's the better shooter?

Ayton averaged more turnovers than assist and wasn't a great defender in college either. But no one considered him to have ""major weakness""

College basketball is a much weaker league than Australia it's not even close. The worst team in Australia was the Lamelos's team and they had a top 5 pick and 3 former NBA Players. Every team in Australia would be ranked in the top 25 of college basketball.
Lamelo's shooting splits were low because he had to take so many bad shot carrying his bad team."
21666,2020-11-02 16:05:27,jmminr,I think he could function in that role for a little while but it wouldn’t be his strong suit necessarily. Needs to build up his pick and roll skills and ball handling before he can be a full time one. I think he’ll be more effective playing off the ball at least at the beginning of his career
21667,2020-11-02 12:52:57,jmminr,Knicks want a shot creator at the 1. They said this months ago. Haliburton is not that
21668,2020-11-02 13:41:14,jmminr,"Haliburton seems like a great secondary playmaker guy to put next to Trae Young. Either him or Killian Hayes can be that offball guy. My guess on why Haliburton projects higher is because Hayes has a sub-30 three point percentage? 

I think the projected landing spots for Haliburton and Hayes are valid. If New York can't grab either then I expect them to throw a ton of money at FVV. Assuming Vassel's shot translates over then he'd be a good grab as well since they need to surround RJ with shooters."
21669,2020-11-02 22:17:05,jmminr,"Youre looking at it the wrong way, he's a guaranteed top 2 of this class, but you can also make a very good case for him being the number 1 point guard. People are undervaluing him by letting him fall out of top 5 territory and as a pistons fan, I love to hear it"
21670,2020-11-02 17:29:50,jmminr,"Winslow is actually a good comparison, some good tools there but it's really unclear what it might look like if he puts it all together"
21671,2020-11-02 16:00:10,jmminr,"What are you talking about, we had **checks notes** uh... marcus morris for half a season?"

21673,2020-11-02 23:48:41,jmminr,"exactly what im thinking. Arguable if Nwora is the 2nd best shooter, he definitely is up there with the best and fills a need as a shooter in the 3-4 spot."
21674,2020-11-02 16:06:31,jmminr,Lamelo would still have elite passing and a very good handle though. At worst he can be a backup pg who is the primary ballhandler for a bench unit. Edwards doesn't bring any elite skill. All he brings is his physical profile.
21675,2020-11-02 22:01:39,jmminr,The reading rainbow
21676,2020-11-02 19:43:02,jmminr,"Assists ain't everything. Hes a very good passer but he's not all that in the half court.

21679,2020-11-02 18:15:00,jmminr,RJ Barrett will be better than that imo but if he was on my team I would want to try him more as a lead playmaker with finishers and shooters around him
21680,2020-11-02 23:56:43,jmminr,"Nesmith is the only guy I'd feel confident saying is better. Nwora shoots 40% from 3 on pretty high volume, and 80% from the line. 6'7, average athlete, I think he's going to be a really great 25 mpg rotation guy for a long time."
21681,2020-11-02 16:12:39,jmminr,"Edwards also has a good handle while being a better shooter than Ball (albeit both of them have bad shot-selection). I think Edwards at worst will be a smaller Wiggins, which will probably be a backup sg. Unless I see Ball  improve his shooting, his lack of shot creation will hinder his playmaking abilities. Although I'll proudly eat my words if I'm wrong. Ball is certainly one of the most unique prospects we have in this draft, but he just has a ton of flaws to overcome."

21684,2020-11-02 15:19:04,jmminr,"Well yeah I think Ayton would really be a good player. He afterall will be an important matchup against future incoming and current bigs the NBA has. (I don't believe bigmen are becoming extinct)

I just really disagreed with the NCAA being better than the NBL thing. A league full of college players against a league full of pros suplemented with former NBA players and some Euroleaguers(?).

Doesn't Duke and Kentucky lose to more experienced teams deep in the run/playoffs,(?) those are just players who have been playing together longer and more development. Imagine them up against teams with much more experience and even talent.

And I'm not biased since I'm not Australian or a Ball fan just wanna put that out there."
21685,2020-11-02 16:23:53,jmminr,"> the P5 conferences are the best other than the NBA and the Euroleague.

The G-League is 100% better competition than the P5. There are tons of great P5 players that are playing in the G-League that are older and more developed."
21686,2020-11-02 15:19:41,jmminr,"There is no mental gymnastics and the Luka Draymond comparison was just too perfect and you had no comeback for it.

A more ""complete prospect"" isn't a better prospect.
Ayton was drafted over Luka for the same reasons. He seemed to have less weaknesses whereas Luka had way more uncertainty.
People were uncertain about how much better euroleague competition was. (Nemanja Bjelica and Nandi De Colo were euroleague MVPS and below average in the league)
Uncertain about Luka shooting 33% from 3
Unathletic 
Bad defense 
Sound familiar?
Not saying he's as good as a prospect as Luka but the idea of an 18 year old who may already be a top 5 passing and rebounding PG who also will be able to play better defense than many all star guards and averaged 17 ppg in a pro league isn't a number one pick is ridiculous."
21687,2020-11-03 00:03:20,jmminr,"Nesmith, Vassell, Joe, Bane, Nwora, Haliburton all shoot very well. It's hard to say who's the best out of the group. I think Joe might be the best pure shooter of the bunch. I know his numbers are down from his freshman year but he has the most mechanically sound shot and moves so well without the ball"
21688,2020-11-03 00:27:10,jmminr,"You don't need 2 years hoping and praying LaMelo busts while Simmons continues his semi-mediocre campaign as a highly lauded #1 overall pick.

I don't think I'd put Vassel up there tbh, a lot less volume than the others, and about a 10% ft dropoff to the next couple guys. Either way, lots of good options for teams that need to fill in with a couple shooters. I think Nwora would actually be a great pickup for OKC. He fits their timetable and they don't need to hit a homerun, they need a wing they can pair with Roberson and Dort to add spacing."

Kind of like how “reddit” is typically white men and you see the most random stuff across their various subreddits, so this is a black man’s tiny space of the same. 

Why women have more specific topics? They’re a minority group compared to black men. Also statistically women are more educated then men. So the cycle repeats."

I also said to myself “another woman running a subreddit for black men” but u/theyellowrose and team are doing an good job at letting this subreddit be a place for all Black Men to come and express themselves. I also like the subreddit title of r/blackmen anything BLM to me right now brings with it too much baggage meaning other issues that affect the discussion environment. 

In regards to you comments on how this subreddit is run, I personally try not to put others down to advance my agenda so I absolutely agree with the rules of this subreddit specifically 4. 

If you want to talk about black men then do it, start a topic, post something before you criticize and see what happens. 

You need to do some self-reflection if you do not think you have Power or Control over what you say and do. 

The last bit is some gatekeeping stuff. Anyway enjoy your subreddit hope it works out for you."

This may have been made by a woman but men have taken over. Fact is just because it’s a subreddit with black men doesn’t mean were going to quote Malcom and Garvey all day. There is more to being black than that. What you’re looking for is /r/blackfellas."

21741,2020-10-29 13:15:10,jk127n,"Group 1:
Bane, Green, Maledon, Ramsey
-- Very interesting group, could realistically have any order here, but I like Bane's shooting more than Green's athleticism and defensive potential.

Group 2:
Reed, Bey, Perry, Woodard
-- This group, I honestly don't know what to feel about them. I don't rate any of them particularly high, but I like Reed's upside quite a bit. I'm tempted to switch Perry with Bey, but Bey's defense projects to be pretty good.

Group 3:
Tillman, Oturu, Carey, Stewart, Azubuike
-- Tillman is a legitimately good prospect, if he were 6'10"", he'd be a lottery prospect imo. Last four are pretty interchangeable, Oturu probably has a slight edge over the last three so I put him #2. All of them should at least be backup bigs.

Group 4: (bear with me, this is very hot take-y)
Lewis, Maxey, Terry, Hayes, Anthony
-- Not sure why people are so high on Hayes, honestly. He's actually good, but I don't find myself overly wowed by him. And yet some people have him top-five in this class. Let's agree to disagree.

Kira Lewis is a top-ten prospect imo, maybe even closer to 5 but I don't wanna get too spicy, wouldn't be surprised to see him go #7. Have him as the third best PG in this class behind LaMelo and Halliburton. 

Maxey feels like a legit starting PG, though I think him and Hayes are actually pretty similar. Trust his jumper more.

Anthony is the wild card of the class, but while I'm enamored by his potential, there's a good chance he flames out like DSJ.

Group 5:
Joe, Flynn, Winston, Mannion, Jones

-- Joe is a top-two shooter in this class, interchangeable with Desmond Bane. Easily the best of this group. Everyone else outside of Flynn is a second round prospect.

Speaking of Flynn, very well-rounded PG. Great off-the-dribble scorer, good passer, good defensive instincts and very high-effort on that end. Should be a late first, probably closer to early second.

Winston is an excellent shooter and a pretty good floor general. Very good low-upside, high-floor guy in the second.

Mannion is the biggest boom-or-bust guy in this group, in that I can see him outshining Joe if he hits his best outcome bc he's such a gifted passer and has exceptional scoring potential, but man he looked like ass this year.

Not a fan of Tre. Don't rate him very highly at all.

Group 6:
Poku, McDaniels, Hampton 
-- The gap between Poku and McDaniels isn't very big imo. But the gap between them two and Hampton is MASSIVE. Not a fan of Hampton, I can understand if Poku and McDaniels both go top 15, I'd be appalled if Hampton is off the board anywhere before 24."

2) Reggie Perry, Paul Reed, Tyler Bey // Robert Woodard, I really like Perry touch. I think he has more potential as shooter and passer than what we can think just looking at the stats. I see him like some people see Tillman, smart and skilled big man. Reed and Bey are also interesting prospects thanks to their defense. I don't like Woodard both in interview and on court.  
3) Vernon Carey // Daniel Oturu, Udoka Azubuike, Isaiah Stewart, Xavier Tillman, big Carey fan. Others guys are okayish. I'm wondering if I underestimate Stewart. His stats weren't worse than the others but he is way younger  
4) Cole Anthony, Killian hayes // Kira Lewis Jr, Tyrell Terry, Tyrese Maxey, bunch of good players but nothing crazy good to me. Anthony and Hayes ahead for their better ability to create space.  
5) Nico Mannion, Malachi Flynn // Tre Jones, Isaiah Joe, Cassius Winston, Mannion didn't have a good year but I have him 1st for his potential in shooting and playmaking. I kinda like Flynn but not sure if he can be a starter. I see Jones, Joe and Winston as bench guys.  
6) Jaden McDaniels, Aleksej Pokusevski // R.J. Hampton, very close for me between Mc Daniels and Poku with Hampton a little behind. However I think Hampton is the safest of the 3."

I think he’s shown enough to warrant a pick especially this late as a potential 3 and D guy. I would wager that he’s likely to get more run that Mann or Kabengele as well so he’s my guy."
21760,2020-10-29 03:48:38,jjmeri,"They are win now, so I think there's a good chance they run it back with a new coach and hopefully no bubble. I voted for N'Doye because maybe he's a stash, G-league, two-way at best, but he could turn into a contributor in a year or two or three, when they have no first round picks.

The nets aren’t really likely to expect anything from this pick so the potential shooting gravity and shooting off of movement that Merrill can give (along with a guy like Harris if they resign him) could be found money for Brooklyn.

21812,2020-10-25 23:33:42,jhyc1e,Great.... Madea is gonna make a cameo 🤦‍♂️
21813,2020-10-25 20:37:14,jhyc1e,"But the question that I want answered is whether or not he’s gonna wear his comic costume with the pointy mask.

If Wanda can do it then he certainly can."
21814,2020-10-26 00:14:44,jhyc1e,Tyler Perry doing big things out here. Big congratulations to him.
21815,2020-10-26 01:19:23,jhyc1e,"I always wished they would have a Hawkeye movie, but at least his character is getting something."
21816,2020-10-26 17:15:11,jhyc1e,"I’m hyped for the show, but from what I’ve seen they’re gonna be following the Matt Fraction run pretty closely. It’ll be good, but I don’t think that MCU Clint is anywhere remotely the character that Fraction’s Clint is"
21817,2020-10-26 01:35:46,jhyc1e,"So this is probably because of logistic issues. Right now Spiderman 3 and Dr. Strange 2 are being filmed at Pinewood Studios. Pinewood Studios is where Marvel usually films their movies at, which is south of Atlanta. They probably reached out to Tyler Perry Studios to use their lot due to COVID restrictions and trying to play catch up with their schedule. This way Kevin Feige and the Walt Disney Company can keep better oversight on their projects and can assist in any ways of dealing with pressing challenges."
21818,2020-10-26 01:06:09,jhyc1e,"Is he going to require it be called ""Tyler Perry's Hawkeye""?"
21819,2020-10-26 02:15:07,jhyc1e,"Have they even announced any casting for this show? Like aside from jeremy renner playing hawkeye, whose actually cast in this show. For a show in preproduction that is (according to the article) looking to start production after thanksgiving, it seems weird that they havent announced a confirmed actress for kate bishop"
21820,2020-10-26 02:41:21,jhyc1e,"Bro. Pizza dog, bro. Bro bro bro."
21821,2020-10-26 12:32:10,jhyc1e,"Lmao the replies on this thread are hilarious. You guys do realise that Tyler Perry Studios is fucking massive (bigger than Disney and Warner Brothers combined) and many productions other than Tyler Perry's have taken place there, right?"
21822,2020-10-26 20:54:59,jhyc1e,"Er mah Jesus Cliff, ya name Cliff or Clint, you bettah get the hell up out my house with them arrows or I'ma lose my cool, praise the lerd"
21823,2020-10-26 23:13:39,jhyc1e,"I'm still blown away the guy who made ""Diary of a Mad Black Woman"" ended up making all the Madea movies. He stepped away from quality into quantity for sure. No doubt film paid more than theater. I like to think the team will do fine with this project though."
21824,2020-10-25 19:33:45,jhyc1e,Sweet! Hopefully they will have some location shots in Georgia that I can visit sometime. I had a lot of fun visiting Walking Dead locations when I was in Georgia for work years ago.
21825,2020-10-26 01:14:12,jhyc1e,Hold up I was looking at this posts and reading the comments about Madea when all of a sudden I hear Madea’s voice come on the tv downstairs
21826,2020-10-26 01:25:17,jhyc1e,"That concept art image reminds me of the movie God Bless America directed by Bobcat Goldthwaite, super good and I highly recommend and now I want this series to be all about Hawkeye, dying of cancer, going around and trying to leave the world better than he found it."
21827,2020-10-25 20:15:51,jhyc1e,"Madea goes to Wakanda.

It really takes place entirely in Tyler Perry's house, but they have unrelated exterior shots of Wakanda sprinkled throughout.

&#x200B;

Also, one of the characters was sexually assaulted by Wakandan royalty, but nobody ever really mentions it again."

21829,2020-10-26 02:20:24,jhyc1e,"Honestly, Perry is a great actor when he tries. I wouldn’t mind him showing up in the MCU. Heck, he could be Grills in the Hawkeye show."
21830,2020-10-25 19:18:17,jhyc1e,Please no

21833,2020-10-26 04:29:23,jhyc1e,There just isn't enough casual racism in the MCU so I could see why they would want Tyler Perry
21834,2020-10-26 02:32:32,jhyc1e,"No joke, I would watch the shit out of a Hawkeye and Madea team up."
21835,2020-10-25 20:37:04,jhyc1e,Love it!
21836,2020-10-25 18:58:18,jhyc1e,"Say what you will about his films, but he's more successful than everyone in this sub combined. Pretty good in Gone Girl, too."
21837,2020-10-27 01:40:07,jhyc1e,Google what films at his studios. It’ll surprise you.
21838,2020-10-25 21:21:14,jhyc1e,"Extremely successful black filmmaker who made low-brow comedies a la Adam Sandler, but has lately expanded into some dramatic roles (e.g. Gone Girl), as well as producing capacity for young filmmakers. He also recently became a billionaire I believe.    
Tyler Perry Studios started in 2019 and was converted from an old 330 acre military complex. It’s the biggest film studio in the US, as well as the first black-owned studio in the US."
21839,2020-10-25 21:19:32,jhyc1e,It’s just a studio. Tyler Perry will not be involved.
21840,2020-10-25 21:44:47,jhyc1e,"I'm not sure the ""Tyler Perry"" part is the significant part of the announcement, they used the studios for Black Panther before. I think it's more that Hawkeye's set to start filming.

But Tyler Perry is best known for being Madea. He's probably made more money as a black man dressed up as a woman than RuPaul.

But he parlayed that success into having one of the largest studio locations in America.

Edit: I guess it's like ""What if Barry Humphreys used his Dame Edna money to create Pinewood Studios"" or something."
21841,2020-10-25 20:34:15,jhyc1e,It’s probably best to just google it.
21842,2020-10-26 08:55:09,jhyc1e,"We tend not to know much about Tyler Perry mainly because his movies don’t get theatrical releases here. They’re laser focused in their target audience: black Americans. 

They usually don’t even get used to pad out streaming services’ libraries."
21843,2020-10-26 02:12:35,jhyc1e,It probably takes long while to actually logically lift your entire production base out of one city and to another area of the country.
21844,2020-10-27 01:45:57,jhyc1e,Seemed to increase once everything died down. Also:https://deadline.com/2020/10/pinewood-atlanta-rebrands-trilith-completes-separation-from-uk-expands-studio-adjacent-planned-community-1234592816/
21845,2020-10-26 02:36:41,jhyc1e,Bro. Bro bro bro. Bro.
21846,2020-10-26 07:57:39,jhyc1e,"Of all the Disney+ shows, I’m most hyped for Hawkeye. I’m sure there are a lot of people who feel the same way. It’s just that we’re all a quiet bunch."
21847,2020-10-25 19:15:27,jhyc1e,All those shows were announced at the same time. FAWS was originally supposed to be the first one released. Loki and Hawkeye were supposed to be released later.
21848,2020-10-26 01:51:38,jhyc1e,"perhaps Loki and Hawkeye were always supposed to be Disney+ shows, while there was some consideration on whether to put story elements into Black Widow, Cap 4?, and DS2, or go all in on other Disney+ shows."
21849,2020-10-26 07:56:27,jhyc1e,What do you mean? All of the Phase 4 movies and shows are announced on the same day at SDCC.
21850,2020-10-25 23:00:33,jhyc1e,WV was able to film faster because it has less episodes. loki is connected either to antman 3 it seems like with the time variance association
21851,2020-10-26 01:51:45,jhyc1e,"I'd love to see a bunch of civilians running from an explosion and cut to Madea screaming ""OH HELL NO"" for a split second"
21852,2020-10-28 20:49:22,jhyc1e,But Wanda is doing it in magical alternate realities whereas Hawkeye will all but certainly be a little more grounded. I understand the appeal for comic accuracy but it's akin to putting the gangster character from Looney Tunes in Goodfellas.
21853,2020-10-26 02:40:27,jhyc1e,Im just super excited that it looks to be heavily influenced by the matt fraction run
21854,2020-10-26 01:21:11,jhyc1e,"it was gonna be a movie, then D+ came along and they changed plans"
21855,2020-10-26 01:50:20,jhyc1e,"DS2 is in the UK, but yeah Covid has upended production schedules everywhere and studio space was already hard to come by and highly competitive."
21856,2020-10-26 01:53:26,jhyc1e,good point. using multiple studios in the same state probably makes travel and covid logistics much easier to deal with.
21857,2020-10-26 02:33:43,jhyc1e,Yes. Yes he is.
21858,2020-10-26 02:33:29,jhyc1e,"Trades should start dropping some casting news in the coming weeks.  Marvel themselves isn't really in the business of announcing things officially outside of cons.

As for Kate Bishop, it should be Hailee Steinfeld, but that's not getting reported yet for some reason."
21859,2020-10-26 02:15:50,jhyc1e,Only Jeremy Renner so far
21860,2020-10-26 17:16:12,jhyc1e,"It was reported that someone was cast as the Mime a few months back, but I’m sure we should take it with a grain of salt"
21861,2020-10-25 21:24:07,jhyc1e,"Plenty of Marvel locations to visit in Atlanta already. Scenes from Endgame, Infinity War, Antman 1 & 2, Civil War, Black Panther, and Spider-Man: Homecoming shot here. Falcon and Winter soldier too but we obviously don’t know what yet. And that’s not even considering all the other stuff that’s shot here like Stranger Things, Fast and Furious, Hunger Games, Jumanji and tons more."
21862,2020-10-25 22:35:41,jhyc1e,"Disney is weird about filming locations. Last year they threatened to pull all filming out of Georgia over an abortion law but they also didn’t mind filming in an area with concentration camps in China. 

It’s all very odd."
21863,2020-10-25 22:56:58,jhyc1e,I actually might watch madea goes to wakanda if it was a thing hahha
21864,2020-10-26 04:52:10,jhyc1e,omg you've actually SEEN Tyler Perry films.
21865,2020-10-26 07:33:13,jhyc1e,Well they did use his facilities in the filming of Black Panther. But that news came out before we knew he was building a whole town to film in.  I hope we don't see the same 5 brick buildings over and over.
21866,2020-10-26 01:17:17,jhyc1e,Does that make Madea the new Stan Lee?
21867,2020-10-25 20:22:41,jhyc1e,"He's a good actor and a real smart businessman. Say what you will about him, but he has never forgotten his rots, and reinvested all his success back into a new generation of young black filmmakers. And, uhh, a trillion dollar media juggernaut."
21868,2020-10-25 20:25:11,jhyc1e,He definitely wasn’t bad in Gone Girl
21869,2020-10-25 20:17:42,jhyc1e,False! The Russo bros have been known to be in this sub Reddit. So...he’s more successful than almost everyone in this sub combined
21870,2020-10-25 23:15:46,jhyc1e,"Say what you will about Tyler Perry at all, I feel a lot better about he and his company making money off Marvel Studios than the godawful Cathy family who owns Pinewood Studios."
21871,2020-10-26 01:31:19,jhyc1e,He took care to own everything.
21872,2020-10-26 01:35:57,jhyc1e,"This! He gets so much shit for medea, but i was pleasantly surprised by how good his acting is in  Gone Girl"
21873,2020-10-26 02:48:50,jhyc1e,Arnold Schwarzenegger joins the sub
21874,2020-10-25 21:45:38,jhyc1e,He was in the Star Trek reboot too. Small part but he did well.
21875,2020-10-26 01:05:43,jhyc1e,He was bloody brilliant in Gone Girl.
21876,2020-10-26 00:37:09,jhyc1e,Not sure how that is relevant to anything
21877,2020-10-25 23:33:38,jhyc1e,They still suck
21878,2020-10-25 23:14:03,jhyc1e,"Yes! I honestly dont know much about Tyler Perry but from what Ive heard he seems like a great guy, similar to Sandler as you said. I like that a guy like that owns the biggest film studio in the US. He will make it count"
21879,2020-10-26 01:25:44,jhyc1e,"> lately expanded into some dramatic roles (e.g. Gone Girl)

Lately? Gone Girl (2014) was 6 years ago

It's almost like he did a serious role to prove to people he could do it, and then decided he couldn't be fucked anymore."
21880,2020-10-26 03:53:20,jhyc1e,"Yeah, got to give him credit, he just wouldn't give up and eventually made it big.  My old boss used to manage his private island, said he was a very friendly guy."
21881,2020-10-26 01:10:40,jhyc1e,I put the the Fire alarm in those sound stages!!!! It was probably the coolest job I’ve done
21882,2020-10-25 21:59:59,jhyc1e,"Exactly. It’s because Loki, Ms Marvel and Spider-Man are all shooting at Pinewood, where marvel usually shoots. So there’s just no stage space for Hawkeye."
21883,2020-10-26 01:50:33,jhyc1e,All Tyler Perry Studio productions are subject to surprise inspections by Madea herself
21884,2020-10-26 23:09:14,jhyc1e,Hawk... guy?
21885,2020-10-25 19:46:34,jhyc1e,"Loki and Hawkeye were announced as in development for Netflix tv shows in 2016. I remember it clearly. It was before FAWS and WandaVision were announced. Even Renner said there were talks about his own tv show in 2016.

You can search this very subreddit and see people making their own posters for the Loki show after the news broke for him in 2013.

WandaVision and FAWS weren't in development until DisneyLife testing proved to be a good way to market in 2017. It was decided to transition into Disney+ in 2018 and formally launch in 2019. WV and F/WS are newer ideas compared to Hawkeye and Loki."
21886,2020-10-26 02:09:11,jhyc1e,That can very much be true
21887,2020-10-26 08:12:58,jhyc1e,"CC 2019 had many shows and movies announced for Phase 4

Which of those shows had any mention before 2017 tho? Not WV nor F/WS.

That is my point. Hawkeye and Loki have been talked about since the Netflix days in 2016. I don't know why this is difficult to grasp"
21888,2020-10-25 23:30:35,jhyc1e,"Yup, Ant Man 3 isn't exactly part of Phase 4 so far, so Loki doesn't need to arrive as early"
21889,2020-10-26 04:08:42,jhyc1e,"Wandavision was able to film faster because it was easier for them to restart filming during the pandemic. TFAWS had to go abroad and do a bunch of other stuff whereas Wandavision is less people and more contained.

All the shows will be 6 episodes."
21890,2020-10-26 02:05:39,jhyc1e,"A cameo we don’t deserve but we’re gonna get anyways 😂 

I don’t know why Disney’s studio in Georgia, doesn’t want Hawkeye to film there lol"
21891,2020-10-26 00:25:14,jhyc1e,Atlanta is Hollywood East now.
21892,2020-10-26 00:49:02,jhyc1e,"Not really. It's all about PR and what they think they can get away with. They would have never threatened to pull out of Georgia if they thought it wouldn't significantly damage their brand to be there.

Meanwhile most people in the US don't really care about human rights violations in China despite saying they do."
21893,2020-10-25 23:09:47,jhyc1e,meanwhile amazon is probably the biggest profiteers off of chinese labor yet no ones outraged and most dont care
21894,2020-10-27 01:49:16,jhyc1e,They have their own studio in ATL too right off 285 sw side. Star Girl (cw?) and other things are filmed there.
21895,2020-10-26 01:14:17,jhyc1e,"If it's not in the mind of the US and Western minds then they don't care about it. This is how most if not all big companies operate. It's like how recently a lot of big companies publicly supported BLM yet still have big shares owned by China (and any big company in China is basically CCP owned) which commit atrocities and doesn't care about human rights.

Just how it is 🤷‍♀️"
21896,2020-10-25 23:07:54,jhyc1e,Hallelujurr.
21897,2020-10-26 01:05:04,jhyc1e,"I feel like this is one of those things that if we meme it hard enough, they'll actually at least have a nod to it. I deadass wouldn't be satisfied if we don't get something at least like an after credits scene where she crosses the barrier, alerts security, and when they all surround her, she just starts going off."
21898,2020-10-26 01:21:08,jhyc1e,Is that even a question now?
21899,2020-10-25 21:12:19,jhyc1e,"I’ve got a special level of respect for people like Tyler Perry and Adam Sandler. They might not make the most quality works, but they’re living the life"
21900,2020-10-26 14:51:36,jhyc1e,"Yeah and I mean, the guy doesn't like playing Madea really anymore and just wants that chapter to be closed forever. I think that's what people mostly see him as, but he is certainly far more than what the public's perception is."
21901,2020-10-27 11:12:31,jhyc1e,"Georgia local, Tyler Perry has done loads for the city of Atlanta, and he largely goes unnoticed. He donates and tries to help without much recognition."
21902,2020-10-25 20:25:20,jhyc1e,"The Russos have made a lot of money for Disney, but they don't own their own studio."
21903,2020-10-25 22:46:21,jhyc1e,"Pretty sure he’s more successful than the Russos, he is worth over a billion dollars after all."
21904,2020-10-26 20:29:19,jhyc1e,Tyler Perry is worth $800 million..
21905,2020-10-25 23:20:04,jhyc1e,he is still more successful.
21906,2020-10-26 18:03:04,jhyc1e,A lot of people complain about Tyler Perry every time he's mentioned
21907,2020-10-25 23:16:28,jhyc1e,He locked his employees out when they started asking about unionization or something along those lines and made blacksploitation movies that kind of perpetuate stereotypes in Black America. It’s kind of a wash tbh
21908,2020-10-26 03:14:52,jhyc1e,"And he was completely forgettable in it, honestly."
21909,2020-10-26 01:26:15,jhyc1e,Fuck it felt like yesterday...
21910,2020-10-25 20:17:40,jhyc1e,"They may have been rumored, but I dont think Marvel ever officially announced them in 2016."
21911,2020-10-26 02:48:53,jhyc1e,Lol none of this happened. The first we’ve ever heard about MCU shows was in late 2018 when Variety reported that Disney+ shows are in development for Loki and Scarlet Witch. After that the other shows were reported on bit by bit
21912,2020-10-25 20:36:40,jhyc1e,"> Netflix films

Similar to how in Homecoming, there's a sign in Korean for a church dedicated to Thor."
21920,2020-10-26 00:35:55,jhyc1e,"I’m not the fan of his films but the fact that Adam Sandler made a major career out of shooting stupid movies with his friends has to be respected, and then shows up and actually acts every few years to prove if he wanted he could actually be good."
21921,2020-10-26 00:41:37,jhyc1e,I'm sure adam sandler made a deal with the devil to make one fantastically brilliant film every 10 years but every other film between them is absolute dogshit....

21924,2020-10-26 01:02:31,jhyc1e,I wouldn't be in any position to throw shade at the Russo bros but Tyler Perrys approach and how he side stepped the system is nothing short of genius.
21925,2020-10-26 00:19:15,jhyc1e,But it’s combined. I hope the entire sub plus russos can make the difference. Who knows though. I was just playing
21926,2020-10-26 20:52:14,jhyc1e,The person said combined. As long as everyone in this sub has $800 (some won’t buy others will have way more) we are more combined. We can do it Reddit!

Years later, when DisneyLife tested properly, they added WV and F/WS to that bundle for Disney+. By the time the Con came about, they dropped the bomb that Marvel TV wasn't handling production and it was Marvel Studios doing it.

I remember because I was surprised WV and F/WS were even up for tv and not for their own movies. Search Hiddleston and ""tv show"" before 2018. You'll see that they've been talking to him about the show they've been developing for a while"
21931,2020-10-25 20:39:56,jhyc1e,"Yeah that's a slip up, meant Netflix tv shows"

21936,2020-10-26 01:22:10,jhyc1e,I'd agree but Pixels was a real neat concept when it was just a Youtube video and I was pretty intrigued when they said it was going to become a whole movie. I have since soured on it for obvious reasons.

21952,2020-10-25 21:32:09,jhyc1e,"This is a dumb argument but the “measure of success” could be interpreted a bunch of ways. For instance; the russos have 3 movies that have each, individually grossed more than Tyler Perry’s entire library twice over."
21953,2020-10-25 21:37:59,jhyc1e,"Exactly, mentioning wanting to have a show about a specific character is different than officially announcing a new tv or streaming series."
21954,2020-10-25 21:35:50,jhyc1e,"His original statement was a reply to mine. What he is replying to is that Loki and Hawkeye being in development before F/WS and WV.

There is nothing incorrect about Loki and Hawkeye being in development before the other 2 shows. Look at interviews after Avengers, Tom, Feige and Renner have all mentioned it.

F/WS and WV didn't have anything until late 2017. None of the actors mentioned it as an idea, talks, development, anything.

As far as being concrete, that was never my statement as that pertains to being greenlit with a studio, platform and at least showrunner announced."
21955,2020-10-26 01:38:09,jhyc1e,"I get that, but by the same token, the profits for those movies are also going straight to Disney, not the Russos. If we're pushing the Russos as examples of financial success and business expertise, you kind of have to rely on the movies that they themselves produce, and thus would see any of the money from. Of which, only one has had the kind of box office success that Tyler Perry's movies always have."
21956,2020-10-25 21:40:20,jhyc1e,"
Those three movies weren't produced under their production company. That's Disney's."
21957,2020-10-25 21:45:54,jhyc1e,"Right, so I don't think you understand what being in development means. Productions do not start being in development UNTIL they've been greenlit by a studio, they're one and the same.


Just because some of the MCU cast and production talked about wanting to do it before F/WS and SW/V were announced doesn't actually mean, well, anything."
21958,2020-10-25 22:12:23,jhyc1e,"So the ultimate measure of success is being a producer? 

Harvey Weinstein more successful than Scorsese."
21959,2020-10-25 21:56:08,jhyc1e,"Production happens after development. Development includes looking for writers, ideas, showrunners, etc.

Production is when those things are already found.

There's 

\- development

\- then pre-production

\- shooting the actual thing

\- post production

The person you are referring to stated that they were announced together and that is correct, but he is responding to me, who is saying Loki and Hawkeye have been in development since 2016.

That is before they realized Disney+ would work."
21960,2020-10-25 22:16:27,jhyc1e,I'm saying comparing the success of Tyler Perry (who built his ship from ground up) to the Russos (who jumped on a moving ship and capitalized on it) shouldn't be compared.

21962,2020-10-25 22:09:55,jhyc1e,"Development does not include looking for those things, development is what happens after they are hired. Development is the showrunner(s) working with their writers to develop scripts.


Pre-production is scouting of locations, casting, etc, which I imagine at Marvel happens somewhat simultaneously to development tbh. 


So no, people talking about the concept of a show that looks possible in the near future is not 'in development'. 

[Here's the Wikipedia page for filmmaking if you're gonna keep trying to argue this nonsense, feel free to skip down to stages of production portion where it outlines the differences.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking)

In short, anything before you have a writing team attached to it is not even in development."

21966,2020-10-25 22:26:37,jhyc1e,I'm not the one posted a link that contradicts my point
21967,2020-10-25 22:33:22,jhyc1e,"Did you read it? I mean not just glance at the stages of development, but actually read what happens in each one?

Because initially initially, at the very start of this, you said it was in development because various production entities talked about how it would be a fun concept and they'd like to make it down the line. Then you said that coming up with an idea, hiring writers and attaching a showrunner were all aspects of a show in development. 

I said that all of those things are all done before development can even begin, especially the first half, because development is the actual script writing. Something that's known to literally anyone who has ever worked in the industry.

If you read the description for development, it says it's, shocker, when a screenplay is being developed.

So, can you clarify for me, how that in any way goes against my point?"
21968,2020-10-25 22:49:30,jhyc1e,"You know I read it. When Feige, who is from Marvel Studios, says Loki and Hawkeye are in development for **years before** anything is even brought up about WV and F/WS, **then my point still stands**. 

After Daredevil S2, when Avengers came out, he has constantly mentioned the word ""development"" when referencing Loki and Hawkeye. You can check those interviews for when he says it. **Not some random Youtuber or rumor site. Feige himself.**

The guy you're pleading for, tried to refute it with ""they were announced the same time"". None of that cancels out that there is no word on WV or F/WS before 2017. While there's been ""development"" used in reference to shows for Hawkeye and Loki since 2016

F/WS and WV are newer than Loki and Hawkeye. You proved my point even more by posting a link that list the stages almost exactly as I did it. Case closed"
21969,2020-10-25 23:31:40,jhyc1e,"Edit: I found another Hawkeye article that cites a 2016 interview where Renner says it'd be fun and cool and he's open to it, but it's ['Not up to me, though.'](https://ew.com/tv/2019/04/10/hawkeye-series-jeremy-renner-disney/)"

Googling 'Loki tv show announcement' yields nothing on the first page before 2018, adding Kevin's name yields nothing different, changing announcement to development yields nothing different. 


If you do all of those searches with Hawkeye instead of Loki, it yields nothing different with the exception of exactly one Kevin Feige talk ahead of the rest of their announcements, and it's only by a few months where he says a Hawkeye show is ['on Marvel's radar'](https://mcucosmic.com/2018/06/09/kevin-feige-gives-hints-at-the-future-of-the-mcu-post-avengers-4/).

22013,2020-10-25 20:53:17,jhy5pc,"Yes and no.  Depends on what you take as confirmation.  There's a lot of evidence pointing it at her (reports of casting grids, social media stuff, etc), but there's the pesky absence of incontrovertible proof in the form of a trade report really confirming it.

22016,2020-10-25 22:11:28,jhy5pc,"December 10 is where it will happen if it happens. Otherwise, they'll find somewhere else to talk about it, even if they have to host something online."
22017,2020-10-27 04:53:11,jhy5pc,"Idk why you got so many downvotes but WandaVision is supposed to release mid-late December so we’ll probably get an official date next month. It was rumored for a while that Falcon and the Winter Solider spoils Black Widow (not sure if that’s still true or they were only waiting to finish filming) but with so much uncertainty surrounding theater openings it’s kind of hard to give confirmed set dates without having to potentially move them again in the future if that is true so 2021 is all we have for now.

There’s been little bits of casting information released for Ms. Marvel, most recently Moon Night, and She Hulk (though IIRC there was confusion on that one) but it seems like they really just want to surprise us.

They don’t necessarily *have* to give any information  at all though."

Some other guys who I’m surprised are still on the board and may be taken here are Merrill and Mason Jones, Nate Hinton and Naji Marshall. All should have roles in the league (if not with a little less upside than hall)."

Yes, he does have a specific audience. But he seems to be fine with it. I can see how his core audience may react negatively if he began to, I don't know, write better storylines for black women, or dialogue that is more intelligent and less cliche. If what he is doing works for him I can't blame him for not wanting to alter it. But I think he could stand to do more of looking into the common things people say about his writing, instead of thinking people are just hating on him."
22056,2020-10-23 17:49:29,jgozs3,"Tough shit for him. Creators, particularly those like Perry, Chris Rock, 50 Cent, Chris Tucker, etc who are already incredibly wealthy don't get to complain about that.

In Perry's case, *so* many of his works jump face first into topics like domestic abuse, sexual assault, and a lot of issues that center around women he routinely refuses to give a voice in his writing room. It's more than valid for them to raise criticisms of his work.

His work is rife with colorism and it's more than valid for dark skinned black people to speak their minds.

> “Because if you’re complaining about my writing, you’re not the audience.""

This is easily the most telling. It's also annoying when people who are either black men use their blackness to dismiss black women or straight people use their blackness to dismiss lgbt black people. If you don't want to be criticized, don't make a cornerstone out of a large demographic that you routinely refuse to give a solid footing in despite having what amounts to your own empire.

It's also really a shame because other creators who take shots at Tyler Perry often miss the mark or are guilty of half the issues that make Tyler Perry such an issue to begin with themselves."

Which is completely understandable."
22059,2020-10-23 15:45:04,jgozs3,"Aw boo hoo poor billionaire. He’s talented at appealing to people not writing. I think those are two different things.

I believe a big part of his monetary success is the unethical ways he produces his content not the value of the content itself. He’s all about efficiency. So is McDonald’s. Is fast food the best food? No of course not but it does make a lot of money."
22060,2020-10-23 19:15:25,jgozs3,"His stance is confusing to me.  I understand the 'professional' critics arent his target audience - but I'm not sure he's clear on who his audience is either.

While he has the following of the 55yo+ churchgoing crowd w his Madea character and spinoffs I would genuinely like him to tell me who the other shows (Sistas, Brothas, The Oval, the one about the cult, etc) he writes are made for.

Edit: listened to a podcast several wks ago and the hosts discussed where some of the criticism stemmed from.  In summary: it's the fast/good/cheap triangle - you can have 2 but not all 3.  

To survive financially w Hollywood he went fast and cheap (ex. solo writing and filming entire seasons in 2wks - most shows film 1 episode a wk).  He just happened to find a niche (and now dying down) crowd that also hyped him up and told said the work was good.

So now constructive feedback from what could be an expansive audience is falling on deaf ears.  He'll be fine as a businessman but as a creator he's gonna end up going down in history like BET - groundbreaking at the time but unable to evolve."
22061,2020-10-23 20:00:44,jgozs3,"Lmao he will be ok. His writing sucks, I appreciate it for what it is which is nostalgia for me. I don't care if his feelings are hurt he's literally mega rich"
22062,2020-10-23 15:28:19,jgozs3,"I mean, I know who his audience is, and I am not that audience, so, I guess????

But how difficult would it be to be a good writer?"
22063,2020-10-23 22:42:38,jgozs3,"I get what he's saying. But the writing really does suck, not everybody saying that is hating on him. But if it's not broken why fix it."
22064,2020-10-24 15:05:19,jgozs3,"As an artist he has a right to make what he wants but if every critic says you're works are crap then it's crap. And that's fine because many writers will never win an Emmy/Golden Glob but they still entertain the masses.

The presence of sexism, colorism, and rushed writing is indefensible and the main problem."

&#x200B;

Even if you're *not* wealthy, you could be a first time author who just self-published a book on Amazon or you could be Stephen King releasing your 62nd traditionally published novel, it comes with the territory. You create any type of content, book, movie, song, etc., and release it to the public, then you are subject to criticism, and you're going to get it. It's on you to develop a thick skin and take everything person, as well to be able to recognize the difference between unfocused vitriol and legitimate contrustive critisicm.   


The comment about the intended audience is also somewhat valid. Like back to my other example, if you're reading a Stephen King book and complaining that it's too violent or scary, then you're probably not the audience for his books in the first place.   


Personally, just be seeing the various trailers, I've known that none of Perry's movies appeal to me, so I've never watched any, nor most of his TV shows. I once watched two episodes of House of Payne back to back because a friend of mine who is an actor had a guest-role on it, and they were two of the *least funny* sitcom episodes I've ever seen. I've never watched it again. I also watched the debut episode of The Have And The Have-Nots, just because I'm soap opera fan, and I actually thought it was *okay*, but just not good enough to entice me to continue to watch it after that."
22066,2020-10-23 16:50:22,jgozs3,What was Bao drama?! I thought it was really well done.
22067,2020-10-23 18:43:43,jgozs3,"That's true, but the intended audience comment is really underhanded in this context. To say that is to paint all criticism toward him as uniform and the result of people with no relation to him or his work.

If you're going to address criticism, you have to specifically bring up exactly what criticism you're talking about. In this context he could mean anything with ""criticism"" and it's the same issue that comes from creators who say ""just ignore the haters."" It decontextualizes the fact that people are critical with *why* they're critical and the latter is far more important.

To say that criticism comes from people who isn't his audience is also to say that black women, lgbt black people, and dark skinned black people are not his audience, so I consider it a very underhanded form of misdirection on his part."

22128,2020-12-11 05:49:35,kavu8a,Really excited about Iwaju and Tiana. I'm so glad that the Princess and the Frog is getting some love. I really enjoyed it! I hope it will be 2D. I just don't love how 3D animation looks and now even Ghibli is going in that direction.

Banks are in business utilizing different resources to make profit.   So I reiterate why can’t Disney do what they do?  It keeps people employed does it not?

22177,2020-12-11 14:23:20,kavu8a,"That's.... A lot. I can't say I'm thrilled about at least half of the projects announced and it *really* seems like they're scraping the bottom of the barrel for which Star Wars/Marvel characters they can spin-off, but at the very least it means I'll probably have to actually get a Disney+ subscription. On top of bringing out enough new originals that there's gotta be a Star Wars and Marvel episode of something every week for the whole year, their plans to bring more mature stuff to Disney+ means there might actually be a good back-catalogue of FX shows to catch up on. 

Overall the MCU stuff is standing out to me in just how consistently they're plucking directors and writers from seemingly nowhere. Star Wars keep announcing names I'm excited to hear are helming their shows/TV- Taika Waititi, Tony Gilroy, Patty Jenkins Leslye Headland, Justin Simien and Deborah Chow are all known quantities at this point and really exciting picks. Unless I'm missing something on the MCU front, there's not a single big name here, almost every announced writer/director has no more than a few episodes of a minor sitcom under their belts. Have established names like Taika Waititi, Ryan Coogler and James Gunn not given us possibly the best stuff in the MCU? Has The Mandalorian not shown that those big names can slot well into a TV format? It's obviously too early to say but as someone who's usually more excited by who's behind the camera than who's in front, it's giving me the impression that Marvel are seeking out writers/directors who will just do what they're told with no real style or flair. Picking someone like Jon Watts based on their experience with low-budget indie films that actually have some personality is a lot different than seemingly throwing darts at a list of random sitcom writers/directors."

Chang Latoya Muhammed Yakamoto is an outcast at school, but then she discovers that she can achieve everything she wants to in life!!!  And she meets friends along the way who teach her what's important in life!!

Here's another one:

Tayshaun Cheong Ahmed Singh feels like an outcast in his school.  But then he meets friends who inspire him to overcome all obstacles!!!  And they learn valuable lessons along the way!!!

Every idea Disney has here is garbage.  Nothing but SJW cringe in absolute every single one of these.  All trash.  Never have I been more thankful to have grown up in the era I did than now.  Holy fuckin shit, the sad part is that Disney will profit off all this SJW drivel.  Today's parents are so weak, they don't know how to raise kids right.

22252,2020-12-11 06:16:42,kavu8a,It's pretty crazy a guy can make wild shit for A24 and solid stuff for Disney as well. Takes a helluva balancing act to pull both off rather successfully.
22253,2020-12-11 08:01:34,kavu8a,Well I think something that should be stated is that Disney has given their plan for roughly the next four years. Every streaming service can make plans to compete since many don’t really unveil their plans that far out.
22254,2020-12-11 14:14:07,kavu8a,We don't that the sequel will be about a marriage fallout though do we ?
22255,2020-12-11 19:44:16,kavu8a,Anything else is treason.
22256,2020-12-12 16:55:50,kavu8a,"I feel like if he was, they would have said so."
22257,2020-12-11 08:51:35,kavu8a,They’ve been doing this since the 90’s - every movie back then had at least 3 sequels and an animated show. It’s just Disney+ is the new direct-to-video.
22258,2020-12-11 08:34:58,kavu8a,"thats what it feels like, but heres why youre wrong. this was an investor call, disney is basically telling investors what they plan on doing in the near future. as a result, this looks like a lot of shit, but remember, its not all coming out at once, so it wont feel like oversaturation since nobody is gonna be watching 10 star wars shows back to back"
22259,2020-12-11 06:44:36,kavu8a,"Thats what happens when you invest in a subscription service. You need compelling exclusives in order to suck in those sweet sweet monthly payments so Disney is scraping the bottom of the barrel for literally any IP they can milk.

Who knows what the quality is going to be like if they're going to rush all this to market."
22260,2020-12-11 10:28:03,kavu8a,"They are. The next 3 or 4 years is the climax of the streaming wars and this is Disney's main offensive. 


Once they have conclusively won or .ore realistically settled into a stalemate with Netflix and HBO Max,  they will likely settle down and release content more strategically paced. 


I think I'm starting to despise the word ""content"". It feels almost dystopic.



Oh well. I suppose ""looking on the bright side"" people will be getting their moneys worth with Disney+ for the next few years."
22261,2020-12-11 16:50:53,kavu8a,"That’s the whole goal of Disney though. Create an IP and build around it with movies, TV shows, theme park rides, and most importantly—toys. They need to make these shows around their IP to keep the name out there and to get people to buy the toys."
22262,2020-12-11 16:11:51,kavu8a,You should watch Cobra Kai (Karate Kid universe show) on Netflix. That's madness.
22263,2020-12-11 09:35:22,kavu8a,How was Elaine Benes

22266,2020-12-11 18:18:53,kavu8a,"I think the main problem for me is that Marvel does want you to watch everything. All the shows are tying into the movies, so instead of watching maybe 10 hours of movies like normal, you have to watch an additional 10 hours of disney+ to understand it. I’m not going to do that, so I probably won’t watch the movies either"
22267,2020-12-11 06:15:30,kavu8a,"As long as it uses *Star Wars* as a setting and not an excuse to cram in a lot of Jedi stuff, I'm cool with this. The known galaxy in *Star Wars* is vast and stuff that's only been teased in the countless films and shows opens up avenues for storytellers to explore. Hell, I'd be game for a whole series that's basically *The Wire* meets *Blade Runner* on the lowest levels on Corusant."
22268,2020-12-11 05:02:28,kavu8a,"If it's Mandalorian-quality, it won't feel like oversaturation at all."
22269,2020-12-11 05:02:17,kavu8a,Yeah I mean this is enough content for 10 lifetimes worth. My theory is that since they’ve axed theatrical releases they gone all in on streaming services.
22270,2020-12-11 06:47:18,kavu8a,Yeah clearly they did that with Marvel and now nobody wants to watch anything Marvel anymore. Oh wait.
22271,2020-12-11 05:59:24,kavu8a,Because 450+ books didn’t do that?
22272,2020-12-11 05:52:11,kavu8a,"Are we seriously already complaining about the new Star Wars content?

How much bitching is reddit capable of?"
22273,2020-12-11 06:12:44,kavu8a,Honestly rather this than a bunch of movies. Plus different parts of the timeline with different takes. Some are limited series. The Visions thing might be the most intriguing thing for me as I love stuff like Animatrix and Batman: Gotham Knight
22274,2020-12-11 05:09:27,kavu8a,"I was hoping they would make Mandalorian seasons longer. 8 episodes isn't enough. If these other shows are just as good, I'm happy!"
22275,2020-12-11 19:41:12,kavu8a,Compared to what?  Star Trek had a new episode every week for decades.  Marvel comic books have been coming out over and over for decades more.  Pop culture *is* more content.
22276,2020-12-12 03:22:20,kavu8a,I say go for it. The Star Wars universe is literally a gigantic space universe with trillions of stories to tell. It’s perfect for serial television shows.
22277,2020-12-11 14:11:46,kavu8a,Our own universe is over saturated with not-Star-Wars.

22286,2020-12-11 14:19:35,kavu8a,">  for the vast majority of these titles and shows we've been suffering from Marvel/Star Wars fatigue for years now.

Avengers: Endgame was the highest grossing movie of all time and we've had a more than a year since anything Marvel being released. It's wrong to say that the vast majority are experiencing Marvel fatigue. Star Wars is a bit different because of how poorly the sequel trilogy was handled but people seem to enjoy The Mandalorian."

22289,2020-12-11 17:31:14,kavu8a,"Different streaming services are focused on different genres. Disney knows their life blood is MCU/Star Wars, and animated shows/movies based on all the IP they have purchased.

That's in stark difference to Netflix that is dabbling in everything and anything trying to find something that sticks. Hell, they have Netflix sponsored Bollywood movies now, complete with song and dance."
22290,2020-12-11 16:03:59,kavu8a,Seems like a bunch are anthology style mini series. As long as they have a clear arc through like 10-12 episodes you can some really awesome stories that way.
22291,2020-12-11 18:27:07,kavu8a,"Personally I don’t like that the movies and shows are linked, because I don’t want to double how much marvel stuff I watch. So I probably won’t watch any marvel movies or shows at all, but thats just me and we’ll see if most audiences will continue to follow both"

But I get what you're saying and it reminds me of that movie Fanboys, which, for better or worse as a movie, has that story of just desperately wanting to live long enough to see that next thing, that big event or conclusion or whatever that the next generation will just never experience. I know Marvel/EU and everything have been going on for decades and that stories don't simply ""end"" in comics and novels and whatever, but it just makes me think that I'll never get an ending to die with that someone who saw Jedi in 1983 might have been able to. Morbid, but I take your point."

In the main timeline, Loki is still dead. Killed in IW.

The show takes place in the timeline where Tony and crew went back to New York 2012 get the Tesseract. It was knocked out of the suitcase and Loki picked it up and teleported away. The series will be following that Loki."

22338,2020-12-11 11:46:30,kavu8a,"Some people are upset because it looks like creative bankruptcy, i am not quite sure how you can say they'll explore the universe with these shows either tbh, it's really all things linked to already established names and ideas. That's not exploration, that's minimal risk and handing out a ton of fan service.  
The idea of quality is almost meaningless in such a construct, yeah ofc it will be up to a certain standard with disney's budget, but that's about it. Star Wars started as a milestone which pushed boundaries, i am not the biggest fan of the franchise, but even i have to at least give it props there, now it is no more than a brand name used to print as many dollars as possible."
22339,2020-12-11 11:35:23,kavu8a,">star wars has a established a massive universe, ofc things happen in it??

So far in Disney's Star Wars universe they've taken place in a short 20 years period (basically the middle of the Empire through just after) or it's the Sequels, which take place 30 years later but looks exactly like the OT era. Look at most of these shows. It's again mostly more Empire vs Rebels era stuff. They need to branch out and stop with just Empire stuff"
22340,2020-12-11 07:33:39,kavu8a,"Its like a carbon copy of them announting 15 or so star wars movies just as TFA was a smash hit, right after they got one successful TV series."

22348,2020-12-12 01:12:01,kavu8a,"That’s exactly what they’re doing, and I think it’s smart. I initially subscribed for three reasons:

1: Mandalorian

2: National Geographic

3: To share my account with my dad and step mom because I know they’d love it, but would never get their own account

The problems I have though is that Mandalorian is the only show that I really enjoy on there and their selection for NatGeo friggin sucks. I mean they have literally decades of material that they could put up, but there’s almost nothing on the NatGeo side. 

With The Mandalorian wrapping up I’ve been thinking about just canceling my subscription and just reactivating when something good comes along, but then I remember reason number three. I love getting texts from my dad saying “We just watched ~insert movie here~ last night. It really made me think about all the times I watched it with you and your brothers. Thanks again for sharing with us, son” and that’s why it’s worth whatever I pay each year."

22361,2020-12-11 23:05:47,kavu8a,"most of their movies can be seen in a vacuum except the obvious sequels. Like you could watch Dr Strange without watching any of the previous films. You can watch Ant-man without knowledge of any of the previous films. But you can't watch Captain America 3 without watching, at minimum, the previous captain america movies. Marvel has been pretty good about this. They're following the comic logic- people will follow their favorite character's arc, but don't necessarily have time to see every comic available. So as long as the person follows their favorite character, they're gonna be fine."
22362,2020-12-11 08:31:33,kavu8a,"yea just based off of the blurbs about what we know is in the works, theres a huge diversity of star wars content that theyre pursuing. theyve got sequel era shows like the mandalorian, theyve got prequel era shows like kenobi, theyve got movies set in the high republic era, a period of time nobody has seen yet, theyve got a war movie coming up with patty jenkins, etc"

Each IP is different, with strengths and weaknesses (also marvel's big success so far was mostly cinema driven in the space of live action mediums) which apply differently to the zeitgeist, etc.  
This is a lot of stuff, the mandalorian being a hit is great, but will it translate into people wanting to see a show about some guy from rogue one? Do people really wanna see a lando series? Idk, we'll have to see."

This basically keeps the theaters happy with Disney (they get something to show) and keeps the ""GIVE ME EVERYTHING IMMEDIATELY"" folks happy too. There's a choice rather than a forced one. Also they said it was gonna be one-offs for the most part- not every movie will have the option to do so, but they reserve the right to do it when they feel like it."

DS9 was a literal sequel to TNG, pulling two main characters straight from the *Enterprise-D*. They used their setting of a warfront to tell stories about what battle really does to a man, and how the veneer of civilization starts to deteriorate when faced with an existential threat. That's a story TNG could *never* tell because of the show's premise - a mission of exploration and discovery.

We don't know when Lando will be based, the only ones between the PT and OT announced are Cassian and Bad Batch, and bad batch looks to be exploring an era we've never seen before, the days afrer the rise of the empire. Then it sounds like Rogue Squaderon is based after the ST. I'd say thats doing a lot of work to expand the universe"

22415,2020-12-11 20:18:46,kavu8a,"I mean I'm with ya, I'll also be going into *any* of these shows with a healthy dose of skepticism, and there is no reason to feel loyalty or trust towards Disney. But reading the descriptions of these shows, especially The Acolyte and Visions, I think they're at least trying to make it LOOK like they're putting the effort in. They're introducing a new, completely unexplored era, they're trying out new styles and creative leads... And some of this other stuff, the Kenobi show, The Bad Batch, a live-action Ahsoka show, people have been begging them for this stuff for ages, we all expected these announcements. Plus it looks like Dave Filoni is really stepping up, who was the voice of reason in the Star Wars universe and history even back under Lucas.

Like yeah, obviously this is all profit-motivated, and if they can just pull all of this out of their ass in a year then the more moral move would have been to chuck that same money at 500 young, brilliant sci-fi writers desperate to make their mark with their own original series. But was anybody expecting that?

Also, I'm learning that I really, really like big collaborative worldbuilding projects. Maybe it's a kid's way of thinking, but I like lightsabers and The Force and Jedi, and I want to see lots of stories from that world. I like the lore, I like seeing new takes on the stuff I grew up with. It's like a big DnD game where all the players are actors and Filoni is the DM."
22416,2020-12-11 18:01:44,kavu8a,"The Acolyte is sitting right there. Mark my words, if it becomes the biggest of the shows they’ll double down on fresh Star Wars settings. On the other hand, if its Andor... More Rebels vs Empire."

This doesn't have much to do with anything but most marriages don't really end in divorce.

Of course, that's not to say these marriages are all still happy.

22438,2020-12-11 16:09:19,kavu8a,"I was thinking that at first, but then I realized the Mandalorian is only like 4 hours per season, so casual fans could probably get caught up in one or two weekends a year if they feel the need to watch everything. I grew up watching the same 6 VHS tapes over and over so I'm certainly not complaining."

Also... you can only take in so much of this until it becomes over saturated and boring. I think I’ve hit that point with the Marvel content.

Most of these series are literally in the era after the Prequels to a little after the Empire. They will be drenched in OT iconography. Mandalorian is supposed to be 5 years after the Empire. There has been more Empire iconography than anything else in the show. And the sequel era literally just OT iconography.

22475,2020-12-11 16:43:57,kavu8a,"Well yes because it is true. It was the star wars fandom which harassed actors and actresses because they didn't like a fictional character, it was them who couldn't deal with brie larson being a little critical of certain hollywood standards, it was them who cried like little babies when they didn't like a film and wanted to destroy the lifes of people involved. All of that is more edgelord mentality than being aware that a lot of entertainment is incredibly mediocre while producing more and more money with it, you don't need to be a reddit warrior to see it, a lot of people point this out, including legendary directors and artists."
22476,2020-12-11 06:10:47,kavu8a,And my Axe!
22477,2020-12-11 08:19:04,kavu8a,"They speak only of Star Wars there. Otherwise, they got plenty of other things. In fact, I don't think they really decreased their number of theatrical films while upping massively the production for Disney+ original content. There will still be 3 MCU movies a year for example.

Btw, it is weird how they didn't even mention Avatar 2 and 3 in that presentation."
22478,2020-12-11 15:08:01,kavu8a,"Well, yes and no. They were all canon to each other, but George certainly didn’t consider them part of his story. 

Not saying that as a bad thing about the EU - just how it was."
22479,2020-12-11 16:10:27,kavu8a,I am Groot
22480,2020-12-12 11:45:38,kavu8a,">Those are bitch, they will be redditing

I'm not sure I understand what we are playing..."
22481,2020-12-11 18:04:58,kavu8a,Obviously the exception among their output.
22482,2020-12-11 20:24:38,kavu8a,Hmmm... that's fair. I didn't even think about the two animated series. (which reminds me that I need to check out Rebels)
22483,2020-12-12 02:18:11,kavu8a,Do you like Doctor Strange because the Sorcerer Supreme is kind of like a Grand Wizard?
22484,2020-12-11 22:55:49,kavu8a,Harassing actors is not exclusive to the Marvel and Star Wars fandoms.
22485,2020-12-11 09:21:59,kavu8a,Avatar is still  theatrical vehicle.  Apparently James Cameron even has new projectors for theaters where they'll actually project in 3D so you don't even need glasses.
22486,2020-12-12 02:52:55,kavu8a,Never seen it
22487,2020-12-11 23:12:10,kavu8a,"Sure, i also shouldn't have used the qualifier ""most"", but i think it is fairly accurate to say that these big, nerdy spheres have a good amount of edgelords in them, though maybe edgelord might not be the perfect descriptor for what i have in mind.  
  
Being aware how big corporations work and where the general trend lies when it comes to the entertainment industry, well i don't think that's quite as out there tbh. As i said, big artists oftentimes share these sentiments because, well, it's true. (though tbf, the comment of the guy wasn't great, but it's in a reasonable thread and only added to that tbh)"
22488,2020-12-11 09:39:00,kavu8a,Yeah of course but they still spoke of plenty of theatrical content in that show. All the MCU movies are still theatrical only and coming to Disney+ only months later (like presumably Avatar sequels)
22489,2020-12-11 09:53:40,kavu8a,"I don't know the background of the event, but I'm assuming it was strictly related to Disney+ content.  All the stuff listed above are all Disney+ streaming content."
22490,2020-12-11 14:15:33,kavu8a,It wasn't strictly disney+ ( the event )
22491,2020-12-11 21:22:54,kavu8a,Gotcha.
22492,2020-12-11 07:01:10,kavrwz,"So, I guess their goal today was to take everyone who said D+ had no original content besides The Mandalorian, and pretty much punch them in the face repeatedly."
22493,2020-12-11 05:52:40,kavrwz,Hooch is crazy
22494,2020-12-11 04:58:35,kavrwz,"Nothing on any of the ""old"" Netflix series has me sad...  Nice write up, though."

22498,2020-12-11 05:05:30,kavrwz,Super stoked on most of this. I’m especially looking forward to the Nat geo content. Can you imagine if Disney+ dropped with half of these titles? Game changer
22499,2020-12-11 13:06:41,kavrwz,"Based on the release timelines of those shows, it looks like their strategy is: 

Zeitgeist show for 6 weeks -> 1 week of cool down —> couple weeks of hype up -> next Zeitgeist show -> Repeat"
22500,2020-12-11 07:25:29,kavrwz,They're really going all out with the High Republic.
22501,2020-12-11 05:50:31,kavrwz,did She Hulk get a trailer or anything?
22502,2020-12-11 10:15:17,kavrwz,that's a lot of content
22503,2020-12-11 19:04:19,kavrwz,"So strange to realize Ice Age is owned by Disney now. 

Also I’m sort of unexpectedly excited about the continuation of Mighty Ducks!"
22504,2020-12-11 13:13:06,kavrwz,A Turner and Hooch reboot yyyeeeeessss!!! I've been a fan (we call ourselves Hoochers) for years and am flipping out right now!!!!
22505,2020-12-11 13:29:08,kavrwz,Missing rogue squadron on Star Wars
22506,2020-12-11 13:46:42,kavrwz,Hocus Pocus 2. What.

Just going to ignore the Little Mermaid and Tangled series apparently."

22510,2020-12-11 13:10:21,kavrwz,I have only read a hand full of moon knight comics but from what I have heard and read making a PG moon knight show is not going to go over well with fans.
22511,2020-12-11 16:20:59,kavrwz,Any specific dates to go with this?
22512,2020-12-11 19:53:29,kavrwz,You forgot the multiple tongue in cheek references to Matt Murdock.  Charlie Cox's Daredevil is officially part of the MCU now.  Hes apparently in She Hulk and Spider-Man 3.
22513,2020-12-12 01:10:08,kavrwz,"Damn, the Ducks end up becoming what they rebelled against..."
22514,2020-12-11 05:18:44,kavrwz,"As a bi dude I'm still waiting for literally anything big that features a non-straight dude. In film they ignored it almost completely out of fear of gay-hating countries banning it and them losing money (like China). 

Really hoping for something to come through, maybe with x-men back in the fold Iceman could get something"
22515,2020-12-11 08:21:15,kavrwz,So is Ahsoka taking the place of the Rebels spinoff? Because thats what I was most excited for
22516,2020-12-11 16:46:16,kavrwz,Disney is milking Star Wars and Marvel for everything dollar they can squeeze. There are way too many reboots and remakes. They need originally sourced content that has no reliance on existing IP. How about some original NON-Marvel/Star Wars scripted content? I think the Mandalorian is a cute show but I want to see ORIGINAL content for once. This slate of shows are not enough to keep all of their subscribers satisfied.
22517,2020-12-11 17:11:28,kavrwz,Seems like Star Wars's future is on TV.
22518,2020-12-11 18:02:53,kavrwz,Is it weird that I'm most excited for the Josh Peck version of Turner and Hooch?
22519,2020-12-11 20:26:03,kavrwz,"Looks like they're updating Microcosmos with A Real Bug's Life, that should be cool as fuck."
22520,2020-12-11 21:23:43,kavrwz,">The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers

>Lauren Graham (Gilmore Girls, Parenthood) and Emilio Estevez (reprising his role from the original feature films) star in the next chapter of the hit Mighty Ducks franchise, premiering in early 2021. In present day Minnesota, the Mighty Ducks have evolved from scrappy underdogs to an ultra-competitive, powerhouse youth hockey team. After 12-year-old Evan is unceremoniously cut from the Ducks, he and his mom Alex set out to build their own ragtag team of misfits to challenge the cutthroat, win-at-all-costs culture of competitive youth sports.

I hope Disney has been paying attn to Cobra Kai and takes all the good from it and applies it to the Ducks!!!"
22521,2020-12-12 04:36:12,kavrwz,"Man, Tony Stark cannot keep control of his tech, can he? Well, I guess he's dead, so that makes sense."
22522,2020-12-21 17:14:28,kavrwz,The one thing I want from Marvel is an OG Nick Fury and the Howling Commandos show.
22523,2021-02-19 11:23:43,kavrwz,They forgot Shadow Hunters.
22524,2020-12-11 15:19:07,kavrwz,I just want to have the spin off Thrawn and Ezra travels in space show.
22525,2020-12-11 10:48:48,kavrwz,so much content that post alone made me vomit .
22526,2020-12-11 05:32:35,kavrwz,"Hey, bozo, why didn't you mention It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia?

Great list, otherwise."
22527,2020-12-11 09:03:23,kavrwz,Disney+ launch was more like beta test to ensure their decision of allocating such resources to the platform
22528,2020-12-12 15:49:44,kavrwz,"The criticism was regarding lack of original screenplays, too. It's still true in that aspect."
22529,2020-12-11 11:00:18,kavrwz,"It's still lacks diversity, it's still marvel, star wars and Pixar animated pg-13 movies, still no new new IPs."

22533,2020-12-11 05:02:38,kavrwz,"Just hints at Daredevil, from Sony in Spider-Man 3 and at the reveal here today for She-Hulk."
22534,2020-12-11 14:47:15,kavrwz,"Yeah sounds like the Multiverse in SM3 will pull in Daredevil and Kingpin. Which could be great.

Daredevil was hinted at strongly for SheHulk, and there have been rumors that DNofrio has campaigned hard and they’ve taken him seriously as maybe using his character to put together the Sinister Six."
22535,2020-12-11 17:37:50,kavrwz,"There's a big hint in Hawkeye. Maya Lopez is a definitively Daredevil character (Echo, a deaf woman who can see something once and imitate it originally hired by Kingpin to take out Daredevil and eventually befriending him). She also wore the Ronin outfit for awhile that Hawkeye wore in Endgame after his family vanished (New Avengers comics).

Edit: why am I being downvoted for this?"
22536,2020-12-11 20:43:43,kavrwz,Thanks man you're awesome

22538,2020-12-11 08:38:21,kavrwz,Not enough 🚀🚀🚀
22539,2020-12-11 20:53:16,kavrwz,And Swiss Family Robinson.
22540,2020-12-11 14:41:22,kavrwz,It’s pretty genius
22541,2020-12-11 14:51:57,kavrwz,Super into the Acolyte as I’d really like to see what the Sith/dark side users were up to during this time period
22542,2020-12-11 06:39:39,kavrwz,"No, but they confirmed Tatiana Maslany."
22543,2020-12-11 16:21:20,kavrwz,Tim Roth will be back as Abomination and Mark Ruffalo.
22544,2020-12-12 02:56:32,kavrwz,Its a rather deceptive line if your not in the know.  WDAS is the movie studio. Disney Television Animation is the studio that typically handles the TV side (they were the ones that made the Tangled series).
22545,2020-12-11 13:35:16,kavrwz,That's not necessarily a bad thing tbh. It's how they execute it that matters. GOTG was kinda considered a bottom of the barrel IP for marvel before they made it and it turned out well.
22546,2020-12-11 23:07:07,kavrwz,"There’s like 70 announced shows here and less than 10 are actual original ideas. Really disappointing *in my opinion*.

I get people like Star Wars and stuff, but it seems extreme to me."
22547,2020-12-11 19:28:47,kavrwz,"I think it could be done. For me at least the fun part is the mind-bendy unreliable narrator stuff and not the graphic violence. Although there is something to be said for when other characters meet Moon Knight and are like, ""oh this guy is *crazy* crazy and not just *Batman* crazy."""
22548,2020-12-11 06:00:15,kavrwz,"This didn’t mention any of the Marvel movies since it’s still not certain whether they’ll be released in theaters first or on Disney+ at the same time, but The Eternals is set to have their first openly gay main character whenever that’s released.

If you haven’t watched the Disney+ short film Out, you absolutely should."
22549,2020-12-11 05:55:44,kavrwz,"Young Avengers is just over the horizon, and that comes with the most prominent gay couple in marvel. Still a few years out though."
22550,2020-12-11 15:23:22,kavrwz,Not sure if it is 100% confirmed but I remember seeing somewhere that Valkyrie is looking for a wife in the next Thor movie.
22551,2020-12-11 12:51:46,kavrwz,"As a fellow homo, I'm sorry you're getting downvoted, but that's r/television for you. I've learned not to bring up representation issues on this sub anymore."
22552,2020-12-11 14:52:52,kavrwz,"I would bet it will be in a team, or they will reveal the character is gay in a sequel...that way people in China will already be invested.  Because you’re right....they want that China money badly. 


Wouldn’t it be a kick in the nuts to China if the wait until like Shang Chi 3 and reveal he was gay the whole time! Lmao. That could literally start a war!!"
22553,2020-12-21 17:11:41,kavrwz,I really don't like the sound of this. The whole point of the Ducks is that they are scrappy underdogs. Having them become what they played against feels kind of weird. And it's obviously gonna end with both Ducks teams playing against each other. It just sounds weird to me.

It's so formulaic it isn't appealing.

Will smith movie,
Cars tv show, 
SW, SW, SW, SW, SW
Marvel movies or shows of all side movie characters, because why not saturate the market with bland superheros"
22564,2020-12-11 19:37:28,kavrwz,"Yeah. Did anyone really expect Disney to do something genuinely new? Aside from Pixar, which still has very niche content, I can't remember the last time Disney did an actually new story. 

It's one of the reasons this obsession people on here have with D+ ""killing"" Netflix is so silly."

22572,2020-12-12 02:30:02,kavrwz,Duh.  If you want Disney's adult content you mosey over to Hulu.  If you've been looking at the end of the year critics' lists you'll have noticed Disney is beating Netflix and Warnerbrothers decisively when it comes to critical acclaim.
22573,2020-12-12 00:55:57,kavrwz,Disney doesn’t give a fuck about that. They care about commercial success of which they aren’t matched.

I think the Series will be used to set up bigger events in the movies.  Almost like a Rogue One to Star Wars.  

That way people who want more background will have it, and yet you don’t HAVE to have seen it to follow the movies.  

Also Ironheart, Kate Bishop, Ms Marvel and I’m betting a Young Loki will get set up for a Secret Avengers movie."

We’ll most likely see Justin Hammer return and the intro of some other big Iron Man villains like Crimson Dynamo.

I wouldn’t call it bottom of the barrel. The only difference is that War Machine will he finally getting the spotlight rather than Iron Man"

22583,2020-12-10 20:18:40,kai7g2,"Yeah so lets see:

An old team got one year older

No addition in free agency

Didn't improve by trades

Lost their starter and 1C for months


Fans see them in the wcf, scf... and also in 5 years they see them as a contender. Please. With this aging roster and no prospects, this is a lottery team in 2 years imo. This year they can make the playoffs but i just don't see a miracle like the one in the summer happening again."

22591,2020-12-23 10:45:45,kai7g2,"Salty maybe, but objective also. Every single fact above is true. Yet -12, truth hurts i guess. And also this is not dallas-specific: Take away any teams no1 goalie and 1c, and they will suck. Yet people believe that they can go on a run with Hintz,Faksa, and plug1,plug2 in the middle."
22592,2020-12-11 16:21:34,kai7g2,"It isn't those guys that give me pause. Obviously through the course of a season, especially a shortened season, you lose people to injury and poor play. What concerns me is what I believe will be a bit of a quagmire at the bottom of the forward depth chart.

That and not having Bishop for the majority of the season."
22593,2020-12-10 20:50:22,kai7g2,Yeah but wheres that extra cap going to go when they come back?

22888,2020-12-29 22:20:24,kmo7u2,"rip blinding lights it was a good run, really thought it would last until 2021 though.        
wonder if any songs off WLR will chart next week (my guess is not, mayyybe the song with cudi).    
also feel like that meg/dababy song is gonna be a slow climber but eventually reach top 30"
22889,2020-12-29 23:45:27,kmo7u2,I kinda like how the xmss songs takeover the charts. It cleans the sheet for the new year.
22890,2020-12-29 22:17:36,kmo7u2,"It'll be interesting to see how the charts recover next week when all the Christmas songs drop off. I'm not sure how much of WLR will chart, the top song has only got 3 mil plays on Spotify as of today."
22891,2020-12-30 00:36:18,kmo7u2,"First Christmas without a girlfriend in 4 years . Both our families aren’t Christian so we don’t celebrate it with them but when we were together we would celebrate like in a secular American relationshipy way. Anyways what I’m saying, WLR is the Christmas album I needed this year"
22892,2020-12-30 04:53:52,kmo7u2,"Almost 40 songs on the top 100 are Christmas. They have to do something about ""seasonal"" music. Its holding back alot of artists from the achievement of charting. Artists are going to quit dropping music in December so they don't have to compete with Christmas music"
22893,2020-12-30 02:22:54,kmo7u2,they should really do something about the christmas songs on the charts in this new streaming era. when Mariah Carey went number 1 last year on a 25 year old song it was kinda cute but having the whole top 10 being dominated by christmas songs is tiring
22894,2020-12-30 00:26:22,kmo7u2,I don’t think this is the week of January 02 right?
22895,2020-12-30 05:26:09,kmo7u2,The fact that Christmas in Hollis can't get on this list during Christmas time infuriates me. Let's get some good Christmas music on this list
22896,2020-12-30 00:19:50,kmo7u2,Last year was the start
22897,2020-12-30 02:04:20,kmo7u2,People’s obsession with Christmas music is something I’ll never understand. Is it a religious/Christian thing?
22898,2020-12-29 23:29:44,kmo7u2,"If WLR sells ~125k I feel like a couple of songs will chart, especially since less people are gonna listen to Christmas songs after Dec 25th"
22899,2020-12-30 00:45:57,kmo7u2,"the kanye track would have been a top 5 debut on spotify without christmas songs, i think itll make it"

22902,2020-12-29 23:52:30,kmo7u2,"For the marketing that album got, the first week sale is gonna flop"
22903,2020-12-30 01:18:43,kmo7u2,"Yeah I'm not entirely sure it can beat out taylor swifts album for number 1 anymore tbh, which is sad because if kid cudi was on it that would have been a top 10 hit easily with the album going number 1 even though it was originally big 1.5 years ago, a fan post of the song on youtube uploaded recently as they all get taken down is getting more views than some songs on wlr"
22904,2020-12-30 06:06:56,kmo7u2,2016-2018 i had a gf every christmas! then 2019 and now 2020 i’ve been single. as much as i like a relationship i’ve appreciated my time single. hope you can too man
22905,2020-12-30 05:20:21,kmo7u2,I mean what can they do. AIWFC had 17 million streams in one day on Spotify a couple of days ago. If that’s not deserving of number 1 I don’t know what is.
22906,2020-12-30 13:46:01,kmo7u2,it is. charts are counted week ahead
22907,2020-12-30 02:18:19,kmo7u2,Not necessarily. People just associate it with the holidays. A lot of people are definitely just letting Spotify playlists run the music
22908,2020-12-30 03:07:01,kmo7u2,"Nah man, for me it's just a warm cozy vibe to have Christmas music playing when it's cold outside and I'm at work. Perfect background music for this time of year."
22909,2020-12-30 17:55:23,kmo7u2,"It’s not really a religious thing, christmas is very secularized in America."
22910,2020-12-30 17:12:58,kmo7u2,Christmastime gives many people a feeling that I would say is comparable to nostalgia. Listening to the music helps people get into that feeling. Plus tradition
22911,2020-12-30 07:54:27,kmo7u2,I think Slayer doing better than the kanye song
22912,2020-12-30 06:05:35,kmo7u2,what marketing? it’s literally almost driven by hype generated by carti fans and blogs. no real singles prior to it. it’s just carti posting shit
22913,2020-12-30 00:22:46,kmo7u2,Well I mean the album was terrible
22914,2020-12-30 06:11:10,kmo7u2,Yeah I’m equal parts nervous and excited about my single life. It’s just the uncertainty that gets to me sometimes although I’m sure I’ll be fine. Thanks bro
22915,2020-12-30 02:30:12,kmo7u2,Ah ok makes sense
22916,2020-12-30 16:24:34,kmo7u2,also don't underestimate how many people are using this for their businesses
22917,2020-12-30 20:14:42,kmo7u2,"True shit, can't remember the last time I heard someone regard Christmas celebrations in a religious light"
22918,2020-12-30 09:58:07,kmo7u2,"Yeah, Slay3r has the most streams."
22919,2020-12-30 03:37:48,kmo7u2,"it's good, remove a couple songs and it's a 8/10 at least"
22920,2020-12-30 06:11:48,kmo7u2,no worries man. you got this!
22921,2020-12-31 01:06:28,kmo7u2,like there's basically another holiday on top of it with Santa and presents that even non-Christians practice and tell their kids abt
22922,2020-12-30 04:48:13,kmo7u2,The beginning sucks and nobody is going to listen to the rest of the album if they get a bad first impression.
22923,2020-12-30 04:11:42,kmo7u2,Not even close it’s a 4 at best lmao
22924,2020-12-30 05:03:05,kmo7u2,"i completely understand but that's why I'm saying this, ppl listened to the first half and turned it off"
22925,2020-12-30 10:08:57,kmo7u2,Best part of the album is beginning and Album is great
22926,2020-12-30 05:03:59,kmo7u2,idk how you can listen to the second half and think most of those songs arent good (assuming youre a carti fan)

22958,2020-12-27 14:26:30,kkts53,I saw the promotional pics for Coming To America 2 and was like “Eddie and Arsenio haven’t aged a day since the first one” but on this picture Eddie looks fatter than Martin Lawrence in Bad Boys 3.
22959,2020-12-27 17:59:06,kkts53,Anybody else seeing the illusion of the Martin Lawrence man bun
22960,2020-12-27 08:09:18,kkts53,Arsenio took the picture
22961,2020-12-27 13:30:53,kkts53,Tyler Parry's movies are utter shits tho.
22962,2020-12-27 13:14:42,kkts53,"Great picture. Tyler Perry sucks at making movies, I know people like him so I’ll take the downvoted. I was dumbfounded how he kept making those movies where he’s a bitter mean grandma  or older lady. There was no deeper level or subtlety to the writing, just being really loud and insulting seemed to be the heart of the humor. I think there’s like 40 of them."

22965,2020-12-27 10:52:09,kkts53,Martin Lawrence looks like he's got the biggest bun up there.
22966,2020-12-27 12:55:23,kkts53,Wesley Snipes looks rough.  He must have just gotten out of bed in his trailer.
22967,2020-12-27 16:09:41,kkts53,Eddie looks like someone wearing an Eddie Murphy mask. But maybe I’m just thinking that because there’s at least two movies where someone wears an Eddie Murphy mask.
22968,2020-12-27 18:05:03,kkts53,Lotta net worth in this picture.
22969,2020-12-27 18:36:29,kkts53,Bad boys 3 came out almost 2 years ago? Whats taking coming to America so long then?
22970,2020-12-27 22:46:38,kkts53,SO MANY memories of these actors and the movies they stared in.  This is my JAM!
22971,2020-12-29 22:17:46,kkts53,How come Will Smith looks young again? Creepy. Is it hair dye?
22972,2021-03-09 02:26:48,kkts53,Is will smith packing heat. Look at that ding ding!
22973,2020-12-27 11:10:13,kkts53,Two movies no one asked for being filmed at the same time? What a coincidence.
22974,2020-12-27 05:50:07,kkts53,Looking forward to Coming to America 2. Bad Boys 3? It’s like Fast & Furious or Pirates of the Caribbean... Just fuckin stop.
22975,2020-12-27 10:48:27,kkts53,Always one who looks at the camera everyone else is not 🤣🤣🤣
22976,2020-12-27 11:06:00,kkts53,I’m overcome with nostalgia. How bittersweet.
22977,2020-12-27 14:09:29,kkts53,I’m glad Leslie Jones wasn’t there to ruin the picture

22979,2020-12-27 13:17:51,kkts53,Everybody liked that.
22980,2020-12-27 15:05:11,kkts53,Yooo this is dope!! These movies are gonna fucking blow

22984,2020-12-27 05:39:55,kkts53,"He's a billionaire ffs.  And I don't mean that in a rude way or anything.  I basically have only heard his name, seen nothing he's done or ever seen him on tv anywhere yet reading his wiki he's done a ton.  Alot of mediocre stuff it seems but then he buys an air force base and creates a studio and I guess is raking it in.  Pretty crazy."
22985,2020-12-27 09:30:42,kkts53,He was working valet that day
22986,2020-12-27 11:16:01,kkts53,Dude looks like Wesley Snipes here lol
22987,2020-12-27 12:32:53,kkts53,He's the one taking the picture duh although it's kind of rude that they all are looking away from the camera.
22988,2020-12-27 18:37:56,kkts53,HOO!!!! HOO!!!! HOO!!!! HOO!!!! HOO!!!! HOO!!!! HOO!!!! HOO!!!!

22991,2020-12-29 21:15:47,kkts53,Idk that girl in the bottom right still looks like a child

23000,2020-12-27 10:08:39,kkts53,No. Bad Boys 3 was released Jan 2020 before Covid. They were probably finishing as Coming To America 2 was starting.

23004,2020-12-27 14:47:57,kkts53,Are you trying to say that no-name actors will be miserable getting their picture taken with Will Smith and Eddie Murphy?  I feel like the opposite would be true.
23005,2020-12-28 04:14:33,kkts53,"When Eddie hosted SNL last year, he definitely had a potbelly. Maybe that was when he put on weight for *Dolemite Is My Name*"
23006,2020-12-27 22:03:20,kkts53,The only thing Tyler Perry has to do with these movies is they used his Soundstages.
23007,2020-12-27 16:35:24,kkts53,"Not true. Yeah, it’s a lot of gross humor but most  of his films also touch on relationship and familial issues."
23008,2020-12-27 16:44:54,kkts53,There are more Tyler Perry movies than the Madea series.
23009,2020-12-27 16:35:05,kkts53,"It's pandering to the audience in a negative way. It's ""relatable"" but to outsiders it's ghetto"
23010,2020-12-27 19:30:50,kkts53,Bad Boys 3 is the top box office winner for 2020. It came out 11 months ago.
23011,2020-12-27 06:05:52,kkts53,"The Fast & Furious franchise is currently at 10 movies with 3 others in production.

Pirates of the Caribbean only has 5.

Bad Boys 3 already released in January of this year.

Maybe don't day drink so much."

23014,2020-12-27 06:01:17,kkts53,"Yeah, like maybe Tyler Perry hasn't made the best movies, but he sure is employing a lot of folks, and creating a lot of good in the black community. Mad respect for someone who made it to the top and then helped others have the same opportunities."
23015,2020-12-27 06:28:02,kkts53,Did you see Star Trek (2009 I think was the year?) or Gone Girl? He had bit parts in both of those. I found him very charismatic in Gone Girl.
23016,2020-12-27 12:18:09,kkts53,"He spent 15 years putting on stage shows and roping in the black church audience, who compliantly joined his mailing list and buy his products because he’s a good church boy. 

On his end of it, he never rewrites his films. The first draft is what his actors and crew crank out. It’s really fascinating how he leveraged a loyal activist audience into allowing a minimum-viable-product, pile-high-sell-cheap conveyer belt business model. In some ways he represents the worst of filmmaking and in other ways he represents the best in film business.

Just don’t try to unionise on his backlot."
23017,2020-12-27 11:14:14,kkts53,"His movies are utter shit, but he’s a billionaire"

23021,2020-12-27 16:29:53,kkts53,Maybe /r/woosh but Arsenio has a funny set about this in his Netflix special.
23022,2020-12-27 12:43:10,kkts53,Implying Tommy Lee Jones isn't the star of Men in Black.
23023,2020-12-27 15:47:50,kkts53,I saw a video a while back showing how Will Smith dominates conversations by just never stopping mid-sentence.
23024,2020-12-27 22:25:32,kkts53,Will Smith didn’t take the role of Django in Django Unchained because he thought Dr. Shultz was the real main character.

23029,2020-12-27 12:28:34,kkts53,"What you’re seeing in the post title is certainly incorrect comma usage, not the oxford comma."
23030,2020-12-27 08:55:38,kkts53,"**[Serial comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial comma)**

In English language punctuation, a serial comma, or series comma (also called an Oxford comma or Harvard comma), is a comma placed immediately after the penultimate term (i.e. before the coordinating conjunction [usually and or or]) in a series of three or more terms. For example, a list of three countries might be punctuated either as ""France, Italy and Spain"" (without the serial comma) or ""France, Italy, and Spain"" (with the serial comma).Opinions among writers and editors differ on whether to use the serial comma, and usage also differs somewhat between regional varieties of English. British English allows constructions with or without this comma, while in American English it is common and sometimes even considered mandatory to use the comma.

When you hear about the movie industry growing and growing in GA it’s bc of tax breaks and TPS.  

The dude is killing it."
23033,2020-12-27 09:31:48,kkts53,Same. I want to see more of him in those types of roles.
23034,2020-12-27 18:02:53,kkts53,Yeah he was suave as hell in Gone Girl
23035,2020-12-27 21:50:32,kkts53,"Funny thing is Tyler Perry himself said he would have turned down the role if he'd knew who David Fincher was, for some reason."
23036,2020-12-27 22:20:30,kkts53,I really enjoyed him in Gone Girl! I wish he would do more parts like that.
23037,2020-12-27 12:59:56,kkts53,Activist? How?
23038,2020-12-27 12:06:43,kkts53,Catering to the lowest common denominator pays off.

23043,2020-12-27 19:07:28,kkts53,Care to elaborate?

23047,2020-12-27 21:57:48,kkts53,Most of Marvel is out at Pinewood Atlanta ( now Trilith) but it is a nice studio
23048,2020-12-27 22:23:49,kkts53,"You made me curious, so I did some research.

He didn’t know who David Fincher (a very famous director who has made very famous movies) was, and he didn’t know Gone Girl (extremely popular book), and he would rather take parts in more indie movies. 

Essentially, he just likes to keep a low profile."
23049,2021-02-26 16:57:50,kkts53,It's because he's stupid.
23050,2020-12-27 13:01:04,kkts53,Basically he got black church women to recruit other black church women onto his mailing list.
23051,2020-12-27 17:03:02,kkts53,"His big money is from his studio, not his shitty movies.  although they paid for that studio do yeah maybe. 

He has larger sound stages than most Hollywood studios.  They shoot all kinds of big budget movies there (almost all marvel movies)."
23052,2020-12-27 12:12:17,kkts53,A businessman through and through
23053,2020-12-27 17:57:07,kkts53,Listen madea movies are dumb but I’m a sucker for a good dumb movie!
23054,2020-12-27 14:13:04,kkts53,The lowest common denominator? I believe that’s called racism?
23055,2020-12-27 16:26:15,kkts53,Plus Smith got to do a tie-in music video.  He got plenty of exposure off of that project.

23058,2020-12-27 22:08:20,kkts53,"May have flipped.  I did some work there a while back and they were finishing black panther and listed off several others.  Maybe changed, maybe both, but I’m certain they have done several at TPS."

edit: also, lauren lapkus and nicole byer have a podcast called newcomers. First season they did star wars. 2nd was lord of the rings. for the 3rd they are thinking of doing tyler perry movies."

Well I guess he is Jewish so the link could be made by someone looking for it."

Also, I'm glad Victoria also talked about how sweet Nastasia is. Also glad she spoke about what a bitch Kristin really was lol. It also seems like Laura is pretty much a bitch too.

&#x200B;

All in all, a great interview."
23063,2020-12-26 19:48:18,kkoefl,Her interview had me feeling all sorts of emotions. I loved it! I want to be Victoria’s friend. 😭

23065,2020-12-26 23:44:40,kkoefl,Thanks for the summary!!! I have only watched this cycle once and Victoria was one of the very few bright spots for me. I loved her method modeling and she turned out some great photos.
23066,2020-12-26 20:29:43,kkoefl,I loved every second of it. She's a very good narrator and I'm glad she's doing well.

also cudi's top 2 charting tracks being non-features is cool"

Cudi debuted a lot more than I thought he would on the top 100."

23087,2020-12-24 00:02:42,kj0tlu,Look at the difference in pure sales between the pop and hip hop albums. No wonder. Pop fans buy copies like their life depends on it and we just bump it and if we ride with it we bump it more and if we REALLY love it only then we'll buy a full copy and if we don't feel it after the first listen we never stream it again lmao
23088,2020-12-24 16:36:21,kj0tlu,Have y'all istened to the Taylor Swift tape? How is it

23090,2020-12-23 21:58:03,kj0tlu,BUT CUDI ALBUM WAS ONE OF THE BEST OF ALL TIME
23091,2020-12-24 03:46:08,kj0tlu,Eminent not even charting ? Will his be next week or was it cause he stopped a bit late
23092,2020-12-24 00:44:30,kj0tlu,"Anyone else find it curious how pop albums like Taylor Swift Etc. always have so many physical sales, while Rap/Hip Hop sales are almost entirely streaming? I wonder if older listeners generally buy albums while younger listeners stream, but it is definitely an interesting sales trend"
23093,2020-12-23 21:37:11,kj0tlu,"Nah, Christmas week charts won’t be until next week"
23094,2020-12-23 22:59:24,kj0tlu,"Honestly, I think everyone I've seen (me included) is unenthusiastic about Mariah going #1. It was cool last year because it never had before, but this year it was just gonna be annoying. The only people who are happy about her going #1 are her stans."
23095,2020-12-23 22:31:55,kj0tlu,Definitely a huge headline but I was keeping it hip hop related
23096,2020-12-24 03:09:14,kj0tlu,Christmas week counts next week and Christmas Day is counted in two weeks
23097,2020-12-23 23:30:41,kj0tlu,"I used to see them all the time on the front page, now i have to seek them out,its weird."
23098,2020-12-24 00:48:30,kj0tlu,"Idk how to explain it properly, but I think the pandemic might have lowkey affected the interest of these posts.

Also, like the other dude said, music has been dry af this year."
23099,2020-12-24 02:29:35,kj0tlu,"Mainstream stuff feels stale rn idk, ive personally been digging through older or new niche stuff because im just not into the popping music right now."
23100,2020-12-24 02:23:36,kj0tlu,Not sure but I might throw up a bot that notifies people when the billboard thread comes out every week if that's something people would be interested in
23101,2020-12-24 00:26:27,kj0tlu,music is dry af right now
23102,2020-12-24 04:15:22,kj0tlu,i usually like looking at billboard and stuff but at some pt it got old to me esp w the merch bundles/artificial number 1s
23103,2020-12-24 04:58:34,kj0tlu,R/hhh in general gets upset when numbers are brought up because artists like Freddie Gibbs do terrible on the charts.
23104,2020-12-24 02:24:43,kj0tlu,No discount as far as I’m aware (I bought merch from her site last week)
23105,2020-12-23 22:55:25,kj0tlu,I feel like back in the day big artists could scheme to get a #1 album but now it's basically impossible. Taylor just drops a huge album out of nowhere and pretty much no one can compete with her numbers.
23106,2020-12-24 01:18:06,kj0tlu,"Sad bois got Cudi, let the hoes have Taylor."
23107,2020-12-24 06:24:14,kj0tlu,yes she did
23108,2020-12-23 23:26:55,kj0tlu,"i honestly liked folklore a lot better, evermore kinda felt like folklore leftovers with less inspiration"
23109,2020-12-24 00:55:30,kj0tlu,I liked folklore a bit more but Evermore is great. Ivy and Cowboy like me are probably my two favorites. Both in my top 10 albums this year and I wasn’t  a Taylor fan until now
23110,2021-03-11 15:38:58,kj0tlu,folklore and evermore are amazing - definitely among the best albums of 2020.
23111,2020-12-24 04:16:38,kj0tlu,i just dont understand the point of buying a digital copy in 2020. you're just flushing money down the toilet to put more money in the pockets of a millionaire
23112,2020-12-24 04:51:46,kj0tlu,there are songs i listen to on release day or whatever then a couple months later i'll do a re-listen an there's songs I'll end up putting in my rotation that i disregarded before or felt i didn't like.
23113,2020-12-24 04:52:34,kj0tlu,next week. probably looking at number 3 cause Taylor sales are strong and paul McCartney dropped.
23114,2020-12-24 01:24:10,kj0tlu,"It's more to due with Taylor having devoted fans, same with Eminem or BTS."
23115,2020-12-24 01:04:34,kj0tlu,Taylor fans are probably of the same age as many hip hop listeners. She’s been around for a long time.
23116,2020-12-24 02:00:30,kj0tlu,until billboard changes the rules it is going to be a yearly thing.
23117,2020-12-23 23:34:40,kj0tlu,I used to love the discussion
23118,2020-12-24 17:34:48,kj0tlu,"I just found this on the front page, so things are back to normal."
23119,2020-12-24 05:35:47,kj0tlu,"Do it. I love these threads and think there's potential for them to get a lot more traffic. But as people are saying, I've barely seen them for a few months whereas they used to always be in Popular"
23120,2020-12-23 23:48:53,kj0tlu,I wouldn’t say nobody. Adele or Drake would put up a hell of a fight.
23121,2020-12-24 01:47:58,kj0tlu,Folklore felt more focused but evermore felt more interesting and varied. Honestly liked the later a lot more
23122,2020-12-24 17:52:07,kj0tlu,its so their favs go #1 so they can shitpost about it on stan twitter. legit
23123,2020-12-27 07:18:36,kj0tlu,It's still a great choice for people who live or often stay in places with bad internet.
23124,2020-12-24 18:02:23,kj0tlu,Yeah sucks his #1 streak will not continue but dropping during Taylor and Paul won’t work now
23125,2020-12-24 03:34:29,kj0tlu,"Great point, but I guess then I am curious why it seems that pop artists have way more devoted fans generally than hip hop artists."
23126,2020-12-24 10:48:55,kj0tlu,"I defo think it's an age thing too. I guarantee artists like Ariana/Drake/Uzi/Lil Baby have way more fans under 21 than Taylor does these days and they don't buy, they stream instead"
23127,2020-12-24 01:09:26,kj0tlu,"Yeah I would guess that there are a lot more Taylor Swift listeners above the age of 25 than Kid Cudi or Jack Harlow for instance.

I mean another example is while Carrie Underwood and Pop Smoke had about the same amount of weekly sales, Carrie had 25k physical sales and Pop Smoke had 300.

My guess is that people above the age of 25-30 or so generally just buy albums instead of streaming them, and pop has much more older listeners than hip hop."
23128,2020-12-24 02:19:27,kj0tlu,What rules are you talking about? The rule where christmas exists?
23129,2020-12-24 02:14:40,kj0tlu,To what though?
23130,2020-12-23 23:54:30,kj0tlu,Drake and Adele would 100 percent outsell taylor now that there are no physical bundles counting.  Scorpion sold 744k without any physical bundles and 25 sold 3 million (lmao) before physical bundles even became the norm
23131,2020-12-24 19:10:42,kj0tlu,"Does it really count? It’s not a whole new album, it’s just a B side of a current album. (Although I’m aware it’s pretty much an album worth of new songs)"
23132,2020-12-24 05:25:05,kj0tlu,It'd also be interesting to know how likely the female demographic is likely to buy physicals compared to the male demographic. That might have something to do with it as well as pop music listeners tend to heavily skew female.
23133,2020-12-24 10:50:37,kj0tlu,"the artists with ""devoted fans"" are all artists that blew up like 10+ years ago. I don't think that's how it really works, it's all an age group thing... people 25+ way more likely to buy rather than stream 

&#x200B;

the only exception is BTS but they're just a freak of nature. Never seen anyone elses fans act that way"
23134,2020-12-24 02:03:56,kj0tlu,"> Yeah I would guess that there are a lot more Taylor Swift listeners above the age of 25 than Kid Cudi or Jack Harlow for instance.

I mean jack for sure but cudi? if you were in high school when he came up you are like 25-28 now."
23135,2020-12-24 02:31:05,kj0tlu,Like reentry rules or something but i don't think there is a way to stop Christmas from dominating that does not have other unwanted consequences
23136,2020-12-24 02:29:58,kj0tlu,Idk i am not sure i would even be comfortable with a change TBH.
23137,2020-12-24 00:28:12,kj0tlu,if Adele comes she will destroy everyone lol. 3 million is absolutely insane. I remember Hello was so fucking big.
23138,2020-12-24 03:33:09,kj0tlu,"I mean I think you could say the same thing about Taylor Swift, but you are right, Cudi has been around for quite a while now and many of his biggest fans are in that age group."
23139,2020-12-24 04:44:32,kj0tlu,"ironically enough the rules used to be that Christmas songs went recurrent after appearing on the chart once. this is still true for non-holiday songs but a couple of years ago billboard changed the rules for Christmas songs allowing it to re-chart. another funny thing is that the song didn't even chart on billboard until 2000 because at the time of release, singles had to be available for physical purchase and it originally was not (it was obviously available as part of her album but not as a standalone like the rules required it to be). so blame billboard for changing the rules.

i do have to give her credit because that's one of relatively few Christmas songs from after, like, the 50s that people have started considering a classic holiday song. there are others, you could argue, but not quite as big as it."
23140,2020-12-24 01:38:50,kj0tlu,"Adele just hits that crazy age range, and an age range that's willing to just straight up buy her physical CDs too."
23141,2020-12-24 10:16:46,kj0tlu,Last Christmas has a movie named about it easily a classic
23142,2020-12-23 18:42:46,kixclj,This is amazing!!!

23158,2020-12-22 19:50:38,kibkqs,Ah yes the owning Drake and Edmonds conundrum continues.

Swift vs Hunt (PPR) ?"
23173,2020-12-22 19:09:17,kibkqs,"I second that. I'll be surprised if Mostert plays. We still don't know the severity of Wilson's injury either though, unfortunately."
23174,2020-12-22 20:43:13,kibkqs,"I need to pick 2: Wilsom, Dobbins, David Johnson. The Mostert news is making it difficult."
23175,2020-12-22 22:49:44,kibkqs,I appreciate the 49ers for shutting him down before Wednesday. Opens up a player that I can grab off the wire.
23176,2020-12-23 02:15:28,kibkqs,"Yep. 

Hes been relatively consistent for the past few weeks. But they just bodied philly and he did jack shit.  Him not being involved in the pass game pisses me off.  The man shines in open field. But they keep bringing Edmonds out there.  Like it's not obvious what they're doing when Edmonds is in the backfield

I'm most likely gonna flex kittle this week. And I'm debating whether to sit drake or dobbins.  I'm having flashbacks of drake taking me to a championship last year.  Does he do it again?"
23177,2020-12-23 01:59:14,kibkqs,dude what if drake goes off in this one he promised a fantasy championship on Twitter they are playing sf at home against their 3rd string qb. only huge downside is fucking kyler having so many runs I hope he gets rocked and gets scared to run

23181,2020-12-22 21:10:41,kibkqs,"I have both, small chance I end up starting both but I feel better about Swift than Hunt. TB run D is obviously scary but Swift gets enough targets that he has a safe floor, and he is getting the RZ looks lately so a TD or 2 is possible. Hunt just isn't getting consistent enough use for me anymore... I mean he has one game over 10 points in half PPR over the last month, and that was a game with like 90 combined points. He could always get a 4th quarter TD or something but I don't see the Jets putting up enough points for him to get that many touches."
23182,2020-12-22 19:12:05,kibkqs,Well there’s the news. Mostert out for season
23183,2020-12-23 18:35:46,kibkqs,"Get fucked wishing for a player to get rocked. Seriously, go to hell that's real life shit, grow up."
23184,2020-12-22 20:10:27,kibkqs,"Yeah, if Zeke is out, I think I might have to play Pollard over Swift in my FLex"
23185,2020-12-23 00:06:55,kibkqs,"Yep, I’m benching Hunt again so watch him put up 30. Swift still seems to have a higher floor at this point though, for sure"
23186,2020-12-22 19:13:02,kibkqs,Hopefully Wilson's ankle is okay
23187,2020-12-24 18:22:13,kibkqs,The fuck lol it’s football dumbass people get destroyed every game stop being a bitch I didn’t call for him to get seriously hurt
23188,2020-12-22 20:19:44,kibkqs,"Not saying it's a bad play, but Eagles rush D is typically pretty stout."
23189,2020-12-22 20:17:25,kibkqs,He said it was perfectly cromulent.

Mariah was very smart for being protective about her music publishing. Her music catalog has got to be the one of the most highly valued ones - although its very unlikely that she will sell it.

Barring a chart rule change, its shaping to be her biggest song on the billboard charts and could be her third song of the decade."

23274,2020-12-22 21:27:43,khwbxv,"Yes, i personally feel like they should count youtube because they market this chart as a more ""streams heavy"" and its weird that they dont include one of the biggest streaming plataforms, even if they weight them less because it counts as free streams i think thay should consider them.

23275,2020-12-22 03:05:26,khtty3,"This core has been notoriously bad at getting started the past few years. And for some reason the Benn era Stars have had a tendency to massively overperform when expectations were low and do the exact opposite and wilt away when expectations were high. On top of that we are a very streaky team who is without some of our top players to start the year.

I know people want to write us in a lock for the playoffs but I'm worried that in a shortened season we might take too long to get going or hit a bad stretch and it will all but take us out of the picture."
23276,2020-12-22 00:30:59,khtty3,"TB, Dal, Car, Cbj

Just a guess. This is a really great and interesting write up. Thanks for taking the time"
23277,2020-12-22 03:38:02,khtty3,I think with no seguin it's gonna be tough for the stars to win the division. Should make playoffs easily though. Don't think you touched on no seguin for basically the season enough. It's basically an out player
23278,2020-12-22 04:46:13,khtty3,Very excited for the new division opponents.
23279,2020-12-22 00:49:15,khtty3,"Chicago will be better than 7. A hungry Dallas team might win it out right, but usually we play around for third and then strike hard in the playoffs."
23280,2020-12-22 02:00:58,khtty3,"So I'm curious, does Bishop come back as 1a and Dobby at 1b and then Otter at 3?  I'd be curious to see what kind of ice time the Cedar Park boys get during the regular season. We obviously can't coast it in to the post season, and we need to be agressive but gotta wonder about Dallendrea and the like getting significan minutes."
23281,2020-12-22 04:01:31,khtty3,I’m choosing to be cautiously optimistic about next season. Losing Seguin and Bishop for 90% of the season will be tough but I think they will be fine. Essentially I think this season comes down to whether Jamie has a bounce back regular season and at times over the last few years I feel like he’s struggled to stay motivated. After losing the finals I’m hoping that will give him the motivation to be an offensive weapon again. Art Ross Jamie is gone but we need him to constantly produce.
23282,2020-12-22 07:58:44,khtty3,"I’m going to go:
1. Carolina - elite scoring but top heavy. Think this is the year they make a jump. Aho and Svechnikov are supremely talented. 
2. Tampa - could see in the regular season a slow start but they heat up as we go. They were really bad the first half of last year, so I don’t think they are a shoe in. 
3. Dallas - Seguin and Bishop injuries hurt, need young guns shine early and often. Think we see a lot of hot and cold hockey again, going to depend on what JFK, Dellandrea and Robertson give us. Jamie better get everyone’s head right in camp. If we were in the pacific it’d be a cake walk to top 4. I could see us finishing as high as 1 and as low as 6 in the Central. 
4. Nashville - Rebound year. Think that team was in their own head last year. Granlund hurts but Duschene I think finally gels with that roster. Roman Josi still a top 3 defender. 
5. Florida - Striking out on Panarin hurt last year and Bobrovsky has been a waste of money. A lot of talent though. Could see them sneaking in the playoffs and being a tough out. 
6. CBJ - Always a tough out. Not sure the mindset behind the Anderson for Domi swap. Torts squeezes so much out of that roster but too much talent above them. They struggle in the regular season. 
7. Chicago - Do they even know who is playing goalie yet?
8. Detroit - Pretty stoked we play them 8 times. Have to go at least 6-2 or a colossal failure."
23283,2020-12-22 12:52:10,khtty3,So aren't we only playing the teams in our division? I can't remember where I heard that
23284,2020-12-22 14:58:16,khtty3,"2nd or 3rd imo. Tampa will be first, but I think Carolina could challenge us for 2nd."
23285,2020-12-22 17:12:29,khtty3,"Tampa, Carolina, Dallas, Columbus

I have Carolina ahead of Dallas because their style seems like it plays better in the regular season and lives on a knife’s edge in the postseason, particularly with that goalie tandem. 

However, a shorter season with an older roster might pay big dividends in Dallas if you consider the Blackhawks in 2013"
23286,2020-12-22 17:29:12,khtty3,"I agree with your final standings, I think Dallas will probably be #2 or #3.  I think Nashville and Florida have potential to be in the top 4 as well.  I also think Carolina is a good team, but always seems to be a little overrated.  

I will also predict that Columbus will be the team the Stars struggle the most against in the division."
23287,2020-12-22 17:35:51,khtty3,"Out after first round - Chicago, Carolina, Columbus


Out after qualifying rounds: Predators, Panthers


All those teams are well rested.  Hopefully The Captain returns in fine shape.  And Faksa, also injured in playiffs and off the ice for months.  I don't feel like anyone will opt out.  I think Stars get to finals again.  I think Bowness being head coach helps this greatly."
23288,2020-12-22 19:26:55,khtty3,"Excellent analysis, really appreciate you taking the time. I agree except I will say I think Jamie is still pretty sore about losing the Cup. And I think it's going to show up big time on the ice. I don't think any of the usual trends we've seen from this team will apply - i.e. their lack of clutch factor. This is between Jamie and the Cup now. The man is on a mission. You heard it here first!"
23289,2020-12-25 08:02:14,khtty3,"This is the correct answer. The only thing I think helps the stars is the fact that tampa is in our division giving us something to prove. Otherwise with no new changes really and betting solely on goaltending, we aren't looking too dominant"
23290,2020-12-22 03:54:06,khtty3,"Bishop's also out for most of the season, too. That's amazing for Oettinger's development, but not sure if that's good for the team's overall performance ."
23291,2020-12-22 13:28:18,khtty3,We had an injured Seguin that only scored 2G in 26 games in the playoffs and were two wins away from the Cup. I think we'll be fine.
23292,2020-12-22 04:59:46,khtty3,The Tampa rivalry is going to be interesting lol
23293,2020-12-22 08:15:47,khtty3,Their goaltending situation is simply horrendous and Dach is fantastic but needs to learn to score. I don’t have high hopes for them so long as Keith/Kane/Toews are making $35 mil /season combined.
23294,2020-12-22 01:42:34,khtty3,I disagree. Chicago doesn’t have much to think they will be good
23295,2020-12-22 03:51:33,khtty3,"Bishop's recovery from surgery timetable is about the same as Seguin's, so it will either be a Khudobin-Oettinger tandem or Oettinger backing up Dobby."
23296,2020-12-22 13:16:40,khtty3,Yep. 8 games against each.
23297,2020-12-22 04:07:13,khtty3,Eh. I'm not too concerned with that since we will have khduobin. Definitely true though. Bishop will be out
23298,2020-12-22 14:38:27,khtty3,"Never said we won't? Said it's gonna be tough to win division, which has TB in it, who we lost to in the finals. We aren't beating them with an AHL replacement , seguins defense and FOs still much better than any AHLer"
23299,2020-12-22 06:05:40,khtty3,"If it was me, I'd eat Bish's salary and he can get healthy, and get Otter in there because Seattle is gonna fuck us.  We did luck out with Manny Fernandez, but hey."
23300,2020-12-22 13:17:24,khtty3,This will be an interesting season!
23301,2020-12-24 00:19:51,khhmoa,"Great analysis.  I knew some of this but learned some things from your breakdown.

1) The (bed) covers thing is pretty obvious once you see it... I missed it until you pointed it out.  

2) Sarah ""in the car"".  I missed that one too.  Yes, she was the passive one this season.  Great job and helps to clarify things even further than I did.

3) Jill/Shaw taking Chuck/Sarah off the grid.  Missed that too..

I couldn't agree more about Sarah and Shaw's dynamics either.  It's something that is missed by people who think she was falling for him.  Check out  Sarah's expressions to things that Shaw did even after they were together.  For instance, when  Shaw interrupted Chuck and Sarah's moment (phone call) at the stakeout, checkout her expression when Chuck answers the phone... not exactly that of a woman who is glad to hear from her boyfriend.  Also,  when she got back to Castle during the first half of the final test.  She couldn't even look at Shaw.  Shaw was not someone who held her heart.  He was someone to help forget about Chuck.

Great job.  I think this is why this show is so discussed.  You get caught up in it at first without knowing exactly why but once you start pulling it apart, you realize how much art went into it and why it is so compelling."
23302,2020-12-21 14:27:42,khhmoa,"Read about half of it, gotta go to work now. But excellent analysis :) would be great to see it for other important episodes. Doing a whole season at once is a lot doh, very impressive."
23303,2020-12-21 16:56:22,khhmoa,"Wow, great analysis"
23304,2020-12-21 18:24:00,khhmoa,Amazing work [u/fscinico](https://www.reddit.com/user/fscinico/) !  How do you even do this where you embed images with your text in the post?  Got a pointer to a tutorial?  :-)
23305,2020-12-25 17:49:22,khhmoa,"Wow, this is like Holy Graal for Chuck's fans!
And after 3rd rewatch I also think, that season 3 is reversal to season 1. Sarah often feel and act like Chuck in the begining of the series. And scenes comparison about Chuck/ Sarah covers and their faces? Brilliant!


Love it! Pls continue this analysis until last season!

And one more, do you also noticed guys: after Episode 14, Chuck and Sarah reversed their places in bed practically until series finale? Chuck take left side of the bed, and Sarah is taking Chuck's side from previous, cover relationship. Funny."
23306,2021-05-04 22:31:49,khhmoa,"Respect. You put in words what I suspected, but not yet managed to piece together. My utmost respect. I am rewatching right now, and this will make it even better. I am at ""the ex"" right now, so it only is about to begin in full."
23307,2020-12-22 03:42:31,khhmoa,"[u/fscinico](https://www.reddit.com/user/fscinico/), your analysis is beyond amazing.  How do you perceive all of these subtle themes, reversals, parallels, etc.?  Does it come naturally or do you have special training?

Also, it is not nearly as amazing but nevertheless impressive is that the writers put in this much depth in their work.  You are inferring that the writers intentionally wrote the show how you analyzed it, correct?"
23308,2020-12-23 01:13:03,khhmoa,"Wow. You make quite the film critic. Well done.  Season 3 is awesome, and  I picked up on a lot of these parallels, but not nearly as many as you outline here. And with your analysis of the major themes running through each episode, it's become clear to me why this show is so popular. There are a lot of shows with hot girls, fun action, and romance, but the character development here is crazy good.   Your analysis helped me pick up on that.

The whole *feelings work for spies* thing really pops out in the final episode of season 3 when Chuck beat Shaw in a fight but doesn't kill him. Shaw says, ""That's what makes you weak."" Sarah clonks him over the head and says, ""No, that's what makes you great.""  Awesome moment."
23309,2020-12-25 03:07:47,khhmoa,"good analysis, I saw that you took ideas from some of our conversations. Honestly though s4 and s5 are the mirrors of s1 and s2. the last 2 episodes of s5 are the reverse of the first 2 of s1, as well as the fact that the enemy of s1 appears in 1x09 and the enemy of s5 appears in 5x09. In s2 the season explores the closeness and impossibility of chuck and sarah's relationship, while s4 explores their relationship and relationship possibility. Unfortunately I must say that s3 still does not convince me despite all these parallels you have faced and recognized by me as already stated previously. It also makes Sarah not very smart, if she doesn't recognize Chuck's heroic deed in Prague, thinking it selfish and vice versa with Shaw, the matter is a bit complicated. Also you say that they try to reverse roles, to reverse roles Sarah had to go civil and not Casey, while she remains a spy and opens up with Shaw, another spy, grave mistake. Chuck also understands his mistake with Hannah, she doesn't. We add the fact that many reverse roles take place when they are out of relationships, which she has with Shaw, an unrivaled trust in her life. Not to mention, Chuck makes the decisions himself about Sarah's trust after Mauser, while she needs Casey's intervention. She gives Shaw a real part of her that Chuck will never have, such as trust, real name, secrets. is a bit like Jason Bourne, his real name is David Web. Like Sarah is Sam, the girl who never went and stayed inside Agent Walker. Agent Walker, or rather Sarah Walker, is an alias and a cover for Sam Lisa. I conclude by saying that s3 is really uninhibited and meaningless, you can't just pour things halfway, if you wanted to reverse the roles, it should have been done better."

23311,2020-12-22 13:57:10,khhmoa,"Thank you for your kind words. It's really neither training nor natural ability. It's more the desire to better understand a story I like. Once the writers give us the key (role reversal, hero's journey, narrative counterpoint) to unlock the structure of the story, it's a matter of using that key to see how deep the rabbit hole goes.

Yes, I think Schwedak put that much (and more) depth in their work. Artists are like that and take a lot of pride in it (and it also helps them develop and tell the story). There's always a ton of symbolic subtext in the best stories, and the visual medium (TV, movies) allows for a ton of interplay and layering of visual, aural, body language, and non-verbal communication. That's why, when we watch a story we like multiple times, we always notice something new we hadn't noticed before. 

In *Chuck*, you can see from the screenshots I added to the post that some parallel scenes were even shot from the same (or mirrored) camera angle, with Chuck and Sarah having the same emotional reaction and facial expression as the other in an earlier season. None of this is random, especially in this show, which relies heavily on narrative counterpoint and internal references to itself and external references to other movies and TV shows."
23312,2020-12-25 04:02:53,khhmoa,"The role reversal is not absolute. It would have been too obvious (like in season 5). It's much better when it's subtle.

The reason Sarah trusted Shaw is because she had switched roles. She was Chuck and Shaw was Sarah the handler, and S1-2 Chuck trusted his handler Sarah, so Sarah trusted Shaw. Schwedak wanted Sarah to walk in Chuck's shoes.

Prague was needed so that Chuck and Sarah could set each other free and come back to each other freely and to set up the role reversal for the season.

I think Sarah had already made the decision by herself, before Casey's visit, just as Chuck made the decision himself after Mauser. You can see that she was already almost convinced at the restaurant and didn't even bring up Perry the next day during Chuck's love declaration. As per the song lyrics right before their kiss, she was going to take a chance on something, she was trusting Chuck even without a full understanding of the incident, just as Chuck trusted her explanation about Mauser in 2.12. Casey's admission was needed to dissolve any doubts.

Chuck got the very same part Sarah gave Shaw since he listened to the conversation. There was nothing Shaw knew about Sarah that Chuck didn't also know. And that confession to Shaw was done because she was basically Chuck (open and trusting) and Schwedak needed a way for Chuck to listen to those words but in a way that would shock him back into being Chuck."

23314,2020-12-23 04:45:16,khhmoa,"[u/fscinico](https://www.reddit.com/user/fscinico/), even before your analysis on S3, I thought that you could be a professor of film studies. As you are a person with so much insight, I am interested in your opinion of couple of things that puzzle me about Chuck.

1. With all the talent that these artists have and the hard work that they put into their craft, how could they mess up so badly on the ending to the show i.e., S5E13?  I realize that many fans like it but the vast majority appear to hate it. I believe from reading your earlier posts that you are not a fan of the ending either.
2. The creators and the stars appear to want a Chuck movie. The show has a loyal following of old and new fans. With all the bad movies that the streaming services produces and squander their money on, why can't they get a Chuck movie produced? The only thing I can think of is that one of the main stars may be asking for too much money.  Do you have any thoughts as to why they cannot produce a Chuck movie?

Thank you in advance"
23315,2020-12-25 10:46:02,khhmoa," but, anyway sara didn't need a conductor, they had to make her civil Chuck trusts Sarah in s1 and s2, Sarah had to trust Chuck in s3 to reverse it well, I always had my idea of ​​s3, and this yours nice analysis, unfortunately it does not change it, I remain convinced of my idea, on Sarah's part, giving Shaw all that trust is wrong because: 

1) spies don't trust anyone 

2) especially she never trusts anyone, remember 5x08

 3) if the roles were reversed, she had to trust Chuck unconditionally, as he trusts her unconditionally in s1 and s2, when he had no reason. Let's remember that Sarah may sacrifice her career, but he entrusts his life and that of his family to her, which is so much more.

 4) Fedak looks for symmetries even with the protagonists' red tests and unfortunately brings Shaw back to life, the most serious mistake of the show as it cancels one of the most symbolic and significant gestures of the protagonist, only to give an enemy at the end of s3, in how much they hadn't designed one.

 5) if after s3 Sarah does not trust Chuck completely, s3 is useless at this point.

 6) Sarah is not having a relationship with anyone in s1 and s2, so Chuck shouldn't have the relationship too 

7) Unfortunately, Sarah's part in the role of Chuck is denied by the fact that in 3x09,3x10 and 3x11 she is still the manager of him. 

8) after Mauser, Chuck still trusts Sarah, she after Perry doesn't, she still trusts Shaw in 3x13 when he warns her about Shaw's emotions, this is even worse, because they were already a couple. 

9) they don't even discuss his real name anymore, it would have been logical to give one.

 10) as I said s5 and s4, they have more symmetries with s1 and s2, compared to s3.

 As I told you about Mauser and the scene in 2x22 ""I leave tomorrow and I leave with Bryce"" which is the real mirror, and the real reverse for reasons of closeness of the protagonists and emotions like Prague, as well as 2x22 is  the reverse of Uniot station, as it happens after a heroic gesture of one towards the other.

 Anyway I repeat, you did a good job looking for symmetries and trying to explain in your own way what the writers wanted to do. You did a great job! That said, I wish you ""Merry Christmas"""

23317,2020-12-23 15:53:05,khhmoa,"1. I think the majority of fans like the finale but I don't. I think it's a story-telling mistake to erase the memory of a main character in a character-based story. This is one example where they pushed the role reversal too far (make Sarah scared and lost in the finale as Chuck was in the pilot).
2. I think I've read that Zach said it's tough because it's like a dog chasing its tail; the studio owns the rights to the story and Zach has a hard time convincing writers to write a story without having the rights to it."
23318,2020-12-25 13:44:58,khhmoa,"Merry Christmas to you as well.

Remember that the objective of S3 was not to have a 100% role reversal. That would have been impossible. It was to have Chuck and Sarah walk in each other's shoes, to have them **feel** what the other had felt for the first two seasons, to have them **see** things from the other's perspective, so that they could be equally yoked by 3.13. Season 3 wasn't meant to complete all their character and relationship growth, which continued in the remaining two seasons.

So, in the first two seasons, Chuck wanted *real* while Sarah pursues her career. In S3, Chuck pursues his career while Sarah wants real. In S1, Chuck first distrusted then trusted his physical handler Sarah. In S3, Sarah distrusts and then trusts her symbolic handler Shaw. In S1-2, Chuck had two love interests, Lou from his ordinary world and Jill the ex, and Sarah had two love interests, Cole from her special world and Bryce the ex. In S3, they both experience half of a real life with their love interests, Chuck the ordinary-world half and Sarah the special-world half. In S1-3, Chuck has three one-week (approximately) girlfriends, and Sarah has one three-week (approximately) boyfriend. In S1-2, Sarah was Chuck's savior. In S3, Chuck is Sarah's savior.

Sarah's real name was Sarah. That's the name on her marriage license. There was nothing to discuss. Chuck intentionally called her Sarah Walker in his 3.12 love declaration. The name Sam was given to Shaw to symbolize the fact that S3 Sarah was looking for **real** in her relationship with Shaw and could not find it because Shaw was 100% spy and ""nothing is real"" in the spy life. And Chuck stopped caring about people's names in 2.04 *Cougars*. He cares about **who they are** because that's what's **real** about people. That's what he tells Sarah at the end of 2.04 *Cougars* and to Casey in 3.10 *Tic Tac*.

Viewers get all hung up on Sarah/Shaw and trust but literally the only thing Sarah revealed to Shaw was her birth name (for the reason above) and that's it.

And the fact she trusted him in 3.13 was to prove the point about ""feelings as a liability"" in the spy world. It was to show that feelings are not always a liability since Chuck's feelings for Sarah ended up saving her life while Beckman's idea that Shaw was an absolute professional not hampered by feelings was **wrong**.

I'm not saying the season was perfect or that I loved it. I just wanted to clarify what I think Schwedak wanted to convey."

23320,2020-12-24 01:45:45,khhmoa,Thank you.
23321,2020-12-25 15:12:50,khhmoa,"I understand your point and respect it, but I disagree. The only thing that is not reversible in life is death, so neither chuck nor sarah were dead, they could reverse roles better, instead of civil casey we should have had a civil sarah, sarah was the super spy of the CIA, let her have her a mentor didn't make sense, chuck needed a mentor in the spy world as an apprentice, while Sarah needed a mentor in the civilized world. It made more sense to have chuck have a female mentor with a love interest and sarah a romantic interest in the civilized world, so the roles were reversible and doable. Fedak has always traced the fact that spys do not trust anyone, chuck had to be for Sarah the only exception that confirms the rule, at the limit Casey could have been fine, as we have seen, but it takes years, not a few days, to destroy the Sarah's character to grow Chuck's made little sense."
23322,2020-12-25 15:22:17,khhmoa,"A female mentor for Chuck and a civilian love interest for Sarah would have also been a viable way of telling the story, and one that most viewers would have understood better, the same way that putting Harry with Hermione instead of Ginny would also have been a viable way of telling the *Harry Potter* story, and one that many readers would have preferred. That's beside the point.

It's not implausible that Sarah would trust Shaw after 3.05 *First Class*. He'd shown her his method worked. He bonded with her over the common loss of a loved one. He came recommended by Beckman. Sarah respected the chain of command. She was always shown as respectful of her superiors, other than in 3.14 when she ignored Beckman's calls and then told her she and Chuck were dating and that Beckman had to get on with it."
23323,2020-12-25 17:43:40,khhmoa,"his method works, not so much, we have already discussed this, only a blind man does not notice the madness of his rescue plan. The comparison with Harry and Hermione is a bit out of place, I think at least there the plot is spot on, nothing to take away from Fedak, however done an acceptable job despite the problems over time, but the reversible roles are told better and in a way more truthful. Distorting the characters is one thing, going through other ways to develop them would have been better, consider that anyway, sarah respects the superirors but apart from Graham she doesn't completely trust them, Quinn in s5 is the perfect example, as well as Beckman in some s2 situations, shaw was no different from other spies, the mere fact that he listens to her is implausible for that trust, just as she always criticized Chuck for his feelings, she never questions Shaw's emotions, no sane of chin would give confidence after everything he has seen, words matter little, in the end it is the facts that spea"

A few days ago some team pumped fake ""air ball!"" crowd chants into the arena;  should TD pump in boos for Kyrie, for authenticity on his return to Boston?


Anyway, I'm just happy to be watching basketball...been a bright spot in a shit year for all of us.

23562,2020-12-19 01:54:58,kfwxkb,Wonder how many people will predict the nets to miss the playoffs after this one. They look incredible
23563,2020-12-19 02:32:27,kfwxkb,Kyrie is only 1 year older than Anthony Davis
23564,2020-12-19 02:09:41,kfwxkb,Remember that bad trade the Nets made with the Celtics years back and everyone thought The Nets gave the Celtics a potential dynasty while screwing their own future. It's amazing how things flipped. The Nets now are in much primer position to win a title after each teams journey.
23565,2020-12-19 02:53:51,kfwxkb,KD is gonna be the new LeBron for the Celtics for the next 5 years lmfao. Just gonna dick them down every postseason
23566,2020-12-19 01:04:27,kfwxkb,CC Sabathia is calling the game on YES tonight
23567,2020-12-19 01:08:57,kfwxkb, Liking the preview from ESPN
23568,2020-12-19 01:11:41,kfwxkb,"I try to go to two Celtics games per year.  I usually do one pricier game with a better team, and one cheaper game.  Nets would have been nice - I'd like to see Durant in person before he starts to decline.  Not saying it's happening in the next year or two, but it'll happen eventually.  *Cries in Covid*"
23569,2020-12-19 01:12:37,kfwxkb,Jarrett Allen is rolling in his grave watching those possessions by DJ
23570,2020-12-19 01:12:40,kfwxkb,Theis is nice
23571,2020-12-19 01:14:57,kfwxkb,It's great to see KD out there again
23572,2020-12-19 01:15:04,kfwxkb,Kevin Durant
23573,2020-12-19 01:15:05,kfwxkb,"Heh, everyone's still a little preseason-y of course, both teams"
23574,2020-12-19 01:15:49,kfwxkb,That was a quick move by kd
23575,2020-12-19 01:16:12,kfwxkb,This new score bug looks so dumb to me. Why are the scores pushed to the bottom left of the screen? Why is the bottom third a useless NBA Friday and ESPN display? Shit is cheeks
23576,2020-12-19 01:16:16,kfwxkb,What are those pink shoes KD is wearing?
23577,2020-12-19 01:16:18,kfwxkb,KD clowning these fools. He ain't even got his legs yet.😲
23578,2020-12-19 01:16:34,kfwxkb,man i missed r/nba game threads
23579,2020-12-19 01:18:25,kfwxkb,KD looks 💯
23580,2020-12-19 01:19:03,kfwxkb,"kd looks good, hope it's real"
23581,2020-12-19 01:19:29,kfwxkb,Get deandres fat ass outta there. Man can’t even get an offensive rebound with his hands around the ball
23582,2020-12-19 01:19:34,kfwxkb,Nets offense have looked very seamless in both games so far. There were a little bit of confusions vs Wizards but they got better as the game went on
23583,2020-12-19 01:19:41,kfwxkb,"Crazy part I'm a Sixers fan and the only way I think anybody beats the Nets is if Harden comes over to the East and even that is a long shot.

KD a problem!"
23584,2020-12-19 01:20:04,kfwxkb,I would eagerly bet my life savings that once fans are allowed in Boston Kyrie is injured
23585,2020-12-19 01:23:28,kfwxkb,If the nets entire team got hot it’d be scary
23586,2020-12-19 01:23:40,kfwxkb,is it blasphemous to suggest Dinwiddie shouldn't start?
23587,2020-12-19 01:24:09,kfwxkb,Jarret allen scores in 30 seconds of gametime while DJ didn’t do shit
23588,2020-12-19 01:24:26,kfwxkb,i bet you dinwiddie has made a bundle on TSLA in the last year
23589,2020-12-19 01:24:40,kfwxkb,...was that a pass? yeah sure lets go with that
23590,2020-12-19 01:25:11,kfwxkb,"Good work, Allen!  His hands were too sloppy for that 2 seasons ago, he's getting better every year"
23591,2020-12-19 01:25:28,kfwxkb,Lmfao Kyrie Irving got completely destroyed by that Robert Williams screen
23592,2020-12-19 01:26:46,kfwxkb,That fro 😱
23593,2020-12-19 01:26:47,kfwxkb,Jarett allan is like 8 foot 1 with the fro
23594,2020-12-19 01:28:18,kfwxkb,"Brooklyn is finally a real team, it's surreal."
23595,2020-12-19 01:29:56,kfwxkb,Wow what an airball
23596,2020-12-19 01:30:20,kfwxkb,The only thing you can do thats worse than shooting that awful airball is fouling for no reason directly after
23597,2020-12-19 01:30:45,kfwxkb,I'm eager to see how the Nets will fare against the 76ers and the Bucks. They don't seem to have the personnel to deal with either Embiid or Giannis.
23598,2020-12-19 01:33:56,kfwxkb,Tatum is def lookin bigger
23599,2020-12-19 01:34:32,kfwxkb,Tatum gained weight but still has the same sized jersey from last season lmao
23600,2020-12-19 01:40:10,kfwxkb,Still feels weird seeing D’Antoni next to Nash
23601,2020-12-19 01:41:00,kfwxkb,Love ya Steve. Love ya Mike
23602,2020-12-19 01:41:09,kfwxkb,The best player in the east is on the Nets crazy
23603,2020-12-19 01:41:42,kfwxkb,Big Waluigi energy
23604,2020-12-19 01:44:09,kfwxkb,Teague is such a ball hog it's annoying
23605,2020-12-19 01:45:28,kfwxkb,"deandre got as many haircuts in quarantine as me: zero

dudes hair is loooong"
23606,2020-12-19 01:47:04,kfwxkb,So Pritchard might not be the next Kemba Walker after all
23607,2020-12-19 01:47:42,kfwxkb,TLC winning minutes with that pass lol
23608,2020-12-19 01:48:06,kfwxkb,Only 2 preason games for the nets?
23609,2020-12-19 01:49:30,kfwxkb,I fucking love it.
23610,2020-12-19 01:49:37,kfwxkb,"fuck whats the line on durant for MVP

im calling my bookie right now"
23611,2020-12-19 01:49:40,kfwxkb,KD!
23612,2020-12-19 01:50:26,kfwxkb,All smiles and hi fives
23613,2020-12-19 01:50:54,kfwxkb,washington generals look like ass tonight
23614,2020-12-19 01:51:52,kfwxkb,Please Steve play Bruce brown 🙏
23615,2020-12-19 01:52:32,kfwxkb,KD absolutely going for 40 on the warriors lmao
23616,2020-12-19 01:52:34,kfwxkb,"Yo KD is really on the Nets this is wild, it’ll be 30 games in and I still don’t think I’ll be used to it"
23617,2020-12-19 01:54:10,kfwxkb,"What a beatdown.  The Celtics look limp, completely impotent."
23618,2020-12-19 01:54:22,kfwxkb,That's not a foul
23619,2020-12-19 01:54:36,kfwxkb,[deleted]
23620,2020-12-19 01:55:32,kfwxkb,Looks like tatum has taken a play out of hardens playbook
23621,2020-12-19 01:55:46,kfwxkb,beautiful sequence from boston right there
23622,2020-12-19 01:56:23,kfwxkb,It'll be interesting if Kyrie and KD popularize the mid-range again.
23623,2020-12-19 01:57:40,kfwxkb,JEFF
23624,2020-12-19 01:58:01,kfwxkb,"JT should’ve done a 720 smh, he don’t got a championship mentality smh my head"
23625,2020-12-19 01:58:13,kfwxkb,Tatum needs to get a haircut before the season starts
23626,2020-12-19 01:58:29,kfwxkb,Jeff Green doing Jeff Green things. Next he'll hit a 3 then go 0-6 the rest of the way
23627,2020-12-19 01:58:31,kfwxkb,Jeff “Sky Walker” Green
23628,2020-12-19 01:58:33,kfwxkb,"Man the forward matchups in the East are gonna be amazing. Giannis, Tatum, KD, Simmons, Butler all facing each other."
23629,2020-12-19 01:58:48,kfwxkb,Glad to have Jeff Green on the team
23630,2020-12-19 02:03:03,kfwxkb,Joey Buckets
23631,2020-12-19 02:06:35,kfwxkb,that was nice
23632,2020-12-19 02:19:31,kfwxkb,lol Robin Lopez with his Barney the dinosaur voice lookin' like Brook disguised as Sideshow Mel
23633,2020-12-19 02:21:24,kfwxkb,"I’ve never had a McRib, are they that good?"
23634,2020-12-19 02:22:17,kfwxkb,JJ lol
23635,2020-12-19 02:31:21,kfwxkb,KD block!
23636,2020-12-19 02:31:41,kfwxkb,"durant is playing really really well

glad hes not in the west"
23637,2020-12-19 02:32:09,kfwxkb,Does KD look hesitant or am I just overanalyzing his movements
23638,2020-12-19 02:32:16,kfwxkb,lmao at Kyrie calling knock down before it even left his hands
23639,2020-12-19 02:32:21,kfwxkb,Daniel Thiess is really bad
23640,2020-12-19 02:37:55,kfwxkb,Tatum needs to shave his head again. After the game in the bubble I don’t trust him anymore with that cut
23641,2020-12-19 02:38:06,kfwxkb,"Tatum's gotta be more consistent if he wants to be a true #1 on a title team.  He still has too many 5-15 games, and he needs more ways to impact the game if he's not shooting well."
23642,2020-12-19 02:38:30,kfwxkb,i know its just preseason but the defense when the starters play these two games have been pretty good
23643,2020-12-19 02:39:06,kfwxkb,not inspiring stuff from the celtics
23644,2020-12-19 02:45:02,kfwxkb,Ok brad stop teasing us. Sub in tacko to tie this up
23645,2020-12-19 02:45:57,kfwxkb,Is kyrie playing I have not noticed him
23646,2020-12-19 02:46:10,kfwxkb,KD the blocker!
23647,2020-12-19 02:48:41,kfwxkb,Nets are gonna make Giannis regret signing
23648,2020-12-19 02:49:12,kfwxkb,"Shit, kd back bros!"
23649,2020-12-19 02:49:29,kfwxkb,Goat 🤣🤣
23650,2020-12-19 02:49:33,kfwxkb,Yes
23651,2020-12-19 02:49:36,kfwxkb,Holy shit KD
23652,2020-12-19 02:49:38,kfwxkb,Wow KD
23653,2020-12-19 03:10:55,kfwxkb,"When KD wins MVP this year, will he say “you da real MVP!” again for old time’s sake?"
23654,2020-12-19 03:13:42,kfwxkb,Did notice that KD’s release point and elevation were lower than before the injury. Makes me think he’s still tentative. Which makes it even more crazy how good he was tonight. Wait until he’s 100% ...
23655,2020-12-19 01:53:07,kfwxkb,"League is fucked lmao

All the nets doubters in for a rude awakening"
23656,2020-12-19 01:51:02,kfwxkb,This Celtic team looks like a potential first round exit. No cap.
23657,2020-12-19 00:00:57,kfwxkb,Finals preview
23658,2020-12-19 01:26:33,kfwxkb,Why do the ESPN score graphics keep getting bigger? Shit is horrendous
23659,2020-12-19 01:27:35,kfwxkb,"I don’t know how they can actually justify starting Jordan over Allen, the difference is staggering"
23660,2020-12-19 01:56:56,kfwxkb,Looking at this Nets team they look great but I feel like the Bucks will be their kryptonite. Jrue on Kyrie and Giannis on KD are literally the two best defenders you’d want on those guys.
23661,2020-12-19 02:01:08,kfwxkb,Some spicy takes on here for a preseason game.
23662,2020-12-19 02:49:37,kfwxkb,"Hot take:

He back"
23663,2020-12-19 02:49:42,kfwxkb,This is brutal
23664,2020-12-19 02:50:11,kfwxkb,"Looks like KD hasn’t lost a damn step


I’m really glad he’s not on the poverty warriors anymore"
23665,2020-12-19 02:52:32,kfwxkb,"So, uh, sit KD now? He’s made his point."
23666,2020-12-19 01:08:19,kfwxkb,Celts gonna lose
23667,2020-12-19 01:37:42,kfwxkb,Solely based on the 1st quarter DeAndre Jordan has no business starting over Jarrett Allen
23668,2020-12-19 01:46:31,kfwxkb,"Literal infant Jason Tatum, second youngest player in the league after literal embryo Ben Simmons"
23669,2020-12-19 01:47:25,kfwxkb,BLOCKED BY LUWAWU-CABARROT
23670,2020-12-19 02:34:28,kfwxkb,hey maybe boston shouldn't have let hayward go for nothing
23671,2020-12-19 02:42:20,kfwxkb,Hard watching the Celtics go through a rebuild
23672,2020-12-19 02:50:52,kfwxkb,why kd still in lol
23673,2020-12-19 02:00:24,kfwxkb,My 2021 resolution is to campaign hard to bring back Ingram > Tatum. I feel like everyone put that to rest far too soon.
23674,2020-12-19 02:32:14,kfwxkb,Celtics going absolutely no where starting Theis
23675,2020-12-19 00:29:40,kfwxkb,Can we spray air freshener whenever we play at Barclays?
23676,2020-12-19 00:48:13,kfwxkb,"Why are the Pistons on this board as an option for ""Teams That Could Beat The Lakers"""

23684,2020-12-19 01:13:29,kfwxkb,My dream is to see an nba game start on time
23685,2020-12-19 01:15:02,kfwxkb,I forgot how much of a cheat code hacker KD is
23686,2020-12-19 01:16:12,kfwxkb,KD
23687,2020-12-19 01:16:13,kfwxkb,What shoes KD wearing?
23688,2020-12-19 01:16:16,kfwxkb,KEVIN. DURANT.
23689,2020-12-19 01:16:31,kfwxkb,Joesefffff
23690,2020-12-19 01:16:32,kfwxkb,durant is going to make the nets good on his own huh
23691,2020-12-19 01:16:50,kfwxkb,"I knew KD has always been a good finisher, but did he really lead the league in efficiency on those?"
23692,2020-12-19 01:17:50,kfwxkb,Marcus the sleeve isn’t causing you to brick 3s
23693,2020-12-19 01:18:15,kfwxkb,Put Allen in please
23694,2020-12-19 01:18:34,kfwxkb,KD/Kyrie good luck stopping that. Sheesh!
23695,2020-12-19 01:18:37,kfwxkb,Pretty sure kd doesnt league the league in efficiency at the rim? Has to be Giannis or lebron.  Kd is a great finisher though. Maybe because he takes way less shots at the rim than them?
23696,2020-12-19 01:18:48,kfwxkb,Traded away KD off my fantasy team already.. regrets creeping in lmao
23697,2020-12-19 01:19:09,kfwxkb,Boston building a house tn with these bricks
23698,2020-12-19 01:20:13,kfwxkb,This feels like a pickup game lol. Kinda respect how both teams arnt going 100% on rebounds / loose balls.
23699,2020-12-19 01:21:15,kfwxkb,Why is DJ starting? Allen would not only give more effort but he can hit free throws
23700,2020-12-19 01:21:20,kfwxkb,"if spencer isnt gonna do anything when kd and kyrie are on the floor, we might as well start brown so our defense is better"
23701,2020-12-19 01:22:01,kfwxkb,"Smart chucking like he was in the playoffs.  I dont watch the celtics alot, did he do that last year in the regular season alot? Its probably gonna be worse now with depth perception back and fans soon."
23702,2020-12-19 01:22:43,kfwxkb,You see how Durant towered over that girl.
23703,2020-12-19 01:22:55,kfwxkb,Nikola Jordan
23704,2020-12-19 01:23:41,kfwxkb,Celtics taking way too many threes

23709,2020-12-19 01:25:21,kfwxkb,Hopefully KD and Kyrie eventually let Allen play more at least
23710,2020-12-19 01:27:05,kfwxkb,Stevie pls don't have Landry shamet run pick and rolls
23711,2020-12-19 01:28:16,kfwxkb,J3ff gr33n
23712,2020-12-19 01:28:35,kfwxkb,So is Deandre going to be starting over Allen?
23713,2020-12-19 01:33:00,kfwxkb,Tatum and Brown need to really shoot more. Smart jacking up 3s is not the road to success.
23714,2020-12-19 01:38:00,kfwxkb,"Dribble the damn air out of the ball, pass the rock Caris"
23715,2020-12-19 01:39:30,kfwxkb,Are two 32 year olds in KD and DeAndre Jordan really going to throw a tantrum if Allen starts over DJ?

23728,2020-12-19 01:52:59,kfwxkb,Pain
23729,2020-12-19 01:53:26,kfwxkb,"Soo fluid KD, simply amazing"
23730,2020-12-19 01:54:31,kfwxkb,God I really hope KD doesn’t overdo it and re-injure that ankle.

23732,2020-12-19 01:58:56,kfwxkb,Afro tatum <<<<

23735,2020-12-19 02:02:36,kfwxkb,"Ainge clearly planning to tank this season, wants to hoard more draft picks."
23736,2020-12-19 02:02:46,kfwxkb,I wanted the Nets to draft Nesmith
23737,2020-12-19 02:04:05,kfwxkb,"If I took a shot for everytime this man said ""deadeye shooter""..."
23738,2020-12-19 02:18:22,kfwxkb,Think I have time to make some pizza rolls?
23739,2020-12-19 02:22:07,kfwxkb,Cavs are getting massacred right now

23742,2020-12-19 02:26:28,kfwxkb,2 defenisve possessions in 2nd half - jordan foul and jordan leaving a man wide open under the rim
23743,2020-12-19 02:27:53,kfwxkb,Fuck. Blow it alllllll up.
23744,2020-12-19 02:29:27,kfwxkb,"Just hopped to the game, how's KD & Kyrie looking?"
23745,2020-12-19 02:29:48,kfwxkb,Great pass from KD
23746,2020-12-19 02:30:21,kfwxkb,What are these no calls going both ways lol
23747,2020-12-19 02:30:46,kfwxkb,lmao Theis
23748,2020-12-19 02:31:43,kfwxkb,With the rest of our squad I forgot we have kyrie.
23749,2020-12-19 02:42:20,kfwxkb,How does Goat 7 look?
23750,2020-12-19 02:51:49,kfwxkb,How Tatum plus?????
23751,2020-12-19 03:11:33,kfwxkb,These two are painfully white.
23752,2020-12-19 00:19:53,kfwxkb,Mmm yeah i can’t wait till the Celtics bench gets obliterated
23753,2020-12-19 01:35:21,kfwxkb,Tatum might be 6'10 now but he damn sure ain't no KD believe dat!
23754,2020-12-19 02:42:27,kfwxkb,Celtics are gonna be cheeks this year ngl
23755,2020-12-19 01:26:40,kfwxkb,Celtics are clearly outmatched.
23756,2020-12-19 02:01:11,kfwxkb,Should the Celtics tank?
23757,2020-12-19 00:00:56,kfwxkb,"Why the hell are there so many good games tonight, complete ass juice games tomorrow and then no games at all for 2 days??"
23758,2020-12-19 01:06:21,kfwxkb,I'm struggling with my desire to root for KD while rooting against Kyrie.
23759,2020-12-19 01:17:22,kfwxkb,Who in the East is stopping KD?
23760,2020-12-19 01:28:12,kfwxkb,oh shit we cooking cooking
23761,2020-12-19 01:56:52,kfwxkb,"Lets all over react

Celtics 4th seed?!!!?👀👀👀"
23762,2020-12-19 02:00:16,kfwxkb,Marcus not smart
23763,2020-12-19 02:02:03,kfwxkb,THT for Tatum disregard the contracts says no who
23764,2020-12-19 02:09:59,kfwxkb,"KD and Bron just need to shave their heads, they look fucking ridiculous"
23765,2020-12-19 02:15:08,kfwxkb,How many of you nets fans are from jersey or Brooklyn lol
23766,2020-12-19 02:26:06,kfwxkb,  I keep thinking that’s 2chainz out there lmao
23767,2020-12-19 02:26:44,kfwxkb,Do the Nets have an unfair advantage due to Kyries witchcraft?
23768,2020-12-19 02:31:15,kfwxkb,"feels like this is a 25pt blowout, but the celtics are actually just 2-3 good possessions in a row from being right there"
23769,2020-12-19 02:32:35,kfwxkb,rookie spida commercial <3
23770,2020-12-19 02:46:25,kfwxkb,"Nash: ""our offense is part art, part science.""

Someone is hanging around Kyrie too much."
23771,2020-12-19 02:55:50,kfwxkb,"Nets fans, do you think having carris and Spencer are redundant? Would you trade one of them or both for a 3 and d guy?"
23772,2020-12-19 01:05:03,kfwxkb,Give me a healthy KD over Tatum/Brown combined.
23773,2020-12-19 02:00:00,kfwxkb,[deleted]
23774,2020-12-19 02:00:13,kfwxkb,Will Celtics have a .500 season?
23775,2020-12-19 02:39:23,kfwxkb,"Is it just me or does Tatum look worse with his new 6'10 height?

His mechanics look off now that he has a extra 2 inches on his body his handle looks off because he so used to bouncing the ball a certain height when he was 6'8.

I think he made a mistake growing that extra 2 inches. He should shrink back down to his old height imo."
23776,2020-12-19 01:57:22,kfwxkb,Celtics are no longer contenders
23777,2020-12-19 01:58:07,kfwxkb,Tatum has been the exactly same player since he was a rookie
23778,2020-12-19 01:46:28,kfwxkb,Honestly I don’t see what Celtics fans see in Theis.
23779,2020-12-19 02:10:46,kfwxkb,[deleted]
23780,2020-12-19 02:58:41,kfwxkb,bucks still winning the east
23781,2020-12-19 01:21:31,kfwxkb,"Do people realize KD is not even close to full form yet?

Scary sight!"
23782,2020-12-19 01:04:08,kfwxkb,Nets should come out of the east. KD>Giannis and Irving>jrue? Kris?!! Lmao 😂
23783,2020-12-19 01:15:19,kfwxkb,Smart is **not** a playmaker.
23784,2020-12-19 01:23:20,kfwxkb,Ref looking good
23785,2020-12-19 01:52:56,kfwxkb,Will the Celtics even make the second round this year?
23786,2020-12-19 01:53:01,kfwxkb,Imagine believing that Kawhi is better than KD.
23787,2020-12-19 01:54:29,kfwxkb,floppin ass smart
23788,2020-12-19 01:57:39,kfwxkb,Bruh this dude CC needs to stop mumbling wtf is he saying
23789,2020-12-19 01:48:27,kfwxkb,[deleted]
23790,2020-12-19 01:47:33,kfwxkb,You think Durant and Irving believe masks work?
23791,2020-12-19 01:25:43,kfwxkb,"Man this ain't fair. Brooklyn doesn't even have KD at full force yet and they already dominating the Celtics.

I don't see any threats to the Nets this year. We severely underrated the impact of KD."
23792,2020-12-19 01:35:49,kfwxkb,Omfg this commentating crew might be the worst I've ever heard. Jesus Christ this is what we have to put up with if we want to watch KD
23793,2020-12-19 00:54:19,kfwxkb,Do Nets fans think Kyrie is as mental as I do?
23794,2020-12-19 01:25:17,kfwxkb,This will not be a good season for us
23795,2020-12-19 01:12:43,kfwxkb,Durant and Kyrie are cooked.  Book it!
23796,2020-12-19 01:06:25,kfwxkb,"KD back in the NBA let that sink in...

The only man who can truly go toe to toe with LeBron.

Nets got East on 🔒 this year no 🧢!"
23797,2020-12-19 01:32:50,kfwxkb,"This is why I watch the Celtics feed, Abby Chin openly discussing Kyrie ducking Boston lmao"
23798,2020-12-19 01:29:15,kfwxkb,"My goodness throw in the towel!

Brooklyn vs LA is clearly headed for a collision course. 2 dominate teams in the 2 biggest markets gotta love the storylines.

Tupac vs Biggie type shit! Sheesh!"
23799,2020-12-19 02:06:36,kfwxkb,KD is deferring to kyire too much. I don't see this relationship working.
23800,2020-12-19 01:04:33,kfwxkb,"/r/nba:  hates and/or mocks us

We Brooklyn Nets fans:  https://youtu.be/EDErWuTRluI"
23801,2020-12-19 01:00:16,kfwxkb,Welcome to the club. 😎
23802,2020-12-19 02:58:49,kfwxkb,I'm glad they are... KD is such a fun player to watch
23803,2020-12-19 16:44:33,kfwxkb,"Nah, I'm all for it. Why can't people just enjoy the goddamn parity and the talent level todays league has? There is like 24 playoff teams and like 10 legit contenders in both conferences."
23804,2020-12-19 00:15:27,kfwxkb,Laker fans ready?
23805,2020-12-19 00:14:27,kfwxkb,I’m here to make sure of that
23806,2020-12-19 00:29:48,kfwxkb,Are you saying the sage won't work?
23807,2020-12-19 01:35:11,kfwxkb,"Well, yeah...us fans need to shake off the rust too if we want to be making hot takes at a high efficiency rate when it matters"
23808,2020-12-19 01:35:59,kfwxkb,So are regular season threads lol
23809,2020-12-19 01:38:14,kfwxkb,That's the price of having KD and Kyrie on your team. If you win so much salt will flow. If you lose...may god have mercy on your soul.
23810,2020-12-19 02:50:16,kfwxkb,lmao
23811,2020-12-19 03:10:14,kfwxkb,I’d take Harden
23812,2020-12-19 02:55:51,kfwxkb,Their second unit made the playoffs last year lol
23813,2020-12-19 02:57:17,kfwxkb,"we have 4 of our last seasons starters off the bench+shamet and Jeff Green, its insane"
23814,2020-12-19 02:57:11,kfwxkb,they're at least with the bucks. the bucks did win 70 games last year (basically)
23815,2020-12-19 02:09:48,kfwxkb,"Oh, look out for the bandwagon."
23816,2020-12-19 02:52:37,kfwxkb,"That's what r/NBA would like you to think. It's because they don't want us to get Harden and become a superteam, so they try downplaying our assets"
23817,2020-12-19 00:17:01,kfwxkb,I feel it in my plums
23818,2020-12-19 02:09:44,kfwxkb,"hes an exceptional basketball player, one of the greatest of all time. he is good at everything on the court, the scoring is just what makes the headlines since hes the most gifted scorer ever probably."
23819,2020-12-19 02:09:26,kfwxkb,"It’s insane, I was assuming he’d have the ball in his hands every possession but he is so comfortable going a minute or two without taking a shot or driving to the basket"
23820,2020-12-19 02:08:56,kfwxkb,just wait
23821,2020-12-19 02:55:12,kfwxkb,He did it against Washington too so 2-0
23822,2020-12-19 02:54:01,kfwxkb,Phil Jackson knew what he was doing
23823,2020-12-19 03:55:10,kfwxkb,"Welcome! Sign here please and devote your life to r/gonets 

_________"
23824,2020-12-19 03:07:07,kfwxkb,"He's the exception to everything lol, a lanky tall guy, who actually has great handles like a guard and scoring abilities like a built figure."
23825,2020-12-19 03:24:40,kfwxkb,Kyrie did what all spiritual peoples do remove negativity. Watch the dead files
23826,2020-12-19 01:29:41,kfwxkb,"Yeah, we are definitely gonna go small to close out games."
23827,2020-12-19 01:29:42,kfwxkb,Yup.
23828,2020-12-19 01:39:38,kfwxkb,"> The Nets will play KD at C to close out games anyways

nah I don't think we're gonna do that"
23829,2020-12-19 01:51:02,kfwxkb,Link
23830,2020-12-19 01:51:15,kfwxkb,Not enough info
23831,2020-12-19 02:35:37,kfwxkb,He has great offensive iq all together. Will be great for them.
23832,2020-12-19 02:34:40,kfwxkb,"Fr he’s been looking really good, we saw that he can have moments in the playoffs where he isn’t a bad defender, now we’re seeing that in a preseason game."
23833,2020-12-19 03:00:39,kfwxkb,Jarret Allen lol
23834,2020-12-19 01:16:08,kfwxkb,So bad bruh it hurts
23835,2020-12-19 02:40:34,kfwxkb,"hes not even rusty, hes just in 3rd gear"
23836,2020-12-19 02:55:04,kfwxkb,"Kyrie, John Wall and Boogie is a weird fit"
23837,2020-12-19 03:15:55,kfwxkb,lol what picks he used them all
23838,2020-12-19 01:58:14,kfwxkb,Feels good
23839,2020-12-19 01:48:12,kfwxkb,untucked jersey kyrie + arm band kyrie + sage burning kyrie = best player in the league.
23840,2020-12-19 01:52:46,kfwxkb,but you got a trade exception
23841,2020-12-19 02:49:33,kfwxkb,Lol
23842,2020-12-19 02:52:50,kfwxkb,Smiles
23843,2020-12-19 03:02:23,kfwxkb,People have been saying that for ages
23844,2020-12-19 03:07:44,kfwxkb,I always felt he looked like Trae Young
23845,2020-12-19 00:41:49,kfwxkb,Ima be chilling in both
23846,2020-12-19 01:00:50,kfwxkb,They showing that on tv?

23848,2020-12-19 01:09:40,kfwxkb,Bro someone’s gotta get a clip of that. Came here to see if I was the only one who heard it lol
23849,2020-12-19 01:20:41,kfwxkb,Hands off!
23850,2020-12-19 01:20:00,kfwxkb,"100 bucks says that deandres gonna cause locker room issues if he’s benches, so they’re hesitant"
23851,2020-12-19 01:23:45,kfwxkb,"Sloppy is part of Brooklyn Nets culture at this point

Jake Johnson would play the Nets in a movie"
23852,2020-12-19 01:24:51,kfwxkb,Probably not
23853,2020-12-19 01:28:48,kfwxkb,Literally just hit puberty. 13 years old. So much potential.

23856,2020-12-19 01:49:13,kfwxkb,"Doctors told KD he would be 90-95% this season, and the 500 days of rest was clearly beneficial for KD. Some players rush back from their injuries.

KD should be fine."
23857,2020-12-19 01:36:53,kfwxkb,No
23858,2020-12-19 01:37:01,kfwxkb,no his first time

23865,2020-12-19 02:11:51,kfwxkb,"Is this you @ing Knicks Front Office? 

Tbh I am guessing there's been advances in medicine and recovery for torn Achilles. Also, KD had over a year and a half to work on it and Nets are careful like that."
23866,2020-12-19 02:52:47,kfwxkb,The 76ers
23867,2020-12-19 03:02:19,kfwxkb,He's fine.
23868,2020-12-19 03:01:55,kfwxkb,Brad is a top 5 coach so he’s fine

23872,2020-12-19 02:42:56,kfwxkb,I’ll wait till it counts
23873,2020-12-19 02:40:56,kfwxkb,lets remember it is 1 preseason game

23875,2020-12-19 01:24:12,kfwxkb,Dude I almost can’t watch. Insane amount of anxiety
23876,2020-12-19 01:34:50,kfwxkb,"I dont mind the younger player paying his dues by coming off the bench for the more accomplished player.  Jordan was all NBA and all defense for gods sake, not some scrub. And honestly last year the difference between the two wasnt as great as some people make it out to be. If Allen dominates Jordan in training he will eventually get the start as he should. But if he has to back up Jordan for half a year he'll live."
23877,2020-12-19 01:39:15,kfwxkb,You forgot brown
23878,2020-12-19 01:49:13,kfwxkb,He’s always had them

23882,2020-12-19 02:00:48,kfwxkb,He should shave just the top and rock the monk cut.
23883,2020-12-19 02:02:01,kfwxkb,not that hard of a fix you can spray some shit to fill out a bald spot like that. Not a lebron situation
23884,2020-12-19 02:13:18,kfwxkb,Fr this is great
23885,2020-12-19 02:15:05,kfwxkb,i need joe ingles mic'd up every game

23888,2020-12-19 02:20:13,kfwxkb,This should always be the halftime show
23889,2020-12-19 02:51:38,kfwxkb,"im genuinely asking, what is the narrative on achilles?

i was always under the impression that that narrative was that its a career ender (more or less)"

23901,2020-12-19 03:14:05,kfwxkb,KD back
23902,2020-12-19 03:10:58,kfwxkb,We got fucked
23903,2020-12-19 03:19:07,kfwxkb,Yes! Gives me serious Kerr vibes.
23904,2020-12-19 03:22:14,kfwxkb,"Imagine being so confident after a preseason game. Yeah, it's still a tentative offer to me..."
23905,2020-12-19 03:11:10,kfwxkb,You have too much free time lol
23906,2020-12-19 01:20:52,kfwxkb,He was chucking in the playoffs too. Why does Brad let him hijack the offense?
23907,2020-12-19 01:51:56,kfwxkb,Danny Ainge roster management
23908,2020-12-19 02:11:28,kfwxkb,"I mean, they did screw them for a good while, and the Celtics have been pretty good the last few years.  Title is always a question, and picking up two top-20 FAs will flip any team.  Look at where the Lakers would be if they hadn't signed Lebron."
23909,2020-12-19 02:23:48,kfwxkb,This comment makes it seem like it was a 4D move. The trade was shocking and as a Nets fan we’ve endured some shitty basketball to get here. We were saved by Marks and free agency for two future hall of famers. The Celtics have two stars under 26 gifted to them by our fuck ups. Reminder that this comment looks 4D stupid if this team doesn’t go far.
23910,2020-12-19 16:47:04,kfwxkb,"If Tatum and Brown don't jump another level soon, I'm gonna have Center Durant nightmares forever."
23911,2020-12-19 01:10:25,kfwxkb,Agreed... it's not over the top but just as effective
23912,2020-12-19 01:15:27,kfwxkb,Big if true
23913,2020-12-19 01:19:05,kfwxkb,Its a god damn nightmare and I demand to know who is responsible
23914,2020-12-19 01:19:31,kfwxkb,big ones
23915,2020-12-19 01:20:04,kfwxkb,Didn’t notice but my guess is Aunt Pearl’s
23916,2020-12-19 01:26:27,kfwxkb,KD13 Aunt Pearl
23917,2020-12-19 01:27:39,kfwxkb,Not at all. It was originally thought that Caris would be the one to start over Dinwiddie but Nash is trying different stuff before the season ig
23918,2020-12-19 01:28:50,kfwxkb,Bitcoin is also 23k now.
23919,2020-12-19 01:31:36,kfwxkb,"I think we're gonna try and spread them out and beat them with shooting. Will work better against the sixers of course, no idea how we handle giannis."
23920,2020-12-19 01:31:24,kfwxkb,Nash will come off the bench if needed
23921,2020-12-19 01:47:41,kfwxkb,He definitely gets tapers once a week.
23922,2020-12-19 01:50:43,kfwxkb,Same for the celtics too.
23923,2020-12-19 01:52:51,kfwxkb,yo for real i was hyped to get brown but i guess our roster so deep at guard he odd man out.
23924,2020-12-19 01:56:13,kfwxkb,I like fully erect teams
23925,2020-12-19 01:56:00,kfwxkb,He’s only 30 lmao. 1 and done in 2010

23927,2020-12-19 02:22:38,kfwxkb,"i had my first one ever today since i was curious. not very good. its fine, it'll make a turd, but the chicken at mcdonalds is better, and mcdonalds had some shitty chicken"
23928,2020-12-19 02:34:25,kfwxkb,It has no texture and slathered in sauce.  So no it's not good.
23929,2020-12-19 02:22:18,kfwxkb,Overrated IMO
23930,2020-12-19 02:23:58,kfwxkb,"No, they just make sure to wait until everyone forgets they're gross and hype another return.

That being said, I could eat McDonald's cheeseburgers every day and be happy, so my palate isn't exactly refined"
23931,2020-12-19 02:32:38,kfwxkb,"I mean it's preseason, he isn't going 100%"
23932,2020-12-19 02:33:13,kfwxkb,"Maybe a tad bit, but not too hesitant for his 2nd game in like 550 days."
23933,2020-12-19 02:43:06,kfwxkb,But he’s not
23934,2020-12-19 01:53:51,kfwxkb,Consider this a warning ⚠️
23935,2020-12-19 01:54:24,kfwxkb,So yall already creating a narrative of poor me? Doubters of a guy coming off an achilles? Calm down.
23936,2020-12-19 00:02:54,kfwxkb,no way the celtics make it to the ecf
23937,2020-12-19 01:29:42,kfwxkb,"But putting Levert & Allen as 2nd unit, guys we had success with as starters, I like the depth it provides I admit"
23938,2020-12-19 01:28:10,kfwxkb,The price we must pay for Kevin Durant
23939,2020-12-19 01:36:06,kfwxkb,It wasnt last year.
23940,2020-12-19 01:59:56,kfwxkb,Sounds like a fun series though...
23941,2020-12-19 02:00:15,kfwxkb,kyrie destroys jrue.
23942,2020-12-19 01:59:50,kfwxkb,"You’re not wrong. We have great depth, though."
23943,2020-12-19 01:59:02,kfwxkb,Are the bucks still deep though?
23944,2020-12-19 02:05:04,kfwxkb,You should check out our subreddit. Did you know we're not a playoff team?
23945,2020-12-19 02:53:33,kfwxkb,We know who he is
23946,2020-12-19 04:32:50,kfwxkb,"Lol. Yeah KD really has that ""Y'all forgot who I am, didn't you?"" attitude. Sheesh. I've never seen someone score a zillion point and never seem to break a sweat like KD."
23947,2020-12-19 01:09:24,kfwxkb,Not to milkmen
23948,2020-12-19 02:37:45,kfwxkb,"It was his decision, not ours"
23949,2020-12-19 02:43:40,kfwxkb,Surprise rebuild
23950,2020-12-19 02:52:04,kfwxkb,Only 2 preseason games so this was a dress rehearsal for us
23951,2020-12-19 02:35:30,kfwxkb,It's not just that.
23952,2020-12-19 00:49:50,kfwxkb,Is Harden going there?
23953,2020-12-19 01:04:48,kfwxkb,Aka the Celtic fans
23954,2020-12-19 01:10:58,kfwxkb,Used to love their cheese tots. I agree. Their food is pretty trash.
23955,2020-12-19 01:19:17,kfwxkb,big ones
23956,2020-12-19 01:26:49,kfwxkb,KD13 Aunt Pearl
23957,2020-12-19 01:17:05,kfwxkb,Kds
23958,2020-12-19 01:17:33,kfwxkb,He's a top-3 player in the league fully healthy.  It happens.
23959,2020-12-19 01:17:44,kfwxkb,Pretty sure he doesnt? Has to be Giannis or lebron.  Kd is a great finisher though. Maybe because he takes way less shots at the rim than them?
23960,2020-12-19 01:19:26,kfwxkb,It wasn't a brick tho.
23961,2020-12-19 01:19:53,kfwxkb,what did you get back?
23962,2020-12-19 01:21:29,kfwxkb,Deandre Jordan just stares at the ball cuz he’s too lazy to bend over and pick it up
23963,2020-12-19 01:27:57,kfwxkb,He’s got no conscience offensively. Still a plus no matter what.
23964,2020-12-19 01:25:15,kfwxkb,is it weird that I would watch that?
23965,2020-12-19 01:31:15,kfwxkb,"Yes, Allen will play more minutes though and probably touch the ball more off the bench."
23966,2020-12-19 01:40:52,kfwxkb,"JA will start eventually, he’s going to be so much more effective it’ll be impossible to ignore eventually. DAJ is serviceable but washed compared to his peak"
23967,2020-12-19 01:46:21,kfwxkb,"A little after the major free agent signings, around when TT signed."
23968,2020-12-19 01:55:26,kfwxkb,Joy
23969,2020-12-19 02:36:12,kfwxkb,"Cleveland wasted 10 years of Lebron, all due to his loyalty to the City, and then the peoples had the nerve to burn his jersey after the front office failed him. Hopefully  it's not the same with  Giannis  he said, he didn't want fans to burn his jersey"
23970,2020-12-19 02:27:05,kfwxkb,third - stands still watching a competent shooter shoot a 3
23971,2020-12-19 02:33:11,kfwxkb,They’re looking like the best duo in the East
23972,2020-12-19 02:33:33,kfwxkb,"KD looks like he’s taking it easy, which is to be expected. Kyrie looks great though"
23973,2020-12-19 02:43:04,kfwxkb,Tatum just needs to shave his hair again we’ll be fine
23974,2020-12-19 02:02:29,kfwxkb,What do you want for Jaylen Brown?  We're tearing this b down.
23975,2020-12-19 00:01:38,kfwxkb,It's just the preseason lol
23976,2020-12-19 00:16:39,kfwxkb,"Friday, nfl Saturday canelo fight Saturday ncaa championship games ... saaaaturday"
23977,2020-12-19 00:44:57,kfwxkb,Theres no games after Saturday because the season starts on Tuesday.....
23978,2020-12-19 01:19:10,kfwxkb,Stay healthy and no one beats him.
23979,2020-12-19 02:00:10,kfwxkb,Are the Celtics gonna make the playoffs???????
23980,2020-12-19 02:02:54,kfwxkb,Lakers
23981,2020-12-19 02:13:44,kfwxkb,Bring back the monk cut you cowards!
23982,2020-12-19 02:16:02,kfwxkb,Jersey born Net fan checking in!
23983,2020-12-19 02:17:44,kfwxkb,"Brooklyn, myself.  I became an NBA fan when the move back to NY was announced, because they were building Barclays so close to wear I lived at the time.  Ended up going to like 30 games that inaugural BKN year because they were dirt cheap (as low as $6 on stubhub 10 min before tip off back then) so I accidentally turned into a basketball fan when I meant it to be a casual diversion."
23984,2020-12-19 02:18:14,kfwxkb,Since 02-03 NJ.
23985,2020-12-19 02:24:46,kfwxkb,Brooklyn represent
23986,2020-12-19 02:40:47,kfwxkb,Jersey nets fan from Newark
23987,2020-12-19 02:29:14,kfwxkb,Careful or he'll summon a swamp dragon
23988,2020-12-19 02:56:31,kfwxkb,Definitely dinwiddie but he's huge insurance if kyrie gets injured
23989,2020-12-19 02:57:54,kfwxkb,My mind is saying yes but my heart says no 😖
23990,2020-12-19 03:09:55,kfwxkb,"Unfortunately I do. We only need one 6th man and if you can have someone like Levert play that role it takes a ton of pressure of the starters. 

That being said, I can guarantee that dinwiddie will single handily win us a few games this year and he is an amazing insurance policy in case Kyrie gets hurt."
23991,2020-12-19 02:59:21,kfwxkb,"If one of them gets traded, it’s Spencer. He’s in a contract year. Nets fans most cliche trade machine trade has been Dinwiddie for Aaron Gordon these past few yrs"
23992,2020-12-19 02:59:47,kfwxkb,Not redundant but I'd trade din because his contract is up this season and we dont need to pay 20mill to another guard
23993,2020-12-19 01:08:39,kfwxkb,Well yeah healthy KD is a top 15 player ever lmao
23994,2020-12-19 01:11:36,kfwxkb,Yes.
23995,2020-12-19 02:00:57,kfwxkb,This isn't your fathers' Nets.
23996,2020-12-19 02:00:58,kfwxkb,I sense that this comment would be a good one to save
23997,2020-12-19 02:03:20,kfwxkb,Bruh you know that’s a stupid take lmao
23998,2020-12-19 02:00:25,kfwxkb,"Except he now runs pick and rolls, shoots from the dribble and makes plays for others."
23999,2020-12-19 01:58:32,kfwxkb,Ben Simmons special
24000,2020-12-19 01:58:45,kfwxkb,Higher usuage tho
24001,2020-12-19 01:47:07,kfwxkb,He was pretty great for them last year
24002,2020-12-19 01:47:43,kfwxkb,"do celtics fans really rate him? hes big and strong and serviceable, i think thats the consensus"
24003,2020-12-19 01:48:09,kfwxkb,Aside from being a solid player?
24004,2020-12-19 02:20:59,kfwxkb,I like this timeline
24005,2020-12-19 03:00:02,kfwxkb,wtf i thought we were cool with sun fans
24006,2020-12-19 03:02:24,kfwxkb,Don’t be so sure!
24007,2020-12-19 01:54:30,kfwxkb,It’s official
24008,2020-12-19 01:49:48,kfwxkb,"Y’all wish, you’ll take Tyler Herro & you’ll like it"
24009,2020-12-19 01:50:54,kfwxkb,They should trade for harden tbh. Brown smart and picks
24010,2020-12-19 01:50:38,kfwxkb,"Totally. Sell high. He’s a good player, but he’s basically Demar Derozan. Go find a Kawhi."
24011,2020-12-19 01:48:24,kfwxkb,"Kyrie donated 500,000 masks so I’m pretty sure that he does"
24012,2020-12-19 01:48:21,kfwxkb,Yes

24014,2020-12-19 01:36:37,kfwxkb,we usually get ian eagle and richard jefferson
24015,2020-12-19 01:37:11,kfwxkb,"You watching on YES?

If so, we normally have the best, but this is CCs first game ever.

Usually we have Ian eagle and sometimes Richard Jefferson."
24016,2020-12-19 01:39:53,kfwxkb,"i literally posted the opposite a couple minutes ago

i thought cc was pretty fluid with his thoughts and interesting to listen to

did you want someone to call every dribble in the 1st quarter of a preseason game? stories and insight are way more interesting"
24017,2020-12-19 01:00:28,kfwxkb,"No, he's different that's all. I was a art major in college, and he acts no different than any of them or anyone in that field. It makes sense now why he refers to himself as an artist now. Lol"
24018,2020-12-19 01:10:52,kfwxkb,you haven’t realized that people can be in to different things?
24019,2020-12-19 00:59:53,kfwxkb,Burning sage.
24020,2020-12-19 01:03:37,kfwxkb,"Who cares nobody is beating the Nets in the East this year. KD is clearly the best player in the conference now.

All that talk about Jaylen Tatum growing to 6'10. Bro KD 7ft ain't shit stopping that man."
24021,2020-12-19 01:26:28,kfwxkb,THE SKY IS FALLING.
24022,2020-12-19 01:28:09,kfwxkb,Ainge cursed you guys when he traded IT
24023,2020-12-19 01:13:26,kfwxkb,huh?
24024,2020-12-19 01:38:06,kfwxkb,"Yeah, being injured just like he was for 60 other games is totally ducking Boston. Man slammed his shoulder in a car door so he didmt have to face some racists in Boston"
24025,2020-12-19 01:31:14,kfwxkb,It’s preseason
24026,2020-12-19 02:16:30,kfwxkb,It’s literally all laughs and smiles between Kyrie and KD lmao. Lads get along just well and are great friends. They’ll be scoring at a similar rate and take about the same amount of shots. Just like LeBron and Kyrie did.
24027,2020-12-19 03:06:48,kfwxkb,Shows you how much the NBA missed KD & Steph better appreciate them now.
24028,2020-12-19 03:07:31,kfwxkb,It’s kinda nice to see everyone root for KD again. I think even KD knows why his move to the warriors brought so much hate. The dude is not only one of the most gifted ballers to ever play the game but also just loves playing basketball. Like you can tell he’s at his happiest when he’s on the court.
24029,2020-12-19 00:17:58,kfwxkb,To instigate? Yes.
24030,2020-12-19 00:18:59,kfwxkb,THT 🥰
24031,2020-12-19 00:34:58,kfwxkb,We over rode it with crack cocaine

24034,2020-12-19 16:42:42,kfwxkb,Who wouldn't
24035,2020-12-19 03:19:11,kfwxkb,Tbf I don’t really want to get Harden and become a super team either. I’d love to see at least a season with this squad. The depth is insane and gives us a legit shot. I’m also skeptical about the Harden chemistry. I know it’s early but this crew’s looking pretty locked in
24036,2020-12-19 02:18:22,kfwxkb,He's played his entire career either with Westbrook or on the stacked Warriors.  He definitely doesn't need the ball in his hands.
24037,2020-12-19 02:13:37,kfwxkb,It's been 6 quarters in the pre season
24038,2020-12-19 02:10:34,kfwxkb,Lmao
24039,2020-12-19 02:19:33,kfwxkb,He had a low time of possession even on golden state compared to bother stars

24041,2020-12-19 02:41:49,kfwxkb,"Yeah, he's not pushing too hard. Surprised he dunked that last one."
24042,2020-12-19 03:17:43,kfwxkb,"Exactly, now we’re stuck with a bunch of rooks who aren’t going to help us win a championship"
24043,2020-12-19 02:50:30,kfwxkb,Lakers gonna be the only ones that can hang with us bro. You know it's true
24044,2020-12-19 01:31:27,kfwxkb,Prince is better off the bench too. Add in Shamet and Green too.. That’s a solid 2nd unit
24045,2020-12-19 01:50:00,kfwxkb,Because they hate him. Come on now lol
24046,2020-12-19 01:49:51,kfwxkb,It’s Kyrie
24047,2020-12-19 02:04:13,kfwxkb,"Despite him never breaking the law, lives a quiet life and donates his money to help the needy . People look for excuses to hate Kyrie."
24048,2020-12-19 01:54:17,kfwxkb,Heard he's been working on his lateral agility.  Watch out.
24049,2020-12-19 01:52:48,kfwxkb,It was a joke.
24050,2020-12-19 01:54:40,kfwxkb,That's a dumb cover story cause it makes them look like fucking morons
24051,2020-12-19 02:55:07,kfwxkb,Nope
24052,2020-12-19 16:49:18,kfwxkb,"Sorry bud, if they keep playing the way they're playing they should just change the name of the conference to the Nets.

This was a joke btw"
24053,2020-12-19 03:02:19,kfwxkb,"Ya that was my thought too, just wanted to hear some takes from Celtics fans"
24054,2020-12-19 18:15:33,kfwxkb,Idk. I think top 5 spots are reserved for champions
24055,2020-12-19 03:08:37,kfwxkb,"TT still about to make his debut but I doubt he makes too much difference. Ainge fucked up with the way he constructed this roster. Your team is looking great though, I have y’all over the Bucks as favorites in the East."
24056,2020-12-19 02:43:43,kfwxkb,"Thank you for clarifying! Actually I had no idea it was preseason.

 If KD and Kyrie were looking like shit this sub would be furiously masturbating so yea don't care, thank you"
24057,2020-12-19 02:44:19,kfwxkb,"We know, but after years of our game threads having tons of Celtics fans cheering for us to lose straight into Celtics fans shitting on us for kyrie, a game like this feels pretty good, even if it’s just preseason"
24058,2020-12-19 02:41:49,kfwxkb,whats with all the negative jazz fans in here?
24059,2020-12-19 02:52:45,kfwxkb,"Generally speaking, yeah.  Not necessarily an ender, but that you never come back the same.  But, if two dudes around 30 both come back, and Klay does, too, it might be time to reassess."
24060,2020-12-19 00:16:08,kfwxkb,"Kemba Walker would go 7/19 for 22 points, give up a bunch of easy baskets and call it a day"
24061,2020-12-19 00:42:55,kfwxkb,Who?
24062,2020-12-19 02:46:29,kfwxkb,Sorry y'all not gonna get the Denver Nuggets and the east 5 seed this year. You gotta face a real contender to win the chip this season
24063,2020-12-19 03:14:26,kfwxkb,Hope it becomes his pre-game routine now lmao. Winds up people as well which is another plus.
24064,2020-12-19 03:31:53,kfwxkb,"its not that im this confident in the nets. its more about realizing the circumstances by some fans. their fanbase needs methodical approach in this matter, not this emotional bullshit. the rockets began to blow their team up even before this discussion began. harden loses trade value with every day that passes by. rockets had no leverage and certainly they dont have it now. 
and then its also severely underrating levert and dinwiddie.
in this circumstances to call for these players and at least 6 picks/swaps is insane. rockets will end up with far less"
24065,2020-12-19 02:21:59,kfwxkb,I still think y’all scared away the big fish FAs when Ainge traded IT. If you guys got AD I think you would’ve had a title by now.
24066,2020-12-19 01:33:32,kfwxkb,You don’t just handle the others
24067,2020-12-19 01:44:04,kfwxkb,Can anyone handle Giannis?
24068,2020-12-19 02:08:09,kfwxkb,Why the hell we play 4 😒
24069,2020-12-19 01:53:30,kfwxkb,He should play over Tyler Johnson and chiozza
24070,2020-12-19 02:22:39,kfwxkb,I want to try the mcfish
24071,2020-12-19 01:56:19,kfwxkb,type beat

24073,2020-12-19 02:06:21,kfwxkb,"Yeah, I avoid that place for a reason."
24074,2020-12-19 01:22:21,kfwxkb,"I could comfortably paddle up a stream in one of them, whistling a jaunty tune..."
24075,2020-12-19 01:30:25,kfwxkb,Thank you!
24076,2020-12-19 01:19:29,kfwxkb,"Well duh, lol.  My bad...I keep forgetting we got guys with their own shoes besides Dinwiddie now..."
24077,2020-12-19 01:18:27,kfwxkb,"He did on golden state, just on much lower volume than lebron and giannis."
24078,2020-12-19 02:03:48,kfwxkb,Cp3 and John Collins. I think long term I should be fine consider KD will likely load manage.. but the potential man
24079,2020-12-19 01:42:12,kfwxkb,I also don’t see the issue with him and LeVert playing major minutes on the second team. They could do some serious damage
24080,2020-12-19 01:42:42,kfwxkb,Right. He’s not a bad option to bring off the bench at all but that should be Allen’s spot
24081,2020-12-19 02:27:29,kfwxkb,wow this guy is a meme
24082,2020-12-19 02:03:15,kfwxkb,Best we can do is Kostas
24083,2020-12-19 02:06:31,kfwxkb,Cash considerations and a year of Kyle Kuzmas Fans only page
24084,2020-12-19 00:31:12,kfwxkb,This is a good weekend
24085,2020-12-19 01:20:36,kfwxkb,Facts!
24086,2020-12-19 02:16:53,kfwxkb,Get ready for your room to be filled with wagoners lol
24087,2020-12-19 02:18:56,kfwxkb,"I live in Manhattan, it’s wild how expensive the knicks games were compared to BKN.

FWIW, I’m from They bay."
24088,2020-12-19 02:15:47,kfwxkb,"Which is my nets since I’m a father. Daughter is 8, average age on r/nba members do I approve of this comment."
24089,2020-12-19 02:04:28,kfwxkb,"How will they beat the nets bucks ? Raptors maybe, 76ers have something to prove"
24090,2020-12-19 03:00:54,kfwxkb,Yeah I thought Steve Nash was the peace treaty
24091,2020-12-19 03:02:47,kfwxkb,House SuNets is no more!
24092,2020-12-19 01:52:04,kfwxkb,If they take Herro that means a Harden-Butler-Bam trio is running the east and the Celtics won’t get to the Finals anytime soon
24093,2020-12-19 02:02:20,kfwxkb,A Demar that shoots 38% from 3 & plays good defense sounds pretty good to me
24094,2020-12-19 01:27:25,kfwxkb,Bruh ain't nobody stopping KD chill out.
24095,2020-12-19 01:39:14,kfwxkb,"Ignore that thing; check it's post history, it's a regular troll looking for attention."
24096,2020-12-19 01:39:38,kfwxkb,"Ignore that thing; check it's post history, it's a regular troll looking for attention."
24097,2020-12-19 01:01:26,kfwxkb,"When I saw that his painting are sitting on the floor and not hanging on the walls, I questioned everything I ever knew about him."
24098,2020-12-19 01:01:34,kfwxkb,"he’s a member of the Lakota tribe, and burning sage to drive off wicked/negative spirits is traditional in their culture. do some fucking research and don’t just be ignorant because you may think he’s weird"
24099,2020-12-19 01:05:01,kfwxkb,"Idk, $50 on the Nets crumbling by All Star weekend"
24100,2020-12-19 01:15:47,kfwxkb,I'm just messing around.
24101,2020-12-19 01:44:13,kfwxkb,lol you know he's not playing today if there's fans
24102,2020-12-19 01:33:06,kfwxkb,"Bruh who stopping KD in the East?

Nets have depth that is the scary part."

24104,2020-12-19 01:39:46,kfwxkb,"I’m just saying that Reddit will always be full of salt and hot takes, no matter what the thread.

Even if it’s a memorial for a deceased NBA legend, the bottom of the thread will have debates about their legacy and if they were overrated."
24105,2020-12-19 02:27:55,kfwxkb,I mean since it's year one KD and Kyrie get a slight pass this year.  But anything less than a game 7 round 2 exit would probably prompt some bullying. As long as KD and Kyrie can make it to round two and not get swept everything will be fine.
24106,2020-12-19 16:50:27,kfwxkb,I think having 2 ISO gods would hinder you more than help you
24107,2020-12-19 02:17:18,kfwxkb,Hes always been very low time of possession compared to other stars on okc and gsw
24108,2020-12-19 02:20:39,kfwxkb,KD played the same way in Golden State
24109,2020-12-19 03:18:17,kfwxkb,try '42 games' before championship
24110,2020-12-19 02:52:38,kfwxkb,We’ll see it’s still early
24111,2020-12-19 02:44:21,kfwxkb,"oh my, alright man."
24112,2020-12-19 02:42:20,kfwxkb,? i think im the only jazz fan in here and havent been negative at all
24113,2020-12-19 02:53:06,kfwxkb,ya maybe science is better
24114,2020-12-19 02:59:08,kfwxkb,"Might just be a matter of teams used to rush players back from injury, and now they give them the proper amount of time to recover."
24115,2020-12-19 00:31:09,kfwxkb,Because Kyrie would never go 7/23 or 7/24
24116,2020-12-19 02:50:48,kfwxkb,Lmao nets fans talking spicy I love it. Lebron and AD ain’t scared of the nets at all
24117,2020-12-19 03:20:10,kfwxkb,Phil Jackson would be proud
24118,2020-12-19 02:27:20,kfwxkb,"People are weird af with the Celtics conspiracy theories.  We were never in the running for those types of guys before, and we weren't likely to after.  AD always wanted to go to LA.  95% of the league hasn't won a title in the last four years.  Kinda how it works."
24119,2020-12-19 00:09:28,kfwxkb,"the nets only make it IF KD is serviceable. But they do have a shot—even if it’s a sliver.

Celtics have no shot at the ecf"
24120,2020-12-19 02:05:10,kfwxkb,"cp3 will also load manage

you did get 2 players you can get good results out of though, neither will be as good as durant (most likely), but combined they will give more"
24121,2020-12-19 02:04:38,kfwxkb,Add a protected 2nd rounder and we have a deal.
24122,2020-12-19 02:07:25,kfwxkb,How often does he update content?
24123,2020-12-19 00:33:03,kfwxkb,Just gonna need a canelo viewing
24124,2020-12-19 02:34:56,kfwxkb,Nets bucks and Celtics and heat are clear top 4 in the east. Nets are unproven. Bucks disappoint in the playoffs every year. And heat and Celtics are even. It’s a toss up
24125,2020-12-19 01:57:01,kfwxkb,"Sure, Brooklyn & Miami would be favorites for a few years for sure. But they’ll keep getting older & the Jays (most likely) will continue improving. They’re both locked down for 5 years & Kembas contract is for the next three, so we could always retool within their contracts if it doesn’t work out. I’m not expecting the Celtics to win it all in the next two years, I’m just expecting them to stay extremely competitive while our young players hopefully improve"
24126,2020-12-19 01:06:37,kfwxkb,"Hey, fair enough. Did some research and saw that his mother was Lakota. He *is* weird. Lots of New Agey idiots appropriate Native culture for their nonsense, but in this case he is justified."
24127,2020-12-19 01:03:42,kfwxkb,Too bad he can't drive himself away then. need a bigger sage to burn
24128,2020-12-19 01:07:53,kfwxkb,Cash App please!
24129,2020-12-19 01:10:08,kfwxkb,I’ll take you up on it :)
24130,2020-12-19 01:29:15,kfwxkb,ohhh
24131,2020-12-19 02:00:10,kfwxkb,No I dont know that. Kyrie is not afraid of Boston fans. Thats the propoganda the celtics fans need to tell themselves to feel ok that he pulled an okey doke on them and left
24132,2020-12-19 01:39:08,kfwxkb,he has 5 points lol

24137,2020-12-19 00:42:41,kfwxkb,I find it hard that a career 47 percent shooter would shooter worse than a career 41% shooter 😂
24138,2020-12-19 02:53:32,kfwxkb,And you shouldn't be. But it ain't gonna be no 5 game series for the chip. Hell it took 6 games to handle the heat. If you run into the Nets its gonn be a war and may the best team win
24139,2020-12-19 02:28:19,kfwxkb,You guys had the picks to make it work though. You don’t think AD types would go even if your team was primed for a title?
24140,2020-12-19 00:12:37,kfwxkb,Guess Tatum and Brown gotta keep Blowin Minds
24141,2020-12-19 00:12:39,kfwxkb,Screenshotting this so I can find some self worth living vicariously through a basketball team by pointing out your zero degree Kelvin take.

24147,2020-12-19 02:25:34,kfwxkb,Well if we ignore reality then I agree with you. Just look at that sage shit. They're in each others' heads.

24151,2020-12-19 02:30:27,kfwxkb,"If he wanted to, I don't think the IT thing would have changed things.  He wanted to go to LA and play with Lebron, and he was pretty sure he could get it."

24160,2020-12-19 01:21:00,kfwxkb,You gotta hold up your side

KD already the best player on the court at 80%.😂"
