I came out pretty recently myself (and I had the same religious background as you), and it was a rough go. Still is rough at times. The queer friends I met along the way though really helped me out. They’ve been there to give me advice about certain situations, there when I needed someone to talk to who’d understand or even there to remind me that being queer was okay. Discovering new parts of yourself can be daunting and confusing so having people in your corner who’ve been through it too really helps.

Second, take you time. Figuring out who you are has no deadline. There is no need to dive head first, unless that’s what you’re wanting to do. Go at you pace. You have your whole life to figure things out. 

One last thing. My queer mentor told me two things that have always stuck with me about apps like Grindr and sex, so I’ll share them with you.

1) Be safe. There are crazy people on Grindr or any app for that matter. Let a good friend know where you are, in case you need to bail. And if it seems the least bit sketchy don’t go. Trust your gut not your dick 

2) Know your value. You’re more valuable than being fucked by a guy who won’t remember your first name a week from now. Sex is fun, but don’t lose yourself to it.

Hope this helped! If you need anything else feel free to reach out!"

13,2020-03-10 00:39:56,fg4np7,There was no way she'd lose to Brooke in that lipsync. Tyra was affirmatively robbed. She had a better track and would've won the lipsync.
14,2020-03-10 00:42:04,fg4np7,Tyra was in the bottom 4 times!!!
15,2020-03-10 00:45:05,fg4np7,Brooke was in the bottom 3 times. Had only placed higher than safe twice. Tyra was on her fourth bottom but had 2 wins and 2 highs.
16,2020-03-10 01:00:12,fg4np7,It doesn't matter no one has ever survived their fourth time in the bottom
17,2020-03-10 01:28:46,fg4np7,"No one has ever had four bottoms, 2 wins and went against someone with 3 bottoms and 1 win. Also Kameron survived her fourth lipsync, against a much better performer in Asia O'Hara."
18,2020-03-10 01:50:29,fg4np7,That was due to Asia being a poor planner

Even if she bottomed more, she performed better."

25,2020-02-19 23:36:37,f6jijc,"Thoughts: No. 


Please keep in mind that Jeffree and Shane are both acting to a point. Don’t try to sexualise their relationship - there is no sexual tension, they’re just mlm friends, sexualising that is just really not cool. Them having chemistry as friends does not equate to them wanting to fuck each other. 


If anyone has uncomfortable sexual tension it’s Jeffree and Garrett. ETA: and this is only because J continually makes inappropriate comments towards G.


ETA again: it costs 0$ not to post this and fetishise gay (bi) men, OP."
26,2020-02-19 23:45:30,f6jijc,"I see absolutely no chemistry between them, not sure how anyone does."
27,2020-02-20 00:08:15,f6jijc,">Okay please no one come for me too quickly - I know Shane is committed to Ryland and would never ever cheat or anything BUT the sexual tension between Shane and Jeffree is insane. I just want to see what everyone else thinks about it, if you agree? It's pretty palpable, they have great chemistry. Also, it seems to me that Shane has a history of using making videos as an excuse to hang out with people he is crushing on. E.g. when he first met Lisa Shwartz he cast her as his love interest in one of his videos so they could kiss. He also encouraged people to ship him with Joey Graceffa  so they could make videos together all the time (I'm not necessarily saying Shane had a crush on Joey Graceffa but at the same time I think he did, even maybe just unconsciously).

Perfect example of toxic masculinity hard at work.

Two dudes can't be open and vulnerable with each other without it being flagged as ""insane levels of sexual tension"""
28,2020-02-20 02:35:05,f6jijc,"I think the sexual tension and chemistry that you're interpreting between Shane and Jeffree is platonic chemistry tbh. I think you have it misconstrued, feel free to @ me if they ever end up fucking lmao"
29,2020-04-17 13:13:47,g30g4e,"Yeah this is probably a fancast posted by someone as it is quite easy to edit the imdb info.

although the cast is quite good.

This happened last year too."
30,2020-04-17 18:45:34,g30g4e,"Most of the cast is amazing - but it’s fake. Justine is included, she’s canonically double dead at this point."
31,2020-04-18 02:39:21,g2of61,"Purple Pandas is going to absolutely destroy. Techno, Tommy, and Phil are very skilled players, and Wilbur isn't a liability.

I have no idea where this weird meme that Tommy is going to bring the team down came from when Tommy is one of the best players in the tournament. 

For my ranking though:

1. Purple Pandas
2. Green Guardians
3. Red Rabbits
4. Aqua Horses
5. Pink Parrots

I don't know the rest of the people so I can't rank them."
32,2020-04-18 15:03:31,g2of61,"Thank you all for your predictions, I honestly think that this is the most stacked MCC so far. I don't really have a set place where each team will go, but I have a rough area where each team could plcae.

Red Rabbits: 1st-4th

I really like this team. All members of this team can carry their weight and Krtzyy and CaptainSparkles have placed top 3 before. My only worry for this team is consistency, they can't just do mediocre-good for the first few games and pop off the last few because there are teams that are able to consistently play well throughout the event.

Orange Ocelots: 8th-10th

Like Xhrek said, this team is most likely going to be fighting for 9th place. There isn't much to say here. They have a small chance of possibly passing either lime or yellow but it is not likely. Maybe RT can win another Hole-In-the-Wall round?

Yellow Yaks: 6th-9th

I expect this team to do well in games that involve 1.15 mechanics seeing as some of these guys participate in HermitCraft and other survival realms, worlds, and servers. I don't see them doing well in many other games though.

Lime Llamas: 7th-9th

Some of the previous winners teaming up with James Charles and Joey Graceffa. I don't think Scott and Shelby will get a top 10 rank this time around because a lot of those points were gained by teaming with the powerhouse of Pete and Vikk, but they can maybe claim a place in the top 7 if they do well enough.

Green Guardians: 1st-3rd

This team, unless they completely blow it, is going to be a finalist. This team is entirely made up of previous winners and Vikk and Pete compensate for Micheal and Burren's bad games, and I think that Micheal and Burren can compensate for Pete and Vikk's bad games. I honestly can not think of a game where this team can do bad. Battle Box maybe, but I think that will be covered by Micheal and Burren. Unless other teams make big moves, this team will do well.

Cyan Creepers: 3rd-7th

This team is going to do one of two things, pop off in the PvP modes and maybe place top 5, or do decent in the PvP modes and place bottom 5. In the other modes, such as Hole-In-the-Wall or Parkour, I think it will be all Calvin. If they can win the Pvp modes, then they will do well.

Aqua Horses: 2nd-6th

This team **can** make the finals, but I think it is unlikely. Quig and HBomb are some of the best players in the event, but Orion and Strawburry are simply just not the best. I watched a small amount of HBomb stream with Quig and Orion and it still seems as if Quig and HBomb will have to play very well to make up for Orion and Strawburry.

Blue Bats: 9th-10th

I honestly don't have anything to say. Last week they escaped the basement of last place, but I don't think they will this time unless they can outplay Orange.

Purple Pandas: 1st-5th

This team will either get first or crash and burn. I don't think there will be an in-between. As I already said, this team needs synergy. Techno's teams in the past have always replaced it with ""LeTs JuSt LeAvE eVeRyThInG tO tHe BlAdE"" but they simply can't this week. It can't just be a bully Tommy stream, they need to work as a team.

Pink Parrots: 2nd-5th

I feel like people are kind of sleeping on this team. Solidarity played really well last time and Martyn is also capable of playing well. Can they play better than the other stacked teams in the event? Probably not, but I still think that this team are able to place top 5."
33,2020-04-17 21:26:06,g2of61,"red, green, and purple are pretty evenly matched. dodgebolt is definitely going to be two of those three teams. imo the whole thing will depend on the order of the games. if games like sg/skyblockle are last then red will dominate but other games like build mart will be good for more flexible teams"

1 - Green Guardians 

2 - Purple Pandas

3 - Red Rabbits

36,2020-04-16 23:35:07,g2of61,"Everyone is saying purple Pandas will destroy and I don't really know why
They only have 3 good players(wilbur can do ok but he isn't good)
And vikks team has 4(everyone on that team won before)
CaptainSparklez also has a team of 4 decent players

I think its between those 3 but it will probably be close"
37,2020-04-18 08:24:57,g2of61,"Most likely,

top 3 is between Red, Green, Purple (Depends on game order and if anyone chokes)

4-7 is between Yellow, Aqua, Cyan, Pink (Aqua has an edge here, being the only team without anyone new, but I think Pink will do well also.)

8th will be Lime (Scott and Shelby won last time, but I dont see them doing as well this time around)

and Orange/Blue will fight for 9th (no offense, but statistically its self explanatory)"
38,2020-04-18 02:58:43,g2of61,aqua horses are on there twice
39,2020-04-18 02:59:04,g2of61,"Idk why you say they will destroy
As you said purple has 3 very skilled players while green has 4(michael and Burren got 3rd and 4th the mcc they won)
Also blue has 3 good players too
Also the tommy meme came from smp earth where he would lose every war against techno"
40,2020-04-18 18:59:29,g2of61,Look Tommy’s a good player but his age takes down his skill buy like 4 Wilburs
41,2020-04-24 01:49:11,g2of61,"Just a question but how would burren and micheal cover for vikk and pete in build battle. Vikk and pete are vastly better at pretty much every mknigame, especially pvp."
42,2020-04-18 18:01:46,g2of61,yellow is pretty decent. 2 hermitcraft members and anyone on hermitcraft knows minecraft pretty well as far as im concerned. besides false im not sure there are really any pvpers though. probably will be around 6/7th
43,2020-04-19 19:26:40,g2of61,Dang it I was incorrect.
44,2020-04-17 15:40:10,g2of61,"Since all 3 of those teams are good it will depend on game order and skipped games.

E.g., if Build Mart/Hole in the Wall is played last, Purple will lose, but if skyblockle/rocket spleef are played last, Purple will win."
45,2020-04-18 15:44:51,g2of61,They’re gonna split up and somehow still get 4th and 6th
46,2020-04-19 13:09:24,g2of61,Michael and Burren got hard carried by Vikk and Pete. Don't know what you're talking about.
47,2020-04-19 22:15:34,g2of61,"yeah, panda's individual quality really paid off. They've got three strong players and synergized pretty well. Not as well as Vikk and Pete ofc but it was enough. They ended up with I think the biggest lead in MCC history? I'm not sure."
48,2020-04-17 18:18:23,g2of61,"I don't think Hole in the Wall is bad for Purple, but I think Battle Box is really bad for Purple. Last time around, Blue Bats absolutely dominated Battle Box and the majority of the Red team is the exact same as Blue. For Green, although Pete and Vikk did absolutely terrible last time, Micheal and Burren developed strategies for that game. I also don't think Rocket Spleef will advantage Purple very much, because last time Pete won 3/3 and there are teams such as Aqua and Yellow who will probably do very well. 

What purple needs in synergy, it can't just be Techno getting kills and Tommy clutching or Phil carrying in 1.15 modes. They need to work together."
49,2020-04-18 17:03:15,g2of61,lol
50,2020-04-19 20:24:24,g2of61,But they did place 3rd and 4th in MCC1 even though they didn't do as well this time around.
51,2020-04-18 02:17:12,g2of61,"People really do not seem to be talking about Aqua Horses, who I think have a decent chance because they're a very balanced team. Quig and hbomb are very good at both parkour and PVP and have been training Strawburry and Orion throughout the week on stream.  It's also notable that  Quig and Hbomb won MCC2 together and did well in MCC1 (third place if I'm remembering right)."
52,2020-04-18 02:49:22,g2of61,"They do have a good chance as Quig is the best player, and Hbomb is good as well, however they have 2 below average players, and this will hurt them in the parkour games.

On the other hand, Red, Green and Purple have all good or decent players, no one below average, so unless they choke everyone will pull their weight."
53,2020-04-18 02:59:57,g2of61,That's true. I mostly defend Aqua Horses because I'll be watching h and I want him to win but I acknowledge that there are way stronger teams.
54,2020-04-30 07:15:01,gaepdd,How did Matt die seventh if nobody voted him?
55,2020-05-09 02:44:38,gaepdd,"In my opinion Matt should have lived instead of Tim, Nikita should have died 3rd season and ro shoud have lived"

64,2020-06-24 23:01:04,hf8vi4,I think this is good
65,2020-06-23 00:29:48,he46ek,"I think you worded the way a lot of us felt really well. It was hard to read his rant and seeing him say that James needed to be served a slice of humble pie while excusing j*'s actions really just did it for me. 

I spend more time excusing things by shane and Jeffrey then I do actually enjoying their content anymore. Its really sad to see where we ended up from the days of spooky boys and conspiracy theories. :("
66,2020-06-23 02:42:04,he46ek,"Felt the same way. I had criticisms over the series and when it got boring I just didn't bother anymore. 

One minor correction: Jeffree isn't honest. He lies & doubles down to save face, knows how to apologize to quiet people down. And that's what makes him manipulative. 

I don't think Shane would've posted his rant if not for Jeffree's influence. The speculation on his involvement was small, we didn't really know how he felt about James. And this blow up redirected the heat on Shane instead of Jeffree. But maybe it was for the better he let that all out and we finally snapped out of the Shane-tasy."
67,2020-06-23 03:09:19,he46ek,"I feel the exact same way. He may have answered “no” to many of the questions he addressed, but the fact that he knew Tati was making a video in the first place was enough for me to feel disgusted. Whether or not he knew what it would contain, why not encourage her to have a normal adult conversation with James instead of putting your personal business online ? why did Shane support putting drama online? he knew what would happen and didn’t do anything to stop it.

The amount of entitlement and egotism that he complained about is exactly what he displayed in that statement. It’s fucking disgusting and horrible. I used to love Shane, Morgan, and Ryland... but this is so fucking nasty. We just witnessed someone revealing their true colors and it’s dark and shitty."

134,2020-06-18 14:09:05,hbc0hx,"Imo, it definitely is. Its ok to like what you like in your partners. It's also ok to like what you like in people you interact with or the entertainment you consume on TV. If you find something annoying, its ok to not want to watch it.

When your reaction to that is to want to act straighter because of what you've seen, you're dealing with internalized homophobia. This is more than just finding a tv personality annoying. You're seeing that, judging something about yourself that you feel is bad, and then trying to change that.

I'm not a therapist so this isn't something I can really diagnose or help with, but imo (highly untrained opinion) you've internalized a heternormative image of masculinity, and its very possible that there's some issue of acceptance of yourself as a trans man. Maybe when you see these portrayals of different forms of masculinity, it makes you question your own, so you try to change yourself to fit in with the heternormative. 

You should consider seeing an LGBTQ friendly therapist to help you through these issues."
135,2020-06-19 08:57:36,hbc0hx,"I get it to a certain degree. However gay men who are feminine can’t really help it so as long as you don’t have anything against them personally I would say it’s just part of your preference. There is a difference between saying “I would never date a flamboyant gay guy,” and “I have never been attracted to a flamboyant gay guy.” At the end of the day, you like who you like and can’t change that.

Whenever anybody tells me “you’re gay? You’re not flamboyant about it so I would never have guessed!” it actually makes me really happy. Not because there is anything wrong with feminine guys but because I HATE the stereotype that all gay men are feminine and show up on everyone’s gaydar."
136,2020-06-06 21:42:10,gxyv6z,"he said he and Meghan had over a million subscribers combined.

He has 9 million (without factoring in Meghan's subs) now. From what I've heard, TAR actually helped boost his channel to where it is now."
137,2020-06-06 21:50:22,gxyv6z,If you watch their introduction on the first episode of season 22 it shows how many subscribers they each had at the time.
138,2020-06-07 01:24:01,gxyv6z,"Weirdly when I watched that season, I actually knew who he was surprisingly enough."
139,2020-06-07 01:32:35,gxyv6z,"I definitely knew he was, but had no idea who Meghan was at the time."
140,2020-06-06 23:43:33,gxyv6z,I remember watching him back in probably 2010
141,2020-06-07 14:00:12,gxyv6z,"Think he definitely got a boost from the show but is now a pretty big YouTube star. There’s now 4 series of Escape the Night.

Would like to see them return to see if Joey would be less playing to the camera. Meghan always felt a lot more real but was overshadowed by Joeys antics."
142,2020-06-11 06:29:42,gxyv6z,"I'm pretty sure he and Meghan said they had about 500k subscribers combined. He definitely would not be considered a ""big"" YouTuber by today's standards, but back then that was considered quite a bit."
143,2020-06-07 09:36:44,gxyv6z,I was vice versa!
144,2020-06-07 18:51:03,gxyv6z,I would to but from what I heard they don’t want to play again
145,2020-06-07 20:19:43,gxyv6z,Oh really? I didn’t know that. I think they felt hard done by on All Stars given the forced flights on leg 3 which gave them no opportunity to avoid fighting for last again.
146,2020-05-13 01:00:13,giom3g,Joey and the Twinnies were both on the same season of the amazing race
147,2020-05-13 01:00:42,giom3g,They played on The Amazing Race together & were both early boots. So they probably spent a lot of time in sequester together while the rest of the season was filming
148,2020-08-17 23:22:51,ibpd9r,that could actually be a really fun team but Joey might not want to team with them after the whole controversy after they got him trending
149,2020-08-18 00:01:11,ibpd9r,Also JamesCharles
150,2020-08-18 00:56:05,ibpd9r,yeeeeeeeeessssss joey is gonna be confused but yeeees
151,2020-08-17 23:23:49,ibpd9r,"Yeah, I’m hoping he still plays in the event but if he doesn’t I can understand why"
152,2020-08-18 05:01:09,ibpd9r,Is that why he left mid game?
153,2020-08-18 05:52:34,ibpd9r,Wait what happend?
154,2020-08-18 10:34:11,ibpd9r,Yeah...
155,2020-08-16 03:52:13,iakbrg,"I'm glad he apologized and I'm glad people are rightfully calling creators out for their actions, I just wish that people would go before the crowd turns on them and get rid of/genuinely apologize for their problematic content. Problematic content would not be the nail in the coffin it is for so many of these creators if they show that they have genuinely grown from it as a person and display maturity and levelheadedness when called out for it the first time, instead of digging their heels in and refusing to admit when they're wrong.

Instead all these apologies weeks after this started, after the mob came for you, and after everything is said and done just kind of seems empty to me. I am happy that the people who deserve apologies are getting them and that the youtube audience is, in general, realizing more and more about how certain creators are terrible and should not be stanned."
156,2020-08-17 01:18:52,iakbrg,"I could never at the mental gymnastics people getting mad at Joey that he is throwing Shane under the bus. They were both wrong in the video, and he has acknowledged his mistake in participating."
157,2020-08-16 02:15:06,iakbrg,"I may have an unpopular opinion when it comes to Joey, but I do believe this is genuine. I've seen a lot of his content for many years and I can't say I've ever really seen him make any offensive racial comments or make the same ""jokes"" as Shane (if he ever did, I don't think it's been in his content for a long time now, but like I said, nothing sticks out in my mind). I also follow him on social media and he seems to be one of the only influences who is still donating money and sharing resources for BLM. I definitely think this should have been addressed much earlier, but I understand he just went through an intense breakup when this all resurfaced and I'm glad he said something since many influences don't.

ETA: This isn't my apology to accept and my comment wasn't intending to do that, just sharing my thoughts!"
158,2020-08-16 21:40:37,iakbrg,I’m glad he’s sorry and I think that is a nice apology. That being said he tried to blame Shane more than him actually apologizing. Glad he apologized though. Not my apology to accept but I hope he can be forgiven
159,2020-08-16 23:36:35,iakbrg,It’s interesting how a lot of non black people are accepting the apology. Qwhite interesting is it it
160,2020-08-17 11:10:54,iakbrg,tired of influencers calling their actions “mistakes”
161,2020-08-16 14:03:07,iakbrg,"Glad he's apologizing but the way he harps on ""many years ago"" seems like he's distancing himself and minimizing a bit. Seven years is a reasonably long time ago yet to say many years ago seems like a stretch to me? Ultimately, it's not my apology to accept, and like I said, I am glad he apologized. I could be over analyzing. But, just my thoughts. 🤷🏻‍♀️"
162,2020-08-16 19:25:05,iakbrg,"He needs to own up to his shit, he bought the foundation and he put it on. Joey was very good friends with Shane during this time and he is just trying to push the heat onto Shane. Joey was a GROWN MAN and needs to face whatever consequences come his way. He knew what he was doing and he didn't seem uncomfortable at all when he did videos with Shane."
163,2020-08-16 19:01:07,iakbrg,"I agree with you for the most part  - creators should 100% be taking responsibility before getting called out. However, (and keep in mind this isn’t a good/valid excuse) I imagine that since a lot of these creators have been pumping out videos on a regular basis for years, there will be incidents like this one that they probably dont remember and need people to call them out and remind them."
164,2020-08-22 01:57:13,iakbrg,"I remember the video he’s referring to, I’ve never really gotten into seriously following Joey’s stuff but I’ve never disliked him either. He seems like a nice person, and regarding the video, I do remember him looking visibly uncomfortable when Shane said that stuff. A lot of kind of nervous giggles, he didn’t add onto it at all and I think even said at one point “This is so bad, oh no,” or something along those lines. He should’ve spoken up IMO but I can understand why he was nervous to."
165,2020-08-17 03:12:13,iakbrg,"I see what you did there 🌝 and as a black individual, I don’t accept because he was a grown man. And knew better, he is just racist (or was). He might have changed but still."
166,2020-08-17 00:40:37,iakbrg,"That’s how it always is, though. And then they’ll attack, with great vitriol, anyone who doesn’t accept the apology like they did."
167,2020-08-18 05:00:04,iakbrg,"I don’t think that’s fair

If it’s a one or two off thing, it likely is a mistake 

If it’s Shane or J* or a lot of others, it’s a pattern of behavior

I don’t really like Joey anymore (he feels pretty childish and I struggle to believe his dog “accidentally” got pregnant”) but he’s also not someone who is constantly in trouble"
168,2020-08-16 22:31:00,iakbrg,I agree with you. He picked the foundation and he knew his collaborator. He knew the outcome.
169,2020-08-16 20:38:21,iakbrg,"Not trying to be rude, but why do you think he isn’t owning up? He said he was intimidated and embarrassed to speak up but that he was still complicit and that that*he* ignorantly chose the wrong shade."
170,2020-08-16 19:29:01,iakbrg,"Also thanks to everyone who down votes me. I know it's going to happen but you can't hold one person accountable and not others. Joey was in the wrong too and he knew what he was doing, end of story."
171,2020-08-22 03:33:39,iakbrg,"You’ve summed it up pretty well. That’s how I saw the video too. Of course it’s still not okay and the apology isn’t perfect, but I think him saying anything at all and continuing to actively use his platform to support #BLM I think is him putting action to the words."
172,2020-08-20 20:19:43,iakbrg,Lololollol
173,2020-08-18 05:03:20,iakbrg,"a mistake is done unintentionally if you didn’t know better. as an adult, doing what he did is intentional, as a point of trying to do “edgy humor”. literally doing blackface on someone else isn’t a mistake. i’m sure he’s remorseful and understands it’s wrong. but it’s not a mistake. he did it and knew it was wrong. i’m not saying people can’t change for the better, i’m just pointing out that calling blatant actions a mistake is a form of shirking responsibility."
174,2020-08-16 22:51:51,iakbrg,Exactly! He knew what he was doing
175,2020-08-16 20:57:43,iakbrg,Because it feels like he isn't taking the full responsibility and still trying to blame Shane for it.
176,2020-08-30 18:38:21,iakbrg,"He also expressed discomfort and says how the foundation is much too dark for Shane. A mistake is doing something ignorantly. It's not a mistake. Nevermind that the dude was friends with Shane for a while and was likely aware of Shane's blackface Content, just saying."
177,2020-08-15 22:20:54,iagea6,">6\. The fact that Dream's chicken got stuck on top of the voting arena TWICE

The second time it wasn't even on top. It was on the side literally just hovering in the air."
178,2020-08-16 00:52:49,iagea6,I think dogebolt has to be mentioned as that was incredibly intense plus the brilliance of Burren going off. I agree with everything else though although I felt skyblockle was underwhelming as it was just people camping in the middle which wasn’t unfun it just meant there was less action.
179,2020-08-16 04:06:45,iagea6,i was watching from the green guardians pov and i gotta agree this was a great mcc. imo the guardians all had nice chemistry and really encouraged each other to succeed. i hope they team up again or are in similar teams!! dodgebolt was absolutely amazing!! props to burren
180,2020-08-15 22:04:49,iagea6,Why did Joey leave?
181,2020-08-16 08:48:23,iagea6,9. Yellow Yaks came 4th. I think only time Hermits have been that close to top place was in MCC5 survival games.
182,2020-08-15 22:22:42,iagea6,Anyone got the link to Dreams stream? Just got back from work and was hoping to watch the replay.
183,2020-08-15 22:39:10,iagea6,"Hey, I couldn’t make the stream. Who won?"
184,2020-08-19 03:25:08,iagea6,Not sure how significant this is but also eret speedran the redownloading of Minecraft
185,2020-08-15 23:51:47,iagea6,"The only thing that mcc needs to fix is the glitches and bugs. But overall, the championships are rlly fun to watch!"
186,2020-08-16 00:05:19,iagea6,"Oh so Joey trending on Twitter was due to Dream stans. I see. Well that ended up leading to a bunch of unrelated randos calling Joey a racist because of an old video he did forever ago and apologized for already. So... yeah. Knowing this now, I feel bad for Joey."
187,2020-08-15 23:28:49,iagea6,Replace Cub with Grian and smooth out some of the glitches and you've got the perfect MCC championship.
188,2020-08-16 08:47:34,iagea6,It did a Wilbur
189,2020-08-16 01:15:23,iagea6,"Yea I agree dodge bolt tournament was chefs kiss and skyblockle was less than desirable. I wish they would’ve had an epic battle but, at the end of Techno’s stream Scott (I think) said it’s getting a revamp so that people don’t do that anymore which is good."
190,2020-08-16 01:52:13,iagea6,"Yeah I watched it from Dream’s perspective and Techno made a great case against these kind of tactics in skyblocks, so I was surprised to find how many people enjoyed that part of the tournament. Although in retrospect, it was a really smart strat and probably hype for fans of the cyan creepers"
191,2020-08-16 00:57:47,iagea6,Sorry didn’t realise you put dogebolt my bad.
192,2020-08-15 22:15:29,iagea6,he had to go.
193,2020-08-16 10:17:33,iagea6,He got cancelled on Twitter for doing blackface in a make-up collab with Shane Dawson.
194,2020-08-15 22:06:29,iagea6,I have no idea
195,2020-08-15 22:31:35,iagea6,"Dream's Past livestreams are usually difficult to find. Someone might know it.

198,2020-08-16 19:02:17,iagea6,I swear the Twitter community just has no empathy or respect for people after they make a mistake in some kind of video or event
199,2020-08-16 01:30:48,iagea6,That would be good as the more fighting the better. Also I feel they really need to add more food because half the problems seem to come from hunger.
200,2020-08-16 18:58:06,iagea6,Pete also mentioned these things and more in one of his streams a few days before the event

205,2020-08-15 21:44:20,iafm7b,I hope all the streamers and noxcrew and everyone address this and talk some sense into that crowd
206,2020-08-15 21:46:09,iafm7b,It's because people dislike him for previous videos that he's made and were already trying to cancel him so they take any chance they can to put him down
207,2020-08-15 21:47:44,iafm7b,He's trending because he did blackface and refused to apologize. Him doing bad at MCC only started the trend but him doing blackface made it last
208,2020-08-15 21:59:55,iafm7b,Why was this post removed? It didn’t violate any rules.
209,2020-08-15 21:48:02,iafm7b,"bruh it wasn't just ""previous videos"" it was blackface"
210,2020-08-15 22:05:02,iafm7b,Did you remove the post?
211,2020-08-15 22:13:56,iafm7b,I don't want any posts about the drama because it's just going to end up controversial and eventually there will be posts purely about the drama and not MCC
212,2020-08-15 21:49:53,iafm7b,homie idk what he did i just checked twitter and people were cancelling hiim for prev videos i dont watch joey lol
213,2020-08-15 13:56:29,ia51s0,"I sort of agree with these predictions but I honestly think you shouldnt put stuff like ""guaranteed no chance of happening"". Things always surprise us. Like Orange last MCC messing up a pretty manageable dodgebolt win. The return of bingo but fast. Technos tryhard build mart strategy. MCC always contains something extremely surprising, whether it be the event or the players. I am not criticizing the predictions since I mostly agree with them, but I feel that you should at least phrase it nicer and have a more open mindset.
Good day to you! Downvote me if you want to but think about it at least."

219,2020-08-15 22:17:29,ia51s0,Thats not the point lol. They almost did in fact.
220,2020-08-22 09:23:53,ia51s0,this aged a bit bad but atleast they won!
221,2020-08-16 07:38:57,ia51s0,I definitely think the team had been in calls together they weren't awkward at the start at all. They must've practiced a little bit more than they led everyone to believe.
222,2020-08-14 21:38:41,i9qh8e,I'm rooting for Cyan Creepers but I've been watching TapL's streams and im pretty sure he's never used Elytras/rockets/tridents before as he usually plays 1.8 which makes me worry
223,2020-08-14 18:01:35,i9qh8e,"for the Red Rabbits, I respect the 8th placement, but instead of comoaring Scott to Techno, I'd compare Tommy to Techno and Scott to Seapeekay."
224,2020-08-15 02:02:42,i9qh8e,Joel is not a bad player in my opinion in every Mc Champinships Joel has been in He has done really good and that’s why the aqua axolotls will get top 2
225,2020-08-14 20:24:28,i9qh8e,imo Red Rabbits will get top 4
226,2020-08-14 17:48:03,i9qh8e,'Solidarity is actually a very solid player'. I see what you did there 😜
227,2020-08-14 20:11:32,i9qh8e,"agree mostly but I think Dream would be the better player in Pink Parrots, Dream has consistently (well, he's only been in 2 MCCs) beaten technoblade in coins"
228,2020-08-14 23:11:06,i9qh8e,yeahh that could affect him but I think he'll be able to adjust as it is not that hard
229,2020-08-14 20:20:54,i9qh8e,I was actually comparing the team to Techno's team in MCC4. The one where they got the Point Record
230,2020-08-14 20:28:50,i9qh8e,I hope they do too. I wish everyone in that team plays well to get top 4
231,2020-08-14 20:26:59,i9qh8e,"hahaha well he is doe, the stats don't lie. If he wasn't solid then I think I'd put them in the 7th spot"
232,2020-08-14 20:20:00,i9qh8e,"uhm no, MCC 6 was techno's worst performance but still managed to get 4th. The ""beaten technoblade in coins"" is really an overstatement. There was a user who posted that if you take away the Sands of Times coins in MCC7 Dream was not even in the top 10 lol. Techno plays for the team that's why he gets to the finals. Dream plays to beat techno :))"
233,2020-08-14 23:47:19,i9qh8e,hopefully!! im just worried that he focuses too much on parkour / battle box and not enough on the other aspects.
234,2020-08-14 20:22:00,i9qh8e,"oh, makes sense, it was sad to see them loose the point record."
235,2020-08-14 21:25:54,i9qh8e,"Solidarity is a toss up because he has his moments like in mcc 2 he placed 5th but in mcc7 he placed 36th and in mcc6 he placed in the twenties and that was on the strongest team he has ever had. Now he is far from bad, he is just inconsistent. Though this mcc I feel like he will place top 13 because he seems like he will have a comeback at some point, and it seems like nows the time."
236,2021-02-03 12:43:13,i9qh8e,Dream is only really good at Sands of Time and parkour
237,2020-08-14 20:56:03,i9qh8e,"what are you talking about in MCC6 Techno got 9th place

regarding taking away SoT points for Dream, yea if u take all 100% of Dream's SoT points that would be devastating, but realistically if they didn't funnel all their points to Dream he would still have gained points in SoT so i think its a little unfair to say that he wouldnt be in top 10  


Edit: i just realized ur probably talking about team scores, im talking about individual scores"
238,2020-08-14 20:25:35,i9qh8e,Whut? I think techno still holds the record for most points individually and the sleepyboys still hold the most points as a team
239,2020-08-14 21:34:42,i9qh8e,"I think some players tend to do well if they have a good or competent teammate. Him being teamed with Pete, i think he'll do well but yeah I think he is inconsistent. he's not bad though I think he just had bad teammates that's why he under performs."
240,2020-08-14 21:05:36,i9qh8e,"No, when I referred to ""take away SOT coins in MCC7"" I mean all players not just dream. When you do that it clearly shows the difference in placement and just shows how flawed your ""he's better cuz he got more coins"" mindset is. So you're argument about dream being better cuz he beat techno in coins is bs considering they funneled all the coins to him just for him to flex he got more points in reality he only placed 3rd just because of that"
241,2020-08-14 20:32:20,i9qh8e,"nope  Pete's team got 25346 in MCC 7, Techno's team only had 24342 and Pete got 4221 points but Techno only had 3902."
242,2020-08-14 22:07:14,i9qh8e,"1. could you link the post where they take away SoT points? Those stats would be interesting to look at
2. when you take away SoT points you need to add an extra event otherwise it would be 7 events played, that would also change the point distribution at the end
3. yea honestly I can't really disagree with your points any longer but idk it just feels like Dream plays better than Technoblade ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯"
243,2020-08-14 20:41:55,i9qh8e,wym? Techno actually had 4307 in MCC4. But Green Guardians did beat Purple Pandas record
244,2020-08-15 00:03:02,i9qh8e,Dream is a better solo player but techno is the better leader aight?
245,2020-08-14 23:08:53,i9qh8e,"This will explain a lot. Meh, don't worry with the new SOT update where they will divide all the gather coins evenly as a team no more funneling will happen. Then we'll see whose better because ""the other person has more coins""

285,2020-08-09 21:03:20,i6pu5n,"Here are my opinions that no one wanted:

**Avalon Deluxe** is just 6 years too late, unfortunately.

**Vampire ECG** looks like fun, but I can't support that price tag

**Ultimate Werewolf** is past its prime, people have moved on.

**Massive Darkness** has such a mediocre reputation that I can't believe how much funding 2.0 has.  I guess CMON brand will never die. 

**Arcana Rising** first glance game looks pretty and like it could be fun.  But the way Grey Fox Games handles Kickstarters has left a really sour taste in my mouth and I can't back anything from them

**Wanderhome** pretty cover art.  Seems like it's not developed enough yet for KS, but I admit I didn't go in depth to fully evaluate the game"

287,2020-08-10 02:43:44,i6pu5n,Still patiently waiting for ISS Vanguard.
288,2020-08-10 00:03:24,i6pu5n,Anyone else intrigued by **Lunar Base**?
289,2020-08-10 00:24:37,i6pu5n,"I find what they’re doing with the release schedule for massive darkness 2 fascinating. So in 48 hours of zombicide you had 25 missions and 30 extra unique sculpts unlocked for a total of 31 unlocks in two days , massive darkness 1 had just tons of extra minis sets, and environment sets for columns and chests, with a ton of heroes and a new class.

So we’ve basically been sitting for two days now with only daily unlocks, and the campaign has been under massive darkness funding (Day to day aka day 3 compared to day 3 net new revenue) with 3 paid addons already released. They’ve only shown 1/4 of what I’d expect to see by now in a cmon campaign (even compared to zombicide with its daily unlocks) and I’m personally bored.

I wonder how much money they lost outside their core audience going that route.

Having played it, it’s a great version of zombicide with class mini games that feel impactful. The games curve goes from enemy groups possibly one shoting you to clearing waves of bad guys in one turn, and you can feel that great progression and massive amounts of loot that you’d Generally see over a 20 hour campaign in about an hour and a half.

It’s the best edition of zombicide, but boy would I want to see some actual reason to back it sometime in the next two weeks. I’m not looking forward to $100 base and $40 shipping to the west coast again when the base game will hit $60 in a year."
290,2020-08-09 20:48:12,i6pu5n,"I’ve been keeping an eye on MD2, but I have to admit, I think I’m going to pass.

Both due to some of the art and mini designs not sitting well with me, and because of some rules issues coming from people testing the game on TTS. The female Necromancer design is (in my personal opinion) atrocious, and some of the other minis just don’t fit the theme at all. The hands on the naga’s and shadow demons look comically large, to the point of absurdity. Also not a fan of the goose motif on the angels.

More so, many of the issues that plague MD1 are still present in MD2 based on play testers, including the unbalanced scaling, retaliation damage from monsters being too high and affecting ranged attacks, etc. Some of the viable changes would require changing materials like the dice, which they won’t be doing. Also, much of the loot you get ends up being extremely samey and doesn’t really differentiate itself. Leveling up is discouraged because it’s easier to just grind low level mobs, and then level up right before you hit the boss.

While the idea of a more beers’n’pretzels kind of dungeon crawl is appealing, and lots of loot is cool, MD2 just isn’t hitting it for me."
291,2020-08-09 20:31:09,i6pu5n,"Thank you so much for this every week!
I don’t think I can resist the collectors edition of Petrichor :)"
292,2020-08-09 23:07:10,i6pu5n,Anyone know anything about **Backwoods**?  The theme is right up my alley.
293,2020-08-10 07:45:36,i6pu5n,"The huge amount **Escape the Night** has raised puzzles me a bit. It looks lovely but gameplay seems very basic and underdeveloped and mostly revolves around trying to roll two dice to beat a number. I've never heard of the show before -- is it massively popular? I guess it must be, I'd genuinely never heard of it.

**Roll Camera!** won me over though, it just looks a lot of fun."
294,2020-08-09 22:05:55,i6pu5n,"Super excited for Massive Darkness 2! One of my favorite artists and in love with how a lot of the sculpts look. Only real complaint is the halo things that don't translate well to the sculptures. 

Super super like the monster minis and the first necro + monk minis!"
295,2020-08-09 21:53:25,i6pu5n,"I backed **With a Smile and a Gun**. It's actually only my second Kickstarter, sprawlopolis a while back being the other. I just can't resist the idea of a two player area control game. Hopefully it turns out decent!"
296,2020-08-10 04:20:16,i6pu5n,"I went ahead and backed **Dollars to Donuts.** I saw an ad somewhere for it yesterday that emphasized that it was by the same team behind **Point Salad,** so I decided to take a look at it. It looks like a decent little game; it doesn't look like anything that will set the gaming world on fire but it is visually appealing and I like games about food. Food-themed games seem to be easy to get to the table when gaming with my wife and daughter. There are so many decent games based on food as well that it is easy to throw together a whole night with that theme (something like: Dollars to Donuts, Point Salad, New York Slice, Sushi Roll, and Just Deserts)."

Not badly priced but pricey shipping to Australia is keeping from backing it right now. Plus new dev/publisher always means risk."
319,2020-08-10 09:28:04,i6pu5n,"The devs had a public preview event in Tallinn last week and I got to play a few rounds - it's a pretty solid filler, I'm getting a copy for myself and another as a gift for a friend. I think it might need some house rules to negate some of the luck of the draw though and tinker with balancing.

They also released the game on TTS for free, so do recommend trying it out on there."
320,2020-08-10 03:06:33,i6pu5n,"Since you've played MD 2, do you think its the type of game you'd enjoy doing a campaign of? Or only good for 1 shot games. I'm kinda back and worth on that $45 campaign expansion."
321,2020-08-10 07:31:50,i6pu5n,"Bloodborne had a total 40 unlocks. This campaign will just my daily unlocks have 21, and I think you can expect 19 chests planned. The daily unlocks is more to easier control the pace not to end up in a trudvang situation."
322,2020-08-09 21:06:05,i6pu5n,"Not that I’m looking to back a dungeon crawler at the moment as I’m waiting on bloodborne still, but I’m not even tempted by MD2. The miniatures don’t really appeal, more the monster ones than the player ones. I can deal with that necro mini, the snakes though hmm I’ve go to hand it to them they are different!

I watched a little of the play through and it didn’t seem that exciting. I don’t mind dice rolling, in fact as an ex d&d and war hammer player I quite enjoy it! It just didn’t seem all that satisfying or have much tension. Maybe it’s because all the dice are rolled then things die. Seems a bit quick to sweep lots of minis off the board."
323,2020-08-09 22:05:08,i6pu5n,"MD1 has been my ONLY kickstarter regret, and I've backed over 20 board game kickstarters.

They shoved the zombicide system(which I actually like) into a campaign system and it did not work at all. Couple that with a bunch of generic minis and it's a big meh."
324,2020-08-09 21:01:56,i6pu5n,"For me, the biggest selling Point are the angel minis. But as of right know, there are no KS exclusive ones, so I think I'll wait for the (german) retail. 
And the fucking goose ruins the whole michael mini."
325,2020-08-09 22:48:32,i6pu5n,"To be fair, CMON gameplay videos are usually really bad (in my opinion, at least). The Blood Rage video made me cringe and bail on the Kickstarter, but I ended up gambling on a late pledge since the hype never died and I'm glad I did.

I don't think any beer and pretzel miniature game will translate all that well to video.

I'm pretty much just backing at this point for the upgrade pack. I'm not sold on the stretch goals either though - to name only a couple problems, the goose is dumb and one woman looks like a man. I like the core game monsters though. Skeletons, gargoyles, etc look cool. I don't love the heaven/hell theme. I didn't like it during the AQ Inferno campaign and I don't like it now. I just want more typical fantasy. But there's enough of a mix here that I don't mind. Plus I can pull season 1 minis into the mix to shake it up.

Regardless, I'm on the fence. Like I say, I'll probably get the core for the upgrade pack, and I'll decide on the rest depending on SGs.

I won't bash the gameplay just yet because all we've seen is a tutorial/intro. Much like zombicied, major gripes (like ranged retaliation) can probably be house ruled."
326,2020-08-09 23:03:56,i6pu5n,I am right there with you for the same reasons.  Hard pass.
327,2020-08-09 21:00:42,i6pu5n,"I’ve decided to jump on it as well. Theme and art are great!

Looks like it would be a good game to play with people that are turned off by traditional board game themes, and it still sounds like there’s a good solid game underneath."
328,2020-08-10 00:35:21,i6pu5n,That’s a pretty pretty box at a very good price
329,2020-08-10 18:31:30,i6pu5n,"Yeah, it was a popular show on YouTube Red, my sister would use my account to watch it. It was basically a Clue-styled escape game featuring popular YouTubers vloggers, with what looked like good set and prop designs, so that's why the audience was so large."
330,2020-08-10 10:19:00,i6pu5n,"I really like some of it but the lack of wandering monsters (and variety of them) is bumming me out. I picked up a lightbringer pledge off bgg a while ago to paint and the monsters are a huge highlight, some of my favorite stuff I've painted. These ones aren't doing it for me.

Having said that, the minions are all fantastic! Absolutely love the skeletons, fire dudes and gargoyles. So much more variety than md1. And the heros so far are great! I actually really like the witch necromancer, even if some don't. The new wizard is awesome! And it looks like I'll be able to use most md1 stuff in md2, so maybe the variety will be fine.

So I'm really on the fence here. Keeping a close eye on those unlocks! I'm out right now but I really want to be tempted in, if that makes sense?"
331,2020-08-10 04:31:10,i6pu5n,"Dollars to Donuts is the kind of easy to teach and play game where I can teach people with a great them who are not typical board gamers. I would even line it up into a filler. 

I like Point Salad for the same reason. I have high hopes for Calico as well. All these games are easy to teach, have some strategy but don't burn you out."
332,2020-08-09 22:32:15,i6pu5n,"Genuine question that I asked elsewhere on this thread: with **Quest**, why would I want to take away the voting? That seems like the main takeaway. That and the adding of the automatic pass unless you're the one person who can ignore the command."
333,2020-08-10 17:13:23,i6pu5n,Oh how I wish that walnut was the cherry price instead (I know very unrealistic but damn is that walnut beautiful). Here's hoping if the kickstarter is successful enough they will come out with additional stains for the maple. A walnut stain would be perfect.
334,2020-08-10 22:36:07,i6pu5n,"Well if it launches the 11th it'll be on next week's list, but considering it's an accessory I don't think it will"
335,2020-08-11 00:08:46,i6pu5n,"I just popped into the comments section and it looks pretty entertaining. Apparently they just announced in an update that the base pledge of $25usd does not include stretch goals. You need to add $20usd to get stretch goals which are just 6 cards if they manage to unlock them all. 


I have no skin in this fight but I'm a terrible person so I'll be keeping an eye on the comments to see how it goes."
336,2020-08-10 21:05:37,i6pu5n,"I have it on my Saved list and I'm thinking about it. I think my boyfriend would really enjoy that one, just because we like the show, and he loves comics in general."
337,2020-08-10 01:22:34,i6pu5n,Not sure I follow your logic....
338,2020-08-09 21:18:34,i6pu5n,">These posts are my primary source of news concerning new games

That's such a bummer! So many great games come out every year that don't use Kickstarter, you're really missing out."
339,2020-08-09 22:19:08,i6pu5n,"Their Reavers of Midgard fulfillment was a disaster(I was a backer). The card finish was promised then when it wasn’t delivered they just said “Oh deal with it” essentially and it’s cost prohibitive to re-manufacture. I also backed Tsukuyumi and that’s very delayed with not a ton of information besides random updates on where they are. It will likely be a year late or so. I tried to request a refund even accepting some of the loss due to KS fees and they flat out refused.

I have stopped backing a lot of KS unless it’s something I really want but I will refuse to back another Grey Fox KS. Besides, you can get them at retail for cheaper if it’s even that good of a game."
340,2020-08-10 02:06:00,i6pu5n,"Why haven't they released a rulebook? Is it because it's almost identical to the original versions of the game? Is this worth a new name and new art? Or is this just Avalon/Resistance, 2nd Edition?"
341,2020-08-10 02:22:40,i6pu5n,"I think they are causing a lot of confusion by bundling Quest with Avalon, but it is indeed a different game. It appears the roles are different (although there are similar ones), in addition to no voting the leader is chosen and every player leads only once, and there is a 'must not fail' card played every round. It doesn't sound like much but from watching the livestream it looks like it changes the dynamic quite a bit so I think it looks interesting."
342,2020-08-10 05:59:22,i6pu5n,"Looks like it has some werewolf-esque kind of roles with certain powers. So basically same game but with unique powers for everyone? Feels a bit uninspired, but I still need to watch what reviewers have to say about it. Maybe they'll shed some light."
343,2020-08-10 21:53:25,i6pu5n,"Ok, I'll bite.  

Firstly, A PDF Print N Play would have everything you need to play.  Is that complete?  I argue no.  Same way I argue a watered down base game is not complete compared to their higher pledge. 

Second, let's ignore the first point for a minute.  You're still talking about a $52 card game with a couple of tokens.  That's very pricey in my mind.  I would expect this game to get down to $35 range after it makes it to OLGS, then lower than that with Hot Deal sales."
344,2020-08-10 21:02:40,i6pu5n,I am also going to borrow!

346,2020-08-12 02:53:34,i6pu5n,"The last I heard, which was months ago, was before the end of this year."
347,2020-08-10 17:39:18,i6pu5n,"> e you've played MD 2, do you think its the type of game you'd enjoy doing a campaign of? Or only good for 1 shot games. I'm kinda back and worth on that $45 campaign expansion.

maybe it's worth it? I'm a little biased as I like a long gloomhaven campaign where you get minor upgrades until you finally realize you're a lot more powerful, or a scenario based campaign with good story. 

It feels weird they're talking about remixing scenarios from the main box, and I don't feel like it's going to feel satisfying to slow down everything in md2 to try and emulate an actual full length campaign in such a short amount of missions. 

I think it's a solid maybe? The horseman pack with an alternate 5 end game scenarios where you face them all as a final boss sounds better than 4 new roaming monsters. But then you're at $75 for 1.5 campaigns. But I'm personally not excited for it unless it hits $30 at retail."
348,2020-08-10 17:51:46,i6pu5n,"man, if MD2 ends up with two additional fully developed alternate game modes including pvp, scenery minis, an additional campaign expansion, extra tiles, 90 extra figures, a half dozen boss fights...

Yeah instant back, just like bloodborne.

I'm reallllly not seeing anything like that here, and it only seems like a good deal if you kept all your massive darkness 1 stuff and get a reason to play a game with it with the upgrade cards."
349,2020-08-09 21:35:38,i6pu5n,"I'm a backer (currently at least), but I don't get the Michael mini.  The top part with the goose is so flat, like a picture rather than a 3D sculpt and the bottom part is all cloak.  The pose is kinda strange.   Compared to some of the big boss minis like the Cliffbreaker Cyclops (MD1) or the Abominarat (Black Plague) its not doing it for me as a centrepiece mini.

I do like some of the other MD2 ones though.  Rafael is good."
350,2020-08-09 22:22:31,i6pu5n,"The problem with Petrichor for me is that the game is surprisingly fiddly. The theme, while pretty is also in some areas very disconnected from the gameplay, to the point that it actually complicates the rules.

It's not a bad game, but I was disappointed that it wasn't the lightweight game I thought it would be."
351,2020-08-10 00:02:06,i6pu5n,"I guess it makes the game that much faster and they've added new role cards to supplement the change in mechanics and round structure     
     
Personally I'm down to try Quest having burnt out of Avalon ages ago"
352,2020-08-10 00:08:59,i6pu5n,"I think they intended to create the same effect with special powers that specifically make people vote the quest a particular way rather than by voting itself (one good role specifically always has to hope the quest fails).

By doing that i think it fixes one of my major criticisms, that voting patterns become meta for particular groups (everyone always votes no on the first round of voting in my group, for example)."
353,2020-08-10 17:10:12,i6pu5n,"It's a shame they're not selling Coup separately, because it's one of my favourite games and I love the art work. But it looks like you can only get it with the most expensive bundle, but not interested in getting the rest."
354,2020-08-11 00:10:08,i6pu5n,FYI I read somewhere that there will be an umbrella academy minis game coming out soon. Maybe look into that too before making a final call.
355,2020-08-09 21:32:58,i6pu5n,"Can you name some? Not trying to be hyperbolic, just legitimately curious. 

What other new sources would you recommend?"
356,2020-08-09 22:38:36,i6pu5n,"I havent bought any significant games in retail in 7 or 8 years and have backed 100s of kickstarters in that time.  I think your statement that they are missing out comes from a position of ignorance on whats available on kickstarter.

There are plenty of great games in both sales channels."
357,2020-08-10 00:10:17,i6pu5n,"To add to that, many of the components that were initially delivered for **Reavers of Midgard** were of lower quality or damaged upon delivery.  The initial GameTrayz insert was so thin that rubber bands used to hold things together cut into it.  I had to request replacement parts twice because I had many damaged cards and a damaged board and even the first set of replacements had damage. 

The insert was eventually replaced, but only because GreyFox was able to get their manufacturer to pay for it."
358,2020-08-10 23:06:34,i6pu5n,"I don’t see P&P as adequate for anything at all.  Here’s the $40 level:

>Get a copy of the core set, 63-card Crypt pack for customization, and the neonate level stretch goals. 

So what are you saying this is missing?  

It’s a complete core (unlike FFG who doesn’t give you full playsets) and the price is in line with similar products at launch.  

And it comes with extras. Plus, it’s Renegade, who has made plenty of quality games with cards before. The $100 level just blings it out (sleeves, playmats, etc). I don’t feel like they watered down the core box at all in order to have a $100 level too. Rather, I think they did a nice job adding extras that someone might *want* to hit the $100 level without making you feel like you're missing out if you don't want to spend.

This type of game might not be your thing. I don't know. But I like the value proposition of a well-produced and well-supported ECG, especially as other games I like continue to price players out (Double Masters...groan...) or find ways to unnecessarily milk their playerbase while simultaneously saturating the market (any FFG game)."
359,2020-08-10 18:07:50,i6pu5n,Yeah I'm leaning towards getting just the core and the horseman pack. I got frosthaven coming so that's more than enough campaign fill there. Lol
360,2020-08-10 19:16:50,i6pu5n,"My guess would be something like the following extras:

* 10 Heroes (6 other gender base classes + 2x2 new classes)
* 49 Mobs (7 Extra Mob types with 6 base + 1 Leader each)
* 5 Roaming Monsters
* 1 Boss (maybe 2 if we're lucky)
* Some extras like the Shaman Spirits"
361,2020-08-09 23:01:54,i6pu5n,"Did you play with just the base game or with expansions as well?

I certainly get that complexity vibe from some of the expansions, I watched a video of someone explaining how the cows work and it sounded a bit fiddly. Also some of the plants seem have several stages of transition which might be hard for people to pick up quickly.

From the base game though it seems like you can just fly clouds around and drop water on things."
362,2020-08-11 00:52:07,i6pu5n,"Ohhh, that is good to know!"
363,2020-08-10 00:00:25,i6pu5n,I'd like to +1 to this question too... as I'd love to expand my news sources. Zelbinian does the work of an angel.~
364,2020-08-10 01:00:58,i6pu5n,"I usually look at BGG.  They've got their ""hotness track"" and the gone cardboard forum can tell you what just came out. 

There are also a handful of folks that do videos on anticipated games that would normally get released at a convention (like GenCon) but I don't really follow them to say how good they are. I know Pair of Dice Paradise did some but, like I said, I don't follow them to know if they do them all the time. 

You can also check out podcasts like Brain Games or Blue Peg Pink Peg and they usually have a news segment."
365,2020-08-10 00:48:51,i6pu5n,"This year you have Fort, Pandemic Legacy Season 0, Undaunted North Africa, and Gloomhaven Jaws of the Lion, to name a few."
366,2020-08-10 18:21:25,i6pu5n,"core box gloomhaven (+pnp solo scenarios and the community scenarios) has roughly 500 hours of set up/play time in there, so... that's a safe bet."
367,2020-08-09 23:45:14,i6pu5n,"It was quite a while since I last played it, but I think my biggest gripe was with the whole voting mechanic. Every turn after playing a card, you also have to vote on the next season by placing a marker on circular board matching the card you played or the adjacent season. The *two* most voted seasons are then triggered at the start of the next round, which have their own unique effect on the board. 

The players that have the most votes on one of the two winning seasons then gains a certain number of victory points at the end of the game depending on how many times that player had won the season vote.

As an alternative to voting, a player can also choose to decrease the value of one of the three harvest dies that were rolled in the beginning of the game. If all three reaches 0, they trigger a harvest phase where you resolve the board into victory points and reroll the dies.

I think the game would have been better if they had designed without the voting mechanic or at least streamlined it. What's worse is that the art and theme does very little in guiding the players into what they are supposed to do each turn and what the effects will be.

It all probably really depends on your expectations of the game. I hoped for something like Splendor with a better theme, but instead it turned out to be closer to e.g. Brass in complexity."
368,2020-08-10 01:09:11,i6pu5n,"Those are giant releases that if you casually browse the subreddit or are on the bgg facebook page you probably know about. But great games, nonetheless."
369,2020-08-10 00:05:38,i6pu5n,"Interesting, thanks for the write up. I forgot about the whole voting phase thing.

It sounds like something you need to play a few times to get the hang of, which can be good or bad depending on what you are looking for!

I picked up cytosis recently, that's a pretty good worker placement game with a unique theme. Only played it once so far, but its pretty easy to pick up and play. It sounds like petricore will require a bit more time investment to get the most fun out of it."
370,2020-08-10 01:10:59,i6pu5n,"I mean, yes, that's the point. They were asking for some good boardgames released via retail and I listed some."
371,2020-08-10 01:17:46,i6pu5n,"I just meant I figured their intention for asking was about smaller game releases that get missed over large kickstarters or kickstarter adjacent games. The ones listed I think fall into the latter category, mostly, or at least get more coverage then most other games released lately."
372,2020-08-08 18:47:22,i61j0k,"Green in first is a bold prediction. I think they are underrated, but the highest I see them going is third, as pink and cyan are both really good."
373,2020-08-08 20:10:38,i61j0k,"I don’t get how people forget it’s not all points based the top two have to fight in dodge ball, pink parrots will destroy in dodge ball if they get there"
374,2020-08-08 17:33:04,i61j0k,"I respect you’re opinion. 

I feel like Shubble isn’t going to carry the Orange Ocelots that hard and at best Yellow Yaks are all atleast ok so I would put Yellow above Orange."

376,2020-08-08 23:56:55,i61j0k,The only team in my eyes that can take pink (in dodgeball) is aqua as both quig and hbomb.Because both  are very good at it
377,2020-08-10 19:08:02,i61j0k,TapL is a wildcard; he's the deciding factor on them making top 2 or not

379,2020-08-09 10:16:48,i61j0k,From what i hear techno has been practicing dodgebolt for weeks. If you watch last event you can see how every dodgebolt round he instantly kills Pete. And with dream there too I think the only way they could lose it is if someone choked hard
380,2020-08-09 17:05:16,i61j0k,"Yeah,they will probably do the same thing  if they get to the finals.Focusing on the best/bests players on the other team like TapL or cyan on quig and hbomb on aqua"
381,2020-08-09 22:48:49,i61j0k,Yeah the only reason they lost was because Ph1lza and Wilbur left HBomb for last

386,2020-08-08 13:07:29,i5wla1,The thing about pink that might not work is that they wont have the teammates to execute those plans or strats. Like micheal and burren are good dont get me wrong but with micheal on vacation he might only have like two days to practice and learn the strats or plans with his team. Also in mcc7 dream and techno wouldn't have done so well in those games without there teammates like burren and Michael dont really compare to sapnap and george or Phil and wilbur.
387,2020-08-08 15:13:39,i5wla1,"I kinda could see Red Rabbits getting Top 5. 

Phil's not techno but he's still a decently good player, I'd consider him just below Fundy. Wilbur's been getting significantly better with each MCC, as we saw during Battle Box in MCC7 and Foot Race in MCC6. Idk shit about SMajor so maybe he'll drag the team WAY down but I don't see them in 8th place with 2 higher tier players like Tommy and Phil"

Wilbur and Scott combined are about as good as Sparklez and Puffy so technically this team has a chance at top 2, but still unlikely because the teams are more competitive"

397,2020-08-08 15:56:11,i5wla1,philza is consistently good. It relies on Tommy because their performance depends on whether *he* specifically tries or not
398,2020-08-08 13:32:20,i5wla1,Burren shoudnt be underestimated. but im mostly worried about michael. but my point was that dream would be sharing his strategies and same for techno and then they basicly have a strat for every game which is really good since no other team really has that. i think burren and michael should atleast get top 20 with the help of techno and dream
399,2020-08-08 13:35:48,i5wla1,"true but dream and techno are definitely training like crazy so they will carry the team hard but only if they choose the right games so they are gonna have to choose mostly solo games like parkour warrior,ace race etc. and im guessing eret and burren can adapt pretty well since everyone is saying,""dont underestimate them""(this is just an assumption) so despite the dilemmas that you have mentioned they have a really high chance of winning"

401,2020-08-08 15:58:18,i5wla1,for my list I had them 2nd winning dodge bolt but I took down the post cause of where I put Pete's team in 8th and I got some hate
402,2020-08-11 07:42:51,i5wla1,im not sleeping on callvin. its mostly minimuka that is bringing down the team and that SB737 is new so id put him as a top 20 player and seapeekay isnt a top 10 consistently while 5th team fundy and krinios are too amazing consistent top 10 players.
403,2020-08-11 07:35:10,i5wla1,youre a bit crazy. there not bad but still there are too many better teams
404,2020-08-08 13:34:58,i5wla1,Glad we have almost the same standings! i was thinking of putting green a bit lower but decided no to. and unless quig and hbomb pull a 1st and 2nd like pete and hbomb dont really think they will get first but yeah
405,2020-08-09 01:54:13,i5wla1,"I mean I agree with a lot that you said but seing fundys vod from last mcc hes not realy a morale booster nor team player,he was VERY competitive and sometimes(on battle box) he would be kinda mean to plumbella while on mute"
406,2020-08-11 07:36:42,i5wla1,im mostly worried about sylvee since she placed around top 30 with the practice with dream team and the carry of the dream team
407,2020-08-11 07:39:03,i5wla1,if youre rooting for orange ocelots why do you have pink parrots as your flair huh? i think youre glad that i put pink at first lol
408,2020-08-08 18:13:07,i5wla1,dream and techno know people have such high exspections so they will probably train like crazy and hopefully don't disappoint
409,2020-08-08 13:28:05,i5wla1,Yeah thats true.
410,2020-08-12 02:22:44,i5wla1,"Tbh I think the last time he really tried was with Phil and he tried the hardest in mcc2 when he got second, the only other time he didn't try with Phil on his team was mcc3 where he got 9th"
411,2020-08-11 07:48:10,i5wla1,I mean you do you but the point is I definitely don't see Red Rabbits being that low
412,2020-08-09 03:53:26,i5wla1,"Ah I wasn’t aware of this. He is friends with krinios though so hopefully he’ll tone down a bit? Maybe he was just kind of stressed, I always thought fundy was a nice dude."
413,2020-08-11 07:47:44,i5wla1,No that was a joke-
414,2020-08-11 07:37:37,i5wla1,very true
415,2020-08-11 08:43:58,i5wla1,yeah but its too hard to decide
416,2020-08-09 03:59:18,i5wla1,Idk.I haven’t watched his vod from week 6 so idk if his actualy like this all the time or if he acts like that only when his on bad teams or with bad teamates
417,2020-08-09 04:16:14,i5wla1,"It is all for fun, but I could see his competitive side getting the best of him, especially if he’s used to being paired with teammates that match his competitiveness."
418,2020-08-09 04:17:02,i5wla1,Well we’re all hoping for the best!
419,2020-08-02 05:49:03,i24tho,Wilbur is quickly becoming top 20 easy I love Phil but I’d move him lower to like 12. I feel like Scott and Seapeekay are good but I don’t think they’re on the level of B tier. Honestly Tommy has the capabilities of being an insane player he got like 3.6k in the second or third which is insane especially for that time but he hasn’t been taking it seriously really so I’d put him at like 16. Also underrating Burren and Micheal in my opinion as well as puffy
420,2020-08-02 18:14:30,i24tho,crazy that people put fundy under dream but he’s outperformed him both events no???
421,2020-08-02 10:56:07,i24tho,I feel like putting shubble at 28 is underating her
422,2020-08-02 11:11:22,i24tho,"Other than a few people here and there, I'd say this is a pretty accurate tier list"
423,2020-08-02 14:57:25,i24tho,i'd say techno (he has half the records ) infront of quig and dream (hasn't got to the finals yet then he will be in S  ) in A tier
424,2020-08-04 08:52:07,i24tho,Reddit still sleeping on sb737 man
425,2020-08-02 02:47:45,i24tho,I fully agree except i would move puffy up a little bit
426,2020-08-02 15:46:33,i24tho,YOU DID NOT JUST PUT SB IN C TIER
427,2020-08-02 20:47:59,i24tho,Where would fruitberries be in this
428,2020-08-03 08:31:49,i24tho,Calvin needs to be S tier as he is very good but does not get the recognition
429,2020-08-04 00:41:29,i24tho,"Honestly I think if Calvin gets a strong team like he does now, he can show how much of a complete God he is at Minecraft. Hopefully he’ll be in alot more S tiers after the event."
430,2020-08-05 11:21:34,i24tho,iI Was hoping Eret would be in B tier atleast : ( he was i the winning team last season and did really good.
431,2020-08-02 04:51:49,i24tho,"I don’t think Phil is A tier, captain sparklez has just been better"
432,2020-08-02 18:20:21,i24tho,Dream had more points in both events
433,2020-08-02 14:58:00,i24tho,"she has won twice , even if she was carried that takes some skill"
434,2020-08-04 22:11:00,i24tho,I dont think techno is better than quig. Quig has placed 1st individual twice and has also won twice while techno has only placed 1st once and only won once. Quig has also been top 5 in games 29 times and techno 24 times.
435,2020-08-02 02:55:25,i24tho,I felt weird putting her at 22 but I really think everyone above her is better except maybe Kara
436,2020-08-02 06:27:06,i24tho,"puffy, someone said had the lowest placement in any mcc winning team tho. IK she placed top10 last time a large part of that was getting hers, micheal,and burren’s SoT coins combined which is the reason why they are on pink parrots lol and also invisible tnt kills. She did pretty well in mcc7, but only rly had 4/8 good games and preformed well in the game that matter most, SoT."
437,2020-08-02 21:04:04,i24tho,"I’m glad you asked, I would probably put him at 6"
438,2020-08-02 05:03:14,i24tho,"Ph1lza outscored Captain in 4 of the 6 MCC's they have both been in and has a higher average score.

Also on this chart Ph1l is a low A and Captain is a High B so they are pretty dang close here."
439,2020-08-02 19:33:26,i24tho,turns out i was wrong! but tbf not by much! haha my b
440,2020-08-03 15:54:17,i24tho,And she did win a 2v1 DodgeBolt
441,2020-08-04 22:30:14,i24tho,i'd say techno has alot more records because when he plays HE PLAYS
442,2020-08-02 03:04:04,i24tho,True. It also feels weird to me for her to be 22nd because she is so underrated and pretty good but there are a bunch of good players this mcc
443,2020-08-02 05:15:34,i24tho,"But, Phil has done that in the earlier mcc’s and has always played on the better team, but I can see your point here"
444,2020-08-02 19:41:51,i24tho,"All good, but I do agree Fundy is underrated"
445,2020-08-03 16:32:14,i24tho,she isnt S but atleast B
446,2020-07-31 16:34:00,i1adly,"“long lost Scottish cousin” I’m dying. But they seriously are under appreciating Mefs and I’d say Cyan has the best chance of winning, though my hopes are still with Pete"
447,2020-07-31 16:37:14,i1adly,I dont know I feel like quig and h could end up much higher  than 5 but overall i think the ratings are good
448,2020-07-31 17:50:34,i1adly," Red Rabbits could get to even top 4 imo. Ppl underestimate Tommy's skill, imo he is almost as good as techno and dream when he isn't throwing, and imo he won't this time because of will and phill, but I'm not sure because there is no techno so he probably won't try so hard to prove his skills but still...

Also, I think Blue Bats are too high on the list, yeah Calvin is an absolute beast, and Seapeekay is really good cause of all the training but I don't think they could carry the whole team, especially because SPK trained so hard and tryharded because of techno fans that gave him so much support, I think this time he is gonna play a bit more casual.

Idk about  SB737, I watched a few of his videos when they got in my recommended but as I said I don't know much about him and his skills, if he isn't above average player I don't see them in 3rd place.

And MiniMuka looks to me just like a type of guy that is there to have fun an doesn't care that much about the win, but if it's possible he will go for it. I know him mostly from JackSucksAtLife and from there he gave me that impression, and I never really saw him do that well in mccs, I see him as an average skilled player, so idk if this is enough for the 3rd place."
449,2020-07-31 19:41:25,i1adly,I wanna see this legendary audition from Cxlvxn. Got a link?
450,2020-07-31 21:20:10,i1adly,"The Green Guardians comment gave me a little bit of chills when you said they all work best with a leader to guide them, being George and Sapnap with Dream and Krtzy with Sparklez, Eret being tossed around good teams. But with that said I actually predict this team to be top 5/4 at least, because Krtzy individually gets top 10 almost every game, George and Sapnap obviously get compared to Dream's skill in their videos, but individually have grown with him and are pretty competent, and Eret overall results-wise is decent too (who won with the rest in mcc 7). 

I think next to Pink Parrots I'd watch Green Guardians just to see how well they'd come together as a team and toughen each other individually, they got some good potential in front of them."
451,2020-07-31 21:36:18,i1adly,">Tommy, Wil, and Phil have that great younger brother older brother and dad dynamic, adding Scott as the long lost Scottish cousin just makes this more fun.

I don't know why I found this so funny"
452,2020-07-31 22:36:52,i1adly,"I think you're underestimating Red Rabbits a bit. I can't speak for Scott and Wilbur cause I don't really know how they play, but Phil is an incredible player and Tommy is cracked when he's in the right mood

Besides that, I really like this post, your thoughts and analyses were fun to read, especially for the green guardians"

&#x200B;

Now that's a line I thought I'd never see."
455,2020-08-01 06:46:12,i1adly,"Very well thought out but I see slightly more hope for Green Guardians because of the fact that Sapnap is seriously a good player, he finished in like the top 15th in every game last MCC except Rocket Spleef (he got 38th) and if Rocket Spleef is missed or Sapnap/George get the hang of it this team in sheer skill could go up 1, 2 or maybe 3 places. Its also interesting to note that Blue Bats in MCC6 didn't have a leader either but their chill agreeing vibe helped them through, however this didn't help for Cyan Creepers of MCC7 so I dunno. Krtzy's also placed top 10 every MCC he's been minus the last one (mainly because he was sand guy in SoT) so he's a competent player to look out for too. I agree this team is more likely to be placed lower (with the potential to win) but I feel they can move up maybe 1 or 2 places than 8th. Because Eret's also performed best with Pete, but Eret also kinda knows George and Sapnap from the Dream SMP so its anyone's guess."
456,2020-08-09 16:09:11,i1adly,"bro you are SLEEPING on green guardians, krtzyy is honestly one of the best players in MCC, sap is quite good, and the other two are also quite good. They don't need a leader (which to you seems like it just means more popular)."
457,2020-07-31 18:10:43,i1adly,"I mean statistically Dream and Techno (AS A DUO) are better than Vikk and Pete (AS A DUO), and Green guardians MCC4 with Burren Michael Vikk and Pete made it into the finals, but barely. I think Pink might actually get second place, it's not as OP as it seems to be."
458,2020-07-31 23:54:19,i1adly,Pete is great I mean I'm team Pete but I don't think he would mind if dodgebolt didn't have him in it
459,2020-07-31 21:14:56,i1adly,"bruh quig and hbomb on a team is almost the same thing as pete and hbomb on a team. This team is top 3 for sure, and I know smallishbeans and fwhip can do good with teammates like H and quig."

You could see him releasing all the adrenaline by jumping after he won. His young blood is what makes him one of the most ruthless competitors in MCC"
464,2020-08-02 05:48:34,i1adly,"I think if the gimmicky games are skipped (rocket spleef, build mart) this team would secure #1 as they're incredible when it comes to game sense. Having heightened PvP ability typically comes with some form of game sense so I at least predict TapL to be in the top half. Even then, we got Mefs! Easily the most underrated player give Mefs more credit!"
465,2020-07-31 23:04:48,i1adly,"I hope he confused Ren for False.

False has PvP skill, having been a co-winner of 4 editions of Hermitcraft UHC. I love Ren, but his main skill is building, otherwise he's really only in MCC for fun."
466,2020-08-02 05:46:06,i1adly,"I see that, for me personally seeing the roster for the team just underwhelmed me. Maybe I'm wrong though and Krtzzy and Sapnap will do loads I'll have to see. It's still a bit hard for me to weigh in a couple teams so I don't expect to be right and I can see why some would place some money on green"
467,2020-08-10 00:42:34,i1adly,"I didn't put this reasoning in the text but I actually think (please don't get mad) that George sometimes anti synergizes, especially in Manhunt. It's just my observation, but a couple of times Dream targets George solely because he split up from the group. As a solo player he's very competent especially with his 1 on 1 manhunts against Dream, but as a team player I've seen him think slightly too individualistic."

469,2020-08-01 06:48:11,i1adly,"I don't think Dream and Techno can even be considered better than Vik and Pete to be fair, so Pink Parrots are a reasonably balanced team. Sure they're stronger in PvP games (which are usually quite rng also), but Pete>Dream in most other games and Vik=Techno in the other stuff also."
470,2020-07-31 23:55:36,i1adly,I know. I have a feeling he likes seeing other people succeed more than he does himself. I remember in MCC 6 they were doing Parkour Warrior and Mefs was in first and Pete was like “I really hope he gets some good recognition for this”

-Coming out. FOOD VIDEOS AND DIYs ...we don't talk about this one

-The Bobby Burns thing..We're not talking about this failure either

-Conspiracy. DATING RYLAND. FRIENDSHIP WITH JEFFREE....You probably know what happened there.




Well thanks for those elaborate explanations."
496,2020-07-23 11:00:39,hwbkcl,"The reason it was wrong if him to do that whole offensive character thing was because it was supported. But he himself also supported it. What he did was glamorise and normalize racist behaviour to his audience of mostly still developing children. That is why it is wrong. Being racist, making money off of it, ""apologizing"" then STILL MAKING MONEY OFF OF IT.

People can change but his actions by still literally having merch of a racist character out there really prooves otherwise. Plus on his last apology he ticked sooo many boxes for text book manipulation."
497,2020-07-23 12:32:47,hwbkcl,"The 'we don't talk about that' parts were extremely unhelpful. Why leave out these bits cos they're cringey or a bit dark?The whole shitshow with Bobby is an interesting part of Shane's arc & shows both the good & bad in him. The food videos also speak to his effed up relationship with his body & food & also give insight into some of his poor choices in general.
Also, I'm old as dirt & remember folks DID have issues with some of the content back then. They just got buried under all the fangirl comments."
498,2020-07-23 11:03:40,hwbkcl,">

>**GARRET>** There was a moment where Shane announced starting a company with Garret and Andrew. They also announced fan merch - popsockets and t-shirts. They even bought a house for office purposes. Somehow nothing ever happened from there.

>**I believe that if he stuck to this plan, he would never start a business with Jeffree and would be at a different place RN./**

>\----------------------------
>

Shane and Garrett's company was for a YouTube Red show Shane was offered.

The first controversy hit and YouTube cancelled the contract.

The company dissolved because there was no more show for the company to produce.

Shane didn't really have a choice ""to continue on this path""

Also, they didn't buy a house to use as an office.   They rented it.  And it was an apartment.  They used it as an office for a while. And then Morgan moved into it."
499,2020-07-23 11:45:34,hwbkcl,"I think Shane never really grew up or matured in any shape or form. He was still doing problematic things all the way up untill 2016. He seems to cling onto whoever is popular at the time like Jefree star, Tana, Jake and shakes his persona and content to change for the times. He goes through friend after friend and nobody knows why. We can only guess. Most adults have stable friendships but for Shane his friendships last 3 years max if he’s lucky. It makes me question why he can’t hold unto a friend. I don’t think there’s redemption for him, especially after calling Tati a liar/manipulator over her sexual assault story. That was really gross. It showed he’s still the dramatic, immature and offensive person he used to be. That insta live showed a snippet of Shane’s true self and it was ugly. I couldn’t support him after that or defend him. Gross"
500,2020-07-23 13:22:54,hwbkcl,"There was a huge part of YouTube that did not find Shananay, his Shane Dawson TV series, or his general comedy funny at all back in the day. Myself included. We just didn't watch or comment. We watched things like Will It Microwave and TheMeanKitty (RIP) instead. 

I actually ended up subscribing to him during his milkshake/DIY/food eating phase, mainly because I could really relate to all his jokes about hating himself. But like... I had no clue? I watched two seconds of a Shananay video and was unimpressed. Clicked off and watched the Shaytards or something (whoo there's another can of worms). It's honestly only recently that I'm seeing exactly how many jokes he's made that are pretty disgusting. It's something I have to work on identifying faster.

Ramble aside, this list seems very opinionated and very incomplete."

503,2020-07-23 13:06:12,hwbkcl,"Shane had been talking to drew since drew was at least 13. He cast him in Not Cool because they were already “friends” (when Shane was an adult, mind you)"
504,2020-07-23 13:34:48,hwbkcl,"I personally think he’s severely emotionally stunted. He went straight from high school to being a full time YouTube comedian with a young audience. He never went through the normal life experiences which mature people and he very rarely would be properly held accountable for things. He hasn’t been a part of “the real world” for a decade and has spent all of his adult life online, that lifestyle does not lead to a well adjusted individual."
505,2020-07-23 16:52:19,hwbkcl,"I remember when Shane met Trisha (he was dating Lisa) and I thought back then that his friendship with Trish was a HUGE stress on his relationship with Lisa. Maybe it's just me? Their last videos together were so painful to watch, Lisa trying to make things seem normal and Shane was super mean to her and checked out. I felt horrible for Lisa."

Saying your post and opinion matter is kinda weird. Other than that, we know everything, we are aware and don’t accept that. Don’t try rationalize his behavior and be an apologist. I was on youtube that time, I don’t think it was so loveable and funny to tell these jokes. I guess when you are not attacked personally it’s funny :)))"
507,2020-07-23 14:38:48,hwbkcl,"I first watched a Shane Dawson video at least 11 years ago and I think a lot of people totally missed something important from that era, he's a fucking idiot raised by a crazy lady. I don't get why people love ""mama Dawson"" so much, she was clearly an iffy parent at best. The guy barely graduated high school and had basically no social life before YT. So very early on his only way of connecting with people and making any money was by being online and acting crazy. 



The coming out video was very exciting and for me but slightly scary because I think he didn't mean to come out that way. It really brought a lot of new more socially conscious people to his platform which was great! But he was clearly high on painkillers when he made the video if you rewatch it you will see exactly what I mean. He had broken his leg or something right before and was doped up.



The crazy food videos were also clearly a low point, Lisa had been the adult in the relationship and I would bet was helping him manage his finances because again, Shane is an idiot.




The spooky boys plus Trish era was interesting, but he was surrounded by people making almost all their money off him and honestly I think he got used to being surrounded by yes men who acted like all his opinions were great. 



I was initially really happy he was working with Jeffree, who is also crazy but seemed to have mostly dealt with his issues and was doing much better as well as the fact that he is clearly able to handle his own money and would be able to tell Shane when he was being an idiot. Clearly that is not how that worked out. I won't pretend to have a handle on the whole makeup scandal thing but to me it seems like Shane was incredibly jealous of James Charles because he's popular, beautiful, thin, young, and was able to get to be openly queer basically from the get go.  



Honestly Shane needs to invest some money so he doesn't need to be constantly making videos to be ok and either attend some sort of online program or just do some independent research on how things actually work in the world and what most people are dealing with because the guy has been removed from what most of us would consider reality since he was like 20."

512,2020-07-23 13:02:53,hwbkcl,"I really agree with what you said about Shane losing himself. He may well be interested in makeup and starting a brand but it feels very much like he saw how lavish J\*'s life was and fell into the trap of wanting to be like him, hence the makeup line. Has he actually done any looks or shown any interest in makeup after that was finished?

He's obviously been passionate about telling other people's stories/directing for at least 10 years so I'm kind of confused why his newer docuseries end up being focused on him or shilling a product instead of on the person he's filming. There was an obvious drop in quality between the Shane & friends vlogs and the Jake Paul/Tana/Eugenia series because of it. I think he realised the amount of clout he got from 'fixing' problematic people was greater than what he got from just making silly vlogs or conspiracy vids. 

If he were to ever make a comeback to Youtube, the only way IMO it would be appropriate would be as a cameraman or editor for someone else. He clearly cannot be the centre of attention without becoming arrogant and disconnected from his audience."

Still, Bobby wasn't a hater. He was just critical of YT's manipulative trends, which included a lot of the things Shane did."

It’s also right after Not Cool came out and it didn’t lead to the directing career he had hoped he’d would get.

Also, what about his podcast Shane and Friends? That pretty much runs parallel to a large portion of his career and that was more of an unadulterated side of himself. 

I do applaud OP for providing context in the beginning because as someone who found out about Shane in 2009, it’s very hard to put yourself back into that context. Unfortunately it just falls flat."

 I'll also try to edit the original post and add the information.

**-Coming out. FOOD VIDEOS AND DIYs ...we don't talk about this one**

It looks like after Shane shaved his head he went through a metamorphosis and a few months after breaking up with Lisa, he decided to upload his [coming out video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPdE3rbqf_Q). One year after that Shane started uploading food video & DIY series with little to no original content at all. None of them were engaging or interesting but were bearable to watch because of Shane's natural charm and sense of humor. 

This part of Shane's career felt like he was trying too hard to find a way of uploading regular content without putting much thought into it. During that time he was talking about quitting the platform quite often. Alexis G. Zall and Destery would keep uploading on the weekends' short videos in commentary style. It felt like Shane new he was making trash content but still, was joking about it instead of facing the case. He was also in touch with his ex-girlfriend and would also make collabs with her, joking and referencing the fact that he came out as bisexual. 

**-The Bobby Burns thing..We're not talking about this failure either**

I must admit I was very confused when I saw that Shane was deciding to create a series dedicated to his ""hater"" Bobby Burns. It was an original turn for him, but I didn't like the tone of the series. My own, personal opinion, is that he was trying too hard to publically receive admiration and acceptance from all of his haters, and bullies, ever, and decided to use Bobby Burns as a generalized image of people from his past.

What also confused me a lot is that Bobby's content wasn't as good as Shane's. It looked like they didn't have much in common - in terms of type of videos, humor, interests, etc. To this day I still can't explain to myself why Shane decided it was a good idea to give him a whole segment ""The Bobby Burns Show"". Long story short: It didn't last. Two or three videos were uploaded but they were kind of boring and generic -  buzzfeed-like cheesy style. A lot of dislikes and negative comments were also received. \*

\* *As of today, I can't even find those videos.*

**-Conspiracy.**

The conspiracy series first started as a single video by Shane, simply made because of pure interest. Over the years Shane talked a lot about his fascination with ""dark"" topics, conspiracies, and so on. It was relieving to see Shane again being passionate about something. And that's why one video was followed by another, and then... whole series. Shane was back on top and went trending FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS WHOLE CAREER. This clearly gave a green-light to Shane and he started investing more time in production and editing. He invited Andrew and started ""The Spooky Boys Series"" with Drew and Garret.

**Dating Ryland**

This was the first time Shane publically talked about dating a man. It had happened in the past over the last year, but he never mentioned it in front of a camera. It seemed like he started to feel more like himself. PERSONAL OBSERVATION: I, personally, started seeing a more feminine part of Shane. He was expressing his emotions more, he started wearing more makeup and trying out more girls' clothes, his voice changed (he referred to the voice in his past videos as a fake, alfa-male/hetero voice). Ryland helped him come out even more."

527,2020-07-23 21:46:14,hwbkcl,"I also feel like the description of the Not Cool and Dating Lisa phase is missing some relevant info too. His book (unless I'm getting confused I read it forever ago) talked about how severely he was battling his eating disorder during that time, so while I'm sure he was gaining confidence and whatever, he was also bingeing and throwing up his food."
528,2020-07-23 14:01:17,hwbkcl,I also remember people having a huge issue with Shanaynay. They were always just played off as ‘haters’ since the majority of people were obsessed with Shane. OP’s post seems very biased honestly which makes claiming their post as important kind of redundant
529,2020-07-23 18:15:45,hwbkcl,I agree. I’m really disappointed with the “we don’t talk about this it was a dark time” like wait what happened then?
530,2020-07-23 21:31:52,hwbkcl,This exactly
531,2020-07-23 22:21:37,hwbkcl,">I think Shane never really grew up or matured in any shape or form.

You notice it a lot with people who became famous really young. Money and constant praise can stunt people's growth because they feel like they have reached their peak and will never be more mature than how they are in that very moment.

Look at Tana, for example. She's now 22, but still acts like she's a 16 year old girl. She should be an adult, but her demeanor is that of a bratty, spoiled girl."
532,2020-07-24 03:11:24,hwbkcl,"If you said you're breaking point with him was finding out about something in his past that would make a lot more sense to me. But his reaction to Tati, although it shouldn't have been aired publicly, seems like a valid way to feel if someone is lying about you or painting themselves in a victim narrative when they were a willing participant in something. I dont know, of all the things people are mad at him for right now this one makes the least amount of sense to me. If I were in his position I would have probably been in a horrible head space as well."
533,2020-07-23 14:04:32,hwbkcl,I’m so out of the loop. I used to watch the shaytards a bit and then fully stopped years ago. What is a very quick summary of what’s wrong with them?
534,2020-07-23 22:36:38,hwbkcl,I was watching the vlog brothers at the time. I thought Shanaynay was terrible always.
535,2020-07-31 02:35:34,hwbkcl,"I was like this too. I was real young. I thought Shane Dawson was annoying and only started watching when a friend showed me him (they turned out to be shitty, ha) I was all about AVGN, Will it Blend, Ashens... 

Looking back now that friend used to rag on me for being poor and all kinds of other things and I think maybe this content had something to do with that"
536,2020-07-23 11:45:55,hwbkcl,As far as I know (correct me if I’m wrong) her and Shane fell out because she didn’t like being mocked for her race. She deleted her YouTube channel and has stayed relatively far from that scene for a while. I heard that now she has a partner and children!
537,2020-07-23 14:34:06,hwbkcl,I just watched something from an old friend from this era who exposed tf out of him. Said he was racist to shanna and brie was complicit. Bree apologized and agreed Shane was a horrible friend 😳 very interesting
538,2020-07-23 21:34:09,hwbkcl,RIGHT?? This whole post is a biased mess
539,2020-07-26 23:18:16,hwbkcl,"Well its kinda true. Especially if you are a mirror person, a more feminine boyfriend might boost your feminine side. (or more masculine straight friends might do the opposite) Its normal in many situations actually."
540,2020-08-30 20:25:57,hwbkcl,"It was likely because they had broken up by then? They put on this fake persona that they were still together ""for the fans"" or something, which is weird af imo. I never saw anything where Shane was mean to her (I didn't watch him during that era) but I've wondered about it since he's mean to almost... Everyone else in his life? And there's a video by Cid in which Lisa is openly scared of Him, as is Joey. It's for a split second, but it's there."
541,2020-07-23 14:00:14,hwbkcl,"I think there are two points in the argument that invalidated the thesis for me -- racism being discounted as stereotypes and the weird homophobic ""Shane turned more feminine when he started dating Ryland, it's what happens in gay relationships"" comment.  

OP, the context here is that Shane was making ""taboo"" content that were still hurtful and offensive to many people but largely ignored because racist content was heralded as edgy content. 

Blackface, this Shanaynay character have NEVER been acceptable. When white people tell you they didn't know that blackface was racist, it's because they chose to ignore the reasons why. 

And for your internalized homophobia, when a man enters a relationship with another man, the man is still a man and doesn't devalue his masculinity."
542,2020-07-24 22:56:22,hwbkcl,"Ya, especially when there’s majorly unhelpful ‘we don’t talk about this era’ gaps within it. It can’t be important if you’re glazing over that much info."

544,2020-07-24 20:03:38,hwbkcl,"They're both problematic (to put it lightly) and he definitely got influenced by his mother, a \*lot\*.

546,2020-07-23 18:18:10,hwbkcl,He’s made some mistakes but he’s participated in a TON of charities and raised a lot of money for BLM. The things he did and said weren’t okay at all. But I genuinely believe Felix learned from that harsh slap on the face and has bettered himself. And he absolutely adores his wife.

Did the mainstream media tell you that?"
548,2020-07-23 12:26:18,hwbkcl,"Value dissonance, some things don't age well and even when Shane was making that content he did have detractors who called him out for being racist but he dismissed them as haters. I also think a lot of his audience was young kids who didn't know any better at the time and now that they have grown up they see the content for what it is."
549,2020-07-23 21:58:15,hwbkcl,"It was always bad, but he had so many fans that just spoke over everyone and called them haters. And now white people are finally educating themselves and realizing this shit is offensive so more people are finally listening. The whole Shanaynay character made life hell for so many black girls, even me and a light skinned black person."
550,2020-07-23 12:26:21,hwbkcl,"I think it because shanaynay and all the other characters type of comedy was centered for that era of people and that era of thinking as the post said, on whats funny and whats offensive, but since our way of thinking changed and how society viewed comendy it became offensive persei"
551,2020-07-24 08:31:31,hwbkcl,"The truth of the matter is it was ok back then because people liked it, and people still do today its just that they don't dare to talk about it in public. Comedy that relies on making fun of people will always offend and when the group that is the butt of the joke gets enough influence and power over public discourse, the jokes are no longer funny. There are plenty of people decrying racist/sexist jokes today who will openly enjoy so called ""dark comedy"" or ""edgy jokes"" which is basically the same formula but instead of black people/women being victimized, it could be fat people, or ugly people, or clumsy people or even disabled people. When you lay it bare like this they'll deny it, but the hard truth is that mocking people will never go out of style, it's just a matter of who is the acceptable victim."

Shanaynay was ""black"" in the way all the stereotypes of black people and things would be highlighted in her behaviour. The fact he didnt directly put on blackface *which for the record he did for multiple other characters* dosen't change that. There was a girl here a while back saying how her friendgroup of mostly white girls would make her play Shanaynay cause she was Black and Actually started to make her feel like a stereotype... Its just promoting racist stereotypes regardless of if the intention was to be ""harmless"" or ""funny"""

565,2020-07-24 03:32:06,hwbkcl,"I don't want to invalidate your feelings on the situation but maybe I can give another perspective on ""white people not knowing black face is racist"" its not because they choose to ignore it. 

I know that might sound insane, but a lot of people dont even know what black face is, let alone know that it is offensive. I have had to explain to white people in their 50s what black face is. We didnt learn about it in school, and when parents arent informed about it you dont learn it at home either. So when you see someone paint their face darker, it can seem the same to a white person as a man putting on a long blonde wig and pretending to be a girl character. It is easy to view it as ""dressing up as a character"" when you have never been educated on the issue, never informed about the history, and have never lived a single day being black. I myself never knew what it was, and when I saw it I could not identify what it was or that it was deeply wrong. Now having more lived experience and access to information the generations before us were not exposed to as much, I have become much more aware. The bottom line of it is that white people have to learn about racism, unfortunately black people do not have the luxury of learning about it to know it's still happening because they experience it first hand. In school it is always taught in a historical context, which is a disservice to us all, we shouldn't have to try and fit the pieces together as we grow to learn about it. This is especially a problem in very white areas where people are not exposed to the reality of the situation until way too late in life."
566,2020-07-25 20:43:38,hwbkcl,I just wanna throw the notion I was 10 years old and didn’t really understand any of the jokes he made and why they hurt people. I was ignorant for sure but I can’t hate myself for being a kid who watched his content and NEVER applied that behavior to real life.

570,2020-07-23 22:41:51,hwbkcl,"Comedy in general ages *horribly*, because most of the time it relies way too much on lazy ways to make as much money as possible. There are comedies that criticize the society of the time that are still enjoyable, but many of the TV series and movies whose purpose was to simply ""make people laugh"" are just awful.

We need to remember that there was a lot of dehumanization of certain categories of people for *many* years, and that it was only natural that this way of thinking was assimilated into comedy. There are plenty of movies that make fun of fat people, trans women (trans men are usually never there), abused husbands, lesbians who are turned straight by the right man, straight guys who pretend to be gay to get into a girl's pants.

Then, with the modern times, we learned that that way of thinking doesn't make any sense and the comedies that rely on it aren't funny because they just make fun of people and are generally cruel."

573,2020-07-23 21:05:06,hwbkcl,Shanaynay wasn't just coded. Recently a Shanaynay video resurfaced where she claims to be light skinned - a term specifically used for lighter-toned and white-passing black women.

Shane had no problem using blackface , don’t u think he would’ve made her blackface if she was black?

Shanaynay was making fun of white people who act “ghetto” not of black people 

Just stop reaching sis"
576,2020-07-23 15:53:22,hwbkcl,"She isn’t black.. if she was black Shane would’ve used blackface to show us she was ...

578,2020-07-24 19:39:14,hwbkcl,"Okay I can understand that. I still see it differently, because when  you feel you're being attacked or lied about to millions of people and you're not able to tell the story or clear your name you're not really in a position to empathize with that person, you're blinded by your own life crumbling around you. But even though I disagree, I understand your point of view more now."
579,2020-07-24 00:53:31,hwbkcl,[here’s a video on it ](https://youtu.be/eQrAZC40sdo)
580,2020-07-23 16:09:35,hwbkcl,"TY. This just reads as a Shane apologist because they turn their nose against racism, their own homophobia and completely negates the fact that Shane made the autonomous decisions to portray/convey deeply racist, misogynist, and pedophilic characters and ideas as a public figure for YEARS. 

When he got demonetized, it was then he deleted the Shanaynay vids. He sold Shanaynay merch until this point, so he was profiting off of racism for all this time. OP also completely glosses over the pedophilic remarks with the one offhand bullet that Shane met Drew when Drew was a teen. 

I am Shane's age (\~early 30s) but I am a late adopter to YT (\~2 years.) I never watched American Pie and I did like Jersey Shore. The biggest things I can say to these irrelevant examples is that Jersey Shore stayed in its lane by satirizing the promiscuous, drunken Jersey girl/guy lifestyle (by portraying exaggerated versions of themselves); it premiered in 2009 and was considered a cultural phenomenon.  American Pie, I don't get why this is relevant. It premiered in 1999. Wasn't it about a group of white teenagers trying to lose their virginity? How is this applicable to Shane's egregious behavior?"
581,2020-07-24 03:49:32,hwbkcl,"Blackface is just a very small piece of the puzzle that encompasses racism against Black people. And that applies to Shane. I didn't watch the Shanaynay videos but I have seen clips in drama videos. Doesn't he also say the N word, play other racist stereotypes, and do other racist things?

Just because you and other people don't know what blackface is or the definition, doesn't negate the racism. 

And for the record, we are all speculating if Shane is a racist at heart. We will never know the truth to that. However, he is a public figure who has been depicted as playing and saying harmful racist characters and comments that he did not apologize for, redeem himself for, etc., until he was demonetized from his biggest (speculation) money source."
582,2020-07-24 18:21:14,hwbkcl,"I find this *extremely* hard to believe. If you’re an American, you know blackface is wrong and you know why. I grew up in the 90s and in 1993 for black history month IN GRADE SCHOOL we were were supposed to do reports on famous black people and dress up as them while giving the report. My class was almost entirely white kids. We were EXPLICITLY told NOT to wear make up or do anything to darken our skin and the history behind why this was offensive was explained to us. In **1993**. We were in the 2nd grade, I believe. Not one of my classmates had an issue following this rule. I was MLK and I wore a suit. Another kid was Michael Jordan and wore a basketball jersey. We understood why painting our faces to make us “look black” would have been offensive. No one did it. A bunch of fucking 8 year olds were able to comprehend the implications behind blackface and still **dress up as famous black people and respectful portray them**.  

There is no excuse."
583,2020-08-08 17:23:47,hwbkcl,"That’s not it at all if you actually looked at everything else I’ve said. Unlike these beauty gurus when Felix apologizes he doesn’t make it about him being attacked. He’s honest and owns up to it. If you haven’t actually watched his videos or seen his transformation then you can’t really comment. You’re simply trusting what you’ve heard. There’s also been analysis’ done that literally psychologically PROVE Felix isn’t anti-semitist in ANY way. 

I can’t comment on the n-word thing because it wasn’t okay and I still don’t know why in hell he said that. But you should really actually take a look at how he speaks and how he talks about others. There’s a REASON why he’s known as the king of YouTube and has such a big following. Please take the time to look a bit deeper into him as a person, and look at some of the wonderful things he’s done. Of course he’s said a terrible word. But unlike Jeffree Star you can ACTUALLY witness the change and sincerity.

Whereas Jeffree’s apologies have all this Gucci clothes and he says how people like to start drama and he’s in a dark place.

Felix sits down and is honest and transparent with his viewers. He doesn’t promote his merch or try to excuse his behavior. He sits down, admits it, promises to do better, and then keeps to that promise.

Also notice that the gaming community is a MUCH less toxic place than the beauty community by a MASSIVE stretch. And I think that says a lot."
584,2020-07-25 05:23:42,hwbkcl,Then I don't know how you came to the totally-not-influenced conclusion you did.
585,2020-07-24 20:42:40,hwbkcl,"A lot of it was also part of the pushback against ""political correctness"" and how it was supposedly stifling free speech/freedom of expression and all that.

And, in the early days of YouTube, it was heavily marketed as the place where you could say and do things that otherwise wouldn't be allowed on TV and get away with it. So it's no wonder that it became a sort of springboard for ""edgy"" comedy."
586,2020-07-24 03:38:49,hwbkcl,What did that person say? Lol
587,2020-07-23 21:07:25,hwbkcl,Yeah maybe that's the think i cant remember. Idk why its fuzzy like im blacking out Shane's content out of shame and disgust that i ever supported him.
588,2020-07-24 03:01:06,hwbkcl,"Yes she claimed to be light skinned. She also claimed her name was Shanaynay. But she was a white girl named Linda Johnson. She is the stereotypical white girl who pretends she is black, whoa vicky is a great example of these people who really exist. She would get very offended when people called her white, she was delusional but not black."
589,2020-07-23 12:30:07,hwbkcl,"I remember a sketch specifically someone saying some form of slur adjacent word just in a sentence at her and she was like "" what did you call me"" so the character was intended to be ""coded black"" but not explicitly stated."
590,2020-07-23 21:03:37,hwbkcl,"I remember seeing a video where she claimed to be ""light skinned."" That is a term specifically for black people who have lighter tones or who are white-passing. So, yeah, the character herself claimed to be a white-passing black woman.

591,2020-07-23 16:00:52,hwbkcl,Dark foundation a racist character does not make. As i said she was coded black and poor. Y'all really only dig to the surface.

593,2020-07-25 20:38:30,hwbkcl,"I wanna say first that I’m NOT shaming Tati for her sexual trauma because nobody deserves that and she has my upmost respect. However, in a video where she is supposed to be taking accountability and saying what she did wrong, it doesn’t look good to talk about things that may inspire sympathy. In other words in a video where she should have come forward and admitted she messed up and made that video that hurt someone, she was also mentioning she was also hurt which I feel minimizes the point of the video. Because she just shifted blame and never actually admitted to anything accept being manipulated."
594,2020-07-23 21:47:36,hwbkcl,"I was a YouTube teen, I was Shane's prime audience back in 2010. I never found him funny, he was always offensive and i didnt care for racist, sexist, and homophobic content. I wat hed a lot of charlieissocoollike, the vlogbrothers, and the british youtubers (who ended up being a mess, but I still follow zoella)."
595,2020-07-23 21:58:43,hwbkcl,"I came here to say the same thing about American Pie—it started almost 10 years before Shane's channel did, as far as I know. The movies mentioned also were rated R, and while I'm sure younger audiences were watching them anyway (myself included at the time) it would probably be at least a bit harder for some of Shane's youngest fans to watch them than it would be to watch his sketches on Youtube."
596,2020-07-24 04:05:10,hwbkcl,"I was just giving a different perspective, not even neccesarily about Shane, just white people in general. Having ignorance to black face does not make it okay, but I think that intentions matter (this goes for people who do it and also for people who see it and do nothing about it). I obviously do not know Shane's heart but I was speaking to your line about white people in general saying they didnt know black face was racist. I think not knowing is valid, as a person who didnt know myself. I didnt make black face but I was certainly complicit when I saw others doing it because I didnt know what black face was or what I was witnessing was wrong.

I just thought I'd shed a different perspective on it that I haven't seen people talking about. I think people dont talk about it because black people cant speak to the white experience and white people are afraid to admit their own ignorance for fear of seeming like a bad person, which is a huge part of the problem. Not admitting to being ignorant on these topics just feeds the fire when we should be addressing why we didnt know and making sure the same isnt true for future generations. I don't belive that ignorance equals racism, but I do belive that not admitting to past ignorance encourages the cycle to continue."
597,2020-07-24 20:01:32,hwbkcl,"Wow that sounds like you went to a school with an awesome teacher. And I'm happy you had that experience, but it does not mean that my experience, or the experience of so many others does not exist and isnt a problem. 

My very white schools black history month looked nothing like that, we learned about racism in a historical context as though it wasnt still happening, and black face was never once talked about. You say there's no excuse but how can you blame someone for not knowing something exists? As a child I never saw it and was never taught about it. 

Even if you think all the 8 year olds in your school completely comprehended it because they were able to follow rules of what sounds like a great teacher, this is not the entire picture of every school and every white kid, not by a long shot.

But a couple of things you said would still be deemed as problematic to some people. For example: you still dressed up as black people and whether or not you used actual black face I've seen many people say that's still not okay. That's not for me to decide, because I'm not black, but that is the opinion of some black people so it's something to think about. 

It seems like you're angry at me for sharing my experience because it does not reflect your own. And I'm not sorry for sharing it. I think its valuable to talk about and I think my experience is an example of why things should change. 

""If you're an american you know black face is wrong and you know why"" is the most ignorant statement I've seen. Not every American even knows what it is. Because of this whole topic with Shane I've been talking to a lot of people about black face, and I've had to explain to many people what it is, a lot of them are much older than me and had never heard of it."
598,2020-07-25 09:23:50,hwbkcl,by forming my own opinion after years of watching him?
599,2020-07-24 05:29:37,hwbkcl,They were saying racist jokes aren’t racist and there’s nothing wrong with racist jokes. Or something like that.
600,2020-07-23 13:06:58,hwbkcl,[deleted]
601,2020-07-24 03:07:49,hwbkcl,"Her ""identifying herself"" as black means nothing, she also ""identifies"" as Shanaynay...when her real name was actually Linda Johnson. She is supposed to be a delusional white girl. So don't take what her character said as evidence, take what other characters said to her as evidence. Shane played other characters that would call Shanaynay white or say her real name and Shanaynay would get extremely mad about it because the other character weren't playing into her delusions."
602,2020-07-24 00:47:49,hwbkcl,"Yeah, rated R works! Shane is not a cultural phenomenon like any of the movies/shows (all from different eras, and it's been driving me nuts, trying to find a connective thread!) 

Sure, he's big in YouTube world, but not sure how it equates to Hollywood success. I know Shane made millions off of that palette and videos overall, but its pennies compared to American Pie's $235.5m and Superbad's $170.8m. We don't know how much Shane grosses over his videos, but they are not American Pie or Superbad dollars. And the Jackass movie made $79.5m. 

The one mainstream project he did, there's evidence that shows he relies on uncouth, hateful humor even though intermediaries try to coax him not to and he refuses to edit any of it out. And of course the movie flopped. And reached nowhere of Degrassi/Jackass/Jersey Shore/Superbad/American Pie status. 

I work in media now and I'm well aware that YouTube stars can be just as, if not more, famous than mainstream celebrities. I can't judge that Shane is famous or not, I really don't care, but his ""edgy"" humor was actually really hateful and terrible in nature."
603,2020-07-25 15:17:45,hwbkcl,Then it's a stupid opinion.
604,2020-07-23 13:11:09,hwbkcl,"It was a written joke. I said adjacent cause it was just a passing phrase anyone could have said but the joke was they were caught off guard. It wasn't directly a slur. Dammit i cant remember the exact phrase. But she was definitely coded black not just ""ghetto"" or ""lower class"" just a lot of black stereotypes."

607,2020-07-26 15:10:47,hwbkcl,I like how merely defending a long-debunked accusation that PewDiePie is a Nazi is now sucking his dick.
608,2020-07-25 17:43:03,hwbkcl,Imagine actually believing he's a Nazi because of a dumb joke lol
609,2020-07-26 20:06:09,hwbkcl,It is when you’re calling people’s opinion of him stupid when the only one acting like a fool here is you.
610,2020-07-25 20:15:00,hwbkcl,hey this guy's a PewDiePie fan and has HUGE balls! see? no one cares.
611,2020-07-27 01:47:09,hwbkcl,Keep thinking that if it makes you feel better. I know I've got my facts straight.
612,2020-07-25 21:21:02,hwbkcl,"Nice attempt at a version of that meme, but it doesn't work. I never even said I was much of a PewDiePie fan, nor did I even mention my fairly average-sized balls."

619,2020-07-15 14:01:47,hrn41f,"Most relationships don't work out, statistically. So this is not necessarily about first relationships but just relationships in general. Out of all the relationships a person has in their life only one can last, the rest don't (excluding polyamory)

That said I'm still with my first boyfriend and it's still working out after 5 years."
620,2020-07-15 14:46:28,hrn41f,Not me personally but they can do for others.
621,2020-07-15 15:19:26,hrn41f,"According to my folks, yes. Met as teens, now and their 60s, been together whole time. TBH, I dunno what the hell they see in each other..."
622,2020-07-15 15:21:56,hrn41f,I was with my first Bf for 10 years (all my 20s). When I turn 30 (he was 29) we realised we were two different people and we had different goals in life (his involved studying abroad and me entering my dream job) so we decided to separate. It definitely hurt but at the end it turned out fine. I met my current Bf about 10 month after breaking up and been together ever since (4.5 years now)
623,2020-07-15 13:24:42,hrn41f,It's possible but unlikely. Just because a first relationship didn't work doesn't mean that it didn't matter.

I grew a lot as a person thanks to being with him. Changed my life. The way I look at the world and the way I look at myself.

Most first relationships don't last, but that doesn't mean at all that they didn't matter."

643,2020-07-08 15:31:38,hnh3cm,"Shane and Joey were friends during the era when youtubers collabed with each other constantly. They were also both in the closet and when they both came out that was when they started to drift. Joeys content changed and Shanes changed too and they grew apart. My theory on why Shane stopped posting on his old channel was to separate himself from his old videos, he knew that his past would continue to get brought up if he put his “documentaries” on a channel that once featured black face. So he created a new identity on the Shane channel and he honestly pulled it off well until all this stuff resurfaced again."
644,2020-07-08 14:36:41,hnh3cm,"Shane channel grew in popularity moreso than ShaneDawsonTV so he started just posting everything to the Shane channel because more would be able to see it, so ShaneDawsonTV died. Also he wasn’t doing blackface or saying racist stuff but was still full-on doing the pedo shit in 2013 and 2014 and even 2015. And all the years after that, albeit more and more subtlely each year."
645,2020-07-09 05:36:14,hnh3cm,"Joey's boyfriend recently tweeted a cryptic ""Beware of wolves in sheep's clothing"" during all of this drama which James Charles liked.

647,2020-07-02 18:42:10,hk1g4s,I remember watching this when it came out. I’m pretty sure Shane bought all the makeup for Joey to put on him and it was just the wrong shade. So that would be a problem on Shanes part. Not joeys
648,2020-07-02 18:04:39,hk1g4s,I remember him feeling bad. Of course Shane bought the wrong shade. It was clearly on purpose like it was a very clear multiple shades darker.
649,2020-07-02 17:52:56,hk1g4s,Jesus all you said was “remember when...” and people are jumping to “oh so we’re cancelling them now?!”
650,2020-07-02 18:18:28,hk1g4s,That’s the first time I’ve heard of Joey being anything other than nice. I thought he is rather unproblematic? Why do we need to cancel everyone? Everybody makes mistakes.
651,2020-07-02 17:51:19,hk1g4s,"So we’re cancelling everyone now? Jenna Marbles getting ‘cancelled’ went too far, now this? Let’s remember that we’re human and make mistakes. You’re contributing to this toxic culture, please reconsider."

657,2020-07-02 18:38:19,hk1g4s,Jenna Marbles cancelled herself. She did what she thought was right. Also I’m so sick of this whole “omg we’re gonna cancel everyone now?” reaction to someone pointing out problematic behavior. Pointing out something to be addressed doesnt mean theyre calling for someone to be cancelled.
658,2020-07-02 21:47:52,hk1g4s,"Lol I guess I phrased That weird. He obviously got the wrong one on purpose my point was just that Shane picked out the makeup for Joey to put on him, not Joey. I wasn’t trying to make it seem like “hehe oops this isn’t my color my bad”"

664,2020-09-03 04:03:46,ilao5n,"OK, so here is my opinion on this game setup (I'm not talking about the players though, because if this was to be a thing, it would have been different.) The whole idea is actually really doable and works well, but there are some portions that I think it could improve on:

1. Remove Dodgebolt on Day 1. If it awards too few coins, the coins may become useless if the Day 2 half performs poorly. On the other hand, if it awards a lot of coins, it will give the winning teams of Day 1 an unfair advantage.
2. If the Day 2 half-teams knows the coins that the other half-teams made, there will be teams that will do poorly (either due to having too many or too few coins). I'd suggest that the leaderboard is hidden until pre-Dodgebolt. That will create an incentive for every team to play at their best."

683,2020-09-02 00:03:49,ikfnvk,"I know that, but I actually like this generational grouping. Makes all generations 18-19 years is very balanced, compared to making it very short as 15-16 or less years or making it very long like 21-22+ years. It makes things easier for everyone else instead of all this confusion. But at the same time, this is all arbitrary. I know that we are not really millennials at the end of the day, especially based on how society views millennials and such, but maybe being a millennial is different to another person. Just my two cents."

686,2020-09-01 07:43:39,ikfnvk,"I dont think ""first who cant possibly remember"" or ""last who can possibly remember"" something are good markers to mark a generation. I mean it is very likely a three or four year old would not remember the political importance of these events. They may not even know who this Kennedy is until like years after he died. 1961 might have memories prior to Kennedy's death.  I am sure many 1959 and 1960 borns would not remember Kennedy's death. Many 1995-1998 dont even remember 9/11. 2015-2017 though can end up remembering a world before coronavirus 15 years from now, even though they may not know what coronavirus is.

689,2020-09-01 08:09:10,ikfnvk,"I prefer the ranges next to: instead of this rather than its this. Makes no sense for 1960 to be gatekept from the other two early 60s years. You even said 1980 should be start of millennials since it is the first 80s year. First half of the 60s is gen jones anyways. 

I have seen 1945-1959 as a baby boomer definition. 

Then 1960-1979. 

1980-1999 is one of the most agreeable millennial definitions I have come across. It is my favorite actually.

I have seen 1998-2016. Never 1999-2017 though. People would prefer stating X in 1960 if 1964 or 1965 is too late, since the first three years of the 60s are the full early 60s years, just like how you said 1980 should be y as it is the first 80s year.

694,2020-10-04 10:19:54,j4u35z,To improve this even a step further I'd suggest potentially just using the ratings from the past 3 or past 5 MCCs. Just because players can change skillwise overtime and by averaging players' scores that include their weaker or stronger MCC1/2 performances could result in an inaccurate representation of their current performance level. (e.g. Quig and Hbomb have done very strong in recent MCCs compared to their older MCCs)
695,2020-10-04 07:14:52,j4u35z,"only third place technoblade? 

L"
696,2020-10-04 11:48:43,j4u35z,Imo I don't think so that using score average on false  is a good way to represent her skills. This is because her performance has increased significantly between mcc 8 and mcc 9.
697,2020-10-04 20:55:23,j4u35z,"I think this system might rely too heavily on looking at a full performance if that makes sense? It doesn't really consider any improvements among players, FalseSymmetry being a good example. She's in the C tier but is the only person to win back-to-back games and also one of the rare few to ace a round in dodgebolt.

I think this system also values PvP skills a little too much, because while PvP skills are essential to winning the MCC, it's also not *all* you need. I think the PvP games inherently give more points to those who can rack up the kills, but then there's games that don't award as many points but some of the lower ranking players are great at them. The hermits as a whole can actually be used as an example for this in Buildmart. That game doesn't award a lot of points, but due to their experience in SMP they are some of the best in the roster at that game."

734,2020-09-23 02:05:32,ixzont,"Genuine question: This foundation color looks a lot like the colors that bodybuilders excessively fake tan their way into. Would you consider that blackface?

Not trying to catch you in ""well if that isnt blackface than why is shanes video?"" Because they are not the same. They happen at different times and are meant for different audiences. But I do want people to think more deeply about why actions are labeled the way they are. And if intention matters. 

I worry that as youtubes potential audience grows younger, that generation that wasnt around then consumes this older content and assigns intention to it that wasnt there at the time. Not because it should have ever been okay. But I do think there is a line that exists now that didnt exist then at the same depth. Its about understanding how that could make others feel. 

Thats where the comparison to excessive fake tan matters to me. We dont currently target that behavior as unacceptable because its outside of the everyday persons view. But I think if bodybuilding culture suddenly became widely consumed... there would definitely be people out there who would make it a big deal that they are changing their skin that dramatically.

So as much as that video should be taken down or not allowed to be profitable... I do think we should all still be seeking mutual understanding rather than villifying. Because if you cant do that, you are no better than someone on the other side who refuses to change their views."

Fake tan for competitive body builders is so the judges can see their muscle definition on stage under the harsh stage lights.

If the light skinned body builders kept their original pale skintone, judges couldn't see anything and they'd never win.

Therefore no, it's not blackface.

Also I find it hilarious when everything but the face is this ridiculous tan."
739,2020-09-23 06:46:21,ixzont,You might be interested in looking into r/blackfishing
740,2020-09-23 02:17:49,ixzont,"To answer your question about body building, a lot of people consider that example to be blackfishing which is basically an updated form of blackface. As per the rest of what you've said, lots and lots of people were critical of Shane doing blackface while he was doing it, which, in the grand scheme of things, was only a few years ago. Especially when you factor in that it's been considered racist to do blackface since long before the internet was invented."

743,2020-09-25 15:52:40,ixzont,"Blackfishing overlaps with blackface in many ways, but I think it has a separate name because it's more about people capitalizing off the look and appeal of darker skin tones (example: to seem more ""exotic"" to other white people) rather than directly degrading black and brown people as lesser humans as a form of racist ""comedy."""
744,2020-09-23 02:32:43,ixzont,"But to me blackfishing is a downgraded term, mostly because its acknowledging intent. And the nuance is very important, like the difference between manslaughter and murder. When we categorize inappropriate behaviors under large umbrella concepts, I think we belittle the actual instances of maliciousness and hyperfocus on the instances that are easier for us to target without any actual effort. Low hanging fruit."
745,2020-09-24 01:43:25,ixzont,Every controversy Shane has been through in the past Joey has stuck up for him. But now it involves Joey and he is on the hate bandwagon pls. Listen I don’t like Shane either but don’t fake like your his friend for years then bail on him.

761,2020-09-18 07:08:15,iut2dh,"Yeah. But that just means techno gets more points. U see it techno’s team isn’t good, then they can’t kill steal. So basically techno had the upper hand in terms of individuals. But then again it’s a team game so having good teammates support you is also helpful. My point is, Tommy got the first place fair and square with no upper hand.

I just realized how dumb this is. Please stop no I didn’t understand team coins back then please no no no no."
762,2020-09-24 21:13:47,iut2dh,"I mean, smajor did really well and it was wilburs best mcc in terms of placement, it was just burry kind of dragging them down"
763,2021-01-18 08:51:42,iut2dh,"4 months later but like, techno+wilbur+smajor is not a bad team, ESPECIALLY in mcc2 - in fact, it should have been a strong team. Techno would've gotten top 5 regardless, Wilbur was predicted anywhere from 15-25, and Scott was predicted top 10. Sparklez was only a top 20 player at this point, Tommy unknown, Phil top 20 guaranteed, and Puffy top 30. I would not even come close to calling that cracked at the time, everyone just performed extremely well as a group. Tommy getting 2nd, Phil in 6th, Puffy in 14th - these were all incredibly unexpected results. The latter 2 placed much lower in the MCC prior."
764,2020-09-17 22:09:59,iut2dh,"They had the exact same score and tied for 9-10 somehow according to Wiki Data, Ryguy’s VOD, and a Reddit placement for all MCC1 players. If I’m wrong, then please show me any sort of proof or a post."
765,2020-09-18 08:31:54,iut2dh,its a joke

790,2020-12-01 01:55:44,k47d2x,I'm curious as to how you arrived at these conclusions. How do Donald Grover or Bruno Mars feel like X in any way? And why does Victoria Justice feel like an early wave Millennial?
791,2020-11-30 22:55:31,k47d2x,"Pretty accurate tbh. Tho celebs aren’t really representative of a generation, unless it was a defining figure like, say, Kurt Cobain. They usually influence the next generation."
792,2020-11-30 23:18:12,k47d2x,Yeah this seems pretty accurate to me.
793,2020-12-01 02:28:51,k47d2x,"Well, Donald Glover doesn't exactly strike me as very strongly early wave Millennial realizing it (I originally put him in the extremely early wave Millennial cohort but changed it) so he seems a bit X or in-between (as you guys say: Xennial). Bruno Mars has been considered by a few on here before to have some X vibes, so I just put him there again. You are right I guess about Victoria Justice. I guess I just put here there as she felt a bit older being a regular member on Zoey 101, despite her being the youngest in the crew and only a year younger than Dustin (the main character's younger brother). That show was mixed with first and more notably second wave Millennials. Other than that, I can definitely see her being strongly second wave as she started her acting career at 12 on Suite Life of Zack & Cody and she made a guest appearance on iCarly, as well as being the main character of Victorious, both of which has basically a full second wave Millennial cast, with some exceptions (Mr. Sikowitz and Spencer Shay being second wave Xers)."
794,2020-12-01 02:11:49,k47d2x,Bruno has deep history and a good memory there's cute videos of him when he was little back in 90-92 and used to be an Elvis impersonator and I think he always loved MJ because he has retro sounds all over a lot of his music
795,2020-12-01 02:18:46,k47d2x,"Yeah Kurt seems like he could've been 18 in 91 rather than 24, some people his age weren't vibing with the 90s especially if they were settling down already I guess. He was a genius and a visionary even if he never wanted to be famous and a voice of his gen to begin with. I love that just the regular way they dressed in the Pacific Northwest became iconic and defined this whole era, I mean it helped that he was a gorgeous man and great voice though lol"
796,2020-11-30 22:59:50,k47d2x,"I would say that Kurt Cobain is extremely early wave X, but may have some late wave X tendencies (despite being so far away from late wave X), especially since he had two Boomer parents (who are still alive)."
797,2020-11-30 23:20:32,k47d2x,"I made one revision with moving Donald Glover from extremely first wave Millennial to sort of X or ""cuspy"" as he doesn't seem very Millennial to me as the rest on that list."
798,2020-12-01 02:33:41,k47d2x,That's just being a 90s kid.
799,2020-12-01 04:15:40,k47d2x,Yeah he always came across as retro and older to me. That’s part of why I like him a lot I guess lol.
800,2020-12-01 02:54:16,k47d2x,"Interesting. Also, what could make him seem even more so late wave X is that he had both parents as Baby Boomers instead of Silents."
801,2020-12-01 02:21:38,k47d2x,"Yeah no doubt Kurt will always be an icon, not just of grunge, but of popular culture. I love that era too. I think people his age (and my mom’s) were more part of the Breakfast Club/Fast Times 80s teen cohort anyway. The ‘90s grunge and alternative feel was more for later Xers like my uncle born in ‘74."
802,2020-11-30 23:06:17,k47d2x,True. Born the same year as my mom who considers herself early X. Late wave Xers were influenced by him.
803,2020-11-30 23:21:27,k47d2x,Makes sense.
804,2020-12-01 02:40:51,k47d2x,"Early 90s where it still felt like the 80s though, he was around for the old days in a way that even 1991 wasn't"
805,2020-12-01 02:31:49,k47d2x,"Totally yeah it's funny how people his own age weren't always fans, like I always wonder if friends of his were ever all ""Turn that shit down bro"" lol. Yeah I'd say the first wave grungers were like 1974/75.

I'm thinking the 1967ers who were breakfast club teens that fell out of modern music by 91 were types that got married or into careers young, but the younger minded ones were bound to be fans"
806,2020-11-30 23:07:09,k47d2x,Yep
807,2020-12-01 02:39:00,k47d2x,"I mean yeah my 1967 born mom was still listening to music then, even Pearl Jam and Nirvana, but she gravitated the most towards new Jack swing and R&B, which was a continuation of the trends of the ‘80s (Janet Jackson’s Control and Rhythm Nation, etc). The early ‘90s was honestly the last time she watched MTV extensively. The premiere of The Real World was when she tuned out. She graduated college in May of ‘91, four months before Nevermind came out. She hadn’t married young yet tho (wouldn’t be married until a decade later at 34 actually lol). Meanwhile my ‘74 born uncle thought it was just “white boys complaining about shit” (he listened to a mix of old school R&B, the stuff his parents listened to, and ‘90s rap. My mom was more eclectic/is pretty much listening to anything)."
808,2020-12-01 02:50:30,k47d2x,"Ya I wonder if the early reality shows and Beavis and Butthead is what started to alienate some of the 80s teens from MTV though there were those cool old rocker dudes who loved B&B too. My friends dad took her and I to the movie in 1996 when we were 9 and that's exactly what he was like, I was like I can't believe this 40 year old dad is such an easygoing dude who's letting us see this when there were uptight teachers and parents younger than him. I think he was a hippie teenager back in the day I wish I understood more about history then and could talk to him again now lol.

Oh speaking of R&B it's so interesting that new jack swing is like too 90s to be 80s but too 80s to be 90s, even Janet Jackson and the control album from 1986 sounds like it could be 92-93. Then some of the 80s r&b was really smooth like Lionel Richie and Kool and the Gang which is pure 1984 sounding"
809,2020-12-01 02:57:47,k47d2x,"Yeah that sounds like a cool experience. My mom’s younger friends loved Beavis and Butthead. She didn’t really watch it but she understood why it was popular. She was well into her 20’s at that point and didn’t have time to watch all that tho lol. I think it’s a classic show. 

Also yeah new jack swing as a genre is both very ‘80s and very ‘90s, imo the one genre that successfully “swings” (get it?) between two wildly different decades in culture. Janet’s albums are definitely ahead of their time. It gave R&B the edge it used to have in the ‘70s. The R&B in the ‘80s was soft and smooth by comparison (Lionel Richie as you mentioned, etc.)."
810,2020-12-01 03:36:10,k47d2x,"Yeah no wonder I feel older than my age being able to watch edgy tv before some kids were. I'm sure that guy was more of an exception since most fans are probably born 1970 to 1985 or something since it was teenage boys doing dumb stuff out of boredom. The first season was more edgy before they got the animation down too though I didn't know that until I got older.

Oh it's so interesting how new jack swing paved the way for the 90s while the softer r&b was extremely rooted in the 80s. Like the edgiest that Lionel Richie ever got (like Running with the night) was still very much 1983"
811,2020-12-01 03:45:50,k47d2x,"Yeah to be fair I feel older than my age tbh too since I got to watch “edgy comedy” before some kids. I even watched Family Guy as a kid lol. Yeah my ‘74 born uncle is more of an exception than the rule. He liked the older music like Aretha, Miles Davis, gospel, and early Motown that his parents listened to and played in the house. But he also liked ‘90s rap a fair amount too (could relate to the harder lyrics since he struggled a bit more in education compared to his ‘60s born older siblings). He just didn’t like the stuff the media was pushing out that was geared more towards white audiences like grunge, Beavis and Butthead and the film Reality Bites. (To be fair, my mom didn’t like that film either. She preferred Breakfast Club anyway. She liked grunge tho). 

Also yeah new jack swing paved the way for a harder edged sound, funkier beats. I love it. The soft R&B was a ‘80s trend. Lionel Richie’s Hello exemplifies this."
812,2020-12-01 03:54:01,k47d2x,"Oh I was thinking too there's some 90s slow jams that probably take something from the light 80s r&b too, like ""Nobody knows"" by Tony Rich Project or ""I can love you like that"" which I loved when I was 8 or 9 too.

Nice...Family Guy is the sh*t I would've definitely loved that if it was out when I was a kid since I liked Simpsons early on too. My childhood would've probably made a religious right-wingers head explode no wonder I love Kyle and Secular Talk now lol. That's so interesting your uncle likes older music (for his age) but also liked 90s rap and related to the working class struggles. I really should watch Reality Bites again I forget a lot of the plot, I feel I got more into the easy to watch 90s movies (whether it was disney movies or the edgier Wayne's World and Jim Carrey movies lol) but didn't get into the deeper, serious stuff until i was older."
813,2020-12-01 04:10:50,k47d2x,"Yeah no doubt there’s 90s slow jams too, kinda takes the quiet storm craze of the 80s. 

Family Guy is awesome, even if I haven’t watched it as much currently. Check out American Dad if you haven’t already, it’s just as great. South Park, though you’ve probably already seen and watched it plenty lol (don’t want to assume too much lol). Yeah, as much as I was a quiet nerd kid, I could also be a real edgy kid too. Guess that’s part of why I love Kyle so much too lol. Seems like both a serious political science nerd (obviously), but also a real edgy, off the wall jokey type of guy (shove my dick in a waffle iron as one of many examples).

Also yeah my uncle can straddle both musical tastes. He had struggled a little in education compared to his older siblings who were part of the National Honor Society in high school. He related to the kids that were struggling a bit. A lot of those kids that he related to were more working class than the more upper middle class lifestyle that my mom and older uncle aspired to successfully. My ‘74 born uncle did grow up to do pretty successful and raise a family in his own right tho, don’t get me wrong. But I think having a little bit more of struggle compared to his siblings hardened him (not in a bad way). On top on that, my uncle ADORES/really admires Malcolm X. They even have the same birthday (May 19). I think he related more to Malcolm than MLK because while MLK was a gifted orator, Malcolm got his point across in a more straightforward manner that my uncle could relate to. My uncle admires his dad (my grandpa) for that same reason. Very straightforward, no bullshit. They communicate very well, and whenever I saw together like at weddings or something, I would notice that lol.

Also imo Reality Bites is a good movie. The characters seem unlikable but that goes for any 20-something esque Movie lol. I love those movies you mentioned too."
814,2020-12-01 04:41:02,k47d2x,"Yeah oh gosh that's all awesome. I really admire Malcolm X and MLK even if the media suppresses his socialist speeches but since Malcolm was even more direct they can't make him seem like a neoliberal. Your uncle seems badass like he'd appreciate Kyle and the real left I think you said your mom supports Bernie as well?

Yeah I was surprised Kyle was kinda introverted off the air but I relate to being both extroverted in the right environment when you're comfortable but then quiet and keeping to yourself sometimes too (that's part of being emo too lol). 

For sure 90s movie characters aren't goofy and immediately easy to like since they're more complex compared to 80s lol, but some like the guys from Clerks really grew on me especially Randall"
815,2020-12-01 04:58:15,k47d2x,"Yeah I admire both. MLK was always a democratic socialist, and more forward thinking than in just civil rights. He was anti-war, pro-workers’ rights. Malcolm was just more aggressive about it in his approach than MLK, which is why you don’t hear Malcolm tributes like you do MLK tributes from neoliberals and Republicans. 

Yeah my uncle, while I don’t know his political beliefs outright, it would not surprise me if he liked Bernie. And my mom does support Bernie yes. She wasn’t always a full on leftist (she supported Obama twice) and even back in the ‘90s when she wasn’t as fully tuned into politics would say she’s a centrist, but when she heard Bernie, she liked what she heard. I didn’t even need to convince her of the merit of his policies, she just immediately liked what she heard like that. She also loves Malcolm X and MLK too. Her other preferred/more loved candidates were more on the populist left like Marianne Williamson and Andrew Yang. (She admired Marianne’s stance on reparations and Andrew’s UBI proposals). My mom also admires our congresswoman Illhan Omar for her own straightforwardness and forthrightness, and the progressive policies she believes in. We were actually at a rally at the University of Minnesota with Bernie and Omar - November 3rd, 2019. It was amazing. She initially didn’t want to go because it was late and she didn’t know the place all that well, didn’t know the directions. But when we got there, the Revolution (Prince’s old band) played, and we had so many great speakers. Keith Ellison (our attorney general), Nina Turner (my mom loved her the most), of course Bernie and Omar. It was beautiful. 

Also yeah, considering Kyle’s profession, I thought he would be a little more extroverted than he actually is lol. But yeah I can relate to being an ambivert (mix between extrovert and introvert).

And yeah, I love those ‘90s films just as much as the ‘80s ones for how down to earth, raw and honest, yet sarcastic and funny they are. Love Clerks. Kevin Smith is awesome."

817,2020-11-28 05:52:32,k2hzh4,An observation on my part: Towards the more recent MCCs the game order has been a pretty significant deal in comparison to the first few MCCs. And Scott has been improving greatly on the matter of Team Balancing.
