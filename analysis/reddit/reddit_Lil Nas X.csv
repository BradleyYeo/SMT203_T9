0,2020-02-05 17:53:44,ez9xk1,No mention of the influence RDR2 had on the song blowing up. The original video for the song was just red dead footage and the song starting getting hot when everyone was memeing about being a cowboy because of the game.
1,2020-02-05 15:16:55,ez9xk1,Why does OP keep referring him to Nas? Like just call him Lil Nas

5,2020-02-05 17:23:17,ez9xk1,"This is all retrospective mythologising. Everyone knows virality helps a song spread, major labels are pushing social media challenges on tik tok and the like for a reason. Old Town Road smashed it but there’s no lessons in replicability here (being stricken off the country chart etc all have massive momentum to the song). Also very dependent on your music itself, there are a load of artists whose music just doesn’t fit with a meme presentation. If yours does then by all means give it a go but this kind of rhetoric just fuels insecurity in artists when they don’t blow up with a meteoric rise in five months out of nowhere."

16,2020-02-05 19:34:50,ez9xk1,OP from the original thread also created this [The Kanye Story](https://thekanyestory.com/) website which is even better than this write-up.

Isn't the thing with a lot of failed startups that they advertise ad nauseum and try to build up marketshare only to fall to pieces because they don't have a relevant good or service to sell?"
21,2020-02-05 18:14:59,ez9xk1,the marketing genius of lil nas x aka stealing sauce from Lil Tracy. its always been fuck lil nas x.

23,2020-02-05 20:06:29,ez9xk1,"Anyone find this really... depressing? I know the image of the artist who only cares about quality and not branding is idealized, but art made specifically for viral success is just so artificial. I respect the grind, but there's no love in this music."
24,2020-02-05 19:21:23,ez9xk1,"Lil Nas X is an industry plant that got lucky. He made a somewhat viral song after a little internet popularity and some label decided to push the record and him. 

That's what happened. A record label capitalized off the hype and him being kicked off the country  billboards, and then got Billy Ray Cyrus on the song, furthering the hype. Then after the hype, Lil nas x came out as gay, solidifying him as a gay icon and all but guaranteeing the gay community would support him, especially considering his flamboyant nature. and after all the hype died down, it didn't matter because kids were hooked and streamed it repeatedly.

Labels have stakes in apps, video services etc. Labels have asked viral stars with help to make their songs go viral. No Lil Nas did not that alone. He is a plant. That song was the perfect storm of notoriety, catchiness, and label machine to make it what is was. 

It's ok. Lil Nas is an industry plant. So is Logic, Lizzo and anyone else who ""checks all the boxes"" and comes out of nowhere with major label support"
25,2020-02-05 20:41:14,ez9xk1,yeah.
26,2020-02-05 22:23:28,ez9xk1,For every Lil Nas X there’s a million people who have tried to succeed in the same way. So much of it is luck based.

32,2020-02-05 18:06:43,ez9xk1,"He kinda just trolled until he stumbled on something that gained steam, capitalized, then went back to trolling. At this point homophobes and stupid people trying to make a tinfoil observations are keeping him relevant."

37,2020-02-05 20:31:09,ez9xk1,"""Billboard has a loophole whereby remix plays count towards the original song's chart placement.""

If this were the case, why was remix with Billy Ray Cyrus at #1 all those weeks instead of the original? Wouldn't the version with just Lil Nas X by definition have more streams than the Billy Ray Cyrus remix?"
38,2020-02-05 17:26:11,ez9xk1,"With how it was obviously a ""plant"" or whatever

I'm curious how much he actually owns of Old Town Road. With his age, and lack of experience wouldn't suprise me if it isn't much at all."
39,2020-02-05 20:48:26,ez9xk1,TLDR he was a tweetdecker who decided to bite lil Tracy’s swag but make it more mainstream accessible
40,2020-02-05 20:42:13,ez9xk1,The song started popping right around when Red Dead came out and I thought he made it BECAUSE of the game like as a joke because literally everybody was raving about Red Dead Redemption 2. Little did I know lmao

47,2020-02-05 19:53:07,ez9xk1,"Because calling him ""Lil Nas"" over and over again is a lot clunkier, and most people reading this would use context clues and understand that the author was referring to Lil Nas X."

56,2020-02-05 21:21:50,ez9xk1,"That's one way to look at it. Another is that the more you promote the more likely you are to get recognition. With that comes the money, access, and audience to keep making music.   

Just look at Stormzy. He built enough hype around himself to go from YouTube freestyles to headlining Glastonbury in the space of a few years.    

He'd only released one album..."

""Getting on"" could mean a life changing amount of money for a struggling artist, even if just off one song. That money would afford them the ability to focus more on their music than ever before. 

What OP said was 100% right. Quality definitely matters, but people who believe that quality is the reason something blows up are *absolutely* wrong."

71,2020-02-06 00:32:01,ez9xk1,"While I understand people don’t want to equate making hip hop/ any music to a business making money, hip hop artists (many not all) are famously known for rapping about the pursuit of money and a constant theme in lyrics is being all about the money and if they weren’t getting it from rap they would go get it from other sources like selling drugs. So it’s not a stretch to think some people like Lil Nas approached it with that money first mentality."

Music has been about this for decades. Music is a product, you advertise and promote your product.

Old Town Road is just one of the most blatant and extreme examples of this. But it's not new. Soulja Boy is another example."
74,2020-02-05 18:05:08,ez9xk1,You saying that like it wasn’t a number 1 song before the billy ray version
75,2020-02-05 19:10:49,ez9xk1,"music has always been like this though... it's just the music and hip hop scene adapting to the changes around us in the internet culture. I think it's still promoting yourself well, putting out good stuff and you'll build a following."

77,2020-02-06 00:26:08,ez9xk1,it's very much pop music now and is treated the same way pop music has been. you have some great stuff but there's always gonna be people can exist primarily based off marketing and not the strength of the music

Either way, Lil Nas X is either incredibly smart, or lucky. Only time will tell though, because he can only milk the release a mid song/have someone popping jump on it = $$$ but for so long. Then again, he has the LGTBQ community behind him so who knows."

I don't think many celebrities are fine with whatever money they had in the beginning of their career and definitely want to reach the biggest celebritiy status ( not just known mostly as that ""used to be a musician"")"
135,2020-02-05 18:18:04,ez9xk1,Did I say I wish that? I just dont think his music is any good. And music is ever evolving. I'm happy for his success. He seems like a nice kid.

140,2020-02-05 20:27:14,ez9xk1,Logic Fucking stinks. If you need any evidence of bad lyricism go to the song Twisted with Juicy J. I've never been a logic fan. His bars are forced and he rips entire songs. He's bad.
141,2020-02-05 21:49:53,ez9xk1,i watched an interview with take a daytrip this morning. they said he had an A&R in his first studio session with them. In his first session he made Old Town Road and was presented the beat for Panini. A&R told him put the beat to the side. Unknown artists without a single song ever made don't have A&R. He's a plant

170,2020-02-05 22:20:24,ez9xk1,"I suppose I'm just being a bit harsh, but I feel like a lot of mainstream pop music is pretty disposable. Basically I feel that way about most music that is made with the intent of ""blowing up"", and/or making money. I think that sort of mentality leads to artists watering/""dumbing"" their art down, in an attempt to appeal to the masses. That's how you make money.

If that's their goal, or part of their art, fair enough. I just find that musicians creating music for the sake of creating music, without regard to any sort of market, tend to make more interesting music. That's just my personal opinion though, and as we all know, art is very subjective. I just feel that after a certain point it ceases to be art, and simply becomes a commodity."
171,2020-02-05 19:10:24,ez9xk1,gucci found him
172,2020-02-06 14:38:37,ez9xk1,"That's one opinion. But for a lot of starving artist, they just want to get a check. And I don't see anything wrong with that. Obviously they have to understand there is a certain level of ""quality"" needed for people to listen. But generally you can have less ""quality"" and more promotion and get a successful song. And if it leads to them not being poor anymore, then all power to them."

176,2020-02-05 18:54:20,ez9xk1,the funny thing is all those “irony” or “funny/weird” twitter accounts will go on record and deny that they weren’t tweetdecking but literally every tweet they posted was mass rt’d because they thought it was “funny”
177,2020-02-05 18:53:04,ez9xk1,what exactly does tweet decking do? reading about it didn’t give me much insight into how it can help you blow up

179,2020-02-05 19:21:00,ez9xk1,They all retweet each other and many steal tweets from less popular accounts
180,2020-02-05 19:25:38,ez9xk1,"Basically, it was an old app (that twitter took down) that let you log in with up to 4 (i think 4 was the max not sure) twitter accounts at the same time. So what people would do is post the same tweet to 4 different accounts giving it a better chance at picking up traction. This resulted in a lot of accounts, owned by the same people, posting the same jokes over and over."
181,2020-02-05 20:24:43,ez9xk1,Pretty much. Also almost all stolen tweets as well
182,2020-02-05 17:28:01,ez9xk1,I’m sure many musicians are using artificial means to boost their stuff lol. Look at the world star promotion plan stuff.
183,2020-02-05 20:53:47,ez9xk1,Yes. I am rational and don't lie or perform mental gymnastics. It's amazing that people appreciate honesty.
184,2020-02-05 23:17:38,ez9xk1,How do you determine his genius tho? Does he need other records that sell? He has those. Does he need avenues to make more money? He has those too. Does he need to match the success of OTR? That’s an impossible standard.
185,2020-02-06 01:16:17,ez9xk1,It very much does IMO
186,2020-02-05 20:07:19,ez9xk1,That’s fine. That is the best version of the song. But the song hit number one on billboard a week before the Billy ray version was released.
187,2020-02-05 20:40:12,ez9xk1,"Why do you think there's a crossover between people who are fans of Lil Nas and people who have a big interest in hip hop? I see no correlation mate, OTR didn't blow up and stay at number 1 because hip hop fans latched onto it, he hasn't taken the shine off any underground artist. Lil Nas is a pop artist

""meme music"" is just a lazy criticism, what does it even mean? Sure it benefited from memes but so do a lot of songs in the charts nowadays. Don Toliver for example had his biggest hit 6 months after he released it because TikTok got a hold of it."

And yeah, I guess you're right that there's nothing wrong with a musician doing it for the money not the art but that does leave a bit of a sour taste in my mouth. I think it devalues music as an artistic medium, although I suppose that there have been a small subset musicians who have always done that and, as active listeners who prefer art, it's our job to ignore it."

215,2020-02-05 19:59:23,ez9xk1,"It's a clique, essentially. You make a group, everyone posts on social media, and you all retweet/share each others' posts. You build a following on the backs of them, and if you pick up new followers from outside this circle, they get passed around to the people that helped you out.

It works best if you have bigger members in the mix, because the bigger accounts help people make medium-sized accounts that cater to slightly different audiences, those big/medium accounts help make *even more* medium accounts, and then the slight differences in userbases mean that a pool of twenty users can be reaching millions of unique visitors, which they wouldn't have otherwise.

Unfortunately, there are a lot of parallels to rackets, and as someone else pointed out, a lot of this ""funny content"" was actually just stolen from smaller accounts and passed off as their own. Lil Nas X's account (@nasmaraj) actually got banned for tweetdecking."

Explain to me how a song from 2017 blows up in 2019 without industry push? Stop. Answer that question because that doesn't add nor does it add up and when I look at the state of the culture it makes sense *She* would get pushed because she checks all the boxes. 

So Lizzo was signed to a no name label in 2013, drops her next project in 2016.. which takes off 3 years later producing one of the biggest songs if not the biggest song of 2019? 

No. Plants have connections and some plants are talented. I think one of Lizzo's connections said ""Hey there's this talented big girl that no one pays attention too. She's fat, loud, unapologetic, black and talented. This one song has a line about men not being shit. Lets push it. 

That's what happened. There's a reason you failed to respond to one point. Make some sense, dickhead."
225,2020-02-05 20:53:13,ez9xk1,I have. It's not good. I've heard him on boom bap beats he's not good. Eminem collaborating with someone does not make them good. Logic is not good and fails when you compare him to any lyrical rapper.

her song blew up bc a random scene from a Netflix movie went viral. why it's so hard to believe that people can like certain things?

also songs blowing up much later after they were released isn't that uncommon. Roses by SAINt JHN has been blowing up in Europe since last year while the song itself was released in 2017 and he released a whole new album *without* this song. is he an industry plant too?

> So Lizzo was signed to a no name label in 2013, drops her next project in 2016.. which takes off 3 years later producing one of the biggest songs if not the biggest song of 2019? 

oh, so indie artists don't exist anymore? she released 2 albums while being an indie artist and spent on a major label 3 years before blowing up.

> No. Plants have connections and some plants are talented. I think one of Lizzo's connections said ""Hey there's this talented big girl that no one pays attention too. She's fat, loud, unapologetic, black and talented. This one song has a line about men not being shit. Lets push it.

Gaining traction  and having a song from 2 years ago blow up overnight are totally different. There's also a reason you failed to respond to the difference in Lizzo and Snt Jhn. Snt Jhn didn't go from Indie to a song from 2 and half years ago being the number one song in the country.

No because unlike Lizzo, Frank Oceans timeline makes sense. He was in a famous group, dropped a classic mixtape that made him a household name, and then dropped a classic album. Lizzo had a song from 2016 go to number 1 in 2019 after appearing on Netflix. 

>white girls also don't get discriminated even by their own kind every day and are more priviledged in this soceity than black women tho? funny how you're boasting all that shit and yet you comparison is wack.

Because Frank dropped a classic mixtape that unlike Lizzo *blew up right after it drops*. We've seen the Frank story a trillion times. Frank went from unknown to known because Nostalgia Ultra is a classic mixtape. He blew up right after that tape dropped.

Between the lack of comprehension and shit analogies I don't think you're too smart. Lizzo was planted. Prince has worked with a lot of singers who never had commercial success. Working with Prince doesn't exclude you from being a plant. It actually bolsters my argument.

We're on an American site, on a subreddit focused on an American music genre, discussing an american music artist. I'm American. I'm not deflecting because you're from another country with a different system speaking on American racial issues you know nothing about besides you read on Reddit.

>didn't know that music has expiration date.

What other artist had a song go number 1 that was released two years prior? I'll wait. I asked this before and you failed to answer it so I'll ask again. What other artist had a song go number 1 that was not charting beforehand and was released 2-3 years prior? None. Because Lizzo is a plant that was hand-picked for this era. 

>also coming back to Frank Ocean. Chanel is blowing up on TikTok rn so he is an industry plant too?

Frank is an established artist who's first classic project dropped close to a decade ago. Frank's first classic project, did not go unnoticed for two years before skyrocketing to number 1. Franks music spread organically through sites like DatPiff because I have to remind idiots like you, this was pre-streaming. 

Lizzo and Frank are not remotely close. Lizzo was relatively unknown dropped projects that got no traction and then one day an old song of hers got put in a Netflix movie which made her and that song blow up. Frank on the otherhand dropped a mixtape that blew up right after it dropped, was a part of a known group, and then followed that mixtape up with a classic album. 

>Tyler himself said that See You Again was the first time when his music was in rotation on radio.

Now you're lying. I've provided sources. [Yonkers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yonkers_(song)) peaked at 27 on the charts,  and led to Tyler the Creator winning Best New Artist the year that song came out because of the hype it generated. 

The music video for the same song released in the same year (2011) has been viewed over 120 M times. Yonkers was Tyler's breakout song. He was a known act because of that song. 

>it's funny that you saying some shit like this and then go to defend white women.

Before I respond point by point, I'd like to highlight how you still haven't answered a question I've asked multiple times: What other artist has had a non-charting song go number 1, 2-3 years after it was released? 

This means that based on Lizzo's past work you would expect her to have a lower level of commercial success over the course of her career. Because of the success of Frank Ocean's early projects you would expect him to achieve at a much higher level than Lizzo, which is why you can never call him a plant. Lizzo is still a plant. She's an extremely talented plant, but she's a plant nevertheless. 

>oh, if being socialist and being liberal in the US was the same thing, then Dems wouldn't try to block Bernie from the nomination.

That being said, your point still claimed I'm deflecting. I'm not deflecting. I provided context to why I ""didn't"" forget part of the political spectrum. Your response only proves I wasn't deflecting. Thank you for proving for my point. 

>my point really flew over your head, huh.

Your point and analogy are both bad due to the differences in the two artists career. 

>nd Lizzo was quite known as an underground rapper and had co-signs from 1) one of the greatest artists ever lived; 2) one of the most acclaimed indie artists of the 10s. so?

""underground"". ""Indie"" None of these terms illustrate how she would go from unknown to number one during a summer without being a plant. You're acting like I'm saying Lizzo's not talented. She's a talented plant. Someone saw her, saw her past work and saw today's climate and decided to push her. 

>LMAO. i said radio and you linked me a chart with digital sales.

If you're 27 on the charts and selling music, you're on the radio. MTV pushed odd future because of the popularity of Yonkers. I know you're not american, so you didn't watch music videos before school in 2011, but Yonkers was on every fucking day. It was on Hot 97 every day. Yonkers has 120 M youtube views, won Tyler an award and peaked at 27 on Billboard. No Tyler is not an industry plant and no, you can't compare his rise to Lizzo's. Lizzo never had one of their first songs get 120 M views on youtube. No Tyler's not a plant and you cannot argue that he is one. This is a tangent. 

>the idiot here is the one who thinks that it's the same for white and black women.

but she didn't went #1 during a summer. she had been grinding for 10 years. and had been noticed by critics and genre heads before she blew up. Fantano was praising her long before she blew up, for example.

Critical Acclaim and Commercial Success are totally different things. Going number 1 on billboard is a commercial achievement.  Her grinding for 10 years doesn't explain a song from 3 years ago getting picked up, put into a netflix movie and going number one unless she was a plant and had that song pushed. That's the reality.

Yonkers was named [a song that defined the decade by Billboard](https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8544250/tyler-the-creator-yonkers-songs-that-defined-the-decade) 

It's not on Radio charts because [Billboards archive](https://www.billboard.com/archive/charts/2011/triple-a) doesn't go back that far with actually charts. You're spewing nonsense. That archive is blank and the same site named that one of the songs of the decade. You've proved my point. Tyler was not and never a plant. This is a tangent.

That's why this love and the other songs on the album have different release dates.

360,2020-02-05 15:56:02,ez7iff,"Think you meant to link to the post, not the comment:

361,2020-02-05 14:30:46,ez7iff,But damn... that song.... it gets stuck on a loop in your brain...
362,2020-02-05 14:37:22,ez7iff,"I read in the New Yorker of all places how he had kind of mastered tik tok's algorithm for promoting the song, using a combination of well timed posts and coordinated tweets.

That song is basically the dumbest song in history, but it is catchy af and you can't fault him for marketing the shit out of it."
363,2020-02-05 14:17:58,ez7iff,appreciate the share. thank youu
364,2020-02-05 17:28:48,ez7iff,"Can someone explain what the linked comment is claiming about the chorus not being repeated at the end and only being 30 seconds long somehow led to doubling the number of streams?

Unless I'm misunderstanding, they're suggesting that people are listening to the song and then listening to the chorus at the beginning of the song again, **and then stopping**?  There's a clear outro to the song, so that doesn't make any sense to me.  It's not like the song loops back into itself.  

And lots of pop songs start with the chorus.  ""Don't bore us, get to the chorus."" - Berry Gordy"
365,2020-02-05 16:16:26,ez7iff,The first one we received for radio play was without billy ray and didn’t do much the billy ray version was popular
366,2020-02-05 18:14:49,ez7iff,"Honestly the song is catchy and is meant to be. I don’t think anyone really expected genre-mixing like this to work so well. Not to mention the remixes that came out were interesting in what other artists contributed.

The man hustled and it paid off for sure."
367,2020-02-05 15:24:48,ez7iff,"It's definitely impressive and the song is great but part of me kind of resents this a bit as it's a shame so much energy goes in to marketing vs actually creating stuff. It's all a bit commercial/soulless. 

Interesting read though and fair play to him, song is catchy af!"
368,2020-02-05 17:27:04,ez7iff,"A lot of the replies are complaining that music has turned into a money/business thing.

It's been that way for 3 decades. It wasn't so long ago that albums were mixed to be as loud as possible. It ruined the sound quality, but made the album stand out when played in a store."
369,2020-02-05 19:59:16,ez7iff,So he basically promoted his music by memeing it to fortune and fame. genius.
370,2020-02-05 20:59:43,ez7iff,"Not that I don't respect Nas, as an entrepreneur. It's clearly smart and his hard work really paid off.  

But what has become of music if you need to think about how you present yourself rather than what you really want to make?  

I get it, I get it. People need to make money, people need to eat. But with this attitude, it also means that from now on, people who make stuff without caring how others perceive it, will never ever gain the spotlight again. You've got these people cracking their heads about views, memeability, subscriptions, going viral, ... how are you ever going to gain attention simply because you want to make something you just like? I'm sounding edgy, but capitalism as it is really is the worst. It motivates a certain kind of mentality and awards people who are power hungry."
371,2020-02-05 22:31:06,ez7iff,Honestly this makes me respect him a lot.
372,2020-02-06 00:57:25,ez7iff,"Dunno if I’m crazy or have unresolved childhood issues, but my brain distilled it down to “guy gains notoriety in Internet version of a high school cafeteria, and uses that to promote his weak-ass song so parents in Nashville and kindergarteners in Hollis are singing it.” Thereby getting rich.

Amazing and horrifying at the same time."
373,2020-02-05 17:41:43,ez7iff,I think it kinda helped that Red Dead Redemption 2 had come out a few months prior.
374,2020-02-05 18:34:09,ez7iff,"Probably helped that he released it on Christmas Eve too. You know, when everybody is at home with their whole families, kids, etc trying to figure out something to do with their time off. Play the song on your phone and all it takes is one person in the room to ask about it."
375,2020-02-05 20:48:33,ez7iff,That’s super interesting.  I wonder how the different exploits of technology will change music composition.  The idea of a “single” was very much influenced by old wax cartridges that came before records.  Basically composers in the early 20th century would write their music to fit on the 2ish minute medium.  This happens with all new modes of music distribution.
376,2020-02-05 23:33:24,ez7iff,"Pfft, grindcore and powerviolence bands have been doing this for 30+ years"
377,2020-02-07 09:04:52,ez7iff,He stole a song....period. No talent and he's paid millions of dollars. #Hack
378,2020-02-05 15:27:40,ez7iff,"I thought everyone already understood this. His entire schtick isn't genuine; it's all to make money. The song and the persona screamed to me: ""i need to think of something completely different that can't be ignored... something guaranteed to go viral"" and that is a gay, black cowboy singing in a fake country accent.

He understands one of the quickest paths to relevancy that can turn into influence is a viral video. And the formula worked.

I still can't handle the affectation he uses in Old Town Road. It's absolutely not his real accent. Listen to his song Panini. It feels more like he's trolling country music than anything else, and I'm surprised more people in the industry aren't bothered by that."
379,2020-02-05 18:57:36,ez7iff,The song is a fucking commercial they reference like 30 products in 2 mins
380,2020-02-05 16:37:20,ez7iff,Very over night to me. I woke up one day and literally every twitter post was about this new song.
381,2020-02-05 19:27:15,ez7iff,"This song is one of the most painfully processed songs I’ve ever heard. Toss in a handful of old dog billy ray cyrus trying to remain relevant, it’s extra awful."
382,2020-02-05 18:09:48,ez7iff,"He also did kind of play the “country music industry isn’t letting a black man thrive” card, and got a movement behind it to promote sales.

The kid is a marketer at heart for sure."
383,2020-02-05 15:35:09,ez7iff,I have no idea what song this is
384,2020-02-05 17:09:33,ez7iff,I mean having a huge name like Billy Ray Cyrus on it was pretty important too.
385,2020-02-05 21:28:39,ez7iff,Interesting. I have no idea what this is or why I'd care.
386,2020-02-05 22:42:02,ez7iff,I hate that I have heard that stupid song. But good on him for finding an inventive way of marketing himself/his music.

388,2020-02-05 15:59:40,ez7iff,I think the cover by Walk of the Earth is better than the original. [https://youtu.be/hRXv_VU35Lw](https://youtu.be/hRXv_VU35Lw)
389,2020-02-05 23:25:28,ez7iff,"I grew up with Biggie, Nas and Tupac now kids grow up with Lil Nas X and I just kind of feel bad for them."
390,2020-02-05 16:28:30,ez7iff,"Shit, I've heard that song once.

Didn't really care for it."
391,2020-02-05 16:43:51,ez7iff,This makes me like the song even less.
392,2020-02-05 18:19:06,ez7iff,"So basically the song really is trash and he tricked people. I figured this was the case, the song itself sounds amateurish and isn't country at all but because he had everyone wrapped around his finger he could make more fake controversy about not getting a country music award."
393,2020-02-05 14:52:36,ez7iff,"Not really a lot of savvy promotion, one very savvy act of editing on the song."
394,2020-02-05 18:12:43,ez7iff,The song is so bad there is no other way it could have gotten big
395,2020-02-05 17:53:28,ez7iff,"Sacrificed musicality for money.  Got it.  

It's a catchy song, and I like that he's successful but let's not treat ""gaming the system"" as anything to celebrate."
396,2020-02-05 16:57:20,ez7iff,"This just further  proves popular music is all marketing tactics and has literally nothing to do with musical ability or producing quality

401,2020-02-05 20:48:41,ez7iff,"Just in case no one else posted, the song was heavily influenced by NIN's Ghost track 34. The album itself was released under a common creative licence. Trent Reznor was very complimentary about it

404,2020-02-05 19:09:56,ez7iff,"Not a problem for me since my entire brain shuts down at the term ""Gucci cowboy hat"" - that single phrase encapsulates all of the worst aspects of both rap and country at once."
405,2020-02-05 14:45:12,ez7iff,Every generation has stupid catchy songs. The Macarena was horrible and everywhere.
406,2020-02-05 15:05:02,ez7iff,"It's kind of insane that he was sleeping on a couch and working at six flags this time last year, now he's worth $3mil"
407,2020-02-05 15:25:40,ez7iff,I don’t know if it’s fair to call it the dumbest song in the world. Crank dat is dumb. Laffy taffy is dumb. Watch me whip is dumb. Old Town Road is an out of left field genre-bending track that relishes in its own absurdity.
408,2020-02-05 15:29:19,ez7iff,"The song deserves more credit than you're giving it. It's simultaneously a successful parody song and a successful mixing of genres. It's a way more interesting song than the Macarena or Gangnam Style. It actually generated a lot of great conversation about music! What he did with the multiple remixes for the song was not just commercially savvy, but artistically savvy too considering how long ago hip hop had moved away from making multiple remixes of singles like that. While the song certainly has some silly parts to it, its far from ""dumb""."
409,2020-02-05 15:14:53,ez7iff,"There's a million songs far far stupider and less original.

It's at least somewhat creative in combining hip hop and country, basically a much more consumable and friendly Young Thug song."
410,2020-02-05 18:20:51,ez7iff,"*Ah Louie Louie*

*Oh, baby! We gotta go! Ay ay ay ay ay ay*

In a world where this song exists and was popular, Old Town Road will never be considered the ""dumbest song in history."""
411,2020-02-05 17:29:33,ez7iff,"I just prefer to mishear the lyrics.     
“I’m gonna take my hoes to the hotel room.    
I’m gonna ride till I can’t no more”"
412,2020-02-05 19:42:17,ez7iff,"> That song is basically the dumbest song in history, but it is catchy af

As someone who hates that song - you need to be called out. If a song is indeed catchy, it has merit and value (by definition). It's also not even close to the dumbest song of all time (I look forward to counter arguments)."
413,2020-02-05 17:57:00,ez7iff,"The early 2010’s had sexy and I know it.
The late 2000’s had peanut butter jelly time 
The early 2000’s had Blink 182 

I think that all time periods have their “catchy stupid song”. Just watch when it gets played for us when we get shipped off to a retirement home"
414,2020-02-05 18:39:56,ez7iff,old town road is actually more creative and thought-provoking than 99% of the trash that gets produced

417,2020-02-06 00:00:26,ez7iff,"This is also only evident in the original version. The Billy Ray version has a chorus at the end and much more popular. I personally feel like the remix version has a better outro and more complete than the original, so I always listen to the remix version."
418,2020-02-05 16:49:50,ez7iff,"Which is another interesting twist in the story of the song. I’m not active on Twitter or TikTok so I first encountered the song via the Cyrus remix; if I’m being honest it was his inclusion (not really the verse, but just hearing BRC and an entire layer of nostalgia for the days of “Achy Breaky Heart”) that got it into my playlists."
419,2020-02-05 18:42:15,ez7iff,"The first one hit number 19 on the Hot Country chart. That was all Lil Nas X. Then thanks to that success and the press from Billboard booting it off the chart, the collab with Billy Ray came about."
420,2020-02-05 22:06:07,ez7iff,"> I don’t think anyone really expected genre-mixing like this to work so well.

I think the [Nelly/Time McGraw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3htOCjafTc) song did it a little better."
421,2020-02-05 15:34:02,ez7iff,That's the world though; there are billions of people and even if only 1% are great at creating that's hundreds of millions of people. Without promotion/marketing no one will ever hear/see what those incredibly talented create.
422,2020-02-05 18:21:47,ez7iff,"He did use the money to make an EP that’s really good and tackles plenty of serious issues, like his coming out."
423,2020-02-05 18:32:02,ez7iff,I think it's just another reminder that it's not good enough to be talented at something: you also have to have the skill to sell it. And that's not something that should be discounted.
424,2020-02-05 17:21:16,ez7iff,If you're not good at marketing and promotion you have no chance of being financially succesfull in the arts.
425,2020-02-05 23:32:59,ez7iff,"All the creative talent that went into old town road is what Reznor and Ross put into 34 Ghosts IV, Lil Nas is pretty much just pure marketing."
426,2020-02-05 18:18:57,ez7iff,"3 decades ago was 1990. Music has been big business for most of human history, let alone the 20th century."

430,2020-02-05 15:55:07,ez7iff,He’s a funny guy that made a catchy song and also happens to be black and gay. I can’t understand how you interpret that as ingenuine lol
431,2020-02-05 16:59:57,ez7iff,"I think a part of it comes down to understanding the irreverent sense of humor from his generation. It’s not typically meant in a mocking way and is usually meant to poke more fun at themselves. 

In this case he is contrasting his identity with something that most wouldn’t expect him to be associated with. He is simultaneously poking fun at both contrasting aspects in a way that forces you to really think about them and why they are contrasting. That can only happen if you don’t take yourself (or your genre or whatever) too seriously."
432,2020-02-05 15:47:35,ez7iff,"A theme in hip hop is that money/material wealth = status, so even the choice of drafting on that genre is intentional since you cannot really ""sell out"" and take a hit in the public's eye from that."
433,2020-02-05 16:03:24,ez7iff,"With your replies to other comments in mind, tons of gay artists have pretended to be straight. Now we’re upset about a straight guy pretending to be gay because it’s not authentic?

Get off your high horse"
434,2020-02-05 22:37:08,ez7iff,so you think wrangler paid an unknown kid to reference them or he thought mentioning wranglers would get more streams? brands exist irl and are allowed to be referenced without something being a commercial.

436,2020-02-05 17:45:56,ez7iff,"But Billy Ray wasn't on it at first. Billy Ray was on the remix, which was created after, you guessed it, it got on the Billboard chart and was removed.  It was already a big success, and Nas used that big success to get more success."
437,2020-02-05 15:46:32,ez7iff,"It was number 1 on the country charts before the controversy. So while the controversy helped it explode to what it became, it wasn't the sole reason."

442,2020-02-05 23:48:44,ez7iff,"Except it was totally him. The email registered is the same as LilNasX's account. And if you try to link to a nasmarai (the account that was created after nasmaraj was banned for spam), it straight redirects to the current account name, which just so happens to be LilNasX.

So the options are that it's him, he bought the account, or he timed a banned account clone perfectly, without the original owner ever complaining.

Given his complete lack of money at the time, it's so much more likely to actually be him."
443,2020-02-05 19:57:14,ez7iff,So he admits to buying that account?
444,2020-02-05 19:51:18,ez7iff,Not doubting but a screen shot or link would be a lot more believable

After the song blew up a manager retroactively got clearance for it and Trent was awesome enough to let that happen. Yes, he now has a credit listed for Old Town Road and would be getting royalties for it but so he should! He could have taken 100% - which has happened with other artists using samples without getting clearance first. I weirdly found out about all this last week - after (unbelievably I know) finally hearing Old Town and catching up on the saga."
451,2020-02-05 18:56:58,ez7iff,Why do you think we've listened to it 150 times? Cos it's a banger regardless what you can say bout marketing
452,2020-02-05 19:11:57,ez7iff,I've heard it maybe 5 times and can immediately pull the tune to mind.  I could do that after hearing once.  It's a catchy tune.

I have watched several people talk about the history of modern music in america and the idea of hillbilly and race music, the differences in hip hop styles due to geography (specifically Atlanta based artists), and also how country music has been trying to incorporate elements of hip hop to make their music more popular to modern audiences.

People are often so hellbent on finding some unseen merit in the shit they like, but it's okay to like a song that's dumb on the outside and dumb on the inside as well. I promise you, no expert would call this artistically savvy, and being more complex than two of the best examples of dumb-shit-bomb-hits in history isn't exactly some gold standard to celebrate."
468,2020-02-05 18:58:48,ez7iff,"I've never heard it before this thread. Just gave it a listen (the original, 1:55 version) No it's dumb I'd much rather listen to Gangnam Style. Possibly even Friday.

Maybe we can agree it's better than Macarena, but then again I only remember the Macarena Monkey. The rest of the song might have something going on. (Edit: No it's as bad as I remember)

But I agree the omitting the last chorus is a smart, money-grubbing idea."
469,2020-02-05 17:11:19,ez7iff,">successful mixing of genres

That's *very* debatable. I'd call it a massive failure in that regard. IMO, the end result has to be a good song to be considered successful."
470,2020-02-05 15:30:42,ez7iff,I wouldn’t call Old Town Road original when it uses a track from NIN Ghosts album.
471,2020-02-05 19:00:15,ez7iff,"Blink had a lot of angsty deep lyrics though, the songs they wrote weren't as simple as Old Town Road that's for sure."
472,2020-02-05 23:44:51,ez7iff,">I think that all time periods have their “catchy stupid song”

You could probably go to the Billboard Top 100 for *any given week* in history since the lists have been released and find stupid ass songs on there.

The ""music these days sucks"" people are some of the most annoying, incorrect people to encounter on the internet. There's always been popular music that sucks and there always will be."
473,2020-02-05 23:48:17,ez7iff,"People are gonna hate on you for that take but I agree. 

It started a conversation about ""country music"" and challenged people's preconceptions about how music can be categorized between genres. It's not like a lyrical masterpiece but it provoked more thought and conversation than a VAST majority of the other songs that charted last year."
474,2020-02-05 15:15:28,ez7iff,"Yup, just remember to be as unoriginal as you can, and still end up somewhat famous."
475,2020-02-05 18:07:23,ez7iff,"> Since the song doesn't give it to you, you go back to the beginning to listen to it again. 

Do *you* do that?  I certainly don't."
476,2020-02-05 17:19:22,ez7iff,I wasn't sold on the song until the Kidz Bop version.
477,2020-02-05 16:09:44,ez7iff,"I know, that's true, just personally it's not something I can get excited about. I find self promotion and marketing draining and a pain to have to do. I'd love to be an artist who had someone else who did all that though, some people (like Lil Nas X) are great at it.

I realise it's a necessity if someone wants to be commercially successful, but I tend to favour music that's more hidden or undiscovered as it seems more interesting and 'pure' in a way rather than stuff that's gone through the music machine.  Not that million selling pop singles can't be brilliant too of course."

480,2020-02-05 19:00:20,ez7iff,"Some people have someone who does the selling for them. 

Loads of my favourite music artists didn't bother with promotion or even playing live but luckily someone often helped them out. E.g. East River Pipe and other indie cassette/bedroom artists"
481,2020-02-05 18:58:36,ez7iff,"Well obviously. You're preaching to the choir. 

Although I guess the exception is people who get snapped up and have a record label do all that for them! E.g. X factor or something!"
482,2020-02-08 13:53:11,ez7iff,Yeah although the vocals are really catchy too
483,2020-02-05 18:41:22,ez7iff,"Sure, but the 90s was when I started paying attention to the music industry. I can't comment on anything before then."
484,2020-02-05 16:26:14,ez7iff,"He's ripping on them in a fun and loving way - country stars aren't dumb, and they rip on themselves, too. There is a LOT of very self aware and satirical country music out there. This is just someone else poking fun but earnestly and only hitting the parts that are silly.

Of course it isn't his real accent - and *that's part of the fun he is making*. No one thinks it's real. His name is ""Lil Nas X"", for Pete's sake. No one thinks he is a country bumpkin making it big in Nashville.

Keith Urban isn't necessarily the best example here, as Australia does have quite a bit of country. But his accent isn't real, just like tons of alt bands put on a British accent to sound like Arctic Monkeys."
485,2020-02-05 16:12:41,ez7iff,Oh good point. Never thought of that.
486,2020-02-05 18:34:25,ez7iff,"Yeah, Taylor Swift dominated the country charts with a twang that mysteriously disappeared with her shift over to pop, yet you'll find very few people wondering how a gal from Reading, PA had that accent in the first place."
487,2020-02-05 15:49:19,ez7iff,"Literally my first thought after having read this comment

With everything else being so seemingly calculated it would seal the perfect demographic crossing formula for an artist if they were gay. I’m not accusing him of faking that part of his identity but it seems he faked everything else soo..."
488,2020-02-05 15:51:11,ez7iff,"As a gay man, myself, I am not sure. Probably not pretending, but his whole persona has all been so effective that it's hard for me to wrap my head around what's real. But that's so much of the entertainment industry to me now.

He was pretending to be ""country"" with that extreme affectation, and that's what is uncomfortable to me. It's very off-putting.

Edit: How was this so trigger-y for so many people? Me saying ""I'm not sure"" lead to this many downvotes? You need to relax, kiddos."
489,2020-02-05 17:00:45,ez7iff,"Uh

There's a difference between

""I'm a gay man who has to act straight so people don't hate me"" 

And 

""I'm a straight guy acting gay for attention""

This is why we have Pride in the first place - as a community we had to **earn** our right to stop pretending.

that being said, I don't think he's pretending. And if he is, he's at the very least doing it in a way that isn't negative."
490,2020-02-05 16:08:53,ez7iff,"I think this is probably one of the dumbest things I've ever read. Being forced to stay in the closet because you can't come out is completely different, you half-wit. Careers are on the line. Do you think Ellen was always this popular?

Also, I'm just speculating here. Not saying he actually is pretending. Just saying it all feels incredibly calculated.

Clearly there are too many children in this thread to have an actual discussion."
491,2020-02-05 23:07:24,ez7iff,"Maybe
The point is it was great advertising for lots of people and probably lucrative if done correctly
Aka savvy promotion"
492,2020-02-05 16:18:49,ez7iff,"I looked it up and you were correct, just gonna go back to listening to some Shadow of Intent and Joe Hisaishi."

498,2020-02-05 23:52:17,ez7iff,"Leave it to reddit to get all the details while I’m at work, thanks for the info! Looks like I was just talking out of my ass"
499,2020-02-05 19:58:54,ez7iff,"No that he had nothing to do with it at all, people just linked them together for the name, the fact that the user was also gay and that he likes Nicki but he said it wasn’t his"
500,2020-02-05 17:25:54,ez7iff,So apparently I was today years old when I found this out
501,2020-02-05 18:26:59,ez7iff,"Weird cuz Stan seems like a portmanteau of Stalker and fan... 

is this a coincidence or is Eminem a genius on a level I had never before appreciated?"
502,2020-02-05 17:10:05,ez7iff,"Yeah but if you didn't listen to hip hop in early 2000s (either young, old, or diff music taste) then it makes no fucking sense"
503,2020-02-05 21:22:13,ez7iff,I love that song and did not put together that it was a reference to it.  I'm 28 and had no idea what a stan account was.
504,2020-02-05 20:40:51,ez7iff,"I love how the responses are either ""Oh cool I learned something new"" or people angry that they didn't know and are convinced it isn't a thing."
505,2020-02-05 17:53:24,ez7iff,"Even if, it stopped being niche this year."
506,2020-02-05 20:02:13,ez7iff,Lol. I'm sure the song had a role in the creation of the term. Pretty clever to whoever came up with it.
507,2020-02-05 21:43:53,ez7iff,"In replying elsewhere, I just noticed your username and wanted to ask: is that a reference to the Emerald City?

As a reference, I find it a really appropriate username to talk about retro-definitions (or whatever the term is), such as claiming Eminem coined ""stan"" to mean obsessive fan."
508,2020-02-05 17:15:19,ez7iff,"Maybe?

I just did a quick googs and urban dictionary said it was short for stalker fan on Twitter.  I don't do the tweets so I assumed it was a young person thing"
509,2020-02-05 17:56:01,ez7iff,It just makes them sound dumb
510,2020-02-05 17:22:56,ez7iff,"actually i heard it comes from the eminem song ""stan."" but in that song, stan was a crazy stalker, so..."
511,2020-02-06 00:03:57,ez7iff,"Yes we do.

We make that abundantly clear in our [submissions guidelines.](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/wiki/beforeyousubmit) which are not only linked in our [submit page](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/submit) but also in our [sidebar](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/about/sidebar). (EDIT: They were also linked in a removal message you recieved for a previous submission.) In fact it shows up in at least two of our rules. Our first rule states that 

>This subreddit accepts links to singular comments, singular comment chains, and **text posts** from the reddit.com domain only.

And our second states

>Comments or **self posts** from certain subreddits may be automatically removed.

Which should clearly imply that there are self posts that *are* allowed.

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/wiki/beforeyousubmit#wiki_self_posts_and_comments_only.) is a link to the bulletpoint in our submission guidelines stating that self posts are allowed. It even gives examples of what a self post looks like, which the [OP of that post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/eytom3/the_marketing_genius_of_lil_nas_x/) definitely falls into.

If you could tell me what wording, (and where you saw it), that gave you the idea that we don't allow self/text posts, or can suggest wording that would more clearly convey that we do, that would be appreciated. Apparently multiple rules stating or implying we do as well as a explicit mention on our submissions guidelines page (with examples of what is and is not allowed) isn't enough, as evidenced by your comment, so I'm really at a loss for what else we can do to alleviate confusion."
512,2020-02-05 20:09:10,ez7iff,"Not saying it's a bad song by any means, though I did hear it a good 30 times in a month, and I only listen to the radio for about 25 minutes a day on my commute. Just about once a day, every day, I would hear it. Almost ridiculous how much it was played."
513,2020-02-05 20:15:57,ez7iff,"I work at a place with an open juke box. I fucking *loathe* that song. It is not interesting, it is not sensical, it's just annoying."

Gangnam style

I love a lady who is warm and compassionate by day,
A classy girl who knows how to enjoy the freedom of a cup of coffee
A girl whose heart gets hotter when the night comes
A girl with that kind of surprise

I'm a guy
A guy who is as warm as you during the day
A guy who one-shots his coffee before it even cools down
A guy whose heart bursts when night comes
That kind of guy
Beautiful, lovely
Yes you, hey, yes you, hey
Beautiful, lovely

I am Gangnam style
I am Gangnam style"
529,2020-02-05 18:48:04,ez7iff,"Lol I never said it was a masterpiece, you're turning what I said into a straw man. What I was arguing was that it isn't just a dumb song. But even then did you not pay any attention to the discourse around it? Because I promise you experts (or just critics, writers, etc.) absolutely called it savvy and gave it praise. No ones saying its a masterpiece but its absolutely an interesting and thought provoking piece of music.

Look up what Anthony Fantano has said about it, he's the biggest music critic on the internet and he ranked it #21 on his list of best singles this year.

Here's NPR talking about it: [https://www.npr.org/2019/07/01/737499385/country-music-gets-a-hip-hop-infusion-with-old-town-road-and-the-git-up](https://www.npr.org/2019/07/01/737499385/country-music-gets-a-hip-hop-infusion-with-old-town-road-and-the-git-up)

530,2020-02-05 19:10:54,ez7iff,"I'm gonna assume that if you're so detached from the modern music scene that you'd never heard the song until today than you probably have none of the context to appreciate why its good or interesting. On the other hand, different strokes for different folks. So I'll just say agree to disagree."
531,2020-02-05 17:19:12,ez7iff,"Well of course, it's subjective. Either you like the song or you don't. But I think the remix with Billy Ray Cyrus (which really the full version of the song to me) is pretty incredibly produced, and where the genre blending really shines."

A radio station, online or terrestrial, has people making decisions on what music to group together.

A live venue is choosing acts that will have viability with their clientele.

Streaming services have robots trying to link music people like with music that they might like.

559,2020-02-05 19:27:44,ez7iff,"Stan is one of the greatest Hip Hop songs of all time, idk how this went over anyone's head."
560,2020-02-05 18:58:59,ez7iff,"Genius on a level you had never before appreciated for sure. No matter what you think about hip hop music, Eminem's way with words is magical."
561,2020-02-05 19:51:48,ez7iff,"Two possibilities:

1. He needed a name that rhymed with ""fan"" to make the lyrics work and Stan was the first thing he thought of
2. Eminem is a genius.

Frankly, I believe it's both, but not at the same time. Eminem's lyrics are pretty genius all around, and the word didn't exist in this context before, but to say that he realized it was a possible portmanteau for Stalker + fan is a bit of a stretch.

First of all, Stan was an obsessive fan, but not quite a stalker. Stalker has slowly drifted to include these people, but I don't really think of him as a typical stalker. He only tried to meet once and pretty much assumed the identity and mimic the life of Slim Shady and not try to really harass or persecute Eminem for that. He idolized Slim Shady, not try to hunt him down obsessively on the level many stans of today do.

Second, tell me what name you would have tried to rhyme with ""fan""? The list is short. It's Stan or Dan. If you want to get into name character types (in modern day examples, Karen, Susan, or Chad), then Dans tend to be arrogant asshats while Stans tend to be timid to the point of obvious low-self esteem that constantly get picked on (Stan Marsh, Stanley Ipkiss). Stanley Ipkiss should really come to mind here because he's the guy with The Mask, so conflating another's identity with his own is also a strong theme here."
562,2020-02-05 20:45:17,ez7iff,It is very obviously a portmanteau
563,2020-02-05 19:43:03,ez7iff,"More likely it's just a name that rhymes with ""fan"""

One doesn't get that with a simple translation with no footnotes. It's a casting of the spotlight to examine the open secret of the bourgeois hedonism of the upper classes, separated by their luxury of being able to preoccupy themselves with simple fascination of satisfying hormonal urges. Who but the upper classes may be thinking about coffee, that $10 cup of Arabica beans? Certainly not the struggling working class, to whom coffee is just a drug to get through the working day. Gets hotter by night? Only the rich, with house help and plenty of clothes and makeup to get ready to party away, while the workers just yearn for the comfort of their bed so they can repeat the next day. You can't associate with Gangnam's style, where everything is more expensive in the area; if you can't afford the $30 meals and designer clothes and the plastic surgery. But in the end, it's a celebration as well that as a nation only not many decades from previous famine and war, and currency crisis, that Gangnam exists, as dreamy and aspirational as the vaunted American Dream. To be frivolous for the present moment, to break out in proud Horse Dance, to not to have to think about nuclear weapons in the north."
598,2020-02-05 20:06:01,ez7iff,"I didn't say you called it a masterpiece either, so I'm just gonna ""no u"" that strawman accusation.

Fantano is a bit of a prick imo, and he's just a single music critic, catering to a very specific (though big) audience on YouTube. As far as I know, he doesn't hold a degree in musicology or composition, or any musical degree for that matter. The same goes for most critics and music press people. They can still be good at finding music, and they can have great tastes, but asking a professional critic why the biggest single of the year is so big, is like asking a four year old why their house is nicer than their friends. They'll likely give a lot of explanations (4yos and critics are both *very* reluctant to admit ignorance), but none of them will be the cold truth that capitalism fosters inequality. This doesn't mean that you can't stay in the nice house, but there's no reason to believe one house is nicer than the other because the mom is much better at drinking adult juice.

In case that monstrosity of a metaphor got out of hand, what I'm saying is that until an *actual* expert (musicologist / trained composer or producer / veteran musician) comes along and tells me that that bog standard Soundcloud rap song is actually way more than what it seems on first dozen listens, I'm gonna stick with my reasonably well informed opinion that the song isn't very deep.

All that aside, it still kinda slaps, Lil Nas is charming and funny as hell, and I agree that the song has brought into the mainstream a long awaited discussion about genres. It's just that I and all my musician friends have known that genre is dead for years, and OTR isn't anywhere near subversive enough to be the actual catalyst for that change. When the (kinda basic) music press latches on to something as the most important thing to happen in a decade, it's usually just the most visible symptom of a much bigger whole. Again, nothing against Lil Nas, I actually really like him, but he is *way* overrated."
599,2020-02-05 19:23:13,ez7iff,"I do not, what's the context? As far as I can tell it's because it mixed country and feel-rap?"

601,2020-02-05 15:56:46,ez7iff,"Yeah and lil nas x's personality and flair had absolutely nothing to do with its success. It's most distinctive feature is the incongruence of a young black man singing in a deep resonant way a country song.

606,2020-02-05 18:43:53,ez7iff,"Fair enough.  I've gone back and listened to the song and I now have a better sense of what the OP was getting at, but several things about the argument are still wrong.  Also, I'm almost certain they're just regurgitating [an argument from this medium post](https://medium.com/the-public-ear/old-town-road-has-changed-how-we-will-listen-to-music-forever-de5b1652951f) but misremembering some of the details:

>“Old Town Road Remix’s” structure is also extremely different to that of its genre. It starts off with an intro, chorus (which is kind of still the intro), verse 1, refrain, verse 2, refrain, chorus, verse 3, chorus. Compared this to other songs in the Trap genre, which almost always finish with the chorus at the end being repeated to make the song feel complete, you almost get a shock when listening to “Old Town Road Remix” as the song just suddenly ends after one final chorus. This ‘shock’ is due to the superior temporal gyrus in your brain which stated by Catherine Chauvel; “stores ‘templates’ of music that you’ve listened to recently.” So when you listen to “Old Town Road Remix,” it sounds a bit different to songs of its genre as the ‘templates’ in your brain have the chorus repeated at the end and also don’t have the Country element associated with the Trap genre.

That all makes sense to me.  But the chorus of the song is not 30 seconds long.  It's 8 bars that last about 14 seconds.  The beginning of the song is 8 instrumental bars (14 seconds), then a single chorus (14 seconds), which gets you to the 28 second mark, then the first verse starts.  The medium post goes on to claim:

>As theorised by YouTuber “Alfo Media” in his video “How ‘Old Town Road’ Could Change Streaming Forever,” he addresses the fact that both of Lil Nas X’s songs have abused Spotify’s payout algorithms. In short, only listening to 31 seconds of a song is needed to be counted as one stream, and one stream pays the artist 0.0043 cents. “Old Town Road’s” first chorus just finishes at the 31-second mark, coincidence? I think not! This could be one reason as to why both songs are in the Top 5 Global songs (at the time of writing this).

>So for people listening to “Old Town Road Remix” and feel like they want a little bit more, they instinctively play the original to hear that catchy chorus one more time.

As I already pointed out, the intro + chorus actually ends around the 28 second mark, not 31 seconds, but fine, whatever--if you assume it takes the user a couple seconds to hit stop after listening the beginning of the song again, that gets you just over the 30 second mark.  But more importantly, does anyone actually do that?  **Listen to a song, then listen to the first 30 seconds of the song again and hit stop**?  Wouldn't you just listen to the entire song again?"
607,2020-02-05 21:48:49,ez7iff,Can you think of any other Post Malone songs that only play the chorus twice? 🤔
608,2020-02-05 18:48:43,ez7iff,"To be clear, I'm not doubting that people listen to catchy songs on repeat.  I do that all the time.  I'm talking about listening to a song, then listening to the first 30 seconds of that song and then pressing stop.  I find that implausible."
609,2020-02-05 22:14:00,ez7iff,"This post makes me wonder how Gangnam Style became so popular. The song and video itself is nothing really that special to me, it's just another catchy song, but it was the first to break the 1 billion barrier on YT"

617,2020-02-05 22:40:45,ez7iff,"That point is irrelevant.  It was at #19 on that same chart before the media—namely *Rolling Stone*—made it into a controversy.  A whole *nine days* passed between the song getting moved from the charts and *Rolling Stone* publishing their article.  If it weren’t for that article, the song would’ve suffered the same fate that “The Git Up” did: fading into oblivion after six months and never being talked about again.  Lil Nas X (smartly) milked the controversy all the way to having the longest-running Hot 100 hit, despite all the correct info about the song and its ascent into fame being right in front of us.

I honestly don’t even hate his music, I’m just shocked at how people actually bought into it without questioning anything in this matter."

He couldn't exactly just reach out and touch Eminem. Em never replied because he was busy. He might have been off on tour or whatever (they met when he was on tour) 

But he was talking about loving Eminem and wanting to ""be together"" with him. Typical stalker shit. 

The point is that:

* he's uber-passionate
* has a strange fixation 
* unrealistic expectation of his relationship with Em and
* mentally imbalanced enough to do something about it, except it manifested in self-harm and harm of those closest to him.

657,2020-02-05 16:05:03,ez7iff,"I would say a song that incorporates an interesting sample and uses it well is probably more creative than a song written using the same chord progressions, melodies and patterns that have been a standard in pop and rock for the past 70 years. Just because it's played on instruments or doesn't use samples doesn't mean it's more original."
658,2020-02-05 16:05:03,ez7iff,"Most pop songs are originally composed and just use the same few chords. Just because theyre being played live doesnt make them creatively original. ""Closer"" by the Chainsmokers is unoriginal because it uses the same melody as the Spongebob episode where he works at the Chum Bucket if you wanna go that route.

On the other hand, check out [""America's Most Blunted"" by Madvillain](https://youtu.be/jytxkJUM_7U), built entirely on samples. Madlib cuts and edits them to a point beyond recognition, and with MF Doom's raps turns it into something wholly unique.

Or an even less extreme example, [Pete Rock and CL Smooth's classic ""They Reminisce Over You""](https://youtu.be/BONgL61snlM) is one of the most iconic loops in the genre. Its a sample of a jazz cover of a Jefferson Airplane song. It takes just a couple notes of that cover, notes that could be completely missed listening to the song, and stretches it into its own song and gives it life in a way the original didnt. *That* is original and creative."

724,2020-02-05 19:47:40,ez7iff,"Tbh it's 90% hip hop 10% country. 

The opening banjo notes are actually a sample of nine inch nails, not very country or hip hop. It's not played in a country or bluegrass style its literally a couple chords on a banjo. 

The beat is a standard hip hop beat, the verse is entirely hip hop, the fusion aspect is totally overplayed (which I guess is another cunning piece of marketing). 

In fact the only real country things about it are the lyrical content, everyone singing with a southern accent and Billy Ray Cyrus having credits on it. Hence it never really had the same popularity amongst country fans.

Don't get me wrong I'm not faulting the song for it but it's hardly a hip hop country blend

About YoungKio, the producer of the original beat lil nas purchased: "" He sampled Nine Inch Nails' track ""34 Ghosts IV"" and kept the song intact instead of chopping it as a challenge to himself, saying he ""didn't really have any country thoughts about it."""

I appreciate what you're saying, and I agree that a good treatment of sampling is every bit as creative and artistic as an original melody.

I guess I'm just having an [Onament VI](https://nypost.com/2013/05/15/43-8-million-for-this/) vs Mona Lisa sort of crisis here.

> It takes a piece of something, reinterprets it, puts it under a magnifying glass front and center, and layers a lot on top of it.

I think you've elegantly nailed what makes a good sample. 

Does 'Old Town Road' really do that? The NIN - 34 original is a meandering instrumental piece, of which the first 1:15 is comprised pretty much exclusively of the hook used in 'Old Town Road'. 

There is no *puts it under a magnifying glass*-- the sample is literally the only element of a significant part of the song. There is reinterpreting, yes, though that begins and ends with the addition of a cookie-cutter trap beat. A 'reinterpretation' that works just as well with pretty much any music sample from any genre (excluding jazz perhaps?). There is nothing skillful at work here-- any novice with an afternoon's worth of experimentation with Fruityloops could have produced an identical product.

And after having said all this, apparently 'Lil Nas X' didn't even craft the beat, he bought it for 'less than $50' on a stock beat website.

The creator of the beat, 'youngkio' [*also wasn't aware that the original sample was from NIN(!!!)*](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ptKqFafZgCk). Meaning he must have procured the hook from someone else-- almost certainly another stock clip music site.

Whatever our views on music sampling, I hope we can agree competent producers ought to at least be aware they're using samples in the first place?

I'm really struggling to see how anyone involved had any artistic vision or musical skill whatsoever. This song truly is a triumph of marketing brilliance and luck over substance."

  Way at the bottom. Which is what people called out. It's not a Billy Ray Cyrus song.  

  

>2) They also admit its a regular occurrence for them to celebrate hits.  Given that the publicity company in question is likely the one that Cyrus uses but not Lil Nas X, it makes sense that they would celebrate one artist over the other.  I mean, come on, anyone should be able to put that together, even Billy Ray Cyrus.  There really wasn’t any need for him to do that either, seeing as he’s a meme now and any halfway intelligent person could put together that nobody would be talking about him if not for a song.

  There's no reason to be a stand up guy? What?  

 
  


>3) Just the premise of the article is spurious.  LNX wasn’t “erased” from country music at all.  He made an appearance at CMA Fest last summer during Keith Urban’s headlining set to sing the song, which was also played by every damn bar band in Nashville that weekend.  He also made an appearance at CMA Fest where he won an award there.  Also, not saying you believe this, but if someone thinks it’s because *Paper* called them out... do you really think anyone on Music Row reads that rag?

  
  That's irrelevant. All that is after the fact.

748,2020-02-05 19:45:49,ez7iff,Your argument is incorrect because you seem to think usage of google was flat over the past 20 years when that’s absolutely not the case. Everything on Google trends basically doesn’t go back past 2010 because the 2000’s were google’s rise to dominance and their analytics were being refined.
749,2020-02-05 19:34:21,ez7iff,"See [my other comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/ez7iff/uharrydry_explains_why_old_town_road_wasnt_an/fgmr0n3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf), if it was mainstream I would hear about it in the last ten years (ten years, ffs) as I actively sought out new concepts and ideas like the aforementioned headcanon. For your POV I’m a normie, completely uninterested in hip hop or the Eminem an I only heard about stans this year (2020)."
750,2020-02-05 19:38:35,ez7iff,"Ok so since the data doesn’t back up your argument, your point is now “if I haven’t heard of it, it cannot be mainstream”?"
751,2020-02-05 19:40:38,ez7iff,"What’s your mainstream definition? For me it is The Atlantic or NY Times, did they use “stans” in the meaning you want?"
752,2020-02-05 19:46:44,ez7iff,"I don’t have one. I’m not even arguing that the term “Stan” is mainstream (although I would consider it to be). My point is only that the two definitions you’ve argued (a zoomed in google trends graph and your own anecdote) are whack. I appreciate the theory you’re trying to apply, it’s interesting stuff and sounds like a cool job. But a single google trends graph doesn’t provide the type of data you need to draw those conclusions."
753,2020-02-05 20:07:05,ez7iff,"OK, so about the google trends,the critical thing is that it is not the popularity, it is the first derivative of popularity, the number of people who haven’t heard about the term googling what it means. If this is constant, the growth of the number of people learning that stan is a thing is constant, which means the growth of the number of people that know what a stan is is linear, a constant number per any division of time. That’s the basic fact we learn from the google trends.

For the other thing my experience is one data point and yours is another one equally valid. From my other experience, it is quite hard to comprehend how the culture is split between niches, everybody thinks that everybody subscibes to his niche and it is really hard to free yourself from this kind of thinking. In my own personal niche there was this famous Trevor the Cockroach case last year, Have you heard about it? Probably no. In that sense the Internet culture is comprised of niches unless something goes globall y (really earth wide) viral, or The NY Times mentions it. Stans never went viral or been mentioned in the NYtimes. And neither was Trevor. The rest is niches and it is OK."
754,2020-02-05 20:16:44,ez7iff,">	the number of people who haven’t heard about the term googling what it means

Almost. The critical distinction I would make is that it is not “the number of people”, it is the “popularity of a search term, relative to its own historical popularity.” There are no units on these graphs. If you see a flat line that then spikes, that could indicate an increase from 20 searches to 200, or it could be a jump from 20 million to 200 million. You could have constant linear growth in perpetuity, and that doesn’t tell you how popular a term is."
755,2020-02-05 20:21:19,ez7iff,"I have to precisely disagree, The units are the number of search term queries against the time, and the number, as far as I understand it, is absolute. So if it shows 10 in a day scale, there was ten people a day learning what a Stan is."
756,2020-02-05 20:25:09,ez7iff,"They’re not. Look again. They are on a scale from 0-100, where the highest value for the specified window is *always* 100. Try it — use any term you want, zoom into any window you want. You will never see a value higher than 100, and there will always be at least one peak at 100."

# Step 1: Use artificial tweet boosting to get yourself to 148,000 Twitter followers

---

The real marketing advice here is not ""engage with your users :) ✰"", but to [have an artificial network of popular accounts that coordinate retweeting and promoting each other and stealing viral content](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/04/lil-nas-x-was-a-popular-twitter-user-before-old-town-road.html) in order to gain hundreds of thousands of followers:

>@NasMaraj **(Lil Nas X)** was a popular Twitter account with a six-digit follower count that gained said following through artificial boosting engagement through aggressively producing viral threads and meme posts. It was suspended by Twitter at the same time as many other prominent accounts employing similar strategies, a network of tit-for-tat promotion known as “tweetdecking,” for the same reason.

>...

>Lil Nas X may seem like an overnight success, but his breakthrough is the product of a years-long, 21st-century marketing plan — one which has been banned from Twitter for its reliance on spammy tactics and copying others.

Don't get me wrong. I follow him, and he's very funny and down to earth, but his first step was absolutely without a shadow of a doubt to accumulate a large following through shady practices. 148,000 followers is *massive* in the world of comedy Twitter, and it's obvious that the song would become successful to some degree.

I can speak from experience with having a semi-popular music project a few years ago. Posting meme videos with your own backing track has been around for literally years before LilNasX.

Just like most viral things, the biggest thing at play here was **luck**. 

If you really want to dissect it, why did LilNasX's meme videos take off rather than any other person doing the same thing? There are thousands, and thousands of these type of vids posted daily.

It's honestly pure luck. Of course he doesn't want to admit this. Every successful person always want to claim hard work... but let's be real. Posting meme videos for *months* is not hard work. It's luck."

I don't really ""get"" OTR or meme-pop/meme-rap in general, but i give him mad props for having his finger on the pulse & tastes of GenZ teens.

895,2020-02-04 21:57:42,eytom3,"Yes, I think, and it might be good or bad, but thinking of a business like a propaganda machine like lil nas x did is the most effective way. The connection to people by coordinated marketing approach and purposeful viral marketing attempts. He did the same by looking to make a following, then testing out what works, and trying to create a viral meme by listening to what tidbits of already popular things will make it viral. Then it was getting his record deal. 

On the other hand, thinking of the business model and all the internal work that don't require influencing customer's minds, is the exact opposite, like refining a machine that is predictable."

899,2020-02-05 02:58:22,eytom3,This is interesting. I used to sub to r/blackpeopletwitter but had to unsubscribe right when this song was blowing up because the posts were inundated with Lil Nas x tweets. It was endless and at the time I couldn't understand what was going on. I am now realizing that he was likely behind that in pursuit of his self promotion. It's the only reason I even know who he is so I guess he was successful.
900,2020-02-05 06:58:14,eytom3,Please use his full name. Calling him Nas is disrespectful to hip hop and music in general.

It was a joke song that he turned to real money and fame, but unless you follow him on Twitter you won't keep up with him for a few more months."
902,2020-02-06 13:46:39,eytom3,"Another powerful marketing strategy he used was the original YouTube video he posted of the song.

956,2020-02-04 23:18:14,eytom3,"Could you give a list of maybe 10 people that do this Twitter/Instagram meme page thing to promote their music? Genuinely curious where you got the ""thousands"" number from."
957,2020-02-05 01:37:11,eytom3,"I agree with what you said. Theres luck in everything. Soulja boy got popular from listing his songs under the names of already popular songs, thousands of people were doing the same, yet arent popular. 

The point missing from this post is you need a perfect product before you start selling."
958,2020-02-05 00:07:23,eytom3,"Some of it’s hard work, some might be easy, some simple, but work is work. You’re discounting the element of *talent* too. Lil Nas worked to put himself in the position he was in, he prepared for it, then set the pieces in motion and capitalized on it. He intentionally put himself in the best position possible for “luck” to do its thing. If he hadn’t done any of that work beforehand the song would be a dud because no one would hear it. He put his song in a position so that people could hear it. 

Talent is the second factor. Memes don’t beat Mariah Carey’s billboard #1 record, talent does. Talent gets him hundreds of millions (if not billions) of views/listens. He made a song that people would like, performed it well, and let his plan go to work. 

Lil Nas’s song took off because of talent, preparation, and execution. When talent, preparation, and execution meet luck it’s like a multiplier effect. But if the work/product isn’t good enough the multiplier ain’t gonna be enough. You have to put yourself in the best position so that you can take advantage of a lucky situation, because they happen *all of the time* but nothing happens because no one prepared for it. 

Most social media music artists doing the “same thing” simply suck, and their plan and execution isn’t as good as Lil Nas."
959,2020-02-05 08:12:34,eytom3,"Success is an intersection of skill, hard work and luck."
960,2020-02-05 18:35:50,eytom3,I mean the key element for the song blowing up was that it's a good song and incredibly catchy. That's what separated it from the thousands of others who try the same and it's not luck
961,2020-02-05 19:41:05,eytom3,"> If you really want to dissect it, why did LilNasX's meme videos take off rather than any other person doing the same thing? There are thousands, and thousands of these type of vids posted daily.


Because they were better and lil nas x worked harder?


Its not luck. Maybe some of it was, but 99% of people dont capitalize on their luck and lil nas x did. 



Im a professional musician and have been for over a decade. I was in the right place in the right time once, but past that my hardwork and dedication has taken me this far. Its massively insulting when people attribute other peoples success in specifically artistic fields as “luck”. 


Luck is usually preparation meeting opportunity."
962,2020-02-12 02:29:19,eytom3,"> It's honestly pure luck. Of course he doesn't want to admit this. Every successful person always want to claim hard work... but let's be real. 

What you are alluding to here is [survivorship bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias). 

But to say that this is pure, 100% luck is to be foolish. 

luck is _certainly an element_, but it's not the only element.

The marketing genius here is Nas's THINKING & APPROACH.

The guy is thinking in multiple layers and always trying to compound his previous results into something bigger... slowly, systematically, and steadily WHILE having an intimate understanding of each platform's (Twitter, etc) culture. 

Just because you failed to generate the same results, doesn't mean you should hate/attribute someone else's success to ""pure luck""."

990,2020-02-05 04:25:48,eytom3,Damn shit like this makes me realize just how much music has turned into nothing but money and business for some people.
991,2020-02-05 15:14:59,eytom3,"Album plays aren’t important like individual songs. Number of songs played = money and success on streaming, not album plays.

Kanye has been going with shorter albums for artistic reasons, I think he likes the shorter turnaround on projects"
992,2020-02-05 16:11:13,eytom3,"Hard disagree, I never heard anywhere that was his thinking at all, but I’ve seen lots of reddit posts saying that artists like drake and migos are making albums with 20+ songs because the longer albums actually get more streams, not the shorter ones. Also Kanye’s 7 track albums weren’t very mainstream and don’t have near the same amount of plays as his other albums. Ye was made in 2 weeks and is a very vulnerable project, so I don’t think that was his ideology at all for making it 7 songs."
993,2020-02-05 19:35:22,eytom3,"This is incorrect and nicely shows how reddit will upvote falsehoods. Actually streambaiting is done exactly the opposite way, by loading albums with tons of songs - see Drake’s Scorpion, Migos’ Culture 2, etc"
994,2020-02-05 20:09:35,eytom3,"I have to chime in here, I really don't think Kanye was doing it for the money it was IMO a GOOD summer he produced like 8 albums all which came out in like a 2 week span. Even JIK is longer than 7 tracks."
995,2020-02-05 20:15:27,eytom3,This could not be more wrong
996,2020-02-05 20:17:31,eytom3,This is literally untrue. Pusha T said the reason why is [because](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://djbooth.net/.amp/features/2018-05-25-pusha-t-kanye-west-seven-track-albums&ved=2ahUKEwjssMmnnLvnAhUJCawKHV1qA58QFjACegQIBxAB&usg=AOvVaw2StoW_f1vFTKLDD1kHNqBE&ampcf=1) they were hearing all of Drake/migos albums that were 20 songs each and wanted quality over quantity on their next projects. Always thought the sentiment that reddit talks out of their ass with confidence was untrue until this post smh
997,2020-02-05 20:30:42,eytom3,Kanyes album is the worst example for this. The album is short and thus gets way less streams than for example Drakes last 3 albums which all have 20+ songs.
998,2020-02-05 20:53:24,eytom3,"This can be seen as a reason, but wasn't the main reason Kanye released 7 track albums. The actual thinking behind them was to cut the filler, similar to Drake's scorpion that has an excessive runtime for more streams."
999,2020-02-05 14:29:43,eytom3,"Well I've also seen bands that only put out EPs because it's better quality control for their songs. Our Last Night specifically referred to this, something along the lines of ""there are/were less songs we regret/dont like when we put out an EP vs an LP""."
1000,2020-02-05 15:12:09,eytom3,Elvis’ Teddy Bear and The Letter by the Box Tops are both under two minutes. They’d get more plays on radio back then because in radio air time = money.

1002,2020-02-05 19:49:23,eytom3,it’s kinda different but okay
1003,2020-02-05 20:56:47,eytom3,"This is wrong, 1 album play does not equal one stream. Its based on song plays within the album, not total album plays"
1004,2020-02-05 21:57:48,eytom3,"7 tracks is just an EP, that's nothing new. 7 tracks isn't some new standard for Kanye either, JIK is a full length album. Ye is short because Kanye also recorded Kids See Ghosts and produced Nasir, KTSE, and Daytona all during the same period at a ranch in Wyoming during a manic episode and didn't have time for full length albums.

The way Billboard counts plays actually hurts short projects in terms of album sales, but is good for short songs. That's why there are some 20+ track albums from artists like the Migos and Drake that absolutely just drag on."
1005,2020-02-05 22:41:14,eytom3,"Nah that's false, Kanye was on the verge of his christian resurgence and became friendly of the number 7 because that's the number of perfection in the bible.

In reality longer albums have been the trend, look at [Chris Brown doing a 45 tracks album](https://open.spotify.com/album/3zak0kNLcOY5vFcB3Ipskp?si=P2iIfHHYQtOIFIlV8lj2_g) or a [30 something one](https://open.spotify.com/album/3okhA6w5uau6ZNhnVpwVww?si=2p39VrAdSui2kkZmt8SuSg) 

And you can see that trend on Migos' Culture 2, Post Malone, Drake's Scorpion, XXXTentacion ""? Deluxe"" and Bad Vibes Forever, etc.

Longer albums gets you more chances to get a song into a playlist and even If u listened one you gave them 1hr of playing time.

Kanye's doing the total opposite as an artistic choice and I don't expect everyone to know this because I'm a big fan, but Kanye scraps A LOT of music, he's unreleased library from just 2018 and 2019 is more than what he actually released, If he wanted to make longer albums he would have done it by now, but he don't care about sales anymore."
1006,2020-02-05 23:13:47,eytom3,Well if he put out longer albums that were still good he would get much more hours of play.
1007,2020-02-06 00:27:45,eytom3,"That’s not how it works. A single song streamed 1,500 times = album  sale. So a 10 track album streamed by 150 people = sale. Or a 20 track album streamed by 150 people = 2 sales."
1008,2020-02-05 15:36:45,eytom3,"Sheet music / Tin Pan Alley / Denmark St changed the type of music we listened to.

Records changed the type of music we listened to.

Radio changed the type of music we listened to. 

iTunes/MP3s changed the type of music we listened to.

The next form of music distribution will change the type of music we listen. It’s just evolution."

Even when other versions of the song were released, I don't believe they where played very much, and instead just helped keep the Cyrus remix in people's mind."

1034,2020-02-05 16:58:19,eytom3,I think the more telling stat would be how many came from there before it became a big song so the first month or so. Obviously once it was number one most of them wouldn’t come from there.

1041,2020-02-05 22:01:27,eytom3,"You don't understand then. 

To say ""this was no accident"" means it was intentional. To say it was intentional is to imply that there could be only one outcome. To assume that that was the natural and only possible progression of things is hindsight bias. To ignore the luck involved in this case is survivorship bias. But who wants to talk about luck when being calculated, hard working and resilient make a more sexy story?"

1046,2020-02-05 18:52:43,eytom3,"People have been trying to use memes for so long, I remember reading an editorial a few years ago about a meme account that was hired by a label to slip in songs from them into memes to get them to blow up. While it's not easy to just list 10 examples, I've been closely following the meteoric rise of hip hop back into the top genre and as early as 2014 people were trying to start viral challenges using songs, a notable early and successful example being Rae Srenmurd's song Black Beatles being used for ""the mannequin challenge"". I remember Katy Perry trying (and failing) to force one of these challenges for her songs two years later. Especially with the advent of tik tok and artists being signed after having successful meme exposure (see Sueco the Child), I can see everyone trying to get big thru these means"

You should look under the curtain of the music industry some time. It's ugly. If talent meant anything at all, the scene would be an entirely different thing. Talent means nothing in the music industry. There are literally thousands of more talented people than those who made it. Trust me.

Behind every great artists you see, there is a room of 10 more talented people writing the songs and pitching them for peanuts."
1049,2020-03-10 16:41:30,eytom3,"Talent lol. He makes music by morons, for morons, and that demographic is exceedingly large. I always tell myself I wish I could relate to people that stupid; the ones that can become rich!!"
1050,2020-02-05 19:38:07,eytom3,"And to make a song that is catchy and good, is not a science. There is no formula for that... so it really is luck to have created a catchy song.

I promise you, every musician *does* think their song is good and catchy when they release it. No one releases a song saying ""this isn't good"""
1051,2020-02-05 20:11:47,eytom3,"I, too, have been a professional musician... and pretty successful at that. I've played the largest festivals including Lollapalooza, Summerfest, Tomorrowland, etc.

In the old days you had to optimize for the physical characteristics of a record. e.g. by putting a good song at the beginning of both sides so listeners get drawn in no matter what side they put it on. Or, clustering good songs at the beginning of the side where the grooves gave better sound quality."

If you ain’t got money coming in, you can’t make quality deep cuts.  Some say it’s poor art to make things for mainstream play, but without mainstream money you ain’t got time or funds to put into your art ideas.  You gotta get good at both."
1102,2020-02-05 21:33:43,eytom3,"Artists need money to survive, and since people have stopped paying for music for the most part and only listen on places like Spotify or Youtube they need to game that system just to stay on par."

My interpretation of his comments were that he believes his fans would get more joy out of a 7 track album because 1. Quality over quantity 2. You get to listen to more of the album in a short amount of time and you dont get fatigue from a longer album.

1113,2020-02-05 19:21:44,eytom3,"But everyone here is saying longer albums are just filled with filler songs which would mean people just skip over a lot of songs anyway and not necessarily stream them. The amount of sales relies completely on the artist and the quality of their work (or reputation). Migos have a album out that is 40 songs. By your logic Migos should blow Drake out of the water. But the don’t even come close.

And if you ask me 5/7 of the songs on “Ye” we filler.

Kanye sold much better when his music was *much* better."

1122,2020-02-05 06:44:18,eytom3,"For some context, Billboard originally claimed he got bumped because he 'wasn't a country artist' which is odd because the only song he'd really made up to this point that anyone knew about was OTR. So in the music video of the remix that has Billy Rae in it when they first roll up to the house and Lil Nas X makes the comment about how they treated him last time he was there, it's referring to how Billboard had bumped him. Then Billy Rae reassures him it'll be alright because now Lil Nas is with him, referring to the fact that now they can't bump you because I'm a household country name.

There are a few other small details in the video that have hidden meaning like that. Honestly, it was creative as hell."

1137,2020-02-05 08:40:54,eytom3,"Dude. He thought to himself, like I did in 2011 when I first had the same idea, ""how can I sell something online?""

First thought was, well, I have to build an audience. So you say to yourself, how do I do that, and do it quickly?

With social media, twitter to be exact, best way was creating a parody account of a celebrity and cracking jokes and memes. This was in 2011. By 2012 it was the biggest thing on Twitter for everyone doing it that understood it. 

Once you had build your following, which you do by sharing retweets with other accounts or with your own accounts, you then sell products, sell OTHERS products, have a website with ads, etc. 

Lil Nas X went with music, which he had already been doing, and was the goal of his to begin with. He built the page like many of us had with the goal already of using it as promotion for something else. That was the goal right from the beginning. So it WAS the other way around. 

I have pages with over 5 million followers combined. I've gone viral with shit a bunch of times over, have stuff quoted in WSJ, to Sports Illustrated to ESPN to CNN and beyond. What Lil Nas X did, to a tee, is what many of us do on a lower scale every day. He just went ultra cosmic space man viral with his shot and turned it into a fire burning lotto ticket. The product he was pushing was actually good enough to be a hit as well. He had a great combo of great promo and great product all at the RIGHT TIME. Its still a one in a zillion shot, it still is lucky that it picks up and that people accept it as good. Its not completely manufactured as OP is kinda saying. You still never know if its going to work."
1138,2020-02-05 02:27:14,eytom3,"it is also **talent**, yeah the stunt of making a country song was different to a certain degree. But I've worked with musicians before (sound engineer) and some are very talented on instruments but cannot make a song come together. Others cannot accept creative criticism and can't work with other people. And most can't make a song worthy of a radio edit. While these can all be great artists and they can be very talented in making epic songs, they didn't have an in towards reaching people with their music.

So yeah Mariah Carey got to #1 status but she was sort of also groomed into the music career, once someone recognized her talent of singing. To know someone's story like nasX is quite interesting since going viral is luck he kept trying... while others assume they post one tweet and it should be viral in an hour, and then look dumbfound on why Reddit didn't upvote a post.

I even want to note he released it on Dec 3rd, around the time before families gather but kids are still in school. This gave it a chance to go viral on a small level and then spread as people in America travel, then he kept releasing more until Dec 24th. The timing of this even had to have some assistance IMO, as being at family gatherings and hearing cousins, uncles and etc talk about buzz feed crap others have seen that they enjoyed recently."

You unpack their structure and you see how she made those pick up radio play: they’re made of memorable ear worms rather than 1 or 2 so people can constantly cycle through them in their head. It also didn’t hurt that she was on top of the world at that point, but those could have been way smaller hits and been career-closing had they not been so optimized for pop radio on both the American and global scale."

Out of all the vapid and annoying pop songs out there, OTR really ain't that bad.  It's got a fairly unique sonic signature: interesting sample, decent beat, good vocal performance, catchy hooks.  Lyrically, it's not as banal as pop music usually is.

1207,2020-02-05 19:26:38,eytom3,"As a musician this haunts me. In my own experience, most bands sophomore album is the best. 

First albums tend to come with a lot of musical baggage, riffs, lyrics and song ideas that have been floating around for years or recycled from other projects. 

By the second album you get fresh music that has a more distinct voice, with the polish that comes from all of those musicians playing all those shows together, and really locking in. The song writing, imo, is usually more coherent and generally, the artists themselves are far more comfortable which makes everything sound more natural and less forced."
1208,2020-02-05 21:05:05,eytom3,"By that logic what’s stopping dedicated fans from just streaming a 7 track Kanye album over and over? It doesn’t matter how much of a dedicated fan you are, not everyone can/will continuously stream a 1 1/2 hour album over and over. Scorpion stay one the top of the charts for over a year and for the most part it was a variety of songs.

Sure initial streaming numbers can be boosted, but after an album has been successful for a while you can’t really attribute it to the number of songs.

And I’m sure JIK is worse, but I didn’t listen to it so I can’t judge it. JIK also has a large audience, I know some of my older aunts that have listened to it which I never thought I’d see."

Now he, again a country singer, is a huge part in creating one of the biggest and most succesful records ever in a time where hip-hop is dominating the charts and on a mostly trap-inspired track. He goes on to get back in the spotlight, reignite a fame of his own in an entirely new generation, perform on the biggest hip-hop festival stages in the world and win 2 grammys while at it.

1225,2020-02-05 18:43:48,eytom3,"I'm not sure what AAA games are precisely since it can hard to differentiate from AA games.  I just have a hard time playing games like Battlefield or Infinite Warfare.  Even the new Jedi game is hard for me to get into because it feels so samey to games I've played years ago.  I say this even though I love the fact that Halo MCC is on PC now 

Arkham asylum was great, but by the time Dark Knight came out I could barely finish the game since I played 3 other batman games.  Heck even a game like Mad Max had similar combat and upgrades.  Was just harder for me to get into.

I've transitioned into games from Paradox and other strategy games, rogue like games, and racing games such as Forza Horizon 4 and F1 2019.

Now whether this is because it is something new and something I'm not bored of yet or something that is just different I don't know yet.  But it is the smaller games that have a unique idea that really make me keep going back."
1226,2020-02-05 19:07:25,eytom3,"And the same goes for music as well. There's are so many underground musicians who stick a lot more to their artistic vision make music for the art rather than for the money. 

The difference isn't anywhere near as stark as in video games though but that may just be due to shear volume of musicians. With so many people making music, you're bound to get more interesting and authentic mainstream artists. But it also means the underground is massively rich."

1243,2020-02-05 19:56:00,eytom3,"To me, that's exactly why second albums are so much better. 

By the time a band has gotten to that second album, they've (hopefully) played a ton of shows together, played with numerous bands in their genre and scene, and really started to hone in on their voice. Second albums come so much faster because the musicians know what they are doing. 

It's hard to quantify, but a single live show is worth at least 10 practices, to me anyways. So imagine a band touring their first album for 8 months, that whole time they are just getting better and better all while writing new, more focused music. They get back, and they have six months to finish writing, rehearse, and test new songs live. The key difference here, is that (normally) these musicians no longer have day jobs by this point and the amount of time that can actually be spent working on music suddenly goes from 15 hours a week to 40+. Tracking an album takes, maybe a few weeks total. They aren't writing in the studio, they are just sitting down and recording songs they've been working on constantly for the last 6+ months. 

I'm definitely not saying that first albums are bad, just in my experience, most bands I know are somewhat disappointed in their first album because it's almost impossible to do exactly what you intend to do on your first try. 

The second album is a bands chance to say, ""This is what we are really trying to achieve."" They've learned from all the mistakes on their first album, they are tighter and more developed as musicians, and they've found their voice. I like to use a bands second album to determine whether or not I like the band or just ""That one song."" 

And honestly, the reality of it is that by the time you hear that really good ""First Album"" it's probably their second or third-- half the band has probably been playing together for years in a different project that has 3 albums, then they changed bass players and band names and put out their ""First Album"".  

To quote the movie Selena ""It takes 10 years to become an overnight success."""

It’s not that I don’t trust you, I agree that more numbers can help boost streaming numbers. I just think it’s disingenuous to chalk the album’ success up to the numbers argument when you consider...

1) If you go through Drakes discography. All of his albums average at least an hour. Literally every single one is an 1 hour+

Thank Me Later -1:01, Take Care -1:27, NWTS -1:08, IYRTITL -1:09, Views -1:21, More Life -1:22, Scorpion -1:30

He’s just an artist that makes long albums. And it’s never really been held against him until like the Views era, when streaming became prominent.

2. The BI article you cited doesn’t really expand on anything outside of what we’ve already discussed. Sure God’s Plan and In My Feelings boosted his numbers, but that still would have remained true if he shaved 10 songs off the project.

3. I don’t really take Push seriously. He wasn’t singing that tune when TLOP dropped with 20 songs and was an 1:09 run time. I think he said that primarily as a way to shade Drake, especially considering the timing. (Though I am a big Drake fan so take that for what it is.)

4. Even if you throw filler songs on an album, unless have some type of value, people aren’t going to stream them. Even diehard fans wouldn’t come back and touch them after a week or two if they are truly “filler”. So if you have a bunch of “filler” songs that people are still streaming the fuck out of two months later, are they really filler?

5. The only thing I’d say longer albums have a leg up on is giving the artist more chances to throw a song on there that people might love. But that can also be a bad thing, because if you have a long stretch of mid-songs that will discourage people from continuing.

At the end of the day I think a lot of people drummed you this filler nonsense to take away from the fact that the album had a lot of people that organically enjoyed it and listened to it. Even Lil Wayne hasn’t pulled anywhere near Drakes numbers and C5 was 23 songs and a 1:30 too.  Not just anyone can compose 25 songs on an album and hit a billion streams."

Yeah sometimes. But, for example, Otto Klemperer does Mahler 2 the way Mahler intended for it to be. Slowly. But I’ll be damned if I don’t prefer Bernstein’s *way* more lively version with New York Phil.

But what the hell do I know. I grew up on hardcore punk."
1292,2020-02-05 17:18:07,eytom3,Smells like thinly veiled xenophobia
1293,2020-02-05 18:50:49,eytom3,"I can give you children if you want? I got black, Asian, white. All types really. Maybe we can chalk up a deal?"
1294,2020-02-05 17:37:58,eytom3,"Yeah, I like that they carried the tongue-in-cheek over to what they say too, like they totally know you won but Hades told them to pretend you lost, so they all pretend you lost.  They could have just left the default loss lines, but they didn't and that's why I love Supergiant."
1295,2020-02-05 21:35:42,eytom3,"Honestly I could go either way for Switch or PC with STS. Portability would be huge for the game, and there are literally hundreds of hours  in vanilla alone if you're like... average at video games just to get to ascension 20 on everyone."
1296,2020-02-07 20:14:13,eytom3,I don't post much but just wanted to also say Slay The Spire is the best game I've ever played. The replayability and challenge tied to short gaming bursts make it fantastic. I also taught my 1st grader math concepts and also a lesson in patience and trying again from playing the game. Would recommend it to everyone!
1297,2020-02-05 18:52:45,eytom3,"Look at my edit too cause you're not getting out of this without hearing the chicken song.


Are they prime working children here or..?"
1298,2020-02-05 21:34:34,eytom3,"There is *so much* fucking care put into Hades and it's voicelines. I don't really like the gameplay itself, kinda repetitive after a bit, but I will genuinely play for hours just to see what new stuff the characters have to say to me every playthrough."
1299,2020-02-05 18:56:57,eytom3,"Hahaha I think I remember hearing that when I was a kid. To answer your other question, the Asians seem to be really fast good workers and came make Nike shoes from scrap in minutes. The rest fail to live up to the Asians standards and are thus appropriately hit with a long stick until I'm bored."
1300,2020-02-05 21:44:33,eytom3,"Yeah, it's cool to see their knack for story-telling and character building carry over to a game like this."

1306,2020-02-03 17:40:43,ey8ikx,BTS chose Jungkook as the member who buys all types of useless and weird gadgets lol. That's too cute
1307,2020-02-03 16:00:17,ey8ikx,Ashton hyung 😂
1308,2020-02-03 17:48:28,ey8ikx,"The throwing things pisses me off so much. You’re actively hurting the people you allegedly like and are there to support, I just don’t get why people can’t see it’s so wrong."
1309,2020-02-03 16:48:14,ey8ikx,Poor hobi ...lets not throw things at our boys
1310,2020-02-03 17:58:31,ey8ikx,"Please no throwing things. ): 

Also, all those JK posts really shows off how cute he is. His little quirks are adorable and idk if he’s even aware of all of them! And him buying all those ad items! 😂 that’d be me if I had money. Lmao 

And you’d have to get Jimin’s approval to marry V first dearie.  Lol ^joking ^not ^really"
1311,2020-02-03 20:19:11,ey8ikx,"Just when I was getting over how good Joon looked at the grammys, and plz can fans leave throwing stuff on stage in the last decade"
1312,2020-02-04 00:41:31,ey8ikx,I'm Jin height so I find it crazy when I see male idols standing next to girl groups. They always look so tall in their own videos.
1313,2020-02-03 21:27:06,ey8ikx,"Argh, I’ve seen the full videos of both Hobi and Jin getting hit and although Hobi smiled, when he turned from a diff angle u can see him rubbing his eyes and he was hurt. 

On the other hand Jin was Absolutely NOT happy with whoever threw the toy, pretty sure if he gave me that look, I’d be forever disappointed in myself."
1314,2020-02-03 16:04:22,ey8ikx,Oh honey
1315,2020-02-03 17:12:16,ey8ikx,Last comment in that post ain't funny at all. That's some sasaeng level of shit.
1316,2020-02-03 18:48:51,ey8ikx,Only they missed him covering his ears when embarrassed :)
1317,2020-02-04 01:42:47,ey8ikx,"There used to be tall girl groups but I guess the confirmed trend is cute/petite. Even the girl crush concept has been mixed with cute now. Previous girl crush concepts were fierce/sexy. 

The only active relatively tall girl group is Gfriend."
1318,2020-02-03 23:01:07,ey8ikx,I love that Jin doesn't put up with people's shit

1320,2020-02-03 17:47:12,ey8ikx,I think that was a bof*/f4 joke. A bit poor in taste but a scenario from a k-drama.

1324,2020-02-03 14:53:00,ey86tp,Distrokid - you have to accept the option paying to make it available for IG stories and such - I would assume thats how Tik-Tok gets their music
1325,2020-02-03 15:59:47,ey86tp,What don’t you like about RouteNote?
1326,2020-02-03 15:07:17,ey86tp,I'm not sure that there is a free distributor other than rn. Tiktok might want to keep audio quality strong on its platform

1329,2020-02-03 20:00:06,ey86tp,"They don’t pay as much as they say, the customer service is really slow and the site is broken"
1330,2020-02-03 19:43:37,ey86tp,Is songtradr trustworthy with all the licensing stuff? Also will I be able to pick the part of the song I want on Tik Tok?
1331,2020-02-03 20:12:25,ey86tp,"Dude if you’re not even willing to invest 20 bucks a year into your own art for unlimited song uploads?

You might as well just quit right now 🤷🏽‍♂️"
1332,2020-02-03 15:37:41,ey86tp,"$20 year is well worth it, considering if you use a free distro who takes a percentage, you'll end up paying way more than $20 if the track blows up on TikTok"

No one was paying attention in the crossroads of New York as I was giving my speech.

""M-m-mine...""

However, one person was intrigued in what I was saying.

""M-m-m-minecraft...""

Then it was just a domino effect, ten more people are watching.

""Minecraft...""

A hundred were now watching, this had caught the attention of even the busy drivers in rush hour. Their faces in anticipation, some were even scared. Others were complaining that this isn't the real deal.

""MINECRAFT...""

But they all suddenly started cheering, shaking, praying. When they heard my tone, my pitch, my timbre.... they all knew what was going to come next. They realized... that salvation of the human race has finally come.

""Minecraft good Fortnite bad""

And then the silence broke

""OOOIOIIUUUUUGHHHhJJHHHHHWAASEAAAa//::""

Thousands of people fell to their knees, yelling orgasmically. People starting crying tears of joy, others were running and thanking God, News reporters were already on the scene, broadcasting the entire thing nationwide and consequently the entire world. Hundreds of people came out of their cars, buses, taxis, stores, and subway stations hooting and hollering. It was a miracle unfolding.

I started to say the next sentence relayed to me by our Lord and Savior.

""M-m-mi... Mine...""

Already some people fainted at just the mere sound of my voice. Even more people came. Some were jumping from planes thousands of feet in the air, others ran or swam miles to here in mere seconds. I think I even spotted a few famous people.

""MINE...""

Nearly a million people were here now. There's now Europeans, Canadians, Mexicans, Latin Americans, West Coasters, Africans, and even several Asians and one Australian. They were screaming hysterically, bringing gifts for me, taking pictures and videos. Fireworks and confetti everywhere, helicopters, and even Donald Trump was here with his family bowing down to me.

""MINEC-C-C-CRAFT *voice crack*""

A billion people were here now. Even animals from all over the world were coming in herds. I could see Pewdiepie &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; Martiza, Elon Musk, Keanu Reeves, Lil Nas X, 50 Cent, Oprah Winfrey, the Kardashians, and so many other people. Many people were having seizures, heart attacks, and strokes from the sheer excitement, and some were being trampled to death because of the huge crowd. The screaming was deafening. Some just came straight out of their bathroom, school, work, or their parenting... but it doesn't matter now.

""MMMMMMIIIIINNNNEEECRAAAFTTTTT""

No matter what was your race, gender, ethnicity, sexuality, religion, economic class, etc... it didn't matter. All of humanity has come together for this one moment. Millions of people have died to due plane crashes, car crashes, doctors abandoning their patients, parents abandoning their children... just to be here, but it will all be worth it.

Nearly half of humanity is here now. Even the dead came out their graves for this. Everyone is climbing on top of each other and on the walls of skyscrapers since they couldn't fit. So many lights, music, dancing, feasts... yet barely a minute passed. Humanity is very interesting.

10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...

I look at the smiling faces of the crowd in front of me. I look at the death and destruction that came from sacrifice to attend this event. This is it. We're ready.

Billions of people around the world disintegrated into their pure chemical compounds that composed their bodies, then their atoms, then their protons/neutrons/electrons, and finally their quarks... as they heard that holy sentence. The distant echoes of yelling can heard from thousands of miles. This... this was their ultimate purpose in life. This is the culmination of everything that has happened in human history, it is reason why life even existed in the first place. They weren't screaming in terror, they were shouting in orgasmic joy. They could finally die happy. Their entire lives flashed before their eyes as they saw their loved ones. They saw their ultimate fantasy. They can finally be freed from their imperfect bodies in this imperfect world. 

The Sun blinked out. The Moon crashed into the Earth. The Earth turned into dust. The Solar System collapsed into a state of entropy. The Milky Way hosts a firework show of supernovas. All the galaxies of the universe colliding with one another. Reality is falling apart. That's because reality doesn't need to exist anymore. It has reached its goal. Spacetime has fallen. Matter ceases to exist. Not even the concept of nothing exists. The universe was never born.

Humanity is gone. Everything is gone. We are now one. Evil doesn't exist anymore. Insecurities don't exist anymore.  Fear, sadness, anger don't exist anymore. Just hope, love, and harmony for eternity. This is what we were meant to be. This is our final evolution stage.

This is heaven. This is what it means to be happy.

Congratulations."

1367,2020-02-03 04:39:31,ey1czw,Tonight being on the best list while Physical is on the meh surprised me (I like them both I just didn't see him enjoying Tonight). He wasn't really into Don't Start Now either so I guess it was to be expected
1368,2020-02-03 04:53:16,ey1czw,"For everyone wondering about Physical: He said Dua feels like a generic, less risky early Lady Gaga on this track"
1369,2020-02-03 05:39:23,ey1czw,"melon back at it again with the mixed takes - Kesha deservingly being in the best section, but for Dua only a ‘meh’?"
1370,2020-02-03 05:25:09,ey1czw,"I don't think fantano is truly ""getting"" Dua and what she is trying to do. That the ""safeness"" is actually pretty risky for a pop girl. 

By deciding to go unabashedly pop she is becoming different than any other pop girl in the public eye right now. It is weird that he praises Carly for her fun pop but then Dua does a similar thing and he says she is trying to be ""safe""."
1371,2020-02-03 06:10:30,ey1czw,"I loved Don’t Start Now, but I’m also feeling kinda meh towards Physical.

Also Tonight is starting to seem like a very divisive track for Kesha."

1374,2020-02-03 11:15:41,ey1czw,Tonight is kinda experimental/messy yet fun for a pop record that's why I'm not surprised he liked it.
1375,2020-02-03 16:51:39,ey1czw,I can't wait for this sub's reaction to him inevitably panning Future Nostalgia
1376,2020-02-03 12:08:24,ey1czw,"That's because Carly has an incredibly distinctive style. Dua's output is excellent rn, but it lacks an easily identifiable personality."
1377,2020-02-03 08:50:33,ey1czw,"I agree with you, but I still feel like he had a point that the hook is pretty bland. Maybe not enough of a flaw to drag it down to ""meh"" (the instrumentation really is top tier, and frankly I'm a sucker for a retro throwback track), but I've been seeing a lot of comparisons to Into You or Teenage Dream or whatever in terms of mastering that safe pop sound, which is a height that I feel it doesn't *quite* reach due to the aforementioned problem. If they spent a little more time tinkering with the melodies in the chorus, it would easily be one of my favourite new tracks in a while, but right now I think it feels a little unsatisfying."
1378,2020-02-03 16:57:04,ey1czw,"Totally, his take on Dua is confusing

IIRC he also said her voice was generic and she could be replaced by any vocalist on her own songs. At the opposite, I feel like one of her best assets is her smoky voice that sets her apart from people like Camila, Halsey etc."
1379,2020-02-03 07:34:43,ey1czw,"I think Physical is a lot of fun, but seeing the endless hype before I listened to it kind of set me up for disappointment. It’s catchy and well-produced, but it’s not transcendent."
1380,2020-02-04 00:48:15,ey1czw,"Exactly, it was not life changing but it was really good"
1381,2020-02-03 03:58:59,ey0s0i,I think he's just reacting to the fact that Old Town Road came back to #2

It's a bit funky, but I thought it's clearer to just keep the cut-off time according to KST and not move it around according to different time zones. Both to keep it clear for everyone else and also to save my one (1) brain cell the extra work.

1442,2020-02-02 05:38:34,execxn,"What do you guys think about Love The Way You Lie? When I first sort of passively listened to it, I thought ""damn, this might literally be the most grossly insensitive thing I've ever heard"". The second time I listened and paid a bit more attention I was like ""okay, maybe there's *some* mature presentation of violent relationships"", and by the third time I listened I was very conflicted. Like, the Rihanna part sounds great, and lyrically works pretty well, explaining the almost stockholm-syndromey nature of a lot of violent relationships and apologism for one's abuser in an intelligent and understandable way. The Eminem parts... Ehhhhhh. I think he does a good job in the second verse of presenting the dude he’s portraying as a total psycho asshole, yet in a somewhat sympathetic light to avoid the black and white presentation you see in a lot of media. Abusers aren't necessarily evil villains from a cartoon, they're often just normal looking people, which is why it can be so hard to spot. But then he says shit like this in the final verse:

> If she ever tries to fucking leave again, I'm a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire

I mean, I *get* that he's portraying a bad person, and it's important to beef that fact up in the final verse or else I think the song would sound too apologetic towards Eminem’s character, but jesus, did we really need to devolve into the violence porn at the end? It's like when TV shows or movies show violent rape scenes or kids viscerally committing suicide in media aimed at teenagers. It's not an *endorsement*, necessarily, but when you consider Eminem's audience, it feels pretty glamourised. People *like* it when Eminem gets angry and gross and violent, so regardless of his intentions, it still feels immature, in the same way that the media reporting on names of school shooters encourages more school shooters, even though it's actively condemned. I wanna know how other people think about this song."

1478,2020-02-23 06:12:12,execxn,"I know this is old but I was just browsing the rate and saw this. It faded from the public mind very quick for such a controversial superstar moment. Rihanna was only one year removed from Chris Brown's abuse when it dropped and people did NOT take kindly to her singing ""I like the way it hurts"". She had a lot of people making memes saying she enjoyed Chris's abuse or didn't care etc. and it didn't help that she did initially take him back then would take him back again briefly about 3 years later. 

Eminem's abuse has been well documented by himself, both in having an abusive mother, absent father and being violent toward his ex-wife Kim. So it's definitely interesting and compelling to see two people on the opposite sides of the issue come together like this and examine what they've experienced first hand. 

Sometimes I think certain pieces of media are too complex or layered for mainstream audiences. Artists are people who seek answers through their own artistic expression and use music to figure out how they feel about something. No one can tell Rihanna (and to a lesser extent) Eminem how they should go about handling a song that depicts something so personally lived-in. This is what Rihanna wanted to do at this point in her life and career so she obviously felt it reflected her state of mind. Eminem too (I'm treating him as a secondary because he was the violent one in this case so it's decidedly less important what he thinks even though I guess it is somewhat vital to understand how abusers think about their partner)."

1640,2020-03-16 00:05:52,fjatx6,i like that all these celebs like ac now. can’t believe people still try to say AC is niche.
1641,2020-03-16 02:14:42,fjatx6,"I checked, and it’s actually a real tweet. I’m honestly surprised"
1642,2020-03-16 01:26:52,fjatx6,I really hope he posts pics of him playing lol
1643,2020-03-16 02:12:20,fjatx6,I love how likes are called “vind-ik-leuks” in Dutch lol
1644,2020-03-16 02:05:10,fjatx6,Na😂 did he actually tweet that?
1645,2020-03-16 06:03:34,fjatx6,Since all stores shut down on Wednesday I can’t actually go and get AC and DOOM so rip me
1646,2020-03-16 16:45:31,fjatx6,If his island doesn’t have any horse villagers I won’t be happy.
1647,2020-03-16 15:06:21,fjatx6,He’s keeping them in the back.
1648,2020-03-16 04:57:11,fjatx6,"The only people who would still say it's niche are the people who (for whatever reason) only enjoy games and things that are niche, like the kind of people who like a niche band and gatekeep it from anyone else because they like it being less popular. No idea why"
1649,2020-03-16 16:28:16,fjatx6,Generally all of his screenshotted tweets are real. He’s kinda hilarious
1650,2020-03-16 06:04:57,fjatx6,"Ngl I'd watch him stream, he's a funny dude"
1651,2020-03-16 16:05:31,fjatx6,Digital is the safest way to buy stuff now
1652,2020-03-16 05:38:52,fjatx6,I feel like “real” gamers like to say AC is niche. Like DOTA and League and etc are the only “real” games.
1653,2020-03-16 06:58:12,fjatx6,"I'm personally against saying things like ""The only people who do x are y"". It just sounds really scummy to group everyone up like that, especially for the purposes of talking down to them."
1654,2020-03-17 02:02:12,fjatx6,"Tbh, I've mostly heard the super fans from the bigger Nintendo franchises say AC is niche. My guess is their jealous that animal crossing is creeping up behind them."
1655,2020-03-16 14:09:54,fjatx6,"I was talking about the people that like to gatekeep and talk down to everyone else, but I understand what you're saying."
1656,2020-04-21 10:12:27,g5clj6," ""M-m... M""  No one was paying attention in the crossroads of New York as I was giving my speech.  ""M-m-mine...""  However, one person was intrigued in what I was saying.  ""M-m-m-minecraft...""  Then it was just a domino effect, ten more people are watching.  ""Minecraft...""  A hundred were now watching, this had caught the attention of even the busy drivers in rush hour. Their faces in anticipation, some were even scared. Others were complaining that this isn't the real deal.  ""MINECRAFT...""  But they all suddenly started cheering, shaking, praying. When they heard my tone, my pitch, my timbre.... they all knew what was going to come next. They realized... that salvation of the human race has finally come.  ""Minecraft good Fortnite bad""  And then the silence broke  ""OOOIOIIUUUUUGHHHhJJHHHHHWAASEAAAa//::""  Thousands of people fell to their knees, yelling orgasmically. People starting crying tears of joy, others were running and thanking God, News reporters were already on the scene, broadcasting the entire thing nationwide and consequently the entire world. Hundreds of people came out of their cars, buses, taxis, stores, and subway stations hooting and hollering. It was a miracle unfolding.  I started to say the next sentence relayed to me by our Lord and Savior.  ""M-m-mi... Mine...""  Already some people fainted at just the mere sound of my voice. Even more people came. Some were jumping from planes thousands of feet in the air, others ran or swam miles to here in mere seconds. I think I even spotted a few famous people.  ""MINE...""  Nearly a million people were here now. There's now Europeans, Canadians, Mexicans, Latin Americans, West Coasters, Africans, and even several Asians and one Australian. They were screaming hysterically, bringing gifts for me, taking pictures and videos. Fireworks and confetti everywhere, helicopters, and even Donald Trump was here with his family bowing down to me.  ""MINEC-C-C-CRAFT voice crack""  A billion people were here now. Even animals from all over the world were coming in herds. I could see Pewdiepie &amp;amp;amp;amp; Martiza, Elon Musk, Keanu Reeves, Lil Nas X, 50 Cent, Oprah Winfrey, the Kardashians, and so many other people. Many people were having seizures, heart attacks, and strokes from the sheer excitement, and some were being trampled to death because of the huge crowd. The screaming was deafening. Some just came straight out of their bathroom, school, work, or their parenting... but it doesn't matter now.  ""MMMMMMIIIIINNNNEEECRAAAFTTTTT""  No matter what was your race, gender, ethnicity, sexuality, religion, economic class, etc... it didn't matter. All of humanity has come together for this one moment. Millions of people have died to due plane crashes, car crashes, doctors abandoning their patients, parents abandoning their children... just to be here, but it will all be worth it.  Nearly half of humanity is here now. Even the dead came out their graves for this. Everyone is climbing on top of each other and on the walls of skyscrapers since they couldn't fit. So many lights, music, dancing, feasts... yet barely a minute passed. Humanity is very interesting.  10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...  I look at the smiling faces of the crowd in front of me. I look at the death and destruction that came from sacrifice to attend this event. This is it. We're ready.  0.  ""Minecraft good Fortnite bad Instagram normie Emojis bad Keanu breathtaking Wholesome 100 [Everyone liked that] Area 51 PETA bad 69 nice 420""  ""AaAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAyyyYYYYYYYYYYYyaYayaYaASyAAaYaaYayaAAAaaUGgGHHhHHhhHHhhHHh😩😩👅👄👀🥵🥵mmmmMMMMmMmMMMMMMMMM😭🤯😱😂🤣😍🤪💦hhhhhhHhFFFfffF""  Billions of people around the world disintegrated into their pure chemical compounds that composed their bodies, then their atoms, then their protons/neutrons/electrons, and finally their quarks... as they heard that holy sentence. The distant echoes of yelling can heard from thousands of miles. This... this was their ultimate purpose in life. This is the culmination of everything that has happened in human history, it is reason why life even existed in the first place. They weren't screaming in terror, they were shouting in orgasmic joy. They could finally die happy. Their entire lives flashed before their eyes as they saw their loved ones. They saw their ultimate fantasy. They can finally be freed from their imperfect bodies in this imperfect world.  The Sun blinked out. The Moon crashed into the Earth. The Earth turned into dust. The Solar System collapsed into a state of entropy. The Milky Way hosts a firework show of supernovas. All the galaxies of the universe colliding with one another. Reality is falling apart. That's because reality doesn't need to exist anymore. It has reached its goal. Spacetime has fallen. Matter ceases to exist. Not even the concept of nothing exists. The universe was never born.  Humanity is gone. Everything is gone. We are now one. Evil doesn't exist anymore. Insecurities don't exist anymore. Fear, sadness, anger don't exist anymore. Just hope, love, and harmony for eternity. This is what we were meant to be. This is our final evolution stage.  This is heaven. This is what it means to be happy.

1659,2020-04-21 10:12:28,g5clj6,"I've been noticing an unusual trend in the quality of Snickers bars over the last decade. I found an old one from 5 years ago and decided to study its composition under my spectrometer and discovered something unnerving. The Snickers bar currently sold in stores contains 43.67% less rare earth elements by weight, when compared to one sold 5 years ago. Do they think they can fool us? It's hard to wrap my mind around why they would do this. Thorium used to make up 12% of the bar, but now it's at 8%, and now there's only 4% Americium compared to 7% just a while ago. It's all been replaced by organic carbon-based matter, like sucrose and poorly crafted carbohydrates. I'm disappointed in the Mars corporation, and I hope my findings will gain enough publicity to force Mars into reverting back to the old formula. Consider this an open letter.

I only experienced one case where dejavu signaled me what was about to come. What I mean by signalled me is it indicated what was about to happen whilst in the dejavu moment.

Your experience with reciting all those songs are just to be amazed by it. Nothing is really going to happen. I was scared of my dejavu to mainly because no one knows shit about it. Other than theories and failed scientific studies. 

I would suggest writing your dejavu down, which was hard for me to do because of it's nature."

you're having delusions and you need to go to a doctor"

1709,2020-04-17 00:11:43,g2qhcd,why would they do that? that is a greatest hits album not a doc tracklist. plus the songs you listed aren’t his most popular

1713,2020-04-15 19:28:58,g1ybik,What kind of work ethic do these rappers have? Are they always in the zone or do they just see it as something that has to be done AKA a job?
1714,2020-04-15 19:35:54,g1ybik,"1) Do you ever get starstruck by working with these big artists?
2) What’s your favorite conversation with Kanye you remember?
3) How crazy is it to have songs you’ve worked on (like “Single Again” by Big Sean) be so popular in the public sphere after working with classical, which is not nearly as popular?"
1715,2020-04-15 19:35:43,g1ybik,"Thanks for the AMA! You have a super interesting background. What Kanye songs did you work on? Also, as a hip-hop producer, what are some resources for me to learn more about classical music and how I can incorporate it into my productions?"

Funny story - my friends and I actually ended up sitting next to someone who flew in from Canada alone just for the show, this dude named Andy. He turned out to be a dope dude and we still keep in touch on the regular. Made a lifelong friend at that show!"

1722,2020-04-15 22:52:21,g1ybik,"I have no questions, just want to say hi and that I'm a fan of your work. I've made and studied music my entire life and always favoured metal and punk and more traditional instrument based music.

Until the night I did acid and heard MBDTF for the first time. I wasn't even a fan of our Lord and saviour at the time. 
My world changed during the playing of that album and something was unlocked.

That album is like a hit of DMT or 8g dose of mushrooms. Used correctly it will change you for the better and open up new pathways through your brain. I hope someone smarter than me will figure this out"

1744,2020-04-16 02:50:26,g1ybik,Have you seen Late Orchestration? What are your thoughts on it? You think it represented anything as far as an earlier example of classical music and rap being meshed?
1745,2020-04-16 02:54:41,g1ybik,"Man I don't know if you're still answering, but I am a huge, huge Kanye fan and my favorite thing he ever did is Late Orchestration which I'm sure you're familiar with. 

What classical/orchestral music do you recommend? What orchestral hip hop do you recommend?

I'd love it if Kanye went back to that type of sound with lots of instruments and harmony. I was listening to Late Orchestration earlier, probably when you made this post, sucks that the Spotify version isn't available in the States."
1746,2020-04-16 06:01:30,g1ybik,"Do you have any software orchestral instrument plugins that you could recommend? All the popular string VSTs I run across are blown out with reverb already to get a cinematic effect, but I’m looking for something that sounds as close to the real thing as possible, allowing me to do all the processing."
1747,2020-04-15 22:04:17,g1ybik,Just had a string player record strings for me. How do you go about treating them? Do you time and tune them? Any other tips to know about?
1748,2020-04-15 19:37:59,g1ybik,"i'm not big on superlatives but a personal favorite of mine is Mahler Symphony No. 9, first movement. It goes on for like 25 minutes and it's very sad. Also Brahms Symphony No. 2 first movement. For more contemporary stuff John Adams' The Dharma At Big Sur is an electric violin concerto that slaps pretty hard"
1749,2020-04-15 19:54:33,g1ybik,"in general i've found anyone who's really successful (beyond just like one randomly viral song) works really hard. there's definitely a lot of sessions that start at 11pm or midnight and have a lot of booze and drugs present, where there's like 15 random people hanging out or partying in the room while you're trying to make a record haha. there's a lot of sessions that start like 4 hours later than scheduled and there's a lot of sessions where you show up and then everyone immediately dips to go to the club and then comes back around 2 or 3am to resume work. so it can be kinda unfocused at times but i can't think of anyone who wasn't a super hard worker through all of that. vic mensa in particular engineers all his own shit and even though it would often feel like we were doing a session in the middle of a party he was usually the most focused person there just kinda blocking it all out and working"
1750,2020-04-15 20:46:57,g1ybik,"i guess to answer the other part of this, one interaction that def shaped my life was on the phone with Kanye he said that even though they had brought me in to do strings he actually was more into these stacked vocals i was doing that sound like a choir on the Nas and Teyana records. i had barely ever done those before but after that I made it a central part of my sound. i'll reply more abt him on a couple other similar questions below. 

my goal is to make classical popular so i know there's a lot of work to be done there. i think the best signs for me that that can happen are when i see weird stuff make it really big. Single Again i'm proud of for other reasons. but when I see that a song like Runaway by kanye has hundreds of millions of streams despite starting with a minute long intro of just single piano notes, that to me shows that there's an audience for big, expansive music like classical music that does more than just deliver 3 verses and a chorus in a tight pop song format."
1751,2020-04-15 19:59:02,g1ybik,"yea it's been an interesting road. the first well-known artist i worked with was Mr. Hudson (sang Paranoid and Young Forever) and i was extremely star struck haha. Vic Mensa was a whole other level. then No I.D... Like i functioned normally but never felt totally myself around them at first. but i feel like the more credits I got and the more people I met the easier it was. when I met Big Sean a couple years later we met up at his house the first time and he's just a friendly and nice dude so I felt extremely comfortable, even though he was by far the biggest artist I had worked with that closely. I think it just came with trusting myself and understanding that ultimately I'm there bc people want my help and trust me"
1752,2020-04-15 20:17:20,g1ybik,"i mean you can obviously sample stuff but then you have to clear the sample. i personally am really into Mahler and Brahms from the old era of stuff, and for contemporary people David Lang, Steve Reich, John Adams. ppl don't realize there are still composers writing music for orchestra concerts, but for most of my life that's the only type of music I was making. I worked with Kanye when he produced the Nas and Teyana Taylor albums in 2018, as part of that cycle of 5 albums he made. I have a ton of stuff on both those albums. I also helped produce and write a song called We Got Love which he performed on Saturday Night Live and which is on the leaked version of Yandhi which never came out. it sucks cuz then he kinda moved away from that style of music (i like his new shit though) so I may have missed my window to get an actual credit on a Kanye release haha. but maybe things will come back around. I think we'll cross paths again for sure"
1753,2020-04-15 19:40:54,g1ybik,"Big Sean album, Masego album, and my own album mainly. Also just got back audio for a feature I was waiting on for a while on an upcoming single for my project so I gotta figure out how I want to fit it in and sorta re-orchestrate the music around it. I try to create unique musical moments around a feature when I get one, rather than just pasting it in on top of the beat"
1754,2020-04-15 20:05:52,g1ybik,thats insane. glad i'm making memories for ppl out here haha. when we did the shit in LA the first time there was a line around the block of a couple thousand people. i have like a time lapse video of just the line for it cuz it was so insane. i think we turned away close to 1000 people and ultimately just did our best to let people in who had flown in for it. never expected any of that
1755,2020-04-15 20:14:04,g1ybik,"i'm not gonna put any artists on blast here but def seen plenty of cocaine yea haha. usually just cuz people are working super late and that's the only way to stay focused and alert. but honestly more than anything i just see people smoking big fat blunts, pretty much constantly. i don't personally do drugs anymore although i used to do a ton haha. i actually have a song called ""I Don't Do Drugs Anymore"" which you should go listen to. but mostly I just drink now.... a lot"
1756,2020-04-15 20:08:34,g1ybik,since everyone calls him Ye now i guess you could mean fav song of his or fav song off the album Ye. for that album i'd say maybe Ghost Town. I just love 070 Shake so much. was lucky to be a part of her new album as well. I think all of her music really is carrying on the torch from like 2010-2013 era Kanye which is my fav era of his. if it's just Kanye in general I would say probably Runaway? that one feels the clearest example of the symphonic stuff that drew me to him in the first place and what i'm trying to do with my own music
1757,2020-04-15 20:01:03,g1ybik,"i think when Kanye performed We Got Love (an unreleased song on Yandhi) on Saturday Night Live and the last 40 seconds of the performance was just my orchestral outro blasting over the speakers while he and Teyana Taylor stood there solemnly, that was pretty sick haha. I had no idea it was gonna happen"
1758,2020-04-15 19:36:09,g1ybik,always down for a good manchego. or one of those big crumbly chunks of parmesan that you drizzle honey over and eat whole
1759,2020-04-15 23:15:17,g1ybik,"this is actually true? i wonder how many ppl have ""then someone played them MBDTF while they were on acid"" as their origin story beyond the two of us haha

i specifically remember just like a whole roomful of ppl in a house party listening to that minute-long intro to Runaway with the single piano notes and thinking, thats insane that something this weird can be this popular. totally reframed my thinking around what i wanna do w classical"
1760,2020-04-15 20:54:14,g1ybik,"JPEG mafia would be a big one, which I think will definitely happen within the year. since i'm also a singer (go listen to my records haha) I take a lot of inspiration from big melodic artists like Drake, the Weeknd, Post Malone, Swae Lee etc. haven't worked with any of them although I've met Post. so those would be top of my list to like, feature on or get a feature from I think. 070 Shake is prob my fav upcoming artist rn so def wanna continue working with her"
1761,2020-04-15 20:04:08,g1ybik,lol
1762,2020-04-15 21:06:07,g1ybik,"i mean it's really on my own stuff that i get to do most of what i'm proud of at the highest level. my upcoming album is my fav shit i've done. of the stuff i currently have out check out ""everybody's cool but me"" and ""fifteen"". i'm singing all the records and producing the vast majority of it as well

i def think the outro on We Got Love is one of my best things though, that was there a song that was on Yandhi (you can hear the leak somewhere), Kanye performed on SNL, and eventually came out as a Teyana Taylor song"
1763,2020-04-15 21:00:00,g1ybik,"she was super cool. as with a lot of these projects i was initially brought in there to do strings, and i did strings on like 8 songs for her. a couple of them made the project but the strings got cut, and a bunch of the songs I worked on got cut entirely from the project. this always happens. we worked on it over a year ago and at the time the sense was that the album was basically done. little did we know they would keep working on it for another year. but she's dope, it was at this studio called No Name that used to be kanye's main studio in north hollywood. she had the whole room decorated with like flags and lighting and posters and stuff even though it's normally just a sterile, professional studio vibe. so that was cool. you def felt like you were entering into her own planet when you walked in haha. she was wearing red leather pants the first day. that's most of what i remember. she had like a listening party in the middle of one of the sessions with a bunch of cool artists and creative people"
1764,2020-04-15 20:31:35,g1ybik,"it's awesome. i think it's some of his best work yet. i'm always focused on production especially and this feels like his most unified project from that standpoint. it has a more classic sound, it's not really trying to be trendy. everyone's quarantined so i've been working on stuff at home and sending it back and forth with him. i'll be working on the songs just focusing on production but as i keep looping sections i'm slowly learning the lyrics too, and the writing is incredible. he's really good at just bringing you into his life and story"
1765,2020-04-15 21:19:45,g1ybik,"in classical people study a very long time. for me that meant, lessons when i was a kid, saturday music school when i was in high school, majoring in it in college and then going to grad school for it. thats pretty standard for classical musicians. my focus during all that time was composing for classical instruments. for hip hop and pop musicians i'd say it's pretty common for people to have no schooling at all and be basically self-taught. i'm self-taught on piano and self-taught in producing (never took a single class on producing) so i'm more close to the norm there. i think where i have unusual skills in this industry is that i can write sheet music out and can voice chords and stuff better than most ppl cuz I just have a really strong background in those aspects of music"
1766,2020-04-15 21:03:35,g1ybik,"its weird cuz my way into rap was from classical music and through cool production sounds, so my favorite artists in rap are gonna be the ones whose production i like the most. for that it's gonna be Travis Scott for sure, Don Toliver, that whole crew. if you count singers i'd say like 070 Shake, Saint JHN, Roy Woods, Tyla Yaweh, Tierra Whack. but yea i'm not listening to rap as much for incredible lyricism (although i obviously appreciate that shit) so I'm prob not the person to weigh in on that aspect. i'm looking at it more as a composer"
1767,2020-04-16 00:44:55,g1ybik,"theres lots of different things that can make something great. like a great Justin Bieber song has to do very different things from a great Travis Scott song, let alone a great piece of classical orchestra music. there are really elegant simple pop songs that are impossibly hard to write...

but for me personally, the reason i'm drawn to the music i'm drawn to in hip hop is that it gets the widest possible range of stuff to fit together in one song or album. this is why Yeezus was the focus of that yeethoven show initially. there's no other artist who could fit some of the wide-ranging musical elements that he crams into the songs on there. like the outro of New Slaves vs the rest of the song. or the fact that he has 90s industrial rock elements on the same album as old soul samples, reggae vocals, rapping, mike dean guitar solos and trap trombones and it all feels like one coherent world is the most impressive thing to me. some ppl prefer Pablo cuz it arguably has more bangers on it, but I much prefer Yeezus cuz as a musical journey it feels coherent and finished, yet completely insane.  i think that large-scale juxtaposition of contrasting elements is a much more symphonic way of thinking than you usually see on pop and hip hop albums, and thinking about how to make those contrasts as extreme as possible while still working"
1768,2020-04-15 20:11:53,g1ybik,basically my life goal is to change classical music and make it important again in mainstream american culture. and just make it awesome haha. so i was already focused on that for a while and for the most part I just ignored pop and hip hop music. i got into Kanye cuz of MBDTF which really felt like the missing link between what I was doing and the millions of people i wanted to reach. when i first heard that album i spend like a year or two listening to it while just continuing to do classical. by the time i finished school i had decided i needed to go into that world. so i basically jsut bought a copy of Logic overnight and started listening to more current hip hop and stuff and just trying to get good at producing and singing
1769,2020-04-15 20:52:16,g1ybik,"the stuff i've learned from No I.D. could fill a book haha, pretty much everything that dude speaks is wisdom. that's why Sean and other ppl call him Yoda sometimes. 

from Kanye i would say the main thing I learend from him was this: he had brought me in to do string arrangements initially and most producers who bring me in for that want the strings to kinda help the chorus of the song build. but Kanye wanted the opposite, he didn't want the strings to be ON TOP of other shit, fighting with the chorus vocals for your attention. he said leave the choruses alone and instead put the strings in their own section when nothing else is happening, including vocals. so like the bridge of the song, instead of having a vocal part goes to just strings. this has completely changed how i make my own music (which you should go listen to!) cuz i'm always trying to fit orchestra sounds into my records. 

the big takeaway was, people are only going to pay attention to ONE thing at a time. if strings are important to the record, put them in a section with nothing else happening, like an outro or intro, or bridge. don't put them on top of the other stuff or ppl will miss it. and this applies to lots of things. you can hear it all over the Teyana Taylor album we did, and you can hear it on We Got Love which was unreleased on the Yandhi leak. and you can hear it all over his own music especially on albums like Yeezus. if he wants to do something crazy he doesn't do it at the same time as other shit, he gives it its own section where nothing else is happening"
1770,2020-04-15 21:47:52,g1ybik,were you also eating beans
1771,2020-04-15 21:54:29,g1ybik,"so that one I never even came to the studio for. Mike Dean just randomly facetimed me and was like ""do you do cello"" and i knew a cellist who lived near me and i knew how to write for it. initially he just sent me the beat loop and told me to do what i wanted. that was cool but then he realized he wanted something pretty specific based off travis's vocals, so he tried like, singing it to me over the phone and i just didnt think that was gonna be clear enough for me to get what he wanted. but he didnt wanna send the actual song cuz ppl are hacking his email all the time trying to leak Travis songs, so i convinced him to send me the song with insane distortion on it so it's basically unlistenable but you can still kinda make out the travis vocal melodies. then i transcribed those and recorded them in my living room with a cellist. he said he wanted Blame Game type stuff and that's in octaves so I did a low and a high octave and sent the stems. didn't hear anything more til it came out haha. can see more about it here [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAdxX73CuJo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAdxX73CuJo)"

1773,2020-04-16 08:28:32,g1ybik,"damn this took forever to show up for me for some reason haha. i kept looking for it. what up! 

100% the artist shit for me. thats always been the goal. i just want this platform where i can do the crazy opera and symphonic shit i wanna do and i think that requires having a massive fanbase who will buy the tickets. theres a reason Kanye can put on an opera if he wants to these days. but i got into producing too bc i like collaborating and i figure, hey maybe i can go on tour w some of these ppl eventually, or feature them on my records etc. i'm always down to build w other ppl"
1774,2020-04-15 20:57:02,g1ybik,"i don't personally use any synths or guitars in my own songs, i only use orchestral instruments plus 808s and drums. for orchestral instruments i have bass clarinet and cello on everything, especially my upcoming album. bass clarinet is an insane instrument haha. when i'm in the studio with big artists they usually have a lot of synths though and I really like the juno, the moog bass and i like certain sounds on the mellotron"
1775,2020-04-15 21:38:49,g1ybik,nah but i love her music
1776,2020-04-15 21:48:09,g1ybik,like composing them or performing them?
1777,2020-04-15 21:50:06,g1ybik,"piano since second grade (Self taught but took some lessons around like 4th grade i think, i hated them and quit, went back to learning on my own).

classical composition lessons since maybe 7th grade? once a week, then college and grad school so many years haha. i guess that was like about 10 years of study

and then producing since 2013"
1778,2020-04-15 23:11:52,g1ybik,"they're cool! i know the ppl at audiomack well, i also know the guy who does those arrangements and my friend plays violin in them. i've only seen a few but i think they do a great job. if i was doing something like that i think my preference would be to try to make it work with full orchestra or at least just only have classical instruments cuz once you have drums in there you basically cant hear the classical elements anymore anyway. but then of course it doesnt slap as hard so its a tricky balance. this is a bit different but i've been doing chamber music arrangements of my own records in the studio and releasing them as videos, and for these i really dont use any drums or anything, its just strings and vocals. again its a more chill feel and you're not gonna dance to it but ppl seem to respond really well when the focus is on that strings lushness [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_WrCnJOmrWA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WrCnJOmrWA)"
1779,2020-04-16 08:25:09,g1ybik,"haha i've seen those memes. but honestly, having spent a decent amount of time around that dude, i think he's just an extremely genuine heartfelt person. sometimes shit that seems corny to ppl is actually just the result of someone being completely true and not trying to hide behind ""trying to be cool"" or whatever. i would just take those types of bars as evidence that this guy isn't trying to be anything he's not. i think you'll like the new album compared to everything else he's done, it's really good"
1780,2020-04-16 08:09:27,g1ybik,yep thats the only thing i use actually. and for instrumental scores and sheet music and classical shit i use Sibelius
1781,2020-04-16 08:11:20,g1ybik,"yea theres been a bunch of things like this over the years, thats not the only one, but it's maybe the best one. but ultimately i wanna see stuff where the orchestra is being used not just to replace the backing track on a song but as the central part of the composition the way it is in classical. i have a ton of ideas for how this could happen which hopefully i can bring to life in the next couple years"
1782,2020-04-16 08:17:29,g1ybik,"haha well obviously i'll send you to my own stuff first, just check me on spotify etc. i'm trying to merge the orchestral world with the production and vocals i've kinda learned from the weeknd and post malone, james blake and other artists like that. 

kanye's always gonna keep changing it up but i think if you're into 2010-2013 era epic/dark/orchestral kanye a good place to get that now is from 070 shake's records. she's so dope. 

for pure classical i think i responded somewhere else abt this but some favorites from older eras of mine are Mahler 9th symphony, Brahms second symphony. some more contemporary classical stuff i love is anything by steve reich, david lang, john adams"
1783,2020-04-16 08:21:43,g1ybik,"i'm like so sparing w this shit. i use a ton of default logic plugins for compression EQ distortion etc. and i've just gotten really good at making them work. for orchestra sounds i categorically refuse to use software sounds, i will only use live instruments for it. a lot of ppl say Spitfire is good but i just don't use sample libraries at all. orchestra stuff is the main thing i do for ppl so i feel like i can afford to be picky with it. but see how spitfire is, i think there are a couple others that ppl recommend. or... find a friend who can play violin or flute or cello or whatever you need and try to get good at working with live musicians for this shit. the results will be way more personal and just better imo"
1784,2020-04-16 01:22:16,g1ybik,"you've already recorded but here's what i would do: 3 takes of each part, tell them to play quieter than they think ""like they're in a section, not a soloist"", pan the takes left middle right, any melodies get both low and high octaves. add little bit of compression, little EQ dip around 4k-5k if its violins usually, plus normal EQ shit obviously, maybe a little saturation to fuzzy up the high end, lot of reverb. i try to get good players who i dont have to tune and time but theres always something. rhythmic parts usually a little rushed, high notes sometimes a little out of tune. i manually fix that stuff if necessary, as little as possible. i don't use autotune on strings"
1785,2020-04-15 19:39:26,g1ybik,"working with Kanye was very intense cuz I just wanted to deliver and not fuck it up haha. we met in a studio in Burbank briefly through Mike Dean after they had just gotten back from Wyoming and then I dealt with him mostly on the phone after that, sending stuff back and forth with Mike and occasionally hearing from Kanye that he wanted this or that"

1790,2020-04-15 21:07:07,g1ybik,"do you think classical music can be mainstream accessible without most people having an academic understanding of it?

like one needs essentially no context to be able to appreciate the “look atcha” sample kanye uses on runaway (or really the majority of his production) but something like the second movement (that’s the correct term?) of bach’s symphony no. 1 I don’t at all find sonically pleasing nor do I know enough music theory to know why it’s compelling, and so I’m just bored by it

I guess a second question could be: do you think all people could appreciate all “classical” music? or are there some symphonies that will just never click with some people 

I would like to think I have an appreciation of more abstract and longer-form music, and certainly no taste for pop or pop-adjacent genres but I think a lot of “classical” work just goes over my head"

Also, how did you initially get your foot in the door of the hip-hop world after that project?"

But I remember hearing with perfect clarity the striking of every note on that album, every time change, every layer of every sample and every lyric and how my brain reacted to it and I still get shivers today when I think about it. I can put the album on now and just enjoy it, but if I go back in my head to that first time it is literally burned into my psyche. 

I truly believe it's more than a collection of songs. Whether that was the intent or if it was just a perfect coincidence, I don't think we could know. 

I've never told anyone this before and to know it happened to you too is some form of confirmation."

1815,2020-04-15 23:55:28,g1ybik,"Damn, I actually really liked this. Reuniting hip-hop performing artists back together with the samples and instruments that accompany them is a niche I wish was further explored. It would be so cool if you could continue doing work like this. 

I don't know if you've heard of it, but the subgenres of Brooklyn and London drill are often based in classical music samples. E.g. [No Suburban](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXWNvHWhtIo), [Hazards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hojXQcOVzg), [Kennington Where It Started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ed-oXKDmca0), etc. I feel like that's an untapped market right there, working with Pressplay, GRM Daily, or Mixtape Madness or something. It would also be somewhat of a political statement because drill is very censored in the UK (many artists have been banned from using certain words in their lyrics and/or shooting music videos), and often called ""not real music"" by older crowds, so putting them in front of classical musicians would honestly give the subgenre a little more legitimacy, I feel. Idk though I'm just a random redditor lol"

1821,2020-04-15 21:13:09,g1ybik,I’m Vic’s engineer. He does a lot of his own stuff. He is technically very sound. He doesn’t really mix but he will comp his own vocals and he sets up his own sessions with a little help from me. He’s currently in Chicago and I’m in LA and we work thru FaceTime sessions.
1822,2020-04-15 21:17:15,g1ybik,"like engineers his own vocals. just recording himself and comping as he goes. and he produces a bit too. he's mad good at pro tools. most artists have an engineer do that, but he just pushes them aside and does it himself haha"
1823,2020-04-15 21:16:10,g1ybik,"these are awesome questions which i think about constantly. i'm not saying that all people are gonna be into some random symphony from 1880 or whatever, although maybe some could be. i'm more saying that like, the people who are currently writing classical music and presenting classical music events need to aggressively update all of that shit so it provides for today's audiences what classical orchestra music provided originally, which is basically a transcendent or spectacular mindfuck experience. closer to Cirque du Soleil than the current classical format. closer to kanye's recent ""operas"" than to classical opera, or maybe somewhere in the middle. i've been working on ideas for this my whole life but decided I needed a bigger platform to really do it, hence me tryna be a pop star now haha"
1824,2020-04-16 11:50:44,g1ybik,">	but I think a lot of “classical” work just goes over my head

Honestly? It could be that, or it could just not be up your alley. You don’t need to have a highly academic background to enjoy classical music, if you listen to it and enjoy it (or just don’t get bored), maybe eventually get the whole “oh this part sounds happy and this sounds sad”, then really ain’t that good enough?"
1825,2020-04-15 20:37:57,g1ybik,"it was pretty brief and chaotic cuz as you know it was ""an album a week for 5 weeks"". i don't think i've ever seen ppl as exhausted as i saw Mike Dean who was really holding it all down. so there wasn't a lot of hanging out but when Mike brought me in to meet Kanye the first time he was like ""its johan the yeethoven guy"" haha. so he def knows about it. if i ever get a chance to really sit down with him i def wanna break down the whole show for him. in general though i would say he just was very clear about what he wanted, and sorta like softspoken and a little awkward if anything? like shy basically. it sounds counterintuitive but yea. 

when I did Yeethoven I had already been out in LA producing and writing for a couple years and gotten to know Mr. Hudson pretty well through a music publisher who introduced us. so I wasn't just totally a rando. from there, a friend who Hudson brought to Yeethoven introduced me to Vic Mensa's co-manager Dave Appleton and Scooter Braun, and through them I met Vic and got hired to do strings on his album Autobiography. through Vic I met No I.D. , through No I.D. i met big sean and snoh aalegra, alessia cara etc. All of this took a couple years though. Unrelated to all of that, Mike Dean had followed me on twitter after the first yeethoven and I hadn't even noticed haha. When we did Yeethoven II i hit him up to get him tickets. He couldn't go but he had heard about me from Vic too so he thought I was legit enough based off that, so he brought me into the studio with him the next week to work with Desiigner. That went well so he brought me in with Kanye a couple months later. And finally he put me on astroworld later that year."
1826,2020-04-16 08:44:46,g1ybik,"yep and i got my writer credit on that for sure, mike dean was very good abt that"

i'm trying to get a few of the bigger artists i've worked on to make appearances on the album, we'll see how that goes..."
1830,2020-04-15 21:10:19,g1ybik,"would love to. got some other big orchestra plans around some other artists i like coming up as well, once we get out of quarantine haha"
1831,2020-04-15 21:09:55,g1ybik,oh crap you're right
1832,2020-04-15 21:13:02,g1ybik,"to me the first 3 Kanye albums are all incredible and i listen to them a ton, but coming from classical, I was always more interested in music that plays with form and juxtaposes extreme contrasting elements. you don't really start to see this stuff until 808s and even more so on the next 3 albums. the first Yeethoven show focused entirely on Yeezus, cuz thats the album that we felt had the most extreme compositional choices which felt similar to what we love in classical. those productions feel closer to ""compositions"" than to standard hip hop / pop songs. Late Registration is incredible but in that era he was still mostly locked into fairly standard song structures. same with Graduation. it's not a criticism at all, just a different focus depending on what you're trying to get out of it"
1833,2020-04-16 08:46:49,g1ybik,"yea the mike dean style outro is like an entire thing in itself now. it's a really good way to open up the song further at the end, like it can be a banger thats mostly just about being fun the whole way through, and then you hit that outro and its like ""oh shit this was actually way more serious than i thought"". it works well on a ton of kanye and travis records and i've def taken inspiration from that"
1834,2020-04-15 21:21:24,g1ybik,"yessir. i should make a video showing how i did it. if you like that check out my own music, pretty much of all of it sounds like that outro haha, cuz when im in charge no one stops me from just putting orchestra stuff all over every part of the song"

1836,2020-04-15 23:29:18,g1ybik,"yea thats insane. sometimes when i hang w No I.D. he starts telling stories about how they made it, and it's funny cuz I'm almost always very chill about the fact that most of this stuff isnt magic, none of these ppl are gods, etc. and down to hear how the shit got made, but for that one album I kinda don't wanna know too much haha, like its impact on me was so big and I always viewed it as perfect so i'm less interested in knowing how some of the songs were cobbled together from random scraps of other shit etc"
1837,2020-04-16 08:51:32,g1ybik,"it's honestly all fucking amazing. astroworld feels like the culmination but all that shit has been building in his music for a long time. i def love Stargazing if i had to shout a particular song out

i've taken heavy inspiration from his production when working on my own music and on my upcoming album"
1838,2020-04-15 23:12:19,g1ybik,good call ima do that
1839,2020-04-16 08:49:43,g1ybik,"no one asked about the Nas album but if you go listen to Nasir, that first song has an orchestra and choir sample. the entire choir is just me singing in my garage and the entire orchestra is one violinist stacked a million times, also in my garage, and some Logic stock percussion sounds, and the entire thing was made by me between 11pm and 2am, 2 nights before the album was released. the shit you have to do sometimes to get these placements is insane haha. especially when kanye is trying to produce ""5 albums in 5 weeks"" so no one is sleeping"
1840,2020-04-15 21:20:03,g1ybik,its incredible. also baritone sax
1841,2020-04-15 23:24:32,g1ybik,"damn its hard. i think knowing how to read music is pretty critical. but i also kinda learned it from the process of composing. i use this software Sibelius which just makes it faster to write sheet music. it doesnt do it for you, but it comes out looking nicer and cleaner. the audio playback sounds like ass but thats not the point, the point is to like, print out sheet music and then hand that to classical musicians. i guess i'd try to find someone you know who plays a classical instrument and try to start writing for them, cuz they can help you a lot by telling you what works or doesnt work on the instrument and help you get your sheet music easier to read and understand for performers. but yea theres no easy answer haha. all of that took years. you just gotta decide you wanna do it and, like anything else, try to place yourself around ppl who are currently in that world so you can learn from them and feed off each others energy"
1842,2020-04-15 23:21:25,g1ybik,"idk about quickly but i learned by just trying, through trial and error, to play the shit i heard that i liked. any song i wanted to play. just hitting notes until it started to sound right. it took years haha. luckily i was a child so i had nothing better to do. it's slow but if you just set small goals for yourself, like figure out the melody to some really simple pop song in C major without playing any chords, and just do 30 min a day on that type of thing i think after a while you would start to get way better. just having that one-to-one correlation between what you hear and what notes on the piano it is has pretty much enabled me to do everything that i do"
1843,2020-04-16 01:18:54,g1ybik,"yea i always enjoy pissing ppl off w that exact type of shit. i think a lot of the ""highbrow"" laurels that classical musicians rest on are pretty baseless so its nice being able to come from that background and have that credibility but be able to introduce them to other provocative forms of music"
1844,2020-04-15 20:01:36,g1ybik,"thats right haha. pretty much exactly how i felt, and still feel"
1845,2020-04-16 02:06:08,g1ybik,Have you seen the Audiomack Trap Symphony videos where they take a rap/trap song and remake the instrumental with classical instrument. The [A Boogie ](https://youtu.be/gxt8luAY63s) ones are the best but Roddy Rich’s are dope too. Think it works rather well with any melodic shit with simple chords to mirror.
1846,2020-04-15 21:24:59,g1ybik,"what up man, yea this is Wil, he was absolutely the Mike Dean in this scenario holding that shit down and keeping the overall sessions organized and mixing everything and making sure an album happened and existed.... i think vocals are just very personal for artists sometimes so its annoying both for you and for the engineer if youre constantly yelling at them about where to punch your vocal take etc, especially for long verses. easier to just do it yourself if you can learn those skills"

If you're ever planning on touring Yeethoven again, please come to DC. Cheers and congrats on how far you've made it"
1856,2020-04-15 23:44:49,g1ybik,"Exactly. Dude. Whoa whoa yes. Even the gods quote just then.... That's something I've actually even said before. 

I feel like Hip hop is a different thing to what we call a genre of music. It's not like any other in that it's extremely reactive to its environment. Hundreds of different versions of the same song exist in the form of remixes and you can basically tailor it to suit you in a moment. You can't do that with Beethoven, Slipknot or Metallica. They exist for themselves. 

Hip hop still retains the DIY aestheticc that Punk invented but modernized it to work with today's tech and you can hear it evolve because it's alive and just like a psychedelic it can alter your brain.

yea a lot of ppl obviously say that abt Vic, and he has done a lot of dif stuff. all i can say is he definitely believes in everything he does, and if it seems like he hits a wide range of genres in his music thats just because he genuinely loves a wide range of music. he works super hard and his upcoming shit i think will really appeal to you...."

1869,2020-04-16 08:33:59,g1ybik,How’s the process of determine who gets what credit go? Whose final decision is that on an album with so many hands on it?
1870,2020-04-16 08:44:28,g1ybik,"really different depending on the artist and the genre. i worked on that Nas album with kanye and the deal for that only got finalized like 6 weeks ago. so that was close to 2 years after the shit came out haha. my manager just chases it and hassles ppl forever until it's sorted out. the good thing about being in LA and just like IN the music industry is that everyone knows each other and people generally don't wanna fuck up a relationship so they'll try to get the deal sorted out in a way that makes everyone happy. 

i think i also just have a lot more leverage now than i did then, and we've established with a bunch of big artists that when i record and produce strings it counts as producing, even though maybe 30 years ago it would've been just hired session musician work. theres this dude Roget who i'm friends with who made the chords on Sicko Mode. he's done a great job of really demanding that he be called a producer for stuff that in other situations might just be like, hired keyboard player or maybe songwriter. he's built a really strong brand that way. he's a couple years ahead of me i'd say but def learned a lot from him. it's def easier to fight for producer cred now when I can point to a bunch of big artists who gave me producer credit for doing what i do. and the more i release my own music and build my brand, the more that helps as well to just be like, this is my sound, if you want my sound this is what the deal has to look like"
1871,2020-04-16 10:59:10,g1ybik,Thats funny bro because Roget's brother I think posted a video here of him playing the organ(?) Doing the sicko mode chords at home. It's a small world.

1982,2020-04-13 03:32:27,fzymyd,"They raise some good points but meander *way* off track before getting back to their point. Lil Nas X and Orville incorporating the cowboy aesthetic and making it their own is a definite counterculture move. Considering the mythology and stereotypes surrounding the cowboy and the stereotypes about being gay, both are definitely at odds with each other.

But I'm not convinced that the cowboy itself is a counterculture icon in these trying times. I think the lone cowboy archetype has always been around, even if pop culture stopped producing Westerns. Especially in America, the idea of a lone cowboy striking out on their own has always prevailed as some idealised myth, irrespective of any ongoing financial crises. I'm also not convinced that just 2 artistes constitutes a trend either. I definitely buy the idea that LNX and Orville have taken on and are challenging the macho manly man cowboy archetype, but I'm not convinced they are making a statement about reviving the lone cowboy culture in response to the ongoing financial turmoil."

Considering that the general public’s concept of cowboys and the western has been constructed heavily by cinema and especially Hollywood, it arguably has a lot to do with movies.

1990,2020-04-13 10:54:21,fzylob,"So, Mulvey‘s essay only looked at a very specific, and early, time in Hollywood cinema, when a truly male gaze really pushed itself onto the viewer. The Sternberg films with Marlene Dietrich are a focus. Now, in current discourse, the Male Gaze gets used a bit too often and in most cases differently from Mulvey: the mere act of men observing women in film. Originally, the Male Gaze captures the objectifying that women in 30s cinema were subjected to. Specifically, women can only be either a passive object of male desire or a fetishized version of something (Dietrich being masculine is dangerous for the male, so her entire appearance is a fetishized version of a male). In later Cinema, this notion loses the grip it can display brilliantly in early cinema. That is why I don’t see much of a point in obsessing over it. However, I think it can still be adapted and reconfigured for contemporary purposes, but this must be done with the needed reflection. Especially fitting would have been that Lil Nas X is literally wearing a fetish-cowboy costume, which in a weird twist overloads the image of the gay cowboy with so much sexuality that it eradicated everything *but* the homo-erotic, which is so dangerous to the male gaze."
1991,2020-04-12 18:46:08,fzylob,"I really liked the different angles you analyzed the idea of the cowboy as a modern countercultural icon through comparison to film, other music, politics, and cultural phenomena like the rise of incel culture. Great read!"
1992,2020-04-12 22:14:37,fzylob,">America is the endgame of the brutal imperialism, colonialism, and even outright genocide of Western civilization.  

That's right."
1993,2020-04-13 17:44:22,fzylob,"Whoa, this is (edit: coincidentally!) what I'm writing my final paper on in my queer theory class! I love how you approached this and referenced film. Great read!"
1994,2020-04-12 16:25:40,fzylob,Slow clap for this one mate
1995,2020-04-13 01:05:27,fzylob,"Interesting read. Since you mentioned HBO, I’m wondering how an analysis of West World might fit into this? Do this new conception of the cow boy apply to the western figures in the show or does it subvert that, instead returning to a more traditional sense of the archetype?"
1996,2020-04-13 09:58:36,fzylob,"Hey You should cross post this to r/wildwest, an active sub with Western authors, podcasters, etc; I’m curious what they’d think about your resurgent cowboy idea"

1998,2020-04-12 19:03:12,fzylob,"Reading the article, but I just got Orville Peck's album. This is the first I've checked out his work! SubPop is the best.

Thank you for pointing me that way, unintentional though it was!"
1999,2020-04-12 17:47:51,fzylob,You can even possibly see it in Mac Demarco’s last album.
2000,2020-04-12 22:13:42,fzylob,Good article
2001,2020-05-06 17:03:02,fzylob,"Great observations. Furthermore the trend has spread beyond USA. Recently HMLTD put out a fairy well received album titled “West of Eden” with heavy western influences. The kicker is that this band is a British glam/experimental rock group.

Not to mention the band uses the cowboy symbol with the same gender bending twist."
2002,2020-04-14 11:05:07,fzylob,"Thanks for the suggestion, I’ll definitely check that out. One of the things I feel that is missing from this analysis is female voices, so that would be something to try and add on later.

Thanks again for reading!"
2003,2020-04-13 03:29:56,fzylob,I came here to say this.

2005,2020-06-10 13:32:48,fzylob,"Thanks! Sounds like an interesting subject! A lot of my friends’ semesters where upended by the pandemic, so I hope yours went well!"
2006,2020-04-12 15:43:20,fzykcr,"This is a long-winded puff piece about 2 very
Irrelevant music “artists”. Because Lil Nas X won a Grammy doesn’t mean he’s talented, nor does it mean he’s a music icon. This is the equivalent of writing an article on Kid Rock, but maybe even worse. I stopped reading when you started talking about The history of the Cowboy, who are you kidding?"
2007,2020-05-03 15:08:58,gcs264,It’s not that deep.
2008,2020-05-03 15:22:58,gcs264,First of all I disagree. Almost everyone knows the difference between nas and lil nas x. Second of all. No one should listen to your music tastes. I’ve argued with you before and you think mgk and pewdiepie are better than Kanye and Kendrick. Someone’s scared of black people. You also say the n word hard r. So fuck youuuuuu

2010,2020-05-03 15:55:19,gcs264,"Nas is probably unbothered by Lil Nas X’s name or views it as a compliment. Also, no one under 23 or 24 is big on Nas like that. I only know him because of the fiasco with Kelis."
2011,2020-05-03 15:14:32,gcs264,Sup im new to the rap game and I go by lil 2pac.
2012,2020-05-03 15:38:03,gcs264,"I disagree. I'm a huge nas fan and dont give a damn about lil nas x. But they pull completely different fanbases and are completely different people. Lil nas x doesnt bite off nas, hes a lil flamboyant singer from 2018. Nas was a g from New York who's a hip hop icon. They arent even close to similar and I dont think most lil nas x fans give a damn about nas."

i really do want to say that none of these artists are even really that related. dababy and lil baby have quite a few differences, and so does drake. sure they all have similarities, but comon

this leads me to believe that you actually have no taste or knowledge of music, despite the fact you think liking death grips somehow makes you a cooler person than your peers

2138,2020-04-29 06:06:44,ga3q2k,"It's good and all, but you forgot ""Slumped Whip (ft. Lil Wayne)"""
2139,2020-04-29 05:44:05,ga3q2k,Kill my vibe without the feature would be great
2140,2020-04-29 10:29:14,ga3q2k,"I agree, once completely finished and perfected by him, definitely. His talent was only improving, he would have soon been using his own beats and shit. Skins had potential too, but it was way too short to compete with ""?""."
2141,2020-04-29 17:54:18,ga3q2k,"Bruh how are you not gonna put BVF the single on BVF the album lol plus the was prob my favorite song off the album, such a vibe"
2142,2020-04-29 05:58:03,ga3q2k,bruh you say you want all demos tracks off the album but then you want gekyume on the track lol
2143,2020-04-29 08:26:07,ga3q2k,kill my vibe is a masterpiece and nothing can change my mind
2144,2020-04-29 11:32:32,ga3q2k,Lmfao you out gekyume freestyle on it? That song is ass it’s basically a voice memo
2145,2020-04-29 15:27:17,ga3q2k,"I agree, bad vibes forever could've been alot better if they put a bit more effort into it"
2146,2020-04-29 05:42:57,ga3q2k,i feel like im the only one who honestly loves kill my vibe
2147,2020-04-29 06:15:29,ga3q2k,"Damnit why do I like ""Kill My Vibe"" so much compared to everyone else? It almost makes me feel like I'm missing something."
2148,2020-04-29 13:38:08,ga3q2k,For real... they really fucked everything with the album. There was too much songs and songs were put like they were forced to do that. Your tracklist is perfect at 100%
2149,2020-04-29 22:13:39,ga3q2k,thinking about how they massacred bvf makes me sad
2150,2020-04-30 03:41:29,ga3q2k,flashing the badge officer
2151,2020-04-29 11:44:14,ga3q2k,Idk about gekyume freestyle 😬
2152,2020-04-29 20:15:23,ga3q2k,"Imo bvf shouldn’t have been a thing. They should’ve had Skins the same way it was left, and then release a Skins Deluxe with all the finished tracks that were instead put on Bvf. All demos that they put a feature on should’ve been given to the featured person to release on there own"
2153,2020-04-29 06:08:57,ga3q2k,oh damn vro.. u right.
2154,2020-04-29 05:49:12,ga3q2k,you guys hate everything that’s even slightly different lol
2155,2020-04-29 13:45:35,ga3q2k,"I know ima get hated on but skins is my favorite X album, ? Being second"
2156,2020-04-29 06:05:41,ga3q2k,"Gekyume is a demo yes but it can be arranged to be a finished track, it has two verses and a chorus, if it was mastered and had a better structure and they cut out any mistakes X made while recording it could've easily been released."
2157,2020-04-29 11:44:28,ga3q2k,Facts
2158,2020-04-29 13:36:50,ga3q2k,He recorded a song for Gekyume he was probably talking about this one
2159,2020-04-29 09:33:18,ga3q2k,yeah it actually has great energy. if x sang a verse it could be sad part 2.
2160,2020-04-29 07:10:30,ga3q2k,People have their opinions. I love kill my vibe as a whole but I could do without Tom g
2161,2020-04-29 06:18:23,ga3q2k,"why do you have such a problem with us not liking the guys voice ? it’s not like we’re hating on him for not being someone like Julie WRLD or ski mask, we sincerely don’t like how his voice sounds"
2162,2020-04-29 06:21:01,ga3q2k,"tbh I don't even like X's part on KMV, I think the beat is aight but that's about it, Tom. G's voice is insufferably bad and his flow is kinda wack. I am ALL for hoarse voices, I listen to shit like that all the time, but there's something about his voice in particular that is just flat-out off-putting"
2163,2020-04-29 05:50:46,ga3q2k,"It’s not that I don’t like his verse it’s that I couldn’t get past his voice. His verse was excellent and I’ve never had problems with voices in the past (Kendrick, kodak, etc) but for some reason I just couldn’t deal with it"
2164,2020-04-29 22:02:46,ga3q2k,"Skins is fye af tho, don't get it fucked up. I'd only say ""?"", because of the versatility and quantity of songs. The album cover is iconic af too"
2165,2020-04-29 13:46:30,ga3q2k,"How come it hasn’t leaked if it exists, I’m pretty sure it’s just the freestyle that the team were talking about."
2166,2020-04-29 06:24:08,ga3q2k,"because its just a continuing pattern of anything that's even slightly different or weird or out of the norm being controversial on this sub

his voice is just gravelly"
2167,2020-04-29 06:34:45,ga3q2k,"Opinions (especially musical ones) are incredibly subjective and unique to every single person. If you don't like someone else's opinion you shouldn't feel obligated to force yours down anyone else's throats like you do. I personally love Scarlxrd, but I don't shit on you for not liking him (though I don't understand the whole ""biting"" thing you always say) nor do I try and force you to like it. Don't try and shit on everyone on the sub for not liking the same things you do or trying to force them to like it."
2168,2020-04-29 06:28:16,ga3q2k,"exactly, and most of us don’t like it. if we don’t like it we don’t like it just like you don’t links ski mask becuase you don’t like ski mask. I shouldn’t feel forced to listen to someone’s voice if I can’t stand it"
2169,2020-04-29 06:44:38,ga3q2k,"glad u stated it, agree 100%"
2170,2020-04-29 00:13:25,g9yydh,!!!
2171,2020-04-29 03:16:58,g9yv45,IXFP
2172,2020-04-29 13:07:32,g9yv45,"That's definitely a possibility. I'm self-typed as ISFP right now, just having some doubts I guess. Just curious though, what makes you say IXFP?"
2173,2020-04-29 20:52:20,g9yv45,"Upon first glance, the songs scream out introverted to me. Secondly, INFP comes to mind, because of the introverted feeling vibes, and that I know many INFPs and very few ISFPs. Maybe if there were more “weird” or philosophical songs, I’d pull the trigger on INFP. But so far, I’m just getting introverted feeling dominant. Hope this answers your question!"
2174,2020-04-28 23:31:06,g9xdxe,can't wait for school globes to drop
2175,2020-04-28 22:46:21,g9xdxe,Damn you beat me to it

2177,2020-04-29 04:23:57,g9xdxe,I’m actually hyped for school globes and I was a fan since it first leaked
2178,2020-04-29 05:16:45,g9xdxe,This shit makes me so happy

I don’t know if X did beat Geneva, so what? It happened. Plus I believe they always fought each other. Whatever *some* of you see one thing and assume. Smh"

2202,2020-04-29 17:50:42,g9xdxe,I mean people are allowed to have an opinion? If he thinks Iggy is better than X he’s allowed to think that and still like X...
2203,2020-04-29 01:46:24,g9xdxe,He’s only listening to an X song how tf does it mean anything
2204,2020-04-29 00:21:58,g9xdxe,The guy who made old town road and panini

2210,2020-04-28 23:36:24,g9xdxe,man what? lil nas didn’t do anything to clout chase so why you bringing up other times x was used for clout chasing
2211,2020-04-29 10:22:00,g9xdxe,"It's more for respect and shit with me. I only listen if it's never officially getting dropped or if there are thousands on thousands, like Juice"
2212,2020-04-29 02:23:08,g9xdxe,Doesn't mean much but we are getting School Globes one day though.
2213,2020-04-29 00:23:00,g9xdxe,The song that goes “I got horses in the back”. It was number 1 on billboard charts for months

2243,2020-04-28 06:25:21,g9hxyq,Never heard of him but would be interesting to hear
2244,2020-04-28 06:25:43,g9hxyq,I dont think they would due to his songs. It would involve a lot of bleeping
2245,2020-04-28 06:44:14,g9hxyq,"Ski would be dope, especially since he is (was?) a big fortnite fan. He probably isn't big enough to get Epic's attention, though."
2246,2020-04-28 06:30:57,g9hxyq,Joyner Lucas would amazing honestly
2247,2020-04-28 06:35:03,g9hxyq,A guitarist would be nice to see. It would add some nice emotes

2253,2020-04-28 06:33:00,g9hxyq,Was wrong with lil nas?
2254,2020-04-28 06:29:40,g9hxyq,"He is part of Linkin Park, he's a very talented musician singer/song writer.

He has some solo work, and collabs."
2255,2020-04-28 06:26:01,g9hxyq,I mean I would not say he swears much more than Travis does in his songs.  Most of his “hits” don’t have much swearing
2256,2020-04-28 09:47:18,g9hxyq,They will just bleep it out like Travis Scott
2257,2020-04-28 06:27:00,g9hxyq,it’s called epic “ bring back cute progressive skins because we only get two recooked and we need more because i wanna be different “ it’s on Spotify
2258,2020-04-28 06:30:24,g9hxyq,Ah. Ive heard of linkin park. I may give him a listen
2259,2020-04-28 06:31:38,g9hxyq,Hm. Maybe they could pull it off.
2260,2020-04-28 06:32:30,g9hxyq,That is my favorite song
2261,2020-04-28 06:41:03,g9hxyq,"omg wow, if it hit one more stream i would have gave you 100,00vbucks im totally not lying :)"

2267,2020-04-26 04:03:46,g86j81,"but he's literally not a one hit wonder, he had a second hit"
2268,2020-04-26 02:49:26,g86j81,Y'all goofy if you ever bumped him
2269,2020-04-26 04:21:23,g86j81,Why do you care
2270,2020-04-26 03:12:25,g86j81,"It’s lil nas, who the fuck actually cares man fuck this guy for real"
2271,2020-04-26 02:43:16,g86j81,Still doing more numbers than old Nas x
2272,2020-04-26 04:20:51,g86j81,"He’s an industry plant. He’s going to keep making money, and trust me it doesn’t take much to make the masses bob their head to shitty music. He’ll be fine. But his career is a meme. It’s played out. And I really don’t get why people defend this dude while there are TONS of hard working artists out there who really master their craft and then here comes this bozo making millions off of a meme song. Fuck that shit."
2273,2020-04-26 04:16:36,g86j81,Why are you booing me I’m right
2274,2020-04-26 04:16:12,g86j81,"I guess anything is just a hit nowadays. And even if he did, he’s still fading into obscurity."
2275,2020-04-26 04:17:41,g86j81,"You’re absolutely correct. It was supposed to be a funny song. It’s almost unfortunate for him that people thought he was serious because then he had to keep the illusion up. And ultimately, we all now see that he couldn’t keep it up."
2276,2020-04-26 04:24:02,g86j81,Because there are artists out here with a million times the talent he has but he gets put on because he started off as a Twitter comedian and got money thrown at him because music executives don’t care about quality. He was hip and trendy. And now where is he? He couldn’t keep it up because his heart wasn’t in it.
2277,2020-04-26 04:31:48,g86j81,Yeah fuck lil nas.
2278,2020-04-26 04:18:18,g86j81,I personally feel like lil nas x is like a industry plant and if he isn’t he’s like a gay superhero or some shit right? Who tf cares
2279,2020-04-26 04:18:41,g86j81,So yeah you’re right actually lol

2282,2020-05-02 17:00:15,g86j81,bro you're the only person actively thinking about Lil Nas X's career..except me because I'm here lol
2283,2020-04-26 04:30:49,g86j81,You know he dropped a remix late January right? Wouldn’t you rather he take his time to drop something of a little bit higher quality than just drop a bunch of rushed music to stay relevant?
2284,2020-05-02 16:59:39,g86j81,song came out 11 months ago lol
2285,2020-04-26 04:33:06,g86j81,How am I not surprised he rehashed an old son lmfaooo. I’m telling you he’s got no talent. His writers are busy I’m sure. But him? Fuck no dude. He needs to stay on Twitter.
2286,2020-04-26 04:43:21,g86j81,What rappers do you like?
2287,2020-04-26 04:47:38,g86j81,I could literally name every single rapper you love and for the sake of being right you just say they’re shit. This is a bad way to make a point.
2288,2020-04-26 04:51:23,g86j81,"I was genuinely curious. I see this is one of the very few times you’ve come here, and I’m going to assume you know very little about rap since XXX is the only rapper you seem to listen to. Correct me if I’m wrong tho guy."
2289,2020-04-26 04:53:01,g86j81,And now you’re assuming. What do you base that on?
2290,2020-04-26 05:00:55,g86j81,"Look you’re either an old head rap fan who is tired of where rap has gone, in which case there’s a discussion worth having, or you’re just an edgelord the rest of comment history says you are and don’t actually know much about rap, in which case any discussion would be fruitless. 

I’m pretty convinced it’s the second one but how about you just tell me which one it so I don’t have to waste my damn time."
2291,2020-04-26 05:03:20,g86j81,"You’re wasting both our times. I’m not going to sit here and list every artist I like. It even goes beyond hip hop, you don’t know me and you don’t know shit. My opinion is that lil nas is an industry plant and you can’t stop riding his dick."
2292,2020-04-26 05:13:36,g86j81,"So the second one gotcha. 

Bro I don’t even like LNX, I just think it’s sad that you came here just to shit on a kid because he hasn’t dropped in two months. Your opinion is that he couldn’t keep up, but it’s more that he had a song that broke multiple records and probably gave him enough money to not have to work for a while. Dudes probably chilling in a mansion so I don’t see how he’s taking an L. 

Idk man say what you want, it’s pretty sad to me that you got so worked up about an artist you don’t like. Maybe try putting out positive energy sometime for a change?"
2293,2020-04-26 05:15:34,g86j81,I can put out positive energy while also not kissing ass to obvious industry plants. Thanks.
2294,2020-04-26 05:17:11,g86j81,"But you don’t tho.

I’d hate to be the kinda guy to be angry about things that don’t even affect him. What a sad life."
2295,2020-04-26 05:18:31,g86j81,I’m here to have a discussion about music lol. Why can’t I say something negative all of a sudden? Answer that.

I guess that in someways the overall is kind of missing the break in the original song. The shift to country music gave kind of a break that made the rest of it high harder (relatively).  At   2:15 you have  kind of bridge/breakdown.  Adding some kind of section that breaks up the verses might help emphasis the strength of the relentless delivery.  Just some variety in the tone/structure might make the whole stronger as a composition. But overall it seems good"
2331,2020-06-26 13:19:59,hfwjv7,I'm usually not a fan of covers cause I always feel like it's recycled music but you took it in a completely different direction with the flows and delivery. I like the singing rap style but you went straight bars mode which I think really compliment your voice. I'm not sure who did you mixing but I think the mixing deff leaves a lot to be desired. With your voice and flow I think you could've really hit a new level with this song if the mixing just sounded less drier and a bit more professional. I hope I hear some original work soon and hope you keep going at these bars and bars and bars!

I dropped this one almost a year ago and when I go back and listen to it that’s the biggest thing that stands out to me. It just needs a little bit of a break between the aggressive/relentless delivery. I think at the time I was so focused on making it undeniable that my version couldn’t be debated if it was country or hip hop I went a little overboard with the relentless delivery. Although I do have a more upbeat and aggressive style naturally, I think I’m getting better at and learning how to balance things a little more. Thanks again for the listen and great feedback! 💯🙏"
2335,2020-06-30 10:16:59,hfwjv7,"Thank you for your feedback!! I actually couldn’t agree more with you!! I can’t stand the mixing on this track it drives me nuts, but it was a super rushed and last minute studio session at a lower quality studio I don’t usually go to. Lesson learned, although I’m still working on getting into a better studio situation. Hopefully I will have my own set up in the near future and can start learning some of the engineering side of things myself. I think that will really help me fully find my sound. Thanks for listening and appreciating lyricism!! 💯 Thats one thing I do pride myself on and like to think I bring to every track. The one thing I can control is my pen and the words and lyrics I write so I do that to the best of my ability!

2337,2020-06-26 05:40:04,hfwjv7,"Yeah, I think the crossover hip-hop country was part of the magic of the original, but the other part is that lil nas really does seem to have a sense of timing, he really knows when to give the song space, and that part (for me) is the thing that makes hip hop really go from impressive techniques, to a complete experience.   Some really good work though, I hope you keep working with the slightly melodic tracks, you have a good approach here"
2338,2020-06-30 10:10:26,hfwjv7,"I respect it bro absolutely. At the time when the song came out, there was a lot of debate as to whether it should be labeled a country or hip hop song and it even was labeled both at different times while they were trying to decipher. That all seemed ridiculous to me, so my goal was to show that I could make it into something that would be undeniably rap/hiphop. I have a much more aggressive style than an artist like Lil Nas X. I definitely respect him as an artist, but that is not really the type of hip hop I am into personally. I have a much more aggressive style myself and grew up listening to the golden era of hip hop where a lot of the newer styles weren’t really accepted at that time. I’m glad the game has evolved though honestly! I think the essence and core of hip hop has been lost a bit, but I think it’s grown musically as well and I believe that’s why a song like Old Town Road can be appreciated now. If that song came out in the climate of hiphop in the 90’s, it would have never been accepted. Like I said though, I am glad the genre has grown and expanded in so many ways. I was just explaining so that you can maybe understand why the differences in styles. You put any of the actual great RAPPERS of all time on that beat and tell them to rap, they will resemble more the style you heard from me than the style you heard from Lil Nas X. It’s just different. There aren’t any good quotable bars from Lil Nas X on that entire song, but musically and melodically it sounds great. The melodic sound and catchiness of the song is what the average fan of music and a newer era hiphop fan will gravitate towards, as opposed to most core hiphop fans will gravitate towards someone actually saying something in their lyrics and would take that over something that just sounds good without much substance. I personally love hiphop so much that I love and have an appreciation for it all and it’s all helped mold me into the artist I am today 💯💯 I have A LOT more where that came from, so stay tuned and you can find me on all socials @pbmogul. Thanks again for your feedback fam I really appreciate you! 💯🙏🙏"

2343,2020-06-25 00:09:22,hf9t6c,"U don’t want so many sounds clogging up the beat, simplicity is best when it boils down to it so the artist can thrive on it but sometimes it’s good to have a lot of layers goin cause some ppl like that. Jus make sure to mix it cleanly and kill it. But otherwise dont overproduce less is more"
2344,2020-06-25 09:38:22,hf9t6c,"Simple stuff is the move, right now.

Not a rant, but an observation:

Remember all it takes is for one special producer and/or artist (another key ingredient!) to push the envelope and then complex beats are going to be the new wave. Kinda like how Timbaland/Missy/Aaliyah/Ginuwine completely blew everyone away when they first got on. They knew they were ahead of the game and presented that with a ton of style and bravado. Such that, even though they were among their fellow producers, they knew they were the best. They simply caused everyone to raise their game and the producers without the same kind of touch kind of fell back. I'm thinking a new bounce will occur and the question will be, which one of these current trap producers will be able to adjust?

Music doesn't really stay still. It's the creative process. Going in chronological order starting from about 60 years ago: The Beatles pushed it, the same way The Beach Boys did, the same way Stevie Wonder did and then Michael Jackson, then hip-hop pushed it. Something's going to open and advance and I think it may be sooner rather than later. We're kind of in the spot where we're sitting still (mainly on simplicity) and that leads me to believe something going to *hit*. Potentially that one producer/artist is going to cause everyone to step their game up and then we're going to see who can adapt. A producer/artist duo may happen where the artist wants their main producer to absolutely empty their clip while they push the envelope of what the current trend is and hit a sound that becomes the new mainstream sound.

It always goes in cycles and you can see it starting right now actually:

1. Wondagurl was right on the verge of it for a minute. She has a project coming out I think where she's executive producer for the whole thing and she's stated how much she loves to make more complex beats. I think it's all women on the project, and if they raise the bar they may very well be the ones to set a new standard.
2. Kenny Beats and !llmind are inspiring and teaching a lot of newer producers on their streams. Their beats tend to have more complex drops, variations, etc.
3. DAWs are still more or less newer tech to the current generation, so we're still trying to figure out the capability. That said, there are some five year old kids right now learning how to use the DAW from their parents who have some experience with it. So I'd imagine they're going to start making a splash sometime soon and are going to have a decade of music production experience by the time they're 15.
4. It's now easier to link up musically around the world and will probably only open up more. The Asian music scene is starting to work its way into popular culture. China has an insane amount of people with absolute/perfect pitch. What it is like 60% of the musicians in China have perfect pitch compare to .01% everywhere else? Maybe a number of them do something. Remember, the Western scale is not the only one in the world, and we're starting to see more and more of the more cultural ones make their way here.
5. Must mention A.I making insane musical strides recently with the various vsts we've seen. What I'm really curious about is seeing what DeepComposer is going to be capable of. That's powered by Amazon/AWS so it's probably going to be incredible. That tech in a producer's hands will be insane and the new type of A.I, generative A.I , will be capable of actual creativity in its specialized area (something it as never capable of until recently). This is something that some kid's A.I project came up with and how it collaborated with another human musician a few months ago (starts around the 8 minute mark): [https://www.reddit.com/r/coding/comments/grrx8v/i\_made\_an\_ai\_that\_learned\_to\_make\_music/](https://www.reddit.com/r/coding/comments/grrx8v/i_made_an_ai_that_learned_to_make_music/)Again, that was some kid's code. Imagine what Amazon's AWS DeepComposer will be doing. Shit, vocalists won't be safe either, this is what another A.I just did: [https://soundcloud.com/openai\_audio/jukebox-novel\_lyrics-78968609](https://soundcloud.com/openai_audio/jukebox-novel_lyrics-78968609) and this one: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Vaporwave/comments/gg437f/ai\_understands\_and\_reproduces\_the\_essence\_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vaporwave/comments/gg437f/ai_understands_and_reproduces_the_essence_of/). Again, imagine what 10 years from now looks/sounds like.

Remember, what older people are seeing as a ceiling/limit, younger brains are seeing it as a floor."
2345,2020-06-24 21:54:44,hf9t6c,"simple is the best way to get rappers/build a listener base. 

complex is the best way to grow and improve. 

what’s more important to you at this stage?"
2346,2020-06-25 13:40:17,hf9t6c,"It really depends. There's a market for both complex and simple production. There's a line between being complex, and just having too much shit, as well as a line between simplicity and boring. 

As long as you're not crossing those lines you should be fine. But it's fairly easy to cross that line, so you just need to find a healthy balance."

2371,2020-06-21 05:00:59,hd11gg,I liked the tape but feel like its a big mistake he hasn't really dropped anything since. One year is a long time when a lot of people already only view  you as a meme.
2372,2020-06-21 06:43:58,hd11gg,"it wasnt mindblowing or anything, but for a rush up to capitalize on the old town road hype i think it was definitely better than expected. people were looking for it to flop but panini and rodeo both did numbers and were pretty solid tunes and i liked the rest of it well enough. 3 top charting songs, one of which being an insane mega hit, is absurd level of success for a rushed out 7 song ep.

i dont spin it now but i still get positive vibes from it when scrolling through my music"
2373,2020-06-21 07:07:24,hd11gg,"definitely not grammy aoty nom worthy but overhated tbh. it’s just fun feel good music, nobody’s expecting tpab from lil nas x. nothing crazy but decent. also good on nas for securing another hit in panini"
2374,2020-06-21 09:34:03,hd11gg,"Pretty cool genre-bending EP. Nothing groundbreaking, but a pretty fun listen. Not to mention LNX is just a super captivating public figure, his presence is very entertaining and lovable. It's also great to see a black LGBT figure garner so much mainstream success."
2375,2020-06-21 06:53:38,hd11gg,"This got nominated for a Grammy, never forget that. Over the likes of albums like ZUU or Bandana. Old Town Road definitely is one for the record books though"
2376,2020-06-21 05:53:40,hd11gg,"sorry but it was really really shitty. i don’t understand why it got decent reception. only worthwhile songs were old town road and panini. i really want to see who is actually listening to f9mily, kick it, bring u down, and c7osure. this is kids bop level music."
2377,2020-06-22 03:10:36,hd11gg,I heard the album for the first time because a tattoo artist in the shop where I was getting a tattoo done was playing it. I listened to the whole album in agonizing pain. The tattoo hurt so much more because of that damn album.
2378,2020-06-21 08:01:35,hd11gg,"Literally never returned to this tape. I really liked Old Town Road, the original and the remixes, and was looking forward to what else he has to offer, but this wasn't it. It seemed like the marketing machine behind him was amazing at recognizing what people want in the case of OTR, but with this tape they dropped the ball.

I honestly think with very subtle changes this EP (because calling this an album or nominating it for AOTY is ridiculous) could've been memorable. First off, F9mily and C7osure shouldn't exist. I get that Nas X enjoys making this kind of music, but honestly who's looking for indie pop-rock by a hip-hop artist in 2019? Scrap those tracks and save em for later.

Second, the two tracks with rap features were both done wrong IMO. Panini should've released with the DaBaby feature and not as a solo track with a remix, where they obviously tried to replicate the OTR formula. The track is pretty forgettable in itself, but having DaBaby on it from the start would've made it garner more attention and Baby fits the vibe of the song well.

The worst fuck up is Rodeo though. I remember that he posted a snippet before the EP dropped asking who the feature is and I remember that the entirity of twitter was screaming for it to be Travis Scott. Listen to the damn track, it's basically a western Travis Scott song and I think adding some Mike Dean synths and a good Travis feature could've made that track something great. But Cardi B was possibly one of the least fitting big mainstream artists he could've chosen for that track and to me, she ruined the entire vibe of that track, which is what would've made it great.

So all in all, this was an EP I was looking forward to and I would've loved to see Nas X shine on, but he did not deliver at all. The Grammy nominations just adds more disapointment because it was so undeserved and blocked other great projects that year from being considered. 

Could he still bounce back? Sure, the guy and his team have proven to know how to create a hit and keep it there, but at this point I'd not be surprised if his career as a mainstream artist was over."
2379,2020-06-21 08:30:34,hd11gg,"I think he’s alright as being viewed as a meme, if you check out his twitter he looks like he’s having fun being one lol"
2380,2020-06-21 13:44:02,hd11gg,"definitely his labels fault, they held back Old Town Road Music Video being released too"
2381,2020-06-21 13:26:00,hd11gg,Yeah I legitimately liked this album a lot but I'm basically forgetting about him since he hasn't had any new music in so long
2382,2020-06-21 17:44:04,hd11gg,"On the bright side he gonna start dropping soon, was teasing a song off his debut album called ""Kimbo"" the other day"
2383,2020-06-21 19:25:36,hd11gg,"It really felt like people wanted it to flop. I'm glad it wasnt complete trash. I hope he hasn't lost too much hype, I can see him being a popstar this decade"
2384,2020-06-21 18:40:43,hd11gg,"Rodeo remix was so good too, only reason it didn’t bump in the whip was the cardi verse initially imo"
2385,2020-06-21 13:27:25,hd11gg,"Even though closure or whatever that song is called should have been the popular one, because that song is amazing"

2393,2020-06-21 12:04:04,hd11gg,"I liked every song but bring you down. It's got decent reception cause it's a catchy tape. 

What i don't understand is how you like old Town Road and panini without liking Rodeo. It's a blend of the futuristic production in Panini and the Country style of old town road.

That all being said, God knows why it got Grammy nominations."
2394,2020-06-21 13:51:18,hd11gg,"Yeah he seems to like not being a regular celebrity   
  
I feel like everyone thought he was going to go into a serious music career and he just kinda didn't which is a weird decision considering he has a grammy nom, a really hard record to beat on Billboard (which will probably be there for a WHILE) and easy access to labels and execs  
  
 but hey I guess he's happy just trolling on twitter"

2619,2020-06-19 03:38:39,hb1mqa,"I think her last album dragged her rating down a bit with the users on here, a lot of people seemed to think it was bland compared to her earlier stuff. If Froot was still her most recent album I bet she would’ve gotten more 5s."

""Taylor Swift is the white girl who boasts about being able to rap the verses to 'Super Bass'.

Not even the Nicki part in 'Monster'. 'Super Bass'. That's how basic she is."""

This was rude 🤭"
2626,2020-06-18 06:25:29,hb1mqa,"I feel like CRJ is so beloved on this sub that’s she’s beyond the other artists in the top five, she’s like the “Fave Emeritus” because she’s generally so unproblematic and the fact that this entire community exists directly because of her and her music."

2628,2020-06-23 12:04:21,hb1mqa,"On the (non social-media) internet it doesn't matter what your age is, all that matters is what you put out into it - on reddit comments/posts are evaluated independently from the context of who wrote them, if they have good things to say then people will like them, if not then they won't. I wouldn't worry about feeling young since you seem perfectly well put together and articulate."
2629,2020-06-18 18:35:35,hb1mqa,Why would you be embarrassed about that lmao
2630,2020-06-17 23:33:52,hb1mqa,it's fine if you add in the lesbians and the bi's the straights are still a minority. as they should be.

2632,2020-06-18 18:52:46,hb1mqa,there are dozens of us! (specifically just over 3 dozen...)

2636,2020-06-19 04:07:55,hb1mqa,mood. legit really wish it was normalized me and my Bf get enough shit about it.

Still mostly cis, mostly straight, and mostly male. A lot closer than places like hiphopheads and indieheads though"

2644,2020-06-18 04:49:00,hb1mqa,"Well yeah, but it's a large enough sample to probably be fairly representative of the userbase. I'm really not surprised there are more men here, Reddit is like 80% men and skews younger so probably a higher LGBT+ proportion, I wouldn't be surprised if there were as many LGBT men on reddit as women total (yeah yeah yeah, not that you need to be LGBT to be a man who likes pop music, I know, but statistically speaking)."

2652,2020-06-18 01:55:34,hb1mqa,"Reading ao3 fanfics in lieu of literature is totally valid. If I could go to my library and sort between slow burn, less than 10k words, enemies-to-lovers I'd do it in a heartbeat."

2654,2020-06-18 07:54:49,hb1mqa,There's something comforting in a 100k fic where you know the worst thing that's gonna happen is a few small break ups or job change... I don't need more than that right now
2655,2020-06-18 04:42:00,hb1mqa,"I'm stuck using my library's eBooks as well and as someone without an eReader, it sucks. I hate not being able to get into a comfortable position because I need my million pound laptop that overheats and runs its loudass fan every 7 minutes, and I hate the way my eLibrary sorts its books that basically prevents you from finding anything you're not directly looking for. But....it's all we got and it's better than nothing!"
2656,2020-06-18 10:18:03,hb1mqa,"I had a Barnes and Noble nook and I was so ecstatic and then I just gave up on it because paper books are just so much better.
Amazing."

2659,2020-06-17 23:26:41,hb1mqa,very true
2660,2020-06-18 04:44:02,hb1mqa,"I dunno if it's the lack of black people which allowed the sub to become this messy or if this sub was *always* messy which turned away black people. Tbh I wouldn't mind if this sub shut down for another week or two to filter the community a bit more, I spend a lot of time here but it would be worthwhile to filter out some of the shittier members of the community. Maybe put up a donation link and hold the sub hostage until a certain goal is met lol."

2672,2020-06-18 11:30:45,hb1mqa,"I guess it just depends on how you look at books. 

I hold the Harry Potter books in insanely high regard because it's what lead me into reading, they'll always have a special place in my heart. I recall fondly sitting in my room the night PoA came out and trying to read the entire thing in one night. I remember being on vacation 2 or so weeks before GoF came out and reading the first chapter in Time magazine. But, as I explored other genres and books I found things that were more me and loved them in a different way than I loved Harry and Co.

I'll rank them as some of my favorites, but I don't think I could ever actually call it my favorite."

2682,2020-06-18 16:49:46,hb1mqa,"Also the fact that south, east, and south east asians make up approx 55% of the world population but this still apparently warrants just one “asian” label"
2683,2020-06-18 04:09:14,hb1mqa,"Many people fail to realize the image that people get when they hear ""Asian"" tends to be of someone of east asian descent. This usually annoys the rest of us as we kind of feel pushed aside from conversations."

OBVIOUSLY not everyone, as you and I stand here to prove, but everybody seems to joke around calling each other 'sis', and referring to our userbase as 'the gays', so it would make sense to me if that's how it was. I think actual straight cis men in here are less than 40% of the population."

Age wise it doesnt match. Racial demo it does. But its also just a random coincidence

Also Its barley 50% white if you dont count white hispamics/latinos. With them its over 60% white"
2716,2020-06-18 11:57:29,hb1mqa,"I mean and? 

Guess its interesting That the age demo is off but racially its on point.

Also popheads isnt actually the USA so some of the demo will be off"

Either way, their phrasing made it seem like they were doubting that even if it *were* a random sample, it wouldn't accurately reflect the population unless it involved, like, most of the population, so I guess we were both doing bad stats."

2725,2020-06-18 10:14:15,hb1mqa,"I will break it down;

1) previews didn’t originally interest me

2) not even on purpose I rarely seem to end up enjoying the BP winner

3) it’s my brother’s favorite movie of all time and dumb sibling emotions dictate that I can’t enjoy it

3B) my brothers made some dumb ass crack about how I can’t handle movies with subtitles so part of it is not watching in protest because ever since he got a job ripping tickets at our local theater he thinks he is some movie god

It’s in our house. I’ll get to it eventually."
2726,2020-06-18 22:21:00,hb1mqa,"It's miserable but fun enough. It's soapy like the Great Gatsby, it has a lot of drama yes, probably because of it's religious nature. But it also gives hope in being able to redeem yourself and recieve mercy. I can't say the same for A Little Life I don't get why people would enjoy reading that. And to have it as a favourite book is worrying 🥴"
2727,2020-06-18 14:54:13,hb1mqa,"TIL that Charli is half Indian. I’m also Indian / White mixed so that’s cool that’s she like me. 

And yeah although I’m mixed, I would consider myself white passing as well. Even though being white passing has its privileges when you live in a majority white area, I definitely feel more disconnected from my Indian heritage or when I’m surrounded by majority Indians, I feel like I stick out like a sore thumb. Being biracial is interesting for sure"

The latest fast food music turnup artist might have a big first week but that doesn't mean the sales will continue, and a slightly less mainstream artist might end up doing way more than their first week in lifetime sales."

2774,2020-06-28 10:08:22,hgzqfz,This probably a dumb question but I thought 10+ times Platinum went Diamond? Or does the artist have to request the certification once they're eligible to get it?

2791,2020-06-27 20:46:55,hgzqfz,Both of their songs

2795,2020-06-27 22:07:13,hgzqfz,It's got a good groove going on but once you hear it over and over again (i.e. work retail) you kind of want to shoot the speakers out

2797,2020-06-27 20:29:26,hgzqfz,"It probably went 11x Platinum a while ago but wasn't certified until now. I think the certifications have to be purchased by the label so if they don't bother doing it, the song won't be certified"

Before that his last cert was in 2008 and it was *Untitled* being certified Gold."
2799,2020-06-28 21:27:25,hgzqfz,"They still do more times plat after you hit 10. I would guess you get a diamond plaq for 11x even if you didn't certify at 10x

10 is diamond thought that's correct."

not gonna go through and look through the previous certs for all the things certified in may.

you'll see him in june."
2805,2020-06-29 02:41:53,hgzqfz,This sub also thought Jay Electronica would do 100k first week. It (the sub) simply isn’t a good representation of what music actually gets streamed / radio play.

2813,2020-06-27 20:16:28,hgzqfz,"In the mainstream, yes, but he had well over a dozen singles out and mixtape before that song dropped"

Congrats, you found a guy here who said that. Definitely wasn’t the consensus, people were surprised how much it sold and attributed it to Jay-Z"
2819,2020-06-28 17:22:14,hgzqfz,Not always though. Arista and Jive are not spending another dime on Clipse after the label fallout. Only plaque they have is a gold Lord Willin. Nothing for Grinding etc. And Nielsen says LW was at 950k albums sold in 2009. You think this album didn't go plat in those 10+ years?
2820,2020-06-28 17:18:15,hgzqfz,"Sure you mentioned that it can happen, but then you went on to say that its a very good way to compare popularity. I just don't think it's true because that flaw is petty huge considering we don't know if something is below gold or if its 10x Plat and they just never bought the plaque"
2821,2020-06-27 20:42:24,hgzqfz,Lol sorry I didn’t notice Mike Stud was among the many names listed. Kinda just skimmed past the first 5 or so names

2825,2020-06-29 11:32:38,hgzqfz,"No people were surprised how little it sold, because Jay-Z was on it."
2826,2020-06-28 17:37:25,hgzqfz,"Ah that makes sense. I think I was thinking about more recent stuff, like last 10 yrs"
2827,2020-06-29 04:32:33,hgzqfz,Maybe not as good as having lifetime sales # or a year long sales #. But still better than first week numbers I think.
2828,2020-06-28 17:58:05,hgzqfz,"Taylor Swift - Shake It Off

Robin Thicke - Blurred Lines

Rixton - Me & My Broken Heart (I had to look up who this one was by, who tf is Rixton)

2836,2020-08-20 01:31:42,icqt57,It's such a weird issue. Like if I search a specific song or album from Lil Nas X I can find it but his artist page is empty. Hopefully it just fixes itself.

2843,2020-08-17 02:40:21,ib5v00,they deleted the post 😠😭
2844,2020-08-17 06:47:47,ib5jv6,"i'm wondering how the fuck the kid hasn't literally done anything throughout this whole quarantine what the fuck are him and his team up to it's like damn i'm suprised asf dude has yet to really do anything in terms of output this year after the steam he has going from last year, kinda crazy to me idk it must be hard for him to navigate going forward image wise n all that especially w what we're currently going through but it's feeling like so much wasted potential at this point and i highly doubt that he wants to be doing this with his time / career right now so it really sucks but that's the industry bb will be great to finally see his next move when it finally comes around shoutout to him tho :)"
2845,2020-08-17 15:21:55,ib5jv6,"well whatever stroke i had reading this paragraph is gone now, he hasn’t been doing nothing all quarantine he’s been putting LOTS of time and effort in to perfecting and finishing off the album, maybe if you payed attention to his social media’s you would know that. no potential was wasted and he definitely DOES want to be in the industry and make music"
2846,2020-08-17 19:35:25,ib5jv6,"i’m literally not a fan like that at all just a supporter so it’s cool to hear what he’s been up to. still feel like if this corona thing hasn’t went down dude would be doing a lot more right now with his career (singles, shows, merch etc.) as would many others ofc but just my humble opinion. that’s great he’s still working but the fact that the only thing that myself and the general public has seen from a headline about this dude all year was the thing about him tweeting for people to stop clowning him about that leaked playboi carti snippet lololol. i just thot there woulda finally been something by now. dude has legit remixed the same three songs for over a fuckin year so just wondering when something new will finally come about lol. his career basically hasn’t even started yet so issa big deal. when i talk about wasted potential i’m talking about the fact so much time has passed since this dude has had his legemdary run and all of that attention that he got from it just goes away more and more by the day, that’s just the numbers game bb. but that’s cool news little titanic. he’ll be fine i’m sure just hope he been doing his thing. perhaps he’ll drop a single / vid next month and the album will be out by november / december"
2847,2020-08-17 00:32:27,ib3ofk,"Hell nah I’ll always say this would’ve been the most perfect tracklist possible

2853,2020-08-16 21:04:40,iazslq,"agree with a few things, disagree with a lot"
2854,2020-08-16 23:53:53,iazslq,What about self made beat
2855,2020-08-17 07:43:35,iazslq,"I honestly think taking a capital steez approach would have been the best way to handle any posthumous release, release all the unreleased music in it's current form, in one project."
2856,2020-08-17 07:55:31,iazslq,what about the mov4 songs
2857,2020-08-16 21:05:37,iazslq,One question I always have it what would even be the point of having a greatest hits album?? What is the point ion really understand what benefits come from it.
2858,2020-11-10 01:56:02,iazslq,"Skins should be at the early/mid 2019. I think it would be cooler. I dont like the tracks chosen for the deluxe tho, they could be songs of the project, not from a deluxe version, but I still dont like them as songs on SKINS... So yeah still I think i'd fuck more with the 10 tracks. I think overall only 17 & ? should have deluxe versions.

Overall the doc I think should have.. I don't know. It should be something mysterious. With unreleased stuff, new stuff, idk, stuff that we dont know.

I like how the project is going to be released on 2021... I think late 2020 could work too, so they can perfect everything. But I really dont know about this tracklist. It should be something different. But I'm unsure because I don't know the other songs that is still on the vault.. So yeah idk what should be included to make a whole tracklist. Obviously songs like ATTENTION! & Ex Bitch should be there because these are the best ones.

And overall I have an idea, the producers should recycle songs, like, I wouldnt bother if they mixed various songs to make something AMAZING. Like how [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDKtrnCWFX4) or [how this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2VuKScIeEY) is mixed together in something perfect.

I dont think the idea of making a mixtape compilation would be cool overall, some of these songs should be only singles & features (& very few of them), because I think bvf needs to be the last album. And yeah I think it would be the better thing if possible to not release like 10 singles per year. That would be fucked.

But overall with alot of stuff that I disagree on yours I still respect & like your vision. This is good!"
2859,2020-08-16 20:43:35,iazslq,Thanks😁
2860,2020-08-17 00:05:21,iazslq,"Oooh, i forgot abt that.. lemme add"
2861,2020-08-18 20:10:27,iazslq,that wouldn't be good for anybody lol
2862,2020-08-17 11:06:14,iazslq,"The only one that still wouldve been released is Sauce!, the others would be given to different artists to use."
2863,2020-08-16 21:24:46,iazslq,i don’t really know the benefit either but would it help keep x on billboard longer? A compilation of all his most streamed songs would stay on billboard much longer than 17 and ? If that’s how it works
2864,2020-08-16 21:11:17,iazslq,"Idk, I just put it because almost every artist that Ive seen that died had one like 2pac, biggie, michael Jackson, so I just thought X should have one too."
2865,2020-08-16 20:53:31,iazslq,"Yeah, I would have put juice on kill my vibe and put Rick Ross back on I changes her life and lil Wayne back on school shooters and kept Kemba on it"
2866,2020-08-16 21:26:56,iazslq,I don’t see why anyone who isn’t already streaming those songs would go stream them just cuz they’re rereleasing them
2867,2020-08-16 21:37:04,iazslq,"brings attention back to the songs, plus like juamcena says it does keep x on the billboard 200 a lot longer, plus would mean he has one of the most streamed ‘albums’ ever"
2868,2020-08-16 21:33:23,iazslq,"yeah idk but queen, pac, biggie, guns n roses, and more are still on billboard because of their greatest hits albums. I guess it can also introduce a new fan to an artists ""best"" songs."
2869,2020-08-16 13:27:28,iarucl,Aww when did Kevin say he doesnt care to rap anymore. Sounded like he was having so much fun with technical difficulties.
2870,2020-08-16 12:59:55,iarucl,"Hoping the date is revealed along with the name or at least the month it comes out like what they did with ginger

(He also said they played Shia the album a few days ago and he said it was their best yet, but also inspired them to change some things)"
2871,2020-08-16 15:27:48,iarucl,praying for a peggy feature 🙏🙏
2872,2020-08-16 15:41:27,iarucl,"If we don’t get a Henock “Snapchat” Sileshi feature, we riot"
2873,2020-08-16 13:20:45,iarucl,And at least one of the features is a female vocalist (Deb Never again? Maybe 100 Gecs?)
2874,2020-08-16 16:55:56,iarucl,Honestly guys kevin is most definitely lying about not rapping.
2875,2020-08-16 15:33:55,iarucl,Yo where’d you hear Romil and Kev were making a record label called Video Store?
2876,2020-08-16 13:52:33,iarucl,When did Kev say he didn’t care to rap anymore?
2877,2020-08-16 15:41:27,iarucl,Ig he wasnt lying about wanting to the torch😔
2878,2020-08-16 15:53:47,iarucl,i really hope the kerwin performance is arizona baby live. we’ve literally gotten no live performances of it.
2879,2020-08-16 14:46:18,iarucl,"man it's kinda lame to see how artists try too hard not to be called ""only rapper"" nowadays"
2880,2020-08-16 16:13:00,iarucl,wait when did we find out that lil nas x isn’t gonna be on the album?
2881,2020-08-16 19:30:28,iarucl,how i do i get in contact with kevin about being an engineer lmao im ready
2882,2020-08-16 18:27:15,iarucl,Gimme clairo as that female feature
2883,2020-08-16 18:31:08,iarucl,Wait what’s BH6 I haven’t been keeping up with BH in a while and does this mean Kevin is going to not rap as much or focus on solo work ?
2884,2020-08-17 00:27:14,iarucl,I remember the last time they said the new album would be revealed...3 months ago
2885,2020-08-16 13:51:20,iarucl,[deleted]
2886,2020-08-16 14:11:18,iarucl,I don’t think that means he’s done rapping I think it just means he’s putting a lot more focus on production
2887,2020-08-16 17:22:47,iarucl,"wow they said that about ginger too, it’s a very good sign if every new album they make is better than anything they’ve made before"
2888,2020-08-16 19:09:50,iarucl,Man I wonder where peggys been at
2889,2020-08-16 17:23:04,iarucl,we don’t want HK on Snapchat we want him on BH6
2890,2020-08-16 16:06:35,iarucl,sza was hanging with them last year
2891,2020-08-16 14:43:41,iarucl,Dua Lipa or Clairo maybe
2892,2020-08-16 20:19:04,iarucl,I was just listening to 100 gecs yesterday and thinking how sick they'd be on BH song!
2893,2020-08-16 17:14:38,iarucl,Definitely nicki Minaj    /s
2894,2020-08-16 20:20:49,iarucl,"Just like ""Ginger is a summertime album"""
2895,2020-08-16 14:12:11,iarucl,He replied to a comment on the album name post saying he’s focusing more on production
2896,2020-08-17 02:04:16,iarucl,Pass the*
2897,2020-08-16 14:54:09,iarucl,what does this have to do with Kevin
2898,2020-08-16 18:15:14,iarucl,Kevin replied to someone on insta saying he hadn’t sent his verse yet. I hope he actually is on the album cause it’d be fire
2899,2020-08-16 19:04:32,iarucl,BH6 = sixth BH album (the next one)
2900,2020-08-17 00:39:14,iarucl,they prolly made like 3 albums since GINGER and we gonna only get the third one
2901,2020-08-16 14:00:57,iarucl,"Fair, I remember Kevin talking about wanting to do other projects. But not specifically quitting rapping.

I just loved what he put out in Technical Difficulties that itll be missed if he does not rap on bh6."
2902,2020-08-16 20:29:31,iarucl,Kinda like sat iii being the “last studio album by BROCKHAMPTON” or whatever
2903,2020-08-16 17:52:21,iarucl,hopefully he means the way tyler does
2904,2020-08-16 18:16:34,iarucl,"Yea but tbf they’ll say that with any album, what’s Shia gonna say? This shit is ok, “it’s not sat II though”"
2905,2020-08-16 19:25:20,iarucl,This would get him some promo
2906,2020-08-16 17:28:53,iarucl,[deleted]
2907,2020-08-16 19:09:43,iarucl,i would literally cry if we got a bearface and clairo duet
2908,2020-08-16 21:29:00,iarucl,bearface x clairo would make me cry ngl
2909,2020-08-16 20:22:30,iarucl,"“don’t believe his lies” rings true. Sorry kevin
if you are reading. I love you but this is true sometimes."
2910,2020-08-16 14:25:54,iarucl,:(
2911,2020-08-16 14:26:55,iarucl,What insta account was that on?
2912,2020-08-16 15:46:20,iarucl,But did he say he’s stopping rapping? Just cause he’s focusing on production more doesn’t mean “guys Kevin’s not gonna be on new album”
2913,2020-08-16 15:06:48,iarucl,he clearly isn't interested in making music forever (which is respectable) and besides he describes brockhampton as pop music and now he's stepping back from rapping :(
2914,2020-08-17 08:40:09,iarucl,not sending a verse doesn't mean not gonna be on the album. if anything it is confirmation he will be on the album. keep hope!
2915,2020-08-16 19:05:12,iarucl,Oh Alr thanks didn’t know that’s what ppl were calling it
2916,2020-08-17 03:20:47,iarucl,I don't understand that imo bad music >>> no music. And that's assuming it's bad which it probably isn't
2917,2020-08-16 15:55:08,iarucl,assuming wake up call is still on the album we know he’s at least on one track i’m sure he won’t be totally missing
2918,2020-08-16 18:16:23,iarucl,Tyler said he was gonna do a lot more rapping on his next project tho
2919,2020-08-16 18:32:27,iarucl,If he didn’t like it he probably just wouldn’t have spoken on it
2920,2020-09-02 18:09:15,iarucl,"I feel like Shia would be honest, they have a good relationship with him"
2921,2020-08-16 20:47:52,iarucl,But when it comes to money he probably thinks that these neighbours is a no show
2922,2020-08-16 17:29:41,iarucl,same lol szas one of my fav artists ever
2923,2020-08-16 14:27:14,iarucl,His main account
2924,2020-08-16 15:47:28,iarucl,He said “I don’t care to rap anymore” so sounds like not much rapping. Still could be hooks and singing doe
2925,2020-08-16 16:56:45,iarucl,the chances of this being true are really slim. don’t worry lol.
2926,2020-08-16 20:17:47,iarucl,"Absolutely love Igor, but also love the prospect of another rap-centric album from Tyler."
2927,2020-08-16 18:31:47,iarucl,Where’d he say this?
2928,2020-08-16 18:36:58,iarucl,"He was literally with them when they played what was he gonna do just walk out the room? And I’m not saying he didn’t like it, it’s just polite to say it’s their best"
2929,2020-08-17 09:05:12,iarucl,He be out in Bed-Stuy chilling with his feet up
2930,2020-08-16 14:42:35,iarucl,has he deleted the post you're talking about since? I can't find anything newer than his post from august 4th on his main
2931,2020-08-16 15:49:20,iarucl,Yea but like another person said in this thread Kevin always says he doesn’t want to rap anymore then the next project what do we get? More Kevin bars
2932,2020-08-16 20:19:22,iarucl,"I desperately want him to do a horror concept album the same way he made IGOR a love concept album. It could give him a lot of opportunity to rap and sing, and experiment with his sound."
2933,2020-08-16 18:39:07,iarucl,"pretty sure he said something of the sort on instagram a while back, and it makes sense too considering he’s been doing a lot of features recently"
2934,2020-08-16 18:38:30,iarucl,No it’s not
2935,2020-08-16 14:56:33,iarucl,[here it is](https://www.reddit.com/r/brockhampton/comments/iahb5k/looks_like_the_new_album_wont_have_much_rapping/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)
2936,2020-08-16 14:55:51,iarucl,Yeah he must’ve deleted it. There should be screenshots of his comment somewhere on this sub
2937,2020-08-16 18:39:29,iarucl,Ok

2941,2020-08-16 08:56:51,iao6w9,there’s been lots of rumours and hints of a 69 x youngboy collab
2942,2020-08-16 07:24:50,iao6w9,"There’s a better chance of Tory Lanez on the album than Lil Nas X. Lil Nas seems like a random feature,... all ik is he said sum on 69’s first IG live after prison & that’s it. + is he still making music like that anymore ?"
2943,2020-08-16 12:19:49,iao6w9,Diplo for sure
2944,2020-08-16 08:07:59,iao6w9,I think we are getting another Nicki song because I heard she allegedly signed a contract to make 4 songs with 69.
2945,2020-08-16 12:04:32,iao6w9,[deleted]
2946,2020-08-16 11:54:34,iao6w9,"As they say tory is cancelled because he shot meg
Guess who cancelled too! 6ix so maybe tory stop giving af about culture and do a song"
2947,2020-08-16 07:52:01,iao6w9,"Prediction: Lil AK (he already played the snippet of their song), canon f8 , another nicki song , Tory lanez, Kanye west, lill tjay
Trife Drew? What snippet are you referring to? Are you sure you arent thinking of Canon f8."
2948,2020-08-16 10:56:51,iao6w9,Hopefully
2949,2020-08-16 08:02:56,iao6w9,"He got an album coming out soon, he supported trollz when it was out and was liking 69s post around that time. I can see 69 working with him due to the fact that he has the longest reigning number 1 and a diamond record."
2950,2020-08-16 18:10:31,iao6w9,Tory shot a bitch he way too controversial I don’t 69 wants to get even more blackballed working with him
2951,2020-08-16 12:52:21,iao6w9,Sorry who ?
2952,2020-08-16 13:25:34,iao6w9,They're really gonna be using each other till 2045 😭😭😭
2953,2020-08-16 10:57:17,iao6w9,Hopefully
2954,2020-08-16 12:07:11,iao6w9,6ix won’t care
2955,2020-08-16 12:07:21,iao6w9,Exactly
2956,2020-08-16 07:56:32,iao6w9,Lil Ak's snippet is for Akademiks' new project not 6ix9ine's
2957,2020-08-16 08:05:22,iao6w9,Lil tjay??? nah but that would sound fire. And the trife drew snippet he’s talking about is the one he posted on his story “gotta keep it on my body” it went like that I can see that being on the album because trife drew never released that song and the caption of that post said “you ready”
2958,2020-08-16 10:57:47,iao6w9,This snippet https://youtu.be/MdRU9qJq0qc and also the lil ak song is for akademiks project not 6ix9ines
2959,2020-08-16 11:19:41,iao6w9,kanye said he is now making only religous music or sum like that
2960,2020-08-16 13:05:14,iao6w9,Diplo
2961,2020-08-16 18:42:04,iao6w9,He dropped a verse for a ty dolla sign song he just didn’t swear which I see could happen with 6ix9ine
2962,2020-08-16 13:16:40,iao6w9,Isn’t he just some producer who’s a nobody

We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion).

My biggest and really only disagreement though is with the only time I feel alive. The last little part with X I love.

2991,2020-08-12 16:59:32,i8h93k,I don’t mind it if it’s used for artistic expression but as a way to hide your talentless vocal. Hell no.
2992,2020-08-12 17:01:55,i8h93k,"Musician here: I don't care for it under certain circumstances. Like when it's used as an expressive tool (Cloudrap, etc.). I just don't like when creators aren't genuine about it and straight up lie to their audience... That stuff happens way too often. I also think it's unfair towards very talented people that don't need to or can't use it, like Singers on Broadway, Opera or genres that did not adopt autotune yet.

Last thought: it is just like Photoshop on Instagram, just for the voice. People should decide themselves if they like or want to support that..."
2993,2020-08-12 16:57:47,i8h93k,I agree but sometimes the person modifies their voice so much..that it is no longer sounds human..and just seems foolish

3001,2020-08-12 03:29:22,i865rv,I know exactly which music in the game you’re talking about and I hear Old Town Road in my head whenever that music plays.

I've been wistening to Awtewnative Death avant gawde metaw since befowe you wewe bown (ciwca **2008)**.

I once stood up to the pastow at chuwch (with a swayew mewch shiwt on) and asked him ""*If god exists how come we have eviw in the wowwd""*, He then fainted and aww of the pawish convewted to atheism. When my dad was teaching me about good and bad I witewawwy wead him Nitche's ***beyond badness and goodness*** outwoud fow thwee houws and convewted him to neewism.

# WANT

Needwess to say I'm not a nowmie pop posew who wistens to wapcwap, I'm a weaw man with **weaw** taste, onwy wisten to **weaw music.** I mawwied my fiancé aftew buwning down a chuwch and we sewved the bwood of the pwiest as wine whiwe pwaying behemoth.

Onwy metaw and sonic soundtwacks shouwd be awwowed the west of """"""music"""""" shouwd be buwned by the state at the town squawe. They awe cowwupting ouw youth with DUMB STUPID POP INDUSTWIAW Music wike TAYWOW SWIFT.

Now boys awe stawting to PUT ON MAKE UP (not the metaw kind) and DO THE GAY. Whewe awe theiw pawents, whewe is the state. Why do we weguwate chemicaws and phawmaceuticaws but don't weguwate music, at some point you have to be consistent. 

Is this weawwy what society wants? Wappews mumbwing about mumbwing? Men with pink dweads? Women singing? What next? WHAT NEXT? Is wap cwap witewatuwe now? Awe we going to teach wap cwap to chiwdwen  ? Sewiouswy?

# SONIC SOUNDTWACKS

Sonic soundtwacks awe even beyond metaw. Not onwy awe they weaw music, they awe the pinnacwe of human achievements. Ouw species went to the moon and back. We've expwowed the depths of the ocean and anawysed the smawwest of ewements. We discovewed the atom. We invented papew cwips. But what is it that makes us human? Sonic soundtwacks. Sonic is in fact, in the stywe of Mw The Jokew, a metonymy fow the society in which we wive. Sonic wepwesents what is weft of the most pewsecuted minowity in the wowwd, stwaight white wepubwican mawes. He is the puwest wepwesentation of this secwuded section of society. His soundtwacks awe ouw anthems. When we sing them, we wive. When we sing them, we caww out fow god and his son. When we sing them, we awe bown again.

Sonic soundtwacks awe ouw bibwe. We howd them deaw and pway them ovew taywow swift when she comes up. They pwotect us fwom the cuwtuwaw mawxists coming to destwoy the industwy by incwuding women.

# Metaw

Metaw is wess puwe than Sonic soundtwacks, but it is stiww weaw music. Weaw as in descended fwom the gods, weveawed to ouw ancestows. When we wisten to death metaw, is is Gabwiew we heaw singing angewic wevewations. The pop satanic industwy is twying to oppwess metaw by making us wisten to Wiw nas x and cawdi B. We might have been weakened but we awe not dead

# WOCK AND WOWW

Some of it is weaw music some of it is eviw pop masquewading as godwy sounds. You have to be awawe of theiw methods to diagnose the fawse messiahs.

# CWASSICAW MUSIC

Cwassicaw music is pwoto sonic soundtwacks. Mozawt was decent and definitewy paved the way, but he was no sonic. In the end it was a cawcuwated effowt by god to cweated the heavenwy puwe musician that is sonic. Sonic might even be a pwophet ow even god's second son but thewe is disagweement amongst academics.

# WAP

3030,2020-08-05 22:06:15,i4ez5i,"# MY LIFE ACHIEVEMENTS

I've been listening to Alternative Death avant garde metal since before you were born (circa **2008)**. I personally beat up 2 popheads for refusing to listen to my rant about britney spears at their wedding ceremony and when my mom confiscated my iron maiden vinyl I literally locked myself in my room for 4 hours. I once stood up to the pastor at church (with a slayer merch shirt on) and asked him ""*If god exists how come we have evil in the world""*, He then fainted and all of the parish converted to atheism. When my dad was teaching me about good and bad I literally read him Nitche's ***beyond badness and goodness*** outloud for three hours and converted him to neelism.

# RANT

Needless to say I'm not a normie pop poser who listens to rapcrap, I'm a real man with **real** taste, only listen to **real music.** I married my fiancé after burning down a church and we served the blood of the priest as wine while playing behemoth. BEHEMOTH. BEHEMOTH IS THE NEIGHBORHOOD'S FAVORITE BAND. Whether they like it or not. Because if they don't, they die.

Only metal and sonic soundtracks should be allowed the rest of """"""music"""""" should be burned by the state at the town square. They are corrupting our youth with DUMB STUPID POP INDUSTRIAL Music like TAYLOR SWIFT.

Now boys are starting to PUT ON MAKE UP (not the metal kind) and DO THE GAY. Where are their parents, where is the state. Why do we regulate chemicals and pharmaceuticals but don't regulate music, at some point you have to be consistent. 

Is this really what society wants? Rappers mumbling about mumbling? Men with pink dreads? Women singing? What next? WHAT NEXT? Is rap crap literature now? Are we going to teach rap crap to children  ? Seriously?

# SONIC SOUNDTRACKS

Sonic soundtracks are even beyond metal. Not only are they real music, they are the pinnacle of human achievements. Our species went to the moon and back. We've explored the depths of the ocean and analysed the smallest of elements. We discovered the atom. We invented paper clips. But what is it that makes us human? Sonic soundtracks. Sonic is in fact, in the style of Mr The Joker, a metonymy for the society in which we live. Sonic represents what is left of the most persecuted minority in the world, straight white republican males. He is the purest representation of this secluded section of society. His soundtracks are our anthems. When we sing them, we live. When we sing them, we call out for god and his son. When we sing them, we are born again.

Sonic soundtracks are our bible. We hold them dear and play them over taylor swift when she comes up. They protect us from the cultural marxists coming to destroy the industry by including women.

# Metal

Metal is less pure than Sonic soundtracks, but it is still real music. Real as in descended from the gods, revealed to our ancestors. When we listen to death metal, is is Gabriel we hear singing angelic revelations. The pop satanic industry is trying to oppress metal by making us listen to Lil nas x and cardi B. We might have been weakened but we are not dead

&#x200B;

Life will go on 

&#x200B;

Metal will prevail

&#x200B;

Real music will win over the satanic pop industry

&#x200B;

We will murder ariana grande and use her skull as an album cover 

&#x200B;

# ROCK AND ROLL

Some of it is real music some of it is evil pop masquerading as godly sounds. You have to be aware of their methods to diagnose the false messiahs.

# CLASSICAL MUSIC

Classical music is proto sonic soundtracks. Mozart was decent and definitely paved the way, but he was no sonic. In the end it was a calculated effort by god to created the heavenly pure musician that is sonic. Sonic might even be a prophet or even god's second son but there is disagreement amongst academics.

# RAP

= CRAP. Nuff said.  Rap and music (true music) are leagues apart. If you've read the philosopher ben shapiro you know what I'm talking about."

Sonic 🦔 soundtracks 🎼 are even 🌃 beyond 👉 metal 🌛🔪🤘. Not only are they real 💯 music 🎧, they are the pinnacle 👌 of human 👤 achievements 🏆. Our species 🐒 went 🏃 to the moon ☁🌚💦 and back 🔙. We've 👫 explored the depths 🤔🙀👽 of the ocean 🌊 and analysed the smallest ▪ of elements 💦🔥🌎. We discovered 🕵🏽 the atom 🤓🥜. We invented ⚒ paper 🧻 clips 🔫. But 🍑 what is it that makes 🛠 us 👨 human 👤? Sonic 🦔 soundtracks 🎼🎹🔊. Sonic 🦔 is in fact ☑, in the style 😎 of Mr 😳😀 The Joker 😂👄, a metonymy for the society 🤵👥🌃 in which we live 😩. Sonic 🍆 represents 🇺🇸 what is left 👈 of the most persecuted 👮‍♂️ minority 👶 in the world 🌍, straight 📏 white ⚪ republican 🐘 males 👦. He 👥 is the purest ⚜ representation 👩‍💼👨‍💼 of this secluded ➕ section 📦 of society 👥. His 💦 soundtracks 🎼 are our anthems 🇺🇸. When ⏰ we sing 🎶 them, we live 😩. When ⏰ we sing 🎶 them, we call 📲 out for god 😇 and his 👋 son 👨‍👦. When ⏰ we sing 🎤👄 them, we are born 👶 again ❌😬. 

Sonic 🦔💨💬 soundtracks 🎼 are our bible 😇😋🙏🏽. We hold 👫☝ them dear 🔆📣 and play 🎽 them over 😳🙊💦 taylor 👸 swift 🏃 when 🍑 she 👩 comes 💦 up ⬆. They protect 🛡⚔ us 👨 from the cultural ⛩ marxists coming 💦 to destroy 💥 the industry ❗🏭 by including ✔ women 👩. 

# Metal 🤘 

Metal 🎤 is less 👆🏿➖ pure 😩 than Sonic 🦔💨💬 soundtracks 🎼, but 🍑 it is still 🤞🙌 real 💯 music 🎶. Real 😍 as in descended 😱😲 from the gods 🙏🏿, revealed 💩👿 to our ancestors 👴. When 🕰⏰ we listen 👂 to death 💀 metal 🤘, is is Gabriel 👼 we hear 👂 singing 🎶 angelic 😇 revelations 💡. The pop 💥 satanic 👺 industry 🏭 is trying 😼👌💥 to oppress 😡 metal 🌛🔪🤘 by making 🖕 us 👨👩 listen 👂 to Lil 🐣 nas ❌ x ❌ and cardi B 🅱. We might 💪 have been weakened but 🤔 we are not dead 💀☠ 



Life 💓 will go 👉 on 🔛 



Metal 🎤 will prevail 🇰🇵 



Real 😍 music 🎵🔊 will win 🏆 over 🔁 the satanic 👺 pop 💥 industry ❗🏭 



We will murder 🔫🗡💣 ariana 👻👑💦 grande ☕ and use 🏻 her 👩 skull 💀 as an album 💽 cover 📔 



# ROCK 🎸 AND ROLL 🙄📴 

Some of it is real 💯 music 🎶 some of it is evil 😈 pop 🎉 masquerading as godly 😩 sounds 🔊. You 👈 have to be aware 👀 of their methods 🍽 to diagnose 😰😷 the false ❌ messiahs 👼. 

# CLASSICAL 🕹 MUSIC 🎶 

Classical 🎻 music 🎧 is proto 💪 sonic 😳 soundtracks 🎼🎹🔊. Mozart 😂 was decent 🏨🏫 and definitely ✊🏻 paved the way ↕, but 🍑 he 👨 was no 🙅 sonic 🍆. In the end 🔚 it was a calculated 📱 effort 💪 by god 🙏 to created 💯 the heavenly ☁👨 pure 😩 musician 🎧 that is sonic 🏃🏻. Sonic 🦔💨 might 🔍 even 🌃 be a prophet 👋☪ or even 🌃 god's 🙏😇 second 🕑 son 👦 but 🍑 there is disagreement 👎 amongst 💩🙋 academics 🏫. 

# RAP 🔥🎤 

= CRAP 💩. Nuff 🇺🇸🗣🤬 said 🗣. Rap 🎤 and music 🎶 (true 💯 music 🎧) are leagues 💪🏻💂🏻🇽 apart 💖💕💓. If you've read 📖 the philosopher 🤓😎😒 ben 👨🏻‍🎓 shapiro 👨🏻 you 👈 know 🤔👀 what I'm 👌 talking 🗣 about."

The leftist cucked reporter starts seizing on his feet, shooting blood and bubbly saliva out of his mouth. His eyes are reversed and only the white part can be seen.

As his seizure and convulsion gets more powerful, his pants drop exposing his communist peepee. He is cumming violantly and silmultaniosly shitting explosive diarrhea.

The ben shapiro keeps babbling about something being hypothetical and logically speaking as his crowd are screaming their heads off.

The leftist cuckorter explodes raining down small particles of shart and man juice. Another leftist got owned that day.

3063,2020-08-04 04:28:11,i39v2u,i like tempo change and modulation.  i grew tired of eq gimmickry in general and sampling or replicating dusty vinyl back in the 90s
3064,2020-08-04 04:55:09,i39v2u,"Im a sucker for throwing in an orchestra instrument, like when beats have a string section or saxophone. It really makes it sound unique and refined. 

I also love acoustic guitars."
3065,2020-08-04 07:08:11,i39v2u,"Favorites: 

- tape stops 
-transitions 

I haven’t heard enough terrible gimmicks to list some least favorites. 

But Im actually a fan of the melody dropping out and leaving just the drums. With the right artist on the beat, it can go hard (ex King Von - Crazy Story). Kinda depends how good the drums are and how good the artist is. Sounds cool when done right but I generally don’t ever leave the drums by themselves"
3066,2020-08-04 06:36:31,i39v2u,"Favorites:  
\-Glides. I grew up/live in Los Angeles and all those west coast bangers slid those basslines. People say it's a recent gimmick when in fact it's simply good music that has stood the test of time.  
\-Carefully selected microtonal notes.  
\-Music that has a great groove and something to dance to.

Least:  
\-When you can tell people are getting too experimental and it doesn't even sound like hip-hop anymore. There is such thing as pushing the boundaries but there is also such a thing as being way too far-fetched.  
\-People throwing drops everywhere and essentially destroying a beat's flow.

In general, I'm not really a fan of the head-nodding battle beats compared to beats that create pockets for solid songwriting. I can appreciate the production skills required in the former though."
3067,2020-08-04 04:55:56,i39v2u,"As long as the drums and bass are good, I think it can be a cool way to change up the track and catch people’s attention."
3068,2020-08-04 15:35:39,i39v2u,"I love it when people make a real effort to have a transition to tempo change like Oh My Dis Side or Nights, really shakes up the track"
3069,2020-08-04 15:35:57,i39v2u,"same, agree completely"
3070,2020-08-04 15:36:25,i39v2u,"I think it depends on how dense the drums are, so it works on tracks like Kings Dead but not tracks like Rodeo"
3071,2020-08-04 15:37:41,i39v2u,"oh yeah glides are another one I love, kinda agree on the experimental thing as well - to a point experimenting is fine but eventually it just takes out all the rhythm and actual enjoyability of a song"
3072,2020-08-04 05:08:08,i39v2u,"lmao true true you wanna lmk how you feel bout this track?

[𝟑𝟒𝟓 - 𝐁𝐓𝐎𝐃 [𝐅𝐭. 𝐉𝐎𝐙𝐈𝐄 𝐇𝐀𝐙𝐄 x 𝐎𝐆𝐓𝐇𝐀𝐌𝐀𝐍𝐄]](https://soundcloud.com/badtripoverdose/345-btod-ft-jozie-haze-x-ogthamane)"
3073,2020-08-04 18:20:18,i39v2u,"Yeah for sure. Regarding the experimentation part: I look at it and say if you want hip-hop to be another genre altogether, then you might as well look into how to produce that genre instead. Otherwise don't be surprised when nobody really likes that beat because you're labeling it as a trap beat but it sounds like heavy metal."
3074,2020-08-04 05:13:29,i39v2u,"That’s pretty hot I was nodding the whole time. 

Vocals sound super good, especially on the hook. Honestly nothing I would change with the best. I think the only thing I noticed was the last feature’s vocals didn’t sound quite as good as the rest, a little messy or something."
3075,2020-08-04 05:21:24,i39v2u,yeah i tried mixin them as good as i could to match mine and jozie's vox volume and clarity but AYYYE that's wassup breh i'm glad you fw it fr fr 💪🤘😤
3076,2020-08-04 15:34:43,i39v2u,"I'm not saying the beat is necessarily bad, hell Rodeo is one of the best beats I've ever heard, it's just for me it takes a lot of momentum out if someone's rapping over it. I'll happily do it in the instrumental outro tho."

3120,2020-09-05 01:45:33,imocal,He had close to no promotion with one single. I would call myself a Jaden fan and I barely knew about an album coming out.
3121,2020-09-05 18:40:37,imocal,"Didn’t even know he dropped an album lol, I saw the song on YouTube but that was it lol."
3122,2020-09-04 21:37:46,imocal,"sean i think could put up something in the 100k ballpark, maybe

tekashi i have no idea honestly. total wild card. he'll debut high for sure but i dont think he's gonna pass sean tbh. YAYA and PUNANI both flopped hard as singles and everyone forgot bout TROLLZ 2 seconds after it fell down the charts"
3123,2020-09-04 21:48:49,imocal,"Sean 120k, 6ix9ine 80k and idk who ozuna is aside from him(?) being Spanish so I have no clue"
3124,2020-09-05 04:17:10,imocal,"Don't know anything about Ozuna. Sean's last two albums were very close to each other numbers wise, averaging around 160k first week. But despite a lot of high profile features this album wasn't preceded by a big single and I don't think Big Sean has done enough to keep his buzz up since his last album in 2017 so I'm going to say 100 -120k. 6ix9ine is a bit harder to predict because although his streaming numbers have been relatively unimpressive since his release, his music vids rack up a massive amount of views which do count towards album sales as far as I know. All-things-considered, I predict he'll do between 115-135k; I just don't see him quite cracking the 150k mark even with all the controversy since he hasn't been able to make any of his singles really stick on the charts since his release and he's blackballed from all the major playlists."
3125,2020-09-05 17:55:03,imocal,"Ozuna probably around 20k, Maluma did around that and they're similar in levels of popularity here, but he's gonna do numbers in Latin America."

3131,2020-09-04 22:21:57,imocal,they probably sold more in the uk than these other artists
3132,2020-09-04 23:49:33,imocal,he always sold around 20-25k range
3133,2020-09-05 00:28:21,imocal,he's more known as a general celeb and will smiths kid than really having a fanbase for his music. He has 10+ mil followers on ig so relative to his fame it's kinda low but his music has never been that popular
3134,2020-09-04 22:45:29,imocal,Travis has 500k from Astroworld this year?!?!? Even two years later the album is relevant

\- Young Thug

3151,2020-09-05 07:36:20,imocal,"ozuna is one of the superstars of latin trap. for reference, bad bunny's most recent album broke ozuna's record of most streamed latin album ever in its first week (although bad bunny CRUSHED that record, he's def head and shoulders above the rest at this point)

it wont sell more than sean or tekashi in america but it should chart in the top 10 qat least"
3152,2020-09-05 04:20:17,imocal,lmao you gotta be delusional to think 6ix9ine is only going to do 35k. His lead music video released with the album already racked up 17 million views on youtube. Realistic range is 100-150k.
3153,2020-09-04 23:45:57,imocal,i decided was pretty big w the singles and all and only sold 151k so idt sean would do 200k

3157,2020-09-05 00:33:31,imocal,His last album did 150k so I doubt he’d drop by 100k
3158,2020-09-05 01:42:11,imocal,doubt it but i lowkey dont know if he's surely about to hit 100k+ like everyone saying. I can see him doing around 85k tbh

3195,2020-09-04 22:08:08,imocal,"Deserved, great artist imo"
3196,2020-09-05 01:26:44,imocal,How is he a plant
3197,2020-09-05 05:11:19,imocal,"you're probably downvoted cause ""mumble rap"" is such an outdated word used by eminem stans and oldheads at this pt"
3198,2020-09-05 07:42:19,imocal,">Says dumb shit

""I must have offended **X group of people**"" no you dumb bitch you're just being called a idiot for saying dumb shit 


no offense though since ppl did take your comment wrong but stfu with this ""offended"" stuff"
3199,2020-09-05 03:16:48,imocal,"they started as a youtube producer collective. their most notable member is nick mira, they discovered juice, lil tecca, trevor noah, and a few smaller artists, and have produced a shit ton of hits in the last 2-3 years."
3200,2020-09-06 02:13:49,imocal,The biggest fact.
3201,2020-09-05 04:31:47,imocal,Ya agreed. Wu Tang would definitely be in the running for most influential hip-hop group of the 20th century.
3202,2020-09-05 11:22:35,imocal,"I'd actually put Gucci as number 2 behind Wayne ahead of Kanye. Lyrically nobody has influenced hip-hop more than Gucci, pretty much every rapper since 2012 have just made songs where they copy Gucci lyrics from the mid to late 2000s - bricks, stacks, ice, iced, water, foreign, crock pot, droptop, x on my wrist, x on my neck, forgiato, he rapped about that in most songs he done and then today in 2020 it's common to hear the exact same things still being rapped about and even the same wording. Diamonds being ice or water or dropping the temperature are pretty much Gucci created.

He also has so many songs referencing him and songs and mixtapes about him from other popular rappers....

Free Guwop (Mixtape) - 21 Savage

Free Gucci - 21 Savage

Gucci Mane - Lil Peep

Guwop - Young Thug

Guwop Home - Young Thug

Feel Like Guwop - Ola Runt

Muwop - Mulatto

Plus probably a lot more, thats just ones I could think of quickly.

He has also signed so many popular and producers before they were really known like Young Thug, Migos, Waka Flocka, Hoodrich Pablo Juan plus others like OJ Da Juiceman, Peewee Longway, Ralo, Foogiano, Pooh Shiesty - producers Southside, Lex Luger, TM88.  Also really influential in the careers of Zaytoven, Mike Will Made It, Metro Boomin, Young Scooter, Fetty Wap, Rich Homie Quan and many more.

Thats before you even get into the chains, face tattoo, drugs and behaviour that have been copied and expanded upon.

There is barely a single rapper who came out since 2010 who isnt like Wayne, Gucci or a mix of both but theres many who don't really have anything in common with Kanye."
3203,2020-09-06 02:15:04,imocal,Nah Chief Keef for sure. When you have a 16 yr old come out and have people like Ye and other Goats claiming HIM as inspiration is something on another level.
3204,2020-09-06 03:58:46,imocal,Bet gold on he breaks 150k?
3205,2020-09-04 22:14:34,imocal,"Just wait, I’ll be correct.


If I’m wrong tho just pretend like I didn’t even predict anything and don’t hmu"
3206,2020-09-05 08:09:36,imocal,Because his audience is more on YouTube. He's always has been the strongest when it's about the visuals. And he has a huge worldwide base.
3207,2020-09-05 15:37:08,imocal,I thought merch bundles didn't count for sales now?
3208,2020-09-08 18:55:25,imocal,Yep I'll hold this L (although when I made the comment I was assuming the bundles would count like they did for previous artists).

3210,2020-09-05 00:20:58,imocal,All of the gooba merch included a copy of the album
3211,2020-09-04 23:53:57,imocal,"yeah but they still counts towards album sales, all of those songs are still in same album on Spotify and that's what matter"
3212,2020-09-05 07:15:52,imocal,"Ok pedant. I can’t call him the best rapper cuz that’d be stupid, I even put the mumble in quotes for you slowpokes"
3213,2020-09-05 08:07:11,imocal,Uzi fan spotted
3214,2020-09-05 17:14:36,imocal,"True, I think Gucc influenced waaaaayy more people than Kanye (especially as far as getting them started... Gucci has made stars out of so many people it’s crazy)"
3215,2020-09-06 04:13:11,imocal,"He’s a legend no doubt, but when you go under the hood, Gucci Mane actually helped influence Keef and showed him how to build a platform in the industry.

The amount of platinum super stars that guwop helped kickstart is just insane."
3216,2020-09-06 06:36:59,imocal,You got a deal if he breaks 150k I'll gild what im replying to if he does under 150k you gotta gild this reply good luck
3217,2020-09-04 23:15:37,imocal,His last album was 66k. No way he'll jump to 224k.
3218,2020-09-05 09:32:43,imocal,He is huge in the Latin market which is heavily on youtube. But only streams in America count for Billboard so I don't think he's gonna do well in the charts.
3219,2020-09-05 20:25:26,imocal,I think it’s only ticket bundles that don’t count for sales
3220,2020-09-05 01:25:37,imocal,Those don't contribute to first week sales unless they're purchased within the first week. Those will contribute to its gold/platinum/etc certifications.
3221,2020-09-05 07:18:01,imocal,I was js bruh calm down I dont not agree with you
3222,2020-09-05 09:43:33,imocal,Dusty pretentious Eminem fan detected
3223,2020-09-05 08:20:44,imocal,not a fan but k
3224,2020-09-06 04:25:41,imocal,"I mean...maybe to some extent. But Gucci didnt show keef anything from the rip. He did everything on his own. Maybe I’m wrong but keef has never said that Gucci showed him the way. Influenced? Sure. But a kid literally came in and fucked the game up. You can pinpoint plenty of his songs that ended up being entire lanes for future rappers. He could have stuck to a certain sound and called it a day. Did he? Nah he kept innovating and pushing forward. Keef deserves all the respect and I will die on that hill. Obligatory, if I catch another mother fucker talking sweet bout Chief keef I’m fucking beating their ass."

3227,2020-09-04 23:36:32,imocal,"It was leaked a week before and lost half the streams due to being released midweek. Plus he didn't release a video with it. 

I don't think he'll jump that high but you certainly can't make conclusions based off the last album"
3228,2020-09-04 23:49:32,imocal,"he has a ton of sales from when gooba came out from bundles, every single he dropped he sold albums with it"
3229,2020-09-05 11:31:13,imocal,That's always been his problem. It's crazy how big he's here in Europe.
3230,2020-09-05 07:45:47,imocal,"I’m calm, just making a point"
3231,2020-09-12 03:02:10,imocal,Unfair cause bundles didnt count. They really fucked him over cause i was gonna be right with him doing 150k :(
3232,2020-09-04 23:45:21,imocal,"if he has bundles then i can see his numbers being huge but idk a single person who liked that album. i thought his first 2 albums were much better i dont see this album doing well w streaming 

maybe ive just been super lowkey lately but i didnt know he even dropped an album until this morning"
3233,2020-09-16 03:37:04,imocal,how does it feel to have an opinion that is worse than literal junkpile of dead puppies
3234,2020-09-05 00:42:35,imocal,Well I mean he only dropped it last night...ain't like it's been out for weeks.
3235,2020-09-05 00:56:13,imocal,yea but its 69 his promotion and marketing is always crazy but I swear whenever I look him up on ig his accounts deactivated or something
3236,2020-09-04 12:50:24,ime6m6,"I used to run in to Brent Hinds all the time at this little mexican joint with killer burritos, I think he lives behind it? I remember the first time I saw him I nudged my buddy and was like that dude has some sweet face tattoos and my friend was like ""dude, thats Brent Hinds from Mastodon"" ummmm holy shit!"
3237,2020-09-04 13:31:39,ime6m6,"Great post, Mastodon are easily top 5 for me."

Anywho, upvoted. I'm not a diehard fan but I can confirm oblivion is a monstrous jam."

Oh, and great write up as always!"
3242,2020-09-04 17:18:55,ime6m6,To me they are one of the few bands to successfully change their sound. Like of course their older stuff is better but their new album are still really quality and still have that “Mastodon” sound
3243,2020-09-04 21:23:25,ime6m6,"First of all, definitely need to include [this live performance](https://youtu.be/DEVSPWOnyeQ)

Also, I think their lack of a “lead” vocalist or frontman is what sets them apart from other bands. All three singers have their own distinct sound they bring to the band. It’s what’s helped them grow and add new flavors to the “Mastodon” sound.

Loved the write up though. I can tell you’re a true fan"
3244,2020-09-04 22:50:32,ime6m6,QotSA and Mastodon are my two favourite bands <3
3245,2020-09-04 12:31:33,ime6m6,"Love this band, and your energy. 

Also, how dare you forget to mention Scott Kelly?!"
3246,2020-09-04 14:13:39,ime6m6,My second favourite modern metal band (behind only Gojira). So damn good
3247,2020-09-04 15:46:37,ime6m6,Great write up! Have to say I was a little disappointed in your EoS divided fan base reference (but yes gave me a chuckle). Do you really think it’s divisive and why? It’s my favorite Mastodon Album
3248,2020-09-04 20:04:31,ime6m6,Their music video for Deathbound may be one of my favorites of all time
3249,2020-09-04 20:39:44,ime6m6,Once more round the sun is an all time album for me.
3250,2020-09-04 20:47:45,ime6m6,"Cold Dark Place is also worth a mention, really cool amalgamation of all their sounds..."
3251,2020-09-04 16:19:51,ime6m6,I have a bunch of signed Mastodon stuff. Nice
3252,2020-09-05 20:45:41,ime6m6,We should do PJ Harvey for one of the next bands of the week. Her record Rid of Me is incredibly heavy and QOTSA-esque. Not to mention her contributions to the desert sessions!
3253,2020-09-10 18:38:36,ime6m6,The growing list of BOTW is looking legit as fuck. Well done.
3254,2020-09-05 01:10:08,ime6m6,"Ironically, Killer Burritos sounds like either a Mastodon side project or the theme of their next video."
3255,2020-09-06 17:10:20,ime6m6,"I went to see them at the Masquerade in like 2006 back when I lived in Atlanta. My buddy and I cabbed it over there. Our cab pulls up to the venue and as we open the door Brent is right there, like leaning into the cab as we slide the door open. I'm like holy shit, Brent!!! He just goes ""I thought you were my mom"" and walked off. He was clearly fucked up. At the show there was a group of older gals drinking off to the side of the stage. Towards the end of the show, Brent calls out his mom from the group, introduced her and said it was her birthday. I think everyone sang happy birthday (I was fucking bent at this point so it's hazy) and then she hung out on the stage while they played Mother Puncher. It was an awesome, trippy show.

Edit: Coxasaurus, what Mexican place, If you don't mind my asking?"
3256,2020-09-04 14:35:51,ime6m6,The picture of Ozzy on a mammoth is just him showing up at Ozzfest in 2005.

3259,2020-09-06 19:34:59,ime6m6,Elmyr in Little 5 Points. Get the burritos and margaritas
3260,2020-09-04 04:49:31,im9m7k,"He will, and probably nobody else for a long time, will ever match the success of *Old Town Road*. It was a once in a generation cultural phenomenon and holding him forever to that standard will only make him bound to fail. If he can score another hit that's able to set itself apart from the OTR/7 era then, no, he won't be considered a one hit wonder."
3261,2020-09-04 04:48:49,im9m7k,Stan Twitter will label him a one hit wonder just to troll but it seems like he has a solid fan base so he will definitely have more hits in the future.
3262,2020-09-04 04:57:56,im9m7k,"Yes, he is obviously a one hit wonder. Most people knew that the second Old Town Road started getting big. Of course there is a chance for another hit, like with any one hit wonder, but I seriously doubt it with him unfortunately."
3263,2020-09-04 05:06:48,im9m7k,"I mean, people probably would have guessed Cardi was going to be a one hit wonder with Bodak Yellow, for basically the same reason as they think Lil Nas X will be now, and she's still dominating the charts.

I don't think it's out of the question that he could score another big hit. It doesn't have to be another Old Town Road to keep his momentum going."
3264,2020-09-04 05:06:36,im9m7k,In the streaming era it's much harder to truly be a one hit wonder. I think he'll have some moderate hits and hopefully cultivate a loyal fanbase.
3265,2020-09-04 05:09:55,im9m7k,"I feel like Old Town Road was such a niche song that he would most likely have to go with that country style in order to succeed further, although anything is possible I guess. He seems
like a good guy so hopefully he can churn out more hits, but it seems unlikely."
3266,2020-09-04 05:33:28,im9m7k,"yeah, for sure... but hopefully he is laughing all the way to the bank, so he stays unbothered"

3268,2020-09-04 05:40:41,im9m7k,"I might just be a pedantic asshole but I feel like he already isn't a one hit wonder? Obviously Panini didn't reach the heights that Old Town Road did but I would still call it a hit. It peaked at #5 (stayed in the top ten for 9 weeks) and was certified quadruple Platinum. This is also anecdotal evidence but I heard the song outside plenty of times, on the radio, with friends, even at a graduation party. It wasn't just a song that came and went after debuting at #60 or something, it was a pretty solid song.

I get that a lot of that is simply because it was his first song to come after Old Town Road which obviously gives it a head start but I feel like the success it attained is more than just that. It has over 600 million streams on Spotify when you add in the remix, I don't think it would be fair to say that it's just because of Old Town Road.

Again, I might just be too pedantic but he really doesn't seem like a **one** hit wonder."
3269,2020-09-04 05:17:46,im9m7k,"I agree with some of the Cardi sentiment. I initially thought he’d be similar to Cardi, but now I think since the music industry (especially rap) is still somewhat homophobic, he’ll end up to be more of a niche artist like Troye Sivan. 

I’d love to see him go as big as Cardi, though. He is definitely dedicated to his visuals and is a great pop performer."
3270,2020-09-03 18:56:09,ilvgqf,[HHH Community Playlist #1: '90s G-Funk // Playlist & Discussion Thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/ikz2b4/hhh_community_playlist_1_90s_gfunk_playlist/)
3271,2020-09-03 15:56:08,ilvgqf,"I firmly consider this one of the greatest albums of the 90s. I often refer to it as ""gothic"" hip-hop; various horror themes barked over haunting melodies, with some of the most frightening and cold bars of the decade delivered. Despite all this, I never felt that the album came across as edgy; everything X said was clearly authentic and came from a place of personal darkness and angst.

X really wasn't afraid to show his true self, whether that be the whimpering pup looking for a home or the lunatic Pitbull frothing at the mouth, and I think that this is what gave him a crossover appeal. I didn't have a difficult life, and I certainly was never a gangster, but when X rapped about the demons pulling him apart from the inside, I really connected with it (I was coincidentally later diagnosed with bipolar, which I believe X was also diagnosed with). I was also angry, and frightened, and secretly hoping that one day I could be a better sort of person, and so even though I've never been religious I still felt an empathy for X on tracks like Prayer and The Convo.

I think that this album has aged fantastically well, for the reasons previously mentioned; X never comes across as being needlessly edgy or provocative, and so the album remains a window into the inner conflicts of one of hip-hop's most tortured artists. The production used is so imposing and atmospheric that it doesn't seem to have suffered either; again, it all matches the spirit of the album so well that it just doesn't seem to age in the same way that many albums from the 90s have.

X ruled hip-hop for a long time, and I think that it was really a result of leaning into an image that he projected as time went on. Although I enjoy his following albums, I feel that they are slightly less honest on the whole, especially the post-00s efforts. X successfully marketed himself and backed that up with genuine talent, although I sometimes wonder how much that contributed to his struggles with substance abuse.

I hold out hope that X can still give us something incredible, if he stays on the correct path. I would personally love to hear a sequel to this album; a lot of this album covers X's fears that his 'dark side' would win, and as we've seen... It kind of did. I would love to hear an older and sober X return to this subject, exploring where things might have gone wrong and what he learned from it. With the current trend of benzo glorification in hip-hop, I think that X could be a very powerful voice of concern and education if he's in the right mindset.

I think that X's reputation in hip-hop has been tarnished by his various struggles with the law and substance abuse. Unfortunately, many younger people know him as the guy who did that Rick and Morty song, and the guy that's always in prison. Regardless, anyone who was into hip-hop at the turn of the millennium can attest to what a force of nature the man was, and I think he'll always have a degree of reverence from the older heads out there."
3272,2020-09-03 16:26:04,ilvgqf,"I just listened to this album during a long car ride like 3 days ago. It hasn’t aged one bit. If it came out today, it would still be just as legit. One of the best intros ever, and it just has the pain and hype levels of X from front to back."
3273,2020-09-03 17:05:03,ilvgqf,"One of the hardest albums i’ve ever had a pleasure listening to. Whenever i’m frustrated or pissed at anything this is my go to material. Sonically it’s awesome, production is top notch, they captured a gritty dark vibe of the east coast, his deep voice and growls sound perfect across those beats, his flow and delivery is ... i think unmatched to this day (i don’t really hear the type of flow X used on this album nowadays). And then the songs... god damn each one is awesome in it’s own way. I still remember the shock i had from hearing the X is coming for you lyrics for the first time. Gruesome. People tend to say Raekwon managed to paint a great picture using only words on Only built for cuban linx. I didn’t get that from him, i got it from X. Personally (and before i get attacked by hhh-ers i will accentuate the word PERSONALLY) this is my favourite album of all time. I understand why some don’t like it, why others don’t consider it a classic but for me it hits home. Originality, production, lyrics, flow, delivery the whole body of work is incredible and unmatched. And the best part? It’s his debut... this is how he came out, fucking swingin’ home runs left and right. Incredible."
3274,2020-09-03 21:31:01,ilvgqf,"[The vinyl anniversary re-release of this album is really cool](https://imgur.com/a/boxc8ei)

They did a really cool job with the gold vinyl and it's one of the nicer ""golds"" Ive seen done for a record. My only gripe is that the sleeve isn't a bi-fold, but I'm not complaining. Flesh of my Flesh also has a really cool blood spatter effect on the discs, but I'll save that for another time. 

Absolutely it's a classic, a *hardcore* classic as it's tone and style won't be for everyone. 

**I think DMX did so well with his first five albums because it was at the right time in the right place,** Eminem's popularity was surging like crazy back then and people were hungry for hardcore offensive shit. It also helped that Nu-Metal at the time created cross-genre appeal and many metalheads and rock fans like me found themselves listening to cross over features on Limp Bizkit albums for example, or even other artists. DMX was huge and successful because he was everywhere at the time and stylistically he was edgy along with Eminem AND catchy. from about 1998 until probably 2004 rap had a MASSIVE cross-over appeal to fans of other genres and that's why albums from Eminem, DMX, Dr Dre, Method Man and etc from back then are so HUGE and a big part of everyone's collective memory from that era. 

DMX fell off because he's dealt with a crippling drug addiction most his life, which lead to bad partnerships, bad songs and just a total lack of motivation later in his career. **How do you stay hungry when your first five albums all go #1 and you've achieved things that probably no other artist in rap's history have done? He was a victim of his own success.**

**I think DMX is an American national treasure and if he manages to stay clean and reformed and partners with some people who wanna see him back on top and aren't out for themselves, he'll do great things again.**

**Do I think DMX has the talent and capability to create a new album that's as good as his first 2 or 3 albums? Yes I absolutely do.** In fact, I'll even say I think he still has some of his best material he's ever done within him, it's just a matter of if he can stay focused and healthy to do it. **One of the biggest tragedies in life is watching talent go to waste. I hope he's come to the that realization.**

Nas just put out an incredible album with Hit-Boy. **Do I think there are producers out there who could create an *incredible* modern styled album with DMX? Yes, I do.**

**DMX's comeback and success all depend on him**. Some of the greatest people and artists in history though are often savants and victims of themselves. DMX is an example of this, but I don't think it's too late for him to turn it around and release something mind-blowing. He's *that* good and talented, *even still.* I should also point out that yes, he does appear to be on the straight and narrow, *for now,* I just hope he keeps at it. 

DMX, the world needs you and **we're all still big fans that wanna see you be successful and release some god-tier shit.**"
3275,2020-09-03 16:38:01,ilvgqf,"Favorite album of all time, I've done countless write ups on other accounts about this album, and other subsequent DMX albums.  Flesh Of My Flesh, Blood Of My Blood is amazing as well, but this album is a debut in every sense of the word. It introduces DMX, and paints a very vivid picture of who this man is. His strengths, his weaknesses, his insecurities, and this grapple he has with himself and his faith in God."
3276,2020-09-03 16:52:13,ilvgqf,"In England I got hold of a bootleg of hot 97 'Dmx, Nore, Canibus' - I felt sorry for Nore, I liked his swagger but he didn't seem in the same league as Dmx and canibus.  I bought 'its dark' on the back of hearing the hot 97 set.  Great lp, still sounds fresh and so many great beats.  Classic for me."
3277,2020-09-03 17:27:58,ilvgqf,"DMX really has one of the most under-appreciated cadences/deliveries of all time. Lyrics complex and emotional enough to provoke thought and connection, but simple enough to reach a global audience. His delivery is so unique and has yet to be matched since. I don’t think there’s ever been a rapper able to be more honest in his lyrics on a consistent basis without fear."
3278,2020-09-03 16:37:33,ilvgqf,"Imo the best hip-hip record of 1998 and very deserving of being called a classic. I can only think of a handful albums imo that match up to the same level of darkness. The title and dark red cover give you a perfect idea of what you’re about to get into, the atmosphere is aggressive, ominous, and at some points transparent and vulnerable (I.E. Damien, The Convo, Look Thru My Eyes)

Not only that, but this is his best produced album. I’m not the biggest fan of Swizz Beats’ sound all over Flesh of My Flesh and whatnot. I can’t help but wonder where X’s career would’ve went had he not released his three best albums within a two year span (his other various problems notwithstanding)."
3279,2020-09-03 16:55:12,ilvgqf,"Might be the fact that This was the biggest album during my high school years, or that Ruff Ryders/Cash Money was the first concert I ever went to, first time I ever smoked a blunt, had a chick twerk on me at, but this album and DMX in general will always be one of my favorites. He was completely different than the rest of hip hop at the time. There was a legitimate argument whether he or Jigga were the king of New York in 98."
3280,2020-09-03 17:05:23,ilvgqf,"I remember when this album came out.  As OP said, this album came out during ""the shiny suit era."" Rap/hip hop at the time felt very pop influenced. 

This album hit like a ton of bricks.  It felt/was aggressive, gritty and was an otherwise departure from the current sound (at least to the hip hop I was exposed to at the time).  I get nostalgic listening to the intro. It is so good.  

I ended up giving my CD to the girl I had a crush on who was moving out of the country.


Edit: answering OP's questions.  It's a shame what happened to DMX later in his career.  I think this album kicked off a huge run for him and the Ruff Ryders.  I definitely think he fell off later in his career but not sure how much of that is attributed to his drug/legal problems.  I think if he kept up with consistent album releases, he could have been one of the goats."
3281,2020-09-03 18:28:37,ilvgqf,"A classic and one of my top 10 favorite rap albums ever. While I enjoyed the shiny suit rap, X’s gritty street style was needed to bring some balance back to the game. Dude’s flow, delivery, and cadence was so unique and memorable, his verses just stuck with you. He was highly underrated as a lyricist back then too, he wasn’t on a Nas or Jay level but he was much better than he got credit for. Swizz, Irv, and Dame Grease blessed him on here and unfortunately he never got that quality of production for a whole project again. My favorite rappers at the time right before this album were Nas, Biggie, and Mase but mannn, X put himself right up there after this. I thought his reign as one of the top MCs was going to last much longer, sucks his demons were so strong."
3282,2020-09-03 18:36:40,ilvgqf,"• It’s one of my favourite albums ever, so hell yeah it’s deserving of its classic status  
• I’d say it aged pretty well, tho to be fair, I wasn’t even alive when this came out, so I missed most of the development of hip hop  
• Almost every artist falls off at some point, unfortunately it can happen to the best, so I’m afraid it was inevitable  
• I wouldn’t consider DMX as GOAT status, but It’s Dark and Hell is Hot definitely is deserving of a GOAT album title"
3283,2020-09-03 21:46:10,ilvgqf,"Listened to this album to death since it came out.

I actually met X once in Toronto when he was in town filming Romeo Must Die(i think this was like 2000). I was working with this photographer as an assistant doing a shoot at this nice hotel that X was staying at downtown. 

We were coming out of the hotel garage when my boss had to stop to look for directions. All of a sudden this Cadillac SUV with tinted windows started honking at us from behind and this guy sticks his head out (DMX) yelling for us to ""MOVE THE FUCKING CAR"". We didn't know yet that this was DMX. Just thought it was some crazy road rage guy behind us. My boss yelled back at him to relax and the guy jumped out the car LITERALLY BARKING AT US WITH EXPLETIVES. I was like yo this guy is gonna road rage on us hard let's go quick. So we drove off and bounced fast lol 

Later on we headed back to the hotel for the second part of our shoot and I spotted the guy that was yelling at us earlier with an entourage. I was like oh shit he looks familiar could it be.... Then before i could even think about it for a quick second i saw ""DMX"" on the back of his jacket! I WAS LIKE WTF ! I tell my boss that the guy yelling at us earlier is a famous rapper but he doesn't listen to hiphop so he was just like oh that's kinda cool. I'm star-struck but at the same time DMX was about to pull up on us earlier so i was kinda worried if he was gonna recognize us from earlier lol 

Anyways my boss was like he needed to go to the bathroom so we headed to the washroom down the hall. He passes me his camera which was like one of those huge medium format ones with a huge flash on it. Literally looked like a paparazzi kinda camera and asked me to hold on to it while he goes inside the washroom. I'm like waiting and texting ppl that i just ran into DMX freaking out(still star-struck) when all of sudden DMX WALKS RIGHT BY ME AND GOES INTO THE WASHROOM. I'm like oh shit what do i do?! Is my boss gonna get a beat down when DMX realizes the encounter earlier??! So i wasn't sure what what to do. So i burst into the washroom lol tripping all over myself. Both my boss and DMX were at the urinal. DMX looks at me and this big ass camera and was like ""DAWG NO PHOTOS! LET A MAN PISS IN PEACE! F*CK""  then i was like no no no we are here doing a shoot upstairs,  we not paparazzi. I was expecting a beat down then for sure. However DMX washed his hands and was like the friendliest guy I ever met. We dapped and talked for about 10 mins and we got photos with him too. Told us he is in town shooting a movie and he had the night off was about to go play pool/billiards. He also had a small black case with his personal cue stick that looked mad expensive. Anyways we told him that was us earlier and we squashed that beef right there. Oh and i told him how much of a classic It's Dark and Hell is Hot is to me. Mad respect to DMX."
3284,2020-09-03 19:46:28,ilvgqf,"1. It definitely deserves to be called a classic. Great album front to back imo, even more so considering it's his debut.
2. It aged very well imo. Production still fire, as are Xs bars.
3. idk, but probably because of his work ethic at the time. Two albums in 98 alone, and 5 in the span of 6 years, all of them quality. Definitely not a fluke imo. Dude is a great rapper.
4. Idk, hard to say whether his fall off was inevitable. I believe if it weren't for the drug addiction he'd def be more of a staple than he is now. Whether with the same quality or less so, he'd be like the other 90s rappers (Nas, Snoop, etc), and OG that still releases music. Sadly, with his addiction and incarcerations he fell a bit off the map and it feels like sometimes ppl forget about him and how huge he was end of the 90s/early 00s
5. Not a what-if imo, as he released enough dope albums in his prime. But I feel him falling off the map because of his problems made people forget about him a bit, at least it feels like it. So his legacy may be a bit underrated today. Dude is definitely one of the greats imo. Insane talent plus a perfect voice and delivery for hardcore street raps."
3285,2020-09-03 20:07:28,ilvgqf,One of my top three albums of all time along with MMLP and Tha Carter II
3286,2020-09-03 23:39:14,ilvgqf,One of the greatest album titles ever in any genre in my opinion
3287,2020-09-04 03:29:17,ilvgqf,"From the intro to the outro, he kills every song..."
3288,2020-09-04 06:20:07,ilvgqf,"Man, I was watching a couple of episodes of that Ruff Riders docuseries the other day and it made me sad to see the way that everyone treats DMX. Ruff Ryder's would never have been shit if not for this album, and this album is one of, if not the most personal album of its era and yet it still bangs.

There was a subtle thread throughout the EPS I watched wherein everytime they talked about a DMX hit they would interview someone who would tell some convoluted story about how they're the real reason that the song became a hit. It's like they all want you to believe that DMX wouldn't be shit without them.

No wonder the guy is such a hot mess. It feels like literally no one has ever really had his back."
3289,2020-09-04 07:38:11,ilvgqf,Excellent writing
3290,2020-09-04 07:40:44,ilvgqf,Nice fucking right up man
3291,2020-09-04 10:45:43,ilvgqf,"It’s most definitely a classic. The album was absolutely immense at the time, I remember seeing the CD cover absolutely everywhere.  I’ve played quite  a bit of DMX lately and I am surprised how well it has aged. DMX has never really fit into any category and, despite 5 number 1 albums and huge sales has always felt like an outsider. That, coupled with his raw, tortured energy had a truly universal appeal. Really great write up, thank you."
3292,2020-09-04 11:33:01,ilvgqf,"People don’t realise the depth that DMX had which is sad. I had to spin my friend on this album recently because all he knew DMX for was his club bangers. This is one of the albums that bridged the gap for me getting into the horrorcore style of hip hop. 

Ruff Ryders anthem is an all time great beat. Damien is an incredible storytelling song probably my favourite DMX song (between that and The Rain). Great write up man I hope it exposes people more to DMX and his album tracks."
3293,2020-09-04 11:51:45,ilvgqf,I enjoy these write ups a lot! Good shit!
3294,2020-09-04 12:03:17,ilvgqf,"I revisited this album quite a lot over the summer and it made me realise how much I love this album and hate Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood because I felt the quality of the beats dropped in the follow up. 

I definitely think the last track, N——z Done Started Something, is the perfect track to end the album because it feels so bittersweet thanks to the Marvin Gaye sample Dame Grease used; and after pouring his heart out in The Convo, he’s still DMX in the end. Also, the last ten seconds or so seems to loop nicely back to the intro because it’s just Dame Grease and DMX again."
3295,2020-09-04 04:29:09,ilvgqf,My favorite album ever.
3296,2020-09-04 12:55:49,ilvgqf,My first album. Takes me back. Good times man.

3298,2020-09-03 17:27:32,ilvgqf,"> (i don’t really hear the type of flow X used on this album nowadays).

Denzel Curry kind of uses X's flow briefly on his [Diet_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scsUaLWex70) song at around the 0:38 timestamp.  But yeah, I think you have a point, I don't think I see many rappers using the DMX flow.

Edit:  DMX flow also used in:

A$AP Rocky - [Praise The Lord (Da Shine) ft. Skepta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kbj2Zss-5GY)"

And i understand them, it needs a certain confidence and hardness (or maybe roughness/ruffness- pun intended) to pull it off

Gen X: 1966-1983: First to enter high school after Star Wars and last to graduate high school before 9/11

Millennials: 1984-2001: First to graduate high school after 9/11 and the last to experience a traditional high school graduation

Gen Z: 2002-2019: First to graduate high school remotely and last to be born before a worldwide pandemic"

3374,2020-09-01 07:21:52,ikfnvk,"If I were to group generations by 18 years it would go like this

Boomer: 1942-1960 (ends at 1960 since they're the last that could possibly remember JFK dying)

Gen X: 1961-1979 (first who can't possibly remember JFK dying to last 70s borns)

Gen Y: 1980-1998 (first 80s borns to last who can possibly remember 9/11)

Gen Z: 1999-2017 (first who can't possibly remember 9/11 to last who can possibly remember pre-COVID 19 world)"
3375,2020-09-01 17:28:39,ikfnvk,"True. Even though I wouldn't argue for this organization of generations, I still liked reading one possible interpretation of how certain years could be grouped together."
3376,2020-09-02 00:03:49,ikfnvk,"I know that, but I actually like this generational grouping. Makes all generations 18-19 years is very balanced, compared to making it very short as 15-16 or less years or making it very long like 21-22+ years. It makes things easier for everyone else instead of all this confusion. But at the same time, this is all arbitrary. I know that we are not really millennials at the end of the day, especially based on how society views millennials and such, but maybe being a millennial is different to another person. Just my two cents."
3377,2020-09-01 07:59:34,ikfnvk,Interesting.
3378,2020-09-10 23:10:09,ikfnvk,What's wrong with that? I was just listing a bunch of celebrities born around that time.
3379,2020-09-01 07:43:39,ikfnvk,"I dont think ""first who cant possibly remember"" or ""last who can possibly remember"" something are good markers to mark a generation. I mean it is very likely a three or four year old would not remember the political importance of these events. They may not even know who this Kennedy is until like years after he died. 1961 might have memories prior to Kennedy's death.  I am sure many 1959 and 1960 borns would not remember Kennedy's death. Many 1995-1998 dont even remember 9/11. 2015-2017 though can end up remembering a world before coronavirus 15 years from now, even though they may not know what coronavirus is.

3380,2020-09-01 07:52:21,ikfnvk,"Not bad. It's just shifted over four years earlier.

Instead of this:
Boomer: 1946-1964
Gen X: 1965-1983
Gen Y: 1984-2002
Gen Z: 2003-2021

It's this:
Boomer: 1942-1960
Gen X: 1961-1979
Gen Y: 1980-1998
Gen Z: 1999-2017"
3381,2020-09-01 07:58:57,ikfnvk,"The 1961-1979 and 1980-1998 definitions aren't that uncommon actually. Many people want to begin gen y at 1980 since it's the first 80s year, so whenever they also apply the 18 year span, it ends up being 1980-1998. You barely ever see 1942-1960 and 1999-2017 though."
3382,2020-09-01 08:09:10,ikfnvk,"I prefer the ranges next to: instead of this rather than its this. Makes no sense for 1960 to be gatekept from the other two early 60s years. You even said 1980 should be start of millennials since it is the first 80s year. First half of the 60s is gen jones anyways. 

I have seen 1945-1959 as a baby boomer definition. 

Then 1960-1979. 

1980-1999 is one of the most agreeable millennial definitions I have come across. It is my favorite actually. 

I am not keen on when Gen Z ends though.

3383,2020-09-01 08:02:57,ikfnvk,"1961-1979 is uncommon. I have seen 1960-1979 though with 1946-1959, and even 1960-1980. 1961-1982 is used by just one source though and that uses 1943-1960. I have seen 1998-2016. Never 1999-2017 though. People would prefer stating X in 1960 if 1964 or 1965 is too late, since the first three years of the 60s are the full early 60s years, just like how you said 1980 should be y as it is the first 80s year. People prefer 1982 over 1980 as the millennial start date though."
3384,2020-09-01 08:01:55,ikfnvk,"First of all, I have never seen 1961-1979 and I seen 1942-1960, with the exception of 1942, so 1943-1960. I have seen 1980-1998 (though I feel that most start Y in 1980 cause it is the first 80s year like ending it in 1994 or 1999 for the same numerical reason. I have seen 1999-2017 in a way, maybe excluding 2017, so 1999-2016."

[https://globalmedia-it.com/USA/millennials-are-not-the-black-sheep-of-generations/](https://globalmedia-it.com/USA/millennials-are-not-the-black-sheep-of-generations/)

It's a definition that will probably never die off, since it begins at 1961 (the second most popular starting point for gen x) and goes all the way to the end of the 70s."

3390,2020-09-01 04:26:06,ikdp8f,It’s literally impossible to be an X clone or copycat whatever u wanna call it

3392,2020-09-01 11:22:55,ikdp8f,idk but i agree i enjoy blue x more nowadays

X community: HES COPYING!"
3394,2020-09-01 06:07:08,ikdp8f,its like X created being humble or sumn 🥱
3395,2020-09-01 18:38:32,ikdp8f,Bro chill. I'm justing asking if anyone knows any rappers who sound have a similar style to those songs. Just like I names some who have a similar style to different x styles.
3396,2020-09-01 04:47:57,ikdp8f,Idk I'm mainly asking if anyone knows any
3397,2020-09-01 04:26:59,ikdp8f,"Yeah bro but it's possible to try an imitate it. I'm talking about people who are trying to copy, not people who are a literal x copy."
3398,2020-09-01 17:54:32,ikdp8f,Yooo wtf he's actually really good. It's crazy how everyone be suggesting shitty artist but this time it was actually a good one.
3399,2020-09-01 08:27:40,ikdp8f,broly and tokyo are definitely not trying to copy and im not 100% sure ab jasiah but kinda doubt he is
3400,2020-09-02 02:42:37,ikdp8f,glad u fw him
3401,2020-09-01 18:42:55,ikdp8f,Dude I'm not trynna argue about who's copying who. You can obviously hear a similarity when x sing and when broly sings. There's an obvious similarity to Tokyo rapping and x/ski style songs. I'm just using them as examples of people who sound similar in some songs. Also heres one song that sounds like the x style I'm talking about https://youtu.be/mgGyWXl4A4k . I'm just asking if anyone knows anymore songs or artists that do that type of sound. I didn't think y'all where gonna get hurt.
3402,2020-09-06 21:53:13,ikdp8f,"u prolly talking about the song “Decide” by ssgkobe, which was influenced by Sad!, but kobe not a copycat he deadass has his own sound"
3403,2020-09-01 18:47:04,ikdp8f,im not hurt im just stating facts. i know theyre similar its just broly almost quit cuz he was being compared to x and tokyo had a huge rant. ill listen to the snippet in a sec
3404,2020-09-06 22:30:18,ikdp8f,"it wasn't that, it's an unreleased song he previewed and ik he does"
3405,2020-09-06 22:31:09,ikdp8f,what it go like (if u dont know the name) cuz im tryna peep

3464,2020-08-29 23:38:35,iiu3ld,Maluma be stay getting Pussy
3465,2020-08-29 23:21:06,iiu3ld,Nas album is wayyyyyy better than what those sells indicate.
3466,2020-08-29 17:29:55,iiu3ld,"Definitely thought blackbear was going to sell more than that. That album was all hits

Also, how did Lecrae do?"
3467,2020-08-29 20:29:56,iiu3ld,nas sold more than 9 smokepurrps!
3468,2020-08-29 23:48:57,iiu3ld,Lame nas’s new album is fire
3469,2020-08-29 18:24:39,iiu3ld,Kings disease is the best hip hop album of the year change my mind
3470,2020-08-29 21:09:32,iiu3ld,post money man's numbers damn.  Dude sold 20K without promotion fuck these 1K rappers
3471,2020-08-29 22:08:11,iiu3ld,Genuinely shocked Blackbear is so low
3472,2020-08-29 23:46:46,iiu3ld,I’m surprised everyone’s surprised blackbear sold so low. He still feels like a Soundcloud artist to me. I still remember listening to him on Koala Control with other Indie Pop/EDM artists. I haven’t heard anything from him since Vicodin in Paris
3473,2020-08-30 01:43:51,iiu3ld,"Damn, Alina Baraz did that bad? No wonder why Pandora tries to stuff her down my throat all the time, she ain’t selling. When she split from Galimatias, she went steadily downhill."
3474,2020-08-30 07:59:15,iiu3ld,Thought Nas would at least match Nasir's numbers (70K) because of no other major album (Jay and B) or death (XXX) but I guess without Kanye's production/promotion it didn't happen.
3475,2020-09-04 00:52:55,iiu3ld,Lol shoutout to Suga/Agust D for ranking w 2 albums lol
3476,2020-08-30 03:04:03,iiu3ld,I thought maluma was one of the biggest latina artists. Why is his numbers this low?
3477,2020-08-30 12:44:55,iiu3ld,Jay Z better
3478,2020-08-29 20:27:41,iiu3ld,Lecrae should be on here. He sat at #2 on the iTunes Hip Hop charts last week and is still at #4.

3480,2020-08-29 17:00:58,iiu3ld,[deleted]
3481,2020-08-29 19:56:57,iiu3ld,I guess Nas won the battle and Jigga won the war
3482,2020-08-29 20:06:18,iiu3ld,Nasir sold more than King’s Disease despite having a better reception and the new school features didn't help.I wonder when old school rappers will understand that you should appeal to your core fanbase instead of trying to appeal to the new school fans.
3483,2020-08-29 17:41:39,iiu3ld,"Why do so many of these guys call themselves, “lil somethin”?"
3484,2020-08-29 16:09:31,iiu3ld,He's like 18 years removed from his classics. Most of us here weren't listening to rap when he was in his prime
3485,2020-08-29 15:56:15,iiu3ld,"I am kinda bummed Nas is going down in terms of popularity, but at the same time, he is 25+ years into his career, way past his commercial peak and still selling decently. In the 2000s to think rappers of his age and from his generation are still kinda relevant would’ve been crazy to think about. I mean, rappers from the 80s weren’t as relevant then as Nas is now."
3486,2020-08-29 17:35:09,iiu3ld,I mean why would you even compare them?
3487,2020-08-29 16:35:59,iiu3ld,Because 15 to 25-year-old girls don't listen to Nas.
3488,2020-08-29 18:17:20,iiu3ld,He has his fan base and he’s already achieved whatever he has to. I don’t think it matters anymore
3489,2020-08-29 23:44:04,iiu3ld,This was independently released. So he's making more off this tbh
3490,2020-08-29 17:11:08,iiu3ld,"i know y'all don't like russ but he sells a decent amount, selling less than russ isn't the huge own that you think it is.

he also sold less than nav lol omg xd"
3491,2020-08-29 23:43:55,iiu3ld,Who honestly listens to Russ bro?
3492,2020-08-29 17:47:14,iiu3ld,Russell makes Pop music. Nas is a rapper. Completely irrelevant.
3493,2020-08-31 09:08:55,iiu3ld,The pure sale numbers between the two really caught my attention
3494,2020-08-29 23:32:31,iiu3ld,Idk dude I thought the production was lacking this time around. I’m a pretty big Nas fan but this one was a disappointment.
3495,2020-08-29 19:24:49,iiu3ld,I'm 30 and grew up with Nas but no way am I getting all hyped over a Nas album nowadays. I still haven't even listened to it. His days are over. Rap is a young man's game.
3496,2020-08-29 16:52:32,iiu3ld,"He did do some weird rollout for the album, releasing in 2 parts. Honestly should of just released the whole thing like 2 months ago"
3497,2020-08-29 16:38:40,iiu3ld,"For sure a singles artist. Dude has 26M monthly listeners and his album still only did this. 

I also think a lot of his albums are the types that kinda grow on you on multiple listens"
3498,2020-08-29 21:46:02,iiu3ld,yeah people are talking about nas's underwhelming numbers but im shocked blacbear sold so little
3499,2020-08-29 19:07:56,iiu3ld,"this is how people act in these threads, no matter who the rapper is, when an artist sell less than like 80k"
3500,2020-08-29 23:45:59,iiu3ld,Don't forget he released this on mass appeal not def jam. Independent albums usually have fewer sales
3501,2020-08-30 06:43:58,iiu3ld,Personally when it comes to artists like Nas I don’t give a flying fuck how many copies it sells. The album is dope and is being celebrated in the hip hop community online / praised by the veterans etc
3502,2020-08-29 16:33:28,iiu3ld,I mean Eminem randomly dropped an album at 9 PM on a Friday and it was near 300k
3503,2020-08-29 20:10:09,iiu3ld,Do you really think he put so many new school artists on the album and not caring about numbers at all?
3504,2020-08-30 03:42:26,iiu3ld,Artists definitely care about their numbers tf
3505,2020-08-29 21:04:57,iiu3ld,"I honestly didn’t even know he had an album dropping, I saw a headline saying a new Nas album on the 21st. Still haven’t listened to it because they didn’t get me hooked with any hype. 🤷🏼‍♂️"
3506,2020-08-29 15:32:49,iiu3ld,"That beat is so dope, simple but effective. Ferg really showed out on it too."
3507,2020-08-29 15:57:10,iiu3ld,Replace Me and All Bad for me.
3508,2020-08-29 17:05:35,iiu3ld,que lo que everybody pricy
3509,2020-08-29 18:17:15,iiu3ld,"replace me, till the war is won, all bad. Complete bangers"
3510,2020-08-30 02:22:16,iiu3ld,People hate Fivio's verse but I just find it so funny that it's good to me lmao
3511,2020-08-29 18:01:48,iiu3ld,"I absolutely love the first 1:12 of the cure but I’m upset Hit Boi switched the beat up, I can’t stop listening to the first part"
3512,2020-08-29 16:21:11,iiu3ld,"How is My Turn outselling Eternal Atake, when Uzi has more streams on Spotify then Baby? Is situation different on Apple music?"
3513,2020-08-29 18:54:50,iiu3ld,Future outselling Eminem with a 5 month disadvantage is pretty impressive
3514,2020-08-29 16:39:33,iiu3ld,[deleted]
3515,2020-08-29 18:15:14,iiu3ld,"Considering how long he's been on this streak, he's gonna need more than one good album to start selling well. Realistically he's pretty much gonna have to re-establish himself as an artist."
3516,2020-08-29 19:16:03,iiu3ld,"i seriously doubt he expected it to chart.

just a surprise dropped ep

not like it's pushing for a hit either"
3517,2020-08-29 19:02:12,iiu3ld,"honestly he had almost close to no promotion for this outside of that Lollapalooza performance so not that surprised, definitely one of his best projects ever though.   
but yeah signing to roc nation definitely derailed his career"
3518,2020-08-29 22:30:47,iiu3ld,"He fucked up his career with the X diss

Edit: why am I being downvoted? Most people know him solely as ""the guy who dissed X"" and he doesn't do numbers anymore"
3519,2020-08-29 19:50:12,iiu3ld,What is burger wrapper
3520,2020-08-29 23:05:08,iiu3ld,yes
3521,2020-08-29 16:33:09,iiu3ld,I was expecting at least 50K
3522,2020-08-29 18:30:21,iiu3ld,Yo Baby does numbers
3523,2020-08-29 18:58:36,iiu3ld,Most likely going Double platinum by December
3524,2020-08-29 23:28:52,iiu3ld,[deleted]
3525,2020-08-29 20:15:25,iiu3ld,That Rolling Stone review was awful
3526,2020-08-29 23:47:11,iiu3ld,Plus he dropped it on mass appeal independently. He isn't on def jam anymore
3527,2020-08-29 18:46:29,iiu3ld,He's always been accused of mildly misogynistic bars throughout a lot of his career tho? Don't get how that stood out
3528,2020-08-30 07:27:11,iiu3ld,"haven't listened to this one yet, how does it compare to other Latin rap releases from this year, like Bad Bunny, Anuel AA, J Balvin, Dalex, Sech and Myke Towers?"
3529,2020-08-29 23:47:35,iiu3ld,The sales are great when you factor that it was an independent drop
3530,2020-08-29 17:49:34,iiu3ld,I’m really surprised to not see Lecrae on here at all
3531,2020-08-30 18:42:07,iiu3ld,Surprised not to see him on the list.  That album was so good.
3532,2020-08-29 19:08:41,iiu3ld,Alfredo & Pray for Paris are better for me but King's Disease is up there
3533,2020-08-29 18:39:07,iiu3ld,I still give the nod to Alfredo
3534,2020-08-29 23:40:05,iiu3ld,There are about 25-30 albums I’d have above it IMO
3535,2020-08-30 02:53:09,iiu3ld,"For me the production isn’t that good from front to back, most of the features aren’t good, and it’s thematically/conceptually boring"
3536,2020-08-30 07:28:53,iiu3ld,"if we're just talking ones in English then maybe, as i haven't been too impressed with many full hip-hop albums so far, but there have been some excellent projects coming out in Spanish"
3537,2020-08-29 23:40:58,iiu3ld,Epidemic came out in March
3538,2020-08-30 02:11:41,iiu3ld,Hot girl bummer is literally one of the biggest songs of the year (like it’s literally number 19th biggest song I’d the year rn)
3539,2020-08-30 06:33:04,iiu3ld,"Honestly I dont know, personally I loved his album, maybe those are only USA numbers?"
3540,2020-08-30 07:40:04,iiu3ld,"i only really got into Latinx music this year, but from what I've seen the US tends to like the singles, but not listen to the full albums much. There are a few exceptions from the very big names, but it seems that in most cases the album's just get straight up ignored"
3541,2020-08-30 13:55:13,iiu3ld,"Streaming is still a growing market in most Latino communities. One can refer to the YouTube platform and see most Latino artists have HUGE numbers on their videos, since that’s what that market tends to use more often"
3542,2020-08-29 16:06:22,iiu3ld,[deleted]
3543,2020-08-29 17:12:34,iiu3ld,I feel like I'm being baited into saying some oldhead shit but I'm resisting the urge.
3544,2020-08-29 17:32:14,iiu3ld,"At this point it doesn’t matter what charisma he has lmao, he’s proven he can do that before and all he needs is the bars, the beat and a subject matter"
3545,2020-08-29 17:38:47,iiu3ld,"Go play some league of legend, hip hop ain’t for you"
3546,2020-08-29 17:55:29,iiu3ld,"Gonna get shit on, but his personality is like a wet blanket."
3547,2020-08-29 22:42:51,iiu3ld,That shit is done ages ago both are established and have their own fanbase and still producing good albums
3548,2020-08-29 22:20:18,iiu3ld,"Won the war by faking 1st week numbers through shady Samsung deals like he's been doing since MGHG? 

Let him release an album without all that bullshit and i doubt he's getting more than 100k first week with promo/50k without."
3549,2020-08-29 20:35:22,iiu3ld,"Well, he also had the promotion of this up and coming artist named Kanye West..."
3550,2020-08-29 18:41:09,iiu3ld,often times they don’t “choose” to call themselves that. a lot of these guys grow up in communities/groups and are nicknamed “lil XYZ” by their peers/friends and then use that as their rap name
3551,2020-08-29 17:53:53,iiu3ld,Are you new to the genre? Lil has bee  used in front of names for 35 or so years now. Think it's time to drop the dumb act and move on.
3552,2020-08-29 18:09:39,iiu3ld,Most of HHH users weren't even born when Nas was in his prime.
3553,2020-08-29 22:31:11,iiu3ld,That sucks
3554,2020-08-29 16:13:35,iiu3ld,Life is Good is a classic.
3555,2020-08-29 23:44:15,iiu3ld,It's also independently released
3556,2020-08-29 16:13:16,iiu3ld,"On top of it, he doesn’t really do much promotion anymore. He just drops albums with only a few weeks of buildup and no singles intended as hits. I feel like “Life Is Good” was the last full-on commercial album of his with several lead singles, promotion, marketing, etc."
3557,2020-08-29 20:08:39,iiu3ld,It sold less than Nasir despite having a better reception.Those numbers are pretty disappointing.
3558,2020-08-29 17:13:00,iiu3ld,"I agree, this is a pretty solid performance for him all things considered.

If there was a conventional rollout, we weren't in a pandemic, and something like ""Nasty"" or ""The Don"" were singles, this would probably sell more."
3559,2020-08-29 19:02:04,iiu3ld,Only real men listen to Nas 😎😎😎😎
3560,2020-08-30 16:15:53,iiu3ld,damn didn't even realize that.
3561,2020-08-29 17:16:28,iiu3ld,"My comparison more so came from the fact that Nas orchestrated his singles well, had a fair amount of hype, best work in a while, while Russ's album was just another random one, not particularly well marketed or received even compared to his last album, it came and went. 


Rather than Nas good, Russ bad 😡😡

Russ with minimal effort, outsold Nas at maximum potential"
3562,2020-08-30 06:50:23,iiu3ld,Probably none of the these dudes will ever sell over 40 million albums worldwide either.
3563,2020-08-29 18:57:10,iiu3ld,"Nas shouldn’t be selling less than Russ, period. No matter what Russ is selling."
3564,2020-08-30 16:19:35,iiu3ld,"a lot of ppl, only 25 rappers have outperformed him this year wrt first week"
3565,2020-08-29 20:16:47,iiu3ld,Russ also is a rapper lol
3566,2020-08-29 21:39:24,iiu3ld,You would rather listen to all those mumble trap rappers lol?
3567,2020-08-29 22:36:25,iiu3ld,Rap is art you listen to these people becaus they are interesting as well and he has evolved his style and i dont know how you cant like this and life is good if you were an that big of a nas fan. Listen to it
3568,2020-08-29 20:20:58,iiu3ld,35 and Nas is my personal goat but I can understand what you are saying. There's something missing from him these days - the lox on the other hand - that new lox hits still like its 98. on repeat all weekend. Lox have aged exceptionally well.
3569,2020-08-29 19:48:25,iiu3ld,"i was pissed when i saw that, i stopped listened to part one mid way when it came out so i could wait for the whole album to come out"
3570,2020-08-29 23:44:36,iiu3ld,Nas released independently
3571,2020-08-29 21:30:51,iiu3ld,People care more about the sales of an album rather than actually listening to the album. I would rather listen to a quality album that sells 10k than some trash album that sells 100k.
3572,2020-08-29 19:10:18,iiu3ld,"Eminem is way more popular than Nas.

He always has been. Eminem's highest first week is like 1.78M. Nas's is  ~~360k~~ **470k**."
3573,2020-08-29 16:58:41,iiu3ld,"True, but Eminem's pop appeal far surpasses Nas, even if I think Illmatic ranks higher than any of Em's projects.

Em occupies a niche that Nas and a lot of classic artists just don't. Eminem is always going to sell more."
3574,2020-08-29 20:51:34,iiu3ld,Eminem is still the biggest rapper on the planet and probably the biggest in history
3575,2020-08-29 23:45:31,iiu3ld,He released it independently though
3576,2020-08-29 23:45:45,iiu3ld,i think that could have contributed to some of his sales but if he was looking for numbers why not release any of those songs as singles or give more of a warning that he was dropping?
3577,2020-08-30 16:20:52,iiu3ld,bc he wanted to make music w them
3578,2020-08-30 03:49:07,iiu3ld,i really don’t think nas is losing sleep over this especially when he hasn’t had to make music or prove himself for years now
3579,2020-08-29 18:07:35,iiu3ld,"Car 85, Kings Disease, and The Cure, but really the whole album be vibing. Other than angelic Hoodrat it’s probably my favorite album this year"
3580,2020-08-29 18:45:41,iiu3ld,Big Sean was so trash tho lol
3581,2020-08-30 02:46:21,iiu3ld,"It's a weird vibe because everyone's flexing but doing it differently. Nas is rich and a lyrical genius, Fivio will fuck all your bitches and he's not a lyrical genius, Ferg is fly and actually realizes he's on a song with Nas so he should probably at least try."
3582,2020-08-29 19:18:10,iiu3ld,I listen to The Cure specifically for the second beat
3583,2020-08-29 18:03:01,iiu3ld,I like the second half beat more but they could've given the first beat at least half the song instead of about 1/4 of it
3584,2020-08-29 16:58:28,iiu3ld,"The numbers you can see on Spotify are Global, this album units are US only.

But still you are correct about Apple Music. I will be talking US only.

First week **37%** of the total streams of 'Eternal Atake' were from Spotify US. 

First week **22%** of the total streams of 'My Turn' were from Spotify US.

So you can see Uzi is a bit more Spotify centered than Baby.

Note: Honestly the ""standard"" Spotify percentage for hip-hop artists is 40%-45%. Now since Jan 2020 (YouTube counts aswell) so it can be down to 35% for artists that do well on YouTube. But still 22% is unheard of.

Pop Smoke first week had 25% of streams coming from Spotify US. Another artist that smashes on Apple Music.

Back to the point: You can check details about each album how many pure sales /audio streams/video streams they have. [Link](https://hitsdailydouble.com/ytd_project_activity)

Uzi has 2.16B Audio streams, Lil Baby has 2.28B Audio streams. This difference is small.

Uzi has 156M Video streams, Lil Baby has 528M Video streams. This is the difference maker. Also Baby has 200K more songs sold."
3585,2020-08-29 21:26:41,iiu3ld,Lil Baby is the king of AM while Uzi only outperforms Baby on Spotify by a good margin but he doesn't dominate him.
3586,2020-08-29 21:49:42,iiu3ld,life is good is one of the biggest songs of the year
3587,2020-08-30 07:19:58,iiu3ld,"it's even more impressive given that it is nowhere near the quality of previous Future releases. If this was to the same standard as Monster, Purple Reign, DS2 etc then i would expect these numbers or higher, but as it is, there's a small handful of good songs and 1 hit single. i honestly think he really dropped the ball on this one"
3588,2020-08-29 16:45:09,iiu3ld,"looks like it's by 200k, unless I'm missing something"
3589,2020-08-30 00:08:46,iiu3ld,He’s corny af so a rebrand before trying to establish himself again may do him some good.
3590,2020-08-29 19:29:46,iiu3ld,">signing to roc nation definitely derailed his career 

And he loves to bring it up, for some reason"
3591,2020-08-29 20:26:25,iiu3ld,It’s an RIAA certification similar to going Gold or Platinum
3592,2020-08-29 18:43:05,iiu3ld,"He literally can’t miss rn

Easily the best out of all the new rappers"
3593,2020-08-30 01:58:18,iiu3ld,Cheeks
3594,2020-08-29 19:11:03,iiu3ld,"I wouldn't say he has been accused bc nobody really cared

Stands out now because it's now. Rappers who previously have said homophobic stuff avoid doing that shit now, and when they do it's noticeable (see: Rick Ross's faggot line on Meek's last album).

People have been more cognizant of misogyny following the #MeToo movement. Specifically, it has brought more attention to the two allegations of domestic abuse against Nas by Kelis and Carmen Bryan.

That being said misogyny is far more accepted in hip hop now than homophobia is."
3595,2020-08-30 13:53:14,iiu3ld,"To put in the relatable terms, Maluma is like the Justin Timberlake of Reggaetón. He has more of a sensual and sexy style the both the women and men like."
3596,2020-08-30 16:58:16,iiu3ld,The man makes quality music what more can I say
3597,2020-08-29 23:51:08,iiu3ld,That’s fair. I just thought it was a great album that more people should have heard.
3598,2020-08-29 20:44:22,iiu3ld,Even when Lecrae sold 88K with Anomaly they still didn't add him to the list on here a few years ago. They never pay attention to him here even though he outsells most of the artists on here.
3599,2020-08-30 18:42:31,iiu3ld,I'm gonna give these both a good listen and see how I feel. Thanks for the rec dude
3600,2020-08-30 18:42:08,iiu3ld,"Thanks for the reply, I listened to alfredo yesterday in my car because of it. I like it so far but I'll listen more before I give a full opinion"
3601,2020-08-30 17:39:31,iiu3ld,"does the deluxe count as a new album?  Idk cause it was 12 new tracks that streamed 20K this week.  Either way, isnt this list for the whole year?"
3602,2020-08-30 21:48:45,iiu3ld,Yes this are only USA numbers
3603,2020-08-30 07:57:09,iiu3ld,"It's true. 

My reggaeton playlist is 100+ songs but I've never listened to an album front to back."
3604,2020-08-29 20:24:17,iiu3ld,It’s surprising to me because I thought Skies had the same reach as someone like Smokepurpp
3605,2020-08-29 16:47:31,iiu3ld,"if that rapper is considered one of the best of all time, no one"
3606,2020-08-29 17:54:57,iiu3ld,"Because he doesn't agree with it?

r/gatekeeping"
3607,2020-08-29 20:19:34,iiu3ld,An actual answer. Thank you.
3608,2020-08-29 19:52:57,iiu3ld,"People were making fun of the ""Lil"" thing even back in the the early 2000s. Saying the same shit people are saying today. Lil Wayne, lil flip, lil John, lil boosie, lil bow wow, etc.

It's always been around and there's ALWAYS some nerd trying to make a joke out of it."
3609,2020-08-29 19:32:28,iiu3ld,"I was here when it started.  “Am I new” 😆
You’re cute, “brah”."
3610,2020-08-30 13:05:58,iiu3ld,"Excuse me, I’ll have you know I was 1 when Illmatic dropped and I still remember the streets going crazy."
3611,2020-08-29 19:33:58,iiu3ld,"I'm old enough to remember the prime Nas days. Speaking from my own personal opinion, Illmatic was his only truly great album. The rest ranged from bad to good-ish. Most of them being meh. He never reached the level he did with illmatic ever again. Guy always had a problem with beat selection and flow. So even 15 years ago his albums weren't really worth getting that hyped over. I'm definitely not going to be hyped about it nowadays. As I said above, rap is a young man's game and Nas had his time."
3612,2020-08-29 16:53:30,iiu3ld,It’s really good but I wouldn’t call it a classic. It was more of a return to form in a great way if anything.
3613,2020-08-29 16:46:09,iiu3ld,"If you want to completely devalue the meaning of the word ""classic"" then sure, Life is Good is a classic. I definitely wouldn't consider it one myself, I think there has to be a certain level of cultural significance in order for an album to be a true classic. Not saying that it isn't a great album, I just think the bar is higher than that alone. In the 2010s, albums like GKMC, 2014 FHD, DS2, and Take Care are classic level because they were great albums that also had a significant cultural impact through their popularity and influence on the genre. I dont think Life is Good had that influence, was just a good ass rap album."
3614,2020-08-29 17:11:40,iiu3ld,Defnitiely not
3615,2020-08-29 17:46:39,iiu3ld,Not a chance bruv and i really like that album
3616,2020-08-29 20:33:38,iiu3ld,Summer on Smash did indeed play all Summer.
3617,2020-08-29 22:10:28,iiu3ld,"Life is Good was his last Def Jam album. King's disease is Mass Appeal, which is independent"
3618,2020-08-29 20:43:04,iiu3ld,That was part of a summer of releases so it makes sense it would sell more
3619,2020-08-29 21:02:40,iiu3ld,Nasir sold more because of the Kanye association.
3620,2020-08-29 17:47:21,iiu3ld,"Russ put in the effort necessary to sell more.

You can’t get mad that a 46 year old lyrical rapper doesn’t have as much widespread appeal as a simple college girl crooner"
3621,2020-08-29 17:18:54,iiu3ld,"bc, like i said: russ is popular.

nas did a week long rollout from announcement to release, same thing as russ."
3622,2020-08-29 19:01:40,iiu3ld,Why?
3623,2020-08-29 23:44:43,iiu3ld,The Beatles are a rock band. Nickelback is also a rock band.
3624,2020-08-29 20:46:24,iiu3ld,🙄
3625,2020-08-30 01:23:32,iiu3ld,the choices aren't 90s rapper out of their prime and mumble rappers. There are plenty of younger people who are lyrical and doing interesting things with their sound
3626,2020-08-30 01:24:38,iiu3ld,I feel like so many artists sell barely any because their stupid ass labels pull shit like that.
3627,2020-09-01 04:36:46,iiu3ld,People forget Illmatic took forever to go Platinum.
3628,2020-08-29 19:32:26,iiu3ld,*I Am...* actually did 470k first week believe it or not but your point still stands
3629,2020-08-29 17:19:49,iiu3ld,also people are conditioned to like watching white people do black music.
3630,2020-08-30 23:38:17,iiu3ld,yeah crazy to me i heard he outsold drake last decade.
3631,2020-08-30 16:49:58,iiu3ld,He wanted to work with them to try to appeal to new school fans
3632,2020-08-29 20:36:01,iiu3ld,He usually is.
3633,2020-08-29 20:02:02,iiu3ld,yea i watch anthony fantano
3634,2020-08-29 23:10:18,iiu3ld,Exactly the same for me. That second part is hard as hell.
3635,2020-08-29 17:34:20,iiu3ld,Do we include deluxes? Uzi has close to 40 songs with deluxe and Lil baby has 26.
3636,2020-08-29 18:36:31,iiu3ld,"good stuff mate 👍🏼 quality content, crazy numbers we are seeing from Baby this year

any details or thoughts on why some artists do better on certain platforms? is it like playlist inclusion, age demographic, etc?"
3637,2020-08-29 17:13:55,iiu3ld,Oh yeah I'm actually just gonna go delete my comment real quick bc I'm fucking dumb haha
3638,2020-08-29 19:03:22,iiu3ld,no
3639,2020-08-30 07:23:28,iiu3ld,"I wouldn't say he is the best rapper to pop in the last few years, but he definitely has some of the best numbers"
3640,2020-08-29 19:23:10,iiu3ld,Big no
3641,2020-08-29 21:14:15,iiu3ld,Honestly i like Gunna better. He’s way more versatile.
3642,2020-08-29 20:45:22,iiu3ld,I haven’t been able to find his numbers for restoration I thought he’d do numbers with this one
3643,2021-02-24 02:13:03,iiu3ld,have you listened to them yet
3644,2020-08-30 10:39:45,iiu3ld,"if you're willing, I'd say it's worth it. find an artist you like a lot of individual tracks of and give an album or EP a try. even if the entire project isn't perfect, you'll find a lot of tracks to love outside of the singles

If i can recommend just one, Dalex released an EP called 3am a few months ago, and it's 6 tracks of laid-back, sorta sultry Latin trap and reggaeton goodness"
3645,2020-08-29 20:40:44,iiu3ld,"nah man I know ppl who barely listen to hip hop who fw skies, but they never heard of smokepurpp"
3646,2020-08-29 19:01:01,iiu3ld,"not really, being one of the best/greatest rappers doesn't mean one is mainstream/popular, it all depends on who the audience is each artist is."
3647,2020-08-29 19:16:57,iiu3ld,most of the best rappers of all time aren't the best selling rappers of all time
3648,2020-08-29 17:58:02,iiu3ld,"There’s not liking an artist, then there’s utterly disrespecting an all-timer. Totally ignorant and baiting comment without any desire to try and understand the other side’s opinion. There’s no reason for him to even be here."
3649,2020-08-29 19:41:18,iiu3ld,I don't care.
3650,2020-08-29 20:09:55,iiu3ld,"Ridiculous to hold him to the standard of GOAT album. It was Written, I Am, Stillmatic and Hip Hop is Dead are all great albums.

Edit: No problem throwing Lost Tapes and Gods Son on that list either."
3651,2020-08-29 22:07:13,iiu3ld,Are people seriously underrating It Was Written? I actually prefer this to Illmatic (which was also brilliant and a better “pure” hip-hop album). Top tier lyrics and production from Havoc and Trackmasters.
3652,2020-08-29 19:40:23,iiu3ld,nobody ever reached the level of illmatic ever again
3653,2020-08-30 01:56:40,iiu3ld,"Just admit that Nas' music isn't for you, because I'd say that almost all of his albums are at least good, it's just that Illmatic raised the bar so absurdly high that his later albums ended being judged too harshly imo. When I finally gave his newer stuff a listen (Street's Disciple and onward), I was surprised at how many damn good songs there were."
3654,2020-08-30 01:03:13,iiu3ld,"absolute stupid ass take, it was written is arguably better than illmatic

this subreddit needs to take hip hop outta the title"
3655,2020-08-29 22:30:44,iiu3ld,"At a certain point, I no longer believe you are out Fucking bitches at the club, and selling drugs. Being young just makes it more believable. It’s also why Eminem can never put out another album on the same level as his first 3, at a certain point it’s either redundant rapping about the same shit over and over, or it’s played out because they ain’t got nothing real to rap about. 

I’m honestly just hoping that at some point in the next ten years, we get a supergroup of all the hottest rappers from the 90 and early 00’s with Eminem as the only white rapper invited, and they call it “Dad 12”. Or something else dumb, and it’s basically just tongue in cheek raps about how now their lives are relatively normal, except they’re rich and famous."
3656,2020-09-03 22:32:32,iiu3ld,It Was Written???? To say that’s merely “good-ish” is dumb. Nevermind some of the other albums. IWW is a classic

3659,2020-08-29 17:08:50,iiu3ld,"Even if you don’t enjoy untitled and distant relatives (they’re not my favorite nas albums) you have to acknowledge he was still rapping at a very high level on both of them.  Also, hip hop is dead is great.  I don’t think return for form is the right way to describe life is good.  It was more like a high note in one of the most consistent/great careers in rap history."
3660,2020-08-29 16:56:42,iiu3ld,Cultural influence doesn't need to be mainstream. In my opinion life is good started the entire grown man rap trend we see. There is no 4:44 without life is good
3661,2020-08-29 16:57:03,iiu3ld,"Ok, you have a point impact wise and maybe it didn’t have a mainstream impact in pop music.  However, it’s the first album of its kind where a rapper transitions to a new point in his life (middle age) and the music reflects that and is high quality.  I think it paved the way for 4:44 and those two albums set the bar for rappers in their 40s to release music that’s relevant because it’s made for their fan base and doesn’t have to sell to 18 year olds.  Plus, just based on the quality of the music Life is Good is one of the best albums of the last decade."
3662,2020-08-29 17:06:37,iiu3ld,No
3663,2020-08-29 16:48:23,iiu3ld,All those albums are worse than life is good
3664,2020-08-30 06:48:00,iiu3ld,Wow....lol. I've never heard anyone say that before.
3665,2020-08-30 00:05:59,iiu3ld,Wasn’t *Nasir* also on Def Jam?
3666,2020-08-30 00:00:12,iiu3ld,Okay?
3667,2020-08-30 16:18:22,iiu3ld,"correct, more specifically: Nickelback a post-grunge band and the Beatles are a pop rock/psychedelic pop band depending on the album"
3668,2020-08-30 01:24:20,iiu3ld,"Better than Nas though 
Like who?"
3669,2020-08-29 19:50:26,iiu3ld,"Oops I just did a cursory search

Didn’t consider I Am but makes sense bc ~~it’s a double album!~~ **it was a followup to IWW**"
3670,2020-08-29 19:30:11,iiu3ld,Eminem and who?
3671,2020-08-29 22:05:05,iiu3ld,"Dude G-Eazy, Macklemore, MGK, and now Jack Harlow all get less respect than they deserve because they’re white and therefore “corny”"
3672,2020-08-30 16:57:52,iiu3ld,You don’t think he likes them?
3673,2020-08-30 02:20:30,iiu3ld,People been saying that before the review came out
3674,2020-08-29 20:03:03,iiu3ld,What?
3675,2020-08-29 17:41:56,iiu3ld,Yes deluxes are included. But Uzi had 32 songs.
3676,2020-08-29 17:43:00,iiu3ld,lmao happens to us all
3677,2020-08-29 21:18:59,iiu3ld,Wahh wahh wahh

3682,2020-08-29 20:12:40,iiu3ld,Gods son is 🔥
3683,2020-08-30 03:18:05,iiu3ld,It’s not ridiculous to hold him to that standard when he’s shown us that’s what he’s capable of. Most of his albums are barely even decent compared to his contemporaries
3684,2020-08-29 23:10:03,iiu3ld,Those are his good albums. But even those have more skippable tracks on them than good ones.
3685,2020-08-29 22:58:03,iiu3ld,"It Was Written had some really good tracks along with some really bad ones. That's been Nas's issue for a while. Sometimes the bad tracks out number the good, sometimes good outnumber the bad. But he hasn't had an album since Illmatic where every song was worth listening to. Usually there's 3 or 4 good ones and then 10+ skippable bad ones."
3686,2020-08-30 06:27:14,iiu3ld,If Nas made an illmatic over and over again people would still find a way to complain.
3687,2020-08-29 19:41:50,iiu3ld,That is true. Literally the best rap album ever made. Even Nas with his terrible ear for beats couldn't hold back the legends he had producing that album. Was like the Avengers squad of legendary NY producers in their prime. Nas was only 19 too.
3688,2020-08-29 21:28:53,iiu3ld,But Nas did again 2 years later...
3689,2020-08-30 06:37:47,iiu3ld,"Nas does pick poor singles but I guess his hands are tied because most of Nas music is underground.  People judge his music by singles but I Can, Daughter's, and Bridging the Gap isn't gonna make many think he's one of the best. Out of all his studio albums the best songs on each album has never been a single. You gotta listen to his whole body of work to fully appreciate Nas."
3690,2020-08-29 23:30:36,iiu3ld,"The actual problem is that when an artist like Eminem tries to mature and evolve, he gets completely shitted on. He had a lot to say on revival   He didn’t wanna rap about killing his wife anymore. There’s a ton of substance in that album and obviously it’s what he wanted to do at the time and release. 

People wanna shit on the older rappers for being redundant but when or if they try to mature and take on other topics, they get crucified by people saying they should release another album that sounds like one from twenty years ago. These guys can’t possibly win."
3691,2020-08-29 22:37:05,iiu3ld,"DAD 12 

I'm WHEEZING rn"
3692,2020-09-12 15:24:39,iiu3ld,">The hard truth here is Nas just doesn’t make very good songs.

This is categorically false and very easy to discredit lol"
3693,2020-08-29 17:12:50,iiu3ld,"Oh I enjoyed them all well enough. And I agree his rapping was still high level. But aside from Hip Hop is Dead, I didn’t think the other 2 sounded like finished projects, they both came off as lazy in some areas to me."
3694,2020-08-29 17:02:22,iiu3ld,"You know what, I didn't really consider that. I think that you have a great point there, I can't personally think of a ""grown man rap"" album from before its release. But then after Life is Good came out, we have ATCQ making a comeback with a phenomenal album that has a similar grown man feel, and obviously Jay Z like you mentioned. As an aside, I wish Eminem would get inspired by life is good and release something with a bit more maturity but who knows if that will ever happen haha."

3696,2020-08-29 17:06:09,iiu3ld,"You know what, another guy mentioned that it paved the way for stuff like 4:44 and I have to concede that you both make a great point. I did not consider its impact in that sense, but it is absolutely true. I'm also somebody that considers Freddie Gibbs' Pinata to be an ""underground classic"" of sorts despite not being super popular, so im being a bit of a hypocrite by denying that Life is Good shouldn't be considered a classic because it wasn't popular enough. Think you guys have convinced me :)"
3697,2020-08-29 16:51:33,iiu3ld,"You're entitled to your opinion, however if you think that Life is Good is better than good kid maad city then your opinion is wrong and I hate it hahahaha"
3698,2020-08-29 17:01:34,iiu3ld,That's a very hot take for GKMC. Although the rest of the albums he listed I wouldn't consider classics either
3699,2020-08-30 06:53:59,iiu3ld,I didn’t say it was loved all summer.
3700,2020-08-30 11:07:14,iiu3ld,"Technically yeah, because all Ye projects come out on Def Jam. But Nas' deal with them ended with Life is good"

And the rappers you mentioned also enjoyed a lot of commercial success."
3705,2020-08-29 18:00:34,iiu3ld,Yes my bad. I can't believe that Lil Baby's album outsold long awaited Eternal Atake without some crazy big hits.

3707,2020-08-30 15:45:07,iiu3ld,Absolutely not. Your opinion. Not most peoples
3708,2020-08-29 23:49:34,iiu3ld,Which songs on IWW did you feel were really bad?
3709,2020-08-29 23:05:31,iiu3ld,Good point! I suppose I just deleted those tracks from my memory and iTunes. Lol.
3710,2020-08-29 20:27:38,iiu3ld,"People over exaggerate to fuck Nas's ""shitty ear for beats"" he doesn't have the best production on his albums that someone like Jay-Z or Kanye might have but it's still above average production with a couple shitty beats every so often"
3711,2020-08-29 19:43:37,iiu3ld,"yeah, I think it has a solid argument for best album, period. but im not gonna there"
3712,2020-08-30 06:29:32,iiu3ld,I think the whole Nas picks bad beats is bs. A narrative created by people who haven't even listened to half his discography or born in a different era.
3713,2020-08-29 22:58:40,iiu3ld,"Arguably * not literally, guy"
3714,2020-08-30 15:40:13,iiu3ld,Fuck you you punk bitch.
3715,2020-09-12 15:23:18,iiu3ld,">I Can, Daughter's, and Bridging the Gap

All of those tracks were incredibly important for the culture"
3716,2020-08-30 01:21:54,iiu3ld,"the problem with Revival was that it sounded shit not that it was too mature. Anyway I don't believe it was that much more deep or reflective than his past work, it had just as many tracks about killing people, sex bars, toilet humor etc."
3717,2020-08-30 06:45:59,iiu3ld,Your right. Nas is damn near 50 but people still want him to rap about the uzi in the army jacket lining. Those days are gone. Nas grew into a man in his music but some didnt grow with him.
3718,2020-08-29 17:15:03,iiu3ld,"Yeah, I’m a big Nas fan and I get his beats aren’t like Jay-Z level great but generally I like production on Nas albums.  I think it fits his style even though they don’t knock.  I do think Untitled had some bad production on it though so that criticism works for that album."
3719,2020-08-29 17:41:14,iiu3ld,Revival has alot of maturity but with bad production for the most part

It’s not particularly different to deciding which beats sound good and making beats. Most musicians you listen to probably aren’t very harmonically interesting, but that doesn’t make them bad. Most musicians people listen to are listened to because their music sounds nice, and their lyrics are relatable. Contrast that to like McCoy Tyner, Thelonius Monk, Chick Corea, etc. who are working on a craft. Bob Dylan is closer to Eminem than he is to John Coltrane because the point is what he’s saying."
3753,2020-08-27 17:01:23,ihki87,">If a song's lyrics is able to move you, convey a message or incite emotions, it can be considered meaningful and well crafted. How hard is it to simply make braggadocios rhyming sentences about how many whores you fornicated and how much money you have. 


I never understood why art must be defined based on ""how hard"" it is to create. The difficulty level of it has nothing to do with the validity of art. Sometimes, someone has a certain tone of voice that they are born with that contributes to a situation that makes people want to listen to them, regardless of how simple their lyrics are. And that is perfectly valid as art.

Also, braggadocious songs about whores and money **do** move people. Maybe not to tears, but there are other emotions. Maybe it moves them to get amped up for a work out or gives them confidence before playing an organized sport. I think you are presenting a narrow definition of how musical art should function.

Art works sometimes in certain contexts. A painting might work well in a intimate gallery, whereas a graffiti mural might look best outside in a community environment. Today's hip hop has switched focus from lyricism to vibe. This kind of hip hop you're referring to works well in a party situation, or driving at night etc. Maybe not for a coffee shop.

See what I mean? Certain contexts make certain forms of art flourish more than others. I wouldn't play Bob Dylan in a dance club, for example."
3754,2020-08-27 13:45:11,ihki87,"""If a songs lyrics are able to move you, convey a message or incite emotions, it can be considered meaningful and well crafted."" 

Meaningful yes, well crafted no. If something is well crafted then it has used the craft and conventions of its genre effectively. If something is meaningful that is a subjective opinion which varies depending on whether you relate to it. Something doesn't have to be well crafted to be meaningful and vice versa.

Every art medium has different conventions and i think youre trying to take your preferences from traditional more melodic music genres and apply them to hip hop, which is more about rhythm and lyrics. 

Rap is more poetry and less traditional western music, so when you say ""songwriters"" as oppose to musicians you might have a point there. However hip hop is not trying to be what you describe. The lyrics are the main thing but thats kind of the whole point. Well modern ""hiphop"" is actually starting to have more in common with club and dance music. But just because the rhythm is more important than the melody, doesnt mean there isnt a musical element. Patterns exist in hiphop and rap and the way the words interact with the musical structure that doest exist anywhere else in music. 

All big industry music is a collective process. However it is also shaped by market demand. Back in the 2000 the young men wanted the aspirational gangster rap so thats what sold, and thats what artists were pressured to produce. However there is a huge rap scene of amazing underground music which you just haven't heard, because its not mainstream enough. But a lot of its really interesting. Hello Hi Hey by lifesavas. Devils Train by the lab rats. Loads of good shit. 

The artist will do whatever makes sense in their genre and their industry scene. If its not to your taste thats fine, but you shouldn't diminish a medium just because it doest conform to your idea of what music should be."
3755,2020-08-27 14:11:25,ihki87,"First, it's important to understand that calling someone an artist isn't a value judgment. Making art is no guarantee of making good art.

That said, rap is a lyrically dense genre. Fast-talking to a tight rhythm and sounding remotely good doing it is a skill. And sometimes the simplicity of the music is the point. The stripped-down working class aesthetic of punk and blues is often core to the message of the music."
3756,2020-08-27 17:40:40,ihki87,"Rhyme density and wordplay are not present in any other genre to the extent that they are in rap. So when you talk about Bob Dylan writing good lyrics they are good in a completely different way. 

I'm linking a video that explains rhyme density pretty well with examples:

https://youtu.be/QWveXdj6oZU

Just to compare: let's look at the rhyme scheme for comfortably numb (which I agree is a phenomenally good song but in a different way)

> You are only coming through in waves
>
>Your lips move but I can't hear what you say""

See how only the last syllable rhymes?

Now let's look at a rap verse and pay attention to rhyme density:


>""I bomb atomically, Socrates' philosophies
>
>And hypotheses can't define how I be droppin' these
>
>Mockeries, lyrically perform armed robbery
>
>Flee with the lottery, possibly they spotted me""

And when you hear this verse it's even more powerful because of the rhythm and the emphasis.

You're welcome not to like rap but it shouldn't be judged with the same metrics that other genres are because it's not just fast singing.

*Editted for formatting"
3757,2020-08-27 15:52:10,ihki87,"I think the most important point that has only been mentioned once in this thread is that rapping is *hard.* Not just ridiculously fast songs like Rap God and Godzilla, but the ability to rap lyrics, even moderately quickly, to a rhythm, is not something just anyone can do (I say this as someone who has tried). Getting all the syllables in the right rhythm, stressing the right syllables, not just getting confused and jumbling a whole word, these are things that take a lot of practice.

Also, there is so much good lyricism in Rap nowadays. Eminem obviously, but also people like Kendrick Lamar, and artists from around the world (Devlin is the best lyricst in Grime imo). Just for the sake of this argument, I looked up the lyrics of Collard Greens (which I had had previously thought of as a kinda 3d-rate but catchy song) and even in the first verse, there is so much good word play, double entendres, alliteration etc.

>I mean, take Old Town Road for example. It's undoubtedly catchy, but all Lil Nas X did was write a song and rap it over a beat he bought from youngkio. The lyrics are meaningless so while you can call Lil Nas X smart, I don't think you can call him a musical genius. Just like Steve Jobs was the business man and Wozniak was the brains. Lil Nas X is the Jobs and Young Kio is Woz. 

In every genre, there are people who are famous when they are around, but not remembered. You mention Bob Dylan, but when he was around, there must have been a million others like him, who were never remembered, because they were shit (like all the Lil's and Guccis). They won't be remembered much either, but the greats (Eminem, Lamar, etc) will be. 

>If a song's lyrics is able to move you, convey a message or incite emotions, it can be considered meaningful and well crafted.  

So many rap songs have been written that (in my opinion) express geniune emotion, for example ""Mind Playing Tricks on Me"" by the Geto boys, which describes what young black men in the inner cities went through in quite a sincere and not flex-y way, ""Headlights"" by Eminem, which is all about the complex relationship he has with his mother, the list goes on and on.

3841,2020-10-10 06:13:15,j88p7b,Im so happy that metro seems to be evolving as an artists and really putting his spin on whats popular. He knows that soudcloud bedroom producer sound is fucking fire right now and its so cool to see his take on it with insane bars from 21. One of my favorite projects all year.

3847,2020-10-10 02:44:13,j88p7b,JID 👀
3848,2020-10-10 00:11:30,j88p7b,Yeah Bryson said he doesn't care whether his album flops or does numbers because he's onto the next album by then. He's just making music for fun at this point
3849,2020-10-10 00:54:42,j88p7b,Timeless Interlude is so nostalgic
3850,2020-10-10 00:24:13,j88p7b,"Such a good album, man. Trapsoul lite is still fucking fire lol"
3851,2020-10-10 02:51:12,j88p7b,also it seems like people disappointed by his second album caused less hype for this one
3852,2020-10-10 03:53:54,j88p7b,tbh i'd rather have 10 good tracks>20+ that only have a few that are good. thats goes for any rapper. most of my favorite albums/tapes have about 10-12 songs and i can just let it play through.
3853,2020-10-10 00:41:37,j88p7b,"I've been playing on repeat since the release, so good"
3854,2020-10-10 07:56:10,j88p7b,"His album is doing really good numbers on Spotify, wouldn’t take this as gospel but you’re right, he just doing it for fun and that’s exactly what we need!"
3855,2020-10-10 06:28:48,j88p7b,Blackpink is also signed by YG.
3856,2020-10-10 00:15:50,j88p7b,very unsurprising but frankly doing these numbers 3 years after his last album (which made very little noise) and 3 years after his last big hit (wild thoughts) i think it’s pretty good. he could have done more if he added more tracks and features but for what the album is and the time it was released i think the numbers are good
3857,2020-10-10 00:04:19,j88p7b,"I'm not surprised unfortunately. I've been a huge Bryson fan for years, Trapsoul *heavily* influenced my sound as an r&b artist. But he followed that up with a weak album and then dipped for way too long."
3858,2020-10-10 00:38:43,j88p7b,Half the amount of songs that were on his last album so I think he did well
3859,2020-10-10 10:04:42,j88p7b,"with a drake ft aswell.. imagine the numbers on this without that, probably the 30k-40k range."
3860,2020-10-10 00:36:10,j88p7b,"Wish he didn’t drop the same day as SM2, I would’ve listened first week if it dropped this week instead"
3861,2020-10-10 05:36:33,j88p7b,Damn Bryson kinda flopped. Out of all of his projects I personally didn’t feel this one much. He’s one of my favorite artists but I’m not sure how consistent he is. Canceled and Blame were two pretty decent singles by him but they didn’t live up to the trap soul era. The mixing and singing by him on this record could have been a lot better IMO. I also think his beat selection has gotten worse. I was bumping it while in the whip and majority of the tracks weren’t hitting.
3862,2020-10-10 03:20:44,j88p7b,Never even heard of black pink...
3863,2020-10-10 00:13:55,j88p7b,"Ofc. I’ve never met anyone who listens to blackpink irl

E: I’m 21 and live in Atlanta I’m not 40. And actually thinking about it I do know one other person besides myself that listens to BP. It may be a bit of an age thing too. I knew way more Kpop fans in high school than I do now in college"
3864,2020-10-10 02:17:08,j88p7b,Lisa from Blackpink has a better flow than most rappers today
3865,2020-10-10 01:01:15,j88p7b,Yea I thought they had a chance to sell more than him
3866,2020-10-10 08:17:34,j88p7b,Lol yeah in the US. They sold 590k globally in one day
3867,2020-10-09 23:48:02,j88p7b,What’s he usually do? I feel like 46k is low for such a big name
3868,2020-10-09 23:35:03,j88p7b,did he do bundles
3869,2020-10-10 02:39:45,j88p7b,yeah. So interesting like.. i thought for sure that was the best album put out in months i don't even know who 80% of the people on that list are so I'm obviously living in a bubble.
3870,2020-10-10 03:25:23,j88p7b,Great album. Loving it a lot
3871,2020-10-10 01:36:49,j88p7b,Pure sales is the real metric of how many fans an artist has
3872,2020-10-09 23:13:31,j88p7b,Baby KILLING IT my goodness. The difference between him and #2 in album units is bigger than the difference between #2 and #7. What a year for him
3873,2020-10-09 22:52:39,j88p7b,it's crazy how many units uzi is selling considering the album kind of came and went
3874,2020-10-09 23:04:42,j88p7b,Still crazy to me just how popular Post Malone is
3875,2020-10-10 01:41:06,j88p7b,I really hope Chilombo goes platinum. It's almost there! An absolutely fucking flawless album.
3876,2020-10-09 23:27:57,j88p7b,i'll never understand the love for lil baby. there are so many artists doing the same thing at a higher level
3877,2020-10-10 04:47:48,j88p7b,Every week no one talks about how Moneybagg Yo has been a staple in the top 25. Who tf knew his album would be up there with some of those other names.
3878,2020-10-10 01:40:44,j88p7b,LIL BABY!
3879,2020-10-10 02:38:14,j88p7b,Damn Eminem still not platinum! Only sold 7k over last week! This is like watching Endgame become the #1 movie.
3880,2020-10-10 03:20:43,j88p7b,Not too bad for someone who’s been in the game for 30 years
3881,2020-10-10 10:44:11,j88p7b,What surprises me is how well he’s doing internationally. A lot of his songs chart high on the global charts in comparison to other rappers
3882,2020-10-09 23:43:42,j88p7b,Very few artists most commercially successful album is their best
3883,2020-10-09 23:53:51,j88p7b,"Imo, So Much Fun, while not experimental, is a way better project than 21's. Most songs on there have great replay value"
3884,2020-10-10 00:58:43,j88p7b,This is for sure 21s best project what?
3885,2020-10-10 04:51:23,j88p7b,They have crazy dedicated fans
3886,2020-10-10 05:03:16,j88p7b,The group had over 60 merch bundles so it's unsurprising. The only group that can sell high in the US without bundles is BTS.
3887,2020-10-10 13:54:33,j88p7b,On probation
3888,2020-10-10 02:45:33,j88p7b,Came here to say this wheres my gravy baby
3889,2020-10-10 00:07:53,j88p7b,I hate sounding like an old head but i feel the same about 95% of new stuff coming out
3890,2020-10-09 23:33:34,j88p7b,Didn’t really do anything for me either
3891,2020-10-10 05:06:58,j88p7b,Yup they're kpop
3892,2020-10-09 23:37:46,j88p7b,Why? Logic always does good numbers
3893,2020-10-10 01:38:43,j88p7b,He had bundles. It’s why his album fell waaaay off second week
3894,2020-10-09 23:51:26,j88p7b,Only did high numbers first week. Dropped out of the top 100 in the second week. 21 did better in streams
3895,2020-10-10 04:02:41,j88p7b,"tbh he has one if the most loyal fanbases in rap, he’ll always do big numbers. if anything i was surprised 21 did this well"
3896,2020-10-09 23:41:16,j88p7b,Why? His album was way better than what 21 put out...
3897,2020-10-10 01:35:20,j88p7b,These are US metrics my guy
3898,2020-10-10 01:20:39,j88p7b,"Blackpink recorded over 1 million pre orders alone for the album, but IDK how much they sold between release and now"
3899,2020-10-10 05:51:28,j88p7b,Very high. No one comes close to blackpink and bts in Asia. Not to mention how popular they are in the states as well judging from their numbers
3900,2020-10-10 10:28:43,j88p7b,"They're predicted to do 1mil+ worldwide, 500k from Korea alone."
3901,2020-10-09 23:43:55,j88p7b,kpop group. probably the second biggest in the world behind bts
3902,2020-10-09 23:46:20,j88p7b,kpop girl band
3903,2020-10-10 00:44:53,j88p7b,"suuuuuuper big kpop group

I enjoy their music alot too"
3904,2020-10-10 00:07:22,j88p7b,"Kpop girlgroup. 

Basically when you start seeing weird ass names in half in all caps, assume it’s kpop
ITZY 
LOONA 
SUPERM
STRAY KIDS

3905,2020-10-10 01:36:41,j88p7b,/u/Apg3410 you and me both just found out we're squares
3906,2020-10-10 01:02:08,j88p7b,DJ here. BLACKPINK is huge rn with the tweens/teens tik tok group. They're kinda dope tbh. Ice Cream ft Selena Gomez and Sour Candy with Gaga are both bangers.
3907,2020-10-10 05:09:10,j88p7b,Nah I am>I was was ahead
3908,2020-10-10 09:11:28,j88p7b,Well tbf i doubt they have a larger fanbase in america than 21 does
3909,2020-10-10 05:01:40,j88p7b,"He's good for the people that just want some cool rnb. Nothing experimental or brand new just a good vibe and good sound with relatable lyrics.

Bryson just sounds smooth when he sings/raps and a lot of people especially younger people fuck with that style of rnb. He sings like he's spitting game to a girl and also giving honest real life feelings. He's not too vanilla lovey dovey like Daniel Caesar, and he's not too emotionally heavy like The Weeknd.

Again it just sounds like a confident type of rnb that you can ride at night to in a big city with a girl in the passenger seat like PartyNextDoor's early shit. Pretty important niche in RnB imo."
3910,2020-10-11 01:01:11,j88p7b,"Nobody complains about Ozuna or J Balvin on the list, but Blackpink is an issue 🧐"

3912,2020-10-10 02:26:04,j88p7b,"It’s friday every week unless I’m late. Always has been. 

I do sales corrections once the Billboard article comes out, but there’s never any significant shift outside of rare occasions."
3913,2020-10-10 01:45:57,j88p7b,they rap on most of their songs
3914,2020-10-10 01:42:07,j88p7b,Half their album is rap and a lot of it would probably fall under the hip hop genre
3915,2020-10-10 03:21:50,j88p7b,"Pure sales are physical/anything that's not streamed

so merch bundles, digital albums for $10 and physical album sales make up pure whereas streams make up the rest

they dont necessarily matter, so many artists get by fine on streaming numbers but typically older artists/fanbases will get physical albums as opposed to streaming the music, which makes artists like Logic sell a lot of pure albums compared to his contemporaries"
3916,2020-10-10 02:29:59,j88p7b,Pure sales are album purchases as opposed to streams. 1500 streams = 1 pure sale

Edit: I didn‘t say this year‘s music was trash because in all honesty it was one of the best in a long time. However 2020 in general sucks and my remark was referring to that"
3923,2020-10-10 01:41:46,j88p7b,I predict he drops on Black Friday
3924,2020-10-10 01:39:04,j88p7b,rumour says he still plans on dropping this year

3926,2020-10-10 01:04:22,j88p7b,"Will Pegasus do numbers like that? I feel like Trippie should’ve released closer to when it leaked, otherwise numbers won’t be as good as they could’ve been."
3927,2020-10-10 04:32:31,j88p7b,I doubt it'll get over 130k. Realistically around 100k I haven't seen any hype outside of the trippie community for it and I've already heard the leak like 3 times and it's not insanely good or anything
3928,2020-10-10 03:09:44,j88p7b,JID's nice but he's not gonna make a serious dent on this chart
3929,2020-10-10 09:32:37,j88p7b,">	He’s just making music for fun at this point

Swear I hear so many conflicting things. Half of you guys say he doesn’t care about numbers and just makes music for fun and the other half say this dude hates making music and only does it when he needs money

Don’t know which to believe because I know he’s said before that he **did not** want to make True to Self"
3930,2020-10-10 05:27:01,j88p7b,bro that song is amazing. as soon as i heard those piano notes i knew it was gonna be peak bryson
3931,2020-10-10 03:53:01,j88p7b,"Ill agree the hype around Tiller isint as high as it was right after trapsoul but the man has been putting out solid, consistently good music for the past 4 years. That's an accolade many other breakouts in R&B and rap that year failed to do so fair play to him. Not to mention 2020 has the lowest hype levels for all forms of media that i have ever seen."
3932,2020-10-10 08:01:22,j88p7b,Yeah like ZUU
3933,2020-10-10 06:48:28,j88p7b,different YG unless this is sarcasm

3935,2020-10-10 15:16:00,j88p7b,roll out was kinda lowkey and tailored towards the fans
3936,2020-10-10 00:57:58,j88p7b,"That’s funny because I fucking love true to self. I don’t know why ppl don’t like it. So many bangers on there, and Bryson was spitting a lil bit lol."
3937,2020-10-10 01:33:45,j88p7b,How exactly is *True to Self* weak? Just because its not a retread of *Trap Soul*?
3938,2020-10-10 05:42:52,j88p7b,Yeah I agree I think Bryson inspired a whole new wave of trap soul R&b artists (myself included)  but he himself hasn’t stayed very consistent since his debut unlike an artist like Chris Brown for example . I think True to Self and Anniversary just aren’t good R&b projects personally. I feel he leans too much into rapping on these albums and when he sings it’s in one tone/samey and pretty mediocre. I’d love for him to make a actual R&b album for once.
3939,2020-10-10 01:36:53,j88p7b,you couldn’t take 32 minutes out of your week to listen to the album
3940,2020-10-10 02:08:32,j88p7b,"Nah I think it helped because both had drake features and ones RnB and ones Trap, it was like which side you want your mood to be on. Felt coordinated tbh lol"
3941,2020-10-10 05:00:26,j88p7b,Immensely popular kpop group. Like I would say 2nd most popular behind bts pf course.

3947,2020-10-10 03:51:23,j88p7b,didnt Blackpink headline Coachella last year
3948,2020-10-10 04:09:15,j88p7b,I'm pretty sure I know more people that listen to Blackpink than 21 Savage.

3950,2020-10-10 00:16:51,j88p7b,I was mostly surprised because of all the stans online who post fancams and probably each bought 5 copies
3951,2020-10-10 04:16:40,j88p7b,Blackpink fucking slaps. If you want I'll zoom with you so that you won't have to say that sentence ever again.

3953,2020-10-10 03:51:09,j88p7b,Because you don’t live in Asia you retard
3954,2020-10-10 17:34:41,j88p7b,"Hahaha same experience with me actually. Went to high school in Alpharetta, knew A LOT of Kpop fans before it even had this wave of popularity (\~10 years ago) and as soon as I got to college that seemed to totally disappear.

I did see that they sold out Gwinnett Arena a few months before COVID started, though, so they definitely have dedicated fans."
3955,2020-10-11 02:26:21,j88p7b,"> Ofc. I’ve never met anyone who listens to blackpink irl

im guessing you know like no asians lol"

3959,2020-10-10 04:07:40,j88p7b,"Her raps are solid, but her dancing is unparalleled. I wouldn't have thought that would be super important in the context of hip-hop, but I can't think of ""I Like It"" without association with her dance cover."
3960,2020-10-10 02:23:41,j88p7b,Can't argue with that

3963,2020-10-09 23:50:13,j88p7b,"He's always done 30k - 60k ~~except for My Krazy Life.~~

The West still loves him. He just stopped making noise in other regions.

Edit: I was wrong, I thought MKL did 100k but it only did 60k. YG has never been a high album seller."
3964,2020-10-10 02:52:57,j88p7b,"Up around 10k from his last album which absolutely surprised me. His last album couldn’t even get above 37k behind Go Loko being such a huge hit, not to mention the huge buzz from Stop Snitchin, so I really thought this was gonna be his lowest selling album to date."
3965,2020-10-09 23:39:18,j88p7b,"I believe so cause I got a digital download when I purchased the 'behind the scenes' book for $25. 

Quick Edit: [Yes](https://4hunnid.com/) If you go to the 4Hunnid website the title of the site is ""MY LIFE 4HUNNID ALBUM BUNDLES""

Either way I'm proud of him for building his 4Hunnid brand."
3966,2020-10-10 18:59:23,j88p7b,I thought Billboard counts them differently now? I could be wrong
3967,2020-10-10 02:59:02,j88p7b,Or it can also be a huge indicator of whose sales are inflated by bundles. For example how a few years ago Brockhampton had a historically large drop off from week 1 sales to week 2 sales.
3968,2020-10-10 03:10:43,j88p7b,This is not true in the slightest what are you even talking about
3969,2020-10-10 00:40:53,j88p7b,"I think it's more crazy Lil Baby is outselling Weeknd lol I honestly forgot exactly when they each dropped, so that's the only thing I could see why. I think Weeknd was a month or two after right?"
3970,2020-10-10 01:27:36,j88p7b,"It was kinda weird just how massively hyped that album was and how it disappeared after like 2 or 3 weeks  
  
And maybe its because of the groups I hang around with but I never even see people bumping EA like that  
  
Im not an Uzi fan but was the album mid or what?  
  
Edit: Dude EA is either AOTY or a flaming piece of shit judging by the replies lol  
  
I guess its just a very polarizing Uzi album though"
3971,2020-10-10 01:43:32,j88p7b,Damn I've had Eternal Atake on repeat all year
3972,2020-10-09 23:03:49,j88p7b,Uzi is for the children. Makes a killing on streams.
3973,2020-10-10 13:17:38,j88p7b,It obviously didn’t come and go for everyone lol
3974,2020-10-10 01:17:07,j88p7b,"tbh, selling less than Polo G is kinda disappointing for his status i think

edit: OK OK SORRY LOL i saw BB&B and thought “wow, that came out in 2020?” and still decided to write that dumbass comment im SORRY!"
3975,2020-10-10 19:29:55,j88p7b,"Is it though? I feel like he's the perfect recipe for high school/college white and white-adjacent kids. 

Just ""edgy"" enough, agreeable, ""trap music is low brow"", simple melodies, the persona"
3976,2020-10-09 23:36:48,j88p7b,Because his songs are fire
3977,2020-10-10 01:41:08,j88p7b,don’t expect to get an in depth response from lil baby fans 😂
3978,2020-10-10 09:12:13,j88p7b,"I really got into him the last years. I dunno, for me it's a combination of two things: for once, I just fell in love with this type of Atlanta liquid guitar trap beats him and gunna are just born to ride. I totally see how his voice can be off-putting, but to me it has a very engaging tone and his melodic, mellow tone often comes off as dedicated and soulful. Listen to his delivery on global or freestyle, I think it really is something special. The other thing tho is how he comes off as really grounded. Yes, his lyrics aren't innovative but a lot of the time he got those moments of shouting out old friends (""I made a promise my n are gonna ball"" is a sentiment I always found really likeable) and I think especially on songs like close friends, time or the bigger picture he seems very self-aware, not thinking to much of himself, not being preachy. I think those factors make him so replayable for me."
3979,2020-10-09 23:32:45,j88p7b,just stop. a non-single off his album does better numbers than many artists' best songs... he makes hits. that's that.
3980,2020-10-10 03:55:42,j88p7b,"He makes good trap songs to work out to, that’s why I like him. Who do you prefer that’s in his lane?"
3981,2020-10-10 01:37:29,j88p7b,Same I just don't get it. I've always preferred gunna when that argument was a thing and I don't really like him either
3982,2020-10-10 22:11:41,j88p7b,I like his features more. Same with gunna. They both have voices that kinda mix up the sound of a song.
3983,2020-10-11 02:18:33,j88p7b,Em did way better w music to be murdered by
3984,2020-10-10 15:19:38,j88p7b,"50 cent also got *huge* internationally and dude's got that sort of bravado and voice.

curtis won the sales battle worldwide at a time where kanye was clearly the bigger dude in the us

3985,2020-10-09 23:56:52,j88p7b,"Kanye's most successful album is The College Dropout... While many personally think MBDTF is his best, there's definitely an argument for TCD"

3988,2020-10-10 00:10:06,j88p7b,"That whole album felt like it was watered down for mainstream appeal, not many songs I come back to"
3989,2020-10-10 06:39:36,j88p7b,that album sucked imo and i love thugger. Felt like he was just trying to make mainstream sounds the whole time instead of being unique like he usually does
3990,2020-10-10 01:28:15,j88p7b,Savage Mode* is his best project
3991,2020-10-10 01:09:49,j88p7b,"How? Have you heard Savage Mode, Slaughter Tape or Free 1017?"

3993,2020-10-10 06:35:19,j88p7b,"Bundles don’t count for US charting so that’s a pretty silly take to make.

103k pure sales is great for US artists, let alone KPOP in a western country. This is a crazy achievement."
3994,2020-10-10 20:48:13,j88p7b,Fuck a piss test
3995,2020-10-10 01:45:01,j88p7b,"I mean it's pretty much because mainstream hip hop, which has basivcally become pop now, has saturated the market. because it's the biggest genre and there are so many one hit wonders, it's made soooo many ppl feel like they can do the same, which which makes most ppl in the market sound pretty similar. At least that what I think"
3996,2020-10-10 02:40:12,j88p7b,"i like trap and all but i find myself only listening to stuff that came out from 2015-2017 outside a couple albums. like wunna, etc. they aren't bad but i just can't bring myself to listen to it"
3997,2020-10-10 04:12:18,j88p7b,"A lot of new hip hop isn't all that memorable or impactful for me either. 

If it has a generic trap beat with no real uniqueness, I probably won't remember the song name three months from now unless it's in a playlist."

4001,2020-10-09 23:56:46,j88p7b,"Interesting, I've never heard of them."
4002,2020-10-10 00:08:41,j88p7b,why they on here though
4003,2020-10-10 01:37:25,j88p7b,this is really random but aren’t these k-pop mega stars basically groomed from birth to be superstars? i found that interestingly sad lol
4004,2020-10-10 02:21:59,j88p7b,"They’re actually really good. Their rapping is surprising good too, considering English is not their first language."

4007,2020-10-10 22:25:55,j88p7b,Ice cream is one of the weirdest songs lyrically. I can definitely see it as a party song tho and surprising haven't seen it on tiktok.

I am more than willing to admit that I paid the most attention to the BlackPink release this week, and I sound biased on it. I really don't think they'll suddenly overtake *Savage Mode 2.0*, but I'd rather let these estimates be determined on Monday/Tuesday of next week when Billboard formally announces them than try and call it tonight off of projections."

4014,2020-10-10 01:44:47,j88p7b,This year was not trash music wise. He’s definitely releasing anytime from late this year to early next with all the headlines he has next year

4017,2020-10-10 01:21:41,j88p7b,"I feel like its releasing so long after it leaked that people dont even remember that now lol   
  
Plus I always saw leaks as more of an enthusiast thing so the general market will still stream it like crazy"
4018,2020-10-10 06:15:40,j88p7b,"Why do people think leaks have big impact, Im a fan of Trippie but didn't listen to leaked album because I want to hear the actual thing when it drops"
4019,2020-10-10 11:37:13,j88p7b,Trippie usually does about 80k - 100k still does decent numbers and has a solid fan base
4020,2020-10-10 03:13:26,j88p7b,Hey man who knoooows
4021,2020-10-10 17:42:31,j88p7b,"he just did [an interview with genius](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pg63fT28b_Q) where he went into more detail on where he was mentally the past 5 years. its a really good interview but really long so heres a tl:dr

- it was criticism of trapsoul that initally got to him, leading to him taking more of a backseat on true to self while he let the label try to kinda direct the album

- ever since true to self dropped he's been recording songs for a project, serenity, that he said he really liked but still wasnt totally sure they were good to drop (he mentioned later that the songs from that album will likely be dropped in the near future)

- in january of this year he had a legal deposition that i guess inspired him to start fresh on a new record that had a nostalgic lean towards trapsoul. he didnt go into too much details about what the deposition was about tho, just that it motivated him

basically i think he's always wanted to make music and loves doing it, he just got into a bad rut creatively and started overthinking his work which led to almost nothing coming out the past few years aside from like a handful of short loosies"
4022,2020-10-10 10:02:58,j88p7b,"I might be wrong here but afaik his Grandma died around April/May of this yr and she was one of his biggest inspirations and supported him from day 1, her death has probably given him a lot of motivation to make music"
4023,2020-10-10 06:22:25,j88p7b,"The only part that kinda ruins it for me is that sample has been used so much already, and I have another song I love that uses the same sample very similar so it's weird."
4024,2020-10-10 08:56:05,j88p7b,I wanna live in the world in which west coast rapper yg is the one to found the k pop Label and now just hangs out in the blackpink videos Diddy-style so bad
4025,2020-10-10 08:01:54,j88p7b,Lmao it is a sarcasm
4026,2020-10-10 01:36:44,j88p7b,"I enjoyed it myself, but based on the critical reception a lot of his fans didn't feel it"
4027,2020-10-10 02:36:23,j88p7b,"i think that true to self is great but i think it gets a little repetitive, still like it though"
4028,2020-10-10 07:57:48,j88p7b,"Second this! Idk why true to self gets so much shit, I get it wasn’t anywhere near as good or similar to trapsoul but how many artists struggle to follow up their debut’s.... a lot."
4029,2020-10-10 01:37:51,j88p7b,"Personally I liked it. But I'm saying that based on the lackluster critical reception and Tiller himself publicly stated he was depressed while making the album and it wasn't what he wanted it to be. I wasn't expecting a retread of TS, but I also think he wasn't fully invested in that album."
4030,2020-10-10 05:52:55,j88p7b,You got some examples of your music I could hear?
4031,2020-10-10 03:04:54,j88p7b,"No, I’m not that big of a fan. Would rather throw on SM2, but if the only new album last week was Tiller then I would’ve checked it out"
4032,2020-10-10 05:41:38,j88p7b,"Holy shit. 1.3 billion views. Yes it’s been 2 years, but still."
4033,2020-10-10 09:02:00,j88p7b,Wtf 1.3 billion??? How have I not heard of them before this album release

4035,2020-10-10 01:41:22,j88p7b,I actually know quite a few BTS fans irl but zero blackpink fans
4036,2020-10-10 03:18:56,j88p7b,Shit i listen to BTS....guilty pleasure
4037,2020-10-10 03:30:12,j88p7b,“Sold”
4038,2020-10-10 02:52:05,j88p7b,"also i'm too old to be hanging with kpop stans, a lot of them are teenagers"
4039,2020-10-10 10:33:41,j88p7b,I remembered now I do know someone who listens to them. I checked fb and I know someone else who’s liked their fb page. They really don’t have much competition in terms of girl groups though so that statement doesn’t mean much. Little Mix is the only other active girl group I can think of and they’re mainly only known in Europe
4040,2020-10-10 20:40:04,j88p7b,Not headline but they were there
4041,2020-10-10 13:32:53,j88p7b,Yea
4042,2020-10-10 02:10:29,j88p7b,Yup. Im in the Philippines and it’s mad popular. They even play some kpop songs on the radio channel which does top 40/pop hits/etc.
4043,2020-10-10 19:25:52,j88p7b,"I mean, I don't really interact with any k-pop stans because almost every single one I've ever met IRL or online have obnoxious or juvenile personalities.

it's a stereotype but in my anecdotal experience, it's largely true"
4044,2020-10-10 01:00:21,j88p7b,they did do 103k pure which is nuts nowadays
4045,2020-10-10 01:40:44,j88p7b,Most of the album sales go to the Korea charts. Globally they sold a shit ton.
4046,2020-10-10 10:09:48,j88p7b,I’ve heard their stuff lol
4047,2020-10-10 10:31:28,j88p7b,I’m 21 (lmao) and live in Atlanta
4048,2020-10-10 10:18:15,j88p7b,These are the American sales charts ma’am
4049,2020-10-10 00:35:51,j88p7b,This is sales in the US
4050,2020-10-10 05:48:27,j88p7b,Rose and jisoo better
4051,2020-10-11 00:36:57,j88p7b,"They’re not lying

“Love to Hate Me” a random song on their album, skip to 1:55 - https://youtu.be/wlzGXcTzdzU

You can also listen to “Playing With Fire”."
4052,2020-10-10 02:07:16,j88p7b,Kinda sad. I prefer their output over BTS.
4053,2020-10-10 03:03:26,j88p7b,"He’s still making noise in other regions but it’s just the singles

His singles are bigger than they’re ever been on this and the last album"
4054,2020-10-09 23:54:33,j88p7b,Yo this album slaps tho.
4055,2020-10-10 01:13:01,j88p7b,"You’re right, he’s regionally popular and  doesn’t have the success of global artists like drake"
4056,2020-10-10 01:39:07,j88p7b,That shit be at Zumiez
4057,2020-10-10 03:09:09,j88p7b,Ah is that also counted under pure sales? Good point then
4058,2020-10-10 04:15:13,j88p7b,"Artists with dedicated fanbases like YG always sell a lot pure. Most people who listened to Savage Mode 2, for example, just listen because Metro and 21 are big names. I listened even though I'm not a big fan of either (it was boring as hell btw), so I contributed to the sales."
4059,2020-10-10 01:25:21,j88p7b,"And its not even by a small amount  
Baby is outselling The Weeknd by like 350k which is kinda insane to think about"
4060,2020-10-10 01:09:13,j88p7b,"My Turn released February 28.

After Hours released March 20. 

A three week difference, but Lil Baby has been carrying that momentum all year. Meanwhile, The Weeknd hasn’t had much after his album."
4061,2020-10-10 01:06:21,j88p7b,About a month after
4062,2020-10-10 10:38:57,j88p7b,"Baby also released a lot of deluxe tracks a few months after the original release

But Baby’s songs always seem to have a lot of longevity. I swear Freestyle was the most played song in Atlanta for like two years straight"
4063,2020-10-10 02:15:02,j88p7b,"The albums got super mixed reception. Like two of your responses say its his worse but imo as a kinda big Uzi fan I think it's definitely in his top 3, possibly his strongest body of work overall. I think a lot of Uzi fans didn't like it because they just want him to be melodic and shit and he spends most of the album straight up rapping."
4064,2020-10-10 01:29:56,j88p7b,IMO both versions were great tbh. Some of the tracks on the first and second are some of his best work
4065,2020-10-10 02:12:49,j88p7b,I personally loved EA. I think it is probably a candidate for album of the year.
4066,2020-10-10 01:39:30,j88p7b,"EA in my opinion is by far the worst Uzi project released. I listened to it when it released and haven't listened to a single song on it again. Luv vs. the world 2 wasn't very good either, but there's at least 2 songs on there I listen to every couple weeks. Almost like falling off a cliff in quality from Luv is Rage 2 in my opinion."
4067,2020-10-10 01:57:12,j88p7b,"To be fair the album (albums) dropped like a week before lockdown. He sorta stopped promoting it after that for some reason. Also I think dropping two big whole projects a week within each other doesn’t work well, it’s overwhelming. Only thing that’s good is more sales."
4068,2020-10-10 09:15:50,j88p7b,"I’ve listened to Eternal Atake almost every day since the album came out.
On last.fm i have 750 scrobbles on Eternal Atake and 340 scrobbles for Lil Uzi Vert vs the world 2."
4069,2020-10-10 02:02:44,j88p7b,EA part 1 was the worst project Uzi has ever dropped IMO. The 2nd part was much better but still overall a weak album from him because of how horrible part 1 was
4070,2020-10-10 03:18:44,j88p7b,I hear people bump Silly Watch and Celebration Station every so often but people don't really bump it like that. Most people that I know still like the album tho

4072,2020-10-10 01:27:41,j88p7b,Bro that’s for a post album that dropped back in April of 2018 doing those numbers in 2020. That’s insane longevity
4073,2020-10-10 01:23:24,j88p7b,not really considering he hasnt dropped anything this year. it also says he sold double polo g
4074,2020-10-10 01:26:04,j88p7b,that album came in 2018
4075,2020-10-10 21:01:10,j88p7b,"He,'s doing crazy numbers is all i'm saying, i get why he's popular bro! He caters to more than 1 demographic that's for sure"
4076,2020-10-11 03:21:21,j88p7b,You mean generic shit. He’s literally a plant
4077,2020-10-10 01:41:57,j88p7b,"fr lil baby fans salty asl in my replies rn lmfao

this is what im talking about tho, his fans think hes SO GOOD, i just don’t see it at all"
4078,2020-10-10 13:32:25,j88p7b,Lil baby has a lot of good music.
4079,2020-10-09 23:41:12,j88p7b,Lil Baby got it but Abel has 3x his Spotify listeners. It's surprising to see Baby above him
4080,2020-10-09 23:42:35,j88p7b,ok? just cause he's commercially successful doesn't mean i have to like his music lol
4081,2020-10-10 03:57:41,j88p7b,"Roddy Ricch, Uzi, Dababy, hell even Gunna"
4082,2020-10-10 00:01:39,j88p7b,">very few artists

Also graduation was more successful"
4083,2020-10-10 02:06:44,j88p7b,"well, it was a lot easier to move huge sales back then (before streaming). See: Eminem, 50 Cent, Lil Wayne, etc."

4086,2020-10-10 01:34:33,j88p7b,"Honestly thats kinda why i fuck with it    
  
I love experimental and weird Thug but So much fun was literally just that  
  
So much fun  
  
I just cant help to be like ""Surf surf surf surf yee"" with a stupid ass smile on my face anytime that comes on  
  
Its not his greatest project by far but i appreciate that someone like Thug can still release just fun ignorant music"
4087,2020-10-10 00:20:54,j88p7b,"I mean, sure it is stripped down, but I don't think that makes it a bad project. There's just a lot of bangers on it with dope production and Thug still is interesting on it"
4088,2020-10-10 05:07:30,j88p7b,Agreed. I was listening to some early thug today and it made me realize how comparatively bland much of his stuff today is and how ahead of his time his. 2014-2017 stuff was
4089,2020-10-10 01:29:04,j88p7b,How when ever project after has been more diverse and he’s improved even more as a rapper/artist?
4090,2020-10-10 02:27:37,j88p7b,Damn ppl rly sleeping on Issa and without warning
4091,2020-10-10 01:47:35,j88p7b,"i am > i was is my fave personally, then savage mode. SM2 is alright I guess, have to listen to it some more and see if it grows on me."
4092,2020-10-10 01:12:22,j88p7b,How? 21 has literally improved and every way as an artist. Those projects are solid but incredibly one dimensional. This project is incredibly diverse and versatile...how can it not be his best
4093,2020-10-10 10:45:38,j88p7b,Some of them yeah. I hate telling people I'm a kpop fan because of the extremist side.
4094,2020-10-10 14:27:01,j88p7b,Tbh its really Atlanta being so goddamn generic and everyone sounds the same from there. A QC collab album sounds like any migos album
4095,2020-10-10 01:55:53,j88p7b,"Yeah I agree with you 100% but I wasn't talking about the one hit wonder tik tok rappers or whatever. Tbh I don't listen to those guys lol. 


The mainstream rappers are just dropping dogshit albums and people are eating it up like it isn't something that literally could have fit in perfectly 3-4 years ago. Not that that's a bad thing (or that most people even care) but it's just boring when there's no innovation. there's barely any effort + the bar is so low to be successful so they don't need to try which sucks"

4098,2020-10-10 13:17:15,j88p7b,"The beats were far better

The lyrics were better 

The flows were better 

Savage Mode 2 was a cash out. Metro worst production of any album. 0 effort was put into this. Its a major downgrade from I am > I was which was a legitimately good project."
4099,2020-10-10 01:46:20,j88p7b,Maybe cause Logic actually tries and attempts to put thought into his lyrics lol
4100,2020-10-10 05:08:20,j88p7b,True I always hate the people who think they are the elitists cause they listen to logic
4101,2020-10-10 13:17:44,j88p7b,I'm not a logic fan?
4102,2020-10-10 13:21:56,j88p7b,"People on this sub are lame as hell. It's hard to be bullied by them.

I listen to DOOM; madlib, gibbs, wutang, aesop, etc. 

Joynera ight.

>you need to expand ur taste

I listen to more genres of music than you. You are such fucking idiot honestly like expand my taste. You listen to the most bland pop rap imaginable. I don't need some mouth breather telling me I need to expand my taste because I thought the most bland 21 album was bad."
4103,2020-10-10 00:17:09,j88p7b,"They have female rappers in the group, but still probably a stretch to put them here."
4104,2020-10-10 00:28:51,j88p7b,Their album had a cardi feature so that might be relevant ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
4105,2020-10-10 00:58:20,j88p7b,They rapped on more than half the album.
4106,2020-10-10 09:05:40,j88p7b,"They have quite a bit of rapping in their songs. 

Examples:

[BLACKPINK - Pretty Savage] (https://youtu.be/hx-PQXhdpks)

[BLACKPINK - Crazy Over You] (https://youtu.be/4VOMHN6M4Dw)

[BLACKPINK Love To Hate Me] (https://youtu.be/VE3i4_3fdA0)"

4108,2020-12-06 11:12:32,j88p7b,No different from lil waynes or drakes situation tbh
4109,2020-10-10 01:41:19,j88p7b,They have a few good songs no lie but their shit is so samey and gets old fast .. especially when you're not the one playing it lol
4110,2020-10-11 01:07:56,j88p7b,"They’re Latin American, Puerto Rican and Colombian."

4112,2020-10-10 06:03:52,j88p7b,Thank you for this
4113,2020-10-10 03:12:17,j88p7b,"He was spotted filming a video too I believe. And it may sound dumb, but I think the fact that he did a video on the whole TDE/pgLang debacle a couple days ago gives me hope too. If he wasn't trying to drop soon then I don't think he would've even addressed those rumors."
4114,2020-10-10 10:25:22,j88p7b,They might wait til they can guarantee those headlines don’t get cancelled though
4115,2020-10-10 21:55:35,j88p7b,No halloween will
4116,2020-10-10 17:44:57,j88p7b,"That was a really great tldr. I’ll have to watch the full thing, thank you!"
4117,2020-10-10 12:57:01,j88p7b,That’s exactly why people didn’t like it. Didn’t meet standards for fans
4118,2020-10-10 17:01:10,j88p7b,"How are you gonna call an album you actually like 'weak'? But now that you mention it he does sound like he's in darker headspace on that album since  it's tinged with paranoia and a certain arrogance that wasn't there on *Trap Soul*, but I think that worked in its favour to differentiate it from that one. The biggest slight I have against it is its length, since it really didn't need to be that long."
4119,2020-10-10 06:14:13,j88p7b,Sure here’s Spotify https://spoti.fi/34GOOQi
4120,2020-10-10 16:03:41,j88p7b,"Probably because you move in different musical spheres. There are probably kpop fans who've never heard of immensely popular rappers like Travis Scott, Megan, NLE, Cardi etc. Likewise, there are probably artists with billions of plays in other genres or countries that I dont know about."
4121,2020-10-10 06:05:13,j88p7b,Lots of great and interesting kpop groups imo - not too sure why all the gravity went to Blackpink of all groups... just sounds like they're performing over rejected diplo cuts from 2016.
4122,2020-10-10 02:04:54,j88p7b,the opposite for me.
4123,2020-10-10 02:12:02,j88p7b,What is bts
4124,2020-10-10 10:37:53,j88p7b,I actually really enjoyed their Tiny Desk
4125,2020-10-10 16:56:28,j88p7b,"Me too man, probably watched the boy with love video a thousand times"
4126,2020-10-10 05:41:56,j88p7b,"Me too, bro. Me too"
4127,2020-10-10 06:32:12,j88p7b,What the fuck
4128,2020-10-10 03:46:49,j88p7b,so are a lot of hip-hop fans
4129,2020-10-10 03:38:34,j88p7b,Alot of them are in their 20s also
4130,2020-10-10 10:30:04,j88p7b,I think this is it. I knew a decent amount of kpop fans when I was in high school. Barely know any in college
4131,2020-10-11 02:05:26,j88p7b,"Jaden Smith is known to be a fan of Blackpink, they have some decent tracks"
4132,2020-10-10 10:46:57,j88p7b,"They have damn near limitless competition in China, Korea, and Japan alone. Those countries shit out girl groups unlike anything you've ever seen"
4133,2020-10-10 14:45:44,j88p7b,Bro philippines top 50 charts in spotify is full of blackpink songs. They chart better in the PH than even in korea lol
4134,2020-10-10 19:28:43,j88p7b,"well I mean, it just depends where you are in the world. it's not only kpop fans that listen to BP, large amounts of average Asian-American people listen to them. most of the stans you meet, you wouldn't realize they're stans because you only know if the people who make kpop their entire personality."
4135,2020-10-10 07:59:31,j88p7b,"I saw a PolyMatter video a while back where he claimed that streaming never really took off in Korea, and K-Pop groups sell these like collectors physical albums"
4136,2020-10-10 02:18:20,j88p7b,Yeah they are predicted to sell 1 million worldwide.
4137,2020-10-10 07:01:26,j88p7b,I would’ve argued with Jennie but ok

4140,2020-10-10 02:41:10,j88p7b,Nipsey Hussle sold 30K Pure for Victory Lap. It’s definitely regional.

4144,2020-10-10 01:48:25,j88p7b,Yeah for real I genuinely think EA is one of Uzi’s best albums
4145,2020-10-10 09:18:43,j88p7b,"Strange how different opinions can be. I loved my first listen of the album and have listened to it almost every day since it released. 
Prices, Venetia, Lo Mein, Bust Me & Baby Pluto are all great uzi songs imo"
4146,2020-10-10 20:08:51,j88p7b,"Seriously, part one is almost exclusively hot ass. Years of hype and bitching about his not being able to release music and shit and that’s what he drops? Shit was worse than TBD."

4160,2020-10-10 00:29:17,j88p7b,"Maybe it's just me, but I felt like he didn't experiment as much with his voice like on previous projects like BTG, Barter 6 etc. He played it safer, which paid off, but for me it was a little too similar to everything else that's coming out. I was kinda baffled by the reception, but the lead single (The London) definitely bangs"
4161,2020-10-10 10:37:30,j88p7b,"Only savage mode is one dimensional. How are you gonna tell me a tape with Pimp, Out the bowl, and Slaughter your daughter on it is one dimensional. 21 may be a better rapper but his delivery is a lot less interesting and raw than it was in his early mixtapes"

Basically they can make some good singles but making an entire album of that quality is a lot harder. I love some the 21 songs recently but listening to the whole project puts me to sleep."
4166,2020-10-10 19:49:15,j88p7b,like chief keef? yea but i guess i have some nostalgia thing w shit that came out 2015-2017 too so i just sit around listening to future's 2015 run all day lol

Maybe you really do need to expand your music taste to the ""shitty mainstream hip-hop"""

4190,2020-10-10 07:04:28,j88p7b,">just sounds like they're performing over rejected diplo cuts from 2016.

Finally found the words. I like the music they put out but it always sounds like something else left on the cutting room floor."
4191,2020-10-10 06:55:03,j88p7b,It's just how they're marketed YG really has built the hype around them due to 2NE1 and BigBang so they easily got their hands on some international fans because BP has a pretty different image from the usual K-Pop cute concepts that were the trend around the time they were rising in popularity.
4192,2020-10-10 16:04:58,j88p7b,What are some other groups you recommend
4193,2020-10-10 02:49:25,j88p7b,"Korean boy band, probably the biggest musical act in the world right now."
4194,2020-10-10 02:48:14,j88p7b,K-pop boy band that's really big right now
4195,2020-10-10 17:34:33,j88p7b,Shit the production values for their videos are insane
4196,2020-10-10 06:03:22,j88p7b,ever go to a barbershop? lots of old heads lol. Kpop is ore of a recent thing (in the west at least) so the fanbase skews younger.
4197,2020-10-10 19:33:37,j88p7b,"I guess. Chicago's asian-american population isn't particularly high (it's increasing tho).

I did know a few pop in Toronto that listened to it, but they were Koreans. Maybe people bump it and just don't tell others"
4198,2020-10-10 08:52:57,j88p7b,Yes it's true. Physicals outweigh streams in Korea/Japan by far.
4199,2020-10-10 16:57:29,j88p7b,Jennie hottest by far
4200,2020-10-10 03:09:07,j88p7b,I think go loko is his biggest song
4201,2020-10-10 04:06:12,j88p7b,jealous x rodeo x hate on me
4202,2020-10-10 10:14:35,j88p7b,It might break the longest time spent in top 10 at this point. I thought when post set it with circles it would last longer lol.
4203,2020-10-10 01:50:40,j88p7b,"it definitely is, alot of the really popular snippets got official releases and hes definitely improved as an artist as well. The whole theme of the project was really good as well."
4204,2020-10-10 16:05:29,j88p7b,"his voice can be really jarring sometimes, and pretty cool other times. I don't get the hype but We Paid fucking slaps"
4205,2020-10-10 03:47:00,j88p7b,I tried to listen to one of his songs and was immediately annoyed.
4206,2020-10-10 02:09:00,j88p7b,wow its almost like im stating my disagreement with their opinions
4207,2020-10-10 03:48:53,j88p7b,"There's not enough differentiation between the products to suggest inconsistencies in popularity between artists, especially those that have primarily American audiences. If it was a Spanish artist vs English though, that might be the case."
4208,2020-10-10 10:41:51,j88p7b,Exactly. Blinding lights and his older pop singles are probably on everyone’s playlists
4209,2020-10-09 23:48:37,j88p7b,He doesn’t understand because he isn’t a big fan. I kind of feel the same way I find him generic most of the time even if he has some songs I think are more interesting like bigger picture. Don’t understand how he’s so much more popular than other artists in his lane
4210,2020-10-09 23:47:21,j88p7b,"yes, i dont understand why he get so much love because i think his music is bad and i do not see the appeal. is it really that difficult to understand"
4211,2020-10-10 16:09:41,j88p7b,I would! Imo “Please Excuse Me For Being Antisocoal” is one of if not the most consistent project out of the current trap wave
4212,2020-10-10 00:04:10,j88p7b,It’s been out longer. Graduation had like twice as many first week sales and more successful singles
4213,2020-10-10 01:44:08,j88p7b,"Holy shit, I never knew TCD was that successful. That's crazy."
4214,2020-10-10 02:37:28,j88p7b,how accurate are those numbers tho. the source is 2014 and artists have to request for their certifications
4215,2020-10-10 03:16:16,j88p7b,wait TLOP went double platinum and was the most illegally downloaded album of all time?? how tf did Ye follow that up as an album that sold less than 100K units
4216,2020-10-10 03:06:20,j88p7b,">that's... pretty much all of his music. lol.

Not really.   
Lots of his songs and projects are a lot darker in vibe  
The ignorant part is still there but its just less playful   
   
Most if not all of SMF is very upbeat"
4217,2020-10-10 05:45:39,j88p7b,Generic beats with the same recycled features are what sells i guess
4218,2020-10-10 05:03:54,j88p7b,I am bro I just wanna listen to something new like man I have been so deprived of hiphop I have been expanding to other genres
4219,2020-10-10 12:18:26,j88p7b,Take any album that was in the top 100 and it probably fits this description
4220,2020-10-10 03:04:40,j88p7b,Oh so thats why his shitty music is so good
4221,2020-10-10 02:35:32,j88p7b,Must have a brain the size of a walnut then cause its all pretty generic shit
4222,2020-10-10 13:48:09,j88p7b,"No it's just not a good project thats it. Stop with this fucking Bullshit oh it's just different. No it's not. It's a dogshit project. I love future, young thug, early Travis. Like stop with this fucking Bullshit dude. Project sucks nuts. God fucking  dammit talking to you brainlets is so fucking annoying. First you are telling me to expand my music taste. Now your telling me I just don't get the appeal. No I listen to this type of rap aswell. This is just a dog shit project. Fucking christ."
4223,2020-10-10 00:44:17,j88p7b,man yall carti fans are funny lol
4224,2020-10-10 22:22:26,j88p7b,Honestly facts. If everyone knows them as kpop then why we tryna pretend they hiphop
4225,2020-10-10 13:25:44,j88p7b,A lot of international music isn’t posted here because it’s mainly an English sub
4226,2020-10-10 12:47:35,j88p7b,I like K-pop but I can't definitely understand not being into it especially if your social feed is over saturated with it.
4227,2020-10-10 03:43:18,j88p7b,Kenny video this weekend 👀
4228,2020-10-10 18:35:44,j88p7b,It’s not really delaying it if they never had a release date in the first place. Also I have a feeling kendrick has quite a lot to say about what’s going on In America rn
4229,2020-10-10 23:14:49,j88p7b,"Exactly. Most artists are incredibly bias and hard on their own work, that's why I tend to kinda ignore what they say about it.

Critic reception seems fine, Pitchfork gave it a 6.6 for example, and it sold 100K first week, debuted at #1 and went Gold so sales were definitely good too. I honestly think it's just the fans trashing it and wanting more *Trap Soul* that's coloured the perception for this album."
4230,2020-10-10 16:20:53,j88p7b,Dope I like the pop sound keep pushing those releases
4231,2020-10-10 19:52:52,j88p7b,"Fit is cool, you should rap more"
4232,2020-10-10 20:59:59,j88p7b,"Idk, I just thought of the most popular rappers that came to mind. The shortta flow series collectively has like a quarter or maybe even half a billion views on youtube. Idk, there are better examples like Migos, Drake, Future and Kendrick. But nle came to my mind first, probably cuz I was listening to him more recently."
4233,2020-10-10 16:11:23,j88p7b,"Twice - &TWICE

ODD EYE CIRCLE - Max & Match (not Mix & Match)

Red Velvet - Summer Magic

Sunmi - Warning

Loona - X X

April - De Capo

DREAMCATCHER - Dystopia: The Tree of Language

Orange Caramel - Catallena

Red Velvet - 4 Walls


These are full lengths and EPs by girl groups that I believe to have some of the best music coming out of the industry. It's also a very entry level list but it's great for people who think kpop is too much blackpink and BTS and not enough anything else. If you have general weird biases against pop music these wont like convince you that theres magic hiding here (dreamcatcher might actually) but if you like pop music you should be able to appreciate the creativity and energy here. 

Theres a lot more I could reccomend like specific songs and boy groups and stuff but I think this is a fine enough start. Enjoy!"
4234,2020-10-10 13:00:52,j88p7b,They've got legions of fans who buy and stream the shit out of everything they put out but beyond the superfans literally nobody listens to that.

4238,2020-10-10 03:25:20,j88p7b,"I think 'My Ni**a ft. Rich Homie Quan and Jeezy' is the biggest and I think it got elevated by it being in GTA.

All three of those songs have done similar numbers on Spotify"
4239,2020-10-10 04:21:42,j88p7b,My Neighbour went 4x Platinum and has nearly as many streams on Spotify despite being released 7 years ago. Big Bank peaked at #16 and also went 4x Platinum.
4240,2020-10-10 19:05:20,j88p7b,"According to this site Apple Music accounted for 68.6% of My Turn first week album streams, so over double Spotify numbers. Hip hop seems to stream extremely well on Apple Music.

4241,2020-10-09 23:50:34,j88p7b,Baby is just one of the best to do it right now with actual depth in his lyrics unlike most of trap-rappers
4242,2020-10-10 01:43:22,j88p7b,Lmao all these stans acting like they don't know what you're talking about
4243,2020-10-10 00:28:49,j88p7b,Buddy. You said you didn’t understand how he does numbers. He explained how Baby does numbers. No one mentioned or cares about how you feel about his music lmao

4245,2020-10-10 01:58:58,j88p7b,at this point early sales are irrelevant

4247,2020-10-10 05:50:06,j88p7b,"yes it was illegally downloaded over 500k times the week it dropped, I wrote a paper about it in college lmao"
4248,2020-10-10 03:33:32,j88p7b,Ok I guess you’re distinguishing dark ignorant from fun ignorant then. What I was saying is most of his music is pretty ignorant. Not saying I think it’s bad (for the record)
4249,2020-10-10 15:52:51,j88p7b,lmao i can't imagine telling this to someone in 2017.
4250,2020-10-10 06:56:29,j88p7b,"then don’t listen to mainstream rappers? griselda has been putting out incredible albums, boldly james, action bronson, freddie gibbs. there’s a lot of hip hop out there"
4251,2020-10-10 03:10:20,j88p7b,yes
4252,2020-10-10 02:37:05,j88p7b,"its not meant to be some deep introspective shit, its catchy and a smart bar now and then. just because he's intentionally doing something you don't like doesn't mean its not good."
4253,2020-10-10 14:07:18,j88p7b,"Maybe you can't like it doesn't change the fact it is good for others (I never said this was amazing project for me I gave it 6.5 in a earlier comment) jus admit it bro you're one of those ""haha mainstream bad"" guys and again? Calling people who like a different type of music brainlets, you may like to think you are a elite music listener and everyone else who are not like you aren't but you that's not the case as you can't simply stfu and let people enjoy there shit also no pressure wasn't leagues ahead of Sm2. Both had there own greats. (Also try not inflating you comments with half of the content being ""music bad listener bad"")"
4254,2020-10-10 17:44:00,j88p7b,"Nah bruh album was decent u just a hater, also love ur guys debate u shld marry"

4256,2020-10-10 18:45:25,j88p7b,"They most likely did lmao. Obviously they never announced it but why would they so far ahead of time. The point is, if something is not released and is waiting for a different time to release due to something that happened it’s a delay. I’m pretty sure they wouldn’t want to keep pushing back the album over festivals"
4257,2020-10-10 22:57:04,j88p7b,"Thank you! I actually plan on it, got 3 more records like that ready"
4258,2020-10-10 16:16:15,j88p7b,Thanks. The only one on this list I’ve listened to is Loona. I’ll check the other ones out.

4260,2020-10-10 09:33:28,j88p7b,It wasnt in gta
4261,2020-10-10 14:22:51,j88p7b,Thanks for censoring. My black friend was reading this over my shoulder and he woulda cried if he saw the full song name.
4262,2020-10-10 04:33:56,j88p7b,"Lol well that’s definitely bigger

It’s just weird bc it probably didn’t chart like go loko did bc billboard has changed

Could be wrong abt that tho"
4263,2020-10-10 01:41:47,j88p7b,He's about as deep as a puddle
4264,2020-10-10 00:10:19,j88p7b,Would disagree for sure on the lyrical aspect a lot of his songs are loaded with rap cliches. If you like him more power to you just telling you how I feel
4265,2020-10-10 06:41:16,j88p7b,lol i like Baby but hes not deep whatsoever tf
4266,2020-10-10 01:45:08,j88p7b,i am sittin here explicitly saying i dont understand why ppl think hes good and they’re just like “HE DOIN NUMBERS! HE MAKIN SALES!” like bro that is not the conversation

4271,2020-10-10 07:11:46,j88p7b,"Yeah, but the fact that the mainstream became so water downed is kind of disappointing, especially for a genre that's meant to be a voice for the black community."

That's why I like future, lil uzi, young thug?

yes hip hop has always had political and societal undertones but it was never the main focus of hip hop, it was about the parties that these MC’s were mc-ing.

i see no difference now in the mainstream than what it was when i was growing up in the early 2000’s. 

i think people just don’t like the fact that the trap sound has taken the mainstream and that’s what’s dominating the radio"

Second man shut the fuck up we get it you listen to future and young thug it still does not give your opinion a fact worthy status on the new album by 21. you're immature man like you can't actually say why the album is ass and you have to go for the person behind the argument not the argument itself.

Also 21 album had amazing production, catchy songs and the cool morgan freeman documentry and I'm saying to appreciate both no pressure and sm2 and not act like a elitist . 

Third you're not even worth spending more time on, have a great day"
4284,2020-10-10 14:56:48,j88p7b,? We debating over the fact that you thinking an album is ass doesn't make it so. Have a good day?

Early 2000s had a shit ton of classic albums that are certified GOATs (or at least considering to be in the top 50), just off the top of my head;

Marshall Mathers LP

The Blueprint

Get Rich of Die Tryin'

The W

Roc la Familia

Like Water for Chocolate

Devil's Night

2001 (even though it released two months before Y2K it still counts in my opinion, it has an early-2000s sound).

Stillmatic

The College Dropout

The Documentary

The Black Album

Restless

Man Vs Machine

I'm sure I'm missing many more, but the run from 1999 to 2005 was a fantastic period for rap, both mainstream and underground. 

Meanwhile, ever since 2013 onwards it kind of feels like mainstream rap has degraded in quality and became a lot more appealing to the common denominator; I mean seriously, other than TPAB and maybe 4:44, did we really get any mainstream behemoth that shook the entire culture like we got with GROT and MMLP? Nah, at best, we got ""very well made albums"", and that's pretty much it, we haven't had a top 10 classic in a long time."
4291,2020-10-10 15:01:23,j88p7b,">First. You or I didn't say anything about I am>I was

I have in other comments.

>Second man shut the fuck up we get it you listen to future and young thug it still does not give your opinion a fact worthy status on the new album by 21.

I thought I didn't listen to mainstream music? Now all of a sudden I do? I never said it was a fact worthy status? Mind quoting me on that.

>you're immature man like you can't actually say why the album is ass

I have... Look at my other comments. 

>you have to go for the person behind the argument not the argument itself.

Because the person behind the argument is a mouth breather who has consistently lied...

First you say i don't listen to mainstream music and think it's bad 

Now your saying that I think my opinions are facts. 

You have consistently lied about me and what I believe. 

>Third you're not even worth spending more time on, have a great day

Someone's tilted. Take a break go for a walk maybe have something to eat."
4292,2020-10-10 15:01:48,j88p7b,Naw you want to debate over a preference. So fucking stupid.

4294,2020-10-10 15:07:36,j88p7b,Nah I meant that I added it as an mp3 to my personal radio station.

i honestly think it comes to a preference of sound though. i think looking back we’ll probably be skewing the definition of classic anyway. personally i believe “Culture” by Migos is a classic hip hop album because of what it did for themselves as artists but also just the trap rap genre as a whole. i know a lot of people would probably disagree with me but I think it’s a very important piece of work from the 2010’s"

4324,2020-10-07 15:06:11,j6otak,"@denzelcurryph the number of corrupt officers in this country is FAR less than good officers. The media just picks and chooses the stories that will get them the most viewers. You can’t take away an entire organization, because if a small percentage of corrupt people. For example, medical malpractice. Should we remove the entire healthcare system, because a small percentage of doctors are corrupt? Hell no! That would lead to thousands of deaths in a matter of days. Same goes with the removal of the police department, complete and utter chaos in a matter of hours. Law enforcement is what separates us from the animals. We just have to punish the bad officers, which did happen, and move on. Without law enforcement, your big house and pretty cars, will go bye-bye. Btw love your music lol.

I would be interested to hear about the percentages and profit margins of artists, management, record labels as it pertains to records, tours, and merch showing the numbers today (or pre corona) and then 1998. 

I know that the internet basically was like a gut shot through the record companies and I always heard that artists get their money through touring but is it the same today? How are artists and record companies able to monetize music in the age of digital distribution and is there any reason for an unsigned artist getting some attention to not give away their music for free to keep that momentum?"

4336,2020-10-05 19:12:29,j5p4cy,"Despite all the millions of new artists and songs being released a day, the vast majority of them won't continue. Soundcloud has millions of accounts with a single song uploaded.  

So many band and artist pages with ""Big things coming soon!"" Posted from years ago with no follow up.  I see it all the time on here with people saying stuff like  ""been working on this track for the last 2 years"". I'll go to people's pages who complain about not getting any traction and see they've uploaded 5 songs over the course of 3 years.

Honestly I feel that to have a leg up one needs to just work more. Professional songwriters with publishing deals are often required to write dozens of songs a month. Engineers record thousands of songs, peoducers make thousands of beats, bands play hundreds of gigs. If someone can't make a time or life commitment to the same degree that say an electrician or a computer programmer does, than a career isn't really in the cards. 

It's a hard question to ask yourself and many of us don't want to really answer it honestly so instead they just hold on for the lotto ticket of having post malone retweet your track. Just like winning the lottery it ain't going to happen."

Attention spans are too short. Building fanbases requires momentum and lots of it."

Edit 1: Wow, this really blew up! Thanks for the upvotes, kind strangers!

Edit 2: thanks for the gold kinda stranger I didn’t expect this post to blow up! My life started growing up in a small farm in northern Kansas. My father was a farmer and my mother was a cashier in our local town down the dirt road. We didn’t have much and income was very little, my best toy I got growing up was a pig bladder blown up like a balloon that I could play around with between me and my two brothers. At the age of 11 things started getting tougher in my house life due to my fathers drinking problem as it was not a good harvest that year. Like his father before him once he was done working he would come home and drink but unlike his father he wouldn’t beat us unless we messed up, his father left him and his mother to fend for themselves after world war 2 though so he had it tougher than me growing up. One time my father did drink too much and he hit my little brother Jamey. Jamey didn’t know what to do and ran away during the night during a storm. The entire family was out looking for him but we never saw Jamey again. This made my father drink more and lead him to take his life when I was at the age of 16. My older brother and me had to completely take over the farm with the help of our mom quitting her job as a cashier, life got very hard from here on out. We got a break when I was 18 with a good harvest we were able to save up some money. I was able to move out at the age of 21 and into a larger city in Tennessee. It was hard leaving the family as my ma was getting older but my older brother completely took over the farm and even expanded it into a more profitable work. I began working in what I was good at, repairing mechanics. I was a hard worker and moved up in my chain of work easily within my town. I dated aroun’ a bit but never settled down with anyone I would write home about for my first few years. When I was 26 I got a call from my ma, my brother was working with some machinery on the farm and got his hand caught in it and heavily damaged. I had to come home and help with the farm, at the time I had attained a high position as a senior mechanic within an auto shop and sometimes worked on the side with repairing electronics. I went home and had to help with the farm for a year, ma wasn’t doing good at all. She passed the next year due to kidney disease. My brother eventually recovered and I returned to Tennessee, I attempted to return to my position but due to the time I was out I had been long replaced. I had to begin to work from the bottom again when I had a client come in, she was the most beautiful woman I ever seen in Tennessee with gorgeous brown hair. Nice to say that we hit it off pretty well, within a few weeks we were dating. I can say that she was one of the best things to have happened to me in my life. At the age of 30 I married her and my first child was on the way then. I had returned to my previous position and bought a nice house near the mountains of Tennessee. At the age of 34 my second child was born. My two kids are now both in high school, one a freshman, another a Senior. I continued my career into more electronics working on computers and fixing them. In 2013 while googling how to fix a small problem with a motherboard I found a strange site named reddit.com, this website had all the answers I needed and a community always ready to help. I’ve been on the site ever since. As you can see recently, I commented on this thread and some kind stranger gave me gold. Thank you again kind stranger.

""M-m... M""

No one was paying attention in the crossroads of New York as I was giving my speech.

""M-m-mine...""

However, one person was intrigued in what I was saying.

""M-m-m-minecraft...""

Then it was just a domino effect, ten more people are watching.

""Minecraft...""

A hundred were now watching, this had caught the attention of even the busy drivers in rush hour. Their faces in anticipation, some were even scared. Others were complaining that this isn't the real deal.

""MINECRAFT...""

But they all suddenly started cheering, shaking, praying. When they heard my tone, my pitch, my timbre.... they all knew what was going to come next. They realized... that salvation of the human race has finally come.

""Minecraft good Fortnite bad""

And then the silence broke

""OOOIOIIUUUUUGHHHhJJHHHHHWAASEAAAa//::""

Thousands of people fell to their knees, yelling orgasmically. People starting crying tears of joy, others were running and thanking God, News reporters were already on the scene, broadcasting the entire thing nationwide and consequently the entire world. Hundreds of people came out of their cars, buses, taxis, stores, and subway stations hooting and hollering. It was a miracle unfolding.

I started to say the next sentence relayed to me by our Lord and Savior.

""M-m-mi... Mine...""

Already some people fainted at just the mere sound of my voice. Even more people came. Some were jumping from planes thousands of feet in the air, others ran or swam miles to here in mere seconds. I think I even spotted a few famous people.

""MINE...""

Nearly a million people were here now. There's now Europeans, Canadians, Mexicans, Latin Americans, West Coasters, Africans, and even several Asians and one Australian. They were screaming hysterically, bringing gifts for me, taking pictures and videos. Fireworks and confetti everywhere, helicopters, and even Donald Trump was here with his family bowing down to me.

""MINEC-C-C-CRAFT voice crack""

A billion people were here now. Even animals from all over the world were coming in herds. I could see Pewdiepie &amp;amp;amp; Martiza, Elon Musk, Keanu Reeves, Lil Nas X, 50 Cent, Oprah Winfrey, the Kardashians, and so many other people. Many people were having seizures, heart attacks, and strokes from the sheer excitement, and some were being trampled to death because of the huge crowd. The screaming was deafening. Some just came straight out of their bathroom, school, work, or their parenting... but it doesn't matter now.

""MMMMMMIIIIINNNNEEECRAAAFTTTTT""

No matter what was your race, gender, ethnicity, sexuality, religion, economic class, etc... it didn't matter. All of humanity has come together for this one moment. Millions of people have died to due plane crashes, car crashes, doctors abandoning their patients, parents abandoning their children... just to be here, but it will all be worth it.

Nearly half of humanity is here now. Even the dead came out their graves for this. Everyone is climbing on top of each other and on the walls of skyscrapers since they couldn't fit. So many lights, music, dancing, feasts... yet barely a minute passed. Humanity is very interesting.

10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...

I look at the smiling faces of the crowd in front of me. I look at the death and destruction that came from sacrifice to attend this event. This is it. We're ready.

Billions of people around the world disintegrated into their pure chemical compounds that composed their bodies, then their atoms, then their protons/neutrons/electrons, and finally their quarks... as they heard that holy sentence. The distant echoes of yelling can heard from thousands of miles. This... this was their ultimate purpose in life. This is the culmination of everything that has happened in human history, it is reason why life even existed in the first place. They weren't screaming in terror, they were shouting in orgasmic joy. They could finally die happy. Their entire lives flashed before their eyes as they saw their loved ones. They saw their ultimate fantasy. They can finally be freed from their imperfect bodies in this imperfect world.

The Sun blinked out. The Moon crashed into the Earth. The Earth turned into dust. The Solar System collapsed into a state of entropy. The Milky Way hosts a firework show of supernovas. All the galaxies of the universe colliding with one another. Reality is falling apart. That's because reality doesn't need to exist anymore. It has reached its goal. Spacetime has fallen. Matter ceases to exist. Not even the concept of nothing exists. The universe was never born.

Humanity is gone. Everything is gone. We are now one. Evil doesn't exist anymore. Insecurities don't exist anymore.  Fear, sadness, anger don't exist anymore. Just hope, love, and harmony for eternity. This is what we were meant to be. This is our final evolution stage.

This is heaven. This is what it means to be happy.

Congratulations."

Awweady some peopwe fainted at just the mewe sound of my voice. Even mowe peopwe came. Some wewe jumping fwom pwanes thousands of feet in the aiw, othews wan ow swam miwes to hewe in mewe seconds. I think I even spotted a few famous peopwe.

""MINE...""

Neawwy a miwwion peopwe wewe hewe now. Thewe's now Euwopeans, Canadians, Mexicans, Watin Amewicans, West Coastews, Afwicans, and even sevewaw Asians and one Austwawian. They wewe scweaming hystewicawwy, bwinging gifts fow me, taking pictuwes and videos. Fiwewowks and confetti evewywhewe, hewicoptews, and even Donawd Twump was hewe with his famiwy bowing down to me.

""MINEC-C-C-CWAFT voice cwack""

A biwwion peopwe wewe hewe now. Even animaws fwom aww ovew the wowwd wewe coming in hewds. I couwd see Pewdiepie &amp;amp;amp; Mawtiza, Ewon Musk, Keanu Weeves, Wiw Nas X, 50 Cent, Opwah Winfwey, the Kawdashians, and so many othew peopwe. Many peopwe wewe having seizuwes, heawt attacks, and stwokes fwom the sheew excitement, and some wewe being twampwed to death because of the huge cwowd. The scweaming was deafening. Some just came stwaight out of theiw bathwoom, schoow, wowk, ow theiw pawenting... but it doesn't mattew now.

""MMMMMMIIIIINNNNEEECWAAAFTTTTT""

No mattew what was youw wace, gendew, ethnicity, sexuawity, wewigion, economic cwass, etc... it didn't mattew. Aww of humanity has come togethew fow this one moment. Miwwions of peopwe have died to due pwane cwashes, caw cwashes, doctows abandoning theiw patients, pawents abandoning theiw chiwdwen... just to be hewe, but it wiww aww be wowth it.

Neawwy hawf of humanity is hewe now. Even the dead came out theiw gwaves fow this. Evewyone is cwimbing on top of each othew and on the wawws of skyscwapews since they couwdn't fit. So many wights, music, dancing, feasts... yet bawewy a minute passed. Humanity is vewy intewesting.

10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...

I wook at the smiwing faces of the cwowd in fwont of me. I wook at the death and destwuction that came fwom sacwifice to attend this event. This is it. We'we weady.

Biwwions of peopwe awound the wowwd disintegwated into theiw puwe chemicaw compounds that composed theiw bodies, then theiw atoms, then theiw pwotons/neutwons/ewectwons, and finawwy theiw quawks... as they heawd that howy sentence. The distant echoes of yewwing can heawd fwom thousands of miwes. This... this was theiw uwtimate puwpose in wife. This is the cuwmination of evewything that has happened in human histowy, it is weason why wife even existed in the fiwst pwace. They wewen't scweaming in tewwow, they wewe shouting in owgasmic joy. They couwd finawwy die happy. Theiw entiwe wives fwashed befowe theiw eyes as they saw theiw woved ones. They saw theiw uwtimate fantasy. They can finawwy be fweed fwom theiw impewfect bodies in this impewfect wowwd.

The Sun bwinked out. The Moon cwashed into the Eawth. The Eawth tuwned into dust. The Sowaw System cowwapsed into a state of entwopy. The Miwky Way hosts a fiwewowk show of supewnovas. Aww the gawaxies of the univewse cowwiding with one anothew. Weawity is fawwing apawt. That's because weawity doesn't need to exist anymowe. It has weached its goaw. Spacetime has fawwen. Mattew ceases to exist. Not even the concept of nothing exists. The univewse was nevew bown.

Humanity is gone. Evewything is gone. We awe now one. Eviw doesn't exist anymowe. Insecuwities don't exist anymowe.  Feaw, sadness, angew don't exist anymowe. Just hope, wove, and hawmony fow etewnity. This is what we wewe meant to be. This is ouw finaw evowution stage.

This is heaven. This is what it means to be happy.

Edit 1: Wow, this really blew up! Thanks for the upvotes, kind strangers!

Edit 2: thanks for the gold kinda stranger I didn’t expect this post to blow up! My life started growing up in a small farm in northern Kansas. My father was a farmer and my mother was a cashier in our local town down the dirt road. We didn’t have much and income was very little, my best toy I got growing up was a pig bladder blown up like a balloon that I could play around with between me and my two brothers. At the age of 11 things started getting tougher in my house life due to my fathers drinking problem as it was not a good harvest that year. Like his father before him once he was done working he would come home and drink but unlike his father he wouldn’t beat us unless we messed up, his father left him and his mother to fend for themselves after world war 2 though so he had it tougher than me growing up. One time my father did drink too much and he hit my little brother Jamey. Jamey didn’t know what to do and ran away during the night during a storm. The entire family was out looking for him but we never saw Jamey again. This made my father drink more and lead him to take his life when I was at the age of 16. My older brother and me had to completely take over the farm with the help of our mom quitting her job as a cashier, life got very hard from here on out. We got a break when I was 18 with a good harvest we were able to save up some money. I was able to move out at the age of 21 and into a larger city in Tennessee. It was hard leaving the family as my ma was getting older but my older brother completely took over the farm and even expanded it into a more profitable work. I began working in what I was good at, repairing mechanics. I was a hard worker and moved up in my chain of work easily within my town. I dated aroun’ a bit but never settled down with anyone I would write home about for my first few years. When I was 26 I got a call from my ma, my brother was working with some machinery on the farm and got his hand caught in it and heavily damaged. I had to come home and help with the farm, at the time I had attained a high position as a senior mechanic within an auto shop and sometimes worked on the side with repairing electronics. I went home and had to help with the farm for a year, ma wasn’t doing good at all. She passed the next year due to kidney disease. My brother eventually recovered and I returned to Tennessee, I attempted to return to my position but due to the time I was out I had been long replaced. I had to begin to work from the bottom again when I had a client come in, she was the most beautiful woman I ever seen in Tennessee with gorgeous brown hair. Nice to say that we hit it off pretty well, within a few weeks we were dating. I can say that she was one of the best things to have happened to me in my life. At the age of 30 I married her and my first child was on the way then. I had returned to my previous position and bought a nice house near the mountains of Tennessee. At the age of 34 my second child was born. My two kids are now both in high school, one a freshman, another a Senior. I continued my career into more electronics working on computers and fixing them. In 2013 while googling how to fix a small problem with a motherboard I found a strange site named reddit.com, this website had all the answers I needed and a community always ready to help. I’ve been on the site ever since. As you can see recently, I commented on this thread and some kind stranger gave me gold. Thank you again kind stranger.

Looks like these are his lowest numbers since he broke out as an artist in ~2015.

I don't think his career is done entirely cause he clearly has fans that will eat up whatever he says, but I can't see him having too much of an upward trajectory from here on out. I'd imagine high profile features are going to be harder for him to get cause people won't wanna work with the guy who shot meg, and if I'm not mistaken he's independant now so there's no major label to pump a bunch of money into marketing. Plus call me a hater but I don't think Tory Lanez is ever going to drop something so jaw droppingly impressive that it makes the masses take notice and look past what he did."

4414,2020-10-03 18:46:10,j43txm,All of my friends who don't listen to Hip Hop are asking me if I've heard this album lol
4415,2020-10-03 04:46:58,j43txm,"honestly thought joji would hit 100k, either way 95k is pretty good"
4416,2020-10-03 05:23:17,j43txm,where are the numbers for Lil Reese
4417,2020-10-03 16:24:31,j43txm,W for Tory considering it was on SoundCloud too
4418,2020-10-03 13:43:35,j43txm,God that mgk album is terrible I don’t get it
4419,2020-10-03 14:07:08,j43txm,That MGK album wasn't a hip hop album. Why are we counting it here?
4420,2020-10-02 23:21:22,j43txm,damn tory lanez outsold by mgk that boy goin out sad
4421,2020-10-03 15:50:56,j43txm,"Ive been trying to be more positive in life because there’s already so much negativity in the world, but that MGK album is the musical equivalent of a botched vasectomy.

I say this as someone who loves pop-punk, he just took the absolute worst of the genre and made some generic ass butt rock. Listen to No Dream if you want to hear a solid pop-punk album from 2020, not this shit."
4422,2020-10-02 23:51:55,j43txm,I can’t believe Eminem destroyed machine gun Kelly so bad he turned him into fall out boy.
4423,2020-10-03 02:23:22,j43txm,"Yeah A$AP Mob in general really hasn't come close to being as popular as they were 5 years ago - depending on if you count Carti. Testing had a huuuge marketing rollout and only sold 75k week one, which is half of what ALLA did a few years prior. It sucks to watch them fade away because I was such a huge A$AP fan when they first started getting big 8-9 years ago. I still like this Ferg LP but I realize he's just not popular anymore.

As for Spill, idk how big they have gotten since ROTD3. You gotta remember in 2018 DiCaprio 2 only did 16k and last year Mirrorland barely did 11k. I just straight up have no idea how big they are today because a lot happened with the success of ROTD3."
4424,2020-10-03 07:08:08,j43txm,"> Damn Ferg didn’t even sell 10K dude has officially fallen off.

Thats a huge flop for an album with features from Tyga, Nicki, Wayne, Fivio, Mulatto and Diddy  
   
Like just filming that Dennis Rodman music video probably costs more than the album brought in lmao"
4425,2020-10-03 03:16:44,j43txm,It's a shame that album had only heaters. There was next to no promo besides the nicki single though
4426,2020-10-03 03:25:19,j43txm,The Ferg album was so fucking disappointing to me :(
4427,2020-10-03 09:25:10,j43txm,Ferg had an album?
4428,2020-10-03 21:00:37,j43txm,I stream all earthgang/jid stuff religiously but tbh the spillville album was kinda weak. it was a vibe for sure but there wasn’t any songs I wanted to come back to besides the singles.
4429,2020-10-03 06:47:55,j43txm,😔😔
4430,2020-10-03 04:16:39,j43txm,How much did he sell?
4431,2020-10-03 03:01:50,j43txm,Im always so suprised when i see you pop up because i remember you all the way back from futhead lmao
4432,2020-10-03 00:17:24,j43txm,14yos who used to say the n word are hyping him up like crazy
4433,2020-10-02 23:58:09,j43txm,His fanbase is very die hard tbh
4434,2020-10-02 23:54:42,j43txm,"Prime example of an artist successfully reinventing themselves.

Went from flopping in the rap scene to producing these numbers in the punk rock/pop punk (or whatever you call that genre)."
4435,2020-10-03 00:27:26,j43txm,I think he finally broke into the fanbase that blackbear caters to
4436,2020-10-03 02:48:50,j43txm,"I'm surprised because I liked Binge but haven't bothered to listen to his new album; I hate rap-rock fusion it's so cringe to me

He does have a die-hard fan base tho, mostly girls in their 20s"
4437,2020-10-03 13:44:44,j43txm,That album is hot garbage though

4444,2020-10-02 23:30:25,j43txm,"idk with YG anymore, this album lacked a big hit and its very short too, so dont think it will reach much higher than 20 - 25k"
4445,2020-10-03 03:06:11,j43txm,YG sub 10k calling it right now

4450,2020-10-03 04:52:14,j43txm,Should have been #1😭😭😭
4451,2020-10-02 23:45:48,j43txm,Probably doesn't chart at all so I'd guess it's hard to find someone reporting the numbers. Could be wrong tho
4452,2020-10-03 01:17:32,j43txm,"Probably sold less than 9k so didn’t chart, hard to get the numbers if that’s the case"
4453,2020-10-03 16:18:25,j43txm,"Why lmao?

He had no promo, blackballed from radio, no features, and no label. 37K is a success, all things considered."
4454,2020-10-03 02:39:14,j43txm,Damn Juice all over that chart
4455,2020-10-03 07:07:14,j43txm,goodbye & good riddance selling that much over 2 years since its release (and more than his 2019 album) is crazy af
4456,2020-10-03 07:10:05,j43txm,Every week I’m still surprised Eminem isn’t over 1 mill yet
4457,2020-10-02 23:03:42,j43txm,"37k while being black balled, dropping a surprise album, no rollout no major label backing, very impressive IMO. I agree with everything you said I think it saw heavy spins early because people were curious but then attention waned a bit. 

Personally I thought the album was very good, one of the better projects this year. The problem is I can’t listen to this around my girl or any other women in my life. I can’t play it at functions. Therefore, it just won’t be getting that much spin from me despite it being very good."
4458,2020-10-03 14:54:13,j43txm,"I was so sure that he'd sell more than predicted (like 60k) because:

1. People are curious what happened. He's really bigged himself over the last year prior to this incident
2. The album itself, from what I've heard, is pretty good. I haven't heard any criticism of the album itself

I guess maybe the curiosity listens only really amounts to one listen sometimes.

There's also not really any singles on this one compared to his last albums and there's no features."
4459,2020-10-03 20:02:05,j43txm,"If he doesn’t go to jail for it specifically (I can’t remember if the charges are just gun possession or for the shooting) I dont see support for him fading consistently past where it is now. 

If people won’t bring charges he won’t go away for long enough."
4460,2020-10-03 03:18:41,j43txm,"worst take ive ever seen. the guy didnt even drop a music video until a week after the album release, and the music video pulled 10mil in like 2 daysl. the album was made in under 2 months. there was like one feature on the whole album. etc etc etc

this is far from being a complete tory project. he obviously wanted to drop music while the controvery was still warm, thats all"
4461,2020-10-02 23:57:20,j43txm,Chris brown beat rhianna and came back (and there were photos and no question what happened). Tory isnt as big as chris obviously but his public image took way less of a hit imo. He def wont be as big as he could have been but he wont completely fall off like some people think
4462,2020-10-02 22:48:48,j43txm,"I don't think there's an album that good in him, I agree.

I hope to see him just fade away from the music industry at this point."

4464,2020-10-03 01:35:09,j43txm,Lecrae doesn't get the respect he deserves and the only reason I can think why is the Christian label turns people away. That album was pure class and Lecrae's flows are flawless
4465,2020-10-04 01:26:51,j43txm,"I mean, close to 100k from Joji is his a huge W. considering the type of sound he goes for. Something like “Run” is more mainstream but the album in general is still quite an alternative sound, hard to see him selling more than that tbh, could potentially push 150k with his next album but If he stays true to his sound, I doubt he’s doing much more"
4466,2020-10-04 00:19:16,j43txm,Yes. Lol
4467,2020-10-03 03:01:15,j43txm,Honestly
4468,2020-10-03 14:03:47,j43txm,Lol smh
4469,2020-10-03 16:16:20,j43txm,"The album slaps, I don't give a fuck.

Even if he shot homegirl in her foot, 90% of y'all favourite rappers have done worse.

I still bang the Remix to Ignition."
4470,2020-10-03 06:46:37,j43txm,Why would he get front page love when this is his second drop of the year with no rollout?
4471,2020-10-04 00:18:31,j43txm,Apple Music puts 69 in my new music generated playlists.
4472,2020-10-03 05:46:14,j43txm,I think this list is for albums that chart in the top 50
4473,2020-10-03 14:42:33,j43txm,Probably just not your vibe
4474,2020-10-03 15:32:29,j43txm,"I agree, like it’s not that bad but his voice is so mediocre and boring."
4475,2020-10-03 19:17:53,j43txm,IGOR wasnt either but it used to be here.
4476,2020-10-03 15:33:00,j43txm,Nectar isn’t either
4477,2020-10-04 12:01:16,j43txm,It’s an album by a rapper. That’s the only criteria.
4478,2020-10-02 23:58:56,j43txm,This is a certified epic reddit moment 👍
4479,2020-10-02 23:53:13,j43txm,simply epic
4480,2020-10-05 02:22:22,j43txm,destroyed him so hard he got a #1 album yea 👍
4481,2020-10-05 19:16:30,j43txm,This is like a youtube tier comment I didn't think I would see it here lmao.
4482,2020-10-03 11:32:37,j43txm,"Apparently, he didn't destroy him lol"
4483,2020-10-03 03:07:45,j43txm,"did testing really have a huge rollout? my memory might be fucked but from what i remember the whole thing was fucked from the beginning with them releasing singles that weren’t from the album (that blocboy and gucci song) and postponing it like a million times, then kinda dropping it last minute (in the middle of the pusha/drake beef)     
iirc it didn’t even have physical copies (CDs/vinyls) either when it first got released"
4484,2020-10-03 03:18:47,j43txm,"Tbh ROTD3’s success was mostly because of Cole, Under The Sun and Middle Child especially."
4485,2020-10-03 20:53:05,j43txm,Rocky is still really famous like everyone knows who he is and girls still talk about him but yah I barely hear his shit being played anymore
4486,2020-10-03 18:15:23,j43txm,"While Testing had a big rollout, I think it was due to being such a disjointed press run that was seen as weird, such as the performance in the box at Sotheby's (?), not to mention the Soundcloud tracks having little to no real impact and honestly negative reception from here because they felt lazy. A factor too was lazy merch, which I'm guessing significantly impacted merch sales, especially since his fanbase isn't one that will rabidly buy anything with his name. Not only that, but there was also the whole Pusha T Drake beef that completely overshadowed his rollout, along with Push dropping his album the same day with a lot of momentum. I love Testing, but it's press run wasn't great."

4494,2020-10-03 01:26:53,j43txm,"14yos who used to say the n word would probably say something like “Joji needs to go back to FilthyFrank, his music sucks now”"
4495,2020-10-02 23:59:35,j43txm,I think there was just a huge untapped market for this blink 182 type throwback stuff
4496,2020-10-03 16:08:04,j43txm,"As someone who has loosely followed MGK from the beginning, it’s baffling to see how far he’s come.

4497,2020-10-03 00:19:01,j43txm,Most the people I know playing this new album are people who didn’t listen to MGK before

4504,2020-10-03 04:05:28,j43txm,It’s not even rap-rock. It’s just straight up pop-punk album. If you just listened to it without knowing you wouldn’t really guess he’s a rapper
4505,2020-10-03 09:30:04,j43txm,it’s not rap rock btw. it’s legit a pop punk album.
4506,2020-10-03 00:26:47,j43txm,Mgk to goat status lmao what a joke
4507,2020-10-02 23:25:16,j43txm,GOAT in what genre tho? Cause he suffered a pretty nasty kill shot in rap that he still hasn’t recovered from.

4509,2020-10-03 01:07:11,j43txm,Wtf i like YG and I am just now learning he dropped an album
4510,2020-10-03 02:09:16,j43txm,Yeah judging by how last year's album went I would argue under 30k for him. Even with Go Loko getting pretty huge (certified platinum single) it still only carried 4Real 4Real to 37k week one.
4511,2020-10-03 16:09:17,j43txm,And its very good! I love the new YG

Figure he get some love

Guess that shows the bubble we live here on hhh"

4518,2020-10-09 13:29:29,j43txm,Eminem to me is like Spongebob. I still call it the greatest show but I'm only counting first 3 seasons pre-Spongebob movie. I only count Eminem up to Recovery or MMLP2 at the most. Now he's just an old pedo looking dude and I don't put that against him.

4522,2020-10-02 23:24:29,j43txm,"Eh I mean it's not terrible but I don't think it's *very* impressive since he already had the benefit of building that loyal fanbase while on a major label, those fans don't just disappear when you go independant. It would be a tonne more impressive if he was some up and comer."
4523,2020-10-03 00:45:38,j43txm,not very impressive at all come on
4524,2020-10-03 01:18:50,j43txm,Yea I just listened at first because I was curious what was up with him. After that I didn’t really care lol
4525,2020-10-03 03:23:24,j43txm,"Lol ok I'll see you in the next sales thread next time he drops then, surely he'll do 100k with no major label for promo, major features or controversy"

tory has never been a big hitmaker, and thats going to be even harder for him to do now with no major label to push them to radio and spotify playlists"
4527,2020-10-03 15:02:35,j43txm,"Chris Brown didn't release another album until 2011, he had the backing of RCA and the industry. He also admitted guilty and plead guilty (after getting a sweethearted deal albeit).

I Can Transform You dropped 7 months after the incident, three months after he plead guilty and could start apologizing to the fullest extent. He had the backing of RCA to take a full blown apology tour at a time that people didn't really want celebrities to go away if they did something bad. The concept that Chris Brown would just go away and not come back was completely foreign to the public. They didn't get to choose what they listened to as much it was just the radio.

Then in 2013, he was back with Rihanna so nothing mattered."
4528,2020-10-03 03:20:28,j43txm,Chris Brown was a mega star in the making who dropped to A- tier. Tory was already B list and he’s gonna drop to C list probably.
4529,2020-10-02 23:03:03,j43txm,Hope meg sees this bro💀💀🤡🤡
4530,2020-10-02 23:40:16,j43txm,"I think there's a difference between living a lifestyle that many feel trapped into by poverty, systemic racism and lack of opportunities, and just an already rich celebrity shooting an innocent, unarmed woman for no real reason, and then making gaslighting: the album about it. That's not to say either are okay, but I can see why people would be more turned off by what Tory did.

Also I'm not exactly clear with what 21 Savage has actually done and been charged with or accused of, do you know exactly what he's done? Because I don't think it's fair to assume every single bar of his is accurate to things he's personally done in his life, rappers lie or exaggerate all the time."
4531,2020-10-03 15:17:05,j43txm,"21 savage hasn't done crime (or been caught at least) since he blew up. the only thing he's actually been charged with is like drug possession. 

he's a success story, kid makes it out of a tough situation and gives back to his community and shit

also those shootouts and robberies he raps about are with other gang members.

whether this is fair or not, it's not much different from serving in the military vs shooting a civilian. people excuse serving in the military because:

- ignorance about what the military is doing, blind patriotism
- economic benefit

hot take but not too different here except the allegiance is to a gang."
4532,2020-10-03 02:00:40,j43txm,What did 21 do? You do realize if rappers did exactly what they dropped about they'd probably be shot down by a swat team right?

Are y’all rlly the type to talk abt morals? Like, yes the idiot shot a bitch in her foot, but so fucking what. I don’t even like Tory, couldn’t name single song he’s made, no joke. But what the fuck is the hypocrisy? Y’all are in no place to judge rappers in terms of morals lmao, either you crucify them all, or you needa shut the fuck up"
4534,2020-10-03 16:28:42,j43txm,"""bitch nigga."""
4535,2020-10-03 07:02:31,j43txm,"well it’s Tory lanez, he’s a huge artist he doesn’t really need a huge roll out to justify it. Plus, they didn’t even put his album in the “New Music” section. They legit gave him the 6ix9ine treatment and hid it from everywhere but his artist page."
4536,2020-10-04 01:14:10,j43txm,I saw it too and yea that’s a fair point. He’s not completely blacklisted then.
4537,2020-10-03 05:47:10,j43txm,lmaoooo anywhere to see the fulll list?
4538,2020-10-03 14:45:03,j43txm,"I mean, I like a lot of classic pop punk. This is just a terrible attempt at it"
4539,2020-10-03 03:28:30,j43txm,"One of those was a promotional single but the others were tracks thrown on soundcloud. I'm mainly talking about from releasing ASAP Forever and from there - the single and video dropped the same day he performed it on Fallon. After that there was shit popping up all over social media covered in that circle crash test dummy logo thing.

I don't really remember much about postponing the album. From what I could find online he said he was planning on dropping 'sometime in May' back in January that year but you could be right about that. As for the Drake/Pusha thing it's more like he dropped as it started cause I remember Testing come out the same day Daytona did."
4540,2020-10-03 14:50:10,j43txm,"there were a handful of soundcloud singles.

it was a weird rollout, they kept slow rolling the release date"
4541,2020-10-03 10:39:39,j43txm,It had a huge rollout. I remember he did some weird livestream and that yellow and black loog was everywhere
4542,2020-10-03 14:50:20,j43txm,"there were a handful of soundcloud singles.

it was a weird rollout, they kept slow rolling the release date"
4543,2020-10-03 14:50:41,j43txm,"there were a handful of soundcloud singles.

it was a weird rollout, they kept slow rolling the release date"
4544,2020-10-03 08:11:18,j43txm,Nah rotd3 generated huge buzz on its own. Cole of course will balloon the numbers but it's also not as if Cole does Drake type numbers on the billboard charts
4545,2020-10-03 13:16:01,j43txm,"I’m not trying to be an asshole but you either are trolling or didn’t listen back then and somehow managed to get every single thing wrong in your comment.

Ok first of all trap had absolutely dominated the mainstream for at least 5 years. In no way, shape or form would anyone ever use the term “swirling around Atlanta at the time” to describe trap music past 2002.

Rocky was the one who changed the game. In no way at all was anyone considering anything Rocky did to have been done before. No one and I truly mean *no one* in NY was making music even remotely close to what Rocky was making. If anything he was one of the first people to bring trap out of the south. Before Rocky every single trap rapper you’d hear was from the south."
4546,2020-10-03 01:53:36,j43txm,"As someone who practices self-harm by scrolling through YouTube comment sections, this is extremely accurate"
4547,2020-10-03 00:01:07,j43txm,"Pure sales tell me it was his fans buying it, same thing with joji"
4548,2020-10-03 03:01:02,j43txm,As a white man in his 30s yes this is true this and Tony Hawk brought my childhood back
4549,2020-10-03 08:53:24,j43txm,Im here for this revival.
4550,2020-10-03 17:16:18,j43txm,The only song I've heard from his album is the on on the THPS 1+2 soundtrack and honestly I kinda like it lmao
4551,2020-10-05 01:45:50,j43txm,I found out about MGK when he performed Invincible at Wrestlemania in 2012 and I’ve been hooked ever since.
4552,2020-10-03 00:23:52,j43txm,Oh i might be wrong idk. I used to be an mgk fan and his base has always been super die hard
4553,2020-10-03 02:55:14,j43txm,"I honestly didn't know he was making this type of music until I heard it on the remastered tony hawk, but I dig it"
4554,2020-10-03 11:57:45,j43txm,"I haven't listened to an MGK album since Lace Up and the Eminem drama. That being said, his Blink182 b sides cover album was fun."
4555,2020-10-03 11:29:48,j43txm,"He's been active for a decade and is still going upwards. His numbers were low because many people slept on him, Lace Up, GA, and Hotel Diablo were something special."
4556,2020-10-03 02:13:16,j43txm,"Yeah, he'll never be the greatest or anything but he does good stuff"
4557,2020-10-03 03:02:42,j43txm,"prolly just saying this because i’ve never really liked his music so i already have a negative bias of him, but just because mgk has a lot of connections and does a variety of things doesn’t mean the things he does is amazing, i’ve seen his acting, i’ve heard his rap shit, i’ve  heard his pop-punk shit and I think everything he does is like whatever one tier above mediocre is. Like if you were to compare MGK and Childish Gambino, both have done multiple styles of music and both act but Donald Glover is someone I would say is doing amazing things and I don’t think MGK is anywhere close to being as talented as him."
4558,2020-10-03 18:06:36,j43txm,"Everything he's released besides Binge has been solid, this sub hates him but he's talented. Hotel Diablo and General Admission are good hip hop albums and TTMDF is a fun pop punk album. My guess is half the people who hate on him haven't actually listened to much of his stuff."
4559,2020-10-03 04:29:57,j43txm,"But I don’t think any pop punk fans listened to it tho, I’m talking about bears target audience and even tho is tape only sold 23k, he has 24 million listeners on Spotify so the audience is there, it’s more casual listeners than anything"
4560,2020-10-04 15:39:03,j43txm,"Can tell you first hand blackbear style is kinda the ""reincarnation"" of the popb punk that was in the past, generally share the same audience aswell. People like me, who just about grew up when pop punk was still mainstream but not as big as it used to be, listen nowadays to musicians like blackbear but if we were born a bit earlier we would've listened to pop punk. However mgk also had the audience from the rap side so you add it all up..."
4561,2020-10-03 04:30:16,j43txm,Yeah exactly like for the teenage mainstream
4562,2020-10-03 17:38:04,j43txm,I don't want to listen to that either
4563,2020-10-04 14:26:49,j43txm,I heard you the first time. no need to repeat yourself
4564,2020-10-03 01:09:49,j43txm,This sub is wild
4565,2020-10-03 11:27:23,j43txm,"2019 and 2020 were his strongest years so apparently, he did recover."
4566,2020-10-02 23:46:00,j43txm,[deleted]
4567,2020-10-03 03:48:25,j43txm,I actually liked it better than 21s album too.
4568,2020-10-03 04:28:14,j43txm,"I genuinely don't understand YGs numbers. Spotify stream counts has him way higher than even tyler the creator (approximately tied when igor dropped, tyler much lower now), but despite 4real 4real having multiple songs I constantly heard in clubs it only sold 37k. 

I don't know how someone can simultaneously be so big and not do numbers. I expect this album to not do numbers, but if clubs were going I would expect it to be big again because it's got some great hits in it"
4569,2020-10-03 01:11:40,j43txm,"Man idk. I think the fact that Bryson been gone for so long is a big factor here. 

Big Sean was just under the top Kendrick Drake Cole tier in the early 2000s. Being gone for half a decade, he put out a high quality project, not to mention features from Travis, Thug, Wayne, Ty$, Eminem, Anderson Paak, Jhene, Nipsey Hussle, *Stevie Wonder, and Dave Chappelle* and couldn't even outsell Gunna. 

I wont be surprised if 21 has high streaming numbers for a few days but I have my doubts how much it'll last the week. 

Tbf I don't know shit I'm just talking out of my ass"
4570,2020-10-03 01:52:10,j43txm,He was only top 12 because apple music wasnt registering the savagexboomin songs. It's not there anymore but still may do that number with savage doing way more
4571,2020-10-03 16:40:40,j43txm,My Crazy Life and Still Brazy are very good albums. The latter being great and very unique for being a G-Funk throwback. After these YGs album game declined and he became a singles guy.
4572,2020-10-03 06:50:58,j43txm,"Mr Wonderful saw 43k first week. 

Also had that Chance single tho, whereas Dolphins had no big singles imo"
4573,2020-10-03 19:06:37,j43txm,he's a bigger celeb in areas outside of music. He has over 1 mil followers on ig but a lot of fans gained from doing his food shows
4574,2020-10-03 06:56:21,j43txm,"Yeah, I also find that popheads live in the bubble too. Look if your song even once entered top 100 on bilboard and did not go up it just means that people do not like it that much, not that it is not marketed or pushed enough"
4575,2020-10-03 01:03:48,j43txm,"Well considering that ASAP Ferg, an artist with *some* pedigree, didn’t even move 10k (while having major label backing AND a Nicki feature) I’d say Torys numbers standout quite a bit (despite the aforementioned controversies surrounding the album)."
4576,2020-10-03 15:12:58,j43txm,"i think he could definitely sell more than this but im gonna need to see his next couple album sales before 100k is in the question

in the off chance that he's completely exonerated he could probably sell a decent amount. he might want to sign to a label if that happens."
4577,2020-10-03 00:01:54,j43txm,"Good point, but a lot of people dont even think tory did it (even tho he clearly did)"
4578,2020-10-03 00:02:35,j43txm,It ain't even like that. Tory shot Meg. I don't want anybody shooting another artist. I'd say the same if she shot him the fuck
4579,2020-10-03 01:57:19,j43txm,Hope Tory sees this man. He's just the right height to suck your dick standing too!
4580,2020-10-03 00:55:57,j43txm,Call your mum and say sorry bro
4581,2020-10-02 23:59:40,j43txm,[deleted]
4582,2020-10-04 22:38:12,j43txm,wait it seems like you're agreeing with him? lol
4583,2020-10-03 05:48:39,j43txm,"No idea, honestly"
4584,2020-10-03 14:46:30,j43txm,I disagree. I think it really captures the spirit and energy of it and songs like lonely and play when I’m gone are full of emotion.
4585,2020-10-03 08:41:51,j43txm,I think it was mainly because of all the outside artists they were bringing in during the sessions that they’d post on social media
4586,2020-10-03 01:56:46,j43txm,Comments on music videos are worse than ever. Half of them are stale memes and half of them are “flexing” on Tik Tok users
4587,2020-10-03 00:10:52,j43txm,"Yes but that's not to understate the amount of fans he's gained by switching genres. I've seen him gain a lot of hype with my friends since Hotel Diablo, all rock fans who would never have heard his music if not for that Yungblud song."
4588,2020-10-05 23:05:16,j43txm,Idk I hate MGK but I put the money down for the deluxe vinyl lol
4589,2020-10-03 10:34:30,j43txm,"I didn't even like Blink or other pop-punk the first time around (didn't hate it either, just didn't speak to me), but it was so prevalent and such a background sound that a lot of the kids were listening to that bringing it back makes me feel nostalgic as fuck and I actually vibe with it now"
4590,2020-10-03 04:59:19,j43txm,Lol you’re the only person comparing Donald Glover to MGK.
4591,2020-10-03 20:40:25,j43txm,"Bloom isn't great. It has a few good tracks on it, but it really takes the weakest elements of both General Admission and Hotel Diablo."
4592,2020-10-03 13:46:39,j43txm,I mean i get what you mean but i have to disagree. r/poppunkers seemed to [actually like the album](https://www.reddit.com/r/poppunkers/comments/izbp74/new_album_machine_gun_kelly_tickets_to_my_downfall/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)
4593,2020-10-03 15:24:58,j43txm,a lot of people i know who were big pop punk fans like the new mgk album
4594,2020-10-05 04:58:32,j43txm,Hot Girl Bummer is the main reason for his Spotify stream count.
4595,2020-10-10 07:52:47,j43txm,I'm not too into blackbear. Was a LEGO Bionicle fan in elementary school and they made me fans of pop-punk All-American Rejects so this album was super enjoyable throwback
4596,2020-10-03 17:40:46,j43txm,I mean that’s fair. We’re on a hip hop sub so it’s definitely not the style of music catered to that lol. Just pointing out it’s in no way a rap fusion album.
4597,2020-10-03 10:37:42,j43txm,">One guy with 42 downvotes

>This sub"
4598,2020-10-03 11:39:39,j43txm,"he’s talking about in rap, he got ethered so bad he had to switch genres"
4599,2020-10-03 11:26:52,j43txm,"I mean the last time Eminem dropped something with the impact of ""Glass House"" was in 2010. Hotel Diablo was slept on, ignore these people who never even bothered to listen to it."
4600,2020-10-02 23:48:37,j43txm,"Such a weird thing is happening... i grr up with Eminem, but I’m feeling sus about those diss tracks now 🧐"

4604,2020-10-03 04:32:47,j43txm,Singles vs albums Artist
4605,2020-10-03 01:30:23,j43txm,"Nah you are more accurate imo with your prediction. No lead single leading up to the album, 10 tracks. Unless the drake feature carries half his sales, 70k looks optimistic and I say this as a hardcore Tiller fan. I would love 70k and anything better would be a welcome surprise"
4606,2020-10-03 19:07:03,j43txm,i think if you're an independent artist that won't apply
4607,2020-10-03 14:55:56,j43txm,"tory is way more popular than ferg.

way way way before all of this"
4608,2020-10-03 01:18:56,j43txm,"Tory has always sold more than ferg (who has never been a high seller, peaked around 30k), so it would make sense that even after going independant that he sells more since he's been consistently been releasing albums and before all this, was on a trend upwards popularity wise, meanwhile ferg hadn't dropped an album since 2017 and released a sequel to an EP people already didn't care about or really enjoy. Nicki is also past her prime and a feature from her when the song is already released is not going to help sales in any meaningful way, only thing she's good for popularity wise is to get the barbs to flock to a single to get it at a high debut before it free falls the week after.

Like they're definitely not bad numbers, but not particularly wow-worthy given the size of his fanbase imo."
4609,2020-10-03 00:03:16,j43txm,"the only people that genuinely believe he didn't do it are his diehard fans, which i agree will continue to support him as long as he puts out music that they think is good, but I think the trajectory of his career overall is pretty fucked up."
4610,2020-10-03 00:33:42,j43txm,">(even tho he clearly did)

*Clearly?*

Based on what exactly? Some statements from one side?

Wonder if you'll expect anyone to come to your side if you're ever accused of something by a woman."
4611,2020-10-03 01:19:39,j43txm,We shouldn’t be shooting anyone first off unless it’s self defense
4612,2020-10-03 07:53:58,j43txm,No evidence what‘s so hard to understand about that

Did i hurt your feelings or sumn?💀💀"
4614,2020-10-03 01:20:48,j43txm,Idk man look at Bobby Shmurda or whatever that dudes name is
4615,2020-10-04 23:40:51,j43txm,"Only with his second sentence, I haven’t actually played the album"
4616,2020-10-03 00:12:45,j43txm,I didnt follow the release that closely but did this reall show up on rock fans radar? I figured it would be like when most rappers switch genres for an album and its mostly still rap fans listening. For instance trippie got a rock album coming and i would assume mostly rap fans will be the ones listening to it cause its trippie
4617,2020-10-03 13:48:09,j43txm,I feel the exact same lol I always thought I was too cool for that music when I was in middle/high school but now it just makes me feel nostalgic as fuck and I actually love hearing it
4618,2020-10-03 05:49:42,j43txm,"People here get such a hard on for dudes who make their way into the mainstream and make some sort of social commentary on the way. In what world are Donald Glover and MGK even related? What point are they even trying to make? Yes MGK didnt make a show like Atlanta... Neither have 99% of entertainers lol

If the bar for ""talent"" is Donald Glover's career then there wouldn't be a market for like 95% of the hip hop industry lmao."
4619,2020-10-03 13:56:02,j43txm,"Yes, I brought up Donald Glover as an example because the person I was replying to said MGK was doing amazing things because he raps, makes rock music, and acts. I said I don’t think he’s doing amazing things because there’s someone else who does almost the exact same thing but is better at all of those than MGK, that’s someone I would say is doing amazing things."
4620,2020-10-03 20:42:56,j43txm,"I agree with you, I always forget about Bloom because I didn't personally enjoy it that much. I don't think it was necessarily a bad album, just too poppy for me."
4621,2020-10-03 13:47:49,j43txm,"Oh fr? Didn’t know that, I don’t know pop punk like I haven’t listened to it but I heard people say it was basic, but if they do then it’s good for him"
4622,2020-10-03 21:12:50,j43txm,"Thanks for pointing that out. I thought it was a fusion album because I went to his Christmas EST concert the year he put out Binge so i was thinking it would be a rap concert, then he starts playing guitar out of nowhere. He smashes the guitar halfway through the set and I'm like ""thank god"" until 5 minutes later he pulls out ANOTHER fucking guitar. I wanted to leave"
4623,2020-10-03 21:40:49,j43txm,"I feel like this sub hasn’t been a hiphop sub for 6-7 years, it’s mostly just pop/emo/mumble rap focused now."

4631,2020-10-03 15:07:27,j43txm,"He would've been better off staying quiet and waiting for the trial.

then in the off chance he's innocent, he can parade around that he's innocent and act like he's emmitt till.

and if it's revealed that he definitely did something bad (whether or not he literally shot at megan in the ""dance bitch"" story or it was something lesser), he could do a full blown apology tour. if it's lesser than what people assume, that would really help.

obviously it's gonna be hard no matter what because he's been abandoned by the industry because he's not label supported. a decent number of artists will start collabing with him eventually tho because nobody cares about anything."

Idk why people keep reducing this whole thing to meg just saying he shot me and Tory saying no I didn't as if both sides have produced equally compelling arguments"

4637,2020-10-03 00:35:13,j43txm,"Yungblud is somewhat of a rising name in rock and Travis Barker is arguably a legend at this point, so yeah it actually was able to pull some interest from rock fans and it took off since it's a pretty good song."

4649,2020-10-04 00:19:57,j43txm,yeah which is more like people actually like your song and you can chalk up to not having marketing to push your music higher
4650,2020-10-03 04:10:42,j43txm,"I don't think you know what gaslighting even means. 

Beyond that, staying silent and letting the courts figure shit out is the best possible thing you can do, especially in 2020. Talking to police or media (which is the equivalent) would be beyond stupid. 

A woman can get pregnant. Show a positive test and an ultrasound and clearly say you were the only man she was fucking. Still doesn't mean it's yours. 

I pray you don't ever end up on a jury. People on these far left biased subreddits just have zero sense. The replies here are evidence. Anyone who disagrees with the hivemind is an Incel, misogynist, racist blah blah blah.

Despite what your echo chamber will tell you, false accusations ain't that uncommon. Studies have shown up to 8% of sexual assault reports are false. But facts are scary to this movement.

All you did was show she was shot. That doesn't show any evidence he was the one that did it. Where's all the witnesses? They weren't alone that night and nobody is speaking. You're the one making insane leaps here. Right now it's a he said she said case, and yeah you really think the burden of evidence shifts to Tory. Ridiculous. That's not how our justice systems have worked and it's not how they should. Unless you want our prison systems to become filled with innocent men."

When it was finally released after a lot of the hype had died, it was just generally worse. Different vocals, different snare, horns sounded weaker.  Ended up flying under the sub's radar with ~40 upvotes, mostly negative comments, was quickly forgotten.

4679,2020-10-02 13:11:32,j3enud,"I still like Shellz 😬 I think my main problem with the song as a whole from a DJ perspective is its a 1 drop type song....there literally no reason to play it out beyond 58 seconds. Great for a hype song in a set, but there's really no reason to drop it in the club or play it out in its entirety."

Nit Grit falling out with the industry after being the king of SoundCloud back in the day.  He’s back to producing but that one bums me out the most.  

Mimosa throwing a tantrum on stage and pouring vodka all over the next DJ up.  His career imploded at that moment.  

In general:  Any producer not releasing a live set they’ve done on their SoundCloud.  IMO this is the best way to get people stoked to come see you play.

Gladiator... what happened to these guys?!  By far and away my favorite trap producers and they just kinda disappeared... Sad."

4729,2020-11-09 13:26:15,jqxgh6,"How are you measuring success? 

Make the music you want to hear more than anything. Artistic integrity is worth way more than money or fame."
4730,2020-11-09 15:36:42,jqxgh6,"You're only 23. It does get harder when we're older but you're not even past 30 yet, so just keep working."
4731,2020-11-09 14:37:31,jqxgh6,"This is a really good post. Self-imposed limitations (made up beliefs) prevent people from expressing themselves authentically all the time in all aspects of their lives. The only one holding yourself back from success is always yourself and your beliefs about what is possible. When you decide that the feeling you get when doing what you are passionate about is more important than success, you succeed."
4732,2020-11-09 15:47:53,jqxgh6,Shit I'm turning 25 this month and I'm having the same crisis. Got a degree in Sound Design and I've been making music since I was a kid. Now I work in a factory with no outlook on a career in audio/music.
4733,2020-11-09 16:59:11,jqxgh6,"I remember seeing this clip from this interview of James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem. He touches a lot on his ideas of failure in the music industry. He makes some great points about how age can factor into those feelings, too. This interview always makes me feel better.

https://youtu.be/yYCz06bS380"
4734,2020-11-10 08:45:38,jqxgh6,"23, I'm not saying you're a kid still, but you need some perspective on what old is. You're only just beginning to figure out who you are and what you want. I am a totally different person than I was when I was 23, and at 23, I was a totally different person than I was when I was 18. The next few years are going to change you so much, and if they don't, something's wrong.

I'm not discounting everything you know about yourself and what you want so far, and I'm certainly not telling you you're wrong about yourself (I'm just a guy on the internet, you know you), music will obviously be a huge part of your life, but I promise there is more you have yet to uncover.

My point with the above is simply to tell you that even though you might feel like this is it (in many different aspects of life), 20 to 30 is probably the period where you will do the most death and rebirth of yourself in your life. I feel like every year I was a different person and it's only now starting to level out a little. I know everyone is different but people also aren't that different and I was a 23 year old overthinker at one point too.

I'm 31 dude and I don't even consider myself old. Don't compare yourself to popular figures, or anyone for that matter. The only person you should be comparing yourself to is the you you were yesterday.

It's likely that those arists got incredibly lucky and were picked up by a label with the full weight of a professional promo team and a bunch of money behind them. I don't know if that's the case for all of them but there are so many different circumstances you may not be aware of that contributed to their success, and remember that you are only seeing the success side of things, and even that is filtered through agents and managers and PR reps. Everything comes with a cost, there is nothing free in this life. What looks great from the outside might be hell on the inside.

Just focus on your craft and keep pushing forward. It has been my experience that slow and steady does tend to win the race, even if the runner spends quite a bit of time wondering when the fuck this will finally pay off. 

Every great success I ever heard speak about their journey didn't have a plan b either. The safe road is usually pretty fucking disappointing, but the dangerous road is pretty fucking dangerous, life sucks that way, we didn't choose it and it only gets harder.

That being said, you might as well give it your all. Drive 2 hours for a 10 minute spot, stay up late, buy that thing you need, figure it out, make it happen or it never will. If you honestly think you have something special, never stop moving forward with it, and never give up, and if it doesn't happen, hopefully you had some fun, learned a shit load, and most importantly, you won't have any nagging regrets.

Everything is preparing you for the next thing, it helps me to remember that in times of hardship.

Edit: refined my thoughts a few times."
4735,2020-11-09 13:39:45,jqxgh6,"Whatever happens, you don't have to give up on the thing you love the most. It all depends on what you mean by success, but if the reason you're doing is only to get super popular then maybe rethink it? There is a huge chance of getting disappointed. If it doesn't stop you from working and making money for living why does it matter? It makes you happy so keep doing it."
4736,2020-11-09 13:56:29,jqxgh6,I was friendly with one of the biggest tech house producer / DJs in the world for a time and he told me he knew of a chef in his forties who was coming through in his scene. 23 isn't past it by any stretch.

4739,2020-11-09 16:25:24,jqxgh6,"I think the issue is young musicians stand out more

Try to take note or make a list of musicians who made it big when they were older

Off the top of my head

Sufjan Stevens,
Justin Vernon (Bon Iver),
Elliott Smith,
Jeff Buckley

Those guys made it big in their mid to late 20s"
4740,2020-11-09 20:31:41,jqxgh6,"You need to start looking at the artists who made it when they were older. I like to think about James Murphy from LCD Soundsystem when I feel discouraged by my age. He didn't make it until he was 33. 

Another one is Michael Gira from Swans (who had a successful band when he was younger), but he didn't make the Seer until he was in his 50s, and that album made him way more successful and he went on to make 2 more absolutely incredible albums after that.

Also the Radiohead guys made it when they were only a bit older than you, but they didn't release what I consider their best material until they were mid 30s.

I know the second 2 are my opinions but I think these are great ways to think if you don't want to let your age discourage you. You have your entire life to become what you want to be. Which is like 10x longer than the 6 years you've been trying to make it as an artist. You won't even be 30 yet when you've worked on stuff twice as long as you have lol."
4741,2020-11-10 09:40:20,jqxgh6,"Take advantage of your university network, the campus radio station might be more useful than you expect. Also the social network of college might be helpful.  And wear sunscreen/take care of your health now."
4742,2020-11-15 16:22:51,jqxgh6,I'm also 23 but less successful than you. I have never  released an album. I also started at the age of 17. I thought I would very successful by 23 but I didn't achieve that level of success I thought I would get. I'm still hoping one day I would be successful like my idols or even more successful than them. I just have to figure out how can I do that.
4743,2020-11-29 11:53:20,jqxgh6,"This post couldn’t come at a better time. Turned 23 during the early part of November and I’m bout to go for University soon since my country places a huge emphasis on paper. Need it for a backup plan, but I’m still thinking of achieving success with my music."
4744,2020-11-09 13:34:49,jqxgh6,"Cut off age to get signed to a major label is 28 (As an artist/poster boy)

No such thing exists for producers, though. Or writers.

4746,2020-11-09 16:10:30,jqxgh6,Nobody likes you at that age anyway.

4748,2020-11-09 16:03:26,jqxgh6,Yup he was working at a pizzeria right before zach invited him to form death grips.
4749,2020-11-09 16:05:26,jqxgh6,"Yeah I definitely want to move forward again. It's just that I'm very weak as an entrepreneur, so the freelance life isn't for me. Jobs are very hard to find, especially now with Covid."

definitely putting that in the area of my brain where i store musicians who made it big later in life to make me feel better"
4751,2020-11-10 09:05:49,jqxgh6,"I feel you, right now everything is on hold. But maybe after all this you can get in on the ground floor, maybe it'll end up opening up opportunities.

One thing I'd suggest is to look for jobs that are even remotely related to music. Sweep floors at a venue or studio, work at a music store, anything that will get you closer to that world. You never know who you might meet, maybe you work at guitar center and talk to a guy who owns a studio and is looking to hire. Just try and get yourself in and around music in your professional life so there's a greater chance of making the right connections."

4755,2020-11-09 05:35:54,jqru15,"You say this like this season has been weaker? Personally this season has been one of the best so far imo, and these last 2 episodes were 2 of the best episodes back to back imo."
4756,2020-11-09 08:38:39,jqru15,Idk why but the stage manager blowing his brains out made me lose it.
4757,2020-11-09 06:06:13,jqru15,"Stronger than 1-2 but weaker than 3-4. The levar burton cameo was amazing, and the interviews were great (minus Naya Rivera’s but it makes sense that they made her’s more respectful). Pranks were meh"
4758,2020-11-09 06:06:09,jqru15,This season is dope.  Also Brenda Song is adorable
4759,2020-11-09 09:13:04,jqru15,"I fucking love this season. It has shattered the meta and confirmed that the only consistent thing about the show is its inconsistency and chaos. The new hyper-psychedelic set, the Japanese band, the rotating co-hosts... it's complete madness. 

Hannibal will be missed but he was clearly done being on the show and would therefore have brought it down even if he was somehow made to be a part of it. 

I'm personally really loving the change and am excited for the show's future, and that's coming from someone who basically has had this show on repeat for the last six years of my life."
4760,2020-11-09 12:53:31,jqru15,"I had no idea that Naya Rivera was the person who drowned earlier this year while watching so to see the tribute at the end was very surprising and heavy. Kinda weird to see that she did this show probably not too long before tragically dying. 

They probably cut her appearance so short because they didn't want one of her last appearances on a show ever to show her being super uncomfortable."
4761,2020-11-09 06:54:09,jqru15,Season has been weaker but episode 6 was the funniest so far
4762,2020-11-09 11:41:09,jqru15,"Just finished watching and completely missed Lil Nas X, when was that?"

4764,2020-11-10 20:39:09,jqru15,Pranks like the Mafia one are among my favorites. I also just realized how the band members switch places every now and then.
4765,2020-11-09 05:37:24,jqru15,idk i just miss hannibal man😔
4766,2020-11-09 11:43:39,jqru15,it was in the end of episode 5. he was reacting to that girl getting tortured like in those japanese game shows
4767,2020-11-10 05:59:21,jqru15,he promoted the wrong episode
4768,2020-11-09 06:14:49,jqru15,"I do too 😔 none of the co hosts have been able to reach even close to his heights, but I think Eric has been doing great on his own, and the multiple co hosts that come in some episodes have still been really funny imo. Hannibal was truly a loss though."
4769,2020-11-09 11:44:54,jqru15,"Hahaha just went back and saw that, good spot"
4770,2020-11-16 01:42:55,jqru15,"That girl is Grimes, a rather popular musician, aka Elon Musk's Baby Momma.   That must have been filled very early during her pregnancy."
4771,2020-11-09 08:26:28,jqqrgx,So is it Santa Nas X or Lil Claus X ?
4772,2020-11-09 11:19:27,jqqrgx,pretty nice beat he got there
4773,2020-11-09 07:25:22,jqqrgx,"Help!!! WHAT is that “hey!” female shout at the beginning of the song? It’s in Juice WRLD’s ‘Bad Energy,’ in Dua Lipa’s ‘Good in Bed’ (I believe)...does anyone know where it’s sampled from? It almost sounds like Bad Blood, but I highly, highly doubt that it is. (Also this is impossible to google)."
4774,2020-11-09 04:28:34,jqqrgx,Don't really like what I hear so far but I'll have to wait for the full song to see.
4775,2020-11-09 09:28:35,jqqrgx,So there’s a Back To The Future theme in the font at the end and the third movie was in a Western setting. Then MJF says “Don’t go to 2020”. So obviously he’s going to 2020...
4776,2020-11-09 04:47:22,jqqrgx,how tf this man already has 10 mill subscribers
4777,2020-11-09 06:53:30,jqqrgx,how does a one hit wonder keep the hype after so long lol
4778,2020-11-09 13:29:36,jqqrgx,Lil Claus X for sure
4779,2020-11-09 07:29:11,jqqrgx,"All 3 of those songs have a production credit from “Take a Daytrip” so im guessing it’s their producer tag
Edit: did a little more research and it’s definitely from their producer tag: https://youtu.be/-Em8tnKrODc"

4781,2020-11-09 07:07:32,jqqrgx,He's just really likeable. I don't even like his music but still follow on twitter cause he's cute and funny
4782,2020-11-09 08:25:35,jqqrgx,"He is not a one hit wonder though. Rodeo and Panini both are multiplatinum songs over the word with the latter also being a top 5 single in US. It's hard, nearly impossible, to replicate the massive success of Old Town Road, but that doesn't make him a one hit wonder."
4783,2020-11-09 09:16:53,jqqrgx,"By releasing more songs? Panini was already a second hit for them, and arguably Rodeo too, so they aren't really a one hit wonder anymore"

4788,2020-11-09 13:32:00,jqqrgx,"Most ""One Hit Wonders"" have a 2nd hit that gets pretty high on the charts. We just don't know them because they aren't so recent. If Nas doesn't do anything else he will for sure go down as a one hit wonder. I hope he doesn't though!"
4789,2020-11-09 08:39:08,jqqrgx,"never seen panini or rodeo anywhere impactful tho, his stans try hard to make these songs seem important tho haha"
4790,2020-11-09 09:29:52,jqqrgx,They?
4791,2020-11-09 13:53:35,jqqrgx,"That's too bad, Lil Claus X sounds so much better :("

I mean, Panini hit #5 on the Billboard Hot 100, so..."
4794,2020-11-09 09:31:52,jqqrgx,I am not even a Lil Nas stan lmao. Songs don't have to be impactful to be hits.
4795,2020-11-09 12:01:55,jqqrgx,"> song has over 600 million Spotify streams

> song has over 400 million YouTube views

4796,2020-11-09 09:33:05,jqqrgx,"Yes? (Am i missing something, i don't understand the question)"
4797,2020-11-09 08:38:13,jqqrgx,"nobody did, just my opinion"
4798,2020-11-09 09:49:33,jqqrgx,Nas is just one guy.
4799,2020-11-09 09:37:32,jqqrgx,"Oh my, who hurt you? Like for real?"
4800,2020-11-09 11:54:02,jqqrgx,You can use they/them to refer to a single person.
4801,2020-11-09 11:55:02,jqqrgx,"And ""they"" can be either singular or plural, depending on the context!"
4802,2020-11-09 12:14:44,jqqrgx,It doesn’t apply here?
4803,2020-11-09 11:58:30,jqqrgx,?? And in this context it wouldnt apply...
4804,2020-11-09 12:34:05,jqqrgx,"In what way does it not apply?

Example: ""Lil Nas X is cool! I like their music.""

What about this sentence is incorrect?"
4805,2020-11-09 12:09:30,jqqrgx,"I'm not seeing anything wrong with the context here, but whatever you say chief"
4806,2020-11-09 14:28:36,jqqrgx,It would be “his”. Because “their” implies plural.
4807,2020-11-09 15:15:45,jqqrgx,"in the English language, they/them can be singular and plural 

just give it up bro, that's not a hill worth dying for"
4808,2020-11-09 19:58:11,jqqrgx,"Again, you can use they/them/their to refer to a single person. Nothing about that sentence implies that it's plural."
4809,2020-11-09 22:00:30,jqqrgx,Not in this particular sentence
4810,2020-11-09 22:00:19,jqqrgx,Yes it does omg

4873,2020-11-09 14:20:42,jqqlmu,Wym that’s exactly what the tag is but I cut off the last 2 words lol just like original comment cut off last word
4874,2020-11-09 14:01:03,jqqlmu,carti even has a 4-5 min song lol
4875,2020-11-09 14:27:44,jqqlmu,cause it's still very difficult to make an actual catchy 3min song that people wanna replay. Very few artists have been able to consistently make huge hits over 5+ years
4876,2020-11-10 07:13:13,jqqlmu,Horses just don't understand

4885,2020-11-09 16:17:17,jqqlmu,Agree
4886,2020-11-09 14:41:21,jqqlmu,"I never said 3 minutes is much, I'm just saying yall acting like it's easy to make a short catchy hit song is insane."

4888,2020-11-09 17:45:28,jqqlmu,"Y y’all downvoting him that’s a whole other verse to make it another minute longer, plus peoples attentions spans are so short nowadays that if they see 5 mins on a single they’re less likely to tune into it it’s just how it is"
4889,2020-11-09 18:54:07,jqqlmu,[deleted]
4890,2020-11-09 18:55:07,jqqlmu,"According to who, you? The reason it was played back so much was because people felt it was unfinished and the hook was so catchy they had to play it again. That’s the whole trick it employed to rack up streams"
4891,2020-11-09 18:57:14,jqqlmu,[deleted]
4892,2020-11-09 19:04:20,jqqlmu,"Once again, how is making a song shorter or leaving a verse out worse. That’s just personal preference. [Also u can see that in streaming era the artist is paid once 30 seconds is hit on Spotify, or it counts as a stream at least. so, as they state people are more likely to just tune into the entirety of a 1:30 song than a 5 min song](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2019/5/28/18642978/music-streaming-spotify-song-length-distribution-production-switched-on-pop-vergecast-interview)
Anything else you’d like me to make up?"
4893,2020-11-09 06:17:56,jqqime,That was awesome! And Marty's right. Don't go to 2020. 😅
4894,2020-11-09 06:21:40,jqqime,Oh my god Michael! He’s in the part! YESSS
4895,2020-11-09 18:55:38,jqqime,This warmed my heart to see Michael J. Fox again.
4896,2020-11-09 18:55:21,jqqime,Fantastic Cameo...I was expecting Doc...Got Marty!
4897,2020-11-09 04:40:10,jqqime,I also think that this takes place is Hill Valley 1885. You can see the blacksmith shop in this photo here: [Blacksmith shop](https://twitter.com/supermaddix64/status/1325659197543997447?s=21)
4898,2020-11-09 17:23:18,jqqime,"I literally just watched BTTF 3 last night and woke up to this announcement, haha. I can't wait for the full single!"
4899,2020-11-09 15:49:37,jqqime,YESSSSSS
4900,2020-11-09 20:04:38,jqqime,That really made my day
4901,2020-11-09 16:54:12,jqqime,That song is gonna be #1 Trending on YouTube when it comes out. I’m sure of it.
4902,2020-11-09 08:20:16,jqqime,Spectacular cameo
4903,2020-11-09 20:06:38,jqqime,Me too!
4904,2020-11-09 04:44:18,jqqime,I think that’s just a random blacksmith’s shop. The original 1885 Hill Valley set was destroyed in the ‘90s after it burned down in a fire sparked by a lightning strike.
4905,2020-11-09 04:45:00,jqqime,I’m not saying it’s the same one. I’m just saying it’s based on it or a replica of it.
4906,2020-11-09 11:52:21,jqqime,The 1885 set wasn’t on the backlot
4907,2020-11-09 15:11:08,jqqime,"I didn’t say it was. The 1885 set, built in the Red Hills area near Sonora, CA, burned down in the 1996 Rogge Fire."
4908,2020-11-09 15:12:41,jqqime,"Apologies, my mistake. Confused it with the backlot fire. 

I would have thought that wooden set would have been destroyed after the movie anyway. A lot of the buildings were 2sided facades and it would have been unsafe."
4909,2020-11-09 15:22:03,jqqime,"No worries. They used to run excursion trains out of Railtown all the way out to the Hill Valley set — not *absolutely* sure if tours were allowed, but I’ve heard anecdotally that passengers were allowed to disembark and explore the set. Really though, AFAIK the only buildings with finished interiors were the blacksmith’s shop and the saloon, so it couldn’t have been much of a tour!"
4910,2020-11-09 03:07:16,jqpjqr,Is he about to release a Christmas song before he releases a full album?
4911,2020-11-09 03:02:43,jqpjqr,HO HO HO LETS GOOOOOOOOOOO
4912,2020-11-09 03:57:45,jqpjqr,"I just want Call Me By Your Name 😩

In all seriousness tho, has he confirmed when the album is supposed to be coming?"
4913,2020-11-09 03:07:27,jqpjqr,has anyone else released an album of Christmas music for their debut album
4914,2020-11-09 03:01:39,jqpjqr,"[lq video of the ad](https://twitter.com/ethanbrandon13/status/1325633725674053633?s=20)

4916,2020-11-09 03:15:40,jqpjqr,"He’s on crack in the best way possible but he (+ his team) knows how to market himself extremely well. I wanted Call Me By Your Name, but this should be interesting and it sounds pretty good! I’m perched"
4917,2020-11-09 03:54:16,jqpjqr,Why is nobody talking about the Michael J Fox appearance. That shit is legendary!
4918,2020-11-09 08:13:11,jqpjqr,He just pulled a reverse Rita Ora. He said 8500 comments and he drops the video but then edited the post to say 9000 comments when it got close to 8500. Lmao
4919,2020-11-09 09:24:55,jqpjqr,"I'm really rooting for Lil Nas X! I hope his success makes all those homophobic ""entertainers"" seethe even more!"
4920,2020-11-09 03:06:03,jqpjqr,"One fo the few memories I have being on campus before we got evicted thanks to covid was a short film i attempted to make a for a film festival that was gonna be about a cowboy vampire so I listened to the 7EP as a joke just to get into the ~ mood ~ but i streamed it so much I legitimately became a fan of his music outside of OTR, so im excited to see what he puts out next"
4921,2020-11-09 04:40:04,jqpjqr,i hope he got himself a nicki feature

4926,2020-11-09 06:19:16,jqpjqr,Glad that he is releasing a song but I was hoping for a year-round one. Not really big on Christmas songs nor am I looking forward to Christmas this year.
4927,2020-11-09 07:22:21,jqpjqr,"I mean, or a Green Day cover, let’s consider our options"

4988,2020-11-09 00:38:34,jqn69t,"I know people aren't gonna like this post, but for now it's probably the most effective in regards to social media marketing. Even if your demographic isn't Gen Z, we've seen artists like Fleetwood Mac have success on that platform. Granted Fleetwood Mac is a Hall of Fame worthy band, the point is content that doesn't fit the Gen Z mold can still see success. 

You should still keep using the social media sites you're using now for promotion, but just adding TikTok into that mix will help a lot."
4989,2020-11-15 19:23:21,jqn69t,Hey this is great content for r/tiktokmarketinghub . We need content like this on there!
4990,2020-11-09 11:07:21,jqn69t,"ΤikTok's algorithm is a beast. The ""bad"" part is that it's not that easy to find influencers in your niche through search."
4991,2020-11-09 12:38:52,jqn69t,"Most effective in what way? I hear a lot about the cases that have gone viral, but what sort of results would you normally expect to see?"
4992,2020-11-09 20:57:44,jqn69t,"Just in terms of actually gaining exposure that's outside of your fanbase. Facebook and IG found a way to monetize the outside interaction with your posts, so authentic growth on there is very hard to achieve even if you pay for ads. You need to rely on networking in the traditional sense with other creators for authentic growth. 

With TikTok, it's much easier to gain traction because of the way the site is designed. It's just easier to stumble upon something on TikTok versus IG or Facebook because of how the recommended tab works. YouTube is sort of the same way, but to a lesser extent. Another aspect is being able to make your music available for TikTok users to put alongside a video they've made. Most viral songs on that platform benefitted from this feature tremendously. 

Results can vary depending on what type of content you're making in the long run, but even content that isn't on the cutting edge of whatever trend is popular can see an uptick with interaction. OP's post does a pretty good job of outlining the results you can expect."

Edit 1: Wow, this really blew up! Thanks for the upvotes, kind strangers!

Edit 2: thanks for the gold kinda stranger I didn’t expect this post to blow up! My life started growing up in a small farm in northern Kansas. My father was a farmer and my mother was a cashier in our local town down the dirt road. We didn’t have much and income was very little, my best toy I got growing up was a pig bladder blown up like a balloon that I could play around with between me and my two brothers. At the age of 11 things started getting tougher in my house life due to my fathers drinking problem as it was not a good harvest that year. Like his father before him once he was done working he would come home and drink but unlike his father he wouldn’t beat us unless we messed up, his father left him and his mother to fend for themselves after world war 2 though so he had it tougher than me growing up. One time my father did drink too much and he hit my little brother Jamey. Jamey didn’t know what to do and ran away during the night during a storm. The entire family was out looking for him but we never saw Jamey again. This made my father drink more and lead him to take his life when I was at the age of 16. My older brother and me had to completely take over the farm with the help of our mom quitting her job as a cashier, life got very hard from here on out. We got a break when I was 18 with a good harvest we were able to save up some money. I was able to move out at the age of 21 and into a larger city in Tennessee. It was hard leaving the family as my ma was getting older but my older brother completely took over the farm and even expanded it into a more profitable work. I began working in what I was good at, repairing mechanics. I was a hard worker and moved up in my chain of work easily within my town. I dated aroun’ a bit but never settled down with anyone I would write home about for my first few years. When I was 26 I got a call from my ma, my brother was working with some machinery on the farm and got his hand caught in it and heavily damaged. I had to come home and help with the farm, at the time I had attained a high position as a senior mechanic within an auto shop and sometimes worked on the side with repairing electronics. I went home and had to help with the farm for a year, ma wasn’t doing good at all. She passed the next year due to kidney disease. My brother eventually recovered and I returned to Tennessee, I attempted to return to my position but due to the time I was out I had been long replaced. I had to begin to work from the bottom again when I had a client come in, she was the most beautiful woman I ever seen in Tennessee with gorgeous brown hair. Nice to say that we hit it off pretty well, within a few weeks we were dating. I can say that she was one of the best things to have happened to me in my life. At the age of 30 I married her and my first child was on the way then. I had returned to my previous position and bought a nice house near the mountains of Tennessee. At the age of 34 my second child was born. My two kids are now both in high school, one a freshman, another a Senior. I continued my career into more electronics working on computers and fixing them. In 2013 while googling how to fix a small problem with a motherboard I found a strange site named reddit.com, this website had all the answers I needed and a community always ready to help. I’ve been on the site ever since. As you can see recently, I commented on this thread and some kind stranger gave me gold. Thank you again kind stranger.

5004,2020-11-09 00:03:26,jqi0ou,People who enjoy hip hop lol
5005,2020-11-08 18:36:14,jqe685,Wait did he say anything else than that? Would be cool if they were on Lil Nas X's album but just from that reply I don't think that confirms it.
5006,2020-11-08 18:37:20,jqe685,3 white hearts means album. This is what he has been doing for a few months now

5010,2020-11-08 14:49:57,jqccjl,"Quick thought: modern music tends to be more ""agressive"", meaning people will either like it or dislike it more than older music, that has survived the test of time."

5014,2020-11-08 07:05:16,jpwg0j,"Genuine question: how many parties has he actually gone to? 

Because with the collabs where it's just JC and another person I would assume they're taking appropriate steps, such as getting regularly tested. It sucks that it's super accessible to the wealthy in the US and not so much for everyone else, but also I, and I think everyone else, would do the same thing, especially if their job relied on it. And in which case? I don't think it's a huge deal, at the very least no more than literally every other YouTuber who's also doing it and I very much doubt they're all taking precautions"

5056,2020-11-03 20:37:53,jnh7wp,I don't mind that at all. I don't really see 1994 as Zillennials but other than that...

5060,2020-11-03 20:13:06,jnh7wp,It seems like the earliest years who show traits for the next generation tend to have celebrities with a very different style compared to the ones born prior. My theory is that the years who show the earliest traits help pioneer the culture of the next generation.
5061,2020-11-03 20:24:37,jnh7wp,Naked Brothers Band. Leo Howard. Jaden Smith. Other celebrities from Disney channel and Nick shows of the 2010s. Some YouTubers like Mr. Beast.
5062,2020-11-03 20:19:06,jnh7wp,1994-1999 or 1995-2000 could be Late Millennials with Zoomer-influencing celebrities born those years. Same with 1958-1963 or 1959-1964 as Late Boomers with X-influencing celebrities.
5063,2020-11-03 20:28:53,jnh7wp,I watched all the 2010’s Disney shows and I’m pretty sure I got all of them that are Zillennials. I added the rest of your suggestions tho

5146,2020-11-02 20:54:36,jmsqwq,I disagree with your second point but only because you’re basically saying “yeah he raps better BUT WHOS MORE POPULAR THO?”
5147,2020-11-02 23:54:37,jmsqwq,10x the success lol. He’s known for one song and being a troll

5150,2020-11-03 00:05:15,jmsqwq,He has a bar about Old Town Road on his last album maybe that’s what you’re thinking of
5151,2020-11-03 09:03:19,jmsqwq,Dave East’s biggest personality trait is being a late boomer gang banger
5152,2020-11-03 11:34:53,jmsqwq,He called Old Town Road wack with a cape a while back
5153,2020-11-02 23:30:07,jmsqwq,also NLE Choppa seemingly denies coronavirus

5160,2020-11-03 03:34:58,jmsqwq,Bad week for the dusty ass old head rap fans
5161,2020-11-03 10:38:20,jmsqwq,You must’ve never listened to a Busta album before now
5162,2020-11-03 17:24:47,jmsqwq,Pretty sure Busta has been a conspiracy guy since the first album in 1996
5163,2020-11-03 18:21:44,jmsqwq,Uhh Busta released the album of the year and he’s been using these themes his entire career....
5164,2020-11-03 00:40:19,jmsqwq,Hip hop is not here to appease you. It’s not here to be politically correct. It’s here to reflect the culture. Take it or leave it. Plus Busta album was total fire

5166,2020-11-03 12:51:13,jmsqwq,I fw Gibbs as a rapper but not necessarily as a person. He spewed a bunch of anitvax bs on the breakfast club too.
5167,2020-11-03 06:39:13,jmsqwq,"because this sub loves his music lol, consistently hypocritical on that shit. why am I edgy if I mention that John Lennon or Bill Murray was a wife beater, but every discussion around Chris Brown is literally centred around that fact? don't get me wrong it should be, but I wish people here were more consistent"
5168,2020-11-03 12:49:00,jmsqwq,"People just don’t bring it up. Same for most artists.

I promise you if Dave East drops an album next month all the comments are gonna be about the music too. Not because people don’t care as much about homophobia but because most people either haven’t heard about it or already forgot by that time.

Hell I forgot until this thread that Gibbs has anti-vax lines."
5169,2020-11-03 09:34:26,jmsqwq,People only give shit to people they don't like or don't fuck with super heavy

5172,2020-11-03 17:12:08,jmsqwq,what has freddie done? from his music i haven't heard any but dave east has taken shots at Old Town Road on his music before
5173,2020-11-02 20:52:29,jmsqwq,I was worried for a second
5174,2020-11-02 20:11:50,jmsqwq,Get you someone that's treats you the way Nas does to Dave East

5177,2020-11-02 22:54:43,jmsqwq,I actually enjoyed Karma 3 quite a bit. But tbf most hiphop albums in 2020 are not listenable all the way through since they're 20+ tracks and copy/pasted flows and beats.

5186,2020-11-02 21:08:08,jmsqwq,Right? Homophobia aside... dressing up like Nicki Minaj doesn't even have much to do with that. It looked hilarious
5187,2020-11-03 07:43:03,jmsqwq,And you're ass wouldve been roasted keep it a buck lmao
5188,2020-11-03 08:28:25,jmsqwq,"I understand this feeling/what you’re trying to express, but I honestly think that’s part of the problem. 

As tempting as it is, we shouldn’t be saying that straight men must actually be gay to explain their homophobia. Some men are just homophobic because they are ignorant, have trash views, or are just trash themselves. Has nothing to do with sexuality and it’s better not to fall back on jokes like that, I think anyway"

5200,2020-11-03 00:40:31,jmsqwq,Seriously lol everyone sucking Lil Nas X dick in the comments (no pun intended) but Dave East is a better rapper. If he's ignorant well so are a shitload of other rappers and people. You can call that out but for real to pretend he is nobody? Cmon man.
5201,2020-11-03 02:59:13,jmsqwq,"He basically is a nothing rapper tho. Like nobody has a clue who he is. He’s never had a hit song, a very VAST majority of people don’t know who he is."

East wasn't even born Muslim he converted in prison. [It's not as if he's particularly devout:](https://www.villagevoice.com/2015/09/29/dave-east-has-harlem-nas-and-the-whole-city-behind-him/)

>He lights up another joint. “I ain’t the best Muslim.” Yes, East has taken the shahadah and officially converted, but he’s not overzealous, clearly. He balances the trappings of rap — women, weed, and dark liquor — with faith to the best of his ability. He prays five times a day (or tries to), and he’s staunch about upholding holy days.

No respect for dudes who do a ton of haram shit like drink and smoke and are promiscuous but use their Muslim faith to defend being homophobic. [As of 2017, a majority of American Muslims accept lesbian, gay and bisexual people as part of society](https://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/07/25171611/U.S.-MUSLIMS-FULL-REPORT.pdf), there a common media trope that Muslims are especially homophobic but these numbers aren't far behind the average American. It's 60% of millennial Muslims.

this is reddit, people love to hate on islam for being incompatible with western values and other fuck shit. people like you help them develop this un-representative perception."

And celebrities have been dressing up as other celebrities the past few years in these tribute costumes.

Only reason Dave East cares is because there is still a huge undercurrent of homophobia in the hip-hop community and among black men.  My cousin came out June 2019 and is 6 months younger than me (I'm nearly 34).  The fact that he had to basically hide who he was (I knew cause we were close) for most of his young life is a shame but was only the case cause most of my uncles are homophobic as hell.  He didn't want to deal with their mindset until he was established enough in his career."

You're throwing a hissy fit yet you're the same guy arguing and insulting people in every other comment you post. And you still call people retards. So is there a gradient on some language? Cuz clearly your weird ass makes exceptions"

How many rappers have gone back and forth with Nas? His murderous verse on East Coast Remix is ridiculous. His song Phone Jumpin with the dope sample that reminds you of Busta Rhymes 96. 

He also gave us a pretty good renditionof method man in that wutang series on hulu.

There are definitely homophobic straight people but the ones that really go out of their way to make sure you know they’re homophobic raise questions.

5372,2020-11-03 01:23:44,jmsqwq,I don't like the way you've presented your opinion therefore you're wrong - HHH
5373,2020-11-02 22:41:03,jmsqwq,"Do you remember the controversy that came with Old Town Road coming out, and Billboard refusing to label it a country song? I think that song was the cause for a lot of public scrutiny being put on places like Billboard in regards to how they define genres and categorize black music, mostly limiting them to hip-hop and R&B. I know prior to him I'd seen K. Michelle talk about wanting to make country music, but being told by record labels to stick to making R&B because she isn't marketable to a Country audience. 

Also I mean, being a gay, black, hip-hop artist and not only topping the Hot 100, but setting the record for the longest number 1 in history is maybe a tiny bit important. I'd say him coming out of the closet at the peak of his career, and having it not damage his career in the slightest also disproves the outdated ""hip-hop is homophobic"" stereotype that people have about hip-hop. I mean the only rappers who said anything negative were Pastor Troy, who nobody cares about anymore, and Dave East (who tbh, most people don't care about either)

I'd say these things are more important that being a part of a New York ""Real Hip-Hop"" revival that happens every 3-4 years. especially since the rise of Pop Smoke and Drill music in New York shows that the majority don't even want that shit. Also, the niche audience that does want that music seems to have quickly forgotten about East in favor of Griselda. Plus bringing up Nas is dumb. He's signed to Nas and was discovered by Jungle, of course they are going to work together, and of course they're not going to let Nas wash him on a track when they're trying to convince people to support his music"

None of Thugga's projects have been retroactively changed to mixtapes after the first week numbers came out. You could say that they knew it wasn't gonna sell like that the moment it dropped so they called it a mixtape. I would wager they had called it a mixtape all along and then Thugga just called it a singing album on Twitter tho. I think that they just had cold feet on releasing his debut album so they didn't need to retroactively change anything"

5422,2020-11-03 09:22:56,jmsqwq,yes because his music slurps dick
5423,2020-11-03 11:11:06,jmsqwq,If there is truth to it I think that adds a very uncomfortable dimension to many of his jokes. Like half of his schtick is being mad at women and shouting at them.

5427,2020-11-03 14:27:58,jmsqwq,"thing is, is lil nas even really relevant in hip hop? i don’t mean that as an insult, but like 99% of the people who really listen to hip hop probably don’t listen to lil nas x at all, much less regularly. so i’m just puzzled as to why dave east would even bother to care or comment. this is the first time i’ve thought of lil nas in like months. i didn’t even know about his costume until now. let the kid do what he wants, i have zero idea why it would drive dave east to say anything about it. who the hell cares"
5428,2020-11-03 04:31:12,jmsqwq,Or he’s just not masculine. Because he’s not. He’s secure with his sexuality that doesn’t make him masculine. Just like an accountant isn’t masculine

True they’re absolutely not the most popular rappers and the majority don’t know who they are but I wouldn’t call anyone with a billboard in Times Square “nothing rappers”. There’s a big difference between nobody knowing you and everybody knowing you, they’re on their way but still have a long way to go, but they are on their way."

Wouldn’t it be more fair for an artist who was gay from the beginning and still made it to the top to be considered the first. Sorry if it sound confusing I’m genuinely curious"
5437,2020-11-03 00:12:40,jmsqwq,"I commented this toward somebody else; but whenever an artist isn’t truly great, the first argument people bring up is how much they sold. 

And dare i say he sold that much NOT because the song is amazing on its own, but because this young gay black kid made a country song and white people lost their shiz."

The only shit I know Dave for is his music and it's been good. Why would I take HIS views on something personally? My OG comment is all about sticking to the music, that btw, plenty of his shows some heavy denigrating slurs against women. Oh, but he said something about some homo shit, right? Who gives a shit about bitches and hoes right now, eh? Double standards as always..."

5446,2020-11-03 12:04:01,jmsqwq,"homophobia is rampant in the black community none of this surprises me, songs in 2020 still have the F word in it and no one bats an eye. I'll admit what Dave and Freddie did is different and worse, not trying to justify anything."

5477,2020-11-03 00:24:52,jmsqwq,"im not arguing for the quality of lil nas’ music. you asked what hes done for hip hop, and i responded to that specifically. 

you really think black people werent listening to old town road?

if we’re talking quality of music though, lil nas still has dave east beat, because dave east makes recycled ass music for recycled ass people. and im not even a fan of lil nas’ music. 

dave east talks a lot and says nothing. if i wanted to listen to lyrical rap, id listen to literally anyone else that did it better 20-40 years ago. hes unoriginal as hell. at least lil nas x is trying to do something new"
5478,2020-11-03 03:12:09,jmsqwq,and then what up with all the white beards around december? shits wild bro no homo
5479,2020-11-02 19:32:47,jmsqwq,then why even come into this thread and say “i only care about the music” when you so obviously don’t? if this had no value to you why would you even click on this article and state your opinion?
5480,2020-11-02 19:36:58,jmsqwq,so in conclusion you neither care about slurs against women nor homophobic comments got you
5481,2020-11-02 19:39:47,jmsqwq,"How about neither necessarily being cool?

“Some homo shit” makes it sound like you care very much less about one than the other tho."

5491,2020-11-03 13:23:04,jmsqwq,Pop smoke used gay and retarded as insults. Idk I think they’re just writing bars and don’t really care how people feel about them
5492,2020-11-05 14:24:27,jmsqwq,"Who knows. Maybe he was playing with him since they made a song together, but that's a reach. I don't get the problem with crossdressing, if anything it supports your male/female sexuality."
5493,2020-11-03 14:48:12,jmsqwq,"Sure, in the same way saying gay as an insult isn't lol. The implication is still that a guy sucking dick is somehow bad, which isn't cool

Dude grew up in a really small city in Indiana, is it really that hard to believe he's a bit ignorant of these things?"
5494,2020-11-02 22:42:23,jmsqwq,"When he changed the name to Barter 6 he called it a mixtape:

>Can't name the **mixtape** 'Carter 6' because these fuck ass niggas tryin' to sue just like some hoes, Big ol' Blood so... 'Barter 6' on the fuckin' way.""



[he called Beautiful Thugga girls a ""singing album"" on Twitter before it dropped](https://archive.is/20170629214236/https://twitter.com/youngthug/status/857388264621092864) but [the release day press release by 300](http://press.atlanticrecords.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/YOUNG-THUG-BTG.doc) referred to it as a commercial mixtape

[Jeffrey was a mixtape before it dropped](https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/young-thugs-jeffery-mixtape-is-on-the-way-news.22755.html)

So none of Thugga's projects have been retroactively changed to mixtapes after the first week numbers came out. You could say that they knew it wasn't gonna sell like that the moment it dropped so they called it a mixtape. I would wager they had called it a mixtape all along and then Thugga just called it a singing album on Twitter tho. I think that they just had cold feet on releasing his debut album so they didn't need to retroactively change anything

edit: smh i have a 300 press release for a young thug album downloaded on my computer (don't click the link if u don't want that)"

I don’t listen to Dave East so I know nothing of what he says in his music towards women, so if you wanna provide some examples I’ll gladly make my judgements about it if it feels very much outside of the usual shit I hear from rappers.

And I’m sure there are people outside of HHH giving him shit for it, pretty sure I’ve seen something on Twitter.

If I mentioned misogyny, it was to try to make a point on people's double standards when it comes to Hip Hop's social/political landscape. 

I got shitted on for expressing my opinion and that's ok. I'm not back-peddling on my comments and I'm not going to take people's shaming tactics either. Y'all should check yourselves first and ask yourselves ""Why am I going so hard on Dave and why am I defending Little Nas X so hard when this shit has been going on since forever and I have never bat an eye?""

5567,2020-11-02 21:40:20,jmsqwq,"You realize that these ideals have real life impacts though. Like, people literally die over them.

So yes homophobia (or just LGTBQ+-phobic shit in general) gets a bigger response because as a whole their very existence has been rallied against, if we play Oppression Olympics, on a little bit of higher level than women at almost all times in history.

This isn’t to give misogynistic lyrics or statements a pass, because people have also been talking about that in hip-hop for decades, no one been rallying against homophobic lyrics like that til maybe mid 2000s. 

And if we’re being honest, women have been more welcomed in hip-hop in general than the LGBTQ community, to the point that Tyler, Frank, & Lil Nas X are the biggest names I can think of at least on the male side with Da Brat & Queen Latifah who pretty much only came out in like the past decade or so along with Syd, Young Ma as the first ones to come out with it straight out the gate."

5660,2020-12-16 02:53:45,kdlq0a,"John confirmed Under Collapse was recorded, he confirmed Dead Inside Pt 2 wasn't recorded in the studio but will still release."
5661,2020-12-15 15:54:08,kdlq0a,who said hell bent isnt coming out
5662,2020-12-16 07:24:06,kdlq0a,"LMFAO the way you stopped me tho lmao. Tracy idk he cap every time, Numb the pain studio was scrapped by X but was made so definitely gonna release, hell bent is coming the producer of the song even made a post about it when BVF dropped, Jimmy Levy said X had a verse on it so even if X isn’t on the final version that’s still an unreleased verse"
5663,2020-12-15 17:01:37,kdlq0a,not true
5664,2020-12-15 16:17:37,kdlq0a,Ahh. I didn’t notice selfish there lol
5665,2020-12-15 15:34:25,kdlq0a,Where’s the proof of nas talking shit about X
5666,2020-12-15 15:49:45,kdlq0a,"yeah me either, he shit talked x n ion like that"
5667,2020-12-15 17:02:00,kdlq0a,Cleo said it
5668,2020-12-15 15:35:31,kdlq0a,i have no proof but u remember when we first found out abt the song everyone was saying he had a nikki minaj fan account and talked about x calling him an abuser😭💀
5669,2020-12-15 16:17:54,kdlq0a,He didn’t tho lol
5670,2020-12-15 17:04:35,kdlq0a,"doesn’t mean that everything on here will release. school globes with lil nas is 50/50. shawty on 4 legs with thugger no. heart of valor unlikely, angel unlikely, fortnite with tory lanez no, BAD! unlikely"
5671,2020-12-15 15:36:33,kdlq0a,Does him being a nikki stan have anything to do with the quality of his music or the fact that he’s a fan of x?
5672,2020-12-15 17:36:46,kdlq0a,School Globes is best unreleased song
5673,2020-12-15 17:06:02,kdlq0a,"Why no fortnite, and school globes?"
5674,2020-12-15 22:01:43,kdlq0a,why do you think that mr allergic
5675,2020-12-15 15:37:16,kdlq0a,no idc about him being a fan of nikki im saying people said he talked down on X on the account can u read😐
5676,2020-12-16 04:02:51,kdlq0a,noooo ☹️😳
5677,2020-12-15 15:40:37,kdlq0a,But the thing is that he didn’t.   The fact that you are. Believing it just because people said it before says a lot.  There’s no proof either so that just makes your point irrelevant
5678,2020-12-15 15:42:57,kdlq0a,youre arguing for no reason i said i have no proof... just stating accusations wether they are tru or not idrc i still dont want him on the song because hes ass.

5725,2020-12-13 23:57:44,kclw4g,Hey I am John and I approve of this meme
5726,2020-12-13 22:29:51,kckaa1,"If the RIAA had their way listening to music with the windows open would be illegal as people walking down your sidewalk would hear it without paying.   
Whether or not saving a YouTube video falls under a fair use exemption or not would depend on your jurisdiction.   
Most likely the license for streaming does not include saving to disk but you would have to read the ToS to be sure."
5727,2020-12-13 22:50:58,kckaa1,"It's illegal.  Spotify is really, really cheap, like when I was a kid music cost 100s of times as much for 1% the variety you can get.  The benefit you obtain from this, that you describe as helping you focus and enabling your career, is absolutely worth the investment."
5728,2020-12-13 22:30:48,kckaa1,"YouTube, Spotify, amazon music all have streaming services that are ad-free for not too much of a fee"
5729,2020-12-13 22:44:53,kckaa1,That is illegal. There is no question about it. You are copying music that you don't have the copy**right** to. I don't think you are doing anything wrong though. Copyright law is bullshit.
5730,2020-12-13 22:46:08,kckaa1,can I use your animations in a video for free? I mean I love making videos and it's so much easier when I can just download somebody else's animations from the internet and not pay for them.
5731,2020-12-13 22:31:26,kckaa1,"I'm biased based on the artist for this. 

If it's someone like Minaj/Bieber who are famous for almost zero actual talent & make millions anyway, go ahead, rip their shit. 

For smaller artists, I tend to avoid ripping free music. 

Then again, the income from streaming is close to none anyway, most money is made on touring & merch."
5732,2020-12-13 23:06:34,kckaa1,In high school I had almost $500 of songs that I downloaded for free. It’s not “okay” but you most likely won’t suffer any consequences for doing it
5733,2020-12-13 22:29:08,kckaa1,adblocker + youtube = same ordeal.
5734,2020-12-13 22:52:27,kckaa1,"I mean, I download it from YouTube so it’s free access but the thing is I can’t play YouTube videos for background sounds and it comes with ads, with the bolt app it removes both of those."
5735,2020-12-13 22:53:50,kckaa1,"Sure, as long as mention me or credit me at least you can use the entire animation, they aren’t at that level yet. But I’m improving."
5736,2020-12-13 22:48:08,kckaa1,"
Lol 😂"
5737,2020-12-13 22:50:13,kckaa1,"Except the amount of ads YouTube pops is getting worse every month, so I say up theirs."
5738,2020-12-13 23:18:32,kckaa1,You don't have the right to download things from youtube.
5739,2020-12-13 23:19:19,kckaa1,"Nah, I want to take the credit and claim that I made them."
5740,2020-12-14 02:51:13,kckaa1,"Nope, I don't need to do that. Did you notify the artist you stole from that you were playing their music?

Do you credit then in your animations since you listen to them when working?"
5741,2020-12-14 02:51:38,kckaa1,The bottom line is you are stealing from the artist. And as an artist yourself I would hope you would understand this.
5742,2020-12-13 23:30:06,kckaa1,So how bad are the consequences.
5743,2020-12-13 23:26:04,kckaa1,"Screw it,  like I said their not at that level yet and I’m nowhere close to getting monetized. I’m just asking if I will get any consequences for doing this."
5744,2020-12-14 02:54:37,kckaa1,"Sigh... your kinda changing the subject. I’m not using music without permission in my animations, I’m just listening to them in the background by downloading it for free, I’m not sharing it with anyone. just listen for myself and I download it for free. Which jets the law concerned and it worries me a bit."
5745,2020-12-13 23:39:27,kckaa1,"There is almost no chance that you get caught, so none."
5746,2020-12-14 02:56:06,kckaa1,You're still stealing. You just want to know if you'll pay consequences for it.
5747,2020-12-14 02:58:11,kckaa1,Most people say that I won’t get any consequences wether what I’m doing is wrong or not. Even if I try to stop it could happen again and stuff like this happens to everyone even you. All I want to know is how much trouble I will get for breaking this unrealistic copyright law.

I did encounter an issue with a few songs in `Joe Hisaishi - Studio Ghibli Miyazaki Hayao & Joe Hisaishi Soundtrack Box [16]`, Mega kept saying there's a decryption error when downloading.  Here are the songs that I have trouble downloading:

- Disc 3 My Neighbor Totoro track 1
- Disc 9 Howl's Moving Castle Howl’s Moving Castle track 21
- Disc 10 Ponyo tracks 30, 31
- Disc 12 The Wind Rises tracks 4, 6, 26

Not sure if others are seeing the same problem?"

This issue came up before on my previous post, this was the solution provided by Mega Support:

Open your MEGA account in a browser. Just before you are about to click 'Download' of the affected file press F12 (Option + cmd + J) to open your JavaScript Console. The screen will divide. Type 'skipcheck=1' in the bottom line of the Console, click 'Enter' and then select the 'Download' in your MEGA account window."

I'm not sure how my post come up since I have zero Elliot Smith in my collection, but I'm glad that it found you!

1. Copy the long code near the top of the post

2. Google ""base64"" and click on the first site that pops up (one that ends in .org), 

3. Make sure ""Decode"" is selected at the top once you're in the website (it should be the default)

4. Paste the code in the top field where it reads ""Type (or paste) here...""

5. Press ""< DECODE >""

6. The decoded link which would be a Mega link in this place will show up on the bottom field

7. Copy and paste this link to your URL and that should take you to my index

Hope that helps."

Most of the titles I only have one version of, so searching up the catalog numbers and including them to my organization system doesn't make much sense in my specific case. For the ones I have multiple versions of I do specify in the sub folders, to the best of my ability, which version's which. For the most part it is simply one click away to find out the number of tracks included that would then give you a clue as to whether it's a version you already have or not. Hope that helps."

Also by incomplete discographies, I wasn't talking about the index, but you don't have every Future or Kid Cudi studio album for example. I'm not telling you that you need to go find them, just saying. No mistake on Your Part. Also on another note there's a problem with the album ""live.love.asap"" which sounds all distorted on some songs, I just ended up sticking to my mp3 version of it."

Yeah, I find that quite strange as well, why do the Japanese releases of North American/European artists get bonus tracks while the original releases don't? Seems a bit unfair haha

wonder if any songs off WLR will chart next week (my guess is not, mayyybe the song with cudi).    
also feel like that meg/dababy song is gonna be a slow climber but eventually reach top 30"
6014,2020-12-29 23:45:27,kmo7u2,I kinda like how the xmss songs takeover the charts. It cleans the sheet for the new year.
6015,2020-12-29 22:17:36,kmo7u2,"It'll be interesting to see how the charts recover next week when all the Christmas songs drop off. I'm not sure how much of WLR will chart, the top song has only got 3 mil plays on Spotify as of today."
6016,2020-12-30 00:36:18,kmo7u2,"First Christmas without a girlfriend in 4 years . Both our families aren’t Christian so we don’t celebrate it with them but when we were together we would celebrate like in a secular American relationshipy way. Anyways what I’m saying, WLR is the Christmas album I needed this year"
6017,2020-12-30 04:53:52,kmo7u2,"Almost 40 songs on the top 100 are Christmas. They have to do something about ""seasonal"" music. Its holding back alot of artists from the achievement of charting. Artists are going to quit dropping music in December so they don't have to compete with Christmas music"
6018,2020-12-30 02:22:54,kmo7u2,they should really do something about the christmas songs on the charts in this new streaming era. when Mariah Carey went number 1 last year on a 25 year old song it was kinda cute but having the whole top 10 being dominated by christmas songs is tiring
6019,2020-12-30 00:26:22,kmo7u2,I don’t think this is the week of January 02 right?
6020,2020-12-30 05:26:09,kmo7u2,The fact that Christmas in Hollis can't get on this list during Christmas time infuriates me. Let's get some good Christmas music on this list

6022,2020-12-30 02:04:20,kmo7u2,People’s obsession with Christmas music is something I’ll never understand. Is it a religious/Christian thing?
6023,2020-12-29 23:29:44,kmo7u2,"If WLR sells ~125k I feel like a couple of songs will chart, especially since less people are gonna listen to Christmas songs after Dec 25th"
6024,2020-12-30 00:45:57,kmo7u2,"the kanye track would have been a top 5 debut on spotify without christmas songs, i think itll make it"
6025,2020-12-30 00:54:41,kmo7u2,Blinding Lights might come back next week

6027,2020-12-29 23:52:30,kmo7u2,"For the marketing that album got, the first week sale is gonna flop"
6028,2020-12-30 01:18:43,kmo7u2,"Yeah I'm not entirely sure it can beat out taylor swifts album for number 1 anymore tbh, which is sad because if kid cudi was on it that would have been a top 10 hit easily with the album going number 1 even though it was originally big 1.5 years ago, a fan post of the song on youtube uploaded recently as they all get taken down is getting more views than some songs on wlr"
6029,2020-12-30 06:06:56,kmo7u2,2016-2018 i had a gf every christmas! then 2019 and now 2020 i’ve been single. as much as i like a relationship i’ve appreciated my time single. hope you can too man
6030,2020-12-30 05:20:21,kmo7u2,I mean what can they do. AIWFC had 17 million streams in one day on Spotify a couple of days ago. If that’s not deserving of number 1 I don’t know what is.
6031,2020-12-30 13:46:01,kmo7u2,it is. charts are counted week ahead
6032,2020-12-30 02:18:19,kmo7u2,Not necessarily. People just associate it with the holidays. A lot of people are definitely just letting Spotify playlists run the music
6033,2020-12-30 03:07:01,kmo7u2,"Nah man, for me it's just a warm cozy vibe to have Christmas music playing when it's cold outside and I'm at work. Perfect background music for this time of year."
6034,2020-12-30 17:55:23,kmo7u2,"It’s not really a religious thing, christmas is very secularized in America."
6035,2020-12-30 17:12:58,kmo7u2,Christmastime gives many people a feeling that I would say is comparable to nostalgia. Listening to the music helps people get into that feeling. Plus tradition
6036,2020-12-30 07:54:27,kmo7u2,I think Slayer doing better than the kanye song
6037,2020-12-30 06:05:35,kmo7u2,what marketing? it’s literally almost driven by hype generated by carti fans and blogs. no real singles prior to it. it’s just carti posting shit
6038,2020-12-30 00:22:46,kmo7u2,Well I mean the album was terrible
6039,2020-12-30 06:11:10,kmo7u2,Yeah I’m equal parts nervous and excited about my single life. It’s just the uncertainty that gets to me sometimes although I’m sure I’ll be fine. Thanks bro
6040,2020-12-30 02:30:12,kmo7u2,Ah ok makes sense
6041,2020-12-30 16:24:34,kmo7u2,also don't underestimate how many people are using this for their businesses
6042,2020-12-30 20:14:42,kmo7u2,"True shit, can't remember the last time I heard someone regard Christmas celebrations in a religious light"
6043,2020-12-30 09:58:07,kmo7u2,"Yeah, Slay3r has the most streams."
6044,2020-12-30 03:37:48,kmo7u2,"it's good, remove a couple songs and it's a 8/10 at least"
6045,2020-12-30 06:11:48,kmo7u2,no worries man. you got this!
6046,2020-12-31 01:06:28,kmo7u2,like there's basically another holiday on top of it with Santa and presents that even non-Christians practice and tell their kids abt
6047,2020-12-30 04:48:13,kmo7u2,The beginning sucks and nobody is going to listen to the rest of the album if they get a bad first impression.
6048,2020-12-30 04:11:42,kmo7u2,Not even close it’s a 4 at best lmao
6049,2020-12-30 05:03:05,kmo7u2,"i completely understand but that's why I'm saying this, ppl listened to the first half and turned it off"
6050,2020-12-30 10:08:57,kmo7u2,Best part of the album is beginning and Album is great
6051,2020-12-30 05:03:59,kmo7u2,idk how you can listen to the second half and think most of those songs arent good (assuming youre a carti fan)
6052,2020-12-30 04:57:26,kmo7u2,"As an overall tape yes.

But there's still a few songs that are prime Carti"

It’s intended purpose was to show who is making noise a lot on social media during certain times, but it’s not accurately reflected. For example, when a big artist drops a new album or has big news, most people would go and tag the artist name to reflect the importance of that event. That buzz would make the artist appear on the chart. BTS still remains number one during times when they’re literally doing nothing. If you want sympathy or someone to agree with you, try going to r/kpop ☺️"

He's a smart, incredibly physically active and accomplished dude, and a definitive go-getter in life. When he told me he worked an upper level position at his company and essentially didn't answer to anyone, I could tell instantly that he'd be fit to run the company altogether if he learned to believe in himself and step into his leadership capabilities—this was the impression I got immediately when we first met, before I knew his birthday; let alone his whole chart. He also hosts the game nights with his friends and is an extremely competitive gamer. The thing is, he's actually a pretty shy and soft-spoken guy, but with such a quietly certain air of command that any remotely spiritually in-tune person couldn't miss it. He doesn't carry any shame about himself, as so far he's been transparent about the kind of quirks and flaws I could never openly disclose. And despite his significant reservations with dating (as correctly, explicitly predicted by his chart), he made his intent known with me straightforwardly. There was no mistaking that I was what he wanted and that he was gonna make a go for it. *Whew.*

The only problem I noticed is controlling the anger when it erupts. But I diffuse so quickly and anger is replaced with this need to fix the problem immediately. A lot of people can't understand this, it's a bit hard to follow this dynamic. Usually people get angry and they hold that anger for at least some time. We don't, we just wanna move on. But piss us off one time too many and it's bye bye."

6133,2020-12-27 16:07:35,kl4at5,I don’t know what to say about this one. What is considered powerful is subjective. I can say Beyoncé and her Scorpio moon is powerful in the industry along with Elon musk and his Virgo moon or Jeff Bezos and his Sag moon. Martin Luther King has a Pisces moon and you can see he took a peaceful but effective approach that we still use today. Is that any less powerful than Malcom X?

universally though, i’d say help her to find things she’s passionate about and then just encourage her and hype her up! i am v fortunate to have parents that have encouraged me to try my hand at just about everything. when i’d find something i liked they always cheered me on! 

we lunar ariens loooove to be gassed up by our people lol. just be genuine about it, that taurus sun will KNOW if somethings not 100%."
6179,2020-12-27 20:21:28,kl4at5,"Hey! Lunar Aries here! I think the best thing you could do is to just let them explore whatever new and exciting thing they’re into at that time. Cause it changed a lot for me. I was into a lot of different things at different times in my childhood. But my parents didn’t force me to stick to something if I said I wasn’t interested in doing it anymore. Granted, once I was into something, I was INTO IT. Like when I wanted to try skateboarding (I suck), they just tried to support me as best as they could. And if they didn’t know anything about skating, they just tried to show support or get me together with one of their friends that knew more about skating. To sum everything up, we can be impulsive but passionate as well. Nurturing their passions and supporting them by giving them the feeling of freedom will help a lot too. Hope that helps!"

But I'm seriously in awe of the drive—insane across the board once a mind's made up. 

I feel like it's the sign made especially prominent when accompanied by a complementary planet; perhaps Mercury or Mars.

Like bro we get you're going through shit and we support you but if you're gonna keep complaining on pod you're falling apart and right after say nah I don't wanna talk about it with ya'll, why even say anything then? the joke lost its funnies when we realized it was real, now it's sad. get better Big Rors"
6274,2020-12-26 11:59:06,kkfz8y,"Lol that was a weird conversation, it makes me question if they know tech as well as they think they do.

Also did I peep this correctly: was Mal mad cause Judge my Spotify called the music he listens to gay?"
6275,2020-12-26 14:38:38,kkfz8y,"I sat back listening to it just smiling knowing Joe and them had no earthly idea what they were talking about. They need a producer bad, they’re going out sad."
6276,2020-12-26 12:36:48,kkfz8y,Has Joe never heard of a data scientist or developers. Pathetic they keep mentioning Spotify
6277,2020-12-26 11:23:10,kkfz8y,Yeah it was literally just some random guys.
6278,2020-12-26 13:12:03,kkfz8y,i have a hard time believing he was this hung up on tahiry and cyn lol
6279,2020-12-26 19:29:38,kkfz8y,a lot of people use spotify do these kind of quirky things without being officially working for spotify. joe is just salty
6280,2020-12-28 16:50:14,kkfz8y,I literally popped in here to talk about how loud and wrong that take was.   Its your spotify wrapped up against blogs and forums about what's actually hot and then it clowns you for it
6281,2020-12-27 03:34:18,kkfz8y,I’m listening to it rn and it’s definitely not even that deep what tf are they talking about
6282,2020-12-29 10:09:23,kkfz8y,I have been calling Clubhouse hipster Discord for weeks now. Thank you for this take.
6283,2020-12-26 22:20:50,kkfz8y,Joe wants to be the star
6284,2020-12-26 19:09:17,kkfz8y,I agree this is the second time he mentioned it. On one of the last pods he said next year will be the last year for this podcast...
6285,2020-12-27 09:44:37,kkfz8y,Not if they get that 💰💰💰
6286,2020-12-28 16:12:30,kkfz8y,The pod has to evolve soon
6287,2020-12-28 16:52:25,kkfz8y,"They have no deal, don't seem like any deal is coming.  No live shows til 2022, they might just find some other shit to do"
6288,2020-12-26 15:45:46,kkfz8y,Pastor Rors saying they cancelled Jesus had me shook. I ain’t never did the math.
6289,2020-12-26 11:21:39,kkfz8y,That was a whole lot of stupidity...
6290,2020-12-26 16:10:10,kkfz8y,They said 2 people couldn't play on 1 ps5 smh 😔

6293,2020-12-26 20:52:35,kkfz8y,"This is exactly why certain shit shouldn’t be brought up on this podcast. There’s no way they’re going to explain this to this degree (even though it’d only be like two minutes of actual reading lol) and that’s fine, they aren’t a political podcast. But telling half the story is worse than not telling the story at all if you’re gonna be misleading people."
6294,2020-12-26 19:34:02,kkfz8y,Mal is an absolute fucking idiot.
6295,2020-12-30 02:46:36,kkfz8y,I believe they just say some wild stuff sometimes so we go do the research
6296,2020-12-26 15:42:07,kkfz8y,They talked about it when it happened but they approached it as if Wayne owned ALL of Drakes/Nickis masters and basically didn’t believe it.
6297,2020-12-26 11:32:45,kkfz8y,he Sr. Joe's Assistant now tho...haha
6298,2020-12-26 16:52:31,kkfz8y,U ever notice if it’s the Republicans fault then all of government is bad but if it’s the Democrats it’s just the democrats lol
6299,2020-12-26 18:27:35,kkfz8y,My man is dumb as rocks when it comes to politics
6300,2020-12-29 10:10:11,kkfz8y,Got to man. It's bad for the environment.
6301,2020-12-27 00:25:10,kkfz8y,Dude needs a tin foil hat.
6302,2020-12-26 16:53:26,kkfz8y,For real cuz the misinformation being spread is crazy. Mad about millions of dollars getting sent in a bill that isn’t even the COVID relief bill
6303,2020-12-26 17:18:06,kkfz8y,Parks doesnt know all that shit like yall think he does either
6304,2020-12-28 08:03:42,kkfz8y,"Technically you need 2 consoles to play online in the same house because each console will take up an account for online play. What you’re prolly used to is co-op or split screen which you can have multiple people play on a single console, however this is offline function. Meaning you can’t play together against other ppl online as well."

To me it's real, it's transparent even if it's sad 

The show has lost that, which made the show unique"

6314,2020-12-29 19:17:01,kkfz8y,Mal never stopped listening to Frank Ocean in the shower confirmed.
6315,2020-12-28 22:37:54,kkfz8y,Wish they'd at least post their cast on Spotify because listening to it via soundcloud aint it.
6316,2020-12-26 12:56:40,kkfz8y,I get not liking Spotify but I wish Joe treated them the way they do Duke and just shut up about them. This shit was just a joke not some sneaky way to ‘see the algorithm’ or some shit
6317,2020-12-29 19:19:12,kkfz8y,"To be fair, with the charges he had he can never be publicly hung up on any of the women hes with since with one thing they say he could get fucked up.

Raqi leaked fake msgs and if Cyn didn't clear it up he would have been fucked."

6321,2020-12-28 22:40:37,kkfz8y,what is the pod's primary source of income? stream counts from soundcloud and youtube? can't be much.. and I know cash app isn't providing them each a salary..
6322,2020-12-28 16:54:57,kkfz8y,Back to shady and rapping

Everyone knows nas went to hell for snuffin Jesus"
6324,2020-12-28 06:19:29,kkfz8y,the Bible is full on the cancel culture if you think about it. God been cancelling the humanity ever since Eve bit the apple.
6325,2020-12-26 14:47:22,kkfz8y,That conversation was hilarious and should've been an entire segment.
6326,2020-12-26 13:03:44,kkfz8y,"Bro the whole crucifixion is stupid. How can an God (Jesus) who’s the child of God, in which Gods are immortal SACRIFICE himself?

How can someone who can’t die, ‘sacrifice’ himself for sins his dad gave us lol"
6327,2020-12-27 03:21:11,kkfz8y,"I mean you can  
  
But split screen and coop type games are on their way out and its an infinitely worse way of playing a regular game if you actually care about enjoying it"
6328,2020-12-26 23:25:02,kkfz8y,"He did mean that. He's just (admittedly) ignorant, as are the fools calling ""finesse"". 😪"
6329,2020-12-26 23:24:18,kkfz8y,Depends on game you can play cod coop multiplayer online
6330,2020-12-28 16:55:59,kkfz8y,"Also, 2 accounts can be logged into one console at one time.  I guess if they were buying separate games it might get annoying having to switch around but if your brother is Joe Budden why not just ask for 2 systems.  He spends more than that on his explore page"
6331,2020-12-26 22:58:32,kkfz8y,Mal speaks on politics like a Redditor who scrolls the news section and only reads the headlines.
6332,2020-12-26 22:12:47,kkfz8y,Enlightened centrist shit
6333,2020-12-26 20:15:52,kkfz8y,You didn’t need to add the politics part lmao
6334,2020-12-26 17:42:33,kkfz8y,True
6335,2020-12-27 05:36:17,kkfz8y,"Parks at least doesn't talk about shit he knows nothing about, as far as I can remember anyway."
6336,2020-12-26 20:17:09,kkfz8y,And that’s appreciated. I’d rather someone not add to a fire just cause mal started one.
6337,2020-12-26 19:04:42,kkfz8y,he's not an expert either but he definitely is more well informed than the rest and is willing to stay quiet on a political topic if he doesn't know the answer
6338,2020-12-27 13:57:09,kkfz8y,"Obviously I'm not talking about the sleeper when I put at the ""very end"". He played another song at the very end that sounded like his sleeper sampled from the other song I'm trying to find the name of. Rory said ""this is getting played tomorrow"" to give more context into the song I am seeking."
6339,2020-12-27 03:08:02,kkfz8y,Couldn’t agree more.
6340,2020-12-26 15:20:15,kkfz8y,I mean... could it be the algorithm knows something we don't?
6341,2020-12-28 22:58:24,kkfz8y,Try apple podcast
6342,2020-12-26 15:48:30,kkfz8y,He don’t even shut up about duke or Kanye like he said he would
6343,2020-12-30 18:06:57,kkfz8y,Also they don't have touring right now. Not sure how much they make off merch

6347,2020-12-26 22:15:41,kkfz8y,Atheism is not welcome here. Noted.
6348,2020-12-27 00:11:14,kkfz8y,And got the nerve act smug about the shit SMMFH
6349,2020-12-26 19:25:11,kkfz8y,probably why he stayed quiet then

6351,2020-12-27 03:17:37,kkfz8y,He also said he doesnt talk about the real gang rappers yet he talked about King Von for like 8 weeks straight

6353,2020-12-26 14:22:25,kkfz8y,"I’m just making a joke but which Bible version? There’s like a new version every few centuries like it’s a iOS update

But yeh, Bible says Jesus is a GOD and Gods are immortal according to the Bible. Therefore, using common sense, you cannot sacrifice/kill something that’s immortal as they cannot die. Which means the sins that God gave humanity in the first place, Jesus hasn’t ‘saved us’ as he cannot die. Also, sins and sacrifice the idea is dumb as it’s God who gave us the sins in the first place

It’s like for example, Pfizer creating a virus that will kill us and then Pfizer creates a vaccine that saves us. And we must be thankful to Pfizer for getting the vaccine even though Pfizer created the virus in the first place to hurt us

I’m just making fun of religious ideas bro. It’s not that deep"
6354,2020-12-26 15:26:08,kkfz8y,"Religion is some people's whole belief system my bro -  I'd say you ""making fun"" of it could be pretty deep for them, no? Also the question you've posed isn't at all original...it is almost as old as Christianity itself. Many would respond that as Jesus is a human embodiment of God, he was able to die. Not religious by the way but you could improve your awareness of these age-old debates then come to your own conclusion without the smugness or necessarily making fun of anything. Peace"
6355,2020-12-26 15:30:08,kkfz8y,"I appreciate your response but nah. The Bible both Old and New Testament has stated multiple times that Jesus is ‘the son of God’

Jesus is presented and has been for thousands years as literally a God and not a ‘human embodiment as you think it could mean. Again it was just a joke but yeh Jesus is a God ultimately according to the bible and I just made fun of the sacrifice point the pod made"
6356,2020-12-26 18:04:04,kkfz8y,"""Incarnation, central Christian doctrine that God became flesh, that God assumed a human nature and became a man in the form of Jesus Christ, the Son of God and the second person of the Trinity""

Source: https://www.britannica.com/topic/Incarnation-Jesus-Christ

Seriously man...this debate is centuries old, they even discuss it in the Bible. There are tons of debates all over the net about this. You don't have to pick one side or the other but the answer is far from obvious and your question is nowhere near as original as you seem to think it is. As I said,I'm not religious but humble yourself a little."
