I'm not sure what the reasoning must have been for Kacey Musgraves to win AOTY. I hadn't heard of her at all before she was nominated. That might have something to do with country-pop (besides Taylor Swift) barely being a thing in my country. Looking up what Dirty Computer was up against it's pretty tough competition. Post Malone was nominated and his music was pretty unavoidable during that year.  


I hope you've also checked out her previous albums. Dirty Computer is great but my personal favourite (in fact, one of my all-time favourite albums) is The Archandroid. It's so diverse and ambitious."

 [artist pic](https://lastfm.freetls.fastly.net/i/u/252/2a96cbd8b46e442fc41c2b86b821562f.png)  

> Janelle Monáe (born Janelle Monáe Robinson on December 1, 1985 in Kansas City, Kansas) is an American singer, songwriter, dancer, producer, and performer.

>  She moved to New York to study theatre at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy. Her original plan was to pursue a career on Broadway, but she soon changed her mind and returned to music. After moving to Atlanta, Georgia in 2003,  Monáe founded the Wondaland Arts Society with like-minded young artists, and made a couple of appearances on OutKast's 2006 album Idlewild, where she is featured on the songs ""Call the Law"" and ""In Your Dreams"".

> By 2007, Monáe was ready to release her first solo work, titled Metropolis. It was originally conceived as a concept album in four parts, or suites, which were to be released through her website and mp3 download sites. After the release of the first part of the series, Metropolis Suite I of IV: The Chase in mid-2007, these plans were altered following her signing with Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' label, Bad Boy Records, later in the year. The label gave an official and physical release to the first suite in August 2008, which was retitled Metropolis: The Chase Suite (Special Edition) and included two new tracks. The EP was generally well-received by critics, gaining Monáe a 2009 Grammy nomination in the Best Urban/Alternative Performance for her single ""Many Moons"", festival appearances, and opening slots for the indie pop band Of Montreal. Monáe also toured as the opening act for band No Doubt on their summer 2009 tour.

>  In a November 2009 interview, Monáe revealed the title and concept behind her album The ArchAndroid. The second and third suites of Metropolis are combined into this full-length release, in which Monáe's alter-ego, Cindi Mayweather - also the protagonist of Metropolis: The Chase Suite - becomes a messiah-like figure to the android community of Metropolis.

This, a song called *Rocket Scientist by Teddybears* and a few songs from the Portal soundtracks are all I've got and already I've kinda hit a wall... Anybody have any suggestions of songs in a similar vein?"

His best of the decade list is better thought out and better justified than almost every other music outlet. At this point he is turning into the Robert Christgau for the Youtube generation.

A very large amount of these are completely new to this sub.  If you dont like fantano just ignore his name, the rest for all the files are great artists and albums.

But as soon as I have to remember your pronouns and can't just assume them, I get anxious and end up not talking at all for fear of offending you. For example, Janelle Monae is super feminine to me, and I would not remember to use ""they,"" because I consider myself someone who would use those pronouns because I'm really androgynous. And she doesn't seem like someone who is the same gender as me, you know?"

89,2020-01-17 18:23:11,eq37cf,"This is great. Thanks for the transcript OP.

I’ve never looked forward to a posthumous album until I heard that Circles was announced. A large reason for that is that it seems like a genuine Mac album. 

A few months after Mac died, I went and found a shit ton of leaks, thanks to Reddit. Among those leaks were Good News, Circles, Everybody, Woods (as Telescope, iirc), and Once a Day. The rumours of “Circles” being released circulated early, and through all of this it seems to have stayed original. Backed by the fact that Mac’s family is in support of it, and Jon worked on it, it just seems very authentic. 

Now that it’s been released I can say this... the songs that were leaked were minimally changed. “Everybody” is the only one that had very noticeable changes, and that’s just because the leaked version was very raw. 

Overall I think Jon did a great job. RIP Mac."
90,2020-01-17 19:54:43,eq37cf,Jon Brion is an awesome human being. Sucks that he's had to go through this twice now.
91,2020-01-17 18:45:12,eq37cf,"Very interesting read. Shows you how much work goes into each song. 

The album sounds so good. I never had the feeling at any time, that this is something mac would not have approved. This release was handled so well, and somehow I now finally can accept that he's gone (as stupid as it sounds, but I had this kinda feeling). Listened to him since 2009, and after all this album is a perfect ending."
92,2020-01-17 23:46:24,eq37cf,"This really is the worst timeline but I’m glad Circles released and kudos to Jon Brion for tastefully fleshing out what needed to be worked, though *Everybody* might have a bit too much Fiona Apple/JB vibe. 

 Circles is a stripped down, raw, almost folky album with a couple classic beat bangers and is a fitting coda to a varied and sublime discography. A lifetime of work in 10 years...

There’s so much more out there- Maclib, Pink Slime, studio stuff, but this is his last album and I can’t help but feel melancholy for what could’ve been, Mac was evolving so fast. I saw him on the WMWTSO tour and it was honestly such a good vibe high energy show but albums like Live from Space, The Divine Feminine, and Swimming showed where he was headed what a true artist he was. So humble and nobody ever has anything bad to say about him. If you could bring back one artist who wasn’t done yet, my vote would be for Mac. 

Most dope for life.

Edit: imagine being the only feature on Mac’s last record. That’s heavy, shout out to that guy."
93,2020-01-17 19:10:46,eq37cf,"Thanks for this, was hoping we get some sort of ""making-of/behind the scenes"" stuff"

99,2020-01-18 01:03:06,eq37cf,"I think for ""Once a day"" he should have left in the piano version that leaked when he had first passed. I was hoping tm88 would in ""Thats life"", but no. So all I have is a small clip of the best version of that song possible in my opinion"
100,2020-01-17 19:25:15,eq37cf,Thank you for posting this

102,2020-01-19 03:04:44,eq37cf,glanced at the title and thought it said Joe Biden
103,2020-01-17 20:14:59,eq37cf,Woods is almost like a completely different song than telescope imo. Also hand me downs is a pretty modified version of guitar case. That being said I agree and I think this album was handled perfectly with what they had.
104,2020-01-17 19:10:13,eq37cf,"Yeah now that we know Circles was supposed to release about 90 days after Swimming as he was on tour, and given the timeline of his death and everything we’ve heard, it seems Circles was really in its final finishing touches stages. And i’m incredibly grateful Brion completed Mac’a vision. the way he talks about him makes him sound so humble and in tune with Brion"
105,2020-01-17 23:28:44,eq37cf,"Hand Me Downs was leaked as Guitar Case. That's the one that changed the most I think. Leak only had the guitar and drums on the beat, no hook and only the second verse. For whatever reason the second verse isn't synced to the beat the same way in the album version. It sounds super weird to me. He also added effects on his voice for some reason"
106,2020-01-17 23:41:34,eq37cf,"“That’s on Me” is greatly different compared to the leaked version. It originally encompassed a very somber mood, largely due to the absence of much instrumentation. In the album version, there is an abundance of guitars, lending it to have a much brighter sound. I personally find it less depressing than before, and find it more akin to a song from The Beatles now."
107,2020-01-17 19:55:34,eq37cf,I’m not familiar with the first. What happened? Truly so much respect for him. I cannot imagine the emotions he must have experienced working on this.
108,2020-01-17 21:23:14,eq37cf,"Word.
If he didn’t go through the things he did, he may have not been ready for this job."
109,2020-01-18 16:54:51,eq37cf,Mind sharing?
110,2020-01-17 20:30:35,eq37cf,"Telescope made me cry a lot, such a beautiful song and I was going through an emotional point in my life. Really wish Woods gave me that same feeling. I just wish I could listen to telescope again, two completely different songs"
111,2020-01-17 21:42:04,eq37cf,"The only problem with this is we have no idea what stage of production the leaks are from. They’re not “Mac’s versions” that leaked, him and Brion were working hard on finishing these when he died. so “Telescope” isn’t necessarily Mac’s raw version."
112,2020-01-17 22:14:07,eq37cf,wow do you have a source on Circles meant to come out while he was on tour?
113,2020-01-20 22:01:36,eq37cf,"Hey I don't know if you'll see this but Jon Brion's latest interview suggests that Circles wasn't meant to be released (or even completed) until after he returned from the Swimming tour.

[source](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/20/arts/music/mac-miller-jon-brion-circles.html)"
114,2020-01-18 01:51:31,eq37cf,it feels like there's a weird auto tune on once a day compared to the leak
115,2020-01-18 04:44:08,eq37cf,Almost sounds like the first and second verses were originally going to be 2 different songs IMO
116,2020-01-17 20:19:41,eq37cf,He was very close with Elliott Smith. [Here's](https://youtu.be/PK4okHerWeI) a performance you should check out.
117,2020-01-17 20:12:59,eq37cf,I think he meant having to hear Mac's voice on the tracks as he was putting touches on them. Must have been truly difficult hearing his voice so soon after he passed. Phenomenal album though. Glad it saw the light of day!

119,2020-01-17 21:24:52,eq37cf,"Yeah I feel like telescope would have fit better especially with a lot of the space stuff. I have the leak if you want to hear it again though

Edit: I still have it for those that want it, but as someone else pointed out the telescope isn’t actually the real version at all. It was made by someone else from the stems and woods was a lot closer to the original version."
120,2020-01-18 00:03:16,eq37cf,I like the bare & raw feeling of Woods over the kinda over produced Telescope (and the hook is way better on Woods than Telescope)
121,2020-01-17 22:10:41,eq37cf,"I mean yeah I guess. We won’t ever know for sure which version was the one Mac would’ve used, but at least imo telescope telescope fit with the other sounds on circles better and was the better version."
122,2020-01-17 22:29:30,eq37cf,"Sure. This is his personal and family friend

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQCRZW62hI

Dude comes off mad aggressive but you can tell he really cared about him and he clearly isn’t over being frustrated about his death"
123,2020-01-21 00:12:44,eq37cf,">. But the whole plan was he was going to go on tour and then, when he came back, we’d go into a large room and I would bring the instrument collection. We basically had an album’s worth of complete songs we had done together. The only things that were left undone were things that we needed to do in a bigger room than I had in Burbank.

This seems like basically what Jon ended up having to do on his own. Which is probably why the project can feel so minimalist at times. I wonder if Shane Powers heard the info at an early date or if he just took it differently. Because he explains it was supposed to be something of a surprise release for the project. Was it gonna be them completeing instrumentation and them releasing it then as a surprise or what? Still some questions"
124,2020-01-17 22:05:13,eq37cf,Awesome. Will definitely watch this. Thanks. Elliott was one of Mac’s favorite artists.
125,2020-01-17 21:46:39,eq37cf,Jesus Christ I didn't know that.
126,2020-01-18 02:21:31,eq37cf,Why the fuck do I keep forgetting to explore Elliott’s music?! Every time I hear anything from him it gives me chills
127,2020-01-17 21:57:01,eq37cf,Could you pm me the link
128,2020-01-17 21:56:24,eq37cf,Random guy here asking for it please!
129,2020-01-17 22:36:23,eq37cf,Never got to listen Telescope. If you wouldn't mind PM me the song would be appreciated!

142,2020-01-18 06:46:58,eq37cf,pm me it bro
143,2020-01-18 17:52:07,eq37cf,Dude please please pm me. Ive been looking everywhere for it
144,2020-01-18 00:14:44,eq37cf,Can I get it too lol
145,2020-01-17 22:27:24,eq37cf,I disagree but I love both and glad we even get any of this.
146,2020-01-18 05:50:13,eq37cf,"Yo this is crazy, apparently the guy who actually did i think mixing/prod for the song said the leaked version wasn’t real and was made i guess from stems of the song somehow

https://twitter.com/idlabsmusic/status/1218155741749575681?s=21

And he even says himself the actual Mac version is basically how it is on the album"
147,2020-01-17 23:09:09,eq37cf,"Sweet man, thanks for the share, really gives more context to the tracks and the state of mind he was in"
148,2020-01-18 00:43:38,eq37cf,"Great share, thanks for that. You can tell how upset he is about it. ""I fucking told him he's not immortal. I know you think you are but you're not. You can FUCKING DIE... And he fucking died."" God damn"
149,2020-01-18 06:32:51,eq37cf,"Ah shit, that’s Shane Powers of Survivor fame! Awesome."
150,2020-01-17 23:00:11,eq37cf,Could I get it from you?
151,2020-01-17 22:33:18,eq37cf,Yeah at the end of the day both are good and we still ended up getting both anyways
152,2020-01-18 07:56:03,eq37cf,Well I’ll be dammed lol. That’s fucking crazy. Whoever made telescope needs to make some real beats cause the beat to that is so good. Definitely changes my opinions on woods a little though if i’m being honest.
153,2020-01-18 02:04:07,eq37cf,"Shit hit hard, hope dude is able to find the place where he just remembers Mac with a smile like he wishes."
154,2020-01-17 16:19:14,eq28fr,Wow so much work goes into these songs that people don’t realize
155,2020-01-17 17:22:40,eq28fr,"""I couldn't believe the songwriting. I looked forward to his visits so much because every time, there was this new discovery of, ‘You're hiding this?’ Honestly. I don't know what else he's got undercover""

Love this. Exactly how I feel about Mac. His talents would always amaze me every time I would hear something new. He constantly pushed the limits of genres. Miss you Mac."
156,2020-01-17 16:11:12,eq28fr,MAC MILLER FOREVER
157,2020-01-17 16:31:46,eq28fr,"Wow, this is so cool. I love how this makes you feel like you were there when this was created. Beautiful!"
158,2020-01-17 16:27:38,eq28fr,Most Dope.
159,2020-01-17 18:50:16,eq28fr,What makes the album so great is the fact that every song has so much intention behind it. Every lyric is poignant and the instrumentals fit so well behind each track. I love this album so god damn much
160,2020-01-18 01:51:49,eq28fr,"This was kind of tough to read. I'm glad Jon got to finish it though, it sounds like he really was invested in making the album Mac would have wanted to make, not the album Jon would've wanted. This whole thing was handled perfectly between Macs family and Jon himself. Rest in Paradise Mac, your spirit lives on through your music every day."
161,2020-01-17 21:02:09,eq28fr,Bawled my eyes out at his quote on Once A Day :( fuck I miss him
162,2020-01-17 19:44:10,eq28fr,Yes. Final versions are much better. Woods is way better than telescope.
163,2020-01-17 19:01:45,eq28fr,Wow
164,2020-01-17 20:48:01,eq28fr,This was a great read. Beautiful how he captured once a day for us. Thanks for sharing!
165,2020-01-18 05:56:35,eq28fr,Wow was talking with my brother about how ‘once a day’ is the perfect ending to the album because it feels so raw and unpolished and just entirely from him. And there it is. I loved reading all of this so much. Reading about how it was torture and excitement to hear what he was capable of although he’s not here shattered my heart but I think it’s how we were all feeling listening today.
166,2020-01-17 19:31:38,eq28fr,[removed]
167,2020-01-18 03:26:05,eq28fr,I felt the same. Usually I feel like there are some filler songs in an album but I don’t feel that way about Circles at all. Every song is beautiful.
168,2020-01-17 20:44:54,eq28fr,"I'm in the other boat, prefer telescope and guitar case."
169,2020-01-18 02:05:44,eq28fr,I actually enjoy them both for different reasons. Really happy I got the leaks feel like they are like being in the room with Mac..
170,2020-01-17 21:33:49,eq28fr,"Yeah I agree I really like woods still don’t get me wrong and maybe I’m just bias because it’s what I heard first but I prefer telescope. I also prefer the original that’s on me, again doesn’t mean I don’t like the album versions."
171,2020-01-18 02:11:33,eq28fr,I wonder if there are og versions to the other tracks like complications that we might get in the future..
172,2020-01-18 02:09:16,eq28fr,"I agree 100% 
So much more emotion in the og leaks but nice to have a studio version as well..they change the mood of the song so much we are lucky to have both"

As I’m cautiously optimistic about the new Strokes album this list made me go back and listen to Voidz - Virtue. I liked it when it came out but it’s even better than I remembered. I’d probably take it over any non-Strokes Julian Casablancas work or the last two Strokes albums.

I love Beach House and all 7 of their albums...i definitely feel in the minority that wouldn’t rank “Bloom” in their top 3. I’m surprised “Teen Dream” didn’t get more votes

Carrie & Lowell is a masterpiece, glad to see it make top 5

For me personally Lonerism > Currents

Glad to see Purple Mountains crack the top 50. Such a heavy album, I think it’s appreciation will grow even more with time. 


I need to give Helplessness Blues another listen. I’m surprised to see it so high on the list. I didn’t dislike it but haven’t gone back to it much and preferred their first and Crack-Up 

Many of my favorite artists of the last decade(Grizzly Bear, Beach House, Mac Demarco, FJM, Sufjan, Tame Impala) are represented on this list but the biggest one for me that isn’t is Timber Timbre. Maybe they’re just not as well know around these parts but I hope more people check them out if they’re not aware of them. “Creep on Creepin’ On” is my favorite of theirs and a top 10 of the decade for me.

the top 3 is a little surprising for an ""indie"" sub but they are obviously some of the defining albums of the 2010s so it's hard to be mad. i've been thinking that most music listeners pick one of those three in their top 20 of the decade (for me it's *blonde*) and that's why these always rise to the top as consensus picks. but i don't know if there are many people that list all of those as their top 3 or even top 20 of the decade

EDIT EDIT: it looks like björk has been mistakenly omitted from this list, i'm less disappointed in this sub. *vulnicura* is marked as a duplicate album in the spreadsheet when it is her first appearance the list. i don't care if the post is modified, that would be too much work. but for anyone interested, she is tied with japanese breakfast and pj harvey"

Robyn - Body Talk (6th)

Solange - A Seat at the Table (8th)

Rihanna - ANTI (9th)

David Bowie - Blackstar (10th)

They were probably played the most along with Free Energy's Stuck on Nothing.

I think Teen Dream was a more original album and its release was probably more significant. That being said, I think Bloom is a more refined record with higher highs (I mean... *Myth)* and has virtually no lows (neither does TD, but you get what I mean). Bloom expands on TD's sound & (in my opinion) perfects it.

Every now and then I hear her played on 6 music and go 'oh yeah!', but otherwise I rarely come back to it.

My personal highest rated women are SOPHIE at #6, followed by Bjork at #7, and Grimes at #20, Joanna Newsom at #26, and Julia Holter at #31. Marginally better, but still admittedly very male dominated. There may be some unconscious biases at play, but I do go out of my way to seek out female led music - maybe I just find more resonance with stuff that is familiar to me (though I do question that theory, as I probably have more common in my personal experiences with someone like Julia Holter than someone like Kendrick...)."

I think the hyper-personal narrative of IGOR really appealed to people though, that plus the vulnerability it hit on both emotionally and in Tyler using his singing voice a lot more.

364,2020-03-23 18:01:48,fnhuu7,"TPAB - fairly accessible (incl some solid radio-friendly singles); it’s themes are complex enough to engage almost anyone but not too much for most listeners to understand; diverse yet cohesive sound/production; Kendrick’s a flow master; made by an already-popular artist so it reached more ears, therefore an option for more lists."
365,2020-03-23 13:55:58,fnhuu7,"Woah woah woah, under what circumstances is *ANTI* one of the fifteen best albums of the decade!? It has a 73 on Metacritic and finished twelfth in Metacritic’s own compendium of 2016 lists. *Body Talk* was much more well-received in score, but it finished eighteenth in their conglomerated listing in 2010.

End of decade listings can easily be thrown off by pop appeal. For one, attention is much more scattered: *Anti* appeared on nine lists, which is good, but do those nine publications then overwrite the opinions of everyone who did not include it? But more relevantly, we see *Born to Die* at #14 (62 critical rating), then Taylor Swift’s *Red* (77), then Taylor Swift’s *1989* (76). The list also features Adele’s *21* (76) and Carly Rae Jepsen’s *Emotion*. So is it sexism, or is it simply a lesser interest is mass commerciality and pop sound? Jepsen aside, who I think we can all acknowledge is a significant exception in this community, it seems rather clear that the issue is more with the style of music.

I agree that both *Lemonade* and *Body Talk* deserved to be included, and specifically *Body Talk* is grossly under-appreciated here. But if you want to make a valid point about the subreddit’s sexism (which to be clear is absolutely present), tie your cart to a better horse than, “Wow, Adele and Taylor Swift were *robbed* because of *sexism*.” And I think it is telling you deliberately excluded their names to make your point.

EDIT: Frankly, I think you might have a better claim that the subreddit is specifically biased against *black women* when you look at Metacritic’s own rating system. \#JusticeForNoname"
366,2020-03-23 14:02:48,fnhuu7,"I think the discussion surrounding women in music is super interesting and it's leading me to think about unconscious bias both on a macro-scale and individually for myself. For example, I had only one female artist in my top 20 list (Alvvays) and they're only half-female, proving I need to expand my horizons a great deal. There are a lot of female artists I've been digging into during the last year or so (Julien Baker, SZA, Mitski, Beach House [?], etc.) but none sat with me long enough to quite break top 20. 

That being said, I think the exclusion of Rihanna/Robyn/Beyonce is more to do with the fact they're pop rather than women. That's just my two cents. (apologies in advance if I misinterpreted your point)"
367,2020-03-23 13:59:47,fnhuu7,Well its an indie sub so Beyonce and Rhianna not being on it make sense lol. Otherwise yea its odd Robyn didnt make it.

The hype surrounding them is real though. They make some of the best music ever created imo."
371,2020-03-23 13:49:42,fnhuu7,Even if you don't listen to rap you can't appreciate songs like These Walls and Wesley's Theory?
372,2020-03-23 14:17:11,fnhuu7,"I am close to this sentiment as well. I like hip hop – jazzier stuff like Nujabes or golden age era. But, I have a hard time getting into artists like Kendirck Lamar. I also don't mind autotune in some music like late 90's euro dance, trance, house, but in today's hip hop or pop scene it sounds forced to me. I chalk it up to being old and out of the times. 

I imagine in the mid-90's there older folks, like me now, who didn't get emo or Warp records IDM. At the time, I couldn't understand how someone could not like emo or some glitchy IDM."

426,2020-03-23 14:49:21,fnhuu7,"Currents is such a radically different experience for the band that it was inevitably going to create a lot of new fans and split up the fan base. My guess is that a lot of people who voted on it probably ONLY like Currents of those 3 albums, people who generally like synth pop more than psych rock. Or at least they find it the most re-listenable.

As someone who REALLY loves Innerspeaker but put Currents on their list: I can only say I love the approaches of all their albums, but my tastes skew more towards dream pop/electronica aesthetics, meaning this album ends up being the one I go back to the most often. And I can viscerally remember putting on the album for the first time in 2015, not knowing what to expect, and being blown away by the style change."
427,2020-03-23 14:41:34,fnhuu7,Lonerism > Currents by a country mile
428,2020-03-23 12:45:23,fnhuu7,I chose the word top instead of best for a reason.
429,2020-03-23 20:12:56,fnhuu7,"Honestly it's not that bad. 2010 is tied for the second most represented year with 2018 (13 albums) and 2019 is tied for second least with 2014 (8 albums). r/indieheads as a whole seems to really like the stretch from 2016-2018 in music, so I guess we'll see if that holds up into the future or if it is down to recency bias. Personally 2018 and 2010 are definitely my two favorite years of the decade overall."
430,2020-03-23 17:05:12,fnhuu7,"Yikes I don't agree. While there may have been some really strong songs on Lonerism the album as a whole (Currents) is one of the best things to touch this decade, sorry."

432,2020-03-23 13:48:59,fnhuu7,"It's incredible the way that music accessibility has changed in the ten years since HOOM was released. Illegal downloads were so common and widespread at the time that the idea of not listening to an album because it didn't exist on a certain platform would sound crazy.

Where we are now though is a point where there's so much good music that IS available on Spotify Premium that why would somebody take the three hours out of their day to listen to an album that requires extra steps for them to listen to? Streaming platforms have really made it so that albums that are inconvenient to listen to are starting off at a disadvantage. HOOM reflects this most of all, it had the 4th highest number 1 choices of any album but after including artists' second choices, only finished 25th. The people who have heard it love it, but it's probably the least listened to album in our top 50 or so"
433,2020-03-23 16:43:17,fnhuu7,"another part of the unconscious bias thing that might be at play is that björk, joanna newsom, and even fiona apple sometimes have unconventional singing styles. i've found many male friends tell me they just can't get into björk because of her vocals, even though these same guys have little issue listening to men with unconventional or not technically proficient voices.

i agree with your assessment the lack of streaming accessibility certainly makes it harder for me to listen to joanna. i just don't always ability to put on my joanna newsom records and i feel like i'm doing the music a disservice if i try to listen to it in the background.

It was also just a lot easier to listen to than Igor for me. Maybe I’m a simple person that doesn’t like to be too challenged by my music. I don’t know. Just give me something easy to listen to.

I guess I didn't read the fine print, is that why I got that washing machine delivered to my place?"
455,2020-03-23 15:16:39,fnhuu7,"Ohh okay, I was about to say."
456,2020-03-23 11:52:50,fnhuu7,"This will be a hot take and I feel like some might be offended by my comment, having said that.

You wanted 51 out of 102 to be female? To me it sounds like some people would rather vote for female artists just because they are female rather than vote for the art they have made. I honestly don't agree with this argument because it invalidates them as artists and just uses them for being female.

Don't get me wrong, I love plenty of female artists, but for this list I only voted in 3 female artists out of the 20 (my top 3 albums of 2019 had 2 female artists however). Nothing against the plenty of other female albums I loved but I prefered the ones I voted over them and I won't vote for an artist just because they are female.

Art made by women is different than man's art, it has a different point of view of the world and it translates into their art, music is no different from any other art form in this regard but I would love for their art to be appreciated. It's disregarding female artist because you are only considering them for being female. To support feminism we should appreciate their art more. If you want to compare female art to male art, do it on the same term, there should be equality in this regard.

As a final point, the music industry, unfortunately, is male dominant and it's still a scary place for women that aren't in a place of power (there's still plenty of sexism), but that makes it so there are more male musicians out there, that translates to ratio of male/female musicians that made it into this list and we should not exclude male artists just because they aren't female.

I wish the media would start properly supporting female artists as to inspire even more female artists but they need to stop glorifying the fact that they are female and stop selling feminism (because it really is just them baiting for clicks) and start contemplating the art they are producing.

I apologise for the random testament out of nowhere."
457,2020-03-23 15:24:45,fnhuu7,"Wait, are you saying that's a bad thing? Considering most of them are solo artists, that's a way better representation than I ever anticipated."

465,2020-03-23 14:13:32,fnhuu7,"It's still weird to see so many non indie artists on the list, especially at the top."
466,2020-03-23 12:57:03,fnhuu7,Correct. It just proves that indie music isn’t that good when the music that self-professed indieheads love most isn’t even indie.
467,2020-03-23 13:01:18,fnhuu7,Fair enough!
468,2020-03-23 14:55:35,fnhuu7,"Yeah, once the voting pool gets wide enough it becomes more about very-good albums everyone can tolerate, because those accumulate points by being on the most lists"

470,2020-03-23 19:30:00,fnhuu7,Those albums are all innovative and timeless classics though.  Personally I don't feel anything from Kanye or Kendrick fits that mold.. obviously some people do but I don't get it.
471,2020-03-23 14:28:59,fnhuu7,"Review averages are very bad for determining the ""top"" albums for a year or decade. Critic lists are direct representations of which albums critics thought were the *best*, and Metacritic agrees with AOTY that ANTI was the 8th best of the decade. 

It's true that popular albums get an unfair bump from these critic lists, but it doesn't change the fact that these very same lists put Kendrick, Kanye, and Frank at the top AND SO DID WE. Why does the sub love them but not the Knowles sisters? Popularity is not the key distinction here.

(Also worth noting that review averages are biased against popular albums because popular albums get a lot more reviews. Reviewers are less likely to bother to write pans for albums that relatively unknown.)"
472,2020-03-23 14:35:41,fnhuu7,">Well its an indie sub so Beyonce and Rhianna not being on it make sense lol.

By that logic a lot of other artists shouldn't have made the list."
473,2020-03-23 14:34:04,fnhuu7,"Why, because they're popular? Kendrick, Kanye, and Frank are popular. 

I think the point is that despite their popularity, it's still ""cool"" to like these guys but it's somehow less cool to like Beyonce and Rihanna. I mean, Beyonce has collaborated with all 3 of them, and Rihanna has collaborated with 2 of them, but we're going to pretend like they're in some totally different genre?"

“I was poor now I rich”

“That girl like to talk / But that bitch needs my cock.”

starts happening."

477,2020-03-23 17:10:29,fnhuu7,"I really do like hip hop but it tends to be from the glory days of rap. I grew up on Three Six Mafia, Project Pat, Eminem, Dr Dre, Snoop. I just relistened to To Pimp A Butterfly for like the 10th time. Just doesn't appeal to me (and that's ok, it doesn't strike everybody). My problem is that I typically have this issue where if I don't see what everyone else is seeing I feel like I'm missing out. I've had bands that I didn't get before (like MGMT with Congratulations) but I force listen 5-10 times and I feel like I have a ding ding ding moment. Just hasn't happened with this. Again, I think I'm just too old, too critical of things, growing into a rut and it's sad."
478,2020-03-23 14:35:11,fnhuu7,GKMC better than TPAB
479,2020-03-23 13:52:49,fnhuu7,"This take is fucking freezing.

DAMN and especially GKMC are 2 of the greatest hip hop albums ever made, along with TPAB. Kendrick is an incredible rapper and storyteller. Hes literally the perfect rapper imaginable. Section 80 and even his first mixtape and overly dedicated are great as well but really not in the same conversation as those 3."

483,2020-03-23 14:38:01,fnhuu7,I don't know what you're arguing really. The only reason he lists two Mitski albums is because they tied and we only do one album per artist. And the person you're replying to is talking about it being a crowd-pleasing list but you just listed a bunch of albums that are also super acclaimed and mainstream as well.

* Arcade Fire
* Sufjan Stevens 
* The National
* Bon Iver
* Vampire Weekend

* Beach House
* MGMT
* Arctic Monkeys

508,2020-03-23 14:55:59,fnhuu7,"See, I never bought Currents being that big of a stylistic change as Lonerism was already synth heavy and Kevin’s songwriting already leaned towards pop too. The poorman’s Phil Collins ballad of Cause I’m a Man was new I guess and it’s a bit less guitar heavy (though they were rarely ever shredders or anything), but everything wasn’t too far off from what he was already doing. That said, the general approach really underscored a lot of his faults: thin voice, crappy lyrics, the overcompensation of loudness over songwriting, etc. 

I get the idea that Currents is maybe more in line with broader tastes, but man I really can’t imagine being that impressed with it."
509,2020-03-23 14:42:28,fnhuu7,I just realised Innerspeaker was also released within the time period. Currents above those two is controversial

511,2020-03-23 13:01:18,fnhuu7,"eh, I was more curious that most of it seems skewed towards the last 5 years, which would explain Lonerism and Innerspeaker's absence, rather than best/top nitpicking. Though there's albums outside of that frame too, so I'm still mostly just wondering what the fuck in general."

513,2020-03-23 14:07:37,fnhuu7,"I couldn’t agree more. I fucking love Jay-Z but barely listened to him for a decade because he wasn’t easily accessible in the moments I listened to music most. 

I actually bought a couple of his albums digitally (which I never do anymore, I only stream and buy vinyl - this was a notable exception), but the mere fact they were in a different app meant I never bothered to listen to them. It sounds insanely lazy (which it probably is), but because I didn’t see those albums listed next to the rest of my body of music they just never popped into my head. There was always something more directly vying for my attention in any given moment.

Now he’s back on Spotify I’m listening to him loads again, but it really is out of sight out of mind these days."
514,2020-03-23 14:52:39,fnhuu7,">Illegal downloads were so common and widespread at the time that the idea of not listening to an album because it didn't exist on a certain platform would sound crazy.

516,2020-03-23 16:16:01,fnhuu7,"I was a relatively early adopter of Spotify and was using it in 2010, and not listening to an album because it's not on Spotify or some other streaming service is insane to me. I actually remember doing a Spotify search for Joanna in 2010 and only finding The Roots song she was sampled on, but that didn't stop me from listening to her. All her music was available on Youtube, and of course there was downloading too. I don't think there was that much of a difference in terms ease of access back then, people have just gotten to attached to their streaming platforms of choice. Also you can use local files to listen to music that's not available on Spotify on Spotify, so it really isn't inconvenient at all."
517,2020-03-23 18:15:12,fnhuu7,"That’s interesting. I think the most obvious commonality for me between most of the female artists I like is the experimental (or at least unconventional) nature of their music. Looking at my list, there’s quite a lot of “safe but well executed” male musicians, but all of the female ones have very distinct styles. Maybe it’s a case of me (unconsciously) holding women to a higher standard to stand out. Interesting.

Anyway, my full list is here - https://rateyourmusic.com/list/felixjmorgan/felixjmorgans-top-100-albums-of-the-2010s/

523,2020-03-24 12:01:49,fnhuu7,"I'm not offended but I just find your comment incredibly preachy and ridiculous. 

Contrary to what *I think* you're implying, liking female-fronted music equally or more than male-fronted one isn't patronizing or doing it for the sake of feminism, political-correctness, etc. I, for example, and a lot of people outside of this sub's bubble, rank female albums highly on our lists because we genuinely appreciate and love them, not because of some need for women to be represented. Lastly, why must the result of ""careful examination and appreciation of art"" being an overwhelmingly male-dominated music ranking be the norm we should just accept??? ""Music ranking with equal distribution between women and men"" = pandering but ""Music ranking with more men than women"" = proper vetting of the female albums that were lucky enough to be included?

This sub's music taste is just irrevocably white and male, period. No need to jump through hoops and loops trying to defend it. It *could* look sketchy to some people, but no one could police a whole community's taste. Heck, if r/popheads (a sub I frequent more that r/indieheads) did a decade-end ranking, 90% of the albums will be non-cis male lol"
524,2020-03-23 11:59:51,fnhuu7,"I want people to simply vote for their favourite albums exactly as they should on a poll like this. I also think that there was more than enough quality output from female artists this decade - especially within the indie scene - that on a poll this large, on a forum dedicated to the topic, there should be more than *29%* representation for the *entire decade*. With ~600 votes of 20 albums each on this thing, I can't see how that result isn't at least a *little* indicative of some gender-bias."
525,2020-03-23 12:04:36,fnhuu7,What are you on about?  Are you trying to say that there aren't at least 50 albums made by women that are good enough to be on this list?  This whole list could be made up of female artists and be significantly better.

528,2020-03-24 12:50:56,fnhuu7,"Oof. Owie. Ouch. I love Time’n’Place. But I 大好き Bonito Generation. In other words, it’s apples and oranges to me. Creatively speaking though, time n place pushes those boundaries. I love how puts forward the unsettling side of their music... I couldn’t get enough of rest stop or the end of only acting. That being said, I love the digestibility of BG. And how the lyrics are a bit longing for childhood even if your an adult. It resonated with me. That album also was part of the reason I moved to japan. If I had to pick one, I’d pick BG. I’m glad we both resonate with different parts of their work. That’s cool. KKB is awesome and when I saw them live it was one of the craziest and most lit shows I ever attended."

531,2020-03-23 20:41:04,fnhuu7,"They do, ESPECIALLY that Kendrick album, which had an impact beyond music. People were chanting those songs at black lives matter protests. The Kanye album (think him humming the second half of Runaway) and Kendrick album were genre-bending and novel releases. Frank just released perfect music and his shit will go down as classics for sure, just like the greats of the 60s and 70s."
532,2020-03-23 14:43:57,fnhuu7,"If you ask the average, shall we say, “critically” minded listener, Metacritic’s highest scoring albums would trend much closer with what is considered “good” than appeals to popularity. Metacritic’s aggregate is drawing from the same sources, so no kidding it matches. My point is that you are basically saying nine publications liked *Anti* in an all or nothing format, therefore top ten album of the decade. That is not sensible or valuable – *especially* factoring in the goal of attracting “clicks” and this catering to popular attention. Again, if you want to die on this hill, you basically need to be arguing that *Born to Die* and *21* and *Red* are better albums than *The Idler Wheel* and *Let England Shake* and *Room 25*. You really think that is your best line of approach?

What is much more valuable is *Anti*’s score based on 31 precise critical opinions. When you only look at top tens, you exclude everything negative. In the eyes of critics, those actually acclaimed albums I mentioned have much more unanimity in their perception. It is not a matter of listbait; those were the assessments. All you are arguing now is that a bunch of pop albums (and Solange kind-of) were robbed because of sexism, which is an *extremely* weak foundation. Like I said, you would be much better off looking at Noname’s exclusion and Jamila Woods’ exclusion and Little Simz’s exclusion and Rapsody’s exclusion, all despite a prevalent recency bias, and tying that into your point about the Knowles(es?); at least then it cannot be easily dismissed by questions of genre (obviously the subreddit is fine with hip-hop in some abstract sense, albeit apparently only hip-hop white people find accessible) or excessive commercialisation.

Robyn continues to be the weird one; this subreddit loves Jepsen and Chvrches and Grimes and Charli and Sky Ferreira and Bjork and Janelle Monae, so I have no idea how Robyn goes ignored."
533,2020-03-23 14:38:04,fnhuu7,"Eh. There are popular artists on the list but not pop artists on the level of those 2. The popular artists on this list are definitely more hip hop oriented.

Like 80-90% of this list is probably not on the not on the average persons radar...at all. That doesnt leave a lot of room for Be and Rhianna ha."
534,2020-03-23 16:09:17,fnhuu7,"I mean they are completely different genres to me. The type of lyrically-focused, genre-bending hip hop Kendrick makes, experimental/progressive hip hop Kanye makes and R&B that Frank makes is completely different than the poppier hip hop that Beyonce and Rhianna make. Sure, not as different as like Tim McGraw but still very different. Not that pop is bad at all, and Emotion was on the list. But indie fans definitely aren't as big into it as the others genres for a number of valid reasons, and that's fine."
535,2020-03-24 21:24:43,fnhuu7,"I'll bite assuming this is well intended. There are tons. I'm not that into hiphop either but Noname, Ka, milo, and Brother Ali are all rappers I dig that would fit this description. Now, if you can't stand to hear a single curse word... then maybe you are better off with Christian rap which I can't help with. 

If your issue is generally with the lyrical content, my casual observation has been that a certain segment of music listener population (non-rap fans / white folks / non-native english speakers) first take an interest in hiphop through artists like Atmosphere or Immortal Technique who are deemed ""accessible"" sonically and have a lot of tracks that focus on storytelling in a much more upfront manner. The challenge with a lot of hiphop is how self referential it is and how nuanced the lyrics can be, which poses a big entry barrier not unlike electronic music poses to someone who only has experience with analog rock music. 

If you liked the jazzy element of TPAB and you don't necessarily require something more ""accessible"" lyrically or melodically, you might dig the album Some Rap Songs by Earl Sweatshirt or the artist milo I mentioned above who does art rap / spoken word.

Edit: Had to go in and add Noname since she was my favorite rapper of the decade."
536,2020-03-24 23:24:37,fnhuu7,Not really what im saying? But if they cant get into Frank Ocean or Kendrick Lamar and said they arent sure they like hip hop they probably dont like hip hop. Is there a better entry point for modern hip hop than those two lol?
537,2020-03-24 01:13:19,fnhuu7,Id argue we’re in the glory days of rap.
538,2020-03-23 17:15:22,fnhuu7,"I will say TPAB is arguably the least accessible of anything those guys have put out. It spans like 10 genres and certainly takes some getting used to. Maybe start with DAMN or Section 80. Try songs like Blow My High, GOD or even Gowing aaprt on Overly Dedicated. Kendrick makes such a range of styles so I guarantee theres something for you to latch onto."

The thing is, no hip hop community will ever do that because hip hop is a pretty well-segmented part of music. The problem for this sub is that the definition of indie is a really tough line to walk. Blonde was released independently but it's one of the most well-known and well-acclaimed albums of the decade, whereas Radiohead released A Moon Shaped Pool on the same label Adele is on. Overall, removing artists would be tough to define and it would all depend on the label they're signed to which isn't a good enough reason to remove someone from the list imo"

561,2020-03-24 12:31:48,fnhuu7,"I don't believe you understood my point. I'm not saying you can't like female artists more than male artists, my point is that if your sole reason for voting for a female artist over a male one for this list is the fact that she is female, you are not taking into account their art, from either artist, you are just voting due to her sex. It diminishes the art of the female artist because you are not taking in account her hard work and passion towards her project.

And I did state that if you truly enjoy a female album more than a male one, vote for it! That's what I'm arguing here, you should vote for what you enjoy the most and not due to their sex. And it's good that you rank female albums higher because you appreciate them and enjoy them more than the others. But my comment was not towards you but towards people that felt a need there should be 50/50 male/female in this list when the music industry isn't 50/50 but rather male dominant and would push out some great albums by male artists, just to push some feminism into the list. I'm saying look at all the artists the same way, no matter the skin tone, sex, sexual preference, and vote for their art.

As a last point, is it that abnormal that the majority of us listen to mostly white, male artists? Those are the ones that mostly make the type of music we listen to. Regardless, the top 3 albums voted were by african americans, if there was a bias towards caucasians, they wouldn't be voted on the top and why should we vote against female artists as well?"
562,2020-03-23 12:44:19,fnhuu7,"I guess I'm confused. You want people to vote purely for what they believe are their favorite albums of the decade, but you're still disappointed with the results based on gender outcome?

Why does an artists' gender matter? Same question for race/sexual orientation/nationality/political affiliation etc?"
563,2020-03-23 12:06:17,fnhuu7,"According to the census, only 12.4% of indieheads users are female and there are 29% female artists featured in this list. But I think it's a coincidence. I think the core indieheads community isn't gender-bias in general.

And like I stated, there's still a large ratio of male/female bands in favor of male bands in the industry, so I do believe it's normal that it's not 50/50. There's a better chance that there is better music from male artists because there are more male artists.

edit: I've been crazy this year trying to discover new music. I have a [Spotify Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7BhZxNu7fCTA2qEq5Uc1JV?si=y5Jmoqj4T7-a-POAnRlU8w), featuring songs released in 2020, one limited per artist. I mostly use this subreddit to find songs (even fresh posts with 10 upvotes, I will check). I just counted. I have 122 songs and 42 of those are female (led, full or a main singer) band. I add every song I enjoyed to later check on their album, I do not leave out female bands but it's what I find. It's about 33%, close to what this list has."

Firstly, I love Hinds, I have been a fan of theirs for a while. But would you vote on Hinds' *Leave Me Alone* over Fleet Foxes's *Helpessness Blues*? You're entitled to your opinion, you might actually prefer the album but I would not vote for it and if your argument for voting for Hinds' album is because they are female and Fleet Foxes are not, you are not voting for the album or the art, just voting for the fact they are female and it does not seem like a fair way to vote in my opinion."

I was really happy that my 2019 top 10 albums list was dominated by women because it was such a change of pace from the rest of the decade, but I can't pretend that my favorite music from all 9 other years isn't mostly male, which I believe has much more to do with genre bias than gender bias"

574,2020-03-23 15:23:14,fnhuu7,"We will probably have to agree to disagree on this, but I'll make a couple more points: The /r/indieheads list is compiled by looking at each users ""top albums"" and NOT by looking at ""average album score"" across all users. While there are way more indiehead voters than there are critic lists, it's still true that it would take only a *similarly small fraction* of us to land Rihanna on to the Top 100.

Also, if you look at the critic list aggregates, they seem track our list much better than the metacritic averages (if you ignore the women, of course). 

Another observation: The only men in the AOTY Top 50 list who do not appear on our list are Drake (at 34) and DJ Rashad (at 48). The corresponding list of women is:

Beyonce, Robyn, Rihanna (as mentioned), and also Taylor Swift, Kacey Musgraves, Adele, SZA, and HAIM."

How popular an album is has *nothing* to do with whether it is indie or not. Independent is *not* a ""thin line"". An album is either released by an independent label or a corporate major label. Indie is not a genre and is not hard to figure out at all. 

Bullshit that you'd include a black metal band in a hip hop list just because people nominated it. If people nominate something that doesn't fit the category you ignore that. Albums that don't fit you don't include them."

595,2020-03-23 12:52:43,fnhuu7,Because it can be a sign of unconscious bias to keep preferencing albums by male artists over female.

596,2020-03-23 14:43:50,fnhuu7,"I actually think the fact that this sub is overwhelmingly male actually is the most important factor for this. It's only natural that someone is more likely to enjoy music made by their own gender as they are more likely to identify with it than otherwise. 

I feel like for me personally my time spent listening to male v female artists is probably pretty close to 50/50, but the majority of my FAVORITE albums, whether they're from all time or this decade, are mostly by men. That could be an unconscious bias as others in this thread are suggesting but I think it's equally likely that I'm just gonna have a deeper emotional connection to an album from someone who's perspective on life is more closely aligned with mine. 

I may be wrong but I think if you flipped the demographics of this sub and made it so it was 12.4% male we'd probably see that change mirrored in the number of female artists in the top 100."

In that case, the small fraction of true indiehead feminists should have been enough to support such an undeniably great album, no? Again, simplest solution is the subreddit is not drawn to that music. Several of my favourites also failed to receive recognition (Michael Kiwanuka, the Roots, a bunch of underground hip-hop...), but I can acknowledge this subreddit is generally more shifted to a certain type of music, with some overlap with the pop and hip-hop spheres.

>	Also, if you look at the critic list aggregates, they seem track our list much better than the metacritic averages (if you ignore the women, of course).

Ehhhh, I think there is a lot of room to quibble with that assessment, but to the extent it is accurate, that can reflect the notions of “popularity” which still exist at the top *aside from* the subreddit’s perspectives of non-synthy pop music.

>! Another observation: The only men in the AOTY Top 50 list who do not appear on our list are Drake (at 34) and DJ Rashad (at 48).

Both of whom I would argue are very much not in line with this subreddit’s musical interests, with Drake being especially poppy.

Also, DJ Rashad is another weird inclusion, but at #48 I am guessing that means he shows up on like three lists, right?

>	The corresponding list of women is: Beyonce, Robyn, Rihanna (as mentioned), and also Taylor Swift, Kacey Musgraves, Adele, SZA, and HAIM.

RnB pop, synth pop (again, baffling exclusion by comparison with other synth pop acts), RnB pop, pop, country pop (reasonably well received here at the time, but hardly the most loved genre), pop, RnB/hip-hop (see: the like eight exclusions in this genre I mentioned), and indie pop (another mildly surprising exclusion). In terms of critical acclaim, you could mostly narrow that to Beyoncé, Robyn (still weird), Kacey, and SZA, plus everyone I brought up, at which point the “black women” angle seems a lot stronger. (But even then, maybe this subreddit simply has no interest in RnB not performed by Frank Ocean.) Again, it feels like you kind-of need to be ignoring all the women who were included but were not covered by decade lists for this theory to work, rather than going with the simplest explanations."
604,2020-03-23 15:07:47,fnhuu7,"Yeah. But Kanye and especially that album are adored by critics, popular music and indie fans alike. Him bridging those gaps is the reason why hes the biggest name in music.

605,2020-03-24 22:50:34,fnhuu7,"You might really like the Common album Black America Again. It's sort of exactly what you are looking for and came out post TPAB when a couple of artists did stuff in a similar vein.

608,2020-03-23 15:35:28,fnhuu7,Yeah US club culture diverged in the hip hop direction at some point instead of being more ravey. At least from observation I’m not a club person at all lol
609,2020-03-23 15:41:30,fnhuu7,Honestly I probably don't know enough about labels to say which labels are indie and which aren't. It just seems like a somewhat arbitrary distinction to make between indie labels and mainstream labels when we're voting about music.
610,2020-03-23 15:37:13,fnhuu7,"This isn't a category though, it's a community. If we're making a list of the top hip hop albums, then I definitely wouldn't include the black metal album. But if a hip hop community got together and all voted on their favorite albums, regardless of genre or anything, and a black metal album ended up on that list, then I'd include it.  

That's what this list is supposed to be, the top albums of the decade as voted by indieheads, not the top indie albums. You can disagree about the decision to do that but I think it's fine. If there's albums that crossover to different communities and categories why not let them on the list?"

It's an essentialist way of thinking that men would somehow connect more with music made by men just because they're men. I'm female and I have absolutely no trouble connecting with music made by male artists, and I don't think I like female musicians anymore because they're female. We're all humans, after all. Joanna Newsom is my favourite artist, but I don't think that has anything to do with her being a woman - she's just the best. Besides, I think truly great artists transcend all of that and are able to connect with people who are completely different from them. My top 10 ended up being 4/10 female and 6/10 male and I think that's true of all those albums. If you have problem with connecting with female artists, that's your problem."

Our main disagreement is that I happen to think one measurement makes this point better than the other, but I think both are relevant. (Whereas you think one measurement can be used for this demonstration while the other is invalid.)"
624,2020-03-26 15:16:18,fnhuu7,Noname was exactly what I was looking for. I think I prefer the less busy style of rap.
625,2020-03-24 23:24:34,fnhuu7,"Awesome thanks again, I have the ability to listen to whatever I want at work, so I will check out a couple of these albums tomorrow."
626,2020-03-25 01:33:53,fnhuu7,Not really. I didn't like hip hop like a couple of years ago and Kendrick's music didn't change my mind at all.
627,2020-03-23 16:37:33,fnhuu7,its cuz Americans cant dance (me included :/ )
628,2020-03-23 15:49:18,fnhuu7,"Some people don't want to support anything they don't have to that's affiliated with the tiny amount of major multinational corporations of the world for reasons that have to do with censorship and diversity and for lots of other reasons I could go off about but won't. It is a political thing that has always been important in the DIY punk scene. 

Like I said, a lot of people very understandably mix up ""alternative"" with indie. But that is out of their own ignorance. I totally understand if someone doesn't care about what kind of label releases an album but if people are going to think of themselves as ""indieheads"" it is probably to their benefit to understand what the term ""indie""  designates. *It's not a random genre of music. It means independent artists. Independently released music. Plain and simple.*"
629,2020-03-23 15:39:28,fnhuu7,I don't disagree with your choice to include what you want in your list but I *do* kind of laugh at people who use a term to describe themselves that they obviously don't really understand.
630,2020-03-23 16:14:42,fnhuu7,"Indie means the same thing it always has, whether some people understand it or not. Yes, as I explained in another comment on here people don't really care about whether artists are independent or corporate anymore the way they did back in the 90s but it doesn't change what indie means. Alternative and indie *are not* the same thing. I'm sorry that something gave you the mistaken impression otherwise. Here's a shocker: Words have meanings!"
631,2020-03-23 22:14:28,fnhuu7,That's so interesting that your favourite Tame song is on your least favourite album. I know what you mean about Let it Happen though - they have such a habit of over promising albums with banging openers.
632,2020-03-23 15:27:03,fnhuu7,"Well it doesn't actually say ""people who call themselves indie music fans but who don't understand what indie means"" like it should, but I guess you're right."
633,2020-03-23 14:48:57,fnhuu7,"RYM is fundamentally a musical rating site, not an art rating site. Musically, the Minecraft soundtrack is weaker than say, Helplessness Blues. It's great, don't get me wrong, but it doesn't come close to the complexity and scale of other 2011 albums."
634,2020-03-23 13:59:44,fnhuu7,"Yes that’s clearly what I’m suggesting. Every time someone talks about unconscious bias there’s always a galaxy brain take about how this won’t end until we just judge music by identity and not by sound and how people are shaming you for not listening to music by minorities.

Another person replied to me in part of the thread about how they couldn’t even name many albums by female artists. A singular response isn’t indicative of anything, but when this subreddit consistently in pollls preferences male artists over female artists. I think it’s becoming more and more indicative. And I think that’s a valid discussion point on a subreddit about indie music. Individually, listen to whatever you want etc. but if as a community we’re limiting ourselves to music of a certain background and missing out on vibrant music by other people then I think that’s something important to consider."
635,2020-03-23 13:22:18,fnhuu7,"I don't think anyone is claiming that people should be pressured to choose female artists or anything like that, vibe i'm getting from the convo is that the list indicates a non-malicious bias, which it slightly does.

However just because it's indicated doesn't mean it actually exists."
636,2020-03-23 19:45:33,fnhuu7,"I really don't think I have any problem with connecting with female artists, like I said I think if I actually surveyed my time listening to music I would find the split between time spent listening to male/female artists would be pretty close to 50/50, it's just that the stuff that I identify with strongly enough to consider it one of my favorites of all time I think is more likely to come from someone with my actual shared perspective. 

Like, to use an analogy, I think if I said ""As a guy the majority of my best friends are guys as I can identify with them more girls,"" I would guess most people would say that makes sense. That's not to say that all of my best friends are guys, but the majority of them are going to be."
637,2020-03-23 15:15:30,fnhuu7,"Wow had no idea, but this in itself sounds intriguing, I’ll have to check them out!"
638,2020-03-23 13:01:10,fnhuu7,Lol that’s really a sign you should be listening to more shit then.
639,2020-03-23 16:16:33,fnhuu7,"I do not think the other is *automatically* invalid, I just think there is a much, much more obvious explanation for the exclusion given the disparity in both critical scores and genre. It is why I keep highlighting that Robyn’s specific absence is weird, because she at least tracks with the subreddit’s genre interests. And I am not sure there is inherently some bias against black women, but it is a lot easier to ascribe a bias against RnB / Soul / feminine hip-hop to passive bias against black women than it is to ascribe a bias against pop to bias against women as a whole. In fact, I think it is pretty reductive and dismissive of all the traditionally indie women who are on the list."
640,2020-03-26 15:53:03,fnhuu7,Telefone by Noname is literally one of my two top hiphop records of the decade and it's the only hiphop I like to spin on weekend mornings. Highly recommend the whole album.
641,2020-03-23 15:48:20,fnhuu7,"Yeah if I'm honest I haven't delved into research about labels much. I know it surprised me when I heard that A Moon Shaped Pool was released on the label that Adele's on, and Frank Ocean's been talked about enough on this sub that I know that whole situation.  

Maybe indie has a good definition, but I don't know the difference between an indie label and a mainstream one enough to categorize it, and it seems kinda arbitrary to me when we're supposed to be talking about the music.  

And just as an aside, none of the top 10 albums were in my personal list, so I don't really have any bias towards them. In fact, I'm kinda sick of seeing MBDTF and TPAB on lists, even if they are both good, important albums."
642,2020-03-23 16:24:56,fnhuu7,[deleted]
643,2020-03-23 17:20:55,fnhuu7,"I disagree with your last point. Again it seems you me you're not taking into account the ratio of male to female musicians. It's a male dominant industry. I highly doubt there are any bands people listen to here just because they are male, why would you do that for female bands? If you enjoy it, go ahead.

Like I said in another comment, I've been looking for new music like crazy this year, so far I have a playlist with 122 songs (one per artist) released this year. 42 are female. I tend to listen to all [FRESH] I find and see if it's something I'd like to add to the playlist. I do not discard a song because it's a female singer. There are more male bands in the playlist as well as there are more male bands that do not make it into the playlist, purely because there is that male dominance in the industry.

To me, this argument is as ridiculous as someone pointing out that the top 3 are african american artists and we should be listening to more caucasian musicians. It does not make sense at all, listen to the music, their art and not to what the person looks like.

It's not a valid argument to listen to someone just because they are female, it's insulting to them, their hard work and to their art that you only value them because of their sex."
644,2020-03-24 11:27:34,fnhuu7,"I'm glad you're making these points Acer, and doing so in such a calm manner, because this is largely how I feel about this debate as it pertains to this list.

Everything needs to be done to increase gender equity in the music industry which has systematic issues with sexism. However, I resent any notion that I inherently favour one gender's music over another, and female artists make up a considerable chunk of my listening habits (not quite half, but close I reckon). But on average for me there is something qualitatively different about being moved by a male singer, and emotion is often what elevates an album to the top of my lists. I say on average because I absolutely can get wrecked by the emotion of female artists (e.g., Weyes Blood this year), but usually for me it doesn't quite have the impact of someone like Jack Tatum or Avey Tare yearning for the love of a girl, which is just inherently more relatable than vice versa due to me being a man. I hope the women on this sub can respect that."
645,2020-03-23 17:10:02,fnhuu7,"They are quite nice and enjoyable! They're a duo singing, they sing in english though. Their voices complement well one another. I prefer their earlier stuff but the new one is enjoyable too!"
646,2020-03-23 16:09:56,fnhuu7,"Hmm. I'm not judging you at all but if you care I'll explain where I'm coming from. Skip it if not I don't care. Well I grew up listening to punk in the late 80s early 90s and indie vs corporate artists was always a big thing but I think pretty much since Nirvana and the creation of the Billboard genre ""Alternative"" all the lines got blurred. Like I said, it seems like most people just equate indie with alternative now. And people don't care about whether artists are ""corporate"" or not the way they did when I was growing up. It is just different times, I guess. To me it is sad because it is like the corporate music has really become ubiquitous, like hardly anyone is even really thinking about alternatives anymore. 

But there will always be indie musicians out there doing their thing. In basements and in bars. There will always be indie labels to out out the stuff the corporate labels won't because it won't make them enough money. 

That's the true reason why we need independent labels, what I was referring to when I mentioned censorship. The fact is corporate labels exist to make money so they don't take chances. All that's new comes from the indie works first. Only once they've proven they can be successful do corporate labels accept artists. There will always be music to extreme or weird or experimental for the corporate labels to profit off if it so people have to put out those records themselves, *independently.* And that's where the distinction comes in. 

I don't know if any if this makes any sense or if I'm explaining very well but anyway, when I was growing up I can't even tell you how many hours I spent arguing with people about how corporate artists suck because they are just products and how there is just as good of music on indie labels so I don't need to support any corporate music yadda yadda. Nowadays I feel much less rigid about that and I'll acknowledge major label stuff if it's good. But when I was coming up it was different. 

I DJed at a college radio station in 94. We had to be careful to only play indie artists. I guess that's another thing that made the distinction more prominent to me."
647,2020-03-23 16:31:22,fnhuu7,"Again, the meaning of indie or independent music hasn't changed just because you didn't understand it. Yes some people out of ignorance have equated indie music with ""alternative"", but it has always meant music on independent labels. Do you feel dumb because you forgot that because I'm not judging you for it but don't play dumb, indie music still means independent."
648,2020-03-23 16:20:27,fnhuu7,"I did the college radio thing too a couple years ago. Their rule had to do more with artists that get on billboard and stuff rather than the labels that the music was released on. I guess I've always known that the traditional definition of indie was 'independently released', or at least on an independent label. It's just that I rarely hear people I'm around talk about that in regards to indie music so my definition became fuzzier. It's definitely an interesting phenomenon and I have no doubt that it's another thing that came about because of streaming."
649,2020-03-23 16:33:10,fnhuu7,[deleted]
650,2020-03-23 16:27:10,fnhuu7,"Well because of streaming, stuff like soundcloud and even reddit or YouTube a musical artists doesn't really need to be on a record label when they are starting. It is a lot but they could do everything for themselves easier than ever now. And we see acts going from no label at all to Billboard artists now too. But if you think about it before the Internet it was a lot harder for a lone independent artist to get their shit distributed beyond locally, so they practically had to find some label to help them. And if course the corporate labels couldn't take everyone. So there was a huge need for independent record labels. But nowadays I don't know if they are as necessary. With the Internet it is easy for anyone to get their music heard by people all over the world. So independent record labels aren't really as essential. I guess maybe that kind of explains why it is not a thing people care about as much now as they used to."

693,2020-03-05 16:54:10,fdxd1t,I love Janelle Monae!
694,2020-03-06 05:20:34,fdxd1t,I love how mysterious they're being with this movie.
695,2020-03-05 16:10:23,fdxd1t,april’s looking like an exciting month with this and antlers.
696,2020-03-05 16:12:44,fdxd1t,I love the trailers for this movie. I STILL have no clue what it's about but I want to see it.
697,2020-03-06 03:09:18,fdxd1t,"I’m really excited about this one. I have a soft spot for ambiguous storytelling, especially in the horror genre, and from the trailer alone, I feel it’s right up there. Also, I’m loving the fact that more POC are leading in horror movies lately. Probably thanks to Peele’s vision."
698,2020-03-06 05:38:09,fdxd1t,"This looks really intriguing, I hope they keep all the marketing somewhat vague like this."
699,2020-03-05 17:48:11,fdxd1t,"Every time I see a trailer for this it reminds me of The Saga of the Swamp Thing #41. I doubt they'll share anything other than the concept of the ghost of southern oppression rising up, but since the trailer tells me nothing I dunno."
700,2020-03-05 16:17:06,fdxd1t,"Janelle Monáe is one of the worst actresses I've ever seen, but this seems pretty good regardless. She should just stick to music, that seems to be her forte."
701,2020-03-05 16:58:41,fdxd1t,"I love Janelle to death, but why is she only ever in oppression movies or cartoons where you can't actually see her face??? It irks me. I personally think she's popular enough to be in other genres, why isn't she getting tapped for those??"
702,2020-03-05 20:11:26,fdxd1t,"this one intrigues me.  i fully expect it to be disappointing, as i usually am, but it gives me a really different vibe."
703,2020-03-05 17:30:04,fdxd1t,I had to google the writers and directors and they're not known for anything substantial. I won't hold my breath on this one.
704,2020-03-05 18:57:21,fdxd1t,"When I saw the trailer a couple of months back, it made me think that maybe it's based on the book Kindred, by the sci-fi author Octavia Butler.  Cool to see Monae in something where she finally has the lead role---forgot that she was just in the movie Harriet---which she was good in, of course."
705,2020-03-06 05:36:05,fdxd1t,"maybe she's going to back in time to relive/participate in something that happened historically but was scrubbed/rewritten in history books?  that could be an interesting commentary, since sometimes atrocities are forgotten (like the bombing of black wall street)"
706,2020-03-05 16:42:02,fdxd1t,Why do you think she’s bad?
707,2020-03-05 17:14:32,fdxd1t,She was pretty prominent in that NASA movie a couple of years back.
708,2020-03-05 18:07:22,fdxd1t,"The first thing I saw her in was *Moonlight*, which I wouldn't necessarily call an oppression movie."

710,2020-03-05 18:19:58,fdxd1t,"The fact this is a brand new writer/director stepping into a somewhat mainstream horror film is why I AM excited. They could be the new Ari Aster or James Wan. Maybe not. But I love horror, so I'll be checking it out"
711,2020-03-05 18:50:09,fdxd1t,"They're new, and you have to start somewhere. How do you think today's horror directors and writers got big?"
712,2020-03-05 19:06:34,fdxd1t,It totally gave me Kindred vibes too!
713,2020-03-05 22:26:48,fdxd1t,I kind of thought this too!  I love that book.  My 10th grade English class read it and it became one of my favorites.
714,2020-03-05 16:55:05,fdxd1t,"She's incredibly awkward and wooden, like she's just randomly reciting lines instead of acting out a character. Her performances just always take me out of the movie completely and I see her, not her character."
715,2020-03-06 05:12:12,fdxd1t,Prominent enough to not know the name of it
716,2020-03-05 17:18:51,fdxd1t,"Okay but I need more than just one movie lol She's got a few movies under her belt now, she needs to branch out more.

Edit: I just realized you're talking about Hidden Figures, which is *literally* about black women oppressed in the STEM field.....which only serves to prove my point more.

Edit 2: why are yall booin me, I'm right lmfao"
717,2020-03-05 18:19:00,fdxd1t,"What would you call it then? And again, even if you don't count that movie as an oppression movie it is still one movie of the several she has acted in."
718,2020-03-05 19:21:17,fdxd1t,"I'm more pointing at how they're advertising it as being created by the same people who made Get Out and Us.  Kind of a shitty thing to do when your directors and writers are fresh off the boat.

They want to do this not out of altruism, but because it is a smear on their family's legacy.

Now Janelle Monae has to navigate the slave-holding south while trying to save herself and the others around her. On top of that, the two time periods are starting to blur together"

I’m not surprised to see this after Janelle went against the general view of the sub that Bernie is the best candidate for president. 


Additionally this used pretty traditional twitter cancellation tactics. The way it boils down an act into something much more generalized. Janelle tweeting “Elizabeth Warren     .” On Super Tuesday way after it really had a chance of having an impact is now “Janelle helped Biden win the nomination”. I’m tired of it and I’m tired of this sub not letting people like Janelle be complicated and have different views than the subs hive mind does."

Okay and? There’s no guarantee that Bernie will beat Trump either.

> the incomplete results from super tuesday?

Idk what you mean by incomplete. All of the races have been called. The exact number of delegates is TBD but it’s clear that Biden has more delegates than Bernie at this point. Not all of the states are at 100% reporting, but if the race isn’t close, you can call the results long before all the votes are counted. Of course there’s still many more primaries to go, I’m not suggesting that Biden will definitely win the nomination. I’m just talking about the results of last night."

I actually love how in-depth this is. The album might not be a prophetic omen, but it deserves a lot like the attention and effort you gave this post."

Just the thought of it being the middle of summer and being “idle” and having all this “free time” but not getting to go out and do stuff with others (like yea you can go outside obviously but it’s not just that) is pretty depressing and...yeah, gloomy.

924,2020-07-22 20:38:47,hf3la5,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""today's PC madness,"" but I think it's a story that works way better on the page. So so much of the meaning comes from what's in her head, and it's hard to do that on screen without a clunky narration. But if someone figures out a way to do that well, then I'd love to see it adapted."

But when he started going in on people who wear masks in public he lost me. Like... it doesn't hurt you for someone else to wear a mask. In fact, they're doing you a favour. So shut the *fuck* up and stick to what you know."

938,2020-06-22 17:53:31,hdo0mk,"It totally is. For such an unremarkable person, I fail to see what draws people to Rogan, but I have no issues with people having different tastes. But Rogan's head has become overly inflated in recent months because of the cult-like behavior of his fans. He's clearly begun to think of himself as above reproach, and he considers any criticism to be another indication of today's outrage culture.

He's so basic it's laughable."

958,2020-06-16 19:36:42,ha7gs2,"As a member of the GP when it comes to Gaga, I've always had the ""The Fame"" and ""The Fame Monster"" eras in my mind when I see her name, not Born This Way."
959,2020-06-16 17:05:53,ha7gs2,"For Carly it’s probably E•MO•TION. Even if she releases a better album in regards to quality, which I think is very possible, I don’t think she will ever be able to recreate the word of mouth effort that brought that album into so many people’s lives. There’s something that makes an album seem so much more personal when it comes into your life that way."
960,2020-06-16 17:53:32,ha7gs2,"I feel that Dua Lipa's magnus opus is yet to come. She has proved that she can make great albums and she's just starting. I think that if she plays her cards right, she can make her next albums even more iconic.

I think Lana's a special case. Ask any fan and they will answer that her magnus opus is either Born To Die, Norman Fucking Rockwell! or Ultraviolence (and some, like me, would say it's Honeymoon). I think she may have another Magnus Opus under her sleeve: all her albums are sonically different and she has evolved her writing a lot.

You didn't mention her, but I wonder which album would be considered the Magnus Opus of Kylie Minogue. I have seen arguments in favor of Fever, X and Impossible Princess, so it would be hard to choose. I would go for Impossible Princess, for I think it is a flawless album, but I'd like to hear other arguments."
961,2020-06-16 20:15:41,ha7gs2,Thoughts on Janet? Velvet Rope? Rhythm Nation? Control? All three?
962,2020-06-16 17:09:21,ha7gs2,"This might be an unpopular opinion but I think self titled is better than Lemonade. Now don’t get me wrong, I consider Lemonade to be inexpensive therapy when I listen start to end, but I think ‘Beyoncé’ has better songs, better videos, and was just a huge cultural moment that Lemonade didn’t quite top (although she had hers!)."
963,2020-06-16 19:31:00,ha7gs2,"i know he isn't a pop girl but the weeknd i still think has his magnum opus in him. i know a lot of people will say house of balloons or the trilogy as a whole, but i think he can top them. after hours was great but i feel like if he really produced a focused concept with strong songs it would be an incredible piece of work received well by just about everyone. the gp like him, he has a bunch of indie fans from his early days & a strong core fanbase in general, and his stuff is usually well-received by critics."
964,2020-06-16 22:21:18,ha7gs2,I'd say Rihanna's would either be Good Girl Gone Bad or ANTi. They're both career defining albums.
965,2020-06-16 16:45:56,ha7gs2,"For Mariah, it’s probably Butterfly. She herself has even called it her magnum opus haha

For Britney, I go back and forth between In The Zone and Blackout.

For Christina, it’s kinda tied between Stripped and Back to Basics for me. Stripped is one of my favorite albums of all time but she was so in her element with BTB. When I listen to it I can just tell how inspired she was to make a true throwback album honoring her favorite artists. Her vocals sound so good with that style of music too."
966,2020-06-16 16:42:46,ha7gs2,Taylor’s is definatly 1989 not red
967,2020-06-16 20:34:36,ha7gs2,"Definitely think Mariah's is Butterfly, the whole album is just *chef's kiss* in my opinion. I mean Daydream was more commercially successful and I think it was more of a cultural peak for her in terms of the general public knowing the songs (e.g. Fantasy and Always Be My Baby) and for her ruling the charts, but Butterfly was definitely still successful and the whole album just feels amazingly written and very personal. Probably because of her newfound independence. Mariah has so many successful and great albums so there's definitely no single answer."
968,2020-06-16 18:24:24,ha7gs2,"This topic is obviously subjective with the exception of Selena Gomez’s Revival being factual information. And though I do agree with some of the OP, I’m not sure why we’re assuming Dua can’t top her second album yet Ariana is going to be on album 6 and doesn’t have one? That don’t make no cents luv"
969,2020-06-16 17:46:28,ha7gs2,"I think it's safe to say that *Impossible Princess* is Kylie's magnus opus, despite being such a stylistic outlier in her discography. *Aphrodite* is great as well, though, and it feels more representative of her discography as a whole.

The Janet fanbase would probably say *The Velvet Rope* is her magnum opus. However, *Rhythm Nation* is more tightly-structured, and *janet* was her most impactful."
970,2020-06-17 00:21:57,ha7gs2,"For Gwen Stefani it’s definitely Love. Angel. Music. Baby.. Diehard fans like myself probably enjoy The Sweet Escape (2006) or This Is What the Truth Feels Like (2016) a little bit more but LAMB was hit (“Rich Girl”) after hit (“Hollaback Girl”) after hit (“Cool”) and all six singles charted within the top 50 in the US. Remember, this is the 2000s we’re talking about. I am happy, however, that she got her first top 40 single this year with “Nobody but You”"
971,2020-06-16 19:16:33,ha7gs2,EMOTİON
972,2020-06-16 19:01:55,ha7gs2,Demi’s is definitely “Here We Go Again” or “Tell Me You Love Me” you can tell when she’s comfortable with the sound she’s making.
973,2020-06-16 20:47:49,ha7gs2,[deleted]
974,2020-06-16 20:11:06,ha7gs2,"Madonna’s is so hard to be honest, she’s always been quite critically undervalued until Ray Of Light came out, so it’s easy to point to that album and say “that one” since it was when she finally broke through the pop-girl stigma and delivered something the ‘critics’ finally deemed worthy of true appreciation *(Grammys avoided her like the plague prior which is why to this day I don’t take them seriously at all)*, but honestly an argument can def be made for True Blue, Like A Prayer and even Erotica prior to Ray Of Light or Confessions, depends on the argument and criteria"
975,2020-06-17 00:49:33,ha7gs2,"What is the criteria? You say magnum opus then half way turn into “most memorable” or whatever. 

NFR is Lana’s magnum opus, BTD is her most famous. Breakaway by Kelly is her most famous, meaning of life is her magnum opus. I’d say B2B or Bionic are Christina’s best, but Stripped is her most famous."
976,2020-06-16 16:58:09,ha7gs2,Sweetener is Ariana’s magnum opus. Don’t hate me because I’m right.

Breakaway's her most successful album by far and had 4 top 10 hits, but when it comes to artistic vision, My December is beautifully crafted and is probably better written, just not mainstream."
982,2020-06-17 20:07:57,ha7gs2,stupid question but is there a difference between the terms “magnum opus” and “imperial era” or are they essentially the same thing? im assuming the latter but idk
983,2020-06-16 17:28:37,ha7gs2,"I really think Chromatica is Gaga’s magnum opus. It’s a fully realized project that would consider a borderline concept album about using the dance floor as therapy. Not a single skip on this one for me.

Taylor: 1989

Ariana: Dangerous Woman or Thank U Next...depending on your mood

Katy: Teenage Dream

Beyoncé: Lemonade or Beyoncé 

Madonna: Ray Of Light or Confessions On A Dancefloor 

Lorde: Melodrama"

It has Can't Get you Outta My Head (her biggest hit in the US since the 80s) and tracks like Love at First Sight and Come into my world were big in Australia (and probably the UK, but can't confirm as i don't live there)."
995,2020-06-16 20:03:16,ha7gs2,"I think Fever would be the magnum opus, but Impossible Princess is her best album artistically. Light Years is an important album as well but I think it pales in comparison to Fever. Fever is Pop Precision™️"

1004,2020-06-16 17:12:05,ha7gs2,Good points. I was in high school when “Beyonce” dropped and it really was huge. It was like a bomb went off. Everyone was losing their minds that it just randomly dropped. It was talked about for weeks. I couldn’t go into a classroom without hearing people talking about it.
1005,2020-06-16 17:17:17,ha7gs2,"I agree, I honestly go back and forth with self titled and Lemonade but self titled was a true moment. I’ll never forget that surprise drop of not only an album, but music videos too."
1006,2020-06-17 00:45:32,ha7gs2,"Lemonade is a better album. It has more distinct (and important) themes, it’s more consistent, and every single track is vital to the project as a whole. 

Self-Titled feels like less of an album and more of an experiment. I love it to death, but I think that Lemonade reflects a lot of personal and artistic growth that she made from her self-titled days. Lemonade is just tighter and more *perfect* than Self-Titled. 

Those imperfections were kind of the point of Self-Titled, though. Lemonade is better by all accounts, but Self-Titled might be my favorite."
1007,2020-06-16 17:43:06,ha7gs2,The *Lemonade* visual album is superior but as an album/era *Beyoncé* is stronger.
1008,2020-06-17 01:45:59,ha7gs2,Lemonade is shorter and has less filler (though even the “filler” on Beyoncé is pretty good) and it has a story to tell. i agree with the opinion that it’s her magnum opus.

As for Christina, shes one of my all time favorites. The only album I don’t really care for is her debut, which she didn’t have any control over so that’s not a shock. Lotus is fun and has some good songs but is missing something. Stripped, Back to Basics, Bionic, Liberation, and even Burlesque are all god tier."

1017,2020-06-16 18:58:05,ha7gs2,Red is considerably better than 1899
1018,2020-06-16 20:56:46,ha7gs2,"Honestly as much as I love 1989 and Red, I think that Speak Now is gonna be the Swift album that both holds up the best. Those two are where she fully gave into chasing pop music and trends of the time, whereas Speak Now has a very timeless sound. Not that every song on the album is good or has aged well (Innocent and Better than Revenge are very yikes, and Dear John is just long and not very interesting) but the best songs on this album have a very magical quality to them.

of course, I'm a weirdo whose favorite Swift song is Enchanted so maybe that's my bias."

Maybe it's the stan in me, but I feel like the closest we ever got to that in a while has been the ASIB era with Gaga. Pretty much everyone I know, my age, younger, or significantly older, loved the soundtrack and it came up it conversation pretty regularly."

Her fans might hate Joanne, but that was such an iconic and huge era for her. The super bowl, AHS, Coachella, signing her Vegas residency, the start of the A Star is Born hype... it was iconic. Plus the album was such a huge change and in my opinion has the best writing... I just don’t see Chromatica doing what these did, especially with Covid."

Get You Outta My Head was popular even here, in Latin America. I think she also had some other hits in U.K. and Australia (it is the US who paid her dust), but she really had her imperial era with Fever, eh?"
1047,2020-06-16 20:12:43,ha7gs2,"Most people seems to think that Light Years was the pre-evolution of Fever.

Maybe Fever was, indeed, her Magnus Opus. Didn't it spark a craze of Euro-Dance? It also was her ""Ray of Light+"", as it not only revitalized her career, but made her reach a new global peak."
1048,2020-09-01 20:54:07,ha7gs2,You'd think so but a friend of mine who is a metal head didn't even know who Kylie Minogue was! I was 😱. She was everywhere with Can't Get You Out Of My Head but she had never heard of this song or her. I couldn't believe it.

Take that back. 19-year-old Taylor didn't write the most scathing lyrics of her career like *""you'll add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understand""* to be disrespected like this

Edit: the entire bridge is a masterpiece and an explosion of emotion that makes up for the slowness of the other verses. 

**""You are an expert at sorry
/ And keeping the lines blurry
/ Never impressed by me acing your tests
/ All the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes
/ 'Cause you burned them out
/ But I took your matches

/ So don't look now
/ I'm shining like fireworks

1062,2020-06-17 16:36:05,ha7gs2,"I completely agree that Speak Now is her best album but am shocked that some people don't like Dear John! Every lyric is so good. And I suppose if Taylor wrote Innocent NOW it would be a little cringe but back then I thought it was a very poignant and mature song and career move- the lyrics are actually quite good for her having been so young (which you can say for almost every song on the album). I still even like Better than Revenge for nostalgia's sake. I think the only song I can't listen to now is Speak Now, ironically enough, because it's so juvenile. Overall still the strongest album in her discography IMO. I'm amazed at how well some of the songs have held up."

BTW was that bitch before Chromatica came out and I’ll always love that album, but I think it’s a tad too long and doesn’t really have a cool centralized theme as Chromatica. Miss Rona can go fuck off, Chromatica is too powerful and is already breaking records: Gaga is in the top 10 on Spotify for the first time in hear career."

 Songs like Pretty Hurts, Flawless and the Ghost part of Haunted  which deal with her being unsatisfied with her career, feeling pressured and the misogyny she dealt with etc deserve to be explored in an album on itself."
1083,2020-06-17 17:04:10,ha7gs2,"I actually really like Speak Now (the song), it's one of those songs I've always been able to visualize really clearly, just picturing dorky SN-era Taylor doing Solid Snake moves around a church wedding while avoiding a bridezilla and trying to get close to the groom, it's all very funny and cute."

1090,2020-06-17 01:14:38,ha7gs2,"It seems so. But I admit that before getting deep into her discography I only knew Can't Get You Out Of My Head.

Thematically, a Homogenic vs Ray of Light vs Impossible Princess ""Ethereal Alt-Pop Greatness Rate"" would be absolutely perfect, due to how close they were released, and how their vibes feel similar. Sadly, I think that either Homogenic or Ray of Light has already been rated.

Appart from those? I don't really know. Maybe ""Australian Indie Pop Rate"" with IP, perhaps Tame Impala's Lonerism/Currents and... I'm drawing a blank. Maybe a pre-fame Sia's album. There also the (maybe terrible) possibility of a ""Tragically Timed Albums Rate"", so it can be rated with Mariah's Glitter (some say that Impossible Princess flopped in U.K. because of its original name, and the fact that it was released around the time that Princess Diana died). But I can't picture a third album for the rate."
1091,2020-06-17 01:00:46,ha7gs2,">I think ~~having it only streamed on~~ tidal was a big mistake honestly.

Fixed that for you"
1092,2020-06-17 18:51:12,ha7gs2,"Yeah, went back to the album and Pretty Hurts is actually quite boring."
1093,2020-06-18 14:18:11,ha7gs2,That song could’ve had such a good and successful video
1094,2020-06-17 01:51:51,ha7gs2,or 1989
1095,2020-06-17 00:50:19,ha7gs2,Music comes from white boys from Canada with teams of song writers? This is news to me.
1096,2020-06-16 20:03:46,ha7gs2,Just because she didn’t produce them doesn’t mean she didn’t have a part to play in the composition of the tracks. Many of these pop songs are written on an instrument and then transposed to a more danceable beat if you will.
1097,2020-06-17 06:09:32,ha7gs2,Why is using teams of songwriters inherently a bad thing? Plus a ton of pop girls use teams of songwriters too. I think Shawn is bland as fuck but that's not really a fair criticism
1098,2020-06-16 20:08:45,ha7gs2,if the barebones composition was hers than she’d have credits for it
1099,2020-06-17 07:04:42,ha7gs2,"IMO it’s a combo of using teams to create the music equivalent of unflavored yogurt, not necessarily the teams themselves. Beyoncé has teams of writers and consistently pushes boundaries."

1102,2020-06-15 15:58:24,h9ihal,Giving Todrick the Juneteenth spot and shunting Janelle to the end of the month was... an interesting choice. Maybe she's busy that day.

1108,2020-06-15 20:37:16,h9ihal,honestly though... is it because he's taylor's friend? what is the reason?

There are little to no fem gay entertainers for the type of queerness the media likes to represent. Maybe Troye Sivan or Adam Lambert, but Adam hasn't been in the spotlight for almost a decade now, and Troye has little to no media presence when he isn't doing an album cycle."

> Janelle Monáe (born Janelle Monáe Robinson on December 1, 1985 in Kansas City, Kansas) is an American singer, songwriter, dancer, producer, actor and performer.

>  She moved to New York to study theatre at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy. Her original plan was to pursue a career on Broadway, but she soon changed her mind and returned to music. After moving to Atlanta, Georgia in 2003,  Monáe founded the Wondaland Arts Society with like-minded young artists, and made a couple of appearances on OutKast's 2006 album Idlewild, where she is featured on the songs ""Call the Law"" and ""In Your Dreams"".

> By 2007, Monáe was ready to release her first solo work, titled Metropolis. It was originally conceived as a concept album in four parts, or suites, which were to be released through her website and mp3 download sites. After the release of the first part of the series, Metropolis Suite I of IV: The Chase in mid-2007, these plans were altered following her signing with Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' label, Bad Boy Records, later in the year. The label gave an official and physical release to the first suite in August 2008, which was retitled Metropolis: The Chase Suite (Special Edition) and included two new tracks. The EP was generally well-received by critics, gaining Monáe a 2009 Grammy nomination in the Best Urban/Alternative Performance for her single ""Many Moons"", festival appearances, and opening slots for the indie pop band Of Montreal. Monáe also toured as the opening act for band No Doubt on their summer 2009 tour.

>  In a November 2009 interview, Monáe revealed the title and concept behind her album The ArchAndroid. The second and third suites of Metropolis are combined into this full-length release, in which Monáe's alter-ego, Cindi Mayweather - also the protagonist of Metropolis: The Chase Suite - becomes a messiah-like figure to the android community of Metropolis.

Some of my fav moments that really resonated with me:

""Sometimes, I'd feel restless, watching my friends go on far ahead of me. And attempting to keep up with their speed would only leave me breathless. I soon realized that their pace was not my own."" - Jin

""Take your hands off of what you can’t control and get your hands on what you can control. The only thing you can control is yourself."" - SUGA

""There will be times in your life that you question your own decisions, whether it be about your major or your profession."" - J-hope 

“You are the leader of your own life.” - J-hope"

1160,2020-06-07 23:36:30,gxm38h,I .....cannot believe they performed Spring Day omg. My heart rate rose SO fast when I heard it. I teared up within five seconds no joke. Spring Day has such a special place in my heart (and for so many of us) and it felt so fitting to include for this event. It brings so much raw emotion and warmth and... inspiration too. Motivation. Idk. It makes me sad but it makes me happy and I’m so so so so glad I got to hear them perform it again after all these years. THANK YOU BANGTANNN

1170,2020-06-07 23:36:20,gxm38h,might be wrong but I feel like that was the biggest scale “performance” they’ve done since covid and I really felt it.

1201,2020-06-07 20:41:15,gxm38h,BTS reminding me yet again why I consider them my safe space 🥺💜
1202,2020-06-07 20:44:54,gxm38h,"The fact that the google ceo chose to highlight the obamas, beyonce, lady gaga, and BTS... they’ve really made it 🥺"
1203,2020-06-07 21:05:11,gxm38h,What Sal Khan does on Khan Academy is literally invaluable. Got me through my entrance tests when I went back to college later in life. Dude's awesome.
1204,2020-06-07 21:26:18,gxm38h,Just a quick update guys. Our donation fund for #MatchAMillion is at 800k 😭😭😭
1205,2020-06-07 21:29:15,gxm38h,Zach calling us out because we're just waiting for BTS..... he knows us too well
1206,2020-06-07 21:41:46,gxm38h,Having Martha Stewart and Snoop Dogg back to back really cracks me up
1207,2020-06-07 22:46:35,gxm38h,Now that's a president!

SPRING DAY

1210,2020-06-07 23:41:29,gxm38h,"There is this part in Spring day, when Jin sings and abruptly smiles, it does things to my heart. I cannot explain it

Spring day and Microcosmos was lovely. Just a beautiful way to end the show. If lyrics were added it would have been 5X lovelier"
1211,2020-06-07 23:48:07,gxm38h,"it was my first time in a long time being this active and commenting lots online. it's been real fun watching this with the others army and reading your reactions, even though I did not reply that much t.t (I'm shy x.x)

honestly, I came watching this streaming thinking it will be another long, boring and awkward show waiting for bts. however I found myself enjoying this a lot, got inspired by speeches & cried lots haha

the boys were motivating and touching through their speeches. I also needed a slap of reality from yoongs.
as well as the mini-concert omg! they were stunning in those suits, they sounded wonderful and my heart jumped in joy with all the adorableness!! (and just for seeing them perform)☺ 


and spring day my god!!!!!!"
1212,2020-06-07 20:36:26,gxm38h,"Their speeches reflected their individual personalities and voices, all of them so lovely. I started tearing up when Jimin was speaking. It has been a long while since I graduated from anything, but their words are comforting no matter what phase you are at in life - uncertainty and the inevitability of change never stop.

They did well, my heart is purple. 💜"
1213,2020-06-07 23:55:29,gxm38h,I must add.. Kim Taehyung really is something isn’t he. Gosh.
1214,2020-06-07 19:36:34,gxm38h,"Dang, I was expecting YouTube to kinda rush some of these speeches. But if Beyonce's is this long, strong and powerful, imagine Michelle Obama's and BTS's."
1215,2020-06-07 19:36:43,gxm38h,I want Beyoncé’s speech framed on my wall.🥺
1216,2020-06-07 20:24:40,gxm38h,"Yoongi please, it just keeps getting better. It's times like this where you think ""yeah, I see why they're all great songwriters."""
1217,2020-06-07 20:30:56,gxm38h,I know I love these guys already but I'd have fallen in love right now anyway if not
1218,2020-06-07 20:32:19,gxm38h,I compulsively stood up and threw a pillow LMAOOOO they’re the only people who always make me “audience participate” alone in my living room
1219,2020-06-07 20:33:18,gxm38h,Jimin's speech was so sweet! Also I love Jin so much.
1220,2020-06-07 20:39:04,gxm38h,I thought all their speeches were wonderful but Jin’s speech really resonated with me especially as someone who is afraid of not graduating within 4 years. His words were really reassuring and I just have to go at my own pace :)
1221,2020-06-07 23:32:16,gxm38h,I would like to invite you all to my funeral

1224,2020-06-07 19:21:54,gxm38h,Okay y’all win already. I would’ve rather had this than sit through my high school and college graduations lol
1225,2020-06-07 19:51:24,gxm38h,Honestly just the fact that Michelle Obama exists is comforting...what an amazing woman

1230,2020-06-07 20:33:03,gxm38h,"Tearing up a bit - think I needed to hear some of those words more than I realized, especially Jin's. I'm not even a grad but I'm kind of in a weird phase of life right now where all of these speeches could apply LOL"
1231,2020-06-07 22:45:50,gxm38h,BARACK OBAMA. that's it.
1232,2020-06-07 23:14:46,gxm38h,I want to see Bts tweerking with Megan
1233,2020-06-07 23:30:11,gxm38h,WHY DID THEY CHOOSE ALL THE SONGS THAT MAKE ME CRY HELP
1234,2020-06-08 00:07:59,gxm38h,GUYS REMEMBER JOON SAID HE LISTENS TO SPRING DAY A LOT LATELY AND THEN CRIES BECAUSE HE MISSES US!!! MAYBE THATS WHY THEY CHOSE IT :(

WHO IS CUTTING ONIONS!!!!!!!"
1236,2020-06-07 19:22:32,gxm38h,"Face masks, kneeling, and fists in the air are probably gonna be some of the biggest emblems of 2020. This year's class truly had a crazy amount of obstacles and circumstances thrown at them."
1237,2020-06-07 19:22:47,gxm38h,Can Michelle Obama run for president? That would be so powerful
1238,2020-06-07 19:59:48,gxm38h,"This is a very powerful speech. As expected from Michelle Obama, and I hope graduates watching this are absorbing it."
1239,2020-06-07 20:09:13,gxm38h,No matter what your opinion is of the Obamas you cannot deny that Michelle is an amazing speaker.
1240,2020-06-07 20:10:15,gxm38h,“Did the president really tell people to drink bleach?” 😭
1241,2020-06-07 20:31:02,gxm38h,lmao joon
1242,2020-06-07 20:31:44,gxm38h,And then they ended it in the most BTS way possible hahaha I love these boys
1243,2020-06-07 20:38:48,gxm38h,"Jin speech touch me the most I think..I need to rewatch but I’m going to cry, so maybe later 💜"
1244,2020-06-07 20:47:12,gxm38h,"I'm glad they all got to speak. 😊 I love that they brought both comfort and encouragement in their speeches, and that they talked about personal experiences. Would have to watch again but a few things that have resonated with me so far was Jin realizing that he must go on his own pace and Yoongi talking about the things we can and cannot change and to do something about those that we can. 💜 Yoongi's in particular had many ""quotable quotes"" lol

Namjoon's loud cry of pain when Kookie's graduation cap hit him 😂 I can't believe they didn't retake that part or edit it 😂 But it's all cute though.. It's so them 😂

Congratulations, Class of 2020!!! 🎉👏💜💜💜

Edit: so Yoongi's words were actually ""control"" and not ""change"" but I guess it's almost the same in this context 😅"
1245,2020-06-07 22:52:54,gxm38h,Just sitting here in my ‘BERNIE 2016’ sweatshirt and crying
1246,2020-06-07 22:54:53,gxm38h,“It gives us the ability to select our own realities” WOW yes this is good

1248,2020-06-07 23:32:48,gxm38h,"Oh my Jesus. Kim Taehyung. And their song choices so far. I’ve been destroyed.

EDIT: I need to rewatch this ASAP."
1249,2020-06-07 17:08:28,gxm38h,"for those wanting to catch just bts, their blocks are at **4pm et** and **7pm et**

edit : 😳 it's [stated](https://variety.com/2020/film/news/how-to-watch-youtube-graduation-obama-bts-beyonce-lady-gaga-1234626544-1234626544/amp/) that michelle obama is in the 4pm block and barack obama goes on at the 7pm block. which makes bts' second appearance at 8pm.

edit 2 : unless they mean barack obama is lower on the list and so he'll be speaking somewhere around 7pm. which makes bts' appearance 7.30+ ish."

1252,2020-06-07 19:27:53,gxm38h,This is beautiful. Grateful to Bangtan for giving me a chance to witness the most wholesome thing I've seen in a while
1253,2020-06-07 19:34:02,gxm38h,I need a transcript of this. Beyonce is dropping gems
1254,2020-06-07 19:44:00,gxm38h,"Can we get this kind of event every year? Like yeah, maybe people will graduate next year as they normally do, but there are still people who do not get to fully experience moments like this due to personal issues or things like that."
1255,2020-06-07 20:01:37,gxm38h,Michelle Obama's speech is making me so emotional. What an amazing woman! I love you Michelle!!!
1256,2020-06-07 20:21:15,gxm38h,"Namjoon you are my King 

I love the Korean and English subs

They'll each give a speech? 😭

Edit: Jin said take it one step at a time. It's a simple message but very, very important."
1257,2020-06-07 20:21:26,gxm38h,OMG OMG THANK YOU. thank you for letting them speak in Korean
1258,2020-06-07 20:23:20,gxm38h,JIN KEEPING IT REAL. Everyone has their own pace!!

1263,2020-06-07 20:46:04,gxm38h,I feel sooooo bad I know I should be paying attention to all these speakers but my mind is still thinking about Jimin
1264,2020-06-07 20:53:40,gxm38h,"I think one of the most amazing things about Dear Class of 2020 is that while we're mostly here for BTS, we get to learn about who some of the other speakers are."
1265,2020-06-07 20:58:48,gxm38h,"Jin's speech hit me the most. We need to realise we need to go at our pace and that's ok. 

Also Namjoon did so well. He spoke so well. English King and his way with words.. just perfect. 

I lost it at the end when the cap hit Namjoon in the face and then he started jumping 😂"
1266,2020-06-07 23:10:21,gxm38h,Ok Meg has multiple songs fingers crossed for the boys too!

1268,2020-06-07 23:39:48,gxm38h,"The surge of emotions when Spring Day started playing and the absolute comfort hearing that song again... I'm still not over it. 

And the joy on their faces as they performed. Mikrokosmos was so light and happy. They really love what they do."
1269,2020-06-07 23:40:20,gxm38h,"You guys I can't wait until next weekend to share the BANGBANGCONLIVE LOVE with all of you! I feel like this performance was so much for ARMY as it was for the graduates. Like they picked all songs that would display how much they love and miss us. And Queen Spring Day coming back? I mean, that's just purely for ARMY."
1270,2020-06-07 23:42:39,gxm38h,"On a lighter note

The contrast between Jimin and Taehyung’s choice of footwear. Hehe never change"
1271,2020-06-07 23:43:08,gxm38h,"The moment I clicked the livestream, they were singing Spring Day and that caught me off guard so much I instantly cried. I was sobbing. It brought me back to the first BTS concert I went to in 2017 as a baby ARMY and it was also during my last semester as a senior in college. Spring Day has such a special place in my heart. I can’t I’m crying again 😂😭"
1272,2020-06-07 23:46:26,gxm38h,Ah as soon as I heard Spring Day I teared up uuugghhhh that was so nice I’m happy with their song choices and it was great seeing them be happy
1273,2020-06-07 23:51:13,gxm38h,JUNGKOOK LOOKED ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS OMG
1274,2020-06-07 23:58:42,gxm38h,Were they *trying* to make us cry by choosing Spring Day and Mikrokosmos????
1275,2020-06-07 23:58:59,gxm38h,"Ok I watched the performance again and I‘m loving VMin creating chaos and clowning everyone. Performing when there is no one physically present to watch other than staff? That can’t be easy. Bless VMin for trying to put smiles on everyone’s faces and make it fun.

Also I look forward to seeing new army on this sub that will say “I discovered them because of that YouTube 2020 graduation special” :)"

Wonderful words. So proud."
1287,2020-06-07 20:46:55,gxm38h,"Beautifully done. Their speeches were very individually them and from heart.  Beyoncé and Michelle Obama as well. Powerful words.

Honestly, I’d take this kind of graduation a bazillion times over rather than having to sit on metal bleachers in the hot sun."
1288,2020-06-07 22:15:55,gxm38h,"As someone who doesn't wear makeup, this is 'draw the rest of the owl' material :P"

1292,2020-06-07 23:34:48,gxm38h,"You can see how happy they are to get to perform, even if it's not live. I love them singing along to all the parts.

Get someone that looks at you the way everyone looks at Jin singing Spring Day."

Can I say Jimin looks so good in stripes??? And JK’s Mikrokosmos polo is so pretty!!!

Tae’s perm js now my ult fave style. PERIOD."

1301,2020-06-07 19:48:43,gxm38h,"I graduated years ago (lol) but the emotions I have now watching this are still the same when I sat there listening to guest speakers telling us to follow our dreams, to accept that we will fail, to embrace the losses as much as the successes, to be brave and bold and take risks...

But the speeches here are so much more powerful, more inclusive, more reality-based than the usual ""you'll make it, don't worry!"" These words are what everyone needs to hear and absorb right now.

I'm listening to Michelle Obama speak now and it's hitting really different. I don't know how I'll be by the time BTS speak.

EDIT: 

""Treating people right will never ever fail you.""
- Michelle Obama."
1302,2020-06-07 19:56:28,gxm38h,"Gosh, between Beyoncé’s and Michelle Obama’s speeches (especially pretty much being back to back), it’s already been a very touching stream. 

I felt so much listening to them. They really know how to deliver speeches and hit home."
1303,2020-06-07 19:57:33,gxm38h,Michelle Obama talking about anger reminds me of Bang PD feeling angry about the music industry. He's definitely striving to become a better label.
1304,2020-06-07 20:01:47,gxm38h,Michelle out here telling us to finish what our ancestors started. She trusts and believes in us so much wow

Tech we've had but never used to this degree. Unique times, these are."

1323,2020-06-08 02:44:51,gxm38h,"VMin radiating soulmate energy during Mikrokosmos. It's cute how they switched mics at the end.

Hey Taejin, STOB IT. My heart can't handle their cuteness.

Yoongi copying Tae's moves but he danced it in tiny. lol"
1324,2020-06-07 20:26:30,gxm38h,"Jimin has such a warm way of speaking, like he's giving you a hug with his words 🥺"
1325,2020-06-07 19:13:49,gxm38h,"It’s only been 13 minutes, I’m not even graduating but I’m tearing up"
1326,2020-06-07 19:20:00,gxm38h,Like a regular grad ceremony this graduation thing is also gonna last about 5 hours. As Mrs. Obama said at least it doesn't require everyone to be in the heat.
1327,2020-06-07 19:27:57,gxm38h,Loving this display of black female excellence 🖤
1328,2020-06-07 19:31:06,gxm38h,YES SPEAK ON IT BEY 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽

1330,2020-06-07 19:38:35,gxm38h,Guys I'm about to move across the globe by myself and I'm so excited but so terrified...the end of that speech really hit different
1331,2020-06-07 19:43:30,gxm38h,Chris Martin 🥺🥺🥺 his voice brings me so many happy memories
1332,2020-06-07 19:48:53,gxm38h,Michelle really just summing up what everyone's been feeling

1336,2020-06-07 20:13:48,gxm38h,Lmao BTS has added to my sleep deficit in these past four years 😂
1337,2020-06-07 20:20:02,gxm38h,Preaching to the choir but Joon’s English delivery is AMAZING
1338,2020-06-07 20:21:38,gxm38h,"Omg this is way more personal than I thought it would be, I’m so glad the world gets to see this!"
1339,2020-06-07 20:23:20,gxm38h,Jin and his dance practices! 😭
1340,2020-06-07 20:24:40,gxm38h,“ The only thing we can control is ourselves”
1341,2020-06-07 20:25:24,gxm38h,Aww jiminie asking about our health ❤️❤️
1342,2020-06-07 20:25:52,gxm38h,That ending was so typical Yoongi loool
1343,2020-06-07 20:29:59,gxm38h,Taehyung please my heart cant handle it
1344,2020-06-07 20:41:59,gxm38h,Jimin almost made me cry into my bowl of Cheetos :(
1345,2020-06-07 20:44:09,gxm38h,"I am rewatching the bangtantv one now

Namjoon really pointed at Hobi for hope awwwwwwww"
1346,2020-06-07 20:47:53,gxm38h,"Sundar pichai mentioning BTS I'm proud as a fellow Indian LOLOL (don't ask me, that's what you're proud about?)"
1347,2020-06-07 20:49:01,gxm38h,"Everytime they say BTS or they put it on the screen... man, that's a lot.
I am glad everybody is accepting a great part of this generation is shaped by artists and people like BTS.
I know I do and I am glad my students will take away great things from their message, the same things I am trying to instill in them- self love, hard work, compassion, emphaty. Because I do believe these are going to bring the change we are all awaiting."
1348,2020-06-07 20:55:31,gxm38h,Jin's speech really stuck with me. And Jimin's is like a warm blanket.
1349,2020-06-07 21:00:36,gxm38h,"I might be showing my age, but ugh I always had a crush on JGL when I was younger."
1350,2020-06-07 23:02:50,gxm38h,"I'm still thinking about Seokjin's words after all this time: 

>If any of you feels lost in the face of doubt or uncertainty, or the pressure of starting anew, don’t rush. Take a deep breath. You may find that any moment can be turned into an opportunity. Allow yourself to take it easy. Take it one step at a time. You might discover the important things you were missing, and they will reach out to you. 

I'm just wrapping up two weeks of furlough and I'm going back to my full-time job for three weeks before they terminate my contract. My husband and I have saved up enough money to last us about four months, which is amazing. But I fear it's going to be a while before the market opens back up for my work (I'm a technical writer)  in my state. So I'm just worried. But I'm trying to find moments of grace for myself."
1351,2020-06-07 23:05:32,gxm38h,The commencement ceremony wouldn't be complete without Firework lmao. Back in my day we had that [Vitamin C song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foyAOoVagWw)
1352,2020-06-07 23:13:16,gxm38h,"Those splits, I'm speechless. On another note, this gives me a lot of hope for how long BTS' block will be!"
1353,2020-06-07 23:14:27,gxm38h,What if the boys do a medley performance of their songs!?! 😱 and not JUST bwl....🤞🏽
1354,2020-06-07 23:14:39,gxm38h,Lmao SAVAGE reminds me of all of the twitter  edits of Jimin being a bad bitch 😂🙌🏼
1355,2020-06-07 23:25:40,gxm38h,GOOD The locals deserve to hear this. I only wish there were lyric subtitles too so they could get the full extent of it
1356,2020-06-07 23:31:49,gxm38h,Jin doing his little dance in the background I'm cryinnnnnnnn
1357,2020-06-07 23:32:53,gxm38h,VIMIN FOR THE WIN
1358,2020-06-07 23:33:29,gxm38h,that was it......... it was so short :(
1359,2020-06-07 23:34:02,gxm38h,Did anybody correctly predict that set list? I feel like they just ambushed us.
1360,2020-06-07 23:34:33,gxm38h,Spring Day and Mikrokosmos really gave off that post hat throw moment where you’re looking for all your friends and family in the crowd and crying. 😭😭😭😭
1361,2020-06-07 23:45:05,gxm38h,I literally screamed oh my god when spring day came on and my parents thought something bad happened lmao
1362,2020-06-07 21:00:50,gxm38h,"Much appreciated the speed with which this was put up on Bangtan tv and I’m really happy to see that everyone got to talk. Each boy has a different story to tell and relates in different way to fans, so it was fantastic they got to speak and do so in their language, so as to fully be able to express themselves.

Namjoon, Seokjin, Yoongi, Hoseok, Jimin, Taehyung & Jungkook, thank you for being a beacon of good in the dark world 💜


Class of 2020, times are tough and all may look bleak but you have the strength in you to realise your dreams and to be the change you want to see in this world 💜


@mods I don’t think we should remove the Bangtantv thread. That video is superstar enough to warrant its own post and it lets people better discuss and express themselves."
1363,2020-06-07 21:01:37,gxm38h,"All their speeches were lovely, but Seokjin really touched my heart ♥"
1364,2020-06-07 22:56:51,gxm38h,THIS👏IS👏WHAT👏A👏 PRESIDENT 👏SHOULD👏SAY.

1368,2020-06-07 19:10:12,gxm38h,They have Korean subtitles 😭

No, entire world, vote! Vote the ones who will bring real change and will be guided by real values! And if they stray from them, hold them accountable! No, let's hold them accountable together!"
1383,2020-06-07 19:58:51,gxm38h,The election is closer now to us then the beginning of the year. It’s definitely time to check voter registration and if you can mail in a ballot. Don’t forget change of address changes your ballot.

1396,2020-06-07 20:33:10,gxm38h,"I’m going to have to watch that again!

I was pleasantly surprised that they each told a little anecdote; that was really personal & touching

(Goes without saying, but they look amazing, too)"
1397,2020-06-07 20:34:03,gxm38h,"So nice to see them, I’ve missed them. I know we’re drowning in FESTA content right now, but just to see them speaking sincerely like that has done something to my heart 💜"
1398,2020-06-07 20:35:34,gxm38h,"Ahhhh they were great! They all kept it real but hopeful, which is exactly what we need. Hobi's especially struck me, and Jimin just has this warmth and caring in his words that is very sincere. I'll definitely need to listen to this again! Thank you Bangtan. 💜"
1399,2020-06-07 20:35:46,gxm38h,I’m so glad they all got to speak and tell their own stories.😊
1400,2020-06-07 20:40:25,gxm38h,"Alright Colin said some nice, practical things. As an SNL fan and army it's another small win to see him go after them. 

Now that BTS has spoken and there's some time before the performance, it's time for a food break.  🔥"

1402,2020-06-07 21:37:05,gxm38h,"For some reason I thought this whole thing would be a little more global. I'm glad they've got global artists and speakers (obviously 😊), but where's the students graduating from non-American schools? Maybe they're coming up."

1419,2020-06-08 00:32:11,gxm38h,"You ever been in possession of one (1) fact that you can't stop telling everyone? There's a popular tweet going around right now claiming Spring Day was last performed in 2017. After performances at year-end award shows and JPN fanmeetings, we saw her twice more: [180622 @ Lotte Family Concert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbpjUT2MdhM) and 180707 @ SBS Super Concert in Taipei.

I'm glad we didn't quite suffer two whole years without her. 😭"

1436,2020-06-07 20:03:43,gxm38h,Mrs. Obama's speech was amazing. I want to find a printed version of this.
1437,2020-06-07 20:08:18,gxm38h,"I can't wait to see what BTS has to say if they have a hefty timeslot, too! I hope amazing graduate Mr. Kim Seokjin gets to say some words of his own."

I really really liked the speeches and I can almost visualize the meeting when they were writing these speeches. Jin and JK's struck me for some reason, but I am still processing my thoughts. 

Much love, Bangtan."

1450,2020-06-07 20:53:48,gxm38h,"Great speeches as expected! Love that they all got to speak and told their own stories in their own way 💜💜💜

When they are on ""mainstream"" programmes, in the back of my mind, I'm always wondering how locals will react to them? Are they coming across well? What will someone seeing them for the first time think? It makes me a bit nervous - am I the only weirdo that thinks like this? What's wrong with me? 🤦🏼‍♀️😂"
1451,2020-06-07 21:23:47,gxm38h,"I love how all their speeches are so different so they can resonate with different sorts of people and what they may be going through. Some people resonated with RM’s, JK’s, Jin’s, Suga’s, Jimin’s, and Taehyung’s the most. I personally felt most connected to J-Hope’s words. I love how all their words can inspire all sorts of people with different and tough times they might be going through. The ending was the cutest as well and topped everything off very nicely. No bias here, they were the highlight of the stream for me so far."

1806,2020-06-07 23:02:48,gxm38h,Loll My neighborhood just started cheering right during the tassel flip. (The 7pm cheering for healthcare workers in NYC)
1807,2020-06-07 23:03:00,gxm38h,TIL the tassel is there for a reason. I thought it was just a decoration everyone agreed on or something :P
1808,2020-06-07 23:03:01,gxm38h,I MAY have just grabbed my tassel (which is hanging in my room) and pretended that this was my graduation haha

1838,2020-06-07 23:31:15,gxm38h,"They're about to snatch everybody with this performance. How can you not love them, really?"
1839,2020-06-07 23:31:28,gxm38h,"Jimin really sounds so good, wow 

(Ofc they all do, but I’m always really excited for his strong vocal performances)"
1840,2020-06-07 23:31:59,gxm38h,I honestly thought they would perform all hype songs but I'm glad people can really listen to their vocals through these songs!! 💜
1841,2020-06-07 23:32:24,gxm38h,I STAND HAPPILY CORRECTED ON MY SONG PREDICTIONS EARLIER
1842,2020-06-07 23:33:22,gxm38h,They're being silly and having so much fun!
1843,2020-06-07 23:33:28,gxm38h,That was beautiful 🥺🥺
1844,2020-06-07 23:33:55,gxm38h,Jimin’s microphone switching colors 🤣
1845,2020-06-07 23:34:03,gxm38h,I loved loved loved this!!! I’m so happy they performed songs that I didn’t expect them to perform. Perfect song choices!
1846,2020-06-07 23:34:19,gxm38h,Bang Bang Con can't get here fast enough. Omg.
1847,2020-06-07 23:34:33,gxm38h,Nooo come backk 😭😭😭😭😭
1848,2020-06-07 23:35:34,gxm38h,Well that was super fun. Really missed this. Love and self love for everyone!
1849,2020-06-07 23:40:26,gxm38h,I wonder how many people watched the event 🤔
1850,2020-06-08 00:06:13,gxm38h,"This performance way way beyond my expectations. It was my dreammmm for them to perform spring day and I cannot believe they actually did!! (They were trying to make each other laugh the entire song while I was sobbing listening to SD, typical)

I wasn’t 100% sure if Bangbangcon was going to be worth it, but after this, I’m looking forward to it so much! I miss seeing the dorky boys do cute interactions with each other during their performances, it felt almost like watching a real concert 😭💜"
1851,2020-06-08 00:50:31,gxm38h,"This is probably one of my favourite performances by them, and these aren't even my top Bangtan songs. I just love how comfortable and happy they seemed, I had the silliest smile on my face the whole time just by seeing them enjoy themselves and be so playful 🤗"
1852,2020-06-08 03:17:13,gxm38h,I loved their performance!!! Love love love it!! I waved my arms out of instinct when they started singing. Loved how Spring Day was like YOU THOUGHT I WAS GONE?
1853,2020-06-08 03:36:19,gxm38h,"I woke up just went the final graduation party segment started with Katy Perry. Love that the last two performances were non-English too, something you would never see even 5 years ago  

Loved BTS' performance too, and Spring Day was sooo good. Loved that they sat down and did a chill version of the song. Mikrokosmos had the same energy as the Airplane Pt2 Festa 2020 version. Was expecting to see RM picking up objects in the background, so luckily they were outside the museum during that performance, lol"
1854,2020-06-08 04:34:40,gxm38h,"That performance of Spring Day was...everything. Beautiful vocals, beautiful people, and...they looked SO HAPPY???"
1855,2020-06-07 19:19:26,gxm38h,This isn't applicable to the people who don't have good parents :/ Feel bad for those graduating with no one to cheer them on.
1856,2020-06-07 20:27:20,gxm38h,Hoseok our hope our sunshine
1857,2020-06-08 01:09:46,gxm38h,"Their performance,vibe,energy,outfits, background choice etc were all beautiful and very good just like the song choices. 

But did anyone else notice how most of their singing was lipsyncing or dubbed?? And im not saying that to criticize them because we all know they can sing,im just wondering why. They even made it obvious themselves when they lowered the mic before the sentence finished in many instances. 

BWL felt like it was 100% playback and then in Spring day it felt like they were singing but some parts were obviously dubbed/playback and almost all Mikrokosmos was the same. 

It was also one of the very rare instances that even the rap parts were playback that are live even in the music shows that they re using louder backing track than live shows and you usually cant hear their love vocals clearly. Im just wondering why did they do that? Maybe the set didnt allow very good sound or smth like that but I dont know seems weird."

1968,2020-06-07 23:58:00,gxm38h,"Can I just say all of their voices sounded so smooth, maybe its because I haven't heard them live in a while. Also jin really came for my heart during the performances with his facial expressions and cute dances during mikroksomos"

2264,2020-06-07 23:22:54,gxm38h,I freaked out when I heard that oahh oahh oahh oaahhh. Will always hold a special place in my heart
2265,2020-06-07 23:23:01,gxm38h,Just logged on in time and man I forgot how much I hated BWL suits 😂😂 Hobi’s looks good though.

2310,2020-06-08 09:51:44,gxm38h,"So late to the party but this was absolute perfection! It was so good to see them all again looking so happy while they perform for us. Spring Day was a very nice surprise, thank you boys.

Also, it's been almost 2 decades since I graduated from college but I feel comforted by their message. It's been a rough couple of weeks but today was just amazing. I'm letting my kids watch their speech on their graduation day, that's for sure."
2311,2020-06-07 23:37:55,gxm38h,"No. 463 in questionable style choices, kept wondering which would happen first, Tae tripping over his tassels or whipping them in someone's eyes lol. His shirt also looked like someone glued crepe paper and feathers to it, but I guess I'm no judge of fashion XD I'm also now in need of Jin's jumper, it's just my style."
2312,2020-06-07 23:09:12,gxm38h,I hadn't heard Megan before but I'm bopping

2315,2020-06-07 20:56:14,gxm38h,This reminds me of when me and my cousins would act out random alien planet adventure stories pretending to be people. lol what is going on lol
2316,2020-06-07 21:26:48,gxm38h,Lol
2317,2020-06-07 21:34:15,gxm38h,I still need to see euphoria!!

2324,2020-06-07 23:20:26,gxm38h,"Super excited to wait for BTS! Am I too crazy to hope for a live performance since theirs is the last act? I know there were screenshots of possibly recorded performance, but still...

&#x200B;

P.s So is this CNCO also a Fila ambassador? ~~Or are they also Army or something, with the 7 cap and all.. I like the songs btw!~~ (Apparently not)

&#x200B;

P.s.s okay it's kinda strange seeing the beginning of Boy With Luv without the fanchants!! Too lonely when it was just my voice :p"
2325,2020-06-07 23:20:33,gxm38h,"Oh, that red hat dude is OT7, too"
2326,2020-06-07 23:20:49,gxm38h,thanks to all the telenovelas I had to watch when I was younger I can understand more than a third of the lyrics now lol
2327,2020-06-07 23:21:06,gxm38h,Ahhh I'm not readyyyy
2328,2020-06-07 23:21:07,gxm38h,This probably won't happen because they have choreo but it would be so cute if BTS sang in their dorm
2329,2020-06-07 23:21:12,gxm38h,Ahhh bts
2330,2020-06-07 23:21:15,gxm38h,IT'S HAPPENING

2368,2020-06-07 23:14:21,gxm38h,"No offense or anything, but is this appropriate? Maybe I'm too boomer to understand.

Edit: I'm not trying to say it's bad, y'all. It's great, but just ain't my thing."
2369,2020-06-07 21:21:59,gxm38h,Has she had a stroke? :/
2370,2020-06-07 20:53:33,gxm38h,I already graduated. But all the quotes you mentioned really resonated with me as well. Gonna save your comment. ☺
2371,2020-06-07 20:37:08,gxm38h,At 5.30 am in Korea!! Gotta admire the dedication xD
2372,2020-06-07 20:38:51,gxm38h,It was probably uploaded privately and the intern was waiting to click the publish button. Lololol
2373,2020-06-07 23:54:36,gxm38h,I wholeheartedly agree. I feel like I’m on cloud nine right now. Just seeing their smiley happy faces is everything. Gosh I’m so whipped for them.
2374,2020-06-07 20:32:04,gxm38h,He looked so good
2375,2020-06-07 20:34:21,gxm38h,Same ☠️
2376,2020-06-07 20:35:05,gxm38h,Same! Have to go back and read what he actually said.
2377,2020-06-07 20:35:58,gxm38h,"I swear I couldn’t concentrate on the first seconds,"
2378,2020-06-07 16:59:56,gxm38h,It's so surreal and I'm so proud of them 😭😭😭😭😭
2379,2020-06-07 20:29:34,gxm38h,I wish someone had told me that before I went to uni 😪
2380,2020-06-07 20:34:44,gxm38h,Jin’s speech was so real and so comforting.
2381,2020-06-07 22:59:56,gxm38h,"The Portland protests have had leadership that is consistently reminding them that the protests are great and they're glad everyone showed up, but without political action also, it's not going to be effective. People have to vote. I love seeing young people get on board with it."
2382,2020-06-07 23:40:45,gxm38h,THANK YOU BANGTAN 😭😭😭😭😭
2383,2020-06-07 17:43:22,gxm38h,Ugh I just moved from NY to Seoul and now a bitch is up all night again... 4am to 8am here we goooo
2384,2020-06-07 17:18:38,gxm38h,Ugh I know. Even watching them on James corden is a stretch for me.
2385,2020-06-07 18:58:14,gxm38h,congratulations to you!
2386,2020-06-07 20:33:59,gxm38h,This speaks to me like nothing ever did!
2387,2020-06-07 20:32:24,gxm38h,Same thoughts running through my head.
2388,2020-06-07 20:39:03,gxm38h,"I blocked him out. He can’t ruin my joy lol. Make questionable choices now, deal with the consequences later 🤣"
2389,2020-06-07 20:37:45,gxm38h,I've broken every rule of his Credit Card rules in recent years. LOL. I'm just selective listening so I don't get my feelings hurt.
2390,2020-06-07 21:32:46,gxm38h,RIP K-armys or any other non-English speaking fans just waiting for bts and having every one of their suspicions about Americans confirmed. 🤣
2391,2020-06-07 22:49:06,gxm38h,I took for granted having a president that could form coherent thoughts 😭
2392,2020-06-07 22:47:16,gxm38h,I miss him so so much.
2393,2020-06-07 23:33:25,gxm38h,me and you both 💜
2394,2020-06-07 23:52:54,gxm38h,There was something ff when the fan chants for BWL were missing. I got so used to the screaming crowd it just felt so empty without it for a upbeat song like BWL.  No oh my my my sung with the crowd.
2395,2020-06-07 23:52:10,gxm38h,why can't we post the video onto the subreddit?
2396,2020-06-07 19:54:53,gxm38h,Well...since the Obamas I guess?
2397,2020-06-07 19:56:42,gxm38h,Yep I suddenly want UGH in the background of her speech 😊
2398,2020-06-07 23:36:49,gxm38h,"I literally gasped when I heard the whining noise and was like 'OH MY GOD WHAT!' and my husband just blank stared at me like I was high and I was like 'just go back to reddit, honey, it's ok.'"
2399,2020-06-07 23:44:28,gxm38h,It's a such a GIFTTTT getting to see Queen performed! For all recent army
2400,2020-06-07 23:53:03,gxm38h,This!!!! He sounds so soft😍
2401,2020-06-08 00:05:57,gxm38h,Yessss he wasssss!! Congrats on recognising 🥰🥳🥳
2402,2020-06-07 20:35:54,gxm38h,and the gummy smile made an appearance! what a gift!
2403,2020-06-07 20:58:21,gxm38h,That's smile always do something nice to me...no matter what...I will never get enough of it🥰
2404,2020-06-07 20:33:39,gxm38h,"lmao SAME, and Jin's speech about going at your own pace made me tear up cause it hit so close to home."
2405,2020-06-07 23:41:04,gxm38h,I legit cried for the first time since becoming an ARMY. I missed them so much and things are so icky right now that this all just hit so hard and I just cried tears of joy.
2406,2020-06-07 23:51:27,gxm38h,"Right? I wanted 2 more songs. What the hell. A full blown concert. If only . 
If the BangBangcon concert will be like this then it was money very well spent."
2407,2020-06-07 22:54:00,gxm38h,Can't believe we got two presidential speeches in one day!
2408,2020-06-07 20:37:16,gxm38h,"Yes, they both brought tears to my eyes but for different but overlapping emotions."
2409,2020-06-08 00:06:02,gxm38h,OMGGGG
2410,2020-06-07 21:39:07,gxm38h,Same. I’m watching the ones I want to see but the other times i’m on my phone reading comments on this ~~love~~ live thread. Lol
2411,2020-06-07 21:42:48,gxm38h,YES I couldn't agree more! I just thought this too; like it feels like it should be 4 a.m. for an award show just waiting for the final bit.
2412,2020-06-07 21:39:14,gxm38h,Feels good.
2413,2020-06-08 02:04:35,gxm38h,Taehyung was really in his element! His facial expressions stole my heart
2414,2020-06-07 20:13:41,gxm38h,Every coming up announcement has had them. They know who is watching 😂
2415,2020-06-07 20:13:44,gxm38h,Aww I saw that and got excited but I legit JUST tuned in.
2416,2020-06-07 20:39:33,gxm38h,I noticed that too. Is that a Korean thing or not? I’ve heard other Korean speakers do that before.
2417,2020-06-07 21:28:27,gxm38h,It's honestly mind-blowing the way fans have mobilized to match the donation. Many fans have been donating since last week and they're still donating and promoting the donation drive on social media
2418,2020-06-07 21:27:47,gxm38h,I love army so much
2419,2020-06-07 21:43:36,gxm38h,Their friendship cracks me up. You know Martha grows the BEST weed and sends it to Snoop along with an apple pie.
2420,2020-06-07 21:44:51,gxm38h,That was no mistake for sure. I love those two together.
2421,2020-06-07 23:36:47,gxm38h,I remembered your comment when I saw them start performing! I can't believe he spoiled ANOTHER thing
2422,2020-06-07 23:38:57,gxm38h,"I think I read and liked your replay today! Bless you, you have golden fingers, keep on typing beautiful things like that into existence!"

2424,2020-06-08 00:11:27,gxm38h,This!!!
2425,2020-06-07 20:45:08,gxm38h,"I completely agree. I am far past graduations but even as a professional “adult,” so much of what they said resonated. 💜💜"
2426,2020-06-07 23:57:11,gxm38h,He was REALLY in his element tonight
2427,2020-06-08 00:04:22,gxm38h,"I’m really falling in love with his whole vibe. He makes everything look and sound so effortless. His dancing especially. I can’t even explain it. 

Those shoes tho..."
2428,2020-06-08 00:02:24,gxm38h,I wonder how many locals had their heart snatched by him
2429,2020-06-08 00:06:43,gxm38h,I got Tae wrecked hard today!!! He was killing me with everything today. Just
2430,2020-06-08 07:07:30,gxm38h,Dude. Yes. The man had swagger tonight.
2431,2020-06-07 19:37:37,gxm38h,Same!
2432,2020-06-07 19:39:19,gxm38h,Omg yes
2433,2020-06-07 20:34:11,gxm38h,Yep. Hearts were def snatched.
2434,2020-06-07 20:32:54,gxm38h,I ended up hugging my pillow so hard. Lmao
2435,2020-06-07 20:45:31,gxm38h,"There's a saying that graduating in 4 years is like leaving a party early. 😉

It took me more than 4 yrs but taking that extra time took tons of pressure off my shoulder and that last year was seriously the best year in my entire undergrad. It gave me room for new projects, connections, and classes I would not have done if I tried to rush it. So take your time and enjoy!"
2436,2020-06-07 23:33:17,gxm38h,We can double up and save costs. I'm ded.
2437,2020-06-07 23:42:02,gxm38h,How can we come if we are all dead?
2438,2020-06-07 19:25:45,gxm38h,Right?? And damn do they look good. I'm getting UN vibes again. Dark haired bangtan in suits never disappoints.
2439,2020-06-07 19:20:08,gxm38h,I miss them so much.
2440,2020-06-07 20:31:44,gxm38h,YES.
2441,2020-06-07 20:32:53,gxm38h,Omg it's up daebaakkk
2442,2020-06-07 20:33:24,gxm38h,Yes. Rewatching later.

2444,2020-06-08 00:33:55,gxm38h,Someone is cutting onions :((
2445,2020-06-07 19:23:57,gxm38h,"i was literally at a protest yesterday, everyone kneeling and wearing masks."
2446,2020-06-07 19:25:11,gxm38h,OMG PLEASE!!!!😯😯😯American Armys please make it happen!
2447,2020-06-07 20:10:42,gxm38h,I laughed and cried a little at that 😭
2448,2020-06-07 22:59:56,gxm38h,Jesus I totally feel you there.
2449,2020-06-07 23:16:10,gxm38h,same 🤭
2450,2020-06-07 23:16:52,gxm38h,Hmm 💅🏻
2451,2020-06-07 23:17:11,gxm38h,lol underrated comment
2452,2020-06-07 23:19:03,gxm38h,Me too!
2453,2020-06-07 23:19:00,gxm38h,How so? :P
2454,2020-06-07 17:17:29,gxm38h,"Thanks, that means I have plenty of time to do the dishes in between :P Or play some terraria. Wherever my priorities decide to lie lol"
2455,2020-06-07 19:20:33,gxm38h,I want him back and I'm not even american. Can us English folk share him too? XD
2456,2020-06-07 19:28:51,gxm38h,I definitely only put it on for BTS but I’m glad I’m watching all of this.
2457,2020-06-07 19:46:00,gxm38h,Right?? Replace YouTube rewind with this!
2458,2020-06-07 20:37:07,gxm38h,Was it 12 mins long?
2459,2020-06-07 20:56:15,gxm38h,"And it's exciting to think it's the same for locals seeing bts for the first time, too!"
2460,2020-06-07 23:37:17,gxm38h,ikr. just realized i missed them so muchh
2461,2020-06-07 23:41:05,gxm38h,"The song choices were perfect.  The order they performed them were perfect too, ending with something light and happy."
2462,2020-06-07 23:54:15,gxm38h,This was me too!!! I screamed when I realized what they were singing. I couldn't be happier with their song choice
2463,2020-06-08 00:02:41,gxm38h,You get spring day cuz its your cake day!!!
2464,2020-06-08 00:07:36,gxm38h,The answer is obv YES!
2465,2020-06-08 00:08:42,gxm38h,I just noticed they switched mics at the end!! Jimin has the green and V has the gold
2466,2020-06-08 00:42:24,gxm38h,But did she ever leave? 😂
2467,2020-06-07 19:55:38,gxm38h,It means so much more than a singular moment right now. It’s truly a message for all of us.
2468,2020-06-07 20:34:16,gxm38h,"Army’s are so talented.

Edit: oh it’s BTS lol ahahhha"
2469,2020-06-07 20:48:19,gxm38h,I've been SUPER impressed by all of the speeches. This has been well done.
2470,2020-06-07 23:34:42,gxm38h,Yup
2471,2020-06-07 23:43:05,gxm38h,"""Jungkook in jeans""

I agree."
2472,2020-06-07 23:43:43,gxm38h,95z vibing away. Happy 95z = happy everyone
2473,2020-06-08 01:24:38,gxm38h,[you mean like this](https://twitter.com/glossbuns/status/1269777458309459968?s=20)
2474,2020-06-07 23:45:34,gxm38h,YES!! 12.30 AM TO 5AM for me but TOTALLY TOTALLY ABSOLUTELY WORTH IT
2475,2020-06-08 00:06:05,gxm38h,I just want to make him my bff!
2476,2020-06-07 23:50:41,gxm38h,He always sings Spring Day in a slightly different vocal tone/colour. Like its really soft and smooth. I really love it. Would love to have him sing like that in another song too. Kind of does in Mikrokosmos but not for very long.
2477,2020-06-07 23:49:38,gxm38h,Jin really stood out to me in these performances!! Also I really want the sweatshirt he wore for Mikrokosmos lol
2478,2020-06-07 19:10:17,gxm38h,So good lol!
2479,2020-06-07 19:20:02,gxm38h,Same!! She is so gorgeous no matter what but this look even more!
2480,2020-06-07 20:05:26,gxm38h,It's a reminder to keep a tissue box nearby!
2481,2020-06-07 20:05:45,gxm38h,I wonder since they have so much time if they'll all have some time to speak 👀
2482,2020-06-07 20:51:49,gxm38h,Yes! I love how each individual speech are personal and reflective of their personalities.
2483,2020-06-07 21:01:02,gxm38h,AHHHH SO TRUE
2484,2020-06-07 23:12:08,gxm38h,Imagining their mouths open hehe
2485,2020-06-07 23:14:09,gxm38h,Who is most likely to twerk along with the song?
2486,2020-06-07 23:30:32,gxm38h,So SMILEY 😭😭😭
2487,2020-06-08 00:00:56,gxm38h,It seems they went more emotional than athem like . Also ON is quite demanding  vocals and dancing alike.  I think just seeing them sitting down and slaying those vocals and having fun is much more personal  and comforting than a powerful we will survive song.
2488,2020-06-07 23:36:36,gxm38h,"me too! it would be perfect for the graduation theme, no?

but spring day was a perfect choice as well."
2489,2020-06-07 23:36:38,gxm38h,I need fan cams/edits of Joon during Mikrokosmos ASAP ty
2490,2020-06-07 23:34:25,gxm38h,Brave of you to assume he ONLY carries it for BWL.
2491,2020-06-07 23:35:59,gxm38h,I love how most of them dance like old men when they're not choreographed. It makes my heart so happy.
2492,2020-06-07 23:41:35,gxm38h,I noticed that too! I hope we'll get to see more next weekend!
2493,2020-06-08 00:23:10,gxm38h,A proud and old 2012 here.
2494,2020-06-08 00:46:25,gxm38h,Yup lol 2011 and then 2015
2495,2020-06-08 03:52:57,gxm38h,From high school class of 2010 here! Shoutout to my fellow 2010 grads!
2496,2020-06-07 19:40:03,gxm38h,What’s your story.
2497,2020-06-07 19:42:31,gxm38h,"It'll be shocking in unexpected ways, but you'll be alright 🥰 And it'll give you loads of confidence once you've settled down. All the best 🤗"
2498,2020-06-07 19:44:18,gxm38h,Me too. So many good songs and comforting lyrics 🥺
2499,2020-06-07 20:17:33,gxm38h,Truth bombbbb
2500,2020-06-07 20:45:44,gxm38h,[deleted]
2501,2020-06-07 20:43:39,gxm38h,"Lol! A mood, though"
2502,2020-06-07 21:14:08,gxm38h,He did? Omg aww
2503,2020-06-07 20:48:54,gxm38h,ok but same lmao
2504,2020-06-07 20:49:50,gxm38h,We are on the same page haha!! Even though I'm not a graduate (I'll graduate in 2021).
2505,2020-06-07 21:01:46,gxm38h,"What did he say, please? I missed it"
2506,2020-06-07 21:01:50,gxm38h,younger? STILL
2507,2020-06-07 21:02:24,gxm38h,10 Things I Hate About You was my first introduction to the epic crush that was JGL.
2508,2020-06-07 21:01:01,gxm38h,Yas. Please me too.
2509,2020-06-07 21:02:50,gxm38h,"Same, and I still do if I'm being honest."
2510,2020-06-07 23:08:40,gxm38h,"find peace for now and keep fighting! as Seokjin said, I hope you can turn something into an opportunity for you!"
2511,2020-06-07 23:17:46,gxm38h,"I'm sorry to hear about you losing your job. Since you're a technical writer, I think some companies are still hiring remote technical writers."
2512,2020-06-07 23:06:50,gxm38h,SAME
2513,2020-06-07 23:08:45,gxm38h,Yes 🥺
2514,2020-06-07 23:09:30,gxm38h,Lol that was *the* song back in the day.
2515,2020-06-07 23:14:54,gxm38h,I hope so!
2516,2020-06-07 23:15:30,gxm38h,I am really hoping for this 😭
2517,2020-06-07 23:26:46,gxm38h,I was just thinking the same thing!
2518,2020-06-07 23:45:11,gxm38h,Hands up who'd join him ^^^me
2519,2020-06-07 23:34:31,gxm38h,Literally same I did not see 2/3 coming
2520,2020-06-07 21:24:33,gxm38h,it's been reinstated! Thanks!
2521,2020-06-07 21:09:10,gxm38h,"Me too. I've been watching everyone's speeches (not just BTS's) and were I a graduate of 2020, I'd be feeling a bit of pressure to go change the world. I like how Jin's message was that it's ok to take a breathe and to go at your own pace. I felt like all of BTS's messages provided comfort in some way."
2522,2020-06-07 21:04:26,gxm38h,Mine too. His and Yoongi's 100% spoke to my soul. They were so relatable.
2523,2020-06-07 23:34:28,gxm38h,"He is, he's adorable and was obviously in a great mood when they filmed this!"
2524,2020-06-07 23:32:52,gxm38h,He’s amazing!
2525,2020-06-07 23:34:08,gxm38h,He truly did omg
2526,2020-06-07 23:37:53,gxm38h,he looks gorgeous as well.
2527,2020-06-08 00:01:59,gxm38h,He totally is!! He did for me.
2528,2020-06-07 19:09:13,gxm38h,Very warm and heartfelt feelings.
2529,2020-06-07 19:15:44,gxm38h,Same lol
2530,2020-06-07 19:17:38,gxm38h,ngl that’s what my mind went to when the marching band came in lol
2531,2020-06-07 19:32:30,gxm38h,Me tooo! M not sure I'll survive BTS's wisdom
2532,2020-06-07 19:38:54,gxm38h,"I recommend countdown, green light, I care, 1+1, and halo my personal favorites."
2533,2020-06-07 19:44:35,gxm38h,Voice is great.
2534,2020-06-07 20:22:00,gxm38h,YES YES YES YES YES YES YES 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
2535,2020-06-07 20:42:47,gxm38h,Team Food Break 🥘
2536,2020-06-07 21:41:27,gxm38h,"It’s not stated explicitly but I think it’s very much directed at US graduates, which is a missed opportunity tbh given YT is such a global platform"
2537,2020-06-07 21:38:21,gxm38h,"I think this was organized in the United States for US graduates, but is for everyone!"
2538,2020-06-07 22:22:39,gxm38h,You might have about 45-60 mins to power nap! We’re about halfway done with part 4. And BTS is the last segment to part 5.
2539,2020-06-07 22:23:59,gxm38h,you can do it! hang in there!
2540,2020-06-07 23:37:13,gxm38h,Or 2.30 am. I second that!
2541,2020-06-07 23:53:57,gxm38h,"Me too 1.30 am, but I can't sleep now. Rip me at my uni classes today at 8 am ."
2542,2020-06-07 20:01:24,gxm38h,Already in shambles and I KNOW IM GOING TO BE shaking when Joon speaks oooooomgggg
2543,2020-06-07 23:36:29,gxm38h,woah hahah time to rewatch!
2544,2020-06-07 23:36:59,gxm38h,OMG so fast!! Thanks!
2545,2020-06-07 23:52:30,gxm38h,Rolled up sleeves and tattoos..........goodbye world...
2546,2020-06-07 23:47:24,gxm38h,"Wait, what?"
2547,2020-06-08 00:03:21,gxm38h,And when he wears a short-sleeved shirt when it gets too hot on Tour... goodbye world
2548,2020-06-08 04:26:42,gxm38h,Yep...Yoongi ultimate tsundere. I love it
2549,2020-06-07 19:00:16,gxm38h,"Yup, I stan a good leader :P"
2550,2020-06-07 19:22:33,gxm38h,It’s the complete and kind sentences of hope and strong leadership. Feels good.
2551,2020-06-07 19:23:45,gxm38h,Sometimes I forget how much I miss them and then I hear them speak 😭😭
2552,2020-06-07 19:08:24,gxm38h,"Yes — she’s comforting, inspiring, and strong & gentle at the same time. I really like the way she speaks"
2553,2020-06-07 19:26:44,gxm38h,"Agree. I wasn’t really sure what to expect, but this is really amazing."
2554,2020-06-07 20:35:47,gxm38h,Is there anywhere J-Hope's hot body? Are you curious? :))))
2555,2020-06-07 20:39:43,gxm38h,He is an SNL cast member :)
2556,2020-06-07 20:39:50,gxm38h,Co-host of weekend update on SNL!
2557,2020-06-07 20:58:14,gxm38h,I have the same thoughts when I see them on mainstream programs as well.
2558,2020-06-07 21:16:14,gxm38h,"Na I 'm wondering about it too.
I thought they did amazing. 
I'll bet some locals will be taken aback by their looks, especially JK and Tae."
2559,2020-06-07 21:28:56,gxm38h,Yes! I love that all seven of them are individuals who complement each other and speak to different people at different points in their lives.
2560,2020-06-07 21:42:05,gxm38h,She genuinely seems like a really great person.
2561,2020-06-07 21:45:17,gxm38h,i told my crush i liked him and idk what happened bc my brain has completely blocked it off so it must've been bad
2562,2020-06-07 21:51:45,gxm38h,"I told the guy I had a HUGE crush on in junior high that I used to like him on our last day of high school. He just said “Yeah, I knew.” GREAT. Glad to know you didn’t give a shit. 🙄"
2563,2020-06-07 22:04:56,gxm38h,"This is cute.   It's better that you told him though, as boys in high school can be oblivious.  My husband was a prom date for one of my friends in high school.  Talking about it now, he says it didn't even occur to him that she might be interested in him, even though she asked him to go to prom with her, because she didn't explicitly say she was interested."
2564,2020-06-07 21:44:00,gxm38h,So bc you said it’s embarrassing that it didn’t go well?
2565,2020-06-07 21:56:29,gxm38h,"I wrote mine a love letter (this was a long time ago I don't know if people still write love letters lmao) and gave to him on the last day of our school year, and I never found out what his reaction was because I left for Canada 2 months later and never saw him again"
2566,2020-06-07 23:02:19,gxm38h,I didnt even know she's pregnant .-.
2567,2020-06-07 23:02:24,gxm38h,Same I was confused for a moment lol
2568,2020-06-07 23:09:26,gxm38h,BWL and ON please please please!
2569,2020-06-07 23:08:09,gxm38h,If they're the closer maybe even 4??
2570,2020-06-07 23:40:08,gxm38h,BOGO SHIPDAAAAAAAA 😭😭😭😭😭
2571,2020-06-07 19:39:09,gxm38h,Same. I'd have never known this otherwise so happy right now
2572,2020-06-07 20:26:38,gxm38h,SAME
2573,2020-06-07 23:51:40,gxm38h,The locations were so nice. Do you know where they were set?
2574,2020-06-07 19:56:02,gxm38h,Because it is!! 👍🏼
2575,2020-06-07 19:58:24,gxm38h,It's always been relevant sweetie💜💜💜
2576,2020-06-07 16:11:08,gxm38h,A speech is much longer.
2577,2020-06-07 19:16:51,gxm38h,Does this mean a full ON performance with marching band and dancers it not out of the question? 👀
2578,2020-06-07 19:36:59,gxm38h,"Education isn't limited to formal institutions. Knowledge can come in many forms, as long as you never stop learning."
2579,2020-06-07 19:32:36,gxm38h,Don't feel bad about it! I think they are saying it especially now for these Grads who's did it. But that doesn't mean those who don't go aren't successful or powerful.
2580,2020-06-07 19:32:33,gxm38h,"Don’t forget it’s never to late if you want to. 20,30,40,50,60 and beyond. You’re still important if you don’t."
2581,2020-06-07 19:48:51,gxm38h,Beyoncé just said she didn’t go to college and look at her - it’s ok! Education is more than a degree.
2582,2020-06-07 19:35:36,gxm38h,"If you’re from the US, just to let you know that gap years (years in between highschool and college that you take for a break or to work) is actually very popular abroad. And if you don’t ever want to go to college, then that is also okay! It isn’t for everyone and we all have our own paths to take! 

Stay strong and good luck!"
2583,2020-06-07 19:43:24,gxm38h,"It's okay, Yoongi's got you"
2584,2020-06-07 19:48:04,gxm38h,College isn’t always the answer. 💜
2585,2020-06-07 19:47:18,gxm38h,We all did.
2586,2020-06-07 19:50:30,gxm38h,I smiled at this and felt this to my soul. But we do gotta save ourselves too ✊
2587,2020-06-07 19:54:42,gxm38h,"Right? I've teared up THRICE Already and I'm not graduating? And it's not even BTS! 

DIDN'T KNOW this is what we needed"
2588,2020-06-07 19:54:23,gxm38h,Don’t forget to drink water!
2589,2020-06-07 20:10:26,gxm38h,Right? Haha
2590,2020-06-07 20:11:31,gxm38h,Agreed!
2591,2020-06-07 20:18:43,gxm38h,"Philosophy may not pay the bills, but it’s helped me stay sane more than anything else in my life. Always more to learn, more to think about, etc. definitely underrated."
2592,2020-06-07 20:16:48,gxm38h,Looooool me too 😂😂😂
2593,2020-06-07 20:36:57,gxm38h,I actually just bleached my hair moments before.... I felt that
2594,2020-06-07 21:09:27,gxm38h,It’s on Amazon Prime! I watch it every day! One of the best sitcoms ever!
2595,2020-06-07 21:05:28,gxm38h,"Third rock from the sun! Don’t worry many know ;D

That show was hilarious from memory"
2596,2020-06-07 21:55:53,gxm38h,I love Chris Pine but Chris Evans is #1 for me.
2597,2020-06-07 22:51:37,gxm38h,🔥🔥🔥
2598,2020-06-07 23:40:21,gxm38h,Both the speech and performance was up the moment they ended! Bangtantv noona really had her finger on the go public button! Lol
2599,2020-06-08 00:22:08,gxm38h,"I think it may have been cuts from different performances. We don't actually see the switch, but it was funny nonetheless.

That plus Joon and Jin dancing in the background was hilarious"
2600,2020-06-08 00:54:52,gxm38h,Totally agree! I'm so happy I fell into the BTS rabbithole 5 weeks ago. They are such special human beings.
2601,2020-06-08 00:26:33,gxm38h,"Spanish subs says ""Museo nacional de Corea"" and that's it."
2602,2020-06-08 04:07:19,gxm38h,"Not sure if it's possible but I'm hoping they'll update the subs later. Like what is the point of subbing if all it's gonna mention is ""\[singing in Korean\]""...? lol"
2603,2020-06-07 19:57:47,gxm38h,What I wouldn’t give for BTS to perform UGH! Tonight.
2604,2020-06-07 23:38:45,gxm38h,congratulations to you!!!
2605,2020-06-07 19:11:30,gxm38h,Exactly! I'm here for it!
2606,2020-06-07 19:16:40,gxm38h,Imagine if tae starts posting on weverse like during bangbangcon
2607,2020-06-07 19:16:57,gxm38h,"4am KST, probably not :("
2608,2020-06-07 19:44:45,gxm38h,I think it said that Finneas (aka Billie Eilish’s brother) was the producer?
2609,2020-06-07 19:44:17,gxm38h,Was just thinking this lol. This editor and mixer needs a raise. Methinks it's Finneas.
2610,2020-06-07 19:47:36,gxm38h,"who was the one girl? not Noah Cyrus, but the other one was the only one I couldn’t recognize"
2611,2020-06-07 19:50:27,gxm38h,Video and sound editors the uncredited mvps of this pandemic.
2612,2020-06-07 19:44:33,gxm38h,Yes! Chris Martin
2613,2020-06-07 19:44:29,gxm38h,It’s him
2614,2020-06-07 20:26:51,gxm38h,"I’m thinking they had to all dye it brown or black because it’s such a formal event so they wanted to chill on the hair colors, maybe!"
2615,2020-06-07 20:29:58,gxm38h,"dont worry, we're gonna go with ""the third from the left"" or something like that XD"
2616,2020-06-07 20:33:15,gxm38h,"They all introduced themselves though, so you can't ask for more than that! 😂"
2617,2020-06-07 21:36:27,gxm38h,:) here's one ***hug*** for you
2618,2020-06-07 21:14:35,gxm38h,"While we're dreaming, what's a girl have to do to get a performance of Home?"
2619,2020-06-07 21:15:33,gxm38h,I hope they're saving her for next weekend's concert lol
2620,2020-06-07 21:44:35,gxm38h,My husband just made me a banana daiquiri. We've got good taste in men. c:
2621,2020-06-07 22:04:53,gxm38h,"Apply with a light hand and use a swishing move back and forth. You can always apply more, but it's harder to adjust when you apply heavily right away. Start with a beige colour for your base before putting on darker/more vibrant colours. I usually just use dark eyeshadow for the corners of my eyes unless it's a heavy smokey look I'm going for. 

Eye shadow primer is a must so your eyeshadow doesn't run, crease or melt hours later."
2622,2020-06-07 22:05:22,gxm38h,"SAME 😭. I have really small eyelids.

These people are blending like 6 different shades on there, and I’m like “Sis WHERE” — my liner takes up half my eyelid, and I don’t even do it that thick"
2623,2020-06-07 22:46:13,gxm38h,Can’t do eyeliner. It’s super difficult and my hands are always shaking and my eyelids keep fluttering all involuntary 😂
2624,2020-06-07 21:59:24,gxm38h,SAME HERE!
2625,2020-06-07 21:59:26,gxm38h,This is me.
2626,2020-06-07 22:52:34,gxm38h,Do a high IQ move and decorate your glasses instead :P
2627,2020-06-07 22:08:09,gxm38h,"same, also according to him I am very intelligent"
2628,2020-06-07 22:17:39,gxm38h,Jinx. Lol.
2629,2020-06-07 23:01:30,gxm38h,hey what's good
2630,2020-06-07 23:04:10,gxm38h,Congrats!!!
2631,2020-06-07 23:05:53,gxm38h,Congratulations!!
2632,2020-06-07 23:19:38,gxm38h,What songs do you recommend then? :P
2633,2020-06-07 23:20:08,gxm38h,GO DELULU OR GO HOME!!!! 🤡🤡🤡 IT'S THE ONLY ARMY WAY!
2634,2020-06-07 23:23:42,gxm38h,SAME. 😂
2635,2020-06-07 23:34:44,gxm38h,RIGHT!
2636,2020-06-07 23:27:59,gxm38h,[deleted]
2637,2020-06-07 23:40:41,gxm38h,probably trying to recreate so what in the more graceful settings. cutie!
2638,2020-06-07 23:51:12,gxm38h,I wish they had done that too. I don't understand why they didn't.
2639,2020-06-07 23:35:32,gxm38h,Yes me too! Mikrokosmos always makes me feel emotional for that reason. I’ve got a video on my phone of the ‘nananana’ and the big army sign rising up as fireworks go off at Wembley 🥺
2640,2020-06-07 23:34:30,gxm38h,Same here! :(
2641,2020-06-07 23:34:51,gxm38h,"Same. I said out loud in my apt, ""spring day!?!"" 😁"
2642,2020-06-07 23:37:36,gxm38h,I saw it and went 'OH NO' and started sobbing. My mom kept saying 'let me take your picture. Let me!' 🤣
2643,2020-06-08 00:20:25,gxm38h,"Ikr! He was dancing in the background the entire time!

Edit: Jin too! He looked like he was doing an old man walk, while RM was trying out dance spins XD"
2644,2020-06-07 19:42:53,gxm38h,💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
2645,2020-06-07 20:08:55,gxm38h,I LOVE watching their YouTuber room renovations!! 🥰
2646,2020-06-07 20:07:49,gxm38h,Yes
2647,2020-06-07 20:18:44,gxm38h,SAME AAHHHHHHHHHH
2648,2020-06-07 20:33:49,gxm38h,They did already! Its on their BangtanTV youtube channel!
2649,2020-06-07 20:35:55,gxm38h,We will be updating this thread with links as we get them. The BTS commencement speech has already been added above!
2650,2020-06-07 22:01:50,gxm38h,They radiate happy couple energy in the most positive ways.
2651,2020-06-07 22:32:15,gxm38h,"I think it would be absurd to call them ""headliners"" and only give them one song. Two minimum please, yt. 🥺"
2652,2020-06-07 22:30:46,gxm38h,It looks like they're the last to perform so I'm hopeful that it'll be more than one song.
2653,2020-06-07 22:48:17,gxm38h,Same. Therefore I claim this one.
2654,2020-06-07 22:52:51,gxm38h,Yeah.  I skipped out my graduation ceremony to early start my vacation travels.  I was so disillusioned by my profession that I had spent years and  so much money on to get a degree.     But the actual work in that same profession turned out great - so it taught me not to write off a profession without actually experiencing it.
2655,2020-06-07 23:15:35,gxm38h,Lololol only thing I recognised too
2656,2020-06-07 23:17:16,gxm38h,"I said that too, I'm old"
2657,2020-06-07 23:16:52,gxm38h,Texan ARMY unite!
2658,2020-06-07 23:19:33,gxm38h,YEEHAW BABYYYY
2659,2020-06-07 18:23:43,gxm38h,I'm sure it will be available on Youtube for free since it is a Youtube event
2660,2020-06-07 18:59:02,gxm38h,"Same, but I've never been to uni lol"
2661,2020-06-07 20:17:13,gxm38h,2 yrd program instead of the conventional 4 yrs
2662,2020-06-07 20:17:18,gxm38h,Bachelor’s is a 4 year degree. Associate is a 2 year degree. Like junior college or community college (shout out to the sitcom “Community”!) 🤪
2663,2020-06-07 20:17:24,gxm38h,An Associate's Degree is a 2-year degree that is usually for education certificates and the likes; a BA/BS is only found at a 4-year university/college.
2664,2020-06-07 20:17:26,gxm38h,"A bachelor's degree is from a college/university, yes! An associate's degree is 2 years, while bachelor's degree is typically 4 years. I believe the order is associates, bachelors, masters, then doctorate degree."
2665,2020-06-07 20:18:30,gxm38h,you are exactly right you can get a bachelors from a college or university! An associates degree is a degree obtained from something we call community college which is a two-year institution. I hope that made sense!
2666,2020-06-07 20:18:32,gxm38h,Typically in US college are smaller than a university but not by rule and both offer 4-year degrees (like bachelors) or graduate degrees like masters or doctorates.
2667,2020-06-07 20:18:43,gxm38h,You graduate with a bachelors from both college and university. They are basically equal with colleges typically being smaller in size than universities. An associates degrees is the halfway point between a high school degree and a bachelors. Typically you can get them after two years of college.
2668,2020-06-07 20:19:13,gxm38h,"College is the same as university in the US although universities tend to be larger. You get a bachelor’s degree from college/university after about 4 years (could be more or less depending on field of study and whether you’re a full time student). 

An associates degree is a degree that takes 2 years to earn (basically the first two years of a bachelors degree)"
2669,2020-06-07 20:31:55,gxm38h,He was trying to say obscure 😄
2670,2020-06-07 20:31:57,gxm38h,Obscure
2671,2020-06-07 20:43:21,gxm38h,"same, and i'm 22."
2672,2020-06-07 20:40:10,gxm38h,The schedule seems very set so far
2673,2020-06-07 20:45:10,gxm38h,I definitely had to watch a second time on YouTube because I am easily distracted by their faces; Jimin's eyes were pretty entrancing and I kind of forgot he was speaking a language I don't know.
2674,2020-06-07 21:00:26,gxm38h,Hi! Are the speeches of the other speakers going to be uploaded too? I would also like to watch them but it's 5 AM in our timezone and I want to go back to sleep cause I work later
2675,2020-06-07 20:52:11,gxm38h,"LOL well he was at Stanford and it is in Northern California so pretty far from the famous beaches he was probably talking about!  I remember as a freshman at Stanford going to the beach, it was over the foothills and very remote, a very different beach experience than you think of in Southern Cal!"
2676,2020-06-07 20:53:21,gxm38h,I too am for online graduations forever. And hated my in person graduation.
2677,2020-06-07 20:53:31,gxm38h,it's also interesting how i now understand the value of a physical graduation in the span of just two hours compared to three years of undergrad studies 😭
2678,2020-06-07 20:59:01,gxm38h,...MARIAH?????????
2679,2020-06-07 20:59:15,gxm38h,😮
2680,2020-06-07 21:06:17,gxm38h,Then the world will collectively cry together. Especially if they decide to include translation subtitles.
2681,2020-06-07 21:34:33,gxm38h,Hmmm — wearing grey so I’m ‘bout to not match with mine 🍷
2682,2020-06-07 23:12:43,gxm38h,"I was thinking BWL/Dionysus, but apparently it's gonna be more than 2."
2683,2020-06-07 23:34:11,gxm38h,Jimin sounds AMAZING; I wonder if he's had vocal lessons during the downtime they've had. His voice didn't scoop or pitch like it usually does when he starts his lines; he came in pure and clean. He did an amazing job.
2684,2020-06-07 23:42:56,gxm38h,I almost instantly hit post-concert-depression. I want more!
2685,2020-06-07 19:21:35,gxm38h,Or to people who literally hate graduation ceremonies like me. But it’s still really nice to hear for others. So far 10/10 support virtual graduation ceremonies more . Then everyone feels supported .
2686,2020-06-07 19:24:17,gxm38h,":(

I hope those people have the support of friends/siblings and their teachers/professors. Everyone deserves support for their accomplishments"
2687,2020-06-08 01:12:13,gxm38h,"Came here to see if anyone was discussing this. One possibility that came in my head was that they did live vocals and then somehow it didn't turn out well? I feel like usually when everyone else is dubbed, the rap line NEVER is, so it was very strange to hear it."
2688,2020-06-08 01:52:29,gxm38h,"I could be wrong, but I thought BWL sounded live (I could especially hear Jin's breathing/huffing in time with his jumps/kicks). 

Regardless, they sounded amazing! Especially Spring Day, my goodness."
2689,2020-06-08 02:18:51,gxm38h,"I am not sure whether it was live or not. But if it was dubbed, it was because of the place. BTS had the performance outside of the museum. And it could have a bad effect on the sound. So they could not use the live version of the performance. Anyway the performance was so good that i watch it repeatedly. It is so addicted. I love their happy face and good singing and rapping."
2690,2020-06-08 07:34:08,gxm38h,"It was clearly filmed in a couple of takes. Jks shirt sleeve is down one second and buttoned up the next. Also jimin and V's microphones magically swapping several times. I'm guessing they used the live vocals but a mash up of visual takes, which then makes the audio slightly out with the visual?? Amazing performance though,  loved every second of it"
2691,2020-06-08 07:37:09,gxm38h,"Everything sounded like they sang live to me, but it looks like they had multiple takes. It seems they spliced together the best part from each take. It's super noticable in Mikrokosmos where people in the background looks like they are teleporting whenever they change cuts. That's why some parts of the video doesn't match with the audio but at some parts they do. 

The audio also undergone some editing/post processing, so it sounds smoother than true live version, but not as clean as a true studio version. They also never perform without MR unless it's an unplugged version. So at some parts when the mic is too low, you only hear the MR. Which is a problem I have even during a proper concert performance. Sometimes when watching fancams I can't hear their voices when they sing in a lower volume, but if I replay the performance on a livestream/DVD version, where MR is mixed lower, I can hear their voices better."

2693,2020-06-07 19:29:25,gxm38h,I believe about an hour each (approximate)
2694,2020-06-07 19:29:31,gxm38h,About an hour.
2695,2020-06-07 19:29:34,gxm38h,Roughly an hour each
2696,2020-06-07 19:29:46,gxm38h,About 1 hour each if I'm not mistaken

2699,2020-06-07 20:06:27,gxm38h,Nope you’re right on time! BTS’s speech is coming fairly soon
2700,2020-06-07 20:06:42,gxm38h,No BTS yet.
2701,2020-06-07 20:08:07,gxm38h,Yes! I am excited; there are green cherries on the trees :)

2703,2020-06-07 21:00:16,gxm38h,Lol. David's face was my face when she came on.
2704,2020-06-07 21:18:42,gxm38h,Except the part where she was part of an administration that actively made those issues worse
2705,2020-06-07 22:38:49,gxm38h,Mte. They are slaying them.
2706,2020-06-07 23:19:42,gxm38h,Google CNCO mock BTS. Then think about it again.

2709,2020-06-07 23:18:43,gxm38h,Lol I was wondering the same thing !
2710,2020-06-07 23:25:12,gxm38h,"right!! as much as the current situation sucks, at least their voices are so well rested and clear 💜💜"
2711,2020-06-07 23:27:51,gxm38h,I was literally talking to my friend before this saying that it would be sooooo fitting if they sang spring day and akbejdnxbbsmsmskd IM SOSOSO happy omgggg lemme cry with u

And I loved loved BTS' speech."
2729,2020-06-07 21:34:47,gxm38h,I think everyone is popping in for the people they want to see. There’s people I’m looking forward to in every block so I’ll be here the whole time lol
2730,2020-06-07 23:20:39,gxm38h,"If you ever work in corporate, public service or politics, you will understand"
2731,2020-06-07 19:13:45,gxm38h,Big mood lol
2732,2020-06-07 20:51:41,gxm38h,It’s fine. Everyone needs breaks .
2733,2020-06-07 20:59:10,gxm38h,Yes! Such a good and funny movie 🐩
2734,2020-06-07 21:31:56,gxm38h,How come?
2735,2020-06-07 21:33:38,gxm38h,Oh no. Why.
2736,2020-06-07 22:07:12,gxm38h,another women’s college alum?! i’m not Barnard but am a fellow seven sisters alum!
2737,2020-06-07 21:57:44,gxm38h,but lashes complete the look 😔
2738,2020-06-07 22:19:59,gxm38h,No... It's a guess at this point. No schedule has been given.
2739,2020-06-07 22:21:26,gxm38h,"According to the schedule, some time after 7pm"
2740,2020-06-07 22:21:54,gxm38h,"The description in the video says approximate timing is 7pm EST/4pm PST.

I just started watching the stream now so not sure if its actually following that schedule!"
2741,2020-06-07 23:05:38,gxm38h,You're making me feel old here XD
2742,2020-06-07 23:12:39,gxm38h,Cash Shit
2743,2020-06-07 23:20:29,gxm38h,Please I want Fire in there somewhere! Or Anpanman! But that’s my delulu brain. 😂
2744,2020-06-07 23:23:28,gxm38h,ON is almost guarenteed lol. I  think medley is fair considering they're the last act they'll be going out with a bang.....they might perform BWL but they've done so so many times in the US now so doubt 🤔.
2745,2020-06-07 23:31:50,gxm38h,Rhe most beautiful song the most beautiful dance. I may like this version specifically more than the digital one
2746,2020-06-07 23:41:18,gxm38h,"I noticed that too :P Made me wonder how many times they redid the song, makes sense they'd try to make each other laugh to make it more enjoyable :P"
2747,2020-06-07 23:38:36,gxm38h,They've had them for a while now I'm sure
2748,2020-06-07 23:43:43,gxm38h,"I noticed that, at first I was wondering if they'd swapped them around for the sake of it."
2749,2020-06-07 22:19:24,gxm38h,Sometimes a full beat is fun. Makes you feel powerful. Natural makeup is good too though.
2750,2020-06-07 23:11:59,gxm38h,I just shake it back at them.
2751,2020-06-07 20:18:20,gxm38h,"My mom finds her annoying, but I think she has really positive energy. Very chill as well."
2752,2020-06-07 20:18:34,gxm38h,lol! I do too! I love her as a singer and she has an amazing voice but not a big fan of her TV persona :)
2753,2020-06-07 21:12:37,gxm38h,"Each of them spoke and it was very touching, I would recommend just watching the video when you're able. It's uploaded to BangtanTV."
2754,2020-06-07 21:14:12,gxm38h,In what way?
2755,2020-06-07 21:45:24,gxm38h,SAME OMG
2756,2020-06-07 23:19:02,gxm38h,Mightt wanna think again.They mocked BTS by racially making fun of asians and the sound of korean language.
2757,2020-06-07 23:17:37,gxm38h,You’re right on time! BTS is next!
2758,2020-06-07 23:18:10,gxm38h,Nope! BTS is next to perform after CNCO (around in 10/15 mins I'm guessing)
2759,2020-06-07 23:18:09,gxm38h,NOPE!! The boys are next!!
2760,2020-06-07 23:18:35,gxm38h,Not for the performance
2761,2020-06-07 23:26:44,gxm38h,This is not the first time you watched the MV with me a year ago lmao 😂
2762,2020-06-07 23:39:42,gxm38h,"I want Jin's shirt from Mikrokosmos, too! But I'm betting it's far out of my price point haha"
2763,2020-06-07 21:54:02,gxm38h,A breakfast burrito. I was salivating the entire goddamn time.
2764,2020-06-07 23:25:00,gxm38h,CNCO are NOT Army!They made fun of BTS by mocking their korean language.
2765,2020-06-07 23:25:01,gxm38h,OH MY GOD.
2766,2020-06-07 22:18:27,gxm38h,"I do, they were both sweet"
2767,2020-06-07 22:23:38,gxm38h,"I mean, clearly people cares, if nobody cared they wouldn't have literally millions of subscribers"
2768,2020-06-07 22:29:50,gxm38h,"Don’t be such a negative nancy, people who don’t care about pop music/kpop could easily say the same about BTS. Bringing down others for their interests is always a dick move."
2769,2020-06-07 22:23:01,gxm38h,"While I’m sure your intent was not meant to be mean, Nikkie also had an important 2020 as she came out as trans due to a blackmail threat. So, I personally am glad that she was featured."
2770,2020-06-07 21:24:36,gxm38h,She was the victim of an assassination attempt for speaking out about female education: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malala_Yousafzai
2771,2020-06-07 21:23:36,gxm38h,She was shot in the head
2772,2020-06-07 20:36:34,gxm38h,Totally! We often feel so pressured to be the fastest and forget that everyone has their own speed.
2773,2020-06-07 23:43:45,gxm38h,😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
2774,2020-06-07 17:48:09,gxm38h,Oh NO I am so sorry. Have fun in Seoul tho!
2775,2020-06-07 21:35:29,gxm38h,"Haha seriously, I can only imagine watching some of these not being familiar with these people and thinking wtf 😂😂"
2776,2020-06-07 21:42:42,gxm38h,Or full grown adults for whom graduation is a fairly distant memory
2777,2020-06-07 23:21:27,gxm38h,Same

didn't realize how much i missed them until that first note of spring day came in and i just got goosebumps"
2787,2020-06-08 03:51:25,gxm38h,"I was smiling like a fool during Tae's parts. :D He looked so happy and really in his element throughout. :) And when he does, he stands out even more.

That said, all the boys did amazing <3 Everyone was in the zone and were in sync. Plus the harmonies in Spring Day and how they actually enjoyed BWL this time around!"
2788,2020-06-07 20:14:28,gxm38h,"You tuned in at a good time, I think they are actually meant to speak soon now lol!"
2789,2020-06-07 20:58:58,gxm38h,"It gives an impression of humility and good manners, though it's not bad manners to not do it!"
2790,2020-06-08 00:01:05,gxm38h,That exactly that. I believe it has the power the bring world peace or something equally as powerful as give a person hope.
2791,2020-06-07 23:57:36,gxm38h,Right?!
2792,2020-06-08 00:04:54,gxm38h,We won’t talk about the sandals.
2793,2020-06-08 00:02:48,gxm38h,I bet twitter is going crazy rn
2794,2020-06-07 20:35:47,gxm38h,Is this the new Carpool Karaoke? I think we're gonna see an even bigger influx of baby armys and I can't waaaait!!
2795,2020-06-07 20:35:03,gxm38h,Good!!!
2796,2020-06-07 20:17:59,gxm38h,RIGHT?It would be HILARIOUS if it wasn't actually true...
2797,2020-06-07 17:31:44,gxm38h,.... or watch the youtube countdown slowly ticking by.  haha. hope you get your stuff done in time!

2800,2020-06-08 00:07:30,gxm38h,Omg I didn’t even realize it was my cake day haha
2801,2020-06-08 00:18:34,gxm38h,"Time stamp 11:40 in the performance video, during their mikrokosmos performance."

2805,2020-06-07 20:08:56,gxm38h,"I hope that they do and that the others will get some time to speak in Korean and with subs to best convey their feelings.

I will also be happy with a full speech from Namjoon a la UN speech (which I definitely cried to when I was watching live)."

2811,2020-06-07 20:35:27,gxm38h,Just finished college and decided I wasn't ready for grad school yet. So I'm working on my TEFL certification and applying to teach English in either Korea or China. It's gonna be an adventure and I'm thrilled but wow. The closer it gets the scarier it gets too...
2812,2020-06-07 20:37:09,gxm38h,Thank you so much! I know it'll be great and such an adventure! There's nothing like leaping into the unknown and hoping for the best.

2817,2020-06-07 21:03:59,gxm38h,Sameeee. I haven't seen him in so long.
2818,2020-06-07 23:19:01,gxm38h,"Yup! I've applied to about 15 remote roles so far so I'm hopeful that they'll be following up this week. I've even tried applying to a remote role out of Ireland but it wouldn't let me because I'm in the US, hah!"
2819,2020-06-07 23:15:42,gxm38h,Oh me too!!! 😭

2823,2020-06-07 19:47:31,gxm38h,You can tell his voice apart a mile away. 💜
2824,2020-06-07 20:48:04,gxm38h,OMG I thought I was the only one...😅
2825,2020-06-07 21:45:38,gxm38h,"Agreed. I graduated a while ago, but if this was my graduation year I'd definitely be disappointed. But maybe that's just me."

2828,2020-06-07 23:53:40,gxm38h,"Lol you can see his sleeve during the performance of Spring Day, specifically towards the end of the song. Granted, I exaggerated a little (you don’t see the whole thing) but you definitely get a good look at it. I only vaguely recall it through my blurry eyes while I was busy crying lmao"
2829,2020-06-07 23:55:39,gxm38h,For like a hot second then they used a closed-sleeve shot right after

2831,2020-06-07 21:43:03,gxm38h,From hearing her speak and advocating these past few years she really seems to be someone who’s dedicated to doing and being better. Very admirable for me.
2832,2020-06-07 21:53:01,gxm38h,I left him a note after we both finished our final test in one of our classes. He never called. I wonder if it's still in the book he had on his desk.
2833,2020-06-07 21:56:54,gxm38h,You sure he wasn't getting inspiration from star wars? lol

2863,2020-06-08 00:01:31,gxm38h,"it was such a lost opportunity, wasn't it? they could have captivated muggles/non-army with the beautiful lyrics. also it would have given more context why they pointed at the sky during mikrokosmos etc. (so fitting, btw!)"

2870,2020-06-07 20:48:11,gxm38h,"Thank you all!

So, for example, i'm a physician. In my country you can only be a physician after studyng 7 years on a university, from wich 5 years are for the licentiate and then 2 years of practice for the professional dregree, so i have a licentiate on medicine and a professional title as a physician (technically ""physician surgeon"" but I don't think it's said like that in english). Then i can keep studying for 3 or 4 years to have a medical speciality or 3 years for a magister and then 5 for PhD.

Something similar on the US?"

I was watching the LY in New York DVD and when they were singing the mic drop remix RM sang his last line on his verse in Korean and I was like ""wait this line in the remix is an English one,did he confuse the versions or??"" So I found a fancam of the same show and RM rapped the remix english version and not the Korean one so BigHit dubbed the Korean line in the DVD for some reason."

I've watched too many BTS performances may it be on a concert, music show, tv shows etc. that I can often (not always!) discern if they are singing live or not. Imo they most likely sang live with backing track for BwL because of the choreo, but their team must have done something with the audio for the three songs to make it clear and loud in the video. Performing in a place like that will definitely affect how they sound.

Spring day was def live, it's easy to notice because of their facial expressions when they sang (I was also looking at their necks hehe)."

2967,2020-06-06 16:02:06,gxk6sh,"I'll start with this:  I think Moonlight is one of the greatest and most important works of American cinema in the last 20 years.  While CMBYN tops my ""best of the decade"" list in terms of purse personal enjoyment, Moonlight is a close second, and if I was an objective critic I'd probably give Moonlignt the top spot.  I was blown away when I saw it in 2016 and on every subsequent watch it has only improved.  

Since I wrote the questions it's pretty much all I could think of to talk about so I'm just going to run through some of them periodically, starting with #2.

>How do you think *Moonlight* speaks to the black experience in America today?

Being white myself, I can't really speak to its accuracy, but to me it feels like a really powerful representation of an under-represented--and all too common--experience many non-white Americans share.  And I think that alone is so important.  Representation matters.  When people in Holloywood see that a movie with an all black cast can win Best Picture, they realize that movies with non-white casts telling non-white stories can be successful, and those movies can finally get made and reach wider audiences.  And the more those movies get made the more normal it becomes, and that can only make the world a little bit less racist.

I think this movie also does something similar to CMBYN in the way it addresses racism (homophobia in CMBYN)--by not directly addressing it.  Neither movie makes a big show about these negative forces that put such a weight on the characters' shoulders.  CMBYN feels like this welcoming utopia where you are free to be yourself, but the closer you look, you notice the references to the era, politics, and religion, you catch the performative heterosexuality and the internalized homophobia.  Moonlight is this entirely black space and while addiction, abuse, poverty, violence, and yes, homophobia are pervasive, there is never overt racism because all the characters are black.  But racism is at the root of most if not all of those other problems--centuries of systemic racism designed to keep the black community poor and powerless.  And even though it is never confronted directly in the film, the fact that it is just accepted and unacknowledged as a fact of life by nearly all of the characters is a truly haunting and powerful statement.  Yes, Chiron's sexuality is more of the driving story of the film, but at its core it's a story about the black experience in America.  And it is absolutely a film everyone needs to be watching right now."
2968,2020-06-06 14:48:36,gxk6sh,"I watched this film twice: once by myself and again last night with my wife.  At the end of the film my wife said she had wasted 2 hours of her life, meaning she wasn't entertained. this  really shocked me because of the current protests over police brutality and the Black Lives matter movement and her concern  over the treatment of people of color. We began talking  and she said the movie was disturbing because it reminded her of her patients since she is a nurse working in a pediatric hospital in the northern section of Philadelphia.  She said,""I have taken care of children just like that who have mothers just like he did."" We are also the grandparents of 2 biracial kids and have had a conversation with their mother about, ""The talk,""which maybe a little premature and we all want to shelter them as long as possible.  The movie also forcefully represented Rev. Al Sharpton's assertion during his eulogy for George Floyd to the effect--We could have been the CEO's of your companies but your knee on our necks made us the drug dealers on the corner instead (paraphrase). And yes, there is the whole ""Am I a faggot?"" --""You'll  know when you know"" theme.  But his mother seemed to know when he was a boy of 9 or 10.  I can understand why this film won so many awards.  The acting, facial expressions, emotional outbursts, the pacing of the action (or lack of it)  seem to me to be more important than the dialogue."
2969,2020-06-06 18:15:46,gxk6sh,"I watched this movie a while ago and I'm not sure I'll get a chance to rewatch it this weekend, but here are my random thoughts about it.

I was impressed that this movie made the decision to make Juan be both Chiron's mentor and Chiron's mother's drug dealer. I feel like a lesser movie would have gone the less complex route and had Juan give up dealing, or take the noble stance of refusing to sell to Chiron's mother. But real life is complicated and messy and so are people, and the script doesn't run away from that.

The physical difference between the teenage and adult Chirons was striking enough that it took me a while to get used to the adult Chiron. I feel like maybe I missed some of the nuances of his performance because I was so busy trying to get used to the skinny teenager growing into a muscular man.

My husband watched the first several minutes of this, but was obviously anxious over it. He was afraid Juan was going to turn out to be a child molester. Even after I told him that didn't happen, he had to quit watching it because he has a hard time watching movies where bad things happen to kids.

Re: Oscar bait: On paper, I can see how Moonlight might look that way. ""He's black, and gay, and poor! Give us some Oscars so you can pat yourselves on the back for being sensitive and aware."" But the characters here are fully-developed people, and I think the movie deserved the Oscars it got. Definitely more deserving of Best Picture than the mediocre nonsense that was La-La Land.

The adult Kevin was one of the most captivating performances for me. You get the impression that seeing Chiron again is one of the best things to ever happen to him, and he's practically glowing the whole diner scene. Gotta say, though, I'm worried that being around Chiron is going to mess up Kevin's parole. I kind of wanted them to kiss again before the end of the movie, but it makes sense that they don't. Andre Holland is technically too old for the role of adult Kevin, but I forgot about that pretty fast.

Poor Chiron, never letting himself have an intimate relationship after Kevin. That was one of the most poignant parts of the movie for me.

The one thing that didn't quite ring true to me here was Juan being so accepting of gay people in the eighties. It's not that it would be impossible for him to have that attitude, but I felt like it would be unusual enough that I was curious to know why he was okay with gay people.

""Both films were written by gay men, but none of the actors are (openly) gay. Do you think this matters, and why?"" No. I don't think a lot of people have really thought out the implications of the whole ""gay parts should be played by gay actors"" mindset. For example, if the character is fifteen, are casting directors going to start quizzing a bunch of auditioning teenagers about their sexual orientations? If, say, Gay Actor X plays a gay character and then realizes a few years later that he's actually bisexual, does that somehow invalidate his performance?

It doesn't look like any writers or directors objected to straight actors in the parts. I think their ability to pick their cast is much more important than some ideological mandate that gay parts should be only for gay actors.

""What do you think the legacy of both films will be in 50 (or more) years?"" God, I've got no idea. I hope people still remember and watch them, though."
2970,2020-06-08 10:50:30,gxk6sh,"I just watched it. Beautiful film on so many levels, was very moved by it.
(Had to watch it while reading the script as I found the dialogue so hard to understand - tbh I am like this with many American movies)

The use of colour was so striking. That vivid blue coming through all the time, but pink (almost neon) too, as a counter to it. It has a luminous quality that reminded me of CMBYN, although the palette in the later was more based on green and somehow warmer. So many scenes were lush visually - Little's first car ride with Juan, the swimming scene, the diner....And the blue gas fire right at the end, has to be a metaphor....

I get a sense of foreboding from the colours in Moonlight that I don't in CMBYN - I was expecting an unhappy ending, so it was great that it ended so upbeat. 

Both cinematographers are masters of their art."
2971,2020-06-07 17:49:53,gxk6sh,"Sorry, the answers are random and hope it's okay.

Just finished the film. The cinematography is great and the actors are great but I'm not really sure why it won Best Picture. The film itself is scattered and it bores me. I'll choose La La Land. Don't get me wrong, I don't think La La Land is the best choice but at least it makes me cry at the end. I agree with those critics on “Oscar bait.” I don't think it would win Best Picture if it were about a gay white boy who sells drugs.

The last part of the film reminds me so much of CMBYN the book. The two guys actually forget nothing and one of them shows off his kid. As to queer sexuality, the kiss comes out of nowhere, and there's no sign Kevin is interested in Chiron. It's just so weird. It's also hard to believe Chiron is still a virgin and waits for his first love. He doesn't even seem to masturbate, so it makes me wonder if what they try to portray is asexual. The way CMBYN portrays queer sexuality is more real to me.

I'm not familiar with African American culture but I heard it's even harder for black males to accept gay people. It somehow shows in the film. Chiron is made fun of wearing tight jeans but he wears just like a white hipster to me. It may indicates white people are more flexible about the male clothing.

I don't think it matters that straight actors play gay roles. It's a boring debate. I love seeing gay actor play straight and straight actors play gay. They are actors and they play any roles different from themselves. I also read some reviews from queer people that attack CMBYN the book written by a straight author and the cast is all straight. They consider it as exploitation of gay story or something. It's just ridiculous how people can be so narrow-minded.

I think people will remember CMBYN in 50 years."
2972,2020-06-07 19:58:47,gxk6sh,">At the end of the film my wife said she had wasted 2 hours of her life, meaning she wasn't entertained. this  really shocked me because of the current protests over police brutality and the Black Lives matter movement and her concern  over the treatment of people of color.

She said,""I have taken care of children just like that who have mothers just like he did."" 

My mom is like this--she's a forensic psychologist and hates watching upsetting movies that remind her of work.  She's never seen Moonlight but she would probably hate it too.  And I can understand that--I watch a lot of heavy dramas but I don't have a problem with people who can't.  But now more than ever it feels like the right time to watch movies like Moonlight, movies that explore how systemic racism creates these unbreakable cycles of addiction, abuse, and poverty that that hurt generation after generation.

>The acting, facial expressions, emotional outbursts, the pacing of the action (or lack of it)  seem to me to be more important than the dialogue.

It is a beautifully acted film and it's a shame only Mahershala was (rightfully!) celebrated.  I think all 6 Chirons and Kevins are doing some pretty astounding work and the fact that they never met is crazy to me.  There is such a throughline between the three Chirons that links the initially very different-seeming characters--and that's exactly the point.  What Chiron goes through forces him to grow up quickly and become a certain kind of man, but at the core it's still him and it takes a bit of time in part 3 especually before we get to see that.  And that speaks to not just the performances but the direction and the writing as well."

Great point.  On the surface there is the plot reason for it--with Chiron becoming a dealer himself because he is taking after his father figure--but it also speaks to the complications of life.  Sometimes people in your life can be both a good and a bad influence.  Sometimes someone can have a profoundly positive impact on your life and you only realize as an adult that there were bad things too.  Juan was undoubtedly formative and very important for Chiron, but if his father figure wasn't a drug dealer, would he perhaps have ""escaped"" like Kevin did?  (Though of course Kevin only escaped after serving prison time himself--and that is an entirely separate issue, the mass incarceration of black men in America.)

>The physical difference between the teenage and adult Chirons was striking enough that it took me a while to get used to the adult Chiron. I feel like maybe I missed some of the nuances of his performance because I was so busy trying to get used to the skinny teenager growing into a muscular man.

The first time I watched it I kind of had whiplash from the insane transformation, but I think it serves a very effective purpose.  Chiron didn't want to be that skinny, weak kid anymore.  And don't forget, he'd been to prison as well.  And on the whole I think it's sad.  His whole look and attitude--until the final scene--is so performative, either because he doesn't want to be or feels he *can't* be himself.  It's exactly what Kevin says ""I ain't seen you in a minute, it's not exactly what I expected.""  There's a reason we hear ""Who is you Chiron?"" multiple times in the film--I think we're supposed to he asking the same question.

>My husband watched the first several minutes of this, but was obviously anxious over it. He was afraid Juan was going to turn out to be a child molester. 

I felt the same way, and I think we're probably meant to.  It's kind of sad, but that's what the world is.

>Re: Oscar bait: On paper, I can see how Moonlight might look that way. ""He's black, and gay, and poor! Give us some Oscars so you can pat yourselves on the back for being sensitive and aware."" But the characters here are fully-developed people, and I think the movie deserved the Oscars it got. Definitely more deserving of Best Picture than the mediocre nonsense that was La-La Land.

Totally agree.  Also people who throw around terms like ""Oscar bait"" clearly don't know that the Oscars really don't love movies about non-white people.  Sure, they love tragedy and suffering but they much prefer it in the form of a straight, white man overcoming some tragedy or trauma to become Great.

>The adult Kevin was one of the most captivating performances for me. You get the impression that seeing Chiron again is one of the best things to ever happen to him, and he's practically glowing the whole diner scene. 

Completely agree.  Honestly all the performers in this movie are top notch but Andre Holland and Trevante Rhodes are giving so much.  I thinking seeing Kevin become this person is just as jarring as seeing bulked up Chiron, and leaves you with so many questions (in a good way).  

>I kind of wanted them to kiss again before the end of the movie, but it makes sense that they don't.

Same.  I wanted it for Chiron, but it wasn't what he needed--he needed comfort and safety and support.  And Kevin was able to give that to him.

>Poor Chiron, never letting himself have an intimate relationship after Kevin. That was one of the most poignant parts of the movie for me.

It's heartbreaking.  This is for me one of those movies where the whole thing is very good and you're enjoying it and then you get to the last scene and it's so phenomenal that the entire thing just coalesces and becomes something different and so much more.  It's how I felt watching Weekend and And Then We Danced, both of which I watched recently.    On the Waterfront--my favorite film of all time--is another one like that.

>The one thing that didn't quite ring true to me here was Juan being so accepting of gay people in the eighties. It's not that it would be impossible for him to have that attitude, but I felt like it would be unusual enough that I was curious to know why he was okay with gay people.

Hmm, interesting.  I kind of always just accepted it--even if it may have been unusual--because a) even in very homophobic times and places there have always been allies and tolerant people, and b) Theresa is clearly a good influence.  I think it's also interesting that each segment of the movie kind of feels timeless.  Like, unless part 3 is set in the future it has to be the 80s, but there's nothing really explicitly making the setting obvious.  All three of the settings feel relatively timeless (except Chiron's phone in part 3) and I think that works really well.

>I don't think a lot of people have really thought out the implications of the whole ""gay parts should be played by gay actors"" mindset. For example, if the character is fifteen, are casting directors going to start quizzing a bunch of auditioning teenagers about their sexual orientations? If, say, Gay Actor X plays a gay character and then realizes a few years later that he's actually bisexual, does that somehow invalidate his performance?

Very good points.  While I wholeheartedly support more roles for queer actors I do still believe in hiring the best person for the job.*  All 8 leads between these two movies are giving incredible performances and I don't think they should've been ineligible because they are straight.  

*I do think that franchises like Disney or Marvel should make an effort to cast queer actors in queer roles though.  Not only is this sending an important message through a massive megaphone, but these kind of movies do not live or die on performance--they don't need to be casting the best person for the job, regardless of sexuality.

>God, I've got no idea. I hope people still remember and watch them, though.

I think they both will be remembered for a while.  Obviously Moonlight will be remembered as a Best Picture winner, but I see it being remembered far longer than The Shape of Water and (ugh) Green Book.  I think it has the right combination of being a skillfully crafted and entertaining film that also had a very pertinent message--much like Get Out the following year.  I don't know if CMBYN will be remembered for the same reason because there are ""lots"" of very good queer films coming out now, but I think a) it already has a cult following, and b) it will be remembered as the movie that launched Timothée Chalamet'd career, and I truly believe he is going to be a Brando-level actor."

> Janelle Monáe (born Janelle Monáe Robinson on December 1, 1985 in Kansas City, Kansas) is an American singer, songwriter, dancer, producer, actor and performer.

>  She moved to New York to study theatre at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy. Her original plan was to pursue a career on Broadway, but she soon changed her mind and returned to music. After moving to Atlanta, Georgia in 2003,  Monáe founded the Wondaland Arts Society with like-minded young artists, and made a couple of appearances on OutKast's 2006 album Idlewild, where she is featured on the songs ""Call the Law"" and ""In Your Dreams"".

> By 2007, Monáe was ready to release her first solo work, titled Metropolis. It was originally conceived as a concept album in four parts, or suites, which were to be released through her website and mp3 download sites. After the release of the first part of the series, Metropolis Suite I of IV: The Chase in mid-2007, these plans were altered following her signing with Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' label, Bad Boy Records, later in the year. The label gave an official and physical release to the first suite in August 2008, which was retitled Metropolis: The Chase Suite (Special Edition) and included two new tracks. The EP was generally well-received by critics, gaining Monáe a 2009 Grammy nomination in the Best Urban/Alternative Performance for her single ""Many Moons"", festival appearances, and opening slots for the indie pop band Of Montreal. Monáe also toured as the opening act for band No Doubt on their summer 2009 tour.

>  In a November 2009 interview, Monáe revealed the title and concept behind her album The ArchAndroid. The second and third suites of Metropolis are combined into this full-length release, in which Monáe's alter-ego, Cindi Mayweather - also the protagonist of Metropolis: The Chase Suite - becomes a messiah-like figure to the android community of Metropolis.

**Rihanna - Umbrella** (the LSFYL songs for season premieres are usually by a big name artist and All Stars premieres usually have one of their signature songs, e.g. Taylor Swift - Shake It Off, Nicki Minaj - Anaconda, Mariah Carey - Emotions)

**Carly Rae Jepsen - Higher** (Episode 2/3 of All Stars usually have a recent pop songstress' fan favorite hit—Lorde - Green Light, Ariana Grande - Into You, Lizzo - Juice—with the exception of AS2)

**Madonna - Papa Don't Preach** (Episode 2/3 also has the trend of an 80s song as the LSFYL, with Taylor Dayne, The Pointer Sisters twice, and Whitney Houston being the artists)

**Kelly Clarkson - Since U Been Gone** (Episode 4 doesn't really have anything in common in terms of LSFYL songs except that maybe they are sung by divas—Katy, Tina, Rih. Although one could say that most of the songs are sung by divas. I put Kelly cause she deserves and so does this song).

**The Divinyls - I Touch Myself** (Not determining the song by the episode number but by the number of girls left—which is the Top 6—top 6 episode usually have a throwback as a song like The Boss, Come Rain or Shine, Cherry Bomb, Open Your Heart.)

**David Bowie - Let's Dance** (Comeback episodes specifically don't have a theme in lip syncs—we've had Rihanna, Deborah Cox, four RuPauls. Two Top 5 episodes however have had male lip syncs—both of which are RuPaul, AS2 and 3's unfortunately. This song + the situation if someone coming back might up the ante and the intensity of the lip sync and also we might actually get some gravity defying moves.)

**Dolly Parton - 9 to 5/Kacey Musgraves - High Horse** (Looking at the episodes before the finale, we've had two RuPaul songs, a Janet song, and a Reba song. So in conclusion, gay. I'd like to continue going with the country theme going and have two options: one tk finally give Dolly the recognition she deserves and to compensate that we didn't get a Kacey lip sync yet and a modern song hasn't been done in a while)

**Whitney Houston - I Wanna Dance With Somebody** (Finale lip syncs for All Stars: If You Were My Woman, Wrecking Ball, Fighter, Make Me Feel. This last lip sync should sonically be climactic, matching the season's end. And what better than the climax of all climaxes?)

Some other random songs tho: King Princess - Hit the Back, Nelly Furtado - Maneater, Jocelyn Brown - Somebody Else's Guy."

3048,2020-08-18 12:57:04,ibukid,"**Sia - ""The Greatest""** - The first episode usually has a big name song to start with. I thought of going with ""Chandelier"", but ""The Greatest"" was explicitly made for the LGBT+ community, so it fits

**Studio Killers - ""Eros And Apollo""** - Or anything by them really. They've started having more songs sung by male artists, and I think that ANY of their songs would make fantastic lip syncs. I probably should have picked ""Jenny"" since it's their most well known song (and honestly the only song most people know by them) but it's not like this list is ACTUALLY gonna happen, so.

**Caravan Palace - ""Lone Digger""** - It's a song that's on the cusp of being popular, but not quite, with a lot of people having heard the song but not knowing the name. Has the potential to be a great lip sync if the girls learn the words.

**Sara Bareilles - ""Brave""** - Something a bit slower tempo whilst not being a straight up ballad, and honestly surprised they've not had a Sara Bareilles song yet. Would vibe great with LGBT kids.

**Lauren Aquilina - ""Psycho""** - Yeah I know you've not heard of her, but look up the song and TRY to tell me it's not a perfect LSFYL song.

**Alanis Morisette - ""You Oughta Know""** - Partly because my list was feeling a bit too ""modern music only"", partly because everyone knows Alanis, but Ironic is an objectively worse LSFYL song than you Oughta Know.

**Evanescence - ""Going Under""** - Because come ON.

**Gin Wigmore - ""Black Sheep""** - Yeah another artist you've not heard of but this is my list so I don't care. 90% of Gin's songs are bangers and honestly you could fill the entirety of a AS series with only Gin songs, but I have to pick one, and Black Sheep is a bop that I feel would resonate with a lot of angry gays."
3049,2020-08-18 05:16:20,ibukid,This is amazing... Asia getting her Valentina redemption moment with TPP and Kennedy getting her’s too with Hot Stuff!
3050,2020-08-19 13:00:18,ibukid,"There are few times on this subreddit I actually completely agree with every single song someone suggests, as there's always a few suggestions where I'm like, 'really queen, that song would be underwhelming as hell or too slow or w/e', but all 8 of yours picks not only are exactly the kind of style that the show picks, but also all of them are fantastic and uncommon choices are, so thank you for the top suggestions here be different than the same tired answers. We get it, ya'll want Kate Bush songs on Drag Race, it ain't gonna happen and it wouldn't be as epic as ya'll overhype it up to be. 
Brava."
3051,2020-08-18 15:56:20,ibukid,"Or a monster ball redo, with Close Your Eyes as the lipsync song."
3052,2020-08-18 11:31:01,ibukid,I like your reasoning bwhind the choices ²⁰²⁰
3053,2020-08-18 12:13:51,ibukid,You have really cracked the code sis.
3054,2020-08-18 12:11:00,ibukid,Haven’t we had Nasty twice already? I think Kameron’s performance suffices for one life time
3055,2020-08-18 12:12:54,ibukid,I think You Should See Me in a Crown would bring out a better performance if we’re going to get a Billie lipsync. It’s upbeat enough considering.
3056,2020-08-18 13:41:08,ibukid,Yessss dim all the lights and also I would die for some Kate Bush
3057,2020-08-18 05:12:38,ibukid,"Yea I doubt there’ll ever be a bey song lip-synced, but in my mind, Asia and Sonique are lip-syncing to it rn!"
3058,2020-08-18 07:22:08,ibukid,"I never thought I'd see anyone suggesting Lunachicks on this sub, but I'd argue Don't Want You would be a better choice"
3059,2020-08-18 11:27:43,ibukid,"Plan B songs:

Frankie goes to Hollywood - Relax


Kelis - Trick Me


Rihanna - Don't stop the Music


Ava Max - Torn


Sylvester - Do you wanna funk!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


Kelly Rowland - Commander (I feel like it's gonna be on S13)


Lady Gaga - Alice/Babylon/Sourcandy


Blackpink - Dudu-ddu-du


Kylie Minogue - Can't get you out of my head/ In your eyes (even though a US season doesn't deserve Kylie so perhaps UK S2)


Cher- Steong Enough"
3060,2020-08-18 16:36:20,ibukid,Gurl did you copy paste my playlist? I would live for Lone Digger or Eros and Apollo - I'm dancing to it every single night
3061,2020-08-18 14:51:27,ibukid,"I don’t want to spoil anything, but one of your songs is rumoured to soon be a lipsync on Drag Race Canada :)"
3062,2020-08-19 16:27:29,ibukid,Omg thank you! 💜
3063,2020-08-18 12:11:50,ibukid,Right!!!! I was listening to Nasty and totally didn’t think while writing. I meant Rhytm Nation!
3064,2020-08-18 12:39:34,ibukid,"I can't remember much of the album to be honest, I just remember really loving Bad Guy. Need to give the album another listen because I remember it being great."
3065,2020-08-18 15:13:07,ibukid,Dim All The Lights should have been Kennedy's lip sync assassin song.
3066,2020-08-18 10:49:36,ibukid,Of course in your mind they are lipsyncing to it. They are lipsyncing every week together after all till the finale
3067,2020-08-18 15:12:14,ibukid,"Oooh! Honestly when I made it I thought Alanis would be more likely to be on Canada than All Stars, so I'm GUESSING it's that.

But wow, any of these songs being on there would be awesome."

3070,2020-08-17 16:58:17,ibhsnr,Feel like the Frank vs. Fiona matchup is gonna be insanely close
3071,2020-08-17 17:19:26,ibhsnr,"Wow, RIP *High Violet*"
3072,2020-08-17 16:52:17,ibhsnr,My disbelief and disappointment on Have One on Me losing to Congratulations is immense and immeasurable.
3073,2020-08-17 18:15:15,ibhsnr,MBDTF vs Suburbs is a hell of a matchup.
3074,2020-08-17 17:53:45,ibhsnr,2010 bracket is over all of a sudden and Janelle and Joanna won? Omg what an interesting turn of events
3075,2020-08-17 19:37:43,ibhsnr,"lol, all this voting just to have seeds 1-4 in the winners bracket and seeds 5-11 & 13 in the losers bracket.

The starting seeds were surprisingly accurate."
3076,2020-08-17 18:29:52,ibhsnr,"I have cooled on my Tame worship over the past 3 years, but I will never not vote for Lonerism."
3077,2020-08-17 17:10:10,ibhsnr,"The Beach House stanning on this sub is out of control. First they beat Have One On Me, then Have You In My Wilderness. Not even The National (who have had a well-deserved strong run in this tournament) could beat them. What will it take for them to lose?"
3078,2020-08-17 17:17:30,ibhsnr,Expecting and hoping that GKMC wins but Lonerism or Bloom could probably stage an upset. Also voted Money Store over Bloom but it’s a pretty futile cause.
3079,2020-08-17 17:01:43,ibhsnr,"Only votes I got today are Lonerism over Visions and The Money Store over Bloom. Latter one sucks, because I think Bloom is my favorite of Beach House's albums, but The Money Store is much more interesting an album."
3080,2020-08-17 21:21:52,ibhsnr,"Ugh, I know 2 doesn't stand a chance against Kendrick, but 2 really got me through a weird period in my life, and I owe it a lot."
3081,2020-08-17 23:28:21,ibhsnr,how TF is anyone supposed to choose between 2 by mac and good kid mad city
3082,2020-08-17 18:22:16,ibhsnr,Let's go Frank! (and Grimes!)
3083,2020-08-17 22:22:42,ibhsnr,Congratulations is still alive!! :)
3084,2020-08-18 04:41:04,ibhsnr,Attack on Memory about to lose to fucking Swing Lo Magellan in the losers bracket? This is the most disconnected I've ever felt from this sub
3085,2020-08-17 17:03:41,ibhsnr,Really hoping Channel Orange will win this year. Both Channel Orange and Blonde are probably in my top 10 of the decade. I think Channel Orange is his best album and deserves to win this year.
3086,2020-08-17 18:28:30,ibhsnr,Straight chalk in the winners' bracket leggo
3087,2020-08-17 18:43:56,ibhsnr,Did anybody else pick their top four weeks ago? How are you? So far I’m doing alright.
3088,2020-08-17 20:25:22,ibhsnr,"I just saw Angles still in the 2011 bracket. will it win? probably not, but now I got my hopes up somehow."
3089,2020-08-17 21:19:16,ibhsnr,surprised Celebration Rock isn't destroying Fear Fun
3090,2020-08-18 02:15:13,ibhsnr,Bloom vs The Money Store is simply
3091,2020-08-18 09:28:18,ibhsnr,So happy to check back this morning and see that Dirty Projectors and Parquet Courts have both turned it around and are now slightly ahead.
3092,2020-08-17 23:19:28,ibhsnr,I like beach house and I like bloom but there is no way it should be beating the money store. A travesty.
3093,2020-08-17 18:17:41,ibhsnr,"do you think this would have been the case a couple years ago? i think there's been a gradual increase in respect for fiona apple's discography over the last couple of years and the release of *fetch the bolt cutters* really seems to have brought her more listeners. i'm not sure i would have expected this matchup to be close any time besides this year, but better late than never"
3094,2020-08-17 18:37:57,ibhsnr,"Fiona is currently down 52-48, let's push her over the top, people!"
3095,2020-08-17 22:46:43,ibhsnr,Thought about reporting this to the mods because making me choose between Frank and Fiona feels like a homophobic attack tbh.
3096,2020-08-17 20:15:22,ibhsnr,Channel Orange is an awesome album but its really no contest imo.
3097,2020-08-18 11:04:54,ibhsnr,You're surprised by a two hour folk album with a singing style that needs getting used to losing to a entry level psychedelic pop album that's been a favourite on this subreddit for years?
3098,2020-08-17 17:02:27,ibhsnr,It's an absolute travesty. This is how you treat the AOTD? You couldn't even let it win against a MGMT album. Embarrassing.
3099,2020-08-17 21:21:37,ibhsnr,Joanna is really just getting stung by not being on Spotify imo
3100,2020-08-17 17:47:38,ibhsnr,But is your day ruined?
3101,2020-08-17 21:23:19,ibhsnr,Hi guys. lol
3102,2020-08-17 17:01:17,ibhsnr,The only explanation I can find for that is that it's 2020
3103,2020-08-17 20:17:31,ibhsnr,The only explanation is way more people have listened to Congratulations. Its the only thing that keeps me going.
3104,2020-08-17 17:51:45,ibhsnr,"i agree it seems out of control but i guess it shows how consistent the band is and how divided people are when it comes to choosing which of the groups 2010s albums is their best. *teen dream* is (unfortunately) that album for me, but i know there are others who feel that about *bloom* or *depression cherry*. the strong performance of their albums is probably a good argument in favor of limiting the number of submissions a band can have in one of these tournaments. but, it's also probably an indicator that they might be the ""best"" or at least most consistently loved indie band of the 2010s"
3105,2020-08-18 13:06:13,ibhsnr,"I feel similar, I love 2 and for me it's a perfect album in the sense that nothing could be added to or taken away from it that would make it better. Like, I get why it's getting pummelled, but scale of ambition is so different between the two albums that it feels almost unfair to compare them – almost like a featherweight being put in the ring with a super heavyweight."
3106,2020-08-17 23:10:18,ibhsnr,hey ur shadowbanned so you probably want to make a new account or something
3107,2020-08-17 20:16:42,ibhsnr,But its up against Idler Wheel man.
3108,2020-08-17 19:04:03,ibhsnr,"Definitely not as close, Fiona’s been big here but her relevance is at an all time high compared to frank especially"
3109,2020-08-17 17:05:22,ibhsnr,"Thats the worst fucking part, first it should have never been in the losers bracket (in top 5 of decade easily) so quickly and then losing against MGMT. I am pissed!"
3110,2020-08-17 23:06:30,ibhsnr,"Reminds me of the 2018 AotY tournament, where MGMT's LDA somehow defeated three much better albums in a row (Daughters, Pusha T, Julia Holter) to make the finals. Leave it to MGMT to return and disappoint again."
3111,2020-08-17 17:03:39,ibhsnr,yeah that checks out..
3112,2020-08-18 08:15:49,ibhsnr,Or people prefer quality instrumentals to ok singing. People here are blinded by an unexplainable MGMT hate.
3113,2020-08-17 18:50:16,ibhsnr,Bloom gang
3114,2020-08-17 19:14:05,ibhsnr,oh yeah i think the fact that *blonde* seems to have officially overshadowed *channel orange* helps fiona in this matchup but didn't even consider how the hype around frank might be different if he also had a new album out to compete with fiona in 2020
3115,2020-08-17 17:17:41,ibhsnr,The complete disrespect shown against Joanna in this tournament is very disappointing. Divers didn't get the love it deserved either.
3116,2020-08-17 19:15:33,ibhsnr,Now THAT would be a crazy competition
3117,2020-08-13 12:36:24,i8q1l0,brilliant! what's the story behind these?
3118,2020-08-13 02:45:46,i8q1l0,"this is fantastic, wow"

3173,2020-07-31 20:44:14,i1do9g,"It’s not horrible though. This won’t effect tenets release and tenet will surely reopen every theater that legally can. It might push the opening date back a week or two, but at least for the chains the plan was always to open a few weeks before tenet anyways to get the crew trained centered before the big one."

3176,2020-08-01 03:02:15,i1dn86,So that means New Mutants is the next scheduled movie to hit theaters. /u/danmurrell it happened!
3177,2020-08-02 02:17:01,i1dn86,That’s too bad. This looked amazing and brave

3184,2020-07-30 03:09:10,i09pdf,this is wholesome somehow. somethin to dü
3185,2020-07-29 19:05:27,i0662m,Not Shea lipsyncing to make me feel 👁️👄👁️
3186,2020-07-29 19:06:25,i0662m,The best part is that the song was requested before the finale aired XD
3187,2020-07-29 07:51:36,hztg5q,"IKR?! I WALKED IN ON MY DAD WATCHING IT AND I WAS LIKE ""IS THAT JANELLE MONÁE?"" AND HE WAS LIKE ""yeah..."" and then we watched the entire season together. Thank you for listening to my TedTalk."
3188,2020-07-27 15:35:49,hyshcb,Ugh I’m obsessed with her.
3189,2020-07-27 15:34:37,hyshcb,She’s so flipping gorgeous! Love love love her!
3190,2020-07-27 16:10:53,hyshcb,I would absolutely worship at the temple of Janelle Monáe.
3191,2020-07-27 16:42:53,hyshcb,"Probably the sexiest woman, like, ever?"
3192,2020-07-27 13:48:45,hyshcb,she gonna spill her drink like that
3193,2020-07-27 16:47:43,hyshcb,Tessa Thompson is BEYOND lucky! Even if they’re not a thing anymore she lived the dream.
3194,2020-07-27 16:20:36,hyshcb,Does that floaty take up 90% of the pool?
3195,2020-07-27 15:52:32,hyshcb,Good lord 🔥🔥🔥
3196,2020-07-27 17:35:48,hyshcb,An I will save that for later 😍

3198,2020-07-27 14:34:31,hyshcb,I want to ride that floaty in the pool with her ;)
3199,2020-07-27 16:30:13,hyshcb,Really dig the floaty.
3200,2020-07-27 19:05:06,hyshcb,goddessssssss

3203,2020-07-27 22:58:08,hyshcb,She's so effortlessly cool.
3204,2020-07-28 04:05:21,hyshcb,"If you haven’t seen her in Homecoming season 2, i recommend you do so immediately"
3205,2020-07-27 17:22:45,hyshcb,cant masturbate when i'm so worried about her accidentally spilling some of that drink into the pool
3206,2020-07-27 20:49:37,hyshcb,She's hot!
3207,2020-07-30 23:54:36,hyshcb,[deleted]
3208,2020-07-27 23:33:51,hyshcb,Also super talented - if you’ve seen her performance on Austin city limits then you’ve been blessed🙏🏾💫👌
3209,2020-07-28 03:09:47,hyshcb,"I find her over-made to the point of distraction, but to each their own."
3210,2020-07-28 00:33:16,hyshcb,Drink?  What drink?  I didn't even notice it!
3211,2020-07-27 23:33:14,hyshcb,If I could be a fly on the wall when they are/we’re together 🥰🥰🥰 damn they are a cute couple😎👌

3215,2020-07-28 01:36:42,hyshcb,I’d be happy with being their plaything.
3216,2020-07-26 20:01:00,hydlmk,She changed her avi too so this could very well be a new era. I’m screaming.
3217,2020-07-26 20:09:38,hydlmk,"Suite VI Suite VI Suite VI 

SUITE VI SUITE VI SUITE VI"
3218,2020-07-26 20:15:31,hydlmk,"Could you imagine a political Janelle drop right now, LITERALLY getting chills just thinking about it, manifesting ✨"
3219,2020-07-26 21:09:59,hydlmk,I'm really skeptical this is an album cover but it may be very well be a new promo photo
3220,2020-07-26 20:06:22,hydlmk,"her too?? what did we do to deserve so much good music this year

edit: but tbh i don't like the cover i can't tell if it's cause of the editing or those lights"
3221,2020-07-26 19:59:50,hydlmk,Janelle “Ellie” Monae
3222,2020-07-26 20:20:43,hydlmk,"She was teasing a lot of Halloween not being over for her, so maybe a lead now and the album in October? Dirty Computer was more about her so maybe she wants to go back to Cindi now?"
3223,2020-07-26 21:22:46,hydlmk,It looked zoomed-in. I bet there’s 90% more to this photo.

3225,2020-07-26 22:00:47,hydlmk,Ma’am On The Moon
3226,2020-07-26 22:12:59,hydlmk, u/Janellemonae new album?
3227,2020-07-26 19:59:22,hydlmk,"oh the serve is off the CHARTS here

maybe 2020 isn't so bad at all"
3228,2020-07-26 20:43:22,hydlmk,"God I hope so. The rest of the year is mostly one big question mark in terms of upcoming releases, hopefully we'll get some new albums announced soon."
3229,2020-07-26 22:52:18,hydlmk,OH MY GOD! I swear this reminds me of a dream I had a few months ago where Janelle released an album with an underwater aesthetic and she was wearing a diving helmet. I'll just about die if the second half of the year really has something from her.
3230,2020-07-26 20:52:41,hydlmk,I hope all this excitement remains when it’s time to BUY THE ALBUM 👀
3231,2020-07-26 21:07:38,hydlmk,"i wouldn’t think she would want to promote an album rn with antebellum being released in a month but i will GLADLY be proven wrong, step on us some more queen"
3232,2020-07-26 22:21:06,hydlmk,"I didn't expect another album from her so soon, but if this turns out to be true then AOTY incoming!"
3233,2020-07-26 21:02:59,hydlmk,"I know she has been super into the acting part of her career lately, but now that covid has brought the industry to a halt... PLEASE let this be music related"
3234,2020-07-26 23:03:19,hydlmk,I know this is an old photo but I hope this is her hinting at a return to the Cindi Mayweather story 😭 she left us hanging with Dirty Computer and I really hope she finishes the story and then turns it into a musical on Broadway
3235,2020-07-26 23:29:21,hydlmk,If she drops anything 2020 automatically becomes the best year for music in modern history
3236,2020-07-27 05:16:23,hydlmk,Really hope that she is in the process of it. I know she isn't really mainstream but I still hope it is possible. Remember she has a #1 hit under her belt already.
3237,2020-07-26 20:22:56,hydlmk,Oh this colour palette
3238,2020-07-26 21:03:38,hydlmk,Omg yes I’m literally listening to her albums right now
3239,2020-07-26 21:54:17,hydlmk,"It doesn't look like a cover to me, but it could be the behind the scenes of a new album cover. Now, if that's the album name I'm here for it!"
3240,2020-07-26 22:53:37,hydlmk,How come everyone is releasing now???? I would like Ariana to jump on this trend 👀
3241,2020-07-26 23:54:18,hydlmk,/u/janellemonae did Shea’s lip sync to Make Me Feel make you decide you needed to make even MORE amazing music?
3242,2020-07-26 22:11:40,hydlmk,Ok wait I'm gonna scream
3243,2020-07-26 23:01:56,hydlmk,Django Jane save us
3244,2020-07-27 12:13:28,hydlmk,Lol I've had this as profile picture since I created this account. I doubt it's an album cover.
3245,2020-07-26 20:02:31,hydlmk,OH????
3246,2020-07-26 20:04:27,hydlmk,Cool album name
3247,2020-07-26 20:20:34,hydlmk,Queen Janelle following the steps of Xtina and DAOKO.
3248,2020-07-26 20:38:00,hydlmk,Dropping this little hint after she was the final lip sync on all stars 5. Her mind
3249,2020-07-26 23:08:24,hydlmk,Lol I doubt that’d be the album cover.
3250,2020-07-26 23:37:40,hydlmk,OMG come through!!!
3251,2020-07-27 00:55:51,hydlmk,To space we go.
3252,2020-07-27 01:05:08,hydlmk,I was wondering not too long ago when she was going to release a new album. I'm so ready for new music from her!
3253,2020-07-27 01:13:10,hydlmk,Seems like a VERY quick album cycle for her! She usually sits on new stuff for awhile. Here’s to hoping!!!
3254,2020-07-27 02:07:17,hydlmk,pretty!
3255,2020-07-27 04:37:06,hydlmk,I’m pretty sure this is a fan-edit that’s been around for a while. I used to have this or something very similar to it as my lockscreen.
3256,2020-07-27 15:08:06,hydlmk,We need her

3258,2020-07-26 20:32:55,hydlmk,The way you guys let pynk and queen and yoga  flop. Smh

3260,2020-07-27 16:01:28,hydlmk,"It's an old photo from her American Way shoot, unfortunately :("
3261,2020-07-26 21:23:46,hydlmk,YES PLEASE. SHE'S COMING TO SAVE 2020
3262,2020-07-27 19:04:18,hydlmk,"If I could, i'd put get on my ballot."
3263,2020-07-26 21:17:59,hydlmk,Yeah to me it doesn’t look too album coverish to me. She looks GREAT but it’s too simple I guess to be an album cover imo. But could totally be completely wrong
3264,2020-07-27 04:24:26,hydlmk,"Definitely not an album cover. Janelle is in the 2020 NASA astronaut class, and this is her portrait"
3265,2020-07-27 16:01:48,hydlmk,"It's not unfortunately, it's from her American Way shoot :("
3266,2020-07-26 20:10:41,hydlmk,same I'm hoping its just promo😭

3271,2020-07-26 21:12:23,hydlmk,I think it would actually suit her perfectly because she can promote both at the same time.
3272,2020-07-27 03:10:31,hydlmk,"And also...is Antebellum going to actually release then? Who knows? And if the album is like Oct, that timeline seems to make sense for me."
3273,2020-07-27 03:12:17,hydlmk,2.5 years? Now that DC and movies made her so much of a star? That doesn't seem crazy to me.
3274,2020-07-27 01:06:25,hydlmk,She wasn’t in Fences tho?
3275,2020-07-26 22:24:35,hydlmk,"Unfortunately, Popheads doesn't control the Hot 100. If that were the case, Run Away With Me would have been a multiple-weeks-at-#1 smasher and Lady Gaga would be dominating the charts right now."

3281,2020-07-26 09:35:45,hxwkq0,Holy moly - this is so uncannily close that I wonder if Brennan used this song when he was writing those last elements of her backstory - “I was made to believe there’s something wrong with me and it *hurts my heart* is a perfect description of the convent abuse scene!

3341,2020-07-23 02:05:02,hw0n62,"Artpop is the reason why pop is around today. The song 'Applause' invented a style of visual and auditory communication of clapping, a movement when one slaps their palms together to create sound. This revolutionised the concert experience starting from 'Artpop ball' in 2013/14."
3342,2020-07-27 13:03:44,hw0n62,Wouldn't have flopped if it was Artdisco
3343,2020-07-21 23:43:31,hvi9na,Shoutout to the one person who voted for Trolls.
3344,2020-07-22 01:01:04,hvi9na,"Damn...I love La La Land, but this is one case where I definitely think the Academy got it right. But still La La Land is a great movie

Very glad all the acting awards stayed the same. From a wins perspective, this was a good year for the Academy"
3345,2020-07-22 00:29:00,hvi9na,Jungle book should've won visual effects imo :/
3346,2020-07-22 01:19:59,hvi9na,The Academy has one up on Reddit!
3347,2020-07-21 23:17:19,hvi9na,"Films with multiple wins:

La La Land – 11

Moonlight – 3

Arrival, The Handmaiden, Manchester by the Sea, and Zootopia – 2"
3348,2020-07-22 02:29:54,hvi9na,OJ lost 😭😭😭
3349,2020-07-21 23:36:03,hvi9na,"Well...damn. At least some of the races were close I guess 

Early FYC for tomorrow: James McAvoy in Split for best actor, and Logan for whatever you feel like voting it for (you missed Patrick Stewart in Supporting this year, make up for it next year). Also The Death Of Stalin (if that’s eligible next year I don’t remember how the eligibility will work for that)"
3350,2020-07-21 23:41:15,hvi9na,"Dang, 4 categories went 1. La La Land 2. Moonlight 3. Arrival. I would’ve liked to see Arrival switched with La La Land in all of those, and I really wish Moonlight won best picture."
3351,2020-07-22 06:21:30,hvi9na,"Man Star Trek Beyond lost once again. And it still didn't even beat Suicide Squad. 

Also disappointed that both Rogue One and Jungle Book got so few votes in the vfx category. With Rogue One I understand that the cgi Tarkin probably wasn't everyone's favourite, but how Jungle Book come in only third. I thought it was rightful winner that year."
3352,2020-07-22 01:50:16,hvi9na,"I wish Moonlight kept its win but oh well.

I’m glad Stone kept her Oscar.

I’m not sure how Arrival won VFX of Doctor Strange and The Jungle Book, but okay.

I think 2017 will be: Logan, Lady Bird, Dunkirk, **Get Out**, Call Me by Your Name, The Shape of Water, Blade Runner 2049, Phantom Thread, The Florida Project, and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. The ones that just miss might be Paddington 2, Coco, and Baby Driver."
3353,2020-07-21 23:22:38,hvi9na,"I’m disappointed Moana only won one, was only tied for third for Best Original Song(and not even losing it to ""Another Day of Sun""), only third in Best Animated Film, and was so blown out in Best Soundtrack. I love La La Land and really like Zootopia but Moana is better than both imo and deserved more. Such a beautiful film with amazing music, wish it wasn’t as underrated as it is."
3354,2020-07-22 10:14:39,hvi9na,How was Viola Davis not in the leading actress category?
3355,2020-07-27 02:30:21,hvi9na,Where can we check the results for the preferential ballot?
3356,2020-07-22 02:34:08,hvi9na,I was shocked especially because I remembered it having a dominant win in your poll.
3357,2020-07-22 01:44:28,hvi9na,Wasn’t Split 2016?
3358,2020-07-22 16:57:38,hvi9na,"Oh yeah good point. Split is a fun dumb movie, wouldn't really be worth looking at... except McAvoy is just so spectacular. Will have to look at the other contenders though, it's a tough year."
3359,2020-07-22 02:24:33,hvi9na,2017 is such a good year.
3360,2020-07-21 23:41:50,hvi9na,Moana is so good
3361,2020-07-22 14:35:37,hvi9na,"She only has 38% of the screen time, compared to Denzel who has 67% I would say it’s fair."
3362,2020-07-27 02:42:41,hvi9na,I’ll post them all after the 2019 one and before the decade end one.
3363,2020-07-22 02:35:43,hvi9na,"my guess is the relevance of 13th (even if personally, I Am Not Your Negro, is a better doc on the same “topic”)

still 2016 was a great year in film, documentaries included. 3 of the best of the decade in one year"
3364,2020-07-22 02:22:54,hvi9na,Premiered at Fantastic Fest in 2016 but released in January 2017
3365,2020-07-22 17:03:26,hvi9na,It’s a tough year in so many categories I can’t really be mad at any potential snubs just because every category is so strong
3366,2020-07-22 02:40:07,hvi9na,"True it has certainly gained more popularity in the last couple months. It really was a great year for docs, can definitely see OJ still making the decade nominations."
3367,2020-07-22 03:55:37,hvi9na,">my guess is the relevance of 13th (even if personally, I Am Not Your Negro, is a better doc on the same “topic”)

I mean, it's not like OJ: Made in America is less relevant with racial tensions at the forefront"
3368,2020-07-22 02:32:14,hvi9na,"Gotcha. Guess it’ll be eligible, in which case McAvoy deserves recognition. A nomination would be great, he carried the movie, at least for me."
3369,2020-07-22 17:26:19,hvi9na,"I'll be mad when my favorites lose to Phantom Thread, but otherwise yeah agreed."
3370,2020-07-22 12:27:35,hvi9na,I'm guessing it was prominently featured on Netflix in the last month or so and that got a while bunch of new people to see it.
3371,2020-09-06 07:04:54,inf742,I'd rather see this same group tackle an original story than do a third version of The Ring.
3372,2020-09-06 16:22:02,inf742,why Rian Johnson? I don't think Rian could ever write something that would match or interest Fincher's sensibilities. Also seems too sweet and self-aware as a writer to ever do anything pure horror and would have to do some horror comedy subversion
3373,2020-09-06 16:27:26,inf742,Rian Johnson wouldn't write a script for a movie he's not directing himself.
3374,2020-09-06 05:45:37,inf742,Rian Johnson should stay away from being a part of any other franchise. He ruined one already.
3375,2020-09-06 17:32:11,inf742,That too. I just thought it was a fun idea.
3376,2020-09-06 17:38:05,inf742,"I look at Gone Girl & Fight Club as dark comedies, so I guess I thought it’d be fun to imagine Rian writing something darker and wittier. Maybe replace Rian with Gillian Flynn?"
3377,2020-09-06 17:38:48,inf742,"I get that, I’m imagining. Haha. I know it’s never going to happen."
3378,2020-09-06 17:33:11,inf742,"I was just having fun, mate"
3379,2020-09-07 03:45:05,inf742,"Incorrect.  He made the one good film in the most recent trilogy (and, I'd say, one of the two best films in the franchise).  Far better than the garbage excreted by that wretched little collaborator, jj."
3380,2020-09-07 16:12:41,inf742,"There's such a bite to those and a pretty nihilistic undercurrent that Rian has never shown to me. In fact he's the opposite in my eyes as a naive optimist. 

It's been so long since we got a Fincher film I'm interested to see what Mank ends up being."
3381,2020-09-05 07:06:17,imw8h1,That’s so cool! I was looking forward to this one so i’m glad that you liked it. Did it give you Get Out vibes? idk the trailer did so i was just wondering.
3382,2020-09-05 10:04:47,imw8h1,I'll be sure to check it out soon:>
3383,2020-09-05 12:33:33,imw8h1,I just finished the book and the movie seems to be different. Can you confirm?
3384,2020-09-05 15:27:58,imw8h1,"All the reviews are saying mostly the opposite and that janelle is not good.
One called it the worse film of the year.

Think im gonna wait till this one is streaming free lol."
3385,2020-09-05 08:12:27,imw8h1,"Yeah it does have Get Out vibes a little bit, although the structure of it is really different. But similar elements in terms of themes and the really stylised look of it. I personally think Get Out is really hard to top and this doesn't do it, but if you liked Get Out you'll probably enjoy this as well!"
3386,2020-09-05 12:34:14,imw8h1,"I haven't read the book, so I can't confirm or deny unfortunately!"
3387,2020-09-20 02:30:14,imw8h1,The book is one of my favorites. Definitely don’t watch it expecting Kindred. They very very very loosely based an aspect off it.
3388,2020-09-20 19:40:24,imw8h1,[deleted]
3389,2020-09-05 16:21:06,imw8h1,"Always interesting how the same movie can get such different reactions! I barely read any reviews before watching it, so I didn't really have any specific expectations for the movie going in. I think that probably helped my experience.

I can imagine this not being someone's particular thing, but  'the worst movie of the year' is a bit much. I mean, from what I've seen the Mulan remake looks pretty terrible lmao"
3390,2020-09-20 19:40:47,imw8h1,Kindred. It’s definitely based on a book.

3392,2020-09-20 19:49:43,imw8h1,"Look, I’m just saying that the writers/directors of the film have been advertising that this is an adaptation of the book Kindred"

3395,2020-09-03 16:24:00,ilt3eq,I like early Gloria Steinem. Love Toussaint. I hope to like this movie when I see it.
3396,2020-09-03 17:28:35,ilt3eq,I’m in this. Maybe my scene made the cut.
3397,2020-09-03 22:03:00,ilt3eq,Gloria Steinem was Christian Bale’s Stepmom in the 2000s.

3424,2020-09-01 21:17:51,ikn7iq,I know this sub loves Arcade Fire (And I do to) but MBDTF is a top 5 hip hop album of all time and a decade defining masterwork. Kanye has been a fucking idiot as of late but that shouldn’t change the fact that very few things reach the level of impact that MBDTF has had on both hip hop and music at large. Please just separate the art from the artist.

voting for, from losers: Kendrick Lamar>Danny Brown, Kendrick is one of my favorite artists of the decade and even though this one is not my favorite at all it's still great. I like XXX but it never really clicked for me like Atrocity Exhibition. Destroyer>M83, Destroyer is one of my favorite artists and Kaputt is fantastic.

from winners: Bon Iver>St vincent, Some of Bon Iver's best songs are on this one. Fleet Foxes> Car Seat Headrest, I never really loved any Car Seat Headrest album outside of Teens of Denial and the Fleet Foxes album is beautiful."
3432,2020-09-01 20:07:27,ikn7iq,why vote for the bad twin fantasy when you could vote for the good twin fantasy

I can see how films like this  and the Black Lives Matter movement may play into the current race-baiting fears stoked by Trump and ilk, but that's another story."
3451,2020-08-30 15:19:56,ijdwbs,"Not just 2012, but the whole first half of the decade had more concrete “hits”, and this isn’t just my nostalgia speaking. 

when streaming wasn’t as prevalent, we basically listened to what the radio fed us, which meant that if radio picked a song to play a lot, _everyone_ would know it. 

Now with streaming everybody listens to their own things and you end up with #1 songs that the majority of the country has still never heard. song popularity is less concentrated."
3452,2020-08-30 19:27:47,ijdwbs,"Depends where you live. In Latin America 2017 was easily the biggest year. We had big hits like Despacito, Chantaje, Mi Gente, Felices Los 4, Me Rehuso, Mayores, Echame La Culpa, Subeme La Radio, Reggaeton Lento, etc."

3464,2020-08-25 20:14:34,iggjnt,FK YES. That’s so good to hear! You received your download! 😭 You’re ready for the winter solstice. A lot of these Celebrities are Starseeds and they use they music and creativity to guide other starseeds back home. I just had my DNA activation at the beginning of the month. On acid too 😉 Acid literally just open us up to these other dimensions.
3465,2020-08-25 17:49:13,iggjnt,"A lot of this resonated with me I’m not sure where to begin actually 
I’m sure I’ve met her on an acid trip (where tf you getting acid this day and age no ones doing it for me ;-;) I’ve felt the net/web/grid and vibrations, the queerness /nonbinary and femininity part also spoke to me deeply 
I’ve not considered my starseed past yet but you’ve definitely inspired me to study the Arcturian for a bit 
I’d love to hear what else you feel you’ve learned of received from your experience 
Good luck in your journeys"

3467,2020-08-26 04:40:07,iggjnt,"That part about a web is something similar to a DMT experience I had.  I have a spirit guide whom looks typically like a feminine arcturian that I've met in trips since before I knew what Arcturians were.  Anyways, on this DMT trip she appeared and there were and infinite number of her appearing woven into the fabric of reality and even through me.  She told me typical DMT stuff and that was my first and last DMT drip that lifted a lifelong depression."
3468,2020-08-25 18:02:20,iggjnt,I think starseeds are a perfect mix of half feminine and half masculine energy. I once though i was arcturian but now i think im andromedan. I recommend getting a soul painting if you believe you are a soulseed mine revealed a blue alien like figure butting together puzzle pieces.
3469,2020-08-25 23:30:22,iggjnt,"I am buzzing so high right now. I am having the exact same experience. We are connected, more than just a base form. It’s all encompassing. Holy crap. It’s all coming together isn’t it???"

3473,2020-08-25 18:08:30,iggjnt,"Ha! I live in a hippy town in the US with a long and rich history with psychedelics... it’s almost stupidly easy to find acid here. I forget how lucky I am in that regard. 

I’m glad to hear this all resonated with you somehow and in some way. I read a bunch about arcturians last night and everything did deeply resonate with me, but I never found anything about this specific alien feminine, or the whole connection with weaving and spiders (I really think there is something alien or interdimensional about spiders). But I feel strongly that it is a facet of Arcturian consciousness/energy. 

In any case thank you for replying!"
3474,2020-08-26 03:13:28,iggjnt,I need to experience acid. I’m so close to my ne t level ascending
3475,2020-08-26 18:55:11,iggjnt,"Thanks for your comment! It’s weird, I have a lot of queer and trans and non-binary friends, and this aspect of themselves is central to their identities, and their social life, activism, career, etc. I’ve never felt that myself - I just know that I am probably like 75% straight on the Kinsey scale, and present/identify as a cis female but don’t dress or act super feminine. I’ve always felt agender on the inside but never felt like it was a big enough deal to put out there front and center, and change my pronouns and all that. And TBH I will probably continue to live my life as a mostly straight but not super feminine cis woman, and that’s ok. But its really cool to know where that feeling comes from! And to understand how that energy gets expressed in myself and also in the human culture/history in general."
3476,2020-08-26 18:56:20,iggjnt,That’s awesome! And that does sound similar/identical to the being I encountered. I’m really glad to hear she healed your depression :)
3477,2020-08-25 20:40:58,iggjnt,"So I didn’t really go into it... but this feminine was a sort of constructed (??) feminine. I understood this being/vibration as *beyond* gender as we know it, but that it is also here in part to play with, deconstruct, and enhance the “feminine” here on this planet. It’s in line with a lot of current conversations about gender fluidity and breaking down the gender binary, which I know about but never felt personally connected to, until now."
3478,2020-08-26 04:10:52,iggjnt,You’re a problem solver. It’s what makes you happy. You have amazing empathetic powers
3479,2020-08-26 00:49:23,iggjnt,What?? That’s so cool!!
3480,2020-08-25 18:22:37,iggjnt,"That’s curious, it’s interesting that you got the name of one Greek goddess but the goddess you describe would better fit the popular description of Arachne the weaver goddess 
Also Greek, who’s people used to partake in the “Elusyian mysteries “ where they would take psychedelics to meet a goddess and learn her name and wisdom, perhaps that’s something you’d be curious about, but probably old news to you by now lol 
Thanks again for sharing, here hoping my one acid guy comes back to town one day 🥰 and I hope there’s  many more enlightening safe trips for you"
3481,2020-08-26 08:04:54,iggjnt,"I met her last night. She’s amazing. I also met my twin flame sister. She’s extremely gifted. But she can’t focus because she is tuned into way too many vibrations. She can’t process them all at once. I know I can help calm her. But it hurts me so much to see her when she’s overcome. Mother had a DJ turntable set that was essentially the command deck of the Lightship. I was messing around with the midi keyboard & my sister reacted quite negatively when I lost control over the sounds I was generating. Then she and I were about to get locked in & I didn’t keep the volume down so mom told us to shut it down. 

The lights were alternating green & purple."
3482,2020-08-25 18:43:42,iggjnt,"To be honest, It could be Arachne and not Ariadne, lol. In fact it probably is. I didn’t get a name, but I used my limited knowledge of Greek mythology to describe what I saw/felt. Thank you!"

3488,2020-08-23 18:19:17,if7tcw,Happy birthday to my favorite music subreddit 👏🏻
3489,2020-08-23 19:04:30,if7tcw,"I remember how I first found this sub. It was upwards of a 3 and a half years ago. I was on an r/Music thread and someone was talking about Carly, and the person said ""come to r/popheads""! Y'all advertised good back then and since I saw this a lot I finally decided to take a look. I was finally growing into my pop love and this place was exactly what I needed to talk about things I couldn't in real life, and to discover new people in the vein of what I like.

Literally one of the highest quality subs out there, and I can't thank everyone enough for keeping some light in my life even in the darkest times.

Fave pophead moment? Mine was u/wonderbitch26's comment from the Melodrama fresh thread. When I got to experience that in real time I realized I would never be the same again.

Second fave, experiencing u/Janellemonae callously piping in on a thread about Dirty Computer, and the sequential meltdown by everyone including me. Our fave mod queen!"
3490,2020-08-23 18:30:23,if7tcw,The fact that I have been going on r/popheads since about January 2017 is genuinely wild. Happy birthday popheads!!
3491,2020-08-23 19:12:32,if7tcw,"I love Popheads because I'm more likely to get a good discussion about weirdo alternative genres here than from actual communities dedicated to weirdo alternative genres. I think the most replies I've ever gotten was the time I posted a piece of noise music by Merzbow and most people were positively intrigued by it. This sub has bred a culture of pop fans who are kinda down for anything, and I find it very refreshing."

I honestly don’t know how I found this place but I’m glad I did. I rarely venture out of the DD these days but the community here is, usually, really cool and I’ve made some real live human being friends because of popheads. TAKE THAT MOM AND DAD! YOU CAN MEET PEOPLE ON THE INTERNET! AND! You can hang out with them and not die!!!

So here’s to five more years of you guys putting up with my bullshit, Super Bowl threads and my weekly squares that are comprised only of punk rock and Taylor Swift!"

I remember when we hit 1000 😭😭😭 now we’ve made so much noise we’ve gotten noticed by so many of our faves. It’s only up from here. Stream Holiday and Break Up Song ❤️

Edit: seeing all these familiar usernames is giving me the feels. I’ve seen so many Reddit communities crumble under weak/self serving moderators that run the subs into the ground but seeing so many familiar names in the mod list just makes me so happy. We really do have such a lovely community here, minus the locals who dip in to spread negativity then leave. I love you all, genuinely 💕💕❤️💕"

3496,2020-08-23 22:37:01,if7tcw,"I can't believe I found this sub when I was 19 and now I'm barreling towards my quarter life crisis lmao how time flies...

Anyway I hardly ever posted on reddit before this sub and it's the community I've been the most active in by far, I'm so happy to have been around for all the iconic moments and seen this sub transform. I remember I was worried the sub wouldn't get off the ground bc reddit was so ""omg reaaalll music!1!1!"" and I didn't think there was an audience for it. 
I'm so happy that I was wrong lol. There have been bumps along the way but I'm still happy to have somewhere to talk about pop music and pop legends that isn't a complete dumpster fire at all times like Twitter or ATRL."
3497,2020-08-23 18:31:02,if7tcw,"Thank you all so much.

I love coming here everyday to read you all. My favorite place on the internet.

Even though I rarely comment I can identify myself to a lot of things that are being said here and that I can't find irl. Popheads changed my life by making me discover so many amazing artists and for that I'm forever grateful"

I sent them my last-minute message and I am waiting for it to be added in the post. But here's a snippet I want to share because it perfectly summarizes how I feel.

There was like 8000 subscribers at the time. That Joanne release thread and the reactions to Lady Gaga going from avantgarde to country soccer mom will forever be a fond memory of mine!

I’ve been on this sub since mid/late 2016 and while the community has gone through its ups and downs...

Shoutouts to my friends who are still here, I love y’all ❤️❤️❤️"

I’ve been on this sub for probably 3 years ish now, and checking in pretty much daily for a year probably?

And I genuinely love the community here, I have no friends that like pop music, in fact most of them are all “pop music is bad I only listen to indie that’s real music” type of people, so coming here and having like minded people to discuss my love of pop music

And thanks to this sub I’ve discovered so many new artists that have become my new favourites, and has really cemented my love of pop music, and I’ve learnt so much more about music and have a deeper respect for songs that I probably wouldn’t have if I didn’t come here, so thank you all for broadening my horizons"

I can't remember how I found popheads - I must have been looking for a pop music subreddit at the time - but at the time of discovering it, if someone had told me I'd still be here today, I'm not sure I would've believed it. Today, I am immensely proud to be the admin of our popheads Discord. I've seen so much stuff over the years. I've been able to meet some genuinely amazing friends through the popheads reddit and Discord community. Thank you kappy for creating this place.

Here's to 5 more years!"

I've been on and off here for the past four-ish years (more to do with the binge/purge relationship I have with social media generally than anything specifically to do with the sub), but I'm so glad this sub exists, and has continued to not only exist in a really wholesome and productive way over the course of its run, but grow from a tiny niche of nerds into a widely-respected and appreciated forum that's been able to attract major attention from the artists it idolizes. This sub has been instrumental in helping me seek out those mid-popularity artists who might have slipped in between being mainstream and being super experimental and weird that the indiehead in me would have sought them out. I would probably never have fallen head over heels for MUNA, Sigrid, Mitski, Rina, Kacey, etc. if it weren't for this group of people. I've loved jumping in on megathreads and discussions with people who are as passionate and respectful as this sub is, and the rates have of course been iconique. I did not put it together that my first rate as a host was going to wrap up on the sub's birthday, but I think it's very cool that it did, and I'm hoping to be here for many more bdays, rates, and plug meltdowns to come xx"

3523,2020-08-24 17:16:18,if7tcw,I stumbled across this sub 3 years ago and it's been my fav ever since. I was active in a bunch of pop star forums for Avril and Ashlee Simpson in the 00s but once those fizzled I didn't really have a community for music. Popheads changed that and reignited my passion for pop music! Thanks for all you do to keep this sub going.

3557,2020-10-10 22:14:45,j83hsn,Definitely willing but based on the few enquiries I’ve had so far it’s likely to be prohibitively expensive unless there’s anything on my list that’s harder to find in the US. A 1.5kg package (so maybe 3 or 4 LPs) costs £32 which is crazy

3625,2020-09-25 20:47:37,izolm4,I’ve been getting told that THIS is the year we’re having a revolution every year since like 2008.
3626,2020-09-25 20:05:55,izolm4,"I feel like we are on the eve of a revolution at best. I mean we're trying to vote in Joe Biden of all people. And I think people are forgetting how much of a not great candidate he is because his direct comparison is Trump. I mean he's okay for keeping the country from ripping itself apart (which is what Trump seems to keep fueling), but he is no revolutionary. And I don't know of any congressional candidates that are truly revolutionary (in terms of truly scaling back capitalist exploitation). At best, we have a bunch of center/slightly center left democrats who will do enough to appease American ""leftists"" (lmao) while still not instituting any fundamental (and meaningful) change."

3629,2020-09-25 23:57:31,izolm4,I mean I think four more years of this guy really isn’t gonna help y’all.
3630,2020-09-26 04:49:32,izolm4,"the revolution doesnt happen from one day to the next, comrade"
3631,2020-09-26 19:07:49,izolm4,To be fair we are edging closer and closer to fascism. There’s no doubt in my mind that Trump wouldn’t push to be a dictator
3632,2020-09-26 00:27:52,izolm4,"There’s a lyric in the song that goes “We’re kicking out the old regime” and I’m like... how is Biden, the former Vice President, NOT the old regime?"
3633,2020-09-26 09:48:08,izolm4,"*I don’t know of any congressional candidates that are truly revolutionary*

I mean this is self-contradictory because “true revolutionaries” would be against electoralism entirely, but there are a good number of DSA-backed candidates around the country who are either in office or are slated to win.  We have the Squad in addition to a few more Congressional candidates and on the state level there’s [a pretty impressive slate of self-proclaimed democratic socialists](https://electoral.dsausa.org/our-endorsements/).  In reality they’re more like social democrats than socialists but still, I think that’s the one of the farthest-left options we can get if we’re working within the democratic system."
3634,2020-09-26 01:10:37,izolm4,"Honestly ideal plan is that Trump Fails to concede, conflict arises, then coup d'etat for a socialist government."
3635,2020-09-26 00:25:00,izolm4,"Its an incredibly complex issue that has spanned decades. 

Most voting rights issues are really more voting ‘discouragement’ issues. Like, a governor will put up 100 voting centers in Area 1 and then only put up 5 voting centers for Area 2 despite them being the same size. Yes everyone in Area 2 could technically vote, but its much more difficult. And usually Area 1 will just *coincidentally* (not really) be mostly the same party as the governor while Area 2 isn’t.

Another issue is rights for felons (people who committed major crimes) to vote after they get out of prison. Many states do not allow felons to ever vote, and America is one of only 4 countries in the world that allow this. Certain states like Florida only allow felons to vote after they’ve paid the state back their legal fees, even though most felons aren’t rich enough to do so."
3636,2020-09-26 00:30:11,izolm4,"This varies by state, but in many places convicted felons and/or prisoners can't vote, even though they contribute to the overall population, and therefore the number of representatives and tax dollars given to the county or state. When we talk about voting rights now, we're really talking about equal opportunities for voting and having your vote count. Issues like the electoral college, gerrymandering, extraneous laws around absentee and mail-in ballots, etc., create a system where not all votes count equally, and even exercising the right to vote is made harder for some people."
3637,2020-09-26 18:04:01,izolm4,"[Voter suppression](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_suppression_in_the_United_States) isn’t strictly illegal in all cases. It’s done through both legal and illegal means. Democracy in the United States is pretty special, and we have a lot of people who work very hard to ensure it works, but it’s not perfect by any means."
3638,2020-09-26 12:54:15,izolm4,"The prison industrial complex was a massive campaign from the US government to basically institute modern day slavery. You plant drugs in the black community. So cops associate drugs and violence with black communities, and begin to racially profile black people and black communities (not that they weren't from day one, considering the modern form of policing was born from the slave patrol system)...

So then you lock up a disproportionate number of black americans, which deprives them of their voting rights. Ofc, then it only perpetuates the cycle of violence when black kids grow up with an incarcerated dad who's not in their lives. Their needs do not end up being met so perhaps they turn to crime themselves. 

Not to mention some prisons in america are PRIVATELY OWNED AND FOR PROFIT so they damn near have QUOTAS on how many people they want to legally enslave within their system. This practice outsources unpaid or minimally paid prison labor to america's megacorporations.

Overall.... The whole thing is just really sad. It's dumb and motivated by racism, and the government has never cared about black people. Probably never will until the system is burned to the fucking ground."

I just imagined that this just might be something exciting and fun for Grimes and my proposed band to perform. I certainly know it would be exceptionally fun and exciting for hard core and causal fans alike. I also know something like this could never happen, but it’s still nice to imagine. Anyway, who knows what Grimes has in store for us as her music and persona matures. I’m sure intrigued. Peace!"

3705,2020-09-19 22:39:30,ivnq5w,"I think the difference here is that the images that are posted are “female gaze” instead of the more predominant “male gaze” images posted in the subs for women’s photos. Not all photos here mind you, but most."

3710,2020-09-19 19:36:28,ivnq5w,">And some of us might only want to see men.

So make a third sub that's men-only instead of whining about it in a sub that's upfront from the start about including all genders."
3711,2020-09-20 03:44:36,ivnq5w,"I think that’s the point of r/ladyladyboners. This sub is expected to be built around the female gaze, but most subs that are meant for photos of women cater to the male gaze, so there was a need specifically for one with photos of women that caters to the female gaze. Subs with hot men that cater to the female gaze aren’t as hard to come by as subs with hot women that cater to the female gaze. At least, that’s my guess about the reasoning."

3714,2020-09-20 21:27:02,ivnq5w,So much unnecessary hostility. It’s reddit. Calm tf down.
3715,2020-09-19 02:37:48,ivjumw,"It was a good movie. Could have been great, but ultimately I felt misled by the marketing campaign. 

Still a fun watch and the third act had some awesome payoff as you said!"
3716,2020-09-19 05:24:10,ivjumw,Really?  I thought it was terrible.  Waste of time to watch.
3717,2020-09-19 05:44:37,ivjumw,Janelle Monae is a great actor! She killed it in S2 if Homecoming.

3720,2020-09-19 02:39:16,ivjumw,"Yes in hindsight I think the trailers gave too much away, I got spoiled of the twist going in, but the “you are chosen” thing was way too spoilery imo"
3721,2020-09-19 20:59:00,ivjumw,Really? I enjoyed it quite a bit
3722,2020-09-19 03:04:05,ivjumw,"For me it was >!the trailer shot of the airplane briefly disappearing, which then subsequently did not appear in the film; it heavily implied a sci-fi component that simply did not apply!<. While I liked the twist, it just felt a bit unsatisfying."
3723,2020-09-18 22:27:15,ivfr5j,"Fiction about American slavery, like fiction about the Holocaust, seems to all too easily slip into torture porn and exploitation.

3730,2020-11-07 18:33:53,jpscg4,She has the perfect vibe and personality for an extraterrestrial Green Lantern.
3731,2020-11-07 22:03:47,jpscg4,great now I'm never going to stop hoping for this exact casting
3732,2020-11-07 15:58:26,jpscg4,This is a good look. I don't keep up on all the projects but can Janelle act?

3736,2020-11-07 20:55:02,jpscg4,This is dope.
3737,2020-11-07 23:48:52,jpscg4,Dig the overall look but Jo is definitely thiccer. At least in the latter issues.
3738,2020-11-08 14:09:09,jpscg4,10/10 would subscribe to HBO Max just for this
3739,2020-11-09 11:04:47,jpscg4,Nice! That's a good look for her. I hope this series can succeed where the movie failed.
3740,2020-11-07 15:42:41,jpscg4,This would be amazing.
3741,2020-11-07 19:27:00,jpscg4,Those are Kamedas sunglasses
3742,2020-11-07 19:43:29,jpscg4,I think she would be a better Bumblebee

3745,2020-11-07 22:16:35,jpscg4,She's an alien? I know nothing about the character
3746,2020-11-07 16:55:47,jpscg4,"Yes. Watch Hidden Figures, Moonlight, Harriet or Philip K Dick’s Electric Dreams, she’s a very good actress."
3747,2020-11-08 00:45:08,jpscg4,I think there’s a rumor Mullein could show up in the HBO Max GL series.
3748,2020-11-07 21:56:13,jpscg4,"No, this is fan art."
3749,2020-11-07 21:57:53,jpscg4,What did you dislike about it? It’s probably my favorite comic of the year.
3750,2020-11-07 22:52:53,jpscg4,"She's not.  She's a human among far-flung, very inhuman and yet well-written aliens."
3751,2020-11-07 22:17:02,jpscg4,Lol me neither truthfully. I just like the look.
3752,2020-11-07 17:41:04,jpscg4,"Thanks for the list. Not for nothing, but my grandfather was a (black) sharecropper in Alabama, and my dad and uncles were active in community building growing up, and I used to work in behavioral health (also I'm from Flint). I actively sidestep black suffering in movies. I watched the first three episodes Electric Dreams, then I drifted away. I'll come back for her episode."
3753,2020-11-08 04:02:01,jpscg4,God I hope that rumor is correct.
3754,2020-11-07 19:13:07,jpscg4,Moonlight definitely trades in Black pain as its primary focus but I think it's done in a way that isn't necessarily exploitative of it if that makes sense. Like it feels more of a defiance of that narrative than a continuation of it just through how tender it is
3755,2020-11-07 23:59:31,jpscg4,"She’s in Homecoming season 2 on Amazon. She’s the lead and she’s pretty good in it. Definitely watch season 1 first, it’s a direct continuation, and you won’t know wtf is happening if you don’t. Plus Julia Roberts is the lead in season 1, and it’s great.

It’s a drama with sort of a techish lean."
3756,2020-11-08 00:55:13,jpscg4,Definitely check out Hidden Figures if you haven’t seen it. It’s a super interesting piece of history and a really enjoyable movie.
3757,2020-11-07 20:11:20,jpsbpu,Her “glasses” are way cooler than cruz’s “tattoo”
3758,2020-11-07 23:38:15,jpsbpu,"I wouldn't be surprised if the design for Jo was based on Janelle in the first place.

After all, Hal was originally based on late 50s Paul Newman"

3764,2020-11-07 17:03:01,jpsbpu,Is this official because it looks like it is.
3765,2020-11-08 16:25:14,jpsbpu,"It does make her look like a pokemon gym leader, but that's not a bad thing."

is lovecraft country good? what is it?"

3787,2020-10-12 18:33:03,j9uvx3,"It’s brilliant! It’s a horror/drama TV show based on the book by the same name. Every episode has been impeccable and delves into a lot of untold stories concerning black history. You should give it a watch, the soundtrack is amazing as well."
3788,2020-10-12 20:37:12,j9uvx3,"it's SO good, especially if you love supernatural horror. The first episode was kinda meh, and the pacing was slow, but the second episode had me on my toes unable to guess what was happening. The show is full of twists and fantastical creatures and so much lore. They draw on so many myths, legends and tropes (even from Korea) and use them to not only examine what it means to be black in America - a grossly underrepresented demo in the genre - they do what SciFi does best and question what it means to be human or monster."

*spoiler: a character literally dies and comes back to life in one episode and by the next settling into her home with racist neighbors brings her stress before holding a circle to expel unhappy ghosts. Then she moves right on again. Makes zero sense."
3790,2020-10-12 20:39:34,j9uvx3,"hahaha. You're SO right. That simple imagery of that one lyric has been completely turned on its head. This show has been a wild experience, especially for someone like me who is kinda queasy with gore, but damn I've loved it."

This issue came up before on my previous post, this was the solution provided by Mega Support:

Open your MEGA account in a browser. Just before you are about to click 'Download' of the affected file press F12 (Option + cmd + J) to open your JavaScript Console. The screen will divide. Type 'skipcheck=1' in the bottom line of the Console, click 'Enter' and then select the 'Download' in your MEGA account window."

I'm not sure how my post come up since I have zero Elliot Smith in my collection, but I'm glad that it found you!

1. Copy the long code near the top of the post

2. Google ""base64"" and click on the first site that pops up (one that ends in .org), 

3. Make sure ""Decode"" is selected at the top once you're in the website (it should be the default)

4. Paste the code in the top field where it reads ""Type (or paste) here...""

5. Press ""< DECODE >""

6. The decoded link which would be a Mega link in this place will show up on the bottom field

7. Copy and paste this link to your URL and that should take you to my index

Hope that helps."

Most of the titles I only have one version of, so searching up the catalog numbers and including them to my organization system doesn't make much sense in my specific case. For the ones I have multiple versions of I do specify in the sub folders, to the best of my ability, which version's which.

> Holy Gay Anthem Batman! 

> Juice has become a quintessential gay anthem, and a gay anthem that is adored beyond the confines of /r/popheads. For once, Popheads was able to get behind the star-power of Lizzo early on in her career, and the adoration of her work and singles seemed to resonate beyond our tiny shithole on the Internet. Juice itself didn't become a massive hit, but it broke into the top 100, and is quite recognizable among the gays and straights alike. 

> Juice is just so well loved across the board. It was coupled with a strong music video, great live performances, and a star who is so bubbly and nearly-impossible to hate, it's no wonder Lizzo has become a mainstay in the hearts of so many of us. 

> Juice was also a shoe-in for the top for a majority of its original rate. Cruel Summer definitely tried it, but Juice took the lead about halfway through, and it never got close again. A serving of juice is typically recommended to be on the smaller end, lots of sugar, and its benefits are typically outweighed by the negatives, but this Juice is made up of pure charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and talent, and all doctors recommend a 2 liter of it a day to keep the homophobes away. - /u/wailord_fan

---

And so the /r/popheads moderation team defeats the /r/popheadscirclejerk once and for all. ""Juice"" was in the lead for the vast majority of the voting period, yet in the final days its lead shrank and shrank until even an errant 7 was suddenly making it flip back and forth with Janelle. in the end, our beloved moderator pulled through, but not without a hard-fought battle.

Lizzo won her rate against Taylor, Ariana, and Billie in the most participated rate of all time, featuring their 2019 year-defining albums. ""Juice"" might not've been the hit it deserved to be, but ever since those 80s-inspired synths drifted into our ears in early January, we were hooked. (Like, can you imagine if ""Cruel Summer"" were in this rate instead? The horror.) The fact that she made it this far, and was in first for a solid part of the voting, is proof that we still consider ""Juice"" to be a whole-ass bop. I'm proud of the sub for rallying behind Lizzo, who is in so many ways not your typical image of a pop music figure, yet she is one regardless. Even though 2020 has been a quiet year for her, I'm still confident that her talent and penchant for creating incredible bops will further endear us as her career progresses.

> Caroline struck gold with this song, upon closer inspection, it's really not hard to see why this song is so beloved and how it win its original rate. The light and bouncy production paired with Caroline's effortless vocal delivery makes for an instantly danceable tune and by extension, her signature solo song so far. It also helps that this is a topic that many can relate to. It's earnest in its simplcity while also having enough quirks that makes it more than sum of its parts, the ""show me the banana"" part never fails to make me smile in its absurdity. - /u/skargardin

---

Caroline Polachek going from generally unknown Chairlift member to beloved /r/popheads darling capable of toppling Charli and Carly in the span of a year was a bit surprising, but not too surprising; a skinny white girl making weird, pleasant, and decent alt-pop is a irresistible combination for any bottom. While most of *Pang* takes itself rather seriously, ""So Hot You're Hurting My Feelings"" is distinctly sillier and more fun. And how can you not be, with a title like that? Caroline sings about how she needs this man to oh please not send her any sexy pictures, because she's already crying on the dance floor and seeing him will just make her feel worse. Like, just imagine her at a club, ""Fergalicious"" blasting on the stereo, and suddenly a dick pic flashes up on her screen — one so activates her nether regions so intensely that she bursts into tears. The drama!

I enjoy this campy little song enough; my only real problem is that her questionable enunciation gets in the way of the featherlight feeling, best represented by how that cry of ""uradhaheoney one who knows me babe!"" dampens the chorus. But after the onslaught of downtempo tracks ""Door,"" ""Ocean of Tears,"" and ""Parachute,"" this song was a true delight to hear from her, where she could let loose and dance around and channel her sadness into a campy fervor. I especially enjoy how, in an album full of bizarre (and mildly unlistenable) [whale-watching noises](https://youtu.be/g_VgkkURF_w?t=63) (including on this song), the most visceral sound she makes with her mouth isn't one of those moans, but that sharp gasp at the end of the bridge, like she's been shot through the heart or finally been shown the banana. It's a one-second sound that manages to convey so much — the true pièce de résistance of not only the song but also the entire album.

**fxsparrow** (11): One of my most played songs this year

**jasannn** (11): I've only known this song since July after lurking through the rates. I was expecting Charli or Carly to win for sure based off the subreddit's love for them. I was shocked to find out the feature on ""Tears"" won the rate with a pretty high score. I was underwhelmed on my first listen but its simplicity and catchiness slowly took over my summer and it has been on repeat everyday since. Thank you Popheads for showing me this incredible song.

> Estelle and Kanye blew everyone out of the park in the second Charity Rate, to everyone-but-me's pleasure. I said it then and I'll say it again - this song leans heavily on nostalgia that I just don't have. There's some notes and vocal runs in the verses that make me physically cringe - it's like nails on a chalkboard. However, LITERALLY everyone else was happy with this, so YAY democracy. - /u/CarlieScion

---

How did this 2000s song by a relatively forgotten singer and Kanye West, a song that praises America and bougieness, win not just one rate, but make it all the way to the top 10 of this rate? The answer is that it's a fucking *jam*, and the innocence that comes with this American fetishization is palatable coming from Estelle's innocent, distinctly British delivery. It's just so cool, and Estelle even gets peak Coolye to deliver a smooth verse. How can you not be charmed by it? Like, just compare this to shit like ""London Boy"" to see how important sounding coquettish and laidback can be when singing about a place you're not familiar with. 

""American Boy"" firmly planted itself in the top 5 for much of the rate, but fell slightly as time wore on. Part of me hoped that it could pull through for the win, but this top 10 placement is more than fine for it. I'm also glad nobody really seemed to be calling for its head throughout these reveals, or was even worried it would be going before day 3. Even if you don't like it that much, you know it's beloved enough to make it far regardless.

**Ghost-Quartet** (11): One of my favorite memories from college was being at my friend’s birthday party (we were housemates so it was in my house) and like an hour into this party, when everyone was buzzed enough to be happy but not drunk enough to be messy, this song came on. EVERYONE in the party absolutely lost their minds and everybody knew all the words and they sang along to it together, I don’t think I’ve ever seen such pure joy radiating off of a group of people. This song is timeless and basically flawless, I’d love to see it win another rate. Also I’ve become more and more of an Estelle fan with time, I think she’s a class act with a fantastic discography that goes heavily underrated by music fans and I’d encourage everybody to dig into the album this came from and the followup because they’re both great.

**ignitethephoenix** (11): I’m not lying when I say this is one of the greatest songs of the 21st century so far. A cultural reset and Kanye’s best feature"

**Congrats to Janelle!!!!**
 
Make Me Feel is now the 3rd song to have 2+ wins, after Toxic and Bad Romance! Unlike the other two songs though, it's the only one to get both wins its first 2 rates (instead of taking 3)!


**Songs**

- Dancing On My Own and We Belong Together both end up on the 'Most Rated' leaderboard now with 4 rates a piece. Still far from the current leader, but I think it's time they get a bit of rest (as someone who has given DOMO 4 11's)

- White people getting their revenge today: Running Up That Hill now has the #8 spot for most 11's from all rates pushing down songs from Gaga, Whitney, and more Gaga

- Not listed, but Closer is our first song to win songeniality 2 times!!! We love our subreddit visiting legends!! Closer for AS4!!

**Artists**

- With her win today, Janelle enters the top 20 for highest scoring artists at #19! We love to see some mod representation!!!

- Carole King falls out of the top 10 score leaderboard to #11 allowing ABBA to take over. Not all is lost though, since she managed to keep her zeroless streak going to 13 songs!

- Lady Gaga overtakes Madonna for #5 of most songs rated thanks to her double appearance in this rate

- For most rate appearances we have a lot of new artists enter the top 10 at 13 rates including Kanye West, The Weeknd, Kesha, and Lady Gaga. Also appearing, even though we've never done any of his albums, Jay-Z has been in 13 rates with 20 songs? Black Album rate when??

> If I wasn't just absent entirely from popheads and wrote these write-ups prior to the day before the reveal, and did this rate, this song would be my 11. 

>It's an inexplainable emotion that I get when I listen to this song. For 5 minutes, I don't exist in my bedroom, house, city or state. It sounds like an over-exaggeration or pretty spin on a song's quality, but there is something genuinely inexplainable and immaculate about this song that transcends a written description. 

>Instead, I want to share the place I arrive when I listen. 

>I am on a bright hill. Completely isolated, but also entirely free. The only forces I feel are the sun, wind, and gravity. The gravity is heavy, heavier than I am used to. Any step is difficult, hard, almost painful. The feeling is so stark in contrast to how the rest of my body feels, the struggle I am facing in moving and acting is completely focused on my own personal experience. The sun is out, the hills, grass, flowers, are all flowing easily in the wind, and the day and enviornment feels perfect, but my path is so insanely difficult. I want to cry and scream, but I can't because it's not something that others can relate or empathize with. I can't go crazy because of the forces and emotions I feel, this gravity, because it's not tangible to some people. I have to be able to mesh with my surroundings, even if this invisible feeling is making the simple task of walking up a hill so difficult. 

>The song has become how I would describe my path with depression, anxiety, and other darker thoughts. It's not an impossible journey, but it's something that I had ignored for so long in my life. It's a strange song, it's a fucking fantastic song. I sincerely hope this song at least makes it to the final day. - /u/wailord_fan

This elimination goes out to /u/plvstvcbvrds and their agenda against this shrieking white woman! I know it's been painful to see it get this high, even to the top 5, but at least she was stopped here, as the last white person of them all. Well done, popheads! We weren't as racist as we tend to be this time!

All that aside, I still gave this an easy 10, because it really is a perfect song to me. I'm a pretentious bitch at heart, and Kate Bush waxing poetically about how she wants to switch places with a man (invoking God and hills and all other kinds of shit) does make me perky, and the 80s synths are a great foundation for her musings. Also, Meg Myers has [a really nice cover of this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7iVWK2W48o)! Go check it out if you feel like supporting a different shrieking white woman.

**agentofscranton** (11): I love this song so much, as hard as it is for me to listen to it without tearing up. I didn't do this rate, but this would've been my 11 then too. Just one of the most beautiful and legendary pieces of music of all time.

**bbfan132** (11): i will always give my 11 to kate bush, especially when i’m rating one of the best songs of all time

**camerinian** (11): This is a flawless song from a flawless album. I don't even know how someone could dislike this. The scale of this song is something to behold, with all of its high melodrama and the thunderous sound of every single element of this song, like it was recorded in a cathedral. That and the fact that it's aged like fine wine. If someone told me this song was released by an indie artist in 2014 and I didn't know any better, I'd believe them, because everything about this composition is timeless. Kate's delivery is delicate and commanding in equal measure and the massive gothic instrumentation is the perfect complement. This is a top 5 song of all time for me, God bless this

**cloudbustingmp3** (11): THERE IS THUNDER IN OUR HEEEAAAAARTS!!!!!!!!!!! the greatest opening track of all time, the greatest lead single of all time, from the greatest album of all time BY the greatest artist of all time? aaaaah that's history

**engifear** (11): Everyday I run up my silly little hill and make my silly little deal with God.

**InternetDude19** (11): This may be the greatest song ever.

**Ionlywanttheworld** (11): my favorite song of all time

**lIIustration** (11): beautiful. Just beautiful.

**quinnpsych** (11): I seriously can't emphasise how much I love this song. I only first listened to this song in early 2020 (I know.), but it's magical and haunting and the production is amazing, what else can I say?

**runaway3212** (11): My mom is a Kate Bush stan, I guess you could say taste runs in the family.

**sarcasticsobs** (11): very difficult rate, obvious since it’s the “winners” rate, but i mean c’mon. look at the flair. kate bush is my mom

**vayyiqra** (11): This is my favourite song of all time and I can't even put into words what it means to me so I'm just going to give it an 11 and let it speak for itself

**WeastofEden44** (11): By far one of my fav songs of all-time, period. Kate Bush could WASH any of the flops and fads we talk about 💅

**welcometoNY** (11): nothing on this earth compares to the rush of serotonin i get when that synth comes in. basically the greatest pop song ever made. easiest 11 of my life.

**worlds-okayest666** (11): perfect song in every way. period. i can’t sing this song’s praises enough LMAO i love it so much, it’s such a masterpiece. really really hoping y’all don’t do it dirty

**yatcho** (11): The best song of all time, sorry I don't make the rules"

> all stars 2, in my opinion, was one of the best collections of songs we've had in a rate, with not just one song in this winners rate, but two, thanks to dancing on my own's separate victory. however, the edge of glory was, in my opinion, one of the most deserving winners possible to win as2. it's one of gaga's strongest tracks, perfectly euphoric and anthemic in a way that is just so gaga. lady gaga winning on a popheads grab bag rate may be an overly expected stereotype, but this song really rises above the rest to be a discography standout for her. - /u/InfernalSolstice

---

This might be surprising to learn, but sometimes Lady Gaga does not make good career decisions. One such decision came in 2011 when, at the height of her popularity, she decided to release ""Judas"" on the good Christian people of the world — on Easter, of all days. The song didn't do well, almost killing her streak of top 10 hits in America, and so Lady Gaga did something that she's done several times since: She canned this second single in favor of a different song, in this case ""The Edge of Glory,"" which was at the time a promotional track.

It was a good decision, thankfully. ""The Edge of Glory,"" in its stadium rock greatness, got her back on track for a solid album rollout. Not even a shitty music video that was pumped out after her collaboration with Joseph Khan fell through could stop its rise. If anything, it might be her biggest classic this side of ""Bad Romance,"" and it's still a great electropop song that has aged well over the years. Written after the passing of her grandfather, Gaga sings about death as a wondrous transformation, something to welcome when the time comes, not to hide from, as long as you're with the ones you love. Clarence Clemons's saxophone solo ties the whole thing together, and the gravitas of the song only intensifies when you learn that this was the final song he worked on before he passed on. 

This song quickly rose to the top 10 and inched ever so slowly higher and higher, but it was blocked right on the edge of the top 5 in the end. Of the two Gaga songs to make it this far, I am glad that it's this one, even if ""Poker Face"" is more representational of her career and impact. ""The Edge of Glory"" remains a beautiful track with a touching message. I always listen through all five plus minutes whenever this comes on, from the opening heartbeats to the flatline in the coda.

> I Will Survive: One of the biggest gay anthems of all time. This may not be my favorite song from the Classic Disco Singles Rate, but this definitely feels like one of the most important songs of the rate. An iconic piano line, some great vocals, and I ""fuck you, I know I'm strong"" attitude make this a MOMENT in pop music, and LGBT history. 

 > **Covering the Covers:** Despite me doing 4 different I Will Survive covers in the original reveal, I still somehow missed [The Pussycat Dolls' cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qy-2huCXM4) of this song. They remixed with their original song Hush Hush, and it was their final single from 2009 until React in 2020. Listening to the remix, it's not surprising this wasn't the big hit that helped them out, even when they were just coming off of Jai Ho being their last single. - /u/ImADudeDuh

---

""I Will Survive"" fluctuated around the edge of the 10 top all throughout voting, never dipping too much higher or too much lower. Its standing here as voting came to a close got extremely shaky, but titles can be destinies — she did end up surviving into day 3, beating out Outkast and those damn ABBA songs in the process.

""I Will Survive"" is a relatively straightforward song, with a simple melody and lyrics about letting a deadbeat man go, all held together by Gloria Gaynor's glorious vocals. Yet the song has taken on more meaning ever since it became a disco hit in the late 70s, becoming a rallying cry of sorts for the LGBT community as they underwent the blunt of the AIDS epidemic. Sometimes you need that direct, confident message of survival just to make it through to the next day, and you can't help but feel stronger about yourself when you listen to the song. I believe this is the only track in this rate to have even been put in the National Recording Registry because of its cultural relevance — only a slightly more impressive distinction that being a popheads-rate-winning song."

> What's left to say about this classic that hasn't already been said? From the iconic, show-stopping horn line that signaled that Beyoncé did NOT come to play with her solo material, to the music video, Beyoncé's commanding vocals, Jay-Z's feature and everything in between, this is undoubtedly a modern classic in every sense of the word. This song proved Beyoncé's sheer star power and has gone on to be a staple in her discography and tours. Everything about it just screams summer anthem, it isn't hard to see why it originally won the songs of the summer rate. - /u/skargardin

>Still Beyoncé's signature song after all these years and for a good reason. The hook sample, the bridge, everything just works. May be an unpopular opinion but I love the 2014 Remix so much too. - /u/Leixander

---

This song literally ended careers, and we have no choice but to stan. Released in 2003 as her proper debut as a soloist, ""Crazy In Love"" stomped its way up the charts and immediately established Beyonce as a force all on her own. (Well, aside from Jay-Z's verse, which was allegedly cooked up in 10 minutes on the spot.) It's crazy to think that before this, the concept of a solo Beyonce wasn't [an obvious sell](https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/06/arts/music-the-solo-beyonce-she-s-no-ashanti.html) to much of the world — Kelly Rowland was the first one to get a big hit, with her feature on ""Dilemma"". But Beyonce strut her way to the front of the pack, with those tooting trumpets heralding her arrival.

""Crazy In Love"" won the Billboard Song of the Summers rate, and this is my preferred kind of summer song: effortlessly fun, and manic in all the right spots. Its fiery hot energy is downright infectious, perfect for jiggling your ass around as a fire hydrant explodes behind you. Those weird /r/music people would probably be shook to see us get Beyonce this high, and I couldn't be happier about it!

> There is so much to say about the journey Dancing on My Own has been on. Upon release it was commercial flop. It never charted on the Billboard Hot 100, along with the album it was from ""Body Talk"" peaking at #168 on the UK Chart and #142 on the Billboard 200 chart. However as time would prove it was truly 'ahead of its time'. As time went on through word of mouth and pop music shifted it was apparent how influential this song was, along with the culture being affected by the Poptimism Movement (which was not just blanketly dismissing all pop music as having no artistic value).  Legendary music producer Max Martin said it was ""one of the best pop songs ever made"" and would say throughout the 2010s many ""female artists"" he worked with would ""put it on the table and say I wanna make this!"".  Robyn became the queen and standard for every ""Cry On The Dancefloor"" pop song.

Due to people finally catching up with Robyn the song would later go on to be certified Platinum in the US along with the cover done by Calum Scott in 2016 going Double Platinum in the US.  At the end of the decade aggregating site Acclaimed Music ranked it The Best Song of the 2010s based off it toping the greatest song of the decade list on  Rolling Stone, NME, Stereogum, Slant Magazine, Consequence of Sound,The Associated Press, Insider, Esquire, iNews, Vanyaland  and Audiofemme. Paste and Good Housekeeping ranked it second, along with Pitchfork ranking it third. In conclusion this is the definitively the best pop song of the decade and arguably the best song of the 2010s. - /u/JunkyGS

---

I understand the love for this song just as much as I do its slightly surprising animosity. If you were a forum homosexual, or just a general homosexual, in 2010, you probably had this song shoved down your throat perpetually online, while in real life you'd be very unlikely to ever actually encounter it on the radio. It had the perfect blend of catchiness, gay appeal, and legitimate critical acclaim, so much so that the gays, the Pitchfork people, and the Pitchfork gays have not stopped yelling about this song and Robyn since then. If you aren't charmed by the song, I can see it being rather annoying. In addition, the fact that it took Calum Scott to straightwash it (before he came out of the closet) to make it a hit was partly hilarious, mostly insulting.

""Dancing On My Own"" remains a gay staple. Robyn taps into the solitude that comes from not only rejection, but being rejected in favor of someone better than you, and it's easy to imagine a homo crying about this as they think about their straight crush with his girlfriend. Yet the pulsating beat (one that we've heard so many times since, yet not before this song), and the crystalline synths chiming above encourage you not to despair, but to continue dancing, even if you're on your own. It's a song of strength and self-reliance, and it's a song that's always there for you when you need it.

> It's not a surprise that How Will I Know not only won the 80s Dancepop Debuts rate, but also scored the highest average in popheads rate history! Seeing How Will I Know's average just go up and up with every 11 it received was so exciting to see, and honestly, it makes sense. What's not to love about the song? It's a great synthpop jam from a legendary artist with extremely great vocals and one of the world's first introductions to the one and only Whitney Houston. While it won't be my 11, I'm definitely going to be rooting for this song to do well because it's super catchy and just pure fun! - /u/ElectricBoogaloo41

---

And the highest rated song of all time goes down! Whitney's formula for having questionable albums with a few incredible singles doesn't quite work when she has only the singles in the rate, but ""How Will I Know"" still easy rose above the chaff and snagged a whole lot of perfect marks. It might not be her biggest hit, but it's still an undeniable jam and a half, and a great representation of the 80s dancepop bops that informed its original rate.

""How Will I Know"" was initially written for Janet Jackson, who passed on it, then was shifted over to Whitney's camp who was in search of a solid dance track as they readied her debut album. And what a hit it turned out to be! As Whitney's second #1, and her first that wasn't a ballad, it established her voice as prime not only for the slow shit, but also perfect for the upbeat boppity bops. She sings, [as Stereogum put it](https://www.stereogum.com/2107774/the-number-ones-whitney-houstons-how-will-i-know/columns/the-number-ones/), like she already knows, and the uncertainty in the title never comes through in the song, which is forceful and confident. Whitney might not have taken the crown this time, but watch out for another one of her dance tracks in the Winners Rate III!

> This song was fairly formative to me. when it came out, I had recently accepted that I was bisexual, and also very recently started digging into pop music. This song, and its video is just so unabashedly queer. Prince's influence on Janelle also shines through, with the funky bass and a guitar line that rivals the opening to Kiss. This song, like much of Janelle's discography, is ultimately about being oneself, and not letting any authority get in the way of that. It is one of the best pop songs of the past few years. - /u/static_int_husp

---

Who else could it be? Janelle Monáe, as you know, is not only an esteemed singer, actress, and record producer. She is also a moderator of this little subreddit called /r/popheads; she was initially added as a joke until she suddenly accepted the request, and has since poked her head in when she's felt like it. Will she poke her head in for this one too? I sure hope so, but I do think she'd be understandably confused about what all this means. If you do end up reading this Janelle, it just means (once again) that we love you! We love you a lot! We love you even more than we love Kate Bush and two ABBA songs and Years & Years (it's okay if you don't know who they are — most people don't)! 

""Make Me Feel"" won its rate against Mitski and Kacey, which were basically the three main critic girls of 2018. It was a stacked rate despite the lack of actual hits present, and in this rate it stomped its way into the top 10 and inched slowly and slowly to the #1 spot, where it finally landed. It was always going to do well — I mean, it's Janelle — and even with fellow moderator /u/fishingfor8 deciding to smack her with a 0, it notched a comfortable lead over Lizzo in the end.

The song is fluid sexuality personified, as Janelle coos about how she's merely attracted to the feeling these people imbue in her rather than anything specific physically. It's like if you threw Prince's ""Kiss"" and Little Mix's ""Move"" in a large hadron collider, and when smashed together it resulted in this smooth little bop that erupts in the bridge. This ramp-up in intensity is matched by her orgasmic moans, until it all tumbles down back into its mellow seductive phase. It's a masterclass in displaying carnal desire and the ebb and flow in passion that comes with a great, long sex session, and it's a great representation of how horny we are as a community that we all liked this as much as we did. Congratulations to Janelle for this seminal victory in our little corner of the internet, and thank you all for sticking along for the journey!

**bespectacIed** (10): it would be a shame if this funk-rap-pop masterpiece, made by one of the few mainstream black female pop stars today, were to be reduced into a vapid meme. But we all know that's not gonna happen!

**bigbigbee** (10): Lizzo is the queen of self-love, and this song is the epitome of that. “If I’m shining, everybody gonna shine” makes me feel so good about myself. In the words of a YouTube comment I saw once, “[this song] gives me like, 3 therapy sessions’ worth of self-confidence”.

**CarlieScion** (10): this is gonna win isnt it

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): will phcj stay winning?

**PuggleMaster** (10): I had already began to stan Lizzo when I heard Good As Hell in 2018 (Thanks drag race for introducing me to Lizzo before the GP), but when I heard this I had to immediately submit my stan card. Plus this came out of my birthday! WE HAD TO STAN PLEASE! I really need new Lizzo music back in my life because I MISS HER. LIZZO PLEASE.

**starlitsuns** (9.5): Hot take that is unnecessary since this isn’t /r/popheadscirclejerk, but Damn Daniel is better even though I think this song is one of Lizzo’s better songs.

**bulforster** (9.4): (#6) WE BETTER STILL BE STREAMING!!

**WeastofEden44** (9.4): I can't wait to see the super new, totally not overdone, completely unique ""jokes"" for this

**engifear** (9.2): Stream Juice

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Just gonna tell this story again because I love it so much: I found Lizzo through YouTube after *Coconut Oil* dropped and I was so excited that when I went to rehearsal for the show I was in that night I pulled out my headphones, put them in my friend’s ears, and was like “you have to listen to this” and then played “Good As Hell” and her jaw literally dropped and she looked at me and she said, and I quote, “who is this goddess?” I was so thrilled when “Juice” came out and it got such a positive reception because I was like “this is it, this is the moment she breaks through!” It wasn’t, of course, that moment came later, but it was the moment that the TRUE pop fans finally hopped on the Lizzo train and it’s been such a thrill ride since.

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (9): Lizzo invented high self steem

**kirby31200** (9): I think I'm supposed to recommend you stream something but I can't remember what

**racloves** (9): phcj tease

**seanderlust** (8.6): god this rate is hard lmao. I mean, this is THE self-love anthem. that said, maybe i've just heard it too many times or i've moved onto other lizzo songs? idk either way stream batches n cookies.

**slimboyfriend** (8.4): I’m telling y’all, this song was HUGE in Minnesota

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.3): how many comments will mention phcj

**fadedblue09** (8): It's still good, but it pales in comparison especially when you have actual disco anthems here.

**joshually** (8): this song is super fun but it’s kind of exhausting in general

**vayyiqra** (8): stream juice

**Frelock\_** (7): A fun bop.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.8): I like this fine (& really like the album its from) but I never really got the hype for this specific song the way so many of you did… maybe I’m just a soda drinker

**anothertown** (10): I love Pang

**aresthormars** (10): This is my fave in PANG and it is such a bop. Show me the banana line will forever hit me.

**bbfan132** (10): sick of this but it’s perfect

**bespectacIed** (10): This rate was so much fun. Deserving winner of the rate. Show me the cock!

**bigbigbee** (10): I first heard this about a month ago. So while I missed its “moment”, as a result, I am not even a little bit tired of this song yet, and I’m here to tell anyone complaining about overplay that this song is still just as good as you thought it was back when you first heard it! I promise.

**camerinian** (10): AH-ah, ah-Ah, ah-aH is such a simple and flawless hook I can’t believe it only came into the world a year ago

**CarlieScion** (10): i heard this playing in a mcdonalds once

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): ah ah ah ah ah AH!

**engifear** (10): Show me the banana

**hunnybee12** (10): i've played this a million times and it never gets old

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this song is just so irresistible

**J\_Toe** (10): went from hating the song to loving the song

**ktajlili** (10): show me your banana.

**ManofOranges** (10): It's a really great song, I must admit. I was kind of shocked when Gone lost to this song, but this song absolutely deserved to win. It's got a lot of great things going for it, specifically the huge GASP at the end of the song. I absolutely love that part

**Mudkip1** (10): pop perfection

**plastichaxan** (10): cultural reset

**PuggleMaster** (10): Caroline really snapped on this song, and while I prefer Door this still gets a 10 from me. Show me the banana na na na na.. Lyrical genius

**quinnpsych** (10): My god, what a song. Every time I hear it it's still fresh, definitely one of my most played songs of 2020

**racloves** (10): this song goes so hard

**ReallyCreative** (10): this song is gay rights I shouldn't have to expand on that it should just be understood

**runaway3212** (10): This song is beyond great, it really showcases the best parts of pop music. It on its own could start the second wave of poptimism

**sarcasticsobs** (10): s  h  o  w  m  e  t  h  e  b  a  n  a  n  a

**SmileAndTears** (10): I too am horny Caroline

**steelstepladder** (10): It might be overhyped for a lot of people but it's still great

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): i made my friends listen to this with me once and they said it sounded like straight girl music how am i supposed to tell them that this song’s biggest audience is actually gay men

**twat\_brained** (10): check like Caroline Pola

**waluigiest** (10): this song reconfigured my brain chemistry

**welcometoNY** (10): the song that simultaneously introduced me to Caroline and made me a stan

**pat-rickstar** (9.8): One of the absolute best songs of last year

**InternetDude19** (9.5): Banana

**WillamThunderfuck** (9.5): Such a good tune, the increasingly deep sighs she takes always me feel something.

**slimboyfriend** (9.2): I’m amazed at how much I love this song because there’s not much to it

**WeastofEden44** (9.2): Me going on Grindr and seeing all my unanswered DMs:

**1998tweety** (9): I would give this a higher score if not for the weird bridge. Bops though

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): The fact that Caroline Polacheck WON over the Queen of Popheads Carly Rae Jepsen is a huge fucking shocker. I should finally start listening to her album because this song is FREAKING GOOD.

**fadedblue09** (9): I probably like a couple of songs on Pang better but otherwise a deserving winner.

**raicicle** (9): this has always felt like caroline’s most obvious nod towards her chairlift days and we love that chairlift’s legacy is being respected

**suhonyu** (9): love this banger

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): did you know Caroline filmed this video at the popheads HQ?

**Ionlywanttheworld** (8.8): I listened to this too much and now I don't like it as much :(

**seanderlust** (8.8): ""show me the banana"" LMFAOOO

**RandomHypnotica** (8.7): This isn't even Top 5 from Pang

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): I gave this my eleven when we rated it but time has kinda dulled the shine on it, it’s still good but I find myself visiting it (and Caroline in general) pretty infrequently. It’s fun to see an artist have such a strong sense of humor while still taking their music seriously and the bridge is iconic but I have to be in a really specific mood for this kind of music.

**joshually** (8.5): I find this song to be extremely cute

**jsonphile** (8.5): never heard of this song or the artist but I see why popheads like it

**cremeebrulee** (8): yes this shrunk on me. what about it

**mysario** (8): TIL she's 35

**nooodisaster** (8): dylan o'brien throughout my entire high school career

**plvstvcbvrds** (8): she might be trash, but she knows how to make a song. oh caroline, why did you turn out to suck as a human? anywhos. this song is real gay, and reminds me of the first time i watched a britney spears video and cried because i knew i was gay and i wanted to touch her stomach a lot. it captures a feeling we've all had of yearning and longing and wanting to slap someone because they are so hot it doesn't make any logical sense.

**Roxieloxie** (8): i can vibe with it

**vayyiqra** (8): It's overrated and the banana jokes were never that funny but it's still a bop

**wavingwolves** (8): not like i'm counting the days... but it's been 25 (since i've left my house)

**hikkaru** (7.5): carly was ROBBED!!

**starlitsuns** (7.5): I can’t think of anything that describes my feelings for this song? But it’s nice at the very least.

**bulforster** (7.4): (#16) Extremely relatable

**CrimsonROSET** (7): Remember when Caroline won over Charli and Carly? Shoutouts to her. I wish it was with a better song.

**lIIustration** (7): just too repetitive at times for me, but a great general sound

# https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTTFmWr3UrI

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.8): this is nice but hit me where it hurts is superior

**ImADudeDuh** (6): Probably the most overrated song of 2019

**Frelock\_** (4): By the book melodies and harmonies & lyrics that don't really speak to me.

**moonagenightmares** (3): the ah-ah ah-ah ah-ahs are annoying, also kinda sounds like a boring marina reject. I assume someone else will make a “show me your banana” joke

**ElizabethDDoS** (0): I hesitated to do this in the original rate, but not this time. It's bottom half of the album but somehow it won for being relatable, I guess."

**bbfan132** (10): kanye’s verse is one of the best rap verses in a pop song i’ve ever heard

**bespectacIed** (10): best song ever made

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): YASSS GARNET SLAY DEM VOCALS!!!!

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Somehow I've never heard this song until a year ago or so, and I was totally missing out. Manifesting top 5.

**fishingfor8** (10): always will be a favorite

**frogaranaman** (10): everything about this song is magic

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I blame this song for Kanye running for president.

**lIIustration** (10): WHEN HE SPEAK HIS SUIT BESPOKE

**ManofOranges** (10): This song is just yet another immaculate song, especially in terms of production. Shout out to will.i.am for producing this cause this may honestly be one of the best things he's ever done. Estelle's singing is great, the lyrics are charming, and Kanye's verse is just oh so good. If this song doesn't get far I'm going to be floored

**pat-rickstar** (10): Take me back to when this was popular

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): and it was almost my 11. this song just. man, it takes me back to high school in so many ways. it makes me think of having my headphones in while i helped at the ticket stands during football games, or dancing around while i skipped class with my friends behind the bleachers. i'm revealing my age here, but whatever! this song takes me back.

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): star spangled banner found dead in ditch

**PuggleMaster** (10): LOVE LOVE LOVE this song. Estelle voice blends so beautifully along the beat of the song. I'm so glad that if she had to be a one hit wonder (she deserves more!) it was this song. Even if it features that man on it......

**ReallyCreative** (10): an iconic moment in UK/USA relations

**Roxieloxie** (10): Miss Estelle is an icon.

**runaway3212** (10): I really love Kanye too much.

**skargardin** (10): ICONIC

**slimboyfriend** (10): A contender for the greatest song of the 2000s

**steelstepladder** (10): One of the best songs in the 2000's

**Stryxen** (10): kanye and the uk existing in the same cinematic universe makes this the funniest song ever released and I’m not sure anything will ever beat it

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): hmm best song of the 00’s me thinks? don’t think this is a controversial opinion

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): this is the only song to truly support rights for short men

**wavingwolves** (10): if this doesn't get to top 3 AT LEAST we need to throw the sub away

**worlds-okayest666** (10): what a fucking smash classic

**zadooi** (10): Only good thing to come out of the creation of America.

**TiltControls** (9.7): 100% bop

**jackisboredtoday** (9.2): when my 4th grade classmates choreographed a routine for when they sang along to this at the end of school days… maybe we snapped

**camerinian** (9): This was the favourite song of the two toxic girls I had the misfortune of living with for 6 months and the fact that I can still even listen to it is a testament to how rock solid it is

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): one of the greatest choruses of all time mayhaps

**intheaftermath** (9): reminds me of my Steven Universe fandom days.

**Ionlywanttheworld** (9): Iconic

**J\_Toe** (9): my mom loved this song so much in 2009 she asked to buy it on itunes, even though she never bought anything else and didn't have a music player of her own

**moooo566** (9): The best Kanye song

**mysario** (9): the anti-thesis to the garbage ""London Boy"", thinking about how I could've submitted this for the last charity rate but I took too long to decide

**racloves** (9): I have strong memories as this song came out as I went to America for the first time

**vayyiqra** (9): classic

**waluigiest** (9): This song never gets old. I really love Estelle’s part, but Kanye’s messy verse is what stops this from being a 10

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.3): “don't like his baggy jeans but i might like what's underneath them” iconic

**plastichaxan** (8.3): damn it why can’t i hate this bop

**WeastofEden44** (8.2): The first time I ever heard this song was during my jazz dance class this semester. It's a really fun bop, but I wish it went somewhere a little more.

**akanewasright** (8): If will.i.am of all people can produce this

**anothertown** (8): Yeezy taught me, UK edition- Bespoke, Wags, Ribena

**nooodisaster** (8): She snapped

**SmileAndTears** (8): that synth in the chorus is so fucking ugly oh my god. its a shame cuz the rest of the song is perfect

**starlitsuns** (8): Such a cute duet! I do have to take off a couple of points because we managed to live in the timeline where Kanye tried running for president. Hopefully as I write this (October 7) this doesn’t come back to bite me.

**bulforster** (7): (#18) The only thing I will acknowledge Kanye for, not to take anything away from Estelle who is a queen but his feature really pushes this song over the top.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): This is like, all a song needs to be. The singing is good, the lyrics are fine, the rap verse is good.

**Frelock\_** (7): Really good vocals

**twat\_brained** (7): Garnet made MYRIAD points. The wannabe president... okay I'll give him credit too. But this romanticizes the United States, which we can't have. And ""Mike at his baddest""... does that include the alleged p*do shit? This has really not aged well to me I'm sorry.

**CarlieScion** (5): okay i hosted this rate so i can be salty that everyone loved this but me. especially since my 11 was #2!!!!

**ktajlili** (5): I like the vocals and the Kayne feature, but I really don't like the synth during the chorus and pre-chorus. It's so cacophonous! I also feel like this song's premise is a little simple for a five-minute run time. She wants to travel around the US. And? IDK. I think this could have been a great song with a few changes but for now, it's just OKAY.

**fxsparrow** (4): one verse too long

**MelodramaticLemonade** (1): Those buzzing synths at the chorus are so goddamn awful and atrocious I can't even enjoy the rest of the song

**bulforster** (10): (#3) Pure magic.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): If anyone read my comment about how some songs will get robbed for just being too old? Yeah, I was talking about this one. Let's see how this fares with the general crowd. I'm already sorry.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): The only other acceptable winner other than YBAG. It's legendary for a reason.

**frogaranaman** (10): every day I run up my gay hill and make my silly little deal with God

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (10): i love this nine inch nails cover!

**jsonphile** (10): about a month or two ago I listened to Hounds of Love for the first time, since I really liked this song (the only one I knew from it) and I’d seen people in popheads praise it. After one listen, it became one of my favorite albums, and I’ve listened to it several times since. The album is so good that even this 10/10 song is only my fourth favorite after The Big Sky, Cloudbusting, and Jig of Life

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): she is an icon, she is a legend, and she is the moment

**pat-rickstar** (10): This one is for ~~the boys with the booming system~~ my maths teacher who is a big Kate Bush stan

**raicicle** (10): stream meg myers

**RandomHypnotica** (10): It never fails to astound me just how good Kate Bush is

**skargardin** (10): queen shit

**SmileAndTears** (10): This shit slaps imma need to get into Kate Bush

**steelstepladder** (10): Kate Bush gets a 10

**Stryxen** (10): I’d make a deal with god, and switch up my position with you

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): lorde really wishes

**twat\_brained** (10): God is a woman but I can overlook that this song is high art in audio form

**waluigiest** (10): okay I remember the first time I heard this song I was immediately enamored but I was looking it up later like “song with lyric tearing me asunder?????”

**wavingwolves** (10): this is magic whew!

**WillamThunderfuck** (10): This is just such a cathartic song and I would absolutely not be mad if this won.

**slimboyfriend** (9.9): I wonder if Kate Bush knows she’s an icon among Gen Z/Millennials online

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): she's gonna get robbed lmao

**bigbigbee** (9): What a song!! A lot of artists have used this sound lately, and when I was listening through the playlist for the first time, I assumed that this was a track released in the past few years until I heard her amazing vocals come in. Kate Bush did it first!

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): I hate Stan Twitter so much. Everytime I listen to this song, I think of the Super Bass remix.

**nooodisaster** (9): Kate Bush: ""I was trying to say that, really, a man and a woman can’t understand each other, because we are a man and a woman.""

**starlitsuns** (9): I keep exposing myself during this rate but I haven’t listened to any Kate Bush either. I really like the production, it reminds me of a 1980s new wave song without the added synthpop to it.

**zadooi** (9): Cloudbusting outsold tbh.

**seanderlust** (8.9): i don't know much about her, but i feel like the eighties were not ready for kate bush

**MelodramaticLemonade** (8.5): I will fight to my grave that while this is still a good song, Hounds of Love and The Big Sky are infinitely better than it

**aresthormars** (8): I love the galloping drums like it really showcases she is running up that hill.

**Frelock\_** (8): Good lyrics, interesting music & bonus point for message.

**kirby31200** (8): I am shocked this is from 1985. If I didn't have context, I would've assumed it to be from the past decade.

**fadedblue09** (7.5): I revisited the album recently and while I get why it won (it's the closest thing to a ""bop""), it's far from my favorite. I would've preferred some songs on The Ninth Wave (esp. And Dream of Sheep, The Morning Fog) or even Cloudbusting tbh.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): So now I finally have context for all of the memes my Kate Bush loving mutuals post on tumblr, great! This is a cool idea for a song and it sounds pretty but I wish it had more of a build/climax, for a song about running up a hill it’s pretty flat. Maybe that’s the point and I’m just stupid though.

**ktajlili** (7): maybe this will grow on me, but for now, it's just okay?

**bespectacIed** (6): Okay song, Hounds of Love is so much better imo. We could've been rating Paper Bag right now, the winner of the winners rate

**ManofOranges** (6): I'm sorry Kate Bush stans I really want to be able to see that magic in this song that the rest of y'all see because I see so much reverence for this song (and many other of her songs from Hounds of Love) but it's just not for me!

**moonagenightmares** (6): 70s kate bush >>>>> 80s kate bush

**CarlieScion** (5): just smile and nod

**hikkaru** (5): another returnee grab bag rate another expose of my tastelessness in regards to art pop and classics

**PuggleMaster** (5): The entire time this song was playing all i could think was how i'd rather be listening to the next song in the playlist....

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): im sorry i just think kate bush’s voice is insufferable and ruins any good qualities this song may have

**Roxieloxie** (4): one of my friends is always talking about how kate bush is taking over his life and im not getting it

**plvstvcbvrds** (3): what have i told y'all about this lady and how much i don't like her music. this song is just another example of why i don't like her music. i feel like i'm being yelled at by a theater kid who thinks they are just killing it and won't stop doing the rachel berry lip wobble

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (2): this song smells like stale air and plastic covered furniture

**ImADudeDuh** (1): why is she running? Like damn, god will still be there if you just walk."

**1998tweety** (10): now THIS is one of her best songs ever. The only singular thing I would change is the verses sound a bit weird cause there's a background voice immediately repeating the lines right after the Main Gaga sings them. Now that I've mentioned it you won't be able to unhear it <3 [host note: I think that's just an echo effect]

**addupten** (10): strong contender for my 11

**aresthormars** (10): This is such a beautiful song and I remember this chorus of this song being transcribed in our quiz of Phonetics! I checked this song after that and I will forever love this song!

**astrologicalangel** (10): I wish I could give two 11s

**bbfan132** (10): the production is a glorious mess and the second half is bombastic in the best way possible

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): one of the greatest pop songs of all time PERIOD

**Frelock\_** (10): Past the edge and well into glory.

**frogaranaman** (10): the mixing is a little much but honestly it adds flare to the song for me

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I don’t even need to say anything, if you have ears you know this song is good.

**hikkaru** (10): gaga winning would be really boring and she'll probably have the top 2 but idc this classic is a 10 [2]

**Ionlywanttheworld** (10): the sax solo elevates this song to a ten

**J\_Toe** (10): could honestly get my 11 but the competition is tight

**jsonphile** (10): since I doubt we’ll ever get a Bruce Springsteen rate in this pop sub, this is the closest I guess we’ll get with a sax solo from the Big Man himself, Clarence Clemens. This song is a 9/10 by itself, but the sax solo just elevates it to the next level. Anyway stream Jungleland by Bruce Springsteen

**ManofOranges** (10): This song is just an expression of pure joy and carelessness. I love it so much. I don't see it doing that well though (dreams kind of deserved)

**nooodisaster** (10): One of Gag's most palpable songs, and still one of her greatest.

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): the sax the sax the sax the sax the sax the sax the sax the sax

**PuggleMaster** (10): Y'all didn't have to put two of the best Gaga songs in this rate. If Gaga was gonna pay ARTPOP dust at the Superbowl she could've at least did this song instead of a solo of Telephone.

**shhhneak** (10): is there a colloquial term for an artist’s best song from their best album? We should start referring to it as their Edge of Glory.

**slimboyfriend** (10): Every time I start listening to this song I’m like, “oh, it’s not THAT good.” And then she starts singing and I realize that it is

**SmileAndTears** (10): Her best song that's still available on all streaming platforms

**starlitsuns** (10): This was iconic in 2011 when this song was on the radio and it’s still iconic now.

**static\_int\_husp** (10): always love sax solos in pop songs

**steelstepladder** (10): This is way better than Poker Face come at me

**TiltControls** (10): Still Gaga's best song to date. Everything about this song is perfection

**twat\_brained** (10): RIP Clarence Clemons, your saxophone ability will forever be unparalleled

**waluigiest** (10): I think this is her second best single behind Judas, and I’m amazed at how this took over the radio for an entire summer. It’s the song that exemplifies this era for me, both in terms of sound and lyrics. It’s a beautiful track and I’m just glad it got the public acclaim that it deserved.

**worlds-okayest666** (10): https://twitter.com/findurmeme/status/1210640618206052352

**cocosairdep** (9.5): one of the best singles off Born This Way, and certainly the one that aged the best. It’s definitely one of the highlights in her discography.

**intheaftermath** (9.5): the Glee version of this song is so good though

**suhonyu** (9.5): edging anthem

**WeastofEden44** (9.5): Tbh, I will always consider this song to be a touch overhyped by the fandom, but it's still an impeccable song

**ignitethephoenix** (9.3): Poker Face >> this song so I will rate accordingly (still a great song though).

**akanewasright** (9): A little overindulgent, but like... otherwise basically perfect

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): Iconique.

**fishingfor8** (9): I like this Gaga better than the Poker Face/Bad Romance Gaga

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (9): that saxophone solo saved my life

**ImADudeDuh** (9): this beat Dreams and yet Dreams charted again in 2020, so who really won

**jasannn** (9): Her vocal range on this song is amazing.

**ReallyCreative** (9): I remember this was my least favorite song on BTW for a while but it's grown on me. It's just so cinematic and extra

**succulentils** (9): She sounds so young

**vayyiqra** (9): Beautiful song

**welcometoNY** (9): a stadium-shattering chorus and a god-tier sax solo combine to form what is arguably Gaga's best song

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.8): i love this song and at least half of the reason why is because i still have vivid memories of my year 5 teacher at a catholic primary school showing this music video to 30 nine year olds every morning for 2 weeks when it was released. why? i have no idea but we love her anyway

**bigbigbee** (8.5): I think this song suffers a bit when it’s divorced from its album, because the outro - which is probably cathartic in the context of listening to the Born This Way album - can feel a tiny bit overlong when just listening to this track. That being said, when I got used to the outro I couldn’t imagine listening to the song without it. The melody is just chefs kiss.

**joshually** (8): the ending is a bit long but man, this is a great song at the words part

**kirby31200** (8): Not in my BTW top 5 tbh

**runaway3212** (8): This has always felt like one of gaga's weaker singles imo

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): one time i was listening to this song with friends and they said this https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/747680248199381097/774468109003653120/image0.png it’s ok gaga i still like this song </3

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): I need more details on how to define the threshold of glory and what is considered the edge

**bulforster** (7.8): (#14) If you slap a saxophone on pretty much any song I'm sold, doesn’t hurt this sax is legendary.

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Euphoric chorus, but somehow hearing it in full feels… kinda whelming. Oh well, if Gaga wins I hope it's with this song.

**Stryxen** (7.5): I did not know this was a lady gaga song until embarrassingly recently

**anothertown** (7): The Glee version performed by the Troubletones outpeaked

**wavingwolves** (7): this winning a rate is actually a little surprising to me

# On the Edge of Getting Doxxed

**CrimsonROSET** (6.8): Of course the song for the Gays is about edging.

**RandomHypnotica** (6.7): The Edge of Boring

**engifear** (6.6): I still think that sax solo absolutely kills the momentum and I don't understand why so many people like it.

**CarlieScion** (6.5): the way i like the production in the glee cover more than i like the original

**bespectacIed** (6): Gaga's vocals so fucking beautiful here but the song aged exactly how a 2011 electropop song would

**mysario** (4): the sax solo is all 4 of these points

**moonagenightmares** (3.3): overrated as hell

**Awkward\_King** (2): one of my other least favourite gaga songs damn y'all really chose my least two favourite gaga singles as rate winners huh

**Roxieloxie** (2): why did this win over You and I

**1998tweety** (10): absolutely iconic, we love a gay icon

**bbfan132** (10): a disco classic that will be screwed over here

**camerinian** (10): 10 is also the age I was when I did a flawless lip sync of this at my Christian summer camp and no doubt caused a sea of homosexual awakening amongst the other church-going queers

**CarlieScion** (10): bop but blondie deserved

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): I'm still alive, thankfully.

**fadedblue09** (10): As much as I feel indifferent towards disco, I'm glad this won, as it works well as an anti-oppression anthem (and isn't that what disco is all about?).

**frogaranaman** (10): timeless bop

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (10): if you haven't dramatically karaoked this song don't even look at me

**ignitethephoenix** (10): cured all my ailments

**ImADudeDuh** (10): the disco rate was honestly some of the most fun i’ve had on popheads

**lIIustration** (10): Close to getting my 11, I hope this song survives

**ManofOranges** (10): Still kind of sad that Donna Summer lost the Disco Rate, although this song definitely is a deserving winner I will give it that

**pat-rickstar** (10): Some people were so bitter about this winning the disco rate lol, I hope it does well here too

**PuggleMaster** (10): Justice for miss Gaynor after those 2 drag queens absolutely ruined the lip sync to this song. Also this song has basically been me this entire year.

**quinnpsych** (10): And don't you forget that this song is the blueprint, she is the moment

**runaway3212** (10): The Hermes House Band version is a 12, but this is fine too.

**skargardin** (10): iconic

**SmileAndTears** (10): I remember being obsessed with this song before I knew I was gay

**starlitsuns** (10): Disco perfection. That’s all I have to say.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): rasputin should have won the disco rate but this is still a banger so i can’t complain

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): this is secretly my best karaoke song

**twat\_brained** (10): Can we do this rate again with covers so we can give Miley's ""Heart of Glass"" cover the win? Then again that might mean we'd have to hear the Pussycat Dolls' trying to fix what wasn't broke so please ignore this comment.

**welcometoNY** (10): truly one of the greatest songs of all time, a timeless anthem for sure

**WillamThunderfuck** (9.9): Iconic gay enthem, but not a 10 bc I'm bitter about it winning the disco rate

**jsonphile** (9.5): several years ago on Thanksgiving my aunt sent my family an e-card that had a turkey singing a parody of this song about how she would survive being eaten on Thanksgiving and I think about that a lot

**kappyko** (9.5): rpdr conditioned me into thinking this was bad because of that awful lip sync and karaoke did not help but now that i sit down with it.... queen.

**aresthormars** (9): You can never go wrong with D I S C O. But this is such a great song! I will associate this song to Hush Hush by Pussycat Dolls and parody of a band in our country named Parokya Ni Edgar which is called Picha Pie.

**cocosairdep** (9): I just rated this an 11 in the Disco Rate, but now I really need my faves to win. Sorry Gloria :(

**Frelock\_** (9): An anthem for strong independent singles everywhere

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): ICONIC!!

**nooodisaster** (9): Okay but can they re-do this song on Drag Race already?

**Roxieloxie** (9): Is this a good song, yes, however It should not have won over September

**selegend** (9): iconic

**Stryxen** (9): good for her

**waluigiest** (9): a huge display of gay rights. I heard this at age 10 and KNEW

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.6): me @ myself every day of the pandemic

**seanderlust** (8.5): hot take alert! I think this one actually deserved to win the disco rate. donna summer is the queen of disco, yes, but the impact this one has. everyone in the western world knows this song, and for good reason. it's in the library of congress and, of equal importance, in this rate.

**mysario** (8.3): Cake version still outsold

**Ionlywanttheworld** (8): Drag Race ruined this song for me imo

**racloves** (8): corona mood

**suhonyu** (8): iconic karaoke banger

**WeastofEden44** (7.8): Remember when Laila and Dax wearily spun into each other?

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): a Donna Summer song should be here but y'all have no taste

**TiltControls** (7.2): We should have been rating Donna Summer here. Still it's iconic, but after so many years of overplay it does drain on you a little (still good though)

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): This is iconic and I would say that I like it but I don’t know, it’s one of those songs where the more I dig into the genre that spawned it the more the shine wears off for me. Like when this is the only disco song you know it’ll make you lose your mind but once you actually listen to some Diana Ross and Donna Summer it just kinda becomes another hit on the list. I’m also still kinda bothered by the tempo of this song because you can’t quite dance to it but it’s not a ballad so I’m unsure how my body is supposed to respond.

**wavingwolves** (7): gay!

# Did Not Survive the Lip Sync

**bluehxrizon** (6): dax exclamationpoint is shaking

**steelstepladder** (6): Weak against the field.

**vayyiqra** (6): I'm tired of this song but it's a classic

**CrimsonROSET** (4): Scoring on a curve is hard for songs like this, where it's normally a 7, but in this context, it's a 4, because I'm giving 10s my 7s. Does that make sense?

**joshually** (4): “Great chorus, terrible verses” – admitted everything drunk girl at karaoke after bombing on stage with this song

**bulforster** (3): (#38) Donna was robbed.

**MelodramaticLemonade** (3): Y'all complain when pop stars recycle their material to make hits, but when literally a line of melody gets looped endlessly to eternity the song suddenly becomes a classic? Get your standards right"

**bbfan132** (10): yes she’s singing off the beat during the chorus but that lowkey makes this better imo

**CarlieScion** (10): middle school bop

**cocosairdep** (10): This, together with Toxic, is te best pop song of the early 2000s.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): I mean, duh. I don't know if it's top 5 Beyoncé tracks, but I can see the appeal.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): WHAT a ""debut"" single, honestly.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): classic, those trumpets are so iconic

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/justdance/images/1/15/Crazyinlove_gm_1.gif

**joshually** (10): so iconic. The perfect way to mark your solo debut

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): honestly this is one of those songs you just have to sing along to

**moooo566** (10): beyonce peaked here

**mysario** (10): peak artistry before they took (more of) the money

**pat-rickstar** (10): Still holds up, one of her best singles ever

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): you love to hate her, popheads but even you have to admit that this song is amazing. it's a classic for a reason, and we all spent way too many hours trying to learn the uh oh dance with oprah.

**PuggleMaster** (10): [What a song to kickstart your solo career on. This is the reason Beyonce is a legend.](https://youtu.be/7RPFuJWc-B4?t=16)

**raicicle** (10): a cultural reset but actually

**ReallyCreative** (10): holding out hope this doesn't get robbed... the absolute RESET of my brain chemistry when those trumpets come on

**Roxieloxie** (10): Isnt it crazy how the only line that dates this is the line about paging

**runaway3212** (10): This song got me into both rap en Beyonce

**starlitsuns** (10): I feel bad for Feeling Myself not gaining redemption in the Redemption Rate, so here’s to Queen Bey potentially winning this rate.

**succulentils** (10): Never really noticed the harmony that comes in towards the end of the chorus

**twat\_brained** (10): less Single Ladies and Run The World, this is the definitive Beyoncé lead single. Also helps this is one of Jay's best verses, it's almost enough to make me overlook the perturbing factor of their age gap

**wavingwolves** (10): ugh!!!!!! so GOOD

**WillamThunderfuck** (10): As soon as the music starts I get ready to turn it. the. fuck. up!

**fadedblue09** (9.5): There is something here that holds me back from giving this a 10 (and no, it's not Jay-Z), but otherwise deserves to place high in the rate.

**kirby31200** (9.5): Chinchilla fur? Don't tell PETA

**wanderingimpromptu3** (9.5): An almost perfect song

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): Whoever is giving this classic less than 8 is ugly. Sorry, I don't make the rules bestie! 💋

**jasannn** (9): One hell of a solo debut.

**lIIustration** (9): Too loud at times, but just a great song that always gets me feeling pumped.

**nooodisaster** (9): A modern classic yup yup.

**skargardin** (9): classic

**Stryxen** (9): this makes me go feral idk why

**waluigiest** (9): a perfect song. The opener of every bey concert for centuries to come. The vocals are unhinged. If only it were mixed well......

**WeastofEden44** (9): ""It was iconic, it was iconic""

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.7): deja vu outsold

**engifear** (8.7): Maybe it's the nostalgia for my childhood, but this song is a jam.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.7): When I did my tragically ignored [Playlist for the End of the World thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/gwni9a/a_playlist_for_the_end_of_the_world_what_would/) and asked people what songs they would save if humanity was about to be destroyed, like three different people said this song because it’s just that damn good. It loses some points for me because the go-go influenced production (hi Amerie) and some of the lyrics are very clearly dated, but you can’t keep a good song down! I also love the version from the *Fifty Shades* films, it’s always cool when a song can work equally well as both an uptempo dance jam and a searing ballad.

**1998tweety** (8.5): bop

**camerinian** (8.5): playing this song through my podcast app so I can hit +30 on Jay Z's verse

**Ionlywanttheworld** (8.5): iconic but not my favorite Beyoncé song

**shhhneak** (8.5): My goal is to have as ass so big it vibrates like a door spring stopper when I stomp to this intro.

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): Idk if its her vocals, the mixing or both but something feels off

**InfernalSolstice** (8): jay kinda drags it down but solo bey would be an easy 10

**moonagenightmares** (8): jay-z ruins it

**steelstepladder** (8): Lemonade era Bey towers over all other eras of Bey don't @ me

**suhonyu** (8): so much nostalgia with this one, my cousins and I performed a whole dance piece to this sawng

**vayyiqra** (8): The horn riff is so catchy we can ignore how weak the verses are

**MelodramaticLemonade** (7.5): That slightly off beat and Jay Z's verse kill the song, but otherwise it's such a glorious hook

**seanderlust** (7.3): okay...beyhive, don't @ me. this is a good song. it's not a great beyonce song, it's just the first beyonce song. that said, the 50 shades version slaps hard.

**akanewasright** (7): The chorus drives me a little crazy, but this song is rightfully iconic.

**Frelock\_** (7): Fun dance tune.

**joeeswift** (7): the homecoming version>>

**quinnpsych** (7): Good strutting song

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): if Beyoncé can just kick open a fire hydrant she has the strength of multiple fireman

**zadooi** (7): Never understood the amount of praise this song gets. It's alright, but nothing too special.

# Bitter Ashanti Stans

**plastichaxan** (6.8): It feels wrong to give Beyoncé less than seven but this song is...not my favorite

**fxsparrow** (6): I find this song chaotic and while the horn riffs are good they are all over the place.Thats why I prefer the remix made for 50 shades, it's miles better.

**hikkaru** (6): i know it's iconique but tbh not one of my fave bey songs

**ManofOranges** (6): I know a lot of people love this song a lot but it's not even close to being my favorite anything. People especially love to talk about the trumpets but, in my opinion, they're the worst part of this song by a mile

**bulforster** (4.8): (#29) Iconic debut single but it's a bit messy (especially Jay-Z's feature) and not as dynamic as it could be, Bey has gone on to do much better.

**1998tweety** (10): Iconic gay bop even though Get Outta My Way should've won the rate

**addupten** (10): pure pop perfection

**akanewasright** (10): Literally a perfect song.

**bbfan132** (10): that was a classic, that was a classic

**bulforster** (10): (#2) The ultimate sad banger, invented crying in the club.

**camerinian** (10): FUCK Calum Scott, all my homos HATE Calum Scott

**CarlieScion** (10): this is great but also if it wins im gonna be so dissapointed

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): thinking about experiencing this live... one of the greatest nights in my LIFE

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): If there is one thing I liked about HBO's Girls, it's discovering this song. I never knew the lyrics would actually hit me until I actually went to college. Feeling so alone while most of my friends were hanging out without me is the worst. Sometimes I would decline, sometimes I wasn't even allowed to, and sometimes they just don't invite me. It feels like my sadness is interpreted as bitter to my friends because of that. Sigh, sophomore year was not a great year for me for sure.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): GOMW lost but I can't not give this a 10 under any circumstances.

**fadedblue09** (10): You know a song is objectively good when people who don't care about club music (e.g. myself) are somehow emotionally moved by it.

**frogaranaman** (10): iconic and lovely

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): One of the Pandora stations at my work has a dance remix of the Callum Hood version of this song in its rotation and I’m like wow… a dance version of “Dancing On My Own?” Imagine that. If only someone had thought to record that. :/ Anyways this is an eternal dance floor classic, sacred to the gays, the holy grail of poptimism, yada yada y’all know the drill at this point.

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (10): every time I listen to this song I remember the video where a crowd, who just left Robyn's concert, began to sing this on the subway platform and I think wow... It's a very complex emotion

**ignitethephoenix** (10): classic sad bop

**ImADudeDuh** (10): One of the greatest songs ever made. My 2nd most scrobbled song ever.

**InfernalSolstice** (10): second choice 11

**joshually** (10): perfection. Pure perfection

**ktajlili** (10): this and call your girlfriend chiefs kiss

**lIIustration** (10): still haven’t forgiven Callum Scott

**ManofOranges** (10): Gave it my 11 once before and I'm honestly thinking about doing it again. This is one of those songs that's just greatness in every way. And it really goes to show how good this song is that, in a rate as stacked as the one this was one, this came out as the winner with a near-10 average.

**Mudkip1** (10): pop perfection

**nootnoot781** (10): calum scott needs to be tried at the hague for his cover. full on war crime

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): amazing. excellent. makes me sad but in a good way. great drunken dancing music.

**ReallyCreative** (10): this song is just excellence from the top down, making you feel the most devastating emotions while dancing your bussy off

**runaway3212** (10): Sometimes p4k really says it best: ""At its core, the song is an exploration of contradictions: between the mechanized backbeat and Robyn’s all-too-human vocals; between a dancefloor’s collective catharsis and the isolation of being trapped inside your own skin; between the despair of the heart and the resilience of the body."" –Ryan Dombal

**seanderlust** (10): the power of the lines ""stilettos and broken bottles/i'm spinning around in circles"". this was one of three contenders for my 11.

**shhhneak** (10): A perfect song. Calum Scott’s version being more famous with the locals is a crime.

**skargardin** (10): I hardly know a better song, seeing this live is a moment that will never be topped. absolutely euphoric

**slimboyfriend** (10): Remember when this song was in a rate against Bionic lol

**steelstepladder** (10): I mean duh

**TragicKingdom1** (10): call your girlfriend >>

**twat\_brained** (10): ooh… it's gonna be hard to argue against this winning but like, what's its competition? Mariah? ABBA perhaps? It didn't win the first Charity Rate so I won't expect it to do the same here but I anticipate it'll still be top 10

**vayyiqra** (10): crying on the dancefloor bop blah blah

**waluigiest** (10): This song inspired my “crying at the club” playlist and CONTINUES to be an exemplar for the genre

**welcometoNY** (10): love my scream-crying synthpop anthems

**WillamThunderfuck** (10): I want to break up with someone so I can listen to this and cry

**aresthormars** (9): I love this Calum Scott cover! /s

**jsonphile** (9): second best song on the list that’s got really sad lyrics but fantastic to dance to

**SmileAndTears** (9): Your Type outsold

**Stryxen** (9): this was my cry dance song until so hot youre hurting my feelings came out love you tho girl this goes so hard

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): is this song a banger and a half? hell yes it is. do i think it’s worthy of being considered one of the greatest songs of the 2010’s? not really.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): no one: ... absolutely no one: ... every decade end list from an indie rock publication: OH IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE! TURN IT UP!

**worlds-okayest666** (9): this would be a ten if it was the album version but the radio edit just feels a bit too cheap in comparison. with that being said, im not gonna dock off too many point bc like...its still dancing on my own. its still a total serve

**WeastofEden44** (8.6): Call Your Girlfriend is better ❤️

**fishingfor8** (8.5): speaking of the Calum Scott cover, has anyone ever noticed how the chords are wrong and just plain don't sound right?

**suhonyu** (8.5): insert juju and raven lipsync here

**CrimsonROSET** (8): Social distance, yadda yadda.

**Frelock\_** (8): A sad song with an upbeat tune: all I ever wanted.

**zadooi** (8): Overrated to me, but still pretty good.

**aestheticen** (7.5): Calum Scott outcharted and outsold this flop!

**anothertown** (7): wtf is this version?? This mix is so much weaker than the Body Talk Pt 1 version that I guess is the one I’ve been listening to for the past 10years lol..?

**kirby31200** (7): Never understood the cult following. It's pretty good but I don't know about song of the decade. I guess you just had to be there?

# Kylie Minogue - Get Outta My Rate

**J\_Toe** (6): still don't like it but I can't say that without getting crucified by the subreddit

**cremeebrulee** (5): overrated

**fxsparrow** (5): i think am the only one in popheads who like calcium Salt's version more

**outsideeyess** (3.8): Don't kill me

**selegend** (2): i honestly never cared for this song .. call your girlfriend >>>>>

**bespectacIed** (1): a song so overrated by a niche group of people that a then-closeted gay man had to straight-ify it to give it relevance with the GP

**Roxieloxie**, trying to make more people delete their accounts (1): its just not a very good song

**PuggleMaster** (0): I seriously never got the hype for this song. Ever gay always hypes it up like it's some masterpiece, but in my opinion it's so meh and same-y. I guess the gays love it because they're depressed.

**RandomHypnotica** (0): I have tried for years to understand this song. Truly. But I just really, really, REALLY don't get the appeal. It feels like I'm in a circlejerk with people saying ""ThE SoNg SoUnDs HaPpY, bUt ThE LyRiCs ArE sAd"" like it's the most creative concept in all of music. The instrumental is repetitive and droning, Robyn's vocal performance feels lackluster, and while i appreciate the lyricism of the song, it just bores me to tears actually listening to it."

**1998tweety** (10): Absolutely iconic, gonna be sad to see our highest rated song of all time get robbed here

**bbfan132** (10): deserves a 10+ average again

**bespectacIed** (10): One of my favorite rates ever. Four legendary pop albums from a decade that we all demand our modern pop girls to be inspired of, then this sub had the audacity for the low turnout!!!! Can't wait for Whitney to snatch her own record average on the new 80s rate

**CarlieScion** (10): how can u not love this!!!!

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): how iconic would it be for this to get over a 10 average AGAIN

**CrimsonROSET** (10): Fucking classic. Highest ever average better come through.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): I wonder how the recent ""cancellation"" of Manila Luzon will affect the scores for this.

**fadedblue09** (10): Can't wait for Whitney Houston to sweep both of this month's rates!

**hunnybee12** (10): one of the greatest songs recorded in human history yes

**ignitethephoenix** (10): an underrated song in her discog, deserved to have a 10+ score in the first rate (watch as it barely has over 8 this time because people are tasteless)

**ImADudeDuh** (10): the highest rated song ever going out at #12….. tragic.

**InternetDude19** (10): This is why I love pop music.

**jackisboredtoday** (10): Instant classic from the first notes, plus how iconic would it be if this got another blowout win

**joshually** (10): pop 80s perfection

**ManofOranges** (10): Pure 80s euphoria at its best. Nobody did it or ever will do it like Whitney did.

**nootnoot781** (10): any other score (bar an 11) is a choice

**pat-rickstar** (10): Did somebody say pop perfection?

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): a classic. a bop. a song of the ages. it's both cleaning music and drunk music, which is a rare crossover. i want to put on a jean jacket and some too tight leather pants and a red lip and go dancing with my baby.

**PuggleMaster** (10): MISS WHITNEY! SHE IS SUCH A LEGEND! THIS SONG IS SO ICONIC I WOULDN'T BE MAD IF IT WON!

**runaway3212** (10): Sorry this isn't an 11 miss Houston, forgive me plz.

**sarcasticsobs** (10): don’t understand why weddings only play “i wanna dance with somebody (who loves me)”, these 2 songs should come in a pair

**seanderlust** (10): transcendent

**selegend** (10): this deserves to win honestly

**skargardin** (10): please discard any ballot who gives this less than a ten thank you

**SmileAndTears** (10): This song just makes me happy. Whitney had that capacity to infuse a song with happiness even when the lyrics were teeny and dumb as hell.

**suhonyu** (10): my mom was stanned her so hard, so naturally I adore her so much

**TiltControls** (10): I hope the highest average doesn't cause people to underrate this. It's one of the best pop songs of all time and deserves respect

**waluigiest** (10): I will never be over how perfect this song is

**wavingwolves** (10): yeah this is great

**welcometoNY** (10): this song obviously isn't underrated in the traditional sense, but i feel like it does get overshadowed by I Will Always Love You despite being miles better

**WillamThunderfuck** (10): the drama!

**jsonphile** (9.5): not sure it deserves to be the highest rated song by popheads ever, but it is a total bop

**mysario** (9.5): saxy

**Stryxen** (9.5): every part of this song is the best part

**aresthormars** (9): Whitney is such a queen for dance 80s songs! ""Don't trust your feelings, love can be deceiving"" those lines are solid advice.

**bigbigbee** (9): So youthful and beautiful and lovely. I miss having a crush.

**Frelock\_** (9): Classic 80s from an icon of the era.

**WeastofEden44** (9): Better than I Wanna Dance With Somebody I said what I said

**twat\_brained** (8.7): When you've heard ""I Wanna Dance With Somebody"" no other Whitney song compares. ""I Will Always Love You"" is a Dolly song so don't try that with me

**bulforster** (8.4): (#11) Whitney has a real claim to being the best singles artist of all time.

**nooodisaster** (8): The cover of this album was so boring that for years I just assumed there couldn't be a banger on here and yet.. here we are.

**steelstepladder** (8): It's really good but a tad overrated

**vayyiqra** (8): :kimbryell2:

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): the chorus is literally just that one game you play with flower petals

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I’m grading on a curve here and if we’re being honest I don’t really enjoy this song compared to most of the songs here. It’s good, yes, but it’s not the Whitney song I reach for when I have an itch I need to scratch.

# Even the sole negative comment praises her! Whitney's power!

**moonagenightmares** (1): they really gave her the lamest songs expecting her voice to hard carry"
4202,2020-11-29 21:52:23,k3f0ls,"# Good Citizens of /r/popheads

**anothertown** (10): It makes me indescribably sad to hear this album because Prince isn’t around anymore!!! Lol!!

**aresthormars** (10): I love the Prince influence. And Prince has a hand in production so for sure this is Prince approved.

**bespectacIed** (10): Loved the npr rate so much. Probably the rate that had the closest level of quality between the albums. Make Me Feel deserved an 11.000 average, this song lights up fireworks inside my brain

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): i think of her grammy performance of this like once a day minimum

**CrimsonROSET** (10): Do I have to explain?

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): I remember being so hyped for the release, especially with how much I loved Electric Lady and ArchAndroid. Gosh, the day when she released this song is so iconic. Popheads was fucking floored by this bop. I just wish this song was much more popular in the charts, but at least we got that iconic Grammys performance! /u/JanelleMonae we luv you kween!

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): In the words of the great princesscracker: Shea wins.

**frogaranaman** (10): hi mod

**ignitethephoenix** (10): perfection

**ImADudeDuh** (10): If i wasn’t on the M11 Channel Theme train, this probably would be my 11.

**kirby31200** (10): This song might be perfect

**ManofOranges** (10): Now THIS is a winner right here. Janelle Monae is doing it right here right now. Out of all the songs in this rate, this is another one that I wouldn't mind winning because it's just oh so good. From that NPR Rate with so many good songs and also Mitski's songs, this was always the most deserving winner and I hope it gets paid more than dust here

**mysario** (10): this is Prince-lite

**pat-rickstar** (10): This makes me feel so powerful and sexy

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): this song goes slap the fuck off, it's gay as hell, and the video made me at least five percent gayer than i already was. janelle in this video made me realize the limit to my gayness does not exist, ok

**PuggleMaster** (10): /u/janellemonae you snapped so hard on this song. I'm so proud to have picked this song as my 11 in it's original rate. Dirty Computer really was the best album of 2018 (She was robbed at the grammys).

**quinnpsych** (10): Honestly such a BOP

**racloves** (10): this was the first Janelle song I heard and fell in love instantly

**Roxieloxie** (10): Bisexual Anthem of the century

**runaway3212** (10): Our secret mod with an eternal bop

**selegend** (10): this has gotten even better with time

**skargardin** (10): mother

**static\_int\_husp** (10): pansexual anthem

**steelstepladder** (10): The closest we will ever get to new Prince :/

**Stryxen** (10): she really released the best two songs (this+Django Jane) of the decade at the same time

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): r/popheads’ mod snapped!

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): can janelle do the rate

**TiltControls** (10): if we let this win will Janelle pay us a visit again?

**twat\_brained** (10): I think it'll be either this or a Mariah song that wins. Also, I suggest we all start calling Janelle ""Princess"" since she's basically already succeeded him.

**urlocalcracchead** (10): Another strong contender for the eleven

**vayyiqra** (10): The best Prince song that's not by Prince ever

**waluigiest** (10): the beat is wet beyond belief!!!!

**seanderlust** (9.7): TIL julia michaels did backing vocals and prince played the synth!

**bulforster** (9.6): (#5) Our mod did that!!

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.6): bi rights

**1998tweety** (9.5): iconic bop

**jsonphile** (9.5): no one will ever be Prince, a one of a kind performer. But Janelle is probably the closest we’ll get, and I am okay with that.

**nooodisaster** (9.5): ""Hi R slash popheads! It's your maybe secret mod, Janelle Monae. I released my masterpiece Dirty Computer AND smash single Make Me Feel. If you rate it less than a 9, you're tasteless.""

**SmileAndTears** (9.5): This sounds like a future classic

**WeastofEden44** (9.4): This is her Boom Clap, as in the one song in her actual discography that locals may know, and I'm at peace with that.

**addupten** (9): she very much did that

**akanewasright** (9): Queen Janelle

**bbfan132** (9): honestly i overplayed this and it’s grown off me a bit but it’s still a bop

**camerinian** (9): this isn’t even top 5 songs on Dirty Computer, and yet it was still my most listened to song in 2018 somehow

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Still thinking about how *Antebellum (2020)* made me feel, which was frustrated.

**Ionlywanttheworld** (9): again I'm a sucker for a baseline

**raicicle** (9): i wouldn’t call it janelle’s magnum opus but its impressive that even a song as obviously a commercial play like this ends up being this good, the spirit of prince does flow through her

**succulentils** (9): I strongly believe that Shea should not have done the robot while lip syncing to this, since Janelle Monae said that with Dirty Computer she was no longer hiding behind her android Cindy character

**suhonyu** (9): if this would pink this woulda been higher

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9): how many times have we all collectively said this song is good now like... we know

**zadooi** (9): Invented being bisexual.

**CarlieScion** (8): sexy, but the high to low part of the pre-chorus makes me wanna die

**fadedblue09** (8): I really wished I liked Dirty Computer more but otherwise this is a slick, well-produced bop.

**Frelock\_** (8): I like the way this makes me feel

**joshually** (8): love this prince rip off!!!

**starlitsuns** (8): Another artist I haven’t listened to, I really need to get into Janelle’s discography.

**wavingwolves** (8): damn this is a riot of a song

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): Screwed is still so much better than this and I'm still upset that this beat out High Horse and Nobody. It's a good song but it SCREWED Screwed!!!

**welcometoNY** (7.5): i finally got the hype for this song after dancing to it. it's still average for just a casual listen, but there are very few songs that lend themselves to movement quite as well as this song does.

**sandyfishnets** (7): I can imagine Prince singing this song

**moonagenightmares** (5.8): can’t stand the tongue popping sorry janelle love your voice tho

# What are you gonna do with that big zero? Gonna hit me? Better make it count. Better make it hurt. Better kill me in one shot.

**fishingfor8** (0): this beat is very annoying and there's maybe one vocal melody I like."
4203,2020-11-29 21:57:04,k3f0ls,Screwed deserved but at the same time the 6th best on Dirty Computer is better than the 1st best on almost anyone else's album

> Did Damn Daniel deserve to win? Yes. Is Damn Daniel the better song? Yes. Should you drop everything and stan Bree Runway immediately? Yes. But also, is Boss Bitch an absolute banger deserving of your 10’s? YES. Despite being a soundtrack song, it remains one of Doja’s strongest outings. It’s a perfect banger for the clubs (a sore spot of 2020) with its electrifying, anthemic chorus. Her flow is absolutely infectious, and you can’t help but sing along and scream “DROP!” with Doja on every listen. The only complaint I can possibly think of for this song: it’s quite short! I hope Doja taps more into this sound and style in the future. - /u/DaHumanTorch

""Boss Bitch"" should've been nothing. For starters, it was released as the third single from a soundtrack to a movie that maybe like eight people here have seen — yes, the *Birds of Prey* soundtrack people thought that a song with Normani and a song by Charloette Lawrence (who???) needed to take precedence. And the song itself feels rather disposable; it's two-and-a-half minutes long, with two verses, a two-line chorus and a whole lot of squawking in the last thirty seconds. It then charted at the magical position of #100 on the Hot 100 and should've vanished into the ether.

But instead, ""Boss Bitch"" escaped to the land of TikTok and Twitter fancams, literally ingraining itself in stan culture and, as though through sheer exposure, endeared this little throwaway track further to us gays. And while the song itself can't help but feel like a pointless little throwaway thing, it's Doja herself that makes it memorable and worthwhile. The sheer explosion of personality that she exhibits, especially in that second verse, is proof of her charisma as a pop performer. Despite the many (many, many) setbacks that have been thrown her way, Doja remains a charming staple in the current pop zeitgeist, and the fact that she turned this song to gold is evidence that she deserves to be."

> I don't know where you are right now. You're likely mad that this song won or that it got so far that it had a chance of winning in the first place (I would be pleasantly surprised if this didn't age well). It's impressive how a song that received zero negative comments and a lowest score of merely two 5s in its original rate earns so much ire. It's a hidden and much-coveted reward in and of itself; we're in such unanimous agreement that something is really good that we just want some underdog to beat it because it would be interesting. But would it be correct? Well yes, actually, but let's put that aside.

> Compare this song to ""Just Dance"", the previously released Normal song from the era. Both songs play like robotic, glitzy club hits, yet ""Poker Face"" carries that big Statement in my eyes. No, I'm not talking about the allusions to bisexuality (which is much appreciated), but you can hear in that dark and cavernous intro alone the makings of a true pop star. It's like an invitation to get a glimpse at the next big thing as she makes yet another stunning entrance. On the side, we also have RedOne finding the peak of his sound (foreshadowing ""Bad Romance""), so that's a bonus. - /u/ExtraEater 

 > I am very upset I am not writing a blurb on the iconic Disturbia. Poker Face is fine. Ehhh. It's alright. Like outside of ""Poke her face"" jokes and giving casino scenes in tv/movies a new song to play, Poker Face has not given much to us. Society has advanced passed the need for Poker Face. Stream Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded. - /u/ImADudeDuh

---

Y'all know this song. Do I really have to say anything about it? Okay, here: ""Poker Face"" is the reason Lady Gaga is the star she is today. No it's not the only reason, but the success of this electropop excellence is what solidified her as a global force, and everything else that's followed in her career can be traced back to here. It's the sound of 2009 (making it a worthy winner of its rate, admittedly), the sound of a club at peak hours, the sound of a 5'2 pop star stomping her stiletto on the floor and saying, ""I'm here."" It's one of the reasons I'm gay, tbh.

""Poker Face"" was released as the second single to Lady Gaga's debut album, *The Fame*. After the success of ""Just Dance,"" her newfound audience was ready for more, and they gobbled up this song readily. It rather infamously only god a single week at #1, though — apparently Interscope had to step in and remove ""Right Round"" from iTunes to get it there, and that somehow wouldn't be the first time Kesha would cockblock her! But it was a massive, career-defining moment for the current Amazon makeup lady, and if anything should've gotten a teensy bit higher."

> Of all the rates I've hosted, this one was the most obvious winner. It's just too powerful. During the entirety of the rating period this song did not once leave #1 and honestly it's what it deserves. Nothing can compare to the sweaty, horny bop this is and it's also not a surprise that it is currently among the songs with the most 11s received ever. Since first hearing this song my nipples have been rock hard and I am forever ready 2 go. - /u/hikkaru 

 > This song completely STOMPED the other songs in the Electroflops rate and let's be real...it's easy to see why. It's quintessential Tove; dark, sweaty, sexy, and a banger in every sense of the word. As a host, it was admittedly boring to watch it never move from the #1 spot throughout the entire process, but I couldn't complain much because I knew it absolutely deserved. It's iconic. It's the moment. Get into it. - /u/worlds-okayest666

---

I wasn't too surprised when this song won its rate, but I was surprised to see that THIRTY PEOPLE slapped it with an 11 and hailed Tove Lo as their horny queen. And the thing about Tove is that she's always been horny — my second ever concert was for Tove's theater tour in support of *Queen of the Clouds*, and I of course remember when she flashed us during ""Talking Body"". But while she's always been horny, ""Disco Tits"" was her first time at being super explicitly raunchy in a way that was meant to be campy, fun, and still titillating. Stuff like ""Cool Girl"" was about the stoicism that hid her carnal desires, or like the aforementioned ""Talking Body"" that said they could only fuck for life if they really loved each other.

""Disco Tits"" was a turning point, as she turned the sex thing up to 11 and just looked to see where it took her. In retrospect I understand why this song was so well loved by so many people — just look at how people still give Slayyyter a career — but a part of me will still always prefer the sadder, more reserved, but still extremely horny Tove that I discovered in 2013. But we'll get to that version of her later...

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (11): It's time to accept the truth, disco tits is the best song in this rate. Show me another song that manages to capture slutiness, high energy party and complete insanity in 3 minutes 43 seconds. You can't, I rest my case.

**hikkaru** (11): if you give this a 0 you hate women expressing their sexuality

**kirby31200** (11): I don't know if this is actually the best song here grouped with all these classics but I've been absolutely addicted to it the past week. My nipples will never be soft again"

> ‘Russian Roulette’ is a somewhat unlikely winner for the sub’s K-pop rate. It doesn’t quintessentially play into either the Red or Velvet concepts that Red Velvet had been cultivating up to that point, nor does it have the same Western pop bravado that other K-pop acts like BLACKPINK deal in. Instead what Red Velvet serve up is an effervescent bit of chiptune-flavored bubblegum pop that is uncomplicated, surprisingly traditional yet endlessly rewarding. K-pop has always been a visual-focused industry and it certainly helps that ‘Russian Roulette’ has one of the most memorable videos amongst those rated—pastel Tom and Jerry deadpan murder with killer choreo to match—but the song and its naggingly sugary hooks evokes the exact same joy even without the visuals. The concept is strong, and the execution is stronger, thanks to tightly stacked harmonies and meticulously enunciated syllables (check out the little variations in articulation in the first verse). By the time the hilariously indulgent chiptune synth solo comes in, it’s practically a victory lap since you’d been sold within the first minute anyway. - /u/raicicle 

> I’ll never forget the moment when /u/raicicle and I put in work to make the sub’s first K-pop rate amass over 160 participants, and I’ll also never forget the bloodbath that ensued thereafter. Seven of K-pop’s greatest groups of our time and Momoland competed for a chance at the podium just for Red Velvet to deservingly perform a podium sweep. I honestly could not have seen any song other than Russian Roulette winning - it’s delightfully saccharine juxtaposed in its video with clips of the members murdering each other in the most ridiculous and comical ways. It’s gorgeous K-pop that doesn’t overstate its quirkiness with harsh noises but instead expresses it with colorful vocals and adorable pieces of 8-bit music. I hope this being in a foreign language won’t hinder its performance in this rate too much because it truly is a phenomenal synth-pop song. - /u/selegend

---

My first exposure to Red Velvet came from the gritty, viciously girly ""Ice Cream Cake,"" which felt like *Lollipop Chainsaw* distilled into a three-minute song. It was fun and upbeat bubblegum pop poured into a murderous mold, and this concoction of intense innocence hooked me instantly. They tried this blend out multiple times, but it's with ""Russian Roulette"" that they got the perfect formula. It's all evident just seven seconds in, where that distorted, muffled cry operates as part orgasm, part asphyxiation, and you have to listen on to see which one it is. 

It's a perfect song. Not a perfect pop song, or a perfect kpop song. It's perfect because it accomplishes everything that it sets out to do, and then some. The arrhythmic heartbeat hook, the blank delivery coupled with coquettish gasps, the way the chorus winds itself around you — it's so infectious, like the best songs and the deadliest diseases. The video is perfect as well, featuring the girls killing each other in the most pastel YMCA ever in between shots of them dancing gleefully. Kpop is known as a generally light and fluffy style of music, but ""Russian Roulette"" takes this concept and lacerates you with it.

Red Velvet didn't ever really try out this kind of style again, which disappointed me until I realized that there wasn't any point — this was enough. My interest in the group has waned over the years, but even though their career may be reaching its final days (I can't see [""Black Mamba""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeerrnuLi5E) as anything other than Red Velvet's death knell), I'll always love this group and this song. Now, can someone make an edit without Irene?

**aestheticen** (11): The best Red Velvet title track, and the literal song embodiment of pastel colours

**anothertown** (11): I love everything about this song but the best part about it is that it seems to sound manic while not having a very high BPM

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (11): Damn, I wished Twice or Blackpink won the K-pop rate but Red Velvet is a well-deserved winner. Russian Roulette is definitely my first song from them and this still sounds fresh today. Since 2020 is the year I finally became a K-pop stan, I am giving this bop my 11.

**fadedblue09** (11): Originally this comment was supposed to be more positive and gushy about how I'm grateful to have discovered RV's discography and all that, but the recent issues made me think now isn’t the time for that. (P.S. EXID deserved better in that rate btw).

**hunnybee12** (11): Her face is wasted on her.

**imasalesman** (11): This is literally one of the greatest songs of all time

**intheaftermath** (11): I've only had Russian Roulette for 48 hours, but if anything were to happen to her... I never heard this song before this rate but I love everything about it. The minor steps on ""Russian Roulette!"", the small harmonies, oh my god"

> What most of the top songs in the One Hit Wonderland rate have in common is that they're arguably not by OHWs. Or at least the bands/artists involved had *some* form of success beyond the one song. The Cardigans had successful followups in ""My Favorite Game"" and ""Erase/Rewind"", Trevor Horn and Gregg Alexander racked up hits behind the scenes, Martha Wash of the fucking Weather Girls [was the voice of 90s house music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18N2k1TBBRE). Turns out, if you can make one great song, you can usually make another!

> And so it is with A-ha. While they only graced the Hot 100 twice after ""Take On Me"" (""The Sun Always Shines On TV"", which hit #20, and ""Cry Wolf""), they had a 25 year stretch of critical and commercial success in the UK and their home country of Norway. ""Hunting High and Low"", ""Crying in the Rain"", ""Summer Moved On"", ""Manhattan Skyline"", ""Analogue"", all brilliant tracks, as good as anything by Tears For Fears or Duran Duran. But ""Take On Me"" is easily the best work. The synth lead? Iconic. The climbing falsetto? Iconic. The semi-gibberish lyrics? *Iconic*. In other words, they weren't a generic synthpop act that got lucky with the greatest music video of all time. (though it sure helped).

> Last year the band released [an extensive four part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlTHJJX7QVU) documentary about Take On Me's music video, reuniting lead vocalist Morten Harket and the MV's lead actress Bunty Bailey, who he had dated for a few years afterwards. Earlier this year it became the 2nd music video of the 80s to hit a billion views on YouTube (after Sweet Child O' Mine - goddammit straight people). - /u/GlialUreterostenosis 

> One-hit wonder is a term normally thrown away as an insult, a way to point out how an artist just got lucky and was incapable of connecting with the mainstream conscious more than once... some artists rejects this label for this exact same reason and keep trying to reach for the skies once again, some of them embrace that source of income and popularity; and, at last, some would kindly point it out how they don't technically qualify for one-hit wonder status: Norwegian band A-ha have way more hits and a big following in their native Europe, but even in the U.S., when Take On Me managed to reach the top spot based mostly on the success of its now iconic music video, they also have another Top 20 hit.

> Take On Me is the quintessential 80s song full of danceable warm synths, relatively clean lyrics and a music video for the ages, featuring an edge-cutting mixture of hand-drawn animation and live-action settings; considering all of the previously mentioned, it's not a shock that it ended up winning it's respective rate against novelty songs, maligned inescapable hits and overall terrible tunes... but what it is a shock is that A-ha rarely gets the respect they deserve more than 30 years after their debut and they continue to get dumped in the same category as La Macarena, Gerardo's Rico Suave and Gary Glitter. - /u/radiofan15

---

I'm gonna be honest, I first learned about this song from some cable TV special in 2006 about ""viral"" Internet videos, and this was #1 and they played clips of it and I thought it was lame. The song does kinda bop in a way, even though [this is just how I feel when the chorus tapers off](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DuVFbWusb4Q/maxresdefault.jpg). Scandipop is always fun, though, so I can't help but enjoy this in the very very rare instance that I'm exposed to this song. Stream ""Feel This Moment"" by Legend X featuring Pitbull today!

> In what it has to be one of the most meme-able songs ever to win a rate (outside of the actual Meme rate) and, somehow, one of the most niche winners so far (a nu metal song with unintentional Christian undertones), Evanescence's magnum opus Bring Me To Life managed to defeat the relatively more popular (in sales, influence and general relevance) rock acts Green Day and Linkin Park, in a victory that faintly recalls that of Amy Lee and company at the 2004 Grammy Awards for Best New Artist against a very salty 50 Cent.

> The song, which gained popularity thanks to its inclusion in a cringy montage in the much-maligned 2003 superhero extra-blah-ganza Daredevil have become synonymous with AMVs, Windows Movie Maker, goth subculture and, somehow, Mike Shinoda... but that doesn't take away the fact that, as the saying goes, memes aside, this is a great song, and a deserving rate winner. - /u/radiofan15

---

This may be a massive meme, but it is also a legitimate classic on a level that very, VERY few songs in this rate and in this universe can be considered. Evanesence made their mark on Hot Topics in malls across America when they dropped this, and it's remained a cultural staple. Amy Lee's vocals are one-of-a-kind, like they've been sent to Earth just to be cast across those searing electric guitars.

This song works as a meme because it takes itself so seriously to the point of camp. It's intense and emotional and dramatic that you can't help but either buy into the dark fantasy it's peddling, or join in on the ride and laugh along the way. It's fun either way, prime for both ironic and unironic listens.

> Strangers is how most of the pop world was introduced to Sigrid. This was her breakthrough hit in the UK and won her the BBC Sound of 2018. A tight, cohesive synthpop bop, it's no wonder this song toom off with pop fans. It's also very relatable. Its lyrics about love, uncertainty, and lonelieness are more candid than a lot of pop songs, and that's part of what makes this song so relatable. - /u/static_int_husp

---

Sigrid's budding career was comprised of ""Don't Kill My Vibe"" and its many rehashes — rehashes that would last well into her debut album — but it was ""Strangers"" that really showed that she could take on a different style, even if that style was a bit rote. Yes, we've heard these churning, building synths before, and we've had many songs with this exact title and this exact subject matter, but Sigrid's take on it all remains joyous to listen to. It's a rollicking good time, prime for Scandinavian pop playlists on Spotify, and despite the song being about the loss of love, you can't deny how it makes you want to swing along with her.

And our first artist with multiple songs in this rate is OUT. I'm lowkey surprised this is the higher of her two songs, and I'm also surprised by how high this is in general. But this is a good surprise, as this is still one of my favorite songs from her. I love the plain delivery of the verses compared to the rollercoaster of emotions in the chorus, as you can literally hear her voice go high and low, ebbing and flowing with her shifting moods. Her portrayal of substance abuse and heartache and whatnot is pretty boilerplate, but there's still a cathartic energy being unleashed throughout the song that I still find enjoyable even after so many streams. Notably, this was Tove's big breakout single both worldwide and in the United States, and it's a wholly deserving one — as long as you ignore that Hippie Sabotage Remix thing."

> ""Your Best American Girl"" is such an enigmatic song. It has such a personal theme of the difference between someone from an immigrant family, and someone who isn’t. The line “Your mother wouldn’t approve of the way my mother raised me, but I do, I finally do” especially sticks out to me. Of course, I‘be never had to experience the same thing, but it really offers an interesting perspective of someone who has, and in a way non-immigrant people can understand. Plus, the production is great, especially the soaring guitar in the middle of the track. It definitely deserved to win its rate, for sure. - /u/survivorjdmarina 

 > I had the joy of helping host the Women Who Rock rate and let me just say: Mitski absolutely destroyed the competition. The winner was not even close after the first day of scores, it was essentially a race for second place. Your Best American Girl was a unanimous favourite and for good cause. It's a powerhouse of a song and the lyricism is so refreshing in the landscape of indie rock. Mitski uses her own personal experiences to create a passionate track, marked with some killer guitar lines and vocals. It's cathartic, sure, but it's 100% what the song called for. I'm hoping she can pull off similar results here, she really deserves it with this amazing track. - /u/TiltControls

---

In the Top 100 tracks of 2016 according to /r/popheads, our annual countdown of the user-voted best tracks of the year hosted by /u/raicicle (vote for the 2020 version now!), [a Mitski song got as far as the Honorable Mentions](https://medium.com/@itsrai/the-top-100-tracks-of-2016-according-to-r-popheads-intro-honorable-mentions-ba6c18ec96ed#.7twnaghkz), but not onto the actual list. I had voted for two Mitski songs: ""Happy,"" which was the first Mitski song I listened to and the first I fell in love with, and ""Your Best American Girl,"" a song that I had also voted for but at the time wasn't fully in love with. Of course the latter made it on, and I was happy enough that she at least had some representation somewhere, but I didn't think much about it at the time. I had enjoyed Mitski despite not really caring for indie rock — I believe I'm the first person to ever post her on the sub, when I posted the [\[FRESH VIDEO\] of ""A Burning Hill""](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/5719b5/fresh_video_mitski_a_burning_hill/) and received a whopping dozen or so upvotes — but it wasn't as though I really thought she would have much of an endearing impact on the sub.

Then *Be the Cowboy* came out (and ""Nobody"" which I still don't really get), and I bore witness to how Mitski was actually surprisingly loved by a lot of people on /r/popheads. When we eventually rated *Puberty 2*, I ended up listening to ""Your Best American Girl"" a lot more and, in turn, understanding it much deeper than I did in 2016. I think many critics also went through this rediscovery phase; it was more extolled in decade-end overviews than in those year-end ones. I've never been one to care about whether songs resonated with me personally, but ""Your Best American Girl"" was an exception. This is, at its core, a love song, one about a boy with whom she wishes she could have an equitable relationship. It's doomed, of course, not because of just differences, but because of this sense of inferiority — the line says that his mother won't approve, not that she won't understand. And therein lies the issue that I truly believe only people of color (and especially children of immigrants) will understand in the western world, that even in spite of whatever progress has been made, there will always be this sense of not being quite on the same level as the white boys that you find yourself chasing after. I love the video as well, as low budget as it is, which shows Mitski tonguefucking her own arm, literally learning to love her own skin. It's a painful, raw love song, and the fact that she transmits all of these complex emotions in an indie rock song — a genre defined by and overly populated with white boys — only adds to the message behind it. I adore this song so much, and I'm glad that it's made it this far.

> In hindsight, ""Hot N Cold"" can sort of be used as a microcosmic evaluation of Katy's career; white-hot in the early part, from her One of the Boys' release in 2008 to her Super Bowl Halftime Show performance in 2015, only to burn out so fast in 2017 as Katy shorn her black tresses and sex appeal, and frankly, I don't think that's fair. While I can't say I'm too impressed with Katy's recent behavior, I certainly hope her newfound motherhood helps steer her in the right direction as she continues to rediscover her personal joy. - /u/twat_brained 

> I remember waking up every morning for school and the music video for Hot N Cold would be playing on MTV. I was still closeted back then and I hated pop music, but Katy rly did smth with this whole album and made light pop rock music sexy and acceptable for my secret little gay heart to obsess over without anyone thinking it was weird. While not my favorite on the album (Fingerprints, whew), Hot N Cold is one of Katys most iconic songs, and totally a song that unlocks the nostalgia in absolutely anyone. - /u/shipsinker44

""I Kissed a Girl"" may have landed Katy Perry on the map, but it was ""Hot N Cold"" that proved that she wasn't just going to be a one hit wonder. In comparison to her first hit, this song turns down on the problematicness (but not entirely — the bipolar line hasn't aged the best) and turned up the electropop and the antonyms. I remember listening to this on my sister's iPod in 2009 and I literally felt myself turning gay, especially as I found myself listening to it again and again and again. And when I first saw the music video? Those zombie brides on bicycles are forever ingrained in my mind. It's just a master class in how catchy and powerful a pop song can be, and while I'm not too chuffed to see it this low, I'll forever associate this song with that era of pop music. Now go and stream *Smile* — Daisy Perry Bloom needs a new set of bibs.

> Yes I am lowkey king of the popheads Lambily, back with my second Mariah addition to this rate! Winner of the Mid 2000s rate, it's not really close to my favorite Mariah song when I think about it (sorry but Cool was robbed)... but then I hear Babyface. When I actually listen to this song I'm reminded that it really is just an excellently written ballad with a catchy melody- there's a reason this catapulted her from home back to superstar, while also winning Billboard Song of the Decade after 14 weeks at #1 you know! Not much more can be said about this song as it slowly approaches Rolling In The Deep numbers of times being rated, i won't blame you all of it places a little low because of it - /u/yatcho

---

Mariah's career had a shaky start in the 2000s (Wikipedia straight up says that her ""popularity had substantially declined and many had considered her career as over""), but everything changed in 2005 when she dropped this ballad. It's not the most intricate song; it's a slow burning ballad about a lost love that needs to return, and with an climactic ending where Mariah shows off her vocal pipes for a bit. Yet the song became a monstrous hit, planting itself at the top of the Hot 100 for *fourteen* weeks, even blocking herself at #2 for a bit. It wound up being the #1 song of not just that year, but of that entire decade. This song literally defined an entire decade of mainstream music in the states, and here it is at #20. Gotta love /r/popheads!

When I started getting into Mariah, this obviously was one of the first songs I was exposed to, and it quickly became one of my favorite, long after it had left the Hot 100. It's classic languorous Mariah, and you don't need much else than her crystal clear vocals set across a simple piano melody.

> The Weeknd continues to draw from MJ as his influence in this collaboration with Daft Punk. The closing track for the album Starboy, this was easily the highlight of the album (as a lot of people agreed with in this all men rate.  Personally it’s one of my favourite tracks from him in his entire discog (well top 10 for sure). It truly feels like it will be timeless, and it still sounds fresh 4 years after it came out. To conclude my write up, please stan the Weeknd, he’s doing it like no other pop boys in the past 5 years. - /u/ignitethephoenix 

 > I guess I wasn't suprised I Feel It Coming won. The weeknd is the most well liked of the three artists and I Feel It Coming is the most pop sounding song on the album. Yetti guessed on day one that this would win and while I thought a couple other songs had a chance at the end it definitely made sense. - /u/fishingfor8

---

As part of The Weeknd's steady transition into a poppier sound, *Starboy* was a surprisingly eclectic album, with this disco-inspired Daft Punk-assisted track coming out as its second single. (Cirkut, the producer/boyfriend of Ava Max, was also part of its production. When are we getting ""In Your Eyes (Maxcut Remix)""?) It became a hit, peaking at #4 on the Hot 100, and still remains memorable despite bigger hits preceding and following it. It's an irresistible slow jam, with his naturally seductive vocals soothing you about his incoming love/orgasm/death/whatever. This isn't a song that turns you on (but I wouldn't judge you if it did); it's a song that helps you wind down in the nighttime.

Anyone with ears can tell that this is primarily a disco pop song, yet it apparently won some BMI R&B/Hip Hop award. If anything, this is just evidence that the bullshit over what counts as pop and what isn't pop is so arbitrary and, more often than not, rather racist. This is an excellent pop song from an excellent pop star, and it's a shame that he's still fighting these demarcations so late into his career.

And the second ABBA also bites the dust! Did you see that one coming? I was lowkey shocked that these two songs were always skirting on the edges of the top 10, never decidedly getting very deep into day 3, and when the final results came out I knew that getting ABBA out right at the end of day 2 would be a fun little gag. 

I would've happily accepted a ""Dancing Queen"" win, though, especially if it managed to win again without a single 11. It's a testament to how beloved this song is that most people just tossed it a perfect score and didn't think much else. And can you blame them? It's such a groovy track with a downright iconic opening, inviting you to just glide along and really believe that you, too, can dance. I'm surprised that people can even find it in their hearts to dislike this song at all, to be quite honest!"

> A hip hop song, just like Starboy by The Weeknd. In hindsight, the 21st Century Hip Hop #1s rate was a bad idea with the Billboard Decade-End rate just around the corner. But hey, at least we gave this objective classic a rate win it would probably never get otherwise, and we kept Kanye from becoming the artist with the most wins in rate history. - /u/TragicKingdom1 

 > Hey Ya! was always bound to win the rate, for two reasons: it's an iconic piece of music and it was also the whitest track in the mix besides the Macklemore songs. It's the epitome of happy sad and the fact many people to this day are still clueless of its real meaning shows how genius and great this song is. Nothing more to say, just shake it like a polaroid picture. - /u/MashLuke

Did you know we weren't the first -heads subreddit to have a rate won by OutKast? That distinction instead goes to, of all subs, /r/indieheads, where this song took the crown of their rate of the top 50 songs of the 2000s, as chosen by Pitchfork. If you look at the [lowest scores for its winning post](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/6y1rrl/rate_reveal_the_pitchfork_rate_day_3_every_song/dmk8wrc/), you'll even see me there! Oopsies. 

This song has grown on me, and that's honestly mostly because I stopped trying to enjoy the music video of the song (and its annoying incessant screaming effect applied all over it) and just enjoyed the song as is. It's just a solid pop song (that won a rate for hip hop #1s, which feels a little weird, but I'll leave that to others to comment on), and the fact that it's notched a win on both /r/popheads and /r/indieheads is a testament to its universal appeal. When is OutKast getting their well-deserved halftime show, though?

> It's no surprise that Mariah Carey won the holiday rate with this quintessential classic. Becoming the first song to break the 0-10 scale in rates, it amassed a 10.038 average its first time being rated. One of the best selling songs of all time, it has broken numerous records such as longest trip to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and best selling Christmas single by a female artist. The festive song has spawned 3 music videos, a childrens book, an animated TV special, three Guinness World Records, and many [iconic performances](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKIY9tCaqU0). The song has become so much bigger than itself or Mariah Carey, it's gone on to represent the Christmas season, and will be heard for years to come. - /u/NapsAndNetflix

---

If we started this rate maybe a month afterwards, this probably would've made it to the top 10, and maybe even could've won. And honestly, I would've been more than happy to see this win. It's not only a stone cold classic — like, quite literally the song here that's going to be played the furthest into the future — but it's also an incredible song, full of camp and drama and sheer *joy* that everyone who hasn't worked in retail before can enjoy. The fact that it gets spammed to death every December, and the fact that so many people seem to feel so strongly about Christmas music, doomed it to this placement, but no matter what you think of this song, you already know that it's going to be everywhere shortly. Thanksgiving is over babes; it's Mariah season now.

> The winner of the Classic Greatest Hits Rate, this was a slightly unexpected winner, but very deserved. Going in, I knew ABBA would definitely win but I would have picked Mamma Mia or Dancing Queen as the winner instead. So this was a nice surprise and I definitely agree it’s one of their best songs. The riff is iconic and gave us another excellent song in Hung Up and one of Ava Max’s best songs, Torn. And the lyrics are a big mood that majority of the people in the sub can relate too! Anyway please stan or continue to stan ABBA guys, they truly do have some of the most memorable pop songs of all time. - /u/ignitethephoenix

> I had so much fun hosting this rate with u/ignitethephoenix. We laughed, we cried, we saw our faves get slaughtered until one song remained: Gimme x3. What can I say? The girls and the gays love it. It's an undeniable bop, but I was surprised that it won (I thought it was going to be Mamma Mia tbh) Thank you to everyone who made it such a success and thank you for stanning ABBA. They are truly incredible and more than deserving of the title of winner!! - /u/poppinmmolly

---

And the first ABBA song bites the dust. I thought ""Dancing Queen"" would've been decidedly more beloved than this one, but a surprising number of commenters said that they much preferred this ABBA track. It's definitely as campy and dramatic as their best hits, and I love a good ode to a midnight dicking, but it's a little tiring after a certain point, and the hook has been outdone by Madonna (and, if we're being completely honest here, Ava Max). Hell, I didn't even expect this to win its original rate, but as a 12 year old, I guess I can't really speak too much on these old legendary songs.

---
**ManofOranges** (11): An example of perfection in song form. Of all the songs here, I could see this one winning the rate honestly

**nootnoot781** (11): not only is this pop perfection, it also birthed hung up. legendary

**sandyfishnets** (11): this song is perfect - the harmonizations, the bassline, the cheesy violins, the synths, everything works so well together

**WillamThunderfuck** (11): Probably the best ABBA song in my opinion (which by definition also makes it one of the best songs ever in general)! It's so intense and high energy, which is right up my alley. Also the lyrics are very relatable lmao"

> Did the Redemption Rate have disastrous results? Yes. Would I have preferred nearly any other song winning the rate? Yes. Was the rate itself only conceived to keep Bad Romance out of this rate? Yes. Do I regret it? No. I think more rates should strive to capture the unexpectedly chaotic energy of the tonal shift from ""omg all the songs in this rate are so good :heart_eyes:"" to ""WHAT THE FUCK?? :rage:"" two songs in. Ending with a track that was beaten by 3 songs from its album in its first rate winning with a low 8.5 average is just the cherry on top. To quote my good friend /u/ImADudeDuh, MWAH! - /u/TragicKingdom1

---

I thought we were safe. As we approached 100 winners, and this rate was on the horizon, I was safe with the knowledge that Lorde and her guttural singing would not be present in this rate, aside from her wispy backing vocals in that Bleachers song I already forgot the name of. We had literally rated every single Lorde song in existence. *The Love Club EP*? Rated. Her *Mockingjay* bullshit? Rated. ""Magnets""? Rated — [twice](https://media1.tenor.com/images/86946840fa4c568abd589a71477c6859/tenor.gif?itemid=12137501)! And all she had a nice little win for ""Ribs,"" a nice, little, deserving song from a solid album that made it a little too far in the first winners rate, but at least it was a good song. I was happy. I was content. I was...safe.

But no. /u/TragicKingdom1 had other ideas, and in a last-minute attempt to ~~make sure we didn't have to include ""Bad Romance""~~ make sure we had 50 even songs, he threw together a calamitous monstrosity known as The Redemption Rate, where songs that weren't good enough to win their original rates, nor good enough to get onto, let alone win, All Stars, would compete. There were excellent, career-defining songs on there, from incredibly popular, innovative, talented artists, as well as ""Getaway Car"" and songs from Years & Years and Bleachers, but /r/popheads showed its true, disgusting colors when the final two came about. In second place was ""Your Type,"" a...*fine* single from a great album by a great artist, and in first was this shit. He's gone on to try to retcon that rate as a [""social experiment""](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/iobvfj/the_redemption_rate_reveal/g4dfrzo/) — I guess what we learned that day is that some experiments fail.

I know this is a Wendy's ma'am or whatever, but let me go off a bit. The problem wasn't just that a Lorde album track that came in at like 7th in its original rate beat out so many iconic, genre-defining and genre-defying classics that spanned decades and multiple genres. The problem was that I don't even think the song is good. I don't like the titular metaphor, which is beaten to death despite not being properly explored in the lyrics, and the production is Jack Antonoff at his most repetitive, with synthwork and beats that we've heard many times from him since then. I can't deny the charm of the line ""In my head we do everything right,"" but the way she repeats it just makes me realize that there's nothing else to latch onto in this song. I get the appeal, but it's just not for me. I'll happily stream many other *Melodrama* songs, or stream something else because I'd like to think that I'm a generally well-adjusted individual, but I will never buy into the love that this song gets. Whatever. At least it didn't make it any higher.

---
**slimboyfriend** (11): the centerpiece of Melodrama and the sequel to Ribs. Also the only song in this rate that can make me cry no matter how happy I am before listening to it

**starlitsuns** (11): This is probably going to go out day 1 since everyone is still upset over this winning the Redemption Rate but goodness I have so many words to say about this song. Obviously Green Light helped me out of a depression that lasted over a year in high school, but this song was the big hug I needed. Lorde realizing that she could manipulate the memories of her relationship so that she could finally move on without her ex is (in my opinion) the superpower she speaks of in Writer in the Dark, even if only Lorde believes she wasn’t in the wrong. It’s powerful, it’s what we all need to do sometimes. On top of that, Jack Antonoff’s production is godly here. Interpolating Green Light is only the tip of the iceberg, and the outro is the final tears of joy when you realize you’re out of the rut you were in. The scream at the end of the bridge has cleared my skin, given me good grades in school, and healed me in so many ways. I’m going to get off my soapbox now so that you all can read other comments, and so that I stop acting like a clown since I’m a Lorde - Supercut stan on r slash Popheads.

> When I signed up to host the Pitchfork Rate earlier this year, I instantly knew that Cellophane would either place high or win, and it was in the lead the entire time. However, I’m not even sure if it’ll make it to day 2 or 3 in this rate, which is a testament to how strong this rate is. It’s not at the level of an 11 for me personally, but I still think that Cellophane is a perfect track that delivers a crushing take on the brutal scrutiny of her prior relationship. The video that accompanies the song is just as wonderful and was rightfully acclaimed last year by many. Regardless of the song’s placement in this rate, it has proven itself to be a remarkably beautiful song that will stand the test of time and remain a fan favorite for years to come. - /u/bbfan132

---

""Cellophane"" is like an intricate ornament sitting high on the edge of a shelf, eventually tumbling down and shattering on the floor. It's beautiful, delicate, and doomed for destruction. Every single syllable, every plunk of the piano, every gasp and breath and whisper is perfectly placed and manicured, which makes it all the more visceral when it does start tumbling down.

Apparently written about (sigh) Robert Pattinson and their falling out, ""Cellophane"" discusses the pure, simple heartache that comes when your relationship ends, then adds the pain of this breakup becoming a public affair, like some tchotchke wrapped up in cellophane. It's a doubly painful song that feels viciously raw despite being carefully manicured — a testament to the detailed care undertaken by FKA twigs. It's wild to think that she sat on this song for so long just so she could learn how to pole dance for its video, but the wait was worth it; the music video adds to the experience, as we see her literally ascend before crashing down. It's the sound and visual of an expert artist perfecting their craft, and bearing witness to both feels like an exquisite pleasure — until you realize that enjoying the song only feeds into the public spectacle of her breakup.

**1998tweety** (11): Good LORDE this song is incredible, there really isn't anyone else doing it like her??? Like wow first of all the vocals are amazing, the LYRICS are sooo amazing and actually get so much better when you know the context behind them. The production is immaculate. What's not to like???

**aresthormars** (11): This deserves the 11. She served vocals, sincerity, and performance. Who pole dances on piano track except FKA twigs herself.

> Slide is the sort of track that was always bound for pophead dominance. A bold new sound at the start of a new era from an established icon, a vibey, dancey summer anthem, an incredible guest vocal performance from a queer icon. It really does personify everything that makes a great funk revival track, pulling hints from the initial 70s wave, G-Funk and EDM in equal measure for an undeniable bop. Now watch it tank in the winners circle cos of Migos. - /u/camerinian

> Slide is the type of song that changes your perception of an artist. Calvin Harris has had his fair share of bops before Funk Wav Bounces vol. 1 but Slide felt like another beast entirely. While his early work was fun enough, it did not necessarily have that much weight or ambition behind it. Frank Ocean is a wordy, cerebral, mellowed out critical darling. By this point he already released Blonde which was already garnering a reputation as one of the best albums of the decade, so him hoping on a disco track with an EDM producer seems like a bad move on paper. On top of that Migos were also added to the track which adds yet another ball that needed to be juggled and somehow, Calvin Harris does it with ease. The fact that this combination of artists work at all, let alone sound effortlessly as great as they do, takes talent from everyone across the board. On top of all that, Slide has only grown in popularity and critical acclaim as the years have gone by. Looking back at the 2017 year end, it feels puzzling that Slide was only number 71 as it has since become a staple of summer playlists and beach party soundtracks. A bop of the highest caliber which immediately transports you to a poolside no matter what time of the year you are listening to it. With a tight groove, a bouncy bass, and killer features, it isn’t uncommon to hear somebody call Slide one of the best hit songs of the entire 2010’s. - /u/steelstepladder

This song will forever remind me not of summer, but of the Popheads Jukebox. In its early weeks it struggled a bit to get a decent number of reviews, but [Week 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/5y8fvp/discussion_the_popheads_jukebox_week_4_this_is/) is when things really popped off. It was a DJ themed week, featuring this song as well as Zedd and Alessia Cara's ""Stay"" (one of his early forays into the joys of ticking clocks), The Chainsmokers and Coldplay's ""Something Just Like This."" and...Cashmere Cat and Camila Cabello's ""Love Incredible"" (you can guess which one got the lowest average — and no, it wasn't the one with the male vocals). So many people ran over each other in praising Calvin Harris's latest summer jam, probably because this was the first time in years that he'd done anything mildly interesting, and at the time I was mostly just bopping to ""Stay"" too much to really care ddd.

I don't know if this song will ever really click for me. I appreciate that it's slow and laidback, but when Migos (and especially Offset) come in and the song gets a proper shot of adrenaline, that's when I actually start jamming. Frank's part is just too anodyne and sleep-inducing for me to really enjoy (my hot take of this rate is that Khalid would've been way better), and I'm a little offended that the homophobes outdid the homos on this track."

What do we have here? Why, it's Paramore's best song! One thing I love about Paramore tracks is the little sonic details that they build into their songs. In ""Still Into You,"" those would be that tumbling noise preceding the second verse, and the introduction of those little hand claps after that cry of ""your mother!"". Not to mention the pure happiness on display here; songs about falling in love are everywhere, but songs about staying in love are much less so, probably because it's just harder to keep the flame alive than it is to start that initial spark. Knowing that Hayley and the man this is about are no longer together adds a bittersweet element to the song, but it remains a precious time capsule of a moment in a relationship when you still feel like you're in your honeymoon phase regardless of how much time has passed.

**1998tweety** (10): a soundtrack song had no business going off this hard, deserved to smash

**akanewasright** (10): Since I did the rate this came from, I completely fell in love with this song. Every line is so fun, and they’re all delivered with such personality. Doja (and Ashnikko) went so hard on this one.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): Is this her best song? Yes, until she releases the rock version of Say So officially.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): I remember listening to the song for the first time and I wasn't sure if I was listening to a song by Azealia Banks. Turns out it was Doja! This song is a nice mix of Azealia with the production and Nicki with the flow. Azealia and Nicki comparisons aside, I also want to talk about this song's role in the soundtrack of Birds of Prey. I like Diamonds by Megan Thee Stallion and Normani but I don't know why executives at Warner thought that should be the lead single for Birds of Prey when Boss Bitch fits the vibe of the film a lot more. Knowing Margot Robbie personally chose this song to be included in the soundtrack showed she has TASTE! And oh, this is a Dr. P*ke free song so I can stream this comfortably!

**fadedblue09** (10): A potential SOTY maybe???

**frogaranaman** (10): a huge fucking bop

**hikkaru** (10): one of the best songs of 2020 period

**kappyko** (10): its like she shot ME in the dick

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): thinking about the radio edit of it where they replaced the chorus with boss boss

**twat\_brained** (10): I gave the wrong Doja song my 11 but I'm impressed that we a) got a song released in 2020 to be rated in 2020, and b) we're doing it twice. Go us!

**sarcasticsobs** (9.5): oh wow i am *late* on hearing this but i LOVE it, jfc. the beat is right up my alley and the mood doja is giving hits right

**astrologicalangel** (9): why is this so short??

**bbfan132** (9): a banger even though it’s sooo short

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): :cherry:

**intheaftermath** (9): I mean it makes me feel like a boss. You can really hear Ashnikko's writing influence on this too!

**ManofOranges** (9): This song has grown on me a decent amount since first hearing it. I was underwhelmed that this song, of all songs, had won its rate but I've come to appreciate it a lot more. Also the ""made friends with the floor"" line always gets me

**quinnpsych** (9): Love it at the gym

**WeastofEden44** (9): Yes mommy 🥺

**bigbigbee** (8.5): Doja Cat is such a special performer – it all just sounds so easy and natural to her. This track is amazing.

**Stryxen** (8.5): still confused how Rules went out day 2 it was the best song in the rate by FAR… this is good tho

**WillamThunderfuck** (8.5): It's a really good song, just wish it was longer.

**CarlieScion** (8): i AM a bitch and a boss

**Ionlywanttheworld** (8): too short

**PuggleMaster** (8): How the hell this song beat Damn Daniel or most of the songs in the top 10 of it's rate is beyond me. I was fully planning on giving this a low score but even I must admit it's a bop.

**RandomHypnotica** (8): The fact that this won the rap girls rate is kinda embarassing honestly

**camerinian** (7.5): y'all ever heard Aerosol Can by Major Lazer? Anyway

**fxsparrow** (7.5): Any one who will give this song below 5 I will chew chew chew you and I won't choke

**pat-rickstar** (7.5): It slaps but is kind of repetitive and a bit too short

**cremeebrulee** (7): the comment about popheads rating a 212 knockoff before 212 itself took me out LMAO

**fishingfor8** (7): I actually really like this song but this is not great compared to the competition of this rate. Its too blatantly a movie soundtrack song

**Frelock\_** (7): Good club music

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Love the maniacal energy and all of the quotable lines but when you stack this up against everything else in the rate… eh.

**joshually** (7): not bad… not bad at all…

**jsonphile** (7): ahh so this is where “madefriendswiththefloor” came from in Ariana’s Motive: Murder Mansion

**nooodisaster** (7): Powered stan twitter fan cams for 3 months straight

**plvstvcbvrds** (7): doja has had a hard year. this song is derivative and deserved better than this soundtrack, tbh. it's a song that would give me a headache while i worked a closing shift at express in 2009 but in a good way. it's very still ringing in your ears as you walk to the mall parking lot past the still open theatre and the closed cookie shop, you know?

**raicicle** (7): this is an itzy song

**skargardin** (7): birds of prey deserved better

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): this would be an 11 if it was the tik tok version that just goes “I’m a bitch, I’m a bitch, I’m a bitch”

**TragicKingdom1** (7): kinda wild that we're rating a 2020 song for the second time already when most songs need to wait at least a year to get rated

**wavingwolves** (7): when she repeats the end of the second verse... whew!!!

**seanderlust** (6.8): ""i'm a bitch. i'm a boss. i'm a bitch"" - my socially anxious ass after successfully giving one (1) piece of constructive feedback to my coworker

**addupten** (6.7): tick talk really overplayed this

**bulforster** (6.6): (#20) I'm not really into most of Doja's stuff but this is undeniably a bop.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.6): this is fine but honestly it sounds better in fancams than listening to the whole thing

**cloudbustingmp3** (6.3): WHAT U GON DO WHEN I APPEAR? W-W-WHEN I PREMIERE? BITCH THE END OF YOUR LIVES ARE NEAR! THIS SHIT BEEN MINE, MINE!

# Damn Daniel Deserved

**bespectacIed** (6): After years of rac-- hesitance, popheads finally allowed a female rap rate wow (but ofc it's only a grab bag bc it seems like we don't have enough confidence for female rap albums). Fun rate but whew if a doja song had to win why wasn't it the best ones (cybersex or juicy)

**lIIustration** (6): This song feels unfinished to me

**steelstepladder** (6): Perfectly fine but I still think this was like the 17th best song of the rap girl rate.

**aresthormars** (5): It is alright but I heard better songs from Doja Cat

**TiltControls** (4): it's fun sometimes, but in a winner's rate you're going to need more than that

**ImADudeDuh** (3): https://twitter.com/NICKIMINAJ/status/1271564996690841601

**Roxieloxie** (1): My roommate last year was really into doja so i have a vague idea of how some of her songs sound. I've heard this before not knowing it was her and i really didnt enjoy it, and honestly i still dont

**selegend** (1): one of the most clearly undeserving rate winners

**shhhneak** (0): I’m tanking this song because everyone on Grindr has it on their profile and I’ll lose my mind if it beats some classics.

**starlitsuns** (0): I wasn’t a fan of this in the Up and Coming Rap Girls rate, and I still am not a fan now."

**aresthormars** (10): Classic Gaga. I will forever associate this song during the earliest years of my life when I am so confused of who I am!

**bbfan132** (10): that chorus is so euphoric, ugh

**bespectacIed** (10): nothing else to say, Gaga literally shifted pop with this.

**cocosairdep** (10): Such an iconic song and music video. Gaga’s best song after Bad Romance imo. God I wish I had more 11s, this just feels sacrilegious.

**Frelock\_** (10): Iconic Lady Gaga

**frogaranaman** (10): damn young me was HORNY singing this song

**hikkaru** (10): gaga winning would be really boring and she'll probably have the top 2 but idc this classic is a 10

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Definitely my favorite Gaga song from this era

**Ionlywanttheworld** (10): iconic

**jackisboredtoday** (10): god i miss this electroclash production in the mainstream so damn much… feel like pure shit just want her back

**kirby31200** (10): Ingrained into me and every other zoomer

**ManofOranges** (10): This is another song I don't see doing well. Rihanna's probably gonna get her revenge with this one. Still a great song though!

**pat-rickstar** (10): Fu-fu-fu fuck her face

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): and again, a contender for my 11. i bought this album for 9 dollars at a Navy Exchange a month or two after it came out, and I thought i would never hear the name lady gaga again, and then she blew the fuck up. point being, i was a lady gaga hipster and you can all suck it. this song is amazing, and it changed the landscape of pop music in a lot of ways. i thought i would never forgive it after that glee cover, but man, i heard this song when i was drunk and it was like i was possessed by lady gaga herself. amazing!

**PuggleMaster** (10): I'll never forget walking the hallways of my middle school with this song stuck in my head. Such good memories.

**ReallyCreative** (10): while I would rather several other songs win, it's going to be entertaining to see the 5-6 grifters in the comments leading up to the top 10/top 5 pretend this song is awful because they don't want to be like other girls

**runaway3212** (10): This song is way too good to be heard by our human ears

**skargardin** (10): snapped

**Tolk1en** (10): I have so many memories attached to this song. Especially I remember how the media treated Gaga, how they discovered this worldwide phenomenon, and we all began to realize that a star was born

**twat\_brained** (10): there's no excuse for this losing Song of the Year to Single Ladies please stop watching the Grammys

**1998tweety** (9): bop but lowkey one of her weaker hits ddd

**mysario** (9): :flushed:

**slimboyfriend** (9): queen of getting the word fuck on the radio

**waluigiest** (9): I wish I knew I was gay when this came out :(

**WeastofEden44** (9): I want to roleplay as the Centaur from Percy Jackson while some daddy Lotus Eaters lures me into their lair 😌

**WillamThunderfuck** (9): This song was EVERYWHERE when I was a child and I still remember being lowkey obsessed with Gaga because of it (and I still am ofc)

**TiltControls** (8.7): Still holds up to this day

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): this is better than bad romance btw

**nooodisaster** (8.5): The music video was the beginning of my queer awakening.

**starlitsuns** (8.5): Rick Riordan stans are going to come after me for mentioning this, but including Poker Face in the Lotus Casino scene in the horrible adaptation of the first film was a choice well made. (Also, stream the Disney+ series when it comes out on Disney+ since it has Rick Riordan’s blessing attached to it.)

**anothertown** (8): the rare synthpop song that actually comes to life when done as a piano version, the versatility, the duality. There is a charm to this that has endured and bridge great, but there isn’t as much to it as other songs from this era

**cloudbustingmp3** (8): paparazzi outsold

**InfernalSolstice** (8): the more aged gaga song here but still boppy

**kappyko** (8): the bridge made me into who i am today

**Stryxen** (8): lady gaga used to scared me when I was younger

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): how many times have we rated this 🥴

**vayyiqra** (8): I like this song but always felt it was one of the weaker singles from The Fame

**SmileAndTears** (7.8): It's overplayed as fuck. Otherwise it would've gotten a higher score

**seanderlust** (7.6): *michael scott voice* it's britney, bitch.

**jsonphile** (7.5): Just Dance is the superior song from The Fame

**engifear** (7.4): TIL the lyrics are not ""She's got that limbo body.""

**bulforster** (7.2): (#17) A hit right from that iconic intro synth line.

**CarlieScion** (7.1): u happy /u/leixander

**akanewasright** (7): ...this song brings back bad memories.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Throwback to me hearing this on the radio as a kid and thinking Lady Gaga was black. I have nostalgia for this song because I did really like it as a kid but everything about Gaga’s discography afterwards just makes it sound so cheap and thin. Like I can’t go back to this after *Born This Way* and *ARTPOP* showed us Gaga’s true potential.

**joshually** (7): only the chorus is great TBH

**plastichaxan** (7): this is a blasphemy rating to 11 year old me i’m sorry kid

# Is Not Purchasing Haus Labs (Now $8.99 on Amazon)

**RandomHypnotica** (6.6): Fucker Face

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): I only play MTG.

**InternetDude19** (6): Fuck her face.

**steelstepladder** (6): Oooooooo returning to this song it's... actually not as good as I remember. I respect it for it's influence over pop music in the last decade but Just Dance is so much better I have to be honest

**zadooi** (6): Probably the weakest single from that era tbh.

**bigbigbee** (5.5): I liked this song when it was released, but IDK, I just think it doesn’t hold up to time that well. (Just Dance holds up much better IMO.) It’s fine!

**hunnybee12** (5): I have a distinct memory of a kid at recess asking me how you wake up lady gaga and thinking it was the funniest thing ever

**ImADudeDuh** (5): this is very overrated.

**racloves** (5): how do you annoy Lady Gaga? Poke her face

**welcometoNY** (3.5): i've never gotten the hype. aggressively average song

**fadedblue09** (3): Lmao one of the Gaga songs that I can't stand! I always found this annoying and that bridge is especially atrocious. I certainly don't miss the times that this was being played everywhere.

**wavingwolves** (2): one of her worst singles and i say this as a fan

**CrimsonROSET** (1): You know those scenes in movies where someone is drugged out of their minds, and it flashes how shit the party is in-between black screens as shorthand to the person we're following blacking out? This is that in song form.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): I forgot how weird the music was lmao

**frogaranaman** (10): Tove Lo didn’t have to go so hard on this song, and like mainly in the horny way

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): The hook of this song just gets caught in my head at the most random times! There’s something special about this song to me, it always puts me in an altered state of mind somehow. It makes me feel… not quite *bestial* but it makes me feel unhinged, like I’m coming apart at the seams and my jaw is barely hanging on to the rest of me and all I can do is lumber my flesh vessel around to the music. Maybe I’m just a weirdo but it’s a unique sensation at least.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): my nipples are charged thanks Tove

**Ionlywanttheworld** (10): should've been massive

**lIIustration** (10): almost fu11y charged ready to blow but not quite there yet

**ManofOranges** (10): Pure fucking bop there's a reason why this song beat the second place song in its rate by a country mile, that being because it's great and iconic.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): was obsessed with this song and it’s still great!

**plastichaxan** (10): this is an achievement in lyricism and i'm not saying it ironically this song is so good

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): this song makes me want to put on a sequin covered jacket and a swishy mini skirt and grind with somebody else's boyfriend with a bottle of beer in my hand in a pair of chunky ankle boots and just thot and bop ok it's perfect cross faded music and i love that it kind of sounds like the clown song because it encourages clown behavior!

**PuggleMaster** (10): talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before, unafraid to reference or not reference, put it in a blender, shit on it, vomit on it, eat it, give birth to it.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): This song is the easiest 10 in the rate for me, it's just so incredibly iconic, catchy and a perfect mood.

**runaway3212** (10): I don't think I'll ever understand the Tove Lo hype but this song is great

**TiltControls** (9.7): one of the few songs actually getting a point boost on rerate. Took a while to grow on me, but when it did I couldn't stop listening

**camerinian** (9.5): I really do just admire Tove Lo’s commitment to being horny on main

**WillamThunderfuck** (9.5): that's hot

**zadooi** (9.5): Oh to be as unabashedly horny as Tove Lo and making it work.

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): A stellar song, but it should land below top 10.

**nooodisaster** (7.5): 'disco tits' aka 'how to kill your career in one horribly chosen lead single' aka 'the straights just couldn't handle this one'

**ReallyCreative** (6): love the production, but everything else is super overrated by this sub not gonna lie. the vocal delivery detracts from the rest of the song really really badly, it just doesn't work for me

**aresthormars** (5): It is an okay song!

**Frelock\_** (5): Just not my type. But still well executed.

**pat-rickstar** (5): It's grown on me a bit since the rate it won buuuut…. I still don’t really know what you guys see in this song I'm sorry

**jsonphile** (4): uhhhh I don’t get this song. But since this is the only song on here I ranked lower than a 5, the only one I actually dislike (and not even that much), I guess good job on all the other rates popheads

**wavingwolves** (4): this song came and went and i already don't remember what it sounds like

**intheaftermath** (3): I've never loved the delivery of this song. It sounds uncomfortable, or at least makes me feel that way?

**fadedblue09** (2.5): I don't like disco and I don't like tits, so I guess it's fair to say I don't like this as well? (No, seriously, it's boring?? How do people like this?)

**welcometoNY** (2): yeah this is pretty embarassing.

**bulforster** (1): (#49) I like this even less than when I first heard it in its rate, those stupid laugh noises make me feel like I'm being trolled.

**astrologicalangel** (10): the video just makes it better

**bespectacIed** (10): Awww i love the first kpop rate, it felt like a protest in a time (not that long ago lmao) when the sub was still xenophobic about the genre. The tastelessness of the results still makes me irk (loona and exid robbed!). But wow what an amazing winner, we love murderous pretty girls on a catchy electropop beat. Red Velvet deserved the sweep but i was so sure Bad Boy would win, smack cam!

**CarlieScion** (10): the best kpop song in this rate

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): can Irene bully me next pls

**cremeebrulee** (10): wtff this bops

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I’m forever obsessed with this song. The icy beats, the cutesy but detached vocals, the intriguing interplay of innocence with violence, this straddles the line between mainstream appeal and absolute weirdness so perfectly and it’s exactly what we need more of in pop music. It’s a shame that it’s looking like Red Velvet won’t be around for much longer to be the ones to bring it to us but you can pry their discography from my cold dead hands.

**hikkaru** (10): when this gets robbed bc popheads refuses to stan kpop despite this being electropop perfection

**ImADudeDuh** (10): omg we love kpop

**worlds-okayest666** (10): i know this is gonna go out early bc “ew k-pop” which makes me SO mad because this is a perfect pop song and i know y’all would eat it up if a white pop girlie put it out. the vocal chops alone, man! THE VOCAL CHOPS!!!

**bigbigbee** (9.5): The better of the two k-pop songs here, and I say that as someone with great nostalgia for 2nd gen k-pop.

**WillamThunderfuck** (8): This is cute oooh!

**bulforster** (7.6): (#15) I really didn't expect to rate a song I'd never heard before, in a language I don’t understand, higher than 70% of this stacked as fuck rate but it actually is just that good.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.6): A cute, funky little track. Harmless but not that impactful in the rate really

**addupten** (7.5): I haven't really explored kpop much but I really like this

**bbfan132** (7.5): cute song!! not my favorite but still

**nooodisaster** (7.5): Unintentionally or intentionally this seems really dark lyrically? But you know I'm bopping.

**SmileAndTears** (7.5): It's ok I guess

**steelstepladder** (7.5): The better of the two Kpop songs here but I'm still not crazy for it.

**Frelock\_** (7): Catchy tune!

**Ionlywanttheworld** (7): I'm not a big kpop listener but this was good!

**bbfan132** (10): fun track, will always enjoy it

**camerinian** (10): I wish all pop music had tempos, riffs and vocal lines this fucking punishing

**CarlieScion** (10): norwegian legends!!! this is exactly the type of song all pop boys should be striving to make

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): [lady gaga talented meme]

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Legendary.

**frogaranaman** (10): goat music video

**ignitethephoenix** (10): mega bop

**intheaftermath** (10): Literally every part of this song is perfection. The accent, the synth, even the music video. I love it all so much.

**jasannn** (10): I'm a little ashamed discovered this song from the scene from La La Land where Ryan Gosling is playing for a 80's band at a pool party. Anyways, this song's hyperness and joyfulness never fails to cheer me up.

**pat-rickstar** (10): It's a classic how could I not

**PuggleMaster** (10): This is such a instant recognizable classic that it's hard to give it anything but a 10.

**raicicle** (10): I mean, it’s a meme but it’s a GOOD meme and also Blinding Lights is just this song

**SmileAndTears** (10): I can't believe they ripped off Blinding Lights

**starlitsuns** (10): EIGHTIES PERFECTION. Also, the Weezer cover for their Teal album slaps.

**static\_int\_husp** (10): Blinding_Lights_slowed_n_reverbed.mp4

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): tik tok illustrators study this music video for racy homestuck transition tik toks

**twat\_brained** (10): finally an 80s synthpop tune that existed when Carly Rae Jepsen didn't. Yes, ""How Will I Know?"" is in this rate but does anyone really think it'll outrank this?

**Roxieloxie** (9.8): I mean its a bop what else can I say

**RandomHypnotica** (9.7): This is no surprise that this won the One Hit Wonder rate, it's just SUCH a good song, and an absolute BLAST to sing at Karaoke

**1998tweety** (9.5): massive bop, we love a meme song

**jsonphile** (9.5): if you haven’t tried to sing those high notes and miserably failed then you haven’t known true joy in life

**seanderlust** (9.3): *trinity the tuck voice*  I don't know what the fuck she's saying but girl i'm living

**bigbigbee** (9): Everyone talks about the synth riff, but I think the vocals on this track are underrated. His voice is really soothing, something about his enunciation is appealing, and the way the chorus shows off both his lower and upper registers is really nice.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): I swear, every straight guy that I meet who is obsessed with 80s male pop would say that Take on Me is their favorite song. And you know, THEY HAVE TASTE FOR ONCE. ~~Men are still trash tho~~

**fishingfor8** (9): I like his deep voice

**Frelock\_** (9): Classic. I have inherent bias for older songs.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): Obviously iconic and one of the best music videos of all time.

**Ionlywanttheworld** (9): I wish I had his vocal range

**mysario** (9): the song that inspired ""Blinding Lights"" and ""miiiiiiiiiiine diiiiiiiiiiiiiiamooooooooooonds""

**quinnpsych** (9): Iconic, that's all I have to say

**runaway3212** (9): When I was young my mom showed me this music video as a 'beautiful video', but I was used to Lady Gaga's videos so I thought it was pretty boring. Looking back I can say I was an idiot child

**sarcasticsobs** (9): forget the high notes, let’s talk about the BASS

**addupten** (8.4): umm can we say classic

**bulforster** (8.2): (#12) Those synth lines, that falsetto, the music video… all just unbelievably iconic.

**aresthormars** (8): It is a bop

**CrimsonROSET** (8): Iconic in the best way, honestly.

**nooodisaster** (8): A great meme song.... this won the meme rate, right?

**racloves** (8): my mums favourite song of all time

**shhhneak** (8): I’m willing to say this is the best song released in 1984.

**steelstepladder** (8): A bit too boringly perfect for me to really give it full marks. It's such a fact of life that I don't really seek it out anymore despite being a classic.

**vayyiqra** (8): Idk if the lyrics even have a meaning that can be deciphered by mortal man but it's a damn bop

**wavingwolves** (8): quite the perfect pop song

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.4): IN A DAY OR TWOOOOOOOO

**WeastofEden44** (7.4): Good for the meme

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (7): a defining moment in pop, that's for sure

**skargardin** (7): bop

# Lights Not Glowin'

**lIIustration** (6): I’ve always found this song to be kind of annoying

**Tolk1en** (6): iconic but boring ... :pensive:

**waluigiest** (6): I’ll admit it’s a bop but the oppressive whiteness of the Cult of Take On Me turns me off from feeling the joy I felt listening to this song about 10 years ago

**Stryxen** (5.5): I hate that this song is so annoying cos everyone else just seems to love it completely and I want that

**akanewasright** (5): I can’t wait to see what songs we rate higher than this, and for the stupid high and mighty responses that will stem from that.

**anothertown** (5): I think I remember this being big online with roflcopter, ragecomic types in the 2000s as part of an 80s kitsch revival (similar with Wake me up before you go-go, rick Astley, etc.) so I have cringe associations with this and will probably never see the art in it. Sorry.

**CreepyMannequin** (5): I never cared for this and probably never will, sorry

**fadedblue09** (5): Iconic falsetto, but that’s about it. Not worth listening in full tbh.

**fxsparrow** (5): only good thing is the iconic Melody at the start the rest is Meh!

**moooo566** (4): I don't enjoy this song sorry

**ReallyCreative** (4): one of the most overrated songs ever... it's so annoying and it's such a shame some fantastic synths were wasted on a song like this

**kappyko** (3): the version where its just the song describing the actions in the video thats a slay

**Ghost-Quartet** (0): Why does society continue to insist that this song is anything other than absolute dog sh*t? This is like, “Africa/Bohemian Rhapsody” levels of overrated. It’s the worst kind of song: it sounds annoying but old people love it so you’re gonna hear it everywhere and it’s catchy enough that it’ll haunt you even after it’s mercifully over. This is useful as an example of a Major 7th interval and nothing else.

**WillamThunderfuck** (0): Sorry but this song is so annoying, the tune has become aggrevating to me over the years and the vocals are not for me."

**ManofOranges** (10): Even though I kind of deep down that this song was going to win over all the songs from American Idiot, I was still kind of disappointed when it happened. Doesn't mean I don't think this song isn't deserving of its win though, it absolutely is. Such a dramatic song. It's so over-the-top and yet it never goes fully overboard. It brings me to life

**mysario** (10): stream We Are The Fallen

**plastichaxan** (10): the way i unironically love this and it brings me back to my childhood

**PuggleMaster** (10): The video for this song freaked me out so much as a kid. Honestly I still have similar nightmares of falling out of buildings now, and I wouldn't be surprised if it came from that. ANYWAYS enough about me... This is such a legendary song that shouldn't be regulated to some shitty meme, but eh what can you do. At least it'll be remembered for a long time.

**runaway3212** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UClHmAtuPCk

**seanderlust** (9.4): Hi my name is Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way and I have long ebony black hair (that's how I got my name) with purple streaks and red tips that reaches my mid-back and icy blue eyes like limpid tears and a lot of people tell me I look like Amy Lee (AN: if u don't know who she is get da hell out of here!). I'm not related to Gerard Way but I wish I was because he's a major fucking hottie. I'm a vampire but my teeth are straight and white. I have pale white skin. I'm also a witch, and I go to a magic school called Hogwarts in England where I'm in the seventh year (I'm seventeen). I'm a goth (in case you couldn't tell) and I wear mostly black. I love Hot Topic and I buy all my clothes from there. For example today I was wearing a black corset with matching lace around it and a black leather miniskirt, pink fishnets and black combat boots. I was wearing black lipstick, white foundation, black eyeliner and red eye shadow. I was walking outside Hogwarts. It was snowing and raining so there was no sun, which I was very happy about. A lot of preps stared at me. I put up my middle finger at them.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): This song is so damn dramatic. But that's why we love it. 💀

**frogaranaman** (9): iconic meme song

**joshually** (9): the drama of this song…. The dramaaaaaaaa

**jsonphile** (9): ridiculously over the top and dramatic in just the perfect way

**nooodisaster** (9): One of the few songs I loved in middle school I still 100% unironically AND ironically vouch for.

**plvstvcbvrds** (9): BITCH this song is amazing. the drama. the chorus. the yelling. the video. the amount of time i spent blasting this song to my mother's chagrin while staring out the window during family road trips.

**selegend** (9): it’s an excellent song

**suhonyu** (9): the blue print, truly

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.6): idc this song goes off

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**AtomicViolet** (8): I feel like I shouldn't like this as much as I do

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): Boulevard of Broken Dreams was robbed in the first rate I've participated in. My score remains unchanged.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I lost my mind because I was like “oh my god it’s the song from [that Bionicles commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaLX6pRtM8I)” and it turns out that’s a completely different song but this song is still good. This basically defined an entire genre, if not an entire subculture, and it’s an important artifact of the ‘00s. Also the shitpost better be the Goofy version.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): this song is linked with too many memes for me to fully take it seriously as a song

**racloves** (8): too iconic no explanation needed

**raicicle** (8): i literally only associate this song with goofy now

**sarcasticsobs** (8): goth rock or not, amy lee just has an unbelievably great voice. i am becoming immune to nostalgia so I cannot abide the dude rapping nor his “scream”. But 8 points for amy.

**steelstepladder** (8): WAKE ME UP

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): why was this song such an important part of my life in 2009

**vayyiqra** (8): Would go from great to amazing song if that one dude would shut up

**WillamThunderfuck** (8): If it was the iconic Kidz Bop version it would've gotten my 11 tbh

**fadedblue09** (7.5): I find this a bit too overblown, but Miss Amy Lee knows how to serve vocals for sure.

**astrologicalangel** (7): way better than I remembered

**camerinian** (7): this is one that the memes have thoroughly ruined for me soz

**cocosairdep** (7): I’ll admit nostalgia is helping this one. The song is kind of a mess.

**engifear** (7): It's good, but Evanescence has loads of better songs.

# @Mii Channel Theme Stans, Thoughts?

**jackisboredtoday** (6.8): my ex was OBSESSED with this song and to this day I can’t tell how much of it was ironic “goffic” jokes vs how much was genuine

**shhhneak** (6.6): Fun fact! I first heard this song on a Sims 2 music video and I cried my eyes out.

**InternetDude19** (6.5): It is certainly memorable.

**starlitsuns** (6.5): reminds me of two things: my emo phrase when I was 15-16 in which I am embarrassed over, and that one Vine where the kids try to wake up the plastic baby doll

**bulforster** (6.4): (#21) Deservedly iconic, other than the rap verse this is unironically amazing.

**addupten** (6): I never got the hype for this one, it's okay i guess

**aresthormars** (6): I am kinda lukewarm to rock music. It is alright.

**bbfan132** (6): amy lee is an excellent vocalist but this song is so tacky lmao, the male singer’s parts are kind of bad and the production is weak

**Roxieloxie** (6): American Idiot or In the End should be here and yall know it

**bespectacIed** (5): my immortal >

**kappyko** (5): its iconic that this gay shit made it on the same radio as aggro masc music but this kinda starts sounding weird near the end as in like the audio starts clipping?

**kirby31200** (5): I consider myself a pretty big Evanescence fan and this is certainly my least favorite song on Fallen and one of the lower entries of their whole catalogue. It's dated and cringy in a way most other Evanescence songs aren't. At least it's a funny meme

**lIIustration** (5): This hasn’t aged well imo, but it’s still a good song

**ktajlili** (4): this was one of like thirty songs on my iPod shuffle. I listened to it every day for six months and now I almost hate it. lol

**CrimsonROSET** (3.5): Sadly, sometimes being only iconic doesn't carry a song. But I'm happy for those who can appreciate it! Even if I don't!

**waluigiest** (9): one of my favorite albums (and songs) that I was introduced to by a rate <3

**bigbigbee** (8.8): For this rate, I watched all the music videos of the songs I hadn’t heard before to give them a fair shot against the songs that I was already very familiar with. This song was 100% the one that was most boosted by its video – Sigrid is SO charismatic in the MV that it made me connect with the song more. I’m charmed. Highly recommend people watch the video!

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): She sounds like a goat in the chorus

**lIIustration** (8): slow, but the lyrics are so entrancing

**ReallyCreative** (8): the superior Strangers of this rate, but the fact that this song beat Don't Feel Like Crying is kind of a crime against humanity but whatever

**skargardin** (8): Sigrid comeback when

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): wow the world was legit just built different in 2017 tbh

**twat\_brained** (8): killer chorus but that bridge just undoes the song for me. Hanne's Strangers

**steelstepladder** (7.5): Think it's a touch overrated but still solid in most respects.

**nooodisaster** (6): I feel like I was one of the lowest scores for this in the original rate and then it won... I truly lost that rate.

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): Maybe it’s just that my tastes have shifted but this kind of sweeping synthpop has kinda started to sound empty to me, it’s like all of the noise and cavernous production is trying to compensate for soul that just isn’t there. It’s something that’s always kept me from connecting with Sigrid’s music in general, her songs are technically flawless but there’s just something missing, I don’t really get a lot of heart. Don’t come at me stans!

**welcometoNY** (3): i really don't get the hype with this song, and i've definitely tried. it's aggressively forgettable, the melody is grating, and the lyrics are laughable. i've managed to get into some of her other work but this song is just not for me."

**aresthormars** (10): Love this so much! I love it when we were playing pool with my friends.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): If Dancing On My Own is overplayed during my episodes of loneliness, then I play this song. This is Tove Lo's signature song for a reason.

**frogaranaman** (10): my dad loves her

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I love disco tits but this is definitely her better song

**ImADudeDuh** (10): thinking about that tweet that said “she made the best song of the 2010’s and then dipped” and then they replied to their own tweet saying “ok ok, I get it, I’ll listen to Blue Lips and Lady Wood”

**ManofOranges** (10): Pure bop, and it's kind of iconic how this song technically both won and lost its rate.

**nootnoot781** (10): but the hippie sabotage remix is a 0

**fishingfor8** (8): still like this more than I should

**Frelock\_** (8): Powerful emotions behind it.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): It’s so weird to listen back to Tove’s early work because she’s trying to project the image that she’s some kind of vocal powerhouse (something a lot of artists do on their debuts) and I’m glad she found her more subdued sound later in her career. This is still a total banger though!

**pat-rickstar** (8): The superior Tove song in this rate and you can't convince me otherwise

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): honestly i dont remember i was probably fucked up ya i was crazy back then

**bigbigbee** (7.8): I can’t believe I like this song now. I couldn’t stand the chorus vocals on the radio circa 2015ish. It grew on me after relistening and knowing that a bunch of people on popheads like it…am I a sheeple? :thinking:

**RandomHypnotica** (7.4): I will never listen to this song without thinking of ""this bitch dropped the song of the decade then dipped"" tweet

**anothertown** (7): I thought this was Miley for the longest time when this came out, that would have been a serve.

**CarlieScion** (7): very generic tove

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): Tove Lo has way better songs on her debut, but everyone loves it and I don't really mind.

**plvstvcbvrds** (6): the remix elevates this song so much that i hadn't realized i'd never heard the original. it's not bad, but it's so basic.

**InternetDude19** (5): I never want to hear the word 'greasy' in a pop song every again.

**steelstepladder** (4): I just don't like Tove Lo. This is so nail on the head obvious in terms of addiction songs but even compared to songs like Under the Bridge, Not an Addict, or even Chandelier from the same year it falls way short.

**cloudbustingmp3** (1): hab1ts

**fadedblue09** (1): You know what, maybe her music isn't for me. I was actually itching to skip this because of how irritating her voice was.

**kappyko** (1): this awful ass song....

**welcometoNY** (1): bland and uninspired with a grating melody. you're not quirky for eating twinkies in the bathtub. shut up.

**bulforster** (0): (#50) Sorry Tove Lo stans, I flat hate her lyrics and this instrumental is also really boring."

**bbfan132** (10): years later and this song still does it for me every time, i love mitski

**bespectacIed** (10): One of my all-time favorite rates ever. The overwhelming mitski love, annie doing well, people turning against lana, iconique. Btw anyone who gives this masterpiece a sub-10 score hates all 4 billion of us asian people

**engifear** (10): If it weren't for Kate Bush, this would've gotten my 11.

**fadedblue09** (10): OMG my first 11 to have won in a rate, and I couldn't be more proud to give it to such an excellent song. The only reason it's not getting my 11 this time because I prefer giving an 11 to a song once.

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (10): if you listened to this song you're depressed

**hunnybee12** (10): when the chorus comes in i lose it

**ImADudeDuh** (10): i’d say a comment here but i am afraid of being screenshotted and posted on some r/TrueReddit (aka r/you’re free to be racist here) post

**Ionlywanttheworld** (10): mitski never fails to make me cry

**Mudkip1** (10): pop perfection

**raicicle** (10): queen

**ReallyCreative** (10): she will not win but could you imagine? popheads showing taste?

**Roxieloxie** (10): this is alot rockier than the Mitski songs I've heard from Be The Cowboy but I really love this. Its so short lyrically but somehow it really captures the feeling very well. As a girl of color I can def relate in a way

**runaway3212** (10): Amazing

**sarcasticsobs** (10): C A T H A R S I S. my 11 if not for kate bush existing

**seanderlust** (10): the build up on this song is so good, it always impresses me no matter how many times I hear it. this was one of three contenders for my 11.

**selegend** (10): this is one of the top 5 songs from the 2010s, no doubt

**skargardin** (10): snapped hard

**Stryxen** (10): the best song on the best album by the most talented indie artist I said it.

**team\_kockroach** (10): Nobody who?

**twat\_brained** (10): If I'm giving Bring Me To Life a 10 I may as well do likewise for the other low frequency-boosted guitar slammer

**useless-sheep** (9.5): sob

**aestheticen** (9): This song is Loud

**aresthormars** (9): Mitski's performance is so wistful but when that chorus kicks in opening the gates of emotions, she really poured her heart out.

**lIIustration** (9): GUITARS

**pat-rickstar** (9): Same with Marina I've never listened to Mitski before but this slaps

**waluigiest** (9): love that mitski is a rate winner <3 <3

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.5): I should really dig into Mitski's music cause I really liked this one!

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): As an Asian person I love that Mitski wrote this but I was raised by my white father so I can’t say that I especially relate. Still, this song was a seismic shift in the music world and I hope Mitski’s star just burns brighter and brighter.

**moonagenightmares** (8.4): the grungiest parts of the song are the best parts

**starlitsuns** (8): I love the rock production on this!

**suhonyu** (8): one of the few mitski songs I like

**CrimsonROSET** (7.3): The build-up in this song is spectacular.

**plvstvcbvrds** (7): again with the people who make netflix movie music. that should be a genre. songs we'd hear while a shot of a girl in overalls plays out, and her hair is messy but not too messy and she has freckles

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Did You Know: analysts predicted that when Mitski’s critically acclaimed “Puberty 2” was released, sales of Dr. Martens womens’ shoes increased by a whopping 850% in a single quarter!

**vayyiqra** (4): A hot take but I don't get the love for this song. I'm just not into indie rock.

**nooodisaster** (3): I've kept trying to get into this song... and just can't. I've studied the lyrics, watched the music video, listened again and again... It's not for me. Sorry y'all!

**1998tweety** (10): Easily one of the best rate winners ever. It was so delicious seeing all the meltdowns from Swifties cause Katy rightfully won the rate. Stay bitter <3

**aresthormars** (10): Classic Katy Perry. Very catchy and the guitars are amazing.

**cocosairdep** (10): One of the most catchy, fun and danceable songs of all time, and one of Katy’s best. I’m so sad I don’t have more 11s :(

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): God, I miss being a KatyCat. :(

**runaway3212** (10): This was the first track I knew by heart

**selegend** (10): dr luke peaked creatively this period

**suhonyu** (10): the collapseeee

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): you know she deserves a 10 after all she's been through

**TiltControls** (10): The song that turned me around on Katy. Although I Kissed a Girl grew on me later, I thought nothing of her til I heard this. With the followup of Waking Up in Vegas and the whole Teenage Dream era I did a full 180 on her.

**twat\_brained** (10): Stream Smile so Daisy Dove can eat tonight

**WillamThunderfuck** (10): This was my by far my favourite song when I was like 8 and I couldn't speak English yet lmao

**worlds-okayest666** (10): yes this aged like milk yes i still love it no i will not apologize

**addupten** (9.5): a freaking HIT

**Ionlywanttheworld** (9.5): KPs best single off this album

**SmileAndTears** (9.5): Lemme pretend I didn't hear that bridge :)

**mysario** (9.4): it sounds so dated but that's in the charm

**ReallyCreative** (9.2): invented IcyHot

**bbfan132** (9): brings me back to 2009 when i saw her live at six flags great adventure

**Frelock\_** (9): A good romp. Classy and fun.

**jasannn** (9): As a kid, I remember thinking it was so scandalous that she used the word ""bitch"" in this song but the song still defined my childhood.

**ManofOranges** (9): Yeah this song is just very good to me

**raicicle** (9): the only reason I’m giving this a 9 and not a 10 is because katy actually is so good that this doesn’t even register as one of her best songs for me

**Tolk1en** (9): her best song by far, eternal bop

**slimboyfriend** (8.6): only girls change their clothes!

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): *One of the Boys* is probably the Katy album I listen to the most but I low-key skip this one most of the time, it feels painfully dated. Although it was ahead of its time on the whole ‘80s revival thing its take on the sound was kinda rudimentary and the language/casual misogyny didn’t age well at all, but it’s still kinda a banger.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): Waking Up in Vegas should have won instead of this

**starlitsuns** (8.5): Not a lot to say about this one. This is classic Katy Perry, so I have no choice but to bop.

**akanewasright** (8): Slaps

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): I forgot how awful she sounds on the verses here. The song is near perfect otherwise.

**kirby31200** (8): One of the Boys era Katy is my favorite Katy. If Waking Up in Vegas were here instead, it would've been an 11 contender

**nooodisaster** (8): It's fun.

**plvstvcbvrds** (8): bitch this song is amazing. is it a bit pick me - internalized sexism- yes, especially in the beginning, but then. then that chorus hits, her voice gets deeper and raspier and it's just infectious and poppy and one of the few songs that i can still listen to off this album.

**sarcasticsobs** (8): fun!

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): so many kids learned opposites from this song that katy perry has more worth than most elementary school teachers

**waluigiest** (8): this really prepped her for the teenage dream era what a great moment in pop history

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.4): me when i’m trying to defrost chicken in the microwave

**RandomHypnotica** (7.3): This song is forever tied with Masterchef Australia for me

**WeastofEden44** (7.3): Just say you have daddy issues

**CarlieScion** (7): love story deserved

**cloudbustingmp3** (7): i used to love this but its just okay now

**CrimsonROSET** (7): One of the Boys was her problematic era, huh? Like, she’d for sure get cancelled for some of this shit today.

**engifear** (7): It's a jam, but holy shit these lyrics have aged poorly. Honestly they were probably aged when they came out, but I didn't notice bc I was 10 years old.

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (7): ngl this sounds so dated to me now

**InternetDude19** (7): This sound hasn't aged well.

**seanderlust** (7): late 2000s vibes

**steelstepladder** (7): Katy has better songs but this is still great.

**vayyiqra** (7): Kind of catchy but she has better songs

**shhhneak** (6.9): YOU PEE A MESS LIKE A BITCH I WOULD KNOW.

# Cold. im very clever with these as you can see. jk someone please kill me i dont know what im doing

**anothertown** (6): Katy was so obsessed with the intricacies of whether or not men conformed to gender norms

**camerinian** (6): I have not had any desire to listen to this song past 2010

**intheaftermath** (6): oh my god i did not realize how horrible the non-radio edit lyrics were. You PMS like a bitch??? what???

**Roxieloxie** (6): its no part of me/wide awake

**Stryxen** (5.2): cold > hot

**bigbigbee** (5): I’ve never gotten this song, and I LOVE a lot of stuff on One Of The Boys. (Stream Fingerprints and Waking Up in Vegas, lol) I honestly think it’s pretty melodically AND lyrically boring.

**nootnoot781** (5): this won a rate? which one was that the most mediocre songs of the late 2000s?

**skargardin** (5): as a winner among winners this is not the strongest song

**wavingwolves** (5): this song reminds me of an ex girlfriend i had who said this made her think of me and a few months later i got diagnosed with bipolar disorder

**fadedblue09** (4): Look, I love Katy and I love One of the Boys, but I never considered this as one of my favorites. It sounds so plastic compared to the rest of the album’s rawness, and also when are we gonna discuss that its lyrics are kinda YIKES (that PMS lyric, “like a girl changes clothes…”, etc.)?

**hunnybee12** (4): you pee a mess like a bitch i would know

**bespectacIed** (3): pop perfection but at what cost

**ImADudeDuh** (3): i stay certain that this song’s production has aged like milk.

**bulforster** (2.8): (#39) I used to really like this song but the verses are pretty weak and the chorus isn't a strong as I remember.

**welcometoNY** (1): pretty typical bland pop song, but loses marks for the inexcusable ""you PMS like a bitch"" line."

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): kidz bop skinnier

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): I really hated that I used to underestimate Mariah's songwriting before. After listening to her deep cuts from Butterfly, Mariah is not just a vocalist but a fucking songwriter. We Belong Together showcases her strongest songwriting to date, singles wise. It's an iconic classic to this date for a reason.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Enough said.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): probably my favourite from her, a classic

**ImADudeDuh** (10): the mariah song i would be happy with winning the rate

**J\_Toe** (10): Love how Mariah has 3 songs here - the power she has

**joshually** (10): a perfect 10 of a song, like, there is no question. This is THE comeback to define all comebacks. Written off in the worst way, Mariah came back, and MADE THIS HEARTBREAKING BALLAD *THE SONG OF THE SUMMER*… like what? It’s also like the biggest song of 2010 the decade???

**pat-rickstar** (10): That video of the woman singing this while a stretcher gets loaded into an ambulance is so funny to me

**plastichaxan** (10): the contrast of how much i don’t like aiwfciy vs how much i love this is unreal

**PuggleMaster** (10): I mean who hasn't sang this song at the top of their lungs? Voice cracking and all?

**runaway3212** (10): Iconic comeback single

**sandyfishnets** (10): GOOSEBUMPS

**skargardin** (10): iconic

**twat\_brained** (10): After I practically bullied my dad into buying ""Emancipation"" I don't think I'd heard this song since like 2007 lmao

**TiltControls** (9.7): Mariah showing that she's got staying power with this song. One of her more emotional non-ballad songs that dominated airwaves for good reason

**WillamThunderfuck** (9.5): I feel like dramatically throwing stuff on the floor while wearing a robe when listening to this

**aresthormars** (9): This is classic Mariah. I just noticed how sparse the production is and yet it is so beautiful!

**fadedblue09** (9): I love Mariah, don’t think this necessarily deserved to win (not when Cool by Ms. Stefani was right there) and I don’t think Emancipation is that good of an album in general, but I can't deny its power.

**Ionlywanttheworld** (9): it's good

**jasannn** (9): All I can think about when I listen to this song is how KidzBop version did that that one girl dirty at the end.

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): the best mariah song in the rate

**ReallyCreative** (9): I have never experienced this emotion but I will be damned if I do not respect it!

**steelstepladder** (9): I like other songs of hers better but still great.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): not me sending this to my ex and getting a reply that just says “nah”

**waluigiest** (9): thinking about the cursed ending of the kids bop version lol

**worlds-okayest666** (9): “wait a minute this is too deep too deep” makes me lose it and idk why

**Stryxen** (8.7): just remembered we belong together by vampire weekend exists and lowkey sounds exactly like this lol

**RandomHypnotica** (8.6): Kidz Bop version outsold

**seanderlust** (8.3): oh man, it was a good time when VH1 was playing this MV along with sugar, we're going down by FOB and hollaback girl by gwen stefani. sad gays in high school stayed winning in 2005. also god wentworth miller was/is hot.

**WeastofEden44** (8.3): ICONIC

**camerinian** (8): hyperpop has ruined me, I listened to this once on YouTube at 2x speed and I just physically never want to listen to the original anymore. I’m not balladphobic, I have low tempo friends

**CarlieScion** (8): this only had to get rated like 3 times to win

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): This is good but honestly it falls somewhere in the middle of the tiers of Mariah’s hits, she has many more songs that are better than this. Still, all Lambs owe this song special reverence for being the thing that more or less saved Mariah’s career/reputation so instead I’ll just say WE BELONG TOGETHERRRRRRRRRR~~~~~~~~~

**ManofOranges** (8): This song is just alright for me, but when it gets to the end and Mariah just starts belting like crazy it does hit a sweet spot for me.

**vayyiqra** (8): Mariah queen of chill lo-fi hiphop beats

**wavingwolves** (8): lush

**CrimsonROSET** (7.5): We love a piano.

**WillamThunderfuck** (8.5): This is such a good chill yet groovy summer song

**CrimsonROSET** (8.3): The fact this is the only song by Daft Punk in this rate is sad.

**aresthormars** (8): Very groovy and catchy! There is something between Daft Punk's fingers honestly.

**fadedblue09** (8): Two things I'm happy about this winning: (1) We proved this is better than Starboy and (2) Craplie Puth didn't win.

**Frelock\_** (8): I like it. It's simple but fairly enjoyable.

**intheaftermath** (3): I'm sorry, The Weeknd is very hit or miss for me and this just isn't my taste

**KimberParoo** (1): This song makes death seem too sweet an end

**welcometoNY** (0): the Weeknd's particular schtick of off-brand Michael Jackson is more present than ever in this song, which makes it both impressive and frustrating that it's still so terrible. the weeknd is so incredibly grating in everything he does, so while there are a few moments that could have been nice in the hands of a better artist, his voice just makes this whole thing nauseating to listen to."

**anothertown** (10): This song is the strongest argument our civilization has for opening with the chorus

**bbfan132** (10): i’ve heard this way too many times but i still love it

**chillbumps5** (10): one of the greatest songs of all time

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): God, I have such a special memory of this song. My mother would often play this song as an attempt to make me stop crying. Like my feelings went 😭 to 😊 in a millisecond. I would say that this song is my early exposure to pop music in some form, along with Spice Girls.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): YOUNG AND SWEET, ONLY SEVENTEEN

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): https://positivewlwvibes.tumblr.com/post/181095452809/can-you-imagine-how-fuckong-nuts-straight-people

**ignitethephoenix** (10): absolute classic, deserved to be the only winner with no 11’s because it’s that universally loved

**ImADudeDuh** (10): We want this to win with no 11s again.

**jasannn** (10): A karaoke classic.

**lIIustration** (10): I am not the dancing queen ): but this still slaps

**ManofOranges** (10): I just know this song is gonna get tanked because probably have a vendetta against it for winning All Stars (I can't say I blame them) but I would just like to point out that this song won for a reason, that reason being that it's great

**MelodramaticLemonade** (10): Listening to ABBA for the first time for this rate but god this is such a perfect and instantly infectious pop song, if I have a second 11 it will go to this

**Mudkip1** (10): pop perfection

**nooodisaster** (10): DANCING QUEEN!! YOUNG AND SWEET!! ONLY SEVENTEEN!!!

**PuggleMaster** (10): This is such a great song that i'm sure will be in the top 10 and it totally deserves it.

**runaway3212** (10): This song is really fucking great

**sarcasticsobs** (10): disco is fun, detractors are cowards

**skargardin** (10): go off

**SmileAndTears** (10): Iconic, simply iconic luv

**starlitsuns** (10): I have nothing but good memories of this song. That is all I have to say.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): this is the song that’s gonna play on my end of movie freeze frame montage when I finally get arrested for smuggling kilos of cocaine through a suppository

**TiltControls** (10): Hoping ABBA can pull off a Dancing Queen part 2

**twat\_brained** (10): skinny legends. stan for clear skin

**welcometoNY** (10): a pop classic for a reason!

**WillamThunderfuck** (10): It would be a crime for me not to rate this a 10

**worlds-okayest666** (10): i love this but also if it wins again im gonna have an ulcer

**pat-rickstar** (9.8): Don’t love this quite as much as Gimme (x3) so that’s why it's not a 10

**intheaftermath** (9.5): the piano is by far the best part of this song. It adds so much to the chorus even though it's so small. So thank you, whoever played the piano here

**1998tweety** (9): Massive gay bop

**steelstepladder** (9): Probably ABBA's best song but Mamma Mia (the movie) is genuinely terrible and I've always had a bad knee jerk reaction to ABBA since don't @ me

**suhonyu** (9): i mean children were singing this song at weddings,graduations, funerals

**vayyiqra** (9): I did not like this song much as a kid and now I see how foolish I was

**bulforster** (8.8): (#9) I feel like this is going to get some undeserved backlash for how it won...

**WeastofEden44** (8.8): Imma be honest, there are better ABBA songs

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.7): okay after having an umpteenth abba phase earlier this year i've come to realize this isnt even in their top 5

**shhhneak** (8.7): I don’t think we appreciate how hard this chorus goes enough.

**addupten** (8.5): I wish the glee cover did justice to this bop

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Lol I remember how everyone was upset when this won. I didn't give it a 10 back then , so I don't feel accountable for any of that.

**succulentils** (8.5): LOL @ the random A5 ""YEAHHHH"" in the background right before the 3 minute mark

**aresthormars** (8): You can never go wrong with D I S C O.

**Frelock\_** (8): Good, but don't think it's aged as well

**Ionlywanttheworld** (8): Mamma Mia is the superior ABBA song

**plvstvcbvrds** (8): this song is a fucking bop. it's groovy, it's a skating rink classic, and it feels like that time that boy tried to kiss me at a church lock in and i ducked away from him because even then the touch of a man repelled me but in a good way

**quinnpsych** (8): Ruined a little bit for me by being so overplayed at every single party I'm at, but still slaps

**waluigiest** (8): we love a truly congenial winner. This song makes me want to learn how to roller skate

**wavingwolves** (8): sparkly synths yas

**Stryxen** (7.8): ah that’s history

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.1): god i wish that were me

**CarlieScion** (7): i resent this song for reminding me that im no longer young and sweet, only seventeen

**CrimsonROSET** (7): Listening to it in the car, I scored it a 10. Listening to it at 2AM in bed, I scored it a 4. I'll just split the difference.

**ReallyCreative** (7): yeah I'm still upset it won the all stars rate, it's fine but it's outclassed

**seanderlust** (7): seventeen is too young for a monarch, I will not stand for this.

**Tolk1en** (7): quite good but it is far from their best

# No Longer Seventeen

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (6): don't come for me, I think they have better songs

**RandomHypnotica** (5.8): Look, this song is catchy, but it's also kinda lackluster compared to everything else in this rate

**joshually** (5): this would be a perfect 10 except I dock points for the question “young and sweet only 17” datedly creeper part

**selegend** (5): kinda overrated

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): overrated

**akanewasright** (4): I love ABBA with all my gay heart. I’m pretty sure I was shot out of the womb singing Gimme x3. My parents used to play “Thank You For The Music” on long car rides to keep me from crying. But I do not like this song.

**hikkaru** (3): i hate it here

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (3): this song smells like old people

**Roxieloxie** (1.2): I do not get the appeal of this song, is it nice? I guess but I dont know if it really holds up against everything else in the rate. The only thing thats fun is the chorus. it redeems itself a little bit because my little brother likes this song and hearing it reminds me of him

**mysario** (0): it's still not the S Club 7 version"

**aresthormars** (10): I love this song when I saw a video of dissecting this song. The composition is so good at hiding the dark lyrics.

**bbfan132** (10): i need to listen to this album at some point

**bespectacIed** (10): remember when the least hip-hop hip-hop song won the hip-hop rate lol. Gave this an 11 so i share the blame

**CrimsonROSET** (10): This is really good! How did it win one of our only rap rates!

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): This song was played a lot when I was a kid, but I never knew the title until I was 17. You should see how shocked I was when Andre 3000 from Class of 3000 is actually a real person and made this ""unnamed"" bop from my childhood.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): The jingle in the background during the ""hey ya"" is the most recognizable thing in this rate tbh.

**fadedblue09** (10): Timeless bop. Here's to hoping it pulls an upset.

**frogaranaman** (10): me when I find an AskReddit thread that asks about sad songs that sound happy: Hey Ya

**ignitethephoenix** (10): classic, don’t rob this song because it has men in it! It’s easily a top 10 song here

**ImADudeDuh** (10): it good

**intheaftermath** (10): I swear this song is made of pure serotonin. I can't listen to it without smiling. Which is funny, considering it's about being miserable in a relationship

**ManofOranges** (10): Purely an iconic song. I hope this one gets far.

**mysario** (10): RIP polaroids

**nooodisaster** (10): Um....... perfection? Hooks on hooks on hooks, lyrical depth, pussy-pop-ability. Bow down.

**pat-rickstar** (10): Classic

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): it's just such a good song that it doesn't make any logical sense. it sounds like it came out 20 years ago but also yesterday. what a jam.

**ReallyCreative** (10): Gen Z will never understand how hard this song hit in elementary school when it came on the radio while riding the bus home... we could not be contained

**Roxieloxie** (10): Due to my area code im legally required to give this a 10 or higher

**runaway3212** (10): This is an amazing song

**seanderlust** (10): all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all

**bigbigbee** (9.5): I often cite this as the perfect pop song. It’s iconic.

**SmileAndTears** (9.5): Bop

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.1): lucy liu

**camerinian** (9): I've heard this song millions of times and I've only just recently started paying attention ""nah, y'all don't wanna hear me, you just wanna dance"" line, am I the problem

**CarlieScion** (9): the ultimate family get together song

**Frelock\_** (9): Fun and iconic.

**kappyko** (9): I hate reddit /r/ music nerds for ruining this BOP!!!!

**plastichaxan** (9): pure serotonin yup

**slimboyfriend** (9): Taking off a point because it would be really boring if this song won

**TiltControls** (9): Great, but if I see it in another AskReddit ""wHaT SoNg LyRiCs MeAnInG pEoPle dON't rEaLiZe"" i'm dropping this to a 0

**waluigiest** (9): a great song ironically and unironically

**jackisboredtoday** (8.1): I rarely listen to this anymore tbh but I can’t let myself forget when I was 6 years old and this was one of my favorite songs in the world

**1998tweety** (8): she's cute

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (8): SHAKE IT LIKE A POLAROID PICTURE

**PuggleMaster** (8): Girl they play this song more than some of the current songs on pop radio.

**Stryxen** (8): I love this song and I know all the words but it gets on the nerves sometimes yknow nothing personal

**WeastofEden44** (7.7): Tbh, I don't have any real memories associated with this song other than it just ran on a loop in the background of my childhood

**twat\_brained** (7.4): I don't think I can ever really hate this song but I'm definitely over it.

**InternetDude19** (7.2): Overplayed

# popheads

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): Objectively this song is good but also it gives me an anxiety attack.

**RandomHypnotica** (6.2): For an undetermined reason, I consistently get this song mixed up with Mambo No. 5, and as a result I get dissapointed every time I hear this song.

**anothertown** (6): this has aged

**hikkaru** (6): popheads: starboy isn't hiphop wtf!!! also popheads: hey ya best hiphop #1 of the 21st century yup yup

**joshually** (4): it was great when it was great… now it’s just kind… there

**lIIustration** (4): this is controversial but this song isn’t great, lasts too long and the “hey ladies” is very awkward

**bulforster** (3.8): (#34) I feel like this is supposed to be fun but it just isn’t for me.

**welcometoNY** (3): i didn't realize people actually liked this song to be honest. it's fine for a bit but it gets annoying quickly and overall there's just nothing great or even good about it.

**zadooi** (3): Perhaps my most unpopular opinion. This song does less than nothing for me.

**PointlessBibliophage** (2): no

**wanderingimpromptu3** (1): It's very catchy but it stresses me out

**1998tweety** (10): queen of xmas we stan

**akanewasright** (10): This is like... basically a perfect song. I’ll be a little weirded out if this wins, but it’s a masterpiece. I can’t give it a lower score.

**anothertown** (10): It makes me CRY that Mariah wrote this as pure escapism to try to heal her hellish childhood and it ended up doing as stupendously well as it did

**aresthormars** (10): This is the national anthem of North Pole and the main theme for Christmas.

**bbfan132** (10): tbt when we used to play the 2014 live version in the plug every day

**bespectacIed** (10): i immediately skipped when it played lol. Not for another 2 months please

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this is actually on my running playlist year-round

**CrimsonROSET** (10): We're just close enough to December where this is fine, but you're on thin ice.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): This better be #1 again this year if 2020 is going to have its redemption arc!

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): I unironically love everything about this and we don't even celebrate Christmas in Russia.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): the greatest Christmas song of all time

**InfernalSolstice** (10): serotonin in its purest form

**J\_Toe** (10): It's honestly weird listening to this outside of Christmas, but a 10's a 10.

**jsonphile** (10): Quite easily one of the best Christmas songs ever made, and nothing since has gotten close to topping it. Although I do sympathize with retail workers who have to hear this song and like five other holiday songs on repeat for two and a half months

**kirby31200** (10): A cultural staple

**lIIustration** (10): I’m Jewish and love this song

**ManofOranges** (10): I'm sorry but this really is probably one of the most iconic Christmas songs and for good reason. It absolutely puts you in the Christmas spirit faster than you can say ""I don't want a lot for Christmas."" It's pure holiday joy, and while I do get why people can get sick of it, it hasn't gotten on my nerves yet, and I hope it never will.

**nootnoot781** (10): i have many arguments against capitalism however one of my arguments for it is hearing this song everywhere from november to christmas. karl marx 0 - mariah 1 ?

**pat-rickstar** (10): Almost time to start listening to this again (and no, Christmas music is not acceptable in November. Wait until December pls)

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): bitch. BITCH. nothing says christmas like this song. also i listen to it at least once a week. but this song. even after working in retail during a single holiday season didn't ruin it for me, okay. this song goes slap the fuck off. it's all the best parts of christmas in one song. it's mulled wine and ugly sweaters and gifts and lights and driving around the neighborhood to see the houses and UGH why can't it be christmas already

**PuggleMaster** (10): This is a classic, but I had to skip this shit. Girl it is too early to be listening to Christmas music.

**runaway3212** (10): this is the only valid Christmas song

**sandyfishnets** (10): what about the My Chemical Romance cover tho?

**selegend** (10): i hate this song because it’s annoying but it’s a good pop song

**welcometoNY** (10): there will never be another song like this, and there doesn't need to be. it accomplishes everything it wants to, and it does it perfectly.

**WillamThunderfuck** (10): As soon as I hear the little bells in the beginning I feel the spirit of Christmas taking over me, it's the most iconic Christmas song for a reason!

**zadooi** (10): Pure excellence. Nothing less. Invented Christmas.

**shhhneak** (9.8): This song hasn’t aged even a moment.

**cocosairdep** (9.5): I want it to be Christmas so badly.

**TiltControls** (9.5): one of the few christmas classics that I can listen to outside of the holiday season

**Ionlywanttheworld** (9): iconic but only once a year

**PointlessBibliophage** (9): invented straight halloween

**waluigiest** (9): me performing the alto 2 part to the choral arrangement: iiiiiiiiiiiiiii…. And iiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

**WeastofEden44** (9): A true classic, it should be the national anthem at this point

**Stryxen** (8.8): I haven’t heard this song this year yet waiting for the plug reveal lol

**camerinian** (8.5): Show us the voting data for this one, let's see that average collapse from November 1st onwards thanks to the bitter retail workers

**hikkaru** (8.5): when a christmas song wins the october rate yas

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): this is a timeless bop idc

**RandomHypnotica** (8.4): The DEFINITIVE Christmas song. Unfortunately, I'm writing this in October.

**frogaranaman** (8): overplayed but a certified slapper

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (8): i dislike christmas songs but this one can stay

**InternetDude19** (8): The first time I hear it every year is always the best time, it gets considerably worse every time after that.

**kappyko** (8): i swear

**nooodisaster** (8): I'm not in the Xmas spirit yet where my score would inflate, but this is still a damn good pop song.

**Frelock\_** (7): Catchy for a reason, but very overplayed.

**ReallyCreative** (7): if the rate was done like 3 weeks later I might give it a 10 but I'm just not in the mood

# Unfestive Folks

**CarlieScion** (6): i cant bring myself to score this higher in october

**fadedblue09** (6): It’s fine...but she literally has 2 other songs here that are infinitely better.

**ImADudeDuh** (5): im just so OVER THIS since i worked in retail for 2 years and both of them included the christmas season

**seanderlust** (5): this is a good christmas song, but I am rating it so low because I have a distinct memory of working in a department store's shoes section on black friday. it was the opening shift at midnight and I had just pounded a monster energy and I thought I was ready. this song echoed through the halls, and people came in and literally started SPRINTING DOWN THE HALLS to get like....ten dollars off a pair of knockoff ugg boots? like can you all calm down? and people were so rude like girl, get some triptophan in you from the turkey and go the fuck to sleep. it's fun tho.

**hunnybee12** (4): i'm tired

**moonagenightmares** (2): so overplayed its unbearable

**Roxieloxie** (2): i mean this is nice but is it the version with big time rush and mirranda cosgrove on it?

**cremeebrulee** (0): sorry christmas music is irritating to me regardless of who it's by :)

**KimberParoo** (0): I've worked retail sorry

**static\_int\_husp** (0): i did not do the xmas rate. i tend to loathe most xmas music. Especially this song. This song has been played non stop 2 months a year since before i was born. if i could choose to never hear a single song ever again, it would almost definitely be this one. And now you have the audacity to make me listen to this in October?? i will not stand for it.

**frogaranaman** (10): this song is attached to my most successful Tiktok post so automatic 10

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I’m pretty sure that seeing the first Mama Mia movie in theaters was what made me gay. This song is so iconic I knew all of the words to it after hearing it like once, I remember when I was in middle school someone put this on while we were just sitting around in show choir and everyone lost their minds! There’s just so much drama here, you can relate to it whether you need a man or not. (And just to be clear, I need a man.)

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (10): this song FUCKS

**ImADudeDuh** (10): This is ABBA’s best song. I feel so GAY when i dance to this.

**pat-rickstar** (10): One of the best ABBA songs, the sample from it also gave us Hung Up by Madonna so how could you not love this

**plastichaxan** (10): ABBA is the best that’s all

**ReallyCreative** (10): serving me dancing alone in my apartment every night for the last 8 months

**twat\_brained** (10): stream Gimme Gimme Rasputin

**WeastofEden44** (10): One of THEE best pop songs ever made methinks

**anothertown** (9.5): A shame that Bram Stoker never heard the theme song to the concept of vampires, just missed it by 67 years bruh

**bigbigbee** (9.5): Strings goooooood

**intheaftermath** (9.5): Unpopular opinion but I wish this song was shorter, simply because the Just Dance 2014 routine is so exhausting

**mysario** (9.5): but only until 2 am because nothing good happens after 2 am

**Stryxen** (9.5): WHY IS THIS SONG SO EXCITING it literally sounds so thrilling and dangerous

**aresthormars** (9): I love that it all starts so dark but then it just switch to a disco track. So good!

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): the winner takes it all outsold

**kirby31200** (9): I grew up on the Broadway cast recording of Mamma Mia, so that's ingrained into me and whenever I revisit real Abba I'm a little surprised by how thick the accents are

**vayyiqra** (9): Can't say I have ever felt the same but it's a bop and that synth riff is so good

**waluigiest** (9): I love the dramatic ABBA songs the most and this is close to the top

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.6): the superior abba song in this rate! i have really fond memories of singing this song with friends so i have to raise the score by at least 0.4

**Ionlywanttheworld** (8.5): I need a man

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): It's good but I'm not hearing what y'all are hearing

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): the only abba song i actually like tbh

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**cremeebrulee** (8): deserves to outpeak dancing queen

**joshually** (8): so that riff is iconic… but… the vocals are actually not that great for ABBA?

**plvstvcbvrds** (8): because of that episode of community alone, but also because this song goes slap the fuck off. madonna who?

**suhonyu** (8): mamma mia snapped with this one

**shhhneak** (7.5): Okay this song had time!

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): a bit long for what it is

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): The inferior ABBA winner. But then again I don't like Hung Up either so.

**kappyko** (7): idk after midnight i start doing stupid shit like creating taylor swift kanye feud megathreads

**steelstepladder** (7): The weaker of the two ABBA songs, but still good

# Can't Take Anymore

**fadedblue09** (6.5): This just makes me wonder why Dancing Queen didn't win in the first place.

**Frelock\_** (6): Nice, but not memorable

**starlitsuns** (6): This won the Greatest Hits rate? Over Dancing Queen? I do not get the same vibes from Dancing Queen when listening to this so perhaps this is just a me issue.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man)

**CreepyMannequin** (5.5): sounds flaccid after hearing Cher’s cover admittedly

**welcometoNY** (5): very overrated song, not that great particularly compared to the rest of ABBA's discography

**bulforster** (4.6): (#30) Its stiffness detracts from the cheesy ABBA fun for me.

**CrimsonROSET** (2.5): Good thing about the ABBA songs being right next to each other: it's very easy to tell which one is way better!

**aestheticen** (9): Every little thing that you say or… oh wrong song

**quinnpsych** (9): Prefer it when it's mashed with Hung Up, but is still a top tier song

**runaway3212** (9): Hung up is a better song, sorry :-/

**sarcasticsobs** (9): nice try, madonna (disclaimer: i love “hung  up”)

**SideBTrack8** (6.5): Hung Up >>>

**nooodisaster** (6): ima just say it... madonna (and Stuart Price) did it better.

**hikkaru** (3): the way madonna made this way better

**Roxieloxie** (3): Hung Up by Madona samples this? I hate that song so I guess this is an improvement of sorts. The track is sort of all over the place which I dont enjoy

**bbfan132** (10): right now baby i’m torn…

**worlds-okayest666** (10): i luv torn by ava max <3

**wavingwolves** (7): ava max

**PuggleMaster** (5): this song was alright didn't really care for it though, but the instrumental part that gets sampled in Torn is amazing.

# All the Comments that Mentioned Both

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Invented Madonna and Ava Max

**skargardin** (10): right now baby i'm torn

**static\_int\_husp** (10): iconic by itself. iconic when sampled by Maddona. Just kinda there when sampled by Ava Max.

**Tolk1en** (10): from Madonna to Ava, this song has inspired so many artists and must remain at the center of te pop music culture

**engifear** (9): That synth line is still everything. Don't forget it's use as a sample in Hung Up and Torn.

# The One Person Who Remembers Cher's Cover

**succulentils** (8.5): The Cher version is better

# Sorry

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): The better ABBA song in the rate. And don't you DARE mention the M word!"
4481,2020-11-28 22:01:30,k2tctw,"**aresthormars** (10): When I first heard it in Melodrama it was one of the songs that I will forever cherish because it hit me so much. Also when it is just her vocals and piano, that is so beautiful!

**AtomicViolet** (10): This would be my 11 if not for Juice

**bbfan132** (10): lorde can do no wrong

**CarlieScion** (10): OH ITS JUST ................

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Oh fuck, why wouldn't I give this song a 10? I swear, Melodrama hits hard when you actually go to college.

**fishingfor8** (10): Melodrama deserved every bit of praise it got and probably some more

**frogaranaman** (10): me every day imagining a life together with the man that has matched with me eight different times on Tinder in the past two years: but it’s just a supercut of us

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): It’s been memed to death at this point but *Melodrama* is a genuinely great album and this is by far my favorite song. It’s such a brilliant climax to the arc of the album, we’ve seen her replay this broken relationship all night and now comes the moment of clarity when she finally confronts what she’s been doing and as the memories scroll past she finally overcomes/accepts everything for what it was and this frees her to move forwards into “Perfect Places.” I have fond memories of riding my bike around the city at night after my first breakup and blasting this song. Actually… are those fond? It’s a bop regardless.

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (10): I did give supercut my eleven that one time but not today, sorry Lorde

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Lorde haters have no rights

**InternetDude19** (10): Our savior!

**Ionlywanttheworld** (10): If Running up that hill wasn't on this list this would be an eleven

**J\_Toe** (10): I still love it, but there are a collection of Jack Antonoff songs (Strawberries and Cigarettes) that use the same synth instrumentation

**jackisboredtoday** (10): wild how this is an obvious ten with no thought needed to decide that and it isn’t even top 3 on this album

**lIIustration** (10): how was this not a hit

**ManofOranges** (10): Still kinda can't believe this won the redemption rate, not like it didn't deserve it though.

**Mudkip1** (10): period

**nooodisaster** (10): This is the third time I've rated this and I'll keep giving it a 10. Lyrical masterpiece, production perfection, we cry everytime. Though now that this song has won I CAN say I think the outro is too long for normal listens and I kinda lose focus in the last 30 seconds.

**pat-rickstar** (10): No I didn’t want this to win the redemption rate. Yes I still gave it a 10 and I'll do it again. Ok?

**seanderlust** (10): me when this inevitably gets top 5: https://i.pinimg.com/originals/43/fb/05/43fb055b1be6dcbb32d36e31781ab273.jpg

**shhhneak** (10): I’ll never forgive her for making Homemade Dynamite a single over this masterpiece.

**steelstepladder** (10): People are gonna come after this because it won the redemption rate but it's still great shoot me.

**Stryxen** (10): giving this an 11 is my 2nd biggest regret in life. I will not make the same mistake

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): people in this sub wake up and play melodrama like did you even try to be happy this morning?

**TiltControls** (10): I know the Redemption rate was a mess, but I still love this song. She sounds pained in the lyrics, but still manages an upbeat performance

**twat\_brained** (10): love love LOVE this but Gimme More should be here instead

**waluigiest** (10): I adore this song. I accidentally missed the redemption rate, but this was going to be my 11. Which feels contentious to say hahahaha

**welcometoNY** (10): definitely a highlight on Melodrama, although not nearly the best song on the album or in her discography

**worlds-okayest666** (10): ok yeah this didnt deserve to win its rate but its a fucking smash so...im not gonna complain much

**RandomHypnotica** (9.6): Supercut may be like one of the most overrated songs on Melodrama, but it's still a song on Melodrama so it deserves it's score

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.5): this song always makes me want to get in my car and speed into a wall and i mean that as a compliment

**WeastofEden44** (9.5): The government does in fact have chips in our heads otherwise Lorde never would have been able to make this song specifically for me and my deep-rooted issues

**camerinian** (9): the sub tearing itself apart that this, a very good song from a classic album, won the Redemption Rate has to be the goofiest moment of the year (rest of the world notwithstanding)

**hikkaru** (9): it feels ... wrong for this to be here. don't get me wrong it's a fantastic song but it's not one of the absolute best on melodrama imo, and the album should have either stayed winnerless due the iconicness of its loss in the 2017 altpop rate OR perfect places/green light should have won as2 ...

**jsonphile** (9): not that this is a hot take at all but Melodrama is just an amazing album

**mysario** (9): it's a Twitter fancam of us

**vayyiqra** (9): inyourcartheradioup- inyourcartheradioup-

**CrimsonROSET** (8.9): This one goes out to everyone who did the Redemption rate, y'all the real ones.

**runaway3212** (8.5): This is the worst track on melodrama

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): I'm tempted to give this a 0 just because it beat Your Type in the redemption rate

**bulforster** (8): (#13) The number of times Jack has made this same song and I fall for it every single time.

**cremeebrulee** (8): ok maybe this didnt deserve to win the redemption rate but its still a bop idc

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): This win was a fluke, but the song is still good.

**Frelock\_** (8): Good lyrics, nice music, and Lorde's vocal well talents on display.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I like this song but it’s definitely a bit of a shrinker sometimes. The ending saves the song a lot

**joshually** (8): this was a great song ruined by inclusion in that terrible Netflix movie Someone Great

**kirby31200** (8): I like everything about this song except the chorus. I wish this song was a touch less sleepy. Not my favorite on the album

**ReallyCreative** (8): I'm deducting like a point and a half because it did not deserve to win, sorry about it, Perfect Places, Sober, and Homemade Dynamite are unbothered

**suhonyu** (8): i mean it's great but it rly didn't need to be supercut

**engifear** (7.8): Don't come for me, but every song on Pure Heroine is better than this song

**jasannn** (7.5): This anthemic song seemslike it would right up my lane but there's something off with it preventing me from loving it.

**WillamThunderfuck** (7.5): It's a good song, but compared to other songs on Melodrama it's just okay imo

**hunnybee12** (7): not in the mood anymore

**moonagenightmares** (7): out of all the lorde songs ….

**PuggleMaster** (7): This song was forever ruined when one of my friends said this was basically Lorde doing a Taylor Swift song.

**wavingwolves** (7): it was incredibly unsatisfying to have this win a rate so let's not do it again

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.3): not bad but...

**1998tweety** (6): Don't get me wrong I like the song but y'all overrated the entire album so much. Lorde (and I'll admit my fav Lana does this too) has the tendency to kill a good song with a 1-minute long outro. Please it is really not necessary.

**chillbumps5** (5): it's ok

**raicicle** (5): the central conceit of this song is silly

**bluehxrizon** (4): this is a good song but I dont trust lorde stans

**Roxieloxie** (4): Listen, I know we all want lorde to win a rate but we're not gonna sit here and pretend that this is even close to the best song on melodrama

**plvstvcbvrds** (3): nope. this song is all the worst parts of whatever jess glynne was doing that year. this is american ninja warrior victory montage music

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): melodrama puts me to sleep

**anothertown** (1): The way this sounds exactly like every other song on Melodrama

**fadedblue09** (1): As much as I love(d) Melodrama, I will forever be baffled to see this win, because I never considered it an album highlight. Seriously, this is just a longer and more meandering Green Light. I hope the diehard Ella stans save this because I certainly won't!

**skargardin** (1): perhaps the worst winner in rate history.

**selegend** (0): considering i gave this a 0 in its original rate, it deserves my 0 here"

**camerinian** (10): twigs is just, like, a perfect artist in every sense. Everything she does is breathtaking

**CarlieScion** (10): why ,,,,, dont i ,,,,,,,, do it ,,,, for u ,,,,!!!!

**CrimsonROSET** (10): This is proooobably my winner pick? Like, this has the biggest (I like the song)/(popheads likes the song), so I believe?

**CritneySpearz** (10): ok I used to like this song, but I literally just suffered heartbreak for the first time in my 26 years of life and now I have a completely different appreciation for the song… It hits sooo much differently ouch

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Wrist-cutting soundtrack.

**fadedblue09** (10): In hindsight this should've been an obvious 11. Even though I gave it a 10 before, somehow it's still growing on me. Ugh her power!

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I don’t even want this to win but giving it less than a ten just feels wrong, this is just a masterpiece on every level

**hunnybee12** (10): stunning, one of a kind, masterpiece

**Ionlywanttheworld** (10): beautiful and haunting

**kappyko** (10): i theoretically hate this but its actually a moment

**lIIustration** (10): she’s such a musical genius

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): just stunning. and magdalene 2019 aoty btw

**PuggleMaster** (10): I really wished I liked Magdalene as much as I loved this song.

**raicicle** (10): i think this deserves a long-lasting legacy as a pinpoint of fak twugs’ career

**RandomHypnotica** (10): The perfect ballad. Will definitely be robbed

**skargardin** (10): she snapped

**steelstepladder** (10): DIDNT I DO IT FOR YA

**Stryxen** (10): my first 11 win 🥰 and I would do it again bap bap except so hot is in this rate oop

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): I just wanna meet the guy who made background noises with his mouth for this instrumental

**twat\_brained** (10): Stop breaking Tahliah's heart or I'll fight you

**urlocalcracchead** (10): Seriously considering the eleven on this one

**waluigiest** (10): Her head voice here is so beautiful. Along with everything else - the writing, the orchestration, the shape. It’s a beautiful piece of music.

**wavingwolves** (10): fuck robert pattinson i guess

**WeastofEden44** (10): This was such a power move oh my god

**zadooi** (10): Didn't I do it for you... Such simple words that cause so much pain in my heart.

**welcometoNY** (9.9): maybe i cried

**bulforster** (9.8): (#4) Gut-wrenching.

**slimboyfriend** (9.8): the sadness I feel when she’s basically singing the same thing over and over again over two piano chords

**pat-rickstar** (9.7): It took a while for this to click with me, but it's starting to really hit

**akanewasright** (9.5): I’ve only heard this song a few times, and each time it hits me like a goddamn truck. Wonderful song, wonderfully produced and delivered.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): this normally isn’t my type of song but I think this art

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): For most of the songs in this rate, I haven't been looking at the lyrics like I usually do for most rates because I know I am going to like most, if not all, songs in the rate. But for this one, I know I had to look up the lyrics of Genius because what FKA does is ART and it should be treated as such. This is my first time listening to Cellophane and I just want to say sorry to FKA for sleeping on this song. I am going to give your album a listen kween!

**jsonphile** (9): okay I had never heard anything by FKA twigs before but wow what a powerful and sad song, especially after reading what it was about.

**ReallyCreative** (9): FKA twigs was an artist I didn't fully ""get"" until MAGDALENE but its songs like this that put her entire discography into a clearer frame, at least for me

**selegend** (9): best song of 2019

**starlitsuns** (9): I haven’t listened to any FKA twigs prior to this rate, but having seen this win the 2019 Pitchfork Rate, I’m definitely interested in listening to more of her music. Those high notes are piercingly beautiful in the chorus.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): amazing song but i can only listen to it in very specific circumstances

**seanderlust** (8.5): oof. the vocal performance of this one >>>>

**team\_kockroach** (8.5): Hot take: this is only the fourth or fifth best song on MAGDALENE, because it’s brought down a bit by the ending. It still hits hard, though.

**yatcho** (8.5): Really not even the best song off that album imo

**anothertown** (8): The thought of Twigs feeling inferior is insane because early in my relationship with my gf I saw that she was listening to LP1 and I freaked out because I thought there was no way I was interesting enough for someone who even LISTENED TO fka twigs in 2014.

**fishingfor8** (8): fka twigs is definitely a grower artist, I like this song a lot more than the last time it was rated

**kirby31200** (8): I'm certain I'll like this more when I hear it in the context of the full album

**plvstvcbvrds** (8): i wish i liked this song more than i do. the video did a lot for me, but the song itself doesn't stand without the visuals as much which is disappointing. the heel scrapes should have been included in the final version! but the song is good and unnerving and captures heartbreak so well!

**runaway3212** (8): Would be a 7 but this video is amazing.

**SmileAndTears** (7.5): The distorted piano sounds like shit but it also gives me shivers? It's incredibly sad and it just makes me feel so weird. I really don't know if I like this or not

**moonagenightmares** (7.2): kinda a snooze, the album had better songs imo

**ImADudeDuh** (7): honestly this grew on me this year. Also, i really hope someone links that video of carl weezer getting thrown into an airplane while this song plays

**Roxieloxie** (7): im balladphobic but i enjoyed the emotion

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): still don't get the hype

**AtomicViolet** (6): I feel like I should like this more than I do

**Frelock\_** (6): Technically impressive & a lot of emotion in there. Just not really my taste.

**mysario** (6): this song never did it for me and might be a bottom 5 song in this rate but it's still a great song which speaks volumes about all the other songs here

**vayyiqra** (6): Trying not to be balladophobic but I don't love this much as everyone else seems to even though I like twigs

**InfernalSolstice** (5.5): her voice is gorgeous but the song itself is kinda boring

**aestheticen** (5): Not my cup of tea sorry

**ManofOranges** (2): Sorry to this song, but I am bored. I don't know why but it just doesn't do it for me

**CarlieScion** (10): this is SOTS every summer. fight me.

**cremeebrulee** (10): THEE song of summer 2017 go argue with yourselves xoxo

**frogaranaman** (10): I listened to this song at least 25 times in a row the night it dropped and it’s still good.. iconic

**ignitethephoenix** (10): will be robbed because it has Migos in it, but I love this so much

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this song reminds me of better days gone by. OFFSET good gracious

**jasannn** (10): I overplayed the hell out of this in 2017 but it's a certified bop.

**kappyko** (10): i dont care that its kinda boring af now this was everything in 2017 <3 like yass we got fuckin amine tyler the creator rex orange county sza vince staples brockhampton it was an era really

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): this song. this song makes me want to be drunk wandering around downtown from store to store during first fridays and looking at art pieces i can't afford and testing out tapas at a restaurant i wouldn't go to normally because it's overpriced and ugh it's just so summer, but in a really specific way that i will always love.

**Roxieloxie** (10): Holy shit, I did not know the name of this song. The only party I got to go to in 2020, back in February was my friends 18th birthday and it was this big gay dance party in a basement. I have so many videos of all of us dancing to this song but i never knew the name of it. Hearing this just really takes me back to the vibe that I thought 2020 was gonna be

**sarcasticsobs** (10): S-tier summer song

**steelstepladder** (10): Of course I'm gonna give the winner of my rate a 10

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): I really want an update on if Frank Ocean purchased *Boy With A Pipe* (1905, Oil on Canvas)

**urlocalcracchead** (10): I hate the migos feature but my husband frank really came on this

**waluigiest** (10): song of the summer 2017 if you’re gay

**wavingwolves** (10): this is a top 5 song so please let it be top 5

**yatcho** (10): I still can't believe Calvin Harris produced this funky masterpiece?? It still sounds fresh as hell

**seanderlust** (9.8): this is absolute pure vibe music.

**jackisboredtoday** (9.6): classic… when funk wav singles were dropping, that was a moment™

**anothertown** (9): A subtle, effective, evocative, yet boppy mood piece

**bespectacIed** (9): Great rate! Obvious but deserving winner. True Blue is for highbrow minds only

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): I have a feeling this song is going to go out on Day 1. I hope I am wrong though cause despite the remorse and grudge that I have for Calvin Harris, this song fucking slaps. [Throwback to that time he blocked me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/drwhowhenhowwhy/status/976625115206098944)

**engifear** (9): The vibes are immaculate. Perfect addition to any chill out playlist

**fishingfor8** (9): I'd empty my bank account for Frank to do another dance track

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Back in 2017 when this came out (what a year) I remember everyone absolutely lost their minds over it and everyone was BEGGING Calvin Harris to make it a single, and somehow despite all that buzz I never actually listened to it? I should have though because this is great! There’s such a specific mood here, the sort of “summer bummer / too cool to sound enthusiastic” thing that every autotuned hip-pop-rap boy chases but can’t quite manage to nail like these guys did. This song just melts all over your brain.

**Ionlywanttheworld** (9): the bassline gets me

**ManofOranges** (9): Honestly don't really care for any of the verses in this song--except for maybe Offset's--because the production and hook is where it's at here. It's just so damn good, I love it

**runaway3212** (9): this would be a 10 but this video is offensively boring, like just a picture of the album would be better.

**SmileAndTears** (9): I hate that sample so much

**worlds-okayest666** (9): would be a ten but i find the high pitched frank vocals in the beginning so annoying im sorry...

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.6): great song

**twat\_brained** (8.6): I think this would've worked better with someone like Anderson instead of Migos but then again this is probably the most tolerable Migos sound to me next to ""Bon Appétit"" or ""Stir Fry"".

**lIIustration** (8.5): This is a 10 with better rapping, Frank kills this.

**InternetDude19** (8.1): I don't care for any of these artists but somehow they work extremely well together.

**1998tweety** (8): shes a cute chill bop

**akanewasright** (8): What a fucking smooth song.

**mysario** (8): the first 30 seconds can be binned but after that is groovy city

**quinnpsych** (8): Again, what a great summer song, Frank Ocean literally doesn't have a bad song in my opinion

**ReallyCreative** (8): it's pleasant, it's fun, but there's a lot of stuff in this rate that is more pleasant, more fun

**starlitsuns** (8): are you a $100M picasso painting or are you the girl in frank ocean's relationship because only one is worth the money

**Stryxen** (8): whenever I hear this song I think of todd in the shadows because he had a nice speech about this song once

**slimboyfriend** (7.9): yes Frank Ocean is on it, but at the end of the day it’s still a basic Calvin Harris EDM track

**suhonyu** (7.5): she was cute when it came out but that's it, didn't really age well

**pat-rickstar** (7.3): I still kind of don't get the hype for this but it's pleasant enough to listen to I guess

**aresthormars** (7): Groovy but I got bored when Migos jumped in the track.

**PuggleMaster** (7): Calvin & Frank snapped but M*gos really brought this song down for me....

# Still Bitter About How He Sabotaged Rita Ora

**CrimsonROSET** (6.2): Song of the summer, yadda yadda, don't know why it's not hitting this hard. Maybe I'm still bitter about RAM getting robbed, maybe it's because we can't actually go out there and party to it.

**bulforster** (6): (#23) Migos are popheads rate winners and Charli is not, love that.

**cocosairdep** (6): This might be an unpopular opinion, but I hated the high pitched voice, it’s super annoying and it really kills the vibe for me.

**joshually** (6): it’s merely okay

**selegend** (6): would be so much better without the pitched vocals

**vayyiqra** (6): This is okay but I'm still mad it won a rate against two albums that were stacked with better songs

**Tolk1en** (5): not convinced by the vocals, not convinced by this lazy beat

**welcometoNY** (5): i used to love this song but coming back to it, it's just not as special as i remember. it doesn't help that every artist here is a pretty shitty person. i appreciate the general sound he was going for, but the magic is just lost for me.

**WillamThunderfuck** (5): it's a song featuring only men, which is exactly what it sounds like

**moonagenightmares** (4.5): can’t believe i had to sit through migos

**bluehxrizon** (4): cursed period of time associated with this

**cloudbustingmp3** (4): blah

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): im sorry but i dont get the hype around this song at all. nothing happens in this

**Frelock\_** (3): Not really my style. When the only memorable part of this is a two word phrase. ""I might"" not remember this.

**fadedblue09** (2): You know a song is crap when an Offset verse is somehow the highlight of the whole thing.

**nooodisaster** (2): im..... falling....... asleep........

**ElizabethDDoS** (1): This should not have won in a rate with Nothing Breaks Like a Heart, Instant Crush and Giorgio by Moroder but oh well, I didn't do that one, did I?

**plastichaxan** (1): Do I like high pitched stuff? absolutely. Do I find this song obnoxious? very (sorry Frank I love you)

**wanderingimpromptu3** (1): Don't like the singer's voice and something about the production is grating, also doesn't really fit together"

**nooodisaster** (10): A stunning ode to long-term love. The thesis is basically ""Fuck it, it works"" but Paramore makes it sound revolutionary, life-affirming, and most importantly, forever. A worthy winner.

**runaway3212** (10): An unparalleled track

**skargardin** (10): they snapped

**Stryxen** (10): Hayley can do anything and I will just 🥰🥰🥰🥰

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): fun fact that many paramore fans may not know about: this is actually the First song to ever be recorded! thank you Hayley

**TiltControls** (10): One of 2 songs to get a higher score for me on rerate. I don't know why this took so long to grow on me after the original rate. It's the best song on the album

**twat\_brained** (10): Who can really hate this song? Moreover, who can't relate to this at least a *little*?

**welcometoNY** (10): an absolute gem of a song, i've returned to it over and over for years and it just never gets old.

**worlds-okayest666** (10): that was a classic, that was a classic

**1998tweety** (9.5): massive bop, I know I'm basic for saying it but this is one of their bests

**CrimsonROSET** (9.5): Is it overrated as fuck? Yes. Doesn't mean it isn't fucking great.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): cute!

**mysario** (9.5): I'm still into poo 🥺

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.2): this song is so cute

**camerinian** (9): yeah you know what traditional values of love are fucking rad and I will flex my successful long term relationship thank you very much

**Ionlywanttheworld** (9): I remember seeing the video of her in the studio nailing the vocals for this and I stan

**lIIustration** (9): ariana did into you better but this is still good

**waluigiest** (9): I don’t care if it’s cheesy I love the writing

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.9): im still into this song!

**PuggleMaster** (8.5): This was a cute era for Paramore but I liked Ain't It Fun more.

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): it's a very mid song from self-titled but that still means its great

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): Again, I don't like Hayley's voice. If this had been Kelly Clarkson or Mitski or P!nk or anyone else this would've been a 10

**starlitsuns** (8.5): Remember 2014 when this was all over the radio? I miss those days.

**akanewasright** (7.5): This song sounds like 8th grade, but like... in an okay way

**yatcho** (7.5): Cute bop but not even one of their best

**Frelock\_** (7): It's nice and upbeat.

**steelstepladder** (7): It's fun! But that's kinda it.

# Not Into It  

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): I think I am still a bit scared of the rock aspects of this song that keep me and I’m not usually a huge fan of acoustic covers of songs but the acoustic version of this song that Ashley Tisdale did with her husband really elevated the song for me and helped me understand the lyrics/bones of the song a bit more so I would say that I like it a bit.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.4): call me bitter but this isn’t one of the Paramore songs that deserves to be here

**anothertown** (6): Proof deserved

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): I like their poppier stuff way more.

**seanderlust** (5.7): this one never did it for me, although I do weirdly like it more now that after laughter came out.

**vayyiqra** (5): Not too into this :pensive:

**wavingwolves** (5): i love paramore but this is one of the weaker songs on self titled and ain't it fun deserved to be here

**bulforster** (1): (#48) God this is so grating, glad to know the guy it's about is awful. I quite like Paramore's self-titled but y'all really gave the win to my least fav track when Ain't It Fun was right there?"

For a song that's become the defining soundtrack for one of the best-selling game consoles of all time, there's not a whole lot of information online about the song. It appears to have been composed by Kazumi Totaka, who you might know for voicing Yoshi, and for [hiding melodies in many soundtracks he's worked on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gsqD-8dYcs). And...that's basically all that I can find on it! There's the obvious information, like how this basic, looping melody plays as you designed little Mii characters, but if you were an adolescent in the late 2000s, you probably know about how that works.

This song's sheer omnipresence as a cultural force is the largest factor into it becoming a meme — anything that gets popular enough inevitably spawns humorous takes on it. But there's still a great little song at the core of it. The song plays with a simple violin and the blippy boops of a synth, like a delicate balance between the old and the new that perfectly encapsulates the charm of the Wii system. It's relaxing despite being relatively upbeat, making it ideal for the simple but slow process of crafting the perfect Mii. If anything, this should be higher — not just because it's a fun meme and y'all seem to hate fun way too much, but because it is genuinely an excellent composition that has withstood the test of time.

**jackisboredtoday** (11): I maintain that the Wii Shop Channel Theme should have been chosen instead, but I just got extremely lucky & won a switch lite literally the day I filled out this rate so I guess this is my 11 now

**pat-rickstar** (11): Imagine if this actually wins! I'd better see 11s across the board for this timeless classic aka the M11 Channel Theme

**RandomHypnotica** (11): Anyone who gave this a 10 is a coward, and they know it. I'm also going to use this opportunity to recommend some other incredible Wii OS bops such as Submission Plaza Theme, Contest Winner Parade and The Everybody Votes Channel Main Theme

**Roxieloxie** (11): if im the only 11 for this song im gonna be so mad

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (11): this is in ironically the best instrumentation in this entire rate, I literally used to leave the shop on in the background as a child and for that, this is the only good piece of music to ever be recorded. Thank you

**zadooi** (11): Yes it's a meme song, but it's a meme song that slaps. Next question."

For the many, many people confused by how Ms. 500k YouTube Views ended up in this rate, she won a smol event called /r/popheads Worldvision where users were invited to submit ~~noname trash~~ under-the-radar artists from various countries around the world, and we would then vote Eurovision style on which songs we liked the most. Of course, the final songs were all in English and came from Anglo-Saxon countries, with Hanne Mjøen taking the victory for Norway. I'm usually partial to the rate underdogs, but this is such boilerplate scandipop Spotify pap, from the generic churning beat to the most bananas and avocados voice imaginable, that I really can't muster the energy to defend her. Also a voter pointed out that her Instagram highlights used to titled with an ableist pejorative so, like, I really can't be assed to write much else. Bye!"

> Can you feel that? Carole King sure can. “I Feel the Earth Move” was an undeniable competitor in the Women in Music: 1971 rate. Known for its rollicking piano melody, King’s vocal performance, and the all-too-familiar feelings of seeing a lover, “I Feel the Earth Move” was an early contender for the top spot in its original rate and maintained its status as the submissions kept tumbling in. On an album full of classic pop tunes that are familiar to any ear, “I Feel the Earth Move” was in a good spot to be remembered, opening Tapestry with bombast; the mellower tracks on the album follow, weaving a portrait of young love and artistry. Next June, “I Feel the Earth Move” will celebrate 50 years since peaking at number one on the Hot 100, proving that a good song that can get your heart trembling will forever be timeless. - /u/whtrblckhl

---

So after the previous reveal it should be noted that Wikipedia is a great resource for making these writeups, and I want to bring special attention to the entry for this song in particular:

> Music journalist Harvey Kubernik wrote that ""I Feel the Earth Move"" was ""probably the most sexually aggressive song on the Tapestry album"" and a ""brave"" opening to an album whose mood is mostly ""mellow confessionality"". AllMusic critic Stewart Mason describes the song as ""the ultimate in hippie-chick eroticism"" and writes that it ""sounds like the unleashing of an entire generation of soft-spoken college girls' collective libidos"".

Yes, you heard it here first: ""I Feel the Earth Move"" was indeed the ""WAP"" of the 1970s, and Carole Thee King was the horniest force in pop music at the time. All jokes aside, there is definitively an erotic element to this song. If you do empty your mind a bit and listen to the song, and you hear her coos interspersed with the banging of that piano, you may indeed find yourself just a little turned on. Carole's raw but catchy lyricism and her natural ear for pop melodies come fully through on this track, and it makes for a walloping good time.

This song was a mega smash (I mean, I wouldn't know personally — I'm 12 :/ ), becoming one of the biggest hits of 1971 and peaking at #1 for five weeks. Just imagine the number of libidos she set on fire during that reign! Your fave could never."

> I know I sound basic saying it but wow this song really is pop perfection. I actually love it when songs take their time to build up, we go nearly a full minute before that epic chorus kicks in and releases that delicious serotonin to my brain. I could write a whole essay on that chorus and how it solved world hunger, ended climate change, and finally found me a boyfriend; three events of equal importance.

>  And just like my university assignments, the song doesn't let up! The next verse and pre-chorus have more going on than their prior counterparts and before you know it we're back in the chorus but this time with added adlibs! I love when songs make an effort to make their choruses sound slightly different so adlibs are often the easy way to go about it. Thankfully, Little Mix are kind of know for serving adlibs and harmonies. Finally we get to the bridge and last chorus and WOW I'm ascending. Call me Dua Lipa cause I'm Levitating, call me Katy Perry cause I'm Rise-ing off of the ground, Call Me Maybe (please call me I'm lonely). I can't think of a better moment in modern pop history, so please just go listen to it for yourself. I love how each girl gets her chance to shine on the track: Leigh does a really great job starting the song off, Jesy's sultry vocals match the vibe of the track perfectly, Perrie's adlibs on the bridge and 2nd chorus take it to a whole new level, and of course Jade always delivers stellar vocals. Do yourself a favor and watch the video for this cause not only are the guys HOT, the choreo is iconic too! and I lowkey like Perrie's weird corset oop 

> Anyways, I will be sad to see this get robbed and go out early Day 2! - /u/1998tweety [host note: erm, about that...]

---

Little Mix have always been expert bopmakers, and ""Touch"" is perhaps their biggest bop of the past few years. *Glory Days* was a solid album with a title that seems all the more poignant as we hear more about their label difficulties and disbandment rumors, and while ""Touch"" wasn't the biggest hit from that era, it's become perhaps that era's most defining. Sleek and sexy, it's a prime song for throwing your back out or pounding your taint into the floor. I love the chaotic adlibs that tumble over the final chorus, and the way the drop manages to bring energy without suffocating the song in noise. Let's continue to pretend the Kid Ink version doesn't exist and appreciate the fact that Jess Glynne is not in this rate."

> This was the winner in the first rate I ever hosted and I cannot get over how iconic it was seeing Bleachers going from being slaughtered during the first two days, to winning the main, bonus and songeniality rates. The song itself has aged really well - it's the pinnacle of Jack's signature 80's synth-pop sound (yes, even more than Cruel Summer).  Also it was really fun to make [THIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gc-xUYn4Kz0) video. - /u/CarlieScion

---

And so Jack Antonoff makes his departure from the rate, right on the cusp of day 2. Well, I guess ""Supercut"" is still in at least, so just like in real life, his production credits get far more acclaim than his actual solo projects. Go stream ""Chinatown (feat. Bruce Springsteen)"" to make up for that.

Speaking of Lorde, she also contributes backing vocals to this little ode to... *sigh* Lena Dunham, and I think even the faintest sound of her voice is responsible for at least a third of the total points /r/popheads gave the song. The rest of the points are because ""Don't Take The Money"" is an infectious bop, where Jack's synthwork is arguably at his best. It's bouncy and smooth and explosive right where it needs to be. While I do find his production work to be repetitive, and even on this track he does a lot of the same tricks he does on his other songs, it's still a treat to her an artist perfect the style that their career is built off of, and this song is no exception.

> Taylor finally did it, and narrowly too. The rate itself was just an odd experience to look back on, and the song itself is even stranger in the context of this rate. I wasn't told the positions of the songs, but I would definitely not be surprised if this is out late day one or early day two. It's shocking that the song won to begin with, a ballad from a country album that wasn't a single managed to win, plus that shit is looooooooong

> The song itself though is a masterpiece, and it actually increased in its overall rank of Taylor's songs in the most recent Top Ten Pop Ten, up to #5 overall in her discography. The opening lines are smooth like butter, and it is a song that I think is going to be hurt by her re-recordings. A lot of the album, Speak Now, benefits from being self-written, and also being sung and performed in a vocal phase that was starting to mature from her Fearless sound, but still had tinges of sharper inflections and sharper tones. That sound from her voice really fleshed out the emotion of the song, and it felt like an even more vivid painting of a Romeo & Juliet love story, moreso than Love Story itself. 

> It's a perfect storm of youth, longing, intellect, and emotion that make this slow-burner of a ballad resonate with so many, and why it is being rated again here. - /u/wailord_fan

---

Can you believe that out of Taylor's [105 fucking songs we've rated](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard#wiki_most_songs_rated), this is the only one to actually win? I mean, that's one more than I honestly thought she would have (and she only made it here by less than a point over a mediocre Carrie Underwood song), but still! And she did way worse in this rate than I expected, too; she never once crossed out of day 1 territory as the results were coming in. People would be handing out 9s and 10s to everything else, only to smack Taylor with a 5 and a disparaging comment. Where did her fans go? I guess it's true that all Swifties do is doxx people, abandon her in rates, eat hot chip, and [lie](https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/jrp9b6/esquire_three_years_after_reputation_its_time_to/).

That all being said, ""Enchanted"" is easily one of Taylor's best songs, and a deserving representation of her work in this rate. Taylor has long been a reactive artist, and I buy into the idea that after people doubted her songwriting craft after her AOTY win for ""Fearless,"" she went out of her way to pen an entire album by herself to really show off her abilities. It paid off, and ""Enchanted"" is the biggest gem of the album, Apparently written about Adam Young, AKA the Owl City dude, it details the tumulting emotions that come when you meet someone so alluring for the first time — someone so spellbinding that it renders your entire night bright and sparkly. It's a power ballad that still holds up, and it represents a unique phase in her career right as she was on the cusp of going full-on pop star."

> This was a really fun rate to host, just because everyone had such differing opinions. In the end, this came out victorious. I'm not really sure if it was deserved, because Niall definetly had better songs on his album and (in my personal opinion) both Zayn and Harry had way more exciting music. However, I forgive Niall because of his cute Irish accent and smile. Damn him. - /u/CarlieScion

---

Pop quiz: For the 2017 year-end wrap up here on /r/popheads, whose album had the most requests for writeups? You might be surprised to learn that it was, of all the things that came out that year, Niall's country-ish work, *Flicker*. There's a number of reasonable excuses for this — there's always been a lot of Directioners here, and his album wasn't omega popular enough to be seen as highly sought, so people thought they had a good chance of getting his writeup. But there's also the simple fact that his album was pretty decent, especially coming from an ex-1D member without the biggest expectations for his solo work. Yet his album was quite nice, and it even snagged a decent hit worldwide.

""On The Loose"" is not that hit, but it is still the crown jewel of *Flicker*. It's a perfect song for driving with the top down through the city, the cool nighttime air streaming through your hair. The energy may be laidback but it's still propelling you forward, resulting in an irresistable charm as long as you don't pay too much attention to the lyrics. Niall's career may be far from the biggest out of the 1D boys, but he's shown that he's more than capable of churning out a solid tune, and his victory over his bandmates in that rate is proof of that."

""Mirrors"", the winner of the 2010s Ultimate Mens Rate, is a top song of Justin Timberlake's discography and arguably his magnum opus. off of his massively influential The 20/20 Experience and one of the longest winners in r/popheads rate history clocking in at 8:05, the song may come off daunting but Justin delivers a hauntingly beautiful reflection (hehe) on finding that other someone who perfectly completes you. paired with one of the most beautiful music videos directed almost guaranteed to bring a tear to your eye, this home run of a song deserves all the love given to it.

 > anyways do the mens rate - /u/frogaranaman

To all the people who complained about this song being too long: I PUT THE RADIO EDIT IN THE PLAYLISTS FOR A REASON!!! DID YOU GO OUT OF YOUR WAY TO LISTEN TO THE WHOLE-ASS THING JUST TO BE ABLE TO DRAG IT??? I hate how overwrought the original ""Mirrors"" track is, as well as almost every other song from its parent album, so there's a reason I tried to help both y'all and this song by linking the edit. Why did y'all torture yourselves with the entire thing? Did you watch the music video or something? I know it won video of the year or some shit, but that doesn't mean it's worth eight minutes of your time!

This song is fine. When Justin had his big ol' comeback in 2013, I loved the swagger of ""Suit & Tie"" (which had not aged the best tbh) and much preferred it over ""Mirrors,"" which I thought was a little boring. I still don't enjoy the filtered effect placed on his voice in the chorus, but I can see the intentions behind putting that aural distance between himself and the listener. I will say that it's probably a small victory for him and for men in general that this song isn't in dead last. Good job Justin!

> Caution was what what many consider a return to form for Miss Mariah after a long slump and with this rate winning song she proved her sharp songwriting wit and ear for infections pop melodies with a hip hop blend still held up. A No No effortlessly combines an extremely fun, punchy backing track (with an excellent Crush on You sample) with some really shady lines rivaling the best in her career a la' Obsessed. As a new Mariah single from an under-listened album I know this will probably be overlooked in this rate which is a shame, if only she released that Lil Kim/Missy Elliot/ Cardi remix for an 11 average - /u/yatcho 

---

Mariah's divaness and past catalogue are discussed so much that sometimes her genuinely great recent work is overlooked. *Caution* was an incredible album, and ""A No No"" one of its strongest songs. It combines so many quintiseentially Mariah things - gratuitously flowery vocabulary, a simmering R&B instrumental, and an air of being way too cool for whatever you're offering her. It's the kind of song that goes down real smooth and warms you right up, which the best Mariah songs often excel at.

The original rate matchup was a little skewed — we really just threw together four monosyllabic albums by four female pop stars — but it was fun to see Mariah get her reward for making the best album of the bunch. This wasn't the track I was personally rooting for, but it's more than earned its place here despite its less than stellar placement."

> I am very upset Bleachers didn't win the rate. However, I am also upset that CHVRCHES didn't win the rate either. HOWEVER, I am glad that this is the 1975 song that won (even tho Love Me still outpeaked). What a pulsing groove throughout the song, which is good cause Matt is such an angry, petty bitch here. It really shouldnt work as well as it does. I'm assuming that's why it's going out at #46. But r/popheads has never cared for men and has been very conflicted on The 1975. It's a great song! - /u/ImADudeDuh 

> I was still young when i first heard this song. With my head in the clouds, hands in my pockets, toes poking out the holes in my socks i was a much different person to who i am now. The best i can do is describe it as somewhere between innocence and unknowing but i think that's just being young. I was just in that kind of honeymoon phase of life where hours feel like lifetimes and things get wrapped up nicely in little red bows. I think the best part about being young is just the unbelievability of the world. It's not the feeling of invincibility that gets you but its the rush of blood and seeing another day. it's not the all consuming vortex of young love its the uncontainable passion that doesnt make sense. it's not that things don't end but its that every time they do they are dramatic and vivid and sometimes even a little bit tragic. And i guess you just kinda live these not quite lies and not quite truths until you wake up one day and you can suddenly give more precise answers and you know that youre grown. its so romantic to cling to the ideals of a tunnel song or a last dance at prom but for the average person things just dont end like that. I remember my first love. She had soft blue eyes, skinny and tender hands, and a dump truck ass. She wasn't there the first time i heard this song but i think about her every time i hear it now. and that all represents something to me. i never got to hear the end of the tunnel song or even go to prom. i constantly look back at these moments and emotions i didnt get a chance to feel and for some reason it always leads me back to this song. and i can tell you its for sure because its the song i can imagine myself in all those situations just absolutely fucking losing it in my coming of age moment. This song is so special to me because it is a reminder of the past but its also a stamp on to say ""hey its finished you dont have to go back there"".N)> its an end to an end of itself. it's the pink rimmed edges of a john green book. its the car ride home after a really fun night. its so much thats not being said and can't be said anymore. its youth and its passion and its obsession and its trying to be cooler than you really are and its hoping for the best and its just not giving a fuck for a couple minutes. its a whole damn motherfucking vibe and god i wish i had been young enough to grow up with this song - /u/FranklyTheTurtle

The 1975's pretension has doomed many a song and many an album from them, but sometimes they're capable of channeling their haughtiness into a fun tune. Like several songs off of its parent album whose full title I can't be bothered to retype out here, ""The Sound"" plays out a conversation between a douche and his lover as they bicker about love and and shoes and the beating of her heart, whose sound is evidence enough to the man that she really does love him in spite of everything. The song is then draped in both upbeat, boppy synths and a deluge of SAT vocabulary, which makes for weird interstital material as he alternates between talking about her skin and how he's a ""sycophantic, prophetic, Socratic junkie wannabe"". The music video just adds to it, which displays them in a glass cube while critics lobby harsh (but, in retrospect, sometimes not untrue) criticism towards them while Matty Healy mopily gazes out and continues to sing. It's a fun blend of differing attitudes and styles, and a great showcase of how they're sometimes capable of channeling their artistry into something fun and approachable."

> In between FROOT and L+F Marina lost her way a bit. In a search to become a more ""serious"" artist she forwent what made up her artistic palette in the first place. The title track from her most consistent project, FROOT, is a wonderful midpoint. Popheads certainly agreed when it blasted far ahead of little Miss Reycist and Miss Florence. FROOT's mature disco-pop direction pairs so well with its nonsense lyrics, so nonsensical and corny that it becomes pure bliss. Honestly I'm unsure how this will fair in the winners rate, and that's okay, cause Marina has never been defined by her, erm, numbers, but instead her bold artistic decisions that make FROOT one of her most defining songs. - /u/Therokinrolla

---

Oh Marina, good on you for making it into another one of these winners rates — and for beating out Florence again! Marina gets a lot of flack these days for being poor or something, but I've always liked her wistful brand of alternative pop that the *Froot* era really built up. The title track here is extravagant and playful, with perhaps the sexiest use of the word ""cauliflower"" ever, and I believe represents the epitome of what's made Marina and her music endearing. It's long and slow, but when compared to artists like Lana or Florence, I appreciate how ready Marina is to not take herself too seriously.

> This was such a boring win. We all saw Paramore sweeping the Emo Rate 1.5 coming from a mile away, but why oh why did this have to be the winner? It's a good song, but the rate had much more interesting and iconic songs - like Decode, 20 Dollar Nosebleed and The Ballad of Mona Lisa. Damn you Popheads for being basic af - /u/CarlieScion 

 > Hello! This (Emo Rate 1.5) was the first rate I hosted and it was with the lovely CarlieScion! Outside of one point where ""New Perspective"" had a brief lead, this never left first place. The rest of the top 10 was a chaotic mess but y'all agreed that this song is the best of the Paramore songs on this album (and against two underrated flop albums RIP)! It starts off hitting HARD and you know what you're getting from the get go! The harmonies are beautifully done, the band works as tight as ever, and Hayley does a great job lyrically building more than a house here - and it's all wrapped up in a catchy bow! It's undoubtedly one of Paramore's BA-DA-BA BA-DA BA BA BEST! - /u/mysario

Reception

The song received generally positive reviews from critics. Alex Fletcher of Digital Spy, who gave the song 4 stars out of 5. He said the song is ""infectious, deliciously dark ('Well go get your shovel, and we'll dig a deep hole'), and packed with more energy than a Jedward dance routine – Williams sounds downright tremendous leading the 'ba-ba-ba' climax – this should provide a welcome edge at the top end of the charts"".[2] Rolling Stone stated that ""Brick by Boring Brick"" was able to ""weave unexpected Smashing Pumpkins-style sonics into the mix.""[3] The song received a positive review from Vicki Lutas of the BBC, who awarded the song 5 out of 5 stars. She said that the song is ""hair-raisingly BRILLIANT"" and said ""Listening to the lyrics is like entering a world where sandcastles aren't built, but buried, a world where the baddie is not the wolf, but reality... and in this world, things are dark, but they're very real. There's a sense of longing; longing for those fairy tales and longing for innocence, but it's coupled with a sense of realization that this will never happen.""[4]"

> In a stacked rate full of songs that brought back some pretty fun childhood memories, there were a few albums that reminded us of why maybe it's better for the past to stay in the past. As seen by the ranking Kiss and Tell illustrated this best. Freeways and I thought this was arguably the weakest choice out of all the songs to win, but you know what sometimes you end up with a solid, inoffensive bop taking first place and you just have to accept that. - /u/Roxieloxie 

 > When you need a dose of nostalgia-infused serotonin, old Disney Channel is usually the way to go. 7 Things and Burnin' Up almost won, but popheads decided Naturally was their best go-to song for childhood memories.

Poor Selena. It was obvious she was never going to get very high, but I didn't really think she'd be *all* the way at the bottom. I was certain that spot was reserved for one of the mediocre white men in this rate! But I suppose /r/popheads is full of surprises.

""Naturally"" was not Selena (Gomez & The Scene)'s debut, but it was arguably her (their?) first to make waves outside of the Disneysphere that she had been incubated in. I remember all the way back in 2009 when this was getting some critical attention — I think Billboard even listed this as one of the top 20 songs of the year or something. In retrospect it was probably a warning of how Selena would continue to receive a surprising amount of critical accolades well into her career, but at the time it just felt like an appropriate evaluation of a solid pop tune. Who can resist that pulsating club-lite beat supporting Selena's bubbly little voice and she rings out the most PG lyrics ever? If you told me this was a Eurodance single that never charted on the Hot 100 I'd probably believe you, and I'd probably still bop along.

This song comes from a rate of the Disney Channel golden era, where she somehow beat out Demi Lovato, Miley Cyrus, and the Jonas Brothers despite having a...significantly worse album that overall performed way worse than everyone else's. I guess this makes her the Whitey Houston of the Disney rates? My car's audio system [insists that she's Dionne Warwick](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/532698515957350410/777307438315339806/image0.jpg?width=878&height=1171), so I guess that's not too far off."

> Kesha was one of the defining forces of the early 10s pop scene, with her first two projects spawning multiple smash hits and classic songs we all remember today. But after Die Young, which ended up falling short of the win in the 2012 Ultimate rate, her chart success began to dwindle with this song in particular. It's truly tragic what happened with C'Mon on the charts - it's a sugary sweet ode to simply living one's young life to the fullest in a way that blends early Kesha's more trashy party girl vibe with production, vocals, and overall lyrical sentiment that makes the song drip with nostalgia, a drug that many popheads users cannot get enough of when it comes to the music of the early 10s. Thankfully, because of that, it was awarded the win over bigger hits like Die Young as well as songs from Nicki and Rihanna, and when hosting this rate I couldn't have been happier, as it's one of Kesha's best in my opinion. - /u/hikkaru

---

Every big pop star has that one song that manages to define themselves. For Gaga it'd be the gritty but irresistible ""Bad Romance""; for Katy it's the weightless and effervescent ""Teenage Dream"". For Kesha, it is not ""C'Mon,"" but if did manage to not be her first single to not reach the top 10 of the Hot 100, I'd bet good money on it becoming one of her defining tracks. It's so perfectly Kesha, from the tumult of bonkers rhymes in the second verse (who else would rhyme ""sabertooth tiger"" with ""Budweiser""?) and the slightly crass but still charming way that she rings out the chorus. And above all else, it's the way that this song invites you to join in on the fun that's always defined Kesha's artistry. She always wants you to join in on the fun, no matter what she's doing, and the sheer joy exhibited in this song makes it so difficult to say no.

> Young and Beautiful is Lana Del Ray at her best. The orchestra, her longing voice, and the overabundance of adjectives all come together and transport you to the sorrow scene she describes. Even a Lorde lover like me, who was rooting for a dark horse Yellow Flicker Beat win, couldn’t be mad at this win because it was completely deserved. - /u/Strawberryswing1

---

Question for the culture: Even though Lana Del Rey is a frequent appearance on random movie soundtracks, where did she begin her reign as one of the premiere movie chanteuses? The answer is, of course, the moody and dreary ""Young and Beautiful,"" which employs this particularly moody and dreary version of her (which has thankfully evolved when it comes to her albums) that's present in many of her soundtrack songs — even when [it absolutely does not fit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leopt__ATR0). 

""Young and Beautiful"" came out in early 2013 as the *Born to Die* era was dying down, and it was ostensibly written for the *Paradise Edition* originally. She even brought it up in an interview along with ""Body Electric"" and ""Gods and Monsters,"" but while both the song that mangles Walt Whitman poetry and the song about dropping it like it's hot in the pale moonlight made it onto that EP, ""Young and Beautiful"" was the one placed on the back burner? Lana's questionable taste aside, the origin of ""Young and Beautiful"" makes sense when you listen to it. It's a great distillation of the BTD era and, if anything, a proper send-off. Here, Lana is entering full Lana Del Rey Mode, with a somber orchestra providing the moody backdrop as she coos about her usual topics. The summer nights are hot, the diamonds are brilliant, the soul is aching, and all that jazz. It's glamorous and evocative yet distinctly shallow, which is pretty much how I'd describe her early work as well as the general culture of the Roaring 20s, where the movie is set.

With all of this in mind, I...don't think the lyrics have a whole lot to do with *The Great Gatsby*, like how she references Bel Air despite the story taking place in New York. Lana said she intended to write this from Daisy's perspective, but the affection Daisy had from both of her lovers never seemed dependent on her youth, and the song's preoccupation with how that love may be fleeting doesn't match up with the book's themes about the characters being beaten back ceaselessly into the past. Still, the song's haunting nature juxtaposed with its gaudy lyricism fits the mood of the movie so acutely, and Lana as an artist was just perfect for that soundtrack. it's not a surprised it won the rate, in spite of its middling performance in this one. Even though it's rarely brought up in the Lana canon nowadays, I find it strangely symbolic of her early career. It was a proper coda to her breakout era, and a mellifluous entry point into the literal Hollywood pictures that have always informed her artistry.

---
**cocosairdep** (11): This song is so beautiful, it feels so timeless. It remains one of Lana’s best songs, beyond a shadow of a doubt. I still can’t believe how it lost the Grammy to Skyfall."

> In my country, where Mulan's singing actress, Lea Salonga, comes from, Reflection is the most iconic scene in this movie. In other countries, it's probably I'll Make a Man Out Of You instead; the two songs ended up ranking side by side when they topped our Disney rate, and although I was a little bitter that the former didn't end up winning despite being the quintessential gay Filipino anthem, there's also hardly anything else that matches the perfect combination of humor, camp, and sheer awesomeness of its companion. Let's all make sure to fondly revisit this masterpiece of watching the new remake that actually butchers Chinese culture even more! - /u/yourhostandpatron

---

The Disney animanted story of *Mulan* hinges on two songs. The first is ""Reflection,"" a delicate, tender song about Mulan trying to overcome the expectations set forth by her gender identity. It's emotional and evocative and takes its time to really build up her sorrow and pain. The second is ""I'll Make a Man Out of You,"" which acts as a foil in a way by providing the manly counterpoint to ""Reflection""'s feminity. It's an overtly sexist song coming from the movie's most masculine character, and it lays forth what Mulan needs to do to accomplish her goal. Like ""Reflection,"" it's about the expectations set forth by one's gender, but this time for men. The song is clear as, above the choral chants of ""be a man,"" it explains that men are swift, strong, mysterious, and all these adjectives that are intentionally cliche and vague. 

There are a lot of criticisms to be made about ""Mulan,"" especially now that in 2020 it's become a political talking point, but I saw some comments paint this as sexist, which it is, but it approaches that topic from a subversive angle. The entire story is about a cis woman who manages to meet and surpass the definitions of a man that this very song sets out for her, and you need this uber macho song in order to convey these ridiculous expectations, just so they can be dismantled later. It also helps that the song is a complete bop, with thundering orchestral work and Donny Osmond's spirited voice building everything up.

> The 20GayTeen rate is probably my favorite moment in Popheads history. After YEARS of watching Y&Y get slept and shat on across the subreddit and server, they finally got the justice they deserved in a giant curbstomp where no other song came close to winning at any point. Of course, they're not subreddit favorites or anything now, and I fully expect this to go out late day 1 or early day 2 [note from /u/letsallpoo: LOL] as an ""objective bop but not exactly a classic,"" but All For You's victory was still a personally immensely satisfying moment for me. - /u/TragicKingdom1

---

Fun fact: When I search for ""All For You"" on YouTube, I need to scroll to the second page to see this video! All drags aside, this is a solid and satisyingly gay pop song from a solid and satisfyingly gay pop group that has only improved in quality since their debut. ""All For You"" is explosive and upbeat like their best songs, and Olly's voice is as strong as ever as he calls out to his recalcitrant lover. It's a prime farewell song to any asshole, letting you dance your way through your rage and heartbreak.

> I knew that there was a strong possibility that Pompeii would win, but I'm glad it didn't have a clear cut path. With day 3 of this rate consisting of  80% ties, the competition was fierce COVID became classified as a global pandemic in the middle of this rate and I think the way this song has a certain feeling of uncertainty and question was very fitting as we all found ourselves in new places due to lockdown.“How am I gonna be an optimist about this” was a very fitting mood, and i’d say that pompeii was a very fitting winner. - /u/Roxieloxie

I used to dislike this song in high school, but after observing how the world can come crashing down pretty easily when in the face of a disaster this year, I do find this a teensy bit more relatable than I would like! Bastille was onto something; sometimes you really do just have to close your eyes to keep yourself from spiraling out of control. I still don't find myself particularly in love with this song; the omnipresence of ""Happier"" over the past few years made me a little less keen on Dan Smith's voice, and the ""eh-oh"" hook now just reminds me of [those USAA commercials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O338MdsOtJk). But I won't begrudge Bastille for making it here and for doing pretty decently, as they arguably have the most timely song for this year in this rate.

Even though my personal 11 (Catallena) was unjustly robbed, it's hard to disagree with Genie having won the rate - it's an undeniable classic by one of, if not the most iconic group that k-pop has ever birthed.

The Hallyu Wave refers to the spread of South Korean pop culture worldwide, which is a steady force that's been happening since the 90s. There's been multiple waves, and in the late 2000s, Girls' Generation emerged as one of the prominent forces propelling Korean entertainment to a global audience. Much of this came off the back of ""Gee,"" which led to a string of other irresistable tunes that endeared them to pop listeners around the world. It's hard to overstate how SNSD were genuine trailblazers — they were at the front of the pack before BTS, Blacpink, ""Gangnam Style,"" and all those other forces that made kpop just pop.

""Genie"" is not the aforementioned ""Gee,"" or their biggest and perhaps most infectious song, nor is it [their most innovative song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq7ftOZBy0E), nor is it their most recent [pop smash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4w8IbQTJpY). But it's remained perhaps their most beloved song and one of tthe best aged songs from that generation of kpop. It's featherlight yet thunderous, marching towards you with a cutesy energy that demands for you to be enchanted. I can't think of any better representation of the Hallyu wave than the image of SNSD stomping towards you, dressed in military uniforms, to deliver a simple, grammatically confused line: I'm genie for you boy! It's coquettish and threatening, turning you on but also impressing you with its power. DJ, put it back on!

> The early 2010s are, as I'm sure we've all heard a million times, a time period that a lot of this subreddit looks upon incredibly fondly, and that can definitely be credited to the loud and anthemic electronic dance production that backed a lot of the hits of that time period. The zeitgeist of EDM on the charts saw its peak around 2013, and it's within this year we can find Clarity, the winner of the EDM/Pop Girl Collaborations rate. While hosting this rate that included songs from 2009-2018, I was very much rooting for this to win out over Rather Be or any of the other more recent, more cleanly-produced songs due to it being one of the quintessential EDM classics from one of the biggest producers from that scene. With both longing vocals from Foxes but most importantly anthemic production from Zedd coating the track in a nostalgic melodrama, it provides a perfect summation of this era in pop music and why so many people look back at it in rose-tinted vision. - /u/hikkaru

Maybe if I were like most other Bay Area gaysians and went to raves I would have a deeper connection with this song, but as it stands it was more of an annoying pop radio hit from middle school that has aged ever so slightly better with time. Foxes puts on an amazing vocal performance, and Zedd's EDM beat that's free of ticking noises sounds quite fresh now that we know just how derivative he can be (when he's ripping off of Hilary Duff's husband Matthew Koma). This was the first sign of the EDM takeover in the world of pop music, a shift in sound that's still ongoing, and even though I would've preferred ""Rather Be"" to be here instead (although I'm glad it lost to ""Touch"" because lol why was that song even in that rate), I can't deny its impact and how it manages to capture the grandiose allure of EDM."

**1998tweety** (10): main pop girlies

**bbfan132** (10): excellence but will be robbed

**bluehxrizon** (10): what rate did this win wtf

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): the power that that has

**CrimsonROSET** (10): I feel bad betraying the M11 Channel Theme squad, but I think it'll get enough representation.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): I took a break from listening to the Spotify playlist just to listen to the provided YouTube link. Girl, why is it the 10-hour version? 💀Anyways, I am giving this an ironic 10 but we all know the Wii Shop Channel music is superior.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): This is an unironic ten. I’ve always absolutely adored the aesthetic of the Wii/Mii era, the imagery of all of these polygonal people and places just rising out of the sterile white void fascinates me in a way I can’t really explain, I had several of the generic Wii games like Wii Sports Resort or Wii Play and I would spend hours poking around in them intentionally ignoring the gameplay and exploring as much of the edges of these worlds as I could, hoping to uncover some kind of secret I never did find. The unique “elevator music for the entire universe” sound of the Mii theme is a huge part of this appeal, despite being glorified muzak it’s instantly distinctive (like, can you think of any actual music that really sounds like this?) and memorable and it sets the tone perfectly. I’m so pleased it’s gotten a second life as a piece of meme music so it can live beyond the now tragically discontinued Wii.

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (10): listen I know we said M11 and I swear I was going to but then I saw D1sco T1ts and all bets were off. The mii theme has had it's time, it's the darling of drama channels on youtube and we all know it by heart. It's time for someone else to take the crown

**ignitethephoenix** (10): the greatest rate winner of all time

**J\_Toe** (10): not on spotify but still an icon. Love the Wii Sports version of Hotline Bling

**kirby31200** (10): Unironically amazing soundtrack

**ManofOranges** (10): Watching this win the meme rate was so gratifying to me, especially since I had switched my 11 to this song like not too long before the reveal had started. Truly one of the most correct rate winners we've ever had. I'd love to see this win again, although this sub hates fun so I'm hesitant to think that it's gonna happen.

**Mudkip1** (10): pop perfection

**mysario** (10): I'm sorry for not being part of the M11 Channel gang

**nootnoot781** (10): which rate did this win? oh this rate

**raicicle** (10): honestly completely unironically a 10 for the cultural impact and how quirky a tune it is

**ReallyCreative** (10): unironically hope this wins

**skargardin** (10): An 11 contender, period!!

**steelstepladder** (10): Barely missed my 11

**Stryxen** (10): bum🤔 ba 😒bum 🤤bum🥴 ba 😝 bap 🙄 bap 😏 bap 😐 BAP 🥰 BAP 😶 BAP🤭

**Ionlywanttheworld** (9.9): iconic but Nintendo doesn't use it anymore

**InternetDude19** (9.5): Iconic. One of the most memorable and satisfying melodies in modern music.

**jasannn** (9): I have traveled back into time to 2007.

**sandyfishnets** (9): The Sims theme is better

**waluigiest** (9): honestly it’s just a good samba, love it

**WeastofEden44** (9): This is better than any of the production SOPHIE has ever done

**camerinian** (8): Wii Shop Channel literally outsold, maybe if the Mii Channel had microtransactions it wouldn’t have flopped #periodt

**static\_int\_husp** (7): the fact that i'm giving this a better score than some other winners really says a lot

**bulforster** (5): (#28) This song's placement is what I'm most excited for in the whole reveal.

**twat\_brained** (10): this is just Don't Take the Money but perfect

**sarcasticsobs** (9.5): yeah i’m a sucker for punchy synth-pop and an artist would have to try and make me disklike it, sue me

**seanderlust** (9.5): i had actually never heard this song before but I quite like it!

**RandomHypnotica** (9): Hanne > Sigrid

**steelstepladder** (9): One of the few songs I've never heard before this and it's kinda great?

**slimboyfriend** (8.6): if literally everything about this song were better it would be supercut by Lorde

**CrimsonROSET** (8.5): This honestly might grow on me between submitting and the rate reveal. We'll see.

**hikkaru** (8.5): didn't do worldvision bc i'm a flop but this is really good and i love her voice wow

**starlitsuns** (8.5): What rate was this in? Seriously, the production is beautiful and Hanne’s voice is beautiful here.

**Ionlywanttheworld** (8): hadn't heard this one before but it's good!

**mysario** (8): thank you Norway for your service

**nooodisaster** (8): Builds and builds... most pleasing.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): mom: we have Sigrid at home... Sigrid at home:

**vayyiqra** (8): It's by a Scandinavian synthpop girl so I have to like it now

**pat-rickstar** (7.8): Who will win the battle of the Norwegian pop girl songs titled Strangers? If you're reading this, you will know the answer

**1998tweety** (7.5): this bops

**akanewasright** (7.5): This is a really cute song

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): I was like “what rate did this win” and so I looked it up and it was Worldvision and I was a participant in that. Oops. So of the songs we rated I do NOT remember this one but it isn’t bad! It’s got a nice build to it and it really justifies its run time, though I do wish it got the point a little faster.

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): this sounds very Robyn, but thats a good thing!

**Stryxen** (7.5): its so cute

**suhonyu** (7.5): she's cute, give me melanie teas which I don't rly like but ya know whatever

**yatcho** (7.5): Who is this and why are there two songs named Strangers in this rate and why are they both the same formula but also why are they both bops?

**jackisboredtoday** (7.1): I’d never heard of Hanne at all before I started this rate, but this song is pretty solid. I’ll have to keep her in mind in the future

**bigbigbee** (7): Very sweet but a little boring. Definitely the weaker of the two songs called Strangers, IMO.

# Sigrid outsold

**ignitethephoenix** (7): can’t believe there’s 2 songs called strangers by Norwegian artists in this rate. Unfortunately this is the less superior one, but it’s cute

**worlds-okayest666** (7): this is fun but also feels like it could be sung by anyone. the other strangers in this rate outsold

**bbfan132** (6.5): cute but kind of underwhelming

**aresthormars** (6): A good bop. But it seems like I have heard far better synthpop song and somehow the repetitiveness of the chorus became dragging. Plus I kinda hear Now That I Found You in the structure of the melody of the chorus. The prechorus tho is chef kisses!

**AtomicViolet** (6): Nice but kinda bland tbh

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): Not a big fan, but I can see how this won Worldvision. It's also a lot better than most ESC entries too.

**fishingfor8** (6): sounds like a more nostalgic Carly song. Doesn't have the same charm though

**Frelock\_** (6): Also serviceable but with an interesting commentary

**kirby31200** (6): Definitely the worse of the two Strangers. Not bad but I don't think it stands out enough to be great

**ktajlili** (6): Decent writing, but I find the instrumentals a bit basic, and the vocals to be not my style

**PuggleMaster** (6): I was expecting something amazing in this song since it won a rate, but it was pretty one note and boring all the way through.

**racloves** (6): Sigrid outsold

**ReallyCreative** (6): normally I'm down for lowkey bedroom synthpop queens but this is just not that interesting

**SmileAndTears** (6): This is like the most generic synthpop-song-sung-by-a-white-girl I've ever heard

**waluigiest** (6): is it wrong that I kind of hear Melanie Martinez??

**camerinian** (5.5): this is a cute bop, shame about the bananies and avocadies voice once again ruining things

**raicicle** (5): it’s pleasant but its a shame how actually forgettable it is, her anonymously mellow voice definitely doesn’t help

**bulforster** (4.2): (#32) Cute song but in this rate cute doesn't really cut it.

**joshually** (4): I’M SO SORRY!! But that was really boring

**ManofOranges** (4): I mean, this song sounds perfectly fine as in it's not offensive to my ear in any way but that's about all I think it has going for it. I feel like it could you at least any kind of dynamic contrast but it really just doesn't go anywhere

**selegend** (4): pretty generic

**anothertown** (3): I mean… it’s no Sigrid. Also, it’s great to see the R-slur right there at the top when I google this hoe because it’s the title of one of her Instagram highlights

**moonagenightmares** (3): this is like the very definition of a basic pop song

**plvstvcbvrds** (3): i hate this banana avocado way of singing

**skargardin** (3): pretty run of the mill scandipop

**cloudbustingmp3** (2.7): one day popheads will stop overrating h&m'd synthpop songs with this title

**bbfan132** (10): the last minute is wild and i love every second of it

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this is gonna be cut sooner than it deserves

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): I really should listen to Tapestry.

**fadedblue09** (10): Damn, a timeless, uplifting bop. Also, I feel obligated to give this a 10 since she basically paved the way for my faves lol.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Gave this my eleven when we rated it the first time around and while it won’t be getting it this time, I think it was a worthy recipient; the cherry on top of one of the best albums ever recorded. I love the way the piano almost sounds likes an earthquake, as if the music is conjuring up the feeling of the earth shaking beneath her feet.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): In 2015 the song was featured in a mashup with Alanis Morissette's ""Hand In My Pocket"" on American television series Glee, ""Jagged Little Tapestry"", covered by Naya Rivera and Heather Morris.

**J\_Toe** (10): I'm glad we have another opportunity to rank and talk about Carole king, though a wish Joni Mitchell was part of this rate too!

**sarcasticsobs** (10): absolute banger

**Stryxen** (10): groundbreaking... earthmoving even

**waluigiest** (10): stunning intro to one of the best albums ever

**seanderlust** (9.7): something about this song is just such a winner for me. the driving energy, the sweet lyrics, the piano and guitar interplay....carole king more like carole queen.

**team\_kockroach** (9.5): Did anyone else notice that Fiona Apple ripped this off to make “Criminal”?

**bulforster** (9): (#8) I was confused how this won a rate when I first heard it but it's a huge grower, helps that Carole King is one of the best songwriters ever.

**cremeebrulee** (9): this is genuinely a bop but youngheads will slaughter this

**CrimsonROSET** (9): Everytime I put one of these on YouTube, I got scared when a Glee! cover hopped on. This one was fine! But I still got scared!

**lIIustration** (9): I was moved

**quinnpsych** (9): This song is underrated and punchy as hell. Still remember Mary Gilbeaux's audition of this song from American Idol though which is triggering.

**WeastofEden44** (8.9): Me getting topped within an ich of my life by the hot guy I talk to from time to time:

**ReallyCreative** (8.6): it's a great song that holds up fairly well against the heavy hitters of the rate, unfortunately it will probably leave quickly

**akanewasright** (8.5): It’s Too Late should have won this rate, but this is still a wonderful song from a perfect album.

**cocosairdep** (8.5): I never heard this one before, but I loved it. I really need to check out Tapestry.

**kappyko** (8.5): with all due respect to oldies there were like 5 better songs in its rate alone but when she gets going near the end its like the entire studio lights on fire

**welcometoNY** (8.5): the vocal production leaves a lot to be desired. i know it's probably done intentionally, but it's still bad.

**1998tweety** (8): she's cute

**anothertown** (8): I have too much goodwill toward this woman for writing like 4 of the precious few songs I will love for my entire life to not score this highly

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): I feel like I have been looking for this chorus for my entire life, and it's actually from CAROLE KING HERSELF? Wow we stan.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): classic but just not a favorite of mine here

**mysario** (8): classic rock queen

**ryokann** (8): mary guilbeaux

**steelstepladder** (8): This is day one bound ain't it

**TiltControls** (8): I like Carole King, but I never got the hype behind this song over her others

**zadooi** (8): I was wondering where I had heard this song before and of course it was Glee.

**Ionlywanttheworld** (7.5): she has better songs

**nooodisaster** (7.5): Snapage.

**aresthormars** (7): Great lyrics! ""When I see your face mellow as the month of May oh darling I can't stand it"" Chef kisses!

**Roxieloxie** (7): is may really a mellow month?

**runaway3212** (7): Carole King honestly never clicked for me.

**SmileAndTears** (7): Not a big fan of this tbh. Reminds me a bit of Fiona Apple and I didn't like her last album

**succulentils** (7): First time hearing this song since Kimberly Caldwell sang it on American Idol

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): white people really just do be dancing to this

**Tolk1en** (7): a bit repetitive but still a quite entertaining song

**RandomHypnotica** (5.7): I do like this song, but in a rate like this, it's just doesn't stand up as well

**moonagenightmares** (5.2): this sounds like its from the 50s and it would’ve been boring even then

**Frelock\_** (5): A Classic but not something I actively seek out to listen to

**ManofOranges** (5): Sorry to Carole King and any of the older folks who stan this song, I'm sure it could bring the house down in 1971, but I'm thoroughly whelmed with this song. The Earth is not really moving under my feet, maybe a few pebbles or something

**CarlieScion** (4): she sounds like she hasnt cleared her throat in 10 years

**joshually** (4): I don’t deny she is a great songwriter… but… her vocals leave me wanting more.. or autotune

**vayyiqra** (4): I wish I liked this more than I do

**PuggleMaster** (3): I'm sorry but I really didn't like this song or how dated it sounded (It was so muffled which comes with the age of the song :l)

4742,2020-11-27 20:27:01,k27cgq,"# Mixers

**anothertown** (10): This song is full of tropes from the era it was made in, but it perfects them all

**aresthormars** (10): This is my fave from the first time I have heard from this rate! It all started like a song that I kinda expected from a girl group. But the reggaeton influence in the beat for just the chorus, oh my Lord, what a vibe!

**bespectacIed** (10): in my head this is a smash that went number 1 in 189 countries and sold 400 million units

**camerinian** (10): holy fuck this was so close to my 11. This is as perfectly crafted as modern pop comes. The way the song builds itself up only to collapse into those harmonies on the chorus is something sent from the heavens. I hope this song stays relevant the same way that Wannabe has, because it's basically the pinnacle of girl group music

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): This is Little Mix's best song FOR A REASON.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Oh gosh, I feel like I keep saying “this is one of the first pop songs I really fell in love with” in this rate but it’s true, this is such a walk down memory lane. This is one of my few winning elevens so I went back and dug up my initial thoughts on it and here’s my favorite part: “When this song starts it’s like Leigh-Anne is slamming the door open and grabbing you by the throat and then the girls just take turns throwing you around the room, and you love every second of it. The lyrics are sexy and fun, the energy is overflowing, and that legendary chorus over that speaker pounding bass is just *it*.”

**ImADudeDuh** (10): 10uch

**PuggleMaster** (10): Throwback to me having to stan this song in secret, because I was a stan of that messy group that was lead by a rat.

**Roxieloxie** (10): I Never got as into Little Mix as I did 1D, but I do have massive respect for them. This is one of my favorite songs from them and if you dont like it, you simply hate fun

**runaway3212** (10): This is my favourite little mix song

**TheQueenOfVultures** (10): The Girl Group We Deserve

**twat\_brained** (10): wait wouldn't it be hilarious if this scored directly above Clarity since both songs only *just* beat ""Rather Be"" to the win?

**CarlieScion** (9): sounds so smooth and good

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): Stream this instead of Confetti.

**Ionlywanttheworld** (9): the only LM song I know tbh

**worlds-okayest666** (9): love this song but also think they have better singles tbh

**bigbigbee** (8): This grew on me. I thought it was very “tropical house 101” but the riffs in the final chorus sound great and their vocals are all super clean. The lyrics though…eh.

**joshually** (8): this is not my favorite LM song, but these girls deserve better

**ManofOranges** (8): Rather be I'm so sorry, I'm sorry that a song like this would steal your spot. At least this song is pretty good though.

**nooodisaster** (8): I have this theory Perrie secretly hates this song. On ""Little Mix Plays Truth Or Wine"", Perrie refused to reveal a song she hated, but when asked if it had to do with the word ""sunny"", did reluctantly say yes. What is ""Sunny""? Well, a Google search reveals ""Sunny Productions"", the writer for one Little Mix song: Touch. Perrie also stated she didn't want to say what song it was because it was a collaboration. ""But Touch wasn't a collaboration!"" you cry. Except there WAS: Touch feat. Kid Ink. Is Perrie reusing to admit she hates a fan favorite song due to fear of backlash? That dear reader, is for you to decide...

**starlitsuns** (8): This song is such a vibe! Also this makes me miss that phase in pop music where tropical house was all over the place, so that’s fun, I guess?

**succulentils** (8): I'm very into this music video. The song itself is... fine. Kinda how I feel about most of their songs.

**vayyiqra** (8): Aggressively 2016 and it's good

**WillamThunderfuck** (8): It's a really cute bop!

**Stryxen** (7.6): little mix is my guilty pleasure and I do not feel guilty

**bbfan132** (7.5): cute but holiday and break up song are excellent, stream them

**CrimsonROSET** (7.5): I swear I had to remind myself 4 times that no, Alessia Cara does NOT have credited vocals in this song.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): it’s fine but it just seems very generic to me

**jackisboredtoday** (7.4): their best song yep yep

**hunnybee12** (7): what it god's name is perrie wearing in this music video

**selegend** (7): the video is hilariously bad

# ma'am that was in the first winners rate

**suhonyu** (7): this shoulda been black magic :/

#Harmonizers

**moonagenightmares** (6.8): kinda basic but the chorus is catchy asf

**ReallyCreative** (6.8): pretty good but there's way too much in this rate that blows this out of the water

**SmileAndTears** (6.8): The chorus just doesn't work at all

**WeastofEden44** (6.8): Power deserved u rats

**kirby31200** (6.5): Listening to this I definitely thought it was older than 2017. It's fun but it's a little basic

**steelstepladder** (6.5): Daft Punk deserved

**bulforster** (6.2): (#22) Love these girls, it has some kinda basic lyrics but this song is great.

**intheaftermath** (6.2): I feel like I've seen 200 bad anime amvs to this song

**aestheticen** (6): I played it too much back then

**waluigiest** (6): the chorus is wet but the rest is pretty nondescript

**welcometoNY** (6): this song finds little mix masquerading as pop virtuosos. i know a lot of people love this song, and it's easy to see why, but i can't help but feel that it's just a tired replica of something that's been done better a thousand times before.

**jsonphile** (5.5): I know very little about Little Mix. As in I know nothing except they’re a girl group. Since this won a rate I presume that means it’s one of their best songs, and it’s just....fine. I don’t know maybe I’m missing something but they just seem pretty generic. Not bad, but nothing particularly interesting.

**RandomHypnotica** (5.5): If you told me this was a mashup of some MØ, Zara Larsson and Sigrid songs I would believe you

**hikkaru** (5): how did this beat rather be

**MoonlightByWindow** (5): well it’s there i guess

**seanderlust** (5): three songs later, I don't remember what this sounds like.

**skargardin** (5): among the other songs here this is just ok

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): this song sounds like a Sephora commercial

**cocosairdep** (4): It’s fun I guess but a bit generic imo.

**fadedblue09** (4): Really forgettable I'm sorry.

**Frelock\_** (4): Music and melody seem uninspired

**ktajlili** (4): I think it's annoying. What else can i say?

**lIIustration** (4): this goes nowhere

**zadooi** (4): I've said it many times, but Little Mix makes Disney Channel sounding music.

**kappyko** (3): dont mistake me for a hater because little mix come up with some of the best in mainstream pop and i gave them my 11 in a different rate but this is ass complete doo doo ca ca shit diarrhea

**plvstvcbvrds** (3): they make music for instagram hair tutorials that i keep saying i'm not interested in. or music for pretty little thing youtube ads. or netflix teen movies for the obligatory party scene

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): i can think of 10 songs right off the bat that sound almost exactly like this and do it better

**cloudbustingmp3** (2.4): their only good song is Move :(

**chillbumps5** (2): this sounds like something a demi lovato fan would like

**wavingwolves** (2): imagine going from pop perfection get weird to one of the worst albums i've ever listened to

**plastichaxan** (1): LM are hit or miss for me and this is a huge miss oop

**team\_kockroach** (0): Everything about this screams “commercial sellout”."
4743,2020-11-27 21:23:51,k27cgq,It's gonna be Top 3 at least.

4745,2020-11-28 20:08:54,k27cgq,i respect the shit out of you for the BRAVERY of giving a 11 to a kpop song in this rate. i did my best and gave both russian roulette and genie 10s
4746,2020-11-27 20:36:17,k27cgq,and the best song we've heard in this rate yet!

4748,2020-11-27 22:29:24,k27cgq,"# the handful of people who enjoy Jack Antonoff when he's not producing tracks for female pop stars

**aresthormars** (10): This is Jack Antonoff and Lorde greatness!

**cremeebrulee** (10): if this isn't day 3 i will be throwing hands

**CrimsonROSET** (10): There are songs in this rate that are going to be robbed. Maybe the artist isn't that good outside this song, maybe the genre is just out of the ordinary for the regular pophead, maybe it's just too lost to time. But I see absolutely no reason for this song to go out at least before halfway through, but I don't trust popheads to carry through.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): This is definitely Jack Antonoff at his fucking best. I always knew Lorde was on the back-up vocals, but I finally heard her voice clearly with this headphone from JBL that I am wearing.

**hikkaru** (10): most of bleachers i dislike but this... this HITS even tho i would have preferred hard times x

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rFJuHw8zQ0iBkcYQNr6FABPvW0Rm4RW2/view

**Ionlywanttheworld** (10): the best song on both their albums

**lIIustration** (10): Great vibe

**ManofOranges** (10): This song is immaculate in my eyes so long as I ignore the fact that it's inspired by Lena Dunham. That's this song's only shortcoming, honestly

**mysario** (10): I still remember this rate and I still can't believe this won

**nooodisaster** (10): This song will be massacred. But I hope popheads just remembers who produced their favs most critically acclaimed albums they just can't stop praising (Melodrama, folklore, Lover, NFR!, etc.). Put some RESPEK on the name.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): The best Bleachers song without a doubt, and frankly one of Jack's best songs all together

**ReallyCreative** (10): Gone Now has grown on me with time, and this song is actually just excellent! Release B3 Jack

**shhhneak** (10): Hearing this song live in a stadium would probably destroy me.

**skargardin** (10): but what a banger

**slimboyfriend** (10): it’s big and wistful and the only downside is that it’s probably about Lena Dunham

**starlitsuns** (10): another day 1 loss because men and especially Jack Antonoff but I love vibey indie rock songs like this okay

**steelstepladder** (10): Don't be rude to men pls

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): I miss being in a popheads when this song dropped before Jack Antonoff divided us all as a nation 😞

**TiltControls** (10): Some of the best production of Jack's career.

**welcometoNY** (10): one of my favourite songs of all time, absolutely perfect in every way

**Stryxen** (9.6): I liked this song before I even knew who jack antonoff was also can someone please tell me why some people here hate jack antonoff so much

**bigbigbee** (9.5): My other favorite new discovery of the rate. Lorde’s sweet, soft vocals in the first part of the final chorus takes this song from great to outstanding.

**kappyko** (9.5): U STEAL THE AIR OUT OF MY LUNGS ETC.

**WeastofEden44** (9.2): This is if Maggie Rogers was a hipster male from Brooklyn and exclusively drank espresso

**1998tweety** (9): Love this, Lorde is in it just the perfect amount.

**jsonphile** (9): never heard this song or anything by this band before but I guess Jack Antonoff is just a musical genius

**quinnpsych** (9): Perfect singalong summer song for me

**seanderlust** (9): today we learned that that vocal affect he does at the end of lines in the pre-chorus is very hard to do well. oof. anyways, great song.

**pat-rickstar** (8.5): This is probably going to get demolished but you know if Antonoff produced this for Taylor or Carly we would all eat it up

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): JACK THAT CHORUS COULD'VE BEEN WAY MORE EXPLOSIVE

**engifear** (8.2): Lorde's backing vocals at the end really make the song.

**kirby31200** (8): This is certainly a good song but I'm also kind of like ""yup that's a 2010s synthpop song alright""

**raicicle** (8): I’m not going to call this a classic compared to the rest of the songs in this rate but this is Bleachers’ best song

**suhonyu** (8): when in rome by the promise teas

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): will we fIGHT? stay up lATE? in my dREAMS i’m to bLAME different sIDES of the bED roll your eYES shake my hEAD

**vayyiqra** (8): Jackoff might not be a great singer but he is still my guy

**waluigiest** (8): why my girl Lorde on background vocals….

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.9): Jack Antonoff looks so punchable and I wish I could hate this but it’s actually pretty good. I get what Jack Antonoff means when he says he wants a female voice though, the whole time I was listening to this I was like “Betty Who would murder this track.”

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): it’s fine but not a standout here

**Roxieloxie** (7.3): hm this isnt ""I Wanna Get Better' but I guess it's alright

**twat\_brained** (7.3): I can't believe this is the closest we'll get to a new Lorde song I miss you Ella ffs please come back so I don't have to pretend L^n^ D^nh^m deserves love songs written about her

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.2): this was originally gonna be my 0 but it's grown on me somehow

**bbfan132** (7): parts of this are good but it’s soooooo overproduced which is funny since jack antonoff is known for being a great producer

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): first time hearing this song and it’s actually pretty good

**bulforster** (6.8): (#19) This song is so good but Jack is slightly too understated as a singer to fully sell it for me.

# insert Lena Dunham joke here

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): There's nothing that kills a song for me more than a weak chorus. The other parts of this song deserve better than this.

**Frelock\_** (6): Don't know this one but seems nice

**ktajlili** (6): IDK. This sounds super generic and not that unique. I like the intensity, but overall find it disappointing, especially after finding out that it's Jack Antonoff, the person behind Melodrama, Norman Fucking Rockwell!, and some of the best songs off of Lover

**selegend** (6): the chorus is good

**wavingwolves** (6): not even lorde singing in this will save it from being a bottom 5 song (i still like it though)

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (6): lowkey I’m still salty that this won over all the songs on after laughter

**sandyfishnets** (5): Jack Antonoff is super talented but this song is too in your face at times.

**runaway3212** (4): Jack Antonoff only works when he works with more talented musicians

**plastichaxan** (3.5): Production is great but this was… something… bad

**fadedblue09** (3): I really don’t care about After Laughter that much so I don’t mind it losing to this. That being said, this isn’t really good either.

**fxsparrow** (3): It's a good song but I don't think Jack's voice does it justice. Should've let Lorde sing the whole thing.

**joshually** (3): I wasn’t feelin it….

**anothertown** (2): this sucks giant ass

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (2): I just find them really boring

**bespectacIed** (1): this is awful..."

**1998tweety** (10): rigga morris but I must admit this does deserve a 10

**aresthormars** (10): There is something enchanting from the production of this song. At the same time, great lyricism from Taylor!

**bbfan132** (10): i was enchanted to give this a 10

**CarlieScion** (10): 2 AM WHO DO U LOVE!!!!!

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): GOD POPHEADS PLEASE DON'T FUCKING PUT THIS BEAUTIFUL SONG ABOUT HAVING A CRUSH ON ADAM YOUNG OUT OF DAY 1. But for real, I kinda wish this isn't the only Taylor song in this rate. :( Don't worry, folklore is going to dominate the 2020 Main Pop Girls rate.

**hikkaru** (10): not to be a swiftie but yeah

**hunnybee12** (10): in middle school I loved this song so much I would write out the lyrics to this over and over again with different color markers in class

**InfernalSolstice** (10): third choice 11

**InternetDude19** (10): This is one of her best songs.

**intheaftermath** (10): Speak Now is such an incredible album, and was my first concert ever. I love this song beyond belief, I just know its rerecording will sound even better

**kirby31200** (10): I really did not expect to love this as much as I do. I love the passion and intensity. Good reminder that I still need to listen to folklore.

**lIIustration** (10): surprised this is the Taylor song here but she just sounds so good

**ManofOranges** (10): I find it funny that the only Taylor song to ever win a rate is one from a more country-oriented album of hers, and it won because of the very last ballot. In such a seemingly swiftian sub, Taylor definitely doesn't have a lot of favoritism when it comes to rates. Anyways, I know this song isn't gonna do well.

**pat-rickstar** (10): I can see why this is a fan favourite Taylor song

**runaway3212** (10): It pains me to not give this an 11, but for what it is worth this song isn't even the best on speak now and in any other rate if this was her only song I would've given this an 11.

**welcometoNY** (10): it pains me not to be giving Taylor my 11, but when the song in question is so middle-of-the-road in terms of her discography, i have no choice. i still think it's a brilliant song but she literally has a hundred better ones. i guess there's no accounting for (popheads') taste.

**camerinian** (9.5): fuck maybe i do need to listen to the rest of those fan favourite Taylor singles, I had no expectations for this but wow

**fadedblue09** (9.5): Tbh, I still don’t get why Swifties unanimously consider this to be the best song on Speak Now, but I do like it a fair bit, so...it's good, I guess? (curious to see where this will place tho).

**wanderingimpromptu3** (9.5): Any song that's 6 minutes and is still enjoyable by the end is an accomplishment

**twat\_brained** (9.4): the first time I heard this was when I heard it mashed up with Wildest Dreams. I hardly remembered hearing this because I was just on my toes the whole concert waiting to hear Wildest Dreams. I now regret sleeping on this song; it's quite beautiful. Wait, I just realized, is the ""this is me trying"" lyric what Taylor alludes to on Folklore? Damn, she's clever.

**chillbumps5** (9): i despise the instrumentals and production on this album but this song is undeniably good

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): Last Kiss is better than this, but it's incredible nonetheless.

**Ionlywanttheworld** (9): this song is a journey

**SmileAndTears** (9): Bop

**TragicKingdom1** (9): if any taylor song had to be a rate winner im glad its this one tbh

**worlds-okayest666** (9): still baffles me that this is about the owl city guy

**jsonphile** (8.5): Back to December is the best song from Speak Now, but this is a close second I guess

**nooodisaster** (8): Not this being the only song on Speak Now to feature a co-writer so I can't drop my ""Taylor Swift, at 19, wrote a self-written album, at 19 years of age, at only 19, written just by her"" fact. A losing today :(

**Roxieloxie** (8): I am not a taylor swift fans by any means, however,, I ran an Owl City/Adam Young tumblr in 2013(hoot owls sound off) so I am very well aware of this song. The high score isnt really for the song itself but more so for Adams response and how beautiful it was

**sarcasticsobs** (8): never heard this (not sarcastic). miles better country than than bro-pop country (not sarcastic). this taylor swift might be good! (sarcastic)

**seanderlust** (8): that ""please don't be in love with someone else"" part is super cute. think what you want to think about t swift, but when she's on her lyrical A game, it's unmatched.

**skargardin** (8): cute

**waluigiest** (8): I have to admit I was surprised when this won. It’s good and it’s cute, but I don’t think it’s close to the best of the rate, or even the best on Speak Now. The chorus does really slap tho

**Stryxen** (7.9): this song shouldn’t be as likeable as it is

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): i can't believe out of all the Taylor songs that almost one, this is the only one that actually did it

**suhonyu** (7.5): disney channel teas, i woulda picked any other song from this album tbh

**CrimsonROSET** (7): I'm surprised Taylor doesn't do longer songs often. She's a good fit for them.

**Frelock\_** (7): The music doesn't do anything crazy interesting, but the lyrics are pretty inspiring.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): this song is fine but it drags so much more than it should.

**joshually** (7): a cute song

**PuggleMaster** (7): I'd probably enjoy this more if I could listen to it a few more times.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): all rise for the white girl anthem

**vayyiqra** (7): :pensivetaylor:

**wavingwolves** (7): soundtrack of my teenage relationships

# please do not send these people death threats

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6.9): https://i.imgur.com/NWWFoDb.png

**cloudbustingmp3** (6.8): the 1989 version is better because it goes into a better song

**team\_kockroach** (6.5): I can’t help but think many of Taylor’s “intimate, folksy ballads” pre-Red have been completely outshadowed by the ballads on Red, Folklore, and even Lover to an extent. Enchanted is a perfect example of this - the sentiment is there, but her quivering low vocals and sparse instrumentals aren’t good enough to carry the rest of the song.

**TiltControls** (6.5): There was better on the album

**raicicle** (6): owl city won

**bulforster** (5.4): (#26) I really like this but it is quite overblown.

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): This is possibly the rate winner I have the most negative feelings towards, there were SO MANY good songs in this rate that would have made for amazing winners and y’all selected… this? I can’t bring myself to hate it as a song because it is decently cute but like all of the songs on this album it’s just too damn long and not consistently interesting.

**J\_Toe** (5): was not expecting this to be the Taylor song in the rate, she really does get relegated to #2 on these rates, huh?

**kappyko** (5): cannot fucking believe this is about owl city

**plvstvcbvrds** (5): if i had to choose a taylor swift song i actually liked, this song would be up there as far as songs that i don't hate. i'm not trying to get doxxed swifties, don't come for me.

**ReallyCreative** (5): I think the most obnoxious thing about Swifties, besides maybe the doxxing, is their insatiable desire to choose Taylor's most mediocre songs and be so damn loud about them.

**steelstepladder** (5): Taylor has better

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): i mean it sure is a 6 minute long taylor swift song

**fishingfor8** (3): I still have a knee jerk hate for any Taylor before Red

**mysario** (3): I forgot to do this rate until it was too late but spoilers - ""Blown Away"" would have won if I submitted

**anothertown** (2): this was one of 5-6 songs that played at the movie theater where I worked in my hometown.. it was over before it began miss sift

**plastichaxan** (2): why is this so boring and it just kept going:sob: she has way better songs

**zadooi** (2): This song has no business being more than three minutes long.

**selegend** (1): snooze

**bespectacIed** (0): Gag. Literally, not the gay lingo. This song is so gross :( I always scoff at fans who oversell T's songwriting skills (btw she writes super well 60% of the time, i give her that) when that very fanbase thinks one of her best songs is this ... this 6th grade diary entry

**ManofOranges** (8): While it's maybe not the most stunning song ever, I'm still glad it won its rate over that Zayn song or Sign of the times. However, I'm prepared to see this probably get like 5th to last place in this rate

**pat-rickstar** (8): Honestly didn't expect to like this as much as I do

**plvstvcbvrds** (8): he makes this slightly elevated white boy with a guitar music that always makes me want to go to a hollister or an american eagle and look at their jeans for a bit to feel like i'm in high school again.

**PuggleMaster** (8): I thought his entire album was just boring folk music, but this really surpassed my expectations.

**skargardin** (8): this bops a whole lot harder than I remember it doing!

**worlds-okayest666** (8): honestly better than i was expecting

**WeastofEden44** (7.7): Really cute, fun bop, but cute against gorgeous...

**camerinian** (7.5): this is a cute bop, but, like, winner? ehhhhhh

**SmileAndTears** (7.5): I honestly had no idea this was a Niall song. It's just so anonymous and the kind of song that'd play in a forever 21/american eagle

**TiltControls** (7.5): It's fine.

**WillamThunderfuck** (7.5): I've heard this song on the radio before but I never even realised this is by Niall???

**CarlieScion** (7): its okay. only angel deserved!!!!!

**Frelock\_** (7): Simple background beat makes this an easy toe tapper.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Niall winning the 1D solos rate was a pleasant surprise and I think he deserved it but when you stack this song against everything else here… Day 1? He’s just gotten hotter and hotter though (…musically… …of course…) and I hope we rate *Heartbreak Weather* at some point.

# the misandry

**Ionlywanttheworld** (7): not a fan of a lot of Niall's stuff tbh

**MelodramaticLemonade** (7): This song isn't bad but I'm baffled at how something this mediocre can win a rate

**ReallyCreative** (7): it's good but for some reason it's not super memorable? idk I've listened to it like 7 times, enjoyed it each time, but could not remember anything about it 20 minutes later. also WHAT is he saying like Ariana out-enunciated

**seanderlust** (7): this song feels just a little airtight for my tastes. overall it's a bop though

**starlitsuns** (7): This song has never done much for me, but it’s really nice seeing Niall make the Winners Rate :) I’m not the biggest fan of the route of indie-ish guitar pop that Niall took, so that’s probably contributing to this score.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): this sounds like a country cover of a mid-2010s chill dance song and this is a Good thing

**bbfan132** (6.5): i don’t know how this won a rate lol, it’s decent but it’s nothing special

**RandomHypnotica** (6.1): This is cute but it's not a real contender in this rate and everyone knows it

**cloudbustingmp3** (6): it's not great but its also not ass garbage so that makes it better than any other 1d solo song by default

**jasannn** (6): It would have been an 8+ if it was a more instrumental chorus and he wasn't annoyingly repeating ""She's going."" The album cover also haunts me.

**slimboyfriend** (6): I mean it’s better than I expected and given the competition I’m not surprised it won its first rate

**Stryxen** (6): I thought this was a Walk The Moon song

**vayyiqra** (6): I was ready to not like this based on not caring for 1D but this is ... alright

**moonagenightmares** (5.3): how in the world did this end up here

**joshually** (5): this song isn’t terrible. I mean it’s not great, but it’s not terrible

**anothertown** (4): Lost Made in the AM z-side

**kappyko** (4): girl lol

**nooodisaster** (4): I think we need to have the conversation that some rates just have a lower ceiling than others.

**steelstepladder** (4): lmao this is gonna get eaten alive

**sarcasticsobs** (3): listened to this 4 times and still barely remember it

**selegend** (3): alright lol

**useless-sheep** (3): what rate did this win.... how is niall even in this rate

**mysario** (2): this song had like the 2nd lowest score a winner has ever gotten which says volumes about the quality of the rate it came from I think

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): i am so tired of hearing this song every single day at work its not even that good.

**welcometoNY** (2): songs that talk about women this way are just gross to me. it's also just...very bad. seriously though, THIS won a rate?

**fadedblue09** (1.5): Bleh. Could pass off as some Ed Sheeran/Shawn Mendes filler I guess. Mad respect to all those who participated though (like, imagine wasting your time on Liam Payne's music lmao).

**shhhneak** (1): why is this here what did it win lmao

**waluigiest** (0): I was so pissed when this won. It’s such an uninteresting song who is gunning for this ever

# just the people who hate Harry Styles

**bespectacIed** (7): i prefer slow hands or like i would, but this bops. I'm just glad h***y lost this rate omg that man irks

**hikkaru** (6): anyways thank god harry isn't here

**bulforster** (1.2): (#47) While it is very funny that Harry Styles didn't win this rate, this song is pretty boring compared to the rest of its competition here.

# the person who's gonna fight them

**hunnybee12** (4): this was the first rate I ever submitted for but my scores got rejected because they were “too biased"" for harry .. but it was my truth sob"
4760,2020-11-28 01:47:33,k27cgq,">You might be surprised to learn that it was, of all the things that came out that year, Niall's country-ish work, Flicker. There's a number of reasonable excuses for this — there's always been a lot of Directioners here, and his album wasn't omega popular enough to be seen as highly sought, so people thought they had a good chance of getting his writeup. 

oh my god?? thats so interesting"
4761,2020-11-27 20:37:27,k27cgq,"> To all the people who complained about this song being too long: I PUT THE RADIO EDIT IN THE PLAYLISTS FOR A REASON!!! DID YOU GO OUT OF YOUR WAY TO LISTEN TO THE WHOLE-ASS THING JUST TO BE ABLE TO DRAG IT??? I hate how overwrought the original ""Mirrors"" track is, as well as almost every other song from its parent album, so there's a reason I tried to help both y'all and this song by linking the edit. Why did y'all torture yourselves with the entire thing? Did you watch the music video or something? I know it won video of the year or some shit, but that doesn't mean it's worth eight minutes of your time!

Poo snapped here. I actually like how long the song is, but I have so many other songs to go through for the rate so the radio edit was much needed."
4762,2020-11-27 20:34:37,k27cgq,"# Men's Rights!

**akanewasright** (10): This is like the only Timberlake song I like. And I REALLY like it. All ten minutes of it. I honestly think this song is little a masterpiece and one of the best pop hits of the last decade. I keep trying to find reasons to lower its score, and I can’t.

**aresthormars** (10): I love this song and the part two of it. This is peak JT.

**bbfan132** (10): that chorus is excellent, i feel every word he is singing even if the song is cheesy as hell. i prefer the longer version but this is also a 10

**cremeebrulee** (10): will also be robbed

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): The 20/20 Experience era was the peak of my JT stanning and this is definitely still one of my top favorite songs from him. I hate that this is probably going to go out on Day 1 because the music video holds a special place in my heart. The MV pretty much summarizes my parents' marriage, in the best and the worst way possible.

**frogaranaman** (10): do the mens rate

**hunnybee12** (10): this song is perfect I cant put into words why but it is

**ignitethephoenix** (10): truly his peak

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I just KNOW this is gonna be robbed cause y’all will complain about this being too long even though the playlist SPECIFICALLY USED THE RADIO EDIT

**ManofOranges** (10): Okay if I listened to the like 8 minute long version this song would lose a few points but the playlist has the radio edit instead so I'm perfectly content with giving that a 10

**quinnpsych** (10): Unreal song, literal cultural reset, defined my early 10's

**Roxieloxie** (10): Not to romanticize like fucking 6th grade or whatever grade I was in when this album dropped, but that tiktok that said life was better when this song was on the radio might've made some points

**runaway3212** (10): This track is so great I always forget it's a whole nine minutes

**suhonyu** (10): the only time this straight man deserved rights

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): do the mens rate

**InfernalSolstice** (9.5): cant wait for popheads to absolutely rob this because it's justin timberlake

**SmileAndTears** (9.5): BOP

**CrimsonROSET** (9.2): Bless whoever put the radio version over standard.

**astrologicalangel** (9): one of the rare cases where the radio edit is better

**intheaftermath** (9): Can't believe my middle school emo phased forced me to hate this song. I haven't hear it in years and it's actually so good

**starlitsuns** (9): What happened to this song? It was all over the radio in 2014 as part of JT’s comeback, and just disappeared. It definitely has aged well, and I just want to hear more of it.

**mysario** (8.8): rate the 8 minute version you cowards

**InternetDude19** (8.6): This is better than I remember

**1998tweety** (8.5): big bop but y'all will drag it cause it's a man and it's long

**sarcasticsobs** (8.5): offended at the inclusion of the radio edit vs. the original but whatever, still great

**plastichaxan** (8.2): maybe men deserve a little bit of respect

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.1): this is a bop

**fadedblue09** (8): I love this song more than I'd like to admit, even though I still think that The 20/20 Experience is an insanely overrated album.

**Ionlywanttheworld** (8): JT's best song since FSLS

**jasannn** (8): I'm surprised how well this song aged.

**Stryxen** (8): trying to form an opinion on a justin timberlake song give me a second

**twat\_brained** (8): great song but Treasure should've won

**camerinian** (7.5): host can you please drop my score by a point if i was meant to rate the full version instead of the radio edit thx

**nooodisaster** (7.5): It's fine but.... it's also by Justin Timberlake.

**Frelock\_** (7): Catchy tune

**raicicle** (7): i do think this is a great song but in retrospect i don’t actually think this is one of the songs that benefited from the two-part 8-minute treatment that songs on the 20/20 experience had so I’m taking marks off for that

**succulentils** (7): Mirrors don't stare back. Reflections stare back. I hate these lyrics.

**waluigiest** (7): its like ur my mirror...... WEY HO

# maybe not all men deserve rights tho

**slimboyfriend** (6.9): I used to love this song back in the day, but now I’m whelmed

**jackisboredtoday** (6.8): why did JT need to make every song on the 20/20 experience ten minutes… one or two i get but there’s so many self-indulgent long songs on that album

**lIIustration** (6.5): the beginning guitars aren’t my favorite

**worlds-okayest666** (6): honestly this is ok but it was so overplayed when it came out i cant help but hate it...like it was completely unavoidable it was such a nightmare!!

**ReallyCreative** (5.5): he has done this exact same song like 3 other times and each one is a lot better than this

**racloves** (5): can anyone even understand a word he’s saying in this song? I swear there’s a bit that says “my hand in a bucket full of soap(?)”

**bespectacIed** (4): i hate praising this awful human being, this is an ok song unfortunately

**CarlieScion** (4): men

**PuggleMaster** (4): I actually loved the first part of the 20/20 expierence but god did i always think this song was overrated.

**steelstepladder** (4): Huh... First time listening to this song in years and it's worse than I remember. Didn't need to be 8 minutes that's for sure.

**team\_kockroach** (4): The instrumental doesn’t fit the vocalist at all. The arena-rock guitar at the beginning just recedes and this weird guitar-clap takes its place. Meanwhile, Justin has no emotion or charisma in his voice.

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): Okay so now I finally have a name and a face to put to that song that I heard on the radio all the time as a kid that I hated. Cool. This is one of those songs where I think I’d like it if it were sung by, like, Leona Lewis or someone, but I just don’t think that Justin has the voice to pull this off. He sounds whiny and the tinny production doesn’t help, plus this does not need to be anywhere near as long as it is.

**joshually** (3): I cannot stand his voice… it’s just so punchable

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): i am not fucking listening to an 8 minute long justin timberlake song

**anothertown** (2): Finding out that this song is pop stans’ favorite off the 20/20 Experience now of days was like a slap in the face. There are some fun and interesting things going on on that album and absolutely none of them are here.

**bulforster** (1.8): (#44) This beat feels clunky somehow and really makes the song drag given it's on the longer side.

**ElizabethDDoS** (1): No. Stream Unbreakable.

**urlocalcracchead** (1): because of what he did to my girl janet jackson

**wavingwolves** (1): i'm already dreading the way i'll have to listen to this again at the reveal

**AtomicViolet** (0): This had me in the first half not gonna lie, than it just kept going, and the longer it went the more I turned on it until finally I was completly sick of it. If you're gonna go over 8 minutes at least have the decency to be a Purple Rain or November Rain epic instead of this

**cloudbustingmp3** (0): this gets a 0 for being god awful and also bc my ex loved this song so it's double tainted now

**hikkaru** (0): when this won over both bruno bops in its rate... ladies i was BOILING... i've always found this song really annoying especially as something that got a lot of overplay on the radio and the non-radio edit (and the whole album tbqh) has no business being eight minutes long

**plvstvcbvrds** (0): i fucking hate this song. i think he made a deal with the devil to make this song play everywhere the year it came out, which happened to be a year i was working retail, and i heard this song 15 times a day for a year. an entire year. i once wore ear plugs to work because of this damn song. i would stand still too long and start humming it to myself. it's the glitter of music. the herpes of music. i will never be rid of this godforsaken attempt at art.

**seanderlust** (0): I want to be absolutely clear that I am not just rating this so low because men bad, but that certainly doesn't help. it's just...it's just boring, i'm sorry. the entire time this was playing I was just waiting to hear kate bush.

**anothertown** (10): The best verse I’ve ever heard in a pop song is: “Irregardless of what transpired / It ain't even worthy of a slick reply / Even if I was the last woman alive / I would be like Ginger, you ain't Gilligan, I / really don't care, I'm in love with the island / Rockin Dior cause it goes with my diamonds / Got a pink gown custom by Alaia / I'll be on stage when the stadium light up”

**bbfan132** (10): mariah is a lyrical genius

**bespectacIed** (10): Didn't do this rate but even I was shocked this won over Honey (i was rooting for Honey lol). This song and the rest of caution are a classic tho

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): should've been her 19th #1 before Godmas

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): R&B Mariah over ballad Mariah any day. I should give Caution a listen for real.

**fadedblue09** (10): The best Mariah song on this list, yet for some reason it will probably be the first one to go out.

**J\_Toe** (10): Love the Lil Kim sample

**ManofOranges** (10): This song is a Yes Yes

**PuggleMaster** (10): Mariah literally proved that she still fucking had it when she released Caution. I'm tempted to dock her a few points for releasing that shitty remix so the Nicki Minaj haters would stream it.

**ReallyCreative** (10): this might be my favorite R+B song of the century not gonna lie, the absolute EQUALITY demonstrated in ""he's a slut, he's a hoe, he's a freak""

**runaway3212** (10): Caution is a godlike album and this is a godlike song

**twat\_brained** (10): What's Mariah's most hip-hop heavy album? I'll listen to it. Even if it's MC=^2 I'll play it on repeat.

**Roxieloxie** (9.8): its a bop

**1998tweety** (9): Honey deserved to win the rate but this is good too

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I love this song but I kinda ruined it for myself by listening to [the Shawni remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAl7ktjKviU) so much because now the song feels incomplete without her, kinda like Nicki Minaj on “Up Out My Face.” Still a good song but I know what it’s like when it sounds GREAT.

**moooo566** (9): I don't really know Mariah outside of AIWFCIY but this is actually good?

**mysario** (9): the closed loop of Mariah copying Ariana copying Mariah

**lIIustration** (8.5): love the production, the lyricism is weak

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): she’s still got it

**akanewasright** (8): Cute bop with a really well used sample

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): I like Caution, but there are a handful of tracks I would've preferred taking the win in its rate. (S P I R I T, it's great to see, we got it, the spirit, hey, hey, let's hear it).

**hikkaru** (8): rating this again instead of h*ney i LOVE it here!!!!! i feel like usually my overall opinions on albums/songs aren't too spicy compared to the general popheads userbase but i just can't get into robyn at all especially honey so i was ecstatic when this song pulled through in that rate. anyways the production of this song is so fun

**Ionlywanttheworld** (8): a strong single from Mariah!

**joshually** (8): honestly… this song is not her best but I’d still jam to it

**suhonyu** (8): it's cute, thanks forcing me to listen to it

**waluigiest** (8): overall a fine album and a fine song, but nothing exceptional

**seanderlust** (7.5): ""irregardless"" gretchen weiners teas

**aresthormars** (7): My only complaint from this song is that trap hi hat. Like can they tone it down some more and let Mariah do her thing?

**CarlieScion** (7): its cute i guess

**ignitethephoenix** (7): this is good but compared to her other songs here, it’s not that impressive

**kirby31200** (7): I like everything but the first two choruses

**SmileAndTears** (7): I hate trap skitters with a burning passion

**Stryxen** (7): it’s a bop

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): fun fact I got to do some promo for this album 🙈

**vayyiqra** (7): Mariah queen of trap

**Tolk1en** (6): she's done so much better, I don't even know how this song made it to the winners rate...

**bulforster** (5.8): (#24) I love Caution but better than Honey? Idk about that…

**CrimsonROSET** (5.8): ... I just don't see it, sorry.

**MelodramaticLemonade** (5): How did Honey or The Distance rate lower than this in the original rate?

**nooodisaster** (5): A maybe maybe

**camerinian** (4): jesus this song really just has one speed huh? I was tired of this after one listen, how tf did this win a rate

**Frelock\_** (4): Mariah is just not using her vocals to the fullest.

**selegend** (3): never really cared for this

**steelstepladder** (3): Weakest Mariah song here by a mile

**chillbumps5** (2): i think there's too many mariah songs in this rate

**fishingfor8** (2): is this the same melody as No by Meghan trainor?

**TiltControls** (2): The chorus does the rest of this song a disservice

**welcometoNY** (2): this is pretty bad if we're being honest, but bumped up a point because Mariah always gets a pass from me

**ImADudeDuh** (1): I hate this song a lot.

**team\_kockroach** (1): Is this her “Bad Blood”?

**wanderingimpromptu3** (1): It just feels flat and starts grating on me over time

**CarlieScion** (10): so many 11s in a row damn

**CrimsonROSET** (10): This is gonna go out first and you all owe me an apology.

**frogaranaman** (10): this is a fun karaoke song besides the guitar solo but if you’re drunk it’s fun to dance to!

**hikkaru** (10): this is pop perfection but it's gonna be bottom 5 i hate this

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Bleachers deserved to win this rate periyanka

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): yeah this song is great

**shhhneak** (10): a fun upbeat 1975 song is just on another level.

**slimboyfriend** (10): the perfect pop song and it teach u some new words

**steelstepladder** (10): Back when Matt Healy could be pretentious in a fun way

**Stryxen** (10): no I never moved out of my 1975 stan phase. its love hate

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): congratulations to the 1975 for their first and only good song!

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): the way this song is gonna get fucking tanked lmao

**TiltControls** (10): One of my favourite bands that I've discovered over the past few years (though if Matty Healy could shut up for like a minute that'd be great)

**welcometoNY** (10): certainly a choice for this to be the 1975 song that makes it into this rate. it's obviously a god-tier song, just not quite as god-tier as most of the other songs on this album.

**worlds-okayest666** (10): the heartbreaking truth is that the 1975 DO make bops

**team\_kockroach** (9.5): The best of the 1975.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.1): Every The 1975 album has exactly 5 songs that are actually good on it, and this falls exactly in the middle of that range for this album

**camerinian** (9): shut the fuck up Matt Healy <3

**cremeebrulee** (9): how to reconcile the fact that i hate matt healy but also like this . please advise

**hunnybee12** (9): pretentious and annoying but i love it

**ManofOranges** (9): This is yet another song that I do begrudgingly like, although I expect it do to poorly. It just has a certain je ne sais quoi to it.

**selegend** (9): matty healy is annoying but bops are bops and the 1975 has a good amount of those

**skargardin** (9): banger

**starlitsuns** (9): I didn’t realize that this was a song by The 1975 until now. I love the production on this.

**twat\_brained** (9): this was the one 1975 song I dared to allow into my iTunes library

**SmileAndTears** (8.8): It's a good song but that chorus is too repetitive. Like, can you come up with something else?

**1998tweety** (8.5): bop, they dont have many but the ones that do bop hard

**nooodisaster** (8.5): ~~WeLl i kNow ~WhEN yUoRe ArOu~Nd CzU I kNOw ThE sOuNd, i KNoW htE SO~u~nD oF YouR HEaRt~~

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.2): carly outsold but this is another recent grower

**aresthormars** (8): Very catchy and groovy!

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I love songs that are examples of themselves, if that makes sense? Like lyrically the song is about how they know what this person sounds like and so then we as the listeners can infer that the sounds we’re hearing in the instrumental break of this song are meant to evoke what they’re hearing and it’s pretty nice! This is one of the few songs in the rate I hadn’t heard before but I like it.

**Ionlywanttheworld** (8): there are better 1975 songs out there but it's so catchy

**kirby31200** (8): Doesn't break any new ground or anything but it's enjoyable. Pretty cool guitar solo.

**racloves** (8): this is one of like three 1975 songs I actually like

**raicicle** (8): i fear this song’s video is just a way for 1975 fans to pretend they’re above optimism as a concept (even though none of them absorbed the message of the 1975’s video for girls)

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): I ain’t never seen two happy 1975 stans. Always one of them gotta be sad

**vayyiqra** (8): Such a bop I can forgive the awful pretentious lyric ""simple Epicurean philosophy""

**waluigiest** (8): overall its pretty fun!

**wavingwolves** (8): a good song from their second worst album

**WillamThunderfuck** (8): This makes me really cheerful :)

**ReallyCreative** (7.8): this is identical to like ten different indie rock songs I had on repeat in college, not necessarily a bad thing but I've kinda outgrown this

**bespectacIed** (7): The synth pop rate where Chvrches, the only legit synth pop band in the rate, lost; tragic. But the winner's a good song

**engifear** (7): Somebody Else should be here instead

**intheaftermath** (6.7): this sounds like that song written by the bot designed to emulate Eurovision. It's like a slightly worse version of Blue Jeans and Bloody Tears

**suhonyu** (6): cute corporate banger

# 1975 antis, AKA normal people

**jackisboredtoday** (5.7): Matty Healy stop sucking off your own perceived intelligence in the verses challenge

**bulforster** (5.6): (#25) Unnecessary levels of pretentious irony aside, this is a bop.

**Frelock\_** (5): Nice background music I guess.

**fadedblue09** (4.5): Bye that beat got irritating after a minute.

**Roxieloxie** (4): Wait I did a fanmix for a [redacted] big bang and I think the title of it might've come from this??? im gonna ask the author if thats the case

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (2): I have no idea what anybody sees in this band

**ElizabethDDoS** (1): I simply hate everything about this band. Sue me.

**anothertown** (0): I hate this

**ignitethephoenix** (0): this song has great production but why does it sound so annoying. Maybe this is just my 1975 distaste coming through but the chorus is very annoying. This definitely is my least favorite song here by far

**moonagenightmares** (0): can’t stand this whiny douchebag and his overrated little band

**plastichaxan** (0): well it's not a good sound

# Carly Rae Jepsen outsold

**zadooi** (7.5): Put me in the ""Carly Rae Jepsen outsold"" section of the comments.

The only thing that is keeping me from changing it is that I still want to be identified as *that* Spider-Man stan in Popheads. (Yes, I am still that loser who still stans the MCU lmaooo) That and I have no idea how to select multiple flairs here. I really want to have Taylor x Twice x Blackpink flairs now, guys. :((("

4773,2020-11-27 22:10:56,k27cgq,"# stream man's world

**1998tweety** (10): bop, make sure to stream Man's World!!!

**anothertown** (10): You can’t say it didn’t transcend

**aresthormars** (10): Very groovy track of FROOT. Also one of my faves!

**bbfan132** (10): her best song, hopefully it doesn’t flop

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): The Froot era was my Marina staining at its peak.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I liked this one when we initially rated it but as time has gone on I’ve come to REALLY like it! The way she combines themes of youth, time, beauty, and consumption, implying that her sexuality and her appeal are inextricably linked to time and that she’ll rot if someone doesn’t claim her but to claim her is to consume her and leave her broken regardless, and then to play these ideas out against a relentlessly cheerful and almost nauseatingly sweet musical backdrop… it’s very interesting and it always gets the wheels in my head turning.

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (10): talented, brilliant, etc

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Marina said stream Juice and I agree. But side note the more I’ve listened to this song, the more it’s grown on me

**lIIustration** (10): such dreamy product

**ManofOranges** (10): It's kind of an enthralling track, honestly. Poor Florence keeps having to lose to Marina but at least she's lost to songs like Froot, which are honestly quite good.

**moooo566** (10): hard to believe this isn't my eleven

**PuggleMaster** (10): Marina really called out all the gays with the opening of this song. Was never that big of a fan of Marina until I heard the opener to this song.

**runaway3212** (10): Froot is what all popgirlies aspire to be

**skargardin** (10): One of her best vocal performances for sure

**twat\_brained** (10): I'm not as *familiar* with this as other Marina tunes😊I do wish the music video length matched the song's length, however. Am I alone in thinking this is Marina's best song?

**vayyiqra** (10): A horny bop, a highlight of her career. Seeing her do this song live was :flushed:

**waluigiest** (10): the lead up to this era as SO exciting to little gay me

**worlds-okayest666** (10): if marina told me to lay on train tracks id do it

**Ionlywanttheworld** (9.5): seeing this live 2x was incredible

**kirby31200** (9): I couldn't stand this song on first listen but now I love it.

**pat-rickstar** (9): I've never really listened to Marina before but this is really good

**sarcasticsobs** (9): just always a delight

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.7): DAE disco???????

**WeastofEden44** (8.7): This froot DOESN'T look familiar cuz this is the first time I've ever paid attention to this song

**seanderlust** (8.5): this one is gonna be done dirty, I feel it in my rattling bones.

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): What Kind Of Man lets this song win?

**mysario** (8): predicted Juice

**ReallyCreative** (8): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72g2b0xtXQk

**wavingwolves** (8): i love the many metaphors for pussy this song has

**RandomHypnotica** (7.2): a real familiar fruit moment

**Stryxen** (7.1): and this beat all of how big how blue beautiful :/… how bad, how boring... how bitter from me – its pretty good and I like how expensive this song sounds lol


# marina [REDACTED]

**CrimsonROSET** (7): Everyone wants a familiar froot moment, I guess.

**SmileAndTears** (7): I don't care for this

**Frelock\_** (6): Classic melody scheme sort of deal. Very 80s reminiscent.

**nooodisaster** (6): 60% froot juice

**starlitsuns** (6): This didn’t need to be nearly 6 minutes long.

**jackisboredtoday** (5.8): I’m sorry I just never got this song… Marina has good music but I never thought this was it

**ImADudeDuh** (5.1): the best thing about it is that it gave us Marina dragging Charli

**camerinian** (5): I don't get the appeal of Marina and I don't think I ever will. This isn't a bad cut by any means but it really pales in comparison to basically everything else on this list

**InfernalSolstice** (5): marina has never rlly interested me beyond the family jewels

**steelstepladder** (5): Thats not how you spell fruit silly

**suhonyu** (5): prefer her earlier eras

**Roxieloxie** (4): why dose she sing like that

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (4): I just wanna let you all know that I’m very much pro universal basic income, I’m in favor of abolishing rent, and I very much want to eliminate the wealth gap, but Marina is not getting ANY of it, stay broke bitch

**CarlieScion** (3): i really hate this song. not even sorry. all the songs on electra heart and tfj outsold. even orange trees outsold

**fxsparrow** (3): I can't stand her voice

**kappyko** (3): Foot

**bulforster** (2.6): (#40) This song (and Marina in general) just never clicked for me and it goes on a bit too long.

**joshually** (2): I dunno honestly… it’s just… weird

**bespectacIed** (1): this sounds hideous y'all can't be serious about liking this .....

**fadedblue09** (0): Five minutes of hell, dear lord. In my years on this sub, I have never gotten the appeal of Marina. Literally everything about her is done better by her peers. People who stan her are the type to think that stanning flops make you look cool (spoiler: it doesn't). Now that we’ve ditched Tumblr, I hope we also do the same for her career as well.

**TiltControls** (0): wait this is what beat Florence? disservice to fruits from apple to bananas"

**aresthormars** (10): Ba da ba ba da ba ba ha ba da ba ba da ba ba ha

**bbfan132** (10): i love paramore and this song so i can’t give it anything less than a 10 but it will be out early for sure

**bespectacIed** (10): one of my alltime fave rates ever despite the mess and THE ONLY QUEENCEPTION embarrassing herself at Day 1. This win made me smile so much. We made the true best song in the rate win instead of the obvious choices. We deserve an award for this rate

**camerinian** (10): just gut punch my nostalgia why don’t you

**fadedblue09** (10): God I was so close to having another 11 win. Folie stans can stay mad lmao. Maybe if they bothered building a proper consensus on the songs it would have fared better.

**hikkaru** (10): listen vices & virtues deserved so much better and either ballad of mona lisa or nearly witches should have won but this is still one of paramore's best songs and the best from bne so i'm ok with the winner of this rate.. what i'm NOT happy with is how they ate the entire top 4 like wtf

**moooo566** (10): BADA BA BA BADA BA BA BA BADA BA BA BADA BA BAAA

**mysario** (10): I have a blurb for this

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Vices and Virtues and Folie a Deux died for this song to be here, and I'm surprisingly not even mad, it's just THAT good.

**yatcho** (10): Their best song periodt

**Roxieloxie** (9.9): I've been listening to folie alot since the emo rate,,, but i've also been listening to this alot. FOB was very much robbed in that rate and paramore did not deserve to sweep like how they did but, i kinda really enjoy this ://

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): One of the first songs that got me into Paramore. Ignorance outsold from the album however

**kappyko** (9.5): i remember posting this to the PokeFarm forum for a forum game.... these lyrics were so good in elementary school!!!

**Stryxen** (9.4): god I forgot how GOOD this is badabapadababada

**InternetDude19** (9): I'm too young to feel old.

**ManofOranges** (9): Honestly this is kind of a hit

**racloves** (9): bringing back my emo phase

**ReallyCreative** (9): despite all my friends being obsessed with Paramore in high school, I didn't really climb aboard the train until self-titled. As a result I'm just not well versed in the earlier stuff, I get to discover some gems like this though as a result.

**starlitsuns** (9): Ah yes, more emo bops to bop to!

**twat\_brained** (9): great but Ignorance should've won

**waluigiest** (9): Hayley Williams Stan 4ever

**bigbigbee** (8.8): Trying to score this made me realize how much context affects my opinion. This score would be lower for me in the context of its original rate, but I gave a boost here because it’s from one of my favorite, favorite genres ever, which isn’t really represented elsewhere in this list.

**bulforster** (8.6): (#10) All of this hits so hard.

**1998tweety** (8.5): serves a bit

**CarlieScion** (8): this top 4 will forever haunt me

**cremeebrulee** (8): ignorance deserved :(

**Ionlywanttheworld** (8): I love Hayley but this isn't their best

**kirby31200** (8): Fall Out Boy deserved to win this rate. I've always kinda hated how the bridge lyrics sounded like they were building up to something and then don't and just repeat. ""When you've built up a world of magic, because your real life is tragic... yeah you've built up a world of magic"" Lazy!

**selegend** (8): my peak emo era song

**slimboyfriend** (8): I feel like I’m 13 and mad at my dad again

**steelstepladder** (8): The better of the two Paramore songs but still not their best

**wavingwolves** (8): the emo rate was a mess but this is AMAZING and i need it to not go out on day 1

**seanderlust** (7.7): this one hurts, especially since I just gave this one a ten. but this is a stacked rate and in this lineup I have to rate it a bit lower than I normally would. this is all stars, baby.

**runaway3212** (7.5): Not my favourite

**fishingfor8** (7): not my genre but still enjoyable

**Frelock\_** (7): Another song I haven't heard before, but pretty enjoyable.

**jasannn** (7): sounds like debut demi or does debut demi sound like paramore

**skargardin** (7): I don't think this should've won its respective rate but it does bop

**SmileAndTears** (7): I've never liked Hayley's voice :/

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): if you’re still listening to this in 2020 and have big goth tiddies dms are open 😈

**vayyiqra** (7): Yes I only listen to After Laughter and ""Misery Business"" like a basic Pophead but this is good

# did not shop at hot topic

**CrimsonROSET** (6.5): The trauma that rate brought... mess.

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.5): day 1 song

**hunnybee12** (6): it’s calling out my qurantine coping mechanisms rn and i dont like it

**ImADudeDuh** (6): still one of the worst rate results ever (but the reveal was fun af)

**moonagenightmares** (6): boring indeed

**nooodisaster** (6): I think the fairytale lyrics are interesting but kinda on the nose, and along with the production just contributes to this song feeling more middle school than Paramore is.

**ElizabethDDoS** (5): I like their poppier stuff way more.

**TiltControls** (5): unremarkably alright

**astrologicalangel** (4): this should not have won and I'm still salty

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): this won something?

**cloudbustingmp3** (3.1): i really only like paramore from self-titled onward

**1998tweety** (10): massive bop

**fadedblue09** (10): Somehow this Hollywood Records bop managed to age better than most of The Fame, Animal, and most pop girl releases in 2009-10. Y’all can complain about her longevity however you want, but sometimes she just gets the good songs.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): a fucking bop idc idc idc idc y’all can stay hating on selena the second she breathes.

**intheaftermath** (10): fun fact! this song, for some reason, is played all the time at FIRST Robotics competitions

**jasannn** (10): One of her best songs tbh.

**mysario** (10): I miss peak Selena

**runaway3212** (10): Selena makes a valid argument for why she does deserve a music career.

**selegend** (10): that chorus is godly

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): i can hear god

**twat\_brained** (10): Selena's best song and she was

**wanderingimpromptu3** (10): Catchy, melodic, perfect bubblegum

**worlds-okayest666** (10): i love how literally nothing else on kiss & tell sounds like this at all. like there’s one or two more electropop-ish songs but that’s it LMAO

**bespectacIed** (9): Electropop perfection. Idgaf, selena was right 'baby' does have 4 syllables

**camerinian** (9): who the fuck even are The Scene, and how did Selena's music magically stop being good when they left? Are they wizards?

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): whit* st*n twitter gays: iT c*Ms nAtUraLly tO mE 💦👅

**hikkaru** (9): the way this is still one of her best songs... YOU ARE THE THUNDERRR AND I AM THE LIIIGHTNIIIING

**hunnybee12** (9): this is a nostalgia score kiss and tell was one of the first (and only) cds i ever bought

**Ionlywanttheworld** (9): I remember seeing the MV on disney channel

**plastichaxan** (9): bop one of her best

**jackisboredtoday** (8.8): still maybe the best song of Selena’s entire career, and also maybe the best single of that whole era of Disney star singles

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Of Selena’s hits with The Scene this isn’t my favorite but it’s still a pretty good song. I don’t think anyone expected a teenybopper pop star like Selena Gomez to release such a simmering, surprisingly sophisticated electro pop song but she really did that! Also I still really want the dress that she wears in the video, I tried looking it up on a bunch of blogs and I can’t find it anywhere so it must have been custom and I’m forever sad. I don’t even wear dresses but she looks so cute in it.

**pat-rickstar** (8.3): Thunder and lightning, it's getting exciting (the lyrics in the chorus reminds me of this Eurovision song by Sergey Lazarev - Eurovision rate when?)

**anothertown** (8): first thing a girl did was a bop!

**AtomicViolet** (8): Never heard this before and expected it to be meh based on the Selena I've heard before but came out pleasantly surprised

**wavingwolves** (8): ok yeah this is one of selena's best songs

**RandomHypnotica** (7.9): I miss The Scene, I wonder what they're up to now

**akanewasright** (7.5): Selena Gomez always sounds best when she’s singing over a dance beat. This song basically defined her entire career as a singer (or at least within this band), and thank god it did, or we wouldn’t have gotten Rock God, or Off The Chain or all of When The Sun Goes Down.

**PuggleMaster** (7.5): Why doesn't this sound as good as i remember it sounding :uhh:. It sounds very muffled compared to every song on this rate (except that Carole song).

**WeastofEden44** (7.2): Tbh I remembered it being better

**kirby31200** (7): Middle school bop

**racloves** (7): the scene>solo Selena

**waluigiest** (7): it’s fine. But I’m still mad that it won - their album was far weaker than the other 3, and Demi and JB had stronger songs for the win too. Selenators win again :-(

**jsonphile** (6.5): haven’t heard this song in years, but it’s better than I remembered. Still nothing amazing though

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): who’s the man saying yeah in the background

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): not as good as 8 year old me remembered it being

**bbfan132** (6): hit the lights and a year without rain outsold

**skargardin** (6): it's ok

# /u/RoxieLoxie and her friends

**SmileAndTears** (6): Nope

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Selena Gomez used to make mediocre Disney music and now she’s great, and Demi Lovato used to make great Disney music and now she’s mediocre

**vayyiqra** (6): Love Selena but this is far from her best song with The Scene (that would be Love You Like a Love Song) but it's okay

**Frelock\_** (5): Reminds me of the cassettes my parents would play to improve my self-esteem and remind me to not do drugs.

**ManofOranges** (5): I honestly can't believe this song actually won its rate. Well... yes I can but that doesn't make it any less unbelievable. This song is ok to me, but when it's surrounded by so many other good songs that actually deserved their win, it kind of pales in comparison.

**TiltControls** (5): ""When we collide sparks fly"" can we swap Miranda into this rate

**seanderlust** (4.5): i haven't seen it so i don't know, but why do I feel like the music video for this song was just a slideshow of selena gomez pictures made in windows movie maker

**CrimsonROSET** (4): That rate was rough.

**sarcasticsobs** (4): sure. Chorus is kinda catchy though

**Stryxen** (4): natura11y jk this is not good

**welcometoNY** (4): a cute bop, definitely one of selena's more tolerable songs, but not really worthy of rate winner status

**lIIustration** (3): very artificial

**cloudbustingmp3** (2.1): i see why she considers revival her debut

**CarlieScion** (2): this is terrible. in the literal sense.

**ElizabethDDoS** (2): Well, this is na2rally bland as fuck.

**bulforster** (1.6): (#45) Go girl give us nothing! I feel like she doesn’t use more than like, three notes in this whole song...

**aresthormars** (1): Not a fan of this song. The visuals of the song look like the visuals of We Are Never Ever Going Back Together of 1989 Tour.

**cremeebrulee** (1): sorry i genuinely hate this song

**kappyko** (1): this sounds like farts

**steelstepladder** (1): This stands out like a sore thumb among songs like Running Up That Hill and Your Best American Girl

**nooodisaster** (0): I couldn't get through this more than once. If you rocked to this as a kid, dope. But I gotta say - MITSU DESU... SOCIAL DISTANCE - to this one.

**ReallyCreative** (0): the only rate Selena Gomez should win is the Charity Rate because any score above a 5 is tax deductible. Now that my federally-mandated Selena Gomez drag is out of the way, this song is just way too generic for this rate. This is a kind of song that has been done much better, many times, by many artists.

**1998tweety** (10): massive bop, I miss this Kesha. High Road was awful

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): The Warrior era is always going to be my favorite from Kesha.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): One of the first pop songs I ever really fell in LOVE with and it still holds a special place in my heart to this day. I think we’ve all had one or two great nights out with our friends where we were just carefree and happy and even the most mundane things felt like part of some grand adventure just because you were all doing it together and this song really captures that. I think a big part of what made her connect with her audience so well is that she makes a night out with your friends sound like the most important thing in the universe; she treats all of the stupid little details with such reverence that you can’t help but feel nostalgic for all the silly little moments from your life that, with the context Kesha provides, might have actually been magic all along.

**hikkaru** (10): we love kesha

**ImADudeDuh** (10): No song makes me feel more like an extrovert than this one.

**joshually** (10): THIS IS MY FAVORITE KE$HA SONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**kappyko** (10): WAIT............

**lIIustration** (10): trouble in the dark t-t-trouble in the dark

**ManofOranges** (10): I don't have much to say about this one except that it's wonderful

**nooodisaster** (10): Beethoven has been real quiet ever since this dropped.

**PuggleMaster** (10): While I prefer most of Warrior to this song. You can't deny that this is a 10 out of 10. I know Dr. L*ke has tainted this era, but I still think this was some of her best work!

**skargardin** (10): smash of the century yaas

**starlitsuns** (10): I’m fairly sure that people born in that time frame where we were alive during 9/11 but remember nothing are old-school Kesha fans without realizing it. This song is fun, it’s a bop, and I wish Dr. Puke would actually receive punishment for his alleged actions against Kesha instead of getting another Number 1 with the Say So remix.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): thank you 🐼

**TiltControls** (10): This song really shows how Kesha can be the queen of party when she wants to

**worlds-okayest666** (10): this wasnt my 11 in its original rate but it should have been bc this is a fucking BANGER!!!

**camerinian** (9.5): holy fuck that last chorus buildup is god-tier, that hook is fantastic, and the rapping is

**mysario** (9.5): ha ha this is cute I'm lonely

**SmileAndTears** (9.5): Queen of furries

**anothertown** (9): “Saw you lea- / ning again- / sthat old re- / cordmachine” is iconic opening phrasing

**Ionlywanttheworld** (9): I wish she had saved this for a later single and not right after Die Young

**seanderlust** (9): not to be that youtube comment that's like ""WhO sTiLl LiStEnS iN 2020"" but like...I actually still listen to this for non-nostalgia reasons. it still slaps.

**Stryxen** (9): THE party anthem

**bigbigbee** (8.5): This song is brought down by the sung-through part of its verses for me, because the choruses are transcendental. (Personal taste - I feel like the melody could be more interesting. Someone should mash this up with Nee by Perfume.)

**kirby31200** (8.5): I like it but didn't Kesha already make this song

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): I saw this tiktok of a gay roller dancing down the street with this song playing in the background the day that trump lost the election, and that epitomizes this song for me

**jackisboredtoday** (8.2): YUM like a lollipop

**CrimsonROSET** (8.1): I guess I'm more shocked this won? I mean, shoutouts, but out of all songs in that rate, this is the winner?

**WeastofEden44** (8.1): Key-$-Ha really did that huh

**jasannn** (8): A cute pop song but Die Young is surperior.

**ReallyCreative** (8): it's like, not even a top 10 Kesha song what is it doing here in this rate. still a bop

**Tolk1en** (8): lazy lines but sitll a bop

**twat\_brained** (8): Can we honestly call this song more worthy of the win than ""Stay""?

**runaway3212** (7): It's good, but not worth the hype it gets

**succulentils** (7): Why is she trashing the Mexi mart smh

**vayyiqra** (7): Kind of surprised this won but I like it

# people who may recognize that a Dr. Luke-produced Kesha song has not aged the best

**WillamThunderfuck** (6.5): It's a cute song, but imo it does not compete with the other songs on this list at all

**aresthormars** (6): I hate that I think I can hear this as a Katy Perry song.

**bbfan132** (6): kind of fun but it doesn’t do much for me

**jsonphile** (6): ....I know this is controversial on this sub but I just don’t really like Kesha’s early work, it can be a bit grating

**RandomHypnotica** (6): Me listening to this song: ""C'Mon please end""

**Roxieloxie** (6): I only really know this era of kesha from when she was on victorious

**steelstepladder** (6): Not my choice of Kesha unfortunately. Wouldn't be sad if this went out early tbh.

**waluigiest** (6): I was honestly not super engaged by this era of Kesha

**aestheticen** (5): C’Mon, out of all her songs, this one?

**cocosairdep** (5): Cute little bop. Sounds too dated tho.

**Frelock\_** (5): Nice enough but not my style.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): this is so underwhelming

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): maybe 2012 was worse than 2020

**bulforster** (4): (#33) This is so fun but, since I'm splitting hairs for this rate, also pretty clumsy.

**selegend** (4): it’s alright

**zadooi** (4): Old Kesha was never good and I think it's time we have that conversation.

**ElizabethDDoS** (3): Never liked Kesha that much.

**bespectacIed** (2): back to back dr luke songs lmao

**chillbumps5** (2): reminds me of tik tok

**wavingwolves** (2): the warrior album cover makes me yearn for simpler times

**cloudbustingmp3** (1): warrior is one of my least favorite pop albums of all time and tbh in general kesha's music is just not my thing despite loving her as a person

**fadedblue09** (1): Everything Kesha did before Rainbow (sans Timber) was unlistenable garbage, and no amount of pOpTiMIsM can change my mind on that.

**sandyfishnets** (1): her voice annoys me

**welcometoNY** (1): just generally unremarkable. inoffensive but nothing i would listen to on purpose"

**1998tweety** (10): Y'all better leave your biases at the door and give this the 10 it deserves.

**aresthormars** (10): Lana fits in the soundtrack and it makes sense she is singing in a Gatsby movie. Rick Knowles also did a great job in production!

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): this is THE lana song tbh

**runaway3212** (10): this is my favourite Lana track

**succulentils** (10): The percussions are so good

**worlds-okayest666** (10): i feel guilty giving lana a 10 but fuck this is so good

**mysario** (9.5): can't wait for people to trash this just because PH turned around on LDR

**seanderlust** (9.3): i never actually saw the great gatsby but I remember the soundtrack was actually one of the best OSTs I had ever heard.

**plastichaxan** (9): maybe this would've been a ten before...you know

**vayyiqra** (9): No Main Pop Girl around today does ballads like Lana

**ignitethephoenix** (8.8): I keep forgetting the version I have in my library is the orchestral version which is vastly superior to the original. Still my favorite Lana song

**ReallyCreative** (8.8): Lana's done better, but for a one-off soundtrack song it's pretty fucking good

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Was really into this song back in college but maybe I overplayed it because I’m kinda over it. I love the drama of it though, Lana’s sound feels at home on soundtracks and I hope she keeps making this work a priority because it’s good for her. Also [the situation with this song not being nominated for the Oscars was very interesting and actually taught me a lot about the failures of the Academy.](https://time.com/11728/lana-del-rey-young-and-beautiful-oscar-snub/)

**urlocalcracchead** (8.3): This girl needs to stay out of drama so I can continue to stan her

**bigbigbee** (8): The opening notes make me want to listen to the Song of Healing from Majora’s Mask. It’s definitely good, I just think she’s made better in this vein.

**joshually** (8): great song, beautiful song

**kirby31200** (8): The only good thing to come out of the new Great Gatsby movie

**PuggleMaster** (8): Racist queen snapped!

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): honestly after this song we should’ve seen republiclana coming

**waluigiest** (8): will you still love me when I’m no longer young and bootylicious?

**zadooi** (8): This would be a full point lower if I didn't love the scene in The Great Gatsby where this plays.

**engifear** (7.7): ""I've seen the world, lit it up."" Someone stop her! She's spreading COVID again!

**starlitsuns** (7.5): This would get more points if we were considering the orchestral version, which is so dreamy and beautiful.

**CarlieScion** (7): this was one of my most played songs in 2014. listening to it in 2020 feels just really weird

**Frelock\_** (7): You know, good vocals accompanied by an excellent classical arrangement.

# gang sunk that dunker

**Ionlywanttheworld** (7): there are better Lana songs

**lIIustration** (7): overproduced

**nooodisaster** (7): vampires cant relate :(((

**RandomHypnotica** (6.8): I can't believe THIS is the only Lana song that's ever won, and we've rated her entire discography ugh

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.4): eh

**akanewasright** (6): This song is lovely, but a lot of the lyrics are just fucking awful. Lana is usually much better at bridges than this.

**bbfan132** (6): i used to love this when i was younger but now it sounds very overproduced and kind of dull… still not bad though

**camerinian** (6): this is a mid-tier Lana song that only got so many props cos it came out immediately after Born To Die when literally anything she made would have been swallowed up by desperate sad gays

**frogaranaman** (6): this movie was such a mess

**ManofOranges** (6): I mean, it's a fine song, but there's not much that intrigues me. In the grand tradition Lana songs for me, it's a pretty middling experience.

**steelstepladder** (6): This chorus is great but outside of a handful of songs I still don't like a lot of Lana

**twat\_brained** (6): Yellow Flicker Beat was robbed

**moonagenightmares** (5.7): what else does karen woolridge grant even have going for her aside from that and her father’s wealth

**welcometoNY** (5.6): it's pretty, but it's also very paint-by-numbers Lana and the sentiment is a bit on-the-nose

**CrimsonROSET** (5.5): Question for the culture: is this joke overused yet? I'd say about as overused as this song format, which Lana plays completely straight, which usually means we should focus on the lyricism, but I'm not a big fan of her songwriting ('he makes me shine like diamonds' doesn't quite do it for me) so I gain nothing from this.

**anothertown** (5): I feel like this could easily be a Weeknd song

**fadedblue09** (5): I have already made it clear in the past rates that I am not fond of her music, and this was way before she started digging her own grave. That being said, I'll give her credit when it's due: this orchestral pop is a better fit for her voice than whatever Ultraviolence was.

**jasannn** (5): I honestly hate that movie.

**SmileAndTears** (5): Idk it tries to be so grand and dramatic but the sound doesn't match with the lyrical content

**slimboyfriend** (4.9): why does she ask a question then answer it in the next line

**kappyko** (4): i cant believe we ran out of lana albums to rate

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (4): two adjectives lana is rapidly decreasing in

**bulforster** (3.2): (#37) This is pretty, but not my thing.

**cloudbustingmp3** (1): old and ugly and makes me wish i had another 0

**ElizabethDDoS** (1): We've evolved past the need for Lana Del Rey. Would have been my second 0 if that were an option.

**Roxieloxie** (1): yes im balladphobic but this also isnt good

**skargardin** (1): bye

**suhonyu** (1): i'm really not a big fan of her, but I know this subreddit adores her so whatever

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): to this day i am still unable to tell the difference between any lana del rey song

**ImADudeDuh** (0): not this

**pat-rickstar** (0): I feel a bit mean giving out my 0 when I'm scoring almost everything else a 7 or above… but this is so boring I'm sorry how did this win a rate

**Stryxen** (0): this is a less than mediocre lana song and I feel like picking on an easy target"

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (10): LET'S GET DOWN TO BUSINESS TO DEFEAT THE HUNS

**hikkaru** (10): the best disney song PERIOD!!

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I don’t trust people who dislike this

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Mulan is the best film of the Disney renaissance besides Aladdin, yup.

**intheaftermath** (10): Truly deserving of the love it gets. Donny Osmond's performance is immaculate. I think this rate is just revealing that I'm a theatre kid at heart

**J\_Toe** (10): was not expecting Disney in amongst regular songs, lol, but it's still a 10

**jsonphile** (10): literally the only Donny Osmond song I’d rate higher than a 5

**kirby31200** (10): Best Disney song of the whole 90s

**ManofOranges** (10): This song is a 10 for the nostalgia factor alone, and I'm not sorry about it. It's wonderful, it's fantastic, and Mulan has some of the best songs Disney has ever made

**moooo566** (10): a powerful competitor

**mysario** (10): top 3 Disney movies with a bottom 3 remake

**nooodisaster** (10): Fully the dark horse of this rate.

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): this song goes slap the fuck off for no reason, and to this day it still gives me chills. the whole ending, like bruh BRUH this song is amazing. it slaps, it hits, it bops. when the instruments drop out and it's just the vocals? BITCH YOUR FAVE COULD NEEEEEEVER.

**raicicle** (10): perhaps one of the best disney songs

**Roxieloxie** (10): Have you guys seen the Historian on twitter who did a thread/video about the cultural accuracies/inaccuracies of mulan? it was really interesting and i recommend! Anyway the song is a bop but anytime i hear it I will always think of the team four star version unfortunately

**selegend** (10): i’ll ignore the fact that a white man sang this bc he killed it

**starlitsuns** (10): Iconic as heck. Live action Mulan flopped for several reasons, and not making it a musical was one of the less important ones.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): i still haven’t actually watched mulan yet

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.6): i wanted to give this a 10 but it’s slightly not as good as i remember. still great though

**TiltControls** (9.5): Sometimes a little over-rated for Disney songs, but it's still a classic sing along song

**wanderingimpromptu3** (9.5): I love this, it just doesn't quite reach catharsis

**CritneySpearz** (9.1): not me not realizing this was Donny Osmond who sang this… omg

**1998tweety** (9): This is a trans/bi anthem right? We stan

**jasannn** (9): Did anyone actually think the live-action remake would be good?

**nootnoot781** (9): maybe the homophobe snapped on this ome

**racloves** (9): Mulan is my favourite character and means so much to me

**sarcasticsobs** (9): honestly i expected that i’d be tired of this song by now but NOPE NOPE NOPE

**steelstepladder** (9): A touch overrated in terms of Disney but it's still one of Mulan's best

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): the mere fact this is absent in the remake made me skip it entirely

**camerinian** (8.5): I can make you a MAAAAA-AAAAA-AAAAA-aaaa-aaaaaannnnnnnn

**Ionlywanttheworld** (8.5): Reflection is the superior song from Mulan and I will die on that hill

**suhonyu** (8.5): come thru misogyny

**aresthormars** (8): I like Reflection more tho.

**PuggleMaster** (8): I had no idea this was Donny Osmond omg.

**runaway3212** (8): Mulan is an overrated Disney movie and this song is its worst. The last part is pretty great though

**waluigiest** (8): Disney really ate it up with this one

**SmileAndTears** (7.8): Iss ok

**shhhneak** (7.7): I don’t care if it’s 3am I will scream sing “BE A MAN” every time.

**twat\_brained** (7.3): m*n is a slur and this song is hella sexist but Donny can belt

# Donny Osmond publicly came out against gay marriage in 2008

**anothertown** (6.5): yes this scene is one of the best in Disney… but the song? Idk, I was never in Band or Theatre and I’ve never said “Wholesome Keanu Chungus”

**bigbigbee** (6.5): It’s good but I suspect it won its original rate on the merit of the (incredible) montage sequence in the movie, not on the song alone; I think it suffers divorced from that context. Still good though!

**jackisboredtoday** (6.4): Mulan is a good movie but I never really saw the songs as the most memorable part tbh

**WeastofEden44** (6.1): Well you girls absolute silence look good!

**fadedblue09** (6): Lemme guess...Li Shang must be a gay icon that I'm not aware of? Otherwise I have no idea how this won.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I loved this song so much as a kid but as I’ve matured it’s just started to sound more obnoxious than anything else. I dunno, maybe one too many overzealous Disney loving theatre kids have ruined this with their spontaneous singalongs.

**InfernalSolstice** (6): this works to mixed results outside of the context of a sountrack/the movie

**ReallyCreative** (6): like the most overrated Disney song but it still isn't bad

**vayyiqra** (6): Okay but we need to talk about if the Huns are overhated or not

**welcometoNY** (6): i feel like this is a bit paint-by-numbers musical theatre. it's not bad, it's just reminiscent of other musical theater songs that are far better.

**InternetDude19** (5.1): I don't have nostalgia for this, and it reminds me of annoying theatre kids.

**bbfan132** (5): donny sounds good but it’s still mediocre

**cloudbustingmp3** (5): reflection deserved

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (5): I feel like I am going to get so much shit for this but I haven't seen Mulan as a child so I have no personal nostalgia for this song fsdkjdgkgdfjklfjdkl. Apologizes for the low score. The Lion King is more in my alley than Mulan.

**lIIustration** (5): I don’t like disney music and this isn’t an exception

**PointlessBibliophage** (5): i'm sorry being a man is cringe

**skargardin** (5): there are better classic disney songs out there than this overhyped song

**Stryxen** (5): this is an opinion I hold

**AtomicViolet** (4): Apologies to my FTM brothers but the thought of being made into a man is so gross to me.

**hunnybee12** (4): snooze

**kappyko** (4): the song about gaston eating eggs is so much better than this

**RandomHypnotica** (4): I hate listening to musical tracks out of context, it just feels so weird and wrong

**CrimsonROSET** (3): I think this is the score I feel the worst about. Like, it's a fine Disney song- but it doesn't quite compare to all these actual pop songs.

**joshually** (3): sorry, this song is not really that good, and… it’s sexist, and the live action movie just made everything worse.

**bulforster** (2.4): (#41) This is fine, but a rate winner? This wouldn't even cross my mind when thinking of the best Disney song.

**engifear** (2): I'm extremely afraid of people who just listen to Disney songs outside of the movie. Actually, I'm afraid of anyone who still watches Disney movies in general.

**fishingfor8** (2): never watched Mulan as a kid for some reason

**wavingwolves** (2): if i never listened to this song again it would make no difference in my life

**CarlieScion** (10): EH EH EH EHO! they spilled

**frogaranaman** (10): this song is highkey genius

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Wow a song about an apocalypse happening and wondering how we can be better than it, i wonder why i love this in 2020. Anyways, this was always a fucking iconic song.

**joshually** (10): this is my first time hearing this song. IT’S REALLY GOOD?????????????

**moonagenightmares** (10): when i heard this as a kid i thought they were chanting a slur

**mysario** (10): what can't be understated are how great these drums are and how well they carry the song

**Roxieloxie** (10): oh hey this one won my rate. Towards the end of the due date for the mens rate this started getting lower scores cause of covid (apparently this was too depressing and timely) so im interested to see how it will do here. Anyways stream Doom Days and Wild World on spotify

**runaway3212** (10): This song really changed how I looked at pop music even though it's not really pop

**TiltControls** (10): I wish Bastille was able to get more hits in the US (that aren't named Happier- I hate that song), cause they really deserve it

**pat-rickstar** (9): It does slap but the level of quality in this rate prevents me from scoring it higher

**PuggleMaster** (9): This song takes me back to when i was happy with life, which in turns just makes me more depressed :)

**starlitsuns** (9): I’m a sucker for that one phase in 2013-2014 where folk and rock music were all over the Hot 100 (or at least on the pop radio stations) and this reminds me of those vibes.

**WillamThunderfuck** (9): Aww I had to perform this song for my music class in high school so I have some fond memories of this. Also played this to get hyped the day before I visited Pompeii, so this song just radiates good vibes.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): Wow, I was so obsessed with this song. I still enjoyed this song because the verses were strong. Such a shame that the chorus felt lacking for some reason so I am deducting one point for it.

**intheaftermath** (8): I was going through a middle school existential crisis when this song was climbing the charts. Good song to worry to

**Ionlywanttheworld** (8): Dan Smith is hot

I hate this guy’s voice and the mindless, droning production, but I do have to give points for originality because it is unique I guess (though not in the scope of their discography). I’ll always associate this song with “Safe and Sound” by Capital Cities (I might be messing up the timeline but they were big around the same time, right?) due to the similar lyrical themes and musical structures and that song just walks all over this one with six inch heels.

**bulforster** (3.4): (#36) Kinda slaps, but these lyrics feel a bit hollow.

**cloudbustingmp3** (2): ashy like the real pompeii

# is this a bad thing?

**quinnpsych** (6): This song used to be the theme song of a group of kids at my high school for their minecraft youtube channel, so I can't hear the start of this song without thinking about some awful minecraft content"

4815,2020-11-27 20:46:57,k27cgq,"# people who watched Aladdin (2019)

**1998tweety** (10): Pop perfection. I'm sure the people who tank this cause ""they can't get into k-pop cause of the language barrier"" are probably Ariana stans.

**aestheticen** (10): they paved the way

**agentofscranton** (10): Co-hosting this rate was both simultaneously the most stressful and most fun experience I have ever had on this sub. Even though my personal 11 (Catallena) was unjustly robbed, it's hard to disagree with Genie having won the rate - it's an undeniable classic by one of, if not the most iconic group that k-pop has ever birthed. Those pulsing beats, those impeccable vocals, the styling in the video, the leg choreography that led to me having a swollen ankle when I smacked it against my bedpost attempting to perform it. 사랑해 소녀 시대!

**bespectacIed** (10): 💗 The rate I co-hosted 💗 Btw this heart emoji is the exact background of the Genie mv lol. Shameless tooting of my own horn, but this rate was great. Iconic songs, hilarious robberies, very varied day 3, amazing dark horse top 3 (eung eung SOTY), a neck-and-neck top 2. And finally, objectively the greatest k-pop song of all time as the winner. DJ, you know what to do

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): y'all will never let me live down giving this a 0 in the original rate and i deserve that. i was a dumb binch for not realizing how great this is even if 4 Walls is better

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): I say this as someone who is FINALLY immersed into K-pop this year, the results of the K-Pop Retirement Rate were BRUTAL. It's already clear that SNSD will win that rate, but the question was ""Which song from SNSD is going to be the winner""? I was expecting that I Got a Boy will win. But it makes sense that Genie is the actual winner of the rate. This is the song that defined SNSD's legacy. The fact that this was used during the news coverage of [this year's elections in South Korea](https://twitter.com/SoneSupport_/status/1250373974392889345) solidified their legacy.

**imasalesman** (10): Iconic

**intheaftermath** (10): I'm not super familiar with KPOP but this was so good, I just have to listen to their entire discography

**jasannn** (10): DJ PUT IT BACK ONNNN!!!!

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): one of the best kpop songs ever yup yup

**raicicle** (10): iconic

**sarcasticsobs** (10): **kim taeyeon, if you read this I’m free on thursday night and would like to hang out outdoors, 6 feet apart, while wearing masks. please respond to this and then hang out with me outdoors, 6 feet apart, while wearing masks on thursday night when i’m free**

**selegend** (10): this will probably be one of the first 5 songs out because xenophobia even though it is pop perfection

**twat\_brained** (10): This, ""Touch"", ""Damaged"" and ""Say My Name"" are just on that skyscraping echelon which all other girl groups can usually only ever dream of reaching.

**wavingwolves** (10): this shouldn't have been the winner of the rate it was in but it's still a blast of a song

**Roxieloxie** (9.8): I always discover really fun kpop songs from the cumulative rates like this. It's a fun lil bop that makes me want to jump around my room and sing into a hair brush, what more can you ask for in 2020

**fadedblue09** (9.7): It’s grown on me a lot since I did the rate, but I still think it lacks that little oomph factor to becoming true pop perfection. Taeyeon snapped with her vocals though.

**mysario** (9.6): minus 0.1 point for every wall this tore down

**starlitsuns** (9.5): The production? Flawless. I haven’t dived enough into the k-pop scene, but this is a serious bop!

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9.5): oh i hear sumn

**hunnybee12** (9): i'm surprised this was the highest rated snsd track but it's still great

**kappyko** (9): popheads will be like ""OMG i don't care that they're asian i know a bop when i hear one!!!""

**ReallyCreative** (8.7): wait a minute girls, this is a serve

**bigbigbee** (8): I think that if I heard this song for the first time this year I’d score it lower, but I can’t rate this song objectively because this comeback was so ICONIC back in 2009/2010 and I’m instantly transported back. Uh, I never noticed how annoying the outro is back then, though.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): why does this sound ripped from a music video at the beginning and end? I really like the verses of the song but the chorus is just weaker than the rest of the song which is disappointing

**kirby31200** (8): The end is adorable

**lIIustration** (8): , I like the claps in the background

**nooodisaster** (8): wait... was Gee in this rate?? Did Gee lose this rate??! Isllamaphobia smh

**runaway3212** (8): This is not a bad song, but I feel like kpop has had a lot of better hits

**vayyiqra** (8): Never heard this before but it slaps

**aresthormars** (7): A good bop! And this is coming from a person who is lukewarm to K-Pop. Sounds like a mix of Justin Timberlake and Kesha.

**jsonphile** (7): not really a k-pop fan

**PuggleMaster** (7): A cute song but it's a little dated for my taste.

**Stryxen** (7): a bit of a bop. dj play this exactly once.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Aladdin is typing...

# white people and/or Amber stans

**bbfan132** (6.5): it’s ok but they have better songs

**RandomHypnotica** (6.5): The chorus just sounds really bland to me, just a really lifeless homogenous single tone of noise

**akanewasright** (6): This is cute

**CarlieScion** (6): it just doesnt bop as much as i want it to

**CrimsonROSET** (6): I gave Abba a 2.5, I gave Lady Gaga a 1, and this is still the score I think I'll get the most shit for.

**hikkaru** (6): snsd has much better songs and 4 walls was robbed

**ImADudeDuh** (6): why is there so much background noise in this song? I know there’s like 10 people in the song but jeez

**joshually** (6): it’s like cute

**skargardin** (6): GG has much better titles than this, still perplexed as to how it won the rate

**SmileAndTears** (6): Why does this sound like shitty french pop from 2009/2012

**waluigiest** (6): mild bop

**anothertown** (5): I can’t really crack this era of Kpop

**ElizabethDDoS** (5): This rate had Wonder Girls and they FLOPPED, so I'm kinda bitter ngl. Stream Tell Me.

**Frelock\_** (5): Serviceable

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): To this day I’m confused that this was the winner of that rate, there were SO many good songs in it and this is so “meh.” That said the “I’m genie for you boy” line is annoyingly catchy, I find myself saying it a lot.

**Ionlywanttheworld** (5): I can't not hear the laugh used in the MV as the kids on Tatooine in The Phantom Menace

**ManofOranges** (5): No offense to these girls but for a kpop song, I was expecting something a little more impactful, instead I got this

**steelstepladder** (5): Ugh, I've only started getting into Kpop last week I don't have a good barometer of what qualifies as good yet. I don't see myself returning to this though :/

**welcometoNY** (4.3): this won a rate? serving throwaway album track from a c-list popstar who peaked in 2012 realness.

**chillbumps5** (4): why does this sound like justin timberlake

**seanderlust** (4): this sounds like a demo that would leak on youtube

**bulforster** (2.2): (#42) Feels like it's pulling its punches somehow. I'm not really into Kpop but am a bit confused how this beat Gee."

**aestheticen** (10): This is truly one of the best electronic tracks of all time

**anothertown** (10): Rocks my shit from second 1

**aresthormars** (10): This song is iconic for me. I miss this Zedd, the one who has no ticking clock and vocoder all the time.

**camerinian** (10): damn I love this MATTHEW KOMA feat Foxes song

**frogaranaman** (10): literally one of the best commercial house songs of all time and you can @me

**hunnybee12** (10): idc i love this so much

**ImADudeDuh** (10): why are people hating this song so much? More presst glynnecels i guess...

**jasannn** (10): I remember one time, my roommate singing this song at the top of his lungs in the shower and I've loved this song ever since.

**joshually** (10): god this gives me flashbacks to going to EDC dressed like a basic festival slut and being a young dumb ho… ugh I love it so much! Take me baaaaaack

**mysario** (10): reminder that this was an iconic moment in PH history - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aV9WLxxGslQ&lc

**PuggleMaster** (10): Back when Zedd didn't make the same variation of the same song :heart_eyes: (No slander towards 365 and Never Really Over!)

**runaway3212** (10): Yes this deserved to beat Rather Be.

**starlitsuns** (10): The second song that got me into EDM (the first being We Found Love) so of course this gets the score it gets.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): the fact this one the edm rate is still the best moment in rate history goodbye clean bandit

**worlds-okayest666** (10): idk man i dont like zedd but this is such an undeniable classic and it gives me such nostalgia, i cant give this anything but a ten

**succulentils** (9.5): The only reason I'm not giving this a 10 is idk about these lyrics. Absolute banger though

**RandomHypnotica** (9.2): Listening to Clarity gives me a painful flashback to when I had to make a mashup in highschool with absolutely 0 musical knowledge or technical ability (at the time), and I chose to put the lyrics of this over the instrumental of The Mother We Share and it didn't work at ALL, but I had literally no idea how to make it better

**ignitethephoenix** (9): still laughing at how sour some people are that this one over rather be, glyncels keeping suffering

**plvstvcbvrds** (9): this song came out the year or two after i graduated (i will not tell from what, back off) and i remember scream singing it from a sunroof because i was so excited and happy for once. it's a good song, it's great for pregaming and summer shenanigans.

**racloves** (9): foxes is so underrated

**vayyiqra** (9): Even though it's good I feel bad that this is the only song Foxes is known for (at least outside the UK) and that's too bad because she has lots of bops and is underrated as hell

**1998tweety** (8.5): Rather Be was ROBBED

**bbfan132** (8.5): still enjoyable 7 years later

**Stryxen** (8.5): had never heard this before and Zedd doesn’t really do it for me usually but Foxes sounds great and they complement each other surprisingly well

**suhonyu** (8.5): the edm collapse

**WillamThunderfuck** (8.5): To me this sounds very similar to a lot of songs from 2012 but it's still cute so

**welcometoNY** (8.4): it is very 2012, but i tend to think 2012 was the peak of music so i love that

**Frelock\_** (8): I am a sucker for a good choral background.

**Ionlywanttheworld** (8): I'm thankful for this song introducing me to Foxes

**jsonphile** (8): oh yeah there used to be a time when Zedd didn’t put the ticking clock sound into every song

**ManofOranges** (8): This is for Clarity you big fat annoying EDM sounding song why you took Rather Be off the motherfuckin number one spot with your trifflin nonsense-lyrics ass you big fat song oompa loompa sounding ass song I'm rating up there and I'm gonna beat the fuck out of you bitch and don't even call the rate hosts today cause I'm gonna come up there unexpected and wait on your motherfuckin ass flop I'm coming to beat the fuck out of you flop

**nooodisaster** (8): Me when this song came out: ""Lmao these lyrics are so dumb no one actually feels like this.""  Me now: *i'm in this photo and i don't like it*

**skargardin** (8): bop

**SmileAndTears** (8): The chorus doesn't sound complete? Idk, still a bop

**WeastofEden44** (8): This song is so good but also so dated

**CarlieScion** (7): i hate that this is foxes biggest hit

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (7): Eh. The song is good but I feel like I am the only one who wasn't feeling this song when this was popular.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): The drop of this song is so damn good but the rest of it is kinda empty?

**pat-rickstar** (7): Dated as hell but still kinda slaps (I also need to find a new way to describe songs I like other than ""it slaps"")

**sarcasticsobs** (7): personally been way over zedd for a long long time now but this is still fun

**steelstepladder** (7): A great song from the year of EDM. It's no Don't You Worry Child though

**twat\_brained** (7): ""fuck Notch fuck Musk and I'll piss on Zedd"" - Fraxiom & Gupi, 2020. Foxes is alright tho

# Jess Glynne stans (I will not use the other term)

**CrimsonROSET** (6.5): Rather Be sweetie I'm so sorry.

**cloudbustingmp3** (6): okay this is one of those songs that occasionally HITS but this is not one of those times

**kirby31200** (6): I never really got this one. I think Foxes does an outstanding job but Zedd's production lets her down

**team\_kockroach** (6): This song is very much a mixed bag. Big, arena rock EDM drops have aged poorly, but the first minute of production still sounds great. Foxes’ vocals are great, but the lyrics kinda suck.

**seanderlust** (5.8): stay the night outsold

**fadedblue09** (5.5): Gets a pass because I love Foxes’ voice, but otherwise I’m happy this kind of music is dead.

**TiltControls** (5.5): I like the verses, but the chorus is kind of a mess

**ReallyCreative** (5): this song is SO out of place on this rate... the mediocrity JUMPED out

**selegend** (5): hasnt aged all that well but it’s iconic for sure

**waluigiest** (4): to me..... it’s kinda just dude edm

**bespectacIed** (3): basic but kinda an anthem. It beating Rather Be was a crime

**chillbumps5** (3): the drop ruins the song, like most edm songs

**MoonlightByWindow** (2): WHAT IS THIS LMAOOOOO

**nootnoot781** (2): rather be lost to THIS?????

**Roxieloxie** (2): the rather be/clarity switch up is the reason to this day i have trust issues when it comes to reveals

**bulforster** (1.4): (#46) This is just kind of soulless.

**ElizabethDDoS** (1): This is dreadful all the way through. The only good thing Zedd has ever contributed to is ARTPOP.

**kappyko** (1): I HATE U ZEDD!!!!!!

**moonagenightmares** (1): i actually got a headache listening to this song

**wavingwolves** (0): ah if giving this a 0 could save me from ever hearing it again"

4955,2020-12-24 09:26:30,kjc2si,"I think Yukika's Soul Lady album is cohesive, it retains the same musical style and vibe throughout the album. The intros and outros both have a flight theme too."
4956,2020-12-24 12:47:38,kjc2si,"SHINee’s Misconceptions series back in 2013 were two cohesive albums imo.

Misconceptions of You came first, with the title track Dream Girl. The overall album is bright, upbeat, and really fun — representing what the public sometimes mistakenly sees in SHINee.

Misconceptions of Me came next, with the title Why So Serious. This album contrasts greatly with the first, since it is heavier, maybe a little seductive, and dark. This album is meant to represent the dreams SHINee wanted for themselves and the misconception of ideals (according to LSM in the wiki). 

Jonghyun penned the lyrics to several songs in both albums (as did the other members) — but one is especially key: Spoiler from MoY, which connects the MoY and MoM by containing the song titles from both albums.

The albums are an absolute delight to listen through and contain songs that are my all time favorites even now, 7 years on:

MoY: Dream Girl, Punch Drunk Love, Girls Girls Girls

MoM: Orgel, Excuse Me Miss, Dangerous, Nightmare"
4957,2020-12-24 10:11:22,kjc2si,"fx's Pink Tape is always brought up as a great album; and I really do think it has a lot of cohesiveness - it's similar to Taylor Swift's 1989 in it's cohesiveness. 4 walls by fx would also be considered cohesive in that sense. 

Also; The Red by Red Velvet is so super cohesive. If you listen to the album in one go; every song melds into each other really well and it feels like a very bright and well executed album"
4958,2020-12-24 10:32:32,kjc2si,"NU'EST does this quite a lot actually. Their album Canvas has each song representing a different time of day, and The Table (my personal favourite album) shows the progression of a relationship from start to breakup.

Their most recent album The Nocturne the theme is night so all the songs are related to that in some way (also it's supposed to be good to listen to while driving at night)"
4959,2020-12-24 09:01:37,kjc2si,"I was about to recommend Heng:garae but you’ve already mentioned it so I’m going to recommend its continuation, **Semicolon**.It maintains a similar theme for the journey of youth, while also having a retro style throughout the album, albeit in different genres. 

You start with home;run, a swing song talking about a youth’s journey and how we need to take a break while having fun and swinging with the music. You then have Do Re Mi which tackles the various insecurities of youth and how one can charge forward and make your own path. The next song Hey Buddy that talks of youth’s journey with friends, then Light a Flame and Ah!Love exploring two sides of love. We then end with All My Love, a song of acceptance of our own faults and how we can do better for the future.

I also say **Al1** is a cohesive album. Every single song in that album is about a break up in some form or the other."
4960,2020-12-24 15:53:08,kjc2si,"For me Is anybody out there? by DPR Live, Maria by Hwasa, Cle 1: Miroh by SKZ and Dean's 130:moodtrbl are probably some of the more cohesive albums I have listened to. IAOT by DPR is insanely good in how wonderfully the album flows, the sound and vibe is so similar it feels like a very long story sung or put into music and each section of the story is a song for itself.

Miroh is conceptually cohesive because there is this theme they are basing the album off of and all the songs from intro to the title track and b sides tie together pretty well. Sound wise I won't say it's cohesive, the genres are quite varied, but conceptually, it's a solid album. I'd say even their I am series is pretty cohesive thematically atleast.

DPR Live's IAOT is the album though. It feels so blissful to listen to the album in a go....

Edit: I know DPR and Dean aren't kpop but I thought people should know what a beautiful piece of art IAOT is and because Dean is well... Dean xD"
4961,2020-12-24 09:45:21,kjc2si,"I actually found BTS's BE to be a very cohesive album. 

In terms of sound, it starts off mellow and gets progressively more somber, and then there's a skit where they've received good news and then the songs become brighter and more energetic. 

In terms of lyrics and message, I find it's almost like a story of their time in covid chronologically. It starts with **Life Goes On** which talks about how the world stopped but we keep going, then **Fly to my Room** which is about your room becoming basically your entire world and the sadness but also safety that comes with that. Then **Blue & Grey** talks about feeling depressed without hope and wanting to feel happier. Then the **Skit** comes in and they're celebrating the good news of getting #1 on the BB100. Then as a result we get **Telepathy** which talks about feeling connected to their fans or their loved ones despite the distance. Then as a result of everything going on and working so hard they get to **Dis-ease** which is about them experiencing burnout and feeling jaded with work, and never really being able to turn off your brain. **Stay** shows their unwavering connection to their fans despite the terrible circumstances, and then finally **Dynamite** comes in as a pick me up and cheerful song to end the album on a happy note and to say that we will, in the future, *light it up like dynamite* 🎉🎉🎉. 

Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk."
4962,2020-12-24 09:04:10,kjc2si,"I’m not super musically savvy to correct me if I’m wrong but I think Dreamcatcher often has very cohesive albums. Their 2 most recent ones(since i am most familiar with them), Dystopia:Tree of Language and Dystopia:Lose Myself felt like there was a common vibe running through each album and the songs flowed well from one to another. Their intros also segued into their respective title tracks super well. 

A big reason for why their albums tend to be more cohesive is because all/basically all of their music is created by LEEZ and Ollounder, so it’s much easier for them to have cohesive albums. While im not as familiar with Ateez’s music, they also happen to use LEEZ and Ollounder for much of their music, so I would assume they’d have some pretty cohesive works as well"
4963,2020-12-24 14:03:14,kjc2si,"Mamamoo's 'Travel' album. They have chill bops with Travel, Chuck, and Diamond and the right amount of burst with Aya and Dingga then wraps up with a quiet 'Good night'."
4964,2020-12-24 16:53:12,kjc2si,Mamamoo’s Blue:s album is very cohesive imo. There’s the main theme of breakups and what happens after a breakup. Musically wise the tracks might be a bit different from each other even tho I’m not too informed about this but they all still carry the same theme.
4965,2020-12-24 20:05:33,kjc2si,"From my personal preferences, that would be Taeyeon's debut album **I**.

The tracks are arrange in which it tells a sad love story. The first one on the list would be the title track **I** in which it talks about finding yourself or loving yourself. If we will fall in love to someone, we have to love ourselves first since we are giving a part of our life to someone. The next one is the song **UR** in which it talks about expressing the love for your ""the one"" in your life. There are times that relationships doesn't go well and the song **Gemini** describes that feeling in which the person still reminisces the good and bad times that happened in their relationship. There is still this feeling of hope in this relationship, but the more you think about it, it's impossible and I think that is the message of the song in general. The next song would be **Stress** in which you are still in a process of recovering and you are stress because of that and this is the time you realized how fool you are as a person. The last song will be **Farewell** in which you are literally moving forward and not looking back at the past, but in the lines of the song, you will be a fool before you look forward just to compensate the feelings that you have in which it's indeed sad since you prove to yourself that you lost the game.

This is how I think of a cohesive album. Thanks!!!"

4967,2020-12-24 10:00:30,kjc2si,"I don’t listen to that much albums fully, but Square Up? I know it’s a mini album, but I like the progression of the story:

1. **Ddu-Du-Ddu-Du** - An introduction song where you shouldn’t take the girls for granted just because they’re pretty. What I like about the meaning of the song is that it can be interpreted in two way. Whether they’re warning the lover not to take them granted once they start dating, or basically a flex song lol

2. **Forever Young** - Say that we’re going for the former interpretation, they’re starting the relationship off nice and sweet. No worries there.

3. **Really** - The lover starts taking interested in other girls, and of course the song is about questioning where his heart lies since he’s not showing as much as love as the person wants to.

4. **See U Later** - The song close off as an upbeat goodbye song, noting that the lover wasn’t worth their time anyway."
4968,2020-12-24 19:30:52,kjc2si,This one is a masterpiece.
4969,2020-12-24 14:14:22,kjc2si,Seconding Misconceptions and adding on Jonghyun's She Is album.  It's the story of meeting someone and falling in love.  The album takes you through the relationship.  It's an amazing album and it flows incredibly well.

From melancholic tracks - transitionining via the skit - then to the bright songs - ending it with ""Light it up like Dynamite"". 

With the theme of ""Life Goes On"", this kind of progression in a song is so fitting. Just like Life - It might be melancholic now, but it will eventually get better. And, we'll light it up like dynamite woaaah ☺"
4973,2020-12-24 12:10:13,kjc2si,It’s always so cathartic listening to the whole album and ending with Dynamite. It allows me to imagine things actually being better soon.
4974,2020-12-24 13:51:10,kjc2si,"I love BE, I feel like it's monumental for the group (and I cherish it sm, it's my first album!) but I felt like it could work some more tracks before Stay and Dynamite? I am not sure how others found it but the clubby vibe of Stay seems disorienting after the general mood of the previous tracks. Not that it doesn't belong there, I just wished they had worked the album to full-length because that's how good the sound of BE was working and I felt like there was more to the sound that was worth exploring than what was contained in the 8 tracks. I felt like the sudden switch to party songs put the chillness away but without proper transition. Sometimes I'd end up skipping Stay and Dynamite and loop just LGO to Telepathy instead. I do agree it's quite cohesive for a BTS album."
4975,2020-12-24 09:47:32,kjc2si,"Came here to make a similar comment! Both artists have such unique sonic trademarks, and I think they benefit a lot from working with a set producing team. I’ve listened to some of Dystopia:Tree of Language, and they cover a good range without losing their signature feel - the switch from Black or White to Jazz Bar is surprisingly seamless. 

Ateez’s second EP, Zero to One, has always felt the most cohesive and full to me, though the songs themselves are much less similar to each other than in their other EPs. I think the type of cohesiveness in ep.2 is more, this-album-feels-like-a-journey, whereas Ep.1 and Ep.3 are more these-albums’-tracks-compliment-each-other-really-well-and-lead-into-each-other-smoothly cohesiveness."

4977,2020-12-24 15:12:54,kjc2si,Piggybacking this to say that An Ode is one of their most cohesive albums as well(imo)
4978,2020-12-24 21:17:25,kjc2si,"Wait I didn't get, I dean korean?"
4979,2020-12-24 21:51:07,kjc2si,"I mean, Dean is an R&B artist in SK and the people doesn't consider him as an idol since he doesn't promote in that way. BTW, he is also the one who produces his songs and he will have an album I guess... but he wants to target America with that one... so IDK what will happen."

4989,2020-12-24 13:06:13,kj3q2k,"100% agree, it’s a shame, don’t understand how people can’t vote someone who clearly looks better in that outfit just because of their skin colour. Also agree with your take on Margot, probably one of the most attractive women in the world but the suit and tie look really doesn’t suit her"
4990,2020-12-24 20:11:43,kj3q2k,"That's not really the point I'm making. I find it weird that Margots winning this given that imo, she looks the worst out of all of them in a suit. Meanwhile Janelle gets like a dozen votes even though her whole aesthetic was wearing suits for years. It's not that you would turn down janelle in a vacuum, hopefully no one in their right mind would 😅, but it's that most people here would turn her down for Margot, even though Janelle's slaying tf out of her suit, and Margot is most definitely not wearing it well."
4991,2020-12-24 16:42:49,kj3q2k,"Reddits mostly white, so unless you're on a sub specifically dedicated to people of colour, or a specific celebrity of colour, they're not gonna get much appreciation. I don't think it's racism, but people here are just more familiar with names like Scarlett and Margot so they automatically vote for them regardless of the pictured presented, which is against the spirit of the sub, but that's what it's become."
4992,2020-12-24 17:11:56,kj3q2k,"Yeah that’s a good point, always confused me how people like Janelle, Thandie Newton, Nicki Minaj, Hannah John-Kamen etc etc would lose battles they clearly should’ve won. Someone should make a POC version of this haha"

5003,2020-12-20 14:39:38,kgknau,That suit is way too tight.
5004,2020-12-20 02:33:17,kgknau,I'd just love to have her alterations specialist on speed dial. Sigh.
5005,2020-12-20 00:52:09,kgiw16,"I wish the pants were 1-2""  shorter so you could see a tiny bit of her shoes/feet.  But I agree, I love Janelle's style! <3.
