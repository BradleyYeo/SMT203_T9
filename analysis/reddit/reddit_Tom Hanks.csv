13,2020-02-04 22:44:40,eyydgl,They do! They’re great friends and for years have scheduled their colonoscopies for the same day each year and prepped for them together the night before playing cards or some other pastime. It’s in Martin Short’s autobiography!

But you guys and Tom Hanks, and one other friend, you get together every other year for a colonoscopy party,” Kimmel asked Martin and Short during their appearance on Jimmy Kimmel.

>“Yes there’s the Christmas party, and there’s the colonoscopy party. That is true,” Martin, 72, confirmed. “Because we thought, everybody at our age — not your audience, it’s certainly not anyone here in this studio — but at a certain age you want to get a colonoscopy, I think it’s after 50.”

These are the types of friends I aim to have at 50"

Personally, I would not attack the accent until and unless you know you can exist in the scenes as that person. Some people slap on an accent and call it a character - but since you are in a college program you have the resources to go beyond that.

As for age - maybe Carl is a mature and very settled 31. Don't feel like you have to reach that far in age, but what you have to bring is the temperament of order and experience and determination of a dog that will not give up a bone. The key is that you are bringing something on that stage that is real and you can play. Don't end up impersonating an old person. In that role we want to see grappling with conflict and growth in the second act. Still, to Frank he seems a million years old."

But they kept coming, so I gave it a listen and, while it took a while for me to immerse myself in pure pop, Emotion has come to be one of my fave albums of *all* time.

You heard it. Carly, and you guys, really did *that*."

# TAKE ME TO THE FEELING!"
89,2020-01-31 06:03:42,ewjh4x,"God bless this album and this sub

1. Given how poptimism seemed to take on a life of its own after this album came out, it's hard to say how this album would do if it came out in the present day. The mainstream pop scene still hasn't really reverted back to this sound, so I doubt its sales would be much better, but I can only imagine the critical reception would be a lot more instantaneous. I think the album came out at the perfect time, to be honest, almost as a swan song for the style of 80s-inspired pop that was actually a mainstream presence in 2015.

2. Warm Blood and When I Needed You would slot in perfectly on Dedicated, given how they're a bit more funk/disco influenced as opposed to the new wave stylings of the rest of the album (being at the end of the track listing makes them a great bridge for Dedicated too) On the flip side, I always thought Now That I Found You actually would have fit a whole lot better onto Emotion than Dedicated, since it's aesthetically way more similar. Real Love would have fit nicely too with its more modern pop structure

3. I absolutely ADORE Your Type. It's still my favourite Carly song, and I thought it was a generally accepted fan favourite but she's taken it off most of her setlists now so I didn't get to see her do it live, so I guess it's back to being an underrated track now lol

4. I'll come back and edit this with a picture of my vinyl. That record is probably in my top 5 most played on my setup

Edit: [Don't call me a fake pophead ever again](https://imgur.com/a/PNacYeu)"
90,2020-01-31 05:46:40,ewjh4x,i'm not even a fan of hers and i've seen her in concert TWICE.... /r/popheads influence and power
91,2020-01-31 06:18:48,ewjh4x,its just such a loaded album and it has aged very well. i don't think i listened to it until after i read the pitchfork review (used to check the site daily) and i remember just being blown away.
92,2020-01-31 09:06:17,ewjh4x,"I remember living in Seoul, Korea at the time the album got released. I must’ve walked around for 1,5 hours on a snowy cold night wearing my Chucks looking for a store that sold this record. Luckily, I found it!"
93,2020-01-31 06:30:37,ewjh4x,"Hey just as a quick heads up, loved this review, if we meet you're welcome to do anything to me.

Anyways, I don't think that this album would do much better than it did if it came out today. I think it would still manage to find a cult following but if it couldn't make a big impact in 2015, when pop music in this style was even more in fashion, I can't imagine it would do much better today. Plus (pitchforks out guys) I do think the album has aged in the way that a lot of pop albums do, even the great ones. So commercially, no. 

Critically? It's hard to say. It's really hard to say with critics because so much of our opinions of things is based off of narrative, and *Emotions* release seeded the poptimist narrative for a lot of pop albums that followed it so it's hard to judge how *Emotion* would be treated because it feels like we'd have to measure it against itself. Plus I feel like I've seen a lot of great pop albums come out in the last few years that were completely shafted by critics and the public so it could totally happen to this one still. Personally I think it would get to like, 80-85% Metacritic, which is pretty good.

As for underrated songs on the album, I've seen a LOT of people slander ""L.A. Hallucinations"" which is blasphemy because it's one of the strongest tracks. It has the most distinct sonic palate, it's one of the most experimental, and one of the most interesting thematically. Plus the weird near-sprechstimme chorus is wonderfully catchy. 

""Gimme Love"" is another favorite of mine that I feel like (maybe) gets overlooked. ""Favorite Color"" is my favorite to sing along to, might go do that right now."
94,2020-01-31 10:42:07,ewjh4x,"This album not gaining all the recognition it deserves is the biggest injustice of the decade.
Pop music needs to be more valued, honestly."
95,2020-01-31 07:36:20,ewjh4x,"> How well do you think an album like this fare if it were released today, both critically and commercially?

Critically, let's pretend *Dedicated* was released before this one. *EMOTION* might get a fraction of the acclaim because with ""I Really Like You"", the critics would pounce on her for trying to ""sell out"" or recapture the glory of ""Call Me Maybe"" or read her for not making another ""Julien"" or whatever *Dedicated* track the gays that live for her insist should've smashed. Basically, be thankful this came before *Dedicated*. [Commercially, give you 3 guesses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAFZnvTfFAs).

If anyone was gonna cap this series, I'm glad it was you and an album that birthed this corner of Reddit."
96,2020-01-31 12:59:19,ewjh4x,"One thing I realized a few months ago. The critics main problem with E•MO•TION was that it didn’t tell us much about Carly the person. I’m starting to think she did this deliberately to tell us something about longing and unrequited love. 

Look at this line from When I Needed You , the last song on the standard album:

>I don’t know what you wanted  
I tried to be so perfect  
I thought that it was worth it  
To let myself just disappear"
97,2020-01-31 05:57:30,ewjh4x,Plenty of songs off this album still impress me after dozens of listens. Aside from a few fillerish tracks this album deserves the r/popheads praise.
98,2020-01-31 09:16:44,ewjh4x,"Great review! I couldn’t avoid hearing I Really Like You everywhere when it came out but I never listened to the album until like a month ago and oh boy.. I was so pissed at myself for how much I’ve been missing but at the same time happy I have some new enjoyable music.

Run Away With Me and I Really Like You are most likely my very favorites from the album but they’re all great. I guess I can say I don’t really care for any of the songs coming after LA Hallucinations but 10 songs are enough of an album anyway.

Side B is amazing too I believe but I only listened to it once so I don’t really have any specific opinions about it."
99,2020-01-31 09:26:24,ewjh4x,"First of all, thank you very much for including my end of year write up in this retrospection, it was a really delightful surprise. Emotion as an album has such an interesting place in my heart, as it helped me evolved quite a lot as a human being in many different facets, and it's one I have to thank a lot for 

As for the questions

1. I don't think Emotion would fare any better if it's released now, but not for the reason most might think. To me, Emotion was the catalyst that pushed poptimism into the mainstream, without the album, I sincerely doubt that the current music landscape that we're inhabiting would happen. 

2. I don't really see any tracks being interchangable on both albums, they're very distinct beings, even if the soundscapes that they inhabit are in close proximity to one another. The closest I can say is No Drug Like Me, but that's about it from my viewpoint

3. I Didn't Just Come Here To Dance. I'm so shocked that for a supposed disco track, it doesn't get more love anywhere. It's just pure joy and filled with life in a way that's very of its own but still flows with the album. 

4. Sadly no, although I plan to remedy this someday once I have a more stable financial situation and can invest in vinyls"
100,2020-01-31 16:29:25,ewjh4x,this album changed my life for the better tbh
101,2020-01-31 10:26:02,ewjh4x,"1. I'm sure I don't know
2. I don't think so.  They have quite different sonic 'palettes'
3. ""When I Needed You"" and ""Boy Problems"" should be recognised as champions
4. Of COURSE I did  [https://imgur.com/a/ybLpITV](https://imgur.com/a/ybLpITV)"
102,2020-01-31 08:16:41,ewjh4x,"3. I only properly discovered this album at the beginning of 2019 – in time for the queen herself to finally come to Australia, which was great – and found myself connecting with different songs more over the course of the year as I had different experiences. That being said, tracks that have consistently stood out to me are Boy Problems, I Didn't Just Come Here to Dance (see my username haha), Making the Most of the Night and Let's Get Lost, so the particularly effervescent ones I suppose?

Edit: also, great writeup! Really thorough and nuanced"
103,2020-01-31 14:51:56,ewjh4x,THE album of the decade
104,2020-01-31 05:29:44,ewjh4x,31?! There were most definitely not 30 albums better than this during the decade.
105,2020-01-31 17:21:29,ewjh4x,"I don't see how All That was critic bait? Dev Hynes is superrrr underrated and from what I gathered in her interviews someone she had been wanting to work with for quite sometime. It's one of the first songs in the album that I immediately gravitated towards and damn if her voice fits the production perfectly, I would even go as far and say it's god-tier in her discography."
106,2020-01-31 18:38:56,ewjh4x,"1. Probably no different commercially. A 77 feels way low in my opinion. I'm not sure critical reception would be different, but it SHOULD. 

2. Dedicated feels a bit more like a mishmash of styles, and I think if virtually any song from EMOTION was on there from the start it would fit. But from Dedicated, I think Happy Not Knowing could easily work on EMOTION. NTIFY and NDLM too. 

3. Warm Blood and When I Needed You. 

4. I bought it on iTunes. I bought the Target cd. I bought 3 LPs and then a fourth one when an autographed version popped up in her merch store."
107,2020-02-01 02:29:39,ewjh4x,"1. I have no idea how it would do commercially but I think it would have gotten more critical praise.

2. IDK I haven't listened to dedicated

3. I think favorite color severely underrated

4. I can't buy it in my shithole country

Also unrelated but today I learned that the pre-chorus of ""I don't just come her to dance"" says ""it's you boy in the corner"" instead of ""it's you boy unicorn""."
108,2020-01-31 11:38:00,ewjh4x,I got into this album WAY too late. Didn't give it a chance because so many people were hyping it and I didn't want to be disappointed. I was so wrong.
109,2020-01-31 14:02:30,ewjh4x,"1. I feel like it’s difficult to imagine an album like this being released today considering the impact this had on how critics consume pop music nowadays. It’d definitely have been in more top tens from publications, that’s for sure.

2. “Real Love” could have been a bonus track, as could have maybe “Feels Right.” “Favourite Colour” could be on *Dedicated*.

3. “Let’s Get Lost” is *clearly* top three if not the best song on the album! That saxophone, this whole thing basically being a more awestruck “Run Away with Me”.... brilliant!

4. no

and this is the best explanation of the inception of popheads yet and your prose is amazing thanks for this!"
110,2020-01-31 14:58:19,ewjh4x,">How well do you think an album like this fare if it were released today, both critically and commercially? Keep in mind that it has a 77 on Metacritic, which is one point lower than Camila Cabello’s debut.

I feel like it would be about the same critically. ~77 feels deserved. Commercially, I feel like there's maybe more space on the horizon for it, but I also like to think this album influenced the music that came after it, so idk. 

>Do you think any songs from Dedicated would fit on this album? What about the other way around?

I feel like Party for One would fit sonically but not necessarily lyrically. Otherwise, Feels Right could've fit imo. 

>What do you think is the most underrated track? The singles and the title track get a lot of praise, but what other song do you wish got more love?

Tbh either I Didn't Just Come Here to Dance or Emotion. Both of these tracks are brilliant and yet when I see people rate the tracks on this album or give this album the EP treatment, both are consistently left out. IDJCHtD is a total bop and Emotion is the perfect compliment to RAWM~~e.~~ I'm not sure where all the praise is for the title track, OP, but I Would Like To See It. 

>Be honest — did you actually buy this album? Please post proof.

No. But I keep telling myself I'll buy the albums I love (Dirty Computer, Sweetener, thank u, next, MAGDALENE, Sir, etc.) and own a record player now. Not much longer now."
111,2020-01-31 17:15:08,ewjh4x,Seeing her next Saturday and cannot wait to dance to these bops!
112,2020-01-31 22:54:50,ewjh4x,"I think it would be rated better in 2020. Critics seem to have realized there’s substance in pop.It’s a once-in-a-lifetime album. I enjoy it because it doesn’t sound like anything else. After checking the UK singles run, it’s no surprise it did better there. (it reminds me Xenomania at their peak.)"
113,2020-01-31 15:20:02,ewjh4x,"Agree with everything you said except When I Needed You, IMO that’s one of the most brash 80s-sounding songs on the album. Agreed about Real Love being Emotion-ish, and I think maybe Fever would fit the most on Dedicated"
114,2020-01-31 14:32:30,ewjh4x,How can you have experienced her presence TWICE and still not be a fan of hers? It don’t make no sense
115,2020-01-31 12:55:11,ewjh4x,Where did you see her? I want to know if I accidentally met Josually 😂
116,2020-01-31 13:58:32,ewjh4x,I'm an absolute fanboy and have been since this album dropped and haven't seen her once. :(
117,2020-01-31 07:57:43,ewjh4x,Gimme Love and I Didn't Just Come Here To Dance are both severely underrated
118,2020-01-31 20:42:22,ewjh4x,"Honestly, I feel that LA Hallucinations was put there to help this album get a Grammy nod. It doesn’t really fit with the rest of the album thematically. 

This song would have been a good follow up to Call Me Maybe after Carly became famous for a stint, but it doesn’t feel right on E•MO•TION (because it’s the only song I can’t relate to 😂)"
119,2020-01-31 06:38:24,ewjh4x,"> Aside from a few fillerish tracks

which ones :eyes:"
120,2020-01-31 09:55:44,ewjh4x,Black Heart is **one** track.

127,2020-01-31 05:56:44,ewjh4x,"Yeah, and we had to close it out with a bang. Or a banger (is that still a term ppl use?)"
128,2020-01-31 20:11:05,ewjh4x,Oh you're not a stan fan?
129,2020-01-31 19:24:57,ewjh4x,I flew to LA for the opening show and seriously contemplated taking a bus to SF to see her during pride the next day. I should have.
130,2020-01-31 14:52:23,ewjh4x,it's a 7 in an album full of 9s and 10s
131,2020-01-31 13:40:23,ewjh4x,"I still regularly refer to songs as bangers :-(((( 


Three possible categories a song may fall under for me, but not exclusively limited to these three, are: bangers, bop, and slaps. For the order of how good a song is: it’s a banger > it slaps > a bop"

254,2020-01-29 23:29:37,evum1e,"OK, I fervently pray there will never be a TV Silmarillion, but as this is all hypothetical...

Regardless of whom you get, I think you'd have to actually show Eru, as sometimes he does important things without speaking.

A CGI Melkor would be cheesy; someone would need to play him. The fact that ""it would be hard to have someone play him in person"" is illustrative of the problems involved in making something like the Silmarillion for TV.

I'd go for Cumberbatch as Feanor. The rest of those noms kinda make my brain seize up, especially Tom Hanks as Manwe and Beyonce as Varda. Just... wow, no.

A younger Sean Bean would have been an ideal Turin. I doubt the budget would include time travel, though.

Even if you got the best possible cast, it wouldn't guarantee a good result. Anybody but me remember that the first Clash of the Titans featured Laurence Olivier, Maggie Smith, Claire Bloom and Burgess Meredith?"

Follow the white rabbit..."
265,2020-03-28 18:26:56,fqmsay,"It might be a more simple answer. 

Adrenochrome is made at the same lab as coronavirus? Whoever works with adrenochrome most likely was exposed to coronavirus which would potentially then spread to those distributing the adrenochdome, and then spread to the users aka the celebrities, politicians, etc. 

Might be more likely than some sort of targeted move to adrenchrome users. Just my 2 cents"

Don't know what you can make of it guys but I'll leave it here. It's about the upcoming exposing of the deep state. He is talking about a reset of the system but stays open about where it's heading. A location of the Wuhan adrenochrome lab is also there.

EDIT: Especially he mentioned the release of Europe from the deep state and pedophiles by the allies."

This is bad logic. It's not specifically fear of the virus that would produce adrenochrome, it would be any fear at all.

Also, if the target is the ""adrenochrome addicted"" then the cumulative fear overcome would be the measure, not 2 weeks of virus news reports."

282,2020-03-28 22:35:41,fqmsay,US has been doing constant lies in mainstream media to reduce panic and increase rule following.  If that debra bitch says one more time that we don't know how many cases there are I'm going to throw something at the TV.  This shit can be figured out with 10th grade math.
283,2020-03-28 17:09:02,fqmsay,"Because of the movie fear and loathing everyone seems to automatically go to adrenochrome. 

But I think the perspective of the movie Limitless is probably more accurate. Any substance the body makes the bio chemist can make synthetically."

292,2020-03-28 16:20:03,fqmsay,That theory certainly can be compatible with this one.
293,2020-03-28 19:16:33,fqmsay,"Magnetobiology (suppressed science) studies show that 6oGHz 5G causes oxygen to not combine well with blood hemoglobin, causing the body to become oxygen starved.  The cornavirus also has the same effect in the lungs.  Combining the two would be much deadlier.

Wuhan was one of the [pilot cities](http://en.hubei.gov.cn/news/newslist/201804/t20180416_1275769.shtml) for 5G.  Coincidence?

You win dummest comment of the day award.

There are millions of “free thinkers” in the world, it’s not about this community specifically. Also, why you’re here I don’t even understand, you’re clearly not a “free thinker”, nor do you have logic and reasoning, if you did, your understand that “dark forces” as you put them have existed for a very very long time. Secret societies like the “skull and bones” is not a conspiracy, look up how many presidents were part of this “dark force”, one with logic and reasoning will see that there are more “coincidences” than naturally possible. Look up the families that have passed down wealth and information for thousands of years. 

Look at it this way, imagine being rich, I’m not talking a million dollars “rich”, I’m talking hundreds of billions of dollars, would you not get together with your other rich pals and try to implement your own vision (bilderberg group), and many more.

You’re quite uninformed, and quick to judge, I’m going to guess you’re very young and have no life experience, your parents have raised you to think you’re right all the time, and reality will soon bite you in the ass. Good luck pal."

305,2020-03-29 00:45:37,fqmsay,"While this might be true. All electromagnetic radiation can be harmful to humans, not only 5g. 5g is just extremely dangerous because it affects up to 95% oxygen near it. Your phone is like a magnet and has tons of electromagnetic energy around it. I encourage you to check out 5g and the effects. It's extremely dangerous for mankind.  


4g is also dangerous but by far less. 5g is not for humans, it's actually for AI/machines. 5g is a military weapon, there's a US military doc talking about it."

But the smaller symptoms that precede these, which are sometimes the only symptoms, go unreported.   
If you examine our testing criteria; well, did you wonder why the media say ""most of our cases are from overseas"".   
It's because you must have recently traveled or been in contact with a confirmed positive to actually BE tested.   
If you show with a fever, they will reject testing unless you can show you had contact with a positive.    
The test data is skewed and the virus from the onset has been characterised by its worst symptoms = people turning up to hospitals absolutely wrecked.   
The consequence is that we are ignoring the preceding symptoms that can help us stop this (its going to fuck us). 

I've read symptoms such as itchy nose and sinuses for a week, that progress into a throat itch, then sudden fever, full relapse, and then further fever and positive diagnosis.   
Loss of taste, headaches and muscle aches, light cough no fever, then a positive diagnosis.   
I've had very similar symptoms that you've mentioned, but at this point both of us just have to assume we are positive because we can't rely on our government to test us to confirm.     
Do as I do , self isolate and wait. Tolerate the symptoms and if you come down with a fever and are struggling to breathe, at that point maybe we'll actually be tested."

And these are very very serious claims indeed.

Once he is unable to give any evidence (not even ordinary evidence), just tell him ""no, it's not Oprah, it's Cthulhu"". And tell him you have the same amount of evidence for Cthulhu as he has for Oprah.

Case closed.

EDIT: Feelings are not evidence. Beliefs are not evidence. ""Evidence"" is evidence. Ask him to show the evidence.

Q is literally just some random asshole on 8chan LARPing as some kind of high-level intelligence expert. Think about your dad being “knowledgeable” on the topic really means. All he’s doing is regurgitating bullshit, so of course he’s more familiar with that bullshit than you are.

From what I’ve read about people in these fucked up online cults, the only way you can maybe get through to them is by gently asking questions until they start seeing the contradictions for themselves. I’ve never tried this with my mom, as she shuts down the instant the topic is brought up, and I’ve decided it’s not worth my time or energy anymore.

There’s a lot of stuff online debunking specifics of the QAnon thing, but the wingnuts fling so much shit at the wall every day that it’s hard to keep up. It’s actually pretty funny how this conspiracy theory ties together almost every other prominent conspiracy theory ever, Pepe Silvia style. You’ve got the Rothschilds, the anti-Semitism, the NWO, the Clintons, the “Hollywood elite,” even fucking JFK Jr!"
377,2020-03-28 03:24:08,fq754q,"r/Qult_Headquarters is a good resource.

The biggest contradiction is that Q is still alive.  How many people really have access to the information he has?  He has provided pictures of his pen and watch online.  He has been leaking very specific information.  These are people supposedly smart enough to control the entire world, how could they have not caught him from the extremely narrow pool of people in question?

The other big contradiction is why he is providing this information.  If he has to provide so much ""disinformation"", what is the point of telling anyone anything when he is actively tipping off the people he is trying to catch what is about to happen to him?  And when people on the internet decode his communication, why are they posting it publicly for these villains to see?

The final issue is that someone has been caught on video with the QAnon account open, someone who most definitely does not have the access QAnon supposedly has."
378,2020-03-28 00:46:42,fq754q,"Ask him what the natural conclusion should be.
If Q is right and there’s a huge pedophile ring that’s in cahoots with the government and Hollywood, what’s the right thing to do?

Even at a basic level , the right thing is to not watch any or tv or movies. Listen to music? Nope. Can’t do that anymore.

Any good, moral person would dedicate their lives to stopping this shit, right? Can you imagine if you found out there was pedophile ring? I would die trying to stop that shit. Would your dad?

Basically, if he really believes it, why is he not acting on it. If this is true, he’s not taking this seriously. He needs to piss of get off the pot.

My guess is that when push comes to shove, he doesn’t really buy this shit deep down."
379,2020-03-28 07:44:02,fq754q,"This shit definitely seems like a cult.

A pretty good friend of mine has got into this and he's changed as a person honestly.

He kept sending me conspiracy stuff, trying to tell me to look into all these various conspiracies that are way the fuck out there.

I kept telling him I didn't really care about it but he kept sending it. Eventually I asked him if he really believes in this Qanon stuff what is he doing in real life to prevent it or prepare for it instead of just sharing videos. This seemed to piss him off and he told me I need to be a ""critical thinker and open up my eyes""..

He seemed to think he was doing me a great favor of sharing this information with me and trying to open my eyes to what is going to come in this great global shift. 

All in all man it has ruined our friendship. He has decided that he doesn't want to speak to me and would rather speak to his other friends who he has opened them up to this Qanon shit.

These people are fucking quack jobs. It makes you paranoid, it ruins your relationships with people who don't think the same way as you, it's just all fucking weird as hell. Weird times we live in man and I feel this coronavirus has just made them go 10x harder on this.

I can't really offer you much advice but I understand where you're coming from."
380,2020-03-28 08:08:42,fq754q,"There are a lot of good debunkings out there, but two things stood out for me.

First, there is no such thing as Q clearance. It just doesn't exist in the intelligence community. There is speculation that it came from an episode of Archer ([season 6 episode 7](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4389452/?ref_=ttep_ep7)) in which Archer infiltrates area 51 while claiming to have 'Q clearance' from the CIA. Interestingly, that episode aired in syndication just one week before the first Q drop.

Second, 'Q' doesn't seem to know, well anything, about real intelligence operations. He initially used 4Chan [tripcodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imageboard#Tripcodes) as validation, but the tripcodes can be hacked (and, in fact, probably happened). Why did he not use digital signatures (public key encryption) to validate his posts? This is basic knowledge that every intelligence officer should have, and it's relatively simple to implement. But Q didn't seem to know anything about it."
381,2020-03-28 11:22:50,fq754q,"When I look at qanon, they are like white nationalist nazi christians basically, pulling on other pedo christians chains.. Just like the (R) in which their politicians get in trouble with child porn.. This why I wish we could do surprise checkups on their computers/homes, instead of drug checks, to see if they are worthy to be a politician, to check EVERYONE. If its one thing I find, is religion tends to breed these kind people, when they are raised with it.

By the way how christian like are you guys? Is there any subtle racism from him?? I'm sure your not the type to share, just wondering if brave enough or if nothing is there happening, I'm not bashing, its just that, its real easy to connect the dots with people and their behaviors.

 also does he complain about the jews that control reddit? /s jkjk..."

400,2020-03-27 20:16:36,fq3xbj,"Answer: Tom Hanks is one of those most famous actors in Hollywood and there’s a conspiracy theory that he’s a pedophile because according to some folks, mostly QAnon people, everyone in Hollywood is a pedophile.

He’s currently in self-quarantine because him and his wife have Covid-19, however, QAnon people think he’s actually under arrest and in jail. This feeds into a larger narrative that current president (and friend of convicted pedophile rapist Jeffrey Epstein) Donald Trump is going to mass arrest Hollywood pedophiles on Easter."

i saw someone on IG refer to this and went to check it for myself. Woody was voiced by Tom Hanks, looks like he is laying near a ""tunnel"" or private bunker

CGI Bullet casings being disscjarged from the gun and then vanishing in mid air.

I did it before too when I really wanted to put up a picture that proved I went somewhere and I didn't want my work to know I actually went there so I set the location tag to another city.

Could they be saying something by using that tag specifically, like a coded message?  Could be.  But when it comes to tagging locations, instagram doesn't force you to use your actual location."

567,2020-04-21 04:19:56,g4y5om,"I think it's an attempt to paint a picture of conspiracy theory lunatics everywhere, a proof of the influence and widespread of dangerous false information, where any innocent picture posted by a celebrity gets torn apart in the comment section. That's the reason the Google and Twitter ban on adrenochrome and the psy-op Q was lifted in the first place

This, the 5G tower destructions, the nationwide staged protests, etc. will warrant draconian internet control for the safety of the people. My guess is that after corona we can say goodbye to anonymity on the internet and will be held liable for every comment we post. Not only by the government but also by our peers. Or would you still go around theorizing about Bill Gates wanting to depopulate the planet through a vaccine, if your friends, family, colleagues, boss, teacher, etc. will know what you think? I certainly will not. I can't. Because I work for the government, I would be fired instantly.

They seem to want large civil unrests inspired by the internet happening. Thus my prediction is that the MSM will suddenly switch to massively focus on it soon. Then a few false flag events with deaths will happen. Then a large internet blackout, at least of social media, and when it will be switched back on, anonymity gone."
568,2020-04-20 22:08:45,g4y5om,I think celebrities of all people understand the consequences of making stuff like this public. The amount of harassment toms probably getting right now from people online who believe he’s a pedo or whatever must be intense. Maybe he deserves it I hope not either way I doubt it’s a joke

571,2020-04-21 14:48:48,g4y5om,They obviously lost their communication channels or they wouldn't be doing this.  Hanx is probably picking up kid's gloves in a maximum security prison right now and his friends have no idea where he is.

Brainwashed and who knows what else.  I'm not familiar with her background but just her role in Interview with a Vampire as a child is enough for me to give her a second look.  Same as Drew Barrymore who had some strange tweets a few weeks ago.

And it's not just Woody.  Look at ALL the details in that pic."
579,2020-04-21 15:42:20,g4y5om,yup.  and Oprah had a instagram or tweet video last week showing a similar box on her leg under her pants.

Tom Hanks is theorized to be a top player in this game and they lost touch with him and are scared about their fates.  

Keep in mind when CERN was turned back on in 2009...guess who flipped the switch?  Not a Nobel prize winner or anything.  Tom Hanks did.  Now go look at CERN's logo, the statue out front that was ""donated"" to them, and the ""prank video"" that showed a satanic ceremony of some sort.

The tl;dr is this:

At the Golden Globes, Tom Hanks made references to 3/11, multiple references to 'gates', being sick, and going to Australia.

The coronavirus pandemic was declared on 3/11, while Hanks was in Australia, where he apparently got sick, and now we are told that somebody is going to develop a vaccine to save us...

People hide in the ground from these rocks. The location of this place where this happens has characteristics identical to America. This place is hated by the antichrist. It brings in all goods by sea on ships and buys these goods. It is the greatest consumer on the planet that is supplied by ships. 

All of this combined at least to me would be yellowstone which is probably the bottomless pit. 

Revelation 9:2 King James Version (KJV)

2 And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit

Revelation 17:8 King James Version (KJV)

8 The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.

Revelation 17:16-18 King James Version (KJV)

16 And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.

17 For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.

18 And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which reigneth over the kings

And when he ascends or comes to power out of this event thats when hes in control of the nwo. When Babylon which is not his kingdom is destroyed this is how. 

Revelation 18:11 King James Version (KJV)

11 And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her; for no man buyeth their merchandise any more:

Revelation 18:17-18 King James Version (KJV)

17 For in one hour so great riches is come to nought. And every shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and sailors, and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off,

18 And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What city is like unto this great city!"

Weird. 

It can’t be nothing dude since no one knows for sure. Do I believe it? No. I don’t think it’s anything, nothing’s lead me to believe there is code behind it. Related theams happen daily. 

But, it could be something because like I said there is NO PROOF of it being related to anything actually happening it’s all speculation. 

It hasn’t been proven right, so I don’t care to believe it. 

It hasn’t been proven wrong, so it’s not nothing. Yet.

If being someone who wants the REAL TRUTH and if asking questions and probing people makes me a shill. Then I guess this thread is officially fucking dead.

Not even a year ago, in subreddit like this and UFO/Paranormal... people would poke, probe and ask questions. The only ones who got mad it were what you all call people EVERYDAY now. Shills and just simply undeserved bat shit crazy people who refuse to acknowledge facts that are real. Just because someone wants more answers to believe a crack head idea, doesn’t make them a shill. I’d argue the ones like myself thinking for themselves and asking questions and doing research are the ones being shilled by the people like you OP. 

I believe that."

laying on a white hankerchief with triangles - hanky is a ""map"" code to these people

upside down green truck - someone flipped.  Hillary's SS code name is Evergreen but that's a stretch.

The bowl on top of that box - best I can think of is symbolizing something underground?  A lot of these people fled to new zealand and there are a lot of bunkers there that elites have built (google it)

the blocks in the back...no clue.  Q is there though.

And after seeing the bigger hi res pic, look above the blocks.  Doesn't that look like one of the hospital ships parked here last week?

> The idea does not necessarily imply that there is no objective truth; rather that our access to it is mediated through our senses, experience, conditioning, prior beliefs, and other non-objective factors. The implied individual world each person occupies is said to be their reality tunnel. The term can also apply to groups of people united by beliefs: we can speak of the fundamentalist Christian reality tunnel or the ontological naturalist reality tunnel.

> A parallel can be seen in the psychological concept of confirmation bias—the human tendency to notice and assign significance to observations that confirm existing beliefs, while filtering out or rationalizing away observations that do not fit with prior beliefs and expectations. This helps to explain why reality tunnels are usually transparent to their inhabitants. While it seems most people take their beliefs to correspond to the ""one true objective reality"", Robert Anton Wilson emphasizes that each person's reality tunnel is their own artistic creation, whether they realize it or not.

Did you even research or just saw a photo of somthing related to tomhanks and posted it... this is why I am not arguing with you, I’m simply throwing in my two cents. 

Unless you’d rather I stop, I can let you enjoy in ignoring and telling anyone who doesn’t believe your conspiracy they’re a shill or wrong. That’s fucked up dude. 

If you would have done any research by googling “does kirsten dunst have kids” you would have learned that she had children so toys make sense. And when you’re bored stuck at home you post weird things. Her last post on IG regarding Pot Leaf. That has nothing to do with anything regarding Tom Hanks, is it part of the code? 

She had a son in 2018.

I don't think there's any question: pedophilia runs rampant in Hollywood, and in DC and in Vatican City and wherever there are people who truly wield dangerous power. I think it's used as a tool, and I think it's used to control, and to insure.

But I think these illuminati-type coded messages are bogus.

“What would be the reason for the conspiracy regarding photos being shared by celebs. Regarding Tom Hanks.”

How does that have to do with blood pressure. Why do you believe this conspiracy if you just said you didn’t do any research? 

If there was only 3 photos, you’d probably say it’s to random and weird for it to not be a conspiracy. 

Dozen of photos, you maybe say the same thing.. hm 

Interesting, you’re arguing with me instead of trying to enlighten me on the conspiracy you whole heartily believe.

Please stop changing the subject and reread my posts. And as an intelligent person please answer my questions. I’ll answer yours if you’d like to ask me some regarding my thoughts on the conspiracy :) please stay on topic, I’m surprised I haven’t moved on by now, but I’m very interested in seeing what you all do. 

So let’s do it! Let’s discuss! What this forum is here for! Why I’m here, and why I assume you’re here. I’m not working with everything going on, so I have all the time all day, all week, to sit here and talk with you.

As with most Hollywood re-imaginings, there are some elements that are changed in order to make for a better narrative, but the point remains and it's a lovely film regardless.  

I would recommend most of the books of Sacks, who died not so long ago. He is one of he few scientists who was able to simplify his subject matter without watering it down or patronising the reader and turn complicated neurology into something page-turningly interesting without it ever being pulpy or exploitative.

You can also see various interviews of his on Youtube to give you an impression of what he was like."

If you can find one or two people talking about it for weeks before it became popular it's probably worth researching.

He accused a lot of famous Hollywood people of pedophile rings and one of the people was Tom Hanks.  He goes into things very dark and saying there's a cult in Hollywood sacrificing children.  Sometime after accusing Tom Hanks he ended up dead on I-40 which some reddit comments are saying is part of the old Route 66 (they changed the name and broke it up in different segments is what it seems like people are saying) from suicide after “forcing himself off a Bridge and then being struck by a car.  Tom hanks posted on route 66 on Instagram BEFORE Kappy died ""Historic Route 66 roadkill?  Let's hope not...""  People are wondering if this was a precursor to Kappy's death.

This is gonna be a real cobweb of info so get ready... To begin, you must first get a brief synopsis of the QAnon conspiracy, which at the moment is considered a 'right-wing' conspiracy theory. It basically states that there's a deep state  (called The Cabal) that's run by the liberal elite, where they also do crazy rituals. These claims were based on email leaks of John Podesta, which were posted to WikiLeaks (which we'll get to later). It goes on to say that there's a ring is full of child exploitation and features many prominent members. 

Tom Hanks was accused of being a part of this group, but more in the Hollywood sector (Hollywood has an actual history of sexual exploition, look at Cosby and Weibstein). Other prominent people that were accused are Bill Gates and Lady Ga Ga. People have gone to point out that his reactions to Ricky Gervais's speech also allude to this. [Actor Issac Kappy had called him out on this](https://humansarefree.com/2018/08/tom-hanks-accused-of-buying-13-year-old-girl-from-her-father-and-raped-her-actor-isaac-kappy-recently-called-him-a-pedophile.html) and later Kappy himself apparently died of suicide, in which people believe he was murdered and his death was covered up because he wanted to expose the public. His death coupled with Hank's weird posting behaviour has led to an uproar. 

This all ties back into the pizzagate theory (which needs a whole new explanation on its own) which was basically a conspiracy that alluded to a pizza place harbouring child trafficking by disguising this in the form of emails using covert terms, such as cheese pizza, which meant child pornography. These emails were allegedly traced back to a large sex trafficking system involving Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein was well known amongst many persons, notably the Clinton's. Epstein was later labeled to have committed suicide whilst in a maximum security prison that was under 24/7 surveillance by guards and cameras, yet many find this suspicious and believe that he was instead murdered. The other claim going around is that Hanks flew with Epstein on the Lolita express, a private island of Epsteins where child trafficking had gone on. Trump had also addressed these accusations, where he claimed that they were true and that the elites must be stopped. [The whole pizzagate thing is briefly addressed in this CBS report too if you're interested](https://www.instagram.com/tv/B-xTA39gaDf/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)

Now bear with me, people are now saying that Tom Hanks might've been arrested for paedophilia and the Tom Hanks we saw on the quarantine edition of SNL is actually a deep fake, since he looks looked a bit younger and had a kitchen that was too small for a millionaire's home (people think it was all greenscreened). Then people began doubting his claim of getting infected from Covid-19

As of now, people think he was finally caught up and exposed by the public, so he fled to Australia, with some even claiming that he's got a warrant out for his arrest in the U.S. People believe that he's now being investigated by the Cia too. Others have claimed that he is already caught and imprisoned, but news of this isn't public. Finally, two recent documentaries that are claiming to expose this ring came out on YouTube with the title Out of the Shadows and Pedogate 2020, which helped get this theory going again.

There are also a lot of Russian comments I noticed on his insta; luckily I can read Russian and most of them said for Hank to stop buying kids and murdering them for his own enjoyment and for development of an alleged drug called Adrenochrome (this is supposed to be the drug of the elite and its featured in the movie/book Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas as a fictional drug). 

This rabbit hole goes much deeper and I only scratched the surface of this theory. Many claim this is the truth and others explain that this is just a hoax made by the right wingers; I personally don't know. I tried my best to sum it up lol. Feel free to point out any errors/inconsistencies so that I can fix them! )) 

TL;DR Tom Hanks is allegedly involved with a group of elites paedophiles that traffics children and murders them; this claim gained more traction because of the death of Issac Kappy after 'calling Hanks out' and several documentaries posted to YouTube that are recently addressing this topic."

927,2020-04-20 08:04:24,g4krxa,"These are big accusations to be leveling and to be stitching together, without any receipts.

It's one thing to suggest that Hollywood is about money and power - of course it is, it's a major business. Not that big a leap either that the rich and powerful, some of which are in Hollywood have access to networks of child sex traffickers. Worth noting that those people are not always beyond being exposed- see Dennis Hastert (although it's an absolute fucking crime he only did 13 months). Networks operating around foster care have been broken up before.

Now, you are asking people to take a huge leap of faith going from that point to the rich and powerful are child-murdering vampires, and apparently the only hard evidence of this is a video that may or may not exist and some easily spoofed posts? Don't tell me that's not a big leap of faith you expect people to take."

It was just a list that someone (most likely not a native English speaker) had made up. 

I mean I could waste time and go through all the made-up shit in that answer, but there's no point -- the poster hasn't bothered to fact check any of it. 

So, sure you can't see a reason other than ""being afraid it's true"" but ""it's mostly a bunch of made-up right-wing fantasies"" is a pretty good reason, which seems to have flown way overt your head."

You combine a few actual facts with 90% of a convolute of rumors and myths with the only foundation that they were made public by some random ass internet person with less than 0 credibility as a source. 

You draw lines between unrelated events by connecting them via those rumors and myths and jump between topics that have literally no connection if you consider actual facts. You bring up these topic changes that seem to be completely random in a way that tries to make them look natural, but has the need to actually believe all of those rumors and myths.

You argue you don‘t ‚believe’ them - but time will tell whats true. Time did. Again and again. And you still ‚believe‘ in this, because if not you wouldn‘t have written all this conspiracy stuff in a manner that tries to convince others that it is reality.

Your post is a class A conspiracy theorist example. You take a few real facts and construct a false narrative and reality around them by the means of internet rumors, myths and lies.

If you actually think you aren‘t biased, you might be a lost cause. But please wake the fuck up, for your own good as well as that of everyone around you."

987,2020-04-20 08:25:24,g4krxa,"Literally the only find relating to the Brad Pitt quote on the first 3 pages of multiple google searches is that the thing you tried to quote is not from a real interview, but a made up one. 

And what you said is just semantics. If you preface an argument by saying ‚I don‘t say this is a fact, but this is what people say‘, only to explain in great length what these people believe without a single moment of questioning or a sign of thinking by yourself - then you don‘t REALLY say that this isn‘t your opinion. What you say is ‚I don‘t want to be called out on my shit, but this is what I believe‘.

This tactic is and was used not just by conspiracy theorists such as yourself, but also by regimes, cults and discriminatory groups for hundreds of years now.

‚This isn‘t my opinion, but word on the street is that jews are dirty money hogging animals that are worth less than the arian people living here‘.

The tool you use to spread disinformation and lies is the same tool the nazis used. The same tool people use to spread their sick ideas about other human beings being worth less than themselves. It is just used for a different cause in your case, but that does NOT make it right.

Just because you say it is not your opinion doesn‘t mean we can‘t read between the fucking lines. If you spread rumors and myths like this without questioning them a single time, completely unironically with the statement ‚we will see what is true‘ - then you can say that this isn‘t your opinion a million times. Everyone reading knows that this is a lie. You do, I do and anyone able to stop and think for a second knows."

1002,2020-05-03 13:53:50,gcq0e7,"The other comments say Tobey as Uncle Ben, but I personally can't see it happening. I want him to have a more major role. I also never thought as Keanu as Namor, they work perfectly. I can also see DiCaprio as Doc Ock if he grows out his hair and puts on weight"
1003,2020-05-03 16:50:06,gcq0e7,"I'd love to see Minotaur fight Hulk at some point, so i would not mind that, but Minotaur has less of an MCU-ish backstory than Gorr. Jefferson Davis is basically the perfect role for Will Smith btw."
1004,2020-05-03 13:40:45,gcq0e7,"We can hope, but they most certainly won't make an R-rated sequel to Ragnarok. They can get away with some brutal violence by implying a ton of it rather than actually showing it. 

Two more benefits of adding Gorr:

1) It can introduce other pantheons of gods like the Greek gods (Hercules!) and whichever others they wish to explore. 

2) Gorr's sword could and should be the very thing that produces symbiotes. Gorr's presence and combat can lead to symbiotes being expelled into the world accidentally. Or maybe Gorr does it intentionally as an interesting way to destroy worlds."
1005,2020-05-03 13:57:38,gcq0e7,"Hmmm I can't see Tobey as anyone to be honest I just said uncle Ben as a joke. I could see him getting a cameo. Let's say Chameleon is the villain and he has to pretend to be a random citizen so he morphs into tobey's face that would be cool.

I couldn't think of anyone for Leo, so put doc Ock I don't think he has to be fat though. Look at Gotham with the penguin."

1034,2020-05-03 09:05:19,gcn5xm,"There is an attempt to ridicule U.S. values. Particularly the 2nd Amendment, which is one of the most righteous things available on planet Earth. The 1st Amendment is similarly vulnerable to NPCs holding their wrists out.

Decentralization is always key. Decentralize everything. The revolution always starts at your home & it’s not what it looks like in the movies. (Remember, that’s one of their propaganda arms.) Revolution doesn’t have to be violent or dramatic. That’s a fear-based trick to make us averse to trying.

The real revolution, the thing that scares the empire the most, is us growing food reasonably, collaborating with neighbors & communities, keeping a close eye on schools, homeschooling, leveling up your skills, making plans that fit the land you live on, generating harmony & a sustainable lifestyle. It’s not commuting for work. It’s learning how to generate wealth & productivity in ways that are meaningful for your locale. Repairing things. Focusing on analog, serviceable machines & technology. Focusing on cultivating healthy wildlife populations in your locale & practicing ethical, sustainable subsistence. It’s preserving food without plastic & excessive refined sugar. It’s rejecting 90% of the products you see in grocery stores—the toxic made-up beauty products that send you & the planet to an early grave. The shitty meat, white powders, pussy milk, genetically modified crops. Those things should be invisible to your path. If we all ignore them they can’t exist.

It’s protecting your children & the children around you so they maintain their innocence, creativity & confidence. Children come to Earth to teach *us* because they are closer to god. It’s backwards right now.

This Thing happening is a stunning opportunity for us to bolster our localities, infiltrate & show up to community council meetings & cover neighborhoods in food. Then start addressing the toxic public education. Redesign your income. Cook most of your meals. Do everything more thoughtfully & with pride. Get books on homesteading, permaculture, natural beauty/personal care products, trail guides, local plant guides, take gun safety classes. You can live anywhere in the U.S. & live a radically atavistic lifestyle & we destroy their tricks to destroy us by disengaging.

The elite want us dumb, lazy & uninspired because they do not want us self-sufficient & living in harmony with nature."
1035,2020-05-03 08:54:27,gcn5xm,I just came across this blog earlier today and I find it really insightful and helpful. Thanks for spreading the word
1036,2020-05-03 09:15:18,gcn5xm,"Though I found this to be one of the most in-depth articles I've read in while on the matter, there are a few reasons why it left me confused and unclear as to whether it is legit. Or better yet, even written by a gatekeeper/shill.

1. The mentioning of Tom Hanks' tweets was unnecessary. Sure, they may be containing some symbolisms, but I don't find them to be a strong enough argument to be mentioned in such a detailed breakdown.
2. No mention whatsoever of Mr Vax himself: Shill Bates. So wait, Forrest Gump receives an honourable mention, but one of the most prominent figures at the heart of this plandemic gets completely left out? (definitely weird)
3. Though I have considered many times that many conspiracies could in fact be placed there as breadcrumbs for the purpose of actually being revealed, I'm not entirely convinced that they ALL are. But who knows, maybe I'm wrong.
4. Some of those possible outcomes suggested sound a lot more like internal intel, more than conclusions put together by an actually curious critical thinker. Though I may just not be as good at maths as the writer is.

To sum up, I really enjoyed the way this article was put together, and gave me a lot of food for thought, but I certainly cannot deny there is a small part of me inside that smells a bit of gatekeeping (particularly the lack of mentions of Shill Bates).  


EDIT: NOT (as good at maths...)"
1037,2020-05-03 11:03:20,gcn5xm,"The fundamental aspect is not ""subverting institutions.""  That's just a side-effect.  The article mentions the real agenda:  blame shifting.  Whether natural or manufactured, COVID-19 makes a great scapegoat."

1042,2020-05-03 10:08:06,gcn5xm,"Though I have my own doubts about Q's true nature, that's a valid point."
1043,2020-05-03 12:37:26,gcn5xm,"Yeah, that too. Wasn't too sure what to make of it. On one hand, it seems obvious that they want to provoke people to revolt, possibly for a higher purpose. On the other hand, I'm sure nobody wants a global revolution. So  it sort of caught me off guard. 

Thing is, a lot of sheeple and/or NPCs get criticized of cognitive dissonance, forgetting though that the same could apply to critical thinkers, to the point where they are so far down the rabbit hole that anything that makes them question their own theories might get called out as gatekeeping or shillish. So I certainly try to be open minded enough to make space for anything that contradicts my own reality and beliefs.

But this article certainly has some weirdness about it."

1198,2020-05-02 19:35:40,gcbk7o,The press corps. It would literaly cost each of them like $2 if they pooled their money. They work for some of the largest publications in the world I think they can afford it. It shouldn't fall to the taxpayers to buy your coffee maker.

Also, this washed away the boy band stench from donnie wahlberg. 
I also love the episode where they get a new liutenant who is a fucking badass and runs right into the nazis to hook up with a lost company on the other side of the wall but then comes back. I think its the same episode. Wonder if it was in here."

My suggestion is to watch a couple of documentaries like The World at War, Shoah, Ken Burns's The War so as to deepen your knowledge and then watch films in random order. (Unfortunately, I don't think there are long top tier documentaries focused on the two most important sides, the Germans and the Russians.)

The idea of watching films in chronological order though is a good one for other topics where there are less good films and/or the story is less well known. I've been employing this method and I'd recommend it in subjects like First World War, Ancient Rome, Bible, British Monarchy."

1316,2020-05-02 17:09:21,gc92i7,"An interesting mix of fiction and true events, and is missing quite a few movies (the whole list would be unwieldy). Wondering what criteria was used to pick these movies."
1317,2020-05-02 17:52:58,gc92i7,"Defiance, Valkyrie, and Fury would be fun additions."
1318,2020-05-02 23:33:37,gc92i7,Letters from Iwo Jima
1319,2020-05-03 01:42:29,gc92i7,D-day was June 6 1944. Anzio should be before Saving Private Ryan and The Longest Day.
1320,2020-05-02 23:33:27,gc92i7,You skipped the whole 1940 battle of France
1321,2020-05-03 17:23:09,gc92i7,"Looks like we got the Brits in round one.

We kicked their ass in WW2.

Cheerio lets do it again."
1322,2020-05-02 22:59:35,gc92i7,[removed]
1323,2020-05-02 16:17:59,gc92i7,We were all there for that one. It just cuts too deep...
1324,2020-05-02 16:53:34,gc92i7,It's on the list right next to inglorious basterds
1325,2020-05-02 21:19:17,gc92i7,"You joke, but OP actually missed the classic Overlord movie from 1975: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlord_(1975_film)
It's highly rated and won a few awards."
1326,2020-05-03 00:35:52,gc92i7,Or Kung Fury?
1327,2020-05-02 16:20:55,gc92i7,[deleted]
1328,2020-05-02 17:09:22,gc92i7,It was already made. We're living in it!
1329,2020-05-03 16:02:17,gc92i7,I don’t have nearly the movie knowledge to make it but I always thought it would be cool to come up with a 20th century cinematic universe that takes you from WW1 all the way to 9-11 through existing film
1330,2020-05-03 19:49:56,gc92i7,One that might be more visually interesting than the MCU!
1331,2020-05-02 16:50:39,gc92i7,Shit! I fucking forgot that! Goddamn it!!!!!
1332,2020-05-02 21:20:46,gc92i7,There's probably hundreds of fantastic movies I missed.
1333,2020-05-02 20:00:47,gc92i7,"If this guy combined his forces with mine, we'd be unstoppable. We could even do one for World War 1."
1334,2020-05-02 23:35:00,gc92i7,Your post didn't skip the whole 1940 battle of France. Good.
1335,2020-05-03 07:16:11,gc92i7,They listed Europa Europa three times and others multiple times. A couple 2017 films suggests the list isn't too old.
1336,2020-05-02 21:32:55,gc92i7,That's just a spinoff in the WW2CU!
1337,2020-05-02 16:56:53,gc92i7,"I already included one Nuremberg movie and by that point, I just wanted to wrap this thing up."
1338,2020-05-02 23:20:45,gc92i7,"Judgement at Nuremberg is more of a Cold War movie than WWII.  It takes place in 1948 and deals with Cold War issues such as the Berlin Blockade.  Also, it isn't historically accurate.  It's more of a fictional interpretation of the actual trials.  The real trials had hundreds of defendants, not four.  I don't think any of the defendants in the movie are real people.

The Nuremberg movie is reproduction of the actual event, not an interpretation.  The defendants are real people."
1339,2020-05-02 17:58:40,gc92i7,"It actually was on the list at first, but I took it out because of the reasons you mentioned. That's also why I included Schindler's List at the very end rather than in the middle somewhere."
1340,2020-05-02 17:00:49,gc92i7,"Probably, if I tried."
1341,2020-05-02 17:52:34,gc92i7,I probably will do an updated version at some point. There's a few movies I didn't include and probably should.
1342,2020-05-02 18:11:19,gc92i7,"I wanted to include Empire of the Sun, but I tried to avoid movies that covered too many events in it's runtime, like The Pianist and Patton. I completely forgot about Valkyrie and decided on Letters from Iwo Jima rather than Flags of our Fathers. I'll probably make an updated list at some point."
1343,2020-05-02 16:57:33,gc92i7,Never seen it. Any good?
1344,2020-05-03 11:52:28,gc92i7,"There are so many movies on there, haha.  I had already linking it above in response to someone wanting a list for ""the history of the world""."
1345,2020-05-02 17:42:49,gc92i7,Interesting. Never actually heard of it until now. Thanks for sharing 🙂
1346,2020-05-02 18:33:05,gc92i7,Oops. 🤦‍♂️
1347,2020-05-02 17:24:56,gc92i7,The most accurate portrayal of Hitler ever put to screen.
1348,2020-05-02 17:51:33,gc92i7,I'll probably make an updated version at some point.
1349,2020-05-02 19:37:28,gc92i7,I started that once but it proved to be too monumental a task for one man.
1350,2020-05-03 03:01:08,gc92i7,"i saw a timeline once that had 1,000 movies that covered each’s years portrayed in the movie.

The project started by trying to show how crappy “the future” was portrayed for years that we’ve already passed a la Back to the Future 2 being 2015 and bladerunner being 2019, but turned into that."
1351,2020-05-03 11:40:49,gc92i7,"I think this list was made a while ago, but this is what you're look for.  [Link](http://www.vernonjohns.org/snuffy1186/movies.html).  That's a lot of movies!"
1352,2020-05-02 19:49:24,gc92i7,I almost had The Boys From Brazil as an epilogue.
1353,2020-05-02 23:41:01,gc92i7,"Right now, I feel like Charlie Kelley trying to find Pepe Silvia."
1354,2020-05-03 08:17:31,gc92i7,And who can forget about the other great german anti war movies like Die Brücke (1959) and Der Hauptmann (2017)
1355,2020-05-03 00:44:56,gc92i7,"Oh, there's many movies missing from this list. I feel like Charlie Kelley trying to find Pepe Silvia. I've got boxes full of old war movies! And this Robert Mitchum guy keeps popping up all over the place! One minute he's young, the next minute he's old!"
1356,2020-05-03 11:36:36,gc92i7,"Cross of Iron (1977) is great!  It was very poorly reviewed upon release, so ended up kind of being forgotten about."
1357,2020-05-03 15:43:44,gc92i7,Making it look like it came out in the 40s would START with it being black and white... What else did it do to look like it came out them?
1358,2020-05-03 10:04:17,gc92i7,"I thought it was appropriate for it to be at the end, so it isn't muddled in with the others. I think the film should stand on its own."
1359,2020-05-02 17:20:13,gc92i7,"I almost included Big Red One. But I tried to avoid movies that covered too many events at once, like Patton."
1360,2020-05-02 22:52:33,gc92i7,I'm well aware of that.
1361,2020-05-03 02:28:07,gc92i7,"Wonder Woman was World War 1, not World War 2"
1362,2020-05-02 21:47:27,gc92i7,"Sorry. I tried, really I did. 🥺"
1363,2020-05-02 22:52:52,gc92i7,I don't think the goal is to instill clinical depression.
1364,2020-05-03 15:47:47,gc92i7,"Some of my favourite emotional destroyers: Grave, railway man, letters from iwo jima. But Grave... Holy fuck. I start to cry if I ever see a tin of Japanese hard candies."
1365,2020-05-02 16:37:25,gc92i7,Which one? I almost included the one from 1971 but decided not to.
1366,2020-05-03 15:42:21,gc92i7,I'm mad they didn't include 10000 BC
1367,2020-05-03 08:50:29,gc92i7,[deleted]
1368,2020-05-02 16:57:05,gc92i7,I shudder to think.
1369,2020-05-02 17:16:17,gc92i7,"It's not, and I'm pissed off that I forgot it. Not necessarily that movie, but definitely the event."
1370,2020-05-02 17:57:20,gc92i7,"I thought about it. But I wanted to stick to movies on this list. If I do an updated version, I might use certain episodes of Band of Brothers if a movie doesn't cover a certain event."
1371,2020-05-02 18:48:33,gc92i7,It started when I watched Battle of Britain right after Dunkirk. It felt like I was watching an actual sequel. Then my mind started spinning...
1372,2020-05-03 11:44:12,gc92i7,That's not true.  It deals with the aftermath of the 1972 Olympic Games massacre.  It's more about terrorism than war proper.   Fantastic movie.
1373,2020-05-02 19:38:43,gc92i7,Nuremberg from 2001 has the bigger villains such as Göring
1374,2020-05-02 22:53:33,gc92i7,I'm working on an updated version.
1375,2020-05-02 21:29:12,gc92i7,I was waiting for someone to mention that 😂
1376,2020-05-03 11:50:11,gc92i7,"It is set in late 1940, so it would be right after The Battle Of Britain.  Or before.  The timelines overlap."
1377,2020-05-03 15:51:18,gc92i7,Oh right... They get sent away from London in the first 5 seconds.
1378,2020-05-02 22:50:23,gc92i7,I think The Longest Day is better in that spot before Saving Private Ryan.
1379,2020-05-02 23:01:45,gc92i7,I did come across it in my travels.
1380,2020-05-02 23:01:14,gc92i7,I'm thinking of doing that where there aren't any movies covering certain events.
1381,2020-05-03 15:55:28,gc92i7,"I know. There's over 1,300 world war 2 movies. It's starting to feel less like a hobby and more like a full time job trying to track them all down and work out a timeline."
1382,2020-05-02 17:12:43,gc92i7,"I watched a documentary series called The World at War, It was a series that aired in the UK in 1973. I watched every episode and every time a significant battle or event was mentioned, I went online and checked if there was a movie made about it. Most of the time there was. When there wasn't, I tried to fill in the blanks with fictional movies like Where Eagles Dare and The Guns of Navarone."
1383,2020-05-02 23:34:45,gc92i7,That's on there.
1384,2020-05-02 23:00:04,gc92i7,[removed]
1385,2020-05-02 22:43:30,gc92i7,"It might be interesting to put together a list of purely fictional WWII events.  So, Overlord, Basterds, The Dirty Dozen, U-571, Captain America, etc..."
1386,2020-05-02 16:24:53,gc92i7,Nope. 🥺
1387,2020-05-02 19:32:15,gc92i7,I hope they reboot the universe though. Ever since end of world wars it feels like it's been always a bleak and hopeless world. They could make people smarter after the wars imo.
1388,2020-05-02 20:07:42,gc92i7,"Well, that's the difference between a universe and a cinematic universe."
1389,2020-05-03 07:28:40,gc92i7,Edit it in
1390,2020-05-03 02:55:57,gc92i7,"or, you know, just his list

:()"
1391,2020-05-03 13:44:08,gc92i7,"I assume it’s because Europa, Europa takes place over a longer period of the war. Fucking fantastic film too."
1392,2020-05-02 17:19:50,gc92i7,"I'll probably get rid of the other one since Judgement is so well regarded. I think this is really nicely done though. Just the other day someone asked about themed movies to put together and I rattled off a long list of WWII movies, picturing something just like this. I've saved this.  to expand on it as I come across more movies and research some of the others that I know take place at that time. This will make a great theme forJuly."
1393,2020-05-03 12:38:01,gc92i7,Why is Schindler's List at the very end? Shouldn't a movie about the Holocaust be before the one about the Nuremberg trial?
1394,2020-05-02 23:22:34,gc92i7,Nuremberg (2000) is about the same event.
1395,2020-05-02 23:29:05,gc92i7,It is truly the best film I can only watch once.
1396,2020-05-03 01:42:16,gc92i7,"Actually, if you simply put the movie titles in bold print, it would help out a lot."
1397,2020-05-02 18:22:33,gc92i7,"So you limited it to event specific movies. Either short time frames or singular events makes sense. If you get the itch you could expand it and include a larger scale event pictures as well. I'd argue Schindler's List is already that. 

It's a great start. There are very few comprehensive WW2 lists. A lot of top 20 lists but nothing comprehensive. The formatting is blah, need to bold the titles and add some hyphens but still overall awesome job."
1398,2020-05-02 20:31:18,gc92i7,Its historical fiction and therefore not something to be found on this list.
1399,2020-05-02 17:05:03,gc92i7,"Yes. I’m not usually a fan  of the director nor even some of the actors, but everything gelled perfectly in this one."
1400,2020-05-02 17:08:33,gc92i7,"I really enjoyed the movie. The tank battles were realistic and wonderful. The last 5 minutes of the movie were the only 'hollywooded' parts, so as a whole the movie was great."
1401,2020-05-02 17:16:13,gc92i7,"Not really, watch it if you like seeing A-listers in costumes paling around with each other."
1402,2020-05-02 18:58:51,gc92i7,"one of my favorite ""fuck it I have no idea what this movie is but I am in the mood for something in the Theater tonight"" movies.  I was very lucky to catch this during its really short run. I am sure it was a financial bomb as it is pretty forgotten (though does come up on r/movies every now and again)  but a really good story that is very well done with some great performances."
1403,2020-05-02 17:27:19,gc92i7,Definitely not a good time to be a Nazi.
1404,2020-05-03 02:57:05,gc92i7,"nah, inglourious basterds takes that prize"
1405,2020-05-14 00:54:21,gc92i7,Please do! My high school students are learning about WW2 right now and I want to show them this list!
1406,2020-05-02 22:50:47,gc92i7,Years ago I tried doing that just for ancient Rome and it became far more sprawling and daunting than I had anticipated.
1407,2020-05-03 11:49:45,gc92i7,"Oh, damn."
1408,2020-05-03 04:15:00,gc92i7,The Producers would make a great epilogue.
1409,2020-05-03 03:10:59,gc92i7,Ha! That’s what I was thinking.
1410,2020-05-02 22:58:57,gc92i7,You made captian angry.. He's coming for you civilwar 2
1411,2020-05-03 02:37:14,gc92i7,Omg! I haven't realised it till now! Thanks BTW
1412,2020-05-03 00:38:10,gc92i7,They're all war movies. PTSD is the name of the game.
1413,2020-05-02 16:43:15,gc92i7,Might as well go with both.
1414,2020-05-03 17:41:25,gc92i7,reading is hard
1415,2020-05-02 22:48:01,gc92i7,There was also an episode of Highlander where Duncan MacLeod tried to blow up Hitler.
1416,2020-05-03 15:56:11,gc92i7,LOL - yeah that thread is crazy! Cheers!
1417,2020-05-02 17:39:26,gc92i7,My dad was a huge fan of that series when it came out. Interesting method. thanks for sharing.
1418,2020-05-03 04:17:40,gc92i7,Captain America was fictional!?
1419,2020-05-03 08:13:11,gc92i7,Saving Private Ryan
1420,2020-05-03 06:53:45,gc92i7,"Guns of Navarone, Force 10 from Navarone"
1421,2020-05-02 22:38:58,gc92i7,But the information age gave us memes.
1422,2020-05-02 23:43:21,gc92i7,Wait til you see the next instalment in the series
1423,2020-05-02 17:21:16,gc92i7,I look forward to viewing the results 😊
1424,2020-05-03 12:40:03,gc92i7,"You could also pair it with the classic documentary series, [The World at War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_at_War). It wouldn't be a one-to-one match with the subject matters of the movies, but it might come pretty close."
1425,2020-05-03 12:50:09,gc92i7,I felt that Schindler's List should be at the end rather than mixed in with all the others. It's so powerful that I think it deserves to stand on its own.
1426,2020-05-02 23:30:33,gc92i7,"No, Judgement at Nuremberg is based on the smaller trials that followed the big trial.  

Nuremberg is about the first war trial feature the top dogs in the Third Reich, including the Goering, Keitel and Jodl (army), Rader and Donitz (navy), Streicher (newspapers), Hess and Speer (high ranking Nazi party and government members), etc.  This trial was for the leading members of various parts of the Third Reich.

Judgement at Nuremberg is about the [subsequent trials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsequent_Nuremberg_trials).  Subsequent trials focused on specific parts of the Reich, such as doctors, the SS, government ministers, and in the movie, the judges and jurists."
1427,2020-05-02 18:26:13,gc92i7,I included Schindler's List at the very end so it didn't stick out in the middle.
1428,2020-05-02 23:46:19,gc92i7,"A lot of movies on that last are historical fiction.  Fury is not much different than Enemy at the Gates or the Thin Red Line.  Fury is basically Das Boot on a tank.

Fury would make a nice addition to the list because it is one of the few movies which takes place between the end of the Battle of the Bulge to the end of the war.  In the movie, the Americans are actually in Germany at this point.  There are a couple of Band of Brothers episodes from this time, but I can't think of anything else."
1429,2020-05-02 22:29:35,gc92i7,Its about as realistic as saving private Ryan.
1430,2020-05-03 01:05:46,gc92i7,"...

have you *looked* at some of the movies on this list?"
1431,2020-05-03 02:54:50,gc92i7,"uhhh have you not seen half of these?

enemy at the gates? lol"
1432,2020-05-03 15:39:47,gc92i7,Well End of Watch was great but since then David ayers has been... Different.
1433,2020-05-02 19:39:02,gc92i7,"> The tank battles were realistic and wonderful.

Nope. A Tiger charging 5 Shermans isn't realistic. But still a decent movie.

^^unless ^^you ^^were ^^being ^^sarcastic ^^then ^^forget ^^what ^^i ^^said."
1434,2020-05-03 01:03:09,gc92i7,I think only the first 5 minutes were good :)
1435,2020-05-02 17:16:45,gc92i7,"AKA, every movie on this list."
1436,2020-05-03 15:40:50,gc92i7,That kid is gonna be a fucking star he's already in the new home alone movie.
1437,2020-05-02 23:00:26,gc92i7,Right
1438,2020-05-04 00:14:04,gc92i7,Yw
1439,2020-05-02 23:29:59,gc92i7,Soon we'll invade countries looking for weapons of meme destruction.
1440,2020-05-02 22:54:24,gc92i7,"So I spent about 4 hours researching movies today. I never knew just how many there are in some way related to the war, even if you remove all of the ones that are poorly rated, hard or impossible to find, are propaganda, or are fiction that goes too far beyond the historical. This is going to be a long process, and I'm going to be watching a lot of war films here soon. By the end I'd like to have a curated list of the war in 100 obtainable films. That means researching, watching, and then cutting a whole lot. Thanks for the inspiration!"
1441,2020-05-04 04:20:08,gc92i7,Doesn't that defeat the purpose of the entire post?
1442,2020-05-02 23:33:21,gc92i7,"I see. In that case I'd include both. The timeline I ended up with goes from the early 20s to to late 50s. As a history grad, I like my causes and effects."
1443,2020-05-03 01:00:29,gc92i7,">There are a couple of Band of Brothers episodes from this time, but I can't think of anything else.

""Der Hauptmann""/The captain is a German war movie that takes place in April 1945. It was a bit overlooked mainly IMO because its pretty dark. The story seems unbelievable, but is modeled closely after real events. 

""Die Brücke"", a 1950s German anti-war movie classic, is also in late 1945. 

""Bridge of Remagen"" is also in early 1945. Solid but not one of the best."
1444,2020-05-03 01:05:56,gc92i7,or Enemy at the Gates lol.
1445,2020-05-02 23:02:21,gc92i7,And wonder woman 2020

From what I can tell, they believe that Hanks was under house arrest for being a pedophile. This is not remotely true.

Even further down the rabbit hole, QANON believes that the Corona Virus is an operating cover for a movement to arrest all satanic pedophiles. Anyone who dies of Corona virus is supposedly a pedophile committing suicide.

1478,2020-05-05 18:49:19,gc6sfg,Debris and News.
1479,2020-05-06 19:22:09,gc6sfg,"I didn't enjoy DEBRIS at all. It's the same old procedural with some advanved tech thrown in. Here's an idea, let's take MEN IN BLACK and throw out all the wacky aliens and interesting characters. The main characters are plain and the idea does not seem new. I'll be skipping this one."
1480,2020-05-06 20:31:22,gc6sfg,Debris and some of the BL script.
1481,2020-05-07 14:17:27,gc6sfg,"Reading NEWS OF THE WORLD. It's pretty good. It's about a traveling news 'reader' who's trying to return a white girl who's been raised by Native Americans to her relatives. I was fascinated by the job of news 'reader'. He goes from town to town reading the news in a large hall. The girl doesn't speak any English and seeing her fish out of water reactions were also mildly amusing. And the story starts right away on p6 without much setup, which hurts in the character department, but the fast pace and interesting world build's making this a quick afternoon read."
1482,2020-05-07 16:05:08,gc6sfg,"Finished NEWS OF THE WORLD and this script got me. It got me good. I absolutely loved this.

The captain and the girl travel together as she starts to help him by taking dimes at his showing. They bond further when some dangerous men tries to take her and they have to defend themselves. When they make it to the relative's place and he has to leaver her there, their emotions are complex. His purpose not just in his life, but all life, this young girl who has to endured so much and still has to find her place in the world. Two unlikely people forming a bond. It's a story as old as time, we've all seen it, but I'm going to think about this one for a while."
1483,2020-05-07 17:28:14,gc6sfg,Reading THE HOUSE IS NOT FOR SALE. Anyone else confused by who Margo is on page 1?
1484,2020-05-08 15:46:12,gc6sfg,"I also read THE HOUSE IS NOT FOR SALE. I was confused by the first few pages, then I realized this was a comedy. There's one sequence in the middle of the script that really sold it for me, it was a sequence where she decides to contact ghost hunters to stay in the house. I loved this idea. Then when that fails, she calls in all the famous ghost hunters from other franchises, Constantine, the ghost busters (the female reboot), and such. The rest of the script is OK, but this one sequence made it a worth while read for me."
1485,2020-05-08 22:40:15,gc6sfg,Lasted about 40 pages with DEBRIS.  Scifi two hander never makes the rules of the world clear and is constantly changing them.  What initially seems like spaceship debris that kills becomes that's internalized by its victims which is where I checked out.
1486,2020-05-11 05:52:31,gc6sfg,"I enjoyed NEWS OF THE WORLD.  Perfect part for Tom Hanks.  Reminds me of TRUE GRIT with spunky young woman paired with grizzled old man, but I may like this better.  Episodic, with a fair amount of humor but also with an undercurrent of lurking violence with one very violent scene where the little girl JOHANNA gets KIdd out of a certain-death predicament.  I liked the ending where when Johanna is reunited with her family, the family does *not* welcome her with open arms.  The scene of Kidd and Johnna reuniting and running off together at the end has been used in other movies but it still works.  Looking forward to the movie."
1487,2020-05-07 21:55:32,gc6sfg,Sounds like a great premise. Never heard of that either.
1488,2020-05-08 15:21:27,gc6sfg,Its' based on a novel. I'll probably pick it up and read it at some point. I'm a sucker for these 'underdog outcasts finding eachother' stories.

Since when was he ever considered a tryhard badass in Gangs of New York? Or even Departed, or Blood Diamond? He wasn't trying to do some strong alpha male role here, ultra action star, to be all tough and whatnot.

Shutter Island makes no sense to compare. No one was being a badass in anyway.

Your list of examples is nonsense. You basically just want a pretty boy Titanic Jack in every film. He has been better ever since then. The way I see it, you just don't like the actor."

Every actor has the strengths and weaknesses. DiCaprio is boyish, which is fine, but he keeps trying to play more gruff, masculine types (how you don’t see how his character is supposed to be a tough guy in Gangs of New York is astonishing). He is not believable as a hard nosed, weathered WW2 vet/Boston cop in Shutter Island. He comes off like a teenager dressing up in his dads detective uniform and “playing” a 1940’s cop. The “most” acting isn’t the best acting. 

And no, he is definitely better when he was a teenager in This Boys Life."
1519,2020-05-02 09:51:16,gc3mk4,Hmm. Good one.and he has actually gotten worse over time. He played a better badasses in pitch black and the first FF (still not great) then he has in the last 15 years lol. He is so self serious lol
1520,2020-05-02 12:06:28,gc3mk4,"I can't stand Tom Cruise, but a big reason why is that he's incredibly good at his job. People want to trash on him, but the fact of the matter is that Tom Cruise is a great actor. A Few Good Men, Rain Man, The Last Samurai, these kinds of films he does that are not all about action and wild stunts would have exposed him if he was as bad as people say, they didn't. They highlighted his range as more than an action movie star.

I hate everything about Tom Cruise, the fact that he's really good at what he does makes me hate him even more."

1523,2020-05-02 10:00:02,gc3mk4,"Lol yep. I knew I would catch some flack because this board adores him but I have never understood it. As an adult he just comes off trying too hard most of the time; it reads very false to me.

1536,2020-05-02 13:20:22,gc3mk4,"The point is that the role he is playing is that of an insecure badass. When he gets the script i think it probably says something along those lines. Look at gangs of new york, his character is meant to be this gangster that isn't quite sure of where he stands."
1537,2020-05-03 07:23:55,gc3mk4,"I guess you can't be helped. I don't really see him as being a badass in some way. Or trying for that matter. He's just doing a role that suits him.

As for what believe-ability he has for Shutter Island. The only thing I can say is, some people can and do look like that. What are you expecting? Some 60 year old with war wrinkles and scars? What does it take? They didn't get some teenager for the role."
1538,2020-05-02 12:09:49,gc3mk4,That is why I stated action movie cause annoyingly I loved him in Last Samurai

Like he was a good actor until like Infinity War but in previous two years, his ""dramatic"" scenes in Endgame and far from home absolutely sucked.

Who he is is someone who has supposed to have  had a hard, tough as nails life, who is naturally tough because of it. I don’t believe him at all. I don’t believe DiCaprio as a this character. He comes off like an actor “playing” a roughneck; not naturally “being” it."
1549,2020-05-03 07:55:20,gc3mk4,"It’s not just about how you look, it’s about how you hold yourself, your cadence, your sense of authority. DiCaprio has none. He is not suited for these roles.

This is clearly too difficult for you to understand. Just continue watching DiCaprio grimace and scowl his way through these types of roles. You clearly don’t care for natural, subtle acting."
1550,2020-05-02 10:07:17,gc3mk4,"Yeah, I though he was really good and it was a heartbreaking role"
1551,2020-05-02 09:52:49,gc3mk4,"The real Hughes had insecurities and anxieties, but he never came off as a child dressing up as a “man”"
1552,2020-05-02 09:49:48,gc3mk4,"Well. I would have to go through a lot of actors but off the top of my head, his co star, Mark Ruffalo would have been more natural in Shutter Island (or younger Paul Newman or Robert Duvall or gene Hackman).

fassbender or Tom Hardy could have done better in Gangs, the departed and shutter island. Fassbender would also have been a much better Howard Hughes.

Damien Lewis for the departed perhaps.

I will have to take some time to think of some more. But all the actors listed I think would do a more subtle job then DiCaprio."

1556,2020-05-02 10:08:28,gc3mk4,Any examples? Or just blanket statements?
1557,2020-05-02 14:11:09,gc3mk4,Thanks for the response. Is there anything else that you think it is that makes actors come off as false in their performance?
1558,2020-05-02 10:58:53,gc3mk4,"I actually thought he did better then expected. While he does have scenes where he does his same bit I have been complaining about, there are some scenes where he is playing the character much more relaxed and resigned, he comes off more comfortable in his skin as a weathered, gruff tracker, which I think is more authentic."
1559,2020-05-03 08:05:46,gc3mk4,"I'll just boil down the reason to that you simply just don't like the guy. Not every actor can win everyone over. No matter how good they are. That simple. You will always see him as some teenager from The Beach, and nothing else more."
1560,2020-05-02 09:58:52,gc3mk4,"I agree with most of choices except for the Departed.

Isn't the point of his character that he is completely out of his depth and is slowly going out of his mind? To have him be played as a badass would take away from the movie, atleast in my opinion.

Otherwise you're right Gangs of New York is a worse movie because of Leo."
1561,2020-05-02 18:49:59,gc3mk4,Mark Ruffalo is terrible. He's just Mark Ruffalo in everything. Never liked him in anything.

1563,2020-05-02 15:32:46,gc3mk4,"I mean, those are the ones that I could think off the top of my mind but I'm sure there's more."
1564,2020-05-02 11:01:15,gc3mk4,"Cool. Interesting take, thanks for sharing. I actually thought the same of Tom Hardy like someone else mentioned but I thought both performances in The Revenant were brilliant."
1565,2020-05-02 10:05:48,gc3mk4,"Perhaps I should be more specific. Yes, what the character is going through in shutter island is a lot of doubt and fear, but that’s not what I am talking about. DiCaprio is not believable as a hard nose Boston ww2 vet/cop. Even before his character is questioning himself DiCaprio is trying so fucking hard (“we are dually appointed federal marshals!”) 

It’s fine to show fear and uncertainty; any of the actors I listed would be completely believable exhibiting those emotions while also making me believe that background/attitude/how they carry themselves."
1566,2020-05-03 07:15:13,gc3mk4,"No one is going to agree that there are other actors who could have done his roles better? Lol. Cause he was just so good you couldnt even IMAGINE someone else in the role?

I have met probably 5 film people who agree with me and have imaginations. They can envision another actor in a role; crazy, I know...

Aviator isn’t a badass, but he is playing a more gruff, 40’s masculine type (that Bogart, Paul Newman, etc naturally display). DiCaprio comes off like a teenager dressing up like what he thinks a stern, masculine, businessman is supposed to be for the time. It’s almost a caricature."

1675,2020-05-02 03:40:43,gbx7kd,"Answer: It's the Pizzagate/QAnon conspiracy. You can learn about it by reading up on Wikipedia or something, but the general gist of it is that it is a right wing conspiracy stating the the global 'elite' (aka liberals) of the world are involved in a massive child sex/slave trafficking ring for various nefarious purposes. Ranging from just having sex with children to torturing the children to drink their blood in satanic rituals and get high off it.

It's a conspiracy theory, there is no proof of the accusations and any time you see twitter or instagram comments being spammed about a celebrity being a pedophile and just googling their name doesnt immediately give you a Top News ""holy shit tom hanks was found with child porn"" kinda deal, it's just believers of this theory rearing their head again.

Tom Hanks in particular is a target right now because a few factors, one he went on self quarantine when Covid started and the believers said he was under 'house arrest while being investigated for his role in it' and two a small time actor who believed the conspiracy directly accused Hanks in an instagram video shortly before killing himself. If you search 'Tom Hanks' in the subreddit you'll see like at least 5 other threads. Search pedophile and you'll see other celebrities accused as well, all with the same answer

literally feels like it's TS1 and buzz was just brought back from the store.

&#x200B;

it's also so contrived and arbitrary, because they could've easily had him make those decisions on his own... plus if he had made all those decisions by himself, it would've shown more character/emotion."

1711,2020-05-02 05:47:23,gbkxoq,"Toy Story 4 was a cash grab

Forky is stupid, if a child can create a toy from a spork then ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE. Also, a child wouldn't care that much about a 'toy' spork. And Bonnie's parents are spineless for staying longer all for a stupid spork.

Buzz was stupid, literally they wrote him to be an idiot and that's just annoying and pointless.

Woody is all about sticking with his kid, and now he's ditching all of that for an eternity without being played with and having to hide in the shadows? No. That completely undoes everything he's about in the past 3 movies. ""You got a friend in me""...until I decide to chase the ladies then you're on your own.

AND DONT GET ME STARTED ABOUT HOW WOODY AND BUZZ >!SPLIT UP WITHOUT A SECOND THOUGHT, BONNIE CARES ABOUT THIS DUMB SPORK SHE MADE LITERALLY YESTERDAY BUT NOT AN ACTUAL TOY?!!<

And the previous 3 movies were wrapped up so well, The first and last one started and ended with a shot of the same cloud wallpaper in Andy's room if you didn't notice. :)

Andy is a parent now looking in a thrift store when he spots Woody. He then goes and tracks down Bonnie and decides to kill her John Wick style for first not caring about ""her cowboy"" and then losing Woody.

I'll admit it won't be rated G or even PG but who cares. The people who grew up with Woody and Buzz orginally (before 2000) deserved a better ending than the forth movie and to an extent the third movie."

I gave up on Pixar sometime ago, Monsters University, Finding Dory, Incredibles 2...Like they've increasingly become about sequels but the sequels kept getting worse and Toy Story did so much damage to a trilogy that's was a beacon of quality and one of the few rare trilogies that hold up.

Disney doesn't care of course which is sad. They haven't been doing better and as a whole I'm over most mainstream animated films. Toy Story 4 is possibly the worst film Pixar has made for me because it isn't just poorly written and contrived, but it had to go ahead and damage what came before. It looks great and has good voice acting but that's about it. The trend isn't going to stop, they aren't stopping at 4 when it made so much. Oh well."

1831,2020-05-01 22:55:42,gbkxoq,"The one thing that pissed me off in this otherwise amazing movie, is that Buzz and Woody were robbed of their final outing together. Toy story 4 should have been about the boys."
1832,2020-05-02 03:05:37,gbkxoq,"Honestly he played a small role, but Jesse got super did dirty. The previous movies make her out to be one of the main characters, but she does almost nothing the entire movie."
1833,2020-05-02 02:14:30,gbkxoq,I don’t know why they made him more of a dimwitted character with his whole “inner voice” schtick
1834,2020-05-01 23:08:08,gbkxoq,I think I read somewhere that he was cut a lot from the film due to Tim Allen being a not so great dude irl or something along those lines
1835,2020-05-01 21:56:42,gbkxoq,They constantly find ways to reset him in some way because I don’t think they can figure out anything too interesting for him without recalling the first movie.
1836,2020-05-01 19:48:52,gbkxoq,sorry?
1837,2020-05-01 23:20:31,gbkxoq,"That may be it. It’s strange, though. It doesn’t appear as if anything scandalous happened. It’s hard to believe they’d write off Buzz so easily when he has to be their best selling product. In fact, a lot of Andy’s OG collection are extremely lucrative. The idea that Pixar would dump them all  because some guy was hard.m to work with is hard to believe."
1838,2020-05-01 20:22:59,gbkxoq,Just because he’s a conservative doesn’t mean he’s an asshole
1839,2020-05-02 09:43:38,gbkxoq,Then Bonnie's soul gets reïncarnated in Bo Peep and becomes Woody's bride.
1840,2020-05-01 23:21:48,gbkxoq,Yeh the hitler salute was a bit much. Almost left the theatre
1841,2020-05-02 05:45:04,gbkxoq,You sure? It’s hard to sit through woody putting on that outfit and burning a cross on of Duke Caoom’s lawn
1842,2020-05-02 15:48:50,gbkxoq,"I upvoted because I'm just as clueless. What makes it worse it that I did watch it.

-4 karma or so is nothing though. Don't worry about that."
1843,2020-05-01 17:38:33,gbkxoq,"Not even close. This movie was unnecessary and honestly just disappointingly disrespectful of its original audience for a shitty cash grab at the next. Toy story 3 had heart, reasoning behind it and it completed an arc from my childhood. It gave me closure, made me feel like the series that defined my childhood was loved. The creators wanted the grown, leaving for college kids to know that things come full circle and it's okay to move on from your youth. This ripped away that closure and took away everything dear to my hear about this series. Buzz and Woody split up without a second thought, Woody is *the* most hated toy, and 99% of the movie reminds me of a video-game fetch quest that is so low stakes and predictable that you're not even invested in the end.

This movie was ***only*** made out of greed. There was nothing else to tell in this story and the fact that they made shit up for the money shows you Pixar's priorities"
1844,2020-05-02 00:24:27,gbkxoq,"I’d say Toy Story 2, Toy Story 3, Toy Story, Toy Story 4 but I think they’re all great. The ending of 4 is hard to accept though"
1845,2020-05-01 22:45:59,gbkxoq,"Nah, it was pretty decent."

1853,2020-05-02 00:28:39,gbkxoq,"Because it completely negates the first and second movie, two of which I watched throughout my childhood and understood as an adult. Two dedicated movies showcasing Woody and Buzz's friendship and it all gets thrown out when Woody parts the group for a woman."

1861,2020-05-02 03:17:45,gbkxoq,I think he did. It's highly likely because Tim Allen is a vocal conservative. Absolutely bonkers to do that to him.
1862,2020-05-02 02:48:32,gbkxoq,Are you guys silly? I'm still gonna send it.
1863,2020-05-01 22:15:55,gbkxoq,Oh we gon git it

1865,2020-05-02 09:40:36,gbkxoq,"He had gotten his own tv show, not enough?"
1866,2020-05-02 02:17:16,gbkxoq,I mean most of the gang sat in Andy’s room during the first movie
1867,2020-05-02 00:22:30,gbkxoq,Woody really ditched his boys for some pussy
1868,2020-05-02 02:28:09,gbkxoq,"If you think about it Buzz has the same kind of arc as the others that's why he's in a background some. Buzz is still cool and won't be going through what Woody is going through. Woody is an obsolete toy and very soon no one will want him, that's why it was more about him.

You'd want it to be more about them but Woody and Buzz aren't the ""same"" in a lot of ways and besides their strong friendship it's hard to find a way to place them together equally and have them develop from it. Buzz is not as conflicted with his place in the world the way Woody has always been."
1869,2020-05-02 04:34:41,gbkxoq,"I loved this movie too, and the emotional beats hit me hard. But yeah, the Buzz and Woody dynamic was totally neglected. The “to infinity, and beyond” ending fell flat for me. I was more emotional when Gabby Gabby was finally chosen by a kid."
1870,2020-05-01 23:54:13,gbkxoq,If that's true then they shot themselves in the foot. Both buzz and woody were always the central characters and 4 felt off without him.
1871,2020-05-02 00:41:53,gbkxoq,“Not so great dude” = conservative
1872,2020-05-01 19:54:28,gbkxoq,Yo.. u/iceman9161 how is tim allen am asshole?! I loved that dude! Could you shed some light on the situation for someone like me that hasn't seen or heard from him in like 10 years
1873,2020-05-01 19:53:32,gbkxoq,"Translation for the Reddit speak: Tim Allen supports Trump and is right wing, therefore he is bad"

1875,2020-05-02 02:36:20,gbkxoq,"He supports trump, wants to say the n word, and used to transport cocaine"
1876,2020-05-01 21:35:42,gbkxoq,"Yes, but he is both. Also u/Iceman9161 didn't say anything about him being a conservative, just an asshole, either you're conflating the two or are misdirecting your comment at ice even though it was others mentioning Tim's political affiliation"

And thanks!"
1881,2020-05-01 18:00:23,gbkxoq,Is this a copypasta? Because this would be a great one if it wasn't one.
1882,2020-05-01 20:43:50,gbkxoq,I actually did like the movie but I 100% agree with what you are saying. It should never have been made and it sullies the series.
1883,2020-05-01 21:41:30,gbkxoq,"""This ripped away that closure and took away everything dear to my hear about this series.""  


Andy still gave away Woody. That all still happened. 4 isn't a movie about Woody and Buzz it's about Woody and Forky (and to a lesser extent Gabby and Bo) and understanding that Woody has more than a singular purpose in life that being Andy/Bonnie and that he can move on with his life and be with Bo. Instead he hands of the reigns to Bonnie's favorite toy Jessie and goes on to live his weird toy life where he can be free and not forever looking out for Bonnie cause like Buzz says she's going to be okay. Is the movie perfect? Nope but none of the original trilogy are either, and that's fine but to say that this wasn't mad to tell a story is kind of disingenuous.   


Also Toy Story 4 was being written since before Toy Story 3 came out so it's not as much of a cash grab as you think."
1884,2020-05-01 22:34:49,gbkxoq,"Toy Story 4 has issues but it's far from the soulless money grab you describe. There's plenty of heart. The villian is incredibly well realized, the dummies are terrifying, the stuff with Bo Peep and Woody are great. Some really great work from Tony Hale. It really isn't that bad.

There's plenty of dumb stuff. Key and Peele seem out of place in my opinion as much as I love them. They REALLY push the ""can't be seen by people"" trope to the very edge. Buzz is completely wasted. But it still mostly works.

Also I'll never understand the ""didn't NEED to be made"" argument. Has there ever been a film in history that needed to be made?"
1885,2020-05-01 19:49:26,gbkxoq,"Damn, this is really well written, I agree with you mate"
1886,2020-05-01 21:19:35,gbkxoq,I really disliked everything but the ending of Toy Story 4.
1887,2020-05-02 00:55:11,gbkxoq,"I think Toy Story 4 is kind of a natural extension of the previous 3. Toy Story has always been a search for meaning and belonging, and the first three are increasingly nuanced ways of finding your value in what you give to others. 

Toy Story 1 Woody learns that Andy will still like him, Toy Story 2 Woody realizes that Andy will probably outgrow him eventually but to enjoy the good times, and Toy Story 3 that happens and he learns to move on and find someone else.

Toy Story 4 is kind of about moving past living for other people and learning to live for yourself. Kinda. Idk.

I think a lot of people hate it because it reveals the Toy Story 3 happy ever after isn't really happy ever after."
1888,2020-05-01 20:20:00,gbkxoq,"Who calm down, he said Toy Story 4, not Incredibles 2."
1889,2020-05-01 22:07:32,gbkxoq,"Honestly, as an epilogue it worked. It was like the “Far From Home” of the Toy Story series, just so we could see our favorite characters one last time and see the results of Andy giving up his toys. I do agree that 3 was still better though"

1891,2020-05-02 12:16:47,gbkxoq,i dont think 5 years spent animating is a cash grab
1892,2020-05-01 22:18:57,gbkxoq,"First of all it’s pretty funny that despite what you claim is Toy Story 3’s message, you’re still seething over a perfectly good sequel that’s pretty detached from the others. I thought it was ok to move on from your childhood? Lmao. This “reee my childhood is being destroyed” rhetoric is tired and pathetic. Is it so hard to imagine that this story is as valuable to others (kids, parents dealing with children leaving the nest, etc) as the college story was for you? 

Secondly, stop using video game terminology to talk about plot. It’s not a one to one comparison and it’s an extremely reductive and shallow criticism. Fetch quests are loathed in games cause they’re low effort filler, not because they’re about finding something. A plot about finding something if done well (it was) is as good as finding someone, going somewhere, doing something, whatever. It’s irrelevant. Toy Story 2 was a massive fetch quest cash grab by your logic, but you seem staunch in the position that those first 3 movies were greedless and faultless."
1893,2020-05-02 02:40:58,gbkxoq,Yep you are 100% correct.  The third movie ended perfectly.  That ending was so good.
1894,2020-05-02 11:27:07,gbkxoq,"Loved 4, better than the third one and the first one don’t @ me"
1895,2020-05-01 21:50:44,gbkxoq,"This is why I didnt even bother watching It. Toy Story 3 was the perfect send off. All loose ends were tied, and the ending had me feeling emotional for days. Was one of the best endings to a series ever. Somehow I knew they’d end up screwing it up. Fuck Disney up its fat greedy ass"
1896,2020-05-01 21:43:29,gbkxoq,I felt the same way. I wish I had more upvotes to give.
1897,2020-05-01 21:51:30,gbkxoq,"It wasn't a bad movie, but compared to the previous 3, it felt like a direct to DVD sequel with a little bit more effort put in."

Toy Story 3 is the only one I would call a “good” movie. The others are great. 2 is my favorite (wow what a complete movie), followed by 1, then 4, then 3. For me, what makes 4 better than 3 is that 4 had more heart than 3. 3 always felt to me like a prison break movie that happened to throw in a heart tugging ending. 4 introduces such a serious finality to the whole conversation of toys and woodys place in the world.
I’m also a sucker for a love story and in the end the one thing that makes woody realize he can choose his own happiness over that of his child’s is that he realizes he is no longer in the best position to help his child. He can choose himself. It’s the captain America ending but it’s more believable.
I never felt that in regards to Toy Story 3, plus it felt to me that Andy was giving Bonnie a gift that she would never appreciate the gravity of.

Because Andy gave Woody to Bonnie, his most treasured connection to his childhood, and asked her to take care of him. He trusted her. He thought he was passing on a toy that had cared for him for years, and giving him to her meant that Andy too could move on with his life. Woody had come full circle and had parted ways, but it was ok because now he could love and be loved by a new child. 

And she replaced him with a fucking spork. A used spork at that. Even Forky knew that he belonged in the trash. 

How dare she. She made the ending and character arc of 3 meaningless. Woody would have been better going to college with Andy and then being passed down to his own kids. Woody would have continued to be loved because Andy would have treasured him no matter who had him. I still treasure my favourite toys and I'm almost 30. So Woody learning to let go ended up being pointless and his arc moves from being bittersweet to just disappointing.

Bonnie sucks.

2022,2020-05-02 01:46:10,gbkxoq,"> Toy story was about selflessness and being able to sacrifice for the ones you love the most...which was Andy

I disagree. I'd say toy story is all about growing up, and the changes that brings in life. The toys constantly struggle with being loved as Andy grows up, loses interest or gets new toys, and they have to find new ways to stay close to the ones they love - to each other and to Andy.

But by the time toy story 3 ends, the toys know that they can't rely on Andy to always be the same as he was as a child, and that that's ok. At the end, the toys are hopeful, but they have also lost the one person they've modelled their whole life around, the person they were always struggling for.

So then, toy story 4 is about how the toys find a new life, and grow up themselves.

I find it really interesting in toy story 4 how there is now a real internal conflict in the toys, especially Woody. The toys now have connections to more than just their owner, and they have to make difficult choices about where they want their own lives to go. In the first three movies the toys always wanted to get back to Andy, so this is something I don't think we've seen before."

No the ending of 3 is about Andy's emotion. Even if she threw Woody in the trash 5 minutes later that feeling Andy had about passing on, moving on and transitioning still matters.

I'm no D&D apologist they fucked the end of the show. HOWEVER they did actually complete it which is more than you can say for George and I dont believe we will ever see the end of the books. 

I can't say not completing it trumps doing a shoddy job but actually finishing it. Furthermore if he had got off his ass and finished the books they would have had a blueprint to complete it, so I really don't understand why George gets to dodge culpability in the end result of the show.

That being said they should have given the show at least another season to pan all these plot points out so everything isn't so fucking rushed."

100%. I dont blame HBO at all. D&D didn't want to do it anymore and rushed it. Fuck them forever for that. 

But also, I'm glad they made probably 5 seasons of near perfect television and a 6th that's still overall pretty great before shitting the bed. I'll take that over nothing.

We are in 100% agreement on this, except for Jaimie, fuck that ending for him in any world.

 I'm fine with Daenerys going mad in fact I think the seeds were even somewhat laid for this in season 2 on, and I think COULD be an incredibly powerful story. 

Someone who feels they are more principled,  most reasonable, most powerful, most morale, and willing to do the right thing is incredibly likely to become an authoritarian.

2072,2020-05-01 17:43:04,gbidtr,"In my own experience, coercive religious groups (and honestly QAnonsense counts at this point) have far more in common with each other than they have with (say) the supposed theological systems they're based out of.

Yes, this means groups like the [New Apostolic Reformation, Scientology](https://www.dailykos.com/story/2006/10/3/253028/-Dominionism-as-a-coercive-religious-movement-part-2), QAnonsense, ""UFOer"" cults, cults of personality, MLM ""business motivational orgs"", and so on have FAR more in common with each other than (say) the New Apostolic Reformation has with more mainline forms of Christianity like the local Methodist or Catholic churches down the street.

Essentially all cults can be said to have a common core of Coercive Tactics, of Undue Influence.  There's several different models that have come about (including the [BITE Model](https://freedomofmind.com/bite-model/), the [Eight Criteria of Thought Reform](https://www.openmindsfoundation.org/the-basics-liftons-eight-criteria-of-thought-reform/), the [Continuum of Influence and Persuasion](http://www.cultrecover.com/sites/default/files/pdfs/CONTINUUM_INFLUENCE.pdf), etc.) but they ALL have in common a list of common tactics coercive religious groups take to control their members no matter the particular theological ""window dressings"".

(Ironically, this is ALSO how you can have groups as disparate as UFOers (who promote a ""War in Heaven"" narrative involving the Master Race From Outer Space versus evil *V*\-esque Alien Nazi Lizards), Theosophy promoters, actual racist-right types (including Christian Identity), New Apostolic Reformation types, and general ""Conspiracy Cargo Cult"" types *all* promoting QAnonsense; there's enough of a common core of ""Conspiracy Theology"" and undue persuasion that in truth they have enough in common that a ""Grand Unified Conspiracy Theory"" can come easily into play, along with QAnonsense-specific thought-terminating cliches and loading the language and so on.)"

Basically, since believers in the theory want to talk about it all day, convince others of their beliefs, and “mainstream” their violent worldview they target as many well-liked and successful celebrities as they can. They pour over whatever public life these people have online, hunt for anything they can spin as “suspicious,” and take advantage of media curiosity about the people they target to have a steady stream of quotes, photographs, and personal relationships for them to use as props in their wild and defamatory stories.

They went after Hanks sometime around when Harvey Winesteen’s real and long rumored bad behavior came to trial. They knew people would read one story and find the fictional one they spun along side it more plausible."
2085,2020-05-01 00:43:31,gb6m7h,"Maybe it’s way of testing how deep people can be drawn into believing the unbelievable.

As I recall there were 300 something matches for Interloper and 500/600 or something like that on lower difficulties. Plus the maglense(s) and the fire strikers, then you also have the option of using a flare so there are dozens of those too. 

If people use torches to start fires, then you don't waste matches failing when your fire starting skill is low and eventually you have an abundance.  Also as you get your skills up and better clothes you're not needing fires as often, so while you use a lot of matches to begin with you end up only using one a week (or the alternatives) to make a bunch of water / cook that moose etc."

Every new feature they add makes a game I fell in love with for the challenge even easier.  Adding an infinite ignition source that doesn't even restrict you to needing a sunny day will make it the equivalent of a toddler toy."

2250,2020-06-26 13:38:48,hfv3bd,"Off the top of my head:

Marilyn Monroe in Bus Stop, Some Like it Hot and The Seven Year Itch. She was a much better actress than anyone (even herself) gave her credit for. She was never nominated for an Oscar.

Alan Rickman was never nominated, either, which is criminal. He never fails to give an outstanding performance. I loved him him in Harry Potter and a lesser-known film, Bottleshock.

Meg Ryan in When Harry Met Sally (never nominated for an Oscar)

R. Lee Ermey in Full Metal Jacket

Sidney Poitier in In the Heat of the Night

Guy Peace in Momento (outstanding performance but I still can't figure out this movie)

Robert DeNiro in The King of Comedy

Gene Kelly in Singing in the Rain

2251,2020-06-26 17:37:21,hfv3bd,James Cagney not being nominated for *White Heat* (1949) is the biggest snub that I can think of. He also deserved a nomination for his role in *The Public Enemy* (1931).

2253,2020-06-26 00:45:29,hfv3bd,Krieps is just as good as DDL in Phantom Thread and still didn’t get it. So overlooked.

2255,2020-06-26 00:12:10,hfv3bd,BV is Gosling's career best performance imo. He definitely should've gotten a nom for that.
2256,2020-06-25 23:40:31,hfv3bd,Stephen Graham was totally the underrated MVP of The Irishman. Shame that he would never have been nominated as they were going to push for the bigger names.

I believe it was her grandfather, herself, and little child all drowned in an above ground pool. All 3. Same time drown. She happened to handle the money for a Gates foundation company. Hmm coincidence?"
2290,2020-06-26 19:07:26,hfsdxa,That's a skit from Jimmy Kimmel poking fun at how fucked up child patents are. You're taking it out of context.

2298,2020-06-25 18:52:24,hfrjvf,"It got panned pretty badly by critics on release but I rather enjoyed it. As with most movies, the build up was better than the resolve but I thought Emma Watson and Tom Hanks gave good performances.

I get the Black Mirror vibes are strong throughout, however I sense that we're far closer to that level of 24hr broadcasting then most near-future episodes.

It reminded me a little of a much darker version of EdTV. Would recommend it though as it's much better then the reviews I've read give it credit for."
2299,2020-06-25 22:08:04,hfrjvf,"I watched it two days ago. Thought it was promesing, but lost the wow-ability at the ending. Didn't feel that ""I didn´t think of that"" ending that I did/and still do with most black mirror episodes. The Circle was more.. ""I was hoping she wouls say/do this. And she did"". Didn't read anything of it before watching and liked it until the ending."

There are some things in common between this film and the serie, but Black Mirror is something that you won't easily forget: it gave me chills while watching it and it gives me chills even now when I think about some episodes. I haven't felt the same way watching The Circle instead.

I don't know guys, maybe I am biased in some way because I am emotionally attracted to Black Mirror,  but that's my opinion. I liked Tom Hanks' performance though.✌"
2302,2020-06-26 00:16:45,hfrjvf,I personally didn't like it that much but I found a movie called Circle on Netflix that was much more interesting to me. It also has some strong Black Mirror vibes and the ending was way more satisfying than The Circle's ending.

The concept and actors were interesting enough to keep me engaged though. John Boyega was underused IMO opinion though.   

I was also expecting a more epic showdown between Emma Watson’s character and Tom Hanks and Patton Oswalts’ characters. The ending Felt anti-climatic."
2308,2020-06-25 22:21:21,hfrjvf,"Haha I totally agree. The Circle was enjoyable, but pretty predictable and not shocking at all a la Black Mirror. They could’ve done more with the premise"

Trump has been secretly fighting this global network with the help of JFK Jr., who faked his death to escape the network (no, really.) 

The mysterious source behind all of this kept hinting at big things happening on specific dates. When those dates came and went with no big events in public, that means they must have happened in private. Which means Trump has been waging this war, in secret for some reason, with military tribunals and clandestine executions!

One of the latest attacks from the globalists has been spreading a fake virus (sometimes it's a real virus ""they"" created in a lab, and sometimes there is no virus and ""they"" are faking the whole thing.) 

Since Tom Hanks was one of the highest profile celebrities to get the virus, and he isn't a fanboy of Trump, that means he's in on it! And since he hasn't been seen in public for a while that means he's been secretly tried by Trump's tribunals and was executed (not that Hollywood public appearances are scant right now due to the virus and Hanks is a notoriously private individual.)

Heavy Breathing might be a totally normal band, [but Majestic Ape from the band should not be allowed to perform at a pizza place that is kid friendly after comments like this](https://youtu.be/3JZAsfjOloo)

It's such a liberal show that follows terrible human beings and the whole joke is whether it's more wrong to play a black character in blackface or as a white guy (both are played as wrong and offensive).

But then it actually happened, at least one of the episodes was pulled.  It's like a joke, we're not just sweeping history under the rug but also the satire that exposes why that history was bad..."

It's crazy the amount of episodes that are being removed or censored lately.  Never thought that the Michael Jackson episode of The Simpsons would be among them either.

If anything, I think some sort of intro (like what they've now done for Gone with the Wind) could be added, but really, that's not even necessary in this case. The whole *point* of those segments in the episodes is that the characters or writers *in the show* are being horribly offensive.

In my mind, it's similar to removing an editorial about how blackface, because it discusses blackface."

I think theres a tiny teeny group of people who are offended, then a bunch of bots and trolls on twitter trying to make it a thing, then a bunch of bandwagoners seeing the trolls and bots and thinking “maybe I should be mad too”

Theres a huge difference between an obviously ridiculous character doing this and me watching lawrence of arabia the other day and noticing all the arabs were white guys painted brown, which shouldn’t be taken down either by the way.

Edit: Also theres a part of me thats like “Come on we know the difference! Context people!” But these last few weeks show that a lot of people don’t know a lot of racial history so yeah, I dunno its a [tough one](https://i.imgur.com/EPdZ2Js.gif)."

Yes, the joke is that is is horribly offensive but people lived through that. It is a bit more complicated because yes (referring to S03E02) Tracy and Jane are in reverse 'skins,' and I'm sure Tracy didn't get jobs because he's black, Jane got paid less because she's a woman, so they're making fun of themselves, but through each other. So complicated. But its better/easier to just not even go into that territory. 

I just always go by the general rule - you can make fun of you. I can make fun of me. But you can't make fun of me unless I let you.

With that said - yes, I'm on team - Don't make these episodes in the future, but make clear disclaimers at the beginning. Reteach history, don't erase it."

Children don't know they are exposed to things they shouldn't be. If a child grows up around racism regularly they can easily grow up and become racist because it is normal to them, it isn't something that stands out. That is how most racism or other bigotry spreads, people thinking it is normal and not a big deal."

It’s about a man who is ready to commit suicide, and an angel comes and shows him what life for those around him would be like if he had never existed. It has some very sweet/funny/touching parts in it. My mother watches it ever year at Christmas time...they always play it on network tv around the holidays.

Would *American Beauty* be a good one? It seems very 4 to me. I loved it when I was younger and watched it several times, but I haven’t seen it in years."
2632,2020-06-24 05:46:26,heuhbx,"I think Portrait of a Lady on Fire is a very 4 movie. It's a beautiful film about forbidden love, longing, and art. Amelie is a great movie too, as well as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind."

2636,2020-06-24 13:06:07,heuhbx,"Who THE FUCK is hating on fours? 

I feel like all signs have the stereotypes we can poke fun about (fours are angsty flower children, eights are edge lord supremes, ones are cops, nines are stoners, whatever) but anyone who legitimately tries to say they dislike one personality or another needs to stfu. Sometimes I feel like people forget the point of the enneagram, it’s not to categorize people into neat little boxes, it’s meant to help us break out of harmful patterns. There are people in every number that I like and people I don’t like because, crazy, we’re still all different people. 

That being said, yeah I think some types are over represented in movies, especially depending on genre. 6s and 8s in action movies, super disintegrated ones as the annoying boss/parent/whatever in comedy, 3s in kids movies (idk maybe?). I think 4s and 7s make for really good coming of age stories. 

I also think that kids shouldn’t seriously settle on a type. I don’t have any data for this, but I feel like kids gravitate towards the more archetypical numbers. I was certain I was a 7 as a kid, but I just have ADHD. Most kids are looking for an identity, that doesn’t mean they’re 4s. There’s just so much mental health stuff, growth, change in all parts of life,etc, that happens before the age of 20-30. Don’t get me wrong, I won’t argue with anyone about their type, but I feel like it’s just bad to form an identity around a type (ever, but especially) if you’re still young. 

Also, I’m not arguing with your interpretations of the movie types. Ladybird is SUCH a four lol."

The movie is literally about someone getting out of his shell, learning to express yourself, finding your own way in life. Type 4 is not a wallflower at all and they don't need to learn to express themself. Charlie is also extremely conflict avoidant."

Great point about overgeneralizing! The reason it doesn’t apply to this post is because I’m taking it from a “If you are a 4, you might enjoy these movies”, rather than a “If you enjoy these movies because of their finding yourselves themes, you might be a 4”. It’s not about kids finding their types, but about any 4 on this subreddit who’s looking for movie recs. Hope that made sense!"

2652,2020-06-24 13:06:35,heuhbx,"That’s a bit unnecessary. If you think it’s a 9ish movie then that’s great. It doesn’t have to be in a single category though. Getting so technical about media kind of takes the enjoyment out of them for me. You aren’t a 4 so you don’t have total authority over this, sure you’ve probably read about them but that’s different from actually being one (just as I can’t speak on 9 topics). “Type 4” isn’t a single entity and has many facets, just as any personality."
2653,2020-06-25 02:33:21,heuhbx,"""We accept the love we think we deserve""

You may not think its a 4 movie, but this is a four quote for sure.  I related before I even related to being a 4 (or knew what enneagram types were, rather).  It is a reccurring theme in the relationships throughout the movie, its like what all the characters have to come to terms with in their own way.

Also, this is a great song regarding the theme

2655,2020-06-24 12:41:49,heuhbx,"I never said that the characters are.4s themselves or that it’s exactly a 4ish movie, just that I connected with it as a 4. The longing to find oneself and the internal struggle between watching the world go by from the sidelines and actively participating in life felt very real. Also, I think that the intensely emotional experience of feeling “infinite” is something many 4s can relate to. Media doesn’t have to fit exactly into a specific mold to be enjoyed by certain personality types."

Of course you can still relate to it and like it as a 4, I also like and relate to movies about Lara Croft, even though I'm far from being like her. But calling it a 4ish movie is just a bit off."

2665,2020-06-24 12:47:08,heuhbx,"You said that the movies you listed have Type 4 characters or Type 4 movie scenes, so I guessed you meant that regarding the movies you list.

Infinity is more a theme for Type 9 tho. 4s are usually hyper-fixated on some kind of emotion or emotional/mental state at a time. For example David Bowie, who was hyper-fixated on isolation and even moved to L.A to feel even more isolated. Type 9 usually related to everything and feels ""everything and nothing""."

2668,2020-06-24 15:49:17,heuhbx,"Haha that makes sense!! (the turned inside out part) I think I might be so drawn to my 4 friends is because they manage to be emotional and “hippy dippy” while not being weak. Maybe the inverse is true because 8s are more repulsed by insincerity then by weirdness. 

Couldn’t Heathers as a movie also be seen as a revenge fantasy gone wrong? It’s an 8 trying to gain power and control and everything spirals. If I remember right she even moves to 5 in the middle of the movie, withdrawing into herself, then at the end moves more to two with her childhood friend Martha. Wow... all this is dawning on me now, it’s literally a cautionary tale for 8s."
2669,2020-06-24 13:21:16,heuhbx,This seems like gatekeeping to me. Things like Charlie’s connection to music seem 4ish to me but I don’t really have to explain that to you. There’s no reason to be unnecessarily nit picky about this. Mistyping as a 4 doesn’t make you a 4. I mistyped as a 5 for some time and I can speak from the perspective of one because I’m not actually a 5.

Wasn't he just really into music and enjoying all the emotions and memories and feeling like his music was very special and giving it to Sam and stuff? While that could be 4ish,  that could be any sensitive and emotional type. I don't really see a correlation with image or reactivity here."

And yea sure, that's true. Every type can feel infinite under the right circumstances."
2676,2020-06-24 13:42:41,heuhbx,"Charlie was particularly obsessed with Asleep by The Smiths, he seemed addicted to its melancholy as many 4s can be addicted to a particular emotion and go to lengths to prolong those feelings. He even put it on Sam’s mixtape twice. I’m not saying this is exclusively a 4 thing but many of us can relate to it. I don’t think you’re understanding that. There’s no need to be so fixated on semantics, we’re all here to grow and share our experiences. Please refrain from gatekeeping!"

This is literally just a fun post about movies dude, so I don’t get why you feel so inclined to pull it apart and discredit it. Stop. Gatekeeping. There honestly seems to be a gatekeeping epidemic going on right now, or maybe it was always there. You aren’t the Master of the Enneagram so stop acting like it. Being so obsessed with semantics of the criteria ruins it. 

Of course I’m all up for healthy debate and discussion but I don’t think it’s warranted or relevant in a simple movie recommendation post to give people good movies to watch.

2701,2020-06-24 00:28:11,heqjju,He's Eddie bravo level retarded when it comes to conspiracy.

Fuck Sam and his protecting his own friends bullshit."
2703,2020-06-24 00:38:29,heqjju,He's a crazy person.
2704,2020-06-24 00:50:48,heqjju,"The “Tom Hanks is a pedo” was Qanon’s attempt to prove CoVid was a hoax and Pizzagate was real in one swipe. 
The theory goes that Tom Hanks never had CovID and he wasn’t quarantined. He was in jail because he was a pedophile and the deep state made him their scapegoat. 
I wish I was joking. Look in to it, b!"
2705,2020-06-24 01:02:18,heqjju,Tripoli is a mongoloid but I believe Tom Hanks is a legit creep tho. Anybody with the “good guy” public persona is always t-t-t-teeaaarable
2706,2020-06-24 00:43:23,heqjju,"I mean, what does anyone expect of Sam Tripoli? A rational well thought out response that demands all of us to search our souls and hold out judgment and reflect on what we’re really trying to accomplish with all of this? His brain so fried from coke abuse and other drugs that he probably doesn’t even know what day it is. Joey Diaz basically implied he was coked up one of the times he did The Church."
2707,2020-06-24 01:45:13,heqjju,"A actor named Isaac Kappy before committing suicide made an hour long video and a 2 page suicide note about some crazy shit. He said he was sorry for giving into the dark side and claimed Tom Hanks and others were involved in a pedophilia ring. It also links to Hanks’ Instagram  of random photos of kids stuff (single gloves,socks and shoes) abandoned in weird places ( road sides,beaches Route 66). It’s an insane conspiracy theory rabbit hole to go down."
2708,2020-06-24 04:02:26,heqjju,"I think he’s referring to two things. Isaac kappy, the actor who was killed/killed himself after claiming Tom hanks and many other famous people were pedophiles. And then there’s some woman who claims her father sold her as a sex slave to Tom hanks at 12 or something like that. Think her name is Sarah Ruth Ashcraft."
2709,2020-06-24 04:25:38,heqjju,Tripoli is a trogladite mouth breathing assclown.

2717,2020-06-24 00:43:51,heqjju,That’s generous.
2718,2020-06-24 00:47:51,heqjju,"Yea, at least Alex Jones can spin a yarn and make it entertaining when he goes on about conspiracies. Tripoli and Bravo come across as people with some sort of mental deficiency like the people you’d find wearing rags on their feet in the corner store shouting about the government putting infertility drugs in the KFC fried chicken recipe."
2719,2020-06-24 01:56:36,heqjju,"Really, I would expect this from all the comics. The fact that Callen and Shob turned on him so fast indicates they already knew. Whitney just being silent for so long was her trying to figure a way out of this. They all should be talking like Tripoli if they truly did not know."

2727,2020-06-24 02:00:46,heqjju,"Yeah that’s fair enough, but I mean Sam sees a photo on Tom Hanks’ Instagram of one shoe and claims it’s proof of him being in the illuminati and involved in an international pedo ring. But when it comes to Chris it’s “where is the due process!?”"

Some generals, and some CIA agents for example could want to continue to feed the war machine in afghanistan. The president tries to take the troops out of afghanistan and intelligence officials release a ""story"" about russian bounties on american soldiers.

I will give you another example. Assange releases american war crimes in afghanistan. Assange gets a life of imprisonment and torture, not because he broke any legitimate laws but because he dared to question the military industrial complex.

So I don’t have a “scent”, I’m not particularly interesting, but I seem to be the center of intrigue for the majority of my extended family. Idk if it’s the fact that I’m the youngest or a culture thing (we’re Italian-American and what’s my business is everyone’s business whether I like it or not)

Because I’m grown, just graduated and employed I was finally free from their grasp... then you-know-what happened. I have one aunt that’s a rival. Idk the reasoning (maybe it’s because her kids suck) but she always has something to say about my life: how many credits I took in school, when I moved out, etc. She loves criticizing my other cousins too with their parenting styles and what not but she’s always been fixated on me. It doesn’t affect me; I of course usually do the opposite of her advice, but I do find it strange the amount of pull she thinks she has in my decision-making

But I digress. She’s made this a nightmare. 

Before “this”, I was working at a gym because my full-time job start date isn’t till 2021. Worries about CV were in the air and she sent me a bunch of texts about how I was gonna kill my mom (who’s in another state) by going to work. I recently found out she did this to a couple other relatives that they were gonna kill their SO/older family member by not quitting their job. Of course, she is still going to work.

Then, that crazy night came with the Utah Jazz players and Tom hanks and that Oval Office speech from POTUS. She creates a group text with me and my dad saying: “your trip to the UK is cancelled. Sorry” Despite the technicality that we still could fly there if we wanted, 1) you’re not the only one that can afford internet and cable, were aware it’s canceled and 2) how do you get off telling my dad whose been looking forward to this trip for years that his trip is cancelled?

Flash forward to now: things are starting to open. I also had a buddies weekend planned to go to Miami in March. We canceled and we’re planning to go this weekend. We aren’t going now because my friends job would require a two-week quarantine and he can’t afford that. Whatever. However, my aunt gets wind of the trip but doesn’t know it’s cancelled. She texts in the SAME group chat that my trip should be cancelled and provides a bunch of stats on cases and what not. To even leave the state, she said I need to two-week quarantine. Come to find out she’s been to at least 5-6 states since this started. Moving her two kids and even taking a weekend trip for herself.

So my dad and I agreed we’re gonna screw with her and he texted back that he’s still going and she’s not in control. She’s flipping out calling everyone trying to get an understanding of my plans (I don’t text her back for obvious reasons). She also got the idea that I’m fishing tomorrow with my 70-year old uncle and that has added to her tailspin. I have no plans to alleviate her anxiety. AITA?

2783,2020-06-22 19:38:12,hdydtg,I saw part of it. Maybe I am just not tuned to war movie Greatness. But I think I would think Dr. Strangelove was Great and definitely from what I've seen is better than what I've seen of Private Ryan. So no imo it's overdramatic trash and not Great.
2784,2020-06-22 20:19:16,hdydtg,Never saw the Green Mile. So maybe
2785,2020-06-22 19:35:36,hdydtg,Not imo. Lion King is Great. Aladdin is Great. But Toy Story anything hasn't been my consideration of Great.

2801,2020-06-22 23:39:54,hdydtg,I don’t know what to tell you then. Seems like the primary issue isn’t as much Tom Hanks as it is your shit taste in movies.

2807,2020-06-22 19:48:14,hdydtg,It's probably really good original form but when I saw it it kind of dragged and sucked and you figure there has to be a better real life ending than this for them.
2808,2020-06-22 20:39:18,hdydtg,Because everytime I've watched it for a few minutes I feel the intelligence bleeding out of my brain around my eyeballs. It is the lowest most base form of entertainment designed to numb the proliteriate and keep us from competing with the elite. Its quite effective.

2821,2020-06-22 15:16:13,hdtofe,"There is a lot of star power in this room.

On one side you have Tom Hanks who at the time was probably the biggest actor in the world, fresh off back to back Oscar wins and prior to probably his best movies (Apollo 13 and Saving Private Ryan-which he produces side projects off of in “From the Earth to The Moon” and “Band of Brothers”.

And on the other side, and for the younger people who only know of “Last Man Standing” Tim Allen, he was is in the middle of an eight year run in a top 10 family sitcom on ABC “Home Improvement”, fresh off The Santa Clause (190 million), and just prior to a string of up and down successful movies in 1997-99 (Jungle 2 Jungle, For Better or Worse, Toy Story 2, Galaxy Quest).

Their careers took different directions but it’s great when they get back together every decade or so to do another Toy Story"

2823,2020-06-26 06:02:59,hdrp9e,"I feel like, perhaps, the Grumps might have been burned a little by the ProJared situation. The subreddit was in a fervor about that, too, and the Grumps distanced themselves heavily from him - took down every video he had any involvement in. While people agreed they were right in doing that and showed support for Ross because Holly was involved in the situation, there were the assholes screaming at them for believing baseless accusations and taking down content without any real proof.

Then, eventually, Jared ended up not being a pedophile maybe? It seemed like his innocence got proven somewhere along the way and he went back to making Nintendo-based content, no harm, no foul. So all of the assholes screaming at the Grumps for trying to distance themselves from him got to be right.

Do you think people like that EVER shut up about being right?

This situation has the potential for the same kind of backlash. The people White Knighting for Ben that will do nothing but spam comment and email and absolutely any form of communication they can get with the Grumps to call bullshit on ""believing internet lies about Ben,"" even if his Twitter was the source of the evidence.

Ben's name has been removed as editor from every recent episode I've looked at since the latest Rocket League series and whether that means he was fired or they're just having him edit in shadow, I can't say. But, he's no longer mentioned by name or credited."
2824,2020-06-22 19:20:31,hdrp9e,"I appreciate this post. I thought about doing a post to this effect (though not NEARLY as comprehensive), but decided against it for a variety of reasons, so I’m glad someone did. 

In my very-not-expert opinion, I feel that if Ben were to be fired for anything, it would be for the way he handled this situation, not the accusations themselves, for which the only evidence in their favor is a few other tweets and little else. I don’t think Ben is a pedophile, but he was an absolute moron in his response to what may very likely be baseless accusations. All in all, the Game Grumps know him better than we do, and firing him during the current situation would be a logistical nightmare, so I agree with their response to this situation and commend them on their prudence."
2825,2020-06-22 20:41:58,hdrp9e,"Its more than just this ""joke"" though. Its the constant treating the fan base like they are stupid and never holding themselves accountable for anything. Endlessly white knight for them is pointless since they don't give two fucks about you."
2826,2020-06-23 06:50:56,hdrp9e,This needs stickied!
2827,2020-06-23 18:45:57,hdrp9e,"Hey guys. I'm writing this larger editorial in the comments. This one will express my personal opinion and should not be taken in context with the facts above. 

Full disclosure. At one point I was under the impression that a website called ""Kiwifarms"" was behind a flame war/attack on Ben's character. For context, Kiwifarms is a far right extremist site that has a history of bullying people until they kill themselves and encouraging hate/violence on minorities and disabled people. They've harassed people like the creator of ""Sonichu"" and various others they deem unworthy. The site's also been banned in multiple countries for doing things like publishing the christchurch shooter's ""manifesto."" 

They don't like Arin Hanson, or anyone who associates with him. My mistake. I feel like others would have thought the same.

Issue two I'd like to address. It's not as much an issue here as it is on other posts, but I'd like everyone to respect each other's opinions here. If someone says they feel like Ben should be responsible for the things he writes, I'd like everyone to respect that opinion and not ""fight"" about it. It's okay to have a discussion. Don't get personal. 

Third, it has come to my attention that many people on Twitter have been posting comments to Ben's page as well as other Game Grumps affiliated pages. Some of these comments are borderline threatening. 

This needs to stop.

I'm going to call out @WatchOutBen2 for this specifically. They write ""@PenisBailey
 since @egoraptor
 hasnt done anything, I've submitted the proof to your local police department, after speaking at length to a detective, he thinks we have a case. See you soon, my friend.""

This is unacceptable behaviour and I encourage people to report it anytime they see it. Saying these types of things is harassment and could amount to an uttering threats charge. 

Someone saying something like ""Ben, you really let me down with those comments,"" or something like that is obviously fine. It's the threatening and spamming people that need to be addressed. It's probably also the reason we're never going to see an official statement or another proper apology from anyone Grumps related. 

I am debating if I should put these kinds of comments in the story above because it seems like that would seriously skew the neutrality I'm going for here. I've had some teachers from college tell me I should, but I'm not sure it's relevant to the facts of the case. 

Let me know what you think.

Edit: I'll be doing a final update on this post shortly."
2828,2020-06-25 22:49:01,hdrp9e,"Through school I had a classmate I knew since 1st grade till the day I graduated. We had classes together and were in boy scouts together. He had a hard time fitting in. Didn't know how to make jokes. Often times he would take things too far. If we (my friend group) made any kind of toilet humor or sexual joke he would try to add to it and it was almost always unfunny and made everyone uncomfortable and annoyed.

2831,2020-06-22 16:07:01,hdrp9e,"Honestly, and I know I am probably going to get a lot of shit for this but, I kind of don’t care in this situation.


I don’t use/have Twitter or instagram so I don’t condone some people venting their frustrations because they see it more commonly and potentially feel upset.


The reason I don’t care is because it seems that these claims are focused on one kid, and that kid is Jacob Sartorius. 


I’m in my early 20s so I’m no stranger with the archetype the internet has branded a kid like Jacob. He’s just one of those “Justin Bieber boys” that are really popular with girls, especially young ones in the young teenage years, but gets roasted on by a lot of boys. They kind of get branded as pretty boys who aren’t cool.


There was plenty after Bieber but the targets of this type of low hanging fruit roasting comedy typically never stuck to certain Bieber clones since they either didn’t get that popular in comparison with a big female to male ratio or weren’t deemed as cringey. A couple of those that I personally remember would be like one direction, matty b raps, and of course Jacob himself.


I think Jacob got big on musically (tiktok) from being a young boy that little girls thought was cute which just made him the butt end for some jokes about how undeserving this kids access to fame and fortune was.


All you need to do is check Jacob’s heyday videos, such as [his sweatshirt song ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=IvxRsDpXPGo) and see how many dislikes and negative comments there are.


I will say that Ben definitely shouldn’t have kept roasting him since Jacob is pretty much irrelevant now, but at the same time Jacob is probably no stranger to hate.


I will definitely never come close to the fame that Jacob has and  he probably earned more money in his teenage years alone than I will ever see in my life, but he doesn’t need to be getting these online troll comments. Jacob peaked in his middle school to early high school years which is where boys are the absolute worst in giving rude comments. He probably got a bunch of shit but it’s should’ve been expected since there was the Bieber precedent.


At the end of it, from my thoughts at least, Jacob probably doesn’t care much about it since Ben has under 4 thousand followers on twitter while Jacob has over a million. There have been more relevant people who have roasted him before, possibly in a more respectful manner and with better comedy too- [my personal favorite](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6qP-sG69TJc).


I honestly think that this was just an outdated form of comedy that I never really cared about or thought was funny. Just like those old James Gunn tweets that were just lame jokes that tried to be edgy and funny commenting on something like Bieber.


All I can say is moving forward he should refrain from making these type of comments or posts. As a result of this it seems like he will interject himself less into the videos. This basically makes it more of a faceless editor style that I believe the people who already didn’t like Ben more satisfied in comparison to business as usual


I think that’s all I really have to say about this but I think by now my thoughts are, just like making fun of the Justin Bieber of a generation, irrelevant and probably has been said before in a better manner."

You are absolutely not ""reporting on the facts"" - you're pretending to be neutral when in reality you're taking aim. Essentially your starting point is the 11-1 jury at the start of Twelve Angry Men.

You're taking something to ""trial"" when a trial shouldn't be necessary. If the ""victim"" here is quiet, it's either because it's too small for him to care, too much of a joke for him to respond, or he's already tackled the issue with his OWN legal counsel (in that case, usually people are discouraged from engaging further, so legal teams can do their jobs properly). In which case, you can bet your ass Ben wouldn't be allowed to respond, either. People would have reached out to him. But guess what? Not an issue, didn't happen.

You haven't thought about the real world application of law or accusation at all, and you're being willfully ignorant of the fact that this is being blown out of proportion from every angle. Fuck you. Go away."

My girlfriend and I have been together for about 5 years. She has always had an issue with my “closed mind”. I don’t think I’m closed minded but I’ve always been a huge skeptic when it comes to big conspiracies or paranormal or anything in that realm. Speaking of paranormal occurrences, she’s personally had experience in that before we met. Said her house was haunted as a child and has seen apparitions at times. She’s 100% a believer in it. I would be too if I had an encounter. I haven’t. I’m skeptical but I don’t blow off the whole idea of anything paranormal existing. I want to have concrete evidence and sources. To be clear she and I aren’t conspiracy crazy, we just stumble upon the big ones and talk about it. Anyways, back to the title. Recently she started showing about something called PizzaGate? I’m not going to pretend to even understand most of it but from what I DO know is that it’s a pizzeria child trafficking ring. Somehow has Hilary Clinton wrapped up in all this as well as Ellen and Tom Hanks? I don’t know. I didn’t care to learn about it because I blew it off as ludicrous. Every now and then she’ll show me a video on TikTok or a tweet showing some info on it and I just say something like “that’s interesting” or “hmm”.  But about 2 hours ago, she showed me a TikTok about Justin Bieber and his yummy music video linked to the conspiracy. I just said “quit showing me this stupid conspiracy it’s silly!”. Apparently that was a no-no. She got heavily offended and went off saying how “you’re so closed minded on anything I show you. You’ve been sheltered all your life and won’t believe anything!” And spewed a few “facts” regarding the Pizzagate thing. So, did I do something wrong here?

2914,2020-06-22 05:55:06,hdlwfq,"NTA, my husband goes down conspiracy holes sometimes. . .I'll debate as if the conspiracy theory is *plausible* while both him and I knowing I think its bullshit. Once you let go of the truth, you might find some enjoyment in debating bullshit with more bullshit. It's like world building. 

Something like ""so say it is true. . .how would X have gotten to Y."" 
""So if it is true that the moon landing was faked, then how do we know the moon is also hollow?"" 

So long as you're still up front about how much bullshit you think it all is, you two might have some fun with that. (You may also accidentally see her prove herself wrong after you've been talking about it for a while)"

2921,2020-06-22 02:07:26,hdiuzb,"Social Network near sweep. Thank you! 

I wish Garfield won Best Supporting but oh well.

I realized that Easy A got nothing so that makes me slightly sad.

2011 will probably look like: Moneyball, The Artist, Midnight in Paris, The Tree of Life, **Drive**, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2, Hugo, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, The Help, Bridesmaids/A Separation/Rise of the Planet of the Apes

I think A Separation will miss due to many people not having seen it. I bet that last spot goes to Bridesmaids."
2922,2020-06-22 02:15:08,hdiuzb,"Glad to see the social network on top, easily one of the best movies I’ve ever seen"
2923,2020-06-22 01:42:16,hdiuzb,"Films with multiple wins:

The Social Network – 7

Inception – 4

Black Swan and Toy Story 3 – 3

Exit Through the Gift Shop and The Fighter – 2"
2924,2020-06-22 03:17:53,hdiuzb,"Oh wow, I guess I completely missed this entire year. Oh well, I would've just spent the whole time complaining about how overrated The Social Network is anyway. Toy Story 3 deserved *all* the awards.

Also, you guys really need to watch The Illusionist - the Academy was right to nominate it.

*And Super!!! You didn't nominate Super for anything??? Super is so good!!!!!*"
2925,2020-06-22 02:36:45,hdiuzb,"big shocker to see Eisenberg win best actor by so much. When I did my poll’s based on the actual winners Firth won by a handful, if I remember right. Eisenberg was my pick tho, so not mad about it"
2926,2020-06-22 18:46:23,hdiuzb,Am I just remembering completely wrong or was Social Network not neeearly as well received around release as it is today?
2927,2020-06-22 03:20:03,hdiuzb,"It's such a weak year though, I'm sure everyone who's seen A Separation is going to be nominating it. It's arguably better than all those movies you listed.

I also wouldn't count out The Descendants. Hopefully We Need To Talk About Kevin makes it in, since that is a *damn* good movie! (Lynne Ramsay needs a nomination...)"
2928,2020-06-22 02:13:23,hdiuzb,"Emma was the sixth spot for Best Actress, if Hailee had been in supporting then she would’ve made it in. It also was pretty close to getting in Best Soundtrack. 

I’m really curious how 2011 will shape up, should be interesting to see how it plays out and I could see it go in a lot of different directions."
2929,2020-06-22 05:20:54,hdiuzb,"The Descendants and Clooney's performance feel weirdly under-rated considering he's George Clooney. The script is tight, funny, dramatic, and the hospital scene is as good Clooney gets. 

Also fuck The Artist, that movie wasn't good."
2930,2020-06-22 02:21:48,hdiuzb,Inception is my favorite of the lineup but The Social Network is another one of my favorites of all time.
2931,2020-06-22 02:43:18,hdiuzb,"Yeah, I thought that category would be a lot closer then it ended it up being. Bridges was my pick but I’m definitely fine with Eisenberg winning."
2932,2020-06-22 04:23:13,hdiuzb,"I could also see 50/50 getting in, at least for actor and screenplay."
2933,2020-06-22 12:29:03,hdiuzb,Oh yeah I forgot about The Descendants. It’ll probably make it in. Maybe over Hugo? Or it could take that last spot.
2934,2020-06-22 05:31:21,hdiuzb,"> The script is tight, funny, dramatic

And let’s not forget that’s it’s also written by Dean Pelton"
2935,2020-06-22 10:14:51,hdiuzb,I was with you until you said fuck The Artist. Both great movies.
2936,2020-06-22 20:46:24,hdiuzb,That’s because it’s George Clooney playing George Clooney
2937,2020-06-22 09:12:30,hdiuzb,Didn't he win the Oscar for Best Adapted Deanplay for that
2938,2020-06-22 21:44:13,hdiuzb,Clooney playing Clooney is Danny Ocean.
2939,2020-06-30 16:13:12,hipqnj,"Absolutely love this one. 

I know Ron Howard is sometimes used as a punchline over in r/movies, but between this, Ransom (1996), Cinderella Man (2005) and Frost/Nixon (2008), he can be a genuinely terrific storyteller (just don't mention The Dilemma, haha)."
2940,2020-06-30 22:21:39,hipqnj,"This is my favorite movie. Has many awesome moments and tense situations, and is one of the few films I consider to portray actual heroism and bravery."
2941,2020-06-30 18:22:51,hipqnj,"Howard is a master in terms of the craftsmanship of film. Maybe I’m in the minority but I also love a beautiful mind and backdraft. And you can’t forget rush. When I think about those 7 films, ya he’s one hell of a storyteller."
2942,2020-07-01 01:26:33,hipqnj,Rush is my favorite Ron Howard movie because it just feels different from his other movies.
2943,2020-06-30 11:17:50,hijw0j,"I feel for you. It is really difficult dealing with a friend or family member who is mixed up with a cult and that is exactly what QAnon is.

No matter how much you reason with her or use logic to show that her beliefs are incorrect or things that some stranger on the internet told her isn't real-- keep in mind that she didn't use logic or reason to form those beliefs in the first place.

She is living in an alternate reality of QAnon and conspiracy theories. 

At this point I would suggest setting some boundaries, learning more about cults and how to talk to loved ones who are in them. Therapy is a good idea, for her definitely but probably for you as well if you are in contact a lot. It can be very draining. 

Best of luck to you both, you are not alone in this struggle."
2944,2020-06-30 10:43:26,hijw0j,The prison of belief can be hard to get out of. I imagine the only way it will stop is when in the future people will see what really happens. You can resign and accept that your mother has chosen a different path or do your best to open her eyes. Consulting a professional (like a psychologist who has experience in treating cult associates) is also an option
2945,2020-06-30 11:45:25,hijw0j,"Yes, we have all lost someone in the very same way. It did start with Ancient Aliens for my loved ones as well. I am so sorry for you losing your mom :( We can only hope that one day they snap out of it, but I can't see it happening. If you show concern or counter with facts, they only dig in harder."
2946,2020-06-30 13:06:03,hijw0j,"You're describing my conversations with my younger son here. He seems to be deeply mired in this ""alternate reality"" and completely closed to reason. Impossible to have a get-together without this stuff coming up. 

What I do is remind him that he knows I don't agree with him but am unwilling to discuss these issues, that I'd rather just focus on the beautiful little things life has to offer (it helps that I can refer to my age and simply say ""I'm too old for this ...""). 

When he does bite down on an unwelcome topic and cannot let go, I ignore him, or, when we're on the phone, I warn him that I'm about to hang up and that's what I do then (I usually give him three warnings). 

I've had some experience in other support groups so I'm not totally unprepared but learning more about cults is a wonderful idea (thanks to another poster!). 

Will this ever stop? I have no idea. So far it's only gotten worse for us. 

Sending virtual hugs and encouragement!"
2947,2020-06-30 10:35:26,hijw0j,I'm sorry. Sending virtual hugs
2948,2020-06-30 13:44:29,hijw0j,"These stories are all to familiar now.. Q has had all these people off for mugs. Q’s messages reach a particular audience who already have an affinity for conspiracies and a deep rooted distrust towards governments and people in positions of power. It doesn’t take much to persuade this type of person as they have always been looking for this narrative and it suddenly fits and everything seems to just click for them. The worst part is you can’t disprove any of there ideologies, not even with solid factual evidence because it will instantly be dismissed as fake new. Almost the perfect defence for conspiracy theorists, this way they can validate everything they say as true an you say as false."
2949,2020-06-30 15:30:06,hijw0j,"I feel for you, and I can only hope that the Q stuff is flash-in-the-pan for people like your mother. I have to say it's sad that Q has just homogenized all the slightly kooky people into all believing the same bullshit, and following the same grifters. It makes it harder to get through to them because there are just so many people on board with it."
2950,2020-06-30 20:35:08,hijw0j,"I’m sorry, I’ve lost my mom too. It hurts so much when they’re willing to belittle you and your education because “some guy on the Internet” is so much smarter. I’ve been getting more depressed as I realize I can’t even talk to my own mother anymore. I hope you have alternative support to help you through!"
2951,2020-07-02 10:32:03,hijw0j,"While I took its claims with a grain of salt, the cheerfulness and focus on a better future that was all over that The Secret movie helped get me sober. I can still quote my favorite parts. 

That being said, I don’t have any advice but do send encouragement. I’m glad you got this out. Hang in there. I hope things get better."
2952,2020-07-04 14:42:27,hijw0j,It sounds like her mom also has schizophrenia
2953,2020-06-30 18:24:46,hijw0j,"Thank you for listening and for your advice. It’s hard to accept that I’m not going to be able to get through to her, but reading all the stories here is helping remind me that I’m not alone in this."
2954,2020-06-30 15:30:23,hijw0j,"Okay so ancient aliens is one of my favorite shows, just because of how batshit crazy it is. None of it is real, but the thought experiment is fun and listening to the people arguing it makes for a good time (until you think tok hard about it and end up at the very blatant racism it perpetuates). My mom used to watch it with me, but a couple months ago, she forgot to take her meds on the same day that my q uncle told her about q. I thought she had always watched it with me in the same way that we watched the x files together - fun, but absolutely fiction. Well, on a day when her brain chemicals were a bit out of balance, she started to believe it all. I was able to talk her out of it once we realized that she hadn't taken her meds that day, since she knows how important her meds are. But man, that was a scary day. I've stopped watching ancient aliens and other conspiracy shows with her just in case anything sticks."

2956,2020-06-30 18:28:48,hijw0j,"That’s tough. It’s so hard to maintain a connection with a loved one knowing they’re always going to bring this stuff up. I like how you set your boundaries very clearly though, I’m going to have to practice this, and I’ll definitely read up a bit more on cults. Thank you!"
2957,2020-06-30 18:29:14,hijw0j,"Thank you, your hugs are well received. :)"
2958,2020-06-30 18:31:19,hijw0j,"That truly is the most frustrating part, anything she claims is the truth, but anything I bring to the table is fake news. It’s so aggravating!! You’re right though, it seems she’s been thinking this way for a long time and she’s finally found “like-minded people.” I know she found them through Facebook, I wonder if they were suggested to her through Facebook recommendations..."
2959,2020-06-30 20:57:46,hijw0j,"Ugh I know how you feel! Thankfully my dad is really understanding about the whole situation (they’re not together anymore), but my relationship with my mom has been drifting over the last few years and I feel like this put the final nail in the coffin. I hope you have support too! It’s nice finding a place like this where people understand just how painful it can be."
2960,2020-06-30 23:09:03,hijw0j,"Please don't lose hope of getting through to her. It may take longer than any of us would like or expect. This is more like a religion than just some out there beliefs or conspiracy theories. 

When we fact check and and try to get through to the people we care about, they are being encouraged online by internet propaganda telling them that they are right and our real and legitimate sources are ""fake"" and can't be trusted. Sometimes there are mental health issues or dementia mixed in with the alternate world they are seeking out and being told they are living in. It doesn't help that the President and a few Cable ""News"" stations often deal in fantasy."
2961,2020-06-30 18:26:36,hijw0j,Yeah I felt the same about the show! Just a bit of fun. I’m glad you were able to get a hold of your mom before her thinking became too out of control. Thanks for sharing. ❤️

2963,2020-07-01 03:36:26,hijw0j,I listen to a lot of Joe Rogan and I’ve never heard ANY QAnon BS from him.
2964,2020-07-03 12:04:54,hijw0j,Joe Rogan isn't anti Vax or into qanon. He's a very sane open-minded guy who will talk to guests of different viewpoints but calls out any bs he hears from them
2965,2020-06-30 21:53:58,hijw0j,"Joe rogan is anti vax? I'm not a fan of his bro style so I dont listen to his podcast, but I didnt know you could get to anti vax and qanon from him."
2966,2020-07-01 01:05:23,hijw0j,"I’ll definitely continue to fight the good fight when I can, but it has become so draining. When this first began I was really getting obsessed with proving her wrong but I think now I’ve adjusted my priorities and expectations a bit. If I want to save my sanity and any semblance of relationship I still have with her, I feel like I’m just going to have to pick my battles."

2974,2020-06-30 09:00:58,hijo6b,"SS: During the height of lockdown there was a lot of speculation and theory about Ellen, Oprah, Hanks etc and various celebs posting what seems to be code on social media, due to potentially being arrested for their involvement in the globalist paedo cult. That seems to have faded away from this sub since BLM and restrictions easing off.

It's hard to say whether these secrets arrests are real or not, but this article caught my attention, and when you connect it altogether the way this author has, I can't help but feel some valid points are made.

What do you think? Note, I'm not a Q or Trump supporter even if this author seems to be. It feels ridiculous having to explain this, but I see merit in some of his points **without** being a Q/Trump supporter.

What I'm mainly interested in is the fact that Hanks hasn't been posted on social media for over a month, the Ellen show is cancelled, she is undeniably wearing some form of anklet bracelet (not reviewed in the article, but you can find that info easily) and that there are definitely coded messages going on between celebrities on social media.

What's also interesting is if you go to this website: [californiaarrests.org](https://californiaarrests.org), and you type in the names of the celebrities that have supposedly been arrested in the article, they come up.

The owner of this website purports to be a private investigator who has access to information from various jails and police departments which regular citizens don't. It is not an official US Govt website, but this is who she says she is. If you want full access to the records you have to pay. If I wasn't so poor I would be curious to spend $5 to gain access to these records. Like I typed in Brad Pitt, Lisa Kudrow, Jennifer Aniston, Vin Diesel, etc, and results are shown."

2987,2020-06-30 10:40:43,hijo6b,"It’s mentioned in this article, quite a bit down the page. As well it seems possible as if the fb user (Rhen Carberry) that has published the arrest list, may have (purchased?) the full access to the records from the site listed in op."
2988,2020-06-30 10:10:46,hijo6b,"Link?

I also saw a post on this sub-reddit that decoded and broke down the symbology between the ""magic tricks"" that Ellen and some other magician were posting."
2989,2020-06-30 11:08:07,hijo6b,"People don't have much faith after four years but Q is true, but we're all so blackpilled we can't believe someone would actually still be fighting for us.

160,000 sealed indictments and Guantanamo Bay expansion is for the shadow war.

Something seriously fucky went on with Hanks Oprah and Ellen, Ellen should have been arrested for that shit she pulled after Las Vegas, and Oprah after the kids in Africa.

Every celebrity in Hollywood is probably under a RICO investigation."
2990,2020-06-30 14:58:17,hijo6b,"My guess is that since the cabal still controls the media, if this information were to be released well then there would be chaos. If Q is real, then obviously just dropping this information as is would spark absolute outrage. Think of the amount of people who despise Trump with every fibre in their body. Hell me and my girlfriend aren't even American but we've had some arguments, which were a result of her hatred towards Trump and me not being 100% on board with it (even if I'm not a conservative myself!).

So you can imagine a huge number of people would be suspicious and would accuse Trump of fabricating shit to push his own cause. Like there would be fucking anarchy if all of a sudden people found out that their favourite idols such as Tom Hanks, the cast of Friends, Will Ferrell, Barack Obama, Madonna etc etc had been EXECUTED by the US Government. It would be insane.

So while I'm hugely skpetical of Q, a part of me can understand the reasoning of not releasing this information **if it's true**. Things need to change somehow. I don't know what. But there needs to be serious groundwork laid for people to be able to accept this (again, if it is true). Cognitive dissonance is very real. At the moment people can't even comprehend how coronavirus might be a tool of people in power, can you imagine how they'd react if they were told their celebrity idols were paedophiles who had now been executed?

Again, it would be insane. I don't know if the people are ready or HOW they ever will be able and I don't even know if this is legit. Q and the arrests could be the most sinister, advanced psyop we've ever seen and Trump really could be the NWO King. I don't know. But a part of me is more inclined to believe he isn't and that well, the article I posted in my OP and all the crazy Q shit, it could have a leg to stand on. I don't know anymore."
2991,2020-06-30 14:28:39,hijo6b,"yOu PeOplE

If you'd bothered to do any research you'd realise soon that the terms hotdog, pizza, cheese, etc. are widely used as cryptic language for paedophilies to send coded messages to each other.

But let me guess. You haven't read a single Wikileaks email and you think politicians openly talking about how a sitting US president is ordering ""$65000 worth of hotdogs and pizza"" which was flown in the middle of the night from Chicago to the White house is OK and does not raise any skepticism."

Because it didn't happen.  The list even has George Soros on it.  This is the guy who is supposedly behind all the BLM and antifa.  How are they not talking about him being arrested and executed?

My point is they would be talking about this if true.  Dems would bring it up."
3008,2020-06-30 16:07:19,hijo6b,"Maybe it runs the risk of confirming everything and hastening their demise even further. Perhaps it's just a gamble they're not willing to take just yet. I don't know. I'm just an observer trying to make sense of it all.

>Also, why do  you argue over the president of another country?  That seems so foolish  to me to get worked up over another nation's politics.  I don't give a  shit about any other president of X country.

That's very nice for you. Unfortunately for the rest of us what happens in the United States has severe reprecussions for the rest of the world. I find it strange how you haven't seemed to grasp that. As a European, *everything* that happens over there has an influence on my life. I have every right to be interested and at this point with how fucked up the world is due to American politics I almost feel like we should start having a say as well. Sorry for caring."
3009,2020-06-30 16:10:47,hijo6b,really? name one thing Trump has done that influenced your life.  What law did Trump sign that affects you?  I'm genuinely curious.
3010,2020-06-30 16:11:21,hijo6b,The mere fact that Trump was elected has changed my relationship with several people.
3011,2020-07-12 19:44:25,hijo6b,I ask this same question to everyone... What did trump do in his term that negatively affected your life?
3012,2020-06-30 16:34:54,hijo6b,"Damn dude, sorry that happened."
3013,2020-06-30 16:41:35,hijo6b,"Your sarcasm is noted. I gave you the most basic example, that being I've always felt the demonization of Trump had something more going on beyond the scenes rather than just ""this guy is bad everyone should hate him!"". To be honest it was a rather facetious answer as I don't really care enough to explain.

Really, you're making the point that American politics shouldn't matter to me. I'll give you another quick example that contradicts that. I was living in France when the 2015 Paris attacks happened. That is a direct result of American politics fucking around in the Middle East, mainly the destruction of Iraq and the chaos and insurgent fundamentalist groups that arose afterwards (or were perhaps created by the cabal themselves). That affected my life right to the core. And that's just one example. The changes to immigration and the even more increasing attacks in France, Belgium, Germany, UK, etc continued to alter the way I lived my life.

If you care to know other examples to prove your little point you can just Google ""world news"" and connect the dots yourself."

3035,2020-06-30 02:50:45,hidrx5,Good Voice acting doesn’t always carry over to good screen acting is my only point. If we’re picking actors purely based off of likeness then obviously yeah cast the real voice actors but if they were to actually make a movie and make it good I’d want big name actors playing the roles. That’s just my opinion
3036,2020-06-30 02:52:44,hidrx5,Honestly. And this is just my opinion. I'd much rather see the flesh and bones of those characters in that movie. I would be comparing other people to those original cast choices.
3037,2020-06-30 02:55:20,hidrx5,That’s fair. I’m just a big movie guy so I guess is naturally have an open mind to other actors playing the roles. This is all just hypothetical anyway. It’s not like 15 A list actors would ever sign on to do a video game adaptation movie anyway lol

what vote at local levels and change the system from within locally to hopefullly get good officials elected that actually represents them/us?

stay armed and try to take over the govt with weapons? no ones trained in arms and combat, even if there are vets/ ex mil/ how much could they possibly do.

there’s no thought out plan. just people saying “oh gosh look at this! it’s atrocious!” and then continue to move on the next day.

we saw it with the FCC law when we found out our internet rights were getting taken away, we gave a shit then didn’t.

https://qmap.pub/proofs

I personally think it's coming from the NSA and it's a ridiculously powerful psyop internet type weapon to steer the narrative of the internet conspiracy community.  I think the ultimate goal here is sort of a soft disclosure where the government will confirm some conspiracies while keeping some of the bigger hoaxes going.  To say that it is a 4chan larp of some guy sitting in his basement is pretty unrealistic at this point.  I occasionally stop in and read the comments on some of the more popular Q channels on YouTube and read the comments to kind of get the pulse of the community.  When you put up your noose video I went and watched the link and it was filled with comments from thousands of Q believers so you can see it is a very effective social media weapon"

You guys like to auto-hoax, I like to leave everything as a consideration...

Q is just some source of info.  It plays on the usual conspiracy workings of - do your own research.  Usual Q posts seem to just point in general directions for the reader to look into.  They call those ""bread crumbs"".  People who look into bread crumbs call themselves ""bakers"" who go and look for, what I would consider correlation....not causation, just coincidences.  From there many make assumptions that probably shouldn't have been.

As far as I can tell, the conspiracy ""piggy backs"" off of most of the main conspiracies that people consider.  Starting with the CIA before JFK, the MK Ultra, the President being a pawn from that point forward, whether it be a Blue or a Red one, all the same ""Deep State"" team who is no longer representing Americans.  The least convincing of the works is that Trump is the ""good guy"".  The most convincing works is that our elected officials are not actual representatives of us. 

All the Q people site the qmap.pub.  There are pages on there for you to read up on Q's claims for how this all started.  That is where I would go, forget the proofs, just read up on the ""global themes"" to understand what Q is about.  https://qmap.pub/themes?pg=4"

3086,2020-06-29 12:12:48,hhy4in,"Q is the equivalent of flat-eathers, except it has a strong right wing following that thinks trump is on the side of the people. 

It has been shown time and time again that q was created on 4chan, but well, these people refuse to accept that the God- emperor that they have chosen is just as corrupt as all other presidents. 

Q has what he call drops on 8kun, I think, that are basicly obscure ramblings that people assign any meaning to them that they want. 

Again, I personally look at them like the flat-earthers of the conspiracy world."
3087,2020-06-29 12:30:57,hhy4in,"It's Trumps re-election campaign, a conspiracy myth that mixes the truth of a global pedofile ring (proven by Epstein) with a lot of fantasy and
wish fulfillment. They believe Trump is going to end political corruption, put every liberal celeb in jail and usher in a new age of prosperity and wealth for America (or even the world)"
3088,2020-06-29 19:36:58,hhy4in,"I spent a few months digging into Q when it first surfaced. Though it gives hope to the pro-American who wants to some real change, like Trump taking down the cabal, Hillary getting arrested etc, it actually uses it against you. After a few months of this LARP saying the same garbage like they will be arrested many times, I realize nothing EVER happens. It’s full of shite, and Q followers will always grasp for straws for any kind of evidence. It’s like if they see the number 17 on a Big Mac they will say it’s Trump using McDonald’s as an ally to take down GMOs. Stupid shit like that. It’s comical though nonetheless :)."
3089,2020-07-01 07:24:05,hhy4in,I've seen some of your vids. It shocks me you're largely unaware of Q. I have been into Q from day one. It's legit.

3092,2020-06-29 11:47:28,hhy4in,"In fairness, I am the dude who created this sub.

The idea was not to ban all discussion which may be interpreted as political; the idea was to create a sub where there would be a greater focus on non-political conspiracy theories than is presently the case on r/conspiracy.

I know so little about Q that I do not even consider it fundamentally political, I thought Q was mostly based around accusations of celebrities being ped0s."
3093,2020-06-30 03:21:51,hhy4in,"Theories that go in the face of all evidence. 

A) f.e science

B) q, all of the failed predictions. 

Fringe group, not part of 'mainstream' conspiracies.

A) applies to both equally. 

I could probably make more comparisons, but ah, I am lazy."
3094,2020-06-29 12:20:50,hhy4in,"Q is a PsyOp which capitalizes on the truth of the power structures in the West being run by criminals and degenerates and twists it into pro-Trump propaganda, with a large sprinkling of all kinds of far-out there (David Ike Style) conspiracies such as lizard people and hollow earth.

Its clearly an operation that follows PsyOps standard operating procedures (kernel of truth which you know, twisted to manipulate you). The basic premise (the government is controlled by a corrupt elite) is true, while the rest is mostly disinfo created to derail civilian investigations and get support for Trump from fringe groups like flat-earthers and far-right conspiracies (jews control the world)."

It will be your thing once you actually get into the data, observations and mathematics that are proving the earth is flat.  You will be coming up with all kinds of excuses to explain observations that should be impossible on a globe.  Here's a short flat earth observation if you're interested

3104,2020-06-29 16:46:29,hhy4in,"I think denial can be part of it but it is also false conclusions from assumptions and/or misunderstanding.

Edit: perfect example. Claiming the video above is proof of flat earth when the only thing it proves is the lake is flat under those conditions. A false conclusion from an assumption that these conditions are representative of what will be observed everywhere."

Ryan Holiday is excellent. If you haven't read his sort of Stoicism trilogy, it's very good. He was the person who got me hooked on this. Well him and Tim Ferriss to a smaller degree. Stoicism has been a major help to me in being able to accept and love myself for who I am instead of constantly worrying about the things I did in the past. Sounds like it's done some of the same for you getting through that first week.

I am glad you are with us! R3ap3r mentioned the DCI, I think that's one of the most worthwhile things to do every day is to check in there and read people's responses. We're always here for support however we can be.

Congratulations on making it through that first week! That is awesome! Keep it up and hope to see you around DCI."

Although if 1 is in her tritype like you say than maybe that could explain it. Cheers"

3191,2020-06-28 23:13:27,hhj0td,"""Through denying their feelings of fear to one extent or another, Sexual Sixes go against danger from a position of strength; therefore, they have a passion for searching for or securing a position of strength. And it's not just a strong character they seek, but the kind of strength that makes somebody else afraid-they want to assume a powerful enough to hold the enemy at a distance. These Sixes display a forcefulness that comes from no wanting to be weak, and they don't allow for weakness in themselves....""

"".....Sexual Sixes have a need not just for strength but for intimidation. As Naranjo suggests, this expression of intimidation is very much the essence of the character; if they appear strong, they won't be attacked. ....""

"".....Sexual Sixes give off the impression that they could get violent with anybody at any time, but that doesn’t mean that they have no fear. It is precisely out of a sense of fear that their anticipation of an attack comes-there is a somewhat paranoid imagining of danger, a belief that anyone can turn into a threat. However, these Sixes usually do not look afraid; their visible character could hardly be called ""fearful"" from the outside.

In contrast to the Self-Preservation Six, who backs away from threats, the couterphobic Sexual Six tends to move toward risky situations, feeling a sense of safety in actually confronting danger rather than hiding from it or avoiding it. They convince themselves (and others) that they are not victims of fear; they are convinced that fear is an emotion that should be eliminated systemically.....""

"".....The fact that these Sixes regularly move against danger (or perceived danger) can, at times, give them the appearance of a rebel, a daredevil, a risk taker, an adrenaline junkie, or a troublemaker. In some cases, Sexual Sixes may be prone to megalomania or having a ""hero complex."" In their own way, they seek to be ""good guys"" to avoid being punished. They may have the illusion that they are spontaneous, but they tend not to be.

Sexual Sixes tend to be very contrarian: they always have an argument at hand to refute and contradict an opinion. Instead of thinking in terms of ""best-case"" or ""worst-case"" scenarios, they think in terms of contrarian scenarios-if the trend is for others to focus on the worst, they will focus on the best; but if everyone is focusing on the best, they will assert the worst.....""

She also used the time turner to take more classes, which to me screams 3. She also breaks the rules a lot. i know it’s for the greater good a lot, but she breaks so many rules that a 1 would have a heart attack. That’s why I think she’s a 3 and not a 1. My sister is a sp 3w4, and we thought for a while she was a 1, and she is almost identical to hermione. That’s my two cents. Have a good day!"

Will Hunting is a counterphobic 6, you can see the difference between the two. Everything Will does is fear based, even when he gets unruly and abrasive. He fears getting hurt (his trauma definitely plays into that, and there's nothing to suggest that enneagram type isn't born from trauma)."

She's also always been into MLMs and almost lost $30k to a Ponzi scheme a decade ago, so no matter how ""smart"" she is, she's the type of person who is always duped by this stuff because she doesn't see it as getting scammed. She BELIEVES she can make money with MLMs. She BELIEVES their products are far better in quality than anything you can buy at a store. She BELIEVES Q is real and working with Trump to take down the pedophile ring.

She really is the kindest, sweetest woman, but this is truly what she believes now. It's at the point where I think the only thing that could change her mind is if I was the person Trump shot on 5th avenue. I'm sorry about your MIL, but like many others have said, there isn't too high of a rate of people ""snapping out of it."" People have to think logically to snap out of these things, and in my experience most people who believe Q aren't operating on that wavelength."

3223,2020-06-28 18:08:08,hhfut9,My MIL is all the way in and has been her whole life for various conspiracies. Until the world calms down a bit and politics stabilize I foresee no break in her beliefs. It’s really sad and frustrating and it’s caused a lot of family fights. She’s “disowned” me and blocked me because I refused to comment or watch the many videos she’d send me on a daily basis.
3224,2020-06-28 22:13:33,hhfut9,"They don’t walk away.  Some might shift their beliefs (as in maybe not believing JFK Jr is alive ) but still believe all the pedophile crap.  There is enough garbage in the QAnon cult to satisfy just about every susceptible person.     

And sadly, it even validates their willingness to lie to cover up their following. My EX is so terrified of the world (business and his family and friends) finding out he follows QAnon, that he only talks about it on Twitter (and now Parler).... and he has no friends and family in either platform. He then tells ME he doesn’t follow Q anymore and he got everything out of it that he could.  Of course then I see him posting Q things on his Twitter account, i mention it to him and he blows it off.  

So even IF someone should actually walk away from QAnon, the chances of them being honest about it are slim to none."

3269,2020-06-28 04:57:43,hh7fd8,"From what I’m reading, he is being accused of being a pedophile from a couple of people. I guess the one guy died after listing several names, including Tom Hanks. I have also seen some people claim Hanks is dead or in prison. I don’t think anyone has seen him publicly for a while, so that’s probably adding more fuel to the fire. Again, I don’t know where the rumors started, so I don’t know how much truth there is to it. 

I need to do some more digging, but it seems like quite a few people from Hollywood are being accused of this stuff and they are rumored to be under house arrest. Jimmy Kimmel is one I’ve seen pop up and I find it very odd that just now he’s getting heat for the blackface segments he did. Very odd time to finally talk about it and odd time to take a break from his show. It makes me think there could be some truth to the rumors. 

But as far as Hanks goes, I wouldn’t be surprised if he was involved with the other pedos. Hollywood and Washington DC are filled with some horrible people. You don’t usually get to be one of the top people in those industries without doing something bad. Maybe it’s all bullshit, but never underestimate how cruel people in positions of power can be."

He sounds exactly like a teacher in my school who would speak to the students in lower-level maths classes like they were preschoolers even though half of them were already adults. Nobody likes being condescended to. No shit we don’t have a personal relationship with Tom Hanks just because we’ve seen Castaway! Who the hell is claiming otherwise? This isn’t news to anyone except you, apparently. The way he states these screamingly obvious facts like they’re epiphanies really speaks volumes about the kind of person he is. It’s like when he tweeted some quote that was something along the lines of “having a Master’s in Divinity doesn’t make you a master of divinity” or something and his mind was blown. Like it was the first time he’d ever realised that maybe, just MAYBE, he doesn’t know everything. I am not exaggerating when I say that I think Jeremy is dangerous and I fear for Jinger, Felicity and the new baby’s safety. People with that much of an ego are the quickest to fly into a rage."

I recall the time she wanted to put a lid on some coffee before he started the car and he was like nO bAbE iT’LL bE FiNe and of course it fucking spilled everywhere. Everyone says Jinger’s so dumb but I think Jerm is just as freaking stupid but had access to a real education. That’s the only intellectual difference between them, and I’m gonna say Jinger actually has a leg up because she knew that shit would spill.

3385,2020-08-20 04:12:55,icx0ws,All this off a measly 200mg?
3386,2020-08-20 05:46:16,icx0ws,This sounds like the 4th installation of The Hangover series
3387,2020-08-20 15:45:11,icx0ws,"I recently did something similar, only it was 100 mg and a rice krispie treat (I had eaten the whole thing thinking it was 50 mg). I was home though and made it to the toilet. Thankfully my husband is a stoner and knows how to deal with idiots (like myself lol)"
3388,2020-08-21 07:49:11,icx0ws,200 MG? You gotta pump those numbers up those Are rookie numbers!
3389,2020-08-21 13:04:51,icx0ws,"As a stoner , I instantly laughed when I read the title, but damn, after reading the whole story I hope you felt better asap after that :D"
3390,2020-08-20 08:10:40,icx0ws,"I did that thing where after an hour you say “why hasn’t it kicked in yet?  There must be something wrong with it, I better take some more!”

I took 45 mg that night, it was the worst night of my life.  200?  Fuuuuuuuck...."
3391,2020-08-19 21:53:03,icx0ws,It took 2 years for me to find a Chicken Bake remotely appetizing again. The night was too traumatic and left my stomach and throat in so much pain.
3392,2020-08-20 02:38:51,icx0ws,"Here in Ontario they have to take us to the nearest hospital, unless that hospital cannot provide the specific care needed. You aren’t allowed to request which hospital you want to go to"
3393,2020-08-20 04:25:11,icx0ws,"Medical director usually only one that can call going somewhere besides closest, and usually only because of nature of call, trauma, etc. Laws changed due to Ben Wilson in the mid 80s who died from a gunshot wound when taken to an ER without a trauma surgeon and lost blood over hours of waiting and died. Top hs basketball prospect in the usa."
3394,2020-08-20 12:33:13,icx0ws,"Damn I can’t even imagine. You won’t die but weed overdoses are no joke (as much as it sounds like one).

I had 4 droplets from a tincture once and was stoned all day into the next day when I had to wake up and go to school. By the second day of being high it doesn’t even feel good."
3395,2020-08-20 14:50:46,icx0ws,"I totally agree, my country is pretty fucked up. And I served in the military to protect our fucked up ways of life."

3397,2020-08-20 02:26:01,icx0ws,Good bot
3398,2020-08-19 22:56:54,icx0ws,I wrote it in that tone...
3399,2020-08-20 04:13:54,icx0ws,"I did, and I’ve only seen it once. I gotta go rewatch it."
3400,2020-08-20 07:00:05,icx0ws,"God damn it...yes, yes I did"
3401,2020-08-19 22:21:15,icx0ws,"Actually, just yesterday I kinda had another episode. I was testing an edible for work but like legit took a tiny ass bite. But I hadn’t eaten anything so my stomach was empty. Was puking for 2 hours. It reminded me of my previous experience so I decided to share today. I guess I didn’t learn my lesson. I didn’t end up in the ER this time."
3402,2020-08-20 00:45:40,icx0ws,LMAO haha
3403,2020-08-20 01:11:45,icx0ws,"Yeah, I was confused too, but then again, I was high at the time. Maybe I misunderstood them."
3404,2020-08-19 22:32:10,icx0ws,"Yeah. Glad it wasn’t more serious than that, but I was scared for my life."
3405,2020-08-19 23:39:21,icx0ws,"Tag, you’re it!"
3406,2020-08-20 03:18:27,icx0ws,"Can't even get edibles in most states more than 10mg because of all of these idiots consuming 200mg and then going to the hospital.  Fucking ridiculous honestly.  Let's make all of the people dependent on edible cannabis consume substantially more calories or go back to smoking and ruining your lungs so the idiots who decide to moonlight one night without reading the label dont freak out too much.

I guess we should change all liquor ABV to beer percentages to prevent that too no?"
3407,2020-08-20 02:33:45,icx0ws,It just hits each person differently.
3408,2020-08-20 03:30:02,icx0ws,Ya thats just not true. I ate a 900 mg bar before getting a massage then had another 400 mg of cookies later on. At no point did I turn into a puking gibbering idiot. Some people really can't handle their drugs and/or have underlying mental issues that cause them to react that ridiculously.
3409,2020-08-20 07:43:24,icx0ws,Awww why?
3410,2020-08-20 07:15:55,icx0ws,"Dude, fuck that shit and all its clones. That shit is the only thing I have had that has made me come even remotely close to a full on psychotic episode."
3411,2020-08-20 07:43:05,icx0ws,"100%. Even though I’m still paying off school. I don’t think the education was worth it, but the experiences were."
3412,2020-08-20 07:44:05,icx0ws,That’s for another TIFU. And there are plenty.
3413,2020-08-20 16:46:23,icx0ws,"Hey man, thanks for sharing. My heart goes out to you. 

I unfortunately have a lot of stories of me visiting the ER. I try my best to take care of myself, but because I’m a diabetic, I’m extremely prone to infections, especially skin infections. So I feel your pain."
3414,2020-08-20 07:40:03,icx0ws,"Yeah,  people like me, but what about people who don’t feel anything with the same if not a greater dose?"
3415,2020-08-20 08:51:23,icx0ws,"I know, right? Like, I've never seen THC do anything like this to anyone except in a movie. It reads like how Hollywood execs think it works, no one screams nonsense like that because they're a little baked."
3416,2020-08-19 21:54:31,icx0ws,i puked chicken alfredo one time and swore off dairy for a long while afterwards so i feel your pain

3418,2020-08-20 21:26:42,icx0ws,"Agreed!  It was not fun, and even 20 years later I still feel it."
3419,2020-08-20 12:15:37,icx0ws,What intrigues me the most here is the phrase ‘testing an edible for work’.......  y’all hiring?
3420,2020-08-19 22:26:00,icx0ws,"Damn bro, I only ever experienced something from smoking but far less severe and last time years ago, on the other hand I have almost no experience with edibles."
3421,2020-08-20 03:50:32,icx0ws,You have the right to refuse care under most circumstances
3422,2020-08-19 22:34:50,icx0ws,Yeah that is the feeling.
3423,2020-08-20 07:03:24,icx0ws,Shut your filthy mouth and leave the ABV alone lol.
3424,2020-08-20 07:12:29,icx0ws,"Or his body processes it differently. I have a guy that works for me that absolutely cannot have noproxen; it makes him near catatonic. A normal, over the counter NSAID hits him like a truck. Now me, I can take 1.5 times the suggested dose and it just takes the edge off the pain in my knees."

3427,2020-08-20 07:34:51,icx0ws,Oh agreed. We didn’t know how dangerous it was. I could have actually died that night. Who knows if it’s had any lasting effect on my mind! That was 10 years ago now.
3428,2020-08-20 16:53:46,icx0ws,"Oh man, I've only had 3 visits and all were necessary but not really from underlying medical causes like diabetes. 

Though I am borderline close to developing it with how heavy I am, luckily I just started cutting back on a ton of sugar. (Not carbs per say but just pure sugar/corn syrups) 

&#x200B;

I appreciate the whole ""heart goes out to you"" thing but honestly I'm totally okay. It's just a  funny story cause neither the edible nor hospital are related to each other haha, and funny cause I'm still alive."
3429,2020-08-20 15:42:38,icx0ws,I'm not sure I understand the question.  What about those people?  Those are the ones who are annoyed at these stupid restrictions.
3430,2020-08-19 21:55:48,icx0ws,"It sucks especially when you really like the food. I had always been a fan of the Chicken Bake, until it betrayed me..."

3433,2020-08-20 15:46:44,icx0ws,free healthcare is not as nice as it sounds

3435,2020-08-19 22:36:13,icx0ws,It happens
3436,2020-08-20 19:12:00,icx0ws,"Reddit wasn’t around 25 years ago... so it would make sense that people would post stuff from the past.

Thanks for reading my garbage though. :)"
3437,2020-08-20 15:54:45,icx0ws,"Restrictions assume everyone’s tolerance is are standard.

Enforcing the restrictions would be like being limited to buying a 6 pack of beer."

3440,2020-08-30 18:58:49,icx0ws,Oh noes. So when you overdose on thc... Is like.. E. Horrible.
3441,2020-08-19 23:17:44,icx0ws,"Candy edibles like gummies and lozenges normally come in 5 or 10 mg. I know some medical doses are higher, I took a 50 mg chocolate once and was couch locked for hours. I have never heard of a 200 mg candy before, I cant imagine its legal to even manufacture a single candy with that dosage.

I dont think the vomiting was your body trying to purge the thc, but rather you having severe vertigo due to the thc, which combined with an overly full stomach caused the vomiting. I have another friend who is a regular smoker who has gotten vertigo a couple times from edibles."
3442,2020-08-19 23:18:14,icx0ws,"It's gotta be cookies or brownies, something where you're expected to eat the whole thing. Then have half a bite and you'll be alright."
3443,2020-08-19 22:59:09,icx0ws,Ya
3444,2020-08-20 16:25:38,icx0ws,"This is exactly what they are doing.  Many states that have legalized cannabis do not let sellers produce edibles which come in concentrations higher than 10mg anymore.  Specifically because of people that don't read or pay attention and take more than they should and freak out like you describe in your post.

Can you imagine if you needed to take lets say 1000mg per day of some medicine you normally take, and the government then implemented a restriction to only allow the manufacturer to sell those pills in 10mg form; so you have to consume 100 pills every day to achieve the proper dosage?  

This is basically what has happened.  Except it's worse in this case because it's not just pill filler you have to consume additionally with cannabis edibles - its highly caloric saturated fat which is used to carry the cannabinoids.

All of this pushes the users of cannabis to either unhealthy eating habits or back towards less safe methods of ingestion in the form of vaping/smoking."
3445,2020-08-20 16:52:38,icx0ws,"I got really bad hospitalization level food poisoning from some deviled eggs as a kid. 17 years later and I still haven't touched them, and even get sick when I smell them. I used to love deviled eggs and would eat loads of them at potlucks, which is why the food poisoning was as bad as it was."
3446,2020-08-20 17:24:15,icx0ws,"So that’s what it is.

In middle school, I was so stressed out from one of my assignments in a music and art appreciation course I took, and it caused me to have the worst headache I’ve ever had in my life. I could barely keep my head up, my eyes felt like they were going to sink into my head, the sides of my head were pounding... it was terrible. Even worse, I have anxiety, so I was pacing, kept trying to pet my cat for comfort, and thought I was dying. I eventually had to lay down for an hour, in agony, and it thankfully mostly went away. I took a shower afterwards, and finished the assignment. It was like a massive weight had been lifted off of my shoulders. It’s not even like I procrastinated on it or anything, just having my work graded by that teacher really stressed me out (I ended up with an A in the course anyway). Thinking about it today makes me feel a bit nauseous, honestly.

Right before the headache, I had eaten some of Bush’s sweet baked beans in a can (along with toast or something, I don’t remember anything except the beans). I can no longer eat those beans today. Whenever I think of the flavor, I feel a bit nauseous, and the back of my head always feels a bit odd. The best way I can describe the sensation is like the after taste of food, but with a headache, and it’s very mild, but it still sucks.

I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to eat those kinds of beans again."
3447,2020-08-19 23:20:41,icx0ws,Agreed. I still don’t feel good even on 5 and 10 mg. Should just not mess with edibles altogether.
3448,2020-08-20 02:12:16,icx0ws,"I used to get 100mg packs that had 4-5 gummies in them, meaning they were all about 20-25mg. Id usually eat half of those and do great"
3449,2020-08-20 03:47:07,icx0ws,"You’d be surprised - before the regulations kicked in here in CA, I was seeing some super potent stuff for sale."
3450,2020-08-20 15:48:18,icx0ws,"> dical doses are higher, I took a 50 mg chocolate once and was couch locked for hours. I have never heard of a 200 mg candy before, I cant imagine its legal to even manufacture a single candy with that dosage.

3451,2020-08-19 23:21:38,icx0ws,"Can’t say that I’m gonna give it a try. I enjoy smoking weed just fine. But edibles do make me feel like a bitch, no lie."

3453,2020-08-20 16:26:34,icx0ws,And this is why the legal market is broken. And so the black market thrives.
3454,2020-08-20 17:26:54,icx0ws,"That sounds more like a migraine than a headache to me, especially because the nap and shower helped it go away. Stress is a major factor in my migraines"
3455,2020-08-19 23:23:48,icx0ws,Edibles are pretty much for people who smoke like Snoop.
3456,2020-08-20 02:10:20,icx0ws,"I have the exact opposite issue. I must be very sensitive to weed because whenever I smoke I end up getting way too high every so often even using the same oil pen for weeks, whereas I can control exactly how much I'm ingesting when its an edible"
3457,2020-08-20 16:41:17,icx0ws,Thriving cannabis edible black market?  Where?
3458,2020-08-20 17:28:56,icx0ws,"Yeah, that would make more sense if it was a migraine."
3459,2020-08-19 23:28:05,icx0ws,"I believe it. But then again, my friends legit eat 1200mg edibles and it don’t do shit for them. I think my endocannabinoid system processes THC differently when I ingest it."
3460,2020-08-20 02:28:59,icx0ws,"Interesting. I definitely see how an edible can be a more accurate way of measuring out doses, but for me, I think I just don’t process it properly"
3461,2020-08-20 16:42:17,icx0ws,"Lol. I meant the black market cannabis industry thrives because of overregulation.
This includes edibles too."
3462,2020-08-20 00:11:24,icx0ws,It's all tolerance really. I used to eat 1000 mg twinkies and korova bars all the time and nowadays 10 mg is strong and 20 fucks me up.
3463,2020-08-20 02:47:34,icx0ws,"Its possible, have you used sublingual thc oil? I wonder if you'd have a similar issue with that"
3464,2020-08-20 03:46:35,icx0ws,I prefer to eat it because it gets me high. Smoking puts me to sleep.
3465,2020-08-20 07:38:41,icx0ws,I’m not familiar with the distinction. Sublingual thc oil?

3467,2020-08-20 16:18:11,icx0ws,Ahhhhh. I actually haven’t taken THC that way. I take CBD tinctures all the time though.

This may be evidence of the psychological and cognitive decline that people claim the media is trying to hide from citizens.

But that fact that suddenly he is involved with politics even with the current allegations (tabloid drama or not) of being a sexual predator and/or pedophile is bizarre. Why would you associate yourself with someone dealing with that when Epstein is still fresh in the public’s minds and you are trying to look like the favorable candidate.

Either another blunder from the Biden campaign or a slap in the face to the accusers of both Biden and Hanks."

3509,2020-08-19 16:20:36,icq32b,Greece has an extradition treaty with USA. No American criminals can hide there. I'm of the opinion Hanks was selected because if they can pin pedo on him the whole Hollywood thing tumbles down. Basically he's accused simply due to his wholesomeness and star power.

I've noticed it's very common to accuse everyone we don't like of sex crimes based on random pieces of social media and as these wild accusations grow you'll see more people self censorsing posts. This doesn't make them guilty or innocent it just speaks to the 2020 pedo accusation fever.

I just looked him up.. and he is indeed, Barack's half-brother. He has duel US/Kenyan citizenship, and serves as a consultant in DC. From what I gather, the two brothers have been feuding for some time, and Malik declared for Trump in 2016, and has supported him since. I may be wrong in my assessment, but based on the bits I read.. my very real sense is that Malik suffers from a massive case of jealousy, which motivates him against anything associated with Barack."

3698,2020-09-07 15:20:19,io882c,"I figure it is just one faction of the deep state versus the other. It’s always the traditionalists vs the globalists. Playing enemies in public but, are buds at the Baphomet orgies. I think Q is just one faction trying to play the other for power. Airing out the others dirty laundry. It’s all one big swamp with alligators wrestling to see who gets to run the show. 

Both sides are pedos. It’s just this time the globalist trafficking network is being exposed. And here we are in the middle trying to decide who are the good guys. None of them are. Trump and Q are the traditionalist faction and the dems are part of the globalist faction. Controlled opposition at every step. 

The Rich don’t think like us. They don’t behave like us. They don’t like us. They are pitting us against each other while they count their profits. 

We are the sheep in the pen focused on not getting eaten by the dog when we are being raised to be led to slaughter by the farmer who feeds us. 

Break the godspell and wake up. Both sides are playing us. One may be the lesser evil and it probably fluctuates with time but, don’t let that fool you into thinking they are good or doing anything for our benefit."
3699,2020-09-07 14:42:33,io882c,"I believe there are elements of truth to the Q movement. There are also parts of it I do not buy & find a little troubling. It involves many conspiracies that people already believe & incorporates them into the belief. It also brings in the issue of pedophilia among the elites, which is coming out more & more. The troubling part is how Trump is painted as a tool of God to break up this system. It also only involves people that have criticized Trump. His enemies are labeled as pedophiles or pedophile enablers. Then there is the thinking that Trumps behavior is to be dismissed as part of the plan & him playing a role to expose these rings. This allows him to do just about anything & it be excused by the followers. Some followers fall into a cult like mindset where they blindly believe anything Q says & do not think for themselves in regards to Trumps actions. If you are able to support Q & still maintain independent thought it’s fairly harmless, but some do not seem to do that, which makes it possibly dangerous down the road"

Is it because this subreddit really is so anti QAnon? Or is it something else? ""When do you expend ammunition? All for some LARPer in a basement?"". QAnon is real. Now I conservatively say they're 90% legit info and 10% disinfo, after all they themselves even say ""Disinformation is necessary"". 

Anyway, don't let the paid vocal minority in your comments make you think that everyone here is anti QAnon. They are just serving the agenda, posting pro establishment narratives while trying to seem like a normal dude, bro. QAnon is real, and I consider this to be proof that it is actually being run by Trump and Company.

Losing a family member to Q anon is not something I ever saw coming it knocked me off my feet, I truly felt like I was grieving when it happened to me. Thankfully I also have supportive friends but I almost couldn’t bear the reality that my parents support a man like Donald Trump. It’s been a few months since it happened, and I see my family differently but things have gotten easier. This thread has been a huge beacon of hope for me, for a while there I felt that nobody was sane, and even began to question my own sanity. I even watched their ridiculous videos out of desperation to understand, that maybe finding truth in their theories would bring me peace. Thank god I saw right through it and shortly after found this thread, I know now with full confidence I am not the irrational one. I’m sorry you are going through this, I hope that our loved ones do come out of this eventually, but if they don’t we will be okay and family is not always strictly blood. It sounds like you are a kind and empathetic person, and your parents do not deserve to have you around while they are blinded by hate."

I have four siblings and while they're all still living in reality, they don't live nearby so it usually feels like it's just me vs the parents. Luckily I've got really incredible friends who would do probably anything for me. And I actually did read your post right after making mine, and I related to a lot of what you said.  It's terrifying to feel like you and your family are characters in an episode of the Twilight Zone. My therapist is more optimistic and believes that if Trump isn't reelected that a lot of people will come back to reality, but I'm less sure. Regardless, I'm glad that you're alright and beautifully sane. Stay strong."

3792,2020-09-05 17:04:46,in14ga,"Yes, Epstein ran a child sex trafficking ring. Yes, some wealthy and powerful people participated in his ring. Guess we’ll find out who as the court cases move onwards.

However, these Q people started out with a theory that a DC pizza place was a headquarters of their sex ring. With code words on their menu like “cheese” and “mushrooms”. One of them stormed it with a gun looking for the hidden children. Found nothing, obviously. 

Tom Hanks has nothing to do with anything. They hate him because he’s popular, successful, and basically seems like a nice man. Three things they aren’t. 

Hillary Clinton has been the target of political conspiracies for decades. I’ve never thought the woman had any political principles or scruples, but her political opponents used to spread conspiracies that she and Bill were responsible for over 20 murders. Don’t hear much about that anymore.

Bill Clinton did associate with Epstein, as did Donald Trump. Obviously, not everyone who was ever seen with Epstein ever was a pedo, although it is grounds for suspicion. 

Bill Clinton released a statement detailing the specific times he claims he interacted with Epstein - believe it or don’t. 

Donald Trump is on record saying: “I've known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy. He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life."".

Epstien was definitely a pedo. That we know that from actual verifiable news. We also know Trump visited his island, that Epstien used Mar a Lago and Trump's modeling agency to find underage women for his island, and that Trump has complimented Epstien's choice of young women and that Trump has 20 sexual assault cases against him, including for raping a 13 year old girl.

There were even times Schaub gave him shit because he couldn't be in studio for a podcast because of it. Truth is they would all kill for Callens position at the time. It's ironic that someone like Joe talks down to every single comic who goes on his podcast that also has a tv role considering thats what got him the fame he has today.

3834,2020-09-04 14:35:54,imbndc,Such a great band.
3835,2020-09-04 09:55:10,imbndc,Who is human and who is not? I've gone down the rabbit hole or is it called taking the red pill?

3838,2020-09-04 03:07:45,im7kyh,Either constant tweeting or dead. Those are apparently the only two possibilities.
3839,2020-09-04 02:33:04,im7kyh,"I dunno man, seems pretty legit"
3840,2020-09-04 03:48:57,im7kyh,Are they fixated on Tom Hanks because he was one of the famous people to get covid?
3841,2020-09-04 03:48:15,im7kyh,I haven't tweeted in years. I'm fucking dead?
3842,2020-09-04 03:16:58,im7kyh,Why is this insane person addressing patriots?
3843,2020-09-04 06:55:47,im7kyh,"The worst thing is for this moron, and anyone else in his band of QAnon 'patriots', is this is now truth and completely unassailable. Tom Hanks continues not to tweet? More proof he's dead. Tom Hanks tweets? Proof that 'they' are monitoring OP's tweets and put out a fake tweet to cover up the execution."
3844,2020-09-04 06:48:57,im7kyh,"Tom Hanks can't die, because who would play him in the re-telling of the Tom Hanks story/movie?"
3845,2020-09-04 05:44:26,im7kyh,"I've never made a tweet.

Am I alive even?"
3846,2020-09-04 03:39:54,im7kyh,Does this confirm or refute the lizard people theory?

3850,2020-09-04 07:46:37,im7kyh,"Even when he was tweeting, they claimed it was a Mosanto-created hyper-clone from beyond the fictional moon spreading disinfo. Tom Hanks could walk up to them, shake their hands and take them back in time to every single moment of his existence to prove the conspiracy about him is bullshit, and they'd cling to it still like Linus and his blanket."
3851,2020-09-04 05:06:41,im7kyh,I spent far too long trying to figure out why he thought Tom Hanks played for the Patriots.
3852,2020-09-04 05:37:11,im7kyh,"Is it just me, or is this mofo wearing a police uniform in his profile pic?

3856,2020-09-04 04:01:48,im7kyh,"Why would anyone execute Tom? 

Also, what if he's not tweeting to mess with these people!?!  

Clever Tom."
3857,2020-09-04 06:33:32,im7kyh,"But ... he's Hollywood. Isn't his execution what these people dream about? (I mean, he's no Rosie O'Donnell, but still Hollywood.)"
3858,2020-09-04 06:59:01,im7kyh,"TIL that Tom Hanks plays for the New England Patriots.  

I wonder what position..."
3859,2020-09-04 07:00:01,im7kyh,No no. To me this seems legit enough.
3860,2020-09-04 10:03:12,im7kyh,"Guys, I never tweeted, do you need any more proof I was never alive?"
3861,2020-09-04 10:11:55,im7kyh,I haven't tweeted since 2016. I can't even remember my Twitter password. Does this mean I AM DEAD? OH GOD
3862,2020-09-04 04:04:38,im7kyh,Those look like some comfortable shoes
3863,2020-09-04 07:52:11,im7kyh,A tinsy bit would help
3864,2020-09-04 08:07:26,im7kyh,"Hm, so that’s why trump tweets so much, it’s so we know he hasnmt been executed yet"
3865,2020-09-04 08:39:32,im7kyh,"Oh no, I'm dead"
3866,2020-09-04 08:41:56,im7kyh,Well I'm convinced....
3867,2020-09-04 09:04:21,im7kyh,I knew it..Tommy was in too deep! Also: Is that man wearing a police uniform?......
3868,2020-09-04 09:17:51,im7kyh,"I've never tweeted,  thus I was never born"
3869,2020-09-04 09:23:09,im7kyh,I haven't tweeted does that mean I don't exist?
3870,2020-09-04 09:41:11,im7kyh,Lol he’s back in Australia for filming rn
3871,2020-09-04 09:49:42,im7kyh,Wtf is executing Tom Hanks? Did I miss something?
3872,2020-09-04 09:55:46,im7kyh,So that means Stan Lee is..ALIVE ??

3874,2020-09-04 10:00:56,im7kyh,"Nope, story checks out. No need for anyone to look anymore into this"
3875,2020-09-04 10:21:49,im7kyh,He and his wife were treated from COVID-19 here in Australia. He was making a movie. I'm not surprised that he is taking it quiet while he has the opportunity.
3876,2020-09-04 10:23:26,im7kyh,He posted on Instagram like less than a week ago lmao
3877,2020-09-04 10:59:35,im7kyh,I thought I read somewhere Tom Hanks recently became a citizen of Greese
3878,2020-09-04 11:14:38,im7kyh,What about actor Tom Brady?
3879,2020-09-04 13:29:18,im7kyh,Tft when a candidate is actually being in real life and not being and influencial fat man that only cares about his people opinion

3883,2020-09-04 15:41:06,im7kyh,"I had someone say to me that Tom Hanks is a pedophile & the proof is that he isn't defending himself from the accusations. I said, why would he defend himself from some bullshit someone made up? I wouldn't defend myself to Twitter either. This dude made a million movies for our entertainment & all of a sudden he's on trial in the court of public opinion. This dude left & went about his business cuz he's got the money & the means to do so. Why tf would he waste his time on Twitter talking to straight morons."

3886,2020-09-04 17:32:04,im7kyh,I have never sent a tweet. At this point I think it's pretty much settled that I never existed at all.
3887,2020-09-04 18:13:58,im7kyh,a body would be some pretty good proof
3888,2020-09-04 19:55:39,im7kyh,I thought it was insane because he meant the patriots Tom Brady and was saying Tom hanks at first
3889,2020-09-04 21:15:14,im7kyh,He was on conan o briens podcast a few weeks back
3890,2020-09-04 21:31:49,im7kyh,"If you look at the state of comments in his last few tweets, its pretty obvious why he left Twitter. It was just full of qanon morons"

Then Q conspiracy followers picked up on it and decided he's definitely a pedophile who is part of the cabal and all his goofy photos of random gloves he finds were secret messages to the celebrity Democrat pedophile sex rings that he is 100% a part of.

It's really bizarre and this has been going on for a few years now I think."

It always struck me as weird as to how Hanks contracted a virus when only 143 people out of 25 million had the disease and in the Gold Coast area that indicated all cases were from travel outside the country well after his anouncement.  Some BS article indicates it was traveling to Australia from the US, but considering that Hanks was at the AMA on February 9th and 95% of all cases present after 11 days and he was listed as being onset in February, the claim is dubious at best.

4091,2020-09-03 20:40:34,im08z4,For sure!
4092,2020-09-03 20:39:57,im08z4,"Tombstone. Of course!  
And Demolition man is a guilty pleasure of mine. I LOVE how Sandra Bullock looks in that movie!"
4093,2020-09-03 20:40:20,im08z4,I love Drive.

I edited it and just left the names.  
It's amazing his first two movies where such amazing masterpieces."
4095,2020-09-04 20:47:24,im08z4,Well... then you gotta love Tarantino!
4096,2020-09-04 14:22:55,im08z4,"Nah, it's not. That would go to the first one."
4097,2020-09-05 09:18:55,im08z4,Maybe
4098,2020-09-03 20:14:49,im08z4,But mostly because my wife really loves it.

4100,2020-09-04 22:48:32,im08z4,"i had never heard of it until my uncle showed it to me. it's definetly my favorite due to it's lack of songs, great story and funny characters."

4102,2020-09-03 20:40:40,im08z4,"ha ha So, you're the one who liked Ford's narration in the original cinema release? I saw the Directors Cut in a Spectrum Odeon release in the early 90s being lucky enough to live in a city where they were generous enough to do so(Houston)& I was blown away in toto, whereas before that I saw the original release & was just intrigued. Make sense? Still a ""good"" movie in its original form but mo betta by far in DC or Final Cut form imo. Yes? One has to agree at this point...

*do not be ""auteur"" on this-lol*"
4103,2020-09-03 20:51:48,im08z4,"And with Wahlberg's movie, I just get so much anxiety and anger towards the self-destructive nature of the character. What I really love in that movie are the supporting characters like Goodman and the black druglord."
4104,2020-09-03 23:13:37,im08z4,I really dig movies that have a solid ensemble cast. Marigold Hotel fits that bill for me too.
4105,2020-09-03 20:39:59,im08z4,Yes. Definitely vampire.
4106,2020-09-03 22:05:16,im08z4,I think we ALL love the way she looks in that movie.
4107,2020-09-05 01:45:04,im08z4,"Ooh, didnt notice at first! Shawshank really need a lot more recongnition!"
4108,2020-09-05 03:11:38,im08z4,"Yeah, I've been meaning to marathon his films. Only finished Reservoir Dog at the moment, which was great and I quite enjoyed it"
4109,2020-09-04 14:32:57,im08z4,A good chunk of FOTR is exposition. And I don't think it has a strong a sense of dramatic and thematic resolution as TTT. Still love the ending of course. But TTT as pretty much all story and drama right from the start. Plus the mutiple storylines give it a pretty brisk pace too. The theatrical cut of TTT is a near perfect movie imo.
4110,2020-09-03 20:41:31,im08z4,cool!
4111,2020-09-03 20:38:24,im08z4,The Hero figure. yes. I love to be inspired. Honor and Loyalty. As well as Love.

4131,2020-09-03 11:23:25,ilr5h2,They kept showing Tom Hanks during Gervais monologue because Hanks hates Gervais and the media thrive on controversy. They spent a week making a big deal out of it for ratings. I doubt Gervais worked out a deal to have that specific camera turn on and zoom in on Hanks during that specific joke. He doesn't have control over the awards show. The network does. The same network that benefits from showing movies by the people you're saying they're trying to expose. There's no benefit to them to expose a pedophile ring.
4132,2020-09-03 11:23:12,ilr5h2,"Ronan Farrow did incredibly brave and dangerous research to release a 500 page book exposing Harvey Weinsteins gross casting couch rape tactics. I'd like to see someone do the same amount of brave thorough research about Hanks or whoever else they think is up to no good. 

I'm skeptical of the Gervais golden globes speech because that was the 6th time they invited him to roast them and mostly he just bashed them for knowing about Harvey without speaking up. He didn't accuse any other star of a specific crime."
4133,2020-09-03 12:23:12,ilr5h2,"Their symbolism will be their downfall. Nah I'm kidding. That was Gervais best roast ever. But other than Epstein and Weinstein, who did he expose really?"

4146,2020-09-02 18:12:23,il8q8o,Unconnected things seem connected in the mind of someone with schizophrenia. But even for a schizoid these are a stretch.
4147,2020-09-02 21:34:27,il8q8o,Who knew “state attorney” would be a fitting career path for schizoids? Connecting unconnected events and showing them as evidence is all in a days work for the prosecutor.
4148,2020-09-02 15:58:05,il8ijq,"I really feel for you.  I am so sorry you are going through this. I hope you friend comes out of this. 

I feel the same way about my partner....super smart and I always thought he was strong and connected....but he told me last night that I am sheep and he doesn’t want to be with me anymore. He said he is moving out. He seems like a different man....he used to be peace and love and light and now he is so angry at masks, control, and all the Q nonsense. I have no idea how he can believe all of this. He is ready to leave his family for this. 😭😭😭"

The compassion and the caring isn’t working. I’ve gotten to the point where I even belittle him and I know that is wrong, but I just can’t take it anymore. My last communication to him was basically “I look forward to the day where we can talk again as the friends we used to be.”

Now when he texts me about some Q bullshit, I basically don’t answer him anymore. 

I do hope he comes to his senses at some point."
4150,2020-09-02 23:13:55,il8ijq,"That's so unfortunate, I don't know what to say. I wonder if your friend's new Q circle would be prepared to assist them if you cut them away."

His response was ""I am not interested in discussing fluffy nonsense with you"". I have never belittled him directly but what sparked the final split was me posting on my FB 'Is anyone on my friends list actually normal?'. He, in his paranoid and sensitive state immediately thought this was aimed at him and this is when he commenced his character assassination. Apparently I am in a 'prison of my own mind' and in a 'sad world'. I can think of nothing sadder than spending 24 hrs online watching content about abuse, satanism and the impending darkness that he believes will be upon us soon!"
4155,2020-09-03 10:00:15,il8ijq,He did the cutting. Deleted and blocked on FB and blocked on whatsapp before I had a chance to reply to his last and nastiest of texts. Coward.

A Ghost Story - Existential drama about death and the afterlife.

Frances Ha - Slice of life dramedy about an aimless young woman coursing through her average life.

Piranha 3D - Hilarious horror-comedy that just refuses to adhere to any sense of decency or good taste. Extremely violent and extremely entertaining.

Crawl - A delightful horror-thriller creature flick about a woman who gets trapped in a house with an alligator. Really pushes its limited location to extremes that makes for a staggeringly fun movie.

The Blackcoat’s Daughter/February - Moody, suspenseful horror about two mysterious girls being influenced by a dark force.

A while back the PedoGate sub had a member arrested for possession of child pornography and the dude himself admitted to being attracted to kids. 

Regarding Tom Hanks, essentially anything he does is signalling global paedophile networks, his quarantine due to coronavirus was actually house arrest for molesting kids, him taking photos of random things on the sidewalks is signalling to paedophiles as to where and when they can rape the next kid, the usual ""adrenochrome"" nonsense..."

They are going to commercialize space and they are going to finish testing this fall.

Some examples:

Would NASA of signed the agreement with VG if they didn’t feel confident in the company getting the FAA certification?

Would Chamath of invested in VG if he wasn’t confident in the company?

Would Virgin Galactic be working on 2 more SpaceshipTwos (for a total of 5) right now if they weren’t confident about getting the FAA licence?

Would VG and TSC be on a massive hiring spree if they were not confident?

Would all 8 analysis put a buy rating if they were not confident ?

Would Micheal Coliglazier who is a 30 year veteran of Disney and president of Disney Parks international left if he didn’t believe in the company?

Would Whitesides stepped aside to CSO if he wasn’t confident that the company’s testing phase is near done and translation to a new CEO to work on marketing and commercializing space if they were not ready?

Engineering as well but Ford, Volkswagen etc had for sure better engineers but perhaps some of them left to work for Tesla just because of Elon Musk who at the end manage to get the most skilled people around the world who build the most efficient factories and none of this would be possible if a great executive didn't raise his voice and said things that had to be said.

4264,2020-10-10 13:12:11,j8cvl0,"In that case, wait until next year, you will see revenue and a market then.

4266,2020-10-10 14:46:49,j8cvl0,Yeah all the technical analysis show a huge uptick in the stock ... $36-45 actually.   The company needs to have a successful powered test flight to make that happen.

4276,2020-10-11 19:01:59,j8cvl0,They will disappoint us again. Bet on it
4277,2020-10-10 19:35:01,j8cvl0,"My apologies. I just checked their latest quarterly report, and they've collected $80M in deposits across those 600 reservations, not $150M. So if 1/3 of the reservations (200 people) have paid their full ticket, accounting for half that deposit money, then on average, everybody else has so far paid $100K. My point stands."
4278,2020-10-11 20:29:13,j8cvl0,"They need to prove they can execute a scalable business they can operate multiple spaceships out of multiple spaceports operating worldwide.  With Micheal Coliglazier as CEO I am confident.

For now, they need to execute in commercialization of suborbital space by finishing the final test flights and sending Richard Branson up."
4279,2020-10-10 15:43:05,j8cvl0,Then you have done very well
4280,2020-10-10 15:42:49,j8cvl0,"That test flight is required for FAA certification for them to send paying passengers to space.  They will have one more after (not necessary but they want to have one more before they fly Richard) 

The flight means they are done testing and moving to commercializing space"
4281,2020-10-10 17:10:43,j8cvl0,"The anticipation to the spaceship cabin unveiling was enough to bring it up, although it was a bit of a let down. A flight with Richard Branson could draw a lot of attention"
4282,2020-10-10 17:13:55,j8cvl0,"I dunno about OP, but I'm saying that. Of course, its not just a test flight. Cabin reveal should happen at the same time, followed soon after by FAA certification to fly paying customers."
4283,2020-10-11 20:27:27,j8cvl0,"The flight window starts on October 22nd and in accordance with the SEC filing in August the plan is to have both powered test flights in the fall, so as long as they fulfil that by December 20th, they are on schedule.

Very excited about what this company will do for humanity and the space industry! They"
4284,2020-10-11 20:23:02,j8cvl0,"They will be fine.  Perhaps a week or month delay on the powered flight, but they will deliver. They are still on schedule to have two powered test flights by end of fall season.

Then to open commercial operations they will fly  Richard Branson and the 600 celebrities who reserved tickets.  Many of whom are A list celebrities who will bring a lot of attention to the company.

I am also confident in a micheal Coliglazier’s ability to scale the business.

I am also confident in George Whitesides ability to continue developing full orbital spaceships 🚀"
4285,2020-10-11 20:36:39,j8cvl0,I am confident in colglazier as well. I just don’t think the stock price will go to $125 - $250 in 2021. It will likely take longer

4294,2020-10-10 05:47:56,j84z4q,"Thanks for sharing.

I assume the teams did really well. 

Would have got 9 the first round, 8 in the second(but I do like having to grind gears for the countries), likely 5 on the music, all the movies and the bonus, 6 on the last one. 

How did you host it?"
4295,2020-10-11 11:12:17,j84z4q,"Great quiz, just used it on a Zoom with friends - thanks so much for sharing!"

It's so stupid but I can't stop watching it for some reason.  Perhaps it's because Tom Hanks is always so likable."

4316,2020-10-09 03:17:21,j7oniz,"Nice to see Scream come 3rd overall, though disappointing that it didn't actually win anything.

But hey, Fargo rocks! Think this is the Coens' second major victory here - I mean, *damn*, it *swept* those awards. Curious if Big Lebowski will this well when we get to that."
4317,2020-10-09 20:00:56,j7oniz,"Easy Fargo wins.

1997 BP predictions: Men in Black, Good Will Hunting, **Boogie Nights**, Titanic, Perfect Blue, Princess Mononoke, Jackie Brown, LA Confidential, Starship Troopers, and Lost Highway. Hercules or Face/Off wouldn’t surprise me, either."
4318,2020-10-09 10:44:51,j7oniz,"Big Lebowski is contending with Saving Private Ryan and The Truman Show for major awards (all would be in Original Screenplay, and Bridges is fending off against not just Carrey and Hanks but also Ed Norton) so it probably won't dominate like it did here. That said I think it'll get some stuff - John Goodman is a good call for another Supporting Actor win and it has strong shots at Ensemble Cast and Soundtrack."

4322,2020-10-09 00:22:11,j7on6s,Not really feeling the win for William H Macy. Idk it just doesn't seem like the type of performance that warrants a Oscar. I suppose it's partly due to people voting Fargo in every category.
4323,2020-10-09 02:43:44,j7on6s,"It's admittedly a pretty poor slate for animated but I'm surprised that The Hunchback of Notre Dame won so handily. Outside of the music, it's one of Disney's weakest efforts."
4324,2020-10-09 05:33:54,j7on6s,"So if I remember correctly, Life Is Beautiful is eligible for 1997, right?"
4325,2020-10-09 16:00:15,j7on6s,"I love Fargo and voted for it in a lot of categories, but it winning pretty much everything is a little lame to me."
4326,2020-10-09 03:52:31,j7on6s,Yeah...very easily could’ve been a three way tie.
4327,2020-10-09 10:36:32,j7on6s,"10 still the ceiling for 90s films so far - let's see if Titanic can break that, I'll be pushing for it in most categories it gets nominated for."
4328,2020-10-09 02:46:03,j7on6s,Agreed. Cruise does himself a disservice here; he's so natural in the role that he makes it look a lot easier than it is.
4329,2020-10-09 00:35:13,j7on6s,I would say Cruise is a safe bet for Magnolia. Michael Clarke Duncan and Haley Joel Osment will probably go #2 and #3.
4330,2020-10-09 08:17:49,j7on6s,It's obvious that not enough people here have seen Shine.
4331,2020-10-09 07:50:10,j7on6s,"It’s far and away Disney’s most ambitious animated film of the 90’s. It has incredibly dark themes, it has morally complex characters, it’s visually stunning, Frollo is the best Disney villain, it has such an epic atmosphere. It definitely has its flaws but it’s my favourite Disney film simply because of how audacious it is. Can you imagine Disney making a film like that now? Especially with Frollo’s creepiness towards Esmeralda."
4332,2020-10-09 03:57:03,j7on6s,Personally I think the opposite. It's in my top 5 animated Disney movies. However I completely understand if people think it's not good because the tonal issues are very apparent. I don't see it among the weakest even considering that though. Disney's dark ages (70s-80s and 00s) have several simply unenjoyable movies.
4333,2020-10-09 05:44:27,j7on6s,Correct because it was released late December 1997 in Italy.
4334,2020-10-09 00:57:08,j7on6s,"Considering this is Reddit, I wouldn't be surprised at all if Brad Pitt ends up winning it for Fight Club. Although it's possible he'll be nominated in lead instead."
4335,2020-10-09 19:56:57,j7on6s,"Exactly why this movie's so amazing. Disney would never dare to approach anything near Hellfire nowadays. I'd say Beauty and the Beast is their most ambitious animated film of that time period, but Hunchback is easily the most unique in the bunch and deserves more recognition for how risky it was. Also, Frollo makes this movie."
4336,2020-10-09 01:31:02,j7on6s,Pitt should definitely be in lead if he gets in
4337,2020-10-09 10:37:42,j7on6s,"Yeah, he and Ed Norton are on my ballot for lead along with Carrey, Spacey and Damon. Supporting I have Cruise, Duncan, Law, Osment... and John Malkovich."
4338,2020-10-09 05:15:49,j7ojpi,"I had a dream several years ago involving Tom Hanks saving me when a windstorm picked me up off the ground and I hit the side of a huge brick apartment building. Tom pulled me inside through a window, looking like his character in Castaway. Vividly remember being on a sidewalk next to the building and seeing magazine pages/ads being blown around before the wind took me."
4339,2020-10-09 15:46:04,j7ojpi,"You may not have a strong physical attraction to Tom but you may have another form of attraction to him. Maybe his acting abilities.  

I doubt he lives in an old place.  Nor do you live in a ghetto.

You just saw the reality of life.  Everything fabulous really isn't what you think it is.  There's violence and danger lurking in your neighborhood though."
4340,2020-10-09 12:01:04,j7ojpi,Tom Hanks is a paedophile
4341,2020-10-09 20:42:15,j7ojpi,"I could actually see an apartment like that being Tom Hanks & creepy friends lair where they do their unspeakable perversities. You being a lot younger would fit the dream scenario. Walking home through the ghetto symbolizes the spiritual & sexual poverty/depravity of the place you just left. At least, imo."
4342,2020-10-08 17:20:38,j7gwc6,Guess that ends him doing Napoleon

4352,2020-10-08 22:38:48,j7gwc6,Feel like I've been hearing about (and impatiently waiting for) this series and it's various stages of being made for about 8 or 9 years now.  Please let this be the time it finally comes to fruition.  Band of Brothers and The Pacific are things I rewatch on an annual basis.

4355,2020-10-09 02:14:01,j7gwc6,"I really hope they don't do Cary dirty with No Time to Die. Dude's a really talented writer/director, but I think an issue with a lot of the Bond films since Skyfall (though I did like Skyfall) was the too many cooks in the kitchen problem. They keep bringing back Purvis and Wade, then at least two other writers to change various things about the script while also trying to give Craig, Brocoli and the director creative input etc. The end result is usually a lot of tonal inconsistency in the film.

Like I enjoyed Skyfall, but one of the big issues with it is were it's transitions from gritty to campy throughout various parts of segments (mostly because Skyfall was the 50th anniversary  film and they were playing tribute to the various era's of the franchise etc.) With Spectre, the problem became even more pronounced and the script was super disjointed due to having like 4-5 different writers being brought in to touch up the original script etc. Part of me kind of wishes that the Craig era stayed  dedicated to the grit and realism of Casino Royale, just because I feel like it would have left the franchise on better footing going forward. (Just because I feel like when camp is inserted, you always have the risk of leaning too heavily on it and going full Die Another Day or reverting to the Moore era Bond)."
4356,2020-10-09 02:49:04,j7gwc6,"Hasnt this been in the pipeline for a long time?

Also, idk if this is an unpopular opinion, but I thought The Pacific was a better show than BOB."

4363,2020-10-08 21:59:43,j7gwc6,Interesting choice! Hope we get some aerial oner's to rival the True Detective house raid one.
4364,2020-10-08 22:42:01,j7gwc6,Awesome! There are still so many great stories to tell from WWII.
4365,2020-10-08 23:12:53,j7gwc6,So they are finally making this show. I have been reading news about this for years and now they got a big name for director chair. Fukunaga is a great director. Although he is preying on young actresses so he isn't much likable but this is Hollywood afterall.
4366,2020-10-09 01:51:57,j7gwc6,Holy shit. They did a teaser for that thing years ago.
4367,2020-10-09 01:57:59,j7gwc6,Finally some great news.  Loved the book I should re read it before the series.
4368,2020-10-09 02:39:56,j7gwc6,"So... Are we finally getting ""The Mighty 8th""?"
4369,2020-10-09 05:00:51,j7gwc6,"OK. I didn't even know he's directing No Time To Die. That movie went from ""meh, will watch it later on TV"" to ""omg must watch!"" for me. If it's as gorgeous as Skyfall, I'd be happy."
4370,2020-10-09 11:47:19,j7gwc6,Hell ye
4371,2020-10-09 17:51:58,j7gwc6,Well this is fantastic news!
4372,2020-10-09 18:12:08,j7gwc6,Fukunaga's a great director and very skilled at action scenes. His signature one shots are always a joy to watch. Is there a reason Spielberg never directs an episode of these miniseries himself?
4373,2020-10-09 01:21:50,j7gwc6,Too bad it's for Apple+

4377,2020-10-08 17:40:21,j7gwc6,"Surprised if Napoleon ever happens... though as much as I like Fukunaga, Baz Luhrrman was the original rumoured director and I kind of wished that happened."
4378,2020-10-08 19:16:48,j7gwc6,"Maybe not. He's been attached to it for years. He said he was still doing it during the Maniac press tour in late 2018, and he had been attached for a few years at that point, saying it was taking a long time to come together. If No Time to Die ever releases, I'm sure somebody on the press circuit will ask him about Napoleon and we will see what's going on there. At this rate, though, he could be shooting this when No Time to Die releases, and largely skip out on the press junkets."
4379,2020-10-09 00:39:39,j7gwc6,"If Fukunaga doesn’t, and I know this might be crazy, but HBO should give that to a cinephile freak that already works for them. Bill Hader. 

I know a Napoleon wouldn’t be a comedy, but Barry is basically only 10% comedy. And I know he’s only directed Barry episodes (as far as I know), but I think he could do it and do it pretty well.

Hader would also make a decent Ney."

4381,2020-10-08 17:53:17,j7gwc6,That's exciting!  Looks like they have a quality team.  This story will make a nice addition to the Band of Brothers/Pacific WW2 epics.
4382,2020-10-09 03:48:07,j7gwc6,What I’m curious about is the book it’s based on doesn’t have a narrative like Band of Brothers or the two books the Pacific was based on. I’m excited though.
4383,2020-10-09 13:41:56,j7gwc6,Right from the title credits and _Far From Any Road_ kicking in it was class. Just wish they've found room for one decent female character that wasn't a plot device
4384,2020-10-08 17:55:30,j7gwc6,"Its been in development hell for like 20 years or something.  The main guy working on it (and it was literally one guy) would occasionally make blog posts or something on it, basically that it wasn't officially dead, he was having discussions with companies, but he didn't have anyone interested in actually making it."
4385,2020-10-08 18:31:12,j7gwc6,If I remember right it was a pitch trailer to demonstrate the intended look of the series for HBO executives.

4388,2020-10-08 23:58:44,j7gwc6,Beasts of No Nation was very good as well.
4389,2020-10-09 08:54:52,j7gwc6,"At it's best, Maniac was some of the most original and gripping TV I've ever seen. At it's worst, it was a real sack of shit. Got to respect that vision though. Performances were incredible too."
4390,2020-10-08 17:36:16,j7gwc6,Recommend Generation Kill after that if you haven't seen it already.
4391,2020-10-08 17:41:34,j7gwc6,This show has been in some form of development for like five or six years. Good to see it finally making some progress.

EDIT: don't give a shit about downvotes, but at least comment why you disagree. Band of Brothers is a great story, a romantic one really. That's not the normal war story. We don't need to glamorize war. The Pacific is realistic. ""O you faught for a few months to control this island? Lost a few of your friends?

4402,2020-10-08 18:51:54,j7gwc6,"The more important difference between the Soviets and and US in that war is that the former actually defended itself and fought an anti-fascist war while the US simply fought for empire and after the war just reinstalled all the Nazis again while bringing tons to the US too.

If they'd actually wanted to make an enlightening and anti-fascist show they'd make one about how the Nazi project was one of attempting to emulate US style settler-colonialism in eastern Europe. This way you might actually get some resistance to the fascist growth in the US going that doesn't just stop its analysis at Trump as a person."
4403,2020-10-09 02:52:37,j7gwc6,"What is this Napeleon thing y'all talking about? A show or a movie? Napeleon is in my top 3 of historical figures that I would love to see a series about.

I hadn't even heard of this, so I just get my hopes up really high only to realize everyone is talking about it being a no go."
4404,2020-10-08 21:17:55,j7gwc6,That would have been insane!

4408,2020-10-09 16:53:05,j7gwc6,I don't think writing women is Pizzolatto's strong suit for sure.
4409,2020-10-09 18:25:54,j7gwc6,"Eww why?? Why does every show NEED a specific character?? Fuck all that. He was telling a story about men, and there is nothing wrong about that.."
4410,2020-10-09 00:33:07,j7gwc6,It was a fake
4411,2020-10-09 14:22:16,j7gwc6,Pisses me off still after 5 years that people didn’t see this movie as much. Netflix hadn’t been accepted as an equal yet by the Oscars but they won big the night before at the Independent Spirit Awards. Abraham and  Idris were fantastic.  Idris was the best supporting actor that year in a tough tough year. But the most pissing thing was that people were talking about American Sniper being this big ass Anti War film. It sure doesn’t come off that way at times . Beasts was that instead and just did a great job of it all being this dreadful journey. Shit even Spielberg voted for Idris for best supporting actor .
4412,2020-10-09 09:24:07,j7gwc6,Eh. Check out Sin Nombre for his better stuff.
4413,2020-10-08 18:55:44,j7gwc6,"Generation Kill genuinely *shocked* me with how good it was. It was almost the same tone/feel as Band of Brothers but in a modern setting, and honestly it made a lot of what veteran friends of mine have said make a lot more sense."
4414,2020-10-08 20:38:14,j7gwc6,"I haven't but thank you so much for the recommendation, I'll get on it as soon as I'm done with the Pacific."
4415,2020-10-09 06:47:09,j7gwc6,"Not a downvoter but... personally my main problem with The Pacific was that the plot was so much more broken up it was hard to keep track of the various characters, whereas with BOB following a single unit you got to know both the characters and the situation better. Story or themes aside, BOB was simply better executed as a show and a narrative."
4416,2020-10-09 02:21:24,j7gwc6,I am guessing that a show about the US 8th Army Air Force will probably have more Boeing B-17s and Consolidated Aircraft B-24s than the planes you mentioned.
4417,2020-10-08 20:11:45,j7gwc6,"Because this new show will cost over $200 million and this would not be profitable for HBO.
According to [The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/apple-launches-house-studio-band-brothers-pacific-follow-up-1246746), HBO earned the cost from Band of Brothers and The Pacific back from DVD sales rather than cable subscriptions. Since Apple has plenty of cash and are already working with Spielberg, they can afford to make this show while simultaneously get subscribers for Apple TV+."
4418,2020-10-08 21:19:06,j7gwc6,I’m literally waiting to use my free trial for when all the episodes of this are released.
4419,2020-10-09 08:11:58,j7gwc6,There was talk of Steven Spielberg producing a HBO miniseries based on Stanley Kubrick’s unmade Napoleon script... when it was first mooted Baz was the rumoured director but some years later reports came out that Fukunaga had come aboard.
4420,2020-10-09 04:14:09,j7gwc6,"Right there with you, a Napoleon miniseries or show that followed the whole wars would be amazing. A HUGE cast of badasses."
4421,2020-10-09 02:12:23,j7gwc6,"""We dropped bombs together."""
4422,2020-10-09 19:16:41,j7gwc6,"Telling a story about men? Sure. That wasn't and isn't the issue but name me a single female character in over 10hrs of TV that wasn't a 2D vengeful slutty wife, a 2D surly slutty daughter, a 2D crazy slutty mistress or a sexualised victim of violence. C'mon, lad.

I loved the show. It's absolutely a touchstone of modern television but its characterisation of women stinks."
4423,2020-10-09 14:51:26,j7gwc6,"Anyone who says American Sniper was anti war is a dumbass. 

BoNN was a fantastic film and definitely didn't glorify anything. It is a beautifully shot movie and extremely well done."
4424,2020-10-09 22:44:36,j7gwc6,Beasts was amazing but is easily one of the most depressing movies I've seen. That is probably why tbh
4425,2020-10-09 06:34:56,j7gwc6,"> honestly it made a lot of what veteran friends of mine have said make a lot more sense.

Generation Kill is often described as one of the most accurate depictions of military life. 

Which is, you know, deeply disturbing on many levels."
4426,2020-10-08 19:14:16,j7gwc6,"Hot take, but Generation Kill is way, way better than Band of Brothers. It lacks the rose-colored glasses of that show. BoB is good, but it falls into the greatest generation worship and noble sacrifice propaganda that plagues most war narratives, especially from the allied side of WWII. Part of that is the invasion of Iraq was a clusterfuck, and looking back now, even Generation Kill was probably too restrained in its depiction of the event and what the long-term consequences of it would be."
4427,2020-10-09 20:33:09,j7gwc6,PAC was based on two or three books.  BOB  asked just on one
4428,2020-10-09 07:04:57,j7gwc6,Who wants to watch a 2nd world war show about dogfights without spitfires?
4429,2020-10-08 20:55:16,j7gwc6,Does Apple TV+ release physical editions?
4430,2020-10-08 22:41:10,j7gwc6,Check out Ted Lasso while you have it. Great show and it just finished.
4431,2020-10-09 05:34:31,j7gwc6,Can we get a new Sharpe TV series with a high budget while we're at it?
4432,2020-10-09 06:42:25,j7gwc6,“Next one’s comin’ faster.”
4433,2020-10-09 22:25:56,j7gwc6,"I wouldn't call his wife 2D she just had less screen time. The mistress is obviously 2D, she was just the fun mistress, she wasn't going to be anything else in his life or the show."
4434,2020-10-10 02:47:33,j7gwc6,Yeah I had to turn it off after 3 or 4 episodes because it was so depressing knowing that it accurately captured military life.
4435,2020-10-08 19:34:06,j7gwc6,"I prefer Pacific to Band of Brothers for this reason as well. It's completely brutal and dehumanizing, and the only hero-worship portrayed in the work is in service of showing how misguided that kind of propaganda is.

I'd love for this production team to tackle the Eastern front of WWII in a big way. Chernobyl showed that western audiences will go crazy for stories we don't get to see portrayed a lot in our media if they're done well. It's honestly probably just much harder because the scale of the battles was so much bigger in the east."
4436,2020-10-09 13:04:52,j7gwc6,"If you want to watch a show about dogfights, 'Masters of the Air' probably won't be for you.

I am sure there will be an obligatory Spitfire cameo, but the 8th was flying P-37 Thunderbolts by then. And once they figured out escorting bombers was more effective than fighter sweeps, especially with the use of auxiliary tanks, they were quite effective."
4437,2020-10-08 20:56:15,j7gwc6,"No, streaming only."
4438,2020-10-09 15:29:58,j7gwc6,A wild west style ww2 story where Timothy Olyphant is a lone gunslinger going around hunting nazis
4439,2020-10-11 03:38:48,j7gwc6,"One of my favorite lines out of that show: ""It's not the Hadjis that are gonna kill us. It's fuckin' Command.""

Incidentally, part of the backstory of Generation Kill is that the reason so many of the officers were painfully incompetent was because they weren't trained for field duty; Recon Marines typically wouldn't put an entire battalion in the field at once for mass maneuvers, they'd send out individual platoons while the more senior officers stayed home. Hence why all the Lieutenants knew what they were doing, while the Captains varied from competent to glory-hound morons."
4440,2020-10-09 15:25:01,j7gwc6,"They weren't all that bigger than battles in other theatres. The overall size of the Eastern Front certainly dwarfed the West/African theatres, but in terms of operational-sized battles, they're no too far off. At least no enough to use it as an excuse not to use it as a backdrop. 

I think the challenge lies in the nature of the conflict, rather than its setting."
4441,2020-10-09 03:50:44,j7gwc6,"Okay, you did it. I'm going to watch The Pacific now."
4442,2020-10-09 13:20:47,j7gwc6,"Yeah, I won’t be going out of my way to watch this in all honesty. Any shows about Second World War air warfare should be about Battle of Britain."
4443,2020-10-11 00:49:58,j7gwc6,And Walton Goggins is the crazy pilot that gets him from mission to mission

4446,2020-10-08 12:22:00,j77ng6,"Hubie Halloween was a fun Halloween movie. His voice was pretty annoying, and I felt it went just a little too long, but other than that I was laughing throughout. 

Yes it was very, very, stupid, but what else are we expecting at this point. Great cast, as well. People just launching shit at Hubie as he rides his bike down the street was super goofy.

If you like the Halloween atmosphere, and want a cheap fart joke laugh, this is it baby."

agree with Kenjacs list more, wedding singer definitely slept on. Happy Gilmore clear cut #1"

Which is a shame. The novel is very quiet and introspective, and only really has one “action-y” scene. I was super psyched to see how the movie’d attempt to capture that, but this looks like it’s really making Captain Kidd less of a grump and adding a lot more overt action as opposed to smart sociopolitical and cultural commentary, though this could just be a deceivingly edited trailer. Those aren’t exactly riveting trailer scenes. Some of those scenes are definitely being invented out of nowhere for mass audience appeal.

Also not sold on Tom Hanks as Captain Kidd. He’s supposed to be a weathered, beaten-down old man in his 70s, while Tom Hanks is in his sixties and sometimes here looks even younger. I think Harrison Ford or Sam Elliott might’ve been better casting for a book-faithful version of the character."

This one is funny because when ""water rationing"" happened in the past it basically just meant that you weren't allowed to waste water on things like watering your lawn. Nobody had a shortage of drinking or bathing water. But we all know how much conservatives rage when they have to minorly inconvenience themselves for the benefit of others.

Forest fires are very easy to prevent!  You rake the forest! In Austria, people live in forests, in fact they have forest cities where people live in exploding trees, and they don't have these forest fires, because people rake the forest!

> Rolling blackouts - done to prevent forest fires, also climate change

Blackouts are very easy to prevent! You just turn the power back on!  Build more power plants with CLEAN COAL technology! Electricity for everyone!

> Water rationing - done when the state experiences a drought,

Droughts are very easy to stop! Turn the taps on! WATER THE PLANTS! California is located right next to an ocean! Look at the map, PACIFIC OCEAN is VERY LARGE! Enough water for all of California! On the map you can see that there is plenty of water, it is very blue and beautiful! TURN ON THE TAPS!

Stop COVID by doing less TESTING! In fact some say you can do too much testing! COVID is very easy to survive, it only kills weaklings like Little Stevie Miller!

Kind of normal, or accepted as such by our culture.

Now he's freed of all outside distractions and interactions. His material/quantitative life has been disrupted. Apart from survival, he now has to adapt to thinking about personal, meaningful (qualitative) things.

>he's transported back to the 'real' world, where he finds everyone has moved on, it's even mentioned, ""it takes a lot of paperwork to bring a man back from the dead"".

But we've gone with him on his journey of discovery and adaptation. Perhaps gaining some of the same perspectives and new insights as the protagonist.

It's back to the real world, but it's not back to the same world. It cannot be because he has changed, therefore his perception of the world has changed. And since we, as the audience, share this changed perception, it's a different world for us as well."

I thought about this. 

Wilson was just a device used by the film makers. 

If there was no Wilson then 90% of the movie would have had Tom sitting in silence because he has no one to talk to. There would be no narration. 

They also needed to part him from it before he could gracefully be reintroduced into society. Imagine he gets rescued and try’s to reenter  society with Wilson as his life partner.

4690,2020-11-08 05:13:57,jq2tq1,"As a dem, I hardly feel it’s pyrrhic, as that would suggest we lost too much in winning the White House. 

I felt joy in 08 when Obama beat Clinton in the dem primaries, I felt elated when Obama beat McCain, if only because it was cementing a promise. 

This was relief. Hard stop. Not joy, not pride, not fulfillment. Relief that Trump can’t be in power anymore. 

And this relief tempered by the fact that what Biden represents is fairly reasonable for the average American... and it didn’t resonate enough to 70 million, a near record turnout for Trump and his message. 

Biden is not out there pushing for regulations on Wall St (like Warren) or regulation of zero-sum capitalism (like Sanders). I voted for Warren in primaries, and would have voted for Sanders or Mayor Pete above Biden. 

Biden is pushing unity and compassion, a solution to COVID, and a return to bipartisanship. Or he has been. Yes, there are ideas aligned with the Democratic Party which he wants, but none of those are as far left from center as Trumps policies were right of center. 

There is so much work to be done to get this country healthy again; millions are unemployed, small businesses are shuttering, and we still have a pandemic to deal with (And a good group of the opposition party believes in QAnon, (I’ve seen as much as 50%, but I’ll say it’s probably close to 15%)).  This may feel a positive, but it’s a first step. And the first of many on a long, hard path to making this the greatest democracy in the world. 

Pyrrhic would have been winning the WH but losing the house (as well as the senate) and having to install a GOP VP. 

This is less than satisfying because a guy who was a pretty vanilla Democrat barely scraped by in battleground states. From my perspective, while we didn’t need to move drastically left, we needed to repudiate Trumpism so that the GOP could tack back to center. We didn’t do that, and so the animosity and so the simmering Blue State/Red State Cold War continues on."

But was part of the Obama administration which refused to pass bipartisan legislation (say what you want, Trump did). I'll believe it when I see it. 

>He’s already talked about setting up COVID task forces

But failed to explain what exactly he would do different. We have a task force already. He mentioned a federal mask mandate, but then admitted it would be unconstitutional. No details whatsoever.

This is the same reason people got unhappy with Obama. His rhetoric is great and all, but rarely backed up by actual efforts to bring people together. Trump's rhetoric was terrible, but stuff like the First Step Act was bipartisan. We'll have to see."

But comparing Marjorie Greene to Galileo is pretty insane. What part of Q holds up to the scientific method?"

4845,2020-11-07 13:55:04,jpm8do,"The THEY was the church. Anyone who came up with anything that was against the teachings of the church at that time were shunned, were considered blasphemers.  People were put to death over less. 

Lastly science.  He had a way to show/prove what he was talking about.  Even though what he was explaining was over the heads of the vast majority of people of that time.  Even though they didn't want to hear it.  That is different from I saw it on line and it fits my narrative.

Isn't it convenient that the people I disagree with politically, just happen to be baby killing child molesters?"
4846,2020-11-07 15:16:13,jpm8do,"Yes, because he had evidence that his view was correct. People just didn't want to listen.

Qtards have no evidence."

4852,2020-11-07 18:28:36,jpm8do,"No. Satan is a supernatural and fictional being. There is no connection to reality. Racists and Nazis actually exist.

Republican extremists believe they are in a war of supernatural good vs evil. There is no parallel on the left, which still maintains the reality of the natural world."
4853,2020-11-07 22:37:16,jpm8do,"I'm still waiting for these racists and Nazis to appear. They were supposed to wreak havoc once Trump lost. You know burn, loot, and murder but ironically being right wing extremists. According to my mainstream media betters that is."
4854,2020-11-07 22:44:51,jpm8do,"If you've never met a racist you live a very sheltered life. 

Your comparison was garbage and now you're whining about the ""mainstream media"" for whatever reason. Fuck off with this nonsense."

Edit 36: LMAO SOMEONE SENT ME THE REDDIT CRISIS LINE. Finally someone gets me. Btw I think we’re like 6-8 away from the end of my screen. Something something “FOR SCIENCE!”

Edit 38: so should I restart the goodness gravy train and pick another equally insightful and thought provoking post like my original to bestow these glorious gifts to? Is that how that works? Can I like start a trend that saves the world or nah. Positivity 2021 wut wuuuuut!!

Edit 39: can you guys like downvote me as hard as possible so I have the most awards on the most downvotes comment ever? That would be something truly special.

Edit 40: FFS that’s it, I’m BECOMING the liquor now! 3 hours later.... ”local goon found dead with pants down in a pile of breadsticks this morning, and now back to the election!”

Edit 41:I’m three behind so this might be the one....it actually just wrapped on my screen!

Bonus edit 44: this is awesome bc my grammar has been ATROCIOUS this whole time and nobody knew I’m really on edit 807 bc I swallow silica gel packets for sport.

Cringe edit 45: now that I’m on my soap box....I hope you guys channel these good vibes outward in your daily life just as you did here today, dead serious. I’ve prematurely judged people in my daily walks for no reason, we’re all human, and you guys showered a stranger in priceless gems for literally laughing lmfao. Silly or not this is the mantra we need for 2021 to make this World awesome-r. More people need to be like you and altruistically make someone’s night for no reason. I’ve certainly learned absolutely nothing a ton from this, and won’t let your literal karma go to waste."

Scaling the business means they will lower the cost by operating out of multiple spaceports worldwide and using multiple space ships.  They are currently building a fleet of spaceships and already signed memorandums to have spaceports beyond New Mexico.

Hopefully they can have a space tourism flight cost around $10,000 once they are to scale"
4938,2020-11-07 02:21:23,jpaoxz,"Buy stock, get an entry into the draw? Benefits the company and the investor!"
4939,2020-11-10 01:20:41,jpaoxz,"Yeah that’s correct.  And currently the only way for a civilian to go to space without paying Attention over $50 million to go in a Russian rocket.

How much does it cost to rent a yacht for a weekend?   $150,000

Want to have a private island for a family vacation?   $200,000

Private jet to go somewhere for a week?
$90,000.

It is not a question of demand, no one company or even multiple companies can build enough spaceships to meet the demand of people who went to space.  In fact Virgin Galactic had to close sales as it wanted to service the customers who booked with them and they didn’t want to bite more then what they can chew.  There have also been multiple research and studies on how many customers are willing to pay for that experience.

It’s not a demand issue, it’s a scaling issue, can they scale the business?  And that’s why they hired Micheal Colglazer, ex president of Disney Parks international. His skills set will instrumental in the company scaling the business.

Currently the company is working on scaling the business by operating out of multiple spaceports worldwide, building a fleet of spaceships and currently they are developing a full orbital spaceships that can do full orbits around earth.

Key will be in less than 2 weeks as they will have a test flight that will allow them to get full FAA certification to fly passengers to space."

4952,2020-11-06 21:14:58,jpaoxz,"Branson's plan is to charge six digit prices per ticket for a 5 minute flight to the edge of space. The most important thing to realize is that getting ""to space"" does not mean you're able to stay there. SS2 follows a ballistic trajectory and comes right back down after those 5 minutes. In order to *stay* in space and do interesting things like visit the ISS or launch a satellite, you need to do what SS2 does, and then go an additional seven kilometers *per second* sideways.

The other thing to remember is that Starship exists, will be flying humans by roughly 2024, and promises to cost an order of magnitude less per ticket while doing a couple orders of magnitude more stuff. For example, Starship with airliner-style seating could transfer hundreds of passengers from London to Shanghai in 30 minutes. So you'd be paying less per ticket than Virgin Galactic charges, and instead of taking off from the Mojave and landing in the Mojave you're taking off from a major city and landing halfway around the world.

But the really exciting part of Starship is that it can also take those people all the way to orbit – to a space hotel, or around the far side of the Moon, or carrying 150 tons of cargo into space. That's something Virgin simply can't meaningfully participate in. Momentus Space and RocketLab are adapting by selling satellite tugs to launch from Starship's enormous cargo bay. I know of no such plans for Virgin Galactic. Starship has already got at least one publicly known paying customer for a tourist flight around the Moon.

So Virgin will need to spend the next 4 years developing a product that can compete and exist in that new market. I haven't seen anything from them that supports that, and frankly it took them decades to get where they are today."
4953,2020-11-07 04:51:12,jpaoxz,"Thats correct. The moon landing was staged. In fact the Apollo program used the Saturn V rocket to reach the moon which had 3 stages. All stages were fueled by liquid propellants. 

Fun stuff."
4954,2020-11-07 12:36:23,jpaoxz,Russia went to space first. Just a reminder.
4955,2020-11-07 02:52:38,jpaoxz,Why did you get downvoted for this? “Should of” is insanely dumb
4956,2020-11-07 00:01:38,jpaoxz,"One of my biggest pet peeves. That and when people type ""noone"" or ""loose"" instead of ""no one"" and ""lose"""
4957,2020-11-07 04:17:40,jpaoxz,To be fair some of those margins are going to be used to develop R&D for the next generation space ship that dose full orbital flights around earth and or orbits to the moon and back
4958,2020-11-07 01:42:02,jpaoxz,I loaded up today. In 10 years I'll sell and use the money to buy a ticket to space
4959,2020-11-07 02:43:57,jpaoxz,That's what I want to do except I got in at $32 Lmao.
4960,2020-11-07 01:18:24,jpaoxz,Are you buying in an ira? Why pay taxes when you can just keep buying. Unless you wanna buy some expensive shit that is.
4961,2020-11-06 21:45:38,jpaoxz,"Time of flight 2-3 hours, time in weightlessness is 4-5 minutes. So no not a 5 minute flight.

You can't really compare it to a starship. Virgin galactic can land it's planes in an airport pretty much anywhere in the world.

4 years? Huh?"
4962,2020-11-07 15:12:24,jpaoxz,"Thank you for taking the time, very interesting. appreciate it!"

4964,2020-11-07 14:11:04,jpaoxz,Agreed but language changes and evolves. Mob rule says it's becoming correct. Just like using 'less' where 'fewer' is required. It makes me shudder.

4968,2020-11-06 22:00:49,jpaoxz,"Are you really including the time the ""spaceship"" is strapped to the belly of a regular jet? That's pretty sad."
4969,2020-11-09 15:57:49,jpaoxz,Except it does because they were the first to achieve something unbelievable. History will remember it. Their space program is also miles ahead of ours.
4970,2020-11-07 00:49:56,jpaoxz,Now you have something even more irrelevant to worry about :D
4971,2020-11-07 02:30:14,jpaoxz,Noone cares
4972,2020-11-06 22:34:33,jpaoxz,"It’s the experience sir.  

Also your assumption that the price is too high is actually false.  It’s a supply limited business.  They cannot build spaceships fast enough, nor can any competitor do so to meet the huge Demand of people who want to go to space.  They actually announced that in the near term they will likely increase the price tag as they priced it too low.

They got enough reserved clients for years.  

The big question is:  can they scale the business and go beyond one spaceship out of one spaceport.  

That is where the new CEO Micheal Colglazer comes in.  Former president of Disney Parks international.  Plan is to scale the business by operating a 1 billion a year in revenue per spaceport.  Also that’s in a 60-70% profit margin.  At some point they will bring the cost down so going to space is the same price as going to the Caribbean.  

The test flight on November 19th is also expected to go 100km above the earth surface, so it will make all astronaut requirements.

Also let’s not forget about the full orbital spaceships they are currently working on.  Also next generation spaceship that can do a orbit around the moon and back."
4973,2020-11-09 16:49:21,jpaoxz,"A dated 3 person capsule ferrying crews to LEO and a few cargo vehicles like Proton which have abysmal success rates by modern standards is not even close to being ahead, and they've got nothing in the pipes. They're financially broke and stuck using old tech, it isn't bad tech because it's robust. The US space program had been in a bad place for most of the last decade, but we now have much better systems than anyone else and it's not even close"
4974,2020-11-06 22:50:17,jpaoxz,"Show me these mythical ""full orbital spaceships"", because all I see are powerpoint slides."
4975,2020-11-09 18:21:18,jpaoxz,"Seething. Again, they were first in space. Relax kiddo, it’s ok!"
4976,2020-11-06 22:59:20,jpaoxz,Currently in development.  In George Whitesides new role as Chief Space Officer.  His role is to lead the company’s efforts on Mach 3 point to point travel AND orbital space flight development.  (A lot of people are not aware of his role with orbital flight development )
4977,2020-11-09 18:27:16,jpaoxz,"I love Russia’s rockets, it’s just bizarre that you’re obsessed with them “winning” at one thing ignoring that they’ve accomplished basically nothing in decades"
4978,2020-11-06 23:04:05,jpaoxz,"""Currently in development"" isn't evidence of real work. SpaceX has open air prototypes, Blue Origin has a massive factory at Cape Canaveral. Where's the progress on orbital Virgin rockets?"
4979,2020-11-09 18:42:08,jpaoxz,I just think it’s a major feat and should be recognized a such.
4980,2020-11-07 03:00:33,jpaoxz,"However it isn’t evidence on the contrary.  Being a publicly trading company means you are held to a higher standard and words matter.  I believe they are working on full orbital travel and they plan to release it once the suborbital flight tourism is up and running.  This is based on prior interviews, comments, and prior earnings reports."
4981,2020-11-07 22:35:55,jpaoxz,"Okay. I'm basing my argument on hardware that exists, not assuming management promises will come true. Why do you trust a Disney Park manager to oversee the timely development of a reusable orbital rocket?"
4982,2020-11-07 22:57:26,jpaoxz,"Because the Disney executive isn’t the only one there on the leadership team.  

The prior CEO, George Whitesides is still there and is now the CSO or chief space officer and responsible for continuing development of the companies point to point Mach 3 travel and orbital space travel.

4996,2020-11-04 23:37:57,jo71xr,"Because thar is based on the theory that people can work together as a community. Maybe the Japanese, or other cultures, but Americans aren’t conditioned to that."
4997,2020-11-04 23:40:55,jo71xr,"So you think Americans are not humans and don't have the natural human compultion to work together in order to not die? Also, where did you get the Japanese from, was it a random pick or was it a race thing?"
4998,2020-11-04 23:48:06,jo71xr,"If tons of people have voted for Trump already, and it being a tight races, that reflects on who are now as a society. And there’s a reason why we’re so divided, and that took generations.

Why the Japanese? It’s an homogeneous society that places community over individuals, which has its own hangouts. That can be applied to other cultures too.

How do I know? Not an expert but I’ll throw it out there - I’m Asian, my ex is Japanese and have Japanese friends from Torrance and Sawtell in LA."
4999,2020-11-04 23:57:36,jo71xr,"The issue isn't so much the people who voted for Trump but the people who didn't turnout to vote against him and that means something, it means that even with a record turnout people don't like this system and refuse to participate in it.

Of all the other shows, I think Corden's uses his empty studio the best because they do have the band and staff scattered around to interact with. Fallon also has his band, but they interact a lot less."

It's about things that were removed as the British colonised and people attempting to have the items returned. It's well worth a listen."
5095,2020-12-14 01:04:41,kcjws4,"Half-Arsed History 

Interesting tidbits from history. The host is an Aussie who peppers the podcast with plenty of amusing Aussie slang and cricket metaphors."

5097,2020-12-14 00:40:21,kcjws4,**In The Red Clay** was fantastic.
5098,2020-12-14 04:28:39,kcjws4,"I caught an episode of Dead Eyes and it was so funny! Definitely will keep listening. 

The Neighborhood Listen: Paul F Tompkins and Nicole Parker host an improv podcast about two residents who read the listings in their local neighborhood app. They feature one complaint each week with a guest who plays the writer of the complaint. They constantly make each other laugh because the situations are so absurd and their improv reveals many surprise (low-stakes) revelations in their friendship and “Joan’s” marriage. Honestly, hearing Tompkins giggle would keep me coming back but thank god the show is great. 

The Office: An Oral History: this is a ten-episode history of The Office hosted by Brian Baumgartner, who played Kevin. It’s not a recap show. It’s a behind-the-scenes telling of how the show came to air and follows it through to the end. Baumgartner  interviews actors, writers, crew, and the creators and producers. It’s a lot more structured than Office Ladies and a must for fans.  

Very That with Delta and Raja: I have loved Delta and Raja since I saw them on Season 3 of RuPauls Drag Race. They’re now a little older and a little wiser. They reminisce about their days as baby queens and what it was like to come up in Southern California in the 1990s. They are smart and funny and a joy to spend time with."
5099,2020-12-13 23:15:28,kcjws4,"Thanks for this list. I’m on the search for good new things to listen to. 

Dead Eyes sounds hilarious, and I just heard about that story the other day on another podcast (possibly “No Such Thing as a Fish”— which is another great listen, btw). I had no idea there was a podcast about it, but I’ll give it a listen."

Mine are:

**Detours** \- Stories that didn't make it to the screen on Antiques Roadshow. This is one of the best podcasts I've ever listened to if I'm being honest. So charming and fascinating as a massive fan of the show!

**Good Christian Fun** \- Two Christian-ish folks have a guest or two on every week to talk about something in Christian pop culture (movies and music mostly). Absolutely side-splitting.

**5-4** \- Three lefty lawyers take a hard look at all the terrible rulings the Supreme Court has made and how they've lead us to where we are.

**Patient Zero** \- A look into the discovery of Lyme disease and the family the pushed doctors and scientists to investigate it.

**Beach Too Sandy, Water Too Wet** \- A brother and sister duo read hilarious online reviews, each week is themed (Targets in XYZ City, Bowling Alleys in ABC State).

**The Missionary** \- Did a white missionary kill hundreds of starving children in Africa? A bizarre and twisty investigation into the activities of a group of Christians who traveled to Uganda to establish a clinic.

**Nice White Parents** \- A Serial/NYT exploration of school segregation.

**The Other Latif** \- A man who shares his name with a detainee at Guantanamo Bay tells the man's story. By Radiolab.

**Whistleblower** \- I'm not even into sports, but this investigation of the largest NBA betting scandal in history is one I couldn't help but binge."

His co-host on You‘re Wrong About, Sarah Marshall, has her own side project called Why Are Dads? - that I find super boring.

Andy Daly plays his character “Dalton Wilcox” which he has done on Comedy Bang Bang quite often so if you are a fan of that show and know the character then you are going to love it. If not? You will still love it!"

5171,2020-12-14 14:55:32,kcjws4,People have a high tolerance for vocal fry because complaining about women’s voices is pretty shitty. Especially when it’s been shown it’s a pattern women have adopted because it sounds more masculine.
5172,2020-12-14 13:21:13,kcjws4,"You suggest a tolerance for vocal fry is a negative. I disagree. As for analogies, if done right like on You're Wrong About they can be as funny as a good smash cut in a show like 30 Rock."

It’s pretty easy to not listen to it and not try to make other people feel dumb for liking something? But live your life if you’re into that kind of thing."
5184,2020-12-15 11:58:05,kcjws4,[deleted]
5185,2020-12-15 15:09:57,kcjws4,I absolutely don’t.
5186,2020-12-16 02:48:11,kcjws4,Why do you presume I give a fuck?
5187,2020-12-13 19:41:32,kcdenn,"Hey man just remember ""All feelings no facts"" lol"
5188,2020-12-13 17:06:09,kcdenn,I remember listening to this and thinking about how Schulz was omitting that nextflix had over a 100 mil subscribers paying 8-18 dollars a month.
5189,2020-12-13 17:03:08,kcdenn,"I don't get this criticism. Those two things aren't mutually exclusive. 1) Netflix doesn't have a sustainable business model. 2) Andrew is working with Netflix. If he had said something like ""... and that's why I'll never work with netflix"". I would get it. But he never said that."
5190,2020-12-13 16:52:26,kcdenn,"He wasn’t totally wrong the most watched stuff on Netflix are shows like the Office and they are all leaving to be on their parent streaming platforms, Netflix also keeps raising the price every 6 months eventually 20 a month just to watch stranger things when people already pay for hulu and Disney plus will just not cut it and they will loose a significant amount of users, Netflix is peaking around this time, after the new year it will decline"
5191,2020-12-13 17:14:57,kcdenn,"It was a good bit, pretending to be anti establishment. Now he got the deal they wouldn't give him in the past and silence his criticism. I'm sure he will come up with a new bit and angle to motivate us common folk just looking for entertainment. But yes I agree comments aged poorly."
5192,2020-12-13 19:48:20,kcdenn,And he still got a Netflix check so....
5193,2020-12-13 22:46:43,kcdenn,"I love how this subreddit dedicated to the podcast... is only used to shit on the cast members.

bhahhaha"
5194,2020-12-13 21:37:21,kcdenn,Andrew never said he wouldn’t work this Netflix and his points are valid and true. Netflix does make a lot of money but they spend way more.
5195,2020-12-13 22:33:02,kcdenn,"Some thoughts in defense of Schulz:

\-He sold them a 4 episode show that ironically is going to age like milk itself. It has major boom potential up until Dec. 31st. Those 4 episodes will be expired content by Feb. 2021.

\-As other comments mentioned, he never claimed to not want to work with Netflix (probably because assumed they'd actually be dead by now lol). 

\-At the end of the day stand up is his pride and joy. I don't imagine selling the monologue means as much as selling his stand up. Not saying Schulzy wouldn't likely put a special on a streaming service, I just predict the network would have to give him a wicked sweet deal for that to happen."
5196,2020-12-13 23:35:33,kcdenn,"A flagrant 2 in basketball is when someone goes way harder than necessary; hence the theme of the show. He was definitely butt hurt when they didn’t pick him up the first time around so he leaned into it a bit more than he needed to but it wasn’t like he was spewing complete nonsense. 

America’s been in deep debt since most of us were born, yet still profiting enough to function, largely off of products and services that didn’t originate in the US. Netflix has had some hits with its originals but they also spent 100 mill on the movie “bright” or something crazy like that & I don’t know a single person who actually watched it, let alone thought it was any good. They threw 15 mill at Amy Schumer for an okay at best special. that recent Kevin hart one I’ve been hearing is trash compared to his others and he definitely copped a bag too. They could very well be millions in debt but stranger things and some of their other originals give their subscribers a reason to stay while a bunch of shows they didn’t create (friends, avatar, etc) are constantly being streamed and generating a huge chunk of the revenue to make up for some of those bad deals. 

Them leasing out bojack horseman to comedy central was the first sign to me that they prolly weren’t doing too hot. They prolly got a pretty penny for doing it but they’ve been pretty stingy with the rest of their hit originals, and haven’t shown any indication of doing that with stranger things or the Chappelle specials."
5197,2020-12-14 16:20:02,kcdenn,"Lets get to the important thing.

Throw that fucken chair out before taylor comes back."
5198,2020-12-13 20:08:01,kcdenn,"Milk ages into yogurt, which can be frozen. Schulz wins"
5199,2020-12-13 22:35:41,kcdenn,"True, but there's one big variable that has happened the last year no one could have predicted. Because YouTube doesn't make content or good content this yesr has greatly assisted, and to his credit he never ruled out taking a Netflix deal if the terms were right he juts said the model wasn't sustainable. This year is an anomaly, once we get back on track it may end up being true."
5200,2020-12-14 02:04:30,kcdenn,"Bro if you said the same thing, and Netflix came along offering whatever tf they offered Andrew, you’d switch up just as quick. Just laugh at situation like Schulz did on ig today

A company he openly shit on gave him millions to do 4 one hour “specials” or whatever you want to call it. That is fucking hilarious. If anything it just makes Netflix look worse. Like taking a significant other back after he publicly humiliated you on joe Rogan

I commend the guy. This situation is absurd, and I can’t wait to see the masterpiece him and his crew made"
5201,2020-12-14 04:58:06,kcdenn,Money talks!
5202,2020-12-14 05:59:25,kcdenn,"I haven't kept up with him recently, has he addressed this yet?"
5203,2020-12-14 11:22:05,kcdenn,This shit better be funny
5204,2020-12-15 10:42:21,kcdenn,I can’t disagree with this but I’m kinda over this conversation tbh lol
5205,2020-12-16 18:41:54,kcdenn,Has Andrew addressed this criticism himself? I’d be interested to hear what he has to say tbh
5206,2020-12-14 00:21:12,kcdenn,Haha! Yup!!
5207,2020-12-15 12:06:49,kcdenn,"Exactly, YouTube and Netflix are not the same product. I don’t know a single person that pays for YouTube premium, they do apparently have like 20m subs(large chunk is due to YouTube music). Meanwhile Netflix has like 200m subscribers paying between 9-18 dollars a month

That’s 20 Bn in revenues and a healthy balance sheet"
5208,2020-12-13 17:47:31,kcdenn,Exactly lol two things can exist at the same time
5209,2020-12-15 14:35:58,kcdenn,"So do you think Andrew ""Keep That Same Energy"" Schulz would still make this kind of a statement today?"
5210,2020-12-14 00:20:54,kcdenn,"Well he said they're done and kaput and he's a savvy businessman. People don't partner or work with companies that are going under. And companies that go under don't pay well, but we all know he made bank on this deal. Also kudos to Andrew! He's fucking hysterical and deserves it!!"
5211,2020-12-15 11:55:53,kcdenn,"How does Netflix not have a sustainable business model? They have 200m monthly subscribers paying 10$ a month, and are growing every single year. 

Their original shows are also popular so they are managing the transition of Friends, Office going to different platforms as well"
5212,2020-12-14 00:21:58,kcdenn,"Honestly, props to him. Hella good flex!!"
5213,2020-12-14 00:36:38,kcdenn,"Yeah, that's the thing. He made bank on a four part special!! And if Netflix was such a failure they wouldn't have been able to pay him nor would he have been interested in partnering with them. If they were truly ""done"" then he wouldn't have cared, but we all know Netflix is the biggest superpower when it comes to stand-up comedy right now. They're even bigger than HBO now. Major props to him! It's definitely a business move and a flex. And props to people like Andrew, Sam Morrill, etc. that produce their own shit and makes Netflix notice! Major kudos!"
5214,2020-12-14 00:41:29,kcdenn,"Nah, I love Schulzy. He's great. And major props. He deserves it!! Was mostly just saying that if Netflix was such a failure they wouldn't have been able to pay him nor would he have been interested in partnering with them. If they were truly ""done"" then he wouldn't have cared, but we all know Netflix is the biggest superpower when it comes to stand-up comedy right now. They're even bigger than HBO now. Major props to Andrew though!! It's definitely a business move and a flex. And props to people like Andrew, Sam Morrill, etc. that produce their own shit and make Netflix notice! Major kudos!"
5215,2020-12-14 00:38:56,kcdenn,"I thought this was stand-up haha. I was more so just saying that if Netflix was such a failure they wouldn't have been able to pay him nor would he have been interested in partnering with them. If they were truly ""done"" then he wouldn't have cared, but we all know Netflix is the biggest superpower when it comes to stand-up comedy right now. They're even bigger than HBO now. Major props to him! It's definitely a business move and a flex. And props to people like Andrew, Sam Morrill, etc. that produce their own shit and makes Netflix notice! Major kudos!"
5216,2020-12-14 19:36:12,kcdenn,Hahahaha!!! Absolutely!!
5217,2020-12-14 00:42:54,kcdenn,"Oh! I never thought he didn't win. I love Schulzy. He's great. And major props. He deserves it!! Was mostly just saying that if Netflix was such a failure they wouldn't have been able to pay him nor would he have been interested in partnering with them. If they were truly ""done"" then he wouldn't have cared, but we all know Netflix is the biggest superpower when it comes to stand-up comedy right now. They're even bigger than HBO now. Major props to Andrew though!! It's definitely a business move and a flex. And props to people like Andrew, Sam Morrill, etc. that produce their own shit and make Netflix notice! Major kudos!"
5218,2020-12-14 00:40:14,kcdenn,"Netflix has only gotten bigger, had more reach, as well as gained more debt year by year. When Andrew said this, it was 10 billion dollars in debt. Now it's 15 haha. But they're still the biggest superpower second only to Disney. Definitely biggest superpower when it comes to stand-up."
5219,2020-12-14 12:54:36,kcdenn,"He didn't publicly humiliate them hahaha. What he was saying was simply untrue. He was just wrong. Netflix was a superpower then and is only doing better now in terms of stock, content, and users. Netflix didn't give a shit because what he was saying was just flat out wrong. That's like saying Trump is publicly humiliating Biden saying he won the election. He's the one that put his own foot in his mouth hahaha"
5220,2020-12-14 12:52:06,kcdenn,"Ayyyyyyye!!! But they done though!! They ain't got no money to give, right?! lol"
5221,2020-12-14 12:51:39,kcdenn,Nah hahaha. Just spent an episode talking up how he's excited about Netflix hahaha
5222,2020-12-14 13:02:00,kcdenn,"Wow. Interesting. He actually made an Instagram post about this a few hours after I made this post making fun of himself! Nice!! I wonder if he saw this or if someone told him lol. Just interesting timing considering he addressed it the same day I made this post 12 hours later, but my post was a week after his announcement. Either way, props to Schulzy! He deserves it! Glad he can admit he was wrong too!"
5223,2020-12-14 12:51:10,kcdenn,Hahahaha! His monologues on YouTube were great!
5224,2020-12-15 16:03:35,kcdenn,"he might still believe it, but he wouldn't say it out loud since he's getting paid millions by netflix"
5225,2020-12-14 12:05:39,kcdenn,but he wont be having stocks with netflix tho right? netflix will just pay him. so if netflix went down tonight he still got paid.
5226,2020-12-14 19:48:06,kcdenn,"On the most recent episode of Brilliant Idiots Schulz alluded to putting his next stand up Netflix. He also mentioned how Netflix was very handsoff in terms of creative, so maybe that was incentive enough to put the standup on Netflux"
5227,2020-12-15 16:13:47,kcdenn,"Well that's my point, for someone who cares so much about authenticity it seems a bit hypocritical, does it not?"
5228,2020-12-14 12:50:46,kcdenn,I mean Netflix was doing well in stocks then and is even better now so I'm not sure I get your point.
5229,2020-12-15 16:16:13,kcdenn,hypocrisy would be saying netflix's business model is sustainable - while secretly believing it isn't. saying nothing isn't necessarily hypocrisy.
5230,2020-12-15 16:28:08,kcdenn,hypocrisy would be saying netflix's business model is sustainable - while secretly believing it isn't. saying nothing isn't necessarily hypocrisy.
5231,2020-12-14 14:17:44,kcdenn,"no i mean from wht i understand in ur comment is that u said that if he's a good businessman he shouldnt make business with a dying company. but he is paid, not like netflix will pay him based on how many views he got."
5232,2020-12-15 16:35:14,kcdenn,Joining Netflix is saying something though.
5233,2020-12-15 16:47:11,kcdenn,how? it's possible to think their business model is unsustainable and also work with them.
5234,2020-12-13 17:38:01,kcd5fh,I enjoyed it. Especially Tom working in a persistent cough since they wouldn’t let him smoke.
5235,2020-12-13 19:44:50,kcd5fh,I have watched it three times during quarantine. I think I like it.
5236,2020-12-13 18:43:38,kcd5fh,"I really enjoyed it. Emma did a fantastic job as P.L. But I'm questioning something. Now I read that P.L hated the film, now why would Disney make the sequel when they know full well she hated the first one?"
5237,2020-12-13 20:22:00,kcd5fh,"Winds in the east, mist coming in"
5238,2020-12-13 20:01:44,kcd5fh,My friends make fun of me because I can’t watch this damn movie without crying. I love it though!
5239,2020-12-13 19:50:20,kcd5fh,One of my favorite films
5240,2020-12-13 20:24:52,kcd5fh,I loved this movie.  I know it makes both Walt and Travers look much better than they were in real life but Colin Farrell was fantastic and the rest of the cast.
5241,2020-12-14 00:15:08,kcd5fh,"I liked it but I hated that they made it seem like Disney was a better person than he was. He was awful to Travers in real life and the way they make it seem like she's crying happy tears at the end is just a joke. Although, I'm glad this movie came out because I saw one of the best comments ever because of it.

It was something like, ""Disney made this movie because they're trying to be environmentally friendly and they want to power Disneyland by hooking it up to PL Travers' body and seeing how much she spins in her the grave."""
5242,2020-12-13 20:32:14,kcd5fh,"I actually really liked it. It's surprisingly emotional. In my opinion, pretty underrated."
5243,2020-12-13 20:04:40,kcd5fh,I loved Hanks as Walt. I would like to see him reprise it and do a biopic on him!
5244,2020-12-13 17:31:13,kcd5fh,Really liked it.  Although I think they portrayed Walt Disney as a much more likable person than he really was.
5245,2020-12-13 19:31:03,kcd5fh,"Honestly, I really love a lot of the Disney-era parts and find a lot of the “Pamela’s Childhood” parts pretty dull. I know her backstory is sort of the point of the movie but the two halves never quite worked for me."
5246,2020-12-14 06:08:56,kcd5fh,I don't think Travers would have appreciated how she was portrayed.
5247,2020-12-13 19:41:30,kcd5fh,"I think it’s a solid film but it’s hate hearing the limo driver is a fake character.
While you can enjoy it for what messages the want you to take from it seems most of it is made up to be just a Disney film and less to tell you what really happened."
5248,2020-12-13 20:35:51,kcd5fh,I watched it for the first time this year and really enjoyed it. I loved learning about the backstory afterwards too
5249,2020-12-13 21:58:31,kcd5fh,Brilliant film.
5250,2020-12-13 22:10:50,kcd5fh,I liked it a lot. Tom Hanks is incredible as Walt Disney.
5251,2020-12-14 04:23:28,kcd5fh,I thought it was a good film. Enjoyed watching it. I wish they would make a film about walts life though. I really enjoyed all the scenes with Walt and old Disney stuff.
5252,2020-12-14 04:24:08,kcd5fh,I CRYED SO MUCH
5253,2020-12-14 04:37:48,kcd5fh,Loved it!
5254,2020-12-14 06:25:09,kcd5fh,Loved it!
5255,2020-12-14 11:53:15,kcd5fh,I got bored and stopped watching about halfway in.
5256,2020-12-14 15:32:05,kcd5fh,"""He played Walt Disney himself!"" This title..."
5257,2020-12-13 20:08:42,kcd5fh,"Yeah, Tom Hanks played Walt Disney"
5258,2020-12-13 21:35:41,kcd5fh,Unwatchable. Emma Thompson’s character was the most unlikable person and I hated every second she was on screen.
5259,2020-12-13 17:31:55,kcd5fh,Waz gud
5260,2020-12-14 00:30:56,kcd5fh,"Tom Hanks is a good actor. Unfortunately he knows this and it got into his head. Great on the screen, a big jerk off the screen."
5261,2020-12-13 23:56:48,kcd5fh,I swear they showed him smoke. I'm pretty sure he says something about it when Travers barges into his office
5262,2020-12-13 19:32:43,kcd5fh,"The same reason they released the first one despite knowing everything she hated about it. And since Travers died in ‘96, her opinion was no longer going to affect them."
5263,2020-12-13 20:28:54,kcd5fh,Because money can be exchanged for goods and services.
5264,2020-12-13 19:15:05,kcd5fh,"Make money, mostly. Beloved franchises are pretty consistent money makers."
5265,2020-12-14 00:08:09,kcd5fh,"You think Disney cares? She's dead. They didn't really care when she was alive, they're certainly not going to care now. They can make so much money from Mary Poppins stuff so they made a new movie."
5266,2020-12-13 21:49:44,kcd5fh,"Like something is stirring, about to begin"
5267,2020-12-14 14:23:16,kcd5fh,Get new friends
5268,2020-12-13 19:29:49,kcd5fh,"I guess that's what happens when you cast Tom Hanks, has the guy ever played an unlikable character?"
5269,2020-12-13 20:09:17,kcd5fh,"Yeah, I understand why it’s in there, and it’s beautifully filmed with good actors, but when I think of the film I never think of that half and it’s usually when I take bathroom breaks or do something else."
5270,2020-12-13 20:30:24,kcd5fh,">most of it is made up to be just a Disney film and less to tell you what really happened.

It's a narrative film for the purpose of entertainment and never tried to pass itself off as anything else. It's not meant to inform people about what really happened. It's not an educational documentary. 

There are sources out there that people are free to explore if they want to know the history. This movie's job is to entertain you, not spoon-feed you facts. 

In fact the film deals with the idea of keeping what's important about the story in tact even if all the little details aren't perfect. That's literally the source of conflict between Travers and Disney. The film comments on its own inaccuracies."
5271,2020-12-14 15:28:50,kcd5fh,What is this based on?
5272,2020-12-14 02:10:49,kcd5fh,I remember the same scene you are talking about.  He puts the cigarette out in his desk drawer.
5273,2020-12-14 03:03:09,kcd5fh,This is correct.
5274,2020-12-13 20:07:36,kcd5fh,Does not liking his hair in The Da Vinci Code count?  /s
5275,2020-12-14 00:09:52,kcd5fh,Apparently he played the bad guy in The Circle but I never watched that so I can't say anything about it. He was also a bad guy in Road to Perdition but he was still likeable
5276,2020-12-14 00:23:33,kcd5fh,I think no matter who they cast Disney wouldn’t have allowed Walt to be portrayed like that
5277,2020-12-14 15:43:02,kcd5fh,It’s based on his interviews and public statements. He even talked about how he is now immortal because of all the big roles he is in.

Gen Z~ Emma Chamberlain, Elle Fanning, Robert Capron, Judah Lewis.

Millennials~ Josh Hutcherson, Chloe Moretz, Josh Peck, Philip Van Dyke, Evan Peters, Bill Skarsgard, Annasophia Robb.

Gen X~ Shemar Moore, Kurt Cobain, Shawn Michaels, Dave Grohl, Devon Sawa, Joe Rogan, Johnathan Brandis, Chester Bennington, Matthew Lillard.

Boomers~ Jim Varney, John Goodman, Catherine O’ Hara, Robin Williams, Belinda Carlisle, Alec Baldwin, Tom Hanks, Jim Carry, Bill Paxton, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Joe Elliot."

And I'm biased but while I understand the point of your methodology from a different comment, UT and UCD are T40 schools. Despite their admission rates by percentage they are crazy well-known compared to the average school, especially for people looking to get their start in-state. Some of the others like Reed are also well-regarded in their own worlds.

Really there's too many people to count but my personal contributions are SDSU-related:

James Sinegal (Costco co-founder) -- SDSU

Carl Weathers (Actor) - SDSU, SFSU

5349,2020-12-12 14:27:51,kbpcll,This is tricky.  Typically there is an age gap but the implication is that they are the same age. Essentially it is often a beauty bias against women.
5350,2020-12-12 15:27:08,kbpcll,"I agree that age gap relationships are largely represented in movies. I’ve also noticed that age gap relationships are easily accepted when celebrities are involved, but “regular people” engaging in the same type of relationship is often frowned upon. I believe age gap relationships are seen as taboo, which is expected from celebrities (old actors, old rockstars, etc.) but not from the rest of us!"
5351,2020-12-12 16:33:45,kbpcll,"One movie that came to my mind was Emma. The leading characters have about 17 years worth of age gap if I’m not wrong

Edit: it’s 16 years thanks u/batmandi"
5352,2020-12-12 17:09:42,kbpcll,"Interesting. It might be because LA (Hollywood and Century City) is also an area which tends to contain the screenplay and casting decision-makers, and AGRs have been commonplace there for many decades. Anywhere there are men and many beautiful young women, it's going to happen regardless just from sheer probability. Plus, casting is tricky, celebrities aren't above plastic surgery, and they use photoshop and makeup to make the actors seem more glamorous, younger, older, etc."
5353,2020-12-12 18:40:04,kbpcll,"Some do highlight the age gap issue, though. House of Cards comes to mind"
5354,2020-12-12 18:54:21,kbpcll,"Michelle Pfeiffer in Scarface. She was 25 when the movie came out. She portrays a trophy wife to a much older drug dealer, but it’s still an age gap"

5357,2020-12-13 09:57:33,kbpcll,That’s what happens when you get an all-male writing room.
5358,2020-12-13 12:45:25,kbpcll,"Hold up, prime? Older people are not prime?"
5359,2020-12-13 08:50:23,kbpcll,I mean weren't Penny and Leonard from the big bang with a big difference? My partner and I watched the big bang together when we first started dating. We have never talked about it but at least for me it was really good in normalizing everything
5360,2020-12-12 15:58:55,kbpcll,"Yes, this.

It is not so much about showing good/working age gap relationships as a byproduct of Hollywood's casting policy towards women actor's - young, i.e. under 40, desirable for men of any age, and beautiful.

And most of the time, older women in movies are denied a relationship altogether. I have a hard time coming up with a film, in which the leading female role beyond the age of 50 is shown with a loving, supportive husband at her side and the relationship (or romance) gets more than a few minutes.

However, there are some romcoms with both partners clearly over 50 and not so far apart, themed with second chance at finding love or re-kindling the old flame: *Last chance, Harvey* with Thompson/Hoffman or *Hope springs* with Streep/Jones.

In *Something's gotta give* Nicholson first pursues a much younger partner, then finds love with the more age-appropriate Keaton. 

Another example: In *Last Vegas* all men except for Douglas are/were in age-appropriate relationships. Douglas is about to marry a much younger woman and is rather criticised for it. He and De Niro then court Steenburgen, who is closer in age and with the same life experience, but when she ends up with Douglas, the age gap is not more then 10 years (Douglas was born 1944, Steenburgen 1953).

So, Hollywood is still reluctant about AGR, I think. It may just be a byproduct of casting preferences in action or thriller flicks. ""Acceptable"" relationships and partner choices are much more conservative."
5361,2020-12-12 16:56:44,kbpcll,"Yes. I feel like you see this even in couples that aren’t the protagonists...like a character’s mom will look 40 but their dad will look 70, and this is never mentioned."
5362,2020-12-12 14:52:58,kbpcll,"There is a clear age gap between bruce willis and his ""wife"" in the movie looper! And super lovely depiction of it (until she has to die for the broken action hero trope)"
5363,2020-12-12 14:59:56,kbpcll,One of the most obvious examples of a large age gap relationship is Phantom Thread with Daniel Day Lewis but I admit that's a pretty rare and blatant example
5364,2020-12-13 23:52:04,kbpcll,Yeah that is interesting. I've been called a creep for dating younger women but celebrities do it and people think that's their right I guess?
5365,2020-12-12 23:30:58,kbpcll,The characters in the book are 16 years apart so it’s really just following the story. Emma is 21 and Mr. Knightley is 37.
5366,2020-12-13 23:57:48,kbpcll,"When celebrities engage in age gap relationships, it is glorified. When “regular folk” do it, the men are called creeps and the women are called whores (or too young, dumb, and impressionable). The double standard is outrageous... and pretty disappointing!"
5367,2020-12-20 07:27:33,kbpcll,Ohh I got their age gap wrong oops thanks

1.  Alito is compromised. His killing of the Trump admin's challenge in PA wasn't for bigger fish, but friends in need.

This is the 2020 version of Cudi we needed. I feel like he played this just how it should have been.

Reading the lyrics to Downtown the lyric ‘How can you lose?’ And ‘forget all your troubles ...go downtown’ https://genius.com/Petula-clark-downtown-lyrics is a message for Trump. In fact a very crystal clear message. Other than the fact it might even reference Downtown Abbey (British Aristocracy ‘elites’ Mi6 perhaps?) the last episode aired on Xmas day 2015.

Now a loose tangent, Anthony Quinn Warner; the actor Anthony Quinn played a supporting role in the movie Viva Zapata with Marlon Brando...one of the key quotes in the movie was between Brando and actor Joseph WISEMAN it goes like this... 

(Brando) Emiliano Zapata : I'm going home. (Wiseman) Fernando : So you're throwing it away! Leave tonight and your enemies will be here tomorrow in this room at that desk. They won't walk away. They'll hunt you down till you get your rest in the sun with the flies at your face. Leave now I promise you you won't live...’

As for Warner, I’m thinking the Stimulus Bill had https://nypost.com/2020/12/29/covid-19-bill-started-a-180-day-countdown-for-ufo-disclosures/ and one of the big proponents of UFO disclosure was ex-German nuclear scientist and NASA Director, Werner von Braun, who was based in Huntsville (Hunter?) Alabama - where he moved to in the same year as Viva Zapata in 1952. We leave the fact he worked on space vehicles called ‘Saturn’ for another day...

Ok perhaps this wasn't so far off. So the supercomputer at Vanderbilt in Nashville works with both CERN and Fermilab in Illinois ( [Fermilab - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermilab) ). 

Fermilab's current project in progress is called DUNE ( [Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (dunescience.org)](https://www.dunescience.org/) ) "" **Deep Underground** Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) will consist of two neutrino detectors placed in the world’s most intense neutrino beam. One detector will record particle interactions near the source of the beam, at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, Illinois. A second, much larger, detector will be installed more than a kilometer underground at the Sanford Underground Research Laboratory in Lead, South Dakota.""  [DUNE at LBNF - DUNE at LBNF (fnal.gov)](https://lbnf-dune.fnal.gov/) 

\-Lead, SD is in the Black Hills. This area of South Dakota is polluted from **nuclear uranium mining** there: [https://www.defendblackhills.org/index.php?option=com\_content&view=article&id=113:americas-secret-chernobyl&catid=16:uranium&Itemid=27](https://www.defendblackhills.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=113:americas-secret-chernobyl&catid=16:uranium&Itemid=27)  (FYI Fermilab was named for Enrico Fermi: an Italian (later naturalized American) physicist and the creator of the world's first nuclear reactor, the Chicago Pile-1. He has been called the ""architect of the nuclear age"" and the ""architect of the atomic bomb"". )

\-China has it's own version of DUNE called JUNO ([https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/powerful-new-observatory-will-taste-neutrinos-flavors/](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/powerful-new-observatory-will-taste-neutrinos-flavors/)) "" JUNO ( Jiangmen **Underground** Neutrino Observatory ) should be up and running by late 2022 or early 2023. Towards the end of this decade, it will be joined by DUNE and Hyper-K...  In the meantime JUNO will detect and study neutrinos from other sources,  including anywhere between 10 and 1,000 of the particles from the sun per day and **a sudden influx of thousands of them if a supernova explodes at a certain distance from Earth**."" (huh, why would they be interested in that this decade I wonder...? Is the sun's micronova cycle about to be up perhaps?

\-From Italy, project ICARUS was recently moved to Fermilab. Was set to start summer 2020. [https://news.fnal.gov/2020/03/they-are-there-and-they-are-gone-icarus-chases-a-fourth-neutrino/](https://news.fnal.gov/2020/03/they-are-there-and-they-are-gone-icarus-chases-a-fourth-neutrino/)  ""ICARUS’s measurements will also inform how long-baseline neutrino  experiments collect and analyze data. For example, scientists’  experience on ICARUS will inform the much larger, international [Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment](https://www.fnal.gov/pub/science/lbnf-dune/index.html), hosted by Fermilab. ICARUS’s liquid-argon detection technology will be adapted for DUNE."" *So are we flying to close to the Sun, or are we mining underground for Spice?*  

 [DUNE prepares for data onslaught | News (fnal.gov)](https://news.fnal.gov/2020/05/dune-prepares-for-data-onslaught/) So DUNE is going to need a lot of computing power apparently. "" The resulting data that will be churned out by the detector will be immense. So, while construction continues in South Dakota, scientists around the world are hard at work **developing the computing infrastructure necessary to handle the massive volumes of data** the experiment will produce."" ...  “So, the **computers need more memory** — not 100 times more, because we can be clever about how we use it, but **we’re pushing the envelope certainly**,” McNab said. “And that’s before we even start talking about the huge events if we see a **supernova**.” ... "" the computing effort is leading to exciting new developments in applications on novel architectures, **artificial intelligence and machine learning** on diverse computer platforms "" ... "" 

Their goal is to establish a global computing network that can handle the massive data dumps DUNE will produce by distributing them across the grid. “We’re trying to work out a roadmap for DUNE computing in the next 20 years that can do two things,” Kirby said. “One is an event data model,” which means figuring out how to handle the data the detector produces when a neutrino collision occurs, “and the second is coming up with a computing model that can use the conglomerations of computing resources around the world that are being contributed by different institutions, universities and national labs.”"

5485,2020-12-30 14:48:17,kn3h9w,"Bonus TIL: All three movies are based on an article in a 1946 issue of *Fortune* magazine by [Eric Hodgins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Hodgins), who [bought a farm for $9,000 with the hope of building a new house on the property for $11,000, a total expenditure of $20,000](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/17/AR2007071702156.html). 

The reality was somewhat different than the book, in which he tears down the existing farmhouse, and the movies, in which an existing house is renovated. [Hodgins actually kept the farmhouse](https://www.nytimes.com/1975/09/04/archives/remember-the-house-that-blandings-built-theres-an-epilogue.html) and built a new house on the same property.

The construction took several years and eventually cost $56,000, leaving him nearly bankrupt, and Hodgins was forced to sell his now completed dream house for just $38,000. 

After the article was published, Hodgins turned it into a novel that became a best-seller, and he sold the movie rights for $200,000. He then tried to buy the house back, but the new owner wouldn't sell. 

In 2004, the house sold for $2.4 million."

5497,2020-12-30 17:58:24,kmvxvu,"Big Tesla bull here. You're absolutely right about how they are ridiculously overvalued. 10 years of monopolic success priced in. And your TA is spot on.

While you may also be right about is Tesla not being the best in every catagory. However they are very competent in every category and do so much in-house that it makes them more price competitive than everyone else. Elon Musk as CEO also means free advertising, which I don't think the other manufacturers can vouch for.

Even if Nvidia has the best tech for self-driving, a look into their history in the console wars will show you that their pricing is always been high and they are not team players 

Tesla will likely be first to market with that 25k-30k model 2 or whatever it's called in 3 years. Elon can pump the stock at will whenever he wants to formally announce that or a new gigfactory. And you didn't mention the supercharger network either - they're quite ahead there and if they let other automakers access them - it'll be at quite the premium."
5498,2020-12-30 06:38:53,kmvxvu,"I agree with everything you said, but I personally avoid TSLA in every way. I don't own shares, don't plan to, and have never nor plan to short them. Honestly it being the most irrational thing in the market scares me, and I wouldn't want to be on the wrong end of the stick whichever way it goes. There are so many companies out there to play off of, I always find something that feels safer (even if in hindsight it isn't) when I inevitably look at TSLA DDs and plays on either end of the spectrum.

The thing about Elon is he is basically the Christ figure of our day/Century. The one people hope will save humanity from self destruction by catalyzing the great migration off planet, and into the universe. He has the Midas touch because we as the human biomass grant it to him.

If any other of his other endeavors go public, I will rush to grab some with everyone else at the first possible second. This is one -- although not the only reason -- I'm so bullish on Momentus. It's the closest thing to SpaceX a normie can hold, not to mention they have the potential to grow into 'the UPS of space' albeit far fetched at this stage to claim such a thing.

I know we talked about this briefly before, but a little sliver of my soul is still hoping PSTH might be Starlink or Neuralink or The Boring Company. I know it's not happening, but still, I hope.

Also, side note that doesn't really have to do with their evaluation, I'm pretty sure Tesla's last few quarter's revenues were boosted hard by selling all the American boomer auto manufacturers carbon credits to offset emissions. (Something I spent years studying in college that I now find completely useless in job hunting :/ sigh). As soon as Ford and the like start pumping out more of their own EVs, they won't be needing to buy as many credits from Tesla, not that it'll really matter.

Don’t forget how many cars TSLA is making when they have been working to ramp up production. 

I’m not a TSLA holder but I really have enjoyed watching the company grow and change a lot of things from EVs, to investing in general.

I don’t think it’s sustainable growth. But it may not crater like people think. 

At some point, this momentum is too much and there will be a fairly large pullback. Timing it is not my strategy so I will be avoiding TSLA pretty much forever."

In general I love TSLA, and I guess my late evening and alcohol consumption had skewed my outlook to the negative side when I wrote the post. I think they have an incredible business, and will due truly great things for the world... but when I remove my emotions and I look at my money, I don't see any upside to them in the next ten years, which means they should consolidate for a bit until the profits catch up to valuations. If I am trying to make money off TSLA, there is greater potential to the down side than upside, particularly post earnings in the near future. In fact I hope they pump into earnings, because the potential fall could be pretty stellar if one were to buy puts at market close the day before.

I do appreciate the contrary opinion, it helps me see more of the picture."

Nah that does matter, I believe this is how they turn profits because they don't make money off their cars. Great point. I had forgotten that.

Anyway, I profit from TSLA's fall... are you saying that makes me Judas? lol."
5507,2020-12-30 19:19:00,kmvxvu,"I know, the stock defies gravity and fundamentals. I do wonder what will happen now there are fundamentals at play though. I think the only reasonable play to make money to the downside is trying to ride a post earnings sell-off. We will see... I might wuss out. It is TSLA, so I wouldn't be ashamed if I backed out."
5508,2020-12-30 19:22:27,kmvxvu,"I don't think it will crater, necessarily. A healthy pull back to a PE of even 600 is still a 50% drop though, so it is kind of a tomato/tomAto scenario at this point. The more fundamentals that come out will clarify the actual growth rate of TSLA, and thus what the PE should actually be... and I am betting that will reflect a growth rate that does not supports a PE 1273."
5509,2020-12-30 19:24:41,kmvxvu,"This is a hard beast to play with out catalysts to speculate on. I think puts for earnings and calls for tech (sold the day before of course) will still print, but TSLA day to day is total black box to me at this point."

I sincerely hope you succeed with well timed puts. Michael Burry's on the same page as you. He also scooped up like 5% of GME to ride the squeeze ;) before WSB started shouting about it. Right now his GME gains are balancing out his TLSA losses, but just like 08, he held on and waited, and we all know how that ended for him.

Oh yeah, I mean the CC (carbon credit not covered calls hahaha) definitely did make a difference in Q results, I more meant that even when that revenue starts drying up, Elon will still be Elon and the cult isn't selling out easily."
5513,2020-12-30 22:36:18,kmvxvu,"Ok but fast forward to 2028 when there could be over 1,000,000 Teslas sold every year.

If the time frames are close to what Elon says they will be (and yes always delivered) then you would see more profits as well. 

I think the stock is inflated, and I don’t know it can get a lot higher, but it may stay in this range for years."
5514,2020-12-31 03:08:57,kmvxvu,Compeltely agreed... like looking at tomorrow is it going to snap $700 and run insane like Usain or crash back to $650 or worse?

5516,2020-12-30 07:04:54,kmvxvu,"The cult doesn't have to sell for it to tank, they can bag hold. There aren't enough TSLA fan bois to buy the dip on a $630B market cap company to ensure it keeps it's valuation. And let be honest, 99% of these so called believers will panic sell once it starts dropping. The real believers bought when it was $30 and have held since."
5517,2020-12-30 23:00:36,kmvxvu,"Right, exactly my point. So we sell calls at the tops and buy puts, and then sell the puts at the bottoms and buy calls... just like we could reliably do with TSLA pre October 2019 when they were still unprofitable. TSLA's current price is speculating on growth that is a decade or more away, and the market typically doesn't speculate this far out, which should produce some spectacular drops as people become disappointed, and spectacular pumps when TSLA looks like it could potentially  meet these expectations. Make sense?"
5518,2020-12-31 04:00:34,kmvxvu,"If you look at the price channel in the post, it most certainly could pump higher tomorrow. It could also dump to $650, and all of that would be within the expected range of price action. Like I said above, without any catalysts to direct price I have no clue. I would, however, prefer it to keep pumping into earnings, it will ensure a post earning dump no matter how good earnings are."
5519,2020-12-31 16:32:14,kmvxvu,"If you want to short right now, you can short PLTR with me... The key to the TSLA play is the earnings timing. The more it pumps into earnings, the harder it will fall post earnings. You gotta be sensitive to timing. Read my latest post where I give an intro to TA using PLTR as an example - should give you a good sense for what Im talking about."
5520,2021-01-04 14:54:48,kmvxvu,"Really interesting conversation. I've been reading about problems with people who have been trading on margin borrowed against their shares and how given that much of this may be concentrated in a few companies (like TSLA) with crazy growth over the past year, a sharp dip could trigger their brokers to force a sell-off, which might be the thing that pops the TSLA-bubble. Any thoughts on this aspect? I know it's not the trigger, but will this cause an even bigger response than impulsive but human-driven market action?"
5521,2020-12-30 23:03:11,kmvxvu,"Yeah totally.

I think selling calls is a good idea. 

Worst case is you miss out on the rise of a stock you don’t really believe should rise anyway🤷🏻‍♂️"
5522,2020-12-31 16:34:09,kmvxvu,"Unlike TSLA, PLTR does not have that much downwards to go huh.. and with all honesty, betting short is really gay. It just sucks, the feeling of it, I hate it."
5523,2021-01-04 15:25:10,kmvxvu,"That is always a risk with companies like TSLA. Now that about 40% of their float is tied up in ETFs, the price becomes even more volatile as there are less shares to trade overall. Time this one carefully."
5524,2020-12-30 23:08:04,kmvxvu,"Problem is I don't own 100 shares of TSLA  at the moment, and I don't have an extra 70K laying around to buy the shares. 10k, I do have. Soooo, if I can get one cycle right, I could play the theta side of it next time. The plan is to buy puts close to earnings and turn 10k in to more money, and then do that one more time with calls once TSLA looks like it is at a valuation that might cause the price to pump based on earnings or some other catalyst like it did in October 2019. Ideally making enough cash to buy shares at the next bottom and start playing theta."
5525,2020-12-31 16:59:58,kmvxvu,Im getting used to it. It is an important skill.
5526,2021-01-04 16:57:28,kmvxvu,I've been on the sidelines with TSLA so far -- and trying to mitigate FOMO as this has progressed. Thinking it will dip sometime in the next year and agree with your above analysis.
5527,2020-12-30 23:51:37,kmvxvu,"I would not advise buying naked puts on Tesla. 

But doesn’t RH have fractional shares you can buy? Does that work for options?"
5528,2020-12-31 00:18:14,kmvxvu,"Nah, you need 100 shares to sell a call option, and you need the full dollar amount in your account to sell covered puts. And in terms of doing this naked - no fucking way, I'd never sell any thing naked.

BTW, there is no such thing as buying a ""naked"" put or call. You just pay the premium. So if I want to buy, for example, an April 500p TSLA contract, and the the premium is $3k, I have to pay the $3k - no way around that, no way to make that ""naked"". Now, you could technically buy these contracts on margin, but most brokers will not allow that unless you have a monster account."
5529,2020-12-31 00:42:46,kmvxvu,No I mean naked as in just by themselves with no mitigating strategy ie no spreads aka WSB yolos
5530,2020-12-31 01:07:41,kmvxvu,"Ahhh, yeah. Agreed. TSLA is volatile enough that would be a bad idea."

5576,2020-12-30 09:17:31,kmobs8,Weird Science tried to warn us!
5577,2020-12-30 05:42:04,kmobs8,"Chet, Chad, Che - They all the same"
5578,2020-12-29 23:17:22,kmobs8,Well they didn't...
5579,2020-12-30 01:58:09,kmobs8,Lol I just saw your exact comment on that video posted like 40 seconds ago
5580,2020-12-30 18:24:38,kmobs8,Chet Haze...
5581,2021-01-01 15:08:12,kmobs8,It’s short for Chester which I think is such a cute little old man name
5582,2020-12-30 14:45:30,kmobs8,Atleast it ain’t chad.
5583,2020-12-29 23:17:02,kmobs8,"For real. This is like an undercover performance piece or something, right? 

If not, does he know Ali G isn't real you think..?"
5584,2020-12-30 07:40:31,kmobs8,[looks like they dont cringe about it](https://youtu.be/r4t-545bS4I)
5585,2020-12-30 19:30:22,kmobs8,"This was my thought too. also, the people hating here have CLEARLY never been to Jamaica or know much about it. Jamaica is a huge melting pot and plenty of white, Asian, brown, etc. people speak patois."
5586,2020-12-30 02:11:15,kmobs8,Lots of people who grow up with wealth remain children.
5587,2020-12-30 01:11:52,kmobs8,I remember when I changed schools in 3rd grade this 4th grader convinced me he was Jamaican by talking like this.
5588,2020-12-30 03:25:02,kmobs8,I still do it in the shower once in a while. Just not in public.
5589,2020-12-30 01:46:01,kmobs8,"say ""beer can"" with a British accent."
5590,2020-12-30 21:15:49,kmobs8,So one dudes opinion is universal for all Jamaicans. Got it
5591,2020-12-29 22:44:55,kmobs8,Big up those numbers mon! Kingston!
5592,2021-01-01 15:10:03,kmobs8,If I were him I’d have gone by Chester and made artisan something-or-others that go in mason jars
5593,2020-12-30 21:54:58,kmobs8,Everyone called Chet is named Chester
5594,2021-01-02 14:21:43,kmobs8,^Che Guevara
5595,2021-01-02 17:25:07,kmobs8,Cheetos
5596,2020-12-30 08:57:03,kmobs8,I just went to find it and he is called Leviathan.. i promise its not me XD
5597,2020-12-31 06:37:07,kmobs8,That's hilarious. I haven't heard that name in forver. This girl I went to school with dated him for a few months while they were going to NorthWestern University. Second hand embarrassment
5598,2021-01-01 18:21:01,kmobs8,OK now I want to see this guy do other accents too.
5599,2021-01-01 16:17:27,kmobs8,"Fuck, Jamaicans are cool. And honestly, I think I understand Chet a little better now. He's just vibing hard with the Jamaican spirit and attitude and wants to embody it because it makes him happy. And they're cool with it."
5600,2020-12-30 22:37:35,kmobs8,OK but this dude is from California.
5601,2020-12-31 13:00:56,kmobs8,Big ups to him
5602,2020-12-31 05:56:13,kmobs8,Say rise up lights in a British accent
5603,2020-12-30 07:37:31,kmobs8,The British accent does not exist
5604,2020-12-30 21:21:18,kmobs8,"No. Its called an example. Unfortunately I can't ask literally every Jamaican ever, so u was giving an example of a famous Jamaican reacting saying that generally Jamaicans aren't offended by it. On thr contrary my Jamaican friend seems to think the dude is stupid, I was just speaking in general based on what I've seen on the internet. Given that neither of us have done a formal survey either of us could be wrong. In the grand scheme, it's really not a big deal."
5605,2020-12-31 22:20:28,kmobs8,"There's always going to be someone offended about a joke, doesn't mean we have to stop telling jokes. Sure this Chet kid seems douchey and this video was cringe, but maybe we'd all be better in a better place if we didn't act outraged every single time on behalf of groups we don't identify with."
5606,2020-12-29 22:57:40,kmobs8,Up up up
5607,2021-01-04 23:04:46,kmobs8,"cheetos. it makes the ch ch ch sound. Jesus, Maire it's not rocket science"
5608,2021-01-01 22:15:47,kmobs8,White and Purple.
5609,2021-01-01 20:58:36,kmobs8,Indeed. He has fun.
5610,2020-12-30 22:45:11,kmobs8,"ok. I'm from Florida. I'm 0% Latin American or Spanish in any way, but i lived in Honduras from when i was 2 weeks old until i was 6. Should i not speak Spanish even though i speak it fluently just because my accent isn't perfect and i forget words sometimes?

my point is, where do you draw the line of gatekeeping language? maybe you're right, maybe a ""dialect"" is different than my example (which involves language), but i dunno."
5611,2021-01-05 12:06:16,kmobs8,With enough money to be in Jamaica every other week if he wanted to.
5612,2020-12-30 15:06:48,kmobs8,"No, but 'a' British accent does, and most people have a conception of an average British accent in much the same way they have an idea of an average American, Chinese or German accent. We're not the only country to have regional accents, so I have no idea why everyone gets so up in arms about this."
5613,2021-01-01 23:54:44,kmobs8,lmaooo that's it! So bad haha
5614,2020-12-31 06:52:06,kmobs8,"I think what makes it kind of cringy for some folks isn't simply that he's speaking in a Jamaican accent. It's how he's using it for no other reason than ""hey guys check this out, I can sound Jamaican!"""
5615,2020-12-31 12:05:17,kmobs8,Maybe don’t try to sound Jamaican when you live in California idk
5616,2020-12-30 18:54:53,kmobs8,An 'average' British accent doesn't exist either. What do you define as 'average'? The stereotypical British accent?
5617,2020-12-30 19:06:42,kmobs8,"Yes, pretty much. I used to be offended by people generalising us, but I realised I myself have an idea of an average French/Indian/Spanish accent despite being well aware there are myriad different dialects and regionalisms in those places. It's also much easier to detect these differences when you're from the country yourself, many Americans can't really tell apart a Londoner and a Mancunian despite speaking the same language.

An average British accent absolutely exists -- in the minds of the 99% of the world's population that does not live here. It is much easier to just stop denying it."
5618,2020-12-31 11:44:16,kmobs8,[deleted]
5619,2020-12-31 21:28:06,kmobs8,"Yes, they all sound the same to the average American, and no one cares."
5620,2020-12-29 21:59:58,kmmeyu,Such a good movie! If I remember correctly it is based on a graphic novel series right?
5621,2020-12-29 22:05:31,kmmeyu,"Jude Law is great in this!
Prost!"
5622,2020-12-29 22:22:01,kmmeyu,"A quality film that is indeed often overlooked. Jude Law is fire in this and has never been better. Hanks gives a layered, low key performance. Definitely a keeper!"
5623,2020-12-30 00:15:04,kmmeyu,One of the best shot films of all time. That wide shot in the rain... insane. RIP Conrad L. Hall.
5624,2020-12-29 21:49:39,kmmeyu,It's one of the many DVDs I got for free in the collection that I haven't seen. After seeing this I think I'll put it in my watchlist.
5625,2020-12-30 00:09:02,kmmeyu,Excellent movie!! Definitely not mentioned as much as I would think.
5626,2020-12-30 01:17:37,kmmeyu,It’s a great movie. Also worth mentioning the less-than-heroic turn for Daniel Craig and the stellar sound design. It’s just a great film all around.
5627,2020-12-30 07:25:38,kmmeyu,"Wait, Paul Newman and Tom Hanks? I gotta watch this movie, like, right now."
5628,2020-12-30 09:37:02,kmmeyu,"I was thinking about it last week. I was finally getting around to seeing 1917, and I was thinking ""Road to Perdition is so much better than this."""
5629,2020-12-30 03:03:57,kmmeyu,"This is one of those movies thats quite good, probably would look fantastic in 4k.......and i can never stay awake through"
5630,2020-12-30 04:55:43,kmmeyu,Yes it’s based on a comic book. There’s a making of on the dvd where they sometimes compre some of the effects from the comic. Like the reflections in the windows.
5631,2020-12-29 22:36:32,kmmeyu,"Yep, i like a simple story told well.

I'm a sucker for gritty movies set in this era as well like The Untouchables."
5632,2020-12-30 01:02:28,kmmeyu,Agreed. Beautiful cinematography in this film.

Wolfwalkers in Animated is the only major thing I think you’re missing. 

Personally, i don’t see Raci getting in without Ahmed. Then, Kaluuya over Murray. but those are personal beliefs nothing straight forward"
5658,2020-12-30 04:18:50,kmj1k0,Wolfwalkers is 100% being nominated for Best Animated Feature over Trolls. Cartoon Saloon has a perfect nomination streak and this may be their most acclaimed film yet. It's a lock for the category.
5659,2020-12-29 18:16:11,kmj1k0,No Kaluuya?

5661,2020-12-29 19:55:24,kmj1k0,"One thing I wanted to add is that right now it might seem like the top two in the race are Nomadland and Trial. But I think News of the World is gonna end up getting a lot of steam, it's a crowd-pleaser and very traditional in it's filmmaking. But also more impressive than Trial. So I wouldn't be surprised if it ends up being between Nomadland and News of the World. Both of which sit on polar opposites of the filmmaking spectrum. Just like 1917/Parasite, Green Book/Roma, and La La Land/Moonlight. Basically, a continuation of the conservative vs progressive narratives that have been forming since Trump took office."

5690,2020-12-29 10:46:33,kmbdo6,"I really enjoyed it, both as an old salt and as a fan of WWII pics."
5691,2020-12-29 11:59:30,kmbdo6,Loved this movie and Hanks was great.
5692,2020-12-29 13:53:55,kmbdo6,"At 90 minutes in length, *Greyhound* is a tense and engaging WWII story that doesn't waste its time before getting into the action, detailing the perilous crossing of the North Atlantic in such a way that it perfectly illustrates the terror and misery of such a mission."
5693,2020-12-29 17:00:52,kmbdo6,"I enjoyed the movie.  It's not an award winner for anything, but it's easy to recommend as a rental.  With that said, I'm tired of seeing Hanks typecast as the leader/hero in so many of his movies."
5694,2020-12-29 17:50:58,kmbdo6,I thought he was really good in the Mr Rogers movie actually
5695,2020-12-31 02:55:18,kmbdo6,"I actually agree.

The character he played felt distinctly different from the character he played in Saving Private Ryan and also Captain Sully from Sully.

Throughout the whole film he looked like he was in over his head and anxious. The directing also gave the viewer a look inside his head by showing us the reactions and lingering stares of his crew, giving a sense of judgement.

Loved the movie from start to finish."
5696,2021-03-30 07:30:36,kmbdo6,"> I’m not just seeing Tom Hanks and thinking “Hey it’s Tom Hanks in a movie”

Don't get this at all. He has zero characterization in this."

5711,2020-12-29 06:50:46,km7uc7,"Yeah I used to think he was really picky about his roles, but looking closer at his filmography I think it's more that his stinkers are so bland that you kind of just forget they exist."

5713,2020-12-29 15:24:32,km7uc7,He's not the type to take on action roles or otherwise super violent movies. So what? Not every actor has to be in hard hitting action flicks to be relevant.

5735,2020-12-29 04:02:20,km5rjt,"In a lot of respects the new SW films are very well produced. The complaints are primarily about the writing, for which the producers certainly bear responsibility, but producers are also responsible for everything else too, and everything else was pretty good if not, in some cases, amazing. The issue is that the writing is a very small portion of the budget and the time invested but is the most important thing about a movie. You have to get the writing right or nothing else matters."
5736,2020-12-29 04:14:44,km5rjt,"For that matter, Rian Johnson also wrote Knives Out."

5738,2020-12-29 04:02:38,km5rjt,"Also, was producer on the tv adaptations of An American Tail and Back to the Future along with Tiny Toon Adventures and Wakko’s Wish.

I mean say what you will about the woman, but understand she has arguably one of the most impressive production credits of all time."
5739,2020-12-29 03:49:36,km5rjt,"Of course she’s a great producer, but you can’t say that there hasn’t been significant mismanagement of the Star Wars franchise during her tenure, so she does deserve some blame for that. 

The gross for TFA was $2 billion, and went down to 1.07 billion for TROS. Rogue One grossed $1 billion worldwide, Solo made only $392 million and was a huge flop. She fired two great directors with 3 weeks left to film, irrationally panicked at the response to TLJ and made TROS which we all agree is awful, and gave us Solo in the first place which no one asked for. 

To pretend like there hasn’t been significant mismanagement of the Star Wars franchise at Disney up until this point is ignorance, and she does deserve blame for that."
5740,2020-12-29 06:59:23,km5rjt,"The problem was Bob Iger, and the accelerated timetable. The pre-production on these things can't be rushed."
5741,2020-12-29 03:15:40,km5rjt,Yep.
5742,2020-12-29 12:10:19,km5rjt,"She has a very successful career, no doubt. I think she'll always be remembered for her artistic failure in her most high-profile project, though."
5743,2020-12-29 05:16:32,km5rjt,"I love how Kathleen destroyed Star Wars but somehow has nothing to do with Mandalorian which is also Star Wars.

Also TLJ slaps if not fully successful,the fanboys just want their nostalgia handjobs."
5744,2020-12-30 03:46:25,km5rjt,"She Produced both Rogue one and The Last Jedi. 

And it seems like out of all the Star Wars fans out there people loved at least one of those. 

I hate the rise of Skywalker but I don’t blame her or even JJ

Everyone seems to forget that Disney set release dates for 6 Star Wars films 1 year apart starting in 2015. 

Carrie fisher died and consequently (I believe) the original team for ep9 was let go. 

Instead of shifting the release date for ep9 Disney stayed the course and paid the price. 9 was written and made on a hectic schedule."
5745,2020-12-29 04:29:55,km5rjt,"That is an impressive list, but she is clearly closely tied to Spielberg/Lucas and of course they created a lot of mega hits. That’s not to discredit her in anyway, just saying she was working with some incredible individuals her whole career."
5746,2020-12-29 05:44:45,km5rjt,"> She also gave us Clone Wars Season 7, Mandalorian, Rogue One and **Solo** and gets no credit for those. 

Considering Solo bombed big, she's probably glad about that."
5747,2020-12-29 04:54:30,km5rjt,Kathleen's legacy is sterling. Nasty internet commenters will never change that.
5748,2020-12-29 04:18:49,km5rjt,Most of those are either Spielberg movies or friends/collaborators with Spielberg. Why are you giving credit of the quality of the movies to her?
5749,2020-12-29 04:09:35,km5rjt,I fucking love Joe Versus the Volcano.
5750,2020-12-29 19:21:13,km5rjt,"I honestly feel she's just people's scapegoat for the Sequel Trilogy and all the hate against her is uncalled for.

Did the ST's plot suck? Yup. Big time. Not as bad as the prequels' plot but still bad.

Is it specifically her fault? Not really.

She's just a cog in the machine, the fault lies mostly in a total lack of planning/vision/consistency which might as well originate from high ups at Disney who wanted to play it safe AND to have a bi-yearly schedule even if it meant having a different director per movie.

JJ Abrahams is also a hack writer (seriously, Lost was THE best example of how much he and Damon Lindelof suck at planning/vision/consistency) while Rian Johson, despite being an amazing director (The Last Jedi is BEAUTIFULLY shot and acted) simply doesn't ""get"" Star Wars."
5751,2020-12-29 20:36:55,km5rjt,"I can't believe you left out **Congo**, one of the greatest guilty pleasure movies of all time."
5752,2021-01-31 20:23:18,km5rjt,"Kathleen, is that you?"
5753,2021-02-11 16:42:52,km5rjt,She and Spielberg are very prolific producers so I'm not surprised
5754,2020-12-29 05:03:19,km5rjt,"Additionally, on the Rogue One front, she's responsible for approving the Vader hallway scene in post-production. It was a couple months until release and she gave the go ahead to do reshoots for that scene because she loved the idea of it. The original ending didn't have it.

Filoni and Favreau get all the credit for Mando when she deserves a significant portion of it. She's heavily involved and does great work. 

Sure she partially mismanaged the ST with TROS. But the story group is also heavily responsible for that. I didn't see anyone screaming for Pablo Hidalgo's resignation after JJ dropped that dumpster fire of a film on us"
5755,2020-12-29 19:11:56,km5rjt,"Producers are so overrated they handle the business components of film making, not the actual writing and creative aspects."
5756,2020-12-29 08:57:30,km5rjt,"People don't even know what her job is. As she is in charge of LucasFilm she runs all it's divisions, including ILM and Skywalker Sound! It is a business job, so stop demanding that a creative like Dave Filoni gets it. He is quite happy making TV shows!"
5757,2020-12-29 03:55:50,km5rjt,"The most valuable movie IP of all time, acquired for billions, a decade since the last installment.... AND THEY FUCKING DIDN’T PLAN THE TRILOGY, THEY JUST SAID “FUCK IT, EACH DIRECTOR CAN FIGURE OUT THE NEXT PART WHEN WE HIRE THEM... RIGHT AFTER THE PREVIOUS INSTALLMENT”. THAT’S WHY WE CONSIDER HER A HACK. Seriously though, she’s incredibly accomplished and does great work. She just fucked up big time on the sequels though"

5759,2020-12-29 04:44:33,km5rjt,nope she is not creative.  She is great at supporting creative.  Half this shit is Spielberg and Lucas not her.
5760,2020-12-29 04:20:05,km5rjt,"Here’s the reality, Star Wars coasted off two great films for about 40 years and it’s just not as great of a property to franchise out"
5761,2020-12-29 15:50:51,km5rjt,"Weird how when she produces films where a great director is in charge (i.e. is also a producer) the films are great.

But when she is in charge they are shit films."
5762,2020-12-29 09:28:24,km5rjt,She hired Lord & Miller to direct Solo even though she didn't like them from the start. Wasted at least 150 million shooting Solo with them and fired them when they were nearly done and had to shoot the movie again for 150 million. What a great producer!
5763,2020-12-29 03:42:29,km5rjt,All I want is for her to not be in control of Star Wars. She does have a great track record but everyone has different strengths.
5764,2020-12-29 09:01:23,km5rjt,"Whatever her impressive track record may say (and however much of it she deserves credir for), she nearly destroyed one of the biggest franchises of all time. Disney bought SW to grow the brand and the opposite happened, which is demonstrably true beyond Internet debates of the new movies.

Also how timely, just a few hours a [video](https://youtu.be/dTVLQq-mqh4) came out to shut up all the sycophants that somehow believe Kennedy deserves credit for The Mandalorian, which is the only saving grace of Disney Star Wars right now."
5765,2020-12-29 11:33:41,km5rjt,"Your accomplishments do not change your failures and your failures do not change your accomplishments but **the accomplishments you list almost all belong to Steven Spielberg** not her so she basically attached herself to a golden goose and succeeded, no surprise here. Clearly when she is on her own without guidance she has no clue what qualifies as a good movie so her tactic changed from ""let's phone Steven, maybe he has a new project"" to ""let's throw out as much shit we can and see what sticks as fans will eat up anything as they are starved for content""."
5766,2020-12-29 05:23:29,km5rjt,This didn't exonerate her from the star wars sequels dissaster.
5767,2020-12-29 03:48:52,km5rjt,She clearly is one of the best.
5768,2020-12-29 04:44:16,km5rjt,All those bangers and she couldn’t produce three decent SW movies. Goes to show...
5769,2020-12-29 07:13:28,km5rjt,She rode the coattails of great directors.
5770,2020-12-29 04:28:35,km5rjt,Damn I had no idea
5771,2020-12-29 11:44:02,km5rjt,It would be more accurate to say that Kathleen Kennedy is a producer that worked on some of the best films of all time.

5774,2020-12-29 04:38:00,km5rjt,"She's an amazing producer and people who think she road on coat tails of others or has no cinematic expertise clearly haven't looked into her role in a lot of these movies. She definitely does not 'get' Star Wars and should not have been given the keys to that castle, but it's not a coincidence that she has the filmography she has"

5777,2020-12-29 13:37:35,km5rjt,"Nah, she still sucks, i worked with producers and they always have a plan for the future and have plan A and a plan B at least. Thinking about issues the franchise can encounter is the job of a producer, so the fact there was no vision for those movies is her fail. Maybe she can handle a one movie but not a trilogy, people can defend her all they want, but she had been given reigns over one of the most famous and beloved IP in history and she managed to divide and insult the fanbase by saying and doing many stupid things, that is all on her. If there was pressure from above it's her job to defend the IP and the product, so if that was the case than again she did a shit job."
5778,2020-12-29 15:23:58,km5rjt,Many of those are safe-bet films if you ask me and understand what i'm saying.
5779,2020-12-29 04:20:33,km5rjt,I'll argue she's great when it comes to anything that doesn't already have an existing and established lore. I think that's fair.
5780,2020-12-29 09:32:27,km5rjt,"You're only as good as your last project, that is all.

Just ask Benioff ad Weiss."
5781,2020-12-29 04:57:09,km5rjt,"Being a great producer, doesn't mean you're a great studio head. I happen to agree that KK is a great producer, and I think the hate she gets that negates that, is crap.

However, she sucks as a studio head. She had a financially planned trilogy of films for a major IP, and she didn't have a story plan to them. Or if she had one, it wasn't executed to at all. Worse, she allowed directors undoing the previous film's story, in a trilogy. That's all just NUTS! and extremely incompetent. 

As head of LucasFilm she has overseen problems with writing/directing in every project she's actually in charge of (she's not in charge of The Mandalorian), except TLJ. The worst of which cost her studio hundreds of millions of dollars they wouldn't have had to spend, if she was a better studio head. 

Which is why I think she shouldn't even want to stay head of LucasFilm and go back to what she's really good at, which is producing. And I look forward to what she'll produce again, and I think she'll be much happier as well."
5782,2020-12-29 17:03:05,km5rjt,Lol
5783,2020-12-30 03:35:52,km5rjt,"One of the best of all time?

Lol, let’s just slap this label on everything"
5784,2020-12-30 05:20:39,km5rjt,"This topic has been argued into the ground and back.  Clearly enough people in power beleive she's capable, so ultimately our opinions are moot.

Though I still don't think she should be credited for Spielberg's successes."
5785,2021-01-01 11:58:03,km5rjt,"Like yes she done alot but how many of them did she have full creative power over?? Because I can definitely name 5 movies who were directed by Steven Spielberg and Kennedy was the women in the corner who ""was terrible at taking notes"" and ""would interrupt anyone"" at brainstorming meeting to get her ideas across. (Quoting Spielberg himself from an interview he had ok Kennedy).

And does she deserve credit for Mandalorion? NO. Because she had no creative power over that show she allow Jon Fav and Dave Filoni to do whatever they wanted with it. With the Clones Wars again she does deserve credit because Dave Filoni been doing that from before Kennedy decided to accept the position to a franchise that (in her words) she doesn't understand why is it so popular and so loved. 

Yes you can argue the case that George Lucas told Disney that Kathleen Kennedy should have the role but she back stab George by not fighting for his script which he made for the sequels."
5786,2021-02-18 11:36:58,km5rjt,"If you look at her filmography, it might not be that she's a great producer, but rides in the wake of some of greatest that are out there."
5787,2021-02-18 23:45:13,km5rjt,"We live in a “What have you done for me lately” era and green lighting The Mandalorian is probably the best thing she’s done. I’d say it’s about time someone else is given the keys to the car, especially since fans of Star Wars are so conflicted with the direction of the franchise atm."
5788,2021-02-19 00:04:38,km5rjt,She should just give up her job to Dave Filoni and Jon Favreu
5789,2021-03-13 17:49:05,km5rjt,She is THE Peter Principle.
5790,2020-12-29 03:37:09,km5rjt,I think it has more to do with who she got her boat attached to—namely Steven Speilburg and George Lucas.
5791,2020-12-29 09:38:54,km5rjt,"Yes, the resume is very impressive. But it's clear she was part of the very talented team surrounding Spielberg, among others.

A producers role isn't always clearly defined and the respinsibilites can vary quite a bit from production to production. Maybe she excelled in a certain role, or worked well within a specific team.

That doesn't mean she's a good manager for Lucasfilm.

It's clear she bears a lot (not all) of responsiblity for how the new Star Wars films turned out. And almost all of them had massive issues, the core trilogy above all."
5792,2020-12-29 11:41:56,km5rjt,No. Remove Spielberg and you get The Last Airbender. She freeloaded.
5793,2020-12-29 15:56:03,km5rjt,Sure she may have done other things but in regards to star wars she's worse than George Lucas

5795,2020-12-29 07:35:07,km5rjt,"She approves ideas and provides money and gets money for creative types. She is basically a Hollywood loan shark for successful artists to get work going. Lets not bullshit ourselves here. She approved and supplied budgets for Spielberg and his friends as well as Fincher and M. Night Shyamalan? At the time, who wouldn't have done so? You are telling me the guy who invented the blockbuster summer movie got someone to pony up for a remake of one of the world's most successful stories featuring Tom Cruise and directed by Stephen Spielberg? What a shock! She decided to distribute successful foreign films in other territories and markets? Shocking.

Hook bombed so bad Spielberg won't even fucking talk about it, forget a director's commentary. It failed to make money for her which is what producers aim to do when they invest in a film production. But let's ignore the reality of the business and what her actual role is and success is built on because 25 years later people like it. You are crediting her for a failure. It's absurd, especially since a Spielberg directed sequel to Peter Pan with Julia Roberts, Bob Hoskins, Robin Williams and Dustin Hoffman had all the elements to be a sure fire hit.

I don't think you understand what producers actually do and the fact she mothballed Lucas' plans for the sequel trilogy, wacky or not. says all that needs to be said about how much she respects the creative types that have helped her build her fortune: she doesn't give a fuck what you think if she thinks it won't make money even if you have before."
5796,2020-12-29 08:12:26,km5rjt,"Yes, a good resume, but she was also the credited producer on The Last Airbender. A quick search of this sub will show plenty of examples why that movie is an all-time worse. 

At the time of its release, it bothered me so much that a producer with her pedigree could somehow not forsee that trainwreck and not forsee that huge slap in the face it was to fans of the show and the Asian American community. It was a downright insult that it was produced the way it was.

If she and Frank Marshall can allow that property to be SO BAD - which I think you have to be pretty damn tone deaf to not have seen it coming - I have to wonder how much influence their title of ""producer"" has on the good movies too.

What you're arguing would be akin to saying that a professional chef who receives a lot of criticism for their cooking ought to be exempt from that criticism because they performed extremely well in their previous job as an accountant.

Kathleen Kennedy's role as a producer saw her overseeing the production side of movies; ensuring that everyone is on the same page, through coordination and micro-management, in a non-creative capacity.  Whereas her current role includes the responsibility of overseeing the creative choices of beloved franchises and choosing the direction for them to go in.  The two jobs are not really comparable, at least not in the aspects for which she has been criticised."

5808,2020-12-29 04:46:03,km5rjt,She is a great producer and a good charge a the reins of the franchise. The problem is the creative department. She should have someone like Filoni at her side to supervise the creative aspect and fealty to the material of the projects
5809,2020-12-29 05:07:11,km5rjt,"To be fair I think it is a very unique skill set that allows a producer to map out a long term vision for a movie series and have different writers and directors all work with the long term goals while still achieving their own vision on each individual film.

This is what Kevin Feige has done with the MCU that nobody else has been able to even come close to. That does not mean that Feige could make many of the films that Kathleen Kennedy has made. it is simply a different skill."

Abrams had just revived Star Trek. I know some of the purists hate the new Star Trek movies, but they were a lot of fun, and the alternate universe made a lot of sense. It was that or a reboot. 

While Favreau had directed Iron Man, hehad also just directed the flop “Cowboys and Aliens” so he wasn’t the obvious choice to helm the series as he is in retrospect.  Dave Filoni also didn’t have the experience to head up such a project, although it’s clear now he could have pulled it off. 

It also makes financial sense to launch Disney’s ownership of the franchise with a new trilogy.  They certainly made their money back.

She also couldn’t have planned for Carrie Fisher’s death.  We know that affected the final movie, but we don’t know to what extent. 

It does boggle the mind that there wasn’t an overarching story planned out ahead of time, or if there was that it wasn’t clear to the writers."

    Her filmography is impressive but her handling of Lucas Film is horrible. How many directors left due to 'creative differences'? Abandoning the EU, allowing fans to be insulted is just in excusable.  Star Wars has suffered while she holds the reins. Many of her films were with Spielberg, and you  would be hard pressed to ruin greatness.

5826,2020-12-29 04:31:35,km5rjt,"The issue isn't even necessarily the writing on a per-film basis. It's that they didn't sit down and write the trilogy's overall plot before making any of the films. They knew they wanted a trilogy in an extended universe, and they still treated them like they were just individual films that could do what they liked without considering the impact on other films (or coherency or consistency within its own trilogy).

Honestly looking at her list of films in the OP, that approach probably worked for all those films. It's not like they planned Jurassic Park 3 before writing the first movie. But with a third Star Wars trilogy that would release over 5 or 6 years? They should've had one overarching story they wanted to tell, and get each film's writers to agree on what that would be."
5827,2020-12-29 04:57:03,km5rjt,"I've mentioned before that I think Kennedy's misstep with Star Wars was that she looked at each movie individually rather than as an entire trilogy.  Kennedy has decades of experience producing fantastic movies,  but she really never did anything where there's an overarcing story that plays out over multiple movies.  Even *Back to the Future*, *Indiana Jones*, and *Jurassic Park* are all mostly self-contained stories.  So, instead of looking at the sequels as one single project, she looked at each as its own project where you could have different writers and directors for each.  The writing likely wouldn't have been nearly as much of an issue had it been planned out beforehand or there was a consistent vision behind it, rather than having the whiplash of competing views of what the trilogy was supposed to be."

Your writing sucks; all your actors suck regardless of talent, no fancy camera framing movement etc matters,  and no one cares about the story you're trying to tell.  Its like the marketing department has taken over the creative process for most major franchises.  What results feels weird(WW84), and at it's worst(Xmen Last Stand) undermines the entire rules/lore of the world their characters inhabit.  Many times if the alternative to what was written in comics/books comes from a clever place of purpose it'll work just fine.  There are many characters I like better than their written versions on screen but it takes a lot of effort/thought/talented actors.  Telling an even better story than the one the page should always be the goal and what pisses me off more than  anything is the writers making mistakes because they don't love/understand the source material.  Its really clear to me that talented as she is Kennedy has dealt a serious blow to SW.  The only thing that redeems her is that her contributions are being balanced by Filoni/Favreau.  There's a writer for NuTrek that wrote ""A Beautiful Mind"" and also wrote the worst trek I've ever experienced.  So past performance doesn't dictate future results.  It cuts both ways though cause you have to judge artists on their work right now.  Her sequel movies sucked!  Accusing your fans of being sexist cause they hate shitty writing might be one of the most fucked up things I've experienced as a lifetime scifi fan.  This has happened in both Trek and Star Wars....and it needs to fucking stop!  I hope Kennedy is fired and they give the keys to the kingdom to those who have earned it.

Of course, this is just my personal experience, but the film is a terribly written mess that seems to want to be several different films at once, and it executes none of those in an enjoyable way. The plot is contrived, jumbled and messy, the characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting and the dialogue is blatantly written ""weird"" because the writers wanted it to stand out.

I really went into this ready to admit that while Johnson did a terrible job with Star Wars, he might be a lot better at projects that aren't as ""executive-controlled"" as Star Wars, but no such luck.

My hatred for Rian Johnson has been renewed and I'm not gonna waste my time on any of his other films. I was planning on watching *Looper*, but that's out of the question now.

EDIT: One more small rant, then I'll stop: what was up with that one policeman being the dumbest fucking person on earth? The detective who constantly second-guessed and handwaved every single observation or deduction Daniel Craig made was so insanely stupid that I seriously assumed that he was involved in the crime somehow and was just doing a poor job of trying to cover it up.

She’s *literally* the president of the company. She’s as in charge of Mando as she was the ST."
5897,2020-12-30 07:24:22,km5rjt,Spielberg however does.
5898,2021-01-07 10:15:28,km5rjt,Nothing you said is related to her job.
5899,2021-02-18 13:10:58,km5rjt,"Even great directors put out duds, but she was basically consistently great for decades. Those great decades talk about how brilliant she is, and she has had success with multiple directors. There is a reason why Spielberg considers her and Frank Marshall his two primary partners in filmmaking, or why Lucas hand picked her as his replacement.

I love how this is the most common response I've received, that surely her success must be the result of men, and couldn't be something she earned on her own.

There may be some argument that she isn't as talented running a studio as she was when she was Executive Producer and more involved on individual films in the past. But there is constant criticism like she is the biggest failure in history and the worst woman working in Hollywood because people don't like story elements of the sequel trilogy of Star Wars. She didn't write those scripts nor decide on those stories. She was fairly hands off and let the writer/directors come up with their own stories. But she is blamed directly for the bad stories, as opposed to the writers.

But for anything good Lucasfilm has done under her watch (Rogue One, Solo, The Mandalorian, Clone Wars Season 7) she gets no credit, and instead credit is only given to men who worked on those projects."
5900,2020-12-29 03:39:37,km5rjt,Yeah they definitely kept working with her because she brought nothing of value to the table.
5901,2020-12-29 05:37:11,km5rjt,Spielberg and Lucas have both made some trash

5905,2020-12-29 03:48:42,km5rjt,"Sure it’s not like she ran Amblin’s two divisions or went from production assistant to being producer on these movies that just happen to be done by Lucas, Spielberg and Marshall."
5906,2020-12-29 04:23:55,km5rjt,"or having great producers is one of the reasons he's one of our greatest directors. Filmmaking's a team sport, and she's part of that team."
5907,2020-12-29 06:05:29,km5rjt,I just wish we could clone Favreau and have him save Star Trek as well.  Down with all the Kennedy's and Kurtzman's of the world!  Hollywood needs to embrace meritocracy to stop giving the keys to the franchise to these spouses or son in laws of powerful people.  It all makes sense when you look at it that way(nepotism)!

I feel the biggest issue that I have with her is her inability to contain various members of the team, weather it be fan relations or the direction the team wants to go with the franchise and it’s brand. Fan relations is at an all time low and the direction of the sequels is undeniably sub par. Fans voices aren’t being heard and some are being openly mocked(Star Wars Theory) and some characters with potential are downright squandered(Fin). I’ve loved Star Wars since I was a little girl, my grandpa got me into it and when he passed away it was something that I shared with him and whenever I watch them, I remember why he liked them. The Force just hasn’t been as strong in the last few years and while I know it’s not entirely her fault, she’s still the GM of the team and just because you win championships with teams in the past doesn’t mean you’re able to win on every team and this team hasn’t been a title contender in years. We need to move on."

He was clearly emulating Hitchcock and it worked. 

It also has the best characterization of any film he has made."
5918,2020-12-29 18:43:54,km5rjt,"A lot of people don't realize that JJ Abrams has been close friends with Kathleen Kennedy since he was a teenager. You know how we made a movie called Super 8 that was a big homage to Spielberg? In real life, he came across some old Super 8 reels that Spielberg made. He called the Amblin production office and said he wanted to turn this film into Spielberg. Kathleen Kennedy meet with JJ. They talked about filmmaking and she got him a foot in the door as a teenager. She started as a production assistant herself and was quickly promoted to help run Amblin and was full on producer on major movies almost immediately. She saw similiar potential in JJ.

She trusted JJ and let him toss out the Arndt/Lucas ideas. Those may or may not have had a basic story outline for a full trilogy. When it was first reported that Disney bought Lucasfilm, the news stories mentioned that there were story treatments for 3 movies. Now some people are claiming 2 of those may have been spin-offs.

She also created a Story Group to oversee handling Star Wars as a franchise from a creative side and then empowered people to do that.

I think it is a mistake to not plan a full trilogy arc from the beginning. Is that her failing or the story group? Is it because Iger wanted the first movie out quickly and a movie every year to appease stockholders to justify spending 4 billion on Lucasfilm?

It should be noted that Kennedy produced a bunch of series where they didn't plan out a major plot across multiple movies at once (Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, Land Before Time, Back to the Future, etc) and they turned out fine. The Original Trilogy of Star Wars was made one movie at at time, and with Lucas constantly changing his mind.

Rian Johnson said he expected his first meeting at Lucasfilm after signing a contract, there would be a white board with the main plot of the trilogy mapped out and he was genuinely shocked when then told him he has a blank canvas to do ANYTHING he wanted, though obviously he had to follow TFA.

Amy Pascal gets a lot of shit for micro-managing and ruining films. Kathleen Kennedy lets creative visionaries do their thing. She provides some input, signs off with approval and finds ways to make those visions reality.

Some people suggest that Spielberg is responsible for most of her success and she offers nothing. Read behind the scenes books on the Indy trilogy. Or read behind the scenes on Back to the Future. Spielberg sometimes had some stupid idea. He wanted to Nuke the Fridge in Back to the Future before he finally did it in Indy 4. He thought it would be really funny in Indy to joke about Indy basically being a pedophile. The pieces of that are left in Raiders of Lost Ark, but not explicitly stated. Marion Ravenwood was the daughter of his peer. When Indy was first sleeping with her and then left her, she was a teenager. Spielberg and Lucas both thought that was funny. The also left in that Indy's female students all have a thing for him.

When a creative type is brainstorming, they need a voice of reason to separate the good ideas from the bad and figuring out what it takes to make those things happen. Producers determine what is going to be on a set, what is location shooting, an overall plan for the production, what is practical versus CGI, etc. They playbook the whole fucking production. For TLJ, Ram Bergman was the primary one doing that nitty gritty stuff, but that was the role Kathleen Kennedy played most of her career. Listen to Kevin Smith talk about Scott Mosier as a producer sometime and you'll realize how important producers are and what they do.

Kenndy is now more of a studio head and that is a different role with different requirements. But when people label her as some incompetent idiot, I think they overlook how she got to where she was."
5919,2021-02-18 05:41:21,km5rjt,"The producer is in charge of the director rather. She is the boss who has proven over a very lengthy career to be a good decision maker. If you listen to the various directors she was worked with over her career, they all credit her brilliance. But sure, you literally don't even know what an executive producer does, and you know better than Spielberg what role she played on his movies (for example).

The decisions people are unhappy with recently have been as she has shifted to CEO role and been more hands off. She didn't plan out the story of the sequel trilogy.

She did however personally approve the Vader hallway scene in Rogue One."
5920,2021-02-22 14:37:56,km5rjt,"No. Spielberg calls her and Frank Marshall his primary partners in all his films. He has routinely praised her for her input in his films. And there is a reason why Lucas hand picked her to take over Lucasfilm.

Production assistants are who you are thinking of."
5921,2020-12-29 04:35:40,km5rjt,"Totally agreed. The fact that they went into the trilogy without an overarching story figured out beforehand, is so fucking stupid that I still can barely believe it."
5922,2020-12-29 12:45:26,km5rjt,"Well at least for RoS, the writing is also very bad on a per film basis. Movie pulls the cheap mcguffin plot out of its ass, and a lot of ""jokes"" are smeone saying how bad the situation is, and poe repeating exact the same words in a ""funny"" tone."
5923,2020-12-29 16:58:01,km5rjt,"That's still the most unbelievable thing I've seen in movie history.

Johnson also was only obsessed with the first 30 minutes of Star Wars because it was all he could watch every morning for months before having to go to school. This is all available informatiuon published in movie trade mgazines."
5927,2020-12-29 13:09:33,km5rjt,The Rey/ Kyle story was good and developed over the three movies.  The rest of the cast were dead weight and were mismanaged.

Neither did GL for the OT."
5929,2020-12-29 18:22:50,km5rjt,"I disagree that they needed a full plan. I mean ideally yeah it would have been nice, but it isn’t necessary. I say this as someone who doesn’t hate TLJ at all and i don’t think it really contradicts TFA in a negative way. Personally i think the main fault of the trilogy lies with TROS and the direction taken with that film. 

  TFA was an entertaining movie that gave us mew and interesting characters with a plot backdrop that was all too familiar. TLJ tries to shake things up in some successful ways ( imo any scene with luke, rey, or kylo) and in bad ways( pretty much the entire b plot of the movie) however there was a clear direction TROS could have gone from the ending of TLJ and instead of building on that i think JJ and co tried to pander to fans unhappy with the current state of the films. Instead of leaving kylo to be the central big bad they throw in a palpatine return that feels shoehorned in. Instead of building of of rey trying to cement herself as her own character making her own place in the story they have her fix anakins saber and make her related to palpatine. 

   The movie just does so much to go back on any kind of narrative push that TLJ did in order to try to placate angry fans. The outcome ends up being a trilogy that feels extremely disjointed and unsatisfying as a supposed “conclusion to a story 40 years in the making”. I fully believe if JJ were more open to just building off of rian instead of trying to undo it the trilogy as a whole would be so much more well received"
5930,2021-06-05 19:34:10,km5rjt,"Tbf, Star Wars I-VI never had any concrete multi-film plan."
5931,2020-12-29 12:56:50,km5rjt,"That's not the issue at all. It's not like each movie is well-written by itself and only bad when you consider it as a trilogy. Each individual movie has very sloppy writing, and when you put it together the trilogy doesn't work either.

We would all forgive the sequel trilogy if it were three good films that just weren't planned out as a trilogy. For example, I'm not sure the original trilogy was particularly well thought out, with Luke and Leia kissing, and with the ""certain point of view"" stuff."
5932,2020-12-29 06:03:18,km5rjt,"Kennedy's problem was more Bob Iger telling her in no uncertain terms that he wanted Star Wars movies now and not later.

She was unessicarily pressed for time, which resulted in her scrambling to make TFA without a plan and relying solely her film making know how.

TFA was great to see in theaters, but the cracks of not having things planned out were already there."
5933,2020-12-29 19:09:16,km5rjt,"back to the future had good story after the first one, the second two fit together. they might not have known they'd get to do a sequel after the first bttf, it said to be continued at the end but then it took 5 years for a sequel and they didn't really show a good storyline reason why doc needed to take his gf with them to the future to save their kids.

Jurassic park and idniana jones at least didn't have plotholes like the star wars sequels."

5935,2020-12-29 15:53:51,km5rjt,"IMO attempting to cram two separate casts of similar characters into one movie series was probably the number one mistake in the sequels. There just wasn’t enough movie to go around, so various characters always ended up either stealing each other’s thunder or just being along for the ride with nothing much to do, and no single character got a really satisfying story. 

It’s kind of awful to say, but I suspect that the sequel trilogy would have been better if it hadn’t started production until after Carrie Fisher passed away and/or Harrison Ford just refused to participate."

5938,2020-12-29 20:39:37,km5rjt,"If there'd been a coherent central plotline through all three movies that shit wouldn't have found such fertile ground. The Mandalorian brought in plenty of female characters and people aren't generally moaning about them because it has a coherent plotline and those characters work well within it.

The movies did feel like they kept throwing in extra characters and side plots just to pad out the runtime."

Just cause someone makes a cool movie entirely of their own devising doesn't mean they can pull off a story in such a dense world.  You need to love that world to understand it well enough to write in it.  I just don't see the love and see people trying to change it for their own agendas.  Star Wars had a generational legacy before Kennedy and hopefully it'll still have that long after she's gone.  Same with Kutrzman/JJ trek, but boy they are both in a shitty spot right now.  If not for Rogue One and Mandalorian I'd be done with Star Wars.  Cause of STD & Picard I AM done with Trek!  It sucks cause my life was better when they were both telling good stories."

But now that the mystery has been ""revealed,"" it allows the movie to steer into new territory by swapping to a crime thriller where we're watching her attempts to get away with it. These are made even better because she's the exact opposite of the character you usually see in movies about criminals trying to get away with murder (she is shy and kind and seriously just terrible at lying or getting away with murder).!< And of course, it also has this whole anti-capitalism message which is pretty ""in"" right now."

I loved that they revealed the killer so quickly, it took you from who dunnit to will she get away with it to nope it's still a murder mystery. It definitely stands out. The characters were great, I personally thought the acting was fine. 

It will be hard for knives out 2 to recapture the magic really, as it can't do the same thing twice, but I'm all for more Daniel Craig."

5956,2020-12-29 04:57:13,km5rjt,"Did she though?  She delivered 5 movies in short succession that made a little more than $5 billion worldwide and a show that became must see tv on a fledgling streaming app.  Creative process (and carousel of directors) aside, she got Star Wars back in the public consciousness by getting new blood on avenues like Mandelorian, making it to where Favreau and Filoni could bring new live action stories pivoting away from movies at arguably the perfect time.  Through the show they can recruit new talent and hire up and coming directors to expand the story and potentially fill in blanks in the lore outside the various cartoons many mainstream audiences would otherwise overlook if they’re not children.

It may not be the Star Wars many would’ve hoped for but it could potentially be the Star Wars that will survive long after Lucas.  Also, there’s the upcoming Willow series which I do wonder are they going to use that series as a stepping stone to adapt Lucas and Clairmont’s Chronicles of Shadow War trilogy?  Only time will tell."
5957,2020-12-29 04:49:53,km5rjt,"For real. I don't get why people constantly bring up her past projects as if it means her current work is good. Yeah, she produced a lot of good movies in the '80s and '90s. Well, Joe Montana won a lot of Super Bowls in the '80s and '90s, but if he suited up and started a game this Sunday he would literally die. Past success does not indicate current success. Kennedy is doing a bad job *now* and previous projects do not excuse that."

I might be wrong about this and I don't care enough to look it up but I recall that production on TLJ started before all of the final details of the plot for TFA were nailed down.

The DCEU and Dark Universe movies all sucked because those were al rushed as well. They were all trying to quickly replicate the success of the MCU, which was a success because they took their time.

KK gets all of the hate but I think this is a case of shit rolling downhill."

5961,2020-12-29 05:25:45,km5rjt,She called out fans who didn't like the movie as sexist.  Having poor writing and then blaming the audience for not liking it is bullshit!  So I'll forever want someone else to take her position and let her make some movies in worlds she understands.  Do you really think Mando would be enjoyable without Favreau and Filloni?
5962,2020-12-29 04:12:22,km5rjt,"Between 1993-1996 she was credited as a producer for 15 films, so no, Iger deserves 0 blame for asking for one film a year. Also, do you have a source on that? I couldn’t find anything about it

Edit: ya’ll know it’s extremely common for a producer to make at least 1 film a year, right? That’s normal."
5963,2020-12-29 05:40:41,km5rjt,"It is slightly different for original properties as opposed to continuations.  I would seem a bit odd to suggest that the success of a movie is unrelated to anticipation generated from previous editions?  It isn't like The Force Awakens came out of no where, people were chomping at the bit to watch it.  And I think Disney said that part of their motivation for slowing down the release was to give people a chance to whet their appetites as well?

Surely the massive number of sequels and series being released strongly suggests that people wanting to see the continuation of a series is an important part in a series success?"
5964,2020-12-29 04:27:04,km5rjt,"Well the film ended up really bad and was a huge flop, so I think the public’s disinterest in a Solo film was something she should’ve known better about. The box office supports this. It literally flopped because no one asked for it or cared enough to see it"

5969,2020-12-29 18:43:34,km5rjt,You're thinking of Lawrence Kasdan. He agreed to work with JJ on TFA if he could write a Solo movie. Lucas really had nothing to do with Solo.
5970,2020-12-29 17:06:49,km5rjt,Yeah that sounds mostly like hindsight. People have been worshipping at the alters of Boba Fett and Han Solo for like 30 years now. I think a decent amount of people knew any one off story movie would suck but it's commercial and popular failure was primarily because of the previous movie. A movie can make a ton of money and be popular even if it fundamentally sucks. It just won't stay popular years later.
5971,2020-12-29 04:35:01,km5rjt,"Star Wars kind of has a trickle down effect where the real money is in the merchandising, which apparently was very badly affected by the reception of the new movies. Those movies will always make decent money at the box office, but if people don't like them after seeing them, they won't be buying the toys which is probably why most stores only a year after Ep IX have already stopped selling much SW stuff, even though they've been a constant mainstay on shelves since the 90s. The new movies really hurt the brand whether critics liked them or not"

Studios want to see financial growth in their franchises, and I guarantee you no one at Disney was happy that TROS grossed 1.07 billion. While that’s a number that many studios would kill to have, it’s just disastrous when you consider that it’s half of what TFA made. It shows a declining interest from the public, and shows that Star Wars is on a downward trend. 

When TLJ came out, what some people consider to be the best film in the sequel trilogy, she panicked at the decisive response and produced a film that absolutely no one liked, crammed with fan service that felt forced and out of place. 

So no, both of your statements are incorrect."

I enjoyed it a lot, and thought it was great, but the only reason it got made was becuase Laurence Kasdan only agreed to help write TFA if he got to do a Solo movie. Since KK had no time to spare in making TFA, she agreed.

The funny thing is, Solo would have been the perfect movie to premiere exclusively on Disney Plus."
5985,2020-12-29 09:15:27,km5rjt,"Not sure that really makes sense. Seems rather odd that people didn't like Last Jedi and than no one watched Solo (which bombed) and conclude from that that it was all J.J. Abrhams fault, who had nothing do with either film."
5986,2020-12-29 11:17:25,km5rjt,"I enjoyed Solo. I like Alden Ehrenreich and Donald Glover but I couldn't shake the feeling that this was a movie that didn't need to exist, we don't need to know Han Solo's back story and we know where he ends up. A Disney Plus show of Han Solo's adventures could have been fun.

It's not impossible to do prequels properly though. Look at Better Call Saul - as we head into the Sixth and final season which sets up everyone in their Breaking Bad start positions, there are so many theories about how the characters get there from where the end of season 5 leaves off and what happens to the characters who don't appear in Breaking Bad. Then again RJ, JJ and the LFL story group are nowhere near the writers that Vince Gilligan, Peter Gould and their team are. 

I disagree on TLJ. JJ's lazy writing made TFA feel like I'd seen a third of something which was an inferior retread of something I'd enjoyed much more (and ANH can also stand on its own as a movie). I thought TFA would feel better in the context of the completed trilogy. Like many, I assumed there was a plan.

If JJ lit a fire under the franchise with TFA, then RJ doused it in fuel. TLJ was an incredibly selfish movie to make for the middle of a trilogy and the penultimate episode of a 40 year saga. After that episode 9 was pretty much doomed to being dead on arrival. There was no suspense and nothing to fight for and the anorexically thin characters weren't interesting enough to follow (as most of the cast clearly knew with some more vocal than others...)"

Does she deserve criticism for not managing the IP better and planning out a whole trilogy? Sure.

She has a long running very close relationship with JJ Abrams and she gave him too much latitude when Arndt and Lucas were supposed to do a whole trilogy plan. Abrams asked to toss that out and start over. Then he asked a bunch of questions in the first movie, didn't have answers planned, created a bunch of story problems, and then actively shit all over the work Rian Johnson did with TLJ.

As the CEO of Lucasfilm, she mismanaged the brand. But the movies were still well produced, and she has one of the best producer resumes you'll find in Hollywood history.

She might be a great producer for projects where other people are the creative force.  Arguably these great directors will want the best people for their movies.  

I think where she failed is when she tried to expand her producing to the creative side.  Where she chose the directors and told them what to do.  

>when it is a female producer then suddenly producers are meaningless

No obviously we are arguing that they are important and that she is currently failing in that important role.  

>You're outright saying that everything Lucas and Spielberg said about her brilliance are lie.

First, Hollywood people are often very free with praise.

Second, I'm saying she is usually good when she has a great director.  The great director is the driving force of how the movie is made.  She is probably amazing at the technical shit a producer does and helps get it out of the way of the director who can focus on making a great film.  It is a relationship where the great director has equal or more say in how the film is made.

When she is the one in charge somehow the things that make her good with great directors make her bad with those she has influence or control over."

Favreau is the one running that show, which is why it has an actual plan, unlike the ST, which she WAS in charge of, and had no plan. 

Favreau is the one hiring the directors for the show, whereas KK was hiring them for the ST. 

And if you think that Disney would allow KK to say ""no"" to something Favreau wanted to do after Jungle Book almost made a billion, after Lion King made 1.6 billion, and he was the first director of their golden goose --the MCU, you're nuts. And to her credit, KK isn't nuts. She knows corporate culture. 

But KK has nothing to do with The Mandalorian, again, beyond saying the person running it, might also want to run it with Filoni, and giving access to LucasFilm productions to make it happen. Which yes, good on KK for both of those things. These are the kinds of things that makes her a good producer. Knowing who should talk to who, and then getting the resources to make thing happen.

If we are going off of your own opinion then there is no way I can argue with you, but I feel safe saying if you polled people here you would most likely have Sixth Sense or Unbreakable ahead.

There was the Rey mystery, the Snoke mystery, the Luke mystery and the eventual Palpatine mystery. It felt like a desperate attempt at trying to reach a similar pivotal moment in film history as the scene in The Empire Strikes Back when Darth Vader reveals to Luke he is Luke's father.

The new trilogy could have been perfectly okay straight-up adventure movies is space but the off-putting mystery box shenanigans weighted it down, at least for me. Watching the original trilogy, trying to see it as if it was the first time, there's not a single point in the first two movies where we need to find out who is Luke's father. Of course, the decision was done during the making of Empire so the first movie was already free of the package but even in the second movie before the reveal it's just a Sith Lord hunting down the last jedi and even without the reveal, I think the trilogy could have worked (obviously taking the story to different direction). My point is, it would have been a perfectly fine space adventure without the family angle, as well. Maybe not as impactful but still entertaining."

i can totally see why on paper and in pitch why the last two movies got green lit and they thought it was going to excite fans until it didn't"

The trilogy would've been vastly improved if it was purely JJ, or pure RJ - but flip-flopping between the two left us with a disjointed mess rather than a coherent trilogy."

So it worked easier to just make it up as they went along (even when some obvious clashes happened, like Luke kissing his sister or Obi Wan's ridiculous ""from a certain point of view"" line about how he apparently lied about Luke's dad).

1-3 had a fairly solid plan in that he'd already told us most of the main beats before any of those films came out and was just filling in gaps and showing us how it went down. Some clashes again (Anakin was not already a mighty Jedi when Obi Wan first met him, like he'd said), though this was minor stuff rather than anything internally jarring.

However - even in those cases it was one person making it up as they went along, so you didn't get the whiplash of two storytellers pulling in totally opposite directions and fighting to undo the other's stuff."

Lucas actually wanted to go well beyond *Episode VI* and save the showdown with the Emperor for *Episode IX,* but he realised that he wasn't guaranteed the chance to get the cast back beyond *Episode VI,* so he concluded with that movie. 

The other thing that the original trilogy has that the sequel trilogy doesn't is a single individual at its creative centre - George Lucas. He wrote all the screen stories and contributed to all the scripts, and was present for the two movies he didn't direct. The sequel trilogy has no common writer across all three movies, which is part of the reason why they don't feel cohesive."

TLJ is a terrific movie. I love how it twists the mythology of the franchise, staying true to the originals but developing in a believable and interesting way. Luke's cynical development and redemption, Rey's discovery that she is not born special and has to choose her own destiny, Kylo's ascension to true irredeemable villainy, and that DOPE SALT PLANET (why does no one talk about how cool that effect is?). Sure the first half drags on a bit long, and Finn's failed sacrifice is pretty awkward, but the good outweighs this by so much.

It really saddens me that the fanbase is so toxic that they basically forced Disney to backpedal in RoS and turn into this hot mess. Half of that movie is spent reversing the decisions made in TLJ rather than pushing the story forward as Johnson had managed to do so effectively."
6082,2020-12-29 15:01:52,km5rjt,"Liked it so much its box office takings were half the previous one, it decimated and irreparably divided the fanbase and essentially put the entire movie arm of the franchise on indefinite hold.

They made billion in spite of her, not because. They were always gonna make billions. But they would have made A LOT more if they were actually good movie. 

The thing all her other movies have in common is that they had brilliant creative forces behind them... and she wasn't one of them. Great producer? yes. She still failed at her current position though."

6089,2020-12-29 09:14:52,km5rjt,"Agreed. It’s worth noting that [Iger literally took the blame] (https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/bob-iger-disneys-streaming-service-james-gunn-star-wars-slowdown-1145493) for rushing out the films. 

However, it’s a shame that despite this statement being made in 2018, he didn’t seem to learn his lesson in time for The Rise of Skywalker a year later. [Abrams’ editor] (https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.indiewire.com/2020/01/star-wars-rise-of-skywalker-editor-rushed-production-fan-service-1202199976/amp/ ) opened up about how frantic the production was with them literally editing *on set* as scenes were being filmed. Between the change in directors and Carrie Fisher’s abrupt death, you’d think they’d give the crew more time to nail down a proper ending to not only the sequel trilogy but the saga as a whole. Alas... I try not to be too negative online because there’s so much of it circulating these days, but man TRoS ended up being one of the most frustrating theater experiences I’ve ever had. I hope they learned their lesson and give future projects the time they need to properly flesh them out."
6090,2020-12-29 05:40:16,km5rjt,"> TLJ started before all of the final details of the plot for TFA were nailed down.

Rian Johnson was hired to write and direct TLJ before the TFA rewrites. By the time he was able to start working on it, TFA was in the middle of principal photography. He saw the TFA script and was watching dailies of footage they were shooting.

He said the story for TLJ was born from watching those dailies and being super impressed by the acting performances of Dasiy Ridley and Adam Driver. The decision for Luke to be reticent was both the only real logical answer for what TFA setup, and also because once Luke comes in and becomes the big hero, it takes all the focus away from Rey. Arndt said the same thing when he was trying to write VII. Rian also killed off Snoke and wrote him out to shift the focus to Kylo.

He wanted to focus on Rey and Kylo as the center of the trilogy, and honestly I think that was a smart move.

Honestly I'm really curious what he could have come up with if he did the whole trilogy to begin with. Rian did argue for having a whole trilogy plotted out to begin with and was shocked the sequel trilogy wasn't planned out. For his Star Wars spin-offs (that is apparently still doing?) he said step one is planning out the entire trilogy and then writing the script for the first one."

Iger definitely has some blame to take and even admitted to it with the failure of Solo -

""I take the blame,"" he said. ""[It] was a little too much, too fast."" Going forward, Iger said Disney will be ""a little bit more careful about volume and timing.""

If anything Kathleen may have given the creators too much space or chose people with very different visions of SW. JJ being the nostalgia guy and RJ being the burn it all down guy.

Spielberg, Lucas and others that worked with her cite all her past successes as areas where she was a full partner on the creative team and was brilliant.

There is a great book on the behind the scenes / making of the Indiana Jones Trilogy that I highly recommend.

6153,2020-12-29 20:10:02,km5rjt,"Absolutely these are subjective opinions.

People didn't expect Sixth Sense or see it coming, so it got more critical praise. When people were expecting greatness and twists from him, it altered how his later films were viewed.

I have a lesser view of Unbreakable than most. I feel like it was different from what was advertised and not much of anything happens during the run time of the movie. It doesn't build tension particularly well. The protagonist is pretty boring and uninteresting. Samuel Jackson's Mr. Glass was very interesting. I think the film gets overrated by people who love super hero stories and were desperate for validation that it could be done well in a serious manner. 

We can look back and ask if Donner's Superman or the graphic novel of Watchmen might even be overrated because they validated super hero / comic book stories done in a serious light, but aren't necessarily as genius as people would have you believe. Watchmen is VERY GOOD, meta and does a lot of things well in world building with the news articles, and such. It is also slow, a bit boring and has a particularly stupid ending. The film ending is more thematically appropriate that is Dr. Manhattan is a metaphor for a Super Power Nation (like the US) basically being terrifying and godlike to the rest of the world. The story is a overlaid with the Cold War and explores godlike super heroes as those metaphors for super power nations, and who watches them to make sure they aren't corrupt or causing harm along the way?

The nuclear blasts being attributed to Dr. Manhattan actually make far more sense as an ending to that story.

Heck, we can look back now on Singer's first X-Men film, or Raimi's first Spider-Man film. Both were far from perfect and exceptionally well received in their time. Looking back are they overrated and others did superhero films considerably better since then?

The counter-point might be that someone had to innovate and create the formula. They had to walk so others could later run. I think Unbreakable is pretty overrated, but maybe it did help later films and deserves credit for innovation. 

I maintain that Signs is the best made film he put out the reasons I stated. I get that others seem to prefer The Sixth Sense or Unbreakable, but I don't think they're quite as well made as Signs."

6157,2020-12-30 14:42:00,km5rjt,"Yeah man I totally agree. The core of what makes Star Wars fun is ""space fantasy"". Adventures in space with magic and laser swords. The fun of those twists in the OT is that we had no idea they were coming. But for some reason the creative team behind this sequel trilogy thinks the core of Star Wars is ""Skywalkers and Plot Twists"". And now from the first movie they're teasing the audience and priming them for these twists. And to make it even worse, **they didn't even do that well, because they didn't even know what those twists were going to be. They just created an aura of mystery around a bunch of characters/plot points and said ""we'll figure this out later"".** They approached it from the totally wrong angle IMO.

I think if they made this new trilogy using Finn's character as an entry-point into the ""post-OT"" world and focused on making it the best story possible over the course of the three movies it would have been amazing and could've been on par with the OT. The character of Finn and the core concept of his character - of a defected Stormtrooper who learns to fight for good, not because he's a 'chosen one', but because it's the right thing - is by far the strongest creative concept in the new trilogy. And they ended up throwing that in the garbage.

But they had all this creative baggage about what they think Star Wars is or what audiences expect out of Star Wars, on top of all this external pressure, and they fucked it all up."

Writing is really hard and sticking to some arbitrary plot points is a hard constraint. Because sometimes those points don’t push characters to undergo the arc they need to go through. 

I think TFA and TLJ flowed well enough. I think the biggest problem was TROS not continuing what was set at that point in time.

TFA is incredibly safe, and was mostly well-received but had plenty of people asking for something new. So, they give Rian free reign, and he goes hard for it. However, now the loudest voices are saying ""Actually we don't like that, don't do that, go back to the Star Wars we know and love."" So, JJ (who also seems to not have the most writing talent) is now being weighed down by whatever he wants to do plus the demands of Disney. Add to all of that the absurd release schedule, and it's not a surprise TROS was the mess that it was.

People like to compare the MCU favorably to Star Wars, but the MCU's greatest strength was that it got its core creative team in place before it was the biggest film franchise in the world.

well that goes against both Daisy Ridley and JJ Abrahms claiming that there was a plan and Rian took it a different direction.

>But without getting in the weeds on episode eight, that was a story that Rian wrote and was telling based on seven before we met. So he was taking the thing in another direction.

> J. J. wrote Episode VII, as well as drafts for VIII & IX. Then Rian Johnson arrived and wrote TLJ entirely. I believe there was some sort of general consensus on the main lines of the trilogy, but apart from that, every director writes and realizes his film in his own way. Rian Johnson and J. J. Abrams met to discuss all of this, although Episode VIII is still his very own work. I believe Rian didn’t keep anything from the first draft of Episode VIII."""
6201,2020-12-29 16:21:17,km5rjt,"> The decision for Luke to be reticent was both the only real logical answer for what TFA setup

No, it wasn't. RJ asked JJ to remove rocks floating around Luke when Rey arrived in TFA. So Luke did not abandon the force originally. A different story was in mind.

He very well could have traveled to the first jedi temple to develop a deeper understanding and stronger connection to the force, following Kylo's fall. It's actually a weird place to hide if you're quitting the jedi order."

Star Wars also has lots of source material, but for some reason Lucasfilm decided to almost completely ignore it in the making of the new trilogy (at least until wildly stabbing at the third film, at which point it was too late)."
6230,2020-12-30 02:38:48,km5rjt,"It's not fair to compare the original trilogy to the sequel trilogy when it comes to the lack of planning for two reasons.

The first is that, as established, George Lucas didn't plan for a trilogy when he first made *Star Wars.* He may have had ideas for more movies, but he knew that he wasn't guaranteed more, so he made sure that the one movie he was making 'worked' as a standalone movie and developed a heap of backstory and unused story ideas that could be put to use in potential sequels. With the sequel trilogy, it was known from day one that there would be a trilogy.

The second reason the comparison doesn't work is because George Lucas was the original trilogy's creative centre. Even without a plan, he wrote all the screen stories and had a hand in all the scripts, so there was a creative consistency to the trilogy even though it wasn't planned out and had different directors each time. The sequel trilogy not only had different directors, but different *writers,* so it doesn't feel cohesive as a trilogy."

>the new movies are also going movie by movie which is why they are disjointed

But the argument here is that they shouldn't have done that. Isn't the whole point of a sequel to he better than what came before it? At least a single story treatment for all three movies by one writer/team of writers would have made a huge difference."

Calling her as an all time great producer is true if you’re talking budgets and ability to have a working relationship with directors.

Great directors often need someone to say ""no, that is a stupid idea.""  Lucas would have really benefited from a few people like that when making the prequels.

She might be really good at spotting a bad idea and talking them out of it.  

But she also might be terrible at recognizing what makes a great film.  A forest and the trees situation.

>Spielberg, Lucas and others that worked with her cite all her past successes as areas where she was a full partner on the creative team and was brilliant.

That is my point.  Partner vs boss.  In movies where she is a partner she seems to be great.

In movies where she is the boss her weaknesses overtake her skills."

people aren't looking at the finished piece. they're seeing exciting concept art, lines that sound interesting, big name actors appearing, and a writer/director who is good at spinning a sales pitch. movie companies mitigate by hiring big star names or making movies (like star wars) that have a brand they know will get people into the cinema no matter what. they will throw money at that risk more than a new concept movie by a new director even if the script is amazing

Not true! We knew about Anakin's volcanic duel with Obi Wan, we knew there was a Jedi-backed Republic that was overtaken by the Empire, we knew there were the Clone Wars that Obi Wan fought in, etc. We had a lot of the major beats in place before the films were made (I remember reading them in source books and such!), even discounting the prequel novels that were largely ignored.

>When did he say that?

So Obi Wan's line in Episode 4 is: ""When I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. But I was amazed how strongly the Force was with him. I took it upon myself to train him as a Jedi."" So my bad, got some bits mixed up there. But I'm not sure I'd call ""great pod racer"" the same as ""great pilot"" necessarily. The rest of the fudging (he wasn't really super keen on taking Anakin as an apprentice until Qui Gon died) is believable enough.

>5 had to follow 4 and 6 had to follow 5 and 4.

Yeah, just a single series of sequels with no supporting material or anything else, and much lower expectations.

6262,2020-12-29 15:03:31,km5rjt,"I'm pretty sure TLJ is what killed the trilogy. It ended a lot of plot lines from TFA with almost no fanfare or satisfaction to their resolution, effectively throwing some of them in the trash, eliminated characters that could have been interesting to use, left no replacements for them, and effectively ended the movie with only one thing left to do to resolve the entire plotline.  

It's why RoS had to just pull a bunch of shit out of thin air. Because Johnson didn't leave much of anything to really work with."
6263,2020-12-29 10:08:01,km5rjt,"TFA and TLJ flow incredibly well, the problem is that it leaves the last movie to be the ""climactic ending battle"" between Rey's side and Kylo's side... and it's clear the people making TROS wanted more.

Namely, they probably wanted the sort of ""standard SW adventure"" that TLJ completely skirted. Notice how a big portion of TROS is just random quests in random planets to get mcguffins, all so that we can have the core group all together flying the millenium falcon and having fun. This is all in service of ""the brand"", Kennedy and Abrams probably had a vision that Rey and Finn and Poe would become the new memorable characters for a whole new generation of fans.

Rian Johnson probably imagined that the last act in the trilogy would simply assume there was no more story to tell, no further character development to be made, no redemption arc, just the final battle. That would be doable, but it doesn't leave much room for brand-building.

Here's the thing: even with TFA and TLJ as the first two steps, they could have totally made it work AND made the fun SW adventures with the crew they wanted to make, if upon seeing TLJ's reaction they had decided to expand the story from a trilogy into 5 or so movies instead. Think about it, as the middle chapter in a trilogy TLJ doesn't get much done, but as the second step in a series it actually manages to finalize establishing everyone. Rey is fully committed to her cause, Kylo has no more doubts about being the villain, Finn is totally on board with the fight, and almost all of the torches have been passed. Turn The Rise of Skywalker into 3 separate movies and it could very well have worked out better. Third movie fun with the crew, rebuilding the Resistance to be formidable, while Kylo is off somewhere else doing his own bit of ""becoming the supreme leader"". Fourth movie you start to build up the ending, fifth movie is the climax. Done and done."
6264,2020-12-29 19:12:19,km5rjt,"What would actually be wrong with that?  The OT heroes were what people were there to see.

They should have started with the OT characters and, over the course of the trilogy, gradually passed the torch to a new generation.

Instead they turned the OT characters people loved into a bunch of assholes who failed at everything so that the new characters can show up and do everything better.  But rather than making people love the new characters it just created resentment for them."

Not to mention he didn't even really do anything that different. We got an AT-AT vs rebels slowdown on a salt planet, like the Empire Strikes back except that was on a snow planet. We got a Jedi taken by the number 2 baddie to the throne room of the big bad, just like Return of the Jedi.

The PT is a man putting his idea, his story, his imagination out there, even if his delivery is poor. The ST is just a room full of middle aged dudes trying to come up with a way to fill up each movie. The PT was at least born out of a story, and that shows.

6287,2020-12-29 06:10:05,km5rjt,"Lucas was heavily inspired by Kurosawa and Rian Johnson wanted to pay tribute to that. Kurasawa had a film called Rashoman. A story is told from three different perspectives and the audience is left to determine the truth. With TLJ we see a story of Luke going to talk to Ben told three different ways. A lot of the anger in regards to the film are people assuming that what Ben/Kylo said was the absolute truth, that Luke just randomly went to go murder his nephew.

Luke just went in to have a talk. He was overcome with a vision of the Force that was absolutely terrifying. Perhaps he legitimately saw the BILLIONS of death Kylo would be responsible for, as well as the destruction of the Jedi temple. Luke then gained control of himself and decided not to attack.

People saw it is massively out of character for Luke to light his saber even if briefly out of fear or anger.

In the OT, Luke uses the dark side to Force choke Gamorrean guards in Jabba's Palace.. He attacks Vader in anger, beats him down and chops his hand off before catching himself. And we see Obi-Wan in the PT light his saber in fear when Anakin drops next to him in the elevator.

TFA established that Luke and Kylo had a falling out at the Jedi Academy, that the First Order is a massive threat to the galaxy, that Leia has this tiny rag-tag group trying to stand up to The First Order, that Luke knows Kylo is a threat and Luke ran away, hid and gave Leia no way to find him. On top of that, Luke didn't even come running when Kylo blew up three planets or murdered Han. Luke just still stayed on his island. TFA is responsible for all of that, but fans have spent years shitting on Rian for ruining Luke.

How was Rian supposed to respond to that? Luke cutting himself off from the Force was really the only way to make the actions of TFA make sense."

I don't think Rian is lying when he said there was no trilogy plan. Daisy's statements that JJ privately having a few ideas about long term stories don't contradict that.

JJ also told his lifelong best friend that he thought the script for TLJ was brilliant and he was jealous he wasn't making movie. 

https://screenrant.com/star-wars-8-script-abrams-johnson/

JJ never once said he wrote drafts for VIII and IX. That is an outright lie. He and Lawrence Kasdan spoke about how it was a struggle to finish the script for TFA.

>It’s only after the film’s release that Hamill was able to tell Chinese press what that big wrong thing would’ve been. At one point, Luke Skywalker would’ve been surrounded by floating boulders as Rey looked on, lightsaber outstretched. It would’ve been a cool visual, and it makes sense, given that Luke is a super-powerful Jedi master.

>Except — wait! One of the biggest twists in The Last Jedi is the revelation that Luke has cut himself off from the Force in the wake of his failure with Ben Solo. Those floating rocks would’ve undermined his character arc in Last Jedi, so they had to go.

>“When I read [The Last Jedi] before [The Force Awakens] came out, I said ‘what?!” and called JJ [Abrams] or Rian [Johnson] to say, ‘Are you guys aware of this? Have you seen a cut? Is there floating boulders?’” Hamill recalled. “And they said, ‘No, we caught that and we worked it all out.’”

6290,2020-12-29 18:56:53,km5rjt,">  RJ asked JJ to remove rocks floating around Luke when Rey arrived in TFA. So Luke did not abandon the force originally

First off, I don't believe that common rumor. JJ And Rian both repeatedly said that Rian asked for one change, and one change alone to the end of VII. Rian asked to swap where R2-D2 and BB-8 were going.

Likewise Colin Trevorrow asked Rian to make one small tweak to the end of TLJ. He asked that Rey and Poe have a proper meeting at the end of TLJ. This suddenly makes sense when you read his script for IX when Rey and Poe suddenly develop a romance.

I'm not implying that JJ had decided in TFA that Luke abandoned the Force. JJ spent his entire career obsessed with a Mystery Box. He says it is better to not have answers. His grandfather gave him a literal mystery box as a kid that he has never opened and he doesn't want to open. He did a full issue of Wired as a Guest Editor discussing the Mystery Box concept that he is obsessed with. As a filmmaker, he likes to ask questions and not answer them. This has been his whole career and he openly talks about it.

JJ didn't have official answers for the mysteries he created in TFA.

However, I'm saying Rian's decision to have Luke cut off from the Force was the only logical explanation for what JJ handed him."

As for IW that makes sense cause the movies are separated by only 2 years,these things run in parallel.

>Pretty much nobody wants that

I'm not defending the sequels here. My point is that having a ',plan is not a requirement and many series have been made without a solid plan,Feigr is somewhat an exception. The sequels could've been good without a plan if they did many things differently. The myth of a ""plan"" has been regularily debunked by anyone working on film and TV,even Feige didnt really have a plan on how to get to IW when Thanos showed up at the end of Avengers pr even a plan for Avenvers when Nick Fury shows up in IM1. There are aims or hooks or a idea on how to proceed but things generally materialize on a film to film basis.

I'm sure Feige has plans and some ideas for X-Men but you couldn't get a solid story if you asked him today all of a sudden.

The reason Feige is an exception is having the clmicbooks to base your central vision on,its already written and mapped out in some sense.Thats not a luxury other film series have."

Some people are putting on the blame on her without crediting any of the success."
6310,2020-12-29 20:01:34,km5rjt,"> In movies where she is the boss her weaknesses overtake her skills.

That may be where she doesn't have the skills to be a studio chief, which is different from being a partner on a film.

However, during her tenure as boss at Lucasfilm she gave us the problematic sequel trilogy, but she also gave us Rogue One, Solo, Clone Wars Season 7, Rebels and The Mandalorian. All of those are pretty well loved.

As boss I think her failing with the Sequel Trilogy may have been being too hands off. She hired a Story Group to oversee long term plots and maintain canon. The Story Group didn't develop a trilogy idea, nor try to keep the three films more consistent with each other.

Even as much as I love The Mandalorian, it creates some story inconsistencies and problems. Now Filoni is suggesting the timeline may be different that what we think and there may be some ret-conning happening in places.

I've been pretty disappointed with the Story Group and how they've dropped the ball in a lot of places with Star Wars since their inception.

For example, there is an episode of Rebels where they talk about how single starfighter is super powerful and how it can take out a capital ship by itself, so it is this amazing blockade runner. The Ghost crew acquire and it get it to the Rebellion. That ship is a b-wing. They know have it before Rogue One and A New Hope, but don't use it there. Nor do they use it or have it in Empire Strikes Back. The B-Wing doesn't pop up until Return of the Jedi, and it is just a normal fighter. It isn't magical, special and doesn't take out capital ships by itself. 

Likewise, in TFA we see the Falcon exit Hyperspace manually at the last second, within the atmosphere and fully within the gravity well of Starkiller Station. The motion that Han can manually time faster the light travel like that is fucking absurd. But this means that old canon is wrong, and in new canon a ship is not forcibly removed from hyperspace just for being within the proximity of a gravity well. Except then Rebels came right after that and re-introduced Interdictor Ships that said they pull ships out of hyperspace and there is no way to bypass that or get around it. Ships are forced out of hyperspace with the presence of any gravity well and there is nothing you can do about it.

For all the praise Filoni gets, he creates a lot of problems like these in his shows. And the Story Group is signing off on all of this."

And the fact that she has had similiar success with other directors tell us something.

And the fact that Lucas hand-picked her and said ""this is the person I trust to hand my legacy to so I can retire"" says something.

Lucas is a control freak. I got to tour Skywalker Ranch. I don't casually toss that out to name drop or brag. My wife was Charity Liason for Rebel Legion. She organized hospital visits, private screenings of films for terminal patients, charity events, etc. She worked with Lucasfilm. We had a trip out to San Francisco for work and she asked Lucasfilm if maybe we could visit either the Lucasfilm offices (far more common and easier to swing) and/or Skywalker Ranch. No one gets to tour Skywalker Ranch. CBS had recently asked to briefly film just the outside gate for Big Bang Theory and he said no. He is very private and doesn't want many people there. Select/trusted people in his circle there however get to make extended stays and temporarily live there in a guest house. Favs apparently frequently stays in the guest house there while finishing up his films with Skywalker Sound. My wife's contact at Lucasfilm was particularly impressed with the work my wife did. She went directly to George Lucas' personal assistant and said ""you need to get these guys a tour and make them the exception"".

Skywalker Ranch is gorgeous and master planned. It doesn't have tons of artwork and props from the movies like the Lucasfilm offices do, though it does have some. In touring the place I learned exactly how much of a perfectionist he is. He individually approved pieces of lumber in the construction and demanded that each piece be perfect with no knots. The main building has an elevator that doesn't look like a metal elevator. It is all oak and particularly exquisite. There was a special story about how and why that oak was rare and special, but I don't recall. The library was exceptionally gorgeous. Every tiny detail in all of the buildings came directly from Lucas, and he built the place back in 1978.

When Lucas made the prequels, they were technically independent films. He didn't want any studio execs giving him criticism or telling him want to do. He wanted to make the films as an auteur, doing everything exactly how he wanted it. For him to hand over complete control of his entire legacy and everything he created, that is a huge thing for him.

Kathleen Kennedy was his first and only choice. This is the one person he respected enough to hand over total control to.

If that doesn't tell you something, I don't know what will.

6319,2020-12-30 02:12:45,km5rjt,"I think the root cause of the sequel trilogy's woes is Disney wanting movies out fast to make back that $4b in cash and Disney shares it had paid George Lucas. From there, Lucasfilm got rushed into making a trilogy with no plan (Disney and Lucasfilm decided to abandon the one Lucas drafted) and making movies with two-year gaps instead of the three-year gaps Lucas had between his movies. This in turn probably led to the creative relay race Lucasfilm ended up having, where a creative team makes a movie and hands control over to another team for the sequel. That's probably great for turnaround time, not so great for maintaining a cohesive feel between movies, especially without a plan.

What I've noticed is that George Lucas took his time developing *Star Wars.* He started writing the original movie in January 1973 and finished in March 1976, and this was for *one* movie - even though he may have had designs for other movies, he made sure the one movie he was writing worked as a standalone story first. For the prequels, he started writing in November 1994, and *The Phantom Menace* didn't start filming until June 1997. Lucas would write the scripts for the other prequels one at a time, but he would have known how the prequels' story would have to end even if he didn't have an overarching plan. It helps that he had a heap of backstory and unused story ideas to help develop the prequels, too.

Contrast this with the sequel trilogy, where Disney announced the sequel trilogy in October 2012. Michael Arndt was hired in November 2012 to write the script for *Episode VII,* but after eight months, he said he needed *eighteen more* to finish the script, which Disney and Lucasfilm weren't willing to give him, so he left in October 2013. J.J. Abrams and Lawrence Kasdan then came in and finished the script by April 2014, when a table read of the script was done before filming started in May. There is no evidence of a plan for the whole trilogy, and even if there was, it was abandoned in favour of the aforementioned creative relay race - Daisy Ridley suspected that Abrams had written drafts for *Episode VIII* and *Episode IX,* but Rian Johnson was given free rein to write what he wanted."

It's not an ""argument"". TFA was the same, safe movie. What the hell was Rian Johnson supposed to do? He actually tried to focus the series on Rey and Kylo, which the whole trilogy was never about. When he did that, the next movie comes back and was like, ""Hey, you everything still ties back to the Skywalkers, nothing's different...""

>Star Wars fans don't hate TLJ because it's different, we hate it because Rian Johnson clearly didn't understand Star Wars.

I disagree. Fans, who didn't even create Star Wars, get Star Wars better? Smh...of course they do. That's how fans think because they know best. I'm sure you can direct one better, which will turn out like TRoS. Pure fan service because that's what fans love.

>He broke space combat with the Holdo Manuever, he broke Luke and turned him into someone else (the guy who believed in the good in DARTH FUCKING VADER tried to kill his nephew while he slept because he had a bad dream), he broke The Force with his ridiculous Force skyping and Force projection that also somehow allows you to transfer objects, not to mention Force Ghosts can now somehow summon lightning and interact with objects, Leia Poppins, etc.

He didn't go into the room wanting to kill Ben, you are aware of that. Also, the dude was at the point go killing Vader...but what he did in TLJ is now ""too much out of character""? Smh. Also, the Force has always been broken anyways. You can't break something that's always been broken. Also, space fights or whatever in the movies never make sense anyways.

>Not to mention he didn't even really do anything that different. We got an AT-AT vs rebels slowdown on a salt planet, like the Empire Strikes back except that was on a snow planet. We got a Jedi taken by the number 2 baddie to the throne room of the big bad, just like Return of the Jedi. We had one of the good guys training with an older Jedi while the other main characters from the previous movie go on a side quest, again like Empire.

Just like every other Star Wars movie. If he didn't do anything different then people wouldn't call it the worse in the series. He actually did something different by making the movies about someone other that the Skywalkers, which TRoS reverted back because that's what fans wanted.

Again, each movie in the trilogy is different from each one and that's the problem. Many people feel that the TLJ should have been the finale...and I can agree with that...but it's weird how people blame Rian when TFA left him literally nowhere to go with characters because the TFA was just pure nostalgia. TFA is probably the safest movie of the bunch. It works because of nostalgia. The whole series should have been about Rey and Kylo...but fans didn't want that. The series is pretty much doomed because fans don't want anything different, from a creative standpoint."

6344,2020-12-30 14:49:36,km5rjt,"> He broke space combat with the Holdo Manuever

Space combat in star wars never had a lot of internal consistency exept for ""we want WWII-movie like dogfighting in space"". Apparently its possible to scale up laser weapons to the point they can make planets blow up, but mid and large scale ships are only equipped with lasers to plink smaller ships. Apparently a light freighter is just as nimble as fighters, but nobody ever thought of making a fighter with turrets in the same size. Apparently bombs and extremely nimble torpedos exist, but nobody ever thought about using them in dogfights or equipping large ships with them. Or, you know, using them as planet killers instead of building silly lasers. 

It only gets worse in the PT or legends. 

But nobody cares, because we get cool space dogfights. And the holdo maneuver was pretty damn cool in the moment. 

> he broke Luke and turned him into someone else (the guy who believed in the good in DARTH FUCKING VADER tried to kill his nephew while he slept because he had a bad dream),

Luke was established as an impulsive person that likes to face problems head-on and in the moment. It is even implied that these attributes make him susceptible to dark side influence. The PT beats us over the head with the fact by giving us a Luke-clone, but letting him fall to the dark side. 

Of course, in the end Luke realises his anger and fear wont solve the problems and his kindness prevails. Even Vader/Anakin comes back to the light side in the end. 

I also assume that with the years Luke would mellow out a bit, but all that doesnt change that its completely in Lukes character to draw his sword when faced with a sudden and almost overwhelming onslaught of negative feelings and dark side influence. 

The choice what he does next is the important part. Does he go through with his initial reaction and kill his nephew, giving in to his fear ? Does he realise that he is simply driven by fear and let his kindness prevail, just as he did all these years ago when facing Vader and the Emperor ? 

Actually killing Ben would indeed have been a stark deviation from the path he was on thus far. But he never actually gets to make this choice because Ben wakes up and attacks him. 

And Luke is distraught after his actions, not only in the immediate aftermath, but even years later. Not just because of his failure that his first student turned to the dark side, but also because he (ironically) fears that his fears and angers are still too strong. 

> he broke The Force with his ridiculous Force skyping and Force projection that also somehow allows you to transfer objects, not to mention Force Ghosts can now somehow summon lightning and interact with objects, Leia Poppins, etc.

Star wars was always a bit handwavy in what exactly force users can and can not do. TLJ introduces some new things, but all of them are both thematically and power wise in line with what was seen in previous installments. 

Force projection is new, but thematically fits very well with light side powers. We already know that the force allows telepathic communication over large distances (this was shown even in the OT) and we also know that force ghost exist. Projection basically just combines these two concepts (and a living jedi). The fact that it is extremely taxing and eventually kills Luke would explain why it wasnt really known in the mainline-Jedi order. 

Force ghosts actually interacting with the world is new too. But Yoda doesnt actually shoot force lightning, he summons natural lightning. He also does this in a place of great power, near Luke. This is thematically fitting for powers that ghosts, and also explains why force ghost dont go around shooting up their former enemies. 

It was already established that Leia is force sensitive, having her learn some basic telekinesis isnt really out of the ordinary. 

If you look at TLJ as a continuation of the OT it all feels perfectly natural. If you include the PT and Clone Wars it gets a bit odd that nobody has ever mentioned this stuff before, but its still less weird than half the stuff legends used to have. And RotS already established that the then-current understanding of the force is not all-encompassing, that in the past powerful force users had different and additional abilities. In this context adding some force powers is far from ""breaking"" the force. Its certainly much less troublesome than midichlorians. 

>Not to mention he didn't even really do anything that different.

Star Wars, at its core is about the characters. The OT is basically a classical heroes journey and Lucas stole from a lot of other works, from Hidden Fortress over Dambusters to Flash Gordon.

While TLJ does borrow a lot of indivdual points from ESB and RotJ, it does manage to do some interesting stuff with its characters and their character archs. The plot points that TLJ borrows are not forced either, you generally dont feel that they happen because of nostalgia or because they wanted to copy the older movies, but because the scenes work in the context of the movie. 

That is imho the main problem with TFA and RoS. They focus too much on plot points because they want to recreate ""Star Wars"", but dont really care if the plot points actually work or invest in character arcs. It still kind of works in TFA because the ideas behind the new characters is still pretty cool and while the suspension of disbelieve is strained (Stoke and Starkiller Base just induce eye-rolling in my), it is not completely broken down. RoS then completely falls flat on all fronts. 

TLJ on the other hand actually develops its characters and makes me more interested in the world. 

I also think that TLJ gives the next film a lot to work with. While two main plots were finished (Stoke and Luke), the character archs of the ST characters is still in full swing. Especially the Rey-Kylo arch should have been the core of the next movie, you can always invent a new McGuffin to faciliate it.

TLJ had problems completely unrelated to the wider sequal-story-arc (the joke with Huk, the pacing in the casino scene), but none of the things that its commonly critizied for are big issues."

With the exception of Episode I (in my opinion), the prequels don't really have a single standout scene for acting or writing. It's pretty much all terrible.

The one leg up I think the prequels have over the sequels is that it has a consistent (jumbled) theme and message. And there are a lot of great ideas in there, but they all just get lost in the bad scripts and acting. The expanded universe, and now new canon, made them MUCH more palatable because they expand on and give depth to a lot of the scenes from the prequels."
6351,2020-12-29 09:35:57,km5rjt,"This is less likely because either you watch Prequels and the OrigTrig beforehand and so Sequels aren't your first Star Wars or you don't, in which case large chunks of the plot make even less sense and every attempt at nostalgia bait falls absolutely flat."

Part of what people hate RotJ for (and deservingly I may add) the prequels did first.

BUT there is a really great 'core' story about the Jedi hubris causing their fall to the dark side and creating their own destruction.  Which sets in extremely well to the OT series and contrasting it... their messages and themes.  

And that just makes me more mad.  They desperately need to be remade because they are brimming with unrealized potential.

This is not an even remotely relevant counterpoint. It follows the trend of similar box office counterparts in its industry. I quite literally study this, and I’m here to tell you, despite what you may have been reading in blog posts and Twitter threads, TLJ was not a box office failure. It performed as expected given the trends of the previous decade, and did even better when it hit digital.

> Rogue Squadron, Taikas film... and.... which others? You're delusional if you think Rian Johnsons trilogy is still going to happen, lol.

Until Johnson’s trilogy is taken out of production, which it hasn’t, it’s still being developed, there is no reason outside conjecture to think it won’t be happening. Unless you have a reliable source saying it has been cancelled or is nearing cancellation, I can chalk this up to “it’s not happening because I don’t want it to”.

Feige is developing a Star Wars movie with KATHLEEN Kennedy. It’s, as they’ve stated, “a ways off”, but it’s still a film in production. Meaning six. If it were three films in production immediately following the end of the trilogy, it would still be unprecedented for Star Wars.

And in a conversation regarding how TLJ was a massive failure that crippled Star Wars’ profitability, ignoring the eight or so tv shows they have planned is disingenuous.

Now if you write it where Luke doesn't know Snoke exists, if he thinks he just screwed up so badly that his nephew went darkside and died killing every other Jedi student? That's a scenario where Luke Skywalker believably exiles himself, cuts himself off from the force, and spends a decade getting surly and deciding the Jedi need to end at any cost."

That couldn't be more inverted from Luke's arc in the OT.  Where Luke risked his own life, that of his friends and the entire galaxy because he *thought* he saw some good still in his father, an evil Sith lord who had killed untold millions and as terrorizing a galaxy.

6410,2020-12-29 19:17:10,km5rjt,">  Ray was a Mary Sue with the powers of Jesus.

Her name is Rey, first off. And she isn't a Mary Sue. People literally don't even know what that term means. A Mary Sue is a character in FAN FICTION where the author inserts themselves into an existing IP and their our representation in that universe is better than everyone else. Rey isn't fan fiction. She isn't the author inserting themselves in a story. And she isn't better than everyone else.

Anakin is a slave child owned by a junk trader with no formal education. However as a 9 year old:

* He knows how to build and program a protocol droid from scratch.
* He build a pod-racer from scratch.
* He is literally the only human pod racer in the galaxy (because it requires reactions that humans are incapable of).
* Not only that, but he is EXCEPTIONALLY better than the best podracer. In a three lap race, he starts with a handicap of being half of a lap back due to cheating and is so much better than the best podracers, he can overcome the cheating and still win.
* He is the best pilot in the galaxy
* He is the most powerful Force user in the galaxy
* He is the best with a lightsaber in the galaxy.
* Literally has no weaknesses.

Let's look at Rey.

* She doesn't know about anything off of Jakku really and is exceptionally naïve. She didn't realize what other planets looked like and was blown away by seeing plant foliage. She doesn't just know everything magically the way Anakin did as a kid even though he had no access to education.
* She flew the Falcon literally into the ground. Her impossible flying maneuver that people are upset about was a plain vertical loop and people say it is ridiculous that a grown adult could pull that off and that makes her over-powered and too perfect.
* Han points out that she doesn't know how to fire a blaster.
* Her first encounter with Kylo, he overpowers her in the Force and makes her faint.
* They have a lightsaber duel and he is clearly beating her. He then stops fighting her and attempts to turn her to the Dark Side. After he stopped fighting, she channels the Force, surprises me and gets the upper hand momentarily, but then they're split up and we don't see what will happen next.
* In TLJ Luke demonstrates that she doesn't know anything about the Force really and mocks her by physically tickling her and making her think that is the Force.
* In TRoS, Kylo defeats her in a lightsaber battle. She is exhausted, beaten and on the ground as Kylo stand above her victorious. He gets distracted by Leia's death and she stabs him. But when both fighting, he once again defeated her. He was better with a lightsaber and arguably more powerful in the Force.

Are you specifically upset that Rey used Force healing but not Grogu? What about when Stass Allie used Force Healing in Clone Wars? Or when Anakin used it in Clone Wars? Or Barriss Offee? Or Ben Solo?

If you literally only object to a woman being powerful, then what does that say?"

Did he just never hear about the edgy Darth Vader wannabe taking over the galaxy?), but I think it's a neat explanation. Luke still gets to be flawed, but also didn't spend a decade sulking instead of fixing his mistake."
6416,2020-12-29 19:32:01,km5rjt,"> Luke doesn't think Kylo survived destroying the temple and doesn't know Snoke exists.

TFA establishes that Leia and Han knew Snoke was corrupting Ben at the Temple. Super powerful Luke can't sense Ben/Kylo or Snoke at the Temple when it gets attacked? Luke thinks Ben died when he didn't?

You're saying Luke is still connected to the Force, feels three fucking planets up at once, feels Han getting murdered, and still decides to just sit on the island, but that all makes sense?

He was just waiting for Rey to show up, hand him the saber and NOW he will be ""let's go kick ass, but I wasn't going to react to three planets blowing up unless you showed up?""

You think that makes sense?"
6417,2020-12-29 18:25:49,km5rjt,"> That couldn't be more inverted from Luke's arc in the OT.

It is not massively out of character. We see examples of this in the OT with Luke.

Again, In the OT we see a vision in the Dagobah cave of Luke becoming the new Vader. We see him Luke switch to wearing all Black, and him using the Dark Side to Force Choke two Gammorean guards. He attacks in anger, beats Vader down and chops his hand off.

George Lucas was coming off a messy and painful divorce and was more interested in darker stories (we see this in Temple of Doom). He seriously considered having Luke join the Emperor and having all the other good guys die and lose out. Lucas had to be talked out of the idea, but Lucas saw Luke right on the precipice of falling to the Dark Side. The OT is about Luke realizing that same potential that led to Anakin becoming Vader existed in him. But he stopped himself and decided he wasn't going to give into the Dark Side.

Before TFA came out, I saw a bunch of fans speculating that we never see Luke in the trailer, the poster or any of the advertising. There was some secret with Luke and some speculated that Luke had gone to the Dark Side and that Luke was secretly Kylo Ren. Everyone seemed fine with Luke just being evil, if it meant he was a bad-ass.

I don't think the real objection with TLJ was that Luke had a literally momentary flash of fear to ignite his saber, the concern was that they wanted Luke to be a bad-ass and they didn't really care about the story. They were upset that they felt Luke had been neutered.

We're literally seeing this confirmed with the emotional reactions to The Mandalorian of fans saying this was all they wanted. They wanted a fully realized bad-ass Luke on screen kicking ass. They're citing the disappointment that TLJ didn't deliver it and how amazing it is that The Mandalorian did.

The problem is that Michael Arndt was trying to write his version of Episode VII and he said the moment Luke entered the script and kicked ass, he was worried it took the film away from Rey and the intent was for Rey to be the center of a new trilogy.

There is a solution to that problem and the solution is that you then need to kill Luke off so that Rey has to stand on her own and no longer has the powerful mentor to protect her. We see this in countless versions of the Hero's Journey. We get to see a bad-ass mentor, but the mentor has to die so the new protagonist is in danger and has to stand up on their own.

They could have had a bad-ass Luke in VII and then Luke takes out Snoke in some heroic sacrifice perhaps in VIII, leaving Rey and Kylo alone for IX.

The problem is that JJ kicked that can down the road, didn't even really have Luke in his movie and established that Luke was a coward who hid the entire time with no means of anyone contacting him, knowing full well that Leia and the galaxy were in danger. Luke remained hidden even after multiple planets were blown up and Han died.

JJ fucked up Luke's arc. TLJ gave Luke the perfect story of a Jedi Master. He clowned the First Order and sacrificed himself to save everyone else, but didn't use any real or direct violence."

>But to say that a producer has zero effect on the production outside of logistics is naive at best.

And it's naive to pretend she was the reason Spielberg or Lucas made great movies. They made great movies long before she ever stepped foot on their sets

>That's like arguing Bill Belichick is a mediocre coach because of his his current season after Tom Brady left this year. Both are collaborative fields. 

Except Belichick was a good coach long before Tom Brady ever stepped foot on an NFL field. Kathleen Kennedy was nothing before Spielberg & Lucas and since leaving their movies she's been mediocre at best. Most of the movies are just bad. Just look at OP's list. A super majority of their list is Spielberg produced/directed movies or movies directed by already well known directors considered great. If you pluck Spielberg movies & directors already nominated for Oscars before she produced one of their movies out of her filmography, it's a bunch of mediocre to bad movies.

Yoda. The emperor is also a relatively unimportant character in the original fims, and while he's introduced in the second one, the far more important element introduced is Vader being Luke's father.

Thanos is also an exception. A key part of Marvel's success is that they tell concise and clear individual stories. They have successfully built a big movie series while keeping the 'this is for a future one' element as limited as possible.

TFA is an aberration, the whole movie is just built on mysteries the audience hopes will mean something later. It acts more like a pilot of a mystery series, like Lost, than an actual story. This is not actually how these things are made."

Like, you can always just come up with a reason why it works or doesn’t work. 

One example I have is Lord of the Rings. People often like to bring up the eagles and why could they just be flown to modor. The usual answer is “well there wouldn’t be a story then” but there’s actual in universe reasons why this wouldn’t work. Modor had legions of orc archers, what if the eagles would have just been shot down? Plus the ring wraiths are flying around on monsters, what if those monsters just intercepted the eagles? Suddenly the whole thing is less of a plot hole because there are two very easy reasons to say why it isn’t. 

It’s the same with the Holdo maneuver. First of all, something sorta on the same principal happened in an episode of the clone wars, where Anakin made a ship crash into a moon during a jump to hyperspace. Replace a moon with a fleet, and you’ve got something similar. So some of the rules are already established canon.

My original comment I said that he's not wrong for not liking the movie. It's perfectly fine to not like something. Compare TLJ to TFA...one is essentially a remake of an older movie is people loved it the other isn't that and people hated it. The obvious connection is obvious.

>Are there some fans who would like to experience loose remakes of the original trilogy over and over? Sure, but they clearly are not a very vocal part, and likely not a silent majority either.

Again, that's movies. Some people will like while others won't. I'm speaking from someone who isn't a Star Wars fan. When people say that they hated the character of Luke and say that he was ruined. I liked that that Luke had a moment of weakness. A moment of doubt. It shows that he *is* human and brings a dynamic to his character as to why he is where he is in the movie.

People are sometimes stuck in a box because they can't be creative with risks...and this is why you don't see big movies do risky things. And as I said, some people didn't like...not liking it isn't the problem but not wanting creatives to try something new is what's bad. That was my point.

What ""new"" can you do with Star Wars? The only ""new* thing you can do is tell a story about new characters, which the new trilogies weren't even about.

>I would consider myself a fan, and my favorite Star Wars story, outside of the original trilogy, is Knights of the Old Republic 2, which plays with the core concept of the force and the light and dark side a fair bit. It is not like I am a weirdo star wars fan, since it is easy to find other Star Wars fans praise the game's story an writing.

I feel that video games is a medium that can play around with things more. The best thing about the new trilogy wasn't even explored and honestly that's the worse part because given the freedom, I do feel that more could have been done and expanded upon.

Again, in my original comment I said that not liking the movie is fine...but at the same time they said that the prequels furthered the story. How did the prequels do that when they led to something we already knew? That's not furthering anything."

How is this a shot at the Disney trilogy (also I love that you think there are factions within Disney/Lucasfilm that are battling each other with quips in their projects - all of which are still produced by Kennedy)? This isn't an idea that was challenged by any of the sequels. Training is obviously very important and Luke says that Rey needs training, he just didn't want to be the one to do it because of the consequences if it went wrong.

And he still changes his mind by the end and then Rey gets training from Leia in the next movie. Rey is a fully trained Jedi by the end of those movies whether you like them or not."

I think what's frustrating about TROS for me is that there's a kernel of a passable and maybe even good movie, but it's just larded under too much stuff going on. Like Palpatine's back, fine. But do we need a multipart scavenger hunt where our heroes go to one planet to find a dagger after which they need to go to another planet to jailbreak 3PO to read in order to send them to a third planet to find the magic GPS which will take them to a fourth planet? Does Rey need to be Palps' heir and does Kylo need to put his mask back together?

They really could've pared it down to ""Palpatine returning"" without all this extra stuff. Just say he somehow clung to life as a force ghost and is now offering Kylo more power in exchange to restoring him to full life or something. He doesn't have to have been pulling the strings, just biding his time for the right moment to make a move. Snoke didn't need to be his puppet, just an obstacle Kylo cleared for him."

6448,2020-12-29 16:58:11,km5rjt,"Please learn to read. I specified “reboots of famous properties” and “the last decade an a half” for a reason. The only franchise here that’s relevant is the Star Wars prequel trilogy, where, as you can see, it had a 35% drop between the first and second film and the first film, and the anticipated return of a long dormant franchise had a bigger opening in its first release than its subsequent sequels. Holy shit man. Thanks for accidentally proving exactly my point for me.

I don’t know what point you’re trying to prove or why you think The Matrix, an original property from 1999, would be more relevant to tracking box office trends to compare to the Disney Star Wars films than the current examples I listed in my comment. I mean shit, just look at how different all these numbers are here... Martix 1 and 3 had similar returns and the second did almost double the others. Batman had a modest opening and then exploded, tripling for 2 and staying steady for 3. Harry Potter had a big start, slight drop then stayed steady until it’s highly anticipated conclusion bumped up up by 30%. Lord of the Rings had a steady increase amidst its three. The Hobbit stayed pretty much the same through all three. Serious question: when you put these together, did you think you were making a point about box office patterns? Because you just took big franchises from 1999 all the way up to 2019 and they ALL have different box office trends EXCEPT **the two Star Wars one where there was a big dropoff from 1 to 2 based on there obviously being more excitement for the first than the second which was precisely my point about rebooted franchises in 21st century Hollywood**. So again, thank you for compiling this information which supports my argument.

You also once again chose to respond to one aspect of my comment because you don’t have an adequate response for the rest.

I get it. You hated the Disney sequel trilogy. But if you’re looking at where Star Wars is as a franchise right now with how many future projects they have in the works and you think there’s some sort of unprecedented failure going on and that the numbers back up that it was because of TLJ... my guy, you’re just wrong."

This shouldn't be seen as evidence of consistency... but in inconsistency.  He's already been through these trials and tribulations and became the person he is.  Now he's going through trials and tribulations but acting in an exact opposite manner from where his character already ended up.

Its like having a coward find their courage, and then in the next movie they are ashamed of being a coward.  So they didn't learn anything from their arc?  Why even bother with the arc then!?!

The pipelines habe stayed the same more or less,so whatever x,y&z she did for Sequels she did for all other SW media,including Mando.

It seems to me that you are working backwards from the statemt that execs tanked Sequels and Mando somehow has no executive branch that does the non-creative part of production,financing,brand management,advertising etc boring stuff.

No.  You are wrong:

>was shocked the sequel trilogy wasn't planned out

OP said Rian claimed there wasn't a plan.  I countered that with numerous points, with evidence, that claimed otherwise.  He then moved the goal post to claim they weren't 'codified' (by which I'm assuming he meant scripts) which was never his argument to start with.  

He then claimed I said that full scripts were written, which I blatantly did not say.  I quoted someone else, who was involved in the movies, who said their were drafts (and drafts =/= scripts.  I'm not even willing to discuss/debate this.. its so far from being true.  A script can have a draft, but that doesn't make a draft a script).

It doesn't matter how hard you try and fight it... its truth.

If you care so little, why do you continue to spit so many fallacies to defend another persons argument that was clearly debunked?

Script:
> the written text of a stage play, screenplay, or broadcast **specifically : the one used in production or performance**

Draft:
>**a preliminary version** of a piece of writing.

To go along with yet another reminder that I didn't say it in the first place, and was countering there was ""no plan"".  

But it does raise an interesting point. Does it suck being this blatantly wrong this often?  Perhaps if you weren't so mad and just accepted facts.
