3,2020-01-24 07:20:01,et5kz9,"I think Hollywood casting directors are mostly unaware of the difference between full Asian and half Asian. It's only Asian viewers who are bothered by these choices. Hopefully this will be a new area that will improve in the future. 

I do think that half Asian men are preferred over full Asian men, because Asian men just aren't desired in the West. For women, both full and mixed Asian women are fine as long as they fit the conventional beauty standard."
4,2020-01-24 16:33:30,et5kz9,"I think this is interesting for me to hear about a a monoracial Asian woman because like, my entire life I've heard about how beautiful mixed white-Asian babies are (from my mom, other older Chinese women) and how I should have kids with a white guy, and how they'd be so cute. So in a way I've almost always felt they've been valued in a category above me. 

I am definitely struck by the invisibility of, as you point out, Asian women who are mixed black, latina, indigenous, etc. Karreuche Tran, Chanel Iman, H.E.R., etc are not racialized as Asian in the way that many mixed-white Asian women are, and whenever it is known it's pointed out in a very 'shocking!!! did you know?' way."

And a lot of pageant queens from countries like the Philippines are mixed race too. I'm just Asian and I'm not skinny or sleek. I think it's hard to conform to stereotypes regardless of our racial background. 

I think mixed race Asian women have been hired to play non-mixed Asian women too, like Maya Erskine in Plus One or Sonoya Mizuno in Crazy Rich Asians."
6,2020-01-24 16:42:32,et5kz9,"Such a thoughtful post! Everything is always harder for femmes but starting such a dialogue is cathartic. What do you think about the  role white supremacy plays in all of this? I know you aren't talking about blasians for other reasons but I am just curious to know your thoughts on eurocentric beauty standards (frail, white, small, quiet being the most feminine ideal) and cultural conditioning in general?"
7,2020-02-06 16:47:46,et5kz9,"So I know this post is a couple of weeks old but wanted to add another example. Insecure (HBO) has very minimal placement of Asian characters despite being set in LA, with three notable exceptions featuring three biracial Asian/white characters. There are two women, one played by Maya Erskine who is portrayed as being completely clueless about race dynamics at Issa Rae’s characters non-profit jobs - a workplace that is portrayed to be overwhelmingly staffed by white people despite serving  mainly black and Latinx kids and who are almost all completely ignorant to how paternalistic and white saviour-y their methods are. There is also one episode where a black male character has a threesome with a white woman and a half Asian/white woman who end up fetishizing him for being a black man. I remember seeing comments lambasting the stereotypical fetishizing of black men by white women, and when people would point out that one of the characters was half Asian, people brushed it off with “well, basically white then.”

On the flip side, a half Asian/white male character was introduced in the last season who is interested in Issa’s best friend. He is portrayed as the smoothest, wokest, most patient guy possible. References to his Asian-ness are frequently made.

So yeah, this dynamic is alive and well despite it otherwise being a show I really enjoy. But their attitude towards Asian characters, biracial or otherwise, has always sat poorly with me."
8,2020-01-24 19:17:12,et5kz9,"I guess people just want what they can't have, haha. 

Like, I never had nice, ink-black hair, which people typically cite as one of the ""beautiful"" aspects of Asian women. My hapa hair is poop-brown and straggly. There's also sometimes posts flexing in Subtle Asian Traits where Chinese and Korean girls boast about how they don't EVER grow leg hair and don't ever need deodorant, whereas my White genes cursed me to be a hairy, sweaty, freckly beast in comparison. My mom never had to shave, but I do lol. That's what feels kinda weird."
9,2020-01-24 13:46:37,et5kz9,"I think OP and you are both recognizing something true. I think that when a character is purposely designated as Asian, then you'll likely only get a full Asian (almost always East Asian) actress in that role.

However, when it comes to Asian representation in media as a whole, mixed Asian women are better represented. I think this is because if the race of a character is unassigned, this usually means white and mixed Asian women who look ""exotic"" while still fitting white standards of beauty are white passing enough for these roles. This ""ethnic"" but not too ethnic look is definitely a thing - Kim K, Emily Ratajkowski and Alexa Chung aren't blonde haired and blue eyed but still pass white standards of beauty. 

This obviously excludes any mixed Asian that isn't white passing and also fetishizes mixed Asians that are. It really sucks and I don't trust Hollywood to improve this unfortunately."
10,2020-01-24 07:15:20,et5kz9,">women like Kristin Kreuk, Chrissy Teigen, Olivia Munn, Chloe Bennett, Alexa Chung, Maggie Q, Lauren Tsai.

I think our society is one that racializes celebrities based on both how they look as well as their politics, and people like Olivia Munn and Kristin Kreuk aren't constantly being thrust into our faces as examples of ""Asian representation icons"" the way Lucy Liu and Lana Condor are. The media basically treats a certain subsect of hapa women like they're white with no regard for their Asian heritage whatsoever.

AAPI's aren't really upholding them as ""omg Asian queenz!!!!!"" or paragons of Asian excellence the way we (are kind of expected to) endlessly praise Charles Melton / Keanu Reeves as an ideal of Asian attractiveness.

&#x200B;

>I think mixed race Asian women have been hired to play non-mixed Asian women too

I don't know... while this has defs happened before, and I agree that whiteness is still the standard of beauty, the extent to which this applies might not be true. For example, Henry Golding gets cast in Crazy Rich Asians, which makes the #1 leading man in the biggest Asian identity film of the decade half-White, but I honestly can't see an equivalent thing - a hapa woman getting the role of Mulan or one of the Joy Luck Club protagonists - ever happening.

&#x200B;

>And a lot of pageant queens from countries like the Philippines are mixed race too.

I think in my original post I stated that I was mostly talking about how attractiveness is assessed in East Asians. I'm sure it's different in Southeast Asia, maybe because of the added dimension of colorism and how being mixed with White can often get kids to be paler. And I'd definitely say that the whole gender dynamic in different regions is different too - I think South Asian men are considered more palatable to White people than South Asian women are, which really sucks."
11,2020-01-24 07:46:57,et5kz9,"I don’t think Charles Melton is often held up as a paragon of Asian excellence because he is not that well-known. And a lot of people didn’t know that Keanu Reeves was partially Asian until Ali Wong made a big deal about it with Always Be My Maybe. 

A hapa woman wouldn’t get the role of a Mulan because it’s based on a figure in Chinese history. A non-Chinese Asian wouldn’t get that role either because it would alienate Chinese audiences. 

I think part-White Asian women are idolized in East Asia too. Look at Angelababy, or Taiwanese singer Jay Chou’s wife or at Ella Gross, a half-Korean half-white child model who has almost 4 million Instagram followers."
12,2020-01-23 07:17:19,esoge6,"YES I have noticed this and it has bugged me, especially as someone who cares about both mixed race representation and asian representation.

 I feel as a mixed person, I totally want us to have more representation; i would cry if i ever saw a family on screen like my own. BUT, mixed people (especially those of us who are half white) are not Hollywood's ""answer"" to more representation of POC, as I personally feel we have been used as. Like you've pointed out, I've noticed this happens a lot with mixed men being cast in monoracial roles. Mixed men (usually half white) are not substitutes for monoracial men! The casting of the main love interest in The Sun is Also a Star reaaally bugged me because the actors playing his family were monoracial (and all korean actors playing korean roles which is so rare for people to be cast correctly for the ethnicity of the role they're playing), and yet they decided to cast a mixed actor as the main romantic interest.... uhh... Maybe this is me being ""sensitive"" but how does that not reek of the old stereotypes about the asian man not being desired. Why couldn't they cast a full korean man in that role? They were totally capable of casting korean actors for the family soooooo where's the disconnect??

Interestingly I never really noticed mixed women being played by monoracial actress, despite being a mixed girl. Maybe it was just normalized or something but the first time I really took notice was with Lana Condor in To All The Boys I Loved Before. And it really bugged me because in my opinion, it was for no absolute reason. Her sisters were played by mixed actress, so again.... where's the disconnect??? And honestly I feel bad about being negative about her casting because I've seen many young asian girls being happy about seeing an asian girl represented on screen, but that character was a mixed girl and her identity as a mixed person was discussed in the books. 

Ultimately I think it comes down to the orientalism that's still pervasive in ""the West."" Asian women are only allowed to be small, petite, feminine and if they're not, then fuck them basically. Casting monoracial asian women in mixed roles upholds the stereotype of asian women and doesn't  hurt the poor minds of non asians to be confronted with a different type of asian woman. As for mixed men being cast in monoracial roles, I definitely think it's connected to asian-ness equating to femininity and femininity being devalued; a monoracial asian man can't be cast because asian men are feminine and leading men can't be feminine blah blah. I think this all connects back to the monolith of asian identities in the ""West"". People think mixed and monoracial asians can just be switched around because we're all the same and it doesn't matter... ugh

It's all bs and honestly in this day and age, I really think there's any excuse for this. There are so many diverse, talented actors looking for work.... NO EXCUSE!

anyway this is rambly and probably incoherent but yeah..."

Where is the Black Community “solidarity” with Asians when we have been dealing with COVID prompted Racist attacks, that have also been caught on film?

I know, assault and murder are different things, but the imbalance of Asians supporting blacks vs Blacks supporting Asians is too apparent. 
And the fact that many of these incidences are actually blacks committing the acts is troubling, yet we still offer support..

Yes, there are individuals who support African Americans, but collectively speaking is it enough to say Asians as a whole have shown support for Black people? No. I’ve also seen a fair enough of Asians engage in Anti-Blackness. There was also an Asian American officer involved in this case, too. We must take ownership of that. We have experienced racism before COVID-19. But it was being seen as the other, not as a threat. If you learned anything from the racism from COVID-19, you should realize this has been the reality for Black people, Latinx and Muslim people for years with greater intensities."

Never forget Jesse Jackson spoke out for Vincent Chin.

Never forget when filipinos went on labor strike and instead of scabbing like they were called in to do, Latino Americans led by Cesar Chavez joined them and formed the United Farm Workers.

We don't forgive the individuals who beat our poor helpless asian grandmas and grandpas, who robbed us, but we should choose to be represented by the best among us and the best among our allies. The ones who did that, we want to be punished, but as far as the larger movement is concerned, we have to look beyond that as long as prominent Black and Latinx figures make the effort too."

205,2020-05-30 05:12:33,gsx8py,"The Spike Lee spot is more an Anti-Trump instead of whole-hearted support for Asians. 

Cardi-B, really?

RZA - Is the only one that actually provides meaningful words of support. 

Who else?

You see my point? You have to scour the internet to find any, and while in this Reddit post alone shows how many dozens of Asians supporting the Black community? 

It feels imbalanced and when you watch a video of black teens kicking an Asian Grandma in the face while being dared and laughing the whole time, with zero condemnation from the Black community, how are we to feel? 

This isn’t right. There is no real social justice for Asians in America."

207,2020-05-28 00:33:45,grsyfe,Robin DiAngel 's book White Fragility  helped me reflect upon and understand alot of my experiences in the corporate world which didn't make sense to me at the time. It should be required reading for all asian americans. I wish I had this book over a decade ago. I just hope the next generation of asian americans do not repeat the same mistakes I did and break the cycle of internal racism perpetuated by opportunists.
208,2020-05-28 00:07:38,grsyfe,"I think as a whole if you're a minority and you focus on only US media, you'll only ever end up having one viewpoint (should be common sense by now).

Your reluctance to recognize and target white women as potential threats along w/your eagerness to focus on the confused Asian woman(or any other non-white person) just proves how well white supremacy works."

Just in the last few days.  There is a lot of criticism of white women, and there is plenty of praise for  AF's  - not all AF's - just as we don't praise all AM's - just the men and women who respect themselves and avoid white worship."
216,2020-05-28 11:17:10,grsyfe,It's too much....I  am not a writer sorry.  I've seen some pretty awful things happen  to people and lots of subtle shit happen to me that I attributed to personal issues and not racism.
217,2020-05-28 17:55:23,grsyfe,"Oh gad, that's too depressing to write.  I am not a writer, I am sorry I can't."
218,2020-05-29 15:25:05,grsyfe,"If you recognize that white men are a threat, even to the children of both AM and AF w/white partners---what good is it to target one gendered side of racism when they depend upon each other to exist?

You're honestly telling me that white women get a proportional amount of criticism in this sub, especially in contrast w/Asian women? I'm gonna need A LOT more evidence than one post and a handful of comments deriding feminism to buy into that."
219,2020-05-28 15:30:59,grsyfe,"You don't have to do it now or right away.  But in my view, decoding white behavior and dynamics is crucial to ensure others don't fall into the traps we did.  It's hard because there is often trauma in those incidents when we look back on them; in my case I needed enough time (years) from when they happened to talk about them.   But while we get a lot of 'ripped from the headlines' posts on AI, the ones that will help the community are never going to be published in any media outlet; they're from our own experiences."
220,2020-05-29 20:11:25,grsyfe,"To be fair, you said we exonerated the role of white women.  I posted links showing we do no such thing.  Will you acknowledge that AznIdentity recgonizes the racism of white women?

I don't think we need to show it is proportional because insofar as we are against systemic and institutional racism, **that is based on power** and as I showed, and you can self-educate if you don't believe me, it is White Men who hold the power and therefore systemic and institutional racism traces to them- their actions, their biases.  We don't exonerate WW for their contributions, but if we want to subvert the structures of power - we need to address those that hold it.

For individual anti-Asian racism, we hold all accountable, men, women, white, mixed, black, even Asian."
221,2020-05-29 21:54:32,grsyfe,"I did not say exonerated, knock it off---I said you're being reluctant to identify the essential role they represent in a system of racism. They have more power than you. They wield more influence than you do.

See again, it doesn't help your argument that white men are holding all the power when it's white women who produce, nurture and instruct white offspring. That's *way* beyond anything white men are able to do alone. Lol non-white women, I don't care how much they want to, are incapable of doing this. It's always a shitshow.

I just want the truth to be told. Any hesitation to acknowledge the way white supremacy operates is not constructive and can be deadly."
222,2020-05-24 23:03:17,gpzcak,If Revys actor ain't at least part Asian I won't even watch it tbh
223,2020-05-25 00:06:10,gpzcak,personally I don't really care about the actor’s origins as long as they looks like their characters
224,2020-05-31 20:49:19,gpzcak,I have no faith in Hollywood to do it justice.
225,2020-05-24 23:01:37,gpzcak,No Charlize Theron for Eda? I would think she would brilliant pull off all sides/faces of Eda.
226,2020-05-25 01:18:49,gpzcak,"I would definitely love a well-done action-live and true to the Black Lagoon anime.

But I know practically nothing about artists to play roles, because I was never a fan of the artistic environment.

But I would like the characters to have their origins respected when being played.

Like Revy being played by an American Chinese and Balalaika being played by a Russian actress."
227,2020-05-25 01:57:51,gpzcak,The fact that I don't know most of these actors shows how old I am
228,2020-05-25 06:52:04,gpzcak,Why not chow yun fat as Mr Chang ?
229,2020-05-31 13:27:32,gpzcak,"There's only one actress I could see as Balalaika, and that's Cate Blanchett."
230,2020-05-24 23:48:23,gpzcak,"All of my options are. I saw people suggest Roony Mara and Eliza Dushku. Like, no!"
231,2020-05-25 01:16:46,gpzcak,Why??
232,2020-06-01 01:01:14,gpzcak,Hollywood did have one good one. I'm just asking for the sake of a fun idea of visualizing it.
233,2020-05-24 23:52:10,gpzcak,"I think Eda isn't sophisiticated enough for Charlize Theron. Maybe she can be Balalaika, but I'd like to see her do a Russian accent. Then again, seeing her play a somewhat trashy role would stretch her skills a bit..."
234,2020-05-25 03:15:36,gpzcak,"Don't feel alone, because I also don't know almost anyone lol."
235,2020-05-25 19:27:46,gpzcak,That can be a good thing. Seeing the same actor in multiple roles can ruin the immersion of movies you see.
236,2020-05-25 01:22:56,gpzcak,Because she literally calls herself a chinese ghetto bitch in her dialogue. To whitewash that would be as distracting as Tom Cruise in the Last Samurai
237,2020-05-24 23:56:33,gpzcak,"Eda when she’s in CIA garb is very sophisticated and professional.

And Charlize can do trashy. Have you seen Monster?"
238,2020-05-25 03:22:50,gpzcak,I mean I pretty much watched Black Lagoon original run (although I was too young to comprehend it). I think the time for me knowing young actors is passed.
239,2020-05-25 19:50:36,gpzcak,I wouldn't notice the difference. I don't watch many movies. The last movie I watched came out in 2014.
240,2020-05-25 00:56:21,gpzcak,"I acutally heard about it, but never seen it."
241,2020-05-25 00:57:08,gpzcak,You won’t even recognize her. And her performance is incredible.
242,2020-05-24 03:25:28,gp219z,They did her dirty in Apocalypse. They could have her reprise the role because she barely played her the first time.
243,2020-05-23 16:04:47,gp219z,she's not coming back... Marvel are recasting all mutants except Deadpool
244,2020-05-24 03:48:54,gp219z,"That's what I'm saying, give her some proper justice."

I think Lana tends to wear more loose, drapy fabrics while Janel likes more structured tailored looks?

I think they are both really stylish and usually wears what flatters them, I just can’t tell why it works exactly since they have similar small statures. Lana’s original post: https://www.instagram.com/p/B9SbvOmlgIT/?igshid=n2c309af6mx9"

It does seem fairly common! I wonder why this is—just a coincidence, or maybe something about their structure makes them suited for it?"
293,2020-08-14 23:26:31,i9v3op,yeah i think they maybe did her makeup in a slightly different way! or the lighting
294,2020-08-14 23:38:42,i9v3op,"The striped top she wore when seeing Margo off at the airport looked constricting too.

Edit: Funnily I used to want to emulate her style (and Veronica Lodge too). 😅"
295,2020-08-14 23:30:36,i9v3op,Hm do you think tops with looser/more flowy fabric around the shoulders would suit her better? I agree that her style in the films were a bit off somehow/stiffer as opposed to her style in real life
296,2020-08-15 03:38:32,i9v3op,"I've noticed it too! I think it's because they have that Girl Next Door look, and they always look super pretty with their hair natural/undone. 🤗"

I don't see visual weight in her upper body her shoulder line seems a bit wide but light visually to me"
301,2020-08-15 02:31:18,i9v3op,"I kinda wonder now if there would be a better way to style naturals in a vintage/contemporary style rather than how the stylists did here, as many vintage fits tend toward gamine lines"

521,2020-12-01 07:05:46,k4fjpk,"Western representation will always be what it's meant to be, racist propaganda. I don't think we need to think much about it because ultimately, these Western shows are much more irrelevant than people would like to admit. None of these Western movies or shows can even come close to Asian movies and dramas when it comes to representation. Western representation is a joke that's gone on for long enough. 

Netflix is paying good money for Asian dramas and I think it's great that Asian dramas are more accessible to people worldwide. When it comes to Asian dramas, there are no racist agendas when it comes to Asian people. I get to watch all Asian casts with almost all full Asians and enjoy myself rather than having to analyze everything that Western media is handing me. 

Notice how the person making the comment was talking about K-dramas instead of Netflix's Western shows. When people want to watch hot Asians doing shit, they go for K-dramas, not Lara fucking Condor. 

As Asian people, we just need to stop handing white people the opportunity to push their agendas onto us and just stick to Asian dramas like normal fucking human beings. J-dramas, K-dramas, C-dramas, and etc. have been here for a long ass time already. Shit like Crazy Rich Asians just makes us look bad especially when people actually expected Asians in Asian countries to watch that white approved garbage."
522,2020-12-01 09:02:58,k4fjpk,"i would say avoid Netflix. their history is not very good as far as AM rep is concerned. 

not to mention all the WMAF shit they have.

their library of Kdramas isn't worth paying for...it is only a very small percentage in a sea of garbage western content. not to mention it is the same shit over and over."
523,2020-12-01 07:29:42,k4fjpk,Pretty terrible. I can name only one heterosexual AM character on netflix.
524,2020-12-01 18:18:38,k4fjpk," **Obviously not all Korean men look like K-drama actors, but it's still making a positive difference.** 

duh. why does everyone feel the need to remind us that asian men arent perfect? they dont do that with any other race of men (or women, either, now that i think about it) does society just not want asian guys to be seen as hot?"
525,2020-12-01 19:47:26,k4fjpk,">American women are seeing Asian men in starring roles, and it is definitely having a positive effect on the way we view Asian men

These roles are in Korean dramas where they are speaking Korean. There is still a sense of exoticism because of this and although it does raise the status of AMs it doesn't do as much for AMs in Western countries. In Western movies you mostly see AFs with XMs.

Netflix is garbage. Save your money and stop supporting their garbage."
526,2020-12-01 20:57:29,k4fjpk,"Netflix has actively edited out kissing/romantic scenes out of their licensed Asian content like Train to Busan and Ilang: The Wolf Brigade. They are trying to white wash the live action Avatar the Last air bender series they are producing, to the point where the original creators of the series(who were asked to helm the live action) left the project. Netflix only wants Asian content because there is an international demand. Even so, they will find ways to snub Asians while still profiting off of Asian content."
527,2020-12-01 16:54:29,k4fjpk,"I have Netflix and barely watch it, I feel there's nothing but garbage and from time to time will be something good. As far as the cons they are no different than regular media so I'm not shocked. But what other options do we have. Just like Black people had BET how can we develop something like that with little to zero assistance from motherland countries."
528,2020-12-01 18:17:02,k4fjpk,where are the gay asian male characters? i've been watching all the wrong shows
529,2020-12-01 14:47:17,k4fjpk,"netflix is fine- ppl demonize it here because it does have a lot of content promoting WMAF but that’s not Netflix as a whole to blame, it’s the individual producers. It also has pro AM content. Just watch the good stuff and avoid/downvote the bad stuff- in fact that’s even more helpful than boycotting netflix because this way you’ll affect their big data algorithms - signaling them to create more pro AM stuff"
530,2020-12-07 21:06:20,k4fjpk,Wu Assassins was a great series with great representation. Altered Carbon season 1 was awesome and had pretty good representation.
531,2020-12-01 07:52:26,k4fjpk,Is he fully Asian? And does he get laid on screen?
532,2020-12-01 22:51:31,k4fjpk,">duh. why does everyone feel the need to remind us that asian men arent perfect? they dont do that with any other race of men (or women, either, now that i think about it) does society just not want asian guys to be seen as hot?

Exactly. 

A lot of Westernized Asian men themselves do it too. Totally self sabotaging themselves: ""Oh, most Korean men don't look like Kpop idols or Kdrama actors! They're not real! Don't fawn over them! They're all fake and girly! Don't be fooled by Kpop and Kdrama!"" 

But no one says ""Oh, most white men don't look like Brad Pitt or George Clooney! They look nothing like Hollywood actors! They're all ugly! Don't be fooled by  Hollywood! It's all lies!"""
533,2020-12-01 12:02:27,k4fjpk,Kims convenience maybe

its honestly super sad seeing them do that. and then 5 minutes later theyre complaining that 'girls dont like me b/c i'm asian' like DUDE!!! kpop/kdrama fans were drooling over you just now but you said you hated kpop because 'it creates an unrealistic expectiation of asian men' we're not asking for perfection!! we're just asking for a respectful relationship and for you to have good skin!!! is that a lot?? NOOOOO IT ISNT!!! and then you find out he's pining over a lu who's dating a pedophile/neo nazi (slight exaggeration but whatever) like WHAT THE HELL!!!!!!!!!
rant over. idk if i'm coming across too angry abt this but its so damn frustrating"
535,2020-12-02 01:35:59,k4fjpk,">idk if i'm coming across too angry abt this but its so damn frustrating

No, you're not. I feel you!

Nothing more frustrating/annoying than self hating, self sabotaging people!"
