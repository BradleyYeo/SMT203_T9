0,2020-02-05 18:11:39,ez9yhh,"Very nice visualization, it really drives the point home that the *only* event where Simone isn't dominant is uneven bars.

In the recent Fig World of Gymnastics Magazine, which is available online [here](https://www.gymnastics.sport/site/news/displaynews.php?idNews=2800), they had a couple of more stats from Worlds, about Simone's impressive performance. Her 9.666 execution score  on the Amanar in the vault final was highest execution score in the championships, among both men and women; She's the only one to get above a 15 on beam during the championship; Her 1 point margin of victory in the floor event final was the biggest margin of victory in any event final in championship."
1,2020-02-05 15:23:14,ez9yhh,Okay as a data geek this breakdown is friggen beautiful
2,2020-02-05 18:40:35,ez9yhh,"I would love to see something similar to this, but showing the score differences. Like how she won't just get gold, but she'll get it by some ridiculously large margin."
3,2020-02-05 14:38:34,ez9yhh,Thank this is really helpful to visualize graphically.
4,2020-02-05 18:30:50,ez9yhh,"It's always incredible to live in the time when a new GOAT comes along. Sometimes you forget as you're watching them just BE so good, but as the years pass or when they're no longer competing you look back like damn, no one is as good haha. Serena, Tom Brady, Lebron and Simone have all been insane to witness."
5,2020-02-05 18:29:02,ez9yhh,This visual is awesome. Aside from showing how impressive Simone is it also reminded me of how amazing Mustafina was as well. God I want her back for Tokyo so bad even if it’s just for a team medal.
6,2020-02-06 07:46:45,ez9yhh,"I enjoyed this so much! Thank you, OP. My thoughts while reading along:

- Simone either wins beam, or she has a bad day. A bad day for Simone is a bronze.

- Morgan being fourth most dominant all arounder since 2010, by this metric. Screw the haters.

- Aly on floor ❤️

- Other than bars, Simone has been on the podium on every event she has competed in at Worlds and the Olympics since she turned senior.

- Aliya is one of the all time greats. She features in every graphic except beam.

- The USA is not papered all over these graphs. China and Russia make solid appearances, with a few other countries making the list.

- Simone ❤️"
7,2020-02-05 23:55:00,ez9yhh,The gym she trained at is like 2 minutes from my house.  I always wondered who that person was whose picture is plastered all over the front of that gymnastics gym.
8,2020-02-06 13:01:18,ez9yhh,Wow!
9,2020-02-05 22:13:03,ez9yhh,"Not dominant, but still a world silver medallist."
10,2020-02-06 09:58:00,ez9yhh,"Her Amanar was soooo beautiful. I watch it on Youtube at least once a week for inspiration. I can't even do a handstand, but it inspires me to work hard in all areas of life like education, work, sports, etc... I love Simone."
11,2020-02-05 18:50:54,ez9yhh,"[Here you go](https://themedalcount.com/2019/07/18/259/)

Simone's 2016 Margin of Victory was only slightly less than all the Margin of Victories from the 1972 Olympics to the 2012 Olympics...combined."
12,2020-02-05 18:59:23,ez9yhh,Thanks! Holy cow!

Simone: supposedly likely @ Tokyo AA Cup (~April 3rd)

Aliya: who the heck knows/apparently isn't even training right now"
16,2020-02-03 23:32:06,eybgfm,"Aliya hasnt been at camp since Summer. She is waiting to find the passion, and drive again per her interview with Gymnovosti a few weeks back.   Nikita nagornyy also had a recent interview  on Jan 30th,  

***Q:*** *Why is the men’s gymnastics stronger at the moment in Russia?*

**A:** Honestly, I don’t know. I guess that’s the case everywhere. You cannot always be the first, sooner or later someone stronger will appear. You cannot always stay young and be at the peak of your strength. Unfortunately, the leader of the women’s team Aliya Mustafina is absent at the moment, she is missed. Other girls retired, a new generation came. Generally, they are winning medals and that’s good."
17,2020-02-04 20:06:15,eybgfm,Does anyone know if we are going to see Laurie compete?
18,2020-02-03 18:38:52,eybgfm,ayy thanks for the quick reply. i haven’t seen much training for aliya but i’ve also heard that she’s aiming for tokyo olympics so thanks.
19,2020-02-06 02:02:16,eybgfm,"I would guess she is probably be aiming to do a couple events at Classic. Not sure if she could petition into the competition, as a former Olympic team member/medalist, but I believe they usually can. I doubt she would be given any other types of assignments earlier in the season, as she is likely still working on regaining her form across the events, based on what we've seen so far."
20,2020-02-03 21:09:31,eybgfm,She's been waiting to regain the passion to justify spending all of her time in the gym. Hopefully she will soon!
21,2020-02-02 20:19:38,extrh4,Kind of an old story to post today.
22,2020-02-02 20:02:51,extrh4,"She’s 44?!

I guess she has been practicing much longer than most of her competition.

[edit: she’s not. Poorly placed link to another story about another athlete.]"
23,2020-02-02 20:22:35,extrh4,She's 22. That's a link to a different article
24,2020-02-02 20:23:24,extrh4,"No, she's 22, the 44-year-old gymnast is a link to another article."
25,2020-02-02 20:39:49,extrh4,Thanks. It didn’t look that way on my phone.
26,2020-01-30 20:14:37,ewbb81,She should balance on my beem
27,2020-01-31 02:24:53,ewbb81,Good lord
28,2020-01-31 05:48:50,ewbb81,I love me some gymnast booty.
29,2020-01-30 20:33:21,ewbb81,Very true. That ass is magnificent
30,2020-01-31 10:37:04,ewbb81,American exceptionalism!
31,2020-01-31 04:13:26,ewbb81,Gross!
32,2020-01-30 20:24:58,ewbb81,Breathtaking ass. I would eat her ass for days. She is giving me a boner. I need to JO and unload my balls. Kik  toobonedup
33,2020-01-30 22:17:43,ewbb81,Best part is that she is so small and so young. You could really mandhandle her and really have your way with her.
34,2020-01-30 20:32:15,ewbb81,Her boyfriend is very lucky to enjoy her every day
35,2020-01-30 22:24:57,ewbb81,"Well, she's stronger than a lot of guys. But yea she's tiny."
36,2020-01-31 02:42:10,ewbb81,"I think she could have a promising run in mma once she's accomplished everything she sets out to do in gymnastics.

Flexibility is useful in bjj and her power would be insane for striking"
37,2020-01-31 16:00:06,ewbb81,"She's 4'8""..."
38,2020-01-31 16:07:33,ewbb81,There are weight classes for that reason
39,2020-01-31 16:14:52,ewbb81,"She's 104 pounds. Strawweight is 115, so she'd be giving up a 10% weight advantage."
40,2020-01-31 19:22:08,ewbb81,No doubt she'd bulk up to be maximally competitive. It's unlikely she will even go that route but I'd be highly entertained to see it
41,2020-01-31 00:47:00,ewbat4,4’8” bundle of flexible muscle.. mmm
42,2020-01-30 00:00:47,evuktl,I really needed this. I keep feeling horrible about myself despite my accomplishments.
43,2020-01-30 02:28:21,evuktl,[deleted]
44,2020-01-30 01:46:39,evuktl,"The magic isn't in the accomplishments, it's in you! You are so much more than that. When I start to feel bad about myself, I focus on taking care of myself. Exercising regularly and taking time to spend by myself, preferably walking through nature, helps a lot. It helps me to remember that my life is also for me."
45,2020-01-30 12:08:24,evuktl,"Accomplishments can be so important. I had a really difficult experience in college, and I was feeling extremely down about it right up until the point where they started getting close to calling my name at graduation. It just hit me all of a sudden that *I have an education*, and nobody can take that away from me. I felt like so many things had been taken from me across the course of my life. But this was something no one could steal, or break, or dismiss. It was mine. 

Don't let anyone make you feel diminished. You have a treasure trove they can't raid. Your accomplishments belong to you, and no one else. Nobody gets to decide their worth - and your worth - except you."
46,2020-01-30 03:07:12,evuktl,"True, animals perceive beauty as well. I don't think it's that complex though. I think to find something beautiful is simply to experience its loveliness. I don't think real beauty can be influenced by the media. I think conventional attractiveness is, but that's constantly changing as well. Lust sometimes accompanies beauty but is in no way the same thing. Beauty is so much deeper than that, and it stems from within."
47,2020-01-30 02:10:34,evuktl,Yeah I’m still trying to learn how to care for myself properly.
48,2020-01-30 12:30:54,evuktl,Thank you ☺️

63,2020-01-27 14:52:21,euo4wu,"Handspring vaults are actually more popular than you might think. In 2019 the vault final featured two Rudis and the Yeo, in 2018 four Rudis (that's half of the gymnasts who made the final!). The DTT has also gotten very popular among the Chinese, and we see at least one in each vault final as well.

So it's been pretty diverse in terms of vaulting recently, even though the medalists very often end up being the one's using the formular of Yurchenko + Yurchenko 1/2 on."
64,2020-01-27 15:54:02,euo4wu,"Alexa Moreno won bronze at 2018 Worlds with Rudi and Tsuk entries

Also, Chuso does front entry vaults!"
65,2020-01-27 14:38:14,euo4wu,There are historically less form deductions on round off entry vaults.
66,2020-01-27 21:38:01,euo4wu,What happened to all of the amanars? In 2012 everyone could do it.
67,2020-01-27 23:57:48,euo4wu,"http://fulltwist.net/is-the-rudi-as-difficult-as-the-amanar/


This article talks about the skill difference between amanars and rudis and it agrees with what I have always thought, that the rudi is harder or at least just as hard as the amanar. I think its under performed because the yurchenko style seems easier to get power from, if it were only about how hard it is to do a certain number or twists, the 1.5 twist of a rudi which is valued 5.8  would be done way more often than the DTY which is based at 5.4."
68,2020-01-27 18:16:46,euo4wu,I think it’s also easier to get a good block with a yurchenko vault.
69,2020-01-27 22:10:36,euo4wu,"In the 2012 code of points, the Amanar was worth 0.7 points more than the DTY. In the last two revisions to the COP, they've devalued the Amanar relative to other vaults. It is now only worth 0.4 points more than the DTY. I think that's why we used to see so many gymnasts attempt questionable Amanars, because there was such a cushion with the high value that they could still score well. Now it makes more sense to go with a clean DTY if they don't quite have the power for the extra half twist."
70,2020-01-27 22:06:29,euo4wu,"That's actually true as well! I noticed that too.

I think that the Amanar got downgraded in difficulty and became closer in start value to the DTY, so it now makes sense to throw a clean DTY rather than a messy Amanar."

The physically superior were sought after, while the inferior were left to die. Generations of physically superior beings were bred from only the most fit and resilient."
72,2020-01-27 10:17:56,eulmbe,I think they're just more likely to get into sports (in the US) because they have fewer options.
73,2020-01-27 09:33:05,eulmbe,"Sports were one of the earliest and 'fairest' ways for black people to earn recognition in America. This has remained true to some extent for poor people in general, and a fair amount of the relevant culture has also lingered surrounding devotion to sports."
74,2020-01-27 09:47:35,eulmbe,"Sub-Saharan Africans have much more genetic diversity than people outside of Africa. So if you look for people that have the most favorable genes for any specific thing, it is more likely to be an African than not."

They're worse swimmers, though."

Not to be negative but almost regardless of how much drive they'd have they wouldn't have the money or means to leave their life behind and we would never know about them, it's not at all hard to believe that somewhere on earth there might be children whose for fun foot races match speeds of Olympic athletes, but due to underdevelopment or other circumstances they remain undiscovered for all their life"
86,2020-01-25 19:42:17,etveov,Yeah high five✋
87,2020-01-26 02:02:37,etveov,I’ll grant that there are probably numerous people with the dna to be the fastest ones alive but with the amount of training that goes into Olympic level athletes I find it hard to believe an undiscovered athlete could come close. Even elite athletes gravitate toward elite coaches in other countries to gain that extra tenth.

96,2020-01-24 03:11:45,et350m,It's Shannon.
97,2020-01-24 02:49:18,et350m,"> Alicia Sacramone. 2nd most world medals ever with 10. Was not an All Around gymnast though, an event specialist. Only 1 Olympic medal, a team silver. **Pretty weak case IMO.**

Not only that but she benefited greatly from competing in the era where a specialist can rack up medals with Worlds being held every non-Olympic year. Put her in a different era and she doesn't come close to the same medal tally."
98,2020-01-24 02:57:58,et350m,I don't think it's just about medals. It's about how dominant they were. Can't just go by stats especially if they're from different quads
99,2020-01-24 12:09:45,et350m,I agree with others. You can’t just ignore Dawes.
100,2020-01-24 16:49:47,et350m,"Probably unpopular opinion but Kyla Ross..... she was a very dominant and consistent junior and senior and has remained consistent through her gymnastics career in college, Her consistency and success through the years is very valuable in my opinion and shows how good she is for being so dominant for more than 10 years!"
101,2020-01-24 02:45:19,et350m,"The widespread consensus is this:

1) Simone Biles

2) Shannon Miller

3) Nastia or Aly

4) Nastia or Aly

Who gets the 5th spot is where things get complicated."
102,2020-01-24 06:44:40,et350m,I just want the answer to be Aly. So Aly haha
103,2020-01-24 12:57:17,et350m,"I know this is unpopular, and I’ll probably be downvoted, but if we’re just talking gymnastics, Aly should not be in the running for 2nd best; her form on most skills were all over the place."
104,2020-01-24 11:15:02,et350m,For me it’s fairly clear that it’s Shannon. She competed in 2 quads. She also dominated in what is widely recognized as one of the closest quads of all time. Meaning gymnasts we’re separated by a hair.
105,2020-01-24 23:41:03,et350m,I think we have to take team medals out if we’re talking about the best individual athletes. You’re not a better individual athlete just because you competed in a better US squad.
106,2020-01-24 23:44:19,et350m,Shannon Miller no contest.
107,2020-01-24 04:30:30,et350m,"No mention of Carly Patterson? Short career but Olympic AA gold, Team and BB silver, and World AA silver, Team gold. Also Dominique Dawes. Yeah she doesn’t have the medal count, but she was very unlucky and went to 3 Olympics."

109,2020-01-24 04:34:11,et350m,1. Simone 2. Shannon 3. Gabby
110,2020-01-24 07:10:08,et350m,"You’re on point when it comes to medals, but when you think about it, US gymnasts come and go so fast. Of course there are exceptions, but most US gymnasts have short spurts of success. It seems like as soon as I have a new favorite, she retires!"
111,2020-01-25 12:40:36,et350m,I could make a case for Amy Chow...
112,2020-01-24 08:37:32,et350m,Concede? Best ***US*** gymnast? **Simone Biles is the best gymnast of all time.** Period.
113,2020-01-24 04:51:48,et350m,"For me, Jade Carey is the 2nd best American gymnast behind Simone Biles. One of the best vaulters of all time and some of the most difficult tumbling ever done by a female gymnast. Triple double? That's unprecedented for a woman to be able to pull of, which she will undoubtedly compete this year.

My top 5 are:

1. Simone Biles
2. Jade Carey
3. MyKayla Skinner
4. McKayla Maroney
5. Nastia Liukin / Shawn Johnson

Keep in mind I'm basing this on skill level as opposed to medals, just because it's expected that over time, the quality of gymnastics has improved tremendously. So you have a whole modern era of gymnasts who are extremely talented but are only competing for a few medals. 

Age is also a factor that affects medal counts (i.e. Shawn and McKayla had extremely short careers)."
114,2020-01-24 03:18:06,et350m,"Had Memmel had an injury free career, or even just roughly the same injuries as all the others, she probably would have been a cinch for #2 American all time.  The unluckiest gymnast ever.   I also loved her since she constantly came up and threatened, outshone, or beat Marta's pets, and you know Marta just hated that."
115,2020-01-24 04:13:17,et350m,"I just didn't think her credentials were enough for inclusion, but since I have a long list yeah I might as well add her I guess."
116,2020-01-24 03:13:21,et350m,"I dislike MLR immensely but there is little doubting she and the others of that generation were trailblazers for future American success.   That cant' be ignored or downplayed.   Cathy Rigby, the first American to win a world medal also deserves recognition there."

In his defense, he was indeed named to the 1980 team. He also won a world gold in 1979, so he definitely had a legit shot at success in '80 were it not for the boycott.

Jade and MyKayla's triple doubles look really well-executed, great landings and good form. MyKayla's double double laid out is very close to being fully laid out, and Jade Carey's is pretty much laid out.

Compare that to Nastia and Shawn's tumbling: Shawn always takes large steps on her landings on tumbles such as the full twisting double tuck, something that Jade and MyKayla do in **combination** and land solidly. As well, Nastia doesn't have good twisting form, but MyKayla's twisting form on her triple twist is a lot better.

I think MyKayla's dance is fine, she's not graceful by any means but it's artistic. In fact, I **love** her style on floor, it's pretty entertaining to watch. Jade's style is pretty lackluster but it doesn't affect the performance for me because of the tumbling. And there's nothing graceful about vault in my opinion."

I guess I'm trying to say that if Jade were from any other era, she would be considered one of the best American gymnasts ever, and because you can't control the era you're born in, I'm trying to compare these gymnast's skills levels **regardless** of who they were competing against.

The judging was extremely corrupt in the 90’s, and despite how good Shannon was, she did benefit from wearing the American leotard. She was insanely good, but put her in a Bulgarian leotard and I don’t think she gets above 9.85 on floor in 1992 with the big step on the double pike, or wins the AA with that big error on floor in 1994.

She might not even make my personal top 10 in fact, including being behind some people who would not make the discussion for this.

Not really.   She faced the Soviets at the 91 worlds and lost.  She faced them again at the 92 Olympics and lost.  Soviets won the Team Gold, Gutsu beat her for the AA gold, and Lysenko also beat her out for the individual gold Miller did not win at those Games.   She finally triumphed at the 93 worlds when the Soviet Union was officialy no more (in the process of being disabandoned already in 92).

The closest to ever doing that was Zmeskal, but her home cooked win in Indy was one of the biggest controversies ever if I recall.   She did quiet a lot of her critics by winning 2 golds at the 92 event worlds though."

How many Americans in this day and age could ever do the AA that many times before finally medaling?   Good grief, even Jana Bieger medaled the only time she did AA at worlds.

Her bars is godawful, for that alone she isn't a total true All Around gymnast for me.  And she is largely a floor specialist."

Valid point.  It is more that she so rarely got an AA medal as an American gymnast competing in the AA which is pretty bad in todays era of a very weak global AA field and how seemingly easy it is for American women to medal in the AA.  

>Also, if you were to take Aly’s bars and give them to anyone from a country that isn’t the US, GB, China, or Russia then they’d kill for her set. It wasn’t great but the highest of standards but I guarantee Brazil or Netherlands or Switzerland or any other bubble country would take it.

It is possible but hard to say.  Lets face it, if she were from any other country, especialy a non elite country, she would be absolutely massacred on E scores for her bars, and that might no longer be the case.

Also if she were from any of those countries her training would be totally different, and an event like bars where she has almost no talent for, her routine would be significantly worse than it is even is now.

>To your last point, almost all big name gymnasts have benefited or been affected by questionable scoring at some point or another. 

Maybe but Aly's scores are questioned much more regularly than nearly everyone else, and IMO for good reason.  And in general she is just a very sloppy and not clean gymnast which stands out poorly in comparision to other U.S greats.   If she had competed in the era of compulsories I would be willing to bet money she never makes a single U.S world or Olympic team, even in the late 80s when the U.S were nowhere in the sport."

93 and beyond can't be called Soviets anymore.   And anyway when we get down to it once Lilia and Khorkina entered their prime beginning in 95 Miller was not competitive with them anymore, atleast not in the AA.  Miller herself was probably past her prime by then, so we will never really know, it is speculation.  93 and 94 did not have any great ex Soviets unless you consider people like Kochetkova and Fabrichnova as fitting that which would be a stretch.

Don't get me wrong though, I still rank Miller well above Zmeskal of course.   IMO Zmeskal was one of the most overrated gymnasts I ever saw, and her 91 world AA title still baffles the heck out of me, while I probably would have had Miller winning the 92 AA (although a much closer call then Zmeskal not winning in 91 which is a for sure for me).   But technically speaking I find she fits that even more than Miller.  The results are the results whether I agree with them or not and Zmeskal took down the true Soviet hierarchy and great ex Soviets more often than Miller did."
168,2020-01-24 04:09:57,et350m,"First off you have to again consider context.  This is the era it is super easy, or should be super easy for any top American to medal in the AA.   It is very rare (except for Aly apparently) for an American to make the AA and not medal.  Since 2005, the Americans have had 23 of 30 entries medal in the AA of Olympics and Worlds.  Excluding Aly who is 1 for 4, it is 22 out of 26.  Keep in mind we are currently in the era of the worst AA fields in history.  Nina Derwael who is just terrible on both floor and vault (would be weak by 80s standards), and mediocre on beam, very nearly medaled in the AA at the last 2 worlds, was about one more solid landing from it both times.  That says it all.

I am comparing her to other great Americans.  Relative to them she largely stands out as a floor specialist, even though she was good on vault and beam.  And has a terrible bars set, not befitting a top AA gymnast.

I would never put her as high as 3rd or 4th best American of all time.   I understand why some others do, but I never will.   The fact there is not even one time she could be considered to be in remote possible contention to win the All Around when she competes All Around, is something else that solidifies that for me.  There isn't one event you can point to and say ""Aly was a possible contender for the AA gold"".   Not even 2016 when she was 2nd to Simone."

170,2020-01-24 03:44:37,et350m,"The 1992 Worlds really shouldn't be brought up in this context. It's a competition that we should award medals on a technicality, but it was a really abnormal competition that is incomparable to other Worlds.

1) It had a weird format that specifically gave preference to the defending champs (Zmeskal).

2) It didn't even have an AA which is how gymnasts, especially Cold War era gymnasts are compared.

3) It was all EF which means country limits. So ""going against the Soviets"" means going against 1 or 2 Soviets. I only count 3 different Soviets in the entire EF field.

4) It's essentially double dipping. In any other context Worlds means, ""best of the year."" There was an Olympics that year.

> 93 and beyond can't be called Soviets anymore.

Would you settle for Soviet trained? The talent selection process was still there. The well coaches juniors that had grown up in a gym from the age of 6 was still there. It's not merely a coincidence that Khorkina/Lilia were really good gymnasts.

> 93 and 94 did not have any great ex Soviets unless you consider people like Kochetkova and Fabrichnova as fitting that which would be a stretch.

At the 1993 AA there were 4 ex-soviets in the top 7. Both the 1993 and 1994 AA witnessed an AA medal go to an ex-Soviet. But it should be stressed, my comment about Miller was based mostly on 1992. That's what I consider to be the most incredible."

As she did not win any events gold at the 91 worlds.   Are you are right on the double dipping, but that was one of my points against Miller in general, she got to compete in the period 91-96 where there were more worlds/Olympics available to the gymnasts than any other time frame in history.   That she missed 2 of the 9 (yes 9 in 5 years, lol) is immaterial, as injuries are part of a gymnasts career.

I don't know if you watched the 93 worlds or not but until 2005 it was generally regarded as the weakest worlds in history.   Gogean missed winning the AA by 0.007 with a 9.9 start value on both beam and floor, weak bars, and 9.8 start value on vault.    Miller won with a major 2-3 tenth dismount mistake on beam and a 9.8 start value on vault.   Dawes who had atrocious form this year and was still just emerging, would have won the AA without her fall on vault.   Yes 4 of the top 7 at the 93 worlds were ex Soviets but who were they.   A past her prime Lysenko who was a shadow of the gymnast she was in 90-92 winning the bronze.  Also making the same stupid mistakes she always made in AAs that prevented her from possibly winning times like the 92 Olympics, but getting a much higher result which speaks to the poor field.   Fabrichnova who is hardly a standout.  Galieva who was visibly weaker than she was in either 92 or 96, neither which she was even a real elite.   And lastly a young Piskun.   Hardly an example of a string of high quality classic ex Soviets IMO.  94 you had Kochetkova with the bronze, a young Podkopayeva 6th, and a young Khorkina 9th, so this is a bit better.   Still it is nothing like taking down the Soviets in 88, or even what Miller and Zmeskal were facing in 91 and 92."

It's not about her being better than them or not, but that she was the only one who could truly be their equal. What American did that at the Olympics.

In regards to Lysenko, Roza, Bogi, Fabi, young Lilia, and Piskun. They were still a great class who were capable of beating most of what the USA could muster. Miller and Dawes could compete, but most of the Americans couldn't."

Really Miller (maybe Retton but it is clear how you feel about her) is the only  U.S gymnast in the Soviet days of say 55-95 that is a top 10 U.S gymnast ever, so it makes sense she would be the only one to face or triumph vs the Soviets.   The other best U.S gymnasts ever didn't even have the opportunity."
179,2020-01-28 00:28:04,et350m,"I wouldn’t include MLR because of the 1984 Olympic boycott - she never went toe-to-toe with the Soviets / GDR. If Mostepanova, Yurchenko, Ricna, Gnauck, Shushunova and friends were all competing against her in the AA, she’d have been lucky to get 8th."
180,2020-01-28 14:19:31,et350m,She beat Szabo who was one of the big favorites even in a full field.  So I highly doubt she would be as low as 8th.

189,2020-03-27 17:00:54,fq00jo,Hi Everybody! It's Nancy. What Tokyo Olympics-related questions can I answer for you?
190,2020-03-27 17:20:45,fq00jo,"Hi Nancy!

Do you think the Olympic committee will offer refunds for tickets?"
191,2020-03-27 17:21:56,fq00jo,"Have you heard anything from teams that already struggle financially to get to the Games--like synchronized swimming--about how the postponement will affect their ability to head back to Tokyo? Is it possible the extra time could help?   


ALSO: What's your favorite place to go running when you're on the road reporting? Any favorite route in that city or location?"
192,2020-03-27 18:10:35,fq00jo,OK everyone. Thanks to those who came by!  Stay safe and keep washing your hands!   And please keep following our coverage of the Olympics at usatoday.com/sports/olympics.
193,2020-03-27 18:27:17,fq00jo,"What are your biggest tips for reporters just getting started? I’ve been reporting on international sports for a year now, but I still feel like I have a lot to learn."
194,2020-03-29 18:46:26,fq00jo,"Do we know when the next Olympics after that will be? As in if Tokyo happens in 2021, will the next ones be in 2024 or four years after the last, in 2025?"
195,2020-03-29 22:48:47,fq00jo,"what happens to the athletes that have qualified for  the 2020 Olympics? Will these athletes have to re-compete again next year with a re-do Olympic Trials? Or since they got their ticket this year at they're respective Trials, are they automatically still going next summer?"
196,2020-03-29 17:06:00,fq00jo,"Hi Nancy! 
Hope you are found good. 
When did they got postponed to? 
Who actually gets a say in making the decision?"
197,2020-03-27 17:27:11,fq00jo,"Great question. We've seen some conflicting reports on that, so I don't have a definitive answer. But the IOC is aware people are questioning -- and won't be happy if they say no refunds."
198,2020-03-27 17:33:35,fq00jo,"Most Olympic athletes have to be creative with their finances in order to keep training, and this is likely to make it tougher. Yes, they have more time to qualify if they need to. But it's another year of training, possibly competitions, that they haven't budgeted for. I think they'll get some help from their national governing bodies and Olympic committees, but those organizations aren't getting the money they expected this year, either. A couple of athletes I talked to mentioned the financial considerations, but I think the short postponement probably makes it a bit easier. If it was a two-year delay, I think the calculation would be much different for some athletes. 

As for running, ooh, tough question! Overseas, London. I usually run through Hyde Park and Green Park to the Palace then through St. James Park to the Embankment. Domestically, St. Louis, Boston and the Twin Cities. LOVE LOVE LOVE Forest Park in St. Louis, and I always run along the Charles in Boston. In the Cities, either around the lakes or head over to the U and run by the river. (Can you see a theme developing? I love running by water.)"
199,2020-03-27 18:47:20,fq00jo,"Read. A lot. Whether it's writers you like or the sports you are/want to be covering, the more knowledge you have the better. Work your contacts. Find sports that are lacking in coverage and see if you could fill the need. Most of all, be curious!"
200,2020-03-27 17:32:47,fq00jo,Thank you!

237,2020-03-17 19:33:48,fjy5fj,"Nah, this is giving too much credit to someone (Shannon) that isn't Khorkina herself lol."
238,2020-03-16 22:22:02,fjpppi,This is all mars territory. Look at where mars is and it’s aspects. I was good in sports (Nationals in track) and have sun conjunct mars + mars in 7th which made me competitive towards others + mars in Pisces (which rules feet) which made me fast on my feet. If I would look anywhere else besides mars it would probably be 5th house because that rules sports I believe.
239,2020-03-16 23:02:43,fjpppi,"Concur with the first commenter, look for mars instead of the MC if you’re looking for physical ability, that and aspects to mars or the ascendant or any planets in the first house. Potentially the sixth house as well.

I’m freakishly athletic, have done a huge range of different sports from karate, swimming, tennis, track, crossfit/Olympic style weightlifting etc at different points in my life. Currently I’ve been on a yoga kick, and the body awareness has led me to discover how flexible my hips and ~genital~ area are. I have a stellium in my Scorpio first house, including a sun/mars conjunction, which is also conjunct my ascendant to a lesser degree, and squared by a 10th house Jupiter. My hypothesis is the Scorpio ruling that area of my body gives it the potential for great strength and flexibility. 

Sixth house could also be a place for athletic ability, or at least the patience to work hard at perfecting a craft of some kind, particularly physically related."
240,2020-03-17 16:34:45,fjpppi,"Thank you both so much!!! Her Sun is Aries, so Mars-ruled (she’s one of the two most competitive people I’ve ever encountered btw). Her Mars is in second house conjunct (4degree orb) Neptune in Aquarius. 

These two are opposite her Saturn and are one of the two oppositions that interact with her Grand Trine — the oppositions are opposite two of the three trine “points” (I’m sure there’s a name for this — are these t-squares?) 

... it’s been awhile since I focused on astrology but I got into it at her age and thought it would make a nice gift. 

As for aspects to her AC, as I mentioned, she’s got Pluto 😳 conjunct her AC — as does Simone Biles btw, and as does her father (my brother) ... isn’t it interesting how family members’ charts so often have many contacts? I haven’t seen many Pluto-conjunct-AC natal charts. 

Her Mars is exactly trine her MC, btw. Sextile her Pluto-AC conjunction.

No planets in her 1st house (except for Pluto on her AC); none in sixth house. She does have Venus exactly on her fifth house cusp, in Taurus.

She does have considerable patience and drive, despite the empty 6th house (Mercury-ruled). 

Grand trine is Saturn Jupiter Sun in Fire.

Again, thank you both so much for your incredibly helpful insight: really really appreciated 🤗"

248,2020-03-18 01:54:43,fjao61,Ugh yes!!! What happened to her is horrible I’m so happy she’s using her platform to call them out on their BS
249,2020-03-16 00:55:48,fjao07,Can someone explain the context?
250,2020-03-16 00:39:38,fjao07,she’s such a boss
251,2020-03-16 02:15:16,fjao07,Every time I read something like this I stop and put out love and vibes for our sisters speaking truth to power.  Thank you sisters.
252,2020-03-16 05:19:22,fjao07,Did they tag the wrong person???
253,2020-03-16 11:43:24,fjao07,Roasted
254,2020-03-16 00:58:23,fjao07,USA Gymnastics ignored reports from athletes of molestation by the agency's doctors and such. It went on for ages. A few years ago some gymnasts started coming forward about it. The agency has done little to investigate and likes to deny shit happened.
255,2020-03-16 05:24:38,fjao07,Lol it looks like they did. Maybe they knew they'd get roasted.
256,2020-03-16 07:22:59,fjao07,I'm thinking maybe they copy/pasted from the post they made on Instagram since that's her account name over there
257,2020-03-16 01:01:24,fjao07,"Oh, ok. I was aware of this (the coach was the worst?) But didn't put 2 and 2 together. Thanks =)"
258,2020-03-16 05:31:51,fjao07,"On the one hand, it’s hilarious.

On the other hand, it makes me think whoever runs their social media account is so incompetent they won’t see her response."
259,2020-03-16 03:41:31,fjao07,"Actually, it was a team doctor, Larry Nassar, who was the worst, not a coach. He's been convicted on a few different counts involving molesting a horrific number of athletes. As /u/April_Budgate said, USA Gymnastics (including leaders in the organization and coaches) have been accused of covering it up and there's been no real investigation done."
260,2020-03-16 14:27:55,fjao07,"There were also a lot of reports of one of the national team coaches, Bela Karolyi, also being abusive, going back to the 90s. (It's possible gymnastics accused Marta of abuse, too, but I don't remember that off the top of my head.) That's why he retired earlier than Marta.

And while he doesn't seem to have physically abused any Team USA members, the environment he created at the ranch where the team trains allowed Nassar to groom the gymnasts. I saw at least a few gymnasts talking during the hearings talking about how Nassar gained their trust by sneaking them food against Bela's rules, and parents weren't allowed at the ranch, so the gymnasts didn't have anyone they trusted to turn to."
261,2020-03-15 17:56:13,fj5cop,Saw this on Simone’s insta story for her birthday yesterday. I love gymnastics and DM so this was the weirdest collision of interests. Does anyone know how they met?
262,2020-03-15 18:29:55,fj5cop,Who here follows r/gymnastics as well as r/dancemoms. Cuz I certainly do!!!
263,2020-03-15 20:27:31,fj5cop,2 amazing talents!!
264,2020-03-17 17:49:47,fj5cop,She’s commented on Paige’s Instagram before too.
265,2020-03-15 20:08:19,fj5cop,Rolês aleatórios
266,2020-03-15 19:15:45,fj5cop,I wanna assume some Teen Choice/Kids choice/etc award shows. I'm sure they'd both heard of each other and just met at one of those. Just a guess
267,2020-03-15 19:36:12,fj5cop,Me too!!!
268,2020-03-15 20:23:47,fj5cop,Me!
269,2020-03-15 20:50:18,fj5cop,Me! I've seen you around there actually.
270,2020-03-15 23:50:15,fj5cop,I feel like it’s probably a pretty big crossover!
271,2020-03-19 04:47:01,fj5cop,And Maddie’s. They’re also good friends and Maddie did a vid talking about Simone and her accomplishments for some documentary-type thing!
272,2020-03-15 21:40:20,fj5cop,"Haha cool, do you remember me saying anything in particular?"
273,2020-03-15 22:02:04,fj5cop,I don't remember what it was but a while ago I saw a couple quite insightful comments and realised it was you. lol.

320,2020-04-16 21:34:40,g2k9cj,That's true. Simone needs to work on the toe dexterity and strength if she's ever gonna have a future though
321,2020-04-16 12:04:59,g2de12,"She would possibly be disqualified form round 1 since she doesn't know the rules. Apart from that it completely depends on the level of your JJ training. Was this serious training with regular sparing and then competing in actual competitions or was it more like kid stuff?

Edit: Just realised that 2 and 3rd grade is when you are 5 and 6 years old right? So I don't think that counts for anything. I think she might have you on this. Her body would be stronger and more dexterous than yours and at 17 I wouldn't imagine you have much knockout power behind your punches. I think she would beat you since she is a professional athlete."
322,2020-04-16 14:13:01,g2de12,[deleted]
323,2020-04-16 12:46:54,g2de12,"Out of all the people you could put yourself against you choose a 4’8 woman.

And your combat training means very little if you were in the 2nd/3rd grade. Unclear whether Biles has any combat training. So it’s basically equal. She’s gonna be faster and a whole lot more flexible, and her legs are hella strong and will pick some serious power. Which I think would be enough to take you down. Now you are almost a foot taller do you could use your superior reach  to your advantage. But overall my vote goes to Simone Biles."
324,2020-04-16 14:55:24,g2de12,"let's be honest here, sure you might have taken jujitsu classes in 2nd or 3rd grade, but unless you continued those classes through at least 6th grade or practiced vigorously every day, you're not really going to be any better at fighting than any other fit 17 y / o male. Simone biles has insane flexibility and agility. 

In a boxing, wrestling, or sparring match, I think you would have some difficulties, but you would definitely come out on top. You would likely be evenly matched in a UFC fight, so I can't really say who'd win. I think a death battle would be too intense to be decisive."
325,2020-04-24 08:19:19,g2de12,I mean m8 I’m not sure if this is to wank your ego but yeah you’re beating a 5 ft woman in a fight a pretty dumb post ngl.
326,2020-04-16 12:39:40,g2de12,Yeah the jiu-jitsu thing was a joke but I'm still like 40 cm taller then her
327,2020-04-16 14:57:20,g2de12,Maybe a kink or a sexism thing?  Can’t see any other reason why he’d fight a child sized woman
328,2020-04-16 12:46:21,g2de12,You are significantly heavier than her too so I'm not sure
329,2020-04-16 16:22:13,g2de12,Because it’s a pretty fair fight. Average teenager vs Child sized Olympian.

344,2020-04-15 02:36:11,g1il9i,Absolutely. No one came close to matching her last quad and still no one has this quad. She has nothing left to prove. Another Olympics would just be icing on the cake.
345,2020-04-15 04:15:47,g1il9i,Simone is 100% the GOAT. She hasn’t lost a FX or AA competition in 7 years and has medalled in every event except bars in every World Championship and at the Olympic Games. Simone has a World or Olympic medal on every event and skills named for her on 3 events. Three of her skills have never been done by anyone else in competition. Simone would have been the GOAT if she retired after Rio and she didn’t - she came back and got even better. 7 years (6 I suppose since she took a year off) at the top of gymnastics is unbelievably impressive.  Simone has also done this under the open ended code and pushed the boundaries of the sport to the point where we may never see anyone else do some of the skills she has competed.
346,2020-04-15 04:05:05,g1il9i,"I'd have considered her the GOAT had Tokyo been on scheduled and she retired right before it. Among her many unparalleled records, she has medaled on beam in every EF from 2013 Nationals to now, something no other gymnastics great can claim to do during their period of dominance: not Nadia, not Latynina, not Khorkina, not Shushunova, etc. In fact, pretty much the only way for Simone to even possibly break this streak is to continue to Tokyo. :D So either way, GOAT!"
347,2020-04-15 04:21:37,g1il9i,She's been the goat since 2015 lol
348,2020-04-15 07:56:53,g1il9i,Goat no matter what. We expected her to dominate were she to be able to. She has the hardest WAG vault. She has the most medals of any WAG. I think she is already the top
349,2020-04-15 03:00:55,g1il9i,Yes
350,2020-04-15 03:18:49,g1il9i,No question about it
351,2020-04-15 06:27:19,g1il9i,Absolutely 100% yes. Another way to think about it is who else would be the GOAT if not her? I certainly can't think of anyone who even comes close
352,2020-04-15 04:24:15,g1il9i,Yes

355,2020-04-19 18:04:06,g1il9i,"100%.  Perhaps more so.  I'll respect the hell out of her either way, and I'd love to see her compete in Tokyo.  But, if she chooses not to, to me that just shows that she knows competing there isn't the end all be all of her career.  She can recognize her accomplishments and be happy with what she has done in (and to change) the sport, without bowing down to USAG and competing for them one last time.  On the same token, I think if she does choose to compete, it will be for herself and NOT for USAG."
356,2020-04-15 23:27:05,g1il9i,"I thought after 2019 worlds that she became the most decorated gymnast (MAG+WAG), not just WAG."
357,2020-04-18 19:54:39,g1il9i,"I thought she was a few medals behind the MAG record, but I googled it and I was wrong! It is so crazy impressive as they have an extra two medal potential in MAG per competition, she still managed to crush it. That was a happy thing to find out today :)"

372,2020-04-12 19:15:55,g02ff3,I think the challenge for those of us with arms would be to keep a handstand in the first place

383,2020-04-12 15:00:42,fzxu1u,Maybe Trinity Thomas??
384,2020-04-12 20:20:46,fzxu1u,Laurie Hernandez? Probably not.  But I’d be thrilled if Chelsie Memmel was there!
385,2020-04-12 17:05:18,fzxu1u,I think Sydney Barros- if TD can keep her in one piece- has a great chance of being there. I don’t think Mya Witte will be at trials though- she is amazing on beam but needs more time on the other events
386,2020-04-12 17:10:19,fzxu1u,I'm hoping Faith torrez gets to compete.
387,2020-04-16 20:08:44,fzxu1u,"Ok so I'm not 100% caught up on my watching, working on it now in quarantine, but what about Ragan Smith? Her floor routine at the 2016 trials was my absolute favorite. Did she retire?"
388,2020-04-12 22:44:05,fzxu1u,Aleah Finnegan? She posted on her instagram that now that the Olympic has been postponed she has a chance to came back from her injure and be ready to try to make the team.
389,2020-04-17 02:18:28,fzxu1u,"I would love to see Sydney Morris and/or Love Birt. I know Love was invited to a pretty recent senior camp, and Sydney shows fantastic potential. Three FSG girls head-to-head would be a lot but they’re all fantastic gymnasts capable of putting up a good fight."
390,2020-04-13 04:04:19,fzxu1u,Didn't Jordan already defer a year for UCLA? Do you think she's going to defer ANOTHER year or do college and elite at the same time or just go to college?
391,2020-04-12 17:39:58,fzxu1u,"True, I wonder if she has the motivation to stay training elite because all the collegiate gymnasts will probably have enough of a challenge getting ready for the next NCAA season (if it happens)."
392,2020-04-12 20:25:07,fzxu1u,"Omg I totally forgot both of them, honestly I think the chance that one of them is there is >50%"
393,2020-04-12 17:18:54,fzxu1u,That's why I didn't put Sydney Barros or my fave Emma Malabuyo :(. Mya Witte was my darkhorse pick (along with Karis German) because everything seems easy for her so I figured she can upgrade safely.
394,2020-04-12 17:19:35,fzxu1u,How awesome would it be to see her and Emily Lee both there after missing the beginning of the quad! I am thinking they have a chance of heading off to college though.
395,2020-04-17 02:14:18,fzxu1u,"Texas Nightmares, very unfortunately, did a number on Ragan. She was the 2017 nat’l AA champion, and was the favorite for 2017 worlds AA, but a pretty severe ankle injury just before AA finals started took her out. 

Ragan is one of my absolute favorite gymnasts of all-time; there’s a personality to her gymnastics that I simply love to watch. She attempted a 2018 comeback and was chosen as an alternate in Doha, but ultimately chose to attend OU and start competing in NCAA earlier than planned (originally was set to enroll after Tokyo). It broke my heart to watch her elite goals crumble while she basically limped into college. But, she seems to be doing really well at OU, and from what I know, it sounds like she’s happy there which is all that matters. 

I’m just ranting now, but this is the best example I can think of re: TD’s TERRIBLE pacing. Had Ragan had surgery immediately after her ‘17 injury and followed a sensible and patient recovery regimen, I’d bet that she would still be a major contender for Tokyo. In the year after an Olympics (keep in mind Ragan was only 16 when she was a Rio alternate), there was absolutely no need to rush her re-entry."
396,2020-04-12 23:26:31,fzxu1u,"Definitely a contender! I could see her staying around and waiting for college but also the field is so deep at this point that I imagine some contenders won't make it to trials. I put 17 gymnasts + Carey, while at trials in 2012 and 2016 they only had 15. I also only put three gymnasts each from 2020 and 2021. I left off Trinity Thomas, Emily Lee, Faith Torrez, Emma Malabuyo, Laurie Hernandez, Chellsie Memmel, and other potential 2004 and 2005 new seniors including Ciena Alipio, Sydney Barros, Sophia Butler, Sydney Morris, Anya Pilgrim, and éMjae Frazier in addition to Aleah Finnegan, because we just have way too much talent right now! I'm sure I'll miss some people though :)"
397,2020-04-18 00:35:55,fzxu1u,"Sydney seems to be on a 2024 trajectory to me tbh. Wouldn’t be surprised to see her and Kayla DiCello, and Alipio all try to stick it out, especially if Konnor or Skye make the team"
398,2020-04-13 04:56:36,fzxu1u,I think she could do it at the same time or defer again like Jade did it like how Morgan is defeating a second year. I just don’t think she would have moved across the country to WCC if she wasn’t serious about going as far as she can in elite
399,2020-04-13 04:04:45,fzxu1u,Also is anyone else in this situation?
400,2020-04-12 21:51:29,fzxu1u,"Well, Laurie Hernandez seems to be in an interesting spot. Nobody knows how real was her comeback in 2020, but if she is given entire another year to prepare, then either she goes for it, or she steps back and this would be very suspicious (regardless of her actual intentions). I think now everything is up to her, she has time, she has past Olympic experience, she definitely has the skill and can ba a valuable AA team member, so it would be great if she decides to go for it, especially that she was, and she definitely would be very entertaining to watch.

For Chellsie it is a ery different story - i remember how in 2012 she was basically denied to get even a chance at participate in US Nationals (which was very weird, considering that before her shoulder injury, she was in a 2011 national team, and the reasoning was that she ""wasnt in Worlds team"", and she also ""had a questionable performace"" at 2012 US Classic). since then, a lot has changed in US gymnastics, and many people believe that it is for a better (it is hard to disagree, really), but it is also quite easy to forget that situation was very different - in 2012 it was all about going back to get a team gold, while now it is like: we know US gets gold, so it is more about chosing the gymnasts who will bring it back to home (and this makes changes much easier for organization, as they know that regardless of what is happening with organization, a lot of gold will be won).  Rules for Olympic team also changed, with these two specialist spots Chellsie is defintely capable to get one of them (BB, possibly UB), considering what she already shows from her  (we don't really hae any idea how serious) training. She spends a lot of time in the gym, she seems to be healthy and passionate, she knows that the biggest obstacles for her are no more on her way, she also knows, and ii was always known, that she was very unique gymnast, so maybe she also doesnt care that much about her age: if she is in shape, if she gets back her most critical skills (lately showing some double piked beam dismount into pit), then she has a lot of experience and character to give it a go. Ok, maybe I'm overenthusiastic here, but I would be extremely happy to see her back on US Gymnastic stage, even if she doesn't make it to the Olympic (because to be honest - the competition can be really tough)."
401,2020-04-12 18:18:32,fzxu1u,"Emma is my absolute fave, I so wish she would make it 😩 I feel like Mya could be a huge factor in 2024"
402,2020-04-12 17:21:57,fzxu1u,"True, not sure why I didn't think of them as two of the ones more likely to go ahead for college, but true.  I'd love to see Faith be competitive - she really impressed me last year and I was excited to see her again this year.  Where are her and Emily committed to for college?"
403,2020-04-17 22:38:36,fzxu1u,"I think that’s bad injury management, which is a problem Texas Dreams gymnasts have due to the conditioning and technique, but I honestly don’t think Kim paced Ragan badly in terms of routines and skill management. I mean, Ragan wasn’t injured from any dangerous skill or from a routine she didn’t have stamina for, she was literally just injured running down the vault runway, and was planning on doing a DTY that at the time was quite comfortable for her. Kim also worked to get Ragan’s start values high on bars, beam, and floor without very dangerous elements. They took out the Patterson and they fixed the double Arabian technique on floor. The only skill I think may have been unwise was the double layout and the split leap 1.5 on floor which were always low."
404,2020-04-17 02:22:01,fzxu1u,"It just makes me sad. I've never done gymnastics, always wanted to but money, but I've always lived vicariously. Just watching Ragan during the championships and seeing her Instagram..I'd just love to see her at the Olympics."
405,2020-04-13 05:02:54,fzxu1u,"I think just Jade, Morgan, and Riley? The 2018 seniors like Grace, Kara, Shilese, and Emma would have started this fall (Maile went a year early) so they would only have to defer one year"
406,2020-04-12 23:12:42,fzxu1u,"The two issues I see with Chellsie and to a lesser extent Laurie competing at trials: 

1) Tom LOOOVES AA - for example, Sunisa Lee only did bars/beam at US Classic 2019, and although she medaled on bars while Leanne Wong medaled on neither bars nor beam, Tom took Leanne to Pan Ams as a bars/beam specialist over Sunisa. If Chellsie and Laurie do not present competitive AA programs they may not even be invited to trials from nationals.

2) Kara Eaker and Konnor McClain - Simone winning the world beam title in dominant fashion last year means there is really only one potential spot for a beam specialist (i.e. they will not have a beam specialist AAer like McClain on the team as WELL as an individual), and i.d.k if Tom will invite Chellsie and Laurie to trials if Kara and Konnor already qualify through a high AA placement at nationals. On the other hand, Chellsie and Laurie are both former Olympians so if it were up to me as long as they have at least one competitive routine (like Nastia 2012 on beam) they should be invited to Trials."
407,2020-04-18 00:32:45,fzxu1u,"Consider a team of Simone, Suni, Riley, and Emma w/ specialist Konnor...literally the top 10 on beam in qualifications would be just USA and China and maybe Flavia..."
408,2020-04-12 17:25:42,fzxu1u,Emily is committed at UCLA and Faith is at OU according to their insta bios
409,2020-04-18 18:28:53,fzxu1u,"Fair points! In terms of difficulty I agree that she was paced just fine. I suppose what I'm trying to describe (realizing now I was a little unclear in my first comment- sorry about that!) is a mix of pacing/injury management. Ramping back up to her full difficulty so quickly after '17 Worlds was, imo, what ended her elite contention. Continuing to crank out the skills she was competing in 2018 on an ankle that was still causing her excruciating pain is mainly what motivates my point that her recovery was poorly paced. And yeah, I always wince at her DLO's–she is one tough cookie."
410,2020-04-13 07:31:22,fzxu1u,"Under past USAG administrations, Laurie would absolutely get an invite to trials with two decent events, simply because I think that her draw for marketing purposes would be significant. I think that's ~probably~ still the case now - USAG still has to make money, and Laurie is one of the most recognizable names to casual fans."
411,2020-04-12 17:38:28,fzxu1u,Gotcha.  Thanks! They will be so fun to watch.

However, none of us are in a great place right now, and that includes Simone with the uncertainty, inability to see her Mom... The reported break-up surely doesn't help. (It can mean she's living alone at a time when you can't go out.)

I hope she finds all the mental support and strength she needs, and can come back to the sport and enjoy herself while doing it. But if she's happier in a different scenario, then that's what I want for her."
450,2020-04-07 19:23:37,fwmimy,"I really don't like the idea of a Biles v. McClain rivalry. There's just no point and nothing to gain, from seeing two great athletes/friends pitted against each other. Team USA was a mess in 2017 from the Nassar scandal, and the lack of returning athletes. While some gymnasts may retire, including Simone, the sport and spirit will live on. 

Personally if 2005 babies are included in the Olympics, years of pacing will be ruined, and some might not even attend."
451,2020-04-07 22:46:05,fwmimy,"i think a team of melnikova, urazova, listunova, and gerasimova could give a team without simone a run for their money"
452,2020-04-08 01:06:53,fwmimy,"If the team was Carey/Lee/McCusker/Blakely with specialists McClain and Skinner I think USA would be just as dominant.

TF: I think they beat a Russian team with Listunova based on Carey's presence on VT/FX.

AA: Lee, McCusker, and Blakely are all favorites for medals and Lee especially is a favorite to win.

VT: Carey is a co-favorite for gold with Ellie Downie and Yeo Seojeong, Skinner could also challenge for a medal.

UB: Lee is a favorite for a medal with Derwael, Fan, and Downie, and McCusker could also challenge for a medal.

BB: McClain is a favorite for a medal, and Lee, McCusker, and Blakely could all challenge.

FX: Carey is the favorite for gold, and Lee, Blakely, and maybe Skinner could challenge for medals also."
453,2020-04-09 03:03:42,fwmimy,She broke up with Stacy??? Where did you hear this?
454,2020-04-07 22:41:15,fwmimy,"Talking about a rivalry with Simone is dumb in general, she's just on another level. I know that sports writers like to talk about rivalries but it's just not realistic. Put a pin in that until Simone retires."
455,2020-04-08 04:39:01,fwmimy,"Honestly I think Konnor would have her work cut out for her to get the 2nd AA spot, let alone challenge Simone... I rewatched all her routines from nationals recently and didn’t see what everyone was flipping out about.

(ETA: she was great, but I saw “top-notch junior” not “second coming of Simone”)."
456,2020-04-08 00:48:58,fwmimy,"That team is still too weak on vault I think. A Lee/Carey/McCusker/McCallum team, for example, would beat them on VT and be very very close together on the other three events (Lee/McCusker/McCallum has the slight edge on UB and Urazova/Listunova/Gerasimova has the slight edge on BB, and Lee/Carey/McCallum vs. Melnikova/Listunova/Urazova is really even imo). If Russia had Akhaimova instead of Gerasimova on the other hand I think they could really challenge."
457,2020-04-08 18:41:34,fwmimy,"It puts everyone back in 2012 (maybe even 2010) territory - if Russia hits AND the US doesn’t, Russia can take it.

If China can put together their top current NT members (including 2021 seniors) without injuries and hit, they could also take it. 

Things would be so much more interesting. Of course if the US doesn’t fall they should be able to take it."
458,2020-04-08 08:23:25,fwmimy,You forgot Memmel!!
459,2020-04-08 18:38:22,fwmimy,"They’d still win if they hit, but I think that team composition (even being optimistic about Blakely and McClain’s senior transitions) is within a fall of silver if Russia or China have a completely clean meet. There’s no more multiple-fall cushion from Simone - they won’t be as dominant even if they would be favorites for gold. And that’s not a super solid team in terms of consistency either - you’ve got plenty of fall risk putting up McCusker and Lee, and Carey has made some fairly large errors throwing her harder skills as well.

Sure, Lee would win the AA if she didn’t fall, but that’s a big if based on her 2019 Worlds performance. As we saw last year, a fall takes her out of the medals, even with other contenders like MJDJS taking themselves out as well."

Look at caitlyn jenner for an example of a typical man who transitioned in adulthood. That's what such a person would come across as. Obvious voice, obvious look, etc.

YES. When listening to the conference video that was a dead give away to my BS-meter. No subtle ""bass"" or anything, clearly female.

476,2020-05-01 14:17:45,gbieil,"That's not to say we can't actually train voice to sound like the opposite sex (training is easier for MtF than FtM, but FtM have natural voice drops on T and end up sounding like a ""squeak toy"" without training). My voice certainly sounds undeniably female despite having got that testosterone hit (being MtF but getting on hormones in adulthood).

Most transitioners, *especially* those who aren't exactly eager to be perfectionists, often slack in this area because it's *hard to do.* Bad training makes them end up whispering and having a sort of raspy voice. And no training just makes them obviously male sounding. If you see someone who looks like a regular woman, except maybe slightly masculine traits; *especially if they're an athlete* then it's probably just a regular woman.

The most obvious tells I've seen are voice as I mentioned, height (it's *rare* for mtf transitioners to be under say 5'5, and are often above 5'9), digit ratio (not super reliable but mtf transitioners who aren't TS often have a male digit ratio), frame (can't do anything about dem shoulders), possibly smaller breast size (hormones may not make them grow fully). And ofc behavior. For *actual* transsexuals as I noted we do have some weird physiology stuff, but for GID patients and medical transitioners without TS they end up having male builds in general.

For FTM they're easy to clock a lot of the time as they're often pretty short (under 5'6), very often have a ""squeak toy"" sound to their voice (this is due to rapid masculinization of voice without any training), and will be a ""small man"" on average. Don't bother looking for a lack of bulge because they get surgery and/or ""pack"" (fake dick prosthetic). Looking for breasts is pointless due to binding or surgery. This also goes for mtf, no point in looking for breast padding (we get actual boobs), or a ""bulge"". Bulges are handled through tucking (can't see it through clothes), surgery, padded clothing, and surgery.

If someone gets on hormone therapy prior to puberty you're basically fucked when it comes to clocking, and you'll just end up relying on behavioral cues. Which then comes down to how good of an actor they are, and whether they've got actual TS. FtMs who overplay it often come across like a chihuahua trying to pick a fight. MtFs overplaying it almost come across as a prostitute or stripper or something, perhaps like a bimbo.

But yeah, voice is usually what clocks people for me. It's so damn noticeable when you know what to look for. Transitioners can fix it, but many don't bother.

But yeah this transvestigation stuff is always so laughable because people don't understand what they're even supposed to be looking for, let alone how transition works."

481,2020-05-01 14:29:04,gbieil,"yeah, people are horribly informed on trans people and transitioning as a whole, *including people who claim to be experts.* It's a bit horrifying, and there *are* a lot of conspiracy stuff tied in with trans issues. But ""every celebrity is secretly trans"" ain't one of them.

Hell, transitioning *isn't even their goal.* They want to push androgyny, which is why they keep pushing this nonbinary stuff. Male and female combined into one. It's some weird occult stuff. It's also why when they do gender-bending stuff they always make it *really obvious.* Drag queens, super androgyny, obvious crossdressing, etc. They want to eradicate clear lines between men and women. Not keep them divided and just have men ""secretly as woman"". Whereas transsexuals like myself are often the reverse of that. I'm pretty feminine on average and think women *should* be feminine. But stuff like feminism pushes against that idea shitting on femininity and pushing women to be more masculine.

They've completely erased and appropriated transsexualism for their agenda of normalizing transvestism and androgyny. It's horrifying. Sex without reproduction, pure androgyny, breakdown of male and female, all in the name of ""supporting trans people"" when in reality they erase trans people, lie about the science behind it all, and then try to start claiming *everyone* is trans. It seems like the long-term goal here is a population reduction within certain countries/demographics; primarily pneumatic races; along with an influx of hylic races and pushing race mixing to distill and erase pneumatic races. Medical transitioners are completely infertile, so it benefits them to push transition onto people, even if it's not good for the person going through it (it's good for transsexuals, not entirely beneficial for GID, and harmful for the general public).

But that's a whole thing in itself. There is *so much* to talk about on this topic, but people just wanna boil it down to hating on ""trannies"" and trying to claim every famous person is trans. And it's just so depressing to watch it all."

483,2020-04-29 14:08:12,ga9l7x,She should still be proud of and recognised for having a skill named after her !
484,2020-04-29 14:51:13,ga9l7x,"Her wolf turn is classy and well executed imo. It was her signature move and she was one of the few gymnasts who performed it. Her 2009 worlds routine is one of my all time favorites. She also made a small comeback in 2014. She’s definitely super underrated, but she is pretty accomplished having been world champion (plus silver on beam and floor 2009). At the 2011 world floor finals, she messed up her leap series, but because of how experienced she is, she was able to redo it at the end of her routine. https://youtu.be/ucURTU0VLIE"
485,2020-04-29 16:25:52,ga9l7x,"Another thing she innovated was doing leaps directly out of her tumbling passes! This was advantageous because it hid any landing deductions and also added some difficulty. As you can see at London 2012, there were a lot of gymnasts that followed in her footsteps and did leaps out of their tumbling!

This also motivated FIG to modify the rules, where you could only do leaps out of tumbling passes when the tumble was above a certain difficulty level. So Lauren Mitchell not only has her own move in the FIG code of points, but also instigated her ""own"" rule by the FIG."
486,2020-04-29 14:28:01,ga9l7x,"Back when she did the triple wolf, wolf turns were actually considered to be pretty unique. My favorite routine from her is her 2009 floor at worlds, I think it’s even better than her 2010 performance when she won gold."
487,2020-04-29 15:03:03,ga9l7x,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz9x7BG9NcY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz9x7BG9NcY)

I always liked her beam. She does her front tuck from standing, and used to do it out of a front handspring or walkover, both of which were unique since most gymnasts take a couple of running steps."
488,2020-04-30 07:44:01,ga9l7x,"This seems to be relevant at this time.

I'd put Allana Slater as another Australian WAG gymnast who had some recognition on the world stage."
489,2020-04-30 10:53:52,ga9l7x,Lauren really knew how to work the code to her advantage with her wolf turns and tumble leap combo passes.
490,2020-04-29 15:09:15,ga9l7x,"Lauren is actually a case of a not very talented gymnast who succeeded because she worked very, very hard. Her achievements were all the more spectacular when you think she didn't have natural ability like flexibility, air sense etc. 

The reason she did the wolf turns was because she wasn't very technically good on her regular turns, and this disguised it."
491,2020-04-29 18:03:21,ga9l7x,"Also, Lauren's wolf turns were pretty damn solid. Watching hers doesn't give me angst."
492,2020-04-29 15:29:43,ga9l7x,"I think it’s too harsh to say she wasn’t very talented - she was a powerful tumbler and very athletic, but it’s true that she’s one of those gymnasts who really maximized her ability through hard work, smart routine construction, and hitting when it counted. 

Maybe by the standards of people who won Worlds gold medals, she’s less naturally talented than most of her peers, but she was still a definite talent among international elites in general."
493,2020-04-30 08:01:01,ga9l7x,"There is a difference between ""not very talented"" and ""not naturally gifted"".

I can certainly believe that Lauren was one of those gymnasts who had to work extremely hard because it didn't come easily and naturally. I also do think much of her success was because she was clever - she was basically the trendsetter when it came to leaping out of tumbles to minimise landing deductions once the controlled lunge was removed from the code.

But saying that someone who became a World Champion and placed 5th at the Olympics and missed a medal by less than a .1 is ""not very talented"" is not really it."
494,2020-04-29 20:36:39,ga9l7x,"This isn't my estimation, but what her coaches say. 

I don't think she was particularly powerful at all. Have you seen her vault? Above average on FX but not huge. She had precise tumbling.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZ0qWBJA3v4"
495,2020-04-30 04:47:08,ga9l7x,"Yeah, I’ve seen her vault. She wouldn’t be the first who is a good tumbler and poor vaulter. It isn’t an automatic combination. 

I understand what you’re saying, I just think “not very talented” is a big exaggeration, even if her coaches said it. You absolutely need to have more talent than the average elite just to make an event final. I can certainly agree that Mitchell wasn’t the most naturally gifted and without unusually hard work, wouldn’t have been able to win multiple worlds medals."

546,2020-06-23 18:34:23,heiqjz,"I remember my mom picked me up from school FUMING and I couldn't figure out why until she finally exploded that they had set the vault at the wrong height.

The only time I've actually seen her watch the Olympics is when her friend competed in 1996 in a totally different sport. And she also never gets angry. It was wild."
547,2020-06-23 19:29:45,heiqjz,"I was just WAITING for this write up, you should make a YouTube channel like Defunctland that talks about all of these"
548,2020-06-23 20:03:10,heiqjz,"I've been quite enjoying these even when it's sports i dont really follow. 

A suggestion of another controversy, there was a game of badminton, maybe 2012, that both teams tried to lose to get a better draw in the finals. Both got disqualified. I remember laughing so hard, it seemed like perfect karma."
549,2020-06-23 19:38:48,heiqjz,"I'm confused as to your conclusion that these controversies led to US dominance.   The only reference I see to the USA in your writeup is that they got the bronze one time because the Chinese team were disqualified from the all-round competition.    Can you please elaborate a bit on how you came to your conclusion (note: I am not for a moment disputing the US dominance in women's gymnastics in recent Olympics, I just don't know how these 3 incidents led to that)?"
550,2020-06-24 00:33:09,heiqjz,"Another aspect to the Raducan story:

She had a significantly smaller body weight compared to her Romanian teammates. From what I remember is that other Romanians took the same medication but were cleared because it registered at lower levels in their test sample whereas the smaller Raducan registered just over the limit."
551,2020-06-23 20:14:28,heiqjz,"This series is great! I think that the vault issue was ridiculous and horrendous, although the fault seems very clearly attributed today. 
  
I think that the doping issues are still fairly controversial today especially due to the state-sponsored doping undergone by Russia. Personally, I believe that it is incumbent upon the athlete to make sure that they're not ingesting anything accidentally that is banned. While this does mean that some genuinely good-intentioned people will make an inadvertent mistake and get caught up in the regulations, I think that it's better to have the bright line test because intent is so hard to prove and people would otherwise always claim that they just didn't know (even when they do). 
  
While I don't disagree that it's sad about the state-sponsored age cheating that China does for gymnastics, I don't think that it makes it any more right. These athletes are cheating and they know that they're cheating. While we can absolutely point the finger at China as a whole (and I wonder, at what point does China actually get dinged for it in real time? Stripping the medal ten years later seems poor justice), I don't think that the athletes themselves should be absolved."
552,2020-06-23 21:40:12,heiqjz,"Could someone enlighten me as to the meaning of ""KIA"" please?

I'm both praying and assuming from context that the only Google result for that acronym, ""Killed In Action"", is not entirely relevant."
553,2020-06-23 19:13:01,heiqjz,"Thank you for doing these columns.

I absolutely am loving every bit of it."
554,2020-06-23 23:34:44,heiqjz,"I think they should’ve just stopped the competition at that point and did it another day. They were allowed to revault, but it threw quite a few off their game."
555,2020-06-24 00:36:01,heiqjz,"Whenever I need a chuckle I go look at the results of this competition and see over 50% of the names have a * next to it because of one of these three scandals. Such a dysfunctional mess.

On a side note: Liu Xuan gained a (stripped) bronze medal cuz of the Raducan scandal only to lose a bronze medal (stripped) cuz of the age falsification scandal."
556,2020-06-24 01:15:28,heiqjz,"I remember being a fan and watching this meet live.  The whole 2000 Olympics was disappointing overall.  It's the last Olympic All Around meet that was truly wide open.  The 1996 Olympic was really open as well. 

The all around competition was devastating for gymnasts like Elise Ray and Svetlana Khorkina who suffered from the vault height and later had falls.  Elise Ray, honestly, could've medaled due to all of the errors.

On top of that, you had Zamolodchikova, Karpenko, and Yang Yun all fall when in really good positions.  Karpenko's fall was the most devastating.  

The all around was such a mess that Liu Xuan took 4th (3rd with DQ).  As much as I stan Xuan, she had no business being 4th.  Even Lisa Skinner, the Australia goddess, was in 3rd at one point.  So many quality gymnasts in this meet and the only one's who benefitted were the Romanians (until the DQ).  

Another incredibly disappointing aspect to this competition was Esther Moya not getting the bronze on floor.  Talk about HUGE FREAKING RIP OFF!"
557,2020-06-24 00:43:54,heiqjz,I'm loving all these posts!! They bring back so many memories too!
558,2020-06-24 04:03:46,heiqjz,">Gymnasts don’t tend to have very long shelf lives.

Unless your name is Oksana Chusovitina, hee."
559,2020-06-23 22:36:09,heiqjz,"Maybe I missed it, but exactly how low was the vault? You said the standard was 4 feet 3 inches but I didn't see what the actual height was."
560,2020-06-23 23:46:39,heiqjz,"There have been one or two posts where I questioned the controversial nature of the event, but this was definitely a controversy."
561,2020-06-23 20:10:26,heiqjz,"Here you go!

[https://www.reddit.com/r/olympics/comments/hadwsf/controversial\_olympic\_moments\_revisited\_womens/](https://www.reddit.com/r/olympics/comments/hadwsf/controversial_olympic_moments_revisited_womens/)"
562,2020-06-23 19:42:05,heiqjz,It was sarcasm. Apologies if that wasn't clear.
563,2020-06-23 22:23:48,heiqjz,"But then you're putting responsibility on the shoulders of a 14 year old child.  Regardless of her mental competence at that age, what do you think her options were?  Even if she had refused to participate, there goes her future in the sport.  Maybe even more.  

If one adult, never mind a large established group of them, tell a child to do something wrong and she does it, it is the fault of the adults, not the child."
564,2020-06-23 22:52:15,heiqjz,"I understand how you feel about the Chinese gymnasts, but it's very much a cultural thing as well. China is a society that's very much built on honor. Unfortunately, China also has a major class imbalance as well. For parents with more of a disadvantage, sports is often the next best option outside of academics. So if their kid shows an immense talent in a sport, they've hit the jackpot.

Around China are several sports schools that feed off of this desire. Very young kids are sent there at very young ages to train. Many of them do so not primarily because they love the sport (though of course, that is there) but mostly because they live in a society where you are expected to bring honor to your parents and they're taught that their athletic abilities are the way to do that.

Even if the gymnasts knew they were competing as underage athletes, it's really not their place to say no. Doing so is almost on the same level as committing a crime in Chinese culture because of the dishonor you bring on the family and the nation. And mind you, these are young kids. As u/MildlyResponsible said, they don't have other options. A career was picked for them and they're basically trapped in it.

In the United States, we take for granted the fact that we feel our athletes control their own destinies. This is sadly not the case in some nations. Yes, it would be easy to say ""let's put all the blame on the individual Chinese gymnasts for willingly competing illegally"", but that comes off as incredibly harsh to athletes who have been manipulated by the system they grew up in to essentially justify their wrongs. In the eyes of the system they were groomed in, there's nothing wrong with this.

Sadly, morality is not always a black and white thing. The IOC tried to amend the wrong by DQ'ing these athletes, but they really only put a bandage on a shotgun wound. It's going to take an entire cultural overhaul to fix this. Unfortunately, from my experience, old cultural habits never change. And in my opinion, this is exactly why the Chinese sporting system will also never change.

To me, it's a tragedy because it's sad *and* unsolvable."
565,2020-06-23 21:55:06,heiqjz,"It does mean killed in action, but only with respect to Reeder's chances of finishing the competition, not her own life thankfully!"
566,2020-06-24 01:09:26,heiqjz,why would Xuan's medal be stripped?  are you sure this is correct?
567,2020-06-24 00:02:34,heiqjz,"It was 2 inches too low, making it 4 feet 1 inch. That's actually not insignificant if you measure it out. It meant the athletes had more kinetic energy built up when their hands contacted the vault. Not to mention the angle at which they contacted the vault also would have been completely screwed up."
568,2020-06-23 22:40:32,heiqjz,"Perfect, didn't realise you'd already done it"
569,2020-06-23 19:44:49,heiqjz,oh!   apologies for not realizing!
570,2020-06-23 22:58:36,heiqjz,"But we still take away medals from Olympians who are teenagers if they dope, knowingly or not knowingly. The argument that you're making about China applies to everything that China does. How much autonomy do their citizens really have? I think that the pressures to win apply just as much to Chinese adults, but we're not giving them a free pass. 
  
I absolutely believe that the blame lies with China. I just also think that these gymnasts know what they're doing. That doesn't make China less culpable, but it also doesn't make the athletes' actions and omissions ok. 
  
I feel sorry for the kids who are competing illegally, but I don't think that makes it right. And I think that stronger action should be taken against China to prevent it happening in the future--it's very dangerous for the kids. But, as that action hasn't been taken, my guess is that it will continue to occur."
571,2020-06-23 23:04:51,heiqjz,"I hear what you're saying, but I think that this goes back to a bright line test, just the same as doping. If a sixteen year old is found to have taken an illegal substance, even unknowingly, the fault is deemed to lie with them. 
  
I don't think that anything in what I said implies that I don't think that China bears the brunt of the blame. In fact I said that we should absolutely point the finger at China. But, I also believe that for the same reason that we hold other teenage athletes culpable for cheating in the Olympics, we should also hold these athletes responsible. Cheating is cheating. And yes, it is really horrible and sad for what is occurring in China. Which is why I think that more responsibility needs to be laid at China and the athletes' feet in a more timely manner. If you have stricter punishments that come back to the country (China) in this manner, then the risk of that punishment outweighs the impetus to cheat. Getting stripped of a medal ten years after the fact is functionally meaningless. 
  
I'm not advocating for black and white morality but rather a bright line test for if an action at the Olympics is ok. And part of those actions rest within the athletes' control. I'm not sure why age would get a pass and not taking banned substances."
572,2020-06-23 22:14:17,heiqjz,"Ah, that makes perfect sense then - thank you for the clarification!"
573,2020-06-24 01:18:02,heiqjz,"Liu Xuan finished 4th in the All-Around. After Raducan is stripped of her gold medal everyone moves up one spot. This bumps Liu Xuan up to bronze.

Liu Xuan and team China finished 3rd in the Team final earning her a bronze medal. However this medal is stripped after the entire team is disqualified for having one of their members ineligible due to a falsified age."
574,2020-06-23 23:39:57,heiqjz,"I'm all for taking away this girl's medal, but I don't think she herself should be punished, i.e. a suspension.  You have to take the medal away to deter future attempts at this sort of thing, and also to be fair to other gymnasts.  But I don't see any value in punishing a child as young as 13/14 for something that was forced on them.  Punish the national Olympic Committee or the coaches instead.  

As for doping, that's a bit different.  The rules about age are there to protect the athlete, while the rules about doping are there to protect **other** athletes, with the health of the one athlete a secondary consideration.  But I don't think we should treat a 14 year old child taking drugs at the Olympics any different than a child taking drugs in their suburban communities (or anywhere else).  In both cases the child is doing something that s/he doesn't understand the consequences of, both for him/herself and for others.  Help would be more warranted than punishment in both cases.  In fact, the athlete is probably being pressured or even forced to dope which kind of makes it worse.  Taking away a medal to be fair to the other athletes is fair, but so is counselling, investigating coaches and support staff and support for the kid."
575,2020-06-23 23:52:06,heiqjz,"I have lived in China, so while I'm not an expert or anything, I am also not completely talking about of my butt.  Having said that, while I think the pressure is probably much worse in China, it is present in every country and culture.  

Imagine back to when you were 13.  You've been doing your sport your whole life.  Not even really going to school or having friends.  Your one goal is to make it to the Olympics one day.  

Suddenly, your coaches say you're going to the Olympics next year.  That can't be right, you're too young, you think.  Your coaches assure you there's no problem.  It's just a technicality.  Your parents say the same.  Your teammates also say the same thing, and say if you don't go then they will not win gold and it will be all your fault.  Everyone around is telling you your dream just came true, that the only issue isn't really an issue, and that if you refuse you're letting everyone down.  Oh, and if you refuse, you will never practice this sport again competitively in your country.  

It's not even about a moral decision.  When I was 13 I would have probably just done what my teachers, parents and everyone else around me told me to do.  The kid probably thought it was fine since everyone around her was saying it was fine.  As the OP said, the gymnast didn't even try to hide her age when she was an Olympic official later on.  

It's like your mom promises you (13) a puppy next month, but your dad comes home with one that night and tells you to keep it a secret.  Does the mom blame and punish the kid when she finds the dog later that week?  Or does she blame and punish the dad?  

I'm a teacher, and while I'm huge on accountability in children, there is a line where you can't blame them for doing what every adult in their life is telling them to do.  That's why most countries have different laws for minors as adults."
576,2020-06-24 01:21:53,heiqjz,Oh I thought you were suggesting she lost her all around bronze medal too.  Sorry I misread this.
577,2020-06-24 00:50:47,heiqjz,"I'm in no way disagreeing about the difficulty of having everyone tell you one thing and feeling like your whole life relies on it. I'm not saying that the kids who do this are morally bankrupt people. Sports are incredibly competitive and my heart goes out to all the kids who at thirteen are already facing the pressures of the Olympics. But, I still feel that this is a punishable offense. Why? Because the rules say that people under a certain age should not be competing at the Olympics because it is dangerous for them and it gives them an unfair advantage (for women) compared to other athletes. How do you enforce this? A) By punishing the country that engages in known and repeated offenses of it and B) by actually enforcing the rules against an athlete who does it. If the gymnast in question were from the US or from Russia and knowingly lied to do it, would there be a outcry if they weren't suspended? Absolutely. Why does China get a pass for cultural reasons? The rule is the rule. Again, I'm not saying that I don't feel for these kids, because I absolutely do. It is an incredibly difficult situation. But I don't think that cultural reasons excuse cheating, be it lying about your age or doping, and while lying about your age may have a different punishment than a different cheating offense, I still think it's cheating."
578,2020-06-24 01:22:11,heiqjz,Well she still has a gold on beam to cuddle up to.
579,2020-06-24 01:26:20,heiqjz,"All I was saying: Because of medals being stripped she went +1 and later -1

Technically speaking an individual medal is considered more prestigious than a team medal, and an AA medal is the most prestigious of the individual medals, so Liu Xuan came out ahead."
580,2020-06-24 01:37:19,heiqjz,"I was especially happy for her beam gold.  The whole beam final medalists excited me greatly.  Loved seeing Lobaz, Prodie, and Xuan get medals."
581,2020-06-19 22:34:38,hc79wz,She's honestly the greatest athlete ever
582,2020-06-20 01:50:25,hc79wz,Did she stopped competing in the olympics?  Looks like she’s leaner
583,2020-06-20 02:35:01,hc79wz,No she is just off PEDs because no comps are going on and they don’t know when the olympics will take place. She has to time everything in advance to pass drug tests for the Olympics.
584,2020-06-20 06:57:30,hc79wz,I don’t think she’s on PEDs ever
585,2020-06-20 03:15:52,hc79wz,I love how your tone suggests she wouldn’t be as bad ass or as if she isn’t just keeping up with the competition.
586,2020-06-20 03:17:42,hc79wz,She is bad ass. I never said this or meant this through tone. Her dedication and work ethic is unparalleled. She is keeping up exactly with the competition because they are all in the same boat.
587,2020-06-20 03:33:00,hc79wz,My bad. I misread your tone/intention.

598,2020-06-16 21:04:36,haa5fw,I’m glad Simone has the freedom to play around with skills even if they’re not ever making it to competition. I think enjoys pushing herself in ways that are actually just for her own enjoyment.

634,2020-06-17 08:49:37,haa5fw,"They downgraded the amanar from a 6.3 to a 5.8 because every other event got a .5 CR downgrade (it went from 2.5 to 2.0). And given that vault doesn't have CR, this was the equivalent. They slashed vault start values across the board (and normalized them too, what with the .4 half twist increments). 

There's no controversy in the amanar being a 5.8, imo.

636,2020-06-17 08:54:41,haa5fw,There was a discussion regarding the amanar and DTY whether is it worth it to do an amanar or a DTY with a 0.4 D score difference. I’m sorry but I’m not saying that it is a controversial thing to drop the amanar to a 5.8 D score.

641,2020-06-16 00:26:12,h9kpg8,"I mean, she’d be smart to have counsel generally with her status and position. At the very least she’d want someone with legal experience to review contracts and consult on issues.

Edit: looked up the lawyer and it’s specifically someone who specializes in sexual abuse cases. Still smart to have regardless of plans to sue or not, since she’s a survivor and it definitely comes up."
642,2020-06-16 17:29:43,h9kpg8,"If she doesn’t compete for USAG she can’t compete at the elite level in America, and USAG isn’t going to release her to Belize"

I don't know what metric to use, and I know it's just another data point to get, but perhaps 1st to 2nd as a percentage of the gap of someone else that made that final 5th or 8th or something in a lot of simultaneous races (eg swimming, athletics), also applies for asynchronous judged sports (eg gymnastics)"

695,2020-06-06 19:08:27,gxv810,"Strongly disagree with Jade as the quintessential American floor routine. I think Americans get a bad rap for their floor artistry in general, but even if you believe their artistry is bad across the board Jade (as good as her tumbling is) is still significantly worse in that aspect. It doesn’t reflect the level of artistry that most high level Americans actually have. I think I’d suggest Aly’s 2016 routine instead: still has the very difficult tumbling but with artistry that’s closer to what’s typical for US ladies. 

I don’t think I’d use Simone for bars either but I’m not sure who I’d suggest instead."
696,2020-06-07 16:43:19,gxv810,"Yeah, I'm gonna have to disagree with nearly every single one of these. I don't think any of these are ""quintessential"" I think they are ""stereotypical"" routines for those countries. But certainly not the routines which exemplify a particular country's style."

Romania - Ponor Beam, Lavinia Milosovec Floor 1992

Russia/Soviet Union - mustafina bars, Olesa Dudnik beam, Natalia Leshenova Floor

698,2020-06-06 23:32:21,gxv810,"Romania beam - Ponor 2012

Romania floor - Izbasa 2008 or Raducan 2001

For China actually I think Yao Jinnan’s floor from 2011 is more representative of them than Sui Lu. However Sui Lu 2011 on beam is the quintessential Chinese beam routine for me. As for bars, definitely Yang Yilin 2008, not as exciting as He Kevin’s but the body position on the pirouettes is the definition of Chinese bars."
699,2020-06-07 04:19:11,gxv810,">For Russia Daria Spiridonova’s 2019 UB routine from Worlds qualifs is such a typical Russian routine. It has the insane combinations of transitional skills, that weird half giant, and overall a composition found in countless Russian bar routines.

That half giant thing that Komova did too? I feel like they lose points for handstands. It's pretty hard to get it perfect like that :-(

I also think Spiridonova has one of the best swing styles around. I know I'm not unique in this considering her record lol but I really think she has some of the lightness and ease of Komova with a bit of Mustafina too. Unfortunately, I feel like her handstands are sometimes lacking what those two had.

>For the US Simone Biles 2019 UB routine from the US championships symbolizes US bar work. It’s has skills typical of a powerful gymnast like the weiler kip 1/2, and the fabrichova. It also has multiple tkatchevs, common in US bars.

Also agree. I think Jordyn had a good ""US style"" too.

>For the US, Shawn Johnson’s 2008 Beam Routine from the VISA Championships is a perfect representation of US beam. She has a very aggressive and tumbling heavy routine.

I know she's won an Olympic gold, but I still think her beam is underrated. It was that good."

732,2020-08-11 19:53:05,i7yae7,"A Shewfelt (Amanar) is a 5.2 and a Y 1/2 on, 2/1 off (Biles) is a 5.4.

In 2019, the absolute best vaulters were throwing two 6.0 vaults... but neither made the podium for various reasons. Instead, the podium was swept by three men who had 2 5.6 vaults. Note: Cunningham had a 5.2/5.4 combo and came in 5th, so even with ""just"" a Shewfelt/Biles combo she certainly could make the final.

So a few things to note, were Simone to compete in MAG:

* The vault table would be higher for her, which leads to more air time (I don't see a reason why that would be a roadblock to her; were she training on a higher table, I think she'd adjust her entry just fine).  
* Simone has absolutely held herself back on vault because there's absolutely no reason for her to push herself and potentially risk injury - she's miles ahead of others (when she hits; I know her '19 quals had some hiccups).  
* Simone has stunningly great execution... whereas I fear watching men's vault finals because of how they chuck shit a lot of the time to increase their difficulty.

I think it is a very conservative statement to claim that if she were competing in MAG, she could *absolutely* be doing a Shirai/TTY + her Biles, which would be a 5.6/5.4 combo. And because of her execution, I have zero doubts that she could fight for a spot on the podium even though it's not quite a 5.6/5.6 or a 6.0 vault. 

And like I said, that's a conservative thought. I think it's underplaying her abilities, and I would not be surprised to learn that if pushed, she was capable of a Li Xiao Peng (5.8) or even, insanely, a Y-3.5 (theoretically a 6.0 vault). 

Tl;dr: I truly believe Simone would have a viable shot at the men's vault podium."
733,2020-08-11 20:56:18,i7yae7,"Good thoughts. I would love to see Simone compete floor against men after Tokyo, just for fun!"
734,2020-08-11 21:10:09,i7yae7,"Simone would almost certainly have the difficulty to compete in men's FX. The Biles II is a G in MAG (aka the Ri Jong Song there), and is already a higher difficulty element by itself than anything done by the reigning world men's FX champion (and also more difficult than any skill attempted at men's FX at US nationals!).

However, the MAG do put together FX combinations that add up to more points.

As others have pointed out, though, MAG don't have to land feet together in FX, which could potentially uncork more ridiculousness from Simone were she competing under those circumstances.

I think she could at least be in the mix for EFs in floor in MAG, even in international meets."
735,2020-08-11 20:12:30,i7yae7,"Like others have said, even without upgrading her vaults due to her execution she could realistically contend for a medal if others aren't as on as she consistently is on vault. It wouldn't be the same degree of dominance as in WAG, but it says a lot that execution alone with relatively easy MAG vaults would make her a contender."
736,2020-08-11 20:05:21,i7yae7,"If you look at her execution scores and her most difficult vaults, she could make vault finals and contend for a medal. This is especially true considering the men's vaulting table is set higher than the women's vaulting table, which would give her more room to complete her hardest vaults.

The Biles vault (Round-off half on, layout double full) has a 5.4 difficulty value in MAG. The Amanar has a 5.2 difficulty value. If we look at the 2019 MAG vault finals at Worlds, her difficulty would be low, but matches Dominick Cunningham's, who finished in fifth place less than 0.200 behind the bronze medalist. Add to that Simone's absolutely impeccable execution,  which would stand out even more in MAG than WAG, and she could contend for a medal without even upgrading her vaults.

On top of that, with the added height of the men's table I think a triple twisting yurchenko or the yurchenko double pike she has been training would be possible for her. Either one would up her difficulty value from a 5.2 to a 5.6, making a medal very realistic."
737,2020-08-12 03:45:18,i7yae7,Kenzo would probably be an actual competitor for her! I always think of him as her MAG counterpart.
738,2020-08-12 14:53:24,i7yae7,"Thanks for your input!

&#x200B;

I wonder then why so many people say she would not manage the vault in MAG.

I mean she would be obliterated in the upper body exercises, but apparently not the vault or floor I suppose."
739,2020-08-12 22:51:46,i7yae7,"She could improved to be in contention for the men’s difficulty in the two apparatus that they share, but she could never be in contention for an all-around title. For men, it’s way harder to be an all-around gymnast because the optimal body types for each apparatus conflicts. In WAG, Simone can be a Vault, Balance Beam, and Floor specialist, but it’s hard to be a Horizontal Bar, Still Rings, and Pommel Horse specialist. Even if a man is good at Floor, Parallel Bars, and Vault, one of the other three events is likely to be their weakness because the amount of muscle required is a hindrance to other events. That’s why there are so few male gymnast that are world class at all events."
740,2020-08-11 19:38:10,i7yae7,"She would need to up her vault D to contend on vault, she could probably do it though. Most men in VT EF have at least 2 different 5.6 D vaults. I believe the RO half on 2/1 is a 5.4 vault. Yurchenko double pike or a Yurchenko 3/1 would be a 5.6.

I think floor is where she could very easily contend for a MAG medal. She has plenty of competitive skills to choose from not even including upgrades:

Triple double: G

Double double Lay: F

Double double: E

Double lay 1/1: E

Biles: E

Plenty of D rated skills


If she added back some twisting skills in order to get some CV, she’s got a very competitive routine with stellar execution. Just needs landing control."
741,2020-08-13 15:19:30,i7yae7,"Copypasting a comment I did in another sub a few weeks ago (a few things may be redundant because it was aimed to people who might not be entirely familiar with gymnastics scoring, and it was in a general comparison between men and somen in sports. She was basically the one example I could come up with of an elite female athlete that would be competitive at the men's elite level.):

Once I read an analysis about Simone Biles in the vault events in gymnastics. 

The code of points varies between women and men, the same vaults have a different difficulty score in women's events and in men's events. Usually, they are given lower difficulty values for men than for women. Simone's vaults still retain a lot of difficulty in the men's code and she has an unusually high execution for someone who does skills that difficult. Vault is probably the only truly comparable event because it's the only one where men and women to the same exact thing (men's floor has strength elements and women's floor has dance elements, so they're not the same). 

I checked the [2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_World_Artistic_Gymnastics_Championships) and [2018](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_World_Artistic_Gymnastics_Championships)  World Championships for comparison. 

Simone does an Amanar and a Cheng in vault, which have a difficulty score respectively 5.8 and 6.0 in the Women's gymnastics code. These same vaults in the men's code (at least according to [this document](https://www.gymnastics.sport/publicdir/rules/files/en_MAG%20CoP%202017%20-%202020.pdf) ) have a difficulty score of 5.0 and 5.2 (Page 104), so they're 0.8 points less, so assuming she kept her execution score in both of her vaults, if she was doing those vaults in the men's final and getting scored under the men's code in 2019 she would have scored 14.599, placing fifth, and in 2018 she would have scored 14.566, placing sixth. 

Now, that is not peak Simone. In 2018 during qualifications she did the Biles vault, which is basically a Cheng with an extra half turn in before landing and that to keep it short the hardest vault ever done by a woman, and she got a really high execution score to boot (execution-wise, she beat all the men). That vault is 6.4 in the women's code, and 5.4 in the men's code, so a full point less. In qualifications she did this and an Amanar, and under the men's code and keeping her execution this would have got 14.766 and she would have the bronze medal in the vault final. 

[I found it. Someone was saying that with an execution score of 9.666 in both vaults she would have tied for gold in the 2019 men's final and, since the tie-breaking criteria is execution she would have won.](https://gymfanconfessions.tumblr.com/post/188681501993) And she can get those execution scores. [In Rio she got 9.7 three times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOCKKSNmE88). And since the 2018 winner had a lower score, she could have won that final too.

Now, I don't think she ever got 9.666 in the Biles in international competitions. In the 2018 qualifications she got 9.566. On the other hand, she got up to 9.7 in her Amanar in Rio. I did a bit of math and performing those vaults with those executions in a men's final she would get 14.933, which would make her tie for silver in 2019 and tie for gold in 2018, in both cases winning the tie break because of higher execution.

So yes, peak Simone Biles, performing the two hardest vaults she's ever done, with the two highest executions she's gotten in them, could win a men's vault final."
742,2020-08-11 20:42:36,i7yae7,"I agree with everything here, though I’m not sure how much her far superior execution would be rewarded. Men’s vault e scores are often very bunched like the women. Not sure if a Shewfelt and the Biles would cut it because of that. She could totally upgrade though."
743,2020-08-11 20:52:28,i7yae7,"Don't you think a 10 cm higher vault table might even help? I'm sure there are detriments, but potentially it'd help her get more height and more time in the air for various twists and flips!"
744,2020-08-12 02:37:23,i7yae7,I’m glad I’m not the only one who fears watching MAG vault lol. I usually skip it if I’m watching event finals on youtube because it makes me so nervous!
745,2020-08-12 00:39:24,i7yae7,"Qualifier I know very little about MAG

Would not having to dance in between passes in MAG open up some room for more endurance/difficult skills? Or does that not make that much of a difference"
746,2020-08-13 03:40:09,i7yae7,"Ok I've thought a lot though about Simone on rings and I wholeheartedly believe she could do a good all-around gymnast-standard rings set. Her core strength is so strong and it's not like she doesn't have arm muscles... I think she'd be similar to a Yul Moldauer rings set, where it's not going to blow you away, but its clean and doable and can keep you in contention.

I would LOVE to see her on high bar. Literally would love it. Can you imagine her doing a Cassina??? Because I can. And it's excellent. 

I think she would hate pommel. And thus wouldn't want to get good at it. Which I don't blame her, because pommel is boring unless it's straight flares. 

P-Bars would be great too, I think. Again, her core strength and clean execution... Plus she'd probably chuck a double double off the bars and the FIG would be like ""um""

Now I've just decided that Simone needs to ""retire"" to MAG. Maybe the sport would get more popular in the US that way."
747,2020-08-11 20:10:42,i7yae7,the different MAG Cop would be very helpful for her landings too since she'd be allowed to land with feet separated whereas WAG are forced to stick with feet together (which I think is so dumb that that point differs like let both of them land with feet separate and bring them together if you want to force sticks that much? Good thing WAG's getting the lunge back)
748,2020-08-13 15:25:21,i7yae7,"Adding to this: I think she may have also a shot on floor, although I haven't checked this with so much detail. The fact that her weakest event is bars, which is the one most similar to the other men's aparatuses in my opinion, hints that she probably would have much less of a chance in high bar, parallel bars, rings and pommel."
749,2020-08-11 21:04:26,i7yae7,"Sorry if that was unclear - I absolutely think it would help. More air time & height absolutely helps. 

(I was just stating that I think she'd be able to adjust her entry just fine).

Edit: those 3 bullets are all meant to be things in her favor and why you can't do a direct comparison between what she competes right now vs what she would compete in a mag comp."
750,2020-08-12 00:56:36,i7yae7,"I don't think it'd make much of a difference, since men can do up to 5 passes, and they usually do. The men also have to do a non-acrobatic move, like a handstand, or a balance or flairs, etc. But I don't think stamina would be a problem for Miss Dismounts-With-A-Silivas!"

754,2020-08-06 01:48:28,i4i8ou,"I want Chellsie on the team, but not sure who she would replace."
755,2020-08-06 03:46:53,i4i8ou,"IN MY DREAM WORLD:

TEAM: SIMONE BILES, SUNI LEE, RILEY MCCUSKER, CHELLSIE MEMMEL

VAULT: CHELLSIE, SUNI, SIMONE

BARS: SIMONE, RILEY, SUNI

BEAM: CHELLSIE, RILEY, SIMONE

FLOOR: CHELLSIE, SUNI, SIMONE

INDIVIDUAL
- JADE CAREY
- GRACE MCCALLUM (because as an AAer, she is the third best on this team IMO so she could challenge Suni. And with her new bar routine, she could challenge for the second spot there too. She could’ve made the team but either she or Suni would’ve had to do beam and right now, I don’t trust either of them on that event) 

PEOPLE WHO DIDNT MAKE MY TEAM WHO HAVW A GOOD SHOT

Morgan: She could replace Grace as the second specialist or be on the team, but if she is on the team, she would be replacing Chellsie so I’m waiting to see how her floor routine is. 

Leanne: She could’ve made the team if she had an Amanar/Cheng. And right now, I don’t trust her floor yet. 

The major weakness on my team is vault, but unfortunately none of the strong vaulters are consistent on beam (unless you consider Leanne who HAD a strong DTY but we don’t know where it went)"

761,2020-08-06 03:32:02,i4i8ou,"Dream team for me would be Simone, Suni, Riley, and Chellsie right now. 

If Chellsie can really get back to a good spot and Riley performs like she has at her good meets in the past, this would actually make for a really solid team with no major gaps on any event.

As for the second specialists spot, I don't have a strong leaning right now to be honest."
762,2020-08-06 12:23:31,i4i8ou,"Main team: 

“Locks”: simone, Suni

“Options”: Laurie, Chellsie, Riley but depending on how strong their AA is at the time, in particular their DTYs. Obviously for Laurie and Chellsie, this also depends on if their comebacks translate to successful competitions.

“Less likely”: MyKayla (particularly because her strengths/weaknesses compliment Riley’s so well). I also think Grace, Leanne, and Morgan could make argument with increased difficulty, execution, or real medal potential. The fact that Jade is likely taking an individual spot and her scores can’t be counted for the team makes a strong vault and floor appealing

Individual.

“Locks”: Jade 

“Options”: Laurie, Chellsie, Kara

Again, dependent on comeback progress and for Kara beam composition and consistency."

USAG, USOC, the international gymnastics community, fans (even the most casual fans) etc. expect and demand so much from her when in reality the only thing everyone should be feeling when they think of Simone Biles is GRATITUDE. As others on this sub have noted plenty of times, she’s literally a phenomenon that makes you feel lucky to be alive just to witness it. She deserves our thanks for her hard work and the obstacles she has repeatedly hurdled to become that, all the while maintaining a selfless perspective and gracious attitude...instead, for so long people have been comfortable doing nothing but taking from her. Simone, THANK YOU for being you, and I support you in whatever your next steps are!"

789,2020-08-06 17:57:16,i374cf,"To say Simone Biles is “lucky” to have been given the perfect body for the sport of gymnastics is just such... an unbelievable statement to me. Simone’s tiny body fought to survive in her mother’s womb. Simone’s mom was a drug addict and was in jail 27 times while pregnant with Simone. Baby Biles was born with opioids in her system and struggled with withdrawal at birth. Her “small” build was probably caused by intrauterine growth restriction - common in children born to addicts. When a mother is such a heavy user of drugs while pregnant, the baby doesn’t get the sufficient nutrients to thrive - they have to adapt to survive. If a glass of wine is considered bad in pregnancy, imagine a heroin addiction and a mother who was in jail 27 times for such addiction? Simone’s ADHD that Russians exposed? A longterm affect of babies born with drugs in their system. Simone Biles is a survivor in EVERY sense of the word. To say her body was just engineered to be the perfect gymnast is just... so far from the truth. Her body was engineered to survive since she was a fetus. Everything she has accomplished with her body is her own doing. It’s her hard work, it’s her determination, it’s her “light”. If anything, a baby born in Simone’s circumstances had zero advantages. Not to mention all the trauma Simone had to deal after she was born (her first memory is of being hungry and afraid) - to all the abuse she suffered at USAG... Simone is a hero. She’s her OWN hero. She was born with disadvantages in every aspect... black, with opioids in her system, struggled to survive in her mother’s womb, foster child, hunger, fear, trauma... Her body was NEVER engineered for gymnastics. It was engineered to survive and all Simone has accomplished with it is a direct result of her hard work, determination and uncanny resilience."

I’m a former athlete, albeit not in gymnastics (I’m 5’10 and have been since I was 14 lol and I can barely touch my toes) but I feel like maybe fellow athletes can understand better than people who never played sports what goes into it. 

I played softball and I had all the genetic predispositions to being a good batter, I’m tall and naturally strong and my lower body strength is better than my upper body strength. But I didn’t walk onto the field hitting homeruns. I spent hours first just practicing my swing without hitting a ball, then hitting the ball off the tee, then my hitting coach would just toss the ball up in the air and have me hit it, then I hit off a pitching machine, then finally a real pitcher. Over and over again for so long. That’s what made me able to hit home runs, not the fact that I’m tall and have good lower body strength. 

Gymnastics is especially unique bc it involves skills that other sports don’t as much, and so people are typically more mystified by it. But I absolutely think fans, journalists, and commentators should make sure to keep the focus on the athlete and praise their hard work and not just the fact that they won the genetic lottery, bc that will never be enough to make a champion."
812,2020-08-04 18:21:18,i374cf,"I’m with you — I was a competitive gymnast when I was younger and then played another sport in college. A lot of the time people just assume the sports were easy for me bc I have a naturally somewhat high vertical, but it was actually the long hours I put into getting the technique right, for both sports. Agree with all your comments here!"

814,2020-08-05 04:49:17,i374cf,"I see this a lot in fields like music and art too. When I tell people I play the piano, or they see me play, almost everyone makes comments about me being lucky that I’m talented, or that they wish they could play but just couldn’t learn because of a lack of talent. I have practiced and worked countless hours since I was 5 years old. Whatever natural talent I may have been born with — and of course the luck to have been born into a musical family — is massively outweighed by the hard work I put into learning, practicing, and performing. Talent alone is not enough. And here’s the thing: with enough practice, even someone who is not “talented” — or to whom it does not come as naturally — can learn to play. It just takes consistent effort. People don’t want to admit that they didn’t work as hard, or maybe didn’t care as much."
815,2020-08-05 05:31:30,i374cf,"This is quasi off topic but they had this exact conversation on the Scrubs Rewatch podcast a few weeks ago.

I remember Sarah Chalke was on the ep because she was joking about her athletic abilities (and how hard she had to work to make the basketball team iirc?). So it must have been episode 1:19."
816,2020-08-01 05:08:58,i1m15k,"I disagree with this for a few reasons.

1 - this puts those who are stronger with certain tumbling skills at a disadvantage. Those that are better at front tumbling and twisting (like dowell and liukin) would be seriously penalized for their tumbling. It also would limit D-score building and a better way to see more variety is to increase value in front tumbling and some twisting.

2 - the simpler version of a skill thing you mentioned is not completely true. Morgan Hurd did a moors in 2018, but never (that we know of) was able to to a chusovitina.

3 - the arguing about this lack of variety has only started since the inflation/changing/innovation of newer back tumbling skills. Nobody complains about the chinese gymnasts from 2015 doing a routine of 3.5 + punch, 1.5 + triple + punch, 2.5 + punch, and double tuck(to meet the double salto requirement). Only from Moors, silivas, chuso, and front + double tuck/full in.

A way to compromise would be to have the front salto (since you need a front and a back salto in a tumbling run) need to count in the D-score, so gymnasts can’t get away with a front tuck step-out to a back tumble."
817,2020-08-01 06:08:56,i1m15k,"I think your plan would disincentivize innovation in the sport. If Simone had to drop her double-double to introduce the triple-double or Chellsie had to drop her tucked arabian on beam to introduce the piked arabian, that would be a major factor in whether they even try to create new skills. 

I think a better solution is to have a bonus on floor for doing unique passes. Floor scores have been low relative to the other events this quad, so offering another way to add difficulty would work well. Possibly one tenth in bonus per each tumbling pass if it meets certain requirements of being different from your other passes?"
818,2020-08-01 04:47:18,i1m15k,I must admit watching Memmels comeback makes me want more skill variety too. Theres something really cool about her schools compared to what is going on now

855,2020-07-29 15:14:40,hzqgb4,"Eh...minor quibble because I mostly agree with you, but I would say it's a defining trait of someone's *identity*, but not *personality*. Being a POC is very much a part of who I am: my family history and how we got to where we are today, what my life has been like, how other people see me.  Someone who is ""colorblind"" is ignoring very real parts of my experience and very real inequities POC like me face.

But my race does not define my *personality.*  Being Asian doesn't mean I'm quiet and submissive, or whatever stereotypes people may have about Asian personalities (not saying that YOU are saying this, just pointing out why I think the distinction between the words ""personality"" and ""identity"" matters!). It also does not define my *culture*: my family has been in the US for 150 years and I grew up in CA, so my culture is tacos as much as it is rice, and I speak English (and a little bit of Spanish), but not Chinese or Japanese.

I generally disagree with strapped\_ruler because I think race and representation DOES matter and reverse racism isn't real (racism being defined as ""prejudice + power""; prejudice against white people is real, but white people are the one with power so they don't face structural racism).

But I do see strapped\_ruler's point about not defining people *solely* by their race. As a POC, I face assumptions about my personality/culture all the time in ways white people don't, and that sucks.  I grew up NOT wanting people to see me as ""Asian"", because they made assumptions about me because of it that were wrong. So back then, I wanted people to be ""colorblind""; I only changed my thinking later in life when I learned about structural racism.  Many other POC (particularly ones who grew up with not many other people like them around) have felt this way as well, about not wanting to be defined by their race."

I suspect it's the same in regards to picking students as in Russia also.  It's not as risky to start early when everyone has a perfect body.  In Russia you show up and they have all the kids in their underwear and they measure their necks and legs and feet and potential turnout and you only get to start if you have the perfect facility to dance.  Then they kick kids out of the program on a yearly basis and they don't really care if they get injured or too tall or weigh five pounds too much because there are others in their place.  There's this horribly depressing documentary on Youtube that I watched that showed a kid trying to get into one of the big schools (Bolshoi maybe) she had a beautiful ballet body.

953,2020-07-21 09:01:41,hv2a3s,">In my opinion, Myk's best argument is to throw new and insane skills like Biles does. Screw improving execution

""like Biles does"" doesn't work without improving execution and even more importantly technique. You can't have difficulty without execution and technique. Well, strictly speaking you can, but advocating dangerously unsafe skills is not the gymnastics I want to see."
954,2020-07-21 07:16:02,hv2a3s,"I don’t think this tactic will work and I think she knows it. Ultimately she needs to show improvement in her execution. Those are essentially the terms everyone has been giving her for years and she has to show she’s listened. I know that sounds patronizing. But essentially judges and NTC give every gymnast the idea of how to make a 4 person team.

Morgan needs to upgrade from 2019 to be competitive with everyone in terms of D scores.

Riley needs to stay healthy enough through a full season. 

Suni needs to improve consistency.

Mykayla is there with D scored and certainly can show upgrades, but her form and execution in general needs to improve because international judges will be even more harsh than domestic. I think she fully realizes this. She’s been working on it."
955,2020-07-21 14:13:51,hv2a3s,"Here's the thing: I really admire her improvement and her drive, but based on the crazy depth of the entire field, I still can't see where they'd use her. Simone and Jade already have the top two floor and vault spots; she can't take Jade's spot and she isn't going to top Simone (barring god forbid injury or something). She's not going to be a medal threat for beam or bars and unlikely to even be in the lineup for those.  

People keep saying they need her floor and vault for the team because Jade won't be performing there, but come on - the US is not hurting for depth. There are a zillion options for good vault and floor scores from gymnasts who will also bring in better beam and bars scores than MyKayla would, and maybe even be in medal contention there. 

Of course, if they're simply choosing the team based on who has the best AA scores, and she gets herself into the top AA the way you suggest, my point is moot. I do appreciate the straightforward transparency in the new system. I just think it'll suck a little bit if that results in a team that doesn't complement each other and takes gymnasts who automatically cancel each other out in a two-per country situation while leaving home legitimate medal contenders in other events."
956,2020-07-21 18:11:16,hv2a3s,"She seems like she's made of steel, but she has been training nonstop for like 20 years. If she throws a big skill with bad enough execution she's going to end up injured. There's definitely a balance that I think she struggles with."
957,2020-07-21 19:08:52,hv2a3s,"""Jade emerged in 2017, and in 2018 shortly after Worlds, she proceeded to lock up the mathematically unbeatable World Cup qualifying score for VT/FX before Myk and her coaches probably even got a chance to read the rules in detail (she was competing in NCAA at the time). ""

There is nothing to stop Mykayla having been named to Worlds teams, and yet I would note that Jade has two Worlds vault silvers and one floor silver. Mykayla has a 2014 vault bronze. Jade also beat Mykayla on floor and vault at 2019 US Nationals and Worlds Selection Camp. Jade was fortunate to be able to take advantage of the qualifying procedure but she is also winning more. If the extra qualifying procedure didn't exist and I were picking between them I would pick Jade."
958,2020-07-21 19:34:37,hv2a3s,"u/sr0570 Mykayla has two issues in the way of her spot on the team: on vault, her Cheng is currently the second best eligible vault for TF behind Simone Biles and is an advantage over others, but her Amanar is rough and even it it improves will not have the aerodynamics of Carey to compete for EF. Therefore it’s mainly only useful for a team final argument, and the chances of a Cheng from either Grace or Leanne or an Amanar from Shilese or Jordan are pretty good. Myk has to pray none of these AAers get a top-level vault because if so her edge is gone.

The other problem for her is that her perceived “edge” on FX from her high D-score doesn’t exist like you said because of execution. I don’t need to get into that further.

I will say that these are the routines that I think are more feasible for her while still setting herself up well:

Vault: Cheng (6.0) + DTY (5.4). Her Cheng stuck can probably score 15.1 domestically, DTY maybe 14.7

Bars: I don’t think the Bhardwaj out of the hip 1/1 would work well because she doesn’t finish the pirouette early enough and the Bhardwaj should be early so her form is as good as possible. If she put it in front of the Fabrichnova though she’d get .1 CV (aka the same boost as adding the triple double) and the finishing position wouldn’t matter:

Weiler 1/2 + Shap + Bhardwaj // Maloney + Tkatchev // Church // Cast 1/2 + Hip 1/1 + Fabrichnova

Total = 6.2

Beam: I love the Tuck Jump 1/2 but that switch + BHS 1/1 + Straight 1/1 is not happening! I doubt even Wevers could connect a full twisting leap out of her Kochetkova and hers is one of the best. However I think the Straight 1/1 and tuck 1/1 being D from side position are perfect for Mykayla:

Candle Mount // Tuck Jump 1/2 + BHS + Tuck 1/1 // Side Aerial + Split + Straddle // Front Tuck // Stretched jump 1/1 from side position // Tuck jump 1/1 from side position // L-turn // RO + Full-In

Total = 6.3

Floor: I don’t want her doing the triple double because she doesn’t have room on the Silivas. I also don’t think the Gomez is feasible and would give her fallout deductions. She should count the L-hop full instead since it’s a C and she usually gets it around:

3/2 + 3/1 + Front Tuck // Silivas // 2.5 + Front Pike // Full-In // L-Hop + Switch 1/2 // Double Wolf

Total = 6.0

Overall this is a 24.5 D-score program which would still be the second highest in the country (Lee is going to be 23.7 - 24.3 range) unless McCallum adds the Cheng too."
959,2020-07-21 06:46:47,hv2a3s,"I honestly believe she has been working on improving her form especially looking at her latest bars video.  Her bars has improved so much.  But I honestly agree she needs to work the code of points to the best of her ability, especially on beam.  For her, I honestly think she needs to work both difficulty and consistency.  For her, she needs to focus more on her tumbling and power instead of her dance."
960,2020-07-21 08:31:31,hv2a3s,She has no chance. I don’t even think she’ll make alternate. Her skills are big but her e scores kill any lead the d scores give her.
961,2020-07-22 00:56:16,hv2a3s,"This is one of those things shes going to or she wont, we really have zero influence. She will do this and make it or she will pursue it and break her fucking ankle, or something else completely, regardless it will be interesting."
962,2020-07-21 09:48:19,hv2a3s,"Vault: 
- 1st vault: Cheng (6.0) - putting two hands on the table will make it clear to the judges that she has improved. Her Cheng is also way more consistent than the Amanar landings wise.
- 2nd vault: Amanar (5.8) - less consistent landing

Bars: no Ray, Pak, or Van Leeuwen. Free hip 1/1 in between Shap + Tkatchev because that currently gets her amplitude deductions. The full downswing from the free hip 1/1 would allow her Tkatchev to get more air, thus also making the Bhardwsj connection more doable.
- Weiler 1/2 (D) + Maloney (D) + Free hip 1/1 (D) + Tkatchev (D) + Bhardwaj (E) = 0.6 CV
- Shaposhnikova (D) + Bail (D) + Toe shoot (B) = 0.1 CV
- Fabrichnova (F)
- FEDDDDDD(3.5) + 0.7 CV + 2.0 CR = 6.2 SV

Beam: no stepouts, turning jumps, more splits than nescessary. Any even remotely unrealistic connections were removed. The routine below is very efficient imo and plays to her strengths. I also got rid of the candle because hers doesn’t look good due to the lack in shoulder mobility.
- 2 foot BHS (B) + 2 foot BHS (B) + Back tuck 1/1 (F) = 0.3 CV
- Switch split (C) + Split jump (B) + Korbut (B) = 0.1 CV
- Side aerial (D) + Back tuck (C) = 0.2 CV
- front tuck (D)
- L turn (C) + full turn (A) = 0.1 CV
- Roundoff (B) + Full in (G) = 0.2 CV
- GFDDCCCB(3.2) + 0.9 CV + 2.0 CR = 6.1 SV

Floor: she’s a really good twister so I decided to utilize that and got rid of the Moors which will never be worth it. She shouldn’t even be thinking of doing a triple double. Not worth doing any D leaps for an extra tenth that will either get grilled on E or not credited. She should focus on looking as clean and precise in her dance as possible.
- Whip (A) + Full in (E) = 0.2 CV
- double bent leg above horizontal turn (D)
- 1.5 stepout (C) + triple full (E) + front tuck (A) = 0.4 CV
- switch split (B) + L hop 1/1 (C)
- Silivas (H)
- Double wolf turn (D)
- 2.5 twist (D) + front pike (A) = 0.1 CV - thought about a front full here but it’s not worth the extra tenth for the deductions and added fall risk.
- HEEDDDCC(3.6) + 0.7 CV + 2.0 CR = 6.3 SV

AA Programme: 6.0 VT + 6.2 UB + 6.1 BB + 6.3 FX = 24.6 AA"
963,2020-07-26 00:34:47,hv2a3s,Does Laurie not count as a Martha-era gymnast?
964,2020-07-21 10:16:22,hv2a3s,"Exactly. Some gymnasts post decent scores with a low difficulty and clean execution. While Mykayla does have a high difficulty, her execution, especially on floor is botched. Take the 2014 worlds floor final for example, Mustafina literally snatched the medal from underneath Skinner with only 3 passes, her best being whip+whip+double Arabian while Skinner did a Moors among others. Had Skinner had a slightly better execution, this would not have been possible.


Also, Biles is invincible on Vault and Floor not only because of her crazy difficulty, but a far superior execution. Most gymnasts can't score on execution on par with her, even when they're doing less difficult skills.


I believe there are only so many difficult skills Mykayla can put in a routine, but her scores can really have a significant improvement if she works on her execution.


And it's so good to see your username after Mostepanova."
965,2020-07-22 00:32:42,hv2a3s,"There was an interview kinda recently with her coach that said (in a nutshell) that she would probably quit if they didn’t let her throw those difficult skills like Biles does. I just hope that she doesn’t expect to make the team with just difficulty and poor form. She really cleaned it up in NCAA but honestly there was still so much to be desired. I never see her point her toes, she has no flexibility, knees constantly bent. It all adds up over time and it makes those insane skills so much less desirable to watch. Watching Biles do them is just incredible, watching MyKayla replicate them sometimes looks like watching a wet rag in comparison. The fact that she can execute them is incredible and I won’t deny how much her comeback amazes me, but realistically, all of her baseline technique/skills are lacking in ways that are shooting her chances of making the team to hell. 

She has a year left, so who knows what she can pull off in that time. I won’t write her off yet and I don’t think anyone should but realistically from where she’s at now and given the things she consistently struggles with, she has a lot of work to do before trials."
966,2020-07-21 14:22:21,hv2a3s,"I would agree with this. Myk has always been doing difficult skills but her execution leaves a lot to be desired. Directly compare and contrast that with 2011/2012 Kyla Ross, who was doing less difficult routines but that shit was consistent, and her execution was always excellent. In a regular year I think it's more lucrative to do easier skills perfectly, than difficult skills haphazardly. HOWEVER, with the depth of the US girls, the 4 person team, Simone Biles still being queen of the universe, AND the missed 2016 team looming over her head...I don't think Myk has any room to half-ass it. It's go big, or literally...stay home. I think she not only has to train big big skills, but execute them flawlessly. I'm not saying it can't happen and I want NOTHING but the best for her, because if I have to watch her smile with tears in her eyes to the cameras, while confetti rains down around her again I think I will lose it. It's only July, there's time to get better. But not as much time as there was yesterday ;) Better werk bitch."
967,2020-07-23 03:26:02,hv2a3s,"I would argue Myk is the epitome of being able to do extreme difficulty without the technique, year after year. This is her strength, and I'm saying, Myk should make her case for 2021 by **doing what only she can do.**"
968,2020-07-21 08:32:01,hv2a3s,"I think that Mykayla's execution deductions and complaints fall down to the specific, strange choices in her routine composition chosen by her coaches. Most of her BB grievances come from doing a Switch 1/2 (D) or Side Split 1/2 (D) or a shaky Wolf Turn (D) or a Stretched Jump 1/2 (D) or a Side Straddle 1/2 (D), keep in mind she's also doing some of these simpler skills with bent knees, like the Split (B), Straddle (B), Switch (C), Sissone (A), Wolf Jump (A), Wolf Spin (B/D) or L-turn (C). these are all risky D skills or flaws basics that she intends to use for her D-score and requirements, but in reality, she is capable of nailing so many C skills like a Full L-turn (C) or a Stretched 1/1 Jump (C) or (B) and (A) to achieve the same difficulty and requirements... If she needs easy dance skills for +0.1 Mixed Series on Beam, she could add a Stretch 1/2 Jump (B) or a Tucked 1/2 Jump (C) or a Tucked 1/2 Jump (B) or a Wolf Jump 1/2 (B) or a Pike Jump 1/2 (B), you get the point...."
969,2020-07-21 11:25:21,hv2a3s,Hmmmm she definitely has a chance on making the team... I mean it’s going to be a really tough but she has a real shot.
970,2020-07-21 08:38:27,hv2a3s,"I'm saying her AA program can be trimmed and adjusted strategically if she uses her time to up the difficulty on only her best skills to create potential ""Skinner"" named skills, while cutting other skills and replacing them with new, simpler B/C dance elements like the tuck/stretched jumps so she can still count C skills and get the mixed-series CV without using dance elements that require 180-split and cause her so much grief."
971,2020-07-22 01:05:14,hv2a3s,"> Some gymnasts post decent scores with a low difficulty and clean execution.

Nina Derwael made it to the floor final and top 5 of All Around with two floor passes and a single-twisting yurchenko."
972,2020-07-21 14:18:53,hv2a3s,Musty snatched that medal but the gymternet went **crazy** when it happened and many people believe she didn’t deserve it *because* it was so damn easy and hugely overscored.
973,2020-07-21 14:43:00,hv2a3s,"I agree. She already has a lot of difficult skills under her belt, if she just improves on their execution, she can post scores on par and even better than others. But last I checked, she's thinking about doing triple double on bars and floor, even has a YouTube video doing it on bars, so she is really going for Simone level difficulty I think, I may be wrong though."
974,2020-07-24 17:09:56,hv2a3s,No thank you. I don't particularly care for fugly gymnastics that's  unnecessarily endangering the gymnast all for the sake of D-Score. That's the shittiest version of gymnastics possible.
975,2020-07-21 14:36:40,hv2a3s,"Right. People love to say one gymnast is underscored/overscored if the results don't come in as per their wishes. I've watched that final multiple times and I always find an extra tenth to take off on Mykayla's execution. That Moors got deducted on so much that it wasn't even worth doing it. And really, people should read the d-score chart before commenting what's difficult and what's not. I mean, isn't judging how difficult a routine is the purpose of having a d-score in the first place? Then they should try doing 2 triple Y spins in one routine."
976,2020-07-21 14:47:40,hv2a3s,"That's what it looks like based on that youtube video with the triple double. I think that's a misstep though. She'll never get the execution down before trials so better to work on skills she already has under her belt, and perfect them. Like other people here were saying, the US powers that be have been harping on her execution for literally years now. She needs to show that she's listening (which, to be fair, I think she is. But whether she's improved enough is still TBD..)"

Also, I don't think Simone really front tumbles. She's more of a back tumbler. Her BHS is soooooo good, I think she gets her power from that."

985,2020-07-19 01:49:36,htcqkq,Why would you have the gymnast do an immediate back tuck or backhandspring? Those wouldn't get any kind of bonus. Not to mention constraints like floor size and the limits of the human body.

990,2020-07-19 02:49:17,htcqkq,"Also the whole post was inspired by a video of Simone training a double layout punch double back. And most of the passes have been competed (in variation- but same amount of acro per pass) which is where I find the ""justification""."
991,2020-07-19 02:53:00,htcqkq,"That was on rod floor. And would actually give bonus vs a single back tuck or a BHS out of bounds.

999,2020-07-15 17:14:14,hrpnvt,"Most of Simone’s success has to with **Simone herself**. Not only is she incredibly naturally gifted, she is extremely dedicated, hardworking, and passionate. Those things combined are what brought Simone to success. 

It’s so incredibly easy to be a good coach when you’ve got the perfect athlete. 

For coaches, I would 100% look to the model of Aimee’s coaching style of freedom to choose (re: food, training hours, family vacations, etc), positive reinforcement, fostering an atmosphere of safety, and putting an athlete’s well-being on top of a priority list. But I hope coaches don’t just expect success akin to Simone’s to blossom just from that alone. She is truly a once-in-a-lifetime type athlete. And it can become frustrating for coaches if they put in all of that behavior/coaching change and not see Simone-level success. 

I hope coaches change but I also hope they change not because “you don’t have to be an asshole to create an Olympic champion” but because they know it’s better for an athletes overall well-being, both in the short term and lifelong, to just not be an asshole as a coach regardless of the level of success that comes (or doesn’t come) to each of their athletes."
1000,2020-07-15 15:45:32,hrpnvt,"Not sure if this has been posted yet, but I thought it was a very interesting article with several different people submitting quotes.

I am giving Aimee more leeway than I did before. Sure, the article probably skews towards painting her in the best light, but I think for the most part it seems accurate.

Before, I was annoyed and disappointed from her lack of speaking out against her co-coaches on the national team, but after reading this article, I realized what position she was in.

1) She did a really great job of protecting Simone as much as possible even though she wasn't able to protect Simone from Nassar. It does seem like Aimee was able to protect Simone from Marta's abuse as much as possible. 

2) The dynamic between Simone, Aimee, and Marta is about what I expected. Aimee knew Simone wouldn't put up with Marta's usually bullshit, so she kept her away as much as possible. Then, when Simone was winning AA titles at the top elite competitions, then Marta couldn't keep her off the team regardless of how little control she had over Simone. I mean, if Simone is beating everyone on the national team, how can you justify keeping her off the team? 

3) Aimee let Simone do a lot of little things that seemed small, but looking at the reactions from other gymnasts, it's clear that posting a picture eating pizza was a big deal to them. I didn't realize this as it happened. 

4) It would have been very difficult for Aimee to criticize other coaches as her athlete was on the team with those athletes and coaches. It would have politicized Simone's career and created a lot more problems for Simone. So, now, I kind of get Aimee's silence at the time. It sucks, but Aimee was one person in a corrupt and abusive culture. 

5) What about now? Why doesn't Aimee talk about some of the more abusive stuff she has witnessed? This is a good and fair question. And I don't know what the answer is. This is why I am not taking Aimee completely off the hook. She isn't involved in the national team and doesn't really seem to be interested in getting back in, so what is holding her back? 

 Maybe she is waiting until Simone retires because if Aimee comes out hard against a fellow coach, it would definitely create problems for Simone. It would put pressure on Simone to comment and/or confirm Aimee's allegations. 

5) Aimee's relationship with Maggie Haney is the most problematic. Did she see any abuse? If so, what exactly? And if she did see the abuse, why was she so buddy buddy with Maggie? 

Again, the only way I will give her a pass is if Aimee waits until after the next Olympics when both Simone and Laurie are retired and then she comes out and confirms what happened to Laurie.

6) It's so satisfying that the greatest gymnast in the history of the sport accomplished everything IN SPITE OF what Marta told her to do. Marta's ""greatest gymnast"" owes very little to Marta's coaching and direction. I hope this is a lesson to every elite coach in the world that you don't have to be an asshole to create an Olympic champion. 

7) The more I find out about Simone's parents, the more I like them. Seem like great people all over."
1001,2020-07-15 19:52:27,hrpnvt,">	Martha did not care for that because if Martha said jump, you’re supposed to say how high, and Simone was not playing the game at that time.


This made me smile. She is the greatest of all time because of herself. She knew what she wanted and wasn’t going to let just anyone ruin it."
1002,2020-07-15 23:48:22,hrpnvt,"Thanks for sharing, this was super interesting to read. I’m newer to following gymnastics very closely, would anyone be willing to share why Simone switched coaches? Aimee seems like she was a real advocate as much as she could be under such a terrible system"
1003,2020-07-16 14:24:08,hrpnvt,"Part of the reason why Marta could get away with so much negative coaching is that the United States has enough depth that they can just treat almost every gymnast like they're replaceable. there were times when Marta would just literally start talking up some random athlete and claim that they were going to do well as a way of motivating the higher scoring athletes to work harder and not take anything for granted.

We saw that the Romanian federation would often do the same thing and it ended up biting them in the ass when they ran out of senior athletes."
1004,2020-07-15 22:36:48,hrpnvt,"Exactly - this is the right approach to coaching because it's the right way to treat young athletes *even if* it means lower achievement.

I do wonder how many other ""Simones"" we never saw because they quit after being treated like shit by coaches."
1005,2020-07-16 04:59:03,hrpnvt,"> Most of Simone’s success has to with Simone herself. Not only is she incredibly naturally gifted, she is extremely dedicated, hardworking, and passionate. Those things combined are what brought Simone to success. 

I'd like to point it's a bit of both. Yes, Simone is all that. She's incredibly talented and works her ass of. But at the same time, she's incredibly fortunate to be in circumstances where all that can give results. 

She's in a country with an up and growing gymnastics scene, she has a very supportive network and a coach that had the right style to let her be her best self. 

If Simone had grown up in another country or if her family/coaching circumstances had been different, we might not have seen all we have seen from here. 

Just as any conversation about privilege, the fact that you're privileged doesn't meen that you don't work your ass off. It just means that you get more and better opportunities, so working your ass of pays more."
1006,2020-07-15 17:15:46,hrpnvt,"I think it’s just plain truth that nobody’s response to a systematic culture of abuse is perfect. It’s remarkable to be able to stand up to it at all, as most people just get tangled up within it, no matter your values or how „good“ a person you are. If everyone and everything around you signals that this is normal and the way to go, you’ll succumb to it. 
As this is, I think the matter of fact is just that Aimee became friends with a lot of the other coaches. This also makes sense when you take into account that Martha was the prime bully. People tend to stick together and form strong bonds in the face of adversity, sometimes overlooking blatant faults in one another’s character. I’m not expecting Aimee to speak out more than she already has after Simones career is over, unless something triggers it. I just think - as with everyone - she did some pretty great things but also wasn’t perfect. 
(And sadly the fact she wasn’t had dire consequences for some kids.)"
1007,2020-07-15 20:03:59,hrpnvt,"I don't think Aimee really needs to ""confirm"" the abuse even after Simone and Laurie retire - I think it sends a really powerful message for the gymnasts to speak up for themselves and not have a 3rd party coach play a role in verifying the truth to those allegations."
1008,2020-07-16 00:16:57,hrpnvt,"Being an elite coach is a serious drain on your personal life - Aimee wanted to be able to be family first after Rio, so her husband could take a job in Florida (which is how she ended up coaching at EVO).

Afaik, there is no bad blood between Simone and Aimee; and Simone respected that decision."
1009,2020-07-16 17:39:37,hrpnvt,"Agreed. The US dominance is much more due to the fact of how many quality athletes we have and not nearly as much to Marta. 

I just listened to the ESPN Podcast series on the Karolyi's and it wasn't even Marta's idea to go to a monthly camp system. USAG made that decision before the 2000 Olympics and hired Bela to first run it, who then completely botched it.

Marta was chosen after the 2000 Olympics, but it wasn't her idea. USAG was always going to do the camp system, they just had to find the new director. 

Marta is so overrated, it drives me crazy. Her and Bela were great at self-promotion and taking credit for everything that went right, but always blamed the athletes when it went wrong.

Marta did the same thing with Nassar. She claimed that ""I was never in charge of the camps, it was USAG who ran them"". Fucking bullshit. 

I hope she rots in hell."
1010,2020-07-16 01:49:58,hrpnvt,That thought literally keeps me up at night!!!
1011,2020-07-16 14:20:19,hrpnvt,"Cecile in Laurent have said that just because she's incredibly talented doesn't mean she doesn't have the same issues of other gymnasts such having to do conditioning and reps and working through fear or having an off day. 

I would also argue that while Simone is incredibly talented I think a lot of her ability to score well has also come from having great form and technique. her technique on being especially with her layout step out layout step out series shows incredible technique"
1012,2020-07-15 22:42:22,hrpnvt,"Good point. I think the issue is that is with Aimee and other coaches is the lack of intervening when they witness the abuse. That's probably more of what I would like her and other coaches to talk about. 

A big part of the problem is the free rein elite coaches are given to their athletes, they seem to care little about hiding the abuse since no one will say anything. The athletes are deathly afraid of saying anything, the other coaches refuse to stop abusive coaches, and the parents are not allowed to watch practice. So who exactly is sticking up for the athletes? 

That's really what I want her to talk about. How do we prevent coaching abuse if other coaches are complicit and parents aren't allowed to see anything?"
1013,2020-07-16 07:44:40,hrpnvt,"I also got the impression that aimee had no intention of coaching elite, she just found herself with an amazingly gifted kid."
1014,2020-07-16 14:32:20,hrpnvt,"Yeah, as I said, she does work her ass of. But we shouldn't ignore the fact that she's also in circumstances where that work can give the best results. 

If you look at gymnasts from other countries you can see the difference. I wouldn't say, for example, that Dipa Karmakar works any less harder than Simone, but she is in a country with almost no gymnastics traditions, with more precarious infrastructure and less medical care. 

Or Oleg Verniaiev. Half of his work is simply making sure that he can have enough funds to continue training, and that forces him to continue training and competing even if he risks burning out. 

I'm not discounting Simone's talent and hard work. She's uniquely talented and incredibly hard working. Just pointing how circumstances allow for all of it to yield results. 

A comment further down pointed it. How many gymnasts with the same potential we've never seen because they got in bad circumstances and quit?"
1015,2020-07-16 08:00:46,hrpnvt,">Good point. I think the issue is that is with Aimee and other coaches is the lack of intervening when they witness the abuse. That's probably more of what I would like her and other coaches to talk about. 
>

I honestly think aimee and the other good ones did what they could at the time. The whole system was rotten inside out with a culture where abuse and predators were protected for decades. It's easy to see what's wrong as an outsider looking in but when you're  part of that culture, willingly or not, the lines start to blur. Abuse gets normalised and as a coach you wouldn't want to risk your kids career by speaking up and end up on Martha's shit list.

There's a video on YouTube where cassie rice talks about elite coaching and how she was accused of being to soft her gymnasts. At camps she'd lie and say tasha had already done the ridiculously high number of sets when in fact she hadn't to protect her for injury. It's super interesting. She talks about a former Romanian gymnasts, now a coach at her gym, who still to this day has a hard time talking about the abuse s/he suffered through in Romania."
1016,2020-07-16 17:06:38,hrpnvt,"Well the other way you can look at that circumstances is the fact that she had a mother who was a drug addict and an father and was in the foster care system. If she had not been adopted by her grandparents she likely would not have had the family support system and money to go to gymnastics.

I remember I had a student who taught himself how to throw a backhand spring and did a perfect back handspring on wood. He had really strong technique for being self-taught and I always wish I could have given him the opportunity to go to gymnastics or tumbling classes."

1030,2020-09-05 15:09:24,iml3ru,"I did not understand this until I moved to a southern US state. Before I had always recommended to my patients that swimming was excellent exercise for losing weight. When I started practicing in the south I realized for the first time that many black people do not know how to swim - not because they were lazy or incompetent or scaredy cats. 

This story was told to me by a white doctor in his 60s. He said that when he was a child there was a swimming pool in his neighborhood and so all the white kids grew up swimming in it and learned how to swim, no problem. No black kids allowed. The black kids had to brave the nearby river if they wanted to learn to swim, and obviously nobody was going to do that. Then new laws were passed that said ok you have to let black people into the pool. Fine. So the owners put up a new rule that says black people are only allowed into the pool on Wednesdays, and Thursdays the pool is closed for cleaning. 

How many black people do you think showed up on Wednesdays?

For me there are two takeaways from this story: 1) people who don’t know this sort of history will read something vaguely racist about a black person not being able to swim and go 🤷‍♀️ people are just overreacting and making shit up, etc etc. We need to know this history. And 2) this is not ancient history. This was not that long ago. Those black kids, those black parents who watched their kids go through this and went through it themselves, are very much alive today."

1068,2020-09-03 06:26:57,ilj3j1,Sure but how exactly is that relevant here?
1069,2020-09-03 00:31:54,ilj3j1,I don’t know either. I laugh whenever someone says “gay people choose to be gay” because I wish I could make myself fully gay almost daily

1071,2020-09-04 05:03:02,ilj3j1,I'm not sure they actually do? I don't think there's a very definitive answer either way as far as I'm aware due to the difficulty with researching it. A lot of the people who I know that push that narrative are pretty sus alt right types too.
1072,2020-09-03 11:44:32,ilj3j1,"Not the one you're responding to but because you're basically bashing all straight relationships/people?



This isn't solely on you but the whole ""Wow thank god I'm a lesbian"" comments on all these posts aren't exactly supportive. You presumably wouldn't enjoy ""Thank fuck I'm hetero"" comments if any problem faced by the gay community (like for instance the high incidence of abuse among lesbian couples) came up."
1073,2020-09-03 00:33:31,ilj3j1,Exactly! Straight women are proof that you can’t choose who you’re attracted to :(

1076,2020-09-03 01:23:38,ilj3j1,This has been my argument forever. If people could choose to be gay there’d be so few straight women the survival of the species would be in doubt.

1087,2020-09-03 14:08:06,ilj3j1,"I'm honestly so fucking tired of hetero people playing the ""you're attacking me"" bullshit on things that are very obviously not attacking them, it's just as cringy as men making everything about them, and white people making everything about them.

Cut it the fuck out."
1088,2020-09-03 14:29:36,ilj3j1,"I can understand that feeling and being tired as I am neither male nor white. 

I think on other subs, you can jump straight to the shut the fuck up. But on here, I give people the benefit of the doubt because most people here are trying to explore and progress. My comment was in good faith and the person who replied to mine was building on that. To be fair, my comment wasn’t about Heteros, it was about lesbian relationships."
1089,2020-09-03 14:34:23,ilj3j1,"Of which you jumped straight to bigoted talking points, hence my immediate annoyance. 

""Don't lesbians have more abusive relationships?"" Comes off, to me, nothing different than someone asking ""Don't black people commit most of the crime?"" when attempting to justify their racism. It doesn't sound to be in good faith, and to be fair, feminist subs don't get a reprieve from me. Terfs and white feminists still exist, and considering feminist spaces should be safe for lgbtq+ folks, they sometimes arent. Homophobic people still exist, and the whole ""what about the straights?"" Is really fucking triggering to see, you should know that by now.

So yeah, I do think my reaction was justified."
1090,2020-09-03 14:39:04,ilj3j1,"When you replied to my comment, I immediately though of the black people more crimes thing! It’s like in the makeup subs, when it’s about the lack of dark shades, a pale person says, “well what about the other end of the spectrum??” Again, I see that I should have spent more time on the comment to accurately portray the discussion I was hoping to have. But sure, I can certainly identify with being triggered. I am sorry that my comment caused this bad feeling for you. It does appear to be in bad faith and I will do better next time!"
1091,2020-09-04 05:07:29,ilj3j1,What discussion were you hoping to have? Cause I'm not sure how you read that any other way.
1092,2020-09-06 08:11:08,ilj3j1,Some discussion from people in lesbian relationships?
1093,2020-09-06 16:48:47,ilj3j1,"Alright let’s play that out. I’m in a sapphic relationship and we’re rapidly approaching our one year anniversary and neither of us has abused the other or committed dv.

Where do you want to go from here? What conversation can you build from that? I’m very curious."
1094,2020-09-09 16:33:56,ilj3j1,"Are you friends with any other women that are not in a heterosexual relationship? What do they report? Have you ever experienced DV? Are you in any support groups for mental illness or trauma? Are there women who are not cis het who have shared their experience with the group? Like if someone asked about DV, I would share not only my experience but what my friend’s experiences have been, my family’s, and the general culture around me. 

Edit: added last sentence"
1095,2020-09-11 00:06:54,ilj3j1,"I am they don’t report any either and it’s not part of the general culture. All of that means nothing though. You cannot speak to a trend with annecdotes positive or negative. And that’s all this is. 

So again, what sort of conversation were you looking to have?"
1096,2020-09-13 04:41:31,ilj3j1,"Well none on your end, apparently! 


In my world, I had a roommate who was AMAB but was transitioning to female. She was in a long term relationship with a lesbian woman but they were also polyamourous with other women. My roommate met and wanted to pursue a relationship with a person who was AMAB but identified as non-binary and pansexual. But my roommate’s long term partner thought the person was too male and that my roommates attraction to them was contrary to their boundaries or something. Anyway she became abusive and would do her best to make my roommate cry and doubt herself. She was terrible and I was so glad when they broke up. 


I myself am a heterosexual woman. But my first sexual experience (molestation) was two kids at school, a brother and sister who were maybe two grades apart. I was 8. The sister was the older one and could write better so she would write letters to me that her brother dictated. Long really scary violent letters. She would lead me into the girls bathroom and then her brother would come in. I remember bits and pieces but I clearly remember still wanting to be their friends... I looked up to her. Eventually one of their notes was found and police came to my school to interrogate me. They were expelled. 


After that this same stalled/bully/abuser situation kept occurring. I changed schools more than 5 times between age 9 and 13. Yet it kept happening. Always with males as the perpetrators. 


Sometimes I am get overwhelmed with the patriarchy, the male gaze, rape culture, gender inequality...I feel like women are the only sane people on this earth. But every once in awhile I remember that I was sexually abused by a girl. Makes me feel some type of way, I’m not sure exactly how though. I am a member to a sexual abuse support thread on reddit. I have users I chat with that identify as lesbian but have had both male and female abusers. 


Anyway, maybe you don’t think there is a conversation to be had about abuse in female relationships. And that’s okay. However, a few min of google showed that there have been studies on this type of domestic abuse and that it is real but vastly underreported. 


This is from Wikipedia : 

*The issue of domestic violence among lesbian couples may be underreported due to the social construction of gender roles that women are expected to play in society; violence perpetrated by women may be ignored due to beliefs that the male social construction itself is a primary source of violence.[9] The social construction of women is characterized as passive, dependent, nurturing, and highly emotional, and the social construction of men is characterized as competitive, aggressive, strong, and even prone to violence. Due to forms of discrimination, homophobia, and heterosexism, and the belief that heterosexuality is normative within society, domestic violence has been characterized as being between the male perpetrator and the female victim.[4] This contributes to the invisibility of all domestic violence perpetrated by women. Further, the fear of reinforcing negative stereotypes could lead some community members, activists, and victims to deny the extent of violence among lesbians.[10] Social service agencies are often unwilling to assist victims of domestic violence perpetrated by women.[10] Victims of domestic violence in lesbian relationships are less likely to have the case prosecuted within a legal system.[5]*

I’ve never made a reddit post but I wonder if there is anyone on this sub who would want to talk about this?"
1097,2020-09-13 04:50:26,ilj3j1,"I don’t think there’s a conversation to be had with *you* quite frankly. Maybe someone else.

The same Wikipedia article has stats that show lower than average, higher than average and the same and specifically makes the point that much more research on this issue is needed to say definitively where the numbers lie. I don’t know how you pull just that section out of context unless you’re coming here with an agenda and that makes me think you’re sea lioning.

Edit: I’m not gonna go through all of those other studies and am just going to call it here because quite honestly, I don’t trust you to come at this in good faith and disproving all of that is a ton of work."

Makes all generations 18-19 years is very balanced, compared to making it very short as 15-16 or less years or making it very long like 21-22+ years. It makes things easier for everyone else instead of all this confusion. But at the same time, this is all arbitrary. I know that we are not really millennials at the end of the day, especially based on how society views millennials and such, but maybe being a millennial is different to another person.

I mean it is very likely a three or four year old would not remember the political importance of these events. They may not even know who this Kennedy is until like years after he died. 1961 might have memories prior to Kennedy's death.  I am sure many 1959 and 1960 borns would not remember Kennedy's death. Many 1995-1998 dont even remember 9/11. 2015-2017 though can end up remembering a world before coronavirus 15 years from now, even though they may not know what coronavirus is.

Boomer: 1946-1964
Gen X: 1965-1983
Gen Y: 1984-2002
Gen Z: 2003-2021

It's this:
Boomer: 1942-1960
Gen X: 1961-1979
Gen Y: 1980-1998
Gen Z: 1999-2017"
1117,2020-09-01 07:58:57,ikfnvk,"The 1961-1979 and 1980-1998 definitions aren't that uncommon actually. Many people want to begin gen y at 1980 since it's the first 80s year, so whenever they also apply the 18 year span, it ends up being 1980-1998. You barely ever see 1942-1960 and 1999-2017 though."
1118,2020-09-01 08:09:10,ikfnvk,"I prefer the ranges next to: instead of this rather than its this. Makes no sense for 1960 to be gatekept from the other two early 60s years. You even said 1980 should be start of millennials since it is the first 80s year. First half of the 60s is gen jones anyways. 

I have seen 1945-1959 as a baby boomer definition. 

Then 1960-1979. 

1980-1999 is one of the most agreeable millennial definitions I have come across. It is my favorite actually. 

I am not keen on when Gen Z ends though.

I have seen 1998-2016. Never 1999-2017 though. People would prefer stating X in 1960 if 1964 or 1965 is too late, since the first three years of the 60s are the full early 60s years, just like how you said 1980 should be y as it is the first 80s year. People prefer 1982 over 1980 as the millennial start date though."
1120,2020-09-01 08:01:55,ikfnvk,"First of all, I have never seen 1961-1979 and I seen 1942-1960, with the exception of 1942, so 1943-1960. I have seen 1980-1998 (though I feel that most start Y in 1980 cause it is the first 80s year like ending it in 1994 or 1999 for the same numerical reason. I have seen 1999-2017 in a way, maybe excluding 2017, so 1999-2016."

It's why I can't get behind increasing artistry deductions even if I'd want that in a vacuum."
1140,2020-08-30 19:01:20,ijh1ke,The fact that two judges gave 0.2 deductions for [Pauline Schaefer's FX routine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kbp8vKsdcvU) is ridiculous to me. Like how was this routine not artistic enough..
1141,2020-08-30 18:03:17,ijh1ke,"While this is interesting, the fact that you’re using this to just shit on Aly isn’t cool. Artistry isn’t simply defined by what your body looks like while a leg is straightened or toes are pointed. It incorporates expression, rhythm, sense of pride/“attacking” the event, and the overall performance. Yes, Aly doesn’t necessarily have the cleanest lines and likely isn’t the most flexible, but I love her performance and clearly the judges do as well. Not liking her style isn’t a reason for deduction."
1142,2020-08-30 21:00:30,ijh1ke,This is why we need an A score out of 1 or 2 points separate from E score. Way more transparent and it's not harder for the judges since they're still doing the same tallying.
1143,2020-08-31 06:32:25,ijh1ke,"Okay.  Why did all judges deduct from Celine Van Gerner?  I know I have talked about her Cats routine, but her 2016 floor routine was freaking amazing.  It wasn't the stereotypical American robots or ballet.  It was based on actual modern dance.

I still don't get the Laurie Hernandez artistry phase.  She definitely showed potential, but horrible choreo and a lack of dance training kind of get me off.  I really don't see anything artistic about her beam.

I was going to question Simone, but I looked back from 2016 and I felt like that was a decent routine artistic wise.  Her routines in this quad I feel like they lack IN ARTISTRY compared to their previous quad.  I was also really impressed by Simone's wolf turns, and how they just don't feel like they are out of place.  Although 2019, her wolf turns kind of fell flat in her routine."
1144,2020-09-09 19:29:48,ijh1ke,"I actually think Aly’s routine is brilliantly arranged. She isn’t the best dancer, and she doesn’t bring the drama, but the music edit is paced so well, and slow pretty part is in the corner break. Everything she does illustrates the music we are hearing. It’s brilliant. The music carries her through it. It has ups downs and phrases and the construction of her skills fit logically. So even though she isn’t giving you Balanchine realness, she is doing what she can do very clean and each move is with the music. I mean, she lands her DLO on the orchestra hit of the edit and it brings the house down. We see a lot of beautiful dancers doing beautiful turns but there is no sense of tempo or no musical cue that asks for it. You know what I mean? But ET always has well constructed routines and I like her style. And I’ve said it a million times but Brooklyn Moors “Saxophone Angel Fantasy” (my name for it) is absolutely brilliant and I can’t even begin to stress who ground breaking that piece is."
1145,2020-09-03 03:34:55,ijh1ke,"While these data are interesting to analyze, I'm confused how it was obtained.   
Aren't artistry deductions part of the E score, and aren't E score breakdowns completely available to the public? Or am I mistaken?

Without a verified source, I find this whole discussion to be hypothetical."
1146,2020-08-30 20:02:59,ijh1ke,I’m more surprised that someone gave zero artistry deductions to Seda Tutkhalyan. Not to hate on her too much because she did finally hit and come through big time for Russia in the TF but really?
1147,2020-08-30 18:26:32,ijh1ke,IIRC the whole thing was brought up to highlight national bias. It was particularly alarming to see the two asian programs receive the most deductions.
1148,2020-08-30 18:26:13,ijh1ke,"Aly is a 3 time olympic champion and 6 time olympic medalist, I think she's proved that she's an amazing gymnast. But with that being said, Aly's beam (her rhythm and choreography) is objectively not artistic enough to get 0 deductions when others are getting deducted for more artistic performances. No one is shitting on her, we all know she's an incredible athlete, but it is absolutely ridiculous that she doesn't get any artistry deductions."
1149,2020-08-30 18:10:31,ijh1ke,"Nobody is trying to shit on Aly.  She happens to be one of my fave gymnasts, I’ve been a huge fan of hers since watching her compete in person at the 2009 Visas.  I also said nothing about body type - Produnova is a great example of someone with a powerful build but also extremely artistic.  It’s just factual that Aly’s performances on beam and floor warrants artistry deductions as defined by the code - there is a lack of posture, relationship with music, proper releve, etc."
1150,2020-09-03 06:02:35,ijh1ke,"It's real and not hypothetical. It was published in the [full results book.](http://www.mediafire.com/file/t7j92fgqkb52xu7/GA_Olympic_Game_Delegation_Result_Book-2.pdf/file)

1151,2020-08-30 20:17:41,ijh1ke,"What issues do you take with Seda's artistry?

Her 2016 floor routine was Armenian music with dancing inspired by [traditional Armenian dancing.](https://twitter.com/russiangymnast/status/711530878074265600) And given that ethnic Armenians are often discriminated against in Russia, I find her choice extra bold.

This is my issue with artistry deductions. People see a routine like Seda's, hate it, yet don't even know the backstory of it and claim it's unartistic."
1152,2020-08-30 18:32:21,ijh1ke,"> It was particularly alarming to see the two asian programs receive the most deductions.

Alarming, but not shocking when Bruno Grandi himself said:

> They (Japan) have improved the construction of their exercises, leaving behind Eastern-style choreographies to move towards the West, that is to say more harmony, imagination, creativity.

>I'm not criticising Japanese culture, which is huge, but they have built a nice crowd-pleasing routine for the spectators. They've moved away from tradition, and the Chinese should do the same. If they stay like they are, they are robots.

(Hilarious seeing his praise of Japan though when the numbers show Japan was hit hard with artistry deductions.)"
1153,2020-08-30 19:44:01,ijh1ke,"It's obviously unfair that other gymnasts were judged more harshly, but I actually think the judgement of Aly is fair. What warrants an artistry deduction in this beam routine? None of the things you listed are artistry deductions on beam. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSYqnS-bPeg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSYqnS-bPeg)

Like others have said, the ambiguity and subjectivity of artistry is a huge problem. But Aly exhibits confidence, personal style, and smooth, intentional pacing. Those are the potential artistry deductions on beam. The exact text from the COP is:

Artistry & Composition Deductions  
Artistry of Performance

—Insufficient artistry of performance throughout the exercise including:  
 Confidence  
 Personal style

—Rhythm & Tempo  
 Insufficient variation in rhythm & tempo in movements (no DV)  
 Performance of the entire exercise as a series of disconnected elements & movements (lack of fluency)"
1154,2020-08-30 20:57:23,ijh1ke,I feel like a lot of people don't find artistic value in routines unless the dance is based on Russian ballet. There are plenty of dance cultures throughout the world where fluidity and pointed toes aren't part of the equation.
1155,2020-08-30 18:44:53,ijh1ke,"This is so crazy.  Some of my fave routines are the ones that pay tribute to the gymnast’s culture or heritage.  Cheng Fei 2008, Murakami 2013, Dos Santos 2004, etc.  It’s ridiculous the old president thought this was okay only from Western countries."
1156,2020-08-30 19:58:10,ijh1ke,"She doesn’t have any variation in tempo. I would also deduct for “lack of creativity in movements and transitions” which was a deduction in the 2016 COP as well.  There is “poor body posture” deductions as well as amplitude that she would receive, but these seem to be a different category of deductions in the 2016 COP."
1157,2020-08-30 21:18:53,ijh1ke,Definitely agree.  I remember how off put some people were by Yulia Inshina's 2016 floor routine which heavily featured Lezginka style dancing because there really haven't been any gymnasts to do native Azerbaijani dance styles in their routine before.
1158,2020-08-31 06:46:39,ijh1ke,Tbh I even find a lot of the Russian ballet style routines to be flat.  Very few tend to be good.
1159,2020-08-30 18:51:52,ijh1ke,"> Murakami 2013,

One of the hills that I will happily die on is my belief that Mai's Yoshida Brothers routine was one of if not the most artistic routines of 2013 and it infuriates me that she doesn't get proper recognition for it."
1160,2020-08-30 20:30:41,ijh1ke,"I'm not a gymnast, but . . . where are you seeing ""poor body posture""?  All I can see that would fit with that is that her shoulders look a little rounded . . . which is mostly because she has so much muscle in her shoulders and back.  In every straight-on view, it's clear that her shoulders are back when she's standing upright.  It feels like you're arguing for a body type deduction."
1161,2020-08-30 20:53:13,ijh1ke,"Again, I have not said anything about body type.  

Look at Aly's compared to Produnova, another power gymnast with a more muscular build.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIiQfRcSI-k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIiQfRcSI-k) you can see Yelena's shoulders are more down and pushed back especially when the arms are moving, ribs are in, indicating dance training and proper posture.  When Aly does her poses, her shoulders raise up and her ribs come out indicating a lack of focus on the posture.  Yelena Shushunova is another more muscular gymnast that was able to show proper posture throughout routines."
1162,2020-08-30 21:27:51,ijh1ke,"Yes!! Barring spinal issues, posture is TRAINING. I love seeing this discussed. I see a lot of ""ballet isn't artistry"" folks make zero effort to scratch beneath the surface of what ""ballet"" actually means. No one cares if your choreography is balletic or not, but ballet is an important foundational piece of training that makes a world of difference in presentation of every style."
1163,2020-08-31 01:49:46,ijh1ke,"I don’t know the code, but if there are deductions for posture and lack or releve should be under technique not artistry. I do understand that some things aren’t sufficient on an individual skill to receive a deduction but you may want to deduct 0.1 overall for lack of releve, but it should be u set some kind of general technique section."
1164,2020-08-31 04:47:11,ijh1ke,"Batshit thought of the day: maybe artistry should also have an E-score lmaooo (I'm kidding in case anyone gets big mad about that). I do think posture and extension in choreography lumps in well enough with the ""presentation"" side of artistry, so I have no problem with it being a factor in an artistry deduction. 

But as we can see in the doc on this post, artistry is deducted so inconsistently that it depends on your name and your flag :/ it really sucks because the difference here can make or break finals and medals, and having evidence that it's inconsistently applied is frustrating."
1165,2020-08-30 15:28:45,ijecwf,"I think it’s only about 50/50 Simone adds to this total, because I think it’s only about a 50/50 chance Tokyo happens. It’s a realistic possibility that they cannot safety organize and in that case, the chances of her going to 2022/23/24 are.... minuscule at best."
1166,2020-08-30 15:32:48,ijecwf,"If Simone misses a chance at a second Olympics I will cry. There will be 30 gymnasts who either have as many, or more Olympic medals than the GOAT despite Simone having never missed an Olympics due to injury and having one of the longest careers amongst AA Champions."
1167,2020-08-30 19:26:11,ijecwf,The most heartbreaking part about the Olympics being cancelled is that Simone is slated to be the face of them (now that Usain Bolt and Michael Phelps are retired).
1168,2020-08-30 20:43:32,ijecwf,"She was a Jeopardy question and was the poster athlete in all the NBC advertisements. There's a very big difference between being the most recognizable WAG vs being the most recognizable American athlete. For the first time ever, a WAG was the biggest name across all American Olympic sports in the buildup to an Olympic Games. It was a literal once in a lifetime scenario. Her 2013, 2014, & 2015 titles were irrelevant in the grand scheme of things to the casual Olympic viewer. They didn't know who she was until 2016."
1169,2020-08-30 19:27:33,ijecwf,"If it makes you feel better the whole “face of the Olympics” is just a marketing thing, it’s not an actual designation or anything.

1170,2020-08-30 20:13:16,ijecwf,It means money for Simone and recognition for black excellence
1171,2020-08-30 22:54:24,ijecwf,"the marketing thing is the important part. huge money making opportunity

having the most name recognition at an olympics means millions and millions of potential dollars"
1172,2020-08-30 19:34:50,ijecwf,It also kinda suggests she probably would have been flag bearer again because it was her and Phelps for 2016 opening ceremony and closing ceremony
1173,2020-08-30 22:56:09,ijecwf,"He’s that’s true, but saying she’s “slated to be” implies that the face of the Olympics is a real position. It’s literally just NBC marketing. 

Even without NBC plastering her face anywhere Simone is a big enough star at this point to get her own endorsement deals. Her showing up benefits NBC more than NBC using a buttload of promo photos benefits her"
1174,2020-08-27 16:46:05,ihmyg0,"I don't know, it seems like on the whole she's pretty well regarded, at least for her most visible work (celebrities). She takes visually interesting portraits of famous people. It's not exactly world changing but she seems to do it well and makes nice magazine covers.

The Simone Biles things doesn't even have anything to do with Liebovitz, just that people would have preferred a black photographer for a black subject, apparently."
1175,2020-08-27 15:30:14,ihmyg0,"I think most of the criticism now comes from how she gets to her finished photos. She basically shows up to press the button on the camera/interact with the subjects. All the lighting and setup is done by her team. All the editing is done by her team. Its not really ""her"" anymore."
1176,2020-08-27 23:30:26,ihmyg0,">Is it that she is good but not that good? If so I’m interested in some insight from a professional and technical point of view.

First, if you are big, people seem to feel free to hate on you. She's one if not the most well known living photographer. So it comes with the territory.

She also kind of seems like she's phoning it in at times. Like the master classes, and some stuff around her professionalism.

So people complain."
1177,2020-08-28 08:15:32,ihmyg0,"It's probably hard to pin down specifically and it's just a suspicion that I have but I think it's for similar reasons that many/most(?) people are not particularity found of high fashion and catwalk models (not as persons but the fashion and maybe also body type/thinness). I assume there is a certain distaste because it doesn't fit very well into the prevalent understanding of beauty. 

Basically I think that to most people her photos are just not beautiful, and perceived as pretentious and aloof. Another comparison might be to various forms of (post)modern art (Duchamp’s Urinal might come to mind). But I don't want to insinuate that ""ordinary people"" just want beautiful art in the ""it looks nice and I want to hang it in my living room""-sense. Beauty comes in many forms and Leibovitz certainly also has lots of those in her portfolio (imo). But for much of her work my guess is most people don't see the meaning/effort/point of it. It might seem as being ""artsy for the sake of being artsy"".

Having said all that, her portfolio and range is pretty big and I think there are photos that would probably find a broad consensus of being good/great: http://www.artnet.com/artists/annie-leibovitz/2"

1180,2020-08-27 20:32:33,ihmyg0,The lighting on one of the photos was pretty garbage. I blame the editor for publishing as much as I do the photographer.

There was that, but there were also people criticizing the photography. Too dark, bad light, that sort of thing. I thought that was true for some of the images. it wasn’t *that * terrible but because it’s Annie Leibowitz people really got their panties in a bunch about it on Twitter."
1182,2020-08-27 15:45:57,ihmyg0,"That's quite interesting actually. At some of the most famed three-star Michelin restaurants, the head chef isn't even cooking in the kitchen; the work is all done by the underlings. Would this be a similar comparison?"
1183,2020-08-27 19:00:22,ihmyg0,Not any different from how Andy Warhol created work.
1184,2020-08-27 18:36:54,ihmyg0,"I think that's such strange criticism. 

Setting up a softbox is not where the art is. Neither is retouching. The art in her photography is in having the vision of what the image should look like, and in directing everyone involved to make that happen."
1185,2020-08-27 15:35:18,ihmyg0,"Doesn’t she direct the whole art direction of the projects? I genuinely don’t know, so I’m asking"
1186,2020-08-27 15:41:17,ihmyg0,"I find that a weird criticism, because people don't have any idea what went into pre-production. In many big photo or video productions, creatives will come up with concepts they want to achieve, then experts (key grips, costume designers, DoP's, etc) pull it all together safely. If she has no input into the pre or post-production, then it would be fair... but difficult to know if that is the case."
1187,2020-08-28 00:53:43,ihmyg0,"That's bit of a cop out. That would be like saying a director shouldnt get credit for a movie because all they did was show up and talk to some actors. It completley negates everything they did to prepare for and visualise the shoot, ignores how they user their crew, and it ignores how interacting with the subject to get what you need out of them is just as important as pointing the camera at them and hitting the shutter.

Personally, my issue with her work is that as her workflow has become increasingly technically proficient, the end result seems to have become increasingly safe and boring, and just looks more and more artificial. 
I could look at her low-fi make-it-up-as-you-go 70's and 80's work forever though."
1188,2020-08-27 15:32:26,ihmyg0,That’s essentially the kid who did nothing in the group project but puts their name on it anyways
1189,2020-08-28 03:11:31,ihmyg0,"Ya but if you look at her portfolio she’s photographed POC in so many different ways, it makes me think it was just a stylistic choice, and because of the political climate people just chose to jump on a handful of images instead of look at her entire body of work which does a fairly respectable job of portraying their skin in a light that many would consider accurate and beautiful."
1190,2020-08-27 18:42:49,ihmyg0,"I like the comparison to filmmaking. 

Most famous directors don't even don't even touch the camera. They don't set up the light or lay down the dolly track. They just have a huge team of people and they tell them what to do. Even the DP, who is responsible for the 'look' of the film, does very little of the actual hands-on work themselves. They don't build the camera, they don't rig the grip, they don't set up any of the light. They even have a person whose only job is to *focus* the camera for them. 

Still we say that the film is made by director x, or for if you go a little bit deeper into the look of the film you say it was shot by cinematographer y. This is because they had the vision to make the film what it is. 

It's the same in this kind of big production photography. It simply wouldn't make sense for the photographer to do everything themselves, but they need to be the one with the vision and direct everyone to help execute that vision."
1191,2020-08-27 18:41:27,ihmyg0,In most of those restaurants the head chef still sets the menu and trains his staff to cook his recipes.
1192,2020-08-27 18:43:36,ihmyg0,"No, it's more like someone who writes a novel by dictating it rather than typing it themselves."
1193,2020-08-27 18:42:20,ihmyg0,"Film directors don't run the cameras, or write the scripts, or color the film. Of course other people get credit for those too, but it's understood that the director was the one making the decisions, and the other team members were acting under the directors vision."
1194,2020-08-28 00:56:49,ihmyg0,Never worked on a film or photography set I take it?
1195,2020-08-27 18:52:33,ihmyg0,Gregory Crewdson runs some of his work this way.  It's almost like a movie set on some of them.
1196,2020-08-28 02:15:34,ihmyg0,"I genuinely don’t know: does Leibovitz not instruct the trained assistants on how the lighting should look (the light recipe, so to speak)? Or do they have free rein to light it how they please?"
1197,2020-08-27 20:01:33,ihmyg0,"Yes, his process is almost exactly like filmmaking. 

But it applies to any photographer working with assistants. If I tell an assistant to put up a light here and a bounce there rather than doing it myself, it’s still my photograph."
1198,2020-08-27 20:27:31,ihmyg0,Was about to mention him. It's crazy the amount of work that goes into his images.
1199,2020-08-28 03:18:14,ihmyg0,"Generally speaking, yes.  Photographers at (and even a good bit below) that level hand pick their assistants, and they have a whole team who have different jobs.  She trains them, and they basically learn to think just like her until they're basically just an extension of her.    


Additionally, she'll more than likely do the majority of planning and art direction for a shoot, if not her alone then there's usually an art director that she'll collaborate with to come up with a plan.  That info is then filtered down to the assistants, who implement it day of.

A lot of the bigger photographers seem to do this from what I've seen and heard.  Lindbergh, Leibovitz, Weber, Mert & Marcus, etc etc.  Once you're making millions you tend to not want to be bothered with setting up c-stands I guess.  

She's a perfectly fine photographer, she (or the AD for the magazine) just made the mistake of having her retoucher (and no, Leibovitz doesn't do her own retouching)  get too creative with skin tones on a black model at a very touchy moment in time, so now her skillset and body of work is being questioned...mostly by people with no real understanding of why/how the photos ended up like they did."
1200,2020-08-28 11:08:37,ihmyg0,"> Generally speaking, yes. 

To be clear: yes on the first question, no on the second."

1228,2020-10-09 01:18:55,j7ns8g,"hmmm, this is a tricky situation to be in!! The thing is, gamines accommodate petitness, which is being short AND narrow, and the only types that accommodates width are naturals. FGs are describe as being possibly broadly angular, but that just means having certain features, wether it’s shoulders or hips being slightly wider than a very narrow torso to exaggerate angularity, but not wide, like it’s still overall very narrow. Are you sure that you accommodate width? Or are you just over analyzing yourself? If you decide that you are accommodating width, i can assure you that it’s very possible to be a short FN. I would check out my queen and icon Sara Jessica Parker! She is a short FN!! However, FNs DO have vertical, but i’m assuming if you identify as an FG right now you have vertical. If you don’t, then you are probably a pure N, and then we’ll shit idek how to help you there 😂 i would be a pure G if it still existed and boy is it a struggle"
1229,2020-10-09 04:27:28,j7ns8g,Yesss I’m the same I am stuck half way between FN and FG I am 5’4 and I felt either SD or SN was the one that would bring in both. I am constantly cycling FN SD SN FG!!! I hope you can find yours soon. I find it so interesting that you are between FN and FG and thought SN because I am the same. I wonder if SN is the best middle ground between the two? Idk!!
1230,2020-10-09 05:36:35,j7ns8g,"Well there is SN with G influence, you can have both!"
1231,2020-10-09 08:30:51,j7ns8g,Sarah Jessica Parker is a 5'3 flamboyant natural. Kibbe verified I believe.
1232,2020-10-09 03:15:50,j7ns8g,"Look into N stuff. My mom is essentially the short FN, as in broad across shoulders and ribcage, but has shapely muscle and not much softness. She's 5'2"". She loves N recs. That's how she originally ID'd herself from the book before kibbe got rid of it."
1233,2020-10-12 03:37:44,j7ns8g,"You described my exact body and I've been deciding between SN, FN and FG for so long lmao. I think I definitely have a broad ribcage as well as shoulders and they do need to be accommodated because even when I was almost underweight a size S top might feel too constricted on me. Therefore, I figured I'm a Natural type  for sure but then I have to figure out if I'm ""soft"" enough  for SN and I'm not sure... and then I wonder if I look tall enough for FN... and then I'm like wait maybe I actually look short and compact like a FG? It's an endless cycle for me atm lol. Not helpful ik but you're not alone!"
1234,2020-10-09 02:02:43,j7ns8g,"Idk, it might be the BDD, fam. I know I look very obviously short in pics...like I look simultaneously impish and athletic.

1235,2020-10-09 02:05:35,j7ns8g,"yeah, i feel that, i think a lot of times we see ourselves as having much more width than we actually do. I even have crisis times when i’m like “i think i’m a natural??” and i’m very narrow lol, and all of my kibbe friends are just like 🤦‍♀️. Tina is still verified, and i personally think ellen is a pure G!!"

On a more negative note, Simone's wolf turn sometimes looks too unstable, as in her leg is not at the same elevation all the way through, and her feet are noticeably flexed (unfortunately just due to her flat feet).

1298,2020-10-02 23:02:00,j43xe4,"Omg yes, exactly. The skill is ugly no matter who does it. It’s an irredeemable skill."
1299,2020-10-03 05:53:36,j43xe4,"To me, the gymnast always looks like a frog in a blender."
1300,2020-10-03 02:53:24,j43xe4,I love the piked and hate the tucked for exactly this reason
1301,2020-10-03 10:56:44,j43xe4,👏👏👏 100% they’re so overused.
1302,2020-10-03 02:12:04,j43xe4,If anyone should be allowed to do wolf turns it’s Grace McCallum. Simone used to be better but now she whips them around and they are not cute
1303,2020-10-03 05:15:47,j43xe4,"I don't like Simone's wolf turns anymore because she flails her arms.

In my opinion, I like Riley, Grace, and Sunisa's wolf turns best! They're all very patient with the turns."
1304,2020-10-02 23:29:41,j43xe4,"Simone should absolutely not be allowed to do wolf turns. Every time she does it, she looks awkward and makes me long for the old scoring system."
1305,2020-10-03 00:54:51,j43xe4,i don't think I've ever seen a WAG attempt a front attitude turn? either that or it was so poorly executed i didn't know that's what they intended
1306,2020-10-03 03:02:16,j43xe4,what does a front attitude turn look like?
1307,2020-10-03 06:41:55,j43xe4,Mohini Bhardwaj 2004 also did an amazing FTDLO off bars.
1308,2020-10-03 01:01:02,j43xe4,Omgggg I hate two wolf turns in a row
1309,2020-10-03 07:09:49,j43xe4,Myzdrikova was amazing too. And from a whip no less.
1310,2020-10-03 22:03:02,j43xe4,I don’t think Asac gets enough credit for how textbook perfect her tumbling was. I think she could’ve definitely upped the difficulty (which is saying a lot since she had a pretty difficult routine) and slacked on form but she didn’t which I have a lot of respect for. I also think she was one of the few power gymnasts of that era who was able to add some style and sass to her routine. Asac’s floor walked so Laurie Hernandez’s floor could run.
1311,2020-10-02 23:00:36,j43xe4,"While her form is good, it still bothers me when gymnasts do multiple wolf turns in a row :/"
1312,2020-10-03 00:11:10,j43xe4,This is the only correct answer.
1313,2020-10-03 06:15:23,j43xe4,"I think Alicia Sacramone and Shawn Johnson also did good double pike dismounts, but your right most of them land with their chest low."
1314,2020-10-03 07:24:28,j43xe4,"Out of the current gymnasts doing the dismount, I think Melnikova does it best!"
1315,2020-10-03 00:36:40,j43xe4,I love onodis. That’s on my favorite skills list
1316,2020-10-03 05:54:55,j43xe4,"Regular Onodi's look beautiful, even when sluggish.  The two foot landed Onodi's looks look somebody messed up the skill."
1317,2020-10-03 06:50:45,j43xe4,"I love a sneaky Onodi, where it looks like the gymnast is about to do a back handspring and in a millisecond you're like ""wait how is she facing the other way? is this from the exorcist?"""
1318,2020-10-03 22:03:44,j43xe4,Laurie Hernandez would like a word
1319,2020-10-03 03:22:26,j43xe4,i don't like giengers at all they are so ugly.
1320,2020-10-03 10:57:36,j43xe4,That’s how I feel about layout giengers. It looks so weird. I like the pike. Maybe it’s cause I’m obsessed with McKayla’s liked gienger.
1321,2020-10-02 23:44:30,j43xe4,Nooooo! I love it though
1322,2020-10-03 02:13:08,j43xe4,"If they don’t point their feet, absolutely yes"
1323,2020-10-03 14:56:28,j43xe4,Yes! I don't like the skill at all. I respect how difficult it is but I think it's very ugly.
1324,2020-10-03 03:04:20,j43xe4,What’s a cat leap?
1325,2020-10-03 06:21:02,j43xe4,i like this one done in connection with her sissone for the leap series requirement https://youtu.be/ClYZN18DWZE
1326,2020-10-03 00:08:28,j43xe4,As well as Sunis one I think taller gymnasts have a benefit for that skill
1327,2020-10-04 08:17:21,j43xe4,Yes. In general I love graces beam routine. Especially the beginning. Even with the candle mount because I love our original she comes out of it. And I know she’s not elite or anything but Whitney bjerkin or whatever does really beautiful wolf turns too.
1328,2020-10-03 01:03:04,j43xe4,Tragic vs Epic side somis deserve their own thread!
1329,2020-10-03 22:05:29,j43xe4,Shawn and Nastia on beam throughout the 08 Olympics were perfection.
1330,2020-10-03 08:57:34,j43xe4,Sae Miyakawa’s is beautiful when she hits
1331,2020-10-03 05:17:39,j43xe4,I like Desiree Carofiglio's double front tuck too!!
1332,2020-10-02 22:45:49,j43xe4,[Cha Yong Hwa! ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=FI5NBKEObd0)
1333,2020-10-03 02:16:10,j43xe4,"Emilie Le Pennec and one other 2004-er (don’t remember who, but that one was actually better than Emilie’s) are pretty good"
1334,2020-10-03 03:06:28,j43xe4,"Backwards? The chinese girls have been doing them recently, I like Ou Yushan’s and a few others that I can’t remember. They point their toes and no cowboying, which makes the lines really pretty to me"
1335,2020-10-03 05:22:35,j43xe4,"Here is Simone wolf turning in Aliya Mustafina's face

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTFj2QsYH8c&t=0m45s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTFj2QsYH8c&t=0m45s)"
1336,2020-10-03 03:06:54,j43xe4,"Everyone has to have something they arent the best at, even the goat!"
1337,2020-10-03 02:57:22,j43xe4,"Simone did them good in her 2016 routines and before, mostly because of the turn she did out of them to make them seem pretty and not as out of place."
1338,2020-10-03 05:17:46,j43xe4,What's that?
1339,2020-10-03 09:35:05,j43xe4,Do you mean man wipe? Best wZ Taylor Rice (woman at Stanford)  recently shared on another thread here.
1340,2020-10-03 01:29:30,j43xe4,"Came here to pump Ou Yushan's side somi but will check out Koko's too.

Edit: ooh, fun! Koko does a piked version!
 https://mobile.twitter.com/pamchenkova/status/1193174314327138305"
1341,2020-10-03 05:01:10,j43xe4,"I’m with you, it’s one of my fav skills. Also love when Ponor did them"
1342,2020-10-03 05:17:20,j43xe4,I love me some Kotchetkova. I'll give her another look. Ponor as well!
1343,2020-10-02 23:41:08,j43xe4,"Definitely one of the better ones! Thanks for the example, because I was going to add I've seen some good ones from the Chinese gymnasts, but didn't have a specific example. I love their 1/1 pirouettes.

But even this good one is (basically) a 1/1 then a 1/2, because of that pause between the hand shifts. It's just basically impossible to get a smooth hand transition and stay on top of the bar."
1344,2020-10-03 00:52:13,j43xe4,i wish Yang Yilin and Nastia had shared the silver for 2008 bars with He Kexin as sole winner (not the original tie)
1345,2020-10-03 08:40:19,j43xe4,"Thanks for the videos! That last one is definitely the best I've seen, and look how far she travels down the bar! That's incredible. 

Those first three would all get minor deductions, per my armchair judging... the first two for being short of the handstand and the third for arch. Porgras' looks pretty darn good, though. Honestly they're all impressive, I just find it a hard skill to pull off correctly."
1346,2020-10-03 05:26:20,j43xe4,oh wow. I love it there. I can't stand Maggie's.
1347,2020-10-03 04:46:44,j43xe4,Never have I ever wanted to give gold for a comment before...but you’re so right!! Take my poor women’s gold 🏅
1348,2020-10-03 05:22:36,j43xe4,Still hate them. But this is the closest I've come to not hating them. Beautiful execution.
1349,2020-10-03 01:47:14,j43xe4,Beautiful!
1350,2020-10-02 23:14:17,j43xe4,"More tolerable because she does it with straighter legs, so sure. I still hate the skill but that’s probably the best version of it I’ve seen."
1351,2020-10-03 00:49:23,j43xe4,"total agree, I don't understand why people like her's the best. The 21st century best are Riley's imo, but they all pretty much suck. Go way old school with Kuchinskaya and Filatova if you want to see actually GORGEOUS wolf turns."
1352,2020-10-03 06:40:45,j43xe4,I heard horribly executed L-turns so could only think of [this](https://youtu.be/76WLQoh7khs?t=1m06s)
1353,2020-10-03 03:22:18,j43xe4,We have a few WAG provincial kids doing them but I think it’s just because the province is pretty RG heavy so there’s some crossover.
1354,2020-10-03 07:08:16,j43xe4,Tisha Volleman does them. It basically looks like an L-turn with a bent leg.
1355,2020-10-03 11:00:48,j43xe4,"Spencer at the Balance Beam Situation calls it ""the Beast"" and now so do I."
1356,2020-10-02 23:02:15,j43xe4,The new Code is coming to save you. ;)
1357,2020-10-03 00:46:35,j43xe4,So classy and if done seamlessly it really looks so good
1358,2020-10-03 13:32:46,j43xe4,"Nastia’s so good with that, when she does it on the balance beam I’m always so amazed!"
1359,2020-10-03 22:38:35,j43xe4,"I love Laurie, but I just didn't like her 2016 routine. She tried her best and I give her credit, but I don't think Laurie meshed with Haney's choreo."
1360,2020-10-03 03:25:41,j43xe4,I hope to God Suni doesn’t put one in her routine
1361,2020-10-03 06:44:50,j43xe4,"Cat leaps were the wolf turns of the 01-05 quad, where a double cat leap was a D and a 1.5 cat leap was a C, so quite a few gymnasts would [connect them to get 0.2 bonus](https://youtu.be/kdsRKw35Sg4?t=39s). It was by far the easiest way to make up the deficit of the base value going from 9.0 to 8.8 (although of course many skills and combos were downgraded from the 97-00 quad)."
1362,2020-10-03 03:09:25,j43xe4,"It’s like a hitch kick with bent legs. They are popular in NCAA on beam in combination with an ariel. In the 08 quad they were popular on floor in elite, usually cat leap fulls."
1363,2020-10-03 08:40:23,j43xe4,I still lose my shit every time I remember that Carofiglio can do a (lovely) Dowell from just a running punch.
1364,2020-10-02 23:56:48,j43xe4,I love her hop full too! I wish gymnasts still did those
1365,2020-10-03 06:19:02,j43xe4,"Elena Dolgopolova, Amelie Plante"
1366,2020-10-03 03:09:51,j43xe4,"Yeah, backwards. I know it’s irrational but I just hate how it looks lol."
1367,2020-10-03 14:19:06,j43xe4,Real footage of how judges physically feel when they watch wolf turns
1368,2020-10-03 00:05:35,j43xe4,Ah okay. I would be really impressed if anyone has done a totally smooth hand transition!
1369,2020-10-03 02:24:26,j43xe4,He Kexin  should have gotten that .5 deduction for dead hangs. Yang Yilin should have been deducted for muscled kids.
1370,2020-10-03 17:19:29,j43xe4,"People like Simone’s because she’s the only one who turns at an acceptable speed. Riley, Grace, Suni, Vlada etc. all have nice toe point and control but they are sloooooow"
1371,2020-10-03 02:52:26,j43xe4,"Def, simone does a ton of things better than everyone ever but the wolf turn is not one of them"
1372,2020-10-03 03:09:57,j43xe4,Filatova! [if you must do a wolf turn](https://russianglitter.tumblr.com/post/159924212217/if-you-must-do-a-wolf-turn)
1373,2020-10-03 08:35:58,j43xe4,"I feel like Simone's were miles better last quad, so she's kind of kept that reputation even though it's not particularly deserved anymore."
1374,2020-10-03 07:08:30,j43xe4,Yup. That's it!
1375,2020-10-03 14:40:33,j43xe4,oh fuck that's horrifying
1376,2020-10-03 07:47:50,j43xe4,"Ohhh that one. I think Ou Yushan does a rather nice one, but I’m probably just really biased lol"
1377,2020-10-03 02:25:37,j43xe4,You have to do the twist very quickly though.
1378,2020-10-04 08:15:27,j43xe4,Agreed. Her floor routine gave me second hand embarrassment and I never got the hype. All the limp wrist shaking and locked knees. Laurie did what she could.
1379,2020-10-04 05:37:08,j43xe4,I’m really stoked to see Laurie’s full new floor routine. Hope it suits her better.
1380,2020-10-03 03:15:17,j43xe4,"Actually 04 quad. Carly does a cat leap sequence right before her last pass

https://youtu.be/H8bBKsdOKkw"
1381,2020-10-03 03:41:04,j43xe4,haha that’s fair
1382,2020-10-03 03:03:01,j43xe4,"And Nastia should've been deducted appropriately for her frog legged dismount, what's your point?"
1383,2020-10-03 18:47:10,j43xe4,I actually think her speed shows off her lack of control. Wild arms and not a consistent level of her leg. She is so out of control on those turns and just throws them around with zero spotting.
1384,2020-10-03 15:49:56,j43xe4,That looks like a mangled turning [pas de chat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAsMB3eRe6g&ab_channel=RoyalOperaHouse) \- is that the intention?
1385,2020-10-04 06:40:09,j43xe4,oof that dancing
1386,2020-10-03 03:06:13,j43xe4,"She was deducted for her dismount, but a dead hang was worth .5 deduction for every occurrence, so we know He wasn’t deducted. She shouldn’t have been bars champion."
1387,2020-10-03 16:29:54,j43xe4,I think so but they always looks very sloppy to me.
1388,2020-10-03 03:22:22,j43xe4,"I’m no judge, but a quick watch through their routines and I probably would give Kexin a 9.1 and Nastia a 9.0 E. Nastia should’ve gotten at least .5 off for that horrid dismount, and Kexin presumably got .5 off for dead hang"
1389,2020-10-03 03:34:03,j43xe4,"Nastia had a leg separation in the air and a slight step on the landing. Even if you give a .3 on the leg separation (and they might have only given her .1), there was only a .1 step so at most she got a .4 deduction on the dismount."
1390,2020-10-03 03:34:32,j43xe4,Feet not pointed
1391,2020-10-03 03:38:11,j43xe4,"I’ll give you that, but I still think that He Kexin was scored generously.  Nastia had obvious deductions, but He had little ones that added up."
1392,2020-10-02 16:47:52,j3thos,I totally hear you. I read your post. Yeah
1393,2020-10-02 19:19:33,j3thos,Sabotage tastes well until revolution is served.
1394,2020-10-02 21:52:19,j3thos,"I don't hate Mondays, I hate Capitalism"
1395,2020-09-29 02:34:37,j1qjp0,"I regularly run while taking adderall. If I didn’t wear an Apple Watch I wouldn’t know this but my bpm gets up to 210 regularly. It doesn’t feel particularly bad or hurt or anything, it just feels like a high intensity workout. When I go upstairs, it’ll jump to 120+ but I don’t even notice at all. 

If your heart rate is making you dizzy, I’d talk to a doctor. That’s not normal."
1396,2020-09-29 02:35:13,j1qjp0,I know this sounds stupid but meditation. Meditation really helps.

1413,2020-09-23 17:25:53,iyc45l,Justina shows a lot of passion and confidence when she dances and knows how to move different body parts simultaneously. She finishes the moves and her face shows so much expression and excitement. So far I haven't noticed another celeb who brings that same energy so I think that helps her to stand out.

1448,2020-09-19 09:32:58,ivj7fe,I love this haiku
1449,2020-09-19 16:52:20,ivj7fe,Good bot
1450,2020-09-12 23:55:13,irnn2p,Both were equally majestic
1451,2020-09-10 20:23:46,iq83et,Amy Purdy not being on that list is a crime.
1452,2020-09-10 20:33:53,iq83et,You can still vote for her!
1453,2020-09-10 13:43:09,iq3csu,"Mma Fedor Emelianenko. There's debates as to who's the all time goat, but as the most dominating mma athlete at the time it's hard to not say Fjodor"
1454,2020-09-10 13:59:49,iq3csu,"Lewis Hamilton. Out of 258 Formula 1 races, he has finished on the podium 157 times, 89 of those being wins. He's got 6 world championship titles, and is well on his way to a 7th. Which means that for more than half of the time he has competed in the sport, he has been world champion..."
1455,2020-09-10 14:16:10,iq3csu,"The disparity will never be greater than Babe Ruth's. His production was more than most teams combined. Frank Baker had the nickname 'Home Run' because he hit 12 in one year and a league leading 9 a couple years later. Four years after that Ruth hit 29, then 54 the next year, and 59 the next year. When he hit 60, it wasn't hig news because everyone figured he'd just hit more next year."
1456,2020-09-10 23:10:20,iq3csu,"There’s a strong case for Australian cricketer Don Bradman.
I don’t follow cricket myself but as I understand it: a typical batting average is 20-40. Over 50 is exceptional and over 60 makes you top-5 all-time. Don Bradman’s average is 99.94. The rest of the top 10 all-time is in the 57-63 range. 

So it would something like a Baseball player batting career .540."
1457,2020-09-10 13:35:37,iq3csu,Absolutely Wayne Gretzky.
1458,2020-09-10 13:36:23,iq3csu,Sergueï Bubka never got anything other than gold.

1461,2020-09-10 18:43:27,iq3csu,Micheal Jordan in his prime was payed over 60 million dollars for a contract. That is worth more than some complete nba teams
1462,2020-09-10 13:42:12,iq3csu,"Jesse Owens,  Usain Bolt, Muhammad Ali.

In a less famous field, Bill Kazmaier was once so dominating in strongmen competitions that he was banned from competing at ""world strongest man"" for 5 years because he was too dominant.

Also, for strategy board games (not sure if you'd want them counted), Kasparov for Chess, and Go Seigen for Go."
1463,2020-09-10 13:46:33,iq3csu,"agreed.  I've always been in the ""Fedor camp"" as far as him being the greatest of all-time, although despite his being a ""fuck-head"" (lol) and getting into a lot of legal trouble, Jon Jones certainly has a claim to the title, as I believe Khabib does too."
1464,2020-09-10 13:47:36,iq3csu,"isn't it spelled Fedor OR Fyodor, not Fjodor?"
1465,2020-09-10 14:36:38,iq3csu,"Perhaps, but you also have to take into account there were no African-Americans, it was the ""dead ball era"", etc."
1466,2020-09-11 15:27:20,iq3csu,"wow, that IS impressive....even if cricket is a stupid sport lol - sorry for the non sequitur."
1467,2020-09-10 13:48:03,iq3csu,"interesting....I didn't realize that, he's a helluva candidate then."
1468,2020-09-10 13:50:31,iq3csu,"but since they're both close to one another, they'd kinda be disqualified, now wouldn't they?"
1469,2020-09-10 17:26:11,iq3csu,if you're going to argue him - why not just argue Michael Phelps?
1470,2020-09-10 18:44:47,iq3csu,"I'm not talking about ""monetary value"".  I'm talking about ""which athlete was better at their sport compared to their 'colleagues' during the time they played than anybody else was"" ?"
1471,2020-09-10 13:45:13,iq3csu,"all good choices.....i especially like the choice of Kazmaier if that is indeed true (I have no reason to doubt you, so I'll take your word for it, lol)."
1472,2020-09-10 13:50:13,iq3csu,It's hard to pick only one goat! I started watching mma at the time of Fedors run in Pride so it's probably a little nostalgia to why I hug his nuts. Jones might be the real mvp though
1473,2020-09-10 13:51:53,iq3csu,"Feeeiiidooorrr emmeerrriiiaannennkkooo (pride voice) Yeah its probably with a y, not a j :)"
1474,2020-09-10 17:22:53,iq3csu,"Babe ruth was hitting the same baseballs everyone else was hitting.  

Negro leaguers were hitting home runs on par with MLB players. Even if you say Josh Gibson was better than Babe Ruth, he came along in the 30s where players were hitting 40 and 50 home runs regularly, so while he was a great hitter, he wasn't on the same scale as ruth."
1475,2020-09-11 09:14:38,iq3csu,Spitz had a moustache.
1476,2020-09-10 18:45:42,iq3csu,Yeah he was payed that much because he is literally the best player of all time...
1477,2020-09-10 13:53:01,iq3csu,"I'm the exact same way.  I still think (albeit in different weight classes) Khabib is right on Jones' tail if not ""neck and neck"" with him.  But in reality, you probably can't/shouldn't call anybody the P4P ""G.O.A.T."" because it's all hypothetical and we'll never see them fight each other, and we can't tell if Jones' speed at a smaller weight class would be a better attribute than Fedor's power at a larger weight class (although I ALWAYS thought he was flabby at HW and should've ideally fought his career at LHW).

Anyway, I'm rambling now, so I'll STFU, lol."
1478,2020-09-10 17:28:27,iq3csu,didn't Josh Gibson hit 84 HRs in a season?
1479,2020-09-10 18:46:31,iq3csu,"no arguments, but statistically, was he more dominant that the next closest guy (IMHO, Magic Johnson) ?"
1480,2020-09-10 13:58:51,iq3csu,"P4P goat discussions are really just people picking they're favorite fighter among the goats. It's as you say very hypothetical. Let's wait and see how Jones fare in the hw division, good fights ahead if true"
1481,2020-09-10 18:48:22,iq3csu,I don’t know his statistics exactly but he was probably the best player in his time(other than shaq who came in right before his break and became the 1 pick)
1482,2020-09-10 18:49:47,iq3csu,"again, I'm not arguing if he was the best player in his time or not, everybody that's been mentioned has had that ""title"" in their own right."
1483,2020-09-10 18:50:39,iq3csu,Oh I’m not arguing with you just talking basketball lol

1535,2020-11-03 20:13:06,jnh7wp,It seems like the earliest years who show traits for the next generation tend to have celebrities with a very different style compared to the ones born prior. My theory is that the years who show the earliest traits help pioneer the culture of the next generation.
1536,2020-11-03 20:24:37,jnh7wp,Naked Brothers Band. Leo Howard. Jaden Smith. Other celebrities from Disney channel and Nick shows of the 2010s. Some YouTubers like Mr. Beast.
1537,2020-11-03 20:19:06,jnh7wp,1994-1999 or 1995-2000 could be Late Millennials with Zoomer-influencing celebrities born those years. Same with 1958-1963 or 1959-1964 as Late Boomers with X-influencing celebrities.
1538,2020-11-03 20:28:53,jnh7wp,I watched all the 2010’s Disney shows and I’m pretty sure I got all of them that are Zillennials. I added the rest of your suggestions tho

1541,2020-11-03 20:24:24,jnh7wp,I guess that makes sense.
1542,2020-11-03 20:25:53,jnh7wp,"Culturally, these groups are Jonesers and Zillennials respectively, but just Late Boomers (which are what Jones really is) and Late Millennials (which are what Zillennials really are) historically."

1544,2020-11-03 03:53:08,jn2p6y,"For Simone at least, I think it's to reduce risk of injury. Just because she makes everything *look* easy, doesn't mean some of those skills aren't incredibly difficult for her and therefore more dangerous. 

Also, she doesn't  need the extra points from the harder skills to win so it's a high risk, low reward situation."
1545,2020-11-03 07:16:03,jn2p6y,"Someone like Vanessa Ferrari at a smaller competition will do an easier floor routine in qualification just to get into finals. She knows that routine won’t medal, but if she can guarantee a hit easier routine to make the finals, she can then go for it all in the final. Whereas if she did the riskier routine in qualification, she may have an error that prevents her from making the finals. 

The stamina needed for a full in vs a double double is a lot more than what “one more twist” seems like."
1546,2020-11-03 04:16:31,jn2p6y,Yes. For safety reasons in my mind. You would rather lose a few tenths in difficulty than lose your season. It may look easy in both instances but they may be more fatigued than they show.
1547,2020-11-03 07:16:13,jn2p6y,"They only make it look easy.  If a gymnast throws a trick without having enough power to complete it (whether because they screwed up the entry or just because it's the end of the routine and they're tired) they can end up ""twisting into the ground"" on landing.  This is a good way to shred a knee or ankle.  Aliya Mustafina is a recent cautionary tale.  In 2010, she was the best in the world by a comfortable margin.  There was talk of a new Russian dynasty built around her.  Then at the 2011 Euros (where she was expected to easily win) she tore her ACL while landing short on an Amanar vault.  Obviously, she went on to have an amazing career, but she never really regained her pre-injury dominance.  If she'd thrown a double twist rather than the 2.5, she'd have had a lot more room for error and probably could have landed it safely.

Edit for context on Aliya:  her qualifying score at Euros was more than 2 points higher than the score of the eventual all-around champion.  Granted, Euros has a smaller field than Worlds, but, still, that's practically Simone-levels of dominance.  The Amanar gave her an extra 0.8 points over the DTY.  She could've taken it out, done everything else the same, and won by a point and a half or so."
1548,2020-11-03 19:11:16,jn2p6y,"Sometimes, especially if a gymnast is tired, a difficult move is not worth the deduction from poor execution."
1549,2020-11-03 16:52:40,jn2p6y,"It depends on what you need from that routine at that moment, and  a question of risk versus reward.  Even though they make the hard routine look easy there’s generally less margin for error if your adding difficulty. 

In qualifying you don’t have to be top, you have to do enough.  In the team event going all out is a massive risk - you could put your team in an unassailable lead, but equally you could blow their chances.  Doing enough keeps the pressure on all the other competitors, if you go big and blow it that opens the door right up.

In the beam final in 2016 Sanne changed her routine at the last minute after Simone made an error, and downgraded to an easier one where she could max out her e-score.  She did the maths and went with the routine with the highest chance of getting the score she needed."
1550,2020-11-05 21:22:10,jn2p6y,"Regarding Simone, she is just so good at making things look easy. The issue with a double double off beam is if you slip a foot it could be a life threatening injury. If you look up Riley McCusker’ s beam dismount from 2017 where she fell you will see what I mean."
1551,2020-11-02 05:05:12,jmfaxo,Imagine having your backflip complimented by one of the best gymnasts of all time! Really happy for Hines
1552,2020-11-02 06:31:24,jmfaxo,"Simone Biles on Twitter: ""That was an ok move but I could probably have done better in a similar situation"" (in reference to Hines flips)"
1553,2020-11-02 05:55:54,jmfaxo,So cool! Hines is our x factor and go to look in the RZ.
1554,2020-11-02 03:18:14,jmfaxo,Boo! She’s a Texans fan
1555,2020-11-02 12:34:39,jmfaxo,She is the best gymnast of all time at this point I’m pretty sure. But yeah hats off to Hines for pulling that off. Although the second one wasn’t as clean.
1556,2020-11-02 21:25:34,jmfaxo,She is only 23 lol
1557,2020-11-02 03:46:16,jmfaxo,Bigger than football. Let Hines get some shine ! He has been all over social media today
1558,2020-11-02 05:54:39,jmfaxo,Cool. Prob why she's watching
1559,2020-11-02 13:23:35,jmfaxo,"I mean she grew up near Houston, so I feel like that makes it even cooler. Game recognizes game regardless of affiliation"
1560,2020-11-02 16:52:59,jmfaxo,And in the world of spinning backflips she's the expert
1561,2020-11-02 13:29:04,jmfaxo,Wouldn’t that apply to any “greatest of all time” person 😂
1562,2020-11-02 13:35:20,jmfaxo,I mean saying she’s one of the best gymnasts ever really undersells her given her accomplishments. That’s like saying Michael Phelps is one of the best swimmers ever or Usain bolt is one of the fastest track runners ever.

1565,2020-10-31 13:43:43,jlewf5,Yep it’s her. She has an album coming out so she would have a reason to be on it.
1566,2020-10-31 14:23:49,jlewf5,TBH its who I was thinking based solely on the facts that we need a gold medal winner and I know she's been trying to get into the music industry
1567,2020-10-31 15:29:04,jlewf5,This is the best guess for Jellyfish I’ve seen so far. Good job!
1568,2020-10-31 15:56:51,jlewf5,"i actually like this theory now, im gonna stick to McKayla now"
1569,2020-10-31 16:08:08,jlewf5,"Wow good theory.
I’m still on the Charli Damelio side, but this is probably my main guess now and Charli is my second"
1570,2020-11-01 03:18:10,jlewf5,"I like most of these, some are stretches, but for the most part, this is a good write-up. One thing though: baby powder is not nearly identical to gymnastics chalk. In fact, it has the exact opposite effect. I'm not sure I buy into them giving us a clue that is technically wrong intentionally because a lot of people will misinterpret it. However, it could be that the actual clue is just simply ""powder"", which gymnastics chalk is sometimes called, and they decided to use that instead of a clue for chalk, which would be a lot more obvious."
1571,2020-10-31 17:57:34,jlewf5,My thoughts on the baby powder were that maybe it is Shawn Johnson and baby powder brand Johnson & Johnson
1572,2020-11-01 18:41:48,jlewf5,Does that mean she’s winning?
1573,2020-11-01 03:44:09,jlewf5,"Oh, and great connection to the Bad Guys lyrics and Nassar being the ""bad guy"" that she wants no part of. I like that a lot and think that's the most convincing link to Maroney out of all of them. If that is what the clue winds up being, what a genius method of hinting at an absolutely terrible situation without seeming too obvious or disrespectful.

The bouncer looking disapproving for a second before the Jellyfish's bubble pops. Could that be a reference to her famous face without being too blatant?"
1574,2020-11-01 18:43:18,jlewf5,I don’t think she’s that good but I think I she will get far enough that people learn she can “sing” and for publicity.
1575,2020-11-01 05:15:32,jlewf5,"Thanks, there are still a few that I’m working on making stronger connections for. For the angelfish I found something where someone claimed she’s an Angels fan and found a picture of her in an Angels hat, but I don’t think that’s really a confirmation so I’m still trying to lock that down. That would be a much stronger connection if it’s true.

The word powder is underlined on the bottle so it’s likely that your explanation is right. They wanted to emphasize that word since the clue isn’t baby powder, it’s just powder.

I think my favorite clue is the flower crown at Coachella. The flowers, color, and situation can all be tied to her. It’s, IMO, the strongest connection. The bad guy would be my favorite but it could still work with tons of other people. I’ve seen Aly Raisman and Simone Biles guessed and both would fit that clue. I think it works best with McKayla though because she was said to be one of his favorites. The other girls have actually said before they realized what he was really doing they’d be upset at times because of all the extra “treatments” she would get. At one point he even told her parents that he loved her.

Edit to add: The Los Angeles Angels are based in Orange County so it makes sense that she would be an Angels fan. I don’t know why I didn’t even think of that until now 🤦🏻‍♀️😂"
1576,2020-11-01 06:43:20,jlewf5,"Oh believe me, I know all about that horrible pathetic human. The crown is a great connection as well, for sure. And great catch on powder being underlined, I didn't even see that. Stupid default 720p.

As for the Angels, the clue pointing to her being an Angels fan would make perfect sense imo. The official full name of the team is the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, and I swear I am not making that up. California is weird. That being said, Anaheim is a part of Orange County.

This feels very much like the Kitty situation last year that I fell DEEP into, where they made it seem like it was Sarah Hyland, but it didn't quite *all* fit, until someone brought up Jackie Evancho, and then the clues fell into place. At this point, I'm down to Maroney, Chloe Kim, or someone I haven't seen mentioned. This Wednesday's episode should all but close the case, hopefully."
1577,2020-10-29 00:37:07,jjze8h,Okay butttt Corbin and Daniella is the pair we need
1578,2020-10-29 01:00:39,jjze8h,"Idk about pros right now, but I will say that I wish (most) would be with their OG partners

Women: Zendaya, Simone, Heather, Normani, Paige, Lindsey Stirling (Backup: Tinashe because she had potential, Mirai, because I watched her dances and loved her and Evanna for obvi reasons) 

Men: James H, Corbin, Riker, MILO, Juan Pablo, Corbin (Backup: James v)"
1579,2020-10-29 00:13:19,jjze8h,"I love your list!! I would nix Adam because he won his season. So swap in Kel. I would also choose Janel over Ally. And Heather Morris over either Candace or Sadie.

Great list!!"
1580,2020-10-29 02:04:23,jjze8h,"I think Emma should have kel but I did love her with James lol

I would nix Candace  and get Simone instead. Poor girl suffered through her season"
1581,2020-10-29 14:59:14,jjze8h,actually i see normani and alan but otherwise great pairings
1582,2020-10-29 17:24:34,jjze8h,"Unless it's the final season, I don't think we'll get another all-stars season.  The first one got really low viewership and affected the future seasons' ratings."
1583,2020-10-29 01:24:55,jjze8h,YES! And Daniella reminds me so much of Karina. Would love to see these two!
1584,2020-10-29 02:54:29,jjze8h,Yea... I find Candace annoying maybe it's the religion thing her and her brother do. Plus Simone and Sasha were cheated. Don't get me wrong love David Ross he was such a sweet nice guy but even he seemed thrown off.
1585,2020-10-29 17:36:29,jjze8h,"Huh, I wonder why that is! I would imagine that people would be more excited to see old favorites return than new people many don't know of. And since they would have mostly made it far in their seasons, an all star season would have better dancers overall which in my book makes it more fun to watch."
1586,2020-10-29 03:35:29,jjze8h,"Tbh I think it's more than the religion thing, she presents herself as a narcissist 
Like she's probably a sweet, kind girl but the way she presents herself with writing a lot of self help books, she seems like a narcissist"
1587,2020-10-29 14:45:20,jjze8h,"I'm not religious at all so I totally understand finding her annoying because of that. I guess I liked how she had a perspective totally different from mine....? I like when the cast has lots of different types of people. I felt similarly about Sadie. Though, they both had Mark who might be my favorite pro of all time so.... maybe I enjoyed watching then just because of him lol."
1588,2020-10-29 18:01:42,jjze8h,"I’ve heard the opposite, that the fact that almost everyone was so good already that viewers who liked watching a “journey” tuned out.  I personally loved the All-Star season because the level and quality of dancing was so much higher than the regular seasons.  Plus, we got to see the first all-female finale and they were all fantastic dancers.  I’d love to see another one but looking on the realistic side, we’re probably not getting it unless the show is in its last season and wants to go out in a bang."
1589,2020-10-31 15:16:46,jjze8h,"When we had Sadie, she never showed herself and or was problematic. They just made fun of Willie because of the modesty he wants for her but what father doesn't want that you know??? It was all fun and games with Willie"

I really can’t ever understand when complete strangers feel entitled to decide how someone ought to be acting in any given situation."

1653,2020-10-16 02:00:57,jbwoss,"Mine was a tad sooner - I’m gunna go with when she won the 2014 world beam title, at that point I figured injuries or bad management/coaching would be the only thing that’d stop her from becoming GOAT.  

At the time people were very weary of the burnout possibility (see literally every quad before, can’t remember a gymnast winning AA both the first year of the quad and the olympics, Nastia technically did, but the rounding placed her 2nd) so I think many softened their expectations.  But by 2015 it was confirmed imo."
1654,2020-10-16 06:04:42,jbwoss,"I had two. 2015 American Cup podium training had me shook. Especially her floor. I nearly shit my pants when she did her double double as her third pass, first out of shock (I was reallllllly not expecting that, no one had even really tried putting a Silivas [which was only recently becoming status quo for top floor workers] in the latter half) and then out of awe. That level of amazement held up until 2018, podium training at US Classics. I saw her dismount with a Silivas on floor and was like “wait no that’s illegal.” But then. Bars. My mind has never been so fucked. She was a completely different gymnast from 2016. Confidently hit her handstands, aggressive, upgraded routine. I don’t recall any other gymnastics moments as jawdropping."
1655,2020-10-15 21:35:03,jbwoss,"definitely 2015 for me. in 2013 Kyla was leading by like 0.8 going into the last rotation, in 2014 she nearly got beaten by Larisa - not enough people acknowledge how close she truly got. if you take her score from TF on beam and she doesn't go OOB on floor she wins by 0.034. her second place AA is much more impressive to me than Kyla or Katelyn beating simone in 2013, as for both of them Simone had an off day, but Larisa nearly beat a 4/4 hits simone.

in 2015 though she just *felt* untouchable"
1656,2020-10-15 22:30:32,jbwoss,"2015, for the same reason a lot of others said. Nationals that year she was just so far above the rest."
1657,2020-10-16 19:12:10,jbwoss,"My husband took our daughter to a level 10 meet in Arizona in which Simone competed years ago. They came home talking about how amazing this tiny little African-American girl named Simone was.  We saw her later at JO Nationals that year. I don’t think she placed very high, but her power and spunky was undeniable!"
1658,2020-10-16 04:47:37,jbwoss,"I think for me it was 2014 Secret Classic and FX.  I don't remember much about it other than her doing the Biles and sticking it cold. It was just being so amazing that I hauled my arse out of bed at 3am to drive to McDonalds and stream the World Championships from China (I didn't have internet at my house at the time). I knew I had to watch her compete again. I had to keep myself from squealing into my pancakes as Simone had instantly become my new favorite. I knew if she could stay healthy, she could be the Michelle Kwan of gymnastics. ;-) I might not have kept the ""Shut up, Al""s quiet though..."
1659,2020-10-16 13:21:10,jbwoss,"For me, after prelims at 2013 worlds. When she qualified to every final, I looked back at the previous gymnasts who did that, and realized she was almost certainly going to be something special. By the end of worlds that year, I remember feeling like the sky was the limit for her (as long as Martha didn't break her)."
1660,2020-10-15 23:35:23,jbwoss,"Rewatching the 2013 American Cup and Al says “This could be the new face of American gymnastics”. Such a clairvoyant, that Al!"
1661,2020-10-16 17:37:15,jbwoss,"She was obviously at the top of the game for the 2016 Olympics.  But legendary status?  When she came back after that Olympics and was throwing way harder stuff.  To me, the GOAT has to be legendary.  To have everyone say you are the best in the sport in 2016 and then you come back far and beyond better?  That's legendary.  That's being a GOAT.  Before, she was just great."
1662,2020-10-16 09:15:35,jbwoss,"and where was she before 2013? what happen between 2012 and 2013? was she abducted by an alien and received the power to become the GOAT?

(the alien part was a joke, but i am really curious about her pre 2013 since i am only following gymnastics from 2016)"
1663,2020-10-16 08:49:17,jbwoss,People doubted her a lot after her 2013 worlds win. Everyone was saying it was a fluke and that once Ohashi was healthy she’d kick her butt. By 2014 worlds most detractors were silenced. Very very very few people predicted her GOATness before 2013.
1664,2020-10-19 06:50:39,jbwoss,When she did that Amanar on the short track.
1665,2020-10-20 23:22:30,jbwoss,"2012 I knew she was one to watch, 2013 worlds I knew she was special, 2014 I knew she was gonna go down in history."
1666,2020-10-19 00:29:21,jbwoss,"I remember watching Simone at the American Cup in 2013. I never would’ve guessed she had the ability difficulty-wise that she has now back then. Not bc Simone didn’t win that meet or because she fell on beam. Just back then she wasn’t flying as high or executing as well. 

Sadly, I think this is where someone like Marta Karolyi excelled. Marta could spot talent in athletes, like Simone and Gabby and also Kyla Ross. All the talk was about how Marta liked Gabby as an athlete, within 2 years Gabby was Olympic AA champion. Never won a world or national title before, but bam Gabby wins gold. 

I’ve watched Simone perform as a junior. She was in the top 3 often and won some AA/Event titles, but so were so many gymnasts, lots of them never made senior careers for themselves. 

When I watch gymnasts like Konnor McClain and Leanne Wong, even Skye Blakely, I wonder if they’re being given the resources to succeed. 

I was really disappointed Konnor was left off the junior worlds team in 2019. Leaving her off, just because she faltered in the qualifying meet was a ridiculous strategy. It could also negatively affect her abilities in the future, considering that a competition like that would have given Konnor some much needed experience. Selecting teams should be nuanced. It’s as though the new USAG just wants to appear as non-Karolyi as possible, when we all know it’s still the same in a lot of detrimental ways. If it wasn’t, why would it take 4 years of back and forth to put an elite coach on probation."
1667,2020-10-15 21:59:31,jbwoss,"Agreed. It was obvious she was special before 2015 - you don't get to 2 Worlds titles without being special - but not SIMONE special quite yet.

I think for me, it was 2015 Nationals Day 2 when she cracked the 63 mark. Obviously there were some minor domestic scoring shenanigans going on a little, but it was still an absolutely bonkers day for her. And no one else even cracked 60 at that meet at all."
1668,2020-10-16 06:05:56,jbwoss,"I’m not sure if I agree. She was definitely labeled the GOAT in 2015, especially during worlds and after her threepeat."
1669,2020-10-16 03:56:55,jbwoss,"Yeah, there's something to this... when she arrived at 2018 Nationals and was first on every event, that was maybe when it was truly clear that her gymnastics had evolved beyond the competition that mere mortals play at."
1670,2020-10-16 07:32:59,jbwoss,Sae Miyakawa dismounted with a Silivas in [2015](https://youtu.be/GxV1-9UJM-4)
1671,2020-10-19 02:26:59,jbwoss,"Agreed.  Simone was labeled as one of the great ones when she was around 12 and won fx at JO Nationals.  The problem was she was from an unknown gym and couldn't put a bar routine together at the same level as her peers until she was older.  Marta and Co. knew she was probably the most talented along with Katelyn when they were 11/12, but it took a few years for Simone to show nothing was going to hold her back."
1672,2020-10-16 14:12:19,jbwoss,Sometimes I forget that Simone was 4th on bars in 2013... in a final where Queen Mustafina was 3rd (granted she downgraded but still).
1673,2020-10-16 03:54:57,jbwoss,"Yeah, but didn't he say that about everyone?

Even a broken clock... etc etc."
1674,2020-10-16 14:43:15,jbwoss,"She began competing elite as a junior in 2011. 2013 was her first year as a senior. She did reasonably well 2011-12 as a junior, making the national team in the latter. But I doubt very much anyone saw her as a GOAT at that point. Instead she was being well paced by Aimee Boorman. And she started seeing a sports psychologist after 2013 Classics to help her mental game."
1675,2020-10-22 20:35:39,jbwoss,So you don't think Konnor should have to earn her spot on the team? She failed to qualify for the team and deserved to be left home.
1676,2020-10-16 01:16:13,jbwoss,2015 Worlds was also where we saw her make a largeish error (on beam) and still comfortably win the AA title.
1677,2020-10-17 02:12:09,jbwoss,"Agreed. In 2014 Worlds she beat Larissa for the AA title, but if I recall correctly, Larissa had at least a fighting chance - I think she scored like a 59.7 and Simone *just* broke 60 (she had like a 60.1). Simone was the favorite to win, but it wasn't a foregone conclusion that she'd wipe the floor with her competition. 

2015 Nationals was when I think it became really apparent that Simone is peerless, and 2015 Worlds is when it became clear to me that she was clearly the GOAT. (As an aside, I watched the video from 2015 SCAM and I totally forgot that Skinner competed that meet! Wild.)"
1678,2020-10-15 22:17:30,jbwoss,"Yeah, I can totally see that being your moment."
1679,2020-10-17 20:37:45,jbwoss,"I was going to point that out. While mind-boggling, Sae’s was lower and she ended up switching the Silivas and double layout."
1680,2020-10-17 23:52:03,jbwoss,"I remember in 2013 i didn’t get the hype around her. I thought she had  a amazing vault set and difficult floor set, but didn’t think she was unbeatable. 2014 came around and her beam was world class and her floor got insane I though yeah they can’t caught her. Not to mention her massive vault that was untouchable."
1681,2020-10-14 21:14:16,jb9q7x,"They need to tumble and flip and stuff, and being smaller makes that easier.  Less weight to move, more of it closer to their center of mass, etc."
1682,2020-10-14 22:09:31,jb9q7x,"Without knowing anything about the sport or ""weight groups""

Essentially, it takes more energy and time to quickly move/flip/rotate a longer body than a shorter one. That being said, that does not take the tens of thousands of training into account."
1683,2020-10-16 09:25:58,jb9q7x,"The main thing is that not every gym actually knows how to train elites and the ones that do tend to choose kids that are short in the first place.  Added to that, elite gymnasts tend to have delayed growth because of the training combined with a restricted diet.  Also, there is a perception of gymnasts being shorter as a group because gymnasts compete both before and after puberty.  At 16 a gymnast might be 4'11"".  Four years later, she could be 5'2"" but the information won't always get corrected.  

I think Simone would be really short even if she wasn't a gymnast.  Not all gymnasts are that short.  Here is the [2018 US team with the 2018 Russian team](https://www.alamy.com/doha-qatar-30th-oct-2018-the-gold-medalist-team-of-the-america-red-and-the-silver-medalist-team-of-russia-blue-pose-after-the-womens-team-final-at-the-2018-fig-artistic-gymnastics-world-championships-in-doha-capital-of-qatar-oct-30-2018-credit-nikkuxinhuaalamy-live-news-image223678181.html).  All of the Russians and half the Americans that year were about 5'3"".  Only three of these gymnasts are 4'11"" or shorter."
1684,2020-10-14 21:21:05,jb9q7x,They exercise like 24/7. They don't even have periods.
1685,2020-10-14 22:10:52,jb9q7x,"Ah yes, all that exercise making your bones shorter..."
1686,2020-10-12 18:34:23,j9upru,A few more old school contestants and pros pls <3 GIVE ME MEL B. Also for the pros give me Lacey and Edyta pleeeease
1687,2020-10-13 00:04:41,j9upru,"I know Val has had short women before, but I think Simone is too short for him."
1688,2020-10-12 17:11:26,j9upru,I can't help but feel like you must have something against both Paige and Sasha to stick Paige with Gleb and leave Sasha off altogether... especially when they would clearly be amazing together.
1689,2020-10-13 05:07:37,j9upru,"Oh please don't do that to Frankie, give him to anyone else."
1690,2020-10-13 01:44:57,j9upru,How tall is Brandon? Zendaya is 5’10”.
1691,2020-10-13 10:46:26,j9upru,How you gonna do Frankie like that? Noooo!
1692,2020-10-28 14:02:55,j9upru,"Juan Pablo and Daniella would be a dream team!!!!

I would want Corbin and Lindsay together 
And Witney with riker 

Sharna with Frankie

Jenna with James H

Nick Carter with Emma"
1693,2020-10-13 01:23:34,j9upru,"Lacey, Edyta and Chelsie Hightower! I always rooted for Edyta because I’m Polish haha. I’d love to see her again with someone who actually has a chance to win."
1694,2020-10-12 18:58:22,j9upru,Oh yes I would definitely love some old pros especially Mark but I was thinking more along the lines of the current cast because I doubt they could get the old ones back 🙁
1695,2020-10-13 00:33:28,j9upru,That’s true! I didn’t even think about height differences.
1696,2020-10-12 18:55:40,j9upru,No omg Sasha is actually my favorite!! I can’t believe I left him out. I would definitely pick Sasha over Gleb!!
1697,2020-10-12 18:58:30,j9upru,And Gleb is horrible. He puts in 0 effort unless he think his partner is worth his time he's a terrible teacher lately I haven't liked his choreography. With Sasha he tried regardless of who his partner is and his partners always seem to have a good time.
1698,2020-10-13 17:47:28,j9upru,I think maybe I would switch and do Frankie and Lindsay Nick and Jenna ? I wish it could be Frankie and Whit again but had to switch them up!
1699,2020-10-13 16:08:01,j9upru,Okay I totally agree! Frankie 100% deserves better than Jenna. I just can’t see him dancing with anyone in particular so I panicked haha
1700,2020-10-12 22:28:17,j9upru,Lol well I agree with all the rest of your pairings! I would LOVE to see Lindsey and Artem together and Pasha and Ally would be amazing.
1701,2020-10-12 19:01:05,j9upru,Yes I totally agree!!! Sasha is my favorite current male pro right now & glebs choreography is soooo boring!! I just had a dumb moment 😂

We know that's not true, and it creates embarrassing cringey situations. No, gay men can be just as boring as anyone else!"
1739,2020-12-07 02:22:36,k795ey,One word: Money
1740,2020-12-17 10:31:36,k795ey,Lmao 😂
1741,2020-12-05 23:43:16,k795ey,Because it plays in to the stereotype. No gay people I know act like him. They are just regular people who work every day at jobs they hate too and live their lives without telling the entire world what they do in the bedroom. The vast majority of gay people don't run around scream YASSSSS QUEEN!!! at every opportunity.
1742,2020-12-07 04:07:54,k795ey,Oh yeah I’m sure it goes both ways lol 😆
1743,2020-12-07 04:10:14,k795ey,And to be honest it’s still not even entertaining so it’s still boring ig
1744,2020-12-06 02:46:17,k795ey,"Oh yeah, the screaming gets on my nerves too after a while...and yes, even the queeniest gay men I know don't act like that, ever. 

However, I'd love to have him cut my hair!"
1745,2020-12-06 05:56:33,k795ey,"I'm pan, I have never in my life thought to say yass queen

More like, ""I don't care man I just want to go home,"" internally"
1746,2020-12-06 06:21:16,k795ey,Yep. The vast majority of us lead lives of quiet desperation all the same.
1747,2020-12-02 18:21:17,k5e0x7,"I agree that due to upgrades, there will be many routines with very high difficulty values, but I wonder if there will also be an increase in the % of falls (especially on beam and bars) as a result. Thus, while there is a surge in difficulty, there might be a slight decrease in execution, which would balance things out a bit. Thoughts?"
1748,2020-12-02 18:21:53,k5e0x7,Oh I hope Andrade is at full health and earns herself an Olympic berth! I do love this qualification system in that it makes competitions like Pan Ams high stakes!
1749,2020-12-02 18:26:41,k5e0x7,"> Thus, while there is a surge in difficulty, there might be a slight decrease in execution, which would balance things out a bit. Thoughts?

The judges might also be more lenient, as they often are in the Olympic year. So I expect the scores to be higher despite the execution problems that often come with higher D scores"
1750,2020-12-02 23:01:55,k5e0x7,"Also to add, with 2005 babies in the mix, I am wondering if that may contribute to the falls too.  With the 2005 athletes not pacing themselves for the Tokyo Olympics so they are pushing themselves in difficulty to peak earlier than they planned."
1751,2020-12-02 21:00:56,k5e0x7,I applaud OPs optimism with regards to Andrade. I love Andrade and I really hope OP is right.
1752,2020-12-03 14:10:45,k5e0x7,I really feel like Pak Ams should be a walk in the park for her. The only way I see it not working out is (1) if it’s cancelled or (2) if the all-around world cups are cancelled so USA sends top all-arounders to Pan Ams and Canada sends Ellie Black. Even then Andrade really should be favored to beat Ellie Black even if Andrade is only at 75% difficulty
1753,2020-12-03 21:30:54,k5e0x7,"The one thing about Andrade that worries me is she’s had 3 ACL injuries. She comes back, looks, amazing, ACL injury and repeat. I want her to do well but I also worry her ligaments are like cooked spaghetti at this point."
1754,2020-12-02 04:36:41,k4zwys,"I just want to understand the premise. What are they trying to say? What is the pitch to use Uber Eats?

It's difficult to know how your parents will react. What I can advice though, is finding and building friends / a support network of people who accept you for who you are, all aspects of you.

Internet strangers can be nice, but friends you can talk with, even better.

Again, congrats on coming out!"
1765,2020-12-01 14:13:52,k4ggxm,Congrats on coming out!  It’s never easy but a courageous act letting others know about yourself.  Allow your parents to process the information and let them know if they have any questions to feel free to ask and talk about it with you
1766,2020-12-01 15:19:13,k4ggxm,"They did not grab the bible and chase you out of the house. That is a start. Give them time to process the information. If anything bad was going to come from this it would have already happened. Relax ,Enjoy Life. Quit worrying about what may happen and deal with things as they happen."
1767,2020-12-01 19:46:22,k4ggxm,"It can often take time for people to process this new information. As others have said, not getting a highly negative response means that there is hope. Also, speaking as a parent, it is hard not to see your child and have a picture form in your mind about how they may be when they grow up. Some parents are more open-minded and 'go with the flow' and others have a harder time letting go of their image. It sounds like your dad is more go with the flow and your mom, especially being more religious or traditional, may hopefully need some time to adjust from her image for you to reality. Give her some time with this, also maybe your dad can help by talking with her.

Meanwhile, please consider yourself hugged and accepted by this Bi dad! 🤗🤗🤗💙❤💜"

Also me watching Simone throw amazing new skills: 'Girl pls take all the medals that exist thanks xx'"
1778,2020-11-20 22:10:41,jxy219,Okay someone more knowledgeable than me has to break down this craziness
1779,2020-11-20 23:04:54,jxy219,Does anyone know why Simone goes for crazy pike skills instead of tucked?  Like for the double back piked vault/triple pike on floor.  Is it just because she's that good so she might as well try the harder skill or are pikes easier for her?
1780,2020-11-21 00:06:24,jxy219,The double badk to double back 😻
1781,2020-11-20 23:33:22,jxy219,I want the Biles II on vault to be a thing so badly
1782,2020-11-21 03:43:02,jxy219,"Ugh, that Biles to front layout 😍"
1783,2020-11-24 18:05:22,jxy219,I would LOVE to see the piked double back competed on vault.  How fun would that be.
1784,2020-11-21 11:51:45,jxy219,There's white text at the bottom of the video breaking out every skill she did. It's a bit hard to see.
1785,2020-11-21 00:07:27,jxy219,Pike position can give you more control on your flip-if she was doing tucks I think she’d rotate too fast.
1786,2020-11-20 23:13:01,jxy219,"Seconding this question. They aren't worth more, correct?"
1787,2020-11-21 15:10:59,jxy219,"She generates so much power and rotates so fast that she’s be at risk of over-rotation.  It’s why I think the Prudonova would be dangerous for her - most gymnasts don’t get it all the way round, but I suspect she’d probably be rotating so fast she’d be a risk of landing too far forward."
1788,2020-11-21 18:21:16,jxy219,"I don't know if she's tried the Yurchenko double tucked on vault, but I do remember seeing old footage of her doing a triple back tuck on floor somewhere. So at least in terms of the triple back tuck on fx, the piked version is an upgrade of sorts for Simone."
1789,2020-11-21 13:21:45,jxy219,"Imo that was the most insane thing she did in this, I cannot even imagine how mindblowing actually competing that would be"
1790,2020-11-21 23:58:32,jxy219,"Thanks for the reference! I did see that. As a casual watcher rather that former gymnast, I only have a vague sense of what these mean in terms of difficulty and whether it has been done before. For example, are only those not in the code “new”?"
1791,2020-11-20 23:59:50,jxy219,"No, but the piked position gives you MUCH more situational control. The tucked position is the easiest to rotate in because you're a tiny ball with a lot of momentum whereas in the piked position, you create more drag and therefore are more in control of your rotational axis and your ability to land safely."
1792,2020-11-21 18:29:30,jxy219,"In men's gymnastics, at least, a Yurchenko double piked (a piked Melissanidis) is 5.6, while the Yurchenko double tucked (also originated by Melissanidis) is worth 5.2. Similarly, a Roche (the MAG version of the Produnova, a handspring double front tucked vault) is 5.2, while the piked version, the Blanik, is 5.6

We don't know how it'll be rated in WAG, of course, since no woman has even competed a Yurchenko double tucked. But the piked version should probably be worth .4 more.

And when it comes to men's floor, no one has competed a piked version of the Liukin (triple back tucked). I've seen a few different gymnasts try it in training. It would almost certainly be rated higher than the Liukin (an H-element), it'd probably get an I.

_____

It's only on the easier end of the skill table, such as a double back salto on floor, where the tuck/pike versions are worth the same in both men's and women's gymnastics. Once you go higher up the table, though, the FIG seems to think that doing things piked makes enough of a difference to give it a higher start value."
1793,2021-03-02 12:58:32,jxy219,The fact that this is our worry shows how good she is
1794,2020-11-21 15:29:55,jxy219,Thank you!
1795,2020-11-22 01:17:30,jxy219,"Yes.. This this this!  Not that I'm anywhere or was near the zip code of an elite gymnast, but when I was learning a double front on a trampoline, I was so scared of doing the double tuck front, because it felt out of control, always over rotating, because of so much momentum, landing on my stomach from it,  and then over correcting and literally opening up 2 early and landing on my back.  Literally, the first time I tried doing a double pike I landed it perfectly, like it was nothing. The double tuck front not even close."

1806,2020-12-25 14:32:56,kjzqb4,I read somewhere that no country makes money hosting the game.
1807,2020-12-25 14:24:58,kjzqb4,I agree that the contemporary model for hosting isn’t sustainable. And I also agree that the spirt of amateurism is gone. But “disgusting and terrible”? Nah.
1808,2020-12-25 14:40:49,kjzqb4,So you are angry at sports in general it seems...

1811,2020-12-25 18:03:22,kjzqb4,At the London Olympics the stadium used for beach volleyball ball was a temporary structure. It was built in the Horse Guards Parade and then dismantled after the games were over. I thought this was a great idea.

1815,2020-12-25 14:43:05,kjzqb4,It’s amazing that they fight to host the games.
1816,2020-12-25 14:41:25,kjzqb4,Places like Vancouver and Atlanta hosted very well. So did Montreal in ‘76 and Los Angeles. Athens and Rio are two examples off the top of my head of cities that didn’t. But I think the Olympic committee should consider the sustainability of the host cities bid to an extent greater than they probably do.

1823,2020-12-23 21:10:15,kj149r,yea

1827,2021-01-08 08:50:50,kj13r5,She’s completely different body type to Simone.
1828,2021-01-08 08:20:06,kj13r5,"I think it’s way more likely that it’s Gabby. Simone doesn’t have time to go on this show, she’s currently training for the Olympics lol. Gabby isn’t training gymnastics anymore. Gabby also lived with a host family in a different state from her family while she was training for the 2012 Olympics, which fits one of the clues. She also has three gold medals, hence the “3” on the dumbbells, and she was in a commercial eating cornflakes while in a split, and there was a bowl or cornflakes in her segment."
1829,2021-01-07 12:47:59,kj13r5,i guess
1830,2021-01-10 03:15:45,kj13r5,Agreed
1831,2021-01-08 16:13:17,kj13r5,"Yes Simone is training for the next Olympics, no way she would take a break for a dancing show that most likely had an iron clad contract for post show appearances and tours. That would make the necessary training for the Olympics near impossible.  Plus the other clues don’t point to Simone: host family, cupcakes, clock, etc..  Not to mention, the body type is all wrong for Simone. Agree that Gabby is the most likely person."
1832,2020-12-20 18:31:20,kgz7x2,"If you’re talking about [this one](https://youtu.be/4LopWnCmPnI), I think it’s very obvious. 

Van Ness acts like a very stereotypically effeminate male, a stereotype a lot of people hold about both gay men and male gymnasts."
1833,2020-12-20 19:09:12,kgz7x2,"I'm gay and I wouldn't say I find it insulting. Out of context it looks like it goes with the stereotype of gay men being very effeminate but only because the viewer either knows he's gay and connects that to his femininity, or doesn't know he's gay and jumps to the conclusion that he must be because he's feminine. But the commercial doesn't say or imply he's gay, and he's not acting any different than he does in other settings. So even though he might fit a stereotype, he's not a stereotype, he's being himself.

If the commercial was an effeminate=gay/gay=effeminate type of thing that'd be different. If it was played by a man, regardless of sexual orientation, who isn't effeminate but is acting effeminate for the commercial and it's being said or implied that he's gay, I'd definitely have an issue with it as it's just playing a stereotype often in a mocking way. But I've seen some of Queer Eye and seen Jonathan outside of it and that seems to be just the way he is, so I don't see a problem with him being shown that way in the commercial.

That said, I don't really understand the commercial. I don't know what he's doing there. I've seen the other commercial with Mark Hamill and Patrick Stewart and it makes sense to me, they're both actors, they're presented as one vs the other and their dialogue is coherent with that. With the gymnastics one, I've looked it up and apparently he does do some amateur gymnastics, but I don't think that's something the average viewer will know (if they know the man at all) so it just feels like he's out of place to me. Some commercials look random or have unexpected twists but they work. This one doesn't, in my opinion.

So yeah, the commercial has nothing to do with him being gay, and I don't care if some effeminate gay men are visible in media because they do exist and deserve the same respect (although I'd like to see some more masculine gay men representation), so I don't have any particular opinion on that front... but I do find it an awkward and kind of annoying commercial. I'm sure others love it, it's just my personal preference in terms of commercials.

Note: I think he said he's non-binary so some will say it's not even ""an effeminate man"" that's in the commercial, but realistically, most people won't even know that about him and will see a man. I only found that out just know when looking up if he does any gymnastics."

1838,2020-12-20 14:31:30,kglyab,Dudes apparently never seen a competitive swimmer either. And he’d probably complain about the lack of curves on the cyclists.
1839,2020-12-20 13:03:46,kglyab,Wtf? Has he never seen any of those ‘the geometric shape you most resemble dictates what kind of clothes/diet/etc you should have’ posts? Women come a variety of shapes. (Usually between four and seven depending on what they’re trying to sell you.)

1841,2020-12-20 14:46:00,kglyab,I (Cis F) have linebacker shoulders. Add that to my large breasts and finding shirts is not fun at all...
1842,2020-12-20 17:08:31,kglyab,People aren't all born with naturally wide Kim Kardashian hips smh some of us have hip dips n shite
1843,2020-12-20 18:07:48,kglyab,"This reminds of this one asshole who told me ""Imagine how great Serena Williams would be if she got in shape."""
1844,2020-12-20 14:53:28,kglyab,"As a man,I dunno which women he is talking about but i would kill to be like them!

I want GAINZ-"
1845,2020-12-20 15:05:44,kglyab,"Me, who only reason i don't look ridiculously broad shouldered, is because i am overweight, and tend to gain weight in the hips, ass, and leg, i am still a inverter triangle, just a slightly fat one, my shoulders are still wider then my hips though, i have the average shoulders width for a man, i am not a man, at a healthy weight i would look even more broad"

1847,2021-01-27 17:37:30,kglyab,Another IG troll who probably built like Danny Devito when he played as Penguin in Batman Returns
1848,2020-12-20 15:45:14,kglyab,"I learned my shoulders are broader than my broad hips while making some art for a performance class. I was cutting big oval shapes out of plywood to the dimensions of my body. I had one as tall as me and the width of my hips.. I held it up in front of me and got my bro to take a picture...well damn if my shoulders weren't poking out either side lol!
I was on swim team for many years but I still think it's a normal thing."
1849,2020-12-21 07:56:40,kglyab,To be honest I always thought shoulders were supposed to be wider than hips because I got some broad ass shoulders dude
1850,2020-12-20 03:16:48,kglyab,Apparently being an inverted triangle is a brand new concept to some people
1851,2020-12-20 04:30:03,kglyab,"I understand what he’s saying. I’m a retired gymnast myself, and if you look at Olympic gymnasts like Simone biles, then they do have a noticeable shape. 

Not so much hips more narrow than shoulders, it’s more of the combination of broad shoulders, very narrow hips, and often the hips aren’t much wider than the waist. 

The idiot speaking in the pic obviously knows jack shit about gymnastics lol. Though I can see why people would consider it odd—it’s a more unusual shape, a less common shape. And in the case of Olympic-level gymnasts it stems from a combination of stunted growth, genetics, little to no excess fat, and muscle. 

The guy insulting it can shut tf up though. People are self conscious enough without him being a prick."
1852,2020-12-20 04:27:32,kglyab,I'm built like fucking Tinkerbell and my hips are barely wider than my shoulders. My torso is tiny but shoulders are still one of if not the widest part of your body
1853,2020-12-20 22:15:48,kglyab,*ehm ehm HENTAI ehm ehm* if you look at some girls there they look like that.
1854,2020-12-20 07:16:23,kglyab,"Right, he’s so concerned for the body of a top tier olympic athlete because it doesn’t fit his perception of normal"
1855,2020-12-20 07:17:26,kglyab,"Literally. She’s probably the most well known olympian too, or one of the most well known. Muscles are a thing that exist"
1856,2020-12-20 11:28:16,kglyab,Women aren't supposed to have muscles /s
1857,2020-12-20 18:45:22,kglyab,"Right there with you, Sis.  I (also Cis F) am built just like this.  Never had a problem finding guys, tho ...  Weird, isn't it?  It's like guys *who are not incels* exist!  \*GASP\*

Fucking incels."
1858,2020-12-20 18:08:10,kglyab,you’re kidding... someone actually said that
1859,2020-12-20 15:20:03,kglyab,"My body shape is some cursed amalgamation of inverted triangle, hourglass,  and pear."
1860,2020-12-20 08:31:47,kglyab,Haaaaa
1861,2020-12-20 04:34:43,kglyab,"This pretty much sums it up. I have the same body type as her (not at all as athletic or talented, I just have man shoulders and tiny hips) and seeing someone hate on an olympian just made me realize how much people don’t know about women’s bodies"
1862,2020-12-20 04:47:06,kglyab,It’s really not unusual or uncommon. People have just been brainwashed to think women should all have hourglass or pear shapes. It’s the only body types prominent in media. There are Plenty of women who have broad shoulders and narrow hips. It only looks odd on Simone because of the amount of muscle in her torso. Inverted triangle and apple shaped women are abundant.
1863,2020-12-20 11:26:10,kglyab,Look at the shape of female swimmers and divers..also wide shoulders
1864,2020-12-21 04:29:56,kglyab,"Yep. His examples of 'in shape' were Maria Sharapova and Anna Kournikova. So basically, tall and slender."
1865,2020-12-20 17:04:55,kglyab,"It's not ""cursed"" at all. What's cursed is whoever thought it would be a good idea to categorise women's bodies into 4 neat categories when leads of women's bodies probably don't fit ""pear"", ""hourglass"" and whatever the others are."
1866,2020-12-20 19:39:12,kglyab,Same. I’m otherwise petite but I’m a broad shouldered broad. With a long torso. Pear bottom. Finding clothes is hilarious.
1867,2020-12-20 04:58:24,kglyab,"The part that’s ‘odd’ that I was referring to is the more ‘extreme’ version of the inverted triangle body shape that Simone has (with her muscle mass giving her more visual weight in her shoulders/upper torso). That’s why I mentioned Olympic gymnasts, and noted their muscle adding to that shape. 

Inverted triangle is a common body shape. Just as hourglass and pears are. The body shape of an Olympic gymnast is a bit more extreme, and less common."
1868,2020-12-20 17:11:54,kglyab,"I saw a picture a few years ago of a bunch of our women Olympic athletes, and they all had the same body type--wide shoulders, and very little difference between hip and waist circumference.  It's an athletic body type."
1869,2020-12-21 10:38:51,kglyab,wow... it’s almost like there’s different shapes
1870,2020-12-21 10:39:58,kglyab,"and both of those women are white too. Maybe he didn’t mean it that way, but they are the beauty standard for a reason"
1871,2020-12-20 17:16:47,kglyab,"Touché

When you're hips too wide to be an inverted triangle and your shoulders too large to be an hour glass, whatever you have left is treated as ""not normal"""
1872,2020-12-20 23:13:51,kglyab,"I hear you!

I am usually two different sizes simultaneously according to those sizing guides."
1873,2020-12-20 07:15:31,kglyab,"Oh of course her body is less common. She’s literally the top of her sport, and an incredible olympian with the medals and reputation to prove it. Her body is almost impossible to achieve under normal circumstances and it’s an amazing thing that shows off her talent, it’s the fact that she’s still being body shamed despite being such a well known athlete... she’s definitely taking care of it but it’ll never be enough for people like the commenter.

(also mad respect to you dude, I used to do gymnastics but probably not as seriously as you did! it wasn’t my thing but man, after getting my butt handed to me for years, i’ve got so much respect for people that do it)"
1874,2020-12-20 14:25:49,kglyab,"Lol, thanks! I was nowhere near-Olympian level, but I was in competitive for years. I had my butt handed to me several times too! Haha.

And people like the commenter are probably the same incels who think women should all come two standard shapes, that just ‘happen’ to be the shape he prefers in a woman smh."
