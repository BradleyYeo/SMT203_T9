Thiem: word."
11,2020-02-04 11:41:38,eyna2v,"He's not wrong. They do need a different approach. She has been trying the same style constantly. Go big on returns, go big on her serves and her own shots and hope that she's playing well or her opponent rolls over which happens plenty in the WTA.

Can she win with this style? Sure. Especially Wimbledon. But she could also work hard, lose a little weight so she's a bit quicker on the court and doesn't lose so many of the longer rallies. If she's better in the longer rallies she's gonna easily run through the WTA again 'cause of her big serve."
12,2020-02-04 09:23:52,eyna2v," ""She does feel positive, she feels negative too because it is a failure when she doesn't win a Grand Slam "". This sums up this interview and Patrick's discourse in general. Not saying anything new, just wanting attention."
13,2020-02-04 16:00:59,eyna2v,Maybe she needs a new coach. Hire Navratilova to help with her fitness and improve her lately inconsistent serve and improve her transition game to end points at net
14,2020-02-04 13:05:12,eyna2v,"Ah, so taking testosteron isn't working for her anymore. Sorry to hear that."
15,2020-02-05 03:24:28,eyna2v,"Yeah Patrick, she needs to face reality and fire your thirsty ass!"

18,2020-02-04 16:16:46,eyna2v,"She did lose a lot of weight over the past year. This AO has been the fittest I've seen her in ages, including pre baby.

Makes me believe that this is exactly what she was told after Andreescu and Halep blasted her off the court in consecutive slams"
19,2020-02-04 11:57:04,eyna2v,"I haven't really followed women's tennis, but I would imagine that would be Serena's best shot at winning now. She's no spring chicken at this point and if she gets into a long rally it's going to be hard to keep up with the young players, even if she does lose some weight/get her fitness up to par. 

Really pounding the ball is what I would consider her best shot, but I'm shit at tennis and only an idiot would listen to my advice."
20,2020-02-04 22:18:50,eyna2v,[deleted]
21,2020-02-04 23:13:37,eyna2v,"Honestly...if I were her coach, I would tell her to play like a servebot. Lay off the  long rallies and save your strength  for service games. It is such a nuclear bomb of a weapon. 

She likely would have would have beat Wang (haha) if she nailed more first serves at the end, but she gets tired and it effects her accuracy."
22,2020-02-04 15:16:02,eyna2v,I wouldn't wanna be her training telling her she might benifit from loosing weight.
23,2020-02-04 13:12:36,eyna2v,"He seems to be a great coach, and run a good tennis academy, but, man, do I really not like that guy."
24,2020-02-04 14:01:18,eyna2v,"Nah man.

They coudln't find anything when she was hiding in the panic room, this must prove she's totally cleanz."
25,2020-02-04 23:10:26,eyna2v,Speaking from someone who has issues with weight...it is definitely a factor.
26,2020-02-04 14:54:00,eyna2v,How come you don‚Äôt like him?
27,2020-02-04 15:37:16,eyna2v,He's just constantly in a state of self-promotion.

I said males who have transitioned to female shouldnt be a part of womens sports because it creates an unfair advantage. My gf and my roommate are pissed at me. Aita?

The title explains it all. 'Did they train any less hard?' is the question my opposition has? 'How many men would beat Serena Williams?'
My response was... If they trained equally as hard then would Serena have a disadvantage? They want stats but of course that is a hard number to come up with. 

I just think it's unfair, even after testasterone blockers because people born men still have the muscle memory, will always have a bigger heart and larger bone structure.

My (long distance) girlfriend dropped communication and when i told my roommate that we were essentially fighting over it, i discovered that her and her friend were also opposing my view. Now i'm feeling crazy but i dont feel like I am. It just doesnt seem fair to female athletes. I want to apologize to all the trans people on reddit. I have nothing against people identifying with what makes them comfortable and trying to enjoy life in a body they didnt want. I just think there is a hard line between men and women sports that is there for a reason. I know this is a touchy subject and it wont be easy to incorporate new rules to make everyone happy.

33,2020-02-02 18:20:08,expopj,Didnt Serena win a title earlier this January in Auckland? So she is a champion in 4 decades im pretty sure
34,2020-02-02 16:18:35,expopj,Sampras 1990-2002. Technically decade lasts since year 1 to year 10.
35,2020-02-02 15:30:02,expopj,Only impressed really with Serena‚Äôs as it‚Äôs over 18 years.
36,2020-02-02 18:21:08,expopj,Major title.
37,2020-02-02 16:27:09,expopj,"There is no ""technically"", every date is arbitrary. There is no universal truth. Since it is majority's opinion people count it as 2020-2029, you're just entitled to your fringe opinion. If you ever write an ESPN article, you can count is as 2021-2030."
38,2020-02-02 18:22:14,expopj,"I missed that detail, still impressive 4 decades in titles"
39,2020-02-03 04:28:05,expopj,"I mean, the whole decade thing is arbitrary.  It's far too big a Target to be meaningful.  Two players can both have won in 2 decades, and one had titles 1 year apart, with the other at 19 years apart.  That's an absolutely enormous difference.

3 decades just means somewhere between 12 years and 29.  Both Rafa and Fed have more total years between their first and most recent GSs."
40,2020-02-02 17:05:09,expopj,"I mean I count 0‚Äì9 too but yes there is an ""official"" truth."
41,2020-02-02 19:13:45,expopj,"There's no truth or lie, mathematical calendar decade is always from year 1 to 10, but in a cultural/historical way of things, people talk about years 0 to 9 as a decade.
Both are correct."
42,2020-02-02 00:44:50,exe5ro,"This is hardly controversial. 


1. Graf won 22 Grand Slams. Serena won 23 Grand Slams.


2. Graf was more dominant. She won 22 Grand Slams between 1988-1999.  Serena had a longer career. She won her first Grand Slam in 1999 and last her Grand Slam win was in 2017. 

3. Graf won 4 Aus, 5 US, 6 French and 7 Wim. Serena won 3 French, 6 US, 7 Aus and 7 Wim. 

4. Graf has a career record of 88.7% while Serena has a career record of 85.4%.

5. Graf won 107 career titles. Serena won 72 career titles.

6. Graf was number one 377 weeks. Serena was number one for 317 weeks.

7. Graf reached 13 consecutive Grand Slam finals. Serena reached 4 consecutive Grand Slam finals. 

8. Graf was year end number one for 8 years. Serena was year end number one for 5 years. 

9. Graf‚Äôs winning streak was better. Serena has never 40+ consecutive matches even once. Graf did it 4 times ( 44 consecutive matches, 45 consecutive matches, 46 consecutive matches and 66 consecutive matches) 

10. Graf‚Äôs best year winning percentages are 97.7%, 97.4% and 96%. Serena‚Äôs best is 95.1%. 

11. Graf won all 4 Grand Slams in one year. She was the last tennis player to achieve that.

12. Graf beat her opponent 6-0 6-0 in a Grand Slam final. Only time that has ever happened in a Grand Slam final.

13. Graf won 20 Grand Slams between 1988-1996. That is a kind of dominance even Federer would be proud of. 

14. Graf won at least one Grand Slam every year for 10 straight years. Serena won at least one Grand Slam every year for 6 straight years. 

15. Graf won three Grand Slams in a year four times. Serena did it twice. 

16. Statistically speaking, Graf has a better record than Graf 




P. S : 

1.Martina Navartilova and Chris Evert were just as good. They won 18 Grand Slams each despite having playing each other. If they toured Australia more and had the level of competition Graf or Serena had, they would have around the same number of Grand Slams that Serena or Graf won.

2. Maureen Connolly is arguably the GOAT. She competed in 11 Grand Slams and won 9 of them. Forgotten name. Most dominant career ever"
43,2020-02-01 23:02:42,exe5ro,cool
44,2020-02-02 04:41:25,exe5ro,she's not wrong. it is not as clear cut as people think.

47,2020-02-01 23:43:51,exe5ro,You know 77 years is a long enough life I think
48,2020-02-01 23:54:56,exe5ro,"For all the crap that she's said, she would probably at least have a somewhat informed opinion about tennis itself. Many people do believe that Graf was better so this isn't controversial."
49,2020-02-02 15:41:26,exe5ro,"Graf is a legend but I would put Martina above her due to longevity, doubles success, and her biggest rival not being stabbed/taken out the game during her peak (I know this isn‚Äôt steffi‚Äôs fault) 
Serena has but the on court results and the off court impact (she‚Äôs been huge in the push for black girls and boys to pick up racquets)
But ultimately this goat conversation is subjective and everyone is entitled to their opinion."
50,2020-02-02 05:34:24,exe5ro,"Why is this woman relevant? Her 24 slams are absolute nonsense in the context of today's tennis world. It comes with a big asterisk.

The media LOVE talking about 24 slams without ever mentioning where and when these slams were won."
51,2020-02-02 11:10:07,exe5ro,"Margaret Court, the woman that wanted segregation in tennis, thinks Serena isn‚Äôt the GOAT. Shocking!

I‚Äôve decided to change my opinion based on this groundbreaking insight."
52,2020-02-02 12:50:44,exe5ro,Serena is still playing. Obviously she is saying this because she hates the idea that a black person might be the best.
53,2020-02-01 23:39:10,exe5ro,Another thing Margaret is wrong about.
54,2020-02-02 02:59:06,exe5ro,"She might be right. It doesn't matter.
Different eras, short overlap. Different rivals, different circuit.
It is a bit disreptecful to say it that way. She could say she admires more Graf style and say some reason. This way she's sounds like another annoyng Stan."
55,2020-02-02 04:56:28,exe5ro,"Surprise surprise. Both are more respectable and were/are much better players than her, that's for sure."
56,2020-02-02 02:32:44,exe5ro,I have a feeling Margaret Court only says this because Steffi Graf is married to a man.
57,2020-02-02 00:19:49,exe5ro,That‚Äôs....nonsense

60,2020-02-02 02:00:54,exe5ro,"Wow, how has Serena won so few titles compared to her grand slam record? Does she go missing the rest of the year?"

62,2020-02-02 01:41:08,exe5ro,Graf has the weakest era. Her only real rival was stabbed.

64,2020-02-02 04:15:05,exe5ro,Lots of tennis care about the GOAT debate

Still 24 Grand Slam wins is a HUGE achievement."
70,2020-07-23 01:25:00,exe5ro,This is what I‚Äôve been saying man lol. It‚Äôs like the Babe Ruth debate to me.
71,2020-02-02 04:06:05,exe5ro,umm..so is Serena?
72,2020-02-02 02:24:16,exe5ro,"She had some major injuries, a life scare, death of a sister, a child, etc, and she always focused on the slams, but in retrospect it contributed to her longevity. I've watched her since she first came out on tour and never in a million years did I think she'd play past 30. She proved me wrong and then some."
73,2020-02-02 01:56:10,exe5ro,"Exactly, Sabatini and Sanchez Vacario were never much of a threat and Seles was never the same and was dominating Graf in the period of the stabbing. By the time threats emerged, like Hingis, Davenport, and the William sisters, she ran out the door... though that French Open win when Hingis mentally collapsed was impressive. 

Also, how many doubles grand slams did Serena win?"
74,2020-02-02 02:21:48,exe5ro,"Graf's career did overlap with other greats both past and future, though.

Plus like OP said, then you must bring up Navratilova and Evert as GOAT contenders and you can make good claims every which way."
75,2020-02-02 03:22:34,exe5ro,"Prior to the stabbing record, Graf had a winning record of 6-4 against Seles"
76,2020-02-02 02:52:23,exe5ro,"Graf was better than Seles everywhere except Clay 

Hard Courts : Graf 3-2 

Grass : Graf 2-0 

Clay : Graf 3-3

Carpet : Graf 2-0 

Grand Slam Matches : Graf 6-4 

Year End Championship Matches : Graf 1-0

84,2020-02-02 02:56:24,exe5ro,"Haha the queen of having to ‚Äúbattle‚Äù a weak era is Williams, most of her slams came in an age where most tennis players are retired, after 30, she did have a more strong competition in her 20‚Äôs you CANT deny the last 10 years in female tennis were the weakest ever,  Weakest era EVER. This is why Serena kept playing, she knew."

93,2020-02-02 05:17:47,exe5ro,"Not sure why you're downvoted as this is true. Its a very weak mental era as well. So many WTA players can't hold leads in matches, it feels like whoever can string a few points together whilst in the lead will win. Also, players can't handle being a high ranking. Its literally a battle over who can fail their way to the top."
94,2020-02-02 06:13:54,exe5ro,"There have been 82 Grand Slams since the 1999 US Open. Serena has won 23 while the next best was Venus and Henin with 7 each. 

Not really a competitive era IMO."
95,2020-02-02 06:09:50,exe5ro,"Sele≈° was a great player but NOBODY knows how their rivalry would have turned out. It is ridiculous to assume Sele≈° would have dominated Graf. 


Comparing Graf to Tsonga is absolutely moronic. Tsonga is a nobody while Graf is a GOAT contender."

What Court said is that despite all that, Navratilova shouldn't be an idol for children because she is gay, which is a disgusting take from another era."

But Italy is really a shining beacon in the world. What, with the woman's employment rate, the political corruption, and organized crime? Real modern country you live in there, must be real proud."
109,2020-02-01 14:48:19,ew6giv,"Congrats Muguruza! Your complete collapse is the perfect cherry on the shit sundae that was this AO. That said... congratulations Kenin on your gutsy, at times shocking, win. Even if it wasn't the greatest performance, you did what you needed to do. Can't say that about any of those ladies you beat to get there."

112,2020-01-30 01:46:39,evuktl,"The magic isn't in the accomplishments, it's in you! You are so much more than that. When I start to feel bad about myself, I focus on taking care of myself. Exercising regularly and taking time to spend by myself, preferably walking through nature, helps a lot. It helps me to remember that my life is also for me."
113,2020-01-30 12:08:24,evuktl,"Accomplishments can be so important. I had a really difficult experience in college, and I was feeling extremely down about it right up until the point where they started getting close to calling my name at graduation. It just hit me all of a sudden that *I have an education*, and nobody can take that away from me. I felt like so many things had been taken from me across the course of my life. But this was something no one could steal, or break, or dismiss. It was mine. 

Don't let anyone make you feel diminished. You have a treasure trove they can't raid. Your accomplishments belong to you, and no one else. Nobody gets to decide their worth - and your worth - except you."
114,2020-01-30 03:07:12,evuktl,"True, animals perceive beauty as well. I don't think it's that complex though. I think to find something beautiful is simply to experience its loveliness. I don't think real beauty can be influenced by the media. I think conventional attractiveness is, but that's constantly changing as well. Lust sometimes accompanies beauty but is in no way the same thing. Beauty is so much deeper than that, and it stems from within."
115,2020-01-30 02:10:34,evuktl,Yeah I‚Äôm still trying to learn how to care for myself properly.

134,2020-01-26 05:07:36,etxgl8,watching Gauff it's hard not to think of the future ... I think a lot of these players are beating her or trying to for the very last time ...
135,2020-01-26 05:26:40,etxgl8,"Interested to hear any additional thoughts on the Thiem backhand. He does still take a massive cut at the ball and it seems to limit him on faster surfaces, which is why I don't see him making it too far on grass. Granted, however, that Sampras didn't exactly have a wonderful backhand, but I still view Thiem as more like Wawrinka than Sampras."
136,2020-01-26 09:43:12,etxgl8,"Wawrinka continues to bamboozle, Stanimal bias still real and it's been 2 years of him delivering pre-gs winner Stan inconsistent shanking rather than even some mild slaughter

I think Stan is the weak link of this round and Fuscovits wins more matches against Fed than the more bulky swiss against Med

As I write this Fabio got dispatched by Sandgren which is the most obvious thing I completely fail to comprehend in my life"
137,2020-01-26 00:41:14,etxgl8,"Monfils looks very improved. Wins in 5. 

Wawrinka in 5 very close tie sets."
138,2020-01-26 16:53:34,etxgl8,"You‚Äôre making too much of a big deal of Nadal vs Kyrgios. Nadal is the heavy favorite based on form and grand slam pedigree. He is mentally one of the strongest players, and treats every match normally. Nick on the other hand is a tad too temperamental and will rely more on trying to get into Nadal‚Äôs head (hardly an easy thing to do). Nadal should get the job done in at most 4 sets."
139,2020-01-27 03:05:10,etxgl8,Monfils concentrating more on facial expressions and making sure we know he might be injured than on winning this match ... thiem is likely to get a withdrawal if he wins this second set
140,2020-01-26 03:49:30,etxgl8,"I see a lot of people expecting Wawrinka to push Medvedev ... I think he's been passed by, but that's why they play the games ... if Zverev beats Rublev you have to think there's some sort of huge stylistic/mental block there for Rublev as they've had wildly different levels in the past six months"
141,2020-01-26 03:52:15,etxgl8,I think Barty has made improvements since then and her time at the top has made her way more consistent ... Riske is dangerous when she's winning but at the same time this would be the win of her career and she's capable of some very poor errors ...
142,2020-01-26 03:56:00,etxgl8,Bertens winning the AO would be a beautiful thing and she seems to be at her best so far
143,2020-01-26 03:55:18,etxgl8,I'm gonna spend some time chatting with my friends in audio production and see if there are tools they use to cancel out vocals ... maybe there's an app ... i know a  number of professional sporting events where i just want the announcer to stop talking to me like i'm an idiot for ten fucking seconds and I end up muting it all and listening to lectures/music instead
144,2020-01-26 06:01:24,etxgl8,"i think thiem is one of the players putting in the most time practicing their shots, and fed's precision despite his reputation as an artist I believe to be largely a product of tons and tons of reps ... the progress is slow and i'm not sure whether its his or his camps choice, but he is gradually moving closer and closer ... i like his game for grass but i have a different opinion about grass than many people and think athletic ability/fluidity is equally as important as serving ... I agree about his big swing limiting him, but he is making progress on the faster surfaces (getting very very efficient with the slice backhand) and i think he is more than likely the next new #1 on tour ..."
145,2020-01-27 03:08:49,etxgl8,Sandgren could beat federer and still not get respect ... his play and movement look like a past his prime country club bro but he's an excellent player ... optics are a hindrance on the tour with all the unique styles
146,2020-01-26 03:53:19,etxgl8,A Monfils win would sink my battleship it'll be great to watch though because Thiem is unlikely to give up many errors

""i dont know"" is the most profitable thought you can have in life ... i always hope for highlight reel stuff though and i love watching a great sporting moment unfold live"

149,2020-01-26 09:15:42,etxgl8,"Please dont get my hopes up too much. There havent been all that many succesfull players from my country, it would be a dream to see her win one. I feel so proud when any dutch sportsperson wins something"
150,2020-01-26 04:46:32,etxgl8,"Irrelevant question, what kind of lectures do you listen to?"
151,2020-01-27 08:58:42,etxgl8,Fair enough. I tend to disagree with that as that would mean we should never make statistical predictions. Statistics is the field of probabilistic prediction based on the given data. Science involves the use of statistical and mathematical models and techniques to make predictions.
152,2020-01-27 03:07:04,etxgl8,Im interested to see how Muguruza fares ... im backing bertens

154,2020-01-27 09:21:20,etxgl8,"you should do whatever you wish to do ... you should not delude yourself into thinking that every single mathematical approach to sportsbetting has not already been tried ... the math is simple, and the only way to win is to actually understand the game well enough to know when an outcome is more certain than the odds given ... there are zero blanket strategies that will work over time ... this does not mean you cannot win, but it is a good place to start from if you want to"
155,2020-01-27 10:04:00,etxgl8,"this didnt age well, lol"
156,2020-01-27 09:25:53,etxgl8,"I didn‚Äôt delude myself into thinking anything. Based on grand slam pedigree, clutch mentality and success at this event, it‚Äôs only logical for Nadal to be called the favorite in this match. I have studied advanced applied mathematics and am aware of the methods used to make predictions. Anyhow, it‚Äôs fine if you think this match is 50-50."
157,2020-01-27 18:48:39,etxgl8,Not so much ... muguruza never dropped the pressure ... played a nice match
158,2020-01-27 09:38:48,etxgl8,Best of luck having mock arguments with statements i didnt make
159,2020-01-27 09:58:44,etxgl8,Sure. I am aware of your deep bias and have no regrets calling you out for that. Have a good day.
160,2020-01-27 21:21:06,etxgl8,"you frustated me, but i should have been more patient ... I think i'm being misinterpreted ... when I said I wouldn't back either player in this match, I didn't mean that it was a tossup ... I meant that at -500 I would not back Nadal, as Nadal's market (you'll understand this as a mathematician) is almost always inflated, and that at +400, I would not back Kyrgios, as the odds of him turning in the performance of a lifetime are hardly 1 in 4.  Nadal is always the favorite in this matchup, and Kyrgios' peak level and effort are impossible to predict, so I avoid it ... two of Nick's victories came on grass and Acapulco, with grass being Nadal's worst surface and Kyrgios being a relatively unsolved player on tour at that time, and Acapulco being such an absurdly fast court that a victory over Nadal by a server almost became an annual tradition at one point ... you don't need to march out how smart you are, I spoke out of turn making this into an argument ..."

Its worth keeping in mind that while obviously best known for being a tennis player, she did start acting in the early 2000s. It was mostly guest appearances and minor roles, but still she was an actor before ATLA.  


If there was a specific reason for how Serena came to be a fan of ATLA as it aired, whether it be a recommendation from a friend or just happened to find it flipping channels I haven't seen that story shared online."

Asian countries had SARS like 17 years ago. They took this seriously."
228,2020-03-22 02:31:50,fmltu7,2 things this virus taught me is 1. A lot of people can work from home. 2. there is a universal hate towards land lords. Land lords would have evicted people off their homes and apartments due to people couldn‚Äôt  work because of the virus. Luckily the government  got our backs stopping landlords to kick people out of their homes.

Don't be mad. Learn from this. They got you now but next time you need to prepare well in advance. You need to get a sense of when fuckery is in the air.


Some of y'all should be on lsa. The ladies warned this would happen and suggested we stock late jan, early February. I got my toilet paper then and a months worth of goods. (I had to go back out for a second months because there is a lot of fuckery going on and this will last longer than 14 days.)

Were you listening to these white folks out here? You can't do that as a black woman. Nothing was done for Katrina, Puerto rico, Houston besides what we did for ourselves. DO NOT follow their guidelines and messages, take care of yourself! The cdc, who etc are political organizations. They do not value our individual lives or poc lives as a whole. Let dumb whites follow what they say but as a black woman you need to see through their lies and bullshit going forward for the rest of your life.

He was instrumental to those stretches of dominance Serena had in the 2010‚Äôs. She played more because of him and that  helped her maintain her level. On top of that her clay game went from being slightly above average to top tier. Serena hadn‚Äôt made a SF at RG since 03. She won 2 RG titles in there first 3 years together. His ability to improve clay results alone would make him a great option for Osaka because her clay results are average at best. 

I‚Äôm not a fan of the guy but Coco and Osaka would definitely benefit from an accomplished coach like him."

If your not opposed to the toe shoes, they are exactly what you want. They are laced and have a Velcro strap to keep your feet secure."
254,2020-03-19 11:32:17,fl7cuh,"""Support"" is inherently non-minimalist. You don't need special shoes for tennis. Your feet are (mostly) made to do the job. I personally like Merrell Vapor Gloves and Wildling Nebulas. I want to like Vivo but I think they tend to be overpriced for what they are. Most of the others you mention have too much unnecessary structure or are too narrow in the toe box. Shoes that are narrow in the toe box and don't allow for normal splay will cause you to change your whole hip alignment, slowing your game down, leaving you prone to injury. What is up with the stack height on the Reebox. Yikes! My feet hurt looking at them."

https://www.vivobarefoot.com/us/mens/everyday/geo-court-mens?colour=White%2fBlue%2fRed

I also think their Stealth could work, I find that slightly less roomy than the Stealth Otillo.  Personally I'd want less room in a court shoe.

My experience with Merrell is limited, I have one pair now just recently, to me they don't seem like they'd hold up well to a lot of court movement.  

If not Vivos, you may be able to find a regular court shoe with a removable arched foam insole - remove that, put in a slim insole with no support, and you may be good to go with just a bit more room like that."

259,2020-03-19 23:56:09,fl7cuh,"I don‚Äôt have either, although I planned on picking up the V2 later this week. I do however have a number of barefoot shoes including lems, viviobarefoot, soft star, and Vibrams and a number of minimal sandals and I‚Äôve been barefoot for 2 years. I have the V Runs right now and some older KSOs. They (Vibrams) all have more support than any of the shoes. The lems primal 2  might work as well, They don‚Äôt have a great grip, but they might be fine on a court and most resemble a court shoe. I wouldn‚Äôt do any of the trail or Mesa versions as the toe box is much smaller and doesn‚Äôt at all feel barefoot."
260,2020-03-19 12:00:51,fl7cuh,"Yes, I have a few pairs of Vapor Glove though none are 4s. I've used them for tennis, running, hiking, lifting. I don't often go truly barefoot away from my home or the woods/beach. Just personal preference."

I have more fat on my thighs and butt than Emma Watson but I‚Äôve seen many women with the combo triangle shaped body and low fat. 

I also feel like this line of thinking can be harmful. A younger insecure women might take this as ‚ÄúI have a more masculine square jaw, I‚Äôm 6ft, and I don‚Äôt have fat in all the ‚Äúright‚Äù places, maybe I wasn‚Äôt meant to be a women since I look this way‚Äù and that might cause self doubt and encourage them to transition."

I don‚Äôt agree with her on everything, that‚Äôs for sure.  I always take them with a grain of salt.  

I do like that she addresses ancestral differences in genetic expression of the traits.  

Edit: Unfortunately there aren‚Äôt many ‚Äòtransvestigators‚Äô left, and most of them weren‚Äôt very thorough to begin with. And NONE  address the notion that some of them could have been replaced at some point during their career,  honestly some of these celebrities might not even be the same person but that‚Äôs a whole other conversation.

There were some males I thought were definitely stretching to label FTM, but I actually agreed on Childish Gambino.  His torso is not ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù in my eye.  The curve in his back is a dead giveaway.  

I haven‚Äôt seen the Radcliffe or Jared P. video. 

And I‚Äôm not suggesting anything either way, but it worth noting that ‚Äúphalloplasty‚Äù is a thing.  

I hope it‚Äôs not that, most likely he‚Äôs a natural male and that would be great.  

> Also plastics and soy disrupt the endocrine system, so these people might be unknowingly undergoing hormone therapy.

I agree.  I believe that undiagnosed intersex conditions are much more common than we think."

Rather than risk their profits, and face legal ramifications for knowingly allowing this to happen, the trans movement was created. Sure there have always been gay people and trans people, but the numbers are exploding and there are powerful forces that are concerned the people will eventually catch on that they are being poisoned in the name of greed. The push to normalize it and criticize those who don‚Äôt buy into it, is a desperate attempt to keep the public from ever figuring out why these hormonal discrepancies are occurring more frequently."

I know women with a square jawline.  I‚Äôm a woman with broad shoulders.  Don‚Äôt hate yourself for having unique features.  I don‚Äôt mean to send a negative message toward women with features on one end of the spectrum.  Also these features are largely impacted by family lineage and race. 

You make a good point, but honestly one photo is all you need sometimes. 

Our ability to distinguish between male and female has been programmed out of us. 

Here‚Äôs a perfect example:
https://np.reddit.com/r/SwordOrSheath/comments/h9fmwq/sosh_title/

The skeleton is the proof.  It‚Äôs not just one trait, but a whole host of traits that work together.  We should be able to distinguish between male and female without relying on makeup or fashion.  But we‚Äôve lost that ability."
471,2020-07-10 21:17:48,g0n4tf,"I‚Äôm female.  With wide shoulders.  So I understand where you‚Äôre coming from.

If you see in the comments I said how there are no perfect ‚Äútransvestigators‚Äù and ultimately we have to use our own judgement/discernment. 

You have to take ALL of those traits that I listed into account.  Usually in her videos she addresses multiple aspects of the male/female skeleton. 

Take them with a grain of salt, but use your own discernment.  

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs likely that those videos would have a negative impact on self-image/encourage gender transition.

If anything, the women who take this topic seriously would find relief in the realization that many of these idols/models are biologically male, so they are not an true representation of the female form.  

Women can not achieve the same look that MTFs tend to promote‚Äî square jaws/ low bodyfat/ lean muscle/ ‚Äúfierce‚Äù look/ broad and square shoulders/ low hips/ straight legs (small Q angle)/ long necks/ long arms.   Of course there is always some variation and some women will naturally have traits on a spectrum which aligns somewhat with the opposite sex.

536,2020-04-12 19:23:21,g02joc,But not everybody can just learn bending because of contact with badger moles or studying the moon and all that. Those people still had to work for their bending by studying it over long periods of time in the first place and or have an emotional drive to want to learn it. Oma and Shu didn‚Äôt just stumble upon The Badger Moles and learn Earth-Bending out of the Blue they had an emotional drive to it because of a need for them to have Earthbending in order for there love to truly flourish.

538,2020-04-12 20:54:28,g02joc,"Yep. It also raises a bunch of other questions. Like, why do the children of benders often become benders? are the powers of the lion turtles inheritable? Does that also mean that the power given/taken away by the avatar is inherited? because that's clearly not the case. Yakon's power was taken by aang, but his children were benders. None of aang's children are energy benders, although he is. Is that pure coincidence?

Another big problem with the idea is that it removes the natural evolution and growth of bending, and removes the inherent spiritual nature of bending. If it was just given by the lion turtles, there is no inherent attachment of spirituality to bending. It is just a superpower like in DC or Marvel comics.

Everybody who has the Ability to bend is either going treat like a martial art that has to be refined or not do that but still use it to their advantage. There's also the fact that if everyone could learn bending all of the animals would be hunted down, and everyone in the Southern Water Tribe would be killed or captured due to the fact that a wave can teach you.

EDIT: there's also the fact that people would either be conscripted or volunteer to be in a conflict."
540,2020-04-13 01:59:59,g02joc,"> Like, why do the children of benders often become benders?

That's a question that has existed before Korra. Katara is one of the best waterbenders and yet none of her parents or grandparents are water benders. That fortuneteller episode features twins where only one of them is a earth bender. Bumi in Korra couldn't bend at first even though his father was the avatar and his mom was a waterbender. No one knows how genetics and bending works. 

> Yakon's power was taken by aang, but his children were benders.

Katara had no bender parents, and is a powerful waterbender. Doesn't really contradict anything. 

> None of aang's children are energy benders, although he is

I think only the avatar can learn energy bending. 

> Another big problem with the idea is that it removes the natural evolution and growth of bending

Not really. Those episodes made sure to show the difference between Wan fire bending and the others fire bending, even had one of the guys wan faced talk about how he was using the fire like an extension of himself. 

> there is no inherent attachment of spirituality to bending.

Haven't watched in a while, where was the attachment present in the original?"

Except we do. Bending is obviously a recessive trait. Blue eyed children often have brown eyed parents, right? Now, from the fact that there are twins with differing abilities, we can conclude that there are other factors at play here. Epigenetic, or metaphysical. Regardless, there is a genetic component as there is inheritance. 

And this is a problem. If energy bending can't alter genetic structure, all benders have to gain powers from turtles. If it can, Aang has removed the necessary alleles from Yakone who cannot pass it to his children. And this is just the world building problem with TLOK. We haven't discussed the narrative, or thematic issues with the series.

A lot of this is speculative as we dont know what energybending actually does to someone. But if it does affect them genetically that wouldnt be a contradiction with yakone. Yakone had mentioned their family were strong bloodbenders, very much possible the ability could have been from another relative or grandparent."

548,2020-04-13 18:40:14,g02joc,"that is entirely possible. But consider that lion turtles can give anyone the power to bend any element, all benders need to have an ancestor of that element, and that nobody has suddenly manifested the ability to bend late in their lives. This suggests more of a genetic route to me than epigenetic."
549,2020-04-14 08:23:01,g02joc,"I agree that it is speculative. To be honest, this is a minor problem that I see with the world building. It the problems with TLOK needs to be discussed, there are way more significant ones. This is not worth it.

That said, inheritance only works from parent to child. Let's say that all waterbenders have to have a gene X, and energy bending removes gene X from Yakone. He won't be able to pass it onto his children regardless of whether his relatives or grandparents. In practice, it is a bit more complicated than that, as there are different alleles of a gene coming from both parents, but the point still remains.

I have already explained why is it logical to assume that energy bending has a genetic component."

The creative work literally doesn't say anything to support your claims. And trying to pull a ""Death of the author"" just because you're wrong doesn't help either. 

> That is like the shit that JK Rowling has been pulling recently.

Except it isn't since this is a Q&A whereas the shit JKR does is releasing tweets giving extra facts when nobody was really asking. 

> Assuming that the work is grounded more or less in reality, it contradicts itself. If you can't see that, it's fine. No harm.

You saw a giant lion turtle that gave the Avatar mystical powers to defeat a man of pure evil and thought this series was grounded in reality? If you can't see how expecting biology to work properly in a series with magic elemental kung-fu fighters is being ridiculous, that's fine. No harm."
551,2020-04-13 19:34:59,g02joc,">Except it isn't since this is a Q&A whereas the shit JKR does is  releasing tweets giving extra facts when nobody was really asking.

How is that any different? Both instances are of authors giving out information about their work outside of the work itself. Whether others asked them to or not is irrelevant.

&#x200B;

>The creative work literally doesn't say anything to support your claims.

It isn't explicit doesn't mean that it doesn't exist. There are fantasy elements in a story doesn't mean that it's completely detached from reality and nothing in the reality works in the fantasy. This is the easy argument that everybody gives ""oh, look, there's this fantasy element in this story. So, nothing in it should bear any resemblance to reality. "". Unless there is obvious reasons shown to refute those claims, I will believe them. I mean, you take for a fact other than bending, physics works in the world. Why shouldn't biology?

You can take that easy argument. And we will just have to agree to disagree. That's fine, no harm."

Look at caitlyn jenner for an example of a typical man who transitioned in adulthood. That's what such a person would come across as. Obvious voice, obvious look, etc.

YES. When listening to the conference video that was a dead give away to my BS-meter. No subtle ""bass"" or anything, clearly female.

650,2020-05-01 14:17:45,gbieil,"That's not to say we can't actually train voice to sound like the opposite sex (training is easier for MtF than FtM, but FtM have natural voice drops on T and end up sounding like a ""squeak toy"" without training). My voice certainly sounds undeniably female despite having got that testosterone hit (being MtF but getting on hormones in adulthood).

Most transitioners, *especially* those who aren't exactly eager to be perfectionists, often slack in this area because it's *hard to do.* Bad training makes them end up whispering and having a sort of raspy voice. And no training just makes them obviously male sounding. If you see someone who looks like a regular woman, except maybe slightly masculine traits; *especially if they're an athlete* then it's probably just a regular woman.

The most obvious tells I've seen are voice as I mentioned, height (it's *rare* for mtf transitioners to be under say 5'5, and are often above 5'9), digit ratio (not super reliable but mtf transitioners who aren't TS often have a male digit ratio), frame (can't do anything about dem shoulders), possibly smaller breast size (hormones may not make them grow fully). And ofc behavior. For *actual* transsexuals as I noted we do have some weird physiology stuff, but for GID patients and medical transitioners without TS they end up having male builds in general.

For FTM they're easy to clock a lot of the time as they're often pretty short (under 5'6), very often have a ""squeak toy"" sound to their voice (this is due to rapid masculinization of voice without any training), and will be a ""small man"" on average. Don't bother looking for a lack of bulge because they get surgery and/or ""pack"" (fake dick prosthetic). Looking for breasts is pointless due to binding or surgery. This also goes for mtf, no point in looking for breast padding (we get actual boobs), or a ""bulge"". Bulges are handled through tucking (can't see it through clothes), surgery, padded clothing, and surgery.

If someone gets on hormone therapy prior to puberty you're basically fucked when it comes to clocking, and you'll just end up relying on behavioral cues. Which then comes down to how good of an actor they are, and whether they've got actual TS. FtMs who overplay it often come across like a chihuahua trying to pick a fight. MtFs overplaying it almost come across as a prostitute or stripper or something, perhaps like a bimbo.

But yeah, voice is usually what clocks people for me. It's so damn noticeable when you know what to look for. Transitioners can fix it, but many don't bother.

But yeah this transvestigation stuff is always so laughable because people don't understand what they're even supposed to be looking for, let alone how transition works."

Wow, thanks for a right up. So many cis people talking about this you rarely see someone who has actual experience with the details point this out.

655,2020-05-01 14:29:04,gbieil,"yeah, people are horribly informed on trans people and transitioning as a whole, *including people who claim to be experts.* It's a bit horrifying, and there *are* a lot of conspiracy stuff tied in with trans issues. But ""every celebrity is secretly trans"" ain't one of them.

Hell, transitioning *isn't even their goal.* They want to push androgyny, which is why they keep pushing this nonbinary stuff. Male and female combined into one. It's some weird occult stuff. It's also why when they do gender-bending stuff they always make it *really obvious.* Drag queens, super androgyny, obvious crossdressing, etc. They want to eradicate clear lines between men and women. Not keep them divided and just have men ""secretly as woman"". Whereas transsexuals like myself are often the reverse of that. I'm pretty feminine on average and think women *should* be feminine. But stuff like feminism pushes against that idea shitting on femininity and pushing women to be more masculine.

They've completely erased and appropriated transsexualism for their agenda of normalizing transvestism and androgyny. It's horrifying. Sex without reproduction, pure androgyny, breakdown of male and female, all in the name of ""supporting trans people"" when in reality they erase trans people, lie about the science behind it all, and then try to start claiming *everyone* is trans. It seems like the long-term goal here is a population reduction within certain countries/demographics; primarily pneumatic races; along with an influx of hylic races and pushing race mixing to distill and erase pneumatic races. Medical transitioners are completely infertile, so it benefits them to push transition onto people, even if it's not good for the person going through it (it's good for transsexuals, not entirely beneficial for GID, and harmful for the general public).

But that's a whole thing in itself. There is *so much* to talk about on this topic, but people just wanna boil it down to hating on ""trannies"" and trying to claim every famous person is trans. And it's just so depressing to watch it all."

692,2020-04-26 16:00:41,g8gfaw,"Nice writeup! I know you call them one hit wonder because they won only 1 Slam but a lot of these players arent one-hit wonders. This is why we should look beyond only Slam titles won and reward things like consistency as well. Roddick a 1 hit wonder doesnt sound quite right. Out of your list, these are the players I would consider 1 hit wonders:

Gaudio, Costa, Johannson, Korda, Gomez, Cash, Noah, Teacher, Edmondson

Cant predict Kenin, Barty, Andreescu's future now so I wont consider them.

Stephens, Ostapenko, Pennetta, Bartoli, Myskina, Majoni, Ruzici, Jau≈°ovic, Reid

In my opinion, 1 hit wonder is someone who just turned up for 1 event and didnt do much for the rest of their career. Players like Roddick, Delpo, Novotna would not be 1 hit wonders by my definition."

697,2020-04-27 01:11:15,g8gfaw,"She had a impressive 2019 so she wasn‚Äôt that out of left field, just overshadowed by the likes of Andreescu and Barty. Kenin won 3 titles in 2019 and had just played at the WTA finals a couple months prior (albeit as an alternate). 

Ostapenko‚Äôs French was a much bigger shock and even she made Wimbledon QF/SF the next two years, been ranked in the top 5, etc."
698,2020-04-26 19:04:14,g8gfaw,"I agree with this. Grand Slam titles were easy to use as a benchmark simply because of their prestige compared to other tournaments, it's unbiasedness, and how it limits the number of players on the list.

Turning up for 1 event would've been a great metric to use, however, there could've potentially been a lot of players to have made that list. Maybe limiting it to those that just made the quarterfinals or beyond would've helped a lot, I guess.

I guess if you count the runner-up trophy as significant, that would've trimmed down the list as well.

Believe me, I hated putting players like Roddick down. He, among many others on this list, deserve so much more credit than people give them. I only wish there was one agreed-upon standard to decide a person's success, but that's wishing for the world to be perfect as well."
699,2020-04-26 16:29:52,g8gfaw,"Agreed.  

Malivai Washington, the dude, who played the Wimbly Final against Krajicek -even though he lost- would be more of one-hit-wonder, in my book"
700,2020-04-27 02:56:10,g8gfaw,"I agree with this, but Cash as a one hit wonder? He wasn't that far off being a 3 time slam winner across 5 consecutive majors! (2 lost five-setters against Edberg and Wilander, one of them going 6-8.)

Similar performance to Ferrero with the difference being he was never as highly ranked (4 to 1) but performed better in the final matches."

704,2020-04-27 03:49:21,g8gfaw,My memory is a bit blurred of that era so I forgot about his finals. I rechecked his achievements and he did better in slams than in normal events. Didnt win too many titles either so for me he's still just around borderline. Could go either way

Henin‚Äôs is the most versatile women‚Äôs serve I have seen. She could hit with good power, nasty slice and - rarest of all on the WTA - big kick. The only player who has hit a better kicker than Henin is Stosur, and her serve had other limitations.

Henin‚Äôs serve definitely lacked consistency, and at times was a weakness because of that. But it was definitely my favourite."

&#x200B;

I think like a lot of people with our worldview I could give af about what celebrities believe and say, but I was genuinely surprised to see this post, and a little hopeful. Because whether we like it or not, these celebrities have wide reach and people do take them very seriously. Which is why they've become such a crucial propaganda tool for our rulers, and one that is obviously exploited to it's full potential.

&#x200B;

As totally messed up as it is, a post like this would actually be an incredibly bold stand to take, and I honestly expect that in this moment, if someone of her celebrity status posted exactly those words, it would probably become a controversy. There would be Kanye comparisons, she'd be compelled to apologize, and if she stood by her guns that could even have career ramifications for her.

&#x200B;

Maybe it seems like I'm exaggerating, but I challenge anybody to find a post of a non-political celebrity of her status expressing this sentiment in post-covid times.

&#x200B;

The whole idea of ""live and let live"" and specifically not attempting to use the coercive power of the state to beat the other half of the country into submission, to not see it as incumbent on political power to socially engineer the population through force - it's treated as extremism ffs (as usual, that's just projection; it's the mainstream idea about what it's justifiable for a government to do to an individual that has become extreme). It's exactly the kind of idea that would bring people together, and dis-empower the most insidious of our rulers, and that's exactly why I think propagandists work extra hard to stomp it out wherever they can. For someone who's admired as much as Serena Williams is to say something like that - definitely wouldn't fly. Their whole bizarro and relativist narrative on morality is so fragile and irrational that it only really works if there's a zero tolerance approach to dissent, or as close to zero tolerance as they can get. Anybody who breaks from that hegemony needs to be someone that can be dismissed as a racist, fringe, unhinged, selfish or motivated by some nefarious bad actor (Russians, Chinese, whatever). Attempting to do this to somebody like Serena Williams would almost certainly redpill some of her fans. 

&#x200B;

All this to say, I actually think it would be a pretty big deal for Serena Williams to say something like this. And it's not even like she's coming out as a libertarian or something crazy like that - but the propaganda is so tight and all encompassing these days that it would be treated as though she was."

Did they appoint their children to the white house, who have their own conflicts of interest?

That all changed after actually reading the Bible, Koran, Torah, Book of Mormon, and various other texts from other various faiths and ideologies, cover to cover multiple times, including study guides, as well. First I became agnostic, and later atheist, when I realized it was all bullshit. I‚Äôm not uneducated, quite the contrary. The more you dig into religion, not just Christianity , but damn near all of them, you realize that not only are the gods, all of them, immature assholes, you also realize that religion was simply an ancient way of controlling people, before governments became the primary form of control."

Whereas that's religious peoples MO, for instance the famous christian protests outside of the black mass in Oklahoma.

The evidence against Joe Biden and his son is overwhelming, there was no evidence of anything Trump was accused of, as far election manipulation, and when we give Ukraine so much aid and help them out at our cost in more ways than financial, and against our constitution too, the least they can do for us is to investigate the corrupt doings of our elite in their country, especially if it harms the USA, and those people want positions of power, and especially so considering their current president largely ran on an anti-corruption platform."
844,2020-06-23 21:47:01,heiiq8,When did ‚Äúany evidence‚Äù become ‚Äúactually proves‚Äù?
845,2020-06-23 23:01:53,heiiq8,"I fear  I dreamed  Capricorn  fell and made everyone everyone dumb

And lately, people are making it reality"
846,2020-06-23 23:13:17,heiiq8,"Trump asking for foreign nations to investigate political opponents is corrupt. Complete defiance of congressional oversight is also a terrible precedent.

What is your proof Obama spied on Trump? Or is that a fancy way of saying Trumps campaign crossed ethical lines and as a result was investigated?

Trump asking a foreign nation to investigate a U.S. citizen is itself corrupt. If the evidence of Bidens crime was clear Trumps DOJ would have acted on it. I guess you are okay with Trump delaying them aid despite congress holding the purse. Expand that executive power I guess.

Trump is corrupt in many ways. It is naive to downplay it."
847,2020-06-23 22:01:14,heiiq8,So you dont have proof then. Does the article even suggest Obama asked the FBI to go after political opponents? I am not even seeing any actual evidence for the specific claim. You could say the FBI crossed a line though even Trumps FBI seemed to think it was legal.
848,2020-06-23 23:38:17,heiiq8,"None of what mentioned on Trump‚Äôs part is corruption. Now all of a sudden foreign nations are the problem. Why is that corrupt? Those nations are where the crimes were commit, they have the jurisdiction and the ability to effectively investigate, and he‚Äôd have to work with them anyway. Also Ukraine owes it to us for all the aid we give them for no good reason. The FBI has a democrat bias as has been uncovered by Trump, and the DOJ is incompetent when it comes to corruption, not to mention all the Obama administration left overs that could derail the investigation, there were plenty of good reasons not to turn to them. Also in this case ‚Äúcongressional oversight‚Äù is just the actually corrupt Democrats protecting their nominee from accountability. There is overwhelming proof that Obama spied on Trump: https://theintercept.com/2019/12/12/the-inspector-generals-report-on-2016-fb-i-spying-reveals-a-scandal-of-historic-magnitude-not-only-for-the-fbi-but-also-the-u-s-media/ 
And: https://www.dailywire.com/news/12-pieces-proof-msm-knew-obama-spied-trump-and-john-nolte 
Furthermore you an absolute hypocrite for believing the accusations against Trump without evidence, but demanding it for Obama. And no Trump‚Äôs campaign didn‚Äôt violate any ethics, but Obama, a democrat who wanted Hillary Clinton and not Trump to be president absolutely did  spying on his campaign. Also despite that massive conflict of interest you give Obama the benefit of doubt but not Trump? Absolutely hypocritical and a double standard. And in what world do we live in, in which campaigns are spied on for ethical violations? Thats not how that has ever been handled, that is what you do when you want to manipulate an election, and this is all ignoring Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaigns ethical violations."
849,2020-06-23 22:07:30,heiiq8,"The FBI is an agency who reports to the president. Evidence of the FBI doing something is evidence of the president ordering it. It‚Äôs not proof, but it is evidence. 

For example if ICE were to capture and jail underaged individuals suspected of illegal immigration, that would be evidence of Trump ordering ICE to jail underaged individuals. 

For there to be ‚Äúproof‚Äù that Obama himself ordered it, we would need to see a memo or have an agent testify that the order was given. That is the difference between evidence and proof."
850,2020-06-23 23:52:59,heiiq8,"It seems insincere to call it a foreign nations problem when the U.S. president asks a foreign nation to investigate a U.S. citizen. It is worse because it was for a crime Trump cannot name and his own DOJ did think meritted investigation.

So your stance is that the president should ignore oversight if he feels like a victim of checks and balances. Seems like a bad precedent.

Please quote the specific proof that Obama spied on Trump. Like him ordering it, targeting a political opponent like Trump has done.

Trump admitted he asked them to investigate a political opponent. He defied oversight. It is not even disputed.

I wonder if whining about Hillary will change the consequences of normalizing Trumps corruptions."
851,2020-06-23 23:00:56,heiiq8,So you dont have proof and the only evidence is an investigation into Russian election interference that Trumps campaign stumbled into.
852,2020-06-24 00:25:23,heiiq8,"Umm not its not checks and balances when you are trying to protect a corrupt politician, and set an imaginary precedent no one had ever followed, also he could name a crime, and his DOJ didn‚Äôt think there was merit because the crimes occurred in foreign countries! And I‚Äôm sorry but when has it been unacceptable for a president to ask a foreign nation to investigate a US citizen, once again an imaginary rule crated put of nowhere. And no its not insincere since we give Ukraine aid, and the corruption happened in those countries, and involved their citizens, so damn right this is their problem too. Again Trump didn‚Äôt investigate a political opponent, he investigated a corrupt politician, Obama did spy on his however, and I already sent you the articles its your job to read them, I‚Äôm not going to do your reading comprehension for you. The fact that you didn‚Äôt even read the articles but believe baseless accusations about Trump speaks volumes about your double standards and hypocrisy. And I‚Äôm not whining about Hillary Clinton, I was pointing out Obama‚Äôs and your hypocrisy. I wonder if throwing insults in lieu of arguments makes you feel better though."
853,2020-06-23 23:05:29,heiiq8,"There is ‚Äúany evidence‚Äù, which is what you asked for. I pulled up an article from a left publication so that it couldn‚Äôt be dismissed as partisan. 

The evidence shows that the FBI, while under President Obama and AG Holder abused their investigatory powers to spy on an American who happened to work for the Trump team in transition.

I agree that it is not proof, and I wouldn‚Äôt join others who say that (Obama did so and so), but there is some evidence to suggest that happened, which is why I responded to your request for ‚Äúany evidence‚Äù."
854,2020-06-24 00:57:56,heiiq8,"Oversight of the executive is the job of Congress. That power is not limited based upon whatever opinion you have about it's use. Defiance for political reasons sets terrible precedent.

So the DOJ doesnt investigate American citizens for crimes overseas? Is it a Ukrainian law that Trump referenced?

Your articles do not actually even come close to proving that Obama spied on Trump. Sorry man."
855,2020-06-24 01:03:17,heiiq8,"Its not an opinion that they were protecting a corrupt politician, and created a power out of nowhere. You clearly didn‚Äôt read the articles then. Even the DOJ you love so much finds the accusations credible. And you‚Äôre being a hypocrite once again, something you have yet to address, you asked me for evidence and I provided you with solid evidence, you didn‚Äôt tell me to prove it like its a court of law, shifting goalposts. Yet you automatically believe Trump is guilty without any evidence, let alone that its all been more than debunked. And yes the DOJ can do that, but there are many other reasons he didn‚Äôt turn to them other than that, reasons you are ignoring. And its not Trump‚Äôs job to know Ukrainian law."
856,2020-06-24 02:11:43,heiiq8,"What was the specific law Biden broke? Oversight is not a new power but fundamental to checks and balances. Sorry man, Trump asking them to investigate a political opponent and defiance of oversight are actually known and not disputed. Trump is corrupt in many ways, in plain sight. So Trump wanted Biden investigated for a crime he doesnt know."
857,2020-06-24 02:25:26,heiiq8,"The oversight they sought isn‚Äôt a check or balance, and the president has the power to do the same, and thats what is doing by investigating a corrupt politician congress was trying to protectand don‚Äôt come here asking double standard questions because you can‚Äôt name a single law Trump broke. Trump does know the crime, again Trump is investigating a corrupt politician, not a political rival, you can‚Äôt run for office from behind bars. And you have yet to address your hypocrisy."
858,2020-06-24 02:33:30,heiiq8,"The oversight is the check and balance, if the executive can ignore them there is none. I am not claiming Trump broke the law, though the GAO report and the Judiciary Committee report make great arguments he did. I am pointing out that Trump is corrupt and soliciting election interference then blanket defiance of congressional oversight merits removal from office, unless you prefer a King."
859,2020-06-24 02:42:21,heiiq8,"You were this whole time saying Trump was corrupt implying he broke a law which he has to, to be impeached. And again he was not seeking election interference, as there was no way of knowing Biden was going to run for president at the time, he was a corrupt politician, all the investigation would have done is change who the democratic nominee is. And there is no constitutionally established oversight for such an investigation."
860,2020-06-24 02:48:08,heiiq8,"Well impeachment does not require a crime. For instance the president could just be grossly negligent, avoid his duties, and merit removal from office. In this case he asked a foreign nation to investigate Biden who was running for office at the time. He then completely defied congressional oversight. If he can ignore it for any reason at all, even if you like the reason, then checks and balances does not exist. Which is bad, unless you prefer a King."
861,2020-06-24 02:51:02,heiiq8,"Ok here we go again: 1. Biden was not running for office at the time, however that would only be even more reason to investigate further. 
2. Theres nothing illegal or wrong about getting foreign countries involved
3. Congress does not have the power to control investigations the executive branch launches."
862,2020-06-24 02:58:44,heiiq8,"Biden was actually running for office at the time. I guess you are okay with the president suggesting foreign nations investigate you based on laws he does not know and that were not created by your government. Congress does not control the executive branches investigations, but it can launch it's own in it's duty of oversight. The executive completely defying their requests for cooperation is a defiance of checks and balances. If they cannot investigate the president, and you are okay with that, you may prefer a King."
863,2020-06-24 03:02:02,heiiq8,"Its not his job to know their laws, Ukraine owes it to us, and congress can launch its own investigation, bit it trying to control Trump‚Äôs investigation. The executive does not have to cooperate, especially when the corrupt ‚Äúinvestigation‚Äù being launched by congress is a ruse to cover for Joe Biden. I never said they can‚Äôt investigate the president, you are now putting words in my mouth. And again if Biden was running at the time, even more reason to make sure he‚Äôs investigated."
864,2020-06-24 03:09:46,heiiq8,"So it is okay for Trump to ask a foreign nation to investigate a U.S. citizen, targeted because they are a political opponent, for something he does not know or understand if it is illegal while pressuring them with funding he illegally delayed that was legally allocated by congress. Weird mindset I guess.

The executive choosing to totally not cooperate with congress is a rejection of checks and balances. The voters put Trump into power and a House to check him. You can say you dislike their motive but they have the duty of oversight and they have power or they do not. If they cannot seek information, if the executive can totally refuse cooperation, they cannot investigate. And even worse is Trump arguing that he has total immunity in the courts. It is bad faith circular logic that removes checks and balances. If you do not think the executive should be subject to oversight you may prefer a king."
865,2020-06-24 03:23:04,heiiq8,"Yes it is to ask a foreign nation. And no he was targeted because he‚Äôs corrupt. He full well knew what it was he was after. He didn‚Äôt delay any funding, this has been so thoroughly disproven that it proves you just fall for any baseless accusation against Trump. But he should delay the funding, because Ukraine doesn‚Äôt deserve it, especially if they can‚Äôt fulfill this simple request, and foreign aid is unconstitutional anyway. He is by law allowed to deley foreign aid as well, its a power congress has given him. I already agreed to the powers the house has, but Trump wasn‚Äôt required to cooperate, and they were trying to interfere with an executive investigation. And its not a motive, their investigation was a coverup, so yes please blame me for not liking their ‚Äúmotive‚Äù."
866,2020-06-24 03:24:55,heiiq8,So Trump thought Biden was corrupt and merited investigation for a crime he did not know. That does not make sense. Trump did delay funding. It was illegal. Though that sort of doesn't matter since the DOJ says he cannot be indicted and his lawyers argue total immunity in the courts. Trump was required to cooperate or else he can ignore oversight going forward. That is the terrible precedent you excuse.
867,2020-06-24 03:39:40,heiiq8,"Trump did know what crimes Biden had commit. Furthermore if there is suspicion that something unlawful had been done you do not need to know the exact crime to merit an investigation. It is not illegal to withhold finding that is unconstitutional in the first place, and that congress have given the president the power to do by law. Once again he was not required by the constitution or the law to cooperate one bit."
868,2020-06-24 03:47:57,heiiq8,"Okay, so Trump think's Biden may have committed Ukrainian crimes of which he knows nothing. Ukraine would not care about our constitution. If the funding is unconstitutional and it is under Trump's control to give it, then aren't you saying he is the one violating the constitution? I guess you do not care about checks and balances. Literally, how do you hold the executive accountable for anything if they can ignore oversight?"
869,2020-06-24 03:57:06,heiiq8,"No he commit both American and Ukrainian crimes, that he knows everything about. I don‚Äôt care what Ukraine thinks that funding violates our constitution there is no obligation to Ukraine which has obligations to us. Don‚Äôt tell me about checks and balances when it is congress who had given the president that power by law, and yes the president is violating the constitution if he allows them to have a single cent of that money. And once again I acknowledge all powers of congress to launch their own investigation, but they cannot interfere in an executive investigation which is what they were trying to do."
870,2020-06-24 04:00:38,heiiq8,"So what are the American crimes? The president delaying that funding is illegal according to the GAO report and the Judiciary committee report. So you are admitting Trump is in fact corrupt and violating the constitution. Nah, asking for cooperation with oversight was not interfering and they did not even have an official investigation, Trump's DOJ did not think it had merit."
871,2020-06-24 04:17:10,heiiq8,"The judiciary committee is part of the anti-Trump congress so no credibility there. And the GOA is ignoring the fact that its unconstitutional to begin with. So no he is in compliance with the constitution. They were interfering, not merely asking for cooperation in a cover up, and yes Trump‚Äôs DOJ didn‚Äôt think they had merit for crimes that occurred in other countries thats why Trump asked them to investigate. If withholding of the funding was unconstitutional then that would have been part of the impeachment and he would have been convicted. The accusations in Ukraine are that Joe Biden wanted a Ukrainian prosecutor fired for the sole purpose of protecting his son, who with the full knowledge of his dad got a seat on a Ukrainian energy company called Burisma which he had no qualifications to be on, as a part of a corrupt deal with the former incredibly corrupt government of Ukraine, who the oligarch that owns and runs the company was very close with. All of this violates a number of American laws including but not limited to, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act."
872,2020-06-24 04:50:11,heiiq8,"So you are saying that those who are anti-Trump should be ignored. Which means that if Trump has done something bad you have insulated yourself from it.

How could they be interfering if there was not an investigation?

The withholding of funding was part of the abuse of power, the judiciary committee report backs the articles of impeachment. The GOP ignoring corruption does not erase it or it's consequences. 

Joe Biden did not have the power to withhold funding, did not actually even delay funding, and threatening them to fire a corrupt prosecutor was in line with the U.S. government and the international community. Trump's DOJ did not think it merited investigation, the illegality seems unlikely. Worse case here I see is  nepotism by a foreign business, which seems laughable considering Trump's ongoing nepotism and conflicts of interest with our government."
873,2020-06-24 05:19:48,heiiq8,"You are twisting my words into something they are not. Yes those who out in a corrupt which hunt should not be listened too. Its not the GOP who upheld corruption they stopped it, its the Democrats who uphold corruption. And the fact that you think its the GOP and not the democrats that only further exposes your double standards and hypocrisy, again which you have yet to address. Again the judiciary committee is out for Trump they have no credibility, and its not an abuse of power when: 1. It is a lawful power of the president. 2. Ukraine has obligations to us, and 3. It is unconstitutional in the first place. Trump hasn‚Äôt dome any nepotism or anything corrupt, and what Biden did was much worse all of Trump‚Äôs action were lawful and justified. Again Trump‚Äôs DOJ did not want to investigate crimes in other countries before they did their own thorough investigations, and there is no evidence to suggest that Ukrainian prosecutor was fired for being in line with the US government, yet another baseless lie you believe hypocritically, that prosecutor was hinted down for going after the Biden‚Äôs by the same corrupt regime that put them in that position. And why was Joe Biden involved in it anyway? He was involved because the prosecutor was going to expose him for who he really was. Also I don‚Äôt see what he has to do with the funding, I never put those two together, and I really hope that he doesn‚Äôt ever have that power because that would mean he‚Äôs the president."
874,2020-06-24 13:31:54,heiiq8,So your stance is the president should be able to ignore oversight if he wants. Trump appointing his chidren to the white house is nepotism. You seem eager for a King.
875,2020-06-24 16:41:08,heiiq8,"Again putting words in my mouth and making assumptions. He put one family member in a rather unimportant position, and it looks as if he‚Äôs getting rid of him too, what Biden did is much worse."
876,2020-06-24 17:28:28,heiiq8,"Trump apppointed his daughter and son in law to the white house, they also have conflcits of interest and lied about foreign contacts. But sure whine about Biden insincerely I guess.

It is not putting words in your mouth considering you keep saying the president should be able to ignore oversight, a fundamental check and balance. Do not blame me for noticing. It seems like you would prefer a King."
877,2020-06-24 17:42:12,heiiq8,"No I said he should be able to ignore their witch-hunt, and no again, more lies as much as I too hate Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump did not lie about foreign contacts yet another myth that I bet you hypocritically believe without evidence, the conflict of interest was mostly a myth too, meanwhile Biden did actually do something and something that is much worse and cover it up. Being able to cover up for corrupt politicians is not a check and balance, going after congress for it is. Unlike me, you seem to want a king, but a democrat."
878,2020-06-24 17:46:22,heiiq8,"So you think Trump should be able to ignore congress and their power of oversight. That is what you are actually saying. I am not sure how you do not understand that. If Congress has a power that can just be ignored then they do not have that power and checks and balances ends.

Jared certainly lied about contacts and only got a security clearance because Trump overrode it. Ivanka, Jared and Trump all have conflicts of interest. Sorry man, it is in plain sight.

Sorry man, you are the one condoning election interference, blanket defiance of oversight, nepotism and conflicts of interest. You seem to be just begging for a King. You seem to be o  the wrong sub."
879,2020-06-24 18:31:39,heiiq8,"That is not what I am saying, that is your hypocritical lack of reading comprehension speaking. Congress was not practicing a constitutional or lawful power, and I‚Äôm sorry but there are no general constitutional powers of ‚Äúoversight‚Äù or ‚Äúchecks and balances‚Äù only specific powers, none of which congress is practicing. And I forgot to mention a few things about Kushner, you‚Äôre right he lied quite a lot‚Äî to Trump, and kept hidden conflicts of interest that would have kept Trump from appointing him to that position, so Trump is the one who is the victim of Kushner‚Äôs lying. Furthermore Kushner along with others now on Trump‚Äôs cabinet have privately, now and in the past confided how much they hate Trump. And there are many reasons to believe that Trump had his hands forced to appointed Kushner and those others in the first place. Not to mention the internal White House tension that it has lead to. And now Trump is going in hard on Kushner, and will probably fire him soon so what more do you want on that front? Trump is now in the process of firing a guy he didn‚Äôt want in the first place. What did he even do wrong in the first place by appointing people who hate him and lied to him to his cabinet? Thats not nepotism. And no the president himself doesn‚Äôt have conflicts of interest, Joe Biden did though, when he played a role in firing a brave prosecutor in a foreign country, and still does in his business ventures no one sees. Also, what evidence did you even see that lead you to believe this? None I bet, further exposing you as a hypocrite which you have yet to address. And I‚Äôm sorry but I don‚Äôt know what to say if you think theres something wrong about Trump making sure the country knows the truth about Joe Biden to make sure such a corrupt crook doesn‚Äôt become president. And once again it would not have been election interference since it only would give the democrats a stronger nominee, you must live in the Twilight Zone if you really think someone ruining their chances at reelection which is what Trump was doing, is election interference."
880,2020-06-24 18:39:35,heiiq8,"Congress has power of oversight, legally and as a part of checks and balances. If you think the president should be able to decide whether it is valid then you are saying the president can ignore oversight if he wants. The rest is just a desperate rant by you, the guy who apparently would prefer a King. Own it."
881,2020-06-24 18:57:41,heiiq8,"Um no, I‚Äôve said time and time again, congress has certain powers specifically defined in the constitution that they did not practice, inventing new ones. Also those facts aren‚Äôt a rant thats just your excuse for being proven wrong and not having anything to say, you‚Äôre projecting very well when you call me desperate. I don‚Äôt want a king so don‚Äôt put words in my mouth, and yes the president has the power to decide that he‚Äôs not going to participate in cover up."
882,2020-06-24 19:14:32,heiiq8,"They have oversight of the executive or else there is no check or balance. The president having executive priviledge is also not in the constitution. They are implied powers that have precedent and limit executive power and you seem to want it unlimited for Trump which has consequence after him. Sorry man, Trump appointed Jared, gave him security clearance after his lies, he is responsible for the corruption and blaming others is desperate. Does Trump magically bear no responsibility for anything? You want a president to ignore the other branches when he wants, so you essentialy want a king. Sorry man, you are a feudal fool. Whining will not change what you are."
883,2020-06-24 19:20:01,heiiq8,"The president acted within his powers congress did not. There is constitutional power of a cover up. No sorry implied powers did not play a role here, and I never brought up executive privilege. Um no I want Trump to have his constitutional powers which is what he exercised, and yes he did appoint Kushner who he never wanted to, who lied to him, and is now getting rid of. Yes I‚Äôve already said K agree with you that he shouldn‚Äôt have appointed Kushner but for reasons other than you. And again no, stop putting words in my mouth, I want all sides to abide by the constitution which Trump did, and congress did not. Also once again insults are not an argument, and unlike you, do not trigger me, I‚Äôm not sure who‚Äôs the one whining when your turning to insults and twisting words, and are following me on reddit harassing me, and also choose to keep a pointless argument going on that only the two of us see."
884,2020-06-24 19:35:02,heiiq8,"Nah, the president ignoring oversight is not a power, well it wasnt. Now it is because rubes like you supported it and the GOP senate condoned it. It will be very hard to limit the executive now due to precedent. Yay...

Jared lying to Trump over his contacts was a long time ago, Trump still appointed him and kept him in the white house after that. But somehow Trump bears no responsibility for years. You are insincere.

You are the one defending the presidents blanket defiance of oversight so you seem to prefer a king. If you feel insulted you are correct, your mindset is terrible. Reality exists. Ignoring it is not actually a counter."

894,2020-06-23 21:54:31,hdysxx,Elite transgender inversion
895,2020-06-22 21:26:20,hdysxx,"Look at the hip to shoulder ratio and the tiny hands on well known female to male Donald Trump.

That is why he is always trying to be macho instead of acting like a biological male.

Biological males are quietly secure in their masculinity.

Donny is obviously not."
896,2020-06-22 23:22:30,hdysxx,"As far as the general public knows, these types of surgeries have existed for decades. However, according to the theory, they have actually secretly existed for centuries. The so-called puppets of the ""New World Order"" that have been transitioned are said to be very well hidden in plain sight to the public.

\*\*\*

Let's pretend that, with the assumption that you are female based on your username, you and your hypothetical husband are connected to the elites said to satanically control the world. You give birth to a healthy baby XY-chromosome boy. Within, a few months at most, the elites pay you guys an outstanding sum of money to have the boy castrated by surgeons that also have a secret alliance with the elites. You do so, and feed the boy hormones so that he can be raised as a girl. The boy now has a fake female genital area.

Now that the boy has been castrated before he could consent to it, he cannot properly function in the world as a normal human male. Without his little friends intact, he will never be able to produce sperm. Additionally, he cannot properly function as a female either. Only genetically born, XX-chromosome females can give birth and have periods. This means the the boy won't be able to biologically pass down his legacy. He won't have children of his own. He will, from a biological sense, have nothing organically to live for.

Knowing that, you, your husband, and the elites team up together to create an artificial reality for the child to be brought up in so that he (""she"") can thrive. Following the instruction of the elites, you send your child to the right schools, have him meet the right people, and pull several strings to prepare the child to be used as a puppet of the ""New World Order."" Until the child finally becomes a useful puppet - that is to say, he makes it in Hollywood, the WTA/WNBA/etc., the White House, etc. - ""she"" actually believes that ""she"" is a woman.

Once the child ""makes it,"" ""she"" is finally told that she is actually a male. Does he feel betrayed? No. He will have somehow logistically been brought up to not care. Will he expose the secret? No. He, by now, is probably being paid to keep the secret. He keeps it, he gets paid; he lets the cat out of the bag, who knows what happens? Ritual sacrifice? Torture? Whatever happens, the secret won't get out in TV, since the elites control that. The elites control everything - the media, the education system, the CIA and FBI, the healthcare system, you name it. Everything the public knows is already fundamentally built on lies anyway. Many other conspiracy theories are used to help distract the public from this one. 

He will continue to propagate whatever lies he has been programmed to spew out. What else does he have to live for? He (""she"") will likely have a handler, be it a spouse or a business partner, to assist him in this endeavor. The handler will have been secretly trained from a young age by the elites for that position. Should the handler perform his duties, he gets paid. If he fails, he ""disappears.""

Indeed. According to the theory, those who have supposedly been ""transgendered"" as babies are trained from a very young age to behave like the sex they have transitioned to.

[Trump](https://youtu.be/7Z5juwvDUz0?t=6403)

Looking at the *primary* characteristics of the female skeleton first, Trump has an acute Q-angle that starts below the crotch area. This is consistently stated by the narrator throughout his videos to be possible only if an individual is a genetically born (XX) female. 

With that established, *secondary* characteristics, such as the hip-to-shoulder ratio and hands you mentioned, can be used to back up the primary trait (i.e. Q-angle). The narrator advises viewers to be wary of other transvestigators that are actually effectively double-agents in disguise. These assumed shills will point out only the secondary characteristics of a person, without examining the primary traits first, presumably muddying the waters of the entire transvestigation theory."

905,2020-06-22 03:16:17,hdhitq,"I agree with you. No way am I going to be ride or die for black men like that, but I do have a black boyfriend. I don‚Äôt mind black men that will date anyone and just so happens to end up with a non black woman. I do dislike black men that act they are above black women and will date any race EXCEPT them and will run black women‚Äôs good name through the mud."
906,2020-06-22 04:52:32,hdhitq,"It sounds like your mom makes exceptions to her tolerance of IR relationships based on how much the relationship benefits black women. A black man with a non-black woman does not benefit black women, so she does not support them. When it comes to black women in IR relationships, if she's not familiar with Reddit, I can see why she'd think Serena's husband is a nobody. By contrast, everyone knows who Prince Harry is. MM is also white-passing, so maybe her relationship is easier for your mom to accept because it doesn't really *look* interracial. Your mom seems pretty clear that she doesn't like these kinds of relationships."
907,2020-06-22 01:57:05,hdhitq,"It sounds generational. My brother and I both married ""outside the race"" and my mom said, ""When you were kids and we told you everybody was the same, we didn't actually mean it!"" I think it also hurts my parents' feelings that we chose people who don't look like them. 

The ""bring someone up"" nonsense is more old school respectability politics. Does your mom know how much money Serena's husband is worth? LOL. Of course, I think there is also status applied to white women by some Black men. It can make some Black women angry, but I've decided I don't want those low self-esteem men anyway. The blondes can have them. Bye."
908,2020-06-22 02:00:47,hdhitq,"My opinion is similar to yours.  Black love is ideal but real love is real love.  I just realized that I‚Äôm so sick of seeing black women being hated on that it actually makes me feel good to see one of us be loved and doted on.  For awhile I liked the AMBW (Asian Men Black Women) community.  Both Asian men and Black women are underrepresented and misrepresented in the media and overlooked by our counterparts.  It‚Äôs the SEVERE anti-blackness in Asian communities that made me slow down on that.  If anyone reading is looking for something different, there‚Äôs even an AMBW subreddit."
909,2020-06-22 09:50:25,hdhitq,"Personally I see where she‚Äôs coming from. But I think with your mother it‚Äôs more about how interracial relationships make her feel than the actual motivations of the black person involved. Meghan (who‚Äôs not really black to me on account of her not wanting to be identified as such) has always been with white men, but your mother doesn‚Äôt care about that bc it doesn‚Äôt hurt her pride. But when a black man only dates outside her race it does. Not because your mother is some super sensitive person but because she maybe subconsciously realize how white supremacy does play a part in the politics and trends of interracial relationships. 

I also think a whole lot of people date ‚Äúout‚Äù as a result of internalized racism, and I feel like black ppl either down play/reject its influence or act like it‚Äôs at the root of every single relationship, instead of just having an honest conversation about the role racism plays in relationships and dating."
910,2020-06-22 00:36:44,hdhitq,"I‚Äôm happy for Serena and idrc about the royal family. I just find it weird to date white people in general. I don‚Äôt mind interracial dating between non white races but being with white people seems weird. As for your mothers irritation I think it comes more from the black men who degrade black women when they decide to date outside their race. You don‚Äôt see as many black women going out of their way diminish black men when they have white partners but black men seem to love to ‚Äúcrack jokes‚Äù at us when they get a non Black woman. Also for the reasons they don‚Äôt want black women, for example men like kodak black saying hE doNt WanNa BlAck woMan cuZ hE DonT neEd HiS KidS tO bE bLacK he GoT EnOuGh BlAck. That‚Äôs toxic in its own."
911,2020-06-22 05:22:58,hdhitq,"This is pretty on the nose!
Just today she was complaining how she can‚Äôt like John Legend bc he‚Äôs with Chrissy TeigenüôÑ.
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs so many black women without husbands bc of this.‚Äù 
Im exhausted.

I did try to explain how Serena‚Äôs husband is well-known and rich, but she can‚Äôt accept that either. I rly think it‚Äôs bc in her mind they look totally mismatched. ‚ÄúWhy would a queen like her get with HIM?‚Äù Even tho they‚Äôre both filthy rich.Yeah. 

All I tell her is I‚Äôm glad I don‚Äôt think like her lol."
912,2020-06-22 05:12:12,hdhitq,"I really do think it‚Äôs generational. I didn‚Äôt realize how bad the ‚Äúbringing up‚Äù was drilled into the past black ppl. We definitely have similar ideals of hypergamy floating in modern day society, but hearing her talk about how she was taught it felt so backwards lol.

I did explain that Serena‚Äôs man is probably richer than her.. but she just sees him as this nerdy meek thing, and she should‚Äôve had a black king. 
I was like Serena and her cute baby will be rich and fine lmao.

I do agree that there is a ‚Äúthing‚Äù that when black men achieve wealth, they steer to nb women as a sort of ‚Äústatus‚Äù now that they have the access and ‚Äúpick of the litter‚Äù so to speak."

From an outside perspective, the situation in the US is not that easy to grasp. I'm French and visiting Reddit everyday made me realize how divided the US can be and how heavy social pressure has become - to the point of cutting friends of family member if they think (or even act) differently.

I don't particularly like Rudy, and outside of the obvious mistake, my opinion of him has not gone down. There are sensible things written in that post that may be understood in a different way if you've been raised in the US because of the contexte there."

These kinds of posters are all over the place on reddit.

But are they going to say they dislike Trump for being anti-capitalistic and basically pushing elements of a command economy, which was basically accepted by people like Paul Ryan and Rand Paul?  No.  They'll say it about Bernie, the guy who's not actually in power.  But nary a peep about the actual President negotiating with individual companies, and the enormous opportunity for corruption that breeds.

There are some true independents out there.  But the vast majority are putting up a facade, in order to try and earn credibility to amplify their message."

1116,2020-06-21 07:52:51,hd13vy,"This is a lot like something that‚Äôs been going on with my mom. I remember after reading and watching so much political stuff I basically told her people can have different opinions on how to manage the economy or how to handle foreign affairs, that‚Äôs fine. But it comes to a point where it‚Äôs not about opinions. It‚Äôs about what‚Äôs a fact and what‚Äôs truth, wether scientific, or having to do with the law, or a moral truth. This was maybe before the impeachment inquiry started. Told her that politics right now weren‚Äôt about opinion vs opinion but truth vs falsehood, or if you wanted to really numb it down good vs bad. She told me I couldn‚Äôt think like that and that all peoples opinions mattered, that you needed a mix of both. Mind you she‚Äôs not a hateful person at all. I think it‚Äôs just how politics has been taught to us since we were small. Red vs blue and it has to be equal.

Anyways I didn‚Äôt stop sharing with her the stuff that would happen politically. Slowly she started agreeing with me on a lot of things, and I would hear her say stuff to me before I could tell her. She started reading articles for herself all the time and I‚Äôm happy. I feel like I did make a change. 

Anyways she‚Äôs been sharing with me how much she disagrees with her church on so much, they‚Äôve all become pretty much dedicated to trump and I can tell how much it bothers her. She just can‚Äôt connected being loving and acting like Jesus with being Trumps biggest supporters. She‚Äôs spoken out on it a lot to her church and either gotten ignored or talked back to.

It sucks, but I think we‚Äôve both gotten to the point ,especially now with Covid-19 and the strong BLM movement happening now, that at some point it‚Äôs about right vs wrong, truth vs falsehood, science and facts vs conspiracy. And certain topics you can‚Äôt have a ‚Äúdifferent opinion‚Äù because you‚Äôre going against what‚Äôs actually real or morally right"

I assume this is a mistake, because Trump is absolutely not an anti-capitalist lol"
1123,2020-06-21 17:08:55,hd13vy,"That certainly happens, but why do you think that's the cause? I can think of a couple more possibilities. First, you know what kind of bias Reddit has, both in direction and in magnitude. If you had equally strong criticisms for Republicans and Democrats, but you knew your audience already hated Republicans more than anything in the world...wouldn't your discussion naturally end up more about the latter, since on the former you'd just agree and move on?

Second, I think that left-leaning views are naturally suited for easier discussion. When people don't like Trump, or conservative thinkers, it tends to be for moral reasons. ""They're racist and I don't like racism. They're sexist and I don't like sexism."" Things that, if someone disagrees with you, you're not easily going to logic them out of it. But controversial left-leaning views are more like ""we should have a wealth tax, the president should discharge student loan debt, check out the Green New Deal."" Things that whether you like them or not, there's _tons_ to unpack.

I don't typically discuss politics online, because nobody cares what I think and that's fine. But on my own, when I encounter a conservative view that I disagree with, I say"" no"" and move on. When I see a progressive view that I disagree with, I can't help but lecture myself in my head about why it's wrong. And then I think you see that also play out for people who _do_ like arguing online."

1131,2020-06-21 21:22:52,hd13vy,"Okay sure but I don‚Äôt see Democrats electing a moron who muses over injecting bleach. Republicans have done much more damage to this country because they couldn‚Äôt rally behind someone smarter than a 4th grader.

This original posts is stupid. Look up the paradox of tolerance. If we are going to accept people no matter what their opinions are it‚Äôs leads to nothing but the oppressive and intolerant people thriving as no one will hold them accountable. 

Sure. Arguing about simple political topics like taxes can be simplified to just a difference of opinion. But when you are supporting a racist dude who has a history of it along with a sketchy history with women. That‚Äôs where it becomes more than just an opinion. 

I‚Äôm not a big fan of the Democrats either but there‚Äôs no way you can look at the homophobic, racist and sexist laws of the republicans and think to yourself. Hey man it‚Äôs okay it‚Äôs just a matter of opinions stop being toxic."

1. Her dad ran multiple times and the best he ever did was 17% of the vote in 2007. She doubled his percentage in 2016. There are many reasons for this, obviously. However a main reason is the rise of the acceptance of anti immigration rhetoric propelled by Frances right wing. 
2. France has a 70% voter turnout. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a pretty good representation of the country. 
3. I never said he did, only that it doesn‚Äôt surprise me that holds views like this due to the right wing shift in France."

1180,2020-06-21 07:42:54,hd13vy,"Not the person you asked, but imo cutting them off kind of ends up happening eventually anyways. When I was younger I would try and excuse behaviours and argue and show people the right path, but you can't change people if they don't want to change. It's not like they don't know racism/sexism/whatever is bad, it's just that they don't care or find justifications anyways. As I've gotten older, I've gotten tired of dealing with that BS, ended up drifting away from them and it feels way better. No regrets.

1183,2020-06-21 12:02:00,hd13vy,Depends on how you define capitalism. The capitalism that Trump is going for in his presidency doesn't have anything to do with the free market or competition.

She wraps it all up with ‚Äúif you can‚Äôt handle the fact that you may have a friend that has opposing views as you, then you are not any better than the bigots‚Äù. Which is so hilariously misguided.

B. Want to vote for Trump because you like his history of bigotry.

It'd be one thing if he was just some random employee, but anyone with a leadership role anywhere shouldn't have this kind of history. Much, much less the president of the United States. This is bigger than your life and life experiences, this is about the country. This isn't even a Democrat vs Republican issue.

Trump's brand is a corrupted version of economic nationalism, which in itself bastardizes socialist principles. He absolutely wants production maintained centrally, but only for the cronies he favors.

I'm not arguing socialism = bad. I'm arguing Trump's economic policies are mechanically closer to the thing he claims to hate than for any other president in the last 60 years, only he's pursuing it in a grotesque way to aid selective industries where his friends and advisory staff work.

I don't particularly agree with Hayek, but he had Trump pegged 80 years in advance. Trump loves central planning and social ownership if it benefits him, and he loves consolidating state power."
1286,2020-06-21 12:08:49,hd13vy,"Not necessarily. There is a way for capitalism to translate to a strong middle class and income mobility. All capitalism really means is that you can own property. You can start a business, run that business for a profit, and keep the profits for yourself. And guess what? You can still do that in Norway or Sweden or France or any other progressive European country. The reason we're in this mess right now where wages have been stagnant and income inequality is skyrocketing is because for the last 40 years our government has been dismantling the New Deal policies that led to the strongest economic period this country has ever seen."

Just for one minute stop playing the debate game and act like an honest adult who understands context, what view do you suppose she is telling me to respect?"
1291,2020-06-21 10:23:08,hd13vy,"You said ‚Äúit says respect people‚Äôs opinions‚Äù. If you say you don‚Äôt respect racist opinions you agree that there are limits and lines we can draw on respecting opinions. You agree that not all opinions are worthy of respect. 

You can‚Äôt honestly claim you don‚Äôt think any opinions are dumb. You just said they‚Äôre not all worthy of respect. If I tell you that Adam Silver is a better basketball player than Steph Curry you wouldn‚Äôt think that is dumb? You would. Yes, that‚Äôs an obvious example, but that‚Äôs the point, we can see some opinions are clearly dumb and not worthy of respect. No one who says this actually respects all opinions, it‚Äôs a talking point. There are always a ton of exceptions because that is how real life works. 

General statements like respect everyone‚Äôs opinion are dumb specifically because we can all agree there is stuff that does not deserve that respect.

What is this about arbitrating opinions, who gets to do that? I don‚Äôt understand the purpose of that comment? Can I arbitrate that racist opinions are dumb or wrong?

Regarding more of what the woman said, this idea that every bad thing is equal is nonsense. Someone dropping a friend because that friend has political beliefs they disagree isnt the same as someone thinking certain people aren‚Äôt equal to them, don‚Äôt deserve the same rights, etc. One of these things is very much potentially dangerous, directly or indirectly. It‚Äôs not the same as every case of someone cutting another person off. That‚Äôs a nothing issue by comparison. Even on a larger level, these people not wanting to listen to people who voted differently or feel differently about police violence aren‚Äôt nearly as bad racist. Maybe you find these people to be annoying, canceling this guy or that guy, but the consequences for the other thing are so much more damaging than having to go on an apology tour."

Let me tell you some other facts. Rudy is a French millionaire before being a French ""millennial"". He's also been living in the US for almost 10 years now. He's not representative of really any fraction of France's electorate. That's some kind of reach to go from Gobert being dumb to French presidential elections. Did they teach you to extrapolate like that in your political course? If I did the same, I could say that in fact he might be more influenced by his last decade living in the USA, a country that actually has voted into power its version of the populist anti-immigration candidate... France at least didn't.

I just don't fucking care. All you seem interested in is turning these anecdotal stories nobody cares about into big generalizations about whole populations. It's just pointless to me.

Blaming the whole for the sins of the few: I assume she is saying don't blame all police for the sins of the few police that murder or abuse their power. Obviously not all cops are bad, and while I do think there is corruption within departments its clearly true that most cops are not bad people.

Can't handle difference of opinion: just what it says views outside of the mainstream aren't allowed to be voiced in certain places. Facebook, youtube, and reddit censor many opinions that don't follow the mainstream.

For example, I hold the view that there isn't institutional racism in police departments. I think their is widespread corruption in departments, but it is linked closer to class than race. The corrupt police feel they can take advantage of people of low socioeconomic status, not blacks specifically. Kelly Thomas is a prime example.

That wasn't the point comment but ok.  There isn't a single metric you can use to completely define someone.  Everyone does good and bad things.  People will have their own criteria on how to evaluate someone and aggregate the sum of their actions to determine if they're good or bad.

You‚Äôre more interested in scoring imaginary internet points within your echo chamber than actually trying to understand why someone who is otherwise a decent person would support Trump.

Is the reason for some of those people that they‚Äôre abhorrent racists? Absolutely. But if you genuinely think that almost 50% of the voting population in this country are irredeemably racist people than I don‚Äôt think I can have a reasonable convo with you. The way to change minds is by reaching out to these people and having real conversations.

1342,2020-06-22 18:19:23,hd13vy,"I'm not treating them like children. I'm acknowledging that a big part of the system of systemic racism is divide and conquer, is [race wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy)... using media outlets like Fox News and other forms of propaganda to con poorer or less media savvy whites into believing that black people and immigrants are coming here to take advantage of our social safety net.

People are going around shouting about antiracism these days, but few seem to know what it means. Ibram Kendi, the author of ""how to be antiracist"", argues against the judgment of any group of people because cultures are a product of the *system*. *Judging* black people for the sociological trend of there being more violence in black communities or less prioritizing of education in his view is not just racist but incorrect, and judging white people for any sociological / demographic trend in their communities is similarly incorrect. Kendi's whole thesis, at least how I understood it, is that we should be focusing on prejudicial policies and activism of any kind that increases the chances of removing prejudicial policies... that racism is a function of power... that the moral judgment of any group of people for a sociological trend is not just a waste of resources in the fight for equality but also wrong.

So getting back to my point, I would propose that rather than telling white people supporting racist policies that they're morally corrupt, we should acknowledge that system corals and them into playing this role and work to help them see the light rather than what I see so frequently, which is this kind of circle jerk of dehumanizing hate... a continuation of Hillary's ""basket of deplorables"" comment. Using mob justice style shaming doesn't change people's ways of thinking. It simply entrenches them and frequently strengthens their resolve. If you want to be antiracist, then the goal should be to build a positive and inclusive platform that reaches to illustrate the commonalities we share rather than to ~~condemn~~ dismiss as irredeemable the ~~behavior of people~~ people whose ignorance is constructed by the same system that created and supports the prejudiced criminal justice system. The larger a coalition of antiracists we build, the better chance there is of a real and lasting shift towards equality.

People will have their own criteria on how to evaluate someone and aggregate the sum of their actions to determine if they're good or bad.

You're right, everyone does good and bad things. Hence why I base it off of decisions like who you think should having the single strongest position in the country. If you don't like rap music, ok that's cool. Not particularly fond of black comedy? That's cool too. Supporting a person with a history of racism, xenophobia, and chose a VP with a history of homophobia? Yeah, sorry, that's not ok. It's a bit bigger of an issue. There's a reason why the republican party is so divided right now. A lot of those fiscal conservatives started seeing the issues with Trump and now you have interparty war since many regret voting for Trump and only voted for him because he was republican. Not all Republicans are bad people and not all of them support Trump. You somehow think I'm trying to say that, but I'm not, I'm saying Trump supporters are bad. If your grandparents voted for Trump ok fine, maybe they were unaware, it happens. If they are still unaware you should fix that. If they are aware and don't care or agree with it, they are bad people.

>You do realize that while there are many conservative candidates, there is only one on the presidential ballot? So the choice when they voted for Trump wasn't Trump vs other conservatives. It was Trump vs someone whose fiscal policies were not in their best interests

>But you're blinded by emotions and pathological ideologies that your intellectual capacity has shrunk so drastically you cannot fathom that there are other reasons people vote Trump

Right, I'm blinded by emotions and pathological ideologies for thinking you shouldn't vote a person with a significant history of bigotry to become president when there are plenty of alternative candidates.

>You just resort to generalizing the other side. Grow up

I didn't generalize anything, it's a factual statement. You either support the bigotry or don't think the bigotry is a big enough of an issue to not vote for him. What is the alternative? If you supported Hitler you can't just shy from the bad things he did by saying 'I just wanted a strong economy' as if he wasn't a bad person.

A cancer is people like you who are so deep in your ideology that even when confronted with reality you still try to find a way to try and trick yourself into thinking you're the good guy.

I'll just add in regard to your previous comment about convincing white nationalists that many trump voters are angry about almost identical things to what BLM is angry about -- the prejudices the system has towards people without resources. Poor white people are killed by police and incarcerated at a much higher rate. Poor white people have the same issues of drug addiction, crappy schools, lack of opportunity for legal sources of income. Many these people would be highly amenable to the cause if we could rehumanize the left bc RW media tells them we don't care about poor people unless they're minorities.

Like, if you believe men are stronger and have more athletic ability than women, then all this story does is reaffirm that.  But it takes nothing away from the Williams sisters.   They are dominant in their sport, playing against people in fair competitions.  How does an unfair competition diminish that?

It would be like saying that top tier wheelchair basketball players are actually shit at basketball because Shaq could dunk on them.  Brock Lesnar would eat Connor McGregor for lunch. That doesn't make McGregor a bad fighter, they're in different weight classes.

It's just a way for men who haven't done anything worthwhile in their lives to feel a sense of superiority and pride because they totally definitely could beat any women at sports, they just haven't tried because it's so obvious that they'd succeed, but trust them, being a man means they would beat women at sports and that makes them better than world class athletes at the top of their field."
1449,2020-06-18 15:39:21,hbg662,"While I don‚Äôt doubt Karsten beat them, I‚Äôm sure a few parts of that story were exaggerated. 203rd and ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt train at all‚Äù? Hardly likely. I don‚Äôt doubt he was unhealthy compared to the average top 300 tennis player but details like that and him apparently ‚Äúplaying like a top 600‚Äù just don‚Äôt make much sense. Anyway I don‚Äôt get the point of the comparison because they‚Äôll never play each other in a real competitive match."

All of those quotes come from Braasch himself, mainly in [this article](https://www.theguardian.com/observer/osm/story/0,,543962,00.html) or articles tracing back to that one and all of those claims were made after the fact. Just reading through it, he comes off as a condescending asshole who said all that just to further denigrate the sisters. He clearly cared a lot about proving them wrong, so there's no way he treated the matches in such a cavalier way, especially considering it's about the most fame he's ever had."
1458,2020-06-19 10:44:04,hbg662,"It's really stupid either way, because this guy was a top player, so that shows that she IS able to beat almost all men in tennis, it shows that she has to go almost all the way to the best of the best before the physiological differences between men and women become insurmountable.  

It doesn't at all fit the narrative that men are naturally way better at sports, it shows that they have a tiny advantage at best, at least when it comes to sports where strength is not the biggest factor in deciding the winner."
1459,2020-06-20 17:04:13,hbg662,"And most of the purported backstory/context just comes from Karsten‚Äôs own personal testament, which, considering he‚Äôs a pedantic, rude, and probably sexist asshole from what I can gather, likely is mostly false."

Though I will say human sexual dimorphism is way more complicated and varied than just 'men are stronger and better at sports.'  Plus, individual variation is more important than sex differences.

> Mr. Huffman said users on ‚ÄúThe_Donald‚Äù had frequently violated its first updated rule: ‚ÄúRemember the human.‚Äù He said he and others at Reddit repeatedly attempted to reason with moderators of ‚ÄúThe_Donald,‚Äù who run the subreddit on a volunteer basis, to no avail. Banning the forum was a last-ditch effort to contain harassment, he said.

> ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve given them many opportunities to be successful,‚Äù Mr. Huffman said. ‚ÄúThe message is clear that they have no intention of working with us.‚Äù

Do I understand this correctly? They change the rules on a Monday and on that same Monday they delete T_D for violating those brand new rules?

By all means ban subs that break the rules. Why was T_D not deleted for rule violations earlier if it is the case they break reddit rules? If reddit rules were insufficient, by all means adjust them and insist on T_D following them from that point on.

But this kind of one-two punch tastes of injustice. If you get kicked out of a bar over a half full drink because someone just scribbled a rule on a chalkboard that says ""no entry with adidas shoes combined with poloshirts as of 11.19 p.m."" that's just a thinly veiled disguise of ""we don't like your kind in here, gtfo no refunds""."

1499,2020-06-29 21:31:59,hi4zrt,"I'm of the opinion that rules for things like hate speech should be a community level decision, not a platform level decision.  Lean towards free speech as a principle, and keeping the people who need to be contained in containment boards as a practicality."

1501,2020-06-29 21:49:07,hi4zrt,t\_d has apparently been dead for many months.  They've already moved on.  That's why we're not noticing the same hate flood that happened when fatpeoplehate was banned some years ago.
1502,2020-06-30 04:16:27,hi4zrt,"Like I said, progressive stack.  Trans outranks cis.  If gendercritical were devoted just to hating cisgender men, they'd be fine."
1503,2020-06-29 21:47:56,hi4zrt,"I'm not.  I have yet to come across any kind of quality discourse where hate speech has been necessary to express any sort of useful ideas.  Reddit has clearly been a breeding ground for turds of all political stripes, so it would be nice if whatever replaces it (a man can dream) could prevent those turds from taking root in the first place.

Edit:  Also, reddit is, in some senses, one big community.  It would be one thing if each subreddit required its own registration, but as it stands, anyone with a reddit account can seep out of a shithole and contaminate another sub."
1504,2020-06-30 01:58:28,hi4zrt,"Banning one sub isn't going to shut down the dirtbag left, particularly if the ""remember the human"" rule excludes some people from being human."

1511,2020-06-30 02:33:09,hi4zrt,"The problem as a whole is that Reddit has been pretty lax on stopping using the platform as a launching pad for various forms of activism. To me that seems to be one of the big concerns they're addressing here, although they're clumsy...or obscurant enough to not actually acknowledge it. 

That's my understanding of why CTH got the boot, is that the mods were doing nothing to stop/prevent brigading. The weird thing is that the CTH subreddit isn't even the commonly accepted community for that podcast...it's Stupididpol. 

And I have a distaste for that sort of internet activism, but way back when it was super common. Bloggers all over the political spectrum would direct their fanbases at things like online polls and message boards. The conventional wisdom for this really didn't change up until GamerGate, to be blunt. Probably a matter of whose ax was now being gored."
1512,2020-06-30 02:17:26,hi4zrt,"Oh OK, I get now that you're referring to the rule against hate speech not protecting people in majority groups. That wasn't mentioned in the post, so didn't realize that was part of this. And yeah, I agree that that is stupid."
1513,2020-06-30 02:24:42,hi4zrt,"Honestly, IMO the banning of t\_d was too little too late, since it essentially disbanded months ago and they've been breaking sitewide rules since 2015, and I have a sneaking suspicion that part of the reason they axed chapo was so they could seem even-handed (nevertheless, I won't miss it)."
1514,2020-06-30 02:43:12,hi4zrt,"They also banned GenderCritical, which was also a shithole leftist sub.

Two active subs vs one dead one seems to be pretty even handed to me."
1515,2020-06-30 04:18:23,hi4zrt,How many times does this guy have to say his argument has nothing to do with a measuring contest of how many subs on which side of the aisle got banned?

1530,2020-08-20 17:42:51,idc3kd,"Was just thinking this, lol. The Williams sisters said they could beat any man who ranked lower than the top 200 in men‚Äôs tennis. So they played a man ranked 203 and he mopped the floor with them."
1531,2020-08-20 17:19:58,idc3kd,"Well she has 23 grand slams and was named best female singles tennis player of all time by The Tennis Channel. I don't know much about tennis but still seems impressive to me.

Either way it's the sentiment that counts, girls and boys are both awesome"

1534,2020-08-20 17:56:00,idc3kd,Yeah i agree girls and boys are awesome. Just letting ya know.
1535,2020-08-20 17:13:54,idc3kd,That's amazing
1536,2020-08-19 22:42:40,icxmr2,"Dude from the way you make the book sound it's as if it's a classical Greek epic! What's the overarching theme/ message of the book? Like what's it's message? Just curious, it sounds like a very interesting read, I might pick it up!"
1537,2020-08-20 01:53:31,icxmr2,"thanks! I love being really enthusiastic about a thing I'm reading! Not quite an epic since it's an essay collection, but I kind of like it that way. I think since these were almost all written as standalone pieces at first, that's part of the reason each one packs a pretty big punch.

The essays are almost all about music, or sports and the themes touch on loss, racism, friendship, loyalty, growing up, and things like that. It really resonates with me when I feel connected to the music/idols I know, but I don't think pop culture knowledge is necessary to enjoy this book. I still really like the essays where I'm not familiar with the subject. Abdurraqib uses pop culture as a lens to deconstruct how we view the world. Who gets to take up space, who gets to be loud, and who doesn't.


I definitely recommend it if you're thinking of picking it up! 
Especially if you were into emo/punk/rap/underground music, and/or you are in your late 20s early 30s, and/or you grew up in the Midwest,
I will say I feel a sort of personal investment. The way I recognize a lot of these acts from my youth really draw me in. Like, I was at the same Minneapolis atmosphere show in Feb 2012, the night trayvon Martin died, that he writes about, it's so eerie how he captured that night. I experienced so much of the same Midwestern music scene that he did (I'm from Iowa), but from a totally different perspective. It's so wild to see that for all that was similar, so much was different. 

That's what I love about literature so much, you can see and experience so many different ways of life. It breeds empathy and understanding"

Just letting people that want to know, the girl this person is referencing (Naomi Osaka) still idolizes Serena, has publicly said she‚Äôs like a ‚ÄúMom‚Äù to her and hasn‚Äôt said anything negative about Serena. Also, Serena didn‚Äôt get upset at Osaka (she actually attempted to comfort her after the game). She acted out towards an umpire when she thought she got a false call (something many tennis players have done)."
1584,2020-08-17 14:13:59,ib5gvi,Yeah!! Honestly if Serena was white and the other was black shit would be national news. But Serena had his white savior husband to protect her.

>if that's the metric we're using

You brought it up first in this thread, why are you saying ""if"" as if it was mentioned above? But anyway, slams never should be the be-all end-all metric. They are most important events obviously but tennis season doesn't last 8 weeks, it lasts a lot longer."
1600,2020-08-17 18:49:44,ib5gvi,"I have to say, I‚Äôm quite surprised by the response to my question. Is it some secret that the top male tennis players are physically stronger than the top female players? I don‚Äôt follow tennis, so I legitimately thought that she perhaps had defeated the top male player. I‚Äôm all for unisex tennis matches, however. That would be interesting."
1601,2020-08-17 12:55:34,ib5gvi,"While I agree with what your getting at, your example is a bit flawed because nobody would question because they just assume he would win."

Players ranked over 200 and was thoroughly beaten. Testosterone is one hell of a performance enhancing drug."
1606,2020-08-17 14:07:56,ib5gvi,"""At the height of the Williams boom in 1998, an unofficial game took place in Australia after Serena and Venus claimed that no male player outside the top 200 could beat them.
Up stepped a German known as Karsten Braasch who was ranked 203rd in the world and after first beating Serena 6-1, he then disposed of Venus 6-2.
""I didn't know it would be that difficult. I played shots that would have been winners on the women's circuit and he got to them very easily,"" said Serena.""

1609,2020-08-17 20:45:41,ib5gvi,"Kinda what I was getting at, there is a reason people assume men are better at their respective sport. Doesn't mean that they should always assume that, but its not unreasonable to ask where they would rank on the men's circuit."

1613,2020-08-18 03:05:19,ib5gvi,"As I said, shouldn't always assume they are better. However, scoring points and winning is the goal, whoever can do that within the rules of the game is the better player. So until you have a women's team with better technical skills and better fundamentals square off against the men and see who wins you can't say who would be better."

I'm pretty sure there was footage from during covid of her lifting."
1621,2020-08-15 20:07:57,ia9rw5,She said she lifts every morning in her Masterclass
1622,2020-08-16 01:15:10,ia9rw5,"To me, she seems plenty strong; but she doesn‚Äôt seem fast or agile enough these days."
1623,2020-08-16 08:27:30,ia9rw5,"No. Gaining muscle mass would inhibit her movement. Y‚Äôall remember what happened to JJ? She went the weights route, lost about 2 steps in her movement, and never got them back. Serena does scout. She also makes a conscious choice not to hit every ball as hard as she can. She hasn‚Äôt played like that since PMou took over in 2012. If she reverted to her pre-2012 style I don‚Äôt think she could sustain it at this age."
1624,2020-08-15 19:20:49,ia9rw5,"I agree.  She used to outhit her opponents regularly, but now the WTA is very deep and plenty of girls have no reason to be intimidated by her.  I‚Äôm actually a little worried about SW.  She doesn‚Äôt look to be enjoying herself, it appears as though she doesn‚Äôt scout her opponents, and her groundstrokes break down when she has to run a lot.  I‚Äôd love to see her retire on a high note, but doubt she can win 7 straight matches at a GS."
1625,2020-08-15 17:33:15,ia9rw5,More indication during the US Open. She needs to avoid a fierce counter-attacker like Kerber in later stages.

1628,2020-08-15 20:29:55,ia9rw5,I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs heavy lifting like what most WTA PLAYERS are doing. Hence why they have caught up with her physically.
1629,2020-08-16 01:31:34,ia9rw5,Her feet seem stuck in mud these days. The Serena camp should change something because what they are doing is clearly not working.
1630,2020-08-16 10:56:25,ia9rw5,Strength gains and hypertrophy are two different training methods. Heavy lifting with low reps trains your nervous system to recruit more muscle units not make them bulky
1631,2020-08-15 20:21:17,ia9rw5,"Yeah. Mentally Serena is still a champion but physically the WTA field has caught up with her and surpassing her. Plus the younger generation   are stronger and more skilled. For her to finish with glory, she must start strength training, plenty of evidence that it improves performance. If Serena is physically on par with the WTA field l will always pick her to win but at the moment she is regressing in terms of her physical dominance."
1632,2020-08-15 22:29:57,ia9rw5,I can‚Äôt imagine she has the same desire she once had. At 39 the body is less willing to run down that extra ball. I think she should have retired after her last Australian open win
1633,2020-08-15 21:30:23,ia9rw5,"Oh, that makes sense"
1634,2020-08-16 02:12:42,ia9rw5,"She‚Äôs losing her advantage because a lot of the players hit harder these days, more so than in the past when she dominated. At the same time many of the players who are 10, 15, 20 years younger than her are a lot faster."

1648,2020-08-15 03:02:05,i9od1e,"nah, the future of tennis video games is definitely VR. tennis probably translates better than almost any other major sport to VR. the hitting in baseball would translate well but nothing else would. you could even set it up so the remote feels like a real racquet. 

imagine combining the technologies though. you'd be able to actually try to play against federer. the hiscores in a game like that would be so lit too, I wonder if any amateur could train enough to take a set off of a deep fake pro?"

He hit a ball aggressively towards the back of the court with intent.  

What Djokovic did was the equivalent of run a red light on purpose and then hit someone on accident. Doesn't matter he's guilty. What Serena did was the equivalent of road rage ( verbal only). Trying to equate the 2 is absolutely absurd and innate biases are clearly on display by you and others."
1687,2020-09-07 13:16:14,io6q4h,"Djokovic absolutely hit the ball intentionally. He didn't mean to hit the person.

It's analagous to running a red light and t boning and killing someone. You need to be careful with your wording when you say it was ""unintentional"""
1688,2020-09-07 13:18:51,io6q4h,"No that's not the same at all and you're lying with that analogy.

It's akin to getting angry shoving a player in football after the whistle and breaking the refs leg. It's similar to choosing to enage in reckless behavior and running a red light and killing a family. You still get charged with manslaughter. 

A linedrive hitting an umpire is part of the game and is a tragic accident. This absolutely was not an accident due to the game. Djokovic was clearly at fault and was engaging in reckless behavior.  this is also a pattern of behavior for him recently. He almost got dqed at RG 2016( the title he won ) as he threw his racket and barely missed a linesman"
1689,2020-09-07 13:20:35,io6q4h,"It doesn't matter if it was an accident, he was being reckless and caused someone harm, if he had hit someone accidentally in the course of actually playing a point then nothing would have happened."

If you break down FAA's game, ie. Serve forehands backhands, balance, movement...hes got everything. But tennis is so much more complicated than that..and that may be the explanation why he hasnt had a breakout success yet in either masters 1000 or grand slams. I do agree the ingredients are there though. So I dont really agree with the level of hype.

Random side note: i think Rublev has flown under the radar. I consider him and FAA as kind of playing a brand of tennis thats 'new age'."

> Another event dubbed a ""Battle of the Sexes"" took place during the 1998 Australian Open[56] between Karsten Braasch and the Williams sisters. Venus and Serena Williams had claimed that they could beat any male player ranked outside the world's top 200, so Braasch, then ranked 203rd, challenged them both. Braasch was described by one journalist as ""a man whose training regime centered around a pack of cigarettes and more than a couple of bottles of ice cold lager"".[57][56] The matches took place on court number 12 in Melbourne Park,[58] after Braasch had finished a round of golf and two shandies. He first took on Serena and after leading 5‚Äì0, beat her 6‚Äì1. Venus then walked on court and again Braasch was victorious, this time winning 6‚Äì2.[56] Braasch said afterwards, ""500 and above, no chance"". He added that he had played like someone ranked 600th in order to keep the game ""fun""[59] and that the big difference was that men can chase down shots much easier and put spin on the ball that female players can't handle. The Williams sisters adjusted their claim to beating men outside the top 350.

1738,2020-10-09 08:29:55,j7v908,you clearly don‚Äôt know much about tennis if you don‚Äôt understand open era versus the years before.
1739,2020-10-09 11:18:41,j7v908,The same reason Andy had a better career than Stan
1740,2020-10-09 11:37:52,j7v908,Because Margaret Court likes saying horrible things and this is her punishment.
1741,2020-10-09 10:49:26,j7v908,"For those sneering at how she ""only won a lot in Australia"", or ""only won in the '60s""...

She has 64 combined grand slam titles. If you subtract all her Aussie wins (23) she still has 41 left -- that's more than Billie Jean King or Serena, and almost as many as Graf and Evert put together.

She has a >80% winning record vs top 10-rated opponents, the best career- and grand slam match-winning percentages in the open era, as well as a CYGS in 1970. And for those who don't know, she retired in the late '60s -- the grand slam was during her comeback. She then retired a second time to have a child, before returning again to win three slams in one year in 1973.

She has a >90% win rate at three different slams; Graf managed that at one, Serena at none. She has as many consecutive slams won (6) as Graf or Navratilova. She has five ""triple crowns"" (singles, doubles, and mixed at the same slam) which is a shared record. And uniquely in all of tennis, she completed the career slam in singles, doubles, and mixed (the ""boxed set"") twice. Only two other women have done it once (Navratilova and Hart).

She's a batshit crazy homophobe for sure, but her numbers are absolutely stellar. The idea that she's not in the GOAT conversation at all is patently ludicrous."
1742,2020-10-09 08:45:56,j7v908,Same reason why Ken Rosewall with 23 majors isn‚Äôt called GOAT
1743,2020-10-09 09:37:13,j7v908,"Because Court is a homophobic cunt and she‚Äôs played Australian Opens when the competition was non existent. It ain‚Äôt rocket science. Also, Court isn‚Äôt a good representative for the sport."

1748,2020-10-09 10:01:41,j7v908,ok but that has nothing to do with her skill level and accomplishments...
1749,2020-10-09 14:33:46,j7v908,"So it's even a bigger argument AGAINST Court being the GOAT.

There were literal slams where she had to win FOUR matches to win her slam against purely Australians."

1753,2020-10-09 11:52:26,j7v908,"Exactly, and given what an utter POS Serena is, it's hardly a compelling argument. 24 singles slams, 64 slams in total, will never be beaten or even equalled. Obviously Margaret's god works :)"

1755,2020-10-09 08:53:01,j7v908,how does it matter anyway? it was around the same time...
1756,2020-10-09 14:35:25,j7v908,Imagine comparing the horrible things Court has said and stand by to the handful of incidents by Serena on the court.

Steffi Graf has four career slams plus a golden slam. Margaret Court has three career slams plus an actual slam. Why would you compare Serena to male players when there are female players who make a more logical comparison and actually have better records than her? It‚Äôs odd."
1763,2020-10-09 13:49:39,j7pnvu,Federer can get 5 time career grand slam if he wins 4 more french opens
1764,2020-10-09 04:21:35,j7pnvu,"The ‚Äúfor context‚Äù is not the right context. Men‚Äôs and womens tennis is not the same context at all. 

You should say for context ‚ÄúGraf, henin, clijsters has this and that ...‚Äù"
1765,2020-10-09 12:37:14,j7pnvu,Steffi graf has quadruple career grand slam. One of them on one calendar year.
1766,2020-10-09 09:31:58,j7pnvu,All of the greats on the WTA side seem to have had pretty balanced success across all slams
1767,2020-10-09 13:50:43,j7pnvu,nadals insane French open domination is the reason why they only have 1 career GS each..
1768,2020-10-09 16:02:48,j7pnvu,"Not gonna happen. There are lot of young and skilled players right row.

Serena always struggles with injuries in the last matches of Grand Slams."
1769,2020-10-09 06:06:25,j7pnvu,"Firstly, she will never get another GS title, much less 2 more at RG.  Secondly, while a good accomplishment, her triple slam is bested by Stevo, who also had a calendar slam.  The clowns in the US media made up this ridiculous Serena Slam name in the hopes of brainwashing people into thinking she is the GOAT, when clearly she is not even close! Not only was Stefi considerably better than Serena and but Chris Everett, Martina and Court all ahead of her in every metric except longevity. Furthermore, Serena has been very lucky to play in an era where there has not been a dominate woman in the game for more than a very short span. This means her GS titles are well overstated vs if she would have played against even 1 other all time great. If she played in the era of Everett and Graf, she wouldn't even have 10 gs titles, so trying to compare her favorably to the big 3 in the men's game is frankly a joke. At best Serena maybe #5 all time on the women's side and you could make a legit argument she is a few notches lower than that.  Not only that but her horrible antics on court, such as threatening to kill a lines person, the crap she pulled vs Osaka a few years ago etc etc mean she should not ever be put fwd as a roll model, but dont tell that to the pathetic hacks in the US media!"
1770,2020-10-09 14:25:31,j7pnvu,Serena isn't winning two more RG. Lol
1771,2020-10-09 10:40:34,j7pnvu,"Someone please remind me what a career grand slam is, thanks :)."
1772,2020-10-09 14:16:46,j7pnvu,Now you can realise that she'll win 0 more titles at Roland Garros
1773,2020-10-09 16:04:06,j7pnvu,It's insane to have 1 career grandslam when you all are hauling in almost 20 of those.
1774,2020-10-09 12:39:26,j7pnvu,"Serena never had a serious competitor except her sister for a few years. All the other girls were just dwarfs and weaklings compared to her. They come and go quickly, so unremarkable and indistinguishable that you can't even remember their names.

I don't even mean that approvingly, never liked Serena. But she's one of a kind."
1775,2020-10-09 11:41:26,j7pnvu,Haven't seen a more dominant female tennis player.
1776,2020-10-09 09:11:40,j7pnvu,The whataboutism I'm seeing is astounding.
1777,2020-10-09 06:57:34,j7pnvu,"she achieved that before turning 30.  Whereas Rena will be in her 40s if she hopes to have 4 career slams

Someone of Graf's ability could have totalled many more slams if they were playing into their 30s and eeked out 1 or more slams every 2-3 years which seems  the case for  the likes of Williams and Federer. 

I think back in the day , many top players wanted to leave while still they were on top of the game, and didn't want to play into their later years when results go downhill"
1778,2020-10-09 05:34:53,j7pnvu,"Active players, didn't know that Federer, Nadal and Djokovic weren't playing anymore"
1779,2020-10-09 18:49:52,j7pnvu,"The Big Three are impressive because for each member there‚Äôs another two stopping them from winning 30+ slams. Fed without Nadal could have won 2006 / 07 Calendar Grand Slams, 11 straight from French 2005 to USO 2007. Nadal would have won more AO & Wimbledon, Djokovic more French Opens."
1780,2020-10-09 04:32:13,j7pnvu,Why do you find it silly? Obviously they don't compete directly but this is pretty strong evidence of how dominant she has been over her competition.
1781,2020-10-09 05:07:34,j7pnvu,It's not silly at all. Men compete against men. Women compete against women. Fair and square. She has beaten the best players on the planet.
1782,2020-10-09 08:45:25,j7pnvu,"They have 1 career slam, she had  3 already. Nothing hypothetical at the present moment."
1783,2020-10-09 11:55:03,j7pnvu,Sounds like they're comparing her to other active players and there's no one currently on the WTA that comes even close to her stats. Just happens that 3 of the top 5 players ever (imo) are still active but on the male side. It is kinda ridiculous that Roger and Novak have 37 slams combined but only 2 French opens between them
1784,2020-10-09 11:39:40,j7pnvu,"Pardon me, but what you mean by a real slam. I am still a novice in tennis."
1785,2020-10-09 16:20:12,j7pnvu,"I can get it if I win 5 more USO, Wimbledon, AO, and FO each"
1786,2020-10-09 11:21:07,j7pnvu,"Your comment makes no sense.  Graf barely played Martina or Evert at slams, and when she did their careers were winding down.  Serena has defeated a far longer list of high level competition than Graf at slams.  That much is irrefutable.

Navratilova is clearly the greatest female player of all time.  Her combination of singles and doubles title hauls is peerless."
1787,2020-10-09 06:35:10,j7pnvu,"Nice troll lol.

Steffi got a free ride because Monica Seles got stabbed."
1788,2020-10-09 10:36:44,j7pnvu,"It's not whataboutism, it's that you are trying to frame the accomplishment by using  a context and then using the wrong context to illustrate the point.

*Your* post comes across as whataboutism, as it basically reads as ""you guys won't shut up about the big 3 but *what about* Serena and her 3 career grand slams""??

People are simply pointing out the reasons that context setting is flawed."

1794,2020-10-09 22:13:27,j7pnvu,"This argument makes no sense to me. It's like saying Serena would have 15 more slams if Venus and Henin weren't around to stop her in the 00s. Part of what makes Serena, Fed, Nadal, and Novak great is that they had to battle against greatness."

1796,2020-10-09 04:43:19,j7pnvu,"Sure, to me even though its the same sport I consider them essentially 2 different disciplines because there are significant differences (bo3 v bo5 at the slams being the most obvious, on-court coaching at other tournaments etc.) that to me invalidate any comparison in terms of achievement. Like I don't know if Serena's 23 slams are inherently more impressive than Roger's 20 just because 23>20

ninja Edit: like in swimming, I wouldn't compare records between different strokes even if its the same sport"
1797,2020-10-09 06:43:21,j7pnvu,"Because the level in depth of talent in the men's game is far superior to that of the women's game.

Not hating on the women's game but it's true."
1798,2020-10-09 16:27:41,j7pnvu,"One reason I think it's silly in this example is because the big 3 have denied each other many times while Serena never had a rival like herself. Yes, geat players like Venus, Sharapova, Clisters etc, but nothing like the big 3 had in each other."
1799,2020-10-09 05:29:46,j7pnvu,"Karsten Braasch would be the answer. Shows the level of competition, lots vs paper thin"

1802,2020-10-09 09:41:42,j7pnvu,Way more men play tennis than women.
1803,2020-10-09 08:48:30,j7pnvu,"That's true, but then again you just cannot compare the men's and women's tour. The main reason why the big 3 haven't achieved this is because there are three of the best of all time sharing the slams. Serena didn't have that kind of competition."
1804,2020-10-09 11:35:25,j7pnvu,"Not having to play against two other GOATs would probably have allowed at least one of the big 3 to do the same if not better. Fed and novak both have strong results at RG, the only reason they don't have 3 or more titles there is rafa, without rafa there's a decent chance fed could have had 5 at every slam (rafa has beaten him 6 times at RG in SF/F) and novak might have done the same. Similarly rafa likely would have many more titles at the other slams if he didn't have to play fed and novak who have dominated the other slams.

All three would have probably had a ridiculous number of slam titles if the others didn't exist."
1805,2020-10-09 11:45:34,j7pnvu,"I mean a calendar year slam: all four slams in the same year. A Calendar Year Slam is called a Grand Slam. Some people say Serena also achieved a Slam by holding all four at once, but she never did it in one year/season."
1806,2020-10-09 12:33:57,j7pnvu,"So ""grand slam"" actually means winning all 4 in the same year. Then the tournaments are called ""grand slam tournaments"" because they don't have any other name altogether, it is named after the achievement. Most people are unaware of this and shorten it as ""grand slams"" or referring to one of them as a ""grand slam"" but grand slam actually refers to the achievement of winning all 4 in the same year."
1807,2020-10-09 12:36:31,j7pnvu,"> Serena has defeated a far longer list of high level competition than Graf at slams. That much is irrefutable.

Her longevity is much better so the list of her competitors is also longer and overall better. However such a conclusion is not irrefutable because Serena won less slams against better competition in her 20s than he did against worst WTA decade for top player quality in her 30s. That is certainly unnatural."
1808,2020-10-09 09:44:07,j7pnvu,Who was a better player than Serena as well.
1809,2020-10-10 00:20:33,j7pnvu,"Personally I love that they're trying to compare a wta player (whose achievements are inferior to other wta players) to atp players (which are, to be diplomatic, not comparable) just to try to make Serena look good lol"

1811,2020-10-09 18:45:51,j7pnvu,Rena got rona
1812,2020-10-10 00:06:25,j7pnvu,"If you look at a metric like ELO, you'll find that players like rafa, fed and novak are all right up there for highest ever. Serena isn't for females, which is not to say she hasnt had a very long and successful career, but it says something about where she stacks up among the all time greats"
1813,2020-10-09 06:39:19,j7pnvu,"Is it? Loads of people used the term ""Djokovic Slam"" in 2016. Were they seemingly unaware of Rod Laver's actu calender slam? 

If anything, to me the terms ""Serena Slam"" and ""Djokovic Slam"" make it quite clear that their users were hyper aware that these were not calendar slams and instead coined alternative terms to recognise the achievements but also acknowledging they weren't as good as a calendar slam."
1814,2020-10-09 04:59:49,j7pnvu,I would say Serena‚Äôs Slams are not as impressive as Roger. Sure many of Roger‚Äôs Slams were won prior to the GOAT trio becoming a trio but he still had those guys steal those later Slams from him. Serena was not competing against two GOATs so I wouldn‚Äôt value her 23 Slams as higher than Roger‚Äôs 20.
1815,2020-10-09 05:14:14,j7pnvu,"I disagree tbh. The comparison of different swimming strokes isn't accurate. That's more like saying Serena's serve is more powerful than Rogers backhand, so Serena is the better player, I agree that would be silly logic. If one swimmer won 23 gold medals in freestyle and another swimmer won 20 in backstroke it's pretty simple to see that the freestyle winner was more dominant over their respective sports.

I get what you're saying about there being differences between the men's game and the women's game, but all the men follow the same rules, and all the women follow the same rules, so the playing field for each competitor was even."
1816,2020-10-09 11:08:07,j7pnvu,"Interestingly in the 80s and 90s when the women's game had a few dominant players the commentator's pointed to the lack of depth and compared to the strength in depth and spread of slam winners in the men's game.  When the men have concentrated winners the commentator's still point to the fact that the men's game had more depth.

A concentration of winners clearly points to a lack of depth.  The big three are the winning standard and only few players are good enough to win.  The women's game currently has massive depth at it's highest level seen by the competition for slams.

Rafa winning the FO 12 times out of 14 shows the opposite of depth.

By the way I think the men's game is great and I love watching the big three, but you comment regarding depth does not make sense."
1817,2020-10-09 16:20:49,j7pnvu,"> Because the level in depth of talent in the men's game is far superior to that of the women's game.

Today? That's absolutely false.

These are the kinds of birdbrained comments this sub is inundated with during the slams when people who barely watch tennis flock in and post their dogshit takes."
1818,2020-10-09 05:35:53,j7pnvu,Irrelevant. I'm not saying Serena could beat the big 3. Just that she's been completely dominant over her competition.
1819,2020-10-09 11:14:38,j7pnvu,Karsten Braasch 30 yrs old former world no 38 beats 17 yr old Serena and 18 year old Venus in one set battle of the sexes.  Your comment doesn't have any relevance to depth of competition in the women's game does it.
1820,2020-10-09 11:15:57,j7pnvu,Makes Serena's 23 slams even more impressive.  Less margin for error in 3 sets than 5.
1821,2020-10-09 11:31:13,j7pnvu,"Well Rafa at RG is the most dominant player of all time.  His record is peerless.  He is embarrassingly dominant.  He has had no competition during his entire career at RG.  That is the only reason both Rog and Nole aren't currently three or four times career slam winners.  Serena had competition at all the slams.

By the way I love watching Rafa, but statistically I hope you understand my point."
1822,2020-10-09 11:47:53,j7pnvu,Thanks.
1823,2020-10-09 14:43:19,j7pnvu,"I definitely agree that Graf won more when you compare at the age of 29.  You do then end up with the other argument that Grafs only real competition was Seles who was winning everything bar Wimbledon before she was stabbed, and that Graf ended up with minimal competition until Davenport, Hingis and Williams sisters came along, at which point she was no longer the dominant force, although she was suffering with numerous injuries.

Grafs game was not complete enough when the better players that could match her came through. Her backhand weaknesses started to become more of a liability.  Although she has just about the best backhand slice of all time on either tour.  She would not have stood up to well to Serena's style of play had she stuck around a few more years like Serena has done (even if she was injury free). Serena's game survives into her 30s because of her style of play and how good she is off serve and the ground."
1824,2020-10-09 11:23:56,j7pnvu,"Whilst Seles is amongst my favourite players of all time, it is clearly mischievous to say she was better than Serena.  I think Seles matches Serena off the ground for power and she might be more consistent, but Serena's serve is peerless, and her movement also better than Seles.  Seles did read the game better."
1825,2020-10-09 10:32:10,j7pnvu,"No because he didnot do it in the open era . It's silly to compare tennis before and after open era , their wasnt enough competition ."

1827,2020-10-09 08:45:10,j7pnvu,But then couldn't you argue that Serena had no serious competition because she's so far ahead?
1828,2020-10-10 00:13:25,j7pnvu,"Compare nba titles to wnba titles. Nevermind it being a team sport, you just know the level is higher in one over the other."
1829,2020-10-09 19:33:33,j7pnvu,"I understand your point, however the big 3 are clearly head a shoulders above the rest, in Serenas prime there was only her who was head and shoulders above the rest.

In regards to depth I was meaning players who you would regard as (not to hate on players here I'm just struggling to find the correct word) world class. You take the big 3 out of the equation and you can still name many male players who were world class. You jump to the Era when Serena was dominating and then take her out if the equation, how many players can you name who were honestly world class maybe 5?

Granted the women's game is getting stronger and more competitive now but 5 years ago it just wasn't."
1830,2020-10-09 12:41:16,j7pnvu,you are talking about the depth of competition which has a little value ( almost every division of every sport has a depth of competition ) compared to the depth of talent
1831,2020-10-09 19:27:23,j7pnvu,If you wasn't a bird brain you'd be able to work out Serena isn't dominating anymore so I clearly wasn't stating today was I. Absolute clown mate
1832,2020-10-09 11:00:58,j7pnvu,"She couldn't beat Braasch when he was knocking down beers, of course she isn't going to beat the big 3, she would be flat out getting 2 games off Bernard Tomic"
1833,2020-10-10 09:01:15,j7pnvu,"It does, it appears you're too thick to comprehend it. Great effort cherry picking the facts. He was ranked 204 at the time, had played 36 holes of golf and smoked a whole pack of cigarettes while playing, after golf he'd had 3 or 4 beers, so you'd imagine probably a bit tired, and here's the most important part, he had to hold back while playing because they struggled to have a 3 shot rally if he didn't and he still won 6-1 & 6-2, where the second player would have had him dead on his feet. Former World 38? Bernard Tomic is a former World 17 and still in his 20's, so Braasch at the time was where Bernard will be is 6-7 years, just to give you some perspective."
1834,2020-10-09 15:17:54,j7pnvu,Hard disagree. In no world is BO3 more impressive than BO5.
1835,2020-10-09 14:48:53,j7pnvu,"My argument isn't about comparing the two what they did until age 30. It frankly has nothing to do with Graf, just with Serena's unnatural career trajectory where she had more success in her 30s than in her 20s. And her competition was much stronger in her 20s so she did worse at one's usual prime years vs tougher top level competition. 

>You do then end up with the other argument that Grafs only real competition was Seles 

What? I mean if that's the bar (where we only name fierce rivalries) then Serena had no competition because Seles is better than Venus and Henin. That'd be your thinking, not mine btw. 

>Grafs game was not complete enough when the better players that could match her came through.

Who had a more complete game than hers?

>Her backhand weaknesses started to become more of a liability.

Eh, this is like saying the same for Federer. And obviously Federer is still a proper GOAT candidate just like Graf is."
1836,2020-10-09 15:44:27,j7pnvu,"She was more successful until she got stabbed. However, we can't really compare players from different decades."
1837,2020-10-09 12:54:29,j7pnvu,"I fundamentally disagree. Just because the achievement isn't as good as winning a calendar slam doesn't mean it shouldn't be recognised and given its own ""term"". At the end of the day the players still held all 4 at the same time. I'd wager Serena's was a little more impressive because of the true RG-Wimbledon double (on both occasions given she's done the Serena Slam twice) but the point remains both are fantastic achievements and deserved recognition."
1838,2020-10-09 08:51:44,j7pnvu,"Well Steffi Graf, Navratilova, and Chris Evert got their slam totals while mostly competing against each other. Isn't that more impressive?"
1839,2020-10-09 15:21:24,j7pnvu,"My argument is based on the consistency of her Rivals. Serena isn‚Äôt eliminating her rivals every time. They are often not making it as deep. For example Wozniacki was one of Serena‚Äôs ‚Äúrivals‚Äù that she dominated and she only made the finals 3 times. If Serena was the reason why everyone else was held back, we‚Äôd see a lot more finals appearances by everyone else."
1840,2020-10-09 14:49:58,j7pnvu,"I would have thought competition was representative of talent, otherwise your comment is completely arbitrary and based on personal opinion as opposed to statistical."
1841,2020-10-10 13:24:32,j7pnvu,"Oh, I understood the point you (and Braasch) were trying to make.  I just think you should keep the hate to yourself bro, and not try and mingle it with tennis talk."
1842,2020-10-09 15:23:28,j7pnvu,But you are comparing records at majors and drawing a comparison between BO5 vs BO3.  BO5 clearly provides some advantage to guys with superior fitness.
1843,2020-10-09 15:16:57,j7pnvu,"Serena's played 22 more slams than Graf to date.  She's played a lot less at respective ages up to 30 due to her own injuries throughout her career.

Serena has following notable wins at slams vs other multiple slam winners mostly in their primes:

Venus 11 wins
Azarenka 10 wins
Sharapova 8 wins
Mauresmo 5 wins
Li Na 4 wins
Davenport 3 wins
Capriati 3 wins
Henin 3 wins
Kuznetsova 3 wins
Kvitova 3 wins
Halep 3 wins
Muguruza 3 wins
Hingis 2 wins 
Clijsters 2 wins
Kerber 2 wins
Pierce 1 win
Seles 1 win

I think there's 17 players and 67 wins competing at a total of 76 slams vs other multiple slam winners (ie 0.88 per slam). My list might not be perfect.¬† But that is very healthy competition that she's faced and beaten in achieving her 23 slams.¬† I'm a huge fan of Steffi, but her equivalent list is not anywhere near as impressive as that.¬† 

Steffi's most notable wins at slams against multiple slam winners are made up of the following:

Sanchez-Vicario 9 wins
Seles 6 wins
Capriati 5 wins
Navratilova 4 wins
Evert 3 wins
Hingis 3 wins
Davenport 2 wins
Pierce 1 win

Which is 8 players, 33 wins in 54 slams at a ratio of 0.61 per slam.

I'm not into only naming fierce rivalries, you can see the list of players and the frequency.  Graf had less competition.  Seles wasn't just a rival she just happened to be the no.1 player, and Graf did a lot of winning directly after.

I'm not saying Graf isn't one of the greats, she clearly is, and was, in her prime majestic, but she did not consistently face the depth or calibre of opponent that Serena did in her 20s or 30s."
1844,2020-10-09 12:56:42,j7pnvu,[deleted]
1845,2020-10-09 10:55:06,j7pnvu,"This comment sounds good until you realise that Graf barely played Martina or Evert at the slams.

I'm a huge fan of Graf and Serena, but Serena has played way deeper competition and achieved far more big wins against top opposition at slams than Graf.

1846,2020-10-09 09:14:15,j7pnvu,"Maybe. I'm a new tennis fan, so I don't know much of the history. You're right, though. If it's accepted that the three you mentioned are around Serena's level, then it means they had much greater competition. I was just going on the idea that Serena is the GOAT women's player."
1847,2020-10-09 17:34:45,j7pnvu,"no it's not, you can have a competitive field with less talent and vice versa... , in the end talent and levels of play matters most otherwise people will just switch to 8th division of english football instead of the premier league just because 2 club are dominating the league over the last few years and the 8th division is more competitive."
1848,2020-10-09 15:51:57,j7pnvu,"No, OP was comparing records at majors. I‚Äôm saying you can‚Äôt, because it‚Äôs an entirely different proposition."
1849,2020-10-09 21:42:52,j7pnvu,"You are missing the point mate. This comment was unnecessary because read what I had written in my very first response to you:

>Her longevity is much better so the list of her competitors is also longer and overall better. 

Your last comment is the laid out version of that sentence. It might as well be written by myself. Hell, that's precisely why I ridiculed the notion that Seles was Graf's only competition because logically all players who are threats at slams are competition. Even if Graf is much better than Sabatini and Serena much better than Azarenka.

My point is, having nothing to do with Graf really, Serena has unnatural career trajectory where she is more successful at her age 30s than her age 20s. Players don't get better at their 30s, they get worse, as we see with big 3. Then we look at her competition and see the possible reasoning, her top level competition at her 20s was much better than her top level competition at her 30s. 

This is why it is not irrefutable that Serena faced tougher competition because one could argue Serena inflated her achievements (slam count, weeks at #1, etc.) in her 30s than she normally would had she not gone through the weakest WTA decade for top player quality."
1850,2020-10-09 18:51:58,j7pnvu,Yeah Calendar Slam is mentally one million times tougher due to its Shiny Charizard rareness
1851,2020-10-09 14:27:50,j7pnvu,AGREED
1852,2020-10-09 11:07:18,j7pnvu,"Yeah true, their careers overlapped is what I was getting at.

Graf had some exceptional competition in her time too though."
1853,2020-10-09 11:08:59,j7pnvu,"She may well be the GOAT.

But the numbers actually make it quite a bit more debatable than most people let on nowadays, perhaps with recency bias."
1854,2020-10-10 02:58:29,j7pnvu,"That's why the ratio is important it normalises things.  Serena has statistically per tournament played stronger competition 0.88 vs 0.61 on the ratio provided.

Also Serena has won more singles slams prior to her 30s.  10 vs 13.  Won less titles in total.  She's dropped doubles from her itinerary winning only 2 slams versus 16.  I haven't got the stats on her win:loss ratio but I'd likely it is worse in her 30s.

I do agree she's had her statistical peak between 30-34, she was a far better technician, but not as good an athlete by then.  But I think she was lightening her load, had less injuries etc.

Seles wasn't Grafs only competition but she was her mai competition.  She was the most dominant player by a stretch.  Talking about Serena's weak competition without highlighting the absence of Seles during a magnificent period for Graf is not equitable in my view.

The big three arent worse they are crushing the competition in their 30s.  Thiem win is notable because Roger and Rafa are absent and Novak the odds on winner was DQ'ed.  If Roger wasn't injured the likely top three in the world would be Novak, Rafa and Roger (at 39). Roger is winning slams well into the middle of 30s. Murray would likely be there if not for his well document issues.  In fact Murray had his best ever season at 29 and was about to go into his 30s at his peak.

Serena career is similar to Rogers in respect of competitiveness.  Players winning in 30s is not the rarity it once was."
1855,2020-10-09 11:34:21,j7pnvu,"If you check out who Serena has beaten at slams vs Graf you will see that Serena's fought far greater depth than Graf.  I believe that Graf is the greatest athlete that ever hit the women's tour, but she's not had the level of competition in her cv."
1856,2020-10-10 03:16:21,j7pnvu,"The ratio is very, very flawed. You are equalling somebody who is like the 45th best player ever to somebody who is like the 25th best player ever. Not to mention it is completely devoid of context. It could be very well, likely in a lot of cases that, the inferior player (the 45th for example) was much better at that stage of her career when Serena beat her than the 25th ranked all time player when Graf beat her. You see, this has nothing to do with comparing Graf and Serena's competition, the ratio approach is fundamentally and inherently, quite extremely flawed.

>Also Serena has won more singles slams prior to her 30s. 10 vs 13

It's 10 vs 12 actually. But the point is, she won first 13 in 12 years. She won the next 10 in 6 years all in her 30s. 

>Talking about Serena's weak competition without highlighting the absence of Seles during a magnificent period for Graf is not equitable in my view.

For the 3rd bloody time, the argument about Serena's competition is not a comparison of Serena's vs Graf's competition, it is a comparison of Serena's comparison in her 20s vs Serena's competition in her 30s. 

>The big three arent worse 

lol no offence but if you think big 3 are now at the same level of play as their primes you don't know shit about evaluating tennis performance. 

Also using Andy Murray as an example of increased longevity is nuts. The total speculative ""He was about to peak if not for career ending injury"" could be used for so many retired players you are not using the same speculative theory on but merely as a comparative tool without using same speculative theory to display the contrast you want to display. Just poor argumentation all around there."
1857,2020-10-10 04:39:32,j7pnvu,"Ok, so the big three are completely dominating a much weaker tour now they are in their 30s.  Yup Andy Murray is speculation due to injury, think I made that point, but anyway.

Of the top 5 women slam winners ie Court, Williams, Graf, Evert and Navratilova, only Graf wasn't winning slams in her 30s, so maybe she is the odd one out as opposed to Serena?  Maybe Serena's longevity is due to modern methods of training, that's what the big three have references before. Or maybe it's superior technique?"
1858,2020-10-10 17:06:30,j7pnvu,"> so maybe she is the odd one out as opposed to Serena

Are you saying winning 10 slams in 6 years in 30s and 13 slams in 12 years in your teens and 20s is not an unnatural thing? Who else has such slam distribution? Maybe Rosewall if you don't count his pro slams as he was disallowed to attend slams between ages 27-37 or something.

>Maybe Serena's longevity is 

Longevity is not relevant. Longevity is a natural thing and boosts Serena's best ever candidacy. The point is Serena peaking achievement-wise in her 30s, that's the unnatural thing in a career."
1859,2020-10-10 17:38:07,j7pnvu,"You think it's unnatural, not me.  She has the best serve of all-time, one of the best forehands the game has ever seen, and for the first time in her 30s she has a professional coach that gives her a match play education.  She begins using the width of the court to spread her opponents rather than using brute force and hitting straight down the lines.  That's development, improvement, whatever you want to call it.

You're trying to imply that the players she played in her 30s ie Venus, Sharapova, Azarenka, Li Na, Kerber, Kvitova, Muguruza, Halep are somehow weaker more easily bested players.  I don't agree."
1860,2020-10-10 17:39:15,j7pnvu,You don't agree. So you think her competition in her 20s was worse than 2010s WTA?
1861,2020-10-10 17:52:40,j7pnvu,"I think the WTA competition in both periods represent the strongest two decades on the WTA tour since the tour was formed, which is my personal opinion."
1862,2020-10-10 17:57:29,j7pnvu,And you're entitled to that obviously but this doesn't answer the question.
1863,2020-10-10 18:38:30,j7pnvu,I've answered your question about why I believe Serena has had such success in her 30s based on my opinion.  You're entitled to a different one.
1864,2020-10-10 19:00:15,j7pnvu,"You didn't answer *this* question:

> So you think her competition in her 20s was worse than 2010s WTA?

I meant, by saying:

>but this doesn't answer the question

upon you saying 2000s and 2010s WTA are the top 2 decades of the tour."
1865,2020-10-10 23:13:52,j7pnvu,"I don't think there is a lot in it. I would give the 2000s a slight edge,  but I think if not for significant issues in her personal life and physically Serena may have won more slams.  But I also think Serena was at her best as a match player after Patrick joined the team, maybe not physically as she was not the outstanding athlete she had been in late teens and early 20s, but technically and as a match player she was way superior in my view."
1866,2020-10-08 16:57:08,j7fp1s,Eh it‚Äôs actually Navratilova - you didn‚Äôt specify singles or doubles. So this result is also factually incorrect.

They shouldn‚Äôt have that unless the algorithm is good enough to have the actual correct answer. And there is such thing as algorithmic bias that most likely has a role in this.
Btw that‚Äôs actually not true (as I said earlier) because my search specifically said Open Era. Even without searching ‚Äúin the open era‚Äù the answer comes up as Federer.
Technically, as someone else pointed out, the answer is Martina Navratilova because of her doubles titles. But again, even when specifying singles, the answer is STILL Federer. So in almost all cases google‚Äôs answer is wrong."

When Medvedev or Pliskova actually physically attacked the umpire's chair people either find it funny or look to find reasons to explain why they did it. If Serena argues with an umpire occasionally it's because she's a horrible person and all of those years and near 1000 matches of accepting decisions perfectly fine go out the window. Even that incident with Thiem last year, people (including Thiem himself) were so quick to lay into her until it transpired that none of it was her fault.

Not saying the double standard she faces is because of her race or gender but she is treated way more harshly than other players by the tennis watching public."
1940,2020-10-09 11:10:04,j6tr39,"Underpaid and undervalued? She is one of the top paid sports people, man or woman and has been for years. She is the 2nd highest paid female athlete, recently topped by Osaka and until Sharapova failed a drugs test was second to her.  
Calling on her BS"
1941,2020-10-07 16:34:42,j6tr39,"boo hoo I make only a couple of million per tournament, there's obviously a conspiracy against black women."
1942,2020-10-07 16:31:24,j6tr39,"still very underpaid compared to what she'd get as a male athlete of similar dominance, or what she'd get in endorsement deals if she was a white woman of conventional attractiveness (Sharapova always made much more money there)"
1943,2020-10-07 17:16:01,j6tr39,"yeah, it's just a summary[ of another article](https://www.vogue.co.uk/arts-and-lifestyle/article/serena-williams-interview). but even the full article isn't super deep. Vogue articles are, unfortunately, pretty vapid. Teen Vogue, weirdly, is a better magazine for deeper issues"
1944,2020-10-07 16:42:30,j6tr39,"But is dominance the issue here? I'd imagine the difference is based of the amount of viewers/attendees one pulls. It's not a big stretch to say the majority of tennis fans likes the men's game better, so it would automatically attract more viewers/attendees. Not saying the difference shouldn't be evaluated, but to say she should get the same amount as the top players in the men's game is just a bit silly"
1945,2020-10-07 16:39:03,j6tr39,Djokovic make less money than federer and nadal and he's been the best player since 2011 commercial apeal is important
1946,2020-10-07 16:34:09,j6tr39,Sharapova made money out of her prettyness if serena was as pretty and still made less money then we could talk about racism
1947,2020-10-07 16:38:13,j6tr39,"Yes, it's possible to both be highly paid, and still underpaid/undervalued."
1948,2020-10-07 17:06:24,j6tr39,"this is such a self-fulfilling and racist cycle though. companies largely define trends and what is consumed. companies say black women don't appeal, so they don't put a black woman as a face of their company, then use the lack of black women in brands as a reason that they don't hire more black women. Serena is also...*hugely* popular, so that's a weird argument to make. 

Makeup is a good example of this. Brand puts out 15 shades of foundation for lighter skin tones, but only two for darker. People with darker skin can't buy that brand because there isn't any variety for them. Then...we don't need to expand with more colors because black women don't buy our makeup. Then they're blown away when Fenty is a huge success. 

movie studios say directors that are women don't make as much money, so they don't hire women, and then use that to say that women don't bring in big bucks."
1949,2020-10-07 16:56:45,j6tr39,Where did you get that info from? According to Forbes Djokovic is ahead of Nadal and he earns a little bit more from endorsements. Federer is way ahead of both of them though
1950,2020-10-07 17:10:22,j6tr39,They're both about the same level of prettiness if you're going to go by objective measures such as facial symmetry and proportion.
1951,2020-10-07 17:08:51,j6tr39,I'm not saying there's no problem I'm saying that serena is a bad exemple for those problem
1952,2020-10-07 17:38:52,j6tr39,"Agreed on almost everything. However, Serena isn't a good example for commercials or endorsements, because overall, she isn't truly likeable in the general sense. Compared to federer for example, she just doesn't have the same reach. Ofcourse this is partially because of the things you brought up, but it's also caused by her personality/charisma"
1953,2020-10-07 17:20:20,j6tr39,If you say so
1954,2020-10-07 08:08:05,j6mra8,"Year-end #1, having played 14 matches :)"

1956,2020-10-07 09:11:56,j6mra8,"

That dominance by Steffi Graff is unreal."
1957,2020-10-07 09:17:52,j6mra8,Serena only achieved that for the first time in 2014?
1958,2020-10-07 09:35:54,j6mra8,Wait it legitimately counts????
1959,2020-10-07 08:47:01,j6mra8,An achievement that will be placed next to a beautiful asterisk.
1960,2020-10-07 08:56:03,j6mra8,Year End World number 1*
1961,2020-10-07 10:39:45,j6mra8,Does it really count considering some months of the year weren't counted towards the ranking ?
1962,2020-10-07 15:17:34,j6mra8,I‚Äôm curious on how Barty can handle defending #1 for hopefully a whole year next year. I still can‚Äôt get a read on how dominant she can be. It‚Äôs easier being the hunter than the hunted!
1963,2020-10-07 11:59:25,j6mra8,In a normal year you tell someone the World #1 only played 14 matches and they'd assume it was 2 grand slam wins.
1964,2020-10-07 12:43:21,j6mra8,"Graf is the best of all time for me, incredible player."
1965,2020-10-07 16:14:10,j6mra8,"Skips a lot of tournaments and prioritizes grand slams, so even though she collects GS trophies like mad, she doesn't get enough points to stay at #1."
1966,2020-10-07 11:06:29,j6mra8,"Yep

Serena was first No. 1 in June 2002 which lasted till August 2003 when Kim took over. Then it was between her, Jankovic and Safina in 2008/2009. Then she became World No. 1 in Feb 2013 taking over from Vika who started the year No. 1. She then held it across the rest of 2013, 2014 and 2015 until Kerber took it away from her in September 2016."
1967,2020-10-07 11:10:33,j6mra8,Well she started the year No. 1 and is finishing the year No. 1 without anyone taking it away from her.
1968,2020-10-07 16:05:48,j6mra8,"Even then, 4000 points is not enough to be #1."
1969,2020-10-08 02:43:04,j6mra8,"It would be if the rest of the field played very even, so the other 2 slams go to people who crash out early in Masters, etc."
1970,2020-10-07 04:43:30,j6ko4d,"Because that's about when Twitter suddenly got really big, not just among celebrities https://blog.rjmetrics.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2010/01/twitter1.jpg"
1971,2020-10-07 04:46:55,j6ko4d,"Twitter was a completely unknown entity offering an entirely new service when it launched. No one knew what it was, the whole idea (140-character limit) sounded ridiculously dumb, and the site was plagued by outages. In other words, it took a little while to get off the ground. Early 2009 is when it started to become exponentially more popular, particularly among American celebrities."
1972,2020-10-07 06:02:19,j6ko4d,Worth considering that these people are generally represented by agencies that have lots of clients.  One major agency deciding to make a push of getting their clients onto Twitter (and maybe operating the accounts for them) could bring a bunch of celebrities all at once.
1973,2020-10-07 04:45:50,j6ko4d,Interesting how it dramatically falls in May 2009 before rebounding at a peak around June 2009.
1974,2020-10-07 04:48:34,j6ko4d,"I agree. Interesting how Obama and Biden joined the platform in March 2007, which is about the earliest I can find for a high-profile celebrity."
1975,2020-10-07 04:53:23,j6ko4d,"I‚Äôll admit, Biden is surprising to me. Obama had the young, hip, upstart campaign from the jump, so it‚Äôs no surprise that he got on Twitter within a month of declaring his candidacy. But Biden? Somebody on his team was young and prescient."
1976,2020-10-07 05:02:14,j6kg7h,"Well, she is a fucking nut. Nobody knows when she is going to play, whether she is going to drop out, or whether she will even show up ready to play."
1977,2020-10-07 04:24:53,j6kg7h,"Someone want to tell her, maybe she's just not that good or maybe, no one likes her attitude?"
1978,2020-10-06 17:50:16,j69pny,"Comparatively i assume. Although, yeah, it is hard to listen to a multi millionaire whinge. Great ass though."
1979,2020-10-06 18:28:51,j69pny,"> Comparatively i assume. 

To what?? $200m net worth is probably in the top 15 or 20 highest net worth for athletes globally of all time."

Seriously???"
1981,2020-10-06 20:28:54,j69pny,"I'm guessing she's paid less per match ? I don't know man, she must think she has a point."
1982,2020-10-06 19:39:01,j69pny,It‚Äôs definitely a 300 million dollar ass..

Well I guess I'm all team Anisimova now"
2004,2020-10-02 13:01:42,j3ixe7,I bet against anderson twice and he has won twice. Time to bet for old manderson. There will be a few upsets. Big test for zverev. Marco beat nole a couple years back at the french open.

2008,2020-10-02 17:53:20,j3ixe7,"Cecchinato wasn't informed there would be a net for this match ... very unfair, hopefully someone tells him he'll have to hit it over it ... quicker start than usual for Zverev here if he can get an early break in the second he probably runs away with this"

Everytime I do a search for these...  i only see ppl as or recent purchasing from coco ..and no ones happy with the QC.


Imma check out AK247. (Edit:  ALL KICKS SITE is not showing pics)

Six big corporations own most of the major US media companies and that is just ""freedom of speech"". As Castro said free speech in the US just means the right for everyone else to hear the speech of the mega rich. 

I'd 100% prefer to live in a country like China where any racially inciteful speech will not be tolerated. Yes, if Han Chinese tried to form a KKK style group to go after Uyghurs or Tibetans that would be seriously dealt with by the CCP. Anything that ruins social cohesion is cut down. That is the civilized way to deal with things, in the West they pretend you have to let everyone get incited by race and religion. It just leads to bloodshed in the end.

>Another event dubbed a ""Battle of the Sexes"" took place during the 1998 Australian Open[56] between Karsten Braasch and the Williams sisters. Venus and Serena Williams had claimed that they could beat any male player ranked outside the world's top 200, so Braasch, then ranked 203rd, challenged them both. Braasch was described by one journalist as ""a man whose training regime centered around a pack of cigarettes and more than a couple of bottles of ice cold lager"".[57][56] The matches took place on court number 12 in Melbourne Park,[58] after Braasch had finished a round of golf and two shandies. He first took on Serena and after leading 5‚Äì0, beat her 6‚Äì1. Venus then walked on court and again Braasch was victorious, this time winning 6‚Äì2.[56] Braasch said afterwards, ""500 and above, no chance"". He added that he had played like someone ranked 600th in order to keep the game ""fun""[59] and that the big difference was that men can chase down shots much easier and put spin on the ball that female players can't handle. The Williams sisters adjusted their claim to beating men outside the top 350.

BY¬†[NIKHIL CHAUHAN](https://www.essentiallysports.com/author/nikhil-chauhan/)

OCTOBER 26, 2020

Ôøº

Recently, rising lightweight contender Ryan Garcia spoke about the cruelty that lies within the boxing world.

Speaking about the hatred and disrespect that a fighter has to go through because of one bad performance, Garcia stated that it is unfair on fans‚Äô part to write-off athletes for one poor performance. Garcia added that such disparity lies more in the realm of boxing than MMA.

The world of combat sports is cruel. Fight fans regularly shift between fighters, and the fan-base continues to change with the passing time. There is no knowing when the hype train will derail, or when the fight fans will move past their favorite athletes.

Ôøº[

It won‚Äôt be wrong to say that this era was lucky to witness two incredible athletes in the form of Khabib Nurmagomedov and Floyd Mayweather, who retired with an impeccable record.

Both athletes remained undefeated, having retired from the sport of MMA and boxing, respectively. However, these are exceptional cases.

Ryan Garcia feels boxers deserve more respect regardless of the outcome of the fight

Speaking to¬†[Sky Sports](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIHuK8KLybc), Garcia said that it‚Äôs unfair for fans to write-off boxers with just one bad performance. He claimed that such kind of approach doesn‚Äôt exist in the world of MMA, where a fighter is credited for stepping inside the cage.

‚ÄúI even wrote on Twitter the other day. In boxing, opinion and narratives change from fight to fight. What I mean by that is don‚Äôt pay attention to what people say, especially in boxing, it‚Äôs very unfair if you think about it.

Ôøº

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got the UFC where if you lose, you showed up, right? You get in there, and you get respect. I don‚Äôt know what happened to the boxing fans, but they definitely have lost respect for people that lose.

‚ÄúI mean everybody loses, Serena Williams loses, [Cristiano] Ronaldo has lost before. You see legends lose, it‚Äôs not the end of the world, you can come back and win and get better. I definitely think it‚Äôs unfair to the boxers,‚Äù¬†Garcia said.


It‚Äôs hard not to agree with Ryan Garcia. Recently,¬†[Vasyl Lomachenko](https://www.essentiallysports.com/tag/vasyl-lomachenko/)¬†received a lot of flak after his loss inside the ring. Earlier, we have seen boxing fans write-off Deontay Wilder, following his lackluster performance against Tyson Fury in the rematch in February.

At a time where a boxer‚Äôs resume speaks volumes about the fighter‚Äôs achievements, an undefeated record certainly adds to the glory. However, having said that, we have to agree with Ryan Garcia. The world of combat sports has evidently shrugged off some of the best athletes to step inside the ring because of one bad outing.

Ôøº"
2264,2020-10-27 15:35:50,jj2ot4,"He isn't wrong but boxing is structured differently than the other sports. The UFC is already an elite organization with the best MMA fighters in the world. Boxing is an open pool with a relatively low ceiling. It's not always that hard to get a belt for non elite fighters and some very questionable fighters ended up being world champion. It's never the case in the UFC, in Tennis or in Football (Soccer for the American lads). 

Because of that, fans took the bad habit to discredit fighters after a loss. Most fighters build up their careers by stacking wins against journeymen and poor opposition so whenever they end up losing against good opposition, it's hard for fans to not discredit a fighter. It's not always justified but it's like NBA fans discrediting players for one bad playoff series. In 2011 LeBron had a very bad finals series. Since then he won 4 finals and 4 finals MVP but a lot of NBA fans since criticize him for losing poorly in 2011...9 years later! 

Unless promoters drastically cut their numbers of fighters to only organize fights among the best, I don't see boxing fans changing their views."

2268,2020-10-27 17:43:01,jj2ot4,"This happens because of promoters, fighters, and management switching to a play it safe regime. You let guys build his hype off of feasting on janitors, grocery baggers, pizza dough flippers , etc low level talent so called ""building em up"" and their hype for years before he takes on a challenge in boxing. This shit didn't happen in the 80s and 90s because top guys didn't spend 6 years fucking around and fought each other. Same goes for UFC under it's one monopoly control. That being said people still respect guys like Pacquiao, Marquez, Whyte, Farmer, Porter, Garc√≠a, Prograis, Malignaggi, etc after their losses (save for maybe other boxing rivals in some cases lol). Only when the hype has been erected so damn high or you or the people around you wrote a very large check that's gotta be cashed is when you should really worry.

Anyway sounds like Mr Im Gonna Retire At 26 has a little bit of fear about December. Good luck to him. Cuz his ass kinda did write a lot of checks.

Also, I dont really watch other sports but occasionally I'll track basketball and/or soccer. I remember LeBron doesn't have 6 rings trashing. The means when they get kicked out the finals when he was in the Heat one year. The warriors blowing a 2-3 lead was a meme for a long time...and something with the Falcons vs Patriots that one year."

2270,2020-10-28 08:48:41,jj2ot4,"Floyd somewhat screwed the game up protecting the ""0"" at all costs and now most fighters seemingly want to follow in his footsteps since that's where the money (no pun intended) is.

As fans, I don't think a loss bothers us as much as the ""how"" & ""why"" of the L.  No one is knocking Canelo, GGG, Manny, Porter, etc. for having L's on their resumes because they were all against top competition and/or close fights where the decision could've gone either way.  Guys showed up in shape and put up a good fight, win or lose.  I think the comeback also matters and can help mitigate the loss.  Do you rebound from your L and continue (mostly) winning future fights against decent competition?  Flip side of that coin are guys who are undisciplined who constantly miss weight, make lame excuses for their loss, just general POS's outside of the ring, too much hype too fast without the resume to back it up, etc.  Far less forgiving for those L's.

Definitely not breaking news here, but when it comes to Garcia, non-boxing fans probably grossly outnumber the amount of pure ""boxing"" fans he has.  Seems like his demo is far more 16 year old girls than the boxeo hardcores.  Not seeing guys like GGG constantly posting thirst-trap pics of themselves in their underwear on social media, so that probably tends to rub some of us the wrong way.  More than any fighter out right now he seems to be the one most propped up by their promoter and with the potential to be exposed as some other posts have stated. Can respect his speed & power for this size but I'll need to see him get some W's against decent competition before I'd forgive an L on his resume."

But I do really wish we could consider 0 loss fighters untested rather than unstoppable. Since the sport hasn't grown like soccer or football it's created a lot of risk-averse attitudes, but imagine a world where Fury-AJ, Spence-Porter, and these other natural rivalries were all on their second or third installment by now because they met earlier in their careers.

2298,2020-10-25 20:38:58,jhxf5c,"First off. I was a vegan. I was born to a farming family. And am a farmer now. Had been the whole time. I went vegan not for the animals because I know they are not abused. They are not mistreated. They are not humans. I went vegan because of the so called health benefits they kept claiming would happen. When your former doctor refuses to do anything test wise to find out why you would go into pain so deepily that you would drop to the ground and twitch till it passed. Your periods either never came or never left. 8 months to a year. No period. Then 3 months of non stop bleeding heavily. Etc. There was other things. But I‚Äôm just giving the base. He said it was all weight. At the time I had some friends that where vegan and swore it was the cure all. I was so sick I was willing to try anything. I tried the vegan diet till I ended up in the hospital on drips due to malnutrition and dehydration and an emergency gallbladder removal. 
Now with that out of the way. Again I will address the animal part.  What you see is the gore fetish vegans. They want you to think about the abuse. And go vegan because of abuse. Go vegan. Not help the animals. Not press for change. No. Just eat plants?  
First off. Abuse is not the norm. When they go on about debeaking and such, there are reasons for it. Such as keeping the birds from hurting each other. Now small time breeders. Back yard farmers and such don‚Äùt  need to do that much. Why?  Because the birds have more space. More to do. The eggs are not the profit. Those farmers need the profit to keep going. So. We go back to the issue. Going vegan for the animals doesn‚Äôt help animals. Paying a fair price for a product helps animals. Sadly because we aren‚Äôt paid enough, we seek to buy at its cheapest. So it needs to be sold at its cheapest which makes the farmers and producers need to make more and faster to make ends meet.  
Take Cornish cross chickens. You‚Äôll see this all over animal sanctuaries... for a short time. Because they all die no matter what vet care they get too. Why?  Because the internal organs grow to big and shut down because that‚Äôs what their bodies do. They are bred to grow large and fast. That is the meat you see in stores normally. Because if you try and keep them over three months. They die!  But people don‚Äôt understand this because ‚Äúa chicken can live to 15!‚Äù You‚Äôll hear. But what breed?  What conditions? A human can live to 100.. unless it doesn‚Äôt. 
Abuse is not the norm again. As a farmer we have to carefully fet who comes into the barns and farms. There‚Äôs been a massive upsurge in people getting jobs in farming to make gore vids for the internet. There‚Äôs an upswing in people sneaking into farms to release animals. Free them. Hurt them. Then claim it happened at the farm and they are hero‚Äôs for ‚Äúhelping‚Äù?  My first encounter was with a group of teens who had drive three hours out of their city into the country after seeing cowspirisy, they had stopped randomly and opened gates to the cattle fields and chased the cattle out to the highway then left them. I was one of the luckier ones. My dairy girls lived near the farmhouse and the bellowing woke me before a car could hit them. They where All confused as to why routine was broken. They couldn‚Äôt get to the barn. The gates closed. So they cried out and at first. I though the gate wasn‚Äôt latched. Was very mad at myself. Till the reports came in and the police came over the next few day‚Äôs. A lot of cattle where killed by trucks and cars. Some people where in the hospital from the run in with cattle. Farmers at first where going to be charged for animals at large. Till the police found the culprits. How?  YouTube. They video‚Äùd it all and where very proud of it. They ‚Äúfreed‚Äù all these animals you see. No thought to the animals confusion and terror at being chased out to a road. Unable to get back to a familiar place. And some getting killed. 
We can go on about dairy and how it‚Äôs cruel to have the babies moved from the mothers but that‚Äôs old hat. It‚Äôs to keep them dying from diease. Numbers prove this works and I myself know my girls are poor mothers. They might lick. Let it nurse but care for it?  She‚Äôll walk off and leave it anywhere. Someone kick it?  She doesn‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs in her food?  She‚Äôll butt it out. If it kills the calf she doesn‚Äôt understand.  I move them to shelters. So all the work. Raise them and then release them where one day they will be milked along with their mothers sisters and grand mothers. Hear about them killed at five?  Maybe somewhere. But that‚Äôs not the norm. I couldn‚Äôt afford to do that. Nor would i want too. The older a cow gets the longer she gives milk without needing to breed. A lot don‚Äôt know that. Give a bit less sure. But non stop. No downtime. It balances out.  Many family farms do this too. People love to go on about factory farms. A peta coined term. Really is no such thing. But what you think is where animals are abused in a factory setting. When mostly it‚Äôs more they aren‚Äôt named and everything is on a schedule. They aren‚Äôt mistreated. Many of these places can afford regular vets that cycle threw. Daily care routines. But what can happen is workers being untrained due to no animal understanding. Accidents. And a video taken then can appear it‚Äôs terrible abuse when it‚Äôs a one time thing. 
Ethics are different for each person. Knowing what is abuse. Knowing what is not. That is a huge deal. A untrained person will always jump to say abuse when a professional can say otherwise.  Don‚Äôt forget. Most people get the deepily edited version from online. And you know what they say. Believe none of what you hear and half of what you see."
2299,2020-10-25 18:10:07,jhxf5c,"The way I justify adding the animal foods into my diet is 1-I physically cannot be vegan- some people might be able to because their body can convert vitamins better than mine but I cannot. If I am not healthy then I can‚Äôt do other things to work toward my own sustainability goals and help others. This doesn‚Äôt sound like it applies to you but it does to me. 
2-I don‚Äôt eat livestock that is grain-fed. As you pointed out- feeding animals (who don‚Äôt even naturally eat grain wtf) a monocropped grain diet is a huge factor in climate change. Easy peesy- I swapped out my expensive supplements for expensive meat that is 100% grass fed and finished. Obviously not everyone can afford grass fed but imo if they can afford to be a healthy vegan then they can afford grass fed.
3- Plant based foods have to be shipped all around the world and beyond that aren‚Äôt necessarily eco-friendly to produce. just look at the amount of processing and shipping that goes into meat-substitute foods. I have driven through the almond farms in Southern California and seen how unnatural that is. They grow those almonds in the middle of a desert and that‚Äôs supposed to be more eco-friendly than me finding a local goat farm for my milk. Avocados, almonds, palm oil, and yes grains are some of the worst things for the environment because of the common farming practices. And unless you live on the equator your food HAS to be shipped. No good. 
So I try to focus on local. Local grass fed. Not everyone can afford to do this but I can right now so that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing. 
I‚Äôm a big believer in everyone has their own things that they can do and there isn‚Äôt a one size fits all solution for health or eco-consciencness. I feel like it starts to get way too dogmatic if we start saying ‚Äúthis is what everyone has to do and if you don‚Äôt do it you‚Äôre a bad person‚Äù my body needs meat, and I can ethically source, so that‚Äôs what I do."
2300,2020-10-25 20:35:19,jhxf5c,"Gonna respond to the farming section.

> but even putting aside new technologies like vertical farming that will most likely change the way things are done

Those technologies aren't there yet and can't feed many people. Let's stay in the present.

> then a vegan diet is still the most ethical thing to do because the majority of worldwide crops and land is now used for feeding livestock (particularly soy which is the stick used to beat vegans with)

This argument works only for grain fed animal products. For hunted and grass fed animals it doesn't work. There is ZERO evidence that veganism kills fewer animals compared to hunting or grass fed / free range farming (feel free to prove me wrong if you can)"
2301,2020-10-26 02:25:48,jhxf5c,"Quite simple

If humans are morally equal to animals, then we have as much right as any animal to slaughter another for food.

If humans are not morally equal to animals, then there is no objection to killing them for food.

If I could get B12, DHA, EPA, Carnitine, Creatine, D3, K2, heme iron, Zinc, etc. from Dortitos and Coca-Cola, I would."
2303,2020-10-25 20:15:55,jhxf5c,"Well, I can't offer to be a person who was once vegan and then changed, as I was never vegan. However, if you're looking for someone who understands veganism and can have a good-faith conversation, I can do so.

One thing that strikes me about your position is that you seem to claim that veganism is the opposition to animal suffering, torture, etc. Yet, so is welfarism as a non-vegan. You'd be right to claim that welfarism is not against the death of animals, but let's not act like veganism is the only response to bad animal conditions.

In fact, if we talk in terms of pains/pleasures *during* an animal life, it becomes plausible to talk about animal agriculture as an *improvement* to wild animal living. If you're coming from a deontological rights-based position that declares animals have the right to life, this might not appeal to you. But if your intuitions are more utilitarian, it might.

And again, when you talk about farming and monocropping, you seem to think that veganism is the best option because much monocropping is used to feed animals. Again, that's not necessary. Some land is best for grazing. Many animals are fed aspects of vegetables that humans *can't* eat but other animals can, like corn husks.

You seem to brush aside arguments about spraying pesticides, using the age-old ""That's a gotcha, vegans aren't perfect"" defense. The reason that objection, and similar one's come up, is because it's hard to understand *what veganism is* at times. Do you understand what principles you operate under in order to say that spraying and killing animals is acceptable? I'm not saying you can't make it work, that you can't have some sort of reasoning, but do you? Why can humans expand onto natural land, cutting down trees/homes of animals? Why can we pollute nature, killing animals indirectly? It's one thing to say ""I live by principle X, but it's hard to live by principle X perfectly"" vs. ""I don't eat meat, but I don't even understand what principle I live by which says I shouldn't.""

In the end, though, I'm not going to offer you an argument *against* veganism. I'm not *against* vegans, they are against me for not being vegan. However, if you're looking for an out, why don't you try debating me and see if you can make your own case stick."
2304,2020-10-25 20:32:58,jhxf5c,"Veganism is bad for human health, bad for animal welfare and bad for the environment.

I know that this is exactly opposite to the mainstream narrative, but it is true.


**Human Health:**

Over several million years, [we left our leaf eating primate cousins behind](https://youtu.be/b1C5wW7hePs) and adapted to eating a primarily meat and animal fat based diet. Even if we wanted to, we no longer possess the digestive plumbing to extract essential nutrition from plants. You can learn more by researching the [Expensive Tissue Hypothesis](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Expensive+Tissue+Hypothesis). This is not reversible without serious ramifications. The fossil record shows that we actually got shorter and our brains got smaller, when we started eating plants regularly, at the dawn of agriculture.


**Animal Welfare:**

Plant farmers, even organically certified plant farmers, kill untold hordes of sentient animals to sow, irrigate, protect and harvest their crop. This is not a secret yet somehow the vegan community seems to be blissfully unaware. The deaths per pound of essential digestible protein, of any plant food vs. grass fed beef, simply do not compare. Further, the animals that die due to plant agriculture truly suffer. They are terrified, suffocated, burned alive, poisoned, chopped up. Sentient animals! It's not a pleasant experience for them.

**The Environment:**

Climate change and ecological damage began when humans first started to clear land for their fields, tilled that land, exposing the soil's carbon to the air and irrigated the land with water diverted from ancient ecosystems that depended on it. All this had the added benefit of promoting topsoil runoff, destroying even more aquatic ecosystems, all over the world. Topsoil used to be measured in 10s of feet. Now it's measured in inches.

Sociologically speaking, this was also the beginning of large scale, organized war, to acquire fertile farm lands, and organized human slavery, to work the fields through forced manual labour.

The stats that say plants are being grown to feed cattle are intentionally misleading. We feed cattle the parts of the plant we do not eat, which is most of the plant. When was the last time you ate a corn stalk?

We grow corn, soy and other grains, process them for oil, ethanol (another huge scam) and other compounds, compact the stalks, stems and husks into ""cakes"", then feed them to cows. If we didn't feed these plant by-products to cows, they would just pile up, decompose and release greenhouse gases. The miracle of cows is that they can convert these otherwise indigestible discards into high quality protein, for us to consume. 

But the only reason this is affordable is because of enormous US government subsidies that go toward grain production.

These subsidies have resulted in a massive oversupply, driving the market price of grains lower than the actual cost to produce them. Small local farmers, around the world, cannot compete with our price and are driven out of business, which worsens global poverty.

We use nitrogen, extracted from coal and fossil fuel, and minerals, derived from fossil fuel powered rock crushers, to fertilize the land, just to grow mountains of government subsidized grain.

We don't need to do this. Cows can eat grass. Cows prefer to eat grass. If you feed grain to a cow for more than a few months, it will get sick and will eventually die.

It's not healthy for us to eat grains either. We know that feeding grains to cows causes them to fatten up quickly and get sick. But somehow the experts tell us they are good for us? The logic just does not parse.

Plant and especially grain agriculture is flat out unsustainable. Even with hydroponics. The fossil fuel will run out.

**How we reverse this looming environmental disaster:**

The only method we have to rapidly sequester carbon and restore the soil is [regenerative ranching](https://savory.global/) of grass fed/finished ruminant animals. Regenerative ranching is the only form of agriculture that has been proven to be a [net carbon sink](https://blog.whiteoakpastures.com/hubfs/WOP-LCA-Quantis-2019.pdf). No form of plant agriculture can claim this.

2305,2020-10-25 22:14:55,jhxf5c,"**Health** \- it is clear that the vegan diet is better than the SAD for health outcomes like longevity for those who can sustain it. The issue is sustainability (is it really possible that all ex-vegans did it wrong?) and that studies on vegan diets do not account for attrition - if you aren't vegan by the end of the follow up of the study, you won't figure in it.

Is it not sustainable for you? Did you start having health issues on your diet? If no, then there is no health argument for why you'd start eating meat.

**Animals are not our equals** \- They are not, we agree.

*but if they are better than a brick then it seems the least we can do is not torture*

They do not need to be tortured, you can procure meat from places that look after animals - and usually the bigger the animal, the bigger investment, so lower chance it is going to be mistreated, but if you want to be 100% sure, find a farmer, ask them to walk you around, and get your meat from the farmer that has good standards instead of supermarket factory operation.

*and kill for our sadistic pleasure.*

That is a very reductionist point of view. As long as you buy supermarket vegetables, your diet kills a lot of smaller animals anyway. In fact, a totally grass-fed beef can result in lower death per calorie than supermarket vegetable and grain produce. Discrepancy becomes hilarious if you count insects as animal death. If you became vegan because you wanted to save the animals, getting your calories from the biggest animal you can find, that has a good standard of living, and is mostly pasture raised, will save more animals.

**Farming**

*but even putting aside new technologies like vertical farming*

I started a thread in vegan debate sub and out of maybe 15+ people who replied, only 1 guy was engaged in producing some of his own food, and nobody supported veganic farming or vertical farming. Nobody. It is not going to just pop into existence without support.

*because the majority of worldwide crops and land is now used for feeding livestock*

There's nothing stopping you from procuring meat from animals that aren't fed grains and other monocrops.

*If it were redirected straight to humans instead of overbreeding livestock and trying to fatten them up it could feed millions of people that are going hungry right now*

Majority of crops that animals get are inedible parts left over from production of crops for other purposes. Imagine a corn plant: how much of it is human edible? 10% of the weight? Less? You can't eat the stalks and the leaves - the farm animals get the rest. All the statistics dealing with habitat destruction/emissions from crop farming etc, are based on the distribution of crops between humans and animals sorted by weight. They aren't stealing our food.

People who are hungry usually live in areas where crop farming is very restricted due to elements like droughts. In fact, livestock husbandry is essential for their food security. Problem is with distribution, always has been.

**Evolution** \- I won't comment on this since that would be just an appeal to nature and I'm not in disagreement.

**Natural order/circle of life**

*(humans are the only species that drink milk after babyhood and the only species to drink the milk of other animals) can be considered ""the natural order"".*

Humans are the only species that uses internet. This is just appealing to tradition.

But for fun, I'll also point out that what you said isn't technically accurate if you want to use this fallacy. Ants ""milk"" aphids, so we are not the only species to figure it out.

**""Ah but you do THIS""**

I'll do one better. You already aren't consistent with not supporting exploitation of animals. Humans are animals. Anytime you buy something online or from a shop, you are exploiting work of someone else. From sweatshop worker in 3rd word country that makes your clothes and assembles accessories you use everyday, child slaves in Congo mining cobalt for your electronics and car parts, migrant fruit/vegetable pickers that are working in conditions that are against the law and paid under minimum wages, to finally the usual worker drone that puts in backbreaking physical labor in to get a miniscule share of the profit pie, while fat company owner sits on his ass and collects the dollars and whom you ultimately pay for a coffee in a diner.

You may say that it isn't reasonable not to have electronics in 2020. Why not? Why default to futility? Why can't you buy them all second or third hand or live with Nokia 3310? Why not buy clothes and other appliances exclusively from fair trade companies, and make sure they are truly fair trade? Why engage in exploitative consumerism on a daily basis and not try to minimize the exploitation of human beings? Why not become as self-sufficient as you can, instead of participating in the rat race that will end in your death anyway?

Truth is, you are fine with exploitation of others if it means comfort, pleasure and monetary savings. Just like a meat eater.

\-

We live in a natural system with the animals that are living on our farms, we are their environment. People who eat meat are a part of the ecosystem that is benefiting both humans and the animals.

We give them food, shelter, medical attention and reproductive capabilities such that we guarantee survival of these animals. You can be for better animal welfare and actively contribute to that without wiping out the farming industry and with it these animals that have been our companions for thousands of years and who rely on the farming industry to keep on existing. A life of a farm animal, especially on a decent farm, is a life that is worth living. There is no reason to utterly annihilate these animals because of how they live, which will eventually happen if the world goes vegan.

End of the day, it's your decision. The flat world will keep on rolling and people will keep on falling off the edges of square Earth."
2306,2020-10-25 21:00:56,jhxf5c,"I cannot be vegan. I easily adopted the diet because I was never much of a meat eater. I love eating plants, and have no problem adjusting my eating. I have major damage from endometriosis in my digestive and reproductive system. (I went to the doctor over and over, they refused to check for endometriosis.)I was told it would help if I went vegan. Within three months, I had high levels of good cholesterol, as well as pancreatitis. Every vegan I talked to basically have told me it was not the diet or I did it wrong. I have a vegan doctor cousin, and consulted with him about diet. I was also taking supplements for every possible mineral. 

I tried keto and it is the only diet that actually worked! For the first time in ten years I was able to work, and have a life. If I go off it, I end up with low grade fevers, stomach pain, horrible and painful bowel movements. I really cannot be off meat.

I totally disagree about cult like vegans. I have gotten death threats for owning hybrid cats from vegans. I have been told that the vegan diet did not cause my issues, been called nasty names because I consume raw milk. I had two ARA/vegans say I should send my savannah cross to a sanctuary that was seriously abused by her previous owners and scared of her own shadow. How is that compassion? Abandon a abused pet because they do not believe people should own hybrid cats?! 

I have been told by vegans/ARAs they hope I die, my family, my parents, and even my kids! One even said that she hopes my son, whom was 4 in my profile picture, dies a slow and painful death. Vegans have come to groups that are anti vegan or ARA and told me off because I believed differently than them.

I also think it is wrong of vegans/ARAs to let animals lose to die of being run over by cars in fur farms. It is also wrong to trespass on people's private land to rescue animals/film/ or whatever else they do. 

Also, blocking trucks heading towards slaughter houses is wrong. The animals are already upset, and you are prolonging their terror. By all means, protest in front of the slaughter house, but let people do their jobs! 

As someone that was raped, and experienced domestic violence, comparing these to animals is sickening! Using the Holocaust, and other horrific events in history is gross and wrong. By doing so, you are minimizing the suffering of those people. As animals go into heat on instinct, and as a cat owner that has had cats' howl and cry and will mate with any tom cat around. Many animals are the same way. Now a human sexually assaulting an animal is wrong, as they cannot consent, and that is just beyond gross.  It has caused the begining of nasty sexual diseases, such as HIV.

Animals used as a food source should be treated better, and I support laws and regulations that make their lives better. In a perfect world, things would be better. But AR laws you support have actually caused more suffering. Such as horses, an unwanted/old/lame horse was sent to a local slaughter house, the owner could watch to make sure the animal did not suffer. Now, unwanted horses are shipped off to Mexico, in which the horses are starved and have low standards, on top of a long drive for days and even weeks. The other option is Canadian slaughter house, many are shipped off to Japan as horse sushi is all the rage! People are losing their exotic pets and used as props for donations for places like Big Cat Rescue, which, most is not actually used for their care. When the money runs dry, the animal is euthanized. (I am friend's with someone that bitch Baskin did it too. )Your AR groups, such as ALDF tried to have hybrid cats made illegal to own. They are so ""compassionate"" they did not include young generations, which I had. I would of had to euthanize her, as she was a shy bengal. Real love of animals there! If yoy actually learn about exotic animals, many of the sanctuaries do not even take decent care of them. As the AR/vegan agenda is more important. There has been many good ethical breeders targeted by retail rescues for their expensive animals. AR groups have destroyed people's lives with false claims. Even after proven false, their animals often receive poor care in shelters or rescues. How are retail rescues any different than breeders in their greed? 

ALDF is a joke. Do you know they ignored an abusive shelter manger 20 minutes from their lavish offices? The bitch killed a horse, starved animals, illegally killed an entire cat room, was abusive to staff and the public? But they still have articles about a big cat that died two years ago?

Also, veganism ARA is very well funded. As many vegans want meat to be highly taxed, thus forcing the poor to go without a cheap protein. I was a single mom on food stamps, and could not afford the never ending cost of supplement. Meat, such as chicken, was a major staple. All over taxing meat would do is the poor being malnourished. How is that compassion?

As laws of hunting has gotten more strict, deers are left to starve to death during winter. A friend of mine fed a group that was starving because there are to many of them. 

In farming, rats, bears, foxes, under ground mammals, birds, ect. are killed. You are glossing over the natural habitat destroyed and animals killed. As veganism becomes more popular, third world countries are being stripped for these fruits, young children are used as labor. You also do not mention the pollution shipping on barges causes. Have you ever been to any port and look at the water? 

Buying locally organic produce and meat is much more environmentally friendly than veganism. It also helps the local economy and not child labor. 

As for health, all I have to do is see the deterioration of my vegan cousin. He looks like crap, and his brother, five years older looks much better.  He used to be caring and loving towards people, not just animals. Vegans seems to be more sickly, to thin, have mental as well as cognitive issues. Many become fanatical in their beliefs. Children that are forced to be vegan do not develop normally. As far as I am concerned, it is child abuse. I also have my own experience, as well as well of many other vegans. It always seem funny how ex vegans become the biggest haters of veganism. That says it all.."
2307,2020-10-26 05:51:07,jhxf5c,"You may be disappointed with my response considering you wrote an entire essay and were hoping for a genuine counterpoint, but my response is:

\> How can you refute the points I have made so far?

I DONT HAVE TO.

That's it, that's the response, you literally don't have to. short sweet to the point

no where does it say u need to justify any part of your diet. u don't need to prove anything to anyone. And if someone says you're making excuses? Well their words can fall flat because if u feel u have nothing to excuse, there are no excuses to even be made.

As for a substantial answer, I'm afraid I don't have one. All I can say in that regard is look to anecdotal evidence; despite what u may have heard, it's not disposable just because it isn't a number statistic.

PS - to whom are you trying to justify this? Jerks on the internet? I guarantee u only a fraction of people will have the audacity to say whatever was said on the internet to u IRL"
2308,2020-10-25 21:03:27,jhxf5c,I don't have much to contribute to the discussion. I just want to say that I wish there were more vegans like you.
2309,2020-10-25 22:51:42,jhxf5c,"This might end up equally long, apologies in advance.

I've tried to do veganism several times throughout my life.

The very First time I lived with my parents and it became a battle against them because everything wasnt vegan because of this or that. I ended up eating (and being fed) nothing but plain tofu and iceberg lettuce salad For almost a month before I got so tired of plain tofu and plain salad that I just went back to the diet my parents made. (I was probably 11. So no I could not just get a job and earn my own money.)

For most people that would probably be enough to full stop and never try again ever.
I tried again four times after moving out on my own.
First time, couldnt budget it well enough and survive on my own, I was not going to move back in with my parents just to stay vegan.
Second time got sick, wasnt able to afford sticking with it.
Third time, knew a lot more had a friend who'd been vegan a long time helping me out. Got sick again, started wondering if this was a pattern.
Last time was vegan got incredibly sick to the point I was almost hospitalized. Went off veganism, got better I wont be doing so again. My health is important and I cant put my immediate loved ones through that again.
As to ethical and morality of it, I originally tried veganism because I thought I was doing better for the world, but then when I started doing research into it found that often wasnt true. (Labour, waste, oil use, ecological impacts)

 I want to put out that For me If I eat meat/animal material my body absorbs certain vitamins and minerals better than If I did just plant material and vitamin supplements.  With that said This isnt true for everyone, some people do much better being vegan. I have a cousin who lives perfectly healthy and fine as vegan, has since he was 5, he is almost 20 now. (as does the friend who helped me out, mentioned earlier, has been vegan most their life) I wont look down on those who do better health wise being vegan or even choose to be so for their own ethics and moral reasons, I only ask the same of others when it comes to me not being so.

 In addition to healthwise, in the day to day I would have to eat a ton more plant material to get the same amount of nutrition. That means there would need to be that much more farmland, chemical treatments (if using the current agriculture methods), equipment and manual labor (and that more often than not is an unethical mess all its own). Not to mention plastic/packaging, shipping and other things not mentioned.

If I find a farmer who raises a meat product in a good way I will buy a share from them and have a fairly decent amount of necessary (and easier to process on the body for me) nutrition that i need to eat less of. (Plus I help a small/local bussiness and can often get stuff in paper packaging rather than plastic or even bring my own containers to be filled)

We are trying to grow at least 50% of the food my family consumes on our own over the last few years (with Hope's to going to 80-90% someday). Not as easy as large scale farmers and long time gardeners make it look. But we are also raising our own meat and processing as well. It helps us know what we are eating and knowing they are given the absolute best until it's time to eat them (we dispatch as fast as possible). We waste very little of either plant or animal because we know the work and life that went into our meals.
 In addition  to our garden We currently raise chickens, they get our kitchen, garden scraps as well as a big coop and time to wander the yard. We provide enrichment stuff (tiles we flips for bugs, hanging baskets with greens, lettuces and stuff to jump and peck at, a small pond to cool off/float and play in). We get eggs and meat from them, as well as compost and garden enrichment. 

Alternatively I think of it as how much can I use from them while being as least wasteful as possible?  Which hopefully will make sense as I try to explain....

One whole processed chicken I can make multiple meals from and with (at least 5 meals for 3 people), as well while they are laying I get from 1 hen an egg almost every day.
Think of it as separate for each, chicken breast, wings/legs, picked off meat from the rest, bones/feet for broth, gizzards/neck for gravies.  I can wash/dry/bake/breakdown the eggshell and feed them back to the chickens or capsule them and use myself for calcium. The used up bones can further be ground and used for garden enrichment and the feathers given a wash/freezer treatment and used for feather downs/pillow (I sew quilts/pillows from secondhand stuff as gifts) or used as garden compost enrichment again.


A single head of broccoli, some peppers and 2 cups of raw rice make 1 meal for 3 at most.  (For each person, 1 c cooked rice, seasoned with strips of peppers and mayby a cup of chopped broccoli mixed and pan fried)

That broccoli needs 2 ft in every direction and most farmings grow and cut once, the rest is often wasted (you can eat just about every part of a broccoli plant btw~ And they will often grow smaller heads a second time if allowed to, for those trying out gardening)   I cant grow rice, so I have to buy it regardless. (How much gas/labour/plastic went into it) the peppers are a pick and grow again, most big farms have labourers handpick them (in many areas for as little as 75 cent a day and in parts of the world employ and pay kids even less) and then are packaged in plastic/shipped/I drive to get them/etc.

So for me aside from my health there was still a moral reasoning I went away from veganism. The ecological and social impact just wasnt good. 
We rarely eat out (probably at most once a month) for the reasoning you mentioned, we cant verify the what, when, where and why's of where the food stuff comes from.   I dont know if it's been mentioned by someone else but the soy most often fed to animals is the stalks, not the beans and last I checked people cant eat anything but the beans off soy plants. Same as a lot of corn products, yes corn itself is fed to livestock often but more often a lot of cornstalk/leaves and husks get fed to livestock because humans just cant process those items 

I may have got off track a bit, but hope that I might have contributed in a beneficial manner"
2310,2020-10-25 20:09:09,jhxf5c,"This was too long to read so i will answer the title and what first paragraphs that were conflicting and confusing.

What do you mean by 'like'?

This is about your life style and diet which affects your health and well being. You are making it sound like a simple matter of eating an apple or an orange.

There is nothing more valuable to a person than their health so you gotta take this seriously from early age and especially once you get older.

You are saying that ""There is no moral justification not to be vegan""

Why do you think that we are obliged or entitled to justify norms and social behaviors? The one who demand the change have the burden of proof that their change is positive.

In this case, vegans need to justify not consuming and utilizing animals. Their justification so far was ""It's unnecessary and cruel"". Which have 2 problems. First of all, this is an appeal to emotions fallacy. Just because you personally think something is cruel, doesn't mean that it's wrong and everyone should feel the same. The second issue is that, it's unnecessary and cruel from their prespective. 

I can give justifications for the sake of argument even if i am not obliged to such as vegan diet being inherently unhealthy and lacking in essential nutritions that can be only supplemented or received from fortified food and there is a research that suggests those supplements are inferior to whole foods and not well tested. 

Also, all scientific health organization declared meat as healthy and full of nutrients. They only recommended lowering red processed meat and and at the same time highly recommend adding fish 1-2 times a week.

Finally, there is no objective value of leaving animals to die of natural causes or killed and eaten alive by other animals over us utilizing them.

Vegan diet is not even well tested. Most vegans were not vegans from birth and on consequent generations. We still don't know the full effect of vegansim on us physically and mentally."
2311,2020-10-25 20:57:44,jhxf5c,"Since you want people to read your ‚Äúlong post‚Äù, make sure to check out r/antivegan ‚Äòs wiki and the wiki for this group. Plenty of arguments against veganism from every angle. 

To start, there are some things that you ‚Äúknow‚Äù that are vegan distortions. 

>‚ÄùHere's what I do know - the fact that Lionel Messi, Novak Djokovic, Serena Williams, Tom Brady and others - legendary sportspeople at the very top of their game at an age when most of their peers have declined, are on a vegan/plant-based diet means that unless you think they are lying about things, any discussion that it's not possible to have a healthy vegan diet can be put to bed straight away.‚Äù

They aren‚Äôt vegan. A few of them have even straightforwardly distanced themselves from veganism, describing it as nutritionally incomplete for their personal needs. 

Also, it shouldn‚Äôt go without note that you dismiss all studies on the matter because they ‚Äúcontradicted‚Äù each other and confused you. This is an unacceptable neglect of your own critical thinking skills.

>‚ÄùAnimals are not our equals""** \ Without getting into crass comparisons to historical human slavery that I've seen other vegans do, you don't need to see animals as ""equals"" to have a sense of compassion.‚Äù

Well, we need animals for our health. Or as you see it, you -don‚Äôt know- but believe we ‚Äúdon‚Äôt‚Äù based on observations of athletes that are actually omnivores and unwilling to go vegan ever again? Seems like this second argument doesn‚Äôt have a great foundation. Animals don‚Äôt have to be our equals to get better treatment even though we consume them however, I agree with you on that. 

Be sure to read in the wiki about how animals die in crops. Someone on the ‚Äúcarnivore diet‚Äù could easily kill less animals than a vegan. In absolute numbers. 

>‚Äùa vegan diet is still the most ethical thing to do because the majority of worldwide crops and land is now used for feeding livestock (particularly soy which is the stick used to beat vegans with).‚Äù

Again see the wiki. 

Also, the feed that goes to livestock is largely inedible, the estimate is wrong anyway, and the rest of these crops meet a lot of demand for processed junk and oils that are making the masses chronically ill. The synthetic fertilizers that go into this system kill animals, the soil, and humans. 

>‚ÄùI don't like having to eat excess amounts of legumes and nuts to balance my diet but it seems preferable to the suffering caused.‚Äù

Good lord. Do you think food is just a passive process? How many people do you believe might actually survive and thrive grazing on ungodly quantities of carbohydrates, fiber, and nuts just to meet an experimentally limited version of their nutrient needs? Please, please read the health wiki in this group and r/antivegan. But I digress. 

>‚ÄùBut then something else happened - my partner who moved in with me a year ago, also became vegan. The difference between us - I am a massive foodie and eat everything, she was fussy even before she started trying it, and absolutely won't eat chickpeas, lentils, tofu or any of the other things that vegans typically use for protein. Without going into too much detail, she then ended up having some health complications and is now supplementing with protein shakes, tablets etc. Even though I have personally been perfectly healthy this entire time, seeing all of that just got me thinking again. Is this really how we're supposed to live? With processed powders and crops imported from all over the world?‚Äù

No 

>‚ÄùWhy did you, knowing what it takes to get animal products onto your plate, change your mind on the ethical side? How can you refute the points I have made so far?‚Äù

The vegan diet doesn‚Äôt have many nutrients. Even if some of these (creatine, DHA, etc) can be lab synthesized, taking 1 highly processed supplement a day has serious health risks and potential long term effects, not to mention the idea of taking a dozen. Isolated supplements also have risks/ reduced and variable availability. 

You envision a world where everyone eats masses of carbofiber, seed oils, lab synthesized proteins, and isolated synthetic vitamins until their digestive tracts have been degraded and scraped to bits by the sheer volume of bulls**t. 

The science is in. We see it in the kids first and foremost: vegan pregnancies result in smaller babies, vegan children are smaller and sicker, babies who aren‚Äôt fed meat while weaning have iron and zinc deficiencies. Low cholesterol is related to diet and causes mental illness, depression, anxiety, and violence. Going plant based increases bone turnover. 

It‚Äôs time for fewer ‚Äúconversations‚Äù, look into it and do your own critical thinking. Good luck."
2312,2020-10-25 20:58:14,jhxf5c,"I love your post! You pointed out everything that's easy to see as foolish when you leave the vegan cult (It is a cult.) Caring so deeply about this is a good sign you will be quitting soon, and I hope you do! ‚ù§ Also, you will be greeted with open arms here, but imagine sharing your experience on the vegan corners of the internet!! ü§Ø 

""Carnists"" is a word that only vegans use, while the rest of us laugh. 
Comparing factory farming and non-veganism in general to homophobia, sexism, slavery, etc. is ridiculous and insulting to those social issues. 
Factory farming is gross and small family farms are perfect. (I buy all the cheap stuff unapologetically. It's affordable due to government subsidies, and I'm broke. Am I a bad, immoral person for doing so? No, and anyone who claims other wise can learn to target the correct culprits (big ag, corporations, inhumane low wages + expensive cost of living, etc.)) 
Truly disliking your lifestyle and diet is a reason to discontinue!
Acknowledging that ex vegans are sensative to the issues is very nice and very true, but to assume the switch needs to be ""justified"" is just the veganism talking, and not you. 
It's not ""We have always eaten meat + animal products, therefore we must continue."" Instead, its ""We eat animal products because we NEED to."" Fat, cholesterol, vitamin B12, etc. are vital, and supplementation is NOT comparable to eating food. (Vegan Gains is a good example of Vitamin B12 supplementation clearly not working.)
The processed plant based mock meat industry is a depressing money grab. To think that part of ""ethical"" veganism is caring for the environment and then to be met with something like Beyond Meat?? So unnatural, unhealthy, expensive, and BAD for the environment. Even something more ""natural"" like tofu is not helpful, either.
Willful ignorance is required to be a vegan longterm. Don't wait for your mental and physical health to deteriorate.

Anecdotal experiences like our's DO matter, especially when they all sound either eerily similar to each other! Look at yourself in the mirror now, then find a pic in the beginning of veganism, then find a pic prior to veganism. Also, look at Dr. Gregor, McDougall, etc. and REALLY ask yourself if they look healthy. No need to watch VD or Vegan Phobic - just look at them and listen to them talk for real! Best of luck‚ù§"
2313,2020-10-26 04:23:56,jhxf5c,That was a very interesting read. Hope somebody has an input on this. Following.
2314,2020-10-26 11:57:59,jhxf5c,"Latecomer here, sorry if I repeat anything others have said.  See this article for an alternative point of view regarding vegan athletes: [https://daveasprey.com/carl-lewis-vegan/](https://daveasprey.com/carl-lewis-vegan/)

and this post from Denise Minger about why some people may react poorly to a vegan diet [https://deniseminger.com/2016/10/20/why-do-some-people-do-well-as-vegans-and-vegetarians-clues-from-the-magical-world-of-genetics/](https://deniseminger.com/2016/10/20/why-do-some-people-do-well-as-vegans-and-vegetarians-clues-from-the-magical-world-of-genetics/)

Also, though I admire your questioning stance, I am calling you out on double standards regarding 'mistakes'.  So if a vegan travels on leather seats or has a dessert with dairy you are complaining that omnis will judge them harshly, but if an ethical omnivore makes what they think is the best decision in social eating situation you are okay with making your own harsh judgement?

And another thing, have you read any stories about people who gave veganism their very best, most thoughtful shot, and lost their health?  There are plenty on here, (or see Megan Remedy on YouTube) and your first point about sports people shows that you don't believe anyone can do veganism properly and fail to thrive.  Either you haven‚Äôt read any such accounts, or you don't believe they did it properly, which is very, very disrespectful.

Actually, your language shows that you have no doubt that the vegan diet is adequate for anyone, and reveals that you are commenting from a deep vegan perspective, for example:

'we all have a moral obligation not to abuse animals just for our own pleasure.'

That sentence comes with the inherent assumptions that 1) we are all fine without animal foods and our physical enjoyment of animal foods is some kind of pointless carnal thing, not our bodies saying yes to something which nourishes us, and 2) that all animal farming or hunting is abuse.  I think you are currently as incapable of an impartial perspective as anyone you have complained about.

Finally, some arguments for eating meat:

In the wild, nothing dies of old age.  Many animals are ripped apart and eaten warm by predators.  Eat game (not the nicest term for it, I know) if you want to avoid farming. 

Transport is the biggest driver of climate change.  Eat local as far as possible, including ethically raised meat and wild fish."
2315,2020-10-25 21:23:31,jhxf5c,"I was considering vegetarianism, and my friend just said what about plants.  What if they have a consciousness that equal but different than our own, or some species of plants.  Well you got to eat something, and it seems assumptive to imagine they don't have some different type of consciousness."
2316,2020-10-25 21:38:59,jhxf5c,"I need animal products to thrive, and I see absolutely no moral issue with eating them. No gotcha's here. Just my informed perspective. I believe that all animals, plants, and beings are our equals. What goes along with this, is that I believe that I am a part of the cycles of life. There is no way for me to not participate in killing other beings while still living myself. Whether it be bacteria, plants, animals...they all have the same right to be alive as I do. I don't find this selfish, I find it realistic. I want to live, and life must consume life to live. Again... This is true for plants, animals, bacteria...it's true for all. I feel that veganism is a perspective that takes the idea of doing no harm to the level of harming oneself. It is not selfish to eat the things your body needs to thrive. And yes, most people DO need animal products to THRIVE (not just survive)...Though perhaps some can do without. 

 I do believe though, that it's not okay (for me) to eat unethically raised animal products if I can afford to buy from places that understand animal husbandry and allow the animals a relatively natural life before they become food. So I choose to support those practices (which makes them able to spread and eventually to become affordable for everyone...I hope). I am against factory farming for animal husbandry, health, and environmental reasons...and yet I still understand that for some that's the only meat/egg/milk they have access to and I am not so blind to my own privilege as to say that I know how to resolve that.

&#x200B;

On another note, humans can drink raw milk (and ideally would drink that over pasteurized milk)...there are plenty of cultures that have been doing this as a part of their ancestral foodways for many generations...but because of the horrible conditions of most factory farms, over time there started to be regulations about pasteurizing milk.

&#x200B;

Another...much of the land used for livestock is non arable land (cannot be farmed on). So the propaganda about livestock taking up land that could be used for farming is based on a misunderstanding of the resources available on earth. Related to this---as someone who grew up around many people who raised their own animals to eat, I know the difference between good and poor animal husbandry, so I don't presume to say that ALL ways of raising animals for eating are unethical and so must be stopped. This is just not true at all and every time a vegan says this it makes it clear that they are uninformed. There are healthy and ethical ways to love the animals that are literally giving their lives for you. 

&#x200B;

Frankly, I do not believe we can take supplements etc that are the same as eating what our bodies have evolved to eat over millennia. To believe that would be to assume that humans understand the complexities of nutrients and nutrition, when the reality is that we truly do not! Truly. In the same way that we don't understand the complexity of the soil biome and so we cannot reproduce that by growing in water + nutrients."
2317,2020-10-25 20:42:29,jhxf5c,"Hunt your animal food. There is no better ethical argument than to harvest an animal from nature that has lived its entire life as it naturally should and for which the only alternative of death is being viciously eaten alive by a predator or slowly succumbing to disease and exposure. 

I know hunting is a very contentious point and is generally demonized but if you got to know those within the hunting community, you'd find that many of them are as ethical as they come, focusing most of their attention on developing the skills to make a clean shot and to ensure a quick and merciful death. 

With some research, you'd also find that permits and fees for hunting go directly back into funding conservation and sustainability to ensure the ecosystem is healthy and in balance so that the practice of hunting can continue. 

Obviously this is not an option for everyone. If it isn't for you, I'm sorry to say I can't objectively come up with any better moral argument.

Finally, I know you didn't want any contention on this point as I'm sure you've heard it before but I feel inclined to at least point out, at the risk of becoming too philosophical, that we live in an imperfect world of suffering and exploitation. The shoes on your feet, the clothes on your back, and the phone you carry in your pocket is all produced by exploiting underprivileged people, often children, in third world countries. You shouldn't feel guilty about being born privileged but you should instead feel blessed and practice gratitude. The only somewhat feasible way to totally exclude yourself from contributing to the suffering in the world is to go the way of the Buddhist monk and give up all your worldly possessions to live a life of extreme asceticism."

But one concept i only recently stumbled across is the 'Logic of the larder' argument.

It requires you to also have a utilitarian, consequentialist starting point but poses an interesting challenge to veganism I haven't yet fully refuted. Its basically a moral case for eating animals"
2321,2020-10-26 12:48:10,jhxf5c,It‚Äôs because you don‚Äôt know how food is made and how many deaths are really on your plate compared to a properly raised ruminant. Ask a farmer about plant agriculture and then ask another regenerative animal farmer about death.

I think one of the most improtant things that goes along with a vegan diet is how to make it sustainable for yourself. Yes some vegans eat avocados, some drink almond milk ect. Personally i try to avoid these things, im not big into food and although some people might say what i do is not austainable, i get most of my iron, b12 and vitamin d from supliments.
What ever you need to do to make your diet sustainable, which means it needs to be enjoyable to you, do it. If that means your vegan 99% of the time but eat eggs or fish now and again, thats ok.

The aim of veganism is not to be perfect. But to reduce suffering as much as one can within their means. Please just dont be one of those people who throw their morals away the second they taste meat.  You can still help alot by not being perfect."

Being vegan is also a major social barrier in our current society, and while I suppose it would be different if we hadn‚Äôt industrialized agriculture in such a deformed way‚Äîthe truth, like you know, is that it still sucks to be vegan. And given that it‚Äôs such a challenge, it‚Äôs more likely to only be taken up by people who can afford to do so; in other words, people of privilege (like myself, and dare I say, you too, OP)."
2326,2020-10-25 18:55:10,jhxf5c,"There's really no moral argument against veganism apart from apathy (or pretending to be apathetic). If you empathize with other animals then it can't really be justified from a moral standpoint to eat them.

If there was a moral argument against veganism, then I bet most vegans would eat meat. Most vegans love the taste of meat. The whole reason they don't eat meat is because there is no moral justification to do so. Let's face it, in many ways being vegan sucks.

The only way to justify eating animal products (assuming you are not apathetic) is from another angle such as health. If your health requires animal products, then you have a decision between saving yourself or saving other animals. Most sane people will choose to save themselves.

You can also rationalize it from a convenience standpoint. Vegans do this anyway in certain situations. If an option is too inconvenient, you may not be able to morally justify it but you can rationalize that it's the most practical option. For example, you could claim that eating processed vegan foods that are necessary to you and your partner's health are too inconvenient or impractical, and thus the animal suffering involved is worth less than the amount of effort required from you. Therefore the better option is to eat the animal product version.

Possibly, depending on your ethical beliefs, you could justify eating meat if you hunt it yourself. This however does not align with the ethical belief systems of many people who choose to go vegan."

2328,2020-10-25 23:40:00,jhxf5c,"Here‚Äôs how it is for me. This is my personal issues that may not apply to you but might apply to your partner. I was vegan for a while and vegetarian for even longer. I liked and it and do, generally, believe in the ethics. I believe them to the point that I plan in going vegan again someday when it is healthy for me to do so. 
My restrictive eating and my sensory issues with food flared up really badly a couple years in. (This was, genuinely, unrelated to my diet and I don‚Äôt want to get into why because that isn‚Äôt the point here.) When my opinion restrictive eating flared up it stopped being possible for me to keep on enough weight on a vegan diet. I couldn‚Äôt really do it on even a vegetarian diet because my pickiness extends to some of the more calorie dense foods on a vegetarian diet as well. (I can‚Äôt eat  melted cheese and can only sometimes drink milk.) Meat was one of the few options I had that has enough calories in a small enough package. 
I can‚Äôt really choke food down either. If my brain stops recognizing a thing as food for the moment it‚Äôs done and it is torture to try to get more down. There are a few foods that doesn‚Äôt happen with and almost all are animal products. 
Basically, I have to think about me first. And you do as well. Remember, it doesn‚Äôt have to be all or nothing and you don‚Äôt have to be perfect. You can go back to an omnivorous diet and still not eat very many animal products. You can take a break and go back if you want. You could eat animal products not at home. Etc, etc. or you can go back to a completely omnivorous diet and that‚Äôs fine too. 

Be kind to yourself, basically. Let yourself experiment and expand and see how you feel. It‚Äôs hard to know what you really want when you don‚Äôt let yourself experiment."
2329,2020-10-26 11:03:13,jhxf5c,"I am personally agnostic on the first point about health and do attribute more credence to the last one you made approaching the issue of moral consistency - these are the two ""best"" arguments against veganism that I've heard. 


-




The first one is fairly transparent, that the sciences of nutrition and health are not yet conclusive on the question of a WFPB diet (or plant-based diets in general) and it isn't unwarranted to posit that genetic variation between individuals may offer enough metabolic distinction such that any one given diet is not going to be universaly applicable for every person. As such, as said previously, I am agnostic on this health issue and so I defer to individual people in making their own dietary choices with the expectation that most will do so honestly and in good faith according to their actual dietary needs.


-



The second point is a little more opaque and should be distinguished from a *tu quoque* fallacy. The idea here is not to accuse the other of immoral behavior and thus excuse our own, but rather to test the moral framework put up by veganism and investigate the consistency of the beliefs in accordance to that system. The reason to use this approach is that most of the powerful arguments for veganism are not made from first principles, but are rather arguments from consistency that hinge on previously acquired moral values and intuitions. A very simplified version of the argument would go something like this: ""you care to treat human beings and companion animals with love, kindness and respect - so why wouldn't you extend the same treatment to farmed or wild animals?"" Though a number of additional considerations should be taken into account when making an argument like this one, this is the boilerplate, 2-second version of it; The point here is to highlight that, just like with logical syllogisms, arguments from consistency depend on the validity of the premises to make a powerful point. Because I think it could be argued 1) there are recurring instances of disregard for the well-being of others perpetrated by almost all of us, vegan or otherwise, which are comparable to that which is caused by the consumption of animal products and animal use in general, eg. slavery-like practices in the garment and electronics production chains tacitaly sanctioned by 99% of the Western population 2) as such, unless these instances of imposed hardship are also contended with withing the vegan harm-reduction framework, there seems to be a weakening of the strong argument from consistency which could otherwise be made more easily for the moral 'oughtness' of veganism.

Just like yourself I make an effort to understand both sides of a discussion and despite never having quit veganism these are the best counter-arguments that I have been presented with to date."
2330,2020-10-26 14:04:02,jhxf5c,"I can only comment on the health aspect of the diet.

First: as others also stated, those athletes are not exclusively vegan:

&#x200B;

* The Serena sisters claim to follow a plant based diet but they also admit to cheating:

 *I try to make the majority of my meals raw and vegan, but I‚Äôm only human and am known to cheat a little bit,‚Äù says Serena.*

 [https://thebeet.com/venus-williams-follows-a-mostly-vegan-diet-and-here-is-exactly-what-she-eats/?utm\_source=tsmclip&utm\_medium=referral](https://thebeet.com/venus-williams-follows-a-mostly-vegan-diet-and-here-is-exactly-what-she-eats/?utm_source=tsmclip&utm_medium=referral)   


*  So while his diet is mostly plant-based, **Djokovic** does **eat** both eggs and **fish**. He also avoids the term 'vegan,' drawing a line between veganism and following a plant-based diet. ‚ÄúBecause of the misinterpretations of labels and misuse of labels, I just don't like that kind of name,‚Äù he explains. ‚ÄúI do **eat** plant-based.‚ÄùJun 10, 2020 

I only follow tennis, so I don't know about the other names you mentioned.

&#x200B;

Second: an exclusively plant based diet is not healthy long term. Sure, it might be for some people with lucky genetics and no food intolerances, but for many, it won't be. Just look at your SO, they were not healthy on a vegan diet.

So then, assuming that meat eating is not ethical (and that is a big assumption), the choices comes down to this: you can have an ethically sound diet, or you can have a health promoting diet. The choice is yours, no one (at least not me) will judge you however you choose."
2331,2020-10-26 18:06:52,jhxf5c,"On the health argument, which is really the most crucial argument in this entire debate: [DebateAVegan here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAVegan/comments/j3jebz/if_a_vegan_diet_is_more_optimal_for_human_health/) back-pedals on said athletes being vegan, and even swings to the opposite end logic-wise:

* ‚Äúathletes do things that are harmful to their bodies in the long-run anyway‚Äù ‚Äî implying omnivorism, funny how the pendulum swings depending on whether the diet athletes consume supports their ideology or not

2332,2020-10-27 03:46:04,jhxf5c,"I haven't really seen you engage since posting this, so I'm not expecting a response (not sure you will even find this in the deluge of posts below).  I was impressed with your post so I thought I'd throw out some thoughts as a fellow ""see all sides"" kind of person.

First, kudos to you for questioning things.  We should all question things more.

Second, you have a lot of assumptions in your post that I believe you have grown to accept as ""fact"" when they may not be as true as you believe.

For example, you say that because a few athletes are vegan ""any discussion that it's not possible to have a healthy vegan diet can be put to bed straight away"".  I think there is a good amount of evidence that not everyone thrives on a vegan diet.  The reasons might range from ""not doing it right"" to genetic mutations that make it harder for their bodies to get the required nutrients completely from plants.  I suspect that the real answer is that everyone lies on a spectrum that ranges from people who CAN thrive (maybe you?) to people who CAN'T (maybe your partner?).  I suspect somewhere between 5 and 50% of the population CAN thrive on a vegan diet.  Another 20-30% can survive.  The rest simply can't do it.  Their bodies aren't capable.  I think you will find similar ranges for most extremely strict diets.

Now, how to we cope with an ""ethical"" diet that will cause a large percentage of the population to be unwell?  What does that say about the people who can't eat a vegan diet and survive?  Are they unethical?  Are their genes unethical?  Is their microbiome unethical?

If it's ""ok"" for these people to eat meat in order to live, why isn't it OK for someone who doesn't have to?

The next big assumption you make is that killing animals is ""wrong"" and you have several justifications.  I think we can agree that torturing animals and deliberately causing suffering is ""wrong"".  We can probably also agree that a natural death of old age is ""not wrong"".  Everything dies.  Somewhere on the spectrum between those two extremes lies ""humane slaughter"" of animals for food.  Where that lies on the spectrum is a value judgement, but it's not as ""bad"" as making an animal suffer for hours, and it's not as ""good"" as an animal dying of old age.  You have to make that call yourself, but please realize that it's not the same thing as the vegan animal torture porn would have you believe.

Finally, what if eating animals were GOOD for the environment?  Would that change your mind about what is ""ethical""?  What if it were actually better for the animals and humans and the planet?  Would that change your opinion?  It turns out it might actually be true.  There is a farming practice known as ""regenerative farming"" that can restore land that is turning to desert, can restore soil to its natural ecosystem, and remove carbon from the atmosphere.

What is the key ingredient to regenerative agriculture?  Herbivores.  Ruminant animals.  Large packs of ruminant animals managed holistically RESTORE the soil, reverse desertification, and are a carbon sink.  Using regenerative agriculture we may be able to reverse climate change.  How would you feel if eating your burger was the responsible, ethical, and ecologically sound thing to do?

Good luck on your journey.  Don't take my word on any of this, keep questioning."
2333,2020-10-27 15:47:51,jhxf5c,"There's a lot of comments here, and I just want to point out that not everyone on this sub was once a vegan, and of those who *were* vegan, not all of them were *ethical* vegans. I feel like this is an important distinction to make because your post specifically asked for opinions from ex-ethicalvegans and many of the comments come from people who were neither. 

So, as an ex-ethicalvegan .... You make excellent points. I think it's very true that both sides have a tendency to demonise the other side, and to twist the facts to suit their point of view. I also like to take a middle-of-the-road viewpoint. I think going mostly plant-based can be very healthy. I think eating less meat can be better for the environment. I think it's unethical to eat caged eggs or farmed animals. 

Since you asked for reasons why I went back on being an ethical vegan, the truth is like most people here: health. I've developed food allergies in the past couple of years that made eating much more complicated too, and after introducing animal products I absolutely know now that I just wasn't getting enough protein, iron, b12, omega-3s, animal fats, cholesterol, etc., on a vegan diet. I just felt miserable and tired all the damn time, I had terrible insomnia, my eczema was the worst it's ever been, and finally when I had blood tests and the doctor said my iron was particularly low, I caved and started eating a lot of fish and game meats. 

Your last point interests me in particular, because it's absolutely something I would've thought about once upon a time. 

People in this group will come up with counterarguments on why it's okay to eat animal products, but as I said at the beginning of this comment, a lot of the people in this group were never vegans, and many not ethical vegans at that. I personally still believe that it's unethical to eat farmed animals, which is why I still don't eat eggs, consume dairy, or eat any animal meat except for game meat (kangaroo), and fish (because my body craves it). 

Honestly, I don't have an earth-shattering counterargument for you. I will say that I believe, since eating small amounts of meat is very healthy for humans, that eating animals occasionally is optimal for us - and if there's anything I've learnt, it's that optimal health is very, very important. For me, health comes first, before any ethics. If you are thriving like heck on a vegan diet - awesome! But if you're not, even if you're just more tired than usual, I see nothing wrong anymore with having a serving of rabbit 2x a week to rectify that. It's entirely possible to find a middle road between vegan and non-vegan. But overall, health trumps ethics."
2334,2020-10-27 21:48:08,jhxf5c,Simple answer is it is a deficient diet and strange you don‚Äôt mention the anti-nutrients in plants which can have dire effects on health. Enjoy those lectins.
2335,2020-10-31 15:04:07,jhxf5c,"I think your points are really solid, and I was in a similar position as you. I had been vegan for about 10 years, and I was really sick of it. 

To be honest, I don‚Äôt think there IS a genuine counterpoint to the points you raised. That being said, the solution I have come to is this:

I still consider myself vegan/vegetarian. I don‚Äôt eat meat ever, because that feels totally unjustifiable for me. However, when it goes to other animal products, I will consume/use them on a case by case basis. 

From a consequentialist point of view, I was exhausted and ready to give up entirely. But, the harm of a dozen or so free range eggs a month + the few ingredients here and there are significantly less harm than just giving up. And anyway, once I felt like I COULD eat other things, I didn‚Äôt really want them anyway. 

There‚Äôs no award for purity. Luckily, that‚Äôs not the goal anyway. 

Tldr: My suggestion would be to decide on a few low-impact foods or low-impact situations where you can be more lax if you want to."

Once you've come to grips with the philosophy, there seem to still be many reasons not to eat  too much meat so I don't think your diet would practically change that much."
2337,2021-02-16 12:59:12,jhxf5c,"Just putting my two cents in here. The thing most people can‚Äôt wrap their head around I think is that... when one school of thought tries to present their case to the other, the other takes it so wildly personally. I get that either side may or may not have a lot of emotion wrapped up in the topic, as who really wants someone telling them their way is wrong, we take it as a knock against our personal way of life. I GET IT. But overall, the best thing any of us can do to increase our sustainability is to buy/shop local, seasonal. Decrease the amount of items you buy that require shipping. I personal am vegetarian because I just don‚Äôt want to contribute to the harm of animals, I‚Äôm not pushing that way of life on anyone else. It‚Äôs just that simple fact. BUT I also don‚Äôt buy mock meat that‚Äôs highly processed and usually grain/soy based. Because to me that‚Äôs sort of similar to a meat eater buying BS frozen burger patties from the grocery store? I like to eat whole season foods. If everyone ate food (meats / dairy / fruit / veggies) that was local to them and seasonal I think we would all A.) be much healthier and B.) live a more sustainable life for the planet."

2344,2020-10-26 01:36:37,jhxf5c,"I wanna add a point I forgot before. Mono crop,  if you think it‚Äôs bad now.. heh. So basically animals can live anywhere. Side of a mountain. Desert. Marsh. Etc. But crops need large open patches of cleared land. They need the sunlight and the rain. And they need it flat. Because to get that crop in and out we need speed and ease. Your living on a hill and want to grow a crop?  You‚Äôre going to built embankments and slowly flatten it all. Vertical farming is what we call intensive farming. It‚Äôs a constant job to ensure soil, nutrients and watering is all done. That will not feed the masses of people we have. We need the large tracks of land we can use the tractors and equipment over to get it all in and out in time. Vertically requires far more hands on and human beings to care for. You can test this yourself. When you buy it make one of the pallet gardens that hang. You need to constantly water it. Use a mulch inside it to hold the water in. Chemical fertilizers since you cannot spread manure easily while the crop is growing. And you won‚Äôt get as much as when it‚Äôs grown in the ground. After time this system breaks down and requires more upkeep then just the soil at normal ground level. As this is far more easily worked with.  

You also spoke about how a lot of people say animals are not like us as how some people use this as a way to ok their diets. 
Well they are right. Animals are not like us. They don‚Äôt think of morals and ethics. They don‚Äôt understand death or suffering. Hence why we as keepers need to put their needs first. And as any farmer will tell you. We do. Every moment of our lives is.. get up. Check animals. Feed animals. Help animals. Grow or secure food for animals. Care for sick animals. Make money to care for the animals. Wake during the night to check on animals. Don‚Äôt have a vacation ever because you worry your animals will get hurt with out you. If you do go out your always thinking ‚Äúbetter check on them the moment I get back‚Äù. They are our lives. A vegan tends to think ‚Äúif you care for them this deepily how can you love them as much as I do that does not eat them‚Äù well. For myself. Death is a part of life. We all die no matter what we do to avoid it. What matters to us is that life has value. No pain. No suffering and is filled with what makes them happy. A shorter content life is better then a longer life full of suffering. It truly hurts me when I see a sanctuary parading a calf with missing legs around begging for donations because ‚Äúthe farmer was just going to put it down!‚Äù 
As a farmer. What I see is a calf that will never walk and has no spark to his eyes. It eats mechanically and waits day in and day out for someone to clean it. Move it. Treat the sores and give it more food. Haul it outside and leave it in the grass where anything hurting or poking at it or flies bothering it will keep doing so because the animal cannot do anything to help itself. To me. That is no life to live.  The other side is meat animals. These animals would still be meat animals if they where wild too. They are meat animals if they are pets. Why?  Because any predator will eat them if they can. We have just created a system to make best use of what we raise. Grow and have worked a system that allows the plant wastes we have from crops to be used as animal feed. Contrary to what narrative is pushed. If you work a farm you know you don‚Äôt feed the grade a corn seed to cattle. You grow soy. You remove the seed pods and use the seed for crops and selling. Then mash the plant stalks to animal feed. 
I utterly hate it when people say ‚Äúyou eat meat just for pleasure‚Äù. No. I don‚Äôt. Meat is expensive, I require it for my nutritional deficiencies. I require it for my b 12. I cannot absorb most things in pill form, I can‚Äôt eat leafy greens. I can‚Äôt eat nuts and gluten. So my iron levels are low. With out meat. I end up in a hospital. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs plenty more people like myself that don‚Äôt even know they cannot absorb properly because the meat they eat handles all the nutrients they need. 
Long story short.  Your always going to get people that complain you don‚Äôt do enough because you don‚Äôt do it their way. You don‚Äôt think what they want you to think. So you feel guilty. Trust me i know all about this from the years of fat shaming I received.  It‚Äôs not much different. Diet shaming still. However. You also must do what‚Äôs right for you. When someone says your life is worth as much as or less then a cow or pig. Then are they truly so ethical? Do you truly want to follow advice from someone like that?  The vegans I knew didn‚Äôt help me. Didn‚Äôt help animals. Sure they didn‚Äôt eat meat but they never did anything good for anyone.

I want to say that health issues are a valid reason to quit a palnt-based diet. However, I find that several of your points are unclear or misleading. 

\- You presented grass feeding animals as a solution to reducing the climate impact of meat. Could you detail how so please ?

\- You equated plant based diet with eating foods from far away and with having a large environmental impact. This is a mistake for two reasons. 

o First eating a plant based diet doesn‚Äôt mean one needs to eat food from far away (and reciprocally, eating an omnivore diet doesn‚Äôt mean eating local). Depending on where one lives, it‚Äôs possible to have a healthy plant based diet without consumming products coming from far away.

It shows, for example, that peas, a protein rich food, produce on average 0.8kg of CO2eq per kg of food product (including land use change, farm, processing, transport retail and packaging). By contrast producing beef on average emits 21-60 kg of CO2 eq per kg of produce (depending on whether the meet comes from the dairy herd, of from the beef herd). Emissions from the processing stage of beef alone, which is common to all beef farming types  exceed all emissions associated to pea production (1.2 kg of CO2 eq per kg of beef). (Per 100g of protein, beef production emits on average 25kg of CO2eq VS 0.36 kg for peas (https://ourworldindata.org/less-meat-or-sustainable-meat))."

> One thing that strikes me about your position is that you seem to claim that veganism is the opposition to animal suffering, torture, etc. Yet, so is welfarism as a non-vegan. You'd be right to claim that welfarism is not against the death of animals, but let's not act like veganism is the only response to bad animal conditions.

Gotcha. But this seems overly semantic, no? Let‚Äôs say I‚Äôm not calling myself a vegan but am behaving as OP and not eating animal products. Does labeling that as welfarism change anything? What are some of the alternatives that would, at scale, have as big of an impact as simply not eating meat?


> In fact, if we talk in terms of pains/pleasures during an animal life, it becomes plausible to talk about animal agriculture as an improvement to wild animal living. If you're coming from a deontological rights-based position that declares animals have the right to life, this might not appeal to you. But if your intuitions are more utilitarian, it might.

Noted. I‚Äôm not particularly interested in these topics, so I don‚Äôt have much to say about this. I understand your point though: there are alternatives to veganism. Same question as before/above though.

> And again, when you talk about farming and monocropping, you seem to think that veganism is the best option because much monocropping is used to feed animals. Again, that's not necessary. Some land is best for grazing. Many animals are fed aspects of vegetables that humans can't eat but other animals can, like corn husks.

This is likely true, but that‚Äôs makes me wonder essentially the same question again: do you think the benefits of having something to feed these waste crops too outweighs the negative ethical/environmental effects that come along with those animals, at industrial scale?


> You seem to brush aside arguments about spraying pesticides, using the age-old ""That's a gotcha, vegans aren't perfect"" defense. The reason that objection, and similar one's come up, is because it's hard to understand what veganism is at times.

Not trying to be confrontational, but what is your working definition? I didn‚Äôt realize there was a strict set of codes required to be vegan; I see it generally as a way to avoid unnecessary animal harm.

> Do you understand what principles you operate under in order to say that spraying and killing animals is acceptable? I'm not saying you can't make it work, that you can't have some sort of reasoning, but do you? Why can humans expand onto natural land, cutting down trees/homes of animals? Why can we pollute nature, killing animals indirectly? It's one thing to say ""I live by principle X, but it's hard to live by principle X perfectly"" vs. ""I don't eat meat, but I don't even understand what principle I live by which says I shouldn't.""

I find this paragraph fascinating because I also see lots of potential contradictions like this in both vegan and ex/anti-vegan arguments. That said, I‚Äôm still kind of confused by your proclivity towards labeling things. That might be because of how you work/think, and maybe I just think differently, but to me it doesn‚Äôt really seem to matter what we call it if factory farming is needlessly devastating life for some creatures.

Even then, much of the feed for animals are waste products from grain grown for human consumption. 

Vegans keep perpetuating the myth that 80% of soy is grown for cattle. This is wrong. It makes no sense to grow soy for animals from an economic basis. 80% of non-edible soy waste is given to cattle, which is a totally different thing than 80% of it grown specifically for cattle.

If you remove monocropping, you remove a lot of the environmental damage. One thing that vegans often assume is that non-veganism advocates the same amount of meat consumption as is currently going on. That somehow we have to keep up with demands.

There's lots of definitions, such as the one from the Vegan Society, but it's not on non-vegans to define veganism. If you're saying ""You should be vegan"", then there should be something which veganism actually is. Now, if you say veganism is ""avoiding unnecessary harms"", and then you avoid certain unncessary animal harms and not others and refuse to give reasons why then I can't really conclude that's what veganism is to you.

She was a vegan for about 20 years. She documents the slow decline in her health and how she was eventually forced to confront her own denial about the irreversible physical damage caused by the diet.

She provides a vivid description of eating canned tuna, her first animal food, since becoming vegan, and feeling her head clear and brain turn on, in a way she forgot was possible. It was both melancholy 
 and heartwarming.

She talks about the environmental impact of agriculture using examples of various US locations. But she describes them well and it never seemed unrelatable, to me.

Among many other things, she details how the American grain production industry has cornered the global market by arranging a massive US taxpayer funded subsidy, thus enabling them to sell grain around the world, for less than it actually costs to produce, putting local farmers, in developing countries, out of business and deeper into poverty.

But she does take a global view. She mentions some places in Japan and Northern Europe that have managed to develop a more sustainable agriculture industry due to local climate features.

I recommend you watch some of her interviews or listen to some of her long form podcast conversations. I own her book but ended up listening to the audiobook. She's not the narrator but the tone and style of the prose is exactly the same as she presents herself in the interviews, just much more detailed. If you like her on YouTube, that's what you'll get in the book.

One thing I'll point out is that she is a self-described ""radical feminist"", which is not brought up in the interviews I've seen/heard but does colour some of her ideas, toward the end of the book, about how to solve the problems she identifies.

Needless to say, I 100% agree with her on the facts presented in her book. They align with all my other reading and research. And while I am fully egalitarian, I have some nuanced but still very congenial disagreement with her on some, but not all, of her ideas to fix these global problems.

First of all, [this](https://theconversation.com/ordering-the-vegetarian-meal-theres-more-animal-blood-on-your-hands-4659) only attempts to estimate the death of mice. Yet, holistically speaking, there are hundreds (probably thousands) of species that die in the process of clearing, tiling, planting, fertilizing, irrigating (the number of animals killed and ecological damage caused by water redirected for irrigation alone is quite shocking), growing, harvesting, processing the plants and farm runoff. Further, [this](https://theconversation.com/ordering-the-vegetarian-meal-theres-more-animal-blood-on-your-hands-4659) uses the 13% of protein in wheat number without factoring its low [PDCAAS](https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/130/7/1865S/4686203) and overall poor/incomplete mix of amino acids, relative to beef and human health requirements. So, the real number of animals killed per pound of wheat protein is much higher and the amount of high quality wheat protein is much lower than even [this](https://theconversation.com/ordering-the-vegetarian-meal-theres-more-animal-blood-on-your-hands-4659) would suggest. 

Lastly, [this](https://youtu.be/1w1da3wdTjk) makes a bunch of false/misleading claims/assumptions about cattle ranching and then tries to pull a fast one by switching from deaths per pound of high quality protein to [deaths per calorie](https://www.animalvisuals.org/projects/data/1mc/).

Some people choose to selectively breed animals as an excellent and sustainable source of nutritions. Other chose plants. In the end, those are resources for us to utilize as superior and dominating specie. Any other animal in our position will do the same.

>means I can kill you and feed you to my dog and there's absolutely nothing wrong with it, if anything you deserved it for being a weakling who couldn't defend himself.

You would love that wouldn't you? Unfortunately for you we have human rights and laws between humans. Those were created for the purpose of meeting humans needs of safty, belonging, esteem and others. We are contributing to society and being productive to even support limited humans physically or mentally. We can't extend this to animals because we need them as food, you may disagree and play the propaganda card but i trust scientist and government over random illogical people, who appeal to emotions, and anti-scintists, 0.1% of the world, enlightend morally superior, unconditionally random animals lovers, mentally unstable and depressed according to popular research. 

For that reason about (meeting humans higher cognative needs), we built those societies and created those laws. Not because ""it's cruel and unnecessary to do crimes"" It's based on logical, scientific, and social needs. I can argue aginst each crime in the same pattern, logically, scientifically, and socially. 

Agian, nature and animals play the role of resources here. Once we find more efficient alternatives that don't compromise our lives, we will leave it be like when we replaced horses with cars."

‚Äú‚ÄúA totally vegan diet at this age is really not going to meet nutrient needs unless you use a lot of fortified products,‚Äù Dr. Dewey says.‚Äù

‚ÄúVegans had lower birthweight compared to lacto‚Äìovo‚Äìvegetarians (3015¬±420 g vs. 3285¬±482 g, P= 0.004), and to omnivores (3328¬±495 g, P< 0.001), but not to fish-eaters. Vegans also had a lower mean gestational weight gain compared only to omnivores (11.6¬±4.2 kg vs. 14.3¬±4.6 kg, P= 0.001).
Conclusion
The vegan diet is associated with an increased risk for small-for-gestational-age newborns and lower birthweight.‚Äù

> The last question, I'm not sure what you're asking. At what scale, and a big of an impact on what?

At industrial scale, and environmental impact.


> If you remove monocropping, you remove a lot of the environmental damage. One thing that vegans often assume is that non-veganism advocates the same amount of meat consumption as is currently going on. That somehow we have to keep up with demands. Some items are more luxurious than others, and if doing it in an environmentally satisfying way pushes meat items to more luxury items, then an environmentalist will accept that consequence. I also noticed you wrote ""negative ethical effects"", but I don't know what you're referring to.

I worded it poorly, but by ‚Äúnegative ethical effects‚Äù I meant the poor treatment of agricultural animals. I suppose some strict vegans may argue that the complete elimination of meat consumption by all humans is the end goal, but personally I think that the bigger concern is merely the vast reduction of meat consumption, so by making meat a relative luxury, like you describe, I would indeed be satisfied. The magnitude of societal changes required to make that happen, however, likely warrant a stronger, more ‚Äòstrict‚Äôly vegan opinion than my own, given how much resistance to this suggestion most people seem to have.


> There's lots of definitions, such as the one from the Vegan Society, but it's not on non-vegans to define veganism. If you're saying ""You should be vegan"", then there should be something which veganism actually is. Now, if you say veganism is ""avoiding unnecessary harms"", and then you avoid certain unncessary animal harms and not others and refuse to give reasons why then I can't really conclude that's what veganism is to you.

I‚Äôd never personally seen a definition for veganism before, but that Society‚Äôs one looks reasonable. The key part, for me, is: ‚Äúas far as is possible and practicable‚Äù.

We don't feed breed or protect animals, they're grown for consumption, nothing more nothing less, everything else is details the bottom line they are a bag of meat. That's just a weird sort of rationalization.

What's this about superior species. So you're saying that a species superior to ourselves has every right to enslave us and abuse us in any fashion they wish, because might makes right? Might makes force, it doesn't make right. A parent abusing their child doesn't make them right, it makes them abusers. Using your logic every parent has the right to abuse their children because they are stronger.

You think majority vote means the best candidate gets elected? nono, it means the best liar gets elected who can sell the most lies.

You're right though once preferable alternatives are found people will follow suit, but the proper lessons won't have been learned so the same problems will reappear across time in some other form or fashion. It's not about the animals themselves, it's about the principle.

We're either just another dumb animal on earth or we're something more, can't have it both ways. If we're more then we're subject to different principles than other animals, more advanced principles are we are capable of much more. Animals only operate on survival mechanisms and instinct, and yet they still understand basic principles like property rights like wolves don't fuck with other wolves territory outside of strenuating circumstances. they know to respect their neighbor because some redneck is gonna tell them to get the fuck off their lawn with a shotgun. It's intuitive at that level since they can't logically come to the understanding of property rights.

Either way if it's ok to kill an animal then its ok to kill a human since we're just any other animal. Laws are made up anyway nor are they reinforced in reality, it's people trying to control people and it doesn't work in the end anyway.

note that I only make this argument to point out the absurdity of people literally feel nothing at the thought of taking a life. By all intents and purposes they should be perfectly fine with someone trying to kill them and if they succeed that makes them right by might.

Upon searching through some studies I found that newer ones didn't find a causation between saturated fat and heart disease, so sorry about jumping the gun on that one. But I found this:

""The American Heart Association recommends aiming for a dietary pattern that achieves 5% to 6% of calories from saturated fat.

Scientists are currently looking into ways to reduce the number of these microbes in the animals gut one way being tested is a spray that is used over the animals feed.

And it's not offensive, as I don't find any of these arguments to be fully formed so there's not much to be offended by. I don't believe we are advanced at all and yes I do know we have absurd practices in every direction, including veganism and any ISM. Which is why it's illogical to think that we can make broad assumptions about our nutrition that go completely against what we've eaten for generations and what our biology has evolved to eat. I would like you to understand that your morality argument makes no sense because it assumes that humans and animals are somehow worthy of more respect than plants, bacteria, and any other beings that we share the earth with. This is obviously absurd. The cyles of consuming and being consumed CANNOT be avoided. The best we can do it do this in the way that we each think is most morally agreeable..which is why I'm fine with your illogical vegan reasoning, and also fine with my own reasoning that allows me to fully participate in the cycle of consuming and being consumed."

2444,2020-10-27 10:15:15,jhxf5c,">You got something to actually support why it's good or is blood drive the only reason for that? 

Yes, this podcast is really interesting about this topic. Well, it is mostly related to high iron levels in the blood and how that is detrimental. The thing is that the human body clings to iron because it was very valuable in prehistoric times (frequent injuries, high physical activity, etc.), so it does not have a mechanism to get rid of it, like it has for other minerals. So iron levels slowly accumulate in the body during decades and cause all kind of negative consequences. Losing blood reduces the red blood cell levels and thus indirectly the iron status of the blood/body. Granted, this is a bigger problem for men, because women have an in-build mechanism (menstruation) that helps them loose iron, at least pre menopause.

>it just means that your environment doesn't punish it enough in the short term to push for a change. 

Or humans always got enough actual vitamin A from animal products so there was never a need to upregulate the enzymes that are responsible for conversion.

>On the other hand every society that's every existed has eventually died from the inside, so clearly some of the recurring patterns that humans have is fundamentally wrong if we can't create a culture that sustains itself. 

And you think animal agriculture is the main reason for the eventual inside collapse of our society?"
2445,2020-10-26 00:58:33,jhxf5c,">  why not consider the entire lifecycle of the cow? 

Yes the cow eats and tramples animals (mostly insects). I don't count those. It's an animal living its life. If you believe it's better the cow never existed because it's killing other animals then you need to do that with wild animals as well. Should we exterminate anteaters because they kill 12 million ants per year? Where does it stop?

Even if you count them how do you know they are more than crop deaths for the same amount of calories? You don't.

> But, more to the point, what about the lack of evidence of any difference for either option do you find especially compelling as a counterpoint to OPs concerns regarding veganism?

If there is no proof either way then OP still has to explain by what logic they believe that it is morally superior to eat plants instead of animals. If they keep torturing themselves by being vegan they must have some real good reasons for it. I can't wait to read them."

2456,2020-10-26 15:32:01,jhxf5c,"I'm an ex vegan. I swallowed the propaganda whole and lasted for a year without ingesting any animal products. My health deteriorated rapidly and 20 years later I'm still healing.

It's next to impossible to get any significant amount of protein on a vegan diet without soy. Soy is a main ingredient in nearly all processed vegan food. It's in almost every processed food in some amount, vegan or not.

Soy is a major allergen. Many, many people are allergic or sensitive to soy, myself included.

I don't have an instant, anaphylactic reaction, I experience joint aches, digestive issues, headaches, brain fog, depression, anxiety. Doctors I saw didn't think to question my diet when I reported these symptoms; general practitioners rarely look to diet for illness-causing culprits and prefer to prescribe pills instead. 

It's taken me until only recently to figure out that I needed to eliminate soy because my symptoms were cumulative rather than acute. The standard American diet is heavily plant based, so even quitting veganism didn't mean that I was entirely safe from soy, but it certainly meant I was eating less of it.

With all that said, at the beginning of my vegan experiment, I ate 0 processed food. I wasn't eating any soy, and I actually felt a little better for that first few weeks, which is why I didn't instantly quit. I made everything I ate from scratch. I combined grains and beans that I soaked and cooked myself. I ate tons of fresh vegetables and fruit. 

Sadly, after that first few weeks this whole foods approach no longer felt good. It took so much of my time. I was constantly hungry and cranky. I was always eating but never satiated. 

After 6 months of that, I gave up and began to buy processed vegan meat. I lasted 6 more months that way before deciding I needed animal products back in my life in order to be healthy.

Impossible meat ingredients:

Water, Soy Protein Concentrate, Coconut Oil, Sunflower Oil, Potato Protein, Methylcellulose, Soy Leghemoglobin, Glutamates, Natural Flavours, Sugars (Cultured Dextrose), Salt, Modified Plant Starch, Yeast Extract, Mixed Tocopherols (Antioxidant), Soy Protein Isolate, Thiamine Hydrochloride (Flavour), L-Tryptophan, Zinc Gluconate, Niacin (Vitamin B3), Ferric Phosphate, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride (Vitamin B6), Calcium Pantothenate (Vitamin B5), Riboflavin (Vitamin B2), and Vitamin B12.

Also about that [heme](https://www.greenmatters.com/p/what-is-heme-impossible-foods): 

Unlike the heme found in beef, the heme in the Impossible Burger is made by taking the DNA from the roots of soy plants, inserting it into genetically engineered yeast and then fermenting that yeast.

The heme in impossible meat is genetically engineered yeast poop.

I'll give the genetically engineered, factory produced, long-distance shipped pseudofood a pass. 

I'd rather honor animals by sourcing meat from local farms that employ sustainable practices, eating their meat and accepting that I am part of an ancient, natural ecosystem."
2457,2020-10-26 04:33:51,jhxf5c,">The magnitude of societal changes required to make that happen, however, likely warrant a stronger, more ‚Äòstrict‚Äôly vegan opinion than my own, given how much resistance to this suggestion most people seem to have.

I think my reply here will satisfy the above parts.

It would take a societal change, but so does veganism. I think it's less of a tough sell to say ""Hey, let's not put animals in horrible conditions, lets tighten up the laws on animal farming at the cost of a prince increase/reduction"" than ""Eating meat is morally wrong, meat is murder, eggs are exploitation, insemination is rape"" etc.

>I‚Äôd never personally seen a definition for veganism before, but that Society‚Äôs one looks reasonable. The key part, for me, is: ‚Äúas far as is possible and practicable‚Äù. I believe it‚Äôs crucial because it is neither absolute nor reductionist‚Äîand it allows for all the scenarios we‚Äôre discussing to be considered vegan behaviors, no?

Yeah, by appealing to something vague. They can't call you a hypocrite if you refuse to be specific. One person can do action X and call himself a vegan and another person can say action X is not vegan and there's no way to know whose right. I find that silly. Might as well declare myself a vegan and continue to eat meat."

It's not hard to read a book. You're making important life choices. You should put in the effort to educate yourself. No one should be blindly following diet/lifestyle trends.

The book is a long form narrative going into all the issues I raised in thoughtful detail. These are not simple issues. It's beyond my abilities to summarize it for you in just a few sentences. I encourage you to google the author's name and watch/listen to some of her many interviews.

I feel bad for you because, while you do seem earnest, you also appear to be ideologically captured and not able to see some very obvious truths.

Let's take this one step at a time.

I'm going to ask you some questions to see if you understand the issues I raised:

Do you concede that large numbers of native animals are killed in deeply inhumane ways, every year, as [land is cleared](https://theconversation.com/land-clearing-isnt-just-about-trees-its-an-animal-welfare-issue-too-80398) for plant agriculture and through [Slash-and-burn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash-and-burn) / [Open agricultural burning](https://ccacoalition.org/en/activity/open-agricultural-burning)?

Yes or No? (It's not a trick question)"

You'd have to use the argument that it's inherently and intrinsically wrong and immoral 

Wrong. I told you that i can debate non-mentally ill people and convince them why those crimes are unacceptable and unlawful using logical, scientific, and social arguments. You can't do the same for animals.

Be my guest if you want to argue in favor of murder, rape, stealing, or any crime or unlawful act. Maybe you will learn something beside ""It's CrEuL and UnEsSaRy"" 

>What's this about superior species. So you're saying that a species superior to ourselves has every right to enslave us and abuse us in any fashion they wish, because might makes right? 

You are confused about humans rights and rights in general. If a superior specie were to dominate us, why would you expect them to give you any of what you call rights? Only if we have any objective value to them or they don't need us in anyway that they will keep us alive in your hypothetical scenario. We will have the options to fight or lose our well and cognitive skills and become useless animals for their utilization.

>You want a world of psychopaths? You got it buddy.

Fortunately, i am away of mentally ill people like you who threatene people but you will never get far either way. You are to abide by the rules or forfit your rights of freedom or other rights depending on your crime. The same cannot be applied to animals as vegans always say that they don't have moral compass. Which is exactly why they are resources for us and lesser specie. 


>prioritize your personal freedom regardless of what anyone tells you your role in this life is.

Isn't that what is called survive? You can have other 'nobel' goals or altruism but even those give you self validation and emotional acceptance. You love to tell people that they are wrong and immoral while you are morally superior dont you? Surprise news, no one cares about what enters your mouth and exit from your bottom be it animals or plants or chemically synthetic supplements. 


>Your government requires your ignorance and your silent compliance, as your superiors, to do what they want without consequence.

Much more better than communism which will make you work in a canning factory all your life. At least we have the power and capital to change. Please return to orginal subject. We are talking about animals here. Not economy or humans problems.

>This isn't about appeal to emotion, this is cold logic. If you don't like logic and prefer to live by what is convenient for you that's your choice, but don't pretend its something else with these headcanons of yours.

I didn't get you here but i didn't say that you shouldn't have your own morals and love to animals without a valid reason All what i said is you need to give objective value or convince me with a logical or scientific evidence as i don't feel the same to animals and it is a fallacy for a reason because it will not hold in the discussion.

>Regardless I hope your moral relativism is cured someday, I really do. Honestly by the sounds of it you've experienced some serious childhood trauma that's been left unresolved.

Lol. It might be my father taking me to one of those butcher shops when i was a kid to buy chicken where they slaughterd the chicken in front of us and we cooked it freah that day. It was one of the most delicious meals in my life. I properly consumed every peace and was thankful that i could continue my life and be a better person for its sacrifice.

2470,2020-10-26 15:20:19,jhxf5c,"One of the issues with methane is that the rate of increase since the industrial revolution is higher than CO2, and the concentration is increasing. [The methane budget](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/12/1561/2020/), released this year, puts the methane added into the atmosphere after 1750 at 23% of the effective radiative forcing since then. They write:

""From an emission perspective, the total radiative forcing attributable to anthropogenic CH4 emissions is currently about 0.97‚ÄâW‚Äâm‚àí2 ([Myhre et al., 2013](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/WG1AR5_Chapter08_FINAL.pdf))""

Where the total warming attributed to anthropogenic GHG emissions are 3.0 W m-2.

It is generally accepted that 40% of the anthropogenic methane released is from animal agriculture, which means that 0.388 W m-2 can be attributed to the methane released from animal agriculture, which also amount to 5% of CO2 emissions and 53% of N2O. [The FAO](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/WG1AR5_Chapter08_FINAL.pdf) puts grassland carbon sequestration at 0.6 Gt of CO2eq globally, where livestock release 7.1 Gt of CO2eq. Numbers attributed to carbon sequestration is uncertain, and what is even more uncertain is how much cattle improves it.

There is definitely a way to incorporate methane emissions in the natural cycle, but since methane concentrations are so high, and there are so many cattle, it is not good for the environment.

I love and respect cattle and think it can be done well, since it is part of a unsustainable system, the cattle themselves are unsustainable."
2471,2020-10-26 14:46:40,jhxf5c,Is this the reason you justify eating meat? Or are you waiting to consume meat until that spray is put into production large scale?
2472,2020-10-27 11:50:32,jhxf5c,"At the very very core, the main reason is people living in disharmony with certain natural principles like objective morality. Here me out cuz I know a lot of people balk at the idea of both objectivity as well as morality let alone the two together. 

The bottom line is civilizations collapse because people are fucking up, and not just one time but across time and in ways that short term doesn't affect you that bad but long term has a huge effect. Take as an example eating habits. Short term one soda and a pizza won't kill you, hell a week of eating it every day you'll likely start to feel sick unless there's something wrong with the organism and its ability to sense its own state of well being, and by a year of it you'll see significant drop in quality of health, fitness, mental and emotional health, as well as physical appearance, and with those drops you will have the accompanying lifestyle choices that further drag a person down. I can say with all things moderation is a good lesson to learn, but when you start to add things like criminal behavior to the list of unsustainable behavior, as well as what kinds of societal conditions fuel that sort of behavior, and what kinds of childhood conditions fuel that behavior etc, you start to get a picture of what kind of behavior ripples across time in good ways and bad ways. 

Take as a simple example the usa starting a war for the bush family's oil business to make some profit. They make their money but their actions ripple across time, people all over the world hate america, and there were likely people driven to criminal behavior by circumstances of war. I can't fault someone who had to steal to eat as an example, but I can fault the aggregate culture that enabled these conditions and the people within it that enabled those conditions. Nothing in this world just happens.

I don't think animal agriculture is the main reason for a society's collapse, but I do think that the society's collective developed and normalized apathy towards life, to the degree that they don't give a shit over how the meat shows up on the supermarket shelves as long as it's there on time, is definitely a big part of it.

How you do one thing is how you do all things. People who are apathetic or ignorant over how the meat gets on the shelf is going to be apathetic and ignorant over a lot of other things, they don't care so much about right or wrong as they do their convenience. Someone else worded it perfectly about how the culture puts their convenience and practicality over morality.

The bottom line is, morality is the freedom and evolution of the human race. One of the steps towards both of those things is to recognize that life is sacred, and the murder of living beings is wrong, and that the consumption of anothers flesh is basically a death ritual to some death god of an ancient tribe. Like this is literally what old dead civilizations did is they would ritually kill and consume flesh thinking it gave them strength. Like we always got said vitamins from animals ok, but maybe there's always been a better, proper way to do it. It's like imagine as a simple example that once upon a time we used horse carriage for transportation. We always used horses is probably what people who didn't wanna try new methods of transportation that were better and safer. I'm putting aside the fossil fuels debate aside for the sake of not convoluting the topic any more than it has to be idk what your stance is on the subject but we put it aside. Maybe the consumption of flesh is that horse carriage, and only plant based diets as well as a society structured around that kind of norm is the next level in the technology of food. I have yet to see people's justification being anything outside of nazi supremacy levels of ideology of we are superior therefor we do what we want and animals are here to serve us. And frankly by their logic anyone who can overpower them should by right of might either put them to work on slave fields or just eat them too. Like it's just a nonsense argument I hear every time, either that one or the we need this argument which isn't true so much as we're used to this and don't know or are scared of the turbulence a paradigm shift would involve.

I for one recognize that humans while also part of the animal kingdom, are not just animals, we are capable of more than just the blind perpetuation of the predator/prey dichotomy but most of society operates like that. There are literally people who their mind operates like prey or predator unconsciously and getting them to use their frontal lobe is like pulling teeth its like literal brain damage.

Sorry for the length It's just there's a lot of information that has to be covered and people need to understand, regardless of their stance on meat, that there are certain basic principles on earth that need to be recognized and lived in harmony with, or life doesn't improve for anyone."

I guess so, yeah. That sort of balanced reasoning is probably where humanity will be in the end, but as with most things, it tends to go one way, then the opposite, before falling somewhere more nuanced in between. Conceptually, as I see it, veganism is essentially a response to the unbridled and unethical excesses of factory farming, so vegans naturally seem excessive themselves in an attempt to counterbalance.


> Yeah, by appealing to something vague. They can't call you a hypocrite if you refuse to be specific. One person can do action X and call himself a vegan and another person can say action X is not vegan and there's no way to know whose right. I find that silly. Might as well declare myself a vegan and continue to eat meat.

Right, but I don‚Äôt think the intent behind most vegan people‚Äôs desire to reduce animal-product consumption is so they can call you a hypocrite :P I‚Äôm teasing, of course, since I‚Äôm pretty sure your point is about logical truth and how you want/need concrete and deterministic reasoning in order to convince you.

> Do you concede that large numbers of native animals are killed in deeply inhumane ways, every year, as land is cleared for plant agriculture and through Slash-and-burn / Open agricultural burning?

Yes. Further, depending on your definition of veganism and where you live, being fully ""vegan"" may not be possible when accounting for these.

> It's beyond my abilities to summarize it for you in just a few sentences.

This isn't what I'm asking for. I'm asking for specific evidence for a specific claim you've made: ""The deaths per pound of essential digestible protein, of any plant food vs. grass fed beef, simply do not compare"". Unless this author collected their own data and performed their own statistical analysis, and the book is a presentation of these findings (""The book is a long form narrative"" contraindicates this), then the book is not an adequate source for the claim.

Of ""all the issues you raised in thoughtful detail"", I'm not really interested in anything besides that claim. In the context of the OP, your views on how the vegan diet affects health do not address the OPs perspective and don't seem to be a good faith effort to respond to OP's concerns. There's another bad faith comment,  ""This is not a secret yet somehow the vegan community seems to be blissfully unaware"": the subs /r/debateavegan and /r/askavegan discuss this issue frequently, and there are plenty of videos on it from youtube vegans...idk why you think the vegan community is unaware of those issues, besides for wanting a ""gotcha"".  
And, in your last comment, (paraphrased), ""I feel bad for you bc you seem...ideologically [blind]""...literal insults, combined with the evasion of my ask, don't give me hope as to the approach you're taking.  

Yet, those comments don't detract from the specific claim, but mean I'm really not interested in a whole exchange or anything.  
Look it's OK if you can't back that claim up. This is just reddit. I'm gonna respond at most once more, but I'm really looking for one thing, which is evidence to back up that claim you made. If that claim relies on a series of conclusions...just lay those out. If you insist on ""one step at a time"" while evading the question, it's reasonable from my perspective to think it's a wild goose chase, and I'll respectfully not respond.

Some behaviors are unsustainable on earth without a host to parasite off of. Like for example a thief can't eat if there's no one to steal from, it's an unsustainable behavior with a critical dependency on an enabler. You need farmers who can actually grow the food, and who are unable or unwilling to defend themselves or their property for you to be able to steal from them. Farmers on the other hand them growing food on the land is moral behavior because it can be universalized and there's no abuser/enabler relationship. You just take that concept and apply it to everything and you can decide logically what is a net benefit to any society and what is a net positive, or what is moral or immoral. everything that doesn't fit in either of those categories falls in the preferences box like it's not immoral to prefer apples to oranges, that's just personal taste.

Anything else whether its health or whatever that's just trying to attack an issue from another angle to see what sticks, different approaches work on different people. but the bottom line is it will always at its core be an ethics issue. What I don't like is those retarded fad vegans like those yoga pants girls who are vegans but they're trashy people and only picked it up cuz it's some sort of like instagram statement. They end up behaving trashy anyways because they're doing it for all the wrong reasons and in the end don't give a shit about ethics. People's moral relativism essentially means morality is whatever you say it is, and in the society it means whatever you can get away with and laws are just obstacles to figure out how to get around them. If you have a society full of people like this you have total fucking chaos, and moral relativism needs to be properly recognized as a mental illness and treated very seriously like danger to society level of serious. You don't treat dudes like al bundy or mark manson or whatever their names were, those famous serial killers, you don't treat those kinds of people lightly and yet our culture supports their way of thinking all but in name. is it any wonder most world leaders and ceos of most of the powerful companies in the world are psychopaths with no conscience or fucks given about anyone but themselves?

Here we can see your blind hate for your fellow humans just because they disagree with you which is sad and hepocricy that you will depend on society for safty, belonging, and physical/mental needs yet you prefer dumb animals who will be happy to kill you if chance arise to them.

To some extent yes but we are kinda of more advanced than that. A person can find a society that will accept them and human rights are global organizations that will help anyone out of being a fellow human being that will be potentially a productive member of society. Otherwise, in the old days, you could literally just attack another tribe and enslave all people there and kill them. No one will ask if it was moral or not.

Us utilizing all resources for our advancement in science, technology and medicine including bending nature and animals to our needs is what made us reach this point in history questioning whether we should consume/utilize this dumb animal or take a chemically synthesized supplements."

>Why do you need proof?

I try to base my actions as much as possible on facts rather than on my feelings, so I'm very often trying to find proofs that what I think is the best thing to do, is indeed the best thing to do. I think it is critically important especially in terms of climate change and environmental impacts because the processes at work are very numerous and intertwined, meaning that our common sense, and feelings are often wrong. E.g. we understandably feel that importing products from the other side of the earth is very polluting (because we rightly have the image of huge container ships), but transport  is actually less polluting than what cows produce through enteric fermentation (per kg of food product, [https://ourworldindata.org/food-choice-vs-eating-local?fbclid=IwAR2Op5pHFQPLr9GghYq6kdEzwiKRnMnro9fU\_buvsM5L4dA5k1a\_\_i5X7ZQ](https://ourworldindata.org/food-choice-vs-eating-local?fbclid=IwAR2Op5pHFQPLr9GghYq6kdEzwiKRnMnro9fU_buvsM5L4dA5k1a__i5X7ZQ)). This means that the seemingly impact-free grazing of a cow in a field next door pollutes more than growing and importing peas or beans from another continent. This is extremely counter-intuitive and this is why I need proof.

&#x200B;

>Do you have proof that the alternatives (since people need to eat something) are sustainable?

This depends on what type of animal food you‚Äôre thinking about. For meat, farmed fish, and milk I do. For alternatives to cheese I don‚Äôt.

I recommend reading this article from Science published in 2018. This is the most comprehensive study ever conducted on agriculture ‚Äú Poore and Nemecek \[the authors\] consolidated data on the multiple environmental impacts of ‚àº38,000 farms producing 40 different agricultural goods around the world in a meta-analysis comparing various types of food production systems.‚Äù

The authors quantify the environmental impacts of the main foods, and find that plant products are consistently more environmentally friendly than animal products. If you don‚Äôt want to bother reading the whole article, there are a few webpages from OurWorldinData that use data from the article and present it very well:

No, humans are not equal to animals. We shouldn't protect animals from other animals, because that's nature.

I have trouble understanding what you call misleading propaganda. I only provided a link to a peer-reviewed scientific article published in a scientific journal, and to graphs derived from scientific articles on a website that scrupulously cite its sources. Could you explain in which way this is propaganda?

I only provided this one scientific article because it is a huge piece of work, but in an attempt to prove I‚Äôm not cherry picking, here are a few other major articles (some published in the most prestigious and most widely read scientific journals) that all indicate that plant foods are more environmentally friendly than animal derived foods: 1‚Äì8

&#x200B;

>You do understand that ""emissions"" from cows are essentially irrelevant since they don't create carbon out of nothing. They simply take the carbon (that is already in circulation) from the plants and put it in the atmosphere

This is an unsupported assertion, and this is false, as shown by the fact that the FAO, the IPCC, and scientific articles take into account carbon and nitrogen emissions from livestock 9‚Äì11 (the only emissions from livestock that are not taken into account are the emissions from livestock respiration12). It‚Äôs false because (A) ruminants emit methane, which is a more potent GHG than CO2 over its 10-year life span (before it‚Äôs oxidized into CO2) ([https://www.britannica.com/science/greenhouse-gas/Methane](https://www.britannica.com/science/greenhouse-gas/Methane)), (B) livestock produce N2O which is an even more potent GHG than CO2 (298 times) ([https://climatechange.lta.org/get-started/learn/co2-methane-greenhouse-effect/](https://climatechange.lta.org/get-started/learn/co2-methane-greenhouse-effect/), [http://www.fao.org/gleam/results/en/](http://www.fao.org/gleam/results/en/); (C) grazers eat grass made of organic carbon and release that carbon (either directly through respiration, enteric fermentation and manure, or indirectly after being eaten by humans), some of this carbon would otherwise have been trapped in the soil, reducing the amount of carbon in the atmosphere 11 (see page 32 and the next few pages of 11).

&#x200B;

>Also the rich soil that the ruminants create can store up to 10 times more carbon compared to mono crops.

Again, this is an unsupported claim. In addition, this argument is irrelevant because in a world without domestic grazing animals, pastureland would be replaced by natural vegetation, not crops. This is because producing animal products is very land-use intensive (grass fed animals, particularly cows being the worst) 2,6,10. In the article I cited previously, the authors find that ‚ÄúMoving from current diets to a diet that excludes animal products (table S13) (35) has transformative potential, reducing food‚Äôs land use by 3.1 (2.8 to 3.3) billion ha (a 76% reduction), including a 19% reduction in arable land ¬ª 10.

&#x200B;

If you want to assess comparatively the carbon storing potential of ruminants, compare it to that of the local natural ecosystem, which is often forest, that stores much more carbon than grasslands 13. There actually is a whole article published in September in Nature Sustainability that studies the amount of carbon we could store if everybody ate a plant-based diet and natural vegetation could reestablish on land currently used to farm animals 13.

&#x200B;

In addition, from another study published in Science in 2018: ‚ÄúMajor claims have been made for the potential of livestock production by grazing to be a major net benefit for climate change by promoting CO2 storage (57); however, careful analyses have shown that the estimated benefits are highly locality specific and that at a global level the benefits are modest at best and outweighed by the emissions that the animals produce (56, 58, 59)‚Äù 8.

&#x200B;

This is also what is explicitly stated in this report from the Food Climate Research Network, a research group based in Oxford: ‚ÄúIn many parts of the world the potential for grazing management to achieve sequestration is limited or absent.‚Äù; ‚ÄúEvidence as to the sequestration benefits of holistic, adaptive and other variants of rotational grazing is patchy and highly contradictory. Where there are benefits, these are small.

‚Ä¢ The highly ambitious claims made about the potential for holistic grazing to mitigate climate change are wrong.

‚Ä¢ The sequestration potential from grazing management is between 295‚Äì800 Mt CO2-eq/year: this offsets only 20-60% of annual average emissions from the grazing ruminant sector, and makes a negligible dent on overall livestock emissions.

‚Ä¢ Expansion or intensification in the grazing sector as an approach to sequestering more carbon would lead to substantial increases in methane, nitrous oxide and land use change-induced CO2 emissions.‚Äù11.

>It is guaranteed that most your plants require more fossil fuel use than my local meat and dairy.

This is arguably right but is irrelevant in terms of climate impact. If cows emit more methane and N2O than do machines that burn fossil fuels to produce plant foods, then plant foods are the most environmentally friendly foods. This is clearly shown in the references I gave in my previous comment. But let‚Äôs try again. Authors from a 2017 article found that grass fed-beef production emits as much GHG as grain-fed beef production2. But let‚Äôs be generous and consider that the beef you‚Äôre talking about emits the lowest of all values found in 10, around 3.5kg of CO2eq per 100g of protein (at least 44% of this is due to enteric fermentation according to the FAO btw so there is no margin of progression here ([http://www.fao.org/gleam/results/en/](http://www.fao.org/gleam/results/en/))). Even when we are that generous, GHG emissions associated to beef production are still 5 and 10 times as much as that associated to bean and pea production respectively (0.65kg and 0.36kg of CO2eq per 100g of protein)10([https://ourworldindata.org/less-meat-or-sustainable-meat](https://ourworldindata.org/less-meat-or-sustainable-meat)).

&#x200B;

>I don't doubt that having more CH4 in the atmosphere is a problem, but I don't believe it can be compared with fossil fuel use.

You‚Äôve provided no evidence and it can be very well compared with fossil fuel use, as is done routinely in the litterature (see all the articles I cited).

&#x200B;

>BTW I forgot to add that if we are talking sustainability we can't ignore desertification and the destruction that pesticides and the other -cides cause (pollution, eradicating insect species etc.). Both are part of plant production and both can be avoided by switching to grass fed animal foods.

This is a very general statement backed by no evidence. I won‚Äôt bother arguing about it as ""What can be asserted without evidence can also be dismissed without evidence.""

If you‚Äôll only answer by stating unsupported opinions and feelings, I won‚Äôt bother to answer. I always make cautious statements supported by hard evidence, and I‚Äôm tired of having to counter unsupported general and extremely bold statements thrown at me such as

2557,2020-11-05 03:10:34,jhxf5c,">some of this carbon would otherwise have been trapped in the soil

This is wrong. The carbon sequestered in soil is separated from the carbon in vegetation above ground. In fact, if you are talking about soil carbon sequestration, grazing is a much better system than crop farming because grazing does not disturb the soil but crop farming does, thus releasing the carbon stored there.

>‚ÄúMoving from current diets to a diet that excludes animal products (table S13) (35) has transformative potential, reducing food‚Äôs land use by 3.1 (2.8 to 3.3) billion ha (a 76% reduction), including a 19% reduction in arable land ¬ª

If you actually look at their [supplementary materials](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/suppl/2018/05/30/360.6392.987.DC1/aaq0216-Poore-SM-revision1.pdf), you would see that after adding up all available data on land use, the authors could only come up with a bit more than half of the above land use for animal agriculture, Table S10 p.35. So they added in the rest (1.36 billion ha) to match with data from FAO which [FAO themselves have corrected recently](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2211912416300013). They stated that ""The usually reported area of permanent grasslands is 3.5 billion ha (FAOSTAT, 2016), of which about 1.5 billion ha has no livestock because it corresponds to very marginal rangelands and shrubby ecosystems (Map 1).""

>If you want to assess comparatively the carbon storing potential of ruminants, compare it to that of the local natural ecosystem, which is often forest, that stores much more carbon than grasslands

This is a common misconception for 2 things. 

1) From the same [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2211912416300013) above, only 35% of land currently used for animal agriculture can be converted for other purposes like crop production. The rest is permanent grassland, so you couldn't just turn it into forest. 

2) Take a look at [this report by IPCC](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/03/srl-en-1.pdf), table 1, page 4. Carbon stock of temperate grasslands is only below boreal forests and wetlands, which again you can't just magically turn into. Grassland is on par with tropical forests and better than temperate forests or croplands. Raising livestock on grassland also further improves its carbon sequestration [[1](http://www.dasnr.okstate.edu/Members/donald-stotts-40okstate.edu/carbon-sequestration-a-positive-aspect-of-beef-cattle-grazing-grasslands)], [[2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308521X17310338#bb0140)].

>The sequestration potential from grazing management is between 295‚Äì800 Mt CO2-eq/year: this offsets only 20-60% of annual average emissions from the grazing ruminant sector, and makes a negligible dent on overall livestock emissions.

Sequestration from current method is already higher than that, more than 90% as shown from methane concentrations in the atmosphere. Changing to grazing would improve that further."

Do I really need evidence that your plants that are harvested with combine harvesters and/or shipped from other continents require more fossil fuel use than my local grass fed meat/dairy? It's just common sense.

My questions that remain unanswered: 

1) How can you compare (with a single graph) 2 completely different things: new carbon (fossil fuel) and recycled carbon (cows). How is that not misleading/propaganda?

I think it was cute and intimate that they just invited her closets friends and family, why invite random   celebrity acquaintances who they only see a couple times a year at parties.

NCAA -- National Collegiate Athletic Association

Basically if a college participates in nearly any sport, it is likely goverened by the NCAA. Of course, Football is the most popular, but Basketball, Baseball, Volleyball, etc. are all covered.

One of the stipulations of students to be eligible to play is that they cannot be paid to do so and there are some heavy limits on prize money for events. The idea is they are students first, athletes second; I assume this is the point the Amateur Task Force was driving at."
2634,2020-12-10 19:16:45,kajl5r,"Thank you for this write up! I‚Äôm one of those broke adults trying to learn how to ride in a borrowed saddle on a borrowed horse, but I follow some local girls on Instagram who are all seemingly competing for enough social media attention to get a few free saddle pads. What is with the saddle pad obsession? 

I heard about the proposed rule change and, knowing very little about hunter/jumper world, was shocked by how strict they were! Cant accept payment for giving lessons to kid beginners, or riding other people‚Äôs horses because you‚Äôre too broke to afford your own, or receiving some tail conditioner to promote on your Insta without having to compete at a higher level? It just highlights how elitist the sport is and has always been. You gotta be rich, you gotta have parents that supported you financially while you learned how to ride, or you gotta work impossibly hard to balance a career, a family, and a horse hobby."

IRH tried to sponsor my college team, I guess if we had accepted we'd all be professionals?

I'm honestly having a hard time thinking of any riders I know who wouldn't be classed as a professional under the initial rule.  Everyone earns side money by teaching, or schooling horses, or doing groom work, or whatever else."

It's the kind of thing I'd love to let my daughter experience, but the people are too nuts. Same thing with some of the kid's hockey leagues - I'd compare horse parents to hockey parents. Generally upper middle class folks with a chip on their shoulder pretending they're wealthy. We can't afford to do *actual* wealthy people horse things."

Like, prohibitively strict. I‚Äôm sure the USHJA in particular is feeling some of the pressure after the whole USEF vs. World Equestrian Center situation; a LOT of amateurs were saying they were jumping ship to the National Snaffle Bit Association or were at least very close to doing so. I‚Äôm glad they reformed it to rules that actually made sense."
2651,2020-12-11 03:20:03,kajl5r,"I love your footnote.

So that's all how the amateur sections are all going to be shaped now, but how is that going to protect the amateur sections from being trounced at every turn by the person who rides 10-12 hours a day?  Because those rules still seem like they aren't actually making anything better for the people who were already being frustrated by lack of access.  It just increases access for people who do have 10-12 hours of riding every day by saying ""and NOW you can get PAID!""  I mean, money's great, but that's kind of not actually the real problem, you know?"

As many people have pointed out, horse people are absolutely crazy so there's always great drama but unfortunately it often involves horses being treated badly... I was a very committed horse girl between the ages of about 10 and 17 and I am literally hearing about the concept of Show Hunter competitions for the first time, I don't think it exists in the Netherlands where I grew up... What a weird idea - and I am saying that as someone who mostly did dressage which most people think is silly and is obviously also judged by often opaque standards...

I've been following it but I come from the quarter horse world so I'm less familiar with all the intricacies. It's been entertaining me to no end though.

Speaking of quarter horses, we have so many not professional categories it's almost silly, but it has brought more people to the shows. There are 3 levels of amateur now based on show experience. Keeps the pro/heavily experienced amateurs in their own group. Makes the shows really long though."

2665,2020-12-11 03:03:52,kajl5r,"I come from a Tennessee Walking Horse family so not sure how I feel about the abuse jab. Not sure if anyone in the industry could weigh in but my understanding has been over the years they have stopped allowing irritation of their legs to the point they get sores with chains and mustard or anything like that, and they regulate it pretty strictly. The idea of that stuff has always horrified me but when I was a kid I was taught that these days its the equivalent of adding weights to their legs or making them feel slightly annoying during training. Granted, my old mare was a washout from big showtime and she was just my trail baby but I grew up around a lot of the biggest names in the industry over the last 3 decades and I never once witnessed a single animal neglected or abused. No sores, no off behavior, no malnutrition or unsavory conditions.

Again, I'm too out of the loop to really speak to the show circuit as a whole, but that seems like a stereotype to me. I have never seen the behavior or signs of an abused animal from a walking horse in training, and I can only imagine someone amateur or desperate would try historical methods of 'encouraging' their gaited horse."

A rural pastor had trouble getting hold of enough money for church roof repairs. So the parish comes up with the idea to pool their money and buy a race horse. The collection is done, and when the pastor goes shopping, he only has enough for a donkey. Nonetheless he buys the donkey and enters it into the race. It places third.

The headlines run: ""*Pastor's Ass shows!!*"" Encouraged, he runs it a second time. this time it comes in first.

The headlines announce: *""Pastor's Ass out in front.""*

The Bishop is a little worried and talks to the pastor. He reluctantly gives the donkey over to the care of the local nunnery.

The headlines declare **""Mother Superior has best ass in town.""**

The Bishop chokes on his morning coffee and tells the Mother Superior to do something about it. Not having any other alternative, she sets the donkey free.

**""Mother Superior says her ass is wild and free!!""** is splashed across the front pages.

The Bishop starts a course of blood pressure medication and orders the donkey to be captured.

***""Bishop wants Mother Superior's ass!!!""*** scream the papers.

The Bishop is hospitalized. The donkey is caught ultimately and a picture of the pastor riding the donkey is published on the front page: ***""Pastor rides Mother Superior's Ass into town""***

The Bishop's funeral is on Sunday morning.

(OK, it's about a donkey, but it's the first joke I thought of.)"

They're the easiest to put logos/names/designs on.  They're also relatively inexpensive and can fit a wide range of horses, so they're a popular item to award at shows (often with the show and/or title embroidered on them).  I guess I can see how that would make them a popular status symbol even when they're not actually an award."

1- people say that their horses are afraid of mules so the mules shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to compete. To that I say, I‚Äôve seen more horses spooking at small ponies than mules, and I‚Äôve been at a lot of shows with mules. Should ponies be banned too? 

2- people get pissed when a mule beats them, and I mean BIG PISSED. Especially when they‚Äôre at a recognized Dressage show.

The initial ride was really promising as the mule was absolutely fearless (as you'd expect) and didn't shy from the lance or dummies or strike noises at all, but last I checked they still hadn't done anything with him. I think partly that's because they needed a specialty saddle for him (mule shoulders!) and had to send off for it, but I'm not sure if there's anything else stopping him.

Personally I'd think a minor league system for football would provide a better alternative. Want to play sports professionally? Go to the minor league. Want to play sports inbetween classes? Go to college.
But that'll never happen unless we're magically in a perfect world. And even then, I'd entertain the argument that student athletes  should be paid.

2727,2020-12-11 04:08:43,kajl5r,"Right? Sometimes a horse is just gonna spook. Maybe at a ghost (it's right there in the name, after all). You just never know. ""Hmmm, there is that broom that has been in that corner every day for my entire horsey life. What if IT'S ALIVE!?!"""
2728,2020-12-11 04:19:47,kajl5r,"That's exactly what I had in the 2000s. My old mare was championship bloodlines but momma stepped on her hoof when she was a foal and my uncle sold her to me for the stud fee. I did the plantation pleasure and show circuit here in FL and it was wonderful, my trainer was a professional farrier and corrected her hoof and we had a blast. Such beautiful animals without having to torture or sore them. Smoothest ride around.

I grew up riding jumpers and barrel racers and all kinds down here when I first got the bug. So I'm going to say it folks - f**k trotting! (jk don't kill me)"
2729,2020-12-11 04:31:49,kajl5r,"You obviously love these horses a lot. I think people like us, who truly love animals and whose families and friends feel the same, have a special call to look out for them. Most especially the breeds or sports we are most passionate about. We can use our experience to be a more authoritative voice for them. We can adopt them and help them find some happiness. There's always so much to do. (And agreed, I could never be a vet either. The [suicide rate](https://todaysveterinarybusiness.com/cdc-reports-elevated-suicide-rates-for-veterinarians/) in the profession is terribly high. It hurts to think about these things, but it hurts far more to confront them directly.)

Someone passionate about greyhounds got me into the breed and now I do my best to influence laws protecting them, through donation and advocacy, until I can adopt one of my very own. A rescue, naturally!    I hope everyone who loves the breed like you can advocate for them, so that the Senate will finally get PAST into federal law."

2736,2020-12-11 22:51:22,kajl5r,"Smooth is right! Nothing else like that running walk. It was my boy's preferred gait to get around all the time. Like you with your girl, I got him as a youngun for cheap (family friend bred their mare to a stud and decided to sell the colt to us for little to nothing). He had that TWH natural rhythm thing where he would swing his head and jingle his bit in time with his walk. I always thought that was so cute. What a character he was.

May future horses never know the pain of those old ""methods."""

Now that sounds like a joke about cross-dressing and fancy dress, and if I were more skilled I could probably fashion it into one. But seriously, a drag race is where the organisers drag a bag of aniseed across the ground where they want the dogs to go. The dogs follow the scent, and none of the riders need to know what course they‚Äôre following.

All the tradition, all the fun, all of the skill of riding over hazards without having a chance to practice, and no animal cruelty."
2740,2020-12-13 12:25:36,kajl5r,"You know, the *Man versus Horse Marathon* really missed the mark by not having the marathon runners dress in fox suits."

2744,2020-12-14 18:17:05,kajl5r,There‚Äôs a class in the Arabian horse world where they dress up like Bedouins and the horses have bells on. Not sure what it‚Äôs called but it‚Äôs pretty cool to watch.

2746,2020-12-13 16:22:17,kajl5r,"Have they yet gotten behind not hunting actual foxes, or do they only do it begrudgingly?"
2747,2020-12-13 21:29:40,kajl5r,"Well I did actually have to google this, because I don‚Äôt live anywhere near a hunt, I don‚Äôt know anyone who hunts, and so I really don‚Äôt know any more than you.

Apparently, despite hunting with dogs being illegal, there are various ways around this and hunting continues to be a problem. But the media know it‚Äôs a sure-fire popular topic to point and laugh at the rich, so it‚Äôs *possible* the extent of it is over-reported. It would be difficult for a layperson to tell the difference between a hunt and a drag, and all the press would have to do is print a rumour with a photo of a drag."
2748,2020-12-18 17:54:55,kajl5r,"Nope.

To my knowledge, there are no legitimate drag racing hunts in the UK. Even the ones that are advertised as being drag racing only still create animal casualties in the form of the dogs, horses and other wildlife that comes across their path. In essence, there's very little chance of doing damage to *something* if you're thundering 30 hounds and 80 odd horses across the countryside. Hounds that are still somewhat trained to chase and hunt down smaller furry mammals."

- she is a recognizable brand ambassador for the throngs of retail investors who don't know any better.
  
- she has access to all of her sponsors and corporate partners for potential targets or additional cash.
  
- she started Serena Ventures, which has invested in 50 startups over 6 years. The portfolio is worth at least $10mil and focuses on businesses started by women and minorities.
  - she is part owner of the Miami Dolphins and UFC."

2815,2020-12-23 00:44:33,kihcus,"[Here you go](https://de.linkfang.org/wiki/Expletivum): It's the Expletivum!  
It doesn't really have semantic meaning but German syntax requires it in some circumstances. The verb goes second in declarative sentences so something must go in front of it. If you decide not to put the subject or an object you can add a semantically empty ""es"" in the initial position to satisfy that requirement. 

It's really a stylistic thing as the meaning of the sentence doesn't change:  
 ""Es spielen im Finale Venus und Serena Williams"" means exactly the same thing as the first sentence, just flipped around with the ""es"" at the beginning. That way you don't end up with ""Spielen im Finale Venus und Serena Williams"", which would sound like a yes/no question"
2816,2020-12-23 06:33:19,kihcus,"German grammar sources call it Expletivum, but I think the analogous English concept would be the provisional subject. The structures don't really overlap exactly though, and I believe the Expletivum in German tends to be a little more flexible.

German syntax normally involves placing topics at the beginning of the sentence without many exceptions. However, there are sentences where you want to avoid making *any* concept the explicit topic, and that's where the Expletivum comes into play. The ""real"" subject remains as such, because the verb remains declined for the proper form (""Venus und Serena **spielen**), but this subject is allowed to appear later in the sentence, and even later than other adverbial information like ""im Finale""."
2817,2020-12-23 00:37:13,kihcus,"Reminds me of the use of it in English :

That Serena and venus play tennis is great

It is great that Serena and venus play tennis

I'm not exactly sure what this construction is called.
Edit: the it is used in an anticipatory manner. Looking for anticipatory use of es I found [this](https://grammar.collinsdictionary.com/amp/german-easy-learning/use-of-es-as-an-anticipatory-object)"
2818,2020-12-23 00:33:15,kihcus,"I think it's impersonal passive:

2819,2020-12-23 00:12:42,kihcus,"Es ist das Finale, Venus und Serena werden spielen?

2820,2020-12-23 00:47:24,kihcus,Awesome! Thank you so much. I was really scratching my head trying to figure out what this was.
2821,2020-12-24 19:32:28,kihcus,Thank you for the explanation! I have unknowingly used and seen it before in other contexts but had no explanation of how it is constructed or when. This helps.
2822,2020-12-23 00:46:00,kihcus,"I initially thought that's what this is as well, but the verb isn't conjugated for 'Es' it remains conjugated for the subject of the sentence which is not in first position. In impersonal passive the verb is conjugated for the es because it is in fact the subject."
2823,2020-12-22 22:31:16,kifmqz,amazing job girls! we all killed it! congrats my S1 girls for taking the top 2 spot! mwah mwah!
2824,2020-12-22 23:56:08,kifmqz,what a great episode! season one stays slaying
2825,2020-12-23 00:07:12,kifmqz,I‚Äôm giggling üòå
2826,2020-12-23 20:44:07,kifmqz,this was a fun ep
2827,2020-12-22 22:51:17,kifmqz,I don't like you anymore xx
2828,2020-12-23 21:06:38,kifmqz,OG queens üíû
2829,2020-12-23 21:07:31,kifmqz,I feel like you are the Merle of the panel
2830,2020-12-23 21:05:14,kifmqz,omg you commented!!! It is a rare but celebratory occasion
2831,2020-12-23 01:42:11,kich38,"So it's confirmed that Sasha was injured at Rostelecom. (Alena too?)
Anyway, good thing they are talking about limiting her quads though. She really doesn't need so many right now."
2832,2020-12-22 20:59:56,kich38,"He's fired *17* coaches already? Maybe it's not them, but you. Why does this remind me of someone who once said ""I'm going to get all the best people..."" üòÇ"
2833,2020-12-22 21:57:36,kich38,"did we hear something new? 

his business partner Ari Zaharyan lamenting the lost money Trusova and Kostornaia could have made when properly managed?

Plushy will probably only be sorry he was unable to monetize his assets"
2834,2020-12-23 15:26:03,kich38,"Say what you want about his personality but I admire his philosophy, his attitude, and his willingness to make even private training more accessible. Access to coaching is the difference between stagnation and excellence for a lot of children."
2835,2020-12-22 22:03:00,kich38,I thought Olympic athletes all had to be amateurs. Is that no longer true?
2836,2020-12-22 23:55:31,kich38,"Well, say what you want about this man but he sure knows how to work the PR machine"
2837,2020-12-23 05:07:13,kich38,"Let her jump 4 quads being injured (even lightly) on not very important tournament. WTF. That's so stupid. I think he is not lying, she've pointed to her taped leg when she've talked with Mozalev during gala. I hope both Sasha and Plushy will learn from this failure."
2838,2020-12-23 02:05:58,kich38,"Didnt  they change that back in the 90s?

Plenty of pros (hockey, basketball, possibly baseball) have participated in the Olympics.

I know for figure skating they were allowing pros to reinstate beginning with the 94  Olympic Games (Boitano, Browning, Torvill/Dean, G&G, Witt, and I forget who else did for that cycle)

I‚Äôm pretty sure there are rules about how they make their money to remain ISU and Olympic eligible, but I don‚Äôt know the specifics anymore."

2840,2020-12-31 01:28:04,khxvuu,Hello thank you for your comment. So I‚Äôm currently at 45k annual. If you‚Äôre in my shoes would you leave the 45k and start this route instead?
