2,2020-02-05 07:49:44,ez5e4v,They are both saying the Nicki Minaj is Ncuti‚Äôs celebrity crush.
3,2020-02-05 06:50:04,ez5e4v,"the quality is so bad, im srry. i screenrecorded this frm twitter"
4,2020-02-05 07:27:28,ez5e4v,edit: they were playing a bff challenge.
5,2020-02-05 07:50:24,ez5e4v,"I already corrected this in the comments and they‚Äôre saying icon, not crush."
6,2020-02-05 04:39:56,ez1ygf,She should enter Soca Monarch.
7,2020-02-06 02:02:43,ez1ygf,Keep her. We doh want she here.
8,2020-02-06 18:54:19,ez1ygf,Nicki Minaj the one who thinks jamaican accent is trini

12,2020-02-05 00:05:26,eyzvri,That‚Äôs... just not a good line
13,2020-02-05 00:32:17,eyzvri,"The bars you listed here are pretty mild, I wouldn‚Äôt consider them very controversial. Eminem‚Äôs columbine line from 20 years ago was way worse and he also rapped about ripping Pamela Lee‚Äôs tits off in one of his biggest radio hits lol. It‚Äôs just now with social media, 5 offended people on Twitter ignites a response from the media to generate clicks. These are not truly controversial bars."
14,2020-02-05 00:26:04,eyzvri,She straight up stole the switch like from Nas
15,2020-02-05 00:59:23,eyzvri,just reminds me of the outkast song. also this is clearly a sensationalist post to bring attention to the nicki snippet cause no one outisde of a small irrelavant fraction of the internet has said anything about that line

89,2020-02-04 09:50:10,eyjfj2,Is Pills n Potions more meaningful or interesting than songs where she's flexing? I like the song but 'I'm sad so I'm doing drugs' is a really common theme in songs so it's hardly new and exciting
90,2020-02-04 04:44:28,eyjfj2,...why
91,2020-02-04 04:21:27,eyjfj2,what is there to bounce back from? megatron was fun

96,2020-02-04 06:28:53,eyjfj2,"Nicki has a weird obsession with Anna Nicole Smith...

105,2020-02-04 06:34:08,eyjfj2,did your phone/computer autocorrect Megatron or is this one of those stan thing where people type things wrong on purpose? Cos I honestly don't get this one.
106,2020-02-04 17:18:11,eyjfj2,this sounds nothing like a migos track

108,2020-02-04 13:49:41,eyjfj2,That's even less likely considering the Migos are Cardis friends/husband.
109,2020-02-04 05:42:53,eyjfj2,"Sure, and fans are allowed to criticize the music and not listen to it. Its not all about blind stanning. You can‚Äôt force yourself to like somebody‚Äôs new music. They‚Äôre just gonna get fake fans who don‚Äôt actually listen to the music. 

Nicki‚Äôs made it extremely clear that she cares a lot about getting a #1 album, so she should be doing fanservice."
110,2020-02-04 04:23:19,eyjfj2,"At her stage it is somewhat fan service. For smaller artists it doesn‚Äôt really matter, but for someone as big as Nicki it‚Äôs pretty important that she listens to what her fans want. Especially bc she‚Äôs made it clear that she still cares about charts, sales, Grammys, etc"
111,2020-02-04 03:33:59,eyjfj2,"I really just don't understand this sentiment. Nicki is already one of the greats. After all her success and accolades, why do people still feel like she has to prove herself? Yes, I agree that she has even more potential, but that doesn't diminish what she has already accomplished."
112,2020-02-04 03:26:53,eyjfj2,"Well put some respect on her name. She is one of the greats and she has put in that type of effort, I‚Äôm just saying this song from the snippet doesn‚Äôt sound anywhere close to her best"
113,2020-02-04 06:37:21,eyjfj2,">This is it. Nicki Minaj has the potential to be one of the greats and she just doesn‚Äôt try for it at all.

But Nicki *is* one of the great, point blank period. Does she live up to her greatness with these tracks? It's debatable, but don't front like any of the girls can do it like Nicki lmao

I don't say it as a Nicki stan, but only Nicki can be placed with the guys. (Sad but lbr)"
114,2020-02-04 15:26:46,eyjfj2,"Yes, Ganja Burn was my favorite song from the album. It captures the Queen aesthetic perfectly."
115,2020-02-04 11:07:53,eyjfj2,...because the song is called Yikes

She‚Äôs already had commercial success. And I wish she‚Äôd cement herself as an artist who says something, stands for something, tells a story, pushes the genre in a certain direction. She doesn‚Äôt need to prove herself commercially anymore, so why not serve undoubted quality?"
130,2020-02-04 08:51:00,eyjfj2,"Yeah she's achieved a lot. No denying, but I feel it's about time to move on to that potential we see. It's frustrating that she isn't progressing."
131,2020-02-04 08:51:12,eyjfj2,Commercial success has nothing to do with music quality. She has one killer verse of MBDTF and that‚Äôs it. Her music is average pop music. She‚Äôs not ‚Äúone of the greats‚Äù.
132,2020-02-04 03:31:14,eyjfj2,">She is one of the greats and she has put in that type of effort.

period period period"
133,2020-02-04 20:19:28,eyjfj2,"""I'm not much of a drinker"""
134,2020-02-04 12:47:21,eyjfj2,"She was a super famous Guess and Playboy model in the 90s, famous because she was the first plus sized (or curvier) model to be in those ads (she lost a lot of weight towards the end due to taking a plethora of pills). She also styled herself to look like a Marilyn Monroe type sexpot 24/7. She was quite... eccentric. She ended up marrying a 90-something year old multi-billionaire oil tycoon and he died thirteen months later without even consummating the marriage (making her one history's most famous ""gold diggers""). She also had her own reality show on E! wayyy before Keeping up with the Kardashians and even before The Simple Life (her show basically paved the way for others, even if hers was the hot mess version).

She was just very brazen and basically did whatever the fuck she wanted. She took a lot of pills towards the end due to a tragic last few months (her teenage son OD'd and died the same week she gave birth to her daughter and she never recovered, dying 4 months later). She was 39.

If any of that seems like something Nicki would glorify, then there ya go. (And since  Nicki's real name is Onika, which kind of sounds similar to Anna Nicole, I wouldn't be surprised if she felt some sort of connection to her growing up).

edit: ~~Nikki~~  Nicki, my bad"
135,2020-02-04 12:42:57,eyjfj2,"I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a specific one tbh. However, Nicki could have found her a niche to be a metaphor/simile for dead career or something...I mean it is common to write such thing in rap songs

Also Nicki has been in the game for more than a decade, so she could have some regular materials, like ‚Äúthese bitches is my sons‚Äù and it‚Äôs 1000000 alternatives (sadly haven‚Äôt been used much recently), she probably just found Anna came in clutch when she needs some vivid portrayal for death/dead career

Nicki, in fact, knows her thing pretty well and she reuses her materials. For example, Harriet Tubman has actually been on her mind since 2009 in ‚ÄúBeam me up Scotty‚Äù: ‚ÄúBaddest underground since Harriet Tub‚Äù"
136,2020-02-04 12:32:44,eyjfj2,Please explain...
137,2020-02-04 07:10:19,eyjfj2,Yeah Australian Koori you?
138,2020-02-04 10:34:32,eyjfj2,that's why I said assuming lol I just did it for fun
139,2020-02-04 17:33:03,eyjfj2,Places you took me: there. Please tell me there's a video of someone in a clown suit dancing to Chun-Li while squeezing their clown nose to the horns. I can't get this image out of my head lmao.
140,2020-02-04 22:17:17,eyjfj2,Tbh I feel like basically everything people say they want from her is stuff she‚Äôs already given us on The Pinkprint
141,2020-02-04 12:35:35,eyjfj2,"I think that she serves quality. Nowadays everybody needs to stand for something, have a political view, etc... But Nicki isn't about that, she's an egocentric woman that makes songs for her own ego or just to chill (that's what I like about her)"
142,2020-02-04 11:36:40,eyjfj2,"please. any female rapper worth anything these days respects nicki and more often than not, cites her as an inspiration. her flow, her look, her attitude is bitten off by alot of people and thats perfectly fine.

along with that, it‚Äôs incredibly impressive that to this day, nicki still manages to be as successful as she is. nicki has proven herself commercially AND she has proven her talent. she doesn‚Äôt need to make ‚Äúall things go‚Äù or ‚Äúbed of lies‚Äù with every single to be one of the greats cause she already is"
143,2020-02-04 13:44:22,eyjfj2,"A decade of enormous success and relevance says a lot about the quality of her music. Unfortunately for Nicki, the hip-hop community is misogynistic and hates crossover appeal. So despite being one of the greats, she will never get the credit she deserves and people will always think she has something to prove because they can't stand that the same person who wrote Monster is also out there singing Superbass."
144,2020-02-04 16:41:57,eyjfj2,why did i think anna nicole smith was that child pagent queen that was found dead in her basement
145,2020-02-04 15:41:10,eyjfj2,Nikki
146,2020-02-04 13:28:18,eyjfj2,"This sub doesn't have the best track record when it comes to racism, sadly."
147,2020-02-04 07:10:49,eyjfj2,Native American :)
148,2020-02-04 10:38:45,eyjfj2,That‚Äôs fair! Sorry if that came off in a dick-ish tone.
149,2020-02-04 22:41:18,eyjfj2,if there isn‚Äôt one i will do it because holy shit that‚Äôs hilarious
150,2020-02-05 03:18:12,eyjfj2,"This. I get tired of people saying all Nicki raps about is her pussy. Like that journalist who said Nicki needed to find another direction, like obviously she never listened to pinkprint."
151,2020-02-04 12:49:42,eyjfj2,"On one hand, she doesn‚Äôt need to say something politically. What does 1989 or Melodrama say politically? Even Lemonade is light on politics. She just hasn‚Äôt made something fully introspective, which to me is important as an artist.

On the other hand, rap is a sociopolitical movement. It stared because people‚Äôs voices were being suppressed. It grew from an oppressive environment. So there‚Äôs somewhat of an argument to be made that if you want to be an actual rapper, you should stand for something. There‚Äôs a lot of ways to make a good rap song ‚Äî be a storyteller, be a great producer, be funny, clever word play. But to be a great rap artist is something else."
152,2020-02-04 11:45:59,eyjfj2,"...I‚Äôm not saying she isn‚Äôt an inspiration, but she hasn‚Äôt made a magnum opus and she should to cement a legacy. That‚Äôs it."
153,2020-02-05 10:37:53,eyjfj2,"I don‚Äôt hate her because she‚Äôs female, I think her music is cookie cutter shit. There are lots of better female MC‚Äôs out there to pick from."
154,2020-02-04 22:26:53,eyjfj2,"weirdly, there are a number of similarities between the two 

the general air of exploitation surrounding them, for one"
155,2020-02-04 07:13:53,eyjfj2,"Ohh awesome! Would love to visit one day, haha"
156,2020-02-04 11:11:21,eyjfj2,"No no, you're good. I'm not offended, just prideful"
157,2020-02-04 12:51:42,eyjfj2,You got a point there!
158,2020-02-04 11:46:49,eyjfj2,what are you even saying? she already has cemented her legacy.
159,2020-02-04 09:22:09,eyjfj2,Native America is a beautiful place!
160,2020-02-04 11:48:52,eyjfj2,"When you think of Nicki Minaj‚Äôs art, what do you think? Her pussy and these bitches being her sons. She hasn‚Äôt said anything worth mentioning. 

It‚Äôs fine. You think commercial success equates to artistry. Your disagreement has been noted; I don‚Äôt owe you a debate."
161,2020-02-04 11:53:50,eyjfj2,"she doesn‚Äôt need to preach about current issues or speak about her life in her music to have a legacy. 

when i think of nicki‚Äôs art, i think of the fact she‚Äôs an insanely talented rapper who‚Äôs animation and extensive wordplay which has made its mark on the rap genre. she dared to be inventive and experimental when not even the popstars would. who else has a song as experimental and batshit as roman holiday? not even gaga does. 

and no, i don‚Äôt think commercial success equates to artistry otherwise i would think cardi b has a single good song lol"
162,2020-02-05 03:53:15,eyjfj2,You sound a whole lot like the boomers on r/music who gatekeep ‚Äúreal artists‚Äù
163,2020-02-04 11:56:39,eyjfj2,Okay.
164,2020-02-05 03:57:35,eyjfj2,Cardi B has many good songs.
165,2020-02-04 12:37:13,eyjfj2,Nicki's videography is unique. Cardi Who doesn't have a single MV memorable
166,2020-02-05 06:07:20,eyjfj2,Okay
167,2020-02-04 13:16:34,eyjfj2,"This is the first time I'm hearing this, tbh. I'm not a big fan of either one of them but I constantly see Cardi being praised for her visuals. The MVs for Press and Money outright elevated the tracks."

188,2020-03-27 17:03:25,fq0ohz,Travis has been falling off for a long time now. Hope he will be able to make a comeback since jackboys wasnt really well received either. lets just say that 2020 really is'nt his year yet...

195,2020-03-27 17:58:32,fq0ohz,i actually like all of travs albums im just not a braindead zombie that likes everything with the name travis scott on it

198,2020-03-27 17:56:24,fq0ohz,I'm just saying how can you say he is falling off based on a couple of features which arent even bad. All through his career his best work has been on his solo stuff
199,2020-03-27 18:01:25,fq0ohz,"Im saying that based on my opinion. Imo songs like Texas cyclone, turks, hop off a jet etc. Is kinda mid in contrast to what he used to do."

229,2020-03-27 02:04:11,fpoenl,We know Yara kills this and Kenya would prob do better here than snatch game because Yara would edit the jokes and Kenya could also do punchlines as well which is the only thing that yara's team lacked in the original format. Pep and tkb both killed the Challanges that they had to write jokes to so they could do well but there characterization was so far off that I still see them bombing like snatch. Dusty and adore would do well tbh. Bendela and Chi Chi both have easy punchlines and could do really well. I see pearl and Farrah as like Latrilla in the og with Pearl killing it and Farrah doing terrible. Delta and Roxxxy I see doing like Rujubee with Roxxxy doing really well and Delta doing ok but missing some of the character but just sets Roxxxy up for jokes.

YOU KNOW IVE BEEN A BOSS MY WHOLE CAREER"
308,2020-04-19 20:53:20,g4ex7k,Only good western collabs are BTS World OST's ones because the other artsist are really a part of the song.Unfortunately they didn't get a promotion they deserve.
309,2020-04-19 21:11:04,g4ex7k,and on ft sia was just freaking awful.
310,2020-04-19 22:43:41,g4ex7k,"I honestly love Halsey in BWL, i think it takes the song to another level of poppy deliciousness. But when i hear Nicki's opening bars on Idol i lose my mind. I don't know if it's technically good, but it's so campy and ridiculous that I can't help but love it."
311,2020-04-19 21:27:56,g4ex7k,"Okay in terms of what they brought to the table Nicki obviously outdid Halsey. Her being in the song was just whatever she didn‚Äôt add anything. I was expecting her to play a bigger part in the song since she was listed a feature.

I do not know why they are so stuck on working with that girl like yes they are friends okay I get that. Her music is just not all that and I say that as someone who liked Badlands. I never like their collaborations because I don‚Äôt think the people they work with make good musicüíÄLike why don‚Äôt they work with charli xcx more she‚Äôs their friend. What ever happened with them doing stuff with Zedd? They‚Äôre killing me here!

Still think BWL is the better song just because I hate idol and even nicki couldn‚Äôt save it for me."
312,2020-04-19 20:59:53,g4ex7k,"I agree with you somehow, it sounds more like BTS gave Halsey a part of their song to sing, rather than Halsey cutting out for herself a space in the song. As for the reason why they promoted Halsey more, in my opinion it could be for two different reasons, depending on whether you're for the ""idols are mostly real"" team or the ""idols are mostly fake"" team:

a) BTS and Halsey, as opposed to BTS and Nicki, are friends, which also explains why they would go out of their way to perform with each other, be interviewed together, and spend time together even when off camera. I would way more motivated to promote a song if I had worked on it with a friend, rather than with someone else, no matter how popular they are. The collab with Nicki was clearly made for business rather than BTS and Nicki Minaj being actual friends, and the same can be said for Sia, so it makes sense for them to be less interested in promoting them compared to Halsey.

b) BTS and Halsey chose on mutual accord to promote the song as friends for their audience, faking to have an actual friendship with each other for the sake of publicity. The fans of Halsey get to know BTS and get the Halsey Approval that BTS are good people, the fans of BTS get to know Halsey and get the BTS Approval that Halsey is a good person. They could also have done this as a consequence to the collab with Nicki being noticed to be a pure business deal rather than something made for the sake of music: maybe they thought that the opinion would be different if they were to make the collab look more genuine? I don't know. Since the collab for ON with Sia was treated the same as the one with Nicki, it probably didn't work as well as they expected it to.

&#x200B;

~~^((also: everyone is problematic))~~"
313,2020-04-19 22:00:34,g4ex7k,"HARD AGREE. Nikki minaj part sounded like on of those songs from early 2010s. I liked it 

Honestly the only good collabs have been with steve aoki and chicken noodle soup. More groups should collab with Aoki man he makes good kpop songs imo."
314,2020-04-19 20:50:58,g4ex7k,we can all agree that On ft Sia <<<<<<<<<
315,2020-04-20 02:59:56,g4ex7k,"Nicki's collab with BTS was better but they never promoted the song together and were never seen together (someone please correct me if I'm wrong) so it doesn't get as much attention. With BWL, Halsey and BTS did several interviews where they mentioned one another and they actually preformed together, and it looks like they have an actual friendship so it got more attention. But both collabs were way better than On with Sia, which is a shame cause I was excited for it."
316,2020-04-19 22:23:52,g4ex7k,period
317,2020-04-19 22:44:24,g4ex7k,"Going to have to disagree. Nicki Minaj's verse added nothing to the song and the messaging is not even in keeping with the message of the song. Yes she sounded good but it didn't really fit when you listen to what she is saying.

Halsey sounds good in BWL and since it's a fluff song doesn't detract from the messaging of the song. I really think as someone said in another response that the BTS World collabs have been the more successful ones.

The best though would be Mic Drop the Steve Aoki remix and the worst one would be the Desiigner Mic Drop collab. Not only is his rap not great but it was a travesty to completely remove JHope's verse from the song."
318,2020-04-19 22:00:01,g4ex7k,I just generally wish bighit took collabs more seriously rather than heres a line or two
319,2020-04-19 21:35:57,g4ex7k,"Upvoted for unpopular but disagree. Halsey‚Äôs voice meshes well with BTS‚Äô vocal line. BWL and Don‚Äôt Need Your Love by NCT Dream and HVRY are the only two western collabs I‚Äôve heard where all parties feel like an organic part of the song. Nicki Minaj, as is the case with most western collabs, appears randomly out of nowhere and takes me out of the song. She‚Äôs talented for sure but her rap does not add anything to the song. At best, it‚Äôs just there. At worst, it actively drags the song down. I‚Äôd much rather listen to the original version of Idol than the collab version."
320,2020-04-20 02:04:37,g4ex7k,"My issue with Halsey was that it felt so...unlike her. Like BWL did not fit her in any way, shape or form and the whole collab felt so contrived. Like...you're gonna tell me that the same girl that made Badlands is now dancing with a boyband in a bubblegum pop song? She just seemed so out of place and it felt like I was watching something out of High School Musical.

Nicki's concept and the concept of Idol was a perfect fit- her music and visuals tend to be loud and colourful and Idol was literally the pinnacle of loud and colourful."
321,2020-04-20 03:51:12,g4ex7k,Why didn‚Äôt nicki and BTS perform together??
322,2020-04-20 03:54:36,g4ex7k,I love boy with luv üò≠üòÇ
323,2020-04-20 07:43:53,g4ex7k,I hate bwl and Halsey ruined it.
324,2020-04-20 09:22:10,g4ex7k,Dream glow>>>>>> all the rest
325,2020-04-19 21:33:04,g4ex7k,"What I appreciated about IDOL was that they gave us two studio versions of the song, one with Nicki and one without (something they did again with ON which I liked; and I'm thankful for it too, because the Sia collab was definitely not it). So we can choose whichever we wanna listen to. Whereas, unfortunately, they gave us only one version of BWL, the one with Halsey.

Tbh, I'm not a huge fan of kpop groups x western artists collabs. From the ones I know, I liked Mic Drop because Aoki created the remix and BTS sang it. There was no vocal involvement from someone outside of the group."
326,2020-04-20 00:17:44,g4ex7k,Definitely agree. I actually like Nicki's verse.
327,2020-04-20 04:01:38,g4ex7k,"Halsey is problematic? I've never heard that before.

I like both songs but I like the composition of the NM feature better. A full verse and then done - much cleaner. 

We can all agree that BWL ft Halsey > ON ft Sia though right?"
328,2020-08-25 16:12:41,g4ex7k,"I LOVE BTS. BEEN A FAN FOR 7 YEARS. I love Halsey and have been a fan for years. I love Nicki Minaj been a barb for a long time. I love both songs. I can't listen to boy with luv.. ever again because my 4 yr old sister non-stop would play it and it drove me crazy. Halsey didn't add much to the song. Not even in the Spotify version where she sang more. I love Halsey's voice and would have loved a lot more from her but I don't have a problem with it. Now Idol...WAS DOPE AS HECK!!, Nicki slayed that despite the fact that she said "" if he looks good throw my pants in the air"", lol. that's the only line I don't like and they seem like they really like her and LOVEEEEEE Halsey. The mic drop collab with Steve Aoki and Desiigner was..... there are no words to describe how HORRIBLE IT WAS. lol, hate to sound like a hater but Desiigner don't be talking bout nun and he actually cannot rap. I love steve Aoki tho. I think he was making the beat even more awesome and the video more fire than it was.  dream glow collab with Charli XCX was awesome and that song is beautiful. I can't play BTS World anymore because it drove me crazy but it was fun for a while. it just got too complicated and I'm already bad at games. Rm and wale change WAS AWESOMEEEEEEEEEE. On with Sia is... just. meh. nothing really was good about whatever the heck she was saying and Sia has some talent so I expected something outgoing and Extra from her. who with Lauv. BEAUTIFUL. I absolutely love Lauv and he is really talented. Make it right with Lauv. I love this version more because like I said he has so much talent. Add all of BTS's talent and Lauv's. makes the perfect song. that song made everything right. did you catch the joke? lol.. it was corny. Seoul town road with Lil nas x was funny to me. I like all the remixes to that song better than the original and there are like a million of them.  chicken noodle soup - Jhope and Becky g. I love it. not better than the original but it was so cute. I love waste it on me with Steve Aoki. Charlie Puth and Jungkook remix of we don't talk anymore. I love the version with Selena too but I think i like this one better. Best of me with Chainsmokers.  love it, not like the original but it was dope. RM in Honne's song crying over you was awesome. loved it. those are some unpopular opinions of mine that most BTS stans and fans disagree with but HEY!, that's why it's my opinion."
329,2020-04-19 23:05:31,g4ex7k,Lol I heard that first line in my head.
330,2020-04-19 22:40:55,g4ex7k,Yeah we don't talk about that horrendous collab
331,2020-04-20 01:47:48,g4ex7k,"On was such a gross misuse of Sia‚Äôs vocals. Sia is a world-class singer that thrives in slower paced songs which she can really belt out (Chandalier, Dusk till Dawn, Elastic Heart etc.) and On just wasn‚Äôt that. Seemed like there was more concern about putting a ‚Äúbig, western, name‚Äù into the next comeback instead of actually **A.** Finding the right singer for the song OR **B.** Writing a song that utilized Sia‚Äôs vocals better."
332,2020-04-20 02:40:51,g4ex7k,I will act like that collab never exists.
333,2020-04-20 09:01:16,g4ex7k,Sia is a great singer but her voice sounds so out of place in the song. It‚Äôs a skip for me.
334,2020-04-20 08:40:24,g4ex7k,I have already forgotten this exists
335,2020-04-19 22:07:51,g4ex7k,I heard she helped writing/producing since that is what she prefers doing
336,2020-04-20 04:12:46,g4ex7k,that's subjective though. i personally don't think charli xcx makes great music üòÖüòÖ
337,2020-04-20 09:01:12,g4ex7k,i respectfully disagree with the part about nicki ruining songs. i love all her verses and they make a song better imo
338,2020-04-20 08:17:31,g4ex7k,Doing God's work
339,2020-04-20 09:24:48,g4ex7k,I feel like Lo Siento also works well
340,2020-04-20 01:56:10,g4ex7k,"i 100% agree. her voice sounded very distorted for one which was wrong. and she can belt out anything so to put her on this song out of any song was weird to me. just not her style. 

i could maybe see someone like Madison Beer or Miley Cyrus or Noah Cyrus singing that chorus but to add Sia was so questionable"
341,2020-04-19 22:15:04,g4ex7k,[deleted]
342,2020-04-20 02:10:28,g4ex7k,"Madison Beer or Miley Cyrus would‚Äôve been much more fitting. To add on, after reviewing the album track list, Louder Than Bombs looks like it would‚Äôve been the perfect song if they wanted to feature Sia, it would have fit her concept very well and allowed her to sing the way she does."
343,2020-04-19 22:17:41,g4ex7k,Well I guess she didn't then. Probably heard bs
344,2020-04-20 02:14:55,g4ex7k,"when i had first listened to On ft Sia i was so shocked. like it was really bad and i genuinely was like- shocked. i didn‚Äôt think it would be that bad but Sia was disrespected in that song. i hope people don‚Äôt just listen to that and think Sia is a bad artist. like imagine hearing of Sia for the first time and that‚Äôs what you hear :( just bad all together. maybe just maybe if she did a little add on part on the bridge with JK it would‚Äôve sounded better but her part in the chorus was just awful. they did her dirtyyyy. 

and did you notice on BTS‚Äôs spotify playlists they all have ‚ÄúOn ft Sia‚Äù as their favorite BTS track? like could BigHit be any more like idk what the word is but every single member has that as their favorite and it‚Äôs obviously not every members favorite. it‚Äôs just for advertising purposes i get it but it‚Äôs just bad. BigHit was shameful for that IMO. Sia‚Äôs management messed up too."

403,2020-05-03 06:44:32,gcjhe2,That makes sense - but they shoehorned an ad in there when she was legit in the middle of dancing. I feel like there are more opportune/appropriate moments

468,2020-05-02 23:24:28,gc8ewh,"She blew up in 2017 which is recent enough, since this rate covers 2016 rap girls and onward. ~~also she was necessary for this rate to be green lit~~"
469,2020-05-02 15:59:27,gc8ewh,YESSSS bree deserves the 11s. hopefully this rate puts more people onto her!! she‚Äôs a superstar in the making

516,2020-06-26 15:34:27,hg9l71,"The thigh pat was a little awkward, but the 'go hard, wish I could' was kind of funny. I interpreted it more as a self-deprecating joke if anything."
517,2020-06-26 15:52:09,hg9l71,"Just a heads up, the part your referencing is actually around 1:48."
518,2020-06-26 18:08:55,hg9l71,"i don‚Äôt know... maybe i‚Äôm just not sensing the perceived discomfort from her but this doesn‚Äôt seem very cringe, i‚Äôm half doubting myself saying this when comparing his age to hers - but it seemed
somewhat innocent & Nicki doesn‚Äôt seem to have an issue when it comes to declaring that she‚Äôs offended. i assume she would‚Äôve slapped the dude tbh - on the other hand, that kind of touching with someone you‚Äôre barely acquainted with is inappropriate. not sure how i feel üòê

btw, like the other guy said - the ass tap is at 1:48"
519,2020-06-27 02:56:33,hg9l71,"All that aside, the way they banter back and forth is so weird for an interview format. They don't give her time to really answer anything and a lot of the questions require single word answers, which is poor form when interviewing."

541,2020-06-26 09:56:05,hg3ijt,"It's pretty weird that she can sing well, yet most of her 'popular' songs weren't *rap,* but half-yelling singing. It probably doesn't help that she puts on a lot of stupid voices mid-song too."

Sorry but i don't just disagree with you, but I personally hate Nikki minaj"
546,2020-06-26 08:15:08,hg3ijt,Its not misogynistic whatsoever. Criticising a single woman doesn't mean i hate all women.

552,2020-06-26 19:58:53,hg3ijt,The issue is that your criticism of this one woman is steeped in misogyny

554,2020-06-26 08:18:19,hg3ijt,You have a shitty taste in music and poor judgement on character if you consider this bimbo as your queen

559,2020-06-26 22:53:15,hg3ijt,Why are you reluctant to say what musicians you like? Scared somebody will shit all over your personal preferences maybe?
560,2020-06-26 21:51:06,hg3ijt,Because clearly you‚Äôre certified to determine what is/isn‚Äôt misogynistic.

564,2020-06-26 05:12:00,hg1h00,"I'm confused because the title and the body don't seem to exactly line up for me.  


If I start a youtube career. And then later on there's a realistic photoshop which surfaces of me kicking a cat. And no matter how much I refute it, people insist on ""cancelling"" me.  


Then do you think I should feel personally responsible for the cancelling?"
565,2020-06-26 05:15:14,hg1h00,"Facing backlash is not the same thing as having coordinated attacks on your character (instead of facing criticism for your actions) by angry Twitter mobs who probably get a kick out of watching you fall and suffer. 

Cancel culture needs to fucking stop. It is mindless and has driven people to suicide. Criticism is okay (and welcomed, even) but not if your only goal is to see someone fall. That‚Äôs fucking juvenile and exactly why people are complaining about cancel culture. There is no actual character growth possible under cancel culture because you don‚Äôt have an opportunity to think or feel anything before you have millions  of people harassing you online. 

Just... stop."
566,2020-06-26 05:46:00,hg1h00,"What about when they get accused of something out of spite/hate by a person that knew him/her, it gets blown up in Twitter, and no matter how many times he/she proves that the crime never happens the mob stays there. A good example of this is the Spanish Youtuber DalasReview. He dumped his girlfriend and she got so mad that she convinced some of their friends in common or exes to accuse him of rape, pedophilia, and abuse over some screenshots taken out of context and half true testimonies (shouting during fights, texting with 19 year olds who sent him nudes that he didn‚Äôt ask for, kicking their dog when he misbehaved, kicking her out of the house a week after they broke up because it was his apartment legally and she never paid rent) They even sued him for all of this. For a year and a half he was the most hated person in the entirety of the YouTube Spain and Latin America community. He got his accounts regularly doxxed till the point that saying that this guy raped you became a hashtag and kind of a meme. He won every single trial. All of them. Even the JUDGE OF THE CASE said that she‚Äôs a feminist that specializes in cases of home abuse and that in her experience, the ex ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt look or behaved like someone that had experienced abuse‚Äù. His win was so definitive he is right now suing everyone that accused him of fraud, forgery of evidence, and conspiracy. Despite all of the previously mentioned points, he is treated like nuclear waste. No one wants to collaborate with him because his presence is toxic marketing-wise and to this day the twitter mob keeps accusing him of this crimes and spreading hate about his name. Although it is true that he commited ashole-ish behavior AT BEST. He keeps getting hate for it. Is he responsible por all that has happened to him?"
567,2020-06-26 06:27:47,hg1h00,I didn't know you could cancel a youtuber. How does this work? She surely still has fans that watch her videos and that bring her money? Aren't youtubers all independant? Why would she stop? Just cause of public pressure?
568,2020-06-26 02:38:19,hfxdnp,bro this is from 2011. Not cringe. This was considered random youtuber comedy back then.

570,2020-06-26 20:05:12,hfxdnp,It was honestly pretty cringe then too
571,2020-06-26 20:18:57,hfxdnp,"for me it was just as bad back then 

no idea how the worst youtubers get so popular"
572,2020-06-26 18:45:58,hfxdnp,"You know, I don't necessarily think it's unhealthy to bring problematic content like this up and hold those who created it accountable, but I think the level of vitriol and hatred many hold towards Jenna is very excessive considering this was almost the entire YouTube comedy scene's MO in the late 2000s/early 2010s. Her statement seemed sincere to me--and I am aware I am not the supreme arbiter of social justice or whatever, but Jesus folks at some point when are we going out of our way to demonize folks who clearly mean no harm? And I say this as someone who legitimately sees value in many aspects of cancel culture!"

586,2020-06-25 18:01:44,hfowhf,Sounds childish af. Why can‚Äôt she just get on the phone to Ye and ask? Unless she‚Äôs doing it to show there is a demand but surely Ye knows that? (It‚Äôs trended multiple times and is on a shit ton of Tik Tok videos)
587,2020-06-25 17:26:34,hfowhf,nahhhhh rather not have it released if kanye's not on it
588,2020-06-25 16:58:29,hfowhf,Why ferg tho?
589,2020-06-25 17:52:44,hfowhf,She really is a 40 years old acting like a teenager that shit is sickening.
590,2020-06-25 21:51:11,hfowhf,watch ye drop it but its jesusfied and nickis verse isn't there lol
591,2020-06-25 21:52:36,hfowhf,W but I dont think Kanye will ever drop it
592,2020-06-25 22:35:39,hfowhf,I listen to JIK New Body because Nicki isn‚Äôt on it
593,2020-06-25 23:17:59,hfowhf,XPLRNWBDY
594,2020-06-26 06:30:15,hfowhf,NEW WALK NEW TALK

596,2020-06-25 16:24:02,hfowhf,[deleted]
597,2020-06-25 19:19:28,hfowhf,She probably called him but he only spoke in beeps
598,2020-06-25 18:44:20,hfowhf,Ye's a weird dude. He probably drops communication with people out of nowhere sometimes
599,2020-06-26 00:53:01,hfowhf,Marketing bruh. It‚Äôs all a show for hype and attention.
600,2020-06-25 18:43:18,hfowhf,better than the entire song not seeing the light of day just saying
601,2020-06-25 17:00:38,hfowhf,There‚Äôs another unreleased song with Ferg that I guess she‚Äôs tryna get released
602,2020-06-25 17:55:31,hfowhf,"i mean if i got paid millions every year because of it why not ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, plus it seems like that‚Äôs just how she is"
603,2020-06-25 22:42:19,hfowhf,I hate Nicki but I think her verse is the best part of New Bory
604,2020-06-25 16:27:40,hfowhf,"If they can get this done, Nicki slander is cancelled"
605,2020-06-25 19:24:31,hfowhf,> She probably called him but he only spoke in ~~beeps~~ poop di scoops
606,2020-06-25 19:28:51,hfowhf,Ye probably is still deliberating on whether to put on his album or not maybe that why he hasn‚Äôt gave Nicki an answer?
607,2020-06-25 22:05:04,hfowhf,"Imagine she called him and ye he like ‚Äúyou have pre marital sex, so this is Jesus punishing you through me‚Äùüò≠"
608,2020-06-25 23:17:30,hfowhf,"‚ÄúBoop bop di boop bop‚Äù

-Terrance ‚ÄúPusha T‚Äù Thornton"
609,2020-06-25 19:25:22,hfowhf,"I‚Äôm not gonna listen to it if Ye isn‚Äôt on it, so whats the point. Usually just skip it after the Nicki part comes on anyway"
610,2020-06-25 23:09:28,hfowhf,oh i thought it was saying fergs on new body
611,2020-06-25 19:23:42,hfowhf,Ehhhhh I don‚Äôt know about that
612,2020-06-25 21:36:29,hfowhf,Nah she's defended multiple pedophiles
613,2020-06-25 20:17:03,hfowhf,he wanted the christian version on jik but nicki didnt wanna redo her verse so he scrapped it for that
614,2020-06-25 20:00:04,hfowhf,But the ty dolla sign verse is fat
615,2020-06-25 23:30:47,hfowhf,Gotta read these articles üòé
616,2020-06-25 19:37:41,hfowhf,I mean it is monumental for a leak to come back after it being fully spread everywhere. She killed her verse in the leaks we heard so a finished mixed and mastered version would be awesome
617,2020-06-25 22:09:01,hfowhf,Oh fuck i forgot. Slander is uncanceled
618,2020-06-25 23:16:43,hfowhf,I mean it‚Äôs not like she‚Äôs defending the pedofillia. One could argue that it‚Äôs mature of her to assess the full human rather than write someone off due to a mistake they made
619,2020-06-25 20:27:49,hfowhf,But maybe he is trying to work out a way to get that one out? If someone wants a tune he usually lets them have it but I think he still wants to put it out. It‚Äôs something he haven‚Äôt just let go on the shelf like other unreleased Ye
620,2020-06-25 20:44:49,hfowhf,Tittyfuck verse? I‚Äôm good.
621,2020-06-25 19:56:54,hfowhf,Well I mean stopping the slander not refusing a release
622,2020-06-26 06:27:37,hfowhf,get outta here jack
623,2020-06-25 22:07:09,hfowhf,yo what yall ON nicky and tys verses are so good
624,2020-06-25 20:36:24,hfowhf,"I‚Äôm explaining why slander should be canceled, at least until further fuckery"
625,2020-06-26 07:09:08,hfowhf,Maybe I‚Äôm a glass half full guy
626,2020-06-25 15:39:15,hfnxt3,"lol this author is the saltiest. How does he feel about Drake still putting out songs with Chris brown? How could he put this much effort into dissecting the morals of a shallow, gang associated shock artist and people willing to use him for clout..."

642,2020-06-25 12:31:25,hfl8pg,She‚Äôs going through a midlife crisis
643,2020-06-25 12:31:29,hfl8pg,Nicki Minaj is a piece of shit anyway it doesn't matter what she does she ruined her carreer a long time ago
644,2020-06-25 12:33:32,hfl8pg,Super bass was actually pretty decent
645,2020-06-25 09:51:22,hfi0j2,Lol 90% of her collabs are in the Rap/RnB genre.
646,2020-06-25 07:50:46,hfi0j2,the most interesting one for me is Be Careful with Ricky Martin. sounds such a great 90s song
647,2020-06-25 09:20:18,hfi0j2,"*Hard Candy* was such a shit record.

She looked at the amazing work that Justin Timberlake, Danja and Timbaland had done on *FutureSex/LoveSounds* and just forced herself into that sound, even though it didn't really work. There are like two songs that the four of them did on that record that are any good and the tracks she did with The Neptunes was just Pharrell's usual I-can't-be-bothered-copy-and-paste shit and the Kanye West feature sticks out like a sore thumb.

That having been said, I really do like ""4 Minutes"" that's a really good tune, but it doesn't really fit the vibe of her record at all. It would have been better if it was just a standalone single. Justin Timberlake should have gotten more credit for the work he did on that track. He co-wrote the track, co-produced it and did a lot of the vocal production on it too."
648,2020-06-25 10:38:34,hfi0j2,yes ng in the 90s
649,2020-06-25 09:36:00,hfi0j2,"I kind of agree with you. after the confessions success she should have settled down and looked for what was good for her. instead, she wanted to get some bite from justin's success, which was ok. During hard candy era, i did enjoy those tracks you mentioned; yet, they just did not age well. now in 2020 they sound just ""wannabe""."
650,2020-06-25 09:52:28,hfi0j2,"I found that, while it didn‚Äôt sound like a Madonna record, it was still fresh and high-quality songwriting/production. Most of the songs still sound good today. DWRY is one of her all-time best songs."

686,2020-06-30 10:43:09,hikggj,We anticipated (the fall) and they delivered (a great plummeting)
687,2020-06-30 10:08:28,hikggj,"There is something funny about watching two artists who desperately try every single tactic in the book to get a number one repeatedly fail to obtain one.

She is still yet to have a legitimate number one on her own and the one time she did achieve one, she was then disqualified from having it because her fans were way too overzealous (as they literally always are) and that fucked her out of the running.

He was almost assured of one, until Scooter Braun and his evil army of the undead strung together every dirty trick in the book to get Ariana Grande and Justin Bieber one and that denied him.

The Gods really don't want this paedophile and paedophile apologist to have a number one and it's genuinely funny to watch the increasingly bizarre ways they get denied one. 

I'm looking forward to their third collaboration being knocked off the top spot at the last moment by the Deacon Blue reunion no one is asking for or by all streaming services simultaneously going offline at the same time and there not being enough data to actually give a number one that week or something.

Christ, imagine using 6ix9ine to get a number one, that must be like using sandpaper to masturbate."
688,2020-06-30 10:29:43,hikggj,good for him. that video of him celebrating was so grating
689,2020-06-30 11:36:43,hikggj,The exclamation point LMAOO
690,2020-06-30 11:47:52,hikggj,I miss when Nicki was problematic on her own.
691,2020-06-30 12:01:25,hikggj,"OP adding the exclamation point to the headline is lowkey shady skskskssksk

This article goes to show that any random twitter stan/pophead/ATRLer could pursue a career in music journalism. While I understand that there isn't a lot to report on, using @chartdata and stan replies as legitimate sources is straight up laziness"
692,2020-06-30 11:33:20,hikggj,"A solid 40-50% of number ones in the past few years, no one is remembering them in a decade. It‚Äôs still admirable to get a number 1 with no help from the radio and no Spotify play listing. At this point 69 is arguably the fifth biggest male singer/rapper on the planet behind Drake, Post, Travis and Weeknd."
693,2020-06-30 10:13:30,hikggj,"it‚Äôs not just her though. most artists nowadays are using questionable tactics to bump their songs up the charts. billboard should do something about it because the charts are starting to lose credibility. both trollz and stuck with u did not deserve #1 and it‚Äôs embarrassing to say that they were. putting out 20+ different physical versions of a same song is not the best way to measure the song‚Äôs success and impact. and that goes to all the artists who have been doing this (ariana, justin, megan thee stallion, taylor, shawn mendes, etc)"

697,2020-06-30 12:14:03,hikggj,"thats not true. He might be good for having a quick splash and gaining a lot of momentary attention but he has no influence or longevity in the culture. I dont even mean that as a oldhead-ish argument, imo ie lil pump has a place in the culture for bringing that youthful, punk florida scene to the mainstream. But 69 doesnt have anything like this. His best songs are gentrified scream raps that arent per se bad but have no lineage. He is representing nothing but the fantasy of a lot of kids to be as succesful as u want to be while still being the most terrible human being u want to be."

700,2020-06-30 12:22:25,hikggj,"Well, everyone is gaming the charts. Nothing admirable about labels pushing their artists songs on radio and using contacts to put it in playlists or merch bundles and shit. The legit way you could tell the biggest songs are streaming numbers off YouTube and Spotify, Apple Music etc. no one listens to radio anymore but it still holds weight. Everyone is gaming the charts rn. Nothing admirable in making songs and then asking for tik tok dudes to create a dance for the song before releasing the song(like drake did for toosie slide) yet he did it."
701,2020-06-30 12:16:29,hikggj,"69 will outchart them if he got the level of support that they get. On radio, on streaming apps. Also, he‚Äôs got two top 5 hits post prison and will probably get another top 5 hit with his new song which is a Latin song. While that yummy song and the others from that album did pretty average."
702,2020-06-30 12:28:44,hikggj,"I dunno you do come off as heavily biased against him. Most of his songs have more streams than anything artists like uzi or carti or Charli xcx etc. Redditors love to be elitist twats saying ‚Äúoh but he‚Äôs only loved by kids in suburbs‚Äù or whatever you said. People on Reddit have an awful disconnect with the real world lmao. 69 has been popular for more time than lil pump, and you‚Äôre saying lil pump has a place in the culture and not 69? Lol gtfo. This is an old head argument, ‚Äúhis best songs are gentrified scream raps‚Äù also stfu, not true. His biggest songs are all while he was pretending to be gangster and hanging out with bloods. They were being bumped by almost every hood dude. ‚ÄúGentrified‚Äù my ass. Granted 69 doesn‚Äôt have many good songs, but to say he‚Äôs not relevant in the culture is just a lie."
703,2020-06-30 14:23:22,hikggj,"I think u kinda misunderstood my argument to shoehorn me into ur strawman. Ofc 69 is popular and I didnt even argue with whomst he is popular. My argument is that he won't have much legacy hence relevance in the scene cuz he lacks an original sound. That's why I brought up the pump example. People defo tried to sound like pump, his production, aesthetic and all was distinct and rooted in Florida rap tradition. I really struggle to imagine someone trying to sound like 69, you know what I mean? He had sound elements of sosmula, trippie, Pierre, some flows that he bit off carti or valee. But there will not be many musicians down the line claiming that 69 influenced their sound, cuz there basically is no 69 sound. That's my argument - I'm pretty sure that u could subtract him existing out of the development of rap music as a genre and add him back in and not the slightest thing would have changed. He isn't innovating, he is not representing stuff, hell, he isn't even featured on other people's music afaik."

711,2020-06-30 09:22:05,hiixpt,"Gonna be so interesting following him to the album launch. Like, so far he‚Äôs riding the wave of shock and controversy from his release - but there‚Äôs absolutely no substance beyond that. 

I‚Äôm saying some more momentarily hot singles in the run up to the album, then a big first week number for that, then a slow slide into commercial mediocrity thereafter. It feels like we‚Äôve seen and heard all his tricks - and he has to be much more careful this time around.

That said, his Spanish language thing will be colossal too."

Nevermind the song being good or not, we have to do whatever it takes to get our queen to the top or whatever the fuck

720,2020-06-30 11:21:28,hiixpt,Two of the least likable people in hip hop in my suburban opinion. People are tired of them.
721,2020-06-30 10:27:12,hiixpt,This is what happens when you don't put your purchased streams on a drip feed.
722,2020-06-30 09:45:24,hiixpt,Thats what happens when you only buy streams for a week
723,2020-06-30 13:17:11,hiixpt,Let me know when he dies
724,2020-06-30 10:33:41,hiixpt,"it's almost depressing that song's like Life Is Good, Whats Poppin and Watermelon Sugar, Blueberry Faygo aren't gonna go #1 whilst songs like Trollz and stuck with u did.. whilst all of those songs are gonna be much bigger songs this year than Trollz and stuck with u"
725,2020-06-30 09:15:04,hiixpt,"While not shocking, this headline shouldn't be confused with the biggest fall ever. 

There's songs by artists that have debuted top 10 then dropped off the billboard 100 completely lol"
726,2020-06-30 08:52:51,hiixpt,"6ix9ine-I know you don‚Äôt like me, u wanna fight me üòÖ"
727,2020-06-30 11:43:51,hiixpt,"It's amazing tripe like this makes it to the charts as it is, never mind about number 1."
728,2020-06-30 12:36:08,hiixpt,How did this make #1 in the first place?
729,2020-06-30 13:10:55,hiixpt,Wasn‚Äôt he just in jail and he testified that he wasn‚Äôt a real gangbanger it was just for show? And ratted everybody out. Lol how are people even listening to his music still?
730,2020-06-30 13:11:39,hiixpt,"Not trolling at all but does anyone actually ‚Äúlisten‚Äù to 69? I don‚Äôt know anyone personally who actually is a fan of his music. Again, not trolling, serious question."
731,2020-06-30 13:12:24,hiixpt,A lot of Fake Number ones due to streaming.
732,2020-06-30 13:13:29,hiixpt,"The whole video has her body filtered , look at the side of her belly on 2:00.
They slimmed the hell out of her through the whole video , she doesn't look like that"
733,2020-06-30 13:18:12,hiixpt,It died just like a meme of the week. What happens to your creative output when you do what 69 did? He can't feel good about it. He made a deal with the devil for his freedom but lost his soul. No amount of money nor views will cure that.
734,2020-06-30 13:18:24,hiixpt,Breaking another record then? W or L?
735,2020-06-30 13:25:34,hiixpt,"you already know Daniel is going to spin this into the industry being *stooopid*

*DRIP DRIP DRIP*"
736,2020-06-30 11:58:21,hiixpt,This song is a crime against hip hop
737,2020-06-30 08:37:27,hiixpt,turn this up
738,2020-06-30 11:42:14,hiixpt,This happens all the time. It‚Äôs only news cause it‚Äôs 69 and Nicki. Mf appear in the chart and then get GHOST off it all the time. 34 is still in the top 50. Some people hit #16 and then are gone lol
739,2020-06-30 12:16:32,hiixpt,Proof that snitch9 was carried by his music vids and clout
740,2020-06-30 12:57:21,hiixpt,"Maybe because it and 6ix9ine is trash, and all his attention and hype is dumb white teenagers"
741,2020-06-30 13:06:09,hiixpt,Good it‚Äôs trash
742,2020-06-30 13:08:32,hiixpt,Shouldn't have been #1 on the first place
743,2020-06-30 13:08:34,hiixpt,Good
744,2020-06-30 13:11:20,hiixpt,Not surprising it fell that much when it got no playlisting or radio play which is a huge factor in a song doing well. Fans alone helped it get to #1 and they accomplished what they set out to do
745,2020-06-30 13:14:29,hiixpt,Gud
746,2020-06-30 13:45:22,hiixpt,Holy shit Nicki stans on twitter are going off on anyone
747,2020-06-30 13:47:14,hiixpt,With the plastic shortage in America it's super disrespectful for Nicki to flaunt her hoard of it in the music video
748,2020-06-30 11:31:05,hiixpt,Nicki curse
749,2020-06-30 09:15:37,hiixpt,Initial numbers faked maybe? Bots?
750,2020-06-30 12:33:04,hiixpt,"Not surprising but certainly very interesting, I mean wow what a formula they executed ‚Äî perfectly nailed the combination of video, lyrics, hype, spectacle, sexuality, etc to propel this thing to a national stage"
751,2020-06-30 10:13:28,hiixpt,[deleted]
752,2020-06-30 12:52:15,hiixpt,No its was nicki fans going crazy with pure sales and bundles. After 4 days it was streaming less than Gooba. But Gooba only sold 14k pure and Trollz sold 118k pure. Which is crazy
753,2020-06-30 09:33:49,hiixpt,The only thing they forgot was to make a good song
754,2020-06-30 12:24:21,hiixpt,Who tf buying a physical 6ix9ine CD?!?!
755,2020-06-30 12:31:46,hiixpt,"ah yes, the Khaled approach"
756,2020-06-30 12:39:53,hiixpt,69 always has cute puppies or kittens in his videos also
757,2020-06-30 13:36:44,hiixpt,maybe it was just the novelty of having snitch nine continue to troll and a lot of ass in his recent videos. Getting yelled at by the rainbow dude gets annoying if there isn‚Äôt ass being shaken.
758,2020-06-30 11:53:46,hiixpt,I‚Äôm still getting mentions when I said that it wasn‚Äôt going to stay near the top. They‚Äôre a different breed. Why can‚Äôt they be like kpop fans and at least do something with their numbers. (Btw I hate both but at least one group did some good)
759,2020-06-30 13:23:32,hiixpt,They blame 69 for being a pedo.
760,2020-06-30 09:25:44,hiixpt,"Yeah the Spanish language music could easily carry him alone If it picks up big in Spanish speaking countries. 

I honestly think almost no one is cancelable if they still make hits. Gummo, Keke, Kooda are all orders of magnitude better then his new stuff. trollz is bizarrely bad I thought I was listening to a SoundCloud song when I first heard it. 

He needs Zillakami back in the studio lol"
761,2020-06-30 09:59:25,hiixpt,He‚Äôs the worst thing to happen to rap in the past 5 years imo
762,2020-06-30 11:20:27,hiixpt,GOOBA is climbing back up on the charts and has over 1.5M tiktoks. TROLLZ was a miss but GOOBA is definitely big because it‚Äôs a song people who like 6ix9ine want. Aggressive with a little mixed in.
763,2020-06-30 12:28:39,hiixpt,"> Gonna be so interesting following him to the album launch.  

Stop giving attention to a literal child molester. The whole reason this bag of shit is ""famous"" is because people jokingly started following him."
764,2020-06-30 10:27:56,hiixpt,how much do you think he'll do first week? his streaming numbers are so average I really can't see him doing more than 150k unless he does some extreme bundle cheese
765,2020-06-30 11:38:20,hiixpt,You‚Äôre gonna be surprised how many people actually just plain like his music. The gimmick works but he‚Äôs also putting out bangers like GOOBA and KEKE AND MAMA that got played in clubs everywhere
766,2020-06-30 09:53:42,hiixpt,"The substance is **absolutely there**. The problem is that he isn't playlisted at Spotify and Apple Music which is where a lot of plays come from. 

I agree with /u/boylifeineu - 6ix9ine's real meal ticket will be his Spanish music because clearly there is A LOT of demand for that. If he became an active music maker in latin trap / reggaeton, he'd pretty much instantly be top 5 with Bad Bunny, Anuel, JBalvin and probably Ozuna."
767,2020-06-30 11:55:42,hiixpt,Probably but it also reaches the charts every single year for like 25 years now
768,2020-06-30 11:59:01,hiixpt,"That *technically* doesn't count ‚Äì 1-OUT can't really be quantified, that goes under 'biggest dropouts' instead of 'biggest falls off #1'"
769,2020-06-30 13:19:47,hiixpt,We're talking about a debut on 1#
770,2020-06-30 12:56:00,hiixpt,New Body is a great track if we‚Äôre being honest lol.
771,2020-06-30 11:16:57,hiixpt,new body absolutely needs to be dropped though if we keeping it buck
772,2020-06-30 12:58:47,hiixpt,"""Crazed nicki fans""

Lmao look at the original song thread on this sub and compare it to the comments in this thread. I'm willing to bet a ton of simps were hyping this garbage up and are now acting like it was predictable.

This sub likes to act like they're above Tekashi until he drops a new song and idiots are like ""this dude can't stop winning!"" or ""this shit is hard."""
773,2020-06-30 13:16:30,hiixpt,This is a perfect description of it
774,2020-06-30 14:50:39,hiixpt,He had the veneers before he went in.
775,2020-06-30 10:19:42,hiixpt,[removed]
776,2020-06-30 13:12:37,hiixpt,Has he actually been caught? Last time I checked it wasnt really likely because of the more organic like growth of his songs. I know people like to call it fake etc but I dont think he can fake these amount of numbers and get away with it lol..
777,2020-06-30 11:58:14,hiixpt,"Yeah when the year-end hot 100 drops it's gonna put everything into perspective ‚Äì¬†I'm friends with a lot of the chart predictors on twitter and from their calculations it seems that while ""Stuck with U"" is gonna make it, ""TROLLZ"" might not if it keeps falling ‚Äì¬†the first #1 to miss a year-end list since ""I Believe"" by Fantasia back in '04"
778,2020-06-30 12:42:36,hiixpt,[deleted]
779,2020-06-30 09:18:04,hiixpt,You mean they debuted top 10 and then the next week they completely fell off the board? Any recent examples in hip-hop?
780,2020-06-30 10:30:18,hiixpt,"The scotts and highest in the room debuted High and then plummeted. Many drake songs debut high and plummet(besides his #1 debuts). But highest in the room got popular later. 


Most hip hop songs debut good and then plummet or stay around forever because of streaming there isn‚Äôt much middle ground."
781,2020-06-30 09:41:54,hiixpt,Even this year Mariah Carey went 1-OUT
782,2020-06-30 12:00:19,hiixpt,"It's news because it went #1 ‚Äì¬†the last time a song went to #1 and fell this hard was ""Heartless"" by The Weeknd (1-17), similar stuff has happened this year (""Stuck with U"" & ""THE SCOTTS"" both went 1-12 iirc) but never at this magnitude"
783,2020-06-30 12:58:06,hiixpt,Big mad
784,2020-06-30 09:35:25,hiixpt,"Week old video with boobies you've seen before: I sleep

Brand new video with boobies: real shit?"
785,2020-06-30 10:26:37,hiixpt,they just completely frauded their billboard points by super stans buying a shit ton of copies. 88k sales is insane
786,2020-06-30 10:29:24,hiixpt,he's been goated though
787,2020-06-30 12:00:36,hiixpt,[deleted]
788,2020-06-30 13:15:00,hiixpt,"I definitely agree Nicki stans pushed it a significant amount, but if it was JUST her stans, then she would have WAY more #1‚Äôs"
789,2020-06-30 09:53:30,hiixpt,"Ay that‚Äôs only a requirement if you want it to *last,* if his only goal was to get a number 1 he played it perfectly"

793,2020-06-30 13:17:25,hiixpt,"Nicki stans are one of the most toxic and obsessive fanbases out there, I remember last year when Lil Nas X announced his EP, her fans started to attack him and spam his replies because he was releasing it the same day as Nicki was releasing a single.

Like they were straight up angry that someone else would release music the same day as her, and that is unhinged, these people are crazy."
794,2020-06-30 13:06:54,hiixpt,"No need to hate on kpop. Some of that shit bangs, just gotta give it an opportunity. Nicki can get all the hate though."
795,2020-06-30 10:28:04,hiixpt,"Even Chris brown is still popular. So I agree no one is really cancelable unfortunately(sometimes)

CB is trash though and you should support other more talented artists that dont constantly be trash"
796,2020-06-30 14:29:54,hiixpt,So basically his best bet is to go Lil Pump‚Äôs route and pander to international audiences because hiphop has started to get over the novelty and there isn‚Äôt much else left beyond that
797,2020-06-30 11:38:49,hiixpt,He knows Trollz is weird lol it‚Äôs called Trollz lol and it went #1
798,2020-06-30 11:00:57,hiixpt,Must‚Äôve not heard 64ar
799,2020-06-30 11:40:49,hiixpt,As a black dude I‚Äôd blame a lot more gang culture than just some dude with rainbow hair being the worst thing in rap.
800,2020-06-30 12:13:22,hiixpt,Riff raff? Lil pump?
801,2020-06-30 11:53:15,hiixpt,"GOOBA was going up momentarily but now it fell hard again (its run has been 3-11-22-37-43-36-50)

Honestly I blame that brief spike on that Belle Delphine video"

803,2020-06-30 13:07:22,hiixpt,"total conjecture, but I figure he's got bots out there juicing his numbers up. They'll be good"
804,2020-06-30 13:12:31,hiixpt,"I'll guess you're 18 and never been in a club. His shit is not being played in clubs, outside of when Gummo dropped in NYC."
805,2020-06-30 10:23:23,hiixpt,">The substance is **absolutely there**. The problem is that he isn't playlisted at Spotify and Apple Music which is where a lot of plays come from.

idk why 69 fans keep saying this. His music video did about 40m YT views first week in US. Every rap fan in the US knew that shit dropped. They just chose not to add it to their Spotify/AM playlists. 69's problem isn't discoverability at all, this is just an excuse

&#x200B;

It went from 40m views on YT in a week in US to 9.9m the week after.  Meanwhile Life Is Good is still doing 12.6m YT US views like 5 months after release even with no bouncy nicki titties. The song just isn't good enough"
806,2020-06-30 13:18:51,hiixpt,"That‚Äôs so disrespectful lol, those guys get streams from their home countries because they‚Äôre actually talented, this guy is a hack who‚Äôs trying his hardest to stay relevant, and they‚Äôre going to see pst him trying to switch to Spanish, he‚Äôs not getting a billion views on anything."
807,2020-06-30 11:54:37,hiixpt,but lets be real here Ant Clemons had the best verse on that song
808,2020-06-30 13:20:48,hiixpt,Wut
809,2020-06-30 13:19:11,hiixpt,what clip
810,2020-06-30 12:43:01,hiixpt,eh I suppose but they're still a lot more popular than trollz
811,2020-06-30 09:33:39,hiixpt,The title is worded weirdly but I think it means biggest drop off from a #1 single
812,2020-06-30 09:39:59,hiixpt,"From the number 1 place, the biggest drop of all time before this was Heartless by the Weeknd which fell to 18. All I want for Christmas fell from number 1 to off the chart completely but apparently that doesn't count"
813,2020-06-30 10:30:01,hiixpt,not really comparable considering everyone will of course stop streaming a christmas song straight after christmas tho.. also it went recurrent so it couldn't have even 50th-100th
814,2020-06-30 11:48:07,hiixpt,dan Nicky your bobbie S
815,2020-06-30 09:35:55,hiixpt,I don't understand
816,2020-06-30 10:30:15,hiixpt,doesnt billboard take streaming numbers into account now? its pretty easy to buy streams and they seem like the kind of people who would
817,2020-06-30 12:35:18,hiixpt,I hate fake titties but hers bounce right. I was surprised at myself
818,2020-06-30 12:24:24,hiixpt,"I don't think many people give a shit about how something was made to look good, as long as it does. Her idea of beauty is quite different from mine, but I support her and anyone else getting augmentation if that is what makes them happy."
819,2020-06-30 12:29:14,hiixpt,"Yeah, I never found Nikki attractive. It looks like it‚Äôs difficult for her to move like a normal person because of her surgeries."
820,2020-06-30 12:03:27,hiixpt,Lol let‚Äôs see your girl
821,2020-06-30 12:47:29,hiixpt,"Man you prolly look like [this](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/539/713/e85.png), dont be chirpy"
822,2020-06-30 13:38:30,hiixpt,"Cmon my mans, you know you gonna hit it if she throwing it."
823,2020-06-30 12:44:46,hiixpt,From the chest down yes
824,2020-06-30 13:15:33,hiixpt,"I mean she looks good after having a kid, but I wouldn't know where to even start with all that!

She was looking pretty fine in the video though and shes 37."
825,2020-06-30 12:28:17,hiixpt,You tweakin. You do realize it's all subjective too right lol
826,2020-06-30 13:09:52,hiixpt,Nah shits attractive unfortunately.  Not like wifey . But just sex wise üòè
827,2020-06-30 11:37:07,hiixpt,That was his entire plan lol GOOBA was a way better song and they got cheated so he made DAMN SURE this one hit. He probably don‚Äôt even remember this shit lol
828,2020-06-30 11:23:28,hiixpt,"I mean for the money they spent they coulda spent a lot less and had the music video be the #1 box office release (a couple guys spent $0 filming a movie on zoom then bought $25,488 worth of tickets to it, and topped the box office this year https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/06/18/unsubscribe-movie-box-office-nilsson/)"
829,2020-06-30 13:14:36,hiixpt,Yea I refuse to support this shit
830,2020-06-30 13:21:40,hiixpt,"nah kpop is fucked, artists are treated like wage slaves and have no freedom, literally the most inhuman, focus group oriented, clinically produced, emotionless music. K pop is the opposite of art and shows the bleek future of the music industry.

834,2020-06-30 10:41:06,hiixpt,"I feel like there‚Äôs a difference. Chris Brown became a superstar because he had loads of talent and still does. Tekashi got famous for his antics. This fame/infamy grew and culminated with him going to jail, snitching, and getting out almost immediately. Talk about attention grabbing! Now he‚Äôs out and he‚Äôs already reaching deep into the bag to stay on top. Full marketing brunt, all the backing he could want, and Nicki basically dancing naked in his video for 5 minutes... but now the shock and awe wears off more quickly. His rise came about in a world where being memeable is important. But being the fad is only good if you can leverage it for when you aren‚Äôt grabbing headlines.

We‚Äôll see how Tekashi adapts."
835,2020-06-30 12:16:24,hiixpt,Chris can dance like an angel
836,2020-06-30 23:31:21,hiixpt,"Yeah, but that's another situation where the rapper just didn't really have the hits to keep up with the fame. Pump is also basically a professional celebrity at this point. 

Novelty aside, all the early 6ix9ine songs went pretty hard."
837,2020-06-30 11:29:56,hiixpt,"I actually fuck with a very few of his tracks because he raps decent without the squeaky voice. And his rap associates are good too like 10K dunkin and Jwitdabeam

But every song with the squeak is pretty trash"

842,2020-06-30 12:32:29,hiixpt,"I think it‚Äôs much more likely the spike is because of tiktok. It has 1.5m tiktoks, rockstar has 2.5m for context."
843,2020-06-30 13:17:32,hiixpt,What‚Äôs going on is people give them streams and attention and they remain relevant until it runs out.

845,2020-06-30 13:24:09,hiixpt,Shit 6ix9ine isn't even played at college parties on my campus
846,2020-06-30 11:04:21,hiixpt,"Yeah - the videos pop because people enjoy the spectacle (while it‚Äôs something new, which it currently just about is) - but although I‚Äôm not saying NO ONE is there for the art, I would argue that substantially LESS people are, hence the poor streams.

69 is more of a social media phenomenon than a musical one - maybe that‚Äôs where he should go in the end. Can imagine him crossing over way more with a crazy YouTube channel than as a one note guy who just talks about pussy on fairly average beats."
847,2020-06-30 11:47:00,hiixpt,"I love watching people deny that 69 music has any talents, substance, or people enjoying his music. His music snippets to triple the views as his troll videos and he does great numbers without any play list or radio support. You disliking him personally doesn‚Äôt mean he isn‚Äôt popular ü§®"

867,2020-06-30 12:56:07,hiixpt,"They‚Äôre still both absolutely trash songs put out by trash human beings. 

There‚Äôs so many good hip hop artists out there, I have no idea why anyone finds these fucking  clowns impressive."
868,2020-06-30 13:28:40,hiixpt,"That sounds like hiphop in the early 2000s. Death Row Records and suge knight, whatever happened with Lil Wayne and Birdman. All industries grow and exploit young talent. Kpop isn't new to the party. 

As for emotionless, I dont speak Korean, but I haven't found it to be emotional in the sense that it inspires emotion in me. Clinically produced is the definition of pop music, so I take no umbrage at that. 

Having said all this, I barely listen to Kpop, just like American pop. Its just not for me. But I dont put it down because it isn't for me and I don't bash the fans because they stan super hard."

he's defo top 15 rn in terms of popularity"
879,2020-06-30 12:15:21,hiixpt,"Yeah I wouldn‚Äôt deny any of that - not at all - and even the trolling/memeing isn‚Äôt without merit. Artists are looking for exposure after all. He‚Äôs not for me in any way musically, but I‚Äôm totally interested in him as a phenomenon and just enjoy speculating about where it‚Äôs all going. Like, even if I don‚Äôt like the guy, I‚Äôd be a fool to say he‚Äôs not totally bringing it in some senses."

887,2020-07-01 07:12:44,hiixpt,"It's up to the parents to teach their kids that having this kind of body is unrealistic and not a reflection of society's beauty standards. Furthermore, everywhere Minaj gets discussed people are quick to point out what they don't like about her physical appearance, which goes to show that people's decision to augment themselves with surgery isn't seen as normal. 

I don't look to celebrities to tell me how to look, nor do I feel less attractive because I don't have plastic surgery."

901,2020-06-30 13:41:40,hiixpt,"Nah watch the video it's a whole different level to how hip hop has ever operated, artists are literally scouted, groomed and trained at camps from childhood. They can be released at any point and even the small percentage that make it end up with terrible deals making shit money while the companies behind it rake in the billions. Its super super fucked up."
902,2020-06-30 12:25:43,hiixpt,That man made like 3 Joyner Lucas songs into club bangers. Gotta give credit where its due.

906,2020-06-30 13:23:21,hiixpt,No there are clubs open in like seven states rn for some stupid ass reason
907,2020-06-30 12:09:33,hiixpt,Top 15? Surely he‚Äôs top 5. But by popularity do you take into account streaming numbers? Because if it‚Äôs just based off how known they are GLOBALLY 6ix9ine might be number 1

If your saying you should not compare yourselves to others than the people who want surgery should just be happy with what they have quite clearly? What you said is contradicting. You want poor people to be happy with what they have but when it comes to looks it's not the same? FML logic in 2020 people are stupid as fuck.

937,2020-06-30 13:03:17,hiixpt,Billboard platforming the rival release of the week multiple times and adding it to a bunch of play lists and giving it 10x more radio play is definitely some form of preventing 69 from getting #1. Regardless of how much 69 hinders his chances of getting #1 they definitely tried to stop him with gooba
938,2020-06-30 13:22:58,hiixpt,Yeah you can only play the game so many times after they show your cards. Billboard themselves promoted the opposing song DAYS before
939,2020-06-30 13:46:27,hiixpt,chris brown taught us people don't care about what big artists do behind the scenes. all his new songs still have hordes of women talking about how fine he is in the comments

‚ÄúWahhh why dont i look like the model on tv? I derive all of my self satisfaction from how i think others perceive me, and this personal mental problem is actually the fault of society!!‚Äù 

What exactly would you like to see happen? People arent allowed to be hot anymore? People arent allowed to get bigger tits if they want them? Bigger ass? 

Where does that slope end? Should people not be allowed below a certain BMI? God forbid someone fat sees someone skinny and gets triggered."

975,2020-06-29 21:50:10,hi7c53,"In your pre 90s list at least, you mention many of the artists that are in my MP3 player. I dont know how old you are, but take a look further back, like 70s, GF :) Tons of great stuff there. Also early 80s(early MTV days) were GREAT too. check out artists like, Barry Manilow, Carpenters, BeeGees, Juice Newton, Dusty Springfield, and Reba McIntyre were great and have always spoken to my inner woman, long before my egg cracked. Music had always been a way for me to escape dysphoria."
976,2020-06-29 20:29:09,hi7c53,"Thanks for the list!  I've been doing this recently too, and this is giving me all sorts of ideas."

I like to listen to black eyed peas when I'm training."
978,2020-06-30 02:53:05,hi7c53,"Wow hard relate to this post! This was a big part of me figuring out my gender identity. I've always loved pop music from all decades and had to repress a lot of that love to try to fit in as a man. I've been listening to so much femme pop lately and it makes me feel so liberated and myself. I still like some more masculine music but on the whole I think my music taste is more ""feminine"" (whatever that means) and it feels good to admit that.  My music taste is a lot more diverse now. Kim Petras Malibu video was what made me finally admit to myself that I'm trans and that's song of the year for sure!"
979,2020-06-30 08:11:17,hi7c53,"Yeah, this was totally my experience. I always loved pop songs by women but to a pretty big extent was ''ashamed'' of admitting it to the wider world. The degree to which depended on the song.  Embracing that love has been great."
980,2020-06-29 19:58:18,hi7c53,"It also should be noted that it is a point of internalized racism to avoid pop music as a whole, not just internalized ‚Äúfemmephobia‚Äù or whatever that means lol"

982,2020-06-29 20:39:50,hi7c53,"How so?  ü§∑ I don't like pop music.  I like aggressive stuff, including gangsta rap."

984,2020-06-29 20:41:12,hi7c53,"That statement itself is even more.. tone deaf and frankly far more insidiously racist than just not liking pop music but that‚Äôs an entirely different conversation from the one we‚Äôre having.

Black people being a foundation of most, if not all, music genres, pop music is purely based on what is attractive; The aesthetics. Black ideals are attractive but not black skin.

What you‚Äôve said is ‚ÄúI like gangsta rap‚Äù as a contrast to pop music, othering black people before any context is given is at the very least is.. really fuckin strange and at worst, sparks red flags that as black person I would avoid talking to you just based on that."
985,2020-06-30 04:42:13,hi7c53,"despite your explanation here, I‚Äôm still having trouble understanding how avoiding pop music is racist. there are many people who don‚Äôt like pop music for different reasons. could you please provide a concrete example as to how disliking pop is racist?"
986,2020-06-29 20:46:25,hi7c53,"Okay, outside of rap, I also like Nat King Cole, Chuck Berry, Jimi Hendrix, Fishbone, Sevendust, Bad Brains, and Body Count.

If you want to insinuate I'm racist, then you don't know what the word means. üôÑü§∑"
987,2020-06-29 20:47:42,hi7c53,"Oh yes, please white girl with blonde hair and blue eyes, tell me what racism is because apparently my black ass just doesn‚Äôt know when I‚Äôm being micro-aggressed by overly defensive whites over the internet. Please. Give your thoughts on what makes up racism. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs very compelling. 

News flash: all white people, whether they‚Äôre actively trying to or not, contribute to racism. Someone saying you‚Äôre racist is at the least an objective observation and at the worst someone telling you to shut the fuck up when you‚Äôre speaking on stuff you don‚Äôt understand, have the resources to study, but just choose not to."

993,2020-06-29 16:08:48,hi2o22,"Well, I was shopping in Walmart the other day, (with the intent of buying all of their guns, bacon and American flags) when I spotted a Mooslem running frantically up and down through the aisles, and his name was Abdul-Mohammed-Jamal-Jabar-Steve-Jabar-Omar-Abdul. I was certain at any moment he would yell 'Allah Akbar'. Thankfully, my shopping cart was full of bacon (which as you all know, is Mooslem kryptonite). So I straightened my MAGA hat and pulled up my Confederate flag britches and grabbed a pack of bacon from my cart. I took that Mooslem over my knee and spanked his ass with the bacon while screaming 'Liberalism is a mental disorder!' over and over. Then, by the power of the bacon,  Abdul-Mohammed-Jamal-Jabar-Steve-Jabar-Omar-Abdul instantly converted to Christianity and registered as a Republican. Trump showed up and awarded me the Medal of Honor because I probably stopped the next 9/11.

1000,2020-06-29 20:32:48,hi2o22,what?
1001,2020-06-29 15:38:52,hi1ukn,"Idk what the right move here is, I think if you feel comfortable one way over another then go that route.

What matters more is how you describe the activity imo. If you can explain with the 150 characters or in a supplemental that most colleges receive what you do and you can show your passion then I think you‚Äôll be okay"
1002,2020-06-29 16:13:02,hi1ukn,"You sound genuine and for that, I really applaud you. So many kids make (relatively) bs non profits, and I really feel bad for the fraction of kids like you who aren't doing things primarily for apps. 

Now for your answer. I suggest listing it on the Common App, but consider writing one of your essays on it or somehow find a way to elaborate more on your work. Being honest and authentic will help u. Don't let others stereotypes dissuade u from including a meaningful part of your high school experience"
1003,2020-06-29 17:16:04,hi1ukn,"I think if you can convey genuine passion in your application and your LoRs reflect that as well, you‚Äôll be fine reporting it as a nonprofit.

As for AOs, no one really knows, however, it seems as if every person who got into Stanford on YouTube started some sort of nonprofit. Some of them are obv better and more impactful than others, but they all did it and Stanford AOs seem to eat nonprofit stories up."
1004,2020-06-29 16:22:30,hi1ukn,"think about your intentions. I know some people who started nonprofits because they sincerely, genuinely want to give back to the community. Others, the 99.99%, make up some shady nonprofit solely for the sake of college apps and neglect it after they get into college. It looks to me like you're part of the 0.01%. Best of luck"
1005,2020-06-30 19:35:30,hi1ukn,"Also another point to add to your pro-con list is that for it to be a non profit organisation, you have to register it as such and pay the relevant taxes for non-profits in whatever country/region you're living in. Not all community service is a non profit"
1006,2020-06-29 23:24:39,hi1ukn,"I really don‚Äôt know how you should spin it. I started a tutoring ‚Äúbusiness,‚Äù but I tutor some of the kids for free. I‚Äôm trying to decide whether I should portray it as a ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù or ‚Äúnon-profit.‚Äù"
1007,2020-06-30 23:39:49,hi1ukn,Sure call it a non-profit or not for profit I honestly don't know the difference between the the two. What matters is that you're giving back to the community for the purpose of the organization.

1011,2020-07-01 00:58:38,hi1ukn,Thats the thing. You don't have to register as a non profit for your initiative to count as a non profit.

1014,2020-07-02 11:31:42,hi1ukn,"True but its best not to get caught up on the wrong side of law. There's very little difference in the impact you will have as a non profit or as a project. Instead of talking about the label, talk about how it was meaningful to you and to other stakeholders. Talk about the impact you've had. It's not worth it to bend the truth that much"

1063,2020-08-20 08:46:02,id6j3o,You can choose better role models...
1064,2020-08-20 09:46:47,id6j3o,Yes the only role model options are 4 famous rappers that definitely make music to inspire kids and become role models. They should definitely stop doing what they've been doing when they become famous and become fucking PBS rappers and tell kids that sex bad and they should save themselves until marriage.
1065,2020-08-20 09:09:31,id6j3o,"The Beatles promoted sex and drugs, as did... basically any rock n roll group. Lizzo promotes sex as well, but her music isn‚Äôt like Cardi B‚Äôs. Music has been about that stuff since the 60‚Äôs. There are hundreds of examples of stuff like this and I feel that calling out those four specific examples as support for your argument isn‚Äôt fair. What‚Äôs the difference between saying the  music industry causes ‚Äúvague societal problems‚Äù and video games causes ‚Äúvague societal problems‚Äù aside from them being both vague and not actually correlated to the issue. Music about sex and drugs doesn‚Äôt Cause problems. If you think sex and drugs are an issue, than a better argument would be to say that sex and drugs cause the music industry. Music reflects the times. 

Singing and talking about drugs is fine. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with it. No one is actively acting like they are a role model.  And while I agree the excessive way it is done nowadays is bad and can be damaging, it doesn‚Äôt mean it actually affects the majority of people. but I mean you‚Äôre 21, I‚Äôm 20, we were in high school not that long ago. Most people will sing a song , even like a song, cuz it‚Äôs popular. without even really knowing what it‚Äôs about. Sure that doesn‚Äôt work for WAP, but the ‚Äúdeath of societal dignity‚Äù isn‚Äôt gonna be brought about by people writing songs. Besides, censorship is already a major problem, and throwing in Cardi B into the mix because you‚Äôre scared the ‚Äúyoungins don‚Äôt got no real good role models these day Days‚Äù only serves the make the issue worse. 

I guess I have a few points against your statement, sorry if it‚Äôs a bit of a ramble."
1066,2020-08-20 08:50:39,id6j3o,"I do have to agree, not just in music but also people like Jake Paul being questionable at best. Kids are getting scammed or misled for profit left and right."

Oh! what about ghandi and his racist and sexist views! or susan b anthony and how she fought for women‚Äôs rights but said she would rather cut off her own arm then fight for the right of black people! There are no real role models in this world. not celebrities, not historical figures not anyone. plus it‚Äôs parents responsibility to be role models for their kids. people who say role models are bad now a days are lazy people who want their children‚Äôs good influence to come from someone else"
1070,2020-08-20 14:21:49,id6j3o,"Who stopped you from picking better role models? Get outside Hollywood & america once in while. Looke people world over.
There are tons of inspirational people doing amazing things out there stop moaning about everything. You don't like something avoid it. Saying this is bad or this is good doesn't actually do shit. Any press is good press. You lobbying against an artist gives them free clout."

1072,2020-08-20 11:45:20,id6j3o,"Agreed!  But it's really everyone who has made these people popular.  I don't think that a musical artist should try to become a good role models, they are just artist who do what they do to sell records.  It doesn't say anywhere that these people should be good role models.  It's people who make them ""cool"", ""popular"", and look up to them.  Why? Because it's typically more exciting and engaging.  I would say take the positives and ignore the negatives."

1074,2020-08-20 12:12:32,id6j3o,I'd consider jhonen Vazquez a bit of a modern role model and he seems like a cool dude. And honestly for the youth I'd say internet personalities are much more influential on them then artists
1075,2020-08-20 14:08:16,id6j3o,their job is to make music not be role models lmao and their is nothing *inherently* wrong with sex nor drugs so what exactly is the issue?
1076,2020-08-20 17:23:05,id6j3o,"There's always going to be bad and good role models, you just have to pick the right ones.

1083,2020-08-20 17:03:07,id6j3o,"> Only people who will disagree are people of our age who are fucking stupid and idolise these people

Or people who are old enough to realize that you choose your role models, so anyone who idealizes them is doing it to themselves. In my generation there were rappers that were literally murders, so the idea that women talking about sex is going to ruin a generation is kinda fucking silly"
1084,2020-08-20 09:08:13,id6j3o,Seriously? Just because the OP has cited people who happen to be black you want to use the term white privilege to silence them?

Also, don't talk to me about age. Because now that I mentioned the media, it's not like ""grown ups"" can act any smarter than kids when it comes to fake news and all that kind of stuff. And whether you're old or not, since you're rejecting these models, how is that not the same with admitting that they are useless? So why even disagree?"

1095,2020-08-20 10:00:34,id6j3o,"No, I‚Äôve never heard of him. And that is the point. The OP referenced people that were in the general public‚Äôs consciousness. There are of course worse people out there, but the post was about role models and the more famous the person the more likely they are to be a role model for the general population."

1099,2020-08-20 10:17:30,id6j3o,"No, as I‚Äôve said I don‚Äôt have any interest in modern music. I‚Äôm sure if you spoke to the majority of people my age or older in the UK they would say the same thing. Having a number one song and being in the general public‚Äôs consciousness aren‚Äôt necessarily the same thing."

1101,2020-08-20 12:04:30,id6j3o,No I think his music is very garbage. He brings no value to the rap genre. I wish he would disappear into obscurity.
1102,2020-08-20 12:06:33,id6j3o,Agree but I also think if you are not black just don't say n word like 69. It has nothing to do with Mexicans owning or not owning slaves

1112,2020-08-19 20:34:11,icufhx,"The lack of low end on the piano parts is really apparent, especially in the verses. Kick and Bass should be much more prominent which will fill out a lot of low end as well. You are really close honestly, sounds great so far"

I also really make sure anything that isnt low end is highpassed at least 100hz (in this case the piano and the vocals). Even with doing this though everything sounds squished"
1114,2020-08-19 20:37:36,icufhx,I do think my piano could be a little fatter though I am worried because i might end up leaving no space for my kick and 808. So far I have cut 100hz in the piano. What tips would you recommend in terms of adding prominence to  my kick and 808.
1115,2020-08-19 20:09:00,icufhx,Did you try mixing in mono at all on this and focus just on carving out with eq?
1116,2020-08-19 20:57:49,icufhx,"the bass element(not sure if its an 808 or not) that comes in at 40 seconds is just way too quiet. If you have an EQ with a spectrum analyzer, use it to help you carve out space so your kick and 808 play nice together. Sometimes side chain compression is needed to get this to work, but not as often as some people think. EQ is everything.

Dont be afraid of the low end on your piano, sure you can probably high pass it, but find out where the girth of it is and let it shine, its probably not as low as you think, cut that freq out of your bass elements if needed. You could also duplicate the piano, extreme low pass so its just low end, and blend it to taste with the original signal so you have more control over exactly how much low end comes in. You could also automate this during the parts where certain bass elements come out so you dont lose low end. This is a great trick I use on bass guitar instead of reamping and I can often get some really good results

Even stuff like gently (GENTLY) high passing bass elements can help let them shine because it removes some low end build up that is clouding the"
1117,2020-08-19 20:10:26,icufhx,Thats actually something that I have not tried! I do know that dereki ali (kendrick‚Äôs mix engineer) mixes in mono first. If ever though is mixing mono usually done for eq purposes or even volume adjustments are applicable too?
1118,2020-08-19 21:03:20,icufhx,"im actually surprised to hear that the 808s seem quiet!!! I was afraid of really turning up my 808s since it sounds hella boomy on my monitors and the devices i test it on (my monitors are krk rokit g4s sadly since I am still saving for better monitors, i would also test my songs on my bose soundlink bar). I normally cut 40hz from the kick and sidechain the kick to make room for the 808, I do want to boost my 808s really loud but idk how to ensure that it wont be too ‚Äúboomy‚Äù and suffer a loss in dynamics. My attempts at having a super loud 808 before ended up messing with the maximizer which made the song sound quiet even if its peaking at -14LUFS. i do make sure though that when I set levels, i focus more on turning the fader down rather than always putting it up to boost stuff since i wanna ensure that my mixes have a lot of headroom"
1119,2020-08-19 20:14:21,icufhx,"So eq purposes and volume adjustments in this sense is the same exact thing, except your volume is more detailed to frequencies. 

Mono just makes it a lot more apparent what frequencies are masking because there‚Äôs no panning to hide it. 

You can even try cutting out everything under 100Hz on your master and focus on mixing the mids first in mono. Then once that kick is super audible and vocals are carved in their space, then you can go back and check the sub 100 frequencies and balance that in"
1120,2020-08-19 21:24:08,icufhx,"Different workflows work for different people, but unless you REALLY know what your doing, i would not suggest mixing into a limiter. Just do your thing, keep consistent headroom and control your dynamics by hand. If you push the volume on something and its triggering whatever buss compression you have, just adjust the threshold, automate it if you have to. I dont know what your working with but it sounds like thats what was going on with the maximizer"
1121,2020-08-19 20:22:07,icufhx,DAMN!! your tip is super helpful AND it even made me realize why the mixing legends like using NS10s!!! I will def try this because masking has def been the root cause of my mixing issues.
1122,2020-08-19 20:26:00,icufhx,"How do i deal though with harshness, like i want my mix to be bright but i also want it to feel ‚Äúround and smooth‚Äú just like how my reference mixes are. I noticed even specifically in the mix that i sent, it lacks the ‚Äúfull round warm sound‚Äù that Kendrick‚Äôs Humble seems to have."

The hard truth is, many army's would ""stop stanning"" BTS if they had a collab with an African artist, because they(army's) wouldn't be happy. They(army's) are from many countries and cultures and they could feel that BTS are promoting African culture over other cultures. There are people who are hard BTS stans and they don't see past many things, those fans are usually on stan twitter and, as you know, it's not a great place to be, because there is a high chance that army's are following a fan account, with many subscribers, that's creator is racist and that person might start to spread misinformation because they got disappointed, because they're from a culture that doesn't get opportunities like that.

1300,2020-09-06 21:02:49,insjx5,Everyone who lost money this year is going on tour. I‚Äôd expect more concerts than ever next year.
1301,2020-09-06 19:56:10,insjx5,Everyone please wear their mask so I can live my gay fantasy and see Gaga (with Rina opening) and Dua in the same year.
1302,2020-09-06 20:19:52,insjx5,BTS had 15 stadium shows sold out in North America for 2020 that have been postponed but not yet cancelled.
1303,2020-09-06 20:55:29,insjx5,"As someone with tickets to Lover Fest, idk why people keep acting like it's already been cancelled? It's indefinitely postponed to next year, and I guess we'll see if it gets pushed back again, cancelled, or scheduled for real in summer 2021. (Tbh I think cancellation is more likely than a show next summer, but I would rather have it be pushed all the way back to 2022 than give up my tickets üò≠)

I'm really hoping to see Dua, Rina, Allie X, Haim, and Chloe x Halle on tour once concerts can safely start up again. I also bought tickets to see Kesha and JoJo this year, back when that was a reasonable thing to be doing -- those concerts were fully cancelled, but I hope the opportunity to see them tour their new albums comes up again!"
1304,2020-09-06 22:11:32,insjx5,"I'm going to take a leap of faith and say that we won't see touring return until at least June 2021. The vaccines are close to being done, but the WHO released a statement recently that global vaccination won't be reality until halfway through next year. Even June 2021 for concerts feels conservative, because I have to assume there will be some lag time after the pandemic is ""over"" before concerts go fully back to normal."
1305,2020-09-06 21:43:13,insjx5,Why doesn't Nicki tour alone tho? Is she not able to fill arenas on her own or what? Im legit curious

1308,2020-09-06 22:20:23,insjx5,"I‚Äôll be very surprised if tours on the scale of popheads‚Äô faves will be able to happen in the first half of 2021. I had tickets to see Harry, Dua and Gaga but I will be shocked if any of those go ahead when they‚Äôre supposed to, in the UK at least. Shows at MSG in January/February 2021 are already being rescheduled for 2022."
1309,2020-09-06 23:51:36,insjx5,"I think it‚Äôs a bit over optimistic to expect any sort of large tour before September 2021 - remember vaccines still take months roll out and we‚Äôre a long way away from overcoming this virus in Europe and Asia, let alone the shit show that is America right now (you guys are aware you are no where near done with this, right? Just because we‚Äôve opened up in Europe and East Asia doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs all over now)"
1310,2020-09-06 20:49:19,insjx5,"All I know is that considering the show was supposed to be in April and I've since moved to a whole-ass new region, I wish Billie's people would at least come up with *something* besides ""postponed"" so that I could get a refund. I really need the money right now üò≠"
1311,2020-09-07 02:51:59,insjx5,"I was supposed to see Allie X on her Cape God tour in Atlanta so fingers crossed that I‚Äôll get to see her tour that album still next year. I saw her open for Marina in Seattle last year and she was fucking electric. I love Marina to pieces and she‚Äôs outstanding live (it was my 4th time seeing her) but Allie was even better. Her voice just filled up the entire auditorium, some of the best live vocals I‚Äôve had the pleasure of listening to in person. She fucking killed it. The live rendition of ‚ÄúFresh Laundry‚Äù was everything."
1312,2020-09-07 10:51:20,insjx5,"She hasn‚Äôt released an album yet, but Lily Allen has said she has recorded quite a few songs, and the reason she hasn‚Äôt released them is because she needs to tour to make money, since streaming isn‚Äôt doing her much good. Fingers crossed for an album sometime next year and maybe a tour at the end of the year or start of 2022"
1313,2020-09-07 16:54:17,insjx5,"Cardi has been clear that she gets paid more for one-off 45 minute shows rather than a true tour. I‚Äôll be curious to see what she does next, I could see her co-headlining with Megan. Her stage sets are amazing!"
1314,2020-09-06 21:44:40,insjx5,"Not really a tour but I expected to see Charli here in Mexico this year and it didnt happen :(
I hope they postponed it and not cancel."
1315,2020-09-06 22:25:33,insjx5," Avril Lavigne will continue her tour from January-March 2021! 

Was supposed to happen from February-May 2020 but got rescheduled."
1316,2020-09-07 03:18:53,insjx5,"Well, the Rona tour for one"
1317,2020-09-07 16:53:00,insjx5,"That was supposed to happen last summer, it won‚Äôt happen now"
1318,2020-09-06 21:04:28,insjx5,"> I‚Äôd expect more concerts than ever next year.

as someone who works for a football stadium, my bank account is ready to be filled."
1319,2020-09-06 22:13:25,insjx5,"Gaga and Rina are too powerful for me to handle in one night, lmao."
1320,2020-09-06 20:59:39,insjx5,Was Rina ment to open for gaga?!?!?
1321,2020-09-07 10:52:32,insjx5,Rina is too good for opening. She needs a full tour to herself to promote the hell out of the masterpiece that is SAWAYAMA
1322,2020-09-07 09:51:15,insjx5,Rina? She‚Äôs going on a tour of her own (with Hana opening) this year and next.
1323,2020-09-07 16:10:25,insjx5,Take me with you
1324,2020-09-06 22:44:25,insjx5,i feel like huge stadium tours and shows will probably be the last ones to resume due to how high capacity they are. beyonc√© apparently had a stadium tour booked to begin this year too that was pushed back. i could see bts doing one off shows in south korea and maybe japan depending on the situations there at various points in time but i don't think the MOTS tour will be able to begin for at least another year
1325,2020-09-07 09:10:48,insjx5,I feel like Lover Fest will be reimagined now she has a whole other album out.
1326,2020-09-06 21:45:20,insjx5,"Beats me. The Pinkprint tour had sooo many guest appearances, so maybe it's just her thing?"
1327,2020-09-07 16:52:17,insjx5,"She is not able to fill arenas on her own. 

Her co-headlining tour with Future was cancelled due to lack of sales (‚Äúscheduling issues‚Äù after the dates had been announced, venues had been booked, tickets had been sold) and a few of her UK dates with Juice Wrld were cancelled from a rumored lack of sales."
1328,2020-09-06 21:21:22,insjx5,That's all I need üò≠üò≠üò≠
1329,2020-09-06 22:14:39,insjx5,"If she goes on tour, which is unlikely, it would probably be in late ‚Äò21/2022. She just had a child, so that‚Äôs probably he number one focus. Though, I would kill to see her do a show similar to Britney‚Äôs Circus Tour."
1330,2020-09-06 21:44:05,insjx5,Welcome to the circus
1331,2020-09-07 16:47:54,insjx5,I think it‚Äôs basically confirmed Katy is doing a residency at the Coliseum in Las Vegas?

1333,2020-09-07 03:09:39,insjx5,SAME i haven‚Äôt been back since March...i was supposed to work the Hella Mega Tourüò≠
1334,2020-09-06 22:33:52,insjx5,I‚Äôve seen a lot of talk about it especially after Rina covered DITD.  I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs all hypothetical but it‚Äôs fun to think about.
1335,2020-09-07 02:07:09,insjx5,Right. I highly doubt she'll tour this album. The era is basically over she probably rebrand and drop something folksy in 2021 October
1336,2020-09-06 23:57:30,insjx5,"Okay but what if it was a literal circus and she wore a clown costume and performed with elephants, bears ballancing on balls and acrobats as her background dancers"

1381,2020-10-10 12:57:11,j8jiuz,Jayz and Big Daddy Kane are separate generation but Jay was born in 1969 and Kane in 1968

1383,2020-10-10 13:48:54,j8jiuz,A 14 year album difference versus a 8 year one is the separate generation we really care about lol
1384,2020-10-10 13:44:11,j8jiuz,Well Niki Minaj and Kim both really rap
1385,2020-10-10 13:42:23,j8jiuz,That blew my mind

1390,2020-10-10 14:50:30,j8jiuz,Haha what? Confirm this bruh. She literally wrote for other members of Junior Mafia. Being around in that time dude she was the only one respected as an MC besides BIG. She used to be so filthy and raw no one was penning her shit dude. And to say she had MORE than Cardi and Drake is insane. No knock on them. Very successful artists and I enjoy them but they got whole fucking teams of people listening and perfecting each song and album before it comes out.
1391,2020-10-10 17:30:40,j8jiuz,"Cam'ron, Jay Z, Biggie and Jermaine Dupri wrote the bulk of Hardcore."
1392,2020-10-10 21:20:09,j8jiuz,Sure. Do some fact checks bro. Completely untrue. BIG has writing credits on every track but that's it that's confirmed. Cam wrote those tracks? Literally doesn't sound like Cam lyrics at all. Also you're high if you think Jay wrote the majority of that shit. Kim was her own kind. Why can't we give credit to her and BIG for crafting an unreal album?

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

-''' What do you think about Die Antwoord's new video? ''
-' ' A shit completely, I saw it on the same day of the premiere, I saw myself painted on a wall with several of my fellow artists and we were labeled that we were a demon or some shit like that, when I saw Gaga I was very angry because I felt that he they wished death and I said how the fuck can you mess with an artist as big as Gaga, Youtube shouldn't allow those shit videos.

But in their short by Harmony Korinne for example, they talk about how no one takes them seriously. They want to be taken seriously and they want to be respected and that‚Äôs why they‚Äôve went to such great lengths to keep this up. There‚Äôs two conversations - the mainstream would bring them up as villains and respond to their disses which only serves to verify their relevance.

1520,2020-10-10 04:36:08,j7xzji,"> I will be your father figure

> Put your tiny hand in mine

George Michael's ""Father Figure"" is full of outright pedophilic innuendo. It doesn't seem to reflect any of George's predilections in real life, and I have my theory as to why he chooses to go *there*, but it's definitely a theme a modern pop artist of his stature wouldn't have gone with nowadays.

BTW, as far as I can find, George has never spoken on the deeper meaning of the song. Does anyone know if he has If so, please enlighten me!

As for my theory, George wrote and recorded this song in 1987. That year, the Tories, under Thatcher, were campaigning for the big election by flying a very antigay banner. In particular, they drummed up fears that pro-LGBT material would be taught to children by teachers. This ultimately culminated in [Section 28](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_28), the notorious law that banned UK schools from ""promoting homosexuality"".

George Michael had realized he was gay [by 19](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/george-michael-why-i-had-to-keep-my-homosexuality-secret-403989.html), although he wasn't out to the public at that point. He was probably quite rightfully angry at the Tories' campaign.

So my theory is that ""Father Figure"" is actually one of his many protest songs (one of his subtler ones, since they can't all be ""[Shoot the Dog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoot_the_Dog)""). In ""Father Figure"", George takes the very well-worn rock and roll trope of a hetero music star (a role he'd portrayed for quite a while at that point) lusting after someone underaged in song (see a few other examples in the comments on this post). And demonstrates how something that should be condemned, and is in fact, often a crime (as the lyrics point out in ""Father Figure""), becomes accepted and celebrated despite the demonstrable harm to children, just because of heteronormality.

Contrast this to how even politely and demurely letting kids know that some people form same-sex couples (one of the things the Tories freaked out about) is deemed disgusting and irrevocably damaging to children.

You can, additionally, read the lyric ""I have had enough of crime, I will be the one who loves you 'til the end of time"" as George's declaration that he sick and tired of homosexuality being condemned by law and society. He's not actually talking about legalizing pedophilia, he just wants you to think he is when in reality he's talking about loving someone age-appropriate but somehow more controversial (at the time) because of the genders involved.

It's all actually incredibly clever, if those were his intentions. Unfortunately, it's still too easy to read the song as an affirmation and normalization of pedophilia. And of course, things have changed rather dramatically in the UK, with the Tories becoming more gay-tolerant (and the rest of society, too), while people are more aware and more ready to condemn pedophilia.

Thank you for coming to my ~~Father~~ Ted Talk!"

> So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy

> That's fine, I'll tell mine you're gay"
1594,2020-10-09 15:38:18,j7xzji,"I always think of that Reductress article thats like ""Women pauses being a feminist for 5 minutes to enjoy..."" whenever I listen to the song"
1595,2020-10-09 18:27:40,j7xzji,"I remember being IN LOVE with that song when I first heard Sparks Fly, but yeah, it's kinda surprising seeing how vocal Taylor is now about that stuff. If she ever re-records her masters, I wonder how she'll redo that song."
1596,2020-10-09 23:41:27,j7xzji,I'm not sure how Better Than Revenge's lyrics are dated. ü§î
1597,2020-10-09 17:22:59,j7xzji,"Aside from Michelle's verse, that whole song is pretty rough. ""My life would be purposeless without you""?"
1598,2020-10-10 02:44:30,j7xzji,"I came here to say this EXACTLY. I looooove this song but whenever I am singing it I am like... girl this is so wrong. please get help. don't do this to yourself. ain't catering shit to nobody.

still an awesome bop tho"
1599,2020-10-09 19:33:04,j7xzji,I watched Yesterday recently and I thought it was such a big plot hole that he wasn‚Äôt cancelled for I Saw Her Standing There
1600,2020-10-09 19:08:18,j7xzji,"That first one is actually John Lennon, not Paul Mccartney. But yeah, definitely some of the lyrics have not aged as well as others. 

Happiness is a warm gun is another one that kinda didn't age well, although through no fault of itself."
1601,2020-10-09 15:55:23,j7xzji,How is that song problematic at all?
1602,2020-10-10 04:00:28,j7xzji,">But I gotta keep an eye out for Selener

How is that lyric dated? Nicki was ahead of the curve because people were throwing that phrase around last week with Demi and her ex-fiance who is a Selena stan lmao"
1603,2020-10-09 20:16:12,j7xzji,"This was cringe even in 2012. But tbh if Justin and Selena were still together in 2020, i don‚Äôt think the reaction would be that different to what it was back then, i think the lyric probably would fly fine since the ‚Äúselener‚Äù is really the only dated lyric."
1604,2020-10-10 11:35:29,j7xzji,honestly though that song captures a whole ass mood especially in covid times. Same with Janet's Empty.
1605,2020-10-09 15:02:31,j7xzji,It‚Äôs funny how calling someone ‚Äú2000 and late‚Äù is one of the most 2000 and late things someone could possibly say
1606,2020-10-09 14:45:18,j7xzji,I thought it was 3008 and 2000 and late?
1607,2020-10-09 20:27:43,j7xzji,"Waiting by the phone is a common theme in so many classic songs. ‚ÄúBuild Me Up Buttercup‚Äù is another that springs immediately to mind. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be home, I‚Äôll be beside the phone waiting for youuuu.‚Äù"
1608,2020-10-09 18:00:27,j7xzji,"Yeah she doesn't even like that song anymore, partially because of that lyric.  I mean, I stan Allie, but that line was a lil iffy even in 2017"
1609,2020-10-09 21:25:05,j7xzji,i mean i still stan that line tbh
1610,2020-10-10 05:14:31,j7xzji,Shaking Polaroid pictures made them bad.
1611,2020-10-09 14:45:22,j7xzji,"Oh... I'm gonna cry, the nostalgia"
1612,2020-10-10 02:18:41,j7xzji,"There is extensive debate as to whether this song is ""problematic"" or not, because it's very much in-character and an indictment of the narrator."
1613,2020-10-09 14:32:36,j7xzji,"Stan by Eminem is not dated in my opinion, even if the term stan originated from it the way it's used in the song doesn't make it sound dated, maybe corny bc now it seems like a very basic double entendre but not dated"
1614,2020-10-09 15:32:25,j7xzji,The stan culture pretty much still has the same kind of obsessive mindset as it is in the song. So I'd say it's not dated at all.
1615,2020-10-09 14:51:26,j7xzji,"Fun fact: Stan's little brother Matthew is now a successful musician in his own right. His most recent album, Tickets To My Downfall, recently went #1."
1616,2020-10-09 15:54:45,j7xzji,"I think that's aged perfectly. How many of us doom scroll all day, everyday?"
1617,2020-10-09 15:57:15,j7xzji,"That‚Äôs exactly what it means, she‚Äôs literally listing impossible things. John Lennon died in 1980."
1618,2020-10-09 17:56:48,j7xzji,Mr. Grey just paged me that he'll see you now
1619,2020-10-09 18:55:29,j7xzji,"Yes and no. While she did work with him, it was very brief. Her path to superstardom really took off once she worked with Timbaland. Almost all of her greatest songs was with him after all. If you ask me, I think her legacy barely got tainted in the process because when you ask someone what they think of Aaliyah, they'll certainly mention her music, not the marriage scandal, unlike R Kelly."
1620,2020-10-09 20:12:28,j7xzji,Luckily her music got progressively better as she got the fuck away from him. Literally my ranking (as well as for many others) of her albums go in reverse chronological order
1621,2020-10-09 18:07:08,j7xzji,Sis... Ur profile pic... Who is datüò≠
1622,2020-10-10 01:50:53,j7xzji,cause you're gay
1623,2020-10-09 22:02:26,j7xzji,"I feel like it's more about the fact that at the point the song was released, ""you're gay"" was one of the most prevalent and laziest insults to throw at someone. Coupled with the fact that  the same album contains ""I Kissed a Girl"" and you end up with an artist who is not only reinforcing harmful homophobic stereotypes, but also fetishizing lesbian relationships at the same time. It's really not a good look. It's not about people ""taking themselves to seriously."" It's about being seen as human beings instead of props that can be switched out at will depending on what is best for the cis straight white woman's publicity based on shock value. But maybe I'm just an old gay that remembers being afraid to come out because ""that's so gay"" and ""don't be a fag"" were things I heard all the time growing up."
1624,2020-10-09 19:09:52,j7xzji,agree !!!!
1625,2020-10-09 20:40:22,j7xzji,Hard agree. I listen to this song when I can't seem to like any guy lol. Perfect fit if I think of her as me singing to myself üò≠
1626,2020-10-09 21:15:30,j7xzji,i grew up on this song and loved it before i even knew i was gay lol
1627,2020-10-10 00:00:29,j7xzji,Same tbh. You can find offensiveness in everything if you look hard enough.
1628,2020-10-10 01:54:56,j7xzji,Shawty had the APPA bottle jeans
1629,2020-10-10 02:33:21,j7xzji,Took me til this very moment
1630,2020-10-09 19:08:50,j7xzji,"That‚Äôs why I chose to hear the line as ‚Äúand you my lady, boy‚Äù"
1631,2020-10-10 00:46:11,j7xzji,"Can‚Äôt believe ANTI came out in 2016, it feels like a lifetime ago. üíÄ 

And I can‚Äôt believe I never noticed that line, that‚Äôs super weird considering 2016 is when the iPhone 6 came out."
1632,2020-10-09 20:09:16,j7xzji,"Ye I forgot COVID is a strain of SARS lol

I guess that makes Kanye timeless"
1633,2020-10-09 18:55:53,j7xzji,"HHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHA. This literally made me laugh out loud, thank you"
1634,2020-10-10 02:04:52,j7xzji,"honestly her first two albums have quite a few bops: Baby One More Time, Crazy, Sometimes, Born to Make You Happy, From the Bottom of My Broken Heart, Oops, Stronger, Don't Go Knockin' on My Door, Satisfaction, Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know, What U See, Lucky, Can't Make You Love Me."
1635,2020-10-09 17:22:44,j7xzji,"before i realized how misogynistic that line was, as a teenager i thought it was weird how they just talk about the guy like he‚Äôs a pair of socks or something. i mean i don‚Äôt find it exceedingly problematic it‚Äôs just strange, but there‚Äôs so many songs that do that to women so it comes off as weird to me because it‚Äôs not normalized to objectify men like that"

1637,2020-10-10 02:06:39,j7xzji,not answering because of who is on the caller ID or whether they're in your contact list is very similar to screening though
1638,2020-10-09 19:56:44,j7xzji,"I've always thought she said ""I scream my phone calls"" lol"
1639,2020-10-10 02:07:07,j7xzji,that whole album is full of bops too
1640,2020-10-10 02:13:07,j7xzji,*SHADE NEVER MADE ANYBODY LESS GAY*
1641,2020-10-10 00:39:04,j7xzji,"As a gay I‚Äôm not even mad at that lol it‚Äôs kind of iconic I even have the cd with that version on it, I protecc it"
1642,2020-10-10 16:40:25,j7xzji,"My guess would be repeating the ""She's not a saint and she's not what you think, she's an actress"" line but I'm curious too tho"
1643,2020-10-10 00:40:38,j7xzji,"They‚Äôre dated because if she had released that song today, it would be a huge controversy. People didn‚Äôt talk about feminism in 2010 like they do today."
1644,2020-10-10 02:13:52,j7xzji,She‚Äôs slut shaming her ex boyf‚Äôs new girl for sleeping around and being fake
1645,2020-10-09 17:44:31,j7xzji,"Literally. That whole song is 1950s housewife propaganda until Michelle comes in and actually acts like a woman living in the 21st century.

Beautiful song tho. I sing along to all the lyrics."
1646,2020-10-10 02:15:34,j7xzji,"He literally comes onto the stage at the end as sings ‚ÄúSHE WAS JUST 17‚Äù

Dude would‚Äôve been thrown off the stage"
1647,2020-10-09 21:11:35,j7xzji,"What did you think of the movie? 

I love The Beatles but I genuinely think the film is one of the worst movies I've ever watched."
1648,2020-10-09 23:24:00,j7xzji,Do you understand Happiness is a Warm Gun?
1649,2020-10-09 18:10:06,j7xzji,"Katy herself has [called the song problematic](https://www.nme.com/news/music/katy-perry-admits-i-kissed-a-girl-lyrics-are-problematic-2237739) and admits it hinges upon negative stereotypes of women and female relationships, derived from her own inner queer suppression. The song makes light of female/female intimacy as simply a party gag or a stunt, as the lyrics describe it as something that good girls don't do, and constantly harkens back to whether or not the male in the room approves. [Another article](https://www.glamour.com/story/katy-perry-would-rewrite-i-kissed-a-girl-video), there's a ton if you google it.

As a queer female myself I have always hated this song."
1650,2020-10-09 18:06:58,j7xzji,It‚Äôs very problematic. She‚Äôs literally describing pretending to be gay just to be rebellious. The idea that ‚Äúit‚Äôs not what good girls do.‚Äù üò¨üò¨üò¨üò¨
1651,2020-10-09 17:53:36,j7xzji,"It demeans queerness in a lot of ways, plays off kissing girls as just some fun harmless activity with no real meaning that shouldn‚Äôt be taken seriously, which is obviously problematic for wlw. 

*I kissed a girl just to try it, hope my boyfriend don‚Äôt mind it*

So she‚Äôs in a relationship but she doesn‚Äôt view kissing this girl as cheating or anything important bc it‚Äôs ‚Äújust a girl‚Äù. But bi/pan people exist, and for a lot of wlw kissing a girl is a serious thing and means something, and suggesting that it happened even when she was in a serious relationship just contributes to biphobia. 

The whole song is such wasted potential tbh bc this could‚Äôve been written as this bi/wlw banger but instead it makes wlw relationships look like afterthoughts and experiments. From the start of the song she talks about how she‚Äôs interested in the girl, afraid to approach her, etc, all the things lots of queer women go through. But then it‚Äôs immediately like oh but I‚Äôm not really in love and this isn‚Äôt serious it couldn‚Äôt and it‚Äôs just an ‚Äúexperimental game.‚Äù It honestly just seemed to be angled to encourage bi women to not believe they were bi imho. 

I‚Äôd also watch [this parody of the song made ages ago starring Karen Gillian](https://dai.ly/xesan0). It points out a lot of the issues with the song."
1652,2020-10-11 11:57:41,j7xzji,i think ‚Äúhit him with the ether‚Äù is the issue here
1653,2020-10-09 15:15:30,j7xzji,Something was very...fetch about the 2000‚Äôs
1654,2020-10-09 15:07:06,j7xzji,Fuck I dropped the ball. I‚Äôm not even gonna edit it. My fingers are fat
1655,2020-10-09 18:20:32,j7xzji,"I can‚Äôt help but still like that song, it‚Äôs such a bop but yeah I‚Äôd admit that that line makes me cringe like hell. I try to pretend I don‚Äôt hear it"
1656,2020-10-09 15:39:12,j7xzji,yes stan culture has just always been there i meant the way it was normalized over time like it had negative connotations but now it is so commonly used
1657,2020-10-09 15:24:54,j7xzji,Stan is a real person?
1658,2020-10-09 18:00:21,j7xzji,"Oh I mean yeah, but in a reverse way lol"
1659,2020-10-09 16:02:36,j7xzji,"Oh whoops, my b

Ima downvote myself for that one."
1660,2020-10-09 19:18:25,j7xzji,"I often wonder how she would‚Äôve been apart of the whole movement against him these past years. There‚Äôs no way she could‚Äôve stayed silent. Also it‚Äôs a shame in the 90s, in that situation Aaliyah was the ‚Äúbad‚Äù person in the media, and little attention was put on the fact that a grown man had done this to a minor. I‚Äôm glad though it didn‚Äôt derail her and she moved on to achieve even greater success, gosh I miss her everyday."

1663,2020-10-10 01:35:50,j7xzji,"I feel like I've lost all concept of time because of covid!

I think it's not that noticeable because of the melody"
1664,2020-10-10 02:40:22,j7xzji,"Yeah they're related coronaviruses but it isn't called SARS colloquially (and generally only called SARS-CoV-2 in scientific work) because laws about naming infectious diseases have been changed in recent years to discourage associating them with the place they were found. Obviously this only applies to newly identified diseases, we aren't changing the names of Zika or Ebola anytime soon, but the days of calling things South Asian Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) are gone. So this lyric is still outdated."
1665,2020-10-11 22:00:56,j7xzji,Born to Make You Happy also deserves mention in this thread
1666,2020-10-09 19:24:12,j7xzji,[deleted]
1667,2020-10-09 16:33:18,j7xzji,I think aside from the line which could have been changed they had also been preforming it at every show for a decade. That has to get old.
1668,2020-10-10 01:58:01,j7xzji,Pretty sure they didn't
1669,2020-10-10 00:42:33,j7xzji,I see your point. I personally would love another BTR from Taylor.
1670,2020-10-10 02:16:07,j7xzji,Yeah I know but I didn't see anything wrong with it if Camilla knew about Taylor and Joe which seems like she did.
1671,2020-10-09 18:50:50,j7xzji,"Yeah, it really is gorgeous music with the harmonies and all."
1672,2020-10-09 21:24:16,j7xzji,"I didn‚Äôt hate it actually. It‚Äôs not good, but I watched it when I was doing research on an easy I wrote about the Beatles in fiction so I saw like 5 other Beatles things at the same time that were worse and that probably skewed my perspective lol."
1673,2020-10-10 02:17:25,j7xzji,"I wish it explored more about how music changed entirely without the Beatles. Apart from a few gags where there‚Äôs no Coca Cola or Harry Potter, the music industry is exactly the same and Ed Sheeran still exists."
1674,2020-10-10 02:57:06,j7xzji,The trailer looked cute but I agree the actual movie was a disappointment. I maybe giggled at  that one joke about Hey Jude
1675,2020-10-10 02:16:21,j7xzji,Right? It's a dude singing a song about his wiener which is pretty much de rigueur these days.
1676,2020-10-09 21:55:10,j7xzji,where is she pretending to be gay? normalize being curious even if the person is referring himself as straight.
1677,2020-10-09 18:25:11,j7xzji,How does one's self discovery on sexuality be very problematic? Are u saying you can't be straight and curious about trying something different while drunk? Lol. This shit happens everyday. I'm pretty sure if a friend of yours had the same experience u wouldn't even think about it being problematic. I just dont get it.
1678,2020-10-10 02:34:35,j7xzji,what is fetch
1679,2020-10-10 02:33:19,j7xzji,what do you mean lol
1680,2020-10-09 19:29:30,j7xzji,"Tell me who it is, I thought it was BTS then I just stopped tryingüòÇ"
1681,2020-10-10 04:48:54,j7xzji,I thought SARS stands for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome?
1682,2020-10-11 22:03:12,j7xzji,i listed it!
1683,2020-10-10 02:09:50,j7xzji,"Yeah I always saw this as being an ""in-character"" song. I get not wanting to romanticise that though."

1685,2020-10-10 00:48:41,j7xzji,I‚Äôd love if she reworked the lyrics to be towards sc**ter/ that big machine guy
1686,2020-10-10 02:41:39,j7xzji,You have no idea what Joe was telling Taylor or Camilla about the situation. He could have told Camilla that him and Taylor were over and vice versa. Men the same.
1687,2020-10-09 22:50:39,j7xzji,"I just have an issue with the whole premise.  The Beatles are my favorite band.  If they released all their music now instead of in the 60s, nobody would listen to them.  All popular music is a product of its time, and the Beatles as a phenomenon wouldn't occur today.

The Beatles are also one of the most influential musical groups of all time.  If you were going to make this movie, it would have been interesting to delve a little more into how the world would be had they not existed.  Instead it was just an obvious throwaway joke about Oasis."
1688,2020-10-11 11:11:28,j7xzji,yeah singing about a dude eating a soap carving sure makes *me* horny
1689,2020-10-09 18:53:05,j7xzji,Um yeah so there‚Äôs a difference between discovering your sexuality and fetishizing the queer community.
1690,2020-10-09 20:07:11,j7xzji,Oh idk. A coworker sent it to me on teams once and I just loved it. I assume just a game show contestant
1691,2020-10-11 11:39:36,j7xzji,Oops
1692,2020-10-10 02:43:12,j7xzji,No one does. That's why I said if and it seems in my comment. Lol. It's not that deep.
1693,2020-10-09 22:57:05,j7xzji,"I agree it was pretty lazy and it bothered me that they didn‚Äôt do anything with the songs production the so they just sound like acoustic covers and misses a lot of what made their music great imo. [The original script ](https://uproxx.com/movies/jack-barth-interview-yesterday-writer-richard-curtis/) sounds like it would have been better. 

That Oasis joke was such an eye roll lol but Oasis don‚Äôt sound that much like the Beatles to me in general I‚Äôve always hated that comparison tbh."
1694,2020-10-10 02:55:07,j7xzji,You said ‚Äúseems like she did‚Äù so you are assuming to know something lol. No need to get defensive . Not that deep lol
1695,2020-10-09 23:08:41,j7xzji,Wow that original does sound a lot better.  And Richard Curtis sounds like a knob.
1696,2020-10-10 03:04:33,j7xzji,I said if and seems based off what was said by Taylor who has a pretty good track record.
1697,2020-10-10 03:05:33,j7xzji,A good track record on what? Making herself the victim? I guess

1717,2020-11-09 09:51:59,jquuqe,Neither. Listen to some good ol‚Äô Classic Rock!
1718,2020-11-09 09:52:24,jquuqe,"They're both wank, as for 'personality' I'd probably nob Nicki.

Edit: actually tell a lie I liked that song she did with Eminem, Romans Revenge I think? That was ok."
1719,2020-11-09 09:53:50,jquuqe,"Music wise, Nicki. She‚Äôs the Brittany of rap. Not very talented but still fun. I honestly don‚Äôt care about eithers personality."
1720,2020-11-09 09:54:32,jquuqe,"Nicki Minaj is much classier in my opinion, and her lyrics are better. Most of her music is pretty awesome when you look at some of the lines she spits, but like any artist, she does have some distasteful tracks. But most importantly...

CARDI B ADMITTED TO DRUGGING AND ROBBING MEN.

There is no excuse for her in my eyes. She's trash."
1721,2020-11-09 09:54:41,jquuqe,Id rather go deaf
1722,2020-11-09 09:54:52,jquuqe,"That‚Äôs like asking which ball i want electorcuted with a clamp wire, neither please"
1723,2020-11-09 10:04:14,jquuqe,Fuckin neither. They‚Äôre both hardcore trash.
1724,2020-11-09 10:06:53,jquuqe,I don't really listen to either of them but Nicki has some good collabs and some good older songs.  I definitely prefer her for personality as well because Cardi B is an objectively terrible person
1725,2020-11-09 09:53:16,jquuqe,That‚Äôs like asking if we prefer rotting fish or expired milk...
1726,2020-11-09 09:53:57,jquuqe,"Fuck if I have to choose between those 2, Nicki Minaj for me. And same as Personality.  Nicki can spit some bar that's for sure.  I saw her chyper few years ago.  Around 2009 I think"
1727,2020-11-09 09:55:42,jquuqe,"Both are incredibly unbearable as far as i‚Äôm aware, when it comes to personality in private i have nothing to base it on.

Music is, believe it or not, not for me. And when some kind of music is not for you, it‚Äôs hard to say what‚Äôs better.

But probably Nicki. She‚Äôs hotter than Cardi. Looked up their asses, yeah Nicki‚Äôs better."
1728,2020-11-09 10:05:16,jquuqe,"Used to be team Nicki. Then when Cardi came out I hated her. Around the same time Nicki was being canceled and I tried to hold on but then everything Nicki released sucked (IMO) and Cardi was growing on me suuuuuper hard. And I relate to both equally bur delivery, flow and energy/personality wise Cardi for sure."
1729,2020-11-09 10:16:12,jquuqe,"Damn, I am losing so much karma off this, I don't really like either of them tbh, I was just interested :("
1730,2020-11-09 10:17:12,jquuqe,"I personally prefer the eardrum shattering sounds of cats fucking. 

I don't know either of them personally though so I can't form an opinion of the latter."
1731,2020-11-09 10:34:07,jquuqe,I'm not into that type of music so I don't listen to either.
1732,2020-11-09 10:12:42,jquuqe,Both worthless
1733,2020-11-09 09:55:01,jquuqe,"Thank you, person of culture"
1734,2020-11-11 22:20:04,jquuqe,Same here
1735,2020-11-09 09:54:10,jquuqe,Classy
1736,2020-11-09 09:54:16,jquuqe,lol
1737,2020-11-09 09:56:23,jquuqe,Yeah I agree
1738,2020-11-09 09:57:22,jquuqe,And beating one of her ex' who was one of the despacito people i think.
1739,2020-11-09 09:55:38,jquuqe,"Haha yeah ik, I was just curious."
1740,2020-11-09 09:55:45,jquuqe,Its like asking death by being shot in the legs and bleeding out or failed lethal injection.
1741,2020-11-09 09:59:02,jquuqe,"Like I'm not gonna lie, I used to listen to Bodak Yellow, but when I found out that she not only admitted to that shit, but LAUGHED about it, I lost any enjoyment I had in her music. Nicki may act a little crass, but she's never been accused of any crimes to my knowledge. And honestly, she was a big part of rebuilding my self confidence. Some of her lyrics are fairly uplifting towards women."
1742,2020-11-09 09:59:18,jquuqe,"I hadn't heard of that, but all the more reason to hate her."
1743,2020-11-09 16:29:40,jquuqe,"It was like a week or 2 ago. She was beating someone then called them a pussy bitch or something like that, this happened on Twitter. It would be more suprising if it werent true."

1832,2020-12-14 08:11:24,kctel9,Music is not bound to any sexual orientation. So tell them to fuck off and enjoy your music!

1889,2020-12-29 16:30:05,kmhe9g,"Having your essay posted on the internet runs the risk of being detected as plagiarism by admissions. I‚Äôd delete the post right away.

Regardless of how specific your essay is, pieces of it can be plagiarized by others as well. I‚Äôve heard of a case where someone took all the essays they found and blogged them so that they‚Äôd show up as plagiarism.

Be careful."

1891,2020-12-29 17:23:12,kmhe9g,"Some crit I have for you is that your conclusion feels really rushed and unclear. I think there's a lot of fluff in the middle that should be cut out so you can focus on the end of your essay. I didn't understand what about that Atlantic article was important to you or why it changed you for the better, so it would be good to clarify that point. That being said, delete this ASAP so you don't get plagiarized"
