I much prefer these kinds of posts to the other threads on this sub, so I was excited to see someone analyzing this....but all this really shows is they held back some of the footage for later, and shot a sequence at different times. We can't really guess if there's meaning in them doing that. 

Angela's footage wouldn't have felt like a huge reveal. All it would have done was eliminated some of the wild theories caused by the misdirection, and as people were expecting there had to be more going on."
7,2020-01-20 07:12:31,er73lc,"I watched a bit of that footwork vid. He is not good, but I'm not convinced your technical criticisms are on the mark either.

Well timed pivots *can* be part of TDD for sure: https://youtu.be/SekwX_399a0?t=65

Stepping with the front heel can be fine, it just depends on context: https://youtu.be/Kp-UFEMJpOY?t=36

Neither of those things are ""Plan A"" material for barehanded striking, and I'm not convinced he'd be able to explain when and how to do them correctly, but categorically dismissing them isn't accurate."
8,2020-01-20 04:41:48,er73lc,"Seen a couple of videos, definitely not a fan. His teaching is very basic, very stiff, and not very technically sound."
9,2020-01-20 14:45:50,er73lc,"Not sure about his JKD, but he is definitely a shyster with regards to his money making. Listening to his videos he's peddling a Ponzi-esque scheme and cleary trying to pray on people who are unhappy with their jobs/careers."
10,2020-01-20 08:05:59,er73lc,Well known snake oil peddler. Check out YouTube.
11,2020-01-20 13:28:43,er73lc,"Just saying, vasyl is an absolute animal"
12,2020-01-20 18:45:07,er73lc,"Oh yeah my bad. I'm definitely no expert lol. I think you make good points too. With the takedowns I'm a rookie with any groundwork so pretty much everyone else has more experience than me but it was something I wanted to question anyway lol
I think the thing with Lomanchenko is - like other fighters; when you get so good you can get away with things that when we pick up our white belt we are told not to do these things simply because they've ironed out the intricacies. Although you've proven it to me so I can't disagree. He's great and he does it. Though Dan Lok isn't Vasyl Lomanchenko haha.

Still - you make fine points and I appreciate the input. I'm definetly annoyed by how he is though. another commenter used the term ""snake oil salesman"" which I think is very creative lmao

thanks though!"
13,2020-01-20 05:02:12,er73lc,"Agreed. Thanks for the comment.

I feel bad for the guys who pay what is most likely almost an extortionate amount for such basic training."
14,2020-01-20 18:49:44,er73lc,"The thing with the heel strike is it depends on your goal. For example: landing on the ball of your foot gets you back in the same stance immediately, but you need to ""float"" or ""hop"" a little bit to make the actual adjustment, which disorganizes you a bit. If you watch Olympic fencers you'll notice they almost always heel-strike with the front leg, which means they spend more *time* out of their default stance, but they can also fire the back leg at any time during that repositioning.

With barehanded striking we tend to prefer a ball of the foot landing because you need a fairly particular stance to generate power, and hopping/becoming unweighted for short periods of time usually isn't a problem. But heel vs toe is a situational trade-off, not a strictly better choice that some people are lazy about and some aren't.

You'll notice Loma tends to go heel-toe when he's ""creeping"" in and toe-toe when he's bouncing in and out.

And, yeah, Lok seems like a slimeball and I'm definitely not defending *his* presentation of these concepts, just saying that a slimeball pushing certain concepts doesn't invalidate them by default (nor does the default approach that you've learned being different)."
15,2020-01-20 18:57:00,er73lc,"Reading this I became a little confused when you meant 'heel strike'. I presume you are still talking about landing on the heel?

Maybe that's just down to preference then??"
16,2020-01-20 19:26:19,er73lc,"Yep, I meant landing with the heel first when advancing the front foot"

I guess we would need evidence from the killers themselves to say it’s a motivating factor."
70,2020-01-15 20:22:28,ep7qxo,What a dumb argument.
71,2020-03-25 17:26:05,fou68l,elliot isn't the only one having a heart attack i swear to god
72,2020-03-25 17:24:23,fou68l,"Uh, okay.. SO James. I guess your his legal guardian now? I don’t know enough legal stuff for how that all works out, but WOW.

Also I don’t like the “end to the relationship” thing. I can’t believe there’s only one file left, this was INSANE."
73,2020-03-25 18:22:51,fou68l,I’m guessing the betrayal is Kierra. Or at least I hope it is because it would absolutely break my heart if it was Doc.
74,2020-03-25 17:52:02,fou68l,"I was expecting the doctor to die, and it would be sad. But noooo, gotta prepare for the worst. I hate this book.

I hope the next chapter comes out soon 👀❤️"
75,2020-03-25 19:01:02,fou68l,Uh oh scoobs.
76,2020-03-25 21:02:29,fou68l,"As soon as I read the word son I gasped out ""JAMES?!?"" 


Omg omg omg are the boys going to adopt this early in their relationship?!?!"
77,2020-03-25 18:14:26,fou68l,how dare you
78,2020-03-25 21:21:40,fou68l,"A betrayal? From Kierra? What could Doc do to betray Noah, it has to be her.."
79,2020-03-25 22:49:27,fou68l,"OMG there's just one file left? Oh no, this one felt too short. Poor James, I feel my heart broke just like the doctor's.

Thank you very much for the stories, you are an amazing writer. I would buy your books to show you my support if I wasn't a broken student, but I will make sure to show your stories to everybody I know."
80,2020-03-26 03:03:59,fou68l,"""Devastating betrayal"" huh so far the only one with possible betrayal is Noah, hiding stuff about Kierra behind docs back. Or it could be related to James and a third party. Up till now doc seems to be clean"
81,2020-03-25 23:26:34,fou68l,"God darn it Aurora, so she's not your mother what the heck is she doing. She might be on your side, but she's way too confusing. Poor James..."
82,2020-03-25 23:27:50,fou68l,"Ahhh, Noah's got way too many warning about him, poor dude. Hopefully it wouldn't be Doc, or Kierra betraying him."
83,2020-03-26 00:53:45,fou68l,"I assume the patient is James' mother... hopefully, and I say this because of how much this is messing with me, it's Kierra who betrays Noah."
84,2020-03-26 02:11:02,fou68l,I love these so very much! You're the only sub I've ever turned on all notifications for!
85,2020-03-26 02:09:26,fou68l,RIP Bruce's printer
86,2020-03-25 18:31:48,fou68l,"No, I'm not ready for the last date. I NEED MOAR."
87,2020-04-03 00:18:33,fou68l,"ack.. my blood went cold with the 10 of swords. doc, i know you're a skeptic, but the cards usually have strange insights."
88,2020-03-25 20:51:19,fou68l,"Same. I am so done with this Aurora woman. Goodness.

Doc, I'm 100% with you about not trusting Kierra. Do you think she's really left the cult? What if they're helping her stage these things to get to you?"
89,2020-03-29 04:11:11,fou68l,"It could also be Zach.  As much as I hate the possibility, it would be plausible based on how he's been acting since the Prison Files."
90,2020-03-27 00:34:25,fou68l,Unless Noah betrays Doc...
91,2020-03-21 15:09:44,fmeny2,"Thank you for this, was wondering what the bike paths status were. Looks like a sunny day...will need a deep dive hike in the woods today."

Forest Preserves are closed beginning Friday March 20 until April 7 in compliance with Governor Pritzker's stay at home order."
93,2020-03-21 18:32:59,fmeny2,"Only to cars. From their Facebook page: ""Forest Preserves and golf courses are closed to vehicular traffic effective March 20 through April 7. Preserves are still open for foot traffic and visitors may access them for walking, hiking and birding while practicing social distancing and other recommended precautions. Entrance gates will be locked. Please park off the road, where possible, to enter the preserves."""
94,2020-03-22 05:31:41,fmeny2,"Why just the cars though, do you know?"
95,2020-03-22 12:01:20,fmeny2,"Probably to dissuade too many people from showing up. Also probably helps keep nefarious activities away. Pickle parking, dealing, etc."
96,2020-03-22 22:07:04,fmeny2,I see. Makes sense. Thanks.

133,2020-03-09 19:28:49,fg044l,Well. My heart. I feel so sad now :(
134,2020-03-09 20:37:38,fg044l,Ow.... Why am I Elliot?
135,2020-03-09 21:08:08,fg044l,"Oh.... ouch.....rhat hurt my heart.



This doesn't sound like its gonna go well, he tells you to stop diagnosing everyone, so you gonna go and diagnose him.



Also your mother is a peice of work! That's complete emotional abuse to make you feel like that, It hurts my heart to see a mother blame her children."
136,2020-03-09 22:34:14,fg044l,"I understand how Elliot feels, my mom was diagnosed with borderline bipolar disorder a few years ago and looking back on my childhood it makes so much more sense how she treated my sisters and everyone around us. She refuses to take medication for it so it's really tough to handle her sometimes."
137,2020-03-09 23:09:37,fg044l,"“It’s like you’ve decided there’s something wrong with you and therefore don’t believe *anyone* could like you!” Gah, I came here for entertaining shenanigans or fluffy dates, not to be fucking called out like this."
138,2020-03-09 19:38:20,fg044l,Waaaaaiiiiit wait wait. Does this mean what I think it does??
139,2020-03-09 20:43:57,fg044l,"The fact that Elliot had phones with text messages back then actually has made me rethink my entire timeline. I guess it works, though."
140,2020-03-10 00:10:43,fg044l,"Oh. That...explains a lot. I’m so sorry, Doc.

My mother and father were never that bad, but my mom enabled my Dad and my dad...wasn’t exactly the kindest or most understanding person towards an emotionally unstable and mentally ill teenager. I know saying it’s cheap, it sounds obvious, and it’s something that you have to eventually realize on your own, but what they did to you was cruel and wrong. 

(It took seeing a bit from Avatar: The Last Airbender to finally realize that emotionally.)

From what I’ve been reading you’ve been taking Noah’s keys to heart. Which is good. I hope you find some measure of peace from them."
141,2020-03-11 05:39:36,fg044l,"I just realized that Elliot mirrored his mother's words: ""I'm sorry for incoveniencing you"""

144,2020-03-10 07:05:16,fg044l,"Oh my. Poor Zach. I'm happy you guys are still friends through all that. Your mother seems very emotional manipulative, and it isn't bad if you aren't in contact with her anymore honestly. This seems like it'll be interesting, good luck with everything, doc!"
145,2020-03-10 02:41:26,fg044l,Wow. This is such a great show of bpd. I have it myself
146,2020-03-10 04:49:30,fg044l,Zach is really good friend. He never gave up on you Doc.
147,2020-03-11 03:07:26,fg044l,"It's fuckin weird that you're on this past memory shit right when I'm doing some intense EMDR work. Like damn, this feels so familiar. I cried, doc. I'm actually diagnosed borderline, but my parents both contributed to the emotions and thoughts they deemed out of control and over the top. Afterall, they taught me how to be that way. It's kind of crazy looking back at all the stuff we went through and how much of it felt totally normal to us. How else were we ever supposed to cope, ya know? When it's all you know, there's not shit else you can do. Took sooooo long to even just start breaking away from their dysfunction. And still had to move across the country lol.

It was uncomfortable for me to read how much your mom made your dad out to be the bad guy.. It just felt so fucking familiar, man. So sorry you've been through this."
148,2020-03-14 17:17:04,fg044l,Love your stories just bought all 3 of your books! So excited they arrive today! Whoo hoo
149,2020-03-09 22:32:11,fg044l,So... You were pretty much a therapist even in high school?
150,2020-03-09 23:40:56,fg044l,"Man, this was a heartbreaking read. No one person is completely in the wrong here, but everyone could have made better decisions.... and the outcome benefits no one"
151,2020-03-10 06:11:44,fg044l,"I'm confused with the cell phone thing being a razor or chocolate when Harper had to have gone through years of schooling to be a psychologist? 

Doc, if you could set me straight on your age here I would really appreciate it."
152,2020-03-10 09:12:02,fg044l,"i've never been through this, however i can relate too well to the whole not telling anyone about feelings and just saying you slept bad, and not thinking your friends are your actual friends."
153,2020-03-11 19:43:12,fg044l,"This resignated a little too much, ugh I feel this."
154,2020-03-12 18:52:42,fg044l,Are you still posting on here or not now that it's been published
155,2020-03-25 07:39:53,fg044l,Is this one just a one-parter?
156,2020-04-19 00:44:48,fg044l,"God, this hurts so much. I can relate so much to the abandonment issues. I’ve always been worried about people leaving for good because my BPD episodes were just too much. 

They were too much but it was like I couldn’t stop them. My bf has somehow stayed through out all of them. It took so long to realize that he simply loves me. He thought I wanted him to break up with me when all I want is for him to say that he loves me and won’t just leave because of my BPD."
157,2020-03-10 01:12:34,fg044l,Diagnosis: Doc is just kinda an asshole
158,2020-03-09 21:25:15,fg044l,Spot on - I’m sorry you had to go through this. People who have experienced Cluster B dynamics seem to identify these things so quickly.

164,2020-03-10 15:07:17,fg044l,Doc is 31 as of the Influencer Files!
165,2020-03-09 23:41:28,fg044l,"This by far hit the closest to date. My dad would project his own BPD onto my mom, which seems is very similar with your parents."
166,2020-03-10 00:24:40,fg044l,"Sending you big hugs, Doc. You dealt with so much, too fast. I'm glad Zach didn't turn his back on you. :)"
167,2020-03-10 00:05:40,fg044l,"I believe you and I are actually the same age/around the same age, Doc. Depending on when your birthday is you might actually be several months older than me.

(Also holy crap I remember Razr and Chocolate phones now fuck. Never had one, I was inch-thick flip phone until like fucking college I think.)"

This'll be it. He's gonna feature heavily in the end."
242,2020-03-03 03:27:48,fcnf1l,"So there's a few that we can obviously discard from the list, such as characters from other media.  A fun side note: Batman actually doesn't need to be discarded for this reason - he has two appearances in the strip.

Many of these are then also one-off joke characters, or just background characters which can also be presumed gone.  The list can be trimmed down considerably this way.

We can also trimmed anybody who wouldn't be an *unexpected* ally.  Anybody affiliated with OOTS themselves is out, anybody affiliated with the Dwarves or with Azure City is functionally already an ally, so would it be fair to say that they ""become"" an important ally?  Dunno.  Maybe some of the Azure City nobles, but I doubt it given that they'd need to travel way up north to do so, as it's likely the whole book will take place here barring some teleportation stuff.  The Mechane is out of course - they're already allies.

This narrows the list down a bit.  Here's my bets for the ones that have appeared in the comic itself:

Character Name	| Appearance | Affiliation
--- | --- | ---
King of Nowhere | 535 | Nowhere
Queen Shvitzer | 758 | Empire of Sweat
Weeping King | 758 | Empire of Tears
Tyrinar | 759 | Tyrinaria
Mia Starshine | 772 | Greysky Thieves Guild
Trevon | 812 | Empire of Blood
Orrin Draketooth | 816 | Draketooth Family
Ivy | 942 | Greysky Thieves Guild
Fidel Secundus | 959 | Mechane

And below are the characters that only appear in the prequels.  I'm less able to narrow these down given that I haven't got access to the books currently.

Character Name | Appearance | Affiliation
--- | --- | ---
Jim Slush | BRF: 855a | 
Spook | BRF: 855a | 
James Wyatt | DCF: 5 |

Several of the characters on this list are dead, including Orrin Draketooth and Mia Starshine.

My bet?  Fidel Secundus.  He's Bandana's dad, as such is allied with the Mechane but wasn't actually on it so would count as a *new* ally, and has appeared exactly once.  Current status is listed as unknown - he could absolutely be out there crewing another airship."
243,2020-03-03 02:55:12,fcnf1l,"Can we narrow it down to people who are...

* Not property of some other show or comic? L&O:SVU officers, StarGate cameos and Erfworld characters will not be critical to the plot in the final book. I'm pretty certain.
* Not dead. Really many people in the list were killed or dead in their respective pages, and unless there is potential for them to be resurrected and high-level enough to pull stuff off, they should be struck from the list. Kuurk the Anemic and Judy Morningstar? Really?
* Others should be presumed dead - like Ms. Xanadu. We should rank them close to the bottom of the list, together with people we presume powerless, like Bob Bloodcamel. Likewise, Felix the Mensch and Hurt and Burnie are parody figures. They are not directly lifted from the Muppet Universe, but I'll buy and eat a hat if they turn out to be important.

I know why you haven't done so already - you wanted to give us the complete list - but we need to pick out the likely candidates and not fantasize how Wolverine is going to help beat Xykon."
244,2020-03-03 03:13:45,fcnf1l,"Reading the list, one name pops out in particular: Balder.

He is one of the few who has a reasonable amount of power, being a god, he is likely good-aligned from what we know of the ""real"" Balder, and voted for saving the world (albeit for shallow reasons). He may offer help in some roundabout way, like Thor did in order to give directions to Durkon.

That, or the King of Nowhere is going to bring the wrath of his realm against Xykon."

I could see them being part of Elan's plan to take down Tarquin without turning it into a father-son clash. 

Admittedly a major weak point in this idea is that I don't think Tarquin is going to get much focus this volume and especially not during the first half."

333,2020-02-22 23:56:45,f80ecg,"> It is imaginable that with an increase in EU legislation, stemming from  the fact that the future federation would have greater competencies in a  number of areas such as taxation, social welfare, as well as the  introduction of European civil and penal codes, the CJEU’s workload  could increase to an intolerable level, necessitating the outsourcing of  cases to new separate courts as happened in Switzerland with the  erection of the Federal Criminal and Administrative courts. 

I had always assumed/imagined that, in a federal Europe, there would be federal courts other than the CJEU to deal with federal law cases, and only high-profile cases or cases that are appealed go to the CJEU (i.e. the USA model of doing things in this respect). Do you see any problem in this that should warn us not to do it? Or is it the same basic system as the Swiss one (I am not familiar with it)?"
334,2020-02-23 13:42:25,f80ecg,"Laws can go against the fundamental principles of the state. And in a decentralised state, jurisdiction is usually a common source of conflict. So a constitutional court is always needed, the parliament has to be balanced by other powers.


Pre or post review?

Well, in my experience it is not important. In post-review, it is done in demand and the opposition usually requires it on controversial laws or administrative acts. 

What is more efficient? That's the interesting thing. I don't have any idea how well pre-review works, but in my state, constitutional court sentences take months or years so it would be impractical to do it (the court have only 12 judges)."
335,2020-02-23 01:11:34,f80ecg,"The CJEU includes all current EU courts: the court of 1st instance, the ECJ, and the court tasked with lawsuits brought by EU employees (such as civil servants) against the EU as their employer.

I imagine that new courts would either be included in CJEU with the possibility to appeal decision in higher instances, or they would be established separately as showcased by the Kelsenian model of judicial review. Typically, European countries today combine both approaches with the non-constitutional judiciary contained in the regular court system and a separate constitutional court."
336,2020-02-25 23:38:19,f80ecg,"Aha, I see, thanks!"
337,2020-02-26 00:13:29,f80ecg,"To be fair, there wouldn't even have to be an apex court under certain circumstances. 

In Germany, the framers of the Basic Law intended for there to be a *Oberstes Bundesgericht* (federal supreme court) as a court of final appeal in all areas of the law (except constitutional). This court was intended to serve as a unifier of jurisprudence by the specialised federal courts: labour court, social court, administrative court, financial court etc. 

This court was never established. Instead, through its expansive jurisprudence, the Federal Constitutional Court has effectively claimed for itself the power of final review of court decisions on grounds of basic and human rights issues. As our lower courts are not allowed to decide the constitutionality of a law, they refer the case to the Constitutional Court for a decision before proceedings continue. This has contributed to a high level of congruency in German jurisprudence.

The question is whether Europeans would be happy granting such sweeping jurisdiction to the Union Constitutional Court."
338,2020-02-28 11:58:11,f80ecg,"Hum, interesting... In Spain we do have separate high courts (Constitutional and Supreme Courts), which do have separate powers as I think was intended in your Basic Law. It doesn't surprise me, since our Constitution is a massive copy-paste of yours, so... xD"

You love him and he can't see it then thata his loss. You are obviously aware of the situation within your self. Your are able to be who you WANT TO BE! But dont blame who you are now on why some people might not see who you are. I'm sure you're an amazing and wonderful person because according to this post, you have a heart!"
341,2020-02-21 19:25:24,f76v8o," I guess I think that I'm annoying him constantly, and it's probably not the best idea but I've just kinda given up trying to reconnect with him because I feel like he'll push me away again."
342,2020-02-21 19:27:37,f76v8o,"Thank you, this made my morning x100 better :)

Agh, sorry, but would it be much if I tried talking to him about it?"
343,2020-02-21 21:10:14,f76v8o,"From a guys perspective, 
1. It will allow him to see what is going on, but the fall back on that you would have thought he saw it if he cared. I'm not saying totally drop this kid our of your head, because it will be hard.
2. It will allow him to get a grip on your vulnerability and thata the last thing you want. That will create a whole different problem and it wont be nice. 
My honest opinion is to live your life, with or with out those ""friends""  being your self and working on your self will attract a more golden friendship with new people. It's just a matter of time 🤠"

346,2020-02-10 23:47:56,f1z9b2,"I really enjoyed this season. The winner played a great game. We had our first two tiebreaker events, both different! >!And One joined Thomas and Void with the most individual immunity wins, 3!<."
347,2020-02-12 04:55:25,f1z9b2,"I'm glad Al & CJ did great this season. I was hoping Al would win in the end, but I can't deny that Kam made some good moves and really turned things around. She deserved the win!"
348,2020-02-10 23:48:00,f1z9b2,Cap’n was robbed. Only character of mine to win and be a first boot. Glad Clint did well

350,2020-02-11 18:55:11,f1z9b2,Just curious why wasn’t Jain “one” a all star or second chance? He won 3 immunity’s and was a challenge beast?

352,2020-02-12 10:44:06,f1z9b2,Al and CJ were very solid players! Congrats.
353,2020-02-11 20:41:26,f1z9b2,you're right. I updated it

361,2020-04-20 18:21:35,g4xjug,"Gene Upshaw is only 255 pounds at 6'5. As teams fill with more and more MAX players, that is definitely less than ideal.

In practice it probably makes no difference, but it's something to note"
362,2020-04-20 18:45:39,g4xjug,I’m about to get master series Deion and I don’t think he’d fit in with my DBs (CB1-100 Champ CB2- Aqib Nickel-Easter NTL Dime 97 Adams) but my KR is also 100 Hester. So should I replace Hester with Deion or should I somehow fit him in my secondary?
363,2020-04-20 18:58:20,g4xjug,[deleted]
364,2020-04-20 19:56:42,g4xjug,"Would shaquem be better than jamie collins at 3-4? Also, besides tj watt, von(rush) and bobby bell(coverage) are still the best for maxing, and the best at 100 ovr for lb right"
365,2020-04-20 20:29:31,g4xjug,Great guide man. This is an amazing resource! Thanks for putting so much effort into it.
366,2020-04-21 04:04:00,g4xjug,I have atm 98 Fant as TE and 100 little in flex and 100 obj in wr2 and toty julio in wr1. Are they positioned right
367,2020-04-22 18:31:58,g4xjug,What do u think is the best 100 overall mlb besides urlacher and ray Lewis?
368,2020-04-24 05:41:43,g4xjug,"When you say LOLB, do you mean left side on the my team page? Or is it flipped in actuality? Ie should I put my pass rusher on the left or right side of the MLBs?

Side question, do u typically put a MLB or LB at 3-4? Currently have UL Urlacher there"
369,2020-04-27 11:56:24,g4xjug,Nice guide as usual.
370,2020-04-27 22:12:07,g4xjug,Nice
371,2020-05-17 18:06:09,g4xjug,Totally agree on the first one (strahan over upshaw). I have upshaw and I have McDaniel. And the extra acceleration and speed of a maxed OG causes upshaw on pull plays to other shoot the outside linebacker and missed the block every time. I use McDaniel in that spot now instead
372,2020-04-20 18:00:30,g4xjug,"Great write up sman!  I use Calvin, DK, and JuJu, how would you position them?"
373,2020-04-20 18:20:11,g4xjug,"Great guide, thanks for pulling together."
374,2020-04-20 20:19:22,g4xjug,"I honestly don't consider Zeke very good. Saquon Barkley beats him in basically every stat. I would move him down to A tier and move Juju up to A+. Also, Watt is very slightly a better OLB to max than Miller because he's an inch taller and 2 lbs heavier."
375,2020-04-28 01:52:47,g4xjug,Nice
376,2020-04-20 17:52:25,g4xjug,Wait for sure. Never ever buy a player on the first day he’s out
377,2020-04-20 18:25:10,g4xjug," I hate having really fat guards to run into, Upshaw is still tall but is lean. AS FAR AS I KNOW weight doesn't make a difference in blocking."
378,2020-04-20 18:46:41,g4xjug,Replace Hester
379,2020-04-20 19:00:55,g4xjug,I like Wynn and Harris
380,2020-04-21 02:06:00,g4xjug,I'm not 100% but I would say no. I would keep Collins in there
381,2020-04-22 18:33:29,g4xjug,Willis
382,2020-04-24 13:12:58,g4xjug,Left side of the team page. I usually put a MLB at 3-4
383,2020-04-20 18:17:17,g4xjug,"Juju WR 1, DK slot, Calvin WR 2"
384,2020-04-20 20:49:07,g4xjug,"Elliot has better truck, stiff arm, juke, and +2 speed, all important stats. Zeke is at A tier, but I will move Juju up to A+"

387,2020-04-22 04:56:40,g4xjug,"Great reviews bro! H2H.. Would you replace OT Trent or Lane with Wynn? Also thinking about putting Safety Jones at dime for Ramsey. I want to use one of the 100s for max badges, thanks!"
388,2020-04-22 18:59:49,g4xjug,"Thanks if my lbs are 100 watt,100 shazier and 100 bell how should I position them?"
389,2020-04-20 22:46:58,g4xjug,Thanks!
390,2020-04-27 13:55:31,g4xjug,"Not definitely, it's up to preference for sure."
391,2020-04-22 11:23:07,g4xjug,"If you had to use one of them for badges, I would put Wynn over Trent"
392,2020-04-22 19:00:55,g4xjug,"Watt, Bell in 3-4, and Shazier from left to right"
393,2020-04-18 03:57:22,g3gymk,"I'm glad you are safe, but I really hope Billy's parents got him some serious help after this. I do wonder how he got information about which door you normally left from school, but not your home address, thankfully."
394,2020-04-18 18:46:44,g3gymk,"Since you had a SERIOUS attempted kidnapping planned & in process of being carried out, including having police involved with a suspect on drugs & delusional, it would be protective to get information on him just to have on hand in case he should suddenly one day get more crazy & pop up in your life trying to take you again. At least you will have immediate info of his to give to police to keep you safe. Your family & friends would be able to help keep you safe by recognizing him if he came lurking. Making safety steps in advance of needing them is not foolish, it is preventative. Because you never know when crazy comes round again. You will have the information you need to do a no contact order, for when he crosses the line."
395,2020-04-18 16:30:10,g3gymk,"Holly shit. 10/10 reason why I get so paraniod about ""making new friends""  because people are phsycos"
396,2020-04-18 15:22:04,g3gymk,Your family doesn’t have a mailbox?
397,2020-04-18 23:35:46,g3gymk,This is so scary! Glad you are okay!
398,2020-04-19 13:19:59,g3gymk,"First , glad you’re safe. Second, sounds like Billy might’ve been watching you that’s how he knew what door you usually used.  I tell my sisters all the time to be aware of their surroundings. To be vigilant and if something doesn’t look right go another way.  If you see the same car following you every day after school, let someone know. Definitely get this guys info in case he pops up again , the cops will know where to find him. Be safe."
399,2020-04-21 10:52:36,g3gymk,whoa I hope you are safe! that's lucky you didn't run into him
400,2020-04-18 04:03:50,g3gymk,"Yeah, last I heard they tried but he turned 18 and stopped listening to his parents. I’ve thought about that a lot and what would’ve happened if I left out my normal door that day. I wonder if I’d even be here if I had to wait for my mom out where he was"
401,2020-04-18 18:48:57,g3gymk,Oh shit you’re right I will definitely legit look into that
402,2020-04-19 14:25:48,g3gymk,"If you can take out a protective order against him, DO IT.  It wasn't that long ago, and if he's turned 18 and hasn't gotten help, there's a VERY good chance he's still deep in the obsession.  You need to show his picture to everyone you know, make sure that teachers/school employees know who he is, and definitely always be aware of your surroundings.  I hope to god that it's over, but given the level of obsession that developed over one single meeting and a very short period of time, there's a chance that it isn't."
403,2020-04-18 15:22:51,g3gymk,He mailed it to my school because he never was able to find out where I lived thank god
404,2020-04-18 16:18:52,g3gymk,My middle school girlfriend didn't have one either. they just used a P.O. box
405,2020-04-20 15:32:19,g3gymk,Yeah I’ve definitely been way more careful of my surroundings since then
406,2020-04-18 07:28:42,g3gymk,"What was the age difference between you two? It sounds like he was much older.

&#x200B;

However it sometimes feel like things are happy accidents or coincidences, leaving out the door you normally don't."
407,2020-04-18 18:51:27,g3gymk,Be safe. God was looking out for you when you didn't even know it. Because God saw him at the other door. Stay well. :)
408,2020-04-18 10:39:24,g3gymk,He was two years older then me which is a lot for high school I guess but not so much to me
409,2020-04-18 18:54:44,g3gymk,I think about that all the time you’re exactly right
410,2020-04-18 13:39:20,g3gymk,"Sounds like neither of you were old enough to have a relationship,so it's a good thing you got away from him when you did---because he was clearly going insane, for real."
411,2020-04-18 22:01:58,g3dpjj,Very Good
412,2020-04-19 05:08:25,g3dpjj,very cool.
413,2020-04-18 01:48:09,g3c5hw,Problem with Mumkey is precisely that he believes that 2018 and his career is the best thing that ever happened to him. His problems were always there.
414,2020-04-17 23:28:06,g3c5hw,[deleted]
415,2020-04-18 02:54:37,g3c5hw,"It's true, he got fucked over by a lot of people in a lot of different ways, but his downfall was also in part by him as well.

All he can do now is keep his head up and moving forward. I don't really keep up with Mumkey much anymore, but from what I've heard he's in a much better place now than he was a year-ish ago when he posted a video right after the terminations of him having a legitimate breakdown (a real one too, not that made up bullshit like Onision either) because he put down all his chips on Youtube and went broke.

Do I feel bad for him? Sure. Do I also think he's a fucking moron and jackass for screwing over Sheepover? Absolutely. But at the end of it all, there's nothing to gain from dwelling on it, and again - from what I've heard - Tyler seems to understand that (to a degree) and is trying to move onward.

Edit: So I went back to take a look at Simian Jimmy's channel to see how it's doing and truth be told, considering ***everything*** that's happened, he's not doing too bad. Sure, he only has maybe a fifth of his old subscriber base and his videos aren't the same quality, but he could be doing a lot worse for someone in his spot."
416,2020-04-18 05:41:17,g3c5hw,"The thing is that he's been doing fine for a while now and his life changed so much since his channel's termination that I doubt he's still wishing it was 2018 again. At this point I don't think Mumkey could imagine a world where his cats didn't exist and he didn't always have Bigs there to do stuff with. He has grown a lot and had time to reconsider his life choices. His current content is much more niche than it was before, but people who enjoyed him for him are those who continue supporting his work, and so his following remains dedicated. He could always branch out into making more satirical videos, but it's obvious that's not the content he wants to make. If he really wanted to make the videos that got him the wide audience he had aquired, I really think he would have, just at a slower pace. But even the stuff he puts on his main channel is obviously not that. His Anime Review #51 is more of nostalgic callback for his fans than a video someone would find through a random YouTube search and click on for it's attention-grabbing title and thumbnail. If he was back in 2018 as the person he is now, I doubt he'd be as happy continuing to make survival guide videos as he is now."
417,2020-04-18 06:07:16,g3c5hw,"Mumkey was climbing the rope out of the pit. He had gotten so high. He was so high that he was out of the pit, hanging half a meter away from the hook the rope hanged off of. Mumkey bathed in the sun as he had reached a new pinnacle. But as he was about to swing off the ropes snapped and he hurdled down back to the bowels of the pit."
418,2020-04-19 19:50:03,g3c5hw,In a recent livestream Mumkey said that despite everything that has happened he's even happier than he was in 2018. It looks like he's moved on from his mistakes.
419,2020-04-20 09:34:16,g3c5hw,"He still has a chance to make a major comeback on youtube but probably not the way on when he first started. Its pretty clear he's moving away from the style that made him famous, he will still make a satrical and edgy video here and there but he will most likely focus on making documentaries or topics about things he likes like stupid mario brothers or that video from the big brother contestant getting kicked out because those could definitely get him the major views necessary. There has been so many youtubers who have been deleted or kicked out like nostalgia critic, keemstar, and rucka rucka ali and they still are successful to this day. So yeah it sucks what happened to mumkey but he still has a chance."
420,2020-04-18 19:36:41,g3c5hw,It's the oh you are a huge danger to our reputation to fuck off rule (the one that was recently used if Jay station called me and killed me at 3:00pm because at 3:00am he is cutting his grandmother's head off
421,2020-04-17 23:02:38,g3c5hw,Mumkey is a failure with no stable income and a cuck.
422,2020-04-18 07:03:58,g3c5hw,"Horrible circumstances plus life long depression combined with a seeming salvation and experiencing “LSD enlightenment” with create the ultimate pea soup of clouded judgement. Also he was with Lui for most of the time so there wouldn’t be anyone to say that betraying Sheepover for a hebo, women child, degenerate is a fucking horrible idea. And he kept chasing that dragon because of how uplifting that week was."
423,2020-04-18 07:37:59,g3c5hw,When did he say he’s feeling the best he ever has?
424,2020-04-18 00:37:31,g3c5hw,">great, enjoyable content

not even you believe that"
425,2020-04-18 05:22:36,g3c5hw,Check out TM&BS. That has been his focus for the past half year.
426,2020-04-19 20:44:34,g3c5hw,Around what time in the stream does he say it?
427,2020-04-26 08:03:36,g3c5hw,"With Mumkey drifting away from his roots and doing stuff like snack testers, he's starting to remind me of the version of him that was in The Rise Fall and Decay of Mumkey Jones"
428,2020-04-18 15:54:54,g3c5hw,In his 10k subscriber special from less than a week ago. #fakefan
429,2020-04-18 01:11:23,g3c5hw,The mumkey and bigs show is hilarious and I’m not speaking ironically
430,2020-05-17 11:56:23,g3c5hw,whats that?
431,2020-04-19 20:45:23,g3c5hw,I really don't remember sorry
432,2020-04-18 16:26:44,g3c5hw,I don’t watch streams for 2 hours straight
433,2020-05-17 12:04:30,g3c5hw,The Mumkey & Bigs Show. It's pretty much where everything that's not scripted goes.
434,2020-04-24 03:20:24,g3c5hw,"Just listen to them then. I listen to them while I work, clean, cook, shit, shower, masturbate, have sex, drive, eat, piss, sleep, and while watching other mumkey vids. Get your shit together"
435,2020-04-17 11:48:57,g2z07c,"Great analysis. I would say that sometimes the reasons combine themselves, for example mental issues and bullying - Kip Kinkel."
436,2020-04-17 17:38:49,g2z07c,"you should have added seeking fame to the categories, although not super common, it is definitely one of the reasons these things happen."
437,2020-04-17 10:24:58,g2z07c,"I think the only one you got wrong was Harris and Klebold, as a key factor leading to Columbine was because there was so much bullying in the school at the time and no one did anything to stop it, which triggered Harris and Klebold because it was pure injustice for them. There’s also mass shootings that were heavily influenced by other mass shootings, like the Columbine effect. So you should have added those as well as there are plenty of mass shootings that were because the shooter was influenced by others. Like the Kerch College massacre in Ukraine"
438,2020-04-17 19:23:40,g2z07c,I think the only thing your forgetting is notoriety. Combined with a lot of the ones you mentioned above. It's a way for an absolute nobody to be somebody.. In a really fucked up way
439,2020-04-18 01:46:06,g2z07c,"If you read Dr. Peter Langman's books, he found that there were three distinct types of school shooters.  

&#x200B;

Psychopaths - Intelligent, productive, and sometimes even popular. Most often is a bully. See themselves as victim, even though they are almost always the aggressor. 

Often has a physical deformity or some other physical characteristic that renders them feeling severely inadequate. Some with a close male relative that has or had a long successful military or police career.  The shooter sometimes attempts to join the military or police, but is rejected on the grounds of physical deformity.  

Rarest of school shooters. But usually gain the most notoriety with blogs, videos, manifestos, etc... 

Can have success in sports, academics, or dating. But usually inconsistent.  

&#x200B;

Schytzophrenic / Psychotic - Underachiever, very few or no friendships at all , Difficulty communicating. Sometimes a bully, sometimes a bullying victim.

Often has a  close relative who is a very high achiever. Sibling, cousin, etc.. close to their age.    

Little or no success in sports, academics, or dating. There are rare exceptions. 

Often has parent or parents with high levels of education and/or or success in academia.  Or a parent that this a long term government employee. 

&#x200B;

Severely Traumatized  - Underachiever, very few or no long term friendships at all. Chooses not to communicate because of trust issues, but some are intelligent or articulate. Most often the victim of being bullied. 

Often will have an older male relative (hero) who was involved in a public shooting (armed Robbery, hostage situation, active shooter, murder with firearm)  

Extremely unstable home life. Often moves around a lot or in the care of a lot of different relatives\\foster guardians. Most often father completely out of life or is extremely abusive. Sometimes mother too.    

Long term Sexual and/or physical abuse. The shit in Dr. Langman's book was pretty  hard to read. 

&#x200B;

Not every school shooter fits neatly into these categories, but it's pretty amazing how many do. And this is an extremely short summary of his two books. ""Why Kids Kill: Inside the Minds of School Shooters"" and ""School Shooters: Understanding High School, College, and Adult Perpetrators"" They are both very insightful by a professional who was given an incredible amount of access to dairy's, school assignments, school records, medical records, police records, all kinds of writings by the shooters, etc..."
440,2020-04-17 15:03:38,g2z07c,I’d group Elliot Rodgers into mental illness too. I finally got around to reading his manifesto. Dude was a major major major narcissist.  He was a college dropout after taking like 5 classes and dropping most of them because there were girls with boyfriends in them and refused to work jobs that fit people with high school diplomas because they “were beneath him”. He would also just sulk for hours on end because he saw dudes with hot blondes walking about.
441,2020-04-17 21:02:36,g2z07c,what about the cop killers?
442,2020-04-17 13:49:30,g2z07c,"How was anders breivik racist

447,2020-04-17 11:47:47,g2z07c,"Influenced, yes, but still there was to be another underlying issue."
448,2020-04-17 15:42:14,g2z07c,"Many of Eric and Dylans peers, and teachers, refute the whole bullying thing. That was just an excuse the media created. There's been a lot published since then about it."
449,2020-04-17 23:43:43,g2z07c,"Yup. 100%. Notoriety is easily one of the biggest motivations. It actually ties together all the reasons OP laid out. I think OP hit the nail on the head, but you brought it home with your answer."

451,2020-04-17 19:59:00,g2z07c,"The dude gave a fucking Nazi salute in court, tf are you talking about? During his trial, he admitted he was an Odinist National Socialist and not a Christian Zionist or regular conservative like he presented himself in his manifesto."

453,2020-04-17 18:05:54,g2z07c,"I can see the argument both ways, but I think his calling for all Muslims to be deported would factor into his racism"

457,2020-04-17 15:57:13,g2z07c,There are several accounts telling about the bullying
458,2020-04-17 16:07:46,g2z07c,"It’s 141 pages. But it’s an interesting read. He was a weirdo incel for sure but he also had a beyond terrible personality. He thought everyone should just be flocking to him and got mad when girls just didn’t sit on his lap and ask to bang. I think he was pampered so much in his life that led him to behave that way. He was a complete and utter narcissist.

I really don’t get why he thought just sitting and basically staring at people would get them to talk to him. As far as i read he expected people to walk up to him and be his friend."
459,2020-04-18 00:45:25,g2z07c,"Not really unless you find the motivator interesting.

ER wouldve found another cause.

No one in the incel community knew he would do that either, so a lot of people there fucked with him and pushed him"
460,2020-04-17 20:06:27,g2z07c,Why would he say he was a neo con Zionist if he didint mean it that is very damaging to his reputation? And that wasint a nazi salute it was a Christian power sign
461,2020-04-17 18:07:03,g2z07c,He wasint racist he said he just wanted each individual race in their own country he never said he didn't like a race just because of them being that race
462,2020-04-17 15:12:37,g2z07c,So what I am sure if you were to ask him he would say he was a terrorist
463,2020-04-17 16:28:34,g2z07c,Where?
464,2020-04-17 20:14:09,g2z07c,"He wanted to shift the blame on other people so that Nazis don't take the blame IIRC. Also, here's the source where he said that he was a pagan Nazi.

I believe the reason as to why it happened has mostly to do with mental illness and them playing into eachothers homicidal fantasies, but I also think their mental illnesses wouldn't have gotten so out of hand if they hadn't gotten bullied. So, I don't think any kind of bullying was the main reasoning, but it definitely played a part."

484,2020-04-14 06:50:53,g10ffp,"You should check his references yourself, they're generally excellent and taken from official sources, often US media or government documents. Sometimes he doesn't have proper references, and refers you to a book which does. 



For example that the Middle East is considered a stupendous source of strategic power, should be obvious, not only from it's geographical location but it's mineral resources. I'm sure I can find the reference they refer to.


The anti-Chomsky reader is mostly smears and lies. There's 200 points, each of which I could refute if you were interested, but in general I can't say much about them. Couldn't see much truth in there. 


He did once praise China's land redistribution program, which gave land to peasants, for example, that's true. I think it was probably warranted too. The anti-Chomsky guys will think that was a major crime."

487,2020-04-14 07:34:52,g10ffp,What % of the Anti-Chomsky reader is actual valuable criticism? Like 10%?
488,2020-04-14 07:36:03,g10ffp,"Any idea about the Bob Dylan thing? 

And what about the two different ""sins"" that I mentioned in the OP? Does Chomsky commit either of them?"
489,2020-04-14 09:21:49,g10ffp,"Sorry that I didn't format the big quote in the OP properly. It should be broken into paragraphs. 

But what about all the charges that are made in that big quote?"
490,2020-04-14 17:17:13,g10ffp,Nice! How did you find it? Thank you so much!

492,2020-04-14 09:36:55,g10ffp,"Frankly, it's trash, all of it. If there's anything in particular you'd like me to refute, I could. Obviously all 200 points is a mission, and I once set out to do it, but didn't bother. 


It ranges from mild smears to wild outrageous lies. There is a certain agenda running through it, people who support state power hate Chomsky, because he exposes them."
493,2020-04-15 04:11:34,g10ffp,"Generally speaking, it is uncommon for somebody who is debating in good faith to present you with several hundred arguments at once. This tactic is commonly referred to as the ""gish gallop"" and it is specifically intended to overwhelm you."
494,2020-04-14 09:34:58,g10ffp,"I agree with Chomsky, Bob Dylan wasn't interested in politics, and didn't say much on the matter. 


About the sins, not really. His works are excellently and carefully referenced, really. That's my opinion, but feel free to look and judge for yourself."
495,2020-04-14 09:29:19,g10ffp,"I'd have to look at the specific quote which they are referring to, which isn't there ... seems like nitpicking. It's not really a major criticism of his ideology. Having looked at his books, I think his scholarship is generally very careful."
496,2020-04-14 09:52:19,g10ffp,"I'm going to try analyse that full quote, I downloaded the book. Basically the charge made, is that Chomsky misrepresents the Cold War, particularly he underrates the Soviet threat after WW2. 



I mean, this is one of the topics Chomsky has written about the most, and gives a wealth of detail to support his thesis. I highly recommend you download and read ""Understanding Power"" by Noam Chomsky for further details, or let me know and I will quote you further supporting documents and sources.



The US after WW2 was in a position of unprecedented power and reach, basically ever in history. The US was in a position of military supremacy in Western Europe and the Pacific rim, completely dominated them. The US had about 50% of the world's production!


US planners understood that they could dominate most of the world, and set about doing so.


Chomsky is actually a major critic of the Soviet Union, he called it a ""dungeon"", and has often criticized their lack of human rights, authoritarianism etc. But the record shows that, in the period after WW2, the US was far more aggressive and violent in it's foreign empire than the Soviets were.


The sphere of Soviet influence was largely restricted to their immediate surrounds, notable Eastern Europe, and Afghanistan. The US reach, on the other hand was global, spanning the Middle East, Asia and Western Europe. Witness for example the interventions in Vietnam, Iraq, Iran, Italy, Greece, Central and Southern America etc etc.


The Soviets did actually offer Eastern Germany and Berlin to the US, but it was rejected outright, this was in the early 50's."
497,2020-04-14 17:39:11,g10ffp,"Hah to be honest I just looked up ""chomsky bob dylan"""
498,2020-04-14 23:09:38,g10ffp,"I've been looking for it, but to no avail thus far... I want to say it was an interview where he was talking about art and made reference the music as part of the 1960s protest movements, citing Dylan as an example, but the more I think about it, he might have just said ""folk music"" in general.

Interestingly enough, in my search I stumbled upon a [1992 interview](https://chomsky.info/1992____/) where he mentions liking ""old-fashioned"" rock music, which goes against what I've heard him say elsewhere."
499,2020-04-14 10:02:15,g10ffp,"Can you look into the charges that were leveled in the big quote in the OP? Just go CTRL+F in ""The Anti-Chomsky Reader"" for some of the words from the big quote, and you'll find it right away. Its title is ""Chomsky's 'Scholarship'"". It's a short little section, but it produces a lot of charges against Chomsky about the way that he does his citations and stuff, and something at the start about his use of the word ""document"" too. It's all there in the big quote in the OP, but much easier to read if you find the same big quote in the PDF where it's nicely formatted. 

This was the only part of the book that seemed somewhat substantive. Most of total horseshit."
500,2020-04-15 00:56:48,g10ffp,Great find. Good interview!
501,2020-04-14 10:07:52,g10ffp,"I did, it's basically one criticism about one document, and according to this guy it's not ""serious"".


>Chomsky himself refers to in the footnote not as an “important document” but rather as an “important and generally ignored study.”

 

Frankly, I'd recommend you read the books by Chomsky and decide for yourself, I can give you download links. His referencing is generally excellent, he occasionally references himself, but overwhelming it's external sources."
502,2020-04-15 03:50:43,g10ffp,"Ah, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l_F3MShhPs) you go.

They're discussing the role of art in social movements, and he mentions the important role that art such as ""rock music, Bob Dylan (and something unintelligible?)"" had in inspiring young people during the 1960s, while jokingly mentioning his own subjective distaste for it.

Given that context, it seems to me that his point in the other quote, which predates this interview, is simply to illustrate how drugs removed a once ""inspiring"" figure from meaningful struggle and engagement. He almost comes across as disappointed."
503,2020-04-14 17:30:14,g10ffp,"If you look at the two ""sins"" that I laid out in the OP, you'll see that it's not an issue to reference yourself. The issue is when you're INDIRECT about it or CIRCULAR about it. The first is inefficient and wastes the reader's time by sending them through one of your books when you could have just directly referenced another one of your books. The second is genuinely fraudulent since there's no source to be found."
504,2020-04-14 17:33:23,g10ffp,"What is the particular issue in question, maybe I can find a source or you could email if you’re not sure."
505,2020-04-14 17:53:06,g10ffp,"The issue is whether Chomsky committed one or two or the sins below:

It seems like there are two possible ""sins"" in this regard.

The first sin is just to be indirect. So suppose that I have books A, B, C. Suppose that A cites B, and B cites C, and C cites book X that I didn't write. Well, that seems inefficient, like I sent the reader on a wild goose-chase, right? I should not have gone A-->B-->C-->X. I should have just gone A-->C-->X. That cuts out B from the process. There was no reason/rationale to cite B. So that's one possible sin: ""indirect"" citation.

The other sin is far worse: circular citation. In that case, there is no actual outside source. It would be like A-->B-->C-->A. It's circular. In that case, it's fraudulent, because there is no actual external source behind it all. It's a shell game. So that's far worse than the first sin."
506,2020-04-14 18:04:06,g10ffp,"Well look it up yourself, and see if it’s true. Go read the books. I can help you with links. I’m still wondering what the precise assertion was, and if it’s an important one.


From the extensive readings I’ve done e doesn’t seem to commit those sins."

538,2020-04-01 21:22:48,ft0efv,"I'll respond to  **What is something every freshman should know before they start?\***

A lot of freshmen will come into WashU with some serious impostor syndrome. I had it, all of my friends had it, and that feeling doesn't go away quickly (which is normal). Even the people who turned down more prestigious and selective schools for WashU will have it. You'll meet your amazing and accomplished floor mates and hear about how they have this and that award, were valedictorian of their high school, had 10 5's on AP tests and a 1590 on the SAT etc etc. and you'll feel like you're hopelessly outclassed, and that everyone else has their lives completely figured out. You end up feeling like you didn't deserve to get admitted. But the truth is that every single person sitting in your residence hall common floor come orientation is scared *they're* going to be the one who gets outed as a fraud. But what's also true is that no one's a fraud, and that everyone deserves to be here (unless you paid your way in, then screw you). So congratulations!

Also, I'd say regarding OChem that there are a LOT of WashU students who go to a local school or state school to take it over the summer. The ballpark range I've heard floating around is that roughly half of the pre-meds who haven't been weeded out will do this. Most people I know from where I'm from (South SF Bay Area) are choosing to take OChem 1 and 2 at Santa Clara University rather than take it at WashU because it's allegedly easier (which is weird because all the Stanford pre-meds have the same idea as them... ;)). If this is an option to you and you want to preserve your GPA, then go for it. I will warn that it's extremely expensive though (especially if you decide to take it at a private school) and that you'll be missing out on other summer opportunities (although with Covid-19 it could screw over most people anyways with regards to other activities) as your time would need to be exclusively dedicated to grinding the classes out.

Finally, a caveat regarding AP Chemistry credit for Engineers: Engineering allows you to use a 5 on AP Chemistry to get an exception for General Chemistry 1 and 2 and the associated labs should you not want to take it again (as it is quite notorious at WashU). For pre-meds, I have talked to the pre-health dean for Engineering (Ron Laue) about using the credit and he has said it's okay, which *technically* means you can take OChem freshman year. HOWEVER, MANY freshmen do NOT do this because 1) OChem is not easy and probably not the best thing to start off with as a freshman (I did this, it made my first semester a bit crazy even with just 13 units) if you are not familiar with a college environment, and the suggested course of action is to just repeat General Chemistry. If you decide to use your credit, Dean Laue strongly suggests taking other courses freshman year to acclimate to the environment, and to take OChem in the summer or during your sophomore year. 2) Some medical schools may not accept AP credit or only accept it partially (i.e. Harvard accepts one semester and you would need to substitute another inorganic chemistry course such as Physical Chemistry to meet the 1 year of inorganic chemistry requirement, other schools will encourage upper division coursework) , so you should weigh the drawbacks and benefits of such a course of action before making a decision."
539,2020-04-02 15:02:12,ft0efv,"**What made you decide your major/minor? \***

Major I just kind of fell into (I know, not very helpful). For my econ minor, I took a class or two for the distribution and really liked the way it encouraged me to think at a very base level. I thought it would help me in my life/career.

**What are/were some of your favorite clubs? \***

I mentioned this in another post, but:

1. KWUR: Opened up my life to super interesting people who shared a ton of my tastes and became by best friends, was great for my social life in general, was overall amazing, etc. DIY, counter-culture, driven, just an amazing club. It's not all about being on-air, KWUR books shows, throws parties, and does a ton of other stuff.
2. StudLife: Kind of fell into a role here, but being able to have your voice heard without a huge barrier to entry is pretty great. The editors for 4 years have always been open to new ideas and pieces and I don't think that'll change. Buncha nice people.
3. Rugby: Great sport, and sort of acted as a fraternal organization for someone not involved in greek life. I eventually quit because I wasn't in love with getting smashed up every Tuesday and Thursday but the moral of the story is that clubs, and sports clubs in particular, are an *amazing* social resource. Try something new, you won't regret it.

**What is something every freshman should know before they start?\***

Wait to buy textbooks until the first day of class unless you're told otherwise by a trusted source. Stay hydrated. You don't need to be in the library all day, or ever, everyone studies differently. St. Louis is a bastion of food, drink, and cool shit - it's easier to get around in a car, but don't be afraid to branch out. Coming from a high school with minimal guidance, my 4-year adviser was an amazing resource. This may not be true for you, but reach out to your 4-year and major advisers because who knows!

**What is your favorite on-campus food?\***

Stir fry, custom sandwiches at Stanley's and Cherry Tree, mozz sticks (do they still have them on Fridays?), burrito bowls. Not on campus but close enough: Seoul Taco, Salt & Smoke, Mission Taco, BoBQ, Corner 17

**Describe the students here\***

I would say the plurality of students are.... overwhelmingly Normal, fairly wealthy people from suburban Chicago/LA/NY. Not to say that's always a terrible thing (most are good people! I'm from suburban NY!) but if you're into The Office laptop stickers and Walk the Moon you're in good hands. We're not exactly Sarah Lawrence. On the upside, 7,000+ undergrads means that you can find basically **any** type of community you're looking for. I did and I had a *wonderful* 4 years."

542,2020-04-25 07:23:09,ft0efv,"Is it easy to internally transfer to other departments/colleges? Also, how early can you transfer (after one or two semesters)? I got accepted from the waitlist into the McKelvey School of Engineering. I would probably want to transfer into Arts and Sciences. Thank you!"
543,2020-04-01 22:27:09,ft0efv,"Here are some things that I feel may need corrections:

"" Typically if you're a pre-med it's safe to skip calc 1 and 2 with AP Calc BC, and even nicer with AP stats. For most med schools this is enough math"", I think the for most med schools this is enough math can be misleading. Some med schools require at least a semester of math to be taken in college and won't count an AP unless you do so.

&#x200B;

Cornerstone is no longer cornerstone and has rather broke into the teaching center and the learning center. One of which is located in the gargoyle and the other in the cornerstone spot on the 40.

547,2020-04-01 22:46:48,ft0efv,of course!! What do you want me to add?
548,2020-04-27 20:49:16,ft0efv,It should be very easy. I know people who transferred from Engineering to ArtSci and vice versa. You most likely can transfer in freshman year. Transferring to different departments is easy: you would meet with your 4-year advisor and go from there.
549,2020-04-02 01:35:21,ft0efv,"Actually, the Teaching Center is not new this year, and has been around for awhile, located in Eads. Cornerstone split into the Learning Center and Disability Resources. The Learning Center, as well as some other departments, are where the Gargoyle used to be, and Disability Resources is still located on the ground floor of Gregg."
550,2020-04-01 22:33:01,ft0efv,"Wait the gargoyle, still exists?"
551,2020-04-02 10:29:54,ft0efv,I went on a roommate Finder website and it went well. But going random can also be really fun since everyone who goes to Washu is going to be very smart and unique. I’m just has a personal preference to know them a little than fully random
552,2020-04-03 16:35:29,ft0efv,"CS has a very manageable courseload as far as engineering majors go. Reasonable set of core courses and then a bunch of varied electives. Distribution requirements are very reasonable too. Very easy to walk out with a minor in something else. Professors are mostly solid and the program is growing and changing incredibly quickly, for better or for worse."
553,2020-04-15 15:14:48,ft0efv,You would have to look at the specific math major and see if you can use those credits since it’s different for every major!

556,2020-04-17 04:33:17,ft0efv,Hi! May I ask how doable it is to double major in bio and computer science?
557,2020-04-02 18:12:53,ft0efv,"I'm not an Olin student! I think you should post this separately and I can add a specific olin FAQ based on the responses there, unless you can answer these questions :)"
558,2020-04-18 00:23:00,ft0efv,"The first two years are honestly just making your way through Olin requirements, so like it or not you won't be able to be too choosey with bschool courses. You'll have some free space for non-bschool classes to fulfill your distribution requirements, so this is a great opportunity to explore your interests outside of business.

The classes aren't more difficult per se, but it is challenging to keep yourself accountable. You may fall into the tendency to procrastinate since assignments seem to be so far apart and a class is just two days a week, so be wary of falling into this trap.

Lemme know if you have any other questions."
559,2020-04-25 00:07:59,ft0efv,"Hey, don’t know too much about bio specifically but as someone double majoring in cs and math most likely it is very doable. Start out your first semester doing the intro classes for both majors (or above intro classes if you have AP credit or whatever) and then if you decide down the road that you don’t want to do both majors it’ll be fine... the only big mistake would be to rule it out early on and not take the necessary courses, and then have to either not do one of them or have to take more classes per semester than you are comfortable with."
560,2020-04-02 21:14:27,ft0efv,"thanks, that'd be great!"
561,2020-04-18 17:46:55,ft0efv,thanks for your response! so you're basically saying that the lower level b school courses aren't necessarily difficult but what makes them difficult is just staying on top of all of them?
562,2020-04-25 18:56:17,ft0efv,I see! I’m majoring in computational biology so hopefully some of the course requirements for both CB and CS will overlap! thanks for the advice

590,2020-04-25 18:57:17,g7yt15,"Yeah, I don’t think Powers would necessarily have wanted a film adaptation of his work, let alone one reappropriated for another franchise. Hence why he refused to collaborate. After all, we know how good Disney is with adaptations... Also, authors never really want film adaptations of their work, because they get nearly everything wrong. So, in all likelihood, it’s a 20 : 80 gamble."
591,2020-04-25 18:59:28,g7yt15,"It might have.
Never know, it might have made it better. Not saying it was not good, because it was just wish the writers would have tried harder and paid better attention to details."
592,2020-04-26 06:46:25,g7yt15,"That would imply the deficiencies with the film were due to the screenplay, and not the studio hiring the worst living director."
593,2020-04-26 03:21:46,g7yt15,"Elliot and Rossio have lost their way in recent years. They aren’t even collaborating anymore and one of them is an anti-vaccination conspiracy theorist. It’s a really disappointing point in their careers.

Edit: Not sure who is downvoting this but nothing I've said has been untrue.

Elliot hasn't written a movie since The Lone Ranger, which while I will defend is far from perfect. Meanwhile, Rossio has gone on to write a few shorts, Godzilla vs Kong, and Johnny Quest without Elliot.

Rossio tweeted that ""Anti-vax is equivalent to calling someone a n-word [only he said the actual word]."" He then deleted the tweet."
594,2020-04-25 19:12:55,g7yt15,I would agree with that. I though Blackbeard's arc was boring personally and he was a poor villain compared to Davy Jones/Beckett/Barbossa in the previous trilogy.
595,2020-04-25 02:13:42,g7il55,"Elliot Rogers had a total and complete lack of perspective. He was incredibly babied and entitled. I partly blame his parents for never forcing him to live a life of hardship and disappointment like we all do, because it teaches you humility. He never had that. He felt like he deserved anything he wanted. He felt that by going to UCSB and driving a bmw he was entitled to get laid without ever understanding that he was a creepy douchebag that no one wanted anything to do with. He died an angry incel and took some good people out with him. Fuck that guy"

I understood the decision of revoking publication of it (at the time, shortly after), but at the same time, I'm fervently against censorship. I do worry that banning it only made reading it more irresistible to the very audience that people hoped to deny access. Kind of like an obscenity trial only serves to popularize the questioned work."
598,2020-04-28 00:22:21,g7il55,"He appeared to have a very skewed perception of the world. I believe it was due to combination of his limited social interactions with other people, but also I'm 90% sure he had some kind of mental disorder that caused him to view the world in such a drastic light. For example, his belief that if he simply dressed nice and walked around where girls could see him, that he would have girls approaching him in no time. Wtf?"

They have his interrogation video available to watch. The detective is just trying to get pretext so they can rule out the insanity plea in court and lock him up forever. 

The cop is being super friendly and nice to get him to confess to motive and his mind set at the time. 

He of course denys that he had problems anywhere in his life and eventually the cop says something to the effect of ""I've been at this a long time and you look to me like someone with Special Needs."" It's has to be the nicest way I've ever heard someone tell another they are retarded."

And they didn’t seem to mind that he was such an evil bastard. In fact, I bet they liked him for it. This is how girls are, and I was starting to realize it. This was what truly opened my eyes    to  how brutal the world is. The most meanest and depraved of men come out on top, and women flock to  these men. Their evil acts are rewarded by women; while the good, decent men are laughed at. It is sick, twisted, and wrong in every way. I hated the girls even more than the bullies because of this. The sheer cruelty of the world around me was so intense that I will never recover from the mental scars. Any experience I ever had before never traumatized me as much as this.

This is the only part of his writings that I resonated with. A female friend and the first girl I kissed fucked the guys that tortured me. The only girl that has ever asked me out, did so after I punched a bully in the face. Lots of women write Ted Bundy and James Holmes love letters in prison etc.

&#x200B;

So to clarify since people want to pm me and say if thats the worst thats happened then im a fucking pussy.  I've also been stabbed, beaten with bats and pipes, held at gunpoint, gun pointed at my head and penis, machete over my hand about to chop it off, house robbed and set on fire, all at the hand of my own friends and family, 2 random people pointed guns at me

Just the way he talks, it’s so arrogant. 


“*There were some actors and celebrities on the carpet with us, and the paparazzi yelled at me a few times to get out of the way as they were taking pictures of some cunt actress. I discreetly gave those paparazzi pigs my middle finger. Elliot Rodger will not move aside for a stupid, good-for-nothing, over-glorified actress, whoever the fuck she was. I didn’t see.*”"
633,2020-04-25 00:53:56,g7ijjc,he was also a racist
634,2020-04-25 11:16:54,g7ijjc,Not at all
635,2020-04-25 04:44:52,g7ijjc,"Probably a combination of genetics and his environment. There’s a ton we don’t know about the brain and why we do the things we do, so it’s hard to pinpoint where he might have went wrong. 

I’m not a professional, so I can’t diagnose Elliot obviously. My guess is maybe he had a severe form of depression, or he could have had NPD (Narcissistic Personality Disorder). The latter would explain the huge ego and the general lack of empathy for most people, besides some of his family and friends."
636,2020-04-25 06:45:50,g7ijjc,"Yeah he was a good writer and I enjoyed reading his text. Of course I don't condone what he did and don't deny anything OP has said, but I went into it more to understand than to judge and found it a compelling read. I think Elliot could have been a writer (as he wished) if he wanted to."
637,2020-04-25 01:13:17,g7ijjc,There’s always [this](https://youtu.be/lh37hicmiAY)
638,2020-04-25 09:33:53,g7ijjc,"I totally agree. Yeah maybe Aspergers but i certainly have traits (waiting for an assessment which is taking a very long time due to demand and financing in the UK) and could never do this to anyone what he did. I’m in my 30s, adult female, not a virgin but find it hard to find a partner, but that’s an issue with me, why take it out on anyone else? That’d be awful and unfair to them. 

Nah he certainly had co-morbidities and show narcissism too."
639,2020-04-25 07:13:34,g7ijjc,Probably wouldn't have made it better. It was his thoughts and mindset that fucked him up.
640,2020-04-25 00:57:17,g7ijjc,"It starts off boring in my opinion, he goes through childhood memories. 

When you get to the part called “Stuck in the Void” he starts really complaining, and it gets increasingly ridiculous towards the end of the document. Then it’s just downhill from there. If you like reading pages full of self pity, hate, and dumb decisions you’ll enjoy it. 

The lottery part was hilarious."
641,2020-04-26 01:01:31,g7ijjc,Him struggling doesn’t excuse his actions or his ridiculously stupid ideology.
642,2020-04-25 10:24:01,g7ijjc,"Eh I wouldn’t say gifted and I wouldn’t say good. He had potential as a writer and if he actually took the time to actually work on his writing (and chose better subjects) he could have got somewhere.

He just wanted to magically be amazing at everything and didn’t want to put in that work. He had many opportunities and parents with connections for jobs which they actually found for him. He refused to start at the bottom and felt the jobs beneath him. If he’d had stuck to it all, with those connections, he would have got somewhere. Maybe would have managed to find a girlfriend too if he had got over himself and hadn’t looked down on the women who would have been interested. 

But gifted? Nah. With time maybe. But he was too impatient and too full of himself."

649,2020-04-25 04:02:20,g7ijjc,"He was a major narcissist, possibly a sociopath."
650,2020-04-25 09:25:38,g7ijjc,I have read that he was autistic as well but was in denial about it.
651,2020-04-25 17:01:54,g7ijjc,As he shouldn't have
652,2020-04-25 16:28:48,g7ijjc,lol read on it

And ya that’s a condensed version. Two hour version is also available somewhere on YouTube"
661,2020-04-26 04:53:50,g7ijjc,"I see, thanks. It is interesting how that early in the interview, Minassian was barely answering any questions...but after a while he started opening up. The detective did a good job of getting him to speak."
662,2020-04-25 09:29:33,g7ijjc,"He didn't listen on purpose, she came home with her boyfriend and didn't know he was home  I dont blame him for being pissed about that"
663,2020-05-02 07:31:31,g7ijjc,I’m surprised you can read. Too simple
664,2020-04-25 01:03:33,g7ijjc,"Not very. About 136 pages. 


https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/1173619/rodger-manifesto.pdf"
665,2020-04-26 01:38:53,g7ijjc,No. If anything he disliked himself because he was partially of Asian descent. Elliot was a known racist.
666,2020-04-25 14:53:14,g7ijjc,Lol. Found the next ER
667,2020-04-25 18:14:04,g7ijjc,I know you're a victim of bullying and whatnot but chill out with slurs.
668,2020-04-26 05:45:05,g7ijjc,"Yeah he did a good job. Though Minadsian clearly wasn't aware of what the officer was doing because of his autism. 

It's really a very common technique to build rapport with the person they are interviewing/interrogating. If you just go straight to asking about the crimes they will lock up just like you see in the start. People with experience would just be quite and then ignore the person questioning until they lawyer is in the room

Though in this case he wasn't even looking for a confession. There was no question to if he had done it. The detective is try to prove he might be mentally I'll, but he is still  clearly know what he was doing and planned it. Ruling out a physcotic break that could could convince the judge or jury to believe he is not criminally responsible because of insanity. which could mean he would eventually be released. 

Here is a great channel on youtube that does criminal psychology break downs of interrogations like this. In fact they even have a break down of this interview, but it's behind a 1 dollar pay wall on Patreon now.
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYwVxWpjeKFWwu8TML-Te9A
There are several videos on youtube still though. And 1 includes the detective interviewing a child rapist/murder and you should see how his tone changes.

He is still very polite, though in the Minasian questioning he was also being very careful not not do anything at all that could be construed as bullying or coering him due to his low social skills. Not so much for the the pedo Michael Rafferty. 

There is also a video of questioning the Canadian Air Force colonel Russle Williams who was stalking, raping, and ultimately murdering women in around his homes. The officer who is super nice to the colonel to get the confession, and body locations. Though he makes an appearance in the Micheal Rafferty interrogation the chew his ass out and play bad cop saying the officer who questioned Alek was his only chance. The child murdering pedo ends up crying like a bitch. At one point Raffery is hyper ventilating and reaching and the Alek cop is like ""oh, it's ok I'll grab you a trash can. There you got."" Then starts asking him about it again. 

Then finally there isn't much of a break down of it, but the Jerred Murray confession is nuts. Think the alek questioning, except the small town sheriff doesn't need to coax him to explain it. He just straight through exavtly what he did with no feeble attempt to not incriminate himself like alek did in the start.
https://youtu.be/0egkEZCEwTk 
Also it's weird as hell, but they must of put his ass on a diet in the psychiatric hospital because he lost like a 100 plus pounds. Looks like I between 250-300 at the time of the murder and down the like 150 in his court pictures. 

Goddamn that was long. Though is a rabbit hole or two to go down. Also if something I wrote doesn't make sense I can clarify."
669,2020-04-25 05:56:52,g7ijjc,"Holy fucking shit.... you were not exaggerating in the slightest... he really, I mean like really, overestimated how interesting and amazing he thought he was to the rest of the world. I mean the only reason we’re talking about him is because of what he did, but dude even just reading through this I cringe at how he placed himself and his “magnificent story” on the highest of pedestals. Jfc. What a narcissist. 

I just can’t even begin to understand why girls, or just any and all people in general, couldn’t stand the guy... so misunderstood! 

And that is with a very hard /s.

Edit: Not that long at 136 pages he says lol. I’m just kidding I know that’s probably not very long compared to other “manifestos” but it seems like a fucking novel when it’s this dude writing about himself. It actually reads like a joke memoir they’d use in a movie;

“Well, it all started when I was born...” 

*scroll down like 20 long ass paragraphs* 

“So there I was, a young boy at just the age of 5...” 

Buckle in, folks."

Yea the dude was evil but something about people like you  taking  joy  of his suffering irks me it's one thing  to detest   him but it's  something else when you consider  it  a non stop joke to something that led to a massacre   , but you like r/inceltears so there you go."

It's very non-traditional in a lot of ways, and that's something I really appreciate. I'm a strong believer that poetry should be based out of raw emotion and the state of individuality or society as a whole, and I think in a lot of ways its a mix of all three.  Personal emotion on how damaging these types of phrases are to those struggling especially during our lives matter line, societal emotion on how these people praising something like all lives matter are causing damage in the world, and the overall raw emotion of feeling like this has to be written and said and called out because of the damage of others. I don't really have any changes I can say you can make, but I really hope you keep posting and writing, this was enjoyable and like I said, very topical, and I think I'd personally enjoy to read more poems like this."

702,2020-06-15 14:07:28,h91si5,"> He was talking about how he hates Castlevania because of some guy on Reddit. I guess some guy has a novelty account about some Castlevania character.  
  
Yep, that's me. I can't believe I'm causing him to seethe this much in real life. All because I was calling him a pedo, and now it turns out he is.  
  
> He was talking about how he was some dumb BJJ jockbro and how they are so weak compared to bodybuilders (says a guy who is fat).  
  
Despite the fact that BJJ guys can choke out bodybuilders with ease? I choked out guys bigger than me. I hope this guy spends an hour in MMA gyms, we lifted weights and shit. Trust me, we aren't weak anyway."

He was saying how Reddit keeps being Fascist because of it, but I get the feeling that since he openly lusts over Saigiri (Eromanga Sensei) and her “cute little body” and how much he wants to “spread her legs” or something along those lines (and yes he actually said that on Facebook), I think it’s something else.🤔"
715,2020-06-15 17:27:25,h91si5,He really is that delusional.

is this real life?

ich verstehe es nicht."
719,2020-06-14 21:49:16,h91si5,How do you keep finding the accounts? Why isn’t he on 4chan where people will actually feed into his shitty opinions and he can leave everyone else alone? I have so many questions.
720,2020-06-15 18:02:50,h91si5,"I am calling you out as a fake. I know you are actually a male neckbeard posting this to make it seem like women totally support Final Fantasy 7’s cursed existence. What woman even likes Tifa or even considers her “goals” at all?  
  
And that incident with the cheerleaders where an incel blew himself up was caused by Final Fantasy 7. A bombing mission was a part of the game where you kill innocent people. That is terrorism. Final Fantasy 7 causes incel terrorism.  
  
I’m sorry to tell you this but women absolutely hate characters like Tifa, the only people who like Tifa are neckbeards, so it stand to reason that you are actually a neckbeard.  
  
Final Fantasy 7 is the neckbeardiest thing imaginable."
721,2020-06-15 21:38:54,h91si5,"Oh yeah. Funny thing is about his online life, he never seems to comment on here, not once. I was expecting at least one comment calling me an impostor, but he is strangely silent. I guess he knows he will get torn apart in this thread."
722,2020-06-24 16:47:18,h91si5,I...have no idea what you’re talking about.
723,2020-06-14 23:27:20,h91si5,I have a feeling 4chan would troll him big time.
724,2020-06-24 17:10:37,h91si5,"The way he talks openly about tiny Asian girls and muscles is the primary identifier. Trust me, I would know that."
725,2020-06-15 18:49:31,h91si5,"I have no idea what you’re talking about. How does FFVII cause incel terrorism? I’ve played the original back when I was younger and I didn’t bomb anything at all.  
  
Also a lot of my female friends loved Tifa and Aerith. I have no idea what you’re taking about. Lots of women I know say they wish they could look like Tifa.  
  
Also I am an actual woman, why would I lie about that on the Internet?  
  
You’re either delusional or a dedicated troll. I’m hoping it’s the latter."
726,2020-06-15 21:49:47,h91si5,"That’s odd. He seems to be the kind that feeds on attention, negative or positive. I would think he’d be all over here."
727,2020-06-14 23:44:04,h91si5,"But if we make him believe they won’t, then we will be rid of him lol"
728,2020-06-15 19:16:57,h91si5,"Incels will lie about being women online who totally supports incel ideology, I will not fall for it.  
  
The character of Tifa is degrading to women everywhere. Final Fantasy 7 treats women as objects and has an angry incel with a small penis as a main character. This whole story of you playing Final Fantasy 7 and not being a terrorist is definitely a /r/thathappened fodder of an anecdote.  
  
The age of Japanese games is over, no one plays Final Fantasy anymore. It’s not popular enough. The Last of Us 2 not only depicted women better, it is also more feminist friendly as compared to Violent Incel Fantasy 7.  
  
It’s about time you moved on, people think you are a weirdo neckbeard for praising Final Fantasy 7. You do realize that the game has no right to exist. It was made by an angry basement dwelling virgin who couldn’t get a woman because he is single and hasn’t been laid at all. Time to get over it. Japanese games are bad and so are the players for buying into it, eventually going down the alt right rabbit hole.  
  
I can speak for all the women here and say that you seem like an incel."
729,2020-06-15 22:59:06,h91si5,Well I guess he knows he might be in trouble here. Who knows?

I’ve never really cared for TLOU2, or any zombie games for that matter. It just doesn’t appeal to me, that’s it.  
   
Also, are you saying that Tifa isn’t feminist friendly? You do realize she could kick ass. I like that.  
  
You sound really racist. You’re saying “the age of Japanese games are over” you do realize they are still making good games, right?  
  
If liking fun games makes me a neckbeard incel or whatever, then fine, I’ll gladly break up with my boyfriend over vidya. (Kidding ofc)  
  
Sorry Final Fantasy VII triggers you so much."

Shut up! We already established that you are a neckbeard pretending to be this pure innocent Asian girl who totally likes scrawny white guys. Totally not exposing your thought process of an incel.  
  
Final Fantasy 7 has triggered women everywhere, they got triggered when they realize that the neckbeards salivate over Tifa. They saw Tifa’s unrealistically proportioned body and went into a dark pit of anorexia just to look like her when it is obvious nobwoman looks like that.  
  
Then we get Columbine. You do realize that Final Fantasy 7 causes Columbine to happen. Anyone that denies that is automatically an incel.  
  
Just because a game is fun doesn’t mean that it is good for you or society."
734,2020-06-15 20:01:33,h91si5,"You haven’t established shit dude. Also, I am not some neckbeard depicting some perfect waifu, I am an actual woman.  
  
If any woman goes into anorexia because of Final Fantasy, the problem is with the individual, not the game itself, okay?  
  
Women also look like Tifa as well. She isn’t “unrealistic” just google “bikini model” and see what I mean.  
  
So are we back on the violent video games causing violence debate again? What is this, the early 2000’s? Okay Jack Thompson."

And sorry to tell you this, but Final Fantasy 7 causes women to go into depression and even suicidal, and yes it is the game creator’s fault, because he did not take responsibility for his actions at all, and one day Final Fantasy 7 will be banned in America for this reason. Freedom of Speech does not mean freedom from consequences.  
  
And I’m not saying that violent video games literally causes violence, but if the game in question has messages that you should engage in terrorist activity and kill innocent people.  
  
Time for you to get over it. Final Fantasy 7 was created in the times when incel propaganda was at an all time high. It is too bad you can’t get over my opinions. You are the one who is triggered over my opinions. You are the one who is angrily disagreeing with my opinions. You are the one spilling your tendies because you love incel propaganda.  
  
Get over it."

Even then, if FFVII should be banned, then so should The Last of Us 2, you do realize these things will bite you in the ass in the end.

He was a highly effective administrator increasing the wealth of Prussia through industrialization; a shrewd diplomat instigating the first partition of Poland and connecting the lands of Brandenburg and East Prussia.

He was one of the greatest commanders of the era, his victories at Rossbach and Leuthen are considered tactical masterpieces.

And he was also a world class flute player, composing hundreds of sonatas and four concertos for the flute."

The argument that CF people are lazy and not contributing to society is stupid.

I have low energy most days even on my good days.

Instead, these people could study now to work on a cure, or give money to finance a cure, or help kids and young people who already exist and would like to study science (with tutoring, scholarships, free meals, etc).

Having a kid themselves is the slowest and laziest way to go about it if they're so concerned about finding a cure."

848,2020-06-13 20:13:54,h82sr9,And based on David’s essays on their childhood I can kind of understand why. It sounds like they had a very lively but also somewhat chaotic upbringing.

1. My offspring is too young

Or

2.At least I have helped ensure the survival of our species.

865,2020-06-13 15:16:37,h82sr9,"As a Catholic, I grew up believing she was an amazing saint. Until I heard about one story of a 15 year old girl that was raped by her uncle (or another family member) and she was pregnant. She talked to Mother Teresa about the situation and told her her mother and her were on their way to get an abortion, so it would be nice if she could do a prayer for the young girl. Apparently, Mother Teresa lectured the young girl into keeping the baby otherwise it’s sinful to kill the baby despite where it came from. 

After hearing that story, it broke my heart to the 15 year old that was a victim and was essentially victim blamed for not wanting the kid. I stopped idealizing mother Teresa at that point."
866,2020-06-13 22:32:54,h82sr9,">At least I have helped ensure the survival of our species.

That's where I'd go full autism and make them justify why they're assuming such thing is desirable. Life is ultimately meaningless so the only reasonable thing to do is enjoy it however we want, there is no argument to be made for perpetuating our species unless you bring religion into the debate. 

I've also been thinking lately that since no one can consent to being born, it's not even ethical to have offspring. Life has its good moments, I'm not nihilistic, but it is hard and painful most of the time and they want to put someone into this mess just because they can't deal with our individual existence being finite so they go for the next best thing (creating a legacy)? 

Curious that we CF are the selfish ones, to me it's quite the opposite, specially considering that they know for certain that raising a child (properly) is so complicated that they're guaranteed to mess it up somewhere sometime.

Sorry for the rant lol"

You have probably helped with the destruction of our species by over populating, which means killing the planet our species lives on."

870,2020-06-13 20:27:12,h82sr9,"Good point! I hadn't thought of that, because I would not feel responsible for something someone else achieved, even if it was my kid (I don't have any anyway)."

887,2020-06-13 07:39:10,h81ymm,"Oof I’m the same age as him lol

My guess: the Heritage Foundation and/or groups close to them. They have a thing for platforming terfs and detransitioners to say “here’s a lesbian/former trans person to tell you that trans is bullshit.”"
888,2020-06-15 00:10:26,h81ymm,"Not just to support TER-ism, but misogyny and sexism in general--e.g., the reason that there are fewer women in STEM is because women naturally just aren't that interested in STEM, not because there's been systemic pressure against women in STEM fields."

What was weird is that he started off really well. Got to 44, missed a black off the spot and then fell apart. The rest of that first match was pretty dreadful. 

He was much better by the end of the day"

945,2020-05-30 00:25:04,gt4dh4,"I’d have preferred a JL matchup, the main four (Supes, WW, Bats, Flash) against the Cats. Mxyz is a good choice for the setup - or some Mumm-Ra summoning gone awry. Trouble is the same as usual: Superman is nigh-invincible except against magic weapons. But it gets worse because Bats edges Panthro, Flash is faster than Cheetara, and Tygra and his bolo is an easy out for Diana.    
Hm, you’d need to make Third Earth entirely a magic realm like a Narnia, and thus some of Supes’ powers either are gone or don’t work as well.  
I think the language barrier was a good idea. 
No way around the Flash & WW dominance."
946,2020-05-30 22:38:20,gt4dh4,"...wasn't the biggest fan of the Superman/'cats crossover, nor the Battle of the Planets/'cats crossover either.

947,2020-06-17 22:24:21,gt4dh4,I loved the first Battle of the Planets crossover. Wilykit and Keyop were kinda adorable together.
948,2020-05-30 00:46:46,gt4dh4,"One of my favorite Marvel comics of the 80s was some sort of What If? What The? But not the funny one, more about Marvel - so maybe Marvel Presents. Anyways, a Marvel editor or writer pointed out what was wrong with all the proposed Marvel-DC crossover ideas coming from DC. 

He said pretty much the same thing about Quicksilver vs. The Flash. Quicksilver could run like 220 mph, whereas Flash could harness time travel. All of the DC heroes were overpowered compared to their Marvel counterparts with Superman trashing Thor and so on. I loved that it was a Marvel writer who was the one pointing out how powerful the DC characters were. 

Thought you would appreciate that, because that's what you've just done as well. It's interesting to me that the Thundercats seem to have more heart because there was a lesson in each episode. I thought ""Identity Crisis"" was excellent and enjoyed reading Alan Moore's collection of DC stories, but with the Thundercats music and cohesiveness, I think it's the stronger single body of work. Not even the point, but I don't have much to think about DC & Thundercats together."
949,2020-05-30 00:52:49,gt4dh4,I like that even better -- a meeting between the Justice League and ThunderCats.

951,2020-06-15 01:21:33,gt4dh4,"Uh......the He-Man/ThunderCats comic was poorly written by people that understood NEITHER property. While the Superman crossover wasn't any good, the Battle of the Planets crossover was LEAGUES better than the He-Man one."
952,2020-05-30 00:53:10,gt4dh4,That's absolutely cool!

It's funny dragging all the notions about characters that the fandom has and then re-contextualizing those notions in a radically different setting.

Like now Harry Potter is a barista and Draco Malfoy is that one obnoxious customer who treats Harry like shit but secretly has a crush on him and Minerva is the strict-but-fair assistant manager who keeps cutting Harry's shifts and Tom Riddle is the evil corporate whatever, etc. etc.

I mean, are they? Quite a few of them are trying to be about a TINO transported into an alternate dimension loosely based on some other setting, like Azeroth or Wizarding Britain.

> They take place in Worm and at least make a vague attempt to do Wormy things or use Worm's characters. 

What is a ""wormy thing""? Like, is it body horror, is it a cascading series of cliffhangers, is it going for a morning run and ogling a cute boy?

And I'm not sure how much effort goes into the use of Worm's characters, at that.

> They're at least in the world of Worm, you know? It may not be good, but it's at least trying to move in that direction. 

Is it tho? Like, that's the thing. It seems, and I don't want to put words in your mouth here, but it does like what you're really saying is that if certain forms are followed then you, personally, can squint hard enough to pretend it's more Worm? Which is, yanno, valid, just, not the best lens for critique, IMO.

> I also categorically reject that Life Bends Down's characters are similar to the Worm ones. 

Lemme ask: have you read much of LBD? Cause I think this is actually something that takes a while to fully appreciate. 

> Too much is different and too many pieces of vital history and backstory are gone, not to mention the powers that mold and shape the characters so much. 

Which of the vital pieces of backstory are gone, again?

> Potentially pretty writing doesn't salvage that. If you want to write about Worm characters, write in Worm. Don't put up a pretense that it's Worm in spite of not being Worm.

I mean, ShayneT and RavensDagger do okay."

> It's tedious to have to shift through larger fandoms where the whole thing is incredibly prevalent. 

I will agree that the lack of suitably robust archival and search tools make quite a few ficdoms challenging to navigate. Would that we could all easily and intuitively find exactly the subset of fics we want to find.  

The ponies have a leg up on most others, in this regard.

> I go have a look at let's say Supergirl, because I want to read about an Alien struggling to fit in with humanity, yet all I find are stories where she is human and working in a coffee shop. 

Aight but like, wouldn't Invisible Man scratch this itch just as well? What is it about the nominal alien, vs the alienation?

Think maybe this is getting too caught up on labels.

Teddy Roosevelt's biography has some pretty darn fantastical elements in it, ijs.

How you get to a similar end via different means is part of the fun, I'd say. Tho some folks wanna look at other stuff and just make ""basically the same person"" part of the givens. I'm sure there are at least as many poorly characterized nominal alien versions of Supergirl in that ficdom.

> Why is Ned Stark a hard faced warrior who saw almost his entire family die in brutal ways when in the story he works as a fucking *lawyer* in *New York?*

Maybe he grew up elsewhere? Like, a non-zero number of folks in the world have had their family killed brutally and then gone on to succeed in a profession later in life. 

> The same is true of Worm even more, where people and society in general are shaped by the oppressive sense of hopelessness from the setting.

The thing is, you're examples are all ""well how about"" when the authors don't bother with it. The characters are the same when their entire backgrounds have changed, yet there is nothing in those new backgrounds that justifies the characters being that way. 

>Aight but like, wouldn't Invisible Man scratch this itch just as well? What is it about the nominal alien, vs the alienation?

Because the premise of the world that the fic is based on is ""alien fitting in and doing superhero stuff""...? That's why I'm reading fic about the setting, because the source material is something that interests me... If it wasn't I wouldn't be looking up fic about it. 

>I'm sure there are at least as many poorly characterized nominal  alien versions of Supergirl in that ficdom.

Of course there is trash, all fandoms are full of trash. It's Sturgeon's Law, 90% of everything is trash. I just don't understand the desire to get into a world and then strip out everything about that world except for the names of the characters.

1034,2020-05-24 04:15:03,gp1b3t,"Here's the thing.

You're not the first person to come into a LBD fic rec thread to express you don't like/don't understand the genre, argue with people about what constitutes a Wormfic, accuse the fic itself for being insulting to real geeks and fans, be concerned about the genre overwhelming other fandoms, then backpedal with 'I don't actually care, just do whatever, I only care about whether it's correctly tagged or marked so I can avoid it'. But you do care.

LBD is correctly tagged and marked as what it is. It's in the title on the forums, it's tagged on Ao3, it's in every author's note. Whether or not it was correctly tagged has never been up for debate, but you're bringing that in like it was your main point of contention all along. And you *didn't* want to avoid it anyway, or you wouldn't have come in saying the fic has starved you of sustenance and insulted your bullied family simply because it belongs to a niche genre of freely available fan-made fanfiction for this obscure Canadian webserial about superheroes. You are as entitled to the specific genres of fanfiction you read as much as I am entitled to the ones I write in.

This is the mentality *I* don't understand. I don't like a bunch of genres! Gamerfics, dungeonfics, maidfics, SI fics, fixfics, powerwank. I'll check out individual fics from time to time, but mostly I just don't like them. For arbitrary reasons, for legit reasons etc. But I don't go to their rec threads and complain about the fic's genre for existing, hiding behind 'it's just my opinion' as though that somehow makes it not rude and irrelevant to discussion of the material. Your preferences are valid, but your opinions are not always valid, nor do they need to be expressed at every given opportunity."

Tautology cat. Like, my question is, if someone puts a sticker on the cover that says ""aliens inside"", seems like that's good enough for you. I don't understand that at all, so I'm asking questions to determine what's with that.

> Of course there is trash, all fandoms are full of trash. It's Sturgeon's Law, 90% of everything is trash. I just don't understand the desire to get into a world and then strip out everything about that world except for the names of the characters. 

I mean, there's some interesting things to explore here about the power of names, but I see nothing worse about this than about going into a world and stripping out everything about it's characters except their names?

Bad writing is bad, seems like we both agree on that at least. I wouldn't read a shitty coffee shop story any sooner than a shitty alt-power.

Conversely, good writing is good. Someone who threads the needle and manages to capture the characters even without the supporting architecture, and do it well, has done something transformative and neat. Someone who crafts an actual alternative backstory and trigger and set of motivations for Taylor instead of playing sorting-locker roullette has similarly achieved something transformative and neat. I enjoy both of those.

You and I have a different definition of literally then.

Now who's reading into things...

I get into this thread because ""Hey new fic!"" and then I read what it's about and I express my opinion and get jumped all over by a bunch of people because hey, ""Life Bends Down Updates (+ A Spiel On Its Quality)"" mentioned nothing about it being a no powers story. If it had been tagged as no powers I'd have likely done the exact same thing I did on space battles, that is simply not bothered.

It features characters from Worm, changed just enough so that a more normal world can contain them. They retain traumas and predilections toward self destructive behaviors which is definitely in line with Worm. 

If that’s not your cup of tea, a click on and then off isn’t any harm to you. It’s clearly stated, and it isn’t necessary to put it into the title. 

I feel like there’s no risk of Coffee Shop AUs taking off, and even if they did, they would be a small bubble inside the Worm fandom. 

Taylor Powerwank reigns supreme over all. She destroys all comers, etc, etc. Trauma is destroyed, dealt with, resolved. Which isn’t the point of Worm either, when we get down to it. So are those Worm Fanfic? Because they feel more like they’re wearing Worm as a rotting husk, handing out power boosts and brainwashing anyone who opposes them."

1081,2020-05-13 20:40:27,gj1qak,"It’s been about 3 years since I stumbled on Worm and not too much longer after finishing found my way to your show in time to catch the back half of We’ve Got Worm, leading nicely into Ward.

That’s three solid years of parahumans content, all capped off by this finale right here. That’s very fitting because of what a big part of the entire experience you guys have been for me. Scott brought up the similarity of web serials to television, and that was something that was immediately apparent to me when I first found my way to this medium.

I love television. Really, I love any medium you can tell a story in, but the thing that is particular to television that I love is the community experience of the narrative. For pretty much any show, you can find other people who like the story just as much as you do, who are in the exact same place in the story that you are at that moment and who are up for discussing, speculating and otherwise enjoying that story along with you. You can also find detailed discussions and analyses of the story by people who are not just fans of this story but fans of the medium as a whole and who bring a broader perspective to the discussion. And all of this is unfolding as you are consuming the story rather than just once it is finished.

That is the standard for how serialized television is consumed and an experience that is almost impossible to replicate in any other medium. And as much as I love television, and film, and games, and theater... my first love has always been the written word, which might be the medium that it is most singularly difficult to replicate that experience with.

There will be a small handful of book series that are such breakout successes that they foster online fandoms capable of achieving something at least approaching that experience, but the overwhelming majority of books are read by too few people, scattered over too much time, to ever provide anything like what is essentially the baseline experience for even some of the most niche television shows.

Enter the world of parahumans, this sub-reddit and We’ve Got Worm/Ward, which together have managed to perfectly replicate for this story the experience I have always wanted to have while reading every one of my favorite books. I cannot tell you how meaningful that was, and thank you both for the part you played in shaping that experience.

Luckily for me I guess, I started the Dark Tower many years ago, fell off during the course of book 3 and never found the motivation to re-read or otherwise reacquaint myself with the prior two books in order to pick it back up again. I did a similar thing with buying but never starting the third Stormlight book, so those are two projects that I’ve been enjoying, finding very useful and am looking forward to continuing to consume going forward.

As a final point, when you guys were trying to pin down how to describe Victoria’s character at the start of Ward, the very first thing that popped into my mind was Buffy Summers, particularly at a very specific point in the run of the series that I won’t elaborate on because, Scott, you *really* need to make Matt watch that show. It would be fun.

P.S. I am a huge Shyamalan fan. I never fell off that bandwagon. Always loved going to see his movies in the theater with my dad. Just wanted to say, The Happening is one of the greatest love letters to Bad B movies made in the modern era, and prior to listening to that episode, the only other person I knew who shared that opinion was my sister, so thank you for that, as well."
1082,2020-05-14 05:06:17,gj1qak,Thank you for doing this.
1083,2020-05-14 13:12:32,gj1qak,"Congrats, guys.

A picture of a crochet blanket which, on first glance, just looks like some fancy yarnwork. But the longer you look at it, the more you find sigils, runes, and magic circles cleverly woven into the seemingly random ~~geocentric~~ (edit: geometric, wtf) designs, until eventually you realize there is not a single line or curve on the blanket which isn't part of at least one magical symbol."
1092,2020-05-10 14:05:59,gh0iuy,"The bonus content immediately reminded me of the sci-fi webserial Caelum Lex, which featured a lot of bonus content between the chapters. There was a lot of art by the author, as well as extracts from in-universe books, emails, phone transcripts, advertisements for in-universe businesses, etc. It allowed for a bit of extra insight into characters, world-building or plot events outside of the core cast of POVs, as well as making the whole universe come alive just that little bit more.

Perhaps as Wildbow uses Pale to experiment with mixing up his usual formula, we might see the once-or-twice-per-arc deep dives into world-building and side characters replaced with smaller snippets released on a much more frequent basis."

A book of shadows, i'm thinking of the one from charmed where it is both spells and a bestiary.

Let's say the bloody children are gremlins instead of goblins. Maybe there's a guide to being a gremlin herder. A one-pager, laminated, because this kind of practitioner isn't likely to take good care of a book and settle down to read it. Just a clock showing 1am, and a visual of a human giving a gremlin a swirly, and a red circle with a line through it. No gremlins in water after midnight. Or was it feeding after midnight made them crazy and water was a danger at any time? Whatever you get it.

Maybe tea leaves or rolled bones, and the reference shown next to it. How to interpret the mixed signs. 

Maybe just a picture of a big, old-timey key. You've seen Attack on Titan. You know we can't handle having unresolved keys."

1097,2020-05-11 03:52:31,gh0iuy,"I think someone in the chapter thread mentioned the possibility of telling a story through receipts, which I think could make for cool extra material; imagine looking at someone's credit card history, too. We could not only learn a lot about someone, but it would be fun to tell apart mundane or regular-awkward stuff from potential magic fuel. I can envision a neat micro story in my head wherein a person's purchases start off normal and slowly spiral out of control into expensive esoteric crap.

But beyond my ideas, something that I think is quite *likely* we'll end up getting as extra material is \[spoilers for chapter 1.1\] >!the results of the rating classroom app thing, in a cute little interface. And I think that could be a neat introduction to the girl's classmates, too, and set up some teenage drama in elegant, minimalist fashion!<

Great episode, guys! It's good to know that there's still gonna be weekly doofbow content for me to deal better with blank timeslots in my schedule\~\~ The Diebold Family Speculation Segment was great, and a smart way to handle speculation and predictions- but if you could actually include some post-credits discussion/speculation scenes once in a while for your fellow Pact veterans, that would be amazing, because I'm slowly going insane trying to manage spoilers to only-palers and I can't be the only one @\~@"
1098,2020-05-10 19:49:48,gh0iuy,"On the significance of Pale, people who are afraid or going into shock also go pale. I don't think I've seen anyone brought that up.

Spoiler for WoG on the Pactverse. >!On Vampires: 'Bow has said that he created the Pactverse when vampires were everywhere in the media because of Twilight and he was a bit sick of it, so in consequence vampires in the Pactverse are sad and pathetic wretches, the lowest of bottom feeders. They might have been powerful before the seal of Solomon, but with it, they're cut off from their source of power since they can't feed on innocents and their lore is both well known and extensive with more obscure weaknesses. So everyone knows at least some ways to dispatch vampires, but there are so many that vampires can still discover things that screw them over after ""stalking the night"" for decades.!<

>What kind of extra materials do you think would be interesting to see in Pale?

I wonder how much 'Bow will stretch the medium. Of course, we'll see text, and probably other images like the Kennet Brochures that are simple enough for him to make. But will that be as far as he goes?

Because we've already seen him commission header art and banners. He could commission an illustration as extra material. And if he can commission stuff, that opens the door to more. How about photos, retouched to add elements that make them relevant to the story? Or voice acting? He could have an audio log or something like that as an extra. If I go really crazy I can even imagine short videos, looking like extracts recovered from corrupted data.

But of course, there are several possible obstacles to that. Starting with how close 'Bow want to stick with the possibility of traditional publishing because stuff like audio logs and video isn't going to work with a physical book in mind.

He also may want to avoid having someone do acting work for him because supervising it would be one more responsibility, and there's probably a lot of potential headaches that could come from it, including being dependent on someone else to deliver the extra material on time."

1101,2020-05-10 16:55:40,gh0iuy,"For the discussion question, I was thinking maybe a newspaper clipping of an obituary, marked with pen for falsehoods or relevant details in the margins.

Finally, maybe pictures of evidence for the murder, like a bloodied hatchet or a torn pair of gloves."

1104,2020-05-10 19:57:46,gh0iuy,"for the extra material, I guess i'm expecting something like excerpts from magical books similar to some of the gathered pages in Pact but with more illustration, but with the Kennet brochure confirming that this is taking place in 2020, I'd love to see Wildbow do something with in-universe social media posts. we've seen him do stuff like that in Parahumans with the PHO chapters, so maybe this won't be too new of a concept but still."
1105,2020-05-11 02:41:35,gh0iuy,"I'd like to see more modern mediums for conveying magical information. Something like a transcribed record from an audiobook or some kind of practitioner podcast. Maybe these people were oathbound to never write magic texts, so they got together and made something for people to listen to and write down afterwards.


I'm sorta imagining an alex jones style insane ranting program, but it's true. A pair of weirdos from Quebec going off about having to fight demonic goblins and illuminati-style cabals, but for real. Naturally, like all French Canadians, their french redneck energy becomes increasingly deranged as they lose more and more stuff to demon hunting over time.


Or maybe a pair of dabbling englishmen who are 2 years into following and commentating the skill of a renowned author of magic books for people who crave emotional abuse. :p"

Lately, Wildbow's been running PHO threads on sundays. The general idea being that he'll start a reddit thread with some kind of short article or interesting forum post from Earth Bet, and everyone will have to respond in character as some ordinary joe in the setting.

It's not exactly possible to do the exact same thing for the Otherverse, but I definitely think it's a really cool way to increase audience engagement and get people to have a lot more fun with the setting.

Maybe we could see one where we're all ""sending letters"" and talking about the death of Clifford or some other large, significant event in Pale?"

""Well, they all moved in with each other and started a sex cult"".

It's too bad though, because it can really be a great game of political intrigues, punk themes of rebellion against the system/the elder, or even a simple super heroes with fangs, but yeah, some weirdos turn it into orgies. Which don't make a lot of sense btw, since they don't really get pleasure from sex anymore, and the closest thing is ""the kiss"", when one drinks from someone else. 

Sorry that you experienced that, I hope it doesn't scare you away from Vampire, because it can really be a great game when done well."
1186,2020-05-05 19:56:34,ge2f2h,"Squick and ickiness aside (which does bother me), I've never understood people having their vampires fuck. Like, OK , have your mages and your werewolves and your hunters and your changelings and whatever the hell else there is fuck. OK. Fine.

but vampires have no physical desire for sex. they derive no pleasure from it. feeding is the closest they get to experiencing sex, end of story. Having sex for a vampire would just be some task to complete, not something fun or exciting or even pleasurable.

i know this subreddit is full of weird sex roleplay but goddamn at least have it make sense in universe."
1187,2020-05-05 20:18:28,ge2f2h,"Jeezues I'm sorry that's how it went. I love VtM and with this game I see it happen far to often. I had a problem player that wanted to play like this for no reason. He always fixated on our only female player (jasmine). She comes to me one day in tears because she doesn't wanna quit but she dreads playing and doesn't want to cause a problem. I said let me handle it. Next session he was like 
""I'm gonna do (insert odd sec act here) while staring at jasmine.""
Me: ""what are you attempting to accomplish?""
Player: I want to seduce her.
Me: I set difficulty to a 7 because Jasmine does not like him ""alright make your roll""
Player:""roll what roll my character is tory everybody wants him.""
Me:roll or gtfo
Player continusly fails until he frenzies into the street breaks masquerade and gets a blood hunt on him. He immediately rage quits. Next session I spotlight jasmine to make the kill on the blood hunt. The party all agrees she should get something for putting up with him so the prince now owes her a boon"

Lenient? There are NO rules. None! No mechanics, no plot, no anything. If actually having a gods-damn STORY is ""rigid"", gtfo of TTRPGs, and stop trying to say you are playing one.

1192,2020-05-06 02:45:08,ge2f2h,"I might be misremembering because it's been over ten years since I played V:tM, but I recall quite distinctly that Vampires no longer have sexual urges and can't feel pleasure from the act.  It's mentioned because the only comparably pleasurable activity they can partake in is drinking blood.  


You did say that they apparently hadn't read or understood the rules and all but it still stood out as odd to me.  Why even bother with the pretense of using an established ruleset and setting?

V:tM is a pretty cool system and setting, so I hope you don't let this whole thing put you off of it."

I've roleplayed porn a lot in my lifetime, so I'm not judging them on that. But it just sound like roleplay groups I had when I was like, 18 and dumb. 

I'm not surprised though; there's something about erp that is addicting to some people, I guess. They should just not call it a Vampire game, they should just call it a roleplay group, lmao.

I did some vampire the dark ages and had an orgy scene though imo there is a difference between it serving a functional purpose and just erp. Painting a good picture and let them decide how it was but the short of it was a vampire in Rome had been hosting these parties to lure humans in and keep em as cattle.

Nowadays, we have games like Monsterhearts 2, which has all same sexy monster feel with all of the safety tools Vampire should have been packed with—then again, cybersexual harassment was likely never the intended experience of the WoD designers.

To be clear, all of this you've described is harassment (*especially* if they do it on their 14+ server) and you or any of the people who they draw in without getting informed consent could certainly charge them. \^_\^;

Btw, if you (and your bf as well) still have an interest to play in format ""post whenever you want"", I could try to GM something light-hearted and short (Dungeon World fantasy, Apocalypse World, or space opera with FATE may be).

1211,2020-05-06 02:57:38,ge2f2h,"I mean... My worst vampire orgy, we didn't even get to play as vampires by the time most of the players stormed out.

We started as humans (which could be fine under the right circumstances), two players got raped by a cult(?) and one of them got their legs broken with a sledgehammer. Then we got abducted by space aliens and abandoned in a hotel room with no way out because everything was inpenitrable. Even the fire escape. Even the lock on the door couldn't be picked. Our characters died of malnutrition and I ruined the dms toilet because at that time in my life I had substance abuse issues lol"

I am sorry that you have had to experience Vampire in that way, it is honestly a brilliant horror adventure game, sure it has sexual themes (It is a dark unforgiving world) but it has also many other themes that are another kind of dark, by no means is Vampire a lighthearted game, but this amount of sterilization is just... weird and a little wrong. I generally hope you don't quit Vampire, it is a great game! And if you are ever in question of the Lore and can't find it in the Books just look on the WhiteWolf Wiki!"

Granted, some did have sex in them, but it was never in public forums, and it was consensual between players, and unsolicited inappropriate behavior was strictly forbidden.

Actually, no, Wood Rocket at least pretends to have a plot most of the time.

Frankly I have no idea how groups like that survive, I do agree that the rules can't be too strict but you can't go too far in the opposite direction either."

Why they would try to lure in unsuspecting people who just want to play a ttrpg is beyond me. Why they would then try to guilt them into staying when it’s clearly not their cup of tea is also beyond me. 

Oh, and even in BDSM roleplay servers, they *still* have rules posted upfront to keep people safe. This “no rules because they’re restricting and you’re ridiculous for even asking!” nonsense is just asking for consent issues. The DMs in this story are just a bunch of unethical chucklefucks."

1240,2020-05-05 23:50:31,ge2f2h,Have you ever seen vampire pop media? With that shit as a basis it's a given there's gonna be vampire orgy games.
1241,2020-05-06 00:41:18,ge2f2h,"I have seen several vampire orgies both in game, out of game, online, and in real life. 

&#x200B;

It is never like the movies promise you..."
1242,2020-05-06 21:56:58,ge2f2h,"You sweet summer child.

1/3 VTM games are just vampire orgy games."
1243,2020-05-05 19:36:38,ge2f2h,"I do now. 

But yeah, not sure why WoD games turn into bang games, but it would be nice if they just don't drag unwilling people into it. Like, more power to them for hosting what they want, but lying about it and trying to force and guilt people into it is gross."
1244,2020-05-06 07:15:22,ge2f2h,Stealing edraculated. I don’t even feel bad. It’s mine now.
1245,2020-05-06 17:30:06,ge2f2h,"As someone familiar with MUDs and those that ran them.... I guarantee 100% that none of those rooms were truly private and the admins were absolutely being invisible voyeurs.  


As for vampires (and I did find your joke funny), that vast majority of them in WoD don't get any pleasure from sex.  Drinking blood is 100x more pleasurable than any sensation they felt when they were alive."
1246,2020-05-05 22:45:50,ge2f2h,"Lol, I think he just wanted whichever version of her had the least amount of clothing, which was none, but still wanted a BDSM vibe. I don't know if he's actually listened to her music though."
1247,2020-05-06 03:33:05,ge2f2h,I don't even know you and I love you.
1248,2020-05-05 21:43:13,ge2f2h,"Yeah, the larp are even worse, from what I hear at least. I don't want to sound judgy but from what I heard, it's mostly edgy teens who want to create their sex/emo-gothic fantasy. I understand how the game has these kind of themes but come on, it can be so much more !"
1249,2020-05-05 23:16:00,ge2f2h,Oh dear god. **No!**
1250,2020-05-06 04:56:50,ge2f2h,"> Fucking ew.""

I can relate so well on every level."
1251,2020-05-05 18:30:17,ge2f2h,"I'm surprised I made it so long as well, but I didn't really see the true horrors until day 3. Then it was just confusion as to if it was really happening, if someone would step up to stop it, and the morbid curiousity of how disturbing it would become. 

I agree entirely about the lack of rules. I kept being told there *were* rules, but only Abel the server owner had them. It was on the final day, and moments before I left, that he basically stated that rules did not exist and were whatever his mood set for. Then I got the fuck out of dodge."
1252,2020-05-05 19:46:16,ge2f2h,I would lose interest fast if there seemed to be so much... nothingness to the game. Are we just RPing a sex dungeon for the sake of cybersex? Cool — but don’t lie and say it’s not
1253,2020-05-05 21:04:09,ge2f2h,RhyDin was a wild place.
1254,2020-05-05 21:32:03,ge2f2h,"I believe they asked my boyfriend once if he'd make a character, but they did not in any form or capacity berate him at all, no. God that's creepy. I'm learning new things and I'm even more disturbed. I don't like it! I don't like it one bit!"
1255,2020-05-05 21:03:58,ge2f2h,"Sadly it's just my own mess up at a title that stops me from having any kind of alternative of stories. This was the only vampire orgy game I've 'played', and I absolutely refuse to say it was the opposite of the worst game. I REFUSE."
1256,2020-05-05 22:55:24,ge2f2h,"I didn't think you were laughing at me at all! In hindsight, I'm in disbelief and grossed out, but it's comical how bad of an idea their game was, and how poorly they executed it."
1257,2020-05-05 23:11:50,ge2f2h,"Thank you. D': Yes, I was struck with the inability to look away when I saw the first signs of horror. It was shock that someone would even begin to consider lying to trap members into playing, and then it was that none of them could see how fucked up it was. The final straw was the owner claiming that things were entirely as planned. Noped right out of there."
1258,2020-05-05 21:05:10,ge2f2h,There's nothing wrong with people having sex in their games. It's up to the GM and group to agree on what they are comfortable with... this was lied about to get me to join just so it could slap me in the face. I'm safely on the side of the fence that I won't look into vampire games for a long while going forward.
1259,2020-05-05 22:31:26,ge2f2h,"I wholly believe it can be an amazing game! My boyfriend and I were so pumped to read the rulebook and just see options for how awesome it could be, it just wasn't the game we had joined. 

I am, to be honest, a little jaded about vampires right now. The game rulebook isn't to blame, I just hear about vampires and recall that game immediately. It's still too fresh. But one day."
1260,2020-05-05 21:16:38,ge2f2h,"See, they told me and my boyfriend that they knew this in the rules, but that they were choosing to ignore that rule because it's 'not fun' and they 'didn't want to play that way'. So they just removed it entirely and made that the entire plot of the game. Huh, I guess they did have a plot."
1261,2020-05-05 22:14:25,ge2f2h,"To quote Oscar Wilde, ""Everything is about sex - except sex.  Sex is about power.""

In a proper Vampire game, I would expect that some of your resident bloodsuckers would use it as leverage when dealing with mortals, or possibly as a very literal form of domination.  In D&D 5e, Vampires are described as craving the ""things they had in life, but twisted by undeath.  Love turns to hungry obsession, while friendship becomes bitter jealousy.""  In an improper Vampire game, on the other hand, I would expect... well, OP's story.  Lots of fucking for no discernible reason."
1262,2020-05-05 23:03:27,ge2f2h,"WoD Vampires definitely don't make sense for it, but traditionally it's pretty much impossible to disentangle Vampires of Western European lore from sexuality. Due to that and the endless amount of 'sexy vampire' portrayals in media, it's easy to see why this game would be formed.

However, forming a game is one thing, being tone deaf dumbos who try to force sexual roleplay on everyone and don't even establish parameters or rules has no reasoning beyond lazy selfishness."
1263,2020-05-05 21:19:03,ge2f2h,"No reason to be sorry. It ultimately sucks that it happened, but I have very little mental scarring from it so I consider myself one of the lucky ones. I feel immensely sorry for all the new players that joined and had their first experience with TTRPGs was that and only that.

And it's nice that you chased that guy out of dodge. Players in general like that happen far too often."
1264,2020-05-05 21:06:56,ge2f2h,"For a couple of reasons. I was a little distracted at the time to realize how awful it truly was, and the person who invited me was my friend(Gaga) so I didn't want to bail when I was just insanely confused and comfortable. I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt that things wouldn't get worse. I was wrong... so wrong."
1265,2020-05-05 23:44:13,ge2f2h,"That's what I thought too. I was so blown away by that level of logic dodging. ""We are a TTRPG game, except we do exactly nothing that a game does because we think it's awful."" It was the moment I left because it finally snapped me out of my daze of horror. It was too much. Too stupid."
1266,2020-05-05 22:54:31,ge2f2h,Hit the mark. But it was worse than that. It was dudes sexting each other and lying to new members to try to manipulate them into joining.
1267,2020-05-06 05:02:32,ge2f2h,"Hahaha, I didn't even notice how well it worked. At the time I was only ready to flee into the wild to get away."
1268,2020-05-06 05:46:33,ge2f2h,"We had, at one point, brought it up to them that it didn't make sense everything was full of sex and sex dungeoning adventures, and their answer was basically that of ""It's what we want so we threw out of the rule. Do not bring it up again."". So they understood a couple rules, but they really did actively avoid putting in any effort to learning the game."
1269,2020-05-05 23:09:53,ge2f2h,"The largest issue for me also wasn't the sex. People can do what they want so long as it's not hurting anyone, but it's the fact that they'd advertise it and lie. They would purposely hide the fact that it was entirely ERP, and they'd claim they were running a game when it was just RP entirely. I saw so many new members in the span of 5 days that joined as their first game... I can't imagine how many players they singlehandedly turned off from ever trying another game."
1270,2020-05-05 23:40:51,ge2f2h,This is the best single word descriptor.
1271,2020-05-06 05:01:52,ge2f2h,"It won't! But I'll still be traumatized for a bit by it. Seeing vampires reminds me of the game, but luckily memory fades over time. And it helps to read of good stories in the setting!"
1272,2020-05-06 05:17:03,ge2f2h,"I'd say they definitely didn't. When I was making my character they couldn't explain nearly any of the rules or processes on the character sheet, and when a crit came up for the first time no single DM could understand what to do. My boyfriend, having read the whole rulebook to make his character sheet, explained how the process worked. It was such a gong show."
1273,2020-05-06 07:27:31,ge2f2h,"For all we know, they probably had a Belmont copy just for sex dungeoning."
1274,2020-05-06 07:28:55,ge2f2h,"Yup, but how else are they going to lure unsuspecting victims into playing with them?"
1275,2020-05-09 21:41:17,ge2f2h,"I see you too have suffered. God, I'm sorry."
1276,2020-05-09 21:30:20,ge2f2h,That's pretty much exactly what happened and it was just so *weird* and awful.
1277,2020-05-09 21:02:09,ge2f2h,"Thank you, it means a lot that you and others have enjoyed it so much!"
1278,2020-05-05 21:38:22,ge2f2h,"Yeah, I'm not even sure why they were using the rule set while also not using the rule set at all. I think it was only to have some semblance of order to character attacks and skills, so they could seduce and bang each other 'uniquely'. Ugh. I'm just uncomfortable thinking about it. They had every opportunity to just... not. 

And I actually run PBP myself! I enjoy the format, and it's quite nice. I really appreciate your offer, but you don't need to worry. I've been keeping myself pretty busy with the lockdown and it's been about 5 months since this game happened but I needed to finally tell the whole story. It's like a weight lifted off my shoulders, and I'm going to be traumatized from the idea of vampires for a while. 

And I just wanted to say that your English is really good!"
1279,2020-05-06 05:00:27,ge2f2h,"Yup. A discord that I believe is shut down now, but I cannot confirm since I left it months ago."
1280,2020-05-06 05:03:00,ge2f2h,"Lol, I'm glad it's been a worthy cause and horror."
1281,2020-05-06 05:17:53,ge2f2h,"It would have been hilarious to troll them, but I was far too traumatized at the time to even realize it was an option as a member."
1282,2020-05-06 07:21:25,ge2f2h,"No no, that's far too much information for them. They don't want to know age or location. This requires some semblance of understanding time or a map or choosing any kind of setting. They just want to know gender. After that, it's just a one way ticket to the town of Awful."
1283,2020-05-06 07:25:49,ge2f2h,"Dear god that was a trip and a half. Sorry you had the GM put you guys through that, sounds incredibly messed up and really not fun."
1284,2020-05-06 07:27:01,ge2f2h,"I think it's less of a tolerance and more that I was naive and trusted my friend that the game would be what I was told it was. I've otherwise had good discord TTRPG experiences, just not that one. Definitely not that one."
1285,2020-05-06 07:28:16,ge2f2h,"Check out /r/lfg and follow the guidelines, should help you find some players. You can also ask around on /r/rpghorrorstories's own discord, people are always looking for games."
1286,2020-05-09 21:41:44,ge2f2h,"Lol, yeah, my title was a little unfortunate. I don't have a best, just a really, really bad worst."
1287,2020-05-09 21:44:10,ge2f2h,"Fortunately, I believe the group died off and is no more. One could only hope and pray."
1288,2020-05-09 21:40:53,ge2f2h,"He does use reddit and knows my username, lol, but I doubt he'll go looking for horror stories."
1289,2020-05-09 21:39:18,ge2f2h,"Oh I still want to play the codebook at some point, I like the idea of what it is, just not that particular group. They were, um, not to my tastes, I shall say."
1290,2020-05-06 16:06:39,ge2f2h,"Nope, it's even in the setting that vampires can't even get it up. They're just using it as an excuse to try to get people to join."
1291,2020-05-09 21:28:22,ge2f2h,"Once I saw the sexual content I was immediately uninterested, but I was already determined to no longer try to play once I found out I had to beg others to play. That alone was just too much to stomach. The sexual content was just disbelief and horror, and it happened so quickly that I could not compute if they were really doing it. I wanted staff to react to it, for someone to say something. I was also tied by the fact that I had two friends in the group that acted like nothing was wrong and I was trying to find the words to say I was getting the fuck away. I really do wish I'd never joined the game though."
1292,2020-05-09 21:10:33,ge2f2h,I wanted to support my friend and take an interest in the game he loved. I was told that it fit my pretty niche requirements of playing since I can't do voice and so few people do PBP. I also wanted to give the benefit of the doubt that they were just running things slightly different from how I would... I didn't know I stumbled straight into a sinkhole.
1293,2020-05-09 21:08:55,ge2f2h,"Lol, got'em!"
1294,2020-05-09 21:00:24,ge2f2h,"I think I would have had some respect for the server had it just a little bit of rules. Like either predetermined rules from the codebook, or even some chat rules. Something that was solidified and not just whatever the owners felt at the time. Not even knowing about the ERP, I was very offput by knowing anything could change behind the scenes and I'd be the one held accountable for it."
1295,2020-05-13 15:45:54,ge2f2h,F-list?
1296,2020-05-06 05:19:01,ge2f2h,"Oh, I don't think it was accidental by any means. My friend Gaga told me it was a TTRPG and that they were playing with the VtM V5 ruleset. We were bamboozled hard, and if we had only know we'd have never even come close to joining."
1297,2020-05-14 05:36:13,ge2f2h,"It's not mean at all. In the beginning I was told the game wasn't anything off. Having the character sheet  be annoying was meh, because once it's done it's done. Cain being weird, I thought, could just be avoided by never interacting with him again. Then the ERP was visible, and then I was stricken with terror. It was the knowing my friends in the group would abandon me for leaving. Which makes them not friends, but it was still difficult. I knew I didn't want to stick around at that point, but was determined at the very least to find out what the fuck was up with rules or if they had any intention of changing things. It was only 2 days with full knowledge, and in that time it was a dance of avoiding the inevitable and just understanding what was happening at all. Once it was clear all of them were in on the garbage and nothing could be said to my friends, I abandoned ship."
1298,2020-05-06 02:27:17,ge2f2h,"I will say that there is a way to play VtM in a fashion that isn't edgy and raunchy, and instead focuses on intrigue and politics.
But by all that is indecent and unholy, this shit is not that way."
1299,2020-05-05 21:19:26,ge2f2h,"Gosh, I can't even imagine a LARP version of it. Ugh, I need a shower."
1300,2020-05-05 18:14:21,ge2f2h,"Sweet Jesus, I wasn't expecting it to get *worse*."
1301,2020-05-05 18:18:40,ge2f2h,"14+?

_That’s... That’s illegal_"
1302,2020-05-05 19:57:06,ge2f2h,So am I correct in my assumption that this server was just a bunch of dudes using the thin veil of hyper sexualised female vampires to have cyber sex with eachother?
1303,2020-05-05 22:58:56,ge2f2h,14...... I'd say please tell me that's a typo but somehow I doubt it
1304,2020-05-08 08:27:38,ge2f2h,Please tell me that's the number of players and not the AGE of the players...
1305,2020-05-05 19:03:37,ge2f2h,"It's the second vampire game I've ever joined. The first is run by a friend who hasn't even started the game yet, and there are hopefully no orgies, but I cannot disapprove such a thing since it hasn't started yet. So this one is, by reasoning, the worst. Oh god... so much more worse."
1306,2020-05-05 19:45:08,ge2f2h,"Oh totally. I agree completely. I have quite a bit of stuff I'm uncomfortable with in games and I really appreciate it when GMs and players have a frank and transparent discussion about what's okay and what isn't.

Trying to drag people into stuff they're uncomfortable with and worse trying to guilt them into participating is completely unacceptable. 

I think WoD tends to bring in a lot of great people who like the horror, urban fantasy and goth aesthetics, but I find more than other settings you also draw in a lot of the fetish crowd, edgelords and people with really dark power/revenge fantasies. The issue, I think is that all these people just kind of assume everyone else playing must be part of the same group they are and comfortable with the same stuff."
1307,2020-05-06 00:23:04,ge2f2h,"I haven’t had this problem with my in person game I have been DM’ing, BUT. I can see where this would happen - vampires have “sexy powers” ie attracting or controlling and it’s probably irresistible to some players, just the way some play out of control bards that seduce everyone and everything.

The problem I did have? The guy who begged me to run the game who I thought really knew his stuff wanted to play Lasombra (I don’t have that expansion but I said, “ok, just know your character’s abilities really well”), and lo and behold, he missed the prerequisites for Arms of Ahriman and seriously was about to leave my table when I noticed and told him it wouldn’t work. Instead of having him walk, I told him after the session we’ll swap the two stats to what is required and then he can use it.  I was so frustrated that a grown ass man could be such a little bitch over an error that I was willing to help him fix so he could be the badass he wanted his character to be. Smh. We have some murder-thirsty players at my table."
1308,2020-05-06 12:54:31,ge2f2h,"> But yeah, not sure why WoD games turn into bang games 

Vampires don't even get off by sex. They orgasm every time they bite someone.

Except there is some kinky Tcimisce shit involved."
1309,2020-05-06 16:51:33,ge2f2h,"That I all WoD games though.  They are all like that.  Of course, I have only what I've read on this sub to base that off of, but anecdotal evidence never lies!"
1310,2020-05-06 09:12:03,ge2f2h,Glad you're so sanguine about it.
1311,2020-05-06 04:15:36,ge2f2h,"1. The Vampire LARP I'm in isn't like that, but...
2. When my friend and I were considering joining another friend who's deep into ttrpg warned us that Vampire LARP is where things get fucking weird, and I assume there's a solid reason for the stereotype. 

But our local group is a bit older, so maybe that helps? My biggest issue with it, honestly, is that 90% of the plot is player-driven political squabbles and it turns out I don't really enjoy that."
1312,2020-05-06 11:20:44,ge2f2h,Play Sabbat for Plot.
1313,2020-05-06 14:13:53,ge2f2h,Those pervs just wanted the chance to actually be sexting with a female.
1314,2020-05-06 07:47:24,ge2f2h,So... technically it’s also the best?
1315,2020-05-06 15:18:03,ge2f2h,"> I'm safely on the side of the fence that I won't look into vampire games for a long while going forward.

Aww, I'm sorry. I hope you find other RPGs that you like though!"
1316,2020-05-05 22:36:28,ge2f2h,"You could also try the older editions of vtm rather than v5, i suspect the people still playing them would be more experienced players, so probaably fewer weirdos. That’s my guess at least !"
1317,2020-05-06 13:50:52,ge2f2h,"I agree RE: vampires using sex as a tool, or even as some sort of weird obsession. But that will make sense in the context of the story. You're a hot young stud Toreador? Might as well use that to feed. You're a former revenant turned to a Tzimisce? You probably have strange habits that carry over from your mortal (mortal-ish) days.

&#x200B;

weird sex fetish stuff cause you (you as in the player) are deciding to indulge your kinks in game though just doesn't make sense. 

&#x200B;

And yes, I know, ""This doesn't make sense!"" is the most minor of minor gripes with this situation but it's especially annoyed me in Vampire."
1318,2020-05-06 03:27:13,ge2f2h,"Hell, even in WoD there's clear themes of sexiness; everyone with Presence is alluring and seductive. It's just that the official setting tries to make it more nuanced than *just* sex/use it as a metaphor for predation, rather than a means for fantasy orgies."
1319,2020-05-05 23:45:35,ge2f2h,"Yeah, that's the big problem with it. I remember joining ""normal"" roleplay groups, but it ended up just being erp the whole time. 

And man, does it get old quickly. I don't understand how people can enjoy doing just that, but they do what they want, I guess."
1320,2020-05-06 05:55:39,ge2f2h,Seek out some of the old fiction. I recommend the stuff written before the clan novel saga.
1321,2020-05-05 22:36:02,ge2f2h,"Can imagine, how awkward that was, glad you shared the story, and now let go even the remaining impression. Also, it's great to read that you enjoy to run a game, good for you!
I should say, fortunately, I know people, who plays VtM and don't transform a game into theater of weird fetishes, so, I hope that was just a bit of tough luck, and if you ever wanted to play VtM (of course when your trauma would be healed), you would find appropriate game group. Good luck!
And thank you!"
1322,2020-05-06 03:51:26,ge2f2h,"Where can I find a decent pbp server? I'm a female PoC and I am just... i just don't want to deal with the shit, you know? There has to be a better system than ""join random servers and keep going until you stop hearing sexist/racist bullshit."" Pbp sounds like a lot of fun but... yeah."
1323,2020-05-06 23:04:29,ge2f2h,Lol its cool man. Yours was also a trip and a half. It's crazy how some people are. Everyone jokes I don't know if I have actually played vtm because I never played a vampire.
1324,2020-05-06 13:14:16,ge2f2h,Oh I have posted on lfg
1325,2020-05-10 15:11:22,ge2f2h,"That’s fair. I wouldn’t have considered Gaga a friend after he seemed to be using discord as a sex dungeon, but it can be hard to realize a friend is different from who they say they are.

I once got knee deep in an Erotic Fantasy server with a player who kept insisting that it was normal and everyone was doing it. I felt weird about it so I stopped, and later learned that guy was 16 and had been warned not to initiate that kind of roleplay unless they had express consent. I was learning the ropes of the server and it was presented to me as a requireMent for joining.

Sometimes you have to wade in to the lake of crap to realize you’re surrounded by it."
1326,2020-05-10 01:11:26,ge2f2h,"My point exactly/ On the rare occasion that I invite people to my chat I always inform them that it is a 'pronchat' and ask them to read the rules, because its important to clarify that up front and have rules."
1327,2020-05-13 17:14:49,ge2f2h,"It’s basically a site entirely devoted to text based ERP. I think it was initially made for just furries (given its reputation) but over the years it’s grown to the point where the community is real diverse in terms of character types. 

It’s what I suggest a lot of the desperate Redditors both on and NSFW subs go to, since a lot of people try to ask for RP or outright try to force RP with people. Obviously, that transfer transcends Reddit because people like that (as we can see) are everywhere."
1328,2020-05-14 05:41:17,ge2f2h,Haha fair enough! And I definitely don't blame you for  watching the trainwreck unfold
1329,2020-05-05 21:50:30,ge2f2h,Yeah. They have to put it in a huge blocked off room. I’ve heard some rumors that sick shit goes on in there.
1330,2020-05-05 18:25:35,ge2f2h,Turns out that hell has no bottom.
1331,2020-05-05 18:46:50,ge2f2h,"TBF it sounds like Gaga might not be 18. He comes off as being around 14ish. His whole thing comes off like a group of frustrated 14 year old getting together to role play their favorite show (AHS Hotel, likely?)."
1332,2020-05-05 19:00:36,ge2f2h,"I opted to not participate in that group, but from what I've seen of those DMs and how they played, there were most certainly sexual topics that should not exist. But again, that's me assuming things and by no means is right. I really hope they were not hosting that kind of game."
1333,2020-05-05 21:13:00,ge2f2h,"There was, in fact, one other woman on the server. She was dating Abel(I believe) and was the 3rd DM. I don't think I ever saw her participating in the orgies though. She was also the friend that ghosted me when I left. :(

But otherwise, yes. All of the other players were men playing women, each of them having somewhere around 1 male character to 'participate' with the other players' characters. Barf."
1334,2020-05-05 23:27:02,ge2f2h,"If it makes you feel better, I never joined that group so I cannot confirm they were doing any orgies there.(It's more of an unfair assumption of me to claim it was an orgy group) I was just told by the group of liars(who never told me I was joining orgy group in the first place) that they had a 14+ group and a private group, and based on how they played the rules of the game and acted between each other, the 14+ game was either all orgies or was absolutely dead from lack of content because they refused to have a setting, plot, or anything closely related to either."
1335,2020-05-09 20:58:09,ge2f2h,"It was the age cap, only players 14 and above. Yeah, I know..."

 I don't have high hopes."
1337,2020-05-05 22:16:16,ge2f2h,"I'm aware that it's a wholly anecdotal bias I have, but White Wolf games seem to attract more weird folks than the average TTRPG, from what I've observed.  I personally theorize that it stems from the fact that a lot of their settings include a ""veil"" between the mundane and fantastic world, and holds up social misfits (the goth/punk scenes, drug users, sex workers, the mentally unwell, etc.) as examples of possible people operating near that divide, which in turn kind of encourages the thinking that being a social misfit is ""not bad, just different""; a false dichotomy, because you can be both strange and bad simultaneously.  

But that is of course just my theory, based on my own experiences with *some* people who play these games, not to cast aspersions on every person who plays Vampire, Mage, or Hunter."
1338,2020-05-06 00:43:48,ge2f2h,">draw in a lot of the fetish crowd, edgelords and people with really dark power/revenge fantasies. The issue, I think is that all these people just kind of assume everyone else playing must be part of the same group they are and comfortable with the same stuff.

1339,2020-05-06 04:59:55,ge2f2h,"Usually, in-person games are a lot more sane than online with randoms, but not even they are same for That Guy trope players. Sorry you had to deal with that guy, but it's good that it helped show you what was gonna come in the future."

1341,2020-05-07 02:38:36,ge2f2h,"I played in a Vampire LARP one time. No sex, but the whole thing was basically all the veteran players doing stuff and power tripping while newer players had little input or say on anything.

Felt more like a game of ""Human: The Reality"", which seems a bit self defeating.

Like you should at least level balance everyone part way. It's a well known rule for TTRPGs that you don't want massive level variance between players at the same table because some get left behind. You'd think LARPers could figure that out."
1342,2020-05-09 21:10:55,ge2f2h,"It's a possibility, but hard to say. I just consider them altogether disgusting."

1347,2020-05-06 04:25:10,ge2f2h,"I would argue that Presence doesn't have to be seductive. You're allowed to take Presence as a Nosferatu via the Pliable Blood merit and there's no mechanical imperative to use Obfuscate to make yourself sexy (or even bearable to look at) when you use Presence. Presence is all about making people notice you, trust you, or fear you, which I think can be interpreted pretty flexibly."
1348,2020-05-06 00:12:55,ge2f2h,"Yeah, it would just be nice if they didn't try to lie to people that it's something it's not."
1349,2020-05-05 23:15:01,ge2f2h,"It was definitely just an unfortunate run in with a bad game. I'm sure there are a fair amount of wonderful VtM games out there, I've seen several offers today already. It's really nice to know that it's just a fringe group that's messing with things, and that the actual community is very nice and welcoming."
1350,2020-05-06 07:31:11,ge2f2h,"There are definitely good PBP servers out there. You can check posts on /r/lfg and just really ask a lot of questions to the GM before committing to playing. Alternatively, you could look into GMing your own PBP server. 

I run one and I really enjoy it. I would invite you to mine, but I'm not running at this moment/half taking a break. As well as my games are decently niche and in the style of survival horror."
1351,2020-05-10 16:33:07,ge2f2h,"It's been pretty iffy with Gaga as of recently, even beyond just this game. 

I've never particularly held his sex dungeon fetishes against him, because we were in a writing group together and he always made his interests known(and I've just chosen to not join that). The only damning thing was that he didn't tell me the truth when I joined, and then snarked me when I left. 

And yeah, when you're in the moment you don't really have the whole picture and when you do, you realize just how bad it is and get out."
1352,2020-05-10 03:21:48,ge2f2h,"Absolutely. It's good to have communication, but my god did the vampire orgy group absolutely refuse that. I fear finding another place like that."
1353,2020-05-05 22:53:48,ge2f2h,I'll do both of us a favour and immediately wipe the thought from my brain before I even dare guess what they do.

1361,2020-05-05 23:28:35,ge2f2h,I wouldn't be surprised if it was a bunch of 14 year olds having orgies.... that is a combination of words that I never thought I would say...
1362,2020-05-06 09:29:03,ge2f2h,I know gaga is your friend but if he's involved with orgy roleplays for 14 year olds maybe you should reconsider that.
1363,2020-05-05 22:58:43,ge2f2h,"No, I mean, I don't think it's wholly anecdotal if most people have the same experience. I know a lot of people I played WoD with who were and are totally normal well-adjusted people and still play to this day. There's nothing wrong with the game, the world or anything else

But I also had the Storyteller who drugged and gang-banged my character.

And the friend who killed somebody with a hammer IRL.

And the couple 30-something guys who were hooking up with highschoolers.

So at least in my experience also, it does kinda attract a type. I'd still happily play a WoD game with people (Werewolf: The Apocalypse was my jams) but I might more closely vet my players/GM than I would for other RPGs."
1364,2020-05-06 00:13:40,ge2f2h,"Alternative theories:

1. WoD draws a different kind of weirdo than other TTRPGs do, rather than more per capita. Which jives with my own recollections of 90s -to-early-00s WoD, where DnD tended to pull in more MtG-type dorks and WoD tended to pull in more Goth-y dorks. 

2. WoD, with a setting more like the 'real world', has weirdos exhibit their weird in a different fashion than other RPGs. Weird sex dungeons are a lot more in-genre for a vampire game than for a dungeon crawl; the same weirdo is likely the type, if DMing DnD, to have you demon-impregnated"
1365,2020-05-06 00:44:57,ge2f2h,"Oh no, It does attract weirder folk. It is part of the appeal. 

Hell, I would rather play WOD with a weirdo artiste then someone who treats it like another d20 game."
1366,2020-05-07 16:47:41,ge2f2h,"It’s cool. I thereafter established the rule: at my table, if you rage quit, you are only invited back when you’re back in my good graces AND your character is immediately taken captive by big bads and your teammates can save you or tell you to pound sand. :)"
1367,2020-05-07 03:54:33,ge2f2h,"LARP as a whole has a few different factors in play when it comes to balancing characters. In most TTRPGs, obviously the whole party typically starts out together and advances together, and remains more or less a cohesive unit the whole time. But for most LARPs, the staff is running a persistent world where new players join in and old players leave over the course of several years, so that kind of cohesion isn't generally feasible. But the difficulty is that you still want to give players a sense of progression that feels meaningful (as opposed to ""the highest level character is level 16, so all characters get to be level 16 too).

Most (in my opinion) good LARPs handle this by making progression broad rather than tall. Leveling unlocks new abilities and options, rather than inflating your numbers. This helps flatten the gap between newer players and veterans, and makes it more difficult for veterans to run away with the game like that.

But yes, Vampire is kind of infamous for all of those problems and more."
1368,2020-05-05 23:12:57,ge2f2h,"Yeah, I get tha. If you need help for the system later, you suould try the whitewolfrpg subrrddit, qnd the onyx path forums, they are pretty responsive and very nice people :)"
1369,2020-05-06 04:32:18,ge2f2h,"We-ell, I could argue a line there's shades of difference between 'seductive' and 'physically attractive' that sync pretty well with making people notice and/or trust you...

But, in short, no, Presence doesn't *have* to make you seductive... but the setting's pretty clear that that's exactly how it's typically used.

In any case, it's just an example. My main point is the 'sexy vampire' idea is still present in the World of Darkness, existing comfortably alongside the 'vampires don't get anything from sex' idea. They use it to lure in prey, to deceive, and to establish and wield power over others, as befits their awful predatory/parasitic nature. But befitting their monstruous/inhuman nature, *actual sex* is never the goal.

I find that much more interesting than the angle of the vamps from OP's nightmare game."

1377,2020-05-05 18:53:45,ge2f2h,"I pick and choose which seasons I watch. I pretty much ducked out of Circus and Hotel because they seemed hyper focused on the sex rather than the horror. 

But yeah. With all of it on Netflix, I figured younger kids might be watching it, thinking it was just a horror show and instead got soft core porn scenes. What was described above came off as a kid who saw Gaga in Hotel, thought that fun, and decided to tweak it with his friends. Big yikes."

1382,2020-05-06 04:43:57,ge2f2h,"Oh, for sure, I'm just playing devil's advocate. The flip side of my non-sexy Social-based Nos is a dominatrix Ventrue in our local game who runs a bdsm night club. It's basically everything you're describing; the character build has nothing to do with player-on-player sex scenes (it's never even come up). It's all about having a collection of mortals she can influence via sex and/or blackmail."

1387,2020-05-06 05:52:19,ge2f2h,"I've been playing V:tM for over a decade, and we do get more of the edgelords of the RPG community, so we have to be aware when a new person shows up, but when you actually get a good group together, there's nothing else like it. I suggest everyone try it out. Just make sure the people you're playing with aren't like this crew. I've seen my share of guys like that, and we usually have them gone within a couple of sessions. That's what happens when we boot them, though. They just kinda settle at the lowest point in the community and coagulate into a group like this, then people like you or OP come along and think ""I've heard of this. I think I'll give it a shot!"", and walk away with a horror story. The same thing happens with D&D, but you've been exposed to the culture enough to know that isn't the norm. I really wish V:tM had a better rep, because it truly is a magnificent game. The lore is deep, the plots are intriguing, and the rules are dense where they need to be, and sparse where they need to be."

1391,2020-05-06 09:11:13,ge2f2h,"It's not super RPG related... The hammer part, that is. But one of my friends who I frequently played WoD with got caught up in some really nasty stuff.

Basically his friend's girlfriend claimed that someone had raped her and my friend, along with his friend lured the supposed rapist out into the woods with the promise of weed, where they'd dug a grave for him and killed him.

I guess tangentially related to RPGs because we were supposed to be playing D&D the day that it happened. I kept calling him and he wouldn't pick up his phone and his mom didn't know where he was. A little bit chilling to think about.

[Joshua Goldman](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/seattle-teen-sentenced-in-jasmer-slaying/) was his name if you want to fact check it. Really, really nice guy. I, to this day, have a hard time imagining him doing something like that"

1420,2020-08-20 02:04:20,icvhg9,"Man, we already are in the conversation as the best starting WRs, best RBs, and by the end of the year, the TE room has potential."
1421,2020-08-20 14:02:53,icvhg9,stupid question but how do I stream this?
1422,2020-08-20 14:30:24,icvhg9,Anything about Jack Conklin?
1423,2020-08-19 20:37:09,icvhg9,"I haven't really liked what I've seen from Baker the past few days. He hasn't looked good for the most part, and 95 isn't even on the field."
1424,2020-08-19 20:28:45,icvhg9,"Hopefully baker gets his connection back. LOVE seeing Bryant do work, he’s gonna be the man to replace Njoku"
1425,2020-08-19 20:25:40,icvhg9,All I’ve seen so far from these are that Njoku and Baker are the biggest issues to solve right now.
1426,2020-08-20 14:06:10,icvhg9,So how long until we bench baker? I give it 5 weeks.
1427,2020-08-19 20:27:28,icvhg9,It won’t be long into this season before we realize the state or Baker’s play. If he can’t hit the side of a barn or is throwing picks by week 5 I fully expect to see Keenum on the field.
1428,2020-08-19 21:49:57,icvhg9,While this is true Baker seems to be struggling in the most basic sense. We shouldnt make excuses for the guy. He has to improve this year and throw from the pocket.
1429,2020-08-19 21:40:26,icvhg9,CLEVELAND'S ASS
1430,2020-08-20 00:35:42,icvhg9,I second this.  OP is doing the Lord’s work
1431,2020-08-19 20:41:37,icvhg9,Last year Baker looked great in practice and we all saw how that ended. This is the perfect time for him to go through a rut instead of during the season.
1432,2020-08-19 20:25:28,icvhg9,"I’m over Njoku too (he probably know his time time is up too, hence the trade request) but you’ll be seeing him on the field a lot because he’s definitely the best at blocking at TE."
1433,2020-08-19 21:20:30,icvhg9,Not like you'd ever run a 3rd WR... or heaven forbid we can't sign two top 25 WRs to extensions.
1434,2020-08-19 21:08:48,icvhg9,"It's also offensive system 4 in a year with no in-person offseason, too..."
1435,2020-08-19 20:20:57,icvhg9,"Yeah, definitely looks bad that he’s not making the best throws. But again I’m not too concerned, no one on the team looked flustered not even the coaches."
1436,2020-08-20 14:04:09,icvhg9,"Hop on YouTube. They have a live stream set up around 2:15, might be a bit annoying with the amount of ads and the little they show of the players though."
1437,2020-08-20 14:31:58,icvhg9,He got murked by Porter Gustin on one play that would have gotten Baker knocked into the past in a game. But besides that he’s been stellar.
1438,2020-08-19 20:33:34,icvhg9,It’s looking more and more inevitable.
1439,2020-08-19 21:15:34,icvhg9,"I'm pooping at work and might have missed it, but is Bryant catching passes from Baker?"
1440,2020-08-20 03:34:24,icvhg9,"Bryant looks realllyyy good, but he is running with the 2nd team. So hype to see if he can make an impact this year but the learning curve of TE is no joke. He also is pretty slender so the physicality of the position could be an issue until he bulks up a bit"
1441,2020-08-19 20:32:24,icvhg9,"Keenum looked better today, almost all his throws were money, even Njoku couldn’t drop them. I think Baker’s issue is that he thinks too hard about how each receiver likes the ball. Njoku likes to catch up high so he throws too far and too high. Hooper likes to catch in front of him but Baker is putting too much mustard to make sure it gets him the ball fast. Bryant seems like a stretch out and catch outside kinda guy."
1442,2020-08-20 01:25:43,icvhg9,Keenum's real job is to help Baker improve his play. If Baker fails and Keenum needs to step in he failed at his main task.
1443,2020-08-19 23:52:21,icvhg9,"I wouldnt really call him trying to re-learn footwork to be an excuse though. And who knows if he is accurate or not. If the receiver runs the correct route to the correct spot and he misses then yes, but if the receiver runs a lazy route or runs the the wrong spot - as observers we can't know which is the case 90% of the time."
1444,2020-08-19 21:59:23,icvhg9,"Agreed. I mean Keenum looks to be making those easy reads, don’t see why Baker can’t."
1445,2020-08-19 21:36:43,icvhg9,"Based on the personnel we'd expect to see this season, I think we only really have 1.5 WR starters.  Jarvis and OBJ will play a lot, but we're going to be running 2 back, RB/FB, and 2TE sets so much that a WR3 is not a starter in this offense.  

Normal spread scheme I'm with you, but functionally our WR3 is a bench player."
1446,2020-08-19 22:32:04,icvhg9,This. Defense almost always has the upper hand at first until the offense comes together and develops chemistry and understanding of the plays.
1447,2020-08-19 21:54:40,icvhg9,Some from Baker but mostly Keenum.
1448,2020-08-19 21:46:26,icvhg9,Think he’s playing second team with Keenum
1449,2020-08-20 02:04:40,icvhg9,"Baker likes to compete and he’s got a solid vet working next to him who is throwing well and likely doing all he can to help the youngster out. I’m sure they are talking. However, it’s on Baker to throw well in the end. I’m pulling for him because we’ve all seen what he can do. Just needs to dial it back in."
1450,2020-08-19 22:37:04,icvhg9,Keenum is a longtime vet that has been in this system before. Baker is a third year player who hasn't exactly been put in the best o-line situation for his career.
1451,2020-08-19 22:33:14,icvhg9,Keenum has played for Stefanski
1452,2020-08-19 21:44:40,icvhg9,"Good points, I guess my point is when people say starter they don't always mean better than OBJ and Landry but he is a talent that can develop into a starting caliber NFL reciever."
1453,2020-08-15 17:32:33,i9sqno,Holy fuck balls. Dude...
1454,2020-08-14 16:43:29,i9myf1,I think this is an exact quote from the murderers manifesto.   It’s ironic that they will literally quote a mass murderer and then turn around and whine that they are being shunned from society due to “looks”
1455,2020-08-14 19:18:56,i9myf1,"Somebody needs to tell him “supreme gentlemen” don’t threaten people because they aren’t attracted to him. With his degree of narcissism it doesn’t take a whole lot to imagine how toxic a relationship with him would be. 

Typically when one thinks the entire rest of the world has the problem, more than likely it’s a he problem lol"

1458,2020-08-14 13:30:28,i9dxwk,"Fantastic research, but as I read the lists I cannot help feeling like a lot of these names are purely business connections and not a list of a pedophile ring. A few of the people died 20-30 years ago, and surely if this was a list of people 'ordering' girls, it would have been updated at all times.

One must remember that he was filthy rich and actually was a successful investor as well, and several of the people on the list were finance people or people with a lot of money, meaning that the connection can simply be just business. All though I am sure some of them could have been part of the 'network'."

The ones I found are the worst theories I’ve probably ever seen."
1460,2020-08-30 20:49:11,i9dxwk,Do you think that’s why Robert Trump ‘died?’ Because he exposed Epstein as still being alive?
1461,2020-08-14 03:18:14,i9dxwk,"Wait, what? Why’d you leave out Trump, Donald? Epstein had **14** different numbers for him in that book. Are you using a doctored version?

In any case I do really like this content here, keep it up."
1462,2020-08-14 15:51:53,i9dxwk,"I think that you are 100% correct. Many of these people are just bankers, real estate investors, interior designers, etc. who had dealings with Epstein that had no relation to child trafficking. People who claim that all of Epstein's contacts are pedophiles are wrong and they are doing a disservice by sensationalizing a story that doesn't need sensationalizing. There are still a ton of people of tremendous wealth and power in this black book who are implicated and certainly involved."

1465,2020-08-14 04:28:30,i9dxwk,"Genuinely good question, but I promise you nothing sinister is happening here.

After Epstein's A-Z section, he has more phone numbers listed under other categories (i.e. 65th Street, France, Hotels, etc). Donald Trump appears AFTER the A-Z section under the ""Jeffrey (J)"" section of his black book. I am not sure why Epstein separated Donald from the rest of the family, but he did. Trust me, I have no political agenda here. I'm just going in order from the link in the OP.

Thanks for the kind words at the end! I appreciate it."
1466,2020-08-14 16:03:20,i9dxwk,Absolutely.
1467,2020-08-28 21:33:09,i9dxwk,"All of these are bonkers crazy.  I believe there are pedophile rings out there but they are shady men & women of Epstein & Maxwell's ilk. They don't hide for long & people expose them. Epstein was exposed. We know Prince Andrew is lying but the rest of the royal family isn't in on some pedophile ring. That's crazy talk. The reality of these powerful men getting away with this shit for years after lots of public allegations is shocking enough. You cheapen it by spreading crazy, unfounded conspiracy theories that don't have an ounce of solid proof to back them up."

1473,2020-08-14 08:28:30,i9dxwk,"Nope, but after reading that article you posted, I am very interested in learning more. I haven't found any links between him and Epstein or Ghislaine and none of his names (Aviv Nevo, Avi Nevo, Vivi Nevo, or anyone with the name Nevo) are listed"
1474,2020-08-14 08:25:41,i9dxwk,Thank you!
1475,2020-08-29 13:40:26,i9dxwk,"No. You're original post detailing the little black book entry is interesting & well done. It's the links about the ""black nobility"" that you've posted that talk about the multiple families all in on a plan to enslave the world & full of pedophiles. It's just really crazy. These royal families have zero power & only keep their incomes going because they are tourist attractions. Hardly the evil the sites spout. Like I said, the truth is already insane enough - Prince Andrew is obviously a scumbag that needs to face some kind of punishment along with Maxwell - why cheapen the real crimes by bringing in this worldwide conspiracy that doesn't exist?"
1476,2020-08-29 14:02:17,i9dxwk,"As for Jimmy Saville, he was a sick individual that should've been exposed when he was preying on children. Many of these predators that used their fame & fortune as shields - Epstein, Maxwell, Harvey Weinstein, Bill Cosby, etc - have been exposed. Just like the pedophile priests have before them. Ppl everywhere are being exposed & caught. There are way more that need to be exposed & caught but these large families aren't all in on child molestation. That part is the crazy part. 

I have a cousin that recently got sent to jail for having child pornography. It was shocking & sickening to learn about. His parents were ashamed so they kept it a secret from the rest of the family saying he had PTSD from his time in Afghanistan & couldn't go to family functions (but he was in fucking jail!) It wasn't until he was sentenced & it made the news that they finally came clean with everyone. Because I have a family member who's a sick pedophile, does that make my family part of this worldwide conspiracy? No.

I'm someone who's been the victim of sexual assault & I'm also a foster mom. I'm doing all I can to help other children who've suffered from the same abuse or worse so when i found out about my cousin, I was enraged & disgusted. This guy who I grew up with was actually this sick demented person. I'm so glad he's in jail & will be a registered sex offender. All ppl who victimize children should be found & locked up. But we need to go after the real perpetrators not muddy up the truth & the real problems with out there conspiracies. That's all I'm saying. 

Is the royal family a bunch of entitled assholes? Yes. Most rich ppl are. (Look at Trump, Bezos, etc) But these ppl arent all working together to take over the world & enslave us. The truth of encroaching authoritarianism in America is bad enough. We don't need conspiracies to cheapen the truth is all I'm saying."

1538,2020-07-25 07:35:27,hxfgqd,"Removed, almost no goth in there."
1539,2020-07-25 05:58:08,hxfgqd,Zombie by Cranberries is not even Halloween themed. And obviously not goth. I suggest you look up the actual meaning of the song. And neither is Ghost Town by The Specials though it does have an eerie sound
1540,2020-07-25 02:59:43,hxfgqd,But what does it have to do with goth? Maybe this would be more appropriate for r/Halloween?
1541,2020-07-25 06:21:04,hxfgqd,"This is a massive list of a ton of not goth stuff, and also it's kind of bizzare this isn't a YouTube playlist? 
I don't get it."
1542,2020-07-25 06:22:33,hxfgqd,"Yyyyeaah, it should not be jammed into this playlist and squished between a Micheal Jackson song and the campy Adams Family theme song."
1543,2020-07-25 05:00:13,hxfgqd,I see some goth bands in this.
1544,2020-07-25 05:01:04,hxfgqd,What goth bands? They only listed two
1545,2020-07-25 05:04:38,hxfgqd,Sioxuie and the banshees and the cure and some that are appreciated in the gothic subculture.
1546,2020-07-25 05:05:27,hxfgqd,"Which is only two in that list, the majority of this list is not goth."
1547,2020-07-25 05:07:26,hxfgqd,Yes but there are artists that are appreciated in the gothic subculture.
1548,2020-07-25 05:08:28,hxfgqd,That doesn't mean it's appropriate for this subreddit.
1549,2020-07-25 05:09:50,hxfgqd,Well it's still here so...
1550,2020-07-25 05:10:42,hxfgqd,Yeah and don't be surprised when our only active mod on here removes this post.
1551,2020-07-25 05:13:25,hxfgqd,The rules say nothing about things like this.
1552,2020-07-25 05:14:04,hxfgqd,It's tied to the relevancy rule.
1553,2020-07-25 05:15:02,hxfgqd,"Also your new to the sub, if you ever see posts about recommendations or posting playlists, Dave always mentions to keep it goth."
1554,2020-07-25 07:32:20,hxfgqd,"The rules do say something about relevancy. Since this s a goth sub, centered around goth music, posts have to be relevant to goth music. I have nothing against adding some goth-adjacent/non-goth songs in a playlist, but if it's posted here, at least the half should be goth songs

Edit: how could you forget to put 'Halloween' by SatB on a Halloween playlist, but had 'Spellbound' ?"
1555,2020-07-25 05:16:52,hxfgqd,No it's not. This person is sharing a Halloween playlist and there are goth band on it along with artists appreciated by the gothic subculture.
1556,2020-07-25 05:17:21,hxfgqd,Halloween isn't goth.
1557,2020-07-25 05:19:05,hxfgqd,Well it's relevant enough in the subculture.
1558,2020-07-25 05:20:50,hxfgqd,"Nope, here's the thing, there's a difference between goths happening to like stuff, versus things that are actually goth, (mostly the music). A lot of goths like vampires, that doesn't mean you post vampire stuff unless it's related to actual goth music."
1559,2020-07-25 05:21:57,hxfgqd,There is goth music in this persons playlist.
1560,2020-07-25 05:23:10,hxfgqd,"Yeah, only two though, if isn't majority goth, it's not appropriate for this sub."
1561,2020-07-25 05:24:45,hxfgqd,Yeah but there are a some songs in there that are appreciated by the subculture.
1562,2020-07-25 05:26:21,hxfgqd,"We stick to goth music here though, everyone is aware of the other non goth genre subreddits out there that get are appreciated by the subculture."
1563,2020-07-25 05:29:14,hxfgqd,"All I'm gonna say now is you're not the owner of the sub or a mods operator. 
Although if this gets taken down I'll admit my defeat."

1565,2020-07-25 00:40:21,hxdh22,">That was written by an obvious normie with a primative entry level understanding and knowledge of true emo.""'Real Emo' only consists of the dc Emotional Hardcore scene and the late 90's Screamo scene."" Absolutely fucking wrong.1. If the implicating is that Emo is exclusive to the DC scene that was happening in the 80's, and that emo is EXCLUSIVE to that region on earth, then no. Emo may have had its inception there but anyone who truly knows emo knows that the genre quickly spread EVERYWHERE, even outside of the US to other continents. The second implication is that real emo is exclusive to the sound that bands were playing in those early days (e.g Rites of Spring, Embrace, Moss Icon etc etc) and no, absolutely fucking wrong.

&nbsp;

>Emo was a genre that once planted its seed quickly grew and evolved. Which is why the band ""After words"" sound different from rites of spring, which is why the band Chino Horde sound different from After Words, which is why Indian Summer sound VERY different from rites of spring etc etc etc. TRUE emo has different sounds from the mid 80's sound to the 90's distinctive sound that you hear from bands like Cedar of Lebanon and Don Martin 3. People will try to argue that emo has evolved to inlcude bands like the get up kids and american football and to that I say ""Yes it has, but it does not include those fake emo bands. Bottom line is that Emo is far from being exclusive to DC in the 80s.2.

&nbsp;

>""The late 90's screamo scene?"" what the fuck is this? this is how you know that the person who runs ""memelords against furries and fake emo"" is a complete entry level normie. The page does nothing but Dickride bands like Orchid, Pg 99, loma Prieta, Suis la lune, city of caterpillar etc etc. While they are good bands, these guys are VERY late in the game. Orchid and Pg 99 literally play an evolution of screamo (screamo being an evolution of emo) that's more screamoviolence than pure screamo (again, because they were very late in the game). Loma Prieta are even LATER in the game and the shit they play has twinkle riffs everywhere (twinkle riffs are the bane of emo and are a clear signal of fake emo) Loma prieta do play screamo, but a very far evolved version of it.

&nbsp;

>And suis la lune get the fuck out of my face, their music is so goddamn post rock influenced (albeit really good) that to note them as examples of pure EMO is asinine. The point is that the copy pasta wants to imply that Emo only consists of that 80s DC shit and the ""Late 90's screamo scene"" which is beyond fucking inaccurate because as we established, all those ""screamo"" bands that we mentioned are fucking late as hell in the game. Screamo started in the early 90's and was extremely prevalent in the French Hardcore scene, and when you actually listen to those bands (Jasemine, Anomie, Fingerprint, Ivich etc etc) you see that their TRUE screamo sound sounds MUCH different from Pg 99.

&nbsp;

>THESE are the true screamo bands they are the TRUE EMO. Whoever wrote the copypasta literally knows hardly anything about screamo and is under the impression that ""screamo"" started late in the 90s and that is so fucking goddamn off. Bands like Orchid, Pg 99, Tristan tzarsa, iwrotehikus are to Screamo what I Hate Myself are to Emo. And Speaking of I hate myself, most of their music is Fake emo. THe only real emo song I've heard from them is the first track on ""Four Songs"". Bottom line is that all those screamo bands technically are screamo, but they are NOT what ""true emo"" or the ""true screamo scene"" is exclusive to.

&nbsp;

>Far from it.So everything else this copy pasta goes at stems from this dude literally thinking that bands like Pg 99 are the true emo sound, which they aren't. Like how they say that real emo is HATEFUL. The distinction between Orchid and a pure emo band like Breakwater is so obvious that any normie could notice it. Characteristics of emo Yes they do include Hatefulness sometimes but True emo Sounds passionate, beautiful, melodic, Raw, Fast or slow, just pure and intense but still rather subtle and elegant as pretentious as that might sound. (like I said, emo has lots of different sounds and has many different feels)But yes, it's true, that whole ""post emo"" movement, the ""midwest emo"" shit, the ""twinkle mathy"" shit, and fucking the ""emo revival"" ALL OF THAT IS FAKE SHIT.

&nbsp;

>ALL OF IT. I personally love bands like Mineral, SDRE, Get up Kids, Elliot etc etc but they aren't true emo. They have a slight influence but they don't like post harcore, they play stuff that sounds extremely light and poppy. But I'm going to say this now FUCK midwest, FUCK twinkle, FUCK ""emo revival"" which is the cringiest shit I've ever heard. These same people will try t say that calling bands like alesana and MCR 'emo' is fallacious yet they believe in the ""EMo revival"" which is the fakest emo you will ebver fucking get.

&nbsp;

>Bands like American football are literally akin to fucking dashboard confessional. The fact that people will call American football an emo band is so fucking beyond even having the slightest bit of intelligence. Anyone who knows what emo is knows that it's a HARDCORE GENRE. Bands like MCR and ALESANA and THE USED (at least when they were starting) sounded an INFINITELY MANY times more True Emo than American football EVER WILL. The fact that american football get any fucking correlation to emo leaves me speechless. The fact that in any possible way AMERIcan Football can lumped in with the term ""emo"" let alone ""REAL emo"" is just, i have no fucking words.I've been on Fake Emo Patrol since 2014, and everytime I come across a get up kids or promise ring or american football video I always see way too many comemnts about emo, and I'm always happy to call y'all normies out and patroll fake emo.

&nbsp;

>But ever since this shitty copypasta came out, now normies think they're on emo patrol and that they know what they're talking about. So now I have to deal with Posers who say that American Football are emo, AND I have to deal with posers who say that ""ReAl EmO OnLY CoNsIsTs of TheE DC sCeNeE and the LaTE 90s ScReAmo ScEnE"" fuck off. Shit makes me not even want to patrol anymore because all I ever see anywhere are normies who don't know what they're taling about.

&nbsp;

>TRUE EMOS KNOW. We are the ascended ones. Whe watch you from above. We Stay rooted in the late 80s and the 90s, ascending gracefully to Emo eden through the sounds of true EMO bands. WE ARE THE ENLIGHTENED ONES, WE KNOW THE BEAUTY OF LIFE. I will continue to be chief of emo patrol, but this might be my last official statement or patrolling action. It's become something beyond me to bother with. there's no need to hope for humans to understand true emo, there's no hope in educating ""memelords against furries and fake emo"" Perhaps one day you will ascend (I personally was once like you, believing that emo meant SDRE, AF, orchid, Funeral diner, Lovelost but not forgotten) but for now, I won't bother anymoreShare the fuck out of thisLet my words be heard LONG LIVE TRUE SCREAMO

If you are looking for the monetary cost of building Taj Mahal, it was 41.8 million (4.18 crore) rupees in 1631. But what was the value of 41.8 million in those days? The average income of a single family of peasants was approximately equal to One Dam per day. A Dam was a copper coin and 40 Dams was equal to a single rupee(1). A single rupee fetched 280 kilograms of rice. Taj Mahal was constructed at a cost of 4 crore rupees(2).

But Taj Mahal demanded not just money. It demanded blood. The blood of 7.4 million people.

A little background. It was 1631. Shah Jahan with his army marched to Burhanpur (Malwa) to punish a Mughal commander who turned rogue and joined hands with Shia Adilshahis ( Bijapur) and Nizamshahis against Shah Jahan . Mughals used to extract approximately 7.7 million (77 Lakh) as annual revenue from the province of Malwa in 17th century(3). The fertile land of Malwa was a milch cow for Mughals. The rebellion threatened this income and Mughals descended into Malwa and Deccan to crush them. In fact, Mughals began invading and ravaging Malwa years before Shahjahan himself came to Burhanpur. As early as 1629, Mughal commander Khwaja Abu Hasan invaded and ravaged Malwa. These actions led to the genesis of Great Famine of 1630-1632(4).

What the imperial Mughal army did in Malwa and Deccan was described by both contemporary Mughal chronicles and foreign travelers. Shahjahan ordered the Mughal army to ""ravage the country from end to end"" (5). They carried out this order so comprehensively that Shahjahan-Nama says after the campaign, ""there is scarcely a vestige of cultivation left in this country""(6). Shahjahan used to follow the insecure Mughal tradition of not leaving their wives alone even during war campaigns. He took Mumtaz Mahal along with him to Burhanpur. It was here that she died giving birth to Shah Jahan's 14th child after a 30 hour prolonged labor! To house her corpse, Shah Jahan decided to build Taj Mahal.

Meanwhile, the devastating campaigns of Shah Jahan had borne the result. There was a scarcity of rain that year and the devastating Mughal campaign resulted in a total famine. This famine of 1631 was one of the deadliest in world history. It afflicted the Gujarat, Malwa and Deccan regions as it was precisely here that Mughals ran their devastating campaign.

The condition of affected people in the famine was described by Mughal court historian in the following words

""Inhabitants were reduced to the direst extremity. Life was offered for a loaf, but none would buy.. Dog’s flesh was sold for goat flesh.The pounded bones of dead were mixed in flour and sold. Men began to devour each other and the flesh of a son was preferred to his love. The numbers of the dying caused obstructions in the roads..Those lands which had been famous for fertility and plenty of resources retain no traces of production""(7)

Some excepts from the diary of Peter Mundy, who traveled across this region during that time

""Surat(Gujarat)-- Great famine, highways unpassable, infested by thieves looking not for gold but grain; Kirka- Town empty. Half inhabitants fled. Other half dead; Dhaita- *Children sold for 6 dams or given for free to any who could take them so they might be kept alive; Nandurbar(Maharashtra)-No space to pitch a tent, dead bodies everywhere. Noisome smell from a neighboring pit where 40 dead bodies were thrown. Survivors searching for grains in excrement of men and animals. * Highway stowed with dead bodies from Surat to Burhanpur""

About the Mughal overlords, Peter Mundy says -""In Bazar lay people dead and others breathing their last with the food almost near their mouths, yet dying for want of it, they not having wherewith to buy, nor the others so much pity to spare them any without money. There being no course taken in this Country to remedy this great evil , the rich and strong engrossing and taking perforce all to themselves""(8)

But where was all the food ? While the entire province lay dead, Shah Jahan's war camp was ""fair and spacious, plentifully stored with all provisions, being supplied with all things from all parts, far and near""(9)

While people in the entire province were dying due to famine caused by his own army, Shahjahan was busy collecting money for his Taj Mahal. Taxes in Mughal empire were among the highest in the world. According to the estimates of JNU scholar Shireen Moosvi, Mughals took 56.7% of total produce of peasants(10). Contrast this with Hindu kings who mostly took only one-sixth (16.6%) as laid out in the Hindu scriptures.

And how did Shah Jahan use this revenue? 36.5 % of the entire revenue was assigned to sixty eight princes and Amirs, further 25% to the 587 officers.Thus, 62% of the total revenue of the empire was appropriated by just 665 Mughal elites as their personal property (11).

So, Shah Jahan brought famine upon the country by invading and completely ravaging Malwa and Deccan to reassert his authority. Where the state's revenue needed to be used to quell the famine, he instead intensified it by diverting the funds to build Taj Mahal.

According to contemporary sources like the letter written by Dutch East India Company (VOC) lawyer, the famine led to 7.4 million deaths (12). This was a man made famine. And one man whose lust for power and wealth knew no bounds was responsible for it.

The Bengal famine of 1943 took away 2.1 to 3 million lives. If Winston Churchill should be held responsible for this ""genocide"", then Shah Jahan should also be held responsible for the genocide of 7.4 million . And that was the cost of building Taj Mahal.

Relevant Bella+Canvas model numbers:

* 3001 for crew neck
* 3005 for v neck
* 3014 for modern/raw crew neck (My personal fave, hope they make LS versions)
* 3406 for wide neck (Haven't personally bought this. If any of ya'll have it, lemme know your opinion of it, b/c once I get fit again, I'm gonna cop some.)"

1648,2020-07-20 06:09:57,huecf1,"I think $50 is my personal max but essentially the fabric feels way better, the t-shirts last longer and you are supporting better business practices i.e. better pay for workers, supporting local businesses, etc... Everyone has their price but I would 100% recommend going towards the $20-25 range as you can get way better t-shirts that many top brands use."
1649,2020-07-20 06:58:38,huecf1,"Cloth, cut, construction and ethics. I have never bought $80 t-shirts at retail, only when they are on sale (admittedly infrequently because they tend to be sold at independent, small boutiques that don't have the margin to run sales all the time) for $25-40. That's not much more than the ~$20 you can expect to pay for a mainstream Nike/Champion/Adidas tee from China/Indonesia/Vietnam/Cambodia/Bangladesh.

For instance, I have numerous generic tees and the armpits tend to form holes due to wear and tear within a year or so. One of the more popular high-end tee brands - Merz B. Schwanen - is known for sewing a [relatively intricate triangular reinforced patch](https://www.rivetandhide.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/thumbnail/1124x1500/6701f3ed6bb1a7acacb18375e609804a/d/s/dsc_5708_2.jpg) at the armpits that allows a slim sleeve cut while distributing the strain to avoid the issue. Merz also uses [loopwheeling](https://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/hrqogw/stance_loopwheel_pocket_t_made_in_japan_heather/fy5tv14?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x), a very slow artisanal way of weaving cloth that may have some advantages, but low yield means its only used for $60-$100+ retail tees (unless you can find them on sale ;). It's also made ethically in Germany from certified organic cotton, and the stitching is sturdy and neat. Plus there are no side seams, reducing a potential point of failure. Their shirts tend to be very slim, sturdy, with chunky, fluffy cloth that is very supple and breathable for the weight because of the knitting process.

One of the other more popular high-end brands mentioned by OP, Sunspel takes a different tack - thinner, springier cloth, but somehow not flimsy. Also made in England/Portugal. Has a nice cut because its athletic, but not extremely slim, giving a very flattering look. I can't fathom paying full retail for both, but I can see why someone who had the disposable income and eye for detail would. Either way, I think they are solid deals on sale."
1650,2020-07-20 13:29:36,huecf1,">	I’m struggling to justify most of the shirts on this list.

You don’t have to. If that’s what you want to spend, that’s fine. Others may value tees differently, have different budgets, or consider other factors."
1651,2020-07-20 15:38:55,huecf1,"I have several merino wool t-shirts. They run $50-80, but they are amazing. They are light and breathable without being transparent, the fabric feels amazing and they tend not to smell until I've worn them 3-4 times, which makes them great for travelling. I could totally see that not being worth $50-80 for a lot of people, but I personally love them. For a plain cotton T, I'm definitely on your team."
1652,2020-07-20 15:59:42,huecf1,"Personally, I limit myself at 25$ and recently got a fabletics t-shirt. It's so soft and smooth, the fit is top quality too.."
1653,2020-07-20 07:33:30,huecf1,"Don\`t let anybody fool you. A $80 t-shirt is just goooood marketing. People will buy it because they feel like its a luxury item. A t shirt should not cost more than $40, however some brands can charge $80 because they make profits $$$$. Anybody who says otherwise can stfu with your fake consumerism."
1654,2020-07-20 04:59:10,huecf1,UNI/FORM LA seems like a cheaper version of John Elliot and Jason Scott seems like a more expensive version of Bombas. I'll add them both though!

My personal recommendation is to start with the cheaper/wholesale brands. House of blanks imo produces really well made products that brands take and resell for $60+."

Legit and fake items get sent to Amazon and their they get thrown into the same container. So when the customer orders the item, Amazon couldn't even tell which is fake if they wanted to.

1666,2020-07-20 20:58:55,huecf1,House of blanks has a long sleeve. I would recommend looking at the size charts and comparing the sleeve length to your favorite t-shirt.
1667,2020-07-20 20:57:50,huecf1,Look at size dimensions. You would look for something that has a shorter length but a larger chest size. Also you can look for more contemporary fits i.e. boxy t-shirts. Some of the brands above had boxy t-shirts in their line up.
1668,2020-07-20 07:24:57,huecf1,"a legitimate question that lurkers will downvote

i would also love to know some black owned brands focusing on locally produced, high quality basics. it seems like a lot of t-shirt companies are white or asian owned for some reason or another 

i don’t know many black owned brands that strictly do basic t-shirts, but these brands generally offer some nice t-shirts (usually graphic) in their rotations:

[all cap studio](https://www.allcapstudio.com/)

[public school](https://www.publicschoolnyc.com/collections/mens-tops)

[union LA](https://store.unionlosangeles.com/collections/t-shirts), boutique retailer but also has house basics

1673,2020-07-20 12:00:41,huecf1,Unfortunately they make good products otherwise the CEO is a piece of shit and really brings a bad taste to the mouth. I recommend to people to actually research the brand to see if it aligns with their standards before purchasing.
1674,2020-07-20 21:00:35,huecf1,"Spent almost all week looking for different brands and some of the smaller ones out there. Unfortunately everyone always talks about the big boys i.e. Uniqlo/Bella+Canvas/etc... so I thought it would be good for people to branch out and see that with $10-15 extra, you can get amazing t-shirts that will last you twice as long."
1675,2020-07-20 21:07:11,huecf1,"Hmmmmm, I think your best bet is to take your favorite t-shirt and take the dimensions of it. Compare the dimensions to the brands above and feel free to email them to ask what the width of their t-shirt sleeve is (if they didn't give it). That way, you can find a t-shirt that fits you perfectly. Also you can go with son of a tailor if you want a custom fit t-shirt that fits your own dimensions."
1676,2020-07-20 04:42:39,huecf1,"Wanted to keep it more on the cotton side of things, the only ones that aren't are John Elliot and Lululemon but those are blends from popular brands. Probably shouldn't have put those in but I think people might be interested in them. Also I capped the t-shirts at $100, I think above that point you are getting into very specific products that many people aren't interested in."
1677,2020-07-20 21:04:37,huecf1,"Quality is subjective. It really comes down to personal preference and what you are looking for specifically. Some people might say a $5 bella + canvas t-shirt is high quality while some people feel like the PAA $95 t-shirt the best quality. 

Take a look at the brands in the list, see the weights and their size dimensions. Maybe even email the brand to ask some more questions to see if they are the right match. I think anything above the $15 or so range is going to have t-shirts that have good quality and won't really disappoint. Above $55-60 is where you get into the high fashion point where it's really for t-shirt enthusiasts."

1691,2020-07-20 08:31:54,huecf1,Dang I really missed out if they were at that price. Ima have to keep my eyes on them to see if they drop in price again because 45 for a basic tee is kind of too expensive for me
1692,2020-07-21 21:58:24,huecf1,"Got the pink one for around $8 recently. The cut is relaxed, which I like, but it's slightly weird in a way that I haven't been able to pinpoint yet. Also, the neck opening is pretty large. Still really like it, though."
1693,2020-07-20 15:36:31,huecf1,That’s a great idea! I usually wear button up collared shirts for that reason. (Don’t know why I’ve never thought of a chest pocket t shirt). Are chest pocket polos fashionable?

1695,2020-07-20 18:45:25,huecf1,Do you recommend any specific ones? I’ve always stayed away from that style because I’ve always thought i looked weird in them but have not actually tried them on. I’m weird and was really close minded

1701,2020-07-23 22:42:15,huecf1,"Where do you usually look for sales, if you don't mind sharing?"
1702,2020-07-20 10:47:15,huecf1,"Let's put your statement to the the test.

A typical tee shirt made in the U.S. costs around $7.50 just to make in an ethical factory.

Then you have (depending on the quantity ) your dye charges $1.75 to $3.50 per garment.

Then you have neck tags and care labels .10 to .50

You also have finishing .10 to $3.50 that's for folding, pressing , and bagging. If you use a poly bag it's cheaper. If you use a cotton bag is more expensive.

You need to still pay for shipping. Again, based on volume you could pay .10 to 5.00 per garment depending on shipping method and quantity.

Your fabric costs could be .90 for some cheap ass shit to $48.00 per garment.

The low is now $10.45 and your high is $68.00 and that's the brands costs so far.

You still have to factor in payroll, rent, and advertising. This varies from company to company.

You also might factor in design and exclusivity. Examples might be Rick Owens and Gucci.

A traditional business model is this-

total cost multiplied by 2 to 2.7

wholesale price is the multiplied by 2 ( keystone) or up to 3 times depending on the brand = the final retail price.

These breakdowns will be at keystone. 

 Our low end is  $10.45 x 2 = 20.90 x 2 = $41.80

Our high end is  $48.00 x 2= 96 x 2= $192.00

&#x200B;

\* These prices are for a smaller company with fair volume. Prices don't change much until volume gets much much higher. An example would be 3sixteen or Left field. Whereas a company like House of blanks is the fabric supplier and sewing facility. \*\* Just because a factory makes multiple brands doesn't mean quality or pricing is the same. Another example is 3sixteen. They use a factory in California that makes jeans for other brands but 3sixteen has a much higher expectation of what quality is so their jeans are sewn using better steps and techniques.

These are the facts and not some bullshit marketing."

1723,2020-07-20 08:46:16,huecf1,"I have a lot of Reigning Champ tshirts ($60 - $85 CAD).

Aside from a good fit, they have lasted me FOREVER. Zero deformation, zero shrinkage, etc.

Most of all, I would just rather buy something made in Canada. I've owned <$10 tshirts before, but every time I buy clothes that are *that* low price I feel guilt at the understanding of the mechanics behind producing clothes so cheaply.

I also realize that I'm privileged for being in a financial position that allows me to make the choice to spend 5x the price."
1724,2020-07-20 11:09:23,huecf1,"Honestly, it's because the list is more holistic of what is out there. I did list in the top of the post and in some of my comments that better business practice comes with a higher price. $15-20 is a realistic price for a t-shirt and only goes from there."
1725,2020-07-24 02:33:50,huecf1,"END, Mr Porter, Cultizm (which has Merz on sale for 30-60% off right now). In the UK I have bought from Kafka Mercantile, The Bureau Belfast and Son of a Stag. 

For my Sunspel stuff I bought it from a stock/sample sale organised by the company itself in London earlier this year. The company is currently running a summer sale on their website as well. Careful to look at country of production. Their solid T-shirts are generally made in England, but outerwear, patterns and polos may be made in Portugal/Turkey. They have a fantastic mesh polo (Riviera) made in Portugal.

As I want to try more Japanese stuff (I currently only have Merz from Germany and Sunspel from England), I'm also looking at sales on sites that sell Japanese T-shirts - Self Edge, Okayama Denim, Iron Heart, Corlection, Rivet and Hide."
1726,2020-07-20 12:27:56,huecf1,"I agree with your point but just because something costs more doesn't necessarily mean it is of higher quality. A lot of it is in fact marketing. 

So unless you know how much it cost to make a single item, there's really no way to justify paying so much. That's really the point the other guy is making.

You also said it yourself. Without volume, things cost more. So a smaller company will charge more for an item if similar quality. Then it comes down to supporting smaller businesses and that really doesn't have that much to do with simply buying a t-shirt based on price. Again, it has to be some kind of marketing.

Edit: with regard to the downvotes, what don't you agree with in what I said?"

1737,2020-07-20 12:40:14,huecf1,"For what it's worth, I think it would be better to be more tentative when including any brands that doesn't specifically declare the working condition of their manufacturing facilities. Slave labors can be anywhere in the world, not just in China, just so happens that the Uighur labor situation is being brought to the spotlight. I work in Uniqlo (low level sales associate), and what we were told was basically the production branch commissions factories to produce garments and suppliers to source materials, and essentially the people from Uniqlo are mainly focusing on the QC of products and making sure the working standards of the commissioned factories are up to the legal standards of the local law. However true that information is i cannot confirm, then again the involvement of Uniqlo mentioned in the linked article above is not very informative, the following [piece](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-01/muji-uniqlo-flaunt-xinjiang-cotton-despite-uyghur-human-rights/11645612) sheds more light into the situation, though Uniqlo claims they don't have any partners in Xinjiang. Imho, their hands are definitely dirty, which is pretty hard to avoid given the products they try to offer in the price like this."
1738,2020-07-20 13:26:27,huecf1,"I agree that just because something is more expensive doesn't mean it's higher quality. Quality, luxury, durability, and price don't always go hand in hand, for sure.

There is no ""bar"" for quality. It's unfortunate but true.  There are also so many factors that the subdivisions for quality would be so vast it in itself would be confusing.

When I speak of volume, I mean ""volume"". Your high end designers and contemporary brands don't get price breaks. H&M, Fruit of the loom, Hanes, brands like those get price breaks. I would argue that a brand as small as mine and Gucci get charged the same for a tee. I would hardly call Gucci a small company.  I would also argue that a brand like pistol lake pays the same as Gustin.  There prices are the prices until you hit a number that very few brands can reach. It's not a matter of a brand like 3sixteen charging more than a brand like Fruit of the loom.  It's comparing apples to oranges and that's not marketing.

Maybe, I am not absorbing what the OP or you are saying but marketing is telling the consumer why your product is worth purchasing. Maybe, it's something visual like a model. It could be making something unobtainable so there is a desire to have it. Maybe, it's a cool back story on why the brand does what it does.

Marketing is not the cost break downs for each garment. Very very few brands will do that and they shouldn't have to. You don't ask for a line item for the groceries you buy. See where I am going here?"

You only have 3 hours as at 12pm PST, the sale items are either added or removed.

1746,2020-07-20 14:15:25,huecf1,"I see where you are going and I am not disagreeing.

But let's say you are at the grocery store. You look at one bag of grapes, and it's $3 bucks a pound. You look at the next bag of grapes and it's $5 a pound. There's no visible difference between the grapes, and the packaging has no information on it. What are you buying?

The $3 grapes. But then you might wonder if you might be missing out if you don't buy the $5 grapes and start to get curious, maybe they taste better, or are grown organically without being labeled that way? How would you know unless you buy both (or do a taste test in the store, which I'm not a fan of). The price itself is a form of marketing in this situation, because the consumer has to wonder what the basis for the increased price is, and since they don't know they may consider buying the more expensive product to find out."
1747,2020-07-20 06:05:23,huecf1,Just fixed the listing for UNI/FORM LA. I put the vintage wash version instead of their regular line one since it's 100% supima cotton.

1752,2020-07-20 15:05:24,huecf1,"I agree and you bring up a great point with the grapes. In fashion we do the same thing. An example made in Italy, extra long staples cotton, natural dyes, organic. It's no different than the grapes but the cost of the grapes are different and that's fine. The OP said no tee shirt should cost more than $40.00 and I am telling him that's false. That dude might ever buy the $5.00 grapes and that's cool but for the OP to say buying $5.00 grapes should never happen is false."
1753,2020-07-20 08:52:16,huecf1,"Only the 1994 Tees from J Crew are a heavier weight which will solve your problem. Their other offerings are just your typical thin, lightweight tees. I just wouldnt spend more than $20 on the 1994s

1769,2020-07-15 15:15:03,hromkk,I hope I end up with the number 2 pick in any draft that thinks like this.
1770,2020-07-15 14:39:28,hromkk,didn't tom hanks say that his antibodies to the virus are lower after time so he could potentially get it again
1771,2020-07-15 16:36:03,hromkk,"Ok ok... hear me out on this.  

For me, when drafting a RB, I value workload, an offense that scores a lot of points, the actual skill of the RB, and a good offensive line... in that order.(Also, I will mention my big money league isn't ppr, we started this league way before ppr was popular.)

That said, Zeke is the clear #1 RB for me.  McCaffrey is the man, but the Panthers are probably going to be bad this year and I assume defenses are gonna stack the box and focus on him.  Not that they didn't last year, but let's see if he can do it again.  I have my doubts, especially with Teddy ""the scrub"" Bridgewater as the new QB.  Very similar situation with Saquan. Bad team, not a lot of other studs to take the focus off.  For me, I would find it easier to argue for Kamara, Cook, or Henry, but I just think Zeke is better than them. So that's my take on it. I say Zeke #1 RB all day long this year.  At the bare minimum he is the safest pick."
1772,2020-07-15 15:50:30,hromkk,"The virus has a long tail of effects on some people recovering from it and we don't know what impact that will have on him. Could be like Darnold last year trying to come back from mono. 

I think there's a risk Zeke's workload is lower than it usually is, either because they pass more now they are stacked with pass catchers, or if they are mindful of Zeke's recovery and involve Pollard more in the first weeks of the season. 

CMC, Barkley and Kamara ahead of Zeke for me, Thomas too in PPR."

1782,2020-08-27 21:27:16,ihotlk,"That was written by an obvious normie with a primative entry level understanding and knowledge of true emo.""'Real Emo' only consists of the dc Emotional Hardcore scene and the late 90's Screamo scene."" Absolutely fucking wrong.1. If the implicating is that Emo is exclusive to the DC scene that was happening in the 80's, and that emo is EXCLUSIVE to that region on earth, then no. Emo may have had its inception there but anyone who truly knows emo knows that the genre quickly spread EVERYWHERE, even outside of the US to other continents. The second implication is that real emo is exclusive to the sound that bands were playing in those early days (e.g Rites of Spring, Embrace, Moss Icon etc etc) and no, absolutely fucking wrong. Emo was a genre that once planted its seed quickly grew and evolved. Which is why the band ""After words"" sound different from rites of spring, which is why the band Chino Horde sound different from After Words, which is why Indian Summer sound VERY different from rites of spring etc etc etc. TRUE emo has different sounds from the mid 80's sound to the 90's distinctive sound that you hear from bands like Cedar of Lebanon and Don Martin 3. People will try to argue that emo has evolved to inlcude bands like the get up kids and american football and to that I say ""Yes it has, but it does not include those fake emo bands. Bottom line is that Emo is far from being exclusive to DC in the 80s.2. ""The late 90's screamo scene?"" what the fuck is this? this is how you know that the person who runs ""memelords against furries and fake emo"" is a complete entry level normie. The page does nothing but Dickride bands like Orchid, Pg 99, loma Prieta, Suis la lune, city of caterpillar etc etc. While they are good bands, these guys are VERY late in the game. Orchid and Pg 99 literally play an evolution of screamo (screamo being an evolution of emo) that's more screamoviolence than pure screamo (again, because they were very late in the game). Loma Prieta are even LATER in the game and the shit they play has twinkle riffs everywhere (twinkle riffs are the bane of emo and are a clear signal of fake emo) Loma prieta do play screamo, but a very far evolved version of it. And suis la lune get the fuck out of my face, their music is so goddamn post rock influenced (albeit really good) that to note them as examples of pure EMO is asinine. The point is that the copy pasta wants to imply that Emo only consists of that 80s DC shit and the ""Late 90's screamo scene"" which is beyond fucking inaccurate because as we established, all those ""screamo"" bands that we mentioned are fucking late as hell in the game. Screamo started in the early 90's and was extremely prevalent in the French Hardcore scene, and when you actually listen to those bands (Jasemine, Anomie, Fingerprint, Ivich etc etc) you see that their TRUE screamo sound sounds MUCH different from Pg 99. THESE are the true screamo bands they are the TRUE EMO. Whoever wrote the copypasta literally knows hardly anything about screamo and is under the impression that ""screamo"" started late in the 90s and that is so fucking goddamn off. Bands like Orchid, Pg 99, Tristan tzarsa, iwrotehikus are to Screamo what I Hate Myself are to Emo. And Speaking of I hate myself, most of their music is Fake emo. THe only real emo song I've heard from them is the first track on ""Four Songs"". Bottom line is that all those screamo bands technically are screamo, but they are NOT what ""true emo"" or the ""true screamo scene"" is exclusive to. Far from it.So everything else this copy pasta goes at stems from this dude literally thinking that bands like Pg 99 are the true emo sound, which they aren't. Like how they say that real emo is HATEFUL. The distinction between Orchid and a pure emo band like Breakwater is so obvious that any normie could notice it. Characteristics of emo Yes they do include Hatefulness sometimes but True emo Sounds passionate, beautiful, melodic, Raw, Fast or slow, just pure and intense but still rather subtle and elegant as pretentious as that might sound. (like I said, emo has lots of different sounds and has many different feels)But yes, it's true, that whole ""post emo"" movement, the ""midwest emo"" shit, the ""twinkle mathy"" shit, and fucking the ""emo revival"" ALL OF THAT IS FAKE SHIT. ALL OF IT. I personally love bands like Mineral, SDRE, Get up Kids, Elliot etc etc but they aren't true emo. They have a slight influence but they don't like post harcore, they play stuff that sounds extremely light and poppy. But I'm going to say this now FUCK midwest, FUCK twinkle, FUCK ""emo revival"" which is the cringiest shit I've ever heard. These same people will try t say that calling bands like alesana and MCR 'emo' is fallacious yet they believe in the ""EMo revival"" which is the fakest emo you will ebver fucking get. Bands like American football are literally akin to fucking dashboard confessional. The fact that people will call American football an emo band is so fucking beyond even having the slightest bit of intelligence. Anyone who knows what emo is knows that it's a HARDCORE GENRE. Bands like MCR and ALESANA and THE USED (at least when they were starting) sounded an INFINITELY MANY times more True Emo than American football EVER WILL. The fact that american football get any fucking correlation to emo leaves me speechless. The fact that in any possible way AMERIcan Football can lumped in with the term ""emo"" let alone ""REAL emo"" is just, i have no fucking words.I've been on Fake Emo Patrol since 2014, and everytime I come across a get up kids or promise ring or american football video I always see way too many comemnts about emo, and I'm always happy to call y'all normies out and patroll fake emo. But ever since this shitty copypasta came out, now normies think they're on emo patrol and that they know what they're talking about. So now I have to deal with Posers who say that American Football are emo, AND I have to deal with posers who say that ""ReAl EmO OnLY CoNsIsTs of TheE DC sCeNeE and the LaTE 90s ScReAmo ScEnE"" fuck off. Shit makes me not even want to patrol anymore because all I ever see anywhere are normies who don't know what they're taling about. TRUE EMOS KNOW. We are the ascended ones. Whe watch you from above. We Stay rooted in the late 80s and the 90s, ascending gracefully to Emo eden through the sounds of true EMO bands. WE ARE THE ENLIGHTENED ONES, WE KNOW THE BEAUTY OF LIFE. I will continue to be chief of emo patrol, but this might be my last official statement or patrolling action. It's become something beyond me to bother with. there's no need to hope for humans to understand true emo, there's no hope in educating ""memelords against furries and fake emo"" Perhaps one day you will ascend (I personally was once like you, believing that emo meant SDRE, AF, orchid, Funeral diner, Lovelost but not forgotten) but for now, I won't bother anymoreShare the fuck out of thisLet my words be heard LONG LIVE TRUE SCREAMO

They  use their vehicles and addresses to hide their identity. Her drug dealing ex used cars her address and phone number to do crimes and stash money. So while investigating him they found Breanna Taylor's name all over everything. Thats why they had a search warrant for her house. And they knocked before entry when her bf shot at the police. So even though she was some what innocent the police had a legit warrant to be there

No, the shit you cut and pasted is a bullshit excuse by the police. People should still be angry. People should still be protesting. People should still be demanding change.

1892,2020-10-09 20:03:07,j84l8y,"I think this will be much closer than people are expecting. 

Wentz finally clicked and looked like himself for most of the game last week. This would be Week 1 of the Regular Season if he had a Pre-Season, so here's to hoping that he somehow accumulated more rust than most QB's and will be back to his top form this week. 

Our receiving corps made up of practice squad player play with heart, and even more surprisingly; talent. They are getting open and making great catches. Even without Desean or Alshon, I actually do believe in the corps enough to give Wentz a chance. 

Mailata will be under fire but god damn how cool would it be if he just fucking works that rush?

Boobie doesn't even need a blurb, he's been a stud and if we can get him going at all we are a threat to score from anywhere on the field. 

Defense concerns me less than it did. Yes, Mullens literally ended his career against them. But they seem to really be getting their swagger back, and Ben is usually good for at least a couple head scratching decisions every game; if we can capitalize, we may win the turnover battle. 

I think the surprise week off will hurt them more than it helped them and if we go in there with momentum and get a fast lead I think there's a real chance we don't give it up.

1893,2020-10-09 19:31:17,j84l8y,"Call me insane, or Joe Decamara, although it means the same thing, but Eagles are gonna find a way this week. 

27-23 Birds"
1894,2020-10-10 00:19:23,j84l8y,"The Steelers have beaten 3 of the worst teams in the league.  I know we aren’t playing great, but why is everyone so convinced this is a loss? I don’t think any outcome of this game will surprise me. 

Any given Sunday."
1895,2020-10-09 19:48:35,j84l8y,"Tyron Smith done for the season... Goddamn, this division is a fucking mess

5-10-1 might be enough to take the title"
1896,2020-10-09 19:21:51,j84l8y,"My bet is way lower scoring than people think, as our secondary finally clicks.

17-6 Steelers"
1897,2020-10-09 19:18:56,j84l8y,"The 49ers game, while a lot of fun, did not heal the pessimism I feel for our team in 2020. I think the Steelers are on a warpath and we are just a cobblestone on the road. 

Steelers 38 - Eagles 17"
1898,2020-10-09 18:55:50,j84l8y,"Unfortunately I see this being one step forward two steps back. 

Aslong as it is a competative game i will be okay with the result, but I feel the steelers will grind this one out. 

Pass rush needs to be at 100% Sunday, wents needs to be mobile and the fringe players need to step up again, we have starters coming back but done let that give you false home, they will need this game atleast to get back into the swing of things.

I am hopefully for a win but my gut tells me 24-20 loss.

Fly Eagles Fly

Fuck Dallas"
1899,2020-10-09 20:02:01,j84l8y,Bout to get our cheeks clapped. 31 - 20  Steelers

1901,2020-10-09 22:23:15,j84l8y,"Steelers are big favorites in the game for a reason, but I don't think this is unwinnable. We all thought we were gonna get obliterated by the Packers at Lambeau last year and look what happened."

1903,2020-10-09 19:33:42,j84l8y,"My gut feelings have been right for every game this season other than the Bengals game, and I’m feeling really confident about our boys this weekend. I’m calling a gutsy win that comes down the wire."
1904,2020-10-09 20:12:07,j84l8y,17-13 could go either way
1905,2020-10-09 21:05:42,j84l8y,Is that home wins in all the last 10 meetings...
1906,2020-10-09 21:24:49,j84l8y,"First Take with this clownish take: ""Eagles @ Steelers is a must-win for the Eagles"""
1907,2020-10-09 22:06:31,j84l8y,"Living in Pittsburgh after college, I wore my Alshon super bowl jersey to work. Plenty of comments to go around. I think we got a shot!

What should my next jersey be: Slay, Ward or Graham?"
1908,2020-10-10 00:28:33,j84l8y,QB runs will make or break this game
1909,2020-10-10 03:32:32,j84l8y,"First and foremost, Fuck Dallas! Second, as an NDSU Bison fan, I've also adopted the Eagles as my NFC team. So in this case, I'm hoping for Carson to continue righting the ship, an injury free game, and the Steelers coming out with a hard fought win. Great write up, tons of great info in there, for both sides!"
1910,2020-10-09 19:52:24,j84l8y,I expect a close game (and vintage Steelers playing down to their opponents). I also don't expect many TDs on either side. Both defenses are solid. I am gonna say Eagles win by a FG at 17-14.
1911,2020-10-09 23:17:10,j84l8y,"Carson’s completion percentage is not great but it’s 60% not 50%....

The only shot we have is Carson has to continue moving around the pocket, trust his WRs and take some chances, run the ball well and have the dline knock around Ben....it’s a tall task. Hope our guys are up to it."
1912,2020-10-10 18:57:46,j84l8y,I just hope we win! I know too many obnoxious steeler fans. Swear some of them are just as bad as Cowboys smh. Win this game! E-A-G-L-E-S!
1913,2020-10-10 20:11:21,j84l8y,20-17 birds
1914,2020-10-10 20:32:54,j84l8y,A true match up of first place titans.
1915,2020-10-10 20:56:14,j84l8y,"Eagles win thanks to two interceptions, one from Slay on a deep shot by Big Ben, and a sack fumble courtesy of Genard Avery. 

Eagles offense does just enough in the screen game to eek past the Steelers deadly pass rush. 

21-17 Eagles Win"
1916,2020-10-10 22:03:02,j84l8y,The Steelers are getting wayyyyy to much credit. All 3 of their wins are against bad teams. Maybe if they blew these teams out I’d understand the hype more but I’m not convinced. I’m calling another birds W tomorrow.
1917,2020-10-10 22:41:41,j84l8y,Unfortunately I think we will be the next easy team for the Steelers to beat leaving up the question if they are actually good. 24-13 Steelers.
1918,2020-10-11 02:12:16,j84l8y,We are winning this. Team is going to come out in sync and clicking. Taking down the 49ers was this years turning point. Team will start living up to its potential and defense will carry us.
1919,2020-10-11 02:52:54,j84l8y,We tend to play our best when we are supposed to lose.  Either way I have no expectations.
1920,2020-10-11 04:26:10,j84l8y,carson wentz has fucking sucked so far. hope he gets his shit together here but he prolly won’t. hope i’m wrong
1921,2020-10-11 05:52:09,j84l8y,"Unfortunately this week will probably be another blow to my fire Howie campaign.  Just as i did last week i am predicting the Eagles once again win in ugly fashion. The offense will be ugly of course and the linebackers will once again prove themselves to be perhaps the worst in the nfl but the line will play great, Mills and Slay will hold it down like they do, and Wentz, Sanders, and Ward will find a way to make just enough plays to get it done. 

The plus side to a win might be Howie finally deciding to take a look at making a trade for a legit nfl caliber linebacker."
1922,2020-10-09 19:17:33,j84l8y,I'm honestly rooting for TJ to get like 3 sacks. He deserves DPOY so bad
1923,2020-10-09 22:46:11,j84l8y,I had a dream last night that nick foles had a wildly successful career as a nude model after football.
1924,2020-10-09 21:45:06,j84l8y,"This game is going to be a blowout.

Steelers are a very good team healthy and tested. 

We are constantly more hurt than the week before. Wentz still is a big question mark."
1925,2020-10-09 22:38:42,j84l8y,"Steelers D will tee off on the Eagles Oline... 

Steelers Offense is steadily improving. Ben will be comeback player of the year, and play like it this Sunday.

Steelers over the Eagles 34-17"
1926,2020-10-09 21:12:57,j84l8y,Let's not mince that this is largely /u/rsubs33
1927,2020-10-10 03:14:31,j84l8y,"Steelers are for sure beatable. Daniel Jones of all QBs looked,  not competent,  great against them. They have weaknesses.  Their weapons have no more talent in offense than the eagles. Their defense is a couple great athletes with holes in coverage."
1928,2020-10-09 23:13:19,j84l8y,"Definitely a glass half full kinda guy, aren’t you?

Steelers blitz rate and ability to cause turnovers could make this game Carson’s worst of the year. Given the lack of weapons and playmakers, they’ll be teeing off on him. I genuinely think this will be a blowout. The matchup is not a good one. 

I can’t see how they score more points this week than they did last week considering Pittsburgh has no major injuries unlike SF."
1929,2020-10-10 20:14:41,j84l8y,I see this as a trap game for the Steelers honestly.
1930,2020-10-09 19:55:08,j84l8y,What blood sacrifice did we do to deserve this shit division?
1931,2020-10-09 19:53:35,j84l8y,Steelers aren’t scoring 38
1932,2020-10-09 19:29:28,j84l8y,The Steelers Offense is not that good. They haven’t faced any good teams this season. This will be much closer than that.
1933,2020-10-09 21:45:35,j84l8y,Totally agree
1934,2020-10-09 20:21:38,j84l8y,We were supposed to be a good team. I’m not gonna be happy with a “competitive game.” I understand that I shouldn’t expect a win but I’m bot gonna be OK with an L.
1935,2020-10-09 22:54:58,j84l8y,Fuck Dallas! I’m just hoping for a fun game.
1936,2020-10-09 22:41:51,j84l8y,Line is currently -7 last week was the same last week when we played the 49ers. The 49ers line actually pushed to -11 by game time. Just saying.
1937,2020-10-09 21:41:15,j84l8y,No 2000 and 1988 were both in Pitt and won by the Eagles.
1938,2020-10-09 22:28:11,j84l8y,Graham will be a good jersey at this point regardless of what happens
1939,2020-10-10 20:10:57,j84l8y,Good thing Carson has been more aggressive running it the last couple of games. Screw that old hamburger guy
1940,2020-10-09 20:23:43,j84l8y,Ah yes root for your QB to get sacked because you want an opposing player to get a pointless award.
1941,2020-10-09 22:27:41,j84l8y,"Lmao saved, the eagles defense been really decent and Darius slay has played extremely well, put slay on juju and outside of juju they don’t really have any proven talent, James Conor is good but vs our dline. Only thing I’m worried is our oline being inexperienced and getting destroyed on stunts and adjustments vs a very good Steelers defense"
1942,2020-10-09 21:59:39,j84l8y,It's awesome and I appreciate it - thanks to all involved.
1943,2020-10-10 02:32:46,j84l8y,"Steelers pressure rate is literally against 3 of the bottom 4 teams in the league. They have a combined 1-11 record and they would most likely all have been 0-4 had 2 of them not played each other. Their pass rush is good, but they aren't going to finish the season as high as they are currently ranked. San Fran was missing Bosa, but their pass rush without Bosa is still impressive and was handled decently with our patch work OL. Additionally, I think you are overrating Pittsburgh's offense. Their OL is average and the Eagles pass rush is just as impressive. They are a good team, but the game is gonna be closer than many think."
1944,2020-10-10 21:04:14,j84l8y,Who are the Steelers though? They’ve played opponents so far with a combine win-loss record of 1-11. This won’t be a blowout with the defense we have.
1945,2020-10-10 00:40:14,j84l8y,Carson already had his 7 INTs for the year.   He’s gonna have a perfect rest of the season.
1946,2020-10-10 20:19:26,j84l8y,"Yup, it feels a bit like last week. But the Steelers are healthy and it won’t be an easy win"
1947,2020-10-09 21:44:38,j84l8y,"Timeline shifted when we won the Superbowl.

Was it worth it? Of course."
1948,2020-10-11 20:07:28,j84l8y,You said?
1949,2020-10-09 19:55:46,j84l8y,"Haven’t needed to and won’t need to, but don’t tempt the Benjamin :p

Here’s to a fun game!"
1950,2020-10-09 23:14:55,j84l8y,I think they get 30+ due to short fields and a few big passing plays.
1951,2020-10-09 21:46:03,j84l8y,Washington’s offense wasn’t good either.
1952,2020-10-09 21:07:25,j84l8y,"Like the eagles are a good team lmao. Not saying it’s necessarily their fault, with injuries. Also not saying that it won’t be close, but if it is it won’t be because the eagles are a good team."
1953,2020-10-09 20:51:22,j84l8y,I came from the Steelers subreddit cus one of your guys linked it. Lemme set my flair
1954,2020-10-10 21:00:31,j84l8y,"Eagles finally having a little consistency on the O-line though. That is worth quite a bit as all each OL position played well individually last week, but had some errors in coordination. I expect them to be better this week."
1955,2020-10-10 04:23:17,j84l8y,"You saying we don’t have proven talent outside of Juju at WR shows me you know zero about Steelers football, so why comment on it?"
1956,2020-10-10 03:45:11,j84l8y,The Eagles offense is trash bro. Don’t kid yourself. Wentz (love the guy) but has been absolutely awful according to most metrics.
1957,2020-10-11 01:55:19,j84l8y,"You only play who is on your schedule. 

Eagles offense has yet to score 3 touchdowns in one game. I hardly expect that to happen versus one of the best defenses in the league. They have no one outside of Sanders that creates any yards after contact. Its going to take the best game of Wentz’s career"
1958,2020-10-10 20:20:49,j84l8y,"I mean, I’m not too worried about it. If it’s a defensive battle in the trenches, I’d take our rotation over any front, any day."
1959,2020-10-11 20:29:51,j84l8y,Glad to be wrong

1961,2020-10-09 22:28:51,j84l8y,Sorry for the other guy being a ass even though I’d feel the same way if a eagles fan was saying that
1962,2020-10-10 09:05:53,j84l8y,"Right? Diontae Johnson, Chase Claypool. They're pretty damn good."
1963,2020-10-11 02:09:47,j84l8y,"You are really overhyping what this game might be for the Steelers. The Steelers are nowhere near a threat as you think they are, they haven’t been since 2017. You act is if we are playing the chiefs. Very winnable game, very close. You go in there expecting a blowout if you want to."
1964,2020-10-11 20:34:26,j84l8y,I couldn’t help it lol.  It was a hell of a game though
1965,2020-10-11 01:56:50,j84l8y,"Well with those shit QBs last year, its understandable."
1966,2020-10-08 19:18:39,j7hvl4,It’s gonna be impossible to have anything like an objective discussion of the film.
1967,2020-10-08 19:45:00,j7hvl4,I liked it. I’m not a pedo. It’s a fine film.
1968,2020-10-08 23:19:58,j7hvl4,"It wasn't a bad movie. People condemning it based on social media rumors are the dumbest of the dumb. Think for yourselves, folks."
1969,2020-10-08 19:06:33,j7hvl4,"How controversial... big wow, pedo."
1970,2020-10-08 19:29:25,j7hvl4,"The problem isn’t with the message of the movie, the director has been very clear that the movie is supposed to be about how children are pressured into doing those things to themselves. The main problems are twofold, from what I understand (I haven’t seen it): that the children in the movie are played by real child actors who are not old and mature enough to properly consent to portraying themselves this way, and that the gratuitous uncensored depiction on film of children acting in a sexual manner is more or less free and consequence-less CP. if the same movie had been made but the sexual dance scenes had been implied rather than explicitly shown, I believe it would have avoided much of the controversy it has currently attracted. The explicitly communicated textual message of the film actually contains an important conversation to be had- what can we do, in the age of social media, to allow kids to stay kids until they’re really old enough to be ready to act like adults? How can we protect them from the social pressure to start acting like they’re 25 as soon as they turn 10? I don’t believe it was the intention of the director to sexualize children in a predatory manner (although I do believe it was the intention of the US Netflix advertising team for this movie to play up that aspect of it) but the fact that she used real child actors who aren’t old enough to understand what they agreed to portray and, intentionally or not, created a film that pedophiles can legally watch as much as they want while getting off to the images of real children sort of renders her intentions irrelevant."
1971,2020-10-08 20:46:48,j7hvl4,Why don’t you watch the movie before passing judgement on it?

It's pretty cool. They take a series of facial measurements (then into ratios), by picture, and will output your physiotype. There are strong correlates to MBTI types, yet the typing criteria measure significantly different aspects of personality."

2008,2020-10-02 01:45:54,j37gd8,Where would you go for first? And how many punches? Or would it be an emotional burst of energy and just wildly swing?
2009,2020-09-29 15:47:29,j21pyn,"Holy list, Batman!"
2010,2020-09-29 15:55:59,j21pyn,Kon. Factor in Paranoia Agent and the man is untouchable.

2039,2020-09-25 18:52:09,izp42q,I think if we lose this game we’re getting a Top 5 pick. It’s the Bengals at home. Burrow’s career is only 3 weeks old. We lose I don’t know what team we can beat.
2040,2020-09-25 18:37:37,izp42q,I hate getting my hopes up every week just to be disappointed. I wish I could be pessimistic so I always expect us to lose because then I'm either right or pleasantly surprised
2041,2020-09-25 19:10:47,izp42q,"This is a make or break game for the team. 

I hope to see our defensive front get through the Bengals poor o-line to Burrows for some sacks.

Would like to see a long TD pass from Wentz to Jackson.

I don't know if I will get these things but it's what I want."

2043,2020-09-25 22:00:35,izp42q,Anyone know who the Bengals starting tight end is? Because I can guarantee that guy will have a career game.
2044,2020-09-25 19:39:24,izp42q,This game preview is super impressive good job fellas
2045,2020-09-25 20:22:45,izp42q,Who else has no confidence in winning this game?
2046,2020-09-25 19:34:53,izp42q,Bengals fan. Happy to answer questions if I can.
2047,2020-09-25 19:40:48,izp42q,I feel like this is our last real chance for a win until the giants week 7. So we’d better hope they actually show up....
2048,2020-09-25 18:49:01,izp42q,Pain.
2049,2020-09-25 20:29:17,izp42q,"If we lose this game, we’re sellers. Howie needs to make some phone calls Monday morning and start trading guys for picks. Schedule gets exponentially more difficult after Sunday."
2050,2020-09-25 20:50:27,izp42q,I expect Lincoln Burrows to throw for at least 400 yards...
2051,2020-09-26 00:14:37,izp42q," ""The Eagles are off to their worst start since 2003 when they also dropped their first two games of the season. ""

2015 season lost first 2 games."

But I'm guessing it can't get much worse than this crap we've shown so far, so tomorrow I'm gonna wear it. Maybe the jersey curse was lifted"
2053,2020-09-26 18:07:50,izp42q,"Bengals fan here, grew up outside of Philly and went to school at Temple. Love the city and I follow the Eagles so I can shoot the shit with my dad who is a big fan. I’m upset I couldn’t fly out and go to the game, since I went to the last one between the two at the Linc (In 2012 iirc).

I wish you guys all the best, should be a fun game!"
2054,2020-09-26 00:37:10,izp42q,"The good news is I have recalibrated my expectations, and will be able to watch a full game no matter how bad it goes."
2055,2020-09-25 19:16:04,izp42q,[deleted]
2056,2020-09-26 01:30:45,izp42q,If we don't win by 3 scores I'll be disappointed.
2057,2020-09-26 05:39:09,izp42q,Just want to say you guys are way better than that 'other' Pennsylvania team.
2058,2020-09-26 20:02:11,izp42q,"Defense is making me want to bash my head against the wall. I don't care about how good your CBs are, if they play so far off the LoS, they're going to get beat by a twitchy receiver. Slay clamped down on McLaurin in week one, and was able to handle him. Even Maddox had a good day that day. Against the Rams? Nope, Schwartz went back to the same shit."
2059,2020-09-26 20:27:03,izp42q,"I am feeling this as the game to get the Eagles on track. Last year was bad with Seattle and New England, then the offense came back against the Dolphins (defense unfortunately fell apart that game). I have that same feeling now for them. If they win tomorrow I think they’ll also win next week and be in a good spot given the start of the season."
2060,2020-09-27 01:35:43,izp42q,All I can think about is the shit show that will be everything surrounding this team if they lose. Even if they win narrowly the perception of this team is going to dark depths not seen in a long time.
2061,2020-09-27 07:00:07,izp42q,"First off, I love this preview thread, so much information and it was a lot of fun to read! 
If you have any questions for a Bengals fan, ask away!"
2062,2020-09-27 15:33:41,izp42q,Is Fletcher Cox playing today?
2063,2020-09-27 17:19:16,izp42q,Defense bailing out captain turnover again. I've lost all confidence in carson

2065,2020-09-27 17:28:19,izp42q,holy shit vintage wentz!
2066,2020-09-27 21:52:18,izp42q,"Bengals, Eagles and ties.  
Name a more iconic trio."
2067,2020-09-25 18:45:37,izp42q,"I like all the information, but the sliding charts is very inconvenient to read on mobile. Not sure how it looks in browser, though."
2068,2020-09-26 16:38:44,izp42q,"This is a game we should absolutely 100% win. Our roster has looked pretty bad, but all the Bengals have literally is Joe Burrow. If our defense line can keep him occupied from throwing the football we should be able to win this game. Joe Mixon hasn’t shown up either because of how horrid the Bengals offensive line is.

We lose this game however... we could be on our way to a Top 10 draft pick."
2069,2020-09-25 19:33:57,izp42q,You know the eagles will give us false hope and beat the Ravens.
2070,2020-09-25 22:25:02,izp42q,"We have to dominate, not just win... Anything less than that will be a disappointment"
2071,2020-09-26 00:29:16,izp42q,"I never want to lose, but a top 5 pick would be SO much nicer than sneaking into the playoffs in a bad division just to lose the first game."
2072,2020-09-26 02:49:53,izp42q,"I am sure everyone will just say “it’s only week 3, stop overreacting.”"
2073,2020-09-27 01:32:34,izp42q,If we lose this game then I think the calls for Wentz to be bench are warranted.
2074,2020-09-25 18:54:39,izp42q,"I’m in that latter category now and it’s made football a bit easier. This team just doesn’t bring much emotion out of me anymore. They don’t seem to be playing with any emotion and I’m not so sure  they deserve mine. I feel like that’s a bad thing, but I am near numb"
2075,2020-09-25 19:18:53,izp42q,"The first thing is more likely than the second. As much as people shit on Bobby Hart, it was the OG's who were getting destroyed by the Browns last week. Line Cox up against Fred Johnson and watch Fletcher put him on roller skates.

Bengals DBs have played decently, especially WJ3, but if you can run the ball well it could open up the deep stuff."
2076,2020-09-25 23:00:21,izp42q,"Dunno about make it. But boy if we lose its definitely break. 

The only constant is that if you think eagles are at rock bottom, they'll suprise you."
2077,2020-09-25 19:38:26,izp42q,Nonono don't listen to this guy pass it
2078,2020-09-25 21:48:56,izp42q,Just not on stretch plays to the right.
2079,2020-09-27 01:12:39,izp42q,"Wentz: I'm throwing to Ertz, whether he's open or not!"
2080,2020-09-26 01:44:43,izp42q,"Bengals fan. Its probably gonna be drew sample. Guys not terrible, not amazing. Quick question though, how are your cornerbacks going so far this year? WR is our most stacked position so I’m curious how you guys think they’ll match vs AJ and Co."
2081,2020-09-27 07:08:03,izp42q,"It will be Drew Sample, we also Ceethan Carter and Mason Schreck. Sample looked better than normal last week but he's mainly a blocking TE. The other two are hit or miss, i wouldn't be too worried about them tbh"
2082,2020-09-27 07:14:19,izp42q,"If they don’t, this is a 4-12 season at best."
2083,2020-09-25 20:50:58,izp42q,How’s the Oline? I’m wondering if we could maybe see our DLine get going this week.
2084,2020-09-25 22:26:11,izp42q,Is your defense any good? What are their strengths and weaknesses?
2085,2020-09-26 20:06:15,izp42q,49ers are very injured too so I can see us getting a win
2086,2020-09-26 00:21:44,izp42q,Chip Kelly years never happened. #fuckchipkelly
2087,2020-09-27 06:05:17,izp42q,I’ll throw mine on too for good measure.
2088,2020-09-26 19:04:04,izp42q,"Yep. When you tell yourself we are tanking this year, it makes it fun again."
2089,2020-09-25 19:22:07,izp42q,That's an issue with mobile. Shows up correctly on desktop.
2090,2020-09-27 16:20:20,izp42q,Supposed to play currently. May be on a snap count tho
2091,2020-09-25 19:03:22,izp42q,"Post is created in desktop with that being the main audience. With the official reddit app. It isn't optimized to auto adjust the table width to fit the screen. Even tho we use reddits own formatting.

Edit: fixed to explain."
2092,2020-09-27 07:13:07,izp42q,"We honestly have some pretty good players on both sides of the ball. The issue with our defense is the DC more than the players. (Imo) and out receiving corps is pretty solid. 

Now do I think we will? Who knows neither teams are giving off a lot of good feelings, i just hope it'll be a good game lol"
2093,2020-09-25 22:57:44,izp42q,Welp
2094,2020-09-26 01:06:04,izp42q,And with our luck we get the top 5 pick in a very shaky draft where the NCAA only played like half a season
2095,2020-09-27 01:17:00,izp42q,"Fuck that. I want the banner.I don't want to watch Dallas or the team with no name in January. There is nothing worse than watching football in January with no hope of anything. Bullshit! I want another fucking NFCE championship. Fuck Dallas! You really watch to watch Dak and listen to their fans and the media suck his dick into January? Jesus Christ!  Or if it's between Dallas and Team, do you really want to be rooting for goddamned Nameless Team in December and January, simply hoping it's not Dallas? Fuck That Mess!
No. I want to see Wentz carry us into the playoffs, where anything can happen (see Giants years ago as wildcard team).

Fuck Dallas, Fuck Nameless, and I just feel sorry for the Giants."
2096,2020-09-27 01:33:58,izp42q,"Now that I’ve gotten into soccer, this kind of upsets me. I hate that the NFL incentivizes failure with draft picks."
2097,2020-09-26 07:22:08,izp42q,I think week 3 is the make or break week for the start of a season. 1-2 or 0-3 is a big difference imo.
2098,2020-09-26 03:42:28,izp42q,"""Dude its only week 15. Relax. All we have to do is travel back in time and win"""
2099,2020-09-26 07:49:53,izp42q,"Nah, I was like that the first 2 weeks. Week 3 is where we see what this team is really made of. I think the Eagles will be fine this season. They've shown drastic improvement from game to game and I personally believe they can keep it up. But if we look bad this week, this season is in huge trouble."
2100,2020-09-25 19:35:03,izp42q,I wish I can be like this.  For 3 hrs and 20 mins I'm on a roller coaster of emotions.
2101,2020-09-26 16:07:33,izp42q,I would love to see Wentz just freak the fuck out just once. Maybe it’s just me but I get so frustrated of his “aw dangit” attitude when something goes wrong and the game is on the line
2102,2020-09-25 20:35:30,izp42q,"This is why I'm confused about people saying give Fred the start over Bobby ""what's the worst that can happen"". The worst that can happen is Fred is worse than Hart and gets Burrow injured."
2103,2020-09-25 19:20:53,izp42q,"I imagine we will rely heavily on the run this game (as we should) 

It would just boost my morale (like on a personal level) to see a long competition. Like just one. Anything."
2104,2020-09-26 03:56:16,izp42q,"Corner has been pretty solid, all things considered. Slay has been what we’ve been lacking and hasn’t really allowed his guy to do much through two games. Kupp was running free against us last week, but that partially falls more on the safeties and LBs. Robey-Coleman (slot) didn’t have a great game either.  
  
So overall, CB is better than past years. Maddox (CB2) can be beat but he isn’t an absolute liability."
2105,2020-09-26 12:08:43,izp42q,Cornerback is solid but LBs are playing like Hellen Keller in Stephen Hawking’s wheel chair.
2106,2020-09-26 04:47:44,izp42q,"AJG will have Slay on him. our CB2 is Maddox who is pretty good but a little undersized. Slot CB is Nickel Robey-Coleman but he had a very bad game last week from being out of place constantly,. although I'm pretty sure that was our shit D scheme vs the Rams good scheme."
2107,2020-09-26 14:36:40,izp42q,"CBS are not bad, Slay has been everything we thought he would, Maddox is serviceable as an outside corner, NRC has been decent. One man cannot make a secondary though, and our LBs and Safeties are not good, to put it lightlt"
2108,2020-09-25 21:17:02,izp42q,"The short answer is: it's a problem. Both of our guards had terrible games last week against the Browns. LG Michael Jordan was pretty decent in the opener, and showed improvement in the second half of rookie year last season, so the hope is that last week is the outlier. Fred Johnson started at RG last week after starter Sua-Filo (spelled wrong, IDC) was hurt, and looked awful. Coaches are blaming it on the fact that he hadn't gotten any reps at guard in actual practice (he's the backup swing tackle) since it was a short week. He's playing right next to actual piece of garbage Bobby Hart, so the right side of the line is pretty suspect in pass pro. Hart is actually a very good run blocker, so look for the Bengals to try to power run to the right side of the line early. We should see pretty quickly if Johnson is up to the task there. 

Your DTs should be excited about going to against our IOL and getting after Burrow."
2109,2020-09-25 22:48:38,izp42q,"I think that historically the Bengals have had a similar philosophy to the Eagles in tends of how they've built defenses. Invest in the line and the CBs, linebacker is not something they've prioritized.

That said, the defense was on pace to set nearly every record in the book at the half way point last season, and not in a good way. They showed some improvement down the stretch, but the team still felt they needed to overhaul things, so they signed DTs DJ Reader (Hou), Mike Daniels (Det), LB Josh Bynes (Bal), Safety Vonn Bell (NO) and CBs Mackenzie Alexander and Trae Waynes (Min), plus drafted 3 LBs. All those new guys have shown mixed results through two games. 

The Browns were able to run it down our throats, and then set up big plays with play action. Geno Atkins is still out, and I think you guys can do similar, but maybe use your elite TEs to take advantage of the two rookie LBs that are the Bengals nickel LBs. Safety Jesse Bates could be one to watch, as he had a fantastic first game (93+ PFF rating) and then led the team with something like 7 missed tackles last week.

I know your O-line has been bad, but our D line hasn't been good either, generating one sack through two games. There is some talent there with Lawson, Hubbard and Dunlop, so we'll see how that shakes out. The stoppable force vs the moveable object right there."
2110,2020-09-26 20:09:06,izp42q,"That’s fair, now looking at how depleted they are."
2111,2020-09-26 00:51:45,izp42q,"With only coaching 3 seasons, and 2 of them being 10-6 with one leading into post season, it wasn't that bad. Yes 2015 sucked, obviously not as bad as 2012 or 1998. Don't get me wrong, not a big fan of Kelly, but not statistically the worst."
2112,2020-09-25 19:05:13,izp42q,"I'm on the official app. You have to continously slide on the tabs such as the ones under Matchups to Watch to read, that's what I was talking about."
2113,2020-09-26 12:07:00,izp42q,Better take an OL or a DL then
2114,2020-09-26 15:56:30,izp42q,"That’s not an issue at the top of the draft.

The extra 5 games of tape is really helpful for the mid to late round guys.

For top 5 guys you pretty much know based off previous years and some games this year.

Like most of the top 5 could have sat out the year."
2115,2020-09-27 15:34:15,izp42q,"I really want to win too tbh! Tanking is for suckers, not losers! Wait...

Anyways, I REALLY want to be the first back-to-back champion in the division since our threepeat from '02-'04."
2116,2020-09-26 01:33:09,izp42q,And that's why we do it. I couldn't imagine being a bottom 5 team every year and just not feeling anything for your team. Atleast they make it exciting.
2117,2020-09-27 14:43:53,izp42q,"I’ll see your pain and raise you 9 seasons spent watching Andy Dalton’s post interception “I did something bad” grin, with zero playoff wins."
2118,2020-09-25 21:20:03,izp42q,"People are saying that because the story the whole off-season was that it was going to be an open competition in camp between Hart and Johnson for the RT job, but when they got to camp Johnson didn't get any reps with the first team at all until almost the last week, and those were just practicing filling in for injury. Those people still think that had he been given the full chance at the job, he might've taken it. I'm not saying they're right, I just think that's the idea."
2119,2020-09-25 19:27:25,izp42q,I just think that with Reagor out that means Jackson will be going up against Will Jackson. I think it's now likely that your elite TEs will do serious work against our 2 rookie nickel linebackers.
2120,2020-09-26 16:43:50,izp42q,That’s where I think it’ll come down to tbh. We can’t reply on the o line to give mixon some space so if AJ can get some separation and/or Boyd can light Maddox up I think we got a shot. Otherwise it’s probably curtains. Good luck on Sunday.
2121,2020-09-26 01:31:42,izp42q,"Thank you for the write up man! Also thanks for ur answers to other birds fans throughout this thread. I just wanna say the bengals are my 2nd favorite team because when I was 11 I was on the bengals (flag football team) when we won the league championship, so they’ll have a special place in my heart. Aside from this week I wish you and your team the best!"

As for Kelly, he inherited a talented team playing a last place schedule when NFCE was arguably the worst it has been in the last 25 years. His gimmick offense was something DCs weren't ready for right away. League began catching up in year two and he took a playoff team to a rebuilding in record time. Guy was not a good coach and an even worse GM."
2124,2020-09-25 19:06:56,izp42q,I see what you are talking about. Can't help you there. That's reddits shitty app reading their own formatting. It shows up as a paragraph on desktop
2125,2020-09-26 17:00:54,izp42q,Does Boyd primarily line up in the slot or play outside?
2126,2020-09-26 01:41:35,izp42q,"Hey, no problem. I was full of caffeine, so I was feeling a little longwinded. Over on r/Bengals there's a meet the enemy thread from the other day in case you want to check out some more Q&A. 

I can't say the Eagles are my second favorite team, but I *do* hate the cowboys, and I feel like maybe that's just as good in your books.

Here's to an injury-free game!"
2127,2020-09-26 00:11:12,izp42q,"I shoulda put a tl;dr: 

Defense could be good eventually, isn't yet. Run the ball; exploit the linebackers."
2128,2020-09-25 19:08:25,izp42q,"I see. Does the app automatically make the entire post conform to the first used format or something?

2132,2020-09-26 04:42:18,izp42q,yeah fuck the cowboys
2133,2020-09-25 19:16:24,izp42q,"The entire post is formatted in tables. Where it is a text paragraph it's a single row table with a header. Regardless the issue is with the app, which we can't fix."

2137,2020-09-26 05:30:01,izp42q,heyyy alright you love to hear it. At least we copped one of those SB's
2138,2020-09-26 05:45:40,izp42q,I was the only one at that super bowl party rooting for TO and Donovan. It wasn't cool to hate the Patriots yet.

2140,2020-09-27 01:08:47,izp42q,"Yeah, really tough to root against Cam. Say what you will about his weird font, I admire the dude for the fact that he can just be himself no matter what others might say."
2141,2020-09-27 01:47:33,izp42q,He in it now for the respect and I respect the hell outta that.
2142,2020-09-18 17:23:41,iv98r4,"Really excited for this game , even though Philly always finds away to come out on top. I'll feel much less distraught if we lose to y'all ass opposed to Dallas. Your defense seems to always be built perfectly to face us.

Really looking forward to seeing our defense against y'all. Dallas was supposed to come out guns blazing and we held them to 17. I wonder if our defense will try to be more agressive/play more man this week. 

 Good luck to the eagles!"
2143,2020-09-18 18:01:52,iv98r4,"Can't wait to see Miles do his thing. Wentz needs to shake off last week, get his mind right and just play ball. Anticipating a huge game from both of them. Really curious to see if our secondary is actually any better than last year."
2144,2020-09-18 16:32:07,iv98r4,"Rams fan here: nobody will ever convince me otherwise that Goff, Wentz and Dak are all really just 1A, 1B, and 1C, and further that if we flipped everything around and everyone got a different an of the three we would all staunchly defend that QB as the best of the draft. They all have their strengths and weakness and it’s great fun to watch them duel."
2145,2020-09-18 20:53:28,iv98r4,"Remember, don’t be to hyped when we are up 24-3 at halftime."
2146,2020-09-18 16:52:38,iv98r4,"First chance to see if our secondary is actually upgraded. I don't expect a lot of deep shots from the Rams offense and going to assume the run game has minimal impact as it tends to against our D-line. Assuming NRC stays on Cupp and Slay lines up against Woods it'll be important to watch Higbee against our LBs and Jefferson on Maddox.

We've done well at keeping Donald contained in the past but I don't see that happening this time, fortunately LA doesn't have the same number of good pass rushers and depth as Washington and with Lane back it looks much better for Carson. TEs are going to continue to do what they do, and it'll be interesting with who Ramsey covers."
2147,2020-09-19 02:37:37,iv98r4,"Holy fucking christ this is such a good post. Hat's off, my friend. Not a stone unturned or an inch uncovered. Can't fucking wait! Couldn't figure out the flair on here, but I come, in peace, from the Rams sub."

2150,2020-09-18 21:11:59,iv98r4,"Great injury report today. Also encouraging that the betting market has shifted in favor of the Birds, who went from being a small underdog early in the week to now being a small favorite."
2151,2020-09-19 08:11:32,iv98r4,"Rams fan here, excited for this game! Good luck to you guys, hope everyone stays healthy on both sides of the ball. Hate seeing so many injuries, but especially so early in the season."
2152,2020-09-19 21:47:04,iv98r4,"The last two years have been more butthole clenching than they needed to be. Let’s hope this year isn’t the same. 

A nice comfortable win here would do a lot to alleviate some fear. I would rather save the stress for the playoffs. 

This team has been such a roller coaster. Capable of greatness and capable of embarrassment. 

Any given Sunday I guess."
2153,2020-09-20 12:26:42,iv98r4,hopefully Wentz doesn't get hit too much today and Pederson actually makes adjustments when needed
2154,2020-09-19 02:37:50,iv98r4,I think the Rams are going to smush us
2155,2020-09-20 16:46:01,iv98r4,Malcolm is still listed as a Pro-Bowler on our roster lol
2156,2020-09-19 20:22:12,iv98r4,"If Hurts never dresses and (assuming Wentz gets back on track) he isn’t a part of the future, are we allowed to question a luxury pick at 53 yet?"

2160,2020-09-20 16:21:27,iv98r4,I am frightened. Defense needs to feast today otherwise it's going to be a very long Sunday.
2161,2020-09-20 17:24:51,iv98r4,If we continue to turn the ball over we will continue to lose
2162,2020-09-19 11:09:03,iv98r4,It's been a long time since I've been this apathetic about an Eagles game. I hope they give me a reason for that to change or it's going to be a sad sad season
2163,2020-09-20 17:05:56,iv98r4,Lol kid thinks he’s elite
2164,2020-09-18 18:02:11,iv98r4,"It should be a game.  I don’t feel like we *need* an Eagles win, but we definitely need to prove that last week was a fluke by playing hard."
2165,2020-09-20 15:29:20,iv98r4,Good luck today dude!
2166,2020-09-18 17:20:04,iv98r4,"I think Wentz has displayed the highest ceiling. He's also displayed the most flaws.

If he finds consistency in his game, I'd put him #1. Until that happens, I just can't justify it."
2167,2020-09-19 11:03:16,iv98r4,Two of them have put their teams into SB position. Dak truthers pride their arguments against teams with losing records. Carry on.
2168,2020-09-18 16:33:30,iv98r4,Hate to break it to you but Dak and Wentz are worlds more talented than Goff. Sorry.
2169,2020-09-18 18:46:06,iv98r4,"You’re right on the money with the match ups, hoping for a competitive game, with no injuries. It’s probably going to end up coming down to how our secondary performs, vs Wentz ability to throw and make someone open by buying time."
2170,2020-09-19 15:40:11,iv98r4,My biggest concern is NRC's ability to sniff out a screen pass and I can see it biting us in the ass this weekend.
2171,2020-09-19 04:31:45,iv98r4,Nah there were so many Eagles fans 2017 was a home game. You are right but I am too lazy to change on my phone.

2173,2020-09-19 04:52:41,iv98r4,It’s honestly the best game of the week to bet on lmao. I’ll take this spread any day of the week with a game like this!
2174,2020-09-20 00:20:06,iv98r4,Football game of inches
2175,2020-09-20 17:15:06,iv98r4,It was the Eagles Pro Bowlers from last season sport.
2176,2020-09-20 17:08:23,iv98r4,Assuming Wentz gets back on track....
2177,2020-09-18 20:12:34,iv98r4,"Yeah, I don't have much (or any) hope of winning when we've got to put Nate Herbig against Aaron Donald, but a competitive game would go a long way towards unraveling this knot in my stomach..."
2178,2020-09-18 18:04:56,iv98r4,I agree I’m a wentz fan and he has definitely showed us what he can do he just hasn’t been doing it or maybe he hasnt been able to given he has been lacking depth around him and doing what he can with what he has but I feel as though sometimes he just makes mistakes that seem rookie esque and it really brings me pain to watch
2179,2020-09-20 11:43:11,iv98r4,"I think goff has the most flaws, Wentz has the highest ceiling, and dak has the highest floor but the lowest ceiling. Put dak on this team right now and he’s definitely average at best. I think Wentz is the only one out of the 3 who would be capable of carrying a team like he did last season."
2180,2020-09-18 16:40:27,iv98r4,"also rams fan here, what makes you say that? I see Goff as having a better arm than Dak and being better than him. 

&#x200B;

Haven't watched Wentz play much lately so I can't really claim to have an informed opinion on that."
2181,2020-09-18 17:20:00,iv98r4,World's more feels like a stretch. I feel like in 4 years each one of them has had an objectively better season than the other two with the first season being a toss up sans Goff.
2182,2020-09-20 16:45:43,iv98r4,"> Dak and Wentz are **worlds** more talented than Goff

Nah.. I love Wentz, but he's not THAT MUCH more talented than Goff.. You can argue that he's better, but not that much..

Also, Goff has the best arm talent out of those 3.."
2183,2020-09-20 20:07:44,iv98r4,“Worlds better”
2184,2020-09-20 20:13:58,iv98r4,Sure didn’t look that way this afternoon bud
2185,2020-09-20 21:09:16,iv98r4,Aged like milk buddy
2186,2020-09-18 17:12:50,iv98r4,"Wentz is talented at fumbling the ball and finding ways to run outside of the pocket and get hurt. When he stays in the pocket, he’s a deer in headlights and gets sacked 8 times.

Wentz had talent in 2017, but he’s reached his ceiling. Goff isn’t flashy, but is much more reliable than Wentz. You’d be a fool to take Wentz over Goff in 2020."
2187,2020-09-18 16:35:34,iv98r4,Being able to start a playoff game is part of being talented
2188,2020-09-20 17:09:03,iv98r4,Well from that hideous second half last week I meant
2189,2020-09-19 02:37:10,iv98r4,He never gives up on a play and its a recipe for disaster when the line gave him zero time last week. Oh well - he will get better.
2190,2020-09-18 16:41:20,iv98r4,Dak has a much better ability to escape the pocket as little as i like to admit it
2191,2020-09-20 12:49:23,iv98r4,"It's mostly conjecture at this point because we can't swap QBs around each of our teams, but it definitely seems like Dak and Goff aren't as likely to win a game on their own. They both have had a great running game to rely on for most of their careers, while Wentz has primarily had to do it himself. 

If we put Dak or Goff on the Eagles these past few years I'm not sure we hit .500. Dan Orvlosky had a good interview the other day comparing Wentz to Stafford which I really agree with. He'll make the most ridiculous plays but also throw out a bone-headed play from time to time simply because he always thinks he can make it work. 

I admittedly haven't watched as much Dak or Goff as I have Wentz but from what I've seen, those 2 do a better job taking what's given to them, while Wentz makes something out of nothing much more often."
2192,2020-09-20 20:09:39,iv98r4,Ok i get it but if youre gonna mock-quote someone at least use the same words they did
2193,2020-09-20 20:21:19,iv98r4,"Yeah I think could tell, because I'm not blind and deaf. Thanks for reminding me..."
2194,2020-09-20 21:10:51,iv98r4,"Yeah I think I know that, thanks for the excellent observation"
2195,2020-09-18 17:21:53,iv98r4,"The majority of Wentz' injuries have been flukey and I'm happy to argue with you about it, if you want."
2196,2020-09-18 17:24:44,iv98r4,"You think getting sacked 8 times was entirely his fault

I think that says enough about you to the point where you shouldn't even be allowed to debate people"
2197,2020-09-18 18:53:00,iv98r4,This sub will get butt hurt over this comment but it’s unfortunately true
2198,2020-09-18 16:38:30,iv98r4,"You do know he has started in our most recent playoff game? 

Now go ahead and make a dumb comment that he didn’t finish because Clowney drove his head into the ground."
2199,2020-09-18 16:37:46,iv98r4,"No, it is not."
2200,2020-09-20 17:15:19,iv98r4,He won't rebound if he doesn't learn to throw the ball away from time to time lol
2201,2020-09-18 16:43:07,iv98r4,That’s fair and I agree. I don’t think that makes him a better QB though
2202,2020-09-18 16:50:24,iv98r4,"Sure, but he's also a worse passer"
2203,2020-09-18 18:01:21,iv98r4,"So dak is better because he escapes the pocket better... ok what else? Also, what does Carson do that’s so much better than Goff? I think it’s completely fair to say they all are pretty equal."
2204,2020-09-20 20:11:43,iv98r4,"Your right, my bad, just wanted to be petty. Have a good day sir."
2205,2020-09-20 20:22:48,iv98r4,"I’m just saying, ask three have their days. Give Goff a month and we’ll be shitting on him again. They take their turns. None is consistently great. It happens."
2206,2020-09-20 21:15:28,iv98r4,No prob 👍
2207,2020-09-18 17:27:25,iv98r4,Every analyst has said he was responsible for at least half to them. He held the ball too long and never got rid of it. That’s not even a debate.
2208,2020-09-18 16:45:05,iv98r4,"I was being pretty reductive with that comment because it annoys me when people make claims like that about Goff especially when the guy was being pretty non-combative, so I'll say something more intelligent

All 3 of the QBs have their ups and downs. Wentz is great, but he HAS struggled with injuries and obviously the dirty Clowney play isn't his fault but it's already been a pattern with his career. Dak likewise has flashes of brilliance but other times seems unable to win even with how stout his offense is. Goff put together an MVP campaign for the first half of 2018 and obviously struggled a bit down the stretch but still brought his team with an ailing Gurley to the super bowl. How is it that because he struggled after getting a big contract, Dak and Wentz are just ""worlds more talented"" than him? I get it if people think they're better, I wouldn't dispute it being close, but I don't see ""worlds"""
2209,2020-09-18 18:02:48,iv98r4,"For carson:

- Stronger arm

- better running ability

- similar passing, maybe slightly worse 

- worse decision making

I think that would make him better."
2210,2020-09-20 11:44:40,iv98r4,"Did you see the eagles and the rams last year? Wentz carried a team on life support at the skill position, on defense to the playoffs. He had zero help. Goff has literally only ever been impressive for one season with a loaded roaster."

Even if you're not being charitable, I think putting more than 3/8 on Wentz is really weird."
2212,2020-09-18 17:29:01,iv98r4,"The same analysts who think Dak is better, presumably. So I dont think their opinion should be valued :)"
2213,2020-09-18 16:46:49,iv98r4,"Goff is a game-manager. 

Wentz makes plays Goff will likely never make"
2214,2020-09-18 22:49:59,iv98r4,"Isn't Goffs main weakness decision making once things don't go according to plan? 

Haven't watched much Wentz but hearing he's supposed to be worse at it is surprising."
2215,2020-09-18 18:05:41,iv98r4,"Goff is the superior passer, I’d argue there arms are pretty similar (I’d say Goff is better, but it’s really never been McVay’s game plan to throw bombs downfield). Basically the only knock Goff has compared to Wentz and Dak is that he isn’t as mobile. Again, I think all 3 are pretty equal."
2216,2020-09-20 21:29:15,iv98r4,"Lol, carried a team to the playoffs in a division that we would have won with our record last year. Was nice to see Goff cap off the Dak/Wentz consecutive W’s this week. 

Hope Goff keeps showing people he was the right pick a couple of years ago."
2217,2020-09-18 17:39:23,iv98r4,"Lmao you’re right. Wentz is an elite QB and has been since he came into the league. My bad, I don’t even know why I expected objectivity from y’all."
2218,2020-09-18 16:54:45,iv98r4,"I feel like you haven't actually watched the Rams. Goff is a great passer, it's the other things that are his weakness. I wish he were better at managing games."
2219,2020-09-18 17:21:53,iv98r4,"Any time someone says any version of ""Goff doesn't make plays"" I immediately assume they haven't seen enough Rams games. If anything he tends to be too proned to take risks. He's usually top of the league in big time throws, tight window throws,and turnover worthy throws lol."
2220,2020-09-18 22:52:24,iv98r4,"Wentz has pretty bad decision making when it comes to holding on to the ball too long and trying to make impossible plays. Granted, he makes some incredible plays but he needs to learn when something is just impossible"
2221,2020-09-19 15:38:48,iv98r4,That's been a knock but he's already shown in one game that he will throw the ball away if it's a dead play and that's worlds better than what he showed last season.
2222,2020-09-18 18:08:54,iv98r4,"Hmm interested as to why you think goff has a better arm.

Wentz throws bullets."
2223,2020-09-18 17:41:50,iv98r4,"Oh so I just checked your post history and that r/nfl post makes you look like a clown

Literally *none of us* (or only a very small percentage of us) think Wentz is top 5"
2224,2020-09-18 21:07:35,iv98r4,"I feel sad that Goff will probably have the Brady/Bellichick problem until he separates with McVay.

People aren't willing to give him much credit as a passer (other than his pretty sweet deep passes) because they think he's not using his head and just doing what McVay says to do in the short/intermediate pass game."

2230,2020-09-18 18:19:18,iv98r4,"When did i agree with you?

And that small percentage of people is the vast minority, meaning your point that that is what eagles fans think is false."
2231,2020-09-18 19:46:54,iv98r4,"I’ll take accuracy over strength any day of the week, especially Sunday."
2232,2020-09-18 20:48:15,iv98r4,"Goff had the highest mph reading at the combine for the big 3 of that draft and has been the season leader for longest air yard completions in the nfl like 2 or 3 times. Usually in the top 3 as well i think he fell of in that respect last season though.

By no means does that mean that is a common opinion at all.

The way I saw it (just my opinion) Szeth starts of taking a great level of responsibility for his actions, especially in WoK. But then, as his actions get worst and the guilt starts pilling on (and his sanity becomes a bit debatable lol), he develops a slight defense mechanism of blaming others for it so that he doesn’t have to feel the guilt anymore. For example, he starts blaming the victims when he’s killing them for making wrong decisions. A lot of this does stem from his religious beliefs though, which I’m glad you brought up. My point stemmed from the scene where Szeth thinks something along the lines of “it was always just a rock” (forgot the phrasing). When I read that I saw it as him realizing that what Kal said to him in their fight was, if not only partly, right. He didn’t have to do the things he did, but he decided to shift the blame to his masters because of a mix of religious and personal beliefs ... idk though, I like your point 👍🏼"

2338,2020-10-30 22:42:55,jl11m4,Is it likely Dallas Goedert plays?

2343,2020-11-01 22:06:59,jl11m4,I think we see a much closer game then many are expecting. This team isn’t blowing anyone out IMO.

2348,2020-11-02 01:39:47,jl11m4,Thank goodness Dallas Cowboys have no faith in that line or their QB because we should be down by 10 rn.
2349,2020-11-02 01:40:44,jl11m4,Imagine if we didnt re-sign graham like everyone talked about. So glad he's still on the team. He's ball hunting so well this season.
2350,2020-10-30 22:46:19,jl11m4,"People are dreading a Joe Webb repeat, but this feels much more like a Luke Falk situation. The Dallas OL is in shambles, the team is disheartened, and the QB struggled in D1 college programs before having 1 decent year at JMU. I think the D Line for Philadelphia is just going to feast. 8-10 sacks incoming."
2351,2020-10-30 18:08:05,jl11m4,"This game won't be competitive. Y'all don't have to worry, only way it is competitive is if Wentz plays awful but Scott is going to rush for 150 so you'll be fine."

2374,2020-10-31 02:11:22,jl11m4,"I’ve stopped expecting any sort of blowout win for this team at this point. This is going to be a close game where we look worse then we should and they look marginally better then they should. I hope I’m wrong, but let’s be honest both teams are an absolute mess.

Guessing DiNucci has a really good game (for a late round rookie), guessing 12 of 20 for around 225 yards and 2 tds, no INTS. Then when Dalton goes down again and he is against any other team he is going to look awful. That is just how this rivalry works."
2375,2020-10-31 15:35:40,jl11m4,I'm taking the subway down tomorrow with my cousin. What time should we leave from center city? Like 7? I don't really know what there is to do pregame since there's no tailgating.

2378,2020-11-01 12:24:53,jl11m4,"If eagles pull this win off tonight does anyone else feel really good about the rest of the season? They’ll have a bye week to get even healthier and even while banged up they’ve been putting up fights against very good teams. 

They’d have a commanding division lead with 3 wins (lol) and get to play giants then browns out of the buy. I think this could be the start of the run."

2418,2020-11-01 16:00:13,jl11m4,"What’s up, I’m an Arsenal supporter as well. I think it’s a bit different because a lot of Premier League fans in America starting following before their city had an MLS team. With American teams, it means you’re a actively choosing to root for a team from another city over yours. Isn’t the whole point to root for and have pride in the place you call home? Seems more fulfilling to me than choosing a team for shiny helmets or a color shade you like. COYG."

2463,2020-10-30 18:22:48,jl11m4,"At the end of the day I just hope no one on other team gets injured, the whole league has seen enough of major injuries. Nfc east games always seem to be a shit show but I have never seen Dallas play as bad as they have"
2464,2020-10-30 19:25:32,jl11m4,We’re very good at playing down to shit opponents
2465,2020-10-31 14:22:44,jl11m4,"Was relatively local as a kid and such, but feel like this is a really dumb take in the internet era where you can be attached to a team the same way a local is in all phases except for being able to attend the games.

Everyone has to start somewhere."

2467,2020-11-01 16:13:21,jl11m4,All good. I have message them on it. It occurs if there is a blank in the left column and the right column is filled in. It's weird cause it doesn't always occur

2471,2020-10-31 14:25:42,jl11m4,"Picking a team and becoming loyal would be under “another good reason”. I’m talking about generations of Lakers, Cowboys, and Yankees fans who exist simply because either they or their parents started liking them due to success. I have no problem with picking a team and liking them, just depends on the reason why.

And you being relatively local at any point contributes. I’m simply talking about fans with absolutely no relations to team besides success."
2472,2020-10-31 15:01:39,jl11m4,"Do you know how many times Eagles fans have heard “5 Rings” or “No superbowls” before 2017? Just because they or their family may have started liking them due to their success. I’m all for the fans that were there from the beginning, but not bandwagoners. I respect fandoms, but not always the roots of them."
2473,2020-11-02 00:21:48,jl11m4,I mean like that’s still pretty heroic on the progression scale if you ask me

2477,2020-10-21 21:39:48,jffsfp,"Who in the NFL do you think Fulgham compares to? My friend who hadn't watched him play asked me who this guy was and asked who he played like. The first guy I could think of was Kenny Golloday. Unheralded guy who doesn't do any one thing superlatively, doesn't exactly jump off the tape, but simply gets open and makes plays again and again. 

Who do y'all think our lord and savior plays like?"
2478,2020-10-21 16:51:20,jffsfp,so what’s up with y’all’s strength and conditioning staff? this seemingly happens all the time with you guys
2479,2020-10-21 17:42:02,jffsfp,Would love to see the Eagles roll out a bunch of 2 QB plays again this week.
2480,2020-10-21 17:26:56,jffsfp,Do the Giants fans even know who J.J. Arcega-Whiteside is? cause he's about to destroy their team...
2481,2020-10-22 03:05:53,jffsfp,Following Obama’s speech The Eagles will go 3-0 these next three games
2482,2020-10-21 22:34:39,jffsfp,"As a Giants fan, I want to apologize for how unnecessarily shitty a lot of these comments have been. And thanks, OP for inviting the conversation over to our sub. 

I hope my Giants win, but this should be one of the more interesting games of the season (in the NFCE). With both of our offenses lacking it should come down to the wire, I'm expecting a Giants loss because you guys have had our number for years. 

That being said, I don't think DJ or Wentz will have a particularly good game through the air. Seems like this one will come down to whose o/d-lines plays hardest to protect / limit the run game. Feel free to @ me if you guys embarrass us or vice versa lol. 

What are the Eagles fans thoughts on this matchup?"
2483,2020-10-22 16:00:57,jffsfp,All I wanna see is a Hurts to Wentz to Desean for an 80 yd TD completion
2484,2020-10-21 16:44:28,jffsfp,Quality information
2485,2020-10-21 16:13:31,jffsfp,Giants fan here. What's the word on Jackson/Jeffery/Johnson playing tomorrow?
2486,2020-10-21 16:29:26,jffsfp,"Also, the Giant's secondary isn't quite as bad as you'd think. They are middle of the pack in passing ypg and ypa, and 7th in yds per completion and they really haven't allowed many big plays so far. They don't have strong edge rushers, but find a way to manufacture decent pressure. They are top 10 in sacks and QB hits. So pass defense maybe isn't a strength, but definitely not a glaring weakness like the past few years.

With that said, getting off the field on 3rd down has been an issue and I expect that to continue."
2487,2020-10-21 17:49:43,jffsfp,How has Hurts looked in his time on the field?
2488,2020-10-21 20:22:21,jffsfp,Is that a roster list or an injury report
2489,2020-10-22 18:03:19,jffsfp,I have a real worry that Jones is going to pick apart gym shorts defense like Haskins did. This defense is weak and poorly schemed. For some reason gym doesn’t plan well for games they should win.
2490,2020-10-21 17:08:57,jffsfp,"Eagles fans, how’s the running game been for y’all so far? I’m still having Boston Scott nightmares from week 17"
2491,2020-10-22 03:21:08,jffsfp,Ok I'm a Giants fan and many of us want to tank because we see no hope this season. Obviously both teams pretty much suck this year. Does your fan base want to win the NFC least or do you guys want the best pick possible?
2492,2020-10-22 11:57:01,jffsfp,This is the first game in a while that I’ve come in feeling very confident we’ll win. Please don’t let me down
2493,2020-10-22 14:54:13,jffsfp,I know that the division is garbage and this game could go either way but am I wrong to put stock in what we’ve been able to do on offense to the Steelers and Ravens D these past few weeks? It makes me optimistic we stand a pretty good chance against the Giants D
2494,2020-10-22 21:47:19,jffsfp,$150 on a Fulgham TD on Bradberry! Let’s get it!
2495,2020-10-22 23:10:02,jffsfp,Do we get to see Boston Scott torch the giants again or do we see another lame game plan from Doug?
2496,2020-10-22 18:35:34,jffsfp,I want this to be the Jalen Hurts game. Especially in the first half where they’ve struggled. Get him 10-12 snaps tonight and continue to do the creative stuff they’ve been doing. They’ve actually done some really nice stuff with him outside of those fumbles. He helped spring the Sanders run last week. This also helps protect Wentz from taking the hits we’ve seen him take.
2497,2020-10-22 22:53:44,jffsfp,Why can't they have this game at 7 pm like the covid game the other day? I loved that shit.

2499,2020-10-21 17:15:55,jffsfp,"Giants fan, not sure our oline is that bad they've been improving each week and have okay stats for pressure considering we are the most blitzed team in the NFL last I checked. Doesn't really matter because Garrett's offense only goal is to get 10 yds every 3 downs"
2500,2020-10-21 20:23:37,jffsfp,"Question for eagles fans, I always thought Wentz is such an amazing QB. Do you guys really think hes not playing good or is the line and recievers failing him?"

I know they’re all most likely out against ny"

2503,2020-10-22 03:20:41,jffsfp,"Giants fan here. Personally, I’m thinking this game is gonna come down to turnovers. Daniel jones has been a turnover machine, he’s always been good for one a game at least. Wentz this year has thrown the most INTS in the league this season and has also had the most turnover worthy plays this year. Whichever team turns the ball over the least wins this game in my mind."

2512,2020-10-22 22:11:46,jffsfp,"We need a win tonight. We'll start some momentum and destroy the Cowboys with it. We just need to make sure our O line actually blocks, we need to get a early lead and run it down their throats. If our corners don't get burnt, I think we could win by 2 TDs or more."
2513,2020-10-22 23:27:19,jffsfp,Is Desean playing? I know he was FP on the last day of practice.
2514,2020-10-22 23:40:35,jffsfp,I feel it in my plums that Richard Rodger has 2 touchdowns tonight.

The birds have to be smart on ST tonight ."
2521,2020-10-21 17:27:16,jffsfp,Are Philly fans calling for a full on switch at QB? I obviously don't follow the team much because their colors and logo and fanbase etc are just awful but am curious to know where people stand. The first two or three years of Wentz's career had me shaking in my boots thinking we were going to be the new AFC EAST with Wentz dominating a la Brady.
2522,2020-10-21 23:14:05,jffsfp,"This game will be a LOT closer than ppl realize. Eagles-Giants games are always competitive regardless how bad they are. The only time we had a comfortable win against them over the last 3 years I’d say the 2018 TNF game. (Sure you could argue the 2019 finale but even then, that was close until the Daniel Jones fumble gave us the momentum swing to win in the fourth). It took us comebacks to beat them at home over the last two years. I’d say we beat them 20-17. It’ll be close. Defense will let the giants get big plays here n there but our offense will seal the victory plus we have several key players returning too."
2523,2020-10-21 17:35:03,jffsfp,"As a giants fan, I apologize. Pizza yes, cheesesteak not even close."
2524,2020-10-22 00:57:07,jffsfp,"As someone who lives there that just isn’t correct, there are some good ones but Philly can’t be beat"

2526,2020-10-22 05:20:56,jffsfp,Lol that had nothing to do with being a Giants fan that's just stupid. As a Giants fan I will admit that Philly has the best Cheese steaks

2530,2020-10-22 08:44:15,jffsfp,"Isnt he really slow? Like 4.65? I think that was why he was undrafted. So someone slow but good hands, maybe Dez Bryant"
2531,2020-10-22 10:02:45,jffsfp,Michael Thomas / Allen Robinson
2532,2020-10-22 01:34:37,jffsfp,I think he's a good mix of Golladay and Michael Thomas.
2533,2020-10-22 13:34:55,jffsfp,Fitzgerald all the way. Called my dad during the middle of the Steelers game when he went up and over a dude and just ripped it away

2537,2020-10-22 12:46:12,jffsfp,"If you do any research this is myth. You can find a true answer in no more than 5 minutes. Two bad years, yes. Bad since 2016, no."
2538,2020-10-21 22:50:11,jffsfp,"I think they will, especially with Sanders out"
2539,2020-10-22 16:05:47,jffsfp,"Seriously, every time Hurts comes on the field the defense suddenly has ten extra variables they have to work out."
2540,2020-10-21 18:22:00,jffsfp,Giants fan here who was upset JJAW ended up in Philly after falling in love with him during Pac 12 after dark games

2542,2020-10-22 05:03:45,jffsfp,I think it will be an entertaining game. Don't know who wins
2543,2020-10-21 16:15:20,jffsfp,"Jackson, and johnson in, Jeffery out."
2544,2020-10-22 04:58:22,jffsfp,jackson in for 7 snaps before exploding
2545,2020-10-21 16:15:35,jffsfp,"Jeffrey is most likely out, and is a longshot to play and is more likley back next week. Johnson and Jackson are probable to play barring setbacks."
2546,2020-10-21 17:15:19,jffsfp,"It's ridiculous.....they look so good on 1st and 2nd, but it can be 3rd and 10 and I know the opponent will convert.  It's maddening, especially with how good Bradberry and Martinez have been."
2547,2020-10-22 00:10:11,jffsfp,"Good. Runs big and is hard to bring down. His arm doesn't look half bad either. Big high effort guy like Carson, too which ya love to see"
2548,2020-10-22 05:00:25,jffsfp,"hes fine, but what is more exciting is when Wentz lines up at WR because he will block a receiver into the dirt"
2549,2020-10-21 17:12:38,jffsfp,"With Sanders it has been great, without him not so much, Scott killed you guys last year, but hasn't been very effective this season, neither has Clement. Behind Sanders, Wentz has been our best runner which he has been doing more this season. It will be interesting to see what they can do especially behind the current line that is miss starters possibly 4 if Johnson can't go."
2550,2020-10-22 05:15:35,jffsfp,always win. I think it is a loser mentality to want to lose out for a chance at a high draft player. Not to mention you get at least 1 more week of football before the longest offseason
2551,2020-10-22 04:48:34,jffsfp,"I think most of us always want to win. We have been a decently good to great team way more often than not for the past 20 years and we’ve gotten used it. We also suck at drafting. 

With that said, being sellers at the deadline but winning the division is probably ideal"
2552,2020-10-22 13:29:26,jffsfp,Lol. Cincinnati anyone?
2553,2020-10-22 23:30:24,jffsfp,West coast
2554,2020-10-21 17:00:20,jffsfp,"If Bradberry is on him, he’s not seeing the end zone 🙅🏼‍♂️

I’m actually really looking forward to their matchups. Bradberry has been an all-pro for us this season, and Fulgham seemingly came out of nowhere. My Giants bias tells me he’s just a couple week fling on an injury-devastated team, but bias aside that may not be the case"
2555,2020-10-21 17:05:42,jffsfp,"I’m not 100% certain whether Bradberry will be shadowing Fulgham, but if he is that bet will lose you money. Bradberry is in the argument for best corner in the league this season, he’s completely shut down everyone he’s covered. (If I’m wrong and Bradberry shadows Ward or just plays a side, then your bet would be a great one though)"
2556,2020-10-21 20:31:07,jffsfp,Wentz has played very well last 2 weeks. He definitely struggled first couple of weeks of the season. He also had no WRs really to throw to the first two weeks outside of Raegor is just a rookie. Fulgham seems to have Wentz's confidence and he has looked a lot better since he has emerged. But the dude is carrying the team right now. He had them in a position to win the last two weeks despite the fact against Baltimore the only other starter that wasn't injured besides him was C Jason Kelce. And some positions were on the 3rd and 4th string. Wentz had two passes dropped last week that should have been TDs to Miles Sanders and to John Hightower. Wentz is far from the problem on this football team.
2557,2020-10-22 00:02:43,jffsfp,Goedert and Raegor most likely yes. Sanders most likely no.
2558,2020-10-22 11:07:27,jffsfp,We deserve it. And idk why Joe Buck gets so much hate I think he’s good.
2559,2020-10-22 15:20:10,jffsfp,"Based on the time frame of the anticipated recovery of 1-2 weeks as well as how he went down, knew twisted up from a tackle from behind, I would say with 85% certainty a MCL sprain."
2560,2020-10-22 23:31:05,jffsfp,Oh man
2561,2020-10-22 23:35:41,jffsfp,He and lane are both active tonight. So he is at least dressing.
2562,2020-10-21 17:45:18,jffsfp,"Wentz has been playing much better than the first 3 weeks (11th highest PFF grade among QBs from Weeks 4-6), so not really bench worthy. Plus the Eagles are so depleted offensively that throwing Hurts in on top of that would just be asking for more trouble

At this point the people asking for Wentz to be benched are the people who have never let go of Nick Foles"
2563,2020-10-21 17:53:38,jffsfp,"Literally no one is calling for a switch at QB, unless you are a moron. Wentz played poorly his first two games, but has played extremely well the last two games against the top 2 defesnes in the league with no OL and no WRs with the exception of the emergence of Fulgham who was on our PS, but against Baltimore he finished the game with only one other starter, Jason Kelce and had us in a position to tie the game if not for a terrible playcall by Pederson on the 2 point conversion. He also had us in the Steelers game, but the defense couldn't make a stop and gave up a TD because Jim Schwartz put the worst LB in the league on a guy who had three TDs that day. Wentz isn't close to the problem on our team right now."
2564,2020-10-21 18:28:44,jffsfp,"Remember when we won the Super Bowl with a backup QB, LT, RB3, and several other major injuries? We got spoiled that season (and someone clearly made a deal with Satan, along the lines of: if you help us beat Tom Brady in the Super Bowl, you can take all the ACLs that you want for the next 10 years).

&#x200B;

Like all passionate fans, we clearly know better than the coaches and players, and will loudly scream our very correct, non-emotional opinions into the social media aether.

&#x200B;

Personally, I like Wentz a ton. Our O-Line is Swiss cheese right now (thanks Satan!), but giving Carson a break to let Jalen run for his life a few series a game is okay with me."
2565,2020-10-22 01:00:31,jffsfp,The Giants 4 of last 5 games have come down to the last drive of the game. I'm expecting that trend to continue into this game as well tbh
2566,2020-10-21 17:38:36,jffsfp,Thank you. You and your family will be spared from the carnage
2567,2020-10-21 18:32:07,jffsfp,NY has better wings. At least upstate  (for obvious reasons) where I travel more often.

2569,2020-10-22 01:53:08,jffsfp,Idk. I see an awful lot of Megatron in there. And Calvin Johnson too.
2570,2020-10-22 13:00:02,jffsfp,I agree with the Tyreek Hill. Fulgham's got the speed we need to stretch the field. Gets good separation from his defender and will find himself wide open. It's just about Carson getting enough time in the pocket to be able to drop a dime
2571,2020-10-22 20:30:04,jffsfp,Its FULGOAT
2572,2020-10-22 21:17:37,jffsfp,I’ve been sayin it for the lols

2574,2020-10-21 17:45:04,jffsfp,No we haven't. We've changed the medical staff every year. Those are the guys who deal with the injuries after they happen. Our strength and conditioning staff has been mostly the same since Chip Kelly was the coach
2575,2020-10-22 13:39:39,jffsfp,Two bad years in a row though?

2578,2020-10-22 22:22:26,jffsfp,"Back to back career games, so it checks out"
2579,2020-10-23 00:01:30,jffsfp,7 50+ yd TDs confirmed. I'll take it. Hell of a way to go out.
2580,2020-10-21 17:24:31,jffsfp,"Ahhhh, not stopping a 3rd and long... A Philly delicacy as well."
2581,2020-10-21 18:11:23,jffsfp,We have the EXACT. EXACT same problem. The Ravens converted several 3rd and 10+ after two impressive stops before on the other two downs
2582,2020-10-22 11:05:51,jffsfp,Oh lol I thought you were an Eagles fan at first
2583,2020-10-22 11:05:29,jffsfp,FR someone please make a Wentz blocking highlight.
2584,2020-10-21 17:17:44,jffsfp,"Well as you see above, Jones is our leading rusher so we might see a QB run duel. But our running game has actually been much better as of late with Freeman, not good or great by any means, but average which is better than how putrid it was it in our first 3 games."
2585,2020-10-22 05:19:26,jffsfp,Talk about a strange season
2586,2020-10-22 20:34:44,jffsfp,"Not OP, but I definitely had bad feelings about that Cincy game because of our history playing them. I even joked with my Bengals fan cousin about another tie happening before the game. Something about that damn team in our history, and it doesn't seem to matter how bad they are. Makes no sense."
2587,2020-10-22 23:40:55,jffsfp,"Sure, but these are two east coast teams."
2588,2020-10-22 20:39:47,jffsfp,"I think all of us thought the same about Fulgham after the 9ers, but it's hard to deny or ignore what he's done. Like he just had a  really respectable game against a couple stud corners in Baltimore, and this was after gaining national attention from that huge game against Pittsburgh. I think this guy has solidified a spot as a starter, even when (if) Alshon comes back."
2589,2020-10-21 18:37:40,jffsfp,"I don't think Fulgham is fluke. The guy runs pretty good routes, has good hands and has decent size at 6'2. He has also developed a good relationship with Wentz and Wentz trusts him after making multiple tough contested catches. Dude probably sticks around longer than JJAW."
2590,2020-10-22 00:14:47,jffsfp,Hopefully Boston Scott can play well
2591,2020-10-22 05:07:40,jffsfp,I don't think we have any of them. Goedert was IRed but is more like a 6 week thing and Reagor will probably be the same. I think Reagor comes afte the bye and Goedert comes 2 weeks after
2592,2020-10-22 16:03:50,jffsfp,I'll take him over Collinsworth 10/10 times
2593,2020-10-23 00:15:42,jffsfp,Im scraping the bottom of the barrel here man and just throwing shit darts
2594,2020-10-22 23:45:30,jffsfp,"Cool I’m definitely taking you guys then with the pts, and will probably tease it to 6.5."
2595,2020-10-21 18:06:43,jffsfp,"Makes sense. Wentz is unreal sometimes so you gotta let him find his groove again because this division is a joke and the Eagles IMO have the highest ceiling, unfortunately."
2596,2020-10-22 01:01:10,jffsfp,"Yup. Like I said, every Eagles, Giants games are tough and competitive."
2597,2020-10-22 01:15:44,jffsfp,They better paint a red cheesesteak above their doors
2598,2020-10-21 18:49:48,jffsfp,"Have you had OIP original Italian pizza, their wings are charbroiled and most likely the best I’ve ever eaten."
2599,2020-10-21 23:17:46,jffsfp,Rustica is very solid. I hope its in your 3 places. Also Vetri is AMAZING but expensive so it is the move for special occasions.
2600,2020-10-22 22:51:20,jffsfp,the fact you called north eastern Pennsylvania the pizza capital of the country immediately DQ'd you from ever talking pizza
2601,2020-10-22 14:51:11,jffsfp,Three Bros in Port Richmond is great. As is City View.
2602,2020-10-22 18:26:14,jffsfp,This is an asinine comment
2603,2020-10-22 04:57:48,jffsfp,megatron in his prime was def better but calvin johnson gets the nod for having such a longer career
2604,2020-10-21 18:24:44,jffsfp,"Agreed. Chip Kelly was kind of a mad scientist, which worked a little at the beginning, but his one experiment of conditioning and monitoring players every nanosecond did seem to keep us really healthy. I'd be very happy if the Eagles brought those shakes back, and the staff that created them."
2605,2020-10-21 18:33:34,jffsfp,"They swapped out the Sports Science head who was the same from when Chip was here, but he was let go this year and they brought in a guy from the Rams, but you are correct on Hingst who has been the strength and conditioning coach since 2013."

2607,2020-10-22 00:12:41,jffsfp,How does it feel to have Wentz at QB after letting a super bowl MVP walk?
2608,2020-10-22 14:16:20,jffsfp,"He has as many fumble recovery touchdowns as he has receptions on the season, and his one catch he started celebrating while time ran out in the half for us to kick a FG."
2609,2020-10-22 02:46:00,jffsfp,"Infuriating isn't it?  If I was closer to Philly, I'd bet you a cheese steak that we will have a worse 3rd down conversion percentage tomorrow."
2610,2020-10-22 10:05:10,jffsfp,The Ravens? Try every team we’ve played has converted 3rd and 10+ on us at least 2-3 times a game. Jim Shorts sucks
2611,2020-10-22 23:42:44,jffsfp,They still want people from the west coast to watch
2612,2020-10-22 20:40:29,jffsfp,I hear ya! It’ll be an exciting matchup
2613,2020-10-21 18:43:22,jffsfp,"Yeah I know I totally agree that he could be a stud, just Bradberry has shut down everyone he’s faced, including top receivers like ARob, Amari, Terry, Robert Woods, and I’d say it’s a good bet if he shadows Fulgham it would be the same outcome"
2614,2020-10-22 05:38:41,jffsfp,"Both were given around 4  week time frames. What are you even talking about? And IR doesn't mean shit this season they are already eligible to come off it. Multiple sites predict them back next week.

2619,2020-10-22 06:01:01,jffsfp,Fulgham will never reach Megatrons level but give him a few years and he might be as good as like maybe a Calvin Johnson
2620,2020-10-22 22:12:02,jffsfp,That Rams guy we brought in was the guy whose job it was to shadow mcvay to keep him from entering the field what's he know.
2621,2020-10-22 05:43:22,jffsfp,Bruh Wentz is better than Foles.
2622,2020-10-22 12:25:21,jffsfp,How does it feel to have Jones at QB are letting a super bowl MVP retire?
2623,2020-10-22 19:15:31,jffsfp,Foles would be dead if he had to play in that Baltimore. We did him a favor.
2624,2020-10-22 20:42:42,jffsfp,"Agreed! If Bradberry follows him, I'm just hoping for a similar game to last week. That would be a success for me. Pumped for the game!"
2625,2020-10-21 18:49:28,jffsfp,"Bradberry is a good corner but it isn't like Fulgham has been putting up the stats against bums. The three defenses he faced and put up numbers against are currently ranked 5th, 2nd and 10th in total defense. He was covered by Marcus Peters and Marlon Humphrey at lot last week. And Joe Haden the week before. Should be a good matchup and with Jackson back Bradberry may be forced on him vs Fulgham."
2626,2020-10-22 05:42:34,jffsfp,I doubt that
2627,2020-10-23 00:37:09,jffsfp,I’m in ppr so as long as he has like 4 catches and 40 yards I’ll be happy- TDs are a bonus- I started this dude only one other time in fantasy like 3-4 years ago and the only reason I remember it is because he caught a 70 some yard Hail Mary from Aaron Rodgers for a TD as time expired and got like 16 points for one play lol.
2628,2020-10-22 18:37:52,jffsfp,"Great wings are fried, sauced, and then charbroiled imo.

Dont downvote me please"
2629,2020-10-22 23:38:25,jffsfp,True but have you had charbroiled wings ?
2630,2020-10-22 20:44:02,jffsfp,"Patrick Graham has been switching things up from week to week, which I absolutely love. So, I dunno if we’ll see a true Bradberry lockdown or zone/blended schemes until gametime"
2631,2020-10-22 23:37:56,jffsfp,Never had it like that. Seems interesting lol.
2632,2020-10-23 00:50:36,jffsfp,"Try it sometime.  I learned it working at a restaurant

Next time you make wings at home fry em up and aftee you sauce him throw em on the grille. The flames will caramelize the sauce"
2633,2021-02-04 09:03:59,jf6en9,"Love their sound, too bad they are not a together anymore. Are there any other group like them?"
2634,2021-02-04 16:41:35,jf6en9,"I'm sure there are some similar-sounding groups out there, but I personally haven't heard them. Part of the reason I loved their music so much is because of how unique it was."
2635,2020-10-16 17:14:44,jccn8y,">Gerry has given up 23 receptions on 23 targets for 267 yards 4 TDs and a 154.6 passer rating

How.

I know we're not exactly overflowing with LB talent right now but this guys gotta get off the field permanently. He doesn't even deserve a ST role. Fuck that he shouldn't even be on the practice squad."
2636,2020-10-16 16:29:03,jccn8y,"Since 2018, Ravens are 0-9 when trailing at halftime"
2637,2020-10-16 17:42:50,jccn8y,Anyone starting Travis Fulgham in fantasy?
2638,2020-10-16 16:13:53,jccn8y,"Can’t let Baltimore control the game. Offense has to start quickly, defense needs to have that bend, don’t break ability. 

We dictate the pace. Early points, need a strong lead from the off. Force the ball into Lamar’s hands, make him win this game through the air, try to negate the run game early and make them pass wherever we can. 

That’s how we win the game. Could we do it? Absolutely. Will we do it? To be honest, I don’t think so."
2639,2020-10-16 16:31:43,jccn8y,"I’m super excited for DJax to come back and “reinjure” his hamstring sometime in the first quarter, if he even makes it through warmups"
2640,2020-10-16 18:19:28,jccn8y,"With the play of our LBs, Lamar is going to run for like 100,000 yds... in the first Q."
2641,2020-10-16 18:38:29,jccn8y,"I got married last month to a Ravens fan. So, uh...we'll see how this goes."
2642,2020-10-16 19:29:55,jccn8y,"I know it sounds crazy but as long as we have Carson under center I’ll believe we have a shot at winning against anyone, yeah can be crap but he can also put the team on his back, excited to see what he does Sunday."
2643,2020-10-16 19:42:58,jccn8y,"Ravens will win, the only question is if we can hold them under 50 and if our offense can put up enough points to make it look like the wheels haven’t completely fallen off. It’s not that I think our defense is completely terrible (we are bad) but this is a terrible matchup. We have always struggled against mobile QBs, and once Lamar breaks contain we don’t have LBs to pursue."
2644,2020-10-16 17:39:37,jccn8y,"Everyone is predicting a Baltimore blow out and I have nothing solid to offer to counter that assessment. However, my gut tells me this is going to be a game and we're going to be supprised by the Eagles....and especially the defense who somehow manages to keep Baltimore contained. I can't put my finger on it, but their is something about Baltimore that makes me believe they just aren't sustainable.


This has all the hallmarks of a trap game. Based on nothing but wild hope I say 17-14 Eagles win."
2645,2020-10-16 18:42:13,jccn8y,"Greetings from the ravens sub, I can tell you from the last few games saying what to do against this team is both simple and difficult to execute at the same time. The offense has shown flashes of struggle against teams with solid defensive pressure on Lamar, don't know what his issues are right now but he's having problems turning the corner, hes also been struggling in the pocket. Now that being said everyone knows what he is capable of from last season if he finds that groove. Now the other side of the ball has been this teams bread and butter, several turnovers and limiting offenses, the biggest weakness is inexperience in the middle of the field but again it's hit or miss. KC did a great job exploiting this weakness and using Peters against himself if Wentz can play a clean game and find a way passed this defense the offense has shown it struggles heavily in close games or from behind"
2646,2020-10-16 18:27:50,jccn8y,"I just don't see the Eagles winning this one. Prove me wrong, birds. However, I do see them going on a bit of a winning streak after this week. They got Giants twice and the Cowboys at home. The Giants are downright atrocious this year so I can see the Eagles sweeping them, and the Eagles usually beat the Cowboys at home lately. So, I can likely see them being 4-4-1 by Week 10. Or they will lose out, leaving me in a chronic state of depression all season."
2647,2020-10-17 21:23:04,jccn8y,"I was wondering what the Eagles 1st season looked like and saw that this game almost fell 87 years to the day of the Eagles first game ever. They lost to the Giants 56-0. 

In fact, they were outscored 95-0 before they scored their first points as a franchise in the 3rd game. Swede Hanson caught a TD pass from Red Kirkman. However, they were no match for Green Bay and Buckets Goldenberg and lost 35-9. These names are incredible. Buckets is responsible for the creation of the RB Draw play, btw. Who knew? 

The Franchise's first win? Came against the Cincinnati Reds. The Reds were outscored 38 to 110 in 10 games that year, came back the next year.....And got outscored 10-243 in 8 before folding lmao."
2648,2020-10-16 17:04:56,jccn8y,what's the updated injury list? what are Avonte and Alshons chances?

2652,2020-10-16 20:19:40,jccn8y,You have some of their probowlers listed as on our team. You also left Lamar off of their leading rusher table
2653,2020-10-16 23:40:04,jccn8y,We're gonna get slaughtered.
2654,2020-10-17 03:42:21,jccn8y,Lane and Pryor are out for this one.  That does not bide well.
2655,2020-10-17 05:26:24,jccn8y,Who’s covering Fulgham?
2656,2020-10-17 05:49:41,jccn8y,We are gonna get fucking killed
2657,2020-10-17 15:16:25,jccn8y,It just crossed my mind that if the Cowboys finish in the bottom 10 and get a high draft pick they could move up to draft Trevor Lawrence and not have to pay a quarterback for another four or five years and let Dak walk and put all their money into their defense
2658,2020-10-17 16:38:46,jccn8y,"Coaches better be hammering the defensive ends to contain lamar and not let him get the edge. I don’t even care if he still kills them, I just want to see some disciplined play and i’ll be content."
2659,2020-10-17 22:07:50,jccn8y,what if we win tho
2660,2020-10-18 01:49:57,jccn8y,"I feel like saying we will lose implies that is possible that we will win, so what I will say is that I will start drinking now for the next 24hrs"
2661,2020-10-16 21:34:23,jccn8y,We lose by 30

2664,2020-10-16 19:29:19,jccn8y,"Can we just start the entire 2nd team? It’s a loss anyway, so why not injure the lower level guys instead of the starters."
2665,2020-10-16 21:35:00,jccn8y,Off topic but the fact we didn't get robbie Anderson shows how bad our front office is. A position of need but we get djax.
2666,2020-10-16 19:49:08,jccn8y,Parks is back so he will be back to his rightful place on the bench.
2667,2020-10-17 17:21:40,jccn8y,And he’s the defensive player with the helmet radio and an extra whammy.
2668,2020-10-16 17:09:33,jccn8y,"Yeah as a Ravens fan, that's the way to beat them right now. Get as much of a lead as you can and make them play from behind. 

The Ravens passing game has looked pretty rough lately and OC Greg Roman always abandons the run way, way too early when they're trailing. 

The only issue is, it's difficult to get a lead on the Ravens (unless your Mahomes) because the defense has been playing really good."
2669,2020-10-16 18:20:35,jccn8y,5 of those are Flacco’s. Not that it makes it better 😅
2670,2020-10-16 18:06:31,jccn8y,Yep. But only because half my team is on bye.
2671,2020-10-16 19:20:49,jccn8y,"I am, my two usual WR starts are DK and Lockett, Seahawk are on a buy so I am rolling with the best receiver in football"
2672,2020-10-16 18:33:35,jccn8y,I am debating between starting him or Diontae Johnson. Everyone else is on a bye this week.
2673,2020-10-17 04:19:01,jccn8y,"I want to, but I think I’m gonna stick with Devante Parker vs the Jets instead of anyone on our team vs the Ravens lol"

2677,2020-10-17 16:42:01,jccn8y,Defense has been playing more of a bend and break strategy this year.
2678,2020-10-16 19:37:58,jccn8y,He’s out this game. So you’ll have to wait a week to watch him injure himself again.
2679,2020-10-17 01:13:32,jccn8y,"Good news, he’s out"
2680,2020-10-16 18:41:16,jccn8y,Is he for sure playing this Sunday ?
2681,2020-10-17 06:55:54,jccn8y,I (a Ravens fan) married an Eagles fan last year. I expect a bloodbath. The game might even get ugly too.
2682,2020-10-17 08:34:47,jccn8y,"Your point is absolutely crazy,  but it makes sense. 

At this point, I think my best analogy is a personal one with golf. On the golf course, I know my driver can take over and help with scoring for my round. That said, my driver catches a lot of heat for f'ing up lately. But we're not going to panic. My driver is here to stay. 

Yes, I did spend a small fortune on another driver as a backup. But that isn't some sort of message to my current driver. My current driver is the guy. I might mix in my new driver just to check him out and keep the guy involved. But I won't abandon my current driver ever. (he's not listening right now, is he??)"
2683,2020-10-17 16:51:41,jccn8y,"Especially now that he seems like he got his guy in Fulgham. It seems like a lot of Wentzs struggles are mostly mental and he always steps it up when he gets a guy he trusts. 

Like last year how much better he played when he discovered Greg Ward and last week it was like a whole different player when he started hitting Fulgham."
2684,2020-10-17 16:54:51,jccn8y,Hey were supposed to be positive here until the game thread! Then we start talking about firing the whole coaching staff and trading all our starters. The r/eagles way.
2685,2020-10-16 17:58:10,jccn8y,"Win, lose,............. or tie... there is no way we are only giving up 14 points..."
2686,2020-10-16 19:00:16,jccn8y,"I think Lamar is a little banged up, he didn’t have a single designed run last week(even though he scored two on the ground). If we keep him contained and make him jittery and the score close I see a end zone interception and a long drive to win the game. *talks out of ass*"
2687,2020-10-16 21:27:33,jccn8y,I think we lose but it’s a decently close game. I thought the Steelers would blow us out but I was pleasantly surprised by the offense
2688,2020-10-16 23:11:11,jccn8y,I thought this would be a loss before the season even started. With all our injuries? lol no chance but we will all watch anyway.
2689,2020-10-16 17:18:30,jccn8y,Avonte I hear should play. Alshon I hear is only coming to the facility to get retrieve sacks of money with dollar signs on them and snicker as he slinks away.
2690,2020-10-16 17:18:35,jccn8y,"Avante, Desean and Alshon were all limited yesterday and the Lane Johnson missed practice."
2691,2020-10-16 16:23:03,jccn8y,"One part of that scene I don't get is denting up a perfectly good keg. Just use a sand bag, though I get a keg looks cooler, but Kegs aren't that heavy if they aren't full, which I don't think you should do that with a full keg."
2692,2020-10-16 20:45:05,jccn8y,"Lamar was due to me messing something up and then reventing back in the google doc, I had his stats, but still had connor listed from last week. AS for the Pro Bowlers, I assume you are on mobile because that is an issue with mobile not being able to read a blank cell. Shows up fine on desktop"
2693,2020-10-17 03:56:02,jccn8y,Jason Brown is an upgrade to Pryor. And Driskoll has actually impressed and isn't a huge dropoff to A hobbled Lane.
2694,2020-10-17 06:59:06,jccn8y,Where does he line up?

Ravens have fewest pass attempts of 26 NFL teams to have played 5 games this season (28 passes per game)

You also have 16/26 teams that average at least 35 passes per game

The Ravens have played some iffy teams this year and got absolutely embarrassed by the Chiefs. If they can't get their passing offense looking better then it has, they're going to have major problems against the more competent teams.

2741,2020-10-12 00:27:28,j9gcgi,"Well basically it was because Elliot Rodger thought he was too unattractive to attract a partner the ""usual"" way, so he had to rely on the lottery to actually have a chance, since he believed he started out with a huge handicap. Him ""convincing"" himself he was destined, was probably a coping mechanism so that he wouldn't lose all hope.

He actually spilled it out on this paragraph underneath in page 119.

**PAGE 119:**

I got extremely jealous when I saw that girls were checking Addison out instead of me. This one girl at a restaurant in Santa Monica was staring at him the whole time we were sitting there. No girl had ever done that to me. **This only made me more aware that girls did not consider me physically attractive. My hatred of the female gender could grow no stronger. It was too much.**

Notice Elliot said ""MORE AWARE"" not ""MADE ME AWARE"", so even before this, he had that mentality, hence how he convinced himself that lottery was his salvation."
2742,2020-10-12 22:15:39,j9gcgi,"Not to mention the odds of winning the lottery are so unfathomably low you'd have a better chance of being attacked by a shark or struck by lightning. There's places online where you can run a simulator of buying a few tickets every week for decades and even in my fake reality with unlimited attempts I never cracked more than $10,000."

If you gonna cancel Pratt then we might as well cancel The Undertaker then, who worse with his Blue Lives Matter flags hanging in his living room.

As far I know, people on Twitter are just ragging on Pratt. And folks on Twitter can be..rough. So much so that Downey and Ruffalo had to defend Pratt.

It feels like whoever wrote this just picked a random actor and Elliot Page just happens to be the most popular on Google right now (because, like I said, he came out less than two weeks ago.)

It'd be interesting thought because he played Kitty Pryde and Kitty was one of Peter's love interests. There's some irony in that, maybe? Not enough to justify having him play Star Lord but still kinda funny

Also, whoever wrote the petition accidentally used ""her"" and forgot to capitalize Star Lord, so I'm gonna go out on a limb and say a kid wrote this not really knowing anything about Page besides his recent work on Umbrella Academy"

2789,2020-12-15 10:09:04,kdfeyq,That means it was never necessary to establish and all of the above still apply.
2790,2021-02-21 12:16:03,kdfeyq,"A. HN-LA is just a shadow that we've known for a relatively short time. I doubt she has all of Helenas memories, or at least access to them all right now.  
B. There is a whole second DLC with HN-LA, how do we know she wont mention it there?"
2791,2021-02-21 18:42:45,kdfeyq,"Mate, of course she'd have a damn mother, I'm not fucking retarded you know."
2792,2021-04-30 21:22:54,kdfeyq,"There is also a dense lore that I have delved why to far into, yet Wildcard just wants to pull a Netflix for NO REASON, I really don't like that, especially because they are running over the foot of an already established character who literally has no reason to be queer.  Either way, It's fine that you are oblivious to the Skyrim Scale lore this Indie Game has, but lets all agree that making a character for no reason other than to tick a box off on a checklist, is MORE homophobic than just keeping Helena as this strong female character that is philosophically on the same level as Jesus... okay?"
2793,2020-12-15 19:28:50,kdfeyq,"It's fine, but if Wildcard can add a character out of the blue with no context, why can't we do it too, that's why I'll be opening a petition to get Lombardo Boyar to voice a character in season 2."
2794,2020-12-15 10:16:03,kdfeyq,"_Maybe_ now that her story isn't limited to some vague explorer notes and she gets a whole ass series about her life, details like this become a bit more relevant."
2795,2021-02-21 18:43:52,kdfeyq,That's probably the only good fucking point you've spat at me for this entire session.
2796,2021-02-21 12:19:10,kdfeyq,"Look at the cast, there is more than just Victoria added as a character. Hell, it looks like they added people ON THE ISLAND that will play a role that was never mentioned in the Notes.  


"" Senator Lucius Cassius Virilis, a manipulative aristocrat during the reign of Caesar Augustus.""  


Is THIS character lore breaking? Will you complain about him?"
2797,2020-12-15 10:45:14,kdfeyq,"You’d think something about her sexuality or her literal wife would be mentioned in the explorer notes if it was important. which really aren’t super vague at all. 

It’s just an insulting move on wildcards part to randomly make the main character gay just to be able to scream “LOOK GAY PEOPLE, WE CARE ABOUT YOU. COME BUY OUR PRODUCTS” too many companies do it and too many people fall for the shit."
2798,2021-02-21 18:38:58,kdfeyq,"No, I'd probably not, I don't think the main four would encounter them much, and when they do, in the notes they always referred to a whole tribe, not the individuals within them."
2799,2020-12-15 11:18:58,kdfeyq,"> to be able to scream “LOOK GAY PEOPLE, WE CARE ABOUT YOU. COME BUY OUR PRODUCTS”

They've hardly mentioned it at all. Most people don't even seem to know she's gay. If the mere existence of gay characters in the show is the problem, then there isn't much I can say"
2800,2020-12-15 13:58:14,kdfeyq,"Honestly I think we still need independent female characters just as much or more than homosexual ones and think it’s kind of tragic that at most every opportunity any female that could be independent is generally transformed into a homosexual.

For me the disappointment stems from that she’s not Helena herself, and that they felt like Helena needed a spouse at all. Not that she’s gay, which may or may not play into the series at all and ultimately doesn’t matter. Even if she was her own non-Helena related character I would be okay with it. But making Helena homosexual does destroy part of how I viewed her character.

And yeah I’m probably exaggerating a bit. I hardly keep up with it but it seems like any time I see a female character that doesn’t swoon for a man someone is right there trying to label her a lesbian, even more so if she’s white. In this day and age I think it’s far more problematic for female characters to continue to be defined by their relationships than it is for a minority to get represented to tick off a box on an inclusivity checklist. Especially if there is a noticeable trend of adding it to a specific racial background over others. At that point there’s just something ... wrong ... with the entire practice. It usually ends up an added trait of no consequence than that’s how the character was created and it matters to the story. Like in life a characters sexuality should be no ones business unless it has direct importance and impact on the story."
2801,2020-12-15 14:23:54,kdfeyq,"Alright, that's fair. They did pretty much that in the legend of Korra. But I think OP's post about how it ""killed the character"" was a huge overreaction and that's what my original comment was about"
2802,2020-12-15 15:23:05,kdfeyq,"If it’s a character you strongly identify with or really like because you viewed her specifically that way, this decision really does kill and obliterate that version of the character that they loved so much. That doesn’t mean the new version is or will be awful, but anything replacing a beloved version is going to face dislike and heavy scrutiny. 

Creatively I don’t think it should necessarily have been made obvious in Ark but at the same time it’s now impossible to determine if she was always meant to be or if they are just pandering. And given how haphazardly Ark was designed and released it’s really hard not to view it as the latter. The lack of details left it open to it, but in the setting viewing her as independent follows more naturally than a dispassionate homosexual who never once mentions anything about even having a significant other. No “I wish Vic had seen this.” Or “I miss ..” just nothing. Like she didn’t care. That doesn’t feel like a positive depiction to me. Which is kind of fair in its own right because I’m sure there is someone like that but I’m not really sure how I feel about or if the world is really ready for depictions of somewhat to completely dysfunctional homosexual relationships. But at this point I fully expect Victoria? To see some explorer notes and realize she wasn’t mentioned in any of them. In fact it seems necessary and vital to the character and lore."
2803,2020-12-15 17:26:15,kdfeyq,"The thing is, Vic might not even be on the island, just in flashbacks, which just makes it more fucked up."
2804,2021-02-21 12:13:43,kdfeyq,"Thing is, they also mention her mother. I doubt either of these characters will appear ON the island. More likely, we will see glimpses into her past through flash backs. Which will most definitely happen, since the show will follow Helena.  


I dont see how telling us Helena is gay is the writers fault even. Like, maybe thats on you for projecting your own sexuality on the character."
2805,2021-02-21 14:16:42,kdfeyq,"A straight male advocating against making every female character who seems independent into a homosexual is projecting his sexuality onto her? I don’t want Helena to like guys, I would prefer she be romantically disinclined. I would still hate it if Victoria had been Viktor. So step the fuck down from your holier than thou pulpit. You want to sell me on this? Care enough about the characters to find anything in the lore to build to it, which at this point I think Genesis has introduced. Something I found in a let’s play shortly after posting. Otherwise fuck off, you obviously only care about a real life socio political issue and not the game or the character or anything I can respect. At least if you did that, while I might disagree, I would respect your passion for the material. Instead it seems your passion is homosexuality itself. Which is fine in it’s own right, if you acted passionate about that instead of trying to witch hunt and condemn me for not thinking it’s the greatest thing to happen to a character. Nothing wrong with gay characters, diversity is good, retconning characters just reeks of tokenism, which is really just a way of looking down on people. Throw the dog a bone. Polly want a cracker? Maybe you don’t see it that way but when shit like this happens and you pop out of the wood work months afterwards, all I think is yep, Polly wanted a cracker. Are you truly that hard up for representation that standing by shit that can be interpreted that way is worth it, because I know I’m not alone in viewing it that way. If so that’s really, really sad."

If it is generally publicly known they are trans (since they're a celeb and maybe they came out publicly at some point), and you are needing to tell someone the exact credit they should look for at the end of some old movie, then I suppose it would make sense to say like ""Elliot Page is in that movie, but when you look for him in the credits he'll be listed there as this other name."" But I don't really see this every happening really unless people you know have some sort of extreme special interest in just watching film credits lol."

2845,2020-12-15 00:57:05,kdamdu,Imbd is not a paragon of good practices for trans and non-binary individuals in media. I believe it used to be imbd's policy to not change credits even after individuals changed their name after coming out. I think they are a little better now but obviously not the best.
2846,2020-12-15 00:56:06,kdamdu,"For movies and celebrities and stuff, if they've used a pseudonym they can be credited like, ""Character played by John Smith (as Jane Smith)"" or whatever, to show that they were under a different name at the time.  Definitely don't do that for people you know IRL though because there's no need to tell people a trans person's deadname.  Your example is pretty much just a celebrity thing.  I'm not sure if Elliot gave permission for that because I don't know him"
2847,2020-12-15 01:00:56,kdamdu,"The convention for crediting actors after a name change (after marriage or dropping a stage name) has been to credit their current name and parenthesis their old. I think that convention may shift for trans actors, since the old name can have a much more potent and negative association. Since there are a only a handful of known, out, trans actors though, it might take some time. I dont know if IMDb contacted Elliot, but it seems more likely that someone just edited his associated pages following the old convention."
2848,2020-12-15 06:38:29,kdamdu,"Probably not.  I think they just mean to say that that was the role they had but in the film they were credited differently than they would be currently.

She talked about how she thought she was trans for her twenties and into her thirties but she discovered that she wasn’t trans and was actually lesbian. She had her breasts removed in her transition and needed to get implants. She actually ended up being my favorite artist the school brought in. I felt most were pretentious or niche or politically motivated, but she was just interested in photographing people authentically.

Point being, she was forty and was convinced of being trans for a long time."
2852,2020-12-14 23:33:54,kd8au0,"If a person can be a lesbian on Monday, and a straight man on Tuesday, the entire concept of concept of gender is absurd.

Ironically, even though trans people are very clearly invested in traditional concepts of gender, their agenda is also working overtime to deconstruct it.

This seems self-defeating until you see it in the larger postmodern context: the idea that biology, and physical reality in general, isn't real, and everything is socially constructed. 

Why would someone embrace this worldview? Well, if everything is socially constructed, then all inequalities are the result of imbalanced social power structures. People with ""more"" are evil oppressors, and people with less are helpless victims. 

You'll notice this theme running through pretty much everything in progressive politics today. It's ahistorical, scientifically illiterate, and condescending. But quite popular nonetheless, for a few interrelated reasons. It relases its adherents from having to:

* take blame for their own relative success. It's not their fault--they aren't evil oppressors, after all!--it's ""the system's"" fault. The system can take (most of) the blame; all they have to do is forswear it. This is morally cowardly, but appealing to moral cowards.

* take blame for their own relative *failures*. It's not their fault--it's ""the system"" holding them down! The system can take (most of) the blame; all they have to do is forswear it. This is morally cowardly, but appealing to moral cowards.

* make independent value judgements about themselves or others, and defend them if questioned. All the relevant judgements are pre-made, they just have to repeat them. This is intellectually lazy, but appeals to the intellectually lazy--*especially* to the intellectually lazy who fancy themselves intellectuals.

Basically, whether you're rich or poor, comfortable or ""oppressed"", there's no responsibility to be shouldered. It's not your fault, and there's nothing that you--independently--can do about it. The only thing you need to do (because it's the only thing that *can* be done) is to convince everyone else that everything about society is broken and needs to be dismantled, all at once, and rebuilt in some vaguely specified but deeply felt way that's more ""fair"".

Got it? The solution for *your* personal guilt and/or frustration is for *literally everyone else in the world* to change.

And one consequence of all that is that people think they can not only choose custom pronouns for themselves, but change them on a whim. This part of the project is the deconstruction of language. Pronouns are specifically designed to be generic--i.e., *not* customized. They exist to make the speaker's job easier, not to make the object of the speech feel more special. 

And here we are."

No, you don't.

Before I continue, I'm going to tell you what ""sex"" is defined as, because precisely zero people get this correct. An organism's biological sex is *literally defined in the field of biology* by what kinds of gametes you produce(d). Male-indicating gametes are small, female-indicating gametes are huge by comparison, and hermaphrodites produce both.

Now here's why you don't use pronouns ""in reference to people's biological sex."" Literally nobody asks to see evidence of which gametes the person you're talking to produces. You instead use *secondary sex characteristics* to make an *educated guess* about the person's sex. The perception you have based on the person's secondary sex characteristics is the concept known as ""gender.""

You make an assumption based on how the person looks in order to simplify things, and that determines the pronouns you use.

&#x200B;

""I don't think a 10-year-old should be making decisions on what sex they're gonna be 10 years from now.""

They're not. Sex and gender are not the same thing. Sex is fixed, gender is not. Blaire White looks, acts, and sounds like a woman. Calling her by male pronouns feels cringey and forced. But she is biologically a male and will always be."

Webster defines gender as: a subclass within a grammatical class (such as noun, pronoun, adjective, or verb) of a language that is partly arbitrary but also partly based on distinguishable characteristics (such as shape, social rank, manner of existence, or sex) and that determines agreement with and selection of other words or grammatical forms.

I did not decide this. Lots of people have. Biological sex is part of determining what gendered pronouns to use, but is not the only one. Why are these definitions so difficult for people to understand?

Because the ""system"" as you know it only exists because of a radical rejection of people exhibiting characteristics associated with the sex that isn't theirs, let alone embracing it. 

As far as I'm concerned, gender identity disorder is functionally equivalent to a mental illness. Also as far as I'm concerned, the rejection of someone's suffering because you choose to not accept the reality of their mental illness is ignorant, selfish, and harmful (which, as someone who has battled depression since middle school, I have dealt with from people who are supposed to help me and understand me nearly my whole life.)

Us [neurotic types](https://imgur.com/a/Wpyxb) are still fighting the goddamned system. There are still people who think mental illnesses are a ""mindset"" or some such nonsense.

Why won't you interact with my other point? In what sense is it ""an abstraction"", and what about it being an abstraction makes it an invalid argument? The point is we very often apply gendered pronouns to things with no biologies, hence pronouns don't derive from biology. It's a simple argument. Here's other examples of things that are given gendered pronouns but have no biology: ships, countries, deities, fictional characters (including cartoon characters), abstract objects (through personification) (""We are not to tell Nature what she's got to be."" -R.P. Feynman), etc. The example of cartoon characters is rather illustrative (no pun intended) given that they clearly represent characters we are supposed to associate with men and women or boys and girls, yet have only the outward appearances or behaviors of these categories. Hence, gender pronouns are assigned based on outward features, not biology. 

This latter point is made very obvious by, for instance, what we are inclined to call transwomen (whom we do not yet know to be transwomen) successfully passing as female. ""Passing"" is defined by this quality, namely, that the general person naturally uses the transperson's desired pronouns, merely based on appearances. This alone shows that in everyday usage, pronouns don't refer to biology (hint: biology is not accessible to you when you meet someone on the street, beyond secondary sex characteristics. You can't genotype or inspect the genitals of moist people, yet you aren't in doubt what pronouns to use, and are right almost all the time nevertheless)."
2897,2020-12-15 11:26:30,kd8au0,"Quantum mechanics has been ""in play"" since the Big Bang, and yet humans only knew about it since around the early 1900s. Prior to then, light was taken to be continuous rather than discrete. We now know light is in fact discrete, coming in ""lumps"" called photons. Thus, before then, ""light"" didn't refer to photons: no one who used the word ""light"" meant ""photons"". As most people don't even know what photons are (some say even physicists don't really know what they are), in common usage, light still doesn't refer to photons, and anyone making the opposite claim would then be wrong. Hopefully you see how this applies to pronouns and biological sex. 

(Small children use pronouns correctly, yet are (thankfully) oblivious to the concept of biological sex. Hence, they are not referring to biological sex when using pronouns)

Minnie Mouse HAS NO BIOLOGICAL SEX. She has no biology whatsoever. She has no chromosomes, no genitals, no hormones or anything. She's a cartoon character. Yet, we call her a she and are not incorrect in doing so. You get it almost right: ""The outward appearance is all one needs to determine the"" gender.

>Hence, gender pronouns are assigned based on outward features, not biology. 

Technically yes, but outward features until very recently depended on biology. It's all connected, and deep in our brains.

>what we are inclined to call transwomen (whom we do not yet know to be transwomen) successfully passing as female. 

I agree to a point. It is just appearance, a social construct, *but* constructed in the likeness of biology. What else is hormone-induced breast growth if not an artificial way to cheat a natural system to make you look like, dare I say, a natural woman? A biological woman? Because that's a way we can understand ""successfully passing as a female"". The fact that an imitation can fool someone doesn't mean the original thing is not what it is. That would be a tautology. 

So I agree that some things like longer hair, nails, and clothes are strictly cultural constructs. And appearance is context-based. But many features are rooted in biology - height, bone structure, leg-to-body ratio, waist-to-arms ratio, body hair, voice... All of that is hard-coded, here to stay for as long as we have meat bodies. And we will associate them with biological sex, and they will continue to shape our idea of what it means to be of female or male gender. You can't just take expressions of this identity and say, well, it's all fake."

In linguistics, grammatical gender is a specific form of noun class system in which the division of noun classes forms an agreement system with another aspect of the language, such as adjectives, articles, pronouns, or verbs. Whereas some authors use the term ""grammatical gender"" as a synonym of ""noun class"", others use different definitions for each; many authors prefer ""noun classes"" when none of the inflections in a language relate to sex. Gender system is used in approximately one quarter of the world's languages. In these languages, most or all nouns inherently carry one value of the grammatical category called gender; the values present in a given language (of which there are usually two or three) are called the genders of that language.

2912,2020-12-16 15:25:52,kd8au0,"The same old tired rhetoric of persecution. Nothing I wrote indicates that I do not ""acknowledge"" trans-sexuals. We are discussing them in a general way.  But I understand that you are implying the usual BS:""If you question any aspect of the trans-sexual liberation movement you deny the existence of trans-sexuals.""  Or more precisely, by referring to biological reality and insisting that a man can never really become a woman in actual fact, you ""deny the existence of trans-sexuals.""  Of course they exist.  It is just impossible to change sexes completely.  You can enhance the secondary sex characteristics of your opposite sex with surgery and hormone replacement, but that's as far as it goes.  It is not my fault if these facts existentially threaten someone who attempts to change sex.

You're right about my not caring.  If I encounter what is apparently a woman from all surface appearances, I will assume that the entity is female until I learn otherwise.  Hence, I will refer to the entity with female pronouns when necessary until he or she tells me how he or she wants to be addressed.  I have no problem with being polite to strangers."

2922,2020-12-15 12:43:38,kd8au0,"In modern usage ""fox"" doesn't distinguish between male and female foxes. (Male foxes are sometimes called dogs/tods/reynards, females being called vixens). What was your point with this?

Even unnamed, or without female names, ships are often referred to as female. For example, the Pequod in Moby Dick is referred to as a she, even though no character is thinking of the ship as some sort of woman-analog. Speaking of which , the sea herself us often referred to as female, as are rivers and mountains and other geographic features. Why? Germans (formerly?) referred to their country as a fatherland, whereas Russians more typically referred to their country as as a mother. Why? One obvious reason is based on certain things the country did or was thought to do. Nurturing, protecting, providing, etc. That is, the countries ""behaved"" in a certain way. Ships and oceans likewise. That is, these things have appearances or ""behaviors"" that are taken to correspond to their ascribed genders. (I.e. appearance and behavior are how we assign pronouns, not biology)

You say it ""proves your point"". How does it do that? What is your point and how does the example prove it?

""And God made man in His image"": Why is ""His"" used in this sentence? Is it only anthropomorphism? Thousands of theologians would disagree with you.

Minnie certainly looks like and performs actions typical of typical women. Her voice is higher pitched even than Mickey's. She has longer eyelashes and wears dresses and bows in her ""hair""(?), all being typically female behaviors, in modern Western culture. Yet, she has no biology. This is precisely my point: we judge her to be a ""she"" based on appearances and behaviors, not on biology. 

Goddamn autocorrect. Maybe it's programmed by 16 year olds lol.

The following is technically unrelated but you and others make this mistake often so I'll clarify:

I don't need to argue that the behaviors and appearances have no relationship to biology. They clearly do. Certain genotypes have certain *typical* phenotypes which we are inclined to call ""female"" (e.g. narrower waist/wider hips, larger breasts, less facial hair, etc). But these themselves are things that can potentially apply to an arbitrary interior biology, as *proven* by transfolk. They *correlate* with biology, no doubt, but they are not *perfectly correlated* with biology. As such, they are rough and ready ways to guess at biology which are accurate most of the time, but can nevertheless be inaccurate. 

It's like judging someone's wealth by the car they drive. Some rich people drive junkers, some poorer people have ferraris (maybe inherited, or as gifts, or maybe they saved up, or maybe it's stolen). It's a pretty good way to *guess* at something, and that guess is right *most of* the time, but *sometimes* it's not right, which proves that wealth is not strictly tied to what car someone drives."

Even if someone is androgynous, we have an internal, mental hierarchy of secondary sexual characteristics that are most strongly correlated with each sex, so even if someone exhibits traits of both sexes we will almost always put them into one category or the other.

This is not how we speak about fictional characters and is based on a worthless philosophy thereof. Everyone knows what I mean when I say Jerry from Tom and Jerry is a mouse. They don't think I must be referring to a physically existing mouse somewhere in the world that shares an evolutionary history with your pet gerbil. There are cartoon mice: that is not a contradiction in terms. There is a definition of ""mouse"" that applies to physically existing living organisms, yet the designation ""mouse"" can also include fictional creatures.

2942,2020-12-17 15:39:38,kd8au0,"Ok but I want to make something clear. In biology form follows function. If we are talking about a deformity, that deformity itself is not a ""third sex"" in that we are not talking anymore about sexual reproduction. Human sexual reproduction involves a very specific set of attributes. Those attributes can vary but to follow the function they have to be within some range of suitability.

So when I talk about a deformity I'm not sayin ""a woman with an unusually big clit"". That completely outside of the discussion.

You can try and surgically adapt the deformity to what you expect the brain will feel later in life and is something that can be done to these patients by analyzing the androgenous hormone and early behavior.

Any other socially constructed category to fit deformities will likely create suffering and we as society need to find way to end deformities and dysphorias instead of creating a media and political circus around them.

A genital or chromosome deformity doesn't invalidate 99% of all human experiences and the complete history of biological evolution when it comes to defining what a man or woman is. So when someone says ""male = man, woman = female"" they have all of that to back that claim."

as for this being ""The Year of Trans Bigotry"", i think that's mostly just. literally anything the UK has done in the last 12 months. For whatever reason, England has decided that their cultural identity is hating trans people, and trans women in particular. Recently, their media has published a load of poorly disguised hate speech that's ended up cutting off a *lot* of trans people from getting their hormones, and they're making it a lot harder for trans kids to get puberty blockers, which by the way, are completely reversible, harmless treatments that gives trans kids the chance to not go through the hell that is wrong puberty.

but there's this idea that transphobes have been pushing, that doesn't actually exist but is a very effective rhetorical tool, that the medical industry is forcibly transing children, who would otherwise be pure wholesome christian cis kids. isn't true, doesn't happen, but the media is pushing it, and in fact, there was an article a day or two ago, that essentially said ""99% of trans people on hormones get happier, and that's a bad thing"". it's just poorly disguised hate speech. and people are falling for it, and being trans, particularly in the UK, has got a whole lot harder and more inaccessible."

The US Supreme Court ruling that trans folks could not be legally discriminated against got a lot of people's attention, and it fed that storm. TERFs being a term that got introduced to the world through media and social media spread a different type of ignorance and also contributed to the storm.  Elliot Page's coming out kept trans people in the news and only emboldened the most ignorant.

Against the backdrop of all this was the run-up the the most important election the U.S. has seen.

This sounds totally fine to me."
2989,2020-12-13 19:36:01,kcgkwh,"How you explained the falling off the bike situation is exactly right! You should used the person’s current pronouns (and name) to describe their past and if you need to have context, just add ‘before he transitioned’ to the statement, like you said about his role in Juno. There are a lot of people who are not transgender who play transgender characters (or even think of John Travolta playing the mom in hairspray), but the role that they play doesn’t change their gender irl (you would just say ‘John Travolta played the mom in hairspray, Elliot Page played a pregnant girl’). I understand, though, that people want to be more careful in the later situation to not come off as disrespectful :) Also keep in mind that people don’t just become transgender when they come out, the same way gay people don’t just become gay when they come out (and people don’t just come out once!) Trans people are trans before everyone else knows, and just because people still saw them as their assigned gender doesn’t make them not trans at that point in time. I hope this helps, good question!"
2990,2020-12-13 19:22:32,kcgkwh,"You still say ""He played a pregnant character in this movie"". People who don't know about the transition may ask for clarification, but it doesn't really change the 'context' of the sentence, which is just about his previous acting roles."
2991,2020-12-13 19:25:28,kcgkwh,"Always, always use current pronouns and names.

In the case of Elliot Page, ""he played a pregnant girl in a movie"" would be correct. If someone is confused by that, you could add ""he played a pregnant girl in a movie before transitioning"" to make yourself extra clear.

>Would you still say ""HE won homecoming queen"" wouldn't that change the context without explaining the fact they transitioned.

Similar thing. Definitely say ""he,"" and explain that he transitioned if people are confused. Or, if it's a case when you know they wouldn't want to be outed, just avoid the topic altogether.

And like another commenter said, ""they"" is virtually always a safe bet."
2992,2020-12-13 21:27:25,kcgkwh,As a transperson myself I would not be very happy to hear someone use wrong pronouns.
2993,2020-12-14 00:21:11,kcgkwh,"I know a guy who was a girl before and I asked this question once. We came into a conversation where we talked about being classmates a couple years ago when he was still a she. And suddenly I wondered what pronouns I should use when I was talking with someone else about him before his transition. So I asked what he would prefer. He told me that he get this question quite often and he said that he’d prefer to use him/he/his etc. Because he always felt like he was a guy, even though he was in a female body. He also told me this could obviously depend on the specific person and this could be just personal preference, but it clearly sounded logical to me."
2994,2020-12-13 19:19:04,kcgkwh,Personally in that situation I would use “they” just to be safe

2999,2020-12-13 19:16:09,kcgkwh,It's not just about this particular person but other transgender people as well. Even non famous ones. For example if a class mate won homecoming queen in highschool but then transitioned in adulthood to male. Would you still say HE won homecoming queen?
3000,2020-12-13 19:49:28,kcgkwh,"Yes, and you could clarify by saying something, ""He was female-presenting at the time,"" which affirms his maleness while also explaining how he won a female-coded title."
3001,2020-12-13 19:54:06,kcgkwh,"By presenting, do you mean he was a woman at that time? Not being a dick here. I genuinely want to understand the whole issue. I don't quite get it but really want to."
3002,2020-12-13 20:00:33,kcgkwh,"No worries! 

The core concept is, a trans person has always been the gender they transitioned to, even if they didn't realize it until they got older. So our hypothetical Homecoming Queen has always been male. ""Female-presenting"" means he used female pronouns and wore female clothing, despite being male. 

It's the same idea behind the phrase ""assigned female (or male) at birth."" It means everyone took a look at the baby and assumed the baby was one gender or the other. Which may or may not turn out to be accurate!"
3003,2020-12-13 20:08:46,kcgkwh,"OK. I understand what you mean. They felt a certain gender in themselves, like deep inside. They feel kinda like they were born in the wrong body so they decide to get as close to the one they feel comfortable in as they can by ""Female-Presenting"". Drag Kings and Queens are not necessarily trans, right? I learned about Drag Kings recently and I am fascinated by them. Is it offensive to say something like that? Jesus, this is a mine-field of unintentional faux pas."
3004,2020-12-13 20:22:46,kcgkwh,"> Drag Kings and Queens are not necessarily trans, right?

Lol this is actually a question on which the drag community cannot agree on. 

Theoretically, a drag queen is a cis (cis = not trans, someone assigned male at birth and turned out everyone was right) man dressing up like an exaggerated version of womanhood. It's conventional to refer to the drag queen as 'she' when she's in drag. Same thing for drag kings - cis women dressing up as an exaggerated version of manhood, and being called 'he' when dressed. Most of them also have stage names they only use when dressed & performing. 

But! Some trans people became comfortable with their gender by starting with drag. And there's no agreement as to if a trans woman can be a drag queen, even though how most women express their womanhood is nowhere near the over-the-top style you'd normally associate with drag. Ru Paul, probably the most famous drag queen, got in a *ton* of trouble for saying trans women couldn't be ""real"" drag queens. And that's not even touching on the question of, is doing drag (at least cis men dressing up as women) transphobic? I don't even know the answer to that one, I feel its something the drag community and trans community will have to work out for themselves. I'm not a member of either community, so I don't really have a dog in that fight."
3005,2020-12-13 20:52:03,kcgkwh,"I knew that some drag queens and kings have performances that they do like singing or whatever and you refer to them by their stage name at all times. Weird aside but I watch a lot of wrestling, wrestlers sometimes change character and name and referring to them by an old character name is considered very rude. Is that a similar kinda vibe?

So.....say a cis guy might be a woman inside but in order to kinda ease into the whole transition period they might become a drag act? Like a subtle drag queen type deal. Some of the trans community do not like cis dudes becoming drag queens because its kinda taking the piss or something? Like they are playing at something that trans people actually are going through in reality.

This is a complicated scene that I never knew existed."
3006,2020-12-13 21:08:27,kcgkwh,"To clarify, I think I was too vague in my previous comment, if someone AMAB (assigned male at birth) feels like a woman they are by definition not cis. 

And, yeah getting into drag is a relatively socially acceptable way to dress up and be treated like a woman, so it's an attractive route for someone questioning their gender to take. Most people know about gender dysphoria, the feeling of being in the wrong body. But the counterpart to that is gender euphoria, which is the happiness that comes from feeling like one is correctly expressing their gender. So a trans woman might realize she's trans when she sees herself as a woman and hears other people calling her 'she' and 'her' and experiences how correct that feels for her. Obviously it's not a universal experience, but one of my Insta follows is a trans man who performed as a drag king for several years before coming out. 

As far as the relationship between trans and drag, I don't want to speak for someone else, but here are some articles:

3007,2020-12-13 22:37:58,kcgkwh,I think I misunderstood. I realise that as a straight CIS male I cannot understand what trans or gay or any experience outside of my own. Not really. I am going to read through the links you sent me. Thank you for explaining a few things.
3008,2020-12-13 22:45:59,kcgkwh,">  I cannot understand what trans or gay or any experience outside of my own.

From one perspective, yes. But from another perspective, that's the entire meaning of empathy. 

And I do get it. Try this thought experiment, it's what helped me understand what it was like to be trans. 

Instead of imagining yourself as wanting to be a woman, imagine you *are* a woman. You wake up tomorrow with a fully female body, and society expects you dress and behave in certain ways. You're called ma'am everywhere you go, and if you try to correct people that you're male, they brush you off and say you're confused. Some of your body parts just feel *wrong*, like you've got these two alien growths on your chest. You want to fix it, but get accused of wanting to mutilate your body. You're told that God doesn't make mistakes, and you should just figure out how to cope with being a woman."
3009,2020-12-13 22:50:02,kcgkwh,Oh. That brings the whole thing into sharp focus. You are essentially trapped in a body you do not want. When you tell someone enough times that it feels wrong they think the problem must be in your head. Fuck.
3010,2020-12-13 18:44:20,kcfty8,"Trans folks can play cis roles if they’re comfortable doing it. Keiynan Lonsdale plays a cis male character in the flash, Ezra Miller plays cis male roles. The reality is that there simply aren’t enough trans characters for all trans actors to have jobs. Which is exactly why cis folks shouldn’t be taking the very few trans roles that are available. If Elliot is comfortable with it, then that’s what matters."
3011,2020-12-13 22:47:32,kcfty8,"I personally do not have a problem with him or pretty much anyone playing role of a gender they are not IRL. As far as they are comfortable with it and able to play it well of course. The problem is more the general reluctance of most producers today to hire transgender actors and let them play anything they are able to play (and in many cases portraial of us in both fiction and media, which hovewer is matter of creative people and producents more then actors themselves)."
3012,2020-12-13 18:43:46,kcfty8,If he’s comfortable then why stop him
3013,2020-12-13 18:54:29,kcfty8,"But why do trans actors have to play trans roles? If they are talented and good at playing other roles (trans or not), why not hire them for all types of roles?

In the first production I ever saw of the musical ""Rent,"" the gay character was played by a straight man, the straight male lead was played by a gay man, and the trans character was played by a cis man. They were all equally talented."
3014,2020-12-13 18:49:15,kcfty8,What do you think of straight actors playing trans roles?
3015,2020-12-13 18:57:54,kcfty8,"So there’s two main reasons why trans roles should be played by trans actors 
1) trans actors are not often hired for cis roles, like I’ve never seen a trans woman playing a cis woman. So if cis people are taking those roles, then they’re taking jobs away from trans folks who are already hired way less than cis actors.
2) it stigmatizes trans folks. If a trans woman is played by a cis man, then it encourages the idea that trans women are actually men in dresses rather than showing them as actual women."
3016,2020-12-13 18:55:15,kcfty8,"Wo that’s actually filled the coin i dint think of that , I think in this case it’s a bit more unique because he had the female role before he came out.

It’s actually a really hard question and in one way or another it will sound offensive. I think that in a perfect world in terms of gender you could play whatever character you could act well as (this has its limits such as race, and this is already becoming offensive). But we don’t live in a perfect world so I’m our world I think if the director was tasteful and it was in no way meant to marginalize the struggles trans people face then maybe it would be ok , but the question is would a cis person audition for the role of a trans character?"
3017,2020-12-13 19:11:31,kcfty8,"Trans actors should be hired for cis roles! If they have the talent, they should be hired.

Re: ""If a trans woman is played by a cis man, then it encourages the idea that trans women are actually men in dresses rather than showing them as actual women.""

Does this mean that if a trans woman has not fully transitioned (e.g., still has an Adam's apple, her voice hasn't changed to sound feminine), that she should not play the role of a trans woman because she doesn't yet ""pass""? Because if that IS the case, then she might still appear like a man in a dress.

I'm not trying to be offensive, I'm just saying, there are differences in the degrees to which trans folks can ""pass"" (which depends on a variety of factors), and if a trans woman still ""appears"" like a man, there's nothing you can do about the perceptions of the wider public—they might still perceive her as male (though of course I would hope people would see her as female)."
3018,2020-12-13 19:14:35,kcfty8,You make a very good points that I whole heartedly agree with that you !
3019,2020-12-13 19:13:34,kcfty8,"> would a cis person audition for the role of a trans character?

Sure (maybe not a lot, but here are some examples):
-In the TV show ""Transparent,"" the main actor is played by Jeffrey Tambor, a cis male.
-In the movie ""Boys don't cry,"" the trans man (and real-life person) Brandon Teena is played by cis female actor Hilary Swank."
3020,2020-12-13 19:37:50,kcfty8,"No it’s not about passing. It’s about the fact that people know that’s a male actor. He leaves the set in men’s clothes, he’d show up to the red carpet in a suit. A non-passing trans woman can absolutely play a trans woman, because she IS a woman."
3021,2020-12-13 15:50:20,kccmr1,"It's a catch-all term for ""not straight/cis"".

When I say I'm queer, personally I'm referring to both being trans and also being gay. It's an easy word for explaining my identity falls somewhere on the LGBT+ label without having to go into detail or out myself as anything more specific.

So trans people fall under the queer term whether they are gay, straight, or asexual."
3022,2020-12-13 15:45:03,kccmr1,"Queer is often an umbrella term for anybody not cis or not straight. So straight trans people fall under that.

I dont like to use it though, personally. A relationship where one person is trans is definitely considered queer to plenty though."
3023,2020-12-13 15:42:44,kccmr1,"Your sexuality isn’t defined by the relationship you’re in but by how you experience it. Just because they’re technically in a straight presenting relationship doesn’t mean they’re now straight. 

Sexuality is fluid by nature and it can develop and change as we do. 

If Elliot says he’s queer then that’s how he’s experiencing his sexuality. Considering he’s the best reliable source to talk about his own sexuality I’m not too sure how you can consider he’s wrong. 

I’d love to hear more of your thoughts on it, if you have the time?"

Calling oneself queer is fine, calling someone else queer when you dont know if they are fine with it isnt."

I just thought that the term queer would be central to Elliot's previous identity, and it would not survive to this new perspective. Is that a narrow minded perspective?"

3030,2020-12-13 15:50:21,kccmr1,"That's an interesting perspective, and will mull on it further - thank you. 


I would have thought that the two beliefs would have been contradictory; 'I believe myself to be a man' , and 'i am in a relationship with a woman' - in my head - would be inconsistent with also being queer.  


Or, that the perspective of being queer would no longer apply following when you make the mental transition, that queer was connected to Elliot's previous identity and would no longer survive."
3031,2020-12-13 15:55:34,kccmr1,"Kind of? I don't see why we wouldn't call ourselves queer when we do fit the definition.

To the best of my knowledge, queer is commonly used for “not straight”. I think that makes complete sense for someone to identify as queer regardless of who they’re currently with."

Ak took it all and held his head high while a dozen grown men were trying to bully him at the same time. He was articulate, took responsibility and challenged them when they were being disingenuous (Guap, Meek, Tory,...).

My respect for 21 Savage tripled after listening to the way he moderated the room AND checked his peers when they were trying to gang up on AK. He could have easily joined in on the “clown/kill Ak train” but he understood how counterproductive that would be. He was solution-oriented and that’s something I applaud.

3060,2020-12-13 16:49:22,kca14r,How the fuck is Tory even allowed to show his face much less try to “hold somebody accountable”? This shit crazy.
3061,2020-12-13 22:47:01,kca14r,"Ak was on his best form on EDS, and when he does a podcast he’ll thrive in that to. He’s mad intelligent and very fair when discussing topics. On his Twitch though.... he just gets way too brave and says too much stuff he’s not prepared to stand on if he bumped into the person"
3062,2020-12-13 17:37:02,kca14r,So who’s sending me the clubhouse invite
3063,2020-12-13 18:28:35,kca14r,"I was kinda on AK side even tho people was making points, but it just seemed like a lot of people was just trying to shit on AK. 21 was the only rapper to be like we gotta do better too. We shouldn’t be taking this shit to the internet. Everyone else was screaming about his platform, but not remembering they the ones talking crazy on THEIR platform. Ak is a vulture IMO after hearing this. All I kept thinking when they was asking him to change was fuck the IG page,ask these niggas to help you become a legit news/interview format online. Y’all want to help him change? Sit down for a full interview. Give him exclusive content promoting the things you want people to see and know."
3064,2020-12-13 19:46:01,kca14r,"I feel like how trendy this us and all the screen records on Twitter is gonna make clubhouse’s appeal of exclusivity blow up even more. 
Like more people are gonna wanna be on the app to experience celeb banter/ drama firsthand"
3065,2020-12-14 00:57:43,kca14r,It’s cringeworthy how corny some of the dudes In the room came off
3066,2020-12-14 06:53:29,kca14r,MAAAAAN THANKS FOR THE RUN DOWN... great summary
3067,2020-12-13 12:52:03,kca14r,INVITE ME TO CHATTY HOUSE!!!!
3068,2020-12-13 13:43:38,kca14r,"I'm not listening to a 3 hour pod on Akademics, sorry. See the thing is will cover this in 10 minutes so I can skip Joe's little rants about Shulz, Charla and all these other people i don't give a shit about 💅🏽"
3069,2020-12-13 13:59:26,kca14r,"""-Freddie Gibbs admitted on twitter this is more publicity for AK and they keeping his name alive.""

Freddie is a whole clown lets be real, to worry about akademiks clout at age 50 odd is a tragedy, let alone its *akademiks* he's literally the BBC News of hip hop, worrying about his popularity being high is just going to be a long salty time for you

Maybe I'm biased cos I fuck wit ak heavy but these grown ass millionaires always seem to be in the wrong to me when it comes to ak"
3070,2020-12-13 16:52:55,kca14r,"Ak will post anything and everything for clicks, he doesn’t care if it’s instigating or baiting or whatever"
3071,2020-12-13 13:01:43,kca14r,...Are you his publicist?
3072,2020-12-13 13:14:31,kca14r,Ak for sure is industry he just picks and chooses who to shit on
3073,2020-12-13 13:12:29,kca14r,I need that ch invite
3074,2020-12-13 21:51:27,kca14r,Do you have morals and principles tho?
3075,2020-12-13 16:25:11,kca14r,"This ""culture"" is becoming goofy. What the hell does any of this have to do with art or being creative? That's my issue with guys like Akademiks, they're the main culprits in creating this climate. It's starting to feel like pro wrestling. 

It's not all his fault because he's just exploiting the general public who like this nonsense and rappers clearly can't control themselves so it makes it worse. I'm honestly just sick of hearing his name. 

I wouldn't mind him if he stuck mostly to reporting on the culture in a positive way because when he's not on this shit he does have some good takes but that's like asking a fish not to swim."
3076,2020-12-13 16:25:16,kca14r,Ak started off a page that instigated Chicago violence solely for his benefit. I’ve never fucked with him.
3077,2020-12-13 15:59:35,kca14r,Imagine putting this much energy into this shit lmao man did a whole write up
3078,2020-12-14 01:29:55,kca14r,"OP is definitely AK.  This Reddit account only discusses AK related JBP issues and y’all falling for it. No one would have listened this intently to make such descriptive bullet points. 🤦🏾‍♂️  But I must respect his message board hustle, it’s his one true gift."
3079,2020-12-14 10:21:51,kca14r,“ I don’t like AK “ & then proceeds to write a love letter to how Ak defeated everybody 😭😭😭😭👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾
3080,2020-12-13 13:46:59,kca14r,I’m the same way. I loved his music but all his being angry on Twitter and other social media sites turned me off. Same happen with wale. Rappers should just rap and stay off the apps

3089,2020-12-13 20:06:36,kca14r,"That would be dope but the way Ak coming at Mal and ""Rury"", i doubt that would happen, especially from Mal's side.
I could kinda see Rory maybe be down with it(even tho Ak be coming at him crazyyy in his streams) i feel like Rory still level-headed enough to potentially have a conv. Mal just gonna be on his typical to cool for school type shit and just gon be like "" i don't communicate with corny niggas"""
3090,2020-12-13 15:19:34,kca14r,Rory and Mal ain’t trying to shine any light on Ak for obvious reasons lol

Grown men taking turns on stage... Looking to clown and make fun of akademiks lmao. They literally said we made this room to make fun of him 🤣🤣, 50 yr old dudes actually did this. 

 Hate him all u want but he alrdy won the battle if he got all.yall.in your feelings and you all resorted to this lmao to make yourself feel better."
3096,2020-12-13 16:05:27,kca14r,Old heads have an issue I’m with duke because of what he’s bringing to the culture.  Nip said the same thing about the guy.  They don’t appreciate what he’s bringing to something he had no hand in creating
3097,2020-12-13 16:30:01,kca14r,"The BBC comparison doesn't work because they have standards. 

AK is the Fox News equivalent of Hip Hop. Sensationalism and red meat for his followers. He knows how to rile them up and others, i.e. Fox News."

3105,2020-12-13 21:21:51,kca14r,How about people take accountability for their actions. Everybody was covering the situation but his platform got popular off of it.
3106,2020-12-14 21:05:21,kca14r,He didn’t instigate anything he reported on beefs as they happened. It was in bad taste but I think the insinuation that he’s responsible for violence is pretty unwarranted.

3111,2020-12-13 19:41:05,kca14r,On god that’s the same reason I unfollowed him lmao. It might be safe now that only fans poppin

3118,2020-12-13 17:36:31,kca14r,Just Rory and Mal.
3119,2020-12-13 14:24:14,kca14r,"And most of the time they get salty because he didn't promote them enough on his insta or he shared something they didn't want him to even though a thousand other blogs shared it too, it's not often they have legit reasons, he's just the most popular therefore they direct their insecurities/frustrations at him"

This is gonna sound wild but look at the shit Oprah was doing when she started her show. People can evolve but he needs to want to do better. I think he enjoys too much having his cult fan base who like all the fuckery."

3224,2020-12-12 11:29:34,kbm0wb,"Unless someone specifically says otherwise, it's best to use current name and pronouns, even when talking about the past.

There's very few circumstances where it'd be necessary to deadname someone else. The main ones I can think of is when someone isn't out to everyone and requests that people deadname them when around family members who don't know yet. Someone may have to reference their previous names while updating what name they use on paperwork but that's not a free pass to use that name for any other purpose than linking the two names together (eg, legal name change documents require both names, calling up services/companies/etc who use the old name would almost certainly require mentioning previous name - but only so that it can be corrected in future)

When first explaining that someone has come out, referencing their old name so that you know you're talking about the same person can be done tactfully (but best kept to a minimum), and with celebrities it can be avoided in future by referencing what they're known for.

Whether they've had any form of surgery or not, is not a reason to deadname someone.

EG, Elliot Page starred in the game Beyond: Two Souls, to whom he lends his likeness. As this was before he publicly came out, he is credited under his previous name."

Let me Google that for you, literally the top result:

>*Trans masculine identities are those of people who were assigned female at birth, but do not identify as female. We are a broad group of people who may identify as male, non-binary, agender, or “genderqueer”.*

-

>Can he be a male without hormonal/surgical transition?

Second half of the above definition:

>*Some of us, though not all, may seek medical assistance through the use of hormones or surgery.*

-

>If yes, then what does ""male"" mean?

Like many other terms, ""male"" is a word with different connotations depending on the context. One of Merriam Webster's definitions of male is:

>having a gender identity that is the opposite of female

Aren't you some kinda scientist or something?

>Her partner is female so now they are a straight couple? Is there a new term?

Wrong pronoun, they are a straight couple if they identify as such, and if they don't, they'll just tell you.

>Why go public with such a private matter?

It's not a private matter; ""gender"" has a strong social component. Whether you're trans of cis, to be able to fully live as your gender, other people usually have to know.

>Is this similar to the ""coming out"" campaign for gays in the 90 to bring about moral progress?

You can't think of any other reason why a homosexual couple might want to stop living clandestinely, besides bringing about some unspecified ""moral progress""?
Were you one of the people, ""in the 90's"", who used to declare that they had ""no problem with ""gays"""" but still objected to them ""forcing it down their throats"", by kissing and holding hands in public ""where children might see them""?
Not insinuating anything, Just Asking Questions...

Like, most of these gender questions are readily available, not just on google, but in every Sociological dictionary since the 70s. If they even looked up gender in a contemporary ""normal"" dictionary (as my 9 year old would), they would see that gender fluidity and the division between assigned sex and gender is not new AT ALL. They have zero curiosity about the world and no ability to engage with facts on any level.

I recently watched a clip from Jordan Peterson so I could figure out what he was about. I used to work in an anti-racism and anti-discrimination publicly funded youth organization and was paid to write anti-discrimination plays to perform in our highly conservative town, and I did the same research on ""racialist"" groups, which were considered somewhat legitimate at that time. I found the same thing. Both racist groups and transphobic gender-ignorance proponents really don't have any consistent logic - it's not a right vs left thing, their opinions are truly without any sort of consistency and it drives me to distraction that they are lauded as ""geniuses"" when their arguments fall apart in front of the most simple investigation. In the bit of Jordan Peterson I watched, he made at least 1 complete false, easily (and I mean EXTREMELY easily) disproven, illogical assumption in every single sentence. I actually had trouble watching because the lack of logic or knowledge was so exhausting. I felt as if every sentence was worth a small essay in which every sentence could refute his ludicrous claims, but the interviewer kept nodding her head, as if receiving grand wisdom. The fact he talks like Kermit the Frog doesn't make him wise, and the same can be said of all these ""skeptics"" asking ""honest questions."" My response to Shermer would be ""READ A BOOK,"" except based on the low level of comprehension and simplistic thinking patterns of these for-profit fake intellectuals, I think it would be a total waste. In essence, anybody who can spend literal decades studying an issue that could be resolved with a single dictionary entry must be lying, or, as I truly believe, must not have the capacity to understand what are ultimately fairly simple concepts.

I want to be clear though, I have nothing against the hiring and protection of individuals with severe learning disabilities, like the intellectual dark web - I think Shermer and his ilk should have productive work of their choosing - they can even work in an intellectual field, I just wouldn't hire them on a purely capability based model, without some support workers to help. For example, I think Jordan Peterson would work well selling popcorn, and Shermer could maybe, if properly supervised (so as to protect from his sexual violence) work in a factory, or at a gas station, something appropriate for his skill level. It's unreasonable and unfair that these people have jobs that they are so fundamentally unsuited for, but I'm not saying they shouldn't be allowed to work at all, nor should they suffer under a negative label, just because of their intellectual disability. I even think it would be fair, if they're unable to work without harassing coworkers for their gender, sex, or whatever else, that they could be provided basic assistance to stay at home and argue with people on YouTube.By the way, no /s, I have never seen an argument from these people that demonstrates they have the same intellectual capacity as my children, and I don't consider that a ""burn"" or an insult, just an unfortunate fact. The fact people like this get treated as serious intellectuals just underlines how married to anti-logic, anti-science, anti-feminism, anti-transqueer our social superstructure is, how necessary illusions push the overton window constantly further to the right and to the edge of mental capacity and sanity."

Cientificamente você aparenta ter disforia de gênero desde a infância. Casos como esse são complicados para pessoas sem experiência opinar porque uma disforia de gênero pode ser resolvida se assumindo gay ou realmente com uma transição de gênero, quem define isso é um profissional que analisa cada caso. Enfim, de qualquer forma espero que você se sinta bem =3"

One day soon, the trans community won’t live in fear, won’t be judged, and won’t be shamed. This will be global and accepted as just who people are."
3284,2020-12-12 04:16:37,kbgwf2,I'm really interested to see what the coaching staff does with Hurts.
3285,2020-12-12 14:37:17,kbgwf2,"First time on this sub: From /r/saints, whoever does these write ups is great!  The history, breakdowns, past matchups and all were great.  Looking forward to no injuries Sunday... and hopefully a W. Thanks for the great info!"
3286,2020-12-12 04:26:53,kbgwf2,"Yo ho ho from /r/saints \- Excited to see what Hurts can do this week seeing as we always make rook QBs look like HOF'ers. I'll be tanked for the game so there's that. 

Cheers!"
3287,2020-12-12 03:12:08,kbgwf2,"Imo the ideal situation here is a close, well-fought loss where we were simply outmatched. As much as I enjoy wins, I think draft position matters too much to win games at this point"
3288,2020-12-12 15:20:31,kbgwf2,Saints fan. I just want to give credit for this awesome write-up.  I forgot how good this sub is at doing these week to week since last year.
3289,2020-12-12 05:02:54,kbgwf2,"Saints fan fan here, good luck this weekend. This is a game I am worried about with KC looming next week and you guys starting Hurts, it just seems like a game we could lose if we don't take you seriously enough. 

Also, kudos to the users who created this thread. Lots of cool info and stats.  Way more in depth than I see in other subs.

Cheers!"

3291,2020-12-12 21:04:46,kbgwf2,I just wish Jordan Howard didn’t take snaps from Miles and that Alshon didn’t take snaps from Fulgham.
3292,2020-12-12 04:13:50,kbgwf2,My body is ready.
3293,2020-12-12 06:33:54,kbgwf2,"Gonna say it every week against the good teams until I’m right. 

We could win this one. We always play to our competition. Anything can happen."
3294,2020-12-12 13:00:38,kbgwf2,Tysom Hill rushing yards. Bet the over.
3295,2020-12-12 18:41:39,kbgwf2,"Wow, this is pretty incredible content.

Two thoughts: 

Cox makes me nervous because our interior OL has been lowkey average-bad.

What happened to Wentz (that is, what changed between 2017 and now)? Is it just injuries piling up? Poor OL play and he's always held the ball long?  Personally, I'm rooting for Hurts... after this game, of course.  I appreciate the kid's spirit."
3296,2020-12-12 04:54:19,kbgwf2,It irks me more than it rationally should that Press Taylor has an Instagram and Carson Wentz follows it. Coaches should be authority figures and maaaybe mentors...not social media buddies.
3297,2020-12-12 06:20:58,kbgwf2,What’s the o/u on Hurts passing yards?
3298,2020-12-12 08:00:56,kbgwf2,Personally I'm not looking forward to this one. I don't think we match up well overall. Doug will abandon the run by the second quarter simply cause I think the Saints will come here wanting to make this a scorefest. We will probably have to double team Michael Thomas and need all 3 linebackers on Kamara. Thats almost half the defense needed to account for two guys. My only expectations from Hurts is to survive and make the easy plays. If he plays against Arizona I will use that game to judge him. I just don't see any positives in this game.
3299,2020-12-12 14:25:41,kbgwf2,"As a saints and Alabama fan, I’m very excited for this game!"
3300,2020-12-12 15:54:36,kbgwf2,This is a glorified preseason game. It’s all about practice and a chance for Hurts to develop.
3301,2020-12-12 18:18:05,kbgwf2,The cardinals game vs. the saints last year where they didn't allow kyler and their offense to score a single touchdown is not encouraging.
3302,2020-12-12 19:12:25,kbgwf2,"As a saints fan in Philly, I was really looking forward to this game pre pandemic. I guess I'll just settle for Port Richmond residents yelling ""fuck the saints"" from their car when I wear saints gear. Warms my heart, really."
3303,2020-12-12 20:20:22,kbgwf2,"Hello from r/saints - thanks for putting this together!! So in depth. I’ve had a soft spot for Hurts and hope Peterson doesn’t take too much from this since his first start will be against a tough front seven!

Also your all black uniforms are so slick. It’ll be a great match up, uniform wise!"
3304,2020-12-13 00:38:34,kbgwf2,"Just another Saints fan here adding to what’s already been said, that’s a great write up, I really enjoyed reading it. Good luck to you guys, hopefully everyone comes out of this one healthy."
3305,2020-12-13 06:33:26,kbgwf2,I think this team comes out pissed off and gives the saints one hell of a game. Im taking the eagles
3306,2020-12-12 06:19:41,kbgwf2,I wanted Kamara so goddamn bad. I’ll never get over it.
3307,2020-12-12 16:07:56,kbgwf2,"We all know what happens here. Eagles win, we get stuck in the death spiral of we don't need Wentz, let's trudge along with Hurts as the starter for a few seasons...and then it's 2030 and we've still accomplished nothing. Ugh - let's stop this madness!"
3308,2020-12-12 03:50:20,kbgwf2,Can’t wait until Hurts has a great game and the world can finally see that Wentz was the main problem
3309,2020-12-12 05:53:47,kbgwf2,My guess is what they should have done with Wentz all along and rely on the run game it works and Hurts looks better even tho the real change was with coaching.
3310,2020-12-12 13:59:27,kbgwf2,"Probably designed rollouts, good running game, quick passes...you know the stuff we should have been doing all year"
3311,2020-12-12 17:23:42,kbgwf2,"I want to win out and shit on Wft and giants' hopes and dreams

Possibly winning a playoff game in the process."
3312,2020-12-12 15:57:16,kbgwf2,Totally agree. Just want to see promising play from Hurts and lose to help out draft stock so we can flip a better pick for a nice bounty when we trade down.
3313,2020-12-12 15:55:53,kbgwf2,This team is the worst I’ve seen in my 20 years as an Eagles fan. Don’t sweat it dude. They’re hot trash top to bottom.
3314,2020-12-12 03:59:39,kbgwf2,Imagine if we actually ran the ball down a teams throat to start the game to open up the passing attack?
3315,2020-12-12 23:38:16,kbgwf2,Howard isn’t playing I believe
3316,2020-12-13 08:11:32,kbgwf2,"Too tempting. I just went Eagles money line. 

https://imgur.com/gallery/hCZZToW"
3317,2020-12-12 17:19:59,kbgwf2,Ehhh I kind of think these days thats like: I can’t believe Press Taylor has a phone number and Carson KNOWS it.  Social media is just how people stay in touch.  I don’t see it as an authority boundary.
3318,2020-12-12 05:49:39,kbgwf2,I mean I don't have a problem with coaches being friends but a coach should know when to be authoritative and hold someone accountable or push him to be better and critical of him. I think press Taylor just can't do that and that's where the problem lies

3321,2020-12-12 17:35:29,kbgwf2,As opposed to sticking with Wentz until 2030 and still accomplishing nothing?
3322,2020-12-12 04:55:26,kbgwf2,Personally can’t wait for the day we can just be Eagles fans and not have some stupid A vs B debate. This team sucks regardless of who is QB.
3323,2020-12-13 00:08:36,kbgwf2,"I really hope we have a good plan. Hurts will be making his NFL debut against the #1 ranked defense. We need Ertz and Dallas to set up, O-Line to not play awful and Sanders to get good amount of touches to help Hurts.

Hopefully the coaching staff isn't setting up Hurts to fail. One of the worst things is giving him doubts that if he's a NFL starting caliber player. Wentz mentally doesn't seem right, we don't need the same with Hurts."
3324,2020-12-12 15:55:19,kbgwf2,When was the last time this team relied on the run game?
3325,2020-12-12 17:29:23,kbgwf2,If we win out we still probably won't make the playoffs. Stop thinking irrationally
3326,2020-12-12 16:05:42,kbgwf2,"Nope, Ja'Marr Chase please"
3327,2020-12-12 17:34:28,kbgwf2,"Fair enough, that’s probably part of it. I’m not that old, but my NFL career would be on thin ice if I was a running back, lol...I prefer some separation of work and personal, but I’m not a pro athlete or QB where the line is virtually nonexistent being so public facing."
3328,2020-12-12 19:59:12,kbgwf2,Last season. Even though miles is like top 5 in the league in YPC
3329,2020-12-12 17:39:11,kbgwf2,"What are you talking about? 

Washington and the Giants are still shit. Have you seen their schedule? You're acting like they're going to win out.  We have to win either the cardinals or saints game, and shit on the cowboys and washington in order to get in due to a tie. I say this because New York and Washington are probably not going to keep getting lucky as they did last week."
3330,2020-12-12 22:20:20,kbgwf2,If we win out we make the playoffs
3331,2020-12-12 16:06:28,kbgwf2,He would be a waste here. We need a total rebuild.
3332,2020-12-13 00:10:30,kbgwf2,Bruh if we win out and make the playoffs we'll get a home game. Anything can happen in the playoffs. I doubt we'll get a SB ring but shit just winning a playoff game would be legit asf.
3333,2020-12-12 16:07:25,kbgwf2,"Yeah, but..but...a legitimate WR1"
3334,2020-12-13 06:13:03,kbgwf2,"“Winning a playoff game would be legit asf”

More at 11."
3335,2020-12-12 16:10:28,kbgwf2,"lol I know. We need that so bad. I’ve been crying for a legit WR1 since the TO days. Trust me I want one so bad. The timing just doesn’t seem right now. 

I just see us being a dumpster team for the next few years. We need to recycle so much of the roster and the prudent move would be to amass picks and take a bunch of young talent in after we cut all the expensive old players off this roster. We need to replace Cox, Jackson BG, Lane, Slay, McLeod, and still get a LB we haven’t had since the Reid era it seems. A lot of turnover needs to happen especially being like $60m over the cap half of which is in players who aren’t playing for us."
3336,2020-12-30 14:19:49,kn2otr,"You may as well try and if you don't want to out yourself as trans until you're sure they're not transphobic, just say you're there because you're questioning your sexuality."
3337,2020-12-30 23:32:56,kn2otr,"Are you in the UK? If so, and if you are not at an Oxbridge uni, I wouldn't worry about acceptance. Universities are generally painfully liberal (in the sense of not getting anything done because they're so concerned about not offending anyone and consulting everyone). The only concern is about getting pigeonholed. I'm bi, wasn't out at Uni as anything, and was concerned about that too. In retrospect I think that was a mistake, but it means I really can't counsel you on what's best for you. Do let us know what you decide, though."
3338,2020-12-31 12:15:49,kn2otr,Oh thx! I did'nt think at that option!

3340,2021-03-02 00:19:42,kn2otr,Why single out oxbridge?
3341,2021-03-02 01:42:39,kn2otr,"Because they're generally filled from private schools, and brought up to be less accepting. Other universities are more reliably Liberal. Most of the Tory party went to Oxbridge Universities."
3342,2020-12-30 10:07:28,kmzlha,">Okay im going to go into detail so im sorry if this is long. I also apologize im not very good at writing. Growing up I always felt like a girl. I was so excited when I got my period because I was ""becoming a woman"" and when my boobs were growing I was beyond excited. I started getting thoughts of being transgender when Elliot Page came out as a trans male, all of a sudden thoughts came into my head like ""what if im transgender."" since then I've been searching through my childhood memories and asking my parents If I ever showed signs of being a boy They said no and said I showed more signs of being ""too feminine"". And for a while I convinced myself that I was a girl and these thoughts of being a boy are just part of my OCD (diagnosed at age 10).

&nbsp;

>But they came back bigger than ever. One thing that made me think I was transgender was when I had a tiny crush on this boy who was perfect in every way. He had great style, he had a great personality, and he was just overall an amazing person to hangout with. He came out to me as gay and I wasn't upset about it. I mean I was, but not as upset as I should've been?  Ive seen girls talk about their crushes coming out as gay and they said they wanted to kill themselves. Ive also told people that I wasn't upset about it and they said I should've been heartbroken.

&nbsp;

>Ive also talked to some friends about these thoughts and they asked ""well how would you feel if you woke up as a boy?"" and I've been thinking about this question for a while, I feel like I wouldn't mind having a penis but at the same time not want a penis, if that makes sense. I also don't enjoy looking in the mirror before I get into the shower because I've never been attractive naked but my thoughts have been telling me I hate looking in the mirror because I hate being a girl. I watched a YouTube video about TOCD and denial and the man who explained what denial FREAKED me out cause he said people who are in denial about being trans are obsessed with the fact of being trans and everyone in the comments agreed with him, which doesn't make any sense to me cause I feel like that wasn't true.

&nbsp;

>I also don't sleep with a shirt on and my OCD tells me its cause I don't want boobs. But when I think about being in a relationship I've always imagined me being the girlfriend. But when I came out as bisexual it didn't feel enough? and when big mouth season 4 came out and the trans girl talked about how she first came out as gay it didn't feel enough and then came out as trans and that led me into a spiraling, anxiety feeling void that gave me a huge panic attack that lasted hours.

&nbsp;

>These thoughts have gotten so bad that I don't remember what being a girl feels like. Ive already tried some things that have ""calmed down"" these thoughts but in the end they come back stronger than before. And if I were to be asked if I wanted to be a boy or a girl I would pick a girl. Does anyone have any thoughts of what I could do or what I am? Im already in therapy but it doesn't really seem like my therapist cares.

No one can really tell you for sure what you are, but this definitely sounds like what other people with OCD have experienced on this subreddit. It’s like your mind is desperate to prove something that you logically know to be untrue. 

I know this really sucks, but it’s important to let the thoughts just pass and to label them as intrusive. The more we fight them, the more they fight back, thus perpetuating the OCD cycle. 

It will get better with time and conscious effort!"
3344,2020-12-31 06:29:22,kmzlha,the problem with labeling them as intrusive thoughts is the thoughts come back saying im only calling these thoughts as intrusive thoughts because I can't accept myself and it goes in an endless rotation of awful thoughts. thank you for commenting though :)

3346,2020-12-30 05:06:28,kmvaja,I was wondering if it was just me that saw that. Didn't know he was vegan.
3347,2020-12-30 05:28:04,kmvaja,I saw a YouTube comment asking why he doesn’t look 33- I said it’s because imo he’s too skinny and that I hope he’s healthy and ok- I didn’t say anything about veganism or anything- and I got jerks telling me that I’m wrong cause “skinny people actually look younger than fat people” and that he looks “totally healthy” like.... you can see the bones in his forehead... his legs look a mile apart because of the thigh gap... he is underweight. Like I had an eating disorder for years and seeing him was triggering.
3348,2020-12-30 14:24:14,kmvaja,I’m not anti trans but I wonder if there’s any relationship there too.

3350,2020-12-31 23:32:16,kmvaja,"Its interesting. We had Sesame Street on and Jason Mraz does one of his songs on there. I was like, why does he look like a cadaver? Then I was like, I'll bet he's vegan. Looked it up... sure enough."
3351,2020-12-30 06:21:52,kmvaja,"I don't really follow celebrities much so I looked at some past pictures and yeah it does look like a lot of the softness from his face has gone. His eyes look more sunken and his skin looks kind of ""stretched"" over his face and not full; losing facial volume is typical with collagen breakdown.

Maybe veganism has contributed. He's been vegan for quite a while now right?"
3352,2020-12-30 22:23:28,kmvaja,"I always noticed. I actually knew he was vegan, but I never actually remembered to bring this up. His face literally looks like it's melting. Sunken eyes and flaccid skin have become a telltale mark for me to evaluate how long people have been on a vegan diet. 

What is weird is that she always had this child like appearance even in her 30's. For comparison, Thomas Brodie-Sangster is 3 years younger than her, and has the same ""childish"" look, yet Elliot has LITERALLY deteriorated over time, so you can't even say it was normal aging."
3353,2020-12-30 19:31:53,kmvaja,This person is so far gone. I can't say anymore than that.
3354,2020-12-30 05:05:06,kmvaja,"Yeah man, he’s been vegan for a decade I think. He looks like he’s breaking down tbh and I say this with concern"
3355,2020-12-30 16:07:28,kmvaja,"I’m thinking it’s a combination of multiple factors. Diet, mental health, coupled with the transition of coming out, media pushback, etc."
3356,2020-12-31 18:18:50,kmvaja,"I did wonder if being trans stressed him out and contributed to him being underweight, and I do hope that coming out will alleviate some of that stress so he can focus on his health more."
3357,2020-12-30 18:10:53,kmvaja,"Do you mean as far as taking hormones affecting his facial structure? Typically transmasculine people would take testosterone if they were to transition, and testosterone actually stimulates collagen production and thickens the dermis.

If you mean that the stress of coming out as transgender, that could be very real."
3358,2020-12-30 08:07:24,kmvaja,"Yeah. Look at his pictures this past year. He’s deteriorated pretty badly, and it can’t be due to age"
3359,2020-12-30 05:18:49,kmvaja,"yeah you're absolutely right, he looks terrible. i thought he was going to come out as a cancer patient or anorexic"
3360,2020-12-30 20:20:40,kmvaja,I just mean the diet contributing to mental illness which has a well established connection to gender dysphoria.
3361,2020-12-30 20:26:42,kmvaja,Yeah that seems really unnatural for a healthy 33 year old.
3362,2020-12-30 20:23:55,kmvaja,"Respectfully, that isn't really a sensitive or informed way to discuss transgender people and is somewhat short-sighted and ignorant. I'm not really here to have a discussion about being transgender, seeing as this is a subreddit about ex-veganism, but it might benefit you to look into some LGBT subs and the relationships between being transgender and mental illness. It isn't necessarily causative of being transgender, it's more correlative."
3363,2020-12-30 20:47:56,kmvaja,"I am part of the lgbt. Look up the enormous rise in transgenderism in women in the last decade. It’s far and away beyond what it would be were it not for it being the result of some kind of mental problems and it being in fashion in some circles. Check out Abigail shrier’s book, Irreversible Damage."
3364,2020-12-30 22:16:24,kmvaja,"While I do understand your point, I do feel that the possibility that someone might think they are trans due to mental issues does not invalidate that transsexuality is a real, and even biological, phenomenon. 

Just because something exists and is valid, doesn't mean that other people might not follow it due to confusion or other issues.

This might seem like an ""insensitive"" example, but I feel it would be something like edgy 14 year olds saying they are bipolar because they have a mood swing vs people who actually deal with it.

I am saying this might be insensitive because I Not trying to suggest that his transsexuality isn't valid or is just trying to get attention, but maybe that it isn't stemming from an actual transsexuality so much so as from mental issues.

Most transgenders identify really early on, while Elliot and Caitlyn Jenner had a different story. No problem with that, but I think that OP made raised a valid point"
3365,2020-12-30 21:14:24,kmvaja,"Abigail Shrier's book is far from reputable and considering she is a PragerU contributer her works can hardly be described as unbiased.

A lot of her commentary can be immediately debunked. An example: the puberty blockers she claims cause ""permanent infertility.""

Puberty blockers are GnRH analogues. They are used not only for puberty suppression, but also for initiating puberty, IVF, endometriosis treatment, and more. Their use for IVF alone should raise flags about her claims regarding how they cause infertility.

The biological effect of puberty blockers is to either stimulate or suppress the production of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) in the pituitary gland. This is similar to hormonal birth control except that the hormones are not added back.

They have few side effects, if any at all; side effects are not direct and come from the suppression of gonadal function. If you go off puberty blockers, FSH/LH production resumes and gonadal function kicks in again.

Another claim that she makes: ""In the past, gender dysphoria was believed to have .01% prevalence, but it seems like more now, don't it?""

She has no viable data to support this yet makes a blanket claim anyway. Neither the DSM-I (1952) nor the DSM-II (1968) historically contained a diagnosis analogous to gender dysphoria. Additionally, the DSM-III-R (1987) only recently added ""Gender Identity Disorder of Adolescence and Adulthood, Non-Transsexual Type"" (GIDAANT).

It's also possible that we lack long-term data because transgender people were, well, routinely fearful of death and other factors if they were to come out or express themselves. So historic data is significantly limited and yet this is one of Shrier's major claims.

I'm absolutely willing to consider what contributes to gender dysphoria including possible recent environmental changes and pressures, which yes could include change in diet, but it needs to come from a reputable source and her book is not one.

Also worth noting that not every transgender person experiences dysphoria in the first place so trying to link being transgender to mental illness due to dysphoria doesn't make sense."
3366,2020-12-30 22:48:55,kmvaja,"For your awareness, ""transsexual"" is an outdated term and transgender people should not be called ""transgenders."" That language is considered disrespectful by the majority of the transgender community. Just call them transgender people.

It also isn't entirely correct that transgender people typically identify early on in their lives; that may be true for people who experience dysphoria but not everyone does and so it isn't a universal experience. Also consider that not everyone has the privilege and comfort to be able to come out as transgender early on and there are not always ""signs"" of it right away or the parents might outright ignore them; we certainly lack data here but it isn't at all unusual for trans people, especially those who don't experience dysphoria, to come out later on in life.

That aside, what you're saying doesn't sound insensitive. I don't disagree that believing you are transgender could be partially or wholly biological because for many people yes that is a huge component of it. And yes it could also be social for some people, because maybe it sounds fun to be transgender or something (people will always experiment with their identities, I think.) I just found the original commenter's post to be somewhat ignorant considering that gender dysphoria which stems from chromosomal abnormalities and other ""at birth"" conditions are not due to diet. It just didn't sound like an informed or complete argument.

Edit to add: we don't know whether Elliot Page experiences dysphoria or in what context his experience is so that also contributed to my above thoughts. If he doesn't experience dysphoria then veganism causing him to be transgender doesn't make any sense in the context of that comment."

“Elliot Page refused to come to set over his concerns about the pandemic.”

With cancel culture being as strong as it is, even the news outlets and celebrities who used his correct pronouns mightve still been transphobic and just hidden it.

Plus, he's a rich famous white man, so, of course people will be nicer. At least it might make it easier for people to start accepting trans folk since one of their favorite stars came out."

You want something EXTREMELY specific in a partner. You have every right to want that, but you also need to understand that wanting something specific doesn't mean you get to try to force people to become that thing and get upset when they don't become it. 

You're not smarter than these people, you're just a part of something that people aren't exposed to or are usually not interested in being exposed to. You might be more knowledgeable on that subject, but don't put yourself on a pedestal or think you're superior or ""more educated"" than them because you have more knowledge in this particular thing.

3378,2020-12-29 08:16:31,km3qac,"You are conflating education with political viewpoint.  

Whether or not someone has a degree or is well read has no bearing on what opinions they will hold about the world, and in fact the more well read they are, the more likely their ideas will be nuanced and idiosyncratic.   

You should either broaden your acceptance of potential partners' ideas, broaden your acceptance of dating people of different educational levels, or understand that you are severely limiting your pool of choices to an extremely small (and likely high demand) group of people with your specific views and educational attainment.  

There is nothing wrong with sticking to your guns and being choosy, its just going to be harder and take longer.  I had to broaden my scope of peoples politics I would accept in dating  and it has only been beneficial and informative.  No one grows by shacking up with a carbon copy of themselves."

I have no advice to offer, as I am still single because of this reason. I am highly educated, thanks to the hard work of my parents, but I also have the life experience to educate me further on the subjects you highlighted. 

I am a cisgendered Black female with a high paying job in a major metropolitan city that is quite expensive to live in. For those reasons, dating is fucking awful. If you continue to date White people, their privilege will always be an issue until you meet the unicorn who’s done the introspective work.

Like climate change, and unfortunately being environmentalist is something a lot of people won't accept in a partner but its something I won't budge on.  It severely limits my options, but I allow myself that one hard dealbreaker because its the one I cant force myself to budge on.

: the name that a transgender person was given at birth and no longer uses upon transitioning

Definition of deadname (Entry 2 of 2)
transitive verb
: to speak of or address (someone) by their deadname

I am so sorry your mom didn’t take it very well. I don’t want to excuse her behavior, and I don’t want to hurt you, but I think your mom teacted this way because she feels like she lost a daughter and has to get used to it, or (which others have said as well) she may not have taken you seriously the first time because you were joking. 

Now I understand how hard this is, but if your sister and dad live in the same house, I’d tell him sooner rather than later, because obviously if she’s gonna call you ‘he’ your dad is gonna know. 

It’s hard, but a serious conversation about the matter is important, as well for them to understand and (hopefully) accept you, as to start a treatment if you so wish. Again, rather sooner than later. 

As you’ve come out to your mom and sister, I think you are ready to become more yourself, so I wish the best for you, for you to become more like your true self. 

Your sister is awesome and best of luck with everything💜"

It makes more sense to call her Elliot, as from here on out, he identifies as Elliot. In 15 years, if he is still acting, if you said, ""ah yes Ellen was great in Juno"", some fans might not even know who youre talking about.

As also discussed in the thread, legal name changes are nothing new. If someone you knew changed their first name for whatever reason, and you were recounting a story from before that time, if their name ever came up as a part of the story it would be as simple as acknowledging that their name was different back then and moving on with the story. But that doesnt mean for the whole tale you would call them by their former name, because youre supposed to be using their new name now, and it just makes sense to use their current name that they want you to use unless specifically relevant.

Thats what i mean about basic respect, is that if there is a reason to point out their previous name, like in the case with recognizing his role in Juno, you can literally just note the fact his name has since changed and move on. And if there is no reason for their previous name to be included in the conversation, then why mention it at all?"

Anorexia is completely regressive. When successful, anorexia leads directly to death, if not by starvation then by organ damage or some sort of self harm. There are also known treatments for body dysmorphia and I think its important to utilize those. Either way, I think its strange to comment on anyones body unless pertinent to the conversation youre having. Its another thing
 that just commands a basic level of respect.

Gender dysphoria is not regressive, and it is possible to live a full life while experiencing those dysphoric symptoms because is not a straight drive towards death. This is important because we dont yet have a cure for gender dysphoria, so instead people dress the way they want, receive gender affirming surgeries, and go on hormones.

One day there will probably a cure for everything, or damn near close to it. We are not there now and these are the best treatments available for gender dysphoria.

Be that as it may, being offended is the price of admission for a truly free society. If you can't handle being called a name or a gender you don't like, well then I'm sorry for you, but there are sacrifices we all make in a society where you can speak without consequence.

I agree. I dont know why you think I would disagree. I just *also* think that people should try to not be intentionally disrespectful to other people. My argument isnt that liberals on the internet should be out here virtue signalling about being the better trans ally, or that trans folk should be able to live without ever hearing their previous name or gender.

Its just that if you're going to be out here, doing things you know will seem transphobic or could come off as disrespect, *you* can't act like theyre being extreme when they do ask for that basic amount of respect. And I think that the most sensible way to acknowledge a transition, name or otherwise, without being disrespectful, is to just mention it in the sentence. I dont think thats too complicated."

General:

- do minor things and see how this makes you feel. Shave legs, try bits of make up, etc. This doesn’t necessarily make you trans if you enjoy these things but it may help

- is there anyone you can tell who is trusting? This took a weight off, especially with shame, and helped me work through things a lot easier 

- explore in non sexual settings. I initially thought it was a kink too. Do really boring things like housework presenting a certain way

Manchester:

- LGBT Foundation is massively helpful. Through the website you can get gender counselling for free - I found this the most helpful thing.

- They also do monthly trans meet-ups. I don’t really go anymore but it was useful early on

- There is also a NHS pilot scheme through the LGBT Foundation called Indigo - basically if you are on a waiting list for an NHS Gender Identity Clinic (may want to do this first) and are registered with a Manchester GP, you are eligible to obtain hormones and other transitional treatments through indigo. I’m due to be seen early next year, despite the fact it only rolled out in December 

- partisan collective are another excellent queer community, particularly for socials and activism

What do we wrongfully support next? Schizophrenia, D.I.D? Where does it end? Medically, we do these people a huge disservice by validating their delusions.

I said the disorder itself isn't dangerous, however a benign tumor isn't in and of itself dangerous, but left unchecked or untreated it can be life-threatening. The same way that letting someone incorrectly identify as a gender that they are not can be, due to it being an unchecked, untreated mental illness. Gender dysphoria is the underlying condition. Dysphoria means a state of unease or dissatisfaction. Left unchecked, it can cause them mental anguish that can lead to suicide or other forms of self harm, not because of ""society alienating them"" which isn't accurate either. Society doesn't,  but individuals do. Especially individuals who see what is CLEARLY someone of ome gender insisting that they be addressed as another gender, and realizing that no amount of imagination is going to make it factual. Not to mention people having to explain to their children why that clearly-Male individual keeps insisting that he's a lady. Sadly, I had to explain to my kids why the PA health secretary has long hair and dresses like a woman, even though he is QUITE EVIDENTLY a biological male.

And that extensive research you're looking for from me, I have previously stated. Therapy of both the psychiatric and pharmaceutical kind. NOT shock conversion therapy. Many times, all these people need is someone to talk to to realize that there are underlying issues. If you can't be bothered to do a quick internet search on something that simplistic, I'm not about to spend my time doing it for you.

Keep insisting upon your viewpoint all you like. It still doesn't make it fact. 

And as for the trans individual who committed suicide, I knew them for a brief period of time, and they committed suicide 3-4 years after the last time I saw them. It had absolutely nothing to do with me. The individual in question was deeply mentally disturbed and it manifested in unfortunate ways."

He's still a genetic male, XY chromosomes, and no amount of surgery or HRT will change that, it's not medically possible."

You’ve miss my point, I’m afraid. Shapiro is speaking to his audience who would know the larger context of these videos. To do a full explanation every time would break the time constraints and format of his shows.

Parents kick out their kids for being trans, trans people are legally murdered, banned from the military, banned from sports, banned from using a public toilet, being denied capable jobs, housing, and services.

3713,2020-12-27 08:41:14,kkxpih,"So much of what you have said is just fucking factually inaccurate or flat-out wrong. 

Trans people are NOT legally murdered. Not in the U.S. any way. That's complete and utter bullshit, and shame on you for trying to spread that sort of garbage.

They're rightfully banned from military service. I know a thing or two about military service, so here, I speak with first-hand experience. It's already a mentally and physically tough job. What we DON'T  need is someone who is already dealing with mental issues, who is MORE likely to commit suicide, who absolutely needs therapy that they won't have time for, because the training schedule is 24/7 and you don't just get time off to go see the shrink, because you should have showed up with your head right in the first place. If you ARE going to see the shrink, then you're non-deployable and non-operational. Plenty of guys with PTSD have to go see the doc, but again. They're non-operational, they aren't going to be leading people into combat if their PTSD is bad enough to warrant psychiatric help. So your argument there, while yechnicallyaccurate, isn't valid. Mental illnesses of all kinds are disqualifies for military service. Depression, anxiety, psychopaths, sociopaths, schizo, OCR, A.D.D, A.D.H.D....plenty of things disqualify you. We won't take just anybody. Meet the requirements or don't bother showing up.

As for sports...well, yeah. Men shouldn't be aying womens sports, as it isn't fair to the actual women, and women can't generally compete in mens sports. This isn't an opinion, it's fact. Thus why you don't see women in the NFL, NBA, NHL, MLS, or MLB.

And as for the rest of your argument: you cannot be legally denied jobs, public bathrooms (of your biological gender), housing, or services be cause of your mental state. If you are, then you need to retain a lawyer because laws are being broken. There are laws specifically to the mentally ill, the physically disabled, the mentally handicapped, etc...among others, there's the ADA (the Americans with Disabilities Act). There are also anti-discrimination laws. LGBT is even a protected class of citizen....although if I were y'all I'd be insulted by the notion that you're incapable of protecting yourselves and thus need special legal protection, but that's just my $0.02 there.

So, no, half the country DOES NOT see you as the ""enemy"" and no, it is NOT legal to discriminate against you, those are BOTH lies, and in fact the exact opposite is true. 

I'd say try again, but I'm seriously already tired of your self-imposed victimhood. Enough already. I'm done responding to you. Go make up bullshit elsewhere."
3714,2020-12-27 08:52:55,kkxpih,"The gay panic defense makes it legal to kill trans people in 39 states, the religious freedom act makes it legal to deny housing, jobs, and Healthcare to trans people, 60% of american polled said they would not accept their child for being trans, currently in America there are 1.6 million homeless teenagers kicked out of their homes for being trans. Say its bullshit. I fucking lived it."
3715,2020-12-27 11:23:18,kkxpih,"Ya know, it took me all of three minutes, THREE FUCKING MINUTES to do a little bit of research and figure out that, once again, you're dishonestly slanting things to look more favorable to you, but still basically lying about it.

The Gay Panic Defense does NOT ""make it legal to kill trans people"". It's a defense strategy where 1) the accused is undoubtedly guilty and 2) the defense attorney is looking to mitigate the sentence.

So, NO, it DOESN'T  make murder legal. It's a defense used when the perpetrator is already guilty and they're trying to escape, say, the death penalty or life without the possibility of parole.

You fucking child. Seriously, did you think I was incapable of using an internet search and reading? Pathetic.

And the Religious Freedom Act gives PRIVATE citizens the right to exercise their personal prerogatives to discriminate without the offended/effected party being able to sue. And that's perfectly fine. You cannot force a  religious person to act against their convictions. THAT is unconstitutional. 

Likewise, you couldn't force a gay DJ to work at a wedding for the Westboro Baptist church, not that any of them would, but that's the inverse.

As for the rest....those are private citizens with their own opinions. I have no control over them nor would I want to. It's not up to me, OR YOU, to infringe in free will.

Now...are you done with your fucking victim olympics?"
3716,2020-12-27 14:00:58,kkxpih,"Except that defence *has* lead to aquitals. And the ""private citizen"" defence absolutely does not fly when it's an employer discriminating against potential employees, and *especially* when that ""private citizen"" happens to be working on behalf of the government, or supplying housing. Peoples personal lives have **nothing** to do with a landlord. As long as they aren't breaking the law, damaging property or not paying rent, it's none of their damn business, especially not their religions business either."
3717,2020-12-27 22:18:03,kkxpih,"Oh yeah? Show me where someone was COMPLETELY ACQUITTED or murder using that defense alone. I'll wait.

Also, the private citizen thing....is completely legit. Private employers have s right to hire or not hire whoever the fuck they want. For instance,if I owned a business, I wouldn't hire anyone who an admitted drug-addict, pedophile, communist, or sexual predator, and that's my right as a private citizen.

Now, the government can't discriminate on who it hires, large corporations generally all have rules against it as well.

As for ""working on behalf of the government"" you're correct there. They have to abide by the laws of their employer, quite obviously. 

And landlords have a right to not rent their rooms/houses etc to people. Is it maybe not nice? Sure. But it isn't illegal. If I had an apartment to rent, same thing: no commies, ex-offenders of any kind, or drug-addicted. My call, since it's my place."
3718,2020-12-28 00:06:05,kkxpih,"Not if it's a protected class. That's literally the point of it, so that people cannot discriminate against them because of their bigotry. And as long as they haven't broken law, you have absolutely no right to intrude into someone's medical history either. That's *their* right."
3719,2020-12-27 05:09:05,kkxnws,Yeah but it was like a happy “well I’ll be damned” kinda shock.
3720,2020-12-27 06:00:29,kkxnws,"Yeah, not even remotely shocked."

3727,2020-12-28 02:35:55,kkxnws,"First to wish me a Happy cake day, which is weird, since it's been up since yesterday.  Maybe Happy cake day is a fading custom."

3729,2020-12-26 22:20:22,kkpiiy,"I mean, of course it’s not nice to have the deadname in bold letters at the top of the page like that, but the fact that it includes results for it is not necessarily a bad thing since otherwise, older sites or documents that perfectly fit the search might not be found as easily just because they haven’t been corrected after the person came out."
3730,2020-12-26 22:22:59,kkpiiy,"Well, yea, but the meme is just saying I don’t want to see his deadname and would rather only see articles that have been corrected lmao. Yes, you’re right, but thats not the point of the meme"
3731,2020-12-26 22:30:57,kkpiiy,"Yeah I know... I’m just the type of person that will throw random comments like that with a kind-of-objective and more technical viewpoint just cause some people might wanna know. But don’t worry, I did understand the meme and I do think it’s nice."

3733,2020-12-26 20:14:18,kkozgj,"I do understand that people may want a better draft pick, but this week you simply don’t root for draft positioning. 

I don’t give a fuck what the situation is, how good either of our teams are, beat Dallas. 

Always, always, always beat Dallas"
3734,2020-12-26 20:35:32,kkozgj,"Screw the draft pick, this is the one game I absolutely always will want to win"
3735,2020-12-26 21:17:24,kkozgj,"Eagles are probably gonna win this but won't matter as washington probably wins theirs. Still I want a win, because fuck Dallas."
3736,2020-12-27 01:09:45,kkozgj,If only Cardinals played like this against us
3737,2020-12-27 03:45:32,kkozgj,Fuck you if you root for the draft pick. We always root against Dallas.
3738,2020-12-26 20:44:40,kkozgj,Troy Aikman can eat my farts.
3739,2020-12-26 21:47:38,kkozgj,Been looking at every scenario as a win at this point...if we make the playoffs the playoffs is always fun and if we don’t well we get a great draft pick. Just hope it’s an entertaining game!
3740,2020-12-27 21:32:15,kkozgj,"Did that announcer just say what I think he said?

What the actual fuck? 

Doug Pederson is run first? This dude doesn’t have a clue."
3741,2020-12-26 22:02:10,kkozgj,"Missing Barnett and Sweat is going to hurt us a ton, I doubt Carolina wins but it looks like our playoff push ends here. That said, I still want to win, fuck Dallas let’s sweep them!"
3742,2020-12-27 06:37:20,kkozgj,"Probably the wrong place but as a new fan of Jalen Hurts living on the west coast we don't get the Eagles game.  Any recommendations on how to watch it?  I just have basic cable, and the NFL only shows the nationally broadcast games as well as what I can already see locally."
3743,2020-12-27 02:32:32,kkozgj,"Watching the Clemson-Bama National Championship game from 2017 on ACC Network (I’m a Clemson fan). It’s weird watching it now seeing Jalen Hurts and rooting for Jalen, but also rooting for Clemson. Clemson won this one anyway so that makes it easier."
3744,2020-12-27 19:52:23,kkozgj,I can’t believe some of you are rooting for when WFT if they win they win but if my team has a chance to make some noise in the playoffs I’ll always root for that.
3745,2020-12-27 03:12:08,kkozgj,Ah shit here we go again
3746,2020-12-27 20:26:26,kkozgj,"Even if u were rooting for WFT due to draft position just realize how much of a shitty franchise they are. With all the snyder stuff and also Haskins idk how you could root for them.

Not to mention its a joke how NFL screwed over Denver but is allowing Haskins to play"
3747,2020-12-27 02:47:00,kkozgj,Let's go Eagles! I can't wait for us to beat those Cowboys and sweep them this season. Go birds! Go Carson!
3748,2020-12-27 13:28:08,kkozgj,I see a lot of points being scored in this game by both sides
3749,2020-12-27 21:32:20,kkozgj,Mailata just rag-dolled jaylon smith on the Hurts run oh my
3750,2020-12-27 18:47:48,kkozgj,"Don't mind me, just a nervous cowboy fan that has Jalen Hurts starting at as his fantasy quarterback on championship week"
3751,2020-12-27 06:14:11,kkozgj,Let’s beat Dallas but let’s root for the WFT also. I’ll take a 10-15 pick over a 22 any day of the week.
3752,2020-12-27 00:34:55,kkozgj,#How ‘Bout Them COWBOYS!
3753,2020-12-27 00:40:12,kkozgj,Mark my words tomorrow DEM BOYZ will start their road to 11-9 with a victory over the eagles.
3754,2020-12-27 00:54:14,kkozgj,I too agree. Beat Dallas!
3755,2020-12-27 03:24:31,kkozgj,No matter how the season goes I always wanna be able to say the cowboys suck with extra conviction.
3756,2020-12-27 04:19:54,kkozgj,"Exactly, there was only 1 top ten pick we didn't trade up in the draft for on our Super Bowl roster."
3757,2020-12-27 20:03:24,kkozgj,"For weeks now, I’ve been of the opinion that picking Top 5 helps the team better in the long-run that making the playoffs.  But I could never, under any circumstances, ever root for the Eagles to lose.  It’s just not in me as a fan.  I especially could never root for the Eagles to lose to the fucking *Cowboys*.  I want Hurts to put up 50+ on them."
3758,2020-12-27 21:25:12,kkozgj,The eagles have two paths to a successful season in my book. Playoffs and 2 wins against Dallas.

3760,2020-12-27 02:21:13,kkozgj,If Slay and Rodney played we win last week. That game just convinced me of it.
3761,2020-12-27 03:49:54,kkozgj,You can technically root for both. We don't control our own destiny. Root to win out and Washington beat the Panthers. Not saying I'm doing that. Just saying that you can technically root for both things.

3766,2020-12-27 00:38:30,kkozgj,There is one imposter among us
3767,2020-12-27 01:11:10,kkozgj,"Please specify which year? 

Been hearing this since Y2K"

3769,2020-12-27 17:45:17,kkozgj,"I mean there were only two guys on our roster that we picked in the top ten at all so that's not saying a lot, but I get your point."
3770,2020-12-26 20:17:17,kkozgj,Washington plays at 4 tomorrow
3771,2020-12-27 13:27:44,kkozgj,"nah, they'd have still torn us apart. Two players aren't changing 400 yards passing. Kingsbury might be worse than Doug as a playcaller"

sometimes they mean that, sometimes they also use a gendered pronouns to make it easier on cis people"
3775,2020-12-26 06:40:58,kkdueq,No it means the same. He is fine with either. He/they/him/them doesn't matter to him.
3776,2020-12-26 07:04:53,kkdueq,"Because they came out as transgender, non-binary. Which doesn't make a hole lot of since to me. If you're non-binary doesn't that mean you don't identify as male OR female, therefore you wouldn't need masculine or feminine pronouns?"
3777,2020-12-26 22:18:42,kkdueq,He means that he/him and they/them are both fine. He/they was just a shorter way of typing it out but has unfortunately caused some confusion.

3786,2020-12-25 17:29:09,kk2i3u,I don’t think it’s so much that “they want to be offended” but that they are finding themselves in uncomfortable situations and they aren’t sure how to go about it. Being a women and part of the LGBTQ community I’m sure Elliot has dealt with those micro aggressions. Elliot seems like a reasonable person and comes across as someone who would welcome those types of conversations (use of pronouns within the trans community). I would encourage your friend to talk to someone who is trans. If he doesn’t know anyone who is... invite him to Reddit 😉
