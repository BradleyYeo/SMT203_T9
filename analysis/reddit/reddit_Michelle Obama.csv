0,2020-02-05 13:21:09,ez3r4t,Michelle Obama has never been a politician and she’s said she does not want to become one.
1,2020-02-05 04:36:00,ez3r4t,"Ummm no.

Bloomberg's networth is 5x Trumps, his only interest would be in preserving his fortune which could have a massive impact on his policy. Michelle Obama is fine as a VP pick but honestly I wish people would stop these political dynasties and keep a good variety of people from varying backgrounds in politics."
2,2020-02-05 04:42:12,ez3r4t,"you ain't paying attention brother.  you should start or we're gonna lose.  Trump is bringing a streetfight and we gotta come correct.  we need Bloomberg's war chest to defeat Trump, he's more powerful than ever.  

also, his net worth is 10-11X Trump's.

his only interest is removing Donald Trump, that's what he's using his fortune on.

if Trump wins again, we'll be dealing with a Trump dynasty for generations.

Bloomberg is Dems only chance.  time to get real and suck it up.  winning is everything.

3,2020-02-05 04:45:45,ez3r4t,"Bloomberg has given away more than double Trumps net worth in the past decade. Bloomberg isn’t about preserving his own wealth, and the fact that he is funding his own campaign makes him a stronger candidate because he isn’t beholden to any special interest group."
4,2020-02-05 04:49:12,ez3r4t,"Idk Bloomberg seems like the typical candidate supported by the DMC...

Basically another figure head to preach change and do nothing.

I honestly feel like if this countries only choices are two megabillioners who ultimately will result in the same social and economic policies then it is already lost.

Trump is bad... Bloomberg is bad packaged good... what's the difference, without real change we don't even deserve to be the number one nation in the world...

The United States power is declining and we either change it and protect the populace or we end up pretty much like Russia... super rich 1% and the 99% in poverty living in slums with declining infrastructure.

Beating Trump means nothing if it isn't a massive shift in American Politics and the American people's standard of what a leader should be."
5,2020-02-05 05:02:29,ez3r4t,"In 2018 Bloomberg gave $1.8 billion to Johns Hopkins University his alma mater. Trumps estimated net “worth” at the time $1.8 billion. Coincidence, I think not."
6,2020-02-05 05:08:04,ez3r4t,"if only more people knew this, Trump would be gone"
7,2020-02-05 04:51:21,ez3r4t,"whoa that's dark. and uninformed.  i can't even...

dude: just vote."
8,2020-02-05 05:09:10,ez3r4t,>!on the next episode of 'Unsolved Mysteries'...!<
9,2020-02-05 05:09:11,ez3r4t,"The DNC made special changes so Bloomberg could even play... they saw the Biden ship sinking out of port and had to come up with a backup...

Honestly after 2016 I just don't trust the DNCs judgement.

And you say dark but a lot of high profile economist agree the United States years as a super power are reaching the end.... which isn't a bad thing, depending on how it is handled...

We need sturdy social safety nets to re-invent our economy as China becomes a bigger world player... just a fact of world economics. China and India are going to pass our GDP in the next 10 years and the world's standard currency which is USD will likely change which means the dollar will be hit with inflation due to over printing of the past 40 years to supply the world. When that happens we either have good policy or the wealth gap will only expand and companies will leave the US all together for other more financial stable countries."
10,2020-02-05 05:56:31,ez3r4t,"The DNC made the debate changes at the request of the other candidates who want Mike to debate. There was no special privileges for Mike. 

Also since when do economists determine who is/isn’t a superpower, which by definition is a military term. You are throwing out these broad claims about economics when even by your basic vernacular it is clear you really don’t know much  about the complexities of macroeconomics or foreign policy. 

All of that aside your argument has completely shifted away from anything having to do with Mike Bloomberg. I encourage you to go to mikebloomberg.com and read his plans for the economy, for job creation, for healthcare, for education reform and for pretty much any other policy.  Mike isn’t just some billionaire he has real executive experience as the mayor of americas largest and most diverse city."
11,2020-02-05 05:15:34,ez3r4t,"on DNC debates issue: he still isn't qualified yet.  they doubled the polling % threshold even though got rid of donor threshold.  pay attention.  anyways, even if you don't ""trust the DNC"" we still have to get behind the only person who can beat Trump.  there hasn't been leadership at the DNC since Obama era, that ain't Bloombergs fault.

as far as policy, this election won't be won on policy.  you don't beat Trump by having better policies than him (although Bloom does).  make no mistake: this is a referendum on Trump.  that's is the absolute primary focus.  and when you go into battle, you need a general, not a poet, or a career politician, or a socialist.  you need someone who knows how to swing a blade and take down an adversary.  because that's what Trump's coming with.  we can pretend that isn't true, or wish that weren't true, but that's exactly why Trump wins.

Dems need to quit voting based on policy and start voting on what can win."
12,2020-02-05 06:08:31,ez3r4t,"""A superpower is a state with a dominant position characterized by its extensive ability to exert influence or project power on a global scale. This is done through the combined-means of economic, military, technological and cultural strength as well as diplomatic and soft power influence.""

Military is only a small part of being a superpower and in today's world economy is a much larger factor. China is trying to break away from American market control with more Chinese counterparts like Alibaba etc.

Economists don't decide anything, only point to the signs of the united states economic influence over the world dwindling... and when you don't have as much cashflow funding your massive billion dollar military becomes hard.

But yes, I will read into Bloomberg. I have been more or less out of the loop until recently because Trump has left a distaste for anything political for the last 4 years."
13,2020-02-05 05:22:18,ez3r4t,"So.... become Republicans.... there's a reason they all tow party lines and it's because Democrats handed it to them for years.... so they sold out morality for the W.

The escalation of the American political machine is a very boring one. I will vote Bloomberg to prevent a Trump second term but I disagree in the sense that it will help the nation in the long run...

It's like the quick fix instead of addressing the core issue.... the core issue is that the POLICY should be the only thing that matters in politics."

They go to places like here, 14.25 km from Taal post their selfies about how heroic they are but when you give your input to them, they thumb their noses at you seemingly condescending like - like they know how it is to really solve people's problems in a locality?

Then they pester social media with donations - so they can keep looking like ""heroes"" and ""good people"".

Yan ang problema kung minsan ng mga edukado, they really do feel ""superior"" in how they manage things.

Not to downgrade education, education is important - but experience and insider knowledge are more valuable.

Pupunta ka sa isang lugar na hindi mo kilala ang mga lokal, tapos magpopost ka sa social media na kailangan mo ng donasyon para ikaw ang mamahagi?

**Narinig na namin yan.**

It reminds me of a Pastor who almost bought our land here. 

He wanted to put up a Christian school. He would be funded by sponsors from abroad. During negotiations, the Pastor then asked, ""Magkano ang sa akin?""

I was speechless. 

Kailangan daw niya kasi ng pambayad sa monthly nung bagong kotse niya.

Since then, I've been wary of ""charitable"" individuals on social media. 

Ma'am kung talagang tutulong ka, shut the fuck up and stop blabbering on social media, and posting selfies about your good works.

I just told them the truth, kako ayaw ko na sa work wla ako natututunan and feeling ko wla yung trabaho sa gusto kong gawin down the line. Wla na din naman sila nagawa, hindi naman ako inipit or anything like that.

Besides that yung applications ko after is pang entry level ulit, syempre aminado naman ako na wla akong napapanghawakan na experience pa. Though yung nkakuha sakin eventually tinanong pa din nila, and luckily na consider nila yun 6+1 month ko."

Anyway pwede naman low carb instead of keto kasi grabe ang oil and fats sa keto. From keto nag shift ako sa low carb dati kasi di aki mahilg sa fatty and oily food.

Good luck sayo! Kaya yan. 🙂"

432,2020-02-04 05:09:19,eyc8yu,Between him and Zack I think that the show has not done their job of vetting participants very well.  These two narcissist douchebags are complete losers.
433,2020-02-04 02:54:28,eyc8yu,You don’t take your ring off for that BS reason he gave. You take your ring off because you want to still be single. Or you’re old like me and arthritis (or some other condition) prevents wearing it— and even then I have a beautiful necklace with both our names/birthstones on it that I wear instead.
434,2020-02-04 08:11:08,eyc8yu,Does “he wants a Hillary and you’re a Michelle” mean that Michael doesn’t want to be with a black woman? Or do you mean he wants to be with someone who will deal with his bs and put on a good face for the public? Because I’m definitely getting a vibe that both options are true for him!
435,2020-02-04 22:54:32,eyc8yu,[deleted]
436,2020-02-05 22:58:27,eyc8yu,I mean the producers are doing very well. The point of this show is to make money not actually match couples. They need couples with enough chemistry to make it most episodes but not too good a match that there is no drama...
437,2020-02-05 05:51:20,eyc8yu,"Btw, u can get ur ring adapted w/ a hinge closure so u can wear it w/ arthritis. It works really well"
438,2020-02-06 18:36:05,eyc8yu,yea he's being an ass.
439,2020-02-06 18:34:01,eyc8yu,"Not about race. Its about someone who will have that type of relationship with. He would always say things like ""Im Bill and I need you to be Hillary"" when we were dating. I shut that down quick."
440,2020-02-06 18:35:33,eyc8yu,That may be so but at 33 Mike shouldnt be doing stuff that he did in college and I have yet to see that he's grown any since he was 23.
441,2020-02-05 22:59:04,eyc8yu,Lol you're in the wrong sub. This sub is only for feeling sorry for the women and hating the men on the show.
442,2020-02-08 03:36:44,eyc8yu,Thank you SO much! Will look in to that!!
443,2020-02-06 18:37:32,eyc8yu,"Nah I gave him the chance to prove that he had grown from when we dated and even defended him, but he showed his ass like always."
444,2020-02-06 18:51:28,eyc8yu,"I by no means think all these guys are awesome. But due to past terrible males on this show this sub seems to automatically assume all guys are terrible and give the ladies a pass. Just look at all the comments about Beth and Jamie. Jamie wasnt a great guy but the level of abuse she was willing to show on TV let alone when the cameras werent rolling was crazy. And yet this sub defended her like she was completely innocent. I get reddit is dominated by women even more so from this sub, but jeez men arent automatically guilty nore are the women"
445,2020-02-07 14:07:49,eyc8yu,"I agree with you completely about seeing both things equally. That’s the main reason why the title of the post is what it is. However this post is far from what you’re insinuating it to be. 

You can see in many other post I have written that I believe Meka has a lot of growing to do but she is 25 and is acting like a 25 year old. 

But I can’t ignore Michaels behavior just because she is immature. After all what’s worse a 25 year old who acts their age or a 33 year old that is acting like he did when he was 22.  That’s the problem I have with him. I personally know he can do better. 

Relationships take 2 (or more if you’re into that lol) so both sides have to work on their maturity. 

This is my first time watching this show so I don’t know anything about the couple you mentioned and have nothing to compare it too 

In fact the only reason I’m watching is because I personally know Michael and I joined the sub to do my part and make sure his real personality didn’t  got lost in the edits especially as a black man. 

I still consider him one of the homies, but what kind of friend would I be if I didn’t call out his bs and tried to help him be a better person."
446,2020-02-03 19:42:57,eyapx7,Well apparently this country don't stand for shit... The gutters are lined with the piss and puke of homeless vets.

449,2020-02-04 01:16:55,eyapx7,The affront is having soldiers go over seas fighting offensive wars for imperialists
450,2020-02-04 00:48:55,eyapx7,Let's be real. No one should be homeless. Not just the veterans. Let's cut our military budget in half ( then we'd still be spending more than ever other country) and let's find people some homes.
451,2020-02-04 00:53:15,eyapx7,"I like how she wants to be all inclusive-like, but it's men who are the large majority of soldiers, and it's men who the large majority of homeless."

453,2020-02-04 03:37:05,eyapx7,"According to our politician's actions, not their words, raising the taxes of billionaires to keep our veterans from being homeless is an affront to everything this country has come to stand for."
454,2020-02-03 18:39:35,eyapx7,The affront is that they joined in the first place.
455,2020-02-03 21:18:59,eyapx7,Unless they got court-marshalled.

What if they need groceries and walk too the store?"
457,2020-02-03 20:08:19,eyapx7,As a African who has never been to America I was really shocked to hear how prevalent it is and that a large portion of the homeless are veterans. It's really heartbreaking.
458,2020-02-03 20:08:46,eyapx7,Why is that do you think?
459,2020-02-04 09:30:53,eyapx7,"$738,000,000,000 yearly defense budget. Hard to take care of the troops when the money is so tight. Can only spend 84 million per hour, needs to be rationed for important things."
460,2020-02-03 20:11:54,eyapx7,The affront is that you need an education.
461,2020-02-04 00:32:11,eyapx7,Or court-martial even
462,2020-02-03 20:35:39,eyapx7,You can't find it within yourself to help our veterans accomplish these small feats?
463,2020-02-03 20:42:59,eyapx7,Large portion of suicides are veterans as well. 22 veterans kill themselves everyday
464,2020-02-03 21:33:14,eyapx7,I think it's like 11% of homeless people are veterans which is 11% too many but not nearly the numbers REDDIT would have you thinking. That % comes from the national coalition for homeless veterans btw.
465,2020-02-03 22:48:14,eyapx7,"Because Military and Civilian culture are so radically different that they can't adjust to transitioning. Especially if combat deployments take part.

Military is considerably close-knit (at least in the Infantry world *ideally*) where you work with a very select group all working to the common goal, whether you're a fuzzy E1 who enlisted straight out of high school or a ~~Unicorn~~ Warrant Officer making sure everything's running as it should.

In the Civilian side of things you're more self-reliant for the most part. No chain of command (at least not to the same degree), no camaraderie (which is a huge driving factor for reenlistment), etc.

Couple that with stuff like PTSD and difficulty getting a job and you get lots of homeless vets.

I'm currently in a program (SFL-TAP) which helps Soldiers transition, but it can only do so much you know?"
466,2020-02-03 21:36:44,eyapx7,Because they're predominately men. Our country is too busy listening to fat women complain about their lack of fair media representation to care about what happens to men.
467,2020-02-03 20:16:11,eyapx7,No - you do. Warmonger.
468,2020-02-03 20:42:43,eyapx7,no
469,2020-02-03 20:43:57,eyapx7,"Most of the people that sign up dont step foot on a battle field. They go because they're told they can get their college paid, and have benefits."
470,2020-02-03 21:23:28,eyapx7,And this excuses their choice? Or that they were put in this situation in the first place?
471,2020-02-03 21:43:56,eyapx7,"You try being in a piss poor place where you cant get a good paying job, where the military is your only option practically. Not everyone has college smarts, and is able to get a well paying job with only a high school degree. When the military pays well enough to live off of, offers college for the capable, and other benefits then people are gonna sign up. How is it considered a choice when it seems like the only choice?"
472,2020-02-04 12:46:48,eyapx7,"Maybe the socio-economic backgrounds of the people who join plays a role in the decision? You'll notice that there is a negative correlation between the strength of the economy and enlistment rates.

Pull your head out of your ass, you privleged fuck."
473,2020-02-03 21:46:05,eyapx7,"So instead of questioning why they go to war, you make an excuse for it. Gotcha. 

And you don't see that the situation is an affront?

What exactly are you trying to say? You seem confused."
474,2020-02-04 18:56:45,eyapx7,So change the system instead of defending it. You’re a very confused person.
475,2020-02-03 22:27:45,eyapx7,"I'm saying dont blame the average Joe's that go to the military, blame the higher ups in power for waging them. If noone signed up for war there would just be abl draft. If those in power want a war they will wage it one way or another"
476,2020-02-04 19:14:11,eyapx7,"Again your comment shows you can't see past your privilege. Having the resources and capability to make that kind of change is not inherent, especially in populations that are likely to join the military or that are homeless. 

Sounds like you're the confused one here."
477,2020-02-03 23:07:32,eyapx7,"They don't need to join - they are just too young to know what they are signing up for. I wasn't blaming the average Joe, I'm saying that if you want things to change, you need to stop making excuses for the higher-ups in power - you're doing their job for them."
478,2020-02-04 19:23:41,eyapx7,"You’re assuming I’m privileged because that’s what you want to think. You’re ignoring that the US military is a predatory force that preys on vulnerable young men. And you’re ignoring anything I propose about finding a new solution 

So I assume you’re just here to argue. 

Have a nice day."
479,2020-02-03 23:20:46,eyapx7,I'm not making a single excuse for those in power at all. I hold then accountable entirely for every single senseless war that is waged. I'm defending the citizens that sign up because you're attacking them saying they're warmongers.
480,2020-02-04 20:22:44,eyapx7,"""The affront is that they joined in the first place.""

You blame the people joining and in this comment you blame the predatory system that feeds the military. So which is it? Don't try to play some white knight now.You can't even keep your ""arguement"" straight.

You didn't provide a solution and you were just attacking the people who join. 

I can tell you're privleged because you can't even obfuscate it enough to not come through in your comments."
481,2020-02-03 23:31:52,eyapx7,"They're warmongers because they join the military. This may be because they think it's the only available option - but it isn't, and it's certainly not worth killing people for a paycheck, no matter what the pretence to do it is. 

If you want to defend the citizens, then push for alternative education that teaches vulnerable young adults about their options before the military recruiters can get to them. 

Meanwhile - it's important to not glorify war. It's important to push the message that joining the military will not make you 'cool', 'manly' or a 'hero' and neither will you be serving your country - no matter what the military wants you to think. 

It's simple logic. You are either on the side of the military, and want to encourage young people to go to war by telling them there is nothing wrong in doing so, or you are on the side of these young men and you are telling them that there are better options. 

So far you have said the contrary - and made the excuse that it's ok to go to war, and that they have no other choice. 

So ...whose side are you on?"
482,2020-02-04 20:45:47,eyapx7,"Where did I blame them in that sentence? The only crime they commit is being young and stupid.

Stop projecting for a second and you’ll be able to see things a little clearer."
483,2020-02-04 01:30:21,eyapx7,"No. That logic is bullshit, there is no such thing as a 'this side or that side' situation. This isnt a with us or against us thing. And where have I made the excuse that it's okay to go to war? Where did I even remotely imply that? 
Heres my view:


You wont ever understand how little opportunities there are when you're so poor you cant afford college, and you cant find a good enough paying job to live off of on a high school Diploma. So these guys apply to go to the military because they pay for college, benefits, and you can even learn some trades as well. It's the only option for some people. You wont ever understand because you dont come from the bottom 1% of the population. Until you understand that there are 8 year old children going 4 days without food, and then they turn 18 and realize theres a chance for them to earn a living and have college paid for them, something they never thought they'd get to do because they're poor, they jump at that chance. 

I hate war, it's violent and senseless, but I want to add that we are at the least amount of wars, and are in the safest times of our lives in over 50 years. 

1% of the population of the U.S joins the military, 1% of the military is combat arms, and 10% of the combat arms ever see combat. 

You may think we are just at constant war or something, but it's way lower than you think.  I really hope you can open your mind a little and try to emphasize with the bottom 1% of America because it's mostly that bottom 1% that is in the military. Try and see it from their side. I know you think there are more options for work or whatever. If you think that, then I want you in your next job hunt to only say you have a highschool degree, no trades, no experience, and you come from a place that is well known for being a shithole. Because if you think the location you come from doesnt affect applications as well, it does."
484,2020-02-04 01:47:12,eyapx7,"”warmonger
/ˈwɔːmʌŋɡə/
noun
a person who encourages or advocates aggression towards other countries or groups.”

A soldier is not necessary a warmonger. Don't throw around such serious accusations so poorly. One of my mates is in the British Air Force and is regularly deployed to Africa to work as an anti-poaching unit. If you're honestly going to blanket an entire group of people as less than then you can take it and shove it. People lay down their lives so  privileged morons like you can whine and complain about your easy life. Shut up and go get a decent education before you bitch to the world about your misinformed opinions."
485,2020-02-04 02:21:16,eyapx7,"A soldier actively and willingly  participates in this. They form part of the Military Industrial complex.

It’s important that you educate yourself on these matters."
486,2020-02-04 08:48:11,eyapx7,In the meantime you don't seem to want to educate yourself. /u/WWWeast's last post is a real eye opener - for those who want to see.
487,2020-02-04 09:27:10,eyapx7,In what way haven't I acknowledged what they have said? It's besides the point.

489,2020-02-04 09:37:44,eyapx7,"It's a double-edged-sword. When you're 18 you don't know any better. You certainly don't know that there are other options. And there are. 

Education, as I said, is something that helps here."

The Nobel Peace Prize website states,  ""for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples.""

What a load of bs.  Like reducing tensions for Israel?  Like reducing tensions for the people of Ferguson, MO.  Or Baltimore, MD?  He is an appeaser who gave our enemy millions.

He could have very well been THE GUY to end race problems in America.  But instead he chose to incite them.   And that is only one of the problems I have with that man."

504,2020-02-03 07:47:24,exzp25,Sure. I used to vote Left and did switch to Trump. Because the Left feels irreal. I know in an ideal world they are right ( ideal) but in a world where there are tyrants and terrorists we must have a crazy person at the top because otherwise the crazy enemy does not have any fears from us. I mean from the US. I am in the ex Soviet EU. We know here how ideal ideas turn into a police terror state's PR lies.

505,2020-02-03 08:11:48,exzp25,"From the Bernie (or Yang, or the collection of more minor candidates like Booker or Harris) supporters' perspective, the DNC has been doing some stuff that's shady as hell -- just like 2016, but they *noticed* this time because Queen I-have-a-vagina isn't there to unite them behind a common cause.

The DNC sees themselves as kingmaker. They decide, ultimately, who runs (although they accept some limited feedback), and those too far outside their Overton window don't get to play.

As long as voters remain ""reliable, party line voting bloc"", that doesn't change.

Hillary would have **easily** won against Romney or Rubio or 2016-era-Cruz or most any of the empty suits that made up the Republican field against Trump at the time, because the RNC doesn't do the same thing.

If in 2024, the RNC pulled the kind of stuff that they're pulling against people like Tulsi, Yang, Bernie, and so on, and tried to force Mitt Romney down our throats, manipulating polls, setting up superdelegate systems to manipulate tallies reported, and changing the rules mid-game to make sure that they don't get to show up to debates... I'm not going to go out and vote for Mitt unless the Democrats run **literal** Satan.

I can imagine the Democrats in that group are feeling much the same. Maybe they won't vote for Trump. Maybe they will. But they aren't going to just accept the candidate their party shoves down their throat with a smile."

I think it's far more probable that the DNC cheats Bernie again and some quantity of his supporters vote for Trump out of spite (or take the blinders off and realize Trump is actually delivering on his promises to help the working class).

Working class & particularly rust belt voters will be key to 2020 just as it was in 2016.  Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are must-keeps."

When a major party starts acknowledging fringe groups and allowing them to drive its platform, the less effective it can govern or effectively gain support from the populace as the divisions internally outweigh the commonalities. The opposing party thus bends toward populist positions and  common sense and wins a significant amount of disillusioned voters. The extremist party will be forced to bend back towards the middle in order to remain relevant."

I wouldn't be surprised if something similar happens with the Dems. They'll go full blown socialism. Obama already planted the seeds. They'll be some outliers, but the majority will follow.  Today's youth had been indoctrinated to believe the American dream is dead, and the government should step in to pay for things. The promise of free shit is a powerful carrot to dangle in front of people. Hope I'm wrong, but we'll see."

My theory is if one has money and refuses to get  married one will like the USA, if not Europe is a much better place to live due to socialism. There are arguments that socialism stifles innovation but well there is also a utilitarian view that more people are much happier on socialism. why should most of the population work 3 jobs and have no social life to push the nation forward?  :)

530,2020-02-03 23:05:19,exzp25,I actually liked most of the candidates the rnc ran in 2016. I wouldn't call them empty suits. And that does take away from Trump's accomplishment.
531,2020-02-03 15:57:16,exzp25,"I tend to swing a bit even though I identify as more conservative socially in my private life, and like Republican economic policies more.  Balance isn't my absolute top focus, but it certainly is up there in my thought process.  It's one of the reasons I was able to justify supporting Bernie in 16 until he lost the primary. In my reasoning, the executive can't do things like nationalize industries without being checked by both the legislature and judiciary.  Even more so if the party in the legislature is opposing the executive. So him being a 'socialist' wasn't a big fear of mine. And things like his anti-immigration, trade, anti war stances were big draws for me. Especially since I wasn't a big fan of the Paul Ryan republican party.

Obviously when he bent the knee I reevaluated my choices and went Trump for trade, immigration, anti unnecessary war, etc. Him being an outsider and catching so much flak from 'Never Trumpers' like the establishment Republicans that I really disliked certainly helped also.  In 18 I was thinking about voting Dem again to balance out the power, but I just couldn't with how crazy the Dems are getting lately.  That said, I can easily see how someone could reason that voting D still made sense if they prioritized balancing power in branches a little more than I did."
532,2020-02-03 14:12:29,exzp25,It's a 2 party system. They won't do it unless they would rather let Trump win just to make a point to moderate Dems.

Reddit would like you to believe every other person is a closet socialist but that's far from true. The Democrat pay boots are wealthier than Republicans on average. Your not gonna see elites or middle age and older voters vote for a socialist that wants to tax the shit out of them. They aren't bout to trust a Bernie presidency with their 401ks.

Thomas Sowell is right, diversity is a made up word that pushes racism. The son of the black doctor in Malibu is now treated differently based on his skin color compared to the son of the white doctor in Malibu next door. Even tho they grew up in exactly the same area. To a liberal, they only see race and then judge them based on that color.

The Clinton campaign had complete control over the DNC and used its infrastructure to benefit her election in a dozen different ways, which we can get into. And it’s not a hyperbole, the DNC was quite simply out of cash, then Clinton came in, and in exchange of an infusion of money, she and her allies were given all the leadership roles. Debbie-Schultz(spelling?) for example. Donna Brazille(also spelling?) confirmed all of this in her damn book a couple years ago."

Exercising regularly and taking time to spend by myself, preferably walking through nature, helps a lot. It helps me to remember that my life is also for me."
634,2020-01-30 12:08:24,evuktl,"Accomplishments can be so important. I had a really difficult experience in college, and I was feeling extremely down about it right up until the point where they started getting close to calling my name at graduation. It just hit me all of a sudden that *I have an education*, and nobody can take that away from me. I felt like so many things had been taken from me across the course of my life. But this was something no one could steal, or break, or dismiss. It was mine. 

Don't let anyone make you feel diminished. You have a treasure trove they can't raid. Your accomplishments belong to you, and no one else. Nobody gets to decide their worth - and your worth - except you."

I don't think real beauty can be influenced by the media. I think conventional attractiveness is, but that's constantly changing as well. Lust sometimes accompanies beauty but is in no way the same thing. Beauty is so much deeper than that, and it stems from within."

639,2020-01-29 15:59:50,evo1ag,"You are your own problem here. You’re saying without saying that you think there is something wrong with him for not seeing the world exactly the same way you do.

I have a lot of people I love deeply despite the fact that they see things that are very important to me very differently. Sometimes we discuss it with the goal of exploring the other ones thoughts and feelings in an effort to seek respectful understanding and reflect on our own views.

If you respected him, including a belief that he is a person whose views are just as valid as your own, exploring your differences would be an exciting adventure, maybe even an opportunity to better develop your own world view. It sounds like you’re closed minded and narcissistic."
640,2020-01-29 15:52:04,evo1ag,"He’s just a product of his environment. Look at it that way. Over time, you can subtly show him the flaws/ignorance in his views and hopefully he’ll soften on some his positions. If not, just try not to discuss it, but I don’t think you should throw it away if you really like him. My mom is a God fearing Christian and my dad is a staunch atheist and they’ve been married for 36 years."
641,2020-01-29 16:11:23,evo1ag,"Thanks, I really do appreciate your advice, which is what I came for. The thing is, the “relationship”
or romance or intimate connection, that’s been this force that wants to grow. We vibe, we enjoy each other, we have boundless chemistry. But, chemistry won’t get us too far for too long, compatibility will start kicking in and the sooner I pull the plug the easier. 

I’ll have to admit, I came here hoping for some positive feedback and advice on how it can work, but in reality I know that’s wishful thinking. I’ll 10,000 angels to help me disassemble this, but you’re right. Thanks again,  best to you."
642,2020-01-29 15:40:53,evo1ag,"Well, yes. I like him because he’s nice to me and he is hot. I also think he’s a good person, albeit misguided. We have similar lifestyles as far as the hobbies/time spent outside of work is concerned. It’s like, I love hiking and so does he, but he brings a gun and I’m like you better not. His energy is super smilie/clear/transparent and he doesn’t seem all damaged and hateful towards exes. He’s a hard worker too, and an outdoors type like me. If we make it three months, I’ll probably put us in therapy to navigate, because you’re right, I can’t go a lifetime without talking about those things"
643,2020-01-29 15:46:48,evo1ag,"You're trying to convince yourself you might be able to ""fix"" his political and religious beliefs. Or that's how it sounds to me. Long term relationship are full of compromise already without having to deal with something so fundamental to a persons identity."
644,2020-01-29 15:56:04,evo1ag,"I think you ought to be too mature to still be choosing to date men you know are “misguided” in their core beliefs about humanity.

After all your bad experiences, why continue to settle for something that’s not right?  The REASON that things aren’t right here is different than the reasons things weren’t right with other guys, but that doesn’t make it ok."
645,2020-01-29 15:56:52,evo1ag,"Fix or change? No. I actually appreciate those who’ve found god and are true to their convictions. And he is the only one who’s mentioned that he’s going to change some of my stances on things and “concert me”.  Which I laughed at.  

I suppose, I run a hard line on Karma everyday. I actively work on being a responsible, clear conscience person whole heartedly. So, fundamentally there I don’t see a problem. If we’re both good people. Do politics make us fundamentally who we are though?"
646,2020-01-29 16:06:27,evo1ag,I appreciate your response and your choice of words. I think you’re precisely correct and laid it out clearly for me to understand.
647,2020-01-29 16:04:24,evo1ag,"Look I'm not going to disrespect your intelligence by repeating myself as if you can't read, but I'll make a couple more observations. This statement:

>Fix or change? No.

Is at odds with this:

>  If we make it three months, I’ll probably put us in therapy to navigate

Three months in you would go to group therapy to 'navigate?' This sounds delusional to me. 

>Do politics make us fundamentally who we are though?

I would say yes, unless neither of you actually hold strong opinions about anything. It's good to be open to differences of opinion and be around people with opinions that aren't your own, that doesn't mean it's a good idea to try to ram a romantic relationship through that barrier."
648,2020-01-29 16:28:03,evo1ag,"You’re welcome.  Also ask yourself - are you taking away too much of his agency?  

What if you overheard HIM saying that about YOU - that your beliefs are just a product of your environment, at 36, that you’re basically still just an ignorant child who was spoon fed the wrong ideas and blindly accepted them all this time, and with the right teacher, your warped mindset can be cured? Wouldn’t you be terribly insulted? Why would you want to be with someone who thought so little of your intelligence? Would you want to be with someone who didn’t respect you as a mature adult in that way?"
649,2020-01-29 21:45:32,evo1ag,"I’m not sure you had to go on and on and I’m not sure you had to name call. But, I do respect him. For sure."
650,2020-01-29 22:09:03,evo1ag,I’m asking you if you’re name-calling him as “misguided” (code for “ignorant”) - spoiler alert - you are - and to imagine how you’d feel if he name-called you the same way.

This means mass awwests and we know this is going to happen wowwdwide, so they needed a covew to westwict twavew and get peopwe pwepawed to have an intewwuption in suppwies whiwe a financiaw weset and the awwests occuw. Pwesident Twump is twying to teww Amewicans to be pwepawed undew the guise of a pandemic. 

The stock mawket needs to adjust down in owdew to do a compwete weset and move us to a gowd backed cuwwency and get wid of the Fed. The stock mawket has been fawsewy infwated fow awhiwe. The CV is the pewfect “cwisis” to make a wot of it wowk. Twavew wiww wikewy shut down fow a bwief pewiod and maybe aww schoows and univewsities wiww be shut down so kids awe home safe with theiw pawents when the awwests occuw.

Having the CV cwisis awwows POTUS to shut down ouw bowdews so Homewand Secuwity and ouw miwitawy can focus on keeping peace. Awso, POTUS said evewything with the CV wiww be ovew in Apwiw. He said it because he knows it is a fake panic and they pwan to take action in Mawch and by Apwiw, the Amewican pubwic wiww be infowmed of what has occuwwed and why.

India had a fuww on cewebwation when POTUS visited. It is because he has stwuck a deaw with India to stawt pwoducing many of the things we wewe having China pwoduce cheapwy and it wiww hewp India A WOT. I think China’s weadew is in on it with Twump, possibwy. When Twump visited China, he took him to the Fowbidden City and this has nevew been done with anothew wowwd weadew; wikewy to have compwete pwivacy to pwan.

I bewieve it is aww an act to take them out of DC and awwow them to fwy undew the wadaw so they couwd be at Gitmo and the othew base to get evewything set up fow the miwitawy twibunaws.

Twump has wepwaced many of the Obama judges and othews who wouwd not do the wight thing when the mass awwests occuw. That took a wong time to get them confiwmed and pwaced stwategicawwy whewe they wiww be needed. He has the majowity of the SCOTUS.

658,2020-03-27 17:16:07,fq10vs,"ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! A MUST READ!!!!!! 💥💥💥⛈⛈⛈

Q has posted today stating it’s “go time”. My friend is an Army vet and he said “Rig for Red” meant they had to changeover to their red lights on their gun sights and equipment right before attacking the enemy, so the enemy wouldn’t see them coming. 

This means mass arrests and we know this is going to happen worldwide, so they needed a cover to restrict travel and get people prepared to have an interruption in supplies while a financial reset and the arrests occur. President Trump is trying to tell Americans to be prepared under the guise of a pandemic. 

The stock market needs to adjust down in order to do a complete reset and move us to a gold backed currency and get rid of the Fed. The stock market has been falsely inflated for awhile. The CV is the perfect “crisis” to make a lot of it work. Travel will likely shut down for a brief period and maybe all schools and universities will be shut down so kids are home safe with their parents when the arrests occur. We could even have a period of Marital Law to suppress opportunities for looting and riots.

[Keeping people away from large crowds minimizes false flags, mass shootings, or other catastrophic events.  Can't have a school shooting if the kids aren't in school. - M]

Having the CV crisis allows POTUS to shut down our borders so Homeland Security and our military can focus on keeping peace. Also, POTUS said everything with the CV will be over in April. He said it because he knows it is a fake panic and they plan to take action in March and by April, the American public will be informed of what has occurred and why.

India had a full on celebration when POTUS visited. It is because he has struck a deal with India to start producing many of the things we were having China produce cheaply and it will help India A LOT. I think China’s leader is in on it with Trump, possibly. When Trump visited China, he took him to the Forbidden City and this has never been done with another world leader; likely to have complete privacy to plan. China has a Deep State, too, that is teamed up with our CIA and Deep State bad actors; the Clintons, Bidens, Romney, Feinstein and others.

Doug Collins, Matt Gaetz, Ted Cruz, Mike Pence, Mike Pompeo and Mark Meadows were all supposedly exposed to CV. What better way to explain their upcoming absence in DC than quarantine at their homes? Q already told us when the mass arrests happen, POTUS will be safely out of the country. AF1 can fly continuously, if needed, because it can be refueled in the air. President Trump is taking his present and future cabinet members with him in AF1 to keep them out of harm’s way and it won’t alert anyone that he is taking them all with! He already announced Mark Meadows will be his new Chief of Staff.

The “quarantine centers” have all been set up in areas where the concentration of sealed indictments are the highest. This explains why there is barbed wire slanted inward at one I saw in a video. These will be detention centers for the many criminals and traitors. They may even be set up as prisons with the sheer number of them. 

Gitmo has had a multi-million $ upgrade that is completed. A new head judge has been sent to Gitmo. There was a large amount of our troops sent to Gitmo for a 2 year assignment last Summer. There were $millions spent just upgrading the Justice buildings and lawyer offices at Gitmo and another military base in the US.

I truly believe Trump, Gen Kelly and Gen Mattis are not on bad terms. I believe it is all an act to take them out of DC and allow them to fly under the radar so they could be at Gitmo and the other base to get everything set up for the military tribunals. The same goes for Sessions; he knows all of it because he was AG while the investigations were occurring and sealed indictments were ramping up. He likely recused himself from the Russia investigation to be able to focus on the other investigations and sealed indictments. He supposedly left on bad terms with POTUS, but I’ll bet he’s been working under the radar since he left DC to get everything ready.

Trump has replaced many of the Obama judges and others who would not do the right thing when the mass arrests occur. That took a long time to get them confirmed and placed strategically where they will be needed. He has the majority of the SCOTUS. Justice Roberts is highly compromised and will either be replaced with another Conservative Justice or has been given a deal to go along with ruling against any attempts to stop justice being served to the criminals and traitors in our government.

There have been a lot of National Guard and military equipment movement under the guise of a State of Emergency for the CV. They are getting into place to help deal with any civil unrest that will occur when people freak out over the arrests or groups like ANTIFA try to start problems because they have been paid by Soros to do so.

The internet, or at least all social media, will likely go dark, so don’t panic if it happens. It won’t be forever. They tested taking down specific platforms and cell service a couple of times. The CIA’s satellites have been shut down, so they have been blinded. I find it interesting, also, that Gina Haspel was at the last SOTU address smiling ear to ear. CIA directors rarely, if ever, attend SOTU addresses.

The Queen of England was locked out of Windsor Castle, briefly on Friday, for the first time ever. It was a marker to tell those following Q that it’s time.

A Q post from September of 2018 read:

Trump wore a bright yellow tie in India and today at the CV press conference. He is telling us there is no virus threat because it is the exact same color as the maritime flag that represents the vessel has no infected people on board. Every state reporting the most cases and deaths are all Sanctuary States run by Democrat bad actors in an attempt to get funding for the virus since Trump has cut off any Federal funds for Sanctuary States.

Do you see it now??

Trump and Pence have been flying all over, attending group events, hugging people, shaking hands... They are not worried because the Cvirus panic is fake

-Be ready for Martial Law

I found myself cheering along for passage of the bills, even though I know they’ve long since been enacted."

We are in desperate need of a cohesive, united coalition comprised of different groups and unions all working towards common goals for the greater good.

#streamTimeMachine"
699,2020-03-25 11:25:40,fon9cd,"its just a peak example of celebs making a generic statement of hope and positivity when they have the means to more directly make a positive impact on the community or on people's lives during this time and (in the case of a lot of these celebs) are not doing anything, which makes it look like cheap activism more about the image of caring rather than about any sort of actual interest in helping the people struggling right now.

It also doesn't help that Imagine is an embarrassingly overused song that a lot of people online think is overrated these days and the cover wasn't pleasant to hear either"
700,2020-03-25 12:04:14,fon9cd,"There's a few reasons really.

First of all, (and it's not really their fault, given that it was John Lennon who sang it) it's a song whose lyrics don't really fit the people singing it, or indeed the person who wrote it (Elton John famously took the piss out of it and sent the re-written lyrics to John Lennon as a joke).

It's a bit tone-deaf (in more ways than one), because we're in the middle of a global pandemic, a time of national and global crisis and we have a bunch of celebs singing a song to us as if it helps matters, which it doesn't, especially when some of them could easily help the efforts to prevent this kind of thing. I don't go in for this whole ""eat the rich"" redistribution of wealth rubbish everyone is coming out with, but celebs can be doing more than they're doing. It just comes off a bit patronising. 

Good God, agree on a fucking key! I can't sing for shit, but I don't sing into my camera and put it on Twitter, so seeing a bunch of people sing a song really badly, really out of key and really out of time, is just excruciating. 

It looked like a bit of a chance to flex as well, as in ""Look how sick my home is while I sing"". It was also ruined by some celebs just totally ruining it by belting it out as if they're playing the X Factor final and it looks desperate.

All in all, it looked like one of those generic statements that people made to try and earn some internet brownie points. It came off really condescending and while the intention behind it was obviously very good, it just looked bad and had the air of ""you don't really know what's going on here, do you?"" about it. If you're someone who's having to use food banks, or live off coupons or have just been laid-off or are having to use the government scheme to get paid, being sung ""Imagine"" by Gal Gadot and a few of her mates, would really boil your piss because they haven't got to cope with anything like that.

That and ""Imagine"" really isn't as good as everyone pretends it is."

707,2020-03-25 20:29:57,fon9cd,"Listen, as a Brit, I know all too well how good The Beatles really were and just how much of an impact they've had and I love their music, but really and truly, that song is kind of remembered how it is because it was written by one of the guys from The Beatles.

It's a good song, don't get me wrong, but people put it up on this pedestal as being the ""be all and end all"" of lyrical composition, but let's not forget that it is a pretty contradictory song, it hasn't really aged very well and it's nowhere near as good as his other songs."

763,2020-04-24 01:19:22,g5gplt,"Why do people in America have so little respect for people like Vice President Biden who yes, is old. However, with age comes experience and wisdom. America seems to be one of the only nations who allowed an entire generation to grow to adulthood while holding all elders in disdain and mockery.  It's quite sad really."
764,2020-04-26 18:32:13,g5gplt,"Great choice. A woman who, by her own admission, has never been proud to be an American."
765,2020-04-21 19:59:44,g5gplt,I don’t think he will. She doesn’t want it and she doesn’t have the experience for it. It’s just him giving a compliment.
766,2020-04-21 20:20:13,g5gplt,Beats being a bankrupt reality tv show host.
767,2020-04-23 12:03:51,g5gplt,As opposed to what's happening now???!!!!
768,2020-04-23 12:03:03,g5gplt,"At this point and time in history, it's in no way, shape or form a token.  It's a demand by a minority that's fast becoming one of 2 majorities while caucasians become the minority. It's time there was a woman in the office, and it's time there was a person of color looking out for the interests of other people of color.  I Understand a specific type of racism that is personal to me in my life,  but I'll never understand what it feels like to be African American,  because I'm not.  We can talk about taking care of them all day long, but we would always and forever fall short of the mark!"
769,2020-05-02 03:48:18,g5gplt,"Mike Pence wasn't selected until July 15th. There's no reason to rush, and by then hopefully COVID will have calmed down by then, and it will get more media attention."
770,2020-04-21 20:46:46,g5gplt,"Michelle Obama has the grit and the charisma needed to unite what's left of ths undecided members of ths democratic party.  No, being a First Lady isn't a political accomplishment.  Being an EFFECTIVE,  INSPIRATIONAL First Lady is,  or have you noticed the entire lack of any kind of agenda on the part of Robo stepford- wife that's in the white house right now other than changing the damn interior decorations?"
771,2020-04-22 23:30:35,g5gplt,"I mean, yeah, but that’s not a high bar."
772,2020-04-23 13:47:09,g5gplt,"Wait, so you acknowledge it sucks now yet you want to do more of it?"
773,2020-04-23 12:24:52,g5gplt,"I couldn’t agree with you more. But, picking a candidate based off of gender/skin color only without any other redeeming qualities just cheapens it.

Do you really think she would be the best person? How about Stacy Abrams and her poor qualifications? I mean if you really want to end racism then you should just refer to them as candidates or Americans.

I don’t vote for skin color or gender and neither do most Americans. I voted for Obama the first time but after many failed policies just couldn’t bring myself to vote for him again.

But yes, everybody does deserve to have a chance."
774,2020-05-02 05:36:41,g5gplt,I was referring to Biden's heartbeat 😝
775,2020-05-01 03:18:59,g5gplt,"That's true, but there's no denying that she doesn't want that shit. I don't blame her, either. He needs to pick someone with real political experience who's already been vetted by the democratic process and hope to god that whoever it is has the ability to give him enough of a boost to overcome the sick, ineffable fervor of the ""conservative"" right."
776,2020-04-23 14:06:30,g5gplt,"No friend.  I acknowledge that it sucks in any way shape or form.  At the very least, Michelle Obama was very good at uniting people and introducing humanitarian agendas that lets face it-- after this 4 years we will very much so need if we're going to keep trying to fight against global warming. There's a difference in outright nepotism,  and using a relationship that would be beneficial in uniting a barely healed democratic party."
777,2020-04-23 13:55:38,g5gplt,"Ok, i do respect that premise. Maybe I'm guilty of just going off the assumption that people are always going to see color first?  Like i said, that just comes from the racism that had touched my life just from my being married to a latino.  I guess if more people had your perspective, we'd probably come closer to erasing the problem of racial division. I'm just not sure if there's enough open minded people for that to happen!"
778,2020-05-01 09:04:39,g5gplt,"I'm not going to lie.  Since posting that article,  rhw opinions of other redditors have actually changed my mind on this one.  Celebrity shine was what got us into to this clusterfuck in the first place.  I guess i just sort of forgot that fact!"
779,2020-04-23 14:35:52,g5gplt,"Agreed! 

I just want us all to just see each other for what we are! We don’t have to be a certain color or gender just to succeed! Just be genuinely good and have the American people’s best interest at heart!

Hope you and your family stay safe! Cheers!"

788,2020-04-21 15:11:05,g5gol4,"You may have posted in good intentions, but I saw this same post a few times earlier.  Michelle Obama, though popular among Democrats, is vilified among the right and controversial among independents.

There's a strong case that Michelle's nomination could be counterproductive in this critical group, and the recurrent posts regarding this topic postulates a disinformation campaign that creates a perception that she may be a more realistic candidate than she would otherwise be.  

The intention of this, of course, is to generate enthusiasm against her in the right wing base and to decrease enthusiasm in the independent demographic.

The proper VP candidate should be the opposite of this."

It's part of why people were so disheartened in 2016. They saw early frontrunners in Hillary and Jeb! and didn't want the next president to be chosen that way.

I voted for Hillary over Trump anyway because of course I did, but these dynasties leave a bad taste."

I was disgusted back in 2015 when it looked like it was going to be Jen v Hilary. Then Trump came in so I bit my tongue and voted for Hilary. Now I'm going to have to bite my tongue again and vote for Biden. I guess if shit sandwich is the only think on the menu it might as well be a double shit sandwich. Do we really think Biden will do anything different than what 8 years of Obama got us? This is more depressing than covid19.

867,2020-04-21 07:27:34,g59s37,What the is progressive about Michelle Obama?
868,2020-04-21 06:30:43,g59s37,"i like michelle a lot, but i'm not sure i want her a couple of heartbeats away from the presidency, as i don't see her able to be an effective president if joe dies."
869,2020-04-21 06:31:30,g59s37,That’s good Biden isn’t fueling the inevitable “his VP pick is a token X to pander to the X community and therefore X is not qualified.”
870,2020-04-21 07:37:04,g59s37,Warren is likely needed in the Senate
871,2020-04-21 07:35:59,g59s37,Pretty sure that was the point.

Btw, the orange dipshit has never held office before and he's developmentally delayed and y'all voted for him."
874,2020-04-21 06:47:39,g59s37,I agree...there are many qualified people out there. But as far as popularity and diversity...she checks a lot of boxes. This is just a what if discussion...i can't imagine she would ever be interested or that he would pick her.

You know who has held elected office? Every single one of the Republicans who voted to acquit Trump.

The fact that someone has held elected office, sadly, tells us nothing about how much or how little respect they have for the Constitution."

902,2020-04-21 06:26:38,g59s37,"I'd like to see her as governor first, or in Congress for a few years.

I think the best choice for VP is one of the Democratic governors. Unless there is a cure, we'll be on the tail end of the pandemic in January 2021. Having one of the governors who have handled the pandemic in their state to aid Biden would be a big plus for the country (unlike the ex-governor from Indiana currently in the White House)."

Sonja, Karen Huger, Ramona, LuAnn to name a few. All with loads to give us. 

I just don’t understand how that’s a flaw for these women. The same with the notion that being thirsty is bad. If we didn’t have thirsty housewives we wouldn’t have these shows. These are all really odd criticisms. 


I know I don’t want perfect, kind, polished, always behaving housewives. How dreadful. How boring. Give me tacky, rude, outspoken any day lol"

Besides that she has had the odd moment of humour. But I guess it’s partly subjective, partly people deciding “I don’t like her” so nothing she does will be good enough. 


There seems to be a lot of unreasonable dislike for her because she’s rude, tacky and speaks her mind, when that’s the same behaviours of some of the most beloved women across the franchise. 


It’s been 3 episodes and they’ve been the best BH content in ages. I just wish people would lay off the quick absolute judgements. It’s like everyone forgotten how much Teddi was loved her first season compared to now. 


These things take time, why so impatient to disregard or Stan these women. Just roll with the punches lmao"

972,2020-05-03 06:07:19,gcknge,I’m legit confused by the fan base at times. Everyone hates Teddi for being boring but hates Sutton for being the opposite. Everyone hates everything lol.
973,2020-05-03 06:30:15,gcknge,I was literally going to post a discussion about this. I’m genuinely always so confused by this sub... what are they watching for?
974,2020-05-03 06:34:30,gcknge,"To complain? Lol I don’t know


Some people definitely just want to shit on BH, others just hate because LVP isn’t there, or hate that Kyle is. Some are super resistant to change in general. Others judge the women based on if they’d want to be friends with them in real life vs letting them just entertain us (the biggest mistake in veiwing ever imo, these women aren’t all meant to be likeable). Others pre judge, or jump to judgement after a snippet of something.



There’s also the tolerant, the ones who enjoy the ride, embrace change, are open to different personalities, and recognise there are reasons for stirring, snobbery, fakery and discord. Which is entertainment! 


It’s not meant to the “The Real Housewives of Best Friends Who I’d Like in Real Life” but hats how some view it I think."

Nesbitt was Obama’s campaign treasurer.   Martin was a bundler.  They were close friends.  Blanchard and Nesbitt also just happen to be the kids “Godparents” and have accompanied the family on vacations! 

If you look at the pictures of the children and you compare them to the Obamas vs Blanchard and Nesbitt - its clear those children are not related to Barack or Mike - er Michelle.   If you doubt it - I challenge you to find one single solitary picture of a pregnant Michelle Obama."

If you blame Trump- spread the blame to the Dems as well that bashed him for his travel ban from China on Jan 31. There are numerous videos of idiots like Pelosi telling people to “come down to China town in SF as it’s safe”. DeBlasio telling New Yorkers to ride the subway” Many Dems posted things on social media about how Trump was over reacting. Trump has done an excellent job managing an unprecedented situation. Trump was going to be blamed any way he handled this pandemic by fools like you. I’ll take Trumps handling of this virus any day over the stupid “nuclear deal” OBummer administration cut with Iran which included returning 150 billion dollars to Iran which also included interest. What idiot would ever give money to Iran- our number one enemy. But- OBummer & his horrible administration get a free pass on that one.

I actually fully agree with that because the transgender person I dated was female to male.  You do know that half of transgender people are FTM, right?  But yeah, nobody was more surprised than I was when my lizard brain started seeing that relationship as gay.  That’s how I came to realize that I like men and I’m bisexual.

I do have facts to prove that a man dating a trans woman is straighter then it is gay.  The fact is, gay men don’t find trans women attractive at all and most everyone who flirts with them is straight.  I’m obviously not in favor of forcing anyone into a relationship, but I am in favor of changing the whole heterosexuality purity culture that exists in many places.

>Oh and you shouldn’t care. But if you don’t, why Are you even on this post?

Because I’m trying to bring an alternative opinion to one of the dumbest conspiracy theories of all time.  I don’t care if Machelle Obama is transgender, but I do care about the anti-transgender sentiment that is never far from transvestigation nonsense because I have seen first hand the hurt such sentiments have caused to the lovely transgender people in my life who I care deeply about."

1357,2020-04-30 21:12:18,gb0l2n,"So let me get this straight...

Someone decided to elect a man with a transgender wife specifically because it would give other nations blackmail material against the USA, but then the USA threatens to kill the families of world leaders if they spill the beans as a power move expecting that for some reason all world leaders would notice and nobody else would?  And apparently this accomplishes something that a simple threat would not do?

If the USA were threatening to kill the families of world leaders here, that would be the conspiracy.  Not Machelle being transgender.  Why would the people of the USA be any worse as clocking a trans woman than the president of France?  And why would the president of France have a reason to give a shit, let alone make it a public announcement?

A man dating a trans woman is not gay, but even if it were one of the popular 2020 nominees was Pete Buttigieg who is openly gay.  That’s not a problem in this day and age, if anything the Democratic Party would jump at the bragging rights of electing the first gay president.

This conspiracy theory is stupid, most conspiracy theories at least have heavy implications.  If 9/11 were an inside job, I’d want to fuckin’ know.  If the Moon landings were fake, that’s a pretty big deal.  Pizza Gate is real, you’re damn right I’d want to stop it.  If Machelle Obama is a trans woman, ... what’s the harm?"

Cut off all contact with her, or friends of hers completely. Get yourself a journal. Write down all of your interests, everything you’d pursue if you had unlimited time and resources. Then start taking steps towards achieving them. You’re in for a long game buddy. It’s a marathon not a sprint. Find a hobby. Start a community. Make a website. Reach out to some old friends at school. It will take time, but build people around yourself separate from her. Win silently. Show how strong you are without her. Show you don’t need her. 

Wishing you all the best!"

Despite everything that you’re going through and everything that you’re feeling, you will come out on top of this. I promise you the hurt and the anger and the hate and heartache won’t last forever. It’s gonna take some time and it’ll be tough but in the end you’ll be better because of it. It might not seem like it now but one day you’re gonna be able to think about everything and it won’t hurt as much. I remember the first time I was able to talk about my abuse without crying. God as cliche as it is, it will get better. Just give it time and if you need anyone I’m here for you."
1421,2020-06-25 19:38:06,hfs3l1,"You have to calm down. You’re letting your anger control you. I understand needing to vent. But it’s hard to offer advice or want to listen when someone is this mad.

Take a breather. You left her. This is typical abuser strategy. They become the good guy and the victim feels betrayed and alone. You need to cut all contact from her. I’d suggest not talking to anyone in that D&D group. Block her on all your social media. Seeing anything from her is going to trigger you.

I’d suggest finding a physical hobby for a bit. It’s going to help you burn through your emotions. Working out, running, hell just go for a walk. Throw on a mask and go for a walk. Trust me some how after a hard run. I just feel relieved after a stressful time."
1422,2020-06-25 19:36:29,hfs3l1,"Thank you for your kind words. Do you know of any chat rooms or discords? I was hoping the folks here could point me in the right direction, as I've already tried like 25 different resources and am running out of ideas."
1423,2020-06-25 19:40:37,hfs3l1,"I appreciate the guidance, but I think you may be projecting a bit. My ex is certaintly not a narcissist. A selfish alcoholic maybe, but certainly not a narcissist. I'm already mega fucking depressed and super lonely, and my friends aren't really making time for me, so I don't have much energy for anything. I'm running on fumes here."

1425,2020-06-25 19:42:21,hfs3l1,Please don't tell me to calm down. When has that ever helped anyone? I'm just trying to find people who can be supportive right now. I'm already doing all the things yall are suggesting and they aren't working.

1428,2020-06-25 19:47:56,hfs3l1,Well now you have the support of fellow Redditors who have felt the way you’ve felt and are here to help you. Having a good support system can make a world of a difference. We’re all here for you
1429,2020-06-25 19:54:40,hfs3l1,"It tends to help alot. I have multiple family members who have severe trauma and panic attacks. You let them know they need to calm down and breath. Then start giving there mind something else to focus on. I find that people who don’t like to be told to calm down. Seem to actually enjoy being mad they want that rush of being angry. It doesn’t hurt as much as being sad and working through their feelings. 

No where in your post did you say you were doing any of those things. That’s why I suggested them. Those are all supportive things that will help you work through it."

There's multiple subreddits devoted to media contradicting itself depending on who they're talking about. On both sides.

I recall, I think it was from Washington Post, an opinion article talking about how Michelle Obama wearing a white dress showed she was a strong independent woman. The *same exact writer* then had an article about how Melania Trump wearing a white dress meant she was a white supremacist."

This video clearly demonstrates a pattern of hypocrisy.  

So I think this post is speaking more to that LEVEL of media bias and it's elevated to a point of cringe when they do this so blatantly, any reasonable person would cringe when they literally say 1-4 years later after MO ""it's so obvious. Leave the first lady alone"" more like, ""it's so obvious you are treating MT more positively than MO"" which begs the question -- why? Where was that advice to themselves when criticizing MO? This is evidence that they deserve 0 respect as a media organization.

Find similar trends on CNN or MSNBC where the role is reverse? That might help you try to defend Fox news because you're trying to group other media agencies with Fox news as if they're on the same level (oh yeah this is old news, all media does this)-- they're not and THIS video is another CLEAR example of that.

1538,2020-06-26 08:25:26,hfqo1v,Barbara Bush’s hair went prematurely white from stress when she became a mother. I cant remember if it was the car accident that killed her parents when she was near the very end of her first pregnancy so she couldnt travel to their funeral or when her 3 year old daughter died of leukemia in the late 50s when there was little the doctors could do for her. Or loosing her 5th and last pregnancy at home in a traumatic way. Or just the stress of having your husband head the frikkin CIA. Or years of crippling major depression.

Melania wears white:

* ""That outfit could be another reminder that in the G.O.P. white is always right"".

Hillary wears white:

* ""Clinton's white suit told America loud and clear that she joyfully accepted the opportunity to run for president of the United States of America.""

They absolutely are.

In fact, *your* *resource* backs that up. Fox is *less biased* than MSNBC according to your very over-simplified infographic. So it's funny you specifically cited them.

It's only slightly more biased than CNN according to your infographic.

If you don't think CNN and MSNBC are as biased as Fox News, just in the opposite direction... well... I'm not sure if there's anything I have to say to you. Your own bias is showing."

Shoot the messenger, and ignore the problem. Murica!

Typical blue colored dweeb is typical.

And honestly I doubt it was me, even. Maybe the reason you heard about this evil shit was because.. oh.. I dont know.. BECAUSE IT HAPPENED????

See, when you can actually meet the criteria for consciousness : AWAKE / RESPONDING TO STIMULUS , you can take information and ABSORB IT and maybe CHANGE or GROW given that new stimulus. And here we are in 2020, about to lose to Trump a second time after learning f$cking nothing because dumb@ss plebs like you would rather b$tch at me for pointing out evil shit our party does than be upset that our political party does evil shit.

Meanwhile, in 2016 our political party literally argued in court where they were accused of FRAUD that our blue votes in the primary dont mean f#cking anything:

""We could pick our candidate in a smoke filled room if we want""

Bernie had more loyal supporters than Hillary did. So if HILLARY won the popular vote and she was LESS popular. Really?? Do the math, kiddo. Literally the entire nation LOVED Bernie Sanders. Meanwhile, a lot of democrats HATED Hillary, myself included. I would never vote for someone so evil.

Not only that, you can see the proof of more people loving Bernie than Hillary in Bernies largest number of individual donations, ever. AKA from actual people.

Meanwhile Hillary is getting paid millions of dollars to tell banksters 'you should regulate yourselves' and 'its important to have a different public and private policy, lest people get upset with how you really feel'.

This, on top of colluding with the DNC which lead to the DNC fraud lawsuit where the DNC literally argued in court 'we can pick our candidate in a smoke filled room if we want'. Person who serves the DNC fraud lawsuit: Shawn Lucas, is assassinated with fentanyl, another opioid, and a muscle relaxer.

On top of colluding with MSM, having debate questions leaked to her, having MSM outlets attack Bernie, AND promote Trump ON PURPOSE as a 'pied piper' candidate. On top of nation wide election fraud in the primaries.

The top tax bracket doesnt even account for people making more than 1m$, let alone multi-millions, or even BILLIONS. But yea lets tax people who make a billion dollars in a year the same as someone who makes $622,050. OR ELSE IT MIGHT BE SOCIALISM IM NOT SURE. SCARY STUFF.

And woe is me, I only make 2,000,000$ per year after my ""50%"" taxes. How ever will I cope!? I might not be able to purchase any politicians this year with such low wages! AND I WAS GOING TO GET A NEW YACHT, and now THAT plan is f\*cked!"

Who asked that question?  Because, again, of course all media is biased. It wasn't ""What, can you believe the media does this?!"" Then you can go ahead with that  "" yes duh/of course, it's on both sides."" I don't think that's the point of this post and why you are getting downvoted. It's showing Fox's cringey coverage of the two recent FLOTUSes.

The point of mine was to show the RIDICULOUS level of Fox's coverage of the FLOTUSes. Does the chart indicate that kind of coverage? I mentioned those specifically, again, because they are left leaning and the roles could be reversed and give you more relevant evidence than whatever you linked before. Im not here defending CNN/MSNBC -- I stated them specifically because OVERALL they ARE biased. It's a resource to hunt for and find support where the roles are reversed (+MO, -MT, here it's -MO, +MT). Get it? 

Some more guiding questions for you:

So, you have those thoughts that all media does it -- what about this video is or is not cringey? why?

What you were appearing to do to many of us I presume based on the downvotes is implicitly glossing over this cringey hypocrisy because ""everyone does it"" -- here's proof -- oh wait it's not great proof actually -- but yeah everyone does it."

Do you mean QEII's son or Charles II, whose brother, the Duke of York (later King James II), created the Royal African Company that ""shipped more African slaves to the Americas than any other institution in the history of the Atlantic slave trade""?

This is apart from the millions of pounds of private income she and Charles each get from the Duchy of Lancaster and Cornwall.

She laid them off because she could.

1752,2020-06-25 15:44:48,hfm3nd,"I love how everyone acts like she is the one who made every decision that led to them leaving. I refuse to believe that Harry, a grown man who grew up royal, served in a war, saw the relentless pursuit (and ultimately the death ) of his mother at the hands of the paparazzi, is not capable of making decisions about his own family. He has already shown he is protective of them, so why is it so hard to think he and Meghan make these decisions together? He's not some helpless child, he's a grown, married man who made a decision to leave a toxic relationship."

1754,2020-06-26 13:35:18,hfm3nd,"I agree, I was a fan of M & H, and thrilled to finally have some diversity in the Royal Family. But the hypocrisy and optics have been dreadful, especially regarding the environment. Also, on the Africa documentary when Meghan complained about the press she'd received,  I felt uncomfortable as she had been meeting with rape and sexual violence victims. Couldn't she have waited and done an interview after the tour? It appeared as though her mind was on her own pain - which may be very real to her and I'm not dismissing it - but it's clearly overshadowed by the adversity faced by the individuals she was meeting. Shocking Optics.  Also Harry talking about his brother on the documentary is so awful, he was clearly trying to evoke sympathy knowing that William, because of his position, can never defend himself. Now when we think of that documentary we only think about how M and H were feeling, not the individuals and charities they were supposed to be shining a light on. I wish them luck in the future, but they will garner no respect from me until they stop making speeches and practice what the preach. Taking a private flight to see Elton John, or for a birthday 'jolly'  to Ibiza doesn't cut it for me. And H may say it's for 'security reasons', but if that is the case, then why do Kate and William fly commercially?"
1755,2020-07-25 23:56:01,hfm3nd,"Not sure if anyone’s mentioned Harry’s reputation for not being the sharpest knife in the drawer. The Royals went to great lengths to have him pass one A level (Art) only for allegations to surface that he had a great deal of help to do so.

He’s easily distracted and always looking to fit in. In the Army he found that, his high profile always got in the way of being one of the lads but it was the closest he was to being happy.

Yes Meghan is ambitious beyond her capabilities but this isn’t 100% on her. Harry is a little lost boy and in her he thought/thinks he found something lost long ago. Her mistake wasn’t getting off on the first floor like all of his exes and aiming to go full Diana. Never go full Diana."

On the other hand the Windsors are not close to their level.  Harry barely passed high school, he was accused of cheating to even pass art.  His accomplishment in life was being born to the right person.  Meghan has hustled. But her meager roles are nothing compared to the combined accomplishments of the Obama's.  It is delusional."
1759,2020-06-25 21:26:36,hfm3nd,"I've been watching this YouTuber According 2Tazz. I really highly recommend watching a few of her videos, because everything does seem really off. I loved Suits (pre Royal) and really thought she was a cool down to earth person. But over the course of 6 months, my opinion of her did change. 
One thing I can't stand are hypocrites, and it did start with them praising about caring the environment when their actions spoke otherwise. They are wonderful speakers, and I do find them engaging. But how can one take them seriously if they don't follow what they preach? The environment was the biggest one I was very disappointed with. Then what followed was them wanting privacy, which I whole heartedly understand, only for them to do exactly the opposite of trying to actually have privacy. Seems very strange to me.
If they want to become celebrities, get involved politically, do speaking engagements, get rich, all power to them. But atleast be honest about your actions. Actions always speak louder than words. And because their actions seems to depict the exact opposite of what they preach, unfortunately I can't respect them."

She also realized KP doesn't give a crap about her acting career and ""fame"" and she can't profit off her title. So she left and went back to LA where her Royal status would make her part of the upper echelon of the rich and famous, whereas before she was a D list celebrity."

She is beautiful. But then how she treated her father. And then not inviting any family to her wedding.  I was convinced she was just a pathological liar when she released that video publicly (her private speech to her old school) about how she saw ""trees burning"" during the Rodney king riots. Blatant BS, I lived in that area and how she described it wasnt how it was. No trees were burning,  like wtf?! Weird thing to lie about, almost like she couldn't help it.  I'm just bored of them now.
Michelle and Barack are harvard lawyers, who really did do things to help people. They deserve everything they got.  Harry and meghan have not done ANYTHING except give lame speeches lecturing people."

It’s very clear that this was a joint decision. Harry has always been strong-willed. If he didn’t want to leave, he wouldn’t have left.

The people who criticise Harry and Meghan began as their fans! We are just so disappointed that they showed themselves to be so selfish and disrespectful. We still have respect for and interest in the royal family which is why we are vocally opposing the stunts that Harry and Meghan pull. Does this help you understand why so many people speak out against them? They aren't just wealthy celebrities living their best life. They were public representatives of the Queen who spent millions on a ROYAL wedding, royal household, royal tours, and then abruptly quit ""royal life""
 in a disrespectful and sneaky way. Now they pull PR stunts constantly to keep the public talking about them instead of just keeping private. They have made themselves into a joke and keep inserting themselves into public gossip by releasing their statements through ""sources."""

This reason alone made me want her to prove everyone wrong. I felt terrible for her at the beginning and I felt like they were picking on her. But the way she handled the whole thing, Harry too... It was AWFUL. It made me mad, here she was .. a voice for black girls around the world and she acted like a conniving brat. She has a good friend in Katherine McGhee, because all of these important friends she thought she suddenly had split when she trademarked Sussex royal and announced on Insta,  their plans to break from the royal family and tradition... to form thier own ""royal family."" One where they could make all of decisions and keep all of the money. She did this with out asking the queen.. they made the rules and put it on insta.. It was a cruel manipulation purposefully done in a way to make the queen feel as if her hands were tied. They thought by announcing it, the public and famous friends would automatically stand up for it. They really believed if they were denied, that it would be bad press for the royal family. Turns out the famous friends were only friends with them because of their role in the royal family. No one, not one person came to their defense. Everyone has since distances themselves.  So many people had to put out statements saying that had zero part in any of it. It failed famously. It made meghan look bad."

Me meaning meghan.

Let's not forget her life style brand.. the big  plans she had for that. She literally tried to play her royal family moment in a way that was going to give her the life of a kardashian. It was trash. 

Notice all her new important and famous friends have distanced themselves from her. 

We're talking about a woman who turned feeding homeless sex workers into a photo op.. in which she carelessly wrote loving messages on the banana' s that went in the free sack lunch they received.

 If you can't see how that would be demeaning and embarrassing for a woman to receive a message in that way from of all people, a duchess... then you certainly don't have the goods to hold prestigious speaking events, Obama style

The environment issue isn't what bothered me.. famous people are like that. Notice celebrities stopped voicing their environmental concerns? That's because they can be attacked in the same way Meghan and Harry can. 

The hijacking of the royal family without speaking to the royal family First? That did them in. Think about it, what was their sole purpose for going for It? So they could reap the benefits without having to answer for any of it. What a disgrace.

One thing that did bother me about all the hate at the beginning was the tax payer talk, as if these people were getting billed directly. The hate really did seem unfair at first. I think the hate mattered more to her than the position, or the good she could bring to her causes. She tried so hard to seem so good hearted, but it really fell apart when she disgraced the rest of the royal family on social media. She made the mistake in regards to all of her new friends, not realizing  just how fleeting A listers are and why they made friends to begin with. 

 I feel like harry is being a good husband, he will defend what she wants."
1781,2020-06-26 13:20:53,hfm3nd,"Jessica Mulroney and Meghan Markle always got along as ""friends"" because they are so alike. It was obvious to everyone that they were both using each other. They both have huge egos, aspirations of global fame and increasing their wealth, and are social climbers who tout their friendships and name-drop famous names to make themselves sound more famous (even though no had heard of Jessica or Meghan a few years ago). Now that people recognize the name Jessica Mulroney, they are interested to know more about it, and as they pay a little attention to her and who she is, it was ONLY a matter of time before her true colors showed. She's self-serving, entitled, demanding, ruthless and stupid. That was Meghan's best friend. The more people see of Meghan, the more they learn that she is that way too."
1782,2020-06-29 12:28:21,hfm3nd,"The privacy thing was what got me. I would have been far more sympathetic if they’d said “We want to raise our son in a safe, private environment away from the limelight” and decided to move to the Cotswolds, or somewhere in Oregon, or heck, even stayed at the home in Windsor that they used millions of pounds to renovate (and probably now won’t even use). But no, they move to LA, where they will always be in the limelight and get media attention. And yes, I know Meghan’s mother lives there, but a. They seemingly had no issues living far away from her when they were first married and b. she lives a very quiet middle class life, while they’re living in a mansion in the Hollywood Hills or whoever it is. Totally different lives and lifestyles. The negative media attention probably played a part in them wanting to leave England but I think the real reason is that they wanted to build their brand as global celebrity ambassadors while also having all the benefits of being royalty, and the Queen said no so they packed their bags for LA where they can really go about networking with the powerful people who can help them get their brand going and live the celeb lifestyle."
1783,2020-07-01 18:00:24,hfm3nd,"I don't think that was the issue.  I didn't see any articles saying Meghan was wrong not to pose on the Lindo Wing steps (though correct me if I'm wrong)

Richard Palmer explained pretty clearly that the press were upset they had been lied to.  As they waited for news, the KP press office said Meghan hadn't given birth yet and the Rota were to wait for more news.  That was untrue; Meghan had given birth eight hours earlier.  Several news agencies made the incorrect announcement or had to change it mid-broadcast, which pissed them off.   

I think that made the press more critical of the cryptic public signage, the strange baby announcement by Harry at a horse stable, and the decision to wait a few months to say the godparents' names."
1784,2020-08-15 02:57:43,hfm3nd,"Sorry, but who wants to pose after giving birth? That’s a ridiculous tradition that should’ve been gone. I feel sorry for all of them that had to do that."
1785,2020-08-24 09:26:28,hfm3nd,"It seems like she thought they could be a new entity of royal family and do it their way in America. I understand the press stuff was hard, but if only she could have just stuck it out.. The bullshit would have eventually paid off and meghan would stand resilient and the status she sought would have come into fruition. 
Even her biggest defenders confirm she was a nightmare. She was a new member of a gazillion year institution and she demanded things be done her way immediatly..."
1786,2020-12-01 10:19:34,hfm3nd,"I disagree. I like Meghan. She is intelligent and beautiful, but the idea to exploit Sussex Royal for private financial gain is so wrong.

It's almost as if the grandson of the president of a country would sell the state's secrets or government business in foreign counties for personal gain (a queen has titles, presidents have financial instruments).

A queen or a king (just like government or parliament) is a part of the political system (is neutral, but names the governments etc) and represents the country. And the power of all of RF members derives from a queen (king). They are also paid by taxpayer's money.

Btw, I'm not from the UK. But I think that Meghan didn't understand, that it's not about Windsor family, it's about the UK. It's good for the promotion of the UK to have a RF.  But they could change Windsors any day."
1787,2020-06-30 08:53:55,hfm3nd,"For real? They are working royals.  I can't stand when people act like they are directly getting foot with the bill. You are not paying their bills. I know it makes you feel important and all, but you come off like a vapid miserable twat. Regardless of whether tax payers pay for their diplomacy.. its been going on for years. Why this on will and Kate, but none of the others before them? Also, being a mom isn't easy.. being a mom, a working royal and having to maintain perfection after having a baby after baby is brutal. Will didn't ask to be will. I would put money that kate doesn't enjoy things like normal folks can.. She looks like she might be struggling a bit. She appears thin, a little unhealthy. Other than that, Kate and will have done a really good job being bland and predictable."

She also has 3 young kids, manages to stay fit and active and look great, and she's a supportive wife to will, whom I assume often has a chaotic schedule. There's a lot to be said of a wife who supports her husband and family flawlessly, Kate manages to do so.

Not everything is decided upon because of race. Not everyone makes decisions with somewhat racist intentions. We call him Angus because he looks like an Angus. Don't turn the use of your husbands true name into an issue about race with your silly assumptions. Your assumptions are racist.  Its rude for you to assume that. We need major changes, but I've become frustrated with these silly arguments about *this being racist that being racist*  these complaints running rampant mostly proclaimed by white people who think they have it all figured out despite not living in the shoes of a black person. The finger pointing needs to stop, the message gets lost in that drama and people start to get annoyed.

Id have hated being in gossip magazines too.. BUT the RF literally told her to ignore it and it'd go away. (When I was younger I'd never think that would work, but now i realize w experience that its the best way to handle situations like this, not to respond. I'm shocked at her age she didn't heed that obvious advice, instead she got her 5 friends to do a gushy shes so awesome interview, etc.  Shes a train wreck.

It just blows me away that this woman so bluntly stated on Insta that they were breaking away from the royal family to form their own royal family  and do things their way.. unbelievable. They took the tabloid complaints about tax money and used that stupid argument to their own benefit by stating ""we want to pay our own way"" when in reality they wanted to cash in on the royal status without rules, which literally fucks over other working royals. The woman wanted things her way.. clearly. And I say ""woman"" because she runs the show and wears the pants... obviously.

The photos you are referencing of them delivering food are from a security camera, no paparazzi were there.
And no will and Kate don’t complain...I wouldn’t either if I were as lazy as the 2 of them are-why rock the boat when you’re allowed to do the absolute bare minimum with no criticism. 
Imagine having a platform like that and doing absolutely nothing with it. Their charities are actually closing down...but focus on the people who are able to generate massive amounts of money for their charities and both have an impressive work ethic."

They made decisions for Sussex royal that didn't include the rest of the royal family and they told the public without consideration of anyone else.. like the queen.  They went ahead and trademarked Sussex royal. They clearly wanted to cash in on Sussex royal and have thier own royal family away from everyone else and they wanted to keep and control the money they made themselves. Unbelievable.

I mean.. I understand them wanting what they wanted, but having the audacity to make that decision and put it out for the public to see seemed like a manipulation. .. they believed  the queens hands would be tied by announcing it. The royal family are usually extremely careful when it comes to announcing stuff on social media.. it wasn't a simple mistake"

Not everyone lectures us on saving the environment. You have to practice what you preach or it's going to be criticised. What has the fact that borders are closing have anything to do with saying they won't move to the USA because of Trump? Some of the pap shots were on a security camera but there were heaps of them walking down the street holding hands. Who are you talking about with the impressive work ethic, H and M? Where on earth is your evidence for them doing more than K and W? I was totally into Meghan when she appeared on the scene because she'd worked hard for her success and finally there was some diversity in the RF, and I have always liked Harry, so have been disappointed by their recent pontificating, especially with the Commonwealth as it was set up to atone for the Empire (which was abhorrent, there is not doubting that). Also, just wondering, which charities of Kate and Wills are closing down? And are you truly blaming them for this if it has happened, surely the Chief Exec and fundraisers are to blame for charities closing? Does that mean every celebrity/royal supporter of charities is to blame if they go under? Happy to change my mind if given discernible facts, so hit me with some!!!"

Bradby, the guy that did the documentary for Harry and Meghan, said that Harry was trying to get a meeting with the Queen to discuss it but was told to put it into writing. Harry refused because he knew there were palace leaks but they pressured him...and Dan suddenly found out.

As for the trademarks, it's common practice. The Cambridges did the same as well. It's more to do with preventing people from cashing in your name, less to do with making money."

They probably rushed to post it because The Sun will probably have some false twist on it. Even with their announcement of their charity, they rushed it because a tabloid found out and released false info along with it. Harry is currently in a case against the sun, and he's alleging that someone in KP was selling info to The Sun. Allegedly, the lunch he had with the Queen during their last round of duties was the only opportunity he had to be alone with her (idk how true it is). But yea, they never wanted to announce it that quickly and if you looked at the Queen's statement, it's confirmed that they were already talking about this (I.e. The Queen wasn't blindsided by their departure, she just didn't know it was going to be made public)."
1834,2020-08-07 23:17:35,hfm3nd,That's a standard practice to prevent people from merching off them. The RF does this (including Cambridges).

It almost makes me think that the gossip in the press is more than just gossip. Why be so upset over gossip? It would be upsetting if it was all true. It seems like there's someone in the royal family leaking all of this stuff. That explains their need to exit. Meghan would be super uncomfortable participating in the royal shenanigans knowing a possible family member was trying sabotage her. 

It sucks that the public berated them for flying in that private jet.  I would not be suprised if the situation silenced other celebrities who advocate for climate change.. worried they too would be called out for having a yacht or private flights.."
1836,2020-08-23 02:15:38,hfm3nd,"The Cambridge are ROYALTY. the Sussex are not. Thats why they couldn't sell their stuff that they'd already trademarked. BTW, the charity usually has the names trademarked. In Sussex case, it was them, not for a charity."
1837,2020-07-19 16:27:30,hfm3nd,"Our understanding of Royal protocol is just our plain old observations and assumptions tbh. The excuse of royal protocol falls flat when the Queen asked the press to back off from Sophie (when her tapes leaked), William who told the press to back off from Kate (when she just married in and wasn't doing much), and recently KP being quick to defend Kate from that Tatler article (which wasn't even that bad compared to the usual coverage the royals get). Never complain, never explain only applies to when the bad press for Royal A is making More Important Royal B look better. I suspect this is true here as Kate and William has been getting plenty of love. 

According to Harry's lawsuit, he's saying that there's somebody who's been leaking to the press. Meghan's lawsuit refuted some claims (like the amenities in Frogmore), and even released her text messages to her dad.

Ultimately, Harry's problem is that he thinks KP wasn't doing enough for Meghan. She and her friends were told to say ""no comment"" for everything, while the staff themselves were running to the press to spread mistruths. So I guess that gotta hurt for her, especially when she's post partum + privately dealing with her dad.

But yes, some of it was true. They found out about her baby shower in NY and apparently there was a security hazard there. Idk much about it though.

If you want to know my own speculations based on what a few reporters were gossiping about, I think William & Kate did a PR stunt with their economy/budget flight right after Harry was attacked for it. Camilla Tominey I believe (a royal reporter that has been very harsh to Meghan) mentioned it recently which was interesting. As this is just speculation, I don't care enough to hate anyone for it. I just think the family is general is dysfunctional, and anyone who steps down and earns their own money is fine in my books lmao"
1838,2020-08-25 02:58:21,hfm3nd,"The Sussexes started this process before they stepped down, and it was similar to the Cambridges. They halted it after they stepped down. Now they're doing the same for Archewell. A Google search shows all of this. Gosh."
1839,2020-07-19 18:39:38,hfm3nd,Damn.. Why are they so harsh to Meghan? For what? The reporters especially. What would they get out of It?
1840,2020-07-19 18:41:21,hfm3nd,"I specifically remember that economy flight too.. now that i thi k about it, it definitely felt like a PR stunt. Unless they are still flying economy.. are they?"
1841,2020-09-05 15:21:56,hfm3nd,"well, that is the problem, considering they had known they were stepping back at some point in the near future, and they still trademarked the name.  They didn't willingly halt anything, they were forced to. And I dunno what you read about archewell, but they didn't even fill out the paperwork for the charity correctly, or add a signature, and now have pretty much just given up on it. Its all a bit odd to say the least."
1842,2020-07-21 02:04:57,hfm3nd,"There was this journalist who has spoken about how a publication was 'twisting her arm' and even given her suggestions on what to say about her so she could write a negative article. 

This is just her experience, but i believe the smears on Meghan was done intentionally. The motive behind it however, are speculations. To distract us from Andrew? To send Meghan a message? 

Meghan wasn't a popular royal in the palace because she was known to work differently from the rest. She fought to make sure all the money made from her cookbook would go to Hubb (the kitchen the book is supporting) instead of the Royal Foundation.

She is also known to wake up early and start working, planning meetings etc to the point where it was really annoying for the staff.

Ideally they would want the royal to take a backseat and let the staff handle their work, but Meghan wanted to choose her own work and delegate, instead of the aides choosing and telling her how to handle her work. While that seems fantastic from our perspective, it seemed like this 'outsider' didn't know her place and wanted to change the way it's been done. This led to staff running to tabloids to complain, and she was then branded as Duchess Difficult. 

Rumours of members of the RF also came up, about how they thought Meghan was just in it for fame and would divorce Harry soon after. Don't know how true that is. 

Throw in Meghan's appeal to the public and you have people scrambling to put her in her place, while lifting up Kate in the process. As the more important royal has been getting the most positive coverage, there's really no incentive there to stop the hate against Meghan. The only reason would be to defend her out of love, and she simply wasn't likeable in that regard because she came on too strongly."
1843,2020-09-07 10:37:55,hfm3nd,"I don't think you get it...

they intended to work for the crown until the summit where they were told they had to step down entirely. So it makes sense for them to retain Sussex Royal for their foundation. Trademarking SR was a normal move that literally nobody gave a damn about until the summit, because it's a normal thing for the royals (as well as public figures in general).

As for Archewell, the back and forth is completely normal in this process and there's no real issue with whatever that happened. Of course, nobody talks about the Cambridges paperwork in the US (you probably didn't even hear about it, because the BM aren't getting paid to tear them down). All of this is basically a bunch of staff doing paperwork, no point talking about it because nobody truly believes any royal or public figure oversee this part. 

Also there is no indication that they given up on it. There's simply not much to announce publicly at the moment. Where are you getting your sources? It is no wonder why you think this is all odd when in reality, this issue is such a, well, non issue."
1844,2020-07-21 07:51:32,hfm3nd,"""Work differently from the rest"" is what bugs me. She was new to the family. I think it's rude to behave that way especially at the begining.  She should have played by the rules out of respect for Harry and his family. If she had an agenda, which it seems she did, she should have waited and moved slowly. I can see why she rubbed people the wrong way. She seems psychopathically type A, and I get that impression from what you've described about her above. Her behavior made her appear as if she had an agenda.. It probably made people uneasy and it takes a lot of balls to marry into the royal family and believe you have the right to do things your way.. disregarding protocol, tradition. She had an agenda.. and it wasn't based on her love for Harry."
1845,2020-09-08 09:27:40,hfm3nd," Their IG said archwelle has been postponed until after next year, and its not normal for the lawyer filing their paperwork to not add a signature. Tbh I'm way too busy and lazy to go do another research project to post links on all the weird evidence there is out there to suggest their charity was just a money grab, but if anyone is interested, check the us patents website online search. 
And every single I article that allows comments that features them has zero people saying ""I love them they're great"". Everyone hates them. I have no idea why they're even getting work or why anyone would work with them but I have no idea what really goes on behind the seasons of the rich elitists either."
1846,2020-07-21 12:45:41,hfm3nd,"Was Diana a psychopath as well? She has talked about how the institution didn't like her style of working and how it broke tradition, and how they tried to smear her reputation so she would lose public support. 

It's interesting how you think her style of working meant that she is somehow a psychopath and doesn't love Harry? It would be more honest if you'd admit you simply wanted to hate her from the start, because no neutral person would immediately land on that big of a character judgement. If anything, she's just annoyingly American in a stuffy institution.

It's not tradition to be a lazy royal, let's get this clear. If you looked at her output within her first 2 years, you would see that she put out a cookbook, a capsule wardrobe and a tote bag that directly helped her patronages (financially). Compare this to her contemporary counterpart Kate, and you'd see she didn't benefit her patronages through her own initiative. Meghan's 'different style' directly benefitted the British, as much as they want to smear her name. 

If that's breaking tradition, the royals need to do more of it now. No ribbon cutting, no throwing each other under the bus to prevent a scandal from leaking, none of that anymore please."
1847,2020-09-09 07:01:51,hfm3nd,"They don't have an Instagram account currently. Sussex Royal is their only account and it is not active. They also never meant to announce Archewell but it was leaked along with some inaccurate information so they had to put out a statement. I'm not surprised they're taking long, especially with COVID. 

The whole paperwork thing has got to be the most boring thing the trolls are fixating on. Many paperwork tend to go back and forth because of oversight. Why is this a big deal? That someone was careless? So what? Like I said before, the Cambridges have a similar experience and it's not news because...it's simply not news.

And no, not everybody hates them. This is the Internet we're talking about. There are literally troll farms for any polarising public figure out there. Also fans don't usually comment on articles if they're going to be overwhelmed with Karens. If you'd go on social media like on Twitter, you would see Meghan and Harry have enough support. You're just succumbing to confirmation bias. Remember, the average person who's fond of a public figure won't go out of their way by going to a website to comment an article. You'd just see their RTs/likes or comments on social media. 

Trolls, however, would stalk a public figure...find their address, pictures of floor plans, zoom into see what Meghan is holding and find the name of her dentist and so on. Of course they'd go to some website and spam hate comments. They literally did that to the charities Meghan promoted and have openly encouraged each other to do so, so Meghan and Harry would not look popular. The elites see through this, and the haters have poisoned the well so to speak. Their criticism now just looks like whining. They should have played it safe. Meghan never really had a very passionate fan base/support until people felt like people were being too hard on her. I, for example, never really cared much for her outside of Suits until I saw how Brits were treating her."
1848,2020-11-25 20:59:00,hfm3nd,I completely agree. You have given so so SO many examples and yet this person keeps turning it around as a negative. Definitely wanted to hate from the start in my eyes.
1849,2020-09-18 20:37:40,hfm3nd,"While I dont know of any ""troll farms"", (why?..created by whom, paid for by whom?) I do know there are bot farms that are paid for by whatever pr firm the paying employer hires in order to boost their popularity online. Im not really aware of any organic fan pages for Sussexes actually.. just a simple look on one the top 5 webpages on the internet (quora) shows what people actually think of them. Its not good. Their only fans appear there to be ones from India (known for outsourcing online activities such as this- i myself have outsourced to India, its very cheap and can thus afford more paid popularity boosters) who struggle with the English language and have the mental capacity of young teens. Most likely they're legit albeit young and naive fans, or paid employees. 

They still have the dormant Sussex Royal website and Instagram up, which is a loophole because while they aren’t actively using it, they are still using it to showcase their ‘work’ and to promote themselves. Even after the Queen told them not to. 

Add to this the Sussex Royal Foundation still hasn’t been wound up as a company, which means that it did trade, otherwise it could be wound up within a few weeks. That is unless there are some (creative) accounting issues to deal with. Harbottle & Lewis were the law firm that they are using for this particular venture, they've been replaced.  
According to The Sunday Telegraph, ‘Archewell LLC’ and ‘Archewell Inc’ have been set up in Delaware (a tax haven and where companies can shelter), but one must ask if it is all above board, then why hide the companies? To be honest, there probably isn’t much to see but it gives the illusion that there is a brand in place.

So how do you save face, while stringing the public along, while you seek backing, and make it look as if you had it planned all the time? Would one go to all the trouble to set up a brand as a hoax to distract the public from other activities? I recall my old law professor discussing legal tactics and what was permissible, and what would stray into the grey area. Hypothetically, when a client desires a specific outcome, how do you achieve this in order to keep the business, but also to act legally? Very often lawyers discuss mishaps and errors and the outcomes, and so when an error occurs and it turns out to be advantageous, one can’t help but do some chin scratching when things happen accidentally (on purpose) and work out to suit the client.

The lawyer used for the Archewell trademark application is experienced in IP law, and so to make one error is clumsy, but two seems to be ‘suspiciously wrong’, especially when the outcome is advantageous. Forgetting to sign the application is a foolproof way to ensure that the application would be stalled and is easily overlooked one could say, but as it’s the last thing to check on the form it’s hard to miss too. Of course it’s possible with such a busy caseload, but that’s a rookie mistake that few make. As for the miscalculation of international classes, the problem was that there is no definitive structure to the brand, and thus Class 42 didn’t appear to be included, although a vague description of what it entailed was included in another description. Part of the examiner’s role is to ensure the correct classes are being applied for, and they saw the application as having at least 9 International Classes whereas the lawyer only identified 8 of them. To be fair, given that the purpose of the trademark and brand is so vague, it is an error that was plausible, but for an experienced lawyer it shouldn’t have been overlooked.

The end result is that the application was on hold, and with the non-final action notice sent (2 June, 2020), a response (with required amendments) needs to be filed within 6 months of the notice being issued. What that means is the trademark ‘Archewell’ can be held without being active, thus protecting the status as it has been applied for (but not guaranteed). This works for the Sussexes as they don’t appear to have a plan, but it makes them look as if they have one. 

Most trademarks need to be actually trading before they apply, such as an active website and offering goods and services, because how can you protect a brand that doesn’t exist or trade?  Those that aren’t trading, are given a few months to be active, and that’s usually because of a physical launch of a product that has been delayed due to production or design. There is no reason why the brand can’t have a website outlining what their objectives are, and thus The Telegraph article making out that plans are stalled because the duo want to focus on BLM and the impact of coronavirus is simply bull."
1850,2020-09-18 21:14:55,hfm3nd,"so, all in all, its not just ""trolls and stalkers"" who are disfavorable of the sussexes, its regular, educated people- who don't like being fed lies by 2 people who have otherwise done absolutely nothing to the betterment of the world to have even earned their power position, and who are blatantly trying to pull the shield over Joe publics eyes in order to personally financially gain. Its abhorrent.  
Their PR firm sunshine Sachs is abhorrent. Companies like them that interfere in actual, organic online content with their shills and bots... its pure greed. 
 
People may have looked the other way in the UK when their prince Harry (whom we adored here in america too! And wept over his mother, it was very sad) acted as a rebellious teen who understandably made some major faux Paux, but we dont have royalty in america, let alone Santa Barbara, and we dont want them here. Hopefully everyone remembers from our high school history classes that we fought(and won) a major war over royalty being here. He will not and should not be extended the same consideration here. 

Dont even get me started on their charities, which are now being scrutinized as they're not exactly on the up and up. Im sorry but when you are pocketing 95% of the $ donated thats not a charity. Its stealing from poor people and manipulation. 
THE ELITES?? What and who are the elites?? They signed the same contract Netflix gave the Obamas. To produce movies and docs for them.  Obamas signed that contract in 2017 and have yet to produce a single noteworthy one. It appears netflix gave the sussexs the deal as a way of buying their exclusive rights. They can't give any interviews now to anyone except netflix, for a few years. They'll probably want a Diana doc too. So harry is selling out once again his dead mothers memory and gaining financially. He wasn't the only one who lost a mother, i might add. Harry also canceled invictus which im sure he used as a bargaining chip (some charity eh?) And remember when he couldn't go to an invictus thing cuz he had to go to the Disney premier of lion King? Which im also sure was another deal he struck in order to get his wife that voice over gig (which she didn't, as popularly claimed,  donate to charity- check the charities donation logs.)"
1851,2020-09-19 12:54:12,hfm3nd,"Troll farms are usually made to just stir the pot and polarise figures. It doesn't have to be a huge conspiracy (I.e. It doesn't have to be created by William.).

You're rambling on and on and it makes no sense at all. No organic supporters, really? I'm on twitter and I see real people (mostly black Americans) supporting her. One of them literally has police protection because some Meghan trolls found her address (she has a Sussex Squad podcast).

And the Sussex Instagram is not still posting. It's an inactive account and they stopped using it the moment they officially stepped down. There's no proof that the Queen asked them to delete it, and since all the posts are from a time when they represented the monarchy, there is 0 problem."
1852,2020-09-19 13:08:00,hfm3nd,"It's clear as day that the Sussexes have supporters that are not bots. Of course, confirmation bias is a hell of a drug for you. Time to be a bit intelligent here, dude.

Their charities aren't failing, by the way. COVID has hit charities hard but they're still functioning and they not pocketing their money, geez..these are all verifiable facts you could have googled before writing. If you truly cared about the patronages, why no post about Kate's having to close down? Or how they told her straight to her face that she didn't visit them for 8 years (no shade to her though, I'm rather indifferent towards her). 


Elites as in the people they're working with. They are the ones giving Harry and Meghan money and clearly they don't buy the shit trolls online and people such as yourself are spewing. The well has been poisoned and they know it. Every single move is heavily critiqued as if the Royals haven't done something similar (e.g. William pitching a documentary, Harry working with Apple or Netflix before he stepped down). 

Your past paragraph gave you away. Firstly, there's a couple of projects that are already in the works. I think it's Harry's projects. You can't act objective when you're literally whining about the possibility of a son making a documentary about Diana. Guess what, both sons can talk about her as much as they want to, and they had, and they will! Remember the documentary both of them participated in? They also certainly can give interviews to the media if they choose to. Please go and read up what contract they have signed. 

Harry didn't cancel Invcitus because of Netflix. In fact, he currently filed a legal complaint against that tabloid writer who wrote that piece, and Invictus has issued a statement refuting those claims. 


Again, confirmation bias is a hell of a drug. I don't have to be their fan to see the blatant attempts. The energy spent on smearing the two royals that is financially independent and not the corrupt ones who are covering up Andrew is one obvious sign. 

Like...just calm down already. Be a little objective. It doesn't hurt. A quick glance at your history shows you think she faked her pregnancy and bunch of lies. I say this with love, fix your soul. You know you have a problem when most of your comments are snark directed at someone you truly don't know."
1853,2020-09-22 07:56:50,hfm3nd,"Yeah I was a bit lengthy there... but the point being... it wasn't ""Not newsworthy"".  Smut mags and teenagers just don't care about this kinda stuff.

Im honestly curious what people admire in either her or prince harry. So what does this sussex squad do/ talk about?"
1854,2020-09-22 08:05:07,hfm3nd,"Well...Kate has a large family including 3 young kids and a home to keep up. Im sure charities are the last thing of importance to her. 

It's just in bad taste for only one son, to bank roll on his mothers memory. Sure he can, but should he. Then again Hollywood elites aren't known for their integrity. 

Oh, what do you know, another lawsuit. He could've postponed invctius but he canceled it instead.  Thank you for your prayers on my ""soul"", lol. It means a lot to me. And Hey, these are just my opinions, I'm entitled to them.  There's way too much weird stuff going on w them.  Just pointing that out. 
And as far as confirmation bias, literally I posted facts, (which you haven't done this entire convo) so...."
1855,2020-09-22 08:08:18,hfm3nd,"Also, im not gonna even talk about the creepiness that you stalked my profile and comments,, but i don't use my real identity online, anywhere.. I have many throw away accounts, this being one of them. So really, you have no idea what I spend my time on, its just that this one is to satisfy my ""gossip"" account."
1856,2020-09-23 05:57:21,hfm3nd,"Like any high profile figure, they'll have fans and haters. They have planted trees and started fundraisers before they stepped down and hired the PR firm. This is probably one of the most straightforward things one can see for themselves, but people would rather make up conspiracies about how all their fans are bots. Geez. Her fans are on Instagram and Twitter, and they tend to get viral tweets from time to time. It's a matter of audience. Quora isn't a good representation of the population because most people there are of a certain age group, and a fan in her 20s isn't going to go and answer random questions on Quora. Even the comments on Quora aren't factually accurate. Fans will spend their time on their own account, interacting with other fans. This is basically common sense, anyone on Social Media would know this. 

And to address your other comments.. 

""Well...Kate has a large family including 3 young kids and a home to keep up. Im sure charities are the last thing of importance to her."" if she's living a life of obscene wealth off on public money, then she needs to do her job. I empathise with working mothers, but hey, either she does enough to justify her privilege, or she makes her own money. I didnt care for H&m and this was basically the main reason why I have respect for them. I'd rather them be Hollywood elites than to use taxpayer money. Because either way, they're going to work with charities. Private money over public any day. H&m won't be representing UK in the US, they'll just be two people making money in whatever way they want. So your past comments about the ""war"" were pretty irrelevant. You would have a valid point if they were working royals that are staying there. I believe they wanted them to stay in South Africa, but Harry hinted at the history of colonialism. 

""It's just in bad taste for only one son, to bank roll on his mothers memory. Sure he can, but should he."" Both sons have talked about Diana at length. You're getting angry at a hypothetical scenario of Harry profiting off Diana. Chill a bit! 

""Oh, what do you know, another lawsuit. He could've postponed invctius but he canceled it instead. Thank you for your prayers on my ""soul"", lol. It means a lot to me. And Hey, these are just my opinions, I'm entitled to them. There's way too much weird stuff going on w them. Just pointing that out. And as far as confirmation bias, literally I posted facts, (which you haven't done this entire convo) so...."" The legal complaint is because Roya wasn't reporting it truthfully, hence why Invictus corrected the article. Invictus will resume later. I don't think it's a lawsuit but a legal complaint as of now. 

Yes, you're falling prey to confirmation bias and I've pointed it out (which you chose to ignore). This conversation is getting pretty tiresome because you want to hate them. You don't hate them because of certain things you happen to chance upon, that's the difference. It doesn't matter how many throwaway accounts you have or what you do with the rest of your time.

You've spend a good portion of your time being gossipy over 2 strangers. It doesn't matter if your real identity is here or not. Because these comments are still reflective of who you are as an individual. So honestly...be better mate. 

I personally can't comprehend wasting time on public figures I hate, so I genuinely don't get why this sub is filled with nastiness. I'd say leave the snark to politicians whose lives actually affect us, or pedophiles who aren't cooperating with the law, not to any public figures whose actions have no effect on us at all! They can buy 10 mansions for all I care!"
1857,2020-09-23 06:16:43,hfm3nd,"It's not creepy if I'm looking at this account only, lol. I would never try to doxx you or find out other personal information because that's just shitty. Your comment history here are made public, so it doesn't really matter. And see my other comment for your whole ""gossip account"" excuse (which is basically, it doesn't matter what type of account you have or what else you do. Your comments are a reflection of your true character whether it's on a throwaway account or not)."
1858,2020-09-23 07:18:55,hfm3nd,BTW I didnt care about them until I found out they were still using their titles while working in the US (which is technically illegal as we dont acknowledge British titles here) and she keeps commenting POLITICALLY AND SAYING SHE WANTS TO RUN FOR POLITICAL OFFICE.
1859,2020-09-23 06:49:09,hfm3nd,"Like I said, quora is a very popular website. Not as popular as Twitter maybe, but its def a place for people who are educated and able to come to a conclusion and discussions of more than 20 words per post. 

I never said all her fans are bots. I said a lot. The reviews on Amazon for her book had to be frozen because bots were manipulating the reviews to make it seem more popular. I read parts of the book. Its TERRIBLE, it deserves the one star people give it. Its reads like it was written by teen, for teens. Most likely written by markle herself, because of the included details only she could've possibly known, like what she was thinking or wearing or eating or her ""perfect warrior poses"" (yoga). 
I personally can't comprehend spending time defending a celeb you've never and WILL NEVER meet. Especially one who vagrantly lies to the public, runs away from responsibilities,  hates her own family, destroys their spouses familial relationships, and financially benefits from charities. Its disgusting."
1860,2020-09-23 06:50:42,hfm3nd,"I can see your obviously too ignorant to even have a debated discussion, and instead resort to telling me to ""chill"" instead of acknowledging valid points I've made.  Dismissing rather than verifying. So I'll end this at this point,  Good luck with your obsession."
1861,2020-09-23 06:38:04,hfm3nd," Also, you talk a lot about ""confirmation bias"", but totally disregard any comment that is verifiable, well thought out and correct if it is negative towards the markles. I checked out Twitter and the cult sussex squad, and it appears to just be a group of weirdos whose sole purpose is to attack anyone who make any negative comments about the sussexes, regardless of fact. They dont actually talk about the awesome things they're doing, (prob cuz they're not doing anything awesome) they just attack anyone who doesn't love them. Its an obsession. Something tells me you are most likely a member of the sussex squad.  
The person you mentioned who needs police protection against anti marklers, you neglected to mention they need that protection because they instigated and condoned people into actually hurting other people. People are rightfully pretty pissed. 
You seem to know wayyy too much to be just your average run-of-the-mill fan.  Curious how you find out about these little not very reported on details about them?  
And doxx away, you won't find much. Not to mention its ILLEGAL. But I'm actually curious what you'd find out."
1862,2020-09-23 10:27:01,hfm3nd,"You do know that since there's a one year review in place, them dropping their titles fully would be considered disrespectful to the Queen? They informally dropped the significant part of their titles (HRHs) that matter, but the Duke/Duchess thing is basically a gift from the Queen to them upon marriage (which means Meghan would be Duchess even if she divorces, like Fergie). The only way they officially lose those titles would be to have the Parliament strip it away, which will open up a can of worms. Think about it as part of their legal names. On formal documents, their titles are often used. 

And it's not illegal to use British titles in the US. Please don't be silly. You guys may not care for them, but the States still acknowledge them as Duke/Duchess ""technically"". 

Also Meghan did not say she is running for office or that she wants to. Show me proof that Meghan keep saying she wants to run. 

It seems like facts are no longer in style these days. Talking about political participation isn't forbidden, given that Meghan gave a speech on women's political participation as part of her Royal duties in New Zealand before, as well as the Queen encouraging people to vote in Scotland. The only issue you can bring up is that she's close with Left wing people, or that she's 'hinting' that she supports Biden. Which seems to be okay because she was allowed to do so when she was a working royal"
1863,2020-09-28 15:08:05,hfm3nd,"The US does NOT acknowledge them as Duke and duchess, I can tell you that without a doubt. Not that we ""don't care for them"", its in our CONSTITUTION. Its called the Emoliment Clause. 

""The United States has always held to the belief that an elevated rank should be earned—not conferred, bestowed, or inherited. Accomplishment, being the end result of hard work, takes on meaning because it reflects the true amount of skill and effort genuinely applied. A royal title that’s granted or bestowed upon another undermines this notion. A Title of Nobility makes it seem as if others are inherently superior, and thus entitled to special favors which others may not share. Further, the United States does not acknowledge any form of a class or caste system. We do not judge another by the identity of their parents or by the purity of their bloodline. Our Presidents are elected—not appointed by reason of birth or divine right. By preventing Titles of Nobility our founders laid the groundwork for a society that’s not divided by class. They stripped government of the authority not only to confer royal titles but to confer any power associated with such titles""

I can call myself a princess all I like, and the govt won't force me to stop but they won't acknowledge it either. Same for them. Its quite appalling meghan gets these ""promo videos"" and work and still lists herself in the credits as DUCHESS OF SUSSEX considering she's an american living in america. Its a joke. 

The proof of her political aspirations Are the newspapers and articles saying so. For legal reasons she is never ""quoted"", she instead has her PR team release info.

Meghan never gave a speech about politics as art of her royal duty.. ever.... since That wouldve been absurd. 
Its called meddling in foreign politics.  Or interfering. These are all facts. Just like all the other facts I've stated the duration of this convo that you just ignore. 

It must get old just defending someone for no reason, especially a nobody whose only accomplishments are being a gold digger (and a good one at that i admit)   

Remember when u said she didn't have bot farms too? More proof:     
https://www.macleans.ca/royalty/meghan-markles-twitter-bot-network-the-whole-thing-is-a-bit-insane/"
1864,2020-10-01 17:20:28,hfm3nd,"There's no proof that her PR team was the one that said she wants to run for office. It's just your guess. 

Also show me where I said Meghan has no bots. Since I only said that Meghan has large support in response to you saying that the support is all bots+there are bots hating on her. I already said there are bots created to polarise public figures. This includes dumb worship and dumb hate. 


Also regarding that title issue: That means that the US will not recognise titles in their country. I.e. No Princess of Kentucky, and titled individuals from foreign lands won't be entitled to extra privileges (assuming they're not diplomats/internationally protected people). Politicians etc can still call her by her title if they want to, it's just a title and not extra privilege. It does not mean that Meghan shouldn't use her title, since her title is by virtue of her marriage and would be an insult if she drops it without the Queen's permission. They're also still working with the commonwealth, so while I hope they cut off every single tie to that archaic institution (monarchy) and its people,  I understand them keeping their titles at least until after the review next year. If they still have their titles after, we all will know it's been discussed and permitted by the monarch. You're the one who said it's illegal, now you changed your tune? 

You said you were done with the conversation but you still replied..why? I won't be replying further, lol! Remember to vote ;)"
1865,2020-10-07 18:19:15,hfm3nd,"They ""leak"" all of this info. DUH. Its not guessing, who else would leak any of that? 

When I suggested they used botfarms u said here: ""Troll farms are usually made to just stir the pot and polarise figures. It doesn't have to be a huge conspiracy (I.e. It doesn't have to be created by William.).

You're rambling on and on and it makes no sense at all. No organic supporters, really? I'm on twitter and I see real people (mostly black Americans) supporting her. One of them literally has police protection because some Meghan trolls found her address (she has a Sussex Squad podcast).""

  Well IT data scientists have said otherwise, see the link proof. 

No there aren't just random botfarms floating around to polarize public figures. Theyre very targeted. And selective. Maybe actually read the article I posted. Its all in the there. 

Its a title of Nobility and its the only reason she's getting work here. Otherwise why didnt she get a 100 mil deal before harry? Why had no one heard of her? Why doesn't she just stop using the title instead of being billed as her royal name on literally everything single thing she does? That is extra privilege. Harry isn't even going by his royal title anymore. He's just called Harry now. Her title was bestowed upon marriage not birthright. If her husband isn't using his then she shouldn't use hers. 

THE commonwealth helps small countries who would otherwise be taken over by nefarious state actors and gives them a voice in govt and parliament.  So I hope they're also cut off from that since they're an insult to the queen, their country and the commonwealth. 

What did I say was illegal? Using a title. I said it isn't ACKNOWLEDGED HERE. and i haven't changed my tune. When did I ?"

That means if we have higher turn outs, we actually have the potential to have the greatest leverage in our elections!

One of the parties has been trying to effect that change.

States with Democratic control have been passing the [National Popular Vote Interstate Compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Popular_Vote_Interstate_Compact), which will cripple the Electoral College into irrelevance (since there's no chance we'll be able to actually get rid of it).

Michelle mentions that when you don’t vote, you give other people more power, in this case, older people, who do have higher turn outs.

1967,2020-06-23 19:29:22,hekajf,"I mean, this is a circular argument. Young people don’t turnout because politicians just ignore them. Politicians ignore them because they don’t turn out. They’re ignored so they stay home. If you want young people to vote, you gotta give them a reason. The party leaders on each side don’t want young people involved because that would change how politics works. Young people have become cynical towards politics because nothing ever fundamentally changes. I can’t imagine turnout will shift that much. Those who show up will vote blue/progressive. But most will stay home because they know they won’t be listened to either way."
1968,2020-06-23 19:41:04,hekajf,"I don’t think it’s that they’re cynical towards politics. Most just aren’t that interested in politics because you’re right that nothing fundamentally changes in a couple days, months, or even years. Young people are more interested in seeing their friends, not listening to politics. Meanwhile, older people vote because they know their votes count and politics does play a fundamental role over the long term. You don’t see fundamental changes in a short time. Unfortunately, young people have not been adults long enough to see real changes. That’s what Michelle was talking about when she said some people don’t see day to day changes. But we can’t wait for the politicians to give us a reason. We have to do the initiation. Professors and colleges don’t find you internships and jobs. You find them. You have to seek out opportunities. No one finds them for you."
1969,2020-06-23 19:57:50,hekajf,"Honestly, I couldn’t disagree more. Young people seem way more informed than older voters on virtually every issue. 

Millennials are in their late 30s. They’re not even young anymore. They’ve had 2 decades of voting to see neither party actually push to fundamentally change the system and improve lives. Clinton-Bush-Obama. The lives of regular Americans didn’t improve and arguably only got worse through each. Trump is more of the same. Biden almost certainly won’t be any different. 

The disagreement between myself and Michelle Obama is who’s job it is to take that first step. Telling young people to show up and vote(and vote Democrat) implies that the democrats are entitled to your vote. Why wouldn’t the same apply to republicans? Why is it the Democrats who deserve your vote and not republicans? Both are currently the party of old people/corporate interests/business. Neither represent young people well. So why are democrats the answer? Her argument seems to be that politicians will move towards you, if you vote for them. The same would apply to republicans then... So she doesn’t seem to be saying anything. 

To highlight the difference and disagreement I have with the Obama’s. I’d argue it’s the politicians job to take that first step. Like you said, it won’t happen in days/months/or even a few years. It’s going to take a drastic shift. We know it’s not on the voters because young voters showed up in record numbers to put Obama in office, then they were ignored. Even though the Democrats has a supermajority and didn’t need republicans at all. He could’ve listened to the young by people, but the party as a whole was the party of business and old people. He didn’t push the party. Instead, he just played by the current rules. 

I’ll tell you exactly what would happen, if young people suddenly showed up and voted in Biden and every Democrat on the ticket. Nothing. Same as always. Democrats could have a supermajority. We’re not getting money out of politics because those in power got there because of the corrupt system. We’re not ending the wars or regulating Wall Street because they all take money from them. We’re not guaranteeing healthcare as a right because they all take money from insurance and pharmaceutical companies. We’re not going to offer better rates for banks and loans because they’re all bought by the banks. 

Until the Democrats actually stand up to the billionaire class, youth turnout isn’t changing. Everything comes back to money. And the moneyed interests don’t want the youth turnout to sway things. So politicians won’t listen to them. The best we can do is vote Joe and kick the can down the road. Until a revolutionary candidate like FDR comes along again. We need a Democrat who is despised by billionaires. Not one who proudly does fundraisers to corrupt themselves."
1970,2020-06-23 20:27:39,hekajf,"I’m not sure why you’re trying to make this a partisan argument. None of my arguments were about vote democrat or vote republican. Michelle in this article certainly doesn’t mention vote blue. In fact, her initiative, When We All Vote, is nonpartisan. Obviously, yes she’s a democrat. But she mentions that voting transcends party. Also, young people as a whole are certainly not more informed than older voters. Where are you getting that from? I would actually suggest the opposite. Democracy is flawed, but humans are flawed as well. That’s why democracy is perfect. I agree that politicians could take the first step, but we can as well. The politicians could fix systemic racism, but they haven’t so the BLM movement has arisen and politicians are now starting to consider reforms. 

It seems like nothing happened in the last 20 years according to your argument. Why don’t the small things matter? DACA, created by Obama, was just upheld by the Supreme Court. I think this is specifically for young people albeit a small portion. Obama also pushed for free community college, but could not do so effectively because of a Republican Congress. Change doesn’t always have to be huge and fundamental. Society doesn’t just change 180 in 10 years. It takes decades and centuries. It moves slowly, but surely. The recent Supreme Court LGBTQ ruling said workers can’t be discriminated. I would say this impacts young people quite a bit. If you actually dig deeper into the small details, you’ll see that Obama did lots of things for young people as well. It’s just that they didn’t notice them in their day to day lives. But as I said, society changes slowly. It takes a long time. We don’t have healthcare as a right, but Obamacare was a step in the right direction. Things just don’t happen over night. I hope young people understand that better. 

I agree money is a huge key. But you know what’s even greater? Votes. You become a representative by votes at the end of the day, not money. Money helps you get there, but it doesn’t get you elected. Maybe there should be policy change regarding money with regards to politicians but you won’t get that as long as people don’t express their opinions by voting."
1971,2020-06-23 20:44:26,hekajf,"Both parties are representing corporate business interests of the billions class. DACA, LGBT rights, and other social issues, while important, aren’t enough. Business interests don’t care about social issues, that’s why you see Democrats supporting them. Good on them. Honestly that’s the only reason I do vote for them. But democrats and republicans won’t change or improve the economic situation. Why? Because they’re bought. Until we oust incumbents, that’s not going to change. Thats my view anyway. That’s why step one for me is destroy the corporate democrats. 

Why is it that we can’t get big fundamental change? We’ve done it before. Why can’t we now? Why is it that we have to slowly improve our healthcare system at the margins instead of just rebuilding and rethinking how we do it? The answer is simple. Propaganda works. Big money corrupting donors buy media, tv ads, and politicians from both parties and then they all scream “socialism” or other scary buzz words so they can protect the money interest that put them in power. 

We could absolutely shift to a system that guarantees healthcare to all just like Canada for example. And we could do it in a few short years. We just have politicians who refuse to actually do it because they’re bought and paid for. It’s really not that difficult. You show me someone who is/was against Medicare for all and I’ll show you someone who takes money from insurance and pharmaceutical companies. You show me someone who pushes for military spending increases and I’ll show you someone who takes money from the military industry. Same goes for any issue. Climate change, guns, taxes, bank deregulations, etc. you name the issue, you can easily connect it back to money. 

The conclusion is simple. Until we get a Democrat in office that fundamentally stands against the corrupting class, nothing will change. We need an FDR style president who’s seen as a traitor to the political and business class. Then we need them to actively speak out against their own party and pull them to reality. Until then, the only thing we can do is kick the can down the road and not see real change. Economics and quality of life for the average American isn’t going to be fundamentally different whether Biden or Trump is in office. The difference is Trump is a terrorist in social issues and Biden is not terrible with room for improvement."
1972,2020-06-23 21:08:44,hekajf,"I agree that corporate business interests are too high.

It's never enough. That's why humanity continues to better itself overall. That's why technology innovates every year. And you are right, money is central. 

Big fundamental change is rare and difficult because our own government is slow, sometimes too slow. It's full of bureaucratic hurdles. It's a disadvantage but also an advantage because that's what gives the country stability. You say it's not difficult but there's so many people that don't want medicare for all because they believe they'll have to pay more taxes. I think healthcare for all is great and I believe in it, but it will take time because of many factors.

Even if a Democrat president arises that fundamentally stands against billionaires, they'll find out that it's easier said than done. Congress is the branch that actually makes laws anyway. Humans are deliberate and take time, so small change is okay. Successively, small changes can mount to a large change given time.

Joe Biden is not a revolutionary man, but he doesn't need to be. He has more than 50 years of experience. He knows change is important, but stability is important as well.

Edit: I appreciate your insight. It helps me understand why Bernie Sanders was popular. He had many policies that called for fundamental changes. But those policies don't happen in a matter of 4 years because it's a lot more complicated than that. That's one out of many reasons why most presidents actually don't do everything they promise to do during campaigns. It's sort of like expectations vs. reality."
1973,2020-06-23 21:42:21,hekajf,"Humanity hasn’t bettered itself though. Not in America. Yeah, we have smart phones and neat gaming systems, but the middle class has seen a significant decline in purchasing power and quality of life for half a century. We’re not improving. Both parties are seeing to that. 

Our government has been altered and designed for it to not function for real people for half a century. That’s when we started significantly changing campaign finance laws. Both parties got bought and they became two factions of the business party. Nothing has changed economically for the middle class in 50 years. Not for the better anyway. How has this been able to transcend administrations, house, and senate control? Doesn’t matter who’s in power, the middle class loses. It’s by design. Do the same shit on economics and foreign policy and make everything about social issues. Republicans don’t want to actually ban abortion because then they’re done. They don’t have a carrot to dangle in front of their base. Democrats don’t want to end the war on blacks. Biden was one of the leaders of the fight for that war. Joining Clinton’s administration and republicans in some of the most racist “tough on crime” tactics that destroyed the black communities. If they don’t have social issues to focus on, they’ll be seen for what they are. Just a wing of the business party. 

Everything you said on healthcare brings me back to the point I made earlier. Propaganda works. Every credible study on MFA has shown people net save money, are guaranteed coverage, get better quality care, and have more freedom. Why is it always framed by “taxes” by the media and politicians? Because that’s the only way they can make it sound bad. Warren pointed this out on the debate stage. We never talk about true cost to the citizen because then the anti-MFA argument is dead. It’s by design. Media and politicians are corrupt propaganda pushers. Again, you show me someone who opposes Medicare for all, 95% of the time I’ll be able to show you someone who takes money from those specific corrupting donors. 

Joe Biden represents stability... We’ve had like 4 economic crashes in the past few decades. We get one every decade at least. Stability is shit for the middle class. What kind of “stability” is it when the middle class sees a decrease in quality of life every damn year. Now we’re seeing the results of it. Suicides, depression, and even life expectancy is getting worse. It’s by design. Corporate interests want more money at the expense of citizens. They buy politicians to pass the legislation that kills people. 

I agree changing the system will be hard. In fact, I’m almost at the point where I think we’re too far gone as a country. Our campaign finance system is likely too broken to repair. We’re never going to get a congress that agrees to pass meaningful change. I think this country is just destined to fail and decline, while having media and politicians focus on border walls, wars on minorities, abortion, and gay rights. 

As I’ve said. I know why I have to vote Biden. It’s something I’ll do without hesitation or regret. But I also know the quality of life for the middle class will continue to die. The rich will get richer. We’ll pass watered down regulations that are entirely optics based and won’t actually stop the greed and corruption. But we might get some basic police reform and other social issues. But even that won’t be nearly good enough. That’s just how the system is designed. It’s specifically designed by the donor class to not change anything."

As a big fan of Obama, having wived thwough the 8 yeaws and the tan suit, i am woefuwwy disheawtened by the content i see. Having been the fiwst Afwican Amewican, how can Amewica be wacist? But i digwess, the twue weason fow me today was to infowm you about the othew side of Obama that the pubwic seems to have nevew seen befowe. 

And no, I’m not tawking about his tan suit (whiwe that did aww make us waugh)

Whiwe we usuawwy considew Bawwack Obama as a powitician, his pwesidency did not faww faw fwom his chawactew. He, wike many othews came fwom a smaww town, [taught in a smaww schoow](https://www.histowy.com/topics/us-pwesidents/bawack-obama#section_2), and watew achieved his cowwege degwee fwom a pubwic univewsity. Showing just how any of us can twuwy come fwom the bottom up. 

Howevew it is not the schoow, ow the backgwound he gwew up in that shouwd shape the man he is, as a suppowtew fow Obama, I’ve seen his fan base gwow fwom just 30% to 67% duwing his fiwst campaign against John McCain. We wewe aww ovewwy enthusiastic at the sight of eithew a fiwst woman Vice Pwesident, but ouw eyes wewe much mowe focused on Obama as the fiwst Afwican Amewican pwesident. Having been a twuwy gwasswoots man, shouting “hope” fwom the wooftops, we saw the tuwnout of his fan base come back to win him an ewection against Mitt Womney. Having [90% of his pwevious votews](https://theintewcept.com/dwone-papews/the-assassination-compwex/) showing up, it is impowtant to note that the dweam fow a bettew Amewica was stiww vewy much awive. I fow one had wemembewed heawing the cweaw wandswide aftew Pauw Wyan thweatened to destwoy the cuwtuwe Obama had cweated.

His woving wife (god bwess hew heawt) has awso stepped up to the pwate to make Amewica a bettew pwace. Having been a kid in schoow duwing  hew powices, i have to admit that i have had bettew quawity wunches. Thewe is a famous quote “behind evewy gweat man, is an even gweatew woman”. Michewwe was easiwy Bawwacks best fwiend, and wight hand man. Whiwe Obama took the main howd as pwesident, Michewwe wouwd go out to wocaw communities, and make suwe voices awe heawd. One of the most notabwe acts the coupwe had done, was bwinging some fowm of Peace to the Middwe East. Suwe, we don’t have it entiwewy, but in Yemen, Obama had some success. And to cewebwate theiw success, and show the suppowt to the peopwe that things awe on theiw side, [the Obamas wenewed his wenewed theiw vows in a Yemen Wedding.](https://www.hww.owg/wepowt/2014/02/19/wedding-became-funewaw/us-dwone-attack-mawwiage-pwocession-yemen) They wewe awweady mawwied befowe, but a wot of peopwe wenew theiw vows. This was a vewy histowicaw act by the Obamas, to show that thewe is peace in Yemen, and thewe is hope (thewe’s that wowd again!) fow a bettew wife. One whewe peopwe can be mawwied to whom they want, without feaw of pwejudice & owd cuwtuwaw dogmas.

Now it is vewy sad to see Obama weave. Having been 3 1/2 yeaws, we’ve taken quite the downfaww. I think we aww agwee that Twumps administwation isn’t handwing such a pandemic wike COVID-19 weww. A wot of pwaces thwoughout ouw gweat nation has been missing suppwies, medicaw equipment, food, it has twuwy taken a tuwn fow the wowse. I’ve seen a wot of wawwies and chants fow Obama to come back, and just wike with twue democwacy, he did. Bawwack has stepped out of wetiwement, to give suppowt and aid to the hospitaws awound the countwy who awe in despewate need of hewp. I wemembew seeing him go to a hospitaw awound by me, way out in the Nevada desewt. I was suwpwised he had visited my state, since not many peopwe know us outside of just being “Was Vegas”. But the Obamas had donated a huge chunk to ouw wocaw hospitaw, [Kunduz hospitaw](https://en.m.wikipedia.owg/wiki/Kunduz_hospitaw_aiwstwike) which had given me hope, one mowe time. I pewsonawwy have not seen Bawwack Obama in pewson, but the day i Shake his hand, is the day i can finawwy west easy knowing i met a twue hewo. 

Thewe has been too much hate fow the man in wecent days, and i just had to say something.

1977,2020-06-23 18:25:28,hejzwn,"In the past day or so, the moderators of r/JusticeServed have made a AutoMod comment (I’ve sure you’ve seen it) on their comments. [Here is what it reads](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShitLiberalsSay/comments/heigmc/liberalismjpg/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf). As a big fan of Obama, having lived through the 8 years and the tan suit, i am woefully disheartened by the content i see. Having been the first African American, how can America be racist? But i digress, the true reason for me today was to inform you about the other side of Obama that the public seems to have never seen before. 

And no, I’m not talking about his tan suit (while that did all make us laugh)

While we usually consider Barrack Obama as a politician, his presidency did not fall far from his character. He, like many others came from a small town, [taught in a small school](https://www.history.com/topics/us-presidents/barack-obama#section_2), and later achieved his college degree from a public university. Showing just how any of us can truly come from the bottom up. 

However it is not the school, or the background he grew up in that should shape the man he is, as a supporter for Obama, I’ve seen his fan base grow from just 30% to 67% during his first campaign against John McCain. We were all overly enthusiastic at the sight of either a first woman Vice President, but our eyes were much more focused on Obama as the first African American president. Having been a truly grassroots man, shouting “hope” from the rooftops, we saw the turnout of his fan base come back to win him an election against Mitt Romney. Having [90% of his previous voters](https://theintercept.com/drone-papers/the-assassination-complex/) showing up, it is important to note that the dream for a better America was still very much alive. I for one had remembered hearing the clear landslide after Paul Ryan threatened to destroy the culture Obama had created.

His loving wife (god bless her heart) has also stepped up to the plate to make America a better place. Having been a kid in school during  her polices, i have to admit that i have had better quality lunches. There is a famous quote “behind every great man, is an even greater woman”. Michelle was easily Barracks best friend, and right hand man. While Obama took the main hold as president, Michelle would go out to local communities, and make sure voices are heard. One of the most notable acts the couple had done, was bringing some form of Peace to the Middle East. Sure, we don’t have it entirely, but in Yemen, Obama had some success. And to celebrate their success, and show the support to the people that things are on their side, [the Obamas renewed his renewed their vows in a Yemen Wedding.](https://www.hrw.org/report/2014/02/19/wedding-became-funeral/us-drone-attack-marriage-procession-yemen) They were already married before, but a lot of people renew their vows. This was a very historical act by the Obamas, to show that there is peace in Yemen, and there is hope (there’s that word again!) for a better life. One where people can be married to whom they want, without fear of prejudice & old cultural dogmas.

Now it is very sad to see Obama leave. Having been 3 1/2 years, we’ve taken quite the downfall. I think we all agree that Trumps administration isn’t handling such a pandemic like COVID-19 well. A lot of places throughout our great nation has been missing supplies, medical equipment, food, it has truly taken a turn for the worse. I’ve seen a lot of rallies and chants for Obama to come back, and just like with true democracy, he did. Barrack has stepped out of retirement, to give support and aid to the hospitals around the country who are in desperate need of help. I remember seeing him go to a hospital around by me, way out in the Nevada desert. I was surprised he had visited my state, since not many people know us outside of just being “Las Vegas”. But the Obamas had donated a huge chunk to our local hospital, [Kunduz hospital](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunduz_hospital_airstrike) which had given me hope, one more time. I personally have not seen Barrack Obama in person, but the day i Shake his hand, is the day i can finally rest easy knowing i met a true hero. 

There has been too much hate for the man in recent days, and i just had to say something. It truly breaks my heart knowing that there are such criminals running around not only the White House, but also on Reddit & Social Media who try to discredit such a democracy. [Obama is now in M. Flynn](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwitveThwpjqAhVumHIEHSFsAHcQFjABegQIAhAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lowellsun.com%2Fwhat-obamas-fbi-did-to-lt-gen-mike-flynn-was-criminal&usg=AOvVaw07CboG1fzbbOfuC4bCAdF7), somewhere in Michigan, spending his days trying to live his life of retirement and help his local communities. How we have gone from 8 years of love, to 4 years of hate is truly a sad sight to see. I only wish for America to come back to what it was, and we can all come together, once again.

I hope people can rally behind me on this, as we vote Biden in 2020. Thank you r/CoolAmericaFacts. I hope there is a future for a [Democratic America](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College) where we can all agree to give Obama just one more chance."

Prior to Trump, EVERY US president has had significant prior elected experience (or in a few cases, flag-level military experience). *Most* presidents were formerly state governors or vice president.

President of the US is NOT an entry-level job. You always hear people saying that they don't want a president who is a ""Washington insider"" or a ""politician,"" but in fact, that's EXACTLY the sort of person you want, and the utter monkeyfuck disaster caused by putting a completely unqualified reality TV character in the White House is ample evidence of that.

It allows Q followers to recycle old anti-semitic propaganda/myths without acknowledging they're anti-semitic; they don't hate all Jews after all, just the ones who formed the elite (coincidentally, this sentiment was the same during Hitler's rise to power.

Since then it’s gone downhill in my opinion to the point where respect means you must love or support him always. No I don’t. I’m a social conservative but my God he is a man. Plus what if he ever changed? If I got as nasty to him as many did ( saw the same with Bush 43 as well ) it’s be hard to look him in the eye if he “came around” to my side.

Who in the right mind wouldn’t? We have an actual bigoted nut job who in office. 

The problem with the right in America and even this sub at times is that it has gotten so contrarian and defensive that it can’t acknowledge that this is just insanity and frankly embarrassing. If the right is about personal responsibility then we should acknowledge that things have gone way overboard and we are at fault. 

If that’s what the right is then I’m not apart of the right and I guess neither are many Americans."

2046,2020-06-23 10:05:14,hdze9b,I wouldn’t say I necessarily miss him because I didn’t agree with all of his policies but man he was a class act and a pure gentleman. He would be able to unite the country especially in times like these much better than trump ever could. It saddens me that trump hasn’t tried harder to unite this country during these times but at the same time I also always respected trumps bold attitude and demeanor something I thought Obama somewhat lacked but I feel like trump needs to watch what he says way more than what he does. But I personally feel like we’ll never actually get the true great president we need unless they share ideologies from both the left and right. It’s always either the far right or far left for our presidential candidate and it’s the choice between the shiniest of two turds. One of them wins but not all of us as a country (besides the extremist on both sides) and that’s what’s the most sad. I just wish there was more understanding and compromising. I respect Obama for certain things he did for our country but I also feel the same for trump but both of them are far from perfect. I always felt trump was the better option than Hillary and I still feel like trump will be the better option than Biden but I’ve always usually avoided politics and voting because I’ve never felt a candidate has ever actually represented me.

As a modern-day nationalist, I can advocate for a wall and controlled immigration, and for some workable version of universal healthcare.

This election presents a stark difference and choice:

Democrat - Cave to The Mob. Reject the police. Open and vocal support for purely racist organizations. Open borders. A return to raping America with Globalist policies. The Green New Horse KaKa. A POTUS who has no idea where he is or what day it is.

Republican - Law and order. Controlled immigration. Jobs for all. America's concerns and needs first. A loud-mouthed POTUS who has some interesting, if not abrasive mannerisms.

2118,2020-06-23 12:04:03,hdze9b,"No clue why you’re being downvoted for speaking the truth.

I’m not American, and I think 90% of the reason most non-Americans lack respect for Trump is because of the above. 

He doesn’t seem to respect anyone, he seems to lack any capacity for tact or diplomacy, and he just doesn’t behave as people traditionally expect a leader to behave. He also harbours ill-will towards anyone who won’t blindly follow him, which is one of the core reasons I can’t respect him; it’s important to listen to, understand, and evaluate dissenting opinions. He’s a ruthlessly competitive (win-lose) negotiator, using methods that stoke animosity and ill-will.

IMHO a “Presidential” leader is diplomatic, and respectfully listens to all rational sides of an argument, even those against ones own ideology. They’re a cooperative (win-win) negotiator, weighing competing interests, seeking understanding, building relationships, and aiming to achieve amicable solutions whenever feasible.

Basically a good President/Leader should always act like a mediator rather than ideologue."

In 48 voting years, I have never had the pleasure of voting for the exactly perfect for me candidate but  there has always been enough distinction between  the candidates for me to prefer one over the other.  Meanwhile,  I research and campaign and vote at the local level to groom candidates more perfectly aligned to my own politics.  

You should give it a try."
2121,2020-06-22 23:17:05,hdze9b,"I highly encourage anyone who feels so inclined to vote for a third party. It may feel like a waster, but if everyone who truly felt inclined to vote 3rd party did so, it would probably be a significant block of votes that would either encourage more third party voting or wake the major parties up to how many people are out there.

Your vote for Johnson in 2012 wasn't any more of a waste than was a 2012 vote for Romney."
2122,2020-06-22 23:27:26,hdze9b,"I used to not vote as a form of protest.  Now I have re-evaluated my stance on democracy and feel that we should uphold the tradition of voting as we live in a country that allows it. Many people do not have this freedom and I feel it is unfair to take it for granted. So I will vote for a third party I can agree with.  Definitely not voting for trump or Biden. 

Also don’t let people discourage you from not voting either, it is your right to choose not to vote.    This is America. People get upset you don’t take their side.  But in reality we have the freedom to do as we please and by voting for someone you don’t support you are buying into a system that is already seemingly “rigged” in its own way. 

My own father was telling me yesterday that by not voting for Biden, I was voting for trump.  I was slack jawed at his comment. Definitely a propaganda talking point that I am surprised he had. But that is the fallacy of getting all of your news from Comedy Central I guess...



I would just say to really evaluate all of your options before deciding not to vote as it is a sacred ceremony that many have fought and died for.  Just my opinion though."

It was only going up.

Healthcare was through the roof.

Student debt and loans were through the roof.

Unemployment (especially in the black community) was at an all-time high. 47 million Americans were on SNAP benefits.

Obama had the largest deficits in history. He had the worst economic recovery. Obama was the only president to ever have a 3.0 GDP. 

He sat in office, spied on everyone, went on Nickelodeon or whatever, then took credit for killing Osama while he sat in his ass and watched. 
Anyone in office coulda done that.

Oh, let’s not forget his totally illegal war in Libya that fucked everything up there. 

Shall I go on? 

I can name one thing Trump did...unemployment fell at a 50 year-low. Already doing more than Obama did, without even trying.

There is no reason why, when there is a 60/40 split, all votes go to the majority. I just cannot understand how that makes any sense at all. How is that at all beneficial to the American people? Every vote should count. The system as it is means that Republicans in California basically don’t get to vote for president. Because of that, political candidates couldn’t give less of a shit about campaigning in CA. That just seems so flawed to me.

Not being from the US, I couldn't care less if the democratic or republican party are in power.

He is playing being President likes its a game show and that is hugely damaging and dangerous for people all around the World. 

The people who are against Trump but are not voting get a lot of blame from me because, as we know, these votes are crucial in getting rid of him. Even if this is the only time you vote in your life, this is the time. For the sake of humans everywhere! 

Biden seems useless, but I don't think he will do the damage Trump is gunna do if he gets a 2nd term.

Trump has one of the easiest opportunities for a Rally Around the Flag yet he *still* can’t unite the country, and in fact he divided it *further*

So yes, Bush only was popular because 9/11 happened. But the fact he was popular at all during it shows that, in comparison to who we have now, at least Bush could remain level-headed and not being his ego and further harm the country"

The unemployment rate you mention takes into account Obama's final months of office...



""Obama increased taxes on high-income taxpayers via: a) expiration of the Bush income tax cuts for the top 1–2% of income earners starting with 2013; and b) payroll tax increases on roughly the top 5% of earners as part of the ACA. This increased the average tax rate paid by the top 1% (incomes above $443,000 in 2015) from 28% in 2012 to 34% in 2013.""

""The bottom 99% also saw an average federal tax rate increase by one percentage point from 2012 to 2013, mainly due to the expiration of the Obama payroll tax cuts, which were in place in 2011 and 2012. However, for income groups in the bottom 99%, the average federal tax rate remained at or below the 2007 level.""

You know it is possible to scroll up and click ""Show parent comments"" and we can see what you typed earlier, right? 

This thread began when I disputed that Bush and Obama are the same. 

You chimed in demanding to know what major policy differences there were between Bush and Obama. You continued that by saying Obama is like Bush because Romney passed healthcare reform (lol) and then totally swapped in a new topic in the following comment by saying 

>""I didn't say that he didn't go far enough. I said he's not the leader you're looking for. He has no vision..."" etc. 

And now, numerous comments into the thread, you've landed on arguing that the country is on some trajectory (which you haven't identified and doesn't come from this thread), it's partially Obama's fault because he couldn't stop it (oK), and some other Dems mighta-could done it (also unidentified)."

Actually if you repeat that trick all the the way to the top you will find that my very first post in this thread is:

>We need something stronger than obama now. Something to heal, not just maintain.

My contention is that Obama isn't capable of change because he's fundamentally part of the system that generated the two term tennis match between Republicans and Democrats who would take turns favouring various corporations and smothering any change that might disrupt these companies' bottom line.

2393,2020-06-30 13:45:49,hik92n,The cult of personality around this guy is terrifying. He murdered women and children from the skies. He's a war criminal like every other US president of the last 70 years. It's scary how willfully Americans just gloss over that. Why? Cause the people he murdered have brown skin and they live across the ocean?
2394,2020-06-30 13:35:11,hik92n,"His husband does not, however."

They are all assholes who support the same evil things."
2403,2020-06-30 14:02:25,hik92n,You can look back at just about every president and find things you don’t like. I don’t recall saying he was perfect. But he represented America and the title of President of the USA with 10x more dignity and respect than we’re seeing now. So yea I do.

less?   


THATS AN AMERICAN LEADER RITE THERE."
2407,2020-06-30 14:12:22,hik92n,"I'm sorry but murdering innocent women and children from the sky is not ""finding things I don't like"". It is an act of terror. Why not ask yourself why ""you can look back at just about every president and find things you don’t like"" instead of just accepting it as a given? He can act as dignified as he likes when giving public speeches etc it doesn't change the fact he's a murderer. Nobody should get a free pass on that on account of being the american president. It's pretty horrifying that they do by most americans."

To satisfy your bloodlust I’ll just say that if I could go back to that murder than the one we have now I would in a heartbeat.

He represented America with more respect. You seem to hate the president no matter who it is but I’ll say that in the case of lesser of two evils I miss this couple very very much."

Seems like you’re quite the dumbass here David"

You’re an old ass boomer who definitely did not graduate from a college and you are ACTIVE in r/teenagers. 

Even trying to explain anything to you about the rigors of school is a lost cause. 

Also wtf are you doing in a teenager subreddit?"
2417,2020-06-30 14:42:39,hik92n,Come on mate I don't dislike America. I have nothing against the civilians of America what I hate is the American military industrial complex that is wreaking havoc all over the globe in order to line the pockets of a few families. I agree if I could swap trump for obama I would. I still think he's a war criminal and he shouldn't be idolised though.
2418,2020-06-30 13:52:01,hik92n,"Aw, is someone mad?  1.  Lawyers aren’t shit lmao.  2. Princeton is one of the easiest “prestigious” schools to get into.  3.  If she was so smart, why did she just get Cum Laude and not Summa Cum Laude?"
2419,2020-06-30 14:00:04,hik92n,1.  David is not my name.  2.  Obama is retarded so I would expect a retard to tutor a retard.

2424,2020-06-30 14:03:41,hik92n,"Dude. One look at your history tells me everything I need to know about you. 

Like I’m at a pretty low point in my life right now and after seeing your post history I realized that even at my worst I’m still not as much of a failure as you are. Thank you so much for cheering me up."
2425,2020-06-30 14:16:06,hik92n,"He’s either (hopefully) still a teenager who hasn’t gotten into college. 

Or he’s never went to college in the first place. Based on the fact that he’s active in r/teenagers it would seem like he’s more likely to drive around the local middle and high school rather than the nearby university. 

Why the fuck is this piece of shit active in a teenager subreddit"

If you think that people behave online the same way they do in real life, you are very naive.  If looking through my account to dig up dirt on me is what it takes to cheer you up, then so be it.  It’s pretty sad though, you tell me talking shit on others is wrong yet do the same.  It’s a painful irony my friend.  Have fun with whatever it is you’re doing I guess and never forget that you got so mad over a comment on Reddit that you went through someone’s account just to discredit them, not for what they were saying.

2437,2020-06-30 14:19:56,hik92n,"So your racist and “le edgy” cringe factor post history is you acting?

In real life you’re an upstanding citizen who volunteers at the local homeless shelter and stands up for minorities (especially ones who get berated by police officers)?

I hope you are a teenager who will one day grow up and realize how wrong his opinions are. Because the alternative is just so fucking disgusting."
2438,2020-06-30 14:48:09,hik92n,That’s what I said
2439,2020-06-30 14:22:50,hik92n,"No offense my friend, but Reddit isn’t a place I like to take advice.  If you can’t take a joke that’s on you, not me.  My “opinions” are shitty jokes that, surprise surprise, I find funny.  Idc how bad they are, morally or just not funny wise.  Also, minorities attack each other more than they are attacked by cops, but no one wants to talk about that."
2440,2020-06-30 14:33:32,hik92n,"Holy shit. You really are fucked up. Pay attention in your math class if you’re still in high school. But Stay away from high school if you’re no longer a teenager you sick fuck. 

Also all I said was minorities who were being berated by police officers and your mind immediately jumped to the thing that racist incels go to when they want to deflect from the fact that they’re racist."
2441,2020-06-30 14:35:06,hik92n,Whatever you say bro✌️
2442,2020-06-30 14:44:32,hik92n,"Look, fighting back and forth over something so trivial isn’t worth it to me.  If I offended you, I’m sorry.  If I made you mad over something, I’m sorry.  It’s not worth fighting on an app that’s meant to bring joy to people.  As I said, I’m sorry, let’s please go about our day."
2443,2020-06-30 14:56:32,hik92n,"I appreciate your civility.

But you’re either a pedophile attempting to groom teenagers or you’re a teenager with a shitty mindset."

2445,2020-06-30 15:04:39,hik92n,Well then change man. Nobody’s gonna want anything to do with you if you don’t.

So recently I came under fire by my friends. I have had my Twitter account for about three months now, I have a slight interest in politics and think politics are pretty cool and interesting. I am a 14-year-old Democrat who follows all sorts of people. My father Pete Buttigieg, Michelle Obama, Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar, Joe Biden, Barack Obama, and I decided to follow Donald Trump, I had heard a lot about his tweets and my curiosity caused me to decide to follow him. (Just a disclaimer I’m gonna need some Democrats to answer this question because of my political bias and the people who confronted me are Democrats and I want to know from a Democratic standpoint.) So I was going to sleep just now and my friend texted me talking about how our best friend follows Trump on Instagram. And then I told her that I follow Trump on Twitter and she told her friend who then both texted me about how it was wrong.I didn’t see how it was wrong because I didn’t think that if you followed someone on Twitter it meant you followed them politically. I was just curious about the topic and wanted to see the kind of things he tweeted about. I never liked one of his tweets, except for by accident. I was browsing Twitter when I saw the controversy about Woodrow Wilson and the university and whenever I’m on Twitter I instinctively like things, because the things on my feed are going to be things that I like, so I like trumps tweets and then unlike them but this time I forgot. But that’s not the point, the point is is that they continued to tell me about how it was wrong to follow him but I kept attempting to justify it with the fact that I was just curious I didn’t really support him, but they really didn’t buy it. I’m very confused on what to do. I wrote a very lengthy apology in which I unfollowed him which I still intend to do but I just want to know if I am the asshole.

For the record I did all this in text to speech so I apologize if there any issues.

As First Lady of the United States of America—the first African American to serve in that role—she helped create the most welcoming and inclusive White House in history, while also establishing herself as a powerful advocate for women and girls in the U.S. and around the world, dramatically changing the ways that families pursue healthier and more active lives, and standing with her husband as he led America through some of its most harrowing moments. Along the way, she showed us a few dance moves, crushed Carpool Karaoke, and raised two down-to-earth daughters under an unforgiving media glare.  In her memoir, a work of deep reflection and mesmerizing storytelling, Michelle Obama invites readers into her world, chronicling the experiences that have shaped her—from her childhood on the South Side of Chicago to her years as an executive balancing the demands of motherhood and work, to her time spent at the world’s most famous address. With unerring honesty and lively wit, she describes her triumphs and her disappointments, both public and private, telling her full story as she has lived it—in her own words and on her own terms. Warm, wise, and revelatory, Becoming is the deeply personal reckoning of a woman of soul and substance who has steadily defied expectations—and whose story inspires us to do the same."

2518,2020-06-29 05:12:32,hhsodu,"There’s no empirical evidence that a VP choice improves the electoral chances of a Presidential candidate in any noticeable way. So, instead of choosing a VP based on the disproven idea that he would increase turnout in some specific state or among some specific voter demographic, Biden should pick someone based on these conditions.

1. Someone who works well with him. A loyal and capable second in command, who agrees with his policy positions, and will not try to undermine his authority to peruse their personal agendas.

2. Someone who will not leave a Democratic senate seat vacant in purple or red state.

3. Someone who is qualified for the job. An individual with ample amount of executive or foreign policy experience, and could theoretically hand the role of the Presidency day one, considering Biden’s age.

4. Someone who is a worthy successor. The VP pick will be the heavy favorite for the Democratic Party nomination post-Biden presidency. They need to be standard-bearer of the Party’s future, and thus would have to be

     * Aligned ideologically with Biden and the Democratic Party establishment.

     * Is likeable and charismatic enough to win the Presidency by their own merits."
2519,2020-06-29 14:34:33,hhsodu,"It'll likely be a woman of color. My guess is Harris (though I'd like to see her as AG). She aligns well with Biden as a center-left voice which is key, because the path to beating trump is through minorities, moderates, and independents/disaffected 2016 Republican voters. Watching her grill Barr durning the Mueller report hearing was a thing of beauty which would be excellent on display against Pence. Most of the flak on Harris as somehow being a turnoff to minority voters comes mainly from white zennials (the same people who called them 'low information voters') who didn't even turn out to vote for their guy in the primary - loud online, but absent at the polls.

I would've liked to see Gov Whitmer of MI or Sen Baldwin of WI because they shore up support in those states Dems really ought to take back; but given that BLM has taken center stage again (also, per Biden's own remarks from the very beginning) I don't imagine it'll be anyone but a POC.

NM Gov Michelle Lujan Grisham is sort of a dark horse I see floated out there, and her background as Secretary or Health is also quite relevant in 2020.

Tammy Duckworth seems like an excellent choice. She's a successful, well-liked senator with a compelling military background and lineage. She gets under Trump's skin (who doesn't these days?) which would just be fun to watch during the election.  However, I don't see her mentioned as much as being on the short list, so my gut tells me it won't be her."
2520,2020-06-29 05:21:14,hhsodu,"The more I think about it, I come to the conclusion that his best option for VP is Kamala Harris, especially if the Black Lives Matter protests continue to be factor for the next few months. She has more political experience than other black candidates, and I think she is generally a good fit for Biden's center-left administration (a little further to his left, but certainly not as far as Warren or Ocasio-Cortez). I can imagine her making the case to race-conscious millennials that she will be a voice for black Americans in the Oval Office, in spite of their skepticism of Joe Biden's left-wing policy credentials.

A couple of other points in favor of Kamala:

- She'd leave a vacant Senate seat in California, which currently has a Democratic governor, so no worries about the Republicans picking up a Senate seat there.
- I thought I read somewhere that Biden said he wanted his VP to feel free to speak her mind, even when she disagrees with him. Kamala Harris definitely fits that."
2521,2020-06-29 15:11:43,hhsodu,"I am biased being from Illinois but I think Duckworth is the best choice. The number one rule in any VP selection is do no harm. She is a combat vet with strong family ties and biracial. She embodies the American spirit. She was the first Senator to give birth while serving. She has strong supporters but not overly aggressive. She is not so much a rising star to eclipse Biden (think Ryan with Romney). She has little to no baggage. (Harris and Demmings do with their former careers.) She is a follower but not afraid to speak out on her opinion. Duckworth can help reinforce that midwest mindset that can help (although it may be marginal) win Minnesota, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Illinois is blue (although an off year election may give the R's a chance at the next election like Kirk before her). She is young but not seen as too young. 

As for energy, she may not be known as a get out the vote, but she reminds me of Pete in that the more people know of and hear of her they like her and her supporters become really passionate."
2522,2020-06-29 04:29:37,hhsodu,"You can basically cross all the white women from that list. For better or for worse, the Democratic ticket will not be all-white in the current climate. So that narrows the list down a fair bit."
2523,2020-06-29 03:43:23,hhsodu,"Third time is the charm, or I give up.

Edit: 

Thank you for your comments! I'm enjoying reading them. Harris seems to be the favorite (well, not favorite really, but most likely). Some people have criticized her prosecutorial record. I'm not a big fan of Harris personally. Probably my least exciting choice (but so was Biden, so you know... you take what you can get I guess).

Some people like Warren a lot (I do too) but don't necessarily see her as being the choice because of her race. 

I like the idea of it being someone more obscure that the American people will have to learn about through the campaign and not someone who's already gone through a media craze about them.

I think Duckworth would be the perfect anti-Trump choice, as I've mentioned above. Either way, I'm excited to find out who it will be (supposed to be announced by August 1st)."
2524,2020-06-29 14:04:35,hhsodu,"As much as I’d like it to be Warren, she’s probably much better off in Treasury.

My money’s on Harris or Demmings, leaning towards Harris.
Given the recent climate on race, its most likely going to be a woman of color. Harris has the widespread support, name recognition, and ultimately, they aligned on quite a few policies early in their respective campaigns."
2525,2020-06-29 16:57:03,hhsodu,"I would love to see Susan Rice as VP!

Smart, Bad ass and would be a fantastic President."
2526,2020-06-29 22:07:21,hhsodu,"Susan Rice would be my number one choice from this list. The woman is brilliant. She graduated from Stanford before pursuing postgraduate studies at Oxford where she earned her doctorate (DPhil).  


She's been involved in White House affairs since the Clinton administration but has yet to be stained by any legitimate controversy.

She's also a staunch advocate for human rights and she is not afraid to criticize U.S. allies, and she would be well suited to tackling justice issues at home."
2527,2020-06-29 07:15:48,hhsodu,"I am guessing he will go Harris. Most of the ""she is a cop"" is coming from the same groups who attack Biden more than Trump. Biden has done well to ignore that group who couldn't even vote for whom they considered a once in a lifetime candidate.

Being black, it is puzzling to see so many white people (most under the age of 25) talk about how black people will be mad if Harris is the choice.

The good news is places like Twitter and Facebook have been laughably wrong this election season and the Biden campaign knows this so they won't waste any time taking their opinion into consideration."
2528,2020-06-29 05:42:17,hhsodu,"Kamala Harris seems to be the best option for Biden at the moment, although I'm personally rooting for Warren. She has one of the more progressive voting records in the Senate, but can still appeal to moderates to some degree. She's a Senator in an extremely safe blue state, so that wouldn't cause any issues. She's also a relatively young, charismatic black woman and is probably the most well-known and well-liked candidate among the Democratic base, bar maybe Warren (although Warren has shown less of an ability to appeal to working-class voters). Many of the other candidates being tossed around (Grisham, Lance Bottoms, Demmings, Duckworth) don't have strong name recognition on a national level, and Biden's campaign has definitely been going for the 'known commodity' appeal so far."
2529,2020-06-29 21:25:10,hhsodu,"It has to be a woman of color. It has to be someone that bridges the gap between moderate and far-left Democrats. 

One complaint about Biden is that he’s way way too centrist and choosing a liberal colored woman would really help his cause. It also wouldn’t be virtue signaling since Biden was Vice President for a Black President. 

Kamala Harris would be a safe pick."
2530,2020-06-30 00:42:38,hhsodu,"I think Biden knows and most voters know that there will need to be some significant changes to come and that there’s no going back to normal after Trump, especially if we enter a recession and still have an ongoing pandemic to deal with, alongside a lot of the policing reform that’s needed. Obama himself basically said Democrats are gonna have to do a lot more. A Biden administration faces quite a long “To-Do” list and in that sense, Warren makes sense because she was always the “I have a plan” candidate which will also reassures voters in the Fall who not only want Trump out, but want someone who has a plan to get us out of this economic pandemic shitstorm that Trump doesn’t care about at all. It provides a good contrast, especially considering Trump couldn’t even name his priorities for a second term. On top of all that, it will nudge more progressives to assure their turn out in November, though i imagine most were gonna turn out anyway. Warren is also probably the most well known of the VP candidates.

Harris also seems like the natural pick since she also has developed a national profile, black woman, younger so could be seen as a successor. Makes sense on paper. 

I’d lean Warren as the better pick but probably lean Harris as the more likely pick. I think it’s down to those two"
2531,2020-06-30 01:46:04,hhsodu,Someone sell me on why it *shouldn't* be Rice. She just seems like an awesome choice. I would be perfectly happy with her as the one to take command if something happened to Biden.
2532,2020-06-29 06:29:57,hhsodu,"

Personally, I would like for it to be Warren because good VP picks come from parts of the party that aren't a part of the candidate's coalition. Black voters and Suburban voters overwhelmingly supported Biden. He has got them and if he doesn't, then I am confused why they voted for him in the first place at the levels they did. The Progressive base is disillusioned by Biden and need the VP to be someone they can get behind. On paper that would be Warren. 

People are comcerned about her Senate seat but frankly, that isn't a concern unless you think Democrats will fumble the special election again like they did in 2009.  That could happen in California too, btw. Warren would be replaced by a Democrat the same way that Kerry would have been had he won in 2004. Democrats hold a Supermajority in the Massachusetts Legislature which means that they can pass a bill that forces the Governor of MA to pick a Democratic replacent until a Special election is held, I want to say 120 days later. That is exactly what Democrats in Massachusetts did in 2004 with Gov. Romney when Kerry ran for President. 

She is miles better than Harris and Val Demmings, even in this day in age because she doesn't have a record of being a part of the criminal justice system.  If responding to the protest is what the Biden campaign wants, he can do better than Warren, obviously. However, I think Warren is a better pick than the former AG of California and a former police officer because she has never been a part of the system BLM is protesting against. 

My only concern is if Warren is enough to excite disillusioned Bernie supporters. Is the fact that she ran in 2020 too damaging to her ""Progressive"" credentials? If so, then she is an awful pick with little upside and Biden should stay far away from her. While she is plainly ready to be President, the risk of alienating moderates and big party donors is too great if she doesn't bring in voters and volunteers to replace them with. 

I say this as a die-hard Warren supporter in 2020. I know I will give more if she is picked but I am not a voter Biden needs to be chasing. Warren's 10-15% is pretty solid and we will come out harder if she is picked, but her real upside is if she can reach Bernie's diehard 10-20%. 

In that case, I think Susan Rice has the best shot, of those Biden seems to seriously be considering. Rice works well with the message the Biden campaign is sending of a return to a normal and competent government. She has the executive experience and if Bernie Progressives cannot be reached unless he picks someone deep in the Bernie camp, if that, then there is no one else in the party he can chase (other than maybe Latinos, but he does not seem to be considering any Latina women right now). He might as well focus on getting his government ready while Trump continues to shoot himself over and over again."
2533,2020-06-29 11:47:40,hhsodu,"Susan Rice for VP, we need her international experience because we have to kiss our allies ass for a long time to win back their trust and cooperation. We have a lot of work to do to repair the damage that Trump has done."
2534,2020-06-29 06:15:41,hhsodu,"I Really like Elizabeth Warren. I like a lot of the things shes said over the past few years, but what really makes me like her is how much my old Uncle HATES her, which means FOX News HATES her and he heard it on FOX News, which means Ruoert Murdoch hates her...and that's all I need to know to know that shes my favorite choice.

If shes worth Murdochs ire that means shes done good work for the world and hes afraid she will do more."
2535,2020-06-30 16:16:08,hhsodu,"Biden should choose Susan Rice and do it soon. Rice is the ideal candidate to prosecute the case of ignoring Russia's involvement against us in Afghanistan. She could support senators who are running against incumbent senators who voted for acquittal. She could speak to the inner circle process of security briefings. 

If Trump is looking more hopeless in October than he looks now—almost a certainty—his next move will be some military escalation or new conflict. National Security chops will be worth a lot at that moment. She's the perfect candidate.

Elizabeth Warren would cost Biden a critical Senate seat. Massachusetts has a Republican governor."
2536,2020-06-29 12:14:11,hhsodu,"Kamala would be a terrible choice, although she is looking to be the most likely. 

I think she could bring a lot of animosity similar to Hillary. I don’t see that with any of the other candidates.

She is very off putting. 

I would have loved a Warren/Yang ticket, although I’m VERY against putting people in major offices that have not held office before, even though Yang has an appointment by Obama.

I would have thought the “trump is a successful business man!” And “I don’t care if they have no experience!” people could be persuaded by Yang"
2537,2020-06-29 12:02:44,hhsodu,"Here’s 3 key lenses the DNC/donors are using to select Biden’s VP:

1.  Ideological compatibility. They didn’t fight off the progressive challenge in the primary to just hand the presidency over to them if/when the VP needs to assume a bigger leadership role in this next administration. So Warren is out. This is not my personal desire: just observing everything the DNC has done since 2015. 

2.  It’s going to be a woman from a demographic minority. Like Repub’s do with guns and abortion, the Dems have their own culture war issues they use to rev up the base. I know that sounds cynical, but prove me wrong. Again, not my preference but just observation. So that’s another strike against Warren. Whitmer’s out, too. Bye Gina Raimondo & Maggie Hassan.

3. Someone who projects strength. Electoral politics demands it of a woman. Who fits the bill? Harris and Demings can claim a “law and order” mantle as former California AG and Orlando chief of police. There’s a national security variety. Thats the central pillar of Rice’s personal brand. Tammy Duckworth has real cred here: seriously wounded as a combat helicopter pilot. But voters might balk at voting for a double amputee over this “strength” issue. And another way to project strength is via executive leadership. Interestingly, the only one of these women who’s a governor is Michelle Lujan Grisham (New Mexico).

Who checks all 3 boxes? Just 4:
*  Harris
*  Demings
*  Rice 
*  Lujan Grisham

How could the Dems parse these last 4?

*  Harris: Harris’ prosecutor career would make her a powerful surrogate on a range of issues from law and order to judicial reform. And she should be ideologically reliable with her votes as a Senator and family connections to MSNBC and Uber. But she’s never held executive office.

*  Demings: if policing reform becomes a central issue of the election then there may be no better running mate for Joe than a former chief of police of Orlando. But she’s only been in elected office 3 years and that’s not a governorship or the Senate. Just the House. And she may not be viewed as ideologically reliable on economic issues that matter to donors. There’s little to demonstrate where she stands on taxes on the rich, anti-trust, health insurance.

*  Rice: ideologically very safe with her close connections to monied power (she’s on Netflix’s board of directors) and the media (married to an ABC exec), but her personal brand is mostly foreign policy in an election with domestic issues front and center. And she’s never held elected office.

*  Lujan Grisham: potentially a little suspect ideologically, if you’re a pol/donor seeking economic status quo, with her kind-of-like-Bernie free college policy in NM and early support (2012) for raising the minimum wage. But she could be used to seal up the divide with the progressive wing of the party if that’s a priority. And she stacks up strong on executive leadership as the only choice who’s a governor.

EDIT: changed my conclusion!

The smart money is on Harris, right now. But I wouldn’t be at all surprised to see Lujan Grisham get the nod for one simple, toxic but undeniably relevant reason. She’s not Black. I think the Dems will be quite happy to check the person of color box with a Latina and avoid the closeted racism that’s still there among middle of the road voters. Yes, they’re that calculating. 

So I’m going out on a limb: Lujan Grisham. She just has to convince the powers behind the throne that she’ll be safe for their interests on economic issues."

2539,2020-06-29 15:15:29,hhsodu,I'm for Val Demmings. Strong lady. Former officer of the law. Absolutely ready to lead our country if necessary.
2540,2020-07-06 22:13:16,hhsodu,"I think that Kamala Harris would be a very smart pick for him. Not only is she a prominent senator and a household name, she is really good at bridging the gap between progressive and moderate democrats, which is key to the democrats getting a high turnout and something that Biden is not that good at in all honesty. She's much younger, from the other side of the country, and has a great resume and a history of leadership. I think what is going to win or lose the election is the progressive democratic turnout, as Joe Biden is already an attractive candidate to the republican who doesn't like the left but doesn't stand with Trump but a very unattractive candidate to a democrat that was really hoping to have a progressive in the White House, and as a team, I feel like they can get both of those bases"
2541,2020-06-29 18:49:10,hhsodu,"Anyone but Harris please. She is incredibly unpopular. In my battleground state during the primaries only 24 % found her favorable, 32 % found her unfavorable, and 33% hadn't heard enough about her. That was in October that those results came out. In November only 2 voters ranked her as first choice, comparatively Amy  Klobuchar  had three people rank her first choice, and Warren had 15 people rank her first choice and 19 people ranked her second choice.

2543,2020-06-30 21:56:29,hhsodu,"I *wish* Biden would choose Michelle Lujan Grisham, because he has not made inroads with the Latinx population.  I do not, however, think he will choose her. 

He *should* choose Tammy Duckworth, because she is amazing and hits *every* significant mark out of the ballpark.  I do not, however, think he will choose her.

He *could* choose Elizabeth Warren because she is uniquely qualified to address the incredibly heavy economic headwinds ahead. I do not, however, think he will choose her.

Bottoms, Bass, Raimondo, Abrams, Demmings, and Hassan do not in my opinion have the national profile and/or experience. And I don't think he will pick one of them. 

The positives offered by Harris, Rice, Baldwin, and Whitmer are in my opinion outweighed by their respective baggage, but I think he will pick one of them."
2544,2020-06-29 13:23:54,hhsodu,"The real question is whether we believe the polarization within the Democratic party is big enough that we need a left candidate to incentivize far left voters or if we think there's enough voters that want to jump ship in the middle. 

In the last election, the reason Democrats lost was because the Dems didn't show up, not because more people voted for GOP (Trump got same numbers as the previous election with Romney). Basically Democrats shot themselves with such a disliked candidate  that the BernieOrBust movement tanked the election; the GOP were never going to vote Democrat anyways so if there was more sexism, it's driven from within the Democrat party. This year, Biden doesn't have the same amount of negative emotions. If he picks a far left candidate, vs a center candidate, Democrats will largely still vote for him. 

With this reasoning, for his VP candidate, he will largely pick someone that is less likely to make Democrats stay home and is more likely to pull in undecided /anti-Trump GOP voters. My current vote is on Susan Rice, though Tammy Duckworth also works"
2545,2020-06-29 14:31:04,hhsodu,"I could see a big benefit from bringing on an VP candidate that is like an attack dog. 

Thinking someone like Warren or begrudgingly Harris. 

Trump needs a target to go after and the polls are already showing he is having a hard time attacking Biden in the same way the right attacked Clinton. I think having someone like Warren who can fight Trump's rhetoric 1 on 1 while sounding well spoken is a big benefit, that allows Biden to stay on his current trajectory of talking about his platform and by and large, stay out of the shit flinging contest. 

I don't think Biden is the best to counter Trump's style of rapidly throwing lies around and giving zingy one-liners, now do I care that he isn't the best at that style of politics. 

But having someone like Warren who I really want to see debate Pence, could be effective. 

And even if, according to /u/TEmpTom there is no:

>There’s no empirical evidence that a VP choice improves the electoral chances of a Presidential candidate in any noticeable way.

I still think having someone that reaches out to the 2nd and 3rd most voted for nominees could be helpful."
2546,2020-06-29 15:42:15,hhsodu,Warren because she would bring the most to his team in terms of governance.
2547,2020-06-30 09:36:58,hhsodu,"Right  now there are only 2 candidates I see as viable, given the context of  current events and Biden's lean towards picking a black woman.

1. Keisha  Lance Bottoms - Mayor of Atlanta, Georgia. A swing state in the bible belt that could  help win some southerners in this cycle. Mayoral experience may seem like a short resume, but Pete Buttigieg argued that mayoral experience makes one more qualified because executive positions require more leadership. Since Pete was once the front runner in the primaries, and Atlanta is far denser and more notable than South bend, this would be a good angle for Keisha to campaign on. 
2. Susan  Rice - Spent her entire adult life in the federal political sphere, and  is almost on par with Hillary in terms of experience. Again, since this  is an executive role she's filling, her knowledge of  internal/international politics places her uniquely qualified in filling  the VP role. The main issue is that she's never held elected office,  but working in 3 administrations has made her highly sought out for in  the world of politics.

I  personally would've liked Warren the most, but the bland reality is that  with current events, both black and white liberals would prefer a black  woman as vice president. Obviously, qualification supersedes all else,  but picking a candidate that also fits this criteria will only serve to  help Biden.

I know a lot of people  like Kamala Harris' background, but her track record will hurt the  ticket with progressives and young black voters. A California senator  from the east coast would also hurt Biden's moderate base."
2548,2020-06-29 05:37:07,hhsodu,"He needs to pretend that he never said anything about a black/female VP and pick someone people trust. His advantage right now is due to the fact that he is seen as a stable choice to replace Trump. He maintains this position by doing literally nothing that rocks the boat.

BUT, that advantage could evaporate in the fall if he is seen as too old/frail AND he has a VP that doesn't seem competent.

So, pick someone who is super safe. Don't limit yourself to female or black candidates."
2549,2020-06-29 16:34:18,hhsodu,Choosing by gender or race is not how to hire the best candidate. It's how to hire a token.

I’m telling you that, at the very last second, Michelle Obama is going to walk onto the stage at The Democratic Convention and accept the nomination for VP. It is then, at that exact moment, that Trump realizes that he is totally fucked and that he cannot possibly win."
2551,2020-06-29 11:20:20,hhsodu,"I know that she isn't on the list. But, Condalezza Rice should be the a consideration for the pick. She's a moderate, she can pull moderate Republicans. She's black and she's a she. She fits all the criteria  and has better potential than the others.

2556,2020-06-29 20:01:47,hhsodu,"Barbara Lee is the most strategic choice.

First, we have to recognize that the last five presidential elections were won by the candidate who focused on base turnout and lost by the candidate who reached for the center. Hillary in particular focused on suburban moderates and her strategy failed completely against the most beatable Republican nominee in decades.

Hillary lost because millions of Obama voters skipped voting for president or voted third party. These were primarily progressives, including black voters who showed up for Hillary in smaller number than they did for John Kerry. Obama-to-Trump voters were a smaller group than Obama voters who went third party or stayed home. Democrats responded to their failure in '16 by nominating someone even more conservative who alienates left-wing swing voters even more than Hillary did.

If Biden picks a white progressive like Warren he'll alienate the black voting base who feel they delivered him the nomination. If he picks a black centrist he risks the left staying home or voting green again.

Kamala Harris might work but her credibility as a progressive is shaky. She pandered to all sides and courted Clinton donors during her campaign. Her Senate voting record is short and her record as CA AG is controversial. Harris would be doing fine as a presidential candidate but Biden has very serious problems with the left wing of his party and Harris probably can't compensate for it.

That leaves Barbara Lee as the obvious choice. She's probably the most popular progressive black woman in the party. She boosts turnout among progressives of all races. She allows Biden to re-unite the Obama coalition and win in a landslide bigger than '08."
2557,2020-06-29 21:07:53,hhsodu,"Elizabeth Warren. It'd help bring in progressives, and would give Warren experience as VP to run for President next."
2558,2020-06-29 11:57:47,hhsodu,It’s going to be Harris. She’s a right of center recognizable name and the latte liberals love her. Demings will be an enormous mistake but she still seems possible.

2565,2020-06-29 15:57:09,hhsodu,"I’ve written a rebuttal to this a few times and just a few notes from that:    
   
Empirical data sounds nice and good but in the situation of how a Vice Presidential nominee helps or hurts it’s an almost impossible metric to measure because we will never know what the difference would be had a different Vice Presidential candidate been nominated. We all know Sarah Palin hurt John McCain’s candidacy we just can’t say by how much. We know Thomas Eagleton hurt George McGovern’s candidacy we just can’t say by how much.  We know that James Stockdale hurt Ross Perot’s candidacy we just can’t say by how much. And empirical data doesn’t answer those questions. 
   
But it’s also difficult to compare election cycle to election cycle. In this election cycle not only are we are dealing with two nominees in their 70’s we are dealing with the ideological direction of both major parties. Given Trump and Biden’s age and the fact that neither will likely be running for President four years from now it’s going to be their Vice Presidential nominees who could shape that ideological direction. For this reason the Vice Presidential nominees are likely to receive much more coverage than previous presidential general elections. Thus it’s really not comparable to previous elections.
   
Had Al Gore selected Florida Senator Bob Graham over Joe Lieberman would you bet Al Gore would’ve won the Presidency? I would. Had Hillary Clinton selected Sherrod Brown over Tim Kaine would you bet Hillary Clinton would’ve won the Presidency? I would."
2566,2020-06-29 13:48:47,hhsodu,"I agree with this but the wrong pick can hurt if its bad enough.  In this case, Val Demings.  While this will drive suburban and white turnout, you're going to see depressed turnout with young and black voters in WI and PA just like in 2016.  Joe is going to win the popular vote by at least 6 million votes, but to win its just a few counties in a few states.  The biggest part of that is keeping a strong coalition in AZ, PA, and WI."

Being that Biden boxed himself in by saying he will pick a woman, going by your metric he should pick Kamala Harris. Newsom would pick her replacement in the Senate, I assume they work well together, and she has decent enough experience."
2573,2020-06-30 10:04:38,hhsodu,"I disagree with the assumption that Kamala has a solid minority base. She did tremendously bad in the primaries, and dropped in December because her prosecutor record came to light. Right now she's polling highest among VP candidates, but I'm convinced that a positive record outweighs identity for minority voters. Its a big reason why Biden won the black vote in the primaries, and as soon as Kamala's record gets blasted by Republican opponents, any energy she *might* have had would become fragile in the face of glaring criticisms. In fact, her record resonating in the mainstream public might turn more voters away from Biden than help him.

At one point, [Warren polled higher than Harris](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/elizabeth-warren-biden-vice-president-cbs-news-poll/) before the Floyd protests, I think a strong record will resonate better for the black community than identity alone. In my opinion, given the current climate, Susan Rice or Keisha Lance would make better candidates than Kamala Harris. At the very least, neither of them have the luggage Harris has."

Editing to add: a quick google search tells me theres a large indian american population in Georgia as well."
2576,2020-06-29 12:59:23,hhsodu,"I agree that Kamala Harris is the best choice.  She’s relatively young (at least in national stage politics terms) so she adds vitality to the ticket.

She’s also an excellent speaker and presents very well on TV."

I'm fearful, because in 2016, I remember everyone was so confident that HRC went down to purple states, in an attempt to turn them blue. She ignored the Midwest, donald didn't, and he won because of it. Now is not the time to rewrite history, and ""turn TX blue!"" or whatever other dream someone has.

He was regularly regarded as the ""worst president ever?"", not just by opponents but by legitimate think-piece reporters also.

If a bad politician or low effort or no name politician is rewarded with a vp position it weighs down the presidential candidate like clinton's run was weighed down by tim cain. Its like the guy had to be introduced at every turn and ultimately that reduces the momentum. 

Like if biden picked harris, she is beyond capable of carrying her and biden's momentum. But her records are one of the worst for national level main stream politics. Despite her skills, her campaign tanked because there is no way to look away from her records. But if biden picks a no name vp in hopes there is no bad record, that weighs him down carrying a zero momentum character. 

There is only one option and its warren. Issue with that is warren's seat has some replacement issues and they have to find some way to solve it. They can make a deal with the repub governor to keep dem seat that biden admin would help out with with fed involvement later with aid and storms and stuff."

Personally I hope the VP pick is a little more progressive than crime bill Biden, but if I never hear donald trump's stupid voice ever again it will be too soon."

There is also the idea of signalling.  By indicating that he will select a woman, Biden has already signaled that gender equality is a priority.  By selecting a woman of color, it will further signal his support for racial equality.   Trump did exactly this type of signalling to evangelicals when he selected Mike Pence as his VP."

There is even some [recent polling](https://www.newsweek.com/kamala-harris-favorability-rises-biden-urged-pick-black-woman-vice-president-1509953) showing her approval rating and favorables improving as her name gets floated more and more (though it is true that Warren's numbers are the highest by quite a bit). Also, I have to doubt that her - or any prosecutor/PD - record on crime is going to be that much of a detriment. The far left has been hitting Biden as the author of the '94 crime bill for months and his overall numbers have held steady or even improved, and his minority support has been essentially unchanged. Suffice it to say that I just don't see enough compelling evidence that a Dem's tough-on-crime background is going to hurt the ticket in a consequential way, or at least in a way that can overcome the hurt that Trump admin and campaign is inflicting on his own chances."

I don’t think she would overpower Biden on the ticket and would be an additive choice that wouldn’t disrupt the campaign in a bad way. 
She doesn’t seem to have staunch ideological stances or overly problematic histories like some of the other potential VPs. I’m not sure if that’s a good or bad thing, but maybe she could be more molded by the campaign."

Demmings and Harris - Poor prosecution records. In my opinion, backgrounds matter more than identity for most people, this is especially true with minority voters. 

Stacey Abrams - Not enough political experience. If she had become Governor, she'd be a shoe-in, but without that, state legislature is nothing to tout for the second highest position in office. 

Tammy Duckworth & Lujan Grisham - People are looking for a black VP, though Duckworth is one of my own personal favorite picks.

Karen Bass - I don't know enough about her. Though honestly, I'm skeptical of anyone from California. It can very easily come off as another coastal city elitist pick."

Biden has overwhelming support of the African American population, outpacing Clinton. And while the under 30s may have supported Bernie, they're not a demographic who generally votes anyway. To spin the old idiom, a voter at the poll is better than two on chapotraphouse. 

Biden's in the uniquely enviable position of being able to watch Trump unravel; but taking the lessons learned from 2016, his best path to victory runs through blue collar voters, minorities, and moderates. Since it has been decided that Biden's VP must be a minority (by him or others) then Harris fits the bill. She has a net positive approval rating among bulk Dem voters, and despite all the internet hate, has been repeatedly elected to her seat in California. Since this election has been deemed to be a rebuke of Trump than anything else, Harris frankly doesn't do much electoral damage that Trump could exploit."

>An unknown in regard to big stage debate performance. 

Also true of most of the candidates on this list, and as long as they're not a moron I don't expect their debate performance to have any impact on the race. 

>No geographical pull.

Stacy Abrams, Kamala Harris, and Val Demings are also in this category, but I don't think the possible percentage point in a single state is going to be the deciding factor.

2685,2020-06-29 14:23:14,hhsodu,"To be clear, I’m not counting her out but I think some voters will. Most of them won’t say it openly but there’s still a stigma against the disabled as “weak”, “not complete”, etc.

But I can also see an alternate scenario where her status as double amputee becomes a badge of courage in a narrative that lauds her as a decorated hero who led soldiers into combat. That would put her right back into contention for VP. 

Plus, I hate to say this, but we all know there’s a chunk of Americans who see Asians as the “safe” or “model” minority. Avoids losing some votes to closet racists who may harbor misgivings about a candidate who is biracial (Harris), Latina (Lujan Grisham), or (clutch your pearls) African American (Demings)."

In any other year, I would 100% agree. But after reading a recent [*NYT* article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/28/us/politics/trump-approval-older-voters-coronavirus.html) (paywall incoming) about how older white voters are dismayed by Trump's presidency, yet are still up in the air of whether to vote for him,it seems that this year is different. From the article:

> Other older voters leaning toward Mr. Biden cautioned that they could still change their minds, like Frederick Monk, 73, of Mesa, Ariz., who said he had voted for Mr. Trump but quickly came to see him as “incompetent.”

> Still, Mr. Monk said his mind was not fully made up. If Mr. Biden chooses an overly liberal running mate, he said he could cast a vote for Mr. Trump and hope his second term is an exercise in futility.

> “Hopefully the Democrats retake the Senate and make his next four years miserable, if he lasts that long,” Mr. Monk said.

These are the voters that Biden needs, and they are more often than not in battleground states."

Quayle ruined Bush's reelection; Palin, given a brain, might have helped elect McCain. If Dukakis could have run a competent campaign, Lloyd Bentsen would have been a big help, but Mike made that a heavy lift. Tim Kaine did little for Clinton and that reflected poorly on her. 

Properly deployed, VPs can add a lot to the ticket. In this particular race, we need a VP who can carry half of the burden. (Personally, I believe that person is Susan Rice.)"

I had zero clue who Obama was and thought McCain was a good GOP pick. When he chose Palin I noped the F out. She was insane and too right-wing tea party anti-abortion.  I voted for Obama and moved much futher (in US terms) to the left."

There were concerns about his health, and if he passed while in office and palin took over....you get the idea.   


Again I don't think that is what lost McCain the election, and the vp in general isn't make or break, but it can have an effect. So given trump is the incumbent, and some important swing states in 2016 came down to very thing margins, I think Biden's pick matters at least somewhat."

I think you need evidence for such a bold claim. I see none. It's Kaine by the way.

She is a bona-fide badass, that's for sure. But she's fairly inexperienced with just two terms in the House and less than one in the Senate. She was also born outside of the US, and didn't live in the US until age 16, per Wikipedia, which will very likely come back to haunt her."

Personally I would argue that Val Demings, because of her exposure as an Impeachment Manager, has more name recognition than Susan Rice at the moment. Regardless of that Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris have an exorbitant amount more name recognition and really I think this whole thing comes down to the four of them. So yes in my opinion Susan Rice is at the bottom of the pack in that category.

Not true of the aforementioned three candidates. Harris and Warren have repeated debate exposure from their Presidential campaigns and Demings has experience as a Impeachment Manager.

Nonsense. You can direct that argument toward Harris and Abrams but not to Val Demings. Her and her husband are juggernauts in one of the most important areas of Florida to Democrats and she out polled Hillary there in 2016.
    
> I don't think conservatives will be able to get this one to stick. It's 8 years ago now and the media is too busy with protests, trump scandals, and COVID to give this much attention.

Right now the candidates aren't well known by the general public. After the convention, these people will be held up to the highest amount of scrutiny, and Kamala's black support can easily become weakened afterward."
2774,2020-06-29 18:33:14,hhsodu,I think Harris is a bad choice for reason's other than her record on drugs and prosecutorial power. She was pretty unpopular in the primary and didn't last long. She didn't do well at fundraising. I also think it would be a really big mistake to pick someone from California when she already isn't that popular. Like in my battleground state she polled horribly when she was in the primaries.
2775,2020-06-29 14:04:36,hhsodu,"Fair. How do you think she fares for an AG spot?

Surely, if there is a blue wave - which seems increasingly likely - it might be good for the democrats to have someone who roots out corruption."
2776,2020-06-29 20:47:57,hhsodu,">However, I've never seen her take a remotely controversial position on any issue. That makes her popular in DC, but a president needs to be willing to take political risks. She's an extremely play-it-safe politician from a state where she could be as bold as she wants to be.

From an electoral standpoint I don't think that will make a difference as a VP - perhaps at the top of the ticket, but I doubt it would matter as a running mate."

I sincerely doubt that it could be an effective attack against Rice"
2783,2020-06-30 05:09:34,hhsodu,"The Republicans already went full Bengasm and nutted on Hillary.  It's going to be pretty hard for the administration that permitted Putin to put a bounty on American soldiers in Afghanistan, abandoned our allies the Kurds to Turkish genocide and allowed Iran to become the largest power broker in the middle east - to get any traction with that stale story.

Susan Rice checks all of the boxes as a Black woman who is smart, experienced, competent and able to take over should Biden's health fail.  The only reasons not to chose Susan Rice are a) Joe Biden already has ample foreign policy experience and b) Rice is not politician or campaigner (which could be a problem if Joe doesn't seek a 2nd term).  But if not VP, Rice would be a good candidate for Sec. of State.

Kamala Harris is equal in competence and experience to Rice, but is more experienced as a politician and campaigner."
2784,2020-06-29 22:50:06,hhsodu,"She's probably the most qualified to take over as President on that list tho.  And considering how many republican investigations there were that found she did nothing wrong, and considering they blamed Hilary for it already it would be a weak attack."
2785,2020-06-30 11:47:03,hhsodu,"Well, let’s look at a real world example. Latinx.

This was a term created by whites to degender the Spanish language. Of course, to Spanish speakers, this feels like white peoples saying their culture is inherently sexist. Very few Latinos like the term, but it still gets pushed by white “progressives” who think they are helping Latinos."

2788,2020-06-29 15:27:11,hhsodu,"California is safe and Harris was a part of the very system BLM is protesting. What does she offer in terms of policy to reform the Criminal Justice system and what credibility does she have given she was the state AG?

BLM has apparently changed the conversation so Biden needs to pick a candidate to make the protesters feel represented, I don't see how a former AG responds to the issue of the day at all. 

She only seems like a response because she is black but her record and experience is one that supports the system BLM is protesting, not fighting against it. She was hurt by the system like all black people and chose to join it and enforce it. 

Hence it is a superficial response and offers no actual substance on reforming the way black people are treated by law enforcement."
2789,2020-06-29 23:41:21,hhsodu,"It did address what you said. You said appointing someone as VP who didn't ascribe to the demands of Black Lives Matter protesters wasn't going to turn them out to vote. 1. I don't even necessarily agree with that and 2. even if it is true, my point is, why should Biden necessarily care? 

Again ""Defund the Police"" is the same sloganeering we saw  with ""Abolish ICE"", ""Medicare for All"", and ""free college"". They expanded the imagination in terms of policy, but they are terrible to campaign on. Ultimately Biden and BLM protesters agree on the same outcome: respect for basic human rights and civil liberties but they are just choosing to go about what they want in different ways. Protests are important but government change will come from people in power who will change how things work and that requires votes. Biden is not going to sacrifice the few votes of BLM protesters for the votes of masses of Americans who want reform and not radicalism

The facts of her record is that it's mixed and to pretend that Kamala Harris is some modern day George Wallace in terms of hurting minorities is ridiculous, especially when she, along with Cory Booker and Julian Castro, pushed back on Biden during the primaries on the issues of race and immigration. It's her that's leading Democrats of policing reform in the Senate."
2790,2020-06-29 18:36:32,hhsodu,"It will be a woman, kamala is the only one that seems to be less likeable. 

Hillary was incredibly qualified, and unfortunately a lot of votes were lost because of some sort of extreme hate she garnered from so many people. I don’t think Kamala would receive such an intense reaction, but I’ve heard many people say that she isn’t as desirable as other candidates, even though she has good policy positions. 

I just want anything that will bring the most favorable position. The VP will be a woman, it’s just picking the one that will bring more votes."
2791,2020-06-29 16:19:05,hhsodu,This is INCREDIBLY ironic given trumps past dealing with China. The only way he doesn’t sell America off to China is if he can sell it to Russia first.

2792,2020-06-29 15:54:15,hhsodu,"I guess this is what I really don’t understand. I want to understand the perspective, but your description doesn’t make sense (to me)  and sounds like self-fear mongering.

- covering mouth. This doesn’t stop anyone from talking, there have been rare occasions where something may sound slightly mumbled but it hasn’t inhibited conversation at all. Do I love wearing them? No. Will I wear one for the *chance* that it keeps someone else safe? Of course. 

-kneeling. No one is forcing anyone to kneel, it’s being asked that the people who decide to kneel, on behalf of racial injustice, to not be crucified for it and is in no way related to covid or China. This is a perfect example of trying to take away choice...but it’s trump supporters taking away choice from those that decide to kneel. 

- don’t see the relation between a temperature check and a gun? This isn’t do-whatever-you-want-land. There are laws and rules to society, and part of that is protecting citizens, like speed limits. This includes Temp checks, although I haven’t seen any in person. If I were a manager, I would feel it is my responsibility to keep my staff safe if there would be risk of letting a highly infectious disease into my store/restaurant.  I also don’t understand how this is being subservient to have a temp check. You’re either a risk or not a risk. You’re not being asked for your medical history, which would be highly intrusive and likely illegal. 

- doesn’t the “selling off to China” stem from US manufacturers and business looking to exploit cheap labor?"

I see lots of pros with Rice. Her positions are moderate for the most part. A major con though, and it is a huge con in my mind, is that she hasn't run for any office. A campaign would be new to her. But she has been vetted before as Sec State (admittedly with a Republican congress) so there shouldn't be any major skeletons."

In my dream world, she's the Attorney General.  I'd entrust restoring the rule of law with her. I watched some hearings with her and how she dismantled people's arguments in real time and threw the fallacies right back at them. Tough cookie.

On the other hand, in a post-Trump presidency, that ability to read people and their arguments will be what's required when ""working with"" Russia and China. 

My worry is that I've never seen her debate with ""kid gloves"" on. She's a bareknuckle fighter who isn't afraid to get covered in her opponent's blood to uncover the truth. 

How does she enter a discussion with the leaders of Mexico and various Central American countries regarding the deported parents and caged children?  I don't want to see ""hearings"" Kamala Harris with that audience, though I wouldn't mind seeing that side of her when engaging with with the immigration employees who were ""just following orders""."

And Harris WOULD NOT be a response to BLM nor do I think most BLM supporters want the vice presidential pick to be the response to what we are protesting about it. Harris is a good choice because she is from a safe state so her replacement would be a D.

If Biden wants to appease BLM then he needs to change his opinion on marijuana legalization and increase federal oversight of policing civil rights violations. 

IMO (and I in no way represent all BLM protestors as no one does), Biden should just choose whoever he likes/best option for VP and focus on making a specific set of policy changes in the first 100 days that BLM has been asking about for years."

Black Lives Matter has embraced Defund the Police and even in many liberal areas considering widespread reform, that protestor sloganeering has been largely rejected. 

Both Kamala Harris and Val Demmings worked to get to where they are because they wanted to be in the room and add their perspectives when big decisions were made and big ideas were discussed. The multitude of civil rights movements in America were fought not just so people like them could achieve great things and open doors for others, it was to make people unlike them comfortable with them being in power.

Harris is traditionally qualified sure. She can do the job. I don't see how current protest help her case. Just putting black people in positions of power doesn't fix anything. They need to act in that power to make life better for their brothers and sisters. 

Just electing Obama didn't fix racism and a VP Harris won't either. You bring up that this is what white suburbanites want. This is why white suburbanites suck on race. They think any black person is the perfect bandaid to fix racism in the moment. It isn't. It continues to be them trying to dictate what will fix poor black communities and complete their white savior context.

The problem in America is not too many minorities in those offices and positions, it's not enough of them. 

I'm not even denying that she may have supported or been at the helm of policies that hurt minorities, Kamala Harris is human and just one person within a system who can only do so much to enact reform. And just as you can point to her mixed prosecutorial record, you can also point to her career in the Senate and her presidential campaign where she was one of the few minorities who spoke up on behalf those communities. When Biden was talking about segregationist Senators she was the one who brought the fight to Biden and she saw her stock rise because of that. It's Kamala Harris that is leading the charge on policing reform in the Senate on behalf of Democrats. Let's not pretend Kamala is on par with some others in power in regards to hurting minorities and reinforcing white supremacy. 

Even more ridiculous is to hold Val Demings and Kamala Harris to the standard you hold them to for being law enforcement *and then tout Susan Rice, who was one of the most hawkish members of Obama's national security/foreign policy team* as if the left doesn't bitch and moan about that the same way they whine about Obama or Biden or the Clintons or Kamala or even Liz Warren.

i think there's truth to it. the problem about the line-cutting is that it's identity centered and not centered around the discrimination the line cutting is trying to equalize. 

if you take the connection of women, job pay and women jobs. it's no secret the reduced earning of women is mainly due to the job they chose. but rather than improving the job pay (if you want to cut lines to equalize), women in mens jobs get the cut in line against men there. all women in womens jobs, but also men in womens job feel betrayed, also the men in mens jobs. 

if new lines were made that improved the position of formerly discriminated (be it generations ago) because of where they are standing instead of cutting lines in others, the others standing in line could chose to change lines. no feelings of betrayal."
2897,2020-06-28 23:42:14,hhlag2,"The best deceptions are half truths - and that's what this is. 

While admirable that this person assigns positive virtues to the lower middle class conservatives, /and a lot of those virtues are spot on) they aren't accurately assessing the motives for the negatives. At least not totally.

Here are some of their (and my) beliefs. 

The most sensical unit of a minority is the individual. The stereotype listed here, of those that exist, are clearly not 'well to do', regardless of the color of their skin (That we're still debating this and not seeing it as raciall discrimination - racism - frustrates me) and that should eliminate the failed attempts of equality of outcome. 

Striving as a culture for equality of opportunity of course makes sense, but at some point, the individual needs to take personal responsibility, and often: the parents of individuals, receiving government incentive and provision to split their family over the fight of the week or the girl/guy at work, leaves their children with an unbalanced childhood and directionless late adulthood in their mid thirties.

All of this is possible because 'I'm from the government, and I'm here to help' style compassion. 

What people are claiming is self-actualization, is actually the freedom to be foolish - with the result being exactly what you would expect of a nation of foolish adults: Civic destruction. 'Cancelling' those you disagree with because you haven't had to deal with them before. Global economic goals that are childlike in their simplicity - and fatal in their execution. 

The color of skin matters as much as the color of hair. It's a significant relationship preference. 

What does matter is your work ethic. Don't have one? You're useless to society, and a drain on the responsible individual's bank account through the tax system - which is quite literally a gun to the head of the working, responsible person - to support those that won't support themselves.

If you don't believe me on the race issue: These people contributed votes that elected Barack Obama. Those same people saw his failed policies, and elected Trump. Who is not a racist, by the way. 

This also explains their quick acceptance of people like Candace Owens and Larry Elder who share their values. 

It's not about race. It's about not submitting your speech to the mob, not self-censoring, and being the liberty to speak your mind. To be your own person. Don't like your reputation? Change it. 

The liberals are those who have been born into affluence, and don't understand the basic principles that make up the world. They spend their free time dreaming of a tomorrow that is not as bright as they would hope it would be, because people are not basically good. Especially not them. 'X is a right' can only be said by the people who do not work to provide X."
2898,2020-06-28 20:35:38,hhlag2,"I have been saying this for a while. The very idea of pushing ""diversity"" or affirmative action actually creates racists, sexists, and tribalism.

When you treat people unfairly or mislead the public you give power to some really evil people and evil ideas, you gave them a crack to grow in. Actual racists get to use the truth to turn people, like this story with terms and  ideas like line cutters, or they didn't earn that, or being anti-merit.

We can all virtually eradicate tribalism if we take away their ability to weaponize the truth. Sexism, homophobia, racism do not make sense and are not valid ways of getting to the truth, by their very definition and purpose they do not look at individuals only broad stereotypes or biases. But by giving some people advantages others do not you are pushing those without the advantage into a biased state of mind against the advantaged group.

It gets even worse when the general public says things like minorities cannot be racist, no women are anti-men, or many gays/transgenders cant be anti-straight or ""cis"" people.  Its gaslighting and it breeds divisions and pushback.

Conservatives really don't want that to happen because they're likely to go backwards in the line.

If you just joined the line at the back, you think the people at the front are stupid for not wanting the line to move faster, but in reality, they're scared shitless at the prospect that they could've spent 50 years for nothing.

(But still not mentioning that the people described here were directly slapped in the face by the party they had supported most of their life) It's funny to me people think that working class white moving from Democrats to republicans shows that race trumps economic interest and not that democrats have totally abandoned their working class base. 

Hilarious this is claimed as deep becuase it goes beyond just RACISM. 


Somehow it seems totally impossible for media commentators to understand that some people actually just believe the system we have now is working and when people try to change it they tend to cause more harm than the benefit they do. It seems to me that much of the left is impossible to see politics as anything other than warring identities and there fore they must retrofit that idea onto conversatives too.  

No. Some people just dont trust that people who promise to make things better, even when directed right at them, will actually do that.  And frankly they are right.  The progressive economic agenda of the 20th century has compeltely failed.   Instead of helping the poor raise into the middle class it has locked them into generational policy by creating terrible incentivizes. 

And people say but look at all the social progress that has been made.   That was true until he 60s.  And since then the progressives social agenda has been a fraud.  Sure a the the very top things have gotten ""better"" becuase a black man become president.  But for about 95% of black people things have gotten worse due to race targeted policies.  Sure women can be CEOs now, but again the vast majority of women are less happy than in the 60s because they are no ostracized unless they work and then put off having kids until they are 35 and then its incredibly stressful. The list goes on and on. And that just narrowly focusing on the civil right groups who actually did achieve equity in the last century. If you look at the fact movement to remove any social stigma for doing things that lead to bad outcomes  in the name of ""freedom""  definitional more bad outcomes.  It's hard for anyone to make a data backed argument  that life has improved due to the progressive social trends, other than civil rights, which btw was no opposed to conversativism, it was opposed to dixiecrats.

Also people seem recently seem to think that the republicans cant be a factional party when it obvious is. Democrats used to point this out but since they have now become explicitly factional on indentity lines they cant really point at the other party anymore. 


So tldr: no conservativism is no driven by resentment due to affirmative action, its driven by people who actually just believe different things than progressives economically."
2904,2020-06-29 07:00:14,hhlag2,"Yeah you can only use this if you start the analogy correct: white men had a seperate line that got them ""faster"" there, and suddenly they see all these others getting in the same line with them, going just as fast or in some cases others lines start to move faster.

2905,2020-06-29 08:02:13,hhlag2,"How I’d write the next chapter.

You’re furious now. Every time you try to point out the line cutters you’re told to be quiet but you can’t. You were raised to stand up for what is right, just, fair. You’ve had enough and step out of the line. You walk back past the long line of others, angry, bitter.  On your way down the hill, you yell at those still queuing and warn them it’s a joke, that their hard work, effort, sweat and tears are worthless.

At the bottom, you notice something, a crowd of people. You move in closer to see what’s going on.  There are all sorts of people, young, old, the full spectrum of diversity and they’re on their hands and knees.  Others stand beside them but they aren’t lining up.  You ask what they’re doing and one of the men turns to you and smiles.  “Helping them up,” he says.  You’re confused.  ""Are they helping those on the ground?"" Sensing your confusion the man explains.

""Many can’t climb the bank to get onto the hill. It’s a bit steep because the economy tug a trench to control the line. So some have offered to help.  They’re giving their backs as a step so others can climb up."" You shake your head, incredulous. “Won’t they miss out,” you ask. The man shakes his head.  ""No, after a while they’ll swap places with someone else then they get to go ahead and take their rightful place in the line.""

You look at him and then back up the hill.  “You mean all those line cutters came from here?” you ask. Well, yeah,” the man says.  ""Don’t you remember when you had help?  You shake your head.  “No, I never got any help.  I did it all myself.  I didn’t need anyone to help me get up the hill.""  The man checks his logbook, runs his finger down the page.  “Actually, he says, you did get help. “Your wife helped you while you got your degree.  Remember how she dropped out of college and worked at the store while you studied?  And your Uncle helped when he gave you your first job.  And your parents got help too which, in turn, meant you had a head start and got to begin your climb sooner than others.""

You fall silent and walk past the crowd.  You begin to wonder how you could have forgotten. Off to the side, there are more lines and more crowds.  People are jostling to get closer to the queue.  There are road barriers in front of some, mostly minorities and the young, others are struggling to stay on their feet as they carry children, some people have given up and sleep in the gutter.

It’s then that you get it.  You understand that privilege isn’t always something you feel or even notice because sometimes the privilege is not what you have but what you don’t have; like a disability or addiction, like extra responsibilities, mental health issues.  And sometimes it’s not having barriers placed in front of you by others.  You couldn’t see it before, didn’t know it was there.  You thought you got where you are on your own two feet but you didn’t.  None of us do."

However, it's sad to see that absent from the conversation here is any critical assessment of this story. It seems like most people take for granted that this vision of reality is in fact true. Sure, it's true in the minds of many people, but that doesn't mean it's not in part a fantasy.

* Are people in fact cutting the line, and if they are, what counts as evidence that they've gotten to the top of the hill before you?
* What evidence is there that this is a widespread social phenomenon as opposed to confirmation bias upon seeing a few lone instances of line cutting?
* Is the line analogy actually apt? We at least tell ourselves that in a capitalist society, a rising tide lifts all boats. This analogy does not fit neatly with the concept of a line where you must wait your turn to reach the top of the hill.
* What is actually at the to of the hill? Seriously, which metrics are used to assess that one has ""reached the American Dream""? Or that one can simply remain there once reached? Or that one has to wait in some sort of dues-paying time-spent line to get there?

Finally, and perhaps most troublingly, are we not willing to contend with the fact that the speaker in this analogy looks at his portion of the line, sees it filled with white males, looks behind him and sees the massive backlog composed mainly of the poor, non-white, and female, and that he doesn't question how the line came to reflect this composition?

The second is the trickier one, which is problems that cannot be solved without some pretty strong mandates coming down from the government, and that's obviously what's going to be harder to reconcile with the conservative mindset.

But, what I think the Left really had to learn to do is bring the Right into those conversations. Huge lesson I had in my alternative dispute resolution class is that people will accept an L so long as they feel like they got a fair hearing.

Unfortunately, we too quickly resort to the basic game of counting to 218 in the House and 51 in the Senate, and if we get there, fuck the other side and what they want. The right also does this, just to be clear, but the right doesn't seem to be flabbergasted by the fact that the left won't come along with them.

Imagine if instead of ""I want to put the coal miners out of business"" Clinton had instead invited a bunch of miners to a meeting to talk through the issue.

It might be them hired to work along side Jimmy Carter building affordable housing. Ask them what they want, what matters most to them, the other fallout closing a mine would have for their town and what might be done about it. Put that on TV, and Clinton might be President today.

Not necessarily; one would just need to assume that status quo is *closer to* that ideal than whatever the current crop of race-obsessed ideologues are pushing. Which is not a crazy thing to believe if the current crop of ideologues really are pushing for explicit racial quotas regardless of merit. If, holding aptitude equal, it is easier for the black children of elite Nigerian 1%er immigrants to get special privileges in admission to top universities than it is for the white children of unemployed West Virginian ex-coal miners for example, those former coal mining communities are going to have an understandable reason to be resentful.

>That's not the case , there still is systems/power structures in place  that give advantages to some disadvantages to others. The current drive  is to just get to a more just system.

Sure. So you need to make sure that the current drive for a more just system is *actually going to get you* a more just system. That involves being ready to investigate group disparities to see whether they are actually the result of current discrimination by the people determining those outcomes, and not seek to punish people for racism if the cause of the disparity is upstream of them. It involves investigating whether the disparity is the result of past racism, attitudes than not more than a Lizardman's Constant fraction of the population holds in the present day, but that could be addressed by some sort of outreach that involves trying to equalise present-day opportunity as early in the pipeline as we can, without punishing other people according to their racial group. It involves investigating whether there are other factors that account for the disparity, such as culture, that we do not yet have a good way of addressing that wouldn't make things worse, and then being prepared to not do anything that would make things worse in those cases. But when you have people like Ibrahim Kendi saying that non-racism is not enough, and that you have to be anti-racist (which turns out to have a much more radical meaning than the phrase would naturally imply), claiming that any difference in outcome is *axiomatically* the result of present-day racism, and that even suggesting making a good-faith investigation into *whether or not* that assumption is true is itself racist, that makes it a lot harder. When you have people like Robin DiAngelo burning the middle ground and insisting that white people must stop thinking of themselves as individuals and accept that they can have no identity separate from their whiteness, it makes it a lot harder.

>So yes if people see that and then turn to racist groups and support  them, imho thats just because they always believed that but up until  that point had no need to express it.

Let's go for a cartoonish extreme example. In the grimdark future of 2028, all the middle ground has been destroyed. There is only the American Nazi Party, who promise to protect people who look like you, and the race-flipped equivalent, call them the American Malema-ist Party, who are promising to genocide people who look like you. Who are you, white boy who only ever wanted to live in a world where everyone does their level best to rub along and treat each other as individuals, going to vote for when that sane option has been taken away?

Of course, I don't claim that it will actually come to that. Just that any movement in that direction is going to, at the margins, move some people who *would have preferred* to avoid racial conflict, to conclude that, sadly, racial conflict is inevitable, and make common cause with unsavoury types that in saner times they would have been keen to avoid. I don't understand why, if you destroy the middle ground and force people to choose between two sets of race-obsessed ideologues, and they choose the race-obsessed ideologues that are more welcoming to them, that should be taken as proof that they always were race-obsessed ideologues themselves."

2979,2020-06-29 00:29:18,hhlag2,"I agree with the idea that we should be engaged in more constructive engagement but where you see a lack of outreach, I see something uglier. Between Trump and Clinton, who had a more coherent plan to help lower income Americans? The answer is Clinton because she actually had plans and policy papers. She had a number of policies that were aimed towards Americans who are or were being displaced by the tumultuous nature of American capitalism (worker retraining and the like). 

Trump offered these people what can charitably be described as extremely low probability outcomes and uncharitably be described as a bag of magic beans. In some ways, I think it's interesting to see how politically, America is somewhat inverted now. In England, a lot of the working class still hate Thatcher for crippling the unions and mining in the North of the country, but at the end of the day, that was just progress. I feel like we're on the flip side now, where the so-called conservative party is trying to tell Americans that coal mining has a future in a highly developed country trying to address global warming. Just like the Labour complaints in the UK are fundamentally misguided (mining in Western Europe shouldn't be profitable), I think what Trump has told a lot of Americans (we should bring our jobs from China! Really? You think we want Chinese jobs...and Chinese pollution and Chinese working hours) is total BS? I actually found the documentary American Factory to be very illustrative on this point. 

I don't disagree that tonally there are and have been issues with Democratic politicians but that is equally true of Republican politicians, they tend to get away with it a bit more because their voting block is more coherent and over-represented in national politics. (That being said, I don't know how much this 3 legged stool will last because the business wing can't accept the religious/blood and soil folks bargain any more.)

I've been drinking Fin Back and Other Half. I live near both breweries so I just pick up what's on offer there.

I considered trying my hand in academica but my writing professor (who was quite successful) basically scared the shit out of me and told me not to do it. Senior year, I told him I was considering grad school for writing and he looks at me and says, Do you know what it's like to wait tables when you have two daughters and you're in your early 40s?"" Dude was nominated for a national book award twice too. In any case, it sucks that higher education is wasting its money on trinkets and doodads (brick lined pathways and a MacBook for every freshman) instead of paying the educators who do the important work.

Funny enough my grandma bought the same car after seeing how much my wife and I liked it. She hates trump but wasn’t down for Bernie either. She’ll vote blue no matter who though after being a lifelong republican. 

She also has good taste in clothes and like myself wouldn’t go to a club. I get to see her on Monday! I haven’t been in public or seen family in 4 months and I’m excited for my baby to see her great grand child. We’ll still do outside and socially distant because of her age...

The Democrats and Republicans have given us a choice between an Edsel and a Corvair.  In real life, you can also select a Honda, a Toyota, or many others, but in Obamaville Edsel and Corvair are the only choices offered.

As for what to wear to the club, Mom and Dad have only allowed you to choose between what you'd wear to church or to the opera.  For Michelle to suggest that November voting gives you anything like a real choice is highly disingenuous.

Fiwst, thank you fow agweeing to debate me.

Second, any pizza I owdew wiww be *mawe*. None of this “Ouw pizza identifies as twans-fwuid-pan-powy”—no. Pizza is a boy. With a penis. It’s that simpwe.

Now. With wegawd to my topping pwefewence. I have eaten fwom youw pizzewia in times past, and it must be said: youw peppewoni is *embawwassingwy* spicy. Fwankwy, it boggwes the mind. I mean, what kind of dwugs awe you inhawing ovew thewe? Pot?! One bite of that stuff and I had to take a showew. So twead wightwy when it comes to spice, my good man. You do not want to see me at my most epic. Wike the gweat white hewo of Zack Snydew’s cwassic fiwm “300,” I *wiww* kick you.

Onions, peppews—no, thank you. If I wanted veggies, I’d go to a sawad baw. I’m not some sowt of vegan, Cowy Bookew weiwdo.

Now let’s discuss conditions.

First, thank you for agreeing to debate me. Typically, in fora such as this, I am met with ad-hominem mudslinging, anything from “You racist creep” or “Is that your real voice?” to raucous schoolyard laughter and threats of the dreaded “toilet swirly.” However, your willingness to engage with me over the phone on the subject of pizza shows an intellectual fortitude and openness to dangerous ideas which reflects highly on your character. Huzzah, good sir. Huzzah.

Second, any pizza I order will be *male*. None of this “Our pizza identifies as trans-fluid-pan-poly”—no. Pizza is a boy. With a penis. It’s that simple. It’s been true for all of human history, from Plato to Socrates to Mr. Mistoffelees, and any attempt to rewrite the pillars of Western thought will be met with a hearty “Fuh!” by yours truly. And, *trust* *me*, that is not a fate you wish to meet.

Now. With regard to my topping preference. I have eaten from your pizzeria in times past, and it must be said: your pepperoni is *embarrassingly* spicy. Frankly, it boggles the mind. I mean, what kind of drugs are you inhaling over there? Pot?! One bite of that stuff and I had to take a shower. So tread lightly when it comes to spice, my good man. You do not want to see me at my most epic. Like the great white hero of Zack Snyder’s classic film “300,” I *will* kick you.

Onions, peppers—no, thank you. If I wanted veggies, I’d go to a salad bar. I’m not some sort of vegan, Cory Booker weirdo. And your efforts to Michelle Obama-ize the great American pizza pie are, frankly, hilarious. Though not as funny as the impressively named P’Zone—when I finally figured out that genuinely creative pun, I laughed until I cried and peed.

3057,2020-08-20 17:01:55,id3cko,"Shorter than any wait time Americans experience having to save up the money for that expensive heart surgery.

Seriously though, Americans are being sold total baloney regarding extended wait times. Over here, they prioritized the seriousness of your problem and work accordingly.

In terms of family doctors, it will depend on how he/she runs her practice and how well serviced your town or city is. My doc is available six days a week from morning to the late evening.

My first heart attack in 2011 ran like clockwork. I walked into the emerg department, went to the triage desk, waited twenty seconds, explained my symptoms, was immediately guided to a gurney, as a nurse attached an EKG to me. From there I was moved to another room and given two baby Aspirins. A call was made right away and within five minutes paramedics were there to transport me to an adjacent large city hospital.

I arrived at the hospital, immediately prepped for an angiogram. From there, I was told I had three serious blockages and that I needed to have three stents put in. I signed the forms and a doctor told me they'd be doing the worse one first. That was done the same day. Two days later they did the other two. I spent several days in hospital to recoup. My bill was zero dollars. 

My second heart attack in 2019 wasn't that much different. But this time it was open heart surgery for a triple CABG. I spent a couple of days in hospital waiting for my scheduled surgery. Went through the procedure by a doctor who's been doing these for over twenty years. Sent home, had issues with appetite etc. and put back in my local hospital to recover for a week. Again, ZERO DOLLARS.

No real issues with wait times. That's all a red herring argument from capitalistic rich people."
3058,2020-08-20 17:42:33,id3cko,"The US ranks 6th of 11 out of Commonwealth Fund countries on ER wait times on percentage served under 4 hours. 10th of 11 on getting weekend and evening care without going to the ER. 5th of 11 for countries able to make a same or next day doctors/nurse appointment when they're sick.

https://www.cihi.ca/en/commonwealth-fund-survey-2016

Americans do do well on wait times for surgeries and specialists (ranking third best on both waiting under 4 weeks), but that ignores two important factors:

* Nearly every universal healthcare country has strong private options and supplemental private insurance. That means that if there is a wait you're not happy about you have options that still work out significantly cheaper than US care, which is a win/win.

* [One third of US families](https://news.gallup.com/poll/269138/americans-delaying-medical-treatment-due-cost.aspx?utm_source=alert&utm_medium=email&utm_content=morelink&utm_campaign=syndication) had to put off healthcare due to the cost last year. That means more Americans are waiting for care than any other wealthy country on earth.

The links will give you detailed breakdowns for Canada by province."
3059,2020-08-20 14:03:27,id3cko,"That's probably why I ended up going somewhat ballistic on them because, as you implied, it was showing signs of confirmation bias which has nothing to do with real science. It's simply using the guise of ""science"" to push a particular narrative. 

They didn't like what I had to say, and I didn't violate any rules of that subreddit but they canned me anyway."

Does everything in America have to be about politics and how maligned the black population is? All the virtue signaling from the white crowd is enough to make a thinking person puke."
3062,2020-08-20 16:37:32,id3cko,"I can't speak for America but in Canada every second doctor or nurse I meet is from some designated minority group.

And why does anyone believe that if the tables were turned and a particular minority group became the majority, would they treat white people any better? We're humans. I somehow doubt it. Humans are predatory creatures. Within the top dog group are territorial alpha males would maintain power and status quo.

Look at all the other countries out there. Are any African nations egalitarian? China and Hong Kong doesn't even give a shit about their own people let alone minorities. North Korea is so lovely and fair they want you to give up your pet dog so other people can eat it. 

Until science can understand what makes us humans so bizarre and disagreeable, we'll have to accept some of the irrational baggage that goes along with running a country. I believe in equality of opportunity. Everything else is up for grabs."

3064,2020-09-08 17:55:00,id3cko,"The position claimed by the article is that medical treatment is worse for blacks. I've seen the same claims made about how women don't get the same quality medical treatment as men.

These claims are broad statements and can't be applied to every country, every State or Province or even every city. In the American healthcare model, money talks. No one is going to deny a black person a particular treatment or surgery because of race. That's ridiculous. Am I supposed to believe Beyonce gets worse care than Bruce Springsteen? Both have a ton of money and would no doubt get similar care. You can be sure the minimum wage earner who's white isn't getting better healthcare than Alicia Keys.

And as I was already saying, at least 80% of the doctors I've met (and I've seen hundreds of them in my years) are anything but white. I would have to think the same numbers exist in American and in Canada."

3066,2020-08-20 13:11:45,id3cko,"I second that. I've seen it in memes. When you think about it, he's right.

3068,2020-08-20 17:41:27,id3cko,">To read these studies, you'd think the white male has the best of all worlds especially in the health field. I'm a living white male and I've been screwed over or led down the garden path by the doctors I've had to deal with too (many of whom aren't white guys).

> I find it annoying and misleading to view medical outcomes strictly through the identity politics lens. It's the patients themselves that play a vital role in their lifestyle and diet decisions. No one can claim you can't eat healthy on a low income diet. Books are available for free at a library and we have something called the internet which even poorer people have access to. Depending solely on your doctor to guide your health decision, especially in the American pay as you go model, is stupid and unnecessary. Trying to lay the blame for the blacks' poor health outcomes at the feet of the whites is similarly stupid and unwarranted.

3072,2020-08-20 17:18:18,id3cko,"Ambulance fees vary widely in Canada. It may be $100 for you but it's $45 where I live.

My wife and I are on heart meds. They're all covered by her health insurance and the pharmacist doesn't change us a fee so essentially it's all free meds.

Dental is definitely an area that needs more assistance from the government. But if you take care of your teeth and/or have a decent medical plan from work, you can keep your costs down.

Mental health and counseling has limited coverage. It's not a perfect system but one that we Canadians are still very proud of. 

What's important is that the healthcare system we have is run by people, so variables occur. Outcomes will vary because of the budgets they are given, the hospital staff's abilities to deliver care, the workload they're under and so forth. Not so different from any hospital in that regard. In the end, we don't have citizens going bankrupt from medical bills."

But it's been handed out throughout history to just about everybody. Yep, even white people. (Look up historical data on white slavery.)

Do I think it's not a problem in America? Of course not. But it's also fair to say that the issue of ""class"" has also disenfranchised millions of citizens regardless of colour.

The political parties of the US are fractured into two polarized camps, neither one of which give a sweet shit about the average Joe. As long as money is the Almighty God, the poor will be at the mercy of the well off. 

Trump has done a good job of fueling discontent along racial lines, labeled ""the enemy"" and those that threaten the status quo as the ""outsiders"" and given notice that blacks who cause trouble in the streets that they will be dealt with using the unlimited power of its military forces.

I've been in hospitals and seen plenty of doctors in my life. Most of the doctors and specialists I encounter are non-white (my own GP is Egyptian). I've had lots of hospital stays and seen plenty of patients there getting the very same level of care as white people like me. The nurses don't treat you any better if you're white.

3091,2020-08-29 13:10:09,id3cko,"And Americans (in particular) need to look outside their own bubble and learn from other nations for answers. Michael Moore's movie ""Where to Invade Next"" is a prime example of how the initial values that built America were subverted over time while other countries borrowed those ideals and implemented it to their benefit.

Voting for ""Sleepy Joe"" over Trump is barely a step forward, maybe more like to the side. Does every eligible Presidential candidate in the US have to be someone born at the dawn of the invention of the telephone? In a world of supercomputers, biotechnology, and space exploration, does it make any sense to hand over the reigns of power to technologically ignorant Luddites or those professing belief in an invisible deity? I think not.

I'm not denying that racism doesn't exist. But to constantly see every single negative event that's ever happened to a person of colour as some racist infraction is a little ridiculous. Humans are a pathetic lot and history is filled to the brim with violent aggression, bloody battles and unfair practices. Does anyone seriously think that's ever going to change? If humans were rational, what would be the sense of oppressing a particular group of people? To the rich, a buck is a buck. What's the point of keeping people poor? There's no logic in having everyone wealthy either because wealth drives consumption and consumption is what's killing this planet. 

Instead them concentrating on race, it's time to develop a bill of rights worthy of a socially responsible and caring society. But that's at least a hundred or more years away and I'll have been dead and gone for decades. Even if every member of government were blacks, I highly doubt things would be much better for the working class. People are people and power hungry assholes only care about the tools that keep them in power and rich. I suggest you focus your anger and sense of injustice towards the one percenters rather than me. I'm just a lower middle class white boy who's tired of all the bickering whilst the elite are cracking open champagne bottles, cheating on their wives with hot hookers, traveling the world, screwing over the little guy."

3120,2020-08-20 16:53:30,id30cw,"I don’t have any advice for you as I myself have an issue with my brother in law saying basically the exact same thing.
The other day he sent my wife a meme that said Trump would forgive all debt, mortgages etc.  
He’s also said that after “it comes” whatever it’s supposed to be (he couldn’t tell us) that it’ll be beautiful, as in utopia.  Definitely according to him COVID is a hoax, masks are wrong, 5G causes cancer, and all that bs.  I questioned him one time about all this asking for proof of his claims. He got mad and said I was too dumb not to see it in front of my face. That’s what’s sparked me to be even more against it, learn exactly what this Q thing is, ( I didn’t know it was such a huge following at the time a few months ago) and question him more as I didn’t appreciate the remark. 
He stopped sending me this crap, but he still sends it to other people in the family including my wife but she doesn’t read it, just shows me and I tell her to delete it.  Unfortunately I think he’s already corrupted my younger brother and niece and probably his wife (my sister) but she doesn’t talk about anything if he’s not around. 
Frustrating that people actually believe this stuff, and they gobble it up like crazy. Some people have said it’s interesting, like a movie or something. Fucking stupid if you ask me."
3121,2020-08-20 05:38:46,id30cw,"It's also shocking that a far right cult is pushing debt forgiveness now. It's just a continuation of Trump co-opting populist causes in words only to stoke the poor whites. Actually as a whole, the Republican party has created a starved underclass with a refusal to up minimum wage or the overtime salary cap, and then used the discontent to bolster their new extremism.

If Qultists really want debt forgiveness, there's a whole other party who is pushing to forgive student debt and provide debt free healthcare. You don't need to believe in Trump Jesus and ""everyone is a pedophile"" in order to improve your life."

If there is plenty of money, money won't be worth anything at all. Value is based upon how finite a resource is. Simple supply and demand. - Response was unintelligible and made no economic sense whatsoever. 

Personally I wonder whether this is a way to get people who have no way of paying off debt to take out loans and use credit to buy goods and falsely boost the economy."

Here's a few of mine: 

Sarah Childress Polk: was very active in helping Polk, reportedly discussed politics with him and helped him write speeches. Famously remarked that ""If I should be so fortunate as to reach the White House, I expect to live on twenty- five thousand dollars a year and I will neither keep house nor make butter.""

Eleanor Roosevelt: perhaps a hot take, but I would wager she was the hardest working FLOTUS ever.  So many awesome things she did while working for the poor or downtrodden.  She famously required that only female reporters attend her press conferences, which helped these women have a solid job in an otherwise male dominated field.  There's also this [comic](https://www.art.com/products/p15063517836-sa-i6848713/robert-j-day-for-gosh-sakes-here-comes-mrs-roosevelt-new-yorker-cartoon.htm) showcasing the great lengths she went to reach people. 

Betty Ford: highly progressive and candid during interviews. Raised awareness about breast cancer. 

Barbara Bush: funny as hell, very likeable, and a great writer. 

Honorable mention: 
I don't know much about Grace Coolidge but her [official portrait](https://www.whitehousehistory.org/photos/photo-1-25) is one of my favorite White House art pieces."

DAMN GIRL"
3178,2020-08-20 03:44:57,iczcla,"The main clip of Obama's speech tonight that everyone is going to see is his scathing rebuke of Trump.  While everything he said is painfully true and stated more eloquently by him than anyone else could...the most important part of his speech was this:

""Look, I understand why many Americans are down on government. The way the rules have been set up and abused in Congress make it easy for special interests to stop progress. Believe me, I know. I understand why a white factory worker who's seen his wages cut or his job shipped overseas might feel like the government no longer looks out for him, and why a Black mother might feel like it never looked out for her at all. I understand why a new immigrant might look around this country and wonder whether there's still a place for him here; why a young person might look at politics right now, the circus of it all, the meanness and the lies and crazy conspiracy theories and think, what's the point?

Well, here's the point: this president and those in power -- those who benefit from keeping things the way they are -- they are counting on your cynicism. They know they can't win you over with their policies. So they're hoping to make it as hard as possible for you to vote, and to convince you that your vote doesn't matter. That's how they win. That's how they get to keep making decisions that affect your life, and the lives of the people you love. That's how the economy will keep getting skewed to the wealthy and well-connected, how our health systems will let more people fall through the cracks. That's how a democracy withers, until it's no democracy at all.""

Regardless of partisanship, everyone should read that and look inside themselves and realize that it is the truth.  I've had people ask me why I like Obama despite his mistakes and his flaws, and it's because of his fundamental understanding of America and the values that it is meant to represent.   

I know I, like many, have become more political over the past 4 years and I guess I can thank the current administration's ability to keep me constantly exasperated for that. But I'm tired of feeling ashamed everytime I see a rambling tweet or an incoherent press conference.  No matter who you want to choose, for the love of this country, please go out and vote this November...whatever it takes, and let's see what the majority of this country actually stands for."

Obama speech was not a Convention speech, it felt like an Oval office address announcing a State of Emergency for American Democracy."
3186,2020-08-20 02:54:08,iczcla,"When I attended the Women's March, the day after Trump was inaugurated, a girl held a sign that said, ""The first woman president is watching. And she is planning.""

It seemed so far away. But not as much tonight."

3191,2020-08-20 01:14:23,iczcla,Gabby Gifford's was a politician on the rise before she was nearly killed by a shooter.  It's inspiring to see how she has risen above the tragedy but I often think where she could've gone had that not happened.

This moment means so much."
3196,2020-08-20 00:05:08,iczcla,I think it is important to remind people the reason they are doing this convention virtually is due to the total and complete failure of leadership provided by the admin and the GOP.
3197,2020-08-20 00:04:19,iczcla,"Wow, Kamala is *following* Obama. They're both gonna bring heat."

SHIT. Trump is on the phone with ICE right now."
3199,2020-08-20 02:50:05,iczcla,"That just made me cry. I just had an emotional breakdown. After the years of misery, of the scariness and sadness it was hard to take that in. The first black man to reach the top and Trump tries and tear him down and degrade him every chance he gets. I don’t want to live in an America that is not a democracy. The worst part, realizing that tomorrow is back to the circus of hate and ugliness. I miss you Obama, I wish I paid more attention when I had the chance. Please vote."
3200,2020-08-20 01:50:05,iczcla,"I was no fan of Hillary, but she had the superior resume. Shoulda been President. I would have likely disagreed with some of her policies, but she wouldn't have driven the bus off the cliff. Thats for damn sure."

3206,2020-08-20 02:52:18,iczcla,GUYS! Trump is straight up fucking LOSING it on twitter right now. He is literally screaming and ranting and its glorious.
3207,2020-08-20 03:58:56,iczcla,Fuck it. I wasn't excited to vote for Biden but was going to do it anyway. I'm actually kinda excited to tell Trump to fuck off and put Biden in the white house. He wasn't the candidate I wanted. Not at all. But he is the right person for this moment in history
3208,2020-08-20 01:44:29,iczcla,Call me petty - Nancy ripping up that speech was gratifying as fuck.
3209,2020-08-20 02:11:34,iczcla,"Do conventions usually do this good of a job of talking up the candidate?? Because I'm starting to understand why the ""Convention polling bump"" concept exists, I think a lot of people are going to gain a newfound appreciation for Joe out of this."

3213,2020-08-20 01:00:18,iczcla,"Not sure how meaningful it is but my sister, grandparents, and a few family friends all saw Michelle Obama’s speech online (after Monday) and asked me information today about how to watch the event tonight when they heard Obama was speaking.

IMO I think this DNC is going to end up being a massive part of firing up voters that otherwise weren’t excited at all about politics. I feel like Obama’s speech tonight will have the same effect on people that Michelle’s had on people I know but tenfold. 

Fingers crossed🤞"

3217,2020-08-20 02:02:03,iczcla,"Pelosi is the most effective Speaker since Rayburn. 

If you want to see what she really excels at, give her a Senate majority to work with. 

This is an underappreciated aspect of what Pelosi has been doing. She used these two years to negotiate the compromises and put concrete legislation together. These bills that McConnell killed were derided as mere ""messaging."" But with a Democratic Senate, she can turn around and pass them again very quickly. With Pelosi as Speaker with Congress under unified Democratic control and a Democratic president to sign the bills, you won't see the flailing ineptitude that Ryan showed in 2017 (they couldn't even repeal the ACA despite unified control because they'd never developed a viable replacement). If the filibuster gets killed, you're going to see a Congress that makes the 111th (the most productive in 50 years) look like a warm-up act.

We need to win this election decisively, kill the filibuster, and De-Trumpify."
3218,2020-08-20 02:01:12,iczcla,God if Mitch loses election night. I may have to get drunk the first time in my life.

3223,2020-08-20 01:49:48,iczcla,Hillary is seriously tough as fuck. If people had been tearing me down for 30+ years I don’t know if I’d have her grit and persistence.
3224,2020-08-20 00:16:12,iczcla,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWynt87PaJ0

Need something to watch in the meantime, rewatch Barack's 2004 speech at the DNC.  It was apparent then this man was about to absolutely blow up.  When he gets going, look out.  I hope we get to see something similar tonight.  He will go down in history a one of the greatest orator's this country has ever seen."
3225,2020-08-20 02:08:36,iczcla,Hammering the Violence Against Women Act is a fantastic way to separate Biden from Trump.

3229,2020-08-20 01:54:53,iczcla,This speech really symbolizes the true grit of HRC. Imagine having the persistence to keep going despite being so hated by the opposition for 30 odd years
3230,2020-08-20 01:55:40,iczcla,"Hillary Clinton is giving a great speech. Honestly, she could’ve just said “I told you so” and stare at the camera stone faced for several minutes and still get the same point across."

3233,2020-08-20 02:48:32,iczcla,Well Obama’s speech both empowered me and made me feel like I haven’t done enough.

Damn."
3240,2020-08-20 02:01:08,iczcla,I am glad Nancy is equating Mitch McConnell with Trump.  That needs to be the central message of the Senate campaign.
3241,2020-08-20 02:08:17,iczcla,"Trump is a domestic abuser, accused of attacking and raping his wife Ivana. Contrast that with Biden and all his work against domestic violence."
3242,2020-08-20 02:10:51,iczcla,Damn I kind of liked angry Biden.
3243,2020-08-20 02:34:09,iczcla,"As Obama makes the case for Biden/Harris, it's worth pointing out that he was originally meant to be the last speaker tonight.

I support DACA. I’m outraged at how Trump has constantly demonized and dehumanized (often desperate) people for purely political reasons. Children caged. People crammed into horrendous facilities during a pandemic. All while a good many so-called patriotic Americans continue to benefit from the work of undocumented immigrants.

I became a US citizen in 2017, just barely missing the election. I’ve never been able to vote in a major election before now; I can think of no better time to finally be eligible. You can bet your ass I’m doing all I can to vote this disgrace—and everyone responsible for keeping him in power—out."

We find out later the RNC paid a close friend of the Trump family ten times the going rate even though they had no experience in production. It's clearly money laundering."
3271,2020-08-20 03:58:26,iczcla,"Obama was incredible. He is a hard act to follow. He was the highlight of the night.

3273,2020-08-20 05:05:39,iczcla,Obama's speech was pretty moving to me... He spoke about all Americans in a way that was inclusive and earnest. Where as I have never heard Trump speak about me or anyone even remotely like me with anything but derision and vitriol. It was a refreshing speech and a much needed change of pace.

It's not that Black people were considered 3/5ths of a human being. *They were property*. Like cattle (hence, ""chattel slavery"").

Blacks only counted as 3/5ths of a human for purposes of *enhancing slaveholders' voting power*. But they had 0/5ths of a say in the matter.

In other words, slaveholders were effectively ""8/5ths"" of a person.

The Electoral College is an integral part of the “3/5ths Compromise.” Without the EC, a small minority of property holders wouldn't have been vote indirectly on behalf of the entire population of a state, including slaves and free people without the franchise themselves. Since there was no meaningful loss of influence from restricting the right to vote to a narrow minority, voting rights were kept narrow in the South. 

It's long past the time to abolish this anachronism. And it shouldn’t take another Civil War, as the rest of the 3/5ths Compromise."

Here's a comprehensive list, of the things Biden is calling for. Many reasons to vote for Biden and to [vote Democrat and organize to elect Democrats downballot](https://www.reddit.com/r/VoteDEM/) too so that Biden can get as much done as possible

* [Sane Covid management](https://joebiden.com/covid19/): supporting testing, treatment, and vaccination, [ensuring that everyone has access to those things](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/510910-biden-supports-free-coronavirus-testing-and-vaccination-for-undocumented), ensuring all for workers have PPE, among other things. Plus providing support for workers, businesses, and the unemployed, including ensuring paid sick leave and expanded unemployment relief. And as sad as it is that it needs to be said, listening to the scientists and taking their advice, as contrasted to the current administration

* [Economic recovery policy](https://joebiden.com/build-back-better/): a plan to Build Back Better, with billions spent on kick-starting American manufacturing, union jobs, and R&D, to make sure more is made in America, as well as investing in [clean energy](https://joebiden.com/clean-energy/), [caregiving jobs](https://joebiden.com/caregiving/), and acting to [close the racial income gap](https://joebiden.com/racial-economic-equity/)

* [JoeBamaCare](https://joebiden.com/healthcare/): a public option, increasing ObamaCare subsidies, lowering the price of prescription drugs, and regulating against surprise billing

* [Climate policy](https://joebiden.com/climate-plan/): a green new deal with a carbon tax, support for nuclear power, and $500 billion dollars a year in green spending, and rejoining the Paris Agreement, in order to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2035

* [Education](https://joebiden.com/education/) and [higher education](https://joebiden.com/beyondhs/): free Pre-K and more funding for K-12 schools, plus Bernie's college tuition bill from the Senate, and providing student debt relief for lower income graduates

* [A $15 dollar minimum wage](https://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/04/29/joe-biden-minimum-wage-2020-campaign-pittsburgh/3622645002/), which was a progressive staple back in 2016

* [Worker's rights](https://joebiden.com/empowerworkers/): mandating paid family leave, bringing back the Obama overtime rule that ensured millions of salaried workers would qualify for overtime pay, taking California's ""ABC standard"" nationwide to stop gig companies improperly categorizing their workers as independent contractors in order to deny them benefits, ending mandatory arbitration clauses, and more

* related to the above, [Union policy](https://joebiden.com/empowerworkers/): various pro union policies, like ""card check"", the House PRO Act (which gives workers more power in labor disputes, increases penalties on retaliation against unionization, would grant hundreds of thousands of workers collective bargaining rights they don't currently have, and would weaken ""right to work"" laws), and defending public employee collective bargaining

* [Criminal justice reform](https://joebiden.com/justice/): eliminating private prisons, cash bail, and sentencing disparities, eliminating the death penalty, and more. As well as banning choke holds, pushing more focus on deescalation, stopping the provision of police with military equipment, denying federal funding to problem police departments, reigning in qualified immunity, and other police reforms

* [Drug reform](https://joebiden.com/justice/): legalizing medical marijuana, decriminalizing recreational marijuana, and scrapping federal convictions for mere possession. And with harder drugs, shifting away from mass incarceration, encouraging sending people who merely use various hard drugs to be directed to treatment instead of sent to prison

* [Immigration reform](https://joebiden.com/immigration/): giving DREAMers citizenship, ending the wall, ending deportations of non-felon undocumented immigrants, ending attacks on sanctuary cities

* [Tax reform](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/12/5/20995225/joe-biden-tax-plan): undoing Trump's tax cuts and implementing further tax increases on the wealthy

* Increasing funding for [infrastructure](https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/14/biden-releases-13-trillion-infrastructure-plan-070848), with a $1.3 trillion plan, including spending on green infrastructure

* [Housing and Homelessness](https://joebiden.com/housing/): a $640 billion plan to aid in housing, including subsidies to ensure that nobody's housing costs need to be more than 30% of their income, enacting Maxine Waters' *Ending Homelessness Act* to provide $13 billion over 5 years to fight homelessness and build 400k new housing units for the homeless, and the Clyburn-Bennett eviction bill to provide aid for those facing eviction due to financial issues

* [Foreign policy](https://joebiden.com/americanleadership/): rebuilding our alliances, strengthening NATO and the San Francisco system, pulling away from Trump's belligerent stance on Iran, and ending Trump's disastrous trade wars

* Elizabeth Warren's [bankruptcy reform bill](https://www.vox.com/2020/3/16/21181500/joe-biden-elizabeth-warren-bankruptcy(

* $78 billion a year on [caregiving](https://joebiden.com/caregiving/) for expanded childcare and homecare

* The Equality Act for [LGBT + rights](https://joebiden.com/lgbtq-policy/) to outlaw discrimination, as well as other policy to support LGBT rights

But Trump doesn't have the numbers. He barely won in 2016 (77,000 votes across 3 states) and did so as *more* of an unknown against a fairly universally disliked candidate (who was still far, far, far more qualified) who had an 'illegal' investigation opened up into her mere days before the election (and probably suffered from some sexism as well).

But he is known now. His malice and incompetence is known. He has not gained supporters and Joe, while not particularly inspirational, is *far* more likable.

They'll cheat. They're already trying to cheat through the Post Office.

And it's because he doesn't have the numbers.

Make sure to vote and kick Trump out of the WH and hopefully into a jail cell, after NY state (among others) sink their teeth into him."

3853,2020-08-20 02:43:31,iczcla,Is this speech one of Obama's best or has listening Trump warped my sense of how a speech is supposed to sound?
3854,2020-08-20 02:43:45,iczcla,"This speech would have blown the roof off the convention arena if Obama delivered this speech in front of a crowd. However, like his wife's speech on Monday night - it's so much more effective and powerful this way"
3855,2020-08-20 02:45:19,iczcla,Best political speech I've ever seen in my life.
3856,2020-08-20 02:45:43,iczcla,Ivanka is going to have to change trump’s diaper soon
3857,2020-08-20 02:45:59,iczcla,"You think Obama will be livetweeting during Trump at the RNC?  F no, that's for losers"
3858,2020-08-20 02:46:25,iczcla,Barack knocked it out of the park.
3859,2020-08-20 02:47:42,iczcla,That speech has me speechless.
3860,2020-08-20 02:47:49,iczcla,good gavel shot!
3861,2020-08-20 02:48:25,iczcla,The all caps Twitter rage from Trump right now in response pretty much says it all.
3862,2020-08-20 02:48:55,iczcla,I’m enjoying the procedural aspect of this convention for some reason.  I think it reminds me we could have a functioning government again.
3863,2020-08-20 02:49:34,iczcla,That speech was so incredible. God I miss him.
3864,2020-08-20 02:51:58,iczcla,Mamala.  :D
3865,2020-08-20 02:53:34,iczcla,"They got me two nights in a row. I cry every time I listen to Ady and the sheer contrast between these people and trump has put me over the edge again. These are real American people with real struggles, real lives, and real care for their fellow people"
3866,2020-08-20 02:54:37,iczcla,Oh man. Kamala is making me tear up.
3867,2020-08-20 02:55:40,iczcla,"If Biden wins, that could be the defining speech of our generation"
3868,2020-08-20 02:57:04,iczcla,"I love how happy she is. 

Also, VP of the US has gotta be the best job in the world no lie. I would rather be VP than president."
3869,2020-08-20 02:57:41,iczcla,I look forward to the Kamala/Pence debate
3870,2020-08-20 02:58:49,iczcla,Haha fuck the birthers.
3871,2020-08-20 02:59:23,iczcla,She makes Pence look like a wooden puppet collecting dust in an attic.
3872,2020-08-20 03:01:46,iczcla,“No vaccine for racism”
3873,2020-08-20 03:02:44,iczcla,You guys we can have an administration that believes global warming and systemic racism are real. Get out and vote.
3874,2020-08-20 03:03:23,iczcla,"Pence is currently curled up in a fetal position at Mother's feet, shaking and sobbing quietly."
3875,2020-08-20 03:05:40,iczcla,never forget that when Texans needed healthcare... John Corryn said that Texans could just use the ACA...
3876,2020-08-20 03:08:15,iczcla,Fuck Trump
3877,2020-08-20 03:09:00,iczcla,"Mother can’t save you now, Pence."

3880,2020-08-20 03:55:18,iczcla,So...Scott Baio & Kid Rock next week?
3881,2020-08-20 03:58:43,iczcla,The fact that Donald wasn't competent enough to keep a guaranteed money maker like a casino going without his daddy floating him money on the low will forever be funny to me. Literally all you have to do is treat people halfway decent and you should make money hand over fist. Especially in Jersey. But no. He couldn't even do that
3882,2020-08-20 01:04:50,iczcla,"Kamala and Joe we need you. Im terrified of another 4 years of Trump. Our freedoms, Our American way of life is at stake. Before people tell me Im being dramatic , fascist countries started out like this. Please get out and vote!"
3883,2020-08-20 01:10:08,iczcla,This is so heartbreaking.
3884,2020-08-20 01:16:27,iczcla,I’m desperate for an actual leader. One who has empathy and can show he is human.

3889,2020-08-20 01:34:27,iczcla,Fuck Trump

3892,2020-08-20 01:37:50,iczcla,They’re getting hopeful Obama out of the way now so he can go through an entire Trump diss later.
3893,2020-08-20 01:40:05,iczcla,I miss Obama so much. I'm sad right now. So very sad.
3894,2020-08-20 01:40:16,iczcla,"I don't know why, even though I am a seventh generation white-ass American - maybe because I love NYC so so much - but immigration stories are the ones who touch my heart. I think about them seeing the Lady Liberty and knowing that they could change their destiny. The people who worked hard and risked their life to make it here. The ones who relish what we stand for and what we enable. Immigrants make our country what we are and are the backbone of who we can become."

3897,2020-08-20 01:51:00,iczcla,People did vote. 63 million > 60 million
3898,2020-08-20 01:51:28,iczcla,I love her so much.
3899,2020-08-20 01:51:33,iczcla,"""Nevertheless she persisted"". Ha, how did Moscow Mitch think that line was going to go?"
3900,2020-08-20 01:52:06,iczcla,"""This can't be another woulda-shoulda election.""

It's pathetic, how few Americans vote. IIRC in South Africa when they had their first election where everyone could vote, 98% did. They appreciated the privilege."
3901,2020-08-20 01:53:37,iczcla,"My god, the amount of shade Hillary throws would put a fill tree to shame."
3902,2020-08-20 01:54:00,iczcla,Wouldn't it be so much better if she was President right now?
3903,2020-08-20 01:54:06,iczcla,[deleted]
3904,2020-08-20 01:54:55,iczcla,Whatever you think of her she's saying all the right things
3905,2020-08-20 01:55:07,iczcla,"I think that was a good speech from Hillary. 

I was skeptical, but she was really terrific."
3906,2020-08-20 01:56:17,iczcla,"If you know a Republican, check in on them. Pelosi and Clinton back to back is sure to cause increased blood pressure and an increased chance of heart attack."
3907,2020-08-20 01:57:35,iczcla,That was one hype intro
3908,2020-08-20 01:58:28,iczcla,How the fuck is Nancy Pelosi 80yrs old
3909,2020-08-20 02:00:29,iczcla,Pelosi fucking rules so much
3910,2020-08-20 02:01:05,iczcla,Remember in November!
3911,2020-08-20 02:02:07,iczcla,I’ve always preferred Nancy Pelosi over Hillary. She was on the right side of history when it came to LGBT Rights and the Iraq War which are things Hillary only did later
3912,2020-08-20 02:09:48,iczcla,Joe Biden was also led the push to get the first woman on the Senate Judiciary Committee.
3913,2020-08-20 02:13:27,iczcla,The RNC is going to paint the bleakest view of America compared to what the DNC has done.
3914,2020-08-20 02:14:17,iczcla,Saw some comments about Joes past voting record. He is willing to learn from his mistakes and has proven so. Look how progressive his agenda is right now. Bernie and Warren and all of us have helped him do that. Don’t vote on the past especially when the stakes are living or dying with Trump
3915,2020-08-20 02:15:42,iczcla,"Seeing all these former cabinet officials and administration appointees, and there's not a single big-dick-toilet inventor or oil company executive in the bunch. Fishing from different ponds, I guess."

3919,2020-08-20 02:20:05,iczcla,Aunt Bea is the GOAT

3923,2020-08-20 02:22:02,iczcla,“He failed miserably.” The way Warren said it hits different.
3924,2020-08-20 02:24:12,iczcla,Obama and Biden is like JD and Turk.  Friend love.

Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. In a career of public service spanning nearly half a century, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has left his mark on almost every part of our nation fighting for a stronger middle class, a fairer judicial system, and a smarter foreign policy, providing unyielding support for our troops, combating crime and violence against women, leading our quest to cure cancer, and safeguarding the landmark American Recovery and Reinvestment Act from corruption.

With his charm, candor, unabashed optimism and deep and abiding patriotism, Joe Biden has garnered the respect and esteem of colleagues of both parties and the friendship of people across the nation and around the world. While summoning the strength, faith, and grace to overcome great personal tragedy, this son of Scranton, Claymont and Wilmington has become one of the most consequential vice presidents in American history, an accolade that none the less rests firmly behind his legacy as husband, father, and grandfather.

A grateful nation thanks Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. for his lifetime of service on behalf of the United States of America."

3930,2020-08-20 02:30:23,iczcla,A real President dragging the fuck out of a bullshit President.
3931,2020-08-20 02:30:37,iczcla,I don’t know what I love most about this. The fact the speech is coherent or that President is wearing a suit that fits

Trump realizes he doing it live."

3935,2020-08-20 02:31:56,iczcla,Hot damn Obama is good at this
3936,2020-08-20 02:32:10,iczcla,"It takes a special kind of speaker to drag that orange fuck through the dirt, all while maintaining composure, class, and elegance."

I haven't felt this calm in years"

3941,2020-08-20 02:43:36,iczcla,This man's successor is literally throwing a tantrum on the internet while he speaks. Presidential internet tantrums should not be a thing.
3942,2020-08-20 02:43:36,iczcla,He's the best speaker on the planet. He's so smart. So real. So empathetic and so in tune.

3946,2020-08-20 02:45:37,iczcla,Michelle Obama and Barack Obama. The best part of 2020 so far.

3951,2020-08-20 02:47:03,iczcla,holy shit that was something else
3952,2020-08-20 02:47:29,iczcla,That’s a generational American speech. Kamala probably punching the sky that she has to follow that

The story we just saw of Biden talking to some random guy’s grandmother for half an hour - even *delaying an interview with CNN*, to talk to this complete stranger, is stuff he does, and has done, for decades. 

I can’t even say “compare that to Trump”, because there is no universe where Trump is capable of displaying *any* of the sincerity Joe Biden naturally possesses. 

How anyone can vote for Trump even now, is literally beyond my ability to comprehend. I stay awake at night wondering how - **how** - can people I love and respect, vote for such a depraved, bankrupt in absolutely all senses, monster.

I'll be honest, I haven't been the biggest fan of HRC over the last few years but I really hope she gets a fair legacy. She's had so much mud slung at her that I think people forget what a badass she is. I was just a kid when HRC was First Lady, but she always inspired me with her willingness to deviate from what was expected of the First Lady to fight for things like healthcare and protections for the vulnerable people in society. I still remember her saying something along the lines of ""I had a career before I had a husband and just because he's in public office now, I'm not going to end my career"", that's always stuck with me. There are few people on this Earth who have had their character attacked as much as she has and in the fact of that, she never gave up.

There may be some truth to that, in one sense: not since Jackson succeeded John Quincy Adams has there been such a sharp drop in presidential character as when Trump took the reins from Barack Obama in early 2017."

4561,2020-08-20 04:32:58,iczcla,"It's so weird to think of Kamala in hearings sounding like she's going to rip people's balls off with her teeth and in these speeches sounded like your second-grade reading teacher full of brightness.

Edit: I wasn't intending to sound critical, more pensive. It reminded me of watching a friend's mom yell at them and then answer a phone with a sweet voice like she wasn't just yelling at someone. More of a moment like ""Isn't it interesting what a wide range of stuff can come out of a complete, rounded person?"" I guess the underlying connector is they're both work related and how she has to present in a given moment. 

I don't know much about her personally but it was strange because in that first intro speech it felt like play acting, and I wouldn't want to be on her bad side, but when when she said stuff I wasn't thrilled with or on board with there was a kind of inviting charm to it. Like she started talking to you after landing a joke that is making her laugh in her own head and that lightness is carrying through her other different conversation with you. Or like there's something good she has to say but hasn't gotten there yet but it's coloring what she's currently saying.

Hard to articulate for me, sorry if it's coming out poorly."

4566,2020-08-20 06:29:08,iczcla,I was watching this live and as President Obama was speaking I was overcome with the feeling that we were witnessing a truly historic moment in American history: The first Black President has nearly half his legacy immediately erased by the most racist modern president and goes on to give the most invigorating speech of his career to preserve our democracy. ***goosebumps for days***.
4567,2020-08-20 05:19:17,iczcla,"This was the best of the three nights so far. I'll say it again (despite getting downvoted to oblivion yesterday), we need to hear more than the two talking points about Trump's coronavirus failure and Biden's empathy. The focus on climate change, domestic violence, and gun control were good points to focus on tonight.

Let's hope the tomorrow night ends just as strong as tonight."

4636,2020-08-20 01:57:59,iczcla,"The country would have been so much different and so much less shit if Clinton had won. On the brighter side, the election of Trump awakened something sleeping. It galvanized entire legions of new voters who were once apathetic. Young people became activists. The GOP tent closed off to many. I think 20 years from now, when we are WAY more progressive and the boomer generation has died off, we will be able to point at this moment in time as a big change."
4637,2020-08-20 01:58:39,iczcla,I admire Nancy because you just know she doesn't take any shit.
4638,2020-08-20 02:00:32,iczcla,Nancy is a polarizing individual in Washington.  You may love her or hate her...but she has an incredible knack at going after trump.

4656,2020-08-20 02:18:50,iczcla,God I wish it was Warren at the top of the ticket.
4657,2020-08-20 02:19:17,iczcla,Elizabeth Warren and talking about plans she loves.  Name a more iconic duo.
4658,2020-08-20 02:20:26,iczcla,I love listening to Warren talk. She reminds me of my favorite English teacher.

4665,2020-08-20 02:23:48,iczcla,Fantastic speech Warren! I hope she becomes senate majority.

4678,2020-08-20 02:30:32,iczcla,Holy shit Obama is taking no prisoners.
4679,2020-08-20 02:30:34,iczcla,Fuck. Obama dropped the hammer and burned Trump's ass. Shit!

4682,2020-08-20 02:32:18,iczcla,Sad Obama is really tearing me up. Like a disappointed father looking at his ignorant child
4683,2020-08-20 02:32:37,iczcla,There is zero chance Trump hasn’t thrown something at a wall watching this
4684,2020-08-20 02:32:57,iczcla,I always felt that Obama was going to go into the sunset after his administration ended. I’m happy he didn’t
4685,2020-08-20 02:33:43,iczcla,Obama is what a real man looks like. A real American looks like. A real President looks like.
4686,2020-08-20 02:34:40,iczcla,Obama is so good at this.  Still on another level.
4687,2020-08-20 02:34:52,iczcla,"Republicans: Your H1N1 response was a disaster! 

Said without a hint of irony..."
4688,2020-08-20 02:35:42,iczcla,"Obama and Hillary have given masterclasses on how to speak eloquently while also digging that knife into Trump. 

What could have been is heart breaking, but this convention has brought me some sense of hope again."
4689,2020-08-20 02:35:50,iczcla,Watching Barack Obama address to the Democratic National Convention from what he said swine flu and Ebola under control  with Biden unlike Trump who did not get COVID-19 under control. The main message is clear vote for Biden.

4692,2020-08-20 02:36:27,iczcla,We’ve devolved as a country so much in the past four years that he almost sounds like he’s negotiating for hostages.
4693,2020-08-20 02:36:36,iczcla,Obama could calmly talk me into running through a wall
4694,2020-08-20 02:37:04,iczcla,"Facts and science and logic, and not just making stuff up. None of this should be controversial... Republicans don't believe in these things."
4695,2020-08-20 02:37:19,iczcla,Jesus how did this happen to us. How did it get so bad? This isn’t my America. We need to get Trump out of office.

4705,2020-08-20 02:42:18,iczcla,I think Alice Walker said “The most common way people give up their power is by believing that they don’t have any.” That’s Obama’s message.

4707,2020-08-20 02:42:44,iczcla,Lmao the Cheeto is shitting the bed right now on Twitter. *eats popcorn*
4708,2020-08-20 02:43:27,iczcla,Having no crowd to interrupt every other sentence makes this speech so much more powerful.

4710,2020-08-20 02:44:01,iczcla,Whatever tiny member of my body that wasn’t sold on Biden is sold now. So fucking good!
4711,2020-08-20 02:44:15,iczcla,"Man, Obama looks like his eyes are glossed over with tears.  You can feel his anger and sadness through the screen.  What a terrific speech. Solemn, harsh, authoritative, but hopeful."
4712,2020-08-20 02:44:25,iczcla,"Nobody gets me, a relatively calm and collected person, angrier and animated at America right now like Obama is doing with a speech like a Red White & Blue maestro at a pep rally. God, I miss him."
4713,2020-08-20 02:44:42,iczcla,Barack Obama has a rent-free vacation home in Trump's head. I love it.

But then again, I'm not sure that person was able to understand Obama's speech past the first five words."
4716,2020-08-20 02:46:36,iczcla,That was incredible
4717,2020-08-20 02:46:47,iczcla,Lmao just saw that Trump couldn’t even wait until the morning before rage tweeting like a 12 year old who lost a match of Call of Duty.

5116,2020-08-20 03:12:15,iczcla,She certainly got that Howard confidence. She’ll need it for the road ahead.
5117,2020-08-20 03:12:28,iczcla,that was a wall to wall ass kicking tonight
5118,2020-08-20 03:13:29,iczcla,It's sad to think Inauguration day will be probably be virtual as well. If it's not. I'll be sure as hell to be in Washington cheering on our next President and Madam VP.
5119,2020-08-20 03:15:11,iczcla,Gabby Giffords spoke?! Fuck. I missed that.

5128,2020-08-20 14:48:29,iczcla,>Steven Bannon being prosecuted for receiving kickbacks on Trump's wall is NOT off fucking topic.
5129,2020-08-20 03:24:27,iczcla,"This week is all sunshine, puppies, unicorns, and rainbows.  Nextweek is gonna be all black clouds, gray skies, nihilism, rage, paranoia, and the grim reaper."

Fu-ck-ing bravo, DNC."
5134,2020-08-20 01:53:31,iczcla,"Damn, great job from Hillary highlighting some of the strong points from Biden’s plan. We are voting for so much more than removing Trump — we are voting for a progressive agenda."
5135,2020-08-20 01:54:35,iczcla,"This is actually an uplifting speech. I'm glad it's more than ""I told you so,"" though it's that, too."
5136,2020-08-20 01:54:50,iczcla,She's a way better speaker in this format than in front of a crowd.
5137,2020-08-20 02:05:55,iczcla,"Sometimes when I can't sleep, I get really high and watch SVU"
5138,2020-08-20 02:48:44,iczcla,Let's fucking go!!! That was a tremendous speech from Obama.
5139,2020-08-20 02:51:51,iczcla,Bernie Blue progressives: does the majority of you hold Obama in high regard today? I’m just curious
5140,2020-08-20 03:05:36,iczcla,Whoever is controlling the cameras in the production truck needs to be fired.

5143,2020-08-20 01:57:05,iczcla,"Young Nancy Pelosi was a smoke show. Hell, she’s 80 freaking years old now. How many 80 year olds look as good as her now?

Fuck, I said the same thing about 69 year old Jill Biden. 

Oof, I may have a GILF thing"
5144,2020-08-20 02:52:00,iczcla,"Had he been allowed to run again, Obama would’ve certainly beaten Trump and won a third term."
5145,2020-08-20 02:52:42,iczcla,Obama almost looked scared during that speech. Fuck Trump.
5146,2020-08-20 02:56:37,iczcla,"Sparkly eyes when she smiles, that you can’t fake when you’re a stone cold sociopath."
5147,2020-08-20 03:02:03,iczcla,"Really glad Kamala and Obama said Latino instead of Latinx. As a Latino, I find it so annoying when people say Latinx."
5148,2020-08-20 03:03:18,iczcla,"She could look like a tree stump and it wouldn't make her any less qualified, but I just want to acknowledge that Kamala is a very good looking person."
5149,2020-08-20 03:09:01,iczcla,"Look at Kamala smile, add natural inflection, be serious when it’s warranted. 

If Hillary had looked liked Kamala looks when she’s speaking from the heart, I believe she’d be president today.  That’s not to say Hillary is fake or phony, but she looked like a robot in the 2016 campaign. 

Kamala looks like a genuine person. A mamala."
5150,2020-08-20 03:13:14,iczcla,"Following Obama didn’t do her any favors, but she was good. She was articulate and hopeful, and most importantly, she didn’t give Fox any ammo for racist angry black woman propaganda."
5151,2020-08-20 13:26:24,iczcla,"There may not be a next election if Trump wins this one, and that should be at the core of everyone's voting strategy.

You don't have to like Biden. You don't have to think he's the best candidate for the job. You don't have to think he'll survive long. You can support his impeachment immediately after he gets into office.

But if Donald Trump wins a second term, he's going to set to work breaking as much of the electoral infrastructure as he can, with the help of other countries or not. Therefore, preserving your right to vote is a valuable issue and probably the most important thing this election."
5152,2020-08-20 01:52:14,iczcla,"Hill's necklace spells out ""I told you so"""
5153,2020-08-20 00:26:41,iczcla,Obama's speech will certainly piss Trump off the rest of the year and I'm certainly happy about that.
5154,2020-08-20 01:16:18,iczcla,"Not gonna lie, that was a power move. Going through a montage of gun violence, moms demand action reel, then a volunteer testimony, ending on Gabby Gifford."
5155,2020-08-20 01:16:56,iczcla,"i followed Gabby’s story after she was shot and every time i see her speak i’m in awe of how far she’s come. her recovery has been nothing short of inspirational, and i really hope Mark wins in AZ so he can continue to do the work that she would’ve been doing had she not been shot"
5156,2020-08-20 01:17:36,iczcla,"Tough decision. Joe, who is an actual nice person or the walking, talking, orange piece of shit?"
5157,2020-08-20 01:35:28,iczcla,"I feel bad for this little girl and her mom, but wtf did her dad expect? He voted for the “Leopard eating faces” party and is now surprised that leopards have eaten his face."
5158,2020-08-20 01:39:58,iczcla,"When Donald Trump is on his deathbed, the last thing he will see when he looks around at his family is greed and annoyance as they impatiently wait for him to hurry up and die. He will see absolutely no grief or love in the faces of his family."
5159,2020-08-20 01:40:24,iczcla,Oooh upbeat Spanish cover of Stand by Me I like it
5160,2020-08-20 01:56:37,iczcla,"Mark my words, Nancy Pelosi will go down as the greatest speaker of the house of all time."
5161,2020-08-20 02:16:33,iczcla,"Has Trump really endorsed Qanon? Good lord. The GOP is officially the party of conspiracy theory. It’s went off the rails a long time ago, but it’s truly sunk to a new low"
5162,2020-08-20 02:31:12,iczcla,the biggest dis track of 2020 since Tiger King wrote Kitty Kitty
5163,2020-08-20 02:33:15,iczcla,Can we do Obama again?
5164,2020-08-20 02:35:17,iczcla,"I just had an awful thought.

If Trump loses in November, he could run again in 2024."
5165,2020-08-20 02:40:42,iczcla,Barack just pulled the political version of an Eminem diss track.
5166,2020-08-20 02:49:03,iczcla,Damn what a speech by President Obama... I teared up and I don’t do that easily...
5167,2020-08-20 03:15:23,iczcla,"God she was miles ahead of Tim Kaine. I remember cringing anytime he spoke, and his horrible pandering. Kamala was way more natural and charismatic"
5168,2020-08-20 03:56:09,iczcla,Brian Williams gives no fucks at this time of night. Amazing.
5169,2020-08-20 00:01:27,iczcla,So far the Convention has been great.   Under the circumstances I think they made the most of it.   Obama is going to give us a powerful moment.  I have a feeling this might be him in top form in a speech that will be remembered.
5170,2020-08-20 00:05:17,iczcla,I'm ready to hear Gabrielle Giffords speech tonight!

5534,2020-08-20 02:36:56,iczcla,“None of this should be controversial.”
5535,2020-08-20 02:37:01,iczcla,I can just picture Trump getting red in the face and angrily devouring his 3rd big mac of the night while listening to Obama belittle him.

5553,2020-08-20 02:43:48,iczcla,For the Republicans: uninhabitable doesn't just mean that you can buy your way out of it.
5554,2020-08-20 02:44:21,iczcla,"I really like Obama saying our ancestors were the ones that didnt know democracy. Hes not only saying black Americans, he used catholics and muslims, people from different nationalities. Hes showing its a problem for all people to face"

5556,2020-08-20 02:44:47,iczcla,Douchebag Donnie does not approve of this message.

5560,2020-08-20 02:46:57,iczcla,Obama’s speech against Trump was the equivalent of the beginning of Infinity War where Thanos kicks the Hulk’s ass
5561,2020-08-20 02:47:09,iczcla,That was an amazing speech!
5562,2020-08-20 02:47:16,iczcla,Kinda hate Kamala has to follow Obama honestly. That’s a tough act to follow.

5580,2020-08-20 03:06:30,iczcla,Trump’s idea of putting in the work is rage tweeting while watching tv and eating hamburgers. This is the same lazy dumb sack of shit who had somebody take his damn SAT for him.

The VP’s job is to play the attack dog role.  Tim Kaine couldn’t do it, and we’re living the consequence. We need to see tonight whether Kamala can."

My views are very liberal, but I feel for those who are disenfranchised, who consider themselves conservative, but not Trump's kind of conservative.  Those who just want States rights (not just when the other party is in power), who want fiscal conservatism, etc.  Yesterday's Republicans.  I'm not one of these people,  but I know people who are. They are afraid to call themselves conservative because they believe they will be labeled racist, xenophobic, closed minded uneducated biggots. In fact some of these people are pro green energy, pro equal rights, etc, but just don't identify as liberal.  

These are people we want on our side, but we all too often aren't welcoming them in with open arms.  We don't need to shift our views more central, we just need to show empathy to those with differing views who might share our distaste for Trump."

They know they can't win you over with their policies. So they're hoping to make it as hard as possible for you to vote, and to convince you that your vote doesn't matter. That's how they win. That's how they get to keep making decisions that affect your life, and the lives of the people you love. That's how the economy will keep getting skewed to the wealthy and well-connected, how our health systems will let more people fall through the cracks.

7115,2020-08-20 02:01:27,iczcla,It's amazing how much easier it is to find female candidates when you don't make restricting their bodily autonomy one of your primary goals.
7116,2020-08-20 02:00:37,iczcla,Are you surprised?
7117,2020-08-20 02:04:24,iczcla,side by side group party photos make the differences glaringly obvious
7118,2020-08-20 02:08:38,iczcla,"I still am surprised women, gays, and minorities are Republicans.

Self loathing?"
7119,2020-08-20 02:01:27,iczcla,Yep and more are coming. WE ARE LEGION!
7120,2020-08-20 02:14:34,iczcla,"He can be a gaffe machine. But I do think that he is fundamentally a good man, and I hope America will see that and vote."
7121,2020-08-20 02:53:56,iczcla,ALL CAPS lmao
7122,2020-08-20 02:53:38,iczcla,And so are his cult followers. One of the reasons I don't even go to twitter nowadays.
7123,2020-08-20 02:58:21,iczcla,How amazing would it be to actually hear or even see Trump's reaction as he watches? Entertainment gold.
7124,2020-08-20 04:01:00,iczcla,biden was probably the bottom of my list during the primary but trump has got to go.
7125,2020-08-20 04:29:10,iczcla,[removed]
7126,2020-08-20 04:01:01,iczcla,"He wasn't my choice at all either, but given the present situation,  feels like a do or see your country die moment."
7127,2020-08-20 04:05:39,iczcla,Please go out and vote! The satisfaction of kicking out Trump will feel that much better.
7128,2020-08-20 04:13:11,iczcla,"i meam look at this way, pretty sure biden wont have a reelection campaign and kamela will take over for it"
7129,2020-08-20 01:45:32,iczcla,Symbols are important.
7130,2020-08-20 01:47:44,iczcla,Sounds petty awesome to me!
7131,2020-08-20 03:32:17,iczcla,Because its garbage.
7132,2020-08-20 02:14:18,iczcla,"It’s usually a bit different, mostly because it’s live speeches and audience reactions that are the benefits. The democrats got really creative, interested to see the RNC. They were planning to do it in person until a month ago. Not much time to plan something this elaborate"
7133,2020-08-20 02:14:40,iczcla,"Yes, but I think given the format they can setup these to roll one into the other more cleanly. A normal convention drags on IMO, this may serve us better. And I highly doubt the RNC will put something like this together even with advance notice, their productions rarely string coherent themes together (other than racism and misogyny)."
7134,2020-08-20 02:13:15,iczcla,"For sure, it's definitely part of the point of the conventions."
7135,2020-08-20 02:17:15,iczcla,"The determining factor is ""how many people are watching this?"" You can depend on a largely Democratic viewing base, but how many of those independents or conservatives are watching this and getting the warm and fuzzies about Biden?"
7136,2020-08-20 02:13:32,iczcla,Not always as pronounced. 2016 was a bit of a shit show with Bernie delegates openly protesting and yelling during others’ speeches.
7137,2020-08-20 02:14:44,iczcla,It’s usually this but with a convention center packed full of people in a very celebratory party atmosphere.
7138,2020-08-20 02:15:02,iczcla,Not usually. The format is really helping
7139,2020-08-20 03:08:42,iczcla,Fucking amazing speech holy shit
7140,2020-08-20 00:03:42,iczcla,Democrats need the treat trump as the bully he is.  They need to dismantle his false confidence.  They need to shoot down his fake power over everyone.  They need to pull back the curtain and brutally call him out for his obvious lack of competence
7141,2020-08-20 02:53:40,iczcla,Man that was amazing. Such an excellent and civil speech. He has Trump tweeting in all caps.
7142,2020-08-20 00:30:15,iczcla,And with Keegan-Michael Key as his anger translator.
7143,2020-08-20 00:56:19,iczcla,Have you seen the video of obama roasting trump? I’m convinced his entire presidency is because of it
7144,2020-08-20 01:03:53,iczcla,The last time I heard Obama speak was the funeral of John Lewis and he gave one of the most powerful and impassioned speeches I can remember. The bar is certainly high tonight.
7145,2020-08-20 02:52:08,iczcla,I'd say that surpassed expectations.
7146,2020-08-20 02:58:20,iczcla,Holy shit that was an amazing speech. And done live.
7147,2020-08-20 00:19:33,iczcla,Just repeat his burns from the correspondents dinner
7148,2020-08-19 23:57:27,iczcla,I miss Obama
7149,2020-08-20 00:57:19,iczcla,I hope Luther show up.
7150,2020-08-19 23:59:13,iczcla,It’s gonna be wild
7151,2020-08-20 01:01:57,iczcla,Also anecdotal but I had the same experience with my family.
7152,2020-08-20 01:12:45,iczcla,Did we watch the same convention?
7153,2020-08-20 02:09:20,iczcla,"Its gonna be a bunch of bravado, faux defiance, whining and guns."
7154,2020-08-20 02:09:14,iczcla,I can only think they will only use fear mongering
7155,2020-08-20 02:09:10,iczcla,But they got the MAGA hat kid
7156,2020-08-20 02:10:02,iczcla,"Lol I bet, did you see their speakers?"
7157,2020-08-20 02:11:56,iczcla,Herman Cain's supposed to speak. That'll be impressive.
7158,2020-08-20 02:10:16,iczcla,They'll just dog-whistle the entire time and their base will be ecstatic.
7159,2020-08-20 02:11:01,iczcla,"They don't need to.  Their base doesn't care about quality, or caring, or decency, or intelligence, or talent, or honesty."
7160,2020-08-20 02:09:07,iczcla,it’s gonna be the quality of a q anon video
7161,2020-08-20 03:44:21,iczcla,They do have Scott baio or whomever
7162,2020-08-20 05:13:40,iczcla,"I live in a Red State™ and I get Trump ads constantly. I always let them play because I like that I'm draining a tiny bit of money off his campaign in a wasted ad spot. Anyways, the Trump message and GOP strategy this year is clear: we are hanging on to society by a thread and Trump is the only thing holding it together. 


The irony of course is that the chaos they're showcasing to try and prove that point is the chaos that he and the GOP have created, and his voters will buy it. The Dems are more aggressive than ever this year with the most important message: Vote."
7163,2020-08-20 02:52:51,iczcla,yep. dnc did a great job humanizing them.
7164,2020-08-20 02:53:07,iczcla,Fuck yeah
7165,2020-08-20 02:52:46,iczcla,Yes!!
7166,2020-08-20 03:00:22,iczcla,"Honestly... I wasn’t until watching this week. Now I’m feeling the tingles I did during Obama’s campaign. I’m catching myself with a lump in my chest and hope again. 

I’ve felt it during two campaigns in my life. Bill Clinton’s and Obama’s. I couldn’t vote during Bill’s terms. I voted for W, when I could. I just didn’t feel it for Gore. 

I am not a party voter. I voted for Trump, I didn’t feel it for Hilary. I do for Joe. I did before and was disappointed he didn’t run in 2016. I want a human. I like Bernie. I supported him in 2016 and when he lost I was disappointed. Uncle Joe and Kamala make me feel warm fuzzies again. Plus she is a fucking badass. My repub girlfriend just told me between Obama and her... she’s faltering. That’s a win in my book."
7167,2020-08-20 02:53:01,iczcla,I’m stoked about Trump getting booted. Still not excited about Kamala.
7168,2020-08-20 02:05:05,iczcla,"And I see her and the Democratic majority in the House as mostly feckless.

They dont have a lot of power compared to the Senate, but what they do have, they arent using.  

Subpoenas, the power of contempt of Congress for examples.  I am tired of the Democrats being weak and just accepting people not doing what they are supposed to.

Bolton (for example) should be cooling his heels in a cell until he complies."
7169,2020-08-20 02:01:54,iczcla,I couldn't imagine going through 2020 without drinking
7170,2020-08-20 02:02:39,iczcla,That'll be the time to break out the Kentucky bourbon.
7171,2020-08-20 02:02:20,iczcla,"If he does, second time for me. And I will make sure I get blackout, rip-roaringly, two day bender drunk."
7172,2020-08-20 02:03:20,iczcla,I'd have to get Bourbon from the great state of Kentucky if that happened.
7173,2020-08-20 03:06:23,iczcla,"If Trump loses, McConnell loses, and Dems take back Congress in full, I will be hammered off my ass"
7174,2020-08-20 02:02:19,iczcla,I’ll buy your first shot
7175,2020-08-20 02:04:31,iczcla,if he loses i will get on an airplane and help you make this happen
7176,2020-08-20 02:23:30,iczcla,And I will happily get drunk for the eleventy-ith time in my life
7177,2020-08-20 00:05:32,iczcla,And Obama and Kamala are closing
7178,2020-08-20 02:55:59,iczcla,Fear. Nothing but fear.
7179,2020-08-20 02:55:48,iczcla,The Olympics of hate?
7180,2020-08-20 02:56:38,iczcla,We’re gonna see some weird shit
7181,2020-08-20 02:55:45,iczcla,It's going to be so disgusting.
7182,2020-08-20 03:00:30,iczcla,"Is Laura Ingraham going to Heil Trump again?   Yes she is.

7185,2020-08-20 02:59:48,iczcla,Imagine how white it'll be... The contrast should be fucking obvious to anyone.
7186,2020-08-20 02:55:31,iczcla,"Ordered my popcorn, but it hasn't gotten here yet."
7187,2020-08-20 03:00:42,iczcla,I sure hope they find a random plumber...

7190,2020-08-20 03:03:49,iczcla,"She’s been working for people her whole adult life even if they hate her. She was put through hell as first lady, she was forced to bake cookies and dress up, she has had an entire political party and their propaganda media empire preach hate speech against her for decades and she keeps on ticking. I wouldn’t be surprised if she served under Biden’s administration."
7191,2020-08-20 06:27:23,iczcla,"A few minutes into her speech my girlfriend and I looked at each other as it dawned on us that in a alternate universe we would have had Clinton at the helm of this God forsaken ship. 

Then we wept for the last 3 years and ate ice cream to feel better about things."
7192,2020-08-20 00:18:53,iczcla,For my money this is the GOAT convention speech. Kennedy’s and Cuomo’s were great but this speech made Obama a phenom.
7193,2020-08-20 01:37:53,iczcla,"Obama is effectively the Reagan of the Democratic Party, in the sense that most of us have such a reverence and memory of his tenure. I think millennials will remember him like boomers remember Reagan. Plus the fact that he was so young when he won, he’s going to be around for many cycles. Him and Biden will both be like the political grandparents of my generation."
7194,2020-08-20 00:17:49,iczcla,Thank you for the hype!!! Haven’t felt this feeling in so long... is this hope?
7195,2020-08-20 00:16:58,iczcla,Don’t mind if I do.
7196,2020-08-20 02:34:09,iczcla,I’ll never forget my very conservative dad turning to me in 2008 and saying “That man is going to be our president in 2008”. It was such a weird comment to me at the time but as I grew older it made so much more sense (as things tend to do lol)
7197,2020-08-20 00:53:33,iczcla,"Thank you! I had never seen that speech. Fuck, I have chills and hope. I think it’s hope, it’s been awhile since I felt it."
7198,2020-08-20 02:16:25,iczcla,"Watch his interview with Conan when Conan was doing a week of shows in Chicago

And then watch Conan launch stuff off a Chicago draw bridge"
7199,2020-08-20 03:10:54,iczcla,"Within minutes of that speech, I told my husband “he’s going to be president” and I followed his career from that moment on. Listening to that speech is one of those scenes I can see play in my head so clearly. Sitting at our computers, listening on Air America. We both stopped in our tracks."
7200,2020-08-20 03:14:17,iczcla,"I remember vividly seeing this for the first time and I told my roomates ""He's going to be president"". He was awesome"

7204,2020-08-20 02:59:15,iczcla,Looked straight at the camera and paused. Him and Kavanaugh both shuddered.

7206,2020-08-20 02:59:36,iczcla,I mean...she ain't wrong
7207,2020-08-20 03:45:57,iczcla,It was a callback to when she used it during the primary campaign. She knows the way in which Donald Trump preys on vulnerable people.
7208,2020-08-20 03:04:09,iczcla,That's Momala!
7209,2020-08-20 03:04:52,iczcla,Momela dropping truth bombs.

7212,2020-08-20 03:05:29,iczcla,I’m surprised she didn’t do better in the primary. She is impressive.
7213,2020-08-20 03:05:38,iczcla,That’s how she lures you in. And then she guts you.
7214,2020-08-20 01:55:21,iczcla,She tough AF
7215,2020-08-20 02:04:20,iczcla,"Not just the opposition, but your own party. I knew so many people who just didn’t vote in 2016 because they couldn’t stand her."
7216,2020-08-20 01:56:35,iczcla,"Forget the opposition. She got hated on so hard by people who call themselves Democrats too. 

She got punished by the Bern Unit."
7217,2020-08-20 02:37:55,iczcla,"If they had done a bit where it was Clinton watching herself calling Trump a Russian puppet in 2016, and everything she said that absolutely came to pass, while drinking a glass of wine on the couch in sweatpants, then turning to the camera and silently giving the middle finger, I would have been totally okay with that. She earned it."
7218,2020-08-20 01:56:29,iczcla,Pour a glass of wine and slowly drink it in silence.
7219,2020-08-20 02:04:23,iczcla,There are a quite a few of us who admire and respect Hillary immensely.
7220,2020-08-20 01:57:29,iczcla,Yeah she had a pretty damn good speech.
7221,2020-08-20 01:57:39,iczcla,"Two middle fingers... ""Fuck Donald Trump.""  Got up and left."
7222,2020-08-20 04:23:02,iczcla,"She could have launched into a drunken tirade, an expletive a second, and we would have all sat there nodding along."
7223,2020-08-20 01:42:37,iczcla,"You see, they took the data, analyzed it, and executed a plan to improve. If only that had happened in regards to an epidemic at a house in DC this year..."

7227,2020-08-20 02:49:43,iczcla,Exactly how it should make us feel. How we deserve to feel

7243,2020-08-20 13:02:55,iczcla,Needed Luther to translate
7244,2020-08-20 02:03:26,iczcla,"Agreed. Trump draws so much of the attention because he's so vocal, but too many people forget that there are 53 senators insulating him from consequences and enabling his dismantling of tradition and law."

7247,2020-08-20 02:12:39,iczcla,"Angry Trump is petty and kind of an asshole. Angry Biden, on the other hand, has a righteous anger, it feels more positive compared to the negativity of Trump"
7248,2020-08-20 02:12:22,iczcla,He's that scrappy kid from Scranton!
7249,2020-08-20 02:13:05,iczcla,I hope Biden learns from Hillary and can get mad and not be over scripted.

7255,2020-08-20 01:52:35,iczcla,It was Russian hacking. I studied the polls. Comey had no effect.
7256,2020-08-20 01:36:40,iczcla,I’m hearing this across the board and couldn’t agree more. It feels like “we” came together to put this convention together sort of..
7257,2020-08-20 01:37:49,iczcla,Most people are.  Seems like the majority want this to be the format from now on.

I wasn't expecting it, but I definitely needed it."

7265,2020-08-20 02:10:54,iczcla,That’s because the left won’t give him credit for it. All they wanna talk about is Anita Hill and Tara Reade.
7266,2020-08-20 03:06:24,iczcla,I'm impressed too cuz it has to be difficult and strange to have no crowd
7267,2020-08-20 03:07:59,iczcla,"good point, which is easily overlooked."
7268,2020-08-20 03:05:24,iczcla,There are people there
7269,2020-08-20 03:05:49,iczcla,"There's a few people there, socially distanced."
7270,2020-08-20 03:05:51,iczcla,There’s a few people in the Audience
7271,2020-08-20 03:05:53,iczcla,"To be fair, there are some distanced folks seated in front of her"
7272,2020-08-20 03:08:17,iczcla,Same
7273,2020-08-20 03:11:12,iczcla,"Oh no, you're gonna miss all the great speeches from, uh, Scott Baio and the pillow guy."
7274,2020-08-20 03:11:39,iczcla,"If they committed to sacrificing him to Cthulu live, I might tune in."
7275,2020-08-20 03:09:39,iczcla,He's talking all 4 nights - he must have demanded that cause his team has to know thats a fucking insanely terrible idea
7276,2020-08-20 03:09:30,iczcla,I almost feel obligated. It’s like when you become fixated on some one fucking up bigly.
7277,2020-08-20 03:10:19,iczcla,But you'll miss Ted Shits his pants Nugent and Chachi!
7278,2020-08-20 03:10:28,iczcla,"My mom wants to watch.

Im lkke, we know exactly what it js gonna be. Just more hate and lies."
7279,2020-08-20 03:09:50,iczcla,this is giving me hope.. I'll be watching the RNC to give me the rage I need
7280,2020-08-20 03:10:25,iczcla,No one should watch it so Trump gets low energy ratings. SAD.
7281,2020-08-20 03:10:40,iczcla,Yeah I’ll probably follow along on here and on twitter but I’m not giving them one view.
7282,2020-08-20 03:10:45,iczcla,I'm going to watch it for the sole reason that I probably would not believe the descriptions of it otherwise.
7283,2020-08-20 03:10:56,iczcla,I'm absolutely watching that inevitable shitshow
7284,2020-08-20 03:11:00,iczcla,Pointless to suffer through that. And There’s really nothing they could promise me to change my mind. They could even promise M4A and I wouldn’t vote for them because I wouldn’t trust Trump would actually do it even if he said so 200 times.
7285,2020-08-20 03:11:25,iczcla,"I want to, just to give it a fair shake and see how Republicans view things now. But I doubt I'll make it through all 4 days."
7286,2020-08-20 03:25:16,iczcla,"Unfortunately he was preaching to the choir.

It saddens me that 40% of the country will never give Obama or *any* Democrat a hearing. Partisanship is really unfortunate.

Mind you, I would never watch Fox."
7287,2020-08-20 03:25:30,iczcla,"I'm hoping it reaches a lot of people on the sidelines who didn't decide an alternate reality.

The 30% in the disinformation hellscape aren't willing to listen to new ideas or facts. They gone all in on their hateful death cult. Not sure you are going to be able to get them back."
7288,2020-08-20 03:21:37,iczcla,Bernie fans - “No”
7289,2020-08-20 03:21:33,iczcla,Only the leader of their cult can.

7291,2020-08-20 03:34:33,iczcla,"Well Pelosi had to explain the meaning of ""exculpatory evidence"" to him before the impeachment so I'm not surprised."
7292,2020-08-20 03:31:49,iczcla,"It had some big words in it. You know, 3+ syllables."
7293,2020-08-20 01:50:41,iczcla,"I'm so with you, friend."

7310,2020-08-20 01:58:40,iczcla,Anyone up for punching Trump in the face for the children? Maybe at least throw a shoe at him?
7311,2020-08-20 02:13:05,iczcla,I just wish more Americans were watching this.  So many swing voters probably aren't paying attention just like they don't pay attention to all the crap Trump is doing.
7312,2020-08-20 02:20:47,iczcla,Good eye!
7313,2020-08-20 02:21:27,iczcla,Good eye.

7321,2020-08-20 04:05:20,iczcla,"The DNC has been working on this for months - and it shows.  The RNC is a shit show with the changes in venue, NC to FL to a hybrid to back to NC for one day due to contracts and limited delegates to the rest being in DC in the... wait for it... the auditorium of the William Jefferson Clinton Federal Building....  (Aka Bill Clinton) and Trump making his acceptance speech at the South Lawn because ""he can"" since he's exempt from the HAtch act but anyone who works for him in a federal capacity will be committing a crime if they assist or partake in any way. 

Also RNC is believed to have gotten a permit fro the National Park Service to do fireworks at 11:30 PM after Trump does his speech and to be used in campaign videos."
7322,2020-08-20 03:57:17,iczcla,I have “We hear Trump farting and making a joke about it during someone else’s speech” on my bingo card.
7323,2020-08-20 03:48:19,iczcla,I'll tune in for that.
7324,2020-08-20 04:01:07,iczcla,"Yeah, I would have mixed up the order but Harris held her own.

Lyrics below:

Look inside, look inside your tiny mind, now look a bit harder
'Cause we're so uninspired
So sick and tired of all the hatred you harbour

So you say it's not okay to be gay, well, I think you're just evil
You're just some racist who can't tie my laces
Your point of view is medieval

Fu   fu you very, very much
'Cause we hate what you do
And we hate your whole crew
So, please don't stay in touch

Fu, fu you very, very much
'Cause your words don't translate
And it's getting quite late
So, please don't stay in touch

Do you get, do you get a little kick out of being small-minded?
You want to be like your father, it's approval you're after
Well, that's not how you find it

Do you, do you really enjoy living a life that's so hateful?
'Cause there's a hole where your soul should be
You're losing control a bit, and it's really distasteful Fu, fu you very, very much
'Cause we hate what you do
And we hate your whole crew
So, please don't stay in touch

Fu), fu you very, very much
'Cause your words don't translate
And it's getting quite late
So, please don't stay in touch

Fu x 7

You say, you think we need to go to war, well, you're already in one
'Cause it's people like you that need to get slew
No one wants your opinion

Fu, fu you very, very much
'Cause we hate what you do
And we hate your whole crew
So, please don't stay in touch

Fu, fu you very, very much
'Cause your words don't translate
And it's getting quite late
So, please don't stay in touch

Fu, fu, fu
Fu fu fu"

7337,2020-08-20 01:38:27,iczcla,Fucking hypocrite.
7338,2020-08-20 01:42:49,iczcla,"> My father is a conservative who has hired undocumented immigrants, and he STILL votes for anti immigrant candidates

he's voting for his self interests. immigration policies from trump and his flock don't really stop illegal immigrants it simply oppresses them and strips them of their rights so they'll work for nothing and be treat like shit just to survive in this country which means he gets to pay them nothing and let them suffer while he reaps the benefits. hello capitalism."
7339,2020-08-20 01:42:21,iczcla,"I don't know who he is, but he sings pretty well. That smooth sound that Sam Cooke had. I prefer Cooke's version, of course. Classic."
7340,2020-08-20 02:00:25,iczcla,I voted for Bernie but at least I didn't vote for Jill Stein
7341,2020-08-20 01:54:02,iczcla,I voted for Jill Stein
7342,2020-08-20 02:16:10,iczcla,GOP can’t show everyday people suffering because they’re in power and it’s their fault.
7343,2020-08-20 02:32:06,iczcla,He is a failure by every possible measure. Sad!
7344,2020-08-20 02:32:11,iczcla,Pointed out the obvious
7345,2020-08-20 02:35:53,iczcla,Oof. You gotta love it when someone uses projection to deflect from what they've done.
7346,2020-08-20 02:35:51,iczcla,I knew he couldn't keep his mouth shut lol
7347,2020-08-20 02:36:35,iczcla,I love that his all caps tweet is also a blatant fucking lie. He keeps telling it too.
7348,2020-08-20 02:36:31,iczcla,Haha what a loser.
7349,2020-08-20 02:37:20,iczcla,Fuck him - a real leader is speaking right now
7350,2020-08-20 02:45:28,iczcla,i miss him so much
7351,2020-08-20 02:45:44,iczcla,This is so moving!!
7352,2020-08-20 02:47:26,iczcla,I teared up.

7354,2020-08-20 02:47:22,iczcla,">We did that.

bullshit. WE voted for Clinton. Hillary got 3 million+ more votes than Trump, while Trump and the GOP enlisted the help of a hostile foreign nation to rig the election in their favor.

they cheated, they lied, they STOLE power, and are attempting to do it again."
7355,2020-08-20 02:47:00,iczcla,More people voted for Hilary.
7356,2020-08-20 02:47:51,iczcla,There’s a reason puppet barr can’t arrest Obama
7357,2020-08-20 02:48:41,iczcla,It's literally a child being caught breaking a rule and blaming you for catching him.
7358,2020-08-20 02:51:11,iczcla,I think she should just do that.
7359,2020-08-20 02:52:01,iczcla,"I mean, I couldn't be happier if she did that"
7360,2020-08-20 02:56:56,iczcla,I dislike her a lot for her past as a prosecutor but that would make me hate her a little less.
7361,2020-08-20 03:51:58,iczcla,The way that their family is so close is really inspiring. It's just another way in which Kamala is part of the larger American story... and Doug's ex-wife has been constantly cheering her on during the campaign right up to this very night!
7362,2020-08-20 02:52:12,iczcla,for Latinos.... maybe no??? ummm. no.
7363,2020-08-20 05:04:56,iczcla,Ooh ooh This would make a perfect gif
7364,2020-08-20 03:04:58,iczcla,I mean...she was an actual attorney general. I would hope she knew how to pluralize it.
7365,2020-08-20 03:06:07,iczcla,"Said the Republicans as they voted for Trump. But yeah, good point."
7366,2020-08-20 03:25:09,iczcla,They’ll be masturbating into the barrels of their guns by the end of it
7367,2020-08-20 04:13:36,iczcla,"I think it might be the first convention I've ever watched, & that's because I'm stuck in the house because Covid, CA fires & unhealthy air, & it's Hot here. So, I've always wondered do many people really watch? Do people from the other party watch?"
7368,2020-08-20 02:54:24,iczcla,I doubt it. They barely showed up at the polls for Bernie himself.
7369,2020-08-20 02:53:16,iczcla,It had no effect... but it was a great speech
7370,2020-08-20 02:52:33,iczcla,It didn’t.
7371,2020-08-20 02:00:56,iczcla,"You do not become Speaker to win popularity contests. You do it to win victories on bills.

I doubt Pelosi minds how much she's been disliked."
7372,2020-08-20 02:00:43,iczcla,"Without her the ACA wouldn't have passed, she is smart as hell, and a fighter through and through. She's not perfect, but she knows the system, and knows how to get results from it."
7373,2020-08-20 02:01:14,iczcla,She's a firewall for her constituents. She doesn't need to be popular nationally to get her job done correctly for her party. Absolutely my favorite politician.
7374,2020-08-20 02:01:51,iczcla,We saw with Boehner and Ryan how hard it is for the Speaker to control even their own party. The command that Pelosi has over her caucus is historic.
7375,2020-08-20 02:00:34,iczcla,Remember when that moron went on national TV and said you could blame a government shutdown on him.  What a dumbass.
7376,2020-08-20 02:02:15,iczcla,The Speaker takes the political beatings for her caucus. It’s part of the job. She’ll go down as one of the most effective members of Congress in US history.
7377,2020-08-20 02:03:19,iczcla,"Her efforts from 2016-2018 will go down in history. She had to do everything in her power to keep her coalition together and united, while playing hardball politics to prevent the Republicans from passing terrible bills."
7378,2020-08-20 02:01:24,iczcla,"Speaker is not a position where you get a lot of praise. It is like herding cats, all of whom have completely different ideas of where they want to go."
7379,2020-08-20 02:48:36,iczcla,Eh thats not how public opinion works for congressional leaders. They are lightning rods and have no reason to wirk on public opinion outside their district
7380,2020-08-20 03:12:55,iczcla,Its hard to imagine any other speaker standing up so fiercely for dems
7381,2020-08-20 01:51:51,iczcla,Or when he creepily walked behind her on stage?
7382,2020-08-20 04:17:08,iczcla,"Remember when the pundits said it was a draw, because Donnie didn't completely trip over his own dick on the softball questions he got?"

7384,2020-08-20 02:12:01,iczcla,"Yeah, that's how she won the Presidency!"
7385,2020-08-20 00:04:09,iczcla,People weren't impressed with Bill last night? I missed him
7386,2020-08-20 04:02:23,iczcla,thank you for saying that! Us Americans can use a little TLC right now :)
7387,2020-08-20 04:01:46,iczcla,This is cool to hear. If you don't mind sharing: where are you tuning in from?
7388,2020-08-20 04:04:29,iczcla,❤️ you inspire us as well hombre
7389,2020-08-20 01:43:19,iczcla,"I'm American and it has even given me more hope. I live in a red state and I know not all places are like mine but sometimes I find it really hard to have faith about the goodness of people. I've really enjoyed seeing the wide diversity of regular people who are doing inspiring things. I've known about most of the sad stories already, but it is good they're being highlighted too"
7390,2020-08-20 04:45:27,iczcla,No worries Biden and mamala will turn the American reputation around right quick!
7391,2020-08-20 01:49:30,iczcla,I kind of want to play it every morning to get pumped for my day working at home.

7397,2020-08-20 02:09:14,iczcla,Even today.
7398,2020-08-20 02:09:31,iczcla,Like an Amtrak train
7399,2020-08-20 02:10:48,iczcla,Not so fun fact- the first child abuse case acknowledged was in the UK. They had no department to handle it so the RSPCA was called.
7400,2020-08-20 02:13:57,iczcla,"Husbands could not be charged with raping their wives in America until a series of changes that started in 1978 and went through the 80s. It was a 'legal impossibility' built in to the legal definition of rape -- if it was within your marriage, it was outside the law."
7401,2020-08-20 02:16:25,iczcla,This is the sad truth. Heartbreaking.
7402,2020-08-20 02:19:18,iczcla,Ah good eye

7410,2020-08-20 02:31:43,iczcla,No.  But then again there has never been as shiity of a president as 45
7411,2020-08-20 02:31:57,iczcla,I am 55 and have never heard it..
7412,2020-08-20 02:31:47,iczcla,Not in modern history that I'm aware of
7413,2020-08-20 02:32:21,iczcla,I don't think so.  But Obama has held his tongue long enough.
7414,2020-08-20 02:34:38,iczcla,There was Teddy running third party against Taft. That's pretty much it.
7415,2020-08-20 02:35:49,iczcla,The kicked dog howls.
7416,2020-08-20 02:35:46,iczcla,can't help himself
7417,2020-08-20 02:36:20,iczcla,You love to see it
7418,2020-08-20 02:36:12,iczcla, Is that the best he can offer? lmao
7419,2020-08-20 02:36:10,iczcla,and his twits are so predictable and false
7420,2020-08-20 02:36:30,iczcla,Toddler throwing a tantrum. Wonder if Invanka has changed his diaper.
7421,2020-08-20 02:50:48,iczcla,"What a pathetic , predictable loser"
7422,2020-08-20 02:36:11,iczcla,Kennedy is a good comparision. It's up to Biden to be the LBJ
7423,2020-08-20 02:35:48,iczcla,Who himself was a flawed president himself.
7424,2020-08-20 02:36:06,iczcla,All people are flawed.
7425,2020-08-20 02:40:04,iczcla,Of all time
7426,2020-08-20 02:35:41,iczcla,Are we just gonna forget LBJ?
7427,2020-08-20 02:37:13,iczcla,He's such a fucking baby.
7428,2020-08-20 02:37:19,iczcla,love it so much!
7429,2020-08-20 02:37:37,iczcla,"I was wrong, he started before the speech even ended!"
7430,2020-08-20 02:37:50,iczcla,"Hah! Suck it, Donald. This is what a *real* president looks like."
7431,2020-08-20 02:39:11,iczcla,Lmao you were talking to foreign interests you have no idea how Intel works that's why you stopped going to briefs
7432,2020-08-20 02:38:54,iczcla,"So has Hillary, they have dropped the pretences"
7433,2020-08-20 02:39:09,iczcla,Less stress.
7434,2020-08-20 02:38:50,iczcla,"Less pressure / more time to prepare  


Imagine having to be ""on game"" every second of every day. That would be tiring"
7435,2020-08-20 02:37:45,iczcla,"Like a fine wine, he just gets better with age"
7436,2020-08-20 02:38:10,iczcla,Less pressure when you're not being told all the things that are problems 18 hours a day.
7437,2020-08-20 02:38:42,iczcla,I think we all feel that way only because a clown has given so many fucking awful speeches at the office for the past 4 years lmao
7438,2020-08-20 02:38:50,iczcla,He's saved all his speeches for this one Salvo.
7439,2020-08-20 02:45:06,iczcla,Racism is a hell of a drug
7440,2020-08-20 02:49:13,iczcla,"Recall it was 40k votes in three states.  


3 MILLION more votes against Trump.  


This country is not as dumb as you think. We got this. Go vote, Go Volunteer!"
7441,2020-08-20 05:00:34,iczcla,"Remember though, can’t really help it if the morally corrupt electoral college steals the vote away from the American people"
7442,2020-08-20 02:56:01,iczcla,Representation is fantastic. It’s so nice to see people that look like me in different roles on TV rather than just a TV show.
7443,2020-08-20 02:54:47,iczcla,"I'm not little nor a girl but when I saw those scenes, I felt it. The senator also looks like me for whatever it's worth but yeah as a man in his 30s you sometimes miss how meaningful this is to our young women and girls growing up America today and seeing this."
7444,2020-08-20 02:56:00,iczcla,"A Black man who is smarter, more eloquent, more qualified, and who can take him out."
7445,2020-08-20 03:01:52,iczcla,"You made me check Twitter.

You are a bad person for that.

(Spoiler) - It was fucking hilarious!"
7446,2020-08-20 02:58:26,iczcla,"Already?! Yeah, scratch that, we all know the answer. Fuck that narcissistic lunatic."
7447,2020-08-20 02:56:23,iczcla,Good. Fuck trump.
7448,2020-08-20 03:02:27,iczcla,"So, Wednesday?"
7449,2020-08-20 04:30:51,iczcla,"If he does then he won't have to worry about winning an election. He'll have more pressing matters, like being charged with war crimes and being sanctioned without mercy.

&#x200B;

The GOP will never let him do that though. Most of them are smart enough to realize just how stupid a move that would be right now. Barr or Miller will talk him down and then he'll forget all about that notion. At least until the next fiery speech."
7450,2020-08-20 03:03:53,iczcla,Obama is a really hard act to follow for speeches; she's doing great.
7451,2020-08-20 03:04:01,iczcla,She seems real. I know what you’re saying.
7452,2020-08-20 03:05:41,iczcla,"""Mother, I am going to use the restroom."""
7453,2020-08-20 03:08:12,iczcla,I don't think Mother let's him watch other women on TV.
7454,2020-08-20 03:06:43,iczcla,Bet he focuses on god. Talks about how holy and saved he and trump are and how Biden and kamala will want to stop the country from putting up Christmas decorations
7455,2020-08-20 03:06:21,iczcla,Mother watching Mike Pence watching Kamala
7456,2020-08-20 03:06:48,iczcla,Only if Mother lets him on the stage
7457,2020-08-20 03:06:14,iczcla,shitting bricks
7458,2020-08-20 03:06:26,iczcla,He’s gotta get his wife’s permission first
7459,2020-08-20 03:07:28,iczcla,"I mean she got destroyed by Tulsi, not exactly an amazing debater."
7460,2020-08-20 03:06:31,iczcla,He is mesmerizing.
7461,2020-08-20 03:07:55,iczcla,I miss that man so much.
7462,2020-08-20 03:12:01,iczcla,Same. It's like an overload. Obama's speech was one that will be in the history books of great speeches.
7463,2020-08-20 03:07:37,iczcla,It has been a breath of fresh air for me.
7464,2020-08-20 03:09:51,iczcla,I hope she remembers her time living there and brings a little bit of that on down to the US.
7465,2020-08-20 03:08:33,iczcla,Yeah. I feel like people can relate to the nervousness. I don't think it's a bad thing.
7466,2020-08-20 03:09:18,iczcla,She seems super comfortable to me
7467,2020-08-20 03:12:38,iczcla,She convinced me she is a leader
7468,2020-08-20 03:11:33,iczcla,Take back patriotism from the traitors using our patriotism against us.
7469,2020-08-20 03:11:25,iczcla,Holy cow what a disaster that would be. I mean she can do her thing and I appreciate that her state loves her leadership but I couldn’t get enthusiastic about her.
7470,2020-08-20 03:10:50,iczcla,For real lol
7471,2020-08-20 03:11:21,iczcla,I don't get what Boomers see in her
7472,2020-08-20 03:14:40,iczcla,Jfc amen
7473,2020-08-20 03:12:36,iczcla,That would've made Tim Kaine look like a good idea
7474,2020-08-20 03:26:44,iczcla,fucking boomed em
7475,2020-08-20 03:37:21,iczcla,Lmfao
7476,2020-08-20 03:29:54,iczcla,They had a single commercial break on most stations.
7477,2020-08-20 03:29:18,iczcla,exactly this
7478,2020-08-20 03:35:22,iczcla,"I know we as Americans love/hate when “all eyes on us”, but holy shit 11/3 all eyes everywhere will truly be on us, in an unprecedented way"
7479,2020-08-20 03:57:47,iczcla,"Now more than ever, I have significant less trust in our ballots getting counted through the mail. I would run through glass and a tornado to get to my local polling station, and I sure as fuck am voting early"
7480,2020-08-20 03:54:51,iczcla,"Yes, I doing exactly the same, and i am telling my family and friends to do the same..."
7481,2020-08-20 03:53:23,iczcla,Hell yeah! Go you!
7482,2020-08-20 03:54:40,iczcla,"o wise one, thank you!"
7483,2020-08-20 04:04:05,iczcla,"He's like a real life Captain Picard to me. Just oozing confidence, class, and the best ideals of the human race. I have problems with his administration too but I can't knock the guy's charisma."
7484,2020-08-20 04:10:21,iczcla,Obama is up there with Lincoln and Churchill as a great orator. Hands down the best I'll ever experience in my lifetime.
7485,2020-08-20 03:59:03,iczcla,Very true. This may well include comparisons to even many other world leaders.
7486,2020-08-20 04:31:39,iczcla,"It's interesting to compare Obama and Bill Clinton's oratorial styles (not policies of course) because both are just tremendous speakers. Clinton had the more down-to-earth, relatable style. He could present nuance in a way that was just so easy to understand. Obama is the more grand, big-picture guy. He's the guy people will be quoting for the next century like they do with FDR and Kennedy. With Clinton, you understood. With Obama, you felt. Both very effective but completely different."
7487,2020-08-20 04:06:55,iczcla,appreciate you
7488,2020-08-20 04:04:44,iczcla,thanks!
7489,2020-08-20 05:06:21,iczcla,And for the RGB’s replacement (she is very healthy but we don’t know how much longer she will last)
7490,2020-08-20 05:07:42,iczcla,Joe can simply stand at the podium and not say a word and he will have my vote. The orange starburst has got to go!
7491,2020-08-20 05:34:11,iczcla,I have seen joe do white well with speeches. Especially recently. I think he will kill it.
7492,2020-08-20 02:11:59,iczcla,I’m actually going from Luke warm to super fan.
7493,2020-08-20 02:13:50,iczcla,He's a pretty amazing man. I'm feeling my VP Biden feels once again.
7494,2020-08-20 02:12:51,iczcla,Oh man why didn’t she emcee last night!
7495,2020-08-20 01:59:20,iczcla,She’s 80?!!?!
7496,2020-08-20 03:20:03,iczcla,And after raising 5 kids
7497,2020-08-20 02:13:15,iczcla,I thought it was Hoda Kotb at first! Hoda is 56.
7498,2020-08-20 05:09:50,iczcla,Slay loved her ba intro
7499,2020-08-20 02:02:29,iczcla,The restraint she showed during the bush years and all the flack she took over it were ultimately vindicated. I admit I was wrong back then to shit talk her approach to GW.
7500,2020-08-20 02:05:12,iczcla,"Watching her career, she plays the long game and takes the high road to accomplish goals through coalition building. People may look to specific individual issues to shun her, but they don't always realize what it takes to get legislation passed in the US sometimes takes temporary sacrifices for long term goals."
7501,2020-08-20 03:26:40,iczcla,"He's like Clinton back in the day. He used to give amazing speeches. Long ones, but great."
7502,2020-08-20 01:25:24,iczcla,It's a big tent party
7503,2020-08-20 01:26:12,iczcla,My husband is a microbiologist PhD. So few of his fellow recent graduates decided against government jobs for industry. Trump admin has made a joke of our institutions.
7504,2020-08-20 01:58:16,iczcla,I should probably call my grandmother and check on her.
7505,2020-08-20 01:57:56,iczcla,I was going to say that except I can't spell anurism.
7506,2020-08-20 02:02:56,iczcla,"four years ago, I didnt like her so I voted third party, and now I wished I had voted for her because I realized I had essentially wasted a vote. The political climate has changed so much in the last four years."
7507,2020-08-20 01:58:53,iczcla,"Look, POTUS is in the WWE Hall of Fame. We need a new politician in that shit."
7508,2020-08-20 01:59:26,iczcla,Bah Gawd
7509,2020-08-20 01:59:43,iczcla,it got me to pop!
7510,2020-08-20 02:01:54,iczcla,She got the triple h intro video
7511,2020-08-20 02:13:51,iczcla,I thought Biden was in a basement?
7512,2020-08-20 02:12:37,iczcla,Also: Women couldn't apply for a credit card in their own name until 1974.
7513,2020-08-20 02:12:54,iczcla,Sexually ~~harassing~~ assaulting people. FTFY
7514,2020-08-20 02:11:57,iczcla,I'm here for it
7515,2020-08-20 02:14:56,iczcla,"I already made a drink, I'm ready."
7516,2020-08-20 02:15:17,iczcla,I hope tonight is the first night to signal the blood letting and the slaughter commences until election day.
7517,2020-08-20 02:20:12,iczcla,Nice catch!
7518,2020-08-20 02:31:40,iczcla,If he didn't already since Hillary
7519,2020-08-20 02:32:25,iczcla,I’m expecting a hard r on Twitter after this.
7520,2020-08-20 02:32:03,iczcla,"as professorial as he is, Obama has always spoken plainly."
7521,2020-08-20 02:32:24,iczcla,I was just thinking that.
7522,2020-08-20 02:34:25,iczcla,But yet somehow that person is still employed and paid more than you.
7523,2020-08-20 02:34:44,iczcla,It’s hard to believe their the same species.
7524,2020-08-20 02:34:24,iczcla,Trump isn't doing the job he was given. That's why it looks so different.
7525,2020-08-20 02:34:11,iczcla,Only won got the popular vote
7526,2020-08-20 02:44:24,iczcla,We are watching a generational speech. This is absolutely breathtaking.
7527,2020-08-20 02:50:35,iczcla,Very similar to how I felt watching his convention speech that rocketed him to the presidency.
7528,2020-08-20 02:52:17,iczcla,"I wish Obama would have said something to the effect of “and for people who have committed crimes against our democracy, they will be charged”."
7529,2020-08-20 02:47:37,iczcla,Lincoln?
7530,2020-08-20 02:47:42,iczcla,"I like Obama, and think he was a good president, but I don't know that I'd say he was best."
7531,2020-08-20 02:48:04,iczcla,Halfway through I realized I was witnessing a historical moment.
7532,2020-08-20 02:46:55,iczcla,It will be referenced in history books for sure.
7533,2020-08-20 02:49:33,iczcla,He gave another strong speech for the ages in Philadelphia after the Rev. Wright controversy.
7534,2020-08-20 02:46:39,iczcla,"We all are, don't deny it."
7535,2020-08-20 02:48:16,iczcla,I cried the night he was elected in 2008 and I’m not ashamed
7536,2020-08-20 02:48:10,iczcla,I'm still hoping for 4. Having W introduce Joe would be fucking awesome.
7537,2020-08-20 02:48:10,iczcla,This is why life long Republicans are voting for Biden.
7538,2020-08-20 02:50:04,iczcla,Yeah but they’ll probably have the MyPillow guy!
7539,2020-08-20 02:50:28,iczcla,"RNC isn't even gonna have any former president candidates speak.

DNC had two more, plus the wife of a third."
7540,2020-08-20 02:47:34,iczcla,it has a pillow CEO though
7541,2020-08-20 02:51:51,iczcla,"To be fair, there's only one alive, although I've heard that Bush isn't planning on voting for, let alone endorsing Trump."
7542,2020-08-20 05:13:43,iczcla,"It brought me to tears then Kamala's speech kept me there. I'm not sure how many other people felt this way, but I think Kamala's speech had the edge for me, but not just because of the speech. I think it is because she is my senator who I voted for and because I am also a woman of color with an immigrant mother. Something really special about seeing another girl from the bay area up on the national stage and talking about fucking make it to a presidential ticket, watching her say she accepts the nomination made me swell with pride. And the intro video, watching those little girls talk about what a hero she is to them, I think about my little niece and the world I want to leave her, and how electing Biden and Harris is one of the biggest gifts we can give to her generation. As Kamala said, we have the chance to change the course of history with this election! I'm so inspired and fired up!"
7543,2020-08-20 02:52:25,iczcla,Oh yes!
7544,2020-08-20 02:53:09,iczcla,You and me both.
7545,2020-08-20 02:52:45,iczcla,Where is that?  My husband would love to watch it!
7546,2020-08-20 02:52:44,iczcla,"Wait, there’s a sign language stream?"
7547,2020-08-20 02:54:37,iczcla,Truly
7548,2020-08-20 02:54:55,iczcla,Take your goddamn upvote
7549,2020-08-20 03:05:49,iczcla,I underestimated her completely after the primary campaign. It's like she really found her place and is comfortable now in this role and she shines now that she's more herself I think. And to be clear that's nothing to do with her appealing to women of color. It's just that she's emerged as a much better politician and leader in this context.
7550,2020-08-20 02:56:43,iczcla,"Mind you, she has a pretty polarizing reaction from WOC. A lot of people I know who are organizers for Black Lives Matter don't particularly like her.

&#x200B;

Just because someone looks like you, doesn't mean they speak for your entire community. It's like people expecting me to like Andrew Yang because he's East Asian, just no."
7551,2020-08-20 02:59:47,iczcla,It's refreshing.
7552,2020-08-20 03:00:06,iczcla,"yeah, this feels a lot nicer!"
7553,2020-08-20 03:00:43,iczcla,"I would have liked to see that Obama speech with a crowd, that one would have been awesome. The rest... Yeah."
7554,2020-08-20 03:01:05,iczcla,It’s certainly moving a lot faster. President Obama’s speech would’ve taken an hour with all of the applause breaks every 30 seconds.
7555,2020-08-20 03:01:58,iczcla,"I do too. And without all the audience interruptions, they can fit in so much more content. I've never watched a convention before but I've been watching straight through for 3 nights now."
7556,2020-08-20 03:01:59,iczcla,"I'm all for Phase I traffic again, honestly."
7557,2020-08-20 03:02:25,iczcla,Agreed.  I dont miss the crowds one bit.
7558,2020-08-20 03:03:53,iczcla,"Actually, I wonder how symbolic it would be to have them set up the convention hall in Wisconsin. Chairs and spots. The State sign placards and the podium. Do all that....and just have Joe Biden speak.

Might not be as powerful as the pope having evening prayers alone but still."
7559,2020-08-20 03:04:07,iczcla,it definitely shows who can focus and speak complete sentences.
7560,2020-08-20 03:01:30,iczcla,Amen.
7561,2020-08-20 03:01:49,iczcla,I miss seeing my kids.
7562,2020-08-20 03:01:50,iczcla,thank you for what you do!
7563,2020-08-20 03:02:34,iczcla,"Adding lots of canvas skills to my resume and digitizing a lot of resources though...

So there is that..."
7564,2020-08-20 03:04:46,iczcla,<3
7565,2020-08-20 03:03:52,iczcla,"Holy shit, I literally don't remember him even after looking it up"
7566,2020-08-20 03:03:00,iczcla,"I did that last week. Poor Tim Kaine, he seems like such a nice guy too."
7567,2020-08-20 03:05:01,iczcla,he was the equivalent of a knitted vest
7568,2020-08-20 03:15:24,iczcla,"IMO, the unspoken reason she didnt win. He was a terrible running mate. You want a VP to follow Biden's VP tenure? To stand against the storm surge of Trump's campaign?

Sure, pick that guy. The one that almost nobody would remember less than one presidential term later."

7607,2020-08-20 03:39:30,iczcla,Trump looks like the orange slugbeast from planet Horticon-5 being mind controlled by a white martian hefflefluster masquerading as a terrible hairpiece. If looks mattered as much for men as they do for women in politics he'd have never won a primary.

7883,2020-08-20 04:04:43,iczcla,Trump is going to the speaker on every night. He is going to give the same rambling speach each night.
7884,2020-08-20 04:05:54,iczcla,"Non-Stop Fear, Pearl-Clutching, and Feeling Victimized."
7885,2020-08-20 03:51:45,iczcla,I was under the impression there wouldn’t be coverage of the rnc. Maybe I was mistaken?

7912,2020-08-20 02:49:32,iczcla,"He was still editing the speech a couple of hours ago, so he was putting in extra effort to make sure he got it as close to perfect as possible.

Compare that to Trump, who only ever sounds articulate when he's reading from a teleprompter or written speech in front of him."
7913,2020-08-20 02:48:46,iczcla,Me too man. Me too.
7914,2020-08-20 02:51:10,iczcla,Trump certainly is

7919,2020-08-20 02:55:31,iczcla,Wish Biden woulda chose him for VP
7920,2020-08-20 02:55:34,iczcla,The funny thing is I'm not sure if he would have kept running
7921,2020-08-20 03:06:15,iczcla,Good point.
7922,2020-08-20 03:09:38,iczcla,Yea I’m digging it too.
7923,2020-08-20 03:08:05,iczcla,Yes — I’m in SF where I just set up an exhaust fan to blow the wildfire smoke out of my apartment. The masks you use against Covid are the opposite of what you need to protect against smoke — so we are pretty much trapped at home now.
7924,2020-08-20 03:13:13,iczcla,This
7925,2020-08-20 03:11:35,iczcla,Haven’t seen one tbh
7926,2020-08-20 03:21:23,iczcla,"IMO, the roll call was vastly improved with this year's format.  I really liked get a glimpse of the location the delegates chose to present their state to a(n inter)national audience"
7927,2020-08-20 03:16:15,iczcla,Totally agree.  I hope they mostly keep this format in 2024.  Maybe audiences for some of the big speeches.
7928,2020-08-20 03:22:36,iczcla,I agree. I like it a lot
7929,2020-08-20 03:17:56,iczcla,Way less dead air even with some of the slight pauses between speakers.
7930,2020-08-20 03:56:57,iczcla,No one triggers him as much as Obama lol
7931,2020-08-20 01:26:34,iczcla,In my state we have voter registration for 16 and 17 year olds! They can't vote yet but they can get involved
7932,2020-08-20 01:32:06,iczcla,My coworkers daughter  was able to register to vote before she turned 18. She turned 18 right before FL primary and was able to vote. They are very pumped. This generation will be our boomers I think.
7933,2020-08-20 01:46:41,iczcla,"It’s a dose of normal. Take it easy bro, you haven’t snorted this in 3.5 years."
7934,2020-08-20 01:46:45,iczcla,It's not just you. I was coming here to say the same! I'm all emotional n shit. Literal tears and goosebumps.
7935,2020-08-20 01:46:20,iczcla,"Nah I'm feeling hype too. Day one was an opening and a call for unity, day 2 was about who Biden is and today's all about what sets Democrats apart."
7936,2020-08-20 01:45:53,iczcla,Me too. Tonight is the best so far.
7937,2020-08-20 01:46:13,iczcla,"Then do it!

You might need more than one line to hit the entire country though"
7938,2020-08-20 01:46:33,iczcla,Haha I’m feeling hopeful for the first time in 6 months
7939,2020-08-20 01:48:49,iczcla,"Best DNC night I’ve ever seen. They are using the new medium well, and the inclusive vision and breadth of the party is inspiring."
7940,2020-08-20 01:45:51,iczcla,Because you're right.
7941,2020-08-20 01:46:09,iczcla,Let's just hope it pays off.  We've never seen as much cheating as Trump and the GOP are doing right now.
7942,2020-08-20 01:47:23,iczcla,They definitely saved the best for last.
7943,2020-08-20 01:02:51,iczcla,Yup
7944,2020-08-20 01:03:26,iczcla,Voting in person on Election Day is a tradition for me.
7945,2020-08-20 01:03:49,iczcla,Yes
7946,2020-08-20 01:03:57,iczcla,I will be.
7947,2020-08-20 01:04:21,iczcla,I am! In a major swing state and I want to 100% make sure my vote is counted
7948,2020-08-20 01:03:45,iczcla,Going to hand deliver mail in ballot
7949,2020-08-20 01:04:01,iczcla,I have. The lines are never bad at my precinct and I don't want to risk my ballot getting fucked with. I'm comfortable going out for long enough to vote.
7950,2020-08-20 01:04:05,iczcla,I'm in a new district this year & thinking that it might be one of those places w/ long lines.  Doesn't seem worth getting COVID potentially since I can do mail in.
7951,2020-08-20 01:04:11,iczcla,"I’m in Arizona where I’ve voted by mail for a decade since I was eighteen, but I will be voting in person for the first time this year!"
7952,2020-08-20 01:04:27,iczcla,I will.
7953,2020-08-20 01:04:36,iczcla,I'm voting early in person.
7954,2020-08-20 01:05:18,iczcla,Yup
7955,2020-08-20 01:06:33,iczcla,"My polling location normally has a hot dog cook out. stupid as it is, it's something I look forward to. I'm doubting they'll do it this year so I'm on the fence. I live in an urban area, but its usually quick and easy to vote. Its also easy to drop off my absentee ballot at the election office....considering working the polls as well..."
7956,2020-08-20 01:23:43,iczcla,"the thought has crossed my mind, but:

* The city election office has slashed the number of polling places that will be open. I really don't want to wait in line all day if I don't have to.
* My state (PA) recently passed an election reform law allowing early/mail in voting for all. I want to know that the system works properly and my mail-in vote is properly recorded.

Ballots are supposed to be mailed out in September and I plan to fill it out and return it right away. But if the website doesn't say it was recorded by, say October 15th I'm going to go to the polls and cast a provisional ballot."

7973,2020-08-20 02:06:44,iczcla,It’s super real. I know some people are saying it’s pandering but seriously it’s nice exposure to see all the issues that we are fighting for!
7974,2020-08-20 02:06:20,iczcla,"It's talking to all the people in this country, and letting them know that their issues are important, and that the people vying for their support want to be there for them. I think it's really poignant letting the people speak to these issues as well, rather than politicians just speaking for them."
7975,2020-08-20 02:09:35,iczcla,yep
7976,2020-08-20 02:06:54,iczcla,And the ADA.

7979,2020-08-20 02:28:52,iczcla,"Privilege is a big part of it. If you never have to think about intimate partner violence, then it's just like any other theoretical issue. You're free to view it idly. If you don't feel the weight of it, you're free to get lost in the less relevant aspects of the discussion. 

I don't disagree, a lot of men dismiss violence against women because they are afraid of examining their own actions. But, a lot of men dismiss it because they aren't afraid."

7987,2020-08-20 02:53:32,iczcla,The level of detail that has clearly gone into this convention has been impressive
7988,2020-08-20 02:54:03,iczcla,"The RNC is going to look like a steaming pile in comparison, just wait"
7989,2020-08-20 02:56:15,iczcla,"They really did.  There were a handful of cheesy moments (some were endearing), and some very minor technical hiccups, but by and large, this was a great convention that has had me more engaged than past ones."
7990,2020-08-20 02:54:39,iczcla,"No kidding. Props to the entire team and everyone involved in putting these clips together. They're great.

I can't wait to see what the GOP comes up with for their convention."
7991,2020-08-20 03:03:12,iczcla,I'll agree with you as long as this speech doesn't end with a collage of tim and eric clapping.
7992,2020-08-20 02:59:01,iczcla,"She had a tough job after Obama, but damn!!"

7997,2020-08-20 03:15:07,iczcla,"I am impressed with the way they are doing this virtual convention too. It is moving, interesting and inspiring. I love the slightly 'corny' bits too."
7998,2020-08-20 03:17:02,iczcla,"Not gonna lie...I prefer a traditional convention...but with the unprecedented challenges this pandemic has put on the political process?  I’m very pleased with this convention.  There have been one or two awkward moments, but nothing more than would have been in a big arena event - and it has gone SO much smoother...no long lulls and waiting periods between speakers...I think they’ll need to take some of the production lessons from this and apply them to future big arena conventions for sure."
7999,2020-08-20 03:17:29,iczcla,"Holy shit, really? She definitely projects powerfully for someone so short."
8000,2020-08-20 03:16:45,iczcla,"That short? I'm surprised, I'll admit to that."

8002,2020-08-20 03:18:51,iczcla,That convention is going to be a shit show. They even got Dr Demon Sperm.

8004,2020-08-20 03:22:13,iczcla,Oh god.  Because the conventions are virtual these clowns can probably bring their guns.  I wouldn’t be surprised to see brandishing weapons as a popular RNC gimmick.
8005,2020-08-20 03:48:06,iczcla,Uhg. They're from my state. Embarrassing.

8038,2020-08-20 02:14:28,iczcla,They need to start strategically pissing off Trump. The more his supporters and the Republicans have to make excuses for him the better. Then stand back and watch the dumpster fire until election day.
8039,2020-08-20 02:18:36,iczcla,They also had to start from scratch about a month ago from a live convention to digital

8048,2020-08-20 02:32:19,iczcla,wonder if they pre-medicated him so he would blow out his blood pressure

8054,2020-08-20 02:44:39,iczcla,I hope so. You’d think watching the absolute chaos unfold during the last 4 years would have been enough
8055,2020-08-20 02:45:01,iczcla,They don't know how to listen.
8056,2020-08-20 02:46:48,iczcla,"No, listening is not part of their toolkit. Listen to what he says about how Civil Rights leaders still fought for democracy despite all the violence and injustice they faced. 

Now you have some kid on Twitter claiming that democracy should die because their loans aren't paid back."
8057,2020-08-20 02:47:58,iczcla,"Yeah, I'm ready to help turn Texas blue. Any of my fellow Texans out there.....holla at me."

She's also a tireless supporter of the Democratic party, and works hard to get them elected up and down the ballot. I'm pretty sure she emptied out her warchest from 2016 for the midterms on helping candidates get elected, even though it meant she started off in a financially rough place for her presidential campaign."
8100,2020-08-20 03:11:38,iczcla,"It would be very, very difficult to follow up Obama, and yet she is doing fantastic."
8101,2020-08-20 03:11:35,iczcla,"Yup, the only one in the world who can compete with Obama is Michelle.  They're just in a league of their own.

Kamala had an awesome speech though."
8102,2020-08-20 03:12:59,iczcla,"I never forget that Obama is that good an orator. I still remember his speech at the 2004 Dem Convention. I was walking thru LR cleaning house when he started speaking. I didn't see him, just heard him. When I heard him, I stopped & turned around to the tv, saying aloud to myself, ""Who is THAT?"" He was electrifying."
8103,2020-08-20 03:51:10,iczcla,"Seriously - whose smart idea was it to put kamala after him? Her speech was great, but how the hell do you follow that speech from Obama? 

Giving credit where it’s due, she came off as warm, genuine, articulate, and passionate. All the chops of a strong VP, and yet came across as a caring aunt. I’ve only ever seen her In hard ass mode, and surprisingly she’s good at being soft as well."
8104,2020-08-20 04:05:20,iczcla,"Obama is a once-in-a-lifetime orator. Don't hold Biden (or anyone else) to that high standard. You don't need to be an amazing orator to be a good President. 

Good news is Obama is young and can continue to be influential for many decades to come. If Biden is elected, I could easily see Obama replacing RBG on the bench. That would not happen if Trump gets re-elected. And you know Obama has way too much dignity to take on a Fox News or even a CNN spot soooo...."

8368,2020-08-20 03:24:34,iczcla,"In all reality our systematic complacency has already allowed that. Wait for Mueller, wait for impeachment, wait for elections. We the people were never vocal enough outside of the interwebs keyboard activism. 
Trump's gotten away with transcending every, single, norm. Breaking every single stop gap from nepotism to pardons. Nothing has been left unturned. And now. To get it all back? It's going to take decades of effort that simply will never gain enough consistent footing to occur.
Just like in the 90s god was dead so is the America the world and we knew. We've jumped the shark."

8372,2020-08-20 03:29:35,iczcla,It was implied. Have to stay civil for now.
8373,2020-08-20 03:38:24,iczcla,I think it was more powerful that she didn't.

Ah yes, let’s invite the folks who pointed their guns at protestors and each other while their fingers were on the triggers to come tell us who “responsible gun owners” support.  If you’re a republican gun owner you’ve got to be honest with yourselves and admit, these two chucklefucks are the *last* two idiots you want representing your values."

8396,2020-08-20 05:30:57,iczcla,"Shooting yourself in the dick is not a fair analogy. 


It's more like murdering your entire family before shooting yourself in the head than it is just a simple dick shooting."

8427,2020-08-20 02:13:36,iczcla,Real Hillary wasn't allowed to be real Hillary. 20 years of propaganda and the 2016 election coverage precisely proved this point

Could you imagine giving 8 tireless years under the immense pressure of leading this country and doing what you can to keep it safe, only to watch your successor rip down  not just what you hoped to achieve, but the foundations of the country you love? It has to be a completely devastating feeling"
8470,2020-08-20 02:44:03,iczcla,I thought he teared up when he talked about John Lewis being arrested on the day he was born
8471,2020-08-20 02:44:31,iczcla,"I mean he's talking about what will either be the end of America or the restoration of America come election day, that's a lot to deal with."

8475,2020-08-20 02:50:48,iczcla,It makes me really nervous what Trump could do in these days. I'm sure Obama taking shot at him needing attention as a reality TV star has problem got to him more than anything the last few years.
8476,2020-08-20 02:49:02,iczcla,he's so fucking weak minded
8477,2020-08-20 02:49:35,iczcla,He can’t handle a president that can speak in coherent fashion and full sentences.
8478,2020-08-20 02:57:50,iczcla,"OK, it's a thing!"

It's unfortunate that the American public is so shallow that pointed fingers make them not want to vote for someone lol"
8487,2020-08-20 03:09:07,iczcla,"IIRC, Bill Clinton invented it. It was a way to be forceful but not aggressive like a fully closed fist. Its popular enough that most politicians use it."

Could have easily taken the low hanging fruit (like all the rest of the speakers did) and just bash Trump. Tell me that I should vote for Biden because Trump did so and so... No, he told me exactly why I should vote for Joe Biden without even really mentioning Trump at all. To me Obama is the greatest assest a campaign could have and they need to have him out front and center.

She would have made an awesome president.  We sure in hell would not be in this mess we are in now.

8795,2020-08-20 06:48:17,iczcla,"A few other takeaways since I can't Tweet anymore (I told a friend I was going to bed):

* Is anyone extra nervous for Biden's speech tomorrow? President Obama really set the bar *this fucking high* for what it means to be Presidential. Joe better bring his A game tomorrow!
* President Obama called out ""Donald Trump"" merely by name (twice) and never referred to him by his title as President Trump. The shade is **DENSE**!
* Can we all just take a moment to just appreciate this genius line:

&#x200B;

>*He’s shown no interest in putting in the work; no interest in finding common ground; no interest in using the awesome power of his office to help anyone but himself and his friends; no interest in treating the presidency as anything but one more reality show that he can use to get the attention he craves""*

&#x200B;

Edit: I've been seeing a lot of Tweets & Facebook posts from Republicans saying they'll tune into Biden's speech tomorrow either jokingly or out of ""morbid curiosity"" - with all this talk of ""cognitive decline"" from the right, tomorrow is quite certainly the most important speech of his entire life & his biggest chance to prove to America what he's got."

She came off as genuine which can't be fake.  HIllary has always had a charisma problem and it showed in her campaigns and even tonight in her segment."

9174,2020-08-20 01:21:36,iczcla,"Yup.  He's allowed our water supply and air to be poisoned, endangered animals to be slaughtered, birds to be killed, national parks to be pillaged.  It's disgusting."
9175,2020-08-20 01:23:31,iczcla,And he shouted out his union!
9176,2020-08-20 01:28:48,iczcla,"not watching.  which part?  (i'll watch later)

Thanks"
9177,2020-08-20 01:35:15,iczcla,Is that that new ICE documentary? I've been meaning to watch that
9178,2020-08-20 01:37:58,iczcla,In a good way
9179,2020-08-20 01:41:18,iczcla,I love it!
9180,2020-08-20 01:41:32,iczcla,His name is prince Royce
9181,2020-08-20 01:42:34,iczcla,Prince Royce

9184,2020-08-20 01:44:36,iczcla,Well she did beat their orange emperor
9185,2020-08-20 01:45:03,iczcla,"And they still can't name a single thing she's done that's illegal.  Everything they've accused her of, Trump has actually done."
9186,2020-08-20 01:48:33,iczcla,They just sedated him.
9187,2020-08-20 01:48:37,iczcla,crying like a baby over here
9188,2020-08-20 01:58:59,iczcla,And also insult Biden's cognitive functions. At least I can understand Joe.
9189,2020-08-20 01:57:11,iczcla,RIP Bobby

9192,2020-08-20 01:57:07,iczcla,Part of the MAGA dream.
9193,2020-08-20 02:16:49,iczcla,"Trump, probably: ""I respect women who don't make their husbands beat them."""
9194,2020-08-20 02:17:02,iczcla,"Republicans have successfully marketed their party as best for the economy. That's bullshit. 

If it was up to me, they would be showing charts about how much better the economy runs under Democrats. Thank God I'm not in charge."
9195,2020-08-20 02:19:02,iczcla,Also what everyone under the rainbow cares about
9196,2020-08-20 02:18:54,iczcla,Farmers are mostly millionaires. *plays tiniest violin*
9197,2020-08-20 02:19:04,iczcla,Treasury maybe?
9198,2020-08-20 02:24:53,iczcla,"Nothing out of the ordinary if you think about it, she's pretty much a rookie. Sanders and Warren have been around for a lot longer with good reason."
9199,2020-08-20 02:24:21,iczcla,They’re popular. AOC is mostly disliked nationally.
9200,2020-08-20 02:24:25,iczcla,The big tent hasn't abandoned progressives
9201,2020-08-20 02:24:41,iczcla,Best of the list for last.

9204,2020-08-20 02:28:22,iczcla,So say we all.
9205,2020-08-20 02:43:07,iczcla,"Oh my, you’re right"
9206,2020-08-20 02:34:36,iczcla,So I wasn’t wrong a moment ago when I said that there is nothing more that he hates than Obama.
9207,2020-08-20 02:34:55,iczcla,lol ikr
9208,2020-08-20 02:35:34,iczcla,Lol you aren't kidding
9209,2020-08-20 02:42:26,iczcla,I wonder how much longer it will be before he publicly breaks out the N word
9210,2020-08-20 02:49:28,iczcla,"He already has.

Look up his books, Dreams of my Father, etc"
9211,2020-08-20 02:38:02,iczcla,That Obamagate video he has pinned is stupid as shit. I hope Twitter takes it down.
9212,2020-08-20 02:37:53,iczcla,it's fine- Trump will be in jail so they won't have to have that guy hanging around.
9213,2020-08-20 02:38:46,iczcla,like Trump is going to be invited
9214,2020-08-20 02:38:23,iczcla,Like Trump will be invited. Haha
9215,2020-08-20 02:38:36,iczcla,He's not even going to be there.
9216,2020-08-20 02:38:19,iczcla,He is.  He just screamed in all caps that Obama spied on him and got caught.
9217,2020-08-20 02:42:39,iczcla,Damn straight.  Make a plan and take a reluctant voter.
9218,2020-08-20 02:43:22,iczcla,Those were my exact thoughts when I heard that he had passed
9219,2020-08-20 02:48:16,iczcla,"Pffft what would give you that impression?

9220,2020-08-20 02:51:39,iczcla,"I felt that comment you just deleted. I felt that, bro. 

Good luck. Hope it happens for you soon."

9226,2020-08-20 02:50:52,iczcla,President Plankton.
9227,2020-08-20 02:52:41,iczcla,They knew what they signed up for.
9228,2020-08-20 03:02:03,iczcla,"A really good example would be people from the financial sector who are the most notorious tax evaders in the world.  You know, like the credit card industry.

Whose career was built by credit card lobbyists again?"
9229,2020-08-20 03:09:44,iczcla,And we just point to their confederate flag
9230,2020-08-20 03:16:48,iczcla,Oh god dammit Trump is going to rage about inauguration crowd sizes being smaller for Biden isn’t he?
9231,2020-08-20 03:26:40,iczcla,I protested at Trumps. I would love to go watch these two get inaugurated. Just to get the bad taste of the last inauguration out of my mouth.

9235,2020-08-20 03:16:36,iczcla,"Look it up, her speech was incredibly moving."
9236,2020-08-20 03:16:31,iczcla,She was handpicked by Aretha to play her in the upcoming biopic. Love Jennifer Hudson.
9237,2020-08-20 03:17:44,iczcla,Jennifer Hudson
9238,2020-08-20 03:26:35,iczcla,"She was an American Idol contestant who made it to the top 7, and her big break was the film adaptation of the musical ""Dreamgirls"" (where she played a member of a Supremes-like girl group in the 1960s). I think she also sang the national anthem at the Superbowl one time."
9239,2020-08-20 03:31:14,iczcla,"Polls open at 7AM EST 75 days, 8 hours, 28 minutes from now...

Edit: I realize early voting starts before election day, but the comment said 72 days, so I'm assuming OP thought election day was November 1, not November 3. Also, given the current state of the USPS and Trump's efforts to disrupt the mail, make sure your mail-in-ballot is returned at least 14 days BEFORE the election. I live in Georgia and we've already had to deal with 1 stolen election since Trump got into office. My household will be requesting mail-in-ballots."
9240,2020-08-20 03:34:48,iczcla,I’m scared to death
9241,2020-08-20 03:38:21,iczcla,Can’t wait for him to speak tomorrow!

9250,2020-08-20 02:06:29,iczcla,Dun dun
9251,2020-08-20 02:14:08,iczcla,That’s way to intense. I get high and watch Trailer Park Boys. Try it out.
9252,2020-08-20 02:53:15,iczcla,"He fell short of our desires, but was better than our fears. Slow progress is still progress.

Edit. And by that I mean I am generally a fan. Think he could have done better on Healthcare, less militaristic, and stuck it to corporations more. But overall decent.  And certainly good for America."
9253,2020-08-20 03:00:24,iczcla,"Always thought he was a man of character and compassion. His comportment as President was perfect. Only issue was we want more progressive policies. Of course, Bernie put it in perspective in his speech--Democracy is in an existential crisis. We can have a good fight about policy once Democracy is working again."
9254,2020-08-20 02:59:55,iczcla,"I do, he deserves criticism. But he was better than either of the alternatives. Just like Biden is better than the alternative. We will continue the fight in primaries. Primaries are the time for fighting. The general is the time for pragmatism."
9255,2020-08-20 02:55:04,iczcla,"Statesman of the highest order. I was disappointed in how little he accomplished, but cut him a ton of slack now after the fact where it's clear that the Republican Congress willingly stonewalled him even though they knew their actions would directly harm the country"
9256,2020-08-20 02:54:01,iczcla,"Yes, first President I voted for when I was 22 in ‘08"
9257,2020-08-20 02:58:17,iczcla,"I have my problems with Obama, but I never doubted him to do the right thing for all of America.  I wish he went further on Healthcare and the environment, but I'd take Obama without even thinking about it over even one more second of Trump."
9258,2020-08-20 02:56:21,iczcla,Obama is presidential and well spoken he did things i agreed with but failed in many others. He had a chance to be great but was to cautious to actually implement the hope and change he promised.
9259,2020-08-20 02:59:28,iczcla,"I mean I do not outwardly despise him or anything like that, but he does not inspire me the way it might someone half a generation older."
9260,2020-08-20 03:10:27,iczcla,I was thinking the same... don't they have the power of Hollywood behind them? This whole production should have been Lawrence of Arabia quality!  Stop showing people standing awkwardly across an empty room too. (not Kamala)
9261,2020-08-20 03:07:09,iczcla,"Agreed - just stay on her, damnit. Like slow down."

9265,2020-08-20 03:07:57,iczcla,or maybe just asked to stop with the bad shots
9266,2020-08-20 03:41:38,iczcla,It's the Chicago Cultural Center. Not a theater. And it is fucking beautiful.
9267,2020-08-20 03:18:46,iczcla,This is such an amazing performance. Like I knew she was a great singer but goddamn this is something else.

9269,2020-08-20 04:49:54,iczcla,"That was my initial reaction too. I was disappointed that she didn’t prosecute the scumbag in chief. 
But now I realize her speech was making the case for herself, not the case against him. 
Plenty of others have done that during the DNC and I’m sure she will do so going forward. 
Tonight was rightly about her and her history and future. 
Biden/ Harris 2020!"

9271,2020-08-20 01:58:18,iczcla,No one cares who you want to fuck. Let's not sexualize politicians for happening to be women.
9272,2020-08-20 02:52:50,iczcla,Trump wouldn't have even tried to run if Obama had been allowed a third term.
9273,2020-08-20 02:53:07,iczcla,obviously. also sexy state bro
9274,2020-08-20 02:54:51,iczcla,"I don't think Trump would have even run. He made noises about running against plane in 2012 and even was in some primary polls, but he ultimately decided not to try it against Obama"
9275,2020-08-20 02:56:17,iczcla,"If presidents were allowed to serve more than two terms, Bill Clinton would still be president."
9276,2020-08-20 02:53:36,iczcla,He is scared. We’re in endgame territory and things don’t look too good for him on the other side if Biden doesn’t win. We should all be terrified.
9277,2020-08-20 02:55:32,iczcla,He knew first hand how in bed with russia trump was.
9278,2020-08-20 03:04:37,iczcla,"In general, or when they say LAtin-ex instead of is laTEENex?"
9279,2020-08-20 03:03:12,iczcla,"I don't even know how to properly pronounce that, so I just say Latino lol"
9280,2020-08-20 03:04:11,iczcla,I always learned in Spanish class that -o ending is EITHER masculine OR neutral
9281,2020-08-20 03:13:19,iczcla,As the son of 1st generation Mexican immigrants i have never heard anyone say this in person. From what i can tell this Latinx thing is more of an internet sensation.
9282,2020-08-20 03:04:48,iczcla,SAME (married to a Latino man and understand why that makes no sense in the Spanish language).
9283,2020-08-20 03:03:27,iczcla,"i say Latinx when I speak/write English. Pero, digo Latinos cuando hablo en espanol."
9284,2020-08-20 03:03:09,iczcla,Why?
9285,2020-08-20 03:04:57,iczcla,She’s got those sparkly eyes.
9286,2020-08-20 03:05:16,iczcla,she stepped her game up too
9287,2020-08-20 03:11:32,iczcla,"Kamala hasn’t had right wing media crucify her for every vocal inflection for 30 years. A lot of Hillary’s flatness and robotic characteristics came as a reaction to the media saying she was shrill, too emotional, whatever."
9288,2020-08-20 03:11:41,iczcla,I think Hillary is at her best when she's left to her work. A shame the presidency relies so much on outward appearance
9289,2020-08-20 03:10:56,iczcla,She's got a way of glowing when she smiles that's incredibly heartening.
9290,2020-08-20 03:20:11,iczcla,"Agreed. Like someone else said, it sucks that appearance can be such a determining factor, but that's the sad truth. I never liked Romney, back when he was running, because his smile seemed phony as fuck. It was only later that I saw his policy and stances, and had valid reasons not to like him."
9291,2020-08-20 03:17:24,iczcla,I thought her smile was fake
9292,2020-08-20 03:14:13,iczcla,They'll manufacture ammo regardless.
9293,2020-08-20 03:16:18,iczcla,I have no doubt they'll make something up. Reality is not a prerequisite for them.
9294,2020-08-20 03:14:10,iczcla,"Oh, they’ll try. There were parts of her speech that I’m sure they’ll cut up and misrepresent."
9295,2020-08-20 03:15:29,iczcla,"I think it was good though.  Obama got to say his piece, but he wasn't the final conclusion of the night and overshadow everything else.  It's great that they got the whole group, but the campaign is about JOe and Kamala"
9296,2020-08-20 13:39:22,iczcla,"Biden isn’t that bad. I don’t fucking get why everything has to be qualified with “even if you don’t like him..” like sure Bernie didn’t win the nomination, but Biden has adopted a lot of his policies and Bernie clearly likes a Biden administration a lot more than a Clinton admin. It’s not even in the same ball park."
9297,2020-08-20 14:35:44,iczcla,That's the thing. He won't win. He just may not lose. He may find a way to avoid losing and that is something with which we have very few to the combat. Aside from Nationwide mass rioting the day after.
9298,2020-08-20 23:41:08,iczcla,"The convention missed this strain of fear mongering - good add - I was starting to think that the  world will end as we know it from the speech's but that seals it. 

Gonna write in Bernie."
9299,2020-08-20 01:52:56,iczcla,LMAO. Love this.
9300,2020-08-20 00:37:21,iczcla,Can't wait.
9301,2020-08-20 00:27:48,iczcla,The tweet storm circa 4am tomorrow is gonna be especially insane.
9302,2020-08-20 01:23:59,iczcla,"I don't usually watch the convention's themselves but I did watch Jill Biden's and Michele Obama's speeches.

Whether someone agrees or not with their political views... they came across as genuine. They expressed concern, empathy, and compassion. They spoke of raising a family and guiding their children.

So much of what we're missing in our government today."
9303,2020-08-20 01:38:40,iczcla,He expected some modicum of decency from the president of the United States. Some of us knew what kind of person Trump is. Some had to learn the hard way.
9304,2020-08-20 01:39:16,iczcla,A lot of military votes republican because of foreign policy. Republicans use to be hawks. But now they abandon our allies like the kurds. But yeah at least this person hopefully really did learn what Trump is.
9305,2020-08-20 01:40:48,iczcla,I hope it's the McDonald's wrapper as he chokes on a quarter pounder
9306,2020-08-20 01:41:02,iczcla,Sadly it probably will be a sudden death or in his sleep. No slow agonizing time for regret.
9307,2020-08-20 01:41:21,iczcla,You say that as though he’ll care. Narcissists look at the world differently.
9308,2020-08-20 01:42:23,iczcla,Even then he probably won't notice the apathy in his family's eyes. He'll just be thinking about how his daughter is hotter than McCain's.
9309,2020-08-20 01:45:13,iczcla,Hopefully there's no money left to their name by the time he keels over in six months.  Donnie may die as alone as he deserves to be
9310,2020-08-20 01:45:18,iczcla,He won't die in bed... I'm betting he dies on the toilet
9311,2020-08-20 01:40:49,iczcla,Heck yeah I’m here for the musical numbers
9312,2020-08-20 01:59:18,iczcla,There are certainly pieces of her politics I hate but I agree that she does the job of speaker quite well.
9313,2020-08-20 02:17:55,iczcla,Yes. And most of the q followers I see are in their 50s. It's so crazy
9314,2020-08-20 02:18:04,iczcla,Yes. And most of the q followers I see are in their 50s. It's so crazy
9315,2020-08-20 02:23:17,iczcla,"It was in his press briefing at 5pm EST ....

Someone asked about how he felt about QAnon and of course the narcissistic twat said they like him so can't be that bad etc etc"

9317,2020-08-20 02:33:57,iczcla,Not as pres. but it would be something to see him as a Supreme Court Justice.
9318,2020-08-20 02:35:55,iczcla,"I'll take another 2 terms of him, kay thanks"
9319,2020-08-20 02:36:58,iczcla,We’re not fascists or authoritarians.
9320,2020-08-20 02:33:25,iczcla,plz
9321,2020-08-20 02:35:52,iczcla,Won't be alive. No chance.
9322,2020-08-20 02:36:06,iczcla,Get the fuck out of here. That's a horrible thought.
9323,2020-08-20 02:35:44,iczcla,Stop
9324,2020-08-20 02:36:12,iczcla,"Eh.. he could, if he's not in jail. Which considering the mass of things out there, is unlikely."
9325,2020-08-20 02:36:36,iczcla,"I have a feeling when trump leaves, the cowardly never trumpers will come out and distance themselves hard."
9326,2020-08-20 02:36:36,iczcla,He's old. And fat.
9327,2020-08-20 02:36:51,iczcla,"He'd be 78. With his diet, think he'd still be alive?"
9328,2020-08-20 02:39:48,iczcla,"I don't worry about it at all. Even if his health holds up, public opinion of him is not going to age well."
9329,2020-08-20 02:36:14,iczcla,If he loses he either goes to prison or eats himself to death.
9330,2020-08-20 02:36:35,iczcla,From NY State Prison?
9331,2020-08-20 02:36:43,iczcla,And he honestly seems deranged enough to do it
9332,2020-08-20 02:36:49,iczcla,He’s going to have a lot of spare time to plan for that from prison
9333,2020-08-20 02:37:29,iczcla,He'll be 79
9334,2020-08-20 02:37:30,iczcla,"This is a crazy world, so i wouldnt even rule it out.
Heck, who knows, Alex Jones might run in 2024."
9335,2020-08-20 02:38:15,iczcla,Why would you do that to me
9336,2020-08-20 02:39:41,iczcla,"I've thought about this too, but I doubt he would. I'm honestly praying he strokes out or his heart just gives up in the next few months. At this point, I'd rather have Pence as president, and that's coming from a gay man."
9337,2020-08-20 02:36:56,iczcla,He'll either be dead or in prison by then.
9338,2020-08-20 02:37:26,iczcla,Can't be president from a jail cell
9339,2020-08-20 02:37:38,iczcla,"If Trump loses, he'll be in jail, in Russia or dead by 2024"
9340,2020-08-20 02:41:46,iczcla,Too much pride. No way in hell.
9341,2020-08-20 02:42:57,iczcla,"A diss track.  


Jesus Christ."
9342,2020-08-20 03:19:36,iczcla,"My memory of Kaine is him coming off as a major asshole in the debate against Pence and Pence seemed super dignified in it... and I absolutely hated that because deep down I knew which one was the real asshole, but so many people are influenced by that book cover stuff rather than the substance and I think it had an impact."
9343,2020-08-20 03:58:41,iczcla,What happened? Watched it on YouTube
9344,2020-08-20 03:59:47,iczcla,I dont have cable. Waiting for it to come up on YouTube
9345,2020-08-20 00:29:27,iczcla,"Ooh I didn't know she was speaking!

I know it's pointless to wonder what if but I think she would have been in the senate seat that her husband is running for and maybe even running for president."
9346,2020-08-20 01:07:02,iczcla,Thoughts and Prayers are meaningless without legislative action. I say ban 'em
9347,2020-08-20 01:07:39,iczcla,I'm already there
9348,2020-08-20 01:10:51,iczcla,Between this and the Stanley Cup playoffs I'm gonna end up trashed tonight
9349,2020-08-20 01:16:32,iczcla,I am so glad that the party learned from gore and are leaning in to the presidents of the past
9350,2020-08-20 01:18:57,iczcla,Donald Trump is caring. He shows great concern over his image and cares about how much money he can get.
9351,2020-08-20 01:21:37,iczcla,They stay on it the whole time
9352,2020-08-20 01:20:21,iczcla,Her blonde streak took over
9353,2020-08-20 01:20:15,iczcla,"Probably right before Kamala, who is the last speaker tonight"
9354,2020-08-20 01:20:00,iczcla,Not till at least 10 pm EST
9355,2020-08-20 01:20:46,iczcla,"He'll be last most likely, so maybe 10 or 10:30"
9356,2020-08-20 01:20:28,iczcla,In 1 hour 25 minutes. 955pm cst
9357,2020-08-20 01:23:24,iczcla,Build back better with basically the Green New Deal!
9358,2020-08-20 01:25:51,iczcla,"And by many issues, you mean every issue."

9363,2020-08-20 01:47:53,iczcla,He’s just watching thinking “Would grab. Would grab. Wouldn’t grab. Wouldn’t. Wouldn’t. Would.”
9364,2020-08-20 01:54:05,iczcla,That's an image I could have gone my whole life without.
9365,2020-08-20 02:00:40,iczcla,"Nah, there going to go the racist route and invoke Oakland."
9366,2020-08-20 02:01:48,iczcla,It doesn't work cause it's really hard to make a non-Ivy league educated prosecutor as a typical liberal
9367,2020-08-20 02:09:42,iczcla,"She was from Oakland and served as AG of the state of CA, so there's that. She was a prosecutor, hardly an office that pursues liberal policies.  Plus....Nixon & Reagan. I'm sure they'll bring it up, though. Maybe they're saving it."
9368,2020-08-20 02:17:09,iczcla,"No pressure, because everyone's situation is different, but if there's anything you can do to support a local domestic abuse shelter, it's might make you feel a little better (at least in my experience). Even if you can't donate money, there's often other ways to help."
9369,2020-08-20 02:14:12,iczcla,"They'll talk about the ""China virus"", instead."

9373,2020-08-20 02:22:29,iczcla,Exactly how it should be.

9376,2020-08-20 02:25:55,iczcla,From Trump. Pretty sure he'll give Putin one if he wins the election.
9377,2020-08-20 02:26:11,iczcla,If only presidents could rescind undeserving awards.
9378,2020-08-20 02:25:37,iczcla,Vomit.

9393,2020-08-20 02:47:24,iczcla,"It’s just so surreal that a reality tv show b list celebrity that no one really thought about in years somehow came and stole the presidency from one of the most competent nominees in decades . 

A sleazy tv show host with decades of known and corroborated losses, bankruptcies, disgusting behavior , blatant hate, somehow became the direct rival and “equal” to one of the best American and historic presidents of the modern time, Obama

It’s insane to go on google and if you look up obama the relevant google searches are Trump, Michelle Obama, Ivanka Trump, Melania , and Barr (again), Clinton, Biden, Kanye, Kardashian, etc

Like how the fuck did we get to this timeline ? You told someone all of this 10 years ago they would never have believed you 

What’s crazier is that they both have the same amount of letters in their names :

Barack (6) Donald (6)

Obama (5) Trump (5)

It’s like this timeline was destined to be for some reason"
9394,2020-08-20 02:37:30,iczcla,Too much of a narcissist
9395,2020-08-20 02:38:46,iczcla,Trump feels like a failure all the time.  His father built him that way.  Trump is a failure because he is incompetent.  Trump feels a failure because he is and he can't be anything more after 70 years of trying.

9403,2020-08-20 02:46:07,iczcla,"He said a coronavirus death number that's very accurate, so I think yes"
9404,2020-08-20 02:47:06,iczcla,He was working on his speech up to showtime so probably yes.
9405,2020-08-20 02:47:30,iczcla,That was the plan but Obama wanted Kamala to close
9406,2020-08-20 02:50:58,iczcla,Makes you miss having an orator in the office.
9407,2020-08-20 02:52:15,iczcla,same bro lol
9408,2020-08-20 02:53:22,iczcla,She did make a postcard joke.
9409,2020-08-20 02:59:21,iczcla,I can hear the screech from here followed by a crowd of pink and green.
9410,2020-08-20 03:07:49,iczcla,I see Kamala's wearing her pearls tonight.

9412,2020-08-20 03:13:26,iczcla,Shark week was last week... You're a week behind Discovery programming!  Sorry to take a bite out of your comment! LOL
9413,2020-08-20 03:13:19,iczcla,"We don’t need to compare.  Kamala did great, but Obama is a top 5 orator of all time."
9414,2020-08-20 03:17:07,iczcla,And the chick. They are so into it. I love it.

9417,2020-08-20 03:21:59,iczcla,Oh multiple times. He came unglued on Twitter
9418,2020-08-20 03:21:54,iczcla,"Yes, and the replies are incredible."
9419,2020-08-20 03:21:36,iczcla,Yes lol he’s fuming

9429,2020-08-20 14:44:28,iczcla,"Interesting tidbit: I studied Japanese in university, and then worked in Japan for several years after. During my senior year, my Japanese professor, a Japanese woman, told us that Japan was making English textbooks based on (then-candidate) Obama's speeches, because his speaking was so clear and dynamic. 

I didn't quite believe her, but confirmed it a year later when I moved to Japan. 

I miss having a president that can speak in sentences. :("
9430,2020-08-20 14:00:15,iczcla,"He will because his speeches are also good reading.  They have a tempo and style that reads well.  You can watch them AND read them to get the drive of the speech.

Trump... not so much"
9431,2020-08-20 18:50:00,iczcla,"> Obama will probably go down in history as one of the greatest orators of our time.

Disagree. Without looking at the contents and the messages, Reagan delivered speeches much better."
9432,2020-08-20 15:37:14,iczcla,Obama is a Law Professor.
9433,2020-08-20 20:53:29,iczcla,"I was on conference call with a client from Texas today. They thought they had muted themselves but they had not. The three men in the room were talking about how eloquent Obama was, and what a dignified man he is. The words ""Say what you want about Obama, but he inspires people, and gives them comfort."" were said among many other words of genuine praise. I was shocked. I was shocked because this guy's office has a giant Trump flag in it, his car has a trump bumper sticker, he has a picture of Trump behind his desk next to his kids, and has a big bronze cast GOP elephant on his desk.

We need more of the Obamas."

9443,2020-08-20 02:57:54,iczcla,I hate Trump. I beleive Trump is capable of madness and that he has absolutely no moral compass. Trump is not Hitler. Hitler systematically killed tens of millions of people. Trump has done some abhorrent things. Trump encourages ethnic genocides (Uighurs). But Trump is not on the same level of awful as Hitler.
9444,2020-08-20 02:55:05,iczcla,Right?

9460,2020-08-20 03:15:09,iczcla,"I'm sure they are both tested routinely, it's more about how it looks.  Democrats want to portray that they are taking this seriously."

9463,2020-08-20 03:15:41,iczcla,I prefer that they social distance from one another. It further proves that they are taking the pandemic seriously... which is also a slap in the face to the current admin who doesn't even realize there is a pandemic.
9464,2020-08-20 03:18:29,iczcla,"No, they need to lead by example. People would say ""if they can hug why can't we"" and it would be an elitist thing we don't need right now. It reminds us these are serious times and we need to be safe."

Women like Hillary threaten some women and men.  Biden does not.  Misogyny was the difference.  Kamala doesn't scare like Hillary.  The two women project power differently."

9481,2020-08-20 02:58:54,iczcla,The line about knowing a predator when she sees one was pretty close
9482,2020-08-20 02:59:35,iczcla,Yes! That'd make her look super smart & super classy!
9483,2020-08-20 01:13:44,iczcla,An amazing 5 mins of television
9484,2020-08-20 01:15:38,iczcla,We both are friend :')
9485,2020-08-20 01:18:59,iczcla,"His son had just died, unfortunately. :("
9486,2020-08-20 02:00:05,iczcla,"This part is live I believe, so I think it was more she missed her cue or the person giving her the cue went early."
9487,2020-08-20 02:03:33,iczcla,That escalated quickly...
9488,2020-08-20 02:39:59,iczcla,Yeah like I finally feel the bigness of this moment
9489,2020-08-20 02:42:11,iczcla,No better time than now
9490,2020-08-20 02:44:22,iczcla,Can you imagine an Obama-Trump campaign? A debate? Total annihilation.
9491,2020-08-20 02:57:18,iczcla,"Oh yeah, that was Barry O'Bama. Honest mistake - I think we can definitely rally behind this new guy."
9492,2020-08-20 03:40:32,iczcla,"Then we go Regina George and say, so you agree you are at fault."
9493,2020-08-20 01:07:46,iczcla,same same
9494,2020-08-20 01:06:50,iczcla,And the feelin's right
9495,2020-08-20 01:07:36,iczcla,One of my favorite things at her rallies was the coloring pages they had ready for kids. My son got to color a picture of Bailey before the speech
9496,2020-08-20 01:11:46,iczcla,Bailey appeared in [Colbert's interview with Warren](https://youtu.be/DUKaPGCor6w?t=90) last night.
9497,2020-08-20 01:08:30,iczcla,You'd die 15 minutes in
9498,2020-08-20 03:03:45,iczcla,"Personal opinion as a liberal gun owner, it would help massively to back away from any suggestion of taking any kind of guns away wholesale."
9499,2020-08-20 01:12:19,iczcla,My head might explode.
9500,2020-08-20 01:12:47,iczcla,And do multiple takes.
9501,2020-08-20 01:18:19,iczcla,It's a Big F'n Deal!
9502,2020-08-20 01:32:12,iczcla,Way too diverse for the RNC.
9503,2020-08-20 01:32:51,iczcla,I'm pretty sure there's just going to be a choir made up of all the people who have been dragged out of grocery stores and costco kicking and screaming for not wearing a mask.
9504,2020-08-20 01:32:01,iczcla,Haha that would be great
9505,2020-08-20 01:33:03,iczcla,"^jesus, ^jesus, ^jesus"
9506,2020-08-20 01:33:05,iczcla,Ben Shapiro isn't going to like that. But the remix of him saying Kanye's lyrics will be worth it.
9507,2020-08-20 01:34:25,iczcla,"This would be hilarious. Even better to show how out of touch the RNC is, have Chris Brown open up the event and introduce Kanye."
9508,2020-08-20 01:49:35,iczcla,"He is technically a presidential candidate in opposition to the republican ticket. 

There's probably some campaign law he'd be violating in doing so... maybe?"
9509,2020-08-20 01:38:57,iczcla,Yeah Ivanka should be in a womens prison. Jr amd Eric should be in seperate cell blocks and Trump should be at a super max.
9510,2020-08-20 01:40:16,iczcla,"Honestly, would they care? I think Baron and Melania are close but I don't think anyone else is close with anyone else. They're all too selfish"
9511,2020-08-20 01:44:42,iczcla,i don’t think that would make much of a difference for that family. Just ask Tiffany..
9512,2020-08-20 01:44:22,iczcla,I have no idea but I'm really curious
9513,2020-08-20 01:45:11,iczcla,No it will be more similar to the two minute hates from 1984
9514,2020-08-20 01:45:32,iczcla,"Taxes and the economy. ANTIFA and crime. Police and coronavirus. The usual, Fear and Blame."
9515,2020-08-20 01:45:49,iczcla,"I'm sure they will talk about how much they are winning.  All lies of course. The virus is going well, the economy is going well. So on and so forth"
9516,2020-08-20 01:46:46,iczcla,Fear. 100%
9517,2020-08-20 01:47:33,iczcla,It’s going to be fascist family Von Trump with Scott Baio doing a middle finger puppet show.
9518,2020-08-20 01:47:45,iczcla,"Coming from a mostly Republican family of political junkies that attended RNC events and conventions for years, the RNC convention probably will focus on business, liberty, patriotism, the military, gun rights, healthcare, God and the all-important mission of protecting the US from those seeking to destroy it."
9519,2020-08-20 01:52:39,iczcla,100% culture war.
9520,2020-08-20 01:45:35,iczcla,"Sweden, Prussia (throwback to Prussia amirite?), Hungary, and France."
9521,2020-08-20 01:46:27,iczcla,Germany and Scotland sometime in the 1800’s
9522,2020-08-20 01:47:24,iczcla,Italy and Poland around the 1910s/1920s!
9523,2020-08-20 01:46:47,iczcla,She should read an executive order by Trump and then rip it up tonight and set it on fire.
9524,2020-08-20 01:46:40,iczcla,"Lol, I could see Romney doing it, he's been pulling away from the Trump wing for months and he is pretty secure in his seat."
9525,2020-08-20 01:46:25,iczcla,Go the dnc steam on YouTube already
9526,2020-08-20 01:47:24,iczcla,Yeah it keeps covering up the actual text on screen
9527,2020-08-20 01:46:25,iczcla,Yes! Takes up like half the screen. It blocked that nice plate of fried fish last night.
9528,2020-08-20 01:47:48,iczcla,Trump can't handle talking to women he isn't paying. Only way he holds power over them still.
9529,2020-08-20 01:48:00,iczcla,Shirley was the best
9530,2020-08-20 01:47:39,iczcla,Oprah
9531,2020-08-20 01:47:57,iczcla,oprah’s narrating
9532,2020-08-20 01:48:13,iczcla,Pretty sure it’s Oprah...
9533,2020-08-20 01:49:44,iczcla,"lol lmk if u figure it out, was just saying the same thing."
9534,2020-08-20 01:55:23,iczcla,So did more people who voted for her.
9535,2020-08-20 01:56:12,iczcla,She did.
9536,2020-08-20 02:03:12,iczcla,I wish she was holding the actual [ceremonial Mace of the House of Representatives](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mace_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives) during her segment like a pimping cane.
9537,2020-08-20 02:02:06,iczcla,"Like, flava flave style on a chain around her neck."
9538,2020-08-20 02:11:27,iczcla,"yep, I hope so too.. At this point, I am actually doing more that hope, I am actually volunteering for Joe Biden Campaign.. we need all hands on deck"
9539,2020-08-20 02:11:52,iczcla,Should’ve ended his whole career right then.
9540,2020-08-20 02:15:07,iczcla,"The convention is hitting actual issues that Americans care about in a way that is relatable, and Fox can't have their viewers exposed to something as pesky as the ""truth""."
9541,2020-08-20 02:18:48,iczcla,"It'll be first next year, if we get out and make them lose in NOV"
9542,2020-08-20 02:19:09,iczcla,"Nah, it’s better to go first. It’s going on the offensive."
9543,2020-08-20 02:19:20,iczcla,"They can try, but cutting and splicing reels of tape together takes much longer than a digital production like this."
9544,2020-08-20 02:20:02,iczcla,They don’t have the time to get it together at this point.
9545,2020-08-20 02:19:03,iczcla,Same.
9546,2020-08-20 02:20:22,iczcla,Jill Biden can do that. I want Warren to be Secretary of Treasury.
9547,2020-08-20 02:20:20,iczcla,"> devil betsy Devos

The Devil her. I resent your making that association."
9548,2020-08-20 02:21:43,iczcla,At least for HUD Secretary.
9549,2020-08-20 02:22:29,iczcla,She would kill it! As an educator I literally count down to the day we get rid of Betsy.
9550,2020-08-20 02:24:05,iczcla,"Absolutley, no question about it"
9551,2020-08-20 02:25:06,iczcla,"She wouldn’t.

She isn’t very good at coordinating with other members of her own party let alone game out the opposite party. Plus, despite her probably being one of the most intellectual elected officials, she has really bad political instincts."
9552,2020-08-20 02:25:35,iczcla,"She would.

But she's also gonna make a fantastic Secretary of the Treasury"
9553,2020-08-20 02:23:55,iczcla,Same...
9554,2020-08-20 02:25:06,iczcla,Now it's motherfucking Shark Week.
9555,2020-08-20 02:26:15,iczcla,Sure is!
9556,2020-08-20 02:25:54,iczcla,Yes
9557,2020-08-20 02:25:36,iczcla,Don’t put that out into the universe
9558,2020-08-20 02:25:57,iczcla,He gave it to rush fucking limbaugh which is actually worse
9559,2020-08-20 02:25:58,iczcla,"Already awarded it to Rush Limbaugh, not much better"
9560,2020-08-20 02:26:35,iczcla,"I mean he awarded it to Rush Fn Limbaugh, so...yeah, he probably will"
9561,2020-08-20 02:26:17,iczcla,He’s already done worse so.....
9562,2020-08-20 02:30:13,iczcla,Pool photography plus not staging extra cameras because they would've tipped off Joe equals a wonderful moment only being captured well in still photos.
9563,2020-08-20 02:28:18,iczcla,When was he not?!
9564,2020-08-20 02:30:20,iczcla,Hillary!
9565,2020-08-20 02:33:13,iczcla,"Obama administration would be getting investigated for losing 1,000 people. :/"
9566,2020-08-20 02:31:02,iczcla,Dramatic zoom
9567,2020-08-20 02:36:06,iczcla,"Yes... he knows they are ""lazy"" and can he can use illegal immigrants without having to pay benefits or taxes."
9568,2020-08-20 02:36:29,iczcla,doubt it
9569,2020-08-20 02:40:45,iczcla,Can we just throw up rather than having to even look at a picture that has Trump?
9570,2020-08-20 02:37:47,iczcla,Ahem. Fish filet.
9571,2020-08-20 02:39:23,iczcla,He's rage tweeting right now.
9572,2020-08-20 02:39:23,iczcla,Trump’s upset that McDonalds spit into his Quarter Pounder and found no fries at the bottom of the bag.
9573,2020-08-20 02:42:26,iczcla,Quote of the night
9574,2020-08-20 02:43:02,iczcla,me too
9575,2020-08-20 02:48:12,iczcla,"Definitely. America is a total mess but our economy, and our country not falling completely apart, is too important to ignore. They don't want to get demolished by the falling debris."
9576,2020-08-20 02:48:32,iczcla,Canadian here. Inspiring night. But I felt the same after the 2016 Democratic convention.
9577,2020-08-20 02:48:51,iczcla,[deleted]
9578,2020-08-20 02:53:54,iczcla,As long as it's not read in Spanish. Lol.
9579,2020-08-20 02:55:42,iczcla,Will help me remember how to properly pronounce her name!
9580,2020-08-20 03:09:45,iczcla,Its spelled hamberders.
9581,2020-08-20 03:18:54,iczcla,It was awkward...but it’s even more proof that Joe is something Donald Trump could never be...he’s a real fucking human being.
9582,2020-08-20 03:28:51,iczcla,Let's hope so.
9583,2020-08-20 03:17:45,iczcla,"Oh he absolutely is, and he'll say it's what Obama did, so it's fine. That's why Don Jr tweeted that Obama's spying was ""breaking a 240 year tradition of peaceful transition of power"". They can say that tradition is broken already, and it wasn't their fault."
9584,2020-08-20 03:18:00,iczcla,I mean do we really need Trump to confirm that in order to know it’s true?
9585,2020-08-20 03:17:06,iczcla,"He tweeted twice during Obamas speech lol.

r/trumptweets"
9586,2020-08-20 03:28:41,iczcla,This is more effective TV at a fraction of the cost. The only people who'll miss the traditional conventions are those few of us who got to attend some.
9587,2020-08-20 03:29:28,iczcla,go *back* in 2024? you're so hopeful...I wish I had that kind of hope.
9588,2020-08-20 04:26:03,iczcla,"I think we see a mix. Live speeches for the headliners, so you get the energy from a cheering crowd, but pretty much everything else will be live streamed."
9589,2020-08-20 03:37:18,iczcla,He should let Obama write it
9590,2020-08-20 03:39:30,iczcla,I hope he does medicare for all. Would literally win the election on the spot. Just not worth not doing it. Such an easy win
9591,2020-08-20 03:43:44,iczcla,"The bad-ass women montage. Gabby Giffords. Billie Eilish. (No, really.)"
9592,2020-08-20 03:43:14,iczcla,"the story of estella, daughter of a marine who voted for Trump. Trump deported her mother(it's hard not to cry)"
9593,2020-08-20 03:43:26,iczcla,"Gabby Giffrods.

Acutally, watch the entire thing tbh. Everything was so strong."
9594,2020-08-20 03:42:57,iczcla,"Giffords, immigration."
9595,2020-08-20 04:08:12,iczcla,The Pelosi rockstar montage
9596,2020-08-20 03:43:21,iczcla,Obama and Harris were the highlight
9597,2020-08-20 03:54:34,iczcla,"He gets put in his place by Van Jones.  Bottom, Right."
9598,2020-08-20 03:46:49,iczcla,[deleted]
9599,2020-08-20 03:47:01,iczcla,"I think he is still there, maybe his internet stinks which means he cannot conference in"
9600,2020-08-20 04:05:11,iczcla,"I hafta say, I enjoyed him as the ""Republican commentator"" a heck of a lot more than the guy they've had for the last couple of nights."
9601,2020-08-20 00:24:44,iczcla,That's because he's constantly stoned on some good sativa like lemon haze.
9602,2020-08-20 00:20:07,iczcla,Bill Gates does the same thing.
9603,2020-08-20 00:37:26,iczcla,"I'm not sure it would have made a difference but Kaine was a terrible pick. I can't think of what he looks or sounds like because he's utterly forgettable. 

I was happy with Kamala because I'm sure she'll do well as an attack dog. I'm looking forward to her speech."
9604,2020-08-20 00:32:56,iczcla,You can put lipstick on a pig...
9605,2020-08-20 00:35:03,iczcla,That was a huge part of *Game Change*.  Palin got into tons of fights with McCain’s strategy staff.  Including Palin wanting to speak at McCain’s concession.
9606,2020-08-20 00:42:02,iczcla,"At the end of that when he says to *Sarah Palin* 'people get the peers they deserve', I appreciated the unintended irony."
9607,2020-08-20 00:43:05,iczcla,"“Opinion hosts” (on either side) are the result of Murdoch, Limbaugh, and think tanks. The right wing propaganda machine can’t be left unanswered, and we are left with this mess of 24 hour news networks with hours of opinions.

It’s disgraceful, and exacerbates compulsively, ignorance, and complacency by the American public."
9608,2020-08-20 00:55:48,iczcla,"I just watch Joe's youtube feed.  No announcers, they play the convention as it's meant."
9609,2020-08-20 00:46:08,iczcla,I'm so confused. I'm watching an MSNBC livestream on YouTube and there's no anchors or reporters.
9610,2020-08-20 01:11:16,iczcla,It's sad. I'm a lefty who owns a gun and at one point almost joined the NRA. The last 10 years proved they're just R hacks.
9611,2020-08-20 01:43:41,iczcla,The amount of collective trauma even pre-Covid and pre Floyd protests that we have been through together has been immense in the last 3 years.
9612,2020-08-20 01:44:58,iczcla,"Yes! I just wrote out something similar, but deleted. How can anyone hate this?! Like damn. Excuse me for enjoying to see what others offer me along with their presence. There is good and bad in all. Let's focus on our happiness. Let's get back to being united. Fuck division and hate."
9613,2020-08-20 01:45:47,iczcla,Did for two seconds or so.
9614,2020-08-20 01:45:33,iczcla,Yes
9615,2020-08-20 01:46:37,iczcla,yes
9616,2020-08-20 01:46:44,iczcla,Switch to the DNC stream. It's working fine.
9617,2020-08-20 01:45:37,iczcla,Yeah I had to switch
9618,2020-08-20 01:45:39,iczcla,Yup.
9619,2020-08-20 01:51:23,iczcla,If you strike me down I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine
9620,2020-08-20 02:00:19,iczcla,"Point out the obvious meaningless observations, doing the lords work sir, keep it up 👍"
9621,2020-08-20 02:23:57,iczcla,"Me too man, me too."
9622,2020-08-20 02:39:01,iczcla,"His tweets tonight are pathetic.

They used to be pathetic, but they still are tonight, too."
9623,2020-08-20 02:59:39,iczcla,Hahaha :-) :-) :-)
9624,2020-08-20 03:00:22,iczcla,No.  She’s a veteran pro at this shit
9625,2020-08-20 03:01:33,iczcla,"I feel these personal stories is a bit cheesy, not really for me."
9626,2020-08-20 03:48:18,iczcla,"He usually hosts 11pm, it's his slot to be fair"
9627,2020-08-20 03:52:00,iczcla,Them 3 have been killing it.
9628,2020-08-20 03:56:04,iczcla,They took Chris Hayes’ slot already lol. If you want a talking heads panel go to CNN.
9629,2020-08-20 04:16:07,iczcla,I thought Rachel took a little shot at Brian when talking about Harris’ predator jab. Wasn’t aware he was accused of sexual assault.
9630,2020-08-20 03:50:59,iczcla,"They got the whole hour before, and Joy got the whole hour before that (her usual slot)."
9631,2020-08-20 04:00:34,iczcla,Because his show 11th Hour airs regularly during the week at 11:00 PM.   So they summarize then hand the show back to him after a half hour or so.
9632,2020-08-20 04:21:53,iczcla,Brian Williams was accused of sexual assault?
9633,2020-08-20 04:02:58,iczcla,"Only Ron Swanson knew more Tammy's, he was married to them"
9634,2020-08-20 04:09:04,iczcla,Bloomberg is talking because he's giving $60m to House candidates this cycle.
9635,2020-08-20 04:09:38,iczcla,This convention isn’t for safe Biden voters. It’s for swing voters
9636,2020-08-20 04:38:59,iczcla,"If I were Graham I don't think I'd reign him in. I'd let him go full on wacko. He can publicly give him a bit of support, but he's got to be thinking about his post-Trump career at this point."
9637,2020-08-20 00:10:09,iczcla,She's so close to entering IDGAF mode that we can taste it. She's recently started to say things we couldn't even imagine she would say before so I have hope.
9638,2020-08-20 00:10:42,iczcla,She threw some good shade at [Comey's self-unaware tweet yesterday](https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/1295818174752006147).
9639,2020-08-20 00:19:09,iczcla,"> buttery males 

I don't understand this phrase."
9640,2020-08-20 00:27:43,iczcla,"> give her an anger translator. 

I'm fascinated by this.  Nominations?

Edit: Melissa McCarthy. :D"
9641,2020-08-20 00:44:44,iczcla,Her and Obama's speech are going to be really good.
9642,2020-08-20 00:11:09,iczcla,"I wish the Clintons would just decline and back off, TBH. Whether you like them or don’t, the more they tie themselves to someone, the more shit they bring.

9671,2020-08-20 02:46:42,iczcla,I wouldn't get my hopes up. Their main complaint about President Obama was that his policies didn't live up to his rhetoric. Giving a compelling speech doesn't counter that narrative.
9672,2020-08-20 04:50:25,iczcla,"He was really emotional. At least by his normal standard. Don't get me wrong he was still extremely poised and well spoken. But he was definitely speaking from a place of great passion, anger, and determination. Passion in his love for the country and how far we have come, anger because of how much damage Trump has done to the country and how far we still have to go to make this a truly free country, and determination because he knows how great this country can be and how hard we need to reach that greatness."
9673,2020-08-20 05:07:03,iczcla,"He loves America, he loves what it is and he loves what it could be.  And he is watching it be destroyed from within by a traitor.  You would get choked up to if your life's work was being smashed by a insolent man-child."
9674,2020-08-20 04:45:53,iczcla,"He’s probably pissed at the nation he worked so hard to rebuild has gone down the path of utter chaos since he left office. It doesn’t help that the man who smeared him and his family with awful conspiracies, and is overall one of the worst human beings in recent memory, is sitting in the most powerful position on the planet..."
9675,2020-08-20 04:46:18,iczcla,"He wasn't speaking to a big cheering auditorium, he scaled his speech differently for people watching TV - its a more intimate approach."
9676,2020-08-20 04:45:54,iczcla,That's because he cares deeply for America and Trump and his supporters are destroying it.  Obama knows America may end in November.
9677,2020-08-20 05:00:28,iczcla,He definitely got choked up and emotional. Incredible speech.
9678,2020-08-20 05:32:20,iczcla,He is the saddest we ever seen him.
9679,2020-08-20 04:49:07,iczcla,"He's one of the best orators in history, but he feeds off of a crowd. His speech was great, but in front of 80,000 people it would have been better."

Parenting poor means you leave your kids with less than ideal caregivers because they are the ones approved to accept your meager childcare allowance from the state. Parenting poor means you sometimes come home from work and picking up kids from daycare without power because you couldn't afford to buy food and pay your electric bill. Parenting poor means you wait to buy the school supplies and clothes until the last minute. Parenting poor means your son's teacher calls you and scolds you for not getting him the haircut she seems to think he needed. It. Fucking. Sucked.

9929,2020-08-20 01:27:44,iczcla,Without voter suppression we wouldn't need them. Their views are still dated and unproductive.

As long as we don't start pushing for tax cuts to the rich and school vouchers (as examples), it's good to welcome these people to our side, even if it's only temporary."
9933,2020-08-20 01:38:27,iczcla,"I agree but sadly plenty of liberals still hold extremely degrading views toward the rural United States which holds many of these types of voters. What I think most of them don't realize is that many of these red areas were once Democratic strongholds who turned red after being failed by their leadership over and over again. Of course the GOP isn't going to save them whatsoever, but the constant degradation I see toward citizens of the rural south by liberals and news media is mindblowing. I'd say you'll find that a huge portion of people in MAGA country didn't even vote at all because they are so disaffected to begin with. Degrading comments that alienate these people further aren't going to help anything. 

My biggest problem with Joe, even though I'm voting for him, is the fact that I really can't count on his campaign to inspire any disaffected voters to actually show up for him. I was fucking devastated to see how he spoke to workers on the campaign trail, and I think that's a little microcosmic slice of the problem with his campaign as a whole."
9934,2020-08-20 02:52:14,iczcla,Just think of it as a vote against Trump.

9937,2020-08-20 02:53:38,iczcla,I hope you don’t get downvoted for sharing your true feelings. I was Bernie 16 and Warren 20. I hear what you’re saying but we need ya. We’ll be so much worse off with another 4 years of Trump and that much farther from a true progressive president. I hope you’ll help us kick some ass at the ballot box.

If Trump is re-elected, it means another four years of fighting policies as opposed to four years of proposing legislation. And if you're not voting for you, please, please vote for people who are literally dying because of Trump's incompetence. Biden's a lot of things. He's not the best. But he's competent and he's surrounded himself with people who are all that and more."

9966,2020-08-20 02:03:51,iczcla,I guess their base likes it? I've given up trying to figure those idiots out.
9967,2020-08-20 02:04:12,iczcla,lol man do they know how to play that idiot base like a fiddle
9968,2020-08-20 02:11:49,iczcla,"What is that weird thing supposed to be? Oh, let me guess, is that an overview of the comprehensive Republican platform for addressing the multifarious problems facing a nation in a pandemic and recession? Is that what that is?"
9969,2020-08-20 03:03:18,iczcla,Don’t be surprised if it changes to that. You’re crazy if you don’t think there are constant eyes on these threads.
9970,2020-08-20 03:40:54,iczcla,Honestly Biden is a pretty good speaker. It's when he goes off the cuff that he gets into trouble.
9971,2020-08-20 02:08:55,iczcla,"Yeah. America in the past, and parts today, were really fucked up. It also wasn't considered rape if a husband came home and had non consensual sex"
9972,2020-08-20 02:08:58,iczcla,This is why we vote!
9973,2020-08-20 02:10:34,iczcla,"“What was she wearing?”

“Was she drunk?”

“She was asking for it.”

Edit: I realize this isn’t typical responses for domestic abuse, but “She should just leave” is."
9974,2020-08-20 02:10:30,iczcla,And that’s how it used to be
9975,2020-08-20 02:12:07,iczcla,"Worse. The Catholic church used to teach that if their husband abused them, it was their fault for not being a good wife. 


Some evangelical churches still do, as do churches in Latin America."
9976,2020-08-20 02:08:42,iczcla,Hm?
9977,2020-08-20 01:35:53,iczcla,Like the new Bob Dylan.
9978,2020-08-20 03:22:14,iczcla,"> He just makes everyone after him lacking in comparison.

I thought Kamala held her own after him."
9979,2020-08-20 03:23:06,iczcla,Apparently he was supposed to go last tonight but wanted to go before Kamala as to “pass the torch” so to speak.
9980,2020-08-20 03:22:56,iczcla,"Someone earlier mentioned it was done that way on purpose as a sort of ""pass the torch"" moment."
9981,2020-08-20 01:27:24,iczcla,"Foreign Interference in US election.

Fox News and Rush Limbaugh would ranting about it for months."
9982,2020-08-20 01:26:48,iczcla,My God. I can only imagine his twitter storm
9983,2020-08-20 01:27:07,iczcla,As a Swede (watching this at 3.30am over here) I whole-heartedly agree!
9984,2020-08-20 01:14:56,iczcla,Yup. Just more regulations and accountability
9985,2020-08-20 01:20:45,iczcla,He backed away from politics. You can’t force people to do things they don’t want to do.
9986,2020-08-20 01:19:07,iczcla,"They also don't have Inslee, but there are lots of climate people"
9987,2020-08-20 01:22:05,iczcla,"If Romney pops up as a ""fuck you"" to Trump I'd be ecstatic. Not because I'm a fan of his (I'm most certainly not) but because it would get under Trump's skin in a massive way."
9988,2020-08-20 01:25:15,iczcla,They've got Billie Eilish so that's something?
9989,2020-08-20 01:22:42,iczcla,Upvote for username
9990,2020-08-20 01:28:20,iczcla,"Oh really, I thought you were being genuine"
9991,2020-08-20 01:33:38,iczcla,"It's about attracting the youth vote. 

Releasing a never before heard song during the DNC is a big deal."
9992,2020-08-20 01:33:47,iczcla,Lorde is kinda borderline but more zoomer at 23 tbh
9993,2020-08-20 01:42:22,iczcla,"I'm in Pittsburgh. I can pretty much guarantee that this shit isn't playing well here at all.


Will it ignite the base in California? Sure. But the rust belt cares about jobs. It's almost comical that Democrats are forgetting that again."
9994,2020-08-20 01:41:56,iczcla,Just remember that Trump won in those states in large part because Democrats didn't show up. If Dems show up they win. Especially if they win over the suburbs which have turned hard against Trump.
9995,2020-08-20 01:41:49,iczcla,"Tonight has a lot of controversial stuff in it, gun reform, climate change, immigration, they are kind of cramming it all together in one episode. Lots of things that would piss off my republican family"
9996,2020-08-20 01:51:08,iczcla,Cuz he’s a great dude
9997,2020-08-20 01:51:35,iczcla,That's cause he is a good person?  Kinda like the Keanu of politics.
9998,2020-08-20 01:56:09,iczcla,I think most politicians who get to his point have great personal relationships to showcase.
9999,2020-08-20 02:05:13,iczcla,And Mariska Hargitay to you as well.
10000,2020-08-20 02:21:29,iczcla,Biden will invest $500 billion a year into green energy
10001,2020-08-20 02:22:32,iczcla,That's not how capitalism works
10002,2020-08-20 02:21:12,iczcla,Hopefully Senate Majority Leader.
10003,2020-08-20 02:22:04,iczcla,Truth!
10004,2020-08-20 02:51:46,iczcla,Calm down.  Nothing is set in stone yet.  It's going to take a HELL of a lot of hard work and perseverance to fix this fucking nightmare.
10005,2020-08-20 03:24:24,iczcla,"Don't forget, over a third of the country believes that if ""the radical leftists"" win, that they'll all be rounded up and killed by antifa and BLM and their babies will be raped and eaten. It's a CERTAINTY that Trump will use this to rouse them to violence if and when he loses. There's no maybe about it, this year will see much bloodshed."
10006,2020-08-20 03:49:13,iczcla,"Yo what makes a good bath towel?

Rough as hell, right?"
10007,2020-08-20 05:01:20,iczcla,"The shroud of the darkside has fallen. Begun, the Drumpf Wars has."
10008,2020-08-20 04:47:04,iczcla,I'd say it was 90% probably intentional
10009,2020-08-20 00:28:14,iczcla,60 million to house races is hard to pass up.
10010,2020-08-20 00:27:24,iczcla,[60 Million reasons he got a good speaking spot.](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/512420-bloomberg-pledges-60m-to-boost-house-democrats-report)
10011,2020-08-20 00:27:33,iczcla,Hopefully he bought it with an absolute boatload of cash.
10012,2020-08-20 01:08:27,iczcla,Right?! I love Springsteen but give us something uptempo.
10013,2020-08-20 01:42:16,iczcla,"lol. Sorry, that just made me laugh.

It's the first comment I saw when I opened this thread."
10014,2020-08-20 01:45:59,iczcla,I'm waiting to take mine when the next speaker begins.
10015,2020-08-20 01:50:06,iczcla,The best photo of her is the one where she wore big sunglasses with her hair long while she gazed at her phone. It has a strong 1960s-cool vibe.
10016,2020-08-20 01:48:51,iczcla,Agreed
10017,2020-08-20 01:48:59,iczcla,"It kinda looks like a wig but I don't mind, still looks nice."
10018,2020-08-20 03:48:35,iczcla,[deleted]
10019,2020-08-20 03:51:00,iczcla,I actually needed hospitalization after the last election because I had trouble breathing and went through a deep depression for days.
10020,2020-08-20 03:49:44,iczcla,I 100% am taking off. Win or lose. I get that day.
10021,2020-08-20 03:54:32,iczcla,I'm not even sure how to cope if Biden doesn't end up winning.  Just to know Democracy is over is going to be so mentally damaging.
10022,2020-08-20 03:55:45,iczcla,I take every voting day and the following day off. It’s basically a drinking holiday for me.
10023,2020-08-20 03:54:39,iczcla,It's going to take more than a day to resolve. Think a couple of weeks.
10024,2020-08-20 01:08:36,iczcla,Gong Gong
10025,2020-08-20 01:18:42,iczcla,had to be Kolbuchar

10027,2020-08-20 01:18:16,iczcla,It was Michelle Obama
10028,2020-08-20 01:23:05,iczcla,Michelle
10029,2020-08-20 01:22:34,iczcla,I've been watching their YT stream since the start?
10030,2020-08-20 01:25:59,iczcla,Nikki Haley must be devastated
10031,2020-08-20 01:30:38,iczcla,Yes!
10032,2020-08-20 01:33:20,iczcla,Scott Baio all the way down.
10033,2020-08-20 01:37:13,iczcla,Toby Keith and Ted Nugent? Maybe Kid Rock?
10034,2020-08-20 01:33:28,iczcla,Hank Williams Jr. & David Allan Coe just saying the N word for 3 minutes
10035,2020-08-20 01:32:14,iczcla,"Kid Rock

Rumor is he's going to do a duet with the my pillow guy"
10036,2020-08-20 01:32:32,iczcla,"Kanye, Nuget and Kid Rock. 

I’m guessing"
10037,2020-08-20 01:32:43,iczcla,Another cease and desist from Bruce Springsteen.
10038,2020-08-20 01:32:36,iczcla,The Nuge and Kid Rock.
10039,2020-08-20 01:32:38,iczcla,Kid Rock and Ted Nugent I bet.
10040,2020-08-20 01:33:18,iczcla,Unknown Hinson
10041,2020-08-20 01:34:32,iczcla,The kids that trump stiffed? (I'll let you guess the meaning)
10042,2020-08-20 01:39:48,iczcla,Came on a boat from Germany in the early 1800s.
10043,2020-08-20 01:51:50,iczcla,"Agreed. This is actually making me a bit nervous and worried . They keep showing people of color and that’s great but they really should show that white Americans are also welcome and a part of the Democratic Party to not scare off white people 

White Americans also immigrated here , why not show some unity with them ?"
10044,2020-08-20 01:48:34,iczcla,Sounds like Oprah
10045,2020-08-20 02:04:04,iczcla,"Trump outraised Biden last quarter and has more cash on hand, but not by an overwhelming advantage."
10046,2020-08-20 02:05:12,iczcla,"I believe Biden’s doing well

Please check Jaime Harrison or Cal Cunningham senate campaigns, GOP is throwing mad cash against them"
10047,2020-08-20 02:15:40,iczcla,Tim Scott! The one black person they have in the senate!
10048,2020-08-20 02:15:55,iczcla,"Honestly, if people watch FOX as their main news source, they are likely lost to us."
10049,2020-08-20 02:17:16,iczcla,"Much less than half, but yes, she's fucking incompetent."
10050,2020-08-20 02:30:48,iczcla,"As far as I can tell, not before they ran, but many afterwards -- all the presidents from JFK to Clinton (save Nixon), Barry Goldwater, Hubert Humphrey, George McGovern, and Bob Dole, plus many others who ran but didn't get nominated like Jesse Jackson, Strom Thurmond, and  Shirley Chisholm.

10052,2020-08-20 02:28:39,iczcla,He probably will..
10053,2020-08-20 02:35:49,iczcla,He's about the same age Hillary was when they ran against each other in 2008. You do show a lot of outward signs of aging between 47 and 59
10054,2020-08-20 02:29:20,iczcla,Not at all what he said.
10055,2020-08-20 02:33:07,iczcla,The Nation of Islam Obama impression was such a good premise. Best part is the joke was on Republicans and their birther hysteria.

10067,2020-08-20 03:24:26,iczcla,Cspan YouTube is where I watched last night’s convention
10068,2020-08-20 03:52:42,iczcla,Might be because he’s horrible?
10069,2020-08-20 04:10:50,iczcla,"And if he was part of the Democratic Convention, his political career as a Republican would also be over."
10070,2020-08-20 04:39:58,iczcla,That dude needs to smile more.
10071,2020-08-20 01:49:24,iczcla,Nasty gal in the house!
10072,2020-08-20 04:46:49,iczcla,She doesn’t believe anything she says. Girl is just trying to make a paycheck
10073,2020-08-20 05:22:42,iczcla,To be honest I liked klobuchar. I hope she keeps up her work for the next 8 years and comes back with even more under her belt
10074,2020-08-20 05:24:40,iczcla,lol this is why you don't trust ghouls like her and the Lincoln Party
10075,2020-08-20 04:14:20,iczcla,it's kind of sad what happened to ann coulter. she used to be relevant.
10076,2020-08-20 02:53:57,iczcla,Rouge One?
10077,2020-08-20 02:54:21,iczcla,Man I thought something similar. That was badass. lol
10078,2020-08-20 03:05:55,iczcla,"Nope, it’s her night and she’s killing.  He teed her up, and she’s knocking it out of the park"
10079,2020-08-20 03:05:52,iczcla,Obama wanted Kamala to close out as a symbolic pass the torch.
10080,2020-08-20 03:06:56,iczcla,"They wanted to, he asked to switch to open for Kamala as a ‘passing the torch’ symbol."
10081,2020-08-20 03:06:35,iczcla,"I read that that was the original plan, and that Obama asked to go before Harris out of respect/passing the torch."
10082,2020-08-20 03:06:59,iczcla,"Word is he was scheduled to, but Obama requested the switch. In agree with the decision."
10083,2020-08-20 03:06:51,iczcla,they were going to be he specifically asked to switch so that he could pass the torch to Kamala
10084,2020-08-20 03:06:06,iczcla,He requested to go before Kamala.
10085,2020-08-20 03:05:43,iczcla,They were going to but he wanted to give her his spot
10086,2020-08-20 03:13:50,iczcla,"Right!! It’s always some white dude rock song playing, this is a nice change"
10087,2020-08-20 04:16:35,iczcla,He's a New Yorker from Queens.
10088,2020-08-20 04:29:53,iczcla,He's almost as intolerable as Joe S.; both love to hear themselves talk.
10089,2020-08-20 04:30:57,iczcla,"Yeah, he's often annoying to be honest & he's far too often kind of hyper emotional with his language and tone, if ya know what I mean?

I don't care for any of that, it's sort of like Fox or right wing talk radio outrage crap."
10090,2020-08-20 04:53:54,iczcla,I actually agree with Cuomo's comparison. It has nothing to do with the civility of the speech (which Obama's was exemplary) but the fact he did not hold anything back. He was direct and laid down the gauntlet of what was at stake.
10091,2020-08-20 04:59:46,iczcla,[deleted]
10092,2020-08-20 01:55:56,iczcla,I know lol! That was awesome.
10093,2020-08-20 00:19:00,iczcla,Hacks on Tap is my favorite political podcast.
10094,2020-08-20 00:25:59,iczcla,His love for that touch screen he has in unparalleled. I swear he clicks stuff just to click around half the time.
10095,2020-08-20 00:54:35,iczcla,But Q said...
10096,2020-08-20 00:54:17,iczcla,You know that won't stop them.
10097,2020-08-20 00:57:45,iczcla,What other cases?
10098,2020-08-20 01:01:26,iczcla,So what other cases is Durham working on?
10099,2020-08-20 00:57:59,iczcla,It was never a conspiracy.
10100,2020-08-20 01:17:32,iczcla,"John Stamos is young John Stamos.

10102,2020-08-20 01:42:30,iczcla,Loved the sign language person the last two night. I'm not using that feed this time though. I should just go find it. It's worth it.
10103,2020-08-20 01:43:19,iczcla,It's not on what I'm watching. PBS news hour on Youtube. Where are you watching?
10104,2020-08-20 01:51:37,iczcla,Not yet. Later.

10108,2020-08-20 01:52:58,iczcla,she spoke on monday
10109,2020-08-20 01:53:38,iczcla,"Nah dog, you got another 45 mins I’d guess"
10110,2020-08-20 01:51:45,iczcla,No
10111,2020-08-20 01:51:50,iczcla,Nope

10115,2020-08-20 01:52:35,iczcla,Last one speaking . Headline
10116,2020-08-20 01:54:59,iczcla,"Hmmm, do I watch playoff hockey or Obama?

Why the hell don’t TVs have picture in picture any more? It was all the rage in the 90s."
10117,2020-08-20 01:56:11,iczcla,"She would have, but they would have impeached her if 300 people died."
10118,2020-08-20 02:48:17,iczcla,It was fire. Definitely planned well and increased the impact of his speech I think.
10119,2020-08-20 02:49:31,iczcla,"That fade! Dawg, that shit was dope!"

10130,2020-08-20 01:18:50,iczcla,WaPo feed doesn’t do extra commentary or commercials. I watched on one of the networks  the first night and was pissed how much I missed.
10131,2020-08-20 01:19:20,iczcla,PBS is great too
10132,2020-08-20 01:21:38,iczcla,PBS is not showing any commercials but cut into DNC video quite a bit.
10133,2020-08-20 01:18:45,iczcla,"I expected an end of hour break, not one this early. At least they are back"
10134,2020-08-20 01:19:52,iczcla,Yes it's annoying. I prefer the commentary on CNN but they keep going to commercials during the program. I'm sticking with MSNBC or CSpan.
10135,2020-08-20 01:51:22,iczcla,I don’t think how she looked lost her the election
10136,2020-08-20 02:10:56,iczcla,What power does she have to compel senate republicans to do anything?
10137,2020-08-20 02:11:43,iczcla,She has the House pretty unified. The Senate is the problem right now. Not really sure what can be done to swing a group that's entirely entrenched politically.
10138,2020-08-20 02:13:42,iczcla,Does she?
10139,2020-08-20 02:39:16,iczcla,"Obama has always been a great speaker — after all, it’s how he rose to fame in 2004."
10140,2020-08-20 04:04:23,iczcla,You’re also in way too crucial of a state to vote for anybody else. This is literally do or die for us my friend.
10141,2020-08-20 01:28:41,iczcla,We have been careening wildly off the intended timeline since 2012.
10142,2020-08-20 02:12:38,iczcla,Awesome car. I think Biden still has his.
10143,2020-08-20 02:48:00,iczcla,There wasn't a term limit when FDR ran a third time. That's WHY the Republicans got that passed...so it wouldn't happen again.
10144,2020-08-20 01:36:07,iczcla,The conservative media preys on people who don't know better with lies and manipulation
10145,2020-08-20 01:16:57,iczcla,"Isn’t that illegal...?

(Yes, I know.  “Isn’t that illegal?” is the unofficial motto of the past 4 years)."
10146,2020-08-20 01:17:56,iczcla,What do you mean? Military standing there as he accepts? That would be so weird. Is he still planning on doing it from the WH?
10147,2020-08-20 01:17:15,iczcla,"Oh wow. That is super illegal.

I’m sure he will do it."
10148,2020-08-20 01:18:06,iczcla,"Ask any of your friends who are currently serving, and see what they think of 45."
10149,2020-08-20 01:18:49,iczcla,That’s actually terrifying
10150,2020-08-20 01:19:43,iczcla,Uhhhh Hatch act anyone???

10154,2020-08-20 01:17:44,iczcla,Props. Literal props.
10155,2020-08-20 03:25:28,iczcla,Because this election is for all the marbles.
10156,2020-08-20 03:26:38,iczcla,I'm crying too
10157,2020-08-20 01:42:12,iczcla,Can the mods just sticky this comment? It's summarizes a good 50% of the comments here.
10158,2020-08-20 01:42:30,iczcla,Who will speak for the r/WhitePeopleTwitter crowd?
10159,2020-08-20 01:42:39,iczcla,Where's the Nuge?!?!?
10160,2020-08-20 01:43:18,iczcla,Your comment is perfection and I'm stealing it.
10161,2020-08-20 01:43:26,iczcla,Clearly they don't care about ***real*** Americans 😠😠😠😠
10162,2020-08-20 02:58:59,iczcla,Glad I'm not the only one that heard that
10163,2020-08-20 01:01:17,iczcla,"Nope, this is a new group of Republicans.

Which makes you have to wonder are there any Republicans proud to vote for Trump, who are willing to say it on national TV?"
10164,2020-08-20 01:01:50,iczcla,I think they cued the wrong thing. They were supposed to go right into the pledge
10165,2020-08-20 01:08:25,iczcla,Yeah I might tap out for a bit for that.
10166,2020-08-20 01:07:21,iczcla,"If that's a real strategy, it seems pretty good"

10174,2020-08-20 02:09:45,iczcla,I think it's a double last name.

10180,2020-08-20 01:12:45,iczcla,"Why? 

Biden’s gun plan doesn’t strip anything at all, it requires people to register shit.

I disagree that he’s using the word “ban,” but read what it says."
10181,2020-08-20 02:58:58,iczcla,There are some state delegates in the audience
10182,2020-08-20 02:59:57,iczcla,A lot of people feel uncomfortable if it feels like they're being stared at. It's a typical presentation technique (breaking eye contact with the camera).
10183,2020-08-20 02:59:24,iczcla,She is not in an empty venue.
10184,2020-08-20 02:59:44,iczcla,There is press there
10185,2020-08-20 02:59:35,iczcla,"Teleprompters left, right and center. Looks good when there's a crowd so you're kinda looking around at everyone, a tad awkward in this situation."
10186,2020-08-20 02:59:45,iczcla,Prob directing attention to various audience members like you'd do if it were a full house
10187,2020-08-20 02:59:48,iczcla,There are people in the room with her
10188,2020-08-20 02:59:40,iczcla,probably habit
10189,2020-08-20 03:00:20,iczcla,There are photographers in the room across from her.

10193,2020-08-20 01:18:58,iczcla,I was thinking the same thing.
10194,2020-08-20 01:19:06,iczcla,it feels very ...weird... now
10195,2020-08-20 01:19:08,iczcla,it sounds...moany

10198,2020-08-20 01:21:16,iczcla,"I mean at least it's not like in 2016 when we listened to Katy Perry's Roar for 90 minutes on repeat.  Like don't get me wrong, I really loved the song the first 27 times, but 28 was just too much man."
10199,2020-08-20 02:56:26,iczcla,Podium too big
10200,2020-08-20 02:57:43,iczcla,Looks like they’re going to keep going back to it.  :/
10201,2020-08-20 02:57:47,iczcla,Why is there a barrier that they probably can't see over?
10202,2020-08-20 03:00:20,iczcla,"I like it, it's a nice reminder of the mess we're in due to Trump. It's also normalizing social distancing and reinforcing the idea that the pandemic is very much still happening."

10293,2020-08-20 01:33:22,iczcla,Brand new song debuting tonight. Can't wait to see 45s tweets
10294,2020-08-20 01:42:59,iczcla,His name is prince sooo
10295,2020-08-20 02:23:44,iczcla,She’s such a strong speaker. She just misses the bullshit charisma needed to run for president.
10296,2020-08-20 02:37:20,iczcla,agreed
10297,2020-08-20 02:39:45,iczcla,Hard to say. The Republicans hadn't become so ridiculously obstructionist during Clinton's terms (despite the impeachment). The idea of not confirming a supreme court judge just wouldn't have happened in 1999.
10298,2020-08-20 02:40:09,iczcla,"Obama had to face a much worse republican congress for most of his time in office. Newt gingrich was awful, but mitch and the tea party took it to another level."
10299,2020-08-20 02:43:46,iczcla,"He's totally not watching, guys, totally"
10300,2020-08-20 02:51:18,iczcla,its just for show man. im sure they all hate each other. dont you absolutely hate your family?
10301,2020-08-20 02:52:05,iczcla,She's got Too Short in her veins.
10302,2020-08-20 02:56:23,iczcla,Why not? This was going to be the only chance she'd ever have to give this speech and the venue was paid for.
10303,2020-08-20 02:59:59,iczcla,"Well, you get the same shots you were going to get, and there are an appropriate number of socially distanced people in the audience."
10304,2020-08-20 02:55:31,iczcla,[deleted]
10305,2020-08-20 03:21:32,iczcla,"Actually, they are conveying the tone of both the speaker and music when they sign. Cant exactly hear a fast, happy tempo, or sarcasm for example."
10306,2020-08-20 03:16:05,iczcla,I like when he plays air guitar and air piano
10307,2020-08-20 03:22:11,iczcla,They were so good. Omg.
10308,2020-08-20 14:19:51,iczcla,1 hr 56 min 38 sec
10309,2020-08-20 01:31:39,iczcla,Relatable.
10310,2020-08-20 01:32:14,iczcla,Her eyes — she was high af
10311,2020-08-20 01:11:50,iczcla,Assault weapons ban as part of the crime bill in the 1990s.
10312,2020-08-20 01:13:07,iczcla,"[The Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act or Federal Assault Weapons Ban (AWB) was a subsection of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, a United States federal law which included a prohibition on the manufacture for civilian use of certain semi-automatic firearms that were defined as assault weapons as well as certain ammunition magazines that were defined as ""large capacity"".](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Assault_Weapons_Ban)"
10313,2020-08-20 01:12:41,iczcla,The 90's assault rifle ban maybe
10314,2020-08-20 01:12:55,iczcla,They are a dying organization.  Basically just money laundering front
10315,2020-08-20 01:11:39,iczcla,I'm not sure
10316,2020-08-20 01:18:56,iczcla,"There's a subsection titled ""Gun policy"" on [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Joe_Biden#Gun_policy) page that has a summary."
10317,2020-08-20 02:13:34,iczcla,"Dem establishment? I mean, voters like me who are lifelong Democrats are part of the community.

There isn't some crazy cabal sitting out there - people like you and me influence the people and the policies."
10318,2020-08-20 02:13:42,iczcla,I'm guessing that should say *hasn't*?
10319,2020-08-20 01:20:23,iczcla,It’s using up photons we can’t afford.
10320,2020-08-20 01:19:58,iczcla,It pollutes so much...
10321,2020-08-20 01:54:52,iczcla,That's what Trump is saying...
10322,2020-08-20 03:15:01,iczcla,"I kinda disagree. One for optics but also Biden is old and we don't know Kamalas underlying medical history. For the same reason both President and VP don't fly on the same plane, you don't have them get near each other so they don't end up on the shit end of the Covid stick"
10323,2020-08-20 03:15:53,iczcla,"It does look weird, but it's leadership. Demonstrating the behaviors you believe in."
10324,2020-08-20 03:18:52,iczcla,"Yeah, but I get why they don't. If one of them did get COVID, it would really be horrible for the whole ticket to be stuck in social isolation or the hospital for potentially 2+weeks. Meanwhile, Trump and Pence would be out campaigning and the Democrats could potentially lose out on a lot of valuable time."
10325,2020-08-20 03:13:21,iczcla,Yeah it’s really weird. You already know people are gonna be making fun of it. Expand their safe social bubble to include each other.
10326,2020-08-20 03:13:31,iczcla,Does Harris still have to do Senate work?
10327,2020-08-20 01:21:39,iczcla,"Protecting and extending the Affordable Care Act is core policy, important to voters. That came up -- yesterday? Not sure which day."
10328,2020-08-20 01:21:13,iczcla,is this your first DNC?
10329,2020-08-20 01:22:41,iczcla,"Have you seen many conventions? Not being snarky, they’re all like this content-wise. Plus they’ve been discussing policy every single day, communicating it through people’s stories."
10330,2020-08-20 01:22:47,iczcla,It's a pep rally.
10331,2020-08-20 01:20:48,iczcla,This is false
10332,2020-08-20 01:53:38,iczcla,Nope.  And she was a bit off.  It was $424 billion a few weeks ago.  Probably $500 billion by now.
10333,2020-08-20 01:54:29,iczcla,Hahaha... Nope
10334,2020-08-20 00:47:39,iczcla,CNN's overproduced debates were the worst
10335,2020-08-20 00:53:17,iczcla,"That's why I don't like a lot of what CNN does, so it's really funny when a Trump fan tells me I believe what I do because I watch CNN. 

I'd be happy if they never hosted a debate again."
10336,2020-08-20 01:27:33,iczcla,So will the Canadian Arctic. Not a desirable outcome. There's more to life than the Almighty Dollar.
10337,2020-08-20 01:34:05,iczcla,Who?
10338,2020-08-20 01:55:11,iczcla,She's speaking like someone who loves her country.
10339,2020-08-20 01:55:47,iczcla,To be fair we haven't reached the arrest our political rivals step on the dictator stairs. Yet.
10340,2020-08-20 02:26:29,iczcla,Pretty sure this is the only video because it's the White House (which is usually pool photography for events like these).
10341,2020-08-20 02:26:01,iczcla,Unfortunate
10342,2020-08-20 02:26:25,iczcla,I assume it works when everyone is sitting down
10343,2020-08-20 02:42:27,iczcla,Thanks bro
10344,2020-08-20 02:42:52,iczcla,You can feel his seething rage at knowing he is totally outclassed
10345,2020-08-20 02:42:41,iczcla,Obama doesn't like to influence elections....
10346,2020-08-20 02:54:15,iczcla,I think the stage already existed
10347,2020-08-20 02:54:03,iczcla,Wilmington
10348,2020-08-20 02:54:22,iczcla,Probably the convention center they were supposed to have the DNC at. They'd already paid for the venue and it's not like there's another concert or conference begging to use the space right now.
10349,2020-08-20 03:55:23,iczcla,"I think that’s there because Charlotte is considered the Queen City, so it’s showing a Queen’s crown. But I wouldn’t put anything past Republicans lol."
10350,2020-08-20 03:56:20,iczcla,"Charlotte is called the queen City, might be related"
10351,2020-08-20 03:55:28,iczcla,It’s the Charlotte city logo.
10352,2020-08-20 03:56:15,iczcla,"It's Charlotte's seal

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seal_of_Charlotte,_North_Carolina"
10353,2020-08-20 03:56:28,iczcla,"It's part of the flag of the city of Charlotte, NC."
10354,2020-08-20 03:56:45,iczcla," Charlotte , the queen city was going to be host originally. I dislike the RNC, but can see where the logo came from"
10355,2020-08-20 03:58:14,iczcla,"It's a reference to Charlotte, NC, where the RNC convention will be held.

Edited to add this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seal_of_Charlotte,_North_Carolina"
10356,2020-08-20 03:57:41,iczcla,Charlotte is the Queen City
10357,2020-08-20 04:02:16,iczcla,Posted like a true Democrat.
10358,2020-08-20 01:23:50,iczcla,And actions we’ve taken since then have helped... he was assuming no change. We did change
10359,2020-08-20 01:26:20,iczcla,Remember when the subways flooded in NYC
10360,2020-08-20 02:14:02,iczcla,"I agree. It seems like its boiled down for the maga crowd.  

It's no ""Yes we can"""
10361,2020-08-20 02:27:06,iczcla,"There are tons, idk why they used that one"
10362,2020-08-20 02:27:29,iczcla,"I've seen a different clip. It was a clearer, closer view of Obama & Biden.  Biden dabbed his eyes with his hanky."
10363,2020-08-20 02:28:32,iczcla,"I agree, but I'm struck by the fact that hardly anyone moved during the entire reading of the citation."
10364,2020-08-20 03:01:39,iczcla,Barack is a Cicero level orator.
10365,2020-08-20 03:00:55,iczcla,No one can follow Obama.
10366,2020-08-20 03:02:49,iczcla,"Barack Obama is probably the best orator of this generation... Harris though is doing a good job delivering what she needs to say, and she has only had a week or two to write and practice this."
10367,2020-08-20 03:02:10,iczcla,"It's hard to give a speech on a stage in conditions like this, but I agree with the choice. She's a woman running for VP, she has to project ""ready to go"". Putting her in a living room would have come across as housewife-y."
10368,2020-08-20 03:04:08,iczcla,Barry O is a completely different beast. Hes on a different level. It would take some of the OG legends to stand toe to toe with him. Kennedy maybe? .. Michelle is no slouch either. They are fucking brilliant
10369,2020-08-20 03:04:12,iczcla,"Obama’s speech was literal perfection. The exact right amounts of reason, emotion, anger, and call to action. I would definitely NOT want to follow that."
10370,2020-08-20 03:05:36,iczcla,Hard to follow a once in a generation orator :)
10371,2020-08-20 03:05:48,iczcla,I think her speech is fine. I like what she’s saying. But it’s not blowing my socks off either
10372,2020-08-20 03:01:13,iczcla,"I’m not a huge fan of hers, there’s a reason she didn’t make it to Iowa"
10373,2020-08-20 01:48:44,iczcla,"I appreciate the reminder that she's just a rando Congressman now and not someone that anyone outside of her district needs to care about, though."
10374,2020-08-20 02:01:03,iczcla,Who fucking cares?
10375,2020-08-20 01:31:37,iczcla,"You say that sarcastically, but it's about attracting the youth vote, and she's an incredibly popular artist amongst the youth demographic."
10376,2020-08-20 01:42:02,iczcla,ditto
10377,2020-08-20 02:00:07,iczcla,"Small mistakes are fine, life happens."
10378,2020-08-20 02:01:35,iczcla,I think that might have just been trump sending out a tweet.
10379,2020-08-20 02:01:09,iczcla,I thought the same 🙈
10380,2020-08-20 02:01:46,iczcla,Sorry.. taco bell.
10381,2020-08-20 02:01:24,iczcla,Flush the turd on Nov. 3.
10382,2020-08-20 02:02:09,iczcla,"I didn't want to say anything, but I admit I was wondering the same."
10383,2020-08-20 01:52:49,iczcla,Fuck those people.
10384,2020-08-20 02:10:02,iczcla,Healthcare was covered yesterday
10385,2020-08-20 02:09:58,iczcla,Wassnt that all yesterday?
10386,2020-08-20 02:10:27,iczcla,They did yesterday.
10387,2020-08-20 02:12:44,iczcla,"They did, yesterday."
10388,2020-08-20 02:10:20,iczcla,Noone cares about the issues... we just what this nightmare to end!
10389,2020-08-20 04:40:44,iczcla,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okJcX67klds&feature=youtu.be&fbclid=IwAR0b8UIHc9meLdR1ozsazZoNj2Ba_JMMxjlx7-olv9kn0CYtcibf3Gp_mZ0

Biden on healthcare... there's a reason they aren't talking about it"
10390,2020-08-20 00:39:01,iczcla,Second to last. He suggested Kamala end the night.
10391,2020-08-20 00:39:27,iczcla,Pretty confident he will be last
10392,2020-08-20 01:23:48,iczcla,I'm sick of that song...
10393,2020-08-20 01:26:31,iczcla,[deleted]
10394,2020-08-20 01:38:08,iczcla,"It was a brand new song, by an artist hugely popular amongst the youth demographic. 

It's all about attracting the youth vote. 

Plus if they had it in the convention center rather then via Zoom, musical numbers would make a lot more sense."
10395,2020-08-20 01:40:09,iczcla,I thought he was one of the speakers tonight?
10396,2020-08-20 01:40:39,iczcla,"He is officially scheduled to talk tonight, right before Harris accepts the nomination"
10397,2020-08-20 01:40:15,iczcla,"He’s the headliner tonight, so yeah."
10398,2020-08-20 01:40:41,iczcla,He’s already slated to talk tonight
10399,2020-08-20 01:40:22,iczcla,He’s already scheduled to speak tonight
10400,2020-08-20 01:40:38,iczcla,Not sure it’d be a surprise. He’s scheduled to speak tonight.
10401,2020-08-20 01:40:38,iczcla,Right before Kamala probably
10402,2020-08-20 01:41:09,iczcla,Obama is def tonight
10403,2020-08-20 01:40:37,iczcla,Yes.
10404,2020-08-20 01:41:18,iczcla,"Abit of modulation, sounds pretty clean to me and we'll mastered"
10405,2020-08-20 01:43:16,iczcla,Transparently.
10406,2020-08-20 01:42:29,iczcla,No
10407,2020-08-20 01:42:44,iczcla,Only if you live in the future.
10408,2020-08-20 01:42:53,iczcla,They keep the big names till the end
10409,2020-08-20 01:42:55,iczcla,probably 10:30 est
10410,2020-08-20 01:43:20,iczcla,"Nope, I am staying awake just for it, guessing around 10:30."
10411,2020-08-20 01:42:28,iczcla,Probably leaving it for last
10412,2020-08-20 01:42:53,iczcla,No it was a voice over images he's doing a speech later
10413,2020-08-20 01:42:56,iczcla,Not yet..
10414,2020-08-20 01:43:44,iczcla,Not yet
10415,2020-08-20 01:44:40,iczcla,"no, he's the closer I'm pretty sure"
10416,2020-08-20 01:51:40,iczcla,Her mic is under her lapel
10417,2020-08-20 01:52:08,iczcla,It's airing perfectly on CSPAN
10418,2020-08-20 01:51:36,iczcla,Mic problems
10419,2020-08-20 01:52:02,iczcla,"> What is that weird noise? 

Trump's hope for re-election dying"
10420,2020-08-20 01:52:51,iczcla,Probably wearing a lapel mic and its her clothes ruffling against it
10421,2020-08-20 01:53:17,iczcla,Microphone is slighty obscured probably
10422,2020-08-20 01:53:00,iczcla,Sounds fine to me
10423,2020-08-20 01:54:32,iczcla,The dry husk of ancient creatures that speak to us like we should trust them on current issues.
10424,2020-08-20 01:59:14,iczcla,Oh britta`s in this?
10425,2020-08-20 02:01:49,iczcla,"""Bing bong! sing along! Your team's Al Gore cause your views are wrong."""

10435,2020-08-20 02:05:24,iczcla,They legit saved the best for last.
10436,2020-08-20 02:14:55,iczcla,Great! Very real and authentic
10437,2020-08-20 02:33:47,iczcla,The director chose the wrong time to get all artsy
10438,2020-08-20 03:06:26,iczcla,Everyone is doing that. I think that’s the DNC’s feed.
10439,2020-08-20 03:07:31,iczcla,The networks are doing that too. It's just the DNC feed I would imagine.
10440,2020-08-20 03:07:00,iczcla,Idk I had to change to a different broadcast bc it was weird
10441,2020-08-20 03:05:33,iczcla,"She doesn't need to come across as an orator, just as ready to take over on day 1. I think she's doing great honestly."
10442,2020-08-20 04:13:04,iczcla,"The [official schedule](https://www.demconvention.com/schedule-and-speakers/?_sft_event-day=august-19) actually had Barack going last, so maybe it was a last minute change?"
10443,2020-08-20 03:07:05,iczcla,"It's debatable.

If Obama had gone after Kamala and done just as well he might have stolen the show or made her moment pale in comparison."
10444,2020-08-20 03:10:15,iczcla,You can't exactly have the former president speak before the nominee for VP. That would completely undermine Kamala in the worst way.
10445,2020-08-20 00:33:45,iczcla,Basically unemployment going up in swing states and states that went to Trump in ‘16
10446,2020-08-20 00:20:35,iczcla,Just like MSNBC's Kornacki
10447,2020-08-20 00:38:21,iczcla,"whoa, the disrespect.  Do not ever put Tapper in the same sentence as John King."
10448,2020-08-20 02:51:56,iczcla,Jake Tapper is way better than John King IMO. But he's an Eagles fan so I'm biased
10449,2020-08-20 00:23:28,iczcla,"I would pay good money, I don't have, to watch Tapper interview Trump."
10450,2020-08-20 01:22:46,iczcla,Doesn’t mean we can stop.
10451,2020-08-20 01:23:35,iczcla,"It's about avoiding billions dead at this point, but rather making it millions"
10452,2020-08-20 01:24:22,iczcla,But but but they'll run COMMERCIALS that are pro climate. I'm sure everything will be fine. lol.

10456,2020-08-20 02:06:42,iczcla,Dating a republican?
10457,2020-08-20 02:42:42,iczcla,"We got a big baby in a diaper, close enough?"
10458,2020-08-20 02:42:43,iczcla,So you never tune into Trump’s press rants?
10459,2020-08-20 02:51:50,iczcla,Still a better VP than Pence.
10460,2020-08-20 02:50:58,iczcla,CNBC is fucking it up
10461,2020-08-20 02:51:06,iczcla,"No, I have a video playing. Where are you watching"
10462,2020-08-20 02:51:07,iczcla,Yep. Blank for like 4 minutes or so.
10463,2020-08-20 02:51:19,iczcla,"yeah, CNBC? I can't tell if theyre messing up or the DNC is"
10464,2020-08-20 03:39:43,iczcla,He’s got the demon sperm doctor lined up to speak.
10465,2020-08-20 03:44:09,iczcla,"Hannity, Ingram, Pirro, Tucker. Probably"
10466,2020-08-20 03:48:11,iczcla,I hope he does. He has already endorsed her and praised her. I want that to not be forgotten easily.
10467,2020-08-20 07:47:41,iczcla,Exactly. Their coverage is confusing. In the middle of the convention wolf interrupted and they started showing weather and some ads
10468,2020-08-20 03:13:51,iczcla,She didn’t have much choice. Her job was to not scare away moderate white people in the Midwest and she did that job well.
10469,2020-08-20 03:12:51,iczcla,She doesn't need to coached. She has been in politics for years
10470,2020-08-20 01:32:48,iczcla,Zoomers are late-teens early-20s right now.
10471,2020-08-20 01:32:13,iczcla,Eh. I like her stuff and I’m a 28 year old woman. Also Billie is 18. Her peers is the newest voters.
10472,2020-08-20 01:31:48,iczcla,"No, lots of fans around 18 years old. This is great for the youth vote."
10473,2020-08-20 01:32:25,iczcla,"Nah, the core demo is late highs school and early college, most of which can vote."
10474,2020-08-20 01:33:02,iczcla,Get the oldest of the zoomers (who are 17 or 18+) active
10475,2020-08-20 01:34:13,iczcla,Well Joe Biden isn't super popular with the youths so they had to do something
10476,2020-08-20 01:33:15,iczcla,"A lot of her fan base is younger, but she’s wildly popular with the 18-21 demographic as well."
10477,2020-08-20 01:33:53,iczcla,She's huge with the late high school into college age group. The earliest voters!
10478,2020-08-20 01:35:45,iczcla,18 yr olds can vote. Her fan base is bigger than you think. 18 yr olds need to vote.
10479,2020-08-20 01:42:55,iczcla,She's big with the college aged crowd.
10480,2020-08-20 01:32:43,iczcla,"Of course, why try to appeal to teenagers, or people from Texas? Or even people who live here who can’t vote?

It amazes me how much people have forgotten what a political party that serves people who live in America looks like."
10481,2020-08-20 01:45:39,iczcla,Former Police Chief might have been a bad idea.
10482,2020-08-20 01:46:46,iczcla,"I loved her resume, but I think I read that she had some troubling stuff from her police days when they were vetting her."
10483,2020-08-20 01:45:58,iczcla,Same. And not just because I had bet $50 on her with 20:1 odds.
10484,2020-08-20 02:02:59,iczcla,Ridiculously underrated.
10485,2020-08-20 02:03:32,iczcla,Thank you
10486,2020-08-20 02:35:16,iczcla,Really good and unifying. Isn't all about trump it's mostly about Biden.
10487,2020-08-20 02:35:47,iczcla,That was some pretty quick lovin’
10488,2020-08-20 02:35:49,iczcla,Perfect score 5/7
10489,2020-08-20 04:42:09,iczcla,Watch it. It’s a total uppercut.
10490,2020-08-20 04:42:32,iczcla,"To be honest with you imo his delivery was on point, it’s also never been his style to attack so it was completely out of character and refreshing at the same time to see him go at trump so eloquently.  Obama will always appeal to the higher thinking people because he’s not a get in the mud and fight dirty guy, he’ll take the high road always.  What I did expect was Kamala to be more aggressive in attacking trump and being a former prosecutor I expected a little more.  She’s got time though and I expect to see her very active leading up to the election."
10491,2020-08-20 05:00:15,iczcla,"I mean, you should probably watch it before making claims. I found it to be an uppercut (that caused trump tweet out)"
10492,2020-08-20 04:46:30,iczcla,Watch the speech - the delivery puts everything together
10493,2020-08-20 02:51:16,iczcla,[deleted]
10494,2020-08-20 02:51:52,iczcla,I’m for ice in my gin and tonic.
10495,2020-08-20 05:16:15,iczcla,Have u  looked at Biden's proposed policies?
10496,2020-08-20 05:20:08,iczcla,Duuuude why?  It’s a great ticket. The policies are there for sure.
10497,2020-08-20 09:27:19,iczcla,"""The DNC"" didn't choose, voters did."
10498,2020-08-20 01:07:14,iczcla,Kerry
10499,2020-08-20 01:12:12,iczcla,Is she speaking tonight? I’m not in the state anymore but I was happy to vote for her and flip the 6th a couple years ago!
10500,2020-08-20 01:22:27,iczcla,There are speeches in this hour but the main ones (eg; Obama & Harris) will be in the 10pm ET hour
10501,2020-08-20 01:39:25,iczcla,Billie Eillish
10502,2020-08-20 01:40:58,iczcla,Gabby Giffords
10503,2020-08-20 01:41:37,iczcla,I watched Day 2 on YouTube / cspan
10504,2020-08-20 01:47:11,iczcla,CSPAN stream is where it's at. I've  been watching it there every day
10505,2020-08-20 01:55:53,iczcla,Nope
10506,2020-08-20 02:19:33,iczcla,"You're damn right! And he's brought PILLOWS!

But not for free, he's not a \**GASP*\* *commie!*"
10507,2020-08-20 02:19:48,iczcla,I feel bad we unleashed that crackhead on the world
10508,2020-08-20 02:22:57,iczcla,Puts you on the Biden campaign voter contact list.
10509,2020-08-20 02:23:16,iczcla,Sends you a link to voting info for your zip code
10510,2020-08-20 02:28:45,iczcla,Por la gracia de Dios
10511,2020-08-20 03:12:59,iczcla,"Obama, who usually doesn’t mention his name, directly sent shots as Trump watched."
10512,2020-08-20 03:13:16,iczcla,Obama. He finally dropped the kid gloves.
10513,2020-08-20 03:20:45,iczcla,Once you hear Obama speak you will know who and why.
10514,2020-08-20 03:15:04,iczcla,They’ll pack their convention center ass to ankles.
10515,2020-08-20 03:15:53,iczcla,Find it and watch it.
10516,2020-08-20 03:17:53,iczcla,"It was a humdinger, watch it."
10517,2020-08-20 03:20:34,iczcla,Go to YouTube.
10518,2020-08-20 02:03:09,iczcla,"She wants to punch back*


*for the children"
10519,2020-08-20 02:02:49,iczcla,Dentures snagged her jaw or something
10520,2020-08-20 02:13:40,iczcla,Small business owners vote too
10521,2020-08-20 02:14:10,iczcla,"Small business owner checking in, we got hammered due to COVID. This segment matters."
10522,2020-08-20 02:18:07,iczcla,He handled that horribly.
10523,2020-08-20 04:16:02,iczcla,Two edged sword really. Can't have a second encore of the best but definitely will help prevent the worst.
10524,2020-08-20 15:57:40,iczcla,"It's important that getting rid of the current regime allows Congress to put safeguards in place.  We are lucky that it's a dumb authoritarian, because we can now prevent future ones from happening."
10525,2020-08-20 16:54:30,iczcla,"The DNC tried to pretend that the election was in the bag in 2016 and was all forward looking past the election then. If it makes you feel better we could go back to those plans.

Winning elections is hard, even against Trump. All the future plans are useless if he wins and then demolishes everything. You can't pass safeguards against authoritarians if the authoritarian is still in power!"
10526,2020-08-20 18:40:16,iczcla,"you're not the only one. they're literally rubbing in our face that they're full on Republicans now. Lesser of 2 evils is still evil, and the next evil is always going to be worse.THere hasn't been single damage control since Ronald Reagan. George H. W. Bush was the last president that raised minimum wage while Bill Clinton tried to sell social security to Blackstone Equity with DLC (Joe Biden leading in 1999)"
10527,2020-08-20 01:52:10,iczcla,She's doing great. This is a great appearance.
10528,2020-08-20 12:30:20,iczcla,Sorry today's sermon is so long; I didn't have time to write a short one.
10529,2020-08-20 05:54:45,iczcla,"It's a Trafalgar Group poll, a C- pollster on 538 with a R lean."
10530,2020-08-20 05:55:42,iczcla,All the polls I see have Biden with a 5+ lead in MN
10531,2020-08-20 09:46:35,iczcla,"Ahh. the old chestnut of Trump winning Minnesota.  Put it this way.  In 2016, Hillary had 180,000 LESS votes than Obama in 2012 and Trump had about 2000 more than Romney did.  And Hillary still won Minnesota.  Those 180,000 voters aren't staying home this time."
10532,2020-08-20 06:03:33,iczcla,The Harris bump
10533,2020-08-20 05:49:07,iczcla,Things usually tighten up as you get closer to Election Day.
10534,2020-08-20 10:20:48,iczcla,Absolutely. People voted in 2016 with the message of being sick of the establishment and the status quo. The democrats response is to put a status quo and establishment candidate forward for president. Trump will get less votes than the last election the problem is that a lot of people will simply stay home rather than vote for Biden
10535,2020-08-20 01:23:48,iczcla,They literally just told you. Lol.
10536,2020-08-20 01:23:28,iczcla,"Full details on live TV is for nerds. You're gonna have to read, sport"
10537,2020-08-20 01:23:47,iczcla,Bernie talked about them on day 1.  Schumer discussed some yesterday. Biden will discuss them tomorrow.
10538,2020-08-20 01:26:17,iczcla,Sad truth is most people tune out when they talk about policy
10539,2020-08-20 03:16:26,iczcla,"You can read the full details of Biden's concrete policies on his website. I appreciate that they are using this time to showcase the moral and emotional aspects of this election, and that I can find all the details myself with a little bit of work."
10540,2020-08-20 01:50:25,iczcla,In 2016 they were.
10541,2020-08-20 01:52:25,iczcla,"It's 2020, people who are just getting to vote this year weren't alive for the Clinton presidency. Hell, I remember nothing from the Clinton Presidency, the first president I remember was Dubya."
10542,2020-08-20 04:19:32,iczcla,It's important to know where you've been in order to remember which way you want to go. If anything else they give positive points of comparison for the younger crowd.
10543,2020-08-20 02:54:19,iczcla,Obama once called her the best looking AG in the nation.
10544,2020-08-20 02:54:26,iczcla,agreed
10545,2020-08-20 03:09:53,iczcla,"Access has _never_ been the problem.

Affordability has."
10546,2020-08-20 03:18:32,iczcla,"AOC is given way too much importance, both by the left and the right. She has much to learn. She has the makings of a great politician, but let's not jump the gun."
10547,2020-08-20 03:19:52,iczcla,"I’m a progressive and a lifelong Democrat. I thought that the climate ad with Joe was really well done.

AOC is a bit too polarizing for the older crowd and not to mention much too junior."
10548,2020-08-20 01:02:39,iczcla,"This tent doesn't need to be that much bigger...just more moderates and even more liberals. 

remember, these people still think abortion is murder and guns are Jesus."
10549,2020-08-20 01:07:58,iczcla,Biden 2020: Sock Trump!
10550,2020-08-20 02:25:02,iczcla,Okay.
10551,2020-08-20 02:51:36,iczcla,Obama had ISIS on the ropes. Trump just finished (and then unfinished) the job
10552,2020-08-20 02:52:19,iczcla,Trump let a ton of ISIS leaders escape prison when he took our troops out of syria
10553,2020-08-20 02:51:45,iczcla,Feels like forever ago. Was ISIS even a thing under Obama?
10554,2020-08-20 02:52:50,iczcla,"Sarah Sanders said it, so it’s probably a blatant lie."
10555,2020-08-20 02:53:32,iczcla,Trump stabbed our longtime allies against isis (the Kurds) in the back and left them to die In order to kiss Erdogan’s ass during a casual phone call.
10556,2020-08-20 02:53:59,iczcla,It’s right up there with trump saying Obama left him with a mess. Like seriously? Obama was left with a fucking mess and he left trump with the presidency on easy mode. But trump who ruins everything he touches fucked his own presidency up.
10557,2020-08-20 02:52:42,iczcla,"I mean, ISIS is still active, so I think that one's debunk-able with a quick Google search."
10558,2020-08-20 02:54:09,iczcla,You don't really need a fact-check for that. That's just a ridiculous claim among HUNDREDS by him.
10559,2020-08-20 02:55:19,iczcla,"It’s a mixed thing. They were nearing the peak of their power right at the end of the Obama presidency / right as trump was coming into office, but they were suffering heavily. The issue is we didn’t have troops on the ground in large quantities. So our ability to stop them was building, and Obama’s actions would have done it. But it would’ve taken time."
10560,2020-08-20 01:53:25,iczcla,Mexico will pay for the wall any day now...
10561,2020-08-20 01:53:32,iczcla,I lol’d
10562,2020-08-20 01:53:58,iczcla,Not gonna lie you had me in the first half
10563,2020-08-20 01:54:01,iczcla,"> As a Trump supporter I don't understand why this lady is allowed to talk.

This quote kind of speaks for itself tbh.

Edit: god damn it you got me."
10564,2020-08-20 01:54:15,iczcla,Ya had me for a hot second.
10565,2020-08-20 02:11:08,iczcla,It’s crazy how many people read the first four words of your comment and immediately stopped reading and hit reply.
10566,2020-08-20 01:55:33,iczcla,[deleted]
10567,2020-08-20 01:53:41,iczcla,Forgot to include /s?
10568,2020-08-20 01:54:43,iczcla,[deleted]
10569,2020-08-20 01:11:38,iczcla,Yea that's what a convention is
10570,2020-08-20 01:11:12,iczcla,That's what conventions are...
10571,2020-08-20 01:11:27,iczcla,It's tradition. It's for getting out the vote and getting democrats to volunteer and donate time and money.
10572,2020-08-20 01:12:08,iczcla,"Most won't watch, some will, more will see highlights from whatever news outlet they read or watch, likely focusing on quick soundbites or small supposed errors."
10573,2020-08-20 01:14:29,iczcla,"Yeah people try to make the argument that undecideds or republicans watch this but unless you're really into politics and watch because you like it. It only serves to energize your base. Maybe a clip or a headline catches national attention, but circlejerk is a good name for it"
10574,2020-08-20 01:11:02,iczcla,They aren’t but independents might be.
10575,2020-08-20 01:12:37,iczcla,"Most of the ones I have seen participating in these threads are either making jokes or saying the convention is ""too sad"" to build positive voting energy or to sway them (which also sounds pretty disingenuous)."
10576,2020-08-20 01:15:05,iczcla,"It is designed that way a little bit, it is the democratic convention so it makes sense that they want to celebrate democrats and highlight the differences between the parties."
10577,2020-08-20 01:46:33,iczcla,"I'm voting Republican in 2020 and I've watched each night. I agree with your assessment, although conventions are basically just big rallies, so that's expected.


I'm watching because it reminds me what I'm voting for/against."
10578,2020-08-20 02:49:32,iczcla,Nephew.
10579,2020-08-20 02:50:14,iczcla,*Bonk*
10580,2020-08-20 03:35:24,iczcla,Honestly I thought it was her strongest speech ever. Idk if that is because I'm a woman and she really spoke to that experience.
10581,2020-08-20 03:34:20,iczcla,Obama is a tough act to follow
10582,2020-08-20 03:36:36,iczcla,Obama just gave the first Oval Office address to the whole country in 4 years.
10583,2020-08-20 03:35:22,iczcla,"Jake Tapper was like, ""Okay Wolf, I'll get to that in a second, but lets talk about Kamala first."""
10584,2020-08-20 04:13:24,iczcla,"I just watched

Yeah Obama destroyed any chance of me listening Kamala.  Oof man, that was some powerful shit Obama...

Kamala by comparison was a snooze.  Just unfortunate"
10585,2020-08-20 00:34:04,iczcla,"Hey now!  The man has congenital resting bitch face, it is not cool to attack him for a physical challenge he was born with."
10586,2020-08-20 02:19:00,iczcla,"Sabes que hablo inglés, verdad?"
10587,2020-08-20 01:30:22,iczcla,She always dresses like that
10588,2020-08-20 01:30:28,iczcla,It’s kind of her thing. Wants the focus on her music not her body...crazy right?
10589,2020-08-20 01:30:26,iczcla,She apparently wears baggy clothing to keep herself from being sexualized by the media.
10590,2020-08-20 02:59:25,iczcla,It’s sad because it truly was an accomplishment to have the biggest show on tv be about a black family
10591,2020-08-20 02:59:59,iczcla,Amen!
10592,2020-08-20 01:31:15,iczcla,It's always like this. Just more apparent cause it's virtual
10593,2020-08-20 01:32:04,iczcla,"You know if they made it a genuine variety show they'd get banging ratings, I'd watch that shit.  

>""And now Bernie Sanders on the harmonica!"""
10594,2020-08-20 01:10:35,iczcla,"I thought the nominating roll call was more to ensure delegates would be appropriately distributed so Sanders, his team, and supporters, felt represented during the actual business of the convention. It was about progressives feeling connected by not having to cede their delegates. 

It’s why they jointly, Biden and Sanders, worked to keep Sanders on the ballot even after it was clear Sanders wouldn’t get the votes for the nomination.

Edit: here’s a [good source](https://heavy.com/news/2020/08/why-bernie-sanders-on-democratic-convention-dnc-ballot/) to get the full picture"
10595,2020-08-20 01:16:03,iczcla,Probably to keep her above it and on message.
10596,2020-08-20 01:17:20,iczcla,No need to
10597,2020-08-20 01:23:08,iczcla,Yeah most people do now
10598,2020-08-20 01:33:41,iczcla,That's coming next week.
10599,2020-08-20 01:42:25,iczcla,And where's the goofy neighbor coming in without knocking?
10600,2020-08-20 01:44:57,iczcla,Bah gawd is that Nancy’s music???
10601,2020-08-20 01:46:01,iczcla,All you can eat buffets don't pay for themselves.
10602,2020-08-20 01:45:12,iczcla,He’s gotta pay for his next meal somehow
10603,2020-08-20 01:45:23,iczcla,I think that’s literally his job.
10604,2020-08-20 01:50:06,iczcla,Yup!
10605,2020-08-20 01:52:52,iczcla,"I have my headphones on and keep hearing weird static or something, like somebody is rubbing against plastic or rubbing the mic."

10607,2020-08-20 01:52:01,iczcla,Press f5 in your stremaming page
10608,2020-08-20 02:46:33,iczcla,He already did and gave president biff the sports almanac
10609,2020-08-20 03:16:56,iczcla,Only if you got hard liquor ready to go
10610,2020-08-20 03:17:46,iczcla,Depends. How much alcohol do you have ?
10611,2020-08-20 03:16:39,iczcla,Why?
10612,2020-08-20 02:02:08,iczcla,I mean she is 80
10613,2020-08-20 03:17:28,iczcla,Clinton and Al Gore are younger than Biden.
10614,2020-08-20 04:39:58,iczcla,"more likely in the first term, lets be real"
10615,2020-08-20 05:30:20,iczcla,"i'm not sure if we have a democratic candidate in 2024 if it'll be Biden or Harris.

And in all likelihood Harris will take over well before a 2nd term."
10616,2020-08-20 03:14:43,iczcla,"Which, to be fair, Obama is such a talented orator that you could say that about most talented orators lol."
10617,2020-08-20 03:13:39,iczcla,That’s not really fair. I would definitely hate to go after him even if I was a good public speaker.
10618,2020-08-20 03:13:58,iczcla,"I mean, who could be?"
10619,2020-08-20 03:14:42,iczcla,Thank God. She's better
10620,2020-08-20 03:13:50,iczcla,One of the shots showed a few people socially distanced.
10621,2020-08-20 03:13:34,iczcla,there's a few people out in the seats
10622,2020-08-20 03:15:18,iczcla,"Their staff is probably out in the socially distant crowd

But yes it was quite awkward looking lol"
10623,2020-08-20 03:13:24,iczcla,There are people in the audience.
10624,2020-08-20 03:13:41,iczcla,Were you not tuned in to the DNC feed? There's like 10 people.
10625,2020-08-20 03:13:24,iczcla,Cameras in what looks to be a press booth.
10626,2020-08-20 02:19:14,iczcla,"Well that’s not fair, she was never asked to!   /s"
10627,2020-08-20 03:14:56,iczcla,It's about setting an example for the public
10628,2020-08-20 03:14:54,iczcla,Seems a simple way to reduce Joe's risk in a large space. Would be silly to have them close.
10629,2020-08-20 03:15:30,iczcla,...that's kind of the biggest issue that this election is about.
10630,2020-08-20 03:17:01,iczcla,They’re surely being tested all the time - it’s to set an example for other people.
10631,2020-08-20 03:19:04,iczcla,In this pandemic? Not a good look.
10632,2020-08-20 03:23:56,iczcla,Would that be a problem for you?
10633,2020-08-20 03:23:11,iczcla,"I didn't catch the earlier days, did they have other religious priests say prayers on day 1 and 2?"
10634,2020-08-20 03:32:19,iczcla,They've had different denominations represented at the start(?) and end of every night so far.
10635,2020-08-20 03:25:42,iczcla,"You didn’t like this:


“We will tell them not just what we felt, we will tell them what we did” — bravo to her speech writers"
10636,2020-08-20 03:27:42,iczcla,I'd argue the party was trying to show the new people who she is outside of the harsh prosecutor persona. Obama was the fierce speaker and it was set up that way purposefully.
10637,2020-08-19 23:53:49,iczcla,Oh definitely. I'm sitting here like it's the Oscar's waiting for all the democratic shade.
10638,2020-08-20 03:12:53,iczcla,Democracy by Zoom
10639,2020-08-20 01:27:43,iczcla,That auto correct though.
10640,2020-08-20 02:08:42,iczcla,"That is not what a carburetor is, unfortunately.

Is this satire?"
10641,2020-08-20 01:30:17,iczcla,I like how you say that like it’s an insult.
10642,2020-08-20 01:30:23,iczcla,Not really even close
10643,2020-08-20 01:03:21,iczcla,"Not really. It's like a backstage thing, as if she's getting ready for later"
10644,2020-08-20 01:03:06,iczcla,What? Kamala speaking? It wasn't.
10645,2020-08-20 01:02:26,iczcla,What video?
10646,2020-08-20 01:47:59,iczcla,I can't relate to anyone with such exquisite bone structure. My face looks like misshapen play doh.
10647,2020-08-20 01:46:51,iczcla,By not being an asshole?
10648,2020-08-20 02:15:03,iczcla,Cool. Go drop a deuce.
10649,2020-08-20 02:15:27,iczcla,"Just pinch it and save it, friend! You can go in like 45 minutes!"
10650,2020-08-20 01:36:12,iczcla,"-or-

We heard you, now lets get this done."
10651,2020-08-20 01:38:38,iczcla,"More like “we know the last two nights we’re not your cup of tea, so we present night 3”"
10652,2020-08-20 01:37:25,iczcla,Boo to you
10653,2020-08-20 01:41:18,iczcla,"I know, that phrase always makes me think of when Native Americans came to North America, but that was, what, 20,000 years ago. That's a pretty long time! And if you want to go back really far then we all come from Africa anyway"
10654,2020-08-20 01:52:40,iczcla,It's supposed to. It's a convention for party supporters.
10655,2020-08-20 02:15:11,iczcla,Lol 😂
10656,2020-08-20 02:56:09,iczcla,I'm Guessing They Want Her And Joe To Be Seen With Each Other Either Tonight Or Tomorrow For Some Photo Ops.
10657,2020-08-20 03:01:24,iczcla,Probably for photo ops with Biden and not wanting to travel as much.
10658,2020-08-20 02:55:01,iczcla,Maybe in case the senate gets called back
10659,2020-08-20 02:55:22,iczcla,Could be working out some things with Biden
10660,2020-08-20 07:42:21,iczcla,Not that difficult considering how much of an asshole he is 🤷‍♂️
10661,2020-08-20 06:33:08,iczcla,"To be fair, he is handing them all the arguments"
10662,2020-08-20 06:50:50,iczcla,"If you could go ahead and give me some legit positive talking points I will absolutely pass them on.  I tend to go deaf after Draft Dodger, Rapist, and Pedophile.  You know, things we knew before the election."
10663,2020-08-20 09:12:13,iczcla,And the only critique of their claims he could make was that *more* people had died because if his incompetence than they said.
10664,2020-08-20 15:04:17,iczcla,"They really haven’t, though. All I keep hearing is “trump bad,” there’s little to no reason provided to vote for Biden besides “well, he’s certainly not Trump!” They tried that in 2016, and gosh, how did that election end up..."
10665,2020-08-20 02:04:30,iczcla,"Hey, it could be worse, you could be forced to see her name on a street sign on your morning run every morning, but don't let that stop you from voting!"
10666,2020-08-20 02:06:15,iczcla,I understand her better now. Having five kids in six years explains a lot.
10667,2020-08-20 01:39:04,iczcla,It was also awkward how they were blatantly reading a script honestly.
10668,2020-08-20 01:44:29,iczcla,And?
10669,2020-08-20 02:25:39,iczcla,It just rolls off the tongue.
10670,2020-08-20 01:45:05,iczcla,"Watch the DNC stream on youtube, no commentators. :)"
10671,2020-08-20 02:18:01,iczcla,owners of course
10672,2020-08-20 01:19:37,iczcla,I liked Tracy Ellis Ross. She was fantastic.
10673,2020-08-20 01:18:23,iczcla,"I even like her as an actress, but the Beetlejuice-esque pantsuit is distracting."
10674,2020-08-20 01:30:48,iczcla,"Yeah, you're right. They should just stop trying to reach as many people as possible and give up on a huge demographic."
10675,2020-08-20 01:30:11,iczcla,"Eh not true, the young came out and voted in the midterms 2018. I think we'll see a mobilised youth this time around too, but feel free to hold me to my word in 70 days or so"
10676,2020-08-20 01:56:02,iczcla,"Bernie is a national treasure! I think he will continue to give Biden guidance, if Biden wins."
10677,2020-08-20 01:55:16,iczcla,He’s finished. Shouldn’t even be mentioned at this point. Biden 2020.
10678,2020-08-20 03:04:58,iczcla,No refunds lol.
10679,2020-08-20 03:10:28,iczcla,Maybe it's a reminder that the room wouldn't be so empty if trump hadn't fucked up so bad.
10680,2020-08-20 03:23:18,iczcla,We can’t all be perfect
10681,2020-08-20 01:38:18,iczcla,"Here's [his immigration plan.](https://joebiden.com/immigration/) He supports Dreamers, of course, and also a path to citizenship for other undocumented immigrants. Like Obama, he would focus deportations on convicted felons."
10682,2020-08-20 01:39:12,iczcla,"Well considering DACA was Obama’s relatively lasting hold over after the GOP house wouldn’t pass the immigration bill that made it through the senate, I’d say Biden will one up that. That’s how it works. And while Obama enforced deportations, that was done far more humanely than Trump."
10683,2020-08-20 01:38:23,iczcla,"Yes, he's going to end the family separation and is going to end deportation of all undocumented immigrants who aren't felons"
10684,2020-08-20 01:41:00,iczcla,Yes
10685,2020-08-20 01:41:04,iczcla,"Yes Obama was the deporter in chief but Trump literally separates children from their parents. There is a big difference. 

Congress and Obama admin also fostered DACA. Most democrats want to change immigration laws. 

Do you know how incredibly hard it is to become a US citizen? Almost impossible. You can’t do Ellis island like my moms ancestors. You can’t do wet/foot dry foot like my Cuban coworkers. You can’t come in a work visa as a chef with no skills like my husbands uncle. It is fucking hard and takes years and $$$."

10688,2020-08-20 01:50:29,iczcla,Pretty sure the Russians had something to do with it
10689,2020-08-20 01:51:10,iczcla,Except for all those Republicans who lost in the primaries.
10690,2020-08-20 01:51:08,iczcla,"Pretty messed up that some people have such a problem with women speaking like this

She wasn't awful at all, America just went insane and made the wrong choice. We'd have avoided so many issues if she was president now. Maybe people should learn from that mistake"
10691,2020-08-20 01:58:30,iczcla,No one ever tells gore or Kerry to go away. I wonder why
10692,2020-08-20 13:54:46,iczcla,But this is who she is. She smiled a lot on the campaign trail.
10693,2020-08-20 13:57:58,iczcla,"No she just smiles alot. 

That hasn't changed. I think this might be one of the few times that they haven't pushed overly fake persona's on people."
10694,2020-08-20 14:51:49,iczcla,"Yeah, make them scared like all the teens she locked up for weed!"
10695,2020-08-20 14:07:59,iczcla,"I disagree, we want to see the smiles and laughs of someone who puts people away for marijuana while smoking it herself and bragging about it.   We want to see someone smile and laugh about fucking her way into her positions.   

She won’t be smiling when she has to make a decision at the presidential level here in about six months when Biden vacates the office due to mental issues."
10696,2020-08-20 01:52:48,iczcla,"She atleast gives speeches, compared to doturd drump"

Isn’t that a way that America has treated them in a specific way?"
10699,2020-08-20 04:35:30,iczcla,"There are less options for medical access in predominantly black neighborhoods. Systemic racism makes it difficult for black people to get access to medical care. Get access to testing, to treatment. In a non pandemic world, the odds weren’t great. But now, they are exacerbated. The link with police brutality is that systemic racism affects all aspects of living."

10712,2020-08-20 06:51:16,iczcla,Your error is thinking an election against an authoritarian strongman (during a time of extreme wealth inequality and polarization in this country and around the world) should be a “slam dunk.”
10713,2020-08-20 05:18:38,iczcla,"What more can dems do? Bring out Michelle and Barack to give passionate speeches. Nominated the most popular nominee (I’m a Bernie supporter but he didn’t get more votes. End of story). Spend money. Get on camera. What more can be done to raise the flag. 

If they loose, it won’t be because they didn’t eat at the right fucking counter, it’ll be because lazy and apathetic people can’t be bothered to register to vote and show the fuck up. And because people believe it’s funny to piss of suffering people in the name of owning and winning some stupid ass culture war."

Vanilla Ice had some talent. There was absolutely no denying that. But he was a jackass. Utterly lacking in humility and respect. He could not take constructive criticism to save his life. He lost in the third round, came back using one of the side shows, and then lost again one round before the finale.

In this analogy Trump is the Vanilla Ice--a guy with some pathetic talent that drops out due to arrogance and his own stupidity."

10831,2020-08-20 05:26:02,iczcla,"Wtf are you talking about? 

Voters overwhelmingly voted for joe in the primary. It was very far from a close primary. Are you saying the democrats should have rejected the voters wishes and instead nominate someone who has performed terribly with key swing states in the primary? Performing even worse than he did 4 years ago? 


What's fucking sad is how people keep saying the DNC should reject democracy and screw over average voters just because they don't like the nominee. Biden is far from my first choice but I am certainly not going say millions of voters should not be listened to just cause I'm not happy."
10832,2020-08-20 05:39:29,iczcla,"In both primaries, progressives couldn't be bothered to get off their ass and vote, so their candidate lost.  
  
Fucking sad, but actually true.  
  
Do I think Bernie could have beaten Trump? Absolutely.  
  
Unfortunately, memes aren't votes and it turns out you have to actually give a shit if you want your guy to win."
10833,2020-08-20 05:21:24,iczcla,Stop. Progressives proved in 2016 and 2020 that they are not turning out to vote/not a popular enough ideology to win the primary. If the progressive wing on the democratic party wants to keep demonizing the moderate candidates that only serves to harm the party as a whole and elect more Republicans like Trump that will in fact set the progressive movement back for GENERATIONS.

A thing I don’t like about her choices is not prosecuting Mnuchin’s bank during the housing crisis, while they foreclosed on people for cents on the dollar, **but, she has done an about face on a lot of issues, and has a pretty good record of standing up for progressive ideas, with writing bills and arguing in the senate.**

She was a prosecutor. I have plenty of problems with her record there, but she wasn't a cop. I don't get why this meme is so popular."
10879,2020-08-20 02:59:58,iczcla,"Check out her voting record afterward. She was anti-weed when weed was illegal because her job was to enforce the law. Ultimately, because America is racist and sexist, she cannot be an activist as an Attorney General (or whatever the exact title was) because they would just recall her or something. It's not great for sure, but we have to acknowledge change. She is one of the few Senators who did author one of the best Marijuana legalization bills, federally.

It's hard to say ""Well, she's better now,"" but that's how every single person lives. I am better than I was in my teens and twenties as I sit well in my thirties. She is using her experience to make amends for her past and pushing things in a better direction where the law of the land won't jail people for being too poor to send kids to school or needing an escape like weed."
10880,2020-08-20 04:59:08,iczcla,The recession started before Covid.  Farmers were going bankrupt in record number and Manufacturing was already in a deep recession because of Trump.  Economists were already predicting a full recession before Covid ever entered the picture.  Trump's handling of Covid just made things 100 times worse than it would have been with someone competent in charge.
10881,2020-08-20 05:07:46,iczcla,"It's kinda infuriating to imagine that there are actually people that think we'd be in a better position dealing with the pandemic if we'd never shut down.

Case numbers and the death toll would be significantly higher if we'd followed all of what he wanted, and the reasons they aren't lower than they are now are mostly tied to him and his party's resist the the steps that were taken."
10882,2020-08-20 04:59:48,iczcla,trump destroyed the pandemic response framework started under George W and expanded under Obama/Biden. Think about that. trump cut also cut funding to research and to a program we had working with the Chinese government to stop pandemics. It should have never come to this.
10883,2020-08-20 05:58:24,iczcla,Him trying to force the economy to stay open and people going back to normal too early is the reason the economy is in such sad shape right now
10884,2020-08-20 04:55:16,iczcla,If we had an actual plan we could safely reopen by now. Whenever we try to force reopening it doesn’t work. 2+2=4.

Also, you think that Republicans wouldn't be throwing blame around if it was a (D) in the WH? Not a chance. trump owns every part of the shutdown and his inept pandemic response."
10886,2020-08-20 04:56:54,iczcla,"Re-opening the economy doesn’t magically make the jobs come back. Nor does it magically kill the coronavirus. 

See current states: Florida, Georgia, Texas"
10887,2020-08-20 04:59:07,iczcla,"The economic impact is proportional to the scope of the problem, which was pretty clearly exacerbated by his personal failures.  Job losses and downturn are a fundementally product of the pandemic, lockdowns were also a product of the pandemic.  His failure to lead made both problems worse."
10888,2020-08-20 05:11:17,iczcla,"Then those people aren’t paying attention. 

We squandered all the money we spent on stimulus and crutching businesses because we had an ineffective, weak mitigation strategy (OPEN UP THE STATES AND ALSO FUCK MASKS). 

That complete lack of strategy and leadership is directly at the feet of trump. 

If we’d had it, it would’ve stung and we’d be well on our way back. Instead we’re all flopping around like a fish on the dock."
10889,2020-08-20 05:21:29,iczcla,"What you say is not really accurate. 

The reason they blame trump is because he failed so badly at dealing with the pandemic it has caused the recession to be much worse than it is. 

Him trying to reopen things has made the economy worse. 

What all the economists and experts had said is that if he hadnt refused to allow lockdowns to happen early on and if he didn't push red states to reopened to soon we actually would have lost much less jobs and lives. 

By prolonging this the economy is much worse off. While other countries who were originally hit much worse than us are going back to normal with more open businesses and a slowly rebounding economy. The US is dealing with increased deaths and talk of shutting down again. 

By every metric trump has made this worse which has made the job losses much much worse than they needed to be."
10890,2020-08-20 05:32:44,iczcla,"Okay, but him fucking up the response to COVID is what makes the continued lockdown necessary. Him being ""against"" lockdown actively prolonged it."
10891,2020-08-20 04:57:55,iczcla,an open economy cannot exist when there is  a raging pandemic.
10892,2020-08-20 05:31:16,iczcla,"True. You can make any argument you want. 

But the truth is NOBODY knows what could have been, and the response has to balance the pandemic with the economy. 

It's hard to convince people on the fence Trump did everything wrong. Even though he did."

10944,2020-08-20 02:14:40,iczcla,"> how much support they will gain from moderates versus how much support they will lose from leftists.

Do you think the convention is losing leftists? If so, why?"
10945,2020-08-20 02:16:18,iczcla,"None, obviously presidential campaigns are just witch doctors throwing darts or something for strategy. 

Everything has been tested and considered, sometimes mistakes are made, sometimes assumptions are wrong, but ultimately everything they put out had some sort of logical analysis that had been done beforehand."

So-called “leftists” didn’t show up for Bernie, so why waste resources catering to their constantly shifting goalposts. 

Progress happens in steps. Progress is different than revolution, and understanding that, is key to moving forward."
10949,2020-08-20 01:29:32,iczcla,The campaign is pushing that Biden is willing to listen. I am voting for the guy that is willing to listen that may fall short of what I want over the guy who is willfully ignorant every fucking day of the week.
10950,2020-08-20 01:30:31,iczcla,It’s a start. Pressure him once he’s in office. You want the other guy who says it’s a hoax?

10957,2020-08-20 01:32:56,iczcla,"I don't think it's bad for be proud of their heritage, as long as it's not done in a way to diminish others. I know that many Americans are proud of their Irish, German, Scandanavian, heritage, etc. Even those who aren't attached to their European roots are proud of their Appalachian heritage, Southern heritage, PNW, New Yorker, Bostonian, even Floridian, Ohian, etc. 

My girlfriend always makes a big deal of St. Paddy's day, and shared unique Irish-American food her family makes, it was neat. In return I've gotten to share Jamaican food that I grew up eating in my family. 

I think it's cool to recognize the things that make us unique and why that gives us strength. It's even better when we share these unique aspects and make something new. American rock and roll as an example is a unique creation that took elements of black American music, Appalachian folk music, and more."

10960,2020-08-20 02:11:43,iczcla,"> Defund the police, right?

I understand that it is difficult for some people to understand what that phrase really means.

""Defund the police"" is just a slogan that supports divesting funds from police departments and reallocating them to non-policing forms of public safety and community support, such as social services, youth services, housing, education, healthcare and other community resources."
10961,2020-08-20 02:09:43,iczcla,Reform the police
10962,2020-08-20 02:34:33,iczcla,Your implied argument would be stronger if there weren't warehouses full of untested rape kits just sitting around as the statute of limitations pass by.

10964,2020-08-20 03:25:27,iczcla,"I'm curious why. Not gonna attack, I promise!"
10965,2020-08-20 03:25:55,iczcla,Why?
10966,2020-08-20 03:26:08,iczcla,"I haven’t been watching that much but listening and reading after the fact, and I wouldn’t have watched the traditional convention either. But I wonder what has turned you off?  I can see a neutral response, and optimistically see the high points, but wonder about your take on the negative."

10974,2020-08-20 03:39:42,iczcla,She was pointing out racial injustice but it's funny that in your head you thought she was attacking you.
10975,2020-08-20 03:36:00,iczcla,Did she call them racists? I didn't hear that at all.
10976,2020-08-20 03:44:25,iczcla,Why weren't any Trump or his supporters questioning Biden's birth qualifications?

2, you heard the man, this election is about first saving our democracy from Trump. You want to talk about a massacre of the progressive movement? That’s what a 2nd term of Trump would be."

10999,2020-08-20 02:13:29,iczcla,He is willing to learn from his mistakes and has proven so. Look how progressive his agenda is right now. Bernie and warren and all of us have helped him do that. Don’t vote on the past especially when the stakes are living or dying with Trump

It’s easy now in 2020 to say that the Crime Bill is bad..."
11001,2020-08-20 02:13:49,iczcla,Bernie voted for the crime bill before the VAWA was written

Please, vote for those who will preserve our democracy this year, so we can continue down this progressive path. If Trump wins, there is little hope for any of these changes, for years to come, optimistically.

Please listen to the convention tonight, or any past or future night, and compare the dialogue with that of the Republican Party. Given our choices this year, there is clearly one option that gives us a chance for progress, not further decay to our democracy."

I supported Bernie. I gave money. I pushed. And now I'll follow Bernie when he says to support Biden. Because I trusted Bernie then, and I trust him now. And he cares about the well-being of his fellow countrymen and where their future lies. If he acted like you, he would take his ball and not play. Or worse, subvert the game so everyone loses.

11053,2020-08-20 14:46:59,iczcla,"One spurious data point in common (which really isn't in common at all) and both campaigns are exactly the same?

A Murcialago and a Focus both have headlight's, exact same car right?"
11054,2020-08-20 01:58:30,iczcla,Buzz off
11055,2020-08-20 01:59:07,iczcla,Don’t need luck. The combo of anger and hope is a knockout.
11056,2020-08-20 01:59:25,iczcla,Yawn... try harder.
11057,2020-08-20 01:59:32,iczcla,"The Dems want to help people. The GOP want to help the wealthy and privileged, they are the ones who serve corporate interests. The Dems aren't virtue *signalling*, they are advocating for virtue *doing*. The choice is really quite simple"
11058,2020-08-20 01:58:42,iczcla,"Anyone is better than Trump, though"
11059,2020-08-20 01:59:04,iczcla,"Nah, the DNC really hasn’t been that bad tbh"
11060,2020-08-20 02:00:08,iczcla,Yeah and that choice is fucking EASY. Don’t be an idiot
11061,2020-08-20 02:00:26,iczcla,that was hype as fuck
11062,2020-08-20 02:00:31,iczcla,Please go away. Those of who aren't living in Moscow are enjoying this.
11063,2020-08-20 02:00:50,iczcla,Creepy and cringey in what way?
11064,2020-08-20 02:00:51,iczcla,Whatever buddy. Thanks for the advice. Lol.
11065,2020-08-20 01:58:42,iczcla,It’s depressing living here
11066,2020-08-20 02:59:39,iczcla,Nahmala
11067,2020-08-20 03:00:05,iczcla,Shamala was her mum’s actual name
11068,2020-08-20 03:00:29,iczcla,Shamala is her mom’s name so... I think it’s okay for her to mention.
11069,2020-08-20 03:01:29,iczcla,Um. Shamala's her mom's name.
11070,2020-08-20 13:53:24,iczcla,what the fuck
11071,2020-08-20 14:51:08,iczcla,"Biden’s death drive is insanely high, it’s why all he can do is remember old times, it’s an acknowledgement that the government would rather charge to their graves full speed ahead than throw anyone a life raft"
11072,2020-08-20 01:28:42,iczcla,"Or you know, someone nervous."
11073,2020-08-20 01:28:37,iczcla,Or bright lights and a fog machine.
11074,2020-08-20 01:28:44,iczcla,Lighting probably.
11075,2020-08-20 01:32:36,iczcla,She's shared that she has Tourettes and that it comes with uncontrollable facial tics at times.
11076,2020-08-20 01:32:37,iczcla,She has Tourette’s that manifests as physical tics.
11077,2020-08-20 02:51:18,iczcla,Haha my goodness. Please text IMANIDIOT to 1-800-YOMAMA please.
11078,2020-08-20 02:48:09,iczcla,Putin thanks you for your vote.
11079,2020-08-20 01:42:32,iczcla,"He targeted criminals, not families"
11080,2020-08-20 01:40:40,iczcla,He also created DACA
11081,2020-08-20 01:41:34,iczcla,And now he's advocating for not doing that
11082,2020-08-20 01:43:23,iczcla,We cannot take in the millions and millions of undocumented immigrants that come here every year. Its unfortunate but that's reality. Obama never threw kids in cages. He never deported veterans or their families. He never gassed them....I'm not sure what your point is but the answers to our problems are complicated.
11083,2020-08-20 02:19:01,iczcla,"The pandemic demanded it. Any serious uniform federal response would have meant that we shut it down much earlier and been past it.

Its the USA. Maybe we can't do as well as South Korea or New Zealand. But we're literally at the worst as far as managing among any developed country."
11084,2020-08-20 02:18:29,iczcla,"Even if there is a lockdown, you can provide stimulus to small business. A lot of the money went to the bigger companies which could have stayed afloat without the money."
11085,2020-08-20 02:19:26,iczcla,Lockdowns wouldn't have been necessary if we had national testing capabilities and a PPE surplus.
11086,2020-08-20 02:20:47,iczcla,"Lockdowns are good. We just need more support for businesses during them. And we could have used better leadership to lessen the spread of the virus too, sadly our president set a humiliatingly bad example for the country, an awful role model, it took so long for him to even wear a mask, and he called the virus a democratic hoax"
11087,2020-08-20 02:20:59,iczcla,"Medical and scientific experts recommended lockdowns which, if widely and consistently implemented, would have been smart public policy because it would have prevented the virus from spreading so the economy wouldn't have to be shut down indefinitely."
11088,2020-08-20 03:26:10,iczcla,"One of the many great things Kamala will bring as VP.  Her experience prosecuting crooked bankers, charities etc will help shape Joe's approach to banking and corporate industry regulation.  Gives Joe an insight he's probably never had before.

Gonna be so refreshing having a President who actually respects and listens to the experience around him, rather than just zoning out after the first chart like the current muppet."
11089,2020-08-20 08:18:51,iczcla,Trump \*is\* ass.
11090,2020-08-20 08:49:00,iczcla,Nah he's not that cool
11091,2020-08-20 06:09:39,iczcla,He does. I'll hold my nose and vote for that old codger though
11092,2020-08-20 03:04:07,iczcla,"Not sure why I’m engaging an apparently insane person but...Seriously hope you’re not serious. What an insane fucking statement, not least because “science” hasn’t had nearly enough time to study something like that.

Have some self respect."
11093,2020-08-20 03:04:54,iczcla,Peer reviewed source for this?
11094,2020-08-20 03:04:01,iczcla,Have a source for this? Because sounds like some BS
11095,2020-08-20 03:08:41,iczcla,I think we are all low on vitamin d from qurantine
11096,2020-08-20 00:43:50,iczcla,"Lmao if anyone wants some actually hilarious material, check out his history — it reeks of dumb, angry, petulant, gullible inᴄel."
11097,2020-08-20 01:25:31,iczcla,"Coal jobs in the US fell from about 860,000 in 1925 to 125,000 in 1965.

They then fell from about 125,000 in 1965 to 80,000 in 2015.

The goal industry died a long time ago. More people work at Denny's then as coal miners in the U.S."
11098,2020-08-20 01:23:16,iczcla,They literally showed one person on a computer in that entire montage lol. We'll need a lot more than coders.
11099,2020-08-20 01:25:37,iczcla,Their jobs are going to disappear no matter what. Offering programs to shift their careers would benefit them and their families more than doing nothing.
11100,2020-08-20 01:26:07,iczcla,"How about learn to repair other machinery, install various forms of renewable energy, or about 10000 other jobs that can be created."
11101,2020-08-20 01:26:07,iczcla,They dont want to listen.  There was a real plan to shift over coal workers to greener energy sources.  Coal is already on the way out
11102,2020-08-20 01:26:21,iczcla,It's a dying industry.
11103,2020-08-20 01:50:52,iczcla,Um they have been talking about that yesterday and today...
11104,2020-08-20 01:51:56,iczcla,Try leaving your house. Millions of people are excited about this. You can't throw a stone without hitting an excited Democrat right now.
11105,2020-08-20 01:51:42,iczcla,"That’s what this ticket is about. Healthcare is a key issue. Yes, Joe isn’t Obama inspirational, but he will get the job done on the issues that matter."
11106,2020-08-20 01:52:14,iczcla,Do you think this works on anyone?
11107,2020-08-20 02:18:21,iczcla,We blame him for a lack of a national response including aide. His first roll out was terrible and there is no second one. It is his fault.
11108,2020-08-20 02:18:28,iczcla,You clearly are.
11109,2020-08-20 02:18:51,iczcla,"It’s not about shutting down, it’s about not supporting small businesses."
11110,2020-08-20 02:19:37,iczcla,Well we elected Trump so clearly we're very stupid.
11111,2020-08-20 02:21:49,iczcla,"No. But people can see that with an actually consistent response, the shutdown would've been relatively short. Businesses would've gotten loans to get them through two or three months while the first wave of the pandemic ran its course, and people would've gotten relief for that same time period. After three months at the longest, business could re-open, with precautions being taken but the pandemic being MUCH more under control

Instead, six months later, here we are. Barely better now than we were in March in most of the country. Governors aren't to blame for that. The buck stops with one person, and he's been fucking it up."
11112,2020-08-20 02:24:24,iczcla,"More people dead relative to population than any developed country. Perhaps if we had a leader that didn’t totally blow the pandemic response we wouldn‘t need to still socially distance.

Also should we have followed the response of Florida’s governor? That worked so well right.

Freaken’ troll!"
11113,2020-08-20 02:19:16,iczcla,It is actually amazing.
11114,2020-08-20 03:07:29,iczcla,"Sure, but since Trump sucks up all the oxygen in the room, it is going to get framed as a head to head match up."
11115,2020-08-20 03:06:30,iczcla,you don’t like how she’s phrasing it huh
11116,2020-08-20 03:12:01,iczcla,Lmao there was like 20 min of only policy platform. Fuck off
11117,2020-08-20 03:12:02,iczcla,That is not what conventions are for.
11118,2020-08-20 03:14:26,iczcla,"Like so many policy mentions tonight, I feel like I’m watching a different convention than some of you"
11119,2020-08-20 03:15:24,iczcla,"If you want to read into policy, go check out the website. This speech was an “inspire hope” speech. Policy will be discussed in length over the next several weeks."
11120,2020-08-20 03:14:12,iczcla,being a relatively normal person is a policy
11121,2020-08-20 01:54:58,iczcla,"I can think of over 170,000 reasons why you’re wrong."
11122,2020-08-20 01:54:56,iczcla,You would need a mind first.
11123,2020-08-20 01:55:34,iczcla,Lmao if you really think this there's no changing your mind it's to small to fit anymore ideas in
11124,2020-08-20 01:54:39,iczcla,I don’t think I need to. Good luck though man
11125,2020-08-20 01:54:50,iczcla,Ok. Vote for him then 🤷🏼‍♀️
11126,2020-08-20 01:55:38,iczcla,Helps to have a mind first.
11127,2020-08-20 01:56:33,iczcla,"It depends on your goal! Want the US to go into the shitter, like Putin! Vote Trump."
11128,2020-08-20 01:55:05,iczcla,No one’s falling for this lol
11129,2020-08-20 01:55:06,iczcla,"If you believe this, there is no changing your mind."
11130,2020-08-20 01:57:34,iczcla,"Trump betrayed American allies fighting ISIS, because he couldn't handle a phone call.

Trump allowed Putin GRU to put bounties on US service members, with no push back."

11132,2020-08-20 01:58:32,iczcla,"Kanye is a better pick, then Trump change my mind"
11133,2020-08-20 02:52:40,iczcla,Feel better?
11134,2020-08-20 03:05:40,iczcla,This is Whig erasure
11135,2020-08-20 03:06:24,iczcla,"Aww, well, you tried."
11136,2020-08-20 03:06:45,iczcla,Hurrrr durrrr
11137,2020-08-20 03:06:52,iczcla,"We can all vote, bitterness"
11138,2020-08-20 03:09:02,iczcla,"how dare you leave out the Anti-Federalists, Federalists, Whigs, Democratic-Republicans, and National Unionists"
11139,2020-08-20 03:08:25,iczcla,"What's better, voting libertarian for failed gop economics, just with a bit more tolerance of gay people (but also allowing discrimination) and pro weed?"
11140,2020-08-20 01:55:38,iczcla,Look in a mirror boo
11141,2020-08-20 01:56:21,iczcla,"Shot the messenger all you want, but don't shoot the message.

11143,2020-08-20 02:40:25,iczcla,Having a black president broke the psyche of rural white america.
11144,2020-08-20 02:40:50,iczcla,White anger about their perception of POC taking from them and keeping them down.

11146,2020-08-20 02:40:48,iczcla,Racism and sexism.
11147,2020-08-20 02:41:03,iczcla,A good/great President can’t fight hate innate in the people that carry it.  A piece-of-shit President can stoke their fires though.
11148,2020-08-20 02:44:28,iczcla,"The racists and sexists came out in full force because they were mad they couldn't be racist and sexists,  and the republican primary candidates never came together until it was too late"
11149,2020-08-20 02:42:36,iczcla,Obama served two terms. It wasn't Obama v. Trump. People didn't believe Trump would win due to him being so outlandish and didn't bother to vote. People should be more motivated now.
11150,2020-08-20 02:45:26,iczcla,Racism. And also the fact that there is also a back and forth voting trend with presidents. Then there is the US's fascination with celebrity.
11151,2020-08-20 02:49:03,iczcla,"There is a lot to unpack in your question. There are many reasons why we ended up with Trump. 1) Many people did not like Clinton and refused to vote for her. They voted for Trump, a write-in candidate, or 3rd party candidate.  2) Other people felt that Clinton had the election in the bag and did not feel the need to vote. 3) There is a fairly large group of voters that have felt alienated by the Democrats and the government in general and they felt like someone like Trump could come in and ""drain the swamp"" or clean house."
11152,2020-08-20 03:01:15,iczcla,Stop spamming.
11153,2020-08-20 02:58:18,iczcla,"Right the hugs and shoulder rubs. Yeah, glad he apologized and worked on stopping and did but let’s now talk about Trump and his BFF Epstein and the actual sexual acts with children, and others"
11154,2020-08-20 02:58:21,iczcla,We're setting all that stuff aside until 11/4.
11155,2020-08-20 03:00:10,iczcla,Trump paid for his whore wife and raped countless other women tho
11156,2020-08-20 03:00:22,iczcla,"Joe responded to those allegations. If you read his response and the actual allegations you’d know there’s nothing awkward about Kamala believing those women. Joe’s a grandpa with personal space issues, like most grandparents. He apologized and admitted fault, unlike the man in office whose been accused of much, much worse."
11157,2020-08-20 03:00:40,iczcla,"Of course she believes them. Joe believes them. This is just referencing the women who said his public behavior of being physically close was uncomfortable. Joe apologized and acknowledged their feelings and promised to change, and hasn't acted that way since. This has nothing to do with the debunked assault claim."
11158,2020-08-20 03:01:28,iczcla,"Imagine if he cheated on his third wife with a pornstar months after she gave birth. 
AWKWARD"
11159,2020-08-20 02:37:20,iczcla,Spare us your crocodile years and false concern.
11160,2020-08-20 02:56:08,iczcla,Well you’re kinda screwed. Trump is campaigning strongly against your position. “THE RADICAL DEMS WANNA DEFUND COPS!”
11161,2020-08-20 02:57:14,iczcla,I think Biden and Kamala are on that bandwagon too
11162,2020-08-20 02:57:43,iczcla,Have you taken the time to find out how she stands on any of those issues now? Are trump and pence really the better option when it comes to the issues that impact you and your community at home?
11163,2020-08-20 02:57:47,iczcla,Have fun with Trump
11164,2020-08-20 02:58:38,iczcla,I think most people agree with you but understand voting trump out is way more important
11165,2020-08-20 00:51:56,iczcla,Welcome to Trumps America.  Are we great again yet?

11169,2020-08-20 00:53:31,iczcla,"One can only hope. I mean, that is their job. Giving leadership, brokering solutions. Unless your kink is following strange fringe online groups vomiting outlandish ideas, while waiting for your Russian beau to call so you can shatter your kneecaps diving at his zipper."
11170,2020-08-20 00:56:25,iczcla,Will you post on an account older then 26 days?
11171,2020-08-20 00:57:55,iczcla,I live in a city. Nothing is burning.
11172,2020-08-20 00:56:59,iczcla,"The joke is that Trump could have come out on the day the protests started and delivered whatever speech was written for him to show empathy and tell people he's going to try to solve the problem and that might have actually ended the protests. He could've been a good politician and told people things that sounded good to quell the masses, even if it was all lies. But he couldn't even do that much. He let things simmer for two weeks and then called the protesters terrorists. He instigated more and more violence and never once addressed the problem that millions of Americans were crying out about. He's worse than worthless, he's actively a danger to the stability of the country."
11173,2020-08-20 01:00:55,iczcla,Let me guess. You never left the shitty little town you grew up in and have never actually been in an American city cause you're terrified of all the scary liberals.
11174,2020-08-20 01:10:32,iczcla,That's your takeaway from this? Fucking hell.
11175,2020-08-20 01:11:00,iczcla,why
11176,2020-08-20 01:50:08,iczcla,Don’t you have a hate rally to attend somewhere? Maskless? Scram
11177,2020-08-20 02:33:48,iczcla,"If you’re crying about norms when Trump is your president, get out of here"
11178,2020-08-20 02:33:48,iczcla,"Trump violated all the norms,  and some women. It's justified."
11179,2020-08-20 02:33:44,iczcla,Your predecessor?? Dumb
11180,2020-08-20 02:33:46,iczcla,I mean Trump is going to be rage-tweeting from his toilet until the day he dies so that norm is out the window
11181,2020-08-20 02:34:24,iczcla,Unprecedented for nearly 4 years deserves unprecedented back for 20 minutes.
11182,2020-08-20 02:34:51,iczcla,Bush?
11183,2020-08-20 02:34:47,iczcla,"Trump, the king of maintinaing norms.  He's the first president who openly hates the people he governs."
11184,2020-08-20 02:34:46,iczcla,I hope Biden violates more than a few norms when it comes to prosecuting Trump.
11185,2020-08-20 02:36:54,iczcla,Honor died on the beach.
11186,2020-08-20 03:01:16,iczcla,"Not usually, but Trump literally tweeted white power. If Romney was your Republican candidate, then the white supremacy card wouldn’t work."
11187,2020-08-20 03:04:45,iczcla,Yes
11188,2020-08-20 03:10:49,iczcla,Anyone that cracked 10% in a field of dozens is pretty skilled.
11189,2020-08-20 03:10:00,iczcla,"I missed it. Did she says she's a great campaigner?

Or are you just feebly trying to land a hit against her?"
11190,2020-08-20 03:09:39,iczcla,VP doesn't have to be a campaigner
11191,2020-08-20 01:54:27,iczcla,If you think she's evil you must really hate Trump.
11192,2020-08-20 01:54:29,iczcla,No she isn’t.
11193,2020-08-20 01:54:46,iczcla,Donald Trump is our president and *she’s* evil personified?
11194,2020-08-20 01:57:23,iczcla,Denying people unemployment and benefits during a pandemic is evil. You don't know what evil is.
11195,2020-08-20 01:55:08,iczcla,"Nah. Trump is the literal definition of the term. Hillary's... well, a mixed bag, but certainly not the personification."
11196,2020-08-20 01:55:23,iczcla,so what

Doctor was in use for many centuries before there were universities, or degrees. It was used to refer to an especially learned person, one who was authorized and qualified to teach a particular subject. Which might be medicine, philosophy, theology, law, logic, history, etc. 

It wasn't until the Twelfth Century AD in Europe that the modern Western universities were invented. The first universities were Guilds, of Masters or Students, and the Masters were Doctors, i.e, authorized teachers. Gradually the Bachelor's, Master's, and Doctor's degrees evolved from a guild structure of Apprentice, Journeyman, and Master."""

The Bill included good things like the Violence Against Women Act, the Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act, Community Policing provisions, along with negatives including Death Penalty expansion, new federal offenses, and other items that depending on your viewpoint could be good or bad (such as the federal assault weapons ban.).

If Trump gets a second term, you can kiss ANY progressive desires goodbye. He won't even stop at two terms. He's said as much, several times now. 

Biden isn't perfect, but literally a shoe is better than Trump. At least a shoe wouldn't try to dismantle our democracy for personal gain. Or eliminate the pandemic team we had in place, because Obama made it. Or countless other things.

Besides, Biden's campaign is more progressive than Hillary's overall. If we get minimum wage up to 15 an hour, that'll be huge.  The fact that it's 7.25 on the federal level is an insult. Not to mention, those jobs often aren't easy at all. People that say ""even a monkey can do it!"" clearly haven't worked at a busy fast food restaurant. It's hell for the pay. Not everything is about skill.

Basically the conversation is about illegal immigrants in general. The sheriff Trump's talking to brings up MS-13 as an extreme example. Trump then makes broad statements about people ""coming into the country"" and how they're animals. 

Honestly, who the hell knows what was in his brain at that second, whether he was thinking of all immigrants or MS-13; it's impossible to know. But it's clearly, at best, very reckless language that fits into a pattern of dehumanization and racism."

11484,2020-08-20 01:21:44,iczcla,It was a Sarah Palin ad blaming the leaders of 20 Congressional districts which voted for McCain / Palin in the 2008 election for their votes to pass the ACA.

11493,2020-08-20 01:11:25,iczcla,He referred to Obama and his policies as 'stupid' several times today during his televised rally (aka press conference) earlier today. How the Orange Goo Sac can call anyone stupid is beyond me.
11494,2020-08-20 03:08:22,iczcla,Seriously?
11495,2020-08-20 01:12:34,iczcla,he was pre-functioning losing it earlier today so he should be warmed up for a complete Tweetdown.

11506,2020-08-20 01:02:50,iczcla,you really think Biden chose his VP because of the order people spoke on day 3 of a virtual convention? And you don't think he chose his VP before it was announced? And once again you believe he would change his VP because of the order in which people spoke at a virtual convention?
11507,2020-08-20 03:15:20,iczcla,Obama was originally planned to go after Harris. Obama asked them to switch it in the last 48 hours.

11510,2020-08-20 01:37:59,iczcla,Agreed. It seems like she’s willing to risk getting deported knowing that if Trump did that it could be enough to finally destroy his veil and expose his lack of empathy to a point of no return.

But I actually did support Bernie for most of the primaries before switching to Hillary at the last minute, largely due to her performance in the Congressional hearings. I can understand being frustrated with Biden if you're as left or further left than Bernie. But I've never thought that a president would start taking mailboxes out of neighborhoods, dismantling postal machines, ignoring all Congressional summons, coopting the military, claiming he has magical authority to make anything happen that he wants. Like, at what point does a person not realize this is exactly how a democracy gets dismantled?"
11522,2020-08-20 04:40:30,iczcla,"Thank you for this. I'm really hoping that if we take the Senate we can start making it easier to elect Democrats across the board. Correcting gerrymandering and voter suppression, making no-excuse mail-in voting available in every state, ensuring election security, possibly giving DC and Puerto Rico statehood, and who knows, maybe someday getting rid of the electoral college. Once we take the Republican thumb off the scale that's been there for so long, both parties will be forced to shift leftward (just like the Reagan vs Mondale and Bush vs Dukakis blowout elections of the 80s shifted both parties far to the right.) If we can actually get some representative democracy going... I have to believe that those changes, combined with the inevitably shrinking Boomer/Silent Generation demographic, will actually give us a chance for major progress over the next few decades."

11525,2020-08-20 03:44:17,iczcla,RNC has to be absolutely scrambling right now. They have to fill at least 2-3 hours every night for four nights and with what? Shitty iPhone video from the MyPillow guy and the Covington KKKids?
11526,2020-08-20 03:32:38,iczcla,I am so impressed they are pulling this off. I’ve had so many damn problems with screenshare apps over the last few months in meeting and whatnot I was sure there was going to be technical fuckups and some awkward shit. But by god they’ve managed so far.
11527,2020-08-20 02:16:37,iczcla,Going to be interesting to see if the RNC tries to copy this style. More likely they go the lazy route and have people angrily ranting about shit for hours.

I've been in a lot of locker rooms my whole life. I'm a pretty damn good athlete.  Any guy that talked that way was usually the fattest, ugliest S.O.B. in the room.""

Edit: After a little bit of googling it seems that [Joe Biden has been itching to kick Donald Trump's ass since 2016.](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/joe-biden-donald-trump-behind-the-gym-230174)"
11533,2020-08-20 00:45:44,iczcla,"For real. SOMEONE high profile needs to stoop to his damn level. Insult his intelligence. Mock and laugh at the stupid things he has done. Make fun of his hair and weight, even. Basically...someone needs to have John Oliver's writers write their speech for them."
11534,2020-08-20 02:57:57,iczcla,"I really hope they do, but while still staying away from anything superficial. I hope they destroy him with his own words and actions. And there's plenty to go around. I think the convention will be fairly clear, but the debates, I really cannot wait for them to bring all the receipts."

Wow, so they got the Parkland high school shooter to stump for them? 

I wonder what the Repubs pulled with the prison to get him on their roster like that!"
11540,2020-08-20 02:14:16,iczcla,They got the two crazies who waved guns at BLM protesters. What's not to love about that?
11541,2020-08-20 08:25:31,iczcla,Just a livestream of his twitter feed for five minutes

11543,2020-08-20 02:09:28,iczcla,Same except it's cannabis instead of alcohol.
11544,2020-08-20 02:03:28,iczcla,Growing up with two alcoholic parents ruined drinking for me. lol

11555,2020-08-20 03:02:09,iczcla,Yep my bet is on lots of looting footage.

11560,2020-08-20 00:23:29,iczcla,"This speech is honestly one of the best I have seen in my entire life.  He didn't fall into the convention tropes of engaging the audience to get them ""hyped up.""  It was like a boulder going down a hill picking up momentum.  The pure energy in the last third is absolutely spine tingling.  As a Communications grad (who actually loves public speaking and took multiple courses in it), I wish I had been able to do something even just a fourth as good as this is.  Both he and Michelle may be two of the most articulate people I have seen.  I just always am in awe of their presence."
11561,2020-08-20 01:14:02,iczcla,My personal favorite is [JFKs speech at Rice University]( https://youtu.be/QXqlziZV63k)

I remember seeing on TV a black woman pulled over on the side of the road sobbing and waving her hands like she felt the spirit when Obama won the presidency. That snapshot is in my memory forever. One true moment. Seems like a 100 years ago. I want that FEELING again. That we WON.
11563,2020-08-20 00:20:10,iczcla,It is. I pull up this speech every once in awhile when I'm feeling particularly defeated about the state of things.
11564,2020-08-20 00:19:21,iczcla,"It is hope!  Feels good, doesn't it?"
11565,2020-08-20 03:10:22,iczcla,Absolutely. And everything that we’ve been missing.
11566,2020-08-20 05:09:09,iczcla,"Badly ran campaign, poor fundraising, and she had two competitors squatting on her best demos, keeping her at #2 with both (Biden with older Blacks, and Warren with college-educated women.) She got boxed in and kept there, and didn't really have a path to grow. When Bernie started out-polling her in California, that was pretty much it for her--call the campaign to prevent a home state loss and a show of vulnerability."
11567,2020-08-20 03:10:18,iczcla,"I'm sure the DNC was prepping her for VP, and asked her to leave the race when she did."
11568,2020-08-20 03:15:21,iczcla,"The ""I know a predator when I see one"" was savage.  And then she smiled and moved onto heartwarming content."

11571,2020-08-20 06:39:03,iczcla,Genius. I'm going to will myself to remember it this way.

But you know, he wishes his old pal Maxwell the best."

11580,2020-08-20 03:54:09,iczcla,so the public announcement of an investigation right before the election had absolutely no impact on people's opinions of Clinton?

11584,2020-08-20 03:24:25,iczcla,"Which is really odd.

One of my close friends was a very high level person in Bernie’s campaign team and him and all his Bernie campaign staff are all on Instagram all about Joe and Kamala. If Bernie himself is backing Joe then so should the people backing Bernie. I donated money to Bernies campaign. I went to events. I met him at a house in Los Angeles for a campaign staff fundraiser. Bernie wanted to win, but he didn’t. Now, Bernie wants Joe, not Trump. Help him out. Please."
11585,2020-08-20 03:25:09,iczcla,No need for that kind of division here. We all need to come together.

11589,2020-08-20 03:47:53,iczcla,"Important to remember that Bernie and Harris have worked on lots of legislation together, and apparently Harris was Bernie's preferred choice for VP (for Biden, if I'm not mistaken.)"
11590,2020-08-20 04:00:45,iczcla,"When you think of the GOP as a bunch of old racist dudes it makes sense, but they also have the solid support of the incels. Why don't they leverage the basement dwellers for IT support?"

11603,2020-08-20 06:42:32,iczcla,More people used to watch when TV options were slimmer but voter apathy and a zillion other distractions kept most people from caring for a long time.  Maybe the one positive thing to Trump's presidency is people waking up to the fact that their vote CAN matter.

I mean, technically it’s been possible for women looking like Kamala to fun for VP for a while, but the social climate (i.e.: racism/sexism) prevented them from achieving it.

I agree with you though — people shouldn’t expect people of a certain race to be happy with a candidate just because they look like them. However, it can be a happy and fulfilling moment ."

The Northern states didn't want slaves to count in representation at all, only free people. Southern states wanted slaves to count in full (5/5ths). 

Counter intuitively, not counting at all would actually be *beneficial* to slaves, and detrimental to slaveholders as a class, since it would raise the political cost of having a class of people who were treated as property.  By giving representation based on slave population, slaveholders were able to retain political power nationally and prevent slavery from being curtailed. It was a political subsidy to slavery, in other words. And it was powerful. Look at who held the presidency in the early Republic. 

This deeply flawed compromise fell apart just seven decades later, resulting in an effective re-founding of the country at gunpoint in the bloodiest conflict in American history (in % of population terms)."

11742,2020-08-20 02:13:45,iczcla,"Im not even kidding when some right-wing pundits will make this out to be a bad thing, its going to happen."
11743,2020-08-20 03:14:33,iczcla,"I find it deeply offensive you compare an unthinking fetus to any of the people who told their stories tonight, or who were highlighted in tonight's speeches as among the best of us.  Shame on you."

11746,2020-08-20 03:06:55,iczcla,Agreed!

11754,2020-08-20 03:30:47,iczcla,This was 100% my initial reaction. Then I was like.. this is Trump..Would it really shock me?

I am fully prepared for the token black republican who will scold us about how actually it's the democrats who are racist"
11757,2020-08-20 03:59:37,iczcla,"RNC can't even do that correctly. In 2016 they had Patricia Smith, whose estranged son died in the Benghazi attack, talking about how she personally blamed Hillary. A slam dunk for the base, right? They CUT AWAY FROM HER so that Trump could make an unscheduled appearance to bash Kasich for not appearing at the RNC convention. You can't make this shit up."
11758,2020-08-20 03:52:25,iczcla,and conspiracies. you forgot conspiracies.
11759,2020-08-20 03:52:55,iczcla,honestly i would tune in for that
11760,2020-08-20 04:01:35,iczcla,"Yeah. Probably feature a few people whose beautiful young blonde daughter was murdered by a Muslim or run over by a car driven by an illegal immigrant, and use those cherry picked cases to argue for their racist, xenophobic, hateful & selfish platform."
11761,2020-08-20 04:05:05,iczcla,well the other thing i read today is that they're going to have trump give a speech every single night. just seems....boring

11773,2020-08-20 02:59:45,iczcla,Yeah since Michelle has made it clear she is done with politics I don't think Obama would have run again.
11774,2020-08-20 02:57:28,iczcla,I think we as a people (in general) broke him by the end.
11775,2020-08-20 01:28:26,iczcla,Hopefully it results in well staffed polling places since you don't have to be 18 to work at one.
11776,2020-08-20 01:10:22,iczcla,I think Northam and the legislature are going to get us drop boxes so I may opt of in-person this time around.

With a healthy dollop of syrupy, poisonous nationalism."
11784,2020-08-20 02:56:52,iczcla,"Its going to look like angry out of control ranting and fearmongering, exactly what they want."
11785,2020-08-20 03:07:49,iczcla,"Are we doing to even see it? They might want to keep it on the down low if they're going to be talking about controversial, unpopular topics that might negatively impact them."
11786,2020-08-20 03:11:35,iczcla,"Even though I am a Canadian, I really enjoyed the roll call with the videos of all the states and territories. Very cool, they should do it that way from now on."
11787,2020-08-20 02:59:21,iczcla,Seriously! How cool is that? :-)
11788,2020-08-20 03:05:29,iczcla,It didn’t his meltdown long at all.

11791,2020-08-20 03:18:32,iczcla,"I don’t think so. I saw it on Democracy Now. Here is the [article](https://www.democracynow.org/2020/8/19/headlines/rnc_to_feature_st_louis_couple_who_threatened_to_shoot_black_lives_matter_protesters). Crazy, eh?"
11792,2020-08-20 04:24:05,iczcla,clearly you weren't watching tonight
11793,2020-08-20 04:25:26,iczcla,"My advice is to actually read their platform. It’s not bad.

It’s not what I wanted. But better than anything else being presented.

Try reading it. It’s not just”I’m not trump”"
11794,2020-08-20 04:52:47,iczcla,This is true if you refuse to read their platform.

Try harder."
11797,2020-08-20 05:31:28,iczcla,He'd do great. Has been a lot recently.
11798,2020-08-20 03:31:29,iczcla,parts of it are. The Covington guy is actually speaking shit you not

11803,2020-08-20 02:14:47,iczcla,I’m also predicting that. Keeping my fingers crossed.
11804,2020-08-20 02:16:22,iczcla,I think what they’re doing right now is exactly that. They’re consistently showing the exact things that Trump is incapable of. Trump has no answer to that and this will consume him
11805,2020-08-20 02:37:49,iczcla,The audacity of taupe!
11806,2020-08-20 03:00:05,iczcla,"Yeah, but don’t you wanna watch it happen. The spectacle alone will be worth the time. 😃"
11807,2020-08-20 03:07:11,iczcla,"Dude, Id legit vote for one of the Old Ones at this point.

Like the jokey slogan ""Why vote for the lesser evil?"""

11810,2020-08-20 03:37:28,iczcla,True.
11811,2020-08-20 03:50:43,iczcla,Where have you been for the last 1 week - under a tree?
11812,2020-08-20 04:03:17,iczcla,"Well for starters a large portion of the population is going to voting by mail, and the current administration is making that more difficult by dismantling vital sorting machines and mailing boxes, among other equipment. 

So voting should be made easier for those mail voters by restoring all the infrastructure that was dismantled, and treating Voting packages like Priority mail."
11813,2020-08-20 04:01:27,iczcla,"I mean reducing postal capacity at the same time that more states are moving to mail in ballots will certainly make it harder. So will reducing polling locations, which happened in multiple states."
11814,2020-08-20 03:54:20,iczcla,Obama actually was slated to go last but requested for Kamala to go after him instead. It’s a symbolic passing of the torch.
11815,2020-08-20 03:59:56,iczcla,"The reason Kamala was able to present herself that way is BECAUSE Barack went first and came hard. You'll get to see the punching up Kamala soon enough. But, tonight was her night to introduce herself to a lot of people who know nothing about her. Having her start out in attack mode would have fed the right wing ""angry black woman"" machine until election. Instead, they can be mad at Obama, but who cares - they don't like him anyway."
11816,2020-08-20 03:56:47,iczcla,"I saw an article that said it was Obama’s choice to let Kamala close out the night. Impossible act to follow, but it was the right decision. It’s her honor. She should go last."
11817,2020-08-20 04:03:02,iczcla,"As good as Obama's speech was, it was dark. The darkness was necessary and accentuated the seriousness of the moment, but you don't want to end the night on that.

Kamala's inspirational candidacy and personal story along with the official moment she accepts the VP nomination is a much more fitting end to the evening.

(as others have mentioned, there was also the passing of the torch symbolism, but IMO the above point is even more important.)"
11818,2020-08-20 03:55:31,iczcla,It was Obama's idea. He wanted to go before her as a symbolic way of passing the torch.
11819,2020-08-20 04:07:36,iczcla,"She's the VP nominee... it's her place to cap the night off as is tradition.   It wasn't OBama's night - it was her night.  

However, you are right - with something so powerful from Obama, that was a hard act to follow - yet he did a great segue for her and she took the mic and ran with it like a baton in a long distance race.  

The fact he spoke with such power as well as she did - that was awesome."
11820,2020-08-20 04:18:04,iczcla,Would Obama be able to be as politically involved if he was on the SC? I feel like he could have a larger impact not being on the SC.
11821,2020-08-20 03:55:05,iczcla,Obama and Clinton (Bill) both have that ability to speak/connect to normal people...Biden had it too speaking off script in '12 and even '16....he still can but it'd be lying to say he's as good as he used to be (given the increasing gaffes that make speaking off a prompter mandatory for him now)
11822,2020-08-20 01:20:21,iczcla,He should! He will be an amazing senator.
11823,2020-08-20 01:59:48,iczcla,That's more than two Benghazis!
11824,2020-08-20 02:02:56,iczcla,But also the energy and sense of power!
11825,2020-08-20 02:15:21,iczcla,True. I aimed too low.
11826,2020-08-20 02:47:30,iczcla,I thought that was why Eric was born.
11827,2020-08-20 03:02:40,iczcla,someone on reddit referred to him as a jar of warm mayonaise  and I thought it was rather apt.
11828,2020-08-20 03:03:42,iczcla,He’s lifeless and pathetic.

Of course, I know him as Chachi..."

11837,2020-08-20 02:39:03,iczcla,"Haha, let it happen. This night seems to be focused around activism and not letting those of us who aren't immigrants, women, or any other attacked class be comfortable.

Great clip btw!"

11856,2020-08-20 05:31:31,iczcla,I think a lot of Republicans are like fuck Trump. But hopefully they don't do that. (Not watching currently)

11864,2020-08-20 01:45:24,iczcla,Not yet
11865,2020-08-20 01:47:02,iczcla,Not yet. None of the big names for tonight have spoken yet (or at least given their main remarks; Kamala was briefly on at the beginning)
11866,2020-08-20 01:47:31,iczcla,No not yet.
11867,2020-08-20 01:46:43,iczcla,Yes and things like virtual roll call last night were really well executed. My point is tonight's schedule and pacing has been better than the previous 2 nights
11868,2020-08-20 01:58:53,iczcla,I hope they post that piece somewhere so I can share it with my girls for the rest of their lives.
11869,2020-08-20 02:03:33,iczcla,Totally agree. She proved me wrong these last 2 years. She has been a super successful speaker these last 2 years with an adversarial Senate and Presidency.
11870,2020-08-20 02:16:52,iczcla,"Yeah, when I first heard it, it seemed slightly clunky. But it's sounds better now that I'm used to it. Agreed. Good message."

11890,2020-08-20 03:46:05,iczcla,Didn’t your president have DIRECT ties to serial child predator/ sex trafficker Jeffery Epstein? Or is that lies and fake news?
11891,2020-08-20 06:43:58,iczcla,"Still are, but they’re more than welcome to spend money against Trump"
11892,2020-08-20 00:51:39,iczcla,He’s not capable of not making everything about himself.
11893,2020-08-20 00:59:13,iczcla,That's kind of funny. Biden is the nice uncle who hears you out and tries to help at times. Trump's the racist uncle you try not to invite to family gatherings.
11894,2020-08-20 01:04:36,iczcla,"Look, she's part of the Raw Underground"
11895,2020-08-20 01:22:32,iczcla,Yup... I only remember because it hit pretty close to home. I was in high school at the time and my school was less than a 30 minute drive from the school the shooting happened at.
11896,2020-08-20 01:24:29,iczcla,Let them speak to each other was my original idea.
11897,2020-08-20 01:31:53,iczcla,I'd be surprised after this if she wasn't coming
11898,2020-08-20 02:19:10,iczcla,I completely agree. It's the biggest travesty of 2016.
11899,2020-08-20 02:06:34,iczcla,It's a must at this point.
11900,2020-08-20 02:12:47,iczcla,"Hulu Live.  USA plays it a lot.  I know Netflix had it at one point, but not sure it's still on there."
11901,2020-08-20 02:13:41,iczcla,"I love her, fwiw; Kerry has just seemed the least “forced” in this slightly awkward new paradigm"
11902,2020-08-20 02:27:44,iczcla,"Exactly that.
 
The things that make us great."
11903,2020-08-20 02:36:53,iczcla,"Well, until he gets nominated to replace RBG."
11904,2020-08-20 03:04:42,iczcla,"For sure, I agree completely. We need him and leaders like him so much."
11905,2020-08-20 02:50:09,iczcla,"Yes, sir/madam!"
11906,2020-08-20 02:53:01,iczcla,I don't have the time or head space to worry about what Trump might do. I'm focusing on encouraging people to vote him out any legal way possible.
11907,2020-08-20 03:07:55,iczcla,I bet this goes twice as much for women
11908,2020-08-20 03:20:54,iczcla,Holy fuck my sides
11909,2020-08-20 03:21:03,iczcla,"Damn right.

She should have been with Bush too, but at least she finally sees it."
11910,2020-08-20 03:24:47,iczcla,"They're still talking to her?

That's surprising."
11911,2020-08-20 03:21:46,iczcla,MSNBC anchor. Was one of the top people in John McCain's presidential campaign.
11912,2020-08-20 03:29:02,iczcla,"Yep! Everyone who can vote early please vote early. Everyone who can mail in a ballot, fill it out and drop it in a designated box. 

But above all, vote."
11913,2020-08-20 03:58:26,iczcla,If I’d earned my way into millions and managed to push my agenda into the American consciousness I would certainly take no bullshit from pundits.
11914,2020-08-20 03:50:08,iczcla,Are Asian men adorable?
11915,2020-08-20 04:04:31,iczcla,Er when have Asian men been called adorable? This is a first time I'm hearing that lol
11916,2020-08-20 04:08:26,iczcla,Insert *ok then* gif
11917,2020-08-20 01:57:41,iczcla,Better than us being overthrown by Russia.
11918,2020-08-20 01:18:19,iczcla,False: Ted Cruz is one being and not several.
11919,2020-08-20 02:59:00,iczcla,why you gotta turn me on like that tho
11920,2020-08-20 01:28:42,iczcla,yosuh-might
11921,2020-08-20 01:29:53,iczcla,We all know Pence needs dat meat.
11922,2020-08-20 01:40:57,iczcla,"I’m okay with Bad Guy, but I definitely like some of her other songs more."
11923,2020-08-20 02:37:48,iczcla,"I don't plan to have kids for this exact reason, but I have friends that do. They were born this year and last, and honestly, I am not looking forward to them turning 16, 17, 18, and asking questions like ""Well, what did you do.""

I need to really kick it into gear and make sure they won't even have to ask that because it won't be an issue. I had a pretty good life, and that's a privilege. The least I can do is leave a world that allows the next generations to have a world that is hospitable to them."

11925,2020-08-20 02:26:02,iczcla,"Yeah I went to one of her rallies in NYC, she stuck around doing selfies for like 4 or 5 hours, it was crazy."
11926,2020-08-20 02:47:40,iczcla,It was over a month ago now but I’m still recovering. Hopefully I still have the antibodies come November 🙈🙈🙈
11927,2020-08-20 02:47:05,iczcla,Agreed!!!
11928,2020-08-20 02:54:14,iczcla,Yup if he had spoken in favour of one candidate earlier then the right would be sowing divisiveness with how he improperly blocked Sanders/Warren/Tulsi etc ...
11929,2020-08-20 02:49:27,iczcla,I assume that's always a safe bet.
11930,2020-08-20 02:49:29,iczcla,"Its all relative with satellite delay, streaming timing, etc."
11931,2020-08-20 02:50:40,iczcla,Yeah do we get past this this is brutal
11932,2020-08-20 03:39:18,iczcla,"He's pretty forgettable. I dont remember hearing him talk, nor doing anything (besides being the Covid 'czar' lmao)"
11933,2020-08-20 06:06:36,iczcla,"As I recall, not even Trump wanted Pence as his VP. The only reason it happened is because of Manafort insisting on it"
11934,2020-08-20 03:51:50,iczcla,"She was talking about her family and how it was full of people like ""brothers, sisters, nieces, nephews, chithis"" etc"
11935,2020-08-20 01:12:23,iczcla,That’s insane. But we’ve become so desensitized in this country.
11936,2020-08-20 02:30:19,iczcla,I feel like the GOP is giving the HRC treatment to AOC. AOC reminds me so much of HRC in her first term as First Lady. Very similar attitudes and very similar ability to strike fear into GOP men.
11937,2020-08-20 02:51:50,iczcla,"He’s just saying she’s going to be the next President, after Joe"
11938,2020-08-20 02:57:16,iczcla,"Well, he can't come here, to this virus-ridden Trump hellhole."
11939,2020-08-20 02:59:04,iczcla,He's not capable of love as we know it.
11940,2020-08-20 03:10:06,iczcla,I would definitely agree. That Obama speech felt historic. Certainly one of his best.
11941,2020-08-20 03:22:24,iczcla,I would laugh so hard.
11942,2020-08-20 03:25:33,iczcla,I’d bet anything she’s getting paid to stay quiet. The stripper First Lady renegotiated her deal when Trump was elected. I’m sure the exes and Tiffany did too.
11943,2020-08-20 03:22:50,iczcla,Yeah I'd be cool if he made a statement or endorsement for Biden but keep it out of here please
11944,2020-08-20 03:28:32,iczcla,Trump would feel defeated. Literally done. All the living Presidents against him.
11945,2020-08-20 03:29:09,iczcla,I’d love a Harris/Booker ticket in 2024
11946,2020-08-20 03:36:33,iczcla,Don't forget those two white boomers who brandished guns at peaceful protestors.
11947,2020-08-20 03:33:33,iczcla,How much can they get?
11948,2020-08-20 03:40:10,iczcla,What about Squidward’s house?
11949,2020-08-20 03:43:22,iczcla,"Trump doesn't have any friends. So yes, it's going to be word vomit."
11950,2020-08-20 02:08:28,iczcla,it's like drinking a glass of water after crossing a 4 year desert.  The best glass of water ever!
11951,2020-08-20 03:55:46,iczcla,What would I not give to see DT's face when that video was played for the first time in front of him😆
11952,2020-08-20 07:14:55,iczcla,No one who has ever won the popular vote will be appearing at the RNC
11953,2020-08-20 08:37:12,iczcla,I forgot Bush Sr had died.
11954,2020-08-20 01:25:12,iczcla,Should have been. But... dystopian as fuck remember.
11955,2020-08-20 01:50:27,iczcla,Um...yeah? I didn’t think hype was a generational thing lol
11956,2020-08-20 02:00:08,iczcla,They have but it still shouldn’t have gotten to this point.
11957,2020-08-20 02:01:34,iczcla,I feel like someone is trying to talk me into financing a car right now
11958,2020-08-20 02:08:14,iczcla,It’s still on
11959,2020-08-20 02:09:26,iczcla,Renewed for another three seasons at least 🙂
11960,2020-08-20 02:09:47,iczcla,No. Jayne Mansfield and Mickey Hargitay.
11961,2020-08-20 02:10:10,iczcla,"What no? Lol.
She’s the daughter of Jane Mansfield."
11962,2020-08-20 02:14:32,iczcla,Mariska Hargitay’s mother was Jayne Mansfield.
11963,2020-08-20 02:47:18,iczcla,He already has.
11964,2020-08-20 02:51:02,iczcla,https://i.imgur.com/hSx6LrE.png
11965,2020-08-20 02:46:01,iczcla,He couldn't do that. That would be somewhat politically sensible.
11966,2020-08-20 03:07:08,iczcla,I thought she was about to go deep in on trump. She kinda is.. But shes being nice.
11967,2020-08-20 03:23:15,iczcla,It was a beautiful setting
11968,2020-08-20 03:33:40,iczcla,What is she saying?
11969,2020-08-20 03:31:06,iczcla,"How all living presidents and even non-living, would be so ashamed of the conduct of Donnie T.  She was so passionate, articulate, with controlled anger and clarity of thought."
11970,2020-08-20 03:37:39,iczcla,Remember the Rudy Giuliani interview when he hinted at Comey  open the Clinton email investigation in 2016?
11971,2020-08-20 03:40:26,iczcla,They blew that wad early.
11972,2020-08-20 03:52:31,iczcla,civil or nuclear? 🤔
11973,2020-08-20 04:43:29,iczcla,"The Dems are already sending a f*ck you to GOP by featuring so many black people, why chicken out now?"
11974,2020-08-20 04:48:31,iczcla,"She ‘believed her’ before she decided to change her story twice and accuse him of rape, in public,in the halls of congress."
11975,2020-08-20 06:07:27,iczcla,Democrats have always argued women should be taken seriously and their accusations investigated.  The last two against Biden ended up recanting themselves though. Idk what you expect a prosecutor to do?
11976,2020-08-20 04:32:43,iczcla,I’m also somewhat relieved that we avoided a Republican Congress that was just a mess over prosecuting her.
11977,2020-08-20 12:59:21,iczcla,">Is anyone extra nervous for Biden's speech tomorrow?

Very much so... I like the guy but he isn't the best orator. Obama should've closed out the DNC, although of course he can't."
11978,2020-08-20 07:40:39,iczcla,If you really believed any of this you would have tweeted it.
11979,2020-08-20 12:15:52,iczcla,"A lot of people don't want an actual policy discussion, because it opens Biden up to criticism. Some people just want to hear  ""Biden, f yeah"", instead of an honest evaluation of his positions"
11980,2020-08-20 05:55:21,iczcla,I'd like to assume people just didn't understand my post yesterday and didn't just disagree with wanting more policy discussion.
11981,2020-08-20 01:16:35,iczcla,"I don't know, crackhead turned CEO of scrap might sway this whole election /s"

11984,2020-08-20 01:18:14,iczcla,RNC is proudly sponsored by oleandrin!
11985,2020-08-20 02:19:13,iczcla,"The DNC has a history of fucking over its candidates.

Gore (twice).  Once by smothering his personality and the second with one of Lucifer's minions in Lieberman)

Kerry, making a funny and personable guy seem like Frankenstein.

Hillary (twice). By making her lack passion and giving her the human equivalent of Wonderbread with the VP nom."
11986,2020-08-20 02:08:00,iczcla,Good for her for going on his show. Similar to Bernie speaking at Liberty University. Why isn't there ever an R who speaks in front of a leftish crowd?
11987,2020-08-20 02:14:19,iczcla,Is that available anywhere?
11988,2020-08-20 02:14:48,iczcla,"I saw that one too.  I just shook my head.

She should axe murder her campaign handlers."
11989,2020-08-20 02:16:55,iczcla,"No, brother I wish.

I voted for her anyway.  But man I wasnt at all inspired to do so."
11990,2020-08-20 02:12:06,iczcla,"It would have helped some of the fence sitters.  I held my nose and voted.

The warmth she showed in 10 minutes exceeded her entire campaign.  I dont get it."
11991,2020-08-20 02:26:55,iczcla,"My dog, who hates everyone who isnt me, would have been a better leader.

Literally anyone without an R would have been better.

But yes, Hillary absolutely would have guided us through this crisis far better.  Especially if we got Angry!Hillary."
11992,2020-08-20 02:41:24,iczcla,That's being generous.

12009,2020-08-20 02:20:45,iczcla,Same. I’d love to see her as Treasury Secretary.
12010,2020-08-20 02:26:22,iczcla,Yes it does!
12011,2020-08-20 03:03:38,iczcla,I looked at the TV thinking someone just popped a cap in the studio. Honestly it was startling lol

12017,2020-08-20 03:17:04,iczcla,I'm not interested at in opening up that Senate seat. It took us long enough to get a democrat in there.

12021,2020-08-20 03:38:07,iczcla,It’s usually a pile on when they do. Lemon is the best at it.
12022,2020-08-20 03:41:14,iczcla,dixecrats who haven't actually voted democrat since the 1970's

12024,2020-08-20 03:41:37,iczcla,Yeah and that hasn't ever been a thing. These are the people who just aren't satisfied with frothing on social media.
12025,2020-08-20 03:52:47,iczcla,Black people's stories being told more. \*gasps\*
12026,2020-08-20 03:48:36,iczcla,So you want young white children to be taught the truth now!?!?!?
12027,2020-08-20 04:16:57,iczcla,"The problem seems to be that the Project paints with a very broad brush, and any time you do that you risk trading one picture for a different picture with a new set of flaws and new blind spots. The fear from the right is that we're going to move from teaching that white colonists were all heroes (wrong) to teaching that white colonists were all slavers (also wrong).

That, however, is giving them the benefit of the doubt. In most instances the actual issue is probably just racism, but a broken clock is right twice a day. Personally I think the Project suffers from the same thing everything in post-postmodern media suffers from, namely the bullheaded refusal to accept that there are such things as objectively true facts, and facts don't care how they make anyone look. When one looks at facts it's impossible to conclude that human history can ever be drawn inside precisely ideological lines.

As a boogeyman, it's not a bad one, because unlike a lot of the specters we've seen lately, this one actually has legitimate points of criticism. The unfortunately likely outcome, however, is that if the right blows this up significantly, it will have the effect of preventing real progress on updating American history curricula in the near term, something that's badly needed in order to address the mischaracterization and under-representation of minorities, regardless of how anyone feels about the 1619 Project."
12028,2020-08-20 03:53:26,iczcla,Yes. Tom Cotton has introduced legislation banning federal education funding from schools that teach the 1619 Project.
12029,2020-08-20 05:02:17,iczcla,I'd give half by body for a voice like that.
12030,2020-08-20 05:01:57,iczcla,Right but it hit. Man it hit
12031,2020-08-20 02:06:39,iczcla,"Watch a televangelist one night, a Trump rally another night, Sean Hannity a third night, and, I don't know, those knife infomercials another night. Congratulations, you have now seen the 2020 RNC."
12032,2020-08-20 03:26:39,iczcla,"I mean, there's nothing subpar about her, she's talented as hell. It's just interesting that she really hasn't had any high-profile success as an actress or recording artist since the early days of her career yet she's still managed to stay relevant for over a decade by consistently getting gigs at major events. It's just a very unconventional career path."
12033,2020-08-20 03:35:35,iczcla,Brian Williams would be MSNBC
12034,2020-08-20 03:34:18,iczcla,"MSNBC. Or as Trump calls it, MSDNC."
12035,2020-08-20 03:39:06,iczcla,"It was only about 15 seconds, but was quite jarring. Brian Williams is the consummate newsman, and he went full they believe in a cabal of Satan worshipping cannibals."
12036,2020-08-20 03:12:39,iczcla,"Yep. I was flitting around Bongino, Team Trump, Trump War Room, etc and this was the only new thing being trotted out."
12037,2020-08-20 03:16:24,iczcla,That was closer than he let a black person get in decades.

Which while everyone does, doesn't fit his ""great orator"" tag he always gets. I think some of it shows just how terrible all the others have been at speaking. W came across as a country bumpkin. Clinton always came off as kind of smarmy. HW came off as a stock old, white businessman. Reagan wasn't mentally there for most of his last term.

I also never liked his cadence, but that's a subjective thing, not an objective one like pauses.

12394,2020-08-20 03:18:31,iczcla,I suppose that depends on if Moscow Mitch gets scared enough of his own polling against Amy McGrath that he actually brings a USPS or other election protective Bill or another Covid relief Bill to a vote...
12395,2020-08-20 01:32:46,iczcla,"""Hearing more policy discussed tonight than over the past two days"" does not mean no policies have been discussed. It means that there is a clear focus on policies tonight rather than policies only really discussed within the context of Joe Biden's or Donald Trump's character and humanity (as with the ACA talk, focusing on ""Donald Trump wants to take away your healthcare in a pandemic because he's cruel"")."
12396,2020-08-20 01:31:10,iczcla,"Yes, I have; I watched 2012 and 2016. Both were more substantive policy-wise over the course of the first couple of days than this one has been so far. Yes, there has been some policy talk, but the first two nights primarily focused on discussions of character and temperament (with examples of different ways to address issues) rather than the policies themselves."
12397,2020-08-20 01:29:00,iczcla,"It's a weeklong pep rally with two hours of primetime coverage every night. They can afford to talk policy, friend."
12398,2020-08-20 01:22:01,iczcla,"No, it's not. The first night was focused on ""anti Trump"" arguments that centered mostly around his character and temperment. The second night was focused on Biden's humanity and empathy. Tonight is policy night."

12400,2020-08-20 00:56:51,iczcla,"Yeah, the idea that if you dislike Trump you therefore MUST 100% like CNN is ridiculous. I’ve gotten down voted for criticizing CNN before and I think it’s because people assume that any criticism of CNN = a pro Trump perspective. I’m not pro Trump in the slightest. And I watch CNN a lot, maybe too much. I just think it’s a flawed network in certain respects but overall they do fine work."
12401,2020-08-20 01:37:21,iczcla,"Probably means the girl's dad who votes for Trump because he ""thought [Trump] would protect [them.]""

Which is objectively stupid when Trump literally campaigned on sending undocumented immigrants back."

that didn't work than, it's probably not gonna work this time. Fucking sad, didn't learn your lesson... maybe another 4 years of this shit head in office it might finally sink in"

12423,2020-08-20 05:40:37,iczcla,I’m sure you’re right.  I’ll watch it when I get the chance
12424,2020-08-20 06:59:08,iczcla,"Trump literally got so mad at Obama's speech he immediately flew into an impotent all-caps rage on Twitter.  Like, 5-year old conjugation impotent rage."
12425,2020-08-20 05:24:50,iczcla,"This election isn’t about policy, it’s about whether we’re a democracy at all."
12426,2020-08-20 05:25:53,iczcla,Yes. They would have been great in 1992.

[56% of Biden voters are voting for him because he is not Trump](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/08/13/perceptions-of-trump-and-biden/). 56%!

Meanwhile, Kamala could not even muster one delegate when she was running back in the primaries, which speaks to the lack of a defining policy or set of policies."

12433,2020-08-20 01:55:55,iczcla,This is one of the best speeches she’s done in regards to her stifled speeches before. She is so political but this really does make her soft which is something she struggled with during 2016.
12434,2020-08-20 12:28:41,iczcla,"Go look at the 2016 polls that Trafalgar did in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida, and North Carolina. They nailed all 4, right at the end.

They are *all* dead weight to real tangiable progress at this point. And they endanger all of America."

12441,2020-08-20 03:12:19,iczcla,One can argue those mean the same thing. Not sure if that's what they're talking about though. Be nice if they just said M4A and stopped doing the Moderate dance of Vagueness.
12442,2020-08-20 03:10:54,iczcla,Yeah that's what access means
12443,2020-08-20 03:12:53,iczcla,What do you think they mean by access? Even just tonight they said multiple times that affordability is part of access. If you can't afford it you can't access it.
12444,2020-08-20 03:15:39,iczcla,Affordability is access

They don’t need to keep doing it. Engage the base as well"
12448,2020-08-20 01:07:26,iczcla,Right and Biden isn't promising to nominate pro life judges or be pro life. They are giving up their values to support the fight against authoritarianism.

12454,2020-08-20 03:52:08,iczcla,She had a very warm and presidential vibe.
12455,2020-08-20 03:50:15,iczcla,"I agree I think personally it was her best speech but I think there's something about Kamala that comes across as not genuine...for instance her critique of Biden on busing in the debate (""it hurt me personally because I was a little girl who had to be bused"" and then laughing it off when being vetted by his VP team as ""hey, it was just a debate."" Also her record as AG and DA in Cali and now talking about police reform...not saying her law enforcement bonifides aren't a strength...they'll help pull in Republicans and independents...but I wish she would own her you know what more regardless of the consequences...i don't know that might make it come across as more real...again she's great at making people crumble under questioning"

12462,2020-08-20 01:53:23,iczcla,I was watching it on cable so I found it strange
12463,2020-08-20 03:17:34,iczcla,You need to know what the other side is saying
12464,2020-08-20 03:18:13,iczcla,Kinda wanna see how insane they are right now.
12465,2020-08-20 02:04:05,iczcla,I had no idea she was 80
12466,2020-08-20 03:14:12,iczcla,"I mean, yeah, no one is going to top Obama...expect maybe Michelle Obama (I think she's a better speaker)."
12467,2020-08-20 03:14:55,iczcla,Only person I've seen make a better speech is his wife.
12468,2020-08-20 03:14:05,iczcla,"Yes, it was a joke."
12469,2020-08-20 03:20:25,iczcla,"I mean then don't have Jill Biden and Douglas Emhoff walk in side by side, kind of undercuts it. At least mention that's why it's happening, or don't put them on the same stage at all, or put them in a pod and announce that, or anything other than that silent awkwardness."
12470,2020-08-20 03:21:27,iczcla,"Again, not saying to willy nilly get close to people, but there were so many other options than silently standing on the same stage awkwardly."
12471,2020-08-20 03:24:33,iczcla,"I mean what Trump does with 6 people standing a foot apart on a stage all the time is a bad look. 20 feet apart in silent awkwardness is at best awkward. They could have made a big show of putting on some masks and then did a elbow bump, or if that's too corny at least had mics and talked to each other."
12472,2020-08-20 03:26:28,iczcla,....uh no.... I was suggesting they should... to avoid the appearance of religious preference.
12473,2020-08-20 03:32:46,iczcla,"Yes, they did. A Catholic and an Anglican, I believe. There might have been one other that I missed."

>While this virus touches us at all, we gotta be honest, it's not an equal opportunity offender... Black, Latino, and indigenous people are suffering and dying disproportionately. And this is not a coincidence. It is a result of... the excessive use of force by the police... This virus knows exactly how we see each other and how we treat each other""

Yes, I cut out some things she listed, but I did so to highlight she was listing a bunch of things that were causing disproportionate deaths from coronavirus. When saying ""this is a result of x, y, and z"" then part of that is saying ""this is a result of z"" and frankly what she said was a bizarre statement that made no sense."

Police brutality is overt racism, incompetence, and a failure to prosecute the criminals responsible.  It's a much simpler problem.  Start convicting police for murder and it'll start going away."

They have **zero** policy reasons to entice voters to actually vote for them. It's all about not being Trump. Which is exactly what got us here in the first place. They refused to learn the lessons from 2016 that they should have, and are doubling down with a candidate who I find even more intolerable than Hillary Clinton, who was absolutely bad enough in 2016, but was ""the lesser evil,"" so I, like many others, were compelled to vote for her out of shame and because the Democratic Party has conditioned us to believe, truly, that better things are not possible."

Btw, it's looking like Dems might be on track to lose Minnesota, which... given they were the only state to vote for Mondale over Reagan... is kind of a yikes."

Furthermore, I find it sad, not hilarious, that we're forced to make this awful choice. It's a bad choice to make either way, given that Biden has come out against literally everything the Democratic Party voters support and stand for in favor of corporate donors (pledged to veto M4A if it ever landed on his desk, refused to legalize marijuana because he sees it as a gateway drug, and promised to not ban fracking, and more). It's just that one is obviously much worse."

However if there was enough substance then words alone should be sufficient."

It doesn’t need to be 8 hours long, it feels very disingenuous to me to just hear dramatic music constantly throughout the program, with bits of policy rhetoric scattered it, feels like they have to jazz it up because they lack any real substance to discuss - it dilutes any message."

Ok, my thoughts:

1. Creepy - the way the videos were made, the way everyone was speaking, the eerie nature of it all. They were using some dystopian babble language, nothing really meant ANYTHING, no talk of substance or anything approaching it, just general terms like ""restore dignity to women"" or ""us winning will prove that black lives matter"" vague rubbish like that. The way Hillary was speaking was super creepy too, like an alien trying to communicate as a human. 

2. Cringey - the hypocrisy and idiocy of it all. Saying they're the party of black rights and evoking MLK etc when they're running two candidates who have TERRIBLE records on policing and black rights issues. Like, why is nobody discussing this? It's insane. Kamala Harris is NOT a great candidate to put forward to deal with police brutality, she's the opposite.

Again, the Dems are running two hard ass conservative law and order type candidates, relying on an outdated 20 year old strategy of appealing to reasonable Republicans. They're, again, tone deaf and ignorant to the realities of America, because this is all a circus to distract everybody enough so that they can take power and continue to boost the corporate elite at the expense of the lower classes.

 That's what they've always done. That's why Sanders COULDN'T win. That's why the news was 24/7 ""Sanders is a communist"" ""Sanders loves Cuba and wants us to be like them"" ""Sanders is sexist"" etc etc, as someone who's got a degree in this field it's HILARIOUS seeing the media run literal propaganda 24/7 on behalf of the establishment Dems and barely anyone calling it out, if you do you're a Republican operative or something.

The mainstream Democratic party has lost its damn mind, and it's frankly embarrassing to watch if you don't just blindly clap along to the nice words.

This is why the gap is genuinely closing between Biden and Trump, and I fully expect to see it as a tight race come election night, and my suspicion is that Trump will win again, narrowly. This is because the Dems are stuck in a Groundhog Day type election loop, and it's gonna cost them. Already polls are showing that the swing states are nearing a tie, and all that orange idiot has to do is win enough swing states and boom he's president again."

12682,2020-08-20 05:09:28,iczcla,">If you live in Wyoming, you're apparently up to 5x more valuable than if you live in LA or NYC

This is only a slight exaggeration.

Wyoming is the least populous state and has 3 electoral college votes. California is the most populous state and has 53 electoral college votes.

Wyoming's population is estimated to be about 579,000 (in 2019). This means Wyoming gets one electoral college vote for every 193,000 people.

California's population is estimated to be about 39,512,000 (in 2019). This means California gets one electoral college vote for every 745,509 people.

That is a difference of 552,509 people (equal to a little over 95% of the population of Wyoming) for each electoral college vote. Each vote cast for President in Wyoming is 'worth' about 3.86 votes cast in California. Or, put another way, each vote cast in California is worth only about **25.89%** of a vote cast in Wyoming.

Edit: Why? Because the number of electoral college votes is equal to the size of a state's congressional delegation and the number of seats in the House of Representatives has been capped at 435 since **1911** (with only a brief increase to 437).

Edit 2: How do we fix it? We institute the [Wyoming Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming_Rule) (setting the representative-to-population ratio to that of the state with the lowest population) and increase the size of the House of Representatives by about 200 members so that it is [about equal to the cube root of the population](http://statchatva.org/files/2018/11/Cube-Root-2.jpg) ."
12683,2020-08-20 14:47:58,iczcla,"Makes sense for Senate representation, but I think it’s past time the President was determined by popular vote, or at least reapportion the fucking House correctly to prevent gerrymandering and make sure the popular vote more closely aligns to the electoral college."
12684,2020-08-20 10:38:00,iczcla," In a another extreme, you could have only 1 person vote in each of the top 11 EV states and all for the same candidate and then have 100 millionish people in the remaining states all vote for the other candidate. This totals to 270 EVs exactly and the person with 11 votes would win. Both scenarios are implausible extremes, but highlight from different directions how the electoral college is a failure if the goal is representative/democratic outcomes."
12685,2020-08-20 04:28:55,iczcla,">If Trump gets a second term, you can kiss ANY progressive desires goodbye. He won't even stop at two terms. He's said as much, several times now.

I think we've all heard, ""No, *this* is the most important election"" so many times that it can't even register for some people when it's like, ""no, really, for *real*, this is the do-or-die one.""

I can't see a real civil war going down (What are the goals? The terms? The strategies and tactics? Do you go out and look for yard signs and kick the people in the nuts? Do we have to carry a card? How do we know when it's done?) but at least for the three months after the election, I see a lot of very public conflict going down in violent destructive ways because the stakes are high, and presented at least as high as they actually are.

The people that aren't culty are still thinking an entire way of life will change in a short period of time, and people react poorly to perceived threats like that. People cling to structure; that's part of why it's called structure."

In one poll (I think it was the ONLY one that had Trump ahead by 1 or 2 pts), that was a poll that incl. Jill Stein, who had 2 pts in that poll. I looked at I think 12 or 13 polls before & after Comey Surprise...up to election (to the extent that those same polls cont'd polling). All but one had Clinton ahead. Most were w/in MOE, true. But do you know the odds of that many polls being wrong? It'd never happened before, since we've been polling for the election. There was no sign of Trump momentum."
12729,2020-08-20 23:25:31,iczcla,"I know. But I looked at the polls myself (I have them, if you want me to post them) & compared polls before & after Comey October Surprise to after, leading to election. No effect. In fact, one poll she went UP after. I tried to compare a specific poll before & after, not compare one by, say, CNN, before, and then one by Rasmussen after. That's why when Trump won, I immediately thought Russia had hacked just a few purple districts. NEVER BEFORE had a candidate won when almost all polls had the opponent winning. (I think 12 polls showed Clinton ahead right before election, and 1 had Trump leading). I knew it wasn't Comey. I think the people were numb about the email so-called scandal, hence they didn't react much to it."

But the Supreme Court and lower courts appointments would be better and more balanced, and the purges and takeovers within our government agencies like with the justice department and environmental and education agencies wouldn’t have  happened. 

Trump has purged and appointed loyalists to HIM in major positions of power within these agencies.
Everything within the foundation of our government including the principles it was founded on is at risk under trump and his cronies.

However, I do think there has also been a large push to excite voters who otherwise might not come out. Black and brown women are a big part of that wave of excitement. Last I read the most loyal demographic to the Democrats was college educated black women."

In the 70s. Carter was sadly too good of a man to make a good president. And Americans were just aghast at being told to buckle down.

And some light treason for the election from Reagan didn't help.

Speaking of which, have any of the Dem presidents ever been actually accused of actual treason? We have 3-4 GOP ones in recent history. Nixon negotiated to extend Vietnam to help his election. Reagan talked to Iran to keep the hostages from being freed to keep Carter from getting a bump. W had his war crimes. And well, Trump and Russia.

That literally only means Ford and HW haven't committed known treason for all the GOP since 1969. And HW was head of the CIA, so who knows what skeletons he's had."

Obviously not every mass shooter is white, straight, etc., and not every entitled white boy becomes a mass shooter when their desires are thwarted. Most of them just make up dumb theories about evolutionary biology on the internet. But there will always be a tiny percentage who decide the whole world needs to be punished for denying them the things they know they ""deserve."" And it's just far more likely to be raised with this poisonous idea (that you deserve everything you want just for existing) if you are an (at least middle class) straight white male. 

Interestingly there have actually been studies done that show that mass shootings can be correlated to communities with the highest levels of income inequality: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6199901/"
12934,2020-08-20 01:38:27,iczcla,"Not who you replied to but heres my quick answer to both the things you brought up:


A) Only white kids get the ""glory"" from acts such as these if a black kid shoots up a school it gets whitewashed away as probably a gang thing


B) Relevantly black crime is higher because they're the ones in control of the modern day mafia. In the 20s-30s it was Irish bootleggers, then the mafia took over the drug trade after prohibition ended. Years later the mafias largely disbanded and the drug trade is run by gangs in the black community. The violence in gang wars is often just territory struggles to maintain profits for their given gangs. 


In the US there will always be illegal things which need sold because there is a market for them, we used to say the Irish were just criminal drunkards because of bootleggers much like we say black people are druggie gang members now. 


It's all about perspective, the reason you struggled with the school shootings is it doesn't sound like something that could ever be part of your reality, but bad news crazy white kids that get picked on isn't exactly a new demographic. You probably knew a kid in high school who would later go on to commit suicide because they were bullied.  Nowadays a couple of those same kids commit suicide by cop and take their bullies with them in the process. Its been that way since Columbine, some 20 years ago."

And when you're enlisted as a way to earn your citizenship, you don't expect someone to take your wife from your military home, away from the child she is looking after while you serve and earn your place in America.

Before Trump, I would have thought it unthinkable. In the military, spouses are almost as sacred as the soldiers. You just don't fuck with them. It's a force readiness issue. Your family is supposed to be taken care of by your fellow soldiers' families and by those remaining at home with them. 

It just doesn't enter the realm of possibility in your mind that a soldier's wife and mother to their child would be kicked out of the country. That is, until it did."

Here: I've bolded the main point and numbered the sub-examples below.

13065,2020-08-20 06:51:06,iczcla,"Biden performed poorly in Iowa, catastrophically in New Hampshire, and got a distant second in Nevada. Sanders was in the lead with a consistent first or barely second place finishing, and the frontrunning moderate was Buttigieg, who the rest of the party was starting to rally around.  The media, and this sub, were largely dismissing Biden as a weak, unfocused candidate.  The most optimistic they were about Biden was that he might still manage to hold a base in the South, maybe, but Bloomberg and Steyer were making that a challenge.

Then Biden won every single county in South Carolina, utterly demolishing everyone else and nearly taking half the entire vote singlehandedly.  The other moderates saw they didn't stand a chance if they kept competing against each other, and dropped out and endorsed Biden.  Super Tuesday only solidified what was already happening.

That didn't happen because the narrative preemptively selected him, that happened because the people chose him with their own will.  The Biden unity narrative that emerged afterward is something that was dictated by the people of South Carolina, not the DNC itself.  That wasn't rigged, that was democracy."

She has almost done a complete 180 as a Senator in her polices towards drugs and abortion rights. She has also shown she can be more progressive in criminal justice than previously. How is changing your stance worse than doubling down? Wouldn’t you trust someone more if they were willing to change their positions on an issue? Especially if it would show how bad the previous position was but they changed anyway. 

It’s bad when a politician makes a mistake but it is absolutely worse when they won’t change to try and fix it. Flip flopping isn’t bad when you are making a better choice.

Do you mean when speaking/on video, like he seems like he's thorough in intent but not broadcasting it properly, or do you mean more like, all the positions/plan stuff on the site doesn't go far enough to delineate how that will be tackled, or paid for, or anything else like that?

(Maybe you don't mean either of those things, of course...I am genuinely asking...to me it presents like it's substantive because it's specific and seems like it tries to cover a lot of bases, but -- again, to *me* -- also seems like a lot of wishful thinking and seeing what can be afforded and what might stick, like of all the things he'd *want* to do, given all the other steps in the way of it all being implemented, what could survive to see the light of day, etc...)

It was so carefully stated but presented like it was a free and original thought in the moment.

When he was staring down the camera at the end, I had to blink myself back into awareness because it was like being spoken to personally, like something in his tone said, ""Yeah, I get it, you don't agree with everything I say and do, and I know how it looks and we all know we have different motivations and blah blah blah...but listen...shit's about to get real."" And the fact that he was talking to millions of people, and to an inanimate object to do it? Most of the people I know can't do that in a one-on-one conversation.

It was so deliberate but came across so honestly. And it's all about persuasion. So good job, man. That was really, really respectable.

Even though I was right leaning, I was willing at the time to vote for candidates like Kaine and Warner who I felt had ""proven"" themselves. That made it really easy to transition, because even though I leaned right the only candidates I really supported happened to be Democrats.

13215,2020-08-20 05:03:02,iczcla,She never accused him of racism. She actually said ‘I don’t think you are a racist’ during that moment in the debate. She never disputed that he opposed segregation his whole life. She was arguing that his lack of support for bussing in the 70s was wrong. Bussing was a controversial practice where black kids were out on busses and driven to white school districts and white kids out on busses to black districts. It was controversial because it created a lot of animosity and was opposed by most white and black people at the time. Of course in retrospect it looks bad to have opposed bussing.

As for the ""sexual predator"", he just isn't. Reade's allegations have been torn apart and debunked as much as is possible unless/until she comes out and admits it was fake. The only other assault allegation has been [disproven concretely](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dinner-organizer-says-biden-was-not-at-event-where-alleged-sexual-harassment).

13272,2020-08-20 03:42:24,iczcla,"Worse, tonight's convention coverage was horrific.  Truly hoped Kamala could harness the trump hate and bring it home, but her tepid, cliche-ridden, and utterly uninspiring acceptance speech coupled with the anti-gun rhetoric from children who've never held a firearm, teary-eyed sob stories from illegal aliens who've sucked healthcare dollars and ""special needs"" bennies for an entire generation without even bothering to learn the language, and cynical pandering to a demographic guaranteed to stay home in droves come Nov.3, left me bereft of optimism for the outcome of the coming election.  

That the sync was off by at least 3 seconds throughout didn't help a whole lot either. 

At least Jennifer Hudson was able to blow the roof off the Capitol Rotunda in the closing segment. Now *that* much needed dose of authenticity was almost worth the 2.5 hours of my life I invested in this cringe-worthy shitshow.

She doesn't say ""structural racism is"", but rather says ""excessive coronavirus deaths is the effect of x; of y; of z."". She's still talking about it in the context of coronavirus causing excessive deaths for minorities, and even if she was defining structural racism, which I don't think she was, it still doesn't make sense there since she's laying coronavirus deaths onto excessive police force causing disproportionate coronavirus deaths in minorites."
13301,2020-08-20 05:37:26,iczcla,We see police wildly abusing their powers even in wealthier areas right now indicating it's probably more intentional by police than we would like to believe.

For example, Trump's border wall didn't pass, and they had both chambers. Yes they didn't have 60 in the Senate, but they refused to make the deals necessary to get it passed, ie. passing the DREAM Act - because such a compromise would have been seen as amnesty by their white nationalist base who would have absolutely revolted.

Btw, the platform quietly removed any mention of curbing fossil fuel usage, so that tells you where their priorities are on climate change."

13306,2020-08-20 05:39:18,iczcla,"Polling shows Trump and Biden are tied 47-47, with Jo Jorgensen nearing the 5% threshold (which honestly holds Trump back from winning handily seeing how the Libertarian Party is actually to the right of the Republicans - they're just much less authoritarian and don't stand for any actual values). To me, a statistical tie with Biden ahead would make Trump the slight favorite to win, while an actual tie in polling would imply that Trump would be on track to win quite handily, just due to a trend of polls typically undercounting conservative voters, either because the samples they select are somewhat skewed in Dems' favor or because Trump voters are embarrassed, but nevertheless privately committed and don't want to admit it like in 2016."

Do you know why Bernie polled consistently better than Biden against Trump, despite being a self-avowed socialist? Because he did exactly what I just described.

Maybe it's because it was the first day on this new format, but the 1st day seemed to have a telethon vibe. But Bernie Sanders and Michele Obama pulled through to make it an enjoyable show.

The second day was definitely an improvement. You had like a mini documentary on Jill Biden and her relationship, and the roll call vote was great.

The third day was even better, and the most convention-like one so far, with a focus on the policy vision of Biden and Harris. Segments on gun violence, immigration, climate change, and especially women's rights, with Elizabeth Warren, Hillary Clinton, and Kamala Harris all giving powerful speeches. And, of course, one of President Barack Obama's best speeches ever.

I'm really looking forward to tomorrow. I don't know how they will top day 3, but I'm waiting for it.

Edit: it took a while, but day 4 proved to be the best day of the Convention. Biden just gave his best speech ever."

The dumbest shit Democrats can do is actually state that they want to take away guns. Especially when we scare people with assault rifles while handguns are the overwhelming majority of gun deaths."

I am totally against this growing number of Democrats saying that they are making amends and we should welcome them to the big tent. Too many comments here and pundits in the wild are treating it like they have come to their senses and will help make this nation better. And we all need to remember that they were the Frankenstein and Trump is their monster. And when this is over they are just going back to making a better monster. That is what I am arguing against. 

People want normalcy so bad that they are getting more and more comfortable with glossing over their evils too. That's my concern. More people tune in and out of politics. And if we are having conversations about the great deeds of people like members of the Lincoln Project right now that's all people will remember when they have tuned back out again. 

So when we speak about these temporarily reformed monsters, do not fail to also highlight their role in creating this mess."

Nothing scared the DNC more than a candidate they can’t control.  So Bernie, Tulsi, and Warren had to be axed.  

It’s been a sham from the get go.  The DNC doesn’t even really like Biden but he has a name and is an empty vessel for them to put a platform in until they replace him for “medical” reasons.  Harris is a younger more colorful empty vessel.   She has no policy values, she will read whatever her handlers put on the teleprompter.   They are lapdogs to those behind the scenes.

The end result of this election is the rich donors get what they want and none of the actual platform issues of the people voting will ever make it across the desk to be signed into law."

That’s why Biden is the nominee rather than someone with more advanced ideas. Making those big changes to make society more fair has to take into account how easily scared of change most people generally are. Do too much at once and people will run right back over to the right, who are more than happy to reassure them that they’re going to fix things and make it 1955 America again. I think Biden will right this keeling-over ship but he’s not going to do anything to make it a truly better ship.

You would have to evidence that Biden was fully aware of the consequences of the war in Iraq. That's easy to say with 20/20 hindsight, but I'd say if you were to substitute an average American for Biden in that situation they would have no further grasp on the number of deaths involved.

> Funny so when Biden was VP under Obama I assume you'd blame him for all those drone deaths and bombing hospitals. 

Obama made the calls on drone striking places. Biden didn't.

Now, Cheney did make the call on falsifying evidence. Therefore, Cheney is responsible. It is what we might describe as a non-analogous situation.

> Do you mind telling me who won the Iowa caucus? 

Yeah, that's not evidence of rigging. Winning Iowa doesn't indicate that you will win the primary. It's a general indicator, but not a guarantee; Ted Cruz won 2016 Iowa and didn't win the nomination.

> Oh you mean like closing down polling locations in poor neighborhoods? 

Yes, that would be an example. However, most of the states where that has occurred are Republican or governed by Republicans; that's not necessarily or directly under the DNC's control.

Not by Biden. But it has been debunked in numerous other ways. Hell, even just on the document you're referencing, the supposed ""complaint"" she filed, [she herself has waffled and now said it doesn't complain about any harassment or assault](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/biden-accuser-tara-reade-not-sure-what-complaint-she-claims-n1198741). So even if it was produced it wouldn't back up her latest claim. [Reade herself said that the document would be in the National Archives](https://twitter.com/ReadeAlexandra/status/1220047849276076032), until Biden called her bluff, and now she claims it's in some other random archive it'd have no reason to be in.

>You are such a liar, holy hell. It was never debunked Reade said she would be willing to go under cross examination, a polygraph test and testify under oath. If she was lying she could go to jail, it is not a joke.

I'm not lying, it has been debunked as much as any such accusation can be. You really think that anyone would put the accuser of one of the most public politicians in the country in jail? Give me a break.

The location of the assault has been debunked:
>A recent walk through that area showed the subway tunnel contains no out-of-view areas, like an alcove. The remaining portion of the route includes multiple stairwells as well as corridors lined with offices. It is a main thoroughfare for senators and staffers.

>Some former staffers told the NewsHour that if Biden did assault Reade in any of these places, it would have been a brazen attack in an area with a high risk of being seen.

By all means, point out to me where I said that. He isn't responsible for actions that he didn't take or order, as Cheney did. He made a bad call on Iraq; I'm just not convinced it made him a horrible person because I know good people who would have made the same call after 9/11.

Incidentally, it's relevant to talk about Cheney because if we're assigning blame for the Iraq War, the guy who knew it was bullshit at the time and argued persuasively for it gets markedly more than a guy who was lied to.

13626,2020-08-20 18:27:47,iczcla,"> Nope. Location has never been debunked.

Yes it has. [People have gone to the alleged location and there is no place anyone could be out of the way to assault someone without witnesses](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/what-74-former-biden-staffers-think-about-tara-reades-allegations). Her claim that a busy hallway is ""semi-private"" is nonsense.

""A recent walk through that area showed the subway tunnel contains no out-of-view areas, like an alcove. The remaining portion of the route includes multiple stairwells as well as corridors lined with offices. It is a main thoroughfare for senators and staffers.

Some former staffers told the NewsHour that if Biden did assault Reade in any of these places, it would have been a brazen attack in an area with a high risk of being seen.""

>Her neighbor, whole she told the full story to many years ago backs her up fully.

[After backing up her *original* story that didn't include assault, fully](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/05/tara-reade-joe-biden-allegation-reporting-vox-pbs-doubts.html). Her original ""backing up"" was ""it wasn’t that bad. [Biden] never tried to kiss her directly. He never went for one of those touche"", until all of a sudden she's backing up the new assault claim. Same with her brother.

>Nope. This was just a lie.

No? What do you mean? How can you say it's a lie when her story *has* changed? Her original claim didn't even include an assault. Check your own wikipedia article, it has a whole section on ""previous allegations"".

>More lies. She didn't tell people the full story at first, and then she did. That's all. A very normal fact pattern for someone with a difficult accusation. 

Her changing of the story does **not** follow the normal pattern for assault victims and it's disgusting of you and hurtful to real victims to try to conflate them. Her accusation didn't become more open and honest as things went on, it changed in response to new information disproving parts of the previous allegations.

>Also she DID tell her neighbor the whole thing years ago.

Again, no. The claim her neighbor backs up has changed along with her accusation.

>She absolutely did file it.

Really? I'd check your own wiki link: ""Reade has said she filed a complaint with a congressional personnel office, but that it does not mention sexual assault, or the phrase ""sexual harassment"". Instead, she used the words ""uncomfortable"" and ""retaliation"".

Nothing filed about harassment or assault. And she has since [waffled on what the alleged complaint actually contains](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/biden-accuser-tara-reade-not-sure-what-complaint-she-claims-n1198741), and even [whether it was an actual complaint](https://twitter.com/marykbruce/status/1256197317235027968).

>The Biden camp has made false statements about where such a complaint might be, and are refusing to look where the complaint likely is.

Bullshit. Reade is the one that invented that personnel files would be in Biden's private archives when there is zero reason to believe they would be. [Even Reade herself believed it was in the National Archives](https://twitter.com/ReadeAlexandra/status/1220047849276076032), until Biden called her bluff and asked for them to be released. Then all of a sudden it's in this other unrelated archive it would have no reason to be in.

> One, I have not heard any estimates of how many young American men and  women might die in such a war or how many tens of thousands of women and  children in Iraq might also be killed. As a  caring Nation, we should do everything we can to prevent the horrible  suffering that a war will cause.  

Tens of thousands was Bernie's estimate back in 2003. He was one of the most pessimistic about the war at the time. He didn't estimate hundreds of thousands. No one estimated hundreds of thousands. No one expected us to be there as long as we were. The previous Gulf War ended in less than 6 months. That would have been a better estimate based on what we knew at the time. Vietnam isn't an appropriate comparison there.

Frankly, I'm not particularly interested in your opinion on these people. I know them; you don't; you seem to think of principle as a club to beat people down with if they disagree with your opinions in any regard. They are good people. I'm not changing what I think of them based on the opinion of a random Internet stranger.

> My friend, the ballots are online people in their own free time counted  them. Bernie won Pete was 2nd, the DNC tried to stop his momentum at  every turn. 

Okay, so what you're telling me is that the Iowa caucus had a victor who was not the final winner, and that it doesn't prove election rigging if the winner of the Iowa caucus is not the ultimate winner of the election.

That is the point. I may have been a little jerkish to establish it, but it's fucking irrelevant who won the Iowa caucus. It doesn't prove election rigging, and it doesn't matter.

 AIPAC is based in America and run by Americans. That's not ""foreign rigging"". After all that, you're citing a super PAC within the United States as your example of ""foreign rigging""? Fuck's sake."

Not counting votes properly could involve a number of things, none of which are election rigging. Incompetence appears to be the strongest evidence for the case you're describing. 

No, you're fucking kidding me. Your example of foreign rigging is an AMERICAN LOBBYING COMPANY. Lobbying on behalf of Israel, yes, but still a group of Americans using American money to pay for American ads. That's what you're calling foreign rigging. When we have companies taking five million dollars from Russia. And Russia organizing rallies for a candidate without saying they're Russian. And Russia hacking voter information. Your example of foreign election interference is an American lobbying company.

In case this isn't clear, I'll repeat it. **Your example of foreign election interference is an American lobbying company.** 

You said Israel dumped 6 figures into supporting certain candidates. AIPAC did. AIPAC has not been accused of taking Israeli funding. 

So your claim about foreign interference in elections is just... wrong. It's completely off the mark."

As First Lady of the United States of America—the first African American to serve in that role—she helped create the most welcoming and inclusive White House in history, while also establishing herself as a powerful advocate for women and girls in the U.S. and around the world, dramatically changing the ways that families pursue healthier and more active lives, and standing with her husband as he led America through some of its most harrowing moments. Along the way, she showed us a few dance moves, crushed Carpool Karaoke, and raised two down-to-earth daughters under an unforgiving media glare.  In her memoir, a work of deep reflection and mesmerizing storytelling, Michelle Obama invites readers into her world, chronicling the experiences that have shaped her—from her childhood on the South Side of Chicago to her years as an executive balancing the demands of motherhood and work, to her time spent at the world’s most famous address. With unerring honesty and lively wit, she describes her triumphs and her disappointments, both public and private, telling her full story as she has lived it—in her own words and on her own terms. Warm, wise, and revelatory, Becoming is the deeply personal reckoning of a woman of soul and substance who has steadily defied expectations—and whose story inspires us to do the same."

13770,2020-09-04 20:27:24,imnm7c,"Hello, is this Pizza Hut?

Excellent. My name is Ben Shapiro. Conservative thought leader. Prominent white YouTuber. The Muggsy Bogues of the intellectual dark Web. And—look, it’s just a fact—I would like to order some pizza pie. If you are triggered by that request, I do not care. I truly do not.

Now let’s discuss conditions. First, thank you for agreeing to debate me. Typically, in fora such as this, I am met with ad-hominem mudslinging, anything from “You racist creep” or “Is that your real voice?” to raucous schoolyard laughter and threats of the dreaded “toilet swirly.” However, your willingness to engage with me over the phone on the subject of pizza shows an intellectual fortitude and openness to dangerous ideas which reflects highly on your character. Huzzah, good sir. Huzzah.

Second, any pizza I order will be male. None of this “Our pizza identifies as trans-fluid-pan-poly”—no. Pizza is a boy. With a penis. It’s that simple. It’s been true for all of human history, from Plato to Socrates to Mr. Mistoffelees, and any attempt to rewrite the pillars of Western thought will be met with a hearty “Fuh!” by yours truly. And, trust me, that is not a fate you wish to meet.

Now. With regard to my topping preference. I have eaten from your pizzeria in times past, and it must be said: your pepperoni is embarrassingly spicy. Frankly, it boggles the mind. I mean, what kind of drugs are you inhaling over there? Pot?! One bite of that stuff and I had to take a shower. So tread lightly when it comes to spice, my good man. You do not want to see me at my most epic. Like the great white hero of Zack Snyder’s classic film “300,” I will kick you.

Onions, peppers—no, thank you. If I wanted veggies, I’d go to a salad bar. I’m not some sort of vegan, Cory Booker weirdo. And your efforts to Michelle Obama-ize the great American pizza pie are, frankly, hilarious. Though not as funny as the impressively named P’Zone—when I finally figured out that genuinely creative pun, I laughed until I cried and peed. A true Spartan admits defeat, and I must admit that, in this instance, your Hut humor slayed me, Dennis Miller style.

And, with that, you have earned my order. Congratulations. Ahem. Without further ado, I would like your smallest child pizza, no sauce, extra cheese. Hello? Aha. A hang-up. Another triggered lib, bested by logic. Damn it. I’m fucking starving."

Ever. For example, Epstein is still alive...he’s actually just scheduled to be executed in front of many of his victims. Let that truth ring out, let the consequences be known. When people tell you to comply sexually in exchange for an opportunity or money, that’s quid pro quo and there are charges for that. Furthermore, if you are raping, sacrificing, torturing, and literally consuming humans. You are going to die very awfully. There are crimes that make Harvey’s crimes seem like a high five. It shouldn’t matter what you own or who you can buy. The law applies to everyone, that’s the point. And we can’t even report on anything that isn’t a fabricated story for the goal of protecting said people‘s “rights.” Ur rights to protecting yourself from defamation end when you do a crime. Amiright?"

The first publicly known allegations were made in 2017 and this event was held when Michelle was still in the White House (so pre-2016). The whole Weinstein story is remarkable because he used to be respected for his legacy while he abused his power. If he wasn't famous and a ""legend"" in his industry, he would be just another rapist and not even make headlines. Michelle was deceived like most people were, don't see how this is a conspiracy."

Trump hired Acosta for labor secretary and Dershowitz for impeachment literally both sides who helped Epstein get his sweetheart deal.

Trump partied with Epstein for 15 years+ and gave him free VIP membership to Mar-A-Lago for most of it. If he kicked him out of his hotels for shady dealings with minors and didn’t immediately called the cops then he’s complicit. Which we know he didn’t.

13954,2020-09-05 02:50:13,imhxii,"I don’t really care whether Trump flew on the plane or not - nor do I feel like Clinton and others having done so somehow changes the fact that Trump absolutely partied with Epstein and Maxwell - he knew them and knew about their disgusting lifestyles - and yet he hired Acosta and Dershowitz after their own involvement with Epstein - and recently sent well-wishes to Maxwell in contrast to the many women he’s called “nasty”.

Let’s not forget him bragging about being able to walk in on underage beauty pageant contestants changing, too.

You can put Trump, Clinton, Dershowitz and Acosta all in the same cell for all I care, fucking creeps, the lot of them."

So, unless she had a surrogate, this means nothing. So she prob had a surrogate.

But all of the women I’ve read about continued relationships with him for personal gain and didn’t decide he raped them until years later. They aren’t naive children who don’t understand sex or rape, I feel like there should be personal accountability for someone who agrees to be sexually assaulted or have sex with someone they don’t want to for financial gain and career progression , and then regret it later and decide to prosecute years later. 

It’s not in the same ballpark in my mind as the true horrific rapes that happen in the world and certainly not sexually assaulting children."
14005,2020-09-04 17:39:51,imhxii,"Good point. Just knowing how much child trafficking information goes on in this sub, it seemed like a comparison was trying to be drawn between that and Weinstein, and it doesn’t really exist. Especially when you start talking about children, when no children were victims. The existence of this topic here in this sub is a political hit piece. Your comment makes sense tho"

Say bad things about Obama and prove me wrong? Actually fuck Obama, say bad things about the entire democrat party. Here, I’ll start with my party.

Republicans are annoyingly religious, bootlickers, and their economics are trash. They were also somewhat responsible for 9/11 (I say somewhat because idk if it was just the republicans or if it was a bi partisan deep state entity that was responsible) 

Your turn. Shit on your party."

14051,2020-09-04 15:21:04,imhsn8,Pretty slim. They vote third-party before they vote Democrat.
14052,2020-09-04 15:24:09,imhsn8,About zero.  It’s kinda crazy here how fast the Mormon community turned on Romney once he started being outspoken about Bunker Baby’s failures and voting to remove from office.

1) she was a a respected professional woman in her own right, and was arguably more accomplished than her husband before he went into politics

2) as a working mother, she seems to have done a pretty good job with her kids

3) her fashion was classic, but accessible to most middle income moms- compared and contrast w Jackie Kennedy or the current First Lady

4) her signature initiative- healthier school lunches- was a pretty well regarded one, and was effective in what it set out to do, prior to the Trump reversals.

5) She's got a sense of humor. Seriously, compare this to the competition

6) She's been very open about both her personal struggles and those of her family, in a way that is unprecedented, and people respond favorably to a powerful person showing that level of vulnerability 

You seem to be under the impression that a First Lady has to 'accomplish' a lot while her husband is in office. That's not the case. But even if Michelle had never set foot in the white house, she's successful by every metric you could name, and to be admired, even if you disagree with her politics."

But in all seriousness, she probably did more using her platform than our current First Lady has done.

She’s not an elected official so I don’t pay much attention to whatever cause these people take up as a hobby"

14076,2020-09-05 18:02:04,imgckz,"OP you should probably ask this question in a liberal sub.  Also, you are limiting “accomplishments” to politics.  There are many avenues in life that makes a person accomplished beyond politics.  People do look up to her as a role model but they probably have many role models.  I know I do."
14077,2020-09-04 14:22:26,imgckz,Idk how true this is but I heard she made the public schools food taste like shit. I tried my son food day and even I was like damn that’s bad. Ain’t like how it was when I was a kid with the rectangular pizzas and cheese sticks lol
14078,2020-09-04 14:40:33,imgckz,"The first lady’s job is to fuck the president, and that’s all. They didn’t get elected, so like a good spouse (not trying to use the old “women belong in kitchen” joke) they should shut the fuck up. The best First Lady in recent memory was W’s wife; because no one remembers her name. Ex. Nancy Reagan pushed war on drugs, Hillary is a serial killer, Michelle Obama got so popular for no reason that she will eventually hold office for something, and Melania is doing what she should, stand there and smile. W’s wife however, was so irrelevant that I cannot recall her name and neither can many others."
14079,2020-09-04 14:52:41,imgckz,"Thanks for taking your time to discuss this. I just think that there are other women that have power who should be considered role models. Angela Merkel, Margaret thatcher, Theresa may are some examples. I’m a moderate there are some policies that I liked and some I didn’t."
14080,2020-09-04 14:51:24,imgckz,"#4 had all the best intentions, but is a disaster. The amount of food that gets thrown away is ridiculous. Kids must take the food, even if they will not eat it. The trash cans are full of untouched fruits and vegetables our tax dollars paid for. 

While I agree that a push for whole grains and fresh fruit/vegetables is important, I also believe that the most important part of the kids dietary intake is the protein that is served. The meats that they serve at school are heavily processed and taste like grade A dog shit.

I teach in a public school and it makes me angry to see the food waste that happens every day."

14082,2020-09-04 13:59:20,imgckz,Yeah they kinda do. Ik a bunch of liberals that say she’s inspiring and a role model. But what has she actually done
14083,2020-09-04 14:24:30,imgckz,"I’m not afraid of her, I just what to know what she accomplished. I think Angela Merkel is a better role model, she’s actually done a lot. Why don’t you tell me some facts about what she’s accomplished instead of insinuating that I’m afraid of her. I’ll wait"
14084,2020-09-04 14:06:41,imgckz,"She kind of failed as a first Lady. I mean, that much opportunity and what did she do? Remove coca cola from schools?"
14085,2020-09-04 14:30:30,imgckz,"So she’s a role model because she got married to someone? I can bring attention to issues too, it’s not a big deal. Now if she’d actually done something to better those issues would be a different topic."
14086,2020-09-04 15:22:57,imgckz,Says “ Not trying to use the old women belong in the kitchen joke” Immediately says women belong in the kitchen and/or on their backs.

14088,2020-09-04 14:57:36,imgckz,"None of your examples are American, so I don't think they'd serve as role models for Americans, even if I agreed with their politics, which I don't. But you are right, by that metric, Nancy Pelosi is a more admirable woman than Obama, but they essentially fill different niches, culturally.

Michelle Obama has excelled at things Americans consider part of 'womanhood,' while also being an accomplished professional. Which is a shitty double standard women have to deal with, but there you have it."

>Margaret thatcher,

Is this a joke?"
14090,2020-09-04 15:00:02,imgckz,"Hey, settle down, no need for the giant bold font.

I agree that food waste sucks. But it was expected, since this was part of a social norming campaign to get kids to consider healthier food. the question is whether, on balance, it moves kids to better food decisions when the food isn't provided.

School lunches have a lot of functions- most notably as price stabilization for the Ag industry. But balancing the nutritional load is hard, especially considering it may be the only meal some kids get."

14094,2020-09-04 15:46:11,imgckz,"Yeah, stupid to try to address the obesity epidemic in the US by attempting to instill better eating/exercise habits in children.  I wish she would have gone the Nancy Reagan route and helped wage the War on Drugs and demonize people with HIV. 

That came off way snarkier than I meant it.  Just because a First Lady is ""successful"" in implementing their chosen agenda, doesn't necessarily mean it's a good thing."
14095,2020-09-04 14:35:12,imgckz,Whether or not she failed is your for debate. But I do appreciate her trying to do good at least.

14097,2020-09-04 15:51:07,imgckz,"I added that to stress that it would be the same with a lady president and a “first man”. If the husband wasn’t elected, why the fuck should he be speaking?"
14098,2020-09-05 20:33:37,imgckz,Please explain how what I said was anti woman in any way? I said the spouse Of the president should just stand there because they weren’t elected. That goes for a female president as well. I also specifically pointed that out.
14099,2020-09-04 15:07:00,imgckz,"I agree Nancy pelosi is a good role model. There’s also Condoleezza rice who I think would be a better role model. There’s Ursula burns, Mary Barr’s, Indra Nooyi and so many more female ceos of large corporations that have accomplished a lot. I was trying to name powerful women in general in the last post"

I also assure you that kids don't make better choices at home. They eat what their parents provide, which is more often than not processed garbage.

14101,2020-09-04 15:12:49,imgckz,I’ve actually joined a couple of months ago 😂 this was a topic that I wanted to discuss. Just tell me her accomplishments!!
14102,2020-09-04 14:13:52,imgckz,"Obama was a savage war time POTUS. Assassinate a guy and then drone strikes the funeral, oof. He was like Oprah but with bombings.  Drone strikes for you! Drone strikes for you! Drone strikes for you! And you! And you!"
14103,2020-09-04 15:51:14,imgckz,"I agree with you. 

It was a weird agenda... but like seriously, she was a black first lady. Why the hell did we usher in Donald Trump and race riots? Because ppl like her failed. Failed hard."
14104,2020-09-04 14:38:09,imgckz,"I appreciate that too. She's got a good heart I think. Sadly when a human gets that much opportunity and fails they have to answer for it. 

Kinda like these billionaires that don't participate in charitable causes.. it's fine, it's their right, but imma judge them hard."
14105,2020-09-04 14:27:16,imgckz,Again instead of telling us what Michelle Obama has done your changing the subject. Your just bringing up something irrelevant.
14106,2020-09-04 14:16:08,imgckz,"I'm not afraid of her at all. I am disappointed in her. As a black first lady, I think she could have accomplished so much more, to include the fact that Ferguson Missouri is still rioting today."
14107,2020-09-04 16:59:03,imgckz,"If the woman, spouse, husband, is highly qualified in a particular field or highly educated in a particular discipline and wants to do something to benefit society shouldn’t they be allowed to? 

If a wife wants to be a stay at home mom/or a husband/spouse that’s fine but if they wanna work outside the home no one would tell them they can’t. Why does that not apply to the first lady or first husband?

Lastly when your spouse is the President of the United States you now have a platform, like it or not, were you are front and center to the whole world. Using that “power“ to stop bullying like the current first lady, encourage kids to eat better and exercise like Michelle, stop using drugs, drinking and driving, embracing green technology, etc. etc. Is, in my humble opinion, a really good thing. 

I feel like we forgot what public service means with this current administration. The president, and the rest of his cabinet, are supposed to be “serving the people” not just who voted for him, not just Republicans, not just his buddies, but everyone. One of my biggest issues with this president, besides his ridiculous hypocrisy,  is his inability to even attempt to unite the country as one. “United we stand“ is there for a reason. You can have all your qualms about Barack Obama or Bush or Clinton but they tried, to the best of their ability, to be presidents to the entire nation. They understood that a large majority didn’t vote for them and they needed to do things to win their confidence, trust, respect etc. This president has no desire whatsoever to do that at all. None whatsoever. Like I’m not the first lady is somewhat of a public servant because of her husband. Using that as a platform to help others is a good thing and should be applauded."
14108,2020-09-04 17:30:14,imgckz,"Right, but that wasn't your question. You didn't ask, 'why don't more people look up to Nancy Pelosi,' it was 'why do they love Michelle Obama.'  That leads me to believe you have an issue with her as a person.

All other people aside, do you find she is unworthy of admiration, and if so, why?"
14109,2020-09-04 17:28:06,imgckz,"> I think efforts would be better served focusing on healthier protein portions as that has more of an effect on their growth, developing and feeling full. This would also help agriculture and local farms.

And I think we could have a good discussion on that. But that's a question of 'how' not 'whether' the program is implemented. If we take childhood obesity and malnutrition seriously, then this was a pretty good way to approach it."
14110,2020-09-04 15:17:03,imgckz,"Can see your profile guy, cut your losses. At this point your coming off lonely."
14111,2020-09-04 16:20:31,imgckz,"His drone strikes have nothing on Trumps, something like 1/6th as frequent."
14112,2020-09-04 14:40:46,imgckz,Yea. That is true the answering for it.   I appreciate the fact she made an honest effort to improve school lunch food. To me it seemed genuine what she was doing and I’ll take an honest fail over just sitting at the pool any day of the week.

14114,2020-09-04 18:36:46,imgckz,"I absolutely agree that obesity and malnutrition are issues and it's good for schools to do what they can to to help. As I originally stated I think the lunch program had good intentions, but misses the mark and needs adjustments. 

Schools can't fix obesity. That is by and large on the shoulders of parents. You can make lunch healthy and delicious and we will still have these issues. I really just wish they could figure out a solution that didn't involve so much wasted food. It's seriously sad to see how much kids don't even touch."

But shit, why we even need such a thing *in the first place* is just a reflection on how imperialist of a country the US is.

The only way they are receptive to communication is if you agree with them.  You’re either with them or against them.

My Qultist posted some insane garbage lie on twitter and if I ever approached him about it, he would tell me i don’t know what I’m talking about..you know, “fake news or msm lies”.   So I created a fake Qtwitter account, followed him and then told him what he posted was proven false.  Of course, he took it down.   I wanted to keep up the ruse and I followed a bunch of Qultists but had to delete the account because I literally couldn’t stomach the stuff coming up in my feed"

An example I encountered was the assertion that FEMA had acquired 30,000 guillotines and would be using them to execute some large number of Americans unspecified. I wanted to know where these were stored as they would take up a huge amount of space I wanted to know where they were acquired. I also made the point that one Guillotine alone could kill thousands of people. Especially if accompanied by readily available automation. I made a wild guess that 30,000 was far more than were needed for any sort of such plan. This back of the napkin reasoning can help to diffuse the immediate anxiety long enough to inquire as to how the person came across the information and why he trusted the source. You can sometimes enable the person to question the validity of that particular outlet in the future. After that you can work on why the person felt a need to hear out such macabre scenarios. This is where things get tricky. Trust is breaking down. But it doesn't mean that FEMA is staffed by hostile people. If you know somebody who works in FEMA you can talk about that. This is a matter of practical cognitive therapy as I understand it. Once the individual knows the truth or can grasp that other outcomes are more likely he can calm himself down to listen to more specific types of reasoning."

A lot of this started when the Equal Time doctrine was removed by Reagan, so hate radio really got it's start after that, and in many areas there was no rebuttal or fact checking for people like Limbaugh, Mark  Levin, and many others.

Social media, Fox news, and proliferation of podcasts & other bigoted and lunatic video has literally re-programmed the Q people's brains to the point where most are unreachable.

I don't think confrontation or presenting  facts to them is worth it, or will work, so you really  can't communicate truth and facts.

OK, you got me there, I'm fairly confident taking Ms. Michelle seriously is much more like not having food on the table for a few weeks out into the future, not because of any opinion, political perspective, or choice, instead of simply deciding whether to have salad or steak for this evening's meal.  I guess I possess more imagination and/or seriousness regarding American politics and socio-economic conditions than Ms. Michelle, even though she is a POC (and above me on the socio-economics scale -- congrats Barack and Michelle and associated children units!

2) Is that actually her house?
3) What type of neighborhood did she grow up on?"
14427,2020-10-09 22:38:56,j85myk,"Going to do rhetoric first:

how much did her house cost? Both adults in that family are very very successful. One is a best selling author and the other is a successful politician. Let x = the total number of families in the USA who could afford their house. Let y =  the number of families where one or more family member is African American who could afford their house. Look at the very big difference between those two numbers.

Take a deep breath. 

Michelle Obama does not need to be perfect to point out some of the very obvious problems her country currently faces.

If she is a hypocrite for speaking out for people who are less rich and successful than her then maybe those people need to afforded more of a voice to rail against the injustice of it themselves....

I can’t hear them doing so, maybe they are fine with it. Maybe don’t currently have much of a voice.

To get to the debunking:

Seems like it’s probably her house.

I’m only going to bother with the last part.
 “Demonises whites people who run away from black neighbourhoods”
Let’s look at this figuratively first.

Cambridge Dictionary 

https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/dictionary.cambridge.org/amp/english/demonize

defines “to demonise” as as follows:

“to try to make someone or a group of people seem as if they are evil”

Quite simply. When has she claimed that white people who run away from black neighbourhoods are evil? Is this even a thing? I’ve literally never heard of a group of white Americans finding themselves in a neighbourhood where plenty of black people live and then deciding to run away. Furthermore if that has ever happened, has anyone called them evil for doing so? If yes, has Michelle Obama?
 
Now we have the figurative interpretation out of the way, let’s look at the literal interpretation.

Has Michelle Obama ever demonstrated the ability to turn people in to demons? 

Now maybe, if you listen to Mike Pence anyway, she might have done that, otherwise you’re clutching at straws and have to accept that the whole post is a load of bs...."

BTW, I believe, and have long advocated, that us little people need to take over the Democratic and Republican parties from below. 3rd parties can be embraced as vehicles for protest votes, which is better than abstaining from voting; but it's hard for me to imagine them becoming winners faster than takeovers could happen.

One of my biggest disappointments with Trump is that he facilitated zero activism towards this end. He apparently believes that HE is a ""movement"". And all those people cheering for him at his endless rallies, accomplished nothing in terms of draining the Republican swamp. IF anything, Trump helped suck oxygen out of the room; and any incipient reformers would have had to compete with him. Trump bragged about all the money he raised for the Republican Party, after having run on ""draining the swamp"". Did he not get the memo that the main route for corrupting the elected government was campaign cash? He's never been a serious, deep reformer, but at least he's not willing to use violence and Deep State treasonous acts to achieve whatever his real goals are.

On the Democratic side, there's been serious movement building, e.g. Justice Democrats."

You hopefully know that the donor class of the Republicans and donor class of the Democrats are mostly the same, don't you?

The corruption in the US government is so bad, it can be shown statistically to be a plutocracy. See [https://represent.us/](https://represent.us) for a quick introduction to research by Gilens and Page."
14440,2020-10-09 16:28:02,j81xe8,"After the success of my Dramatics variation post the other day, I thought I'd share another one: this go round, we're looking at blunt yang. 

I debated finding a ""softer"" FN standing beside a more conventional FN--like [Jennifer Lawrence beside Emma Stone](https://hips.hearstapps.com/ell.h-cdn.co/assets/16/42/1476888790-shutterstock-6392699e-copy.jpg)\--but I decided to go with this one, since I think it's a good illustration of length, the defining characteristic of a FN (with width being secondary). 

At 5'11, Michelle Obama is literally very tall: at her height, even if she looked ""shorter,"" she would still look tall by everyone's metric. She must accommodate her height in a literal way--longer inseams, for example--and with outfits such as this one, she accommodates it visually (an unbroken line). She's also accommodating width with the fabric. This is probably my favorite of her outfits, and she has a lot of great ones! 

What I love about this picture is that SJP looks so tiny standing beside Michelle... but if you cover Michelle up with your hand, SJP in isolation actually looks a bit taller than her actual height of 5'2.5. I think this has to do with having proportionally long, narrow arms and legs--we'll say ""answer A""--along with ""answer B"" shoulders. While I don't think she looks *tall*\--I would give her an ""answer C"" on the test for vertical--I think her shoulders, arms and legs, and all over bluntness come together to give us a Flamboyant Natural. 

Michelle and SJP are also both ""curvy FNs"" in that they have very noticeable w/h ratios (in test terms, I think they'd both answer D/E for waists and hips). I think both of these outfits illustrate how, unlike, say, a Romantic, they don't have to emphasize their curves to look put together; they have strong enough bone structures for clothes to hang on their own. TBH, I feel like FNs are kind of the ""clothes horses"" of the IDs for this very reason! 

Side note: They also show how, tbh, I think faces *do* matter in Kibbe. It's a hot take, but based **solely** on bodies, I think Michelle could theoretically be a SD and SJP could conceivably be a SN.  But their essences/vibes, and the blunt yang in their faces, are pure free spirt FN!"
14441,2020-10-10 09:03:51,j81xe8,LOVE how flamboyant Michelle was with this outfit. Those boots! 😍
14442,2020-10-10 11:27:44,j81xe8,"SJP looks so tiny compared to Michelle Obama, this is why DK should've kept the pure N category"

14447,2020-10-10 16:48:55,j81xe8,"This post convinced me even more that these two are never ever the same type and  SJP is again typed by DK not knowing her in real life. If at all she is pure natural and not FN. Probably a simple super trained DC. Yes she seems a bit longer as she is but FN recommendations have extra focus on long vertical and width and SJP cannot have real life elongation and the bit width she has probably due to the intense training she definitly does.

[https://ro.pinterest.com/pin/445434219395734166/](https://ro.pinterest.com/pin/445434219395734166/)

So many here fuss about one inch in the height recommendations even when lots of 5'7 naturals with longer torso and shorter legs in proportion lacking visual vertical and yin flesh are so much better of in SN recommendations as in FN.  DK himself insts so much abut strict height. Yet with SJP a total out of touch exception and majority tries vehement to agree because SJP is ""verified""."

14451,2020-10-11 12:19:30,j81xe8,"There isn’t actually a lower height limit! A 5’4” dramatic probably wouldn’t have literal length to accommodate (buying tall jeans, needing to get longer dresses, etc) but she may need to visually accommodate length because of proportions that make her body look very elongated. Now, I’m not saying SJP is FN but you are heavily implying that there is a lower height limit and people under 5’7” cannot be tall types. 

This is not true. Most of the fashion recs have nothing to do with whether or not you would look short next to someone of the same type who is 6 inches taller than you- a dramatic who is 5’2” and looks 5’10 within their own proportions is still going to seem like a short person next to a dramatic who’s actually 5’10”, but they would still have that visual length to accommodate, so I don’t see your point that “SJP cannot have real life elongation.” 

Again, I am not saying SJP is FN (I agree with your DC assessment for the most part) but according to Kibbe’s system she could 100% have strong elongation that would need to be visually accommodated."

Also, I was at that board meeting. The naming of the school was a small fraction of the work they did in that session. If anyone is curious, the other choice was John Lewis, but Michelle Obama won out by 2 votes.  Personally, I think John Lewis would have been the better option."

14482,2020-10-09 06:44:06,j7qy7y,"I agree with you.  When it comes to ISSUES, POLICIES, one's skin color and background don't matter much.

Trump is an irrelevant twit. What he says matters not a whit to anyone except idiotic ""news"" reporters or anchors or late-nite comics who talk about how awful he is, how awful the things he says to get a reaction. Stories about Trump are click bait.

COVID patients could, right now, be covered at 100% of costs with Medicare, but Congress is too busy trying to load the spending bills with pork for their rich donors.

I want everyone to have Scandinavian-style medical insurance and coverage at 100% coverage, NO corporations involved at any level, the best and most comprehensive of those I've read up on; they also pay for it with a payroll deduction like we pay for Medicare, but they cover *everything*, including paid parental leave for both parents for +/-one year after a child is born at 80% of their salary (time to be divided between the parents, and for practicality the mother takes the first few months, and the father the last couple of months); when a parent returns to work, job guaranteed, they have trained staff at child care centers. BTW, they also have paid sick leave for their people, and it's possible for the employee to have paid sick leave to take care of a child, spouse, parent.

Bernie designed the most elementary introduction of their model for his S. 1129 Medicare for All, not nearly the extent of their coverage, but it could be a start. If passed, S. 1129 would positively affect everyone of every demographic to have a NON-corporate government-administered single-payer health insurance, NO co-pays, NO deductibles, everything covered (except OCDs like aspirin, acetaminophen and the like), including dental, optical, audio services, and full coverage of pre-existing conditions; it should also include physical therapy facilities (currently some are in-facility places, and attached to nursing homes, but temporary for people who need PT after knee or hip replacement therapy and the like), convalescent care for bedridden patients, or hospice care for those with terminal conditions.

We need to tweak our current Medicare to include dental, optical, audio coverage (which would be included in S. 1129 if they're not added before a full Medicare for All coverage is passed).  We already pay for Medicare with a payroll deduction but can't use it unless we're declared disabled or until we retire. It really wouldn't be such a huge issue to extend that to cover everyone of every age, pre-natal through death. The payroll deduction would likely go up, but other things like Medicaid (which pays for at least part of nursing home or physical therapy care as a supplement to Medicare now - both of these things currently have hefty co-pays) could be budgeted accordingly. Congress could cut the defense budget in half and go all out using that money for Medicare for All, tuition, a Green New Deal, jobs programs installing wind turbines, building infrastructure that needs replacing or new projects, or repairing those things that can be repaired. With that much money NOT being spent on unconstitutional and illegal wars, the possibilities are endless.

Tuition-free college or trade school would benefit all who want higher education, as well as a student's future when they aren't burdened with twenty years of repaying school loans. People could buy houses, afford to get married, have a child or two (if they want - some people prefer a child-free existence).

The point being, many of these policies that *could* be enacted (if Congress would stop being selfish about getting their ""campaign contributions"" - bribes - from wealthy donors and rich people) would benefit multiple demographic cross-sections of our population."

14491,2020-10-09 00:39:23,j7n9zw,C'mon man!
14492,2020-10-09 02:26:21,j7n9zw,I didn't see the Satire tag and actually thought this was real
14493,2020-10-08 23:38:36,j7n9zw,It's super sad when  you can't tell fact from fiction anymore...
14494,2020-10-09 00:01:03,j7n9zw,This is gold.
14495,2020-10-09 11:51:16,j7n9zw,"Kamala is very unlikable. Michael is unlikeable as well though. Hillary was also unlikable. Pelosi is unlikeable. They are all smug stuck up assholes. Why do they always choose these type of woman? Tulsi was authentically nice. Should have picked her. I'm really not looking forward to Kamala as President. If that happens the best thing to come out of it, will be the 2nd coming of the TEA party and the sweeping elections of 2022. Don't know how much damage she will do before then, we are probably fucked."
14496,2020-10-09 02:52:03,j7n9zw,"Isn't it amazing, potentially most powerful person on the planet and is a fucking joke."
14497,2020-10-08 23:39:56,j7n9zw,It literally says “satire” on the tag
14498,2020-10-09 13:59:43,j7n9zw,"Funny thing is, this line 

>Politifact rated Joe's statement as ""mostly true,"" since Michelle Obama had in fact released a video response to the presidential debates a couple of days ago and that was ""basically the same thing as debating.""

could likely be true."
14499,2020-10-09 12:19:11,j7n9zw,"It’s funny you say that because I was just thinking about this before. I understand the frustration people have with the “likability” tag being associated with women. It is sexist. But unfortunately it does exist. You can acknowledge it all you want and fight against it. But if this election is so important for liberals, and it’s already an uphill battle, why would you choose Kamala? She comes across terribly: condescending, fake, occasionally hysterical. 

It’s like they tried to fight the likability test by finding the most unlikable person around. I don’t see how this won’t bite them in the ass."
14500,2020-10-09 04:59:51,j7n9zw,That implies he has a chance at getting elected lol
14501,2020-10-08 23:50:46,j7n9zw,"No,  what I mean is that it would 100% not surprise me to read that title on an actual article.  I know it's a satire article."
14502,2020-10-09 05:03:36,j7n9zw,That would require people reading
14503,2020-10-09 13:57:59,j7n9zw,"Is it really sexist though, considering that a very large number of people who are opposed to Trump say it is because of how he talks or behaves?  Aren't they basing their opinions on his likability as well?"
14504,2020-10-09 05:00:49,j7n9zw,"He is a candidate, by his own merit ~~or through Pelosi and DNC kicking everybody else out of the way~~"
14505,2020-10-09 00:59:31,j7n9zw,Pies Law has been put to the test in recent years.
14506,2020-10-09 14:25:35,j7n9zw,"I do believe there is some unconscious sexism in the way we expect female candidates to behave, but it’s not as extreme as they make it out to be. I think if you put too much stock in it, then you pick someone stupid like Harris because you expect that people won’t like her anyway and overlook that she’s very alienating. Warren, Tulsi, and Klochbacher came across much better than she does."
14507,2020-10-09 05:01:28,j7n9zw,"Yeah he's a candidate, but come on, come one"

14518,2020-11-09 15:00:41,jqywow,Social media is one of the biggest contributors to the issues you touch on. I hope in the next ten years we start to see more studies about how mentally unhealthy social media is and we see people voluntarily abstaining from social media and a sort of stigma develops around people who continue to be addicted to it. Sort of like what has happened with the social attitude toward cigarettes over the past 30 years.
14519,2020-11-09 12:36:25,jqwt1r,Good luck! We're all gonna need it...
14520,2020-11-09 13:24:28,jqwt1r,"If it adds any context, your pop has adopted Alex Jones’ worldview pretty aggressively; this post was almost a timeline of the Alex Jones Show for the least 5 years."

Hey now, I worked very hard on my crater. In fact, we all worked very hard on it, do you have any idea how difficult it is to assemble on-site with nothing to guide you but an unexplained gravity well?

But in a serious note, he's probably not gonna suddenly get better even if he comes to the conclusion that they are all pissing in the same pot."
14522,2020-11-09 22:03:37,jqwt1r,"Lol at “who built the moon”.

My husband is Q crazy and would probably be best friends with you dad, so I sympathize.  Glad you found us.  I hope you’re able to keep yourself sane.  Keep us update if you have any good news.

14523,2020-11-09 13:04:40,jqwt1r,So sorry to read this. You're definitely not alone. I've found it weirdly comforting just reading others stories and have had some great advice and been so touched by people's kindness on here.  Take care of yourself ❤️
14524,2020-11-09 12:39:58,jqwt1r,Thanks. I'm thinking about showing him this group as a way of highlighting how much of a problem this is.

14527,2020-11-09 20:54:31,jqwt1r,"There was someone else who posted here earlier who had found this group and it helped wake them up out of the Q hole. I think it's worth a try. Worst thing that happens is he dismisses it, but it might make him think a bit to see how destructive this is to so many people and the impacts it's really having on families and loved ones, and thereby really understand what it's doing to you."
14528,2020-11-09 05:30:44,jqr4ip,Wait... Luann who I assumed voted for Donald in 2016 due to pleading the fifth on who she voted for on the reunion actually donated six times the amount of Carole's contribution??? That makes me appreciate her *Feeling Joe B!den* post more.
14529,2020-11-09 04:48:21,jqr4ip,"Most aren't surprising, but seeing the actual information is still very fascinating!"

14531,2020-11-09 04:50:11,jqr4ip,Wow I’m surprised by Erika! I didn’t know she was interested in politics

14533,2020-11-09 04:59:31,jqr4ip,"Wow, Bethenny, wow! ❤️"
14534,2020-11-09 05:03:38,jqr4ip,"The most surprising to me is how low most of the donations are. I would have guessed most Housewives would be donating Frankel and Girardi amounts, based on all the bragging they do about wealthy. Must be smoke and mirrors, because the couple hundred or couple thousand here and there sounds like what upper middle class is donating to their party/candidates."
14535,2020-11-09 04:44:05,jqr4ip,Seems like Camille is the morally corrupt one....
14536,2020-11-09 05:09:53,jqr4ip,Shocked at how little Carole donated to Hilary after she was so obsessed with her and probably spent more on the party she threw for her.
14537,2020-11-09 08:54:05,jqr4ip,It’s much less republican than I thought.
14538,2020-11-09 05:17:45,jqr4ip,"Wtf Camille, Rudy Giuliani??"
14539,2020-11-09 04:56:00,jqr4ip,"Good on Carole for donating to Jaime Harrison, he was an incredible candidate and I hope he gets his due!

I can’t imagine a time when Graham wasn’t the slime ball he is, Erika donated a huge chunk of change too but aside from that seems blue through and through, wonder why he was the exception."
14540,2020-11-09 04:52:57,jqr4ip,"I’m just shocked that most of the ones who actually have money have donated so little. I’ve donated more than most of them, and I only make $50,000 a year."
14541,2020-11-09 05:32:10,jqr4ip,I am impressed and unimpressed with these donations - holding both those truths. Thanks for channeling your inner MKE 🧐
14542,2020-11-09 05:23:20,jqr4ip,Kelsey Grammer’s a huge republican so I’m not surprised.
14543,2020-11-09 06:55:28,jqr4ip,"erika's donations to further left types at first made no sense, then i remembered her husband is the erin brockovich small town vs. criminal/corrupt big chem lawyer guy and it fits better lol

they must have donated as a couple or something"
14544,2020-11-09 04:47:58,jqr4ip,I'd like to see who the Jersey girls donated to.
14545,2020-11-09 06:13:04,jqr4ip, I might just have to stan Erika and Eileen for giving to Ed Markey and Marianne Williamson.
14546,2020-11-09 05:36:29,jqr4ip,"1. You are doing the lord's work 
2. Camille. Wow, she's [pernicious.](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/05/aa/8e/05aa8ed945c22debca5781e6bc557937.gif)"
14547,2020-11-09 04:51:58,jqr4ip,"I honestly didn't know I needed this information, thank you!"
14548,2020-11-09 04:54:24,jqr4ip,In regards to Erica I wonder if the donations were really from Tom and he just the hit the personal limit? She doesn't seem aware enough to know politics. She's so self-absorbed that I just can't see it.
14549,2020-11-09 06:40:19,jqr4ip,[Take a peek](https://www.chelefarley.com/issues) at the woman Ramona donated to\*

14551,2020-11-09 10:53:50,jqr4ip,"I read in a locked thread that Brandi from Dallas is a T donor? I tried to look into it a bit but I could only find a 2016 tweet from her bragging about dining with him. 

Does anyone have any more info about this?"
14552,2020-11-09 04:48:04,jqr4ip,"Big yikes to Erika Jayne and the donation to Lindsey Graham. I trust your assessment OP, but it’s hard to separate him from his current hateful ideology.

I’m also surprised about Yolanda. I would have pegged her as a diehard GOP supporter given her racist comments."
14553,2020-11-09 04:49:27,jqr4ip,Yikes Camille Grammer
14554,2020-11-09 07:19:55,jqr4ip,Ugh I love Andrew Yang so much. 1 point for you Leah.
14555,2020-11-09 06:12:11,jqr4ip,"God Camille just wtf?

If she could she would have sent $ to Kavanaugh."

14557,2020-11-09 06:11:25,jqr4ip,I LOVE THIS THANK YOU
14558,2020-11-09 06:07:07,jqr4ip,Isn’t the tea on Lu in 2016 was that she was too embarrassed to say she didn’t vote at all? Or am I mixing that up somewhere? I swear I read something along the lines of that...
14559,2020-11-09 09:44:44,jqr4ip,"I really dislike this trend of forcing everyone to reveal who they voted for. There's a reason you vote in private. If you want to say who you voted for you're free to, but we shouldn't chastise or shame people for not wanting to discuss it openly."

well, well, well how the turntables..."
14561,2020-11-09 06:21:54,jqr4ip,Good point. Plus voting is intended to be private and personal for a reason. You don't have to share your views with anyone. And I feel like she was just sticking up for that right. I dig it.
14562,2020-11-09 07:53:07,jqr4ip,That’s what struck me too! Ramona donating $500 dollars?! What a cheapskate lmao
14563,2020-11-09 05:23:22,jqr4ip,All I could think about reading her donations was that time she tried to defend Kavanaugh (sp?) regarding the rape allegations. It’s odd to be able to identify with an accused rapist so easily.
14564,2020-11-09 05:43:16,jqr4ip,I think she donated a lot of time.
14565,2020-11-09 07:31:13,jqr4ip,She defended Kavanaigh on tv. This is the least surprising
14566,2020-11-09 09:12:25,jqr4ip,As a Brit I’m shocked he ran? Wtf that goblin is a terrifying candidate
14567,2020-11-09 05:07:18,jqr4ip,"Back in 2007, Graham was considered a moderate -- he worked on bipartisan immigration reform, for example, and he also voted to confirm a lot of Obama's judges. (For the record, I don't think he was ever a moderate, but that's just what the media perception was)"
14568,2020-11-09 05:04:38,jqr4ip,"I totally agree! So weird to see any donations under $500 given their wealth. In this list, I only included a couple of the total donations they made! In particular, Erika made A LOT more donations than I listed."
14569,2020-11-09 04:51:35,jqr4ip,I’d like to know if the Jersey girls open their purses at all
14570,2020-11-09 06:49:44,jqr4ip,I just quickly looked up the OGs and nothing showed up under any of their names
14571,2020-11-09 05:22:25,jqr4ip,"Oh yeah, that's totally the case for some of these donations. In fact, some of them were flagged as ""reattribution from Thomas Girardi,"" meaning it was a joint contribution. Also, the breadth and scale of her donations (congressional races across this country, throughout multiple election cycles) definitely suggests someone else was helping her decide where to donate."
14572,2020-11-09 08:10:16,jqr4ip,"I’m not sure actually, I think Erika is a smart cookie. Just because she (weirdly) only gives us one dimensional, I don’t think she actually is."
14573,2020-11-09 09:48:00,jqr4ip,"Funny how she's all about the ""gays"" yet she's donated to GOP candidates..."
14574,2020-11-09 07:47:28,jqr4ip,"Wow Ramona, wow."
14575,2020-11-09 05:02:02,jqr4ip,Oh yeah definitely not trying to defend her donation -- Just trying to contextualize why she might have done so back in 2007! I think he was the only Republican she ever donated to (She's given thousands and thousands to a lot of Democrats -- more so than any other housewife on the list)
14576,2020-11-09 04:53:32,jqr4ip,She's supporting an LBGTQ candidate. 🤣
14577,2020-11-09 05:23:48,jqr4ip,Same. So on brand.
14578,2020-11-09 06:38:12,jqr4ip,doubtful
14579,2020-11-09 05:34:09,jqr4ip,"Erika’s donations are likely just ways for Tom to give more to his preferred candidates w/o going over limits.  Maybe I’m underestimating her, but she doesn’t seem politically savvy enough to be interested in all those races."
14580,2020-11-09 06:58:46,jqr4ip,"i had the same perception (would love to be wrong) especially since, apart from the *shudders* lindsay graham contribution, her chosen candidates seem much more to the left (esp fiscally) than she comes off. with tom g., it fits a bit better."

14596,2020-11-09 02:25:23,jqmo1e,Not surprising that she spews this hatred towards right-wingers/conservatives. Absolutely disgusting human being.
14597,2020-11-09 22:27:02,jqmo1e,And maybe just maybe presidents shouldn’t tweet....
14598,2020-11-09 04:23:08,jqmo1e,"That's true our president had never done that before. A pinnacle of a perfect human being. /s
Now I'm not left wing, and tend to be more conservative, but I'm certain the top man in our government had also said some hate monger things."
14599,2020-11-11 14:57:05,jqmo1e,"This. I understand that, for better or worse, a large part of our country gets information from Twitter, so I won’t discount the platform entirely. That said, if a president MUST tweet, they shouldn’t do it from a personal account, and it sure as heck should be presidential in tone and content."
14600,2020-11-09 04:38:51,jqmo1e,No doubt but at least for me Michelle is on a different level. Ugh that woman.

But the media will give her a pass for saying this because she’s a Democrat, while they deliberately chop up what Trump says to make him look worse and report things out of context."

14607,2020-11-08 20:00:44,jqhkv2,I'm not sure Michelle wants to go into politics. She'd be great though. I'd like to see a Bernie/AOC presidential team!
14608,2020-11-08 21:51:07,jqhkv2,"Trying very hard not to be to harsh but: I think dynasties are a blight unto politics. if it were up to me members of the same family should not be allowed to campaign for the office one of their family members already held. I don't believe in nobility, so talks of ""the Kennedies"", ""the Clintons"", ""the Obamas"", ""the Bushes"" or ""the McCains"" (and now probably ""the Trumps"" too) always leave a bitter taste in my mouth. There are plenty of women out there who would do as good a job, if not better, who's main credentials aren't: ""related to someone who already held this office"".

To get to your question though:

Realistically i would like Nina Turner/Rashida Tlaib. I say realistically here because they would both be eligible without the need for a supreme court battle

Ideally I would Like Ilhan Omar at the top of the ticket. Could you imagine the collective foaming at the mouth the right will instantly do if a female Muslim immigrant would become the president? The thought brings a smile to my face every time i think about it."

Y'all sleeping on Ayanna Pressley. She and AOC can be president/VP in whichever combo they like."
14611,2020-11-08 19:25:40,jqhkv2,"Oh man. I have day dreamed about Michelle as president so many times. What a refined, thoughtful, and damn smart woman. I respect her views on politics but I think those who are the most worthy to lead are those who don't want the mantle."

They say trump divided the nation with hate or w/e yet people now are burning stuff with trump on it like its in irak.

Biden presented himself as a moderate in order to steal some votes off Trump, yet the majority of his party are so leftist that it's close to lunacy. I wish him luck handling both. He has a choice between either sticking to moderate campaign promises and losing the backing of his party, or to listen to what his party leaders tell him and throwng all campaign promises out of the window. 

We all know which option it's going to be, though."

Ok, a bit of northern african history : Arouch is a typical name in Kabyle/Berber communities, way less so than in arabic communities (maybe one of my N-A brothers can enlighten us more), and so it obviously found its way into how family names were made by the French/brits/Italians during the colonisation of Africa. If someone had the family name of Arouch, he probably was something similar to a democratically elected representative).  


It one hundred percent is not in any way possible for this person to be Kamala Harris because literally it obviously makes no sense, i'm just surprised Qannoners went to the lengths of using a berber name on a Libyan man (their berber community is like 1% of the population and heavily stigmatized by like every Libyan government) going to...Britain? in order to become a Carribean/Indian woman? ...And then.

14782,2020-12-15 08:28:20,kdgx0t,"Hey Sleepy, 

Sorry to hear everything that’s going on, I’m sure it’s hard enough transitioning without adding in the stresses of unaccepting family.

 I feel like your family will either learn to be accept you or they won’t therefore I feel like it’s best if you transition on your own time without delaying to suit someone else’s feelings on the matter. 

This is your journey, either your parents hop on the ride or they hop off. Obviously I’m going to highlight I want to make sure you have access to safety or your own house/family/friends. Maybe introduce yourself the way you want to present yourself in increments. 

Whilst QAnon is a new phenomenon and influences and stories on LGBT+ might be less common, it is super common in religious environments, I’d advise finding content of others who deal with the stigma from family members regarding their sexual orientation/gender. 

Ultimately this is your life but I want you to live your best life and present the best version of yourself but I fully understand the complexities of family dynamics and the fear of losing family connections, especially if you aren’t ready for it. 

Right now is contentious times in QAnon and trumpism, hopefully some come to their senses over the next couple of months. 

If you need to vent feel free to DM. Keep using this group tho, hopefully you find some strategies, be happy, be safe and be proud of your identity. 🏳️‍🌈

14783,2020-12-15 10:49:22,kdgx0t,"I’m so sorry that you have to deal with this. I think you must be true to yourself, otherwise you can’t be happy. You should never reinforce bigotry of any kind. Easy for me to say, when it’s your dad I know.

Unfortunately, I feel it is people who have prejudices or people who are unwilling to work on their prejudices or even realise that we all have them who are the most likely to be severely influenced by this Q narrative. 

To them, kindness becomes a dirty word, therefore caring for others, equality, fairness and decent behaviour is now synonymous with ‘evil’. The concept of ‘good’ is literally twisted onto its head. You cannot, anymore be good otherwise you’re ‘evil’. It’s a mind fuck for those of us unfortunate enough to be the observers of this in those close to us. It also makes us confront the uncomfortable truth that these people always had those tendencies. 

You know that you are not the one seeing things twisted, here. So I would urge you to have courage and rise above your dad’s behaviour. Nothing about Q is rational."
14784,2020-12-15 13:16:25,kdgx0t,"Hey, I’m in a similar situation, living with actively transphobic family. They’re hardcore terfs rather than qcumbers but same shit honestly. I wish I had some advice for you besides “just get out”, which I know isn’t an option for a lot of people. All I can say is try and find a friend or family member you can potentially stay with on short notice and keep a bag with meds, essentials, etc to hand in case all hell breaks loose and you need to run out. I’ve done that recently (even though I’m not planning on using it) and knowing it’s there has helped with the stress of it a little."
14785,2020-12-15 13:33:42,kdgx0t,"If you’re dependent financially, consider holding off on the social transition until you’re out of the house.

But once you’re out of the house, don’t hold back due to a possible loss of relationship with your father.

He’s a Neanderthal living in 2020. He can choose to evolve or not. Don’t let his backwardness dissuade from you living your true self."
14786,2020-12-15 11:03:44,kdgx0t,"Hi, I don’t have any advice for you. I just wanted to give you a huge virtual hug and to say, you aren’t alone even when you feel you are. So much love to you ♥️♥️♥️💕"
14787,2020-12-15 14:25:48,kdgx0t,"I’m sorry you’ve had to go through this, it sounds like an incredibly stressful environment. It does sound like they’ve at least given you the freedom to go about your transition (at least some parts of your transition) even if they might not be fully supportive of it (which I can understand must be hard when it probably is not an easy thing to go through normally). Are you sure that freedom won’t be extended to the other stages of your transition?

Have you looked into any LGBT charities/orgs or brought this up with your doctor? As while the Q side of the equation is probably too new, but the unsupportive family element I can only imagine is all too common that there might be some advice or assistance they can give in that area?

I’m not sure if it’s helpful but I’ve seen quite a few kids post here about transitioning with Q parents. So you’re definitely not alone in that struggle. 

> But I'm terrified to finally socially transition (change name, pronouns, presentation, etc.), partly due to my parents who I still live with. 

What is the fear here? Are you afraid he will ignore them, or are you afraid he’ll force you to stop, or is there a fear of being kicked out or disowned or even violence?

Also why do you think this is where the line would be drawn? If he has already been around during other stages of your transition. 

> He's tried to tell me that gender dysphoria isn't a real thing, and scoffs at ""doctors"" in general when I cite the medical consensus that says otherwise. He has legitimately suggested I get shock conversion therapy instead of HRT, saying it ""fixed"" his father who received shock conversion therapy as a child. He hasn't raised the issue any further since I started HRT almost a year ago, but I can tell he's still silently unhappy about it. 

Maybe he has started to accept it/is coming to terms with it? It sounds like he still loves you though, this just might be something that takes him some time to finally come around to. 

Also there could be a number of reasons why it is difficult for him to come to terms with, it doesn’t necessarily mean he doesn’t care about you. For instance, maybe he had built up in his head what life might be like in the future but now he has to accept that those expectations might not longer be a reality, or maybe there’s a religious aspect/concern, or it could even be a fear for your well-being/safety. Have you ever spoken to him about where he might be coming from? If you can openly discuss this kind of thing with him (is safe to do so), it might help to find out what the underlying issue is, as then you can better understand how to address it and hopefully help him better come to terms with it. 

> My relationship with him is already extremely strained due to his faith in Qanon and every online personality who engages with them. We've ended up in arguments several times when my frustration with hearing Q propaganda blaring on the tv in the next room every evening boils over. It makes every interaction with him so tense. And it's even worse knowing that he almost certainly dislikes trans people, people like me.

On the Q side of things it tends to be better to try not to engage, as there’s rarely ever any good that comes out from it if you’re not in agreement with whatever they believe. Since always actively engaging and fighting over it can get pretty draining fairly quickly. 

But beyond the Q stuff, how is your relationship with him like in other areas? Or if Q just dominates every part of the relationship, have you tried pushing the discussion into other areas/non-Q topics? 

> I almost want to delay socially transitioning to avoid completely ruining my what remains of my relationship with him. He's still my father and I love him but I'm just so afraid he'll think less of me when I do, and I'm even more terrified of what he'll say to me and about me. I know it's not healthy to repress and delay this over him and I likely won't, but it's just been so difficult seeing his obsession with Q shift him and his beliefs so much, to the point where he might not even consider me his child anymore in a few months.

Just do whatever is best for your own safety and mental well-being. Also please be mindful/aware of your own mental state and how that’s progressing, as depression is far too common and can easily/quickly spiral downward. 

> Sorry if this was ranty and messy. I had just discovered this sub tonight and teared up reading the posts, it all hit so close to home. Needed to vent my own experiences after finally finding a community who understands. Thank you for reading.

If it helps then that’s what this place is for."
14788,2020-12-15 14:27:44,kdgx0t,"First of all, safety comes first.  You know him and his capabilities, and he may not be the type to hurt a fly.  Just be sure you're evaluating your safety with the person who's standing there now, not the guy you thought he was.

The other thing is, his falling into a cult has nothing to do with you.  If he rejects you now, he was probably never really going to be in your corner anyway, and there isn't really anything you can do about it, it's all on him.  You are you, and he can decide to accept you or not.  You can change some things like your opinions or habits, but you can't change who you fundamentally are, and you shouldn't have to anyway."

You don't get stuck with family, you choose it! If they arent being rational, and attacking your identity because of their preconceived notions, you aren't obligated to care about them.

14794,2020-12-14 23:17:06,kd40kd,"About your last point: I've considered that too and I'm starting to think that moment was almost entirely about Gary. I know she's abusive and demeaning to him throughout their entire 18 year long relationship, but I think she really really loved him. She was willing to go on this vicious, brutal journey to get to the presidency again because she knew she had this person, almost like another appendage of hers, to carry her there. They were best friends and life partners. I have no doubt that if she hadn't blamed him they would have spend the rest of their lives together. So I think she just really felt the loss in that moment, and the imagery of her alone in the Oval Office was supposed to echo back to her/the audience that she'd thrown away the one person she really cared about for something that wasn't even worth it without him. 

I think she just fucking hates herself in that moment. About the loss of her original team only in that they represented trust and companionship, dynamics she probably has with NO one during her presidency, maybe never again."

I could tell you’re not American Because you (rightly) were confused about all the weird political machinations that a) are weird and nonsensical in real life and b) are not dealt with by the characters in the show in a logical way. Lots of opportunities are wasted, priorities are re-arranged constantly, and Selena and her team are generally just reactive and chaotic."
14796,2020-12-15 16:45:25,kd40kd,"I love your write-up. You brought up several things that I never thought about. For example, I thought Sue was an important character up until she disappeared from the show. I guess I will need to rewatch it again!"
14797,2020-12-24 08:49:58,kd40kd,"great points all but just wanted to point out - if a president wanted to kibosh same sex marriage they could.   

There's a reason people are really upset about the conservative panel of supreme court justices.    
if for whatever reason same sex marriage becomes a political bargaining chip it could be gotten rid of really easily now.   
Look at the way Trump kneecapped immigration and immigration reform in 1 term, if he had gotten another term he would've gotten his border wall too"

14819,2020-12-14 13:13:21,kcx545,I’m honestly amazed how many people on this show raise kids and make it to middle age without learning any life lessons or maturing.

I love you so mach, I want to kiss you so mach etc. It's wild, she's even off putting his face over everything she owns. Why? So you can explain to every person you're dating a man near the same age as your children?

She makes no sense. I respect her grinding for money and bettering herself, but that game console scene was fucking weird. I think Zied will blow up if she pisses him off and she'll instantly have flashbacks to her ex who fucked her mentally, financially etc."
14821,2020-12-14 13:51:39,kcx545,"Is it six months before he’s legally allowed to work? I suppose she doesn’t want him cruising Facebook while she’s slaving away at the chicken restaurant and that’s why she got him a console. I still have to watch this episode but I really think he should be very grateful that she’s doing all this for him, and he should be doing all the cooking, cleaning & laundry while she’s at work. It’s essential he does an English course too and I seem to remember he did a HVAC course in Tunisia, now it’s time to refresh and update his skills for the American market. 

I seem to remember from their original season someone on here finding out that she was only some kind of trainee P.I. for a very limited time, and that she only had a licence for a year or thereabouts, so that was Sharp trying to glam her up for the show; she’s worked at that restaurant for a long time."
14822,2020-12-14 14:04:10,kcx545,"I don't buy the ""I didn't have time to find an apt for Myself and Zied and we are moving in with my daughter""

This is a strategic storyline. It gets her daughter and boyfriend TV time and a small paycheck.  Plus it provides a storyline of Zied interacting with Rebecca's kids."

14825,2020-12-14 16:22:35,kcx545,"Rebecca drives me insane. She cannot live with a man's attention. She has never had a successful relationship outside of her children so that is what she looks for in a man...someone she can be a mother to. She was mother hen last night, so worried about him being stressed at his interview. She needs to take a permanent sabbatical from being in a relationship and fix herself!"
14826,2020-12-14 14:05:54,kcx545,"There is a reason why her life is the way it is and it’s because she makes illogical decisions. 
There are so many things he could be doing instead of playing video games WHILE SHE WORKS all day. 
She is turned on by his immaturity. 
I would love to know the IQ of the cast members. I do not think it would be Mach in her case"
14827,2020-12-14 15:37:58,kcx545,"The $200 she spent on the console could have been spent on an English course or some sort of course that will help him get a job, in Tunisia I know it’s really hard to get a job if you’re not well connected or your father isn’t, but you can’t finally go the states and the first thought that comes to mind is play video games, he will have a lot of exploring to do and integrating in the community"

But relationship- wise, I don't find them cute at all. Zied isn't a great catch to start with: he gets angry over petty shit, has all these weird ""in my culture"" expectations (that he said he won't bring to America), has apparently little education, doesn't speak English well enough to maintain a relationship or a job. He doesn't even drive! Really all he brings to the table is being young, just like Becky likes them.

And she is so cringe. Buying a console for her man child, always bragging how young he is. I find her really aggressive about this, just like she still is with her ridiculously shopped selfies. Like everybody has to acknowledge her being such a sassy youthful mama whose milkshake brings all the boys to her yard.

I also think she lies habitually. She was never a real PI. And I think she's 52, that's what the leaked Experian files have her at."
14830,2020-12-14 14:46:27,kcx545,Rebecca is the delusional middle-aged woman who would hit on her daughter’s boyfriend behind her back

14833,2020-12-14 15:27:45,kcx545,"Same, I was like mumbling ""he could read a book... or learn some English"" to the screen when she said she needed a game system for him. In some ways I suspect she wants to keep him on the ignorant side of speaking English or being ready for American society in general. Maybe it is control? Because she kinda kicked off on her SM of women DMing Zied.

Rebecca looks more and more delusional with every bit of new information and looks like hanging in some kind of teenage fantasy of her-boy-covered pillows; I cannot believe they haven't even talked about his favourite game or such in that long, long period of 'communication. I feel sorry for her kids that they are not the priority they deserve to be."
14834,2020-12-14 16:19:39,kcx545,If you have ONE eviction on your record it’s next to impossible to rent an apartment in your own name. I think she has several
14835,2020-12-14 14:29:29,kcx545,The first thing I said when she said “so he isn’t bored” was “clean the house then.” What a useless manchild but she enables it.
14836,2020-12-14 15:12:01,kcx545,She's 49 😙. And I came here with the same concerns after watching her broke ass waste $$$ on a Playstation or whatever.
14837,2020-12-14 15:22:11,kcx545,"It was the picture blanket for me. 🙄 I can’t with Rebecca, for a lot of the exact reasons you mentioned. She’s just embarrassing. I would go crazy if I had Rebecca for a parent."
14838,2020-12-14 16:02:46,kcx545,"Maybe Rebecca has another motive for sharing an apartment with her daughter and the boyfriend.  Depending on their work schedules, someone is likely to be home at random times with Zied.  Along with the game console, she's hoping that will keep Zied occupied enough that he won't wander off and explore the sights, and possibly other women, in Woodstock, GA."
14839,2020-12-14 16:15:39,kcx545,"I can't stand either of them. 

Her and her daughter were planning to move in together for some time from what I remember from the show. Not sure why they aren't saying this on this season. I remember watching something before with her and her daughter looking at places together. Zied seemed to have an issue with it then also. Than again with TLC who know what is filmed when. They seem to like to move things around. 

I do think the ""religion/culture"" thing as being the reason he doesn't want to live there is crap too. If that was the reason then he also wouldn't be willing to sleep in the same room with her. I think it is more the fact that Zied doesn't want other males around at all. As well as the daughters b/f is around his same age and She clearly likes men of that age. if she is smart she would find something small for the two of them as Zied and her daughter's b/f are likely to get in a fight. Even if it is just a studio apartment at least then she might be able to save a little money while having to pay for everything. 

As for the gaming system. I don't think he demanded it. She never said he asked for it. She said she wanted to get him something to do. So I won't blame that one on him. Though I could see him doing something like that. I find it ridiculous that she is spending that much on a gaming system for him when money is clearly an issue. There are a lot cheaper systems she could have went with. Not to mention like many of said there are other things he could be doing with his time. Such as figuring out what kind of job he will want when he can work. Then taking any classes that he might need for said job. 

The fact that she doesn't see the red flags in the relationship already tells me this is going to be just like he last marriage. Can't believe some one would marry a person from a certain culture/religion realize that they are the bad version of the culture/religion then go on to date another one. I'm sure there are men in that culture/religion that are not like that, but her 2nd pick is just like the 1st."

As for learning English, can't he find an online classroom that's free? 

As for Zied not working, hasn't he earned a ton from cameo.com? He was super popular at the beginning of the year. Unless they blew it all on toys, they should have some savings from it. 

He has to meet the residency requirement before he can study at a non-private trade school. Otherwise, it's about $10k-$20k, isn't it? Also, he was an actor in his home country. Maybe he still wants to be one?"

14895,2020-12-14 15:40:15,kcx545,All of this!!
14896,2020-12-14 14:16:24,kcx545,Hahaha I loved this entire comment. It’s all facts. Zied is unattractive to me. The only attractive foreign spouse I’ve seen is Aladin
14897,2020-12-14 17:15:51,kcx545,He owns his own car in Tunisia.. I remember there was a whole uproar on this sub that Rebegga must have paid for it because it was around the time it came to light she owes child support payments and Ziad claimed he saved up for it and had been saving for like several years
14898,2020-12-14 15:54:58,kcx545,Which is why Zied doesn't want to leave with another man in the house. When your woman likes guys of a certain age you don't want one in the same house with you.
14899,2020-12-14 15:08:30,kcx545,You only get 2 shots at the K1 so if this doesn't work out she'll be forced to look for domestic men instead of imports.
14900,2020-12-14 16:53:42,kcx545,OMG you’ve sent me into a downward spiral I’ll never recover from. Thank you for this. Holy Hell
14901,2020-12-14 15:38:54,kcx545,Right! She’s struggling financially his lack of English is going to truly hinder his job prospects. They’ve been engaged for 2 years and she doesn’t know his favorite game or at least some of the games? For 2 years she didn’t save money knowing this was going to be an expensive process? She’s done it before. For 2 years she didn’t anticipate her lease was coming up? Why not renew the lease. I’d wish she’d come out and say I’m poor and a bad money manager. I just can’t with her
14902,2020-12-14 16:37:03,kcx545,Not several. Jesus take the entire engine
14903,2020-12-14 15:15:50,kcx545,She deserves what she gets

Isn't that women's work???"
14905,2020-12-14 19:16:20,kcx545,Yeah! I said why doesn’t he fix up her house? Forgot she is living with her daughter .. lol
14906,2020-12-14 15:18:03,kcx545,Someone said she’s 52. 🤣🤣 I just can’t with her
14907,2020-12-14 15:23:18,kcx545,Can you imagine have a Tunisian Frankenstein as a stepfather?
14908,2020-12-14 18:01:29,kcx545,It was the debit card that really pushed me. I just about died.

14910,2020-12-14 15:12:46,kcx545,That will mean nothing in the USA. I know surgeons from Russia that are medical assistants because they’re required to go USA med schools. He’ll have to get certified in the US. He’s never held down a real job. This is not a red flag but a red tent punching her in the face.
14911,2020-12-14 14:49:17,kcx545,They both sound like prizes.
14912,2020-12-14 15:08:37,kcx545,Hahaha if only he was a foreigner we could get them on 90DF

14921,2020-12-14 17:18:05,kcx545,He can do online classes and not try to get a degree. Just take a few classes at a community college. Doesn’t need to be a trade school. And $200 on a video game vs that invested in an English course so he can be proficient enough to get a job. Priorities just saying
14922,2020-12-14 19:55:12,kcx545,Yes he does. They took his passport and told him he’ll know in a week
14923,2020-12-14 22:15:15,kcx545,"I actually did scream and people keep saying he lives in a poor country and he has to wait to be able to work or he was a seat filler, he has a job. They’re missing the point that he won’t be able to work for almost 6 months so instead of adding to the burden he should be trying to alleviate it. He should not be demanding his own apt and refusing to live rent free with her daughter. He should’ve worked out a game plan of what to do so he can hit the ground running when he can work. This just proves my point that he’s a lazy leech and will claim he can’t find work like Pole in Brazil because he can’t speak Portuguese but how long has he been there and been with Karine. Ugh these low IQ people should not be procreating"

14926,2020-12-14 17:12:11,kcx545,Did you read my post? If so then you’d know I said during his time he can’t work he should be learning English figuring out what the next steps are. Once they’re married he’ll have to wait 3 months.

14952,2020-12-14 19:25:24,kcx545,I'm in metro Atlanta and I remember the consistent rent raises when I renewed but I'm in a desirable and very populated area. How hard is it to find an apartment in freaking Woodstock? I'm thinking it's all for storyline or those evictions means she has to find a condo or house owner who's willing to work with her and won't run a credit check.
14953,2020-12-14 15:45:42,kcx545,"We had the same issue in Phx, AZ. Our first place was amazing. I loved it and wanted to stay there, but when we went into the office to sign a new lease they stated the rent had went up more than 400 more a month. We were already paying more than most people in the area. We couldn't afford it so had to move. Later found out that they raised the rent to get people to move out as the owner wanted to sell the place, but the company wanting to buy it didn't want renters they wanted rip the place down to build some store. It was cheaper for the company to get people to move out on their own than to have to try and buy everyone in the place out of their lease."
14954,2020-12-14 19:35:59,kcx545,"I grew up around metro Atlanta. Even in Bumblebuck outer limit counties, rent increases without warning. Not just those around the MARTA and public transit lines.

Average rent around Gwinnett was around $150-200/year increase. Complexes know they can get it, either from the renter or the next person in there. And so many large companies own those complexes that it's hard to find an individual. And if you DO find one, it'll still increase. No matter if it's in good condition or not.

Atlanta's bubble needs to burst because prices are ridiculous at all levels. Not just downtown. Gentrification is making it worse. And there's basically no tenant laws to help renters.

It's easy to be evicted when there's no regulation."
14955,2020-12-14 17:04:19,kcx545,I've been to Tunisia and I've been outside of the tourist spots. Seeing what it's like puts things into perspective. It's a beautiful country with great people and well worth a visit. But what you get to see in the nice tourist areas really doesn't reflect the rest of the country.

14958,2020-12-14 19:29:22,kcx545,"I feel like that was to ensure he could pick out his own games. She said she had no idea what kind of games he would like (""maybe soccer?"") and that she didn't know anything about current consoles. I imagine the employee explained that most people buy and download games online now - so she was likely double-checking that she could attach a 'debit card' on this particular system. She never walked out of the store with any hard-copy games, so I imagine the plan was for him to be able to pick some out that he would like without her having to guess. I'm sure TLC included that snippet of conversation though to fit the financial-burden storyline."

15007,2021-03-09 06:15:30,kcx545,I heard TLC pays $500 an episode. It could be more. But if they’re both getting paid that’s an additional money
15008,2020-12-14 20:24:04,kcx545,I'm guessing she did a few ride alongs with her friend and maybe did it very very part-time.
15009,2020-12-14 19:53:07,kcx545,It was her friends business so who knows
15010,2020-12-15 03:20:49,kcx545,We’re all like Rebecca’s friend.
15011,2020-12-14 16:26:25,kcx545,She has his picture on her Visa card.  No way she is not getting married.
15012,2020-12-14 19:04:36,kcx545,"I saw those red flags showing when she went to Tunisia to meet him. He is a control freak, who will use and abuse her, spend up what little money she may have, especially if he finds ways to interfer with her relationships with her adult kids. I strongly suspect he has no intentions of getting a job, but will boss and bully her to keep taking care of him. And she is an idiot for walking into this situation with her eyes wide open."
15013,2020-12-15 04:00:02,kcx545,They’re married. They got married earlier this year.
15014,2020-12-14 21:53:43,kcx545,Completely dead at “Tunisian Frankenstein” 😂
15015,2020-12-15 00:05:15,kcx545,I also promised daily texts of puppy pictures. Covid has kept him at home this year and he's really enjoying the time with the dogs and destressing after classes and homework.
15016,2020-12-14 17:36:49,kcx545,20 years ago I had the entire converted second floor of a victorian house for $600 a month in the middle of nowhere MD. That allowed rottweilers. Not sure what it would go for now.
15017,2020-12-14 18:59:44,kcx545,"This is always my very favorite thing about the internet. It's always fun to compare costs of living and see how much you can get for $X based on location.  I'm a landlord in a college town in the Midwest... which means I can charge a bit more rent than others. I don't have a single unit that's more than $720/mo. $2000/mo would get you an entire house, and not a crappy one either."
15018,2020-12-14 18:43:15,kcx545,My thought was that the owner didn't want his employees that worked for the complex to know he was trying to sell it. Raising the prices that high would ensure people would leave  without his employees also leaving during the process. The place was being ripped down three months after we left.
15019,2020-12-14 17:22:49,kcx545,"So like... How do you want him to save if he's poor in a poor country? Also...

What she doing tho?"
15020,2020-12-14 17:08:05,kcx545,They’ve got to learn to pull themselves up by their bootstraps like the rest of us!
15021,2020-12-14 16:11:50,kcx545,What about Andrei's audacity to demand to be partners with Papa Chuck- instead of an employee? What assets and business acumen is Andrei bringing to this partnership?

15023,2020-12-14 16:24:06,kcx545,Angela is in GA too and in the beginning before all of the spin offs and cameo work there's no way she was making 50k and she has like 85 dependents. I think the financial threshold is much lower than what you think it is.
15024,2021-01-11 08:18:53,kcx545,I did some digging and she is indeed 49

15026,2020-12-14 22:33:45,kcx545,He might be better off improving his english. He'll only understand 1/3rd of the trade school lecture anyway.
15027,2020-12-16 01:52:10,kcx545,Right that's why you were being shady 🙄 girl bye
15028,2020-12-15 04:00:20,kcx545,She’s committed committed 🤣🤣🤣
15029,2020-12-14 19:18:47,kcx545,"I see him being like Andrie when it comes to the job. He will rant and rave about being the man of the house and how he will get a job that pays for everything, but will find very fast that getting a well paying job in the US is not as easy as people over seas think. If he does get a job he won't hold it for long. Likely do to not wanting to follow orders from some one while getting paid less than he wants to get paid. Like a spoil child who gets their first job. After that it will be all about him not taking any job that he could get because it doesn't pay enough or isn't the kind of job he wants to do. The less ""like a man"" he feels the worse he will be with her. 
Wouldn't put it past him to cheat on her as soon as they marry either."
15030,2020-12-14 21:54:19,kcx545,"Unfortunately, she may have a type."
15031,2020-12-15 04:01:08,kcx545,Bingo and she’s already been sending him money. He even needed her money to buy her 💍

15033,2020-12-14 22:16:26,kcx545,He looks and sound like him. Sorry don’t find him or his dad bod attractive
15034,2020-12-15 01:35:53,kcx545,I’ll bet. Mine graduated HS last spring and has decided to wait until things get back to normal.
15035,2020-12-14 21:03:10,kcx545,"Ugh, I get crazy envious when I hear stuff like that!  I live in Burbank, CA & my house is so tiny.  I know I could have a full blown mansion somewhere else😩!  The house across the street from me was recently remodeled.  Its 3 bed 3 bath under 2000 sq ft (twice the size of my house, but still not *that* big).  It just sold for $1.3 million!  WTF?  How can someone afford to spend so much on so little?  If I paid a million dollars for a house, I would expect it to be HUGE & amazing with a pool & everything!  It’s just a small understated house!"
15036,2020-12-14 17:33:19,kcx545,Anything is better than nothing. He literally does not work. He has no work ethic. I’m just so confused at all the excuses people are giving this man child. Mine blown. I would never bring another person to this country that can’t show some form of work ethic especially one I’m financially responsible for for 10 years.
15037,2020-12-14 16:18:51,kcx545,Maybe he has experience with bribes? Though his experience is probably more to do with accepting bribes than bribing others.
15038,2020-12-14 16:45:39,kcx545,"Depends on the quality of life you want. To me it is, because with taxes you’re looking at $40k but in Georgia it’s probably a good living. Especially in Woodstock"
15039,2020-12-14 16:30:08,kcx545,"She could be making that as a manager and 50k isn’t a lot. Her children are all grown. She has no legal dependents. The financial threshold is above poverty limits. You have to remember this person is responsible for this immigrant for 10 years. Meaning they cannot apply for any government assistance so it’s not a low threshold.

EDIT: Sorry I thought you were talking about Rebecca. Angela must have some money or savings because she bought that new house she moved into from Happily Ever After. Also Angela and Mykhal’s k1 got denied which is why they’re trying the spousal visa and also why she got married in Nigeria"
15040,2020-12-14 15:41:02,kcx545,Yes I was 💀.
15041,2020-12-15 03:30:54,kcx545,"He was doing an HVAC course (saw someone post it from his gram), so it's possible he will get a job here."
15042,2020-12-15 04:02:00,kcx545,He’ll blame his lack of English like Pole is using as to why he can’t get a job in Brazil
15043,2020-12-15 05:31:38,kcx545,"She's probably not getting much play from American men but these Middle Eastern men are desperate to get a green card and get to the United States. They'll say anything and do anything to make their partner fall for it and that's where Rebecca is and has been. 

Every older woman and the younger foreign counterparts have been the examples of this."
15044,2020-12-15 01:41:17,kcx545,His school does an online degree program normally that is pretty robust so I feel like they were better prepared than schools that are just on the ground. He wouldn't have been able to defer for an entire year without reapplying and having to go through scholarship applications again. Also he's high risk so I didn't want him getting a job or playing video games for a year. He had the option of going to campus and taking classes remotely but he chose to do it from home. His therapists said it was important to let him make the decision.
15045,2020-12-14 18:12:32,kcx545,"He does work. We've seen photos of him on TV sets doing his audience filler gig. He also was learning hvac systems after last season aired, but that was from social media posted here and not shown on the TV show. Tunisia has a very high unemployment rate, so working odd jobs isn't necessarily a sign anything is off with him. It does lead me to question his motives for being with her more, but he also does genuinely seem attracted to her. I think these two have issues for other reasons, but his lack of steady work history isn't the problem."
15046,2020-12-14 17:34:33,kcx545,"Lol, it's not really an excuse. It's an objective look at a situation as an outsider. Considering both sides. You just can't see that because you're being overly dramatic about a situation you aren't even involved in. Calm down a bit."
15047,2020-12-14 18:52:39,kcx545,"> I’m just so confused at all the excuses people are giving this man child. Mine blown. 

I don't think there is anything shocking about the fact that fans of a show about gaining perspective through learning about other cultures are asking you to consider the social and cultural context of why Zied's work history isn't in great shape.

If you think that providing context or an explanation is always ""making excuses"" for people then I question whether you're the best person to be facilitating a discussion about naive Americans."
15048,2020-12-14 16:37:38,kcx545,Her K1 didn't get denied for financial reasons. They didn't believe that their relationship was legit. If it was denied for financial reasons applying for a spousal would also get denied. Angela was working 2 jobs to afford to sponsor Michael and her trip to Nigeria. Her new house was only 165k and she had been doing cameo and had done 3 seasons when she bought it. She's making a lot more now than she did when she first appeared and applied.
15049,2020-12-14 15:42:15,kcx545,"Same! Especially after she made that big to-do on the first episode! I'm 47, er, no, I'm 49. UM, NO, YOU ARE 52, LADY! GAWD."

15051,2020-12-15 04:07:25,kcx545,"I never said he won't get a job. I'm saying he won't like the job he gets just like Andrie did. He won't like being told what to do by his boss. He also won't like being the new guy at work that gets the crappy hours, pay, ect. that most people have to deal with in their first job or new job."
15052,2020-12-15 04:05:09,kcx545,Not if he can’t speak English and his English is horrible. That $200 could’ve been used on Rosetta Stone or some English course. He’s in racist ass conservative ass Georgia. You could see the disdain in her daughter’s boyfriend face when he was talking about adjusting. His lack of English along with the fact that he’s middle eastern Muslim is going to be a big hindrance for him and Rebecca is too stupid to have this discussion with him. They’re set up for failure. He can’t get on government assistance so they’re screwed.
15053,2020-12-15 02:41:32,kcx545,"We could talk! Mine is doing community college, so no worries about apps or GPAs etc. ADHD+ makes online really tough. Luckily the “risk” part has calmed down a bit, but we were right there with ya for a long while. He’s working his first real job, so not much time for anything else. And he is getting artwork of his cat for Xmas!"
15054,2020-12-14 20:05:20,kcx545,"""Mine blown"""
15055,2020-12-14 16:51:24,kcx545,They didn’t give a reason why it was denied actually. Her lawyer told her to wait and try to determine why it was denied to see if something Michael was hiding that she didn’t know about before marrying him. 25k is still too low to sponsor someone. You have to be above poverty level income wise.
15056,2020-12-14 15:47:33,kcx545,🤣🤣🤣
15057,2020-12-14 16:46:36,kcx545,Apparently
15058,2020-12-15 13:07:05,kcx545,Mine has ADHD also. The meds help a lot. His classes are 2.5 hours long. We've learned not to schedule classes after 5pm.
15059,2020-12-14 17:07:08,kcx545,The poverty level for 2 people in GA is a little less than 17k. 25k would be more than enough.

15095,2020-12-14 04:17:35,kcoa6d,"Almost done with what will probably be my last rewatch for awhile and I mostly agree. I think the Philly storyline is actually not too bad. Marital problems is just about the last thing that could still be done with Jim and Pam and it worked pretty well.

The part that leaves a bad taste in my mouth is Andy. I never liked him much in earlier seasons, but I absolutely despised him in the last 1.5 seasons. Everything bad that happens to him is 100% his fault, but afterwards he just...sticks around. There's no arc, and even if there was, I don't want to see S9 Andy succeed. I don't even want to see him fail. I legitimately just want him off my TV. He actively harms the show."
15096,2020-12-14 02:31:13,kcoa6d,"https://tenor.com/tPMD.gif

I agree 100%! It's definitely not an amazing season, but it still has some really funny moments. It reminds me a little of moving on to the next grade. You're still in the same school, but there are different classmates, new teacher. It'll never feel the same as it did before, it's just different. The only terrible part was Andy's character assassination."
15097,2020-12-14 03:18:19,kcoa6d,"I’d rather watch season 9 of the. Office then like, river dale or any of that crap"
15098,2020-12-14 03:14:57,kcoa6d,I think season 8 was the worst. They just left Michael and then brought in Robert California who I don't really think added anything positive to the series. It was kinda a sad time.
15099,2020-12-27 22:36:13,kcoa6d,I just finished season 9 now after watchjng the rest of the series when it aired on TV. I actually liked it as well. Andy also has one of the best quotes: I wish there was a way to know that youre in the good old days before youve left them
15100,2020-12-14 13:46:05,kcoa6d,"I agree 100 percent.  I hadn't watched the show since it aired but rewatched the whole thing after finding out it would be leaving netflix.  After michael scott leaves the show definitely dips in quality,   but there's still a lot of great moments.  I think dwight carried the show towards the end and we see some of his best moments.  The jim/pam struggles were sad at times but made it feel like the characters had some real growth."
15101,2020-12-14 02:15:24,kcoa6d,"After what an awful person Andy was leading up to his crash, he deserved everything he got in season 9. I was kinda on board with you until that next to last paragraph. 

With that said, I liked 9 as well. It’s still the office, even though it’s not as good as previous seasons it’s still better than a lot of other tv shows."

15115,2020-12-14 00:44:02,kcjnsr,"Reporting on Melania accurately isn’t offensive, she’s just a really shitty person."
15116,2020-12-14 01:28:19,kcjnsr,"There was that one report about Melania's ""Be Best"" anti-bullying campaign on those channels. Followed up by Trump's bully-like statements on Twitter and footage of him making fun of a disabled reporter. Can you call facts biased? Oh yeah, and Melania saying fuck Christmas. So First Lady-like. But let's talk about Michelle's shoulders."

The most you could blame on the other news outlets is lower coverage, but then that's fair. What has Melania done or achieved in her time? Not a lot.

At first, I thought perhaps English wasn’t your first language, and it’s not uncommon for people with less-than-fluent command of any language to only be able to engage with the larger, broad points of a conversation. But I don’t think that’s that case here, is it?

The point is that the whole Michelle Obama is a man thing is a obvious troll.

15188,2020-12-12 22:18:27,kbxbc4,"What happened is that ASP used the story that she had planned as the Season 7 finale. She added the stupid musical because she loves Sutton Foster. She treated Melissa McCarthy like crap so we got a whole 10 minutes of Sookie. Lorelei would NEVER do a ""Wild"" hiking trek or try to convince Luke they needed to have a baby by a surrogate. Other than Emily's story, AYITL was a terrible disappointment. AYITL was a one & done viewing experience."
15189,2020-12-12 21:29:13,kbxbc4,It’s like they didn’t want there to be growth unless we saw it. It makes the show even less believable if they want us to accept that basically all of the characters we care about are going to be affected by a plot fog for a decade and not change or improve themselves.
15190,2020-12-12 22:28:07,kbxbc4,Yeah I hated the revival it was so dark and sooo much filler. Like what was with that play I fast forwarded the whole time. The whole revival was disappointing. I know the creator wanted to end the series with rorys pregnancy but she should have evolved the ending with the character.
15191,2020-12-13 16:12:28,kbxbc4,"I loved Emily’s storyline and Lorelai’s phone call with her about her favorite memory of Richard. I actually thought the musical was hilarious, and it was very much in the spirit of the original season. It reminded me of the Stars Hallow museum. I very much understand the complaint that the storyline was a total time suck, when they could’ve been doing character development and meaningful conversations. 

Everything else was kinda blah, as far as I’m concerned. I hated that Rory got pregnant. I think “full circle” concepts have to be more subtle or they come off as lazy storytelling. Lor had an unplanned pregnancy by Chris and chose to go it alone, and now RoRy hAd aN unPlanneD pRegNancY by LoGan anD cHoSe to go it AlOne! JeSS iS heR LuKe! Symmetry! Get it? Yuck.  No thanks. Just me?"
15192,2020-12-13 13:05:53,kbxbc4,"I think the Lorelai/Luke plot is what puzzled me the most. It is like they learned nothing from the significant communication issues they had the first time around (who seriously would not have discussed children at all, not once, after being together that long?). They seemed to just be living one day at a time with no future planning at all. For Rory, I do think the point was to show how lost she had gotten over the years, and that she kind of spiraled into this wandering lifestyle and lost who she was. The book, and coming home, was a way to re-center her. I think she was still pretty childish, especially in her romantic relationships, but I could kind of see where they were trying to go. I think it would have fit better if Rory had been in her early/mid twenties, vs her 30s, but maybe that's just because I wouldn't have thought it would take her 10 years to figure it out, or that Lorelai would have called her on it earlier. I still liked the revival overall, but yea some kind of strange choices that didn't quite seem to fit the characters if 10 years had really passed."
15193,2020-12-13 18:16:59,kbxbc4,"My biggest issue was that Rory inherited all this money and is rich - so wth is with her being a lost, poor kid. Also, she is like in her 30s (late 20s?) but they make her character seems like she is 22, just out of college..."
15194,2020-12-12 21:41:02,kbxbc4,"I agree it was a little depressing-it might be realistic but that's not what we all fell in love with! The show was always a little on the quirky, even magical side but this was like a bad hangover!"
15195,2020-12-14 13:42:12,kbxbc4,"I always got the feeling, that ASP used many ideas she had in mind for S7 / a possible S8 for the revival. She maybe never thought about filling the gaps between the series' finale and the revival and just went through with the story she had planned for a twenty-something Rory and pushing 40 Lorelai. That's probably why everything seems a bit *off* in the revival. 

Of course she had to come up with a new storyline for Emily - maybe that's why her story arc is the best in AYITL."
15196,2020-12-13 05:34:10,kbxbc4,it’s depressing because the characters are all pretty insane along with their lives
15197,2020-12-13 01:22:36,kbxbc4,I agree Emily’s plot was actually satisfying. She grew and tried to find peace and share her love for her family in a new way. And she’s trying new things and letting others in. It was refreshing. Everything else felt stagnant and forced.
15198,2020-12-12 22:28:06,kbxbc4,I think people forget ASP always intended to end the series with rory pregnant
15199,2020-12-13 18:15:31,kbxbc4,Melissa absolutely sucked in the revival though...Sookie was so disappointing. 10 mins was enough. The Sutton/musical thing was BS though.

15201,2020-12-12 22:31:33,kbxbc4,Agreed
15202,2020-12-13 18:19:07,kbxbc4,Full circle = lack of ideas.
15203,2020-12-13 19:22:01,kbxbc4,"I think Rory's pregnancy would've maybe made sense in the original show - even if Rory was a college grad, it still would've been young-ish... I guess an interesting full circle that even though she was raised so differently and Lorelei wanted her to have a different life, she ended up in a similarish situation. Though Lorelei would've helped 22-yr-old pregnant Rory while 16-yr-old pregnant Lorelei left her parents...also, still in HS and college grad is still a HUGE difference... But I can understand the idea, especially that she had this idea very early on, when they didn't know the show was going to go on for a long time (maybe originally she expected a HS or early college pregnancy? then held onto the idea?). But for  the 10 years later revival it absolutely made NO sense, it wasn't even full circle....it was just laziness not to think about how Rory's life could be in her 30s and letting her break away from her college/HS boyfriends..."
15204,2020-12-13 16:13:28,kbxbc4,Completely agree.
15205,2020-12-13 13:18:50,kbxbc4,"Agreed it was puzzling.  After the first proposal and everything that happened.  
Essentially they broke up because Luke kept postponing the wedding.  Then they finally get back together and they’ve been together for 10 years and all that time he hasn’t proposed.  I mean she made the gesture the first time and I agree with her I wouldn’t do it again.  Then he gives his big speech about how he’s all in if you’re all in why is it been for years and you still haven’t proposed.  It tells me that in all this time they never addressed any of their issues.  It also tells me and all this time he hasn’t taken the initiative to make their relationship permanent"
15206,2020-12-13 18:49:46,kbxbc4,Well I know she got her trust at 25. Richard mentions it.  I would have assumed she got something when he died but it is possible he left everything to Emily.  I know Lorelei didn’t apparently get much because she needs the money he left Luke.
15207,2020-12-12 22:28:16,kbxbc4,Yes agreed.  Also agree it’s like show changed genres
15208,2020-12-14 14:11:39,kbxbc4,Completely possible
15209,2020-12-13 12:33:49,kbxbc4,Agreed
15210,2020-12-12 22:30:45,kbxbc4,I didn’t forget I honestly didn’t know originally and when the show came back I read an article where she said that and I was like ok.  But I’m not sure I think it was a good idea.  By that I don’t mean Rory being pregnant.  I mean starting a show knowing you’re going to end with one plot point without considering all the surprises and growth that didn’t necessary organically bring you to that point
15211,2020-12-13 14:29:46,kbxbc4,Right. I feel like we needed more background on how they ended up where they were.
15212,2020-12-13 18:51:28,kbxbc4,I am guessing her trust is plenty. Though I guess she is flying to Logan all the time...
15213,2020-12-13 00:12:46,kbxbc4,I knew it for awhile. ASP basically in my mind said lemme redo season 7 and this is gonna be my make up for it lol. It would have been good to end the series like that not end the revival like it imo
15214,2020-12-13 14:30:30,kbxbc4,Exactly
15215,2020-12-13 18:53:02,kbxbc4,There probably is but trust are usually allotted.  Meaning she gets a monthly stipend from it. It makes sense why she’s not in a hurry to take any job.
15216,2020-12-13 00:15:43,kbxbc4,Agreed

 For context: I (22f) live in my grandmas guest house and help her take care of 13 horses, it’s kind of my job during the quarantine. Mentioned Aunt is my grandmas sister so uncle is her BIL, cousin is their daughter. 


   Christmas has always been rough with my family. Last year(pre covid) my grandma, mom and I traveled out of state super sick, and were super miserable. We got into a huge fight with my racist uncle (something about women of color not needing to be as smart as white men to get through life, Michelle Obama looking like a gorilla, and his SIL looking like an ”Arab terrorist” because he had a beard). The year before that my mom and grandma got into a drunk fight about years of anger and neglect. So we were hoping for a calm Small Christmas, with no drama......:(


   This year on December 3rd my grandma told my mom and I that my cousin and her boyfriend would be coming on the 16th and would be staying to the 29th. Then said “the bad news is your Uncle and Aunt will most likely be coming at some point as well”. My mom and I made it very clear we would not spend Christmas with my A&U and we would not come over while he was here. She talked to my Aunt and it sounded like he understood we weren’t comfortable with him being here and said she should go alone. Well now my cousin will be here tomorrow (the 13th) and my Aunt AND Uncle will be here for 5 days (16-20). Not only does this mean I will miss out on all of the Christmas baking, but I wont be able to do the one thing that gets me out of the house without them being there (the horses) they go when they’re in town. I am fine with being around my cousin, but I won’t be around A&U until there is an Acknowledgment of the fucked up things that were said and that my aunt tried to lie about the context of the conversation so her husband wouldn’t seem like the villain. 


   You may ask “Why can’t you just deal with it and ignore them.” Well I’m glad you asked, my uncle spent my entire childhood making me feel unwelcome and like a burden. So when I got older I made the decision to not have them in my life, and his racist tirade last Christmas further set that decision in stone. 


  Am I the Asshole for asking my grandma to tell my uncle to stay home? I feel it’s unfair I have to miss everything I helped her plan and put together (thinking he wasn’t going to come), and that I have to hide in my house and hope not to run into them when he uses the tools in my garage and smokes on my front porch. 
Sorry if any of this is unclear, I’m in a brain fog and still upset.

15222,2020-12-12 20:29:02,kbw7qx,"NTA he seems to make a hostile environment and your grandma may feel a bit upset and bias because he is her child, but she should realize that him coming would make the household hostile."

That's not an aunt. An aunt would be your parent's sister. Your grandmother's sister is your grandaunt. 

>  so uncle is her BIL, cousin is their daughter. 

Nope, and nope. Your grandmother's BIL is your granduncle, and his daughter would be your first cousin once removed."

15242,2020-12-12 08:27:39,kbkx7s,"Probably not the case here, but people often use podcasts as a way to smuggle leaked/removed songs onto the app. Also might be a good way to listen to only the songs you want if you don’t have premium. If you’re not surprised that Logan Paul is popping up in your recommended, then I’m not surprised some kids fortnite playlist is there too. It is a pretty heavy inconvenience though, as I rarely ever listen to podcasts, and it’s always right in front of you when you log in."
15243,2020-12-12 08:13:54,kbkx7s,Actually i almost never use the podcast part of the app. Just ignore it until it gets good
15244,2020-12-12 12:12:27,kbkx7s,"I'm in fact so damn tired of this that I stopped using the Desktop app for the Web player, and made a quick css script (replied with the steps below) that hides anything related to podcasts - sections with ""shows"" and stuff like this - gone.

Well, they're still in the mobile app which sucks, but since I've been at home for months and probably will still be, it's fine for now. Hopefully that gets reduced in a couple of weeks because I never listen to podcasts or subscribed to one on Spotify and I'm done with it."
15245,2020-12-12 14:11:58,kbkx7s,"Agreed! I don't use podcasts, I only use the music portion. I can't concentrate on podcasts at work and wish Spotify would stop shoving it in my face."
15246,2020-12-12 16:30:02,kbkx7s,"At first I try to ignore it. But for someone who listens to 'zero' podcasts, they have push me to the limit now where I just don't want to open the 'Home' tab anymore. It started with a regular normal artwork size, then comes the bigger ones. And now I see just two of them filling up half of my screen size. THIS,  IS SERIOUSLY GETTING OUT OF HAND."
15247,2020-12-12 16:31:46,kbkx7s,"Spotify is probably the worst music streaming service out there from a software perspective. But paying only 2,50€ a month makes it still a good deal and stops me from switching to another service. Can't really complain for that price."
15248,2020-12-12 16:47:09,kbkx7s,"I just opened my Desktop app and I see nothing of the sort.  I have 2020 wrapped, top shows bar, made for you and based on fan like of a band I listen to.

I am not saying your wrong but I haven't seen this.  Then again I have premium because I can't stand ads.   

Do you not have premium?  Maybe this is being aggressively pushed on free users?"
15249,2020-12-12 17:27:19,kbkx7s,I've only seen the recommended podcasts section once in months lol...
15250,2020-12-12 18:00:21,kbkx7s,"Never had an issue you guys are talking about with podcasts. I stopped using the app for podcasts anyway a year or two ago. Only issue I see is random home screen ad for the usual suspects I.e Michelle Obama etc and those podcasts Spotify probably paid big money to acquire. Politics aside if I as a corporation paid big money to acquire rights to a particular podcast, I’m going to push the fuck out of it to maximize what I spent. And if you don’t like said podcast for whatever it is, then just scroll away from it. It’s not like these podcasts are gripping you by the balls and forcing to you listen."
15251,2020-12-12 19:35:45,kbkx7s,Homescreen personalisation for Spotify would fix all the problems just let us choose the segments we want to show up and in witch order
15252,2020-12-12 16:43:48,kbkx7s,"Spotify doesn’t have to pay out royalties for podcasts, but they do for music. They’re trying to keep the listeners on the app without having to large overhead of paying royalties to the record labels."
15253,2020-12-12 17:47:17,kbkx7s,"fucking NO I DON'T WANT TO LISTEN TO JOE ROGAN OR MY FAVORITE MURDER, SPOTIFY"
15254,2020-12-13 03:07:32,kbkx7s,lol this is an up vote from the Doorknob Podcast.  I agree with this actually - not a fan of things pushed on people.
15255,2020-12-12 14:07:04,kbkx7s,"I think its a mind thing. Like when you've tied your shoes 3 times already but the left foot still feels tight for some reason.

They see it and then focus on it too much.

Because I still don't have this issue...and just don't see it being this big.

Plus I wonder if any spotify employees who work on the app browse here? I doubt it, but you never know. And if so, still better to write these up on their site and post a link here for all to vote on. Since that's how they take in their complaints and comments."
15256,2020-12-12 13:38:29,kbkx7s,Same
15257,2020-12-12 17:47:39,kbkx7s,"I don't have it either. I think I've had two podcasts recommended to me as pop-ups. I mean, I'd prefer not to be advertised to when I'm paying for a service, but I have never seen this as intrusive or anything. I just ignore them and move onto the content I'm actually listening to."
15258,2020-12-12 08:38:18,kbkx7s,Yeah that’s facts. Also when I said about the Logan Paul thingy I meant that his and Michelle Obama’s podcasts are always being recommended
15259,2020-12-12 14:32:19,kbkx7s,"Bro drop the script please, I'm so tired seeing all these podcast, damn man, I never heard a single of them and that's all I see"
15260,2020-12-12 08:48:38,kbkx7s,I’ve found it’s kinda just really strange at times with them sometimes too. I listened to the misfits podcast for thirty minutes and I can’t stop getting scp foundation database readings?

Eddie has has literally had hit movies (yes, along with several bombs) in each of the past four decades (although he almost missed this one if he hadn't lucked out with Dolomite last year). In the 80's he was the first Black actor to be the #1 box office draw. Most of our successful Black comedians today, including Chappelle, count him as an influence. In terms of Black comedic figures, I don't see how anyone could be ranked higher than him?

I'd probably replace Tupac with Dr. Dre, looking at his impact on hip-hop from the beginnings of NWA, to Death Row, to his work after that all the way up to the Beats By Dre deal. 

Russell? I guess I can see the argument for him, with his role in launching the career of Run-DMC, the first ""crossover"" rap act, the creation of  Def Jam, and all the careers that launched, not to mention Def Comedy Jam, a groundbreaking idea at the time, as well as Phat Farm, probably the first hip-hop related fashion company. So from a behind-the-scenes level he's made a big impact. I could see an argument for replacing him with Sean Combs, whatever he's calling himself these days, as he made himself a public figure in addition to his various business deals."

It's a tough world for trans people and especially trans women. Many stay closeted for their own safety and they don't really owe anyone their medical history except in specific and often personal circumstances.

I recommend you think about why it makes you uncomfortable. Might help you address some unconscious biases.

She’s also a multi-time Ivy League grad, led a number of very visible public policy initiatives as FLOTUS, and remains a successful author and public commentator since leaving the White House. She’s pretty much the gold standard for First Ladies.

Also Trump only got most admired after 300,000 dead due to Covid and his attempts to over throw close to 250 years of democracy, so it calls into question what exactly people admire. Was it the facist tendencies? Or the utter incompetence during the pandemic?"

And to me, people who say this about not accepting the kinds of differences of opinion or bad behaviours you list are crying wolf.  

Because it's absolutely possible that I *am* kind of intolerant and inflexible, but it's harder to figure out whether I am or not, and what to do about it, if the majority of the time I'm criticised for it, the thing I'm being pressured to accept isn't actually acceptable to a decent person.

Personally, I weigh things up by assessing how harmful they are, and use that to try to figure out how tolerant/accepting I should be of them.  And that seems to work, on the whole.  But then that means that the only times I get told to be more accepting are when the idea's being used to try to shut me up so I don't rock the boat.  Because the things I *should* be more accepting of, I - for the most part - already am."
15553,2020-12-30 06:17:04,kmroqe,I just assumed (yes I know that assuming stuff normally a bad idea) that when people say “you just don’t respect different opinions” is because they are used to different reactions.

But all of this looks to me like a corporate attempt to push her forward as a future POTUS, just like they did with Hillary Clinton. But both she and Clinton are part of the right wing of the democratic party, along with Biden. The establishment wing. 

For all the flak Barack got for being ""liberal,"" he was a faithful servant of the upper class, and didn't do anything against their interests, while doing plenty that hurt the poorer folks. I see zero indication that she would be any different.

There are lots of younger, progressive women out there who deserve our support, because they will reward it by helping us, instead of those who are all too capable of helping themselves."

She has not held any office or ever run for one.  She has however, worked hard for the rights of women and girls world wide.

15576,2020-12-30 03:41:54,kmookx,"If you never hear anything about her it is because you are ignoring her accomplishments and work.   She is a progressive and she has done much to make the world a better place.  It is so easy for people like you, who have almost surely not done a fraction of what Michelle Obama has to help people, to gripe and say that she is part of the right wing establishment."
15577,2020-12-30 03:53:24,kmookx,"I'm not specifically ignoring her work, in contrast to anyone else's. And you're quite correct that she is far more accomplished than I am. But as a voter and an American citizen, it is my right and my responsibility to make judgments about the people who may be offered as leaders.

I say she is part of the establishment because of the policies her husband actually supported while he was in office. (In contrast to the pretty words he spoke.)

I have no wish to tear her down. I just don't want her as president. I didn't want Harris or Biden, either, although all of these people are infinitely preferable to any republican.

I don't really have much optimism about the future, especially of the USA, mainly because the super-wealthy essentially own the government. On that point, both parties are part of the same machine. They fight tooth and nail over the scraps, and obviously Trump is an outlier, but in the end, the masters are always served."

Assuming her Wikipedia presence is maintained by someone who cares about her public image (a fairly safe bet for any public figure,) her accomplishments should be pretty up to date. According to this, she's written a book and made some speeches. Pretty standard fare for rich people of her background. I'm back to thinking she hasn't done anything to challenge the aristocracy.

In the 74 times Gallup has asked the open-ended most admired man question since 1946, the incumbent president has topped the list 60 times. Harry Truman (1946-1947 and 1950-1952), Lyndon Johnson (1967-1968), Richard Nixon (1973), Gerald Ford (1974-1975), Jimmy Carter (1980), George W.

>Even though **Trump is similarly unpopular now** \-- [39% approve of his performance](https://news.gallup.com/poll/328106/public-mood-sours-satisfied-approve-trump.aspx) \-- **his dominant performance among Republicans, contrasted with Democrats splitting their choices** among multiple public figures, pushes him to the top of the 2020 most admired man list.

IOW, the top-line takeaway - ""Trump most admired!"" is deeply misleading if interpreted as a metric of Trumpers vs. non-Trumpers, because the non-Trump vote is split, whereas (of course) all of the Trumpers are all in on Trump.

>Forty-eight percent of Republicans name Trump this year, with *no other public figure receiving more than 2% of Republicans' votes*.

In a top-two runoff, it's obvious from the data that Obama would trounce Trump as the ""most admired man"". The only reason Trump edged Obama in the crowded field this year is because more Democrats broke away from Obama to name Joe Biden as their most-admired man, splitting the Democratic vote.

>Obama is the top choice among Democrats, at 32%, but that is down from 41% last year. President-elect Joe Biden (13%) is also commonly named by Democrats.

Anthony Fauci probably also eats into a good amount of the vote that'd go to Obama in a top-two matchup. I can't imagine many/any Trump supporters would've voted for Fauci as their hero."

15603,2020-12-29 21:48:29,kmnkfb,"This kind of list is meaningless for me, no matter who is out there."
15604,2020-12-29 21:46:49,kmnkfb,"That’s exactly it. Michelle, Kamala, Barack, and Joe *each* received considerable proportions. There were no other republicans mentioned. Combined, they utterly wallop Trump."
