107,2020-02-05 22:14:15,eyu4sr,I only do paypal (I send the invoice and I'll pay the G&S fee). It would be 13 shipped.
108,2020-03-05 03:58:26,eys56h,I haven’t personally but I know that in the drag scene it is super popular for this purpose. Apparently it does not budge :) I think Trixie Mattel mentioned it in a video with J.
109,2020-02-04 15:29:49,eyrf7x,"only 160 tattoos?  Shit, lil wayne has atleast that on just his face  


If you google lil wayne tattoos you cant ever find an answer.  Ive seen 59, 103, 172 and 364 just on the front page of google"
110,2020-02-04 17:20:20,eyrf7x,Are the accolades confirmed to still be trustworthy after season 2? I remember seeing some posts where people said they didn't add up but I never looked very much into them.
111,2020-02-04 19:50:50,eyrf7x,I hope he never comes on the show anyway.
112,2020-02-04 21:18:14,eyrf7x,omg thank you its not jeffre star
113,2020-02-04 23:17:43,eyrf7x,"I was under the impression that those stats were just for group A, not all combined."
114,2020-02-04 18:05:31,eyrf7x,"Part of me wonders if Night Angel is >!Leslie Jones!<. In the promo pic, NA's body double's left leg is thicker than the right one, and >!Leslie!< has a knee brace on that leg, so I wonder if they padded the double's leg to make it look like she has a knee brace on."
115,2020-02-04 17:42:27,eyrf7x,"Let's also keep in mind that Jeffree star is running a dang business right now and has talked about how a lot of new products are launching early 2020. I think our queen is too busy to be doing this show. As much as we'd love it, he has a make up empire to run and just bought a new house around the time filming would have happened along with the release of Shane's lines and his company anniversary highlighters."
116,2020-02-09 23:52:31,eyrf7x,"Yeah, I think it’s Sister James but they’re gonna pull a RuPaul and Seal on us. I’m not happy about it, but it makes sense. Sister said on insta he had some “top secret meetings” in December. It’s possible Jeffree was lined up for the show, but after the break up, told production that he couldn’t handle it, and they called the next token YouTuber on the list"
117,2020-02-04 15:40:39,eyrf7x,A lot of this is because it’s difficult to tell if one small tattoo that gets things added on over time counts as one or as multiple
118,2020-02-05 17:47:28,eyrf7x,Yeah for sure. Wayne easily has at least 160 tattoos. The man stays getting new ink. He probably couldnt tell you how many he has. Wiz khalifa is covered but no one covered like wayne
119,2020-02-07 00:39:41,eyrf7x,Lmao I think I read somewhere that Lil Wayne has like 84 total tattoos?
120,2020-02-05 00:17:50,eyrf7x,Same. I'm going to get downvoted to hell for this but I'd much rather see an LGBT icon that hasn't had any racist scandals and isn't constantly embroiled in drama with everyone they ever called a friend at one point.
121,2020-02-05 11:08:23,eyrf7x,"I have no logic behind this, but when I saw  Kangaroo and Night Angel and thought both were black women. Again, I have no reasoning other than a random thought that just a random vibe.  If it's Leslie i'd be thrilled."
122,2020-02-09 23:53:57,eyrf7x,"The waist looks very masculine. It’s possible it’s a guy who likes androgynous fashion, maybe a certain Sister who’s been thinking he’s hot shit and posting photos in drag recently."
123,2020-02-09 23:56:35,eyrf7x,"Also he broke up with his boyfriend right around when he would’ve had to say yes to the show. It’s possible he’s been invited but said, maybe next season, to production. 

Although his BFF Shane did say on his IG story March would be a big month (when Night Angel would be unmasked if they don’t make it to top 9), which is weird, considering Jeffree’s highly anticipated Blood Sugar 3 is probably coming out this month, not in March."
124,2020-02-05 00:39:35,eyrf7x,Totally agree. That's why I said what I did I just didn't include the context lol.
125,2020-02-05 11:50:57,eyrf7x,"Part of me thinks that she's too skinny and tall for the costume but the other part of me is like ""Miss Monster looks skinnier in the promo pic than on the actual show!"" She also hasn't posted anything about TMS yet (which she usually does) and has talked about how she's currently in pain and might need knee surgery soon (a consequence?).

I also think Swan is black."
126,2020-02-09 23:58:25,eyrf7x,"If >!Leslie!< isn't Night Angel and your assumptions are correct, I think >!she'll!< be either T-Rex or Bear. >!She appeared on Fallon the day before Group C filming started, and did not do any filming/photos during group C qualifier dates, except for a few throwaway tweets. She also hasn't posted ANYTHING about the show this season, and she became a massive fan during S2. So I don't know if she's on and hiding it or if she's just lost interest in it, but something seems sus.!<"
127,2020-02-10 02:57:40,eyrf7x,"Honestly, I think they’ll play Night Angel like Leopard from last season, feeding the judges with info that it’s JS but really it’ll be Sister James. I don’t know Leslie, but if she is on it, T Rex has a slim waist, so if she’s got a figure for days, maybe that’s her."

I mentioned this to another user the other day, but you are not allowed to ask buyers to covers fees. They must be taken into consideration with your price.

233,2020-02-01 10:23:13,ex3e9l,"Maybe this will help you all theorize:


Premium $60 (White and red box) - Contains 4 items (3 exclusives). Retail value: $105
Deluxe $100 (Red with white box) - Contains 8 items (3 exclusives). Retail value: $199
Supreme $145 (Pink and white box) - Contains 12 items (5 exclusives). Retail value: $285
 

The non-exclusive in the Premium box will ""make us Gag"". 

He said that every box will have an exclusive cosmetic item which makes me think Premium will only have one (maybe either the gloss or liquid lip), and deluxe will get the Gloss and Liquid lip, and Supreme both lippies as well as one exclusive highlighter or palette.

The non exclusive item that will make you Gag may either be the Mini Controversy (that they need to move because the new version is coming) or optimistically maybe an Extreme Frost (in ""Gag me""?)"

238,2020-02-01 10:37:17,ex3e9l,"I kind of doubt they’ll include the mini controversy since it’s a collab though. I already have it so I don’t want it to start haha. Correct me if I’m wrong, but in the past none of the boxes contain the same exclusive, all are different since a lot of people tend to purchase each size so it wouldn’t make sense to get multiples of the same product. Hence, one exclusive cosmetic *per* box. 

In my post I analyzed the prices and my guesses match exactly, except for the deluxe, off by $1 so I’ve probably got a few wrong items. An Extreme frost would be great in premium, but retails for $50 so the other 3 items would have to all equal up to $55 which isn’t much for that amount of items. I guess it’s possible, though."
239,2020-02-01 20:26:52,ex3e9l,"As said in post, Jeffree revealed two of the three cosmetic exclusives; the usual excl VLL and a new excl gloss, but didn’t say which boxes they’re in. So I wonder if the other exclusive cosmetic could be a skin frost, or even an extreme frost. 

And after I did the totals I’m like 90% sure the clothing item in deluxe will be a t-shirt. Maybe the hearts hoodie design? Either way I’m excited to see what’s in them."
240,2020-02-05 21:06:38,ex3e9l,"Agreed, it’s a bit disappointing but at the same time I feel like some people expect too much from the boxes and get upset when expectations were set too high. Although, I agree it’s a little lackluster so hopefully the others will be worth it"
241,2020-02-01 10:39:04,ex3e9l,"Maybe two lippies and a set of straws equals $55?

I've never been a part of any of these mystery boxes before so I didn't realize that he had different exclusive items in the different boxes that's pretty cool."

Instead, it is stuff he is trying to get rid of to make room for all the new products that he is coming out with. Which I get and it doesn't bother me. It gives me a chance to hopefully get something that I may not have. But 2 things in the box I already have. Which is the glass and mini pallet. The 1 exclusive I don't feel is an exclusive -.- The only difference is that it is made of a different material than the one on his website so that's a huge let down."

It’s a nice way to try out different colors/formulas you might not have bought itself. Sometimes there’s some vivid and not the most “wearable” shades, but overall it’s worth the price in my opinion. The exclusives I’ve seen in past boxes are always cool (and end up reselling for ridiculous price points). Regardless, I’m sure this round of boxes will be great."
245,2020-02-05 21:26:38,ex3e9l,"I agree on that, the repeat with the mini breakers is honestly kind of ridiculous at this point since they’ve been in at least one other mystery box release, I thought I heard they were in the summer ones as well but I could be wrong. Same thing with the hat, kinda shady to mark it as an exclusive when essentially, it’s almost the same. 

The 3 exclusives (1 cosmetic, 2 non) were the VLL, t-shirt, and hat. 

But with the mystery boxes, it’s a way to clear stock and include a few “hot ticket” items so they’ll sell and a lot of of those non-exclusive items aren’t always exact to the theme. For Halloween it’s easy to put it the poorly selling greens and vibrant shades and it seemingly makes sense and “passes the theme.” But take the Holiday ‘19 box for example; blue blood wasn’t a bestseller but since it’s blue, people think winter so it goes with the theme. But some of the VLL and skin frost shades (like a hot coral from the summer collection and an extremely dark gold highlighter) have nothing to do with the theme, they just didn’t sell as well. It’s always a risk buying them and not knowing what’s inside and the hype for this round was up more compared to previous boxes, but everyone forgets to realize the theme isn’t for the entire box, just primarily the exclusives."
246,2020-02-05 21:43:16,ex3e9l,"I did see where a lot of people said the mini breaker was in atleast 3 other mystery boxes. I bought it on it's own with the actual Jawbreaker pallet when the combo was put on sale. I, myself love the pallet. I did order the Christmas box that had the BlueBlood pallet. It wasn't something that I would have picked out myself but I do use it. It was the first time I ordered a box. I wasn't thrilled with that dark highlighter and I'm not a fan of red lippies. 

I feel like if you're gonna do an exclusive then there needs to be a true exclusive in the boxes like he did with that highlighter pallet from the Christmas boxes."
247,2020-02-01 07:20:49,ex0q1w,that’s actually pretty fucking cool haha
248,2020-02-01 19:09:33,ex0q1w,Seeing Long Furbies leaving Tumblr and becoming slightly mainstream is like a fever dream.
249,2020-02-03 15:18:40,ex0q1w,Thank you so very much for sharing my art!!! It means a lot ❤️😀
250,2020-02-01 06:04:50,ex0q1w,nice that he's actually supporting an artist after asking musicians to use their music in his series for free- I mean exposure.
251,2020-02-01 05:35:22,ex0q1w,Lol wtf
252,2020-02-01 05:46:02,ex0q1w,"So this is what happens when someone has more money than they know what to do with, lol. Then I'm over here debating with myself over which new Ikea desk chair to get, lol (since my previous one from Ikea broke, after 3 years of daily use, lol) the new one is only $60, definitely going to get it but even that price is high for me, lol."
253,2020-02-03 15:20:10,ex0q1w,It really is awesome! Congratulations!  Did both Jeffree and Shane buy one or just Shane
254,2020-02-01 12:42:48,ex0q1w,I need to know more about this.
255,2020-02-01 13:34:25,ex0q1w,He did that? Oh no. How did you hear about that?
256,2020-02-01 14:05:41,ex0q1w,"The artist probably took a lot of time into making that, even if it's a furby modification, that's a form of art.
I think it's very cool that he payed this much, that's a lot of support for an artist.

Sorry for bad English"
257,2020-02-01 19:44:20,ex0q1w,A lot of celebrities would’ve tried to get it for free so I feel like you can’t be mad at him for actually paying the artist.
258,2020-02-05 02:25:23,ex0q1w,Jeffree said he was going to buy it then Shane snatched it up. Its unclear to me if Shane got it for Jeffree or himself. Neither one has personally spoke to me. The box arrived to Shane yesterday but Jeffree just got back from Miami today so maybe I'll hear something soon!
259,2020-02-01 13:56:46,ex0q1w,"damn I forgot about that, I always try n tell myself that it’s just Shane being naive but like really?? he’s not a dumb dude he knows what he’s doing. It’s a shame tho."
260,2020-02-01 20:25:35,ex0q1w,"Didn't mean it towards the artist who made it, meant it towards Shane who has over $450 to spend on a custom Furby, lol. Nothing against the artist, just more talking about how disconnected Shane has become since he became truly rich. Like many of us are out here just surviving and Shane has more money than he knows what to do with (which we know is true once you calculate what his cut was of the makeup and merch sales, and how much each thing was selling for) so he buys a nearly $500 Furby. Love Shane but he's out of touch with normal people spending."
261,2020-02-01 20:28:14,ex0q1w,"not mad at him for paying the artist, but it's a clear sign that he has way more money than he really knows what to do with, lol. Nothing wrong with that but it's a Furby, the one toy from the 90s that we all tried to destroy cause it was so annoying and no one could seem to get it to shut up for the night."
262,2020-02-01 16:44:59,ex0q1w,It was slightly different than this. Some artists wanted to make music and he accepted. There was some payment form after.
263,2020-02-01 22:45:22,ex0q1w,"Maybe, but he’s supporting someone who definitely has less money than him. Would it have been different if he had seen some online fanart he really liked and then decided to donate $450 to the artist’s patreon? We all know he’s got money, and there’s no need for him to pretend otherwise (although he likes to sometimes), spending his money this way is actually pretty cool."
264,2020-02-01 17:32:07,ex0q1w,ah yeah that’s what I thought? makes more sense

270,2020-01-31 19:53:10,ewtnru,I think I would just hold onto it until something speaks to me. When you see something worth spending it on you'll know. I definitely wouldn't seek out things to splurge on if nothing immediately comes to mind.
271,2020-01-31 20:03:18,ewtnru,In late February there is gunna be another release. Save it for that
272,2020-01-31 20:07:36,ewtnru,"Definitly wait until something speaks to you like the other comment says.  

However, I'll still suggest some stuff.  

I adore the new Natasha Denona Love palette ($65)  

I adore the colorstory, every color belongs there, the shades are great, and the quality is there.  There's pinholes in the back for easy depotting.  I really like this palette.  I suggest looking at YouTube at the palette because the colors are a bit brighter/lighter in real life vs the photos Natasha Denona has up.  

I also highly suggest, if you want a box.  Roll the dice and see if you get a future trendmood box :) it is not a subscription, it's a first come first serve box.  I call it an ""advertisement box"" because it's a very limited amount for a discounted price and it's really just for companies to get some advertisement/hype for their new items.  (That's why there isn't a big stock of it).  They will fully spoil the items before launching, so far there is not a date for it yet, but it will be coming next month I'm sure.  (Price varies for it, so far we've seen a box for $39 and one for $54)."
273,2020-01-31 20:24:14,ewtnru,"Thanks ladies. I may just look into getting a palette or something and put the rest up for later use. There's also this gorgeous nail dipping powder that I just happened to think of that I want, but those aren't expensive."

275,2020-01-31 20:31:13,ewtnru,"Viseart is coming out with a valentines palette as well, and I read it's $39 on Beautylish (on sale I think)? It's cooler toned than the Love palette and it's really pretty. I have the ND love in my Sephora cart, but I wish she'd come out with a cool toned palette already. If I get anything, I think I'm going to get the Love because for me, I prefer the ND formula, but I am tempted by the Viseart. I just find the Viseart formula to be a little more finicky on my skin. It doesn't seem to play well with the primers I have or maybe it's my dry skin yet somehow really watery eyes."
276,2020-01-31 21:21:09,ewtnru,"I think I'm going to cave on that Viseart palette, I've been kicking the idea around all day. I sold several things from my stash in the last couple weeks, so I can get it and still not cheat on the budget I set for myself for the New Year. I hesitate because I seriously don't need more palettes, but I honestly don't have a good cool- toned one like the Viseart, so...😖

ETA: I saw a review on the ND Love palette that claimed the formulas were inconsistent and that it's not one of her better palettes, just an FYI for anyone interested..."
277,2020-01-31 21:56:32,ewtnru,"> ETA: I saw a review on the ND Love palette that claimed the formulas were inconsistent and that it's not one of her better palettes, just an FYI for anyone interested...

Bahhhh I had myself almost convinced to get it."
278,2020-01-31 21:51:04,ewtnru,"I used the tryst palette this am with a new primer and I have to say, I’m going to pass. It didn’t work any better for me than my old primer which is a bit disappointing because I used pmg yesterday with the new one and both pmg and nd don’t seem to be so primer dependent. FWIW I have a couple of the 6 Pan viseart an I like those a bit better but i think I really need to stick with formulas I feel like aren’t a struggle for me. 

I have colourpop fame and honestly that palette is awesome and even better was less than 20 bucks. I’m eyeing their valentines collection because I love fame so much, but seriously I would straight up immediately buy it if either ND or PMG made a cool toned palette. Is that asking for too much really? I like colourpop a lot, and for the price it’s killer, but Nd and pmg are better and worth it, imo."
279,2020-01-31 22:04:44,ewtnru,The review was by Jena Froese on YT. I'm watching a Michele Wang review on it as we speak...
280,2020-01-31 22:03:48,ewtnru,"I haven't tried Viseart yet, so I've been waiting for a color story that speaks to me in a smaller palette to dip my toes in and these soft cool tones are calling my name, lol. I do tend to prefer creamier formulas though, so it's something to consider...

 I guess I'm kinda biased against ND eye palettes 😬 because the 2 I've had did not impress me at all and I de-stashed them, plus she gets criticized pretty often for switching up her formulas constantly and a lack of consistency from one palette to another. I adore the look of the Love palette, but I've just decided for the prices ND charges, I'm gonna need to see more consistency in formulas across palettes before I'd buy from her again."
281,2020-01-31 22:28:41,ewtnru,"Totally fair. The ones I have are great but I have yet to pull the trigger on the love one. I’ll check out the reviews thanks. 

Viseart is well loved. I honestly think it’s me. After using pat McGrath for a couple of days, then struggling with my tryst palette today, it’s clear I shouldn’t bother with this one even though I agree the color story is great. I’m thinking about destashing the tryst now."
282,2020-01-31 19:10:32,ewt780,Girl what is it like to be your bank account lol!!! Glad you got everything! This was my first time buying. I got the big box and the fuzzy sweater. Thinking I should of got the bag and mirror ugh haha
283,2020-01-31 19:08:30,ewt780,"The grinder!!!!😍😍 Hell yeah. I literally JUST spent 50 bucks on a cute new custom grinder from Etsy, so I couldn’t justify getting his grinder as well. A little sad tho cuz the only reason I ordered the one on Etsy is cuz all of Jeffrees grinders were sold out 😂"

286,2020-01-31 19:30:48,ewt780,This launch was soo smooth and easy :) was so happy that shit dint break while panic clicking everything.
287,2020-01-31 22:07:54,ewt780,"I'm so annoyed. I got the Med box. And later I saw the small one was still available. Husband gave me the ok to spend $100. I procrastinated and the box is now gone. I'm so mad at myself! I would've had 2 boxes AND a mirror and scrub. If you want something, ORDER IT NOW."

291,2020-02-02 01:22:29,ewt780,"Right! My laptop had NO PROBLEMS hardly at all. But my cell phone wasn't working with the drop down buttons. So alot of ppl who tried buying from their cell phones had problems. But my 1st order went right through, and my 2nd order only took like 15mins wait time. So all in all, hella smooth this time. Lol. :)"
292,2020-02-02 01:19:48,ewt780,"I did that with the last Mystery boxes. And didn't get the smallest box. Then was like, ok I'll get it too. And it was gone.. so I TOTALLY know how you feel!!!! Xoxoxox"
293,2020-02-02 01:18:13,ewt780,Right! The kief screen and catcher is great!!! And the little Star Scraper it comes with is amazing imo! Lol.

358,2020-01-31 17:26:40,ewh6lo,What kind of boxes or pouches do you use for that? That’s a good idea!
359,2020-01-31 17:27:42,ewh6lo,I use padded envelopes and bubble wrap for most packages. Some end up in boxes if they’re too heavy for First Class though.

My Name is Melissa and the last few Mystery Boxes had some content I personally wouldn’t wear and first I thought... I should keep it for my collection but then thinking about it just going to waste made me sad. I made a little mystery box of a few items that I have never worn!
If you are interested please message me of follow me on instagram janmelmoore and talk to me :)
I am from Europe and would love to make someone happy who didn’t get anything so far.

The mystery boy contains:
4 Liquid Lip (1 of them is an exclusive)
4 Glosses
1 Skin Frost (its an exclusive) ;)
1 Popsocket
1 Bag

I am selling this box for 140 Euros plus shipping. If you live in the EU I will cover shipping!! :))

I can also take some sneak peak pictures.
I just want to keep the mystery alive for anyone who hasn’t experienced it yet. If you are still interested without the mystery fact I can send pics of the items :)"

729,2020-02-10 20:58:34,ew635c,"I got my premium box, I only want the gloss. Box was damaged either by shipping or by my incompetence, I can't remember if the box looked like this before I opened it.

I ultimately want to trade the unwanted items (Beanie, popsocket, and Alien palette) for other JSC items, preferably makeup. So other lip products or palettes, but I lean more towards lip products. I'd also prefer to trade for other mystery box items, like exclusives, but am open to just general product.

If no one wants to trade, I'd move to selling the three items. But selling isn't my end goal, because I spent the money for makeup in mystery boxes and that is what I want. If it comes to selling, I'd honestly be more likely to keep Alien, and then sell just the beanie and popsocket, preferably together."

1813,2020-02-09 00:11:36,ew635c,"shipping is looking to be about 20-50 (CND) depending on how fast you want it shipped, so i would imagine it would be the same both ways. i just did a basic small package, 3kg weight, at a small box 20x20x5 cm box, im not exactly sure how big a box would need to be to be a good fit with proper stuffing lol

my package has just left Vancouver (for some reason) and still has to come to Ontario, so im guessing by Tuesday, but by Friday the latest"

1829,2020-01-31 16:09:29,ew635c,"that's a good point, didn't think about that. I guess its usage has just become normalized to me."

1879,2020-02-08 03:16:12,ew635c,"I have those VLL already unfortunately, but, what would you want to trade the bag for?"
1880,2020-02-08 02:12:38,ew635c,So that would be $65 plus shipping which I would guess is about $10? I shipped to Oregon once from TX and that was $14 so I’m guessing 😅
1881,2020-02-08 02:44:38,ew635c,Right now it’s claimed!

1889,2020-02-08 06:06:13,ew635c,Do you have photos of the LE VLL you have? Is that the one that’s similar to the Christmas mystery shade? And price for the white mirror?
1890,2020-02-11 01:46:28,ew635c,"Is succulent the exclusive gloss? If so, are you willing to sell that?"

1939,2020-02-19 14:32:10,ew635c,"Hiya rosie,  I initially paid $68 to get it to to me with the shipping and taxes.  So, that’d probably be the start + add on shipping."

2022,2020-02-07 11:31:33,ew635c,If you end up with a platinum ice palette I'd definitely be interested in that (sadly the 24 Karat is just too warm toned for me).  Also happy to swap lipsticks/glosses/liquid lip if we end up preferring each other's shades.  I know I'll need to swap/sell the ice cold as it's too glittery for me to get much use out of.
2023,2020-02-07 18:12:33,ew635c,Fab.  I'll let you know as soon as it arrives and we'll sort something out.  Are you interested in anything in particular from the supreme?

2175,2020-02-22 04:10:15,ew635c,"I’d love to pay retail + shipping but I understand and would be willing to pay if you’re looking for a few dollars above, because it’s sold out everywhere!"
2176,2020-02-27 02:22:33,ew635c,"If everyone before hasn't taken the offer, I'm ISO it too :)"
2177,2020-02-24 23:14:29,ew635c,"If they haven’t taken you up on the gloss, I’d be willing to pay for it as well!!"
2178,2020-02-23 18:04:49,ew635c,How much for it and international shipping in USD? I gotta check conversion rates coz they’re trash atm

2189,2020-02-06 22:32:39,ew635c,I have a hat if you’re looking to buy :)
2190,2020-02-07 00:42:45,ew635c,i don’t know how to do that.
2191,2020-02-10 10:19:05,ew635c,I’ll pm you.
2192,2020-02-23 18:57:43,ew635c,I’ll give u all three for 20
2193,2020-02-25 05:04:03,ew635c,Lol. The highlighter is really bugging me. I've had it since Christmas as well.  It's such a good product I just want to find it a home.
2194,2020-02-07 18:13:34,ew635c,"the VLL has been claimed by someone already, i'll let you know if it falls through. i could do $40 shipped for the gloss and the hat though:)"
2195,2020-02-11 11:49:03,ew635c,"I have the dad hat and the green straws. I'd be willing to bundle them for $35! That includes shipping. If OP doesn't respond. :)
https://imgur.com/gallery/jGma2Ri"
2196,2020-02-07 12:04:54,ew635c,"$18, that's the price on the website"
2197,2020-02-10 23:17:03,ew635c,"Hi, if buying both I am willing to sell the gloss for $40 and the hat for $15 so $55 total for products and shipping -- can agree on $65 total if within the US"
2198,2020-02-10 23:28:45,ew635c,[removed]
2199,2020-02-11 04:24:25,ew635c,Absolutely; would 100 plus the costs of shipping work for all three?
2200,2020-02-02 21:00:20,ew635c,Wow....wish I could say I’m surprised
2201,2020-02-08 20:28:19,ew635c,I’m looking to sell the beanie and pop socket from the deluxe box. Are you interested?
2202,2020-02-10 09:24:33,ew635c,"Hi! Are you still selling the Blue Blood? If so, how much?"
2203,2020-02-07 15:57:46,ew635c,"Thank you, that is truly appreciated aha!"
2204,2020-02-07 17:51:55,ew635c,Oh wow! Well your mistake benefits us at least 😂 It's a great box so I don't think you'll have any trouble recouping what you paid! I can also PayPal you once you get your boxes in. I'm getting the Supreme box so I might have the green or white VLL if you want to go the swap route instead of selling
2205,2020-02-12 04:54:43,ew635c,"sorry, i dont:("
2206,2020-02-17 17:09:45,ew635c,Yes PM me!
2207,2020-02-01 02:32:15,ew635c,"Sure! I took multiple photos. Mine came from the Christmas mystery box.

2209,2020-02-08 05:15:13,ew635c,"I can totally wait until then! I haven’t used it at all, opened the box, looked at the bullet, then immediately put it back in the box because I knew I’d never use it. So it hasn’t been swatched or touched in any way. I also have Candy Freeze in the same condition (unswatched, new in box) if you’d be interested in trading for that one. I just prefer the VLL formula compared to the lip ammos. Let me know!"
2210,2020-02-07 22:05:54,ew635c,Oooh okay. I was gonna say!! I’m glad I ordered one! It will be here tomorrow!
2211,2020-02-04 04:25:53,ew635c,That’s awesome! I would love to have first dibs! ♥️

2213,2020-02-28 23:39:30,ew635c,That is awesome! I would like to purchase it from you - how do we get this process rolling?
2214,2020-02-08 03:04:22,ew635c,"We can just do a PayPal backed sale. I would ask for full retail plus shipping and fees so I don’t lose money.  It will not charge you a crazy price like you would find on eBay or Poshmark. I am not looking to profit, only make my money back."
2215,2020-02-08 23:18:38,ew635c,"Oh my box comes in Monday btw. But if you do want to trade, I can ship Tuesday morning."
2216,2020-02-09 21:25:37,ew635c,Interested in the maroon side bag! I sent a PM
2217,2020-02-14 01:45:54,ew635c,i can do that please pm me!!

2221,2020-02-06 06:53:28,ew635c,"Yay! It looks like it’s going by sizes again and all the small sizes I’ve seen have 24k so, I’ll let you know! :) I just want a lighter colored highlighter palette because I’m sooo pale."

2223,2020-02-06 09:12:32,ew635c,Will do! Haven't received shipping confirmation yet and live on the east coast 😒 so don't think I ghosted if it takes a little while
2224,2020-02-28 18:48:24,ew635c,"I'm sorry I ended up deciding to keep the alien palette, but I wish you the best of luck in your search 😊"
2225,2020-02-06 17:20:14,ew635c,Okay I'm going to message you!
2226,2020-02-07 01:12:07,ew635c,That sounds so amazing! Suddenly I need new lipstick(s) for a coffee cozy or beanie 🥺😂
2227,2020-02-07 01:13:11,ew635c,I’m sorry - you must include in the image verification of your username on a piece of paper too.

2233,2020-02-08 15:20:20,ew635c,Sweet I’ll take it. PayPal ok?
2234,2020-02-12 04:51:45,ew635c,I'm thinking $18 plus shipping. I'm guessing shipping will most likely be around $4-5.
2235,2020-02-25 06:07:38,ew635c,I’m definitely willing and ready to buy if they don’t want it :)
2236,2020-02-07 17:52:23,ew635c,"I'm sorry love, it's sold"

2392,2020-02-11 06:36:33,ew635c,i removed your comment. this is your one and only warning...price gouging is not allowed in this sub and you are asking $50 for a lip gloss.  thank you!
2393,2020-02-11 04:25:43,ew635c,Messaged you
2394,2020-02-08 20:32:42,ew635c,Unfortunately I found someone to sell me the beanie already. Thank you for asking though! I’m sure you’ll be able to sell it :)
2395,2020-02-10 14:54:30,ew635c,Hey there! Selling for $45 plus shipping. Can send pics if you’re interested! Just PM me :)
2396,2020-02-12 20:31:49,ew635c,Hi! Not trying to be rude and jump in on your thread here but I got a pink pop socket in my premium box and would be willing to sell if it doesn’t work out between you two. Let me know! I’m also not trying to price gouge... I just have no use for it and would like to get something for it. Open to any reasonable offers.
2397,2020-02-08 05:08:15,ew635c,Are you in the US? If you are PM me!
2398,2020-02-08 05:21:38,ew635c,Oh awesome! I would love both if possible. I really hope I get some VLLs you are interested in! I really like the lip ammos but it seems they are not as popular in the mystery boxes and that is how I get most of my JSC items.
2399,2020-02-04 05:59:23,ew635c,i'll message back here as soon as they come and let you know!!!! you got first dibs fo sho 💛

2403,2020-02-10 16:43:35,ew635c,I’d happily trade the mirror for the beanie and pop socket. Would you like to message me for details?
2404,2020-02-14 01:40:25,ew635c,Tracked or untracked?
2405,2020-02-07 07:12:26,ew635c,Okay! I got my tracking # but it still says pre-shipment so I have no clue when I will get my boxes.
2406,2020-02-06 09:15:18,ew635c,Totally understand! Thank you again!

2418,2020-02-05 04:18:37,ew635c,You're welcome😊
2419,2020-02-07 00:38:04,ew635c,"I haven’t received my boxes yet (premium and deluxe), but I think I’d rather just purchase separately than trade, as I don’t own Alien as of now. But thank you for the offer!"
2420,2020-02-06 20:04:08,ew635c,I’d be willing to buy the gloss from you! For retail + Shipping??

2424,2020-02-08 02:00:24,ew635c,"Well, once you get your box I’m open to see if you’d like to trade something from there!"
2425,2020-02-08 02:46:45,ew635c,Gotcha girl!
2426,2020-02-08 15:46:02,ew635c,"I’ll do all of it including the 24k for $50 plus shipping? Adding up just the gloss, VLL and cap is $45 anyway!"
2427,2020-02-08 15:16:48,ew635c,Which were you interested in?
2428,2020-02-08 06:15:39,ew635c,That lip shade is very very similar to the Christmas mystery shade so it wouldn’t be a valued addition to my collection. Once I find out the result of a couple other trades I’m working with I’ll let you know about the mirror. Do you know what your shipping would be to East Florida? I can privately give you a zip code 😘
2429,2020-02-10 02:33:28,ew635c,Oh awesome! You’ve got a deal! Chat me we can exchange info :)

2461,2020-02-10 21:29:08,ew635c,"Good to know! I'll check back up with you in a few days, my box has arrived to the border so shouldn't take long 😁"
2462,2020-02-11 07:35:02,ew635c,Would you be able to tell me how much shipping would be? Zip code is 27615
2463,2020-02-11 23:27:43,ew635c,I’d be interesting in soft serve and 818 (maybe baby daddy too I wanna look up swatches first). When you find out if you have more let me know! How much were you thinking for them?
2464,2020-02-11 00:43:41,ew635c,Im thinking 18 plus shipping but have been dmed some Inquiries
2465,2020-02-11 05:19:32,ew635c,I sent you a pm!
2466,2020-02-11 19:22:27,ew635c,Not sure why but PM feature isnt working! Does 20$ plus cost of shipping work?
2467,2020-02-12 03:18:45,ew635c,Definitely interested! I’ll PM you my zip ☺️
2468,2020-02-11 23:32:05,ew635c,Could you do $30 + shipping?
2469,2020-02-11 23:59:31,ew635c,"$70 is a bit under the cost I paid for both, but I'm willing to do $75 plus shipping."
2470,2020-02-13 20:44:22,ew635c,Thanks for the offer but i am not interested anymore. Best of luck in selling!
2471,2020-02-12 04:48:55,ew635c,If it’s not sold by Friday I’ll take it :)
2472,2020-02-12 04:57:26,ew635c,Frozen peach sold !

2477,2020-02-27 05:08:22,ew635c,I was able to trade for a VLL shade I've been wanting and is hard to find!
2478,2020-03-03 01:21:18,ew635c,I just PMed you!
2479,2020-01-30 14:54:32,ew635c,Yeah with the price of the straw it might end up being more than I’m looking to pay at the moment :(
2480,2020-01-30 16:17:43,ew635c,Hey girl hey! And omg how unfortunate.
2481,2020-02-05 05:12:54,ew635c,Awesome! Let me know if you decide to trade 😊
2482,2020-02-07 18:26:39,ew635c,would you like me to put a hold on the gloss and hat for you? and i'll let you know if the VLL falls through!
2483,2020-02-11 01:02:39,ew635c,"I just sold mine for 20, keep looking, dont let people do this to ya, they wont sell it, and they will drop the price

Says right in the description no price gouging! more than doubling the price i think falls under that pretty well!"
2484,2020-02-08 05:25:15,ew635c,"I’d really love Romeo if you get that variation, or a pink nude or any red that isn’t Poinsettia. Can’t wait! I work doing therapy and that’s just too much talking to keep a lip ammo on for that long 😂 may odds be ever in your mystery box favor!!"
2485,2020-02-08 23:51:29,ew635c,I would love to buy the glosses!
2486,2020-02-14 01:47:33,ew635c,tracked

2491,2020-02-09 00:00:45,ew635c,Message sent! :)

2501,2020-02-07 14:09:45,ew635c,I’m actually in the US. Do you know if it’s crazy postage?
2502,2020-02-06 22:15:47,ew635c,Coming in mystery box
2503,2020-02-08 20:14:49,ew635c,Awesome! I’m super pale so I wouldn’t get much use out of 24K 😊 Thank you!
2504,2020-02-11 08:07:35,ew635c,I’ll figure it out and PM you when I have a number!
2505,2020-02-12 00:12:08,ew635c,"I was thinking about $12 each plus shipping. I can get an estimate for shipping cost if you send me your zip code. They are pretty light, so I'm pretty sure shipping will be around $4, but I can get an estimate just to be sure."
2506,2020-02-11 00:53:22,ew635c,Totally fair. If someone else beat me to it in your DMs then it’s theirs 😊
2507,2020-02-11 19:41:03,ew635c,Yes! Sounds good!
2508,2020-02-12 00:20:16,ew635c,No. Sorry.
2509,2020-02-12 00:05:43,ew635c,"I would be down for that, pm me with shipping costs and paypal info please!"
2510,2020-02-12 04:53:27,ew635c,Sounds good!
2511,2020-02-14 16:41:01,ew635c,"if you ever change your mind, let me know!"
2512,2020-02-27 05:30:14,ew635c,Oooh!  What shade?  If you don’t mind me asking 👀
2513,2020-02-07 00:09:20,ew635c,"Alright, let’s go for it! I’ll DM you."
2514,2020-02-07 18:27:05,ew635c,Yes please 💖
2515,2020-02-11 01:03:49,ew635c,"I didn't end up putting in an offer, I have already commented on someone else's offer for $20, I knew $50 was too high and it said no price gouging anyway."
2516,2020-02-08 05:27:00,ew635c,It seems like a lot of boxes are getting that so I feel hopeful! Thank you for waiting.
2517,2020-02-08 23:54:00,ew635c,i still have the legends only gloss! succulent has been sold already:(
2518,2020-02-19 03:18:48,ew635c,trade already happened
2519,2020-02-08 15:52:33,ew635c,Perf! I know I sold to you in December but do you mind texting me all your info again! 😇
2520,2020-02-08 16:13:20,ew635c,What are you willing to trade?
2521,2020-02-12 01:07:39,ew635c,"I have softcore sparkle, I'm in Canada!"
2522,2020-02-21 19:25:20,ew635c,It’s sucks so much. I’m just gonna have to buy an overpriced one on poshmark or mercari 🙄
2523,2020-02-01 21:10:06,ew635c,Omg really?? How much? 😭💛
2524,2020-02-05 04:53:16,ew635c,You’re amazing!! Thank you so much!! 😘
2525,2020-02-07 14:40:16,ew635c,You'd be looking at about £15 for both tracked postage wise so not awful! Might be cheaper via courier and not royal mail too
2526,2020-02-07 14:30:55,ew635c,[deleted]
2527,2020-02-11 08:14:00,ew635c,Alright sounds great thanks!
2528,2020-02-12 00:26:52,ew635c,Zip code would be 27615 :)
2529,2020-02-11 19:58:17,ew635c,"OK, no problem. Please PM me and we can work out the details!"
2530,2020-02-12 00:12:45,ew635c,Will do!
2531,2020-02-27 05:37:29,ew635c,Gemini full size not mini
2532,2020-02-07 18:30:46,ew635c,gotcha <3
2533,2020-02-11 04:14:15,ew635c,"I completely agree with the both of you. I never sold his products before, and as I wrote, I went online and thought I was being fair by picking the lowest and basing my price off of what I saw. I realize now that site is not reliable."
2534,2020-02-08 05:37:43,ew635c,"I’ve only seen two boxes come close to my variation, except instead of the lip ammo in Yummy, they got a VLL in Bronze Blood. I feel pretty special so far, just a shame I can’t make it wearable 🙃😅 no worries! Can’t wait to see what you get!"
2535,2020-02-08 15:53:22,ew635c,"Yeah, no worries! 😄"
2536,2020-02-08 16:26:19,ew635c,Anything from the Deluxe if you're interested but the cost of shipping between USA >< EU makes it not really worth it for either of us
2537,2020-02-12 01:18:19,ew635c,"I’m in the US, shipping would probably be too expensive. Thank you for offering, though! I really appreciate it."
2538,2020-02-13 02:43:59,ew635c,I'm in the US and am interested!
2539,2020-02-21 19:25:57,ew635c,Are these resale sites? I've been looking for some of those 🥴
2540,2020-02-01 21:30:27,ew635c,[deleted]
2541,2020-02-12 00:56:47,ew635c,"Thanks! I'll have to weigh them to get an accurate shipping estimate, so I will do that as soon as I get home. I should be home within the hour. Leaving work now."
2542,2020-02-12 02:16:33,ew635c,It looks like it’s about $5 for shipping. So $12 for each VLL plus $5 shipping for the whole thing. Does that work for you?
2543,2020-02-27 05:39:11,ew635c,Yesss that’s such a pretty neutral shade 😍
2544,2020-02-11 06:41:06,ew635c,right on! thanks!!
2545,2020-02-08 20:29:16,ew635c,Can you DM me what specific items you got in the deluxe box?
2546,2020-02-21 19:27:24,ew635c,Gurlllll just be real careful bc some of these people rlly be charging $125 for an extreme frost. Luckily I found someone whose only charging $70 so I’m gonna see if they’ll take $60 instead
2547,2020-02-01 21:32:40,ew635c,Tbh both if you are willing to sell both sizes. 🥺
2548,2020-02-12 13:28:52,ew635c,That works! I think I’ll just take 818 and Soft serve unless you found others :)
2549,2020-02-21 19:27:57,ew635c,Wheeew okay thank you sm! And goodluck! 💕
2550,2020-02-22 01:05:40,ew635c,Just saw one sell for $130 on mercari. 😨
2551,2020-02-12 17:45:25,ew635c,"Sounds good! The only other one I found was Venus Flytrap. I'm in classes all day, so I'll pack it up tonight when I get home and send you a verification photo."
2552,2020-02-21 19:31:24,ew635c,You as well!
2553,2020-02-22 06:17:27,ew635c,I know! People are truly insane. Especially since they’ll be eventually restocked. Luckily I found someone who was charging $75 with free shipping so I ordered that instead
2554,2020-02-12 19:06:05,ew635c,Yeah I got that one so just the two then :) sounds good thank you!
2555,2020-02-13 14:38:37,ew635c,"Here is the link to the verification photos: https://imgur.com/gallery/py6bnav

If you pm me your PayPal info, I can send you an invoice and get a shipping label printed."
2556,2020-01-30 10:53:25,ew3huu,Now that you’ve said it I can’t unsee it
2557,2020-01-30 17:26:31,ew3huu,WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
2558,2020-01-31 02:58:22,ew3huu,LMAO OMG
2559,2020-02-03 06:04:10,ew3huu,What the!!! LOL I can (slightly) see it.
2560,2020-01-30 21:27:59,ew3huu,"I can’t see it, can someone link a picture?"
2561,2020-01-30 05:53:08,evzmfg,"Can you review their products on their website? If so, mention this, since it will force the company to think about their reputation and alert potential customers to their customer service problem. Hopefully the company will learn to be better at it."
2562,2020-01-30 09:18:04,evzmfg,"Wow, that's terrible! I follow them on Instagram too as their products are such beautiful colours. I've always wanted to buy some eyeshadow but now I'll think twice."
2563,2020-01-30 12:57:14,evzmfg,"Post this on makeup addiction too. This company cant delete reddit posts. and you can on their instagram say, ""hey! So you guys don't have a review section! Sketch. I took the liberty of reviewing you on reddit with all the proof from our interaction."" Then maybe they'll be nicer."
2564,2020-01-30 06:24:44,evzmfg,Sounds like quite the chaotic experience
2565,2020-01-30 14:04:00,evzmfg,"I used to love Chaos. I've ordered from them a few times and always loved what I got and had no complaints about the customer service. But then stories like this started popping up everywhere and now I never wanna buy from them again. Every purchase, so far, has been fine but I know a catastrophe is waiting to happen if I keep buying from them.

They have good products too. It's a shame they're ruining their own business with shitty customer service."
2566,2020-01-30 12:38:24,evzmfg,hope your gf still enjoyed the products! good of you to think about her interests and gift her that :)
2567,2020-01-30 14:01:47,evzmfg,"I absolutely love when people post this stuff. I live in the US, and am admittedly, very bad with tracking my expenses. I would just chalk this up to a loss if it happened to me - and quietly swear not to order from them again... knowing I can avoid them without the first hand disappoint is so helpful. I’m sorry for you and your girlfriends experience"
2568,2020-01-30 14:53:53,evzmfg,"Agreed. I've placed 2 orders. Customer service is Terrible. I've had each message I send ignored. I live in the US took over a month to get a shipping confirmation each. Do not recommend this company... 

If your looking into really unique indie brands and better Customer service, I highly recommend clionadh cosmetics (shipping times are also length though, but the products are a 100x worth it), devinah cosmetics, and terra moons cosmetics."
2569,2020-01-30 15:28:19,evzmfg,I've never heard of this brand. Really sucks because their stuff looks amazing. Thanks for the heads up. The Beauty News video was crazy lol. The owner sounds unstable lol.
2570,2020-01-30 15:55:11,evzmfg,"I'm in the US and my husband had the same experience last year.  He ordered me one full sized eyeshadow and a trio sample pack and it took over three months to arrive.    Like in the us TX to IA shopping is normally a week or so.  I understand all the products are handmade in Texas and it takes time but I don't feel like the company does much to manage customer expectations.  Like if they posted on their site something about ""production is currently 3 weeks out for orders"" or something it would improve the experience 100%.  And that they totally ghosted my husband when he followed up multiple times is unacceptable."
2571,2020-01-30 16:21:20,evzmfg,Sounds like Storybook Cosmetics. What an absolute clusterfuck of a company.
2572,2020-01-30 16:28:35,evzmfg,They live up to their name
2573,2020-01-31 04:45:23,evzmfg,"Omggg they're such a horrible brand!!! No one should ever order from them. You're not the first it's happened to and definitely won't be the last. 

There are soooo many brands out there now. If it matters to yall I'll happily give you a few brands to look into that have similar products,  especially if you're looking at the multichromes!! I have been an influencer for 3 years, been taking a break for the past 6+ months (mental illness issues, getting medicated soon!!!). I'm small and dont use ig anymore, more twitter/fb and here. But anyway, bc of me wanting to be an influencer I've been mentally taking notes on who not to buy from and who to buy from. I should probably make an actual list with receipts butttt 🤷🏼‍♀️🤣 

Please, please do your research on brands, especially on twitter if you can ( just type in brand name and look at all tweets). There are sooo many scams/horrible business owners out there now."
2574,2020-01-30 05:57:46,evzmfg,"I just double checked and they don't seem to have a review section under the products on their site. When commenting on their Instagram posts about my problem, they would always delete it within minutes, so I don't think transparency with their customers is a big priority for them unfortunately."
2575,2020-01-30 09:32:57,evzmfg,"It's a real shame! My SO does like the products, but there are so many brands out there, and we both can't stand bad customer service! Particularly when you're only request is to receive the items you have purchased."
2576,2020-01-30 15:50:04,evzmfg,"oh ho ho YES. also, go on Twitter, @ them in a thread about your experience. they can't delete that either."
2577,2020-01-30 12:53:58,evzmfg,"She definitely did/ will! Haha thanks, a lot of these beauty YouTubers are actually pretty entertaining, so I'm learning way more about this stuff than I ever thought I would!"
2578,2020-04-26 21:34:54,evzmfg,The same exact thing happened to me. I’m sorry that occurred. :(
2579,2020-01-30 10:31:30,evzmfg,The way customers are treated over something like this is a huuuge thing I take into consideration. It's unfortunate for sure.
2580,2020-01-30 12:09:13,evzmfg,"Just went for a look to see if anyone else had had problems with their customer service and found this from Beauty News.. [**https://youtu.be/Jvv1k8h2z5c**](https://youtu.be/Jvv1k8h2z5c)  This is from over a year ago too, so it's obviously a problem they have no intention of fixing."

He's not racist, he was just taken the wrong way."
2592,2020-02-08 00:20:37,evz3gn,Just because he pumps out for products to make money on from different people does not discount his racism.

2598,2020-01-30 07:05:57,evycij,U rich now? Quit your job and openend a full time lenghtening workshop?
2599,2020-01-30 03:12:44,evycij,You are doing gods work
2600,2020-01-30 04:50:10,evycij,Wow that’s absolutely amazing. I love both of them and I think this long furby will definitely make a video appearance.
2601,2020-01-30 13:27:37,evycij,Omg I’m so excited for you!!! It finally made it to him!! I did try but I’m not famous enough for my tweet to be read by a celebrity lol
2602,2020-01-30 05:25:19,evycij,"Niiiiiiiiiice, good for you OP! :D"
2603,2020-01-30 15:44:49,evycij,I don’t like either of them but if they featured your work in a video that would be huge for you!
2604,2020-01-30 14:04:06,evycij,How often do you guys sell these things? Is there like an actual market for them?
2605,2020-01-30 14:25:54,evycij,Oh shidd good for you! That must’ve felt so great :)
2606,2020-02-08 05:38:39,evycij,"Wow, this is so well-made to the tats and the hands. Now, I want one and carry it around like a scarf."

Congrats x"
2610,2020-01-30 13:27:39,evycij,Thank you 😀
2611,2020-01-30 03:21:07,evycij,"Also WOW I got a simple private message from my fav youtuber recently and I felt famous, I bet you are over the moon."
2612,2020-01-30 13:28:16,evycij,I will thank you ❤️
2613,2020-01-30 13:30:27,evycij,450 but after that palette release he's probably okay. Lol. This was a godsend for the starving artist. 😀 I kept worrying it would sit unsold. All that tine and money into it.
2614,2020-01-30 12:53:26,evycij,$450
2615,2020-01-30 13:32:02,evycij,Lmao. Don't I wish!
2616,2020-01-30 13:27:55,evycij,Lol. Hilarious.
2617,2020-01-30 13:31:42,evycij,"Wouldn't that be funny. I'm sure it will be in the video pan when Shane says ""more people judging me"" and its all his stuffed animals creatures."
2618,2020-01-30 13:42:54,evycij,Thanks for trying. So many lovely people did. I was so happy to see the support. Jeffree and Shane probably get so bombarded each day that it would be hard to get noticed. But the right person got through!!!!! I'm grateful to everyone!
2619,2020-01-30 13:32:11,evycij,Thank you 😀

2625,2020-01-30 13:40:18,evycij,Are you the same person who commented on my insta? I'm thinking so. No racists here. Just to clarify for the second time.
2626,2020-01-30 13:27:23,evycij,"Yes, super excited! It doesn't change a ton for daily life and you still gotta work just as hard but to have that fun appreciation is beyond fabulous!"
2627,2020-01-30 19:44:38,evycij,Don’t forget to include a love note for Shane from the Furb community! Lol
2628,2020-02-01 18:56:53,evycij,Noooo I love your furbies
2629,2020-02-14 09:30:46,evycij,"I’m probably gonna learn by myself how to make one of these. If I was richer, I would’ve bought one made from you originally. Thank you for the inspiration."
2630,2020-01-30 17:03:27,evycij,Nope
2631,2020-02-01 18:16:17,evycij,For sure! I mentioned the community to the Insider reporter for my interview as well. I can't remember if she added that. It's all an exciting blur.
2632,2020-02-02 19:54:22,evycij,Lol. I hoped so.
2633,2020-02-02 18:57:34,evycij,You had an interview?
2634,2020-02-02 19:54:43,evycij,Yes. Insider did one!!!!

2638,2020-01-30 06:05:15,evxcz9,And a me approved Star

2642,2020-01-30 01:08:33,evwqej,It does and the little shovel is so cute! I envy you that you got the pink one haha. The green is starting to grow on me though.

2648,2020-03-28 01:26:51,fq9uj7,"If there isn't a sale at ELF I wouldn't say it's worth it since you can buy most of them at Walmart. Old Navy sells some ELF stuff so even with their current 30% off it's still better. Tarte is 30% off if you sign up for their membership. I don't believe Too Faced has a Canadian warehouse so it's $12 shipping to Canada. Bite Beauty has free shipping above $35USD and they charge USD.

Vichy has up 25% off and free shipping on all orders. Lancome has 3 different GWP (min $75 purchase). The Bay has a lot of haircare (Devacurl, American Curl, Paul Mitchell, Color Wow, It's a 10, etc) on sale."
2649,2020-03-28 03:00:24,fq9uj7,"Don’t forgoet 15% off at The Bay, no matter how you pay, I know normally to get 15 % off you have to use their credit card but it’s the Friend and Family sale so 15 % off no matter how you pay, yes make up and skincare are included.  They had some nice sale for Nuxe stuff like 30% off and it stacked with the 15% off site wide deal, but I don’t think Nuxe is on sale anymore.

If you’re into Korean skincare and make up then jolse.com is having major sales 20% off site wide, then there’s up to 50% off brands like Dr. Jart, Huxley, Blithe, Cosrx, innisfree, etc free ship at any amount.

Edit:  Charlotte Tilbury is 20% off site wide, 4% cash back on Rakuten. 

Edit:  sorry for Charlotte Tilbury it’s only the kits that are 20% off, I can’t read lol. 

Edit again:  sorry just remembered another one, Easter egg beauty box from Lookfantasic worth $419USD items include:

Rodial Vit C Glow Tonic (200ml) – worth $55USD

Balance Me Radiance Face Oil (30ml) – worth $40USD

Dr.Jart+ Cicapair Tiger Grass Color Correcting Treatment (50ml) – worth $52USD

Elemis Pro-Collagen Advanced Eye Treatment (15ml) – worth $68USD

Christophe Robin Cleansing Volumising Paste with Pure Rassoul Clay and Rose Extracts (250ml) – worth $53USD

Omorovicza Deep Cleansing Mask (50ml) – worth $120USD

Aveda Damage Remedy Daily Hair Repair (100ml) – worth $31USD

It’s $113CAD, with the Rakuten code:  BBSUBSEGG10, it’s $100CAD.  The egg is on pre order so it’ll ship out soon I hope or early April for Easter, it’s free shipping of course.  Here’s the site:

https://us.lookfantastic.com/beauty-box/lookfantastic-the-beauty-egg-collection-2020-worth-419/11639221.html

Edit again:  jolse.com doesn’t have free shipping for Canadians, I have no idea why I was able to get free shipping from them.  If you would like free shipping from a K beauty site then akoco.com is also having a sale right now up to 50% off laneige items and others, free shipping at $50USD."
2650,2020-03-28 01:29:05,fq9uj7,"Ulta has their 21 days of beauty going on and still has free shipping over 75$ CAD. I got acouple ofra highlighters for half off last week! Gonna be ordering again tomorrow! Also they have sales like buy one get one 40% and just a lot of good sales. Their shipping to Canada is pretty fast too. Takes around 1 week to arrive

Also there are duties but you can pay them when you check out on the website. For both the orders I’ve made which have been around 80$ the duties were 11-15$"
2651,2020-03-28 00:47:35,fq9uj7,I believe shoppers is still free shipping too
2652,2020-03-28 02:09:30,fq9uj7,Urban decay also has free shipping.
2653,2020-03-28 13:14:00,fq9uj7,"The face Shop is also offering free shipping on all orders!

Edit: Also just noticed Holt Renfrew online has free shipping and their sale section has a bunch of Bunch of luxe beauty products on sale. They have a promo code “spring30” but it looks like it doesn’t apply to beauty."
2654,2020-03-28 15:34:30,fq9uj7,Don't forget Rakuten!
2655,2020-03-28 01:43:14,fq9uj7,"As tempting as they may sound, i would say avoid unless ofcourse you absolutely can’t. Because there have been news of corona virus cases in amazon’s warehouses too so one can never be so careful."
2656,2020-03-28 02:58:38,fq9uj7,"I really need to get started on buying makeup so can take advantage of all these sales!!

I basically only own a mascara, some lip gloss and some random foundation tube I bought at a warehouse sale"
2657,2020-03-28 16:34:08,fq9uj7,Tarte is 25% for everyone and 30% if you sign up for their rewards. Urban Decay also has free shipping. Sephora also has the same 20% off Bite lipcare products

2663,2020-03-28 02:10:13,fq9uj7,I have so much makeup a!ready..buying more just to wear in my bedroom is just lighting my money on fire..I would rather spend $ on weed...being stoned through all this is probably better for my mental health
2664,2020-03-28 08:01:43,fq9uj7,Jolse doesn't have free ship for us though. Stuck with ems or DHL.
2665,2020-03-28 16:30:34,fq9uj7,[deleted]
2666,2020-03-28 07:23:02,fq9uj7,Yes! I'm waiting for the cover fx blush duos since I don't have enough to purchase on 2 different days. I still wish they decrease their shipping minimum since many other sites do $50 minimum now.
2667,2020-03-28 03:02:18,fq9uj7,No duties or anything?
2668,2020-03-28 01:29:08,fq9uj7,"No i dont believe so, only over 50$, but 75$+ you get 20x the points!"
2669,2020-03-28 17:47:12,fq9uj7,"My email dated today has a black bar at the top which reads ""enjoy free shipping on all orders. No minimum spend"" (this is the get 20X the points on $75 purchase email)"
2670,2020-03-28 12:57:14,fq9uj7,And their naked heat petite is on sale too.

Got a Zara box with 2 pairs of shoes sitting in my garage rn since yesterday 🤣"
2672,2020-03-28 04:07:51,fq9uj7,Beautylish has a handful on sale and they have a gift card event right now!
2673,2020-03-28 09:40:34,fq9uj7,"I just placed an ordered 2 weeks ago, had the option of free non tracked shipping or $2 tracked shipping.

Edit:  wtf you’re right! Now when I try to check out there’s no more free shipping option, only DHL or ems.  A couple weeks ago I ordered a Huxley cream from jolse, when checking out I was surprised it was free shipping for us Canadians.  I got my order really fast, I couldn’t believe it, like so fast I didn’t even bother to check the tracking number yet.  When I looked at the envelope, it came from an address in Toronto (North York area)."
2674,2020-03-28 17:43:48,fq9uj7,"No, not for this sale, it’s their friend and family sale.  Normally it’s 15%off with their credit card and 10 % off without the card but this time it’s 15 % off no matter how you pay. But 10% off for appliances and mattress etc, I didn’t think we cared about mattresses in this sub so I didn’t bother mentioning it."
2675,2020-03-28 03:47:55,fq9uj7,"There are duties but you are given the option of paying them when you check out. I’ve ordered twice and both my orders have been around 80$ CAD before duties, the duties for both the orders were around 11-15$ CAD"
2676,2020-03-28 01:51:13,fq9uj7,Still shows up as free when I enter a total in less than $50
2677,2020-03-28 04:36:27,fq9uj7,"This is actually a great idea; we're doing it with groceries that don't have to be refrigerated. The virus can't survive longer than three days, so as long as you're washing your hands after handling you're all good."

2679,2020-03-28 12:42:27,fq9uj7,This! Picked up Viseart Milieu and it came to $75CAD with tax and duty. Should be here next week ish....great deal!
2680,2020-03-28 19:33:12,fq9uj7,"Yeah they normally do have it, but all the biggest Korean based stores are restricting shipping to Canada due to issues with the shippers. Really sucks."
2681,2020-03-28 18:08:40,fq9uj7,Oh I misread that you are right. I just saw the two percentages and jumped the gun cause they do that sale a lot. My bad!
2682,2020-03-29 02:36:23,fq9uj7,"Trying the code with Clinique and it says it’s not eligible, FRIENDS code. Am I doing something wrong?"
2683,2020-03-28 04:10:02,fq9uj7,Not on my end. 🤷‍♀️
2684,2020-03-28 02:50:39,fq9uj7,"Sorry, I meant to say only with a min of $50"
2685,2020-03-28 06:58:51,fq9uj7,"I’ve been dunking everything is a sink of soap and light bleach solution then rinsing it. Fresh veggies and fruit too. Salad from premix bags only. [Edit: to clarify, I’m only eating prepackaged salads instead of selecting fresh lettuce and would rinse the leaves in regular water, not the solution]. And I do try to only eat cooked vegetables instead of raw ones.

Edit: Here’s the government link for using chlorine solution to clean produce. I wouldn’t put any prepackaged items in, like blueberries, but oranges, bananas, onions or carrots, that people handle while selecting, will get washed.

2686,2020-03-28 14:35:26,fq9uj7,The bleach solution isn't safe idea for fruit and veggies tbh. Soap + water + some friction is enough to clean your hands and it'll do the trick with whatever else needs to be cleaned :)
2687,2020-03-28 17:14:30,fq9uj7,"Thanks! I came across this site that shows the proper usage of chlorine to wash fruits and veggies.

2700,2020-03-31 22:48:58,fpuco7,"I'm pretty late to thos Dahvie Vanity thing. Can you clear something up for me? Are we talking about Jefree Star, the make-up guy here?"
2701,2020-03-27 17:39:03,fpuco7,"I’d forgotten about that comment, I’ve seen in a few places that he “grew up poor,” I wonder if that’s just bad reporting or if he straight up lied about it."
2702,2020-05-01 09:22:51,fpuco7,"That makes sense.  I heard that he was trying to fly a 16 year old to Florida to meet him.  Florida has an AOC of 18 and a close in age exemption which states that 16-17 year olds can be with people up to 23.  Neither of those laws protects Dahvie.  It makes sense that he might have influence over the cops, because if not, this doesn't add up."
2703,2020-04-01 05:31:23,fpuco7,I’m not too well versed on american law sorry :/
2704,2020-03-31 23:10:24,fpuco7,Yep! He actually started out on MySpace as a singer in the mid 2000s he never really went mainstream tho
2705,2020-05-01 09:28:59,fpuco7,"Yes.  That would be him.  Jeffree and Dahvie have known each other for a while and there is evidence that Jeffree knew about Dahvie going after underage girls (by underage, I mean very underage.  Most of the girls were under 16 at the time, which is the lowest AOC in the US and is still considered a minor in pretty much every other way other than AOC)."
2706,2020-04-01 06:17:22,fpuco7,"That’s alright! I think it varies by state, but basically- almost all crimes have a set amount of time to be brought to a court. Even murder used to (this changed, though). This specific situation might be a bit different, though, because Dahvie’s victims seemed to be young teens (or even pre-teens) when they came into contact with him; they probably would not have realized these actions were criminal in nature at the time, even if they were scary or unpleasant. They just didn’t know better."
2707,2020-06-30 03:01:17,fpuco7,"Child molestation has no statue of limitations in any US state any longer.

You can be on your death bed and say ""that one Father told me to stroke his ball sack 10 times instead of hail merrys. Yeah I was 11..."".

Romeo and Juliet laws are state to state and hard to prosecute. A young woman may be put on stand for witnessing her own trauma. She might slip up and say ""I was 11 and all my friends loved him... So I did."". 

He would most likely be acquitted of the heavier charges.

God I'm so sorry to anyone whose encountered this cunt. I left the scene in 2008 or so. I was noticing weird situations with bands even then."
2708,2020-03-27 13:02:22,fptigw,"I saw your edit and just wanted to say:

Whatever works for YOU!!! I am a very visual person but would never think to PUT THE PAN BACK.  Gotdamn I bet that is satisfying as all get out!!!

I'm happy you found something that works! Even if it's improving on something that has been around. If that last step is what motivates you, then so much the better."
2709,2020-03-27 09:40:38,fptigw,"This is a great idea! I have a lot of palettes, and have a few favorite shades in each one. I may have to try this. How do you de-pot them so cleanly?"
2710,2020-03-27 15:40:26,fptigw,"Well can a lady get a NSFW warning, the organizational porn here between the palettes and the spreadsheet got me fanning myself. Whew. Well done!"
2711,2020-03-27 12:03:07,fptigw,"I love this, what a great method! Seems like fun too"
2712,2020-03-27 12:56:05,fptigw,"I think that’s a good idea. I am a sucker for packaging and keeping shadows together, so I don’t tend to de-pot the shadows I use the most. You’re method is so much more practical."
2713,2020-03-27 17:28:53,fptigw,Wow thia sounds like a good method. I knew about depotting but to put them back after hitting pan is smart. Only thing i would suggest is making a franken color with ones that are too light/bold to make a useable color.
2714,2020-03-30 02:58:27,fptigw,"I did this with my Naked palettes! I popped the shades I wanted to use, 3-4 at a time, into a magnetic palette. As I finished one I would rotate in another and put the empty pan back. It was SO satisfying to place the empty pans back in the palette packaging!!"
2715,2020-03-27 13:54:32,fptigw,The only way to depot faster is to use them more often. So you can either do makeup on others or you can do makeup charts. You can make your own (use a toothy paper like for pastels or water color) or you can find some online. The face charts are kinda fun cus then you’ll have a little portfolio of all your favorite looks and you can be extra creative and try things out before trying on your face.
2716,2020-03-27 13:05:51,fptigw,"Haha thank you for this comment! It really does help. And then once I have a few baby pans, I get to take a picture and post on r/panporn (all time favorite sub) which makes it even more motivating! Haha."
2717,2020-03-27 15:02:50,fptigw,"I agree, whatever works for you! Makeup is inherently extra because we are beautiful as we are but choose to add something to our faces for our own reasons. I think this is a really cool system."
2718,2020-03-27 09:55:20,fptigw,"Yes try it! Well I use a really sharp knife and just wiggle it out slowly. This is what I’ve found:

Palettes easy to depot: Colourpop, Natasha Denona, and Tarte (these are all magnetic so just use a strong magnetic) 

Palettes that are fairly easy but will require a depoting tool: Urban Decay, ABH, Jeffree Star, Lorac (Lorac is fairly easy but the packaging for mine is pretty damaged, the others are pretty easy without damaging the palettes)  

Palettes that are pretty much impossible to depot without damaging the packaging or the shadows: Morphe, Violet Voss, Too Faced chocolate bar packaging, Huda small palettes"
2719,2020-03-27 16:50:15,fptigw,Haha this made me laugh! Literally the only thing in my life that I organize is my makeup 😅
2720,2020-03-27 12:08:45,fptigw,It’s super fun! I love organizing the shadows haha
2721,2020-03-28 03:32:49,fptigw,This is what I  need in my life!
2722,2020-03-28 02:33:03,fptigw,Nyx is also impossible to depot.

2795,2020-03-25 11:12:21,fonb3p,Looks lovely 😍 you could try putting something on your lower lash to make it pop x
2796,2020-03-25 11:24:37,fonb3p,Thanks! I sometimes do haha just relaxing in lazy clothes now
2797,2020-03-25 11:26:58,fonb3p,Hehe I'm awful at doing lower lash lines I've tried  a million times any suggestions? but thank you so much!

But with what Trisha Paytas is currently up to, I just cannot stand having anything around that reminds me off her irl too. The good thing about not being allowed to go outside is that no one sees you running around with crazy hot pink eyeshadow all over lol"
2802,2020-03-25 14:08:21,fom4h3,I love how you're avoiding all the pressed designs
2803,2020-03-25 13:15:09,fom4h3,"Honestly, this shade reminds me of Jeffree Star’s MySpace days!"
2804,2020-03-25 14:31:47,fom4h3,"I just got this palette! I was surprised that yellow wasn’t as neon as it looks in the pan. It’s my first JSC palette, so far I like the formula. Haven’t used Trisha yet, it’s not my go to color and she’s just a trash person."
2805,2020-03-26 06:07:41,fom4h3,I was so sad when that shade was included. If she just like went and had a real life off the internet I'd be pleased. Lmao.
2806,2020-03-25 16:22:32,fom4h3,"I considered it, but it’s not a shade I would normally wear that often anyways. So I just thought that I would use my quarantine playing around with some new colours!"
2807,2020-03-25 16:20:32,fom4h3,came here to say this lol

2811,2020-03-25 18:40:41,fom4h3,J* is trash too.
2812,2020-03-25 16:23:28,fom4h3,I can’t understand how some people don’t hahahha
2813,2020-03-25 16:26:01,fom4h3,"Same, I was most excited for the yellow shade, but unfortunately, it doesn’t really show up on my skin tone. The formula is good though. If you ever do start using Trisha, be aware that it’s a bitch to get off!"
2814,2020-03-25 18:40:19,fom4h3,JS is trash as well.
2815,2020-03-25 09:24:06,fom4h3,"Wow, remember ""outside""? Good times..."
2816,2020-03-25 09:46:18,fom4h3,Not judging you at all! I’m just too insecure to do anything that draws too much attention to me - working on it though!
2817,2020-03-25 11:29:33,fom4h3,She has self diagnosed herself with dissociative identity disorder and is continuing to offend everyone
2818,2020-03-26 00:16:33,fom4h3,"He’s much worse than Trisha imo. Trisha is a disgusting troll. Jeffree is a disgusting racist, sexist, homophobic, anti Semite, rape enabling, molester, pos."

):"

2848,2020-03-25 02:40:10,fobxq2,"I once bleached my eyebrows to dye them gray/silver, it didn't work out well and had to dye them back to black, meanwhile I took the chance to prank my mom into me having to shave them off a week before a family get-together, priceless stuff

2878,2020-03-23 22:53:24,fnr4yz,Lethal Cosmetics also offers a customizable [palette designer](https://www.lethalcosmetics.com/palette-designer/).
2879,2020-03-23 20:42:06,fnr4yz,I haven't tried the brand but I always see good reviews on YouTube channels but maybe Glam Lite cake palette?
2880,2020-03-23 22:07:01,fnr4yz,"These are all currently out of stock due to supply/materials issues, but some of the Menagerie palettes have similar colors. 

https://www.menageriecosmetics.com/collections/eyeshadow-palettes

I think between Feral, Whalesong and Violet Ink you'd have most of those colors."
2881,2020-03-24 01:47:30,fnr4yz,Notoriously Morbid too. Non indie? Revolution makeup from England.
2882,2020-03-25 02:23:22,fnr4yz,"Sugarpill fun size maybe? It’s all-matte but pastel and bright. If you’re looking for blue & green I second menagerie whale song and they also have a custom palette builder on their site. The shroud cosmetics creepy cute palette also has some famously good pastels for the pastel mint, baby blue, and lavender (also available as singles). Their Divinity palette has some jewel tones, too. Colourpop blue moon is a really really good blue palette and you can catch it for $9 on sale."

2901,2020-03-23 13:05:32,fng29y,I've noticed that too! I think we'd know if Diva Lynn was sick or otherwise not in good health. He's been SUPER trasnparent about his babies

2903,2020-03-23 20:12:09,fng29y,True that!
2904,2020-03-23 02:07:29,fnbvuf,I’m sorry sounds frustrating as hell! I don’t have kids but I have 7 younger siblings who used to destroy all my shit when I was at school haha I used to say I can never have anything nice! that was probably 10x worse for my mom. Hopefully by seeing how sad you were about it they never touch your makeup again.
2905,2020-03-23 02:04:43,fnbvuf,Probably should be keeping an eye on 2/3 year olds. What if one of them had gotten hurt or into something more dangerous?
2906,2020-03-23 02:13:45,fnbvuf,"Honestly, I know this is not what you want to hear right now, but I’d do anything to have been able to have kids. Your boys are worth so much more than any amount of makeup. Forgive them, love them, and give them hugs."
2907,2020-03-23 16:05:23,fnbvuf,"Maybe you can think of it as an opportunity to get new makeup, idk. Im sorry this happened sounds super irritating."
2908,2020-03-23 02:13:38,fnbvuf,"Ouch, I'm so sorry to hear that. Don't have kids because it's just as bad except you can't move away."
2909,2020-03-23 02:12:14,fnbvuf,Usually that would be the case. My husband was supposed to be watching them. Thank you for the kind advice.
2910,2020-03-24 00:55:12,fnbvuf,"Oh come on. There are going to be times when you cant be staring at your kids the whole time you're in the house. Mom cant do 1000 things at once and never once take her eyes off the kids. My parents let me wander off in a cow field once, shit happens."
2911,2020-03-23 02:27:57,fnbvuf,"As much as I love them, my makeup was the one thing that keeps me sane in this very miserable, anxiety driven world. It was therapeutic for me to get ready in the morning. It was one my time to focus on me. And now I don't get to."
2912,2020-03-24 01:00:36,fnbvuf,This is not fair. I'm sure she loves her kids and would do anything and give anything in the world for them. That doesnt mean she's not allowed to be upset with them and vent. I never take the people i love for granted but sometimes i get mad at them. Also you cant just go around letting kids get away with anything just because some people cant have them. I'm sorry if that seems insensitive.
2913,2020-03-24 11:40:22,fnbvuf,"Just saying if a two or three year old fell down her stairs or got into medication or something else harmful it would be such a shame. 

I raised kids. It wasn’t that hard to keep an eye on them, even when I was a single mom. And that’s ridiculous that your parent let you wander off - not the best example."
2914,2020-03-24 12:10:26,fnbvuf,"Well, congratulations, Ms. Perfect Parent.  Do you have anything more helpful to offer OP than suggestions to go back in time?"
2915,2020-03-24 13:46:00,fnbvuf,I'm not saying you should lose your kids in a cow field. But I am saying that kids are going to be kids and they're going to get into stuff. That's why they make baby gates for stairs and why people who aren't idiots lock away their medications if there are kids in the house.

2919,2020-03-22 22:52:27,fn54wt,"Interesting, however, a couple days ago he also sent out 7,500$ (cashapp weekly limit) to different people who are struggling.. so that means 250 to one person, 600 to another, etc. So there you go, he gave money to multiple people, plus the 30k to another person."
2920,2020-03-22 20:30:20,fn54wt,Atleast hes still paying his employees during the crisis. Hes already done way more with that alone than most other large business owners.
2921,2020-03-22 23:28:17,fn54wt,"I mean, Jeffree Star is a narcissistic attention whore, that's his brand. And you're right, this is a shameless and transparent act of self-promotion. But he's been giving cash away on Twitter for the past two days, and you know what, he's technically still helping people. Let him bask in the warm glow of his self-congratulation. For all his supercars and closets full of $50k handbags, he's a lonely man."
2922,2020-03-22 20:47:59,fn54wt,Jeffree Star? Narcissistic? No wayyy! :O
2923,2020-03-22 20:42:12,fn54wt,"It doesn’t matter what the motivation is does it help somebody in the end, that’s all it matters. There is nothing free in this life. Every person who does giving gets something in the end. 

Having said that sharing and showing off good deeds inspires others to do it so. I wish people would get that. Just like any stupid challenges people start following suit as well rich or not. Take the trash tag for instance. These people really put in the time and do good, but they still post it and get upvotes and that makes them feel good. Some will call that karma whoring, but even then does it make other people do the same or not? Does it matter they do it for the upvotes or not? No. 

There is not a single person that does good that doesn’t get something in return whether that’s publicity, tax breaks, a few upvotes or likes, or satisfying their ego."
2924,2020-03-22 20:06:10,fn54wt,"He's giving away 30,000$ of money out of his own pocket. The person who receives it isn't entitled to anything. Would it be cooler if he did it with no PR involved? Yes it would. But to the person who receives that money its biggest act of kindness in the world."
2925,2020-03-22 22:19:30,fn54wt,"If you did your research, he already gave away smaller amounts of money to random people in need during this time and he occasionally supports good causes with large sums of money without it being on social media. He is not obligated to do this..."
2926,2020-03-22 21:07:59,fn54wt,Most people fall for this type of self promotion without seeing it for what it is. I hear you. It was a big trend for awhile (not sure if it still is) of hiding money in some random place and watching people scramble looking for it. Getting personal pleasure out of *having the power* to make people behave a certain way is worth whatever money the narcissist spends on it.
2927,2020-03-23 02:53:31,fn54wt,"True, but I have no dignity, and will disagree and bake him a cake if I get $30k"
2928,2020-03-22 20:07:03,fn54wt,"Oh relax. I know you're not doing extra to help out, and neither am I. I would only step up like that for two people — my parents.

That money will help someone, even if it's one person. That money will make it easier for someone to stay at home comfortably and keeping at-risk people safe. Maybe they'll pay it forward.

Regardless, big donations, even if only one person benefits, will ripple more in the long run.

Unless you can help out people like this, you don't get to complain. Stay inside and humble yourself."
2929,2020-03-22 21:00:57,fn54wt,"He's giving away his money, he's allowed to do it however he wishes. I don't see you giving away $30,000. Have you given away $30,000 to anybody? Ever? Celebrities have the money to do what he is doing just like other celebrities have. It's good that he's giving the money away to somebody who will probably need it. I never understood people's being against somebody very wealthy giving away money just at random and or because of their story.

Why not 300 $100 winners? Because $100 is not going to do anything for you. The whole thing about $30,000 is to most people it's a lot of fucking money and it can and could pay for almost a year of living. You will always have critics of everything whether it's politics, celebrities or anything, you are just being someone criticizing somebody for giving away money that will in the end help somebody.

I don't care for celebrities, I enjoy the movies they make and that is about it. All they ever do is point fingers at one another and then bash other ultra wealthy people, they're all the same."
2930,2020-03-23 19:17:35,fn54wt,"J* is essentially investing $30,000 in his own social media engagement and influence. 

He regularly spends that much on designer goods (allegedly). He’s a racist misogynist who is gaining followers/recognition for one generous act. I’m so over him and I wish he wasn’t representative of the beauty community but his visibility ensures he’s the metric by which beauty people are judged. 🙄🙄🙄"
2931,2020-03-22 20:32:32,fn54wt,OP is just mad that he’s not the one getting the money.
2932,2020-03-22 21:45:34,fn54wt,"I don't know if you actually watch his content or not, but Jeffree Star already donates alot, for example he donated 125k to the LGBT Center in Los Angles.

I don't really agree that he's ""narcissistic"". It doesn't seem like him."
2933,2020-03-22 21:40:00,fn54wt,"i’m not too sure about this one. 

like other people said, he is giving away $30,000 of his OWN money. however he wants to do it is his prerogative. not to mention, almost all companies/big influencers use social media as their giveaway platform. literally. “retweet” or “follow/subscribe “, etc. etc.

i think he is trying to give back to his followers & supporters specifically, to help them in their times of need. perhaps that is why he’s using twitter, so HIS followers see it. i totally get where you’re coming from, but the whole “why only give to one person?” seems almost nitpick-y. he’s helping someone out there, that should be all that matters. do you get upset every time a brand or influencer hosts giveaways that have follow/like/repost stipulations? it’s free."
2934,2020-03-23 06:15:26,fn54wt,"I'd be shocked if anyone even gets the damn money. But I have my doubts.

There was a person on my twitter feed that had the overstretched offer that they'll give 100 CAD to like several individuals after a few tweets. They got overwhelmed. Just, don't do things like that."
2935,2020-03-23 14:51:45,fn54wt,He is a narcissist but him giving money away for retweets isn’t a bad thing.  How is it a bad thing?
2936,2020-03-22 20:48:03,fn54wt,Take a nap
2937,2020-03-22 21:34:23,fn54wt,"Jeffrey Star is the quintessential example of us allowing the wrong people to become rich. Dude's a shallow creep with no meaningful awareness of the real world outside his gaudy mansion. He's so unsettlingly comfortable being at the top that it's shocking to realize that he wasn't born there. He would probably see that as a compliment but it's really, *really* not.

(Also while Im on that tangent, Shane Dawson's the biggest idiot/out of touch jackass of them all for his ridiculous melodrama that exists solely to validate these people's unearned sense of importance)

And the best part is that all these normal people in the comments are defending him and making you the bad guy because hey, how much money have you given away? Never mind the fact that you literally CANT do what he's doing. Shame on you for not doing it, just shut up and let the rich do the talking, loser."
2938,2020-03-23 03:11:45,fn54wt,I haven't heard about this guy since 2005. Thanks OP.
2939,2020-03-23 04:39:53,fn54wt,"I guess my question is, who cares? If the end result is that someone out there can afford to live then I’m all for it. He’s given out a lot of cash recently and someone said he’s been paying his employees during the pandemic.

I get you’re skeptical of his motives. But now is not the time to wag your finger at a celebrity doing their part to help others. Idc who he is. If he offers ME $30,000 I’m saying “thanks girlie, love yaaa” 😂

EDIT. Misspelling a word."
2940,2020-03-23 04:54:56,fn54wt,"I saw this. I entered, personally. Could it be narcissism? Yes. Could it be regular philanthropy? Sure. 

Either way, it’s not like I’m risking anything. A like and a follow? It’s not exactly a super slanted trade. 30k or a small sum via cashapp in exchange for magic internet points? Sign me up. 

So he’ll sleep well tonight feeling like he did something good. Big deal."
2941,2020-03-23 05:55:40,fn54wt,"Okay don’t act like you didn’t retweet and follow tho before you came here to write this...$30,000 is $30,000"
2942,2020-03-23 06:37:18,fn54wt,"I agree with the fact that celebrities have been using the virus and donating for attention, however I don’t think we should criticize this. Donations and help, no matter why given, are always good. I’m gonna let the celebrities keep on promoting themselves through donating. As far as I’m concerned, as long as they give money, everyone wins."
2943,2020-03-23 11:23:07,fn54wt,"So I do wanna day that 1) he doesn’t have to give out any money let alone the money she’s been paying out for the past week or so, and 2) so what if he’s getting something out of helping people? It’s his 30k and however he wants to give it away is his choice. Also I wanted to mention that he paid for a funeral arrangements for a fan that passed away and didn’t comment on it, a true narcissist would repeatedly remind you that he’s the reason that fan is resting in peace. He might be egotistical, but not a true narcissist. Edit:spelling"
2944,2020-03-22 20:34:43,fn54wt,"I don’t disagree with any of this! My qualms are with what I personally view as a millionaire dangling a $30,000 carrot and toying with less fortunate people’s emotions. I totally agree that for the one random person who does win, it’s an objectively positive thing. I just think it’s tasteless, reckless, and self-serving to do it as what is essentially a PR Twitter raffle. Again, do agree with your sentiments!"
2945,2020-03-22 21:45:50,fn54wt,">Getting personal pleasure out of having the power to make people behave a certain way is worth whatever money the narcissist spends on it.

Omg this is so true ! 😥"
2946,2020-03-22 22:16:44,fn54wt,"Im split between this and OP. On one side its fairly obvious jeff star is doing this to fuel his ego and just knowing about some of the twisted shit he's done, really makes me sad that he has this much influence... 

But at the end of the day its still gonna help someone and that is a good thing. 

But then again no one that lives in a first world country that pays taxes should be put in a position where he absolutely needs a random millionaires hand out... 

So I think imma just say that he did a good thing but that doesnt make him a good person but its a good step towards bettering himself and im all for that."
2947,2020-03-22 20:43:57,fn54wt,Yep
2948,2020-03-22 22:22:02,fn54wt,"Lmao cmon now if theres a word to describe him its narcissistic. 

Egomaniac works too I guess."
2949,2020-03-22 22:25:36,fn54wt,"The issue lies with the fact that this isnt a brand doing a giveaway in a transparent way like you mentioned. 

This is a PR stunt made by an egomaniac that is essentially capitalizing on a global pandemic. 

I do share your feelings that this money will help someone out but you should look at the context and the motivations he has. Jeff star donating money is a good thing, this just doesnt make him a good person because of the benefit he'll make off of this."
2950,2020-03-22 21:40:34,fn54wt,"That's exactly what it is. Turning it into a public spectacle so he can watch the peasants fight over it and tweet about how desperately they need his help is tasteless, dystopian, and more telling of his character than he realizes."
2951,2020-03-22 21:34:32,fn54wt,"Hopefully he doesn't follow through, then?"
2952,2020-03-23 00:05:27,fn54wt,"Everyone helps out in their own self-interest. Even if you act selflessly, you're still doing it because it makes you feel good on the inside.We don't help people because we want to feel bad if that makes sense.

I do think you strike a balanced view though, and I appreciate it!"
2953,2020-03-22 22:39:13,fn54wt,"i understand! i didn’t say it made him a good person or anything of the sort. i just think that everyone who does social media giveaways benefits from doing so. it’s always a pr stunt when they want someone to like/follow.

but at the end of the day, he is giving away $30,000, which is amazing in itself and will help someone considerably. 

my main problem with the post was the “why not give to more people” deal. i just personally didn’t agree with that! if someone is paying out of pocket, it’s their decision who it goes to. that’s all, really!"
2954,2020-03-22 21:37:45,fn54wt,"Not thinking or saying that at all. On that note though, I hope he doesn’t name the winner. That person would inevitably be inundated with a variety of attention."

2959,2020-03-22 05:43:07,fmuvbj,Fine by me. I don’t think it’d really matter to me at all. Character is the most important thing imo. How masculine or feminine you are really doesn’t matter at all.
2960,2020-03-22 05:56:14,fmuvbj,"Fine by me. 

I would raise my kids to live the life they want, not the one I want for them. Whether they are feminine or masculine, I want them to be happy being them, and to put their time and effort being the best they can be."
2961,2020-03-22 17:17:36,fmuvbj,"Do you have some examples that aren't cross-dressers?

Or are you specifically asking about a son that is a 24/7 cross-dresser, or...?"
2962,2020-03-22 06:01:46,fmuvbj,"Only James charles or jeffrey star? I guess just roll with it.

But if he went full Liberace or rupaul, that is where i would draw the line and still love him."
2963,2020-03-22 05:43:10,fmuvbj,is your son a suicidal feminine young adult by any chance?
2964,2020-03-22 06:47:30,fmuvbj,I wouldn’t care but care. U know what I mean. I’ll let him be him
2965,2020-03-22 07:58:05,fmuvbj,I would want my child to be happy and will accept him regardless.
2966,2020-03-22 08:27:28,fmuvbj,He's still my son. I'd rather he be feminine than repress his emotions anyway.
2967,2020-03-22 12:39:32,fmuvbj,"Everyone does whatever they think will bring them the lives that they want. If he's behaving in an over the top feminine way, he's trying to attract a certain type of attention that he thinks will make him happy.

That can of behaviour is fleeting anyway. You don't see many 50 year old men prancing about."
2968,2020-03-22 14:32:41,fmuvbj,I worry about bigger things like what I'm gonna have for dinner tonight.
2969,2020-03-23 11:33:21,fmuvbj,I wouldn't care one bit. I fail to see why it would be a problem.
2970,2020-03-22 05:48:40,fmuvbj,"I’d be really upset for a minute... because humans have greatly outrageous expectations.

but then I’d get over it because after all I raised my kids to be good, loving, emotionally intelligent people. That’s all that matters, really. 

(My kids life is not mine to live)"
2971,2020-03-22 05:49:47,fmuvbj,"I wouldn't give a shit. If he wants to do it and it makes him happy then that's terrific. No force on this planet will stop my son from being feminine so long as he wants to and I will make sure of that.

But I don't even have a son so what the hell am I talking about?"
2972,2020-03-22 05:54:24,fmuvbj,I would give no fucks. I would be more concerned with my son’s wellbeing and whether or not I raised a responsible man regardless of feminine/masculine mannerisms.
2973,2020-03-22 05:58:10,fmuvbj,"I would be a lot more worried that my kid bought into ""femenine"" vs ""masculine"" thing than about if they wanted to wear makeup"
2974,2020-03-22 06:06:23,fmuvbj,"I would be pissed off if my son turned out at all like James Charles, because I wouldn't want my son's role model to be a sex offender.

I really hate the fact that the biggest model society has for ""femininity in men"" happens to be a terrible person."
2975,2020-03-22 08:03:34,fmuvbj,"I mean I’d initially be kind of disappointed because I want to do many things with my future son, BUT he is my son and I’ll still love him"
2976,2020-03-22 05:47:11,fmuvbj,"I’d honestly be pissed off, Still wouldnt turn my back on him though"
2977,2020-03-22 06:04:19,fmuvbj,"I probably have at least one biological kid somewhere, there's a lot of my life I have trouble remembering - and so there's a fifty ish percent chance that one of them is a son. And so if all those hypotheticals come true, and the son is feminine, I certainly don't care."
2978,2020-03-22 13:31:09,fmuvbj,i would be deeply saddened. It would reflect more on me as his father than him though.
2979,2020-03-22 07:43:21,fmuvbj,"I'd be upset.

There's a lot of feminine people in the world. There's a lot less masculine people. And given the way social expectations are set up, it's easier to be feminine. So it would feel like my son is taking the easy way out."

2989,2020-03-22 18:36:13,fmuvbj,Well I assume they’re not going to be that into video games and sports
2990,2020-03-22 05:51:40,fmuvbj,Just because he’d probably look like me. That means there would be gay me running around.
2991,2020-03-22 13:42:24,fmuvbj,"Because society is not kind to feminine boys who become feminine men.

Women generally dont like feminine men, he will have a hard time in his romantic pursuits of women.

They are not seen as strong/competent/general masculine men in their work efforts either, they will struggle with gaining respect from coworkers and their managers. Since they will be seen as weaker and less competent, they will likely not be as promoted as a more masculine man, and if they do get to a management level they will struggle with respect from their subordinates.

In all his life will be much harder. And it would reflect on my failure as a father to guide him."

3002,2020-03-22 07:40:34,fmuvbj,">if he went full Liberace or rupaul, that is where i would draw the line

Right here is where you said you would draw the line. I asked you why you would draw the line. So to quote you:

>Read the whole thing and sound it out from start to finish."
3003,2020-03-23 15:43:58,fmuvbj,I don't know James so I wouldn't know.
3004,2020-03-22 06:04:18,fmuvbj,K
3005,2020-03-22 07:53:43,fmuvbj,"Funny how u only partially quote and abridge the whole sentence. The quote does not end @ ""draw the line""

Maybe read the WHOLE SENTENCE first and tell me again if I drew a line. Take ur time, sound it out if u have too.

I'll wait."
3006,2020-03-22 08:00:24,fmuvbj,"Ok here's the whole sentence:

>But if he went full Liberace or rupaul, that is where i would draw the line and still love him.

Right there you said you would draw the line. You also said you would still love him. I never questioned whether you would love him, I questioned why you would draw the line, as you said you would draw the line.

So I ask again, why would you draw the line at going full Liberace or rupaul?"
3007,2020-03-22 08:05:15,fmuvbj,"So i love my son.

 I love my son if he was jeff star poofta

I love my son if he was Liberace gay

All the end results are the same, was there a line drawn?"
3008,2020-03-22 08:27:15,fmuvbj,"I never questioned your love for him, you were the one who said you would draw a line. If there was no line drawn why would you say you would draw a line?"
3009,2020-03-22 08:40:16,fmuvbj,"You're a bit slow aren't you? (Not trying to be offensive)
He was joking by saying he would draw the line and still love him 
In short: he still loves him, no matter how masculine or feminine his son is"
3010,2020-03-22 08:48:35,fmuvbj,"Someone with a high level of reading comprehension.

3020,2020-04-21 12:15:40,g5dt3c,"Jeffree star is stocked on beauty bay, so that avoids tax issues unless the item is out of stock/not listed yet.

I ordered a jeffree star mystery box last year and it got caught by Royal Mail, and I had to pay. The box was about $40 +$10 shipping, and I think it cost £8 vat + £8 Royal Mail handling fee (a fee to basically to cover their effort to charge me!). I think it worked out as 20% tax of the total order cost (item + shipping) and then the £8 Royal Mail fee was a set amount. 

A number of other us makeup companies include vat in their prices/add it at checkout to avoid this issue, and have free shipping over a certain amount (colourpop and tarte are 2 I’ve ordered from multiple times). Also Sephora France stocks some stuff and ships to the uk at a flat €9.90 fee, so might be worth looking at if there’s a number of products you want (don’t think they have kylie though), I ordered some of the game of thrones x ud collection from them. And there’s lots of uk websites so a lot of us brands are able to be bought somewhere without tax issues.

Also at the moment a lot of courier services are having delays due to coronavirus, so just a warning to expect that especially if you order from abroad.

Sorry if it’s extra info you don’t need, but figured it might be useful."

A year later, he was friends with dahvie vanity and played it off like he never made the accusations 

Now, with dahvie vanity under investigation by Chris Hansen, Jeffree is now trying to say that those tweets were photoshopped, and he’s saying that no one asked him about Dahvie.  He is still trying to defend a child molester

3106,2020-04-25 16:32:55,g5cwkr,"in theory i agree with this, but the big tea channels and the ones that get recommended don’t ever make negative videos on jeffree. they’re on his payroll. he sends them PR and invites them to events to make sure that they don’t report on him. so even though his older fans may know, id be willing to bet that a lot of his younger fans do not. in fact, i was a fan of jeffree and only found out about all of this this week, which is obviously when i stopped being a fan. all i’m saying is, it’s easy to not know what’s going on when the drama channels are his “friends” and they’re being gifted free products and exposure in exchange for their silence. nobody ever said they were ethical journalists !"
3107,2020-04-21 14:57:51,g5cwkr,"They just say he keeps apologizing and donates to make up for it. 

Cool.... doesn't change the fact he was a POS if he keeps doing things a POS would do."
3108,2020-04-22 05:01:40,g5cwkr,"to add more info, hes apart of the band Blood on the Dance Floor, and has recently rebranded himself as Kawaii Monster, also changed his instagram handle. you cant run forever, dahvie. the predator slayer is comin for you"
3109,2020-04-21 16:13:22,g5cwkr,"Anyone feel free to correct me if I’m wrong, but they recently broke up maybe a month and a half ago. But yeah, jeffery had a couple of past tweets about him being into straight men as well. Which is all fine and good so long as you dont make those men uncomfortable, ya feel"
3110,2020-04-22 05:04:27,g5cwkr,apparently Nathan since their breakup has been actually hanging around with girls and has a gf. I like to follow drama in my spare time and I have a shit ton of it during quarantine.

3116,2020-04-22 22:27:57,g5cwkr,Its kinda hard to see sarcasm through text
3117,2020-04-25 18:20:02,g5cwkr,You make a great point! Definitely a side I neglected to consider. A lot of bigger influencers and youtubers are able to use their money and influence to manipulate their narrative or get positive PR out there to overwhelm any negative.  It's easy to miss that if you're younger or just new to JS in general.  Makes sense.
3118,2020-04-22 00:06:53,g5cwkr,"And it would have just been a stupid phase, if not for the fact that there were clearly a LOT of pedophiles just *hanging* around."
3119,2020-04-23 13:11:45,g5cwkr,Me????
3120,2020-04-21 19:20:35,g5cwkr,"And I didn’t, if I wasn’t drunk I 100% would of, but make no mistake you touch my penis without my permission like this turd did in the video and you 100% deserve to be fucking knocked in the face."
3121,2020-04-22 22:34:16,g5cwkr,"Naw, you’re right, men can’t actually be sexually assaulted."
3122,2020-04-21 20:06:11,g5cwkr,As a Gay™️ this is 100% correct
3123,2020-04-22 22:35:22,g5cwkr,Thanks for sharing
3124,2020-04-21 20:26:19,g5cwkr,Wut?
3125,2020-04-21 20:26:55,g5cwkr,Meaning no one should be sexually harassed no matter sexual orientation

But spreading hate about someone you’ve never personally met isn’t productive behavior and I would recommend simply moving on."

3242,2020-04-16 18:03:15,g2a3o8,"A lot of the stuff he’s done in the past he has apologized for and no longer does. People should be allowed to grow and be better people because nobody is perfect and we have to recognize that. And if any of the sexual harassment stuff was proven, he’d be in jail."

I'm all for forgiving and moving on but he never actually grew as a person. And there's literally a video of him groping a man, you can go ahead and try to disprove that if you want, the police won't do shit if a victim doesn't come forward ntm sexual assault cases are ridiculously hard to prove and when you're groped in the middle of a music festival by a stranger it's near impossible to prove, the police couldn't have done anything even if it was reported."

Would you like for me to write up a Jeffree Star shit list for you?"
3248,2020-04-16 09:27:02,g2a3o8,"Hahaha so you dedicated your useless time to dig up shit about a random person? 

Oh my lord. Do you really have nothing to live for?"

Are you morally bankrupt? it's not like any of this stuff is hard to find. And it's not like he ever became a better person, he is consistent with his assholery."
3250,2020-04-16 09:36:45,g2a3o8,"I’m not defending anyone. Can you point out where I defended anyone?  

I’m pointing out your pathetic excuses to hate on random people."
3251,2020-04-16 09:43:53,g2a3o8,"If you're not defending anyone then why are you even responding? because you're not impartial are you? you're painting valid reasons to dislike someone as pathetic excuses and calling all these real and proven occurrences, accusations."

3310,2020-05-03 15:00:03,gcppbn,"I had some rando have the audacity to tell me that he preferred women who didn’t wear so much makeup.

I told him I preferred men who kept their bullshit opinions to themselves and choked on them.

He did the fish face thing, and said, “That wasn’t nice.”

I smiled and said, “I’m not obliged to be nice to a douchebag who negs me, because he’s overcompensating for something else. Why don’t you choke on your own gall and die?”

He left in a HUFF. Who do these little men think they are, that we a) give a single, solitary fuck about their opinions, and b) that their negging actually works? Dude, we all know you’re either mad because you’re too short one way or another. Not my problem."
3311,2020-05-03 12:59:51,gcppbn,"Assert dominance, post picture with more products! 

But tbh, most men know nothing about make up anyways. Some people expect women to have nicely filled brows, long, black lashes and red luscious lips naturally without realizing unless you won the generic lottery or had work done, this ain't possible. 

Id say don't let it dull your sunshine! Keep posting content you want to post! Ignore the haters because for every hateful message you get, there's a handful of people who appreciate what you post more!"

I legit had a guy (who was with his wife no less!) pass by me and mumble under his breath, “Too much makeup...”

I turned around so GD fast! “Is it your face motherf*cker?!” 

You’d be surprised the way that people act when you actually say something back. They are usually huge wusses who avert their eyes and walk away with their tail between their legs.

Honestly, it’s none of their damn business what you do with your face or your body. Tell them to work on themselves. I’m not going to fit some unrealistic beauty standard or “fit in” just because you want me to. Who tf are you to me? Get outta here! 👋"

The variety of styles I see in the beauty industry is truly inspiring, and most everybody finds a niche doing the looks they love.

I hate getting “CC” have the time it’s not constructive it’s just rude) because I never ask. Like saying “wow this is way too much for me” is so annoying because I’m not doing it for you.

3327,2020-05-03 13:54:03,gcppbn,"For the internet trolls, reply 'lol' and ignore. Their opinions are useless to your life and undeserving of your energy.

For the IRL judgmentals, when they get preachy and virtuous about ""makeup is unnatural"", politely ask if they think showering is too much, because that does remove us from a natural state. Brushing your hair is the same, and shaving certainly doesn't happen ""spontaneously"" and ""naturally"". 

Point is, makeup can fully be part of a good grooming routine. It's another way to care for the bodies that haul us around. It is also creatively fulfilling, expressive, and downright delightful. 

It's hilarious that a joyful hobby is so controversial, and those who feel victimized by OTHER PEOPLE practicing it might consider self-reflecting. 

TL;DR: Do what makes you happy, beauty. You are only accountable for you 💖"
3328,2020-05-03 15:08:46,gcppbn,"Do you think it’s because makeup is labeled as ‘beauty’ so they project what they think is beautiful and mansplain what beauty means to them?

Maybe we should label it as ‘self-care’ haha. More inclusive, less potential for word vomit :)."

I met a guy sometime back at a get together and I wasn’t wearing any makeup and he told me that I looked like someone punched me in the face cause I have really dark circles under my eyes (its genetic). He ended up looking me up on Instagram and his first comment was “that’s too much makeup”. Honestly, it was so funny to me because he thought his words had so much power that he told me those things when I had just met him. Don’t let anyone (especially an irrelevant ass man) tell you what you can and can’t do, they’re always going to have something to say so you might as well do whatever the heck you want."

3331,2020-05-03 13:17:26,gcppbn,"This kind of behavior makes me angry. Some people tell me about how should I do my makeup,what should I wear etc like I wanted their opinion. Why not these people understand that I do my makeup how I want to look like or to express my self, not to make them like me. And about advice most of the time I say if I wanted their opinion I would've asked and appreciate if they didn't give me advice I don't want then thank them (not if they're cocky). But I'm a little aggressive about this stuff so not suitable for everyone I guess, maybe you could be a little nicer if you want."
3332,2020-05-03 16:25:19,gcppbn,"I had this happen on the day I was finally brave enough to wear makeup to school. I was pretty happy with the look that day tbh, I think it was just a bit of brown eyeshadow and liner, no lashes and a browny nude lipstick. It wasn’t like I was a beginner at makeup then, I just never really wore it out. Anyways, I got a couple of compliments that day until it got to this class where we had to sit in groups of 4 and in my group, there was a couple and another girl. While the other girl and I were talking about how I don’t usually wear makeup, the dude out of nowhere proclaimed to his girlfriend (that was sitting right freakin next to me!) that he preferred her with no makeup. But my dude, your girlfriend never wears/doesn’t even own makeup? And the girl talking to me wasn’t wearing any makeup, so it was pretty clear that he did that as his own sly way of saying he’d prefer women with no makeup without addressing me. The other girl in our group and I were just too baffled to say anything. The girlfriend apologized and told me she had no idea why he’d do that months after, but I’m not gonna lie, it was a bit traumatizing since it was my first time wearing makeup out and it made me not wanna try again till college. Now I’m wearing glitter to the supermarket lol

That one incident aside, it will come up multiple times more in our lives. As frustrating as it is, I think we just have to come to terms with the fact that some men just won’t (not can’t, won’t) come to terms with the fact that we literally can not give a rats ass about what they prefer. And if it really bothers you, focus on what you have in comparison to what the person saying shit to you have. I have a loving and caring partner who doesn’t care if I wear makeup or not, he likes it either way. What does he have? An ego so big and insufferable that he can’t make proper female acquaintances 🤷🏻‍♀️"
3333,2020-05-03 16:51:39,gcppbn,"It annoyed me in my teens and early twenties when men would tell me that I look so much better without any makeup because those were the days that I loved makeup soo much.

From my mid twenties through late thirties I find it to be an absolute compliment. With so many other priorities that my days consist of now, I don't always make time to do a full face of makeup like I used to so it is a relief to hear someone say that to me."
3334,2020-05-03 15:03:16,gcppbn,"I know what that feels like... I get those comments all the time, online and even in person lol. But I always say to them that makeup is my passion, it makes me happy like no other thing does and I just express myself with makeup and no man or woman will ever stop me from wearing it ! And sometimes I say that I know I look good without makeup and with a more natural face but there’s no fun in it! I love wearing purple glitter in the morning lol :) Don’t let those people annoy you! Most women that say you look better without makeup don’t even know how to apply foundation correctly trust me ! And men ... well ... they think all we do is for them, but they are so so wrong !"

3338,2020-05-03 17:01:47,gcppbn,There was a bitter older woman at work who would always tell me things about wearing 'clown makeup' since I wear colors. She also spread rumors that I said she was ugly and her breath stunk so idk what her problem was. I didn't let it bother me.

It’s so weird, it’s always delivered like they’re doing you a favor by making you feel uncomfortable about how you’ve chosen to present yourself. It’s so bizarre. If you tell someone how to do their makeup without being asked, you’re not being helpful, you’re just being judgemental. Get off your high horse."

3343,2020-05-03 15:01:28,gcppbn,I wore make up yesterday and my boyfriend told me anytime he sees someone with make up he automatically thinks they're insecure.
3344,2020-05-03 16:23:05,gcppbn,"I get this all the time too. It used to bother me a bit as well as make me feel embarrassed. Then I realized I don't wear makeup to impress anyone, I wear it cause it's fun to do and I genuinely enjoy it. That realization took the embarrassment out of people's comments and now when I get told those things I just respond with, ""I know I don't need it but it's fun to do and makes me happy"". People usually respond well to that and are more understanding of why I wear it. Good luck and do you pretty gurl!"

3350,2020-05-03 23:08:41,gcppbn,"Sounds like a poor attempt at negging! Especially since it came through as a PM rather than a post on the thread. Here’s the quick definition from Wikipedia.

> Negging is an act of emotional manipulation whereby a person makes a deliberate backhanded compliment or otherwise flirtatious remark to another person to undermine their confidence and increase their need of the manipulator's approval. The term was coined and prescribed by pickup artists.

You wear as much or as little make up as you want, to make you feel good."
3351,2020-05-04 01:58:26,gcppbn,"Tips?? Girl just roll your eyes and move along. I get tired of explaining to people that makeup doesn’t just make me feel pretty, it makes me feel accomplished for having created something beautiful, and it’s fun....but if you feel like going down that road, then educate people who give you a hard time about it. Some people—especially guys—genuinely don’t know the motivations behind what we do, and that’s okay. 

But as a general rule, I think it’s tacky to tell someone how much better or worse they would look if they changed something about themselves. So if you feel agitated, or don’t want to give someone an explanation, then you have every right not to."

I recently had a director tell me my actress was wearing too much eyeliner, in front of my actress, to which the actress promptly replied, “I haven’t even been to makeup yet” and rolled her eyes. 

Case and point - some people don’t know shit and feel the need to tell you all about it despite being clueless. Next time just take a deep breath; breathe in serenity, breathe out bullshit. 

Also, you’ve probably put more time and effort into this whole situation than he will ever put into it and let’s be honest... there’s many better things to do than care what some rando online things about you. That skill in itself is an art form."

3368,2020-05-03 21:52:44,gcppbn,"I don’t mind? For me, makeup isn’t an art, it’s something I use to enhance myself. So when a few people tell me I look better this way or that way, I usually take their advice, because I don’t want to look bad. When guys say you’d look better with this or that, I’ve found that most of them don’t say it because they think I’m doing it for them, but because they’re humans who can see and have opinions on it. If someone looks really bad in something or could improve, I’d probably tell them too (provided the point was foe them to look good)."

3370,2020-05-03 23:25:00,gcppbn,"I think it's also that they have no clue what makeup looks like. For example, they might love a woman who posts fill glam that's heavily edited to about her skin- she doesn't look like it's caked on. But if that same woman posted a real-life picture that dares to show peach fuzz or texture, he might ridicule her for putting too much on. 

I posted my wedding makeup once because I was really pleased with how it turned out. I want checking comments because I was busy getting married, but when I looked a few days later, overweening folks were approve, but there is always that one dude who has to tell you you look like shit.

3385,2020-05-03 23:01:58,gcppbn,"This was my thought as well. Most men actually think that a “natural makeup” look is really women without makeup. And then some men will turn around and criticize women for not caring enough about their appearance, or looking presentable to their standards. There’s no winning, so just enjoy yourself!"

If he has the audacity to comment on someone elses appearance like that, he should be able to tolerate someone else commenting on his appearance, whether or not it is something that can be changed."
3418,2020-05-03 19:00:47,gcppbn,Actually with enough money you can change your height it's just very expensive and very very painful.

3425,2020-05-03 15:18:36,gcppbn,"True that since he does it daily.. and the amount of time he spends to look in the mirror before leaving, I don't even do that. And his two week hair cuts that he HAS to have. Good point this made me think who is really the insecure one. Because I stopped wearing make up shortly after I met him, but two year I'm like trying to reinvent myself and realise that I was a person before I met him.

Regardless what he thinks I'm still going to wear it. I actually love my bareface, but when I go out I want to look my best. Screw him.."
3426,2020-05-03 19:51:18,gcppbn,Exactly. If we were wearing it for ANYONE else... it would be other women. Do men wear expensive sneakers to impress women? I don't think so. They can't comprehend the same logic applies. Imo womens compliments are worth 100x more.

it's not a contest of who is a bigger asshole. and even if it is, i don't understand why would you want to be the winner. because making fun of his height only going to make him even more bitter and teach him nothing. he's only gonna feel justified in making fun of other women. shoving him down in a much more polite and less cruel way can shut him up for good. as well as make him feel ashamed, not angry. and usually shame is better teaching method than anger."
3434,2020-05-04 12:01:22,gcppbn,"height increasing surgery is still kind of new and it's disproportionate to makeup - both in price and pain, as well as time and effort put into it.

3454,2020-05-05 01:13:45,gclb94,"No, he's doing this because Dahvie Vanity, someone he toured with when he was a singer, has been trying to make a comeback. Years ago, he called out Dahvie for abusing underage girls but then retracted his statement, rubbing elbows and touring with him not long after. 

Now that Dahvie is back in the spotlight people are angry that Jeffree was complicit in the abuse and has been alleged to have been a witness, so he's trying to deflect and focus on some other drama, because the Dahvie accusations are legitimate and serious while his stuff with James is petty."
3455,2020-05-03 13:29:52,gclb94,I'm a huge jeffree fan  aswell but I cant shake the feeling that maybe starting the drama up again has something to do with instant influencer and the lime light being on James for something positive 🤔🤔🤔
3456,2020-05-05 12:24:27,gclb94,"Here is my conspiraspeculation about what happened...


1. I think Nathan had some kind of issue with James that he made Jeffree aware of...I don’t know WHAT but something. Maybe James hit on his brother, or looked at him the wrong way, or looked at Jeffree the wrong way etc etc etc who knows

2. I think he heard Tati’s story in the video and shortly after received a text, voicemail,email (whatever) from someone he knew fairly well or was connected too accusing James of doing something similar and inappropriate. So he decided to go on a full on Twitter rage campaign.

3. I think after this rampage his lawyers probably told him to stfu bc unless the person he talked to came forward, or had proof anything Jeffree said could be considered slanderous.

4. I think whatever he does have in his phone is probably not enough to take to the police...or if it was it may be outing a victim without their approval. So he made the video saying he was going to not show it to make himself look like the bigger person and avoid possible lawsuits and god knows what else if he played something that was a lie or out of context...even if wasn’t aware if it was one of those things.

NOW!!!:

I think after Jeffree and Nate broke up Jeffree May have started to not see everything with rose colored glasses anymore. I think he may have tweeted out to James about the Charlie video to try to contact him again. I think he probably even felt bad about what happened. 

However, during the keemstar interview when they were kind of insinuating he may be keeping things from everyone etc etc he had to back track a little and say that he did indeed have SOMETHING. However, he also reached out and BASICALLY said “hey James I have this come listen to it and explain it to me. I want to know if this is true or if this person was being untruthful with me some reason” 

ALL of this leads me to believe that some part of this had to do with Nathan or someone close to Nathan and now Jeffree is not sure who he should believe. It would make sense to me that if James was “inappropriate” with someone close to Nate,or with Nate himself, that Jeffree would IMMEDIATELY jump to his “rescue” by calling James a predator on Twitter.  It also explains why he would 100% believe someone then, but might be questioning it now. 

I don’t mean any of this to wipe any fault away from him or anything bc he has definitely f*d up.....but....from what info we have this makes the most sense to me."
3457,2020-05-06 03:49:25,gclb94,"I also thought maybe Nate and James had some kind of beef which made Jeffree jump in on his takedown. However like one of the interviewers pointed out, this whole James situation sounds eerily like the Dhavie Vanity situation. Even down to ""exposing"" him on Twitter and then turning around and working with him again. If he thinks James is a danger to society then why is he reaching out to him? It seems very suspicious at least to me, but that could be the case!"
3458,2020-05-18 04:16:31,gclb94,That indeed is a very excellent speculation!
3459,2020-06-06 20:16:27,gclb94,I think Nate may have had a role but Jeffree is pure evil- he probably encouraged Tati to post about james and his ‘manipulation to straight men’ and wanted him out of the way causes he’s Jeffrees main competition on the platform...
3460,2020-06-06 20:17:57,gclb94,Also he commented in on moms basement that he doesn’t care about numbers and then contradicted himself and said he already won and Tati was still in the red or somthing- he cares about James because he’s standing in his way to being on top. He’s a Physcopath who only cares about his wallet
3461,2020-05-06 03:51:15,gclb94,"That could definitely be it as well, I just thought it was coincidental that the dates matched up to some extent. like I said, just my thoughts!"
3462,2020-05-03 16:10:23,gclb94,"That could be it as well, if not a combination of the two, regardless I dont even think jeffree can hide that something big is up. Also cant shake the feeling Tati and James are talking again behind the scenes and this scares Jeffree so hes trying to get to James before Tati does. Why is Jeffree out of the blue telling James publically he has dirt on him and to call him?"
3463,2020-05-06 16:04:05,gclb94,"Well, he hasn’t worked with James again yet. That’s why what I think is that Jeffree doesn’t know what to think about James and maybe all the Dhavie and Nate stuff is making him reconsider some things ....which is why he’s looking for an explanation from James now instead of just shouting things to the wind as he usually does."
3464,2020-05-02 23:27:48,gcfj6o,Does she have any favorite special treats? Like a cake from a certain bakery or some kind of candy? Do you think the kids would want to do some art for her? Does she drink coffee/tea? You could have the kids each hold their hand on the cup in a different color [maybe the 8 year old around the handle and then the 6 and 3 year old could each make a hand print on the side] and then clear coat the outside to preserve their handprints on the mug.
3465,2020-05-02 23:31:44,gcfj6o,"First of all, congratulations on your marriage!

How about making a wellness package and add the soap you bought? A nice body scrub, some face masks, a good cleanser, parfume, bodylotion, hair masks, some of her favourite tea and a bath/shower bomb. 

And you were talking about make up and palletes, maybe a good set of make up brushes and lipstick? I have no idea if she already has enough of those. A bag for her to store her make up in or an organizer?

And for the stress thing, you could learn how to do a simple massage on YouTube, grab some oil from the kitchen (i think olive will work) and spoil her a bit after the dinner you made her (if you both are comfortable with that idea of course)"

What you are describing sounds like emotional abuse and a toxic home environment, and I am so so sorry you are going through this :( You have much courage for reaching out and sharing. Thank you for posting! You are not alone. We hear you. We see you. You are important! 

What ways do you cope during quarantine? It would be so hard to cope in that house, but I am wondering if you might be able to find some time in a space alone in your home for soothing yourself ♥️ Do you have a stuffed animal or fluffy pillow you could squeeze? Maybe you could watch a really happy movie and wrap up in a blankie with hot chocolate or maybe tea? I know it won't fix the situation, but it might help make it more tolerable! (: Can you think of anything you might be able to do tonight to be kind to yourself? 

Here is a list of soothing activities that might be helpful if you want inspiration! http://edencounseling.com/resources/dbt_distress_tolerance_group_5_handouts.pdf 

Also, are you physically safe? If at any point you do not feel safe please, please call 911 and/or Children's protective services ( https://www.childhelp.org/hotline/ ).

3499,2020-05-02 08:32:39,gbxfny,"That's terrible that your dad doesn't understand the impact of words. Lockdown has been stressful for everyone and your parents don't understand that they're taking out those frustrations on you. Do you have friends that you can facetime or snapchat with? I know that school is closed but having friends from school that you can talk to online and remember that they still exist would be good.

You aren't being a sensitive little bitch. Those are your parents's words but it does not make them true. There are differences about you that your parents don't understand yet. They might eventually once they understand that these differences aren't that big of a deal, we gay and transgender people aren't that different from anyone else, and that how we talk to each other does matter. It sounds like your parents have problems in how they talk to each other. As a kid and not a parent, it is not your responsibility to fix their relationship for them. It is also definitely not your fault no matter what they ever say. I've been there and have been blamed for my parents' fighting but their problems are not your fault.

It sounds like your mom and your dad are having significant problems with this quarantine thing. Do you have a church to which your family belongs? I'm asking because some churches have set up online services and web services for online family counseling. While it may not be a good idea to reach out to church people about being gay and trans, it may be a good idea to reach out to church elders about your parents fighting, your mom telling you that she wishes she never had you (my dad did that before, it took me years to forgive him and I do not speak to him anymore), and that your parents are having problems during quarantine and that they need help. If church is not an option, do you have online access to healthcare services? Some families let their kids message doctors, reup on their prescriptions, and other things like that. Online therapy has become immensely popular lately and online family therapy is an option. A family therapist would be interested in speaking to your parents about how they're dealing with quarantine and how, as a family, you can all reduce stress during this trying time.

I know that's a lot of ifs but online services have expanded quite a bit lately and if you can get access, it could be very helpful in getting your parents to calm down. Being gay and trans is hard WITHOUT a pandemic outside. More power to you and may the patience of a thousand dogs with treats on their noses be yours."

3586,2020-05-01 00:12:17,gb5s32,"I think it’s an obsession at this point. He goes through odd phases where he worships a “friend” for a while. He did this with Brittany Louis Taylor, Shanna, Amy Castle, Trish and now J*"
3587,2020-05-02 22:18:23,gb5s32,"Ehhh I don't think so. I don't think Shane and Jeffree are even good friends in real life. The friendship is played up for the camera, and Shane knows what story arcs and plot lines he has created for the viewers to see. We have seen him become ""good friends"" with Jeffree so to keep up the gag he mentions him a lot, to make us think they are friends. It is just a continuation of the previous plot points from the series. He wants us to think the friendship is better than it is."
3588,2020-05-07 06:49:36,gb5s32,yes. exactly.
3589,2020-05-04 16:38:06,gb5s32,"It’s something super dumb and people made a huge deal out of it,she apologised immediately when she realised she was wrong. Honestly Bunny might be one of the very few big YouTubers with almost zero drama/controversy and she seems pretty genuine and into her fans and what she presents to them."
3590,2020-04-30 22:53:42,gb5s32,That whole Starbucks thing that happened where her audience was saying that she was entitled
3591,2020-04-30 23:30:48,gb5s32,There is none Op it trying to cause drama.
3592,2020-05-03 04:31:40,gb5s32,I can’t believe I missed this. I usually remember the podcasts in great detail
3593,2020-04-30 22:52:56,gb5s32,That’s super interesting to think about.
3594,2020-05-01 14:59:02,gb5s32,"While I agree that GYG isn't nearly as bad as the others of this list, she has had her fair share of controversies beyond jus that dumb Starbucks comment.  There's stuff from her OG days that a lot of people have forgotten about (including her posing on graves).  Though in the grand scheme of trash, she is much lower on the list."
3595,2020-04-30 23:49:00,gb5s32,I also said associated with in the past
3596,2020-05-01 14:34:27,gb5s32,"He doesn’t, and he has actively disassociated himself with onion boy for a long time now. This post is a huuuuuuge reach."
3597,2020-05-01 00:14:17,gb5s32,Gigi has been extremely culturally ignorant in the past from what I remember. And yeah I agree the controversy ranges but it just makes my point because he’s talked about these people aside from videos
3598,2020-05-06 01:33:28,gb5s32,"I don't think she's malicious or ignorant in any way though. She's sweet, and suffers. He may have exploited her a bit, but I can't possibly bring myself to calling her problematic."
3599,2020-05-01 16:02:01,gb5s32,Colleen Ballinger is one of the most problematic on that list.

3601,2020-05-01 17:39:25,gb5s32,">You know this probably has nothing to do with it, but is it odd to anyone else that these are all white people?

I feel like that's just a reflection the YouTube community overall.

How many super popular YouTubers are POC?

The only non-white YouTubers I know are the mukbang people (Edit to add) and Safiya/Tyler."
3602,2020-05-02 06:10:52,gb5s32,"Yes!!! I have thought the same thing so many times. He CONTROLS what we see of course, so if we go by what he wants us to see, every person he associates with is white. Maybe he is racist or maybe he just unintentionally lands in white-bread neighborhoods or maybe it’s the crowd he runs with or maybe he doesn’t care or maybe or maybe or maybe  . . . but he’s under no obligation to convince his viewers of anything. I am glad you made the point though."
3603,2020-05-01 02:03:17,gb5s32,"Yeah, it was a thing blown out of proportion. She realized her mistake, iirc. I wouldn’t put her on the same list as Jeffree, Trish, Gabbie and apparently Colleen now."
3604,2020-05-01 04:33:30,gb5s32,oh grow up
3605,2020-05-04 01:16:13,gb5s32,"actually not a podcast, it was a video my bad: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POglYNFqYz8&feature=emb_title 

he talks about her at 3:45"
3606,2020-04-30 23:12:58,gb5s32,Specially with the first two. Not only is around them but supports them. J* is out there calling James a predator again with no proof and Trisha continues to be trash for clicks.
3607,2020-05-01 15:04:48,gb5s32,"I haven't forgotten, but she wasn't hanging out in cemeteries to be disrespectful. She hasn't done that in so long though, also, I know some of her problematic issues are purchasing clothes from problematic companies, but that's because she's not the brightest, but to add her in with people like, Tana, Trish and J\* when all She's done is one collab and never seems to talk, hang out, or mentions Shane is a bit of a reach."
3608,2020-05-02 21:48:34,gb5s32,">In the grand scheme of trash

Really though? Are you so quick to deal out what kind of people are trash? Posing on a graveyard? Yeah, maybe it's not the most couth thing in the world, but that doesn't make someone trash. 

I think you should reexamine your definition for ""trash human"" because I'm sure you and everyone else will be on there too. Ever yelled at your parents? Or spoke about someone disrespectfully or behind their back? That warrants a trash tag much more than posing on a graveyard.

If we were able to watch your life, I wonder what kind of things we would learn about you."
3609,2020-05-01 18:26:45,gb5s32,Yeah thats true. I know a few POC youtubers that deserve the spotlight more than Jake Paul and Tana Mogeau.
3610,2020-05-02 05:10:20,gb5s32,"... Umm. Some of the biggest YouTubers weren’t white? Lilly Singh, Brandon Rogers, Todrick Hall, Eugene from the Try Guys is still huge too, etc."

My point is the vast majority of extremely popular American YouTubers are white, therefore that's probably why Shane seemingly ""only hangs out/collabs with white people."""
3612,2020-05-02 07:31:22,gb5s32,"But to say stuff like you can’t even think of anyone? Come on, you’d have to basically be trying not to."

3619,2020-04-30 11:25:25,garzyw,"I think Shane loves gossip and drama, and he’s likes being “in the know” and gets easily sucked into shit. He’s way too old for it but he’s surrounded himself with all of these people who attract/incite drama. It all got out of hand and only then did he try to distance. The problem is that Shane seems to love being in the loop and wants to know everything/get involved but then when it gets heavy he complains about being in the middle of it and people coming to him and act like he’s above it all. I have zero doubt that they all got together and were trashing James but then Jeffree does what he always does and which Shane ought to know by now - he escalated it times ten and tried to drag everyone else in it with him so he wouldn’t be out on that limb alone. None of these people think like adults, or behave like adults, and surprise surprise shit hit the fan. 

The thing is, Shane isn’t a teenager. And he isn’t brand new to these people and what they’re like. He chooses to be involved with them and enjoys being on the inside and then when it gets truly ugly he tries to act like he’s the only mature one and wasn’t a part of or enjoying the drama before it got out of hand. Which, maybe that’s the case - but the maturity bar is pretty low with the bunch so that’s not saying a whole lot. The thing that pisses me off in regard to Shane, was his rant about everybody needing to stfu. He included James in that, and he shouldn’t have. James was full-on *attacked*, by the whole of the internet. James didn’t need to “stfu”. *They* all dragged it into public, not James. To expect a 19yo who was having his life utterly destroyed by a bunch of lying self absorbed assholes and he had every right to defend himself and make his own response to it all. All things considered, it’s pretty admirable that James only put out the videos that he did. Out of all these 30-somethings, the 19yo was the most mature of the bunch. Shanes tirade should’ve only been directed at his troublemaking friends - Jeffree and Tati. They started it, escalated it enormously. All James did was defend himself."
3620,2020-04-30 09:21:30,garzyw,"Just the fact that all three of them (Shane, Tati, Jeffree) were adults going after a teen and then when all those heavy accusations were proven to be false made me lose interest and not support Shane anymore. Shane tried to throw it off in his docu series claiming everyone moved on but that was proven not to be true in different interviews james did where that whole thing really had a toll in his mental health. It gave me a different perspective on who Shane is as a person and made me stop watching his entire inner circle."
3621,2020-04-30 13:02:11,garzyw,[removed]
3622,2020-04-30 20:21:28,garzyw,I want to know the reason why they are no longer friends with Tati. Especially now since Jeffree is placing all of Dramagedan 2 on Tati. He sure had  a lot to say but said nothing at all. Smoke n Mirrors. Makes you wonder if Jeffree was the mastermind behind Dramagedan 2 and enticed Tati to come out publicly.
3623,2020-04-30 13:09:56,garzyw,"Like you said, either Jeffree lied about Shane and threw him under the bus or he didn’t lie and Shane had been gossiping about James, a literal teenager at the time, to Jeffree. 

Honestly, even though Shane has found himself on the outskirts of the Dramageddon, he’s still found himself involved in some way or another and I’m finding it harder and harder to want to support him. Him being so close with Jeffree and Trisha is the main thing that is going to turn a good amount of his fans away. 

The Dahvie Vanity case plus Trisha causing someone with a severe mental illness to try and kill themselves isn’t exactly good PR to have around your name. Just having those types of people around you really does make people start to question your integrity and morals."
3624,2020-04-30 16:48:17,garzyw,[deleted]
3625,2020-04-30 13:10:23,garzyw,"I think shane hears a lot of gossip and shade about youtubers, so he prolly had some dirt on james, whether it was true or not \*shrugs\* , shane knows a lot more tea than he lets on in videos."
3626,2020-05-11 20:20:49,garzyw,"This might be an unpopular opinion but I was just disappointed Shane immediately took Jeffree and Tati’s side. Sure, the entire world did too at first but shane also knew james charles personally. They’ve done collabs together and has been to his home. He should’ve stayed out of it and now, I can’t believe he let jeffree take him down with him."
3627,2020-04-30 11:33:11,garzyw,It’s just Jeffree lying as usual
3628,2020-04-30 18:37:15,garzyw,"Probably A LOT less than what Jeffree implies. I think shane just thought james had a big ego. Jeffree claims that Shane said all this stuff about James trash talking. I highly doubt that. James is just obsessed with talking about money and stats.  Shane has just let Jeffree take over his whole public persona. So, he wasn’t going to publicly say anything against Jeffree. I don’t think james believes Shane had much to do with it. Jeffree is just trying to attach Shane to everything."
3629,2020-04-30 21:43:34,garzyw,His role was being complicit and indirectly co-signing Jeffree’s behavior. And hyping it up with that false advertisement he called a docu-trailer.
3630,2020-05-10 05:22:11,garzyw,He publicly supported Tati during the scandal which made all his fans think James was in the wrong. Shane still can’t take accountability for what he did to contribute to that
3631,2020-05-01 09:27:11,garzyw,"I just wish that he didn’t have to associate with Jeffree. The fact that Jeffree had to mention Shane’s name in the video multiple times to have the audience in his favor was really sick because I don’t see Shane as an Independent creator anymore and instead I see him as Jeffree’s puppet.

Even if you watch the comments on the drama channels of the Dahvie and Jeffree Star drama, all of his fans defended him like they were in some sort of cult. 

Also It’s clear that Jeffree is bribing Shane, I mean the expensive gifts he gives to Shane almost seems like he’s grooming him."
3632,2020-05-01 20:31:26,garzyw,"I’ve been thinking the exact same thing, it’s what made me look at Shane a little differently after watching him since the beginning"
3633,2020-05-01 00:03:05,garzyw,Where can I find this podcast?
3634,2020-04-30 11:48:30,garzyw,"You said yourself that if anything did happen it was behind the scenes and stuff we don’t know, so as far as what we know Shane didn’t have a role in the attack against James Charles. Obviously he knew about it because the entire world knew about it, and I’m sure him and Jeffree talked to each other about it since they were spending a lot of time together during that period. But, unless actual evidence comes out to prove otherwise grabbing pitchforks over this is pretty silly.

Edit; also, I highly doubt Shane said anything to Jeffree about James in regards to that text. It sounds like Jeffree being a prick and pulling shit out of his ass, per usual."
3635,2020-05-01 04:01:30,garzyw,Why do we care so much about stupid shit.....
3636,2020-04-30 13:13:55,garzyw,"james is doing well? all i see is ppl making fun of him, but that might be just the quality of ppl i follow, don't like james, he seemed off, and with how rude and mean he has been in the videos ive seen with him and shane, i cant."
3637,2020-04-30 12:15:01,garzyw,[deleted]
3638,2020-04-30 13:15:46,garzyw,"> He’s way too old for it 

I'm sorry, how old are you that you think that? Sincerely curious. Cause the most gossipy dramatic people I know are old biddies, so I don't think 30 is 'way too old' to be gossipy lol I swear some people get more gossipy and dramatic as they age."
3639,2020-05-07 08:45:13,garzyw,[deleted]
3640,2020-05-01 03:57:27,garzyw,"I would never support that racist, and Shane is just as racist too. Don't support either of them, to think I kinda used to is horrendous. I only watched them because they were popular. I have 0 interest in makeup, lying, shady, and racist people. I'm honestly ashamed I was even a sub, especially as a black person."
3641,2020-04-30 14:08:30,garzyw,Wow I never thought of it that way- good point
3642,2020-05-01 01:50:44,garzyw,"By the end, Tati seemed pissed but dropped the whole issue entirely. Shane still tweeted at Tati July 2019. But seem to have deleted his support of Tati during Dramagedon 2. 

From watching Ryland, they seem to still like her. They might have had a falling out after ""No More Lies"" but I also feel it's because Tati went with Seed Beauty for her makeup line. Seed Beauty does Kylie's products, and if you remember, Shane and Jeffree did a video to tank Kylie Skin. Plus the fact Tati Beauty was launched so close to Shane's palette."
3643,2020-05-01 04:24:14,garzyw,"Also, what was up with Shane trying to link up with Jake? That was seriously bizarre. If Jake paid him to do it, I would be believe it, but as another commenter said, Shane seems to love to associate himself with people are problematic and in lots of drama, because he himself loves the drama.  When you think about, Shane always seem to be friends, or try to be, with problematic people who get posted about all the time because of drama and stupid stuff. He's friends with a lot of popular youtubers also. It's like he uses them for fame and attention. Doesn't seem far honestly. Does Shane think he's some kind of ""angel"" or something, that thinking being friends, with him will make people good. He wasn't wrong though, but those people are only good for the camera, on the inside and behind the scenes, they aren't. Sorry for my terrible grammar."
3644,2020-04-30 14:39:13,garzyw,"A bit off topic, but do you really think DissociaDID situation can be held against Trisha? Since when is anyone responsible for the mental health of others? Not excusing Trisha at all, but she is a well known troll whose words should never be taken seriously. Nin’s mental health is her own business, and if Trisha saying that she found Nin “a little crazy” is urging her to kill herself, then I don’t think this person should be on the internet.

Again, just to reiterate, I think Trisha is a highly problematic person and I am not excusing her actions, but do you really think that’s on the same level as Jeffree standing by as someone abused children?"
3645,2020-05-01 01:55:32,garzyw,"That was actually a main point why people said it was all a ploy to take down competition and sell vitamins. Shane's promotion of Halo Beauty felt like it came out of nowhere. 

I didn't want to believe it then because it sounds like a conspiracy but now looking back, I'm second guessing everything now."
3646,2020-04-30 17:58:15,garzyw,"He tried to say “drama aside I really do like these magic beans!!”. First of all, saying drama aside especially during a scandal that blew up the way it did was definitely wanting to invite more drama. He could have just told Tati privately that he enjoyed her product, or just shut up."
3647,2020-05-16 11:51:44,garzyw,That's what I think too. I think it's possible that Jeffree was just trying to make Shane seem much more involved than he actually was just to make himself look less problematic.
3648,2020-05-02 22:58:40,garzyw,Spotify
3649,2020-04-30 23:26:23,garzyw,He surpassed Jeffree in subs again so I think Jeffree inserted that bit about the alleged victim in there to disrupt that.
3650,2020-04-30 13:14:39,garzyw,"I agree with most of what you said, but I really don’t think Shane needs to be “cancelled” - I don’t think any of these people are even cancellable. If that were they case, they would’ve been already. Instead, I think it’ll just be a gradual decline that will take years, as they get even older and others rise up and take their place. I don’t want Shane to be cancelled, I just wish he’d make better choices - and I’ll continue to be vocal with criticism where I think it’s warranted. 

I think an issue that gets conflated is that people think holding someone accountable equals trying to cancel them. Some people do try to permanently cancel people over everything, but people are allowed to take issue with things and there are very valid issues people have with some of these peoples actions, and holding them responsible and not just excusing it without the person acknowledging what they did wrong doesn’t equal cancelling. It’s gotten to where some people have the attitude that because some people are too quick to want/try to cancel people, that means people shouldn’t have to take responsibility or acknowledge wrongdoing at all bc “psshh cancel culture” and everything should just be excused. Those are two extremes and neither one is good. People are beginning to use toxic cancel culture as an excuse to never be held accountable or to absolve others even when the person won’t even acknowledge they did anything wrong."
3651,2020-04-30 13:34:22,garzyw,But do regular 30 year olds actively try to destroy the career and reputation of a 19 year old? Just checking
3652,2020-04-30 13:27:33,garzyw,"Anybody that has worked in an office environment knows that nobody is too old for gossip. Pretty much everyone gossips. Old white women especially, that seems like it’s their only form of entertainment sometimes."
3653,2020-04-30 13:16:29,garzyw,I’m 37.
3654,2020-05-01 20:01:02,garzyw,Those old bidies are immature too. Shane is too old to be gossiping about whether or not someone is a predator.
3655,2020-05-07 09:17:12,garzyw,Exactly!!
3656,2020-05-01 06:20:14,garzyw,"I can see why she went with a different company. I own a few of JS plattes. I have tried everything to get them to have color payoff and nothing it just either turns muddy when blended out or won't blend out. I've even wetted the brush. My bank account hurts right now because I decided that maybe it was because I didn't have the right eyeshadow primer or eye brushes. I've purchased a range from drug store to designer eyeshadow primers non have worked. Also a wide range of natural fiber and synthetic fiber eyeshadow brushes from different brands. I'm on my last straw and if the nyx clay primer doesn't work and the morphe brushes don't either I'll never purchase from JSC ever again. Don't know if it's cause I received dud palettes or this is just how it is. I have zero issues with my highly pigmented drug store or Spoiled Cosmetic eyeshadows. If Spoiled Cosmetics an MLM I don't support it or spend money on it. My stepmother love's the makeup (I've warned her, just speaking to a wall) she just has so many doubles that she gifts them to people. I'm not one to waste products and have researched the ingredients (not vegan though) there isn't asbestos or things that can cause harm to ones health so I'll use it until it expires or I hit pan."
3657,2020-04-30 18:41:23,garzyw,Trisha is pretending to have DID...it goes way beyond calling someone a little crazy.
3658,2020-05-02 22:24:31,garzyw,"Exactly. It cannot and should not. Trisha is a known troll who says the most ridiculous things for views and money. She has come out as a chicken nugget, as black, as a lesbian, as a gay man, as a trans person, etc. Anyone who gave Trisha attention over the DID thing did exactly what she wanted. This was all under her comedy channel, where she plays a new person every video. If people know this about her, why watch the video? You know she is going to be offensive. And she didn't even say things that were *that* bad."
3659,2020-05-01 04:09:01,garzyw,"Jeffree literally told he was gonna throw acid on black women, and went into town and called people niggers, also the pedo incident.  If anything he's worst, the fact that you're questioning that. It doesn't even matter who did what worse. Stop comparing, they're both shitty, trashy, disgusting people. Trying to question who did worse is the dumbest thing ever. If I could do the facepalm emoji, I would."
3660,2020-04-30 14:59:25,garzyw,"I agree 100%. Nin literally runs a mental health channel where she's actively portraying herself as dozens of different people every day, with new characters being introduced often. Nobody told her to put her mental health struggles on the internet and she cant possible expect to not get negative feedback like every other creator."
3661,2020-05-03 06:10:52,garzyw,Thanks! I still haven’t listened bc I can’t find it.
3662,2020-05-01 03:47:06,garzyw,"So being racist isn't cancelable. You sound like one of those people to not give a fuck when something is not affecting them badly, but another group. Wasn't Jeffree also outed for being friends with a pedophile and doing things with underage girls ,and he didn't care about. You reek of ignorance. Using the term cancelled itself is stupid. Just speaks toxic and ignorant. They're all terrible people, and should all be outed for it. It sounds like you sill support Shane, even though he's some big huge clown, along with his circus friends"
3663,2020-05-01 00:05:11,garzyw,"The thing is those 30 year olds and 19 year olds turned their public image into a business. At that point, you can't complain about the business being attacked like that, it's going to happen and there's no way to avoid it. The job is to manage the attacks to the brand and play the game. This isn't gossip and drama - it's just old school competitive business. They all get involved in it because they know it's got a good chance of leading to profit. Sometimes they're lucky like JS and Shane, and the drama leads to profit, sometimes they're unlucky like James and it doesn't. At the end of the day, the drama is a product that the audience continues to buy in one way or another."
3664,2020-04-30 13:40:26,garzyw,"Nope, and I didn't say shit about that I'm directly addressing the concept of people over 30 not gossiping, so move along"
3665,2020-04-30 13:39:32,garzyw,Old men can gossip something fierce too! It's sincerely ridiculous to think people stop gossiping over a certain age
3666,2020-04-30 13:33:40,garzyw,Nobody is too old to be capable of it. The people who continually get sucked into other peoples drama into their 30’s should’ve matured more by then and learned lessons. “People do it” doesn’t mean it’s right or not immature.
3667,2020-05-01 20:01:59,garzyw,Doesn’t make it right and speaks to those peoples’ immaturity. That makes Shane immature too. Regular people do not engage in that sort of behavior.
3668,2020-04-30 13:19:20,garzyw, and you actually think 30 is 'way too old' to be gossipy? lol okay
3669,2020-05-01 11:07:10,garzyw,"I only have Tati's palette. Very satisfied with my purchase, the colors are basic but the quality is good. I use it every time. 

Never bought JSC makeup so idk how it compares. I also feel its too expensive? I might as well save a lil bit to buy MAC or Natasha Denona products."
3670,2020-04-30 15:08:07,garzyw,"Exactly. I will keep my opinions on Nin to myself, but I will say that if you choose to have an online presence largely based on your very rare disorder that a lot of people don’t even believe exists, you have to be ready to face negative reactions to your content."
3671,2020-05-01 11:09:17,garzyw,"You’ve gotten all up in arms over misunderstanding what I meant by that, which I can understand the feeling but it’s unnecessary, and all of your hurled insults are unwarranted. I don’t think you even read my second paragraph, given 

> Using the term cancelled itself is stupid. Just speaks toxic and ignorant. They're all terrible people, and should all be outed for it.

 No, I don’t think Shane should be cancelled - I don’t think he’s a racist or a pedo or anything like that. But as for Jeffree, Tana, and Trisha - I wasn’t saying that any of those people just deserve to stay relevant or keep their platforms. My point was that given the longstanding pattern of offenses by all of them, and that they haven’t been cancelled yet, I don’t think they ever will be. My personal opinion of all of them has nothing to do with that observation. 

Yes, I still like and watch Shane. I’m also critical of him when I take issue with something, and have been pretty vocal about that repeatedly on this sub. I am a staunch advocate for this place not turning into a fan page - it’s for all Shane Dawson discussion, good or bad. But what this sub *isn’t*, is a place for you to come and insult other commenters here with wild unwarranted accusations. And it might benefit you to consider that the way to get others to see your point of view or get on board with a position of yours, isn’t to just insult them. But maybe you don’t really care about the heart of any of these issues - maybe you just enjoy going on the internet and typing out your outrage and insulting people."
3672,2020-04-30 13:47:37,garzyw,"Good thing I never suggested that, then. People doing a thing beyond a certain age doesn’t mean they’re not immature for doing it. I never once suggested that everyone over a certain age just stops doing a thing. Not sure why you decided to project that onto my comment, but whatever."
3673,2020-04-30 13:56:40,garzyw,"I’m sorry, I don’t think gossiping amongst friends is a horrible thing to do. In fact it’s a pretty natural thing to do. It’s only when you hurt other people and drag them into it that it’s not right, and again, there is no proof that Shane did that so your argument is invalid."
3674,2020-05-01 22:33:34,garzyw,"Do not engage in what, gossip? Because that’s just blatantly untrue. In my 30 years of experience in both school, the work force and every day life, almost everyone I’ve spent any significant amount of time around gossips. It is a very natural thing to do, as much as you want to insist it isn’t."
3675,2020-04-30 13:29:58,garzyw,"I think they mean that it's way too old for them to be publicly gossiping (or at least spreading what they know subtlely on twitter and the like) about someone much younger than them. When you are a public figure, you've got to try and keep your record clean (even if you're not good behind the scenes), and this group isn't doing a very good job of it."
3676,2020-04-30 13:28:04,garzyw,"Yes. Just because some people do it, doesn’t make it right, and isn’t an excuse. You’re fine with it, great. It’s still immature. Being in your 30’s and not having learned to not get sucked into other peoples drama is silly. It’s way too old to not have learned how to avoid that. Immaturity isn’t a virtue."
3677,2020-04-30 15:33:42,garzyw,"I believe it exists after very massive forms of intense trauma. Survivors of satanic ritual abuse where they watch others be tortured/murdered, sure.

3684,2020-04-30 13:38:08,garzyw,I never said I was fine with it. But what's really silly is to act like older people don't gossip at all. What's silly is to expect someone who has shown nothing but immaturity to suddenly start acting mature lol.
3685,2020-04-30 15:48:53,garzyw,"It’s not rare at all. My brother has DID. He wasn’t a survivor of a satanic cult. He was emotionally abused as a child.

Should she expect to get negative abuse because of her situation? Yes. Should she have to? No. Should Trisha or anyone target or mock someone who’s mentally unwell? Fuck no. 

I think the Jeffree situation is a much bigger deal than the Trisha one but because of her scandals being very public on her own channel versus Jeffrees being pretty old now and him having a lot more power, it’s going to take a bit more to get him to tumble.

And it needs to happen because he’s not holding himself accountable for anything. He constantly placed the blame on others. On Tati, on James, on Nathan, Manny, Laura etc and he’s done it since forever. He placed the blame on the fans and mothers in the Chris Hanson livestream. He placed part of the blame on Jay. He always gets away with stuff with the same old spiel of “things were different back then, I’d like to think I’ve grown” etc etc. He hasn’t. 

And no one else around him is holding him accountable either because he surrounds himself with yes people."

3687,2020-04-30 13:52:19,garzyw,"Are you deliberately *trying* to ignore the context? Or just bad at reading comprehension? The quote you just put of mine directly contradicts you saying that I claimed people over a certain age don’t “gossip”. You seem super defensive about immaturity, not sure why."
3688,2020-04-30 14:53:18,garzyw,"Do you not understand how conversations work? I am responding to something you said, which was about Shane being too old to gossip. You said that. I am commenting on it. Now you are trying to backtrack because people have pointed out the stupidity of that particular comment. I didn’t mention the rest of what you said because that isn’t what I am commenting on. But keep blaming it on reading comprehension :)  Clearly you’re one of those people that can’t handle criticism like you accuse Shane of so any further discourse with you is pointless. Try not to be so stressed over what youtubers are doing and have a lovely day."
3689,2020-05-01 22:42:16,garzyw,"Ahhh, yeah, sorry, I guess we will have to agree to disagree. Gossiping is a natural and normal thing to do, especially among friends, and as long as it doesn’t lead to hurting someone it’s not a terrible thing."
3690,2020-04-30 13:43:09,garzyw,I agree with you as well. I don't know if this person meant this but it's what I got from it. The most horrible gossips in my town are all middle aged/older people.
3691,2020-04-30 13:44:20,garzyw,">act like older people don’t gossip at all

I didn’t act like that, you’re projecting things onto my comments that just aren’t there. Idk why you decided to hone in on the word “gossip”, my comment about him being too old was in regard to getting sucked into other peoples drama anyway. And again, just because people do it doesn’t mean they aren’t too old to not have matured more or learned lessons. 

>I never said I was fine with it 

Then why take issue with me having an opinion about it? You seem pretty pressed about me disliking something you’re “not fine” with also."
3692,2020-05-02 07:15:53,garzyw,We don’t have to forgive him for that; he isn’t owed it but how do those gucci slides taste? Probably not great since Shane doesn’t bathe.
3693,2020-05-01 22:42:55,garzyw,"We will but in this instance, but Shane’s gossiping was not harmless and depending on the context in a work environment, it can also be harmful there, as well."
3694,2020-04-30 13:49:45,garzyw,That person is asserting that I said something my comment doesn’t say. I never said anyone over a certain age doesn’t gossip. They have become super defensive over a single word in my comment and have misrepresented what I said.
3695,2020-04-30 13:46:53,garzyw,">I think Shane loves gossip and drama, and he’s likes being “in the know” and gets easily sucked into shit. **He’s way too old for it** 

you *literally said it* my dude, but okay.     


>You seem pretty pressed about me disliking something you’re “not fine” with also.

No, I'm bothered by you acting like it doesn't happen, not by you disliking it. I think what I'm saying is pretty darn clear. I never said shit about being fine with it or approving of gossip, that's *you* projecting things on to *my* comments dear."
3696,2020-04-30 13:58:06,garzyw,"You are incredibly poor at reading comprehension. I never acted like it doesn’t happen. Never even hinted that it doesn’t. And I didn’t isolate it to “gossip”, I included also getting sucked into other peoples drama, too. I made a personal judgement on it being immature and him being too old for it. Anybody in their 30s who relish in gossip and get repeatedly sucked into drama is immature, and they are too old to not have learned lessons. That doesn’t mean people don’t do it. It means it’s silly and immature and they shouldn’t. But go ahead, dig in."
3697,2020-04-30 03:18:41,gam5jv,"I feel like we are due for something big coming around the corner. What with Jeffree’s recent interviews and latest goading towards James Charles and in my opinion his use of Shane’s name like he’s a shield, I fell like he’s pulling up this carpet to air some unfinished business. Now that Nathan is out of the picture and Shane is there instead I feel like he just upgraded in deflection tactics. It is yet to be know if Jeffree intentions are good or mischievous, if he intends to try to be friends with James or if he’s just feeling some type of way since  Nathan left him and he is no longer friends with Tati, isolating Jeffree’s feelings and after thoughts towards dramageddon."
3698,2020-04-30 11:25:56,gam5jv,The card reader Aphrodite predicted all this on J\*.  Of course he also said Jeffree would come out of the situation a better person and would get through it without much damage if he handled it correctly.   The key is if he handles it correctly.  I think he's talking too much right now and needs to reel it back in.  Guess I should have read the comments below.  I'm going to leave mine in anyway.
3699,2020-04-30 20:11:23,gam5jv,This may be me showing my age (and my emo roots) but Jeffree Star has been messy since his Myspace days. So many people excuse some of his older behavior by saying it was a different time....it was 2008 not 1938. Even back in the 90s and 2000s we knew what was ok and what wasn't. I have a lipgloss from the Blood Lust collection and it's fine. But a good lipgloss is not a good enough reason for me to overlook some of the things he's done and is continuing to do. I will however be watching Peter's videos as this all goes down with great interest!
3700,2020-05-02 16:04:37,gam5jv,"Jeffree  is going to get hard this time. And you know Tati, Manny, Laura, JC, KVD ectra are all watching intently"
3701,2020-04-30 07:59:29,gam5jv,"I'm here for it. I've never been a J* fan, but I enjoy most of his YouTube content; mindless entertainment for me. As far as his cosmetics, I have a few palettes and enjoy half of them (Blood Sugar and Alien are great, imo. Mini Controversy is ok. Conspiracy is a flop...I said it.) Will I purchase anymore from his line? Probably not. Am I here for the drama? Of course. Peter going in on him in the latest video was exactly what I needed to start my day. J* seems to think he's never going to be knocked off his throne, but the time is coming."
3702,2020-06-21 17:21:51,gam5jv,This has aged well.
3703,2020-04-30 04:24:56,gam5jv,In Peter's latest video someone mentions go watch antprodite's YouTube scandal video from a month ago. Some of these things happening lately kinda line up with those predictions.  Pretty interesting if you're into tarot readers.
3704,2020-05-02 16:40:21,gam5jv,"Unpopular opinion, but Jeffree's music is awful. I've listened to some of it recently just to see what it was like and it was foul. Not only lyrically but the whole song."
3705,2020-04-30 04:26:37,gam5jv,"I actually really like antphrodite’s tarot readings, I forgot he made one for the next big scandal coming. I’ll definitely go check it out now and see how things are lining up."
3706,2020-05-02 17:06:42,gam5jv,I don’t think that’s an unpopular opinion outside of his own head. At no point will I ever claim that teenaged me had good musical taste. Thus the amount of time I spent on MySpace. A lot of the “singers” on there sounded like that.
3707,2020-05-02 16:40:58,gam5jv,I also have to say it - the man can't sing to save his life. Even with all that editing and autotune he sounds flat and lifeless.
3708,2020-05-02 17:11:33,gam5jv,"Hahaha, yes that was just the style. I was a big fan of  what you would now call prog metal as a teen, so o

3728,2020-04-29 09:47:03,ga5e48,"Hardly anything in the media is accurate and most of it lacks context.  I will say that at least in work situations with most companies in America and there being laws to protect people's sexual orientation it has helped immensely that ppl aren't getting abused at work for being gay for fear they will lose their jobs.  I have seen just from normal working ppl that they seem to accept gay ppl, it's not a huge deal for them as it could have been in the past.

With that said I never came out at work lol, I'm smart enough to know not to lets everyone know that I'm gay because yes there are still bigots out there's, ppl raised to hate gay ppl mostly from heavy religious backgrounds or just being uneducated that they can easily cause us harm and I try and avoid that at all costs.   Is that weak of me to do? probably but I don't care my safety comes first until the day that I know we're 100% safe for being gay then I'll gladly do so.

&#x200B;

I'm sure being gay at school is still tough but less tough then it was say in the 80-90s where if you were gay you were a walking joke that would get verbally picked on of course there were some exceptions but the ones that can't hide being gay usually had bad days and it sucked."
3729,2020-04-29 08:17:50,ga5e48,"Define ""media"". 

Because if you look in the right places, you'll see the things you're talking about are being shown and getting reported. 

If you're talking about *fictional* media, like television and movies, then yes they're presenting a happy view of LGBT life. Why would you make a sitcom that shows gay people getting abused? Why would you make a drama about transgender people getting murdered. Noone wants to watch that for entertainment. Entertainment is always going to be happier and more optimistic than reality. 

But *factual* media, like news, is still reporting the things you're talking about."
3730,2020-04-29 16:38:05,ga5e48,"99% might be a bit high re: straight men. Straight women are usually better but not always. The meanest, most homophobic person I've ever encountered was actually trans, so you never know who's going to be the worst to you!

Truth as far as I can see is that we really have come a LONG WAY. When I first came out 20 years ago, my boyfriend at the time and I had to really watch our backs and hope we didn't get caught by anyone. This was in the US, even. Contrast with my fiancé now, walking down the street in a small conservative town holding hands. Yeah, we got a lot of stares, but we were drunk so we didn't care. I know those would have been shouts and threats just a few years ago.

But we do have a very long way to go. People would get gay bashed in San Francisco of all places, at least back when I lived there not so long ago. We obviously have a hostile government now, too. That's scary enough for adults; I can only imagine what it was like for younger queer kids when 45 got installed."

It draws an important parallel which is why I think it has relevance to discuss. If you are willing to openly lie or not report a crime like what is alleged in BOTH cases, then in my opinion a person like that is complicit and garners no support from me."

I don't live with my nibling and their parents, though accepting and understanding aren't too involved with their children's lives. I don't think they have the time to discuss with them the issues and intricacies with these youtubers and manage 2 other children.


My problem with JS and JC is that they are openly problematic, unlike in my time, without social media, things (good and bad) were not as public.

I doubt he will ever recover from this because the racism alone is bad enough and then the way he dreamed of attacking that woman it literally made me feel sick to my stomach. As for the way he laughed about a baby being attacked and was getting himself off looking at a pic of a child... this man (or should I say thing) is a racist pedophile and deserves to be in jail. I’m sorry but if any general member of the public did what he did they would be arrested. 

I’m ashamed that I ever enjoyed his content, it just goes to show how fake he is and that he’s been wearing a mask... well the mask has slipped now. We can all see what a filthy and despicable person he is.  I’ve no idea why Ryland is sticking around because I’d have left."
3744,2020-06-26 17:13:41,hga3wk,I'm so glad other YouTube celebrities are calling them out and spreading awareness of how terrible their actions have been.
3745,2020-06-26 21:37:06,hga3wk,"Is it common for people with low confidence and self hate to act out and say ridiculous stuff? I've noticed that a lot. I really hope none of that is true. I dont care about makeup or merch, I just like Shanes content and probably always will but...mostly the squad/spooky boys stuff."
3746,2020-06-26 23:32:25,hga3wk,"I know I've said it a lot, but my issue with Shane (and Jeffree) is that it goes beyond ""some skits and tweets with racist undertones in the 00s. For example, when I look at Jenna Marbles, yes some of her skits were racially insensitive or other problematic things, but it wasn't as over the top and repeated pattern as Shane's and she took ownership for her past and all the responsibility and grew from it and truly showed it with her actions.

Whereas in Shane's case it goes beyond some skits and edgy teenager humor. His obsession with rape, behavior towards children and other over the top things that he did for years are simply not normal, even for.a edgy kid years ago. And though he stopped doing the messed up stuff, apologized for some and deleted lots of the problematic videos, it always gave me a vibe that he was mostly sorry for being called out, and that if he hadn't noticed that people were much more aware and critical of this stuff in the past few years, he wouldn't have changed his on camera behavior and would've kept on doing it. Also he has this tendency of making it about him when he apologizes instead of making it about the people that were hurt. I don't know, I just don't know where this ""Shane the empath"" comes from, because I don't see much empathy in him in general, even if he has toned down his problematic persona. I do think though when he was friends with Garrett and the others, he seemed to be in a better place and making good and fun content... he was suddenly likeable.

As to Jeffree, I could believe he was sorry for his behavior years ago and had changed if he would stop continuously showing he's an awful person. He might not say racist stuff on camera anymore, but his heart seems to be filled with hatred and toxicity, so it wouldn't surprise me if he hasn't fully changed on that aspect.

I'm not in favor of ""cancel culture"" as they like to victimize themselves about, but some things I just can't get by, and some people are simply not good people and don't seem to grow years after years and still get passes and excuses over and over again."

3749,2020-06-26 20:27:40,hga3wk,Loey is friends with Trisha Paytas too so Shane definitely knows who she is
3750,2020-06-26 22:17:58,hga3wk,Can we talk about the super creepy 18th birthday party he threw for Alexis G Zall years ago? I think it was on his podcast. It got pretty inappropriate and she looked incredibly uncomfortable the whole time.
3751,2020-06-26 23:23:30,hga3wk,What is this what happened I'm sorry out of the loop buy what did Shane do exactly?
3752,2020-06-26 17:25:55,hga3wk,"He hasn't done blackface/made racist jokes ever since he officially apologized in 2014. Are people not allowed to change after 6 YEARS?

3753,2020-06-26 20:59:57,hga3wk,What does she mean about inappropriate around children?
3754,2020-06-27 01:33:20,hga3wk,I have searched but I can't find an answer to this question. Can anyone explain to me what Shane did to and/or around children that is bad? I am trying to understand everything that is currently happening.
3755,2020-06-27 03:10:55,hga3wk,"Anytime I had extra money I wanted to buy their shit. Never did. Just something told me ""no."" Glad I didn't."
3756,2020-06-27 04:29:04,hga3wk,So what did I miss what’s going on i
3757,2020-06-27 04:35:32,hga3wk,Okay yeah but is not no one gonna talk about how Donald trump was just exposed for actually raping under age girls like wtf people there’s fucking evidence about this and nobody is doing anything I’m sorry I got off subject but it países me off
3758,2020-06-27 21:10:55,hga3wk,I wonder if Garrett is still friends with him
3759,2020-06-29 07:28:52,hga3wk,"FINALLY a youtuber who isn’t specifically a tea or commentary channel who has the balls to actually call it out specifically. Good for her, I imagine that’s still a pretty nerve wracking thing to post when you could easily say nothing but IT HAD TO BE SAID."
3760,2020-06-26 20:25:08,hga3wk,I know I’m late to the party but can someone pls explain real quick what happened? Thanks lol
3761,2020-06-26 20:20:12,hga3wk,Who made her Jesus Christ?
3762,2020-06-26 20:53:05,hga3wk,"I bought their mini palette a few months ago. I didn't know who they were but multiple people I knew kept telling me to buy it because it was good quality. I hadn't watched Shane Dawson but kind of knew of him, same with Jeffree Star. Just wasn't a big YouTube watcher and I'm interested in beauty really. It's literally the only eyeshadow product I own. I'll still use it but my god if I knew all this shit I never would've bought from them."
3763,2020-06-26 19:14:46,hga3wk,That’s so weird because she used to be/is married? Like what the hell happened to her husband? He just vanished of the face of the earth.
3764,2020-06-26 17:53:40,hga3wk,Randomly or does your husband have a large following?
3765,2020-06-26 19:37:27,hga3wk,I haven’t kept up with her but isn’t she married? Or have they divorced?
3766,2020-06-26 20:01:13,hga3wk,I thought she were married?

If so that’s heinous and I really dislike that behavior"
3770,2020-06-26 18:20:28,hga3wk,i love ryland but this is making me question him as well. what proves that i shouldn’t believe he isn’t the same way and just wears his mask very well?
3771,2020-06-26 21:27:25,hga3wk,"> the way he dreamed of attacking that woman it literally made me feel sick to my stomach. As for the way he laughed about a baby being attacked and was getting himself off looking at a pic of a child

What is this referring to? Where can I find the context for this?"
3772,2020-06-27 20:41:43,hga3wk,Does anyone know where to find shane talking about attacking a woman; I saw the thread about the predatory things he’s done like pretending to get off in front of a radio Disney poster with 11 yr old willow smith on it.
3773,2020-06-26 21:37:17,hga3wk,the way he dreamed of attacking what woman ??
3774,2020-06-26 21:58:05,hga3wk,Honestly people put on persona when they're on camera so who really knows how they are in private. Ryland is pretty rude and doesn't seem like the nicest person and Morgan and Shane have even said that about him. Shane admitted that what he liked about Ryland was that he wasn't nice to him and J and Trish are kind of the same as well in the way they treat people. He also said he was interested in the lives of the drama YouTubers and now he's in the middle of it.
3775,2020-06-26 21:50:14,hga3wk,"he openly admits his past he said and did things for shock value, and it shows, i mean my fav vid from the past was the 12 year old pregnant maury sketch, but they jokes he did on the podcast were way to dark, ive always liked shane, but he does need to take responsibility for his bad decisions and jokes"
3776,2020-06-26 19:20:43,hga3wk,"He called a child ""sexy"", googled child p\*rn, and talked about sex toys and sex positions with a twelve year old."
3777,2020-06-26 19:48:53,hga3wk,He also pretended to jerk off to a picture of underage Willow Smith
3778,2020-06-26 20:49:29,hga3wk,Is Loey still friends with Trisha because she’s (Trisha) problematic too and unapologetic about it.
3779,2020-06-26 17:45:36,hga3wk,"Nah, instead he went on to make fun of peoples beliefs and mental illness instead.

People aren't (well they shouldn't) still bashing him for blackface and the racist jokes, which he apologized for - they are bashing him for making up drama for the views, exploiting potential mental illness in people or when he shades people who believes in ghosts or in religion.

\- It's clear now, that him and Jeffree Star made up the James Charles case; most likely an experiment that Jeffree made so that Shane could experience how crazy the make-up world can be. It even caused James Charles to be suicidal (which he has said) and almost cancelled his career. I wonder how the fuck they would've reacted if James Charles had actually went through with off'ing himself. I bet'ya they would'nt do that stunt again - because rest assured, Jeffree Star has done this before.

\- Expoiting mental illness; if he didn't exploit Euginia Cooney, I don't know what he did. She has some-what relapsed and he's always like ""I love yooou, so cuuute"" on Twitter/Instagram when she does make-up.... related to him or Jeffree Star... other than that, radio silence. He even said in his video about her, that he wished that more people would take action when they see a friend in need. She's relapsed or is in the early stages of relapsing. I hope she gets the help she needs and deserves, because she truly seems like a genuine person. 

\- Religion; he has numerous times made fun of people believing in God (or any religion really). Not only that, but he were outright disrespectful when filming the videos with Bunny/Graveyardgirl - sure, you may not believe in ghosts, but it's still very disrespectful to use that persons beliefs to scare them (and yes, for someone who believes in the supernatural, a deep dark growl is considered to be dangerous and demonic) - him and Garrett orchestrated it. 

He might've been geniune once upon a time, but he has turned into a not-so-nice guy that thinks it's cute to advocate for bad hygiene."
3780,2020-06-26 18:33:31,hga3wk,"It's not just about the blackface.

He described in detail how he would torture a woman who called him out for being racist. He said he would rip her teeth out one by one, rip her fingernails out, bite her finger after ripping her nails out, pour drops of acid all over face and more fucked up things. This was in 2016.

Him and Lisa were demonstrating a sex act to a 12 year old and asked her to recreate it. 

When he was told that a 4 month old baby died after being raped, he laughed and asked ""how does that happen? Does the dick go up till [body part] of the baby?""

He also said ""if people can google feet pics, why can't they google naked baby pics and jack off to it?"""
3781,2020-06-26 17:43:46,hga3wk,"J\* has done racist shit in much more recent history, and Shane's been promoting him and giving him a platform. Also, the bullying of James Charles was a year ago."
3782,2020-06-26 17:52:24,hga3wk,"He wore his Shanaynay or whatever shirt in a 2018 video, the one where him and Ryland did James Charles makeup, and was profiting on it until J* took over his merchandise."
3783,2020-06-27 11:10:42,hga3wk,He is a PEDOPHILE
3784,2020-06-26 17:34:03,hga3wk,"Thats what gets me he already addressed this. I think he should be deleting these videos like he's been doing as well. 
Even if your ignoring that people still see shane as this bad guy thanks to j* imo. Ive heard people excusing tati because she was ""pressed"" to start the whole drama in the first place but then can't that be said for shane too? Shane probably just signed all these nondisclosures and has to keep his mouth shut and get dragged down which seems unacceptable. 

Shane shouldnt have to say anything about this racist shit again, because he already did."
3785,2020-06-26 18:39:12,hga3wk,Christ. Thank you. I wanted to comment this.
3786,2020-06-26 17:36:54,hga3wk,And he has already addressed the child scandal. He didn't/hasn't/will never do anything to a child! He is great around kids and one day he will be an amazing dad!
3787,2020-06-27 00:35:40,hga3wk,"Lots of posts on this thread, you'll see."

3791,2020-06-26 21:18:11,hga3wk,"She’s not married anymore. She refuses to admit it but she moved out and to Cali with her pets and never spoke of him again and started drinking heavily especially after her father passed. Totally changed up how she dressed and who she hung out with. Not for the positive .

I used to watch her but she seems really fake and all her friends she did have left because of something she did (yet they won’t elaborate) and her content is more seemingly for kids now and what isn’t I’m not interested in or someone does it better.

But I’m glad/proud she posted about it"

3793,2020-06-26 20:04:16,hga3wk,"Rylands most recent videos where SHane appears, he looks grossed out and tired of him."
3794,2020-06-26 20:21:43,hga3wk,"I don't like Ryland but I truly don't think Ryland is a creep. I remember noticing how weirded out and uncomfortable he was when Shane was talking about kissing their dog once. He also mentioned something once about how he was very uncomfortable with Shane's porn habits. I think he's aware of Shane's freaky interests, but I don't think he's into any of that himself - truly."
3795,2020-06-26 18:23:11,hga3wk,"That is yet to be seen. I’m seriously hoping that he comes to his senses and gets as far away from Shane as possible. 

For the moment I am still subscribed to Ryland and I still follow him on twitter etc.  But I don’t know how long for. I don’t know if I will carry on following him as by not leaving Shane he is supporting his behaviour."
3796,2020-06-26 21:19:35,hga3wk,Same. I can’t believe he Would have never looked into Shane’s past before dating him and he was there during dramageddon.
3797,2020-06-26 23:03:07,hga3wk,The first sentence is referring to a clip of him from his Shane and Friends podcast in which he details how specifically he would want to torture a woman who was calling him a racist. It gets really graphic and he goes into detail about it all.
3798,2020-06-27 20:43:29,hga3wk,I already posted a link yesterday. It will be on here somewhere.
3799,2020-06-26 21:48:44,hga3wk,"There is a tape of him on a podcast saying that he wanted to attack a woman because she called him a racist. It’s quite graphic. This is the only video I could find. Be prepared. It’s sick.  


https://youtu.be/wbMOeOEJOLo"
3800,2020-06-26 19:57:25,hga3wk,When did this happen? I feel like I’ve missed out on a lot
3801,2020-06-26 22:06:55,hga3wk,I'm not sure tbh. I just remembering her mentioning their friendship about a year and a half ago.
3802,2020-06-26 22:33:48,hga3wk,I believe Shane is actually Christian himself. I know his mom is very religious
3803,2020-06-27 22:35:57,hga3wk,"I thought Eugenia had said she had reached out to Shane for help with returning to YT after her break? (I can't remember which video, I'll have to double check). Though I agree I think she's still struggling a lot."
3804,2020-06-26 19:14:32,hga3wk,Wow. Okay. I think “canceling” him is way too light. Anyone that thinks like that scares the absolute shit out of me.
3805,2020-06-26 19:01:44,hga3wk,"Even if it were only about the blackface and the fact that he described how he would torture the black woman who called him out for it, that would be a valid reason for cancellation alone. But all of that other stuff you've mentioned is also extremely disturbing and makes me sick and angry."
3806,2020-06-26 19:18:48,hga3wk,"I’m going to say this as lightly as I can. You can’t be sure anyone would never do anything to a child, especially when they’ve made those types of comments. There are plenty of people in recent years that have been seen as “great” with children and then murders their own children or sexually abuses them."
3807,2020-06-26 20:11:51,hga3wk,"As someone who has been sexually molested for years, I would never joke about those things he's joked about, specially not on a public platform. If he were actually molested, he wouldn't make these jokes to the public. 

If you've gone through molestation as a child, you would never make fun of a kid potentially going through that situation - that's just wrong."
3808,2020-06-26 21:28:01,hga3wk,Ooooh! Okay. I thought she was flirting or such with him.
3809,2020-06-27 00:38:20,hga3wk,"Bless your cotton socks! I have been on the search for if she got a divorce for years now and he just kinda vanished without a trace. I was like “damn, did the demon in her house eat him?”"
3810,2020-06-26 18:29:35,hga3wk,"interesting! Thanks for answering my question, I didn't want you to think I was going to ask for his info."
3811,2020-06-26 21:30:45,hga3wk,"Oh got it. Yeah, she was super young when she got married. Some things are personal and just aren’t our business but I feel like if you share that aspect of your life, that you should touch base on it a little bit. Either way, I hope she’s doing well."
3812,2020-06-26 23:07:13,hga3wk,"She actually finally admitted to being divorced!! (second handedly)  She mentioned her ""ex-husband"" having mental health issues that they both think were made worse by him being in the service.

It was so bizarre how she just didn't mention him again for a solid four years though, lol"
3813,2020-06-29 07:26:57,hga3wk,"You seem to be up to date with this stuff and I’ve been dying to know, do you have any idea what happened with her and Haley Reese and like their soul sibling group? I’ve seen them dance around the subject a bit but can’t seem to find any tea on it and whatever happened seems like SOMETHING not just growing apart. But I’ve been wrong before and certainly could be mistaken."
3814,2020-06-29 06:02:37,hga3wk,it’s just funny cause the original comment compared to the edit it’s so difference. sounds like u were implying she was a home wrecker
3815,2020-06-27 00:05:42,hga3wk,this is *QUITE* disturbing....
3816,2020-06-26 18:33:47,hga3wk,"i agree. sure, they are engaged and it is hard to leave a partner in which you share a home and pets with. also ryland hasn’t done anything to “cancel” himself. BUT, him continuing to stay with him, in my eyes, shows that he is 100% okay with what shane has said and done. 

the fact that ryland isn’t trying to stand up for how shane “has changed” is very strange thing to me though. it’s why i also don’t want to jump the gun on him too quick. even kim stood up for kanye when he was making a fool of himself. maybe there is something going down behind the scenes with them. it really is just a waiting game at this point. yet i would not be surprised at all if ryland were to stay with him, he’s already in deep and i’m positive shane’s shown him a side we haven’t even seen after all this time. who knows what they’ve done that wasn’t recorded or documented at all, probably things 100x worse than what we’ve been shown."
3817,2020-06-27 20:47:51,hga3wk,Oh ok thank you (:
3818,2020-06-26 20:55:32,hga3wk,"There's an old sound bite from a podcast where he talks about about a 5-6 year old Instagrammer girl. He calls her sexy. He then goes on a spiel about why pedophilia is a strange taboo because what's wrong with googling naked babies but not googling feet pics. It's... Really strange and tone deaf. I think it was during his shock humor phase, but it doesn't even come across as an obvious joke."
3819,2020-06-26 20:50:52,hga3wk,"Just look through this subreddit, it's all there"
3820,2020-06-26 21:34:46,hga3wk,"It is certainly wrong to laugh at abuse. But I doubt that means Shane lied about experiencing it. If someone jokes about abuse, that doesn’t inherently mean it couldn’t have happened to them... But it does mean they are messed up. 

I just don’t feel comfortable speculating on whether someone’s lying when they have said they’ve been molested. I don’t want to give leeway to the disbelief of victims that commonly happens.  

Regardless, he can’t try to use what happened to him as a justification for those “jokes” because there is no justification for it... It’s inherently wrong. And a reason is not an excuse. Whether they’ve experienced molestation or not, every person has a choice in how they react and behave. Shane made the choice to do those things and no one but himself is responsible for what he did."

3822,2020-06-26 21:36:19,hga3wk,Yeah that’s my feeling is that she showed him and talked about him being in the military then to just stop talking about him made some people think he died because she stopped and changed everything after she said he was gonna be on leave for a long time . To me she at least should make a statement to clarify he isn’t dead at least. Could you imagine your ex rather having the viewers think your dead than admit a failed marriage?!?
3823,2020-06-26 23:11:22,hga3wk,She did?!? Must have been after I gave up on her. Any idea which video?
3824,2020-06-29 20:09:04,hga3wk,"Both Haley and fuck I can’t think of the guys name have both slipped up and talked about how a friend they had that tried to split them up they found out was doing the same about them. So loey was telling Haley shit on the guy and vice versa because they stopped being friends with each other before they dumped loey. Idk how but they found out she was doing the same about themselves and was just bad mouthing everyone (not sure if she did outside of the group but really why wouldn’t she?) so they realized it and hashed it out and became BFFs again and then cut her totally out and posted vague shit like they hope some one gets help and stuff about backstabbing etc. 

That’s all I’ve been able to piece together lol. The tweets could be unrelated but they did both say on lives (diff ones I think) that some one had talked shit to break them up and they ended up dumping that person and it was a few months after. Other wise they have stayed completely silent."

3826,2020-06-26 18:39:15,hga3wk,"It is hard when you are engaged and live in the same house and have pets. Me and my fiancé have just split and we live in the same house and have pets so I can relate to it being hard. Specially when you aren’t the one in the wrong. Although my situation is in no way related to racism, abuse or pedophilia. 

I think that if he was truly on Shane’s side he would have defended him by now. I can only hope he’s walked away from it. I truly believe that Ryland could be successful on his own, he doesn’t need Shane for clout if that’s why he’s hanging around. Clout from Shane isn’t the kind of clout anyone wants anymore."
3827,2020-06-26 20:22:25,hga3wk,"I think Shane is abusive and it can be tough to stand up to an abusive partner, particularly when there is a financial incentive issue."
3828,2020-06-26 21:03:27,hga3wk,"Oh wow, that’s honestly disgusting. No matter what phase he was in there’s no excuse for it. Thanks for filling me in."

3835,2020-06-26 23:15:04,hga3wk,"I think it was actually on Twitter. She responded to a thread about mental health and mentioned him. I only saw it because someone on gurugossip was following her and noticed it.

Tbh, her current horror fans probably don't even know she was ever married since back then she was still doing mostly clothes and makeup tutorials. I really don't ever expect her to say it on camera."
3836,2020-06-30 01:16:48,hga3wk,That sucks but also seems pretty par for the course of have a threesome of friends. It’s really hard not to slip into toxic habits and vent to the other friend which can evolve into full blown hateful gossip pretty fast
3837,2020-07-02 20:53:12,hga3wk,[removed]
3838,2020-06-26 23:22:59,hga3wk,"I think if he walked away now there would be some people who think his fame is riding off Shane’s, but he does have a large fan base of his own. I haven’t watched all his videos, but the ones I have watched and enjoyed did not feature Shane. He has his own thing going."
3839,2020-06-26 21:24:52,hga3wk,yes- i think ppl are making this seem like an easy cut away break up but it is more than what we see. they love each other and this is really shitty but i’m sure Ryland doesn’t want to leave shane at rock bottom (even if he deserves it)
3840,2020-06-27 05:15:19,hga3wk,"That’s a big and serious accusation and idk if it’s really smart to accuse someone of that if you don’t know. I think it’s definitely possible, especially given how Shane always plays the victim and is kinda rude and condescending toward Ryland in videos. But at the end of the day, these are people who we don’t actually know and we shouldn’t make accusations like that based on what we’ve seen in videos unless it’s like, pretty clear that’s what’s happening, you know what I mean?"
3841,2020-06-27 18:49:26,hga3wk,"I’m not sure on that. I mean we have no proof that he is an abuser towards Ryland. Without proof really we honestly shouldn’t say it. 

I know that Shane has done bad things and those things have been proven and that is one thing. But I won’t personally comment on anything that hasn’t got proof to back it up."
3842,2020-07-02 21:19:12,hga3wk,[deleted]
3843,2020-06-26 23:26:25,hga3wk,"I think he would be fine on his own. He doesn’t need Shane at all. I think Ryland could make more than enough money without Shane. 

To be honest even if he couldn’t, it’s not about money is it? It’s the principle. For me I just wouldn’t be able to stay with a person who has done and said the things Shane has. No amount of Love that I had for them would make me stay. Specially since this has all been proven."
3844,2020-06-27 18:52:43,hga3wk,"I can completely relate to that, I have myself been in a situation of wanting to walk away from somebody who was in a bad mind set. I didn’t because I didn’t want his mental health to get worse, specially as he had twice attempted suicide and had been an inpatient at a facility. 

Funny enough though when I was going through mental turmoil he walked away from me so.... let’s hope that if Ryland ever has mental issues that Shane stands by him too. I’d hate for anyone to go through what I am going through right now."
3845,2020-06-27 07:25:03,hga3wk,"I love your attitude, which is the right one to take, but I actually do know - we can see his abuse of her in his videos!"
3846,2020-06-27 19:14:16,hga3wk,We do have proof. It's documented in Shane's and Ryland's videos.
3847,2020-06-27 19:14:56,hga3wk,Can you link the video please? Because I’ve never seen a video of Shane being abusive to Ryland.
3848,2020-06-26 13:42:33,hg7arg,"I agree. I'm American, and all of my peers are at the stage of life where they're working themselves to death to pay for house mortgages and cars or the next new shiny thing because that is what we've always been told means you're successful in life. 

By contrast, I saved every penny i made for many years and purchased outright a small home in a rural area. I don't rush out to buy the newest tech, or go to the newest shopping malls or whatever. I am content to live a simple life: roof over my head and food for my family. I have a modest fixed income, and I'm perfectly happy with it and am able to live comfortably within my means. i spend my time pursuing hobbies and traveling when possible.

The trouble is, when you choose a life completely different than everyone around you it can be quite lonely. Its hard to find things in common with others to talk about."
3849,2020-06-26 13:35:35,hg7arg,"Damn, that was really powerful. Thank you for offering your insight."
3850,2020-06-26 17:47:48,hg7arg,"I think it may be the people you are around. I know plenty of greedy money hunger people exist, but most Americans, at least in my circle, just do life. We work, provide for our families, and hope to have enough to pursue hobbies and interests. I’ve been fortunate enough to be able to do that. I think you need to find new friends.

Btw I have no idea who Jeffrey Starr is."
3851,2020-06-26 18:42:39,hg7arg,"I just don't understand this.  As a Russion, why do you give a shit about anything an American wants or equates success to?  Why does it matter to you?

Also do you believe that this is an American only problem?  Let me introduce you to the British Royal family.  

Also I will once again point out that America is really not a country.  We are the United States of America and why that is important is that while we have one main set of laws that covers all of the citizens (the Constitution and amendments) each state has their own set of laws and regulations.  Each city in those states sometimes also have their own laws and ordinances as well.  

I say that last part to say the next part.  All Americans do NOT share the same values.  For every person in America who worships the Kardashians and their ilk there are people who have no idea who they are.  I can tell you from my own family that I have Aunts and Uncles and Cousins who would have zero idea who any of them are.  They all live offline.  In other words none of them have any social media.  They have computers but only use it to research things.

I just think sometimes there is a perception of the U.S. that our media (films, tv, news) perpetuates that make us seem all one way when in reality nothing could be further from the truth."
3852,2020-06-26 16:35:10,hg7arg,"American here too. This is the way I choose to live my life as well. I have a career that I somewhat enjoy, don't necessarily hate the job but it's easy money and it pays all my bills. 

I have a roof over my head, I'm surrounded by a few close friends who have been supportive during hard times and I'm nurtured by so much love from my husband and family. 

I don't have many material things, but all these combined I feel I have found success in my life. It does make me feel shitty though when there are a lot of ""side"" peers who always want to talk about how much they make, their side hustle to earn even more money what they own, buying what's trendy just because it's new and dare they question why I don't hop onto the trend. It's fucking annoying honestly."
3853,2020-06-26 22:30:29,hg7arg,"In part I care because American culture influences me every day. Not even mentioning the fact that I spend most of my time on social media around american people, the absolute majority of films, TV shows, modern books even music ffs comes from America (or the UK). I'm not saying that literally all americans believe in the things I'd mentioned, I'm simply saying that there are trends which are very different from anything I would see in my country. I understand that US is a diverse country and all of the individuals have their own stories and views. It's a rule that is aplicable to any and every country. In Russia there are a lot of ancaps, for example. But what I was trying too say is that there are trends that may influence people that are specific to the US (or maybe not just the us but some other western countries). 

And also idk why you tied the british monarchs into this, because I don't think people strive to be like them because it's simply impossible lmao"
3854,2020-06-26 23:58:41,hg7arg,"I introduced the British Royal family because the pursuit and adulation of wealth is not exclusive the U.S.  Use Richard Branson in his place if that helps.  

Are there trends?  Maybe, hell I'm sure there are for some but again we have more than 300 million people in our country.  Most of what you see in films, tv, music and books comes from a very small section of our cultural and ideological viewpoints.

The reason you don't see the people who don't care about wealth is because the very small minority that produces films, tv, music, books do care very deeply about money.  Even when they say they don't."
3855,2020-06-26 05:54:08,hg1vi5,"Cancel culture, man. It’s done. All of it. Who in their right mind would even bother with doing anything even remotely funny or edgy anymore. 

Just pull out the 6 and pipe it down the fairway."
3856,2020-06-26 07:12:31,hg1vi5,"The fact that Jeffree Starr is still allowed to exist in the ""celebrity"" world blows my mind."
3857,2020-06-26 13:21:17,hg1vi5,"LMAO if y'all cancel culturers saw how I was 2 years ago, y'all would go on a cancel spree against me. Just saying...

But yeah fuck cancel culture, and fuck everyone who participates in it."
3858,2020-06-26 13:35:21,hg1vi5,"The worst part about humans in general is their lack of checking what's true or not. If some random person with an anonymous twitter account says a famous person is a racist or any other accusation, a surprisingly high amount of people take that as truth.  It's the idiots that agree with everything without researching it that are the real problem. There will always be idiots, but if we can check their BS and make up our own minds they'll lose all their power."
3859,2020-06-26 06:00:43,hg1vi5,"Cancel culture needs to cancel itself. It only cancels innocent people. I saw tons of tweets today saying that these innocent people [Jenna] deserve this horrible treatment because of what they did when they were young. People are allowed to make mistakes and grow from it, but alas, no one seems to care about that. You're only allowed to be perfect and if you're not, your career is over."
3860,2020-06-26 10:12:14,hg1vi5,Agreed. Well said.
3861,2020-06-26 06:05:00,hg1ie3,Jenna didn’t leave youtube because of cancel culture. Hardly anyone was talking about her old videos. She left because she’s holding herself accountable & feels bad for her actions. I hope she’ll be back though she’s one of my favorite youtubers.
3862,2020-06-26 06:54:06,hg1ie3,"Jenna didn’t experience cancel culture. She made that video on her own terms. It’s called holding yourself accountable.

And I actually want her to come back to the platform."
3863,2020-06-26 05:48:38,hg1ie3,"The only reason cancel culture is toxic is because people don't cancel the right people and they cancel them but then 5 days later want to jump on the bandwagon of liking them again. Does Jenna deserve to be cancelled? No. She took responsibility, owned up to it and made no excuses. Unlike Shane who has had 15,000 times to own up but also makes excuses of ""oh it's a joke"" or ""oh I'm too sensitive"" and throws a tantrum at 30. That's the issue with Shane. If he owned up to it, dropped Jeffree and tried to change from his mistakes, there wouldn't be an issue. But there is so much dirt on Shane and all he does is run from it."
3864,2020-06-26 05:50:33,hg1ie3,He deserves his success he's made mistakes in the past but address them and apologize and hasn't done anything of the sort since. If he wants to be friends with people who's done questionable things that's his business nobody else's and we should all respect that but in the world filled with Twitter sjw's who feed off of drama just like the people they try to cancel AKA Jeffery they won't.. lol oh the irony...
3865,2020-06-26 17:01:05,hg1ie3,"Agreed. She was also getting tired I believe and finding idea's for video's lately and creative stuff. Which tbh happens in any creative industry but especially when your job is to make weekly vlog video's. She's also a much more genuinely emotional person too so I think that combined with just needing a social media break and yes some attacks from cancel culture warriors all mixed together to make her need a break. Be it permanent or not.

I do think other people did DM here nasty mean messages for sure but it was kind of the icing on the cake and she seemed like she needed a break. I hope it's a good time for her to just get in a good head space, relax and find what makes her happy. If that is coming back to her channel or just Juliens channel that's great and I'd love to see her and support her. But I also support her if she feels that isn't for her anymore too and she wants to do something else creative off camera."
3866,2020-06-26 05:51:54,hg1ie3,He did own up to it many time..
3867,2020-06-26 06:13:58,hg1ie3,"Two things, which was blackface and the pedo thing. And he made excuses for both. ""Oh it's because I do dark humor"" and ""oh it's because I like saying shocking things to make people laugh""

Okay, what about saying about underage fans how he wants to rape all of them? Or the other things he's said? Or with this new thing about James Charles? When people were coming at him, did he stay and address it to try to solve the problem or did he throw a tantrum, try to make people feel sorry for him and run away? Well I shouldn't say he ran away because he's still on Twitter liking tweets....."
3868,2020-06-26 06:30:43,hg1ie3,He's apologized for the blackface along with everything he's said and done in the past so unless you want him to make a very long list and personally address every single thing hes done wrong and apologize to them idk what else to tell you lol and idk about the James Charles drama so i cant speak on it but I will say this back then comedy was a lot different than it is today you would be appealed if you heard the Opie and Anthony show which was a nationally syndicated show on Sirius XM Radio that makes Shanes old videos look like Teletubbie reruns he's made mistakes like every one of us and has apologized for them many times so idk what else yall want from him besides seeing his down fall which to me is just as toxic as the people yall try to cancel...lol
3869,2020-06-26 06:36:42,hg1ie3,">idk what else yall want from him besides seeing his down fall which to me is just as toxic as the people yall try to cancel

Do you realize this sounds like gaslighting? *How* is it more toxic to think a racist/pedo deserves to be cancelled than it is to actually be a racist/pedo? Excuse me but that makes no sense. Just like trump supporters, you shane and jeffree stans will justify anything."
3870,2020-06-26 06:57:29,hg1ie3,Its the truth your just toxic. You call Shane a racist/pedo with no proof besides clips from his old comedy skits (Which TBH are not funny) and get trigged when someone doesn't go with you narrative. You didn't even acknowledged that he had already apologized for everything you just copied and pasted the last thing I said to try to prove your weird political point...lul
3871,2020-06-26 07:50:08,hg1ie3,"Shane called a 6 year old ""sexy"", laughed about a 4 month old baby being raped and murdered, and asked a 12 year old questions about sex and how to use sex toys.

When has he apologized for these things? These weren't jokes, and even if they were they are completely messed up and need to be addressed."
3872,2020-06-26 08:14:54,hg1ie3,He apologized for that when he made his fist & second apology video  he addressed that he's made some stupid videos and stupid decisions (AKA the videos your talking about) and that he was very remorseful about it. Your just upset because he didn't name all of the things he's done specifically so to you its like he didn't apologize at all when in fact he did...lul
3873,2020-06-26 14:10:28,hg1ie3,How about him talking about how he had a dream where he wanted to torture someone for not agreeing with his racist behaviour?

3877,2020-06-28 02:22:33,hfyyhq,The shade oral in the breaker palettes. That's more duochrome.

3880,2020-06-26 02:14:00,hfyvni,I can't take this seriously when she constantly reviews his palettes and shows them in videos. She shouldn't have to have her own brand in order to drop a racist and vile person from her life and channel.
3881,2020-06-26 02:06:56,hfyvni,Didn’t she use his brand on camera VERY recently?
3882,2020-06-26 02:07:23,hfyvni,Pretty meaningless based on how much she has backed him (despite knowing better)
3883,2020-06-26 02:27:50,hfyvni,You should have dropped Jeffree this whole time 🙄
3884,2020-06-26 02:11:25,hfyvni,hmm seems weird since she just used his brand a couple videos back
3885,2020-06-26 02:12:11,hfyvni,Sis is feeling the heat. Should’ve never let Joffrey back in her life after he did her dirty the first time.
3886,2020-06-26 02:21:13,hfyvni,"Doesn't matter, she is still always promoting him very openly"
3887,2020-06-26 02:25:04,hfyvni,"Don’t give a shit, people love to dump problematic assholes they’ve always supported when it affects their income and reputation. I feel the same way about Jenna Marbles. Don’t openly support Jeffree Star and then expect people to believe you’re nothing like him."
3888,2020-06-26 02:39:29,hfyvni,Her feminism is for white people and white people only. So sad to see someone have such a large platform and only use it for this chicken shit “shade.”
3889,2020-06-26 02:17:35,hfyvni,"Nikki....don't even when you have been supporting J* as recently as a month ago! Sorry, but hyp•o•crite."
3890,2020-06-26 01:59:35,hfyvni,"a fan asks nikkie to launch a makeup brand so they can drop jeffree and nikkie likes it.

shade, but one can only wonder if her faint opposition of jeffree now is because of his racism/neonazism or his collusion to take down james (who is good friends with her) during dramageddon 2. 🙃🧐

Maybe she believed he changed and now sees that he didn’t. She seems to be the only one who was willing to go toe to toe with him.

3913,2020-06-25 19:50:52,hfr8np,"Depends on the price difference. Fuck Jeffree Star for sure. But if its *that* much cheaper and the only thing you get from him, then okay. That limecrime looks way more yellow and the Star one sadly looks by far the best (I prefer liquid lipstick to normal). 

That being said, are there any local places you live (or even Sephoras) you can go online and check out? I've seen green lip colors like that on sale for like $5! Usually bold colors like that go on sale often which is nice :)"
3914,2020-06-27 09:17:50,hfr8np," UPDATE Y'ALL:
So, since the last time I talked here I ended up buying a pigment in the same shade as JS' from Nyx and a multitasking mixing primer from them too, and it was cheaper too, I saved some bucks by going to Nyx.
I found an alternative better than those brands I talked about in the title, and it is 2 in 1: I mix them up and the result can be used as either a liner or even a lipstick.

Hooray! :)))"
3915,2020-06-25 19:57:25,hfr8np,"Yeah, fuck Jeffree. He's an ass. That's the problem, the Jeffree Star lipstick indeed looks the best and I am enraged like ahh. I've looked up Sephora and other lipsticks online that are green, but nowhere near these shades so I don't know what to do. Most greens are deep, forest-y, and the only most normal ones are by indie brands on Etsy, or maybe in some obscure shops in my city, but at least they're cheaper than JS and LC.

I'll try doing what you just said and I hope I'll have luck this time :)) I hope I can find a sale."
3916,2020-06-25 20:27:07,hfr8np,"Good luck!! :) Maybe Colorpop might have something? Theres also this lip tar stuff you can make your own lip colors out of using eye shadow which is cool! 
But hey if you're set on the JS one and can't find anything better, go for it. Not like he's getting much money from that one lipstick anyways, although I agree itd be nice if there was an alternative!"
3917,2020-06-25 20:39:05,hfr8np,"Thanks again! I'm not sure if Colourpop has anything this green, only this very very dark green Safiya Nyygard collab lipstick. And the Lip Tar? From OCC? Or is it some kind of unheard black magic that I need to check out ASAP? I'll try looking tho for another alternative, saw some stuff from indie brands that were cute, but if there's really no other option left. 

Let's hope for the best! :DD"
3918,2020-06-26 08:19:24,hfr8np,"Yeah good luck! And yes the OCC one, but I just learned they're apparently not in business anymore :("
3919,2020-06-26 08:27:18,hfr8np,"It's so sad tho. I'm still trying to find alternatives, most shops I've tried to find green lipstick in have closed ddown due to the pandemic, and I'll dig even deeper than now :(((("
3920,2020-06-26 08:27:46,hfr8np,OCC really had some good stuff
3921,2020-06-26 08:29:41,hfr8np,"They did! Ahh. At this point I'd just get the JS one. If you're set on the color and no where easily has something similar, then just go for it and enjoy it :)"
3922,2020-06-26 08:39:23,hfr8np,"I've seen some similar colours, some truly pretty, but I really have truly been dead set on this one because of a cosplay that I'm thinking of doing, so I've been torn been  JS and some indie brands that I also have on the list, who have some cool greens. But I might finally buy JS' because it's easier to find, and the indie ones I'l keep as a last resort, even if they're cheaper (shipping costs because I live in Europe).

Nobody will kill me if I buy just one lipstick :DD"
3923,2020-06-26 08:39:49,hfr8np,And thank you for your help!! :))))) 😊😊💗💗
3924,2020-07-13 16:24:29,hfqf19,"It's just expensive crap in a bottle. Better spend your money a higher quality lipstick. Everyone is buying his makeup so they could flex, just don't do it"
3925,2020-06-25 19:23:59,hfpzkr,"I have a personality disorder. Hearing Kati, a supposed mental health professional sit there with a DSM and scrunch her nose up and say a mental illness is “icky”? What are you, a 3 year old who doesn’t want to eat peas? It was dangerous, I’m just gonna say that. People with mental illnesses get antagonized so much already by the masses and media. 

I couldn’t finish the series, I knew immediately it wasn’t something I could sit through."
3926,2020-06-25 18:34:26,hfpzkr,I have a strong hatred for Kati Morton.

3928,2020-06-25 23:38:38,hfpzkr,"I have followed BLT since 2009, talked on and off with her, and I genuinely hate how he did her in the documentary series. Her story wasn’t deserving of being spliced with stupid Chuck E. Cheese pizza. It was a vitally important message that young people needed to hear and it was immensely disrespectful to her to put such childish antics in there with her harrowing bravery. She deserved more respect and you would think as an old friend, he would pay that to her. But instead, we get 6 hours of J* flaunting his gross wealth and acting like he runs the world instead of longer, in-depth content about actually fascinating and important awareness stories. I think it’s interesting how SD can’t keep friends around, that’s always been a red flag to me."
3929,2020-06-25 18:09:16,hfpzkr,"When I am watching the TanaCon series, I was sort on Michael's side because I feel that Tana wasnt taken it serious by going on holiday and partying instead of planning but Michael was at fault too as he knew that the venue was too small, that there should have been food and water and he should have made the gift bags better than a shitty condom, some children stickers and a landon"
3930,2020-06-25 19:10:00,hfpzkr,"That episode with Eugenia REALLY bothered me...the way he framed it as, “oh great, look how she’s fully recovered,” when it’s not that simple at all."
3931,2020-06-25 17:48:35,hfpzkr,"Call me crazy but I'm now starting to wonder if these YouTubers paid Shane to do a series on them, and how much they paid is how many episodes. It'd explain why Jake had three, Tanna three, and Jeffree multiple with many episodes. I'm thinking the docu on Shanes Dad, then Brittanys, and maybe even Eugenias may have been Shane's doing (free), but tana, Jake, and Jeffree could of seen the positive results and paid for theirs? Maybe even graveyardgirl paid for hers... though her channel is still dead lol Could explain the wait times in the most recent Jeffree one and Shane's freak outs because Shane's on payroll to make Jeffree look good and his ideas went south and he had take a complete different approach and didn't know what to do 
Idk just my ramblings"
3932,2020-06-25 19:25:34,hfpzkr,"I didn’t even watch the series, but I did get a glimpse in a part where she said that. As a person with different mental health disorders/illnesses, I completely agree with you"
3933,2020-06-25 18:43:25,hfpzkr,I really hate how she says that sociopathy is “gross”. Like I’ve never heard a professional therapist say that adjective when talking about a mental health issue. That’s like saying people that are depressed or have anxiety disorders that they’re gross.
3934,2020-06-26 00:53:44,hfpzkr,Why is it that she has all of these credentials and college certifications to be a therapist yet when she talks on youtube it sounds like she's getting all of her shit from the Mayo Clinic?
3935,2020-06-25 19:26:48,hfpzkr,The fact that she's a therapist is disgusting. She really should know better. And then she responded so horribly to the valid criticism.
3936,2020-06-25 21:48:15,hfpzkr,"Dude same, the fact that she LITERALLY helped Jaclyn Glenn with getting Eugenia Cooney help then when she was in Shanes series talked bad about the people that got her help...like what? She needs her credentials revoked"
3937,2020-06-25 18:07:14,hfpzkr,He did a day in the life type thing which was probably the last of the longer formatted videos before he started calling them docu-series.
3938,2020-06-25 18:04:57,hfpzkr,I’m sure it’s because lots of people would be done with him if he showed too much association with her. I am surprised too though
3939,2020-06-25 18:12:23,hfpzkr,I think it should do one on Trish and call her out for the way she treated the DID community by pretending to have alters and the LGBT community for pretending that she is transgender plus she is a meth addict
3940,2020-06-26 01:04:33,hfpzkr,"I also think maybe him and BLT just separated ways because of change in content, but you exactly hit the nail on the head. Like yes, the makeup process in itself is fascinating when you haven’t experienced it before, but that could’ve been an hour long video (like EC or Bunny’s) instead of a ? amount of episodes. And like somebody said before, Brittani did write a fantastic book about it, but I also feel like BLT should’ve gotten her own video instead of being lazily edited between two other conspiracies, one of which being CEC pizza"
3941,2020-06-25 18:10:13,hfpzkr,"I do agree that they both messed up, I was more so focusing on shane making it seem like it was all Michael’s fault and not tana’s"
3942,2020-06-25 19:12:44,hfpzkr,"I didn’t really watch it, I am more or less speaking about how hers and Brittani’s stories were treated. Why not show a 3-part series about Brittani’s story, as she is definitely not the first or last woman that goes through this? And with Eugenia, there are tons of people with EDs. It’s just... off, ya know? But yea, I can see how people feel disgusted with the Eugenia one"
3943,2020-06-25 18:07:15,hfpzkr,"I mean that is a good theory, I just don’t see it happening with being paid. TanaCon I believe was because shane was going to be a part of it and didn’t know it would become a shit show and wanted to understand what was going on with Tana."
3944,2020-06-26 03:54:37,hfpzkr,Because she really doesn’t know what she’s talking about. She’s a marriage/family therapist

3946,2020-06-26 21:15:56,hfpzkr,"I think calling Trisha out would be bad for him, as soon as someone wrongs Trisha, she dishes back HARD. She’s known to destroy so many guys she’s dated. Nobody with the right mind would get anywhere close to her. 

Is there proof that she’s on meth? You can see she’s on uppers in some of her videos, but it’s hard to say."
3947,2020-06-26 01:14:47,hfpzkr,Absolutely. I’m just always shocked about how many people he’s had around him that haven’t stayed in contact. I’ve just always been curious if it’s about descent in views and things with people like JoeNation and Shanna.
3948,2020-06-25 18:22:09,hfpzkr,"Last thing I heard was that Good Times Entertainment went bankrupt and Michael is now the CEO and President of a company called Juice Krate which help creators with management, monetization, branding, merchandise, live events, and more."
3949,2020-06-25 19:18:52,hfpzkr,"I get what you’re saying. It was really expecting there to be more on Eugenia, it felt very random. But who knows, maybe she wasn’t open to more. I get why people complain about him interspersing Brittani’s story with the whole pizza thing, but at the time, I took as him trying to set it up as just a normal conspiracy video to get more people to watch it. I think it did shed light on an important issue. But I can see why you’d like to see more attention on it too."
3950,2020-06-25 22:18:48,hfpzkr,"Not to defend Shane, but I think the reason Brittani’s was a very short thing is because she has actually written a book about the whole ordeal. So doing a full 3 part series would take away from that. 

That said it would make a good documentary, even if Brittani was just a jump off point to other people’s stories.

The book is really good btw."
3951,2020-06-25 18:10:48,hfpzkr,"Wouldn't it of been funny if he had done a Tana/Jake episode like he did with Brittany and ChuckECheese? Zoom in on Jake with the therapist, cut to Tana bawling on the couch, back to Jake's house tour, cut to Tana screaming at the event planner on FaceTime 🤣"
3952,2020-06-25 20:44:03,hfpzkr,Associating with Jeffree has always been way worse.
3953,2020-06-27 00:23:06,hfpzkr,On her podcast episode with Shane as a guest she admitted to using meth.
3954,2020-06-25 22:19:57,hfpzkr,"I actually bought the book, I didn’t finish it but I probably should. That is actually a very fair point, I just think that because they were such good friends before that Shane would try and get the situation out there"

Growing up my buddies and I called people like this SAPS (soft ass pussies).

Today the whole world seems to be full of SAPS.

Can’t joke, cant have an opinion that criticizes in the slightest, can’t disagree, can’t be uncomfortable or offended by anything yourself...

The world is so fucked.

I blame the internet and social media.

I fucken hate reddit too. I don’t even know why I am commenting on this haha.

Boredom I guess.

Cheers."
3963,2020-06-25 21:15:17,hfl9rg,"As a black man myself, I’m so fucking annoyed with these people. One of my friend’s insta account got leaked, along with our school, for saying the n word as joke while offending nobody, even though it happened a long ass time ago. I literally kept arguing with idiotic white girls since they never shut it the fuck up, and it pisses me off. Best part about this is how no one would give a fuck without the movement, except for people who genuinely care about us and everyone else. Fuck these fake ass “supporters”, and god bless the great people of this world."

People can't take a joke if their lives depended on it. I agree"

3970,2020-06-28 13:24:22,hfl9rg,"I mean, I don’t like Jeffree Star because he knew Dahvie Vanity was a pedo and did nothing to stop it. If anything, he helped him by touring with him and being his “brother.” Or him posting revenge porn, which is illegal. Or him saying Dahvie’s victims, who some have claimed Jeffree was in the room when Dahvie was being incredibly inappropriate with them, and Jeffree said those girls were lying. Then there’s the fact he has admitted on camera that he has sexually assaulted men. BUT as for the race issue, it’s not my place to say. I don’t appreciate those jokes. I find them crass and honestly, just not funny and rather inappropriate, but I’m a white girl and it’s not my place to get offended over something like that. Most people are coming after Jeffree because of a whole list of reasons. Every creepy and racist joke has to be reframed because of who Jeffree is as a person, compared to some idiot white guy who just doesn’t know what his joke means or how it could affect people."

3972,2020-06-25 16:43:06,hfl9rg,"Ikr?! I want to joke around saying how stupid and useless White males are and they should all jump off a cliff. But I keep getting told it hurts their little feelings. :( It's offensive to hurt a white male ego. ;'(

But I'm just joking! I don't really think all white males are stupid and useless and should kill themselves. The joke is that they should. What's the difference between that and joking about ruining a POC face?

Ugh it's so annoying they keep taking away our freedom of speech! >:("

4015,2020-06-25 06:34:16,hfh2f3,"Drug store- NYX had a single I used waaaaay back when I first got into makeup. I think Wet n’ Wild had one too. If you’re ok with a palette try Revolution or Essence. Also I haven’t used this brand but I hear nothing but good about Juvia’s Place. No singles that I’m aware of, but you can get bright reds in a palette. Also maybe Colour Pop, if not eyeshadow, certainly blush. 

High end- KVD vegan beauty or whatever they call themselves now had a shimmer one (or glitter? It wasn’t matte). I looooved their eyeshadows before Kat herself started acting a fool. Mac also had a blush that was pretty close to red and could be used as eyeshadow. I’d also check out Make Up Forever. Urban Decay might have a red too, it would be up their alley. I loved their eyeshadows a few years ago, but I feel like the quality has taken a downturn. They still work, it just take a little more effort for me. 

A good tip is to look for blushes that fit the color/tone you want. I’ve found for those bright colors the blush works better on me

ETA: how could I forget Sleek! I found them at Ulta after hearing about the brad from British beauty youtubers. I had a blush trio palette of orange/red blushes that were seriously so pigmented I couldn’t wear them on my cheeks. I used them as eyeshadow and they packed a PUNCH"

Jeffree is scary asf, I wouldn't want to be on his bad side. He has a huge amount of power and money"
4030,2020-06-24 20:16:54,hf89jo,I feel sorry for her because if she unfollowed him on everything and not Shane just stated that J☆ is family to him it probably makes her uncomfortable. Morgan is genuinely his family (at least she will be) and she doesn't really have much of a choice. Idk I bet there's some awkward vibes with Ryland and Shane atm. That's just my opinion i hope she's okay i don't think/im not aware that she's problematic so I feel genuinely bad for her.

If this is the case, I am praying that she separates herself from Shane and Jeffery and YouTube as much as she possibly can. I can’t imagine being Morgan.

4043,2020-06-24 20:07:33,hf6k2e,"Shane has always been this way. He cycles out friends, thrives on gossip and drama, is vulgar & degenerate.... I could go on. He's never hid who he was. He was attracted to Jeffree and became so close to him BECAUSE this is how he is. Shane is also a manipulator. Shane has admitted to being an asshole on multiple occasions too. 

 In the beginning, he was more religious. He talked about God and saving his virginity until he was married. He tried to be wholesome while also mixing in characters like Shanaynay (gag) and that gross aunt character lol


 Then it went full on gross out humor and really uncomfortable comments on a lot of things. After this he fell from grace and was irrelevant.

 He kinda came back again with Lisa but he was REALLY scummy and gross then. And around the time he made that shit excuse for a movie, he was a nightmare on set and ruined his relationship with his manager Lauren. 

 Then we all remember the Shane that would burn barbies and graze on camera in his kitchen and with Trisha Paytas. I feel like the both of them took advantage of a young and vulnerable Drew Monson. Drew and Trisha revived his relevancy. 

He used Garrett & Drew because he KNEW they were bringing in the views for him. I think Drew dropped Shane because he was way too toxic, and Garrett & Shane fizzled out because Shane was a fucking asshole to him on camera and I can't imagine what he was like off camera. I don't believe it's all a persona. There's truth in every joke."
4044,2020-06-24 19:04:07,hf6k2e,"Shane Dawson has been on YouTube for 15 years. 
For 12 years we’ve been seeing Shane Yaw. These last three years have ushered in Shane Dawson . He is not the same person he used to be, he is putting in an act.

( remember the video defending ryland about how he’s just using Shane he confirmed they all put on a front for the camera, Shane is a “queen queer icon” now, ryland is bougie, Morgan is stupid)


The video: the trailer we all got was Shane diving into the beauty community(BC) investigator style. Why are they so dramatic? Why is there always trouble? Why are they the most problematic community we have in YT? And what I believe, “how can I [ Shane Dawson] fix it. The ONLY manipulation that took place would’ve been Jeffree Star getting in Shane’s ear to direct the series on the business of beauty and them instead of focusing on the drama because J* would be the obvious villain.  Also just spinning the web, JC is plummeting so they can capitalize on that and paint themselves out to be innocent, best friends, unbothered, BC heroes. That is the most manipulation from J* I see. Shane, otherwise, a 30 year old man did everything in his own. 

The statement he deleted: the fact that it’s deleted proves he isn’t sorry. The fact that he said he deserved it proves he isn’t sorry. The fact that he- (remember I said Shane Dawson is a character/this is all an act) - in a very serious post  about a very serious matter is still acting like a drag queen performer and putting on a show “she beat her face/ game of thrones references/ sassy behavior” shows insensitivity and insincerity. The fact that he openly defended J* in a “boys will be boys” fashion shows he’s also complicit with Trish and his other toxic friends behavior as well. 

Also When did he become friends with Tati? To the point of OPENLY defending her in a very shady organized way (I’m sure J* helped) right after the video (bye sisters)was posted?  And why have we never seen them together/ heard about their friendship since then ? 

Shane isn’t this sensitive anxiety filled character he pretends to be which pisses me off the most. The way he defended himself so immediately and strongly when he was being accused of being a pedo doesn’t fit his narrative, his coming out video wasn’t like this, the racism apologies weren’t like this, he was never this shaken, unbathed, dirty, anxious mess until the past few years. People with dark senses of humor like he has, people who make jokes about fucking cats, kids, black people love crack jokes, tits,pussy,dick jokes aren’t like this it takes boldness to be that wrong but in an attempt to rebrand and move away from all that; this is what his character evolved into. 

Imma stop but I could literally go on for hours about him and Jeffree. James has the entire world hate him for a lie, James wanted to kill himself, Shane Dawson, Jeffree Star, and Tati Westbrook profited off of it. Manipulation or not they’re all disgusting and old enough to know better."
4045,2020-06-25 04:49:05,hf6k2e,"Honestly I get so confused when people try and say that his “apology” wasn’t written by him, but by Jeffree. Have you ever seen any of his other apologies? They’re all the same. Blaming other people and trying to come off like an apology all the while he never actually apologises for anything. He has always been like this."

So it kinda hurts. 🤷🏻‍♀️

4054,2020-06-24 17:47:23,hf22qf,I literally rewatched watched the video this morning and couldn't understand why he sounded so mad like did you not expect any backlash at all?
4055,2020-06-25 10:26:07,hf22qf,"Maybe he and J* are the same, except J* is way more open about being horrible than Shane is, until ofc J* gets massively called out for something specific and he backtracks and says ""I was in a dark place, that's the old Jeffree coming out I'm not that person anymore"" ""I'm constantly learning and changing"". It's like J* whole personality is this nasty rich bi*** persona whereas Shane has the same traits hidden behind an innocent facade."
4056,2020-06-25 17:29:27,hf22qf,Super good point I’d never thought of before. This post should have more upvotes. Really annoying how Shane never directly addressed the predator accusations against James. I mean he didn’t really address things to begin with but he kinda just talked about the situation like they were taking James down a peg and not making incredibly serious accusations.
4057,2020-06-24 20:23:26,hf22qf,"Honestly, remember when Tati said she was so disgusted James allegedly said “Whatever, I’m a celebrity” when he hit on “straight” guys? Jeffree has always said he has a thing for straight guys AND he has a song called “Fuck Me, I’m a Celebrity”..."

4065,2020-06-24 05:45:56,heqp2t,"Jeffree hasn’t corrupted Shane, Shane corrupted Shane at every plateau he felt insecure about since at least 2009. 

Back when Youtube had large and small creators communicating and collaborating with each other I knew some of Shane’s old friends online. They all expressed similar sentiments of feeling discarded and abandoned. I didn’t even really know who Shane was at the time and no one regarded themselves as mini-celebs back then (god I sound so fkn old). Shane seemed to leap-frog to whoever made him look most important. 
I think he is having so much emotional trouble because of the internal conflict with wanting to feel valued and not understanding how to receive and give real value. I think while he probably had some remorse about this behavior in the past he is largely becoming like the grandiose narcs he follows to the top and abandoning real friends over and over again along the way."
4066,2020-06-24 02:59:03,heqp2t,Ok this is the first post on this sub that I agree with in awhile.
4067,2020-06-24 04:39:11,heqp2t,"What he did with James is disgusting, but regarding the racist stuff people keep bringing up, he has addressed those years ago but people act like he never addressed them. He mentioned he didn't even know blackface was racist and he never did it after that (in fact it had been a very long time since he hadn't done it after his apology). It was still wrong regardless, but back then people moved on because they realized it was ignorance more than anything."

4069,2020-06-24 04:31:23,heqp2t,Well said
4070,2020-12-01 15:08:42,heqp2t,"I thought I was the only one who really felt sad that he was cancelled and didn't even try to help himself. I really looked up to Shane and it does hurt to see how people are treating him. I loved watching his videos (the spoopy boi and ghost hunting ones especially, they made me laugh when nothing else could. ) I even had a quote that he said on my wall- ""I don't care that they won't have my genes because there going to have my heart"" I can't look at it now."
4071,2020-06-24 03:39:23,heqp2t,I remember seeing a clip of Garrett in the Jeffree star second docu series and I was really bummed out I didnt see it aha
4072,2020-06-24 05:51:35,heqp2t,Wow that’s honestly very insightful. To be honest I did watch Shane’s old content with Joey and Shanna and Lisa but I wasn’t heavily invested. I also didn’t care much for most of those creators. But it is weird to see his entire personality and friend circle shift so heavily.
4073,2020-06-24 03:02:31,heqp2t,I don't really want to see Jeffree get canceled either. I think his company provides a lot of jobs and happiness for people. I really liked buying his makeup and watching his videos. But his behavior is absolutely abhorrent. Much worse than Shane's in my opinion. But Shane backing up Jeffree and participating in his drama is really what's messed up about all this. Imagine if they didn't make the second series. Would drammagedon 2 even have happened??? Would it have gotten as intense as it did? I don't think so.
4074,2020-06-24 04:42:55,heqp2t,"He’s in a unique position where I believe that he should be happy to apologize more than once. If it were me with a shameful past like that, I would make it clear always and forever that I am sorry and I would never participate in that culture or behavior of racism. His past is particularly bad with these things. His relationships with racist influencers like Trisha Jeffree Jake Tana make it seem like he condones their behavior and therefore is not that sorry."
4075,2020-06-24 09:25:33,heqp2t,"Here is the thing with owning up to mistakes - it doesn't hurt to address the issue again. People who have truly changed and are disgusted by their past actions, won't hesitate to apologize and reflect on the progress they have done since. 

For example, Bretman's old videos resurfaced and he still apologized despite addressing it before. Drama handled maturely and nipped in the bud. 

It takes more energy to reject the idea of being humble enough to show remorse each time a problematic issue is brought up."
4076,2020-06-24 05:22:09,heqp2t,"TO BE FAIR I listened to that pedo clip again and Jessie said “Shane always makes jokes about the fact that he’s a pedophile and I hate it” or something to that extent. Yes I do think that his excuse of “I liked shocking my co-host” was true, but like wow the extent of it was pretty bad. And Jessie was like Shane please do not and he INSISTED on saying something that to this day is coming back to bite him. I agree that it’s just a joke. Shane is most likely not a pedophile. But there are consequences and he just needs to take those consequences and make better choices. Unfortunately he really hasn’t learned his lesson. Choices have consequences. You know that what you’re doing will eventually come back to you. You can either own that or run away and be a coward. I wish he would just own it."
4077,2020-06-24 08:04:19,heqp2t,"I don't like it either as we should be focusing on the matter ahead and not on fake recordings of Shane. But at the same time, he also supported someone being slammed with false allegations and doesn't seem to feel sorry for what happened to his person. Isn't he such an empath? Maybe he needed to be under fire again to become one again... or get a slice of humble pie?"
4078,2020-06-24 07:20:30,heqp2t,"It’s indeed a weird feeling. I feel solemnly sad about what’s happening with Shane the more I reflect on it. There’s a lot of nostalgia and symbolism Shane’s channel represented on Youtube because he was one of the first regular kids who made it big. Even though I never considered myself a true fan or anything, I thought maybe I could do that too (lmao no girl why didn’t you go to school for graphic design or something?!).

Even though I was a small Youtuber I acknowledge It was difficult to see my tiny 4k audience transition from talking with me and forming friendships to everyone talking about me as if I wasn’t there, sometimes in mean and insensitive ways. It was almost an immediate shift once I became a YT partner. I wonder if this is how ghosts feel at their own funerals. I might need to go to bed. 😂
Anyways this is what Shane could be experiencing but it’s no excuse. 

Youtube was a huge part of my life for a long time since I was 17 (I’m 29 now) and I favored that world in place of a real social life which I think happened to many young introverted creators. That causes huge problems, especially if you’re so insecure that you feel the need to create an elaborate persona and become afraid people will hate “the real you”. 

I had no concept of mental health in my teens and early 20s even. I’m not entirely projecting here; I think this may be similar to what caused Shane’s personality to fracture off. I can relate to his emotional dis-regulation which is why it’s tough to watch. 

I am actually very sensitive and it’s something obvious about me not a catch phrase. I wish Shane would stop throwing that word around. Lol
And I mean sensitive to all 5 senses, hormonal changes, external stimuli. 
I get headaches from it. Cilantro tastes like soap. Music makes me cry in the morning. 

I think he’s confusing being sensitive for having 0 emotional regulation tools and a social media addiction. He is well aware that he has a mental illness now it’s time to see a therapist outside of that one Youtube therapist."

I think maybe he needs to take a step back and just be a businessman and not get involved in drama. I also still have many unanswered questions about drammagedon 2, I need answers!! Hopefully one of them eventually puts out a video explaining all of that because I feel like we don’t have the full picture"
4080,2020-06-24 10:04:22,heqp2t,"The issue here is regarding James Charles. The blackface situation hasn't even reached him again. And I don't know why it resurfaces now again, it's not related to the JC situation. I know this will get downvoted, but I feel like people are using the current situation to just call him racist. He has been hanging with Jefree, Trisha etc for pretty long and people didn't care. 
Plus, I saw another post here about some girl called Francesca where Shane kept apologizing to her but they said he did it for emotional manipulation instead."
4081,2020-06-24 08:02:00,heqp2t,But Jeffree's narcissism doesn't allow him to step back and just be a business man.
4082,2020-06-24 12:50:53,heqp2t,"It resurfaced because of the BLM movement since the protests.  Its what got Kam & Tab to come out since plenty of BIPOC influencers were reflecting on their roles supporting racist behavior / not speaking out to curb it.

Shane's past racist content & the dan+phil situation were actually the ones recently on top on twitter before he had a meltdown. And it was something he should've addressed instead since it's topical and could salvage some bad PR he was getting from being assoicated with Jeffree. 

The dramageddon stuff is minor compared to that since we were missing the full context of his involvement, plus we really didn't know how he felt about James Charles until the twitter rant."

Although no, I haven't bought his makeup but a friend of mine is a makeup artist so I have had it on my face before, not that you're entitled to an explanation.

Now that that's out of the way, here's stuff on some more queens, which again, some of it is valid, some is just stan Twitter exaggerating and asking for miniscule apologies again

Katya is cancelled for more than just being Trixie's friend, she lipsynced to the n word too 

And could Bob be considered CANCELLEDT for making a Holocaust joke about Jinkx? Which she actually defended with more than just ""it's just a joke at a roast lmfao"" (which is the more fitting response obviously), but with ""Tell me how anitisemitism from black people affects American today. . . I'll wait. . ."" If not let's CANCEL her for being friends with Bianca and Monet alone! Why not!? /s

Trixie was also at the same roast btw and she made the infamous slavery jokes about Latrice there, but I believe you covered it all with ""by being Trixie"" lmao 

Brooke Lynn is cancelled for posing with someone in blackface and just being Bianca del Rio's friend lol, which effectively cancels all queens, Shangela, Dela, Roxxxy Andrews, Detox, Mrs. Kasha Davis, Ongina, Courtney Act, you name it 

Willam, Charlie Hides, and April Carrion did blackface too. They did legit blackface. But now I'm seeing that Kim Chi's neon runway is also being considered semi blackface? Honestly I'm not black so I would like to know more from black people's POV about its appropriateness (or lack thereof), because frankly I didn't clock it as blackface when I saw the episode

Violet is cancelled for [being racist](https://www.instagram.com/p/CBvrWaJpK9w/?igshid=1oveioc31mtqv)

Also just in, Crystal Methyd is CANCELLEDT for posing with the confederate flag for satire lmao

Also Miz Cracker is cancelled for her name lol"

This is the result of taking subversive queer culture and going mainstream... you’re going to get lots of non cookie cutter gays. 

It’s almost like these RPDR fandom stan people are conservative right wingers dictating how queer people get to inhabit space.

Obviously, stuff like assault is inexcusable. Wish folks would just let these girls make their money and chill out, though. There’s literally kids starving in Yemen and bitches wanna pounce on someone for quoting a queer poet who used the word dyke.

And I can't believe how Yvie won, her fashion is very questionable. She says she is this odd queen, but that doesn't mean her looks needed to be this cheap. Like Sharon Needles, she was spooky and odd, but still fashion.

She is this kind of girl that will deliver you the harsh truth. But as she said in the reunion, maybe she just did it to be messy on a reality tv.

And i fell in love with Brooklyn Hytes. He seems a really nice and caring person. I can't believe his romance with Vanjie was real. Brooklyn is so hot out of drag and Vanjie looks like a Gremlin in and out of drag. And they just kept her until the end because of her romance with Brooklyn, she always delivered those ugly bodysuits.

Akeria was none existent except for the drama she instigated. We need to remember you for your talent mawma, not your drama.

And to conclude my season 11 rant, I liked Silky even though she was very annoying. Maybe because she was always fighting with Yvie and I hated her more. But she definitely deserved to be eliminated in her lipsync against Nina. MEH!"

4309,2020-07-06 06:47:21,him0o8,"I vaguely remember reading this too but I remember Serena piping up with supportive comments in Untucked. I think she said something like ""You should feel comfortable wearing girl clothes in the workroom"", and then in their Only Girl in the World lipsync she took Monica's hand at the end and bowed to her, gesturing to Monica as 'The only girl in the world'."
4310,2020-07-02 21:25:46,him0o8,Is this real? I'd fully didn't know this. Omg.
4311,2020-07-06 15:24:19,him0o8,Wouldnt that just .. cancel out the cancelling?
4312,2020-06-30 12:19:43,him0o8,How DARE you?!?
4313,2020-07-13 01:53:51,him0o8,I don't know about that but her comment on Sahara in response to Manila is what briefly got her cancelled
4314,2020-06-30 16:07:29,him0o8,Didn’t she also record herself having sex with a guy without his knowledge and posted it on her OnlyFans?
4315,2020-07-15 18:24:06,him0o8,She trying to feed Nina her feet

4321,2020-06-30 12:56:00,him0o8,She was mean to Nina Bonina Brown. Cancelled FOREVER.
4322,2020-06-30 13:08:17,him0o8,She got arrested with drugs in her car - CANCELLED

4325,2020-07-09 15:30:47,him0o8,"Realistically most of the cancelled comments come from like, a plethora of different age ranges and ethnic backgrounds which is why it's so scary. 15 year old white girls is a bit selective."
4326,2020-07-01 23:32:54,him0o8,Only by Ru
4327,2020-06-30 23:27:26,him0o8,Exactly. Sharon and Shitty Pie deserve to be “cancelled”. The rest are jokes about Stan Twitter
4328,2020-06-30 20:05:47,him0o8,"WHO cares that “people are getting turned off” by anyone! Get lost, you zoomer twat."
4329,2020-07-13 01:57:59,him0o8,"For real, I have some Drag Race mutuals and they DO take all of this seriously

And now they're cancelling Crystal for posing with the confederate flag for satire"
4330,2020-11-06 07:44:54,him0o8,lol yes that’s what we’re gonna cancel Sharon for.
4331,2020-07-12 00:58:13,him0o8,Of course they have lmao
4332,2020-11-05 21:52:30,him0o8,wait what who?
4333,2020-07-12 00:57:48,him0o8,Racist tory

4337,2020-06-30 20:37:31,him0o8,Cancel Eddie Danger for gyrating on people in Hey Qween
4338,2020-07-13 01:59:59,him0o8,"I had to think really hard and Jaida, Bebe, and Shea probably qualify"
4339,2020-07-05 17:34:42,him0o8,Yeah. Listen to early episodes of What’s the Tee and she says all sorts of insane pseudoscience shit.
4340,2020-12-12 09:32:27,him0o8,And that is DISGUSTING. Gay males and nblm have no rights reclaiming this word
4341,2020-07-19 00:28:32,him0o8,A lot of younger generation take offense people weren't born 'woke'. I have been yelled at for admitting I used gay as a insult 2 decades ago. It's a weird world.
4342,2020-11-05 22:00:31,him0o8,"I totally agree. Cancel culture has never been about wanting people to learn from their mistakes. It’s always been about wanting to feel superior to them, or getting “woke” points. It’s funny that people even think these queens care about their opinions."
4343,2020-11-05 21:57:01,him0o8,It’s not.
4344,2020-06-30 12:58:43,him0o8,Omg it’s literally cause she spoke about doing weed in her insta  live and now she’s on the cancel train. But her name is Crystal Methyd... 🤷🏽‍♀️
4345,2020-06-30 12:59:50,him0o8,"I thought she was cancelled for even considering the other Snatch game choice she had. (The one Trixie is cancelled for performing as, which led to Transfat making a performance where she hit a Trixie doll with a walker. And led to anyone else who didn't speak out in support of Transfat as being ableist and cancelled.)... These things are getting hard to follow."
4346,2020-07-13 01:55:07,him0o8,It's because pics of her posing with the confederate flag 3 years ago have emerged. It was for a satire party making fun of the white trash people who actually believe in it.
4347,2020-07-13 02:03:21,him0o8,"I think it's obviously satire, that some fans think they're not just because they bring it up too much 

But no I don't think proof of it being otherwise exists"
4348,2020-07-11 08:47:04,him0o8,??? What nude???
4349,2020-11-05 21:57:18,him0o8,No one. That’s the point.
4350,2020-11-05 21:55:21,him0o8,It’s satire.
4351,2020-07-15 02:52:30,him0o8,"I definitely agree that roast jokes are not cancel-worthy, but that take/defense by Bob, if he really believes it, is more offensive and ridiculous than any joke could be.

 DeSean Jackson of Drag isn't a title you want."
4352,2020-07-02 16:08:51,him0o8,"Honestly I think putting the serious shit next to trivial crap just makes the serious stuff stand out more. The list at the top is what drag race Twitter is like at the moment, and it’s hard to figure out what’s actually going on among all of the “READ THE ROOM” tweets. I think saying it’s invalidating the genuine claims is a reach."
4353,2020-11-05 22:25:57,him0o8,"No. No. No. Jokes are not the same thing as actual HATE. They’re funny BECAUSE they’re so awful. Believe me, I used to feel the same way when I was a teenager (or however old you are, probably younger than me) but you know what happened? I grew up. You have to be able to joke about serious topics, you can’t let them have so much power over you. If you spend your entire life being offended by every little thing, you are going to be MISERABLE."
4354,2020-07-01 06:27:16,him0o8,"I know, it’s hilarious."
4355,2020-11-06 08:04:29,him0o8,The satire comes from comparing the mistakes made by the other queens to the crimes committed by Sharon & Sherry. That’s what makes this list funny.
4356,2020-06-30 17:02:56,him0o8,"I think you need to cancel YOURSELF lol

Edit: Have you noticed that almost every one of these hysterical twinks also posts in r/BeautyGuruChatter ?"
4357,2020-06-30 13:25:20,him0o8,This is satire. We’re poking fun.

4367,2020-07-01 02:59:46,him0o8,Add RuPaul lying to us like that every week to the reasons she's canceled
4368,2020-07-21 10:43:17,him0o8,has anyone he’s said that to actually even won...?
4369,2020-06-30 16:57:07,him0o8,He really does seem to think he’s The Main Judge.

4384,2020-07-03 03:18:37,him0o8,She didn't lmao. Jakeyonce fans  [spread a rumor](https://www.reddit.com/r/RPDRDRAMA/comments/gcxexg/ariel_versace_is_accused_of_sharing_jakeyonce/)  that she and Ariel tweeted his underaged nudes but it was just a retweeted screenshot of a cringy snapchat text.

4386,2020-06-30 19:30:41,him0o8,Didn’t she film a music video during the pandemic? Cancel Vanjie and Brooke too cause they broke up
4387,2020-06-30 12:31:07,him0o8,Yeah I still have sympathy for her condition even if I don't like her. Although I do wonder if somebody involved in her life is making sure she isn't hurting herself by performing constantly
4388,2020-06-30 15:50:22,him0o8,"She's also still crying about being called smelly, further incriminating Ra'jah who keeps getting sent vicious hate so she can fuck off."
4389,2020-07-03 01:33:16,him0o8,"Brooklyn came across as pretty cold to me.  Akeria was exquisite on her season.  Watch the season again and I think you'll appreciate her more.  Yvie was a bit ragged at times, but was fantastic at keeping her brand while doing countless runways.  Yvie slayed the last few episodes especially."
4390,2020-07-02 21:26:32,him0o8,I read it on Instagram years ago and never heard about it again so for all I know it was a lie lol

4397,2020-06-30 21:22:05,him0o8,if literally none of these things would make you like someone slightly less but my comment sets off this reaction from you...then idk what to tell you lol
4398,2020-12-12 10:04:33,him0o8,"Luckily the world is not black and white. If a lesbian is OK with someone using that to refer to them jokingly, then that’s their choice. Not yours"
4399,2020-06-30 15:20:07,him0o8,"Is that it? I saw some frantic teenage drag stans being like ""oh my god Crystal does drugs"" and I was already like... if that's a deal breaker there's probably like 20 queens to choose from who you can stan lmao"
4400,2020-06-30 14:09:44,him0o8,Haha omg the devil's lettuce
4401,2020-07-01 01:11:28,him0o8,"Yes, this is the ""situation"" she is being asked to ""address"". The Twitter teens are scandalized by her drug use and old thirst tweets (lol you are following a 29-year-old gay man who does drag), but the anger is over the... idea of playing Gypsy Rose Blanchard."
4402,2020-06-30 14:08:50,him0o8,Ah that would make sense! I haven't heard anything except people saying she's cancelled. Definatley getting too hard to keep up with
4403,2020-06-30 21:14:20,him0o8,Wait - what is Tricia cancelled for?
4404,2020-07-02 21:27:03,him0o8,Not when Trixie who is actively problematic is chocked up to “just being herself”
4405,2020-11-05 22:37:03,him0o8,This thread is 126 days old Megan I don’t care anymore
4406,2020-07-01 16:39:07,him0o8,"Screenshots can be altered. Are you seriously telling me I should believe an account that was set-up on June 2020 that is only following one person and the only one person they appear to be following is her. This account is a ""witness"" Really... Im not buying that bullshit. 

Thats an even stranger hill to die on but you do you. We've time and time again, when celebs have been accused on something which turns out to be false. James Charles for example."
4407,2020-06-30 15:59:31,him0o8,Yeah she’s cancelled for endangering people whilst drunk driving.
4408,2020-07-01 15:46:09,him0o8,"Yeah that's what threw me from satire to serious, some of these are really serious awful things to put next to jokes"
4409,2020-07-01 23:02:54,him0o8,"Yes I think that is very valid, but also part of the satire since the twitter stans seem to imply that everyone of these queens is just as bad as these 3 and deserve the same treatment"
4410,2020-07-23 00:49:29,him0o8,What’s the T on Sharon? I think I’ve been living under a rock...
4411,2020-06-30 15:13:04,him0o8,THE TIME HAS COME TO DELIMB AND DESTROY
4412,2020-06-30 15:25:42,him0o8,"That’s fair! Also, if there’s no credence, it’s probably best to avoid. Although, there are definitely similar accusations for other queens that are still on the sub lol"
4413,2020-07-24 01:21:20,him0o8,Did you also cancel valentina and the fans for racism against nina or do you just hate black queens that much to go as far as to accuse them of transphobia hmm
4414,2020-07-03 22:13:39,him0o8,"Ooh chile, it’s too horrendous to say. She even flicked the persons vagina afterwards"
4415,2020-07-09 17:14:52,him0o8,Oppalence
4416,2020-07-01 01:34:29,him0o8,"I didn’t see the colon mark in it! I got so scared like “what could anybody be mad at Jaida for?!”😂

Sorry!💛"
4417,2020-07-02 17:48:02,him0o8,I know it’s still early but this a top contender for my favorite comment of the day😂😂
4418,2020-07-03 04:12:20,him0o8,Yeah she lacks charisma. But it was the little things that she did that made me notice that she is a good person. Like asking Yvie to show her her moves and also when she let her piggyride her because of her ankle. That was the thing that won me about her.
4419,2020-07-02 21:34:11,him0o8,"Oh, yeah. It must be a lie. Thanks!"
4420,2020-07-13 02:56:05,him0o8,"It's about 2 things: 

1) A 3 year old picture of the Get Dusted girls dressed as ""white trash"" stereotypes in front of a confederate flag has surfaced. Of course now people on Twitter are saying that she and her friends support the confederate flag. It's obvious that they were not actually supporting the confederate flag, but rather mocking it and its supporters. 

2) And even _thinking_ of doing Gypsy Rose Blanchard for Snatch Game, so she's ableist

You're welcome :)"
4421,2020-06-30 21:38:17,him0o8,"It’s alright, I don’t need you to tell me anything. You’re a teenager lol.

Don’t you have anything better to do than call queens problematic?"
4422,2020-12-12 11:05:52,him0o8,You can't ask every single lesbian if the world if they are okay with you using slurs men have been using against them for ages! So please if you're a male/not lesbian in general please don't use slurs! You have your own slurs to reclaim
4423,2020-06-30 14:54:32,him0o8,Cancel Laganja!

4429,2020-07-09 19:51:12,him0o8,Is she even a drag queen still? I thought she quit
4430,2020-07-01 21:44:14,him0o8,That's what makes it satire.
4431,2020-06-30 15:40:23,him0o8,"Yeah and I should also mention none of these are necessarily things I think queens should be canceled for, just looking at stuff that reddit flipped over in the past (and mostly forgot about) or jokes! Jokes jokes jokes ^jokes."
4432,2020-11-20 20:12:16,him0o8,"lol I’ve heard people say the same thing about a few queens. They’re trolls, don’t believe them."

In fact you seem to be the one ready to jump down people's throats for literally nothing. Unless you're just a kid trying to be immature online for fun? I won't engage further.
4436,2020-12-12 11:06:52,him0o8,How me and my lesbian friends communicate with each other is none of your damn business

4439,2020-07-02 16:51:20,him0o8,"This is very poorly worded. A twitter account made the same month and only following one person doesnt seem legit.. to me anyway. I will awaite to her (Sharon's) response to hear the otherside of the story.

I dont believe a twitter account that appears in the same month as allegations appear, has a little following is real. I am sorry. That is very off, if you want to do believe then you do you. 

""Oh yes in the middle of someone making ALLEGATIONS, a mystery account appears with no following to back it up"" Im sorry that line of logic isnt working for me. 

Sharon has every right just like Alaska and Michelle to rebut these allegations. If their false then an innocent man has been smeared on the internet (which has happened before). If not then Sharon should face the consquences."

Or random twitter accounts thay pop up to ""back her up"" we've seen this happen before.

Ill always stand by the victims and even I could see the BS in her evidence. Its the James Charles effect in full swing. I've seen Sharon compared to Sherry Pie, the difference between Sherry and Sharon is that Sherry admitted to her abuse where as Sharon is going to deal with it. 

Btw Brock Turner's sentence was white privilege in action."

At this point he's using everyone like a pawn in his crude & disgusting chess game. 

He needs to be stopped."
4474,2020-06-30 10:46:05,hikja3,"I have a feeling blaire is backing shane up, making him seem less like an asshole for false allegations. Also in saying she heard the voice memo she played in to jeffrees hand, seeing as he keeps mentioning the mysterious memo he now has some has indirectly backed him up by saying she heard the memo. Bringing the allegations back to life"

I'm not saying he did but it could be a possibility because if the voicemail does come out it I will believe the victim first and foremost.

She said she contacted the victim, now if they are lying to cover Jeffrees arse that is absolutely horrible & a huge kick in the guts to an actual SA victim. 

She put her whole channel on the line & I think if she didn't think there was any substance to it she wouldn't of done the video. Also the fact the both Shane & Jeffree contacted her once she announced she was doing the video seems to me that there is substance to the whole thing."

4485,2020-06-30 12:14:21,hik6nj,Oh wow these are gorgeous
4486,2020-06-30 05:36:10,hifw6j,"Fenty gets praised for focusing on POC because there has been a  significant *dearth* of makeup options for people with darker skin tones; it's not a one to one situation with (shall we say) Almay releasing yet another eyeshadow quad in addition to their entire history of eyeshadow quads that won't show up on anyone darker than an NC25. Fenty, for many beauty lovers, is a long-awaited breath of fresh air. It's an underserved niche versus an oversaturated one.

Additionally, many mainstream beauty brands market their products as universal or all-inclusive when the reality is the exact opposite. People get frustrated because a brand markets their foundation as ""diverse"" when it's just 25 shades of beige, 3 shades of tan, and 2 shades of dark. Or, like in the case of NARS, they try to market ""Orgasm"" as a universally flattering hot peach flush when that shade actually looks like ass on a whole slew of skin tones."
4487,2020-06-30 15:33:02,hifw6j,"IIRC it was Sydney Grace that did this (I could be wrong) but they released two versions of the same palette with a few shades different (ie the bone shade that's in most palettes is different in the darker skin tone one).  

I'd love to see more brands do this."
4488,2020-06-30 07:48:44,hifw6j,"> I believe that companies should be inclusive but I don't have a problem with a product simply not being made for me.

Trophy Wife is a single highlighter in a launch that had something like 8 total highlighters (even more now). This palette is one (1) palette, expected to work for everyone (and was sort of marketed for the ~range~ of ash). I don't follow the comparison you are trying to make with these products, tbh, as Trophy Wife is simply one in a lineup vs the only one of a palette."
4489,2020-06-30 11:39:37,hifw6j,"Products solely targeted at non-POC consumers are heavily criticised for a couple of reasons: 

1. The really obvious one that has already been touched on that there are literally 1000s of products available already for people whose skin is on the milkier side. 
2. Perpetuating the reason for #1, which is the structural racism that excludes (or at least tries to) people with different skin tones from all areas of life. Sure make palettes that are aimed at pale goths, but for goodness sake also make a palette aimed at a dark skinned goth too. Or better still, if you're going to make a palette that is both large in size and as super fucking dramatic as you'd expect a palette for goths to be, make it properly inclusive with shades that cater to a wide range of skin tones. A pale person can wear darker eyeshadows more easily than a darker skinned person can wear pale ones."
4490,2020-06-30 06:21:09,hifw6j,"I am no industry historian, but I do not believe I can remember any non-complexion product releases that drew significant criticism for being better suited to medium to light skin tones. It seems like this particular release was criticized for a multitude of reasons, not chiefly for dark-skin suitability, and only then within the context of the brand owner's track record on race and inclusivity. 

I'm not sure what you are hoping to discuss. It really isn't controversial to put out a eyeshadow palette with sheer or light colors. It happens all the time."
4491,2020-06-30 04:10:56,hifw6j,**Any** brand would have been deservedly criticised for releasing a palette named Cremated in the midst of a pandemic where hundreds of thousands of people have died.
4492,2020-06-30 04:49:27,hifw6j,"Having a targeted audience for a non-complexion product release is perfectly fine. Not every product is meant to be usable by every person; the concept of a ""universally flattering"" makeup product is a marketing lie.

>I got to thinking if the timing wasn’t so atrocious, and this palette wasn't connected to JS and (which I acknowledge and condemn, has been racist in the past, and maybe modern-day [i don't know of any recent instances, but I don't really keep up with it anymore]) would it have gotten the criticism it did? 

Probably not. The extremely specific and extensive criticisms about this release stem from the really dumb timing in that we're in the midst of a global pandemic, and it was released by an infamous person like Jeffree Star. The palette looks like other grey palettes on the market (Lime Crime Immortalis and the Colourpop one immediately come to mind) which were enjoyed by people who like those tones of eyeshadow and passed over with indifference by those who don't. The trouble with eponymous brands is that the reputation and actions of the face of the brand dictate the reputation and reception of the brand itself. See: Kat von D"
4493,2020-06-30 18:24:47,hifw6j,"Name aside, 100% if it wasn't js who released it, it wouldn't have taken the same amount of heat. It's because he has a repeated history of not giving a fuck about POC and this is just another illustrative example. Also a palette that big, he couldn't work in some warm grays?

Also the fucking NAME in the middle of a pandemic?? I think THAT would've been roasted even if it wasn't released by him."
4494,2020-06-30 04:21:22,hifw6j,"I think with eyeshadow, like in your example, it is more understandable than with complexion products. There is a wide variety of eyeshadow palettes to choose from various brands, so it isn’t extremely difficult to find one that suits an individuals needs. Or, for example, there are JS palettes more suitable to POC in his line than Cremated. Grey shades are going to be ashy, because they are emulating ash (duh). But when it comes to products that are specifically for skin and need to match and complement skin color, there is no excuse for excluding a large market demographic. Can’t afford to launch 60 shades? Then at least launch a reasonable fair, light, tan, medium, dark, deep, and deep dark shades at minimum. Idk that’s my opinion anyway. I think if a brand only makes light foundation shades, light eyeshadow palettes, pale blushes etc then I see a problem with that. Neutrogena comes to mind. It’s really a white people brand only. At least with Jeffree Star (putting his past aside), POC can try his formula but not all the products may be suitable for them. Just like his dark highlight shades wouldn’t be suitable for lighter skin tones. Some brands only cater towards white people and the darkest they get is a semi tanned white person shade. Brands like that can do better. I plan to support more black owned brands in the future. I love Juvia’s Place eyeshadow formula. The shimmers are so metallic and pigmented! Other brands should take note!"
4495,2020-07-01 04:34:19,hifw6j,"Because you're not allowed to have a different opinion 🙄. I think it's great that there are more and more releases that cater to a wider range of people. This being said I think it's rude when an eyeshadow is released and people go ""who TF is interested in this it's so ashy""....well there are still a lot of people it could suit. IDC if this comes across a type of way. I never say the inverse of this statement because it's closed minded. We all exist with varying skin colours and there's tons of all of us.  
Ok so I went off tangent but this reminded me of that."
4496,2020-06-30 15:28:22,hifw6j,"I think if this were released at Halloween (when people decorate with things like skeletons and gravestones) it would have been fine.

I actually LIKE the palette.  But I have a dupe for it that is non controversial."
4497,2020-06-30 04:12:19,hifw6j,"the timing was completely wrong, i agree. i’m not trying to defend him."
4498,2020-06-30 04:43:52,hifw6j,"Juvia’s place packaging is gorgeous too! if you like really dramatic/editorial looks Glamorous Cosmetics has some beautiful bright colored false eyelashes, i legit can’t wait to purchase once my budget allows it :)"
4499,2020-06-30 04:35:34,hifw6j,"i agree with you wholeheartedly, certain products have certain audiences. and brands should absolutely do their damn hardest to be as diverse as possible and be held accountable when they don’t. if a small(ish) company like beautybakerie can afford to have a large range in foundations then large corporations should be able to too."
4500,2020-06-30 18:26:16,hifw6j,"I like the concept of a gray cool toned palette but not one that big

Like I was mad interested in the Venus Immortalis palette but I'm wary of spending that much money on it. Also looking at Make Obsessions Black is the New Black cuz its $10"
4501,2020-06-30 04:13:41,hifw6j,"It seems like you have answered your own question? Yes, the timing was absolutely wrong and that is why the palette was criticised."
4502,2020-06-30 18:57:55,hifw6j,"I believe it is now discontinued, but the Primark Cool Smoke (Sadly not available online) is a good dupe for Cremated (but 12 shade).

I love everything about the palette.  The quality isn't perfect but it is worth the $7 price point."
4503,2020-06-30 04:15:48,hifw6j,"it was also criticized on the shades too and that’s what my focus was, sorry for not specifying."

4526,2020-06-30 03:23:51,hibluw,"I’ve found it annoying when he covers “news” that involve minor controversy amongst celebrities on social media and cancel culture. I can’t tell when he’s either hopping on the bandwagon or is actually interested and wants to share convos about the topics he brings to the table. 

Often he’ll cover a topic involving outrage towards a person for something pretty pointless to draw more attention to. He’ll bring up Twitter statements and tell us where the people stand on the subject and he often ends it with “my thoughts on this... idgaf this is silly” I wonder how much power the audience sending him topics has on the PDS. 

Also, I find it amusing that he’s praised Shane in the past numerous times for his content and has dubbed him one of the great youtubers whilst knowing his problematic past. I guess Phil really is into the beauty (tea) culture..."
4527,2020-06-30 20:18:06,hibluw,I wish he would cover the whole FBE thing. I'd be more interested in his opinion on that than Shane.
4528,2020-06-30 00:29:44,hibluw,"This time it's warranted. It's now on the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/style/shane-dawson-jeffree-star-youtube.html). Even before the Smiths called him out on twitter, Shane's content on sexualizing minors going viral was worthy of commentary or at least coverage. I can understand if Phil didn't know or had blinders on because they are friends. 

But the last time similar controversies it got brought up Defranco helped reform Shane's image and swept it all under the rug. And Phil called the first one a [witch hunt](https://youtu.be/W4DnmTEHQug) and the [other a ridiculous made up shock story](https://youtu.be/jXiMRecJHHk). Guess everyone had to see the videos and photos to believe it themselves."
4529,2020-06-30 21:23:45,hibluw,"I can't find a source so take this with a grain of salt, but Phil has mentioned that he consults for youtubers sometimes and he definitely worked with Shane in the past (I think Phil let it slip in a video when there was some controversy a few years ago). A lot of us viewers think he promotes Shane because, the better Shane does, the better Phil does."
4530,2020-06-30 00:04:45,hibluw,"Phil seems to go on a pattern.  He covers YouTube entertainment news, world news, local US news, controversial news, and then the stuff that interests him.  It’s random which topic he covers but in a given month, each topic seems to be covered equally.  Major topics (like covid) being the exception.

It may be we notice these more than the others because we expect the others.  Usually it’s the stuff we don’t expect that gets highlighted."
4531,2020-06-30 01:03:22,hibluw,"I feel that this is still different from a lot of other similar stories though. Frankly I'm surprised that Shane lost any subs from this. Is there anyone who has follow Shane to any degree since the earlier days that was surprised by any of these revelations? I haven't followed him for several years now but I did watch some of his stuff way back even if I don't remember a lot of it. There's not a whole lot that could be ""exposed"" from those early days that I wouldn't respond with ""yeah that sounds about right."""
4532,2020-06-30 08:43:06,hibluw,"These people make good thumbnails so even if they aren’t a big part of the episode either they’re often very noticeable. Compared to world news which is hardly ever thumbnail material.

 Plus he’s been having so much trouble with suppression covering real stories, wouldn’t surprise me if that subconsciously pushes him to less intense drama stories sometimes"
4533,2020-06-30 01:11:02,hibluw,"The part that he changed channels and content gained him new subscribers like me who was unaware of his past, at least not to this extent. 

His old fans are sharing stories how they didn't realize it's fucked up because they were still in middle school when they first started watching Shane. Even during his meet & greets and Tanacon his fans were mostly underaged girls. People didn't process it until much later."
4534,2020-06-30 17:27:26,hibluw,I think this is very likely a logical explanation for the current situation
4535,2020-06-30 01:20:21,hibluw,"Oh shit I forgot about the channel switch, fair point. Looks like he's removed just about everything from the original channel too."
4536,2020-06-29 19:13:11,hi6er4,it's no wonder joffrey and shame became fast friends. their values overlap perfectly!
4537,2020-06-29 21:27:34,hi6er4,"i think it’s funny you called him Jeff lol 

but yeah he’s a shitty person always has been"
4538,2020-07-01 17:34:48,hi6er4,"Jeffree is a horrible, vile, disgusting human being (if he's even human. He claims to be alien, ha! That was a joke.).
Just think about all the people he has tried to ruin in the past. MannyMUA, Laura Lee and James Charles, to name just a few! Now Shane. Shane does have bad things in his past and is maybe still bad, I'm not taking up for him, but becoming friends with Jeffree is like making a deal with the devil. 

The thing is, after he turns on people and they are no longer friends with him, they never say why, and that means something. For someone reason, these people are either not allowed or are to scared to say why they are no longer friends with him. He's bad. He's benefitting from this someway, I just don't know how. Or maybe he just enjoys ruining people."
4539,2020-06-29 19:27:16,hi6er4,It makes me sad but I can’t defend what Shane has done and what he’s continuing to do. It’s about time people exploded on him. BUT while we’re at it... let’s take a look at Jeff shall we...👀?
4540,2020-06-29 21:48:52,hi6er4,Haha too lazy to say his whole name.
4541,2020-07-01 19:51:30,hi6er4,"Man the more I read about him the scarier it gets. I can’t imagine what he has or does to people to keep them from speaking up for themselves after their takedowns. 

Here’s Morphe’s contact email to send them a complaint about Jafar if you’re interested. 

info@morphebrushes.com 

It’s worth something."
4542,2020-06-29 21:49:47,hi6er4,honestly the fact that nobody spells Jeff/Jeffree/Jeffrey (or however else) consistently
4543,2020-06-29 17:02:40,hi2vh3,Shane did this behavior before him and Jeffree ever crossed paths.
4544,2020-06-29 17:00:14,hi2vh3,"THIS^^^^!

I remember when Shane first started hanging out with J*, the first thought I had was that he would eventually come to regret it! It seems like every person that gets close to J* ends up in some kind of big controversy and then they don't  hang with Jeffery anymore, without anybody really knowing why, then they lose a lot of fans. Even Nathan left. We'll never know the truth about that, either.

Edit: Sorry if part of this shows up italicized. Not sure how that happened."
4545,2020-06-29 17:30:00,hi2vh3,"Except all this was before Jafar.

4552,2020-06-29 16:08:48,hi2o22,"Well, I was shopping in Walmart the other day, (with the intent of buying all of their guns, bacon and American flags) when I spotted a Mooslem running frantically up and down through the aisles, and his name was Abdul-Mohammed-Jamal-Jabar-Steve-Jabar-Omar-Abdul. I was certain at any moment he would yell 'Allah Akbar'. Thankfully, my shopping cart was full of bacon (which as you all know, is Mooslem kryptonite). So I straightened my MAGA hat and pulled up my Confederate flag britches and grabbed a pack of bacon from my cart. I took that Mooslem over my knee and spanked his ass with the bacon while screaming 'Liberalism is a mental disorder!' over and over. Then, by the power of the bacon,  Abdul-Mohammed-Jamal-Jabar-Steve-Jabar-Omar-Abdul instantly converted to Christianity and registered as a Republican. Trump showed up and awarded me the Medal of Honor because I probably stopped the next 9/11.

4560,2020-06-29 16:35:19,hi2f6h,"His rant was infuriating. I'm aware that its comedy and intended to be a bit.

But to say something along the lines of ""how are people getting paid to do makeup l"" and ""its makeup what is so important""

....how is getting on camera and talking about makeup any different than getting up on a stage and doing a comedy routine? At some point a comedian has to be narcissistic enough to persue comedy. It's literally the fucking same.

also ESPECIALLY considering Tim Dillion is gay, some of this rant came off as incredibly transphobic. I'm aware than Jeffree is not trans and that Jeffree doesnt really have preferred pronouns, but to say ""he, she, whatever it is"" and shit like that. Tim is in the LGBTQ community and should know better.

Also I'm sorry but have the wherewithal to realize that the fuse to this whole thing was Shane leaving a community he wasnt apart of, so maybe Tim shouldnt make comments or at least make an effort to better understand a community he knows nothing about before he comments."
4561,2020-06-29 17:33:27,hi2f6h,"Dear not-funny comedian,

Why is makeup important? 

How do you think Jeffrey Star could afford to buy Saturn? 

It's because of the money. Makeup is a hugely lucrative industry. Duh. 

HTH,

4562,2020-06-29 13:58:38,hhzgg6,Shane isn’t hot enough for Jeffree. Just gonna say it like it is.
4563,2020-06-29 15:59:39,hhzgg6,"To specifically go to number 4.

He has predated upon, he has sexually exploited, and sexualised minors. He doesn't have to had physically molested anyone for those to be through. As for the household, his mother joined in on the blackface racism and the predation and sexualisation of a minor, the omegle video, his aunt allowed him to sexually exploit and sexualise his cousin. Here's a list of him sources of him being predatory, sexualising minors and exploiting them sexually, and one where he calls himself a paedo.

4564,2020-06-29 13:59:33,hhzgg6,"1) nothing. he's done. mainstream media has picked up the story and the smith family and other real celebrities are speaking up against him. people are calling for an investigation against him bc of all the predatory behavior he's exhibited towards children. his career is over.

2) he's not a helpless innocent victim of his parents. he was and still is a grown man capable of making his own decisions. racism isn't a coping mechanism. 

3) given how many times people have tried to cancel him i'd be surprised if ryland didn't know about his past, and that's a big if. he's surrounded himself with racists who he calls ""his family"" so i don't believe for a minute that ryland's unaware.

4) he's called himself a pedophile multiple times, has joked about having cp on his computer, is predatory towards children (predominantly his fans), has been inappropriate with his OWN underage cousin, and the list goes on. it's fucking gross.

5) if they're going to break up i can see it happening over the fact that their adoption plans are over after all the predatory shit that's come out about shame. afaik they both want to adopt but i don't see any reputable and sane adoption agency looking favorably on shame as a potential parent after doing one google search on him."
4565,2020-06-29 15:18:46,hhwzal,"Don't take Jenna's agency from her. Yes, people were bringing up extremely old videos, and yes, she addressed them and apologized. But she wasn't bullied or pushed off the platform -- she made a choice to leave, one that was most likely a long time coming anyway. I agree that cancel culture is often out for blood and leaves people with little room to improve (how can you grow when each mistake is a reason for you to be torn down forever?), but this was not a Johnny Depp case. A few people asked for apologies, likely unaware that she has spoken about it before, and that was it. Everything else was Jenna and only Jenna.

Jenna herself flat out said that *she* wants the break, that she doesn't feel the channel accurately represents her anymore -- and that's true. As a fan, it's easy for us to look at the past two or three years and say how different she is from where she started, but imagine that you see a Jenna video now and decide to start from the beginning. You're going to come across a bunch of stuff that isn't the same, with a person who doesn't look, sound or act very much like the plant tour or Elder Scrolls tour lady. You're going to see stuff that was questionable even ten years ago. It's a *lot*, and she has every right to say, ""Hey, I was Jenna Marbles for a long time, but now I'm just Jenna Mourey and that's what I want to be."" We've been speculating for six months, give or take, that her enthusiasm was waning. That she seemed tired and done. That quarantine just killed whatever she had left.

Personally, I think Jenna just saw an opportunity to step back at the same time she was apologizing, and that's okay. We got more than ten years of her content, and it's time for her to breathe without worrying about us. It's time for her and Julien to focus on themselves, on their futures. One thing I've been thinking about is what they've put on hold in order to be as open and constant as they have been. We know for a fact that they never took a real vacation together until *last year*. They can afford to, they have the ultimate flexibility, and yet they never did, because they put their focus on multiple weekly videos, on the podcast, on their many other ventures. Jenna likes to have everything extremely planned out, and it's possible they've put all *kinds* of things on hold in the name of continuing their brand.

They need space, and as fans, it's the least we can give them. It hasn't even been a week. We can hold each other up and rewatch the hundreds (thousands? I don't even know) of videos they've left us. We can reminisce and welcome newcomers to the Dink Fam, and I'm sure Julien will be back sooner rather than later. Aries Kitchen will come back, we'll see peeks of Jenna and the dogs. Jenna will return if and when she wants to.

Until then, Dink Fam will go on, and we have to be okay with it."
4566,2020-07-01 13:46:35,hhwzal,"No one brought up old videos, she did that herself. She wanted out and decided to go out with a bang. Dont play into white women victimhood"
4567,2020-06-29 17:59:32,hhwzal,"I absolutely agree, as a fan I want her to look after herself and do whatever’s best for her. I think me saying that people bullied her off YouTube was definitely not the best way to put it. Although I do believe that any hate she’s gotten will have factored into her decision like the straw that broke the camels back but It was her choice, she could’ve just done what a lot of YouTubers do and either ignore it and hope the majority of people just don’t realise or hear about it or post a notes app apology and go right back to posting videos. There’s no excuse for racism and I know what you mean about imagining a new fan watching her more recent videos and going back the the beginning. Ten years is an incredible amount of time to invite the world into your home and I can’t imagine the stress that causes and although I’ll miss her I would never want her to come back solely for her fans sakes. If she’s not feeling it anymore there’s not a lot she can do about it except leave and find something that makes her happy."

What the fuck did you just fucking say to me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little ""clever"" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.

Me when I see 420 and funny secks number (420): WOW kid you just got R/WOOOOOOSHED!!!! 😂😂👀

""Wooosh"" means you didn't get the joke, as in the sound made when the joke ""woooshes"" over your head. I bet you're too stupid to get it, IDIOT!! 😤😤😂

My joke was so thoughtfully crafted and took me a total of 3 minutes, you SHOULD be laughing. 🤬 What's that? My joke is bad? I think that's just because you failed. I outsmarted you, nitwit.🤭

In conclusion, I am posting this to the community known as ""R/Wooooosh"" to claim my internet points in your embarrassment 😏. Imbecile. The Germans refer to this action as ""Schadenfreude,"" which means ""harm-joy"" 😬😲. WOW! 🤪 Another reference I had to explain to you. 🤦‍♂️🤭 I am going to cease this conversation for I do not converse with simple minded persons.😏😂

Welcome to Team Fortress 2. After nine years in development, hopefully it will have been worth the wait. To listen to a commentary node, put your crosshair over the floating commentary symbol and press your primary fire. To stop a commentary node, put your crosshair over the rotating node and press your primary fire again. Some commentary nodes may take control of the game in order to show something to you. In these cases, simply press your primary fire again to stop the commentary. In addition, your secondary fire will cycle you through all the commentary nodes in the level. Please let me know what you think after you have had a chance to play. I can be reached at gaben@valvesoftware.com, and my favorite class is the Spy. Thanks, and have fun!

4621,2020-06-28 23:58:40,hhp30v,"Him losing his career because he built it on bigotry won't ruin his life...it will ruin his career.  If Shane took his apology seriously, and truly believes he ""should be punished"" or that he should've lost everything...........then why not. He can redeem himself without staying in the public eye for the rest of his life.

Edit: Just to point out, in any normal career path, someone WOULD probably lose their career over these things."
4622,2020-06-29 00:09:02,hhp30v,"it is absolutely wild to me that you're saying jaden etc shouldn't have made their reaction public. SHANE made the video public. he put it all in public, online, and that's where he's being judged. *he* decided that. why do they have to respect him when he has been so astoundingly disrespectful to a child who was *eleven years old* at the time and published it for everyone to see?

you're saying jokes aren't an indicator. okay, but the thing is, there are real people involved. i can only imagine how sick and upset and violated i'd feel if i was willow smith, or the other young girls he's made inappropriate jokes about or with on camera with a million viewers laughing along. i can't imagine what it would be like to be franchesca ramsey (or whoever he claims that fantasy was about) and listen to him talking about a graphic violent power fantasy he had about me. these are real people he's affected. even if it's jokes. it is just as bad if it's jokes: to be so dehumanised by someone that their laughter is more important than the pain they're causing you. that is humiliating. that is devastating.

death threats are too far, yeah, but why shouldn't he lose his career? of course he should lose his career. anyone else would lose their job, in any other industry, for even a fraction of the things he's done. he isn't special. he isn't exempt from the rules of society. and it's worse for him, in fact, because this isn't like some guy who works in a store and then on his off-time went and posted something racist that got him fired. he built his entire success off of the pain caused by blackface and child molestation jokes and involving genuine real life children in his ""comedy"" and transphobia and antisemetic jokes, he literally would not have the career he has without  that, and you know this, you understand that this is all wrong. as long as his youtube career is standing then it is standing on the foundations of someone else's pain, of *so* many other people's pain. people keep telling us to think about what this is doing to shane, but what is shane's ongoing success doing to all the human beings *he's* hurt? he was given a platform and he abused it for years. he does not deserve to keep it. he's got plenty of money to survive off, i will not be sad because he can't keep living out his cash-grabbing ego trip."
4623,2020-06-28 23:50:43,hhp30v,"Bullying is bad, but thinking that his career should be perfectly fine is a bit...yikes"
4624,2020-06-29 01:03:48,hhp30v,"I also remember Shane being uncomfortable watching musically, he was saying that children there are sexualized and this is not ok. I think he also asked his young followers not to send him nudes.
I don't support him, his posts were 100% inappropriate, but I don't think he is actually a pedophile"
4625,2020-06-28 23:55:57,hhp30v,"I did read what you wrote. My prediction is that, as time passes, more and more people will agree with you. I think viewers like the idea that people can be redeemed and change. I assume he's going to lay low for quite some time, but I would be surprised if whatever he posts next does not address these current events and this issue directly. Honestly, time will tell, and it's all very unknown right now."
4626,2020-06-29 00:19:32,hhp30v,"Stopppppppppppppp shielding predators oh my god. If you saw the video with his cousin & don’t think they were predatory, you’re AT BEST kidding yourself. If you are not *sick to your stomach* after seeing all the videos (of the RACISM AND PEDOPHILIC BULLSHIT), you are AT BEST not a well-adjusted adult."
4627,2020-06-29 00:05:53,hhp30v,"No, he should lose his career. He should have lost it a long time ago. People go to the extreme of saying the internet is bullying him to suicide. That is not what’s happening. I am active on social media and I haven’t seen any death threats, and if those people exist, they’re in the minority. 

You are softly defending him. I recognize it because until just yesterday I had hope he could grow. But he hasn’t shown he is capable of that. He took two opportunities this past week to apologize and they both failed. He has had a decade of chances to try to make things right and he hasn’t. I also get the feeling you are not as offended by racism than others are.

I would rather focus my energy on creators who don’t have as many issues. Imagine the top YouTuber being someone who hasn’t done blackface?! That time is within our grasp."

His ""hard work"" relied heavily on racism/pedophilia/etc....

He is a multi millionaire, sorry I just have a hard time believing the fact that him not being able to be a YouTuber anymore would be so terrible. He can go travel or get a new hobby or something lol."
4635,2020-06-28 23:56:20,hhp30v,"Because he still didn’t take accountability. He shirked responsibility and blamed it on other things. On top of that, mistakes are one thing but repeated misbehaviors is another. There’s a difference between dark jokes that are still funny and pretending to jack off to a poster of an 11 year old. On top of that, he still supports racist bullies and his helping them. He just last year was complicit in allegations against James Charles and did nothing and even then his statement last week still defended Jeffree and put down James. The point is hes not showing signs of changing at all. “I’m willing to lose everything I have”, then why buy twitter followers as you’re losing them, why delete comments calling you out (which are not bullying comments). He’s not taking accountability. The apology only happened because of Jenna. Maybe he’s not putting out blatantly racist content but his behavior is still problematic. In the end I think if he shows genuine signs of changing maybe things will work out, but he’s not at all right now."

I’ll be really sure to handhold people who shield predators in future so I don’t hurt their feelings by calling them out."
4638,2020-06-29 00:00:55,hhp30v,Because there is no valid point to defend what he’s said/done.

4640,2020-06-28 23:58:30,hhp30v,I 100000% disagree with the bullying. But with all his actions and what he does it’s hard to believe he’s changed for the good. Any normal individual would be finished career wise if they did 1/88439593948th of what he did but he’s okay? How does that make sense?

4644,2020-06-29 00:45:01,hhp30v,"He wouldn't lose a chance to redeem himself by leaving YouTube. He'd be losing the opportunity to redeem himself publicly, sure, but it's hard to believe that anyone would think his redemption is genuine after the way his previous attempts at redemption seemed incredibly disingenuous. If anything, him working on himself privately, without anyone watching and critiquing, seems like the best possible option. 

Shane Dawson ending does not mean Shane Yaw also ends, he needs to fix himself as a person, not as a public figure."
4645,2020-06-29 00:16:51,hhp30v,"The point is his “apology” most likely would NOT have happened if it werent for her. It wasn’t even genuine and it was after he got backlash for that shitty twitter statement. Taking accountability isn’t “I have childhood trauma depression and anxiety and I was in the closet”. These things he did are borderline pedophilic and flat out racist. If a normal person like you or me did this in our work place (as he did) we’d be finished. Imagine going into an office and doing what he did, like a person would be fired and most likely investigated and ruined. Same if someone showed up to work in blackface repeatedly. I don’t think it’s justifiable at all and you didn’t really address any of my other points proving that he’s not taking responsibility. You fuck up repeatedly/knowingly = career ruined. That’s how it is for everyone. If he changes for better we’ll see where it foes but so far he hasn’t. A business contract is different. James dropped Jeffrees merch company as soon as everything happened to him. Shane still chooses to defend Jeffree and he doesnt need to do that."
4646,2020-06-29 00:56:00,hhp30v,"I... literally didn’t insult you. I said “IF those videos didn’t make you sick, you’re not a well-adjusted adult”. The only way it would be an “insult” (again... really??) would be if it were true that the videos didn’t make you feel physically sick & if you didn’t find them to be predatory. It’s *not* my fault if you fulfilled that prophecy."
4647,2020-06-29 01:01:53,hhp30v,"Well you’re defending someone who sexualizes underage girls, so in my books you do deserve to be insulted."

4649,2020-06-29 00:30:36,hhp30v,"Also, it’s not your place to say Jada/Jaden shouldn’t have made their reaction public. It was completely justified. That is a grown ass man sexualizing their young daughter/brother. They have every right to be pissed and vocal about it. It’s not on them if assholes are gonna comment violent shit."
4650,2020-06-29 00:30:38,hhp30v,[deleted]
4651,2020-06-29 00:55:11,hhp30v,"I think people wanting him to lose his platform isn't solely about him not getting more chances, it's about the message that is sent when people (quite often, white men) do bad shit and get to come out of it relatively unscathed because they've ""apologized"" and ""redeemed"" themselves. An apology does not mean that there are no consequences. 

Shane has repeatedly said that his dream job is to be a filmmaker, not a Youtuber. We can't speculate the value that he places in YouTube as a job, he doesn't even put out content frequently. I understand what you're saying, but I just don't think that it's a fair argument considering no one here knows him personally and therefore no one can assume that Youtube is the purpose of his life."
4652,2020-06-29 00:32:42,hhp30v,"I mean if you say so. I’m just gonna agree to disagree. The reason imo his apology isn’t genuine is him still supporting these people and not taking accountability for the James situation when days before he defended Jeffree and shat on James. He only apologized for it cause people got pissed and called him out. Additionally, he’s deleting valid comments so"

4657,2020-06-28 22:49:40,hho3qg,"You definitely make some valid points.  But I think it's important to note that she is touching on multiple issues at once in her video, and that one issue doesn't negate the other.  Saying the receipts are real doesn't negate the fact that J* is wrongfully sharing this info with people, nor does it negate the racist and other stuff he's done. She probably should've thought this through a bit more, but I don't think her video was expressly in the wrong. But idk, those are just my musings on it."
4658,2020-06-28 23:28:09,hho3qg,"Ok so I’m not the only one confused af. I’m like ok Jeffree is a monster for using the evidence but to me it’s more damning for James so.. I’m like unless this is also a slam against James she totally fucked up because now everyone is looking at James AGAIN. No ones surprised by Jeffree s involvement sadly lol. 

I haven’t seen the video yet and of course all accusations are alleged at this point"
4659,2020-06-28 23:57:37,hho3qg,"I thought the purpose of the video was to both paint Jeffree in a bad light (but obviously no one's surprised lol) and warn people that maybe he was right regardless, I mean you can do both? Also probably indirectly wanted to defend Shane/remind people of who's the monster, especially if James ends up being guilty."
4660,2020-06-29 01:04:26,hho3qg,"There is SO many holes in the story that doesn’t make sense. She first starts off saying j* is manipulative and even Manipulated her to not speaking out with the Dahvie shit but she later found out he lied But then says this memo is very credible even tho is came from the man she just said was manipulative. I wouldn’t be going on the internet with this information but to the police. She posted on Instagram “J* release your receipts to get the heat off my friends (shane) back” so, she was okay with him outing a victim if it got the heat of Shane’s back? If this recording is so disgusting as they say wouldn’t she tell him to release it to the police instead of worrying more about clearing Shane’s name. She was more worried about Shane’s Reputation then the alleged victim of JC. 

Some might say they didn’t release it to the police because the victim didn’t want to but jeffree was showing to many youtubers that the information could have been leaked anyway. If they cared about protecting the victim they wouldn’t have played it to people, went on a podcast talking about it or saying the victim was a YouTuber letting people speculate. 

The whole video made JC look like a monster and J* right for attacking him. I don’t really understand the point of the video."
4661,2020-06-29 00:29:13,hho3qg,She made Jeffree the antagonist if anything 💀 Look at the damn thumbnail and title
4662,2020-06-29 03:36:16,hho3qg,Or perhaps her entire video is a smokescreen to hide the REAL person we should be focused on. Shane. The timing and her confusing ramblings just seem a little to perfect for me. But idk. Who cares. It'll all come out in the wash eventually.
4663,2020-06-28 23:10:50,hho3qg,"Third parties can report a crime. Police can investigate without a victim’s consent. James can’t sue Jeffree for saying something if it’s true. Nobody knows if lawyers actually got involved. 

Jeffree is absolutely at fault for telling everyone about this voice memo and playing it for random people. He even insinuated on Mom’s Basement that it’s not a first-person account, but someone telling a story about james and someone else. Nothing has been verified. Blaire did not get confirmation from a victim. Her video adds nothing to the james part."
4664,2020-06-29 01:04:35,hho3qg,Honestly I’m not a fan of James but he should be making a law suit against everyone and their mother for slander.
4665,2020-06-29 22:05:33,hho3qg,"Just because Jeffree might have a credible source, does not change the terrible, terrible things he’s done and that he’s using this “proof” as a way to manipulate people. Once again, Jeffree has sexually assaulted men, posted revenge porn, and has been buddies with pedophiles, even going so far as to be aware of what Dahvie was doing when they were friends. And what we do know is that whilst the proof might seem credible to Blaire, until this gets taken to court, we don’t know yet if or what it is. We know Jeffree has a history of keeping dirt on people, we know Jeffree is problematic and incredibly money hungry. He does not care who he hurts, so long as he comes out looking like the better man and unfortunately, all of you people keep giving him chance after chance to explain himself when ALLS he does is lie."
4666,2020-06-30 04:44:02,hho3qg,"Idk, I see Blaire as a troll and an instigator. She loves drama in her own way and I'm not surprised she's found her way into this mess especially considering it's blown out of just the beauty community this time. I'm not sure I believe anybody who's that married to controversy. Besides, she shouldn't have asked or accepted to listen to the victim's statements. It's vile that anybody outside of the victim's trusted circle knows about this incident. Also, why a voice recording? What an odd piece of evidence to have. Did Jeffree ask this person to repeat their statements into a microphone or something? What reason did he give for asking to record them? This leads me to believe that he either got the recording without consent, fabricated what was on the recording or is lying about having one all together. Evident from his past, Jeffree loves having information others don't and using it to control other people. I find it awfully convenient he seems to be the only person with such specific and mysterious evidence."
4667,2020-06-28 23:01:47,hho3qg,"I also think there were some valid points in here. However then you got to the part where James involved lawyers and what not to silence Jeffree. Silence him where? Maybe to actually say the words that James actually did something or what? Because J* is STILL showing everyone these “receipts”, and everyone on the outside world is left confused like what’s going on? They made all of this public in the first place and now they have a bunch of people wondering about the facts as well. If J* really was silenced then he wouldn’t be doing all this shit rn. Everyone is being so shady and half ass and nothing is making sense. I believe Blaire is just sick of J* dangling horrible accusations around without no proof or further steps. Also i think she got upset because now Shane got all the heat from his statement and his past and she was like oh get it off him. I honestly think they ALL have their own shit to deal with and it all ended up being mixed into one big mess, and it all seems connected. Everyone (J,S&T) should just stop acting clueless and clear all this shit up. It all just keeps getting bigger and bigger. What is worse? Have the hate keep growing and be cancelled for a loooong time? Or get it off your chest and clear shit up and probably still be canceled, but take accountability and show that you are a changed person and you can be REAL not shady."
4668,2020-06-28 23:52:02,hho3qg,She wants people to be looking at James too in case he actually molested someone
4669,2020-06-29 02:47:57,hho3qg,"Everyone who keeps saying that the people who’ve heard the voice memos should go to the police - what do you think the police would do in this situation exactly? “I heard a voice memo from someone I barely know and don’t trust that is supposedly of someone else I don’t know personally saying that another person I don’t know personally molested them. The victim doesn’t want to press charges though.”

Its extremely hard to get police to take you seriously even if you’re the victim, let alone this."
4670,2020-06-29 17:27:28,hho3qg,Blaire made a series of tearful insta stories about Shane immediately afterwards. I only found out about the Shane thing because of that. So no I don’t think she’s concealing anything.
4671,2020-06-29 02:17:23,hho3qg,"Sexual assault is an EXTREMELY difficult accusation to prove in court, which is why many victims don't want to come forward. It's even more difficult to prove in the court of public opinion. 

James has probably known about this voice recording for ages and even if it's true I am 100% certain James will have prepared an absolute slam dunk of a video rebutting everything the victim says. Public opinion is on James' side right now. People want to see Jeffree and Shane torn down, not James. 

James has a massive upper hand. If it's true, I don't blame the alleged victim for not coming forward. I sure as hell wouldn't."
4672,2020-06-29 02:37:16,hho3qg,Unless it's true.... which may be why this hasn't happened yet
4673,2020-06-29 03:30:19,hho3qg,Seems to me she's just stirring the shit pot while the turds are fresh for them views... I don't trust any of those bottom feeder parasites.
4674,2020-06-29 03:21:26,hho3qg,It is better than sitting around doing nothing or dangling around the internet. If you cared about an alleged victim you would try to do something for them or not speak on it all. They are both using this victims story for their own benefit.
4675,2020-06-29 03:32:20,hho3qg,"If I were the victim and I very specifically did not want my story told nor to go to the police, I would be livid if someone I didn’t even know went to the police for me. I do absolutely agree of course that it shouldn’t be spread around like gossip, and I don’t agree with anyone’s approach to this right now honestly."
4676,2020-06-28 22:18:13,hhnnkd,"Jeffree is the least of Shane's worries right now. What Shane needs to worry about is how he pissed off The WILL SMITH's Men In Black, Fresh Prince iconic famous legendary guy's family."
4677,2020-06-28 22:22:38,hhnnkd,"I understand that business is business and there are probably legal contract regarding his business relationship with Jeffree Star. HOWEVER, Business relationships and Personal Relationships are not the same thing. Distancing himself from Jeffree Star would help. Even if it’s just the personal relationship, for now."
4678,2020-06-28 22:55:16,hhnnkd,"I think most contracts have a morality clause, right? Like, if one party does something truly unscrupulous then the other part can bow out with penalty? I would hope that to be the case for Jeffree and Shane."
4679,2020-06-28 23:38:02,hhnnkd,"If they could've they would've by now. 

they are both so into each other and think they are both sooooooo great that they will never cut each other out."
4680,2020-06-28 23:47:03,hhnnkd,"He could have publicly distanced himself from Jeffree. He could have not reiterated, numerous times, that Jeffree is ""family."" Your business partners aren't family. If he had said in his Twitter diatribe, ""Jeffree does bad stuff and I've talked to him about it, and I hear you all and won't keep giving him a pass,"" he probably wouldn't be in the catastrophic situation he's currently in."
4681,2020-06-28 22:19:28,hhnnkd,"Agreed. This has fully entered mainstream celebrity gossip now, not just Internet drama. Even if he truly changed, I think it's too late."
4682,2020-06-28 22:38:42,hhnnkd,"Agreed, I definitely think this is the scariest part for him right now. People who had never heard of him before are seeing all of those now and lighting their torches and readying their pitchforks."
4683,2020-06-28 22:23:29,hhnnkd,"It seems like he's starting to do that, like I mentioned in his apology he wouldn't even say anyone's name. But definitely agree. It's awkward to distance yourself from someone you're working with without direct slander."
4684,2020-06-29 04:14:29,hhnnkd,"In this case it was shane that did the truly unscrupulous doings. So if jeffree decides to pull him from his brand over this without legal repercussions than good! He almost has no choice but to pull his name and merch. It would be career suicide not too. This has gone mainstream. Jeffree has a lot of customers that extend from youtube. Some of his customers have admitted they never watch it. Now that Shane has went prime time, everyone will knows about it. Friendship will not factor into jeffrees decision. It can't. Love him or hate him, you cant deny that he has built his empire from nothing and has turned it into a massively popular cosmetic company. He's not going to risk that. Nor should he. A lot of this stuff, although done years ago, has just recently been revealed. Some of it is probably a shock to jeffree as it was for us. It's gonna be a PR nightmare for him! Idk. I guess i can't blame him for doing whatever needs to be done to protect his business."
4685,2020-06-28 22:31:15,hhn07o,"Well Jeffree essentially hired Shane to clean up his public image for the first series.

Jeffree has always been problematic.

Then the second series it was about making bank. And they did that. But also were involved in orchestrating drama to sell their stupid eyeshadow.

Jeffree dragged Shane into his problematic world. But we all turned a blind eye to the fact that Shane was also problematic."
4686,2020-06-29 03:14:03,hhn07o,"People, stop acting like J* is the one who made Shane problematic. He has been problematic for over ten years."
4687,2020-06-28 21:48:50,hhn07o,"I believe that J* is actively plotting against Shane now. People ask why Shane’s problematic content is a problem now, when it’s been out there for a decade? It’s because there needed to be a perfect storm to shift public opinion. 

Evidence: BW’s video was clearly pro-Jeffree; videos and podcast clips have been coming out at a steady pace, almost as if someone is guiding their release; and A list celebrities are coming out against Shane, which is unusual because Hollywood and YT don’t typically overlap.

I want to make it clear I’m not defending Shane. He should have gone down for this a long time ago. I do think this take down is orchestrated by J* though."
4688,2020-06-28 23:27:00,hhn07o,"Yep! And Shane’s net worth is currently $12 million, which obviously would include all his and probably Ryland’s assets. He bought a new house and new cars, I hope he saved his money! And who knows what contract he is tied into with Jaffar"
4689,2020-06-28 22:42:31,hhn07o,"As soon as Shane and Jeffree started to form a friendship, I immediately knew that J* would grow bored of him and throw him away like he's done with all of his other ""friends."" I just didn't expect it to be this much of a shitshow, damn."
4690,2020-06-29 02:53:42,hhn07o,"Shane making the series on Tara (con), J*, and Jake Paul were all efforts to redeem someone with a problematic image and it worked.

The Tana thing worked on a lot of people in my timeline, I saw. My ex HATED Jeffree Star and after the Shane series, she actually liked him and started watching his videos. A streamer I watch was one of the biggest critics of the Paul brothers but came out of Shane's series on Jake Paul like ""I maybe judged him too harshly"".

 PR comebacks *were* the  whole point. And it'll be hilarious and karmic if one of those people he ""redeemed"" is the one who instigated Shane's own downfall."
4691,2020-06-29 01:05:17,hhn07o,"We all know j\* likes to control the narrative and steer the drama/tea channels in the right direction (Ashlye Kyle for one).  I mean, if he really wanted to tank everyone he could go nuclear with all the ""proof"" he has, but then he's also going down because I'm sure people have as much proof on him.  It's interesting how Dramageddon 1 was pretty much caused by him, Dramageddon 2 it turns out was orchestrated by him, and now this ""Dramageddon 3"" \*must\* involve him somehow."
4692,2020-06-29 05:49:25,hhn07o,Shane didn't know Jeffree back then. It's all on Shane.
4693,2020-06-29 05:24:53,hhn07o,"While I agree that jafar is obviously problematic, so is Shane. On top of his very problematic behaviour he was still hanging out with trish who is also problematic. 
Becoming friends with jeffree is just the cream of the problematic crop , the cherry on the already problematic cake 
But I can’t deny that if Shane never engaged with jeffree in the first place, his own problematic past would probably not have come out like this / yet Or I think it would have been easier for him to find some excuse to explain it away"
4694,2020-06-29 07:40:38,hhn07o,I have said this so much. Anyone who associates with Jeffree is signing up for the beginning of the end
4695,2020-06-29 07:14:53,hhn07o,I'd do that for half a million
4696,2020-06-29 21:00:51,hhn07o,"Shane has never changed, Jeffree was of no influence on him other than bringing him into the beauty guru world to make more money. Proof that Shane was like this before Jeffree: https://youtu.be/GcZ0PXabwt0"
4697,2020-06-29 06:38:39,hhn07o,I hear that old pump 8 from down town by bennagins
4698,2020-06-29 11:45:09,hhn07o,Why are you blaming Jeffree Star for what SHANE did before he even met him???
4699,2020-06-29 15:18:13,hhn07o,He sold his soul to the devil and is now paying the price
4700,2020-06-29 16:24:40,hhn07o,"Chile, Shane was already publicly talking about his torture / murder fantasies re. women, and saying he'd rape if he could get away with it, loooong before he met Jeffree."
4701,2020-07-10 00:28:25,hhn07o,"While I do think Jeffree Star is a master manipulator and drama queen, I think Shane’s actions are his own, especially his old videos, podcasts etc."
4702,2020-06-28 23:02:17,hhn07o,Yes this! I swear these other YT just collaborate with Shane as a business deal. It’s not for any other reason but to bring views to both of them. He hit the jack pot with j* ... well so Shane thought.
4703,2020-06-29 11:45:44,hhn07o,"> Jeffree dragged Shane into his problematic world. 

uh I mean I dunno if you watched the same shit I did but Shane dove head first in he sure as shit was not dragged."
4704,2020-06-29 05:33:19,hhn07o,"Yes omg. Stop blaming Jeffree for Shane’s past behaviour. All these things people are taking issue with...took place before Jeffree. Jeffree comes with his own baggage, yes. Shane hasn’t spoken out against Jeffree, yes. But that’s not really the issue that’s not his fight tbh Jeffree should be the one making some sort of public comment not Shane"
4705,2020-06-29 21:52:01,hhn07o,"I didn’t say he was the one who made him problematic. It’s not even really implied, I’m saying it from a.. allegorical or metaphorical perspective of a sinner making a deal with the devil that’s all. Shane is already the sinner."
4706,2020-06-28 23:28:10,hhn07o,"Agreed. I thought of this theory too especially when I considered that Jeffree kept saying over and over in anything related to dramaggedon 2 ""Shane and I"". Even when shane was never even mentioned at all.

It's like he was sowing a seed that sprouted into a shane dawson dumpster fire as soon as shane watered it with his Twitter statement.

Also I was wondering where is the source of these shane clips? Who is the original person that is sharing it? Because it just pops out of nowhere."
4707,2020-06-29 01:33:26,hhn07o,Does BW = Blaire White? How was her video clearly pro Jeffree? It wasn't positive for Jeffree or Shane
4708,2020-06-29 09:41:36,hhn07o,"Nah, i know u guys hate Jeffre but dont use him as scapegoat for shane.

Shane  is getting exposed for the things he did years before he met jeffre."
4709,2020-06-29 09:42:39,hhn07o,"yup, shane stans using jeffre as scapegoat is hilarious. 

he legit is getting exposed for al the things he said and did way before jeffre's friendship"
4710,2020-06-29 11:48:00,hhn07o,"I’m not, not at all."
4711,2020-07-04 01:39:13,hhn07o,It definitely felt like Jeffree was minding his own businesses and in walks this puppy begging for a lap and a sit at the table.
4712,2020-06-29 05:42:05,hhn07o,"Also can't believe OP is saying Jeffree is ""making this footage come out""... All this shit was ON YOUTUBE UNTIL VERY RECENTLY. Shane only took it down once he saw Jenna do similar."
4713,2020-06-28 23:34:25,hhn07o,They are popping up out of nowhere! I don’t think it’s all from unaffiliated fans.
4714,2020-06-29 05:17:28,hhn07o,"yep.  jeffree would always bring up shane for seemingly no reason at all.  he knew what he was doing.  he knew that if it all went down in flames it would take some of the heat off him, and with shane already being problematic as well, it would open the flood gates and be easier for him to manipulate the situation.

obviously shane isn’t even close to innocent, but i just find it so weird that shane is being absolutely DEMOLISHED rn and almost no one is talking about jeffree."
4715,2020-06-29 02:05:47,hhn07o,"On the surface, no, but when you step back and take a look you’ll see that it reeks of Jeffree and I believe he manipulated or paid her to make thus video. She didn’t reveal anything new that would take him or Shane down. Everyone already says he’s a bad person. The only new piece of information she provided is that she has heard the infamous voice memo and believes it’s credible.

This plays right in Jeffree’s hand. Now everyone is questioning if JC is as innocent as we thought, and we are back to rehashing Drammageddon II."
4716,2020-06-29 10:08:19,hhn07o,Remember in mean girls when regina put her own name in the burn book to achieve the final manipulation. I got those vibes from this. J* will spread the word he's a monster if that's what it takes to make everyone else fight eachother. As long as he's manipulatung he's winning.
4717,2020-06-29 12:16:59,hhn07o,Jeffree definitely isn’t a scapegoat goat for Shane. I just never expected Jeffree to be part of what dragged Shane’s disgusting behavior into the mainstream media.
4718,2020-06-29 21:50:18,hhn07o,I’m not saying Shane is innocent and blaming Jeffree for Shane’s actions. I am saying that Jeffree is probably the one releasing old footage of Shane and showing people where to find it however and stand by that 100%
4719,2020-06-29 02:23:55,hhn07o,"I doubt it. I fairly Conservative, you can read my post history so I may be off as I don't know the history of the drama of random gay men but watch Blaire every now and then

She seems genuine enough to not blatantly lie or sell out. I think the video really was like she said to make it so she isn't complicit in JS's ""schemes"" by keeping his ""secret"""
4720,2020-06-29 21:56:11,hhn07o,Showing people where to find it .. it's just been on his YouTube. He's never taken it down until now.
4721,2020-06-29 02:45:40,hhn07o,"I don't think she ever intended to try and prop up Jeffree, but I imagine it will be very easy for him and his following to run with her video and only mention the part about the James Charles recording, and completely ignore how Jeffree uses sexual assault allegations as blackmail instead of treating them seriously"
4722,2020-06-29 02:48:02,hhn07o,"Yeah, I could maybe see that but I do not think it was Blaire's intention to help Jeffree(I definitely do not think she was paid to help him) or to hurt James(although since she believes the accusation she likely doesn't care)

The whole point of the video was to get out what she knows into the open so she no longer felt complicit by keeping it a secret. She is aware she may have been manipulated by JS, she says this but she's damned if she doesnt, damned if she does."
4723,2020-06-28 20:46:45,hhljww,Megathread
4724,2020-06-28 20:25:29,hhljww,Tldw?
4725,2020-06-28 20:36:10,hhljww,Can the police get involved at this point if Jeffree is truly withholding evidence of p*d0 acts or whatever the claim is? And can they charge him for blackmail?
4726,2020-06-28 20:43:57,hhljww,This makes me think he told tati about this as well and that is why she felt validated doing the video without explicitly putting the victim in the hot seat. Jeffree has obviously been writing the narrative for awhile and getting someone else to do his dirty work of exposing the voice memo.
4727,2020-06-28 20:49:50,hhljww,"This video just proves that Jeffree is leaking information to people to manufacture drama. He thought that once Tati made per video all of these other people that he leaked info to would come forward with more 'proof' to validate Tati. 

He really thinks he's the Regina George of fucking Game of Thrones or something. Does he remember what happened to Petyr Baelish?"
4728,2020-06-28 20:43:38,hhljww,"My biggest problem with her video was when she kept asking “what would you do if you knew these things? What would *you* dooo??”  


Well I’d call the bloody police or something Blaire, not make a YouTube video about it. 

But yeah she got seriously played"
4729,2020-06-28 20:39:06,hhljww,I wish Blaire would’ve discussed this voice memo with James Charles and also confirm from the alleged victim that if the voice memo was real.
4730,2020-06-28 20:45:53,hhljww,"The 'He' in the title is Jeffree, not misgendering Blaire for anyone who doesn't get it."
4731,2020-06-28 20:24:40,hhljww,"Wait, what did she say?
I generally dialike her too because of her anti feminist views and the fact that she is gate keeping ""transness"" to conventionally attractive people."
4732,2020-06-28 20:31:39,hhljww,"She basically said that jeffree star sent her a voice mail of the ALLEGED victim of James Charles. She was disgusted about the fact that j* is using a persons story to black mail and manipulate people. I do not think a simple voice memo is enough evidence to accuse someone of that. I also think shes doing exactly what j* wanted, he wants everyone to be back on James Charles. He sending people all this “evidence” so someone would make a video about it, annnnd Blaire did exactly that. Im not saying she should’ve kept her mouth shut, but I am saying she should’ve talked to James Charles about this. The chances of J* just paying someone to make that voice memo is extremely high. He wants the attention off his back. Plus since he has some weird hatred for James Charles, dont you find it weird how he keeps asking all these people their opinions on James Charles."
4733,2020-06-28 20:41:38,hhljww,"Im not sure, because with the James Charles stuff all of it is alleged there is no valid proof. All J* has is a voice mail, but in Blaires video she does say that he has alot of serous dirt on other people. Like she said he has “evidence” about a youtuber who r*ped someone. I find it completely disgusting how he’s just holding someone trauma as black mail, but yea sadly I dont know about that."
4734,2020-06-28 21:19:38,hhljww,"Damn, didn’t think of it like that. Your probably right. Tati ain’t innocent but jeffree definitely told her something🤔"
4735,2020-06-28 20:54:43,hhljww,"She actually did say she talked to the victim to encourage them to share their story, but again the chances of J* just paying someone to make this up is very high. Blaire is a r*pe surviver and she sympathizes with them, but she should know how dirty jeffree star is. All because its a “credible” source dosent mean it entirely true."
4736,2020-06-28 22:18:08,hhljww,She said absolutely nothing of value and added nothing new that we didn't already know. What a surprise huh
4737,2020-06-28 20:33:05,hhljww,"I definitely find it weird, he has a weird obsession with him.

Thanks for the summary"
4738,2020-06-29 11:33:57,hhljww,From my understanding Blaire messaged the alleged victim but their was no response back.
4739,2020-06-28 19:48:28,hhkp6z,"I also have the pallet and feel really bad for buying it and giving my money to him. But what can I do about it now, still gonna use it doesn't matter anymore (never buying from him again tho)"
4740,2020-06-28 19:56:48,hhkp6z,"Same. I loved Shane like LOVED Shane. And when he would get into controversy’s over the past couple of years, I kind of looked over them because I wasn’t that into twitter so I had no idea he’s done all of this. But I’m active on twitter now and I don’t feel comfortable supporting him anymore. I have his merch from when it was on amazon but I never got the makeup"
4741,2020-06-28 21:13:30,hhkp6z,I’m in the same boat. I’ve been following him since I was in 5th grade. Same for j*. I’m mad at myself and I’m mad at them. It’s left nothing but a horrible taste in my mouth.
4742,2020-06-29 02:47:26,hhkp6z,"I’ll say this my friend, maya angelou is one of my favorite authors. She once said, “do the best you can until you know better. When you know better, do better”. Peter monn also put it in a video recently about Shane. 

I think you didn’t know at the time. We could argue that we should all be more informed consumers, that’s completely valid. However, now that you do know is what’s important. You’re withdrawing your support and I respect you for it.

We grow everyday, don’t beat yourself up too bad. We all are learning from this and will make better decisions on who to support."
4743,2020-06-29 03:55:09,hhkp6z,Yeah I bought one of his books (I think the one with the Lottery) and really enjoyed it at the time. I guess the best we can do now is not give any more money to him..
4744,2020-06-29 04:41:36,hhkp6z,Stop. Everyone gets played in one way or another and sociopaths are charming and manipulative. Blaming yourself accomplishes nothing. He and J* are at fault not you.
4745,2020-06-29 04:48:52,hhkp6z,"Guys omg you can't beat yourselves up over this! Just remember, parents hired john wayne gacy to preform at their kids birthday parties!! Now dont you feel better?? 😍"
4746,2020-06-28 19:49:22,hhkp6z,"Exactly. Hate to say it but they’re well made products. And we spent our hard earned money (which I’m assuming we have much less of than them..) on it. 

I’m debating sanding mine down and painting a dopey picture on it honestly."
4747,2020-06-28 19:59:33,hhkp6z,I never had Twitter so I really missed a majority of this. Which is fine. I only saw it second hand on Reddit or YouTube but it’s WILD. When he mentioned blackface I kind of denied it to myself but if you google “Shane Dawson blackface” it’s BAD. Like not just Shanaynay.
4748,2020-06-29 02:48:01,hhkp6z,Very well said. Thank you <3
4749,2020-06-29 02:48:08,hhkp6z,Also user name on point.
4750,2020-06-29 12:02:03,hhkp6z,Could you imagine tho...
4751,2020-06-29 11:38:01,hhkp6z,😂😂😂😂
4752,2020-06-28 19:54:20,hhkp6z,"Agree. I feel kinda sad that he's getting cancelled, because I used to really like and support him, but he could've used some brain and stfu. He made millions from these pallets but still pretends to be poor (like come on) some fans litterally gave him their last cents"
4753,2020-06-29 05:34:09,hhkp6z,You could bedazzle it up too! Get some rhinestones and glue and cover up the top so you can't even see what was there. Paint the sides/bottom. Or even just depan the shadows into a magnetic palette. I'm sure they aren't too bad get out of the cardboard. Someone probably has already made a video on it.
4754,2020-06-28 20:01:04,hhkp6z,Yes! It’s so much blackface which is actually crazy. More and more evidence keeps resurfacing and I thought I seen it all but there’s just so much more.
4755,2020-06-29 02:48:35,hhkp6z,🍓❤️🍓
4756,2020-06-28 19:57:55,hhkp6z,That bothers me so much the “I’m poor” bit was so upsetting. He’d always say “I grew up broke!” Boy I grew up broke and I’m STILL BROKE.  It didn’t feel good to see him sipping Diet Coke in a Versace robe while on break at my crappy job.
4757,2020-06-28 20:02:22,hhkp6z,"Oh yeah the Milly the puppet thing just came up and I honestly forgot ALL ABOUT those videos. But even my 12 year old self thought those were super weird, but “it’s fine because it’s Shane!”  

We’ve been had."
4758,2020-06-29 04:51:57,hhkp6z,"Chuckle. Yes. He was already blessed and rich in so many ways, to succeed on yt, to find a decent guy, to have friends but it's like two kids playing with toys, fighting. They want the NEW toy and if they don't get it it's tantrum time. Dawson got greedy. Look what it earned him."
4759,2020-06-28 19:59:54,hhkp6z,Well said...
4760,2020-06-28 20:03:44,hhkp6z,Wait.. what now?
4761,2020-06-28 20:04:33,hhkp6z,He made a video with the fine brothers and they had a puppet (like a literal puppet) named Milly and her whole bit was that she was a child being sexually abused by her family. They made all kinds of jokes about it.
4762,2020-06-28 21:34:54,hhkp6z,Wtf
4763,2020-06-28 21:35:18,hhkp6z,Yeah it’s no good.
4764,2020-06-28 18:28:35,hhjdx6,What happened to the mega thread?
4765,2020-06-28 18:30:20,hhjdx6,Please please please can no one speculate on who the alleged victim might be
4766,2020-06-28 18:25:42,hhjdx6,[deleted]
4767,2020-06-28 18:23:52,hhjdx6,I can feel this bomb dropping from another continent
4768,2020-06-28 18:27:04,hhjdx6,SO the only friend of Shane's to actually disavow his fucked up behaviour publicly is Blaire fucking White!!!??? I'm losing my goddamn mind
4769,2020-06-28 18:27:23,hhjdx6,"Definitely recommend looking at D'Angelo Wallace's tweets. he said something along the lines of Blair's video just helps JS.

A comment on the video says ""this was Jeffrees plan all along. For this info to be released without it coming from him""

Eta: im not blaming Blaire for the video. I would do the same thing. What I'm saying is I think JS told everyone he could so that someone would make a video on it and take the heat off him."
4770,2020-06-28 18:53:13,hhjdx6,"I think the problem with Blair bringing up that alleged voice memo, is that she calls it credible. How did she come to the conclusion that this was not fabricated? Why is she taking it at face value? She mentioned she reached out to the alleged victim, but she never specified if she got a response or a confirmation from them. I'm sorry, but I can't just take her word for it and I'm sure as hell not taking Jusseff Estrella's word either. These are very serious accusations and what we're not gonna do this year is jump on bandwagons."
4771,2020-06-28 18:29:37,hhjdx6,"I can't find a thread linking to her video in the sub, so in case someone wants it: https://youtu.be/P9wlKco2YYI"
4772,2020-06-28 18:41:20,hhjdx6,"I'm just going to add this here. Until that recording is leaked, verified to be true by other YouTubers, or the person in that memo comes forward themselves, nothing further can be done about it, and JC remains innocent until proven guilty.

The issue Blair White is bringing up is that Jeffree Star is recording and obtaining recording of victims of sexual abuse telling their stories to people they trust and spreading it around as if it's hot gossip, as well blackmailing other people with them.

This kind of behaviour threatens the safety and privacy of the victims of these assaults, and forces them to relive that hell each and every time Jeffree Star spreads their stories around for a gossip and a giggle. These people deserve better than to have their trust violated in such ways.

These aren't old stories either, Blair White's interactions with Jeffree Star has been in the last month, so don't even bother trying to excuse this behaviour as a past mistake. It's a very present and very disgusting one, and he needs to be held accountable for it."
4773,2020-06-28 18:25:54,hhjdx6,"I am so glad she spoke on this, so glad."
4774,2020-06-28 18:28:52,hhjdx6,Why is there not a post about Blaire's original video? Are JC fans that jaded they refuse to hear the truth?
4775,2020-06-28 18:42:34,hhjdx6,"Agreed, they have every right to have their privacy respected, and don't deserve to be harassed over the actions and behaviours of others for others to gossip over. They are victims, and deserve better."
4776,2020-06-28 18:32:59,hhjdx6,"Can you IMAGINE!!! I'm honestly shocked. While I am in no way a fan of Blaire, I'm glad she has spoken up and said how wrong Shane's behavior was. She has always been outspoken against anything involving children, so kudos to her for doing that"
4777,2020-06-28 18:31:32,hhjdx6,"Curious as to why j*'s motives even matter given the truth Blaire revealed about James. It's not Jeffrees or Blaires story to tell, it's the victims which we know now does exist"
4778,2020-06-28 18:33:44,hhjdx6,"I disagree. She spoke about it because she felt it was her duty to do so- And she outed Jeffree's vile behaviour in weaponizing evidence for his own gain- both as blackmail and as a tool to get people on his side. I know it's not exactly new info to us, but for people who may not be following this stuff closely... It's hugely damning against him."
4779,2020-06-28 18:30:02,hhjdx6,"It doesn’t cast a good light on J*, he is using evidence of sexual molestation to keep people in line. 

However, if she heard the memo of the victim talking about the assault from JC, she shouldn’t have to keep that to herself in order to keep the heat on J*."
4780,2020-06-28 19:00:38,hhjdx6,"My guess would be that, since she knows who this person is, it matches up to something James Charles himself addressed last year. Or at the very least, that it means Jeffree Star isn't lying about the recording as a lot of people have suspected for the past year.

She's named a few other YouTube's who have apparently had this recording shared with them aswell. So hopefully they'll be willing to come forward to help either address things or clear things up."
4781,2020-06-28 18:32:29,hhjdx6,[deleted]
4782,2020-06-28 18:37:51,hhjdx6,I agree with her reasoning WHY she felt compelled to make a video I think JS kept telling everyone so someone WOULD make it into a video. That's all I'm saying.
4783,2020-06-28 18:42:30,hhjdx6,"I'm not saying she should keep that to herself. I'm saying that was JS plan all along. To have someone make this video that wasn't him.. no shade thrown at Blaire. I would do the same thing but it seems he's trying to throw all the attention to James instead of taking accountability for his own shit behaviour.

I'll also make it clear I'm not defending james, but it's innocent until proven guilty in the US and so far no victim has actually come forward. We just need to be cautious with how we all proceed. This just stepped up a level."
4784,2020-06-28 18:36:54,hhjdx6,"Oh I'm right there with you, I never liked James because his come up was based off a lie. I always believed Tati, not because I want to dislike James more I could give two shits how his career is going lol. Her and J* are far too old and smart to make allegations with zero proof. People love to forget, James called Tati mom ffs she did think she was doing the right thing by intervening."
4785,2020-06-28 17:35:59,hhhxma,"So this made my stomach churn. If Jeffree is lying, then he could be sued for defamation. But if he's telling the truth, then he willingly shared private information because he thought it was ""tea"". Either way he's terrible."
4786,2020-06-28 17:24:52,hhhxma,Didn’t Jeffree say in a text message to James that one of the Dolan twins were going to go on camera and talk about how James molested them? Was that actually true? The sister squad aren’t friends anymore even after James put his side out. I honestly don’t know what to think anymore this entire thing is a mess
4787,2020-06-28 17:32:43,hhhxma,"I keep saying this, but I truly mean it: I think Shane is done after this. If someone like Blaire White isn't defending him now, with no one on his side? Yeah, no, he's done. As far as Jeffree goes? Eh, I think it's going to end up how it always is, he skirts by with barely a scratch, while Shane takes the blunt of the heat. Of course, most of the issues people are having right now are for Shane, but that doesn't mean that there isn't a problem with this entire little clique. 

I don't normally watch Blaire White, but this was engaging and eye-opening. Will be interesting to see what happens in the coming days."
4788,2020-06-28 19:36:26,hhhxma,"Everyone saying “why haven’t any of these people who’ve heard the voice memos gone to the police”’don’t really seem to understand how reporting sexual assault works and have way too much faith in the justice system. On top of the fact that it’s up to the victim to come forward if they wanted to, reporting sexual assault very very rarely leads to actual consequences for the perpetrator and often only further traumatizes a victim. These things are VERY hard to prove even when everyone’s acting in the victim’s best interest (which itself is rare to begin with). I don’t blame the victim for not wanting to come forward/go to the police at all, and it isn’t anyone else’s place to do so, speaking as a SA survivor myself."
4789,2020-06-28 17:21:36,hhhxma,"I don't normally like Blaire but I think she's speaking from the heart. I can't say if it was right to post this because it'll probably just cause more speculation about who the rapist is with potentially innocent names getting thrown around. However I understand why she felt like she couldn't just sit on this information because she's right, he's making her complicit by gossiping with her about serious allegations and it is really fucked up on his part. I think she's trying to do the right thing and he's put her in a horrible position."
4790,2020-06-28 18:02:27,hhhxma,"Tdlr of blaire’s video:

She starts of by saying that she was scared to release the video, but decided to go ahead as it was “the right thing to do” Claims to have been told things by J that made her feel complicit to his actions

Verifies that she has never met J, but facetimed him twice

She explains that when she was making a video on Dahvie Vanity, J called her and manipulated her into not releasing the vid. She agreed to not release it.

When she saw J on the Chris Hansen podcast “clearing” his name, she realized he lied and dropped the video

On the facetime when J was manipulative, she claims that J told her that James Charles raped a well known youtuber and he provided a voice memo proving it. Blaire feels that it is not her place to release the memo, but urges the victim to speak up.

She claims J told her that another well known youtuber raped someone, but while J provided no evidence, she believes it is “believable”

She finishes by saying she doesn’t condone shanes jokes, amd that she just discovered everything like the rest of us.

To conclude, she provided no receipts, but i think not releasing the voice memo is understandable if its true

She says that keemstar probs has heard the voice memo as J is alleged to have played it to him before an interview

Edit: words"
4791,2020-06-28 17:28:00,hhhxma,"Holy crap I thought she was going to defend Shane. That was very very good of her!

I struggle to even comment on J*"

4794,2020-06-28 22:14:28,hhhxma,"So she heard a voice memo that may or may not be a popular youtuber. She said she reached out to that person but didn't say if they confirmed or responded or anything. Only that she reached out to them.

Devils advocate: That person might be embarrassed about Jeffree sharing personal info OR just doesn't know wtf she's talking about

Seems like Jeffree really wants to get this story out and Blaire finally did that for him with no actual proof. Except for a voice memo that may or may not be a popular youtuber.

OK."
4795,2020-06-28 21:25:05,hhhxma,"This was so planned by Jafar. Very strategic move on his part to get the focus off Shane, and sort of off himself as well. He’s very smart and manipulative which is really scary. He used Blaire as a pawn to do his dirty work. Ugh. So when can we start digging up Jeffrees past videos? I know there’s a lot. He is a hateful man."
4796,2020-06-28 17:46:44,hhhxma,"I've always wondered why James didn't sue Tati and Jeffree, but if there's credibility to this voice note, that explains why."
4797,2020-06-28 18:08:31,hhhxma,"I won't blindly believe what blaire said after tati's allegations last year were proven to be false. The fact that jeffree has ""dirt"" against people that he uses to his advantage, and that he's outing an alleged sexual assault victim is more concerning. I'm not defending James, but I won't believe anything without proof. 

PS: I read on BGC that this Blaire woman is a racist and transphobe?"
4798,2020-06-28 17:37:07,hhhxma,Can someone give a rundown of the video?
4799,2020-06-28 19:02:46,hhhxma,Her Instagram story right now is kinda heart breaking. This is the most genuine I've ever seen Blaire be.
4800,2020-06-28 20:22:58,hhhxma,"I understand, but it’s also not her place to leak something like that. But at the same time, there’s nothing to convince me to believe. her."
4801,2020-06-28 17:28:46,hhhxma,"Wow... that was a lot. So there’s credibility to Jefrees statement about James being a predator? Holy shit. Twitter and the YouTube community is already up in flames fire Blaire just threw a fucking nuclear bomb into it lmao. 
This is a lot to unpack. I appreciate Blaire holding Shane accountable in the end. All this is making my heart hurt."
4802,2020-06-28 18:06:13,hhhxma,I am just guessing but if what Blaire said is true and if Jeffree really has a voice memo proving that JC did infact molest someone then I think its Grayson Dolan. He is the only one I could think of since Jeffree kept bringing Grayson’s name while all of this was going on last year. He said several times that “Grayson was molested by James” but James said in his “No more lies” video that its not true coz Grayson reached out to him and asked if hes okay. But I don’t know!! Ahhhhhh I am so confused and starting to think everything is a lie!!! 😤😤😤The only thing I am sure of is that Jeffree is a piece of shit.
4803,2020-06-28 22:41:06,hhhxma," I don't believe Blaire and Jeffree have anything on James. James is the only one to this day to actually provide receipts and pretty much debunk everything.

What Blaire and Jeffree have done is absolutely fucking disgusting. All they have to do is claim they have something and people believe it."
4804,2020-06-28 22:49:17,hhhxma,"JF Was able to get David in everybody’s mind, now the same thing but instead of ham and Shane. I can’t help but think Jeffrey’s behind it putting out the negative heat on Shane To keep people distracted off Jeffrey"
4805,2020-06-29 00:31:30,hhhxma," 

She barely mentions shane just in the last 2 min. She did say its disgusting. but I think that blaire as a person whose content is mainly exposing predators (she acknowledges that people are calling her out in dms) then going on to say in her comments that she is going into more detail on her insta story and not on her main channel is really strange. Since she uses her large platform mostly for calling out ""predators"""
4806,2020-06-29 02:43:21,hhhxma,I am happy Blaire did not play the voice memo. Imagine if it was fabricated; James would be on fire again for something that isn't real.
4807,2020-06-29 05:39:28,hhhxma,Can we talk about the absolute irony of Blair White refusing to be a  pawn for Jeffree while simultaneously making a video that makes his actions look more justified and also taking the heat off of him and acting as a distraction while he's currently being canceled for racist shit in his past? Blair is either being paid for this or is legitimately that stupid.
4808,2020-06-30 09:57:25,hhhxma,What if the victim was paid to make the voice memo? What if Jeffree has dirt on the YouTube and blackmailed him into making the voice memo? These are options too I think...
4809,2020-06-28 20:36:10,hhhxma,"The only authentic thing about this video is that it’s authentic Blaire White grifting. She’s taking advantage of a big name YouTuber going down in flames for views and attention. 

Just like how she has commodified her “outrage” at Jessica Yaniv, an alleged child sex offender, she’s putting serious allegations about someone she knows online for money, but with enough vagueness that she doesn’t get drawn in. If she was genuinely that upset or affected by the situation, she would speak with the victim in private and respect their wishes for how they’d like to proceed with it. This is a serious criminal matter, not a fun piece of YouTube drama. 

Just as I thought, trash."
4810,2020-06-28 19:36:59,hhhxma,"I kind of don’t even see the point in Blair’s calling out Jeffree for not showing the proof that he said he had. 

Like she said that he had shown her proof that one person had been “raped” by James Charles, meaning that she should show it. She should have recorded the conversation or whatever. 

So actually isn’t she doing the same as he was? If you have proof that somebody is a “predator” you should show the proof. 

I like Blaire and I have a lot of time for her videos, mainly because my own brother is a mtf transgender, so I can relate to a lot of her videos. This one though.... kind of feels a bit hypocritical."
4811,2020-06-28 19:06:20,hhhxma,I 100% think the voice memo was fabricated - its so convenient to now spin everything back to james just as it got a little too hot for jefferson
4812,2020-06-28 17:40:45,hhhxma,[deleted]
4813,2020-06-28 17:30:15,hhhxma,I can’t keep up with it all. This is far beyond drama. This is fucking insane. What are we meant to do with all this information? I appreciate Blaire holding Shane accountable at the end. My head is beginning to hurt.
4814,2020-06-29 00:38:34,hhhxma,"> Didn’t Jeffree say in a text message to James that one of the Dolan twins were going to go on camera and talk about how James molested them?

James actually pulled up that text in his response video. He explained it away, but the Dolan twins never confirmed or denied it. But the twins did film a collab with Jeffree after dramageddon, so take that how you will."
4815,2020-06-28 18:29:45,hhhxma,"She posted on Instagram live and said she is probably going to make a video about Shane talking about things in more depth since she feels lime she would be a hypocrite if she didn’t call him out just like she’s done with Onision and other people displaying pedophiliac behavior. It’ll be interesting to see, especially considering how much she cares about him. But I’m really glad she saw through his facade and realized that she couldn’t make any excuses for him."
4816,2020-06-28 23:11:04,hhhxma,"Yk... this is making me think. Here's a theory: J* knew that dramaggedon 2 was going to resurface or atleast some backlash on his end would stem from it. So he prepared for it. He kept including shane whenever addressing himself and the tati/james charles incident. Whenever he addressed it and spoke on his involvement he always said *""shane and I""* not just ""I"". it's easy to lose your attention so by involving shane everytime he spoke on it, he started to plant that seed that shane was involved. That essentially lead to everyone watching shane very carefully and then lead to the resurfacing of Shane's past.

J* can now sit back and hide behind this chaos and atleast buy some more time before anymore hate or criticism goes straight to him bringing him back into the spotlight. Shane made a huge mistake when he posted that Twitter statement because he started his own witch hunt. I'm sure eventually things would resurface again anyways as more attention was on shane now due to the association with dramaggedon 2  but not at this rate. It was still more like speculation but now its something that people more strongly believe."
4817,2020-06-28 20:17:32,hhhxma,"Shane made millions from all of the make up and merchandise, he'll be okay."
4818,2020-06-30 03:44:32,hhhxma,Thank you for saying this. 💗
4819,2020-06-28 19:01:27,hhhxma,">she claims that J told her that James Charles raped a well known youtuber and he provided a voice memo proving it

I think she spoke about another youtuber being a rapist, not James. James is accused of molestation, not rape. Both horrible though. Won't make the mistake I did last year. Without proof, I won't cancel James, and her saying that isn't proof enough"
4820,2020-06-28 19:59:54,hhhxma,I love him.
4821,2020-06-28 19:56:56,hhhxma,I’m so worried for Shane’s mental health regardless of my feelings towards him. He’s always been so fragile and sensitive.
4822,2020-06-28 22:19:50,hhhxma,Not really people are seeing right through it
4823,2020-06-29 00:26:33,hhhxma,"I think it's telling that only outsiders like blaire and ashley kyle are getting manipulated by j* to bring up his memo.      
        
While people like shane who are close to the situation aren't using it in their own defence. It was absent from shane's raw unfiltered twitter rant, who didn't seem to think james deserved anything more than what he got last year."
4824,2020-06-28 23:04:08,hhhxma,He showed her the voice message a month ago though
4825,2020-06-28 18:13:50,hhhxma,"Here’s the thing. Everyone is assuming after Blair’s video that it’s likely a Dolan twin since she said it was a YouTuber and because of the text Jeff sent JC about “getting on camera with G Dolan so he can tell the world how you sexually molested him”.

But in that receipt video James obviously posted that text and said he KNEW Jeff was lying because the twins had texted him to make sure he was okay. If James did assault GD what he did in that video was a huge risk. He’s basically be daring JS and GD to come out with the proof."
4826,2020-06-28 17:58:41,hhhxma,It all adds up now.
4827,2020-06-28 18:49:17,hhhxma,"Blaire has been very problematic in the past, but she seems to really have changed lately. In regards to her being transphobic, Blaire is someone who holds to traditional views in regard to biological sex, i.e. she believes she was born male and transitioned to female, not that she is intrinsically female and was assigned the wrong gender based on her body. She has definitely said other stuff in the past though."
4828,2020-06-28 18:21:49,hhhxma,"She's not a transphobe or racist. But she is a conservative trans woman who isn't afraid of calling out people, even those part of the LGBT community, so... She gets a lot of heat for that."
4829,2020-06-28 18:44:01,hhhxma,"She's a trans woman who believes transgenderism is caused by gender dysphoria, the feeling of dissonance between your physical body and self perception, which can be treated by transitioning. Some people who say they're trans thinks this invalidates them, so she's transphobic because of that. She also believes there are two genders, and doesn't think nonbinary is the same thing as being transgender. 

I really haven't seen much on her channel that makes me think she's racist. She did vote for Trump but has also been critical of things he does that she disagrees with. She seems to like strong immigration policy, but at the same time, she's half latina, so it's kinda hard to sit here and say she hates Mexicans; especially considering her best friend is one. She's done videos about a variety of very left social politics people, some of which were black, and she tends to take digs or make jokes about the people she's responding to.

Off the top of my head I can only remember her calling Peaches a beast. People thought it was racist, Blaire said it was because of Peaches pretending to prostitute her infant daughter and endorse pedophilia."
4830,2020-06-28 18:22:22,hhhxma,Blaire is a transgender woman herself. Not that you can't be a transgender transphobe but I thought I'd mention it.
4831,2020-06-28 18:54:13,hhhxma,not sure about the racism but she uses a lot of trans-medical rhetoric that sort of excludes non binary people from who she considers to be “trans”. vaush sucks but he did a debate with her that made things pretty clear
4832,2020-06-28 17:45:59,hhhxma,"There was a lot of stuff, but in a nutshell there may be some truth (Allegedly) to Jeffree’s accusation about James Charles being a predator. There is a voice memo of the victim accusing JC. Blaire actually spoke to the victim adding some credibility to Jeffree. Also Jeffree sees it as drama and tea and not as an actual crime. She also says she was told by Jeffree about a famous YouTuber that is a rapist."
4833,2020-06-29 04:25:24,hhhxma,"Jeffree has unverified proof that James and another youtuber did terrible things (sexual assault, rape) and he showed this to Blaire the first call they had. He's using his ""proof"" as a leverage against people."
4834,2020-06-29 10:39:27,hhhxma,"It is her place to talk about what Jeffree is doing with potential proof of a crime, she never leaked anything"
4835,2020-06-28 18:21:39,hhhxma,Ugh I feel so confused too!! I feel like it’s also interesting to note that the twins filmed videos with Jeffree after all of the drama last year... I’m not sure what to take from that. Were they on Jeffree’s side and was there some truth to what Jeffree was claiming?? Grayson and Ethan are still following Jeffree on insta.. hmm
4836,2020-06-28 20:56:35,hhhxma,"Last year I found it odd how James said Dolan twins were the first to contact him yet still they ended up hanging out with Jeffree and not James. I thought that maybe James did go a little too far with throwing himself on Grayson, but definitely didn't think he raped him or anything close. I thought maybe Grayson was torn about what to do, whether to come out with a statement or not and ended up deciding not to. I have a feeling what Jeffree said is true or at least close to truth :/

Either way Jeffree is literally Satan even if he's being trithful lol"
4837,2020-06-29 01:37:30,hhhxma,"She didn't definitively say, just that she heard a clip. She doesn't have the actual 'evidence'"
4838,2020-06-30 03:09:16,hhhxma,"This ""receipt"" they may or may not have is a lot more complicated than a petty text message. If released without the authorization of the original sender, that's a complete violation of privacy and may even have legal implications."
4839,2020-06-28 21:06:47,hhhxma,"She doesn’t think of it as a “fun piece of YouTube drama”. She explained in the video that this information is not “tea” and she doesn’t want to treat it as such.

Just as I thought, typical Blaire White hater rhetoric calling her a “grifter” when she’s one of the most genuine content creators out there."
4840,2020-06-28 20:53:59,hhhxma,"i just wanna know, what about this feels like a drama video? She was friends with Shane, and got a lot of help from him a while ago. Realizing your friend is a part of something awful, and having what you believe are facts that may help him isnt just drama. 

Obviously she doesnt want to defend Shane, with the end of the video. But she associated with him, and seemed to actually care about him before she found out hes creepy as hell. The video isnt monetized, and it doesnt have any crazy ""whoa look at all of this tea!"" editing. 

Its just Blaire sharing her personal experience with J* thats honestly quite telling, and a good insight on his personality behind the scenes."
4841,2020-06-28 20:22:39,hhhxma,I think it's more so that he's using this proof to have a handle over people and is spreading it around as it suits him?
4842,2020-06-28 20:07:04,hhhxma,"I saw it as her truly feeling bad about being told this piece of information and not knowing what to do with it. It seems she doesn't have the recording herself. Maybe if she had had it, she would have shared some part of it, with a voice modifier? I'm trying to put myself in her shoes, is it better to make this video and show the world the vile person that jstar is, or to keep quiet and let him continue?"
4843,2020-06-28 19:11:10,hhhxma,"James felt so confident in his ""no more lies"" and he's been smiling and living his life recently. If it were true, I feel like he'd be more afraid. That or he's also great at manipulation"
4844,2020-06-28 19:30:22,hhhxma,"Im skeptical of the voice memo but we now have the moms basement podcast and now blaire saying about it, its starting to look more like its real. But frankly either way real or fake jeffree is disgusting like no matter what this situation isnt a good look for him. But if it is real surely it has to be one of the people jeffree mentions in his text to james that he shows in the no more lies video?"
4845,2020-06-29 03:06:16,hhhxma,Lmao. Jefferson!! That made my day. I am at the end of a 16hr shift. I needed it. Thank you!!
4846,2020-06-28 17:46:45,hhhxma,"The only person I feel bad for in this situation is the victim, who clearly did not want to be outed in this way."
4847,2020-06-28 18:14:32,hhhxma,"I think she said she reached out to the victim, not that they talked."
4848,2020-06-28 17:35:34,hhhxma,"Also it’s so terrible of Jeffree to keep showing this voice memo to people, while saying that it’s not his place to release the victims story. This person obviously trusted him with this information and Jeffree is spreading it round like gossip"
4849,2020-06-28 17:32:29,hhhxma,"Me too, I honestly don’t know what to think about anyone. I don’t understand why this is all being said on YouTube instead of going to the police??! These allegations are so serious why aren’t they being sorted behind the scenes? I appreciate her bringing up Shane too, but holy shit"
4850,2020-06-28 17:56:41,hhhxma,Why is no one going to the police if there's an alleged voice memo from a victim??
4851,2020-06-29 04:42:16,hhhxma,I thought their collab w/ J* was before Dramageddon 2?
4852,2020-07-14 04:13:32,hhhxma,"The sister squad fell apart before Dramageddon. They stopped making videos together since Christmas and that's why Emma and the twins didn't hang out with James at Coachella. I think Jeffree saw an opportunity to make it look as though the twins were on his side, so he set up that collab. I don't think the twins were necessarily on anyone's side, so they've just been staying out of everything."
4853,2020-06-28 23:21:20,hhhxma,"Has anyone made any connection with the content onision was making at that time too? Watching those old videos of Shane felt like I was watching an onision vid. Green screen, dressing up as a woman for the yuks, vile offensiveness being confused for edgy... I don't know what to think. It's similar behaviour however onision seemed to be more active in pursuing his fanbase."
4854,2020-06-28 23:40:32,hhhxma,"You're absolutely right. I'm quite sure Jafar Sultan is gonna be fine after all of this. After getting mainstream attention from the Smith family, hoo boy, I'd leave the face of the planet if it were me. It definitely doesn't look good. But JarJar over there can watch from the comfort of his own 30 ft pool. Blaire's video is the nail in the coffin."
4855,2020-06-30 02:58:36,hhhxma,"Shane was involved though. If you remember James Charles video, he has a screenshot of a text convo between him and Jeffree where Shane was brought up."

It was her putting in the light that JS is a pos and telling everyone on her platform so she no longer feels complicit by keeping the secret"
4859,2020-06-28 20:21:04,hhhxma,Fragile and sensitive is true but he's constantly using it as an excuse for the shit he does so idk if its that important
4860,2020-06-29 00:35:59,hhhxma,Even little kids know you treat people how you want to be treated. We are just treating him how he continues to treat everyone else.

4863,2020-06-28 18:47:58,hhhxma,"I just can't buy James being a rapist after his No More Lies video. People want genuine honesty, I think that's where theyll mostly find it. James had nothing to lose and I didn't sense one lie in that video 🤷‍♂️

4867,2020-06-29 19:59:28,hhhxma,"'calling out people' is a funny way of saying she believes there are only 2 genders,  is anti-feminist, defended roseanne barr, and has called black people the n-word among many things"

4872,2020-06-28 18:04:57,hhhxma,Thank you! Hopefully she doesn’t delete it before I can watch it.
4873,2020-06-29 00:16:02,hhhxma,"Blaire didn't speak to them. She didn't add credibility, only more of the same."
4874,2020-06-29 10:40:29,hhhxma,I think you may have misunderstood my comment! I meant it’s not her place to play the voice memo/detail what happened to the public when she could be unwillingly outting someone.
4875,2020-06-28 21:14:58,hhhxma,"Just because someone calls out that they’re not doing something doesn’t mean it’s not happening, lol. This is a common tool of manipulation. It’s cut from exactly the same cloth as narcissistic YTers who don’t know how to convey emotion for an apology video so they wear less makeup, play sombre music and shoot the video in a stripped back location. 

She’s not genuine at all, she’s built a career on throwing other transgender people under the bus for humilitainment. She bullied other transgender YT creators for their appearance for years (Riley Dennis being the prime example), and now she’s fixated on chronicling the life of an alleged child predator for money. She doesn’t have an authentic bone in her body."
4876,2020-06-28 20:36:04,hhhxma,Yes that I get. What I don’t get is why Blaire asked the audience what she should do with the information.... what any normal person would do... show it to the police. She doesn’t need to ask hat the right thing to do is. She knows the right thing.
4877,2020-06-28 20:06:03,hhhxma,"Thats was my impression too tbh, i also felt je was confident"

4881,2020-06-28 18:27:55,hhhxma,"Like how is Jeffree spreading someone being assaulted out like its TEA??? It's a crime, not the hot gossip of the moment."
4882,2020-06-28 18:00:11,hhhxma,"Yeah it’s really concerning. She mentioned the victim is too scared to come out so maybe that’s the reason but this has turned into a giant circus. Jefree star running round telling everyone a victims story and blackmailing others because “he has dirt on everyone” is so fucked up. 
I just hope the victim has the strength to come forward and go to the police. We can’t decide who’s guilty and who’s not over YouTube. I don’t know where to go from here"

4884,2020-06-29 04:50:35,hhhxma,"Nope. It was September, 2019...around the time of Shane's infomercial.

[Switching Lives With The Dolan Twins](https://youtu.be/Fzz6C5rXNTk)"
4885,2020-06-29 00:13:03,hhhxma,Not sure how much everyone on this sub knows since we're all different ages and likrly found Shane at different times in his career but Shane and Onision used to be friends. They collabed alllll the time. Theres a video of them kissing ( obviously before Shane was out of the closet) and it was a huge deal for the youtube community at the time
4886,2020-06-28 23:41:12,hhhxma,I had precisely the same thought.
4887,2020-06-29 01:28:25,hhhxma,You’re so dramatic. Makes your stomach twist? Lmao.
4888,2020-06-28 21:30:02,hhhxma,"I wouldn't go that far, he definitely deserves money. He put work into those videos and I felt entertained by them, most people did. Big companies are doing far worse shit but no one reacts so strongly."
4889,2020-06-28 21:30:48,hhhxma,Jeffree showing support for James on Twitter might have been a manipulation tactic. You know how Jeffree loves fucking with people. J* probably thought it would be fun to compliment James and then call him a predator two months later to push him over the edge.
4890,2020-06-29 16:10:25,hhhxma,"I don’t see that as surprising. Jeffree has no problems being friends with a predator, if it benefits him."
4891,2020-06-28 18:29:55,hhhxma,"Sorry, either I didn't see it or I'm failing to recall that. Can you link?"
4892,2020-06-28 19:40:00,hhhxma,"I've never heard her say ""black women are cockroaches"". Link or proof?"

4894,2020-06-29 04:23:22,hhhxma,I need proof of this
4895,2020-06-29 13:15:02,hhhxma,Bitch when
4896,2020-06-29 20:04:14,hhhxma,She's also called black people the n-word and defended roseanne barr
4897,2020-06-30 03:00:06,hhhxma,Let's just make shit up while we're at it.
4898,2020-06-28 18:38:16,hhhxma,"She thought Riley was assuming the trans identity without actually being trans. Also, Riley had said some pretty ridiculous things and Blaire took issue with that. When Riley came out about being on hormones, Blaire made a video where she apologized for invalidating Riley's identity."
4899,2020-06-28 21:38:44,hhhxma,"Blaire is trash but the „if he aint aryan we aint marryin“ one was a popular meme that went round twitter/tumblr at the time. It was making fun of the alt right, not endorsing them."
4900,2020-06-28 20:00:15,hhhxma,It's crazy to me how the bgc sunreddit has been bashing her for the past two hours. Apparently J* paid her so that people who turn against JC again... Smh
4901,2020-06-29 00:15:00,hhhxma,"Just a heads up, the person who replied to you gave a bit of an inaccurate summary. Blaire messaged the person the memo was about but they didn't respond, so she hasn't spoken with them. Also she doesn't show the alleged memo. She just says j* played it to her."
4902,2020-06-29 10:41:42,hhhxma,"It's all good then, since she specified she doesn't want to put the victim in a position where they are pressured to come out, she's in fact doing all this in good faith"
4903,2020-06-28 21:19:34,hhhxma,"She never threw “other transgender people under the bus”. She was calling out the trenders and the crazy TRAs that gave a bad look to the trans community. Blaire assuming Riley Dennis wasn’t trans was a shitty thing to do but she’s made amends with her and has grown from that experience. 

Also, saying she only does the predator hunting videos for money is fucking rude. The reason she does it is bc she never got justice for her own rape so she wants to help others. That and the whole “SJW feminist wreckt” schtick got old after 2017 so of course she had to change her content up. She’s a hero and a voice for the LGBT community and those who have faced assault."
4904,2020-07-01 14:19:04,hhhxma,She can't do that though? She's not the victim or the abuser therefore it doesn't mean anything to the police. A lot of people think you can do that but in most cases you can't
4905,2020-06-28 22:54:34,hhhxma,"I wouldn't take that as evidence that JC didn't do anything wrong. It's eerily reminiscent of the Jeffree and Dahvie Vanity situation. Jeffree falls out with Dahvie/James, publicly accuses them of being predators, then when it makes more monetary sense to be on their good side, he makes nice and recants his accusations. With Dahvie, they all turned out to be true. This either means Jeffree lied to take down a competitor, which I find less likely since Dahvie was so regularly assaulting people that Jeffree almost positively saw inappropriate behaviour, we even have video evidence of Jeffree being around Dahvie while he acted sexually inappropriately with minors, or he did see something and used it to his advantage, until he willingly put people in danger to further his own career a year later. 

If the latter is true, then that means there's a possibility that James really did hurt someone, or someone behind the scenes has accused him of it, and it's within character for Jeffree to use or discard that information with no regard for the victim, depending on what's best for himself. I'm not sure what I believe, but idk if it's wise to base any belief in Jeffree's moral compass, he really would kiss a predator's ass to further his own career"
4906,2020-06-28 22:09:45,hhhxma,"Nope, she just said jeffree played her the voice note on facetime."
4907,2020-06-28 18:11:20,hhhxma,Same. I'm going to stick to my haunted Tik Tok videos from now.
4908,2020-06-28 18:07:29,hhhxma,What if they're a minor? An adult can make their own choice to go to the police but knowing a minor was assaulted or molested and not taking it to the proper authorities seems wrong.
4909,2020-06-29 01:43:17,hhhxma,"Yeah! That is what is connecting some dots for me. I am probably of an older demo and have experienced the Jeffree star MySpace era first hand. I agree in some aspects with Shane saying that it was a little bit of an arms race on who could be the more 'edgy', offensive, damaged soul on the internet. Not justifying it but just helping to contextualised the internet at that time. At least in my circles - that was a thing . But something doesn't feel right about that past relationship with onision, it's too doppleganger for me. And THAT is what is making me suspect that something deeper is happened here. It's almost like Shane stepped out at some point and away from that onision-esque method of producing content. Saying I hold my friends to a lower standard than others makes me wonder... if Shane is falling on his sword for Jeffrey what did he ignore with onision? I don't genuinely believe that Shane is intentionally going out to hurt anyone..but sometimes your actions hurt people all the same. And if you lie with dogs your bound to bring home fleas."
4910,2020-06-28 22:57:23,hhhxma,"Having read your comment history, your opinion is not surprising"
4911,2020-06-28 23:02:34,hhhxma,It's not because others do worse that what he's doing is ok.
4912,2020-06-28 23:39:22,hhhxma,No. It speaks volumes that a white person can get away with this for so long and become a multi millionaire profiting off people of color being the butt of the joke. He doesn’t deserve the money he has

4915,2020-06-28 18:56:58,hhhxma,"I’m aware she apologized for it. It doesn’t change the fact that Blaire was punching down on someone who 1) had a smaller channel than her and 2) did not conform to trans womanhood in the same ways that Blaire had. 

Blaire’s whole shtick during that era of her channel was the “dumb SJW gets own with facts and logic”, with specialization in “person XYZ is a BAD trans person, look Alt Right, I’m a GOOD trans person, now please give me some human rights”. 

It seems like she was afraid that her status as a trans woman was being tarnished by other trans women or enbies/gender non conforming people who gave the community “a bad look”, and she lashed out. I don’t agree with a lot of the things Riley says or has said in the past, but Blaire was fucking cruel to her."
4916,2020-06-28 20:06:07,hhhxma,Wowzers. People are paranoid
4917,2020-06-28 20:15:12,hhhxma,"Yeah. I try to listen to multiple perspectives as often as possible, but seeing people bash one of my favorite YouTubers with little prompting in comment after comment after comment is disheartening"
4918,2020-06-29 10:42:33,hhhxma,Yeah exactly. I was meaning to reply to a comment that had said something along the lines of what’s the point of her saying anything if she doesnt show the proof. I guess it didn’t go through as a reply but as it’s own comment.
4919,2020-06-28 21:26:47,hhhxma,"Her entire career is built on holding herself out as the “not like other transgender people” YTer to self-protect from transphobia rife in the right-wing circles she surrounds herself with. I used to love Blair until I confronted the reality that she routinely employs mean girl tactics to attack other people based on their appearance rather than any credible critique of their behaviour. 

Right, so please explain to me how following an alleged child predator’s makeup routine online is achieving justice for her own r*pe?"

4923,2020-06-28 22:17:12,hhhxma,Have you seen the creepy randonauting ones??
4924,2020-06-29 01:50:53,hhhxma,100% agree. I had always made up the story in my head that Shane realized Onision was toxic and cut him out of his life. Now I'm not so sure and the whole thing makes me uneasy.
4925,2020-06-29 04:25:06,hhhxma,The problem is that back then he didn't make tons of money and most of he has he earned during the last three years.
4926,2020-06-28 21:52:28,hhhxma,Tbh I think he’s just trying to fuck with James. I bet James felt really fucking confused and manipulated when J* complimented him - that’s J*’s goal and endgame. He wants to mess with his head to the point where he’ll be back in a dark place again
4927,2020-06-29 03:24:52,hhhxma,"She made a video recently (I think she was in a hot tub or something) where she revisited her opinions on her old content and the people involved. There were some really positive things said about most of them, including Riley. I’ll admit I liked watching some of the SJW takedowns, but it was nice seeing a classier version of Blaire."
4928,2020-06-28 19:58:06,hhhxma,I haven't watched anything about Blair and Riley but I'm curious : what's your opinion on her videos about Jessica Yaniv?
4929,2020-06-28 23:47:17,hhhxma,"I wouldn’t worry about what BGC says too much ... I had to unsubscribe from that sub because of the toxicity and hate hard-on that sub has. They loveeeee to hate anyone and they circle-jerk J*, Jay-sus. I take everything they say about everyone with a serious grain of salt, it’s a sub of haters."
4930,2020-06-28 21:35:10,hhhxma,"She doesn’t do that though? Blaire used to be conservative (she’s center now) and branded herself as a conservative transwoman. By doing that, she did not “throw other trans people under the bus”. The reason she covered the crazy TRAs was to show a more conservative audience that not all trans people are like that and that trans people can be distinguished and articulate (like Blaire). For instance, she got my dad to accept trans people. He was never transphobic by any means but had qualms about trans topics but when he discovered Blaire, it helped him realize that there’s nothing wrong with trans people. Her sole purpose back then was to show conservatives that not all trans people are the crazy Jessica Yaniv’s you see in the media - they’re real people.

Though I will agree in you, the JY video was in bad taste. She should’ve ended the JY saga after the video before the makeup one but idk what she was thinking doing that. That being said, she has helped me a lot with my own assault experience (both in her videos and in private messages Ive had with her), so I will always admire her despite having different political views than her."
4931,2020-06-29 00:16:02,hhhxma,"My point is I wouldn't discredit it based on the assertion that Jeffree wouldn't make nice with a predator, because he has made nice with predators in order to further his career before. That doesn't mean it's credible that James did or didn't do it, my point is that regardless of whether or not he did do it, Jeffree would act in whatever what benefitted him the most regardless"

4937,2020-06-28 20:10:37,hhhxma,"I actually kinda like the turn that Blaire’s channel has taken in trying to exposure predators. Yaniv seems like they need serious help, whether they truly identify as trans or they’re using it as a ploy to continue predatory behavior. Her fight against Onison is something I’m 100% here for as well. 

I have a complicated relationship with Blaire’s channel tbh. I don’t think that her voice should be erased just because she’s a conservative woman, even though I largely disagree with most of her political stances, but she blatantly panders to (or used to at least) to Alt Right shit heads. 

Her interview with Ben Shapiro is just fucking sad in my opinion. She doesn’t hammer her very valid points about presentation all the way in bc her and Shapiro have to take a break every two seconds to praise one another about how civil they’re being. She’s definitely more suited to call out videos on particular problematic people than the pseudo political commentary vids imo"
4938,2020-06-28 22:07:36,hhhxma,"That's great that she's had a positive impact on your life, but her whole slant on ""48 genders / non-binary / transtrenders don't REALLY represent us"" is stoking the flames of transphobia, not improving it. Hint: the reason transphobes hate trans people isn't because of people who don't fit neatly into the gender binary like she does--it's because they hate trans people.

Look, I'm a gay person from a very conservative pocket of the world, and I get it. Early on in realising that I wasn't straight, I gravitated towards LBGTQI YouTubers who decried ""bad gays"", because the only representation I'd ever seen in the media of gay people were as caricatures, comic relief, or sexual predators. I tried to distance myself as much as possible from that image, because I wasn't one of *them*.

Then one day, I realised that I sought out this media as a form of self-soothing for my own internalised homophobia. As I met more and more LGBTQI people with varying perspectives, I realised there was a place for many different shapes and sizes of queer people, which allowed me to accept myself for who I am.

Who the fuck *cares* if there are cringey TikTok teens who identify as 212 genders? Why does it *matter* that a trans woman early in her transition doesn't present as femininely as some others? It has absolutely zero impact on mine or anybody else's lives, and I don't understand why other people are so intent on policing other people's happiness.

I'm disappointed that, in Blaire's Riley Dennis apology video, she realised she was subjecting Riley to the same shit she went through, and that it was just a reflection of how she felt about herself, before going straight back to her bullying bullshit. I think that realisation goes to explaining the motives of queer people seeking out and creating humilitainment content (including myself when I started coming out)—we desperately try to distract from what we feel about ourselves by seeking it out in other people as scapegoats."

4945,2020-06-28 21:56:30,hhhxma,"I know, but we need to look at it deeper. J* is a grade a manipulator and probably wanted to fuck with James psyche again"
4946,2020-06-28 20:18:18,hhhxma,"Her videos about Yaniv are the only ones I've seen from her so I'm trying to understand the hatred she's getting (not from you, in general). I feel like nowadays people alienate people who have different opinions. There's no more discussion and debate, it's just ""she voted for Trump so she's trash"". But at the same time, I don't usually watch her videos, so I don't want to go to bat for someone who might actually be a white supremacist (which is what she's being called on the bgc sub)."
4947,2020-06-28 23:36:03,hhhxma,"I guess we can agree to disagree. I was in a similar phase where I thought being gay and conservative was edgy and the move but I’m grown and reformed now. That being said, I don’t see Blaire as the boogeyman of trans rights people make her out to be -  I think she does more good than harm despite making some really bad mistakes."
4948,2020-06-29 01:25:58,hhhxma,[deleted]
4949,2020-06-28 19:14:05,hhhxma,"I would recommend nothing more than getting some microwaveable mac and cheese, iced tea, and watching her videos. And, in case you're wondering, she has retweeted Jaden & Jada calling out Shane and has not defended him (to my knowledge)"
4950,2020-06-28 22:41:52,hhhxma,"My grandma said ""ESTUPDIA PENDAJAS GOING OUT INTO THE WOODS. DON'T YOU EVER DO THAT MIJA!"" So I think she would agree with you"
4951,2020-06-30 03:05:10,hhhxma,He's a narcissist sociopath.
4952,2020-06-28 20:38:14,hhhxma,"I totally get where you’re coming from. [This](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Blaire_White) site has a good compilation of some of the problematic things she’s done. I wouldn’t go as far to say that she’s a white supremacist, but she certainly runs in the same crowd. I know she was assaulted at a rally against Trump for wearing a MAGA hat, which is absolutely fucked up, but I doubt she still supports him after the shit show that has been 2020.  I don’t use twitter or instagram, so I can’t say for sure.

Idk. I’m a staunch leftist but I try to take in as many different POVs as possible. People are complicated, as are all of the issues we face in the world. I feel like Blaire has a tendency to simplify a lot of the issues she speaks about (childhood transitioning, bathroom bills, etc), but I try to make an effort to listen regardless."
4953,2020-06-29 00:25:12,hhhxma,"A year after Trump was elected she actually made a video going over the things he's done that she doesn't agree with, so I'm sure she's got some things to say about his decisions in 2020"
4954,2020-06-28 20:46:35,hhhxma,"Thanks, I think you have the right attitude. I'll check out this website. :)"

4956,2020-06-28 13:48:26,hhd2x7,"The only defense for Shane's behavior is that it was so long ago and it's not a big deal or whatever, but considering Blaire she's actually going to try to justify it."
4957,2020-06-29 12:44:52,hhd2x7,"I don't know why Blaire White of all people, would have any business getting involved in this. She should know what type of people are involved in this drama. It's full of nasty and manipulative people that can only result in more drama and hurt. It's not really her place to mention that there is a rape victim involved and have zero evidence. I really think she's being played by Jeffree here. Stay out of it."
4958,2020-06-28 18:00:05,hhd2x7,Good thing she called him out and said his actions were abhorrent! You guys should expect more from her.
4959,2020-06-29 12:47:31,hhd2x7,"Bruh she's a trash racist like Jeffree and Shane, of course she'd get involved."
4960,2020-06-28 18:10:22,hhd2x7,My bad I wasn't expecting that! Pleasantly surprised.
4961,2020-06-29 14:12:14,hhd2x7,"LOL of course, and she gotta make money somehow. It seems she wants to catch the drama while it's still hot by dropping a bombshell of a claim. I guarantee you that she's using Shane as an excuse to get involved since she's friends with him. But Shane does deserve to get criticized for the racist and extreme pedo jokes. I get she's trying to ""defame"" Jeffree Star because he isn't getting taken down like Shane is. But she shot herself in the foot by mentioning that James Charles might have raped someone. With 0 evidence. Jeffree knew she would do this and I'm sure he's laughing that the attention is being diverted onto James Charles."
4962,2020-06-28 18:12:41,hhd2x7,No worries. She’s clearly in her redemption arc era anyways so her calling out Shane definitely didn’t surprise me. It’s evident that she’s trying to slowly improve as a person (ex: her donating to various black businesses during the riots and not being as right leaning as she used to be).
4963,2020-06-28 18:15:42,hhd2x7,"Nah fam, she's a grifter trying to keep her name of there. She just released a video claiming she has exclusive """"receipts"""" on Jeffree Star. Don't buy it."
4964,2020-06-28 18:16:41,hhd2x7,"The receipts were exclusive though, given that we had no idea J* is saying there are other YouTubers than James who are alleged rapists."
4965,2020-06-28 18:17:43,hhd2x7,"Blaire isn't a credible person and I again stress, this is her grift to stay relevant. She's defending Shane whose behavior is inexcusable."
4966,2020-06-28 18:22:02,hhd2x7,She’s not defending Shane. She just uploaded a video of her crying about how she doesn’t want to lose a friend (Shane) but she feels like it’s the right thing to do considering she exposes predators and doesn’t feel comfortable having a predator as a friend. She’s against Shane.
4967,2020-06-28 18:22:28,hhd2x7,Again. I don't buy it.
4968,2020-06-28 18:24:00,hhd2x7,And that’s okay! Honestly it’s weird being friends with Blaire and also being a reformed chud turned socialist leftist bc I’m stuck in between a rock and a hard place - I can see why people hate her but I also want to defend her sometimes 💀
4969,2020-06-28 18:25:28,hhd2x7,"There's nothing to defend about her. 
You're defending a Trump supporter, transphobic person who isn't worth it."
4970,2020-06-28 18:28:21,hhd2x7,"I don’t defend her for supporting Trump or any of that but it’s small instances where I recognize I still have love for her. I’ve been friends with her for close to two years and she’s helped me with a lottttt (most notably my assault and getting me off the ledge), so she’s someone I’ll always care about (but call out when needed) despite me not being anything close to right-leaning anymore."
4971,2020-06-28 18:30:10,hhd2x7,"Yeah ok, that's a lot of excuses for a bad person. Good luck to you."
4972,2020-06-28 18:30:39,hhd2x7,Bad person is subjective but ok ✌️
4973,2020-06-28 18:31:19,hhd2x7,That's a spicy centrist take. Cute.

Like Shane does not have good skin and I would never take skincare advice from him. How is he branded as a skincare influencer just because he did some bad makeup video with JS 30 years ago? Dude doesn't even wash his face every day.

Edit- lol fuck. Should’ve watched that video first"

4987,2020-06-28 12:57:57,hhczzc,"Perhaps this is a way they destroy Shane’s reputation and account because he enraged the Illuminati and Dasani etc . with his conspiracy videos
So they have to take away his platform... maybe they fear he will start analyzing 2020 so they have to mute him before he says anything that makes everyone else know what they don’t want everyone to know

Just a thought, hope it makes sense."
4988,2020-06-28 21:31:08,hhczzc,"To me, all he's ever been known as was the guy who made edgy ""comedy"" videos. So it's hilarious to see him trying to wiggle his way out of this since he's apparently no longer making edgy ""comedy"" videos."
4989,2020-06-28 15:09:05,hhczzc,"Didn’t he also fuck his cat or something? Like 70% of the popular YouTubers are all weirdos or rapists 
Or both💀"

All that needs to be said. Now can you imagine what a gamer YouTube gets into? Almost always they get hit with a rape accusation or two. 

And yes, the story is that he raped and ejaculated on his feline companion. Dogs must be to whïtê wœmēn as cats are to effeminate male culture warriors."

5081,2020-06-28 20:44:26,hhczzc,He also has said some incredibly inappropriate things to his 12 year old cousin. This [thread](https://mobile.twitter.com/misshemlock/status/1276465876607229952) has a couple examples of it. I understand making an edgy joke and I very rarely support canceling someone because everyone has said racist or offensive shit in the past. I just do not understand this pattern of behavior surrounding pedophilia. I really do think that he might be a pedophile because of how often he talks about it and the complete lack of boundaries he has children
5082,2020-06-29 09:21:08,hhczzc,"""It's just a bit"" people say lmao 

Yeah well you gotta realize at some point if your bit is justifying beating your one eyed snake to children, people might start to think you actually jack off to children."

5087,2020-06-29 22:09:11,hhczzc,Im pretty sure he uploaded his conscience onto a computer and now just lives as a 3d rendered version of himself onto his only fans? Saves heaps of money on food bills.
5088,2020-06-28 20:51:01,hhczzc,His conspiracy videos are garbage. The one where he spliced up footage of a human trafficking survivor telling her story with a conspiracy about Chuck E. Cheese pizza being recycled was embarrassing
5089,2020-06-29 03:19:48,hhczzc,What are you talking about I can't think of a bigger threat to the lluminati than some effeminate pedo who jizzes on his cat

5108,2020-06-28 17:08:04,hhczzc,He legitimately thinks kids are nothing more than something to get off to. Can’t wait to see him burn lol

5110,2020-06-29 05:21:02,hhczzc,"the thing is.. if it was actually *funny* it probably could’ve been forgiven. i was a shane dawson fan since i was 13, and even i think it’s just creepy and unfunny. lots of comedians use dark humour and it actually works. but being an edgelord doesn’t automatically make you funny. do i think he’s a pedo? i don’t know. i don’t know what goes on in his head. but every single video that’s resurfaced just wasn’t funny."
5111,2020-06-29 07:28:15,hhczzc,"I also thought he was an edgelord until I saw all the video clips on a large Twitter thread by @misshemlock. It shows literal child abuse and it’s sickening. He asks for and receives a lap dance from a 12 year old cousin on video. He feeds dick shaped cookies to a little girl on video. There are accounts from girls who met him at meet and greets between 11 & 13 years old and he grabbed them, telling one “good girl” when she said she was uncomfortable but didn’t leave. He’s an outright pedophile and I hope there’s some way this guy faces actual criminal charges."

5177,2020-08-19 14:34:38,icoplp,You’re saying “we” like any of us actually care about her
5178,2020-08-19 14:38:56,icoplp,We bought tickets to her movies and that failed her?
5179,2020-08-19 14:35:24,icoplp,God I hate TMZ zombies.
5180,2020-08-19 14:33:35,icoplp,"There’s no “we”. I don’t owe celebrities anything, nor do i give any sort of fucks about them"
5181,2020-08-19 14:33:15,icoplp,"She is not even close to the most hated.

She's a mediocre actress who does shitty movies with entirely forgettable performances.  I haven't spared a single thought on Megan Fox *at all* in years.  I don't hate her; I don't *anything* her."
5182,2020-08-19 14:32:14,icoplp,I didn’t fail her. I had nothing to do with any of this
5183,2020-08-19 14:41:20,icoplp,"She's not that hated. She made it this far on hotness only, she can't complain THAT much"
5184,2020-08-19 14:54:41,icoplp,"She was a moment of hype during the Transformers era. At that moment in time renounced as one of the sexiest woman alive. Then Jennifers body was… Interesting. And something about her thumbs apparently look like toes...

But ultimately *we* didn’t fail shit. The moment you follow your dreams and become a celebrity is the moment that you take full responsibility of your career and life. Now she’s dating machine gun Kelly, and I honestly completely forgot about her all these years in between. 

Because she didn’t keep her career alive.  In the way the entertainment business works; if you don’t constantly prove yourself to Hollywood you were going to be a distant memory. I take no accountability in what Megan fox did or didn’t do with her career."
5185,2020-08-19 15:01:27,icoplp,No we didn't. I most certainly didn't. I don't care what she did behind the screen but she's a shit actor and I don't like her work very much
5186,2020-08-19 15:28:57,icoplp,"I don’t hate Megan fox, I have literally no opinion about her."
5187,2020-08-19 16:28:09,icoplp,"I didn't get the memo regarding this inclusive ""we""

Is there a Social Society to join which involves the care-taking duties of celebrities?

And what's with the what-aboutism with the other actors? That's not my call for who gets work. How did I get put into this inclusive ""we"" ?

""Never mind that young girls are implicitly given the green light to think of other young attractive women as sluts"" - Who? Where? What is a *slut* anymore? I was told a slut is an attractive woman who won't sleep with the man in question, or she has slept with a man that the man who is stating the word thinks is beneath both of them. Thus it's a slur because she did the deed with a loser. Which means she has terrible mate selection choices.

As for the ""Sex Object"" ? If someone did not keep up with her after Transformers? Or that one movie where she had those little wings and was in the chair with the guy - yeah.  
Art is an Object That Speaks. The film/movies with her is a testimony of her sexual beauty. That's it. (Unless you took the time out to watch Jennifer's Body)

Also the Hitler comment was funny, to me. Directors can be terrible to work with.

Regardless, have a pleasing day."
5188,2020-08-19 14:36:51,icoplp,Most of it is jealousy. But her ditching her husband and kids to hang out with MGK doesn’t help.  America loves to tear someone down.  She got insanely popular overnight for her looks and that made a lot of people into haters especially since she’s not a particularly good actress. But that’s not her fault and no reason to hate.
5189,2020-08-19 14:34:35,icoplp,I didnt fail anybody. Her career sucks because she sucks. She can't act for shit and she isn't good looking at all.
5190,2020-08-19 14:38:13,icoplp,"Wanna know why ""we"" failed Megan Fox, its the same reason shit like ""WAP"" is such a popular song."
5191,2020-08-19 14:43:59,icoplp,"Lmfao immediately seven comments hating on her and telling you she’s not hated. 

It’s clear people have always resented her for being attractive and not a generational acting talent, as if that’s somehow her fault or makes her a bad person."
5192,2020-08-20 23:27:06,icoplp,"She was 20 at the time of filming Transformers. She was 15 when she got busted for shoplifting at a Wal-Mart. Get your facts straight before you use them, otherwise your argument is nullified. You were trying to make Bay seem like a pedophile using an erroneous statement. Not to mention that she hated the experience of bending over that old Camaro in the first movie so much that she came back to film the second movie."
5193,2020-09-06 17:27:46,icoplp,"I admit she's overhated and that her acting wasn't terrible. Yet, her acting wasn't that great either.

Micheal Bay is trash though."
5194,2020-08-21 18:03:52,icoplp,"You're right, she was 20 at the time of filming Transformers. But she was 15 in the filming of aforementioned waterfall scene in ""Bad Boys 2"" directed by Bay. Also she was probably contracted for the second movie...and if not contractually obliged, the seven figure salary didn't hurt. She's gone on record to say how she hated being over-sexualized by the media so early on in her career."
5195,2020-08-22 03:10:08,icoplp,"I would say the guilty party lies more with her parents and her agent than with Bay or Hollywood. If she really hated Bay so much and even if she was already contracted for the follow up movie, why come back and film 2 TMNT movies by Bay?"

5197,2020-08-19 01:01:08,icdm79,I am too sleepy to read through all of this properly but I skimmed through and you seem like a nice fella Ryan. You have my most heartfelt recommendation for anyone looking for a friend.
5198,2020-08-19 00:15:32,iccrx6,"if you’re fine supporting a racist who also supports a pedophile, then go ahead. Just know that by definition, that makes you a racist."
5199,2020-08-19 00:21:49,iccrx6,Sorry that you're tired of being vilified for *supporting a racist.*
5200,2020-08-19 00:53:54,iccrx6,"There are so many other purple based palettes that have a wider selection of shades that better represent what that color story should've been, for a better price or from brands who aren't owned by a racist or that are flat out better quality.

I used to purchase from JSC. His eyeshadows are NOT the end all be all, not even close. The colourpop formula is better, the ABH Norvina palettes are SIGNIFICANTLY better. Some shades in his palettes are good but often there are shades that are pressed so hard and have next to no pigment. 

Based solely on the fact that you're making this highly defensive post, you clearly *do* care what others say. If you didn't you would've just bought it and moved on with your day. But again, I can promise you, you'll probably be disappointed if you do buy it."
5201,2020-08-19 00:14:29,iccrx6,"Personally, if you want the palette, then get it.  Like you said, it's your money.  The palette looks good.  Everyone has an opinion but yours is the one that counts in this situation.  Enjoy!"
5202,2020-08-19 00:39:50,iccrx6,"You seem like you do care about people bringing it up that you’re fiscally supporting a misogynistic racist who has a history of being a genuinely not good person. Just be quiet about it and enjoy lining his already overstuffed pockets.

People always bring up that Joffrey Starch is a bad dude because he’s a bad dude, not because of some over sensitive feelings. He’s a manipulative monster, end of story."

5219,2020-08-17 15:32:13,ibg9v6,The last two palettes he released were very bleh to me. I remember first getting into makeup and thinking the blood sugar and blue blood palettes were stunning though. I like the newer purple one as well but something about his shadows makes my eyes water more than any other brand.
5220,2020-08-17 15:43:08,ibg9v6,"I’m not about it but I think it was very clever of him to put all the mattes and all the shimmers in two separate palettes, therefore forcing his stans to buy both products."
5221,2020-08-17 16:47:04,ibg9v6,Why would you get ripped? Most people don’t care for Jeffree.
5222,2020-08-17 17:07:53,ibg9v6,"Even if it wasn't created by a racist pedophile apologist who treats women and minorities like shit, I still wouldn't want it. 

It's...it's a lot of shades I already have with other palettes. I just see no need for it and don't find it aesthetically pleasing. 


Plus he's a garbage human being."
5223,2020-08-17 15:39:16,ibg9v6,"I dislike him very much for his racial prejudices but, I like his new orgy palette. I’ve never liked any other line of his. If someone else made it I would buy it!! I wear nudes all the time so, it’s good for me."
5224,2020-08-17 17:22:54,ibg9v6,I don’t get the hype. Its literally just a 50 shades of brown palette lmao its been done by nearly every brand out there 🤷‍♀️
5225,2020-08-17 15:32:03,ibg9v6,I feel like the creamated palette is very.. idk. I’m not a huge makeup person since I’m just starting to get into it. But I find it a little bland
5226,2020-08-17 16:39:31,ibg9v6,Why do you like Jeffree though
5227,2020-08-17 16:44:03,ibg9v6,I actually think the colors are pretty but I have never and will never support Jeffery star.
5228,2020-08-17 17:26:13,ibg9v6,There’s a pretty extensive thread discussing orgy on r/beautyguruchatter if you want to check it out for more people’s thoughts.
5229,2020-08-17 21:09:45,ibg9v6,It's literally just Colourpop's Bare Necessities with a hefty price tag.
5230,2020-08-17 17:51:03,ibg9v6,The new palette should had definitely only been like a 12 or 16 Pan. Lots of the same shades. Same with Cremated. I bought it and was very disappointed in the shades. Won’t be buying the new one at all.
5231,2020-08-17 19:00:51,ibg9v6,"The palette seems massive, like who could ever finish even half of that within a few years??"
5232,2020-08-17 19:03:01,ibg9v6,I think he could’ve done better and it was completely underwhelming. I like a nude palette with mattes and shimmers. There’s so many other nude palettes I’d rather have than this one.
5233,2020-08-17 17:31:05,ibg9v6,"I find it boring and safe. He's too problematic for me to support in any capacity anymore, but from what I hear and from what lip product gifts I've tried in the past, his makeup line's quality has always been solid. But where he shines is his unique color selection, which this all nudes work lacks.

Regardless, his propensity to supplement good marketing with drama is a toxic habit I just can't justify financially supporting."
5234,2020-08-17 17:25:00,ibg9v6,He is an ugly person so it makes sense. They are loud and obnoxious like his toxic ass.
5235,2020-08-17 21:38:25,ibg9v6,"His brand is very replaceable nowadays. Especially his new palette, looks okay but why’d you need so many shades of nude? Most of them are gonna look exactly the same on most people’s skin. If I wanted the same vibes I’d go for the coconuts palette by Colourpop."
5236,2020-08-17 17:43:11,ibg9v6,"I made this post to get opinions on Jeffree stars newest palette and to ask what the thoughts were on his old palettes. I want to make it painfully clear that I’m not saying people can’t support him. Nor am I ripping you apart if you do. I literally just wanted to see how other people think about the palettes. If you took the time to comment negative shit that no one asked for, you need to grow up and find another forum to kiss ass on🤷🏼‍♀️. For all the comments about the palettes themselves, I thank you for not turning this into a huge argument (:"
5237,2020-08-17 18:20:22,ibg9v6,"Until conspiracy I was able to say I hadn't bought any j* palettes, but I got sucked into the hype and regretted the purchase almost immediately after receiving the package. I have since depotted and repressed the shades ill actually use and thrown away the rest. I definitely get what you mean that it feels like the colors just have no sense to them, and I felt that way about jawbreaker as well. I also don't like the alien, orgy, or cremated palettes because theyre just too big. It seems like any palette with more than like, 15 shades is susceptible to ending up with shade repeats, especially when its supposed to be on a continuous spectrum like cremated and orgy. I dunno. He won't be getting any more of my money and I regret giving him any at all. There are better brands with comparable shadow quality that I'll use in the future."
5238,2020-08-17 18:44:18,ibg9v6,"don't like him, don't support him. I think his aesthetic (packaging) is trashy and cheap, but his makeup is beyond amazing.

it took me a long time to realize what a pos he is, so I bought two of his liquid lipsticks. I hate the way they look, but the formula is amazing and I truly enjoy them. most people will disagree with me, but his last palette (the grey one) is right up my ally, and I had a moment of weakness when I drooled all over this palette's shades. didn't buy it, though. the price is way too high (why add so many unnecessary shades?) and I can no longer buy from him without feeling like I'm giving up on my morals. 

I really wish his fans will sober up one day... I hope this moment is just around the corner."
5239,2020-08-17 19:16:09,ibg9v6,"I don't think his palettes are ugly, just not my style. I love seeing all sorts of bright and/or editorial looks on other people, but think my own face is better suited for more subtle colors. I do have the Cremated palette though and friggin love it. Gray is one of my favorite colors, I love cool toned eye shadows, so I about exploded with excitement when I saw the launch vid for it lol. His lipsticks on the other hand, a lot of those colors I do think are hideous."
5240,2020-08-17 17:04:27,ibg9v6," I have personally not tried any of his palettes, so I cannot comment on their quality. I have not seen a release that I like for me. Either the colors are too bright or too dark. This last release is the one I find more appealing, but the name of the shades and the nudity in the packaging put me off.. I know.. I´m weird  :-P I also don´t like the strange feeling of somehow being forced to buy two palettes because the shimmers have been made into a different set."
5241,2020-08-17 16:17:06,ibg9v6,"I may not have a popular opinion but here’s my take.

Jeffree is a businessman through and through. I do think he’s coming away from brighter colored palettes with Orgy and Cremated for good measure. He’s being more inclusive to people who want a new or toned-down look, can’t wear or aren’t comfortable using vibrant colors. I think the color story with Cremated works and is versatile to consumers wearing smoked out dramatic, or buildable makeup looks.

I like Cremated because again you can add color to it or use it as is. One of the glitters in it is by far one of the best I’ve used. The grays look the same but they didn’t lay down that way for me. 

I am on the fence with Orgy because I already own way too many palettes and makeup in general and the price point is ticking upward more and more.

Being a businessman, Jeffree thrives on recent purchasing power: He had the Cremated launch, semi-annual sale, major restocks, and now the new Orgy launch soon. It doesn’t sound like the Orgy color story will prevent the money from flowing in either. 🤷‍♀️"
5242,2020-08-17 20:02:46,ibg9v6,"Let's ignore the elephant in the room that is Jeff's shitty behavior and talk about the makeup for a sec. It's really hard to know what the on-skin colors and quality are going to be like until someone does an independent review. Morphe keeps churning out giant all-brown palettes like every other week, so there must be a market for that sort of thing.  Jeff may not know how to act like a decent human, but he does know how to make and sell makeup.

I do have some of Jeff's older palettes and the quality is very good. Before dramageddon hit, a lot of people honestly didn't realize what they were supporting. I didn't. Fortunately, there are tons of other great indy brands out there to support instead.

I guess just buy the makeup you find pretty that is also not produced by a human shitstain?"
5243,2020-08-17 21:41:17,ibg9v6,"Jafar has started believing his own press releases. He actually thinks we want an overpriced Morphe palette with his ass hanging out and a name that makes even adults go WTF. 

I'm starting to think he really is as tacky and tasteless as he comes across and that he used his ""friendships"" as a way to get product ideas. 

Look at Manny, for an example. Since going solo Manny has come out with products that are great quality* and have really pretty packaging. Jafar on the other hand, has not being getting the same reactions. It seems like since he's been solo he's been putting out consistently worse and worse releases, culminating in this extravaganza of bland.  

*Based on what I've heard/read."
5244,2020-08-17 18:11:41,ibg9v6,"I was eh about this palette, the cremated one, and controversy and mini controversy. I do really like blood sugar, blue blood, jawbreaker and mini jawbreaker and the blood lust palette. I also have thirsty bc I really liked the color story but I haven’t touched it yet - I didn’t know they were discontinued until the last minute and managed to snag one and was torn if I was going to sell it or not. I may grab the liquid lip vault from the Orgy collection but that’s it, if I even do that. I know he says it’s an artistry palette but I was a bit disappointed at how many light shades there were - I feel like he could’ve kept it to one row and had another row that was more of a variation in medium/darker nude tones.

Although a lot of people here will downvote anyone that likes his stuff, I will say that IMO his eyeshadow formula is really nice and his liquid lipstick formula is one of my favorites. 

Seeing his collections and how he does some of his formulas and packaging does give me perspective when it comes to other brands - I’m a huge makeup collector/addict and have an embarrassing amount of stuff and it’s interesting to see him put out the stuff at the prices he does - for example the extreme frost highlighter that came with the blood lust collection comes in this gorgeous vegan leather box - the way he does his packaging and some of the details is nice (IMO) yet I don’t feel like I’m paying an arm and a leg more for it. I’m a sucker for cute/nice packaging though so there’s that."
5245,2020-08-17 20:08:49,ibg9v6,"I think the only palette from J* cosmetics that I've found remotely interesting was the androgeny palette. I thought the color story was cool but not enough to pay that much for it to support a genuinely bad person. I was also intrigued by the skin frost highlighter, but didn't buy it for the same reason. 


Other than those two, I find everything he puts out kind of tacky and bulky packaging wise. To each their own but I don't like super intricate or stylish packaging in general. I'd rather have something practical and compact because I am a boring ass bitch and I'm not ashamed of it."
5246,2020-08-17 23:48:18,ibg9v6,It’s an ugly palette. There’s nothing interesting about it.
5247,2020-08-18 00:19:50,ibg9v6,What sane person is hyping that palette up??? Tf.
5248,2020-08-18 00:20:24,ibg9v6,"None of his palettes are groundbreaking or revolutionary, and they're definitely not the best quality for what you pay (AUD tax whaddup). The fact he's acid in human form aside, his make up is mediocre with his fans hyping it and giving it the illusion of luxury."
5249,2020-08-18 00:42:04,ibg9v6,Oh yeah! They look like they should be worth $10 like nooo they look cheap and I hate the colours and can’t stand him!
5250,2020-08-18 03:04:46,ibg9v6,It looks like the 'choose your foundation shade' section of an online makeup retailer made into a palette... im sticking with colourpop's bare necessities
5251,2020-08-18 03:05:42,ibg9v6,"These last two palettes he released seemed so basic. There are cheaper brands that work just as well. 

Blue Blood is the only palette that actually looked great."
5252,2020-08-17 18:29:58,ibg9v6,"I’ve been lusting over the Biba palette but it’s so pricey! This one looks similar for cheaper. I don’t own a nude palette, but I want a good one. I’ve never purchased a Jeffree Star palette. I don’t know why people think he’s racist nor do I keep up with his antics. I’m strictly looking at this palette. Yes, it’s boring neutrals. I do need these shades and don’t want to spend $129 on Natasha Denona. Yeah, there’s some similar shades but this is still  around $60 and I just might get it if it doesn’t sell out in the first five minutes. No, I don’t want a Colourpop neutrals palette. Colourpop is just okay to me. I want the high-end stuff. I might wait to see what everyone says in their reviews before I buy."
5253,2020-08-17 18:48:13,ibg9v6,It definitely could have used some editing. So many shades are unnecessary.
5254,2020-08-17 21:59:32,ibg9v6,"He could've easily made that into a six pan palette and end up with the same look.   
It reads like an excuse to just release a bunch of raunchy shadows."
5255,2020-08-17 22:09:42,ibg9v6,"This Orgy palette has some very, how would you say, *strange* names. Honestly, I don't care if the theme is ""orgy"", just no. 

I never bothered to buy from his company because of how expensive the palettes are and stuff I can get cheaper with other brands that I prefer over his. Sorry, just not my cup of tea."
5256,2020-08-17 22:35:52,ibg9v6,"Fuck Jeffracial Slur. Seriously don’t buy anything from that shit stain of a person. Quality isn’t even that good, overpriced, and why support a racist when there are so many better brands out there"
5257,2020-08-17 22:54:18,ibg9v6,Every single Jeffree post lately just turns into arguments about him instead of the makeup itself. Nobody can have discussions anymore.
5258,2020-08-17 23:01:48,ibg9v6,"Okay so I've been wanting to have this convo for awhile.  
First, lemme take Jeffree as a person, and his entire being, and set that topic to the side for this. I wanna focus solely on his makeup brand.  


Moving on, everything eyeshadow related after the Bloodlust palette has been absolutely boring. Now I don't find any of the colors he releases ugly, because some of us like vibrancy, or a huge array of colors, and others like nudes. In every palette, he's tried to give something that pleases both parties, and I respected that.  
However, like I said, everything after Bloodlust has been utter trash and boring, and lowkey makes me like kinda angry, even though I didn't plan to buy anymore makeup.  


ANyways, these last two palettes have repeating colors. Like there's no doubt about it. You look at the top of the Orgy palette, like cmon dude. I don't care if there's difference in undertones of that line of shades, its still all the same and in the same row. A nude palette doesn't have to be so similar, and rarely are the favorite nude palettes ever doing that. Morphe popped off in the beginning for having beautiful nude palettes and they didn't look as samesy as Cremated or Orgy do. It's very shocking and disappointing to see a brand that continues to call other brands' releases ""boring and necessary"" when this is the shit they pull. UGH. I feel like I'm watching him decide to give up on innovation and settle for ""the brand name will sell the product."" I remember him even saying in a video (that's now probably years old) that he was working on releasing foundation soon. Again, that was probably years ago. Where's the soon? Idk man, it just seems so dumb to release these boring palettes, and not update on your innovation tactic. You still have the same shades of cream lipsticks after releasing them years ago and haven't updated it, you have concealers and face powders but refuse to work on making a foundation to complete it, and now you're deciding to switch focus towards a skincare line, again without even having a finished skin-makeup line. It makes no fucking sense to me, and I am so over it.  


PHEW. Sorry for the long post. I have like no friends who wear makeup or even care about this."
5259,2020-08-17 18:02:44,ibg9v6,"I used to be a fan of his makeup line but he's just been running it into the ground. The new orgy palette is not only tacky as fuck but super boring. He always shits on other brands like too faced for releasing ""boring"" makeup but then he literally just made a foundation palette into eyeshadow. His stans are blind and will always support him no matter what so I can guarantee that ugly palette will sell out."
5260,2020-08-17 20:23:24,ibg9v6,He’s such a shit person that who cares if his palettes are awesome? I don’t want to fund that fuck. He’s nasty.
5261,2020-08-17 20:26:37,ibg9v6,"I dont like it either. I used to support him before I learned about his past, I liked his makeup and campaigns and just... everything about his launches. This is the first one I actually dislike. 

The packaging, the names, the theme... it's too much for me. I dont think I'm a prude by any means, but I just dont understand why he made a marketing campaign around orgies. There are so many different things he could have named it. Skin Deep, Skinny Dip, In the Nude even. Just.... anything but sex acts. Hell if he was posing in a brightly colored speedo with more coverage  I would be more comfortable. Children are going to want that palette because they love the brand or Jeffree and they get to see his whole butt. Yeah I get that other brands have suggestive names like Orgasm, and Deepthroat (looking at you Nars) but this just feels different.

 The shades themselves are fine, if not my preference. They look chalky in the swatches plus half the palette is shades that will look ashy as hell on darker skin tones. I agree that he definitely puts in a similar white or 3 in most palettes. I use it as a base so I never complain about another white shadow. I do wish there were other shades put in more frequently that deeper toned people could use as a base. Most of these shades are something I could find anywhere else for less money. I dont need a $65 basic brown eyeshadow palette. Not to mention I just dont buy from the brand anymore."
5262,2020-08-17 23:13:05,ibg9v6,So I have the Mini Jawbreaker and the Conspiracy palette. I feel like the shadows are too pigmented. Which I would rather build up a shadow than have to tap my brush a million times and lightly go in. I don't have sensitive eyes but some of his shadows irritate the heck out of my eyes. His shadows do blend very well though and are vegan I believe. I feel like  the marketing was awful for this release. If the palette was a nude 12 shade palette it would sell out. Especially if he made a 12 shade nude palette for dark skin and another 12 shade nude palette for light skin. So that way he can show that makeup can be created and cater to everyone. Also the name of the palette so many people will not be able to get it.
5263,2020-08-17 19:06:21,ibg9v6,anything that comes from a racist is ugly imo
5264,2020-08-17 19:16:56,ibg9v6,"All of his dramas aside for a moment, the palette is so boring for his type of makeup. His brand strikes me as flashy instagram makeup, this is just too normal and everyday. Shades are repetitive and almost the same at times and too large imo for something with a color story that can be summed in 12 shades, max."
5265,2020-08-17 21:30:20,ibg9v6,I love the color story of the blue blood and cremated palettes but I know those haven't been popular so I understand why other brands haven't really jumped on those. I would never have been able to afford any of his makeup until about 2 years ago and now I can't support him in any way.
5266,2020-08-18 03:40:05,ibg9v6,Blood Sugar and Alien palette are my everything.  All recent palettes have been ... Eh.  Diminishing in quality and creativity.
5267,2020-08-18 20:15:08,ibg9v6,"You know what's funny? I have followed his launches, just because i like all kinds of make-up and i never bought anything, because on the daily basis i wear a lot of nudes, so his colourful palettes are preety, but i woudn't use them. So i thaught that maybe if some day he would do nudes i would re-consider. And then they all are matte, which is another thing i usually don't do. 

I know he mentioned something about mini palette having shimers, but i didn't get to that part."
5268,2020-08-25 19:09:42,ibg9v6,"I'm not really into him as a person lately but when I was I bought some things from his brand for him as a person and honestly I still buy his lipsticks and eyeshadows pallettes cuz I was always very happy with the quality, never had any allergic reaction from using them (huge issue of mine, there is huge amount of cosmetic I cannot use because of this) and enjoy his color story mostly. But also for me there are palettes which didn't interest me at all for example blue blood, blood lust etc. I also enjoy his face powders but that's it for me. I ordered orgy one couple days ago and I'm really looking forward to it. I like these kinds of palettes you can use in every situation if it's quick no make make up, normal simple everyday make-up or evening makeup."
5269,2020-08-17 20:33:34,ibg9v6,"I agree, it is ugly. I prefer Huda’s nude mini palettes because she made a mini palette suited for everyone’s skin tone. The orgy palette is too big and I just don’t see myself using all those colors based on my skin tone. I think this palette is more for professional makeup artists, not the average person"
5270,2020-08-17 20:27:56,ibg9v6,I have the Blue Blood & the Jawbreaker. With BB I can confirm your idea- the shades somehow repeat themselves. Thats why I passend on his last ones🤷🏻‍♀️
5271,2020-08-17 18:27:29,ibg9v6,Gross he has a palette named orgy. That’s disgusting.
5272,2020-08-17 19:09:44,ibg9v6,"His palettes got me into makeup, and I've bought every one since Jawbreaker. Something about them just really inspires me--even Cremated, which seemed so bland at first look, blends really well with some of his other palettes. I don't know, if you don't like it, you don't like it. Personally, I'm always happy when a new one comes out!"
5273,2020-08-17 20:53:26,ibg9v6,"as someone who buys his makeup second hand (so none of my money goes to him lol) i feel like orgy just isn’t for me. i find that the palettes i do own of his are mostly the bright ones with the exception of cremated, and i don’t wear nudes very often, and from the brief glance i gave the shades in his new palette they do pretty much look all the same. with that being said, i’ll absolutely be scouting depop for the mini palette which looks a bit more exciting"
5274,2020-08-17 17:23:27,ibg9v6,What’s ugly about his makeup lol it’s just colors
5275,2020-08-17 20:31:49,ibg9v6,"I like a lot of his products but I don't like him as a person anymore. I never called myself a stan though. 

As for his makeup, I have quite a bit of the liquid lipsticks and Blood Sugar, Blue Blood, Thirsty, jawbreaker, alien, and mini controversy. The palettes I've tried were blue blood, thirsty, and alien. I really like blue blood, thirsty no complaints so far, I find alien kind of an alright palette. The liquid lipsticks, depending on what you get and how they look on your skin tone, can be very pretty. The formula I don't find that bad. 

As for the orgy collection, the palette is so simple but I regularly use simple so it calls to me haha. Some glosses I am interested in trying though."
5276,2020-08-17 17:10:15,ibg9v6,"It may not be your cup of tea, but I don’t understand how you could say they are “ugly.” That just seems like a childish way of describing what are basically neutral palettes."
5277,2020-08-17 18:55:02,ibg9v6,You know it’s weird you say they make your eyes water because I have that issue with some of his shades too. Then I got the conspiracy palette and on the back there is a warning that some of the shades should not be used around immediate eye area.
5278,2020-08-17 15:35:02,ibg9v6,"I did think those two were cool, my confusion with the brand is palettes like conspiracy and jawbreaker, they both hurt my eyes to look at but if the quality is good and people like it then props to him!"
5279,2020-08-17 17:58:16,ibg9v6,I mean his stans always buy the whole collection even if the barely use any makeup so...
5280,2020-08-18 02:30:08,ibg9v6,"I know there could be malice behind this, but I actually liked this idea. The big palette doesn't appeal to me at all. I'd only want shimmers. It's nice to choose.

I know most palettes have a mixture which is a better buy, but I don't mind when brands don't do that either. I was a fan of the Fenty palettes that were all shimmers, for example."
5281,2020-08-17 17:12:38,ibg9v6,He still has stans and the last thing I want to do is piss off some little kid and be arguing and Jeffree Star all day
5282,2020-08-17 17:13:16,ibg9v6,"I echo the garbage human being. Even if he made the hottest palette and sold it for $1.99, he's not getting one red cent of my money."
5283,2020-08-17 17:12:32,ibg9v6,Yawn.
5284,2020-08-17 17:39:25,ibg9v6,Did you check out the ColourPop Nude Essentials palette ?
5285,2020-08-17 16:52:40,ibg9v6,That’s how I felt about the cremated palette.
5286,2020-08-17 18:48:50,ibg9v6,Profusion velvet mattes :)
5287,2020-08-17 17:25:58,ibg9v6,"I don’t understand either, I struggle with a lot of the colors in his palettes but specifically this one confused me"
5288,2020-08-17 21:01:47,ibg9v6,He made this palette to copy morphe since they just dropped him
5289,2020-08-17 19:32:50,ibg9v6,The swatches also look like literal chalk to me
5290,2020-08-17 15:34:07,ibg9v6,"I wasn’t a fan of the cremated palette but I’m also not into Smokey looks🤷🏼‍♀️I feel like the thirsty palette and blood sugar palettes were ok, his color choices usually confuse me 😂"
5291,2020-08-18 02:33:07,ibg9v6,"I just don't understand this palette after the creamated palette.

He shouldn't have released creamated at all and just took the financial hit. His brand didnt have a nude palette before creamated, so the fans might have liked a nude, despite what everyone else says.

But since he's already released creamated, and after all the bullshit over the name...now he releases ""orgy"". Meh. 

It's kinda boring. Who wants nudes?"
5292,2020-08-17 17:12:03,ibg9v6,"I liked his humor before all the controversy, what I don’t like is how rude and overall childish he is there for I do not support him as a creator I was simply asking if anyone else thought is palettes were nothing to run home about 🤷🏼‍♀️"
5293,2020-08-17 17:11:11,ibg9v6,OP doesn’t owe you any explanation or justification.
5294,2020-08-17 16:50:12,ibg9v6,idk if they actually said they liked him
5295,2020-08-18 09:11:18,ibg9v6,"more like the jouer/viseart neutral palette, but bigger and with so many unnecessary shades. I don't get his obsession with having 50+ shades in in one palette. 20-25 shades is more than enough and won't force his fans to spend so. much. money. he exploits them and tries to suck every penny he can from them. it's just... sad. he has so much money and is more them comfortable and secure, why being so monry hungry? it disgusts me."
5296,2020-08-17 17:58:36,ibg9v6,I agree I think had it been a smaller palette it would’ve been a very good shade selection. For me it was way to many of the same looking color I didn’t see many different looks coming from the palette.
5297,2020-08-18 01:46:37,ibg9v6,"I have Alien and it’s awesome, but I don’t know how to store it. You can’t stack anything on top because of the protruding eyes. I just kind of have it off to the side."
5298,2020-08-17 18:27:51,ibg9v6,I agree! I like the packaging of his products and the quality seems to be good from what I hear (:
5299,2020-08-17 23:14:13,ibg9v6,"If you want a high end neutrals palette, there’s other places to look. You’re not stuck choosing between just Natasha denona, jeffree Star, and colourpop. There’s tons of good brands out there. Plus this palette is all mattes, and Biba isn’t. I also don’t see how anyone who isn’t a professional makeup artist would need so many strictly matte shades, but I’m not to judge you on your makeup preferences. 

I’d say you’re better off getting a neutrals palette with beautiful shimmers in it as well. Sephora’s in house brand has a large neutrals palette for around $60 that’s just gorgeous and has plenty of good reviews online. NARS does great neutrals as well, as does ABH."
5300,2020-08-17 23:19:55,ibg9v6,[deleted]
5301,2020-08-18 01:37:45,ibg9v6,There was a band named Orgy. I used to love them. It was awkward to tell people about them and have to say their name.
5302,2020-08-17 17:24:36,ibg9v6,What isn’t ugly is the better question? Conspiracy and jawbreaker seem like they were thrown together with literally no effort whatsoever. Remind me why I want to raid my bank account for ugly shades when many other brands have better palettes with no controversy??
5303,2020-08-17 17:58:32,ibg9v6,Colours =/= pretty lol
5304,2020-08-17 17:15:57,ibg9v6,"I personally think the shades are ugly in most of his palettes. Do you know what neutral colors are?? Blood sugar, his blue palette, conspiracy, jaw breaker and plenty more are no where near neutral? Unless you’re color blind? I think what’s more childish is not doing research before a comment that seems pretty immature to me 🤷🏼‍♀️"
5305,2020-08-17 17:54:18,ibg9v6,"It’s her OPINION.  And you understand that neutral can mean many things to different shades of people.  I prefer medium browns because they’re neutral to me and lighter shades, I can care less for because they look ashy on me so I would tend to think those colors are ugly.  As in, my opinion."
5306,2020-08-17 21:31:03,ibg9v6,Ya I think it’s likely the “pressed pigments” (I think that’s the right name for them..) and believe I would likely have the same issue with the newer Norvina palettes too which has held me back from picking one up to try.
5307,2020-08-17 17:53:39,ibg9v6,"I don't support him anymore, but I do own the Jawbreaker palette and the quality really is top of the game (except a few shades). I pretty much only do colorful and over the top looks, so the palette is a nice addition to my collection. It's also my most panned palette so I think that it really is marketed towards a very specific group of people."
5308,2020-08-17 17:19:49,ibg9v6,This is weird because most fans of Jeffree are adults and it’s actually more kids that don’t like him in my experience.
5309,2020-08-17 17:24:03,ibg9v6,"Making the hottest pallette and selling it for that cheap will add to his garbage persona, imagine how little he'll be paying his workers in that scenario."
5310,2020-08-17 17:26:56,ibg9v6,Is racism boring to you or what?
5311,2020-08-17 17:29:29,ibg9v6,"We get it, you're boring. Cute."
5312,2020-08-17 18:13:56,ibg9v6,Yes!!! I want the bare necessities palette. But I forgot how colourpop is- does it work well with a brush? I have long nails and cannot apply makeup with my finger so any palette that’s like stronger with a finger application annoys me. But if it works good with brushes I will buy!
5313,2020-08-17 18:01:03,ibg9v6,"I have seen that palette! I like the color selection Because I see the difference in the shades. You see the darker shades as well as some more orange tones, shimmers and a ton of basic base shades."
5314,2020-08-18 02:13:38,ibg9v6,I love their stuff!
5315,2020-08-18 01:54:51,ibg9v6,"I definitely think he took a leaf out of the Morphe handbook, but they dropped him pretty recently and he would have been working on the palette for a long time before this.

Almost shocked he hasn’t used this opportunity to shade them and their formula, though."
5316,2020-08-17 20:17:03,ibg9v6,Lmfao dupes can be found at walmart in the crayola section
5317,2020-08-17 15:35:23,ibg9v6,Lmao i feel you! I bought a palette that had warm colors then he threw in a blue/green and I was like wtf? Lmao
5318,2020-08-18 03:16:36,ibg9v6,It looks like a nice palette but you can get a nude palette anywhere. Why spend mad money for a palette that can be cheaper!
5319,2020-08-17 17:13:42,ibg9v6,"I gotcha. I definitely liked him before finding out he's racist and whatnot. And I totally agree, the last couple palettes are super uninteresting."
5320,2020-08-17 17:12:32,ibg9v6,"I mean, you're right. But I'm just asking a question."
5321,2020-08-17 16:51:00,ibg9v6,The last sentence of the post...
5322,2020-08-17 23:34:50,ibg9v6,"I have food allergies so I am limited in what brands I can purchase from. So there are only a few high-end options for me. I can’t do ABH, Nars, Fenty, Tarte, and a bunch more. So while there may be options I don’t know about yet, these are my two options unless I want to go with a more drugstore feel: Revolution Beauty, Elf, Colourpop, etc. I really want something more high-end for this purchase, which is why I’m considering Jeffree Star. His brand has zero allergens. I don’t need ALL those shades. I need the Biba palette to be $60 😂"
5323,2020-08-17 23:22:00,ibg9v6,What did he do!? 😮
5324,2020-08-18 01:39:06,ibg9v6,Jawbreaker seemed really cool though. Those colors are fantastic. And the formula is supposed to be pretty good.
5325,2020-08-17 17:27:54,ibg9v6,"Again it’s just colors. I for one like the colors. I wouldn’t buy jawbreaker or blood sugar because I don’t wear such vibrant colors. It sounds more like you don’t like the controversy rather than finding the shades ugly with how often you’re bringing up his controversy instead of criticizing his actual product. 

Also his products I’ve found to be a good quality, vegan free, and cruelty which many consumers find important to themselves."
5326,2020-08-17 19:41:06,ibg9v6,"I just couldn’t see how neon blue,green, pink, bright reds and purples are neutrals? I associate neutrals with any brown,light orange, beige type of shades as well as your classic “everyday looks”"
5327,2020-08-18 00:47:07,ibg9v6,Yeah it is the presses pigments. The first time I saw that I was like oh no wonder my eye was stained bright pink for two days.
5328,2020-08-17 17:57:52,ibg9v6,I would have to agree with that I think it’s marketed towards a specific group. I’m glad the quality is good and works for people!
5329,2020-08-17 17:23:41,ibg9v6,Either way I don’t want to argue with anyone who can’t see Jeffree for what he really is. I simply wanted to comment on the awful color selection in some of his palettes
5330,2020-08-18 01:53:03,ibg9v6,Happy cake day
5331,2020-08-17 18:16:11,ibg9v6,"Depends on what formula is in the palette and most of them are that “dry” stuff which can be used with a brush (especially since they came out with there own brush line).  I  know, from personal experience, if it’s the super shock formula, it’ll work with a brush BUT it’s better with a finger since the body heat “melts” it."
5332,2020-08-17 17:18:04,ibg9v6,It’s literally a forum.. people can ask any questions they want I thought?
5333,2020-08-18 01:38:58,ibg9v6,"Wow I wasn't even considering allergies in this, I'm sorry for the assumption. Hopefully Biba goes on a megasale. Follow r/MUAontheCheap if you don't already. Sometimes there are some crazy ND sales, but I'm sure you already know that Biba goes on sale less frequently than other palettes."
5334,2020-08-17 23:30:35,ibg9v6,[deleted]
5335,2020-08-17 17:31:01,ibg9v6,"You can like the colors, I never said anyone can’t like the colors. I personally find them unattractive and not worth the money. I bring up the controversy because imo many other unproblematic brands make similar palettes without being canceled like 10 times that are better? I made my own thread so I didn’t tear down anyone for liking his products or supporting him as a brand owner. I’m not sure why negative comments such as these are here when I didn’t say anything overly negative🤷🏼‍♀️"

5338,2020-08-17 17:25:34,ibg9v6,"Then why bad mouth people that like his stuff? Sounds kinda like you wanted to start an argument by saying “idk if they Stan Jeffree”

You don’t have to Stan Jeffree to like his products and don’t have to demean people for purchasing products they like. Period."
5339,2020-08-18 02:38:41,ibg9v6,Thanks!

5346,2020-08-17 18:52:18,ibg9v6,I don’t think this a train you wanna ride to the end...
5347,2020-08-17 17:28:01,ibg9v6,"I never bad mouthed people who like his stuff, I literally commented that if it works for people props to him. I never said you have to stan Jeffree to like his products do you think before you type? For the last time I literally said I PERSONALLY, literally my own opinion on my own thread, that I’m not a fan of the colors and don’t get the hype. You come out of nowhere with all this shut I didn’t say like what?"
5348,2020-08-17 20:21:51,ibg9v6,Yes I was planning on buying this one! It looks perfect!
5349,2020-08-17 17:21:43,ibg9v6,"Wow,I didn’t think my post was negative either? They commented calling me childish basically because they think Jeffree has mainly “neutral” palettes and at this point I’m confused if we’re all talking about the same Jeffree 😂"
5350,2020-08-17 17:47:31,ibg9v6,I didn’t realize liking someone is being obsessed with them.

5352,2020-08-17 18:53:12,ibg9v6,Already rode it. Confirmed OP is a teenager with an attitude problem and general idiocracy.
5353,2020-08-17 17:32:23,ibg9v6,">I’m not sure if the quality is why people rave or if they just Stan Jeffree

Implies fans of Jeffree are overzealous fans to be fans of him

>The last thing I want to do is piss off some little kid

Implies that people who like Jeffree are childish

>Who can’t see Jeffree for who he really is

Implies that fans of Jeffree haven’t done their own research, come to their own conclusions etc. 

>Are you colorblind? Do you know what neutrals are?

Just straight up mean because you read something wrong."
5354,2020-08-17 20:45:48,ibg9v6,I love it a lot! I had the naked 3 but when it ran out I went for this because it's way more versatile and has more colors.
5355,2020-08-17 17:23:32,ibg9v6,Jeffree stans are on another level these days
5356,2020-08-17 17:50:52,ibg9v6,"Liking someone isn't necessarily being obsessed with them. But I'm talking about how u/WestCoLouis is responding to every single comment that is even slightly criticizing him. Maybe not obsession, but definitely bizarre."
5357,2020-08-17 19:30:15,ibg9v6,I think you have the attitude problem here. But I suppose you have to like manufactured drama to be a Jeffree stan.
5358,2020-08-17 20:10:50,ibg9v6,"Y’all, go easy. I imagine it can’t be easy out here defending a racist, vile human being. 🙄"
5359,2020-08-17 18:53:27,ibg9v6,I hope you stretched before all this reaching.
5360,2020-08-17 17:35:38,ibg9v6,"Neither of the first two are negative wtf? I have never bought one of his palettes therefor obviously as one can assume I don’t know what the quality is. He’s literally proven to be problematic, search his palettes on google? None of them are neutrals again unless you’re color blind. Lmao you’re like big mad rn for no reason go kiss his ass somewhere else 💁🏼‍♀️because I, like a lot of the other people commenting, don’t find him or his makeup to be needed in the makeup community."
5361,2020-08-17 21:06:44,ibg9v6,"Yes! Does it work well with a brush, is the pigment strong? That was my only hesitation with it, I’ve used their foundation and love their mascara but haven’t used their eyeshadows."
5362,2020-08-17 18:01:26,ibg9v6,"I apologize, I may not have woken up completely.  I thought you were talking about OP because she didn’t seem “obsessed” with Star, but I do agree that it is bizarre that that person is in a lot of the comments stirring things up."
5363,2020-08-18 02:53:20,ibg9v6,"In a way I rather admire the bald faced arrogance to continue to further mire oneself in an obviously lost argument. But also at the same time, damn she shoulda just let it go LOL"
5364,2020-08-17 20:11:27,ibg9v6,"Oh look someone else who needs to grow up jesus 

If you can’t comprehend what’s being said then don’t comment."
5365,2020-08-17 17:37:53,ibg9v6,">go kiss his ass somewhere else 

Again implying that fans of Jeffree are overzealous. 

You’re obviously a child so I’m ending this conversation. Maybe one day you’ll grow up. 

Also it’s not my fault you didn’t understand what the other commentor meant by neutral."
5366,2020-08-17 21:16:39,ibg9v6,"Yes, very pigmented expect fallout.

The glitter shades show up best with a finger application IMO, but I haven't tried it with a wet brush. You will still see some if it's bright out. Otherwise I don't see it using a dry brush application. Thinking about it, it may still show up okay if the glitter is layered on too vs applied with no shadow underneath. Otherwise it looks kinda matte. This is going off memory, but I can swatch it in a bit and tell you for sure. (hardly any makeup during COVID so I usually go bright when I do wear it, especially for summer lol)

Matte shades all apply fine with a brush, besides the fallout. I expect that with pigmented shadows though.

Out of all the shades the only one I have a real complaint about is the whitest glitter shade, it shows up  only by finger application for sure and I still don't see it well when applying that way. It doesn't bother me too much though because I can just use white highlight instead.

Also this is the only eyeshadow I've used from them and was pleasantly surprised after looking a long time for a nude palette to replace the Naked 3."
5367,2020-08-18 16:08:22,ibg9v6,"I’m assuming she’s just out of her teen years and thinks teens are so babyish, based on her comments lol

Edit: not assuming OP is a teen, this user just seems very sure she is"
5368,2020-08-17 20:23:13,ibg9v6,"No please, what point am I missing?"
5369,2020-08-17 19:34:48,ibg9v6,"You're calling OP a child? I'm guessing you're like 19 or 20 and trying to act like those couple extra years has afforded you all the wisdom in the universe.

I'm in my 30s and I dislike J* and his products, and I'm old enough that I followed him on MySpace"
5370,2020-08-17 17:40:31,ibg9v6,"I’m actually not, I’m a full grown adult, maybe one day you’ll stop arguing with people who’s beliefs don’t completely align with yours, that’s pathetic, problematic and a waste of time. Maybe you’ll realize that, have a good day 😄"
5371,2020-08-17 22:22:59,ibg9v6,"Sounds good! I just have a problem sometimes applying with finger because my nails are long, I know people on videos do it but I can’t! Lol, I also don’t like doing it because my hands get dirty and I’m usually trying to get out the door fast."
5372,2020-08-17 20:24:20,ibg9v6,I’m not even commenting on his controversy. I’m giving OP shit for low key trash talking people that buy his products. That’s what my examples were for. I have t said jack on my thoughts on his controversy
5373,2020-08-17 19:38:31,ibg9v6,Ok and? I’m not saying to not like Jeffree for whatever reason you want. That’s your choice. OP is still a child who can’t seem to take responsibility for his or her  own words.

5375,2020-08-17 18:19:10,ibg9v6,"Except I’m not arguing with you for not liking Jeffree lol idc what you like but don’t sit here and demean people who buy his products then throw a fit like a child when called out

Also it’s pathetic you’re incapable of understanding basic English language and are interpreting it so poorly you’re starting nonexistent arguments."
5376,2020-08-26 15:45:26,ibg9v6,"I am sorry this took so long but [here](https://imgur.com/a/A4qCmiQ) is the swatch.

For the matte shades I added glitter on top to help kind of see what I mean. 

I applied all shades with a brush only.

Match up one for glitter shade, so starting at bottom (there is a blank spot because I skipped Swan and Snow since it doesn't really show up on me):

Truffle Sable

Chestnut Cocoa

Maple Light

Rum Warm Rose

Petal Rose Gold

Sand Nude

Petal Seashell


I don't usually swatch so if you are still deciding I hope this helps!

Labeled picture is in bright sun, unlabeled is daylight without direct sun."
5377,2020-08-17 20:29:55,ibg9v6,And why would anyone be upset or “trash” someone for buying his products?
5378,2020-08-17 19:32:40,ibg9v6,"I’m not acting like I have all the wisdom in the universe,and no I’m older actually. How does this have anything to do with the palette discussion?"
5379,2020-08-17 18:25:41,ibg9v6,"I wasn’t called out, you got your panties in a twist and made pathetic comments about my posts.. and still are making pathetic comments on my posts..
My advice? Get a life maybe?"
5380,2020-08-26 15:49:48,ibg9v6,Looks beautiful that you for doing this.
5381,2020-08-17 20:34:25,ibg9v6,"Does it matter? Why judge someone for buying shit they like? 

If it bothers someone that much they need to fuck off and mind their own life"
5382,2020-08-17 18:27:20,ibg9v6,Yikes you need to seriously re-evaluate your own life before trying to dictate someone else’s. Now kindly fuck off with your bullshit.
5383,2020-08-26 16:05:26,ibg9v6,No problem! I just feel bad it took a week lol
5384,2020-08-17 20:44:03,ibg9v6,"Who is it really bothering so much? I mean, I typically consider curse words and phrases like “fuck off” an indication of irritation or anger. 

And yes, I think it does matter. But you are also free to buy what you like; yet, doesn’t mean people aren’t going to be critical of that choice or of those products when the brand owner (who also is basically the brand) is continually problematic."
5385,2020-08-17 18:28:58,ibg9v6,Or you could just go somewhere else if you want to kiss someone’s ass.? Maybe you’re the one who needs to fuck off with your problematic self. Literally no one wants you on the forum

5424,2020-08-15 16:29:06,ia6pyx,"my thoughts are that we should stop giving this racist edgelord a platform. 

the palette is just as nonsensical as the cremated palette. a bland color story with way too many repeat shades."
5425,2020-08-15 14:20:25,ia6pyx,"The cover of it gives me the creeps, and the color story is just so repetitive that most of the colors on the eye, won’t look even a tiny bit different. Huge pass"
5426,2020-08-15 13:11:13,ia6pyx,"The name doesn't phase me, everything that J* does is for shock value and how long it will keep his name in people's mouths. The pallet color story is a snoozefest."
5427,2020-08-16 19:24:31,ia6pyx,"Seems boring, it's like all his pallettes bulky and in this case not even pretty. I hate the trend that Company owners put their photo on packaging. For me it looks cheap and it feels like you don't really ""own"" the product (nobody would want Steve jobs/tim cook on their iPhone). I personally have nothing against nude artwork on makeup, like the balm eyeshadows, but in this case it's the Brand owner and feels wrong. Also 30 matte Tones, so you have to use a Companion pallette for shimmers. Sure there are other ""just matte"" natural eyeshadow out there, but it's rarely more than 12 shades, because as you can see in this pallete :there are dupes for one another in the same pallette. The Names are shit, it's not neccasary sex-positive, but porn-positive and there is so much shit going on in porn from profiting of child rape that was uploaded and refusing to remove it even if the victim contact them to refusing paypent etc (hot girls wanted is a good documentary on it). Also he has young fans meaning 12-18,and honestly ""fluffer"", ""glory hole"" and ""money shot"" is not something I would want a teenage girl to Google and implement in her view of sex. The Mini on the other hand looks honestly so much better colorwise and even the Names are more  walking the line than beeing totally in your face. He could have easily removed some repeat shades and added shimmer to make the Main pallette more usable."

5429,2020-08-15 14:16:33,ia6pyx,Im actually looking forward to it. Looks like a good range of naturals but a bit sad to see that the main palette doesn’t contain glitters and shimmery colors
5430,2020-08-15 18:01:46,ia6pyx,"it reminds me a lot of the beauty bay nude 42 pan palette. 
i think it i would like it better either as two palettes, like a 9 pan matte and a 9 pan shimmer or combine those two for an 18 shade palette ? 
idk about most people, but i know i’m so over giant palettes. chances are i have all the shades anyways. for me personally it’s better to have smaller palettes with a more inspiring colour story, even for neutral palettes"
5431,2020-08-15 16:46:31,ia6pyx,"Color story is boring to me, but I could see it being a good palette for a makeup artist who just wants a ton of matte skin tone shades all in 1 place instead of having to use a bunch of different palettes. The shade names and overall theme are kind of disgusting though."
5432,2020-08-15 14:23:19,ia6ozs,"Let's ignore the fact that Jeffree is a shitty person and that no one should in good consciousness support him or his makeup brand and just speak on the palette. First, who would even want a palette with mini naked Jstars on it? Like wtf? I feel like my eyes were bleeding after seeing that. Second, I think the names are pretty gross. Honestly, sexual naming is not really to my tastes, and things like orgasm or deep throat from NARS was already a little much for me, but this palette makes it look tame in comparison. I can't imagine someone using this palette and then when asked going yeah I have glory hole and cunnilingus on my eyes! Like?? It's just so tacky and in such bad taste imo. Thirdly, the shade name craving chocolate is gross (i thought it literally meant chocolate, but it was brought to my attention that this name is actually fetishizing poc and i was shocked that he would include something like this), while Jstar is already under fire for being a racist - at this point I'm just wondering if he does this on purpose. And lastly, in terms of the actual color story, I find some of the browns to be nice, but many of the colors are way too similar and will look pretty much exactly the same on the eyes and is completely unnecessary for the average consumer, especially with all those different shades of white/cream. 

There's just so many neutral palettes out there I don't understand why anyone would want this one. I'm not sure what kind of audience he is catering to honestly."
5433,2020-08-15 18:19:21,ia6ozs,"I am very sex positive and I am that friend which talks about sex a lot. But the palette name and the fact that it's nudes (let's pretend that we are in a world where we can just judge this ""maginificent, iconic, never done before palette"" by itself) is just... boring and bland. Orgy. Ok, I can dig the name but the shade names are just an eye roll. It's not controversial or interesting, just like saying penis was controversial as what a high school kid? I dunno. 

Ok, I'm in Europe so I can't buy colorpop and it would cost me a good J\* palette. But why would I need such a boring palette with awful packaging and the name just being a sleeper? 

If he really wanted controversial he could've dug out some more controversial things and I side eye the genderfluid... Why is it sexual? What's sexy about a gender? 

Also... we get it, you joke about pussy a lot, haha, but seriously cut the genitalia crap. It's getting cringy. 

Anyway, it's boring all around and has no message, no story to tell and is just plain awful with him as the main dish."
5434,2020-08-15 13:36:53,ia6ozs,"I don’t like Jeffree as a person, but I don’t find the name or the theme of the palette disturbing. I’m not the type of person to be bothered by sex related references, although I understand why some people are bothered. 

I think Jeffree’s recent palettes have been too big and overwhelming. I think it’s smart of the brand to finally have neutral palettes, but a lot of the shades in Orgy are going to look similar on the eye, which is an issue with the Cremated palette too. I’m more attracted to the mini Orgy palette and Jeffree’s other mini palettes."
5435,2020-08-15 20:03:18,ia6ozs,"i already have a strong dislike of j* and has never and will never purchase his makeup on principle alone. that aside, i think the palette is boring. i just find nude neutrals to be really underwhelming and boring and i don’t need a whole 30 shade palette dedicated to it especially since i still have my old ass naked 1. plus, when i think “orgy” for some reason, nudes and neutrals really dont come to mind. 

i don’t normally care about sex-themed names if it’s on one of two shades/products (i mean stuff like the orgasm and deep throat blushes and the better than sex mascara) but having a whole palette with sex-themed shade names is just... a bit much. i also feel like the packaging is just... yeah. it really turned me off seeing a naked j* on my instagram feed at 12:30 in the afternoon. 

don’t get me wrong, im generally pretty sex positive and like i said, i dont normally find sex-themed product names to be offensive but i feel this is just over the top."
5436,2020-08-15 13:20:38,ia6ozs,"The names of the shades are gross as well as the cover of the palette. I never have wanted a porn themed palette and I never will. The names of the shades reminds me of the tacky lipstick shades names that Nikita Dragun has like 'Whorechata'. Plus it's all matte with no variations of shimmer (hard to get a cohesive look and will have to use another palette to complete your look), about 15 shades will appear similar on the eyelids. So it's definitely not worth the money at all and definitely won't buy it."
5437,2020-08-16 00:29:59,ia6ozs,"j* as a person is shit and that’s not something I would set aside for even a second. On top of that, the palette names are awful and disgusting, the top comment on here summed it up better but they’re honestly just tacky and gross. It’s also especially gross since he’s a big name who can easily get young and impressionable viewers who stumble onto his content, and having palettes with names like that is just extra bad"
5438,2020-08-16 04:42:59,ia6ozs,"am i the only one who sees a stark difference between something like nars orgasm and this? orgasm isn’t in your face like cunnilingus, glory hole, craving chocolate, blow out, etc. like there’s a degree to where it goes from tongue in cheek to trashy. that’s obviously just my opinion, i don’t think of myself as sex-negative or anything but i’d rather not have cunnilingus in my crease. also the palette is boring and j* is a pos."
5439,2020-08-15 18:46:03,ia6ozs,"This palette is really underwhelming. I'm ashamed to admit that I lowkey secretly kind of want the cremated palette, I absolutely will not get it, but Orgy is just boring af. It looks like a Beautybay palette, but Beautybay's nude palettes looks much better. Tarte has some nice nude palettes.

There is literally no part of me that has any interest in this palette, not even for a split second have the thought even crossed my mind that it's a nice palette.

I also feel a bit victimized by the palette cover."
5440,2020-08-15 18:52:18,ia6ozs,"Without considering j* as a person, the palette looks like any nude morphe palette, too big and full of shades that will look the same on the eye. I dont think anyone will ever use 30 shades of nude shadow, it not worth it to buy imo"
5441,2020-08-15 20:36:02,ia6ozs,"Putting aside my issues with him as a person, I feel like the “scandalous” naming of the palette is supposed to make me overlook how absolutely boring a palette it is. 30 matte neutral shades is pretty much the dullest thing I can think of, and there’s no way I’d pay $60+ for that. His bare butt being on it isn’t going to suddenly make me think it’s wild and fun.

Taking into account my dislike of him, this feels like trolling. Before I could understand the desire to purchase from him because there really weren’t any blue or red palettes out there like his, so I could understand fans being in denial of his behavior from simply wanting the palette that badly. But by putting out a palette this basic while still being expensive, it almost comes off as “I can do anything and my fan will still jump on my releases.”"
5442,2020-08-15 21:43:48,ia6ozs,I'm not a makeup artist so I only do makeup on myself; I don't personally need all of those tones and I dont really wear neutrals
5443,2020-08-15 18:25:23,ia6ozs,"i like that he shoed range of skin tone in mirrors but if he's gonna have the palest and highly melanated then I think he should have something between as well, also none of his concealers or powers are good for my skin and the eyeshadow palette looks boring"

5448,2020-08-15 22:30:00,ia6ozs,"I agree that this palette needs a little more range in colors, but cremated, although some colors look strikingly similar, on my eyes at least, they appear completely different, also a lot of them wear darker than the look of the shade in the pan. I wonder if this palette would be the same in that respect."

Orgasm, cunnilingus even deepthroat all seem kind of ""normal"" for sex that is enjoyed by both Parties. ""glory hole"" for me often has the Taste of porn where the women is crying during it and some psycho wanks to this shit. He has young Fans and I honestly would have much less problems talking with my hypothetical teenage daughter about oral Sex than ""whats a glory hole"""

makeup geek also has good quality affordable single shadows."
5458,2020-08-15 02:22:41,i9zd3l,"Lol, thought I was reading the jerk for a second. Just build your own palette. Do some research if colourpop is available in Canada. Whether it is or isn’t, there are plenty of brands that sell single shadows. Just search the sub."
5459,2020-08-15 06:59:35,i9zd3l,"I have light skin with cool undertones.
It was quite a challenge to find a palette suitable for light AND cool skin (most palettes that are considered cool are just cooler than the majority of releases, butnot ""really"" cool).

Have you had a look at the Huda nude obsession in light? They made this palette in three versions for different skintones. It doesn't work for me because it is not cool enough, but might work for you.
Another option might be the Dior Backstage warm neutrals palette.

You might want to visit r/palemua"
5460,2020-08-15 07:00:44,i9zd3l,"Maybe the #dear Nude palette from 3CE. Although I’m not sure what your definition of pale shades is; you might want to look into highlighter palettes as well. Haven’t tried any of 3CE’s stuff so I can’t vouch for the formula though. I actually like the gothy dark eyeshadow and pale skin look, but I can understand wanting a more subtle look as well."

5463,2020-08-15 03:55:48,i9zd3l,"idk what the jerk is and i just made this account to join this subreddit to ask for advice :( I’m sorry if my post seemed mean or anything to you. I waited to respond to your reply bc it seemed mean to me and I was upset, but maybe I’m just overthinking everything. I can’t make a Colourpop palette bc they’re sold out of every pale shade and I just wanted advice to see if anyone knew of any pale palettes or other alternatives. Single shadows are more expensive to buy individually, that’s why I wanted a palette. Is “just search the sub” a common response here? I’m sorry :("
5464,2020-08-15 07:26:33,i9zd3l,"Thank you! And ya, I’ve noticed that most of the palettes out there tend to be quite warm. The Huda palette in 3 different versions is exactly what I was talking about! I just feel so wasteful throwing out 75% of a palette after using up 25% of it, and I think more companies should do that, so that people will know that they can comfortably use every colour and won’t be wasting product. This is super helpful, thank you!"
5465,2020-08-15 07:30:25,i9zd3l,"oh yes, that might work! It still looks 40-50% too dark to me, but at least that would be less wasted product than most other palettes. And ya I definitely dress more gothy myself, but I just don’t have the face for dark eyeshadow; I end up looking more bulldog-ish than gothy"
5466,2020-08-15 07:40:55,i9zd3l,"Yes, it is incredible wasteful.
That's why i customized my own palette - it's just much more sustainable ecologically and economically."
5467,2020-08-15 07:58:09,i9zd3l,"Yeah, I’m not sure what’s up with ColourPop and their out-of-stock stuff :/ what do you mean that you don’t have the face for dark eyeshadows? I’m also pale and have epicanthic folds and my eyes are so hooded they’re monolids, and I think the contrast looks cool :’o is it the eyebags? cuz I don’t have those

Also you can still use the palette I mentioned maybe; I’ve heard 3CE isn’t as pigmented anyway so it could be nice for a sheer look."
5468,2020-08-15 08:57:55,i9zd3l,"Can I ask what brands let you do that? I don’t mean to sound dumb or like I can’t google for myself or be a bother or anything. It’s just that before I saw it on the Colourpop website, I didn’t know this was a thing, and Colourpop just doesn’t have any more pale shades :( I then tried a few different brands and none of them seemed to offer to let you do this"
5469,2020-08-15 08:19:29,i9zd3l,"ya it’s definitely the eyebags lmao. I only ever put dark eyeshadow in my inner corners, which means I almost never actually go through a dark eyeshadow. If I put the dark shadow all over it just makes my eyes looks really small and mean, and also highlights how the roundness of my upper eyelid connects through the epicanthic fold to my eyebag, making my eyes look like little mean circles (if that even makes sense lmao)"
5470,2020-08-15 11:53:17,i9zd3l,"At first I tried MAC but had a similar experience to you: a lot of the shades I wanted were out of stock.
I ended up building my dream palette at ArtDeco - however, I don't know whether they are available international, it is a German brand."
5471,2020-08-15 08:43:02,i9zd3l,"ahh I see! for the record I wasn’t trying to make you feel bad or trying to act superior when I said I didn’t have eyebags. you shouldn’t feel bad about your natural eye shape! >U< I just looked at mine and i don’t even know what I’d call the bottom part; there’s like some weird skin on the lower part too but it doesn’t look like what you get if you Google search “aegyo sal” or “eyebags”. so basically kinda like the ""before"" picture here (but with monolids): https://www.stylekorean.com/data/editor/1607/3af7b7107a9d9a819074e83c16872bb7_1469785220_5121.jpg

oh yeah, not sure if you know about this, but the eyebags thing is kind of popular in South Korea from what I know? not sure if it's still in style but it's called ""aegyo sal""; maybe some makeup for that could be helpful? the image I just linked above is supposed to be an aegyo sal look, where they intentionally draw on eyebags on the bottom.

do you think you could put the dark eyeshadow on your brows instead or use it as eyeliner? :3 im picky about colors, so I can kinda get what you mean.

also maybe check out r/hoodedeyes?"
5472,2020-08-15 08:53:49,i9zd3l,"It’s okay, I wasn’t feeling bad or anything haha !And that’s a nice eye shape! I sometimes wish I had under eyes like that, but I’ve made peace with my crevices lmao (they’re straight-up indents in my face, no amount of concealer will ever cover them). They don’t bother me actually, but I do think they’re why my eyeshadow choices feel so limited. I actually like putting concealer over my nose bridge and then a pale eyeshadow on my lid and a little tiny bit of dark shadow in the inner corners. It kind of makes my face look more put-together I think.

And I wish I could use it on my eyebrows ! Alas they’re thick and black, so basically only eyebrow pencils work

And thanks for the suggestion! I’ll definitely check that subreddit out"
5473,2020-08-15 09:14:14,i9zd3l,"thanks! although my actual eyes have monolids so the top is different from that “before” photo :) I do think it’s good to make peace with this, and I think the pale eyeshadow sounds really nice with darker shades in the inner corners. what do you think about using highlighter shades on the eyelid, or are those too shimmery for you?"
5474,2020-08-15 09:29:43,i9zd3l,I like shimmers! Anything that kind of brightens up the area works for me

Additionally, if we were outspoken enough, bigger corporations like L’Oréal and Maybelline would listen. After all, let’s take a look at their newest releases. Their market research teams are clearly great at spotting the increasing demand for cream cheek products, non-sticky glosses and dewy base products. As long as there is a demand for products made by systematically racist companies, as long as their shelves get cleared during sales, they will continue to go on they way they are operating now. It is very sad and disheartening to see as a life-long ally. I think in the words of Samantha Ravendahl, there is no such thing as an ethical corporation the best we can do is reduce our consumption, make educated decisions and try to support smaller businesses."
5485,2020-08-15 00:31:56,i9wqxt,"These 'drugstore' brands also benefit from having a *massive* consumer base that doesn't use the Internet and social media like we do. So many of their consumers wouldn't know, or even care, about issues we feel are important and discuss on a regular basis. There is money in meeting the 'standards' that social media asks of these companies, but it's a *segment* of their brands.

You can see this with these major cosmetic companies They own brands that are marketed to different consumers. But they're all owned by the same people. If they want to make a 100% vegan, cruelty free product they'll launch it in one brand, while also still use animal products and testing on another brand.

If they want to build awareness for POC consumers, they'll launch with one brand, while having a very limited range in another brand.

Not saying the above is 'good or bad', but I also don't believe that *every single company* needs to accommodate for *every single consumer*. A brand isn't 'racist' because they have limited shade ranges. But it's also the right of consumers and consumer groups to advocate against those same companies.

Ultimately, it'll always come down to $$$. If it costs more (either to produce, or in lost revenue) to be inclusive, they just won't do it... or they'll buy out or launch another brand that meets those requirements."
5486,2020-08-15 03:43:43,i9wqxt,I think the two things that most makeup wearers are sick of rn are too big palettes and boring nude palettes. That’s exactly what this palette is: boring and useless. I honestly think he thinks his fans are dumb and will eat up anything he shits out.
5487,2020-08-15 02:07:18,i9wqxt,Looks like a morphe palette. A million shades of beige brown.
5488,2020-08-15 00:40:53,i9wqxt,"I honestly think I have most of the colors in other palettes, Jafar star isn’t doing anything new. I prefer greige or grey toned browns/nudes and I have them. I can’t justify the prices for his makeup either, I have used much better lipsticks and shadows, Australis, LaSplash, Fenty and Storybook Cosmetics are generally my go to’s. I’ve only ever bought the ‘Mini controversy’ palette from Jafar and it’s good, it’s not great tho. The size of the shadow pans are nice and decent tho. 🤷🏼‍♀️"
5489,2020-08-15 02:29:39,i9wqxt," It's odd how people are so keen to jump on indie brands and ""cancel"" them for relatively minor imdescretions. I'm not necessarily talking about Star here, I keep seeing the same pattern over and over with different brands. 

While big brands do far worse stuff, like, on the daily... 😓

I don't want to go all wake up sheeple but really. I think people are being manipulated  by a very competitive industry that is keen to weaponise your emotional response to a brand in order to take out a competitor. The way the dialogue goes... I see people acting more like a spurned lover than a rational consumer making a brand choice. The whole thing just stinks of social media manipulation tactics."
5490,2020-08-15 05:06:57,i9wqxt,I'm super out of the loop on all this - is your beef with the brand or with this particular palette?
5491,2020-08-15 01:10:11,i9wqxt,"Interesting, I read through that. Do you think they’ve made the changes? I hope so."
5492,2020-08-15 09:32:31,i9wqxt,"I’m a super pale girl and while I do get annoyed that the lightest shade in a range is sometimes too orange and dark, I acknowledge it’s a privilege because 80% of the colours are for white people"
5493,2020-08-15 04:44:54,i9wqxt,Thank you omfg! I'm so sick of white people sooking about their shade range and im fucking white.
5494,2020-08-15 03:55:27,i9wqxt,"Genuinely curious, not trying to be contrarian. I know the whole “lipstick nazi” thing is why I peaced out with his brand. What has he done more recently that’s problematic?"
5495,2020-08-15 13:45:21,i9wqxt,Yes this is exactly how I feel. If you look into the history of boycotting it’s really complex and often disappointing. Nestle for instance never suffered due to their numerous disgusting controversies but there were laws passed that did help curb some of the issues they were culpable for. I never praise huge companies for good shade ranges or feminism like Dove because they aren’t doing anything but showcasing the bare minimum - what is the corporate culture? Usually horrendous and bigoted! Pull Up or Shut Up was a great initiative but won’t really change these companies unless there is consistent years long pressure on governments to enact proper policies.
5496,2020-08-15 13:56:05,i9wqxt,I agree. I think due to social media and especially Twitter (imo) there is a huge magnifying lens on every wrongdoing of a company. I remember when Tati Westbrook released her vitamins it was like... the fabric of the beauty community was being ripped a part. Also apparently a common vitamin ingredient used in many vitamins may potentially mess with your contraceptive pill... but like holy shit that was awful. I don’t support her and I shouldn’t have to say that but that incident stuck out to me as quite problematic.
5497,2020-08-15 09:35:57,i9wqxt,"Jeffree Star has been involved in a LOT of controversy, the latest involving Shane Dawson that ended with Jeffree’s makeup line no longer being sold by Morphe. https://www.insider.com/shane-dawson-tati-westbrook-video-jeffree-star-drama-timeline-cancelled-2020-6?amp"
5498,2020-08-15 01:34:38,i9wqxt,"I’ve no idea! I do know some beauty influencers have cut ties with them and don’t really associate anymore — Jackie Aina and Alissa Ashley, I believe — but as for actual changes, who knows. The brand as a whole went underground after the scandal."

5500,2020-08-15 12:17:50,i9wqxt,So the controversy is that this very controversial brand released a new product?
5501,2020-08-15 13:48:36,i9wqxt,Yes to add onto that he has now been implicated in revenge porn and actively protecting child sex offenders as well as lying about numerous parts of his personal and professional life (his big robbery was only about 10k loss of products)

5504,2020-08-15 16:52:06,i9w94f,because talking about a controversial subreddit like that will get flooded with hate and people will go over there to mess around. This can get subreddits shut down.
5505,2020-08-14 20:52:21,i9ts4h,I'm opposite. I buy a highlighter to use as a eyeshadow topper and brow/inner corner highlight as none of my eyeshadows worked. Maybe one but it was too white. I agree though  many make up products are interchangeable.
5506,2020-08-14 20:44:15,i9ts4h,"As a naturally very oily girl, I’ve stopped buying highlighter and leaned into my natural gloss 🤣🤣🤣"
5507,2020-08-14 23:50:01,i9ts4h,"when im getting ready in the morning and im in a rush, i swipe on my abh amrezy highlighter on my lid as eyeshadow and use my hoola lite bronzer color as a crease color lol. it goes together really well, and since i have those products on my face anyways, it gives the entire face a cohesive look still."
5508,2020-08-15 01:21:51,i9ts4h,I feel like eyeshadows don’t have the right texture or subtle sheen most of the time
5509,2020-08-14 21:36:43,i9ts4h,Remember: all makeup is an invented need. But especially highlighter haha!
5510,2020-08-14 23:32:04,i9ts4h,"I returned Becca Champagne Pop when I noticed it looked exactly the same as one of my eyeshadows (Urban Decay Blunt). Didn’t seem like there was a point to having both. I would absolutely encourage those looking for variety to try to recreate a product with their existing products. 

If the pan size is too small in the existing product, you can just repress it into a larger pan. 

If it’s too pigmented, you can “cut” it with some translucent powder so it’s less pigmented."
5511,2020-08-14 23:59:06,i9ts4h,I’m using an expensive “diamond powder” glitter highlighter and recently got upset because I found a better one for $5 at Francescas. It’s called body glitter. 😂 I bought it for my nails (which it also works great for). It’s from the brand Stardust and honestly I’ve found so many uses for it that would have saved me money had I known sooner. I prefer it over my diamond powder because it’s a gel and stays put. No fallout 🤦🏻‍♀️
5512,2020-08-15 04:40:33,i9ts4h,"See, I started experimenting with highlighter application by using eyeshadows, but they left a dark cast on my skin when the light wasn't hitting it directly, which kinda defeated the purpose. The dedicated highlighters I bought are invisible until the light hits it, which is exactly what I want. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯"
5513,2020-08-15 03:12:53,i9ts4h,"So weird because as a pale af person, I don’t have many (if any) eyeshadows that would work as a highlight, unless I was going for something super blinding. I need like a super light, sheer formula for highlight or it looks crazy."
5514,2020-08-14 21:22:08,i9ts4h,I feel this way about blush! Mostly bc I think the highlighter-type shades of eyeshadow I have seem to highlight only my texture but I haven't bought a blush in years and feel no need to do so
5515,2020-08-15 00:12:27,i9ts4h,"Also highlighters actually last *forever*, so nobody needs more than 1 in the same shade/finish. Ever."
5516,2020-08-14 23:43:11,i9ts4h,"I’m going to be honest, I have used eyeshadows and lipsticks as cheek products bc I can’t be bothered to buy new products"
5517,2020-08-15 08:10:45,i9ts4h,"Kind of yes and no. Yes, because those shades are often so similar, they're interchangeable for most people, the same with bronzers, blushes and contour. No, because eyeshadows are often much more intense, also smaller pans can make application difficult. Another con for me as a pale girl is that highligh-like shades are often darker that my skin tone or have a dark base, so I actually do opposite, using highlighter as an eyeshadow.

And to be honest, you don't need makeup in general, you want it. It's not bad, but this distinction should be kept in mind."
5518,2020-08-14 23:07:58,i9ts4h,"My favorite eyeshadow IS what I use as a highlighter. And I've never seen a single highlighter ever come close to as satisfying as that one is. Been using it for two years. Still haven't hit pan. Couldn't possibly agree more with your sentiment, OP."
5519,2020-08-15 01:32:09,i9ts4h,Same with contour and blush! That's why I love matte palettes because everything is interchangeable.
5520,2020-08-14 23:58:07,i9ts4h,I got a darker highlighter in my lunar beauty mystery box and I use it more as a bronzer.  The loose highlighters are also good for using a pinch with your setting powder and they last forever.
5521,2020-08-15 03:52:48,i9ts4h,I think I end up doing more of the reverse (using highlighter as eyeshadow) but you’re definitely right! I actually do use Aura from Venus I as a highlighter pretty regularly.
5522,2020-08-15 06:54:09,i9ts4h,"i think highlighter was a fad imho. they tried to sell it as a must have. it doesnt look good in natural light and looks good in photos depending on application, assuming you have the best lighting. in daily life, its either not noticeable or too much (like it highlights skin texture badly)"
5523,2020-08-15 04:32:24,i9ts4h,i use two faced highlighter right under my eyebrow to make it really pop!
5524,2020-08-15 04:38:58,i9ts4h,It’s all the same thing over and over. I tend to use highlighter as eyeshadow bc it’s sheer and more finely milled
5525,2020-08-15 13:34:07,i9ts4h,"The great thing about using eyeshadow elsewhere and not the other way round: other products on the eye area, is that you don't have to worry if it's safe for use on the eye area! Especially if you are applying near the rims of your eyes, or if product can transfer. 

As much as it was too much fuss over nothing, remember neon ""eyeshadow""?

5526,2020-08-15 13:50:51,i9ts4h,I do this. I have so many shimmery shadow that I dont use. Just occasionally dab a tiny bit on my upper cheeks . i also use lip color as blush on occasion. Its an old trick.
5527,2020-08-15 16:24:26,i9ts4h,I have used plain lip balm and my greasiest sunscreen as a highlighter at times.
5528,2020-08-16 15:20:40,i9ts4h,"This was the reason I used to never buy highlighter, because I'd use eyeshadow. But then I got sucked into the trap anyway. And now I have like 4 highlighter palettes and one individual pan that I'm trying to work through. I def use them as eyeshadow too. I think I'm going to start using them on my body too, as I was originally planning on doing before covid hit."
5529,2020-08-20 01:53:21,i9ts4h,"Highlighter is definitely not as hard pressed as eyeshadow.  I know this because I drop my highlighters all the time and they shatter into a million pieces.  That being said, yes they are pretty much the same thing and a waste of money.  Becca highlighters are $40 (with tax)  you can get the same results with a friggin eyeshadow!!!!"
5530,2020-08-15 07:43:53,i9ts4h,I will say maybe I feel this way because i own a good selection of eyeshadows so if one shimmer is not the right color or texture I have like 15-20 others to choose from. I know a lot of people aren't eyeshadow addicts. Just saying there's no reason to buy a blue highlighter you will use 10 times total unless you're dying to throw your money at a rich person.
5531,2020-08-15 01:08:55,i9ts4h,I've never even heard of using eyeshadow as highlighter
5532,2020-08-15 13:39:56,i9ts4h,"I do like having a separate highlighter to use but it’s the only category of my makeup where I don’t feel the need to explore further. I have one blinding cool highlighter, one subtle highlighter, and one warm glowy highlighter and that’s enough for me! (In comparison for lipsticks/blushes/eyeshadow i like exploring all different types of textures and finishes which might be why i have a gazillion red lipsticks that look similar 😅)

Tl;dr - I don’t think the average makeup user has the need to explore highlighter a lot as in the end the only major difference is the intensity/brightness imo (ofc your opinion might be different and that’s totally okay!!!)"
5533,2020-08-15 08:34:43,i9ts4h,Terra moon cosmetics iridescent eyeshadows are GREAT as highliter!
5534,2020-08-15 12:34:57,i9ts4h,Agree 100% with u op
5535,2020-08-14 22:52:13,i9ts4h,"Same. I've found that highlighter usually spreads more loosely and evenly. When I've tried to wear eye shadow as highlighter, I've often found it awkward to blend."
5536,2020-08-15 03:09:44,i9ts4h,"Personally, I feel like highlighter works better as eyeshadow than eyeshadow for highlighter. Sometimes I just pop it on the lid and go! It looks great!"
5537,2020-08-14 21:07:46,i9ts4h,yea I guess you could just mattify the areas you don't want to shine
5538,2020-08-14 23:46:36,i9ts4h,you're naturally dewy!
5539,2020-08-15 00:15:31,i9ts4h,"I do exactly the same! Just with Becca Moonstone highlight (more natural than champagne pop) - plus I love how my face and eyes share the same colours, looks nice & uniform / natural."
5540,2020-08-15 03:32:05,i9ts4h,"That’s a great idea for an everyday look, I might use that!"
5541,2020-08-15 00:25:30,i9ts4h,"And 10 shades of the same brown on a palette and of course, primer"
5542,2020-08-15 07:33:45,i9ts4h,Thats cool as long as it's safe for whatever youre using it for. I never heard of Francescas befrore
5543,2020-08-15 08:03:10,i9ts4h,yea i mean it only works if you have enough options to find the right base tone
5544,2020-08-14 22:15:26,i9ts4h,How do you apply blush from such a small pan though? I love the idea of that because I have a ton of coral eyeshadows but it seems like a pain to try and get my giant brush in to the small pan or use a small brush that gonna apply too much product
5545,2020-08-15 00:13:43,i9ts4h,"I'm the same but opposite! The big blush pans and big blush brushes make my morning brain so relieved, especially if I'm in a rush. Just smush it around my face and done!"
5546,2020-08-15 14:56:15,i9ts4h,"As someone with too many highlighters, you don't even need different shades that champagne/peach/pearl/rose gold highlight looks the same after you blend it out"
5547,2020-08-15 07:24:01,i9ts4h,"Yup. I own the coverfx highlighting liquid drops and wow, I will never ever get through it. I mix in with my moisturizer for extra glow during summer, and I barely use half a drop each time. I regret buying it. 

In addition I own two other highlighters. They’re going to last me the next 20+ years."
5548,2020-08-15 11:57:37,i9ts4h,Relevant username!
5549,2020-08-14 23:57:03,i9ts4h,Can you tell us what it is that you use?
5550,2020-08-15 01:13:33,i9ts4h,Exactly
5551,2020-08-15 07:30:08,i9ts4h,oh yea I've seen so many people do their contour with eyeshadow.
5552,2020-08-16 04:08:51,i9ts4h,there's a lot of variables. If you use the right highlighter wisely it can create beautiful illusions. it's just a good way to draw certain areas forward or accentuate them when the light hits them. It's not for everyone. Keep in mind a lot of people actually use advanced techniques for work or for fun. I don't think the average woman really needs highlight in her makeup arsenal. it's extra
5553,2020-08-16 04:12:44,i9ts4h,YESSS.. I get a lil sketched out how people casually just put everything on their eyes. If its safe for my lids probably safe for my face. Not so much the other way around
5554,2020-08-16 05:53:35,i9ts4h,ha that's pretty funny. Yea i'd be careful about that a lot of lipbalms ingredients are not good for skin.
5555,2020-08-29 05:38:05,i9ts4h,"Idk I feel like it depends on the brand. People say the same thing about the finish, that the highlighter is more finely milled, but I have shadows in every texture under the sun. Like ABH eyeshadow is so loosely packed that they pan themselves lol"
5556,2020-08-15 01:30:15,i9ts4h,I was doing this in the early 2000s before “highlighters” and “beauty gurus”. Most makeup products are multi purpose. The beauty industry has made it so you need a product for everything now. Why? To make themselves more money!!!
5557,2020-08-15 01:19:29,i9ts4h,first time for everything
5558,2020-08-16 04:05:49,i9ts4h,Love to try them... weird how so many people think all shimmer eyeshoadows have the same level of grit when they come in every texture and grit you can imagine. Same for highlighter
5559,2020-08-14 23:55:17,i9ts4h,"Yeah, it’s usually sheerer than most eyeshadows."
5560,2020-08-15 00:38:04,i9ts4h,I think it depends on the eyeshadow’s formula. I don’t like a lot of shimmer eyeshadow’s as highlighter since most are too glittery/my brush can’t comfortably fit in there.
5561,2020-08-15 00:23:18,i9ts4h,"I recommend using blush on more than just the cheeks. A bit on the temples, neck, and (depending on the pigment) nose can pull the face together. I'm really pale, so bronzer looks a bit rough on me if I'm not doing full face and this brings color back to my face!"
5562,2020-08-15 01:26:31,i9ts4h,"I agree except for the primer part. My oily eyelids will make my shadow and liner migrate to my cheeks more often than not without primer. With primer, I can totally slap on some fresh shadow and touch up my wings on those inevitable days when I fall asleep almost immediately after work thanks to having to clock in before the roosters and Jesus wake up."
5563,2020-08-15 08:17:33,i9ts4h,"It’s a clothing store but they also sell knock knacks, jewelry, and random stuff. It’s a body shimmer. It gave me ideas on how to make my own body shimmers out of my highlighter and blush collection. It’s been interesting staying home this much 😅"
5564,2020-08-14 22:23:06,i9ts4h,"I use my fingers to tap it onto my cheeks, then blend it out with my regular brush"
5565,2020-08-14 23:02:48,i9ts4h,"Use a smaller fluffy brush meant for blending. Tap into pan lightly, start by tapping either side of your cheeks, then blend. If it's a super pigmented formula, you can tap the back of your hand or on a piece of tissue to get rid of the excess first. Also, if you lightly powder your cheeks first, you'll have an easier time blending. I usually don't bother because I'm working with low-pigment eyeshadow!"
5566,2020-08-14 22:25:43,i9ts4h,"Yes same for highlighter for me- the bigger pan makes it easier to blend out over a larger area. Some eyeshadow in bigger pans would work and sometimes I use a smaller brush,  but I guess I can see ‘the point’ of a large highlighter beyond the money-making for the company"
5567,2020-08-15 01:28:26,i9ts4h,I have some random Ipsy blush sample that’s not much bigger than the pans in UD Gwen palette. And I just make sure I swish my whole entire brush around in it before application. Does it take more time than a larger pan? Yes. Does that mean I’m gonna cut it out and get a larger pan for convenience sake? NERP.
5568,2020-08-15 16:29:50,i9ts4h,Omg LOL I just noticed ahaha.
5569,2020-08-15 00:12:36,i9ts4h,"Yes please, I was on the edge of my seat waiting for them to say what product they’re using."
5570,2020-08-15 00:14:11,i9ts4h,"It's a MAC mineralize eyeshadow in the shade Fresh Ice. It was a limited release from years ago. One day I may find a dupe, haven't yet."
5571,2020-08-16 06:22:05,i9ts4h,"I guess it would depend on your skin. I don’t get acne, so it works well for me."
5572,2020-08-15 01:48:40,i9ts4h,What I'm starting to realize too... I wonder how many other products were unnecessarily created
5573,2020-08-17 22:07:18,i9ts4h,"""The roosters and Jesus""😂"
5574,2020-08-15 00:20:44,i9ts4h,"I always use a neutral powder between my foundation/concealer/cream and powders! Normally I use a setting powder because its not pigmented. Then I go through with whatever face powder I want. Also- use blush on more than just the apple of your cheeks! Throw some on your temples and neck too, especially if you're very light and bronzer can be too dark."
5575,2020-08-16 04:03:27,i9ts4h,exactly why do people act like it's rocket science to just dip part of your brush turn then dip the other side? It's pretty easy. People are just conditioned to think they need a big pan and a giant brush. i actually think i get better results with a smaller brush. Plus plenty of eyeshadows come in large pans.
5576,2020-08-16 09:26:00,i9ts4h,Well it really depends on the ingredients. Just because you don't see immediate problems doesn't mean it isn't causing damage.
5577,2020-08-15 01:49:59,i9ts4h,"Lash primers, lip primers, face primers, they’re not necessary but they can be beneficial I suppose"
5578,2020-08-16 09:35:40,i9ts4h,"I try to buy lip balm with ingredients that are good for my skin, as a general rule 😂"
5579,2020-08-15 03:03:27,i9ts4h,"As someone who never used primer or setting spray I can confirm that both of these products do make your makeup last longer. I was always so upset when my makeup wore off so fast. Now with primer and setting spray, the same stuff stays in place for 10 hours. Do you need it? Not if you don’t need your makeup to last."
5580,2020-08-16 09:39:43,i9ts4h,i'm pointing it out also because this is a public thread and I want to discourage people from doing harmful things. What do you use anyway? I occasionally put lip products on my face but don't make a habit of it
5581,2020-08-15 04:27:38,i9ts4h,oh if i don't use primer my foundation looks really bad. lot of emphasized texture.
5582,2020-08-15 07:32:30,i9ts4h,I guess it depends on your skin and climate. Mine is dry and the only thing I need is a really emollient moisturiser and/or some oil. I usually love how my makeup looks at the end of the day when it’s ‘worn in’. The only area I usually have to retouch is under eyes and lips.
5583,2020-08-16 09:46:06,i9ts4h,"Lanolips tinted lip balm is marketed to be used on lips and as a blush on cheeks.

I have used lots of products called lip and cheek tints on my cheeks.

I have used spf 50+ lip balm as highlighter and brow grooming product. It’s been fine. 

Lots of people use lipstick as a cream blush.

As long as it doesn’t break you out, it’s no problem. It’s never caused me any problems.

I’m sure anyone reading this can make a safe decision what they will put where."
5584,2020-08-15 04:57:29,i9ts4h,"I agree, BUT I have also used some and see some in the market that promise all sorts of things that they don’t do. I remember one from Smashbox that claimed to help with dark spots. Just no."
5585,2020-08-16 23:39:53,i9ts4h,okay to clarify it's not just acne you need to worry about and the adverse effects can take years to show up. I looked at the ingredients of lanolip cheek and I don't think anyone should be putting limonene on their face on a semi-regular basis. It's classified as a sensitizing chemical and it's something that nearly every expert says to avoid. When exposed to air it's pretty volatile. Then the first ingredient is Lanolin which has several problems.
5586,2020-08-17 01:55:36,i9ts4h,Oh my god. It’s not what you would do. I get it. People can make different choices to you. This is just fear mongering at this point.
5587,2020-08-17 05:38:09,i9ts4h,Show me where I said people should do what i say? Never happened sis. I just want people to actually be informed. That's rude for no reason. I was polite to you and just talking facts. Why are you so defensive over me talking about ingredients? Fear Mongering? LMAO  Go ahead and ruin your skin see if I care but this a PUBLIC thread an i want anyone else who sees this to understand the ingredients you put on your face matter. It's not fear mongering is science. I don't care if you're triggered by the fact limonene is a well known volatile chemical every expert says to avoid. Have fun being willfully ignorant and rude on top of it
5588,2020-08-17 05:45:53,i9ts4h,"‘Haha that’s pretty funny’ was rude. My skin is not ruined. For the most part, I do avoid limonene, but I’ve yet to find an spf 30 tinted lip balm without some sort of scent, so in those cases, I use it. Lanolin is fine for some people, not others. I can’t use 100% lanolin anywhere on my face, but mixed with other things, it’s fine for me. Good, even.

Limonene is one of those things you educate yourself about and make your own decision. I avoid scented makeup and skincare wherever possible, so I don’t feel that having scented lip tints that provides spf is that big of a deal. Hence why I said I *generally* choose lip products with good ingredients. I do my best with what is currently available.

I don’t see why you feel a need to berate me for a personal choice I made for myself. I use this product. Nothing bad has happened. YMMV. And whether you agree with people’s choices about limonene or not, lots of people use them and talk about it and they’re allowed to do so.

I’m 46. For years, I was probably using lots of limonene products for decades without realising it, before I knew about the science. If I was going to have adverse affects, they would probably have presented themselves on my skin by now. That said, I do keep usage of that ingredient low."
5589,2020-08-17 05:57:48,i9ts4h,"SMH NO. NO ONE SHOULD BE USING ANY MAKEUP WITH LIMONENE. Girl... lips skin is not like face skin so again not the point and just because it's a common ingredient doesn't change anything... Every time you spread dangerous info I'm gonna keep correcting you... Way to miss the point of everything i said. Looks like you were too busy being defensive over something that has nothing to do with you to get the point. 
It's not about YOU this a a public thread and you are saying it's fine to not question spreading volatile chemicals on your face just because it hasn't given you acne when i explained several times the damage could take years to set in and and the effects can be hard to reverse.... 
This doesn't just effect you but you're so self-centered you can't grasp that. ""it's fine for some people"" SO WHAT? That doesn't mean it should go unaddressed and yes saying I'm fear mongering was so rude, and just not true SMH. 
If you cant handle me responding to your comment on MY post while staying totally on topic then don't comment maybe? You got snotty because i had the nerve to disagree with you and actually explain why i felt that way. 

You're willfully ignorant spreading misinformation that could actually hurt people. I personally have been hurt by this kind of thing so i actually care about preventing others from being harmed but all you care about is YOU."
5590,2020-08-17 06:02:07,i9ts4h,I don't give a crap what choice you make. Inject limonene for all i care. I'm still gonna say it's bad for you
5591,2020-08-14 20:39:59,i9tiyj,"I don’t hate it, I’m just not sure if it’s something I feel like I need. Especially at $62"
5592,2020-08-14 20:56:26,i9tiyj,"I like the mini, not sure about the big one. I havent watched his video yet as im at work but hopefully after that ill get a better idea of what it looks like in ""person""."
5593,2020-08-14 20:44:26,i9tiyj,"I really like the mini, i don't use nudes so the big one ain't for me tho. But the rest of the collection i love, the new glosses look so good and the Mirror and swimsuit... love it"
5594,2020-08-14 21:21:15,i9tiyj,"I think I’ll get the mini palette. I love his shimmers but I wouldn’t be able to use a lot of the shades in big one, plus I just got a 9 pan neutral palette from colour pop that works great for me. I do hate how much his shipping costs though (and I live in California!) Makes it hard to just buy something small. Maybe I’ll get one of the travel makeup bags just to make the shipping worth it."
5595,2020-08-14 20:47:25,i9tiyj,I love the new merch.
5596,2020-08-14 20:30:48,i9tiyj,"I love nude, neutral palettes but this screams to me Beautybay palette... I don't want to be rude
I love his stuff"
5597,2020-08-14 21:03:55,i9tiyj,"They are both beautiful, but I have so many dupes and options already including his other palettes, I cant justify buying either but I might snag a new powder and beaded glass gloss"
5598,2020-08-14 21:00:28,i9tiyj,"Personally, I LOVE the concept for this palette. ""Nude"" has been incorrectly represented as code for 'neutral beige' in makeup, fashion, bandaids, etc. For a brand to come out with a universal nude palette is amazing! **Low-key this palette has a bigger shade range than most foundations.**

I know a lot of people are disappointed there are no metallics but nude is *supposed to represent skin tone*... last time I checked, we aren't Edward from Twilight 😂"
5599,2020-08-15 01:10:18,i9tiyj,He should have maybe mixed the big one with mattes and shimmers it looks kinda boring just all mattes. I absolutely love the shimmers he creates and would maybe get these just cuz I love nudes but I cannot afford both at the minute lol
5600,2020-08-15 05:37:53,i9tiyj,the mini looks a bit like the 24k skin frost pro palette
5601,2020-08-14 22:08:21,i9tiyj,"Gonna pass on the big one, but I want the mini just for that coral shade"
5602,2020-08-14 23:08:24,i9tiyj,"I love the idea and look of this palette, but in the video all the shades look light, almost washed out compared to this promotional photo.

If it turns out the palette is really closer to these colors here, I'll consider it later down the line because I was considering getting Blood Sugar for the few nudes my color in there. My current nude mini-palette runs really pink.

But like... the idea of all-mattes? Me likie! The mini shimmer palette is really cool, I think that was a great choice for a complimenting mini.

Might have to give the setting powder a try for sure, I've just tried a random drug store one and wasn't impressed. And powder looks fun to use.c: Love the rose gold components\~\~

Otherwise his apparel/merch still hasn't stuck out for me, I just got the blue chrome mirror for decor."
5603,2020-08-15 01:39:31,i9tiyj,"I love the new liquid lip shades BUT I have so many of those minis already I think. So unfortunately probably going to skip this one as well. 

I like the eyeshadow palette but since I don’t wear makeup everyday I have enough nudes from his others to get by, especially with cremated. It’s a gorgeous palette though!"
5604,2020-08-14 20:32:46,i9tiyj,"I feel like half of the shades on the dark skin swatch just come out like chalk, like realistically if I were to buy this I could only use the last 2-3 rows, kinda disappointing compared to his previous palettes’ ability to work on darker skin tones"
5605,2020-08-14 21:23:51,i9tiyj,"AAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!! i neeeeeeeeed thissssssss.

I've legit been waiting for him to do a nude pallete since the day I was born."
5606,2020-08-14 22:08:08,i9tiyj,I love a nude pallette and the fact it's matte makes it perfect. I love matte eyeshadow. 🥰
5607,2020-08-14 20:25:31,i9tiyj,"These names have me rolling! Oh. I’m going to enjoy hearing makeup artists use shadows name. 
It’s beautiful 😍"
5608,2020-08-14 20:44:17,i9tiyj,Not really a fan but I don't wear nudes as it is and if I did.. I have plenty in his other palettes. Also the price.. yikes.The only things that really caught my eye were the chocolate mirror and the pullover.
5609,2020-08-14 21:47:43,i9tiyj,I love it and I love that the main palette is all mattes! I am so excited!
5610,2020-08-14 21:57:55,i9tiyj,"honestly, I really want both palettes and some of the new merch. I love his products and the quality is SO worth the price."
5611,2020-08-14 22:25:36,i9tiyj,"This one isn't for me. I do use nudes, but I have no need for that many of them, especially at $62. I'd probably only use 5 of them. I can't wait to see the looks that other people create with it though."
5612,2020-08-14 23:11:05,i9tiyj,I’m excited to get the mini! I’m still very new to eye makeup and don’t really know how to “do” eyeshadow. I’m planning on putting the shimmer/metallic shades on my lid for a little fun without being too adventurous. I’ve been watching and enjoying Jeffree for about 2 years and finally he’s made an eye product that I would use!
5613,2020-08-14 22:01:07,i9tiyj,"This is everything. I am absolutely buying both palettes, 4 of the lip glosses and a magic star luminous powder."
5614,2020-08-14 21:02:27,i9tiyj,I can’t wait to get both palettes they are stunning 🥰
5615,2020-08-14 21:32:32,i9tiyj,"Am I crazy or am I seeing two different shades called ""Explicit""? One in the main and one in the mini.  I'm a bit of a makeup noob so I'm not sure if that's a common thing or not haha."
5616,2020-08-14 22:05:12,i9tiyj,Damn it... I don’t know why I was hoping it’d be the colors of New Nude with the Jeffree formula 😭😭
5617,2020-08-15 15:23:44,i9tiyj,"As a collector.....I added up everything...Merch...everything...with state sales tax....over &1,000 for everything.....SHOOK!"
5618,2020-08-15 22:38:54,i9tiyj,"I have been been WAITING for his nude collection, and I am very disappointed in the large palette, tbh. I think I'd use 1/3 of the colors. For me, it's mostly because they're all mattes, there are no satins or shimmers, and the mini is all metallics. I think this pallette is better suited for a MUA working with different skin tones moreso than just my pale self. And not interested in the lipstick vault.

I decided I am going to get the mini (I drooled over the metallic swatches) and 3 or 4 of the glosses. I have been waiting to buy a mirror until he released a rose gold one. I wish the tone was slightly more golden than a baby pink, but I'm going to get it."
5619,2020-08-14 21:46:47,i9tiyj,"This just seems super redundant? He already has so many nudes in the collection and Cremated was already dipping into nudes territory. This price plus the fact that the beauty bay palette is... the same, I don’t get it"
5620,2020-08-15 00:10:27,i9tiyj,i love that he made an all matte palette! But I prefer pinker shades to brownish nude shades so this palette isn’t really for my taste. I hope he applies the matte concept to some future palettes tho
5621,2020-08-15 05:43:43,i9tiyj,My boyfriend said it looked like someone grinded up different portions of a pig
5622,2020-08-14 20:37:16,i9tiyj,I'm so excited so beautiful.  The only thing I'm disappointed in was the price of the mini lippie bundle.
5623,2020-08-15 14:54:16,i9tiyj,Do we know if they are eyeshadows or pressed pigments? I’m allergic to pressed pigments meaning I already can’t use half my blood sugar!
5624,2020-08-15 14:33:33,i9tiyj,"Well I love this nude palette and the fact that it’s all matte, yes finally a full matte palette and the metallic on the side with the mini!

And I’m in love with the lipstick collection 💖

Then the price, ouchhhh... $62 for the palette, $160 for the lipsticks... 

So I’m not yet sure on my next week move, I talked to Hubby and he told me to treat myself 🖤

But I better to wear makeup every fucking single day!"
5625,2020-08-14 23:13:02,i9tiyj,Meh. BH Ultimate Neutrals palette did it better and waaaaaaaay less expensive.
5626,2020-08-17 05:49:14,i9tiyj,"It looks really nice! I won’t be buying, I’m probably fairer than the person modeling the swatches and most of them would probably look washed out on me. I have hooded eyes so the mini shimmer palette is probably not a good option for me either, but I love the concept of a huge matte palette and then the complementary mini with shimmers. Maybe I’ll change my mind after seeing some looks. Thanks for the post!"
5627,2020-08-18 17:53:52,i9tiyj,"I’m so interested in the vault but since it’s ONLY nudes I wonder if I’ll even be able to use them up before they expire. Many of them also look the same. Thinking if I should find 1 person and split them 50/50. Divvy up what lip they want, I want etc.."
5628,2020-08-19 20:01:04,i9tiyj,I really want the mini orgy palette but I don’t think want to support him anymore - does anyone know if there is any drug store dupes??
5629,2020-08-22 01:31:45,i9tiyj,does anyone know of a dupe for the lipstick shade jeffree’s nudes?? it’s so pretty.
5630,2020-08-22 02:38:14,i9tiyj,Where are his palettes made?
5631,2020-08-22 13:10:22,i9tiyj,I’ve bought the mini as I feel I would get a lot out of it . I just don’t think I’d use the other . Also I’m trying to not buy makeup I know I’m not going to use !
5632,2020-08-26 17:46:49,i9tiyj,"Oof, the matte swatches look rough.
Disappointed about the shadows but will probably purchase a gloss and luminous powder"
5633,2020-08-29 01:56:44,i9tiyj,I love nudes but this looks chalky. My black skin could never
5634,2020-08-14 22:21:10,i9tiyj,I want the mini kind of but I really don’t want the big one. I hate brown eyeshadow and I’m not a big matte eyeshadow person. I’m still gunna get it eventually cuz I’m a collector but I’m not in a hurry
5635,2020-08-14 21:54:10,i9tiyj,I was hoping he wouldn't give into the people who kept asking for a nude palette but here we are. I like the mini and will def get that and the lip glosses.
5636,2020-08-17 07:08:11,i9tiyj,How does gender fluid have to do with orgies?
5637,2020-08-14 22:53:59,i9tiyj,Yeah i watched the video and I was like oh lol like I know people have been wanting this but I guess I'm just not a nude person. I like the amount of neutral colors he offers in the regular palettes and theyve always been enough for me so I'm not sure this is something I'll end up buying. The glosses were pretty cute though and the metallic shades were okay
5638,2020-08-14 22:29:06,i9tiyj,I personally only own Jeffree pallets so my nude options are limited. I’m excited for this one
5639,2020-08-16 04:42:36,i9tiyj,$62 dollars isn’t too bad considering some prices I’ve seen other pallets going for about the same size. I really liked the lipstick vault when he said $162 dollars I was like hell no im not even sure if they are full-size lipsticks. The glosses didn’t wow me at all. All in all I might buy the new setting powder but that’s about it.
5640,2020-08-16 00:55:46,i9tiyj,He doesn’t do any live swatches. :/
5641,2020-08-14 21:55:17,i9tiyj,Beautylish will sell the collection aswel!
5642,2020-08-16 01:17:07,i9tiyj,"Can u compare his shimmers? Trying to get an idea. For reference my fave shimmers are Charlotte Tilbury because they almost look wet. Worse are Kylie’s, not sure if she fixed her formula but they are terrible and wear off In an hour with no staying power. ABH, UD are second to me. I might get the mini and that would be my first JSC palette. Thnx"
5643,2020-08-15 04:12:40,i9tiyj,I like the merch more than the actual makeup..
5644,2020-08-14 20:36:56,i9tiyj,It screamed the same to me!! I actually gasped out loud when he said the price because the beautybay palette is one of many incredibly similar palettes that are more affordable....
5645,2020-08-15 16:06:27,i9tiyj,https://www.instagram.com/p/CD6RckKpmFO/?igshid=co7ilb7bv9fg other dupes
5646,2020-08-14 23:47:09,i9tiyj,Any dupe suggestions?
5647,2020-08-14 22:07:05,i9tiyj,"The shade range for foundation is good because you're blending to fit yours and blend with the skin. More inclusivity there is more sales. When its on the eyes you're limited to some shade of brown look no matter your tone.

I was hoping at least for some pinks to represent labia or something."
5648,2020-08-16 01:20:43,i9tiyj,"I was thinking this palette could be used as powder concealer for MUA, it would have every skin tone. Also under eye setting powder for every skin tone, as well as brow powder for everyone too."
5649,2020-08-16 06:16:01,i9tiyj,Don't act like a wide range of makeup colors doesn't cover up his reputation for being racist(even within the last year)
5650,2020-08-15 13:08:47,i9tiyj,I was thinking the same exact thing!
5651,2020-08-14 20:37:04,i9tiyj,"I definitely see how some of them looks chalky, a little surprised honestly as the quality looks meh. It ain’t for me. I’m wishing for a pastels palette - it would be so pretty. Kinda wishing he did something like that instead since pastels can be really muted everyday look and when he said nudes with a J* twist I thought we’d get some shades differently."
5652,2020-08-14 21:35:03,i9tiyj,I feel the same way... I was really excited and hoping for something new but it’s such a plain palette... just meh... my bank account is happy though  😂
5653,2020-08-15 05:24:27,i9tiyj,Same I love the names 😂
5654,2020-08-15 01:05:35,i9tiyj,Yes! I’m getting the powder as well
5655,2020-08-14 22:07:31,i9tiyj,Not crazy! Controversy and Mini Controversy both had Diet Root Beer and both Jawbreakers had Bubble Gum :)
5656,2020-08-15 17:51:10,i9tiyj,Oof. Gonna go for it?
5657,2020-08-16 04:12:42,i9tiyj,I've been waiting for a nude palette too but 30 shades is a bit overwhelming for basic me.... wish it was an everyday nude kinda palette
5658,2020-08-16 02:04:51,i9tiyj,"Tell your boyfriend that’s an absolutely masterpiece of weird thinking. I don’t agree, but that is bloody brilliant, and I snorted!"
5659,2020-08-14 20:41:07,i9tiyj,"I must have missed the prices for mini lip bundle, quite tired so must be it. I’m excited over the lipsticks. I’ve been wanting to try them for a long time. I wonder if it hasn’t been better to divvy them up 50/50 instead of one huge. I don’t know where to put it...."
5660,2020-08-15 15:41:30,i9tiyj,"The lipstick vault sounds like alot of money, but actually if you divide $160 by 25 lippies, it totals $6.40 each one....not bad, plus bonus for the vault case.

VLLs: Mini 0.07oz, Full size 0.19oz

I get alot of uses out of those minis. I have both nudes volume 1 & 2 for a little more than a year now, and I've finished several already."
5661,2020-08-15 07:38:04,i9tiyj,"This will probably be my last big order for a while; It's down to only my income now; so I'm going to enjoy this; the chocolate sweater, the lip collection, a couple of minis, and probably all lip glosses going to pass on the big guy for now (cheeky laughter), maybe do another creamated; I think he really worked it on this one, extra everything; extra nude haha;"
5662,2020-08-15 22:30:32,i9tiyj,Oh yeah I should’ve added that I would buy a couple glosses!! I loveeee his glosses!
5663,2020-08-15 22:32:01,i9tiyj,Yeah I get that. I bought the colourpop going coconuts palette about a year ago and still have ways to go with that one. It’s only a 9 pan palette but it’s enough for me at this time!
5664,2020-08-17 01:30:56,i9tiyj,"He did them on his hand but he’s covered in tats so really kinda limited as to where he can swatch. They inserted a clip of them on dark and light skin tones , I like the palette."
5665,2020-08-14 22:05:07,i9tiyj,Is their shipping cost more reasonable?
5666,2020-08-16 07:56:53,i9tiyj,He has several shimmer formulas and I’m not sure which ones are in this palette. The swatches looked like his newer formula which is a more wet formula. There will probably be a turtorial video up before the launch or some reviews that might go in a bit deeper into the shimmers before launch!
5667,2020-08-14 20:39:50,i9tiyj,"https://www.beautybay.com/p/beauty-bay/nude-42-colour-palette/ for example this one , maybe it's the pans"
5668,2020-08-15 17:50:25,i9tiyj,Colourpop bare necessities
5669,2020-08-15 01:42:31,i9tiyj,I thought for sure there would be more pinkish shades! I was hoping there would be
5670,2020-08-15 03:16:22,i9tiyj,Yea like im super pale and i could have definitely done without the top row that is essentially all white or off white. The cremated palette was the same way.
5671,2020-08-14 20:40:24,i9tiyj,"Yeah this release really seems lower quality in the color story and in product than every other one before, but with the Halloween and holiday season coming around hopefully we’ll see more exciting things than this collection. Pastels would have been a way better idea for this palette"
5672,2020-08-15 06:05:53,i9tiyj,But Bubblegum and Diet Root Beer were the same shades... since the main was all-matte and the mini was all-shimmer then the two shades would have to be different in this instance.
5673,2020-08-15 18:01:03,i9tiyj,I unfortunately am going to have to wait on this...I probably will get the vault/mirrors..but PRIORITIES.....something is going on with my one boxer that will need addressed if not improved by Monday...but...thinking of selling 2 of my 2017 Summer Chrome Lipstick Vaults....I don’t know at this point...I know it’s just makeup..but....just very bad timing right now...you?
5674,2020-08-14 20:58:20,i9tiyj,It was $150 I think
5675,2020-08-15 16:07:18,i9tiyj,"I completely get the point of the math part, but usually bundle are supposed to become cheaper... which technically this is the case but only by 23 cents by lipstick...

I love the formula, I already have several mini and full sizes of JSC liquid velour.

It’s more like ouchhhh $160 on a single purchase for a bundle, where I know that I’ll not like all colors..."
5676,2020-08-14 22:06:59,i9tiyj,They have free shipping above $35 to Europe so i can’t imagine their domestic shipping would be a lot! I believe they ship from California aswel and I know they ship way faster then JSC
5677,2020-08-14 23:56:06,i9tiyj,"Ohh I love that pallet! I've never tried Beauty Bay products, how are they? Also some of the reviews on Trustpilot are saying they never received their orders... What's your expirience?"
5678,2020-08-14 20:58:32,i9tiyj,I almost prefer that one because it has shimmers/metallic shades
5679,2020-08-14 20:41:54,i9tiyj,That’s the exact one I thought of 😂
5680,2020-08-14 21:02:46,i9tiyj,I feel like it was rushed to recover from Cremated getting so much backlash.
5681,2020-08-15 18:09:16,i9tiyj,Sorry to hear about your pup. I hope it all works out.
5682,2020-08-14 21:01:13,i9tiyj,I think it was $160.
5683,2020-08-15 16:18:14,i9tiyj,"Yeah, it's alot. I'm on the fence too, but it's beautiful. Well, I have several days to decide. 😅"
5684,2020-08-14 23:16:40,i9tiyj,Oooo...free shipping over $35 in the US too! Thank you!!!
5685,2020-08-14 23:20:33,i9tiyj,"If I remember right, it’s the same for domestic shipping. Pretty dope they have it the same for everyone"
5686,2020-08-15 12:02:06,i9tiyj,"Thanks for this! Thinking about the mini as matte nudes look like crap on me. I think I could only use most those colors as brow and eyeliner powder and the lighter nudes as under eye powder, which I already have. Only shimmer nudes look good on my lids. On the JSC website the $125 minimum for free shipping is a bit much but for $35 I may go with that. Does anyone know what the mini will go for?"
5687,2020-08-15 06:03:54,i9tiyj,"Can’t speak for anyone else, but I’ve only ever had a few minor issues with them, usually with shipping. I’ve paid for next day delivery in the past that was days late and then left with a neighbour when I specifically asked them not to. Parcels are often marked as delivered before they even arrive, which is really annoying *but* that’s all done using a carrier service. 

In terms of quality, the eyeshadows from beautybay’s own palettes aren’t up to the same quality as JSC, but they are more than good enough. Can’t really go wrong for the price!"
5688,2020-08-15 14:24:44,i9tiyj,"I never tried the BB products but ordered multiple times from their website, in fact actually waiting an order since almost two weeks.

I never got my first order, it tools m two months with their CS to finally obtain a refund when in fact I was asking for the products.

Second order, it was supposed to be an express shipping, they made a mistake and I got it 3 weeks later.

I’m waiting my third order and potentially the last one!"
5689,2020-08-14 20:59:23,i9tiyj,Yes!
5690,2020-08-14 20:46:11,i9tiyj,"I even returned 4:28 for the cost of one pan like 2.60 dollars and was like WOT
And the ""Such an ARTISTRY palette""
This is straight up every 3 eyeshadows look for each skin tone and a contouring palette 🤷"
5691,2020-08-15 14:38:12,i9tiyj,"Yeap I confirm the price is $160... I was ouchhhh, it hurts!"
5692,2020-08-14 22:10:14,i9tiyj,">https://www.beautybay.com/p/beauty-bay/nude-42-colour-palette/

Yeah. I love the idea but the price is so much!"
5693,2020-08-15 16:37:48,i9tiyj,"Same here, till Friday to make a decision! Let me know what you’ll get!"
5694,2020-08-15 14:19:45,i9tiyj,The mini will be the usual price of $28
5695,2020-08-15 16:50:49,i9tiyj,Working on my list!🤑
5696,2020-08-15 17:09:23,i9tiyj,"Thnx, this will be my first JSC purchase so wasn’t sure. Looks like I’ll have to get something else to get to the 35$"
5697,2020-08-15 17:43:15,i9tiyj,"Ohhh not at problem at all, I’m sure you’ll find many things ;)
Edit: forget to say but be fast on your order... usually things go out of stock very fast. Then you’ll need to wait till restock."

I can def relate to the whole shy guy/kid in the back of the class hoping not to get called on. It does sound like you are trying your best to do good for yourself though. The suicide attempts are very upsetting because there is so much to live for. You just need to find what makes you happy and figure out how to adjust your life to match those goals. I wish you the best of luck getting your life together and being happy. You are worth it!

 I haven't tried liquid lipsticks from mac but I recently bought a lipstick mini in the shade Velvet Teddy which I loved (a bargain from tj maxx). The regular price I believe is comparable to the Jstar one so :(."

5796,2020-08-10 22:54:08,i7dwjy,Baddest bitch? Who said that?

5800,2020-08-10 21:36:30,i7dwjy,"This is cute coming from someone who associates with people using f*ggot regularly — why is it cute for (white, let’s be honest) gays to reclaim slurs, but not Black people? Like... does she feel excluded/bitter bc she can’t sing along or perform these songs? I’m confused what stake she thinks she has in this discussion.

Also I have endless time for watching Bambi take people down live and publicly."
5801,2020-08-10 22:30:47,i7dwjy,Faux wokeness from a gay white man? color me surprised.
5802,2020-08-11 02:12:46,i7dwjy,who told her she has any place to police the semantics black people use in their music in the first place

imagine that on our screens

imagine rhea, shitron and willam on the same season"

5805,2020-08-11 04:06:52,i7dwjy,It’s kinda funny the two of the most popular queens who appear on every should be on dr lists since like the first season have both been exposed. Good on the casting directors
5806,2020-08-10 22:43:07,i7dwjy,The struggle is real.

Oh no, baby, what is you doin? Someone bout to get cancelled."
5821,2020-08-11 08:25:00,i7dwjy,I saw her stan jeffree in the comments of one of his posts with her black trans power profile pic and the replies to her were an iconic dragging.
5822,2020-08-10 21:54:21,i7dwjy,"How does Rhea, as a white person, feel the need to tell black people what to do? She really can’t mind her own business huh"

5824,2020-08-11 10:41:34,i7dwjy,"was Bambi sitting on that video, waiting for the right time to post?! 👀 that clap-back is lethal!

also: how is JS helping her pay bills? does she post sponsored content with his products? i didn’t think Rheas platform was so big to bring in sponsored posts that can pay rent!"
5825,2020-08-10 22:20:44,i7dwjy,She never will; blacklisted because she outed Raja as s3 winner; allegedly
5826,2020-08-11 00:02:44,i7dwjy,Like wtf even her original point? She wants to police how black people shape black culture?
5827,2020-08-10 23:22:09,i7dwjy,Bitch should have sat there and ate her food

5835,2020-08-10 21:40:44,i7dwjy,That drag family is just full of royalty
5836,2020-08-10 23:23:02,i7dwjy,The Coulee family were stacking up bodies long before they started snatching crowns

5839,2020-08-11 03:09:10,i7dwjy,"Shea still follows Jeffree Star tho. So she def supports at least one racist and his company.

Maybe daughter needs to talk to mother"
5840,2020-08-10 22:12:47,i7dwjy,"""I just don’t know *WHY* this cancel culture fuckin’ exists, bitch!! Cause you know who ELSE needs to get cancelled.. uh, uh, fuckin- uh, **RUPAUL**, mhmm. World Of Wonder is down the street!"""
5841,2020-08-10 22:23:20,i7dwjy,"Am I wrong for thinking Willam is probably exactly the same? I would be completely underwhelmed if similar shit came out about her. She gives me very strong habitual line-crosser vibes and has done for a while. In fact, wasn't there something fairly recently that just ended up not sticking/being eclipsed by a more interesting scandal elsewhere?"
5842,2020-08-10 23:44:36,i7dwjy,"Willam has a somewhat similar sense of humor as Shane Dawson, and so nothing would surprise me at this point."
5843,2020-08-10 23:40:19,i7dwjy,Probably the same she said about Sharon being exposed once again as a pos: absolutely nothing.
5844,2020-08-10 23:33:09,i7dwjy,That part
5845,2020-08-10 23:35:58,i7dwjy,"oh great, there are multiple white people accepting her apology in the replies. including one with a sharon needles tattoo. ouch."
5846,2020-08-10 22:29:49,i7dwjy,“awe full”... full of awe? The N word is full of awe? What a typo. 😬
5847,2020-08-10 22:55:06,i7dwjy,I saw another twitter post that said this video came from Willam’s YouTube page. Never even occurred to Rhea to delete it.
5848,2020-08-11 00:33:14,i7dwjy,"People can learn though. Admitting your past mistakes and letting go of toxic behaviour is admirable, lest we think that any of us is completely without fault. That being said, by blocking people she certainly does not seem to be owning up to her bad behaviour."
5849,2020-08-11 20:32:13,i7dwjy,She did. She had to or no one else would.
5850,2020-08-10 22:12:00,i7dwjy,You mean Bottom Emojis?
5851,2020-08-10 23:38:49,i7dwjy,I never understood that. like is it that much more difficult to find a radio friendly version if you want to perform a song that uses the n word that badly ?
5852,2020-08-10 22:35:21,i7dwjy,Rupaul's hide behind my \~persona\~ to excuse my shitty vile behavior race.

5858,2020-08-10 23:03:47,i7dwjy,Honestly crown them all
5859,2020-08-10 22:46:39,i7dwjy,Willam’s done literal blackface lmao.
5860,2020-08-10 23:35:35,i7dwjy,remember when he did [blackface?](https://youtu.be/SoskEkW5lKA?t=10s)
5861,2020-08-11 05:17:25,i7dwjy,you're not wrong at all
5862,2020-08-11 08:40:48,i7dwjy,Yeah at first I thought it was Shane when someone sent me that clip. Cringe
5863,2020-08-11 00:07:29,i7dwjy,OK but Imagine how sucky it must be to have gotten a Sharon Needles tattoo. LMFAO if anyone ever thinks of getting a tattoo of someone they don’t personally know I’ma just tell them this
5864,2020-08-10 22:55:50,i7dwjy,What a dumbass
5865,2020-08-11 00:40:26,i7dwjy,"Did she admit her past mistakes? I didn't catch that part. Feel free to drop a link! I dont want to ASSUME she learned her lesson when she CLEARLY is fixing her mouth to try to control what comes out of BLACK PEOPLES MOUTHS! Like wtf? Really, wtf?"
5866,2020-08-11 00:37:17,i7dwjy,"I agree. I’m not saying that she’s like a horrible person or whatever, probably just ignorant. But like you said her blocking people and not apologizing (at least that I’ve seen) isn’t her owning up to her past"
5867,2020-08-10 22:56:32,i7dwjy,🥺🥺🥺😻😻😻
5868,2020-08-10 23:34:37,i7dwjy,Bottoms sweetie I'm so sorry
5869,2020-08-10 22:45:41,i7dwjy,"Perez got it from her most likely, she’s Raja’s daughter."
5870,2020-08-10 22:52:51,i7dwjy,Well there you go! Not surprised at all
5871,2020-08-11 00:50:43,i7dwjy,I just found out about that and the other crap he did and said recently and I was so pissed. I used to really like him and I am kind of embarrassed that I ever did now.
5872,2020-08-10 23:27:29,i7dwjy,Willam still fetishizes black men we really shouldn't be surprised
5873,2020-08-11 02:58:00,i7dwjy,I never knew this! I just watched the clip that u/its-very-that replied with and... Wow. I’ve never seen this movie (skit?) before. Was this popular?
5874,2020-08-11 13:35:13,i7dwjy,This is like a straight up minstrel performance. Like the use of blackface to specifically belittle Black people. Like Shane Dawson level. I don't think we should trust anyone who ever felt it was ok to make content like this.
5875,2020-08-11 01:11:26,i7dwjy,YIKES
5876,2020-08-11 03:01:35,i7dwjy,the way my whole face just was so tight waiting for the reveal of her face
5877,2020-08-11 03:24:24,i7dwjy,I can never not read this as drag candidate Kim Chi
5878,2020-08-11 00:46:00,i7dwjy,"I did not say that she said or did that. I only said that we should be willing to accept people's genuine remorse, if they show it, even though they may have used problematic language or made mistakes in the past. However, she is definitely not doing that and deserves to be called out for it.

It is important to be able to forgive, not to mention that we only forgive people who do something wrong (again, speaking generally, as she has not yet owned up to her faults)."
5879,2020-08-11 00:49:37,i7dwjy,"Yeah, I just hope she will see the error of her ways instead of doubling down, as people tend to do when they have been caught on record saying something offensive – not holding my breath that this will happen though."
5880,2020-08-10 23:33:44,i7dwjy,Is she actually Rajas daughter? I thought she just came up under her in the LA scene
5881,2020-08-11 00:10:35,i7dwjy,I thought she was Mayhem Miller’s daughter? Or did they collab on this one?
5882,2020-08-11 11:50:22,i7dwjy,ohhh i see! didnt know that
5883,2020-08-11 05:22:22,i7dwjy,"I was just about to say this!!! My friend, a black man, felt like Willam put him on display during ATL pride two years ago, when Willam said “if he doesn’t get laid during pride, he’s obviously doing something wrong.” Nearly every white twink mobbed him afterwards, and it made him very uncomfortable. ATL is very known for its “preferences,” and my friend walked out afterward the event and said he no longer was a fan of her."
5884,2020-08-11 00:50:51,i7dwjy,"I'd like to know why it was brought up. Like, why are we having forgiveness just waiting on deck for racist people? Who haven't done a single thing to make any amount of amends at all. She is not showing remorse for being a racist. Shes doubling down by telling me I cant say the n word. Fuck her seriously. We shouldn't be sitting around waiting for racists to apologize lmao we can forgive them. 


Also, why are we assuming she will show remorse and apologize? She a racist piece if shit and it came to the surface.

Again fuck her."
5885,2020-08-11 05:07:21,i7dwjy,"She was on Hey Qween and talked about relationship with Raja, but I don't remember what exactly she said and am not bothered enough to go watch"
5886,2020-08-11 01:03:39,i7dwjy,"she could be both Raja and Mayhem’s. i remember when i was looking up the drag families of the show i saw that she had two mothers from the show, i just can’t remember if she’s Mayhem’s or Morgan’s (maybe Willam’s ??) because she’s close with all of them. Raja is for sure one of her mothers though."
5887,2020-08-11 00:56:28,i7dwjy,"I am not assuming that, nor am I condoning her behaviour in any way, if you read what I say. I am only saying that we only mend fences with those who have hurt us. And again, *only* if they show that they are truly sorry, which does not seem to be the case here.

""Fuck her"" is fully justified, but the increased polarisation will be the end of us all, if there can be no hope of coming together at some point."
5888,2020-08-11 01:24:06,i7dwjy,"I want to say it’s Mayhem because Showgirls called them a mother/daughter duo IIRC. But Morgan also works there so who knows.

Definitely not Willam’s I’m sure. Willam doesn’t necessarily have a “drag family” but I could be wrong about that.

Find it weird that someone like Raja be Rhea’s drag mother, since their styles are so different."
5889,2020-08-11 11:49:35,i7dwjy,"I just found her Hey Qween interview and skipped through, she says Raja and Mayhem are her drag mothers"
5890,2020-08-11 01:00:05,i7dwjy,I dont mend fences with racists. And it shouldn't be an expectation because shes the same with with a BLM symbol as her pic. BUT she WILL apologize and it WILL BE performative so she is uncanceled by everyone. Fuck her.
5891,2020-08-11 06:06:48,i7dwjy,"Raja has a couple of drag daughters none of which have her style, considering how unique Raja’s style is it's harder to replicate then your cookie-cutter pageant or camp drag. Regardless if you think about the style difference between Dax ExclamationPoint and Violent style is definitely not passed down the drag family line."
5892,2020-08-11 01:06:50,i7dwjy,"I can respect that. But I also want to believe that sometimes some people can change and learn to grow from their mistakes (to be absolutely clear, she has not exhibited any signs of this). That's just me though and no one is obliged to do so if they choose not to."
5893,2020-08-11 01:12:56,i7dwjy,"Keep wanting to believe. That's your right and ""privilege"". I dont have time for racists. They tend to shoot people that look like my husband and sons and daughters and me. Maybe if we ACTUALLY HOLD RACISTS ACCOUNTABLE this time around, they will stop being FUCKING RACISTS! Is it a struggle every day for you not to be a racist (assuming you're not one, I dont know you)? Because it sure the fuck is a struggle every day being black. 


No sympathy and no forgiveness here. Fuck her."
5894,2020-08-11 01:36:43,i7dwjy,"Honestly, if people can never make amends, why should they?

Still, I am NOT condoning her behaviour, as I have stated repeatedly – I am speaking in the abstract about people who may have grown up in a bad environment, but grow to see the light and have love and compassion for their fellow man, despite having made mistakes in the past.

We can't just see everyone as the devil unless we want to make enemies of everyone.

I do not know this struggle personally, I can only empathize based on my experience as a gay man, being marginalised in a different way, as we have been silenced, erased and killed throughout history. Unity and empathy is important if we hope to ever make allies. I will acknowledge probably being privileged to even think that, but I also think that admitting ones privilege should be normalized, in the same way that I can see how I am not privileged.

But yeah, fuck her specifically and we must hold racists in power responsible."
5895,2020-08-11 01:55:04,i7dwjy,"I wasn't aware I have to forgive her in order for her to make amends. I wasnt aware WE have to forgive her in order for her to do the right thing. If she feels bad she should do so whether people forgive her or not. Even while people view her as the devil she should be apologetic IF SHE ACTUALLY FEELS BAD. Otherwise its performative, as stated.


Edit: taking out a section that has nothing to do with this situation. 


During all of the BLM protesting that she ""cares so much"" about, she took her time to CRITIQUE black people and then turn around and show her support for yet another racist. One who also did a performative apology. Fuck her."
5896,2020-08-11 02:07:36,i7dwjy,"It is absolutely true that people who feel remorse should show contrition without the guarantee of forgiveness, as neither you nor anyone else is *obliged* to forgive. I stress that I never stated that you or we have to forgive, even if I do hope that we will be able to unite and heal as a people and a community at some point in the future. That point is sadly far off it seems and anger is justified. 

Stay strong and I am sorry if my meaning was unclear."
5897,2020-08-11 02:34:52,i7dwjy,No issues here. I'm glad we had this back and forth. Its important to show multiple responses to the same issue so people can understand each other more. We were also respectful which doesnt always happen when people are on different sides of serious issues like this. You stay strong as well.

5948,2020-09-05 13:30:07,in10mc,He be lookin that way on the inside too I’ve heard...

He do be lookin strange tho"
5952,2020-09-05 14:51:11,in10mc,I agree. He looks like he came straight out of Area 51
5953,2020-09-05 17:06:42,in10mc,I don't care about his looks. It's his personality that makes him ugly.
5954,2020-09-05 13:28:54,in10mc,"I had to Google him.

I agree that he's a hideous creature. But thats just my preference. Objectively speaking he does have quite nice eyes I suppose.

His face in general disturbs me though. It reminds me of that horror movie ""House of Wax"".

Regardless, idk if this is unpopular but I feel like it's so subjective there's nothing to be argued or debated here."
5955,2020-09-05 15:11:58,in10mc,Bro this subreddit is called UNPOPULAR opinions...
5956,2020-09-05 13:47:03,in10mc,Good thing everyone hates him
5957,2020-09-05 17:36:10,in10mc,I want that much money.
5958,2020-09-05 13:52:33,in10mc,That’s not unpopular
5959,2020-09-05 15:29:35,in10mc,This should be on extremely popular opinions subreddit
5960,2020-09-05 15:05:50,in10mc,"I don't usually drag people for the way they look. He's vile on the inside, so that's all I really need. However, I will also say those expensive track suits are hideous as fuck. 

Tangentially, I never got into that whole Gucci slide thing that Shane et al got into, especially post-meeting Jeffree. Like when Ryland went to the Gucci store...shit's so fucking ugly and WAY overpriced to boot. Just seeing them all flopping around the house unshowered, unkempt, in sweats and robes but also ugly-ass, expensive slides - with socks - made my skin crawl."
5961,2020-09-05 14:22:14,in10mc,Even as another man I totally accept how he looks. You do you if that makes your happy. But his personality is whats so vile.
5962,2020-09-05 15:06:47,in10mc,"agreed, hes an abomination."
5963,2020-09-05 17:21:36,in10mc,I had to google this. Aaaaaaaaand you’re right.
5964,2020-09-05 16:32:05,in10mc,"I mean, idk why someone's appearance bothers you. If he is a a bad person, I can see that as a reason for you to not like him, but his appearance shouldn't be one reason."
5965,2020-09-05 14:38:26,in10mc,no shit
5966,2020-09-05 16:25:43,in10mc,"I can't say I think it looks good, but if you think of the make-up as a form of self-expression or art (which I can get behind) Then I can still respect the look. This is only regarding Jeffree's appearance though, I get the impression that he isn't exactly *liked* by a lot of people. Has he done something specifically fucked up?"
5967,2020-09-05 20:02:19,in10mc,"His personality is ugly, and that's what matters"
5968,2020-09-05 17:55:37,in10mc,Very popular opinion nowadays. Doesn’t help that he has an ugly heart
5969,2020-09-05 15:25:44,in10mc,He is the definition of TRASH.
5970,2020-09-05 16:32:13,in10mc,He looks like a reptile
5971,2020-09-05 16:39:27,in10mc,His personality is trashy but I feel it’s a low blow to ever insult someone on their looks. Who cares what people look like just judge their personalities
5972,2020-09-05 15:49:10,in10mc,I think most of the makeup community is pretty ugly eater on the inside or out.
5973,2020-09-05 14:43:28,in10mc,I don’t know. There’s also Trisha Peytis and plenty of other people who actively make themselves objectively disgusting.
5974,2020-09-05 16:03:41,in10mc,I have to keep down vomit when I see him trending on YouTube. It's one of the reasons I stopped looking at the trending page and stuck with my subscription channels
5975,2020-09-05 15:10:43,in10mc,"Who TF is Jeffree Star? 

One google search later: OH.

Me: I'm getting old I guess."
5976,2020-09-05 15:44:16,in10mc,Ya he ugly as fuck. Also i hate that you introduced to this person.
5977,2020-09-05 15:39:49,in10mc,"I remember having a conversation with a friend who knows a lot about Jeffree star and he said something about that star just wants a non human look, this conversation took place when I asked him about gene editing (as I study bio and genetics) and because of star wanting a non human look, chances are that he’s gonna blow a lot of money on gene editing when it becomes a thing"

5982,2020-09-05 17:54:43,in10mc,Jeffree stars appearance doesn't bother me as much as his unethical business antics and his sleezy personality. I used to be a fan because he seemed truly hard working until he completely ripped off hard working artists.
5983,2020-09-05 18:48:48,in10mc,"Man, I hate when people drag others down about their looks. Like talk about his character, his other negative problems. Looks are not something he can control. He didn’t get to choose his looks. Now his morals and his character have at it."
5984,2020-09-05 18:50:15,in10mc,"I used to think the same but I got over it becaused I realized:

Thats his body and I have mine and we're cool with our bodies."
5985,2020-09-05 20:45:26,in10mc,"I don't mind his appearance, the only issue I have is just *how* many tattoos he has (and I'm a person who loves tattoos.) I like how unique he is, and the fact he doesn't look human.

The ugly part about him is his personality though."
5986,2020-09-05 21:01:17,in10mc,"You shouldn't hate a person for the way they look, but you can hate them for being shi**y people. Jeffree Star is a hateful, racist nazi"
5987,2020-09-05 21:30:57,in10mc,How original. Another Jeffree Star post.
5988,2020-09-05 14:53:01,in10mc,i feel it's not okay to go after people's appearances unless they're vile human beings so yeah i'd say he's pretty scary looking

5994,2020-09-05 21:58:25,in10mc,Can we lump James Charles with him?

6008,2020-09-05 21:36:46,in10mc,I think there is enough to complain about Jeffree Starr without dragging his appearance into this. Why don't you post a pic so we can critique your looks too? Cause right now you seem pretty ugly inside.

Honestly we need to try and squash these feelings about other people. Karma isn’t just something on reddit. When you judge others judgment comes on you tenfold.

Stop body shaming"

6060,2020-09-05 20:18:25,in10mc,He looks like General Grievous.
6061,2020-09-05 20:31:43,in10mc,Kinda like an uglier Marilyn Manson .
6062,2020-09-05 20:32:30,in10mc,"1. It's Youtube. They fucking love people like him.
2. It's the make-up industry. They fucking love people like him.

Gather all those who adore him in the public. I bet it'll look like some weird ass gathering of those -con conventions."
6063,2020-09-05 20:35:24,in10mc,Don’t you guys miss the days when Marilyn Manson was the weirdest looking person around?
6064,2020-09-05 20:37:57,in10mc,This post made me google jefree star and my conclusion is he looks exactly like if marilyn manson became a brony
6065,2020-09-05 20:38:16,in10mc,"""Heyyyyy sisters........""  :D"
6066,2020-09-05 20:42:19,in10mc,"Lord Voldemort, irl."
6067,2020-09-05 20:45:17,in10mc,I do think his resemblance to the Crypt Keeper is uncanny
6068,2020-09-05 20:46:42,in10mc,This isn't too unpopular
6069,2020-09-05 21:00:29,in10mc,Dunking on someone's appearance has to be the lowest form of criticism. Who cares what anyone looks like? Jeffree Star is simply a trash human being.
6070,2020-09-05 21:04:54,in10mc,He's also a trash human being.
6071,2020-09-05 21:06:20,in10mc,There is another...
6072,2020-09-05 21:06:25,in10mc,Based
6073,2020-09-05 21:07:49,in10mc,"Yup, fucking freak"
6074,2020-09-05 21:10:13,in10mc,"Nosferatu grudge fucked a time traveling ancient Eqyptian and their baby was stuck here, in our time, unfortunately."
6075,2020-09-05 21:16:48,in10mc,More like Jeffery dahmer
6076,2020-09-05 21:18:04,in10mc,Dude looks like a child molester
6077,2020-09-05 21:19:35,in10mc,He/she identifies as a Dali painting.
6078,2020-09-05 21:19:50,in10mc,"Not unpopular, she/he/it looks like a lizard fucked a human"
6079,2020-09-05 21:30:26,in10mc,"#James Charles and Shane Dawson are right up there with him for ugliest creatures on the planet, they all reek of pedophilia tells too."
6080,2020-09-05 21:37:03,in10mc,He's part of the lizard elite.
6081,2020-09-05 21:39:13,in10mc,How is this an unpopular opinion
6082,2020-09-05 21:42:02,in10mc,Absolutely. Not far behind him is James Charles but Jeffree is definitely ahead with the ugliness.
6083,2020-09-05 21:43:22,in10mc,18k updoots.
6084,2020-09-05 21:48:24,in10mc,And he’s a piece of shit as well
6085,2020-09-05 21:49:01,in10mc,He looks like lord voldemort 😂😂🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️
6086,2020-09-05 21:49:40,in10mc,"I don't think this is unpopular. Only his ""fans"" are delusional themselves and fall into the same category. The man is mentally ill, an alien, a freakshow, and shouldn't be influencing anyone."
6087,2020-09-05 22:32:40,in10mc,He is the most disgusting person alive. (Physically)
6088,2020-09-05 22:33:27,in10mc,"Defo not an unpopular opinion, hes vile 🤢"
6089,2020-09-05 22:34:49,in10mc,He’s literally been exposed for talking to little kids and trying to hookup. Men who dress like this are pedos
6090,2020-09-05 22:43:52,in10mc,"He's also a hypocrite. He likes to call out Huda for stealing when he stole the lip bullets and the cremated pallet. 

Here's my proof for the 13 year olds who are gonna down vote just because he's a man who wears make up and how dare I? 
https://youtu.be/XJbUuAeN8xk

It is a video about alternatives to his make up but this person acknowledges things he stole from some of these companies."
6091,2020-09-05 22:44:19,in10mc,"He’s more ugly on the inside than out, which is saying something"
6092,2020-09-05 22:45:25,in10mc,"I never heard about him until now.

&#x200B;

Gee, thanks."
6093,2020-09-05 22:47:59,in10mc,🤡
6094,2020-09-05 22:51:30,in10mc,His is disturbing in every way
6095,2020-09-05 22:52:13,in10mc,Inside and out. Just a gross human being.
6096,2020-09-05 22:52:59,in10mc,I will never be able to express the distaste I have for Jeffree Star.
6097,2020-09-05 23:00:33,in10mc,Racist piece of shit too
6098,2020-09-05 23:07:35,in10mc,Jeffree star fans are shaking rn
6099,2020-09-05 23:08:30,in10mc,"He looks like an evil Lurch who couldn’t accept reality, tried a makeover and then decided to do drag. None of it works. Absolutely zero taste or intelligence in something trying to pass for a human."
6100,2020-09-05 23:26:46,in10mc,unpopular opinion but I think murder is wrong.
6101,2020-09-05 23:31:00,in10mc,Not uglier than trump. Figuratively and literally.
6102,2020-09-05 23:34:33,in10mc,"I’m not gonna defend someone who is a horrible person, but I am going to ask why you spend so much energy hating someone you don’t even know? You sound really pissed off, lol."
6103,2020-09-05 23:42:55,in10mc,"I mean that ridiculous overdone look in general is gross. The Kardashians are gross. The Jenners are gross. In terms of physical attraction, people who are overdone like that are incredibly unattractive to me.

That said, if enough people are into it and they can make a living off of it, I can't hate the hustle."
6104,2020-09-05 23:48:15,in10mc,"Look, I don’t like the guy. As far as I’ve heard (with zero personal research involved) he’s a piece of shit. At the same time, I can’t help but respect anyone willing to go so hard against the grain of society’s idea of “the way we should look;” in addition to that, I think it’s really good that, like him or not, he’s a mainstream figure representing the androgynous community, and demonstrating that you can be different and successful. I know this is r/unpopularopinion and I respect yours, just felt the need to speak my mind on this. In conclusion, yeah fuck that dude"
6105,2020-09-05 23:59:37,in10mc,"i think this is just plain sexism. i don’t support jeffree due to his past behavior, but if we’re just talking about looks jeffree’s regular makeup isn’t much different from traditional beauty guru makeup."
6106,2020-09-06 00:21:10,in10mc,"I served him and his mother I believe at my bar, they were super nice and really liked my margaritas 
Not my style personally but they were super chill"
6107,2020-09-06 00:30:10,in10mc,This isn’t an unpopular opinion
6108,2020-09-06 01:11:41,in10mc,And also Bella Thorne looks like a failed clone of him or something idk
6109,2020-09-06 02:12:52,in10mc,I personally think he kinda looks cool but im attracted to clowns so- 👀
6110,2020-09-06 02:23:04,in10mc,"I think he looks good in some way, interesting to look at at least."
6111,2020-09-06 03:04:04,in10mc,"Sorry, I think Post Malone is uglier"
6112,2020-09-06 03:04:41,in10mc,He still be rich tho.
6113,2020-09-06 03:06:33,in10mc,Chill
6114,2020-09-06 03:15:05,in10mc,He got you talking about him didnt he?
6115,2020-09-06 04:53:21,in10mc,his makeup is good though tbh
6116,2020-09-06 04:56:40,in10mc,Has anyone seen my flamethrower?
6117,2020-09-06 05:21:54,in10mc,For a second I thought you meant Patrick Star and we about to have problems. Carry on.
6118,2020-09-06 07:37:57,in10mc,He looks like one of the villains/creatures off Courage the Cowardly Dog. You know which one I mean.
6119,2020-09-06 09:05:04,in10mc,Like I understand beauty is in the eye of the beholder. But holy shite is he weird. I’m genuinely curious how he still has a following.
6120,2020-09-06 14:34:53,in10mc,"Meatcanyon got Jeffree star 100% in his parody animation 
Along with Shane"
6121,2020-09-06 16:19:59,in10mc,r/instagramreality
6122,2020-09-06 20:00:18,in10mc,There's something very unlikable about him.
6123,2020-09-27 03:00:01,in10mc,Jfc...I wish you ppl would stop doing this to me. I am naturally curious and will Google things that ppl post and now I've just googled this ugly fuck and now I can't unsee it!!!
6124,2020-10-03 20:36:59,in10mc,He got some cool tats tho
6125,2020-09-05 19:17:47,in10mc,"what does it for me is the hypocrisy of his fanbase; it's made up of those pseudo-socialist ""eat the rich"" types, but will wank Jeffree off online with with bloated YAAAS QUEEN😍😍😍 types of comments."
6126,2020-09-05 18:24:56,in10mc,"Ok so I just looked him up cause I’ve never heard of him before. And I have some questions. Sorry if these are rude questions, I just truly don’t know. 

Is he really into drag? Is he trans? Something else? I just don’t understand why anyone (regardless of gender by the way, not being sexist) would choose to look like... that. You’re 100% right OP, Jeffrey Star is in fact the ugliest creature on the planet."
6127,2020-09-05 15:21:31,in10mc,"Agreed. Love your lack of transphobic language, thank you for demonstrating that you can hate an individual without making horrid generalizations."
6128,2020-09-05 15:18:41,in10mc,Fr fr
6129,2020-09-05 16:01:28,in10mc,He gives me major Voldemort vibes
6130,2020-09-05 16:08:40,in10mc,Had to google search who that was.....thanks for the nightmares tonight.
6131,2020-09-05 16:17:50,in10mc,You mean Jafar starfish
6132,2020-09-05 17:39:42,in10mc,I was happier before I googled that name
6133,2020-09-05 17:54:58,in10mc,[deleted]
6134,2020-09-05 20:35:17,in10mc,He looks like poorly made sex doll.
6135,2020-09-05 17:57:16,in10mc,[removed]
6136,2020-09-05 15:37:56,in10mc,He’s a horrible person on the inside too. He literally tried to make a nazi makeup like once and has continued to show his racist and classist colors again and again. Ugly inside and out.
6137,2020-09-05 16:31:42,in10mc,Consider the world overall where shit like this is allowed to get popular. Everything is 24/7 trash with zero dignity anymore.
6138,2020-09-05 16:45:01,in10mc,He looks like a horse
6139,2020-09-05 18:17:04,in10mc,"Finally

An unpopular opinion we all can agree on"
6140,2020-09-05 18:19:36,in10mc,"I want to see u/jeffreestar react to this. 

Idk who owns that account or if it even exists I’m just tagging it to see what happens..."
6141,2020-09-05 18:26:24,in10mc,This actually very popular of an opinion
6142,2020-09-05 21:37:36,in10mc,All these dudes that coat their faces in make up look creepy and ugly to me.
6143,2020-09-06 02:54:27,in10mc,Oh I thought TRUMP was holding that title quite tightly! 🤣
6144,2020-09-06 05:35:57,in10mc,He's a piece of trash
6145,2020-09-06 06:04:05,in10mc,"i didn’t know this was an unpopular opinion, i thought everyone knew this but just didn’t say anything because we all knew..."
6146,2020-09-06 06:41:27,in10mc,People in the beauty community aren’t even beautiful when it comes to physical appearance or personality
6147,2020-09-05 21:39:17,in10mc,"The people are forced to say he's beautiful, otherwise they'd be called out being homophobic and full of hate and jealousy"
6148,2020-09-06 01:39:18,in10mc,"Popular or unpopular, it definitely makes you a dick to post this."
6149,2020-09-05 14:46:00,in10mc,Same.
6150,2020-09-05 15:18:07,in10mc,CORROECT!
6151,2020-09-05 15:30:11,in10mc,"I 100% agree the first time I saw there face, I actually got a bit scared lol. He is also pretty bad on the inside too"
6152,2020-09-05 16:26:38,in10mc,"Had to google it because I had no idea who he was. Wow, what a train wreck!"
6153,2020-09-05 16:30:43,in10mc,"The reason people say hes beautiful is because hes a major voice of the LGBT community and popular. I personally dont like the way he looks, but I don't know enough about him to decide if I'd like him. Him not being physically attractive to me isnt enough for me to not like him (but I dont like his content, not a make up fan)"
6154,2020-09-05 16:33:11,in10mc,That's not an unpopular opinion. Nobody that looks at that face actually thinks it's aesthetically pleasing. You're just not allowed to say it out loud for fear of being called a bigot or something.
6155,2020-09-05 16:34:37,in10mc,The first time I saw him I thought he was a fucking alien
6156,2020-09-05 16:35:34,in10mc,I envy his cheekbones
6157,2020-09-05 16:38:21,in10mc,"His videos are still getting millions of views, literally overnight.  All of his makeup sells out and it is not cheap.  He is problematic and he fucking knows it. It hasn't stopped his coin"
6158,2020-09-05 16:44:15,in10mc,I just find him a morally repulsive person🤷‍♂️
6159,2020-09-05 16:51:12,in10mc,"I do often wonder how he makes money as a beauty guru, I find his appearance frightening."
6160,2020-09-05 16:54:10,in10mc,sebastion bales. you forgot about him
6161,2020-09-05 16:54:25,in10mc,He’s a fucking demon
6162,2020-09-05 16:57:44,in10mc,He reminds me of one of those freaks in the capitol in the hunger games
6163,2020-09-05 17:07:06,in10mc,He is nightmare fuel
6164,2020-09-05 17:07:25,in10mc,He reminds me of the alien from American Dad. Personality and all.
6165,2020-09-05 17:11:53,in10mc,Who?
6166,2020-09-05 17:18:09,in10mc,"I could have gone my whole life without finding out about this person.

After seeing him this must be very popular."
6167,2020-09-05 17:19:20,in10mc,"Yeah, he's fucking clapped."
6168,2020-09-05 17:24:52,in10mc,He deadass looks like Spiderus Reeves
6169,2020-09-05 17:29:28,in10mc,"All his looks are cheap and trashy. Does not matter how many Birkins and designer logo stuff he gets, you cannot buy class or style."
6170,2020-09-05 17:30:57,in10mc,Is this really not a popular opinion?
6171,2020-09-05 17:31:40,in10mc,[deleted]
6172,2020-09-05 17:32:31,in10mc,Why doesn’t he have eyebrows?
6173,2020-09-05 17:32:53,in10mc,"Ugh , very popular. 
However its the inside thats uglier."
6174,2020-09-05 17:33:15,in10mc,Downvoted because this is an extremely popular opinion.
6175,2020-09-05 17:34:19,in10mc,"So, most runway models are the ugliest creatures on the planet then?

They all look like him."
6176,2020-09-05 17:34:28,in10mc,found the enemy stand user
6177,2020-09-05 17:34:32,in10mc,"James Charles, is that you?"
6178,2020-09-05 17:35:37,in10mc,Which does NOT apply to all drag queens or anything like that. Jeffree is a despicable human and his look reflects that. You can just tell.
6179,2020-09-05 17:39:24,in10mc,His confidence is 99% of what people find attractive
6180,2020-09-05 17:41:43,in10mc,You should check out Meat Canyon on YouTube who did a satirical video on him and other members of the cosmetic YouTube. The guy is as ugly inside as he is out. Here's the link: https://youtu.be/7T9yMSNG1iQ
6181,2020-09-05 17:44:17,in10mc,"Up our for potentially unpopular opinion. From what I know of him, he seems like a horrible person. But even I'll admit that he's objectively attractive, even tho I don't like the androgynous look."
6182,2020-09-05 17:44:27,in10mc,THANK GOD SOMEBODY SAID IT THAT GUY LOOKS LIKE A FUCKING FREAK
6183,2020-09-05 17:45:54,in10mc,He is also a racist piece of shit.
6184,2020-09-05 17:47:33,in10mc,And that’s before we get into their personality ..
6185,2020-09-05 17:47:41,in10mc,him and James Charles are disgusting
6186,2020-09-05 17:48:01,in10mc,I often can’t tell if I’m looking at a boy or a girl so I’ll go with “it”. It looks like a freaking zombie!
6187,2020-09-05 17:48:03,in10mc,I get what you are going for but have you seen Tess Holiday.
6188,2020-09-05 17:48:04,in10mc,"Oh don't you worry, the kunt is uglier on the inside and that's saying something."
6189,2020-09-05 17:50:10,in10mc,I don't really care for his look. There is a guy i watch on tik tok who just does makeup so much better.
6190,2020-09-05 17:51:30,in10mc,You’ve clearly never had dinner with me.
6191,2020-09-05 17:51:57,in10mc,I used to watch him but no more with all the drama that has transpired. I Just want to watch make up tutorials
6192,2020-09-05 17:52:13,in10mc,Look up Patrick starrrrr. Much worse.
6193,2020-09-05 17:52:58,in10mc,He’s ugly inside and out!! He’s always caught in some kinda drama within the YT beauty community
6194,2020-09-05 17:55:06,in10mc,I had to look him up too. Doesn’t that added to the most ‘frequently searched’ results on goggle? Great way to work the system!
6195,2020-09-05 17:59:54,in10mc,Hold my beer.
6196,2020-09-05 18:01:45,in10mc,I still can believe this guy is still famous from being an internet star since before like 2002 on Melodramtic. One of the first social media platforms. Fucking weird.
6197,2020-09-05 18:01:57,in10mc,"I had no idea who this person was until I saw this post. So I googled Jeffree Star.

How is this an unpopular opinion?"
6198,2020-09-05 18:03:03,in10mc,Without makeup he looks like a 30 year old Millie Bobby Brown with a crack addiction and with makeup he looks like an alien from Zorgon 9
6199,2020-09-05 18:04:45,in10mc,I just looks like a somewhat normal person without makeup.
6200,2020-09-05 18:04:48,in10mc,Yeah that’s one ugly dude
6201,2020-09-05 18:05:43,in10mc,And he’s still making $40 mil a year last I heard. Holy fuck people are stupid.
6202,2020-09-05 18:07:40,in10mc,he looks like  👽
6203,2020-09-05 18:07:42,in10mc,"I didn't think you meant jeffree with makeup at all. He looks like a elderly vampire without makeup. He looks more human WITH 14 tons of crap on his face. Freaking goblin either way.

Also, can we appreciate that this country has a famous drag queen named Jeff??"
6204,2020-09-05 18:07:49,in10mc,thank you
6205,2020-09-05 18:09:47,in10mc,Who's Jeffree Star?
6206,2020-09-05 18:09:54,in10mc,This is my first time seeing that person but how this is an unpopular opinion.
6207,2020-09-05 18:09:58,in10mc,"Thank you! When I see this tool in my YT trending page, it gives me nightmares"
6208,2020-09-05 18:12:29,in10mc,"It’s not his appearance that disgusts me. I don’t stoop so low as to ridicule people for the way they look, that means nothing to me. His personality, though, very VERY ugly."
6209,2020-09-05 18:12:45,in10mc,"my god, YES.

I can't look at him without a cringe"

6211,2020-09-05 18:15:31,in10mc,He?!?? Did you just pronounce his pronouns?!?! I think you mean to say DEAMON
6212,2020-09-05 18:16:18,in10mc,Still probably gets more loving than reddit
6213,2020-09-05 18:16:44,in10mc,"You’ve clearly never seen the Bogdanoff Brothers, but yeah Jeffrey doesn’t look juman either. This isn’t unpopular tho."
6214,2020-09-05 18:18:37,in10mc,Wrong subreddit. I must downvote because I agree.
6215,2020-09-05 18:19:14,in10mc,lmao
6216,2020-09-05 18:20:58,in10mc,Honest to god have never heard this name and I refuse to Google him. 😂
6217,2020-09-05 18:21:00,in10mc,Had to google. Looks extraordinarily ugly.
6218,2020-09-05 18:22:14,in10mc,It's considered woke to claim someone extremely ugly is beautiful. The more you unashamedly deny reality the more woke you are.
6219,2020-09-05 18:22:46,in10mc,You'd love the Meat Canyon parody of him.
6220,2020-09-05 18:23:00,in10mc,An eyebrowless freak with racist and misogynistic tendencies.  There's a lot of ugly inside and out.
6221,2020-09-05 18:23:25,in10mc,He’s kind of like a Chihuahua in my opinion people say they are so ugly that they are cute
6222,2020-09-05 18:23:31,in10mc,"I know it’s not cool to compare real life to fiction, hell I’m subbed to r/readanotherbook but fucking hell he looks like Voldemort"
6223,2020-09-05 18:25:18,in10mc,Looks like an alien. Probably not from this planet
6224,2020-09-05 18:25:30,in10mc,If a skeleton and slenderman had a child it would be Jeffrey star
6225,2020-09-05 18:26:26,in10mc,[https://youtu.be/7T9yMSNG1iQ?t=17](https://youtu.be/7T9yMSNG1iQ?t=17)
6226,2020-09-05 18:26:49,in10mc,"Ok after googling about him (his images), I do agree with you. It may seem hypocritical as I myself being ugly am sure that jeffree star is one of the most ugliest person I have ever seen. Maybe it could by my bias towards dislike of unnatural hair color (highlighting is ok but changing one's hair colour, especially something unnatural is not my cup of tea, maybe some exceptions), but even his face is unpleasant to look at.  Seriously he is uglier than the ugliest guy I have ever met. His makeup is horrible to look at and neither he have good feminine features. Sorry if anyone gets offended but this is my opinion."
6227,2020-09-05 18:28:56,in10mc,"Dunno who that even is, and honestly could not care less...  Moving on."
6228,2020-09-05 18:29:19,in10mc,This is a popular opinion by people with eyes.
6229,2020-09-05 18:29:57,in10mc,I had no idea who he is. Now I regret knowing. Thanks for nothing OP.
6230,2020-09-05 18:30:33,in10mc,Ngl at one point in time I thought he was the actor for voldemort
6231,2020-09-05 18:30:54,in10mc,How dare you talk about michael jackson that way
6232,2020-09-05 18:30:55,in10mc,Can someone explain why he’s vile? I’ve known about him since the MySpace days but I didn’t know he was a bad person.
6233,2020-09-05 18:31:25,in10mc,Who TF is Jeffree Star?
6234,2020-09-05 18:32:58,in10mc,i just googled him and he looks ugly as fuck wtf
6235,2020-09-05 18:34:01,in10mc,Amen to this
6236,2020-09-05 18:34:10,in10mc,He's always like 👁 👄 👁
6237,2020-09-05 18:34:20,in10mc,"And why do people still support him? He’s a terrible person! I get he has a good makeup line, but he himself is a gross person"
6238,2020-09-05 18:34:28,in10mc,I agree. At least James Charles doesn’t look like a fucking alien.
6239,2020-09-05 18:35:29,in10mc,Just googled it. Yes.
6240,2020-09-05 18:35:38,in10mc,Fuck that racist ass bitch and whatever he stands for.  Trash
6241,2020-09-05 18:36:01,in10mc,"I feel bad for dudes that can pull off the female look, it’s a hard life I imagine. Doesn’t excuse rudeness though"
6242,2020-09-05 18:36:11,in10mc,"If I’m being unbiased in judging Jeffree Star’s appearance (not factoring in his shady, selfish, greedy, racist personality), I can respect the fact that his look is extremely unique. He knows he looks weird, and he often calls himself an alien/Voldemort. And although he wears a ton of makeup, he’s objectively talented. Again, he is a POS human being, but I can’t fault him for looking unique with no shame."
6243,2020-09-05 18:36:56,in10mc,He’s definitely someone’s sleep paralysis demon
6244,2020-09-05 18:36:59,in10mc,"Welcome to 2020 where people like him are considered beautiful, brave and whatnot. Degenerates like him along with the praise from others is what drives other people to turn into freaks like Jeffree, who I just heard about from reading your post."
6245,2020-09-05 18:38:05,in10mc,"I'm usually not behind insulting people's appearance, but he actively chooses to look like this, so I think this is valid criticism"
6246,2020-09-05 18:38:32,in10mc,He has a banging car collection
6247,2020-09-05 18:38:42,in10mc,Followed closely by James Charles
6248,2020-09-05 18:39:35,in10mc,Voldemort lookin headass
6249,2020-09-05 18:39:41,in10mc,I really didint think he looked bad
6250,2020-09-05 18:41:04,in10mc,I pay no attention to this jeffree guy but everyone’s saying he’s racist horrible person. can someone explain how or like what he did
6251,2020-09-05 18:41:28,in10mc,He is an insult to everything
6252,2020-09-05 18:41:45,in10mc,"I mean, he could draw his eyebrows in and maybe gain a few pounds and I’d think he was fine but that’s just my personal opinion"
6253,2020-09-05 18:41:47,in10mc,if took me untill now to realize he's a dude
6254,2020-09-05 18:42:03,in10mc,"He looks like a demon, and his makeup is just tacky and overpriced. I can't believe people actually waste money on his products. Not to mention, he's a rotten person"
6255,2020-09-05 18:42:16,in10mc,It’s a mental illness
6256,2020-09-05 18:42:22,in10mc,"I think a lot of his fans enjoy him for his makeup. Obviously his look isn’t an every day look, but it’s more of an form of art. So when they call him beautiful I think they mean his makeup. Fashion is pretty subjective so I guess some people find it to be. 🤷🏻‍♂️ 

I am not a fan of him or makeup so I’m right there with you. Lol."
6257,2020-09-05 18:42:23,in10mc,It's like he goes for the drag queen demon look. He looks creepy as fuck.
6258,2020-09-05 18:42:31,in10mc,I'm not a fan of his looks too. I feel the whole point of make up is to cover up slight flaws or to put more attention on a shining feature. When you do that to your whole face that says a few things. You are really flawed or you are really conceded. Middle grounds exist but not for him in this case.
6259,2020-09-05 18:42:32,in10mc,"Ngl just did a quick google search, mans looks like a alien."
6260,2020-09-05 18:42:56,in10mc,He also sounds like the dean from community
6261,2020-09-05 18:43:07,in10mc,He’s fucking creepy. He’s like a skeleton from a horror movie.
6262,2020-09-05 18:43:34,in10mc,Same thing but basically about every drag queen
6263,2020-09-05 18:43:44,in10mc,100000% agree. Looks like a fucking gremlin elf ET mofo. I despise it's looks and wish it was never on YouTube. Alas I can't do anything and have to bear existing the same time as it.
6264,2020-09-05 18:44:10,in10mc,I thought Jeffree was a woman '_'
6265,2020-09-05 18:44:12,in10mc,I was so surprised at how big of a following and how much damn money he’s made. I thought it was Marilyn Manson first.
6266,2020-09-05 18:44:32,in10mc,"I mean, James Charles, I can see. Decent amount of make-up, not too much cosmetic surgery. Jeffree Star is fuckin terrifying."
6267,2020-09-05 18:44:58,in10mc,"i think he’s a sorry excuse for human being but i think judging ppl for how they look makes u look bad as well, even if that person is jeffree star"
6268,2020-09-05 18:45:04,in10mc,"He looks grotesque. And he spells his name in a really wanky way, too."
6269,2020-09-05 18:45:38,in10mc,have you seen ed sheeran
6270,2020-09-05 18:45:43,in10mc,Can't agree more with this statement
6271,2020-09-05 18:46:28,in10mc,"Bro YES, how that thing sells beauty products and has a career off of it is beyond me. We live in lunacy."
6272,2020-09-05 18:46:31,in10mc,"Had to google him.

But how on earth he has so many followers ? Is he some sort of Youtube Celebrity in US  ?"
6273,2020-09-05 18:47:44,in10mc,I have an occult theory that he's not human
6274,2020-09-05 18:48:53,in10mc,He is a weird man isn’t he
6275,2020-09-05 18:50:43,in10mc,Lmao not to defend Jeffree but I see this reposted here every once in a while and it always gets blown up like this. Proof of concept.
6276,2020-09-05 18:51:18,in10mc,Not a unpopular opinion
6277,2020-09-05 18:51:39,in10mc,"He looks like a corpse that is controlled by somebody.
Pale and skinny."
6278,2020-09-05 18:52:27,in10mc,I didn't know who he was until I saw this post and searched him up and now I wonder why anyone or anything would give birth to it and then keep it
6279,2020-09-05 18:52:35,in10mc,"Yas Queen Yas Queen YAS QUEEN YAS QUEEN **YAS QUEEN YAS QUEEN**

6280,2020-09-05 18:52:39,in10mc,Im not even watching Jeffree and I barely even know it but why do I feel offended lmaoo
6281,2020-09-05 18:52:57,in10mc,Thanks you made me Google him and now I hate today.
6282,2020-09-05 18:55:56,in10mc,He looks like “afghan hounds”
6283,2020-09-05 18:56:35,in10mc,There’s nothing appealing about Jeffree Starr inside and out.
6284,2020-09-05 18:56:48,in10mc,"I have the same thoughts about all those male influencers in make up like Jeffrey Star, James Charles, etc. They all look like freaks"
6285,2020-09-05 18:57:38,in10mc,popular opinion
6286,2020-09-05 18:57:53,in10mc,Nah he has a fat ass tho 😂 I agree but loooool
6287,2020-09-05 18:58:30,in10mc,"The only thing I like is his money to be honest, and his house."
6288,2020-09-05 18:59:22,in10mc,"The word ugly is not enough to describe the abomination. 

He is an appalling waste of space."
6289,2020-09-05 18:59:27,in10mc,"Yeah his existence makes me wildly uncomfortable. Not even just for his looks, his whole vibe got me fucked up."
6290,2020-09-05 19:00:00,in10mc,Go watch the meatcanyon video of Jeffree Star. Itll be the only way you see him from now on.
6291,2020-09-05 19:00:56,in10mc,"I googled that... Thing? I guess it's a thing, or an animal, definitely not a person. Anyway, I regret seeing this something. Need some eyebleach for certain."
6292,2020-09-05 19:01:12,in10mc,"the thing you’re looking for to describe him, is general grievous"
6293,2020-09-05 19:01:20,in10mc,He's gotta be on meth or coke.
6294,2020-09-05 19:02:46,in10mc,"Didn’t know who he was, looked up pictures and first thing I thought of was voldemort"
6295,2020-09-05 19:02:49,in10mc,Quite a popular opinion ngl
6296,2020-09-05 19:04:27,in10mc,Is it popular opinion that he's not ugly?
6297,2020-09-05 19:04:34,in10mc,"One night when my friend was staying over she was watching his make-up tutorial/reviews, I actually sat up in bed and requested a change until I fell asleep. What a wretch of a person."
6298,2020-09-05 19:04:57,in10mc,Why did you make me google him?

6301,2020-09-05 19:07:07,in10mc,Had to Google what a Jeffre star is. Fuckjng repulsive
6302,2020-09-05 19:07:59,in10mc,I wanted to say this but I was afraid that reddit will kill me with hive mind
6303,2020-09-05 19:08:44,in10mc,Why didn't you include a picture?
6304,2020-09-05 19:09:03,in10mc,"Drag can be fun sometimes, but if it's your normal getup it's both distracting and (to me) repulsive. So over the top and imo just shouldn't happen outside of performances, at least at the levels that he does it"

6309,2020-09-05 19:11:19,in10mc,Ugly people generally try to cover it
6310,2020-09-05 19:11:32,in10mc,I personally think people support him just so they can virtue signal
6311,2020-09-05 19:11:40,in10mc,He looks like an alien. I honestly expect him to wear blackout contacts
6312,2020-09-05 19:11:45,in10mc,This is a popular opinion.
6313,2020-09-05 19:11:51,in10mc,He looks like skeletor with make up on

That mf look like the bar in the closet you hang your clothes on did crack cocaine and heroine. You know how some people and are genuine they say all life should be appreciated? Jeffery is that one person that’s excluded. How you racist ugly and uneducated. If I was gay I’d go straight just so I wouldn’t be in the same group as him. Speaking of Mf gives the gay community a bad rep. How you culture appropriate and steal from people that you mock and disrespect. And too all those females who still support him or condone his actions. Fuck y’all two Nike Boot face ass hoes.
6337,2020-09-05 19:27:52,in10mc,"He looks like Marylin Manson if Marylin Manson did too much crack . Plus like most people in his “field”, he’s just a disgusting fake person"

6362,2020-09-05 19:43:43,in10mc,He looks like the type of person to freak out and call a bunch of people predators and child molesters  to get people to buy his stuff and then say “I said those things in a dark place in my life.”
6363,2020-09-05 19:43:44,in10mc,He's looks like a meth addict dipped in glitter

6370,2020-09-05 19:48:25,in10mc,"I wouldn’t go so far to say he’s the ugliest person I’ve ever seen. He’s out there, no doubt, but there’s some fugly muthas out there.

I can’t speak, however, to whether or not he’s a shitty person. I’d never heard of him until just now, and I have no interest in learning more."
6371,2020-09-05 19:48:35,in10mc,"He looks really fuckin weird, but my gf loves his makeup"
6372,2020-09-05 19:48:36,in10mc,"It’s hilarious to me how you refer to him as creature, but yeah fax"
6373,2020-09-05 19:48:59,in10mc,"He’s ugly on the inside, and on the outside."
6374,2020-09-05 19:49:38,in10mc,i forgot what he looked like so i googled him and now im gonna go bleach my eyes
6375,2020-09-05 19:50:19,in10mc,To me he looks like a skeleton in a wig. His eyes and cheekbones are so sunken in. His full tattooed body is just too over the top
6376,2020-09-05 19:51:05,in10mc,"I have never seen a statement more FACTUALLY incorrect in my life, you sub-human degenerate.

Tell, HOW THE FUCK can Jeffree Star be the ""ugliest creature on the planet"" when I live here too?"
6377,2020-09-05 19:51:41,in10mc,Finally someone said it!
6378,2020-09-05 19:52:40,in10mc,**[For the uninitiated.](https://www.google.com/images?q=jeffree+star)**
6379,2020-09-05 19:53:34,in10mc,"Yes, I agree"
6380,2020-09-05 19:53:52,in10mc,Why are these creepy looking people beauty gurus?
6381,2020-09-05 19:54:06,in10mc,Who?

6383,2020-09-05 19:55:04,in10mc,Yeah but he will laugh all the way to the bank Like Marylynn Mason.  Some day he will decide to go normal and blend right in....... and prob be unrecognizable.
6384,2020-09-05 19:55:18,in10mc,He reminds me of Rosswall from Re:Zero
6385,2020-09-05 19:57:35,in10mc,I used to like his stuff until I found out about how much of a piece of shit he and Shane Dawson are. Totally sick people. Mentally ill.
6386,2020-09-05 19:57:39,in10mc,When I saw him for the first time I was like “ew wtf? People think this guy is handsome?”
6387,2020-09-05 19:58:33,in10mc,Look up Jessica Yaniv...
6388,2020-09-05 19:59:37,in10mc,"I don’t mind his appearance, just his crappy character."
6389,2020-09-05 20:00:28,in10mc,He has no talent
6390,2020-09-05 20:00:45,in10mc,I had to Google him and now I understand.
6391,2020-09-05 20:03:25,in10mc,He's so ugly on both the inside and the outside. Like a malnourished tatted up skeletor
6392,2020-09-05 20:03:26,in10mc,He looks like if Marilyn Manson have a son with a walking dead clown.
6393,2020-09-05 20:03:38,in10mc,He looks like one of those motherfuckers from the capitol in the Hunger Games
6394,2020-09-05 20:03:47,in10mc,"Now that you mention it, I find most twitter or instagram-famous people are slightly more attractive than the average person admittedly, but they alter their entire bodies the more famous they get where they start to look like literal wax figures."
6395,2020-09-05 20:03:52,in10mc,He's the embodiment of 90s music videos.
6396,2020-09-05 20:05:01,in10mc,"I definitely agree, but I do like some of his tattoos, like the LV ones on his hands"
6397,2020-09-05 20:05:22,in10mc,Finally an opinion that is atleast slightly unpopular. This subreddit has a LOT of popular opinions with thousands of upvotes.
6398,2020-09-05 20:06:03,in10mc,I always thought he's just doing a Gwen Stefani in drag impression...
6399,2020-09-05 20:06:07,in10mc,Him and James Charles too.
6400,2020-09-05 20:07:25,in10mc,This isn't unpopular. A lot of ppl don't like him. I like him.
6401,2020-09-05 20:07:42,in10mc,You haven’t seen me ; )
6402,2020-09-05 20:07:57,in10mc,"“Beauty YouTube community” 
*Ugliest people in existence*"
6403,2020-09-05 20:09:37,in10mc,The only likeable thing about that douche is his bank account but even then you couldn’t pay me to say he’s handsome.
6404,2020-09-05 20:10:29,in10mc,Yes
6405,2020-09-05 20:10:41,in10mc,THANK YOU! I absolutely can NOT stand him.
6406,2020-09-05 20:10:48,in10mc,"Holy fuck, I just googled him and I don't think I'll be able to sleep tonight"
6407,2020-09-05 20:11:56,in10mc,"Thanks, i didnt have plans on sleeping tonight.

/S 

People who dont know, dont google him like i did."
6408,2020-09-05 20:13:08,in10mc,"He was at Warped Tour in like 2010 or something, my buddies and I needed to just sit down for a minute and ended up at his stage because it was the only one with seating.  After maybe five minutes we were up and walking again.  Gross dude, gross personality, gross music"
6409,2020-09-05 20:14:14,in10mc,"tbh I don’t think the majority of the people who call him gorgeous and fashionable actually think that, and are more doing it because body positivity and all that. I dont doubt that there are some people who actually do find him attractive but for the most part I think mainly it is people trying to not be called homophobic, transphobic, a gender stereotype pusher, etc. 

also I bet there are quite a few women who actually find him attractive because honestly his facial features are still quite masculine, and thus may be attractive to a straight woman."
6410,2020-09-05 20:14:21,in10mc,Omfg not this going viral💀💀
6411,2020-09-05 20:16:18,in10mc,I’ve seen zero redeeming qualities
6412,2020-09-05 20:16:34,in10mc,Who?
6413,2020-09-05 20:17:40,in10mc,Did your wife leave you for jeffrey? xD. He is ugly.
6414,2020-09-05 20:18:15,in10mc,Yes. He looks pretty much like a demon. I'm not sure what's supposed to be attractive about a skinny guy in makeup.
6415,2020-09-05 20:19:05,in10mc,Yes imo James Charles looks so cute and you can tell he is a genuine person but Jeffree Star flat out looks like a snake and he looks disgusting. Oh I have always been thinking about it
6416,2020-09-05 20:19:17,in10mc,i never watched his Youtube channel I just saw him a couple of times here and there on news and stuff and I legit thought that he was just an ugly girl with tons of make-up first.
6417,2020-09-05 20:20:40,in10mc,"To me it’s not his looks that makes him ugly, it’s his personality."
6418,2020-09-05 20:21:01,in10mc,"To me it’s not his looks that make him ugly, it’s his personality."
6419,2020-09-05 20:21:29,in10mc,"Just another trans make up artist. Like a million others. But, I get it."
6420,2020-09-05 20:21:32,in10mc,pretty sure his whole 'appeal' is that he looks like a villain
6421,2020-09-05 20:24:23,in10mc,Thank God someone has posted something about this. Not say this sarcasticly.
6422,2020-09-05 20:25:13,in10mc,I think his personality is worse than his looks.
6423,2020-09-05 20:25:33,in10mc,I just looked up who that was and now I need to throw the internet in the trash.
6424,2020-09-05 20:25:48,in10mc,This shouldn’t be an unpopular opinion I’m more likely to scream from seeing him than a literal fucking tarantula and I’m an arachnophobe
6425,2020-09-05 20:25:53,in10mc,Very popular opinion
6426,2020-09-05 20:25:59,in10mc,He looks like he's been corrupted by the Ring of Power
6427,2020-09-05 20:26:25,in10mc,You can’t say that. He is stunning and brave. Sure he’s a disgusting example of human being but the courage to wear makeup in public overrides that.
6428,2020-09-05 20:26:30,in10mc,"He really does look like a guy in cartoons, saying that he's a good guy to the main characters, while he was the villain all along.

Edit: punctuation and spelling"
6429,2020-09-05 20:27:25,in10mc,An unwrapped mummy is my go to description
6430,2020-09-05 20:29:26,in10mc,"Yup, ugly on the inside and outside. 

And to think the surgeries actually improved his appearance lol"
6431,2020-09-05 20:29:54,in10mc,how's it feel knowing the ugliest creature on the planet is more successful than you'll ever be....
6432,2020-09-05 20:30:42,in10mc,Reminds me of Roger from American Dad
6433,2020-09-05 20:30:45,in10mc,Down vote because I don't think this is an unpopular opinion.
6434,2020-09-05 20:31:05,in10mc,Pretty sure this is popular opinion to even him since he needs to cake his face in every video lmao
6435,2020-09-05 20:31:28,in10mc,Hes ugly inside and out.

6442,2020-09-05 20:37:25,in10mc,"I don’t think this is unpopular. 

Too bad his insides are where the most ugly lies."
6443,2020-09-05 20:37:56,in10mc,People call him gorgeous? Lol
6444,2020-09-05 20:38:16,in10mc,He has a striking resemblance to he who must not be named.
6445,2020-09-05 20:42:26,in10mc,Checks out.
6446,2020-09-05 20:44:43,in10mc,"He sells make up for a reason. If it can fix his face, damn sure it can fix any face"
6447,2020-09-05 20:47:45,in10mc,His appearance isn't ugly in my opinion but it's not like beautiful to me he looks as though he is trying to be something different than human
6448,2020-09-05 20:49:21,in10mc,"Jeffree Star is morally reprehensible and I hated listening to his verse on that weird hollywood undead track when I was a teen.
Yuck."
6449,2020-09-05 20:49:26,in10mc,"Imagine a little kid walking up to him and saying ""take me to your leader""."
6450,2020-09-05 20:49:28,in10mc, He looks like a bad cosplay of some character except he’s not cosplaying anybody and it’s sad.
6451,2020-09-05 20:50:50,in10mc,He is the epitome of r/atbge
6452,2020-09-05 20:51:04,in10mc,"I hate how he has no eyebrows, its so weird to look at, but I’ve never liked him even before he got exposed. He’s just a bad person imo. sassy gay ain’t a personality, that’s a choice"
6453,2020-09-05 20:51:17,in10mc,Thats what plastic surgery does to you
6454,2020-09-05 20:51:42,in10mc,Honest to god question - what does he identify as?
6455,2020-09-05 20:53:03,in10mc,"I feel like your post should be a popular opinion.

Everyone is beautiful- here cut my face and make me look nothing like a normal human being"
6456,2020-09-05 20:53:10,in10mc,Who tf is Jeffree Star?
6457,2020-09-05 20:53:16,in10mc,I just looked him(?) up and can solidly say that is the most horrifying creature I've ever seen. It's the stuff of nightmares
6458,2020-09-05 20:53:36,in10mc,He’s scary. I’m pretty sure I’ve had nightmares of him. LOOK NOT LIKE A CLOWN!!!

6461,2020-09-05 20:56:53,in10mc,"If you're dating a woamn who likes him, that's a red flag."
6462,2020-09-05 20:57:16,in10mc,For a moment I was wondering why people hating on the rock star with the lightning bolt make up on his face then I realized that was David Bowie and now idk who Jeffrey Star is.
6463,2020-09-05 20:57:40,in10mc,Idk if you know what feelings are but he has them.
6464,2020-09-05 20:57:56,in10mc,Motherfucker looks like Ebony Maw.
6465,2020-09-05 20:58:59,in10mc,https://youtu.be/7T9yMSNG1iQ
6466,2020-09-05 21:00:03,in10mc,2004 not so much but his personality is total horse shit. So you’re not wrong
6467,2020-09-05 21:00:30,in10mc,"I don't like him as a person, but people can do whatever they want to their face... I wouldn't call him ugly, I just don't find him attractive"
6468,2020-09-05 21:01:08,in10mc,"I don’t believe picking on someone’s looks is the best way to go about it. There’s plenty more ugly, disgusting shit in his past that you can insult him with. That being said, I agree lmao"
6469,2020-09-05 21:01:53,in10mc,Even though he's rich he has no fashion sense.So tacky.
6470,2020-09-05 21:01:55,in10mc,Isnt he dating some NBA player?
6471,2020-09-05 21:02:38,in10mc,I'm not entirely sure this is that much of an unpopular opinion.
6472,2020-09-05 21:05:00,in10mc,"His personality is shitty, too. Ugly inside and out."
6473,2020-09-05 21:05:14,in10mc,He looks like orochimaru
6474,2020-09-05 21:05:17,in10mc, This is just mean lol.
6475,2020-09-05 21:06:15,in10mc,Normally I’m not into going after people’s appearances but he’s a monster so idc. He looks like if Roger the Alien was a person
6476,2020-09-05 21:07:04,in10mc,"He has some gall for criticizing others' appearances, given the work he's had done to him."
6477,2020-09-05 21:09:39,in10mc,I feel bad for his dad.
6478,2020-09-05 21:13:07,in10mc,"Honestly, he reminds me of the people from the Capitol in the Hunger Games. Both in terms of personality and looks.."
6479,2020-09-05 21:13:09,in10mc,Came on here looking for the people trying to defend him but sadly didn't see any lol... but yea his appearance is very disturbing my wife showed me him one time and I thought it was someone doing a cosplay of some woman trying to make fun of her or something was blown away by the fact he's a millionaire
6480,2020-09-05 21:14:32,in10mc,His makeup isn’t that great either 🤷🏽‍♀️
6481,2020-09-05 21:18:19,in10mc,I wonder what he would look like now without the fake teeth and everything
6482,2020-09-05 21:19:32,in10mc,It feels good not knowing who this person is.
6483,2020-09-05 21:23:49,in10mc,Idk. I’ve seen worse. Da baby. Post Lamon. The list goes on. Oh. That 69 guy. I mean. Some ugly motherfuckers. Jay z. The kardashians. Snooki. Who else?
6484,2020-09-05 21:24:39,in10mc,Classic unpopular opinion
6485,2020-09-05 21:24:54,in10mc,this is unpopular?
6486,2020-09-05 21:27:17,in10mc,His makeup lines look like what toddlers do with makeup except they have intensely sexual names
6487,2020-09-05 21:29:31,in10mc,"I dunno, you ever heard of Dahvie Vanity? He's like Jeffree Star but also a pedophile"
6488,2020-09-05 21:31:31,in10mc,"So this opinion is supposed to be unpopular but it got 16.8k upvotes. This world is fucked, people are liars, cowards and full of hypocrisy just faking as much as they can, so whatever"
6489,2020-09-05 21:32:20,in10mc,I'm sorry you had to let me know about this sad human being
6490,2020-09-05 21:33:00,in10mc,i think that’s the intention to look like he is not from earth
6491,2020-09-05 21:34:01,in10mc,What a gremlin
6492,2020-09-05 21:36:50,in10mc,He looks better with eyebrows and without makeup. Same thing with James Charles. Why do people like to put on makeup that makes them look like a ben10 alien
6493,2020-09-05 21:37:53,in10mc,About as off putting as Marilyn Manson in appearance and from what I’ve heard a shitty person too.
6494,2020-09-05 21:40:47,in10mc,This is for unpopular opinions bud
6495,2020-09-05 21:41:06,in10mc,"At this point, it's a pretty popular opinion."
6496,2020-09-05 21:41:12,in10mc,Never knew who this guy was and now i can't get his image out.
6497,2020-09-05 21:41:13,in10mc,I've seen so many Jeffree Star posts on this subreddit this isn't unpopular.
6498,2020-09-05 21:41:27,in10mc,"Oh look, a boy ina dress."
6499,2020-09-05 21:42:28,in10mc,he looks like a techno/industrial artist
6500,2020-09-05 21:42:30,in10mc,"I was watching his stuff back in the day, but all the stuff about his past came up and he'd keep getting into all the drama. I just couldn't look at the dude the same"
6501,2020-09-05 21:42:52,in10mc,"It interesting because he’s one of the most famous beauty gurus, but I truly don’t think his makeup looks are good. If anyone else shaved off their eyebrows and popped their crease color where their brow bone is, they wouldn’t get anywhere as a makeup artist."
6502,2020-09-05 21:43:51,in10mc,"I don't think this qualifies as an ""unpopular"" opinion. Jeffree Star's hair is just as fake as his personality."
6503,2020-09-05 21:44:14,in10mc,"how does this shit bullying go on popular?.

i dont like his apperance but this is straight up bullying"

6507,2020-09-05 21:47:29,in10mc,He looks like a gay xenomorph.
6508,2020-09-05 21:48:25,in10mc,"Had to look up who this is.

Can't see why that'd be an unpopular opinion."
6509,2020-09-05 21:49:01,in10mc,Why???? I was so happy not knowing about this goblin
6510,2020-09-05 21:51:04,in10mc,LMAO what about me?!?!
6511,2020-09-05 21:52:24,in10mc,No. Saying that his fashion choices are unorthodox is correct. Saying he is objectively ugly is not.
6512,2020-09-05 21:54:13,in10mc,It’s funny how Facts can be unpopular

6517,2020-09-05 21:54:53,in10mc,Meat canyon compared him to an Afghan hound.
6518,2020-09-05 21:57:10,in10mc,He looks like something you’d find under your bed at night

6523,2020-09-05 22:01:19,in10mc,I agree he’s a weirdo
6524,2020-09-05 22:01:32,in10mc,100%

6526,2020-09-05 22:02:34,in10mc,"If youre looking for someone to agree with you, i mean... i certainly do.  quite a bit.   but, im sure we all are culturally aware enough to realize how different style has been over time, even in the last 20 years through out different cultures.  im personally working on just accepting people like that, not focusing on how ugly and mutant like i think they may look.  You didnt say mutant like but i did. hah."
6527,2020-09-05 22:03:20,in10mc,What the fuckin fuckity fucken fuck is that thing?????? Thank you for giving me endless nightmare fuel mate
6528,2020-09-05 22:04:40,in10mc,And let’s not even get started on his personality.
6529,2020-09-05 22:06:23,in10mc,I'd say that [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7T9yMSNG1iQ) accurately describes him
6530,2020-09-05 22:07:38,in10mc,Thought this was unpopular opinions
6531,2020-09-05 22:08:15,in10mc,This post is really funny lol

6535,2020-09-05 22:12:35,in10mc,"I’m not one for bashing people on their appearance, but this dude is an exception."
6536,2020-09-05 22:12:48,in10mc,I've always said he looks like the pop version of Marilyn Manson.
6537,2020-09-05 22:13:21,in10mc,I remember finding out about him in sixth grade around like 2007 and he literally scared the hell out of me as a kid
6538,2020-09-05 22:15:17,in10mc,Fuck that fuck. What a talentles freak. I truly dont get it in the least
6539,2020-09-05 22:15:21,in10mc,So glad you made me google that name. Now I’ll have nightmares.

6542,2020-09-05 22:21:15,in10mc,"I don't think the long hair suits him very well, sure there are many guys that can pull it off but I really think he would look better if it was much shorter."
6543,2020-09-05 22:21:23,in10mc,"Jeffree Star is the ugliest person on the planet but that has nothing to do with his looks. I'm all for people expressing themselves and there's someone for everyone. For me, it's the way he's treated everyone around him and cannot handle anyone else succeeding, stopping at nothing to bring them down that makes him ugly."
6544,2020-09-05 22:21:36,in10mc,His physical appearance doesn’t even scratch the surface of how ugly of a person he is
6545,2020-09-05 22:22:38,in10mc,He is brave. He is a hero.
6546,2020-09-05 22:22:54,in10mc,This is the truth: If that freak was unknown and he shared his pic online he would be hated to death by everyone.
6547,2020-09-05 22:23:10,in10mc,THIS. he looks like a tree from the Lorax just covered in make-up and tattoos
6548,2020-09-05 22:23:22,in10mc,"Yeah whenever I see him on Instagram or snapchat or someshit I have to block the account or hit “see less of this.” Nasty. To each their own, but that’s taking it a little too far."
6549,2020-09-05 22:24:53,in10mc,Bad and Boujee Voldemort
6550,2020-09-05 22:25:19,in10mc,he (she?) looks like Grand Moff Tarkin lmao
6551,2020-09-05 22:25:32,in10mc,I disagree with the fact that you posted this to r/unpopularopinion
6552,2020-09-05 22:25:36,in10mc,Not unpopular

6554,2020-09-05 22:27:35,in10mc,He look like skeletor with fake titties
6555,2020-09-05 22:28:16,in10mc,He's disgusting on the inside too.
6556,2020-09-05 22:28:35,in10mc,"If you melted a Ken doll and used gumball machine stickers for a new face, it would still look better than that makeup homonculous"
6557,2020-09-05 22:29:49,in10mc,"I met Jeffree Star many years ago. He had a band, more  like sang with a DJ, and opened for Blood on the Dance Floor. I set up and ran the sound equipment.  He was really nice to me. Had a diva vibe, but wasn't a dick about it.

He looked a little more normal then... but not much different."
6558,2020-09-05 22:29:50,in10mc,"Where is all this anti-elf sentiment coming from? Elves are beautiful creatures. Shame on you!  
PS- Jeffreestar is not an elf. Jeffreestar is a human. I think..."
6559,2020-09-05 22:30:06,in10mc,"I mean, he does whatever he wants"
6560,2020-09-05 22:31:08,in10mc,Remember how he was one of the main accusers of James Charles preying on straight men when he literally has a whole song about doing just that 🥳
6561,2020-09-05 22:32:29,in10mc,"I remember when he was shilling one of his highlighters... he put that on his face and it looked like smeared grease. ""just like glyyyyyaaaasss, yes werk"". 

Uh no."
6562,2020-09-05 22:35:20,in10mc,It's a toss up between them and that instamodel that calls themselves Mary Magdalene
6563,2020-09-05 22:35:56,in10mc,Spock looks better than him and i should know i love spock
6564,2020-09-05 22:37:39,in10mc,"I don’t give a shit, is that unpopular?"
6565,2020-09-05 22:39:04,in10mc,He looks like Lucius Malfoy from Harry Potter but like the facial structure of kakashi sansei from naruto.
6566,2020-09-05 22:39:34,in10mc,Lol true. Hate seeing that garbage on yt
6567,2020-09-05 22:39:52,in10mc,Fax no printer
6568,2020-09-05 22:40:29,in10mc,I'm not sure this is unpopular.
6569,2020-09-05 22:40:35,in10mc,His D&D Campaign isnt over
6570,2020-09-05 22:41:25,in10mc,Look like the Guy in hanibal who's face was shredded
6571,2020-09-05 22:42:12,in10mc,"Not only he dress up like a murdering clown but he is a shitty human being as well , he likes to force people in to drama , start fights , sexual harassment and other shitty things .."
6572,2020-09-05 22:42:39,in10mc,"I don't actually hate his personality or anything because I haven't seen any of his videos but looks wise, yes."
6573,2020-09-05 22:42:51,in10mc,You're pretty brave to say that
6574,2020-09-05 22:44:14,in10mc,oh boy that’s not even the worst part op
6575,2020-09-05 22:50:21,in10mc,"Look however you want idc, but oh boy is he ugly on the inside. Besides, something about having a tattoo of JonBenet Ramsay rubs me very much the wrong way."
6576,2020-09-05 22:50:51,in10mc,Look what happened to Voldemort! Doing vile stuff will mess you up both mentally and physically!
6577,2020-09-05 22:51:26,in10mc,He’s a weirdo and he also has a history of sexual harassment against dudes in Los Angeles.
6578,2020-09-05 22:53:30,in10mc,"Pretty sure this has been a pretty common thought since the MySpace days. Could swear I've seen him in those, ""Top 10 People you wouldn't believe exist,"" windows movie maker YouTube videos from '07-'09"
6579,2020-09-05 22:54:02,in10mc,He looks like a low budget voldemort for a rip-off harry potter movie
6580,2020-09-05 22:54:55,in10mc,I had no idea who Jeffrey Star is when I saw this thread so I did a Google image search. Completely agree.
6581,2020-09-05 22:56:19,in10mc,"I’ve never once cared for him, I always found him painfully annoying and stuck up."
6582,2020-09-05 22:57:45,in10mc,I would genuinely think that his face looks good if he wasn’t evil.
6583,2020-09-05 22:58:32,in10mc,Gives me rickety cricket vibes.

6585,2020-09-05 23:02:17,in10mc,Ok but his personality is the ugliest
6586,2020-09-05 23:03:17,in10mc,White people like him a lot especially white gay people. He has a lot of money I envy him for that tho
6587,2020-09-05 23:03:25,in10mc,He's uglier on the inside
6588,2020-09-05 23:03:29,in10mc,He has great skin though
6589,2020-09-05 23:04:03,in10mc,I have friends that were in his close circles back in my Hollywood Blvd. days...and man the amount of stories they would tell me about this guy and the things he’d do to younger guys is absolutely insane.
6590,2020-09-05 23:05:29,in10mc,This is a POPULAR opinion without a doubt. Thanks for posting OP. I can’t stand that creature/thing/they/it whatever.
6591,2020-09-05 23:06:27,in10mc,If you didn't make this post I would have never looked up. I don't know you and I hate you
6592,2020-09-05 23:06:44,in10mc,"Is this REALLY what this subreddit has come to? Who people think is ugly? 

Jesus Christ....unjoining now."
6593,2020-09-05 23:06:47,in10mc,Wow yeah I agree
6594,2020-09-05 23:06:58,in10mc,MeatCanyon on YouTube did a pretty accurate interpretation of him
6595,2020-09-05 23:07:18,in10mc,I don't like hurting people on their appearance but basically what you did is explain his outside and inside. What he does sometimes is. D I S G U S T I N G!
6596,2020-09-05 23:07:33,in10mc,He needs to work on his Blue Steel.
6597,2020-09-05 23:10:02,in10mc,U rite doe
6598,2020-09-05 23:13:46,in10mc,He does not look good man. Ugly on the outside and inside.
6599,2020-09-05 23:14:48,in10mc,"Finally, someone thinks I'm not the ugliest person on the planet."
6600,2020-09-05 23:15:00,in10mc,"I mean he's trash but let's not insult people's looks, because that's not just insulting them, it's insulting everyone who looks like that."
6601,2020-09-05 23:15:38,in10mc,Damn near agree
6602,2020-09-05 23:16:17,in10mc,Sounds like Markle!!
6603,2020-09-05 23:16:40,in10mc,"Not going to comment on his personality, brand, etc. because I think most of us who know his name know what a piece of shit he is, but on the look alone:

I think looking weird, unsettling, and nearly gross by using extreme versions of techniques that are used for beauty is the point. He’s obviously not going for a conventionally attractive look and it seems inappropriate to pass judgement based on that. As an edgy teen in the 2000’s I wore heavy goth makeup, and I definitely had the goal of being fashionable (to a specific type of fashion) gorgeous, and disgusting. The goal isn’t looking naturally pretty, or even necessarily attractive. 

 Some looks I’ve seen him and similar influencers do can unsettle me so I get what you’re saying, but in art/fashion I enjoy that. That type of expression isn’t going to appeal to everyone just as it doesn’t for you, and I don’t actually think this is an unpopular opinion at all."
6604,2020-09-05 23:17:41,in10mc,This is an extremely popular opinion
6605,2020-09-05 23:17:59,in10mc, I had to Google who he was.... so this generation's 'Boy George'?
6606,2020-09-05 23:18:01,in10mc,"This is not an unpopular opinion.

But I’m upvoting because I want Jeffree Star himself or his team to see this post."
6607,2020-09-05 23:18:24,in10mc,How has he managed to convince people he's a make up guru looking like that.
6608,2020-09-05 23:20:00,in10mc,Lmao he wants to be in a Louis coffin idk I’m pretty sure God AINT gonna give him a seat in sweet heavens
6609,2020-09-05 23:24:40,in10mc,Who?
6610,2020-09-05 23:26:33,in10mc,This definitely is not an unpopular opinion because I 100000% agree
6611,2020-09-05 23:26:33,in10mc,"If by Jeffree Star you mean Lil Wayne, then yes."
6612,2020-09-05 23:27:15,in10mc,clown maybe but with huge income
6613,2020-09-05 23:27:36,in10mc,I think Meatcanyon brought justice.
6614,2020-09-05 23:28:21,in10mc,It’s wonderful to see hate running rampant towards all directions. Doesn’t matter who you are. This is equal opportunity hate
6615,2020-09-05 23:31:02,in10mc,I thought this was r/unpopularopinion not r/everyone agrees with you. Couldnt of said it better myself bro
6616,2020-09-05 23:31:24,in10mc,that's a fact
6617,2020-09-05 23:31:49,in10mc,I'd agree with ya on that one.
6618,2020-09-05 23:33:27,in10mc,He’s just as bad with his actions as well
6619,2020-09-05 23:33:52,in10mc,The Toys 'R' Us mascot?
6620,2020-09-05 23:39:34,in10mc,I feel like this for James Charles too tbh
6621,2020-09-05 23:41:38,in10mc,I think he looks hot. :/ but well this is r/unpopularopinion I guess
6622,2020-09-05 23:43:46,in10mc,He reminds me of Prince Nuada in Hellboy Golden Army.
6623,2020-09-05 23:49:36,in10mc,"At least other beauty gurus like james charles are kinda cute, Jeffree looks like if post malone went through a crossdressing phase."
6624,2020-09-05 23:49:55,in10mc,I second this
6625,2020-09-05 23:51:51,in10mc,"He wears facial merges. He wasn't always ugly, but he looks cross-species and tropical now."
6626,2020-09-05 23:52:36,in10mc,Damn that title is straight to the point lmfao
6627,2020-09-05 23:52:53,in10mc,Pretty sure that’s a popular opinion
6628,2020-09-05 23:53:30,in10mc,This ain't unpopular
6629,2020-09-05 23:55:08,in10mc,"I don’t think he’s an attractive person (he isn’t either on the inside) but doing a a whole post bullying him on his looks seems very childish. Of course majority sees him  and thinks he’s unattractive but this is just childish. 26k people damn. I don’t support him whatsoever but doing a whole entire post towards someone to send hate is messed up. Again, I don’t support him :/"
6630,2020-09-05 23:57:24,in10mc,Check out Meat Canyon's Jeffery Star cartoon on youtube lol.

6664,2020-09-25 01:17:36,in10mc,He looks pretty ugly I feel like people only say hes beautiful because they like a sassy gay man
6665,2020-10-17 18:18:53,in10mc,"He's so skinny and tall that you could melt his face off, put him in an IKEA outfit and plop him right in SCP-3008 and I wouldn't notice a damn thing."
6666,2020-12-08 13:49:12,in10mc,100%

6668,2020-09-05 21:22:41,in10mc,I googled who he is cause I didn't know but now I think I should've googled what IS. What is even that? A transgender who stopped the surgery halfway through?
6669,2020-09-05 21:24:12,in10mc,Never seen this person before...but wow. Looking at them makes me physically uncomfortable. It's like one of those aliens that attempts to take on a human form but can't perfect it. Is this thing a he or she? Or...both?
6670,2020-09-05 21:24:38,in10mc,"Haha I love it. I completely disagree and think he’s awesome, but hey each to their own. People with his personality thrive on drama and it’s because of people with your opinion, people like him thrive and become successful.

Neither are in the wrong, it’s all apart of the human experience and just because we dislike something doesn’t mean we have to be intolerant of it. I hate gay men in assless chaps, but I’m still bi... and love many a gay man."
6671,2020-09-06 00:34:41,in10mc,Him and James Charles both need to vanish from the spotlight. They give non binary people a bad name.
6672,2020-09-06 01:02:04,in10mc,I just googled him and I want to throw up.
6673,2020-09-06 01:18:54,in10mc,That motherfucker is nasty. Thank you for posting this
6674,2020-09-06 01:43:28,in10mc,"""My new Lamborghini is the same color as my clit"" & has pictures of himself half-nude in thongs. 

I don't know what disturbs me more: a 34-year old man talks and acts this way or nearly 15 million find this content enjoyable....."
6675,2020-09-06 01:43:52,in10mc,Lol I was watching a video about him when I saw this post. It’s all completely true and he can’t even put his wig on roght
6676,2020-09-06 02:10:39,in10mc,Ugly on the inside and out. Does so much extremely stupid shit.
6677,2020-09-06 02:11:05,in10mc,On top of that he's a horrible person. I saw him back in the Myspace days he did a meet and greet at bamboozle and I made sure to give him a piece of my mind because he was being such a human piece of garbage and I'm glad I did.
6678,2020-09-06 02:44:04,in10mc,"This isn't unpopular

He looks like a reject from a blow up doll factory"
6679,2020-09-06 03:33:43,in10mc,I dont even think that thing is human.
6680,2020-09-05 18:40:27,in10mc,I don't understand how people like him can be into drag stuff
6681,2020-09-05 18:42:59,in10mc,"His attitude is the real ugly part. 

I do appreciate him pushing the boundaries of what people look like. It’s like irl Star Trek"
6682,2020-09-05 19:31:20,in10mc,"Nah, Michael Jackson after plastic surgery is the ugliest, scariest, most disgusting looking ""human"" I've ever seen."

6684,2020-09-05 19:42:42,in10mc,It is ugly
6685,2020-09-05 20:20:14,in10mc,Ewwwwwwww. You made me google that... thing.
6686,2020-09-05 20:21:28,in10mc,"I've surprisingly never heard someone say anything like this before, but I completely agree. Ugliest thing I've ever seen"
6687,2020-09-05 20:22:32,in10mc,"I had no idea this bone faced donkey even existed, but after reading about him a bit, I have concluded that he's on his way to the top...

6688,2020-09-05 20:27:12,in10mc,That creature is disgusting. I didn't know what it was until I googled it just now. It needs to be removed from the earth.
6689,2020-09-05 20:33:09,in10mc,Thank you all so much for the upvotes and rewards! I can't express how thankful I am ;)
6690,2020-09-05 20:41:56,in10mc,"Meh. He's a human, not a creature. It's ok to find him unattractive though. The whole no eyebrow thing is a little weird."
6691,2020-09-05 20:42:24,in10mc,"Oh what the fuck I just google ""It"" and I am in loss of words, he would probably a stand user in JoJo"
6692,2020-09-05 20:46:14,in10mc,Wtf is it?
6693,2020-09-05 20:48:12,in10mc,"He doesn't even need makeup to look like shrek, that thing already is an ogre."
6694,2020-09-05 21:04:54,in10mc,It**
6695,2020-09-05 21:09:38,in10mc,here is a hate speech disguised as an opinion. grow up and stop commenting on peoples physical appereance
6696,2020-09-05 21:10:23,in10mc,I googled that.. Thx man! I'll see that thing now non stop on youtube ffs
6697,2020-09-05 21:11:28,in10mc,I googled him and I'm glad I don't go to the parts of internet with such creatures
6698,2020-09-05 21:18:31,in10mc,Y’all r fucking toxic on this app lamo
6699,2020-09-05 21:33:51,in10mc,"Man, this is just rude. Why do people upvote this?

You don't just call someone ""disgusting"". It's wrong."
6700,2020-09-05 22:21:32,in10mc,This post is just flat out insults.  Downvote.
6701,2020-09-05 22:35:12,in10mc,"Ditto for all the people constantly showing up on the Reddit front page on this drag race TV shows. If gay people want to watch drag queen contests that's fine, but how on earth does it constantly end up on the top of r/popular"
6702,2020-09-05 22:52:39,in10mc,Wait that’s a dude?
6703,2020-09-05 22:52:39,in10mc,Just another mentally ill guy

6708,2020-09-06 00:23:24,in10mc,This isn’t unpopular
6709,2020-09-06 00:28:31,in10mc,"I feel so bad thinking this because so many of my friends are queens and they LOVE him.  I think we can all agree that his makeup lines are slightly above avg, but jeffree himself is so ugly inside and out.  I know hes a big inspiration in the community, but we need to stop rewarding someone like him."
6710,2020-09-06 00:29:42,in10mc,Yeah well he’s rich so he doesn’t have to care what other people think lol
6711,2020-09-06 00:35:52,in10mc,Hes absolutely absolutely disgusting inside AND out
6712,2020-09-06 00:39:33,in10mc,"How is this an unpopular opinion? I didn't know who this guy was, but he looks like something out of nightmare, I dont understand how anybody can find it fashionable"
6713,2020-09-06 00:46:18,in10mc,And he’s a horrible person
6714,2020-09-06 01:02:29,in10mc,Feel like this is a popular opinion
6715,2020-09-06 01:04:50,in10mc,Please explain why you believe this opinion to be unpopular.
6716,2020-09-06 01:07:05,in10mc,I think he looks like that because of his hyperthyroidism.
6717,2020-09-06 01:48:57,in10mc,He looks like an alien or an extraterrestrial creature
6718,2020-09-06 01:58:35,in10mc,"I hate Jefree but I don’t think OP is concerned about his personality. It’s not cool to call someone disgusting cause of tattoos. He looks fine. His personality is terrible. 

A national ban on Jefree and Cardi b to save 2020! Yes yes !"
6719,2020-09-06 02:07:54,in10mc,Who hurt you?
6720,2020-09-06 02:14:32,in10mc,He looks like a skeleton. Never understood why people find plastic and makeup attractive
6721,2020-09-06 02:41:20,in10mc,Another popular opinion on unpopular opinion.
6722,2020-09-06 02:42:52,in10mc,"I feel like this is homophobic. Do you think drag queens are ""disgusting""?"
6723,2020-09-06 02:58:53,in10mc,This is such a disgusting post. Write about how he’s a racist instead
6724,2020-09-06 03:02:19,in10mc,"He looks pretty much like your standard plastic model want-to-be white girl. His lack of eyebrows bothers me the most, and honestly needs to gain some weight. (He looks sickly/frail)"
6725,2020-09-06 04:27:55,in10mc,Him and Kim when she had platinum blonde hair looked like aliens
6726,2020-09-06 06:49:33,in10mc,His aesthetic horror is only surpassed by the cthulhu scaring monstrosity that is his personality. Anything he touches turns to dogshit.
6727,2020-09-06 07:14:44,in10mc,This is not an unpopular opinion
6728,2020-09-06 07:36:24,in10mc,"As a person who experienced him first hand, back in the early 2000s he used to hang around the Irvine spectrum where me and my friends would hangout on some weekends and he always had a little horde of hot topic looking folks with him and honestly he’s even scarier and more repulsive in person."
6729,2020-09-06 12:18:54,in10mc,"Agreed, I don’t understand how people look up to him and the worst part it’s mostly young impressionable kids who think he has all the answers when it comes to beauty"
6730,2020-09-06 17:56:46,in10mc,This should be not only a popular opinion but common knowledge.
6731,2020-09-05 23:30:23,in10mc,"I'm not here to defend JS or any if his actions, but has this sub become so pathetic that this kind of post makes it to the top? Like, calling people ugly and grosse to look at is an unpopular opinion?"
6732,2020-09-05 23:55:46,in10mc,"What a disgusting thing to post about somebody. Even if he’s not your cup of tea, the tone of judgment here is gross."
6733,2020-09-05 23:57:06,in10mc,Get a hobby
6734,2020-09-06 00:14:10,in10mc,"Seems to me the ugliest person on the planet atm is the person who decided it would bring them great accolades by trashing a person and the only way they found to get themselves some attention is to attack another for their how different they are....remember people that what yiu say about others says more about you....doesn't matter what someone else does, be responsible for your own actions and own up to them..."
6735,2020-09-06 00:23:01,in10mc,How can you hate someone this much because of their appearance? Are you ok my man ?
6736,2020-09-06 02:03:56,in10mc,"He is a ugly creature on the inside yes, but so are you for basically judging someone just on their looks."
6737,2020-09-05 18:09:29,in10mc,"Trashing peoples appearance is unsavory to me personally, but you do you."
6738,2020-09-05 16:39:51,in10mc,"I personally can not stand the man myself, for various reasons pertaining to his toxic and manipulative behavior, but I can’t imagine even thinking about the things you wrote on here. “His make-up probably adds a few kilos to his body weight” like it is just so strange to me to have this much hatred for someone you’ve never met, likely never will, and, if you had not found out about him on the Internet, would not affect your life. 

My unpopular opinion: people who feel this way about strangers need to look into why they feel the desire to lash out on others based on appearance. Try therapy please. It probably starts with what you think about yourself."

6741,2020-09-05 23:31:58,in10mc,Unpopular opinion btw
6742,2020-09-06 05:38:14,in10mc,"Who gives a shit? Let people do what they want. Chances are you'll never meet him/ her irl, and you have to option to follow or unfollow them on social media. Calling someone ugly, especially in a Reddit post because of how they present themselves isn't a ""unpopular opinion"", even when most people would agree. Also I'm aware of his personality, that's another thing. I just don't believe in shaming someone for how they look, especially publicly. Just my unpopular opinion"

6744,2020-09-05 19:03:43,in10mc,Look I'm not a fan of Jeffree Star but this post is just harassment and there is no need for it. There are loads of other things you can criticise him on but picking his looks really reflects poorly on yourself.
6745,2020-09-05 20:35:35,in10mc,Can y’all imagine coming in a thread just to hate a multimillionaire who doesn’t give a shit about your opinions. CANT RELATE.
6746,2020-09-05 17:08:10,in10mc,Not unpopular
6747,2020-09-05 20:38:19,in10mc,Who?
6748,2020-09-05 20:50:14,in10mc,Is he trans now or what?
6749,2020-09-05 21:01:05,in10mc,"I had to look him up, and now that I have seen... it, I agree. Even John Merrick looked better.

Is he a man? Is he a drag queen? Trans woman? What the fuck is with the makeup and who in the fuck out there thinks that is hot?"
6750,2020-09-05 21:05:32,in10mc,"I looked at this, thought ""who is that?"" 

Googled. Regretted. 

That was absolutely repulsive, and I dont think anyone actually thinks he's good looking, they're just trying to he trans positive and supportive. 

Its physically IMPOSSIBLE to find that attractive."
6751,2020-09-05 21:42:52,in10mc,"James Charles isn’t ugly though to you, is he?"
6752,2020-09-05 21:54:37,in10mc,"So I totally hate you right now- well, you and google.  I agree 100% that this  person is ugly btw.  Like wtf??!  I didn't know who Jeffree Star is.  Now my phone thinks I am a newly minted fanboy dammit.  Apparently I needed incognito mode to google a person :("
6753,2020-09-05 21:56:40,in10mc,He looks like he was created in a lab by gay ai 1000 years in the past about what they thought wed look like in the 2000s
6754,2020-09-05 22:02:21,in10mc,I had to go look up who that is... What's that condition called when you keep getting plastic surgery because you still don't look right and your view of yourself is really fucked up? I'm pretty sure he has that
6755,2020-09-05 22:05:17,in10mc,He claims he doesn't do any drugs except smoking weed. I suspect he's either lying or he gets liposuction at least once a month
6756,2020-09-05 22:06:17,in10mc,I feel this way about Greta thornberg
6757,2020-09-05 22:08:30,in10mc,No way this stays up
6758,2020-09-05 22:17:23,in10mc,"Isn’t he a trans tho?
Or she?"
6759,2020-09-05 22:30:18,in10mc,"I really hate all of these beauty guru people. They are all fake just like the makeup they use to hide how they really look.

Its basically all those real cringy drama people from high school theater just continuing their petty attention seeking and manufactured drama.

The worst part is the fans of these people. They will attack you just as bad as k-pop fans if you speak ill of whichever clown faced Frankfurter wannabe they bade their lives around."
6760,2020-09-05 22:32:41,in10mc,I’m so glad someone else thinks this and said this. I think people are afraid of saying anything due to fears of being labeled intolerant/sexist/anti-trans/anti-whatever else
6761,2020-09-05 22:38:33,in10mc,"Had to Google it, since I had no idea what it was and yeah - you're right 😂"
6762,2020-09-05 23:04:45,in10mc,"He looks... extremely bizarre and ugly I guess, seeing as he probably has drug trafficking operations, this could be because he would be hard to find and arrest after the decision's in the making, as he could change his appearance with relative ease."
6763,2020-09-05 23:07:16,in10mc,i also though he was a girl. you can identify as anything nowadays and i am confused
6764,2020-09-05 23:18:28,in10mc,Who's Jeffree Star?Seriously.
6765,2020-09-05 23:20:09,in10mc,"The ugliest part about him is that he associated with a child molester.  He called him a child molester, publically - and then a year later, went on tour with him.  Hung out with him.   made YouTube videos with him.  Made more songs with him. 

And then earlier this year when he talked to Chris Hansen, he was more interested in “setting the record straight” and cleaning up his own reputation, than owning up to the fact that he continued a friendship with someone WHO HE KNEW was molesting children

I am willing to forgive past bad behavior, but befriending a child molester?  So he made some nasty bigoted comments.  That’s one thing, and bad enough.  Befriending a CHILD MOLESTER is below any acceptable form of human behavior I can think of 

Fuck Jeffree Star"
6766,2020-09-05 23:20:17,in10mc,I think it's all that drama that he constantly surrounds himself with that makes him so unattractive.
6767,2020-09-05 23:20:19,in10mc,He looks like a gremlin alien
6768,2020-09-05 23:20:28,in10mc,As someone who’s met him personally(check my profile) he is terrible to his fans.
6769,2020-09-05 23:20:44,in10mc,He's ugly inside-out.
6770,2020-09-05 23:20:48,in10mc,"I've no idea who this is. Just googled him.. 

Look at this _cunt_, wow."

6772,2020-09-05 23:22:58,in10mc,I had to look *it* up. Yeah it's ugly.
6773,2020-09-05 23:23:55,in10mc,everything that reaches hot in r/unpopularopinion is a popular opinion

6776,2020-09-05 23:25:40,in10mc,Agreed I had to close my tab after looking him up so I didn't scare myself again when I opened my hrowser back up
6777,2020-09-05 23:25:48,in10mc,Who looks like a ghost
6778,2020-09-05 23:25:55,in10mc,Jeffree Star reminds me of that weird trans lobster villain from the powerpuff girls.
6779,2020-09-05 23:25:59,in10mc,He looks how i would imagine a demon to look
6780,2020-09-05 23:28:40,in10mc,"His personality is atrocious. I hate these bandwagon hate trains, but I don't feel as bad given how he treats others."
6781,2020-09-05 23:29:26,in10mc,This is an unpopular opinion? Even my friends that like Jeffree think hes gross

6783,2020-09-05 23:34:51,in10mc,He looks scray

6785,2020-09-05 23:35:26,in10mc,He's just a weirdo
6786,2020-09-05 23:35:51,in10mc,He looks like a fuckin alien
6787,2020-09-05 23:36:25,in10mc,He looks like a walking mental illness

Those are the only two I think are kinda cool. Forget that. Whats the deal with that old boyfriend of his? He was a straight  guy, then he wanted dick? I mean it doesn’t work that way ..unless you’re Bisexual. ( That means you like men and boys)That  was odd. So let's say since he’s not with Star anymore and a new girls going to suck his dick andthrn what? Fukin  taste what Jeffrey shit out for lunch a year ago? Eshhh, My point is I don’t get the attraction. Unless it’s money but still I’m not blowing a guy for a new car, that's all I'm gonna sat. Ok carry on."

6845,2020-09-06 04:07:18,in10mc,I have more issues with his racism and the pattern he has of paying people to be silent or say things and manipulate people.
6846,2020-09-06 04:18:26,in10mc,The guy looks and acts like an anime villain
6847,2020-09-06 07:10:38,in10mc,"Tbh I love his look. I just like odd looks. But his personality is a dumpster fire and that ruins his entire weird look for me. Like I’m mostly about who people are on the inside & that makes them attractive to me. But when your personality is a dumpster fire it makes you as a person hideous, too."

6897,2020-09-06 02:22:24,in10mc,I don’t understand how this isn’t in the same realm as black face. It’s literally dressing up as an exaggerated depiction of the male ideal of a woman. I’m not saying people shouldn’t be allowed to do it but I see no difference.

7004,2020-09-05 15:11:49,in10mc,His “music” is also garbage.  I heard a few “songs” of his back around 2008.   He had a parody of that song that does “dontcha wish your girlfriend was hot like me”.   It was awful.   Just straight up ripped off the actual music/beat and he was totally tone deaf.  More like talking and less like singing.   Like I couldn’t believe he actually had money.   It sounded like some poor ghetto kid in highschool who is a SoundCloud rapper
7005,2020-09-05 16:57:39,in10mc,He reminds me of one of those freaks in the capitol in the hunger games

Its not like judging his natural appearance- he chooses to look like that, and puts a ton of effort into it.

Just like you can judge someone's tattoo, I think its fine to judge his looks (also his tattoos look awful, and way over done).

And yea, seems like a shite person"

I never understood the slides either, I think they were only for a joke, since Shane loves to tear slides in general, ig they thought to get him the most expensive slides out there lol. I guess it’s funny because it’s just such an unnecessary product? Shane is so gross tho (morally and physically), he wears sweat stained shirts with holes and like food stains on them. Nasty."

7098,2020-09-05 18:32:17,in10mc,"This is discussed within the community itself, but a lot of drag is not parodying womanhood in a derogatory way, and a lot of drag communities support and uplift women. Also, many, many drag queens are thankful to the women in their lives to inspire them to love make up and unabashedly be themselves. 

That being said - there is a large discussion on the fact that a lot of drag stuff does come from culturally black known stuff, and if drag is “stealing” that culture - I’m white so I’d say I can’t comment on that. But it IS a big contentious discussion, and if black people are saying some things make them uncomfortable, I definitely want to listen (but even among black people it’s a divisive issue).

Those things are talked about within the community itself, and drag has evolved. Shows now aren’t the same shows 10+ years ago."
7099,2020-09-06 00:17:44,in10mc,"Drag used to be kind of misogynistic, but it’s gotten better over the years - it’s pretty common for drag performers to not wear fake breasts now, say. 

And the vast majority of popular drag queens really aren’t doing it to be insulting, they’re doing it as an art form, and they often deliberately go for androgynous, subversive aesthetics - Violet Chachki is one of my favorite drag performers and she often goes for a very small, compressed waist, very feminine makeup, and then an undeniably male chest, when she’s doing aerial performances. And you have bald queens who don’t wear wigs, like Sasha Velour, and very muscular queens like Milk, and queens like Yovska who mostly look like vaguely feminine horror monsters, and so on.

Drag isn’t about the enforcement of social roles, it’s about subverting them."
7100,2020-09-05 18:19:10,in10mc,"Black face is making fun of a minority, has a history of being used in messed up ways whereas drag is more as fitting into the stereotypical “gay” thing and using tons of makeup; most drag people you don’t look at and think “that’s a woman in a lot of makeup” it’s more “that’s a man in drag/emulating stereotypical woman”"
7101,2020-09-05 22:20:22,in10mc,blackface is satirical
7102,2020-09-05 15:59:05,in10mc,"Weeeeeelll, ya see, drag is satire and an art form. It’s to be enjoyed by anyone, especially women because it’s funny to see ourselves pushed to extremes and we like to make fun of ourselves sometimes. And to compare it to blackface is like comparing the n-word to midget. They just aren’t equal in that way."
7103,2020-10-05 01:44:09,in10mc,No. Drag is not intended to negatively make fun of women unlike black face
7104,2020-09-05 18:34:20,in10mc,"He’s a man, but he doesn’t care about pronouns. He isn’t trans, he just likes to wear whatever."
7105,2020-09-05 15:16:36,in10mc,"he doesn’t care what people call him, he’d probably be fine with “it”."
7106,2020-09-06 00:51:39,in10mc,"I’m not a fan of the guy but if you don’t know someone’s gender surely calling them ‘they’ would be the first instinct, you know? “Wait, they’re a he?”

You probably didn’t mean anything by it though. Just some people deliberately go for the ‘it’ word choice to suggests someone’s not a human or their more of a monster/creature/animal.

Edit: someone got offended by my comment so they downvoted. Weird"
7107,2020-09-05 22:45:19,in10mc,Agreed. Thats just bullying. Why cant people just address his viewpoints and personality?

7110,2020-09-05 18:28:50,in10mc,"Trust me I haven’t seen anyone from the LGBT community support him, lol"
7111,2020-09-05 20:35:04,in10mc,Nah I’m gay and hate him.
7112,2020-09-05 19:13:50,in10mc,"Hes hardly super insecure, that sounds like you projecting."
7113,2020-09-06 01:50:59,in10mc,"Eh, i dont know if they’re insecure but I do agree this reaction is what they go for definitely. I mean I’m not a fan of the Jeffree person but I understand they’ve built their own career from scratch and were at one point signed to Akon’s record label before quitting music and starting their makeup business (I just looked at their wiki page is all)

So I gather they’re another entrepreneur/influencer/selfmade celebrities or whatever you want to call them...but regardless of their title I get the impression you’re right that they go for shock value and the negative publicity is what they feed on. So basically in line with Kim Kardashian type celebrities or most modern rappers and stuff"

Ftfy"
7169,2020-09-06 00:48:50,in10mc,"I can’t relate either but I also can’t relate making your comment to ask whether we could imagine doing so. OP did what they did & you can do what you like to do. The premise of this sub is unpopular opinion and they posted their unpopular opinion.

I think you either misunderstand the purpose of this sub or you’re a huge fan of Jeff who will always defend them...but whichever of those two reasons it is I don’t think you need to announce that you can’t relate to the original poster or remind them Jeff doesn’t care about their opinions.

Imagine how sad that would make OP feel? That would make them feel this little 👌 but I agree Jeff doesn’t care about their opinions which is why they wasn’t directly messaging Jeff and instead they were telling the subreddit. I mean likewise we could say Geoffrey doesn’t give a shit about your opinions but that would be hella hurtful to you perhaps.

Overall, I can’t relate to OP but I think being understanding is better than yelling that you cannot relate. If you can’t relate, why not ask OP why they posted so you can relate and understand rather than belittling them or assuming they’re commenting due to being jealous of Mr Star. I don’t think they made this post with malicious intentions or they personally hate Juh-Free, I think they were just opening up discussion.

Anyway, your other comments also seem a bit belittling with the passive aggressive or sarcastic ‘hun’ but regardless I try to be the best that I can be so hopefully my comment maybe connects to you in some kind of way ❤️🤘 rock on Birbygal hehe"

The very 1st thing I saw was a video J* had posted of himself bullying his mother until she cried.

At first, I thought it was a skit. Lots of people made weird, scripted skits back then; I thought, at first, that it was the beginning of an offensive skit. Tasteless, but fake.

As time passed, it became apparent that it was not a skit. He was sitting in a chair, while someone else did his hair and makeup. There were 2 other people in the room with him, the cameraman and some guy in a corner. That was why I originally thought it was fake: it seemed inconceivable to me that all of those adults would engage in 8th grade-style lunchroom bullying. But there was no way that her reaction was fake. No one is that good at acting.

I clicked off of his page, and never looked back. Since then, footage I didn't personally witness has surfaced: J* behaving in racist ways, behaving in misogynistic ways, and it all seems pretty in- character for the vitriolic person I witnessed all those years ago. 

Some fans might say that he has 'addressed' his relationship with his mother, and I will rebut that now. In 2018, J* released a video titled 'Revealing my Last Dark Secrets'. At 13 minutes in, he 'reveals' that he has not been on very good terms with his birth mother for a long time, and how they became estranged over the years, and how the person he referred to as his mom in social media was actually his aunt. This video was obviously intended for his new, young, post-MySpace audience that was never exposed to the video footage of him bullying his mother. He very carefully does not detail anything that he might have done wrong; he never admits that he bullied her with his friends, filmed it, and then posted it online for strangers to view for attention. He just spends a lot of time talking about his own pain, and spinning a narrative for the audience. He says things like, ""I thought to myself, wow, she might have remarried by now. She has her own life. I could have stepsiblings!"", because he thinks that this is a demonstration of empathy. If he were truly empathetic, he would have thought to himself, ""Why would my mom rather be homeless for years than reach out and ask me for help?"" He has not demonstrated an ability to engage in true self reflection or personal growth, he is content to be a bully for the rest of his life. 

His physical appearance has nothing to do with why I dislike him. His nefarious deeds would fill tomes."
7247,2020-09-05 22:51:26,in10mc,">Could you tell me what has he done that shows a bad attitude/personality? I know a few 'fans' and just don't know enough to talk about him.

For me it was when he referred to his former friend (James Charles) as a child predator, [he sent him some horrible texts](https://i.imgur.com/SUgHs60.jpg). Shortly thereafter, he tweeted at James' brother and asked him ""Why is your brother a child predator"".

Then despite James ignoring him after all that time, he (Jefree) recently tweeted to commend him on some video James did. So not only was it bad enough that the levied terrible, false accusations against James....he commended him recently which just goes to show that he *knows* they were false accusations and is trying to be buddy-buddy with him now. 
 
 
Jeffree is a cancer is more than a 100 different ways."
7248,2020-09-05 23:06:56,in10mc,He’s called Jackie Aina (black beauty influencer) a gorilla and a rat. Claimed he wanted to throw battery acid on a black woman to lighten her skin tone. Worked with and called out a pedo (Dhavie vanity) but continued to support him. Shared revenge porn multiple times. Much more but liam mcevoy has a video that goes over most things he’s done.

7250,2020-09-05 20:42:24,in10mc,There was the racist tweet thing a year or two ago. I generally don't like the art holier than thou tone s/he uses. Being means and rude to fans is also a nono
7251,2020-09-05 23:37:48,in10mc,"A LOT. Jeffree Star was famous in the Myspace era of the internet 2003-2006ish? He was famous for being a horrible person, racist, sexist, chasing people calling them the n-word, he's been recorded stomping on teenage girl's heads while wearing high heels on stage (he used to be a ""singer"" if you can even call it that) , he was friends with a confirmed pedophile by the name Dahvie Vanity and only turned against him when Dahvie personally offended him.  

JS also tried to start a makeup brand called Lipstick Nazi back in the day and tried to have it scrubbed from the internet but people still found evidence of it (JS had the brand name copyrighted and there are screenshots of the old website)  

JS is friends with Shane Dawson, a known racist who built his youtube career off minstrelsy (black face, and not the fun kind like in Topic Thunder, literal actual minstrelsy), Shane has a long LONG history of racism, pedophilic content, beastiality content, describing in explicit detail how he'd like to murder people (women mainly) on his old podcast. Not to mention describing in detail how he raped his cat when he was 19. JS is best friends with this person.  

A couple years ago JS posted a youtube video called ""RACISM"" that was supposed to address his past, but he never once actually apologized for being racist. He avoided it by saying things like ""I'm so sorry for what I said"", ""I was in a dark place"" (P.S. If you're in a dark place, and you lash out at people with racism, it means you're racist. Like. That's when racism comes out.)  

I could go on but all the evidence you need is one quick google search. It's all out there in the open for anyone to know."

7260,2020-09-05 20:41:12,in10mc,Exactly. A better way to describe him would be as a dude who got extensive shitty plastic surgery in order to look like an elf but ended up looking like an alien with a ton of makeup.

7283,2020-09-05 20:01:24,in10mc,"I don't care for him, never heard his music.

But i just wanted to say that being tone deaf does not make someone incapable of making music.

Roger waters ( member of pink floyd, some call him the diving force behind it) is tone dead and needed people to tune his bass/guitar for him, he also sung a lot with pink floyd and his voice is pretty good."

I don’t like shaming people for their makeup styles as I think makeup is an art, and both art and attractiveness is subjective. Yeah, he has all that other objectively bad, problematic shit about him. Why go after the one thing that isn’t when you have plenty of shit to drag him on?"
7291,2020-09-05 15:02:19,in10mc,"Because someone else out there looks like he does but probably doesn’t do all the shit, and the look is shared. Go ahead and attack people don’t deserve it, but people will treat you like an asshole for being an asshole🤷‍♂️"

7294,2020-09-06 01:13:04,in10mc,"Yes but he “apologized” and said he’s changed, so his fan base believed him... and then he called a black youtuber the n word."

[Here’s a Youtube vid](https://youtu.be/IdGWdWE7-k8) detailing all of his shenanigans. It’s long but thorough. 

But the TL;DR of it all, he loves using the N-word a whole lot. One of those times he used it in reference to another (black) youtuber who criticized him, and that was *after* he had apologized for using it in the past. He also has made offensive comments about Mexicans and has referred to black women as gorillas and rats."

I meant putting my bias aside, his eyes fit what would be classed as attractive by most, the social norm if you like, with the smoky mascara etc. Very model like.

As opposed to my personal/subjective opinion that his eyes look like that of a ghoul haunted by its own image.

I meant objective as in putting my personal preference aside.

Same way I can admit Marilyn Monroe is commonly accepted as being attractive while I find her rather repulsive. She reminds me of a mouse."

The thing with Shane is that I didn't mind his era of making obscene cakes or microwaving Barbies and shit. It was vapid, but it was ok. Then I really got into the crew dynamic at first, with him, Ry, Morgan, Garrett, and Andrew (and sometimes Drew Monson.) The spooky boys stuff and the crew going to, like, the Queen Mary. Still vapid and overly dramatic, but it felt like a nice, fun crew of misfits hanging out together. Didn't even mind the Graveyard Girl series; kinda liked it in fact. But then it started going south for me, quickly. The reason the GG one was fun to me was that the whole crew went and had an adventure. But then came Tana, Jake, and Jeffree, and all I could think is: Why are you trying SO hard to make us sympathize with these trash people? I watched part of the Jake Paul one thinking it was actually going to be an exposè, and it wasn't. I wanna have fun, not sit there and watch Tana fake cry. The fact that he posts an installment and then edits the rest based on fan reaction says it all. Make a documentary or don't - but stop trying to sway and manipulate the story in various ways through editing and your inability to present things with impartiality. I ended up feeling bad for Kati Morton, as I'm 99.9% sure Shane's editing did her dirty, especially in the first installment of the Jake Paul series."

And the ‘not traditionally attractive’ part of your comment seems to implicitly agree with them too by admitting the drag queens aren’t attractive.

As for me personally though whilst I don’t want god to forbid unattractive people from becoming performers, I do have to wonder why do people become performers if they’re not attractive...I don’t follow the world of drag but I was under the assumption that the appearance of the performers was the main focus.

7383,2020-09-05 23:19:28,in10mc,Yeah but jeffree star isn't the only person in the world to look the way he does. You're insulting everyone who looks like that by doing this

Why are we nerfing the world by suggesting it's wrong to place a subjective value(express preference) on someone's appearance... based on their appearance? OP literally concludes that Jeffree Star's appearance is not appealing... and cites Jeffree Star's appearance.

This song sounded like he just hit play and then sang into a cheap webcam mic and that’s it.    It just sounded cheap.  I don’t know how else to explain it.

He did get called out by Tati for allegedly trying to seduce straight guys among other things, but a lot of her allegations were proven false. Tati is trying to do a lot of backtracking at the moment, saying that Shane Yaw and Jeffrey Steininger (their real names, fun fact) manipulated her into posting the ""Bye Sister"" she made, which was over 40 minutes long and went into all of those allegations.

There is, however, an alleged voice memo from another influencer claiming James sexually assaulted them, the person in the memo.

I think the breaking point with Shane for me was also when he became friends with these problematic people. “Guys please I’m not racist!!” *surrounds himself with racists*. After all the exposes, he became so disingenuous in my mind. In his past apologies for example, he was asking people to forgive him, “apologizing”, then in his newest one he said that he was just saying that to cover his ass and that they weren’t genuine. So how are people supposed to believe that your new apology is genuine? 
Admittedly, I wasn’t ever really a huge fan or anything, I didn’t follow him and would watch him sometimes, but I was fine with him. Now I really dislike him, I feel bad for the people who used to feel comforted by his videos. I can imagine how they feel now."

7526,2020-09-06 01:35:57,in10mc,"An illness isn’t bad..? I agree it shouldn’t be looked down upon but I still think it’s bad.

I do understand what you’re trying to say though but here are a few things: 
• According to the American Psychiatric Association, Gender Dysphoria and Gender Nonconformity are *not* the same thing. So a big difference is gender dysphoria involves clinically significant distress. 

So on that point I think by the looks of it I think Jeff may not conform to gender norms but I don’t think they have the whole distress thing or desire to transition which gender dysphoria people have. (From what I understand the gender dysphoria distress is part of the reason behind higher rates of suicide among trans folks & the identity issues and the desire to have their distress assuaged by transitioning their gender..so it’s a bit like a chicken & the egg thing..is their transgenderism a caused by the mental distress/mental condition or is the mental distress caused by being transgender..or is it both, you know?).

• Also there’s some debate and some constant change with the whole classification of gender dysphoria. I’m just looking at the Wiki page now but it used to have disorder in its name until 2013, until it was renamed with DSM-5 because of the stigma and misleading suggestions that calling it a disorder could have. But even in the years after 2013 there’s still debate among trans folks, researchers and other people over whether the condition should be recognised by psychiatrists at all or whether it’s made-up in order to stigmatise gender nonconformity (not too dissimilar to how homosexuality used to be recognised as a mental disorder by DSM).

• Lastly I also want to make clear that gender dysphoria as a mental condition is only recognised, given a name & legitimised by the American Psychiatric Association & their DSM manual. So it’s still the sorta thing where the APA are just one voice of authority here rather than *the* voice of authority..or they try to give a general, fair & unbiased guide for psychiatry and mental disorders...but theyre still not immune to criticism or making mistakes and there are still many other organisations, researchers, psychiatrists & experts who disagree with them.

Edit: why has this been downvoted? I wasn’t arguing with the person I was spreading info🤦‍♂️😂. I think a lot of words makes you guys afraid and you autodownvote...because there’s no reason to downvote here, dummys"

It doesn't help that Jeffree has a long repeated history of racism and misogyny (racism and misogyny that he hasn't actually apologized for), and thought that an acceptable way to deal with a young rising threat to his company, would be to partner up with other pieces of shit Tati and pedophile Shane Dawson, and accuse James of false accusations of coercing men into sexual acts. Don't defend Jeffree Star. He is a monster, not only doing many horrible things himself, but also defending other awful people like Shane who have had similar histories of racism."
7529,2020-09-05 23:24:16,in10mc,"Not directly though. I doubt most people would actively care since it's not saying ""all people who like Jeffree Star"". Its just a post on the internet at the end of the day."

You’d think it would dispel their racist notions, but a lot of times it just confirms them (see, if this black person can assimilate in whatever ways I’ve deemed appropriate, and act how I expect them to act, why can’t those other thugs!).

7615,2020-09-05 18:44:42,in10mc,"I know, but I feel a bunch of people will still defend him, no matter what (not even necessarily lgbt people) because hes gay, so they dont come off homophobic, which is dumb, but that's how it is a lot"
7616,2020-09-05 19:39:20,in10mc,"I know he had a few old songs floating around but my point was that he is/was a huge name in the online beauty guru community. I think most people who aren't fans will know him as the make up guy not the singer. 

I am used to seeing make up on men, or I was before covid shut down my local drag night, I just find him scary looking. It's not even just the make up or the lack of eyebrows,  its his expressions, tone, mouth, hand movements, general demeanour. I know it's mean and he's a shitty person inside so I'd rather talk about that, but i scream inside whenever I see him. Genuinely find him to look like a disturbing creature i just dont say it cause most people who don't like his look are homophobic and I'd rather not associate with them.

In my head I'm thinking ""I watch beauty videos it's cause  wanna look like them (or at least try)"" and i don't get why anyone would wanna look like him. I question his make up taste. 

This is just my opinion though, doesn't really matter."

Still, it was a rural area, not a lot of young people to hang out with and only one or two spots to meet, so we eventually clashed got to know each other and it was all good, the idiotic thing was those dudes were still racist to everybody else and on the other hand would fuck someone up for saying racist shit to some Turkish friend. It was kind of a bizarr situation. They even offered bringing in their guys to beat someone up for you if you got problems at school or whatever, so you had a Black dude getting backup from a bunch of skinheads that were like, ""yeah we hate everybody that is not white, but Kemal right here, that dude is the best"".

I mean everything we say could offend someone or could be something they disagree with. This isn’t a new concept or anything to panic over though because we’re all humans so we take into account people’s intentions rather than just their actions before condemning them."

I couldn’t understand what you meant with your original examples but I still believe & trust that you saw transphobic comments and you’re not making it up.

Having no eyebrows + being rail thin and having an overall unhealthy appearance is universally unattractive. I can tell you as a matter of fact, no normal neurotypical human being finds him sexually attractive from a purely physical standpoint. It’s unnatural to find universally unattractive traits attractive.

Obviously attraction is a confusing thing and some people may find themselves physically attracted to him considering his personality, wealth, etc... but from a purely physical standpoint he’s horribly off putting to any normal person."

Baby Boomers 1941-1959 (first to enter school after WWII ended to last being born in a United States with less than 50 states)

Gen X 1960-1978: First to be born in a United States like today to last graduating college in the 20th century

Millennials: 1979-1997: First to graduate college in the 21st century and the last to spend four years of college on campus

Gen Z: 1998-2016: First to graduate college remotely and the last to be born before Trump was president

Millennials: 1984-2001: First to graduate high school after 9/11 and the last to experience a traditional high school graduation

Gen Y: 1980-1998 (first 80s borns to last who can possibly remember 9/11)

Gen Z: 1999-2017 (first who can't possibly remember 9/11 to last who can possibly remember pre-COVID 19 world)"
7907,2020-09-01 17:28:39,ikfnvk,"True. Even though I wouldn't argue for this organization of generations, I still liked reading one possible interpretation of how certain years could be grouped together."
7908,2020-09-02 00:03:49,ikfnvk,"I know that, but I actually like this generational grouping. Makes all generations 18-19 years is very balanced, compared to making it very short as 15-16 or less years or making it very long like 21-22+ years. It makes things easier for everyone else instead of all this confusion. But at the same time, this is all arbitrary. I know that we are not really millennials at the end of the day, especially based on how society views millennials and such, but maybe being a millennial is different to another person. Just my two cents."

7910,2020-09-10 23:10:09,ikfnvk,What's wrong with that? I was just listing a bunch of celebrities born around that time.
7911,2020-09-01 07:43:39,ikfnvk,"I dont think ""first who cant possibly remember"" or ""last who can possibly remember"" something are good markers to mark a generation. I mean it is very likely a three or four year old would not remember the political importance of these events. They may not even know who this Kennedy is until like years after he died. 1961 might have memories prior to Kennedy's death.  I am sure many 1959 and 1960 borns would not remember Kennedy's death. Many 1995-1998 dont even remember 9/11. 2015-2017 though can end up remembering a world before coronavirus 15 years from now, even though they may not know what coronavirus is.

7912,2020-09-01 07:52:21,ikfnvk,"Not bad. It's just shifted over four years earlier.

Instead of this:
Boomer: 1946-1964
Gen X: 1965-1983
Gen Y: 1984-2002
Gen Z: 2003-2021

It's this:

7913,2020-09-01 07:58:57,ikfnvk,"The 1961-1979 and 1980-1998 definitions aren't that uncommon actually. Many people want to begin gen y at 1980 since it's the first 80s year, so whenever they also apply the 18 year span, it ends up being 1980-1998. You barely ever see 1942-1960 and 1999-2017 though."
7914,2020-09-01 08:09:10,ikfnvk,"I prefer the ranges next to: instead of this rather than its this. Makes no sense for 1960 to be gatekept from the other two early 60s years. You even said 1980 should be start of millennials since it is the first 80s year. First half of the 60s is gen jones anyways. 

I have seen 1945-1959 as a baby boomer definition. 

Then 1960-1979. 

1980-1999 is one of the most agreeable millennial definitions I have come across. It is my favorite actually. 

I am not keen on when Gen Z ends though.

I have seen 1998-2016. Never 1999-2017 though. People would prefer stating X in 1960 if 1964 or 1965 is too late, since the first three years of the 60s are the full early 60s years, just like how you said 1980 should be y as it is the first 80s year. People prefer 1982 over 1980 as the millennial start date though."
7916,2020-09-01 08:01:55,ikfnvk,"First of all, I have never seen 1961-1979 and I seen 1942-1960, with the exception of 1942, so 1943-1960. I have seen 1980-1998 (though I feel that most start Y in 1980 cause it is the first 80s year like ending it in 1994 or 1999 for the same numerical reason. I have seen 1999-2017 in a way, maybe excluding 2017, so 1999-2016."

7920,2020-09-01 03:24:47,ikce9l,"As a pale person with a pink undertone, generally it's the undertone that is the issue. The yellow/gold base is a problem. Cover FX does the right sort of tone. Tartes shape tape concealer is great, the foundation is a different tone/color which doesn't work, but I have used the concealer as my foundation a lot, it is also high coverage. For tone corrections I have used everything from drug store to Urban Decay and they are much the same. It's a matter of practice. Same goes for contouring, best to go with a cool brown, kinda brown with grey neutral undertone with no shimmer then practice until you get it."
7921,2020-09-01 06:06:00,ikce9l,"The new colourpop pretty fresh foundation (not the tinted moisturizer) goes super light! The swatches don't look very light on the website, but trust me, they are pale. I'm mega pale and the lightest shade is several shades lighter than me, which I've never come across before! They also describe some shades as warm or yellow, but really their entire line is quite neutral or pink. It's also medium coverage (buildable to full) and slightly dewy, It's only $16 too, it's available at ulta but limited shades, better selection on colourpop's on website."
7922,2020-09-02 00:26:11,ikce9l,"Korean brands tend to carry extremely light shades, because a lot of people like to go a shade lighter to fit the beauty standards. I use the Etude House Double Lasting Serum Foundation (about $20). Try the shade Rosy Pure."

7924,2020-09-01 03:06:33,ikce9l,I really know nothing about makeup but I’d say try out fenty. I’ve only ever heard good things about it and they have a great range of shades - even for pale skin.
7925,2020-09-01 06:52:27,ikce9l,"To contour, use taupe shades. I haven’t actually contoured in years but at the time, I used the NYX blush in Taupe. I am super pale and red too. Lol. Rose Ivory in the Wet N Wild Photofocus foundation has been my closest match ever."
7926,2020-09-01 20:54:18,ikce9l,"Hello fellow pale person! 

I don't use foundation, but these are bullet proof for me:

Rimmel Eraser for under eye. 

Laura Mercier Secret Camouflage concealer in 01. It comes with two shades, to ensure you match both under tone and skin tone. It has full coverage on spots.

Becca shimmering skin perfector in Vanilla Quartz.

Kevyn Aucoin Sculpting Powder in Light.

Benefit Gold Rush as a sort of bronzer.

Clinique Superfine liner for brows in soft brown is the perfect Ash colour."
7927,2020-09-01 03:25:02,ikce9l,I will! Thank you so much :)
7928,2020-09-01 03:27:41,ikce9l,I've heard a lot about the Tarte Shape Tape before but I wasn't sure if I should splurge. I think I'll give it a try though :)
7929,2020-09-01 07:07:34,ikce9l,I'll have a look! Thank you so much :)
7930,2020-09-01 07:07:23,ikce9l,Thank you! I'll have a look at those. I remember liking the WnW Photo Focus foundation but found it a bit too yellow on me in porcelain.
7931,2020-09-01 03:28:57,ikce9l,Ulta will have it 50% off in their 21 days of beauty sale so look up when and get it cheaper :)
7932,2020-09-01 05:52:46,ikc6en,I wanted to stop in to say you have very beautiful face features.  I especially love your cheeks.
7933,2020-09-01 16:33:17,ikc6en,your eyes are so pretty 🥺
7934,2020-09-01 02:53:11,ikc6en,"Looks good! But I can barely see the blush. :( Is it the soft peachy tone? 
Also, for the lips, I would personally follow the natural curve of my lips just so it looks a little less pointy on the bow. :)"

7936,2020-09-01 02:59:15,ikc6en,Oh! The blush is nice for a subtle touch. Your look is reminiscent of an everyday no-makeup makeup look as it is. :)
7937,2020-09-01 02:07:33,ik841p,Omg!! Remember when Shane puts that technology to the test about 1 year ago in a conspiracy video? Around the same time as the Chuck-E-Cheese videos. I never understood why he’d be interested in the voice altering software.... but this might explain it
7938,2020-08-31 22:54:56,ik841p,"I'm watching that video now too. 

Honestly I agree, that's kinda what I've thought the whole time"
7939,2020-09-01 00:27:04,ik841p,"Tbh this is believable but I also kinda think if its what happened that maybe  the person told them, but didn't ever text it so they faked it. 

I'm sure it will all come out one day there's no way it won't."
7940,2020-09-01 02:41:10,ik841p,I hate how this isn't even a huge reach because they've proven to be jealous over james to the point of tryna ruin his career before lmfaoo. This is the kinda theory shane would believe and post if it wasn't about him
7941,2020-09-01 07:36:09,ik841p,The problem with this is the fact that Blair messaged the person in the tape. If they duped somebody’s voice then the whole ruse would be up since she sent a message.
7942,2020-08-31 23:10:58,ik841p,"I’m not quite sure I follow on this one. It’s either one of James past “boyfriends” (the waiter, or the Coachella guy) or Grayson. 
It makes more sense to me that James pushed a boundary with Grayson rather then the other two that have already been proven to be liars. It would also explain the text Jeff sent James as well."

7945,2020-08-31 23:49:17,ik841p,Can you link the video?
7946,2020-09-22 12:15:20,ik841p,"My initial thoughts were that it was someone who was intoxicated at J*’s place, and he socially engineered the conversation, then once the victim opened up, J* recorded it (possibly without consent).

But the more this fuckery continues, my current thought is that it’s one of the Dolan twins, and the reason why it sounds like it’s the middle of the conversation is because he was getting coached by J*, SD and the other twin as to what to say, so they didn’t start recording until he’d picked up some steam, and sounded more “victimesque”."
7947,2020-09-01 06:09:00,ik841p,I honestly think it is grayson on the tapes.
7948,2020-09-03 23:00:21,ik841p,I put nothing past that disgusting creature named Joffery syphilis
7949,2020-09-25 18:39:21,ik841p,Sooo I love this. But I thought Jeffree secretly recorded the victim and that’s why he never said who it was (I think it’s one of the Dolan twins) bc he legally could get in trouble so secretly recording someone.
7950,2020-09-26 12:27:03,ik841p,Oh I agree. First of all we have proof that Shane has access to this technology.  Second like...who makes their sexual aaaualt allegations through a voice memo? Isn't it usually through text? This is the theory that has made the most sense so far.
7951,2020-09-30 17:22:36,ik841p,my god.... never thought about that but it’s too coincidental that sd knows how to use that tech and all j* has is a voice note. who uses voice notes anyway? i always thought it was suspect that he had a recording in the first place instead of screenshots or a video.
7952,2020-09-30 20:27:24,ik841p,I totally agree. My guy friend owns an escort business where men tend to hang up if a man voice answered the phones so he used a voice changer to sound like a woman. It tripped me out how you couldn’t tell at all
7953,2020-10-01 05:30:48,ik841p,Yea. Shane is a pretty decent actor so he could easily make it seem legit with a voice changer
7954,2020-09-01 12:33:41,ik841p,"I've heard this before and in my eyes it's to far fetched.
A voice memo dose exist however do I think what was said in that voice memo was true? NO 
do I believe that the context of what may have been said in the voice memo was twisted to fit a narative? YES"
7955,2020-09-06 05:38:28,ik841p,"that would b fucked up but also it would fire back if the youtuber in question found out and I just think it's impossible that by now they haven't been contacted by someone who listened to the audionote. I honestly believe it was real, just maybe taken out of context?"
7956,2020-09-21 14:26:55,ik841p,There is actually someone who accused james publically but it never got any coverage for some reason. Repzilla on yt has a video on it (i was too lazy to finish the video so i have no idea how credible it was)
7957,2020-09-21 17:51:27,ik841p,Can I get a link to this video?
7958,2020-09-21 18:06:00,ik841p,"The voice mimic technology doesn’t work without someone knowing. You have to feed the software sentences for it to mimic the voice. 

So the person would have to say these sentences for it to be used as a text to speech with that persons voice."
7959,2020-09-22 08:05:27,ik841p,Never thought of this but sounds like it could absolutely be correct.
7960,2020-09-22 22:42:32,ik841p,That is crazy and yet it’s plausible.
7961,2020-09-23 19:01:46,ik841p,You know it was ————right?  You completely ignored the fact that Blair White also mentioned that she actually got in touch with the YouTuber to see if their okay/ check the credibility.
7962,2020-09-25 22:41:01,ik841p,Interesting topic🤔
7963,2020-09-26 08:12:34,ik841p,"Not possible. That technology requires that you say a certain script. It takes about an hour, and it has you saying the top few thousand most common words so it can formulate a base reference point. Even then, it would sound off, because people in real life pause, they say filler sounds (um, ah, hmm, etc.) and can’t necessarily get your cadence and inflection right. Especially if you’re trying to make the technology talk about something very serious, and you were in a happy or more neutral mood when you recorded the script."
7964,2020-09-30 09:45:49,ik841p,"Real or fake (my bets are on fake), on both accounts JStar looks like the bad guy. If its real, then he's stressing this victim out with the threat of being publicly outed and outing them to their coworkers (fellow YTers). If its fake, which it most likely is, he's not only a liar but could and most likely would face legal charges. If this is the case, I'd kill to be a fly on the wall during conversations between their lawyers."
7965,2020-09-01 05:30:57,ik841p,Honestly surprised nobody has put this out there before . That was the exact line of thinking I had while watching his video.
7966,2020-09-01 18:58:27,ik841p,"I believe they would do that but, in Shane’s video where he tried out the deep fake thing, didn’t the voices sound really fake? I feel like I remember that they didn’t sound like a person really talking"
7967,2020-09-12 00:12:13,ik841p,What is this referring to? Someone update me
7968,2020-09-21 06:52:03,ik841p,"so Blair said it's a large youtuber, who would they claim to be then? who did they tell her the recording was of?"
7969,2020-09-21 22:53:10,ik841p,Ok but didn't Blair or Tati say that she reached out to the alleged victim before making the video where she speaks about the voice memo ? In that case the victim would probably have said something if that recording was fake.
7970,2020-09-24 23:39:49,ik841p,i wouldnt be suprised at all if Jeffree did this but also the technology isn't *that* great or convincing
7971,2020-09-25 05:17:10,ik841p,I dunno. This seems a little far fetched and extreme
7972,2020-09-26 01:16:10,ik841p,Bingo. 👏🤝👍
7973,2020-09-26 16:54:28,ik841p,Oh wow
7974,2020-09-30 01:20:09,ik841p,[Is this the video you are referring to?](https://youtu.be/nF0Nxv40Nr0)
7975,2020-09-30 01:29:40,ik841p,"I honestly think Grayson, especially with all the girlfriend videos by him lately. He knows he could get dragged in."
7976,2020-09-30 02:12:28,ik841p,The victim actually exists but he was the one who approached James Charles. He’s a minor. But he told James Charles that he was 18 that’s when he accused James of being a predator. The wrong thing is how Jefferee used this as a weapon to bring down the competitor. If that tiktoker boy came out with the video early on then the drama would not have escalated. Maybe Jefferee was manipulating the boy not to speak up. The timing was too perfect because the boy only started to speak up when Jefferee started getting cancelled. It was in spill sesh video I’m not sure if it’s still up but I’m not going to reveal his identity in the comments
7977,2020-09-30 14:52:20,ik841p,"If this were true, all hell would break loose"
7978,2020-11-23 23:57:45,ik841p,"This is a really cool theory, and it's totally possible.. but I just don't think so. The reason is bc Grayson Dolan's name was thrown around so much during all of that and he never came out and said like ""no that didn't happen"" or anything. And it's like.. okay perhaps he wanted to avoid the drama but then he proceeded to hang out/collab with Jeffree like right after everything happened. I'm not saying the allegations are true, I'm not even saying that I THINK they're true.. just saying that I do believe Jeffree has a recording of Grayson. Imo ofc."
7979,2020-11-24 15:21:30,ik841p,"Its Grayson. His name was released, then removed by Sebastian Williams, who was told the name by Blair."
7980,2020-11-24 17:57:11,ik841p,"Damn, why am I interested in this?"
7981,2020-09-01 12:51:41,ik841p,Exactly what I was thinking!!
7982,2020-09-30 13:19:25,ik841p,Is there a video?
7983,2020-08-31 22:56:49,ik841p,Glad I’m not alone!!
7984,2020-09-01 12:52:07,ik841p,"😂, damn that’s too real"
7985,2020-09-06 09:07:26,ik841p,"Just curious but what proof? If you’re talking about Tati’s video, I wouldn’t consider that proof especially since she’s a known liar"
7986,2020-09-30 13:54:26,ik841p,He has tho. In his chuck e cheese video he talked about voice ai technology and even did an experiment with it
7987,2020-10-01 05:00:44,ik841p,"The ""you don't like me it's because you're jealous"" theory is so middle school as you can get. That's not how the *real* world works."
7988,2020-09-01 12:55:21,ik841p,Definitely a good point — and I’m not trying to argue with you.  But I don’t remember: did she say they’d ever gotten back to her?
7989,2020-09-29 23:16:03,ik841p,Pffpftpf like she's some kind of beacon of truth.
7990,2020-09-30 00:26:18,ik841p,It could easily just be a throwaway number or account connected to an assistant or the YouTube's themselves
7991,2020-09-01 07:22:02,ik841p,"I honestly still think that JC and Grayson hooked up/fooled around, and then Grayson had ‘gay panic’ about it and spread the story to J* that he was coerced to get ahead of it getting out."
7992,2020-09-30 17:43:32,ik841p,"didnt sebastian williams make a video where he said he had 'exclusive tea' and revealed that it was grayson who sent JS the voice note (and if I recall correctly JS did say in a text that grayson was gonna make a video exposing James during part one of dramageddon) but then he got backlash for it since grayson himself didnt come out and say it and sebastian had no right putting it out there before him and calling it tea so he apologized and edited it or took the video down I'm not too sure but I remember seeing this.

edit: just read the other comments and someone already mentioned this. please ignore my comment lol sorry"
7993,2020-09-21 19:47:14,ik841p,"Everyone has told a lie, you can’t brand someone a liar and make everything they say invalid forever. Imagine being 19 and having the world agree that you are now invalid because you did some childish shit. Have more empathy mate."
7994,2020-09-22 22:46:56,ik841p,Yeah that is really uncool. If that voice mail was real then whoever it was called JS as someone safe to confide in and then he goes shopping it all around just to prove that JC is a bad person.
7995,2020-09-01 12:54:06,ik841p,"YEP.  After coming to terms with my own sexual abuse, I’ve only told a handful of people in my life — best friends and some partners (bc I felt they deserved the heads up about possible triggers).  I didn’t tell ANYBODY whom I felt might spill the beans to someone I either didn’t know or didn’t trust"
7996,2020-09-01 00:25:41,ik841p,"https://youtu.be/BHLBaOASC74

I believe it was in this one"
7997,2020-09-23 22:15:25,ik841p,Could have been recording the entire time and just cut it.
7998,2020-09-01 15:10:28,ik841p,Wasnt is Sebastian williand that came out and said it was?
7999,2020-09-01 18:16:38,ik841p,I do too. I think james did something to make him feel uncomfortable but whatever it was was taken and blown up to fit a way worse narrative. Both can be true.
8000,2020-09-25 18:50:30,ik841p,"Also completely plausible!  (And probably what actually happened; I just like wearing my tin foil hat, 😛)"
8001,2020-10-01 14:47:45,ik841p,"I mean, he tricked tens of millions of people into thinking he wasn’t complete garbage, 😂"
8002,2020-09-01 12:56:10,ik841p,"Oh ABSOLUTELY.  If the voice memo is actually real, then it was definitely doctored to fit their narrative"
8003,2020-09-07 05:41:39,ik841p,"Tati did say it was a piece of a longer conversation. I do believe jeffree records people, it was brought up in the Rich Luxe vs Luscious drama, on how Rich allegedly records his calls with Jeffree."
8004,2021-01-07 08:51:16,ik841p,"If you’re talking about that TikToker he allegedly sent nudes to, I think the story is bull for this reason: he said he went to the authorities and they were building a whole ass case and everything... and then radio silence. No case, no drama, nothing. Additionally, if you were really doing all that, you don’t just publicly say it. 

My best bet: Jeffree gave it another go through him using different claims but he screwed it up."
8005,2020-09-22 01:38:09,ik841p,Ditto!
8006,2020-09-22 14:24:34,ik841p,"Which one?  The D’Angelo video, or the one where Shane talks about this tech?  Happy to link whichever you want!"
8007,2020-09-21 21:13:51,ik841p,They can get it from videos of that person (if he is a youtuber that’s easy)
8008,2020-09-23 21:48:32,ik841p,"I did hear that.  I didn’t want to include that rumor because I don’t feel like it’s fair to talk about someone *by name* who hasn’t come forward themselves to say they were victimized 

It wasn’t my intention to “ignore” that she reached out to the alleged victim, because I don’t remember her saying whether or not they ever responded"
8009,2020-09-30 11:38:02,ik841p,"THIS

And omg the amount of times I’ve wished to be a fly on the wall for his conversations with lawyers, 😂"
8010,2020-09-01 19:25:36,ik841p,I thought it sounded like a slightly garbled recording — which would still come off as plausible in the context of it being a voice memo
8011,2020-09-30 01:34:11,ik841p,Yep!
8012,2020-11-24 00:18:41,ik841p,Yes video!!
8013,2020-09-06 13:54:25,ik841p,"The event last year where tati was mad about some dumb shit and made it seem even worst by accusing him of sexual harassment. When it was debunked shane justified it by saying james needed ""a slice of humble pie"" 

And how this is at least the second time Jeffree has claimed hes a predator, likely just to get involved in a trending topic. On top of all that I heard the original incident happened when James was getting close to passing Jeffree's followers, if thats true I wouldn't be surprised if that wasn't a coincidence and he was genuinely upset over it."
8014,2020-10-01 21:53:21,ik841p,"I mean, sometimes it is. Adults can still be childish, jealous, hateful, and petty. But also, yes, some who never want to do the work of actual growth throw it around when people actually clearly have good reason to dislike them, too."
8015,2020-09-01 15:43:19,ik841p,"I don’t think Blair said that they had ever gotten back to her, but I think that would still expose everything because the victim would know what jeffree had done."
8016,2020-09-22 12:19:41,ik841p,IIRC they left her on read.
8017,2020-09-01 12:26:20,ik841p,"This sounds about right. If James had truly knowingly assaulted someone and Jeffree was told this and believed it to be true, why the hell would Jeffree apologise to James in his video? I don’t think anyone would hold it against Jeffree for not apologising to a predator. I think Jeffree either made the whole thing up, or someone else did and he ran with it."
8018,2020-09-01 13:44:10,ik841p,"I think Gray and Ethan have some serious toxic masculinity problems and don’t get that being gay doesn’t effect masculinity, there are masculine gay men and those like James and drag queens who prefer wigs and makeup"
8019,2020-09-04 14:50:29,ik841p,"Sebastian Williams tweeted that it was Grayson but got shut down because if he really is a victim and is not ready to come forward, outing him isn't really nice."
8020,2020-09-21 19:49:23,ik841p,"Lying about sexual assault can literally ruin people’s lives. A 19 year old is an adult. These are fully functional people. These aren’t white lies. That, and both these men came out with videos apologizing. Let’s not pretend they didn’t lie, but instead celebrate the face that they came clean instead."
8021,2020-09-01 13:46:41,ik841p,"Plus Jeff was running it around town like some hot tea, look what I have !! I’m gonna ruin JC ( imagine it in the bellatrix la strange voice cause that’s how I hear it) 

If it was real, surely he would have asked Jeff to not say it and send the voice memo to blaire and heavens knows who else"

Omg I’m really stoned right now, I’m sorry!!

Here’s the Tati video:

8034,2020-09-01 13:17:04,ik841p,"Exactly.  If he was really assaulted, then he deserves that story to stay private unless *he* wants his audience to know about it.  So it’s disgusting that this was paraded around and weaponized in front of **millions** just to ruin James’ career — since now everyone (including myself) is speculating about this"

8038,2020-09-01 19:57:50,ik841p,"I bet that is true! If Gray was perhaps interested in knowing how to hook up with a guy, surely James would also be encouraging him/ giving tips whereas I can see jafar taking advantage of that and using him"
8039,2020-09-21 19:53:47,ik841p,What petty lie are we talking about ? I feel like you’re talking about a specific point that I have not thought of. I’m speaking on the Sexual assault/ predator accusations.

8041,2020-09-01 15:22:11,ik841p,"Completely possible!  I don’t like James one bit, but I’m not going to consider him guilty of anything like this until a victim comes forward themselves and shows decent evidence that this happened"

8051,2020-08-31 12:34:50,ijttr2,"I was reading your post history and you say some very helpful things consistently. I feel that it’s more difficult that I am completely aware of what is happening yet am unable to avoid it. The person I last ended up with has left me feeling phobic of love and relationships for the first time in my life. The relationship I was in previous to that was almost a decade long and while he wasn’t the best partner to me (porn addiction, running away etc) it didn’t leave me traumatized to this extent - in fact when things ended with him I was excited to meet new people and still wholly believed in love. Now I have nothing but doubt. I’ve never had a good track record when it comes to choosing guys, but even the physically abusive relationship that I was in when I was younger did not traumatize me in this way because the signs were _very_ clear. This time the mental and emotional manipulation and gas lighting and convincing me that it’s my fault (basically what my own parents put me through) has left me reeling from the mere idea of love. I too feel like I can trust no one. It really takes away all hope from you once you’ve experienced this - especially when in the beginning he came across as the best thing I’d ever experienced. I thought all the pain I’d ever been through in my life was worth it in the end because he was the light at the end of a very dark tunnel. Little did I know at the time that it was the beginning of an even deeper, darker, longer tunnel. I will forever be suspicious of men who come across as amazing. If everything is going too well. I hope that I’ve learned enough signs by now to know what to avoid but I worry that I’ll miss them initially.


Some things to avoid: 

1. If they were abused my parents (mine was - and physical childhood abuse can cause BPD... his mom is a narc for sure but he excuses her now for want of a relationship with her, despite the fact that she has completely fucked him and his siblings up). Troubled relationships with family is a huge avoid for me now just to be sure. 

2. Financial irresponsibility. He’s in extreme financial debt but excuses it. Comes across as having many goals but never fully achieved any of them. Lots of talk. I never before dismissed a potential partner because of financial reasons and in fact have always been willing to help and have always believed in working through things together. But now I realize that this is a big red flag.

There are other more nuanced signs that I won’t go into that have more to do with situational gauging. But those are the big two that I will avoid from now on."

8129,2020-08-31 01:37:46,ijlim6,My bottom 3 is the exact same as yours. Top 10's pretty different but I respect your opinion.
8130,2020-08-31 03:55:23,ijlim6,Damn i really like dead in ditches sad to see it at the bottom.

***Get the fuck outta here***"
8132,2020-08-31 04:35:21,ijlim6,This doesn’t seem like a real ranking. It just feels like you ranking every album and then ranking every song on every album and just slapping it down like that
8133,2020-08-31 02:53:09,ijlim6,Well damn you really dont like swan songs
8134,2020-08-30 23:08:22,ijlim6,I think they've evolved and gotten better as time has gone on. And agree to disagree
8135,2020-09-02 06:40:41,ijlim6,You like Jeffrey Star that much? lol
8136,2020-08-31 00:59:42,ijlim6,I really really hate Swan Songs
8137,2020-08-31 01:07:09,ijlim6,Thank you! And exactly! Just my opinions
8138,2020-08-31 08:11:07,ijlim6,"Oh really? That's awesome man! Which one outta curiosity? Bad Moon is so fucking awesome. And thank you, man! I appreciate you not jumping all over me. I knew a lot of people would be pissed off but I was making this because it's been on my mind for a minute."
8139,2020-08-31 01:39:57,ijlim6,Not gonna lie Another Level has a banger instrumental during the first 2 verses.
8140,2020-08-31 20:15:51,ijlim6,"What do you mean? He went through every song and listed them best to worst, its a very well put ogether ranking."

8142,2020-08-31 01:39:03,ijlim6,"I'm not the biggest fan of SS either. I like Undead, Everywhere I Go, City, Young and Paradise Lost but that's it."
8143,2020-08-31 01:04:26,ijlim6,"Damn I fucking love it man, that and day of the dead are my favourites. AT and NFTU also contain loads of bangers. Five and Empire not so much, still great records regardless"
8144,2020-09-01 06:56:58,ijlim6,Thank you. I worked on it for like 3 days. I just have a wildly different opinion than people
8145,2020-08-31 03:54:06,ijlim6,I like most of the SS songs. But those which you said are my favs too
8146,2020-08-31 02:57:12,ijlim6,"Yeah I understand, compared to the rest of their other material they can be a bit of a hit or miss for fans. Id say deuces departure definitely played a roll in them changing their style/sound"
8147,2020-08-31 03:53:46,ijlim6,"I feel Swan Songs didnt age too well at all, they have so much better stuff now"
8148,2020-08-31 04:40:02,ijlim6,THANK YOU!! THAT'S THE POINT I'VE BEEN TRYING TO MAKE FOR YEARS

8159,2020-08-30 16:00:48,ijezns,Why don’t you get some single shadows in a similar colour story. That way you know they fit in a z palette and won’t line the pockets of him?
8160,2020-08-30 16:13:31,ijezns,"Yeah that’s exactly what I was starting to think! I never bought single shadows before so it didnt cross my mind right away, but I just thought 30 eyeshadows is WAY more than I need!"
8161,2020-08-30 23:52:25,ijezns,"Good idea. That makes me think of the makeup geek matrix neutral palette. Definitely worth a look, and you can buy your preferred colors as singles. I've got 6 in the new square pans and they're all excellent"
8162,2020-08-30 19:28:54,ijezns,A lot of the shades in that palette are very similar and you won’t necessarily see the subtle differences on your eyes when it’s blended out so I reckon you could easily cut down the amount of singles you need to buy. Also not sure where you’re based but Colourpop do really good singles and have quite a variety so I’m sure you could find some that matched the palette? Maybe looking on YouTube or Instagram and seeing if someone has duped the palette themselves and look at what choices they use instead?

8166,2020-08-30 15:33:19,ijb5b0,"I'm interested to know what kind of medical attention they get post-accident. Does the ER team vigorously rub their forehead? I could understand CPR screwing up liquid lips, but I've heard it's no longer mouth to mouth? What part of an accident aside from head trauma would mess up their makeup? 

Crying makes sense too, but only for mascara, right? 

Someone please educate me on the ways of wonderous forever staying makeup and what trials entail during an accident that would actually touch a person's eyebrows, my 20k boyfie can only afford an airhead."
8167,2020-08-30 15:32:03,ijb5b0,"People be like: My both arms are broken, I am in coma, but my eyebrows are f**** flawless ;)"
8168,2020-08-30 14:21:37,ijb5b0,"Oh yeah???? Well I was hit by a car WHILE giving my 20k a sneaky gobby, so I can verify that my lipstick is both blowjob proof AND car crash proof. This is important information to put in a review because of how many other people will undoubtedly be in the same situation. 

I think in all seriousness, the makeup sphere has become so oversaturated with sex stuff (everything was kiss proof, which is nice to know, then it was blow job proof) that it isnt shocking enough anymore. If you eat a massive burger or suck a massive dick and your makeup stays put, that's not going viral anymore, no one cares. Serious bodily harm? Buzzfeed is for sure going to write about that, which means other people will start using that as the fucked up yard stick with which they (publicly) measure makeups performance, because it gets attention."
8169,2020-08-30 17:43:07,ijb5b0,This makes me want to write ridiculous reviews for make up in weird situations “this lipgloss saved my life as I wrestled a gator in the swamp. I thought for sure it would’ve slipped off in the muggy waters. But nah bitch it stayed on! Lost an arm though.”

8173,2020-08-30 20:39:38,ijb5b0,"I guess if there was blood/mud/grease on your face, someone would wipe it off to be sure there weren't any abrasions underneath, but it would have to be quite a crash to end up that messy."
8174,2020-08-30 17:39:44,ijb5b0,"If I go into a coma and can't do my brows, they better call in an emergency microblader so my brows stay looking full!"

8243,2020-10-09 17:16:44,j80mls,How KVD of him.
8244,2020-10-09 23:31:34,j80mls,what a shit name
8245,2020-10-09 16:34:08,j80mls,"Magic Star sounds so bad. Like you makeup for kids. (No offense to toy makeup, I used to love them as a kid)"
8246,2020-10-09 17:20:57,j80mls,"It's the concealer, but clicking on the logo doesn't lead to the concealer page. It really doesn't make sense to me that they would put the product name as the main logo without it actually being a campaign or anything. 

if it's not a mistake or they just haven't gotten the links working yet or anything like that it might actually be them ramping up to a kvd kindness vegan and discovery name change? 

If true, that is cheer-worthy in itself because it means the fucktrumpet has become so goddamn unpopular that they have to remove his name from his brand and I can just IMAGINE how his narcissistic brain will deal with that."
8247,2020-10-10 03:41:30,j80mls,jeff wants us to know he luvs black people ❤️
8248,2020-10-10 15:17:33,j80mls,I think a rebranding might be coming. The domain magicstarcosmetics.com was registered on 2020-10-09. I did a whois lookup.
8249,2020-10-10 01:20:56,j80mls,All of this and he still has that shitty logo
8250,2020-10-10 05:05:02,j80mls,"Kindness Vegan Discovery? No, this is Jealous Sexoffendor Criminality. (allegedly)"
8251,2020-10-09 17:08:28,j80mls,"Does the images look like glory h*les.No, just me and my filthy mind?"
8252,2020-10-09 18:08:58,j80mls,[he tweeted this tho](https://i.imgur.com/rbYeAd7.png)
8253,2020-10-09 21:19:15,j80mls,have they changed it back now because i am not seeing a magic star logo just the regular one?
8254,2020-10-10 01:20:45,j80mls,Bastard is trying to avoid bringing his company down with his scandals.
8255,2020-10-09 20:53:53,j80mls,Polish a turd it’s still a turd
8256,2020-10-09 21:44:44,j80mls,Did he or does he actually own either of this brands?
8257,2020-10-10 09:00:52,j80mls,magic star sounds like makeup you'd find at Claire's
8258,2020-10-10 11:33:42,j80mls,Did he just pull a 🌱✨Kat Von D Vegan Beauty✨🌱 kinda thing?
8259,2020-10-09 20:21:07,j80mls,"It looks like they are going for a rebrand - based on the imagery and the name/logo, but it's done REALLY badly if it is (they should have done the whole site before launching and have ""magicstarcosmetics.com"" be the address redirecting from J*cosmetics.com, that magic star domain isn't even owned by him). Honestly if it is for the concealer, he needs a new marketing agency. If it isn't and is for a rebrand he REALLY needs a new marketing agency. 

Disclaimer - I wasn't on his site before so perhaps he's always had terrible web design and marketing?"
8260,2020-10-09 16:01:03,j80mls,Look at the blatant tokenism...has to have 3 black folks on the splash page.
8261,2020-10-09 16:13:28,j80mls,"Very interesting. If j* cosmetics is rebranding and j* is out of the picture, I’m trying to decide if I would finally try something from the brand."
8262,2020-10-11 22:15:00,j80mls,JSC Beauty has entered the chat.
8263,2020-10-09 20:22:31,j80mls,"i am convinced people who currently buy from JSC would no longer purchase anything if he gets booted out of the company. jeffree is a vile person and you know what they say, birds of a feather flock together."
8264,2020-10-09 16:29:38,j80mls,Putting some distance between the brand and a problematic owner is a good business move. Wanting what is a successful business to be able to survive without being propped up by a single person is a good idea. I’m interested to see how they move the brand away from him. Because as awful a person as I find J* I don’t actually enjoy seeing businesses go out of business since it always impacts so many people that social media doesn’t see. And for all intents it does seem like the brand treats their employees pretty well.
8265,2020-10-10 06:01:40,j80mls,"Thought I was on the circlejerk subreddit, but... nope this is real holy shit ahahaha"
8266,2020-10-10 12:31:42,j80mls,"Following in the footsteps of his ex-friend Kat Von D, I see."
8267,2020-10-11 07:43:47,j80mls,"I'm late but wow today I literally thought ""what if jaffar had to sell his makeup brand? Would it just be star cosmetics?"""
8268,2020-10-10 06:42:33,j80mls,"I think he's just highlighting his face products currently and that's the concealer and setting powder names.  All of the slides that go by, the ""shop here"" button goes to the face products. if anything i bet he's coming out with magic star foundation."
8269,2020-10-10 07:37:21,j80mls,As a web developer this guys site absolutely hurts my soul. He has the money to pay for a fantastic revamp (would only cost like $1000 for how little content he has).... and it would improve his conversions significantly enough to far offset the development costs.
8270,2020-10-09 20:08:00,j80mls,He’s gonna sell the company in 5...4...3...2...1
8271,2020-10-09 15:39:51,j80mls,"Wait, this is actually really smart... 😐"
8272,2020-10-10 02:56:13,j80mls,Yet I still can't afford a lipstick
8273,2020-10-09 17:40:29,j80mls,And using POC for advertising... he’s desperate !
8274,2020-10-09 17:55:03,j80mls,He’s rebranding; pulling a KVD
8275,2020-10-09 16:27:29,j80mls,HE SO PATHETIC!!!! I wish he would just go AWAY!
8276,2020-10-09 19:10:29,j80mls,"He’s gonna sell it. Yes, I know about the concealer."
8277,2020-10-30 08:54:45,j80mls,Im sure this is promo for his powders or some old website version that probably gets activated sometimes. would be a smart move if he did remove his name from it with all the negative mentions going around. He never sells out anymore
8278,2020-11-15 14:59:19,j80mls,"not likely he will rebrand himself now that the business is established. The ""magic star"" is just his unique setting powder"
8279,2020-10-09 16:07:50,j80mls,My favourite magic star face is |:>
8280,2020-10-09 19:57:39,j80mls,">a chocolate marketed primarily at kids

How dare you, I will literally still be eating magic stars when I'm 80."
8281,2020-10-09 17:38:12,j80mls,Not only in the UK and I want them so bad rn lol
8282,2020-10-09 23:17:15,j80mls,Magic Stars is also off brand lucky charms!
8283,2020-10-09 18:04:09,j80mls,i unironically stan magic stars
8284,2020-10-10 09:40:03,j80mls,"""I'm not a racist! Would a racist choose to share a brand name with something ""chocolate*?""  
- Jabron Stork, probably"
8285,2020-10-10 11:29:51,j80mls,Yeah my first reaction to this news was how dare he skidmark all over my favourite chocolate
8286,2020-10-11 10:18:04,j80mls,Oh my God they look so cute! My favorite is the B)
8287,2020-10-12 17:35:27,j80mls,Oh damn it's been a minute since I had those. Completely forgot about Magic Stars.
8288,2020-10-09 15:09:24,j80mls,Maybe he's selling his own brand like Kat von D did!
8289,2020-10-10 01:49:24,j80mls,His recent launch was for the shade extension of his magic star concealer and setting powder. Been promoting it like mad. I’m sure he’s launching a magic star foundation shortly
8290,2020-10-09 17:37:20,j80mls,"I looked on my phone and you can see the star logo but not ""magic star"""
8291,2020-10-09 15:32:28,j80mls,because thats when he peaked
8292,2020-10-09 15:35:42,j80mls,He looks like he's from 2005 so he's matching his website 😂
8293,2020-10-09 15:12:05,j80mls,Ah I didn’t even realize it’s the name of his concealer. You’re probably right!
8294,2020-10-09 15:16:23,j80mls,Apparently it's also the name of his new powders.
8295,2020-10-09 15:35:36,j80mls,"I think you're right, I remember the magic star concealers."
8296,2020-10-10 01:48:28,j80mls,Omg always thought his website looked janky as fuck. It’s probs because he’s releasing the announcement for his magic star foundation tomorrow
8297,2020-10-09 15:52:09,j80mls,"Jeffree has a business partner behind the scenes (The guy who played Chunk in the Goonies in the 80s. Jeffree couldnt afford to start a cosmetics company on his own and needed and investor) Jstar himself only actually owns 49 or 50% of Jeffree Star Cosmetics. Maybe he was outvoted or sold his shares to his partner.

Edit: autocorrect turned Chunk into Chuck"
8298,2020-10-09 16:50:14,j80mls,It would also be weird since the j’s are still in the star logo
8299,2020-10-10 00:33:05,j80mls,"All of the ""face"" category on his website are ""Magic Star"".   


Apparently there are new (maybe? no clue) powders that are also Magic Star.. so you're probably spot on."
8300,2020-10-09 18:31:31,j80mls,That’s a good theory!
8301,2020-10-09 19:29:53,j80mls,"Oooh, good catch! He's isn't even the focal point of the single picture he's in.

I'm sure he'll still release the green palette soon, but I don't think it can possible save his company's future. Especially since his last three palettes were not selling great, and lip liners and concealer flopped too. Add to that new wave of racism criticism, SA revelations and ""BF"" mess...

ETA a word"
8302,2020-10-10 20:52:21,j80mls,Yes usually when you have to sell your business The lawyers will suggest you take your name off it as you don’t wanna sell your name
8303,2020-10-09 17:03:11,j80mls,"I’m not sure. But at the very least I would no longer judge people who do purchase from his brand.

I am currently hard core against JSC. I’m a black woman and highly offended by Jeffrey’s past / current behavior. I found his “apologies” to be meek, and insincere. And he clearly uses black and brown people as props for his image. The picture in this thread proves that. 

However, I’m also a person who leans towards an alt / gothic aesthetic. And JSC products have appealed to me. I think his packaging is great. And despite the cremated palette coming out at the absolute worst time, I liked the concept. I also like the concept of the Orgy palette. 🤷🏾‍♀️ neither of those palettes were executed great, but they were imo good ideas. 

And I’ve gone back to limecrime after Doe Deere left the company. I purchased their velvetines well before I knew of their controversies. But now that Doe is gone I figured it’s okay to go back to my favorite product. So if I can buy limecrime I’d be a bit of a hypocrite to continue to judge consumers of a JS free JSC. 

So if JSC was completely devoid of JS.... I probably still wouldn’t buy it. But at least my stomach would no longer churn at the site of his products on my Instagram feed. 


Edited to add more thoughts."
8304,2020-10-09 17:40:50,j80mls,"I honestly couldn't make that decision until I saw what the final result was - I'd be open to buying from KVD Vegan Beauty because it feels like there's now a degree of separation between Kat and the brand, but JSC is so closely tied to Jeffy that there's barely any distinction. I'd need to see the changes and evolution of the brand post-Jeffy before I reevaluate my stance."
8305,2020-10-09 20:35:31,j80mls,"I used to buy from him. His matte formula is great but his shimmers are very hit or miss. And I mean like there's 2 that I really like - the dark green shimmer in the alien palette and the blood red shimmer in the blood sugar palette. The others are lacklustre. Since I stopped buying JSC I've found other brands that do colour, with mattes as good or better than his, and shimmers that are much much better. Can I recommend Kaleidos and Glamlite both - the latter has cheesy packaging IMO, but their product is well worth it."
8306,2020-10-09 22:52:14,j80mls,"Doubtful. It's not really my style, I'd never go through all that product, and I'm not sure I'd ever fully trust he wasn't behind the scenes somewhere, somehow."
8307,2020-10-09 17:03:23,j80mls,"No, people who I trust have said his products are very overrated. The looks I see on others are bad imo. There’s not been many pictures shared that sell the products to me."
8308,2020-10-09 17:10:03,j80mls,"Probably not. I don't own anything from J*, but I did like *some* of the formulas and colors he had. Some of the highlighters and liquid lips are beautiful, but I've found some amazing dupes so I don't feel like his products are so unique anymore. The other reason I probably wouldn't buy them is that tbh his packaging sometimes feels tacky/gaudy/cheap and the weirdly sexual names combined with that are just not for me. That was fun when I was a teenager, but I'm an adult woman now. If something is going to have a weird name, it better have some nice packaging."
8309,2020-10-09 23:16:37,j80mls,"fuck yeah, if he didn't profit from it at all anymore. it would be exactly what i've been hoping for, because he has great chemists despite having bad taste elsewhere. i'm really tempted to get something like the extreme frost from the green collection coming up secondhand, but knowing him, it'll be weed shaped things and not worth depotting..."
8310,2020-10-09 16:54:38,j80mls,"Personally, yes. A lot of the products are great quality, I just refuse to give him my money."
8311,2020-10-09 19:08:33,j80mls,"I smelled one of his liquid lipsticks that a friend owned and it legitimately smelled like cat piss, so no. I have better liquid lipsticks and my cat pisses all the time for free."
8312,2020-10-09 19:09:33,j80mls,I wouldn’t because I’m allergic to something in the eyeshadow formula. It makes my eyes puffy and itchy. Also the products are overpriced.
8313,2020-10-09 19:10:07,j80mls,No.
8314,2020-10-09 17:30:26,j80mls,Not if it's still shit.
8315,2020-10-10 02:17:14,j80mls,"Probably not, I find the packaging and naming of the products to be pretty tacky."
8316,2020-10-10 05:11:57,j80mls,This needs to be top comment
8317,2020-10-10 04:57:03,j80mls,I thought I was the only one
8318,2020-10-09 19:20:29,j80mls,But he also said in his snap (or insta story; saw it on twitter) that he would announce some very big news soon besides new launches. One can only hope...
8319,2020-10-09 16:17:55,j80mls,Noooooo. Please let this brand crash and burn 🔥
8320,2020-10-09 17:34:49,j80mls,mine is :@
8321,2020-10-09 21:05:55,j80mls,ah the Minecraft villager face

8323,2020-10-09 21:20:30,j80mls,Oh dw I'm almost 30 and I polished off an entire bag (not a small one) in one sitting earlier this week. Magic Stars are top tier.
8324,2020-10-10 08:14:49,j80mls,I don’t think they taste as nice as they used to. :(
8325,2020-10-10 09:03:10,j80mls,Same!
8326,2020-10-09 18:22:18,j80mls,"Ooh I didn't realise you can get them in other countries! I grew up in France and only discovered them when I moved here, am an addict now"
8327,2020-10-09 15:12:54,j80mls,"That’s what I was thinking! Someone else pointed out it’s the name of his concealer though, so it might just be to promote that :/"
8328,2020-10-09 16:20:22,j80mls,"He can't sell something he doesn't outright own. I'm wondering if the two majority owners of his company bought out his minority stake in it, and are trying to distance themselves/the business from it."
8329,2020-10-09 17:33:02,j80mls,[removed]
8330,2020-10-10 19:34:04,j80mls,I hope so. The only reason I buy KVD now is because I know it isn’t lining her pockets. I love the liquid lip Plath and haven’t managed to find a good dupe for it so I went without for years until she sold her company
8331,2020-10-11 04:29:17,j80mls,Two years ago he patented the foundation name and it is apparently called mannequin foundation. Maybe he was going to launch it with a summer date but is postponing it because of all the drama

8338,2020-10-09 16:47:21,j80mls,"I really don't think this information is correct. I'm just quickly googling here and it looks like Jeffree's business partner is Jeff R Cohen an attorney. Chunk from Goonies is Jeff B Cohen, also an attorney. Jeff R Cohen is the one linked to Jeffree, not Chunk. They have completely different photos and education history and jobs."
8339,2020-10-09 17:13:41,j80mls,It’s not the same Jeff Cohen...the owner of Jevfefe’s company is an attorney. Not the actor. Don’t do Chunk dirty like that!
8340,2020-10-09 16:19:14,j80mls,He actually has two- hes' a minority owner (less than 10%) of his own company. The two people who own the majority of the business have been revealed on here before.

8346,2020-10-09 18:49:20,j80mls,thank you!
8347,2020-10-10 00:39:28,j80mls,"Maybe I'm confused about a gothic aesthetic.. aside from some of the palettes, is his line gothy? His line always gave me like ""Edgy"" Paris Hilton more than Goth.

There's those concealers (maybe?) and lip liners that seemed very sailor moon wand esque. Mostly everything else is just pink or tacky."
8348,2020-10-10 00:52:37,j80mls,"I'm with you on preferring the goth/alt look and debated for awhile of purchasing some of the KVD line now that Kat isn't involved anymore. I have done same with Limecrime for first time and damn those Velvetines are real nice liquid lipsticks.

I'm still unsure if I could ever by JSC devolved from JS himself. So much of that brand is based around him and i just want nothing his paws were ever in."
8349,2020-10-10 04:58:10,j80mls,unless they release an eyeshadow palette with a color story I need I probably won’t ever buy from JSC even if J* is completely out of the brand. it’s tainted for me.

Just something to consider."
8355,2020-10-09 16:24:06,j80mls,"Here’s the thing though, if he truly has nothing to do with the brand anymore and he isn’t making a profit from my purchase, it kinda really makes me want to support the brand for doing the right thing and getting rid of him. Granted I’m sure it’s because his bad publicity was tanking sales, but still, getting rid of problematic CEOs is something that I want to support."

They made my eyes water and it was terribly uncomfortable. I finally just threw them out. I already wasn’t going to support the guy anymore but I figured I would pan what I had.

Hello, your recent post on /r/Snapchat has been removed because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines in the ""Rules"" section of the sidebar.

This is the proper way to format a title -> *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, W, T, A, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. You must have a hyphen between your [R4R] and your title.**

**6. If you are posting about /r/Snapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject. instead of your age and [R4R].**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Snapchat/submit?sidebar&title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

Loona tv and now their self-edited Loona Logs are a great way to get to know the girls.

8401,2020-10-08 20:51:19,j7iqj1,"Hi and welcome!

I'd say just jump in the the OT12 individual MV's, I feel they all perfectly capture the mood and styling of each girl. Then the three main sun-unit MV. Basically take it as a rich lore narrative steeped in art history symbolism, each compliments the next, and then dive as deep as you feel is necessary. The Loonaverse runs deep, but I wouldn't say it's necessary to understand in order to fully enjoy LOONA at their core ☺️

Oh and [Cherry Bomb](https://youtu.be/s7kxoMYg3l8) dance cover 👌🏻. For many outside of Orbits, that put LOONA firmly on the map as an all-round powerhouse group"
8402,2020-10-08 21:05:13,j7iqj1,"pardon the copy and pasting from another of my comments but this took me so long to type haha. this is mainly a guide to the subunits/ debut process. 

hello!! r/loona would love to have you, we have lots of fun over there :) 

loona began by having each girl have a solo debut. the order of release is:

heejin - vivid (b-side is an acoustic mix)
hyunjin - around you (b-side is i’ll be there which also features heejin) 
haseul - let me in (b-side is the carol which features heejin and hyunjin) 
yeojin - kiss later (b-sides are my sunday which is sung by heejin and hyunjin, and my melody which is sung by yeojin and haseul) 

after those four debuted solo, a sub-unit was announced, which is called loona 1/3. the subunit would include three of four of the already debuted girls, plus one more. yeojin is the only member of loona who is not part of a subunit, and no one really knows why. she is considered to be a part of 1/3, but never promoted with them. 

loona 1/3 debuts with heejin, hyunjin, haseul, and vivi as the members, but they debut as a subunit before vivi debuts as a soloist. the first mini-album is called love & live and the repackage is called love & evil, which adds a few songs to love & live. 

after promotions for loona 1/3 are over, vivi debuts as a soloist. her title track is “everyday i love you” in which haseul does a rap verse. her b-side is “everyday i need you” which features jinsoul.

the next three members debut solo. their songs in order of release are:

kim lip - eclipse (b-side is twilight)
jinsoul - singing in the rain (b-side is love letter, which is a duet with kim lip) 
choerry - love cherry motion (b-side is puzzle, a duet with jinsoul) 

the second subunit is then revealed to be called loona odd eye circle, and includes kim lip, jinsoul, and choerry as the members. their mini album was titled mix and match, and the repackage is titled max and match. 

next the last four members debuted. in order of debut:

yves - new (b-side is d-1)
chuu - heart attack (b-side is girls talk, a duet with yves)
gowon - one and only (b-side is see saw, which is a duet between chuu and gowon but also features kim lip) 
olivia hye - egoist (b-side is rosy, which features heejin) 

finally, the last subunit was revealed to be called loona yyxy. (pronounced yy by y, and short for youth youth by young) their mini album is called beauty&thebeat and there was never a repackage. 

finally, after all twelve girls had debuted, they released a pre-debut single titled favOriTe. immediately after the release of that, teasers for the their first mini album [++] were released. their other mini albums are [xx] and [#]. 

it’s a lot! and there’s a lot of history that is easy enough to find but not essential for an introduction. the loonaverse is also incredibly interesting, but not my area of expertise. it’s a theory that all the music videos are connected and there is a whole storyline to go along with their songs. the best part is it’s official, and bbc is doing it intentionally, we’re not just coming up with all of it haha. 

haseul is currently on hiatus because of some mental health issues, but were wishing her the best so she can get well soon! 

loona tv has 600+ episodes, which seems daunting until you find out that almost every episode is about a minute long. they also have a show called loona the tam, and vlogs that the members themselves edit called loona logs. that’s a great way to get to know them. 

i hope this is helpful!! let me know if you want to know more about anything, i ult them so i know quite a bit :))"

8424,2020-10-07 02:44:15,j6ipn0,Jeffree Star is a horrendous human being.
8425,2020-10-07 02:25:55,j6ipn0,Who is Jeffrey ?
8426,2020-10-07 03:34:11,j6ipn0,"Honestly, I get what everyone in the comments is saying but Bekah still could’ve handled it better. She could’ve made a story saying *why* you shouldn’t purchase from Jeffree instead of just telling people not to come for her. 

And I get it, I really do. I still use Jeffree products I have but I haven’t bought anything from his brand in over 2 years. I don’t waste the makeup I have but I also don’t promote him or talk about his makeup quality because he doesn’t deserve it. I also will never purchase from him ever again. 

The difference between us and Bekah is that Bekah is an influencer. Her followers look to her for advice, recommendations, etc. Especially with the platform she’s built, I would’ve expected she would make a statement about why Jeffree shouldn’t receive support. 

Comments are pretty divisive on this thread but that’s just how I see it"
8427,2020-10-07 07:44:14,j6ipn0,"The thing about this is that Bekah would be the FIRST person to call someone else out for using products made by a known racist/ homophobe/ abuser so it’s just further hypocritical behaviour from her. 

From a cynical perspective I fully think she posted this on purpose to get people talking as evidenced by the ‘dont come for me’ story posted directly after. She relies on being the ‘outspoken controversial one’ in BN as her brand, she knew exactly what she was doing with this."
8428,2020-10-07 02:24:44,j6ipn0,My hate for Jeffrey Star knows no limits
8429,2020-10-07 03:00:18,j6ipn0,Is there a Reddit thread someone can point me to with a deep dive on Jeffree Star - never got into this community but want to know everything. I just know he sucks
8430,2020-10-07 02:28:51,j6ipn0,"He is so vile and disgusting and has been a known racist, misogynist, and worse for over a decade. I always side eye anyone who would associate or use his products, or support him at all financially."
8431,2020-10-07 03:35:59,j6ipn0,Hes been awful for over a freaking decade...
8432,2020-10-07 03:10:15,j6ipn0,"Okay so I'm not passing judgment either way, because I am under-informed here, but I did happen to see one of Bekah's stories where Ruth was playing with this same compact (might have been this same day) and Bekah wrote something like don't at me this is 10 (?) years old and empty. So again, I don't know about this, so not saying that makes it okay, but it looks like it may be an old compact Ruth plays with that Bekah picked up to shoot some ""candids."" AGAIN, (reiterating because I've had too many internet fights today), I do not know more about this so I'm not saying it is cool."
8433,2020-10-07 03:37:37,j6ipn0,"Ah yes, because bekah who openly makes 10k+ a month, couldn’t afford a new makeup mirror instead of one by a notorious racist and abuser."
8434,2020-10-07 04:28:56,j6ipn0,"Ahhh, thank you for confirming that my unfollowing her after the RBG stuff was, indeed, the correct decision."
8435,2020-10-07 05:26:44,j6ipn0,"I don't follow make up world, but when it comes to Star, all I've heard for years seems to be that he sucks. How is he still a thing? His make up is that good!?"
8436,2020-10-07 02:25:21,j6ipn0,She literally posted a few stories after that the compact was old and empty and that she bought it years ago. She was just using it as a mirror. Probably didn’t think twice about it. I have at least 3 old compacts that are empty and still use for mirrors.
8437,2020-10-07 06:07:31,j6ipn0,"People think we are being too harsh on Bekah but she knows her platform is huge and that posting a picture using JS mirror, is asking for backlash. Why should we defend or feel bad for calling out influencers who make millions for supporting horrible people."
8438,2020-10-07 03:23:33,j6ipn0,"This feels a little over the top. Can we really go hard on Bekah for using an old empty Jeffrey Star compact as a mirror in a picture while we spend our free time discussing and supporting a show arguably just as racist and sexist as Jeffrey star himself??

Editing to add: the more i think about this the more ridiculous it seems. We are all on here talking about a show that is literally created by a man who very violently assaulted his pregnant wife kind of recently. He gets more money the more we watch the show. That didn’t stop us from watching the show but we are mad at Bekah for using an old empty compact? Like at what point do we stop holding people to higher standards that we would ever hold ourselves?"
8439,2020-10-07 04:11:09,j6ipn0,Using anything in your stories as an influencer is promoting. Her content is staged and reviewed.

8441,2020-10-07 04:35:48,j6ipn0,"I think she knew exactly what she was doing. I swear this song and dance with her is so irritating.  She does something she knows will have people critize her then she whines when they do. Said it once, saying it now... I can't stand her."
8442,2020-10-07 02:25:01,j6ipn0,I wouldn’t call this “promoting”
8443,2020-10-07 02:24:28,j6ipn0,She’s not promoting Jeffree Star. You conveniently didn’t include the following story. This sub is ridiculous.
8444,2020-10-07 03:22:34,j6ipn0,Will never be a fan of JS or Bekah and that’s a hill I’ll die on
8445,2020-10-07 02:27:20,j6ipn0,all she had to do was blur out the brand name or put a sticker on top. buuuuut no. Bekah seems to get off on negative feedback lol her following stories show she knows she's gonna get pushback
8446,2020-10-07 02:27:02,j6ipn0,"you guys, let her live. 

like seriously - you all hold people actually in your life this accountable?"
8447,2020-10-07 02:57:31,j6ipn0,I didn’t think this was the biggest deal in the world. She did say in her stories it’s old and showed there was no makeup in it- seemed like she was just using old stuff with her daughter to pose for pictures.
8448,2020-10-07 02:33:23,j6ipn0,"You should have added her follow up story though , she wasn’t promoting him"
8449,2020-10-07 03:27:46,j6ipn0,"I knew the second I opened this story she was going to get heat for it but honestly guys let’s not start a Bekah pile on

Bekah’s whole brand is “reuse don’t throw out,” yes blurring the logo would have been a good preventative step but it’s okay to continue using an old compact as a mirror it doesn’t make her a terrible person"
8450,2020-10-07 02:35:55,j6ipn0,Did you watch her following stories? Post it all if you’re gonna call her out
8451,2020-10-07 05:28:47,j6ipn0,I am girly and love makeup but don’t watch YT. I had no idea it was bad to use his products... eek
8452,2020-10-07 02:54:41,j6ipn0,she’s really not promoting him. seems like it’s just random candids her friend took of her.
8453,2020-10-07 02:21:36,j6ipn0,"For someone so actively discussing racial issues and calling out racism, you would think she’d think twice before posting something like this.

Edit: she later says it’s an empty pan and she just uses it for the mirror. But you know, maybe you should just buy a new mirror or avoid publicly sharing images of it to your million followers?"
8454,2020-10-07 02:36:59,j6ipn0,"This is ridiculous. She posted a story immediately after this saying it was an empty pan that she uses as a mirror. You all should be ashamed of yourselves. If you don’t like Bekah, just stop following her."
8455,2020-10-07 03:22:54,j6ipn0,"Anddd I'm semi-caught up. I don't know how this person literally did not exist in my world, if not through pop culture at least because of his horrific behavior. And damn, he is not great!!!!! Definitely think the better move for Bekah would have been to just black it out.   
Now, I don't mean to undo what I just said or be an apologist here, because I agree, just crop it out, you're an influencer and it's offensive. But there is part of me that gets frustrated that because Bekah brings her politics to the table, she catches so much heat. Meanwhile there are known trump voters who make money in BN and have tons of supporters, but because they hide their politics (to increase their marketability, aka make money), they coast. And I also feel like there are people on this sub and elsewhere who feel challenged by Bekah's views and then jump on these threads/insta comments etc. to capitalize on any mistake she makes, not because they're actually progressive, but because they're excited to be able to shit on Bekah.  
REPEATING: I agree she should have removed it, never posted, or when called out changed it at least etc. I do think she can be stubborn around her blind spots. But I also think it's a shame that people who put their views out there get slammed while closet racists skate by. And I dislike knowing there are non-progressives out there using this as a reason to pile on Bekah."
8456,2020-10-07 05:56:57,j6ipn0,"I'm getting so sick of the Bekah pile ons, she donates tons of money, speaks out about causes and politics, apologizes when wrong. But no, lets freak out because she's using a 10 year old mirror."
8457,2020-10-07 04:42:25,j6ipn0,The great thing about Bekah is if you let her know *in a constructive way* she’ll actually address the issue head-on and likely not use his products again.
8458,2020-10-07 04:23:27,j6ipn0,Post the rest of the stories too...
8459,2020-10-07 02:27:45,j6ipn0,Bekah is so annoying smh
8460,2020-10-07 02:57:15,j6ipn0,Oh no.
8461,2020-10-07 02:50:14,j6ipn0,Oh come on don’t hold her accountable for her actions
8462,2020-10-07 02:55:25,j6ipn0,I'm excited to hear her bitch about this on her podcast or whatever instead of taking responsibility for her actions
8463,2020-10-07 02:27:10,j6ipn0,You’re better off not knowing
8464,2020-10-07 03:53:19,j6ipn0,It's also not like her only choice was to throw it out and buy something else or promote a racist rapist with zero context on her ig to thousands of people. A ton of beauty gurus either use their JSC stuff off camera and give dupes or alter the packaging so it's not recognizable... she's clearly aware of JSC's problems and literally could googled options about how to address it as an influencer because it's such a common issue
8465,2020-10-07 03:21:20,j6ipn0,Watch D’Angelo Wallace’s video on him located [here](https://youtu.be/IdGWdWE7-k8). It’s 46 minutes but catches you up on almost everything minus the newest scandal posted below.
8466,2020-10-07 03:01:30,j6ipn0,"oh man. r/beautyguruchatter might have some good threads on him

edit: #1 looks promising haha"
8467,2020-10-07 03:18:47,j6ipn0,"Look up the channel Tea Spill on YouTube, he has so many jeffreestar videos. Eat your heart out"
8468,2020-10-07 04:15:02,j6ipn0,https://www.insider.com/jeffree-star-sexual-assault-allegations-violence-accused-predator-myspace-payments-2020-9
8469,2020-10-07 02:41:26,j6ipn0,And it’s just been found out he is a sexual assaulter and paid hush money.
8470,2020-10-07 04:26:01,j6ipn0,"This is off topic but I actually think she makes more than that, or at least used to. When she posted her 10% a month to charity initiative I believe the math on her screenshot worked out to being $50k in one month 

I’m always amazing at the money you can make influencing!"
8471,2020-10-07 03:42:42,j6ipn0,She is also very open about not wanting to buy new stuff in favor of using what she already has. The mirror works perfectly fine and the money has already been spent. I think the best option would be for her to blur out the logo so she’s not promoting the brand.
8472,2020-10-07 04:36:43,j6ipn0,What happened that made you unfollow ?! What did she say!!
8473,2020-10-07 06:10:24,j6ipn0,Honestly his skin frosts were amazing! I absolutely loved Peach Goddess (the one Bekah is using) obviously I don’t have them anymore though
8474,2020-10-07 06:17:47,j6ipn0,"And what about influencers showing they use Amazon prime? Shop at Wal-Mart? Wear clothes from Target? All of these companies have done horrific things to humanity from sweat shops, to starvation wages, to wiping out local businesses, where are all those callouts?"
8475,2020-10-07 04:15:14,j6ipn0,"I really like your edited comment, it’s true! The Bachelor is also a product created by shitty people and yet I still consume it and recommend it to others as good entertainment. What does that say about me?"
8476,2020-10-07 03:33:24,j6ipn0,"I 100% agree this is over the top and also think it’s a bit iffy to have a moderator be pinning personal call out posts like this? 

(Yes Jeffery Starr is terrible but i think it’s clear she was not promoting him)"
8477,2020-10-07 03:38:36,j6ipn0,Are you familiar with Jeffree beyond the most recent scandals? He's absolutely vile
8478,2020-10-07 04:56:46,j6ipn0,"I agree, I watched her stories and didn't even notice the brand on the compact. I was confused when she posted the story explaining herself because it hadn't even registered for me. She was just sharing some nice pictures of her family. She was not ""promoting a product"". Everyone here is acting like she made some calculated move when I really just think it was an oversight on her part. 
For the record, I'm not a Bekah stan and she usually kinda annoys me. I've also never supported j star and would never buy one of his products."
8479,2020-10-07 10:33:49,j6ipn0,You make a good point. There’s a strong argument that supporting this show is problematic itself
8480,2020-10-07 03:24:36,j6ipn0,"Just as racist and sexist as jeffree star? I get what you are saying, but I disagree."
8481,2020-10-07 03:34:10,j6ipn0,THANK YOU. add up all the time you spend harassing people for tiny things on the internet every week and then devote that to like attending your city council meeting or joining an ICE watch or something damn
8482,2020-10-07 03:38:38,j6ipn0,"If u make ur career being an influencer, you are going to be judged for the products you choose to show on your job.

This is the same woman who learned what empathy is like 2 weeks ago."
8483,2020-10-07 12:30:28,j6ipn0,But isn’t Jeffrey Star... racist? I think that’s why it’s surprising and disappointing to see someone like bekah (who is vocally anti-racists) support him (both with her money and now indirectly through her platform)
8484,2020-10-07 05:07:18,j6ipn0,"Yes! It happens over and over again. The same pattern. A couple weeks from now, it'll be something new."
8485,2020-10-07 02:30:49,j6ipn0,"That’s how this sub is, they give half the story"
8486,2020-10-07 02:26:30,j6ipn0,posting a photo of herself using the product = promotion. same as when vf's WLM modeling was exposed.
8487,2020-10-07 02:25:08,j6ipn0,would you like to include it for us then
8488,2020-10-07 02:25:16,j6ipn0,I mean.... using a product as an influencer is promotion. Whether intentional or not 🤷‍♀️. She took the time to be professionally photographed with the product and shared them the same way she would a paid ad.
8489,2020-10-07 05:52:29,j6ipn0,Seriously 🤣 such a joke
8490,2020-10-07 02:38:39,j6ipn0,"Its seriously so transparent she did this to spark some outrage and get engagement, post stories of DMs she is getting about it and her setting the record straight."
8491,2020-10-07 02:33:39,j6ipn0,Do I call out my friends and family for supporting known racists? Yeah I do!
8492,2020-10-07 02:34:28,j6ipn0,Lol no one I know uses Jeffree Star makeup bc he’s a piece of shit.
8493,2020-10-07 02:42:13,j6ipn0,He is a sexual assaulter.
8494,2020-10-07 02:36:36,j6ipn0,"yeah, I do. and I'm sure others do as well? what's wrong with holding people accountable for promoting shitty people's products?"
8495,2020-10-07 02:46:39,j6ipn0,[deleted]
8496,2020-10-07 03:15:24,j6ipn0,no they don't lmao
8497,2020-10-07 03:57:48,j6ipn0,"we are all on a sub dedicated to a show whose creator and top exec recently assaulted his pregnant wife, and also who once fought and won a lawsuit saying that they did not need to include diversity on their show, so I’m not sure how anyone on this page is any better than some girl using an old compact as a mirror"
8498,2020-10-07 03:56:33,j6ipn0,Yes I’m shocked do you NOT hold the people in your life accountable ??? Couldn’t be me n my friends lmao
8499,2020-10-07 02:28:32,j6ipn0,This.
8500,2020-10-07 03:01:19,j6ipn0,Yeah I mean so many people in BN do worse and get a pass. This sub is really hard on Bekah
8501,2020-10-07 02:35:31,j6ipn0,"posting a photo with a product is promotion. her follow up story is just ""it's old, don't come for me"". put a sticker over the logo, sharpie it out, literally anything that isn't posting a photo of the brand front and center."
8502,2020-10-07 03:36:24,j6ipn0,"It's not about using it, it's about *advertising* it. Especially considering he's in another scandal right now and is accused of literally drugging and raping minors."
8503,2020-10-07 03:31:59,j6ipn0,"all she has to do was put a sticker on the logo. she knew she'd get pushback, it's part of her whole weird schtick. do or say something inflammatory, get feedback, react poorly to feedback. wash rinse repeat"
8504,2020-10-07 03:38:38,j6ipn0,"I would rather her replace a makeup mirror and spend 20 bucks then promote a racist abuser on her story, but that’s just me"
8505,2020-10-07 12:33:35,j6ipn0,As a heads up- most of the YouTube makeup community is extremely toxic and problematic
8506,2020-10-07 03:01:58,j6ipn0,that she chose to post. no one forced her to post these
8507,2020-10-07 03:50:09,j6ipn0,I think this is a good post and generating a lot of good discussion but I do want to say seeing your opinion pinned at the top as a moderator post did throw me a bit. I think this sort of personal call out should maybe be categorized as a normal user post in the future and not pinned like this
8508,2020-10-07 03:53:28,j6ipn0,Why is this a pinned mod comment?
8509,2020-10-07 02:37:28,j6ipn0,"or just put a sticker, physically or on instagram, over the logo. or just, like you said...not share the photo. bing bang boom drama avoided."
8510,2020-10-07 02:25:12,j6ipn0,"She did say later in her stories that it’s an old empty compact she has just kept over the years. So it sounds like she doesn’t support him anymore. But yeah, she probably should have just blurred it or put an emoji over it. Thank god she doesn’t actively support him though, that would be so gross."
8511,2020-10-07 02:48:05,j6ipn0,Why couldn’t she just.... blur it out? This is NOT the time to promote voldemort 🙄
8512,2020-10-07 03:15:36,j6ipn0,"It reminds me of Claudia Oshry having a jacket in her closet with the confederate flag on it, but it was something made by Kanye and gifted to her that she supposedly never wore. It’s still something problematic you choose to keep and have on display... worthy of at LEAST a side eye."
8513,2020-10-07 03:28:38,j6ipn0,She didn’t even condemn Jeffree. She just said it’s empty and “don’t come for me”. It would’ve been better if she explained *why* it’s not okay to purchase from Jeffree
8514,2020-10-07 02:39:30,j6ipn0,ashamed of ourselves for calling out a rich influencer promoting a racist? pls explain
8515,2020-10-07 02:41:38,j6ipn0,I like bekah a lot. I just don’t see why she could have just not shared this picture.
8516,2020-10-07 07:04:44,j6ipn0,Just because she does admirable things doesn’t mean she’s immune to being called out. I think it’s fair to be critical !
8517,2020-10-07 04:44:06,j6ipn0,"she *knows* about J*. the next story or two is her saying ""it's old, I know how it looks don't come for me"""
8518,2020-10-07 07:51:01,j6ipn0,Ummm can you give an example of this? Because when she was called out over the inappropriate comments she made about the death of RBG she shifted accountability to her parents and then inexplicably doubled down on ‘well actually she wasn’t that great’
8519,2020-10-07 02:58:16,j6ipn0,Ok I’ll take your word for it lol!

8521,2020-10-07 03:50:07,j6ipn0,Tons of people alter their JSC products or make a point of not showing this on camera. Half an hour and some paint and this would've been fine and honestly probably cooler looking.
8522,2020-10-07 03:46:44,j6ipn0,"Well yeah, I mean so many people argue on this subreddit that being an influencer is a “job” and I agree it is. It’s different, it’s wild, but it’s a job that earns money if you handle it right. Bekahs job as an influencer is to influence. And many of her followers probably have the same views as her. If most of her followers have those views, I don’t know why bekah thought it would be a good idea to show herself with a jeffree star mirror, who is very much opposite of what bekah values. It seems cheap to me, like when she posted an amy Schumer ad and then said she “didn’t do enough research” but then also kept the ad up. I think bekah is smart, and knows what she’s doing and what she can get away with. She should have blurred this out. That’s my two cents"
8523,2020-10-07 04:39:35,j6ipn0,"She said on her podcast that she and her sister were making fun of people who were crying that RBG died, and then later on her Insta did some research and said she hadn’t actually known who RBG was before

It was all in bad taste, even if you don’t know who someone is it’s not cool to make fun of other people grieving"
8524,2020-10-07 04:41:07,j6ipn0,[this](https://www.reddit.com/r/thebachelor/comments/ixt95y/confused_about_bekahs_response_to_rbgs_passing_i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) will fill you in
8525,2020-10-07 04:45:49,j6ipn0,"She made fun of people crying over Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death on her podcast, then went onto her IG stories talking about how she didn't know the extent of RBG's work, which just seems...weird for someone who makes herself out to be so woke.

It wasn't only that, specifically, but I started to realize she's just bad at taking criticism, in general and that situation highlighted it. I also really disliked how she posted her ads but she recently changed to be more transparent, so I can appreciate that."
8526,2020-10-07 06:56:07,j6ipn0,There was literally a callout today of Amanda Stanton shilling the Amazon Prime day....
8527,2020-10-07 03:44:40,j6ipn0,"The pinned comment is really strange to me. It’s a valid POV, but not sure why that needed to be an official comment."
8528,2020-10-07 03:32:45,j6ipn0,"That’s fair, he is certainly more blatant about it. The bachelor is savvy enough to constantly adjust their racism and sexism to be just below the threshold of getting canceled for the times."
8529,2020-10-07 09:11:17,j6ipn0,No this sub cares abt every little detail on a pic and psychoanalyzes it. People don’t have time for this shit they are just clicking thru IG stories.
8530,2020-10-07 12:59:56,j6ipn0,How is she supporting him when she just posted a candid of herself and literally said she doesn’t support him? She is not convincing anyone to buy this product. No one is looking at this picture and saying “oh let me go get some Jeffrey Star makeup.” Only this sub are offended and even have time for this
8531,2020-10-07 05:52:11,j6ipn0,This is not even professionally photographed haha
8532,2020-10-07 09:55:24,j6ipn0,"\>using a product as an influencer is promotion.   


I'm shocked by how many posters don't understand this."
8533,2020-10-07 02:40:53,j6ipn0,Bekah's whole weird cycle of posting something stupid to spark outrage and engagement is so tired. like girl please take a nap
8534,2020-10-07 03:59:11,j6ipn0,Honestly the glaring lack of progressivism in this sub recently has made me so sad. It used to feel so different here a few yrs ago
8535,2020-10-07 03:35:57,j6ipn0,"Yeah it was easily avoided but I don’t think all the people calling her racist are totally fair here. Attention seeking, sure"
8536,2020-10-07 04:31:13,j6ipn0,"thank you! also....Jeffree was awful years ago lmao. Whenever she bought it, he was problematic. And she still chose to post a picture using his products front and center."
8537,2020-10-07 03:41:47,j6ipn0,"I agree that he’s terrible and that this was easily avoided but generally I don’t think we should trash people for using up or reusing stuff they already own. Like he already got her money so why does this need to end up in a landfill you know?

That being said I personally would have probably put a sticker on it or something if I was going to use it everyday"
8538,2020-10-07 14:34:35,j6ipn0,"Oh... well my thing is if they are problematic why does Sephora and them still sell their products? Bc consumers like me will purchase, use, use sometimes in public, and I’m not sure people should be shamed for that if they have no idea who these people are"
8539,2020-10-07 03:44:00,j6ipn0,and she’s probably more focused on the fact that it was a cute picture of her and her daughter than what the name on her old compact is? come on.
8540,2020-10-07 07:02:58,j6ipn0,agreed-this feels like a misuse of power
8541,2020-10-07 10:42:16,j6ipn0,"yeah these pinned comments always seem like the ""end all be all"" so for it to be an opinion is a bit odd"
8542,2020-10-07 02:30:53,j6ipn0,Yeah it would have been really easy to just not share that image.
8543,2020-10-07 02:55:27,j6ipn0,"Sure, I’ll explain. There’s a difference between promoting a product, and having a product showing in a photo and then clarifying that the product is old and empty. If someone chooses to buy J* (who, yes, I’m very much aware is a terrible person) it’s not going to be based on this photo being posted. Pretending that this photo is a promotion of J* is just that, pretending."

8546,2020-10-07 05:34:59,j6ipn0,At least I was right about her addressing the issue head on 🤷🏽‍♀️
8547,2020-10-07 03:57:53,j6ipn0,Not the point of your post (which I agree with) but maybe you can explain why posting an Amy Schumer ad was problematic? I feel like I’m missing something and googling her brings up all sorts of irrelevant results. TIA!
8548,2020-10-07 06:22:41,j6ipn0,This still blows my mind. We gave her so much credit for naming her daughter after RBG...
8549,2020-10-07 13:08:15,j6ipn0,"That’s actually how influencing works. You post pictures of yourself using someone’s products. Other people want to look like you- so they buy that product. It seems stupid, but that’s it. Her posting a picture using JS is supporting him. The fact that her money went to his product, is supporting him."
8550,2020-10-07 09:49:11,j6ipn0,I have no idea how she has time for that rubbish while raising two small children.

8552,2020-10-07 05:32:18,j6ipn0,"I'm trying to go zero waste so I agree, but as folks have mentioned--she could have easily just popped an emoji over it or blurred it."
8553,2020-10-07 14:55:35,j6ipn0,They prove themselves over and over again to be absolute trash... but sadly it’s all about the money. And bad press is still press
8554,2020-10-07 03:54:55,j6ipn0,"a couple stories later she literally says ""it's old don't come for me"". she knew how it would come off to people 🤷🏼‍♀️"
8555,2020-10-07 04:08:16,j6ipn0,Exactly!! Why even keep that trash? Throw it away and use a different compact mirror!
8556,2020-10-07 02:58:34,j6ipn0,"
Even just having your face with something so horribly offensive is an issue. It doesn't matter if a rich influencer with 600,000 followers means to promote something, and Bekah isnt dumb. she knows putting a product in her photo that *she chose* to post and *knew she'd get pushback for* is a stupid move.

for example, VF didn't ever (to my knowledge) actively promote her modeling the White Lives Matter merch, but her association with the brand was enough ""promotion"" to get her in trouble."
8557,2020-10-07 02:54:29,j6ipn0,ILY ❤️
8558,2020-10-07 08:32:41,j6ipn0,"That was a giant assumption people made lol. IIRC, Ruth was a family name."
8559,2020-10-07 04:19:37,j6ipn0,"I think calling this promoting the makeup is a bit of a stretch though, like this is a candid her friend took on a disposable camera that she thought was cute. If it was an actual posed shoot or dedicated post then, yes, I agree it would be problematic af"
8560,2020-10-07 08:43:07,j6ipn0,"I mean. Are all fans of the Washington Football Team (pre name change) racist? If a contestant posted a picture of them eating Papa John’s pizza, would you call them racist? Are Hannah B and Kaitlyn homophobic because they eat Chik-Fil-A? Heck, is everyone who watches and promotes the Bachelor misogynistic? 

I understand people’s concerns and think Bekah was being tone-deaf and frankly ignorant by posting it. The post itself is problematic. But I think calling her *racist* for posting a picture with a decade-old empty makeup compact is a bit of a reach."
8561,2020-10-07 04:04:44,j6ipn0,"again- her friend took a candid shot of her, she happened to be holding an old makeup case of someone who she clearly doesn’t support anymore. this seems like a crazy small thing to try to turn into a big deal."
8562,2020-10-07 03:07:28,j6ipn0,Not really seeing the correlation between VF and Bekah other than they’re both people that this sub loves to pile on 🤷‍♀️
8563,2020-10-07 04:43:04,j6ipn0,"normally yes. but she has almost 700,000 followers. Bekah isnt stupid. she knows how social media works. she chose to post this ""candid"", chose not to blur out or sticker over the brand. she knew what she was doing 🤷🏼‍♀️"
8564,2020-10-07 04:32:53,j6ipn0,"she has almost 700K followers on IG. anything and everything she posts is promotion (plus, this wasn't a product off to the side, Jeffree's ENTIRE LOGO is front and center in the pic)"
8565,2020-10-07 08:43:19,j6ipn0,"It looks as though you may have spelled ""Chick-fil-A"" incorrectly. No worries, it happens to the best of us!"
8566,2020-10-07 03:11:33,j6ipn0,promoting racists is their correlation lol. VF has been wrongly shit on by this sub for lots of things but modeling for a White Lives Matter line is not one of those things
8567,2020-10-07 03:21:14,j6ipn0,Lol ok 👍
8568,2020-10-07 03:45:00,j6ipn0,huh? people talked at length about the white lives matter thing. pretty sure that this sub is how I even found out about it.
8569,2020-10-07 04:00:05,j6ipn0,That commentor is saying that discussion about VF and WLM was warranted and not wrongly trashing her.

8579,2020-10-04 00:41:48,j4piw4,"It's a bit hard to give tips without knowing what it is you struggle with, so do feel free to respond with any additional information you may have about what is difficult. Meanwhile, here are the eyeshadow tips I can think of just off the top of my head (many of which are applicable to other things too but I'm focusing on eyeshadow because you mentioned that:  


1. Get different brushes for different purposes. I'll boldly assume based on the fake Jeffree Star palettes that you don't want to spend a lot of money on makeup, so maybe start off getting a pack of cheap brushes from Amazon or something. As long as you've got several different types. A fluffy one for blending, a dense one for packing on shadow, a small one for details, etc. I'd say you probably want at least like 5 different ones? I use way more than that in my routine but it's a good start. You'll really struggle to get good color payoff if you're trying to pack on color with a fluffy blending brush, for instance. So get some tools for different things.
2. Build up slowly. It's way easier to add more than to take away, and it's very difficult to blend harsh lines. Gradually building up the color and blending as you go along really helps to make it look better.
3. If you don't already, definitely get a good eyeshadow primer! I personally use the Smashbox 24h one (small silver tube) but it's kinda expensive so idk if you'd want to splurge on that, but it truly is amazing and a massive investment. If you want something cheaper, try to consider what your issue is. Do your eyelids get oily? Then see if you can find a mattifying primer. Do you have dry skin or trouble getting pigment payoff? Try a more tacky primer. Sadly this might take some experimentation as not all primers are created equal and it also depends on your skin type, so definitely do research before buying anything. For me personally primer is the makeup product I splurge the most on because it makes everything else work better - I would much rather have my amazing primer with crappy cheap eyeshadows than the other way around!
4. Really study your eye shape to figure out what works for you. Completely copying online tutorials most likely won't look great because you probably don't have the same face as that person. Learn to work with what YOU have and make it look good! This takes time and practice but it's definitely worth it.
5. While still learning, remember that soft smokey looks are easier to ""get away"" with. Fine details and things that need to be crisp and perfect are hard, so stick with beginner level soft blends until you've increased your skill. Almost anyone can do a pretty decent smokey eye without too much practice, but intricate eyeliner designs and cut creases and such are much harder and way more obvious when you mess up.

Let me know if you have any more specific issues you need help with! These are just the general tips I could think of right now."
8580,2020-10-04 10:21:12,j4piw4,One thing I like to do is BLEND THAT BITCH(eyeshadow/eyeliner) create a nice gradient(always good to start with light color and then add the darker one.)
8581,2020-10-04 01:08:06,j4piw4,"thank you so much! you've been very helpful!
 and as for specifics, i honestly cant give any. all i know is that everything i do looks bad. primer might be a good idea tho since i dont actually use it! i didnt realise it was so important. 
another thing i struggle with a lot tho is eyebrows, like ive never really done anything too them even though i should. i dont really have eyebrows that show at all, and people make it sound and look so easy to fill them in a little but whenever i do it it looks like someone drew them on with a crayon T-T   
i'm 100% going to buy some more brushes and some primer tho, hopefully it helps"
8582,2020-10-04 01:17:53,j4piw4,"Eyebrows are an interesting one and there are lots of factors. First of all, do you want to stick with your natural shape or modify it? Sticking with your natural shape is probably easier since it gives you a guideline for where to go, but modifying gives more creative freedom and you have the opportunity to make the shape more flattering. I personally don't have any eyebrows at all and just draw them on because my natural eyebrows are terrible and too far down (so I had hardly any room for eyeshadow with my natural brows), however the downside was that I had pretty ugly fake eyebrows for a while, haha. Even if you do want to modify the shape it might be a good idea to start off by just learning to fill in your natural ones to get a feel for how it works.  


Secondly, do you want them to look natural or not? Since you're saying ""it looks like someone drew them on with a crayon"" I'll guess you are currently making them look too unnatural for your liking and you'd want to make them more natural looking? One tip for that is to use a powder product rather than a pencil since it gives a softer result, and it's also easier to fix if you make a mistake. Maybe find a brow product (it can also be an eyeshadow in the correct color, doesn't need to be marketed as a brow product) and use a relatively ""sharp"" small angled brush to apply it. This fills the brows in pretty naturally without making them look drawn on. I also urge you to pay extra attention to making the outer ends pointy, because I find that a lot of newbies make the outer tail ends of their brows quite blunt which also makes them look more drawn on.  


Anything else you'd like to know about brows, or other makeup areas?"
8583,2020-10-04 01:37:37,j4piw4,"just one more question actually!  when it comes to eyebrows, how important are they generally to the whole eye makeup look? like, i'd love to go for the all out goth look of having them drawn on in black, but it just feels too much for me to pull off doing considering i currently cant even fill them in without it looking bad. but i also get the feeling that doing anything drastic when it comes to the eyes kind of needs the eyebrows done all out to not look stupid. like is there any looks with eyeshadow that would just look silly with brows only filled in in a more natural way?  

thank you so much for your helpful advice dsfgfggns;ng T-T"
8584,2020-10-04 01:52:53,j4piw4,"I think it's probably preferable to do SOMETHING with the eyebrows and not leave them completely ""blank"" or else the whole makeup can look sort of... unfinished? The way you do them isn't super important though. As for making your eyebrows black, I think that's only advisable if you have black hair (or possibly a dark unnatural color). Otherwise it's better to match your eyebrows to your hair color, or only slightly darker. Like, if you have medium brown hair and black eyebrows, that's gonna look weird no matter how flawlessly you've done your eyebrows, because it just doesn't match. You can totally do pretty natural brows and make it look good though! It's enough to fill in your brows just enough to neaten up the edges a bit and fill in any gaps. See for instance this makeup video, she's got very natural brows: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCCaYeJH0vc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCCaYeJH0vc)  


As for what looks go with what eyebrows, I think overall a more smokey eyeshadow look works best with natural brows. If you make a more fierce ""sharp"" look with many clean lines it might need ""sharp"" brows to go with it, but a grungy smokey eyeshadow look works perfectly well with more natural brows!"

8701,2020-11-09 03:38:21,jqlytn,"I'm dead at your boyfriend 😂 Whenever my boyfriend would see me watching Jeffree videos he'd say, ""Ah, the skeleton makeup man"" and then walk away. He's not totally wrong. 

&#x200B;

Also Jeffree presents very feminine and a lot of straight men (including his ex Nate) find him attractive."
8702,2020-11-08 23:41:42,jqlytn,"Aww, he seems like a confused sweetheart! I hope I can help: yep, live beastie,( think an alligator, but can’t visually tell a difference) -he did make the makeup he bought you- a mini orgy I would say 6 people? Maybe 8? -Natural.. no idea, it’s always blonde under the wigs. I’ve only ever seen him in ‘real’ blonde! -It is called a palette-They are cool!-nope, he’s a very pretty Alien, and on most shoots, he’s radiantly beautiful- Why you were awake? No idea! Munchies?  I hope he got some much needed snores over you laughing😄😄"
8703,2020-11-09 12:42:02,jqlytn,I thought alligators were the more vicious ones.  Or at least foreigners are surprised at the people always missing in the everglades.  Mini orgies are where no one is taller than 6'.

ummm so i dont know how to put this... lol.... <3"
8705,2020-11-09 06:55:39,jqlytn,I found the release video absolutely rushed and kind of embarrassing. I think his products have become bad quality and are overpriced. Sorry Jeffree.
8706,2020-11-14 10:29:49,jqlytn,I think that's awesome that he showed genuine interest in something you like. You two sound like you have an adorable dynamic. Dated a guy awhole back that would get angry when I watched Jeffree and just made comments about how annoying he sounded/looked. Pretty sure that was a sign that he wasn't the one so I think your opposite experience says a lot about your man!

8709,2020-11-09 06:13:38,jqlytn,"Yeah I’m gonna get downvoted for this and so be it but this video was really bad. I have no idea why it was so clearly and obviously rushed like they even held off putting it up by a whole day and it’s actually making me really not want to buy anything if this is how bad the reveal for the products is. No live swatches AGAIN, so far away it felt like he was on QVC and like he was actually selling me something when your biggest thing as an influencer and brand owner is to not give someone that feeling, you should be selling to me like you’re my friend and his reveals have slowly been getting away from that this year but this was easily the most egregios one. Also, he didn’t seem to know what several product names were and had to obviously look at a piece of paper?? He tried to talk about how easy the palette was to open and then had trouble opening it? The sound of quality of the whole video was like his outfit was on the mic the whole time. I’m gonna say it too, as a mua that eyeliner formula looks legit awful from those picture swatches and I can’t get over it (if someone reading this gets it please @ me and lmk how it is though bc I’d love to be wrong, the shades he made are v lovely and I can’t wait to see what other colors he does but I still remember how “creamy” the first round of lip liners were and they were actually terrible and had to be reformulated). I’m kind of disappointed bc green is one of my favorite colors especially in makeup and I’ve been so hyped for this since he trademarked it. P much the only thing I’m happy w is the palette, the extreme frosts and the glosses and I’ll probably grab the travel bag and green backpack and lip balm but everything else was very underwhelming for me and I don’t think it’ll be an at launch purchase for me of any of these things ://"
8710,2020-11-09 09:38:22,jqlytn,I feel like his natural color is like a medium brown color from what I’ve seen in different videos....but who knows....maybe pink IS his natural color 🤣
8711,2020-11-09 12:43:02,jqlytn,Side note I wondered if the croc was Jim Nesche's Bubba.  He's a very calm reptile.
8712,2020-11-09 00:08:16,jqlytn,"Or maybe he's a hollywood alligator and being so well-fed he becomes docile while he's digesting, and the big collar was just soft fluffy material covering his real , comfortable, secure collar for the glam."
8713,2020-11-09 11:33:11,jqlytn,I definitely have to agree with you about the video. He addressed on his Snapchat that a lot of people were unhappy with the new filming set and I noticed the audio quality was off as well. He said YouTube has taken down the video for “nudity” so he is going to refilm a new video and do swatches this time
8714,2020-11-09 12:31:26,jqlytn,"QVC! That’s what it reminds me of! I made a comment last week about how much I hate the new collection reveals, but I couldn’t put my finger on what it reminded me of. The new reveal videos are so dramatic and don’t show the products very well.

And that trunk lock looks like and absolute nightmare."

8729,2020-11-08 17:03:18,jqf1gm,"the thing is though he does not educate or improve himself. he puts out an apology saying he will become a better person but then he goes and does the same stuff again, there is no improvement whatsoever."
8730,2020-11-08 17:03:24,jqf1gm,"If all his toxicity and fuck ups were in the past, maybe there could be redemption. I'm a big fan of people learning and growing. But he keeps pulling the same shit, acting like the victim while trying to blackmail people. He's just fully not a good person. He keeps showing the same colors and it's time to move on. As a consumer, we hold the power in spending money on things that are worthwhile. He doesn't separate himself from his brand, so to me, buying it feels like I'm condoning bad behavior and questionable morals. It's not for me. If he can't improve himself, I can't support him."
8731,2020-11-08 17:15:43,jqf1gm,">that they choose to educate and improve themselves 

That’s the issue; he hasn’t. I’m not a fan of the form of cancel culture that involves digging up old tweets and the like because I believe people can grow and change and we were operating under different standards of acceptability a decade ago. However, Jeffree’s behavior isn’t in the past. I suggest you view this link for a summary https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/BeautyGuruChatter/comments/bduvox/a_comprehensive_list_of_jeffree_stars_many/


As you can see, he’s a repeat offender and that doesn’t even cover this year. People who are genuinely sorry for the uneducated remakes they made in their youth do not continue to act the way he has.

He has a wide scope of influence and I do believe it’s my responsibility to not support someone who’s using their influence in such a negative manner."
8732,2020-11-08 17:10:19,jqf1gm,"The last time I bought his products, I was under the impression that he was growing from his past mistakes. Then more and more kept happening...and I wish he were a better person. He keeps getting caught doing the same exact things. I don’t know if I’ll ever buy from him again."
8733,2020-11-08 23:35:26,jqf1gm,"this is gonna sound mean but i dont mean for it to..

you say that you know that many people refuse to buy from his brand and why, so the only reason you’re posting here (which you hinted towards) is because you want to keep buying from him because you like his formula. but you also want people here to morally absolve you.

i don’t think anyone’s opinion here will genuinely change your mind. you need to reflect on your values and if you’re willing to turn a blind eye towards his patterns of behavior for makeup. i don’t support it, but it’s your choice to make. not mine or anyone else’s."
8734,2020-11-08 21:47:43,jqf1gm,"*When someone shows you who they are believe them* ~ Maya Angelou.



His apologies are disingenuous. He clearly doesn't want to educate himself, learn from his behaviour or show any level of decency towards woc. I'm not lining the pockets of a racist, especially when there are tons of great products out. Anyone who purchases from his brand is excusing racism."
8735,2020-11-08 22:54:32,jqf1gm,If you really want js products try and buy them second hand. That way you aren’t giving money to his company and you’re helping to reduce waste
8736,2020-11-08 22:04:18,jqf1gm,He is a POS. I wouldn't support him with your hard earned money. There are other places to get good makeup!

8753,2020-11-07 19:15:12,jpw4a6,Literally using POC as props. SMH.
8754,2020-11-07 20:07:48,jpw4a6,"Jesus the videographer was not on their game. The angles were distracting, especially when Jeffree wasn't staring directly at the camera. Also, why does Jeffree's voice sound a pitch higher? This whole video gave me QVC vibes. 

I do like the color story of the palette and there are some interesting lip and eyeliner colours. I hate that I love the packaging (mint green is one of my favourite colours). I'm not going to buy anything, but I can definitely appreciate how much work goes into the creative aspects of the collection. I wish Kylie Cosmetics gave this much attention and though to their recent product launches."

8759,2020-11-07 21:55:52,jpw4a6,"I've never liked him or purchased his products, but the palettes used to have a much better colour story. This looks like someone when to mac and picked up a bunch of mismatched singles. 

For someone whose always swimming in controversy, his releases are extraordinarily boring."
8760,2020-11-07 19:51:27,jpw4a6,"Funny how, since my first two replies on comments under this post, the thumbnail for the video has been changed from Jockey Strap surrounded by POC and now it's just him on a green screen 

Not all my predictions for the color story were correct, but the first three colors on the top left don't seem very promising on BIPOC (won't show up/ashy), as well as the two shades on the bottom left.

I am really underwhelmed by the color story, which I didn't think was possible for a collection of greens? According to the pics a user posted in the comments, the shades all look very bland and lack the flash and richness that attracted me to the Oceanic Palette by Ace Beauté (a palette I sought as an alternative to Blue Blood, but really works as an alternative for those two palettes of his). It baffles me how he excluded all the flashier and deeper greens/teal from this palette. But that's not like I intend to support him anyway, 

And the non-Jockey Strap-embossing is suuuuper tacky imo, especially that trendmood flying dollar emoji thing and the card. And I know that the hood embossing is supposed to represent people pulling a heist or sth, but to me it gives me Casper the friendly Ghost meets medieval executioner"

8782,2020-11-08 08:33:31,jpw4a6,Exactly! People used to make the argument that the makeup was so good it didnt matter - this does not look good.
8783,2020-11-08 14:25:38,jpw4a6,"Yup, I was feeling like Blood Money was meh and I couldn't pinpoint why, so I whipped out my Oceanic Palette and I immediately saw the difference in vibrance of colours (and mix of blue-based, khaki and yellow-based greens).

If you're looking for blue/green shades (not saying you have to, I'm aware a lot of people don't have much, if any, disposable income after 8 months of pandemic), I'd definitely recommend the Ace Beauté, it's well pigmented, under 40 USD and from an indie brand owned by a black woman (if you live in Europe, like me, you can get it through Beauty Bay)"

8799,2020-11-08 04:17:36,jpw2k4,The audio was off and he wasn't zoomed in much at all. He used to do live swatches and he super close to the camera. I think he's trying out a new way to record his reveals and I am not liking it at all lol.
8800,2020-11-07 22:40:49,jpw2k4,I was surprised he had to keep looking at the shade names. You’d think after putting over a year in to creating it you’d know. And yes the audio was off and it just seemed so impersonal. Idk. I love the palette but am kind of turned off by the staging.
8801,2020-11-07 19:50:12,jpw2k4,"I think it will, except the frosts and balm"
8802,2020-11-09 09:05:53,jpw2k4,"The difference is that he hasn't had to do that for a launch before. I get what you're saying, and that's true, but he's never had to do that in a video when launching a product of his own. He usually seems much more prepared in front of the camera. A launch video is a big deal.

Not disagreeing with you, just explaining where people are coming from."
8803,2020-11-08 02:34:28,jpw2k4,Yea something seemed off.. like he might be nervous about the launch’s performance or something else? Idk he didn’t seem as enthusiastic about it as he has about some of his past collections.
8804,2020-11-08 09:31:14,jpw2k4,Money grab

8813,2020-11-07 23:04:31,jps08o,"Sounds good, will PM!"
8814,2020-11-07 04:40:54,jpjpz0,"I agree she usually is not malicious, however the fact that within the same caption of the picture she included in the video contained evidence contrary to what she said is really strange. Literally the part about her not competing against women she cropped out; that just seems very sus to me. Also the thing with the overnight shipping vs ebook was super strange to me too."
8815,2020-11-07 17:21:21,jpjpz0,"I agree with pretty much everything you said except for a slightly different perspective.

For the book, I think it’s possible she got both copies. Maybe she realized reading her iPad was straining her eyes or whatever. I don’t believe she intentionally lied about reading it with ill will, but I believed she skimmed it like this was a high school reading assignment, possibly skipping entire chapters. This would explain why she missed a lot of the transphobic sections.

With the blackface tweet, I don’t believe it makes her a racist but I think it was a bad joke that she intentionally misrepresented when addressing it. 

Sometimes when she responds to influencers, she’s responding to people that have bad mouthed her or called her names. I think In these cases she should be able to do a sassy response video without feeling guilty. However, there were also instances of her doing it to random people so..

In the front of her consciousness, I don’t think she thinks she’s lying. She thinks she’s doing the right thing. But at the same time she is intentionally making up quotes for her thumbnails and twisting stories to make them fit her narrative and be more click baity. You see this A LOT with political extremists making Facebook posts or memes or whatever. The acts themselves ARE intentional and malicious from a certain perspective, but sometimes they don’t realize what they are doing is wrong.

Unfortunately though, the only reason they don’t think they are lying is because of a lack of self awareness, objectivity, and empathy.

For me, I’ve always admired Blaire for being so intelligent and well spoken, that I could overlook the times I didn’t agree with her. There’s no reason I need to agree with her on EVERYTHING to like her right? But what D’angello’s video showed me was that more than her being a liar or a meanie or whatever, she is just an incredibly untrustworthy narrator that does bare minimum research and isn’t aware of her own biases.

For me, that’s way way worse. It makes me feel like a fool for taking her at face value before.

Still, I don’t think she is evil at heart and hope she will grow and make better content in the future."
8816,2020-11-07 07:03:43,jpjpz0,"From my observation throughout the years I feel like she does what could be called maliciously lying, in videos at least. I don't think its to blackmail people or anything super nefarious, but rather just for drama/content or to validate her viewpoint(even if the viewpoint is correct). so more of a petty kind.  Oftentimes involves actively ignoring and hiding stuff that's literally on screen, so I think that goes beyond just doing bad research... Especially given how much time editing a YouTube video takes.

Not to mention there's been a lot of reactionary hypocrisy and attempts to silence criticism on her end as well. 

dont get me wrong I have been a long time fan and like her content, but this is always something I've noticed and has really bothered me, way before this whole current drama too. Especially as someone who cares a lot about integrity.

I don't think she deserves any hate but she does do a lot of behavior that needs to stop and certainly deserves some criticism."
8817,2020-11-09 22:43:20,jpjpz0,"I don't think anyone is saying she's a bad person. I think the main point is its impossible for all of these instances to be a mistake. Some of her lies are definitely intentional and she needs to be held accountable. She can no longer be considered the reliable, neutral and logical conservative youtuber that brings you the facts because she literally doesn't. Most of her subscribers are probably still gonna watch her videos thinking that conservatives like her are more honest than the left all while listening to a lying conservative"
8818,2020-11-16 14:16:13,jpjpz0,"I watched it as well, especially since both Blaire and D'Angelo are people whose work I really appreciate. And it was kind of a sobering video. I came to some different conclusions than him on several parts but the evidence laid out was still pretty comprehensive. 

At a certain point, I can't believe Blaire is ignorant about what she's doing. And I could support her more easily if I thought that. The thing is, though, I was fine supporting someone with opinions I don't always love. I was fine supporting someone who didn't always research well enough and made mistakes and was willing to admit them. But some of the recent stuff really does look like her lying and hiding from it. I have a harder time supporting a person who lacks integrity."
8819,2020-11-08 15:04:27,jpjpz0,"I guess like everyone, she's both good and bad, but she's been doing some messed-up shit that doesn't show her best side. 

The whole Janae thing clearly showed her bad intentions. In the end never forget that she has an agenda, whether you want to see it or not. 

You can say the same from other commentators and youtubers. Everyone is defending their point of view and she'll go as far as doing that shady video just to prove that ""omg the LGBTQIAXYZ+ community is going crazy and they need to be stopped"", especially since her last videos are always about showing controversial individuals under their worst light. It is done on purpose. 

The thing is, fine, she can expose these people if she wants and that's part of her agenda, the problem is when she does all these shady things to manipulate her millions of viewers. At this point all that is known about how she presented the information exposes HER as a nasty youtuber in my opinion. Why? Because she just doesn't care. She just wanted to take this opportunity to shit on Janae and other trans athletes. 

I still watch her content, but clearly gotta take it with a pinch of salt now. And I know, we all make mistakes and we can change, but here she proved that she is only showing what fits her own views and her own agenda regardless of who gets hurt or of all the consequences."
8820,2020-11-07 12:10:10,jpjpz0,Yeah he didn't really have much on her.
8821,2020-11-08 02:46:54,jpjpz0,[deleted]
8822,2020-11-07 05:32:07,jpjpz0,"I think she really did get the ebook but also bought a physical book and failed to explain that she got 2 copies. I also think she didn't even read the whole Instagram post tbh. Like some people will read a few sentences and assume they know what the rest is going to say and she really shouldn't have done that at all.
Edit: or someone sent her a cropped post and she failed to fact check it? I really give her the benefit of the doubt"
8823,2020-11-07 18:29:05,jpjpz0,I agree wholeheartedly
8824,2020-11-07 14:29:44,jpjpz0,"I agree here. I don't think she lied about Janae because she specifically wanted to hurt her or any of the other people she's done similar things to. I think she just wanted to get more attention and pander to her more far right fans without any regard one way or the other to the people she talked about. 

I could get behind OP if Blaire didn't willfully ignore the massive backlash the video got as soon as she uploaded it. Yeah, she can say she was used to ignoring the hate, but what hate? If you look at the comments on most of Blaire's videos, the reception is overwhelmingly positive. She does get a good amount of daily hate from crazy people, but the majority of her fans do not identify as left leaning and left leaning people don't watch her content. She would have known immediately that something was wrong. 

Because of this, I 100% believe that if a bunch of youtubers didn't call her out, she never would have apologized to Janae or even acknowledge the mistake, and that alone is kind of malicious."
8825,2020-11-09 23:28:29,jpjpz0,"Yeah I agree, she pretty much shot herself in the foot but I'll still watch for the pedos and predators getting exposed."
8826,2020-11-09 20:23:32,jpjpz0,Did you even read what OP wrote?
8827,2020-11-08 03:16:03,jpjpz0,So I see you agreed with everything D'Angelo said without using your head. Why bother commenting in this sub if you think that then?
8828,2020-11-07 14:20:30,jpjpz0,"Kat Blaque posted a comment on someone's video about the subject (I think one of iNabber's) saying she suspects Blaire relies on others for her information, which makes sense to me. It still doesn't excuse why she can't be bothered to fact check things. 

With the book thing, I don't understand why she would need two copies. If she's just a fan of JKR and just wanted a physical copy to display, why did it have to be overnighted? Why get the ebook at all? I know some people have an easier time reading hard copies, but if she can apparently read and comprehend a 900+ page book in 12 hours, she obviously wasn't hindered too much."
8829,2020-11-08 16:41:44,jpjpz0,"After reading your and my comments, it seems that my perspective isn’t different from yours at all. Just want to say again how much I completely agree with you.

Pushing the narrative that blaire is maliciously lying and spreading misinformation on purpose doesn’t really help anyone, and it will just make blaire defend herself more or dismiss criticisms as invalid. I hope that your perspective comes to light more in the future."
8830,2020-11-09 06:07:56,jpjpz0,"I mean, she does like to go for the antagonizing route a lot. Like when she was a trans elitist a couple years ago.

And I say this as a fan of her content."
8831,2020-11-08 03:19:05,jpjpz0,[deleted]
8832,2020-11-07 18:30:47,jpjpz0,"I think she skimmed through the book, tbh. That also clears things up, I figured she gets information from others."
8833,2020-11-08 04:17:48,jpjpz0,Literally get out of here you didn't even watch his video nor do you care enough to reply with any actual criticism. Also congratulations you exposed yourself for being a hater. Living rent free in her head.

8892,2020-11-03 18:07:26,jnfdq0,"So the other day, I was playing rainbow six siege, and I heard one of my teammates make a callout in the voice chat. It was a real life gamer girl. God, I kid you not, I just stopped playing and pulled my dick out. “fuck, Fuck!” I was yelling in voice chat. I just wanted to hear her voice again. “Please,” I moaned. But she left the lobby. I was crying and covered in my own cum, but I remembered that I could find recent teammates in the ubiplay friends tab. I frantically closed down siege and opened the tab, to find out she had TTV IN HER NAME!!! She was streaming, and only had 100 viewers!!! The competition was low, so I made the first move and donated my months rent to her. I was already about to pre. She read my donation in the chat. God this is the happiest I’ve been in a long time. I did a little research, and found out where she goes to school, but I am a little nervous to talk to her in person, and need support. Any advice before my Uber gets to her middle school?

8896,2020-11-03 22:27:52,jncv0b,I really love the D’angelo Wallace video. I love that he called himself on his own transphobic thoughts and apologized. It’s incredibly big of anyone who can call themselves on their own biases and seek to grow and change.
8897,2020-11-03 17:32:07,jncv0b,"Someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but is Tati's lawsuit with WOACB going to go anywhere? I understand how its defamatory, but isnt it all public information? I personally dont think going after gurus families is something drama channels should be doing. I know James (not Charles) is a pretty large part of Tati's brand and business, but I still find it really gross to dig up information from his past to make him look bad."
8898,2020-11-03 19:59:10,jncv0b,"Regarding Jaclyn I wonder if she partnered up with some other lab. And if she hired QA people that actually do their jobs and do not cut corners, I doubt at this point in her history that she would be there pacing and checking on everything every single day

Also lurking lowkey for the Tatianna lawsuit update. Like both of them"
8899,2020-11-04 03:38:33,jncv0b,Jaclyn tweeted about friendship breakups... wondering if this is about Jackie? Haven’t seen them interact in a while but that could be from the pandemic. Jackie isn’t following Jaclyn on Instagram anymore.
8900,2020-11-03 22:28:21,jncv0b,I really do love and appreciate D'Angelo
8901,2020-11-03 22:58:34,jncv0b,"I saw it too. I will have to sit again and watch it back, got to it right after workout so had almost no emergy to digest. Loved the comment section and Kat Blaque's sight on the inside of times she used to share a community with Blaire. I hkpe I make sense, cardio gets hard sometimes on me lmao"
8902,2020-11-03 23:17:10,jncv0b,"Based on what I’ve seen in a few breakdowns with the lawsuit, I’m not entirely sure. Tati does have to prove everything she claimed is true and directly WOACB’s fault. 

You can’t claim defamation and emotional distress on someone for reporting true public facts of actions you did. So Tati can’t win a suit against WOACB for putting out a video covering a public lawsuit that Tati is in. 

However WOACB did admit to being fast and loose with facts and sometimes releasing untrue statements. Plus deleting tweets and videos makes her look guilty and generally isn’t a good look. 

Frankly these are two people with their names and reputations in the mud. This is a suit where no one is going to walk out looking pretty. Depending on Tati’s reason for the suit she may not look to settle."
8903,2020-11-03 17:36:56,jncv0b,Angelikaa video addresses this in depth!!! She really explains why what she's doing is not okayc
8904,2020-11-03 23:00:28,jncv0b,"Something can be not morally ok but perfectly legal. 

Frankly Angela kinda sucks with American law as per her most recent video where she doesn’t understand what a $25,000+ damage claim means in California. She thinks the investor only wants $25,000 in claims and doesn’t understand he just set up for an unlimited claims suit to potentially sue for millions in claims. 

Frankly she’s really not that credible when it comes to American law."
8905,2020-11-03 23:03:27,jncv0b,"In her video she admits she's not the best at American law. She was just a suggestion I had for something easy to understand regarding presenting opinions as facts. I wasn't sure about the legal amount or issues, but I did think she made a good point about how Katie can cross the line. Thanks for the info about her though! Do you have any other sources that I could watch to get more info?"

At the end of the day everybody's still human. Anybody can do nasty shit, and if it happens to be a gay guy, ignore the gay part (since it doesn't really matter) and hate him for doing nasty shit.

Personally my definition of homophobia or heterophobia is just hating whoever just for their sexuality. Both suck ass, why is it so hard to be a decent human being online? Even for a day?

I think that sub was cool (at first) but then it devolved when the toxic people got a hold of it. I guess it's mostly okay if you neglect to look into comments of a post or glance over some questionable stuff.

Though good for you for trying to move on from toxic places. It's tiring sometimes."

9008,2020-12-14 06:50:55,kcs8ag,Sad but true
9009,2020-12-14 01:26:35,kcmw0x,"Just ordered her the Conspiracy Palette and had to run.to her and beg her not to check our PayPal account even though I just want to tell her what I got here. 

Thanks for the reassurance friends."
9010,2020-12-14 01:10:57,kcmw0x,"So there are a number of pallets that have released in this time.    I would look at the conspiracy palette, the bloodlust palette, the orgy palette, and the blood money palette."
9011,2020-12-14 02:23:48,kcmw0x,Side note: this is super sweet and wholesome. Hopefully she loves it!
9012,2020-12-14 01:15:20,kcmw0x,https://jeffreestarcosmetics.com/collections/eyes/products/conspiracy-palette
9013,2020-12-14 04:21:37,kcmw0x,This is so sweet.   I hope she loves it!
9014,2020-12-14 03:37:04,kcmw0x,Can you describe what it looked like at all?
9015,2020-12-14 01:13:01,kcmw0x,The one you are referring to is the conspiracy palette. Truly my favorite and I already know she will love it!
9016,2020-12-14 01:49:13,kcmw0x,Too sweet. Too bad I'm too late because I would have suggested ordering from beautylish because their shipping is usually faster
9017,2020-12-14 01:13:07,kcmw0x,I very vividly remember they did two big pre orders for this particular palette( I'm glad I now know how to spell it😂) and they sold out in seconds and for months.
9018,2020-12-14 01:14:48,kcmw0x,"But definitely sounds like the conspiracy collection. There's the big one which is just called conspiracy, and then a smaller pallet."
9019,2020-12-14 00:59:56,kclbz9,You mean kinda like this sub and the bazillion J* posts?
9020,2020-12-14 04:06:51,kclbz9,They wouldn't keep doing it people didn't keep watching it tbf
9021,2020-12-13 23:56:53,kclbz9,You can just come out and say Peter Monn. Lol

9023,2020-12-14 02:13:44,kclbz9,And Trisha Paytas
9024,2020-12-14 02:21:08,kclbz9,"Or how their videos are this:

5-10 minutes intro/talking about sponsor

1 minute talking about something J\* or Shane or Tati tweeted (or sometimes it's a repetition of the clickbait title that they ""say people are saying everywhere"" but then they say ""I don't think that's the case"")

5-10 more minute outro/talking about sponsor or nothing that has to do with the actual video."
9025,2020-12-14 00:55:56,kclbz9,"A previous commenter said it already, but absolutely, and Peter Monn certainly comes to mind. 

Jeffree doesn’t do enough that is full, 30-minute report-worthy on a daily basis. And yet Peter’s channel is 80% focused on videos about the guy. He claims he doesn’t care about him, and doesn’t think about him and yet...he’s pretty much the only person that Peter talks about. 

I also find it strange that he gets so much praise and love across the subreddit and his own videos. His commentary, to me, often feels incredibly mean-spirited. Because he comments on Jeffree Star so often (whether he’s done anything newsworthy or not), the only thing that he fills that space with are comments about how “nobody cares what he’s doing,” or “he’s all alone,” or even worse, “he has nobody who cares about him.” 

I don’t really care if you vehemently think Jeffree Star is the lowest scum on the planet, but it’s gross to make the bulk of your commentary about someone how you feel they have absolutely not a person in the world who gives a shit about them on any level. That’s mean, it’s targeted at someone’s emotional center, and doesn’t have much to do with his day-to-day actions."
9026,2020-12-14 04:20:55,kclbz9,"I actively avoid content about those two now. I'm tired of it. We already know they're problematic, let me know if that changes. Outside of that, I don't care about what's going on with them."
9027,2020-12-14 02:38:17,kclbz9,"Their names get clicks. I stopped watching Peter mon for that reason, like even if nothing is going on with j* or SD, he'll make a video about whatever little thing that's happened and its like 5 seconds in a 25 min video 🙄"
9028,2020-12-14 11:56:45,kclbz9,Unpopular opnion: this post and comments (also mine) also fuels discussion about them and do exacly what drama channels. Just stop people!
9029,2020-12-14 12:58:20,kclbz9,"I was a fan of Peter Momn but the attitude towards Morgan shocked me. At the end of the apology he said ""so that's it"" why bother addressing it if it was begrudged. I'm starting to think he is not bothered about their awful behaviour, deep down its because he thought he was in with their gang but they didn't want him. He should see that as a lucky escape but his bitterness stands in the way."
9030,2020-12-14 15:46:09,kclbz9,"They probably are sick of it but they know that people are gonna eat up that content, and gotta make that $$$"
9031,2020-12-14 03:37:37,kclbz9,"It's annoying.. but they gotta get their money someway. 

Think of it like mainstream shit on the tv.. people are so sick of the Kardashians, but holy fuck do they tune into KUWTK so much it went to HOW MANY seasons? Just cos someone made a shitty bloody home porn that got released lol. 

There's just certain cesspools of humanity, that make money for you when you use their name. And shit, I see nothing wrong with profiting off them when I can just choose to never watch the channels obsessed with lying such as Peter Monn about how over the drama they are.. when the only reason they exist is drama lol."
9032,2020-12-14 01:45:50,kclbz9,"Really proves how drama runs this community and the social media. It's really sad how drama and toxicity is rewarded. 

I think there needs to be a fundemental change with the algorithm"
9033,2020-12-13 23:51:12,kclbz9,"I totally agree!! I also find it annoying when they take screenshots of people's comments and say ""please don't send hate over to them"" but yet they don't blur out their username... D: like its asking for those die hard fans to find those usernames and bully them smh."
9034,2020-12-14 08:05:32,kclbz9,The irony is staggering
9035,2020-12-14 01:27:04,kclbz9,"I don't really see a problem. They're doing it for views and money (even if they just genuinely enjoy doing it), so of course they'll make videos on whomever gets the views. I assume running a channel is a lotta work and personally, if I can do the same amount of work for more money, then yeah, that's what I'll be doing even if it's not as fun or interesting to me."
9036,2020-12-14 00:03:15,kclbz9,"Drama channels are in it for the money so the ones that produce the most drama are their favorite. Favorite to hate or favorite to love, or switch between hating or loving them whichever gives them more views and makes them more money

I don’t care what they say, J* pays all their bills, the ones on his payroll and the ones not on his payroll. None of them wants him cancelled"
9037,2020-12-14 11:11:46,kclbz9,"Angelika is another one that does this. I’m not fans of J* or Shane either, but the hate is really intense on them and I feel like all these channels keep talking about how they don’t want them to get views etc but then they literally talk about them 24/7 and its gross"
9038,2020-12-13 23:32:03,kclbz9,This is so true. It’s also the same with Trisha Paytas.
9039,2020-12-14 09:07:41,kclbz9,I think the tide is turning and people are sick of the big drama channels now. The era has come to an end and people are sick of the same topic discussed over and over again.
9040,2020-12-14 20:04:15,kclbz9,They need to make money somehow tbh.  Its a cycle where is beneficial for everybody except for the people that want let go js and sd because youtube keep promoting drama videos related to them 🤣
9041,2020-12-14 05:20:35,kclbz9,"Popular opinion lol. Yes, this is so annoying. Certain others in the mukbang community are the worst at it, and I just won't click the videos as I truly do not have the capacity to tolerate them."
9042,2020-12-14 08:07:37,kclbz9,"I agree. Not just drama channels, but even random videos like anti-hauls. ""Obviously not going to get the Green Money palette because I don't support JS"" Well then don't mention him?"
9043,2020-12-14 15:34:03,kclbz9,"Let's face it, those drama channels are a serious guilty pleasure. But do we really respect the people giving the news? I know I don't. I could never respect a person who goes on camera and discusses other people's lives/drama. I know these scandals are public knowledge but it seems so desperate and gross to me. Like this is what you do with your life? Talk about other people? Yikes."
9044,2020-12-14 04:19:00,kclbz9,"I hate the term “cancel culture.” These two deserve to be cancelled...


Edit: I see the j*/shane stans are out. Question, what’s it feel like supporting a pedo and a racist? Wouldn’t be me."
9045,2020-12-15 00:12:15,kclbz9,"Let's be honest here...those videos get views so why wouldn't they make them? Peter Monn even comes out and says that. I actually like Peter because I think he is straight forward about this drama channel being what it is. Don't be fooled, JS, Shane, Ryland, Morgan etc WANT this coverage because it reminds people that they are still around. It also drives traffic to their channels. Most of these people got lucky on YT, they aren't particularly talented or charismatic in any way.  But, they are still becoming a lot less relevant even with drama channel coverage. IDK, I don't watch any other drama channels but those names get views. Aside from that, that whole group is so shady I can't bring myself to feel sorry for them when they are loving the attention, negative or otherwise. I have noticed a big shift towards following Instagram because the content is much better. But, yeah, the interest is dying and it is long overdue and hopefully we won't hear about them much anymore."
9046,2020-12-15 04:28:04,kclbz9,the consumer-brained defense in this thread REAKS and yall are only setting yourselves up to get scammed by influencers lol
9047,2020-12-14 01:16:29,kclbz9,"Honestly it used to be a lot, but it's definitely gone down a decent amount recently. Which is nice."
9048,2020-12-14 01:54:52,kclbz9,You read my mind!
9049,2020-12-14 16:41:33,kclbz9,Came here for this
9050,2020-12-14 06:03:35,kclbz9,"Him, but also a lot of other commentators have brought them up time and time again, dragging them to filth. I understood it at first, but it’s become overkill now in my opinion haha"
9051,2020-12-15 09:39:05,kclbz9,"That’s actually a great idea, he should totally branch out and do other Internet personalities and even celebrities, it would bring out the fun side in him I think."
9052,2020-12-14 06:48:24,kclbz9,"She’s the “Christian” that posts nudes on only fans, but loves to spew hate. I pity her. She is such a fuck up."
9053,2020-12-14 05:29:32,kclbz9,"the 10 min limit thing to get $ is the worst thing to happen to YT. 

you guyssss, this is just so crazy with Shane...  he tweeted he's getting STARBUCKS... is this SHADE at Jefree??!!!!!"
9054,2020-12-14 16:04:49,kclbz9,You mean Rich Lux? 🙊
9055,2020-12-14 01:28:52,kclbz9,Lmao Peter drives me nuts cuz he pads his videos with so much unrelated stuff then gets mad when people ask for a time stamp in the comments.
9056,2020-12-14 01:32:16,kclbz9,I could watch someone talk shit about JStar all day. IF it had substance to it and wasn’t just a bunch of word salad. I think that’s why he’s losing subs. Not because of the thing where YouTube randomly unsubscribes peope
9057,2020-12-14 04:31:01,kclbz9,[deleted]
9058,2020-12-14 23:50:07,kclbz9,"I like Peter Monn well enough, he can be a nice bit of mental junk food at the end of a long day, but dude needs to branch out. At first the constant J* posts were interesting as there was some drama to report. Then they kind of became an in joke, and now it's just done."
9059,2020-12-14 05:27:37,kclbz9,"Easy to see what Peter prioritizes when he mentions J* being alone, nobody cares about him. Peter uses his husband as a trophy himself. It's the only thing that he feels makes him better than J*.

Sure, watch Peter if you have no mind of your own and want to blindly follow a bitter, self centred hypocrite living a pointless life. 

Anyone who stans him is an idiot. Peter is bigger trash than Trisha."
9060,2020-12-14 08:46:17,kclbz9,"If people stopped clicking them entirely and adding to the view count, maybe the creators would realize those topics aren't worth pursuing anymore and find some new material."
9061,2020-12-14 13:19:57,kclbz9,"The exact reason I stopped watching Peter and unsubscribed is because it's all Jeffree, Jeffree, Jeffree or Shane.  I'm over them.  I did watch part of the Morgan video and afterwards I was mad at myself because I gave him a view."
9062,2020-12-15 08:14:30,kclbz9,He says people unsubbing was a glitch in his channel.
9063,2020-12-14 20:31:30,kclbz9,"yeah she and peter are really annoying because i want to watch videos about new news or new things that have happens but angelika especially is always so late and both peter and her post click bait titles that make me think it’s new drama when it’s the same
old tired news."
9064,2020-12-14 05:31:03,kclbz9,it pisses me off when it's people being held accountable for their actions!
9065,2020-12-14 06:35:10,kclbz9,He’s the only one I watched and I really don’t anymore. I’m not interested in his other content either
9066,2020-12-14 10:45:15,kclbz9,Isn't it a 8 min limit now?
9067,2020-12-14 05:28:56,kclbz9,"To piggyback on the selfish and bitter comment...I think this can be seen in how frequently he speaks about being excluded from the initial PR sent out for the Conspiracy collection. For someone who isn’t hung up on, or bitter about it, he comments about it all the time. On some level, I genuinely think that he wanted to be acknowledged and welcomed by Shane and Jeffree at the height of their success. And when that didn’t happen, he did an about face and now his channel is basically an exercise in shitting on Jeffree, Shane, and anyone attached to them (Morgan, Ryland, etc.) on a daily basis. 

If part of the Without A Crystal Ball drama revolves around her seemingly personal vendetta against Tati, and the sheer number of videos she made about her in comparison to other creators...I don’t see how this same observation couldn’t be made of Peter. He doesn’t do the level of invasive digging that WOACB did, but the sheer number of videos surrounding Jeffree could absolutely be presented as a pattern of behavior indicative of online stalking or harassment. 

What’s more - and this may not be received entirely well by all - but I believe he uses his status as a recovering addict as a way to shield himself from some of the criticism observed in this thread. The way it is mentioned or brought up in almost every video makes it feel very much like a ploy to garner sympathy. When he does respond to criticism, it’s often prefaced by more posturing about his struggles with addiction. And while I would never advocate for someone criticizing anyone for their struggles with addiction - it’s being used as a straw man argument by Peter to deflect from when he’s just being an ass hole. Your being in recovery isn’t a deflection tool to not address being bitter and gross."
9068,2020-12-15 00:15:08,kclbz9,what did he say about Morgan in the video? and how did he apologize? sorry i haven't seen anything about this but the thought of going through his videos to find out sounds exhausting
9069,2020-12-15 03:09:10,kclbz9,"I have to agree. Even when he covers Jaclyn or JC, he doesn't bother to actually research or understand the situation and basically talks about something knows 1% about. I couldn't take him saying he wasn't a bully while being a bully one more time."
9070,2020-12-14 10:24:31,kclbz9,[deleted]
9071,2020-12-14 17:16:50,kclbz9,Agree. And Peter should be careful. Someone might dig up his not-so-spotless past.
9072,2020-12-14 20:34:15,kclbz9,i feel like the WACB drama is different because she alleged so many defaming statements as fact. i’ve never seen peter do that but i could be wrong. he makes way too many videos about J* but none are actually defamatory like WACBs were. most notably stating that tatis husband essentially murdered his mother and preformed elderly fraud.
9073,2020-12-15 00:37:16,kclbz9,"He basically shamed her for not uploading enough and said if he can find time to upload to his six channels, then she surely could do the same, completely ignoring any of her mental health struggles and minimizing her feelings. I had trouble watching it but was just shocked how much he was pulling out of his ass."
9074,2020-12-14 10:25:55,kclbz9,........ because everyone on Twitter and Reddit is saying the same... lol 😆
9075,2020-12-15 23:23:51,kclbz9,"I’m talking mainly about Peter’s racist and disgusting tweets, as well as the disparaging things he said about former “clients” of his on Twitter."
9076,2020-12-15 23:57:30,kclbz9,"oh i didn’t know about any of that, can you explain briefly what happened?"
9077,2020-12-16 14:05:30,kclbz9,"Here is a link on GG.

There's a lot. Keep scrolling to the bottom.

Several people did videos on it.  
Just search ""Peter Monn tweets"" on youbube.

Peter was an ADULT when he said these things. Not a teenager, not in his 20s, and he was already SOBER and in ""the program"" that he talks about incessantly in his vlogs, how ""the program"" has made him accountable, how he's always doing ""inventory"".  He's so full of BS it's pathetic."

9134,2020-12-12 02:44:20,kbexsn,"Juvia’s Place always and forever. Such a good price, the pan sizes are huge, and the pigment is AMAZING. They’re stick foundation and concealers are also bomb. 

I also got Tati’s palette and it’s been amazing."
9135,2020-12-12 00:51:24,kbexsn,"Actually I would say that I prefer her smaller palettes to her big ones. I own 11 palettes from her so I've been able to compare and I'm constantly disappointed by the quality in her bigger palettes. 

If you are more of a nude lover, her Nude Obsessions palettes are amazing, I own 2 out of the 3 and I constantly use them when I do a neutral look. 

If you are interested in her colourful palettes, I love the blue one and the red one. The green and the purple ones are good but they are more finicky in my experience.

The big Norvina palettes are a dream, I own the first three and they knocked it out of the park for the quality in the mattes. The shadows are super pigmented, blendable and quite easy to work with, the quality is just top notch. If it's your first time with colourful eyeshadow, you could get overwhelmed but as long as you build your looks slowly, you'll end with amazing results. I don't know if it's still available, but I would also highly recommend the Jackie Aina palette, it looks a bit neutral but you can create quite outstanding looks with it. 

If you decide to get the big Norvina palette, keep in mind that the shimmers are disappointing. They aren't impactful enough in my opinion, they lack shimmeriness and their base is transparent so I'd suggest pairing the palette with other shimmers you like more. 

I would also advise you to ask for more opinions on r/MakeupAddiction. People on there have a lot of recs and different opinions for you to make a more informed decision if you want 😉

Edit : contrary to popular belief, Morphe isn't such a hot brand. Their palettes are very hit and miss, some are really pretty yes, but most of the times you can get much better for a lower price. Just look at BH Cosmetics' latest palettes if you want great quality for a cheaper pricetag."
9136,2020-12-12 03:33:42,kbexsn,"Disclaimer: I like my eyeshadow colors to be bright and fun, so I own no fully neutral palettes.

The Huda Obsessions are great if you have difficulty deciding on a look from a bigger, more varied palette. I'm in love with the gemstone collection right now.

For a larger palette, I just bought the BPerfect Carnival 3 after seeing it mentioned as one of Robert Welsh's favorite products, and it's SO good. The formula is excellent and there's a huge variety of gorgeous colors. I've been experimenting with so many looks with just this palette, and I didn't even get the XL version."
9137,2020-12-12 02:25:32,kbexsn,I'm a fan of the Huda obsessions palettes!
9138,2020-12-12 04:56:51,kbexsn,"ABH Soft Glam is a good choice for a neutral palette. I love the Huda Beauty New Nudes and Mercury Retrograde palettes. They are soft, pigmented, the mattes are not patchy, the shimmers are stunning, and just high quality all around."
9139,2020-12-12 16:52:07,kbexsn,I like EBIN’s Secret of Pharaoh eyeshadow palettes. Totally under rated. Their shadows are super pigmented. Comparable to high end palettes. My favorite one is the Desert Rose but I also love Sand Storm which is very neutral. https://www.ebinnewyork.com/collections/secret-of-pharaoh
9140,2020-12-12 02:32:08,kbexsn,"I've been using the Coastal Scents 88 pallet in regular and shimmer for almost a decade. 176 shades, I'm covered"
9141,2020-12-16 17:48:08,kbexsn,"If you haven't tried the Give Me Glow and Shroud Cosmetis eyeshadows, you haven't lived! The BH Cosmetics Travel Collection palettes (except Trendy in Tokyo), Weekend Vibes Collection paletes, Naughty palette (Holiday launch), and (aparrently, cause I haven't gotten my hands on em yet) the Sweet Shoppe palettes have A++ quality. Juvia's Place keeps killing it. Just 10/10 for all these brands."
9142,2020-12-12 04:56:15,kbexsn,"As crazy as this may sound, I really love the Revolution Color Book series. The colors are all on point, they are really creamy, and they are cheap enough that I don't feel like I blew money (I spent like $30 for 3 big palettes and I use them all pretty regularly). Like they're not the best for like a daily palette but if you want a specific shade set you can almost always find it in the palettes. I use purples, red, and greys/blacks a lot (I'm goth asf) so the palettes usually cover all that.

Also the UD wired palette is amazing for vibrant colors if you need them. Like the red, pink, and cyan are some of my favorite shades of all time"
9143,2020-12-12 04:29:12,kbexsn,"Check out Ace Beautē as well!

Edit: I also don’t like the smaller Huda palettes."
9144,2020-12-12 19:49:25,kbexsn,Thank you! I will go check out :) x
9145,2020-12-12 08:59:57,kbexsn,What do you mean when you said the green huda palette is finicky? Just asking as it’s the one I’ve been eyeing up for a while
9146,2020-12-12 19:54:57,kbexsn,"Thank you so much for your detailed reply :) I usually like a nude look for everyday, so I will check these out! I've been eyeing up the new nude pallet as I love the neutral pink tones so I might go for this one and see how I get on before getting one of the smaller palettes. 

With the norvina palette I think I'll need to make a decision between which one to get before purchasing. I love the vol 2 and vol 3, not so much the vol 1 as I'm not a purple person. 

I totally agree about morphe. I wasn't too impressed with the 2 palettes that I got. I purchased the james charles morphe palette recently but not had a chance to play about with it yet. I've heard mostly positives about this one x"
9147,2020-12-12 19:56:56,kbexsn,"Oh thats great! I love a big palette that has so much choice!

 I love Robert Welsh so if he says its good then it must be. I'll need to check this one out too :) thank you! X"

9150,2020-12-19 21:05:10,kbexsn,I second givemeglow! I bought the Juicy Olive palette not too long ago and its gorgeous!
9151,2020-12-12 10:30:14,kbexsn,"They require more work. I find that I need to build up the colour slowly and add a few layers to get the punch if colour I want. It's especially the case with the lighter shades, they get patchy easily. 

So yeah, they work but they're a bit more finicky 🙂 if you don't mind that and are aware of their shortcomings, they're still totally worth it IMO"
9152,2020-12-12 20:08:41,kbexsn,"In that case, for the Norvina palettes, you should ask yourself what you're more likely to wear : cool tones or warm tones ? The second one is very blue-heavy and it's also much darker in tone. The third one is very warm with a few pops of green. 

Personally, I wear a lot of dramatic makeup and I love the darker colour story in volume 2, but the quality is excellent in both so you won't go wrong with any of them 😉"
9153,2020-12-19 21:44:31,kbexsn,"Right?! I may or may not be on a mission to buy all of their singles, ngl..."
9154,2020-12-19 22:51:12,kbexsn,I know exactly how you feel! Im also really eye'ing the vivid rose palette. It's just soooo pretty!

9157,2020-12-11 21:51:00,kbbypa,"Colourpop! They have palettes for everyone's taste, preform well and are cheap. My personal favorite is ""I think I love you"" its a mix of warm nudes, easy to use shimmers and some deeper shades.

Anastasia is also a great brand. I love their renessanse palette, but it's a bit too loud and not an everyday going to work kind of palette. People love their soft glam palette but I don't personally own it"
9158,2020-12-12 00:22:23,kbbypa,Natasha Denona Mini glam or mini nude.
9159,2020-12-11 21:53:36,kbbypa,"Tarte has some really good neutral pallettes, which are not overpriced but also not affordable. 

I would say, if you don't want to break bank I would definitely look at Colourpop. They have a lot of variety, the quality of the shadows is amazing and they are really cheap for the quality. 

I have their Sweet Talk and Making Mauves pallettes and I get a lot of use out of both. 

Both company are cruelty free."
9160,2020-12-12 00:09:01,kbbypa,I see other people suggested colourpop and I would have to agree! They're amazing quality. I also like lorac shadows. Theyre super neutral and highly pigmented.

9162,2020-12-12 01:47:07,kbbypa,"I still stand by my UD Nakeds ;-; right now I have the Honey palette, I’ve been so happy with it! My biggest complaint is the price. Idk if I would buy it again at retail value, but I would probably say that about any palette over $40 lmao. that said, if you like warm neutrals and shimmery golds/coppers/bronzes, I highly recommend this palette 🍯

ETA - ABH modern Renaissance has been my go-to everyday shadow for about 5 years. Mixing the deeper reds with a brown shade can result in some really beautiful looks. If there is any product I will buy over and over, it’s that one !"

9170,2020-12-12 14:59:32,kbbypa,"If price isn’t a problem- Natasha denona and pat mcgrath are my favorite formulas. Soo beautiful, blendable and the pigment is amazing. 
If they’re too pricey for you- Anastasia Beverly Hills is my next favorite formula. Soft glam is the perfect everyday one. 
If your looking for even cheaper, colourpop and morphe are great options!"
9171,2020-12-12 15:20:06,kbbypa,"Budget friendly: Colourpop, BH cosmetics (love their travel themed palettes!), Juvias Place, morphe (I find a lot of their palettes hit or miss but if you’re starting out they’re still a shady brand but a better option then J*)

High end: ABH palettes- Jackie Aina has the wearable colorful palette it’s the best in my opinion but all the palettes are pretty good. Dose of colors - they have a lot monochromatic palettes, really good quality and good size. Sugar pill- super colorful looks and good shadows. Urban decay - born to run or any of the naked palettes are pretty good, I have a couple and still use them and love them. 

Luxury: Pat McGrath, Charlotte tilbury, Natasha Denona, Tom Ford."

9184,2020-12-11 07:24:42,kaxk1q,"Major internet personalities with large followings tend to present themselves in fake, curated ways. They heavily exaggerate themselves for the camera, and I don't blame anyone for finding that off-putting.

On the other hand, the human brain has this thing called Negativity Bias, which causes it to treat all negative thoughts & feelings as ""genuine"" and positive ones as ""fake"". This can easily lead one to assume that happy, cheerful people are that way because they're hiding ill intentions. It's especially hard to shake this feeling if you've ever been let down or betrayed by someone who otherwise seemed happy, or at least put on a cheerful affect.

I've been there many times, hope this is of some help"
9185,2020-12-13 13:11:26,kaxk1q,Is the idea of men wearing makeup the thing that makes you feel this way or just James and Jeffree specifically? I can understand about Jeffree but James looks normal and usually doesnt wear makeup
9186,2020-12-11 09:34:28,kaxk1q,I mean... pewdie pie is kind of a nazi so maybe you just have good instincts.
9187,2020-12-11 02:58:31,kaj9ov,what happened? Did you hear this for real?
9188,2020-12-10 08:34:20,kab1sh,As a survivor of sexualising assault I wish I could get compensation for the damage it did to my life however as my abuser isn't famous I get solid fuck all. I see this as J☆ acknowledging that he owed this person for the action he had made in the passed and im glad the person received some compassion and I hope has helped them heal.

9190,2020-12-11 03:40:40,k9zdem,"""picking on kids""

Kids that went around calling Brita, Jaida, and Widow racial epithets to the point of having to delete their social media temporarily and stop working for a while, but okay.

Gigi CHOSE to be the white person who refuses to acknowledge their privilege, and pull the ""politics is boring uwu watch me wear my costume"" garbage.


Edit: sorry, you're a white 19 year old kid? You have the last right to discuss racism, sorry. Gigi was rewarded with white exceptionalism despite her mediocrity in parts of the season. 
Defending PoC from younger fans isn't ""bullying,"" it's the right thing to do."
9191,2020-12-09 22:37:36,k9zdem,"Love the write up, but this is very much mild drama for the Ruple community. There’s no racial slurs, black face, bomb threats, physical and sexual abuse of fans, or many of the other earmarks of America’s Next Drag Drama Superstar."
9192,2020-12-10 17:33:39,k9zdem,Telling this story with Gigi as the protagonist was a choice
9193,2020-12-11 06:38:08,k9zdem,"As someone who deeply inhabits the spoiler part of the Reddit Drag Race community and who ran the S12 Tea Checker, thus being privy to inside info for that (& previous) seasons, I'd like to point out a couple of things which I think are important to anyone reading this fresh:

1. RuPaul still does choose the winner, it's his choice alone, not the fans
1. [Jaida's win was leaked by two people](https://imgur.com/a/CbN3JHJ) to /r/SpoiledDragRace on May 23. George Floyd was killed days later on May 25
1. Before Gigi ever made the insensitive comments during the George Floyd/BLM protests, Jaida was already picked as the winner

9196,2020-12-10 17:19:51,k9zdem,Lmao calling jaida some pageant queen with nothing spectacular then saying she was the most deserving winner. Fuck off be consistent.
9197,2020-12-10 00:10:31,k9zdem,">Jeffree is inherently a controversial figure

Isn't that just a euphemism for ""well-known slimeball""?

> her pal who actually has a personality that isn’t “smol awkward 2014 Tumblr bean”

And here I was starting to get the idea that anyone in or connected to that fanbase who wasn't a middle school girl on tumblr would still act like one."
9198,2020-12-09 22:34:17,k9zdem,"I think the reason people hated so much on Gigi is because everybody in the queer community knows more than their fair share of Gigis. Pretty, young, white privileged as fuck and willfully ignorant about what's going on in their own community.


In her season there was a black queen that talked about how she was afraid to drive her own car because of racism, in Canada's Drag race there was a queen that was FUCKING SHOT in a hate crime. When you are aware of these kind of stories, or even lived them yourself, it's really hard to sympathize with Gigi's ""not following news because it gives me anxiety"" while she has all the privileges a queer kid can ask for. It's fine to be grateful for your privileges, it's not fine to be blind to others oppression.



Also, Jeffree Star is not only ""controversial"" he is a known [racist misogynistic asshole, who called a black women ""gorilla"" and frequently used the n word](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyGuruChatter/comments/bduvox/a_comprehensive_list_of_jeffree_stars_many/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), the only reason he is not completely cancelled is because people like his make up brand."
9199,2020-12-10 05:39:26,k9zdem,"No mention of ""Look over there""? That was the best part of the season imo

It should be noted that GiGi filmed the collab with Jeffrey Star (a noted racist) **in person**, when she was supposed to be quarantining. What's worse, she was supposed to be running the Drag Race Instagram account for that day via Instagram stories. So she tried to hide it by posting very short stories and ended it abruptly, saying her phone died (or some other excuse I can't remember).

Regarding young gay male fans. I'm a gay male fan (not young anymore) and we prefer to thirst over queens who look more masculine out of drag, like Kameron Micheals. Surprise, gay men and straight women have different tastes."
9200,2020-12-10 13:35:41,k9zdem,"I was lucky enough to be involved with the caravan of people who celebrated Jaida's win in Milwaukee; she absolutely 100% deserved her win. Keep an eye on the House of Essence Hall; there's some really great talent in Milwaukee that's going under the radar, but having Trixie and Jaida both come from here is just the beginning."
9201,2020-12-09 20:26:47,k9zdem,"The Crystal erasure in this post...../s

I think it's all been a little harsh on Gigi. I think she's sort of safe and boring, she has some great looks but to be mad at her because she has a supportive mom who makes her looks, for example, is misplaced to me. She seems like the type of early 20something who doesn't know a whole lot of the world beyond her own nose, but knows how to use social media, influence, and fan reach to get things. 

Also Gigi or (ugh) Crygi fans are right up there with Trixie/Katya fans."
9202,2020-12-09 21:00:31,k9zdem,">the fandom eventually calmed down and stopped actively bullying children who hadn’t even entered high school yet

This right here. God knows the tween element of any fandom are annoying as fuck, but it's even more annoying when grown-ass adults stoop to their level."
9203,2020-12-10 22:53:30,k9zdem,"How does this post have awards it's wildly biased towards gigi and biased against jaidas actual talent and skills, and just overall a huge misrepresentation of how vile the rpdr fandom actually is"
9204,2020-12-09 21:26:40,k9zdem,"The RPDR fandom is truly one of the most toxic I've ever seen lmao. So much performative activism and ""progressiveness"" which is actually more regressive than anything else mixed with people constantly bitching about how mean and unfair the editing is and it's so awful that they make certain people the villain even though they love to hate someone the entire season and send them death threats and shit all while having very strong ""opinions"" on drag as an artform when their understanding of drag starts and stops at this show. This fandom loves to hate and tear down and divide and get angry at anyone who steps outside the norm when the entire concept of drag is to do the exact opposite. I feel like this fandom is the exact stereotype people have of gen-z, a bunch of young people that are ignorant and want to act all tough on the internet when they fall to pieces when anyone dares disagree with them at all. Still like the show but the fandom is so regressive and tiring to me, I see so many toxic traits that the LGBT community has had to fight against for generations, it all feels such a mess to me. :/"
9205,2020-12-10 12:59:02,k9zdem,... why do we give young reality tv show fans a pass for not knowing it's edited and scripted but we mock the idea of wrestling fans who don't know what kayfabe is?

I will say, though, that ""Chile..."" isn't Jaida's catchphrase. That's regular AAVE, so it's just how she talks. Even if she says that a lot, it's not like 'brown cow stunning' for Monique Hart. This is an actual term from the Black community. :)"
9211,2020-12-09 21:15:17,k9zdem,"as someone who was active in the drag race community at the time, i really don't think any of this is drama worthy enough for its own post, especially one as long in the word count as this one is. skinny white fan favourites fuck up every season, and this season's one wasn't even particularly entertaining to watch as it happened."
9212,2020-12-15 19:43:58,k9zdem,"Confused at the part where Jaida's loss was propelled by Gigi's lack of political know-how/lack of caring. In other parts of the Drag Race fandom, that translates to Jaida won b.c it's the year of BLM, which is a problem"

9216,2020-12-14 00:58:25,k9zdem,"So, according to your Beowulf analogy, Jaida's run on the show can be reduced to beating Sh*rry Pie in a lipsync? Sure Jan. If it makes you happy, Gigi will eventually be back for All Stars."
9217,2020-12-09 22:35:37,k9zdem,"I just read a long ass write up about Ru Paul's Drag Race.  That's not something I expected to happen when I woke up this morning.  While I doubt I'll start watching the show, your writeup was very entertaining."

9219,2020-12-10 10:29:23,k9zdem,Still not sure why you used “boy” or hand waved it off?  Isn’t Gigi an out NB?  Calling her a boy feels slightly transphobic.

9222,2020-12-10 09:59:39,k9zdem,"The Gigi Fandom was basically Season 7's Max Collective on steroids... Although Max didn't break any rules or offend anyone, she just got fucked over by her creepy werewolf ex-boyfriend/manager. Same type of fans though!"
9223,2020-12-10 04:39:43,k9zdem,"I really feel like ""I can't breathe"" is just a thing Gigi says. Weren't there like 2-3 instances of her saying it nonchalantly on her IG lives? Of course, saying it when she did made her look bad but I'm positive that she didn't even put much thought into what she was saying. 

I really sort of... disagree with some of OP's characterizations of the drama here. This feels like 3 different drama posts in 1, and an unnecessary one at that considering there's already an excellent writeup of the Sherry Pie drama here from months ago."
9224,2021-01-25 17:09:13,k9zdem,Pretty obvious bias in this but it was a fun read so I can live with it.

9240,2021-04-04 21:01:12,k9zdem,it’s really hard to continue reading this post when you keep referring to Gigi as a boy. it’s clearly apparent that you watched the season so you have heard or know Gigi is non-binary. they’ve even talked about it on the show. it’s incredibly upsetting that you refuse to acknowledge them by their true gender.

9261,2020-12-10 13:55:59,k9zdem,"Oh my god, that caravan was amazing! You guys were so sweet to her, she is 100% a deserving winner."
9262,2020-12-09 21:13:54,k9zdem,"Yeah, I think her mom being proud and involved is really fantastic! 

I do kind of discount some of her wins though, since it's someone else work *and* someone else's taste that went into creating her looks. It kinda sucks that some queens are creating or at least commissioning and purchasing their clothing and props while others have friends and family supplying them for free. But that's a separate issue and Gigi's not the only one with that advantage."
9263,2020-12-09 21:00:20,k9zdem,">to be mad at her because she has a supportive mom who makes her looks, for example, is misplaced to me

This really rubbed me the wrong way as well.  I understand the frustration that she doesn't seem to understand that other queer folks experience more day-to-day homophobia than she does, but my god isn't it a *good* thing that we're at a point where there are young queer people who haven't been rejected by their families and are able to live happy and authentic lives?

I love Drag Race, but the trauma porn does get to be too much sometimes.  This seems like a natural outgrowth of that tendency.  Not only does a successful contestant need to have a tragic backstory to share, someone without a tragic backstory should be actively rooted against because apparently that makes them a bad person?"

9274,2020-12-10 14:21:48,k9zdem,"It’s neither. The winner of the competition is revealed live, way after filming has wrapped. All of the finalists film a winning scene during finale shooting, if there won’t be a live finale, and then the winner is edited in for the broadcast. The winner of the competition finds out at the same time as the fans."
9275,2020-12-10 23:56:33,k9zdem,"They don’t know, and this year would’ve been extra hard. Like I mentioned, usually, whoever makes it to the final lipsync can kinda tell who’s winning. For example, Brooke Lynn, last years runner up, said in interviews that she knew she’d lost to Yvie after filming ended. Even before they starting doing the lip sync for the crown finale, this was true. For example, Bianca Del Rio, season 6 winner, seemed to have a clear idea that it was really down to just her and Adore.

It’s possible that just due to pure circumstances of who has won the past few seasons, the winners themselves may not know going into it anymore. After all, Aquaria was not the badass queen of intellect she is now when she won season 10 at just 21, and Yvie is... not the best with social cues. 

But usually, once the finale is filmed, at least 1/2 of the girls will have a feeling who won, just from watching the show and seeing the edits."

9279,2020-12-10 13:14:45,k9zdem,"Ah, I am sorry about that. I am a white teen, as the person noted below me, and had never heard the phrase before Jaida. She sort of popularized it amongst drag race fans, which is probably why I misattributed it to her."
9280,2020-12-10 01:37:43,k9zdem,"Yeah like... compared to the Sherry Pie drama the Gigi stuff is super mild. None of this was big drama at all, really."
9281,2020-12-10 00:12:46,k9zdem,"Yeah and every season OP talks about, they say “**we** bullied [whoever]”. **They’ve** been part of the bullying, toxic hivemind every season but *this* season it’ll be totes different!!! 

Every off-season, the dust settles, (most) viewers chill tf out once they’re not watching their chosen “villain” queen every week (&, if we’re talking about awful fans and season 12, Brita was way more unfairly bullied in this season than GiGi...), and then start a big outcry about “how could the fandom treat her like that??!!! This must never happen again!!!!” and then next season they pick a new target or two and are fucking relentlessly awful, and it’s just a horrible cycle 

OP says all this now but almost certainly will be back to their usual watching patterns 🤷‍♀️ happens literally every season"
9282,2020-12-09 21:42:55,k9zdem,"Agreed. I don't really feel like there are any consequences or specific drama here other than ""the fans of one queen were annoying and other fans mocked them."" Especially because this is soooo long. It presents a lot of things as FACTS that simply aren't, like ""85%"" of GiGi support turning up on cringe subs, what feels like a lot of implication that people liked Jaida only because she wasn't SP or GiGi, or the thing about why GiGi was cut from the tour. MAYBE the ""I can't breathe"" thing combined with all of the rumors that GiGi shot originally shot her video in a studio, but it's all diluted in so much unnecessary commentary."
9283,2020-12-09 22:31:09,k9zdem,"thank you, i was also confused how 75% of this post could be about nothing, until I realized OP just wants to kiss gigi's feet a bunch"
9284,2020-12-10 02:12:37,k9zdem,"I've never watched it before but I thought it was an interesting read! OP is right, it's a good fit for outsiders which means it's perfect for this sub.

9285,2020-12-10 03:56:09,k9zdem,"It's fun drama for those of us outside it.  I mean, we had a drama post about a subreddit that got its panties in a twist over a mod and split into two and that was about as dramatic as making a cup of tea and forgetting to put the tea packet in first."
9286,2020-12-09 21:17:44,k9zdem,"It’s interesting to outsiders though. 

Though honestly, someone needs to write up a whole ass post on the absolute clusterfuck that was season 11, from the Branjie girls to how awful we treated Silky, that season was a mess."

9288,2020-12-15 19:48:24,k9zdem,"That’s not my intent at all. The meaning is, by being a dumbass in such a grandiose way, GiGi made herself unable to win. If GiGi hadn’t been a dumbass on Twitter, who knows what would’ve happened. After all, she really was production’s favorite, and usually, that’s who wins, with Jaida being a close second.

Moral of the story: don’t act the fool online until after you win, especially not if there’s another person almost as beloved as you by the judges."

This is nothing."
9292,2020-12-09 21:06:27,k9zdem,"As am I. 

But that doesn’t mean her kiddie fan girls deserved to be picked on by a bunch of bored adults on Reddit this spring, and I hope to God we as a community can treat them better when they inevitably return for Symone, and instead focus on calling out and removing the racist parts of the fanbase."
9293,2020-12-10 21:32:40,k9zdem,"To be fair, she just seemed very proud of it, and it is very important to her, looking back on it now having known about her for the 6 months or so after the season. Their relationship is genuinely so sweet. She’s the youngest of 3 boys, and her mom’s a costumer, so they probably bonded over her being the only one really interested in costumes and sewing as a kid. The pictures of her as a little kid in what look like homemade princess dresses are really adorable. 

However, emotions tend to run high in season anyways, and with the added stress 2020 was, I can definitely understand why that tight knit bond they share being brought up a ton by GiGi rubbed older fans who might not be as fortunate as her the wrong way."
9294,2020-12-10 00:33:09,k9zdem,"Believe me, we all did. 

This is minor drama compared to what normally goes down with this fandom, as you’ll notice from the commenters telling me that, but I don’t know enough about some of the more serious incidents that have happened, and I wanted to post on here, so I wrote what I felt comfortable explaining without missing out key points of the drama or misunderstanding/miscommunicating somethings importance."

9296,2020-12-10 07:03:02,k9zdem,"Just because she didn't put much thought into what she was saying doesn't mean it didn't have the same impact when it was said. The harm was still caused, and if it makes her 'look bad', think about what people *felt* in response to what she wrote for her to have something to 'look bad' about.

""I can't breathe"" in the midst of BLM protests hitting a peak after George Floyd's murder takes prominence over it being 'a thing she says'.

And I'm not gonna pass up perfectly good content. :P If you're saying we should have *more* content out this too, I'm here to read it, but I wouldn't call this unnecessary if a bunch of people found it entertaining."

9298,2020-12-09 22:41:00,k9zdem,"* Sherry Pie is exposed as a sexual predator right at the start of the season.
* Leaks reveal Sherry would have been edited to be a fan favorite and likely made it to the finale; last minute edits to the start of the season have Jaida win and eliminate Sherry
* This establishes Jaida as a fan favorite, especially among 'older' fans
* Gigi Goode, being young and hot in both male and female presenting form, attracts a younger, newer fanbase to the show
* Aforementioned 'older' fans get annoyed by this, setting up a Jaida vs Gigi narrative in both the show and amongst the fanbase
* Gigi has several tonedeaf moments related to queer and political issues
* Jaida and Gigi make it to the finale. Signs point to Gigi winning. Queens film their finale performances from home; Gigi attempts to use LA studio space for this, being based in LA, but gets forced to refilm at home by producers as this breaks the rules
* The final blow - Gigi tweets 'I can't breathe' on Twitter as an expression of excitement at the same time as it is trending due to the murder of George Floyd. Issues a tonedeaf apology for it.
* As speculated, because of this, Jaida wins and not Gigi. 

I hope that's ELI5 enough for you, hahah."
9299,2020-12-09 21:41:11,k9zdem,"Truly. I'm a big fan of the show and the drama could be explained in a couple hundred words maybe. Nothing about it is interesting enough to warrant a 4,000 word novella."

 Although, unlike the aforementioned Miss Goode, these TikTok white boys who became adored by teenagers for simply being eye candy decided to throw massive parties during a global pandemic instead of simply saying dumb shit on the internet."

9307,2020-12-09 21:30:17,k9zdem,I mean there's a long history of vicious racism in the Drag Race fandom which really is a lot worse than whatever happened with Gigi or her fans.

9312,2020-12-10 15:30:34,k9zdem,"They did, but those were often adults on Reddit. Not the kids making Instagram edits that were reposted and mocked. 

I haven’t been involved in that much of the drama arguing with those particular sections of the GiGi fans, but I was unfortunately involved in bullying the kids instead of the racists, as I’ve confessed. 

The fandom needs to do a better fucking job of realizing what our problems are. Yes, the influx of young fans can sometimes cause real issues (see Branjie), but it’s the deep rooted racism we need to check, not the fucking children calling a queen their “uwu smol bean” ."
9313,2020-12-10 18:06:21,k9zdem,I think you may not have the perspective needed to fully appreciate this. You’re talking about Gigi’s young fans when you’re a child yourself.
9314,2020-12-11 03:45:04,k9zdem,12/13 year olds should not be watching RPDR jfc.

9316,2020-12-10 15:00:15,k9zdem,"Jaida was the clear front runner for me from episode 1...heck, even in the promos. She is incredibly talented, beautiful, and smart. Please don’t diminish her win. She won because she deserved to win and was better than Gigi and Crystal in overall performance on the show."
9317,2020-12-11 22:09:41,k9zdem,"So, she didn't win because of that but won a little because of that?"
9318,2020-12-11 16:35:13,k9zdem,"Yeah girl, but not on the same post lmao"
9319,2020-12-10 06:55:03,k9zdem,"You don't have to be polite about a very well-documented racist, though."
9320,2020-12-10 15:44:02,k9zdem,"GiGi Goode is, as commenters and I have both noted, widely regarded as one of the most privileged queens by older fans. From her being white and conventionally attractive in and out of drag, to even her amazing relationship with her mom, she has privilege a lot of queer folks don’t.

So when she said she “doesn’t like the news because it makes me anxious”, it came across as a refusal to self educate. I don’t think it helped that she came onto the scene two years after Aquaria, who, similar to GiGi, was the youngest that season and seen as kind of a “brat” when she was first introduced, but later found a powerful voice for activism, either."

as a gay guy who's had a lot of his female friends develop crushes on him explicitly bc they're sexually non-threatening, this is SUCH a thing

straight men are scary sure, but i can't help but feel tumblr/disney/tween girl culture alienates straight women from them so much that they become detached from their own sexuality a bit, to the point where they're more into specifically people who don't reciprocate those emotions"
9323,2020-12-10 13:31:14,k9zdem,"THIS! Oh my god, this. Supernatural fandom back in the day was 100% this. They were all like, dad aged men. The next logical step would be younger guys who are gay, and therefore non threatening."
9324,2020-12-09 21:41:39,k9zdem,"It makes me miss early seasons of Drag Race, where by and large the queens were making/finding looks on their own and not shopping out to specific drag designers."
9325,2020-12-09 22:00:59,k9zdem,"Agreed, I wish they did a lot more DIY look challenges, or at least had some way of reining in the reliance on pricey designers."
9326,2020-12-09 22:01:54,k9zdem,"I think the issue also is that her looks are very “safe” and aren’t very draggy. There was nothing very exciting about any of them, they’re just Instagram looks that aren’t very imaginative.


They weren’t bad looks by any means they just don’t scream “drag”. I don’t dislike Gigi I think she just comes across as someone playing dress up rather than someone invested in the art of drag."
9327,2020-12-09 21:57:35,k9zdem,"It’s not about having a tragic backstory (I don’t recall Jaida having one although perhaps she did) it’s about knowing your community and it’s history and being a good representative of that community.


Gigi never showed any affinity for activism or for even wanting to understand “older gay culture” and that’s going to rub people the wrong way.


Drag Race is a HUGE platform, you’re going to be representing drag and LGBT culture to the masses, it’s expected that you be more than a mannequin for fashion and actually be engaged in the issues affecting your community. At the minimum you have to show you can understand and empathise with the people who lived through the AIDS crisis, people who fought for marriage equality etc


It’s not that you have to have been bullied or lost people to AIDS, but you have to understand that these are the foundations of our community and saying “oh I’m not into politics” isn’t going to fly."

If these kids have access to the internet to engage in fan commjnities they're no more than a Google search away from knowing about how manipulated reality tv is. Just like wrestling being fake, reality tv being edited has filtered into the popular consciousness and has been around for at least a decade if not longer."
9341,2020-12-11 03:20:35,k9zdem,"Yup. Also, I dunno how the RPDR fandom being the same usual messy self is worthy more of a post than a literal sexual predator in the same fucking season. Brownie points for research, I guess."

9346,2020-12-09 22:01:26,k9zdem,"But pronouns are one thing, being referred to as a boy/man or a girl/woman seems different, no? I'm not nb myself so I'm just going off an impression here, but it seems like language that should be avoided."
9347,2020-12-10 18:05:28,k9zdem,Dude... you said in another comment that you are 19 lmao
9348,2020-12-10 21:39:26,k9zdem,"i'm not part of the community (LGBTQIA+) but i do have strained parental relationships (and am ""older"" according to your metrics i'm sure) and i thought it was really cool that she had a good relationship with her mom. in general i love love. it's always heartwarming to see people who love each other.

maybe not to you or others who get off their rocks off on bullying people, idk."
9349,2020-12-10 13:33:42,k9zdem,"Yes. It was very insensitive. Especially as other drag queens famous within the community were expressing horror at it, publicly posting numbers to call and petitions to sign, or getting involved in protests. 

Meanwhile, GiGi Goode just made an insensitive ass comment."
9350,2020-12-11 03:23:08,k9zdem,What harm?
9351,2020-12-10 14:46:24,k9zdem,"Hmm that's weird. Like I know there is that thing where a lot of characters that were red heads in originals are being re imagined as different races in remakes, but I assumed they were just going to give the actress who will be playing Ariel a red wig? It's not exactly a colour of hair that anyone naturally has, it's more fire truck red than ginger. Also black people can naturally be born with red hair anyway so it's a moot point"
9352,2020-12-11 03:24:16,k9zdem,Who isn't?
9353,2020-12-10 18:41:32,k9zdem,"It's so funny how people's perception about the same thing can be so different.
Yes, I've watched every single episode. But I don't follow any of the queen's on social media, maybe that's why you all think Jaida deserved it?! I don't know. I just don't see her as this great contestant.
I still think Crystal Methyd deserved the win."
9354,2020-12-12 20:16:36,k9zdem,Are we visiting the same subs?
9355,2020-12-10 04:15:33,k9zdem,This is incorrect!! How old are you?!
9356,2020-12-09 21:40:52,k9zdem,Yeah this post is a little out of touch with the fandom IMO It reeks of a lack of understanding of the absolute white exceptionalism Gigi has benefitted from.
9357,2020-12-09 21:41:10,k9zdem,"But I’ve never seen fans of a certain queen become so demonized, especially not when they’re LITERAL CHILDREN. 

Don’t get me wrong, the racism deserves a mega thread on here, and it’s a huge fucking problem, but I have never, in 3 years in this fandom, seen what was essentially a bunch of young girls with a crush on a cute, internet/niche famous guy be targeted, called stupid, crazy, and/or blind by a bunch of grown ass adults, to the point that they basically made their own fandom within a fanbase (the Haus of Avalon fans). 

What we did to GiGi fans was gross as shit, and for older Gen Z’ers like myself and many of the other people I think were also involved, just as bad as the “not like other girls” stigma around liking pop boy bands or popular artists in the early 20-teens."
9358,2020-12-26 20:21:46,k9zdem,its clear as day that he looks good in and out of drag and that fuels a LOT of jealousy
9359,2020-12-10 08:36:42,k9zdem,"I wanted to start watching RPDR, could you pls explain how is it incredibly racist?"
9360,2020-12-09 21:07:01,k9zdem,Someone NEEDS to do Moira Rose for Snatch Game
9361,2020-12-10 18:35:48,k9zdem,"Sure, but not wanting to watch the news doesn't somehow make you a brat or a bad person. Neither does being white or close with your parents."
9362,2020-12-10 15:47:08,k9zdem,"Yes I am queer, and yes, I can name someone like GiGi. Ask any of your queer friends who’ve been out long enough if they know a privileged queer person who doesn’t seem to care about the rest of the community and they’ll say yes. 

Of course, it’s ok for people to be privileged. Nothing wrong with that! What’s not ok is refusing to acknowledge that and then not even showing an interest in learning about issues that people who aren’t as privileged have in your community or in the world overall, as seen in “I can’t breathe”gate."
9363,2020-12-09 22:22:39,k9zdem,"Yeah, the way that the fandom usually talked about SP’s look every week as belonging to the designer was REALLY illuminating to me in a way I hadn’t really thought of before how much putting in a good run can hinge on what designer you can book and pay for. There are totally exceptions of course but it was a bucket of cold water week after week to give proper attribution to lewks that in another timeline I would have fully thought of as SP’s."
9364,2020-12-10 20:35:05,k9zdem,"I mean, she literally dressed up as Heather Chandler and Daphne from Scooby Doo for two of her runways, so like, go off cosplay queen, I guess?"
9365,2020-12-09 21:59:39,k9zdem,"See that's a totally legitimate criticism and I agree with it.  But it's a separate criticism, and I saw both at the time."
9366,2020-12-09 22:31:46,k9zdem,"THIS! These are the words I was looking for to help explain part of why GiGi rubbed so many older fans the wrong way, and part of why I think my mind jumped to compare her to straight people her age who found TikTok fame this summer.

There’s sort of an expectation that you’ll be a representative to a media unfamiliar with queer art that many older fans put on the winners’ shoulders. It’s why winners like Yvie and Sasha, while undeniably just as deserving winners as the others they share a title with, aren’t the most popular with older fans, but winners such as Bob and Aquaria, are. And although I agree the pressure is unfair at times (we’re not electing a member of the lgbt community to speak before congress, this is a drag show. They don’t need to be some kind of powerful public speaker), the winner still needs to be willing to engage in activism and at least pretend to show an interest in it, neither of which GiGi did.

Edit: also you’re right, Jaida didn’t have a tragic backstory."
9367,2020-12-10 00:08:32,k9zdem,if drag race is representing LGBT culture to the masses then my condolences
9368,2020-12-10 01:05:17,k9zdem,ty!! is there a way to make the hashtag show up otherwise?
9369,2020-12-10 04:23:05,k9zdem,"I feel like OP is probably really young and feels bad about getting sucked into bullying people online.

They keep saying “we” like the whole fandom was involved when really it was messy teens ganging up on other messy teens.


This barely registers as drama to those in the fandom who didn’t get involved in the shit slinging."
9370,2020-12-11 01:02:20,k9zdem,"Sorry, they sent their goons over here. Like full time sent their people on me. Thought you were one from what you said"

9373,2020-12-10 18:06:22,k9zdem,"It's not common. How can they know who won when they literally all filmed scenes ""winning"" and RP or the editors/producers can change it on a dime?"
9374,2020-12-10 06:59:52,k9zdem,"That's kinda what the fandom *is* these days. To be in it is to be *in* that mess. Think of it like American football, tbh, where everyone picks their team and shits on every other teom."
9375,2020-12-09 22:05:24,k9zdem,"Hrmm, I see. I'm not sure (also not non-binary). I was of the impression that they are sort of linked. Like if I feel most comfortable with she/her pronouns, I'm also most comfortable with girl/woman language, so Gigi stating any pronouns are fine implies they are okay being called a man or a woman, but I could very well be wrong about that! I'd love for someone more familiar with the situation to step in."
9376,2020-12-10 18:41:45,k9zdem,"“Older fan” when they also started watching during season 10 LOL

If you weren’t pirating links to watch it on Logo/at the bars on a weeknight bc it wasn’t in your cable package then I’m not buying it!"
9377,2020-12-12 22:42:06,k9zdem,"You know what, I think you're right. Bullying and hating on someone for having a good relationship with their family is bullshit. I get that GiGi could've been disagreeable in other manners ( I don't know, I don't watch this show), but this? This is the vilest, most jealous, gate-keeping reason to dislike someone. Fuck this noise."
9378,2020-12-10 14:54:52,k9zdem,"It was racism, and not just a privileged white influencer’s racist bitch fit, but a pattern as the same queen, Ariel Versace, [did a Princess Tiana makeup tutorial](https://youtu.be/7hosLm-gM2I) and has been accused of doing performances mocking 9/11, I believe? Here’s a [jakeyonce video from the time explaining it](https://youtu.be/CznKYsuyRzM) .

To put things into perspective, what she did was so infamous, even Jeffree Star, problematic king of the makeup world who’ll take any queen who’ll work with him publicly for a collab, won’t touch her."
9379,2020-12-10 18:43:58,k9zdem,I just don’t really buy into the whole idea of “most improved = winner”. I want the winner to radiate winner energy from the very beginning and I got that from Jaida as early as the queens ruveal
9380,2020-12-10 04:38:44,k9zdem,"I got straight up accused of ""pandering to black people"" or some such nonsense when I watched just the last home-filmed lip syncs and said I liked Jaida's more (and found Crystals more interesting albeit batshit lol) so like... The problems were not as one sided as this post makes it sound and I'm not even a drag race fan and I know that"
9381,2020-12-09 22:01:36,k9zdem,"Much as it's a dated reference, I do feel like going all ""you sweet summer child"" on you. You say you've been in the fandom for three years - well, early Drag Race was really something else. I mean even within the past three years we've seen Tyra Sanchez threatening to bomb DragCon. I'm not saying that bullying Gigi's fans was fine, but it's pretty low on the list of Drag Race drama."
9382,2020-12-10 10:37:06,k9zdem,"Adore fans were mostly kids, back when season 6 aired. She was massively popular on tumblr with teen girls. They got dunked on a lot"
9383,2020-12-26 22:37:38,k9zdem,"yeah nothing about them (they don't use he/him, weirdo) being racist, right? PoC and allies can't be mad at racism, obviously we're all just jealous /s

Your subtle racism is showing, btw."
9384,2020-12-10 09:21:32,k9zdem,"The fan community had a massive racism problem, and how they treat the “attractive” white queens versus the queens of color. This is in addition to winners doing blackface, lots of racial politics that would take a lot of time to get into, and it could be a massive write up all in its own.

9385,2020-12-10 15:36:27,k9zdem,"So basically, if you’re white and you get a villain edit, you can turn it into [a money making opportunity](https://www.instagram.com/p/CIl0pjtJMnb/?igshid=1sumb3a0v4d66) , as Alaska, shown here, did on her All Stars season (and won that season, mind you) after being one of the mean girls of season 5. 

If you’re a person of color and get a villain edit, you get [death threats](https://www.instagram.com/p/CFNsAaZjhpR/?igshid=1vkgmabnkt2g3) , as happened to the lovely Brita Filter recently. She ended up having to leave social media because of it, which is really sad, but has recently returned. 

That’s just a short and sweet summary for an unacquainted person on a SUPER COMPLEX problem in the fandom that I’d love to see someone who’s been around longer do a write up on here of. I’d do one myself, but I don’t feel that I know the complexities and the history of the racist corners of the fandom enough to fully do the serious issue justice."
9386,2020-12-09 21:31:21,k9zdem,IIRC there's a rule against using fictional characters in Snatch Game but one could do Catherine O'Hara and lean super hard on Moira-isms.
9387,2020-12-10 19:03:01,k9zdem,"It does make you unworthy of a position that would have many people looking to you in terms of activism.

To put it in perspective, let’s say a girl running for Miss America, Miss whatever state you hate the most, decided to publicly declare that she hated watching the news and it upset her terribly. People in the pageant world would be upset, as I believe it’s expected that those girls have a philanthropy. 

Except in this case, the current reigning is expected to be sort of a modern icon for the community. She’ll get more press interviews, larger gigs (in a normal year), and even HUGE opportunities compared to her season sisters, even the other finalists. 

For example, from the previous 3 before Jaida (since Jaida was unfortunately not able to take full advantage of the gigs), Sasha Velour was able to do a massive one woman tour, Aquaria walked at the Met gala, and Yvie Oddly got a whole exhibit of some of her artifacts from the show at the Denver museum. 

GiGi’s post show success in the mainstream that I detailed after her not winning is an exception, not the rule. 

Getting crowned gives you a huge platform, and if fans think you’ll misuse it, they’ll turn on you before it’s even on your head."
9388,2020-12-10 16:03:16,k9zdem,"As a trans queer person I promise I wasn't denying the existence of privileged queers, just saying that the way you're commenting is very bizarre. You're commenting like you're constantly updating a rulebook which makes you seem either very new or like an outsider looking in."
9389,2020-12-09 22:14:44,k9zdem,"I felt like the people criticising her having clothes designed by her mother weren’t actually mad that she gets along with her mother. They were bothered that someone who gets along with their parents and has had an “easy” upbringing was refusing to engage with the community in a meaningful way.


Like I’m personally really happy that she has supportive parents but it didn’t add anything to her drag as an art form. Her outfits didn’t scream “drag” they were kind of tame, and it felt like she was getting a pass because they were well made garments even if they weren’t very creative.


Like technical proficiency doesn’t mean your art is good if you get what I mean? I don’t think it was actual bitterness and hate for her upbringing, just that if you have the life where you can “not be interested in politics” you have to have something substantial to prove yourself with."
9390,2020-12-09 23:46:39,k9zdem,How on earth could people look at Sasha Velour and Yvie Oddly and be mad at not being good representatives of art? Like Sasha is probably the most knowledgeable about Queer History of any winner and art is her whole thing. Yvie has been spreading awareness of disability causes and been given flack for it. Like I love Bob (admittedly I don't like Aquarium) but if people are mad at Gigi for not being an activist then why do these folks come for Sasha and Yvie?
9391,2020-12-10 10:43:34,k9zdem,"I'm a Sasha fan and even i felt Shea deserved to win. It's not a dig against Sasha, and ""older fans"" mostly seem to have a similar stance where it's less ""Sasha deserved to lose"" and more ""Shea deserved to win"". It's really nothing personal"

I am 19, actually, as you may have guessed from the TikTok references, and I do feel guilty about being involved, even if it what happened to those kids is minor compared to what POC queens have gone through over the years, it was still wrong, and I felt it needed to be said, especially with Symone coming on this season and the fact that the kids will probably come back."

She also fetishizes black men, pushes queer women out of queer spaces (assuming they’re straight), and like a number of other things have popped up, but those are the big ones"
9397,2020-12-10 18:15:20,k9zdem,"I wasn't just talking about Drag Race, hence my use of a more general term. In lots of reality shows, like Survivor (for one example), the players play a role in determining the winner and the finale isn't until months after the show is wrapped, meaning there's plenty of time for the contestants to communicate about who won. It's a common thing in lots of shows."
9398,2020-12-10 08:00:18,k9zdem,"There's a difference between shitting on the team and shitting on people who like the team.

I completely reject that that's what the RPDR fandom is. I'm a fan and I don't bully people if they like people I don't like. That's so fucked up."
9399,2020-12-09 22:48:08,k9zdem,"Non-binary person weighing in here.

They are linked in societal standards. It is the norm in our society to think that men have he/him pronouns and women have she/her pronouns. However, like gender, this is a cultural construct and pronouns are not inherently gendered. I would always use ""person"" for someone who uses all pronouns unless they tell you otherwise.

Editing to elaborate. I use he/him and they/them but I prefer gender neutral terms. Just because I use he/him doesn't mean I always like masculine words for myself. Anyway, always stick with gender neutral if you aren't sure."
9400,2020-12-10 05:24:41,k9zdem,This post was written by a 17 year old who started watching the show in the last 3 years so their understanding of the intricacies of this fandom are surface level at best.
9401,2020-12-10 04:18:25,k9zdem,Yeah OP seems really new to the fandom. I’ve been watching since season 5 and this drama is barely a blip on the radar.
9402,2020-12-10 14:05:01,k9zdem,"I have to agree. And it's not being gatekeep-y at all. I would argue that it's an incorrect representation of what the fandom has been like for the past 10 years, especially to an audience that is completely unfamiliar with the show. It's one of the most vicious fandoms out there. I'm only a lurker for the most part, but it makes me sad that newer fans come and join only to take part in the bullying, just as OP has admitted in the post."
9403,2020-12-10 02:34:19,k9zdem,Is 3 years ago still post-Broosh/Brandgate? My sense of time in the fandom is wonky at this point.
9404,2020-12-09 23:48:19,k9zdem,Hahaha three years is nothing and absolutely when the show started to reach peak sanitization.
9405,2020-12-10 08:55:07,k9zdem,I am not in the RPDR fandom but didn't Valentina have a fandom that also caused some insanity? At least they had to make an episode about it and her calling her fans off...?
9406,2020-12-09 22:06:10,k9zdem,"Oh god, yeah. The bombing threat was FUCKING TERRIFYING as a new fan. I just don’t want this fandom to add other negative trait to our resume."

9412,2020-12-11 03:11:27,k9zdem,You can choose a philanthropy without being an avid (or even occasional) news-watcher.  The only difference is that it probably won't be one directly involved with the important issues of the day™ (as if the other problems in the world suddenly stopped needing the philanthropy).
9413,2020-12-13 20:55:55,k9zdem,Sounds like a straight woman or a little gay posting this tbh. Also this whole post is a mess.

9415,2020-12-09 22:37:00,k9zdem,"God damn, you shouldve written my post for me! 

Especially when GiGi made the “queer privilege” comment, it really cut a lot of fans deeply. In interviews pre season, she’d talked at length about her mom sewing her clothes, and even won the ball challenge wearing at least one outfit (I don’t remember where the Heathers look came from, but I know her mom made the Basketball wife look) made by her mom. 

People really saw that as not being considerate to a community that largely has issues with unsupportive parents and abuse happening to young members, like conversion therapy, at best, and at worst, her being a spoiled, ungrateful brat who didn’t deserve a loving mother or a platform to showcase her incredible talent. And that’s 100% a valid criticism she’s never really taken, and I think she should re apologize for the queer privilege comment, addressing that that is why it upset so many people, even if her young fans weren’t the ones hurt by it."
9416,2020-12-09 23:55:25,k9zdem,"They’re not “activisty enough” in the traditional way, so they get flack, even though they do continue the legacy of activism, Sasha in her fashion, and Yvie through, most recently, her music. 

But it’s not a cute social media post they can like and share, it requires using your brain, so it “doesn’t count”."
9417,2020-12-10 03:34:52,k9zdem,Ew. Thank you for elaborating.
9418,2020-12-10 18:28:08,k9zdem,"Right, but in this post, comment thread and the section you quoted being all 'is whoosh yay or nay???' we *are* talking specifically about drag race."
9419,2020-12-10 08:14:25,k9zdem,"Can't stop you from rejecting that part of the fandom, but it doesn't change that it's a very well-known, very active, and highly-encompassing part of it.

Fight against it. That would be more helpful than turning a blind eye, or saying you don't personally take part in it - neither of which stops it from happening."
9420,2020-12-09 23:17:19,k9zdem,"Thank you so much for your perspective! Like a lot of things, it's just not something I'd really considered (or had to consider) before. I appreciate the information, I will do my best to separate those ideas in my head going forward!

I have made an attempt in my own language to use they/them when I am unsure, but it's good to know that I should also default to ""person"" instead of man or woman as well, even when I know what pronouns to use. Thanks for being understanding of my ignorance!"

9425,2020-12-10 04:14:17,k9zdem,"It was right around then, and then WoW/straight white women took over the subreddit."
9426,2020-12-10 13:12:45,k9zdem,"Oh Jesus, that was right before I started watching. People, like, BULLIED the girl who got her eliminated, Valentina claimed at the reunion to have not seen anything happen, and then the queen who got bullied and two of the other queens were like, bitch you spent press week on your phone tho..."
9427,2020-12-10 09:26:15,k9zdem,"It’s no problem! For extra credit start looking up Sharon Needles and the lengths the fandom goes to to make excuses for her constant racism, transphobia, etc."
9428,2021-05-24 12:05:36,k9zdem,Brita literally got death threats and nearly had a suicide attempt over it...
9429,2020-12-09 21:59:35,k9zdem,How did I not think of this.
9430,2020-12-13 22:08:26,k9zdem,always wary of cis women obsessed with RuPaul tbh
9431,2020-12-09 23:20:14,k9zdem,"I don’t think she should have to apologise again, I’m sure she learned her lesson and there’s no need for this to be rehashed unless she says something else ignorant that shows she hasn’t gained any sensitivity.

The truth is some people aren’t cut out to be leaders. People at the time compared her to aquaria but aquaria has shown time and time again that she has a big heart and wants to have a positive impact with her role as winner.


That’s where Gigi failed. She didn’t ever really care, she just wanted to dress up and be pretty, and while she’s good at that there’s nothing novel about what she presented. There’s no need to award that with the position of “drag superstar” because there was nothing “super” about it.


I don’t bemoan her a position on the show, I just don’t think she’s anywhere near the league of the winners of past seasons and it’s right that she didn’t win."
9432,2020-12-10 01:09:41,k9zdem,"I remember when people were mad at Yvie for not wanting to take pictures with random fans outside of lines because she didn't have the energy to be ""on"" 24/7. She used a very common metaphor in the disabled community ""I don't have the spoons"" and people dragged her for it. It was a really ugly bit of ableist behavior from the fans who really just saw the performers as photo op moments and not people. Ive noticed Yvies spoken up about rare diseases and visibility too and for some reason that never gets the attention that a new fashion look does. Yvies my favorite winner with Sasha and Jinkx so maybe I'm biased but I feel like the fandom doesn't want to hear from people who don't fit the mold of pretty fashion queen."
9433,2020-12-11 09:12:33,k9zdem,"oml did you fact check? or just trust the opinion of a random on reddit

as someone who follows cracker, a lot of this stuff is here-say or overblown, if you weren't aware of this stuff before u/shaddeline brought it up to you i'd recommend going and forming your own opinion instead of jumping onto the hate-train"
9434,2020-12-10 19:39:58,k9zdem,"I mean, the OP's text that I quoted says ""reality show contestants,"" not ""Drag Race contestants."" That's pretty clearly not specifically referring to only Drag Race, in my estimation."
9435,2020-12-10 08:43:15,k9zdem,Uhhh okay. I could fight against it or just keep doing me and not being toxic. I pick the latter.
9436,2020-12-09 23:25:34,k9zdem,Of course. Have a nice day!
9437,2020-12-10 10:49:13,k9zdem,"The word 'folk' does a lot of good in English as well for this because it's old fashioned.

Like 'hi folks' instead of 'hi guys'."
9438,2020-12-10 16:18:00,k9zdem,They sully nolimbs iconic legacy with their username and they should be removed legally
9439,2020-12-11 02:59:10,k9zdem,"One of the judges of Drag Race Canada, Jeffrey Bowyer Chapman, was harassed off of social media because he was perceived as being too mean. The level and the vitriol of the hate and threats he received were appalling and in the Twitter pile-ons he faced it was clear that a lot of the accounts weren’t even particularly Drag Race fans, they were just racist and homophobic opportunists trawling social media for an excuse to ruin a successful gay black man’s day/life. To be clear, that doesn’t absolve the fandom, which has corners that are vile enough even before they’re getting gassed up and egged on by shit stirring, abusive anonymous accounts. 

I recently re-watched DRC and JBC really didn’t do anything to warrant a fraction of the shit he got. All of the judging panel were finding their feet, he’d clearly been briefed to be the “meaner” judge, but compared to US judges like Santino Rice, Michelle Visage on a bad day or even Ru when he’s had to dish out tough love, JBC really wasn’t THAT bad. When you look at other competitive reality shows, Simon Cowell has said more brutally cruel things to contestants in a single American Idol critique than Jeffrey cumulatively said in the entire season of Drag Race Canada. His drag knowledge was a little patchy, his tone was a bit bitchy and his eye makeup was crunchy. That’s the extent of his crimes. None of that justified him being sent images of burning crosses or flooding his DMs with the n word.

It’s not unique to drag race fandom, it’s a depressingly familiar pattern that plays out in every fandom or community. People find trivial excuses to indulge in unbridled bigotry, smear performers of color as “aggressive” or any number of racist dogwhistle terms, maintain a veneer of plausible deniability (of course I’m not saying it because he’s black, he’s just a shitty mean judge who should be fired for attacking my white faves!). Harass the cast until they delete social media, rinse, repeat. Somehow it just so happens to be the cast members of color who get the worst of it, every season. Yet still the fandom pretends not to recognise the pattern. 

But now I’m the one writing essays on a post that’s had more than enough of that already, I just wanted to provide another recent, thorough and unambiguous example of where fandom racism always leads."
9440,2020-12-10 10:13:47,k9zdem,"[Yes](https://reddit.com/r/rupaulsdragrace/comments/ijb037/send_widow_some_love/), Widow faced a lot of bullying and racist harassment, she was lovely and showed how talented she was, she didn’t even have a “villain edit” or any major fuck ups. She was fat, Black, as well as immensely talented and confident, and a lot of the drag race fandom can’t handle that. 



[Brita](https://reddit.com/r/rupaulsdragrace/comments/g4l9h8/brita_deleting_social_media_indefinitely_after/) was another s12 queen who was mercilessly bullied and
 [sent A LOT of death threats](https://reddit.com/r/rupaulsdragrace/comments/iu6rjl/a_birthday_update_from_brita_3/), 
she tried to [seriously hurt herself](https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/10/22/brita-filter-drag-race-bullying-overdose-racist-toxic/) because of it. This article also includes a part about other QoC who were racially abused during and after their runs on the show. 


Every season, QoC (& fat queens, even more for fat QoC) face disproportionate and horrific levels of hate and harassment, regardless of their edit, talents, and personality. 


But obviously GiGi was the main victim of s12 🙄 OP just wanted to reminisce on all the bullying they did (seriously it’s like they’re gloating every time they say “WE bullied these children/queens”) whilst trying to take the moral high ground when they’ve been part of the toxic bullying group every season they’ve watched. And they’ll do it again s13 and afterwards say “oh no how is this fandom so cruel?? We need to do better!”

Like: [“the racism is a huge fucking problem BUT let’s focus on the white children!”](https://i.imgur.com/XuGPQ3A.jpg); 
an entire comment about the racial dimension of RPDR bullying and how OP underplayed Jeffree’s racism and OP ignores it all to [criticise Gigi’s queer- not white- privilege](https://i.imgur.com/7h7ScqV.jpg); 
again, self-confessed bully [OP bends over backwards to be polite about a known racist](https://i.imgur.com/Q0miHXm.jpg); 
OP also [bullied Silky, a s11 queen](https://i.imgur.com/X7i75Ob.jpg)

In case you’re wondering why OP didn’t make a post about the racism within the fandom... OP is definitely a part of it. Even shit like [this](https://i.imgur.com/WioRDFJ.jpg)- no bitch, Jaida was loved from episode 1 because she made a great verse, delivered it amazingly, she gave an incredible lipsync, and her fashion and makeup was amazing. Why dismiss all her talents and attribute her popularity to another queen’s status? She was definitely more popular because she went against Sherry but she more than proved herself independently of that."
9441,2020-12-12 20:16:36,k9zdem,"Right. People going a little overboard on an apolitical white twink right in the middle of a BLM upheaval and an election year does not deserve this multi-page write up. This wasn’t even the worst thing from this season!

 It was more for OP to clear their conscience bc they were a perpetrator than anything else."
9442,2020-12-09 22:37:58,k9zdem,"Queens have done it before!  Think Ben Delacreme as the Dowager Countess from Downton Abbey but with ""Maggie Smith"" on the name card."
9443,2020-12-14 07:29:39,k9zdem,💯
9444,2020-12-10 18:30:21,k9zdem,"As someone with a chronic illness I agree, but then again most lgbtq spaces are ableist, so what do you expect really?"
9445,2020-12-10 01:15:56,k9zdem,"Oh, that was AWFUL. It broke my heart as an Yvie fan."
9446,2020-12-11 09:56:56,k9zdem,[deleted]
9447,2020-12-11 16:13:43,k9zdem,Don't come for me for saying thank you
9448,2020-12-10 19:42:11,k9zdem,Ok fine
9449,2020-12-10 08:49:29,k9zdem,"That's fine. Just be aware that everything else you said is virtue signalling, since - again - it doesn't do anything to change reality. 🤷🏽‍♀️"
9450,2020-12-10 16:26:32,k9zdem,"Despite not being a big rpdr fan I love what no limbs is doing so I sent them a pic of myself wearing their merch outside of the Mutter Museum--for reference, a museum full of pickled body parts and preserved fetal specimens put up for public view in the name of furthering information about medical history. I referred to it as the ""basement hall of fame."" They replied by saying ""spray tan my fetus."" 

Iconic."
9451,2020-12-10 19:22:09,k9zdem,"Damn, thank you for the detailed follow up, this is brilliant!

Also you've very nicely articulated the aspects of this OP I found uncomfortable, thank you - at first I was really responsive to the ""we as a fandom need to do better re: bullying"" line, which is true, but then the silky comment kind of undermined it. Plus I was super uncomfortable with ""beating sherry pie"" being cited as the reason for Jaida's popularity - I loved Jaida because her humour was clever, her looks were great, she seemed like a nice person, and it was also super lovely seeing a black pageant queen get some f*cking recognition after 12 seasons of that style of drag being overlooked?"
9452,2020-12-12 20:14:49,k9zdem,"> Every season, QoC (& fat queens, even more for fat QoC)

You can just say Silky."
9453,2020-12-11 03:24:09,k9zdem,"Late to the party but THIS, right here, is the tea."
9454,2020-12-12 20:22:51,k9zdem,"Yeah. Gigi did this to herself, mostly, and overall she shot her own feet by being completely insensitive to everything she shouldn't have been, and some fans jumped too quick to her throat, they have jumped much harder to less deserving throats and we all know it. Silky, Asia, NBB, and if someone wants to acuse me of making this about race, even fucking Farrah Moan had Valentina's fans ganging up on her."
9455,2020-12-10 02:41:41,k9zdem,Also Bob doing Crazy Eyes and putting Uzo Aduba on the card.
9456,2021-05-10 11:05:04,k9zdem,Also everyone that has done Eartha Kitt basically doing Catwoman lmao. You could believe that was her only role
9457,2020-12-10 21:29:06,k9zdem,It's really disappointing the amount of supposedly accepting and progressive spaces are still quite ableist.
9458,2020-12-11 10:13:17,k9zdem,"are you talking about [this article](https://slate.com/human-interest/2014/02/homophobia-in-west-africa-a-drag-queen-explores-the-anti-gay-reputation.html)? ""racist fetishizing trash"" is quite the statement from someone that I'm assuming didn't risk their life at least twice to learn about what being gay and black is like in Senegal where 99% of people in the first world wouldn't, it seems she's much more engaged with issues of race than most are and certainly I am. she went to senegal, met a dude she liked, and started a relationship with him. wtf how does that make her a racist

it seems that she has a thing for black dudes - does this mean that she's ""fetishizing"" them though? considering she pursued a trans-atlantic relationship with a black dude, it seems that she was pretty serious about him and wasn't unfair to him, so idk where the objectification or dehumanisation is coming in that would imply that she's treating black men as nothing more than sexual objects."
9459,2020-12-11 22:35:47,k9zdem,"lol i'm not coming for you, I asked you a question then gave rationale for that question. honestly, so many of the rumours floating around the fandom (fracking, the sharon situation, cracker, silky's accusations etc.) turn out to be a very different story when you actually look for facts and sources instead of listening to reddit randoms."
9460,2020-12-10 08:58:50,k9zdem,Okay thank you girl
9461,2020-12-10 06:46:37,k9zdem,And don't forget Stacy Layne Matthews aka Henny as Precious's Mom...I mean as Mo'nique!
9462,2020-12-11 18:46:25,k9zdem,"It’s objectively impossible to find a big progressive space that isn’t misogynistic, transphobic, homophobic, racist, OR ableist"
9463,2020-12-10 16:45:54,k9zdem,"You know what? I reread this. It's not fair of me to be like, ""Fight back on it if you don't like it,"" when the post I was replying to literally had you calling that bullying out. My bad."
9464,2020-12-10 17:55:26,k9zdem,"Well thanks for the follow up and the apology, but no worries, I didn't take it personally 😇"

9510,2020-12-09 03:52:30,k9jge4,Imagine owning a ~~successful~~ [rapidly declining](https://www.insider.com/jeffree-star-makeup-tj-maxx-video-views-blood-money-2020-11) makeup brand
9511,2020-12-09 03:20:00,k9jge4,"I think it's less about money and more about attention. He can't bear the thought that people might move on from him so he has to constantly up the ante.

I've been aware of him since his MySpace music days and he's always been like this."
9512,2020-12-09 05:59:38,k9jge4,Wut? Dammit still take my upvote! 👍🏻
9513,2020-12-10 17:10:50,k9jge4,This is why aliens won't talk to us.
9514,2020-12-09 10:16:07,k9jge4,Or maybe he wants to branch in the adult toys industry and use the video as a commercial for nipples covers and toys covered in his fugly imprint ?
9515,2020-12-09 10:22:28,k9jge4,He needs the attention.
9516,2020-12-09 11:49:46,k9jge4,"Yea it's not about the money. This man has been in real estate since he was 18, he's nothing but poor. He just craves attention so much"
9517,2020-12-09 09:12:10,k9jge4,I second this: 🤮
9518,2020-12-09 04:21:11,k9jge4,I can imagine it getting leaked in a minute and him just going insane
9519,2020-12-09 12:37:40,k9jge4,You know when you’re nauseated and know you would feel better if you could just puke but don’t want to force yourself? Porn with him in it will make you vomit naturally.
9520,2020-12-09 10:22:09,k9jge4,Attention.
9521,2020-12-09 17:46:32,k9jge4,"People want to hear about J*; this post would not be upvoted if not. He is a fixture in the beauty community even if you personally do not care. There is a Jeffree content flair that you have the option of filtering out if you are not interested. You can also just downvote.

I personally don’t like discussing Smokey Glow as I don’t find her interesting so I just ignore posts about her content."
9522,2020-12-09 04:26:35,k9jge4,Kat is out to get him and I'm here for it
9523,2020-12-09 03:34:37,k9jge4,Oh definitely !
9524,2020-12-09 06:00:31,k9jge4,I think he’s all about money AND attention! Solid point!
9525,2020-12-09 16:45:17,k9jge4,Lol thank you kindly
9526,2020-12-11 05:16:10,k9jge4,This is exactly why!!
9527,2020-12-09 12:58:07,k9jge4,That would make a lot of sense tbh.  But I wonder how much of his older fanbase stuck around?  If he's just left with a majority young audience then that stuff isn't going to sell very well.
9528,2020-12-09 11:00:33,k9jge4,🤣🤣🤣 I can see him doing this
9529,2020-12-09 09:15:26,k9jge4,I third this: 🤮
9530,2020-12-09 04:46:28,k9jge4,I pictured this realistically in my head and i can't stop laughing
9531,2020-12-09 10:13:57,k9jge4,"you mean ""getting leaked"" like Morphe palettes got leaked or ""getting leaked""-getting leaked?"
9532,2020-12-09 18:02:58,k9jge4,"...

The difference here is one is a garbage person whose shitty behavior you're enabling by constantly posting about him. Don't be fucking obtuse, that's a ridiculous comparison."
9533,2020-12-09 05:37:06,k9jge4,Great minds think alike! /s
9534,2020-12-09 13:25:50,k9jge4,🤢🤮
9535,2020-12-09 12:01:13,k9jge4,"ah yes “getting leaked” 

I think it would be funny but ultimately him getting any attention is undeserved"
9536,2020-12-09 18:04:33,k9jge4,"I’m not comparing the two as people. I’m saying ignore content you don’t want to see. This community was founded in part because of the oppressive moderation in the old sub. If people want to discuss something and they are not breaking any rules, it stays. Also, “enabling” is a reach."
9537,2020-12-09 18:17:01,k9jge4,"Ahhh yes, the famously anti JStar BGC with 18 fucking mega threads on Bye Sister looool 


It's not about content I'm not interested in. And no, enabling is absolutely not a reach. You can stick your head in the sand all you want but you're giving him a platform and keeping him relevant. It doesn't matter how defensive you get, it doesn't change the outcome. All he cares about is attention, and you're giving it to him. That's on you."
9538,2020-12-09 18:20:39,k9jge4,"Alright. Anyway, the moratorium is not happening anytime soon without user approval from a majority of users in the sub so feel free to downvote and move on. Please utilize the filters to remove any J* content you do not want to see. If you want to see a moratorium, I encourage you to post in the pinned thread so that the mods can see if that’s something the community would want."

9551,2020-12-08 15:05:56,k958iv,Every time I hear about him it’s worse and worse.
9552,2020-12-08 16:15:24,k958iv,Same. Every time I’ve heard about him over the last year or so it’s nothing but bad news. Why is he so popular? Makeup/drag? Seems like all this bad press would just make him fade away but he’s like a cockroach.
9553,2020-12-08 20:07:40,k958iv,"He's pulled into the image is being hated and outcast, people seem to like that he does that. His makeup line is also great quality which some people care about more than the bad he's done. I'd like to point to Lime Crime whose owner is a nazi (there's photos of her in uniform but it was totally just for Halloween) but they have great formulas so people still buy from them."
9554,2020-12-08 03:39:01,k8wg4i,"I’m sorry I’m so fired up about this... I’m sick of people treating her like a fragile innocent doll who just doesn’t know any better! No, Eugenia! Your mental illness does not excuse you from supporting criminal behavior. Stop looking the other way! You have impressionable young followers who (for some reason) look up to you. Yet you’ve allowed this kind of nonsense onto your platform. You’re a 26 year old grown ass woman who refuses to  look outside of your delusional bubble to consider, that hey! Maybe the people I’ve been supporting, along with the dirtbags on my twitch and discord just might not be the most upstanding individuals!  🤷🏼‍♀️ 
I will try and say this as nicely as possible: Eugenia, wake TF up and get your head out of your ass!!

*steps down off soapbox*
I apologize for the long winded rant... Carry on..."
9555,2020-12-08 04:35:57,k8wg4i,"There could be a video of J* assaulting someone and Eugenia would still support him. Oh wait, there is a video. And she does support him."
9556,2020-12-08 05:12:37,k8wg4i,"At what point do we connect her supporting not just one or two, but *several* widely controversial people and businesses to her just overall being kind of a bigot in her own respect? Think of some of her past connections:

*Jeffree Star
*Shane Dawson
*Social Repose
*Gabbie Hanna
*Kati Morton
*Oscar Wylde 
*Her very own King Mod
*DFizzy
*Dolls Kill
*BetterHelp
*Her mother (of course) 

Like...you can have a severe eating disorder and still keep good company, right? But I think Eugenia might see some kind of kinship with people who endure a lot of online hate in general, no matter what the reason. Excusing what she’s excused in the past from these people tells me she’s actually not all that different from them."
9557,2020-12-08 03:54:51,k8wg4i,This is crazy! Reading it now. More evidence that villan can't deny. Good riddance.
9558,2020-12-08 04:50:26,k8wg4i,"The more I thought about her responding with her usual “That’s the thing guyzz! Jeffree is like the kindest and sweetest person and everything! 😅💕✨💫” the more pissed off I got. I doubt she’ll even be bothered to respond about this, because she’s too wrapped up in herself. Hence why it took her 8368375 weeks to get rid of her discord. And that was only because people were in her ear non-stop.
The level of cognitive and emotional detachment she displays never ceases to amaze me; especially in situations like this. And it just goes to show how badly she needs to leave the internet."
9559,2020-12-08 05:43:23,k8wg4i,Eugenia’s taste in friends is appalling. SMH 🤦‍♀️
9560,2020-12-08 21:46:16,k8wg4i,"Trash with cash, as I always say... ;)"
9561,2020-12-08 08:21:08,k8wg4i,"Called it in an earlier post lol. Adds up to about $70k all together. There’s the initial $25 thousand, then another $25 thousand if Business insider didn’t run an article, and another $20 thousand if contact with 2 others stopped."
9562,2020-12-11 00:24:55,k8wg4i,It makes me mad that she’ll support people like this and not her past friends who got her into care to help her
9563,2020-12-08 11:03:33,k8wg4i,"This is one thing I don’t get about Eugenia after JS has been exposed by so many people for his disgusting behavior she still buys his products which in turn shows her ongoing support for him. I would understand if Eugenia still used JS she already owned as she has put money into them previously but to buy new ones.

I don’t agree with this as you state she is inherently then supporting ""**disgusting pr\*datory behavior** """
9564,2020-12-09 11:11:02,k8wg4i,"Why are we censoring ""pr*datory""?"
9565,2020-12-10 02:39:39,k8wg4i,"So J* worshippers how are ya?

 Brief ETA to new apology and denial and new makeup video."
9566,2020-12-08 04:13:09,k8wg4i,All of this! She is an adult not a child. Granted she has a mental illness it still does not excuse her from her actions. A mentally ill person murders someone they still get punished for what they did and have to spend the rest of their life in a mental health facility. Why can't she be held accountable like the mentally ill person?
9567,2020-12-10 02:42:06,k8wg4i,"Lions allow me to have a fatherly guidance moment with you.
Never apologize for truth. Never."
9568,2020-12-08 14:43:26,k8wg4i,Sauce?
9569,2020-12-08 06:08:28,k8wg4i,"I think she clings to them because of this 'us against the world' mentality she has built up in her mind. She can hide behind the, ""everyone just hates me for no reason"" when she sees these people doing the same."
9570,2020-12-08 05:29:15,k8wg4i,"1000%!! Yet it’s so obvious that if she was ever called out/asked about this pattern of behavior, she’d try and chalk it up to being coincidental in some way, while still maintaining the “Oh nooo!!! I would never support pr*datory behavior! That’s horrible!” 
Part of me speculates that... given her history of supporting people that are “nice” to her, it’s obvious just how badly she lacks a solid emotional support system. 

But at the same time, come on dude! Jeffree Star, as “nice” as he is for giving you makeup and being friends with Shane, has clearly done some fucked up shit.. which has been spelled out black and white! I wish someone could get through to her that being “nice” does not define how good a friend somebody is! 🤦🏼‍♀️"
9571,2020-12-08 16:49:42,k8wg4i,"That’s what I mean. I think she is aware of the awful things people do but doesn’t mind them. They’d have to do something personally awful to *her* like threatening her ED in any way. As long as that’s off limits, you’re a good person in her eyes."

9576,2020-12-08 12:35:08,k8uq82,"While it looks horrible, it is also pretty standard.

45k is far less than what J* would spend in a trial, and it amazes me that is such a low figure (normally, they end this stuff by paying over 100k, wich would still be less than what they spend in a trial).

So it is just standard stuff."

9578,2020-12-10 02:43:15,k8uq82,Does anyone have a link to the videos that show Jeffree Star grabbing someone's genitalia at Warped Tour and the video of the intoxicated man leaving J* residence?

9583,2020-12-08 03:50:40,k8uq82,"Imagine excusing and protecting this... I agree it's ""innocent until proven guilty"" but these are literal allegations of several crimes. So it is a big deal and people need to question who they ""stan"""
9584,2020-12-08 16:30:51,k8uq82,"I think Jeffree Star and his minions don't mind feeding on his ""alleged"" victims and accusers naivete and likely being in financial need to offer and payout a low figure. They really cut themselves short with that figure."
9585,2020-12-08 12:36:32,k8uq82,"Yea I agree with you. As much as it's ""standard"" though it's still disturbing. Imagine being such a bad person you pay others to be silenced... *Can't relate*"

9598,2020-12-08 00:11:47,k8sowm,"If you want to go 15$ above your 50$ price limit, natasha Denona has an eyeshadow palette called sunrise that has golds, pinks and oranges. I know colourpop also has a few palettes with those colors in them if you want to also get the blues. What is fun about colourpop is that their round eyeshadow colours can be removed from the palette and put into other of their palettes. So she can essentially rearrange the colours to make a colour scheme that she likes"

9609,2020-12-07 17:48:24,k8elah,This seems like.......maybe not a great solution if everyone on this thread is mad about it. Just a thought.
9610,2020-12-07 17:02:05,k8elah,This may have gone over better if the examples of people we could talk about weren't the exact people were trying to avoid 😬
9611,2020-12-07 18:14:11,k8elah,The results to the March poll were never posted as far as I can tell. I can’t find it!

9618,2020-12-30 20:20:28,kn25su,"Im stoked af to learn she has a subreddit. Adore this woman, she inspired me to get sober."
9619,2020-12-30 19:09:49,kn25su,I’m only 15 mins in and it’s perfection so far. Never heard of her before. But she may have a new fan here.
9620,2020-12-30 13:22:22,kn25su,"Well guys, we got our entire review of ""The Beautiful World of Jeffree Star"" by Alizee. I saw tonnes of requests in her comments for it after the last video was posted on the sub. I can't wait to hear her roast the entire thing after having a few drinks. She's hilarious."
9621,2020-12-30 22:04:40,kn25su,"I've started to watch it (and I think I'll do it increments rather than the entire thing one time) and I've watched out the commentary about the first docuseries and I gotta say she is hilarious and spot on at times. I love how she calls out the truth of shane simply manipulating his audience inorder to appear relatable.

Like how Shane repeatedly says that he is poor and goes on to be like oh I'm just poor compared to jeffree. And like it's a theme throughout his series and videos of late. Like I'm poor. In the same breath shane will go on about how the money is never what he is about like with the palette. 

Like c'mon... the first things that always pop into your mind is wealth. Then who are you fooling (maybe the stans) cus it's obvious that you do care about money to the point where it's usually one of the first characteristics you observe about someone. 

And that's not even getting into the mansion (not house eh) that he lived in during the docuseries... and ofc the new one he has moved into. That pOoR house had a pool and a big garden and extra space for a gym and was big enough that you could use a golf cart. But oh that's just a poor man's hut... cus shane is so poor. I'm sorry I just realised after watching her video how annoying that rhetoric is."
9622,2020-12-30 20:10:48,kn25su,"I literally just finished watching this, the DEDICATION"
9623,2020-12-30 23:25:15,kn25su,I’ve seen her thumbnails but never clicked. I will check this out tonight 🙂
9624,2020-12-30 22:34:59,kn25su,i watched it this morning as i cleaned. alizee is doing god's work
9625,2020-12-30 22:58:48,kn25su,"I love her dry humor. I hope that she continues to make more commentary videos on his other ""docuseries""."
9626,2020-12-31 05:42:05,kn25su,Alizee is a-mazing
9627,2021-01-01 04:22:34,kn25su,NOOOO it's private now T\_T
9628,2020-12-31 20:19:51,kn25su,"Wow, the video is already unlisted! I wonder if Joffrey or Shane had anything to do with that? The link I posted still works, but it's clearly marked as ""unlisted"" underneath the player. I'm so annoyed, Alizee put so much work into this."
9629,2020-12-31 05:23:14,kn25su,"bruuuuh i never actually watched this docuseries but I am CACKLING

Before she even said it I 100% thought that the filming of Jeffree mixing palettes like he was out here hacking the FBI was THE most hilarious shit I've ever seen

Please tell me even fans back then thought that was ridiciulous 😭😭😭"
9630,2020-12-31 07:35:04,kn25su,She’s is so witty and clever that one. Love her commentary and reactions!
9631,2021-01-02 05:08:11,kn25su,It's private and I never got to watch it 😭😭😭

Congratulations on your sobriety by the way - Almost 2.5 years since I kicked my booze reliance and I know how bloody tough it can be."

9638,2021-01-04 15:43:29,kn25su,She doesn't drink?
9639,2020-12-31 03:53:08,kn25su,"I never get this behavior either. You'd think because Shane grew up poor, or at least lower middle class, he'd be a bit more humble? Like.. he KNOWS what its like to be ""actually"" poor, yet still has the audacity to say that shit, even if he is just exaggerating or putting on a show to play up Jeffree 🙄"
9640,2020-12-31 22:58:16,kn25su,A real editor wouldn’t have shown him traversing his property in a golf cart in the same videos as him pretending to be poor.
9641,2020-12-31 02:22:57,kn25su,You won't be disappointed! Alizee is amazing
9642,2021-01-01 10:21:03,kn25su,"Noo, I was only halfway through"

9644,2021-01-04 18:03:40,kn25su,It’s back up now 😄
9645,2020-12-31 00:42:27,kn25su,"She is sober, she had/has a cocaine addition iirc. She doesn’t talk about it all the time but she has a few videos dedicated to it and brings it up somewhat often when talking about other topics."
9646,2020-12-30 22:11:11,kn25su,I just watched her try not to laugh at his tictoks lol
9647,2021-01-01 15:48:03,kn25su,I was also only about half way through :(
9648,2021-01-14 11:24:55,kn25su,Private again
9649,2020-12-31 02:24:48,kn25su,Amazing. I always end up feeling such a strong kinship with YouTube people that have gone through sobriety.
9650,2020-12-30 16:24:47,kmy3l4,"This would be a really great point if Jeffrey, James, and Nikita weren’t already too big to just go away slowly. At this point they’re all rich enough and famous enough to be in the public eye for a long time (if you’re in the beauty space online at least) whether additional traffic is driven to their social media accounts or not."
9651,2020-12-30 17:03:37,kmy3l4,I think  you're confusing this sub with the circle jerk version.
9652,2020-12-30 15:01:58,kmy3l4,"When public figures act in a way that is actively harmful or promotes harmful behavior, they’re gonna get called out no matter how much it might bring them attention. I don’t care about their fans or if it makes them money. Not all of us live in a world where toxic behavior can just be ignored just because it’s inconvenient to bring it up. And these aren’t even just “fuck ups”. Some of these influencers have been blatantly racist or deliberately gone after other people. Ignoring that is just excusing it. 

What a bad take."
9653,2020-12-30 14:45:38,kmy3l4,"Simply ignoring people once they’ve gotten big doesn’t work in the real world. 

Talking here doesn’t get them any more money either. It does though inform others who don’t know stuff which is always good. People making fully informed decisions is never a bad thing. How do you think so many know how bad Jeff really is? From his comment section? No. From places like this. That’s how. Comment sections are echo chambers mostly and under control of that influencer. No real news and information happens there mostly. 

And going off your comments on this post you have no ground to call anyone else insecure. Yikes on all the bikes."
9654,2020-12-30 14:17:19,kmy3l4,"Thanks for the TED Talk, I do enjoy a nice big dose of condescension on a Wednesday afternoon."
9655,2020-12-30 18:28:47,kmy3l4,"This is stupid. R kelly would still be a free pedophile of people just ignored him. Outcry in Twitter literally is what led to wider stories victims feeling comfortable, a documentary, and finally some fucking justice. If you ignore them then brands will keep giving them money and they'll keep being a shitty person, just this time no one will be there to call them out."
9656,2020-12-30 19:06:45,kmy3l4,"I don't believe you're wrong, but you're likely preaching to the wrong crowd. You're primarily complaining about people calling out a problematic influencer on social media on a subreddit. Yes, some people on here do likely do it, but I doubt the majority do. We already know ""There is no such thing as bad press."" so we do choose to ignore them to not give them more publicity and ad revenue.

Sadly, I just don't think your ""solution"" to the problem is realistic. There are enough people out there of a certain group to be able to financially support influencers with different morals/beliefs. It's kind of like people that say to boycott Nestle or Walmart because of their horrible practices; sure, you can choose to personally do it because it makes you feel better, but they are a huge company that clearly hasn't been affected and will remain to operate."
9657,2020-12-30 15:08:31,kmy3l4,On the other hand I think these people have your fans who might not know about the things their fav has done. Some are open to learning more
9658,2020-12-30 22:46:39,kmy3l4,"i can agree with this. if i’m over someone, i unfollow them on youtube, IG, etc. I don’t find the need to hate them so much and watch their videos, every IG post/story, tweet to further spew hate. it’s dumb. just unfollow and move on. i know a lot of them have done and said damaging things. if needed, leave your one comment to call them out, announce your departure and be done. stop watching everything little thing they do to just talk about them more."
9659,2020-12-30 13:25:02,kmy3l4,"Good luck trying to get anyone to follow reason, this place is starting to turn into gurugossip, and i left that site because it became too negative. 

And i notice a lot of people try and get away with homophobic or misandry comments just because the person in question is racist, that doesn't excuse you from being a douchebag just because the said person in question is a douchebag."
9660,2020-12-30 14:04:56,kmy3l4,james charles and jeffree star fans mad huh?🤣
9661,2020-12-30 17:49:41,kmy3l4,"i agree to a certain point, but i don't think its late to make them go away - we've seen many big names go away simply by not giving them the attention they thrive in"
9662,2020-12-30 17:48:03,kmy3l4,which one is that? i would love to post there and not have to worry about offending people simply by stating the truth
9663,2020-12-30 15:12:06,kmy3l4,"most public figures THRIVE doing these harmful behavior. nikita dragun keeps getting called out, and nothing ever stops her. james charles keeps fucking up, but all he has to do is make an apology video and people forget about it. heck even shane dawson is EXPECTED to come back and i'm sure most people who are ""canceling"" him, will be watching him again."
9664,2020-12-30 15:06:57,kmy3l4,"Yikes on all the bikes indeed because I specifically said ""  it happens mostly under that person's social media "" - i'm not talking about on Reddit or anywhere outside that person's social media platforms. the cancel culture warriors tend to go to those places to criticize and post hate, they don't come to reddit.   

for example, james charles tiktok video that he got heat over, has more engagment than his usual stuff, care to explain why?"
9665,2020-12-30 14:22:01,kmy3l4,it's unfortunate you felt that way since that's not how it was intended.
9666,2020-12-31 06:16:53,kmy3l4,Thank you! I've learnt the most from your comment.
9667,2020-12-30 17:46:06,kmy3l4,i don't disagree
9668,2020-12-31 06:19:02,kmy3l4,this is exactly what I meant! but I don't think it resonated with people here because god knows if you dare tell people they are wrong here
9669,2020-12-31 06:19:27,kmy3l4,right!!!!
9670,2020-12-30 17:30:01,kmy3l4,Your post is stupid. You saying Jeff getting cancelled over a “fuck up” makes YOU sound like a fan of his
9671,2020-12-30 16:59:52,kmy3l4,Did you ever consider that your post and comments are simply just bad?
9672,2020-12-30 19:03:56,kmy3l4,Like who?
9673,2020-12-30 23:25:01,kmy3l4,"""Offending people by stating the truth""

9720,2020-12-29 15:40:19,kmfjrw,yes! and if i remember correctly jeffree was in cahoots with one of the band members of BOTD that was into minors...

9735,2020-12-29 17:00:37,kmfjrw,Yeah that sounds about right. Weirdo assholes will always flock towards other weirdo assholes.
9736,2020-12-29 16:30:24,kmfjrw,Oh god.  I’m embarrassed that my path could be so similar.  Jorf had me looking at rele-estate in Casper for a minute as an investment property lol.
9737,2020-12-29 18:07:22,kmfjrw,"Nikki Sixx just moved there too. Not Casper specifically, but I hope Nikki and Cobes cross paths one day. That'd be glorious."
9738,2020-12-29 18:34:07,kmfjrw,"It just goes to further show how middle of nowhere this middle of nowhere really is. Star can impress the yokels with his former fame, and while he is gay, all the $$$ and racist ideology will let him get a pass."
9739,2020-12-29 16:00:56,kmfjrw,Well the idea of a winter wash once a week is to keep the salt from eating your undercarriage. You don't want it to settle in and dry.
9740,2020-12-29 18:18:23,kmfjrw,Turn him what? Straight? lol. Cause he's already in the closest. His homophobia is off the Charts.
9741,2020-12-29 17:14:34,kmfjrw,Yes it was Davy Vanity. A known pedo. Jeff posted that he 100% saw something illegal and that he wouldn’t be working with Vanity anymore only to go on tour with him like the next year or something.
9742,2020-12-29 18:31:19,kmfjrw,"Oh wow you mean GOTH ICON Nikki Sixx from Motley Crue??? I'm sure JoRSh would love to meet him! He'd even show Nikki a thing or two on how to properly shred on the guitar. 

Cobes wouldn't get a record deal though. Sixx would get JEaLOUz of his EPic lifestyle and that all the wahmen in Casper wanna be with Cobra and not some loser like him who doesn't even have 16k Subscribers on YouToobZ"
9743,2020-12-30 16:03:37,kmfjrw,Cobes would show him a walk on the wild side.
9744,2020-12-29 19:43:06,kmfjrw,I've actually heard there is a lot of grumbling going on among the Wyoming natives right now about the large number of wealthy city/coastal celebrity types like Star and Kanye buying up ranches all over
9745,2020-12-29 16:13:22,kmfjrw,I’m down with that as long as the weather is going to be cold and dry.  I drive a nice car and live in Boston. If the snow is still melting I’m not getting my car washed. Ten minutes on the highway and it’s covered in salt again.
9746,2020-12-29 18:21:42,kmfjrw,Okay fair. He could definitely help bring Josh out.
9747,2020-12-29 17:47:30,kmfjrw,Jesus it's like 6 degrees of separation between Cobes and Jessi Slaughter. There's a fucking pair.
9748,2020-12-29 18:06:10,kmfjrw,"""Something illegal"" like both of those fools weren't snorting cocaine for breakfast. What a hero."
9749,2020-12-29 18:47:24,kmfjrw,"""Saw something illegal"" aka Rape of a 10 yo girl, but after all these years is STILL too much of a piece of shit to give a witness statement to the FBI, [whom Vanity is currently being investigated by](https://www.insider.com/dahvie-vanity-jessi-slaughter-you-done-goofed-blood-dance-floor-2020-4).

If Star wanted a way back into the good graces of the public that would be a guaranteed way to do it. So why doesn't she?

*(Pure Speculation:)* Because Vanity probably has similar dirt on HER too."

9755,2021-01-01 21:44:26,kmfjrw,Exactly mate.
9756,2020-12-29 20:20:21,kmfjrw,"Lol yep pretty much, part of why i'd imagine a lot of the local shitkickers give Jord so much trouble (whether real or imagined) is to let off steam about the changing landscape. A few generations ago a boglim in sharpie eye liner would've been strapped to a mule and sent out of town on permanent exile, now he gets money from drunk English college students and bored housewives living in the Suburbs of Chicago to eat disgusting food on camera and is allowed to wander the streets of Casper unmolested looking for snipes. Must get under their skin after awhile (in a different way than how Jord gets under ours)"
9757,2020-12-29 16:36:01,kmfjrw,Personally I’m not but I can’t speak for the fandom. I’m rooting for the Bills in the playoffs. They’ve been my second team since the early 90s when I was a Thurman Thomas fan and wanted to see Jim Kelly stick it to the Cowboys.
9758,2020-12-29 17:37:57,kmfjrw,"Haha good choice. Josh Allen, Diggs, and White are special players who hopefully have nice long careers. You guys are beyond spoiled and have all the glory. Its nice to have something for once."
9759,2020-12-29 17:57:40,kmfjrw,It was a great run. I wonder if Brady wanted to make a run at another ring outside of Belichick‘S system to shake the “system QB” label he’s been tagged with.
9760,2020-12-29 20:20:17,kmfjrw,It seems that's the case.

9764,2020-12-28 21:57:40,kly4sc,"Long shaggy dog story short, when I left the org and my family at the tender age of 17 and had no community I stumbled into a gay bar, technically it was a bar run by a gay couple, the clientele were off duty ladies of negotiable affection and a number of elderly homosexual gentlemen (old queens, their term not mine). Anyway, having no community and this being the mid 80's when LGBQT+ was at best LGB and that was only just being recognised though far from accepted, I found kindred spirits with people who had been abandoned by family for daring to live their lives by being true to their core nature. If not for these lovely pure spirited people I would not be the man I am today.

Why am I writing this? So when I say that it not only makes me so happy ( and a little weepy ) that dispite all the odds against you, you are also true to yourself. Even without knowing you that also makes me proud of you.

The way they treated me when I left was abominable. It hurt - a lot. I reminded them about that, and said that whilst I knew why they acted the way they did towards me, *understanding does not excuse*.

I am glad that you are happy, and that your brother has reached out to you. And I know that you will not treat him the way he treated you when he is ready to leave. But please let him know that he is accountable for his actions, and he needs to recognise the hurt he has caused so that he can learn what true forgiveness is, not the paltry version the witnesses display in front of others."

One of my sisters had a ""lesbian"" phase so not sure if she identifies or not. We have a few other extended family members (non-JW) that are gay as well...anyhow, please accept your brother as he'll recognize your struggle. Of course he was upset as he most likely was mimicking the JW teachings/parents' reactions.

The second time was when my dad was shopping for a new car and cut a deal with the dealership to buy five sedans at once (for company cars) and got her one as well."

I understand “their joy is my joy” and “I want to make them happy” and “this is my love language”. I just also seek to understand if it happens to be a one-sided thing. 

Correct me if I’m wrong but I’m assuming you’re a straight male so you’re a husband and not a wife-of-a-wife. Is it more often you buying stuff for your wife or does she do the same for you?

And the home loan is under both of us. I have saved up and bought him expensive gifts such as watches, chains, or hell a PS5. Or a TV.

If you think about the amount of money you spend on a bunch of little things, they also add up really quickly to exceed that $1000 mark. If you buy groceries a few times, that's $1000. If you buy a new computer setup that can easily exceed $1000. It's not really about who spends more, at the end of the day our money is in the same account, we're both paying just to live. If it's in the budget and he can afford to buy me a nicer car, then he can do that. He can decide that a portion of what he makes will now go toward this nice thing for me. And I can do the same.

We don't keep track of who spends more on gifts. If I want something I communicate that and we work around it. Whether that means saving up or just him outright getting it for me. Or me doing the same for him."
9811,2020-12-28 02:27:51,klfjpg,"Also he buys me small kitchen appliances, I could easily pick 2 and they would cost well over $1k. And it's not because it's expected. It's because he appreciates me and my passion and I his. We accommodate and support eachother. It's not about the money. Because in reality, we're both going to end up using the coffee maker and the juicer. We're both going to be using that bomb new fridge. We're both getting use out of all the things we get eachother. Not even from direct usage but he appreciates the gift which I gave him to show I appreciate him, and in turn it makes him appreciate me."

(I guess that if she flew over for a funeral there wouldn’t be time to quarantine, they don’t usually happen more than a week or two after the person died, so it wouldn’t add up)"
9878,2020-12-29 23:36:58,kkv77g,"Yeah, that does make sense too!
I just don't think it's fair to get on her for going to a funeral and saw a friend, ya know? I know people who have gone to visit a friend during the quarantine. 
I say this since, RBK had a gender reveal (?) party with people (that also did not bubble before seeing her) and yet she is not on the this list for COVID accountability."
9879,2020-12-30 00:08:34,kkv77g,"On that I have to disagree, I think it is 100% fair to say that flying to the other side of the world to attend a funeral and to see a friend is not okay. I live in italy and for MONTHS not even the closest family members could hold funerals, let alone see other people, why the hell do influencers get to do what they want? I know it’s hard when someone dies and a funeral is a way for her to get closure and say goodbye, but as it is for her it is for billions of other people. Why can we “common folk” not even say goodbye to our parents and grandparents who live in the same city, but she gets to fly thousands of kilometers and then even go visit friends? And as I judge her negatively I judge every other person who visited friends when they weren’t allowed to negatively, it doesn’t become okay just because others are doing it too.

I don’t know the exact guidelines in the USA, I don’t know if it was okay for RBK to visit family or not, so I won’t comment on that. But honestly at this point I don’t even care about the legal aspect anymore, I just wish everyone would start using common sense. I don’t know if RBK and her whole family had been quarantining for months and then saw each other for a couple of hours, and if they didn’t then they’re in the wrong too, but I’m 100% sure that going to an airport, taking a plane, flying to a country thousands and thousands of kilometers away and gathering in groups is really irresponsible and, frankly, priviledged behaviour"
9880,2020-12-30 01:11:41,kkv77g,"Yeah, ahah I think we are going to disagree. 

I don't know about your culture, but funerals are really, really important in African cultures. 
It's not a privilege of rich people. I know other people who when to funerals during this time. I'm not going to shit on them. In the end people CHOSE not to go to those funerals. You can't blame others for making a different choice. You don't have much of a right to claim that others can't simply because you made the decision not to. 
People on this thread act as if, y'all never left your house since March. Not for groceries, the doctor, etc. 

We are not in this on-going pandemic because influencers are the only ones traveling around. Last time I checked, it's cuz everyone is breaking quarantine, all over the world. I'm not ok with people just traveling for the sake of it, because of the spread. I want people to wear their masks and follow quarantine protocol as much as possible.
 But, if there is something that is important (such as a funeral), especially culturally, then I'm not going to shit on them. Are you singling out the people in your life doing these things? 

As for RBK, they did not follow quarantine protocol, so they should also be on that list. No excuses should be made for her either, following your logic. Especially because she was pregnant at the time. Add her to list."
9881,2020-12-30 01:36:55,kkv77g,"I think I explained myself poorly, we weren’t ALLOWED to have funerals. By law. For months. The corpses of people who had covid were put onto military trucks outside hospitals and carried away without any family member getting to say goodbye or to have a funeral. You’d see these long caravans of military trucks on TV and they were buried in designated areas by the military without any ceremony, it was heartbreaking. I stand behind what I said about priviledge, cause who the hell gets to fly to the other side of the world during a global pandemic to attend a funeral and see friends? Rich and priviledged people, that’s who. Funerals are really important in our culture too. I don’t know if more or less than in African ones and I don’t care, that’s not the point. Just a week ago my best friend’s grandpa couldn’t attend his wife’s funeral who died of covid. Is that fair? No. Is that the reality for a lot of people right now? Yes. And even if it was permitted at the time to fly to the UK just for a funeral, was it the responsible thing to do? Certainly not.

Obviously the pandemic isn’t the influencers’ fault. (And again, I’m mad at everybody who doesn’t follow the rules, but this is BGC, so we’re talking about them.) But seeing them so blatantly ignore the guidelines and don’t care about the influence it has on their followers is infuriating. And even if, in a fantasy world, they didn’t influence anyone with their actions, do they really have to flex their ability to travel or do collabs on us, when some people can’t or choose not to see their family or friends to protect them/for the greater good? If they only want to enjoy the positive sides of being famous and am influencer without accepting the responsibility that comes with it, they don’t deserve anything of what their followers have given them. 

I didn’t know RBK didn’t follow quarantine protocol, then it’s only right for her to be on the list too."
9882,2020-12-30 02:02:19,kkv77g,"Hey, big thanks for the clarification! :)  Sorry for the harshness of my earlier response. That makes sense and I do understand where you are coming from. Not having that choice at all is devastating. 
I am sorry to hear about your best friends grandfather's situation. It isn't fair. 
While it can be considered irresponsible (I agree with you there, even if the UK temporarily allowed it), I do still give a pass to those who go to funerals. So long as they do what they can to stay safe, then for me (in my opinion) it's fine. But, that's my personal opinion on it. But I do understand why you and others are absolutely not ok with it. 
It's crazy, I know someone in real life who is just in Miami for vacation, and I'm just flabbergasted by the hypocrisy of their actions. Despite the things they said in regard to the pandemic and safety. 

As for the influencers... they should lose their platform and it does further expose the disgusting disparity of rich, privileged people. They are not being punished for their acts and that exacerbates the problem. This pandemic would have been a good opportunity to flex and redefine like many workplaces, schooling, etc. has. I'm not sure how lists like these will help or what they do in bringing about accountability? I mainly say this because, thus far influencers don't seem to face any consequences for their actions. Not really sure what best solution is for actual consequences for their actions. 

But, trust me, you and I are pretty much on the same page (minus a few things here and there)."
9883,2020-12-30 02:31:00,kkv77g,"I maybe would give her a pass if 1) she flew there, social distanced and stayed in her hotel quarantining the whole time except for the funeral, 2) she didn’t meet anyone else outside of that funeral and 3) she didn’t post anything about any of it on social media. Cause otherwise she’s 1) not trying to be as responsible as possible during a global health crisis, 2) not just there to say goodbye and mourn someone she lost and on top of everything 3) flexing her ability to travel and see friends on her followers who are most likely stuck at home. But since she did all of these things she doesn’t get a pass from me. I truly understand the desire to attend a loved ones funeral and probably I’d want to try anything to attend it too, but sometimes we have to look at the bigger picture, especially when millions of people look up to you and see you as a rolemodel.

Yeah I know, it would take for the majority of their audience to stand up to them and demand for them to be responsible or else start to unfollow them. What they care about is their stats, so that’s how you deliver a message to them. Problem is: a lot of the tiktok stars have children as their audience, so that’s not going to happen. In the older creators comment section I occasionally see comments calling them out, but even they have too many hardcore stans, in whose eyes they can do no wrong or who just don’t care. So, while the utility of lists like this isn’t huge, it certainly tells people like me who I might have to reconsider supporting even after all this. My unfollow won’t change anything for them, but it helps me cleanse my recommended videos section, cause I’m sick of supporting people whose views don’t align with mine on such major issues

Edit: oh and as you said, don’t even get me started on the hypocrisy of people posting on twitter or IG to follow guidelines and then posting collabs on YT the same day."

9887,2020-12-27 04:55:51,kkus9f,Second this! Michaels has a great selection of tiny paint brushes that’ll be much cheaper than makeup brushes. And Michaels has great coupons too
9888,2020-12-27 09:12:53,kkus9f,Thank you I'll give it a try x
9889,2021-01-27 13:39:47,kkus9f,"Really great idea thank you, I have art brushes now which work amazingly, but fantastic idea for the future :)"

9915,2020-12-26 17:41:50,kkky94,"I ordered one.  I wish they weren't doing the JS only bags because I would like to try other products, but I went for the JS one since I know I will like the stuff I get. I guess they were worried about  hater backlash. :/"
9916,2020-12-26 17:50:47,kkky94,"I was only ae to get the regular, bit still stoked to get one!"
9917,2020-12-26 22:51:01,kkky94,"I wanted the regular lucky bag but didn't make it online before they sold out. I was about to buy the JSC regular lucky bag, but decided it wasn't worth it for $10 shipping plus tax since I'd probably get a lot of repeats anyway. 

My favorite thing about Beautylish is that I can always get free shipping so the $10 or $15 dollar shipping was a huge turnoff 🙄"
9918,2020-12-26 17:50:13,kkky94,Shipping $15.00 *cringe*
9919,2020-12-26 17:02:52,kkky94,Just got mine 😬😬😬
9920,2020-12-26 17:12:01,kkky94,Can you only get one for your address ? I’m afraid to try to get the smaller size
9921,2020-12-26 17:53:04,kkky94,"Can the JS bags be ""extra lucky"" too? Or is that just for the regular bags?"
9922,2020-12-26 17:55:35,kkky94,"I forgot to sign up for early access and I""m on the website now but don't see a tab for the lucky bags anywhere! HELP!!"
9923,2020-12-26 18:02:47,kkky94,Jeffree Star’s mystery boxes are still available! It’s just the mini box and deluxe box If anyone is still interested. But beautylish always delivers!
9924,2020-12-26 18:03:08,kkky94,got mine through the app cause it wasn't showing up on the website and I couldn't find it anywhere!
9925,2020-12-26 17:38:30,kkky94,I don't know which one to get?!? Which one y'all getting???
9926,2020-12-26 17:44:05,kkky94,I’ve often got JSC stuff in my bags! I always do the regular lucky bag
9927,2020-12-27 03:21:49,kkky94,"This was me. I signed up for presale, got the link, clicked, thought it over and realized I already have a lot of JSC stuff (especially the stuff I'd actually wear) and I didn't feel like buying it and risking doubles or stuff I wouldn't wear because I don't want the hassle of selling things off. So I exited out and bought a video game and a jogging set from a store I love that had an awesome sale today."
9928,2020-12-26 21:42:53,kkky94,JSC tried that with me on a mirror and I noped that outta my cart and decided to chance the boxes.
9929,2020-12-26 19:26:45,kkky94,"It says 1 per address, name or billing. If you know someone at another address where you could send it maybe you could get both."
9930,2020-12-26 22:18:29,kkky94,Last year they were! Some extra lucky got conspiracy when they were sold out everywhere IIRC
9931,2020-12-26 18:02:44,kkky94,use the launch app. the website keeps glitching
9932,2020-12-26 17:45:41,kkky94,"I was tempted to do xl but just did the regular lucky bag! I have a ton of JSC stuff and they often do JSC products in the regular/xl bags. If you haven’t done it before, the regular ole lucky bag is a good place to start!"
9933,2020-12-26 19:22:57,kkky94,"I think they changed it up this year, so the jsc o e is all jsc and the other ones don't include his stuff. I think probably they are trying to avoid backlash from people who don't like him.  Did they have jsc only ones in previous years?"
9934,2020-12-26 23:12:14,kkky94,Oh wow! So now I'm extra excited. Thank you!
9935,2020-12-26 19:28:13,kkky94,This year they announced J* stuff Will Only be in the J* bags. They changed it.
9936,2020-12-26 17:47:11,kkky94,Thanks for your input! I ended up getting the regular JS box.💜
9937,2020-12-26 22:18:04,kkky94,They had a regular bag last year but I don't think a lot of people liked getting the holiday VLL set \[the 5 set that had a white and green color\] in their non-JSC bags
9938,2020-12-27 08:55:53,kkky94,"The JSC ones are newish, they’ve only done them for the last few years as far as I can remember."
9939,2020-12-27 08:54:10,kkky94,Yep I know a lot of people were upset by that
9940,2020-12-26 17:02:50,kkkwaj,"I got an XL :)

For $178.13 it better be friggin amazing."
9941,2020-12-26 17:05:00,kkkwaj,I got the XL! It probably has more to do with people being fed up with lackluster boxes (myself included) then actual luck but I’m still going to pat myself on the back and pretend it’s because of my quick reflexes 😂
9942,2020-12-26 17:08:43,kkkwaj,"I can't believe I got an XL bag this year. I missed out last year but scored an XL the year before in 2018.

I do agree that last year's bag was mediocre but it's been such a depressing year for me and the planet so as least I will have something to anticipate in January even if it isn't fabulous - and the packaging is so beautiful as well.

The XL bag was really great in 2018 - at least for me since I got an amazing brush which I never would have actually bought for myself.

At any rate, I am lucky (no pun intended) that my income hasn't been affected and I have spent nothing on usual stuff like entertainment, restaurants. I did tip the guys in my building really well and donated quite a bit to the Food Bank so why not have the thrill of my makeup slot machine. :-)."
9943,2020-12-26 18:10:26,kkkwaj,I wish everyone getting them luck luck luck! I got an xl last year that was horrible and I couldn’t believe I allowed myself to spend nearly $200 on it. This year I’m definitely passing. I think it’s good to look at the old posts and see what’s the worst box and think if you’re ok getting that. I think we all think we’re going to get a great box or the extra lucky box but just be ok with getting something you don’t like before purchasing
9944,2020-12-26 19:07:15,kkkwaj,I’m kind of bummed that I had to pass on this. My cat just had to go to the vet for a big issue and I need to save money right now to pay the vet bills. His health comes before my beauty this year!
9945,2020-12-26 17:09:12,kkkwaj,"Couldn’t believe I actually managed to snag a XL!

Really hoping for a Natasha Denona palette but we’ll see"
9946,2020-12-26 18:33:09,kkkwaj,"I got the XL again this year; last years XL was ridiculously bad, so hopefully this years will be better."
9947,2020-12-26 17:02:20,kkkwaj,The launch app made that so easy.
9948,2020-12-26 17:03:48,kkkwaj,Got an XL. I hope this year is better than last.
9949,2020-12-26 17:02:44,kkkwaj,"There wasn't a shade choice on the XL, right? I just put it in bag and paid  but i don't think i saw a shade choice."
9950,2020-12-26 17:06:48,kkkwaj,Got the XL for the first time. Hoping for a great box. Last years regular box was kind of a let down after previous amazing years.
9951,2020-12-26 17:09:15,kkkwaj,"I’m glad I checked here. My link was giving me issues, but I saw all the comments her about the launch app! This will be my first lucky bag!"
9952,2020-12-26 17:16:00,kkkwaj,I got an error message and couldn’t order (still can’t lol) anyone else have this issue??
9953,2020-12-26 22:06:05,kkkwaj,5 pm est and both JSC boxes are available.
9954,2020-12-26 17:08:36,kkkwaj,"I ended up with 2 XL bags when the site glitched and I refreshed. 

&#x200B;

I emailed them to see if they can cancel one, but I'll take both if not. Oh well."
9955,2020-12-26 17:12:47,kkkwaj,"Also got the XL! I canceled all my other subscription boxes at the start of the year so this is my one surprise of the year, lol. I’ve only purchased the XL once out of 5 or so years, and my regular bags were much better than the XL so we’ll see."
9956,2020-12-26 17:13:55,kkkwaj,Got mine no issue using the app. Actually got an alert about 45 seconds earlier. Had a $60 credit so I got the xl bag. I’m hoping for some great. Coming 2021 I’ve committed to so not shopping for a few months!
9957,2020-12-26 17:15:53,kkkwaj,"Very odd because I ordered the Launch and scored an XL.

However when I access the site on my web browser it still has ""coming soon"" and I couldn't even access the page.

I never got the email letting me know my ""early access"" was available. I still haven't received an email confirming the purchase but the Launch App shows my purchase and I wasn't able to purchase a second one - not that I was trying to be greedy but just testing to see whether my order had actually gone through because I was somewhat in a state of shock. 

I wasn't even sure whether I had ordered correctly since there wasn't a Fair option. Please god don't send me one of those overpriced hair bundles that some people got last year. I use shampoo and that's about it because I don't have any kind of hair issues.

I wonder if that has something to do with why everyone seems to have scored an XL since you can't order from the site - or at least I can't. 

Also there is economic hardship and uncertainty so perhaps that has also impacted purchasing"
9958,2020-12-26 18:59:35,kkkwaj,"First year ordering and got an XL! I cancelled all my subscription boxes this year, so giving myself an end of the year treat... hopefully it'll be worth it!"
9959,2020-12-26 21:17:36,kkkwaj,I have only been doing this for 3 years. I never get an XL.  This year is my first XL bag!!! I hope it is a good one.  This should be a very lucky process for me because December 26 is my birthday 🎂 The first year was okay it was fun. My items were okay. The next year I tried for the XL didn’t get it so I didn’t get a regular one. This year I finally snagged the XL.   Last year seemed to be a disappointment for a lot of people.  So I was okay passing it up. Fingers crossed 🤞
9960,2020-12-26 17:09:03,kkkwaj,wow that was way quicker than last year with the launch app.
9961,2020-12-26 17:15:14,kkkwaj,Well it looks like I accidentally ordered 2 XL lucky bags? It wasn’t working so I opened a new tab and then I guess both went through at once. Do you think they’ll auto cancel?
9962,2020-12-26 17:23:02,kkkwaj,"I also got an XL via the app. Kinda worried though. I skipped last year and only read the reviews after purchasing this year’s (ugh, lol)."
9963,2020-12-26 18:10:42,kkkwaj,"There weren’t any spoilers this year, right? 😔"
9964,2020-12-26 21:06:58,kkkwaj,All sold out. Except the J* ones ...
9965,2020-12-26 22:26:09,kkkwaj,This is random but if anyone decides to not keep the cute wrapping paper they always include - I would love it. I absolutely adore the ones I got last year when I bought a bag LOOOL
9966,2020-12-27 01:58:07,kkkwaj,Oh hope all of you get super lucky!
9967,2020-12-26 17:04:01,kkkwaj,https://www.beautylish.com/shop/lucky-bag-2021
9968,2020-12-26 17:08:36,kkkwaj,"I got my first XL bag! So excited, I've been really happy with my past two regular bags."
9969,2020-12-26 17:09:15,kkkwaj,"I got an XL. I am going to be so mad at myself if I only use $25 of the products, but it has been a shit year. Maybe this will be truly lucky. 😉"
9970,2020-12-26 17:50:50,kkkwaj,I'm on the website but I don't see a spot for it anywhere...am I looking in the wrong place?
9971,2020-12-26 18:10:41,kkkwaj,"Ordered my first bag, I’m so exited!! This post reminded me, so thanks! I always get mad at myself when I see everyone’s posts about their bags every year and forgot to order haha!"
9972,2020-12-26 18:36:30,kkkwaj,"... and now we wait... 


(Ughhhhhh.... hurrrrry up and get here already, JAN 15th!!! 😂)"
9973,2020-12-26 19:12:39,kkkwaj,Got N xl. My first bag ever
9974,2020-12-26 17:04:41,kkkwaj,Got the XL. I hope it was better than last year
9975,2020-12-26 21:40:14,kkkwaj,I had to go for a regular bag being international.. I swore I wouldn’t get another one after last years... it wasn’t terrible but a lot of it wasn’t my thing. Yet here I am again!
9976,2020-12-26 22:05:57,kkkwaj,This is my first time ordering. I just purchased the regular bag. Has everyone been really happy in the past with the purchase? I am hoping it is a good investment!! 🥰
9977,2020-12-26 20:58:00,kkkwaj,"I wasn't going to (because with Ipsy I have more stuff than I'll ever use, and let's be honest - where am I going?) , but then I got FOMO and was able to pick up a regular bag. I did just check to see what was left, tho, and find it interesting that both J* bags are still available ~4 hours after early access..."
9978,2020-12-26 17:03:23,kkkwaj,edit- I kept getting error messages when I went through the browser. Downloaded the app and check out was great! Picked up the XL- did I need it? No. But it’s my first lucky bag. I’m excited!
9979,2020-12-26 17:00:47,kkkwaj,Didn’t get the early access link
9980,2020-12-26 17:46:06,kkkwaj,I give up keep getting page error message on app and on webpage
9981,2020-12-26 19:43:25,kkkwaj,Missed the XL...got the regular and I’m already regretting it...
9982,2020-12-27 02:34:10,kkkwaj,I stayed strong and DIDN'T get a lucky bag this year!! After last year's disaster I kept telling myself I wouldn't get one but legit it was still hard not to buy this morning. I hope this year's lucky bag's make me regret the decision though!
9983,2020-12-26 17:48:50,kkkwaj,"This is probably a very stupid question but I've been a loyal Beautylish customer for a few years now and I don't remember seeing anything about their launch app, yet many people here are talking about it as if it was a known fact. I don't recall seeing anything about the app, leading up to this event or otherwise, and if I hadn't looked at Instagram and hurriedly downloaded the app I might have missed the XL because I kept getting an error message on the site.

So does anyone recall when or how they advertised this app, and if they said anything about needing the app in order to get an XL? Because by the time I went back to the site and refreshed out of curiosity, it said the XL was sold out so I might have snagged one of the very last ones through the app. I feel like a dummy but I swear I looked back through emails and saw nothing about the app! I hope no one missed out on an XL just because they didn't know about it."
9984,2020-12-26 19:11:08,kkkwaj,I was so tempted to order a regular and an XL one. Then I  saw their flash sale yesterday and completely dropped the idea of picking up any bag. 😂
9985,2020-12-26 16:53:51,kkkwaj,I’m getting excited!
9986,2020-12-27 01:12:52,kkkwaj,"Do they typically restock lucky bags? My BFF wants one, but they are sold out. She’s has a terrible year and losing out on this was another small pinhole in her bubble."
9987,2020-12-27 05:04:01,kkkwaj,I’m in Canada - so only option for me was regular bag - I don’t consider the JSC an option 😜
9988,2020-12-27 06:16:37,kkkwaj,"I am glad I uninstalled their launch app to avoid buying the XL bag but I was surprised to also see a winter sale with (mostly lipstick) discounts from various brands. Nothing exciting in that sale either, the black friday sale was better."
9989,2020-12-26 17:43:18,kkkwaj,forgot to do the early access so I'm gonna attempt to get the JSC XL box when it opens at 10am for everyone! wish me luck!

9992,2020-12-26 18:24:46,kkkwaj,"I got the XL last year and wound up with a bag worth $435, I gave away two items and either went through, still use, or have repurchased 75% of the bag. I was pretty darn happy with it, but I know it's not always the case - good luck to you and everyone else who got a bag today!"
9993,2020-12-26 17:03:55,kkkwaj,I was tempted but went with my usual regular bag lol
9994,2020-12-26 17:30:22,kkkwaj,I was going to & accidentally ordered the regular 🤦🏻‍♀️
9995,2020-12-26 17:05:58,kkkwaj,I got the xl too. Usually get the regular.
9996,2020-12-27 01:22:14,kkkwaj,Exactly my thoughts on being surprised five minutes after ten that the xl went through! Hope we get bags we like :)
9997,2020-12-26 18:14:23,kkkwaj,I sprung for the XL for the same reasons. Luckily I have the income this year but my mental and physical health have been affected by this year. Happy to have something to look forward to at the beginning of 2021.
9998,2020-12-26 18:37:21,kkkwaj,My 2018 bag was also great! Hoping for the same quality with this XL bag. Definitely needed a pick-me-up after this long year.
9999,2020-12-26 17:19:49,kkkwaj,I just tried and the XL was sold out. Got the regular tho.
10000,2020-12-27 23:42:14,kkkwaj,Bragger. Lol 🤣😭
10001,2020-12-27 06:01:23,kkkwaj,"That's exactly what I did, look at people's old posts and that saved me from buying the XL bag. I am too afraid of getting dupes. I also invested in Natasha's Triochrome and Gold palettes this year so that was already my treat to me."
10002,2020-12-26 19:19:35,kkkwaj,Aww 🤗 you are a wonderful cat mom! He is very blessed and lucky to have you. I hope everything works out and he recovers ASAP! 💜
10003,2020-12-26 21:03:10,kkkwaj,I hope he feels better soon! 🤞
10004,2020-12-26 17:17:11,kkkwaj,Same!
10005,2020-12-26 17:03:29,kkkwaj,"I agree, while it wouldn't process my payment through Paypal for some reason I had my debit card info in it already so it made it a breeze!!"
10006,2020-12-26 17:04:34,kkkwaj,For real! I didn’t see the email come in right at 11 (which isn’t unusual for big launches) so I just went to the app and it took like two seconds to do
10007,2020-12-26 17:03:39,kkkwaj,"Sooo easy. You don’t even have to refresh it! 

Awesome."
10008,2020-12-26 17:04:35,kkkwaj,Same! Ordered!
10009,2020-12-26 17:25:42,kkkwaj,Saaaaame 🤞
10010,2020-12-26 17:03:43,kkkwaj,I didn’t either
10011,2020-12-26 17:05:08,kkkwaj,I didn’t see one either - just for the regular bag.
10012,2020-12-26 17:09:38,kkkwaj,"I see a lot of people saying they got the XL for the first time, I wonder if that means fewer people are purchasing."
10013,2020-12-26 17:08:07,kkkwaj,I was so tempted because I’ve never got one but after last year...I went with the regular again. I’m hoping they’re good this year!
10014,2020-12-26 18:34:53,kkkwaj,"I’m hoping this year is a lot better, there were a lot of good releases at the beginning of the year that should be making their way into the boxes plus they’ve picked up quite a few new brands!"
10015,2020-12-26 17:21:26,kkkwaj,Same here! I’ve tried different browsers and different devices but no joy. :( I even emailed customer support but who knows how long before I hear back from them.
10016,2020-12-26 17:22:17,kkkwaj,"Me! The XL says they're sold out, but when trying to pre-order fair-med, im getting the ""sorry, that page is broken"". Not sure if sold out, but hoping there's more stock at 10 pst."
10017,2020-12-26 23:12:07,kkkwaj,"I tried all different devices and browsers as well as the app and my links were still broken. The customer service rep was able to help me purchase the original lucky box which was very nice of them. It was just so weird that no matter what I did, I couldn’t get the links to work. 🤷🏻‍♀️"
10018,2020-12-27 23:07:45,kkkwaj,Over 24 hours later and JSC still available...hahahahaha
10019,2020-12-26 17:24:03,kkkwaj,I would be interested in buying 1 if they don’t let you cancel! I have been trying to get an XL for 4 years 😂
10020,2020-12-26 19:25:23,kkkwaj,I had the same thing happen to me! They’re supposed to be one per person so I was surprised both orders show as confirmed pre-order and PayPal has authorization holds for both. I emailed as well so I’m curious what their response it.
10021,2020-12-26 17:45:17,kkkwaj,If not I’ll buy one off you!
10022,2020-12-27 08:53:16,kkkwaj,"Honestly I’m not sure I’ve seen any spoilers any other years but nope, none that I know of!"
10023,2020-12-26 23:12:10,kkkwaj,Love to see it 😶
10024,2020-12-26 17:55:38,kkkwaj,I wasn’t able to get it on the website. I ended up downloading the beautylish launch app that people are mentioning here and I was able to buy it on the app.
10025,2020-12-26 20:08:17,kkkwaj,Congrats!?Me also first bag
10026,2020-12-27 08:52:42,kkkwaj,The worst part! I’m SO impatient. I get so excited and then ruin it by constantly checking the Instagram hashtags to see what everyone in California gets when they start shipping lol
10027,2020-12-27 00:17:35,kkkwaj,"In previous years, yes. 

Last year, no. 

Search this sub for “Beautylish” or “Lucky” and you’ll see everybody’s unboxings from last year."
10028,2020-12-27 08:45:09,kkkwaj,"I recommend checking out the #beautylishluckybag hashtag on Instagram if you have it, it gives you a good idea of what comes in the boxes. While the items vary year to year, we do see a lot of the same brands (ABH, Farmacy, Viseart, there’s usually Wayne Goss makeup brushes, Stila, Jouer, JSC, Charlotte Tilbury, Natasha Denona, Sugarpill, Kevin Aucoin, etc) or you can do the hashtag above with a year at the end to see what went out for that particular year.

Last year was a bit of a miss but in years prior, yes! I’ve been doing this for more years then I can count now and there’s only been two bags (including last years) that I was pretty disappointed in. The other one (not last year) was only because I did a ton of makeup buying that year and already had basically everything I got. I did get redemption by giving away the stuff to people who couldn’t really afford to purchase high end makeup and they were super excited about it, so that was fun! One of my favorite things to do."
10029,2020-12-26 17:14:03,kkkwaj,no not yet
10030,2020-12-26 17:02:01,kkkwaj,"It's live on the app, but not the website from what I've seen.

&#x200B;

Just got the email with a link attached!"
10031,2020-12-26 17:01:22,kkkwaj,"Big launches sometimes take a few minutes, it’ll come. I haven’t either"
10032,2020-12-26 17:01:30,kkkwaj,Me neither is it out yet
10033,2020-12-26 20:07:46,kkkwaj,Why you regret? Me actually had a chance to select any  but as it is my first time I think it good idea to buy regular and maybe next year -XL.
10034,2020-12-26 18:40:15,kkkwaj,"The early access signup, after you submit the email, had a little logo for the app and encouraged me to download it. So I did that a month or so ago."
10035,2020-12-26 17:57:01,kkkwaj,I had no clue. Even the email they sent out with the link was worthless. Had to come here and learn about the app to get it figured out. Thank you Reddit fam!
10036,2020-12-26 18:48:42,kkkwaj,I think I either saw it in an email for a launch I was signed up for or read about it on the FAQ lucky bag page.
10037,2020-12-26 19:40:38,kkkwaj,"I just googled “beautylish lucky bag” a few months back and one of the pages I saw said to download the app, so I did!"
10038,2020-12-27 03:37:40,kkkwaj,"They did advertise the launch app a while back (it had to have been almost a year ago now but I’m also terrible with time frames so it could’ve been longer) - I remember getting an email advertising it to “keep up with new launches” and be able to check out quickly. 

It wasn’t specific for getting lucky bags, and I don’t think you needed to get the app to be able to get an XL. Unfortunately with site traffic overloads, a lot of “popular” launches like this are slowed down so they don’t always happen on time, and the order in which people gain access to purchase is usually all over the place. I’m guessing the website was overloaded (probably way more so than the app) so access to the bags in the app was available sooner and the super easy/fast checkout allowed people to get in and out quickly. Where as the website takes a bit longer and probably had way more traffic bogging it down."
10039,2020-12-26 16:58:08,kkkwaj,Same! So close
10040,2020-12-26 16:55:00,kkkwaj,Same!
10041,2020-12-27 06:06:36,kkkwaj,They do sometimes.  I think it might be canceled orders or people that didn't follow rules and ordered more than one bag.
10042,2020-12-27 01:14:26,kkkwaj,"They do not, unfortunately."
10043,2020-12-28 18:18:35,kkkwaj,I actually just snagged one! I've been stalking the website and saw one so I snapped it up. I went back to check the page to see if any were left (and make a post here) but they're out of stock after my purchase. I say just stalk the page and hope!
10044,2020-12-26 17:45:35,kkkwaj,you should have no problem getting it. i just check and their still available and it doesn’t seem like those sell out as fast
10045,2020-12-26 23:32:56,kkkwaj,Is the JSC one a new thing for this year? Does it mean only products from JSC? I'm so confused about this.
10046,2020-12-26 19:31:36,kkkwaj,Thank you!! 🤞🤞🤞
10047,2020-12-26 17:05:10,kkkwaj,Yeah I’m positive that I’ll regret it but I can’t help myself lol
10048,2020-12-26 17:54:05,kkkwaj,Oh dang did you at least get your correct shade?
10049,2020-12-26 22:01:32,kkkwaj,"My PayPal glitched and the XL bag  order went through twice. I was, thankfully, able to cancel one."
10050,2020-12-26 17:05:14,kkkwaj,No shade choice for me either.
10051,2020-12-26 19:22:43,kkkwaj,"Definitely agree. Fewer people purchasing. Last yeah I was clicking refresh over and over until the bag become available, purchased the XL came here and so many people were disappointed moments later, as the XL sold out. This year I wasn’t paying attention and when I looked down at my phone, I had a notification form the launch app from 16 mins ago. I hopped and on and was able to get the XL. So i think after the disappointment last year, less chose to get the XL. I’m a glutton for punishment for though lol!"
10052,2020-12-26 17:16:23,kkkwaj,I'm thinking the same thing. Hopefully they aren't putting less value in them in order to have more to sell! This was the first year I've been able to get one.
10053,2020-12-26 17:30:33,kkkwaj,You’ll need to download the launch app. I could t access through my browser either. Downloaded the app and it worked.
10054,2020-12-26 17:24:37,kkkwaj,Same. I tried on my phone & computer on different browsers. I think their web ordering was messed up this time (seems like most people used the app to get it) kinda sucks
10055,2020-12-26 17:26:28,kkkwaj,try the launch app. it did the same thing for me on the browser and then when i switched to the app it worked perfectly
10056,2021-01-13 07:40:51,kkkwaj,Which app were you using? From everything I’ve read online it sounds like the regular Beautylish app wasn’t allowing ordering and the bags had to be ordered through their Launch Club app.
10057,2020-12-26 17:28:12,kkkwaj,I'll see what they say about canceling one!
10058,2020-12-26 19:40:30,kkkwaj,They got back to me quickly and issued a refund for one of them. All is well! I felt really bad because I don't need 2 and I wasn't trying to game the system or anything like that.
10059,2020-12-26 23:00:39,kkkwaj,"I was able to cancel the erroneous second order, sorry about that"
10060,2020-12-26 17:02:53,kkkwaj,I used the app and got an xl!
10061,2020-12-26 22:44:05,kkkwaj,Idk...I unsubscribed to all my boxes because of product overload. I’m just worried I’ll get stuff I won’t use.
10062,2020-12-26 18:49:18,kkkwaj,"Ah ok, it might have been an email I didn't get because I was already signed up when the notices started going out. Thank you!"
10063,2020-12-26 19:25:24,kkkwaj,Same!
10064,2020-12-26 17:59:42,kkkwaj,"Right! I ultimately did get one so I'm glad for that, and I know it's just makeup but I really enjoy this event and would have been super bummed to not get one this year. Thank goodness for the people who posted about the app!"
10065,2020-12-26 18:50:50,kkkwaj,"I do see a sentence down at the bottom of the FAQs about the app, I must have missed it or not thought I needed it since I knew I'd be home. But I have it now!"
10066,2020-12-26 16:59:23,kkkwaj,Couple seconds now!
10067,2020-12-26 17:01:19,kkkwaj,Hmm I have not received any email
10068,2020-12-27 02:45:20,kkkwaj,I thought they did last year?
10069,2020-12-28 21:54:21,kkkwaj," No it’s been around for a few years now (but not long overall) but yes, it’s only JSC products!"
10070,2020-12-26 19:22:36,kkkwaj,"I did, thank goodness 😂"
10071,2020-12-26 17:35:24,kkkwaj,"Omg, that was incredibly easy! I didn’t even know they had a launch app. From downloading to getting my order confirmation took all of 2 minutes. Wow. Thank you!!!"
10072,2020-12-26 17:44:01,kkkwaj,Ah I wish I knew that lol. I was able to get the regular on the launch app but missed the XL :(
10073,2020-12-26 17:51:39,kkkwaj,Omg thank you! Worked like a charm
10074,2020-12-26 17:30:19,kkkwaj,Wow thanks! That worked perfect & was so easy. Got my bag!! Good luck to everyone to get good stuff :]
10075,2021-01-18 18:07:20,kkkwaj,I was just using my internet browser. I had no idea about the launch app honestly but I downloaded it that day after learning about it but that was also not working.
10076,2020-12-26 20:34:52,kkkwaj,"I felt the same way! Especially since they’re sold out now. I hope they get back to me soon, their customer service is great."
10077,2020-12-27 03:33:11,kkkwaj,"It likely would’ve gotten cancelled anyway, they only allow one box per address!"
10078,2020-12-26 17:03:59,kkkwaj,Very nice! I just got the regular box but here's hoping we both get lucky!
10079,2020-12-27 01:36:17,kkkwaj,I recently did a declutter and it’s so eye opening to realize that 80% were from sub boxes.
10080,2020-12-27 14:33:13,kkkwaj,Yay! I will be using it for new beautylish launches from now on!
10081,2020-12-27 03:02:02,kkkwaj,When did they do it? A day after or so? It would save us from stalking the page every hour!
10082,2020-12-26 17:35:12,kkkwaj,i’m so glad it worked for you!!
10083,2020-12-27 03:28:00,kkkwaj,I’d sign up for their emails and have your email notifications on. It’s rare they restock (I’ve done this for quite a few years now) but on the rare occasions they do they typically send out emails letting everyone know there’s limited quantities up for grabs!
10084,2020-12-26 04:03:33,kkak1t,Tom Haiku
10085,2021-01-09 17:47:40,kkak1t,Don't ruin Voldemort like that 🤮
10086,2020-12-26 03:00:33,kkaa7y,"Jevfefe Star needs to take his racism, and his misogyny, and his alleged sexual assaultive behavior, and fade into oblivion."
10087,2020-12-26 02:22:41,kkaa7y,Disappointing
10088,2020-12-26 21:03:35,kkaa7y,I was super disappointed when I saw this
10089,2020-12-26 02:11:58,kkaa7y,I met Jeffree Star at Warped Tour in maybe 2003? Rude AF. Could have been just an off day but I was a little turned off.
10090,2020-12-27 01:07:12,kkaa7y,"I haven't followed any of this MUA drama, but tagging them AND hashtagging, someone certainly seems very desperate for their attention"
10091,2020-12-26 02:40:41,kkaa7y,Eww
10092,2020-12-27 01:58:38,kkaa7y,Is one of the ornaments Jeffree Starr brand or something? I don't get it.
10093,2020-12-27 21:46:43,kkaa7y,Bummer but that totally tracks
10094,2020-12-27 01:05:01,kkaa7y,I love Josiah. What a lovely person.
10095,2020-12-26 17:59:19,kkaa7y,Gross. Here's another reason why Josiah sucks.
10096,2020-12-28 08:56:24,kkaa7y,Josiah you’re better than this
10097,2020-12-26 03:37:39,kkaa7y,I’ll never understand why people are surprised when characters from this show turn out to be pieces of shit.
10098,2020-12-26 08:08:53,kkaa7y,I’m going to assume this is a joke because if it’s not that’s very disappointing.
10099,2020-12-27 00:24:27,kkaa7y,Thank you!! He’s horrible!
10100,2020-12-28 00:09:38,kkaa7y,"Circa 2006 my friends and I were emo and J Star was friends with a lot of members of emo bands so I always saw him in photos and such. That's really how he got famous on Myspace. The real kicker is that he also has quite a few songs which are pretty shocking. 

If you want a good idea of who he really is listen to Turn Off the Lights by Hollywood Undead featuring Jeffree Star, if you can stomach it. If you haven't heard it before...you will absolutely hate it 😂"
10101,2020-12-26 02:34:56,kkaa7y,very
10102,2020-12-26 02:36:30,kkaa7y,Jeffree being rude actually makes sense to me
10103,2020-12-26 19:03:06,kkaa7y,"Nah, that's exactly who he is."
10104,2020-12-27 17:28:25,kkaa7y,The star on top of the tree is a J* branded mirror.
10105,2020-12-29 10:51:59,kkaa7y,"No, he's not. Just rewatch his season closely and you'll see what a nasty piece of work he is."
10106,2020-12-26 04:45:20,kkaa7y,Because he liked a controversial MUA does that really mean Josiah is a piece of shit? It’s possible he just doesn’t know or isn’t aware of the extent of the situation. It’s also possible he’s not a huge Jeffree Star fan and is just making a joke because he happened to have something on hand. Calling him a piece of shit over this sounds a little extreme
10107,2020-12-26 05:09:04,kkaa7y,Agreed...like think about the type of person who wants to be on reality tv
10108,2020-12-26 05:08:12,kkaa7y,"I don't make generalizations. But having seen the zeal with which Josiah joined Kate in bullying and tormenting Caroline, I am able to have some informed impressions about him."
10109,2020-12-27 00:28:45,kkaa7y,Truly a waste of carbon.
10110,2020-12-27 17:33:43,kkaa7y,Ohhh. Thank you.
10111,2020-12-26 05:41:07,kkaa7y,"Idk, only major j* fans would drop $20+ on one of his mirrors. Unless of course he got it in a mystery box, also bought by stans. And his stans know jeffree's history of being trash. 

ETA I don't think Josiah is a piece of shit but I am disappointed in his support star"
10112,2020-12-26 04:49:25,kkaa7y,Fair. I’ll reserve judgement until I hear more.
10113,2020-12-29 10:52:42,kkaa7y,"Rewatch his season, closely. He is a nasty piece of work."
10114,2020-12-26 18:02:12,kkaa7y,"Josiah is trash. He's sensitive, informed trash as it relates to his own evolution, but he had no problem bullying Caroline, and on numerous occasions he basically watched other people be assholes, with the attitude that the victim deserved it.  He's garbage."
10115,2020-12-26 18:30:05,kkaa7y,"My friend bought me 2 pf SD’s mirrors, which are the same material as JS’s and wow am I disappointed. They fee so cheap and light. Not worth the money. 

The purchase was made right after SD’s merch launched. I use to be a SD fan."
10116,2020-12-28 08:57:00,kkaa7y,He was probably sent one for free
10117,2020-12-26 21:20:20,kkaa7y,"I haven't really followed him beyond the conduct I saw on the show.  I've always liked to think that if he weren't being influenced by Kate's toxicity and Lee's vacant leadership, and perhaps by more constructive people, he would have shown better traits."
10118,2020-12-27 03:34:03,kkaa7y,"I'm not at all surprised they feel cheap. It's such a money grab. Idk if you saw Shane's series on j* but in one of the episodes, jefree bragged about how much money he makes off his products. He is a dick so I'm not surprised he wanted to flex, but I am surprised that he would share that info because it shows how his prices are way beyond anywhere reasonable. If he cared so much about personal relationships, like he pretends when he does his meet and greets, he wouldn't be over charging like he does and more of his fans could actually afford his products. I'm a former SD as well. Him becoming bffs with jefree was kinda the nail in the coffin for me. 
Edited for a plethora of typos"
10119,2020-12-28 13:19:06,kkaa7y,PR? I doubt he is anywhere near popular enough. Maybe if he was kate level of well known but a lot of BD viewers don't even know or remember him.
10120,2020-12-27 03:39:59,kkaa7y,"I had always wanted SD to do a makeup line since he did skits where he would do “makeup tutorials”. I was very blinded by that. JS was a means to an end for me because I never really liked him, he always annoyed me."
10121,2020-12-27 04:27:18,kkaa7y,"Well then I guess in actuality, JS actually did some good by default, there's 2 of us here that walked away from SD after their money grab. (Btw, I bought a bundle and have the mini controversy and conspiracy palletes that I waited in line for 4 hours for in addition to shane's books and pre js merch.) So imagine how many others have cut ties with shane. Shane ended up making money and losing fans while JS made more money"
10122,2020-12-27 04:29:18,kkaa7y,"I have the conspiracy palette and both mini controversy palettes. I really like green 😅

But yeah... hope the money grab was worth it for them. I havent been paying much attention since this summer. But I heard that SD made a video recently and JS never really left."
10123,2020-12-27 10:44:00,kkaa7y,"Dang, both minis? That is dedication right there!
I refuse to watch his video. If anything, I will watch a drama channel video that covers it. But I've held out this long so there's no need to give in now and get into it lol"
10124,2020-12-28 21:38:51,kkaa7y,"What are your thoughts on the Conspiracy palette? It was my first Jeffree Star eyeshadow palette and I was really disappointed at the quality of some of the shadows...  :/ 

I enjoy JS despite the shenanigans, but I'm not forking over any more money on him when Colourpop is both cheaper and better quality."
10125,2020-12-28 22:14:52,kkaa7y,I was most disappointed that there was so much fallout. I have to make sure to tap my brush before applying. I dont have problems with the pigmentation or how long they last. I do use toofaced eye primer though.

10131,2020-12-24 19:48:36,kjkz1t,"I've ordered since they began the JS bags and I thought they were extremely worth it. So I would say YES unless you already have  most of the palettes and such.  

 The year that Blood Sugar came out (in February) was when I got it in the lucky bag order placed the following December. I was shocked they would send something still so desired and so new."
10132,2020-12-24 19:30:13,kjkz1t,I totally think it’s worth it if your just starting to build your collection.
10133,2020-12-24 19:55:07,kjkz1t,I'm planning on getting one too!!
10134,2020-12-24 20:02:01,kjkz1t,"This is the first year they're doing XL for his bags! I got the $75 last year and got a blood sugar one so I considered it well worth! The rest of the stuff I got I sold and made my money back pretty easily. Some extra lucky people got the Conspiracy when it was still VERY VERY hot and in demand, but a lot also got blue blood.

I probably won't buy one again for now since I have majority of what I want from him and don't want to be selling even more haha. I'm curious about the regular beauty bags but considering last year's hauls I think I'll sit out this year since supreme cost me a pretty penny

If you are looking to grow to his collection then I think it's well worth it - shipping is $10 in the US for each bag so keep that in mind too if you're on a strict budget. I forget what Canada shipping is though."
10135,2020-12-25 00:09:15,kjkz1t,"It’s is a random risk, unlike the the mystery boxes (that has a exclusive item, and your guranteed a lipgloss/lipstick. 

The beautilish box is what each warehouse has an overload of.. 

For the ones that got it there’s shipped from Philly, they got blue blood and the anniversary lip set with liquid poppies most ppl already had.  

It’s worth it if u don’t have a lot of Jeffree star items."
10136,2020-12-24 23:31:10,kjkz1t,does anyone know when the lucky bags will be dropping?

10150,2020-12-24 17:04:13,kj1bfx,"I think most people didn’t realize how many *casual* fans he had.  As much as I hate to, I’ll admit that I was one.  I didn’t buy everything, only the products I actually felt that I would enjoy, and I was never someone who watched all of his videos, or engaged with much of his other social media.  The casual fans are all gone, bc we’re able to wash our hands and be done.  The stans are the only ones left, and I think we’ve seen how few and far between they actually are"
10151,2020-12-24 04:02:45,kj1bfx,He shouldn't have bought that house. Everything started going down hill as soon as he did.

I also thought that there would be people who would still buy his stuff if it was good quality, then again, there have been a few launches now with quality issues. It all seems to be compounding"
