2,2020-02-05 16:29:14,ezbfmi,No one guessed pitbull 😒
3,2020-02-05 16:02:32,ezbfmi,"DaBaby as a sub? He will get the Migos circa 2017 bud light spot at 5:00, show up 30 min late, and then rock the field for 30. 

The Daft Punk joke never gets old, but if I’m submitting an actual entry...I’m not wasting a spot on them."
4,2020-02-05 17:40:46,ezbfmi,New Sub Entry: Porterrrrr
5,2020-02-06 09:01:42,ezbfmi,Damn no Gwen Stefani? That’s who I’m really hoping for.
6,2020-02-05 15:54:52,ezbfmi,"damn, I wish i got in on this!!!"
7,2020-02-05 15:56:06,ezbfmi,I bet young thugs on the lineup
8,2020-02-05 16:58:36,ezbfmi,so surprised Galantis or Disclosure didn't make anyone's list here.
9,2020-02-05 17:25:13,ezbfmi,Do people really want to see Lizzo or are they just guessing because she’s popular recently? Her album was good but I really don’t think she’s big enough to headline lolla yet.
10,2020-02-05 15:59:04,ezbfmi,11% of the sub is correct
11,2020-02-05 16:29:46,ezbfmi,u/NikeRafa im disappointed in you
12,2020-02-05 20:38:21,ezbfmi,">The Daft Punk joke never gets old, but if I’m submitting an actual entry...I’m not wasting a spot on them.

I mean it's not like there is an actual prize lol it's just for fun"
13,2020-02-05 17:38:18,ezbfmi,"It’s not a pool of “who do you want to play Lolla”, it’s “who do you think is likely to play Lolla”. Lizzo had a big 2019 and is billed as a headliner at Bonnaroo and Osheaga. It’s pretty likely she ends up on the Lolla lineup and because she is headlining elsewhere, she wouldn’t be anything less than a headliner at Lolla."
14,2020-02-05 18:42:51,ezbfmi,"She had ONE big song in 2019 and she rode that wave. I personally do not see her headlining. maybe a sub spot if that, but definitely not able to put up a good crowd at Grant park stage. Maybe i'll be proved wrong here though."
15,2020-02-06 23:41:05,ezbfmi,I don’t get the hype either but she’s the first woman to be a headliner at Bonnaroo so if we get her there’s no way she’s < Top 8 🤷🏼‍♂️
16,2020-02-05 17:42:14,ezbfmi,"She's big enough to headline Lolla for sure, but I think it only really makes sense if she has an album release between now and then. I saw her at Radio City and it was a FABULOUS show, but really short--she doesn't have enough material to headline a huge venue yet. I don't remember how long the headliners play at Lolla, if it's an hour or so she'd be fine, if it approaches two she'd never be able to do it without another album."
17,2020-02-05 17:53:00,ezbfmi,Most headlines only get 75 minutes tops at Lolla.
18,2020-02-05 11:12:27,ez5eyj,ok and? marina still poor
19,2020-02-05 16:21:15,ez5eyj,marina poor eras bad halsey 9/11
20,2020-02-05 13:51:37,ez4vsb,Lizzo. She's super pretty imo.
21,2020-02-05 06:23:31,ez4vsb,"I’ll take lizzo, hopefully my dick still in one piece afterwards"
22,2020-02-06 06:42:06,ez4vsb,What’s Lizzo?

36,2020-02-05 03:01:16,ez1qt8,Dude lied to anny and them try to gaslight her
37,2020-02-05 01:47:46,ez0zgq,A *Dangerous Woman* clothing line would *sell*.
38,2020-02-05 04:53:30,ez0zgq,"Marina doing a FROOT inspired line would be incredible. That era was so bright and colorful, and the catsuits and hoop skirts that she wore for tour have a lot of possibilities. In this house we pretend the Electra Heart Retro range doesn't exist."
39,2020-02-05 01:39:20,ez0zgq,[Dua Lipa's current partnership with Pepe Jeans is involving her current music somewhat!](https://www.instagram.com/p/B8Gpv1pBauS/?igshid=1q470x657qan7)
40,2020-02-05 01:32:07,ez0zgq,"Wow this is a really cool question. For me:

Katy Perry - clothing line based off of her Teenage Dream era. Essentially just really bright, colorful clothes similar to the ones she wore during her music videos/tours

Britney - clothing line based off of Oops I Did It Again or Self-Titled. It would essentially just be crop tops, low waisted jeans, other iconic trends that Britney pioneered

Xtina - Clothing line based off of Stripped. essentially the same as Britney’s but skankier clothes

Billie - WWAFAWDWG clothing line. Huge oversized clothes that are like what Billie wears

Ariana Grande - a clothing line with her staple clothes, so oversized sweaters, high boots, etc 

Dua Lipa - clothing line based off future nostalgia if she keeps delivering like this. 80s-inspired clothes with a modern twist

Lady Gaga - maybe a toned down version of her looks during the born this way era?

Beyonce - I think her recent ivy park line is a good benchmark of what artists clothing lines should be"
41,2020-02-05 01:20:42,ez0zgq,"I don't know why Gaga hasn't done something like this, like each one of her eras have unique aesthetics to make different lines of clothing"
42,2020-02-05 05:00:29,ez0zgq,"I'd love to see a Reputation line, cause I loved how that merch was more low key and didn't scream ""I LOVE TAYLOR SWIFT"". Plus I love black so I'd love to see more stuff in that Style."
43,2020-02-05 03:24:02,ez0zgq,Taylor Swift Red era
44,2020-02-05 03:10:32,ez0zgq,Rihanna please! The Anti merch was GORGEOUS and she’s already got a foothold in beauty and clothing
45,2020-02-05 04:22:18,ez0zgq,Taylor Swift 1989 please 🥺
46,2020-02-05 04:58:59,ez0zgq,"I would’ve loved a Reputation-inspired clothing line - dark, sleek, but also soft somehow? Perfect. (But also Taylor’s merch hasn’t been that good for a while now :/ and the collab with Stella McCartney hasn’t taken off as much as she wanted I think)

(Then again I’m a broke international fan and shipping alone would cost half my soul)"
47,2020-02-05 04:09:23,ez0zgq,"Allie x cape god.  Who wouldn’t want any of her eras, but this one definitely needs to be sold everywhere so the regulars can get on her level.

Robyn royksopp era.  I love this unique style.

Christine and the queens.  Really any of her stuff is fascinating.  She is really the best dressed.

Janelle.  C’mon you need some of these outfits the past few years if you want to look hot.  You could also go the suit route, but c’mon you need the full line of “make me feel” outfits in your wardrobe.  Impractical maybe.  But if you’re gonna wear pop queen outfits, just go buy that monaewear."
48,2020-02-05 09:51:40,ez0zgq,"Looking through my music library, I'd love to see clothing lines based off of:

* Kesha's *High Road*
* Charli XCX's *Number 1 Angel* / *Pop 2*
* Christina Aguilera's *{Bi\~ΟΠ\~iC}*
* Taylor Swift's *reputation*
* Carly Rae Jepsen's *E•MO•TION*
* Dua Lipa's *Future Nostalgia*
* Madonna's *Madame X*
* Britney Spears' *Blackout*"
49,2020-02-05 01:21:39,ez0zgq,"Jessie J with the ""WYA"" era easily. She served A LOT of creative styles and outfits that era."
50,2020-02-05 14:55:28,ez0zgq,I need a Dirty Computer-era Janelle Monáe clothing line in my life so badly honestly.
51,2020-02-05 22:08:33,ez0zgq,I’m a guy that has never even attempted to touch makeup and I would spend ALL of my savings on Taylor Swift’s Style brand.
52,2020-02-05 03:22:28,ez0zgq,"I’d buy the shit out of a Lana line for any of her eras.

Someone else said Lizzo for Cuz I Love You, and I agree. 

An Ari line for thank u, next would be so cute.

Billie had a merch line inspired by Fall Asleep, but it would be neat if she explored the concept beyond tshirts. 

Florence and the Machine would have a great boho sort of line for Ceremonials (or any of their other albums).

I’m curious to see an El Mal Querer line with all the varied influences it has.

Banks would do something sophisticated and simple at the same time.

I’m both interested and scared to see a Tove Lo line.

This is a neat question. I feel like a lot of people in this sub would do a good job in artist management."

54,2020-02-05 04:49:31,ez0zgq,Allie X's Cape God era is so fucking beautiful - [here's an imgur album for the unacquainted](https://imgur.com/a/VjVrftM)
55,2020-02-05 02:11:57,ez0zgq,Not with Ariana's current creative team. Never forget those [penis stained t-shirts](http://www.mtv.com.au/ariana-grande/news/fans-mock-ariana-grandes-new-tour-merch-that-looks-covered-in-a-blue-penis-stain).
56,2020-02-05 01:56:22,ez0zgq,"I looked at some of the clothes and they're really cute! If I had some money in the bank, I would definitely buy some of the pieces."
57,2020-02-05 08:40:54,ez0zgq,"idk, I’m torn about the Dangerous Woman one. On one hand, that’ll look good. On the other hand, it’s a bit too on the nose to the point that she’d literally be creating clones of herself. The high boots and long sweaters make up HER image, I don’t think having fans dress exactly like her is healthy. It creates the impression that we need to look like her. Inspiration is fine but looking like her cloned twin is another thing. Y’all will drag me for this but it’s true, it’s not healthy to want to look exactly like these pop stars who have millions of dollars to pay for makeup, dieticians, personal trainers, etc."
58,2020-02-05 17:02:35,ez0zgq,Billie does have a clothing line! I think it’s sold at urban outfitters. It’s branded with her name but the stuff is really cool.
59,2020-02-05 02:04:24,ez0zgq,"According to an 2016 Billboard article, [*Gaga will never never have a fashion line because she has real respect for designers*:](https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6882421/lady-gaga-fashion-line-designer)

> ""The thing is, at the end of the day, I have a real respect for fashion designers. It’s the reason I don’t have my own line and the reason I never will. If I ever do anything in fashion, it will always just be as a muse or as an aesthetic... I like to be a part of helping artists find themselves and feel good about who they are."""
60,2020-02-05 13:43:22,ez0zgq,Ugh I still consider that her best era aesthetically. The red lipstick was a big **serve**.
61,2020-02-05 15:02:59,ez0zgq,I was obsessed with the aesthetic of that era when it came out and  now that you remind me of it I’m gonna google it and be obsessed again
62,2020-02-05 04:45:38,ez0zgq,"Allie X needs to release a literal cape as *Cape God* merchandise, if it's tasteful it'll be a game changer."
63,2020-02-06 21:22:06,ez0zgq,I just want the E•MO•TION sweater without having to pay thousands of dollars for the real thing.
64,2020-02-05 09:55:18,ez0zgq,"Yes, a clothing line based off of this would be amazing!

Also, check out the comments below this post:

""\*Fivehead""

 😐  😐  😐"
65,2020-02-05 15:21:37,ez0zgq,"She was clearly trying to hard to be unique. I actually really liked her style most during the My Everything era, and I think it would be easy to re-create."
66,2020-02-06 05:28:40,ez0zgq,that would be called merch
67,2020-02-06 05:47:07,ez0zgq,it’s at zumiez!
68,2020-02-04 22:57:29,eyyov4,"I mean it’s kinda hard to describe without sounding pretentious to someone. But here are my top 3s for certain adjectives

Toxic:

Eminem

BTS

Kanye (I am a huge Kanye fan but dudes really need to chill)

Annoying:

Queen

Beatles

NF

Edit: Kendrick Lamar gotta have the most chill hardcore fanbase. Frank Ocean fans are also toxic as fuck"
69,2020-02-05 00:38:59,eyyov4,"crazy twitter stan accounts, posting fancams under tweets, 'maybe if you stanned xyz, abc wouldn't have died' (these are usually trolls but still), generally kinda toxic. nothing wrong with the artists, it's just fan culture has become increasingly toxic"

74,2020-02-05 02:04:38,eyyov4,Beyoncé fans is a tight knit army that is ready to pounce on anyone even looking at her the wrong way. At this point BEYONCÉ herself can’t control them.

76,2020-02-08 05:47:39,eyyov4,I hate the Queen fans that only listen to Bohemian rhapsody or Under pressure and act like they are a super fan

80,2020-02-05 09:19:05,eyyov4,Are Queen fans generally annoying? I always thought I was annoying regardless of my love of Queen

86,2020-02-05 16:59:34,eyyov4,"Yeah, they are often teens who think they’re better than everyone else because they listened to a Queens greatest hits compilation album and don’t listen to new school music.

96,2020-02-04 17:58:31,eyqfic,"If you look at a photo of one of the worst exploiters on earth and a black singer and your problem lies with the singer, you have a problem.

98,2020-02-04 14:56:50,eyqfic,"Sorry, how do you know anything about her? And has she ever claimed to be anything other than an entertainer? 

Weird. I mean, I could put a picture of almost anyone with the same caption, the rich, and even many poor people around the world, work actively against the interests of humanity. I don’t think an artists who has been around for 3 years has really had a chance to become the global elite, let alone bear the responsibility for the economic situation. Perhaps George W Bush? Obama? trump? Citizens united? The corporate cult?

Maybe this is just anti feminist? You don’t provide any reason why feminists and anticapitalists can’t get along? Is it a Zizek-esque critique?"

Me neither but you can’t just assume stuff like this because of a picture with Bezos. 

Why put that stuff about being a feminist icon in there? Do you want to juxtapose feminism with class struggle and do you want to say feminism works against that or something? I mean I just have to infer that from subtext here and can't know your intentions but I think that idea is bullshit. You can't have true socialism without a good understanding of feminism in my opinion."
102,2020-02-04 15:15:48,eyqfic,I dunno about this one if this was her while track record I'd agree but this feels like a reach
103,2020-02-04 16:17:09,eyqfic,"Bezos has access to the darlings of pop culture because he is wealthy. That's it. This photo is more about him than it is about Lizzo, IMO. The music industry is like any other corporate entity: it picks winners and losers and then controls access in order to extract wealth. She is just working within that system and fulfilling its expectations, part of which means meeting with obscenely rich people so they can pretend to be relatable. If the sum total of your criticism is ""she's being used by the system,"" well, yeah, we all are."

And because you reminded me of the body positivity movement: In my opinion it is kind of hindering as many people get encouraged to do nothing about them getting bigger and bigger. Sure you should be happy in your body, but you should also be healthy. And almost every doctor will tell you that beeing of average weight is healthier than beeing above it. (Just wanted to share my opinion, I myself am quite fat myself and I for an example want to change that and become more sporty)"
110,2020-02-04 17:19:18,eyqfic,I'm afraid I don't know her background. Is it not save to assume she has her own struggles and experiences that would help her understand?
111,2020-02-04 23:27:27,eyqfic,I don’t know about any of that. I just think it’s wise to take pause and maybe not jump to condemning people based on being in a photo with someone. Doubly so when it’s a woman of color being bashed by a very white subculture.
112,2020-02-04 18:47:23,eyqfic,Exactly - even if she doesn't know the causes I'm guessing she's faced at least some of the effects

Cultural appropriation is supposed to be about dominant cultures appropriating from disadvantaged minority cultures. Is that what we really think is happening here?"

156,2020-02-05 01:00:17,eyk8vj,"The definition of cultural approriation has certainly come to include taking bits and pieces of a culture to use for thoughtless aesthetic appeal, and that's definitely what is happening here. Also, two wrongs don't make a right. I think it's problematic when Asians appropriate African American culture and it *equally* problematic when the reverse happens."
157,2020-02-04 19:23:54,eyk8vj,"I wouldn't say Asians enjoying black culture is anti-black.  Obviously, there is some anti-blackness in the Asian community, but that's not really what I was referring to.  I'm talking about Asians who dress black because they like the way it looks.  I think it's okay if Asians adopt black culture and vice versa because we're both minorities.  I don't see what Lizzo is doing as problematic in the same way as, say, Gordan Ramsey using his white face to sell Chinese food and making more money than any Asian owned restaurant selling better food could."

162,2020-02-04 01:37:33,eyhnu1,"Because the liberal controlled media (a loud but small section of the overall media) likes to idolize people that obsess over themselves. Thats a critical answer. Now the real answer is-- political and social views are often like a pendulum or a metronome, they swing to one extreme side, then to the other. In the past people idolized the thin and sleek and (sometimes) unhealthy shape of women and men. Then in recent years, people wanted to speak up for more natural bodies, which I think is wonderful. And that ""natural beauty"" movement has helped me personally because, while I'm not fat, I'm definetly not skinny and ""perfect"". But then, because the pendulum doesnt stop in the middle, there were people who said, ""Hey! Fat and fucking obese is beautiful too!"" So for a while, the media was in the middle with ""natural is beautiful"" but then even more recently, it has gone to the other extreme of ""obese is good"". In addition, they claim that the fat and obese are oppressed, and since everyone loves a good 'overcoming oppression' story, they focused on this idea."

Fat and morbid obesity isn't natural though. Being fat and obese is unnatural and unhealthy. It causes long term disease and obesity shouldn't be praised or promoted as something ""natural."""

Sleeper pick: crumb"
191,2020-02-03 13:47:37,ey7auo,Orville Peck 100%. He's already on his way there. His Jimmy Kimmel performance this week was jaw dropping
192,2020-02-03 18:53:41,ey7auo,"I'd say Joji just based on the sole fact that I think he's crazy underbilled on the poster. His set is going to be stupid packed.

I'd also say Black Pumas, Emotional Oranges, and L'Imperatrice just based on the buzz they're generating from their opening album efforts."

194,2020-02-03 14:30:58,ey7auo,Orville Peck. He's already on that trajectory if you've paid attention to everything he's done.
195,2020-02-03 15:22:26,ey7auo,Orville Peck for sure. He is so good
196,2020-02-03 16:44:50,ey7auo,Orville Peck 100%. Also maybe Girl in Red? but I'm being biased on that one bc that was the type of music I wanted to hear when I was a 16 yr old baby lesbian lol
197,2020-02-03 15:04:56,ey7auo,Roddy Ricch is the next Eillishish sort I think. He’s just blowing up so hard right now. I’ve been to maybe 4 or 5 basketball games since “The Box” came out and they play it sssoooooo much. Dude won a Grammy too. He’s definitely my favorite rapper of that style.

All of this happened less than 12 months ago. She was getting popular but it was her album and ""bad guy"" that really blew her up. At time of booking (and first week of February) she was still pretty mid-level in the pop sphere."

214,2020-02-03 19:32:29,ey7auo,"While i agree with that logic wholeheartedly, I'm very new to his music (loving it so far) and also recall there being widespread surprises in regard to his placement, so feel like (at least stateside) he's yet to really pop in the mainstream consciousness... 

am I way off?"
215,2020-02-04 16:05:33,ey7auo,"You're not. I'm shocked hes not near the back half of the second line. General consensus among people I know is ""I keep hearing his name but I dont know a thing about him.""

If we're comparing to Billie Eilish, I think he slides neatly into that lane of talented artist with mass appeal that's already big in the industry but hasn't made his way front and center yet.

That said, if I'm being honest, I think hes more boring than Billie and his last album was a dud."
216,2020-02-05 17:04:39,ey7auo,"You are way off, he is billed 1st or 2nd line at like 6 major festivals. His music and demographic doesn’t lend the same as Billie and Lizzo, so you will hear about him less (less radio worthy songs) but he is still top echelon popular right now."
217,2020-02-04 17:06:47,ey7auo,"appreciate the added context. i'm quote enjoying his tunes, particularly the new record, but i will readily acknowledge that it took a couple tries and a chance encounter with the right song at the right moment to hook me in. of course, to each their own!"
218,2020-02-03 13:00:13,ey6irc,"I think a lot of it has to do with the message in her songs. Women do that with songs/singers that empower them. It doesn’t have anything to do with anyone’s race. When I was young, everyone was obsessed with Beautiful by Christina Aguilera."

288,2020-03-28 12:56:29,fqamh8,"Cock and ball torture From Wikipedia,  the free encyclopedia at en.wikipedia.org

Cock and ball torture (CBT) is a sexual activity involving application of pain or constriction to the male genitals. This may involve directly painful activities, such as genital piercing, wax play, genital spanking, squeezing, ball-busting, genital flogging, urethral play, tickle torture, erotic electrostimulation or even kicking. The recipient of such activities may receive direct physical pleasure via masochism, or knowledge that the play is pleasing to a sadistic dominant.

Contents: Section 1: In Pornography Section 2: Ball stretcher Section 3: Parachute Section 4: Humbler Section 5: Testicle cuff

Section 1: In pornography

In addition to it’s occasional role in BDSM pornography, Tamakeri (literally Ball kicking) is a separate genre in Japan. One notable actress in tamakeri is Erika Nagai who typically uses her martial arts skills to knee or kick men in the testicles.

Section 2: Ball stretcher A ball stretcher is a sex toy that is fastened around a man in order to elongate the scrotum and provide a feeling of weight pulling the testicles away from the body. While leather stretchers are most common, other models are made of steel rings that are fastened with screws causing additional mildly uncomfortable weight to the wearer. The length of the stretcher may vary from 1-4 inches, and the steel models can weigh as much as five pounds.

Section 3: Parachute

A Parachute is a small collar, usually made from leather, which fastens around the scrotum, and from which weights can be hung. Conical in shape, three or four short chains hanging beneath, to which weights can be attached. Used as part of cock and ball torture within a BDSM relationship, the parachute provides a constant drag, and squeezing effects on the man’s testicles. Moderate weights of 3-5 kg can be suspended, especially during bondage. Smaller weights can be used when the man is free to move, when the swinging effect of the weight can restrict sudden movements, as well as providing a visual stimulus for the dominant partner.

Section 4: Humbler

A humbler is a BDSM physical restraint device used to restrict the movement of a submissive male participant in a BDSM scene. The humbler consists of a testicle cuff device which clamps around the base of the scrotum, mounted in the center of a bar that passes behind the thighs at the base of the buttocks. This forces the wearer to keep his legs forward, as any attempt to to straighten the legs slightly pulls directly on the scrotum, causing from considerable discomfort to extreme pain.

Section 5: Testicle cuff

A testicle cuff is a ring-shaped device around the scrotum between the body and the testicles which when closed does not allow the testicles to slide through it. A common type has two connected cuffs, one around the scrotum and the other around the base of the penis. They are just one of many devices to restrain the male genitalia. A standard padlock may also be locked around the scrotum; without the key it cannot be removed.

Some passive men enjoy the feeling of being ""owned"", while dominant individuals enjoy the sense of ""owning"" their partners. Requiring such a man wear testicle cuffs symbolizes that his sexual organs belong to his partner, who may be either male or female. There is a level of humiliation involved, by which they find sexual arousal. The cuffs may even form part of a sexual fetish of the wearer or his partner.

However, these are extreme uses of testicle cuffs. More conventionally, the device pulls down the testicles and keeps them there during stimulation, which has a number of benefits:

Making the penis appear longer. Pulling the testicles down and away from the base of the penis stretches the skin over the base of the penis and pubic bone, exposing the additional inch or so of penile shaft that is normally hidden from view. Improving sexual arousal. While some men may be aroused by the feeling of being ""owned"", the physical feeling of stretching the ligaments that suspend the testicles has an effect similar to the more common practice of stretching one's legs and pointing the toes. Preventing the testicles from lifting up so far that they become lodged under the skin immediately adjacent to the base of the penis, a condition which can be very uncomfortable, especially if the testicle is then squashed by the slap of skin during thrusting in sexual intercourse. Delaying or intensifying ejaculation by preventing the testicles from rising normally to the ""point of no return"". It is much harder to reach an orgasm."

I remember Blinding Lights falling like 40 spots down or whatever the week after it came out because of all the Christmas songs flooding the charts, but it held on, and 3 months later it keeps peaking to a new spot every week and is almost #1."
402,2020-03-24 16:41:31,fo6ux7,"Oprah’s Bank Account moved up 34 spots, the highest of any song I think. Let’s see if it rises next week with a new Weeknd album."
403,2020-03-24 17:41:21,fo6ux7,"Weeknd has like 5 #1 songs on After Hours, hope he gets all of them."
404,2020-03-24 16:02:12,fo6ux7,"How many more weeks do y'all see Post and Roddy sticking in the top ten of the BB 200? B&B and Stoney both did 36-38.

Also I hope Circles breaks the record for longest top ten. Such a good song, deserves it way more than Shape Of You and Girls Like You."
405,2020-03-24 17:13:04,fo6ux7,It is so weird to see songs like Rollie and Myron charting
406,2020-03-24 17:43:44,fo6ux7,was hot girl bummer always on the charts or did it rise back up again for some reason?
407,2020-03-24 16:51:29,fo6ux7,"I can't gauge the reception on Oprah's Bank Account. It rose alot, but it had to I guess. Next week gona be interesting."
408,2020-03-24 17:57:43,fo6ux7,"All aboard the Blinding Lights hype train for #1.

Then the week after I'm rooting for Dua. She moved her album to this Friday so I'm hyped. Refuse to listen to the leak but everyone that has think it's every bit as great as hyped. She's really come into her own with this perfect rollout.

Weeknd and Dua back to back is a feast"
409,2020-03-24 17:29:20,fo6ux7,why tf is the frozen 2 soundtrack here
410,2020-03-24 23:06:37,fo6ux7,Yachty watch 2k20 lessgo
411,2020-03-24 21:35:13,fo6ux7,Bruh Uzi whole drop is charting 😳
412,2020-03-25 00:43:06,fo6ux7,"How is OUTWEST not charting anymore, assumed it was in top 20 rn"
413,2020-03-24 15:50:49,fo6ux7,"I haven't been keeping up to date but wow I didn't know Life is Good was charting that high, I remember looking for it like three weeks ago and there was no sign of it."
414,2020-03-24 18:35:14,fo6ux7,Surely this is the most songs by an artist with “lil” in their name to be on the chart at the same time
415,2020-03-24 23:24:50,fo6ux7,Who the fuck is still listening to the box???
416,2020-03-25 16:39:15,fo6ux7,"I wonder how this chart works b/c it is super surprising that ""What's Poppin"" is only 48 considering I see that song everywhere."
417,2020-03-24 19:14:33,fo6ux7,Uzi and Niall dropped the best albums last week imo
418,2020-03-25 01:42:10,fo6ux7,every song in the top 5 is good except for Life is Good lol
419,2020-03-24 16:22:04,fo6ux7,"I feel like blinding lights is special enough to dethrone the box, I wouldn’t mind it."
420,2020-03-24 16:24:26,fo6ux7,kinda crazy how fast all the uzi songs are dropping thru the charts
421,2020-03-24 16:39:29,fo6ux7,Easily will be Number 1. After Hours in general will crush the charts.
422,2020-03-24 20:03:10,fo6ux7,gIRl YoU GOt tHat YUmMy yUM
423,2020-03-24 20:20:42,fo6ux7,tik tok power baby
424,2020-03-24 20:00:44,fo6ux7,I kinda hope it's his highest charting song that's not a feature.
425,2020-03-25 00:52:42,fo6ux7,People really think that song is good?
426,2020-03-24 17:52:35,fo6ux7,Blinding Lights is Def gonna go number one then hopefully In Your Eyes gets it next. It's a far shot but I could also see Save Your Tears getting it next.
427,2020-03-24 16:17:16,fo6ux7,"Circles is bland, and this is coming from a Post fan."
428,2020-03-25 02:26:06,fo6ux7,Circles is a top 5 worst Post Malone song OAT
429,2020-03-24 17:59:39,fo6ux7,"I never thought I'd see it, these songs finally dropping

If Rollie was mixed correctly from the start and didn't have to compete with The Weeknd I wonder how it would do"
430,2020-03-24 19:12:24,fo6ux7,anytime I happen to hear the radio for a lil while I feel like I hear it.. I think it's been consistently around the middle of the chart
431,2020-03-24 19:12:23,fo6ux7,It's a terrific pop track that's been creeping up since it dropped. I hope it cracks the top 10
432,2020-03-24 17:42:19,fo6ux7,I think relatively it's not a flop but not a big hit either. Two huge stars on it and it's still lower than No Guidance which came out almost a year ago (June 2019)
433,2020-03-24 17:17:00,fo6ux7,"True but don’t forget a lot of Weeknd songs will chart, so 2 weeks from now may be a better representation of how the song ia doing."
434,2020-03-24 18:15:59,fo6ux7,what producers she wrk with on her new project? def want her over some more Calvin Harris or Diplo material
435,2020-03-24 18:00:55,fo6ux7,shit slaps
436,2020-03-25 14:42:09,fo6ux7,Disney+ released the movie on their service three months earlier because of the coronavirus outbreak. This is the main reason the movie's soundtrack rose by 8 spots to #10 this week.
437,2020-03-24 15:54:08,fo6ux7,It was number two for its first eight weeks.
438,2020-03-24 17:29:24,fo6ux7,the Drake verse on it is terrific
439,2020-03-24 23:38:13,fo6ux7,"Same, I knew that it debuted high but damn"
440,2020-03-24 19:01:33,fo6ux7,Think it's got to be. There's 29. The week after Tha Carter V had 28 though. Doubt any other week is close
441,2020-03-24 23:41:06,fo6ux7,"Me, shit still slaps"
442,2020-03-25 00:58:56,fo6ux7,Me
443,2020-03-26 15:30:25,fo6ux7,Yeah man that sht is trash. Only autists in tiktok are listening to it
444,2020-03-24 16:38:11,fo6ux7,"I mean right now for Apple Music top 100 global, the box is 3rd and all the other top 10 is After Hours songs."
445,2020-03-24 16:58:37,fo6ux7,"That's what always happens when a big artist drops and like every song from their album debuts on the Hot 100. They all fall and only the singles/biggest songs remain. 

It's unreasonable to expect 18 album cuts to stay peaking on here after the first week. Literally nobody does that.

Edit: it happened to Drake, Kanye, Lil Baby, Travis, Tyler, J. Cole, Eminem, DaBaby, X, etc etc"
446,2020-03-24 18:15:11,fo6ux7,Idk none of them really feel like they have hit potential
447,2020-03-24 16:32:55,fo6ux7,Cause nobody actaullys cares about them mid ass projects he dropped they only charted cause of hype
448,2020-03-24 21:07:27,fo6ux7,it's doing really great on streaming I'm sure it's mainly that

452,2020-03-24 18:16:23,fo6ux7,I think its one of his best songs
453,2020-03-24 16:18:44,fo6ux7,IDC if it's bland it's one of his best songs
454,2020-03-24 23:08:07,fo6ux7,"I love it, top 5 post songs for me."
455,2020-03-24 16:38:39,fo6ux7,Read the question idiot.
456,2020-03-25 02:36:14,fo6ux7, Nice troll
457,2020-03-25 04:13:06,fo6ux7,Based
458,2020-03-25 16:37:35,fo6ux7,blackbear deserves it
459,2020-03-24 22:03:23,fo6ux7,If it maintains until LB3 comes out it might have real summer hit potential
460,2020-03-24 18:23:59,fo6ux7,"Not sure, but the beats have been really groovy. I definitely want to hear more of her over Calvin Harris. But the 3 singles have all been amazing. All have like an 80s groove combined with modern elements"
461,2020-03-24 23:06:27,fo6ux7,this but unironically
462,2020-03-24 16:07:42,fo6ux7,I'm a blind cunt
463,2020-03-24 18:01:09,fo6ux7,Also Future's flow on that was really good
464,2020-03-24 18:02:36,fo6ux7,but at the minimum those artists keep a song in the top 10/20 for a while.  Doesn't look like Uzi's gonna be able to do that for more than a few weeks... which is honestly embarrassing when you're an artist as big as Uzi and you drop 32 tracks. At least  a few should have popped off
465,2020-03-24 16:36:23,fo6ux7,It’s more that Uzi is rarely chart friendly song wise.
466,2020-03-24 16:37:21,fo6ux7,Ehh I listen to it everyday lol I got about 10 tracks out of both versions combined that I really fw.  If you ask me that drake and future song is super mid yet is top 10.  If they stay in top 100 and his streams above 40k every week then people definitely fuck with it.
467,2020-03-24 16:45:07,fo6ux7,"It's moreso because he's not a singles artist, and his songs don't get a lot of radio play"
468,2020-03-24 16:52:14,fo6ux7,LIR2 didn’t have a song in the Top 10 unless you count XO Tour Llif3.
469,2020-03-24 17:58:19,fo6ux7,Nah I care about them
470,2020-03-24 21:28:17,fo6ux7,yeah but its because it got popular on tik tok it got a second wind
471,2020-03-25 01:51:13,fo6ux7,"Yeah I get it, but this song blows lmao"
472,2020-03-25 16:36:41,fo6ux7,"facts, only reason why he is even relevant is b/c of quality control. smh both designer and fetty were better but they somehow fell off before yachty did, yachty has not had a decent song since lil boat"
473,2020-03-24 21:40:40,fo6ux7,not even top 10 for him
474,2020-03-24 19:58:44,fo6ux7,huh
475,2020-03-24 17:01:31,fo6ux7,Read the bottom idiot.
476,2020-03-25 05:01:41,fo6ux7,Really isn't. It's such a generic and boring song to me.
477,2020-03-24 20:22:17,fo6ux7,Really? I didn't think there was anything notable about it. I thought futures part on that was pretty bland compared to what he's capable of
478,2020-03-24 18:20:33,fo6ux7,What are U even talking about? This shit happens for like 90% of album releases. Usually only the big singles stick behind
479,2020-03-24 23:49:30,fo6ux7,"P2 is gaining in streams, even though it didn't start in the top 10, it might get back up there in a while or if nothing else hang around somewhere in the charts for a while"

481,2020-03-24 18:36:41,fo6ux7,They probably fell harder tho because uzi released a bunch of new songs so uzi fans streamed those more in place of the EA songs
482,2020-03-24 18:38:26,fo6ux7,Lil baby Wayne Ye Da baby Tyler and Em didn’t keep a song in the top 10 for a while
483,2020-03-25 01:56:56,fo6ux7,"really don't think going #1 for 2 weeks straight and selling 500k+ from streaming alone over 2 weeks is even close to ""embarrassing"" but go off"
484,2020-03-24 18:12:44,fo6ux7,"or it means that everyone is enjoying all of the songs equally instead of all crowding to one, which imo is even more impressive"
485,2020-03-24 17:40:19,fo6ux7,it's more that deep cuts don't stay on the charts. The singles do
486,2020-03-24 17:59:36,fo6ux7,"his old music was, it's just the latest stuff just isn't good enough honestly"

489,2020-03-25 04:16:46,fo6ux7,"Blinding Lights is definitely not a Tik Tok song. Actually I don’t think I’ve ever seen a Tik Tok with it as a sound.

Edit: I just looked and there’s only 240k blinding Lights sounds on Tik Tok. For comparison, Don’t Start Now(Number 3 on Billboard) has over 4.5 million sounds"
490,2020-03-25 08:00:29,fo6ux7,Blinding lights is never on tiktok lol. It's a radio song
491,2020-03-25 00:59:45,fo6ux7,What’s your top 10
492,2020-03-25 12:50:46,fo6ux7,Alright to each their own I guess. Idk how people can call this generic there's literally nothing that sounds like it
493,2020-03-24 21:30:31,fo6ux7,Future got the best part of the song
494,2020-03-24 19:08:51,fo6ux7,that's his point...there are no big singles sticking rn
495,2020-03-24 18:22:19,fo6ux7,"Didn't happen with Scorpion which had many tracks become hits that weren't singles at the time of album drop. Didn't happen with Astroworld either. Top artists generally always have at least 1 track from the album release go big. Only exception is when the album has no standout tracks which is basically the case with those 2 Uzi drops

&#x200B;

Even The Box wasn't a single until AFTER it became hot. Generally what happens is people realise what the good songs are and they get more streams than the rest of the project. Literally what's happening with In Your Eyes on After Hours rn... so much so that they've just made it a single after seeing how popular it is"
496,2020-03-25 01:49:47,fo6ux7,Why are you only thinking short term tho?  successful albums nowadays are those with long term success.  Luv Is Rage 2 has sold over 2million because it had multiple big hits.. this album doesn't look like it has potential to hit 2m at all rn because there's nothing really popping off. Of course there's still potential for a few tracks to pop off with some good marketing but I don't see it happening tbh
497,2020-03-24 18:41:10,fo6ux7,"so do you think songs from the 2nd project will stick up higher then?

&#x200B;

I don't think so because from what I've seen stans aren't how songs stay up high in charts. It's the regular casual listeners that keep songs up high.  I bet a very small % of people who've listened to The Box over 10 times have listened to that full album front to back.. Same with Say So by Doja Cat and even Intentions by Justin Bieber.  Even Blinding Lights by The Weeknd (tho to a lesser extent)"
498,2020-03-24 18:45:13,fo6ux7,"You sure Da Baby didn't? tbh all of those projects have basically failed at what they were tryna do except Tyler. Especially Lil Wayne's, jesus his has flopped really badly"
499,2020-03-24 18:20:05,fo6ux7,"Not really how it works though. When a single pops off it will be listened to by a much bigger audience than the album had, if that makes sense."
500,2020-03-24 18:03:55,fo6ux7,an artist as big as Uzi should have at least a few natural hits from a 32 track project tho surely... not doing that is just failure
501,2020-03-24 18:49:27,fo6ux7,"Idk man I really thought Baby Pluto, P2, Silly Watch, That Way, etc. could’ve at least been top 5 or something."
502,2020-03-25 17:45:00,fo6ux7,If he didn’t stray so much from traditional structure (especially hooks) I would agree with you. But his sound and lack of hooks hurts his chart friendliness.
503,2020-03-25 13:59:46,fo6ux7,[deleted]
504,2020-03-25 06:23:51,fo6ux7,"Nah I had this argument before with someone.

This album was delayed a long ass time plus it had several leaks.

Reading the release thread and general consensus: everyone has different ""favorite tracks"" similar to maybe kanye releases recently and many were begging for the sk gs on deluxe.

So my 20 out of 32 tracks and someone else's 20 out of 32 tracks might be completely different depending on the style someone prefers.

Point being that uzi pretty much released this for the fans and for the numbers.  It was a win-win plus I mean if just doesnt release the songs for another 2 years you get the following:

Potential leaks

Outdated sound

Not released at all and not getting paid for it

Another over-saturated album or he doesnt make much new music because hes sitting on too much old music. 

You see what I'm getting at?   MID is what I would call culture 2 (actually that's trash imo) or maybe drake's scorpion album or kanye's ye album (due to hype) but I give a pass to uzi for this album because he was sitting on a shitload of music."

 I could understand his point if a month has passed. But uzi literally just put out the deluxe last week"

I'm not sure how this is ""embarrassing"" when this happens to literally every big artist. When a project drops the majority of songs drop in the first few weeks"
509,2020-03-24 18:28:01,fo6ux7,"True but with other artists the same thing happens, all song fall for 1-3 weeks and then one or two non single songs pop off and start rising again"

Definitely like his poppier cuts more. Also I think B&B>>Hollywood’s Bleeding>>>>>Stoney.

Stoney’s production doesn’t match up at all and the lyrics dont come close either although lyrics don’t really matter much to me. The melodies and hooks don’t come anywhere close to his later albums and the melodies are easily the best part about his music. Plus just not as consistent."
511,2020-03-24 20:49:56,fo6ux7,ehh yeah but the album with the HUGE hype came out 2 weeks ago and I don't hear anyone talking about any one track.. nothing's really HITTING
512,2020-03-26 12:48:55,fo6ux7,"You don't need radio play to have a hit lmao it's 2020.  

Sauce It Up 218m streams  

The Way Life Goes 388m streams  

Dark Queen 152m streams  

XO Tour Llif3 1.2billion streams  

20 Min 165m streams 

&#x200B;

on JUST Spotify.  That makes all those tracks at least like 3x+ plat. Eternal Atake definitely wont have a hit anywhere near as big as XO Tour Llif3 and I don't think it's gonna have one as big as The Way Life Goes even..  The highest streamed song/day on it rn is P2 and that's 17th on Spotify Daily..."
513,2020-03-24 20:15:28,fo6ux7,Fr this shit is a non-argument
514,2020-03-24 21:10:37,fo6ux7,"That isn't really true in the streaming era.. a lot of the biggest hits in the last few years werent' even singles or had no push behind them until after they blew up. XO Tour Llif3 was put on a throwaway project by Uzi and they only made it into a proper thing after it started getting a lot of traction on Soundcloud...

&#x200B;

Same with Astroworld & Sicko Mode. Wasn't a single but it blew up from Day 1 because it was genuinely a very good song. Even The Box by Roddy wasn't a single, it came out the same day the album did and it wasn't a single until like 2 months AFTER the album came out lol

&#x200B;

This doesn't happen to every big artist whatsoever. I can name many examples of random songs releasing on albums by big artists and blowing up within the first few days. Sicko Mode, In My Feelings, Nonstop,  EARFQUAKE etc are just a few examples.. and off After Hours it's clear In Your Eyes is gonna be a hit, they've just made it a single aswell it seems"
515,2020-03-29 23:30:45,fo6ux7,neither of you having anything from August 26th is an absolute travesty...Monte and 40 Funk are both top tier Post songs imo.
516,2020-03-25 11:06:19,fo6ux7,That's because it's ALL hitting. People don't just recycle the same 1 hit. Most of the songs are getting replayed.
517,2020-03-24 21:01:08,fo6ux7,"Well that's a subjective point. I've heard people talking kobe, myron, come this way, lotus, because they have anticipated them for years now. I only have been hearing people talk about uzi new album/deluxe and the weeknd's new album"

But they are too ""hip hop"" or the sound can blend with other tracks, maybe Futsal Shuffle 2020, but that song fell off pretty quickly on the charts.  As i said, not enough replayability or catchiness."
520,2020-03-24 23:58:42,fo6ux7,just because your buddy Al is talking about the tracks doesn't mean they're big singles..
521,2020-03-30 12:37:52,fo6ux7,"cause hits generally don't come out of thin air.. unless you add extra tracks like he did today, which could make a huge difference if 1/2 of them become a hit.  You don't need to wait a year when hits is how albums get like 90%+ of their sales tbh

&#x200B;

seems I was pretty right about Uzi tbh, none of his songs are doing well at all. His highest on Spotify US Daily is 28th!! with only 2 tracks in the top 50.. the project only came out  a month ago, that's so awful.  Imagine you're an artist as big as Uzi and you drop your first album in almost 3 years and fucking Lil Mosey releases a hit that out performs every track on your album.. that's a yikes

&#x200B;

Weeknd has Blinding Lights which started doing well when the album dropped but except from that he has basically nothing still even tho he's tried... so it looks like this album isn't gonna do as well as Starboy long term"

I think we're setting a dangerous precedent here.

At the end of the day, Lizzo didn't write this song by herself and the people she's suing have a bit claim on a lot of the lyrics and the line from that song that is the most well-known is still not her invention and I think to try and screw these guys out of the original ownership of the demo and the overall songwriting credits is a pretty lousy thing to do.

Also, that is literally how it works, same with sampling. This is the whole reason that copyright law exists, so shit like this doesn't fucking happen.

Lizzo has come off so badly in this whole thing. First she didn't credit the woman who's tweet inspired the aforementioned line and now she's trying to screw the original copyright holders out of their credits because the demo is supposedly different."

**Description:** [I’m going to link this interview with Fatima Al Qadiri where she talks about the meaning, background, and composition of this album](https://www.thefader.com/2017/10/12/fatima-al-qadiri-interview-shaneera) because it’s very fascinating, but the abbreviated version is this: The EP takes its title from an Arabic slang term for a gender defying “evil queen,” though “evil” is a bit pejorative in this case. Al Qadiri notes that there’s no direct English translation of the term, but from my understanding it’s similar to Western conceptions of “fierceness” or being a “bad bitch.” A Shaneera terrorizes the gender binary, too loud to be contained, too sexual to be stopped, and that’s the spirit that Al Qadiri captures through energetic electronic music. An intoxicating blend of Arabic and Western electronic styles (with a dash of video game music thrown in), these are hot and heavy dance floor anthems that capture the wicked, mischievous spirit she’s going for perfectly. Voices shout at you from within the haze of music like they’re a final boss taunting you (or perhaps seducing you) as the bass hammers and synth melodies curl around your ankles. It’s a campy, chaotic, *cinematic* experience.

**Positives:** Bold electronic music, queer themes

**Potential Barriers:** It’s in multiple dialects of Arabic

> **Sample Track:** [“Spiral”](https://youtu.be/3DDhvdAwJMw) got a (mildly NSFW) music video

> [**”Lost Wild”** by **WALK THE MOON**](https://youtu.be/TmLvOXIPNu8)

When I first heard *What If Nothing* (a criminally underrated album) I instantly pegged that this song would be a huge hit. I was wrong, of course, but I stand by the sentiment. This is the slickest foot stomper WALK THE MOON have put out since “Shut Up And Dance” and if there were any justice it would have received at least a fraction of that same success. WALK THE MOON are a true *band*, and every member is firing off on all cylinders here. Every part of this track is just so damn good; the drums, the guitars, the bassline, the synths, any one element could easily carry another song on its back but they stuck them all into the same track and the result is sheer euphoria. This song makes you feel like you’re galloping through the wilderness without a care in the world, just you and the music getting lost in the wild."

652,2020-04-21 15:51:59,g5guvy,"Black and White is the best song from Heartbreak Weather and I'm glad it's getting the single push because it fucking deserves it. Stream it lads. 

I think [musicmap](https://musicmap.info) might be one of my favourite websites on the internet, looking at it is so satisfying and layout and formatting is so nice to use. I'm not entirely sure how accurate it is since I'm not a music historian but I think it's an accessible entry point for people wanting to learn more about music history and has helped me discover a few ""niche"" sub-genres that I've really enjoyed. 

I've been on a super explorative music listening mood this past week. Listening to mostly new stuff by new favourite listening experience might be the German Krautrock band Can and their first two releases which are both significantly more enjoyable than I could've imagined coming into them. Willie Nelson and Terry Allen have been on rotation as I've been thoroughly enjoyed their most revered album. Truckload of Art is a really funny song and The Wolfman of Del Rio is honestly touching me especially given how much stress this whole situation is.

Spectrum Pulse reminded me yesterday that Night Changes by 1D exists and it hit me that it's been over 5 years since this came out and that doesn't feel entirely real"

Awkward and outdated jokes aside I like it. think that one of the biggest ""lessons"" or whatever it shows is how good Eric has it with his parents but he doesn't realize it. Yea, Red is hard on him but its not like all his friends parents, who are straight up abandoning them or are corrupt corporate businessmen. He has it good and he doesn't realize it. It'll be interesting to see where it goes."

657,2020-04-21 20:50:21,g5guvy,"is this a safe space? can i say that I found Joker to be WILDLY overrated? 

i’m not even trying to be a contrarian because I would love to have enjoyed it as much as the GP did plus I’m a fan of Joaquin Phoenix but ... I just couldn’t. 

I disliked how crass and blatant the sociopolitical commentary was and I didn’t particularly empathize with the protagonist and it felt like some big event was missing in the movie. there’s a certain depth to it missing

Now Parasite on the other hand... yeah that’s a masterpiece AND a cultural reset"

THEN he got mad at Kelz for flirting with Francesca even though she clearly hated him, and he said Kelz was a “bad friend” for making a move on someone he clearly felt like he had ownership of. THEN Francesca came crawling back to him, despite her not doing anything wrong (to Harry, at least) and then he said that HE doesn’t know if HE can forgive HER for moving on after HE EMBARRASSED HER AND MADE PEOPLE HATE HER. how the fuck did she end up trying to apologize to him, and what a fucking asshole for acting as though he doesn’t still like her.!< it’s been a looooong time since I’ve seen behavior so shameless and nasty as this."

I feel like I can’t just dive right into the album. I’m afraid I won’t *get it*. I’m afraid I won’t have the right context of its place in Fiona’s discography, her life story or culture as a whole. That Pitchfork 10 is a big deal, and I’m afraid I’ll be caught up by the album being praised to the high heavens by every music fan to really know what my own true opinion on it will be.

So much for going and having a ""girls night"" and symbolically letting go of the old sad shit I've been dealing with. Now I'll be worried about my car's windshield not getting smashed in, and probably won't even go anymore but will still have to worry.

i decided to dive into my 1000+ album queue ive had building over the years on spotify, itunes, & rym and organize them all into lists by year to make it easier to sort through. maybe do a “most recommended/excited to listen to” list on top of that to narrow it down some. since it looks like new releases will slow down for a while its the perfect time to dive into the past, i guess. i doubt i will make a dent or ever complete the queue but it makes me feel like im accomplishing something right now"

Feel this. It's weird because it's not like a made for TV feel where you know it will be a certain way. I don't really know how to describe it either and fake seems like a good way to put it. Almost like some of them should be movies within a movie and not real.

I'm 24 right now and last year I noticed some pretty severe balding in the back of my head, most likely due to stress because none of the men on either side of my family are bald. I went to a dermatologist, got prescribed some minoxidil and it worked very well, the balding spot closed up again pretty fast. I'm not sure if you're already looking into that nor if you'd be at all interested, but since you're so young and since it's so early on there are definitely ways to reverse that process before it gets more dramatic."

I've seen the same said about When the Pawn, though. Chronologically will probably help you most understand the context of the album, but I don't think it's necessarily to listen to everything just to enjoy Bolt Cutters."

Also there is a huge difference between being oppressed (which Taylor doesn't even claim she is) and experiencing the sexist bullshit in the music industry and double standards from men on the internet.

Also I thought even the dumbest of reddit users would have clued onto the fact that the narrative of Taylor having boyfriends just to write songs after they break up was over since she's been in a relationship for like more than 3 years now.

Also Also, Taylor has written many excellent songs about not breaking up or beak up songs where she takes the blame (Back To December anyone)

Look at Ariana, when Mac died and she wrote one single song about it they accused her of milking a very personal tragedy.  It is just bullshit.  Also for one Taylor is a great songwriter, and she even admits mistakes as someone below said.  Also, songs like Soon You'll get better and a multitude of different songs like the best day.  Like newsflash to the people who say things about that art is supposed to be a representation of our experiences. That's what makes the best art."

I think one difference is that Taylor was always pretty obvious about who she was talking about. Like she literally named a song ""Dear John"", and people knew she had dated John Mayer. I'm not a big Ed Sheeran fan, so maybe his inspirations are equally obvious, but I think people find it a little more catty when the song is so pointed like that. Kind of like Little Mix's ""Shout Out to My Ex"", when Perrie sings about faking orgasms - it seemed like a direct jab at Zayn, and a lot of people thought that was tacky and mean."

835,2020-04-21 18:28:24,g5guvy,"They’re not condoning The Weeknd getting away from widespread public criticism; they’re just explaining why he’s not being as targeted as Liam, and they’re absolutely right."
836,2020-04-21 15:46:25,g5guvy,"i mean, not really. there have been many other pandemics before and have you been in quarantine wearing a face mask for your entire life? the probability of the entire population having to be quarantined for the rest of eternity is so unlikely lmao. imagine if in a hundred years the entire world was still quarantined for coronavirus."
837,2020-04-21 15:39:43,g5guvy,"I really don't think it is, I think *worst case* culture in the west will take after existing culture in Asia as far as it being common practice to wear face masks when you are sick.

But Americans are very very resistant to change and I think it's far more likely that we won't adopt even the previous behaviors of Asian cultures.

This is of course in a post-COVID-vaccine world"
838,2020-04-21 23:27:57,g5guvy,But her job is literally making music. If you got laid off as a waiter then I wouldn’t expect you to be “productive” because it wouldn’t be your priority. Charli’s job is making music and being creative lol
839,2020-04-21 16:21:06,g5guvy,"It's less of a you thing and more of a sub thing, over the past couple of days/weeks people keep bringing in links from over there and I just do not get it ????"
840,2020-04-21 19:16:15,g5guvy,Well in some of his earlier ones it was harder. But we know Don't is about Elle Goulding if I am correct. Also one of his earlier songs Nina was obvious about his ex  Nina Nesbitt.
841,2020-04-22 01:59:20,g5guvy,Was that the Usher performance from this year's Grammys?  I thought it was lazy to re-air that.
842,2020-04-21 18:40:14,g5guvy,yup got it.
843,2020-04-21 15:48:06,g5guvy,I never said quarantined.

845,2020-04-21 19:20:02,g5guvy,"> earlier songs Nina was obvious about his ex Nina Nesbitt

Yeah, that's pretty blatant (although at least it doesn't seem to be a mean song insulting her). But while everyone pretty much accepts that ""Don't"" is about EG, has he actually said anything to confirm it?

Idk, I guess for me Ed isn't a good example anyways, because it does seem like he gets some shit for the kind of songs he writes."
846,2020-04-22 02:06:02,g5guvy,"Yeah, but I guess showing it at the Grammys was supposed to hype this show 🤷🏻‍♂️"
847,2020-04-21 16:56:13,g5guvy,"yes you did, the person you replied to said : *""no, for the entire rest of history we are going to have to wear face masks and be in quarantine.""* and you said *""It’s literally a possibility.""* not specifying which part you were replying to, so yes, yes you did say quarantine"
848,2020-04-21 16:58:23,g5guvy,Be the change in the world you wish to see
849,2020-04-21 19:36:53,g5guvy,"Yeah, here is maybe how I should reframe it, a lot of Ed's songs are about relationships but I don't think its fair Taylor or any female artist get flack about the writing in the same subject matter. IMO"
850,2020-04-21 17:12:40,g5guvy,"No, I said face masks and no public gatherings."
851,2020-04-21 17:54:04,g5guvy,There’s one already [​r/unpopularopinioncirclejerk](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion)
852,2020-04-21 19:49:00,g5guvy,"I definitely think she got more criticism than she should've. And maybe I'm more irritated with her fans than her (I find it weird to ""choose sides"" when a celebrity couple breaks up, for example). But I guess it does feel like she leveraged her relationships to boost her career (like when Selena talks about Justin). People knew so much about her relationship drama early on, which probably helped her develop a rabid fan base, but it also caused a lot of people to get annoyed."
853,2020-04-21 18:20:37,g5guvy,"Not only are people are going out in public even with the pandemic, but public gatherings have existed since we came down from the trees and thought it was a jolly good idea to band together. You might see a *few* people with face masks, but mass public gatherings will be back up as if nothing had happened within a year of the pandemic ending."
854,2020-04-21 21:55:24,g5guvy,"Oh yeah, I think that it is crazy to make people choose sides. I think that it is interesting to hear their opinions on the songs written about them because I know Harry said they were amazing or something like that. I do think that there sometimes where anyone can go too far though like for Selena as much as I enjoy some of her music (rare was not my fav as an album) I think I wanted to see more about her health struggles and more personal and not just her relationship problems with Justin which at the time were dated."

856,2020-04-21 14:20:40,g5fyaf,I thought The Strokes were never going to get another song in this game. 2020 is full of surprises.
857,2020-04-21 14:24:47,g5fyaf,"I'm so excited for more from The Strokes, their new album The New Abnormal is good, you should check it out if you haven't!"
858,2020-04-21 14:15:27,g5fyaf,"Pretty cool week, we can finally play a 3-song setlist by The Strokes :D"
859,2020-04-21 14:15:34,g5fyaf,"....Oh my god. I didn't think Harmonix was going to continue this rare DLC-buying streak, but we're now on three straight weeks of me buying at least one song. Lizzo's ""Juice"" is a fantastic addition; feels a little late to get it truthfully, but I'm not complaining. One of those rare songs that would work perfectly at a Rock Band party, but also would be fun to play outside of that context. Instant buy!

I haven't heard anything from the new Strokes album but I guess this song is basically Dancing with Myself? They're a band that desperately needs more in the game regardless. Somehow this is only their third song in Rock Band and it's been 8 years since the last one."
860,2020-04-21 14:29:21,g5fyaf,Really excited for more from The Strokes and the Lizzo song is ok.
861,2020-04-21 14:22:38,g5fyaf,"This is an incredible week!! Wow, between the Hayley Williams/Dua Lipa week, the Ra Ra Riot track last week, and now this, I'm absolutely loving this Spotlight Pass Plus. 

The new Strokes album is fantastic, and while ""Bad Decisions"" wouldn't have been my first choice (as we already have ""Dancing With Myself""), I'm just so glad to get anything from it. Can't believe this is the first new Strokes song we get in 8 years, there's so much more we need from them.

Harmonix has been doing great with pop picks this season. As opposed to playing barely-there synth lines with 20-measure breaks in every verse, we're getting tracks with actual guitar and bass, and with fairly active parts at that! ""Juice"" looks as though it'll be a ton of fun to play, and a perfect party track."
862,2020-04-21 19:54:03,g5fyaf,"Awesome! Finally more Strokes, it's been far too long. Honestly, ""Bad Decisions"" is my least favorite on the new record and I'd take at least a dozen other songs by them over this one, but beggars cannot be choosers and I am extremely happy regardless.

We need a pack ASAP!"
863,2020-04-21 14:50:10,g5fyaf,"More Strokes is awesome. I wish we had more of the classics like 12:51 or Last Nite.

865,2020-04-21 18:29:41,g5fyaf,Lizzo's Juice was the jam of 2019.  I can't wait to play it!
866,2020-04-21 20:11:18,g5fyaf,"I don't like Lizzo at all, but that song from The Strokes sounds good. I will buy it and I may buy  Under Cover of Darkness too and another song from the wishlist. I hope for more RBN very soon, though!"
867,2020-04-21 22:12:36,g5fyaf,"Bad Decisions is a decent tune, sure am happy with that one! As for Lizzo I can’t say the same. Not really a fan of Juice sorry Cam. I will gladly skip that song."
868,2020-04-21 20:04:47,g5fyaf,YESSS LIZZO IN ROCK BAND LET'S GO
869,2020-04-21 20:31:13,g5fyaf,Ah yes the Strokes! Been digging bad decisions and the new album so I’m excited for this!
870,2020-04-21 20:39:57,g5fyaf,"Great week! More Strokes is always welcome but I’m pumped for Juice most of all. I’m not sure if this was intentional, but it’s particularly fitting to get this announcement on the anniversary of Prince’s death seeing as Lizzo was a collaborator with and somewhat of a protege of his. And let’s be honest, Juice has tons of Prince-ish touches and I’m excited to play it."
871,2020-04-22 02:58:11,g5fyaf,Not only did they get Lizzo but the right Lizzo song.  Truth Hurts and Good As Hell may have been bigger but Juice is just awesome.
872,2020-04-21 15:31:14,g5fyaf,Damn I don't remember the last time we had The Strokes. Nice week!

875,2020-04-21 14:26:35,g5fyaf,I love Lizzo but they could've picked a few songs over this one and I would've been very much happier. Hopefully we get more from her in the future.
876,2020-04-21 14:45:22,g5fyaf,"Whoa, what a week!"
877,2020-04-21 23:31:16,g5fyaf,Hell yeah! Good week for DLC
878,2020-04-23 02:27:38,g5fyaf,Hell yeah to Lizzo. What a surprise!
879,2020-04-21 14:45:18,g5fyaf,Always dig the Strokes definite buy with the discount. Hard pass on Lizzo
880,2020-04-21 14:46:42,g5fyaf,Pretty fun week. Can’t afford to buy DLC atm but hopefully I’ll get it down the line.

882,2020-04-21 14:19:27,g5fyaf,"Definitely not my taste, but good for people who like it!"
883,2020-04-21 16:23:39,g5fyaf,Can't wait to play Simmer
884,2020-04-21 16:56:31,g5fyaf,Sweet! ...now I need to get my instruments here.
885,2020-04-22 22:57:27,g5fyaf,"Fuck yeah The Strokes! Wouldn't even mind another off this album, let's all buy to show our support."
886,2020-04-24 17:29:30,g5fyaf,"Hey, I'm late to buying these songs for this week and I can't find Juice! What gives?"
887,2020-04-23 10:57:14,g5fyaf,"When will Bad Decisions be in the game?

EDIT: I just bought the game so sorry I don't know how the Spotlight pass works, do you have to buy it to get access to these songs? I can't see it on the store

EDIT: See they are up now! Just had to be patient. Sorry for the dumb question! Happy rocking!"
888,2020-04-28 02:15:05,g5fyaf,"Awesome another The Strokes song! Possibly do a three new Strokes pack from their recent sixth studio album include The Adults Are Talking, At The Door, and Brooklyn Bridge to The Chorus or Forever Summer. Also a St. Vincent Four-pack with Cheerleader, Surgeon, Digital Witness or Los Angelos, and  Cruel after getting Birth in Reverse on The RB4 soundtrack. Also a 2020's song package with Caution by The Killers, Stupid Love by Lady Gaga, Kiss and Tell by Angels and Airwaves, and Blinding Light by The Weeknd. Another Ariana Grande pack. Don't get your hopes up for Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd are likely to give the rights to their songs toward Rocksmith than Rock Band. Rock is not dead. It's been struggling for awhile within the mainstream as pop, R&B, rap/hip-hop, and country dominate the Billboard's top 100 charts. Rock still exists but the mainstream rock is now either bands which are getting irrelevant or terrible new hard rock/metal and older post-grunge/nu-metal. Rarely a good artist like The Strokes or The Killers. There are still a few amazing bands as such as White Reaper, Arctic Monkeys, Cage The Elephant, and Royal Blood.  You can search the web all day to find several new rock bands/artists or older fantastic ones which fit your taste. A pet peeve of my and I think a lot of us is people complaining that rock is dead or there is no new good music from the 21st century rant vids. Also when people say that all rap/hip-hop is the exact same, when clearly Eminem 2Pac Biggie and Post-Melone sound like no one else, and not all rappers talk about suggestive sex/drug lyrics partying and money. Try to search for the clean versions to play in front of your parents/friends would don't enjoy the profanity in those songs."
889,2020-04-21 23:48:08,g5fyaf,Worst pass ever

892,2020-04-24 12:27:49,g5fyaf,"One of these days I’ll have heard of *one* of the songs in the weekly DLC release, hasn’t happened in like four years for me 🤷‍♂️"
893,2020-04-21 14:46:35,g5fyaf,"Agreed! But also give their last album, 2013's Comedown Machine, another shot. I feel it got unwarranted hate, and there are quite a few tracks on that album that would be killer in Rock Band."
894,2020-04-21 14:46:34,g5fyaf,"What are your favorite tracks?

I'm a big Strokes fan and I really wanted to like The New Abnormal but I found it pretty boring from start to finish. I'm hoping I'll find more to like if I focus on the highlights but no songs on there really stood out to me on the first listen."
895,2020-04-25 05:22:25,g5fyaf,Oh boy do I have bad news for you
896,2020-04-25 12:58:27,g5fyaf,"Funny enough, The Strokes gave Billy Idol a co-writing credit on Bad Decisions due to the blatant similarities with Dancing With Myself."
897,2020-04-22 21:27:48,g5fyaf,It's been nearly that long since the Strokes put out a new album.
898,2020-04-21 15:01:24,g5fyaf,"Rocksmith’s Strokes collection was good:

- Under Cover of Darkness (already in RB)

- Reptilia (already in RB twice)

- Last Nite

- Juicebox

- Someday

- 12:51

- You Only Live Once

- Taken For a Fool"
899,2020-04-21 16:41:22,g5fyaf,"Yep. From the HMX blog about this week's releases:  
>  The melody takes after, and is actually credited to, Billy Idol’s “Dancing With Myself.”  
  
It's SO blatant. And the preview pretty much only shows that part, which is kind of a bummer because I already know how Dancing With Myself sounds."
900,2020-04-21 16:02:56,g5fyaf,It is a 100000% rip off of dancing with myself.
901,2020-04-21 15:37:40,g5fyaf,I think Juice is just the most suitable for a game like this. Very 80s electro pop feel to it.
902,2020-04-21 17:52:05,g5fyaf,Juice seems the most fun on all instruments out of her songs. It’s easily one of her most popular ones too
903,2020-04-21 16:25:22,g5fyaf,Agreed-- 'Soulmate' is another song from her new album that I would totally dig.
904,2020-04-21 15:29:52,g5fyaf,Or not.
905,2020-04-27 17:02:00,g5fyaf,"It was pulled from the store for accidentally being uncensored, it'll be back soon."
906,2020-04-25 11:06:11,g5fyaf,"It was pulled, and will be back in a week or two."
907,2020-04-24 12:59:08,g5fyaf,"> hasn’t happened in like four years for me

Sure..."
908,2020-04-21 16:26:43,g5fyaf,Holy shit I didn't realize Comedown Machine came out 7 years ago
909,2020-04-21 15:30:18,g5fyaf,"I'd say my favorites are The Adults Are Talking which sounds the most like the old stuff with the great guitar interplay, Brooklyn Bridge to Chorus which best represents the fun New Wave vibe on this album, and Ode to the Mets which is on the more serious and heart-felt side. But overall, I thought it was consistent and lively without ever getting too indulgent."
910,2020-04-25 22:27:27,g5fyaf,I actually bought Juice before it was pulled lol. My reaction to singing it on vocals for the first time was priceless
911,2020-04-21 15:40:23,g5fyaf,"Yeah, that's a great collection of Strokes tracks! Throw in ""Heart in a Cage"", maybe ""Hard to Explain"", and a couple of *Comedown Machine* tracks, and I think the pre-*TNA* essentials are covered."
912,2020-04-21 15:54:11,g5fyaf,I wish we got you only live once as it’s one of my fav by the strokes
913,2020-04-21 18:03:07,g5fyaf,But it’s not a rip off.  It’s intentional and they even credit Idol on the song
914,2020-04-21 20:36:57,g5fyaf,Also a rip off of an 80s band. I can't think of the name of them but I hear their riff in the verses a lot.
915,2020-04-21 23:10:49,g5fyaf,"I wouldn't use the term rip off as much as inspiration due to admittance of how close it is. Its kind of like how Portugal. the Man credits The Marvelettes on Feel it Still because they realized how close it was to Please Mr. Postman in the chorus. Sometimes writing music you'll make something and love how it sounds but then get crushed that it sounds very close to something you used to listen to so rather than scrap a solid song you just reach out and give them credit.

Rip off id put more in line with people who use something near identical and change just enough to not get sued over it. Or sampling sections of songs where the original artist hates how its used but some dumb loopholes let them use it anyway."
916,2020-04-25 11:06:31,g5fyaf,Ok I will just get it then (it’s on my wish list)
917,2020-04-21 16:32:44,g5fyaf,Started listening to the album but kept Adults Are Talking on repeat that I never got to the rest. I love that song!
918,2020-04-21 16:58:06,g5fyaf,"Yeah, I’m hoping for something like that if the new project uses the existing RS2014 library. Put a song from TNA on the disc and have a DLC pack with those and another song from TNA."
919,2020-04-21 23:34:22,g5fyaf,I didn’t know that. At least they did. A lot of songs lately clearly ripping off older songs and melodies and hardly anyone is aware of it.
920,2020-04-22 15:32:12,g5fyaf,When I was looking stuff up about the song online ([to see how musically similar it really was](http://www.musicologize.com/does-bad-decisions-infringe-on-dancing-with-myself/)) I saw a lot of references to Melt With You by Modern English. Some guy even did a mashup between the 3: https://youtu.be/NLp-UVFwK_A
921,2020-04-21 19:55:52,g5fyaf,"Gotta keep going my dude, the next track, ""Selfless"" is beautiful"

946,2020-04-20 22:28:53,g52892,"Yeah so then we have: Lil Uzi, Young Thug, Kanye, Asap Ferg, Rocky, MadeinTYO, Diddy, Meek Mill, Nipsey, Post Malone, Future, Lizzo, Paak, Jhene. That are a lot of features!"
947,2020-04-21 03:28:45,g52892,Honestly I hope we get a single or something soon. Taking forever!
948,2020-04-21 06:44:39,g52892,I feel like there’s gonna be a surprise Kendrick feature on there
949,2020-04-20 22:34:25,g52892,I hope we get another logic feature tbh

961,2020-04-21 10:57:42,g52892,i think people misheard the lyrics and thought sean said uzi thats why
962,2020-04-21 02:45:01,g50vs4,"Nobody knows who will even be available right now.

Just one of many logistical nightmares facing Roo and pretty much every rescheduled event right now.

This is why I predict cancellation soon.

Still hope not, and those of us who are able get to experience even a diminished Roo in 2020."
963,2020-04-20 23:05:04,g50vs4,Doubt they’ll confirm until there is more certainty that the fest will even occur this year.
964,2020-04-20 23:19:50,g50vs4,I mean with the current climate they can't even confirm bonnaroo is happening. They're not gonna officially announce anything.
965,2020-04-20 20:47:20,g50vs4,There’s a stickied post at the top covering this exact thing
966,2020-04-21 17:33:58,g50vs4,they are too busy working on the cancellation announcement for that
967,2020-04-21 00:18:38,g50vs4,Tickets sold out.  They have their money.  They don't care about servicing us right now.
968,2020-04-21 05:43:37,g50vs4,"Not with any official announcements from Bonnaroo, which is at least part of my point. Shaky Knees rescheduled with confirmation that the headliners had agreed to the new dates. I understand that nothing is certain, but Bonnaroo could tell us if the headliners are game to the new dates if the event proceeds. We only know the info in the September lineup thread from Internet detective work that’s been pieced together by us. Bonnaroo has been silent about the lineup, and we have no confirmations that any of the headliners will be the same."
969,2020-04-21 02:03:29,g50vs4,I would like to be serviced!

971,2020-04-21 11:22:54,g50vs4,"Because they have no idea if it’s actually even happening. It makes no sense to get a lineup together and announce it right now. And bonnaroo employees should be being safe and staying home. Not worrying about us. There are more important things going on. I’m sure once we know it’s going to happen based on when the virus slows down, we will know more details. It’s still 4 months away"
972,2020-04-21 13:15:33,g50vs4,"Bonnaroo must be sending people to this site to downvote any criticism of their lack of information. Other festivals in the same situation have handled the challenges in more consumer-friendly ways. Everyone knows it's not Bonnaroo's fault that the event is at risk, but they have strung consumers along without offering refunds or naming any bands that are on board with the ""tentative"" new dates. These are fair points."
973,2020-04-21 02:04:09,g50vs4,Nice

983,2020-04-20 20:29:29,g4zhof,"Mavi getting 39 votes is criminal, I get that he got so few votes because most people who voted didn't listen to it but I was hoping this would put people on him"

Really hoping it can pull of the upset this round"

1017,2020-04-20 21:12:31,g4zhof,I think it got by on name recognition alone tbh
1018,2020-04-20 23:11:47,g4zhof,The Comet Is Coming was definetly one of the best of the year and I'm very dissapointed it didn't make it past round 1
1019,2020-04-20 23:10:31,g4zhof,"Honestly I think in quality the albums are quite close, but I do prefer Danny's album"
1020,2020-04-21 02:27:46,g4zhof,"I just gave it a listen (didn’t vote on that round) but it just sounds like all the other albums from Earl’s collective. I loved SRS for how fresh it was, but all these guys are sounding the same (superficially, I’m sure) to me."
1021,2020-04-20 21:35:59,g4zhof,honestly people shouldn’t have voted in that round if they didn’t listen to Mavi’s album
1022,2020-04-20 23:13:52,g4zhof,"RIP NGAB, best debut album of the year"

1026,2020-04-21 04:41:54,g4zhof,All 3 are top 10 albums of the year but go off 🤷🏻‍♂️
1027,2020-04-21 01:35:39,g4zhof,It's gonna lose to the AOTY so that's respectable
1028,2020-04-21 11:05:19,g4zhof,i can't imagine solely basing my taste in music off of shitty memes and spending too much time on the internet
1029,2020-04-20 22:27:07,g4zhof,No
1030,2020-04-20 21:18:00,g4zhof,"I think so too, heavily doubt AF would have gotten through if only listeners of both albums voted. Shame, was looking forward to seeing how it would do."
1031,2020-04-20 21:53:08,g4zhof,i say this as the most devout of midwest emo fans and kinsella worshipers: american football LP3 sucked ass.
1032,2020-04-22 03:08:59,g4zhof,"If you don't count his work as Silver Jews, Purple Mountains takes that title easily. Orville Peck - Pony is also really good and I'd take that over NGAB"

1034,2020-04-20 21:45:06,g4zhof,it shouldn't make it over schlagenheim though
1035,2020-04-21 19:08:19,g4zhof,do you really think 1000 gecs defines my entire music taste bc if so you obviously don't know anything lol
1036,2020-04-20 22:27:59,g4zhof,ok pissbaby
1037,2020-04-20 22:39:42,g4zhof,nah they're right.
1038,2020-04-20 22:29:34,g4zhof,"Don't worry, I voted for Schlagenheim."
1039,2020-04-21 03:05:59,g4zhof,they obviously shill for small trucks.
1040,2020-04-20 19:23:41,g4y91v,You’re getting a lot of hate but i like a lot of these takes
1041,2020-04-20 18:41:50,g4y91v,"I won't say it's out of the question we go OL at 33, but it seems unlikely. All offseason our coaches and beat writers have been talking about the improvement in the OL over the last half of the season and basically how they're higher on the unit than most outsiders. Obviously could all be smokescreen but our team affiliated guys are usually on the nose with this stuff."
1042,2020-04-20 19:55:42,g4y91v,"For Tampa, i'd re-draft as:

1.21: Josh Jones, OT

2.45: D'Andre Swift, RB

2.53: Laviska Shenault, WR (bigger need than people think)

3.76: Matt Hennesey, iOL"
1043,2020-04-20 20:14:44,g4y91v,"Regarding the Vikings draft:

Solid round one. I could see them easily going that exact route. Fits our FO mentality, needs, and play styles.

Simpson in round two is bad, and I'm not talking from a value/evaluation standpoint. He does not have the skillset we look for nor need to succeed in our zone blocking system and is not someone we will likely be looking at for that reason, especially that early. Peart/Bartch/Jonah Jackson would have been better fits for OL.

I don't think we'd address CB that early again without addressing some other positions, but if we did, Robertson isn't a bad fit and we've met with him twice (combine and virtually) so there's interest there at the least. But Driscoll is not a good fit for us there. 

You managed to take two OL who would flop in our OL system unfortunately. That's the biggest mistake as the other three make sense from a fit perspective (even though not addressing DT or a second WR would be preferable to a second CB IMO)."
1044,2020-04-20 20:25:49,g4y91v,I don’t hate it for the lions but I wouldn’t be happy at all. I think if gross matos is there in the second we have to take him. We have passed up on edge for too long and Jamie Collins and Zach baun are to similar of players. I think taking a tackle when a interior rusher of gallimore’s potential is there after we just signed big V would be incredibly disappointing. We also need to draft a wide out relatively early and if Bryan Edwards is there at 85 I feel like we would have to take him
1045,2020-04-20 20:35:47,g4y91v,"Really don't like this at all for the Colts. Trading up for Pittman doesn't really make sense, especially when better WRs like Higgins and Aiyuk are still on the board, and Fromm is a big reach at 44. He's got possibly the lowest ceiling of all the QBs in the draft, and that's absolutely not worth spending a mid-2nd round pick on."
1046,2020-04-20 18:26:05,g4y91v,"I’d kill myself if this way the Jags draft. If we’re tanking for a QB, why waste a mid pick on one? Are we really gonna throw away Jawaan Taylor after one year for a worse prospect? Lol"
1047,2020-04-20 18:31:32,g4y91v,It’s hard to tell without it being numbered but it looks like you gave away a ravens second round pick without a trade.
1048,2020-04-20 18:32:37,g4y91v,"I have nothing against Reagor as the pick, I’d like for the Packers to take him, but knowing how that team drafts, I’d be absolutely STUNNED if they left Josh Jones on the board for Reagor at 30, only to reach on a different tackle 2 rounds later.

I know a lot of fan bases think theirs is going to avoid the player with off field concerns, but I can’t remember the last one the Packers drafted. I’d also be very surprised if they went with Gay in the 2nd. I don’t think he’s fit in the locker room with Z, Preston and ARod at all."
1049,2020-04-20 18:33:45,g4y91v,"I don't see Detroit drafting an OT early when they just signed a RT in FA, have Decker at LT, and Crosby as their swing tackle"
1050,2020-04-20 18:36:29,g4y91v,"I think the Pats need more than Kmet with how bad the offense was not just at TE. We currently lack any outside threat at WR and because of that teams just sat the middle of the field while double teaming Edelman and the rest of our guys drowned in man coverage. Pats need a guy with speed to line up outside who teams have to respect. Harry, Edelman, And Sanu aren’t those guys."
1051,2020-04-20 21:18:23,g4y91v,Isn't CJ Henderson the more linked name to Atlanta moving up rather than Kinlaw?
1052,2020-04-20 22:14:44,g4y91v,I don't think that's a reach for K'Von Wallace. Reggie Robinson on the other hand...
1053,2020-04-21 12:50:34,g4y91v,Yesssssssssss
1054,2020-04-21 16:21:25,g4y91v,Good mock for the pack

1056,2020-04-20 18:38:36,g4y91v,4-20 must be great to you
1057,2020-04-20 20:40:26,g4y91v,"No way the Chargers pass on Isaiah Simmons there. Also, A.J. Epenesa is so much better than Player B."
1058,2020-04-20 19:32:01,g4y91v,This is my “not what I would do” but more of a predictive “if the rumors are true” mock.
1059,2020-04-21 03:44:18,g4y91v,I feel you but I would be really happy with Jones.
1060,2020-04-20 20:55:45,g4y91v,Trading up for a WR outside of the top 4 in this class is insanity. We also don’t need another game manager QB. Hate this
1061,2020-04-20 18:41:22,g4y91v,Taylor was pretty good for a rookie starting all 16 games with a trash can with a broken wheel as his guard. I don't know how you could plan on moving him.
1062,2020-04-20 19:03:55,g4y91v,"Just about to comment this, clearly just lazily drafted for jags"
1063,2020-04-20 18:43:47,g4y91v,"Weird, it’s coming through fine on my computer, but not on my phone. Ravens have two 2nd rounders correct? 55 and 60?"
1064,2020-04-20 19:07:16,g4y91v,"The thought being either sit Niang for a year (medical redshirt) and the start him in 2021 when Deckers contract expires, or move him temporarily inside to guard if he is healthy enough."
1065,2020-04-20 19:21:09,g4y91v,"Right lol I don’t expect casual mock drafters to know everything, but when you open up with chastising statements like “if you criticize back it up with some knowledge” then you can’t be making clown picks in your mock without backing it up"
1066,2020-04-20 18:46:57,g4y91v,"Yup, and I was wrong, you got them both. I just couldn't tell. 

Numbers aren't working on either desktop or app."
1067,2020-04-20 19:22:19,g4y91v,“Here’s a safety” not like u had us pick a reach of a DB at nine just because reporters that also know very little say Henderson might go top 10. And Eason too yikes
1068,2020-04-20 19:19:36,g4y91v,Got it fixed. Note to self: don’t copy and paste from Notepad ++
1069,2020-04-20 15:08:28,g4ufrm,"Happy 2 year birthday to No Tears Left To Cry. 

Time isn't real, how has it been 2 whole years already."
1070,2020-04-20 15:17:39,g4ufrm,"I decided to give Soon You’ll Get Better a listen again, just cause I love the song. I let the album continue on into False God, because I really like that song too. I decided to let it keep playing after that too. 

But I completely forgot that You Need To Calm Down comes after False God. I skip it so much, I literally did not remember that the track list doesn’t go straight from False God to Afterglow. And let me tell you, it was not a welcome surprise either. I don’t hate YNTCD, but going from a sex ballad to THAT... it’s jarring as hell. Even more jarring than “my mom has cancer” going into “literal sex ballad”.

1072,2020-04-20 18:02:59,g4ufrm,"Dancing Queen by ABBA is THE perfect pop song. It encompasses everything that is great about pop music in one song.

The beat of Dancing Queen is a grooving, disco beat, that obviously makes you want to move,  coupled with an iconic chord progression that just feels like bliss. Once the beat is established, ABBA makes a bold move by diving right into the chorus, hooking you right away. After giving you this hint, they dial it back to a few verses that that set the scene, transporting you right into the dance floor no matter where you are listening to it. They are sung in a playful, inviting way, gently building tension towards the chorus which you are waiting for. Then the amazing bridge comes, ""But when you get the chance..."" The build-up here is crazy- it asks a question, and the chorus answers it. The chorus of Dancing Queen is just euphoric. Not only is the melody incredible and the harmonized voices sound like, but it has perhaps the most danceable lyrics ever. Not only do they make you want to dance, like many other great pop songs do, they make it feel like *you* *specifically* are the best dancer and on top of the world. And just when you think it can't get any better, they introduce a chord change into the song that brings it to an even higher level. Anyway rant over"

* Even though very little changed besides the voice-over and the ending it just *felt* like such a different movie, you got to spend more mental energy observing the small details of the world, particularly all the ambient sounds. It felt more atmospheric and less neo-noir.

* I live for slow movies where everything was not explained so I was very literally at the edge of my seat all movie compared to laying back and only being 75% engaged with Harrison narrating at me what's going on so literally

* With both of those things said, I fully understand why a voice over was added and think it was probably the correct move from the studio's perspective. Lets be honest, the average moviegoer isn't into slow movies where the ending is ambiguous and the themes aren't explored very literally on the screen, even though I think it makes a better artistic piece without it. It just simply wouldn't have become the cultural phenomenon without the theatrical cut. There was probably a middleground that could have kept both camps happy, but I'm really glad we got the Final Cut for movie fans."

#[*Freedom Highway* by Rhiannon Giddens](https://open.spotify.com/album/1CVuPxNHwY5ORJ8MhjD0UB?si=9GvKe6FmSjuNDJO18mAxeQ)

**Genre/Length:** Country/Americana / 49 Minutes

* **For Fans Of:** Dolly Parton, Elle King, Janet Jackson’s experiments with non-dance genres

**Description:** The same year Rhiannon Giddens released this album she received a MacArthur Genius Grant, and if THAT’S not a co-sign I don’t know what is. She’s a treasure in the country music scene, a great writer with a deep love of the genre who also happens to be a beast of a vocalist. And she really has something to say with her music: *Freedom Highway* is an exploration of the struggles of black people in America. The stories she tells are harsh but presented simply and matter-of-factly, making them feel intensely human rather than melodramatic or preachy. Some of these songs are covers of classics, most of them are original compositions, and you can’t even tell which are which because of how timeless her writing is. These songs are brought to life by rich compositions of thumping percussion and twanging strings that make the perfect backdrop for her haunting voice. While her music is accessible it’s way more on the “country” side of “pop-country,” leaning in to the blues, jug band music, spirituals, gospel, folk ballads, dixieland jazz, and probably more styles that I can’t even name, but there’s also the odd hip-hop/rap track sprinkled in there, blending seamlessly in with the rest of the songs (which, I think, is the point). 

**Positives:** Deep lyricism that explores the history of black people in America, great Americana compositions, good mix of styles

**Potential Barriers:** It’s a genre album, not “pop” country

> **Sample Track:** [“We Could Fly”](https://youtu.be/Q6fAD90KXFg) got rave reviews for how ageless it sounds

---

> [**”Love Story Wa Totsuzen Ni”** by **TWINKIDS**](https://youtu.be/S76n2Q8vsGQ)

TWINKIDS are a queer LA based electropop duo (their name IS a pun) and this is my favorite track from their 2017 EP *Boys Love*. This song is a cover of [a hugely famous Japanese song](https://youtu.be/VwJruL9nBwQ), and while the original is charmingly retro, this is sleekly modern. TWINKIDS give the song fresh life with trendy electronic production but the almost vaporwave vibe they go with helps it retain an air of nostalgia. They transform the song into a swirling duet and add plenty of bubbling synths that give a lot of layers to the song while still respecting how great the original melody is. They mesh well with the source material: they give it a more modern twist, it ropes in their tendency to get too ambient, and the end result is a really cool track."

1133,2020-04-20 18:41:53,g4ufrm,"Tinder Guy is officially like ACTUALLY officially dating Kansas girl. It annoys me that he said he ""wasn't ready"" for a relationship and then got into one less than a month later. I really wish people would stop saying they're not ""ready for a relationship"" when they just don't want one with YOU. Would have appreciated the honesty.

I kissed a girl last night (one of my best friends) and I liked it. Her boyfriend is super not jealous of when she does things like that but I also am never sure if he's hitting on me or just super overly flirty. If that's their relationship more power to em, I guess. It does suck to see your friends all paired up when you've just been unceremoniously screwed over by someone lying about their feelings (lack thereof.)

I wish I could get my sleep schedule back to normal. Seems like no matter how hard  I try, I can't get to bed at a reasonable hour. Then I sleep half the next day. I know it's probably stress related. 

I heard ""Cruel Summer"" for the first time today and I loved it, although it made me randomly start crying on the way home. 

There's a meteor shower tomorrow night that Tinder Guy originally told me about and was going to take me to. I've got a few different female friends, both of whom hate each other, that offered to go with me instead and we can use it as a like, re-centering moment where I set my intentions on moving on and what I want moving forward. It's nice but idk what's going to happen or if either of them will actually follow through. I'm okay, I guess, with going alone but I also don't want to be.

I don't know what it is, but it's just not giving me that buzz their other albums did. It's not bad but too many songs just blend together- only stardew, silkspun, and pink lightning stood out"
1136,2020-04-21 01:23:57,g4ufrm,did anyone see the AMA on here of that guy named Wil who said he worked with a lot of big names like Ariana when she was younger? was it here and disappeared  or am i confused?
1137,2020-04-20 20:33:27,g4ufrm,"Anybody else still watching Westworld? I feel like I'm watching at this point solely because Evan Rachel Wood is so fierce. Also I actually really like the setting of this season, it's very ""2000s futuristic"" it reminds me a lot of The Matrix or IRobot, especially a lot of Dolores's looks."

1143,2020-04-20 15:23:33,g4ufrm,"For some reason, it feels like it’s been ages since I started this school year, but mere months since that song dropped. I kinda miss the sweetener era, honestly. She was learning the ropes of lyric writing, and for the first time, even though she didn’t hit #1, the era felt like it belonged to her. I remember being on a day trip to New York when I checked her first day streaming numbers, and being blown away by how well she was doing."

1145,2020-04-20 15:55:30,g4ufrm,remains her best song!! holds a special place in my heart bc it’s the song that made me a fan of ariana and now she’s my #1 artist on last fm lmao. no way it’s been two years whaaaa

1149,2020-04-20 15:52:22,g4ufrm,Her album sequencing is so bad I haven't discovered some of the songs on the back half of her albums until like the 10th time I listened to it.
1150,2020-04-20 15:21:04,g4ufrm,"I think, honestly, if I had the opportunity to ask Taylor ONE question that she had to answer truthfully, I would skip over all her personal drama and ask her how the fuck she decides to sequence her albums"
1151,2020-04-20 15:19:41,g4ufrm,I hear YNTCD in (I think) an Amazon commercial a lot and honestly if it had different lyrics I think it would be much more palatable.
1152,2020-04-21 00:36:42,g4ufrm,"ugh I’ve already done that over zoom it’s so embarrassing lmao

1156,2020-04-20 18:47:10,g4ufrm,"Holy shit yes this is the perfect write up. Dancing Queen is my fav ABBA song and honestly one of the greatest songs of all time. One of the most danceable songs ever and sonically smooth as silk. Every time I listen to it I just picture myself at a 70s themed party grooving to that shit. My favorite aspect of the track is the repeated strike of the piano that hits throughout the song, but especially right after “digging the dancing queen.” It really is the ultimate disco song."
1157,2020-04-20 19:31:33,g4ufrm,I have nothing else to say because you covered all of it but Dancing Queen has been one of my favorite songs of all time since I was a child. And it always will be. It’s simply one of the best pop songs of all time.
1158,2020-04-20 18:43:14,g4ufrm,I agree with this and also have a similar feeling about Take a Chance On Me.

Those 2.5 hours are the only restful sleep I’ve been getting. And I constantly have dreams about high school, quarantine or not. I have a dream about forgetting my locker combination and the hallways empty out and the bell goes off and I’m alone panicking at least once a month! I haven’t used a locker in 10 years!"
1164,2020-04-20 17:08:25,g4ufrm,"oh my god yes. ive always slept poorly, but recently i haven’t gone a day without waking up at least once throughout the night. and some nights i wake up a few times from continuous nightmares, or even just super vivid dreams. i can still remember the dreams I’m having even days later. i think I’m going crazy too tbh"
1165,2020-04-20 17:10:59,g4ufrm,"I've been having the really crazy, vivid dreams as of late. And even though I don't do much during the day I wake up feeling exhausted."
1166,2020-04-20 17:30:32,g4ufrm,I had a dream I was walking down the steps and ran into Matty Healy who was walking up because he was walking on the left as a Brit and I was walking on the right as an American
1167,2020-04-20 18:45:19,g4ufrm,"Absolutely same. I have a hard time getting to bed, then when I do I wake up randomly a few times throughout the night, then go right back to bed. Then usually don't get up til almost noon.

And my dreams are super vivid as well. They're about mostly weird shit like one I had where an alien attack happened outside, but for some reason since we were inside this huge creepy school, the people in the school survived. Then a second wave of aliens came and started picking us off one by one."
1168,2020-04-20 17:04:34,g4ufrm,"I had to start taking melatonin because my sleep schedule was the worst. I’ve been having lots of dreams though, right before I wake up in the morning"
1169,2020-04-20 17:56:10,g4ufrm,Yeah I am waking up in the early am hours which is super unusual for me. Also having anxiety dreams like there’s no tomorrow :( at least we are not alone
1170,2020-04-20 17:22:36,g4ufrm,"I had a very vivid dream last night that involved me riding my bike and getting hit by a car, so that was cool."
1171,2020-04-21 01:52:08,g4ufrm,"I’ve been going to sleep at 4 AM (or later) for the passed week. Then I end up waking up at noon or even later. It’s for no reason, either. I just scroll on social media and by the time I look up it’s 2:30...3...3:30...

I had a dream that I worked at Arby’s last night (well, technically this morning), and so when I woke up I was craving Arby’s so I got Arby’s for lunch. Also in my dream they served “tiger ice cream” which is vanilla in a dish with caramel and fudge topping so now I want that, too. I don’t even think it’s a real thing, just something that I dreamt up, but it sounds good af."

I discovered her back in 2017 when the EP dropped and she was so fucking underrated back then!!  Also I kinda agreed about Comme des garçons at first being kinda meh but its definitely grown on me"
1175,2020-04-20 16:06:24,g4ufrm,"I had Cyber Stockholm Syndrome (on her EP RINA which you should listen to IMMEDIATELY) suggested to me by a friend and I slowly got into her discography from there. Cherry/Flicker were the two songs that absolutely SOLD me on her. Cherry is actually tied with Juice for my most listened-to non-Carly song according to my last.fm. 

She's just indie enough to fall below the normal pop radar, but lovers of the genre will love everything she has to offer."
1176,2020-04-20 16:16:33,g4ufrm,"Lmao same here, I only heard of her for the first time a few days ago from this sub and now I’m absolutely hooked. Her album has been on repeat

not innane customer requests, not bad managers, not legacy code that makes me want to bang my head against a wall, not waking up at 6am, its commuting. And my commute is only 30 min in the morning and 1hr in the evening. This WFH shit is so great"

But they apparently *don’t* practice by running a full marathon, because it apparently wears their body out pretty badly and they’d have to take a break afterwards. So slowly working your way up may not be the best thing for you knees.

Edit: But also these conversations were years ago and I could have misremembered, so maybe listen to actual experts lmao"

Really once you're going above half marathon distance I found it's just as much about nutrition and proper pacing strategy as much as actually running. It's really more like one 20 mile race and then one 6.2 mile race on top of it.

But I ran my first marathon in March and enjoyed the training and actual race a lot more than I thought I would! Good luck and def follow a training plan."

* [*Cry Pretty* by Carrie Underwood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUUjtUP2CrE) had some great songs on it, very pop but it still had that country twang.

• Liberation by Christina Aguilera - half the tracks are incredible (“Pipe”, “Like I Do”, “Twice”, “Accelerate”, “Right Moves”), the are pretentious or boring

• Good Thing by Leon Bridges - ugh he is just so perfect. if you like this disco resurgence we’re experiencing in pop rn, I recommend starting with “You Don’t Know” and “If It Feels Good”. if you like great vocal performances, look no further than “Bet Aint Worth the Hand”. if you like funky jazz, then “Bad Bad News” is the way to go. if you’re into country “Beyond” is so wholesome and wonderful. writing this lil review has convinced me to put on this album rn lmao"

I know barely any Spanish so take my translations with a grain of salt.

4. [Safe in the Hands of Love - Yves Tumor](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kwy8PNEbn19LvusmGArWGfE9LZ9g6avfo) (experimental pop/electronic/noise).

Lush by Snail Mail - an indie rock album, highlights are Pristine and Heat Wave but really the entire album is phenomenal tbh

“Normani x Calvin Harris” is just 2 songs, but Slow Down has insane production and still slaps as hard as it did two years ago

Whack World by Tierra Whack is also great with a very cool concept. it’s a rap album with each song being 1 minute long. 15 songs, 15 minutes

Ephorize and Eden by Cupcakke. both are funny with some incredibly clever lyrics. ephorize has a bit more of an amateurish charm, while Eden is much more polished, though I’d say both albums are equally as good"

1222,2020-04-20 21:08:18,g4ufrm,"It really is expensive and visiting isn’t the same as living, don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. I liked it but in the end it was draining. You have to be on top of everything and work your ass off to pay bills, plus you have to have roommates, it’s almost mandatory unless you’re rich. 

It’s my favorite city in the world so for visiting, I HIGHLY recommend it. My favorite places are The Met, The Highline and Prospect Park in Brooklyn. Also a very beautiful park called Fort Tryon park which is where the Met Cloisters are located."
1223,2020-04-20 21:27:28,g4ufrm,As someone who's super into art and film it's great. There are so much to do and you'll barely scratch the surface even after living here for years. But the cost of living is ridiculous. I live in one of the cheaper neighborhoods in Brooklyn and the rent is still crazy expensive.
1224,2020-04-20 20:40:24,g4ufrm,"I don’t live there, but I was in NYC for a week in February and I loved it. It’s the most popular city in the world for a reason. For me it was definitely like the movies because I was blown away by all the ridiculously high buildings and the liveliness and cultural history of the city. The Met was a personal highlight. 

I hope you get to visit sometime!"

1226,2020-04-20 17:09:56,g4ufrm,How has she been in the industry 15 years and doesn't realise being publicly salty because people criticised your album rollout is just going to fan the flames?
1227,2020-04-20 16:16:32,g4ufrm,"idk if this is what she’s talking about, but i saw she replied to a tweet today that said something along the lines of “how does it feel to be so hot but so talentless”"
1228,2020-04-20 16:27:58,g4ufrm,"I've seen Jon from Artv throw some tweets saying the release to the album is bad because she's releasing all the songs beforehand which is something he isn't a fan of but other than that, haven't seen much detraction"

1233,2020-04-20 22:45:54,g4ufrm,"Experimental electronic? Maybe PC music if we consider PC music a genre/style and not just a collective.

As for suggestions, I'm not super familiar with that style, but PC music producers like A.G Cook and Sophie have releases that I'd describe as similar to 100 gecs but more 'feminine' sounding."
1234,2020-04-20 23:33:02,g4ufrm,"I guess it depends what you like about 100 Gecs



If you like the loud maximalist production on like money machine or ringtone Clarence Clarity is like the more refined/slightly less chaotic version of that"

1242,2020-04-20 18:23:37,g4ufrm,It just felt like a blander version of their first two albums with no real artistic growth. The fact that there was a 5 year gap for a watered down rehash just made it super blah to me.
1243,2020-04-20 18:01:30,g4ufrm,"I think they were going for a more “vibey” feel to the album, but that decreases replayability for me. I still really love Stardew and Pink Lightning though so whatever. Shrines is still that bitch."

I watched, and loved the first season. Started season 2, and got busy with life, and didn't catch up after the third episode.

I never got back to it, I've been meaning to rewatch 1 and watch 2 to completion since 3 just started, but I've heard nothing so it's like ""well, is it worth my time?"""

1253,2020-04-20 15:32:57,g4ufrm,I think she tries to make a diverse track list that keeps you interested? It’s certainly a valid theory of how albums should be ordered but she takes it to such an extreme...
1254,2020-04-20 15:41:25,g4ufrm,"I’m just imagining that scene now. 

You’re at a secret session, surrounded by Taylor’s family and fans. She plays you a song that graphically describes how much better in bed Joe is than her other boyfriends. She says that the next track is one of the most important songs she’s ever written. She hits play, and a bop about how the Koch foundation is wrecking our planet begins to play. You raise your hand and politely ask her what demon possessed her to sequence the album that way. 

Every fan in the room turns to stare at you. There’s murder in their eyes. Maybe you’re imagining it, but you swear the brunette girl in a LoverFest shirt has a knife? You wonder how the hell she got it through the security here. Taylor’s parents look at each other with with a look in their eyes that says nothing but “did they lie?”

And then Taylor has to justify that choice. I can fantasize about every other aspect of this exchange, but I literally cannot think of any way for her to sequence her albums that is logical in any way."
1255,2020-04-21 00:36:55,g4ufrm,"My personal theory is that she puts all the tracks on a dartboard, then Jack Antonoff puts a blindfold on her and spins her around five times, after which she throws darts to determine the order."
1256,2020-04-20 15:24:58,g4ufrm,"Oh, the beat fucking slaps. I like the song enough, even with the lyrics, but like... it does not fit into Lover. At all."

I'm thinking if I hypothetically moved to NYC I'd move to Queens cos it's the least dense borough after Staten Island and apparently it's close enough to Manhattan to get a taste of the busy-ness of the city.

What do you think is the best area to live in in NYC?"
1287,2020-04-20 17:23:34,g4ufrm,Also men? Really?

I vividly remember her telling some guy to “eat a bag of dicks” several years ago on Twitter when he complained that she cursed a lot during shows despite almost never cursing in her music and he had brought his kid to a show. She can’t take criticism and really shouldn’t be on social media, especially during an album rollout."

But like...I'd have so much easier a time if he'd just said from the get go he wanted to see other people instead of ""I'm nOt ReAdY""."

So I've been putting off telling her that we're going to go anyway and just not go with her. My other friend was fine with leaving at 10 and staying out til whenever, and even said she'd bring the snacks and all.

Avoiding the telling her that I'm just going to go without her but still take the other friend because I'm pretty sure it'll turn into a big deal."

As for what was represented? Nothing surprising. A middle of the road concert of middle of the road performers singing comfortable and recognizable songs so that the intended audience (people with money to spare for donations) was made at home. If you want upper middle class Westerners to stick around and make some donations, you give them artists and songs they recognize, not a K-Pop band.

I’ve been obsessed with her song Bad Friend. It’s such a good song and unfortunately relatable for me. It reminds me of Green Day’s “Whatsername” in that it gives me that same sad/bittersweet nostalgic feeling thinking about somebody that you used to be super close to. 🥺"
1348,2020-04-19 17:05:41,g494sd,"I'm having an identity crisis. I realized that because I thought I was going to marry a man, I suppressed my attraction to women and the fact that I prefer them. I also realized I never liked a real man - all my male crushes were celebrities or because that man gave me attention. It's like I only like men in theory? I do find them attractive but never irl, unlike women. Do other bis feel this way or am I just struggling with heteronormality...I do not live in a gay friendly household which makes it harder to really dig into my truth. 

Either way, Miss Apple gave me the idea for my new flair that represents my feelings."

I've seen most of my heroes. I've seen Britney, I saw Prince! I met Kacey Musgraves and went to Charli XCX warehouse parties!

But I miss that collective feeling and feel sadness none of us will get to experience it for a while. I even miss paying $12 for a beer and that feeling when you're hungover and your ears are ringing the next day.

I don’t just mean for a day or so after a show. It’s a constant thing. Mine stemmed from something else but I’m sure concerts don’t help. I think I’ve read before that musicians often end up with it because of the constant exposure to loud music, etc. Apparently it’s all psychological, but it’s annoying AF and super noticeable at night. I will never get to have total silence again in my life and it’s hard to accept that."

2. Justin Bieber (71) - didn’t expect *Changes* to have this much longevity for me, especially since I’ve never been a Bieber fan until this album

3. The Black Eyed Peas (67) - finally getting into their new stuff (RITMO, Mamacita, Mami) but also powered by their back catalogue which I play quite regularly

4. Dua Lipa (62) - entirely from the new album

5. Niall Horan (50) - entirely from the new album

6. JoJo (49) - obsessed with “Man” and I’m revisiting some tracks on *JoJo (2018)*

7. Kiana Ledé (47) - entirely from the new album

8.* Jack Newsome (33) - someone on this sub recommended him and I’m obsessed. the excessive autotune reminds me of BENEE and Kim Petras

8.* Ariana Grande (33) - usually somewhere in the top 10 for me because of the sheer amount of content she puts out

8.* Kim Petras (33) - hasn’t released anything since February but I just listen to her a lot

•I know I'll probably be the only person who feels this way but I went on Instagram yesterday after the One World thingy and I saw that Gaga had put Shawn's performance in her stories saying ""I love you"" or something like that and it made me really emotional and I teared up a little. I know it isn't much but seeing my faves acknowledging each other and being part of the same event meant a lot to me.

1384,2020-04-19 16:21:03,g494sd,"Y’all, I’ve been on a Madonna journey lately. 

After watching the Madonna rusical, it made me realize that I haven’t dug into her older music aside from the singles in a while. I happened to listen to her first album randomly when I was just wanting to hear “Burning Up,” and it caught me by surprise. Such a fun album full of post-disco bops. Love it. I also went in and listened to Ray of Light front to back. As a kid, I remember not being crazy about the title track, so I wasn’t sure what to expect. I ended up thinking it was great and I understand why it has the acclaim that it does. I also suck because I heard Frozen a lot as a kid and didn’t know that was by Madonna! 

Now I’m starting on Bedtime Stories and man that sound has got me feeling all nostalgic. ‘90’s R&B/New Jack Swing just takes me back to childhood when my parents would play that stuff on either their record player or huge stereo system. So, this album is such a mood and once again I suck because I heard “Human Nature” a lot as a kid and didn’t know that was her. 

This ended up being long, lol. Thanks for reading wherever you are!"
1385,2020-04-19 20:30:04,g494sd,"Finally got around to playing *Deltarune*, I liked the expanded mechanics but it just felt... thinner? than *Undertale*. I get that it's just Chapter One but it felt like *Undertale* had the much more colorful, fully realized world.

And this is such a #firstworldproblem but I have $30 on the Switch store from a gift card my friend gave me and it's low-key stressing me out because I can't decide what to spend it on. I have a bunch of games in mind but I'm like... what if one of them goes on sale after I buy it for full price? And when they do go on sale I'm like, do I really want this or should I hold out for something better? Meanwhile I have games on there I haven't finished/opened... not to mention all the stuff in my itch.io account... and all the unread comics I have sitting in tabs.

Speaking of, I switched over to Firefox and it's a little annoying having to log in every time I boot up and it's a bit slow but it's decent so far.

I mentioned the other day that I liked *Neon Heart* by Roxie Cola and so I listened to their other EP *Lazarus Impulse* and I really liked it too, they snapped on [""Dearest Earth.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsDJlTKN8M) I love finding a small artist I click with, it makes digging through Bandcamp's recently released section worth it.

Speaking of, there's this weird tendency on there for people to tag, like, really hard rock albums as ""bubblegum"" or ""bubblegum pop"" and I'm like... why? Is there some kind of inside joke I'm missing out on?

Also finally got caught up on *The Magnus Archives*, I dropped off in the middle of last season because I didn't really like how focused it became on the unpleasant interpersonal drama between characters (like I hate to say it but even as someone who's been listening for years I still don't know all of their names) but the payoff and where this season is going is certainly interesting.

In other podcast news, *Uncanny County*, my favorite podcast, is coming back for a third season after a year of inactivity and I'm very excited. Been listening to *The Lost Cat* and it's fun, very strong aesthetic. Been considering starting my own podcast where I break down/analyze Barbie movies but as usual motivation is sparse.

I will be putting all of this audio drama listening experience to use though because I signed up for the Fresh Ink festival at a local theater so I'm going to be writing a 20 minute radio play for them to put on their Patreon. I've been to a ton of shows there and all the previous iterations of the festival in the time I've lived here so I'm glad I get to do one before I move, a shame about the circumstances. I'm still waiting on the exact prompt (they said I'd get it today but like... where is it?) but apparently it's supposed to be a Western, something I know NOTHING about so this will be a fight."

I'm staying with my parents and I never told them I was dating this guy (I was 20 and he was 27 and I was afraid of being judged... but turned out he was bad news so maybe it would've been better to have someone talk me out of it). It's hard to do anything but sit around and be sad. It's gotten a little easier but... still not great.

Also, IDK if anyone here is a big Killing Eve fan but I found last week's episode kind of disappointing, hopefully this one is better. I think the decision to hand off the show to a new showrunner each season was not a good one. It makes the tone and characters and style feel kind of all over the place. If PWB had commitments to Fleabag or didn't want to write more I get handing it over to someone else, but why keep doing it every season? It sets the new showrunners up to fail IMO."

1399,2020-04-19 19:57:43,g494sd,"I was honestly terrified that I wouldn’t immediately like Fetch The Bolt Cutters. I have a bad habit of not immediately falling head over heels in love with a lot of pophead’s classier favorites. Melodrama actually took a while to grow on me, for example. And everyone kept on saying how inaccessible it was, I was just terrified that it would be too much for me. 

Thankfully, that was the best album *experience* I’ve had since Thank U Next. 

It’s so good. It’s not even funny. This was my third attempt at listening to Fiona Apple (I listened to about half of Tidal in middle school before abandoning ship, then I listened to When The Pawn last year and didn’t think much of it), and GODDAMN, third time was the charm. 

Honestly, it felt more like I was entering someone’s mind than listening to an album. It’s so unique, I don’t even think I have the vocabulary to talk about it. Shameika, Relay, Cosmonauts, and For Her are the songs that stood out the most to me on my first listen, but every song was just so well crafted and *good.* If you’re putting it off, just give it a listen, and give it your full attention. Even if the music isn’t for you, the lyrics are absolutely stunning. You’ll find something to enjoy. 

Also Sawayama was way better than I expected. Chosen Family kind of scared me a little there, but I’m so glad that the album wound up being as good as (actually, way better than) the mini album. Paradisin is my favorite new track, although I swear I’ve heard the chorus before somewhere. 

This was a good week for new music, even if it was just those two. I hope that Fiona breaks the top ten of the Billboard 200, and I hope Rina charts (I’m not really expecting either though)."

#[*Safe Haven* by Ruth B](https://open.spotify.com/album/6FgtuX3PtiB5civjHYhc52?si=ercEv6SvRAqNGPgX71Q0yA)

**Genre/Length:** Pop + Adult Contemporary / 47 Minutes

* **For Fans Of:** Alessia Cara, LAUV, [The Aughties Singer-Songwriters Rate](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/g2upes/rate_suggestion_voting_thread_june_august_2020/fnno0oh/)

**Description:** Before Tik Tok was pumping out hits we had Vine, which spawned the massively successful “Lost Boy” which gave way to Ruth B’s debut album *Safe Haven*. Though not as commercially successful as “Peter Pan,” *Safe Haven* maintained the same dreamy qualities while adding an even poppier twist. The songs on this album are crafted around simple hooks and melodies, which are then bulked up by romantic pop production. Ruth B has a knack for storytelling and each song has a unique angle and a satisfying journey. It’s wise but in that youthful sort of way that tries so hard to be poetic and reach for something greater even when it doesn’t succeed it’s charming. It has a bit of the spark that the flash-in-the pan adult contemporary stars of the early ’00s had, updated with a more modern sensibility.  Like many one-hit wonders, Ruth B. deserved better.

**Positives:** Easy to listen to, relatable lyricism

**Potential Barriers:** A few weak tracks

> **Sample Track:** [“Dandelions”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8a4sUabCUo) is catchy, wistful, and romantic.

---

> [**”Staring At The Sun”** by **Vanic (ft. Clara Mae)**](https://youtu.be/0GvT724mt1U)

I was OBSESSED with this song back in 2017 and while the shine has worn off a bit, I still think it’s an expertly crafted pop song. Both Vanic and the singer bring their A-game and it pays off with a huge EDM banger. It’s a fairly straightforward track that compares looking at someone to staring at the sun, but the music elevates it to a whole new level.

&#x200B;

I actually have a cute little story about first listening to Rina and this is as good a place as any to share it - for my birthday this year my parents had come down to see me and we'd arranged to go this creperie I'd found near my Uni that had a deal on  that made it go from London prices to actually affordable. 

It was a lovely day - like the second sunny day in London of the year - and I put on a Ryan Beatty playlist since Boy In Jeans and Dreaming of David interspersed fit the sunny yet still cold/early spring sort of day it was. On walking back from the creperie to Uni, I had about 15 minutes spare so I sat on the steps beneath the Albert Memorial in the sun and just zoned out.

That was until the playlist ended and it got to the Radio - and the first song was Cherry, and I was entranced. And I played it on repeat the whole rest of the day, and now everytime I listen to Cherry it reminds me of eating loads of pancakes and being happy on my birthday and being legally allowed to go outside.

&#x200B;

Then I went to the V&A and saw Eddie Redmayne, good times."

I don't know any Lana or Madonna fans IRL so it's fun to see and meet people who love them just as much as you do. Especially people watching - man were there a wide demographic of people when I saw Madonna! Also I saw Lana in Nashville when I'd previously seen her in Vegas x2 and Chicago x1 and the Nashville demographic is so different compared to the Vegas or Chicago demographic.

And it made sense. In the streaming era, why did countries have different release dates for albums? Having a global weekly standard date for album releases would prevent piracy and increase sales. 

If Beyoncé released her self-titled classic on a Saturday, for an example, it’s unclear if Saturday would have been chosen for the standard date. Germany and Australia’s album release date was Friday before the new standard. 

It was bound to happen, but *Beyoncé* brought it to the attention of the music industry first."

It might imply housing policy that expands subsidized/affordable housing or rent control (or both) and provides better cushion in times of economic crisis (like now) by establishing moratoriums on rent collection or mortgage payment (on this point, consider many of the policies implemented presently in Europe).

It should be noted here that resentment is being expressed toward landlords a lot over Reddit when the critique is really more about the capitalist system that empowers landlords to determine the welfare of the poor/working class."

I don’t necessarily mind the show’s ending (I actually quite like the idea of what happens with Dany, even if the buildup and context are a joke), so it doesn’t bother me too much if it’s done well."

no but the switch lite can’t connect to a tv so it’s basically a handheld rather than a dual console"

1529,2020-04-19 15:51:55,g494sd,Ariana Grande is one of the greatest vocalists of our time. Her discography is impeccable and she’ll go down in history as an icon. My favorite artist of all time.

1549,2020-04-19 16:48:03,g494sd,That album is next on my list. Hung Up still slaps after all these years.
1550,2020-04-19 21:25:28,g494sd,"My secret to my diverse tastes is I just find people who are more interesting than me, hop on their feeds, and Frankenstein a personality together from what they're into. 

*Sayonara Wild Hearts* looks gorgeous but also I know myself and I hate rhythm games so I never bothered with it. It's the kind of game I'd force my friend to play so I could watch them do it. I've also developed this weird relationship to games like that where I know it'll be a gorgeous *experience*, but have a fairly fixed runtime with specific replay value. It's what holds me back from buying games like *Gone Home* or the other installments of *Baobabs Mausoleum*, it's in my head that this isn't a *game* and I should get something I can like, grind in or something lol.

I did play *Celeste*, it was one of the very first games I got for the Switch and I'm super proud I was able to beat it without accessibility features. I didn't even bother trying the DLC for real though, that was literally insane. I never played *Gungeon* but my housemate was obsessed with it and played it all the time so I feel like I already have the full experience. I already have *Nuclear Throne* and *Binding Of Isaac* anyways.

I mostly have indie stuff on the Switch as well, and tbh I feel like the non-indie selections are kind of slim? They opened strong with *Breath of the Wild* and *Super Mario Odyssey* but after that the console was kinda dead before *Animal Crossing: New Horizons* and the new Pokemon. I like the convenience of having all my indie games on the Switch but since so many of them were for desktop or other consoles it just feels like the Switch is less *special* than, say, the Wii or the DS were."
1551,2020-04-19 21:48:02,g494sd,"The game looked *gorgeous* but by ""colorful"" I mean it felt like the world had fewer shades to it. There were so many wacky moments and side quests and characters in *Undertale* and I felt like that aspect was missing from *Deltarune*. It didn't feel like there was stuff like the interactions with the dogs in Snowdin or the duck that carries you over a very small gap. There just wasn't as much personality, but I guess you're right that most of that didn't kick in until the post-demo portions of *Undertale*.

I spent like an hour trying to kill the secret boss before I just gave up, I'm so bad at dodging I could barely get past a few of his attacks. I did fine with the later bosses of *Undertale* but I only did the Pacifist run so I never actually encountered the insanely tough stuff."
1552,2020-04-20 15:31:46,g494sd,Thank you. Feels great to hear it from someone.

1561,2020-04-19 20:51:52,g494sd,Enjoy! I never finished the entire series so I'm finally doing that. But I've rewatched the first few seasons so much that when they put it on Netflix recently I immediately noticed all the jokes that got cut from the pilot. 🤦🏽‍♀️ It's a super addicting show.

1570,2020-04-19 18:43:28,g494sd,"It bothered me so much because of the poor execution and having it come out of nowhere. The show noticeably took a downturn in terms of writing quality and became more about the spectacle once they went past the books, kind of taking away from what made me love the show in the first place, the characters and the small moments between them, not a huge battle scene"

1575,2020-04-19 15:42:49,g494sd,Wow you actually kind of did it
1576,2020-04-20 05:54:11,g494sd,LMAO never gets old

1579,2020-04-19 22:11:37,g494sd,"That is not a stupid question at all!! And my answer would it does muffle sound to an extent. There are nicer earplugs you can get that let in sound clearer than the cheapo Styrofoam foams (I personally own these https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00RM6Q9XW/) and if you're really dedicated you can have them custom made by an ear doctor.

But honestly I generally don't wear them during the main act I want to see. I'll wear them between acts and try to find a spot where it's comfortably loud but not crazy to actually watch sets. Plus most pop acts play in big and medium sized venues where the sound people know what they're doing... the worst hearing damage I've had is in small bars and DIY venues where you can't hear everything anyway and I definitely keep my earplugs in the whole time there."
1580,2020-04-19 20:55:25,g494sd,Yeah like movies are released on different dates. It was super annoying.

1584,2020-04-19 22:10:16,g494sd,"Ohhhh... I see what you mean. My bad!

Jevil took me ages to complete because it felt like he would specifically target Ralsei and once he died I was basically screwed. I kept trying though and now I can beat Jevil without healing (if I get lucky)! His battle theme is also one of my favorite tracks that Toby Fox has written which is saying a lot because my man has a HUGE discography."

Each character offers a unique glimpse behind the gilded curtain of Hollywood's Golden Age, spotlighting the unfair systems and biases across race, gender and sexuality that continue to this day. ... Hollywood exposes and examines decades-old power dynamics, and what the entertainment landscape might look like if they had been dismantled

and it’s starring Darren Criss, David Corenswet, Dylan McDermott, Holland Taylor, Patti LuPone, Queen Latifah and Joe Mantello."

Things aren't black and white or good and bad, and this weird lack of nuance and critical thinking about anything leads people to just be in echo chambers. To go on your Hitler point, there's definitely reasons to see and point out any positive qualities, so you can see how he got millions of people to follow him through completely heinous acts.

This is like when Bernie said Cuba had a good literacy program and everyone flipped shit because he dared to say something positive about Castro. People are multifaceted, and ignoring all the good because they also did a lot of bad isn't conducive to any conversation."

However I have really flat feet, so because of that every time I jogged I would always wind up hurting myself.

1682,2020-05-04 05:53:43,gccyg9,That's amazing!! Huge kudos. I've definitely been eating but it feels different than when I boredom eat - eating to refuel feels so much better physically and mentally for me. I have wonky food issues anywho so I find the running helpful in retraining how I interact with food.

1684,2020-05-02 22:13:57,gccyg9,"None to Run is another program worth looking at- it (slowly) helped turn my very unfit self into a 3x a week runner. It’s a little gentler than C25K I think.

I’ve never been a runner, and I have screws in my ankle from a high school injury, so the bike is a great alternative and it feels SO GOOD. I’m glad you posted, because sometimes I feel groups like this can get a little defensive when you talk about working out. 

And yes!! 20 year old me had no idea how bangin her body was lol I know I likely won’t get back to that exactly but I would love to get close. My boyfriend and I put on some SERIOUS relationship gut (about 100 lbs for me) and sometimes it makes me so insecure about how cute I feel I was when we met even when he’s supportive."

And it'll show all the shoes that help with that issue. I'd read the reviews too. I haven't got my pair on the mail yet but that's how I found em!

She even played a second song for the interviewer off of the supposed ""new album."" Now a year later, and I'm booboo the fool. I don't want to put pressure on an artist to release something, but when she's been promising it for 5 years, like sis wyd....say what you want about Lana's horrible promo and rollout, at least she puts out music, or Lorde, who at least doesn't tell fans until she actually is going to release something. Even looking back at the interview, the fact that she still can't read music after 10 years in the business, or that she won't play instruments in front of other people??? 

Okay, that's the end of the rant. I love Sky Ferreira, I expect her to never release music again, and with how good *Night Time, My Time* is, that's okay I guess."

Mostly because when they don’t get the reception they‘re looking for, this just drags on and on while people don’t get any more interested.

At a certain point you’ve got to just accept it. If you drop and promote like 3 singles and they don’t catch on, what more can you authentically do? Take your 20-50K first week and go. It’s ok, nobody is on top forever."

- **Bridge Over Troubled Water** (Simon&Garfunkel): I was hesitant to listen to this since folk music isn’t really my thing, but I thought this album was so beautiful, even if it was a good deal more understated than other rock albums I listened to. The Boxer is one of the most addictive songs I’ve ever listened to, and the lyricism throughout the album, especially on the title track, is lovely. 

- **Graceland** (Paul Simon): once again, unsure if I would like this, but i found it beautiful. Simon writes thoughtful and incredible lyrics, and the production is consistently able to uplift the melodies and lyrics to the forefront. Standout tracks: I Know What I Know, Diamonds on the Soles of her Shoes

- **Station to Station** (David Bowie): this (along with Ziggy Stardust) seems to be the consensus best Bowie album. I liked listening to it, but I found myself going back to it less than Hunky Dory. 

Less new albums as I start getting to the end of my list, but I’ve been going back a ton to get previously listened albums (especially Quadrophenia, Hunky Dory, Wish You Were Here, Dark Side of the Moon, The Wall, Sgt Pepper, Abbey Road, Purple Rain, a couple songs from Back in Black, Rumours, In the Court of the Crimson King, etc). 

Does anyone have any more recs for classic albums?"

Side note: In Isaiah’s verse on “Pretty Little Birds” he says “Don’t mind them bitches that’s cleaning my house”. What does he mean by that? I can’t find an explanation online.

1711,2020-05-02 17:30:15,gc7xms,"#Underrated [FRESH] Threads is tomorrow

I'm glad that yesterday's Asian Pacific American Heritage Month post went so well, I've always made a huge deal out of it because my birthday happens to be in May so it's like, fate. I actually listened to at least one song from every artist people posted in thread and I'm going to dig more thoroughly into the ones I clicked with later but my brain is MELTING right now from all of the listening I've been doing, plus I still have to make the U[F]P. I need to stop putting so much work into this sub.

I watched *The Willoughbys*, the animated movie that Alessia Cara was in, and it was actually kind of amazing? One of the best animated movies I've seen in a while (though granted I don't watch that many). The visual style/animation was fantastic, there were so many details, the writing was really funny, I wasn't annoyed by any of the characters, and it's unusual to see a children's movie that's just straight up about abuse. I hate to say it but the weakest link was Maya Rudolph, I love her but she's never been a great voice actress.

I also noticed that *Moonlight* is on Netflix so I finally got around to watching that and like, surprise, the winner for Best Picture was good. As someone with a bad mom, the subplot about him and his mom really hit and the beach scenes were iconic. [It reminded me of this old SNL skit where these interrogators grill this guy for not liking *La La Land*, but then when he asks them if they liked *Moonlight* they talk about how important it is but make excuses for not seeing it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abn6cPxrc5w) and after finally seeing it, I kind of get why it didn't take off like a wildfire among audiences. 

It's kinda hard to watch, the themes are really heavy (the tolls of drug use on the family, forced machismo in lower income black areas, street violence) and although it's definitely romantic, it's not really a romance movie. At its core it's a coming of age movie about a black man extracting himself from the toxicity of the environment he was raised in, which isn't exactly a popcorn movie. Also, you know, the racism."

* I finally got around to listening to Fetch The Bolt Cutters last night on my Klipsch speaker and WOW it was like listening to it for the first time. Truly amazing. 

* Speaking of my Klipsch speaker, I really really really want wireless headphones that replicate the sound. 

* I also listened to Ultraviolence last night and the guitar solos in Pretty When You Cry and Shades of Cool are EVERYTHING. Makes my desire to get an electric guitar even stronger. 

* My state is lifting restrictions on the 4th and I'm not happy about that. Luckily I can continue working from home but I'm still going to pretend like the stay at home order is still in place. Though it will be hard for me to restrain myself from going to Home Goods/TJ Maxx since I'm moving and redecorating in 2 weeks."

With the lockdown though I have been forced to exercise by going for walks/longboarding around the neighborhood(s). 

Today I walked past someone watering their lawn with a hose and the smell of hose water hit me and like bam the nostalgia came over me of growing up playing in the sprinklers on hot summer days. Made me think that I haven't smelled that smell in ages."
1722,2020-05-03 01:41:14,gc7xms,"Did anyone watch an NBC soap opera in the early 2000s called *Passions*? That shit was insane, there was a 1,000 year old witch character with a little person sidekick (who was supposed to be a doll brought to live using evil magic) who held the forces of hell in her basement. A girl got pregnant by her half brother and shut herself up in a nunnery to try to starve herself into a miscarriage. There was a totally bonkers multi-week story arc that was a hallucinogenic take on *The Wizard of Oz* replete with flying monkeys and a yellow brick road. There was an intersex person blackmailing other characters who would wear a creepy mask. There was mind control devices, faked executions in federal prison, and an literal orangutan (as in an actual primate) who was a home care aide. It was like a fever dream on tv every day at 1:00 P.M. and I’ve never met anyone else who has actually watched it lol.

Edit: [here’s an article I just found](https://www.geek.com/television/revisiting-passions-the-craziest-soap-opera-ever-1798279/) that delves a bit into the show’s craziness."

The later seasons were much better than I was expecting/remembering. Guess I just needed some distance from when it originally aired and I was too salty about cast changes to see it through. Also I completely forgot it streamed online for the final season and the couple of f bombs had me shook lol. Anyway the ending had me weirdly sentimental which I wasn't expecting. Can't believe this show started back when I was starting high school. Feels like so much of my current sense of humor was shaped in part by Community. I really really hope we do get a movie.

They generally don’t have interesting voices or their songs just meander around nowhere. I loooved the song Rumours by Sabrina Claudio, but the album was like...oh *another* breathy sultry track about a bad relationship...ok...

I can tell now when an artist really has a vision and honestly...many of them don’t. I wish 8-10 tracks was the standard because shorter albums give less space to have 3-4 filler tracks that amount to nothing. There’s a lot of bad music out there, it has to be said. 

Surprisingly, PrettyMuch and Why Don’t We are both great, I really enjoyed their EPs. I feel like because they’re bands, there’s a priority in making sure their vocals actually sound good and interesting together.

Nothin' Matters and What If It Did by John Mellencamp is a genuinely great and underrated album.

Blood on the Tracks by Bob Dylan.

Also I have to say Billy Joel, I'm sorry but he's great. The Stranger is basically a greatest hits album, lots of classic tracks. 52nd Street is dark and jazzy and probably his best album. Glass Houses has some of his best songs (Through the Long Night, Sleeping with the Television On, You May Be Right and All For Leyna). The Nylon Curtain is a depressing Beatles tribute."

I can imagine them with their fists on their chin like Patrick Star listening to freeform jazz, like, ""I like what he did with this synth pattern."" 

You're correct. Drake is a popular and prolific musical wallpaper installer. He makes soft ""vibes"" music for parties and chilling with boo/bae/whoever. It's background music, that's what it's there for. Having an actual opinion on it is like having an actual opinion on those 'Lo-Fi Hip-Hop Beats to Study To' clone channels; you're doing it wrong!"

Ariana obviously didn’t invent the R&B sound, but I think her little spins she does on her songs makes it special. She literally sits and comps her own vocals and maxes out pro tools with her vocals and adlibs. Her vocal ability is also just insane so I think that adds to it."
1816,2020-05-02 17:44:06,gc7xms,"I don't think *thank u, next* is generic, but she definitely didn't invent that sound and JoJo most likely isn't using Ariana as a reference at all on this record"

She’s already established herself as one of the most dominant commercial recording artists in history, but if she spends the years ahead releasing ME!s, her cultural dominance and perceived value as an artist will long fade.

But if she spends the next few albums digging deep and refocusing herself as a singer-songwriter first and foremost (which is what I suspect she wants to do), I honestly think she’s one of the few people we’ll have for the long haul."

Taylor recently posted a picture of herself at home (which she doesn't often) and she posted it at 5:08 pm that's why Swifties think that a new single will be out on May 8th, which also makes 5 + 8 = 13 as Taylor's favorite number, also they speculate it is Cruel Summer because it's length is 2:58 ending with a 5 and 8"

1862,2020-05-02 16:53:13,gc7xms,"Depends on which culture you grew up in. 

I think it’s a really good thing to show that it’s okay to talk about sex and partake in sexual activities as a teenager, as long as it’s made clear that sex should be done in a safe and consensual manner and only be performed when both parties feel like they’re ready for it. It’d also be naive to act as if teenagers don’t have sexual fantasies and desires, so removing or cutting down on this theme in shows would be rather ignorant.

I’m used to this perspective on sex, as Dutch people are known for being very receptive and accepting towards sexual topics and depictions (there are barely any stigmas here), but I could imagine people from other cultures that are known for being less open about sex being very uncomfortable about this.

But still, no one’s stopping you from skipping those shows if you feel uneasy watching them!"

I know Ariana's vocals and her production of them is what makes her stand out, but I guess I realized her lyrics are generic in the sense that Jojo's new songs have the same attitude and way of speaking of Ariana's tu,n.

I think AG6 will mirror the sounds and theme of Jojo’s new album, but Ari will still put her own twists on the lyrics and make them specific to her. She’s been on the road for awhile so I think she’ll have a lot to say from her time on the road during tour and what’s been going on with her life post tour. I don’t feel like Jojo’s album was generic either though, I thought it was super good and different from what I’ve heard from her in the past.

Sex *is* part of our lives. People have sex all the time and that's completely fine! Nothing shameful about it. At least it isn't shameful here to talk about sexual stuff. Seems like the USA are less progressive when it comes to this?

>to keep pumping out tv shows about horny teenagers played by super attractive 20-somethings, which are being consumed by adults.

That's Hollywood for you, haha. I don't necessarily approve of that either, especially when the cast is at the end of their twenties, but as long as the show delivers a healthy message regarding sex to its young audience and shows that sex is actually quite normal, I'm okay with it. I can separate a fictional character from the actor.

It'd be a different story if a 30-year-old cast member (playing the role of a 16-year-old) has to make out with a 16-year-old cast member performing a role based on their own age. That would be quite tricky here.

I think you're also forgetting that those shows are most popular amongst teenagers and are not *just* being watched by adults who get horny by watching teens."

Especially since they usually come complete with scenes that objectify underage characters for the audience. 

The sexualization of minors is something that I'm very firmly against and I get that they cast people who are older than their characters but I think that that just contributes to a separate set of issues amongst actual teenage fanbases by skewing their perceptions of what they should look like or what's healthy/normal for someone in their age group. For example, like the OP said, featuring a kiss between a 29 year old and someone barely 18."

1915,2020-05-02 18:25:08,gc7xms,"I think it's very much perspective-based. I wouldn't say shows like *Sex Education* are purely about the sex lives of the teenagers featured in the show. Rather, I would say it's about them *discovering* their sexuality, which is a completely different thing to me. There's quite a large focus in this show specifically on other plots as well, e.g. gender struggles and tensions between children and their parents, etc. 

I would also argue that *Sex Education* actually portrayed sexual discovery in quite a down-to-earth manner? There's barely any glorification of intercourse in the show, as it also depicts embarrassing moments during sexual encounters and shows that sex isn't just this amazingly glorious thing. It's something that we have to explore and get comfortable with, if we even desire to partake in sexual activities in the first place (which is also portrayed by one of the characters in the show).

> The sexualization of minors is somethignt that I'm very firmly against

Me too! But I actually think that all of the examples you picked do not necessarily sexualize minors, except for *Big Mouth* maybe, which target audience is clearly adults. The other shows are very clearly aimed at a teenage audience, so the messages in the shows are encrypted in a way that is suitable to that audience and are expected to be read by this group. I don't think there's anything overtly sexual and unacceptable going on in those shows. And if for some reason some perverted adult still finds a way to get off to a bunch of fictional teenagers performing staged sexual activities that actually look rather clumsy, that is their issue. You can't just cut sex out of teenage shows just because some people might sexualize it, otherwise you would send a message to young people that sex is shameful and sexual fantasies are to be suppressed. 

At least, that's how I perceive it, haha! :,) Again, I think cultural differences do really play a big part here."

90s was more concerned about one-hit-wonders, street rap, R&B fads and big belters filling AC radio. I don’t know if the mid-90s had any „pure pop“ songs like the mid-80s.

2000s was the decade I was a kid and That’s why this decade will always have a special place in my heart. Also the superstars of that decade were fun to watch and stan. 

2010s started out promising, but I noticed that after 2016 the fun left the charts. Funnily, this was also the year things got more serious for me personally and I had to face adult problems and shit."

And since it is a new month, [here’s a 10x10 of April](https://imgur.com/a/qlPe3Rv)


It’s Friday, my dudes. The weather in New Jersey is supposed to beautiful this weekend  and our governor signed an EO that county and state parks can open up again. Hopefully people aren’t knuckleheads, Gov Murphy’s actual words, and they practice social distancing and all that. This weekend is a huge test. If we fuck it up, we’re fucked forever pretty much. Pretty sure we’re gonna be fucked based on observations in the municipal park behind my house just over the last two weeks.


With the good weather though, I hope to get out on my bike on Saturday and Sunday. If I’m lucky, I’ll get in a nice 40 miles between the two in honor of the 5 Boro Bike Tour that isn’t happening this weekend that I’ve done every year since 2016.


As for that Parks and Rec special last night? I thought they did a really nice job with it. I know I’ve watched the show over and over since it ended but it was nice to see the gang back together again, as much as they could be at least. And it felt right. It felt believable, I’m just glad this one made my heart happy.

Nickelback, Avril Lavigne, Outkast, Sean Paul, Nelly Furtado, Mya, Ciara, Christina Milian, Linkin Park, JoJo, Jessica Simpson, Gwen Stefani, The Pussycat Dolls, Gorillaz, Akon, Natasha Bedingfield, T-Pain, Cascada, Danity Kane and The Script.

* Finished my scores for the 2019 Main Pop Girls Rate but haven't sent them in yet because I'm still toying with my comments. I assumed based off of how much I hated *reputation* that I'd dislike *Lover* too but it was pretty alright, I actually ended up giving it a higher average than *thank u, next*. 

* Still not crazy about the 2015 cast recording of *A New Brain*, despite it having some great performers and being a more technically coherent show it just lacks the heart and electricity of the original.

* Finally got around to listening to *Songs From An Unmade Bed* and it was nice, I don't listen to a lot of lieder but it's always nice to hear something gay.

* The new GWSN mini-album???? I hate to say it but they just became the best Kpop group on the scene right now, nobody has been able to deliver as consistently as they have.

* I listened to Rosemary Ashe's solo album *The Killer Soprano* and it's very unusual because the Spotify recording has audio glitches? Like, the audio on Spotify sounds like you're listening to a scratched up CD that keeps stuttering, I've never heard anything like it.

* Watched some Bollywood movies and it inspired me to revisit *Bombay Dreams*, the A.R. Rahman jukebox musical that was my introduction to Bollywood when I was younger. It'd probably be a little bit gauche these days but I appreciate that it at least happened, I can't think of any other musicals that really spotlight Indian culture like that other than *Bend It Like Beckham: The Musical* (a favorite of mine). I love the song [""Closer Than Ever""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmwuxTrGK20) in particular. Now that I'm an adult I might go and look up the original songs these are based on, that could be fun.

* *Bombay Dreams* inspired me to revisit Nitin Sawhney's music and it's also still good. People really should give [*Beyond Skin*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFfaUVqY_OU) a spin, it still sounds ahead of its time.

* *Bombay Dreams* also inspired me to revisit Tamyra Gray, the former American Idol Season 1 star who did a stint in the show on Broadway. Her lone album is very good, sort of Christina Aguilera-esque with [some bops.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1mMT7Hbycc)

* Listened to some random rap album I found on Bandcamp called [*Stardust Symphony* by Red Comet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhOe6_dAPKc) and it was pretty good! Cute, well produced, strong choruses, I'd recommend it if you're into the wholesome rap thing.

* Turns out I CAN still sing any song from *Into The Woods* from memory and I spent a nice afternoon just doing that.

* Also this is a behind the scenes moment but I actually did a whole writeup for *Groundhog Day* for my 2017 albums thing before realizing *The Band's Visit* came out that same year so I did that instead. Still, I have a friend who saw *Groundhog Day* on Broadway and now it's one of his favorites so it's always a little bit sentimental for me."

2030,2020-05-02 04:25:43,gbjt8i,"Welp seems like an excessive post, but for anyone interested, here's my review of the latest Drake Remix! 

 

The rise to prominence has been a captivating one for Toronto born, singer, songwriter Drake. Leaving it at that would be an understatement, as the Canadian has hit the world by storm, amounting to at times unparalleled levels of success. Throughout his now seasoned esteemed career, no other artist has managed to muster quite the familiarity with worldwide domination, nor have many managed to stand the test of time and proven to have such a wealth of sustained longevity. And that’s exactly where Drake becomes an enigma. Despite his now incomparable career, the man has never managed to cease public complaint and critical slander. This has seemingly become a more of an obvious trend with each year, managing to bafflingly coincide with even more defiant rises to fame. With the superstars last major original release being the controversial 2018 release ‘Scorpion’, Drake has uncharacteristically stayed low, and away from the charts, only to now unveil his latest body of work ‘Dark Lane Demo Tapes’.

The mixtape wastes no time in setting forth its aspirations to achieve a profoundly dark, grimy, and moody sound palette with its introductory track ‘Deep Pockets’. The production carries the aforementioned through its highlighting of fragmented synths and an understated shimmering, ascending synth melody. The track basks in a sea of chaotic and unpredictable production choices. Whilst these start as a set of unique instrumental choices, they quickly become monotonous and an increasingly difficult to stomach sound due to the sheer raw intensity. Vocally the song is stained with a classic Drake performance, leaning more towards his methodical, conscious sound during the verses. Upon the interception of the chorus, the track is disrupted with the first of many an unflattering sequence of unapologetically lazy performances. Whiny, and repetitive it lacks both character and substance. Lyrically the song only adds to the plethora of tracks in the Drake catalog that are concerned with describing his now-infamous come up from rags to riches. What appears to be a drastic change of pace, unfortunately, unravels as it lifts the guise to expose its blatant conformity to the overused Drake formula.

An increasingly apparent trend within Drakes recent output is the overriding sense of laziness. Album or single, at this point in time Drake almost feels synonymous with the movement of coasting by producing the bare minimum. One song that seemingly idealises this trait is the track ‘Time Flies’. Production-wise, the track features a lifeless synth movement that remains a stagnant, colourless feature throughout the song's duration, ultimately becoming a feature utilised to fill an otherwise blank void. Drake attempts to bring the track back into focus with his sweet-toned and emotionally vulnerable vocal performance whilst describing a frigid love experience he attempts to piece back together, as he so often does, yet the song feels too far gone with the invasive synths swamping over and consuming everything. Another track that conforms to the uninspired and stripped back Drake ideal is ‘From Florida With Love’. On this occasion, the fault falls to Drakes flat and distanced vocals. His overriding monotone voice screams of being devoid of colour whilst having an inherently deflated sound that kills any and all momentum on the song. Irony plays a large part in this track as the chorus consists solely of Drake exuberantly exclaiming his return, a feature that only adds to the mixtape's extensive list of misconstrued, distasteful and corny elements that occur throughout the body of work.

Despite the wealth of shortcomings that are ever so consistently spread across the mixtape, Drake undeniably litters sparks of creativity and energy throughout. The first major highlight stems from the bombastic cut, ‘Landed’. Bringing some much-needed energy as a point of contrast to the previously dreary, lifeless, and sluggishly paced batch of tracks, Drake struts his true knack for rapping. Sounding the most invigorated and gritty he has in some time, the lively, bombastic approach is a beacon of colour amongst a body of work that opts to conform and meld into dull sludge. The production matches the sheer energy and in your face nature of Drakes braggadocious rapping. Warped, invasive synths flutter in the background, establishing a sense of organised chaos as they ebb over the top of relentlessly crisp, steel percussion. Everything ties together to meld influences of psychedelic production with boom-bap delivery to deliver what is in fact the most colourful of tracks on the mixtape.

Drake further demonstrates his evident ability to truly craft a highlight on the song ‘Demons’. Ushered in by glorious, grandiose choral vocals the track has an unparalleled sense of intensity and divinity. Buried underneath the raw intensity of the piercing vocals is a bubbling, reverbed bass line that brings a lovely warmth through its low register embellishments. Drake matches the production with a captivatingly equal parts authoritative and gritty performance, adopting a grime approach to his delivery. The track features a pair of unfamiliar faces with the likes of Fivio Foerign and Sosa Geek joining Drake for what feels like his grand ascension. The two on paper may seem like a point of contention with their overly expressive, zany vocals and sparse delivery, yet manage to bring an almost comical and animated relief to the song.

As is to be expected with the release of such prominent artists' work, the mixtape has its fair share of high profile collaborators. Whilst it isn’t accurate to right off every single performance from a featured artist, its safe to conclude the mixtape sees more than its fair share of unwanted attention. The first track that exposes this lack of chemistry between Drake and the featured artist is ‘Desires’. Merging together the likes of the supposed dynamic duo of Drake and Future, the track struggles to find a middle ground that manages to cohesively fit both of them. Drake takes the reigns of the track, unfortunately splashing out with yet another overly monotone and unexpressive vocal performance. It feels as if Drake were just a distant figure with no means or desire to sound invested. Future on the other hand, whilst present, sticks out like a sore thumb with his intoxicating and overly murky vocals. An element of myself finds mentioning anything further in regards to Future redundant due to his laughably short appearance, out of place when present, forgettable when not, and overall a pointless inclusion to the track. Whilst the eerie, unsettling synths that swamp the production make sense within the grand scheme of the LP, on the track specifically it comes off as a very lazy attempt to maintain a consistent sound. Here more than ever does the production sound stripped back and devoid of creative input. Nothing on the track pops or stands out enough to leave a lasting impact, as it ends up being the worst product after considering all possible outcomes.

Another track that sees the hopeless mismatching of Drake and an outside influence is the long-awaited ‘Pain 1993’. On this occasion, vocal chemistry goes out the window, with the previous example of the forgettable Future being swapped for an unpalatable Playboi Carti appearance. Carti sticks out like a sore thumb with his pitchy, unbearable vocal inflections. Carti, obviously synonymous with his renowned baby voice, fails to find refuge in a sound even he would describe as familiar. It feels as if the novelty of his act has worn off and even he feels like a stranger to it. Flow wise, Drake sacrifices his own efforts in an attempt to conform to a Carti led delivery. It is through an already evident lack of chemistry in which the problem is worsened as the supposed lead artist steps out of a limited comfort zone in order to accommodate for the disaster that follows. At this point in the mixtape, even elements of the production are guilty of recycling tropes. Utilising a now formulaic sequence of dreamy, ebbing synths that feature the occasional ascending, shimmering pinging, it feels as if even the instrumental does the bare minimum to stay alive."

2042,2020-05-02 01:51:23,gbjt8i,"Hey all, I just wanted to know if anyone had any sad song recommendations - I've used Melodrama as my go-to album (and Lorde in general) when I'm feeling down but I need something new to cry and get my feelings out to. Thanks!"
2043,2020-05-01 15:58:02,gbjt8i,"Am I the only one who feels Ariana didn't do a very good job with the ""I Won't Say I'm In Love"" cover? Like, I felt she was holding back and the way she sang the song was very devoid of emotion. On a related note, I think she wouldn't do a good job as Megara in the live action. They don't look like each other, they don't sound like each other, it's a mess."
2044,2020-05-02 03:12:54,gbjt8i,What are some interesting podcasts/documentaries ya'll listen towatch? Pop music related would be nice but just anything interesting works. I'm only subscribed to Netflix and Spotify so something in that realm or on a free platform like Youtube would be best pls.

Her announcing Rain On Me only further added to it but now w this Justin collab announcement its like she got a flat tire and is taking a step backward. Dont get me wrong, Justin is talented, but... now I feel like Gaga isnt gonna want to make Rain On Me a single bc of this announcement."

2063,2020-05-01 19:54:45,gbjt8i,Oh I love the idea of running to the length of an album!!! I do that all the time but specifically with cuz I love you and rep lol. I could use some variety

I've been biking more since I realized my motivation to run has died with the two runs I was excited for getting cancelled. But god dammit, I bought a running watch and I need to use it for running! 

Cross Training is good for the soul or something too, anyway.

I don't know what platform would be best, but I do know I already got, and heavily use, Strava."

2068,2020-05-01 16:37:34,gbjt8i,Serious question. Why did he wait so long to announce they’d be closed for the rest of the year? I feel like that should have been a given.
2069,2020-05-01 15:39:59,gbjt8i,"I'm not going to say it was directed towards Beyoncé but the timing, especially after the remix, is very... weird. Whew I don't know how to explain it but yeah.

Edit: from reading other comments in the thread, apparently the last verse can be directed at either Wendy Williams or Cardi B as well... At this point I don't know what to think"

2073,2020-05-01 15:42:47,gbjt8i,"Bi, and for me not at all. I get the concerns but, face value there's really nothing to it. 

(and yes, I've considered arguments on bi-erasure, nicki's history, etc etc - but if anything, if you dont find it good/funny its more tacky than actually problematic, yknow?)"
2074,2020-05-01 16:26:12,gbjt8i,"Bi woman here, yeah I didn't like it. Felt like bi-erasure. But, also didn't feel clever and was complete unnecessary?"
2075,2020-05-01 16:04:40,gbjt8i,"That verse is bad for other reasons. 

That line makes me uncomfy because of her subtle homophobia in the past, but... I mean, it’s blunt, but I don’t think it’s offensive in its own right."
2076,2020-05-01 16:38:23,gbjt8i,"Bi, and if anything I thought it was just lazy and not clever. Definitely plays into an annoying stereotype but it doesn't personally bother me."
2077,2020-05-01 17:25:32,gbjt8i,"I didn't get offended, but I think it's stupid. It perpetuates the idea that bisexuality is temporary and that after some time you become hetero/gay. I have already dealt with idiots with that mindset, but having a mainstream piece of media saying it too... Damn."
2078,2020-05-01 23:59:41,gbjt8i,"People are arguing that it's a good representation of sexual fluidity, but it just seems unnecessary and bordering on playing into the ""*bisexuality is a phase*"" stereotype. If that wasn't her intention, she probably should have picked a better context for explaining her evolving sexual preferences

also, using a line to affirm your heterosexuality is just... unnecessary? I'm really not sure what she was going for but it didn't land"

2087,2020-05-01 15:41:56,gbjt8i,"I think she was dissing Beyonce though... From scrapping the old version of the Say So remix to add new lyrics when the Savage remix dropped to saying ""That real ass ain't keep your nigga home"" as a response (?) to Beyonce talking about how her ass is real on Savage.

Besides, Wendy has brought her husband up a thousand times I don't think Nicki can do damage control anymore."

2098,2020-05-02 03:18:21,gbjt8i,"I would add Imogen Heap perhaps and Tori Kelly.

I'd remove Linkin Park maybe because if they did like a memorial song to Chester or just a comeback in general I think just off nostalgia alone it might at least chart. Gwen also is charting right now and had a song in the Top 20 but it might be a fluke."
2099,2020-05-01 23:14:23,gbjt8i,"The only one you’ve listed that I think I disagree with is The Script. I feel like they’ve been slightly more relevant in the past 5 years than the rest of those names. They might have one more in them? But then again, maybe not."
2100,2020-05-02 14:18:19,gbjt8i,"Gwen has a top 20 hit now. It’s a country song with her husband that is probably being carried by radio. It’s not very good either but I’m sure it counts somewhat. 

I feel like either Sean-Paul or Ciara have enough goodwill to have a minor comeback if they work with the right artists, but I can’t see them doing it solo.

Edit: I just saw you pointed out Gwen. Sorry about that!"

2105,2020-05-02 03:23:02,gbjt8i,I'd like to see Doja featuring on an Ariana song for a change. I feel like Doja's style and personality are too strong for many other artists to fit in very well into her songs. Like I could totally see Ashnikko or Lil Nas fitting into a Doja Cat song but not a more 'serious' artist if you know? But I think Doja could start building her Nicki-like list of pop songs to feature on and Ariana would be a good start to it if the youtube mashups are any indication.

2116,2020-05-02 03:19:48,gbjt8i,"No. Say So might scrape in a Top 3 hit but with both Drake and Travis Scott coming it's gonna push it down. Savage will be an assured Top 10 hit, maaaaybe could see it hitting Top 5 but unless she does another remix or something I doubt it'll go much higher."

[**Citations Needed**](https://soundcloud.com/citationsneeded) is about the power of PR and news media, kind of like a podcast full of updated Manufacturing Consent case studies. A lot of what you thought you knew about the world, it turns out, is made up and pushed by right-wing think tanks. Their episodes on [rehab reality TV shows](https://soundcloud.com/citationsneeded/episode-99-the-cruel-voyeuristic-quackery-of-rehab-tv-shows) and the [pseudoscience of TV detectives](https://soundcloud.com/citationsneeded/episode-94-the-goofy-pseudoscience-copaganda-of-tv-forensics) are soooo good.

[**True Anon**](https://twitter.com/TrueAnonPod) is about conspiracy theories and opening that third eye 👁️👁️👁️. Their [episode with Yasha Levine](https://soundcloud.com/trueanonpod/radio-free-trueanon) is a great walkthrough of American soft power/Radio Free Europe/Asia, and the extent of intelligence technology in our lives.

[**Radio War Nerd**](https://www.patreon.com/radiowarnerd) is Patreon-only but [this free episode on the Millennium Challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJ6Tzij-Pbs) wowed me so I immediately went and subscribed. ([MC2002](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Challenge_2002) was a US war game where the US gets demolished by Iran, and the US players had to repeatedly break rules/the game's own logic in order to eke out a victory.)"

Their first campaign (Deliverance, OH) used Monster of the Week, which is based on monster-of-the-week shows like Buffy, Supernatural, X-Files, etc. It has 45 episodes so there’s a lot of content there if you like it. Also, iirc they’re planning on returning to some of the characters after they finish their current campaign (Tango Sector), which uses Scum and Villainy, a sort of heist game in space. There’s currently 14 episodes of that (I think we’re on their 5th job?).

Also, there’s at least a few (most?) of the people on the podcast that are LGBT, so there’s no shortage of LGBT characters/themes in either campaign. (I’m assuming that’s a plus, unless you’re one of the ~5 cishet people on this sub)"

2133,2020-05-02 04:25:51,gbjt8i,"Continuing a largely emphasised pattern within the recent releases within the Drake catalog, the mixtape has more than a few throw-aways. Existing purely to satisfy a market that Drake manages to successfully oversaturate, it feels second nature for each of his eras to welcome a new fad that toys with the virality of his name. ‘Toosie Slide’ stands out among the rest as a song that blatantly adopts its inherent Drakisms. Continuing his streak of uninspired, pop-centric tracks, the song features one of Drakes most comatose, half baked, monotone performances to date. Unfortunately coating the track with this immense sense of boredom, Drake prevents any of the potential from other elements of the track shine. The subtle, dreamy yet triumphant synth melody becomes stale quickly due to its inability to evolve and eventually ends up meshing all too well with Drakes lifeless performance. This song, in particular, feels as if it were born purely to satisfy a trend that capitalises on advertisement from tiktok, dressed with its hook that features a numerous amount of corny dance instructions, Drake once again coasts by doing the bare minimum and thriving through his observation of trends.

The conclusive track on the project feels equally as uninspired and devoid of integral artistic input. ‘War’ sees Drake channeling his inner grime artist, a shtick he fails to conform to, all whilst sounding more corny and clunky than usual. His attempts to switch to the more experienced, gritty tone is done in an attempt to embody the songs implied imagery of war, as the lyrical content sees Drake firing shots at his opposition, whilst reconciling with fellow Canadian artist The Weeknd. Despite his attempts to form a confronting sound, the song struggles to reach a point of genuineness due to the inherent goofiness Drake portrays through his poor rendition of a drill performance. Performing over a poorly mixed and cheaply produced repetitive synth refrain, alongside the traditional lifeless, stock standard percussion, even the instrumental falls short of evoking Drake as the sovereign like figure he builds himself up to be. The song ends up being a poorly misconceived attempt of intimidation, failing on all accounts to be the bombastic terror Drake had hoped it to be. Looking to the greater scope of the mixtape, this cut feels like perhaps the weakest to close on. Lazy in all the worst ways possible as well as being the most distant sound from the bulk of the record, Drake leaves listeners with a lasting sensation of a sour taste with the final moments of the LP.

Drake only feels as if he hinders his progression artistically on ‘Dark Lane Demo Tapes’. Whilst it feels as if he is transitioning back into a form that supported his most critically successful eras, the mixtape is littered with a multitude of the same tropes that plagued his latest commercial releases. Following the spotlight he so persistently chases, the album adds to an extended catalog that finds refuge in this idea of capitalising on pre sustained success rather than striving for artistic progression. By no means does it stick up to the sheer droning intimidation that was his previous body of work, ‘Scorpion’, but this project still manages to miss the mark, yielding highlights few and far between. More than anything, the project feels like a misconceived, incoherent collection of loosies and half baked ideas that perhaps wouldn’t fit onto a more grandiose release from the man. Not much in the way of overly offensive material, whilst simultaneously offering much in the opposite way. This, unfortunately, has become the mindset and general direction of Drake material and given the audience response, it would seem fit for him to continue this trend as he so easily continues to forge his legacy.

2136,2020-05-01 16:03:57,gbjt8i,"I like it would've looked a bit obnoxious if she'd been a bit over the top. I can just hear the 'why is she being so extra?' comments.

For something she recorded and mixed herself on an iphone in one day, doing back melodies herself, getting little props and doing it all without help in her own house she did a damn good job I think. I'm not sure what else was needed?

Also for the movie, she looks more like Meg than most of the other actresses people want (Liz Gilles, Aubrey Plaza for example) and sure she sounds different to Susan Egan but I believe the point is to make something fresh and not just try and copy Susan Egan's Megara?"
2137,2020-05-01 16:03:57,gbjt8i,"I think she did a fine job on the cover. At the end of the day it's a girl in er bedroom recording it on her iphone and sending it off to be quickly stitched together and aired.

I don't wanna say right now we shouldn't be critical of these performances we are being given, but I do think some people aren't taking the actual situation in full view and critiquing like it's a regular performance.

As for the upcoming Hercules film, I think it depends on who is cast as Herc. I don't think your actress or actor needs to look like the cartoon character, but I think she'd do a serviceable job with it. The only thing I really want out of that film is some sweet Herc slaying Hydra visuals."
2138,2020-05-01 17:56:33,gbjt8i,"I've said this before about her performance of ""The Wizard And I"" and her performance in *Hairspray* but I don't think she's good at singing musical theatre. Her emotional repertoire is somewhat limited; she's amazing at singing about the things she sings about in her own music but can't do more ""unusual"" songs because she's so concerned about sounding pretty all the time she can't really let go."
2139,2020-05-01 16:04:07,gbjt8i,"I thought she did alright, the performance of ""still hurting"" made it look pretty bad though to be honest."
2140,2020-05-02 02:40:10,gbjt8i,"The cover was fine but everyone needs to chill with the recasting hype. She’s a professional singer, it shouldn’t be surprising when she does a good job at performing. It doesn’t mean she should play the whole character."

2152,2020-05-01 16:53:44,gbjt8i,"I think because schools function as other resources - drop in programs for parents who go to work early and need their kids somewhere safe, food programs for hungry kids, after school camps, etc etc. When you're planning on when to end the lockdown, schools are important because you can't have the adults going back to work but schools are still closed. Who is going to take care of the kids during the day?

So I think its less about the school itself and more about what that means for easing the lockdown, food bank programs, etc."

Every time I check the weather on my Dark Skies app the rain keeps getting pushed back further and further. Think I'm gonna risk it and go out for my normal lunch walk. 


I have no idea what summer could look like. I've joked with a friend before, half serious half not, that I don't care what is going on, I'm having one beer on the beach this summer and not even getting arrested can stop me.

As soon as someone stops being a ""main pop girl,"" suddenly their past influence and power is seen as completely worthless and their entire work is discredited. 

Avril Lavigne and Kesha were huge forces during their peak -- Kesha has had 22 hot 100 charting songs and Avril Lavigne has been credited as a source from numerous artists, such as Paramore, on why record companies had signed them. But because these artists are no longer the force they once were, they're deemed as a flop even if their current releases are a moderate success. It's odd, and frustrating"

Slightly related but I stumbled upon this Instagram page that compares celebs before and after plastic surgery looks, and some are quite shocking. But I truly believe all of them look better before surgery, even with a slight procedure. It could be that the “look” thats popular and super present nowadays is getting stale, but I think that’s still a valid point. It’s actually making me reconsider getting a nose job because I actually have grown to like how I look. I don’t look like anyone, I’m truly myself. Plus who knows— the way I look can become en vogue in a few years, whereas the hot people now will be so dated!

Edit: what I meant with “distinctive” is if it’s unique. I know everyone thinks about Ari when it comes to a high ponytail, what I mean is how hard it is to achieve the look Ari is known for. In constrast, I could wear the same outfit and makeup Beyonce had for Beychella, but I don’t think I could be mistaken for Beyonce, not as easy like these Ari impersonators can. This is a long winded way of saying Ari’s look is basic lmao."
2269,2020-04-30 17:30:18,gaxc03,"Watched *Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga* on Netflix and it was super cute, might be a Top 10 film for me now. It fell into that trap of being a movie about gay rights where the actual gay people are low-key props and a straight man saves the day but it was so well handled and smartly written that I don't mind that much. Like, that scene during the play where >!the little girl is trapped in the box begging to get out and then the father jumps onstage and beats up the actor who was going to hit his daughter!< was so powerful, and the comedy was great too. I wish it had had a banger in it though, I liked the songs but that would have put it over the edge.

And it also just made me like... proud to be LGBT+? Like, with how online our lives are these days sometimes it feels like being gay is just like, performative and all about these superficial things like fashion, flamboyance, lingo, terminology, cattiness, stanning icons, but at the end of the day knowing at my core that I'm capable of loving another human being like I am and that this connects me to a whole community of people all around the world, many of whom are still fighting to have the privilege of living openly and freely... that's powerful stuff.

Also! Glad to finally be done with my 2017 series of posts, it was fun but a lot of those things were written between the hours of midnight and 2:00 so now I can get some sleep. It really was a great year, but when I asked my friend what her favorite albums of the year were she said ""fuck that was so long ago"" and now I feel old. I'll be collecting them into their own masterposts in a few days but I have other posts I have to write before then because I put WAY too much time into this sub. It's nice to have a hobby I guess.

On a less fun note my neighbors have put in window boxes and so now I can't open my window without it triggering my allergies, and it just started to get really hot here. Good thing I'm moving in a month!"

The look on these peoples facing when they have to tip-toe around it on the floor made me feel so disgusting, like is this really the home I’ve grown up in? And what’s worst is my grandma refuses to throw them away, especially when all of these stuff are old, rusty and filled with rat dropping so we can’t even use them.

#Top 5 Albums I Liked But I Thought Were Too Popular For Me To Call “Underrated”



Title | Schpiel | Song
---|---|----
5. [***Witness* by Katy Perry**](https://open.spotify.com/album/0UlbGi4oAth8s6rwaGSU8Z?si=p2mQzzLHSoWKVg0EBNVRtw) | Yes, this album. Mostly I’m just nostalgic for it because I went to see her on tour and it was my first ever pop concert and it was an insanely good show, but also I think that pop fans gave this one a raw deal. So much was made about this album being a flop and Katy being embarrassing while promoting it I think a lot of people were never going to concede that the album was, in fact, good. The writing on this album is surprisingly honest and emotional in that trademark “Katy” way and the production is immaculate. While neither the “*Teenage Dream* part II” that fans wanted nor the “purposeful pop” album that Katy wanted, it did succeed in liberating Katy from her old Dr. Luke crafted sound and creating something that still sounds current, and I find the themes of self-reflection/discovery to be very poignant. It maybe wasn’t the album we wanted in 2017, but on reflection I think it was the one we needed. | [""Act My Age""](https://youtu.be/bTGVgAOFDlM) is one of her best songs ever and should have been a single!
4. [***Freudian* by Daniel Caesar**](https://open.spotify.com/album/3xybjP7r2VsWzwvDQipdM0?si=r3cRRJakQh-9hRB2FTL4kw) | Daniel Caesar’s gospel-tinged r&b album saw a lot of critical buzz but it didn’t become the household name I thought it should have, which is a shame because it’s damn good. While there are a few genuine hits on here, for the most part it’s an intimate, subtle experience that relies on gentle production and the soul of the singers to explore themes of love and religion. He sings with such warmth and tenderness about being grateful for the women in his life and it’s touching to hear, not to mention gorgeous on a musical level. While I don’t really spin this album on repeat (it’s kind of heavy to approach) the sheer craft of it has stuck with me from the first listen. Daniel Caesar absolutely struck gold with this album, I can totally see this album becoming a genre classic if it isn’t already. | [""We Find Love/Blessed""](https://youtu.be/BJC8wkXirz4) are my two favorite songs on the album and he performs them so pretty!
3. [***Glasshouse* by Jessie Ware**](https://open.spotify.com/album/6mPNjjOl2GHbP4E90l7bJe?si=t73YYgK1QM6DaVpYyh9opg) | One of the freshest pop albums of 2017 was an adult contemporary album about marriage and motherhood, so I don’t want to hear any of you ever complaining about “mom pop” again. Jessie Ware’s voice is like a razor that slices to your heart with expert precision: she can coo gently, she can bring a husky energy, she can belt, she does it all and she does it with *soul*. She can write a hell of a song too, and she created such an album that feels sweeping in its intimacy. The lyrics of this album *hit*, and her honesty and emotional vulnerability transcend the songwriting and bleed into the production, which always cradles her perfectly and elevates the songs to perfection. Ware recently expressed disappointment with this album, saying that it was off-the-mark for her target audience, and while I understand that perspective I’m still glad that this is the album that we got. | [""Your Domino""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwJit35ewFM) is unbelievably slick pop perfection.
2. [***The Click* by AJR**](https://open.spotify.com/album/51iPchT1rPmDNT5FYGoPn5?si=0oIkt-ZbQBODoDQ92Xkf5A) | I stumbled across this album when scrolling through Spotify’s New Music Friday and I clicked on it because I thought the cover was cute and it absolutely blew me away from start to finish. Turns out all the critics hated it, but I can’t for the life of me understand why! It’s the perfect picture of what it’s like to be a messy, overeager but terrified twenty-something trying to figure out their place in the world, which means sometimes it’s weird or awkward, but that’s just part of the charm. Their no-holds-barred electro pop sound is brimming with an energy and a personality that makes the songs easy and fun to listen to, and their theatrical sensibilities serve to give them a bit of extra punch. One of the defining albums of the year for me. | [""The Good Part""](https://youtu.be/Il5Lk3vyhlg) is a mood.
1. [***Unapologetically* by Kelsea Ballerini**](https://open.spotify.com/album/7Ht6xQ80vFtSe2n2KjAAsA?si=UOzHKF59TXajs3KdVXoEtQ) | Technically [I featured a song from this](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/g3oxf5/daily_discussion_april_18_2020/fnst4qz/) but the album itself was actually my #1 of the year so I figured I’d mention it again. Tracking her journey from a broken heart to finding new love, Kelsea hits every single step on the path brilliantly. Sadness, anger, nostalgia, the rush of new love, even those moments where you aren’t thinking about love at all and are just finding yourself, they’re all mapped out beautifully in her radio friendly country-pop songs. Every single track on this album feels important and is interesting in its own right, it’s a damn near flawless album that I can’t praise highly enough. | [""Unapologetically""](https://youtu.be/lLFqK3PUS7w) is just an explosion of feel-good lovestruck energy."

im using cakewalk after getting tired of how bad tracktion was, but cakewalk doesnt have the option to render or reverse single sounds :( if it does i cant find those. its kinda annoying, so im eyeing soundbridge which is also free. if it doesnt have a reverse feature im gonna just be content with the shortcircuit sampler's reverse feature but god its tiring to try to get the timing right over and over."

I lost about 20 hours of work I put into making those playlists. I’m literally beat red and shaking mad. I made those playlists last week and playlists I made today are literally fine. I cannot make sense of this. Currently re-signing in again hoping that fixes things.

Edit: spent 45 minutes on the phone with Apple support and they couldn’t make sense of it either. I honestly don’t know where to start to fix these. Like just start from scratch or try to find just the missing songs? By dozens I guess I mean roughly 600 songs are gone. Hopefully I can find the pattern of which songs it removed and this won’t be that bad."
2286,2020-04-30 15:20:42,gaxc03,"Been thinking about Harry Styles dressing in a gender-fluid way. What could that be about?

2302,2020-04-30 17:28:26,gaxc03,"My guess is the younger crowd didn't experience it in real time so they don't know the real impact. So they brush it off. 

I see here a lot it when people discuss legacy artists like The Beatles, they get relegated to ""dusty old white guys."" And it's just ??????


Also the subs unhealthy infatuation with you're a flop if you get anything besides a #1."
2303,2020-04-30 18:40:57,gaxc03,"I think it's because over time, the history of a certain time period tends to get oversimplified. For example, influences tend to get boiled down to some nice clean narrative, albums that aren't seen as classics or influential culturally are forgotten, and for artists if you aren't *the* most iconic person in a specific scene or if the scene you were in isn't seen as exciting/worth mentioning, you don't get the legacy you deserve. 

I think in Kesha's case it doesn't help that the context in which her most popular material was made may understandably make people uncomfortable listening to it and people may also feel uncomfortable hyping it up due to who will be profiting off of it."
2304,2020-04-30 17:28:19,gaxc03,"Avril was huge for 2-3 years almost 20 years ago and has released nothing but plodding 5 minute ballads since then.

Anything But Ordinary will always be a jam."

2316,2020-04-30 17:10:37,gaxc03,"Me too! Went back to The Family Jewels and Froot. I still think that TFJ is her best and legitimately a 10/10 album. I really miss the old Marina.

Really like Electra Heart too. Many people say that it sounds dated, but I don't feel the ""dateness"" at all. Maybe it was the energy/vocals/melody/lyrics combo that are very unique to Marina; that extra ingredient to make the album feel way more unique that the typical 2012 EDM bangers."

Resentment is truly the only son on the record that connects with me in any way. Even her collab with Ke$ha wasn't even that Ke$ha-y, and that was a major bummer.

I really wanted to like the record, but I couldn't."

2339,2020-04-30 19:44:40,gaxc03,"I refuse to believe (edit: a large part of) what's happening to her is anyone's fault other than her label. RCA is just trash. You would think that Normani would finally be the black popular that wanted to make Tinashe so bad, but either they or someone specific behind the scenes are basically trying to sabotage her by now. Megan Thee Stallion, even before she was going through label issues, still managed to release a mixtape and an EP, and Normani has been in the industry way longer than her (I am only using MTS in this because Diamonds was technically Normani's last song). RCA can't even give Normani a mini-album? They can't even have her release some dance/vocal covers (edit: granted, Normani could also be doing this just by herself)?

The album's probably been done by now, but for some reason, they don't want to release it or even anything connected to it, since I don't think Motivation was supposed to be a lead or even promo single. Waves is almost 2 years old, and DWAS looks like it's going to be a stand-alone now. They've been fucking up at least since scrapping promotions for the Calvin Harris singles in order to promote Waves, and then not releasing the MV until months after the song had been released."

2347,2020-04-30 17:40:56,gaxc03,I think it might go into the top ten plus the remix only got just under 2 days of tracking and the top 5 is really competitive. I do hope it can get at least to #5 but the song has done really well on the charts regardless

2355,2020-04-30 16:43:05,gaxc03,"You can choose whatever words you feel comfortable with to describe your sexuality, and it's not surprising that certain words have negative connotations for certain people.

But I do think it's important that we allow space marginalized groups to reclaim words that were used as slurs against them and flip them into a more positive connotation. It's similar to how some gay men use 'faggot/fag' to describe themselves, or how the n-word has been repurposed in AAVE."
2356,2020-04-30 16:44:10,gaxc03,"i don't like it either. i see nothing wrong with lgbt people wanting to reclaim that slur, but i don't want anyone to call me it because its literal definition is ""strange; odd"". i sideye any non-lgbt person who uses it because it *is* still a slur used against a group you aren't a part of.

label yourself whatever feels comfortable and don't let anyone tell you that you have to accept being called a slur to be ""woke"" or whatever."

2402,2020-04-30 20:35:21,gaxc03,"She DOES has a distinct look--thats why she's being copied. We associate Ariana so strongly with a certain aesthetic (the high pony, the long sweaters, the eyeliner, the big brown eyes), so they know that anyone who adopts this look can pass as Ariana because that's where our mind immediately goes.

Also, everyone has look-a-likes. There are Angelina Jolie, Beyonce, Billie Eilish, etc. lookalikes. It's not difficult to find people who can resemble another person via makeup/hair/styling choices."
2403,2020-04-30 21:08:52,gaxc03,"Pretty sure she's being copied BECAUSE she has such a distinctive look. Any random skinny girl things she can put on thigh high boots, oversized sweaters and put their hair in a ponytail and think they look like Ariana Grande. 

The recent debacle with Jeopardy and Janet Jackson also proves how iconic Ariana's look has already become."
2404,2020-04-30 20:32:33,gaxc03,I think Ari has a distinct look. Like anyone you see with a high ponytail and boots you instantly think Ariana. Ask that jeopardy guy who thought that Janet Jackson was Ariana lol.

Not sure who would make the perfect combo still 🤔

Shoutout to Brooklynn’s song Mystic Woman that captures the sappho earth witch vibe I get from the Hex Girls with a Beyonce twist! She also has a song called Blissed Out that not only sounds like Katy Perry but sounds like what Katy was trying to do with the NRO/ST/HIH era."

Actually, let me rephrase that. 

If she could get a Bad Blood style remix of The Man with one of the MANY female rappers that are blowing the fuck up right now, I would stan forever and maybe the song might repeak. 

I hate that I came up with this, because now I really want it."

The closest I can think of is the outfit he wore to the Met gala, but that was a costume party with a camp theme. Pretty much everything else that turns up in a search for ""Harry Styles gender fluid"" or ""Harry Styles queer baiting"" is just him wearing brightly coloured men's shirts or suits with loud patterns. They're not hyper masculine clothes but they're still pretty clearly men's clothes, and definitely not anything that's out of place on a rock/pop star. What am I missing?"

2436,2020-04-30 16:11:07,gaxc03,i think that he is really like that to an extent but marketing and queerbaiting definitely plays into it. i also think that his fans heavily exaggerate how feminine and flamboyantly he dresses to push this idea of him being an anti-toxic masculinity groundbreaking woke king. he never really dresses that flamboyantly outside of wearing like... florals and pink.
2437,2020-04-30 15:31:11,gaxc03,I think it’s queerbaiting. I’m also sick of straight guys like him getting lauded for dressing in a ‘gender non-conforming’ way when queer guys get abused for it.

This is really what it is. I’m in my early 20s and i don’t really remember Avril ever being this huge popstar like OP is saying. I know her big hits (Skater boi, complicated, girlfriend), but for the most part i’ve only ever viewed her as an artist with a couple big hits and moderate success in the early 2000s. I would compare it to how teens view Katy Perry now. I know for a fact that she was massive in 2010 because i experienced it personally and I’ll always see her that way because of it l, but teens now only see her a popstar with a few hits."

2520,2020-04-30 22:28:24,gaxc03,"Oh it’s just really lame, and immature drama. I use to have a very close tight group of friends, I’m good at putting group together and connecting people, most I’ve known since I was a kid. Especially my best friend, C. In High School, our group all fell apart and then I unintentionally went M.I.A, turns out I was depressed... From the other friends backstabbing me. Blah, blah - basically she messaged me one day saying she missed me, and started just going above and beyond in our friendship which she normally doesn’t do, FaceTiming, being extra clingy. Asking where I went, same with her family.

Anyways, she’s friends with my former group of friend, including my guy friend. My other friend from the friend group re-entered my life (A, not C), after she made the mistake of going to a different country for a music festival and they held it against her because she didn’t tell anyone, painting her as some sort of awful, toxic person. Which she isn’t.

Anyways, that friend tried to make everything good to get the group that fell apart together, and apologized to them personally, but they would crap talk her behind her backs, which I didn’t think was fair.

I ended up choosing her side, instead of being neutral. I realized my childhood bestie, and guy bestie, are the toxic fake ones. So, I ghosted them.

When she came back, it made me also re-evaluate my friendship with those people. Even though I “buried” the hatchet and told her she didn’t have to apologize to me, I realized I still cannot forget all the things they did to me. (Call me a gold digger, untrue, call me ugly, allow someone who I don’t even know, and interact with me call my family unintelligent, despite my family being lawyers, try to set me up in a scenario where I could’ve wounded up dead, literally.) I could go on. 

Even though I stopped liking their photos, opening their snaps, so-on. They would send me shade, and or use their Snap stories they never use snap stories before even use to shade throw and target me when they’re in a group of former friends of mine. I still didn’t open it or reply. 

They would always check my stories, right away and the guy friend would add my Spotify songs to his car playlist.

That’s about it. It’s so, so stupid and embarrassing, nothing hot. I went from missing these people and being heart broken and regretting it so bad for months, losing too many pounds in a week cause of it, and now I just realized I’m over it. They can thrive without me, I’m just glad I’m free."

2523,2020-04-30 22:51:25,gaxc03,"Avril wasn't nearly as big as OP is making her out to be. If I had to sum up her career she had a few big hits, then many songs which did ""okay"". As far as IMPACT goes, Avril had just about none. Kesha was much more of a force than Avril. She was also like an antithesis to Gaga at the time. Gaga was on another level with artistry, but her music was thumping pop/club songs. Kesha, by comparison, was doing very similar music but... dirty? Her whole thing was trash-chic. Her music and videos were strictly fun. And she did make an impact on music at large with that."

I usually just stick to Lindt or Ghirardelli to stay on the cheaper side of the spectrum. But I'm a big fan of Lindt's 90% cacao, and Ghirardelli's 86% and their 72% cacao. On the regular though, I usually just get Lindt's chili bar, the perfect amount of heat in that thing. 


I did do Raaka's First Nibs program for about half a year. Got some really neat stuff from them. Had a bananas foster one time, blew my mind. If I buy from them, I usually get the bourbon cask aged.

And also, she would sing part of the bridge, and I can her growling on “I love you, ain’t that the worst thing you ever heard?”

They have a bacon chocolate bar (which is very good but I still prefer [Vosges’ bacon bar](https://www.vosgeschocolate.com/collections/bacon-chocolate), but Chuao’s is much cheaper!), a potato chip bar, pretzel bars, they’re all great - especially the honeycomb.

-when a guy writes about break ups and exes, he’s vulnerable; when a girl does it, she’s being Whiney. Sexism much? 

Half of the songs in the industry are about break ups. It’s called art. Artists deal with pain with their art. 

-emotionally abusive is a loaded accusation. Can I please have some examples of the times Taylor has “emotionally abused” others? 


Honestly, Taylor swift has probably had the LEAST problematic career of any current pop star - she’s done absolutely nothing to hurt anyone nor has she done anything offensively wrong (publically). People like you just like to hate on successful people.

One day when we could all go to gyms still I was listening to In This Moment's *Blood* and Adrenalize came on. Instantly I wanted to listen to Adrenaline by both Simple Creatures and Shinedown. I then decided I wanted to create a workout playlist around that theme. The idea fell on it's face right away and it just became songs I was digging at the current moment. 

It straddles a weird line of both popheads friendly and not. It has some popheads favorites on it like Don't Start Now, but then also we have some metalcore on it. 

Funny enough though, I've learned recently that as much as I love the hard in your face 90% screaming 10% clean vocals metalcore that doesn't motivate me to work out at all, so yeah it's almost like a baby's first hardrock/posthardcore/metalcore playlist in a way too. It's a weird mix, but it motivates me and I guess that is all that matters. 

And the funny thing is I don't actually like everything here, like I said it just motivates me. Towards the end there is a newer Asking Alexandria song and I don't actively listen to it, but it just works real well when running or on my bike.

Fun fact: Silversun Pickups Lazy Eye makes me workout way too hard, and it's funny cause it isn't the most intense song on the list. It just makes me go."

#[*Video Game Hero* by **Barbie**](https://open.spotify.com/album/4QChVOmas7doj7uWgdP7BL?si=iFYl1jBoSeywWo7-FlH84Q)

**Genre/Length:** Electropop / 14 Minutes

* **For Fans Of:** *Sucker* by Charli XCX, soundtracks to children’s movies

**Description:** This was actually the *last* direct to video Barbie movie (they’ve shifted their attention over to her Netflix show now) and while that makes me sad, I’m at least glad the series could go out on such a high note. *Video Game Hero* was a great film with a great soundtrack, fittingly tapping into an electropop/dance sound that goes surprisingly hard. As you’d expect from the soundtrack to a direct to video Barbie film the songs are a sugar rush designed to hype up young girls, and I wouldn’t have it any other way. Though a little faceless, they make up for it in pep, and though formulaic, they make up for it with fun. I can’t pretend that this album is in any way highbrow but I also can’t deny that it’s enjoyable, and we could all use a little bit of unironic positive affirmation every now and then. : )

**Positives:** Nonstop energy, super peppy

**Potential Barriers:** For children

> **Sample Track:** [“Power Up”](https://youtu.be/Sl7lrGuJknQ) has a really fun instrumental.

---

> [**”All The Way”** by **Ledisi**](https://youtu.be/wC_413xkw_4)

Ledisi is one of those people who’s big in the r&b/soul sphere that runs perpendicular to the pop scene but doesn’t quite make the area of intersection, which is a shame because she’s golden voiced and releases great music. This sprawling, five minute long soul track netted her a Grammy nomination and it’s not hard to hear why. It’s about the desire for an all encompassing love that loves her “all the way,” complete with a delicate string arrangement and that slow burn classic drum/piano, and she sells the hell out of it. It’s the kind of overly romantic song that usually gets labelled as wedding fodder, but when it sounds this pristine that’s not even pejorative."

20 minutes until i get out and go on a little cruise on my bike. did 25 miles yesterday, in 2 sessions, so i'm gonna take it easy today. maybe do 6 miles for my lunch ride, and then after work maybe hit up 10 miles. but if those numbers don't happen i won't be mad. not gonna try to spin hard either, just a nice ride in the nice weather, maybe ride my cruise bike instead of my hybrid

thank u and have a blessed day"

If it was an announcement about an engagement or secret wedding, I wouldn't even care since they've been on/off so many times 💀 ... but they're really about to bring a whole baby into this world. Wow. 

I guess part of me is ""upset"" as a stan, since wbk they don't have the healthiest relationship (plus gigi and her team have been pretty ugly to zayn w/ their tabloid gossip while they broke up, whereas zayn had always been praising her) and now with a baby, they're basically always gonna be in eachother's life no matter what lol. But I'm also reflecting on my own life and while I really don't have any desire to raise a family, I feel weirdly behind in life (in that particular family aspect), which I normally wouldn't care about at all?? idk just wanted to vent somewhere.

Also kinda hilarious how zayn stans missed the hints from the pics of her double bday party/apparent baby shower. People spent time analyzing ears, hair spirals, the shitty reflections on balloons ... just trying to spot zayn 😭"
2691,2020-04-29 21:06:38,gab5bt,"Ok since yesterday I've listened to [Voicenotes by Charlie Puth](https://open.spotify.com/album/0mZIUXje90JtHxPNzWsJNR?si=un5Dh8urQLG-n0R3tLwB2w) because beforehand the only Charlie Puth songs I knew were Marvin Gaye (not gonna lie it's gentrification personified and lacks ANY originality but I still find it paletteably cute) and See You Again (meh) and not gonna lie I actually like it a lot! 

My favourite songs from the album are definitely Attention and Done For Me. I don't think it's a stellar album, and a lot of the songs kinda mush into one (sound kinda same-y), but hot damn the production of it was the selling point for me - his voice is kinda bland but not bad, but the instrumentation/production carries it massively. Although not on the album, Mother also shares that quality ansd I like it too! Plus I looked up that he produced Small Talk by Katy Perry (which I also like a lot) and I gotta say I'm liking him a lot rn

2694,2020-04-29 19:23:57,gab5bt,"I don't know if I'm just too dumb to fully immerse myself into a slow-paced tv show's universe or those tv shows are just vastly overrated. 

I started Ozark once the latest season dropped and completed it yesterday. I decided to check out the subreddit to see other's thoughts and saw a post about someone's fitbit tracking their heart rate beating fast while watching the show that left me confused. Overall it seems like people are impressed by the third season, while I found the show's quality dropped after the first season and the third was *too* slow and overall a drag to get through. It was predictable and I was unable to give a shit what happened to any of these characters because I just find the writing to be lacking. 

This is very common with me though. I just find tv shows aren't even worth the effort to watch anymore. The quality always drops after season one, character depth is always thrown to the side in place of sex scenes and kill-offs, and lately every single tv show seems to think slow-burn pacing = better quality but they lack the detail to pull it off. 

I've been trying to find a good show to watch but I'm just so put off by the fact that every show that is critically praised or commercially popular seems to involve rape and/or objectification of female nudity for the male gaze and/or gory murder and glorified violence. If I watch something PG-13, any semblance of a great story is ruined by a mandatory lust-at-first-sight plotline. Don't even get me started on ""feminist"" tv shows that reuse every single misogynist trope yet think they're progressive because they add a black side character. 

Maybe I just watched way too many tv shows to the point that nothing in the genres I mainly consume can seem fresh. I think I fall into the trap of comparing everything new to the best of the old. Or like I said previously, I'm too dumb to really understand them. I do have an insecurity of feeling like I lack intelligence because I struggle to understand what people are talking about sometimes and that issue happens when I read novels as well. Sometimes there is a disconnect between my brain and whatever I'm focusing on, so I can't truly tell if my criticisms can be valid if I'm just completely missing the point. 

I guess to sum it all up, I don't like tv shows anymore.  It saddens me because I was big into fandom tumblr before it died and found a lot of joy in it. I keep losing hobbies without picking up new ones. ☹"

Both are also pretty heavy smokers..It just doesn't seem like either of them are in the best mental or physical condition to raise a baby.

It’s a prequel series to Breaking Bad that has its own distinct style which is somewhat slow-paced at first in the early seasons but is constantly engaging and filled with (sometimes dark) humor. But it’s very detailed and careful with the way things unfold for each character’s arc, and it never devolves into misogynistic or overly sexualized tropes...in fact I’d say one of its main characters is probably among the most well-written and nuanced female characters on TV right now. 

It’s currently on its fifth season and I’d say the quality has only gotten better over time. You also don’t need to watch Breaking Bad first to watch BCS, if you’ve yet to see that one either."
2772,2020-04-30 09:20:57,gab5bt,"hi i love tv and understand a lottttt of what you’re saying right now. let me give you a few recs!

succession is imo the best show on tv right now. interesting characters, NO reliance on female nudity (rare for an HBO show especially), and i genuinely feel like every episode has been engaging through the two seasons out so far!

derry girls is a really fun show on netflix about irish teenagers in the 90s. again no female nudity, and every episode has been great. i was in tears by the end of season two because i loved the main characters so much!

reccing derry girls reminded me that pen15 on hulu is super fun. only one season so far but it’s about american teens in the 90s now haha! still a comedy but different topics than derry girls for sure.

the night of was a really great miniseries on hbo that may fit your criteria as well, it has some violence but i wouldn’t say it glorifies it - it’s ultimately about racial profiling and how the american prison system is incredibly broken.

those are just some recs i feel like might fit your criteria - i apologize if you’ve seen them before! i think television right now is better than its ever been...but also some of it is not as great as people say. like ozark. 😶

i hope you like some of these!"
2773,2020-04-29 17:43:37,gab5bt,"Honestly, once you hit your late 20s, let alone 30s I feel like it's impossible to tell how old someone is in the 17-21 range, don't let it make you feel bad.

21 may feel so old and awful from where you are now but 17 is closer to 21 than I am to 21 🙃"

For the record I’m 30 and nearly everyone at work has guessed me to be 19-21 lol"

You're lucky tbh. I was recently mistaken for a sophomore in high school; I'm a junior in university lmao

edit: also you're so pretty!"

Like when I'm listening to free Spotify it's basically all ads for Premium and seemingly no actual paid advertisements. Maybe once a week there'll be an ad for a playlist sponsored by Trident Gum or some shit, and ads for companies and services outside of Spotify are even rarer. Is that just because I'm not in a main market so there aren't many advertisers targeting me, or is it the same for everyone?"

As for why, I think its a biological instinct or something. The biggest, buffest guys were the ones who could provide the most for their families in the caveman era."

I'm so excited to see where Sally Rooney's career takes off, the writing was impeccable. I've been meaning to get in the queue for her first novel, Conversations with Friends, but other books have occupied my time."

I'm so upset that in NJ all state and county parks are closed, so many trails I love I can't ride right now. I mean I know I can go and ride em, but I really don't feel like dealing with the outcome if I do get stopped by someone. 

THOUGH, on the other hand, I have this weird little quirk, I guess you can call it that, when I encounter a circle or cul-de-sac I go around it twice. I've never been able to do it on most of the big circles due to traffic, but with everyone staying home I've hit up complete roundabouts. It's the little things sometimes."

But I also listen to other genres where the acoustic would shine, and I love making stripped back versions of songs. Right now I’ve been working on stripped back versions of Lana’s Love and Happiness Is A Butterfly. They sound *good* on my classical but an acoustic would have much more sustain, making it sound better."
2813,2020-04-29 17:17:00,gab5bt,"She apparently did an interview the other day saying something along the lines of ""one day I'll start raising a family and leave modeling behind"", so I don't know how serious she is about that ...  but there's still supermodels out there doing their thing after becoming moms, so I don't think she'll struggle too bad to go back if she wanted to. Yeah I know her mom used to be making all sorts of comments to her about having to watch what she eats for the sake of her modeling career. She does this schtick whenever she goes on Fallon, where they eat burgers ... which is idk, a lot of models/girls in general do that cutesy ""look i love food"" thing with burgers/pizza/etc, so let's not speculate too much. I didn't know she's a ""heavy"" smoker though.

I think they'll be great parents but I just think its a little bizarre to decide to become parents when the relationship hasn't been stable, and she literally got pregnant when they reunited like a month after her fling with that one guy from The Bachelor."

Plus, considering how rocky their relationship was, having a baby isn't necessarily going to magically fix everything, you know? I'm sure they'd be great parents/co-parents though."

2828,2020-04-29 18:06:50,gab5bt,"I think with Boys Will Be Boys removed and a few tracks switched around, Good In Bed acts as a really welcome curveball for Future Nostalgia's sound. I think people underestimate the value of something that doesn't quite ""fit"" in making a more rewarding whole."

2834,2020-04-29 16:28:03,gab5bt,"disagree. there are tons of masc openly gay men and being straight definitely doesn’t equal more masc or manly than gay men. 

tons of straight women thirst over more feminine men. see louis and harry, dan and phil, troye sivan, timothee chalamet, conan grey, that entire brand of youtubers like joey graceffa and tyler oakley a few years back that had so many thirsty fangirls, etc."
2835,2020-04-29 18:56:42,gab5bt,No offence but a lot of pop boys don't necessarily fit into the standard of hyper masculinity (which is a good thing I feel) so how does that work?
2836,2020-04-29 18:20:59,gab5bt,"It's honestly really good! The only thing is that maybe reverb could be a little less stronger, and the mix on the beat overpowers the vocals.

2846,2020-04-29 16:46:05,gab5bt,"I didn’t mean that I think gay = femme and masc = straight, I just assumed when they said ‘straight’ they meant masc. Because otherwise their comment would be pretty irrelevant. 

I don’t think any of those men are mainstream sex icons, except maybe Harry. And wearing nail polish and ruffley shirts sometimes doesn’t really make him that feminine. 

I don’t think some random people on tumblr are very representative of the majority of women. For every woman who is attracted to Joey Graceffa or is a Larry shipper there’s probably 100 who are into Brad Pitt or Leonardo DiCaprio. I don’t think you’re in touch with the America that named Blake Shelton the Sexiest Man Alive a couple years ago. There’s always going to be niche subsets of the population into feminine guys, but that applies to both gay men and women. 

I don’t like the fact that gay guys are pressured to not be masc4masc when women are never questioned for being femme4masc."

I was so perplexed. I was like no way he did that with kickpower only. 

Then a few days later I saw him out when I was on a walk and then I noticed the motor and all. 

But kid is on that thing every single day zipping around the neighborhood. I kind of want one now."

2854,2020-04-29 18:45:46,gab5bt,"no that makes sense. i don't have synesthesia but i definitely to some extent associate colours and textures with music for example, most of future nostalgia feels like a dark pink, and good in bed follows that. dsn, cool and boys will be boys are the only ones that really stray from that

but yeah more on the topic haha, like what u/vagenda said i think if dua say took out boys will be boys and added a few tracks, if it ain't me, cherry and love is religion in my ideal world, i think the album would be improved so much cohesively and quality wise"

It's fine, I don't think he sees it as an even minor issue, keeping the mood good, and employees happy with each other is part of their job as well. Phrasing it that way could make a tiny bit better environment, obviously, depending on what's your relationship with your co-workers is already. 

The original response is blunt, and to the point, there are many ways to phrase it and they all can be fine."

To be honest the main reason I don't ride it all that often anymore is that mine can go fast enough to be seriously dangerous (~28mph), so I wear protective gear, but the summers get so hot and humid here I never wanna get suited up. Same reason I don't have a motorcycle (yet?), I'm a wimp when it comes to getting sweaty."

*I also forgot to mention— and of no harm to you—your image resembles my last significant other whom passed away, a tragic affair. It’s interesting to peer your music list and attempt to construct any resemblance of her persona throughout the art works.*"
2881,2020-06-25 17:28:29,hfb0yc,"That Insecure reference is hilarious, good job."
2882,2020-06-25 15:12:49,hfb0yc,"I was curious to see what you labeled “the midnight” as, but I don’t see them on your list! 😔"

2884,2020-06-26 16:56:03,hfb0yc,"Honestly, 1975 is not indie or alternative rock, although people always seem to want to classify them as such. They're indie pop at best, but really more pop rock. Also Tame Impala is 100% psychedelic rock."
2885,2020-06-24 22:48:46,hfb0yc,"Nice divisions. It's crazy that Yves Tumor can be labeled a psych rock act now. I mean, it totally works, but these used to be this hard to pin down, experimental, electronic rock nightmare."
2886,2020-06-25 16:22:48,hfb0yc,Definitely Synthwave is the only descriptor. I think maybe some electronic categories would be better on here.

2888,2020-06-26 19:05:00,hfb0yc,"I think you're right and I can adjust accordingly, or at least put The 1975 under pop rock. The 1975 and Tame Impala are for sure among the toughest to categorize correctly, since they span so much.

Tame Impala's earlier stuff is for sure psych rock,  but the last two albums have evolved to a sound that you wouldn't necessarily say to someone who was looking to listen to psych rock- ""oh check out the latest from Tame Impala."""
2889,2020-06-25 16:32:02,hfb0yc,"I wasn’t sure if they would make a whole category for one band. If I go next year, it’ll be solely to see the midnight, everything else will be a bonus."

2906,2020-06-24 15:47:04,hf11t5,">Yes, I’m bitter. Go away. 

Oh. My. Gods. 

Girl, I FEEL you.

It is 20 minutes to 9 am where I am. I have not slept since roughly 4 pm yesterday. Know why? Because only lazy people are night owls and naturally have a sleep schedule that lends itself to graveyard shifts. Therefore, since I was lazy and asleep during the day yesterday, I must now be awake to accomplish The Things. Despite the fact that there are no Things to accomplish because oh, I don't know, *we're in the middle of a goddamn pandemic and there is no work and nowhere to go*!!!

But because my parents insisted that normal people are awake at 9 am every-fucking-morning and that not being up at that hour was lazy and unproductive...here I am. With my computer, sore eyes, a headache, and a healthy daily dose of massive anxiety and depression spiked with insomnia. Innit FUN? 

Cognitively I am fully aware that there is nothing I can do, and nothing to do. I have hashed out a contingency plan for the job market crash brought on by the pandemic that won't kick in for a couple of months. I have nowhere to go because (again) pandemic. And I still cannot force my thought processes back to something resembling sanity, and not a sleep-deprived hamster on Speed, because I can hear my parents in the back of my head."
2907,2020-06-24 14:59:28,hf11t5,"I love how accusations of selfishness are such a go-to for people who are upset because you're not giving them *your fucking money*. 

Do they really have no self-awareness?  Or do they think that the buttons they programmed into us are that powerful we won't notice the dissonance there?  

Regardless, I'm glad to see you've got a healthy appreciation of the fact that being concerned for your own interests, what I call a healthy level of selfishness, is a good thing.  

I'm so sorry to hear how bad things were with your medical ills, and I hope you've found a Dx and treatement program that's helping you, now. 

-Rat"
2908,2020-06-24 16:09:13,hf11t5,"I don’t have much to add other than I really hope your medical story ends with figuring out what was ailing you, it was fixed, and now you’re healthy, feel amazing, and have a wonderful job that you love again. 

Also, I wanted to jump on the “you’re an amazing writer” train - I would love to read any work you do (since you mentioned maybe writing on the side), but I’m glad you’re writing on a sub I follow."
2909,2020-06-24 19:48:57,hf11t5,"I don't remember exactly where the quote is from, but it went something like this:

""you know when you try to tell someone they have a piece of dirt on their face, right THERE, and they go ""WHERE?""  HERE? touching six different places on their face, and you just wanna SLAP the bastard?! ""

It's how this makes me feel. I just want to SLAP that bitch back into the dinosaur age, and wish her well with surviving there. On her own. Good luuuhuuuuck.

Whew. I truly hope she got her comeuppance.

Ps: it took me over ten years to get my Crohns diagnosis, and several psychologists were convinced my constant cramps and diarrhea were between my ears. They even convinced ME of that fact. I worked SO hard in therapy and it never got any better... I got blamed for that too. Until my diagnosis. Do you think I EVER got an apology?

I STILL feel like they should lose their licenses."
2910,2020-06-24 16:05:00,hf11t5,"Your writing style is awesome and I love that you used the word ""dreamt.""  I use it too and never hear it anywhere else.

How are you feeling these days?  I'm sure the NC has helped your stress levels, at least.  You're among friends here!"
2911,2020-06-24 22:10:52,hf11t5,"First of all, you're a great writer and I want to thank you for making me belly laugh. As a black woman living through june 2020 this hasn't happened to me in a minute. 

There are so many things in your posts that I can relate to. 
I have struggled with a chronic disease since I was 15 and it has significantly derailed my life plans in my 20s. I feel your pain and hope your health is more manageable these days. 

Also as one of Those Kids, I relate so hard to the instructions part. I know my logic isn't necessarily everyone's logic and after years of expecting people to do things the right way (read: my way) I have relented and now try to give people instructions that are crystal clear. It's exhausting and it riles me up everytime I make the effort to detail everything and people still fuck it up.  

As for your mom... it seems like she can't stand you deviating for her perfect plan of you being her savings account and she doesn't deserve shit. 

My english isn't bad at all but just in case, non native english speaker disclaimer."
2912,2020-06-24 14:51:55,hf11t5,"You are so much more patient than I would have been. Especially when ill. My bullshit quotient is very low, to begin with, particularly with family. They know how I am and usually don't embellish for effect because I am very blunt and expect the same. Guilt does not work on me. I don't work on the barter system. Any sacrifices made raising me are paid forward, not backward.

You are 100% right for taking care of yourself first. She should be ashamed of trying to take advantage when you are ill and looking for a diagnosis/treatment. I hope you are feeling better and healing."
2913,2020-06-24 22:00:58,hf11t5,Your mom and my grandma sound alike about the food. I do have Crohn’s and she can’t wrap her head around my diet. I cannot eat high fiber foods. It rips me apart inside and puts me in terrible pain. But her logic is that salad is healthy and everyone should eat salad and therefore I should eat salad to be healthy. And then judges my plate of meat and potatoes that I can actually eat.
2914,2020-06-24 22:35:49,hf11t5,"Have you been tested for POTS? I just ask because the symptoms sound similar to those of friends with the disorder. I’m so sorry you’re so sick. I know how you feel. I hope your health gets to a tolerable level soon—and that your mother stays out of your damn house. <3

You’re a fantastic writer, btw!"

MCU ... and Shuri is cool (oldish woman, was in the ‘y0 the sole female pupil in a technical year... worked long in a technical profession)

I am proud of you for saying no to your mother and I hope you are happy and have your medical issues figured out now. Maybe you don't need validation from an internet stranger like me, but I guess you're getting it anyway."
2921,2020-06-24 22:59:37,hf11t5,"OP, get tested for low bp and do a turn table test (memory serves that's what it's called). You may have POTS syndrome."
2922,2020-06-24 23:29:36,hf11t5,"> So you can imagine my intense, ass-chapping, seething-just-beneath-the-surface, Tony-Stark-after-Steve-chose-Bucky frustration when I would leave her detailed instructions for tasks *she offered* to complete while I went to an appointment, and then return to everything but what I asked for. If I asked why she did something a certain way, she would say I didn’t specify how I wanted it done. *While holding written proof that I had specified.* I’m not certain she did it to fuck with me, but at the very least she just didn’t seem to care. Specialty foods I had to eat because of new restrictions? Thrown out to make room for her stuff. Medication that needed to be refrigerated? Left out on the counter for hours. Sentimental gifts? Broken or damaged. After years of her screaming at me if I touched anything in her hoard, she had no respect for my belongings. If I asked her to be careful or not to throw things away without checking with me first, she said I was ungrateful and that I should be thankful she wasn’t billing me for her time. 

OH. MY. GOD. My ex used to be like this, and it would drive me batshit crazy. 

I'd tell him to do something like sweep up the crap he knocked on the floor in the kitchen, and he'd proceed to clean everything BUT that. We could never clean the house together because he insisted on starting on whatever he cleaned the day before to re-clean it. He had no concept of food safety (mold could be growing on something and having an intelligent conversation with me, and he'd tell me that moldy item was still good), and I couldn't have him medicate my kid because he was the dumbass who would forget to take the previous day's doses of his own medications... and take two days worth. He broke sentimental things of mine that were packed up, but he would get angry if I threw out a small promotional item of his that was easily replaceable and had been on the floor on his side of the bed for three days.

By the time I took my DS and left the marriage, it was like I was having to parent him plus my kid. It was easier to be a single parent with an autoimmune disease living with my parents than it was to be married to him. (I do 99% of the child care--my mom subs in if I need a shower, have an appointment, or if I'm working and can't have my DS with me.)

And yes, I was an ungrateful bitch for asking him to do something while he was out because he worked full-time. (He would threaten to stay out later because I clearly didn't respect his job.)

I have to deal with my former father-in-law tomorrow (long story, don't ask), and he's not going to like my answer if he asks me to tell him again why I divorced his son."
2923,2020-06-25 05:44:20,hf11t5,"I really loved your academic AAVE stylings. Sorry JNMOM is hot garbage. I've got a 0.1/100,000 autoimmune disease and I'm lucky I'm still alive. Hang tough! Hope you've got a working treatment plan."
2924,2020-06-25 04:35:11,hf11t5,"I cannot wait for the next installment. You are a fantastic writer, there are definite moments where i full on belly laughed because I could picture the expression or the way it was said just by the description.

PS - sorry for the medical system not figuring out you disease immediately, as a healthcare professional that is the most frustrating thing when you can't be Dr House and solve the medical mystery."
2925,2020-06-25 10:50:07,hf11t5,Your experiences sound like the way I was raised exactly the same exactly the same type of mentality in regards to people life I'm just anything also I'm from the island's TnT So I truly understand what the elders as we would refer to them are like.
2926,2020-06-25 02:20:44,hf11t5,"Have you considered chronic fatigue syndrome? Both my kids have suffered from it, and thankfully cured because there is a treatment it’s just not widely known about. One of the side effects they both suffered with were undiagnosable gastric issues. Both became lactose intolerant and one now eats only plant based because it works better for her.
Either way good luck I hope your health returns."

I used to think it was just a Caribbean people thing or a capitalism thing, but there's this pervasive and really harmful notion that productivity dictates worth. Like the way everybody has to turn their hobbies into moneymaking ventures and something has to be happening every second of the day. It's unacceptable to just *be*, and I'm not sure why that is. I think COVID (particularly the ""I need a haircut"" protests) has shown us that people don't deal well with unoccupied time, and it's kinda scary."

""Just being"" is being productive! The human mind is not meant to be a factory machine 24/7! You need to rest, to recharge, to be happy! And instead of doing that, we push and push and push until people burn out and then silently pity-shame them. It's disgusting."

2940,2020-06-23 20:50:15,hemf5f,YTA for making me read that clusterfuck of a post.
2941,2020-06-23 20:39:40,hemf5f,"YTA because he was right, you didn't stop. You kept hounding him to the point where you were pretending to be your sister. That's not okay. I don't know if he was right to block you, but I don't think it was without reason."

But you hounded him over multiple platforms to give you an explanation after it was clear he didn’t want to, dragged other people into your argument because you decided you were owed a justification, and pretended to be your sister to talk to him because you couldn’t leave well enough alone. And on top of all that, you made up something about him wanting a mutual friend to die to goad him into giving you a response. This honestly makes me wonder if the pictures incident was simply the final straw for him, and not an isolated incident. Either way, it seems he made the right call and got rid of a REALLY toxic person in the process.

AITA for wanting an explanation why my friend hates me?

My “friend” that I’ve know science 5th, (we’re freshmen after summer) grade blocked me a few weeks ago for sending him three pictures, 

I was on FaceTime with another one of my friends (E) and she was sending my “friend”, who I’m gonna call C for the sake of this story, so E was sending C pictures of Lizzo and he likes E so he didn’t do anything about it, and then E tells me to send him a few pics and I do, it was latterly 3 photos, and after the first one C tells me to stop, but it was too late I had already sent the other two but they didn’t come through and he goes, “ok, I’m blocking you now” and I thought “eh whatever he’ll unblock me later”  he doesn’t.  And I go to Xbox and message him a joke about him that basically boils down to “ hehe you like to eat chicken nuggets hehe” and he goes I’m blocking you here now too.  I’m confused so I message him on discord and ask him why he’s blocking me and he blocks me on discord too.

So at this point I give up.  Flash forward to yesterday, and me and E were talking and the topic of C came up, and I said “add him I need an explanation” and E says ok. She adds C and he says to her over text, I’m not answering that because OP is in it, and I go ok I need to get to the bottom of this, so I ask my sister if I can use her phone and she says yes, and I text C, “hey, why do you hate me and want E to die” (he didn’t it was just a thing where she was scared and C wouldn’t join and she wanted people to talk to)  and C says “you don’t know how to stop and I don’t want emily to die I just don’t like you” 

(I’ll use this format because it’s easier)
Me:why don’t you like me, you blocked me over three pictures
C: because you don’t know how to stop, you’re being a real dick rn
Me: ok what ever (after this I end up acting like my sister just to see what he would do)
Me: what did my brother do wrong
C: you brother is being a big dick and won’t leave me alone
Me: you do know I’m like 9 right (I’m not, neither is my sister)
C:I don’t fucking care 
Me: my brother’s not a bad person
Me (coming back as me): wow dude, swearing at an 11 year old, and I’m the dick (this kid is like 15)
C: well you’re being a dick, I didn’t do anything wrong
Me: whatever you piece of garbage
C: never contact me again

And then I blocked him on my sisters phone and deleted the conversation, I’m still confused why he hates me, but whatever I’ll never see this price of shit ever again because I’m moving to a different country.  

If he reads this, which he probably won’t, you’re a piece of shit, fuck you.

2946,2020-06-23 20:57:08,hemf5f,"YTA This would be ESH, but you kept going and didn’t stop, making this kid not like you anymore and block you."
2947,2020-06-23 21:14:14,hemf5f,"You’re being weird first off with that texting him off your sisters phone and imitating your younger sister post C refusing to speak to you. And ESH. You should’ve had E explain what happened (since redditors can’t read, the photos were already sending after C asked OP to stop). 

If that didn’t fix it, stop there. Look, you’re young and you probably don’t know this but sometimes people overreact and have issues admitting that or they just need a reason not to like you because of things they won’t tell you. 

I think you should’ve let C cool down anyways. Pics of Lizzo obviously piss him off (no offense C sounds like he’s being a pussy over petty ish), and if he was that annoyed that he blocked you, I would’ve just let it go for the day and let the unblocking happen on its own. 

Idk man, humans are weird. But you’re all being weird assholes together."

2977,2020-06-21 01:54:37,hcygkc,I think if you searched traditional pop it might work.
2978,2020-06-21 03:44:48,hcygkc,"You're talking about ""big band"" era music. Variously called ""jazz vocals"", ""pop vocals"", ""swing jazz"" and ""swing"" as well.

Check out Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holliday, the Andrews Sisters and you'll probably especially like Marlene Dietrich. Bing Crosby, Tony Bennett, Nat ""King"" Cole and a young Frank Sinatra were the male ""crooners"". Louis Armstrong, Louis Jordan, Benny Goodman, Duke Ellington and Count Basie were the band leaders.

I've got plenty more if you're interested."
2979,2020-06-21 05:39:07,hcygkc,You’re a savior. Thank you.
2980,2020-07-10 18:57:55,hcygkc,"Just checked out Marlene. She was the closest being someone I’d like but strangely I’m not a fan of her voice. 

I really want to find a album in this genre so I can add it to my vinyl collection. Also would be great to have a compilation vinyl of great songs like this."
2981,2020-07-11 09:02:43,hcygkc,"Ok, Marlene's not for everyone. I'm attaching a few more possibilities, singers that some websites put in the same category as Vera Lynn and that I am guessing might be more of what you're looking for. Finding a song that equals ""We'll Meet Again"" in style and in the mood it evokes just might not be possible, however. Many of the sources I used to research this list speak of how Dame Vera's rendition managed to capture a unique blend of nostalgia and hope that became the definition of the experience for many of parting with loved ones at the beginning of World War II. It defines the era like no other can.

Plus, I wanted to mention that although most people associate WW II with the 1940s, the song was actually written and first recorded at the end of the 1930s. What was considered to be popular music at the time began changing during the war. In fact, the BBC came to think of this song in particular as [""sloppy sentimental rubbish""](https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-53079190), and cancelled the show on which Lynn sang it every week. Obviously, that opinion was then reversed, but musical styles kept evolving. 

Therefore, recordings you may have listened to or may choose to in the future could be of a somewhat different era than the one that produced this masterpiece. Even individual singers made adjustments to their styles to fit the times. So if you continue to be frustrated in your search it might be worth your while to try some recordings made in the 1930s as opposed to the 1940s. In any case, it's often helpful when experiencing cultural arts from the past to be aware of the dates they were made.

Furthermore, it seems that in some cases, the singer wasn't considered to be as important as the big band leader. These days, solo artists get all the attention and their accompanists are merely ""back up"" players. Back then, it was band leaders that in many cases had the name recognition, while the musicians and singers were somewhat interchangeable. But then some groups did hire particular voices for long periods of time, so this isn't always how it was done. It's good to keep in mind though that singers may not have always had a choice as to how they were supposed to sing or what songs they got to lend their voices to.

Nevertheless, here are a few more gals considered to be Vera Lynn-ish. Hope you find some you like. 

Connee Boswell [""In the Middle of a Kiss""](https://rilds.com/song/2296844714-connie_boswell/-19615898430990312211-in_the_middle_of_a_kiss/).     

Dinah Shore [""Together""](https://rilds.com/song/2593236841-dinah_shore/-18264499210496571137-together/).     

Dorothy Carless [""That Lovely Weekend""](https://rilds.com/song/3633590902-dorothy_carless/-01842730371783869325-that_lovely_weekend/).     

Doris Day [""Again""](https://rilds.com/song/1681680206-doris_day/19218085501362588674-again/).     

Anne Sheridan [""The Last Time I Saw Paris""](https://rilds.com/song/899415899-anne_shelton/11917549170536482410-the_last_time_i_saw_paris/).     

Judy Garland [""Over The Rainbow""](https://rilds.com/song/1473415657-judy_garland_with_orchestra/-00604511070711126371-over_the_rainbow/).     

Édith Piaf [""La Vie en Rose""](https://rilds.com/song/698568546-%C3%A9dith_piaf/01754486931980564502-la_vie_en_rose/).     

Allmusic recommends this album, appropriately titled [We'll Meet Again](https://www.allmusic.com/album/well-meet-again-classic-wartime-songs-that-kept-us-smiling-through-mw0002136953) as a good compilation of that era. I don't think it's available in vinyl though. 

You may have to search through albums produced between roughly 1960 and 1985 or so for that kind of record. Vera Lynn's big hit was, like everything else at the time, recorded as a single in 78 rpm format. You won't find a lot of LPs from back in those days, especially at 33.3 rpm. Don't know if you even have the ability to play 78s."

2984,2020-06-20 12:36:58,hcl299,Opinion: monet’s lipsync to good as hell in season 10 was also really good and fun to watch. She’s very entertaining while performing.
2985,2020-06-20 12:06:04,hcl299,"Well Monet went home on a Lizzo song so I wouldn’t be so sure, that said Monet did great"
2986,2020-06-20 12:23:47,hcl299,Monet getting her Lizzo rudemption was sweet (she wasn’t Valentina levels of bad on her Season ten lipsync but she still went home on it so like Valentina she’s lost and won a lipsync to the same artist’s song)

2988,2020-06-20 13:12:13,hcl299,Monet got her Lizzo redemption and I lived for every second of it. Juju served fun auntie that was just happy to be there to cheer on her niece.
2989,2020-06-20 15:05:28,hcl299,"Like with most lipsyncs in recent memory, the song choice is chosen specifically to cater to certain queens, thus allowing Ru to control the narrative while providing an illusion of choice."
2990,2020-06-20 16:06:09,hcl299,Monet ate!
2991,2020-06-20 15:31:29,hcl299,"I knew it as soon as the song started, Juice can only be embodied by a black woman-a! 💅"
2992,2020-06-20 18:21:14,hcl299,"Monet was just fantastic. She looked so beautiful and was so entertaining. The spotlight seemed to make her radiate even more. I could barely keep my eyes off of her!

That being said I’m still mad at jujubee for not knowing the words. I wanted her to get far in the competition until this exact moment. Maybe she can redeem herself but I am pretty disappointed."
2993,2020-06-20 19:18:21,hcl299,Monet can slay most songs to be fair
2994,2020-06-20 17:46:48,hcl299,I think it's a real pity that they had done a double shantay the week before because I felt like that one really deserved it.
2995,2020-06-20 13:08:47,hcl299,I always forget she didn’t win that lipsync. Kameron definitely won it but Monet was more memorable for sure
2996,2020-06-20 17:51:44,hcl299,"She's such a natural! Just effortlessly fun to watch, perfect comedic timing, and she really embodies the lyrics. Truly lip-living."
2997,2020-06-20 14:07:08,hcl299,"I think she only went home because it was her third time, she wore a terrible dance outfit, she broke a light, and she momentarily left the stage."
2998,2020-06-20 17:51:01,hcl299,MONET NOT GOOD AT LIPSYNCING because fucking why?! These fucking kids...
2999,2020-06-20 19:59:30,hcl299,Delusion....
3000,2020-06-20 16:43:19,hcl299,"To be fair, with the new twist I think the scales are supposed to be tipped in favor of the assassin."
3001,2020-06-20 13:18:18,hcl299,I agree! To me she had more charisma in that performance.
3002,2020-06-20 14:15:30,hcl299,"Kameron killed that lip sync, Monet just shouldn’t have been in the bottom compared to Aquaria (who was in line to win already at that point)"
3003,2020-06-21 17:45:12,hcl299,"I read here somewhere that the Lipsync Assassins were given a list of songs, like a regular season, and made to rank them from wouldn't enjoy performing it to would love performing it. Apparently Yvie was the only one that put Livin La Vida Loca as her number one choice and it was the  absolutely best outcome possible."
3004,2020-06-20 13:38:23,hcl299,Also her walking right out that door was so funny. It's not often anymore we see something in a lipsync that's never been done before.
3005,2020-06-20 14:16:24,hcl299,She still would've won with one bottom placement tbh and she would've taken out Kameron.
3006,2020-06-20 15:07:33,hcl299,"Really?

I’m always quite confused by people saying Aquaria should’ve been in the bottom because Capricia Corn’s makeup was probably the best in the Ep (just not as transformative as Miz Cookie bc Kingsley already has a round feminine face with nice features). 

Sure her outfits weren’t great but they were definitely less pedestrian than Monét and Kameron’s."
3007,2020-06-20 16:59:04,hcl299,"And Monet has done that pretty much every time. She is a true lipsync assassin, even if some were overshadowed in AS4."
3008,2020-06-20 19:29:18,hcl299,"I like what she was going for but there was something about the timing (maybe it took too long for her to get back there & come back out?) or something that kinda ruined the moment for me. Which is a shame, she’s an incredibly charismatic performer."
3009,2020-06-20 14:19:05,hcl299,"Yes, agreed. I hate when queens who are on track to win aren’t put into the bottom or held to the level of critique they should be based on their performance thus far.

They held Ben at a high standard on her original season and even said so during AS3 that 100% isn’t enough when she goes 150% all other times.

Aquaria should have been in the bottom just like (I know she didn’t win but it looked like she would most of the season) Gigi should have been in the bottom for the political challenge (or makeover since her outfit was lamer than Manila’s makeover that she made in the workroom for AS4 and was eliminated on)"
3010,2020-06-20 19:27:34,hcl299,I think she created two great looks but they felt completely disjointed. I didn’t get familial vibe from them at all (and some of that may have Kingsley bringing us no energy).
3011,2020-06-21 02:28:23,hcl299,"Monet made the whitest Youtuber actually look somewhat like her imo and served similar looks at least, Aquaria’s felt disjointed. Again, I thought Aquaria was going to win at that point so seeing a killer lip sync especially against kameron would have been amazing...like jinx and detox"
3012,2020-06-21 08:24:45,hcl299,Oh my word I just got flashbacks to Jump to It with Manila.
3013,2020-06-20 22:44:54,hcl299,I think had their runway presentation been more theatrical then the concept definitely would’ve come across better - you’re right about Kingsley; he seemed really over it throughout which is shocking to me.

3034,2020-06-20 08:38:26,hciiwp,I just think there have been so many lipsyncs of monets that are so much fucking better tho (personal opinion)

I dont know how old you are, but take a look further back, like 70s, GF :) Tons of great stuff there. Also early 80s(early MTV days) were GREAT too. check out artists like, Barry Manilow, Carpenters, BeeGees, Juice Newton, Dusty Springfield, and Reba McIntyre were great and have always spoken to my inner woman, long before my egg cracked. Music had always been a way for me to escape dysphoria."

3047,2020-06-30 02:53:05,hi7c53,"Wow hard relate to this post! This was a big part of me figuring out my gender identity. I've always loved pop music from all decades and had to repress a lot of that love to try to fit in as a man. I've been listening to so much femme pop lately and it makes me feel so liberated and myself. I still like some more masculine music but on the whole I think my music taste is more ""feminine"" (whatever that means) and it feels good to admit that.  My music taste is a lot more diverse now. Kim Petras Malibu video was what made me finally admit to myself that I'm trans and that's song of the year for sure!"
3048,2020-06-30 08:11:17,hi7c53,"Yeah, this was totally my experience. I always loved pop songs by women but to a pretty big extent was ''ashamed'' of admitting it to the wider world. The degree to which depended on the song.  Embracing that love has been great."
3049,2020-06-29 19:58:18,hi7c53,"It also should be noted that it is a point of internalized racism to avoid pop music as a whole, not just internalized “femmephobia” or whatever that means lol"

3051,2020-06-29 20:39:50,hi7c53,"How so?  🤷 I don't like pop music.  I like aggressive stuff, including gangsta rap."
3052,2020-07-01 04:55:59,hi7c53,"This list is all over the place stylistically and thematically, but every song is very much femme

3053,2020-06-29 20:41:12,hi7c53,"That statement itself is even more.. tone deaf and frankly far more insidiously racist than just not liking pop music but that’s an entirely different conversation from the one we’re having.

Black people being a foundation of most, if not all, music genres, pop music is purely based on what is attractive; The aesthetics. Black ideals are attractive but not black skin.

What you’ve said is “I like gangsta rap” as a contrast to pop music, othering black people before any context is given is at the very least is.. really fuckin strange and at worst, sparks red flags that as black person I would avoid talking to you just based on that."
3054,2020-06-30 04:42:13,hi7c53,"despite your explanation here, I’m still having trouble understanding how avoiding pop music is racist. there are many people who don’t like pop music for different reasons. could you please provide a concrete example as to how disliking pop is racist?"
3055,2020-06-29 20:46:25,hi7c53,"Okay, outside of rap, I also like Nat King Cole, Chuck Berry, Jimi Hendrix, Fishbone, Sevendust, Bad Brains, and Body Count.

If you want to insinuate I'm racist, then you don't know what the word means. 🙄🤷"
3056,2020-06-29 20:47:42,hi7c53,"Oh yes, please white girl with blonde hair and blue eyes, tell me what racism is because apparently my black ass just doesn’t know when I’m being micro-aggressed by overly defensive whites over the internet. Please. Give your thoughts on what makes up racism. I’m sure it’s very compelling. 

News flash: all white people, whether they’re actively trying to or not, contribute to racism. Someone saying you’re racist is at the least an objective observation and at the worst someone telling you to shut the fuck up when you’re speaking on stuff you don’t understand, have the resources to study, but just choose not to."

3080,2020-06-29 13:55:51,hhtn3t,"I've answered this question b4, Chirs Brown whether you like it or not is still profitable. He brings the label loads of money. A label is not gonna let go of a profitable client just because it's moral thing to do."
3081,2020-06-29 23:23:51,hhtn3t,He has a fanbase that buys his music. It's really that simple.
3082,2020-06-29 09:36:51,hhtn3t,"I mean, it's based on artistry, not their personal lives, so I can understand from that perspective. 

But he's dropped shite records every year since 2011, so I have no idea how he keeps getting nominated for awards these days."

The award is clearly based on his merits as an artist and the musical output he has (though, quite how he's being nominated for either of those is baffling as well), because if the BET Awards really wanted to become ""synonymous with powerful artistry and social commentary"", they wouldn't nominate a serial abuser. 

So clearly it ain't got anything to do with anything other than the art, bro."
3088,2020-06-29 10:20:47,hhtn3t,"Rihanna, apparently. 

Also, he isn't winning a Humanitarian Award, he's been nominated for his music, I just question while he still keeps getting nominated for that, considering its all been shit since *F.A.M.E.*.

He doesn't need to win anyone over in terms of his personality since that isn't what he's being judged on, though if he was, he clearly wouldn't win that one either."

3138,2020-08-20 12:50:43,id8ve7,I watched Joey Contino's Masked Singer US vs UK video and he's incredibly close-minded towards the UK version. He didn't say one good thing about it.
3139,2020-08-20 12:26:13,id8ve7,"One is about to have it's 4th season, the other is about to have it's 2nd. Not the fairest of comparisons"
3140,2020-08-20 12:52:01,id8ve7,"COMPARABLE COSTUMES-

🦊- UK by a hair, even though the ""mirror as outfit"" thing has become a trope for the franchise, especially for more low-effort outfits (like guest outfits, or outfits where the show is low budget by comparison)

👾- US, but the French knockoff tbh. Australia's is good too.

🌼- UK's. Both of them. 

🌲- US', but mostly because it looks a bit smug.

🦄- If I had to pick between the two, the UK's. He's cute. But tbh Australia beats them both. 

🦋- US obvs. If I was Tim Simpson I'd be a bit more factually correct with trying to make a butterfly costume, with a bit more focus on the back wings, but maybe it's because I thought we'd wait until S2 to have a butterfly costume and I ended up looking at a ton of British butterfly breeds to visualise...

🐝- UK's. French one is good too. 

PANEL-

**Ken Jeong (US)** V Ken Jeong (U.K.) - Ken and his schtick flow better on the US version, for me. When/if he comes back for S3, he needs to be a bit less one-note. 

**Robin Thicke** v Jonathan Ross - Jonathan's guesses are more like Jenny's guesses. Aside from the obvious (guessing Daisy was the pushing-daisies Natalie Cole), we also had Fox as Sam Fox. And I bet one Jane Austen that he'll think a Lion is Leona Lewis (if the lion is a girl). As for past problematic behaviour, at least Wossy is trying to learn from his recent transphobic mistakes...

Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg v **Davina McCall** - DUH

Nicole Scherzinger v **Rita Ora** - I mean, Scherzy was good on The X Factor and great on the Sing-Off (even though she began all of her sentences with ""Um, girls..."" or ""Um, boys...""). But Rita's ""AWH DAHHHK"" schtick is really cute, and she's my favourite of the panellists (ok, Mo might give her a run for her money...)

Ken Jeong (US) v **Mo Gilligan** (new replacement for U.K. season 2) - Already fuming that Mo's only going to be in one series (that, or S3 will be filming earlier in September)

HOST-

Nick Cannon v **Joel Dommett** - Both are really good, but Nick's a hotep. 

COMPARABLE PERFORMANCES-

“Someone You Loved”- (Lewis Capaldi) Rottweiler v **Queen Bee** - same with Alive.

“Happy”- (Pharrell Williams) Alien v **Monster** - Feel it Still (Alien vs Chameleon) is a tie though. 

“Can’t Feel My Face”- (The Weeknd) Peacock v **Daisy** - by a hair. I'm surprised that >!Kelis!< could sound like that, but maybe I'm only really used to her singing quite softly. But also CFMF was Peacock's best performance, where we got to see a clean cut Mormon pull off singing about his love for cocaine. 

“Juice”- (Lizzo) **Ladybug** v Unicorn - truly, the worst of Unicorn's performances

“Livin’ On a Prayer”- (Bon Jovi) Butterfly v **Duck** - again, by a hair. Both of them were quite boring tbh, but we got the electrocution moment from Butterfly, and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzJiNFCEtwY) from Duck.

“Don’t Cha”- Pussycat Dolls **Leopard** v Monster - Yeah, I know, Don't Cha is Monster's song and was the first time seven-year-old me had heard of him, but Leopard beat him at his own game. 

Also, if you want to block out spoilers, use this:

    >!Place spoiler text here!<"
3141,2020-08-20 16:52:11,id8ve7,"Ok my costume opinion:

Monster: US had a better one

Tree: istg the UK one is so ugly

Flower: i honestly liked both equally since Daisy‘s suite rocks

Unicorn: UK had some colours and a more unique design

Bee: It’s an unpopular opinion but i was in love with the costume and the face

Fox: Again i liked both but UK had a really fun costume with the mirrors

Butterfly: The UK butterfly had really bad looking wings but US had a marvelous concept and end effect"
3142,2020-08-21 01:19:12,id8ve7,"COMPARABLE COSTUMES-

🦊- Wayne Brady’s costume: probably one of my favorite masked singer costumes ever, I thought a steam punk fox was so cool

👾- CeeLo Green’s costume: I just liked how huge it was, he had so much room in there 

🌼-  both were so gorgeous, I can’t choose between them

🌲- Teddy Sherringham’s costume: I thought the detail on it was amazing

🦄-  Jake Sheers’ costume: honestly I preferred Australia’s version but Tori Spelling has one of the worst costumes because it was so boring

🦋- Michelle Williams’ costume: that costume was made for her body shape

🐝- Gladys Knight’s costume: I liked Nicola’s but the face scared me lol

PANEL- 

Ken Jeong (U.K.): he was slightly less annoying on the UK version

Jonathan Ross: he was hilarious and he actually had decent guesses when he wasn’t joking around

Davina McCall: I didn’t like either of them but Jenny is more annoying

Nicole Scherzinger: she makes me laugh despite all of her crying and Rita was so annoying every time she guessed correctly


COMPARABLE PERFORMANCES-

“Someone You Loved”- (Lewis Capaldi)
Rottweiler: Rottweiler is my favorite masked singer of all time

“Happy”- (Pharrell Williams)
Monster: alien was not a good singer (sorry but it’s true)

“Can’t Feel My Face”- (The Weeknd)
Daisy: unpopular opinion but I thought peacock was so annoying and too cocky for his own good

“Juice”- (Lizzo)
Ladybug: her dancing just made me happy idk

“Livin’ On a Prayer”- (Bon Jovi)
Butterfly: I still watch her performance on YouTube, she was amazing 

“Don’t Cha”- Pussycat Dolls
Leopard: he was so theatrical and played a great character, plus he sang it directly to Nicole which was fun

Overall: I liked the costumes from both versions all the same, both shows had pretty awesome costumes. The UK panel had better chemistry and was funnier. The US had better singers and performers overall."
3143,2020-08-20 12:52:39,id8ve7,I think Masked Singer fans are very patriotic towards their home series. The British fans might think Nick is ottp whereas American fans might think Joel’s hosting has a lot to be desired.
3144,2020-08-20 12:29:50,id8ve7,"Yeah I understand, I thought it would be fun to see which aspects of the show we all preferred. Do we think the costumes (that can be compared because it’s not fair to compare pharaoh to frog for example) are better from the US or the U.K.? Are some of the performances of the same songs better from either version."

3211,2020-08-15 18:06:43,iaaaz4,"Yeah, internalized fatphobia. It’s something everyone has, even fat people. It’s a result of the society and media we experience. 

Being fat is not inherently negative. Being fat does not mean that you’re a “pig”. Being skinny does not mean you are healthy. Being fat doesn’t mean you are less than anyone else. Taking care of your health is important, yes. Being fat does not equal unhealthy."

3220,2020-08-15 14:15:51,ia1gfe,"I see it a lot less as her ""bringing it back"" as an individual, and much more of her being part of a wave of artists who are heavily influenced by Prince. I don't know if it would be fair to call it a ""Minnesota Sound (TM)"", but she, Janelle Monae, and several others in the past few years (especially since Prince's passing) have been really pulling on his style in particular.

I dig the hell out of it, whatever it is."

Sad to say, I think it's because she's a bold Black woman that rightly makes a lot of folks uncomfortable (in the best way). I feel like the industry went ""oh look! It's upbeat and we get progressive ""wokeness"" points"" and then moved on. I hope I'm wrong, but that's what it felt like to me."

You got Mark Ronson of course, and you can also go back to the 90s and look at Jamiriquai but he wasn’t really a huge act outside of a big single."

>That is not the end of the dispute, however. According to the ruling, the three songwriters have indicated that they now intend to claim that “Truth Hurts” was the end result of a continuous creative process that began with “Healthy.”

>Gee allowed the songwriters to amend their lawsuit to pursue that theory.

It seems to be a technicality so far"
3258,2020-08-15 01:25:03,i9yjok,A win! and uhh musicologists are apparently a real thing

3260,2020-08-15 13:21:52,i9yjok,"Is this the case involving that real sketchy guy Jesse Saint John? I liked a couple of his songs, but he was accused of sexual assault and just never addressed it, which is super yucky. He also kept liking literal porn on Twitter which ended up on my feed so I had to unfollow him. 

It’s unfortunate Yves Rothman got tangled in this. I really like his work and I’d like to think that if he’s involved there should be a good reason. I think I need to hear the song “Healthy” to really make a decision.

I highly encourage y’all to listen to Premonitions by Miya Folick, which has Yves Rothman’s fantastic production all over it. Also the album “Look At Us Now Dad” Banoffee"

3267,2020-08-15 13:11:00,i9yjok,"yeah that really makes sense. derivative doesn't make 100% sense, but a continuous creative process makes me think they probably have the better case here moving forward. kinda stupid that it went to this lawsuit tho, it's quite clear once you play ""Healthy"" that it was at least an early demo version of ""Truth Hurts"" (like, melody is the same but an octave up, rhythm is the same, instrumental is the same concept, lyrics are spot on) so the fact that the label just didn't credit them way back in 2017 when this whole dispute started is just mind boggling

also the fact that it's continuing is good news for songwriters because this case definitely could have set a horrible precedent for them if they lost, straight up. would have seen labels get bold with a lot more songs with less songwriters credited"

3271,2020-08-15 02:47:32,i9yjok,"That case is especially ridiculous. Iirc she's trying to sue her over using ""ya ya ee"" because she claims she was the one who originated it."
3272,2020-08-15 16:20:45,i9yjok,"Oh god I had an ex who was obsessed with Jesse Saint John. When Brooke Candy started hitting the scene (I think Jesse helped write Das Me?? He was in the video at least) my ex’s claim to fame was how Jesse had liked a photo on his Tumblr once or something. It was not an impressive brag.

edit: clarification"
3273,2020-08-15 07:22:00,i9yjok,A lot of music lawsuits are so stupid... trials like these could set a dangerous precedent for future artists.

3279,2020-08-15 03:56:48,i9yjok,"while I think it's ridiculous too (and that a lot of these lawsuits are creatively stifling) is there a precedent for these?

Isn't one of the most sampled pieces of music Slick Rick's La di da di? Miley samples it in We Can't Stop and it gets credit even though it's different melodically, it the word/verbiage (for want of a better term - I know there's an actual term for this) that's being used.

Are you still looking and are you willing to relocate?"

3322,2020-10-25 19:24:22,io83ve,I appreciate that lovely quote and your question on relocation. At this time in my life I am not due to a passing in my family during this quarantine.
3323,2020-10-25 19:30:04,io83ve,Well to be fair it wouldn't be an immediate relocation if there was one. I would like to get to know someone before I got into a relationship with them. So if you would like to keep it friendly and online I'd love to see if we would be compatible and let the chips fall where they may.

3406,2020-09-02 00:03:49,ikfnvk,"I know that, but I actually like this generational grouping. Makes all generations 18-19 years is very balanced, compared to making it very short as 15-16 or less years or making it very long like 21-22+ years. It makes things easier for everyone else instead of all this confusion. But at the same time, this is all arbitrary. I know that we are not really millennials at the end of the day, especially based on how society views millennials and such, but maybe being a millennial is different to another person. Just my two cents."

3409,2020-09-01 07:43:39,ikfnvk,"I dont think ""first who cant possibly remember"" or ""last who can possibly remember"" something are good markers to mark a generation. I mean it is very likely a three or four year old would not remember the political importance of these events. They may not even know who this Kennedy is until like years after he died. 1961 might have memories prior to Kennedy's death.  I am sure many 1959 and 1960 borns would not remember Kennedy's death. Many 1995-1998 dont even remember 9/11. 2015-2017 though can end up remembering a world before coronavirus 15 years from now, even though they may not know what coronavirus is.

Many people want to begin gen y at 1980 since it's the first 80s year, so whenever they also apply the 18 year span, it ends up being 1980-1998. You barely ever see 1942-1960 and 1999-2017 though."
3412,2020-09-01 08:09:10,ikfnvk,"I prefer the ranges next to: instead of this rather than its this. Makes no sense for 1960 to be gatekept from the other two early 60s years. You even said 1980 should be start of millennials since it is the first 80s year. First half of the 60s is gen jones anyways. 

I have seen 1945-1959 as a baby boomer definition. 

Then 1960-1979. 

1980-1999 is one of the most agreeable millennial definitions I have come across. It is my favorite actually.

I have seen 1998-2016. Never 1999-2017 though. People would prefer stating X in 1960 if 1964 or 1965 is too late, since the first three years of the 60s are the full early 60s years, just like how you said 1980 should be y as it is the first 80s year. People prefer 1982 over 1980 as the millennial start date though."

I have seen 1980-1998 (though I feel that most start Y in 1980 cause it is the first 80s year like ending it in 1994 or 1999 for the same numerical reason.

3420,2020-10-09 15:56:24,j812gx,Completely agree with top 2. I feel like the Mulaney episodes are always so damn good. His 3rd one not as much as his first two. I’m biased because I love John but I’d put one of his first two hosting gigs as my 3rd.
3421,2020-10-09 19:41:31,j812gx,"Top 3:

Larry David(Season 41)

&#x200B;

Jimmy Fallon/Harry Styles

&#x200B;

Bill Hader/Hozier"
3422,2020-10-09 20:43:34,j812gx,"1. Jimmy Fallon/Justin Timberlake
2. John Mulaney/Jack White
3. Dave Chapelle/A Tribe Called Quest

And maybe that is controversial but I feel like Adam Sandler/Shawn Mendes episode was stronger than Eddie Murphy/Lizzo. Cast had more opportunity to shine"
3423,2020-10-09 19:06:34,j812gx,"I actually did not care for the Chappelle episode at all.  

Eddie Murphy blew me away though with his energy, very unexpected considering how he appeared at the 40th Anniversary.

My favorite episode of the decade without thinking too much about it was Josh Hutcherson/HAIM"
3424,2020-10-10 00:28:01,j812gx,"1. John Mulaney / David Byrne
2. Adam Sandler / Shawn Mendes
3. Betty White / Jay Z"
3425,2020-10-09 21:47:08,j812gx,I'm not sure about other two but the Christmas episode in 2012 right after the Sandy Hook shootings hosted by Martin Short was fucking amazing. Easily one of the best Christmas episodes of the decade for me.
3426,2020-10-11 04:53:17,j812gx,I don’t know if I have a top 3 but one of my favorites was definitely Zach Galifinakis/Of Monsters and Men from 2013
3427,2020-10-09 17:39:57,j812gx,very underrated and i was glad when he got to host more
3428,2020-10-09 17:55:34,j812gx,"I think what made Mulaney’s first episode so good was the fact that expectations were not super high, but then he hit it out of the park."
3429,2020-10-10 00:26:06,j812gx,"I prefer the third mulroney episode, just for David Byrne"
3430,2020-10-10 03:42:13,j812gx,that WAS a hilarious episode 😂
3431,2020-10-09 18:18:18,j812gx,"Completely agreed, he was incredible"
3432,2020-10-10 03:41:46,j812gx,love David’s performance

3438,2020-10-08 17:09:40,j7ezj0,Agree!
3439,2020-10-09 00:12:29,j7ezj0,"Couldn’t agree more! There are even hateful reviews of her albums on iTunes, claiming bullshit like she can’t sing (I mean come on) IMO it’s pathetic to be obsessed with another person’s weight that much, like get a life 🙄

Plus Lizzo is stunning and haters are ugly at any size ❤️"
3440,2020-10-10 01:42:32,j7ezj0,Lots of men love her body type. She seems fit in body and mind to me.
3441,2020-10-09 14:19:55,j7ezj0,"She literally posts near nudes though, which besides being inappropriate when other stars/people do it, is begging for this type of call out.

Would you want your daughter to dress like that? I don’t care that’s she’s, honestly, morbidly obese. I care that she celebrates it as being an accomplishment."
3442,2020-10-27 22:01:20,j7ezj0,"The only way Lizzzo is healthy is if she accepts that she is the hippo she is. Even then, most hippos are not that heavy. Seriously, she should not be commended for saying being morbidly obese and a wobbling pile of brown jell-O is good, and wobble it everywhere while making her ego larger then she even is, which is a near impossible feat."
3443,2020-10-30 01:53:19,j7ezj0,lizzo looks like big chungus
3444,2021-03-30 20:58:26,j7ezj0,who the fuck are these people? is it me or is the music industry just getting the most degenerates they could find to screw up the youth? seriously cardi b is a stripper talking about wet ass pussy at some who gives a fuck award show but dr suess is offensive? Why even try to promote talented artists anymore? Let's just pick some random crack addled porn star and make her lip sync about sucking big dicks. what a society we live in.
3445,2020-10-10 04:40:45,j7ezj0,fr💕
3446,2020-10-28 01:43:31,j7ezj0,Ur prob fat as well.
3447,2020-10-09 14:59:23,j7ezj0,"she’s a fucking adult. not a child. second, ik what she posts but y’all wouldn’t have an issue with seeing another woman’s ass or boobs if they were skinny."
3448,2021-04-03 07:38:19,j7ezj0,Being comfortable isn’t the same as promoting 😐
3449,2020-10-27 22:03:26,j7ezj0,"I’m pretty sure she knows her weight and is already exercising and eating healthy. and like I said, body weight changes doesn’t happen over night. it will take time."
3450,2020-10-31 06:28:15,j7ezj0,I love how when talking about a public figure online people think they can just say whatever same goes for ppl who insult others online.Like do you realise how terrible you would look saying “You’re fat” to another person in real life...well you look just as bad saying it online....
3451,2020-10-09 15:03:17,j7ezj0,"Well, sorry for your anger.  But I do have problems with the rest of hoes doing it as well

Edit:  I stated as much in my post above"
3452,2020-10-31 06:30:52,j7ezj0,"imagine a grown ass adult calling a lady a hippo..really makes you think what went wrong in their life,doesn’t it...?"
3453,2020-10-09 15:06:57,j7ezj0,"she dances in a bikini. a bikini. and her new post is her in a bikini that matches her. also, a girl in a bikini posting herself isn’t her being a hoe. that’s someone who sleeps with people all the time."
3454,2020-10-09 15:36:59,j7ezj0,"I’m not going to argue you against bikini vs what else is out there from her. You have google and it’s really up to you to maintain your own integrity.

Hoe doesn’t equal sex and since they now have definitions for these words I believe you mistook me for calling her a slut.

And I never called her a hoe, I referred to the others they post their naked selves online (for whatever reason...)"
3455,2020-10-09 15:49:21,j7ezj0,"still doesn’t make them a hoe. that’s someone who sleeps around. not someone who posts their naked bodies. and ik but even if she’s wearing a dress, they still body shame her."
3456,2020-10-09 16:13:47,j7ezj0,"To me: a hoe is someone who uses their body and/or sexuality for gains.

Slut uses sex. By that’s just semantics at this point and only my opinion.

I’ve seen her bare ass online and her body in sheer clothing. I cringe at it just like I do Kim K and who ever else."
3457,2020-10-08 14:23:22,j7bubr,"The idea of the glee club doing a song from Mulan and giving it to Rachel instead of Tina, leaving her no option but to imagine herself singing it, is *so* terrible but exactly on brand for Glee."
3458,2020-10-08 14:32:11,j7bubr,"THEY HAD AN EPISODE CALLED BAD REPUTATION AND DIDNT DO JOAN JETT?! 

Seriously tho, I always thought that was a huge missed opportunity. Literally Quinn could have done the song and it would have been perfect for her arch. It makes so mad. 

But instead they do “do you wanna touch me” where Paltrow sing it to high school students…"
3459,2020-10-08 13:17:09,j7bubr,WAP
3460,2020-10-08 13:24:29,j7bubr,"quinn would’ve eaten sofia by clairo, or anything by clairo tbh. 

WAP performed by santana, mercedes and brittany. 

911 by tina 👀"
3461,2020-10-08 14:38:57,j7bubr,I could see Rachel doing LWYMMD when she doesn't get every solo in a competition
3462,2020-10-08 14:20:01,j7bubr,"Santana and Mercedes would’ve killed Rain On Me.

Artie would rock Don’t Hurt Yourself by Beyoncé.

Santana and Brittany should do Slumber Party.

Don’t Start Now would’ve been a great group number.

Again, RIP Naya, my favourite actress from the show. I loved her character and her voice so much. May she rest in peace."
3463,2020-10-08 14:30:13,j7bubr,I swear Chord was supposed to sing I Knew You Were Trouble in the Guilty Pleasures episode. I have no clue why they cut it.
3464,2020-10-08 15:42:47,j7bubr,Squidward Nose
3465,2020-10-08 13:58:45,j7bubr,what if Mercedes does BGE? omg
3466,2020-10-08 13:38:44,j7bubr,"Long Live should've been their final song because the lyrics is just so apt. It perfectly describes their journey and even their wins at Nationals. But nooo, they did I Lived.

>The time we stood with our shaking hands  
The crowds in stands went wild  
We were the kings and the queens  
And they read off our names

Rachel could've covered Thank You For The Music if they had an ABBA week because the lyrics fit with her character:

>I'm nothing special, in fact I'm a bit of a bore  
If I tell a joke, you've probably heard it before  
But I have a talent, a wonderful thing  
'Cause everyone listens when I start to sing

Taylor Swift's Holy Ground would fit with Santana and Brittany's story when Santana moved to New York. 

>Tonight I’m gonna dance for all that we’ve been through.  
But I don’t wanna dance if I’m not dancing with you.

I would've been happy with Santana covering any and every song in the world. But maybe some Kacey Musgraves would be nice."
3467,2020-10-08 15:40:19,j7bubr,"Given that I can't hear the original version of Van Halen's Jump without expecting Rachel's belting note over the guitar solo, I'm not entirely sure I'd want them to do more, but here goes...  

Billie Eilish - Bad Guy. Sung by Alistair. Obviously.  

I think Jesse St James would be good for a song or two from Hamilton, can't think which ones though. Maybe My Shot? Or It's Quiet Uptown?  

I'd like to see punk/alternative Quinn brought back and explored further, maybe covering some Meg Myers or Poppy.  

Also a female empowerment episode: one of the guys makes a sexist comment. The Glee club is split into girls and boys for the week, with the guys having to do songs performed by female artist, whereas the girls have free reign. Everybody learns a lesson at the end and is happy. Songs:  
* Hailee Steinfeld - Love Myself. Sung by a shy character who breaks out of her shell for the episode before being reset for next week (Marley? Tina?). The whole thing is played completely straight despite the obvious fact that the song is actually about wanking.  
* Fifth Harmony - That's My Girl. Closing song, sung by the boys (and Will!) to an audience of all the women who have ever been in the show, logic/transport/continuity be damned.  
* Queen - Fat Bottomed Girls. Mercedes sings this because of some vague body positivity message.

I have a lot of thoughts about this show and the potential from the first season that was wasted, but I have a very good therapist who is helping me work through them."
3468,2020-10-08 18:31:19,j7bubr,Girlfriend by Avril Lavigne! I’m honestly surprised they didn’t do it as the song was massive back in its day and they did Keep Holding On. I can see this done by Quinn and Santana.
3469,2020-10-08 14:01:42,j7bubr,"TLC- Unpretty

Doja Cat- Streets

Janet Jackson- That’s the Way Love Goes

Beyoncé- XO"
3470,2020-10-08 19:48:12,j7bubr,i can see tina quitting glee club after being disrespected for the 100th time and singing look what you made me do
3471,2020-10-09 00:58:59,j7bubr,"Songs I think Quinn should've sung:

* I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman - in the first Britney tribute episode. Would've made sense story-wise as it would've been after she had given birth and her trying to make sense of her identity at that point.
* Material Girl - in the Season 2 prom episode. Would've been a fun number that suited Quinn's characterisation at that point.
* Lucky Star - Dianna could pull off a young Madonna look and had a quite a high voice early on, so this would've been a cool number for the Madonna episode.

Songs I think Tina should've sung:

* Reflection as mentioned above
* Never Let Me Go by Florence + the Machine - this would've been a really good competition number
* Also think she would've sounded great on a Kylie Minogue song like Come into My World

Also, Artie and Santana should've duetted on The Way You Make Me Feel by MJ back in Season 2 when Brittany was dating Artie and Santana was figuring out her sexuality."
3472,2020-10-08 15:49:06,j7bubr,I wish they could have sung Circus by Britney Spears as either a group or as a duet with Brittany and Santana
3473,2020-10-08 21:49:24,j7bubr,Into You by Mercedes would’ve been so well. I also see the Unholy Trinity doing God is a woman
3474,2020-10-08 13:55:12,j7bubr,Any Kylie Minogue song.
3475,2020-10-08 13:52:22,j7bubr,I’ve been rewatching it and there’s honestly so many songs that would have ATE. Although the storylines we would have gotten with the tik tok songs would have had me facepalming so hard. I don’t even want to know what they would have done with Say So
3476,2020-10-09 03:15:38,j7bubr,i totally agree with OP about them doing more Journey. sure there was the joke they did all their songs but there were so many great Journey songs they didn’t record.
3477,2020-10-08 14:11:46,j7bubr,"I want to see Kurt sing anything Troye Sivan

Either from Blue Neighborhood or Bloom"
3478,2020-10-08 14:55:11,j7bubr,Idk by the time the show was ending the covers were getting pretty bad so I’m actually thankful most of the time lol but the original Glee crew would’ve done well with Don’t Start Now
3479,2020-10-08 20:04:23,j7bubr,I've never seen this show but I know Jonathan Groff was in it and so of course his character would have to do You'll Be Back from Hamilton.
3480,2020-10-08 23:38:36,j7bubr,Hey Angel by One Direction
3481,2020-10-09 02:38:26,j7bubr,I just realized Quinn could have sung She Used to Be Mine!!!
3482,2020-10-08 15:08:38,j7bubr,Ultraviolence
3483,2020-10-08 14:18:04,j7bubr,"Don’t start now

(If it had been released back then)"
3484,2020-10-08 15:51:23,j7bubr,"I’m already seething just imagining it like those episodes where they pretended they weren’t treating Tina like shit and having her going into hallucinations to do some mental gymnastics of ‘Oh no, Rachel actually has it worse’"
3485,2020-10-09 00:51:01,j7bubr,"Jenna was the most underrated singer on the show and no one can change my mind on that (she does really good belts in the background on Hate on Me). The fact that her first solo was heavily autotuned (True Colours), and so many were cut short and not released was so unfair."
3486,2020-10-08 18:22:59,j7bubr,"Yeah, exactly why I saw it that way too 😞"
3487,2020-10-08 15:24:40,j7bubr,"> But instead they do “do you wanna touch me” where Paltrow sing it to high school students…

A song written by a convicted sex offender and actual paedophile, no less!"
3488,2020-10-08 17:32:23,j7bubr,"In fairness, the theme of that episode was songs that **have** a bad reputation, and I don’t know anyone who dislikes Joan Jett. 

Quinn **would’ve** killed that song though, but you just know they would’ve given it to Rachel."
3489,2020-10-08 13:54:54,j7bubr,but done by Schuester.
3490,2020-10-08 14:13:29,j7bubr,We joke but Santana and mercedes would've killed this
3491,2020-10-08 18:27:52,j7bubr,This could be a Santana-Kitty duet but idk how will that happen lol
3492,2020-10-09 00:36:29,j7bubr,the only way this would be acceptable would be if it were performed by Naya Rivera and Amber Riley but you know they would make Lea Michele do it and/or Jane Lynch and the shoe.
3493,2020-10-08 13:50:13,j7bubr,"Shit, 911 would fit Tina!! Her falsetto is one of my faves, and it would certainly fit her in the prechorus"
3494,2020-10-08 16:33:31,j7bubr,sofia would be perfect for her omg 😭 if only they had the guts to explore her sexuality.
3495,2020-10-08 18:21:58,j7bubr,Or Sunshine coming back and singing this to Rachel lol
3496,2020-10-08 18:32:02,j7bubr,They changed it to Copacabana lol.
3497,2020-10-08 14:21:00,j7bubr,Amber's (or RILEY's) EP is actually really good.
3498,2020-10-08 16:15:25,j7bubr,"Santana singing Rainbow by Kacey Musgraves to Brittany would have been amazing. 

Like if Brittany was having a rough time and really sad/down, then Santana comes in with Rainbow? 😭"
3499,2020-10-08 18:48:38,j7bubr,"Marley singing Dandelions by Kacey Musgraves at some point about Jake would have been really nice, but I guess it's a lesser known one so they wouldn't have gone for it anyways"
3500,2020-10-08 17:49:03,j7bubr,"Jonathan Groff, who plays Jesse St James, actually originated the part of King George in Hamilton so I think there’s your Hamilton song choices right there lol. 

Puck actually sang Fat Bottomed Girls in S2 to Lauren Zises"
3501,2020-10-08 18:34:28,j7bubr,Girlfriend would be a KILLER Cheerios number!
3502,2020-10-08 14:16:41,j7bubr,"They’ve done Unpretty, in a mashup with I Feel Pretty"
3503,2020-10-08 18:24:41,j7bubr,"XO would've been a great proposal song. I would imagine it as a Blainetana duet, or maybe a re-arranged version during the double wedding"
3504,2020-10-08 21:50:36,j7bubr,The way I know Santana would’ve done Streets so well
3505,2020-10-09 02:37:21,j7bubr,I like these choices!! IMO Quinn and Tina should also have one more duet. So Far Away was immaculate
3506,2020-10-09 02:35:44,j7bubr,Into You by Mercedes! Yes! Sounds like a good song after she gets married and finally has sex during the honeymoon.
3507,2020-10-08 18:25:37,j7bubr,"Marley, Brittany, Madison, or Kitty would kill it either as a solo or a group number"
3508,2020-10-08 18:26:48,j7bubr,"I could definitely imagine Say So as a Mercedes-Santana duet, but like ""Like a Virgin"", while they sing it separately to Sam and Brittany during a sexy scene"
3509,2020-10-08 20:40:39,j7bubr,Right?! It was so awkward especially when her character is portrayed as the hot sexy teacher.
3510,2020-10-09 03:16:44,j7bubr,i thought they were doing it as like a joke
3511,2020-10-08 20:41:27,j7bubr,I feel like it would have worked for Quinn because she trying to let go of her reputation. But definitely racheal would have sang it.

3513,2020-10-08 13:56:48,j7bubr,"Schuester and Sue would’ve done a duet unfortunately :/

3516,2020-10-08 18:29:35,j7bubr,I’m loving the Tina appreciation here. She’s definitely one of the strongest and most versatile singers on the show but was criminally underutilized and ignored throughout the show’s run. Fück Ryan Murphy lmao.
3517,2020-10-08 20:54:34,j7bubr,"sameee I’m still bitter about it 🥺 all those scenes with rachel screamed enemies to lovers. The producers kinda hinted that quinn was queer all along and then she went on to sleep with santana, but nothing else happened after that 😔"
3518,2020-10-08 21:50:04,j7bubr,WHAT ?????? WHY
3519,2020-10-08 15:34:31,j7bubr,her live performance is even better

Dammit! I thought he'd covered it but I've managed to erase it from my memory, and the Fat Bottomed Girls Wikipedia page didn't mention it so I figured it was a fever dream! Thank you for clarifying

> Jonathan Groff, who plays Jesse St James, actually originated the part of King George in Hamilton so I think there’s your Hamilton song choices right there lol.  

That was kinda my joke :P"

3524,2020-10-08 20:50:44,j7bubr,"Oh it would’ve 100% worked for Quinn. After season 1 her character really went to shit, but in season 3 she was literally dressing like a punk rocker and had her hair dyed pink and people were like “Quinn stop you’re gonna ruin your life” and she’s like “cool, don’t give a shit”. 

LITERALLY THE PERFECT SET UP but nope. Botched it.

Hell, her and Santana could’ve done a duet of it at literally any point in the show and it would’ve fit."

3533,2020-10-07 23:09:34,j70tef,"I can't say for sure what your experiences indicate.  However, I would dispute the idea that your trauma is too mild to potentially have led to a dissociative disorder.  In the end, it's about how heavily it affected you, not any ""objective"" standard of severity, and it's possible your memories have blocked emotional content to downplay how you were affected at the time.

I'm currently questioning and unless I have any suppressed memories, my own trauma, while constant through the critical years, was not what many people would consider severe.

Additionally, based on the staggeringly incorrect information your therapist said about the prevalence of DID, I'd recommend getting a new one if you're in a position to do so."
3534,2020-10-08 05:36:30,j70tef,"Your therapist is wrong. And as she said, she is not a specialist. Dissociative disorders are not 'rare'. And even if it were who's to say you aren't the second person with DID/OSDD in your state? Is there a state limit?

The same kinds of 'professionals' made outdated claims that 'only boys have autism' based on little real knowledge. Now we know that this just isn't true and it's common knowledge. The world will catch up eventually when it comes to dissociation too.

Don't expect to get good help from her if you suspect a dissociation disorder at this point. You may want to start looking for a therapist with dissociation knowledge or at least one who will not invalidate you."
3535,2020-10-08 06:19:29,j70tef,"1. Dissociative disorders are a spectrum and the conditions and the severity can very. Your therapist probably reads by the book of DSM that you have to have amnesia, fugue etc.

2. In fact your doubts in the condition is a sign to think about OSDD/DID seriously. People who dont doubt it are more likely not to have the condition. Thats like a proven statistical fact. 

3 Give her the ISSTD guidelines for treating the dissociative disorder. They are in the FAQ of either this or r/DID sub. Its all in there: how really not that rare the condition is, what tests to use, how to treat it etc. That is, if you want to continue to work with this therapist and you feel good rapport. Please keep in mind that the therapists with experience under 4-5 years tend to be not experienced enough to handle dissociative clients, sadly."

3585,2020-11-09 08:40:33,jqtaum,"I’m not American, (still a black woman though) but I like Lizzo. Her songs are catchy, upbeat and brimming with confidence and attitude. I’ve never had Lizzo played at me by someone who was berating me while doing it though. 

As for this: 

> What makes all of this worse is that the white women who claim to love Lizzo don’t actually support, uplift or center Black women in real life.

Well yeah, it’s pretty well-established that liking black music or black culture doesn’t necessarily translate to a respect for black *people*, but I don’t think that’s something that you can hold Lizzo responsible for. She’s an entertainer and how woke her fans are isn’t really something that’s within her control."
3586,2020-11-09 08:40:07,jqtaum,"She's super talented,  I actually really enjoy her music. I'm not going to be a contrarian just because someone is popular with wht people."
3587,2020-11-09 09:01:31,jqtaum,"So! I really should go to bed but I did want to draw a comparison here. Other people have asked the same question about Lizzo, and in one discussion, I saw a reply that talked about how the same questions/accusations in some cases were made towards Whitney Houston. I remember reading that and thinking wait, y'all accused Whitney Houston of pandering to white people? Are we watching the same movies and listening to the same songs?

The answer is that, of course, it's complicated. You very quickly run into issues of how blackness, and Black culture, is perceived by different groups at different times here in the US. That, in turn, has an effect on music, in terms of how genres intersect and influence one another, and the ways in which we racialize them. A lot of people, myself included, would argue that Lizzo makes pop music, or music that fits into pop as well other genres. Does that mean her music is more for white women than black women? I mean, Whitney made pop music. Pretty much all of the Jackson's did too, solo and group. Beyonce and Mariah Carey made pop music. Would we consider them to make music for white people vs black people?  And questions about how they market themselves really fall back to that same question of how blackness and Black culture was and is perceived.

TLDR? It's really hard to judge whether an artist is focused on white audiences. It depends on the state of the genre and how blackness is viewed at the time, and can change over the course of the artist's career.

I have some other thoughts brewing but I'll leave it at that. If you're interested, here's an article about shifting attitudes toward Whitney Houston in the Black community: https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jul/07/not-black-enough-the-identity-crisis-that-haunted-whitney-houston"
3588,2020-11-09 09:05:04,jqtaum,"Azealia Banks' comment is foul though. I suspect that Lizzo's size has a lot to do with that mammy comment, considering Azealia's tendency to fat shame other black women artists."
3589,2020-11-09 10:01:31,jqtaum,"I do listen to Lizzo and agree with her, for the most part. I don't let white people and their tastes stop me from liking anyone (I won't go into how I'm sure we have noticed a lot of non-black people latching onto our music, our style, and our ""public figures"" while also not liking/respecting black people as an entire group, but I won't go into that). There's also the fact that Lizzo seems to be aware of how people, especially white women, are treating her like some weird fat blacktivist (expecting her to be their ally simply because she's black and fat; I'll say more on that in a moment) and she's spoken out about it. I think we need to stop being so quick to throw black people, especially women (when so many people do that already), under the bus because of whom chooses to like them; they really don't have much say in that. Lizzo has also spoken about her music being for black people, so again, is it her fault if white people latch onto it? I mean, I remember H.E.R. or Noname, I forget who, said that they make music specifically for black people, yet I see her coming up in a lot of white playlists. Do we feel this way about her, as well? Or are we just shitting on Lizzo because of the added fatphobia, there? And before someone claims that's not it, truly think about it, please. I also don't see this being said about Lauren Hill, who has the same issue and was very clear on her stance on this. We don't see this conversation surrounding Beyonce, either, and we know how white girls latch onto her. Why are we so quick to reject Lizzo, but not other black artists who also have a lot of white fans? I say this because this is not the first time I've seen this exact conversation aimed at Lizzo. Then again, the same was also said of Whitney Houston when she was starting out; why the fascination of if a black artists is more for white ears or black ears? Not saying we shouldn't pay attention, but deciding not to listen to them because of it? Seems weird.

 Azalea Banks is a whole thing of herself. She seems to hate everybody, but she does have *some* good takes, sometimes, if said in a very distasteful way. Almost all her fans are gay white men, so what does she say about that, exactly? What does that make her, then?

Anyway, and this is where I will bring up how black women, especially if they are fat, are often held up a lot by white feminists and white gay men (think about the trope/stereotype of fat black women and white gay men being the best friends in any friend group; it definitely reflects real life), especially. Someone else touched on this, as well, white people who are not the ""norm"" are often empowered by black women living their lives unapologetically, because it seems they feel like, ""if this black woman, the lowest of all humans, who is also not the norm AND is black can be accepted and happy, that means I definitely can, too... in the black community or in the non-black community I've created with my friends/other fans"". Too many times, they step on our (black women, but especially fat black women) shoulders and walk over us to be accepted. Think about how many white gay men are famous right now who literally act like a caricature of a sassy, fat, black woman, but also think how many sassy black women are NOT famous when they are the source of who these gay men act like. Then you have white women who also act like sassy, black, fat women or hood chicks and they are famous influencers, while black women often can't break into that area; we are still often considered ""ghetto"". So, I don't put any of this blame on Lizzo or let what white people have been doing for generations affect if I like her or not. That's a big problem: we let white people come into our spaces or into our culture and then feel the need to reject certain bits because of it. I'm not, because that is literally them throwing their power around even more. You don't let someone come into your home and kick you out of it. Oh and don't even get me started on how white feminists are literally falling all over themselves for Kamala Harris and all the black women who saved their asses again from their own racists selves. The endless ""thank you black women"" posts all over social media are annoying. Because are they going to start treating black women better? I doubt it, so I'm tired of it all."
3590,2020-11-09 09:21:00,jqtaum,"I don’t think Lizzo (or rather her management) marketed specifically towards white people, BUT I think that what is being marketed speaks to white people more than other Black female artists of the last couple years.

The music and image of Lizzo is positive, celebratory, unapologetic in a fun way and in general just really accessible.

What I have noticed in white women consuming Black female artists is that years ago they all loved Beyonce. But at a certain point, Beyonce’s music became less easily accessible and less instantly recognizably celebratory for many of them. This is the part of the market that Lizzo has now come to occupy.

I don’t think this is an active decision. I don’t think this is pandering. I think Lizzo is doing what she loves and it just happens to have this effect.

In my opinion, Azealia Banks’s thoughts on this are valid, but her rhetoric in expressing her views on this may be questionable.

I think it is very healthy to keep looking at white consumerism of Black media and keep discussing it."
3591,2020-11-09 13:53:19,jqtaum,"I like some of Lizzo’s songs and I think she is being her most genuine self but I get why other black women find her cringe. She gives off that sassy, black best friend vibe you see in tv shows and movies."
3592,2020-11-09 09:10:37,jqtaum,[removed]
3593,2020-11-09 11:48:47,jqtaum,"I think the whole fat shaming ideology is white women insecurities about their body images. And just like always, Black women heroes have the divine capacity of love and nurturing so huge, they ultimately take on the pain and hurt of everyone else and become leaders and front runners of a movement that was never theirs in the first place. 

Listen, Brothers love a thick women. We adore and cherish our voluptuous Queens. 

Some critics have even stated, this whole Lizzo thing is apart of a even more larger and sinister propaganda machine to normalize unhealthy eating habits among black women. Like it’s ok to flaunt being overweight and be proud of it. 

The glorification of body images in connection with profiteering off other’s emotional trauma seems to be some new wave phenomenon nowadays."
3594,2020-11-09 12:21:43,jqtaum,">Well yeah, it’s pretty well-established that liking black music or black culture doesn’t necessarily translate to a respect for black people, but I don’t think that’s something that you can hold Lizzo responsible for. She’s an entertainer and how woke her fans are isn’t really something that’s within her control.

Agreed.  I would say this about any and every black entertainer."
3595,2020-11-09 15:00:07,jqtaum,"You are so right, although I hold nothing against Lizzo. She is a talented woman with a positive message. It was about the body positivity aspect of it that white women have co-opted. (I wish I made that point earlier in the post)"
3596,2020-11-09 13:13:07,jqtaum,Mariah carey definitely got these same criticisms back in the day until she started the whole rap/R&b collaboration trend.
3597,2020-11-09 15:04:20,jqtaum,Thank you! I actually have read that article and it’s a good one.
3598,2020-11-09 09:33:17,jqtaum,"None of Azealia Banks’ music has made it to the UK, but a lot of her horrible comments about other artists have. It seems to me that if she spent half as much energy making good music as she does talking shit about other artists she’d probably be a lot more successful."
3599,2020-11-09 12:40:01,jqtaum,"Azealia is an experimental artist who has chosen not to stay within prescribed ""black sounds"". I mean *""Anna Wintour""* is more likely to play in a white gay club than urban radio. Her issue is clearly that Lizzos body fits that marmie trope rather and honestly we need to stop reading what Azealia vomits and just try to get her back into bringing new sounds into hiphop"
3600,2020-11-09 13:15:05,jqtaum,"AB's comment was rude and direct. OP is making the same argument though, she's just not being as succinct. 

AB is problematic but she's not alone with the crabs in a bucket BS."
3601,2020-11-09 16:13:27,jqtaum,"Noname did openly complain about the demographics of her listeners, and ostensibly quit making music because of it. I say ostensibly because she did ether J Cole this summer (feels like a lifetime ago) and she may be working on more material?"
3602,2020-11-09 12:51:12,jqtaum,">But at a certain point, Beyonce’s music became less easily accessible and less instantly recognizably celebratory for many of them.

So true. There's a hilarious [SNL skit](https://youtu.be/ociMBfkDG1w)
capturing the moment white people heard Beyonce's  Formation."
3603,2020-11-09 09:21:54,jqtaum,"Ahh, our edgy troll got bored of Pokemon again"
3604,2020-11-09 13:03:30,jqtaum,"Can we please not paint the black community as  some kind of shangrila of body acceptance. Not when black women have the highest mortality rates from body augmentation procedures. 

>Brothers love a thick women.

Yep. And ""thick"" is very rigidly defined as skinny waist, flat stomach, large bottom. A shape thats unattainable to most woman. I've got news for you, the vast majority of those women on Love and HipHop have had lipo and Brazilian butt lifts. Please lets not invalidate Lizzos personal struggle - *culturally her fat is situated in all the wrong places*. She sings about body positivity because she needs it not because her body is treated as the ideal."
3605,2020-11-09 15:17:22,jqtaum,"Please look into the book *Fearing the Black Body: the racist origins of fatphobia* by Dr. Sabrina Strings (a thin black woman, her book is her PhD thesis and surely seminal imo)"
3606,2020-11-09 12:32:00,jqtaum,True. The only way to super stardom in music is either through white or Latino purchase power.
3607,2020-11-09 16:08:18,jqtaum,"Yeah, I listed the more recent pop ones but I'm sure that's a criticism that was applied to a lot of Black artists that we would now consider quintessentially Black. I mean, did people say the same for Tina Turner, given how rock moved away from Black artists? How does country and bluegrass even fit into this? Those artists definitely face this type of scrutiny, but we do more or less ""welcome them back?"""
3608,2020-11-09 09:56:27,jqtaum,"That's true, she would. She is really talented. But it's hard to root for someone who is so cruel to other black women"
3609,2020-11-09 10:27:57,jqtaum,"> None of Azealia Banks’ music has made it to the UK

That's not true lol. I agree with the rest of your point though, her entire current persona has revolved around her awful dynamics with other artists and tbh the world in general."
3610,2020-11-09 15:01:28,jqtaum,I am by no means agreeing with Banks’ statement.
3611,2020-11-09 16:09:31,jqtaum,That skit is hilarious. I always laugh so hard seeing that.
3612,2020-11-09 12:40:41,jqtaum,"I think about why Dave Chappelle quit his show.  People were laughing but they weren't 'getting the message' he was trying to impart.  

I think his monologue on SNL was on point and edgy for network TV...and yet, you still hear some people complain that it wasn't funny enough.  He has surpassed the need to be funny all the time just to entertain.  He has earned the right to do what he feels to (hopefully)  make people think/be introspective...and of they are entertained by it, that is a bonus."
3613,2020-11-09 16:16:26,jqtaum,"What you described is the ""Mammy"" stereotype: https://www.ferris.edu/jimcrow/mammies/

You very well may not agree with ABs level of disdain, but you are uncomfortable with how Lizzo is placed into the Mammy category by white women."

3643,2020-11-08 03:51:37,jq3jlf,I don't think so. She's epic!
3644,2020-11-08 03:57:11,jq3jlf,"Would the picture be her face? It seems weird to me (to get a tattoo of anyone's face). If you're thinking of doing this, maybe there's another symbol that reflects what you respect about her.

Like the fair fight logo?"
3645,2020-11-08 07:30:32,jq3jlf,"My immediate reaction is to ask about what actions they have taken inspired by her example. Or rather, to ask them to ask themselves. 

If they have made *significant* efforts on behalf of issues like voter registration and combating voter suppression, to further electoral equity & democratic integrity in places like Georgia, or to improve government representation for communities of color anywhere, it’s a little different than if the tattoo were the *first* action they ever take in appreciation of Abrams’s efforts. 

Tokenism is defined as “the practice of making only a perfunctory or symbolic effort to do a particular thing, especially .... in order to give the appearance of sexual or racial equality” 

What are they hoping to convey about *themselves* with this choice?

Definitely something to discuss with their black friends and community members before making such a  decision. 

I’m reminded of the “wannabe woke” white people who sported locs (dreads) in the 90s and how much easier it was for them to change their hair than it would be to remove or cover up a tattoo. 

Also: They wouldn’t want to get the spelling of her name wrong, either! (It’s *Stacey with an “e-y”!)"

Generally when we're talking privilige it makes difference if we're talking the justice system or the media. The media is clearly biased against usually priviliged people as shown as you said in the fact how people believed Heard more than Depp.   
So I don't see why a white woman would be get better treatment by the media than a black woman.   


The examples you mentioned are also related to the justice system. Are there examples of minorities getting treated worse than priviliged people by the media?"

The media stories would be all over the place. Even if you didn’t know who this white girl was l, by the end of the month we’d all know the whole story.

Instead, we got a few stories on TMZ, nobody else in the news bothered to run with it really. The only news outlets that kept following the story were black ones like Breakfast Club. Outside of that....nothing."
3697,2020-11-07 14:41:13,jprs86,"What do you mean get away with? If she were a black woman, she would be a nobody, no one would have listened to her accusations to begin with, and she would have gotten away with it because of anonymity."
3698,2020-11-07 15:55:06,jprs86,"That’s a good point. But the media is also biased too. You remember how the media would talk about how unjust it is to acquit police murdering a black boy but at the same time spread propaganda about him being the aggressor, drug dealer, “Rapist”, etc. because this BLM stuff has been relevant years before you heard of it."
3699,2020-11-07 14:52:46,jprs86,"Exactly, no one would have listened to her or enabled her the power to ruin Johnny’s reputation in the first place.

3700,2020-11-07 15:59:55,jprs86,I mean maybe if we go back in time the media wasn't quite as left wing as it is today. But the depp and heard case is happening right now. And in the climate of both metoo and BLM? I think the media would hundred percent side with the black woman.

You mean like Crystal Mangum?"
3702,2020-11-07 14:55:35,jprs86,What is this idea that Amber Heard is getting away with something? Do you think we are living in a world where we are going about our day giving a fuck about Amber Heard?
3703,2020-11-07 15:12:58,jprs86,Reddit clearly gives a fuck or it wouldn’t have been on front page. Johnny Depp is still losing roles for being a “Wife beater” despite it being disproven while Amber is still getting roles and sympathy. If Johnny Depp’s accuser were a black woman she would not get this same sympathy

Lol. Like in the middle of my 20th time listening to it, that’s when the general thought of the song sinks in lol. And for me that’s okay? I mean, as long as I enjoy the music, melody and rhythm wise ig?"

3733,2020-12-15 11:34:09,kdjyvx,"You are the bad guy.  You sound superficial and dramatic.  You say Kevin was a great guy because he bought you gifts and took you to restaurants.  That's what makes him a great guy!? You say this other girl was REALLY going after him because she was his friend and gave him cookies... So you demanded he cut of contact.  Oh, and he was a ""stalker"" because he went to another girls Instagram account.  That made him a massive liar because he said he DIDNT go to her account. But you dont mind if he stalks people, which is kinda messed up, but I think if your definition of stalking is going to someone's social media then we are alright.  Anyways, I digress.  Then you decided to get petty and upload a video of you and a girlfriend burning all his letters.  Cute.  Honestly, Kevin sounds better off."
3734,2020-12-15 17:57:50,kdjyvx,I understand what u are trying to say. I'm not trying to frame him as a stalker and no he is not a sweet guy because he buys me stuff. That was just an example of the things he does ( just wanted to show y'all that he is actually sweet in that way). It's not a problem that he goes to another girls account. It's that he lied to me about it and little back story (he gets excited to see this particular girl when we have get togethers.) So yes I got annoyed by that. Also about the cookies... He was talking to her behind my back. I really don't know if he was flirting or not but u can't blame me for being insecure about that.. I told him to cut off contact with her because that just made me uncomfortable that he talked to her secretly and tried to keep it a secret too... Anyways thanks for ur reply!!
3735,2020-12-15 14:51:19,kdjyvx,"Agreed... 

Honestly.. You can just explain to him can you do the letters every once in awhile they are so nice but I want to have a letter  for when I need it or something.

Your best friend is probably jealous. Trust me... any girl I’ve dated until I was 24ish had a best friend that gets annoyed when the other person gets into a relationship unless they are also in a good relationship.keyword good relationship that they see a future with. It sounds like your best friend is jealous by the way she threw up the idea to burn the letters and dance on tik Tok.  It was her way of claiming you. She knew he would see. Your best friend isn’t dumb.

Kevin is a people pleaser and he doesn’t want to get you upset. I had to go therapy to fix this. I still people please but not in a toxic way.

Once he controls the people pleasing. The lying will stop. It stopped for me. Then you will get all the good parts of a people pleaser.

He is very attentive. He will be that way his whole life. He will be a great husband and dad. Source I am 30 and I was that guy. 

Maybe Kevin isn’t the right guy for you but I wouldn’t be surprised if 5 years down the road when you want to get married and settle down you have a change of heart. Men and women would kill for that type of person.

Therapy will solve the emotional part. Have you sat him down and ask him about his childhood. Typically this stems from parents that show lack of Love / affection to their children. I am talking physical touch, loving words type stuff not buying things. 

Maybe try and understand Kevin. If he doesn’t get better and doesn’t respect your boundaries then dump him but this all seems small in the grand scheme of things.

Read the posts here. People would kill for a Kevin.

The only thing that sounds off is the head thing but he might just be immature."
3736,2020-12-16 01:21:25,kdjyvx,"I was married to my own Kevin for 28 years. I know exactly what you mean. When someone loves you obsessively, and still lies about stuff in fear of losing you, it gets old. My parents and sisters all thought he was an angel for putting up with me. He’d call my parents if I talked about leaving, because I clearly wasn’t making good decisions. I got married at 20, and left him at 48. We have two grown sons, so we maintain a good friendship, but by the end there was no romantic feeling left at all, on my end. I adore my sons, so I wouldn’t necessarily change anything, but I can strongly say that you’re doing the right thing. You’re young, and you don’t need to justify your actions to anyone.  Be strong, you’re worth it."
3737,2020-12-15 18:19:57,kdjyvx,"Thank you for this... Seriously!! And yes Kevin is a people pleaser but I've given him time to work on himself... I think he and I both need a break from this relationship and I need to work on myself too. 

About the burning letters tik tok, you are right... My mom and dad said the same thing about my friend. That she was just jealous. I remember back when Kevin and I was dating and I would tell her how much I love him, she'd say negative things like  ""it's not going to last. It's just for a few months. You hate him after a while"" and other stuff. Putting all these pieces  together I figured that out myself too but obviously Im too late.

Also no he did get a lot of love and affection as a child. I've talk to him about it and I've seen how much his mother loves him and cares for him. She babies him all the time...

The head thing was just one of the many wierd incidents that has happened. There's actually several other incidents that's made me realise he doesn't really understand the concept of ""consent"". But as u said he is immature... Anyways thanks for the reply!!"

Idk much about Lizzo because I don't follow her but obviously she seems to be really talented and overall a pretty funny person so SUPER good on her for doing what's best for herself- she doesn't deserve being called fatphobic for literally just loosing weight so she can be happy and healthy"
3790,2020-12-15 17:26:48,kdbk8d,"I am fat.  I, like arguably 90% of fat people, chose it.  I chose to be fat through a sedentary lifestyle, poor food choices, and over eating.  I know I'm fat.  I know it was my choice to be fat.  That said, the American way of life, too much food, bad food, excess sugar, being sedentary, takes some of the blame.  I'd give it 40% of the blame.

I, like probably most fat people, understand that me being fat is due to my actions, or lack thereof.  People do not like to take credit for the bad things that happen.  People don't like to be the bad guy.  People don't like to be responsible for themselves when their actions cause negative consequence.  People don't like to be called fat.  It hurts.  It reminds them of their own failures.  It sucks.  Being fat sucks.

I'm fairly certain that the term fatphobe came about in order to make fat people more happy with their chosen lifestyle/body choices, and for those who are fat for genuine medical/genetic reasons.  For those in the latter category, you deserve to call people who are ugly to you and berate you for being fat, fatphobic.  But for the other 90% of us?  No, we deserve it to an extent.  

We can't change the American diet overnight.  We can't change that our processed food has so much sugar in it that it makes us fat even if we exercise.  We can't change any of that, at least not quickly.  But we can change what we eat.  How much we eat.  How much exercise we get.  Is it hard?  Fuck yea it is.  I'm doing it now.  It is incredibly hard.  I've only started the dietary changes and have added a little more exercise to my life and it is not easy.  I get it.  I commend anyone who puts in effort to change their life this way. 

Lizzo gets that admiration.  She's trying.  She's putting in the work.  That's not fatphobic.  It's only fatphobic to fat people who don't want to take responsibility for themselves or their actions."
3791,2020-12-15 19:34:39,kdbk8d,"Genuinely think body positivity has gone too far. I love my body, so I feed it and exercise it because both are essential for health. If I decide it would benefit my mental and physical health if I lost some weight and I'm not underweight in the first place, I have every right to do so. If you're truly 'body positive', you'll do everything you can to look after your body and keep it healthy.

Everyone knows detox juice is an instagram scam a lot of celebrities get paid to promote. Everyone loved her videos of exercising and eating healthy vegan foods for instance, it's just detox isn't a healthy way to go at it, especially for people with eating disorders, which I expect theres a lot of people like that in lizzos self love insta audience."

3840,2020-12-15 20:37:16,kdbk8d,Some people are definitely also angry she's losing weight though. the HAES/FA crowd thinks that merely exercising is fatphobic and that a fat person not wanting to be fat anymore is a direct attack on all other fat people. Just visit r/fatlogic and you'll see tons of examples.

This is all because of the fruit and pills detox which by the way only made her lose her water weight and it's just not a healthy choice at all. There are a few doctors on IG talking about how unhealthy it is, check drjoshuawolrich stories if you don't believe me and would like to learn more about how unhealthy these scam diets are."
3844,2020-12-18 20:03:37,kdbk8d,"That's not true, people are mad at he because she spent a long time promoting self love and harnessed a long audience of people with eating disorders and is now marketing juice and pill detox which is a scam."
3845,2020-12-15 16:28:34,kdbk8d,Yep. Guess they are just going to have to unfollow her to prevent getting upset.
3846,2020-12-15 21:59:13,kdbk8d,"I've seen it with my own two eyes. Sure, MOST people are upset because of the detox pills but don't fucking gaslight me. There absolutely are people who are upset just because she wants to lose weight. There were screenshots of people on twitter getting upset when she posted videos of herself doing yoga because it was ""fatphobic"" of her to do. Just because you haven't seen those specific tweets/callouts doesn't mean it's not happening."
3847,2020-12-18 20:45:26,kdbk8d,"Yeah I know it's a scam. I work for people who needs a diet change. Besides, okay, it's good to be againts eating disorders, but being obese is no healthy either. Last 10 people i've talked to and helped, 6 out of 10 had stroke."

You're attempting to put yourself above me by making me out to be emotional/irrational as a defense mechanism, so that you don't actually have to think about and address the content of what I'm communicating to you.

What I've seen with my own eyes, really happened. You don't get to tell me that it's ""not true"". If I said, ""I ate a banana for breakfast today."" You'd be gaslighting me by saying, ""That's not true"". This post is literally proof that people are doing it. There ARE people trying to cancel her simply for wanting to lose weight, regardless of the method."

3858,2020-12-15 01:34:03,kdbhzu,Not dying before 30 phobia is so terrible why do these people show me pictures of them going from almost extremely obese to regular weight now I feel like I am fat. Blablablabla if Twitter required you to walk for 10 minutes before opening the app these people wouldn’t even post.

Delete Twitter and go outside for a walk.
3863,2020-12-15 03:54:31,kdagb0,She already began posting light work out videos and people were pissy then. Can't they just leave people alone? Maybe she's trying to extend her lifespan.

Uj/ Yes"
3907,2020-12-13 22:52:25,kcfhbr,"Ehhh.. I think she certainly used to promote an unhealthy view in the past. Like how you can be doing well when you're obese when the reality is that you can't. If you're obese (not fat), then you're not doing well. Period. Your physical health is taking a toll with all that excessive weight as long as you have it. 

I definitely think she's trying to promote a more healthier lifestyle nowadays, so I'll give her that. I just think it's important to note that if you're obese, and not just fat that losing weight is essential for well being and that you can't be truly healthy while obese although you can certainly do healthy things like exercising and going on a good diet to become healthy."
3908,2020-12-13 18:26:40,kcfhbr,I forgot about lizzo ever since she was roasted on Twitter
3909,2020-12-13 18:19:55,kcfhbr,"The issue I take with her is that if a fit, white woman wore the things she does and did the things she does, she'd be heavily criticized (no pun intended, but I'll keep it). For some reason, anything she does is body positivity, whereas if someone else did it, it'd be slutty or inappropriate."
3910,2020-12-13 18:16:55,kcfhbr,👏👏👏
3911,2020-12-13 18:47:47,kcfhbr,"I think lizzo has a very healthy attitude.  

I once heard an interview with her,  and the interviewer told her she was brave for posing nude. She didn't even skip a beat - she just said,  ""why, because I'm fat? Would you tell a skinny person they were brave for taking off their clothes?"" I was like... daaaaaaamn. 

And I recently read a piece that pointed out the difference between lizzo's message and other ""self-love"" music/ songs... ""I bought it,"" ""no matter what you say..."" and lizzo is just saying,  ""I'm so cool.  I'm so that bitch.  I'm gonna marry myself."" 

And, as someone who used to be FAT and lost a LOT of weight,  you can't get healthy and maintain a healthy lifestyle out of self loathing. I was a serial yo-yo dieter until i decided, fuck it,  I'm just going to love myself as i am.  Since i love myself, I'm going to take care of this person that i love.  And over two years of simply taking care because i learned to love myself, i lost 140+ pounds, resolved multiple health issues, and abs have maintained that lifestyle - because it's not about hating myself it's about loving myself. 

So her message means a lot to me. 

I think she promotes a lot of good feelings and sends love. (Also,  she's so fucking talented)"

3913,2020-12-13 18:34:47,kcfhbr,"Workout routines my hairy arse. She's fat. She absolutely does promote unhealthy lifestyles, there was an article in some magazine attempting to normalise obesity because of her. It costs billions a year to treat obesity related illnesses. You could literally save the NHS by getting all the greedy lazy people to stop stuffing their faces."

3915,2020-12-14 09:39:00,kcfhbr,Can confirm. Am obese. My knees literally right this moment are screaming in agreement.
3916,2020-12-13 19:13:31,kcfhbr,Oh where she publicly accused that postMates driver of “stealing her food” when in fact Lizzo wouldn’t answer the phone? Also let’s be honest we know the type of person she is based on her song Truth Hurts
3917,2020-12-13 19:14:08,kcfhbr,By who? I missed this.
3918,2020-12-13 18:36:33,kcfhbr,"And I think we should speak out against that. 

Rather than saying lizzo SHOULDN'T because others would be shamed (I don't think you're saying that, but others might) we should say that people are allowed to express themselves as they feel comfortable."
3919,2020-12-13 18:51:51,kcfhbr,"Did SHE say she wanted to normalize obesity? Or was it the magazine? Also, like I said, she’s overweight, but that doesn’t mean shes a slob who sits around and eats all day. There ARE people like that, but I don’t think she’s one of them."
3920,2020-12-13 18:58:20,kcfhbr,"She's lost 50lbs.

It's really important to remember that rapid weight loss is rarely healthy or sustainable.  

As a society, we tend to look down on ALL fat people, without knowing what's actually going on in someone's life.  Someone who weighs 300lbs may have weighed 400 a year ago.  

Do i think we should encourage a 400lb person to stay that way because they're perfect the way they are? Oh hell no!!! 

It's also important to consider the source. Is LIZZO saying we should normalize obesity,  or is a magazine taking a photo and single quote, and saying to normalize obesity?

After being really fat, and now only being a little fat, I'm sympathetic to people who are living themselves and doing their best,  so,  yes,  my comment is biased."

But i wouldn't shame a friend or family member for how they chose to dress/dance when socializing, and wouldn't expect them to be representing anyone but themselves when out in public.

Celebrities have the strange position of being in the public eye,  while for most of us,  a family event is a public as it gets."

Gen Z~ Emma Chamberlain, Elle Fanning, Robert Capron, Judah Lewis.

Millennials~ Josh Hutcherson, Chloe Moretz, Josh Peck, Philip Van Dyke, Evan Peters, Bill Skarsgard, Annasophia Robb.

Anyways shit keeps coming out of my dick and it fucking hurts and I tried asking my doctor for help and he just got super horny and started jerkin me off and then I came shit all over him and then he forced himself on me and called me a little twink and he started licking my feet the toes and soles and he jerked off and came a massive load of hot cum all over my meaty boy soles and arches and then filmed it and posted it on Youtube for the world to see and now that was weird but kinda hot idk but i'm just dickpooping even more and I dont know what to do I could get a new doctor but I tried that and he caught me I think my dad is in cahoots with him cuz I saw him talking to my dad but anyways he caught me and took me to the backroom of the doctors office and started nutting all over my face and playing with my nipples and someone was jerking off watching it I think it was my dad but I can't say for sure but I did notice once he was taking videos of my bare feet without my permission so who knows but anyways I doubt it. Davie Cocker could be taking it to gain executive experience, in which case you might be right. But he's young, he's hungry, and I don't think he'd voluntarily sign up to spend the next four years approving shit themed porn films and anal prolapse glory holes. My suspicion is that rectal infrastructure is going to be a huge, early push of my fathers, both by itself and as a way to stimulate my penis with a cattle prod in order to force me to cum for him in front of my entire family. Yes, mom, dad, my brother, my sisters, and even grandpa and grandma, and the family dog and my doctor licking my feet and everyone jerking off to cum all over my feet. This will put Lindsay Graham into the white house for sure, square in the public eye and, if successful, I think twink boypussy would become a national currency for all straight, hetero white male straight men who will force themselves upon my sexy, naked twink body and boy feet. But anyways as I was saying, don't stop believing, never forget that feeling, don't stop believing, you gotta hold onto that feeling. Yup, that's what my grandfather told me, the only person who never put his cock inside me. And it's a damn shame he didn't because that sure was a nice cock he had jerked all over my face with."
3956,2020-12-12 22:34:08,kbw3u1,"I would agree that some of the things you have described are problematic and hypocritical. 

But I would also argue that these people don’t represent the majority of the movement and are rather the vocal majority. 

Most people that I, personally, are know who are part of the fat acceptance movement understand that no one is obligated to find them attractive. They understand it’s unhealthy, but for one reason or another, they have been unable to loose weight (sometimes due to medical conditions, sometimes not). They just want their value as a human to be defined by everything about them rather than simply their weight. You can be a great singer, or actor, or comedian and be overweight. The fat girls you see on tinder may be incredibly smart and talented people, but struggle with their weight. Writing them off as “bringing nothing to table” is exactly the kind of thing people are fighting against. 

Additionally, the are plenty of things famous people do that are incredibly bad for you me health and can be impressed on children who look up to them. Drugs, alcohol, and other self-destructive behaviors are more than common in celebrities. It’s the job of parents to monitor what media their children are consuming and establish what is healthy and what is not. 

You dont have to be attracted to them, but then being fat or you being disgusted by their appearance doesn’t give you the right to be an asshole to them. Too many people who are heavy or overweight or obese get attacked constantly about it, even when that has nothing to do with the quality of their work. If a fat woman hits on you, you can turn her down, but turn her down nicely, just like you should for anyone you are turning down. They should accept with grace and if they get mad at you for it— then they’re an asshole. 

TLDR; yes some of the people in the movement are misguided assholes, but that doesn’t discredit the entire movement. Everyone should just be nice to everyone and respect other people’s feelings and opinions."
3957,2020-12-12 22:52:50,kbw3u1,So many down votes happening here...its like some redditors are personally offended...I wonder what the correlation is...certainly not the hypocrisy of going too an off my chest to suppress diverse opinion. That would be crazy....
3958,2020-12-13 03:23:16,kbw3u1,I’m fat and agree that the loud people in the movement are an issue.
3959,2020-12-12 20:42:02,kbw3u1,"Basically, women recognized that most men (and people in general) are attracted to women who are not obese. Obesity is not seen as attractive by most men and women. 

So the intelligent response would be to say, “If I want a man to be attracted to me, I should lose weight.” And that’s fair. No one is required to love you or be attracted to you. No one owes you a relationship. If you want a relationship, you need to make yourself desirable to the people you desire. 

But that would mean working hard. So instead of rising to meet men’s standards  (the vast majority of which aren’t even high standards), a lot of women instead demand that men lower their standards. 

You see this a lot with the whole “slut shaming” thing too. Most men don’t want to date women who have an OnlyFans or who have slept with hundreds of people. But instead of meeting those standards, women demand that men change their standards. 

The harsh truth is that no one on this planet has to be attracted to you."
3960,2020-12-12 20:24:51,kbw3u1,"Oooh you gon' get roasted. Stop speaking the truth, man. Reddit doesn't do reality checks. Btw I completely agree."
3961,2020-12-12 20:27:14,kbw3u1,"Damn you might get roasted for this. But honestly, I agree. Sometimes I feel guilty about thinking fat people are kinda gross...Im sorry. I just cant be attracted to someone who is fat."
3962,2020-12-12 20:22:36,kbw3u1,Preach. That last sentence hit the hardest. Keep up the good work
3963,2020-12-12 22:41:05,kbw3u1,"The fat acceptance movement is about making those of us who carry around too much weight not feel shame everywhere we go. I KNOW I'm fat. I don't need assholes making jokes, watching me eat, or making me feel like shit in general. I am WELL AWARE that I am overweight. Fat acceptance is about getting judgmental people to stop staring, making comments, and making fat people feel like they don't belong. We all know we are not ""normal."" We do not need you judging us, and there's absolutely no reason in the world for you to do so. I cannot magically do something about my weight to make it go away right then and there, so your judgment does not help. And you have no idea what is going on with that person - maybe they're is working hard to lose weight. How would you know?  

Here's a little story from my past: years ago I decided to lose weight by biking around my neighborhood in the morning. Part of my route took me on a major street so traffic was coming up behind me, and part of this route was up hill, so I was peddling hard and I'm sure it was sight to behold from behind. I heard a truck coming up behind me and as it passed, one of the guys leaned out a window and yelled something in Spanish and laughed like a maniac. I have never felt shittier and more self-conscious in my life. And it didn't motivate me. I never rode again. I had plenty of excuses why - it was cold, it was dark out, etc. but in truth I stopped because I didn't want to be made a joke again. I want you to think about that when you feel like mounting your high horse and judging others.

Life is hard for everyone. Just like you, I just want to get through my day. Just like everyone else. Most people don't get judged on a daily, sometimes hourly basis. The judgmental attitude doesn't help. It doesn't motivate. So, no, you can't tell someone they're overweight. Decent human beings don't do things like that. If it's a friend, be accepting of them as they are. If they want help, they will let you know - if they know you're not a judgmental asshole. If it's someone you don't know, stay the fuck out of it because it is NOT your business. 

And get out of here with that insurance business - if you think that fat people are why insurance costs so much, you are very naïve. Even if everyone was perfectly healthy, insurance would cost what it costs now because they can get away with it. 

And lay off the ""fat women only want fit men"" bullshit, too - that is deep into incel territory."
3964,2020-12-13 05:21:36,kbw3u1,"That's just it though, they don't take it gracefully and after they bitch at me their gal pals will bitch at me for the rest of the night about how I'm out of line for not giving their fat friend a chance.  Their looks don't bother me as much as their attitude and their sense of entitlement.  I have also noticed that fat reason have really pretentious standards for men and will make fun of guys for being too short, too skinny and yes....to fat."
3965,2020-12-12 22:40:13,kbw3u1,"This is the entire thing. It was supposed to be about not treating people like shit just because you’re not attracted to them.

Many overweight people are actively seeking to change their lives, and while they’re still in that process of course they don’t want to be mocked. It’s just gonna discourage them.

It is not up to other people to change someone, and for some reason people just can’t keep their nose in their own business and not be a jerk to people they don’t find hot."

3974,2020-12-12 20:50:34,kbw3u1,Disgust at the appearance of fat people is a natural response across cultures and around the globe. Fat people represent a failure in physical form
3975,2020-12-12 20:39:30,kbw3u1,"appreciate it, I saw one of the women I was describing on a talk show making all kinds of demands for any man that wanted to date her and when the host asked what she brought to the table she smugly replied, ""I AM the table"".  She was telling the truth if she was referring to her girth."
3976,2020-12-13 05:09:39,kbw3u1,"I don't think you really took the time to read my post as I'm pretty sure I acknowledged that it is not good to make fun of people for their weight.  Sorry but if you are so weak that one comment from some stranger is going to make you fold up and crumble but if that is the case you really have a lot of work to do on yourself.  Mexican working class men from Mexico whistle and yell at anything female between the ages of 10 and 60 so get over yourself.  So I have a question for you, what stopped you from working out at home after you decided you did not want to go on a bicycle ride?  It sounds like you are full of excuses.

I get so sick of women complaining about how hard it is to lose fat.  You want to try something really hard?  Try packing on lean muscle mass, that's a lot harder than simply losing excess fat.  Losing fat is a really simple equation, burn more calories than you eat.  If you are to lazy to exercise then stop your bitching.

Finally, yes there are a lot of fat women who say they are only attracted to muscle guys but they would never date a fat guy.  And simply pointing out what I have observed and experienced does not make me an incel as you put it.  Again I don't think you read my post as I made it pretty clear that I am a muscular guy who gets approached by fat women who act like they are doing me some kind of favor.  They are arrogant and their shitty attitudes are even more of a turnoff than their looks.

Did I ever say that health insurance was expensive?  I didn't, however my point was that the problems caused directly by obesity such as heart disease, diabetes and high blood pressure are costing us about $150 billion dollars per year.  Or are you going to try and argue that being fat does not lead to being unhealthy?"
3977,2020-12-13 05:25:38,kbw3u1,"So then yes, the women that you have interacted with are rude and annoying."
3978,2020-12-13 03:22:02,kbw3u1,"Yeah, because it’s true."
3979,2020-12-13 04:31:44,kbw3u1,"By the way, I don’t know if your username is a joke but I like it."
3980,2020-12-13 04:56:15,kbw3u1,"I’d guess so, yeah."
3981,2020-12-12 22:42:30,kbw3u1,"It is a different topic but I mostly agree with you. People are free to make those choices for themselves, but others are also free to walk away because of those choices.

The part I disagree with is when you said: “it isn’t about lowering you standards, but accepting someone with a much higher sexual drive.” For many it would be a lowering of standards, it isn’t seen as a “healthy” thing to be extremely promiscuous with many partners, but it is their choice to do so.

This except from a article I found on the web is relevant: “Promiscuity is formally defined, according to Webster, as including not only frequent but ""indiscriminate"" sexual behavior. Preference for frequent sexual contacts is not necessarily the same as being sexually indiscriminating. The latter, in women, indicates a possible compulsive, and therefore, pathological quality to the excessive sexual behavior, referred to traditionally as nymphomania. (In men, it is called satyriasis.)” the whole thing is worth reading if you have the time though, I think you would agree: www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/evil-deeds/201111/what-motivates-sexual-promiscuity%3Famp

I would also say attitudes about promiscuity vary greatly between cultures, so I can only really speak from my own cultural experience. I think it depends on the person but generally, most people, man or woman, would view their long-term, serious partner having a large number of other sexual partners as a negative.

Obviously this dynamic changes depending on what type of relationship you are looking for, and between groups of people and individuals. For example among a group of men, an individual man might be celebrated for having a high body count, but if that same man shared his high body count with a group of women he would likely be shamed. However both those groups would probably react negatively for a woman with a high body count."
3982,2020-12-13 05:29:19,kbw3u1,"Completely agree but for some reason, unlike someone who is killing themselves with alcohol, drugs or even cigarettes we are supposed to put their feelings and ego before everything else including common sense.

I also love the way women try to shame men who are not attracted to fat women and dismiss them as being shallow.  The truth is men are repulsed by the sight of fat women for a reason that is a lot more basic and is encoded into our DNA and has to do with survival.  Men are programmed to be sexually attracted to a woman who will be healthy enough to give birth and help him raise those children.  An obese woman is going to die a premature death as a mother if she does not die in childbirth after gaining even more weight.  This is no different than women being attracted to tall muscular men yet you don't see men trying to shame them for that."
3983,2020-12-13 00:07:55,kbw3u1,"This has not always been true. It is unhealthy, but historically [being fat was thought of as a sign of health and wealth](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17045228/) because you could afford to eat enough. [There are sculptures](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_of_Willendorf) thought to represent a goddess of fertility, that is clearly obese.

She expanded on that with an even more classic house sound in songs like Anna Wintour. You rarely hear late 80s early 90s club/rave culture referenced by anyone other than artists firmly planted within the world of dance music. I think it would have been very interesting having someone like Azealia making her style of music without being relegated to the fringes due to her many personal failings

4128,2020-12-29 20:04:31,kmgr0o,She also pointed out that the reason all these basic white women love Lizzo so much is because they don't feel threatened by her iirc
4129,2020-12-29 21:03:38,kmgr0o,isn’t the mammy stereotype nurturing and something of a surrogate mother? lizzo doesn’t strike me as having those sorts of qualities. she’s doing the bad bitch/ho thing
4130,2020-12-29 23:00:04,kmgr0o,Thats funny that she says that because it seems like any relevance that Azalea currently has comes from her giving terminally online white women the vicarious experience of being friends with New York from Flavor of Love.

4140,2020-12-30 07:36:00,kmgr0o,I think she's a mammy stereotype but adopted and updated to her millenniall audience and for that audience the bad bitch persona is precisely the type of mammy they're looking for. A cool (in their eyes) kinda mammy where the nurture is expressed through empowerment rather than loving care.

4142,2020-12-29 04:25:20,km6e2p,"I have major double chin insecurity (double chinsecurity?)-- I have kind of a sloping chin so I've always felt like my face looks way too big from the side. I used to always sit with my elbow on the table and my hand under my chin to try to hide it until I was told by someone that they never would have even noticed if I wasn't drawing attention to it.

I think double chinsecurity is tough and always seems bigger than it is because it's one of the only things about our bodies that we can't hide. Which can sound like kind of a bummer but on the other hand, every compliment you've ever gotten (in person, at least) has been from someone who either (A) sees your double chin or (B) never thought to notice your double chin. Sometimes compliments about our shape or hair or makeup can feel hollow because we've spent time making all of those things look that way but there's no quick fix for your chin. That just means everyone who loves you and your beautiful face can see your chin and loves it anyway.

All of that said, loving it is a tough hurdle to get over. I've started leaning more toward body neutrality than body positivity in some aspects of how I look which has helped me feel much more content. I had a friend who had a baby and made a point to say ""I'm not going to pretend I love my stretch marks, I'm not going to call them my *tiger stripes* or insist that I think they're beautiful, but having them doesn't make me less valuable or less worthy of the things I want."" For me, it's easier to come to terms with things that way than to force myself to emphatically praise something that's been an insecurity for my whole life."
4143,2020-12-29 20:23:55,km6e2p,"I'm so glad I'm not the only one who has self-image issues with double chins, and wants to improve."
4144,2020-12-30 06:01:14,km6e2p,"I definitely don’t love my double chin but i don’t think about it much 

I always smile big so in photos you can definitely see it pop out
I just come to the point we’re i feel like my smile is more noticeable then my chin 
Also I’m noticeably fat so what’s the point in trying to hide my self.


Also there is a lot of models who have lipo or kybella on their chins. 
It’s never worth comparing yourself to people who are professionally photoshopped"
4145,2020-12-29 04:31:56,km6e2p,"Double chinsecurity is the best word ever!! Also yes, I never thought about how it’s the one thing we can’t hide about our bodies. Your words about loving your face are so wholesome and thank you for that. I never thought of it that way, because when I see myself it’s like the only thing I see. 

Oh I am so ignorant to this whole body neutrality thing and I feel like that is way more my speed than body positivity. I used to be able to hide my double chin in photos better but now that I’m at my highest weight to date I feel like it’s inescapable. Since I’ve been doing a lot of zoom and FaceTiming I can’t really hide it there either so I’m trying to come around to just not being mad that it’s there and that I can’t get rid of it."
4146,2020-12-29 22:46:44,km6e2p,Yes friend you are 1000000% not alone with this
4147,2020-12-29 04:42:15,km6e2p,"I totally get that! My laptop camera is inexplicably in the bottom corner of the screen and I never thought that would be an issue until this year. Every time I zoom, I sit on the floor with my computer on the bed to try not to be seen from that angle. 😂 It's tough to come around on; even if everyone else is used to what we look like, being confronted with it so much more frequently is kind of jarring. I have to assume most people have struggled with that at least a little."
4148,2020-12-29 04:47:21,km6e2p,"Oh my god, I would have to imagine!! I actually bought a separate web cam so I can position it in such a way that’s more flattering but still when I smile and laugh there’s that double chinsecurity comin straight at me again. That’s why there’s this small little voice that’s like “maybe one day when you make enough money you can get a surgery to remove it and you never have to deal with it again” but the odds of that happening are very very unlikely 😅"

4181,2021-01-03 01:28:40,km013l,"Man that sucks. The closest thing to being around someone who made comments on weight were always really fringe people in my life luckily but even after short bursts around them I'd feel less ... sunshiney that's for sure haha so growing up with that must have been a challenge.

All I'd say is be around people who like themselves and say positive things. I once heard a therapist say some studies had found one of the methods that helped people develop healthier mindsets was putting them around others who had healthy mindsets -- we absorb what we are around to an extent. So I think finding body positive friends is a really good first step, hearing people who reference their body in positive and loving ways will sink in definitely. Give yourself permission to disconnect from interactions with people disparaging about their bodies and selves and put yourself around very loving and positive people. Me personally, I tend to avoid people who make disparaging comments about anyone's appearance including their own as I don't feel it's healthy to be around. 

I wish you well in the coming year! :D"

They exist, and I’ve heard they can be super helpful. I also think the great ladies over at r/PlusSize would have some more tips for you if you don’t get much here! Thanks for sharing."
4183,2021-01-17 00:51:59,km013l,"It sounds like because your mother suffered from disordered eating herself, she projected her own insecurities onto you. So generational trauma might be the route cause of a lot of your hardships? It's not your fault, and you deserve to heal and break the cycle.

It's good that you're seeing a therapist as for better physical health, you need to nurture your mental health too. Once you learn to love or appreciate yourself you will refrain from disordered eating and substance abuse, not because you want to look a certain way but because you want to take care of your body and not inflict any more pain onto it. So if your body does change, you're in no way doing a disservice to the body positive movement, you're just breaking away from the habits that have been hurting you.

Definitely keep utilising the help of professionals (therapists, nutritionists etc) who can help you on your journey. You shouldn't have to do this alone. And congratulations on your sobriety 😊"

So if you want to be seen by someone who sees you as a person rather than a number on a scale, nutritionists who follow HAES are a great resource."

4190,2020-12-28 17:41:21,klue7z,Lizzo could definitely work but the person who you'd probably get compared to most is Faye Jackson.

youre larger than life

heel jokes and comments get a verbal smack back 

big moves for you but if youre able a good high spot from the ropes that would give the audience a wow factor

id even incorporate something along the lines of lizzos rapid fire flute and STFU element to it"
4192,2020-12-28 22:59:29,klue7z,"I mean the Honkey Tonk Man basically made a living imitating a music icon. What are you going to do though smash a flute over someone's head instead of a guitar? Do you know how to gimmick an instrument?

Legally if you got more famous I'm not sure what would happen. After all by the time the Honkey Tonk Man became a thing Elvis had been dead for half a decade, plus he started the gimmick in Canada, and Lizzo is still alive. So you may have to change certain things? But that's beyond my pay grade. Good luck either way."
4193,2020-12-28 19:36:33,klue7z,"I have no clue who this Lizzo person is, but when I think of a musical artist, do keep in mind that currently Elias is still on one of the biggest wrestling shows. So try to steer away from anything related to an acoustic guitar at least would be my advice! I even hear people still compare rapper gimmicks to early John Cena too. If you have something in mind, see if there is something like it done in recent history to make sure you can be unique instead of being compared!"
4194,2020-12-30 21:54:25,klue7z,"I think kids would really gravitate towards a Lizzo gimmick --she's silly and colorful, but also conveys power and self-confidence. I don't know if this will make sense, but I think the way she ""brands"" herself is a cool aspect of the character (like how she gives her flute a name, shows her fans the ""Lizzo way"" of doing things like training, getting ready, etc. on social media, etc."

4199,2020-12-29 18:20:19,klue7z,Thanks. Again its just comparisons that I constantly hear. I was just wondering if I could develop it more. Maybe I should just keep doing what I'm doing.

Hell Maxwell Chicago wrestles as a 1960s lounge singer in a Tuxedo.

4203,2020-12-28 23:04:58,klue7z,"True. She's branching away from her original Faye Jackson character and embracing a more serious role (ironically) as captain of the Creepsquad. The thing I think Lizzo has that's captivating is how mutli-talented she is.  She's a classically trained musician who can sing, rap and do a full-split. Maybe emphasis the ""triple-threat"" aspect of your character."

4368,2020-12-26 22:49:56,kkopcf,"Yes, it’s advertised with 21 songs and we’ve gotten 18 so far. They seemingly inadvertently advertised the pack with a song that isn’t out yet, so we’re assuming it’s coming next week as part of the last 3-song wave."

4374,2020-12-26 21:09:42,kkopcf,Yes you can still purchase all the songs separately.
4375,2020-12-26 21:04:58,kkopcf,"Yeah it just means the bundle will go away, all the songs will still be available on their own."
4376,2020-12-26 23:49:52,kkopcf,I was confused with the other song they have from post malone.
4377,2020-12-26 23:13:30,kkopcf,What's the post malone song that's been out forever? We bought the $100 version when it came out. I've had that song forever.
4378,2020-12-26 23:54:09,kkopcf,Just felt like it was hard to use it in any songs. I never put it in any crates anymore.
4379,2020-12-26 21:07:02,kkopcf,They were probably going to release a new pass for next year for people to buy just like in rock band.

You can be overweight and be extremely attracttive, its all encompasimg with a nice face and good personality too tho. People that drool over muscle only think about the physique which is shallow. Also looking at lizzo as just her fat is shallow. Attractiveness comes from your personality and your facial proportions equally when you have weight on you and that is something that either gender MUST keep up with. While someone with an ugly face but 'hot bod' steryotypically doesn't have to do much maintenance. You are focusing on that ideal but don't focus on the shallowness of one of them. It is wrong to compare the two because they are very different. The idea of attraction between the two is at a base focus level for one and all encompassing for another. This is the hard truth. 

Large men are very in style these days in honesty for people that are not apart of that shallow crowd. Its mostly MEN that want to see men with muscles and abs and shame those who don't. women that aren't shallow don't really care about that more often than not as long as you are healthy and have a good personality. many many women see people such as Jack Black, Kevin James, Gabriel Iglaseous, etc to be peak male form. 

I myself am only strictly attracted to chubbiness. I think skinny guys AND muscle guys look disgusting. my fiance is soft and warm and chubby and has a beautiful face ans the sweetest funniest attitude ever. That's all encompassing and that makes him attractive. 

I however am the stereotypical hourglass figure girl that men drool over and judge If I gain weight. after being fat for years I've lost weight. the kicker?? At both points I was judged as a female that my WORTH was boiled down to those looks as I was nothing morr than a sex object to be seen. I was unattractive before getting to even be my friend because that's all an ugly Woman is boiled down to. an ugly man is at least seen as his personality, intellect or jokes. I never got that option."

I myself have always been muscular because I'm really into working out.  I can relate to the sense of irony you feel about your physique and the people it attracts.  It always made me a little sad when I would get shallow women who were also not very smart that. were only attracted to my body but could care less about the fact that my personality and intelligence are 2 of my better attributes.   The reason I work out is it is my escape and it is also my outlet to release all of life's frustrations but I never did it to ""look good"".  It's good do know that there are some women out there who are not demanding that a man look like Thor before she will consider dating him."

In particular, I think that James' verse uses the trope of hip-hop rapping about beauty to celebrate a beauty in the language of the genre, but one that is also male. And I find a lot of other songs that resemble this often center the women's (and partner's) desire for and fulfilment in submission and dominance, where this song celebrates erotic beauty and joyous pleasure:

>Um, you're packed and you're stacked 'specially in the back    
> Brother, wanna thank your mother for a butt like that (thanks, Mom)    
> Can I get some fries with that shake-shake boobie    
> If looks could kill you would be an Uzi    
> Or a shotgun - bang! What's up with that thang?    
> I wanna know, How does it hang?    
> Straight up, wait up, hold up, Mr. Lover    
> Like Prince said you're a sexy motha-    
> Well-a, I like 'em real wild, b-boy style by the mile    
> Smooth black skin with a smile    
> Bright as the sun, I wanna have some fun

4430,2020-12-23 07:15:37,kikvuh,"There are a few of songs from men that I think have a nuanced opinion on some aspect of masculinity. The only examples I can think of are fairly old, but two came to mind. Credence Clearwater Revival has the song Someday Never Comes, which was the first one that came to mind to me, that deals with things like absent fathers. The point being that the justification for that absence, the idea that you will understand it when you are older, never really comes. Which I think raises questions of how we are pushed towards certain masculine ideals without questioning why those ideals are true or desirable.

Boston also had a song, ""To Be A Man"", which I think tries to frame being a man as not being mutually exclusive with being gentle and loving. I think that the song points out some pretty positive ideas of masculinity that generally are thought of as society as being un-masculine.

And there are many songs in similar veins, such as Cats in the Cradle. Maybe not so positive, but definitely has something to say about masculinity (though the message certainly can apply to any absent parent)."

I'll update with specific examples of lyrics in the morning but the entire album is basically depictions of different kinds of  men trying to get along in the world and keep up in an ever changing world.

The song bad for the boys is a petty roast of toxic masculinity.

The end is nigh is a song about a man dying of alcoholism

Probably some of my favorite lyrics in a song:


Gonna miss writing songs on piano


Gonna miss Shay and her giant cans


Gonna miss that pretty little Jew Rado


Gonna miss my daughter growing into a man




Also Try JPEGMAFIA, all my heroes are cornballs

There is a song on there called free the frail that is relevant to the sub. It's about the pressure of your image and deciding to do your best and letting the chips fall where they may rather than holding in that anxiety."

4443,2020-12-23 15:41:20,kikvuh,"If you want male artists who uplift men and their feelings in a way that doesn’t elevate or glorify the harmful patriarchy/traits that society has deemed men MUST have despite their harmful effects try BTS.
They talk a ton about mental health (which is even more taboo in Korea), they have talked about going to therapy, their album Map Of The Soul: 7 is actually based on the work of famed psychologist Carl Jung. All 7 of them have openly cried in public for all kinds of reasons: joy, frustration, gratitude, sadness, anger. And when they cry they support each other and comfort one another. 

They support one another and help them to pursue their ideas, hopes and dreams. They build each other up. They take time to teach others new skills. They demonstrate platonic physical affection toward one another (that is more common in Korea but it never hurts to see examples of men platonically cuddling), and respect each other’s boundaries. 

Their growth into who they are today is also an amazing example of how masculinity is different for everyone, and how there is no “right” way to be a man. Initially they were supposed to be an edgy hip hop group. If you watch their early videos it’s a lot. Jimin particularly was cast by the management company as being the tough guy of the group. As they got older and grew into themselves Jimin found that softer more feminine styles suited him more and made him more comfortable. He has talked (briefly) about redefining his own definition of masculinity as well as some struggles with alcohol and learning to talk to his friends about his feelings instead of drinking to cover them. In fact all of them have their own style and embrace expressions of the feminine to the degree that feels right to them! 

They have been outspoken about their support for the lgbtqia. LGBTQIA issues are more taboo in Korea than the US which makes the stance even more powerful. 

I could really go on and on about how they are a great example of masculinity. It was one of the things that got me into the group. Plus they are all smart and it comes though in their lyrics. 

If you have trouble getting into the boy band type pop music I highly recommend checking out their solo mix tapes. Right now only the rappers have full mixed tapes released: RM, J-hope, and Suga. I specifically recommend Suga’s mix tape D-2 which he released under the name Agust D. Look up an explanation of the lyrics for Deachwita. The other songs on it are very good too and deal with mental health, what it means to be a human, existence etc."

[Fight Test - The Flaming Lips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fye1XtXQn9s) is a little more nuanced, I think. To understand the song, the singer is looking back on a situation where another man moved on his woman, and the singer chose not to fight him, instead feeling like he should play it cool. He loses his woman, and is contemplating whether it really is right to fight or be the bigger man. I think it's a really valuable perspective to have - as men, there's a natural tension between not wanting to support a power structure versus protecting ourselves from being abused by said power structure.

Neither song is particularly empowering, sorry, but I do think they're discussing important issues dealing with men's liberation as a subject."

4474,2020-12-23 17:58:41,kikvuh,"I’ll throw a couple personal favorites into the pot:

Self Control by Frank Ocean (or really anything from this album): While this is definitely a sad song rather than something I put on to feel empowered, I think it’s a really great example of a type of emotional expression men are often barred from. He sings about a past relationship that he’s still stuck on, despite the other person having long moved on. This admission of being torn up over a problem that simply can’t be fixed is something I think is rarely allowed from men. This song (and album in general) were very important for me personally in realizing that I’ve been shamed for feeling similar things to Frank for most of my life.

The Man of Metropolis Steals Our Hearts by Sufjan Stevens: This album is FULL of great critiques of traditional masculinity, but I felt like this song best exemplifies the topic of this thread. Here, Sufjan deconstructs the “Superman” ideal and replaces it with a realistic model of masculinity: one who is imperfect and expresses emotion but is still dedicated to helping the world around him. The entire thing also has a double-meaning, functioning also as a song about being gay and in love with a man (“only a real man can be a lover”). 

As other people have said, IDLES, Dorian Electra, Charli XCX, etc. are all great as well."

4481,2020-12-23 16:10:06,kikvuh,"I think a lot about the Western self. A core human emotion can be “shame,” interior, traumatizing. Running away from imagined shame is a fundamental psychological impetus. The “virtue” of beauty is about the objectivity of your body in someone’s eyes being so “objective” that the perceived body is inscribed interior.  With beauty is the imagined strength of neuronal connections to be “put on the spot and pass with flying colors.” Inscribing that “beauty type with neuronal connections” as an interior, stable self is a type of “objectification.”

Beneath a quiet admiration for preppy boat shoes at Martha’s Vineyard, you are imagining allies who have or have not lived through your “what-it-takes-to-be-human shaming” and passed due to the beautiful interior self of strong neurons.

Without shame, without objectification, I think the only social scene would be a nightclub with a costume wardrobe, where we roleplay Red Tuxedos and Marilyn Monroe.

I’d like to share with you the Oasis song “Wonderwall.” Please listen to the lyrics, which are in fact “veiled in plain sight.” Those lyrics are just as veiled as Led Zeppelin’s “Stairway to Heaven.”

On the topic on MensLib, the only way Ye talks about dealing with this cognitive dissonance between his past actions and current feelings is anger and violence.

4517,2020-12-23 19:05:15,kikvuh,"I think the guest rapper's verse could be doing that. I don't read the rest of the song as doing that. Instead, I interpreted it as appreciating a man's penis without saying it has to be big."
4518,2020-12-23 19:24:03,kikvuh,"I love Salt n Pepa and know that song by heart, but their views are definitely nineties level of woke-ness. 

In their other hit What a Man they have a line that's funny in retrospect, ""I know most men are hoes but he goes on the down low so I never heard about him with another girl.""

Funny because today's language makes her man sound gay. But in reality she is starting from the assumption that he's cheating on her, but he's a good man, because at least he keeps it a secret. So essentially they're saying the most you can hope for from a man is a subtle betrayer. ಠ_ಠ

So much of the harm of patriarchy is in these ideas that one gender is inherently awful and lowering our expectations of decency."
4519,2020-12-23 20:31:35,kikvuh,"This verse is in the mind of the rapper. It's talking about what she, personally, finds attractive, not saying that every man needs to be this way to be hot. After all, society doesn't expect every man to have smooth, dark skin and a big butt in order to be attractive, does it?"

4522,2020-12-23 11:34:15,kikvuh,"I’ve become much more aware of the lack of compliments and affirmation most men receive over the past few years. When I first started dating my SO he said I was the first gf he had to tell him *he* was attractive and hot. Apparently his past gfs would say things like “oh that shirt looks good on you” not “you look good in that shirt”. I think the difference matters.

This thread has also reminded me of a compliment I paid a coworker. He just looked really sharp and put together that day so I told him. I will never forget the look on his face after I complimented him - like he had received an actual gift. I almost felt bad afterward, because I paid the compliment without thinking but it clearly meant a lot to him. And if an offhand compliment meant so much to him then it probably didn’t happen very often, which is just not right. 

Almost all of us want to be appreciated and/or desired, but in modern society men have really been neglected in this regard. As you said it’s not an excuse to push boundaries or anything like that. But I’m so glad this sub exists to draw attention to these issues because it’s important (ya’ll are important) and it should be talked about."

4526,2020-12-23 22:12:04,kikvuh,"It’s the willful ignorance on her part to discredit male body shaming (e.g. common things like shaming men for their dick sizes, which you see basically everywhere). Male bodyshaming almost never gets talked about, period. And for someone like Lizzo to make such an uplifting song about male body types while simultaneously spouting nonsense like this just hurts my head to think about."

4528,2020-12-23 16:59:17,kikvuh,"For the section you quoted, I don’t think he was trying to shit talk women who do Pilates or yoga. This is the annotation for that line on the song’s genius page:

>	Kanye refers to the over-sexualization of women, especially those inside the entertainment industry. He wishes that when his daughters grows up they’ll stay away from the hobbies men  sexualize.

I do agree that Kanye‘s way of handling the situation is problematic at places. I think it’s refreshing from a songwriting perspective that he’s honest and that he is not handling the situation in the best way.  it feels less preachy. I don’t think the song was explicitly endorsing the bad ideas either, but that’s just me. 

It also should be noted that Kanye himself did not write the song"

4530,2020-12-23 20:39:50,kikvuh,"Wow. Good catch. This jives with some of that redpill talk about how desirable women would rather attempt to share the top picks of men than settle for someone they view as less than what they deserves...unless of course single motherhood, debt, aging out, or some other factor forces the dire compromise to be made (e.g. hypergamy). Essentially that a man that can cheat on you but might possibly choose not to is preferable to man who is unlikely to be able to cheat on you because of their lack of any base of strength (social skills, wealth, looks, etc.)

I wonder what the modern equivalent of the lyrics would be? Maybe she rejects the guy because of the perceived promiscuity but then again her fundamental view that most guys cheat would be first point of difference. So...she'd be rapping about her flawed logic and trauma that caused it?"

4535,2020-12-23 18:30:16,kikvuh,"Not the person you asked, but , I think it's a combo of a few ingrained patriarchal ideas (n.b. I'm another woman lurker so can obviously only offer an outside perspective)

1. Men are not ""supposed"" to care about their looks – to do so is vain and either feminine or (shock horror) _gay_. Men are supposed to be praised for the things they do rather than than how they look.

2. Women are generally hesitant to compliment or even chat to men in case it's interpreted as flirting (which of course means that the only time they do is when they _are_ flirting). Being accused of ""leading him on"" can put women in a very dangerous situation, so it's often safest not to draw attention to yourself in that way.

3. Men are generally hesitant to compliment men in case it's interpreted as flirting or feminine. 

4. The unspoken tension between men as competitors, which means complimenting the other gives ground. It certainly feels like this was also a common dynamic in women's relationships (the Mean Girls stereotype) until relatively recently, but there's been a shift towards solidarity and supportive relationships between women – something that is sorely needed for men too."
4536,2020-12-23 18:13:58,kikvuh,"Short answer: gender roles. 

Long answer: I can go all the way back to when humanity shifted from mostly hunter-gatherers to farming with this one, but I’ll try to keep it more succinct than that. Also these are all generalizations and do not necessarily apply to any individual person or to all cultures. 

Basically “traditional” gender roles (which have been shifting thankfully), place men as the pursuers and women as the ones being pursued. Men are expected to be aggressive, women passive (sexually but also in most other aspects of life). 

Emotionally men are expected to be stoic to “take care of themselves”. Women are expected to be emotional - basically the opposite. Men are really only “allowed” to be angry, aggressive, or elated (but only in relation to “masculine” pursuits). Women are mostly “allowed” to have any emotions except anger/aggression (but of course having those emotions is “feminine” and therefore looked down on).  

So how does this relate to compliments? Well the traditional strong stoic man shouldn’t need compliments, especially when it comes to his appearance. And the traditional emotional fragile woman clearly needs them. The traditional woman is also passive - she’s pursued, she doesn’t pursue. Compliments may imply an “untoward” interest. Men give the compliments and women receive them. 

I realize it’s even more complicated than this but that’s my basic take. I could write an entire essay but I’ll just end with this - we’re all placed in a box by society based on the gender we’re assigned at birth. The expectations placed on men are just as limiting as the ones placed on women (IMO).
