0,2020-02-03 23:17:56,eyc8dc,I can handle Ken but Jenny got to go. I don't even know how she's still taken serious after her whole anti-vax thing.
1,2020-02-03 23:02:55,eyc8dc,"I believe the show is based on a Korean version that Ken's mother turned him onto, so he is the one who brought it to us, that would explain why he's been a judge here and in the UK.  He's making a fortune on this show."
2,2020-02-04 00:16:26,eyc8dc,"People take Ken way too seriously. Once you think of him as an annoying younger brother who makes out there guesses, you need to understand those guesses aren‚Äôt legit. It‚Äôs just to ease the flow of TV."
3,2020-02-03 23:44:21,eyc8dc,"Jenny is the panel's ""celebrity expert,"" a job she does well, considering she has the best track record in the show so far.  Yeah, she can be annoying sometimes, makes occasional stupid guesses, and has some idiotic beliefs, but as long as she doesn't use the show to spread her moronic antivax shit, I think she's fine. 

Ken is pretty bad though. Bad guesses, not funny, repeats the same schtick over and over... it's too bad he's basically the face of the show."
4,2020-02-04 01:23:29,eyc8dc,"Jenny has such broad knowledge of celebrities. She‚Äôs a good guesser. Ken is there to be silly. Both Jenny and Nicole remind me of drunks in a bar listening to the jukebox - WHO IS THIS? I KNOW THIS VOICE! Wish Jamie was a regular. He‚Äôs so funny, smart and encouraging."
5,2020-02-03 19:59:27,eyc8dc,"Ive wanted Ken gone since season 1 ep 1. He has the occasional 'ha ha' jokes, but a lot are just cringey and not needed. Theyve had many guest judges who would be great replacements for Ken"
6,2020-02-03 20:22:25,eyc8dc," HaHaa. Jenny is not comedy, nor color commentary. She‚Äôs a stupid anti-vaxer & she gotta go. Kens schtick gets old fast, surprisingly he kept it to minimum last nite. If he changes his sayings & guesses normally (wasn‚Äôt he the one who said Dolly Parton? FFS!) he can be funny at times, minus the puns. I guess that‚Äôs my two cents.  Enjoy the show, it‚Äôs tons of fun!!!"
7,2020-02-03 20:06:56,eyc8dc,Agreed. In my opinion the judges are the worst part of the show - especially the two you pointed out!
8,2020-02-03 20:02:38,eyc8dc,Ken is also unfunny on the UK version. Had Donny Osmond replace him one week and was so much better. Then this week Sharon and Kelly Osbourne replaced him. Unfortunately he is back this week!
9,2020-02-04 03:54:40,eyc8dc,"Ken is an acquired taste. He used to annoy me SO much but now I  just keep waiting for his ""I know EXACTLY who this is, and I'll tell you why""."
10,2020-02-03 22:00:35,eyc8dc,I agree 100% and was just saying this the other day

12,2020-02-04 03:24:12,eyc8dc,"Idea time!!

It would be cool if a final season of The Masked Singer is a rotation of previous contestants.  

Imagine all unmasked contestants (by end of 3rd season, 46) on a rotation every week until the finale, with all contestants from previous seasons and the unmasked in the current season in the audience, and the original 4 judges reprise their roles."
13,2020-02-04 07:21:31,eyc8dc,"PREACH!!!! Jenny should have never been on the show in the first place. Ken could go he plays too dumb and always guesses stupid ppl claiming ‚ÄúiM RiGhT‚Äù...his shtick is old...  jamie fox should be the 3rd permanent judge with robin and nicole, i rest my case!"
14,2020-02-05 07:59:48,eyc8dc,I hate Jenny for her uneducated anti-vax views.  I really hope she is fired.
15,2020-02-09 00:38:09,eyc8dc,"Unpopular opinion but if you‚Äôre gonna hate on Jenny for having anti-vaxx views, you should hate on Robin for anti-consent views too."
16,2020-02-04 00:44:54,eyc8dc,[deleted]
17,2020-02-04 04:23:16,eyc8dc,I know *exactly* what this joke is!
18,2020-02-04 19:58:11,eyc8dc,I got so tired of that. EVERY SINGLE TIME. EVERY SINGLE EPISODE.
19,2020-02-04 04:21:13,eyc8dc,I believe Jenny had a talk show.
20,2020-02-04 13:46:25,eyc8dc,"Every time Joel has been on, he's done the same ""Come on, just take off the mask"" shtick and just makes fun of the show. He'd be a better replacement for Ken as ""the funnyman who makes the same jokes over and over."""

I guess people like exist in all communities,but he shouldn't be the face of asian community. I simply stopped supporting Hollywood long time ago.

35,2020-02-02 11:12:26,exktng,"Lol--I find the pictures funny.

In my opinion it perfectly sums up metaphorically the general experiences of AM in the West."
36,2020-02-02 17:30:52,exktng,"Ken Jeong definitely set us back. However he has funded and supported projects that give platforms to positive Asian male representation these days(i.e. Simu). Idk if he planned this out to play to the white mans game until he had enough pull and financial resources to do his own thing, or he matured and realized what he did was damaging and changed course as he got older. Either way I can't say 100% that he's bad. He definitely sold out and fucked us over to get his money, but I'm allowing him the opportunity to grow into a more positive influence for Asian males."
37,2020-02-02 15:46:46,exktng,"I *really* want to believe that they photoshopped him into the picture.

But would he have the career he has in Hollywood now If he did not portray the typical Asian male stereotype? No. I'm sure deep down inside he knows this and that he knows he sold some of his dignity for fame. I think we are too quick to blame Ken jeong when we should be blaming Hollywood for perpetuating this stereotype. Based on what others have said, Ken is helping other asian actors. He's supporting us, in his own way. Let's not waste too much time hating on Ken Jeong and instead focus on promoting and uplifting those that can be our children's role models."
56,2020-01-30 01:08:56,ev2a65,"Yeah OP doesn't know wtf he's talking about.  Quoting Simu, then going on a rant about Ken Jeong when Simu has credited Ken for helping get his career going."

Very harsh? I think I have been very balanced in my comment. Please tell me your thoughts about this photoshoot. It kinda sums up his career. Yes I do give him credit for supporting Asian media but until he stops doing shit like this, people should continue to call him out. 

What you are also saying is the end justifies the means. Ignoring him would be telling your children it is ok to shit on your own culture and sell your dignity if that means it benefits you personally. I prefer my children to have higher standards."
59,2020-01-29 23:00:04,ev2a65,Yeah it‚Äôs wild. Ken also funded and produced a documentary about an AM college football player.

Asian saboteurs on the other hand are narcissists who don't have quite enough genuine talent to receive the praise they think they are entitled to.

I would much rather deal with minstrels than saboteurs."

* What we hear at home on TV is likely not live singing but instead a recording as the mics are often not adjusting volume wise when they are moved away from where the mouth presumably is.
* They have 12 or 16 contestants but instead of everyone but the King revealed every other week, only 1 or 2 people revealed each week until everyone is unmasked (including King) by the season finale.
* No skills or other interesting things from contestants; only verbal clues are provided.

118,2020-01-18 12:42:04,eqcwsd,"Tom and Jerry is extremely popular. 

Lets see the first trailer and then we can guage how much this movie has the potential to make!"
119,2020-01-18 06:29:22,eqcwsd,Honestly no idea how big Tom and Jerry is as a franchise worldwide
120,2020-01-18 07:27:21,eqcwsd,"This would also be a reboot film since the first and only theatrical movie for Tom and Jerry was released in 1992, Tom & Jerry: The Movie."
121,2020-01-18 11:25:19,eqcwsd,"If it's good, OS will be high. Anything between 200-500mill is possible and if the trailer gets Joker level buzz like, views& likes maybe a slight possibility of 1bill since it's December"
122,2020-01-18 06:25:57,eqcwsd,"I‚Äôll wait until the first trailer comes out before judging.

But, if it‚Äôs quality-level like Princess and the Frog or Bumbleebee, I‚Äôll put my range from $250-$500M WW"
123,2020-01-18 13:31:39,eqcwsd,"Given it's surprising lack of competition, it actually has a chance of doing well. The only other family movie scheduled for release in that same month is Croods 2. And there don't seem to be any PG-13 blockbusters either, so don't be terribly surprised if this thing ends up in the $400 million worldwide."
124,2020-01-18 09:32:30,eqcwsd,"I think it will be moved from this current release date, but to predict how much it'll make, i think the overseas ratio to domestic numbers will be huge, because Tom and Jerry are a well known IP worldwide."
125,2020-01-18 11:10:21,eqcwsd,I'll wait for a trailer.
126,2020-01-18 14:29:07,eqcwsd,"I hope its not live action... if it is then its going to be another ""Cats"" but worse"
127,2020-01-18 12:01:21,eqcwsd,"I think it runs the risk of getting slaughtered by ""Dune"" (which isn't exactly an unpopular franchise)"
128,2020-01-18 16:00:57,eqcwsd,"My predictions are that it gets delayed till Valentine's Day when they find out Raya is awesome and then it does the same numbers as Lego Movie 2 more or less.  Probably a little weaker overseas since I feel like they're probably not airing Tom and Jerry reruns in China.  I'll say 175m WW, 100m DOM"
129,2020-01-18 07:05:49,eqcwsd,EXTREMELY POPULAR in India.
130,2020-01-18 08:22:52,eqcwsd,tom and jerry are worldwide icons mate
131,2020-01-18 11:06:47,eqcwsd,Pretty big in the Nordic countries. The short films aired on TV all the time.
132,2020-01-18 23:13:51,eqcwsd,"They‚Äôre the kind of characters that everyone knows about but most people don‚Äôt actually watch that much of. If it‚Äôs a good movie, that combined with their fame should lead to it being quite successful."
133,2020-01-18 13:55:35,eqcwsd,The original cartoons are very popular but the movies and so on not so much
134,2020-01-18 07:20:39,eqcwsd,It was big when i was child.
135,2020-01-18 08:27:41,eqcwsd,I actually remember owning the DVD of that as a kid. I was shocked that they talked in it.
136,2020-01-18 15:48:51,eqcwsd,"PG-13? Oh, that would be Disney's medieval rape movie, The Last Duel, starring Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, and Adam Driver directed by Ridley Scott. Also opens Dec 2020.

On a more serious note, why do you think Croods isn't that much of a competition? The first one did almost $600M worldwide."
137,2020-01-18 19:33:56,eqcwsd,"It's live action but not like Cats, it's like Alvin and the Chinkchumps with a lead that has to look like Jennifer Lawrence"
138,2020-01-18 09:56:50,eqcwsd,[deleted]
139,2020-01-18 08:25:11,eqcwsd,"In that case I could see it do well, as long as the characters don‚Äôt look atrocious, there‚Äôs a lot riding on the VFX."
140,2020-01-18 14:19:16,eqcwsd,well the last one got memed to death so there is that
141,2020-01-18 08:29:48,eqcwsd,"One of Henry Mancini's last scores, for reasons even he might not have been able to explain....."
142,2020-01-18 08:43:44,eqcwsd,"But this would also be technically Warner Bros.'s first theatrical Tom and Jerry film since the 1992 film was a Turner (pre-Time Warner ownership) production and the other 13 films were just direct-to-video.

It's interesting it's taken almost 3 decades for Tom and Jerry to get another theatrical movie just for themselves."
143,2020-01-18 15:54:27,eqcwsd,"If it were any time of year, then yes, I would say competing against Croods would be a mistake. But this is the holiday season, a season where there's plenty of room for 2 family movies to do well."
144,2020-01-18 10:14:46,eqcwsd,"I never made the claim that T&J would be an international blockbuster based on it‚Äôs popularity in the Indian subcontinent. I merely offered an insight into the original comment.

Secondly, you should wait to see how well Scoob! does. If that film does well, T&J on a Christmas holiday, definitely has immense chances."
145,2020-01-18 11:09:00,eqcwsd,Yeah I agree. Much like with Scoob the animation needs to look good.
146,2020-01-18 16:11:40,eqcwsd,There's also Dune and West Side Story. I could also see them as movies that could be watched by families.
147,2020-01-18 10:32:41,eqcwsd,Scooby doo is a far more relevant ip today so i'm really not sure that says much for Tom and Jerry
148,2020-01-18 16:39:34,eqcwsd,"Maybe West Side Story, but I highly doubt something like Dune would appeal much to the family crowd."
149,2020-01-18 11:07:41,eqcwsd,"Yeah Sbooby is bigger, that doesnt mean Tom and Jerry arent very big."

163,2020-01-14 19:59:20,eopoa7,"biggest news I've heard so far!!!

164,2020-01-14 19:12:03,eopoa7,That event is going to be very hard to get tickets to.

187,2020-01-14 22:13:50,eopoa7,"Normally, I couldnt care less about celebrity endorsement, but Chappelle has proven himself to be of strong mind and moral through the years, and is a respected thinker above anything else."

191,2020-01-14 22:18:45,eopoa7,This is pretty awesome. Chappelle just won the Mark Twain award so he is already trending as we speak. That will do great for getting this into the cycle.
192,2020-01-14 20:34:27,eopoa7,Curious to see what effect this will have. The whole identity politics safespace section of the left absolutely hate him because of his recent special and some of the jokes he made.
193,2020-01-14 22:17:38,eopoa7,Great news. This might open the flood gates for new endorsements. Everyone likes Chappelle.

266,2020-01-15 04:38:44,eopoa7,"I live in Utah which is usually heavily republican leaning, but if the polling showed he had a chance I would definitely consider a vote for sanders. My normal M.O. is to vote 3rd party. Trump is s non-starter for me."
267,2020-01-15 03:21:12,eopoa7,"I‚Äôm not usually one to wax poetical about all his points and there are probably other Yang Gangers better but basically I would say most of us believe that Yang has better policies for addressing pretty much all of the things Bernie has problems. On a very basic level he looks at the problems in our country and tries to find solutions to the root causes not just the superficial results of those problems, and does it in a way that generally alters incentives so people /companies act good for their own benefit, not just praying they will be benevolent because it‚Äôs the right thing to do, which I think we can agree is not what happens in capitalism that gave us child labor until we explicitly stopped it. Few examples: 

One of my favorite policies is democracy dollars which gives $100 to each adult to donate to a political campaign to counter balance the financial power of big money interests to bribe congress and politicians through lobbying so politicians will actually start working the people again instead being bought by big business, since he acknowledges that esp with a conerservative leaning Supreme Court, overturning Citizen‚Äôs United is very unlikely.

Yang‚Äôs proposed VAT as a method of paying for his proposal is highly successful in many countries across the world where as wealth taxes have been tried in a handful which mostly failed and repealed in almost all of them, so the plan to pay for bernie‚Äôs Medicare for all plan is highly suspect. 

UBI helps everyone get out of poverty, regardless of your ability to work in economically approved positions rather than an increased minimum wage which only helps people working minimum wage jobs and probably decreases the number of minimum wage jobs out there by increasing costs of workers especially for small businesses. UBI serves as a $12,000 disincentive to all crime, so you have to make more than 12k in criminal activity even be worth it or else you‚Äôre screwing yourself out of your UBI for no reason. It also gives all workers and union members more support and bargaining power. Or alternatively gives people in abusive relationships more financial freedom to get out of those relationships. It also supports stay at home care givers and community volunteers. None of those things happen with bernie‚Äôs plans. 

His plan to refocus our economic assessments to include national markers for health, happiness, mental health and environmental quality (among other things), instead of just GDP and job growth to actually incentivize growth and development of our economy with positive pressures in things we actually want to improve. Where Bernie (and Warren) basically demonize billionaires, Yang admits that it‚Äôs hard to blame billionaires for successfully making money by using the broken system that politicians have left in place up til now, but it is our responsibility to try to fix the system to not reward pure greed and profits as the only goal.

He takes China‚Äôs threat to US dominance in technology, automation and 5G with their massive multi billion dollar government sponsored investments seriously and as a very big deal which requires significant investment for the Us gov to counter, unlike anything I‚Äôve heard from any other camps. 

His focus on actually trying to inspire everyone to be more civil and treat people humanely which he actually follows by treating republicans and trump supporters with respect and open discussion instead of just saying as a political tag line.

There‚Äôs tons of other points but those are ones off the top of my head. 

On some other issues there are probably decent amounts of overlap, like I think most of the Dems agree that climate change, gun control and some other things needs a lot of work. 

I would imagine a decent number of Yang gang would support Bernie if he was the nominee, but yang also has a diverse base of support with a lot coming from independent and republican supporters that aren‚Äôt inherently supporting the democratic candidate and not as opposed to Trump as many democrats are. Also there are probably at least a few dem Yang gang that are pissed enough now at how the DNC is treating Yang that they might pull a BernieBro2016 in the first place and not support the dem nominee as protest even if not going so far as to vote for trump. I mean Berniebros did it last time and helped give us trump in the first place so shouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it might happen this time too."
268,2020-01-15 15:38:33,eopoa7,"Sanders is simply an ineffective Yang. If you take the time and look at his solutions, you'll find out that they will either NOT work or they won't pass. He's great at identifying problems, but so was Trump."
269,2020-01-15 02:33:16,eopoa7,Probably not. Never been a fan of Sanders at all.
270,2020-01-14 20:21:04,eopoa7,"Because our campaign is already have a lot on their hands to deal with. Plus, the whole sending out tickets, campaign rules, collecting payments, and stuff."

From the whistleblower of CA, Brittany Kaiser. She [is in the news again recently, releasing more of her hard drive emails and audio recordings](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/04/cambridge-analytica-data-leak-global-election-manipulation) 

This was from her tapes she recorded of Alexander Nix giving a pitch to potential clients about how he got Afro-Carribs to not vote:

‚ÄúOne was that all the youth, Indian and Afro-Caribbean, felt disenfranchised ‚Ä¶ And secondly, amongst the Indians the familial hierarchies were really strong. There was huge respect for their elders and their parents and their families, but not so for the Afro-Caribbeans. And that was enough information to inform the entire campaign.

‚ÄúWe went to the client and said, we only want to do one thing, we want to run a campaign where we target the youth ‚Äì all youth, all the Blacks and all the Indians ‚Äì and we try and increase apathy. And they didn't really understand why‚Ä¶ but they allowed us to do this campaign, and the campaign had to be non-political, because no one, the kids don‚Äôt care about politics. It had to be reactive, because they‚Äôre lazy; inclusive of all ethnicities; bottom-up. It had to be exciting, because kids want to do something fun.

‚ÄúWe came up with this campaign which was all about ‚ÄòBe part of the gang, do something cool, be part of a movement.‚Äô And it was called the ‚ÄòDo So‚Äô campaign‚Ä¶ A3 posters. And graffiti, yellow paint, you know, we cut stencils with the jigsaw‚Ä¶ And we'd give these to kids, and they'd get in their cars at night, you know, just make a drawing, get in the car, and race around the country putting up these posters and getting chased by the police and all their friends were doing it, and it was fucking brilliant fun‚Ä¶

‚ÄúDo So. Don't vote. Don't be involved in politics. It's like a sign of resistance against ‚Äì not government, against politics. And voting. And very soon they're making their own YouTube videos. This is the prime minister‚Äôs house that's being graffitied! ‚Ä¶ It was carnage.

‚ÄúAnd the reason why this was such a good strategy is because we knew, and we really really knew, that when it came to voting, all the Afro-Caribbean kids wouldn't vote, because they ‚ÄòDo So‚Äô. But all the Indian kids would do what their parents told them to do, which is go out and vote. And so all the Indians went out and voted, and the difference on the 18-35-year-old turnout is like 40%, and that swung the election by about 6% ‚Äì which is all we needed!‚Äù"

But then again, WB rushed the DC films so I'm not really surprised at this. I'm warming up to the idea and excited to see this, though my hopes aren't high, but still I wish it was straight up Scooby and the gang and just that."

354,2020-03-25 17:24:30,fotxjg,Blue Falcon and Dynomutt?!?! What?
355,2020-03-25 18:51:24,fotxjg,"It's nice that OP took the time to list all the movie's voice actors... except for, you know, the title character. Let's give Frank Welker, the guy who's been with Scooby-Doo since day 1, his due.

Or... his Doo.

I'll see myself out."

357,2020-03-25 20:18:52,fotxjg,Even though Matthew Lilard isnt doing the voice of Shaggy im still excited!
358,2020-03-25 20:42:17,fotxjg,"I read the title as ""iScooby"". Like iCarly, but starring a dog who eats sandwiches that are three feet tall.

My one criticism, based just on the poster, is the slight case of Chronic Sameface. This is when an artist, despite all his efforts, can only really draw one kind of face, and all the characters end up looking the same. Velma is recognizable only because of her red hair. Take that away and she might as well be an entirely new a different character."
359,2020-03-25 23:17:06,fotxjg,No Matthew Lillard as Shaggy? Already disappointed.....

366,2020-03-25 22:16:32,fotxjg,"I really dislike most of what's involved. 

It's like when I used to see voice actors getting others into their projects and it was usually *who can I get that is popular?* or *I'll just ask my friend!* instead of basing on pure talent. That and nepotism/connections. Like most of Hollywood honestly. 

I can stomach the character designs *(albeit a bit cabbage patch, like Elementium mentioned)* but Fred doesn't even look like Fred, IMO. :(

Not only do they shoe-horn Blue Falcon in *(just give him his own film or at least don't sideline the main characters..)* it just seems like they don't give af about the Scooby gang so much. I understand mixing things up a bit for creative purposes and what not but damn, taking out Grey Griffin *AND* Matthew Lillard? Replacing them with Amanda Seyfried and Will Forte...REALLY? 

The writing probably won't be really good either just from looking at the writer's credits. I've been surprised before but doubt it this time.
 
Junkie XL will be doing the music and while he's got some good titles under him, I can't help but think he's kind of a bastard. I'd rather someone more deserving have the chance at composing but oh well, not my production.

I *want* to be hopeful since I've been a fan of the Scooby series since I was a kid so I'll still watch and try to enjoy it regardless."
367,2020-03-25 20:47:47,fotxjg,I read this as iScoob and thought it would be some tech themed mystery.

Is that Blue Falcon and Dynomutt I see?"
369,2020-03-25 21:42:46,fotxjg,Did it really need that many celebrities? I mean - c'mon.
370,2020-03-25 23:37:59,fotxjg,I'm still not cool with them replacing most of the cast.
371,2020-03-26 00:52:05,fotxjg,Nope. Don't like that.
372,2020-03-26 13:26:19,fotxjg,"Not super looking forward to this. As soon as the synopsis was announced I lost interest. Scooby-Doo is an awesome franchise with a lot of fun material and history. Turning the monster mystery into a superhero crossover world-saving adventure with Scooby Doo characters just sounds lame and off the mark. There‚Äôs not a shortage of Scooby-Doo content to watch, What‚Äôs New and Mystery Inc. are on Netflix now, so not every piece of it has to be my taste. But it‚Äôs not shaping up to be much good."
373,2020-03-26 01:48:24,fotxjg,im still super upset that they didnt cast any of the original actor like Mathew lillard or frank jones

I just hope they don't go campy with it, like they often do with those 60's era reboots. Hell, I'd settle for a Netflix series. It wasn't necessarily a kid's centric property, so I think it would do well with a mature audience."
427,2020-03-26 01:28:26,fotxjg,"I also half-wonder if *The Venture Bros* has served to make such an adaptation less likely, in the sense of the parody of programs of that nature being more prominent for a while now than any version of it played on the level."

476,2020-03-25 20:35:29,fotxjg,"I did mean as the voice of Scooby in this movie Welker should have been listed in OP's title.  And it's why I used the word 'with' when describing his association with the franchise.

But I can see where the confusion could come in. Having someone be a voice in a franchise named after a character, then going on to voice said character, can be confusing when I don't make clear I'm separating the character from the franchise.  My fault for not being more clear."
477,2020-03-26 03:02:42,fotxjg,"Because they earned their spot and replacing professional voice actors with recognizable name stars is a slap in the face.  People aren't going to see the movie for Zac Efron, Amanda Seyfried, and Will Forte, they'll see it because it's a Scooby Doo movie, so there's no reason to NOT use the people who have been voice acting their characters for over a decade."
478,2020-03-26 20:06:33,fotxjg,I think he just said it felt like a blue falcon movie with scooby hamfisted in.

Come on, really?

\- Asian men in the west are dealing with an upsurge of racism and racist attacks (such as the recycling incident in San Francisco).

\- Asian men are still seen as lower life-forms in the West.

\- Asian men are still seen as weak, defenseless doormats. This is further exacerbated by the huge amounts of Asian men who look like nerds who've never touched a dumbbell in their life.

\- Asian men have to content with their women dating/marrying out in insane numbers. Either Asian men have to settle with fobby Asian women or date women of other races, lest Asian men risk dying alone.

\- Asian men have to contend with the bamboo ceiling, which basically ensures that Asian men will never be promoted to actual leadership positions in a company being ""tech supervisor"" or whatever. 

\- Asian men face discrimination in dating, even by their own Asian women who almost always have white fever and will justify whatever reasons (such as ""eww, he reminds me of my brother) to not date an Asian dude.

\- The Asian man's presence in the west in sports, media, and politics is still sorely lacking. Meanwhile, white men and black men enjoy the ""trickle down"" effects of having such an enormous monopoly in these sectors. Besides, what white dude or black dude is intimidated by some effeminate K-Pop dude who can sing and dance?

>AM were not harassing or assaulting non-Asians in US, EU, or UK.

Who cares? Are we getting a pat on the back from the media for fulfilling the ""nice"" Asian stereotype? Nope. Asians are still seen as perpetual foreigners. And it seems the only Asian countries that America is friendly towards is either a country that has a U.S. military presence (such as South Korea and Japan) or welcomes sexpats like a red carpet (Thailand and and Philippines)."

[I had to look it up LOL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psFu3eRXvFc)"
590,2020-03-08 12:16:12,ffa4xl,"Just so you know, Ken was a guest (so was Ryan Reynolds) on the South Korean version, not an actual contestant. Portugal did similar recently where they got a variety of famous people to wear the same chameleon costume every week and get unmasked almost immediately.

---------------------

But anyway, good news: [one of the EPs of the US version has been planning such a show for some time](https://inews.co.uk/culture/television/the-masked-singer-eurovision-battle-europe-worldwide-1361893). This article is from January but he's been talking about doing it since September.

Here are some of the singers I want to see on that:

UK: Queen Bee (Nicola Roberts), Daisy (Kelis), Unicorn (Jake Shears), Octopus (Katherine Jenkins), Butterfly (Patsy Palmer), Duck (Skin), Hedgehog (Jason Manford)

Aus: Robot (Cody Simpson), Lion (Kate Ceberano), Unicorn (Deni Hines), Monster (Gorgi Coghlan), Spider (Paulini) - honestly anyone but Rhino (Wendell Sailor)

Germany: Angel (Bulent Ceylan), Astronaut (Max Mutzke), they'll bring back Monster (Susi I forgot her last name was it Kellerman?), maybe Squirrel (Marcus Schenkenberg) to get all the soccer moms swooning because those CK ads have been at the back of their mind for years

France: Cupcake (Natasha St-Pier), Panda (Julie Zenatti), Monster (Smain)

Italy: Poodle (Arisa) or I will directly complain to Fox

Russia: Spider (strongly rumoured to be Lena Katina, the non-homophobic one from TaTU), Cloud (not 100% on her identity but people are guessing the freshly out-of-retirement Natalya Vetlitskaya)

Bulgaria: Rose (Zhana Bergendorff)

Mexico: Rabbit (Natalia Sosa)

Netherlands: Robot (Tania Kross), Mantis (Nienke Pias)

Peru: Sea Diva (no idea)

No-one from Hungary and Portugal that I'm that enthusiastic about. Finland is too early to tell."
591,2020-03-08 11:07:45,ffa4xl,"I'd love to see the astronaut from the German version compete again. I just desperately want to see him do something other than a sad, sappy, slow as molasses song. I want to see him do something with some energy and excitement on this show. He has an amazing voice, but because he did the same kind of song every single time, and it's my least favorite kind of songs, he ended up being one of my least favorite contestants in spite of that.

Also, I love that I'm not alone in my hate for Jenny McCarthy."
592,2020-03-08 14:12:05,ffa4xl,u watch all of these shows???
593,2020-03-10 01:32:51,ffa4xl,Holy crap. I wasn't expecting him to actually be able to sing.

696,2020-03-02 03:46:37,fc4whj,"Yeah, I strongly think that this exposure of Asian culture will better our position.

And also, I know right? I was surprised when I found out that Seattle did not have that many Asians, as I have had lots of good results on dating apps like Tinder and Bumble. Most of my matches are white, and a good number of them initiate the conversation."
697,2020-03-02 03:46:22,fc4whj,"Let me present a scenario. 

Take an asian-american teenager with potential in the music industry. Bring him back to his motherland where he doesn't speak his native tongue. Put him in a training program where he has no time for his family and friends. He doesn't get paid whatsoever even though the company promised him that he'll be rich. That's what Jay park went through. That's what many k-artists go through in the music industry. Granted, it's better now but it's not the best. Many just shut up and go through so they can make money to help their family. 

He needed an outlet to rant and vent. MySpace was his only space. Look, Jay park is not perfect. There are things that i disagree with him. But running two independent music labels in Korea is no joke. You have to give him mad props for that."
698,2020-03-02 02:21:21,fc4whj,"You're right, a lot of people do criticize him for his personality and such. But despite that, his literal presence in the music industry is helping us immensely. Most people don't research artists and see what they think about their home country, they just see his face and hear his music. While we don't have to praise him, we should acknowledge that his work is getting us popular recognition."
699,2020-03-03 00:23:34,fc4whj,"Dude no. That‚Äôs not how clout chasing works and we here are all for solidarity through Asian pride, not blind Nationalism against empathy for an individual expressing their opinion. Feeling helpless due to not fitting in, his family‚Äôs financial situation worsening during his unpaid training for three years, people around him unable to relate to his experience even in his own ethnic home country etc. are some of the few issues this sub of all places should be most familiar and able to empathise with. The man had to go back to America just a year into his debut and then came back to create his own label since most other saw him as too risky, put in more work while gathering fans on his journey upto this point and that‚Äôs the support of fans he enjoys today. You can‚Äôt slap the ‚Äúclout chaser‚Äù label because he wasn‚Äôt famous before the rant and popularity didn‚Äôt change much afterwards too i.e remained stagnant. 

For the twitter thing, funny how he is the one who was the first to bring  public attention to the tweet and it‚Äôs clear to anyone with a basic comprehension that he expresses disappointment in his tweet. Then at the moment he refuses to stoop to twitter level pettiness the world lashes out at him, for calling lil pump as ignorant dumbass and not intentionally racist ? Read the Yao Ming line and ask yourself, do you honestly think anyone who came up with a retarded line like that is even functioning on a normal level with all the lean in him ? Calling him racist in that situation is just giving more ‚ÄúAsians are too sensitive‚Äù ammunition to the actual racists when they commit a heinous racist crime. But nah, lets go mob hunting on twitter. 

Tbh I‚Äôd rather have Asian artists venting their frustration instead of opting suicide because the public couldn‚Äôt be bothered enough to see them as human behind their career acts. At least they‚Äôll contribute more in spreading Asian influences through their work compared to their critics. Is T.O.P from BigBang suppose to be a clout chasing Chan now ? Because he did something out of the normal for him, got drunk on IG live, talked about his depression and how he doesn‚Äôt want to come back to Korea because his own people treated him like shit. One of the guys who put their country on the map of entertainment, tries to O.D himself and their reaction is to shit more on him. GJ people. Maybe learn a few lesson from the number of high profile suicides last years and accept that artists feels frustration too because they are human."
700,2020-03-02 03:39:04,fc4whj,"The main reason I included the segment on IQ was to emphasize our psychological similarities regardless of ethnicity and background. This, in turn, highlights the impact of environmental influences on racist sentiments.

In my opinion, the reported IQ averages of countries are flawed. There is no way that the average IQ of Equatorial Guinea is 59. That is beyond the retarded category, and people would not survive a day with that intelligence. The reason behind these varied scores, again in my humble opinion, is that people in culturally distinct and impoverished countries were given an unfamiliar test by unfamiliar people, asked to solve unfamiliar problems that they never needed to solve and were given unclear instructions with language/dialect barriers. In countries like South Korea, however, parents emphasize education and students are taught to think in a different way early in life, explaining their higher scores. There is a clear correlation between IQ and the wealth of the respective country, which is due to the wealthy countries giving more resources for children's' education."
701,2020-03-02 03:43:56,fc4whj,"While my post is focused on dating/attraction, I think a large part of it still applies to the issues you mention. 

With more desirability and AMXF couples comes a higher position on the social totem pole, which leads to more respect and better treatment from others, leading to more job opportunities and less racism.

In things like the job market, Asians are often considered to lack social skills and thus don't get promoted to management positions as easily as other races. In things like public harassment and robberies, Asians are considered to be docile and uncombative, leading to the ""modern and historical cases of violence"" that you speak of. A better portrayal of our kind through representation and activism and help get rid of these stereotypes and fix a lot of our issues, not just dating/attraction."
702,2020-03-02 03:51:28,fc4whj,Thanks for your perspective. That's a good point.
703,2020-03-02 04:40:42,fc4whj,[deleted]
704,2020-03-02 04:56:13,fc4whj,"Well, I never said wealth leads to high IQ; I said there is a clear correlation. This is besides the point of this post, but whatever.

If you look at the list, the countries at the top (Singapore, China, Switzerland, Hong Kong) \*tend\* to have established educational systems and are not impoverished, and those at the bottom (Liberia, Cameroon, Ethiopia) are mainly from Africa and are almost all impoverished. Of course, there are exceptions to the rule, but there is an obvious correlation between the wealth of countries and a ""higher average IQ."" In the case of Eastern Europe and Mongolia (101), they are just average, and some of them have below 100 IQ, unlike the top 3 with 108, 108, and 106, respectively."

722,2020-02-16 05:34:18,f4l7qs,"I like Ken. He makes it fun even though it is stupid. I cant stand Jenny, she is the annoying one for me. I have learned to follow Robin's guesses, he is 90% correct."
723,2020-02-16 04:51:27,f4l7qs,Tbh I disagree but I can see how he‚Äôd be annoying for people.
724,2020-02-16 06:24:56,f4l7qs,I think Ken has a role from producers and he's getting his check.
725,2020-02-16 05:17:39,f4l7qs,"He's pretty funny. Not ""I'm laughing my ass off every single second of every single episode"" funny, but not necessarily unfunny either. He's not annoying to me. All the judges add their own flair to the show in different ways and all of them compliment each other/ balance each other out. I personally wouldn't change the panel in any way. It would mess up the chemistry of the show."
726,2020-02-16 06:19:29,f4l7qs,I don‚Äôt mind ken. Jenny is the worst!
727,2020-02-16 10:04:36,f4l7qs,"Not at all. Ken's hilarious! I do miss the whole ""I know exactly who this is"" schtick though."
728,2020-02-16 04:21:36,f4l7qs,"Strongly agree. In Season 1 he actually made an attempt at guessing, but the past two seasons it‚Äôs just been annoyingly hard to watch"
729,2020-02-16 11:58:25,f4l7qs,"He is clearly playing a role. Kind of insane, such as the character he had in Community.

I'm really glad he is there, the one I hate is Jenny (I'm kind of sad she gets screen-time even though her clearly dangerous views)"
730,2020-02-16 13:21:10,f4l7qs,"I can see your point here too, but I like him. I think he's so over the top though so that he can make silly guesses because if each one of the judges guessed really seriously then the show wouldn't be as fun. Part of his job is to get people to second guess themselves because some singers are easier to guess than others."
731,2020-02-16 05:02:49,f4l7qs,"He's a smart man. He knows his guesses are fake/stupid. So it infuriates me that he willingly just wastes time, not even taking his job as a guesser seriously. For whatever reason though I like him more this season than I did last. Ken and Robin should still be replaced by Joel McCale and Jamie Fox though"
732,2020-02-16 05:05:52,f4l7qs,"I‚Äôm in it for Ken, Nicole and the guest judges."

739,2020-02-16 08:25:10,f4l7qs,Most of the show irritates me. I just skip all the talking and watch the clues and tunes.
740,2020-02-16 14:05:02,f4l7qs,I prefer him over that vapid Jenny.  And Nicole falling for all the tall guys is dumb too.  Scrap them all except Robin.  He hadn't irritated me yet.
741,2020-02-16 15:23:46,f4l7qs,Do you think Ken‚Äôs job may be to throw the guesses off?
742,2020-02-16 20:32:50,f4l7qs,he bothers me so much. not a single episode goes by without him being arrogant and desperate and annoying.
743,2020-02-16 20:42:00,f4l7qs,Sell ken to the highest bidder....
744,2020-02-17 04:28:54,f4l7qs,He‚Äôs not my favorite but Jenny is by far the worst. seriously hope she gets replaced at some point.
745,2020-02-17 13:22:21,f4l7qs,"I like Ken but I do hate when he says ‚Äú<stupid irrelevant clues> means I know who it is so...welcome to The Masked Singer <insert absolutely ridiculous guess here>‚Äù

Every God damned time!"
746,2020-02-16 07:45:10,f4l7qs,"I love Ken. He‚Äôs providing the ‚Äúcomedy‚Äù.
I despise Jenny and wish they‚Äôd just replace her already. Everything about her is super annoying."
747,2020-02-16 14:53:14,f4l7qs,It has devolved from humor into a schtick.  I'm over him now.

749,2020-02-16 05:02:18,f4l7qs,Yes yes 100% yes I tape it and fast forward through most of the judges inane banter. The same joke over and over is just not funny but annoying
750,2020-02-16 04:52:39,f4l7qs,He‚Äôs so ungodly annoying
751,2020-02-16 12:33:19,f4l7qs,He‚Äôs a one note caricature. Tries waaaaay to hard
752,2020-02-16 17:26:45,f4l7qs," Jenny is annoying and guesses the same people over and over. Nicole is one of the worst overall at guessing and most times shes right she just bandwagons Robin's pick. Ken I like him he can be a bit over the top but his job is comic relief. Robin is the best guesser and actually listens to the performance and clue package not talk over them like the others.

I'd replace Jenny with Sarah Silverman, at least shes funny and knows more about music/singing. I'd replace Nicole with Reba shes loved by many, actually a good singer and probably be the best at recognizing  most voices of celebrities who were famous before the 2000s."
753,2020-02-16 15:04:32,f4l7qs,I hate all 4 judges.
754,2020-02-16 17:08:00,f4l7qs,He is by far the worst. He's just not a funny man.
755,2020-02-16 17:12:15,f4l7qs,"I find all the hosts the absolute worst part of the show. I hate all of them, I hate their ‚Äújokes‚Äù, their stupid guesses where they only ever make actual decent guesses when you know the persons going out."
756,2020-02-16 21:18:42,f4l7qs,"Nicole is the annoying one for me ,she was a pussycat doll 
Is she really talent judge material? There wasn't anyone with more credibility  available?"
757,2020-02-17 02:46:12,f4l7qs,Ken got Victor oladipo
758,2020-02-17 20:35:57,f4l7qs,Jenny is my annoyance. Ken is funny but seems to tell the same awkward dad jokes each episode
759,2020-02-18 18:29:57,f4l7qs,"This is a fun show and he is a fun judge. I like Ken, he's not supposed to be taken too seriously. Nicole and Robin are my favorites"
760,2020-02-16 06:38:09,f4l7qs,"At this point, everyone except Robin irritates me.

I would kill for new judges who take it seriously and don't talk over the performers."
761,2020-02-16 07:51:06,f4l7qs,I feel like he was the kid in school that was really obnoxious and tried too hard to be funny so people would fake laugh to get him to stop talking but he took that as him being actually really funny
762,2020-02-16 10:50:33,f4l7qs,"Yes, he irritates me. I always skip his judgement when I‚Äôm watching through Hulu lol"
763,2020-02-16 11:22:04,f4l7qs,"I know he is supposed to be the comic relief / butt monkey of the judges, but I feel like sometimes he got a little too hammy for comfort."
764,2020-02-16 13:29:36,f4l7qs,"I like him in most things...movies, tv, etc. I liked him in the beginning of this...but now his attempts at humor are weak, lame, and repetitive. His formula is be loud. Make ridiculously wrong guesses. Be loud."
765,2020-02-16 14:09:37,f4l7qs,I hate him he's annoying af
766,2020-02-16 07:18:51,f4l7qs,He won‚Äôt be as Annoying once you see him on the British version of masked singer... he‚Äôs horrendous there

768,2020-02-16 06:23:42,f4l7qs,"Yeah, I like him too. He‚Äôs just having fun. Trying to bring comedic relief to the show even though he is highly intelligent"
769,2020-02-16 10:30:01,f4l7qs,It seems like Robin‚Äôs guesses are 90% Nicole‚Äôs.
770,2020-02-16 06:28:27,f4l7qs,Second this
771,2020-02-16 05:47:47,f4l7qs,I can‚Äôt stand her. I wish they would just get rid of her.
772,2020-02-16 13:57:46,f4l7qs,"I feel like Robin has barely been seen this season and I guess it's because he's so knowledgeable of voices.   He's my favorite panelist so it's disappointing.

And I'm with the group here, I don't mind Ken but Jenny is beyond grating."
773,2020-02-16 17:12:18,f4l7qs,Same I think I‚Äôm the only one who likes Nicole
774,2020-02-16 08:43:49,f4l7qs,"He was a pop of humor when it started, then it got to be a little over the top, which started putting me off but it seems like they are trying to reel him in this season by not giving him an opportunity to make those long rants. I hope this trend continues because truthfully I would like to be able to enjoy him again."
775,2020-02-16 06:32:02,f4l7qs,Exactly... he‚Äôs the comedic relief of the show.

777,2020-02-16 13:22:22,f4l7qs,It's his job to make those wild guesses. If every judge was on the money the show wouldn't be as exciting.

780,2020-02-17 03:05:14,f4l7qs,"Even Rob? I don‚Äôt mind him nearly as much as the others. He‚Äôs not great, for sure, but I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs nearly as bad as Jenny, Nicole, and Ken."
781,2020-02-16 14:39:14,f4l7qs,"I‚Äôve noticed the panel isn‚Äôt getting as much time and sometimes, only one or two guesses is actually getting out, so I wonder if he‚Äôs nailing his guesses and they‚Äôre editing him out to not give it away so early."
782,2020-02-16 17:28:43,f4l7qs,Agreed!
783,2020-02-16 07:04:03,f4l7qs,"Definitely. He's playing cn over the top character. And he's doing it well. He knows how preposterous some of his guesses are and they're meant to make people cringe. 

Its ridiculous, yes, but credit to him for being so effective.  The fact we're talking about it here means he's doing his job."
784,2020-02-16 07:50:13,f4l7qs,I just don't see the comedy in his comedic relief though. I get humor is subjective but every time he's trying to be funny I can only envision children enjoying it
785,2020-02-16 13:53:27,f4l7qs,"He seriously guessed Barack Obama?!?! 

Realistically, he can‚Äôt be on this show. The amount of Secret Service security around the studio will give it away."
786,2020-02-17 11:59:44,f4l7qs,He's fine honestly. I just lump him in by association.
787,2020-02-16 14:58:37,f4l7qs,"That's what I was figuring, he must have the record for most correct guesses."
788,2020-02-16 08:18:22,f4l7qs,Search his name on google and literally he is branded as a comedian lol there are roles in the entertainment industry whether you agree with them or not
789,2020-02-16 09:12:28,f4l7qs,"when did i say anything about his filmography or he wasn't a comedian? I wasn't familiar with him before this show so i have no knowledge on what I think of him outside of the show. It's ok if you like him, he's just not my cup of tea."
790,2020-02-16 20:23:30,f4l7qs,"Lmao chilllll, hope you feel better üòÇ"
791,2020-02-15 20:51:56,f4f58x,"I really enjoyed it and was surprised by the decent mix of celebs.

- A Super Sneak Peek episode in the same slot as the DOI launch last year. Have >!Queen Bee!< sing Have Yourself A Merry Little Xmas or something while we get everyone's first clue packages.
- A lion costume. It's the second most used costume worldwide after the monster and before the unicorn. Bewildered to why there wasn't one this series.
- Other costumes I'd like to see: spider, robot, teddy bear, poodle, alien, parrot, knight, panther, deer, and give the wolf in sheep's clothing they nixed from this series a chance
- A singer in drag. But it's NOT Courtney. Courtney HAS TO king up for the show.
- >!Nicola!<, Seal and Chaka Khan as guest judges. 
- A list of accolades including Grammies, Brits, marriages, children, Royal Variety performances, Queen's Honours, Olympic gold medals, World Cup wins etc.
- Could Smackdowns work? Where the bottom two sing and then, instead of the judges, the audience vote for who stays?
- Me in the audience"

794,2020-02-15 22:08:58,f4f58x,"I was originally worried about the star quality that we would get, but it actually ended up being quite a decent list in the end, with the lesser two names being the first two out. My age showed a little as Skin was the only one I didn't know before the show (but I'm happy it at least introduced me to Skunk Anansie. Weak has been added to the playlist now because that song is great). 

I'm not sure if we'll ever get to the levels that the 3rd Season of the US series seems to be getting, but I imagine expectations will be high for the faces behind the mask in Season 2.

Main thing I want to see more of is 1 on 1 sing-offs for survival (not counting the Round 1 stuff here). Those are fun, but we only got them in Ep 3 and 4. Chameleon's reaction to Duck's singing opera is practically meme worthy, so I just want more TV watching reactions like that."
795,2020-02-15 20:57:42,f4f58x,Would love to see fewer musical theatre tunes on series two. don‚Äôt get me wrong - I LOVE musicals - but I think the show works better with radio hits.

800,2020-02-16 13:42:10,f4f58x,"I hadn't seen any adverts or anything for this, I just happened to flick to ITV as the first episode was starting and thought 'what the ruddy hell is this?'. I watched a little bit and just couldn't stop watching.

I got more in to it with each week and really enjoyed it.

I thought the standard of celeb they had for the first series was really good and so I expect even bigger names for series 2.

For series 2 I'd like them to stop doing the pointless thing where they ask the panel who they think is under the mask after their performance, only to then ask them again 5 minutes later when the person voted out is announced and they are set to unmask. They could save some time by not asking them twice.

I've always thought Nicola Roberts was cute, but I'm basically in love with her now. She's been so adorable playing Queen Bee with her mannerisms, and she just seems like the sweetest, loveliest girl.

I'd love them to get an active sports star - they had Teddy Sheringham this year, but someone still playing would be great. Someone from WWE would be amazing - someone like John Cena would probably be up for it but that's more likely to happen on the US version if anything.

I'd also really like them to get in someone who was regularly guessed as one of this years participants, so someone like Eddie Izzard for example.

Someone I'd really love to see would be Seth McFarlane (though again he would likely do the US version if at all) as he is actually a really good singer and should be lots of fun."

It'd be interesting to see either of these guys making a appearance, but the only thing is, I'm not sure if many people have heard of them, especially JME since I feel like the UK Rap scene is pretty underrated so if they appeared on the scene & if they get unmasked, people might think ""who's this?"", although I'm to down to see some Rappers becoming a Masked Singer though.

I think we all feared it‚Äôd be Van Day level, but thankfully those being the stalwarts of reality TV seems to have died out in the 00s. Maybe it‚Äôs because the nostalgia for the audience has aged up too - so less 80s and more 90s and 00s 

Would love somebody from Steps or S Club to see if my teenage years playing exclusively then were wasted. I‚Äôll eat my hat if an ex Glee cast member doesn‚Äôt show up on this or the US version soon.

She hasn't performed AT ALL this era, but just today she liked a tweet which basically boiled down to ""please come to Brazil!"". Wonder if she'll do series 2 to help her gain confidence. She's also heavily influenced by US!Bee and toured with US!Leopard.

891,2020-02-15 13:47:08,f2m06m,Too many         was it improve or scripted questions in every episode. Here it is justified with the improve scenes but every guest has been asked this same question
892,2020-02-16 15:26:14,f2m06m,Enjoyable episode and Joel McHale popping in was unexpected.
893,2020-02-12 19:18:50,f2m06m,"I'm really trying to like this show, but Angela is soooooo cringey that it's really difficult. I never knew someone saying ""shitake mushrooms"" instead of ""shit"" could be so annoying. 

Her pretending to go off on Jenna for not having seen Game of Thrones or Star Wars was embarrassing. ""Jenna, you don't know HORDor??"""
894,2020-02-13 04:04:19,f2m06m,I'm so puzzled by heavily edited podcasts. Even The West Wing Weekly suffered significantly from over-editing. Nothing turns me away from a cast quicker than overproduction.
895,2020-02-12 19:10:00,f2m06m,"Oh wow I didn‚Äôt know I wanted this. I wonder who would be good as hosts. I like cast members to describe what is going on on set rather than Dan Harmon breaking down layers in the writing (did a little bit of this in Harmontown)

Maybe Gilly and Alison Brie?"
896,2020-02-12 17:04:54,f2m06m,Damn that‚Äôs a good name. I bet we see a ton of rewatch podcasts coming out in the next year. Zach Braff teased a Scrubs one on Twitter with a picture of him and Donald Faison yesterday.

899,2020-02-13 01:34:17,f2m06m,I find the way she says m'lady pretty cringey. I feel like she is harmless and sweet but a bit cringey in general.
900,2020-02-13 03:40:59,f2m06m,"Yeah, they're both pretty corny, but I still enjoy most of it."
901,2020-02-12 22:03:54,f2m06m,"Yeah Angela is a bit much, but hopefully she will settle down as they get more experienced"
902,2020-02-16 08:41:10,f2m06m,"I've dropped many podcasts for not enough editing. Talking Simpsons had so much unrelated chatter, I would listen with my finger on the ""skip 30 sec"" button, until I realized that was crazy. And it's apparently gotten worse- I've seen some posts saying episode discussion doesn't start until 30 minutes in."
903,2020-02-12 21:20:46,f2m06m,PFT can break down his episode where he tried to pick up Abed.
904,2020-02-12 22:02:41,f2m06m,I didn't watch community but I would definitely listen to Gillian and Alison
905,2020-02-13 18:31:57,f2m06m,Yes totally dvd commentary has gone away and so as long as it‚Äôs from the people on the show I‚Äôm all down for it.
906,2020-02-13 00:18:20,f2m06m,"Then you're a real piece of shitake mushrooms. 

Just kidding! I respect your opinion."

920,2020-02-09 15:51:18,f0x45h,"Jeong is clearly a sellout Chan. Yang has done some Chan-ish BS but he isn't yet on the same level as Uncle Jeong.  I give Yang just a wee bit of leeway since he's a candidate trying to win the nomination and thus need the mainstream and public supports to pull it off (he shouldn't be completely off the hook and free of criticism, obviously). It's something of a miracle that an AM candidate has gotten this far.    

All in all, no AM public figure is going to be as woke as those us posting here, at least not publicly.  We're going to have to do our best to filler and strike a balance between support and criticize when they do/say Chan-ish stuffs."

926,2020-04-17 23:11:55,g3cgyr,"Thanks for the heads up, will give it a listen"
927,2020-04-18 11:34:52,g3cgyr,"It's good when they're being sincere, talking about Community or when Ken is giving his informed, professional opinion.

They're not adept podcast hosts or natural comedians imo though. So it's far less enjoyable when they keep reverting to this shtick where they both take jabs at each other and drag the bit out for far too long."
928,2020-04-18 14:52:21,g3cgyr,"directed an ad with Ken Jeong once.  He got it in his head that I wasn't giving him enough respect.  Before you roll the camera you rehearse what's called blocking.  You set marks on the floor so the camera man knows where the actors are going to be.  It's for lighting and focus.  You do this with a stand in, then you bring in the real actor in the case of a celeb.  Until the actual actor is in it's a 'best guess' situation.  We did this, brought Ken in and I asked him to please just rehearse what he wanted to do so we can make some final adjustments to accommodate his performance specifics.  I thought I was being polite and respectful.  The worst is if we start rolling, he does something great and it's not useable because his blocking was super different.  He took this as me 'using him as a stand in' and fucking went OFF ON ME.  He was such a huge crazy prick to me in front of my crew.  My producer called cut just so things didn't get out of hand.  I went to his dressing room to 'apologize?' and he screamed at me referring to himself in the 3rd person etc.  I just said 'sorry' not because I understood but because I had to get my day for my client.  

TLDR:  Ken Jeong screamed at me while directing an ad with him and I still don't really know why.  I think he might be a crazy person or just an asshole."
929,2020-04-18 03:17:09,g3cgyr,"I've enjoyed the podcast so far. Other commenters seem to have some harsh opinions, but I think that Joel and Ken have a great chemistry together and I plan to keep listening."
930,2020-04-18 00:30:53,g3cgyr,Kinda lost interest when they brought Andrew Yang on. Nothing against Yang himself but it was so embarrassing to listen to Joel and Ken kiss his ass for half an hour straight that it's hard to go back to listening to them do their thing. Some next level cringy ass kissing from both of them the entire time through no fault of Yang.
931,2020-04-18 00:15:44,g3cgyr,"Listened to the first episode and wasn‚Äôt that much of a fan; it felt pretty rigid and like the chemistry wasn‚Äôt there. I think I was expecting too much of Jeff Winger from Joel McHale.

I think Danny Pudi was on the most recent episode, though, so I might give that a shot."
932,2020-04-18 23:08:18,g3cgyr,"Great actors, but I don't think they're very entertaining otherwise. Tried the Joel McHale Show and Ken's stand-up...pretty disappointing."

934,2020-04-18 00:53:57,g3cgyr,Damn the comments here seem so salty. To respond to some of them here: Ken and Joel are awesome and definitely have chemistry. Joel very mutch resembles Jeff. Yang dide seem interested and happy to be there.

942,2020-04-18 00:32:38,g3cgyr,"Same. Listened to the second with Andrew Yang and personally couldn't help but feel that it was just celebrity banter. Even Andrew looked annoyed lol. Perhaps with it being him, I assumed they'd be a bit more serious and ask in depth questions but at the end of the day... it depends on what you're looking for a in podcast. I just revisit Harmontown when I need a laugh."
943,2020-04-23 01:17:20,g3cgyr,Joel McHale is actually so good in podcasts. He‚Äôs calm and cool and very ‚ÄòWinger‚Äô. I stumbled upon this podcast looking for more with him. The stinker here is Ken Jeong. He takes up all the air I. The room and isn‚Äôt funny.
944,2020-08-25 15:34:01,g3cgyr,Sometimes they talk about blm stuff and that can turn the comment section into an ugly mess so a lot of people putting content on youtube switched them off.
945,2020-04-18 04:03:43,g3cgyr,"Like I said I've only listened to one episode and it's a new podcast. Everything you mentioned is probably on the radar of most Harmontown fans. I already listen to CBB but just because Dan liked Lore and No Sleep does not make either of those anything like Harmontown. Smartest Man is just bad though. Proops only works for me in the smallest of doses.

Darkest Timeline is a potential podcast for at least fans of Community though."
946,2020-04-18 15:03:27,g3cgyr,"Jrvp is where it's at now, if someone's looking for an unwarrented opinion."
947,2020-08-25 15:29:09,g3cgyr,"lol, late reply but i feel the exact same, its fine and im glad i listened to it but Fake doctors is significantly better, even though i would never have put scrubs in Communitys tier."
948,2020-04-20 16:02:57,g3cgyr,"He also wasn't nearly as funny as he thought he was. 
Kept referring to 'knocked up' as the avengers of comedy because the cast was so 'stacked'.  Was weird.  There's a reason he's on masked singer I guess.  He was funny in knocked up though.

958,2020-04-17 06:33:11,g2nkn4,Just a warning as you said you're starting S4....stay strong.. it gets better... in S5. If you're not in the ''known''. S4 is considered the gas leak year.
959,2020-04-17 04:08:03,g2nkn4,Chevy chase was the funniest part of the show
960,2020-04-17 01:21:33,g2nkn4,S3 had a lot of great episodes and moments but it was horrible for the characters. Nearly every one of them became extremely flanderized. IMO the show never recovered from it.
961,2020-04-17 01:04:27,g2nkn4,We are rewatching and just saw the season 1 episode where they kick Pierce out but then bring him back because they need someone to pick on or they turn on each other.  So it provides an in-story explanation of why they keep him in the group when he clearly does not fit in.
962,2020-04-16 21:34:36,g2nkn4,"Community has been my favourite comedy show since I watched it over a decade ago. I hated that it ended, esp given there was a lot of stuff that could have been done better. I won't mention those as you're still 2 seasons behind from the finale.

There are just so many characters to love. Abed & Troy are a treasure. Donald Glover is too likeable and adorable as Troy and Abed is one of the most fascinating characters I've seen on a show. Jeffrey's growth as a person from a selfish prick to a loving friend is truly incredible. I agree on Chevy Chase. I think I've read comments that he was basically playing Pierce as a very close to real version of himself. Maybe that's why he was convincing.

Among the girls I started with Britta as my favourite but Alison Brie as Annie definitely had better written role in comparison in latter seasons. Britta started as a wannabee rebel but actually happened to be a master of none, who had insecurites and vulnerability but imo was reduced to a dumb blonde later. Shirley was OK.

They should have done more to expand Jeff and Abed's friendship in the middle seasons though instead of the last couple of seasons.

I liked Dean all right and I too share your changoversial opinion about Senor Chang. He was mostly a hit but they dragged certain pieces with him.
I agree on John Oliver. He was alright in the first season but in the latter ones he was not really funny.


I hope you enjoy the rest of the show."
963,2020-04-19 00:24:32,g2nkn4,"With the genre thing and  hitting a lot of those types of episodes close together, if remember correctly hearing when it was on air that they were shocked they got a second season and got nervous they would be canceled after season 2 so they threw everything at the wall that year in case they didn't get another.

Edit: Grammer and wrong words"
964,2020-04-23 17:26:39,g2nkn4,"Keep in mind that every season after season 2, they thought they would be cancelled. So the finales for 3, 4, 5, and 6 were all made to function as an ending in case they wouldn't be renewed (although season 6 is a pretty definitive ending)."
965,2020-04-17 05:14:34,g2nkn4,"Agreed. Pierce was an awful person, but the character worked within the show as the racist grandpa that no one particularly liked but tolerated."

1015,2020-04-12 03:00:46,fyybaq,What show
1016,2020-04-11 22:32:20,fyybaq,I legitimately thought it was a joke when I first saw the ads. What a toilet world.
1017,2020-04-11 14:11:01,fyybaq,Man I'm glad I finally finished S4. I think I only burst out laughing two times. It's so crazy how different the final episode of S3 to first episode of S4 was. I went from being the laugh factory to crickets just like that.
1018,2020-04-12 04:18:08,fyybaq,"The masked singer

I just looked awful, so I arbitrarily talked shit about it, as many of us are guilty of...

Then they had an episode right after the super bowl and I was so shot I watched the whole fucking thing and it was worse then I thought it could be 

Ken jeong is the worst of it. His fucking ridiculous reactions to everything are just awful, and unfortunately he's probably the main draw on the show.

A few weeks went by and I forget for what reason but it came on and I was either too stoned or too lazy to find the remote so I was just dicking around on reddit with it playing in the background and even just listening and seeing a second or two made me have to get up to change it."

1022,2020-04-12 10:28:46,fyybaq,Thank you for that
1023,2020-04-11 14:45:38,fyybaq,The episode with Brie Larson was pretty good
1024,2020-04-12 01:39:16,fyybaq,"No, 4 isn‚Äôt THAT bad. It‚Äôs not as good as the other seasons, but the majority of comments you see talking about how bad it is are people just parroting it because it‚Äôs the popular opinion. I did a rewatch a little while back and 4 wasn‚Äôt nearly as bad as people would have you think."
1025,2020-04-11 20:45:38,fyybaq,5 and 6 are definitely good. I don't think they touch the highs of 1-3 but the show's worth it to watch all the way through.
1026,2020-04-11 15:57:10,fyybaq,There's no movie lol.
1027,2020-04-11 16:01:41,fyybaq,True. True true true.
1028,2020-04-11 17:05:35,fyybaq,What about 6 seasons and a movie? :(
1029,2020-04-11 20:08:37,fyybaq,Netflix picked up the show. They might fund the film. Might.
1030,2020-04-11 19:37:56,fyybaq,"You can straight up just skip season 4. It has no bearing on the rest of the show, they got rid of dan harmon but brought him back for the last two seasons because there‚Äôs no magic without him. Season 4 isn‚Äôt acknowledged in the rest of the show beyond calling it the year of the gas leak. 

It‚Äôs really bad."
1031,2020-04-11 20:38:33,fyybaq,I'm pretty sure them just having the show on Netflix doesn't mean they plan on making more of it.
1032,2020-04-12 07:16:52,fyybaq,That is sad

1034,2020-04-10 13:25:02,fy9b4d,I like others in here have no idea who she is. Shes a friend of the kardashians and thats what made her famous?

1036,2020-04-10 06:47:25,fy9b4d,I have never heard of her before I watched this episode.
1037,2020-04-10 16:33:10,fy9b4d,"I have no idea who she is, but the fact that people did guess her immediately is proof enough that she is someone famous... just outside my circle. Congrats to everyone that figured it out."
1038,2020-04-10 05:38:19,fy9b4d,i agree
1039,2020-04-10 06:10:17,fy9b4d,She was surprisingly talented. Real hidden talent
1040,2020-04-10 06:45:43,fy9b4d,I honestly have no idea who she is. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1041,2020-04-10 06:14:48,fy9b4d,She‚Äôs lovely and her voice was lovely
1042,2020-04-10 19:33:52,fy9b4d,I guessed her early on but wasn‚Äôt 100% sure that she had a voice like that. I hope someone gets her a good writer and she puts out some bops!
1043,2020-04-10 06:23:40,fy9b4d,"she‚Äôs not too niche, i‚Äôd say"
1044,2020-04-10 06:11:42,fy9b4d,"Gross. 

Idolizing celebs is weird. 
Worshiping people who aren‚Äôt even D level celebs.....yuck."
1045,2020-04-10 16:04:22,fy9b4d,She was very good friends with the Kardashians (specifically Kylie) and ended up messing around with one of their husbands (Tristan Thompson). So she's been rightfully vilified along with Thompson for being garbage humans.
1046,2020-04-11 17:56:08,fy9b4d,"Google her, famous before them."
1047,2020-04-10 15:18:44,fy9b4d,"Turtle is the other one I am disproportionately excited for. 5th-grade me is READY! About five years ago, I actually accidentally saw him live lol while clubbing in AC.

Which reveals have been your favorite?"
1048,2020-04-10 07:19:46,fy9b4d,Same
1049,2020-04-10 16:57:54,fy9b4d,Good point! Who have been your favorites/people you‚Äôve guessed?
1050,2020-04-10 06:23:04,fy9b4d,"I had no idea of this about her! She should do voice training. Not saying she needs to release music or anything, but she should explore this side of her."
1051,2020-04-10 06:57:22,fy9b4d,Me neither. She and Ana Gasteyer were the only two people I hadn‚Äôt heard of before on TMS.
1052,2020-04-10 06:29:31,fy9b4d,"I don‚Äôt think so, since her name was EVERYWHERE. I definitely see the argument that she is, because in writing this post I couldn‚Äôt think of an actual ‚Äútalent‚Äù lol. 

But modelling is treated like a commodity, and I argue she is serving up something fresh in looks (heck Khloe called her fat, having struggled with that label herself is so vicious)"
1053,2020-04-10 06:19:43,fy9b4d,"I don‚Äôt idolize her, TMS showed me she has a hidden talent (decent enough) and she looked great! :-)"

1056,2020-04-10 07:17:25,fy9b4d,"Haha, understandable! Actually impressive that you‚Äôve heard of everyone else!

She is a socialite I guess, her dad was in the music industry & she is close to the Smith family (Will, Jaden, etc.) as well as the Kardashian-Jenners (Kylie Jenner‚Äôs BFF). She has worked with beauty & fashion brands, modelled on IG, apparently DJ‚Äôd in the past??, and acted, all relatively small projects. 

She gained major recognition when she went to a house party at Cavaliers 6th man Tristan Thompson‚Äôs home and ‚Äúsomething happened‚Äù. He is notorious for openly cheating on his baby mamas but was on/off with new mom Khloe Kardashian at the time. The Kardashians shunned her but have welcomed TT back.


It was a pretty big deal in terms of entertainment news for 2019. I like to quote Gwyneth Paltrow‚Äôs response to the situation, ‚ÄúCan someone explain what‚Äôs going on? I have never heard of half of these people, someone give me context. Please. It seems serious.‚Äù I‚Äôm sure many can relate to this quote. üòÖ"
1057,2020-04-10 07:28:34,fy9b4d,"right, that‚Äôs what i mean. she‚Äôs well-known & talented, not just known as a friend of celebrities"

I'm not your ""bruh"".......put me on your ignore list if you don't like how I post. Then go make 20 posts about how awesome JoJo is (celeb worship is creepy)."
1059,2020-04-10 23:37:19,fy9b4d,"Yes, Sarah Palin & Seal were great reveals for me too!! Of course she rapped!! And just how happy Seal looked and the fact he was doing it for his little ones üòÅ"
1060,2020-04-10 10:23:40,fy9b4d,"The sad part is their brand is trying to look like female empowerment but they do not treat him as equally like they treated Jordyn. And that's what is sad about all this...Tristan is just as to blame, if not more, for this mess."
1061,2020-04-10 07:33:38,fy9b4d,"Yep, totally agreeing with you! I guess providing the other side & reiterating my/our points out of feeling the need to defend my thoughts as many feel insulted by her inclusion."

1063,2020-04-10 15:26:19,fy9b4d,Tristan is a piece of doo doo. He is a classic cheater enjoying the women aspect of NBA fame. But Khloe took him back even though he openly cheated while she was pregnant. She completely used Jordyn as a scapegoat for her ongoing problems.
1064,2020-04-10 16:02:38,fy9b4d,"Lol - oh look!
The dude complaining about being negative is now throwing out insults!!!!

And commenting on a TV show is the same as somebody who worships celebs..........LMFAO, that took a lot of mental gymnastics to make that comparison.   And didn't you say I was being negative? That would kind of negate that idea of me worshiping the celebs then, wouldn't it?

Wow. Just wow"

1067,2020-04-05 17:21:50,fvbxw1,"You are describing Ken Jeong now, which is vastly different than when he was basically trying to get himself in as an actor and voluntarily took ""sell-out"" roles (i.e. Hangover series).  I think the hate comes from the latter.  

Currently, Ken has been working hard to promote Asian American image; his disfunct doctor show hired alot of Asian cast members.  He was in CRA which was a positive for Asian representation in Hollywood.  But, that doesn't really negate his past actions, to many Asian men.  

I personally don't care what he does.  No one has ever compared me with him.  I don't look anything like him.  I understand that if he didn't take that role in Hangover, they would have found another (hungry) Asian actor that will fill that role anyways."
1068,2020-04-05 17:56:14,fvbxw1,"Most people here hate Ken Jeong and Jimmy O Yang and Matthew Moy for reasons entirely unrelated to their acting ability of talent.  They remind many of the people who post here of themselves, which is why there is so much vitriol directed towards them, entirely illogical.  Jeong is the best example of this.

Ken Jeong has had an amazing career considering he started out as a Doctor who moonlighted as a stand up comic.  He turned that into a full blown acting career in film and TV (having his own sitcom on network TV).  

Ken also friends Simu Liu who people here admire.  Simu only has kind words for Ken, yet the people here have this illogical hate for him.  He's also worked with and friends with Jon Chu.   Judd Apatow and Jamie Foxx love working with him.  He's won an East West Players Award, an Asian American organization that actually does productive stuff, unlike 99% of the BS Asian American orgs out there.  

People in Hollywood tend to love him, he's open about his family life and how much he loves his wife.  He also has dabbled into Directing and made a great 30 for 30.  He's a great example of hardwork and talent, and it's never too late to change careers no matter how deep into another career you've had.  

Yet people here hate him because he's um, short and played a flamboyant Vietnamese gangster in the decade's biggest comedy?  Talk about projecting.  

As for Community, he was amazing in that.  I kind of wish Ken Jeong would have gotten a Showtime/HBO or FX deal like Donald Glover after.  Ken's comedy is meant more for cable.  I felt like on ABC he was restricted.  If you listen to his stand up, it's pretty profane and can get dark, definitely fit more for HBO than ABC.  Maybe in the future he can start a darker comedy like Atlanta.  I see that in the future, both as an actor and director.  

There's a great episode of Ken Jeong on Hot Ones, if you can find it.  I think it's exclusive now to a network, as Hot Ones took it off Youtube."
1069,2020-04-07 09:37:47,fvbxw1,"Here is Ken Jeong‚Äôs magnum opus.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqAeCX\_sRIw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqAeCX_sRIw)  


Watch this short clip and tell me isn‚Äôt a piece of shit."
1070,2020-04-08 06:23:07,fvbxw1,"Time is everything, and comedians like Ken Jeong and Bobby Lee just don't fit into how Asians need to portray ourselves in 2020.

If we didn't face racism and people identified us as individuals this wouldn't be an issue, but we need to be cognizant of everything that is going on. How are are engendered by the media and society requires an approach that counters current perceptions."
1071,2020-04-07 09:34:46,fvbxw1,"I‚Äôve watched Community at least 3 times through and as much as I love Harmon‚Äôs work, he is anti-AM.  In community, Asian women are portrayed as the sexy Annie Kim in a school girl outfit or the sexy Chinese towelette heiress who will marry Pierce.

The asian men are fat rejects like the math club.  Which doesn‚Äôt even make sense.  Why would there be a math club full of Asian nerds at Greendale Community College?

Ken Jeong is treated as disgusting and looked down on by the fat black woman, Shirley, he has sex with.  The fact that he has a hot Latina wife is made as more of a joke.

What‚Äôs worse is that Chang even creates a new stereotype of Asian men crying about discrimination.  In multiple episodes he does this, including the pilot and the Bear down for midterms one.

sorry man, you need to rewatch it more thoroughly."
1072,2020-04-08 08:10:40,fvbxw1,"People here criticize Ken Jeong and Bobby Lee. What they fail to realize was times were different back then. People never really judged Asians based on what they saw of Bobby Lee on MadTV.

Given that the other option was no representation, I think Bobby Lee and Ken Jeong did their job to get Asians into the media. The only other Asian representation I can remember clearly growing up in western media was that was modern at the time was reporter Connie Chung who's in a WMAF relationship."
1073,2020-04-07 18:37:33,fvbxw1,"I haven't watched a lot of Ken Jeong, but I would like to see his work put in the context of Asian comedy during the mid-century. He seems like an absurd character and absurdist humor as a trend seems more prevalent in Asian comedy acts.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manzai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manzai)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean\_comedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_comedy) (would be interested in Korean comedians pre-1990s)

You also have to think what someone like Ken Jeong would have for role models (Asian American actors) growing up. I found this guy, Idk if ""They Call Me Bruce"" aged well, since I've never seen it. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny\_Yune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Yune)"
1074,2020-04-07 05:04:55,fvbxw1,There‚Äôs that GQ magazine stuff he did as well pretty recently though. It‚Äôs pretty degrading to himself and to Asian American image.
1075,2020-04-05 17:58:59,fvbxw1,">.  No one has ever compared me with him. I don't look anything like him.

See, exactly what I'm talking about.  This weird paranoia that somehow people will relate this 1 Asian American comedian to them.  And this weird paranoia that you somehow look alike/don't look alike.

It'd be the equivalent of African American dudes freaking out about looking like/not looking like RuPaul or Prince.  People here are weird."
1076,2020-04-05 23:40:08,fvbxw1,Plus there was a video of his standup comedy that was posted where he basically makes the same stereotypical Asian jokes.

1144,2020-04-03 09:29:00,ftwq72,"Bernies campaign is entirely an online phenomenon, it's just that it was way bigger. If Andrew can grow to that level of support online, not in terms of vocal intensity, but in terms of total people on board, it will translate to boots on the ground. The problem with Yang is that most of the people who would be early converts to his message, the progressive youth that want to see political solutions, are either Bernie supporters, or they have a pet issue, like they want to see a gay man, or a black person or a woman as the next head of state so they aren't looking at issues. Bernie's got flaws, but one of them isn't ""no throngs of young idealists supporting him."" 

There's a really big popular trend that is currently still strong but I'm hoping will start to die out which is a reductionist argument that ""capitalism bad; problem: capitalism; solution: abolish capitalism,"" instead of the more accurate ""capitalism efficient; problem: poorly structured capitalism efficiently creates many problems; solution: structure capitalism better.""

As long as people allergically react to capitalism and refuse to think about it, they will gravitate to Bernie or other agonists to capitalism and ignore the fact that everything they like about living is available to them because of the success of capitalism, and all the problems are pretty straight forward issues with failures to structure capitalism in a manner that guides markets where we want them to end up. Yang is offering market driven solutions, because those are the kinds of solutions that historically work the best, but it's not trendy to do anything other than talk shit about capitalism with people who don't have any experience in it or it's alternatives."
1145,2020-04-03 15:28:49,ftwq72,"Well, he got the CNN job so there's that. But I think the internet (at least the broadest platforms) should be his focus. Time will work in favor of this strategy. Regular TV and its shrinking base of older viewers will have to shift over.

I do see your concern about translating to real support especially looking at what happened to Bernie's campaign. He seemed to appeal to the under 35s who don't seem to vote. Maybe the focus should be 35-55s?"

1168,2020-04-01 02:52:05,fso2lm,"South Asians have less of a history in this country than East Asians do. I know many people would view East Asians as a more advanced or acculturated race than South Asians, just based on our foreignness and the perceived positive stereotypes that come with East Asians."
1169,2020-04-01 04:43:55,fso2lm,"I absolutely agree that as a whole, S Asians in the community don't have it as bad as many claim and there are a lot of great things in media and pop culture as well as politics and technology. I am very proud to be an Indian, and as someone born and lived there for 8 years and have lived in the US since, I have not gotten outrightly harassed for my race (of course I've received mild racism, but I don't really care about that. Most of the time it's funny), but I've had to stand up to many of my Filipino/a and other East Asian friends who were  being harassed. 

But the main difficulty, at least me, is that Indian culture is not nearly as integrated into mainstream life as East Asian. I know you touched on Anime and Kpop, but one of the most popular and influential music groups of all time is named Wu-Tang clan. Panda Express, PF Chang's are massive restaurant chains. Boba, sushi, chow mein are some of the most popular dishes in America. Kids all across the country do arts and crafts for Chinese New Year. Cities have entire parades and festivals. 

In terms of shows, Kim's Convenience is a great show I highly recommend watching on Netflix that does a really good job of making the kids both Korean and Western, growing up in equal lifestyles whereas the parents, whose values are more inbuilt are adjusting and gradually continue to learn new things, just like I remember myself and my family doing with Indian culture.

For indians, I've never seen a show where the Indian kid speaks the native language without an accent and English without an accent. Most bilingual kids who were brought up speaking another language do that. Kim's Convenience, Fresh Off the Boat both feature that. 

 Instead we got Karan Brar and Kunal Nayyar whose indianness were summed up in their attire (that Brar later ditched) and phony accent that was many people's first introductions to Indians in TV/film. The only time we see more of Indian culture it's ""Ooh, let's have the cast do a Bollywood dance number""

There is no equivalent for Indians, or at least not one that is nearly as influential or one that Ive heard of. Any celebration of India immediately skips to Bollywood, which is huge, is not even the whole country. Very few countries are as complicatedly diverse as India, but South India is represented the exact same as North India, and I've personally had to just amalgamate into being ""Indian"" rather than my stronger regional identity since people could associate something more general (I'm sure I'm not the only immigrant) and because of the edging towards the mainstream, I'm not as culturally attached to Tamil Nadu (a S Indian state) as my parents but I do love Bollywood, which is more Central-North. 

That's just because Indians haven't been a part of the US as long. Chinese immigrants helped build the west in the mid 1800s. In 50 years? There's no telling the massive Indian franchises and Diwali celebrations that could happen. 

In terms of succeeding, yes there have been great Indian *individuals* who have succeeded, but as a group? East Asia had kicked the collective asses of everyone twice over. Nintendo, Sony, Toshiba, Toyota, Acura, the list is endless."
1170,2020-04-01 00:55:35,fso2lm,"I think you make some good points.
I think on thing that separates S and E Asians is that S Asians seem to be more proud of their culture, for better or worse. For example, yes, S Asians tend to value white skin which is a problem, but they don't actually value white people. Most desi moms want their son to marry a light skinned *desi* girl, not white future Karen. Whereas I know Asian moms who may even encourage their children to marry white people because they see it as superior / better prospects than Asians."
1171,2020-04-01 02:03:48,fso2lm,"I mean its partially that whole thing with the feminization of the East Asian sort of race. Desis don't really have that gender association with them. There are some other unfortunate associations like Desis aren't attractive, etc. but for the most part there is no sort of feminization of Desis. Desis, in general, come from similar cultural values as conservative America and I guess a lot of the mindset is 'accessible'. Desis also entered the US mainstream when their image wasn't fully formed. While Asians were tainted by US stereotypes and culture for years, think about if the same has happened to Desis. They largely migrated during the 1990s and 2000s when it was 'cool' to have black friends and the culture wasn't as conservative. I don't know if there's any data to back it up but that's how I feel."

1175,2020-04-01 07:25:34,fso2lm,"Good post. I'm opposite of you: South Asian but grew up in a majority East Asian community in the US and most of my friends all my life have been EA. 

I think related to your post there is too much glorification in the EA community for simply getting into Harvard or Stanford and become X profession (doctor, lawyer, etc). 

This also occurs in the SA community but I think a lot of SA parents would be perfectly fine with their kid going to UCLA and starting a business and making money that way. Or going to a medical school in the Caribbean. They have a longer term view of education and career, and the point is to make money in the long run. 

EA seemed to me to just think that if they went to X school that is it."

1177,2020-04-01 16:00:45,fso2lm,"I won't speak to all of your points because I think many have done so already and that's a waste of time, but I join those who wholeheartedly disagree with your assessment that you have it harder. 

Sure maybe there are more South Asian CEOs, but that doesn't really make a difference on a day to day basis for most young Desis. When I consider who was most accepted at school- in middle school, high school, and college- it's East Asians hands down. Look at pictures from any sorority house. Who is more likely to rush at the houses seen as desirable? East Asians, obviously. Many Indian women, when they walk into a room of blonde haired blue eyed women, automatically feel a sense of exclusion. There's just this vibe you get that people will assume you have an accent and smell like curry and not wear deodorant, even if it's not true. Unless of course you wear colored contacts, dye your hair blonde, and/or spend a fortune on designer clothes.

In middle school dances, we had one activity where all the names of the kids in our class were stuck to the wall backwards (so you couldn't see the name.) The boys would pick the name of a girl and the girls would pick the name of a boy. But in our class, there were more girls than boys, so some girls didn't get a dance partner. The names of the girls that were trampled on the floor, discarded when a boy picked a name, wasn't satisfied, and reached for another, were always those of the Indian girls. 

My own boyfriend admits that although he finds me attractive, it was difficult for him to see me as a sexual object because he's just not used to seeing Indians portrayed that way anywhere."
1178,2020-04-01 03:46:55,fso2lm,Thought provoking analysis.
1179,2020-04-01 15:07:12,fso2lm,"I think it's worth noting that, while you mention that ""noticed there have been more successful South Asians in Hollywood,"" it's worth pointing out that the rise of prominent South Asians in Hollywood is **very** recent. Most of the famous South Asian celebs have only gotten famous in the past few years, and if anything, this happened because these celebs were able to ride the wave of diversity that Hollywood is pushing for. 

Up until 2010 or so, South Asians were essentially invisible/non-existent in Hollywood, and any South Asian characters were often stereotypes and/or played by actors of another ethnicity.

If anything, South and East Asians have faced the same problems when it comes to media representation, with the key differences being that South Asians had a much more compressed timeline, as East Asians have had a cultural presence in America for a longer period of time."
1180,2020-04-01 15:34:11,fso2lm,"I think a lot of your points do seem valid at first glance but when you scratch the surface a bit they don't hold up. And that in itself kind of illustrates what I think is that so many East Asians are integrated enough into white culture that its easy not to notice. As u/manitobot said, you're cherry picking examples.

We see a lot of east asians in media that are often not referred to by their ethnicity, especially east asian women. Turn on any news channel and you will likely see at least one east asian anchor, almost never a south asian one. On TV shows and movies there may not be a ton of east asian leading roles (nor are there south asian ones) but you see a lot more east asians as part of the mix - e.g. part of some white person's friend circle.

As far as CEOs it is true there are a bunch of Indian CEOs in the US but its almost exclusively in technology which Indians are very focused on. That's a well known stereotype. I don't know of any stereotype of a field where east asians are concentrated, but instead are more known for being very academically focused in general.

One point I think is fair is that south asians are viewed as being integrated with other minorities and urban culture much more than east asians. I think you are right that part of it just from looks, I am often confused for being hispanic for instance. But one other thing I think is a reason is that South Asians (especially in urban areas) seem to embrace their culture more and not run away from it. I think in general minorities feel a connection to that even when it isn't their own culture, just the connection of being minorities in this country. Whereas I don't see this as much with east asians."
1181,2020-04-01 06:32:11,fso2lm,"You do make good points but most South Asians are confused for other South Asians 

So many actors are called Dev Patel because he is a name they know and it's ""easy to pronounce"" 

But outside of a few movies that kinda touched on some topics, I can't recall seeing a show on tv that represented my life.  Many South Asians wanted to avoid dating other South Asians because it perpetuates stereotypes of our culture as being closed ranks: all non-South Asians not welcome.  Because you never see a Westernized South Asian couple who are a good balance of traditional and modern.  Most of the shows and movies with a South Asian male lead often show South Asian women as being too traditional, not fun, and mostly dull.  

It wasn't until I was older that I realized I want to date someone from my own heritage, because I find Hindi to be a very romantic and poetic language, and most non-South Asians don't speak it.  I also find things about my upbringing and life that many people outside my heritage will not understand, and that makes dating difficult.  

I have found there are more East Asian movies in the mainstream.  Always Be My Maybe was awesome, and I found it relatable."

1184,2020-04-01 14:28:04,fso2lm,"This was a good eye opener to see the differences between south and east asians but i think the overall feeling that i personally notice with south asians is that we are always the butt of the joke. Most of the south asian american top stars came from making fun of our race out of comedy for the white man. This transfers to a smaller level like platforms like tik tok. Idk if you've seen it, but there is like general running jokes about indians. Toronto has a huge comedy instagram page called 6ixbuzz that literally posts things making fun of south asians with almost every post. All of these point to the idea that if theirs one race to make fun of its south asians and people have been so accustomed to it, they dont notice that they wouldnt say the same for another race."

I do agree that East Asian men are often portrayed as effeminate and are completely desexualized, and I feel like a similar thing happens for South Asian women‚Äî in the opposite direction. A lot of South Asian women are blessed with slightly more plentiful body and facial hair, and in the context of American life, we get portrayed as masculine and dirty unless we ‚Äúdo something‚Äù about it. And then, when we do in fact do something about it, we get reduced to ‚Äúexotic‚Äù stereotypes, similar to how East Asian women and girls are hypersexualized and fetishized by white men simply for existing.
We need to find solidarity as a community, especially in reclaiming our bodies, our sexualities, and, above all, our dignity. We don‚Äôt just exist for the consumption of our white peers, and I think both of our communities forget that all too often in trying to be accepted by our white peers."

1191,2020-04-01 20:24:00,fso2lm,"(Wall of text so scroll down for a TL;DR)

Here's the thing. When it comes to those not from America, I think that East Asians have it better than South Asians. As mentioned by other commentors, the perception of East Asian countries is growing rapidly: South Korea and Japan are seen as modern first-world countries, and even the perception of China is catching up\*. (Hell, I even have a Reddit profile picture of Ye Xiu from The King's Avatar, haha.) I think East Asians in a lot of ways are starting to get a bit of a ""cool foreigner"" perception the way that Europeans might get. (As an aside, ever since the Meiji Restoration, it's neat to read about how Japan put in a lot of effort to be seen as ""one of the boys"" among the European powers and even was somewhat successful.)

However, when it comes to being seen as ""integrated,"" I think that South Asians kind of have it better. Big caveat here, however, this applies much more to non-Muslim South Asians than Muslim South Asians, not least of all because there are at least some Hindus and Sikhs who will throw Muslims under the bus in a show of ""We're the *good* brown people, not like those evil Muslims!"" Because South Asia was colonized by the British, we've been exposed to Western Culture far longer, and more importantly, on the terms of the west, not our own. Yes, maybe Japan has had some cultural exchange with Europe, but they got to pick and choose what they liked while still getting to keep ""prestigious"" Japanese culture intact. I actually think that Muslims developed more of a resistance to this simply because there's an idea of a greater Muslim unity of the Ummah outside South Asia, and because even pre-9/11 there was this big looming fear up until WWI of the Ottomans threatening to overthrow the ""Christian"" West, so Muslims in the West felt a sort of kinship because of their shared struggles for their faith. Anyways, the point is that Indians are less out of their depth in Western countries, they at least know some English and have had more exposure to Western media. There's also the fact that India is an emerging market where most internet users use the internet in English, not Hindi or Tamil or Telugu. It's easier to localize streamed content when you don't *have to localize*. This makes appealing to Indian audiences more desirable than streaming to Chinese ones.

I think the imperialism and lack of another identity to ""turn back to"" is another role. This actually plays a pretty big role in how Indians approach life in America; we *have* to sink or swim here, we don't have a place to turn back to without sacrificing some level of comfort and lifestyle. I don't think Indians are necessarily more driven than other groups, but we have a little more at stake. It also helps that Indian work culture is more similar to Western work culture than East Asian work culture is, so we also have a better handle on how to channel that drive.

The above paragraph also kind of plays into the amount of self-hate that Indians seem to have compared to even other South Asians or East Asians. Anecdotally, my Pakistani and Bangladeshi friends don't seem to have as much of a complex about being Desi, they're at least at peace with their ethnicities if not even proud of them, or at the least proud to be Muslim. I mentioned earlier that Muslims have ""the Ummah"" to turn back to: the sense of community seems to be something my Muslim friends love about being Muslims. I notice they also don't take shit the way Indians do about being Indian; whereas my Indian friends might be more likely to laugh along with ""bobs and vagene"" type jokes and go ""yeah we are creepy and weird,"" my Muslim Desi friends will put their foot down when non Muslims joke about Muslims being terrorists or something. What's more, I've also noticed my Pakistani/Bangladeshi friends also tend to speak their mother languages much better than my Indian friends, and many of my Pakistani friends have mentioned their moms teaching them how to write in Urdu, something very few of my Indian friends have mentioned their parents teaching them about their native languages. In the same way, I've noticed my East Asian friends also don't have the same level of self-hate that Indians tend to have, they seem pretty proud of Korean and Japanese media and I notice that my Korean friends growing up all spoke pretty decent Korean. I think that the common thing with Desi Muslims and East Asians is the sense of being ""blocked out"" of U.S. society coupled with some greater thing they're proud of to turn back to I mentioned, while Indians only have the sense of being ""blocked out"" of U.S. society at large so they feel more motivated to keep trying to get in and break past the glass ceiling.

Incidentally, there is *one* East Asian group that I've noticed seems to have the ""self-hate"" that Indians do: Filipinos. I've heard a lot more discourse about many Fil-Ams not being taught their languages well, and seeing The Philippines as gross and backwards, the way many Indian-Americans do about India. I've had a Fil-Am friend mention to me just how common it is to pretend you ""forgot"" Tagalog when you go back to the Philippines and how you can only speak English now, and how his parents will insist they're Chinese over being Filipino even though they have both backgrounds. And anecdotally, I notice many Filipinos are more ""whitewashed"" than other East Asians, but also seem to have an easier time navigating US society. And surprise, surprise, The Philippines is a former colony of both Spain and the United States. Similar to Indians, they also seem to only have the sense of being ""blocked out"" while not having as much of the ""community they'd be proud to turn back to,"" and so like Indians, they also have the ""sink or swim"" attitude of trying to break through the glass ceiling rather than resting easier knowing they have someone/something to turn back to.

Tangentially, because many Japanese-Americans have been here for generations and don't meaningfully feel they can ""go back"" to Japan, they also seem to have more of an attitude of ""we make it in America or nowhere at all"" that Indians have, hence their greater representation in politics at least in California compared to Chinese or Koreans. It also helps that they're more acclimated to U.S. culture, seeing as they live here and all. (However, Japanese-Americans don't seem to have the self-hate that Indians do.)

***TL:DR*** \- While Asians of any kind feel ""blocked out"" of U.S. Society to an extent, some groups (many East Asians, as well as Desi Muslims) have a greater sense of identity and community/country they feel they can ""turn back"" to and others feel they don't have that (non-Muslim Indians, Filipinos), so they feel they have to make it in U.S. Society or bust. Also, the different ways our countries had contact with the West in the past. (Being colonized vs. having trade relations.)

\*It's not so cut-and-dry with China, though, especially with corona going around people are reverting to the racist stereotypes of China as a backwards thirdworld jungle with Chinese people being seen as savages who eat dogs or something."

1225,2020-04-01 14:26:12,fso2lm,"> but how do you explain all of those examples I gave in my post?

Simple. You're cherry-picking to avoid all the examples where East Asians are better off than South Asians. Take media representation for example.

Do South Asians have a Disney movie? Nope! Closest they can get is Aladdin, which is Middle Eastern, while East Asians have Mulan.

Do South Asians have their own Marvel movie? Nope! Closest they can get is one supporting role in a huge ensemble film, while East Asians are getting Shang-Chi.

Do South Asians have their own family sitcom on a major network? Nope! Closest they have now is a reality show on a cable network, while East Asians have FOTB, Dr. Ken, and even Margaret Cho's sitcom back in the 90s.

What's the most recent Western box office success with a majority South Asian cast (as in not just one SA star, but a full cast)? I believe you have to go back to Slumdog Millionaire, 12 years ago. South Asians are only allowed to succeed in Hollywood when they surround themselves with white people.

And it extends beyond media representation. It's great that there's more of an effort to track anti-Asian racism in the wake of coronavirus, but why didn't we see the same thing when South Asians were literally murdered as ""revenge"" for 9/11? We're supposedly part of the AAPI community but that community doesn't give a shit about anything until it affects East Asians."

>Why are there so few Asians among America‚Äôs business elite? And if a bamboo ceiling is to blame, why do South Asians break through more easily? These questions are the focus of a study by Jackson Lu of MIT Sloan School of Management and colleagues, who surveyed hundreds of senior executives and business-school students. They found that while discrimination exists, it is not destiny. South Asians endure greater racism than East Asians but still outperform even whites (if success is weighed against share of population). Their research also rules out lack of ambition: a greater share of Asians than whites strive for high-status jobs.

>That leaves culture. The researchers conclude that South Asians tend to be more assertive than East Asians in how they communicate at work, which fits Western notions of how a leader should behave. The same propensity for confident discourse featured in ‚ÄúThe Argumentative Indian‚Äù, a book by Amartya Sen, a Nobel-prizewinning economist.

1. Canada
2. UK
3. New Zealand
4. Australia
5. South Africa 
6. India

Obviously, if India changes economically to the point where it succeeds those nations, I would move their ASAP, but I don't see that happening."

>Why are there so few Asians among America‚Äôs business elite? And if a bamboo ceiling is to blame, why do South Asians break through more easily? These questions are the focus of a study by Jackson Lu of MIT Sloan School of Management and colleagues, who surveyed hundreds of senior executives and business-school students. They found that while discrimination exists, it is not destiny. South Asians endure greater racism than East Asians but still outperform even whites (if success is weighed against share of population). Their research also rules out lack of ambition: a greater share of Asians than whites strive for high-status jobs.

>That leaves culture. The researchers conclude that South Asians tend to be more assertive than East Asians in how they communicate at work, which fits Western notions of how a leader should behave. The same propensity for confident discourse featured in ‚ÄúThe Argumentative Indian‚Äù, a book by Amartya Sen, a Nobel-prizewinning economist. The researchers attribute East Asians‚Äô reticence to Confucian values of modesty and respect for hierarchy. Sometimes boldness and bombast are needed to break bamboo.‚ñ†"

It's strange to demand that American politicians, because of their ethnic origin,need to be promoting the current party in power in India. That would be the actual definition of 'useful idiots'. It's similar to white racists who don't view South Asians as truly part of American society. 

As far as I know, these politicians are mostly concerned with issues that impact all low income Americans, regardless of ethnicity. They may speak to issues outside of the US which all politicians do and is fine as we are interconnected. But, as it should be for members of congress, their main concern is the domestic issues affecting Americans, not to make sure that modi has good PR."
1268,2020-04-01 15:13:59,fso2lm,"He's cherry-picking there too. For example, OP claims that non-South Asian Americans aren't elected to major political office outside of Hawaii. Then how do you explain Tammy Duckworth, Ted Lieu, Judy Chu, Grace Meng, Mark Takano, and Andy Kim? There are more East/Southeast Asians currently serving in Congress than South Asians yet somehow Preet Bharara (a fired SDNY prosecutor) is proof that South Asians have more political power?

You're right that there's a lot to keep track of and my point is not that South Asians are worse off than East Asians. OP is just making a bad argument."
1269,2020-04-01 11:58:45,fso2lm,"Eh, but many do pick an English name and use that. My friends ShaoNan went by Tony, JinSu by Elvis, TianYi by Troy, YiFang by Chester to get around that issue. That might be more of a Hong Kong thing though, unsure."
1270,2020-04-01 20:35:41,fso2lm,"Also, historically China has less of a stick up its ass about names; there's this whole concept of how you used to have a name your parents gave you when you were born, a name you choose for yourself as an adult (and the childhood name can only be used to address you by your parents, or by the Emperor if you're being accused of a crime), and then a posthumous name used to refer to you after you've died. Add to that that the same name written in the same characters can sound different in different Chinese dialects. For example, the name ÁøíËøëÂπ≥ can be pronounced as X√≠ J√¨np√≠ng in Mandarin, Z√≠h J√Æn-b«ên in Wu, SiÃçp Khiun-ph√¨n in Hakka/Hokkien, and Jaahp Gahn-p√¨hng in Cantonese. When your name can be pronounced differently *within China*, and your culture already has a notion of choosing a new name for yourself in a new stage of life, I can imagine that a Chinese immigrant wouldn't be all that phased by having a new name in English when he practically already has a new name for any other dialect of Chinese.

Compare to India where traditionally your name is *your own*. It's based off of your star sign, it signifies your community, and there's a taboo about outright having the same name as an ancestor. Your name is seen as a very personal thing chosen *just for you*, and automatically tells others something about who you are and where you're from. I can imagine Indians have a harder time shaking off their name and replacing it with a new one, because there's more of an attitude of it being a sacred thing tied directly to who you are."

I still want to shoot the editor who made that choice and the director who let it stay. I don't edit professionally (yet) and have yet to take a single editing class, and even I can tell you that is the absolute worst fucking place for a cut. You never ever cut away from the action like that. You show what the viewer wants to see, and the viewer *absolutely* wants to see that choreo.

------------------------
From here on, my comment is quite long, so...sorry...

Reminds me of my favorite singer's NY concert which was edited for tv. The whole thing has abysmal editing, but a couple moments that stand out to me are:

A) After finishing a particular song that's quite special to him, and is probably one the songs his fans know him best for, he got choked up hearing and watching the audience cheer and chant his name. They fucking cut away from him when the cheering started and only showed a tiny bit of his jaw-clenched lip-biting smile where he was fighting back tears- and you can't even tell he's getting choked up because they only used a couple seconds-long shot where you don't get to really see those vital microexpressions. I can almost guarantee any viewer would love to see moments like that where a performer gets choked up, especially when they don't speak, but instead just take in the sights and sounds of the crowd and kind of get lost in the moment. It's an emotional thing and humans are emotional creatures.

B) There was a moment where he was on top of a moving setpiece, and carefully sliding/scooting down that setpiece to the stage. This was mid-song. His mic/in-ear transceiver pack fell off and landed on the stage, where it broke (it might have even gotten run over by the setpiece, but I've never been able to tell). Once he was safely on his own two feet on the stage, he looked for the transceiver, found it, picked up, realized it was broken, and kind of laughed in a ""of course it's broken"", defeated-yet-amused way. The editor showed him making his way down the setpiece, but cut away as he was looking for the transceiver and didn't cut back to him until he was walking around the stage after the laugh. As a result, it just kind of sounds like he ran out of breath for a moment and the viewer doesn't know what happened with the transceiver- he's just suddenly holding something in his hand, but you can't see what...and a little while later, he passes off the singing to the audience and runs backstage to get the transceiver issue fixed- which also comes across as a bit odd and jarring *because* the viewer hasn't gotten to see what happened with the transceiver. In other words, the viewer is deprived of information necessary to understand what's happening and why...this is another thing an editor should never ever do...I also just think the viewer would enjoy seeing him laugh because, again, we are emotional creatures.

In comparison, his Kiev concert has fantastic editing. This is an editor who understands how to tell a story and what to focus on when. I've only watched it once, so not a lot has stuck in my memory...but..........

There was one moment where he was getting to the end of a song and he sings a verse a capella. After the first couple lines, when there is a slight pause, an audience member shouted something out- something to the effect of ""my beloved"". He heard this, got embarrassed momentarily, then composed himself and continued on. Not only did this make the cut, but the editor used a closeup. This is something that the viewer wants to see and the editor *knows* it's what the viewer wants, and that a closeup is the best shot for this moment. This is good editing. This is what Masked Singer's editors and director *should* be doing but aren't.

Sometimes drama isn't the best thing to edit for- sometimes it's better to prioritize a memorable and emotional experience; *that's* what's worthwhile in the long run. *That's* what the viewer will remember and come back for, more than sensationalism and drama."

That said, I‚Äôm curious if this was supposed to be the ‚Äòstate of the team‚Äô event. I don‚Äôt know how it works for half season members, but every year I get a list of events I get to choose from and one of them is attending a state of the team address. Now I think it‚Äôs an in person event and it definitely wouldn‚Äôt have been scheduled during the playoffs, but I could see it being moved to a conference call at this time if it was supposed to take place after the lockdown but before the end of the regular season. 

I chose a post-game Shootaround and tour of the practice facility. I scheduled the latest available dates for both, which were March 13 and 14. If you remember, the season suspended on March 11 so I got totally screwed lol."

Also, Asian Americans are going to 14% of the population in 2065, with 38% being foreign born.  With that high a proportion of them being foreign born, we will likely continue to be seen as perpetual foreigners.  Those who are new and established will be divided as well.

Judge for yourself. 

In my opinion, globally, he has helped many smart Asians realize they shouldn't expect no WM to hold their hands against all the evils in this world. 

Regarding the issues the AA community has been facing, we've always tried to speak up. WM just never cared unless it served their agenda. Take the following:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/aznidentity/comments/9r5vd1/christopher\_matthews\_whose\_wife\_is\_asian\_tried\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/aznidentity/comments/9r5vd1/christopher_matthews_whose_wife_is_asian_tried_to/)

Don't think just because they call themselves liberals, doesn't mean they won't screw over AM. Punching a drunk should of just resulted in a simple slap on the wrist. Instead, because it was a AM punching a WM, it resulted in TWO FELONY CHARGES!?

I wouldn't call Trump a necessary evil. Under the Obama Administration, the value of the Russian ruble collapse due to American sanctions in retaliation against their annexation of Crimea - does that mean Obama is evil for conducting economic warfare against Russia? What about the high tariffs Obama placed on imports from China such as solar panels in the range of like 75% which never really got much news coverage? Makes the tariffs that Trump placed in the so called Trade War with China look like a joke.

To me, what is evil is the western MSM's anti-Asian agenda BS. Consuming it even to ""stay up to date on issues"" is like poison to the soul at times."
1406,2020-05-04 16:16:49,ga92yk,"Honestly, i like Trump. He makes white people especially a white man, look like an idiot."
1407,2020-04-30 03:45:40,ga92yk,I think there is something to be said that Trump is helping some people see the problems that have always existed in society. But he is also being presented as a false solution to legitimate problems that many people face.
1408,2020-04-29 23:58:33,ga92yk,"It is nice to think this might be true. Hopefully, more and more Asians become woke."
1409,2020-04-30 19:01:48,ga92yk,It seems more like the issue is that the AA community is sleeping more than Trump bringing these issues into light.
1410,2020-05-01 04:32:58,ga92yk,"Don't think having Trump is necessary for Asians to band together, but it sure is helping to accelerate it. If Biden gets elected, everything might go back to pre-Trump era, but hopefully what is happening now will have a positive impression on Asians. That we need to stick together not only during tough times but during good times as wewll."
1411,2020-04-29 23:29:12,ga92yk,"Not American but you could maybe say the same for the rise of right-wing populism in Europe. Blatant racism in the West has become a lot more common and socially accepted(by certain groups). It's quite scary how far the overton window has moved to the  right in Europe.

The question is whether right-wing populists are merely symptoms or also catalysts. If they're indirectly exposing problems that were already present that's fine. But I'm guessing that their presence also moves the overton window further right, which most certainly doesn't help us(or any other minority) at all."
1412,2020-04-30 04:13:23,ga92yk,"Trump has indeed been perpetuating blatant racist sentiments towards Asian communities that capture the attentions of many woke folks. And while your theory is interesting and certainly possible, it‚Äôs missing some very key components, for this to materialize positively for our community.

First, the Asian American image and PR have both been mismanaged so greatly, that it really limits the amount of sympathy, unity and ultimately support for our people. Whether that is in the form of real life solidarity or likes on posts regarding our issues. 

And I hate to say it, not as individuals, but as a collective, this is indeed what we deserve. 

For generations we failed to get involved in politics. We failed to engage in public discourse. We‚Äôve failed to dig our heels in on issues, big or small, joke or no joke, and instead we opted for the easy road, where we would rather ride coattails than engage in uncomfortable conflict. 

We failed to stand up for other communities that needed our help. In fact we often times advocated for the opposite. Think the ‚ÄúAnti-Affirmative Action‚Äù movement. Now, when woke folks think Asians, the most notable image they‚Äôll associate us with, is an Asian face holding a sign that says ‚ÄúI have a dream too‚Äù, suggesting that generations of Black slavery, oppression, violence and racism is the same as not getting into an Ivy League university. Be honest, is that someone you would defend over racism? Or is there a little bit of you that might believe this as karma? 

We as a culture (generally) promote against pursuing exploration in realms of music, arts, entertainment, sports etc. In my observations, these are not ‚Äúunimportant luxuries‚Äù, despite what we‚Äôve been taught by our upbringings. These are very important opportunities to humanize us. To show we are multifaceted human beings. To show we are here and not ‚Äúother‚Äù. Or simply opportunities to show our faces on movie screens, posters, magazines, so society has a chance to normalize an Asian face. To balance negative perceptions about us. 

But we don‚Äôt do that. And let‚Äôs not even talk about actually representing Asian America in media, some of us here won‚Äôt even back the ones that ARE trying to represent Asian America in media. Some of us won‚Äôt even spend the couple of bucks to buy a movie ticket for a movie that represents us in a positive light. Or go and sign into YouTube and like a video that shows Asian men in a masculine light. Like them or not, go buy every piece of Cho/ Simu/ Dae Kim media out there, it‚Äôs an investment in yourself.

As a collective we rarely attempted to reached across the isle. To extend the opportunity for people to understand us. To show we are also contributing members of this society. Many of us did, but I promise you, more of us didn‚Äôt bother.

So truthfully, if any, I can‚Äôt see too many of the woke community helping us.

Which ultimately brings us to the other key component of this difficult dynamic. Often times, we won‚Äôt even help ourselves.

Even if the woke wave pushes us along the ride a little bit, we as a community must still do majority of the paddling. Unfortunately, I simply don‚Äôt see this happening. I can‚Äôt count how many times I‚Äôve had to watch a non Asian face speak up for Asian issues. I can‚Äôt count how many times I‚Äôve watched people do us favours and defend us. As if we‚Äôre clueless sheep that are incapable of protecting our own. Quite frankly, it‚Äôs getting embarrassing.

I can reasonably be absolutely sure of one thing on this side of the world, you need to teach people how you want to be treated. Nothing is expected. Boundaries are uncomfortable but they are absolutely essential. If you don‚Äôt set them or simply fold when boundaries are crossed, it only shows that you‚Äôre deserving of poor treatment. Respect on this side of the world, is not granted, it‚Äôs fought for. 

To this regard, honestly ask ourselves have we been doing so? And more importantly, will we start to do so? I‚Äôm still not confident that we as a collective are understanding that ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt want no trouble‚Äù also means ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt want no respect‚Äù. What we say we want, will not be achieved without hurt, humiliation and hardship. There will never be one without the other and I‚Äôm simply not convinced most of our community is ready for that.

In my lifetime, I can‚Äôt tell you how many ‚Äúfriends‚Äù I‚Äôve dropped in my life for them not respecting my boundaries. I can‚Äôt tell you how many of them called me later on in life apologizing. I can‚Äôt tell you how many yelling matches I‚Äôve been in at a bar over someone‚Äôs shitty words. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve had to have extremely extremely uncomfortable conversations with people about how I need them to behave around me. I can‚Äôt count how many times I‚Äôve been in physical altercations in situations that warranted it.

And while most people that know me, may not like me, they most certainly respect me. Unfortunately, I also can‚Äôt count how many times I‚Äôve been told, that because of my behaviour, that I‚Äôm ‚Äúnot the usual kind of Asian guy‚Äù. And the truth is, until my way of operating is no longer an anomaly for us, until the time that I get ‚Äúyou‚Äôre such a typical kind of Asian guy‚Äù for being confrontational, for being ready to dig my heels in, for being able to stand tall and defend his territory, this whole thing will just be yet another fight that we had someone fight for us. 

So while I agree, Trump has brought light to a blind spot, it‚Äôs entirely dependent on what we decide to do with this that will make the difference. Unfortunately, I‚Äôm not putting bets on any of this. Most of us will hide. Most of us will trust that someone else will take care of it. Most of us are ok with living in the shade of other races."
1413,2020-05-01 21:45:49,ga92yk,"Yeah, I‚Äôm an 80s baby, I feel you OP, it was a struggle growing up.

As to Trump, he exposed the contradictions in American society and laid them bare in a way that‚Äôs greatly accelerated the historical process.  Whether we still need to put up with him or not is up for debate."
1414,2020-04-29 21:31:08,ga92yk,"Correlation does not imply causation.

Just because people are becoming more woke to the plight of the Asian man around the time he got elected, doesn't mean that he had anything to do with it. Latest example I can think of was his insistence on calling CoViD-19 the ""Chinese Virus"", even though he stopped now."

1416,2020-05-01 01:14:05,ga92yk,"Nuh this is just wishful thinking. Fact is the racism against Asians has gotten higher due to conservatives. The solution, in my opinion, is to isolate yourself from society as much as possible and have a large chunk of your wealth in bitcoin where government cannot touch it (eg there may be internment camps and they can seize your wealth) and you can travel to Asia and live there if need be.

Asians I have noticed tend to engage in wishful thinking and sucking up eg I see many Asians trying to bash China in order to show the whites ""I am on your side!"" You got to protect yourself. Isolate yourself from society and buy more bitcoin."

1423,2020-04-30 23:16:22,ga92yk,"Can't find any news on it despite how the media ran that same article for like a month after it happened. The WM managed to scam close to $70k off of a GoFundMe set up for his recovery (who the fuck actually needs that much treatment recovering from a punch?) which is probably set up by his own doctors so he can sue Jiacheng Fang. Maybe a settlement was made or Jiacheng Fang was unjustly sentenced.

I'm not advocating violence, but if Jiacheng Fang was smart, he'd of hired a contract killer and had it taken care of. 30yrs in prison vs $30k is not really a hard decision to make. With the amount of Black gangs in CA, I don't believe it would be too difficult to find someone willing to help an AM seek justice against a WM."

1464,2020-04-27 16:43:36,g8vodu,June 5th is a Friday and that‚Äôs when they release new podcast episodes so there may be something to it
1465,2020-04-28 04:41:45,g8vodu,What was the biggest storyline or scene where it was just Chang and Troy? I can‚Äôt remember too many.
1466,2020-04-28 05:35:10,g8vodu,"plot twist, chang is the real main character"
1467,2020-04-28 06:12:46,g8vodu,Could this be the #andamovie we‚Äôve been looking for?

1470,2020-04-27 07:43:42,g8vodu, Maybe June 5th is the start of production?!
1471,2020-04-27 11:23:46,g8vodu,You think Glover would do a podcast with Chevy?

1488,2020-04-27 14:18:30,g8vodu,"He said something like ""You're only funny because you're black"" to Glover. They'll probably be in separate podcasts."
1489,2020-04-27 18:03:40,g8vodu,"I‚Äôve read a lot of conflicting things about their relationship tbh. 

Obviously it‚Äôs well-known that Chevy is a dick off-screen, and took some shots at Donald, but I‚Äôve also read that the two of them had great chemistry and he was chevy‚Äôs personal favorite to work with"
1490,2020-04-27 15:53:48,g8vodu,"They had a huge falling out due to Chase's racism. He even dropped the n-bomb while arguing with Dan Harmon.

I don't think we'll see Chevy in a Community context (movie, podcast, panel event, etc) ever again."
1491,2020-04-27 17:19:00,g8vodu,ummm
1492,2020-04-27 08:54:02,g8vodu,"Well, Community ended less than 5 years ago. 
It could be nothing, but there‚Äôs been a lot of movement in the past month after years of silence."
1493,2020-04-27 14:48:05,g8vodu,Oh fuck! Not here again!
1494,2020-04-27 15:30:07,g8vodu,I read somewhere that Glover forgave Chase for the comment but I don‚Äôt remember where
1495,2020-04-27 17:24:26,g8vodu,"He called Don Glo the N word lol I remember reading Chevy was getting mad his character was just a dumb racist and so I think he ‚Äúironically‚Äù called Donald the N word, in like a, ‚Äúoh yeah I‚Äôm so racist? Fine, look I‚Äôll say something racist‚Äù kind of bitter sarcastic way, you know. Where you say or do something awful to bring attention to it‚Äôs very awfulness? Dan does that shit all the time, even candidly on Harmontown. It doesn‚Äôt sound like it makes sense but it really does if you are a very sarcastic and hyper self aware person"
1496,2020-04-27 17:30:59,g8vodu,"Some of that was Chase being offended by Pierce being the butt of old and racism jokes.

My recollection is he blew up a few times over Pierce being racist and was basically like, ""Why don't you just go ahead and have me say 'n*****'!? 'N******! N******! There?! That's what you want, isn't it?""

The funny thing is... The characters were basically all aspects of Harmon's personality except maybe Shirley.

So Pierce being racist was about Harmon seeing himself as an old man with unreconstructed attitudes and a head full of stereotypes from pop culture. Britta was an exaggerated spoof of Harmon's politics.

I think where Pierce and Shirley got the short end of things was that the characters were basically all based on Harmon's friends mixed with Harmon's flaws and he named most of them after the actor he had in mind.

So Britta Philips was Britta Perry. Abed Gheith was Abed Nadir. Jeff Winger was Jeff Davis plus Bill Murray from Stripes plus Dan Harmon, who saw himself as a disgraced former hotshot wordsmith. The Dean was probably meant for Rob Schrab who's bald and looks a bit like Moby and does drag in his comedy. Shirley and Troy were attempts to broaden the show. Troy was meant to be a white redneck, kind of a jock version of Woody from Cheers.

Pierce was forced on them by the network who said they needed a star. They pushed for Fred Willard and got Chevy Chase because he was a bigger star. Incidentally, I think Fred Willard would have been funnier in the role, more erudite moist towlette executive racist, less faking heart attacks.

A lot of the Pierce character was about satire and I don't think Chevy was wry enough for that so it came off as sloppy racism which made Chevy feel like the butt of every joke. Whereas I think Willard would have approached it as total 80s hedge fund wanna be, a type to make fun of. And Chevy always played himself so making him say racist things made him feel like he was being called racist, which resulted in him blowing up and being more racist in ad libs."
1497,2020-04-27 11:43:58,g8vodu,Hopefully the success on Netflix is encouraging whoever would fund a movie.
1498,2020-04-27 17:21:09,g8vodu,"With just especially how political and socially active Glover is within the black community, I can‚Äôt see him willingly going on a podcast with Chase like this after he called him the n-word. I just don‚Äôt see Glover choosing to do something like that especially in the public and how it‚Äôll look, like you can just call someone like Donald the n-word and he won‚Äôt care, I just think Glover is hyper aware of precedents and shit like that, he‚Äôs super smart. Even if he has forgave him because that‚Äôs the mature thing to do, I doubt he‚Äôll want to work with or associate with Chevy like that again"
1499,2020-04-27 14:49:11,g8vodu,"There is also a theory going around that there were already talks about it before its release on Netflix (apparently Alison Brie wrote on her AMA in February that she ""had received a call"" about it), and Netflix bought the distribution rights in order to produce the movie and at the same time gauge the shows popularity. Could be just wishfull thinking, but here's hoping."
1500,2020-04-27 14:17:15,g8vodu,Netflix will fund it.
1501,2020-04-27 20:30:44,g8vodu,"Slight clarification: he didn't call him the n-word. He was frustrated with Pierce's development and said (to Harmon, I believe) that 'youre eventually gonna have him say the n-word', but Chevy did actually say the word"
1502,2020-04-28 03:09:28,g8vodu,"I‚Äôll keep rewatching everyday, just in case it helps. Just doing my part for one of my favorite little tv shows!"
1503,2020-04-28 05:12:59,g8vodu,Really is there a source to that? From what I read it made it sound like he said that while actually saying the n-word. Was it in a harmoncast or something?
1504,2020-04-28 05:42:53,g8vodu,I think you might have misread my comment. I said that Chevy did actually say it
1505,2020-04-28 08:43:57,g8vodu,Oh lmao sorry for some reason I read that as you saying he actually said ‚Äún word‚Äù

1554,2020-04-26 08:07:08,g7zdpa,That means that Alison Brie (Annie) was actually surprised.
1555,2020-04-26 00:14:59,g7zdpa,Stop fixiating on it
1556,2020-04-26 05:05:35,g7zdpa,Ok I obviously need to rewatch 30 rock lol.
1557,2020-04-26 03:16:18,g7zdpa,"Conversely, when Harmon was on Game Grumps he talked about how it took him a while to figure out how to work with Jeong, because at first he was super pissed that he was fucking up all his setups, then eventually he realized you can't try to write him jokes, you just let him loose on a scene and let him do his thing. Obviously I'm sure there was sort of a balance over time, but that explains so much about how Chang's wackiness develops throughout the show"
1558,2020-04-26 03:38:17,g7zdpa,"I could‚Äôve swore I saw an article saying that Harmon used to write into his scripts ‚ÄúLet Donald be Donald‚Äù, so it seems he got more ok with improv as the show went on"
1559,2020-04-26 02:55:14,g7zdpa,"Lol guess Dan Harmon lightened up when it came to improv, considering Rick and Morty. Although maybe with animation it‚Äôs different."
1560,2020-04-26 03:17:49,g7zdpa,So is it all improv in the final version or is it the Harmon script?
1561,2020-04-26 03:15:09,g7zdpa,"Wait - I‚Äôm curious why he‚Äôd be furious?? Is it because, as a writer, he‚Äôs supposed to be the funny one? Or is this just something that‚Äôs like a well-known fact in the business of television?"
1562,2020-04-26 11:15:37,g7zdpa,You could say Dan Harmon was... changry!
1563,2020-04-26 04:02:59,g7zdpa,"I have no idea how the process works, but what's interesting to me with this comment is how even though Harmon was furious, it's still the cut they used for the scene. So either Harmon saw it first and ultimately thought it was still usable or he wasn't made aware of it until after the scene was finalized."
1564,2020-04-26 07:38:11,g7zdpa,You mean the guy who played Michael Scott's improv teacher wanted to improvise? Something ain't adding up.
1565,2020-04-26 06:32:03,g7zdpa,Ya bit!

1581,2020-04-26 06:41:28,g7zdpa,In the DVD commentaries he says the same thing about Donald. Once they realized how amazing he was at improv they would sometimes write notes in the script for places for him to just improv multiple different takes and pick the funniest one because they figured out he was oftentimes funnier than anything the writers could come up with.
1582,2020-04-26 05:36:58,g7zdpa,In the last two seasons all his lines feel super forced compared to the first three. But that might have more to do with the direction they went with his character than the amount of freedom they gave him.

1585,2020-04-26 05:26:37,g7zdpa,"I think someone says during the DVD-commentary for the Halloween episode during the second season  that when the gang runs from the zombies and Troy screams 'I just punched a lady bug."" Donald screamed something different every time since the script just said ""Troy says something funny.""."
1586,2020-04-26 09:45:13,g7zdpa,"Fun fact: Bill Lawrence said the same about Neil Flynn playing the janitor on Scrubs. They would sometimes just write in the script ""whatever Neil says"" for his lines."
1587,2020-04-26 06:52:46,g7zdpa,"Yeah Donald was told to improvise a ton starting in season 1. You can see alternate versions of a lot of his lines in the Season 1 outtakes.

Everybody would watch eachothers scenes and then add to the script according to a cast interview I saw. Mainly during rehearsals though. I saw an interview this week where Alison talks about improvisation she did too."
1588,2020-04-26 03:19:33,g7zdpa,"I mean, Justin Roiland is the co-creator/writer for the show, theoretically any ad-libbed scene of Rick and Morty isnt so much improve as an impromptu re-write."

1591,2020-04-26 03:33:15,g7zdpa,"My guess is because theres possible set up to jokes later in the ep or even the particular scene which can throw off other charecter lines and may force other actors to improv too. He wouldnt be mad that ken may say or do something that is funnier than what was written but he might have to rewrite things for parts or even the whole episode. This kind of thing might fly with say Curb Your Enthuisiasm because thats just how they do the show, but dans scripts are probably pretty tight. Just my guess"
1592,2020-04-26 03:40:10,g7zdpa,"Contrary to popular belief, most scripted shows have very little to no improv. There's a reason the writer's room exists. They tend to be funnier than the actors. Donald Glover notwithstanding."
1593,2020-04-26 03:45:55,g7zdpa,"It's a disservice to the writers, not because they're supposed to be the funny one, but because adlibbing without permission could be seen as disrespectful to the original intent of the script. Of course, if it's good they'll end up using it."
1594,2020-04-26 04:42:00,g7zdpa,"A lot of writers really don't like improv, cause I guess they took all this time to write these jokes, and create this story, and this guy is just saying shit. I am an improv teacher, and improv is super valuable cause it makes things feel organic and improves the writing and vibe"
1595,2020-04-26 06:49:37,g7zdpa,I'd imagine you're on pins and needles not wanting your show to fail when you're only on episode 2. Any deviating from the plan could be terrifying.

1615,2020-04-26 06:47:47,g7zdpa,"They point out lots of instances in the commentaries where Donald has a hilarious line and it turns out it was improv.

Iirc, the end tag leaving the voicemails for Abed was one, the ""it's like grumpy old men but not hilarious"" was another that was improv'd several ways, and the Cookie Crisp mascot being a burglar and not a wizard line was improv'd and Dan Harmon kept it. Harmon is older and didn't know they'd changed the mascot.

Tons of others I can't remember right now too."
1616,2020-04-26 18:14:38,g7zdpa,"This should have a million upvotes. Community owes a LOT to Scrubs - more than the harmonites want to admit. The quick cuts, the mental fantasies, the UNREAL weaving of A, B, AND C plots, the Bromance. He really went to school on it, and I'm glad he did.

I LOVE them both, but Community is definitely a branch off the Scrubs evolutionary tree. A wonderful strange mutation from the Harmon ass-teroid.

Because, let's face it. Dan crams ass into every scene of everything he's ever produced. It gets old.

You know, when you rewatch Scrubs, The Janitor is only character that is totally 'himself' from the get-go. Amazing work by Neil.

Jim Rash has been doing improv forever (Groundlings) - he was awesome in Reno 911 and you know that was all improv, so I wonder how much of his stuff was improv."
1617,2020-04-26 03:32:28,g7zdpa,"Yeah. And they‚Äôre preplanned as well. I‚Äôm pretty sure many of the scenes have rough outlines for Justin to follow, and he‚Äôs expected to ad-lib."

1620,2020-04-26 05:07:56,g7zdpa,Why? What do you mean?
1621,2020-04-26 05:39:22,g7zdpa,Basically this. There might be a long run setup where they refer to a line of dialogue later on which becomes a non sequitur if they're not sticking to the script.
1622,2020-04-26 07:02:25,g7zdpa,"Well, there's also the fact that it is well known that Harmon was notoriously hard to work with and was a real piece of work. I could believe that it was an egocentric thing"
1623,2020-04-26 04:07:17,g7zdpa,And part of what made Donald so great at it was he had experience as a writer. He was a writer for 30 Rock before he joined the cast of Community.
1624,2020-04-26 04:01:42,g7zdpa,"Seems like the room to improvise is written into the script mostly. I remember seeing an interview with the cast where they said the script would just say ""troy says something funny"" and they give Donald the freedom to make something up.

1626,2020-04-26 14:41:58,g7zdpa,"SNL is a fun case study in this balance shifting back and forth over time. I'm reading the Live From New York book right now and they delve into the writer/performer relationships and how at a certain point you basically had to write for yourself if you wanted any chance of making it into an episode, vs a more traditional setup earlier in the show's history."
1627,2020-04-26 04:11:42,g7zdpa,Makes total sense. Thanks for that!
1628,2020-04-26 05:34:35,g7zdpa,"Improv can sometimes help writers write, but most of the time the writers are gonna come up with funnier jokes than the actors"
1629,2020-04-26 04:59:43,g7zdpa,So do you think writers should leave room in the script for improv or do you think it‚Äôs more about writers being less-frustrated with actors riffing??

But Dan Harmon took things a little more seriously I think, I read somewhere that on community, the cast had extremely long work hours cause Dan made them repeat the same scene for hours at a time until they got it exactly right."

All jokes aside I like Dan Harmon. I used to listen to his podcast all the time. But then I went to a live show and the fans there are like a fucking cult.

1652,2020-04-26 06:52:33,g7zdpa,It wasn't originally. Harmon said in the commentaries they really tried to stay on script in the first few episodes until they started to realize how good some of the cast is at improv.
1653,2020-04-26 04:14:26,g7zdpa,"No problem!

""Writers sit in a room for hours --- and there are 10 of them and they all went to Harvard --- and they argue endlessly about what jokes to end a scene on, but a good portion of the ending lines to scenes in Community would be ones that Donald would just riff on the spot. I remember there was a transitional point where we literally started writing in the script, 'And then Donald says something funny.""

That's the quote we use on KultureMedia- covering how Hollywood uses narratives to racially subordinate Asians in America.  

One thing I will warn you.  Hollywood is not just ""another industry"".  There is a shadow government that actually rules America and the West; their power is enormous, and H'wood is tied in with that network.  These people are practically above the law.  Confronting their mind control over the people will require enormous resources and conviction.  All this while the average clown, who fails to understand psychology or even the power structure within his own country, assumes this is all ""no big deal""."
1714,2020-04-24 05:34:54,g71qhj,"As you said, it's a grossly oversimplified solution.

The government is corrupt. Nationalizing HW won't change that. HW already follows government directives."
1715,2020-04-24 14:47:17,g71qhj,"You make great points.  Trying to work within Hollywood and it‚Äôs institution is looking to me to be futile.  It‚Äôs like getting your foot in the door at a company, doing well in the lower rungs but only being promoted so far.  Hollywood, like in corporations, they will not promote strong alpha Asian American male leaders (eg leading male actors), in fact the opposite will happen, they will make any excuse to either keep you down or lay you off the first chance they get.  In addition, they love the subservient ‚Äúyes man‚Äù Asian American male  employee who won‚Äôt complain, work after hours, are highly productive, suck up to the boss and be the fall guy.  Hollywood works it‚Äôs magic using images and political narratives and there is a disturbing role Asian men get to play to soothe and promote other‚Äôs shallow and fragile egos.  They are highly adept at psychological and subconscious superiority generation of their own over Asian men via images and narratives and by default Asian American men are affected conversely."

We go through tiny waves of representation (when I was growing up, it was Mortal Kombat, Jet Li, and Margaret Cho), which does exactly nil to improve our position.  I‚Äôm 34, I‚Äôve seen this sort of ‚Äúrepresentation politics‚Äù pattern over and over and over again.  It wasn‚Äôt really cemented until I actually started working in Hollywood, how clueless people are to think they can change it in its current incarnation.  You can‚Äôt.  It‚Äôs designed to serve imperial interests, and Asia has explicitly been a target for decades, esp during the Cold War and likely for a long period of time after COVID.

And you‚Äôre right, the government is corrupt.  Hence, the need for communist revolution."
1721,2020-04-24 06:02:47,g71qhj,"It's not the government that's behind H'wood today that's causing the problem.  It's a global financial elite that claims to be non-white (when its convenient) but actually promotes white supremacy because they along with anglos are white and have a duopoly worldwide.  

The government is at least subject to public pressure via voting.  The majority will soon be minorities."

That's already happening thanks to the Internet. Faith in mainstream journalism is at an all time low (Faith in corporations in general is low because they downsize whenever it suits their short term financials).

People are seeking content via YouTube or other mediums because they don't like how manufactured and fake MSM is."

>Where we disagree, is that the use of the bourgeois electoral system, which is run and maintained by those same bad actors, will somehow provide an outlet for change.

Amusing.  This MoreTankie troll posts that H'wood should be nationalized, then writes a screed why nationalizing it would in fact bring no benefit. 

Not well thought through in the slightest.  Beyond a litany of left-wing complaints about supposed ""suppression"", what you have is garden-variety defeatism - not just against Rules, but also intellectually lazy - government contracts have quotas for affirmative action in a way the private sector does not.  If ""white supremacy"" controlled every aspect of the government and enforced it, that wouldn't exist.  

Should have checked post history before I responded, my mistake.   Never feed trolls...."

Several months later when *Permanent Vacation* came out, she couldn't wait to let me know about this awesome album by this new band that she had ""discovered"" before anyone else.

She didnt believe me when I told her that this was their ninth album and they had been around since before she was born.  Then I blew her mind when I dug all of my old albums and started playing them for her."

Our emotionally tough parenting also gives us especially thick skin and a huge reservoir of anger and determination to prove ourselves. Where is this represented in media? I see none of it.

It‚Äôs more grounded than the show was in seasons 2 or 3, but it still has the same blend of humor, cleverness, and heart that made the first few seasons so unique. Season 6 is the most consistently enjoyable  season for me, with several great episodes, even more good ones, and only a couple of mediocre ones. I‚Äôm not entirely sure what you mean about the format, but I really appreciate the longer runtimes since they give the characters more time to shine and provide more freedom with regards to storytelling.

1809,2020-06-13 12:14:23,h84mc1,"Ha, ha, I'm a big fan of sageuks, not so much of modern dramas. But in Goblin, the MacGuffin in the early episodes could be the ""Goblin Bride"" that Kim Shim is looking for.

In IRIS, the MacGuffin could be the nuclear device that Hyun-joon, Seung-hee, Sun-hwa, and the NSS are looking for. That firefight with the terrorists in >!Ep. 17 on the streets!< over the nuclear device is superb! 

In CLOY, a minor MacGuffin could be the watch that belonged to Ri Jeong-hyuk's brother. The watch went from Ri Jeong-hyuk to his brother, to Man Bok, to the pawnshop owner, to Se-ri, back to Man Bok, and finally back to Ri Jeong-hyuk.

But it can also be argued that Se-ri herself is a ""character"" MacGuffin, being fought over by her family, Ri Jeong-hyuk, Cho Cheol Gang, etc."

1821,2020-06-11 17:54:18,h13bkb,changnesia was pretty stupid but I thought him being a villain in season 3 was really funny
1822,2020-06-11 17:23:10,h13bkb,"Could be. Idk I feel like the season 1 finale was so good and so Chang, but then they realized that they kinda fucked up by taking him out of his role and had tome come up with another one that was rushed."
1823,2020-06-11 18:26:31,h13bkb,didn‚Äôt they literally do that in Intro to Recycled Cinema
1824,2020-06-11 18:56:00,h13bkb,"Actually I think they said originally Ken Jeong was supposed to just be a recurring guest star like John Oliver, and then when the *Hangover* blew up, they offered him the full time role.  So he was already written on based on that."
1825,2020-06-11 18:47:15,h13bkb,Pretty certain they all just really loved Ken and wanted him to stick around despite having no real plans for his character.
1826,2020-06-11 18:11:57,h13bkb,but hangover was already out during season 1... i dnt think that was the thought process at all.
1827,2020-06-12 05:32:07,h13bkb,"Senor Chang was the only Chang I liked. He was alright at the beginning of season 3 too but he was just a waste of a character at most other times. 

I feel the same way about his continued and increased role in the show. I know he's well-liked and they wanted to keep him but the writing of his character felt like he was being forced into the show. It just didn't feel natural after awhile."
1828,2020-06-11 20:33:54,h13bkb,I love the character regression and how he slowly becomes a villain by season 3 so I disagree
1829,2020-06-11 17:45:21,h13bkb,More like they changhorned Ken Jeong into a bigger role.
1830,2020-06-11 17:26:05,h13bkb,Well obviously season 4 suffered but for different reasons. But I agree that in S3 he was not very good and the episodes without/very little of him were better. However I think season 2 Chang is hilarious and is definitely the best season for him.
1831,2020-06-12 08:12:17,h13bkb,"There were a few characters who I feel peaked in Season 1, Chang being one of them.

Pierce, Chang and Duncan were all in their ideal roles in Season 1.

Chang got to be too ridiculous, and the wackiness really hurt the back half of season 3 and it was one of the biggest problems with season 4. 5 and 6 he just sort of felt like a character they didn't know what to do with."

1833,2020-06-11 19:51:46,h13bkb,Dang I never realized that! This show out-metas itself sometimes.
1834,2020-06-12 20:11:38,h13bkb,"I heard that John Oliver was actually intended to fulfill the main teacher role that chang ended up filling (which is why he was so prominent in the pilot), but then he ended up not wanting to commit to the role at that frequency. This plus Ken Jeong's explosion of popularity resulted in the show pivoting to Chang."
1835,2020-06-11 21:04:38,h13bkb,And the writing and overall tone was affected by it. Wouldn't you say?

One thing that's striking about this type of analysis is that it's done through the lens of popular media/video content.

To be a part of the crowd that doesn't have to uphold the veneer of respectability and decorum‚Äîmeans the thinkers can entertain all ideas and thought without the fear of suppression. It's a forum where the seed of conversation and dialogue is not crushed at its inception.

Imagine if I even thought about what or how the mods or people at /r/Asianamerican would react to my writing while writing it. I can imagine their reactions before I even wrote a word.

>""OH! how can you even compare the two experiences! You're not Black!""""Check your privilege!

That last part may have truth but only because it hints at something really vital about this forum that is lacking in /r/asianamerican. It lets me actively write out and actually figure out what are my underlining feelings and subconscious thoughts about an issue and formulate it into conscious awareness.

Instead of forcing myself to self-censor and live with these conflicting feeling of always being on the cusp of realizing a vital truth i need to speak out but not being able open my mouth‚Äîthereby leaving it nameless.

(Admittedly though it's difficult to talk about societal forces without making it seem like individual choices are impossible to take into consideration)

A conversation about AF and AM is important because in some ways America is an even more patriarchal society than  Asia. From the inception of America there's been no female president or central female leadership, despite its modern motto of ""championing equality"".

But South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Japan and etc. can all look into their past and history to find examples of female leadership‚Äîwhether that be recent elected officials or historical monarchies.

The duplicity that arises is that whiteness is considered normative while other ""races"" are not. Vis-a-vie colonization, imperialism and white savior tropes, foreign females are more prized than males ‚Äîhence the backlash against America's recent Korean Pop obsession by your ""traditional white American guys"" since it elevates Korean men over women (as well as placing Korean groups & community in a position of admiration).

Yet in the domestic sphere, if you feel the burden of racial oppression & prejudice all the time‚Äît[hen even a modicum of relief will feel like liberation](https://youtu.be/d37DZogot1w). It then becomes easier to conflate oppression of the other member due to their lack of willingness to be complacency or their ""individual failings"" if it means maintaining the facsimile of liberation.

Like the ""house slave"" blames the ""field slave"" for their crudeness and inability to grow. While the ""field slave"" blames the ""house slave"" for their weakness and betrayal.

Maybe blacks should examine the anti-Asian racism that is rampant in their community before expecting Asians to care about their problems.

THIS! Exactly what I've been thinking. Even saw a prominent mixed asian youtuber talking about 'asians don't speak up'. The support from asians in the west for black lives highly outweighs the ones against it or passive about it.

The only one that provided any real support to the Asian community was [RZA](https://www.instagram.com/p/B-II5gBgvzJ/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet). 

Where was the social outcry from the black community after three black teens assault, while on FB live, and laughing and daring each other to kick and old Asian lady in the face. Does nobody understand that this was inhumane? 

[Three Black Teens Assault Asian Grandma](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.buzzfeednews.com/amphtml/briannasacks/teens-minnesota-kicking-asian-american-woman) 

Where was the public outcry and condemnation from the Black Community?"
1898,2020-06-02 09:00:49,gv0epy,"Yes they are half Palestinian (which isn‚Äôt necessary east or sea Asian, but I still count as Asian)"
1899,2020-06-02 09:57:00,gv0epy,"Yea LA riots were far worse than what's happening today.  The city looked like a war zone fires as far as you can see..  Looting is looting....just a reflection on people's priorities.  Steal nice shit , sell , get money. Pay bills,  eat food. I for one will do my part and look at offerup and craigslist for good deals... Morals?  pfft , the same white morals used to justify dehumanizing black people and other people of color.  I won't take any of this shit seriously until the black people in Houston riot and loot.  That's when you know shit got real."
1900,2020-06-02 16:48:12,gv0epy,"Pretty sure that consisted of black/African American male sexpats looking to go after Korean girls, just like these days you have a shit ton of Koreaphiles and japanophile white/black American males who go for ""language exchange"", or who love to visit Thailand, or who sign up in the military and all choose to want to be stationed in Japan or Korea. You know full well WTF white, black, and latino males **only** have in mind when it comes to Asians.  


Asian men as a whole, and especially in Asia need to be less KKK UCKED"
1901,2020-06-02 14:06:52,gv0epy,"Because ""bridging the gap"" is a platitude offered in bad faith to justify letting black criminals continue to victimize Asians."
1902,2020-06-02 06:35:35,gv0epy,"If you are serious about doing this make sure you are:

- Proficient in the language. Speaking casual conversations with your parents won't prepare you for actually living in the country and surviving. Make sure you have a solid understanding of the language - reading, writing and speaking.
- Have a job lined up or have a guaranteed source of income. Just trying to wing it post move will be a terrible decision. Don't do this.
- Have a place to stay. Housing shortage is real problem in many Asian countries, particularly in the metro areas.

If you have all these three lined up then moving sooner than later might be prudent. The longer you wait, the less likely you will go through with it."
1903,2020-06-02 10:02:29,gv0epy,Don't. You need to stay there and fight.
1904,2020-06-02 08:54:55,gv0epy,Go to Lipstickalley. They always post threads on Asians getting discrimination and they laugh about it.
1905,2020-06-02 07:01:01,gv0epy,Hell man...what about sexpats? They go to asia and become lifers overthere. Oh wait...being white kind of gives them some special treatment even in asia.
1906,2020-06-02 11:07:32,gv0epy,Isn‚Äôt that a forum site?
1907,2020-06-02 07:13:06,gv0epy,"They usually stick around for a year or two until the novelty of living in Asia wears off and they miss the comforts of being home. Or when they realize they are just babysitting jesters that parents pay to keep their kids occupied for a few hours everyday. At some point they all realize they wasted their time doing jackshit while their life back home has moved on without them. The ones who remain become extremely bitter and resentful that they are trapped, since they have no other skills to earn a living."
1908,2020-06-02 14:14:51,gv0epy,"Yes, mostly by black women."
1909,2020-06-02 09:54:39,gv0epy,Many get disability/social security payments from their origin country.  That's how they can survive with out any real skill.

1932,2020-05-30 02:49:26,gt6lou,"Watch The Darkest Timeline Podcast. Ken and Joel McHale host it and a lot of it is about their experience on Community.

When I saw him perform that Standup live, he did a Q&A and I asked about his favorite personal story from Community and he told the story about how Dan Harmon took a frustrated email from Ken about his character's arc at the time (in Season 5) and how Dan pretty much wrote verbatim what he said into an episode (Chang's speach in the Bear Down for Midterms episode). He said how awesome that was of Dan to do and how grateful he was for that scene to be included."

The accent is problematic, and Jimmy did address this- he said if someone‚Äôs gonna play a guy with an accent, he could at least make the guy seem human (and not a caricature). I still hate the character, but I give Jimmy a pass on this, considering his work after he has gotten some clout has been legit. Not like Ken- who continues to clown around"

Lee Junghoon (1Team), Lee Junghoon / Daun (GreatGuys), and Lee Junghoon (TST)

For Donghyuns: Kim Donghyun / Donghwi (GreatGuys)

For Mingi/Minkis: Jeon Mingi / Uiyeon (GreatGuys)

For Woojins: Lee Woojin (Target) and Lee Woojin (MY.st). And if the Korean names for the overseas idols count, one of BM from KARD's Korean names is also Woojin.

For Yejis: Lee Yeji / J (ANS)

For Eunbis: Jeon Eunbi / Haena (ANS)

For Jiwons: Yu Jiwon / Bian (ANS)

For Junhos: Bang Junho / Kain (ARGON)

Park Jaehyung / Jae (Day6), Lee Jaehyeong (The Rose), and Seo Jaehyung / Di1e (AWEEK). Granted, the character for Day6's Jae is apparently written differently (Ï†ú as opposed to Ïû¨), so I'm not sure if it would count? But like another mentioned with the Minas, they're all said the same, as I remember hearing Jae say his name the same way as The Rose's in one of his videos with Woosung.

Kim Jaemin / Zeth (Target) and Na Jaemin (NCT)

Son Minhyun / Hyun (Target) and Hwang Minhyun (NU'EST and Wanna One)

Yoo Kangmin (VeriVery) and Kim Kangmin (TRCNG)

Kim Seokjin / Jin (BTS) and Seo Seokjin (N.CUS).

For Seunghyuns: Nam Seunghyun / SOON (N.CUS)

For Doyoungs: Kim Doyoung / Yuan (N.CUS)

If someone gets a hold of the episode, makes a big deal of it, it could potentially blacklist Dan Harmon and other creators that control the show, also the reputation of Netflix. It's a complicated issue sure, and I think the intentions are pure from both sides, despite it not necessarily being the best course of action for the company. However, I can empathize with the company's decision, maybe you can too, which I believe could potentially change your mind."
2169,2020-06-28 16:53:01,hhhjfq,"Perhaps they have not removed it permanently. Perhaps they have removed the episode temporarily while they have a discussion about what it means to have characters in blackface, whether it perpetuates harmful stereotypes, and whether they feel it is appropriate to host it on their services.

Honestly, I don't give a shit about community. I do give a shit about Always Sunny. I give lots of shits about Always Sunny. Hulu took down The Gang Makes Lethal Weapon V and I believe the episode where Dee dresses up as Taiwan Tammy. Am I salty? No, because as a society we ought to understand the power and impact of media. While I believe The Gang's use of racial stereotypes is not punching down, but rather it is punching inward by mocking The Gang's blind insensitivity, we have to ask ourselves is it really appropriate for white writers and a disproportionately white cast to comment on and satirize stereotypes that have long been used by white people to oppress minorities.

I don't see how you can ""support the BLM movement"" and not be asking yourself these same questions."

I don‚Äôt see netlfix and hulu deleting the episode where shirly makes racist comments about abed‚Äôs family culture and the islam being taken down. Why remove one episode where a racist joke is made and not deal with the other episodes? [why isn‚Äôt this scene seen as bad](https://youtu.be/j2odOu0Oguo), the whole character of pierce is a bigoted racist, [there is also the neo-nazi guys scene](https://youtu.be/wwDGm6JO4Lw). why is it that a guy in jet black make-up isn‚Äôt allowed but those are. 

Why is one form of racism in a show allowed while the others aren‚Äôt. Are the racist, sexist jokes and so wrong? Yeah they are. Why delete a whole episode for one joke, why not keep it up and teach people that the joke is wrong and that we are better than this. To me it is very hypocritical for hulu and netflix deleting that episode while there are also other offensive things in other episodes and deleting those."
2175,2020-06-28 17:17:27,hhhjfq,"I hate that ""punching down"" excuse. It's basically saying everyone is allowed to stereotype and be racist towards white people but God forbid you make a joke about someone of a difference race if you're white.

If everyone just stopped trying to be offended by everything we could harmlessly poke fun at one another, which in my opinion would bring us closer. I have some close black coworkers that are good friends of mine and we always rip on each others stereotypes and we're closer than ever."

2182,2020-06-28 17:25:14,hhhjfq,"That is literally a cosmic law of comedy. Being mean, ie making fun of the powerless is not funny. Making fun of the powerful *is* funny. In Always Sunny, the gang has privilege. They have literally *never* been arrested (except for that time on that cruise) even though they've impersonated police officers, blown up a range rover, attempted to file a false police report, been caught shoplifting, literally stalking a woman for years, sold alcohol to minors, and that's not even mentioning all the creepy shit Dennis has done off camera. They are the poster children of privilege. It is funny to watch them destroy themselves time and time again. But, when it comes to The Gang punching down, even though they're too ignorant and self-absorbed to know they're doing it, I think we have to question whether or not it is appropriate or whether it actually perpetuates stereotypes rather than deconstructs them."
2183,2020-06-28 17:05:28,hhhjfq,The joke clearly associated the dark elf makeup with blackface. I'm not sure how you could miss that connection there.

2186,2020-06-28 22:36:42,hhhjfq,I didn‚Äôt really care for chang being in that episode. To me it was funny that he came so prepared and so psyched to play but only to be killed right of the start.

2189,2020-06-28 19:29:53,hhhjfq,"Shirley took offense because she is offended by everything. Everyone else took it as Chang being his normal, over the top self. 

The joke of cutting to him in full makeup works because of the shock. No one else is made up. It also makes his early departure funnier since he clearly put more effort into preparing for the game than the others who are still playing. Shirley's comment is just an additional tag on the joke and shouldn't be taken as the definitive interpretation of the situation."

Or is it to show the majority completely ignored her and brushed off her concerns of something that represents historic racism and clearly made her uncomfortable? 

I don't think they should have pulled the episode, FYI. I think it does a good job of showing your point, that the intent of Chang was to not be offensive at all, but rather just go all in for DnD, while at the same time showing the majority that something we think is seemingly innocent, can still be offensive and hurtful."

They are afraid of backlash. You may not agree, but in the world it's a very real thing. It may not be deserved, but it's not something they want to pick a battle on, costing them money to deal with. It's far easier to remove that episode and be done with it for the time being. When there's less media attention on the issue, maybe it's worth reconsidering."
2196,2020-06-28 17:37:15,hhhjfq,"No you didn't. You stated some ""cosmic law"" of humor and then wrote a paragraph on how we should first view things through the lens of intersectionality before asking ourselves ""is it *ok* to laugh at this?""

2197,2020-06-28 20:52:37,hhhjfq,"Absolutely, but advocating for inequality through special privileges doesn't make things more equal.

If we instead advocated for the same standards for everyone we eventually would get there, however giving one side special privileges while simultaneously preaching equality only creates a disconnect and animosity."
2198,2020-06-28 20:10:08,hhhjfq,">something that represents historic racism

But is it? Chang clearly wasn't intending to portray an African American individual. Doesn't that matter? Isn't blackface about portrayals of black folk? How does a fantasy creature with no apparent connection to any racial group in reality get categorized as blackface?"
2199,2020-06-28 21:13:08,hhhjfq,You‚Äôre right on that. With the media standpoint and possible financial backlash it makes sense.  That isn‚Äôt what feels wrong to me. More the hypocritical thing they do by removing one episode with 1 short racist perceived joke but letting other episodes with blatant racist jokes stay.
2200,2020-06-28 18:36:37,hhhjfq,">making fun of the powerless is not funny

That's what I said. Your edgy, tired black people jokes aren't funny."
2201,2020-06-29 00:37:26,hhhjfq,"My point was that, if society was equal, it would be racist to believe that minorities don't have (complete) agency over their lives or are (completely) powerless. I added the word 'complete,' because it is not conjecture, it is reality. If every time you walk home at night, you risk getting killed for no reason by the police, you are not in control of your agency and you are powerless. I don't see how your comment about special privileges is relevant at all here. No one here mentioned special privileges."
2202,2020-06-29 00:32:54,hhhjfq,"That's my point. What Chang did had no intent to be patently offensive. But it is also understandable a black person would be offended by that without context, or even with context. I can't hang a swastika in my window and then claim it doesn't represent naziism because i'm displaying it the way the Roman's did. Some things, regardless of their intent, have become off-limits, and i think community did a good job illustrating that, hence, why I don't think they should have pulled the episode.

Edit: A word"
2203,2020-06-28 18:40:09,hhhjfq,"*My* edgy jokes, huh?

""Hey that guy isn't down with boring unfunny people gatekeeping humor - let's call him a racist""

Sterling tactics."
2204,2020-06-29 04:16:12,hhhjfq,"Society isn't equal. But you don't make it more equal bu treating people unequally (IE: privileges and benefits based on race).

You start by treating everyone the exact same regardless of skin color."
2205,2020-06-29 01:30:31,hhhjfq,"Had Chang been made up to look like Al Jolson or another obvious blackface caricature, I would agree with the swastika comparison.

Instead, a better comparison would be to someone hanging up the Union Jack and someone unfamiliar with the UK mistaking it for a confederate flag. Because then the offense isn't with what is actually there."

I agree that it could have been a little more balanced on the spy stuff, but I think it was a wise choice to keep it at a cool 1 hour and 40 mins instead of trying to fill in more storyline that would have been overshadowed by the family stuff anyways.

B+"
2327,2020-07-02 19:58:23,hgxeio,I've been walking by a poster for this movie for so long that it's become part of the landscape. Glad it finally saw the light of day. Hopefully that girl isn't too disappointed at how things have gone for her movie.
2328,2020-07-03 12:37:44,hgxeio,"I liked it. Yes, we have seen these movies all over the years but it was still heartwarming and entertaining. The kid actress was really pleasant surprise and Bautista was solid, again. Might even watch it again someday.  I'd say a decent 6/10 for the movie as a whole."
2329,2020-07-06 01:08:04,hgxeio,"Lots of heart, but predictable (at least the spy stuff).   Overall a fun film and a solid 6/10.    I miss Drax.   Bring on guardians 3"

2348,2020-06-28 09:58:52,hgxeio,"I think so but it depends on your threshold for whats tough to watch. There is a certain charm and heart that comes through that wasn't there in Stuber. The two main characters aren't really opposite people arguing with each other and Bautista always ends up doing the nice thing. It's also one of those movies where you can tell that he was having fun on set.

The main complaint just comes down to him being a little deadpan. Like, he is supposed to be this giant tough-guy, that's really a teddy bear, so he can get stabbed in the leg accidentally by his partner, he no sells the stabbing and that is played as comedy. That style works a lot better with Drax than it does this character because it can be a little inconsistent.

So I guess that's why I say it depends on your threshold for being tough to watch."

2354,2020-08-20 12:50:43,id8ve7,I watched Joey Contino's Masked Singer US vs UK video and he's incredibly close-minded towards the UK version. He didn't say one good thing about it.
2355,2020-08-20 12:26:13,id8ve7,"One is about to have it's 4th season, the other is about to have it's 2nd. Not the fairest of comparisons"
2356,2020-08-20 12:52:01,id8ve7,"COMPARABLE COSTUMES-

ü¶ä- UK by a hair, even though the ""mirror as outfit"" thing has become a trope for the franchise, especially for more low-effort outfits (like guest outfits, or outfits where the show is low budget by comparison)

üëæ- US, but the French knockoff tbh. Australia's is good too.

üåº- UK's. Both of them. 

üå≤- US', but mostly because it looks a bit smug.

ü¶Ñ- If I had to pick between the two, the UK's. He's cute. But tbh Australia beats them both. 

ü¶ã- US obvs. If I was Tim Simpson I'd be a bit more factually correct with trying to make a butterfly costume, with a bit more focus on the back wings, but maybe it's because I thought we'd wait until S2 to have a butterfly costume and I ended up looking at a ton of British butterfly breeds to visualise...

üêù- UK's. French one is good too. 

PANEL-

**Ken Jeong (US)** V Ken Jeong (U.K.) - Ken and his schtick flow better on the US version, for me. When/if he comes back for S3, he needs to be a bit less one-note. 

**Robin Thicke** v Jonathan Ross - Jonathan's guesses are more like Jenny's guesses. Aside from the obvious (guessing Daisy was the pushing-daisies Natalie Cole), we also had Fox as Sam Fox. And I bet one Jane Austen that he'll think a Lion is Leona Lewis (if the lion is a girl). As for past problematic behaviour, at least Wossy is trying to learn from his recent transphobic mistakes...

Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg v **Davina McCall** - DUH

Nicole Scherzinger v **Rita Ora** - I mean, Scherzy was good on The X Factor and great on the Sing-Off (even though she began all of her sentences with ""Um, girls..."" or ""Um, boys...""). But Rita's ""AWH DAHHHK"" schtick is really cute, and she's my favourite of the panellists (ok, Mo might give her a run for her money...)

Ken Jeong (US) v **Mo Gilligan** (new replacement for U.K. season 2) - Already fuming that Mo's only going to be in one series (that, or S3 will be filming earlier in September)

HOST-

Nick Cannon v **Joel Dommett** - Both are really good, but Nick's a hotep. 

COMPARABLE PERFORMANCES-

‚ÄúSomeone You Loved‚Äù- (Lewis Capaldi) Rottweiler v **Queen Bee** - same with Alive.

‚ÄúHappy‚Äù- (Pharrell Williams) Alien v **Monster** - Feel it Still (Alien vs Chameleon) is a tie though. 

‚ÄúCan‚Äôt Feel My Face‚Äù- (The Weeknd) Peacock v **Daisy** - by a hair. I'm surprised that >!Kelis!< could sound like that, but maybe I'm only really used to her singing quite softly. But also CFMF was Peacock's best performance, where we got to see a clean cut Mormon pull off singing about his love for cocaine. 

‚ÄúJuice‚Äù- (Lizzo) **Ladybug** v Unicorn - truly, the worst of Unicorn's performances

‚ÄúLivin‚Äô On a Prayer‚Äù- (Bon Jovi) Butterfly v **Duck** - again, by a hair. Both of them were quite boring tbh, but we got the electrocution moment from Butterfly, and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzJiNFCEtwY) from Duck.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Cha‚Äù- Pussycat Dolls **Leopard** v Monster - Yeah, I know, Don't Cha is Monster's song and was the first time seven-year-old me had heard of him, but Leopard beat him at his own game.

üåº-  both were so gorgeous, I can‚Äôt choose between them

üå≤- Teddy Sherringham‚Äôs costume: I thought the detail on it was amazing

ü¶Ñ-  Jake Sheers‚Äô costume: honestly I preferred Australia‚Äôs version but Tori Spelling has one of the worst costumes because it was so boring

Ken Jeong (U.K.): he was slightly less annoying on the UK version

Jonathan Ross: he was hilarious and he actually had decent guesses when he wasn‚Äôt joking around

Davina McCall: I didn‚Äôt like either of them but Jenny is more annoying

Nicole Scherzinger: she makes me laugh despite all of her crying and Rita was so annoying every time she guessed correctly

John snapped at him and told him to never do that again, or he's fired. Then John explained to Bobby that this kind of behavior happens to Asians all the time because they allow it, and you need to stop it in it's tracks.‚Äù-COpy and pasted from comments

> It's been half a year since Series 1. Now that the dust has settled... thoughts?

We did a really good job. US S3 seemed a bit too glossy by comparison, with one-note characters to boot, and Aus S2 seems a bit... sour. Maybe it's because I'm watching it live, but US S3 didn't seem sour when I watched it at bugger o'clock in the morning. Maybe watching SNL at similar hours made me used to it.

> Who do you want to see on Series 2? Who do you think will be on Series 2?

Well, I think this year's cohort are going to be somewhat predictable. 

* Robot's going to be a hot twenty-something white guy, who coasts on by singing Ed Sheeran and Shawn Mendes songs (and, of course, ""Before You Go"" by Lewis Capaldi - unless the Robot is actually Lewis Capaldi) and making Rita... um... excited... (Yeah, I know Chesney Hawkes is technically our Robot, but would he get Rita wet?)
* Lion is a lady (either Black or sounds like she's Black) with some serious pipes, so Wossy spends the entire competition going ""I think it'th Weona Wewith"". Turns out, it's not, because Leona being a Lion would be too on the nose. (Wossy's made that mistake before: ""IT'TH FAMANFA FOX"") It's someone whose name is listed [here](https://www.youngvoices.co.uk/who-are-yv/previous-artists/). (Yes, it is Dionne Bromfield!) She sings ""Rise Up"" at one point. 
- They adjust the Wolf costume and put an older White ""dad"" type in it. He opens the first episode with ""Let Me Entertain You"". He's probably done SoccerAid at one point, like Tree in the past and Hedgehog in the not-too-distant future.
- For some reason, they put a Black guy in a Crow costume, thus reverting time back to 1945. He pulls it off though. At one point, someone talks about ""Crow-na-virus"", and the judges think it's the funniest thing they've ever heard. He sings ""Ordinary People"" at one point. Professional singer.
- There's a Spider, who's a White lady who's done a bit of musical theatre.
- Our token gay guy covers ""Blinding Lights"" by The Weeknd. His costume is up in the air...
- There's an ice cream, who's a female TV personality with a more-than-passable voice
- There's an alien, who's female and a professional singer. Twitter continuously compares her costume to Kang and Kodos from The Simpsons
- There's a rabbit that does ""Diamonds Are A Girls Best Friend"" and ""Dance Monkey""
- The first two out are a Lil Wayne-style ""shock"" name who performs ""Shotgun"" by George Ezra dressed as a dinosaur/T-Rex, and a Black female Olympian. 
- Other costumes are a grab bag from: Swan, Snail, Knight, Frog, some sort of fish, Bulldog, Pig, Owl and Dragon. Because a ton of S2 costumes were designed pre-COVID, and that Justin and Nicola were barred from being a peacock/angel/mermaid in favour of what was on the list, don't expect to see those three costumes until S3 at the earliest.

> What do you want to see on Series 2? What do you think there will be on Series 2?

I know that US S2 has a combined audience of three, but I wonder if Joel's gonna come out in a cape and a mask. 

Again, maybe a Christmas Super Sneak Peek as well, with one clue per costume. Divided by vignettes, the masks singing Xmas songs, and a Joel/Rita duet because Celebrity Karaoke Club. Eleven costumes announced prior and one revealed during the peek. 

Smackdowns I'm not sure of in this climate.

I wonder if they'll use ""Fame"" by Irene Cara in the promos, like in Australia.

> Will there be a socially distanced audience? Will filming begin on my 22nd birthday?

On Zoom, at least. It'll be very hard work as compared to being in a studio, as it's a different environment and your phone isn't physically in a Yondr pouch.

~~I think I might be waiting a little later than my birthday, but that's OK.~~ WELP. FILMING DATES ARE BEFORE AND DURING MY BIRTHDAY WEEK. None directly on my birth date (September 23 babies!!!) but one before.

> Did COVID-19 avenge Ken Jeong? Who do you think will be replacing him, if anyone?

I think we're getting a man of colour. Most likely a comedian, but I can see a professional singer being cast, so it can be Davina/Jenny, Rita/Nicole, Wossy/Ken, new guy/Robin.

> Do you see I Can See Your Voice as competition?

Patrick McGuinness is an icon, but NO

> Will Royal Caribbean stay as sponsor? Dancing furries and all?

The recession means they probably will, but my only concern is that international cruises are a less lucrative concept in post-COVID times, even if a vaccine is probably gonna come out by series' end. (However, Rolling In It is being sponsored by a holiday park. It's domestic though, so...)

In Australia, the show has four sponsors - KFC (with idents featuring the masks and Men In Black), Big W (kinda like the Aussie B&M Bargains), Foster Grant sunglasses (with Dannii wearing a pair and going ""Who's behind the Foster Grants?"") and Vodafone. KFC isn't possible (thanks Boris!), and I don't know if B&M or Foster Grant do sponsorships in the UK, but Vodafone are currently sponsoring The Voice Kids. Hmmm...

- a flamingo (probably a failed female pop star like Pixie Lott)

- a giraffe (someone pretty tall)
- a pirate with a skull mask (maybe a Paralympian seeing as how popular depictions of pirates are amputees)

Probably a non white comedian or entertainer would be chosen to feature on the show as Ken is the only one on the panel who isn‚Äôt Caucasian. My best guess would probably be Richard Blackwood or Alison Hammond if they aren‚Äôt in the costumes that is.

Will Royal Caribbean be next season‚Äôs sponsor?-

Probably not due to how much money cruise companies have lost out due to the pandemic. I could see brands such as a supermarket chain like Morrison‚Äôs being this season‚Äôs sponsor or a brand in an industry that hasn‚Äôt lost out money due to the pandemic. Due to the new ban on junk food advertising before 9pm, I wouldn‚Äôt think a junk food brand would sponsor the show."

Stray Kids' Cle: Levanter just barely squeaked into the bottom of the list after several months out of it.

OnlyOneOf pushed 4K units this month, a couple of months after release.  That's a bit unusual, especially for a group this nugu (normally, they hit and then drop completely), so that's promising if you're a fan.

ATEEZ did far and away better than I ever expected.  Their last comeback in January, they pushed 62K units in the first week.  Now they're selling 208K in three days.  This Atiny is verklempt.

I live in Korea and order albums regularly, even of groups I just like without being a huge fan of, because they cost around 17,000~19,000 won ($14-$16 USD) on pre-release/release week and then get cheaper from there - you can often pick up something from a few months ago for 12,000 won ($10) or so new or 6,000 won ($5) used. So I pick up 5 or 10 albums a month, about half new stuff and half catalog stuff of groups I like. But if I was paying $25 or $35 or more per album (even $50 in some countries due to shipping and customs) I'd definitely skip that and just stream.

Listen up people looking for something to invest in: if Kpop is popular in your country and you have an idea of how to cut ""middle man"" costs significantly (by shipping in huge bulk or something), there's a lot of money to be made by offering CDs at around western prices instead of the inflated prices they currently go for overseas. Or if companies figure out a way to ship stuff directly from the factory to sellers in other major markets (like Amazon) and skip routing everything through Korean retailers, that would also boost international sales."

I think that's selling I-fans a bit short. Japanese and Chinese fans give big sales boosts, e.g. for Mamamoo and G(I)-dle. 

Since more Western stores have started selling kpop album, sales have also improved on that front, so I think a big reason for less Western sales were the shipping costs and customs fees"

2484,2020-08-02 21:13:05,i2fs5h,"There's a ton of different reasons.  Shipping, demographic, all of that plays a part into it.  I probably do regularly pay $20-30 once shipping is included into all of them, and more if it's a Japanese version (though, I have found a source in the US that has cut the price down by a few bucks).

But in the end, the groups all have bills to pay just as much as you do.  It doesn't matter how many reasons or excuses you have.  Reasons and excuses are just air in the end, and no one is going to be able to eat air.

Reality is, unfortunately, a harsh mistress."
2485,2020-08-02 21:04:50,i2fs5h,"Not as familiar with Got7 or Stray Kids' fanbases, but they never came off as overly Western to me.  Could also be wrong.

As for ifans, I don't consider Japanese and Chinese fans to be grouped in with ifans (and also from just how the word is used, it seems most people use ifans to refer to Western fans and if they want o talk about Chinese or Japanese fans, they will indicate that is the group they are talking about).  So, when I use ifans here, I mean specifically Western fans, as in American (both continents) and European."
2486,2020-08-03 02:38:07,i2fs5h,I'm aware it was on the May chart.  The chart above includes those numbers.  It also states in the far right field that the last update was in May.

2488,2020-08-07 20:23:00,i2fs5h,Gasp! Not even Mamamoo?? Why??? That kinda sucks. I wonder why GGs don‚Äôt do as well?
2489,2020-08-02 21:16:13,i2fs5h,"In this case (because I'm the one who made the comment that this is being sourced from), ifans is just Westerners.

If I wanted to talk about non-Western non-Korean fans, I would have used been more country specific (cfans, Japanese fans, etc).

Edit: spelling"
2490,2020-08-03 05:40:02,i2fs5h,"Stray Kids are very global in terms of their fan base, I‚Äôm sure partially due to Aussie line and their general musical direction. Their lack of Korean recognition is a frequent discussion point with fans."

2493,2020-08-03 03:57:57,i2fs5h,"My numbers include the monthly totals.  Yes, there are months that they didn't make the charts in between the months that they did, which is why it has the + sign included with the numbers.  Because it's that number + more from when they didn't make the chart.  

I don't have the time, nor the inclination to watch the daily charts to grab every single unit that is sold.  If you are interested in daily updates, I would recommend that you check Twitter, as there are several accounts that do follow it."

2497,2020-08-03 04:18:00,i2fs5h,"Actually, it would make my numbers inaccurate because it changes how the numbers are pulled from and makes them come from multiple charts, with possibly multiple sources that I can't verify the accuracy of.  I don't have the time for it.

As I stated, this chart goes off the monthly numbers.  If an album doesn't make the monthly chart, those units don't get counted.  Only 100 albums make the list every month, so there are a bunch of albums that don't make it.

You are more than welcome to get your numbers from somewhere else if you prefer."
2498,2020-08-02 18:17:06,i2fs5h,Oh yeah now I remember seeing the physical is for this month so it counts for August then... I forgot about that sorry üòÖ
2499,2020-08-02 18:23:05,i2fs5h,"N/p.  The album does have a July release date, so I'm not sure if there's just a delay on the physicals or if she just didn't sell enough to hit the chart at all.  Either are possible."
2500,2020-08-02 19:51:08,i2fs5h,Yeah I read somewhere that the physicals will be delayed... that seems to be the reason.

2512,2020-07-28 16:59:24,hzi1rh,I havent watched the recent episodes but just had to watch the latest episode because of Alison Brie! But why did they disable the comments in that video and many prior videos?

Anyone else get major Robin Williams vibes from Alison? She's so goddamn funny and great at improv and quick I think she missed her calling in Improv.
2515,2020-07-29 13:52:55,hzi1rh,Props to Joel. He was seriously funny this episode.
2516,2020-07-29 15:12:07,hzi1rh,[I found an article](https://uproxx.com/filmdrunk/xan-spencer-seems-like-a-real-go-getter/) about the 'Xan' that Alison mentioned during the two many feet bit - wonder if he inspired the ['Zan'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKb67ynqnzM&feature=youtu.be&t=35) character in Atlanta ü§î
2517,2020-07-29 07:38:05,hzi1rh,I enjoyed this episode even more than the first time she came on considering her first appearance was already great. Not only was it hella funny but I learned fun new trivia about Community as well.

2525,2020-07-28 22:19:47,hzi1rh,She's very funny and seems to be very herself. There's no 'fake niceness for the camera' attitude from her.
2526,2020-07-31 19:12:38,hzi1rh,If you haven't heard/seen the other episode of the podcast with her it is also hilarious. She is the best!

This is where they returned from the hiatus due to the escalating BLM protests, and they discus the situation to a great extend in this one. From this point on and forward, all comment sections were disabled (even though they don't even mention BLM)."
2541,2020-07-28 17:12:10,hzi1rh,"Ha, yea. It was cool to watch it live, and $20 isn't that much, but at the same time I didn't get any of my questions answered (you just post them in a chat with everyone else). There is a VIP which includes a private one on one video chat with Joel for $145 and they all got prioritized for their questions being answered by Joel, Ken, and Alison. Make sense since they paid that much, but it seemed like only a couple of Non-VIP questions were answered. Still fun to see it live, the chat with other Community fans live was hilarious. But since they put it on YT after, not sure I'd do it again."
2542,2020-08-09 19:47:04,hzi1rh,"Ah you're right on the rolling on the ground part, but she definitely got high episode 5 and flirted with various things and it was amazing."
2543,2020-07-29 19:45:52,hzi1rh,Ohh okay. I had only watched the first 5 and this one so I didn't know.
2544,2020-08-01 05:45:35,hzi1rh,"I watched it live, and did the meet and greet with Joel afterwards. He's frigging awesome.

I get the point about paying for it live, when its on YouTube the next day, but I honestly like to support artist I enjoy (or at least that's how I justify it!)"

2546,2020-07-25 23:31:26,hxsu0c,"I don't wish to comment on the quality of this show's writing or humour, as I've never seen it, but I will say that the apparent animation style is just stupefyingly off-putting. A lot of people were complaining in the threads about the new Star Trek cartoon *Lower Decks* that it was using the same animation style that loads of other modern adult cartoons are, but when I see this as an alternative I am 100% okay with them sticking with the other one forever."
2547,2020-07-25 21:05:46,hxsu0c,It wasn't canceled?  I thought that other cartoon show with quirky characters had replaced it.

2552,2020-07-25 23:33:34,hxsu0c,It‚Äôs something I‚Äôve see people complain about it. They also complained about a lot of other adult animations and how they look like Star Trek Lower Decks Duncanville and Hoops.
2553,2020-07-25 22:56:28,hxsu0c,Both are still running. Bless the Harts will run in the fall and Duncanville will be back in spring.
2554,2020-07-25 21:06:06,hxsu0c,What other show?
2555,2020-07-26 13:21:17,hxsu0c,They are sharing the timeslot. BTH in the Fall and Duncanville in Winter/Spring
2556,2020-07-26 16:18:08,hxsu0c,Yes but I kinda like how it looks like a bitmoji
2557,2020-07-25 22:57:24,hxsu0c,Don‚Äôt forget we will be getting the Great North (new show) at the same time Duncanville returns. Basically in the winter/spring you‚Äôll have 3 hours of animated programming.
2558,2020-07-26 05:58:17,hxsu0c,And both are equally as horrible
2559,2020-07-25 21:12:28,hxsu0c,"You know, that cartoon with the 3 kids, one is a mischievous son and one really young.  The father is well-meaning but can be sort of an idiot.  The mother is long-suffering.  It's full of random guest stars like ALF.  That one."
2560,2020-07-26 15:53:18,hxsu0c,No they aren‚Äôt sharing the timeslot anymore actually. Bless the Harts has a 22 episode second season.
2561,2020-07-25 22:04:32,hxsu0c,Oh Duncanville yeah what about it?
2562,2020-08-12 18:20:08,hxsta7,Great casting. I like Ken Jeongs dentist character on Bobs Burgers so hopefully it's like that.
2563,2020-07-25 20:09:13,hxsta7,Holly Hunter as well
2564,2020-08-12 19:05:04,hxsta7,The episode where Dr. Yap has a college frat is gold!
2565,2020-07-25 01:03:24,hxdrx6,And Ann B. Davis as Alice
2566,2020-07-25 01:04:49,hxdrx6,Strongly disagree on John C. Reilly. Stephen Root is still perfect for the part. Also I might plug Jared Keeso in as Dale. Get him all amped up on Mountain Dew and see what happens.

2575,2020-07-25 01:15:02,hxdrx6,Haha a little old school I‚Äôm glad someone picked up on it! And Ken Jeong as Khan would be perfect

2578,2020-07-25 01:23:55,hxdrx6,"Connie Chung now? No. 
I think the actress who voices her would be a good casting. She sort of looks like her too!"

2581,2020-07-20 23:49:11,huwjh6,Has anyone read the book?
2582,2020-07-20 22:48:30,huqf97,I honestly thought it would‚Äôve preferred the movie if they‚Äôd stayed kids throughout the whole film and it was like an origin story for the gang. I mean i enjoyed it but i feel like that would‚Äôve been a better direction to go than superheroes. Also i kinda missed Scooby Doo when the monsters weren‚Äôt real. Every single piece of scooby doo media since the 2000‚Äôs has the monsters being real and the gang has to stop them somehow. Can we not just get an elaborate story where it turns out there was a puppet master the whole time and none of it was real?
2583,2020-07-21 02:44:50,huqf97,"In my personal opinion I thought the movie was okay. But couldve been so much better, and one of the main problems I had with it was that it was trying to deviate away from what scooby doo usually is. Which I guess there nothing wrong with that, but the problem is that not only is the execution really messy but also it takes away an element that even the non-traditional scooby doo movies had. Mystery. And I believe there are two fix this. 1. Keep the gang as children and make it more of an origin story. You can still have it be the start if a cinematic universe if you want, but have the main plot be an origin story with them as kids, and then the ending can have a time jump to when they are adults, setting up both the next movie and the Hanna Barbara Cinematic Universe. Or 2. The one I am going with, is that we keep the superhero element in but we change up the plot by adding 5he mystery element back in. As well as making the Monsters....well, not real. 

So without further a do, I shall begin. This is SCOOB!: The Darrylthedudewayne Cut.

The opening with them as kids can remain the same since a lot of people liked that opening, I would also keep the recreation of the scooby doo intro the same. I wished they used the one from the earlier seasons of the old show instead of the one from later seasons, but it still does its job well so it can also stay the same. That being said I am removing the one part with Fred on the date with the Mystery Inc. Machine. Mainly because his weird love for it comes out of nowhere and doesn't even play a role in his character or the movie.

We then cut to them in the restaurant like in the actual movie. Where Fred (also voiced by Frank Welker because if you have him and he's also voiced Fred then mine as well have him voiced Fred in this as well as scoob. And dont give me the excuse that he's too old. If he can still pull off both Galvatron in Transformers 4 and Scoob in this movie, I'm pretty sure he can pull off Fred), Daphine (voiced by Grey Delisle), Velma (voiced by Gina Rodriguez), and Scooby and Shaggy (voiced by Frank Welker & Mathew Lillard respectively) are sitting at one of the tables. Fred informs the group that he recieved an email this morning from someone regarding there next case, which from the sounds of it will be there biggest one yet. Shaggy & Scoob basically make jokes about. Asking how big it could and then a voice off screen says ""really big"" and entering the room is a grown up Dexter from Dexter's Laboratory (Voiced by Hugo Weaving) whom informs the group that the case he has from them is that Blue Falcon and Dinomutt need there help stopping a mysterious hooded ghost calling himself ""Icarus"" whom is opening portals to unleash monsters from other worlds, Velma asks if it's the same Icarus responsible for that Lava Monster incident in Hawaii & Dexter confirms that it is. He then stats that Blue Falcon personally needs there help to stop him. 

Shaggy & Scoony are ecstatic at first, until Dexter tells them that he doesnt want scooby or shaggy involved because he views them as useless. The other three try to vouche for the Shaggy & Scooby but Dexter says either they are not on the case or all of them are not on the case. Insulted Shaggy & Scooby leave. If you are wondering I am having Dexter be the third wheel with Dinomutt & Blue Falcon instead of Dee Dee because not only is she kindof pointless and didnt need to be in the movie, but also it makes no sense. Especially when you take into account that she has nothing to do with Blue Falcon and it make more sense for her to be with Captain Caveman and the other Dee Dee girls. So instead I am using Dexter from Dexter laboratory whom actually has a history with the two heroes.

Anyways we then cut to the scene with them in the bowling alley which also plays the same as the actual movie. Anyways when the enter the Falcon fury they are reunited with the rest of the mystery Inc. Gang where its revealed that Blue Falcon actually did want them and it was actually Dexter whom didnt want Shaggy & Scooby, Dexter enters and begrudgingly takes them to the main area of the ship where where we get Blue Falcon's introduction which plays out the same as the actual movie except Fred, Velma, & Daphne are there. Also all the modern day humor is relegated to blue falcon and blue Falcon only because.....do I really need to explain why, anyways they fill them in further on what's at stake and how this icarus has been using his ghost and monster friends to scare and ravage both Europe as well as parts of Africa and the US. They believe he originated in Greece and also where most of his attacks are so they are going to start there.

I'm not going to give a scene by scene if this especially since I have been writing this since 7 pm trying to figure out all the stuff I want to do, on top of being distracted by other stuff so I'll just highlight what happens in the rest of the movie.

Basically they do there usual mystery solving and woven into it can be some of the superhero stuff they wanted, with the gang helping Blue Falcon and Dinomutt fight off the monsters and Ghost that Icarus unleashes. Which I would distinct and unique designs for each one, Scooby and Shaggy can have a falling out half way through the movie but it wont feel as forced as it does in the actual movie, and also the humor is much better. Oh and the rest if the gang are actually characters with actual arcs as well. Anyways near the end scoob gets captured by Icarus and the two teams begin to argue. However Shaggy stops this by giving a motivational speech, and they go after the villain. Whom is bringing out the big guns for the climax as he unleashes army of ghost, and the most dangerous monster yet, a fusion of all the elements. They stop him and it turns out there actually projections caused by little drone like robots. 

They remove Icarus mask to see whom the ghostly demon really is, & it turns out to be The cop from the beginning of the movie (because youtuber Dazzreviews suggested it when the first trailer came out and goddamnit I am sticking with that because that just sounds hilarious to me). They find out he was using very high tech projections to pull off his scheme and that his flying is actually a special cape glider. He reveals his motivations and how he feels everyone looks up to superhero so much rather then actual everyday heroes, and so he decided to get his revenge by going after the scooby gang. Also if your wondering where he got the drones from well its revealed that he got them from Dick Dastardy, setting him up as the villain for a Blue Falcon and Dinomutt standalone movie.

The films ending sequence with them opening an new shop, Blur Falcon as there DJ, and them getting a new case plays out the same as it does in the actual movie.

The after credits scene would be setting up the Hanna Barbara Cinematic Universe, with Dexter revealing in his folders references to over Hanna barbara characters to Blue Falcon and Dinomutt."

2585,2020-07-17 18:40:54,hszf19,"I actually think fans have a lot of power. Shows are based on ratings. If all the fans that are genuinely upset by Nick Cannon truly boycotted the show on all platforms when it comes back and rating go down they would either cancel the show completely (which fans could show outrage) or they would realize that having Nick Cannon in it is causing the ratings to lower. 
Now it‚Äôs not the fans fault, but don‚Äôt think that you don‚Äôt have a voice. Even if your voice is by not watching it anymore until something changes."
2586,2020-07-18 09:08:59,hszf19,Nick is also the executive producer of the show too so...
2587,2020-07-18 21:50:47,hszf19,"My mind immediately zoomed into two words you just said that describe my favorite part of the show: singing furries.

I honestly don't know what to think about the man. Part of me feels like maybe he should be fired because his presence is obviously contaminating the show."
2588,2020-07-16 01:51:48,hrw3gq,"I haven‚Äôt had the time to listen to all of them, but their episode with Alison Brie is great. It goes off the rails pretty quick, but she‚Äôs hilarious the entire time, and they all just bounce off each other perfectly. 

It‚Äôs obviously not the movie, but it fills the Community sized hole in my heart well enough for now."
2589,2020-07-15 22:38:42,hrw3gq,"im listening to the most recent episode with nathan fillion rightnow. This has quickly become one of my favorite podcasts.    Ken and Joel have the best chemistry together, and they are starting to get bigger and bigger guests.   Literally, in the case of Shaq!    Also all the episodes with Jim Rash are instant classics
  
Its such a casual and easy-listening podcast - they still dont even have sponsors.   Also apparently at one point Ken Jeong and Shaq filmed a pilot together where they would just go to random cities and try weird activities together.  *and somehow it didnt get greenlit!!*"
2590,2020-07-16 13:00:30,hrw3gq,If you only have time for a few episodes I highly recommend the ones with Jim Rash. They just bounce so well off of each other.
2591,2020-07-16 15:38:09,hrw3gq,I wait and watch them all on Youtube.  This is the first thing on youtube I've actually hit the bell on so I'm notified when the new episodes are up.  I'm glad they are doing this because they want to do this and they just kind of keep it real.
2592,2020-07-16 02:28:25,hrw3gq,funny interview. I think it's time to start listening their podcast (also the one from Zach Braff/Donald Faison too)
2593,2020-07-16 20:01:39,hrw3gq,Have they addressed the drowface issues?
2594,2020-07-16 00:02:57,hrw3gq,AND A MOVIE!!$
2595,2020-07-16 18:07:47,hrw3gq,"I must be in the minority.  As a huge Community fan, I don't really love the podcast.  I get that they're new to the medium, but Joel comes across as surprisingly tongue tied for an actor who's hosted his own show.  And Ken is earnest but really seems to into celebrity pandering (how many shout-outs do we need in one episode)?  
  
I'm probably coming across as entirely too harsh.  I did really enjoy some of the episodes, especially the ones with community alums, but I just found myself losing interest half way through.  Honestly, I think a lot of it could be 'fixed' with some heavy editing, but I get that they're just doing this to kill time and provide some light entertainment in an otherwise shitty time."
2596,2020-07-17 00:47:12,hrw3gq,Has the sound gotten any better?  I had to stop listening during episode 2 because it sounded like a 2 year old mixed it.
2597,2020-07-16 11:13:21,hrw3gq,">It‚Äôs obviously not the movie, but it fills the Community sized hole in my heart well enough for now.

Would a Community videogame suffice instead? https://projecthawkthorne.com"
2598,2020-07-16 02:21:27,hrw3gq,Which is that episode? The show notes don't specify!
2599,2020-07-18 13:24:33,hrw3gq,The best part is you see the real life love and friendship that these people actually have for each other. It just makes a show like community even better knowing they love eachother and it as much as we do.
2600,2020-07-16 01:47:50,hrw3gq,"Their episodes with 'Covid correspondent' Brent Terhune was hilarious. I was confused for a few minutes because I had no idea he's a comedian

Edit: episode 20 and 23(with Shaq)"
2601,2020-07-16 03:36:38,hrw3gq,"For a brand new podcast, they're doing fairly well. You can tell they've been friends for years"
2602,2020-07-16 03:39:42,hrw3gq,"Cool, I'll check it out. I watched a bit of one on youtube early on, seemed a bit rough. Thanks for the recommendation though, I'll definitely check out  Captain Tight Pants on it. Joel and Ken are awesome."
2603,2020-07-16 22:18:27,hrw3gq,"I haven't listened to any except the post-livestream episode, but do they mention the D&D episode removal? I'm very interested to see what they think"
2604,2020-07-17 18:59:27,hrw3gq,"I have the same feeling.  It‚Äôs good from time to time, but I‚Äôm a little tired of the name dropping and interrupting that goes on.  On the other hand, it‚Äôs free and they‚Äôre genuine, so it‚Äôs still in my feed."
2605,2020-07-19 13:20:12,hrw3gq,"I love the show, but Ken‚Äôs gushing over the guests telling them they‚Äôre the greatest gets old quick."
2606,2020-07-16 02:39:00,hrw3gq,"Should be Episode 5. 

She doesn‚Äôt get on until about halfway through, but it‚Äôs pretty consistently funny from then on."
2607,2020-07-17 03:29:03,hrw3gq,She says she ate an edible so I'm sure that helped her amazing riffs between topics. She was in fire during that podcast.
2608,2020-07-13 15:39:00,hqh0b5,Dwayne Johnson as Lisa miller
2609,2020-07-13 15:40:22,hqh0b5,That could work...
2610,2020-09-06 19:01:57,inq07q,The entire cast of JAG will be on and he won‚Äôt guess it.
2611,2020-09-06 17:30:24,inq07q,Watch Bjork be the mushroom
2612,2020-09-06 17:39:04,inq07q,Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
2613,2020-09-07 00:59:13,inq07q,Maybe bjork will be the jellyfish
2614,2020-09-06 19:09:23,inq07q,Totally! My guess it‚Äôs giraffe
2615,2020-09-06 21:59:08,inq07q,Who the fuck is Bjork even?
2616,2020-09-06 21:27:41,inq07q,I‚Äôm pretty sure the Giraffe is Male.
2617,2020-09-07 00:11:43,inq07q,A God
2618,2020-09-06 21:45:47,inq07q,Like we thought about Leopard that he was female???
2619,2020-09-07 00:31:50,inq07q,Well maybe God will prevent Masked Singer from cheating contestants this time then.
2620,2020-09-06 21:54:03,inq07q,Hmmm... True dat. The Giraffe does look a little bit feminine despite looking like Beethoven.
2621,2020-09-07 00:54:02,inq07q,who cheated?
2622,2020-09-07 20:07:54,inq07q,Giraffe has short stubby fingers. Now Reddit go and check out celebrity hands for comparison XD
2623,2020-09-07 00:59:41,inq07q,Evidently the voting system was ignored or rigged and they had decided on the winner of s3 before people voted
2624,2020-09-18 03:49:03,inq07q,Well I don't think that means the contestant was cheating but I see what you're saying
2625,2020-09-18 04:59:02,inq07q,"No no no, I don't think she had anything to do with it at all tbh. I think it was all the shows producers, directors etc."
2626,2020-09-18 06:07:19,inq07q,yeah thats wrong nonetheless
2627,2020-09-18 06:51:50,inq07q,What do you mean? Me thinking that the show was rigged?
2628,2020-09-18 07:01:31,inq07q,Nah. Them rigging the show. That's just wrong
2629,2020-09-18 07:02:56,inq07q,"Ah yeah I agree. I don't have any other explanation though. With the backlash I saw from reddit and twitter, even on Instagram and YouTube. I find it hard to believe any other reason."
2630,2020-09-03 18:14:40,ilwnq2,"No disrespect to Ken at all, but I would prefer guests to be folks involved in making the show that we all enjoy so much.

Though I would love a Cox rants about Hugh Jackman episode, featuring Johnny C and Hugh Jackman just for the banter"
2631,2020-09-03 16:40:12,ilwnq2,"Nah, I'd prefer people who were involved with scrubs"
2632,2020-09-03 17:12:53,ilwnq2,Maybe in Season 9 when were going to need the most entertaining guests to make up for the show content.
2633,2020-09-03 20:50:20,ilwnq2,Would rather have real JD.
2634,2020-09-03 20:20:24,ilwnq2,"Nobody cares u/FerociousPinecone , nobody cares"
2635,2020-09-03 17:12:38,ilwnq2,No
2636,2020-09-03 17:19:07,ilwnq2,"No thanks, Scrubs people only please"
2637,2020-09-03 18:08:20,ilwnq2,"I could see it, assuming he‚Äôs a fan of the show. My fear is, knowing Ken Jeong, that it would turn into Ken gushing about the show‚Äôs accuracy without providing many specific examples."
2638,2020-09-03 18:43:26,ilwnq2,"Like others said, I'd like if they kept it to people involved with Scrubs. Also, Ken Jeong seems to be a huge attention hog. He always brings the spotlight back to him and it's exhausting to listen to. I can only imagine him and Zacky trying to battle for who gets to speak more."
2639,2020-09-03 21:49:24,ilwnq2,"Has anyone listened to Ken's and Joel McHale's podcast called The Darkest Timeline? It is fairly new like newer than Fake Doctors Real Friends. I tried, I think I made it through 3 before giving it up, I can't tell if it was bad or just FDRF is so much better."
2640,2020-09-04 01:42:58,ilwnq2,"Seeing as he wasn't involved with Scrubs, no."
2641,2020-09-03 17:26:02,ilwnq2,God no.  He's unbearable to listen to on The Darkest Timeline.
2642,2020-09-03 18:29:50,ilwnq2,"Would be hard since I don't how many times he has worked with them. I believe a program with someone outside Scrubs would work if they have some relationship with Donald or Zach. Like, Alicia Silverstone would work because he and Donald were in Clueless. Zach could invite Natalie Portman to speak about Garden State. This as a special episode would do great."
2643,2020-09-03 23:57:33,ilwnq2,"Community x Scrubs crossover?  

Jk, they mention scrubs in the show. Abed calls Jeff 40% Zach Braff"
2644,2020-09-03 20:09:42,ilwnq2,"That wouldn't work, especially because it's not being made anymore"
2645,2020-09-03 20:32:59,ilwnq2,No shit? The guy was a doctor before turning comedian? Good for him
2646,2020-09-03 21:11:40,ilwnq2,is Ken even doing his podcast anymore? I dont think anything has been posted for a month
2647,2020-09-04 00:48:08,ilwnq2,Yeah I'd be absolutely be fine with that. He's brilliant and hilarious. He'd be a great guest
2648,2020-09-04 01:56:09,ilwnq2,I'd like Dave Franco to guest with Alison Brie
2649,2020-09-03 17:45:29,ilwnq2,I like it. Seems fun. Would probably learn more behind the scenes info from Ken then we do weekly from Zach and Donald.
2650,2020-09-04 01:22:39,ilwnq2,Dudes a quack
2651,2020-09-04 01:42:51,ilwnq2,No cuz I don‚Äôt find him funny at all
2652,2020-09-04 00:09:36,ilwnq2,"I do agree. I love how they never really elaborate what cox‚Äôs problem with hugh jackman is. All we know is for some reason cox has great disdain for hugh jackman. 

I really wished jackman made a guest appearance on scrubs so cox could ‚Äúlet him have it.‚Äù"
2653,2020-09-03 17:29:02,ilwnq2,"Same, love Community but I much prefer having Scrubs people on a Scrubs rewatch podcast."
2654,2020-09-03 16:43:03,ilwnq2,Yep. Same.
2655,2020-09-03 17:26:23,ilwnq2,You mean the season with 2 of the 5 funniest jokes in the series?
2656,2020-09-04 00:55:34,ilwnq2,"I‚Äôve finally tapped out. They spend so much time saying things like ‚Äònow you know I hate to compliment you‚Äô and teasing each other and whatnot, it‚Äôs just infuriating. There is some really good stuff but it‚Äôs buried in so much nonsense it just not worth the time. FDRF is way better.

The cast (Joel, Ken, Annie, Gillian, Donald, Danny, Jim and Pedro Pascale who filled in for the lawyer) did a table read of episode 504 (Pierce‚Äôs will reading) via Zoom, it‚Äôs on YouTube and is freaking hilarious, you should definitely watch that."
2657,2020-09-03 21:12:52,ilwnq2,"I'm not sure, I only recently discovered it. Do podcasts typically do seasons or do they just power through the whole year?"
2658,2020-09-03 20:20:00,ilwnq2,[deleted]
2659,2020-09-04 00:49:54,ilwnq2,It was just a random popular celebrity at the time. It was a throw away joke. There'd be even less of a point to have him as a guest than Ken Jeong
2660,2020-09-03 17:29:50,ilwnq2,"Now I have to hear your top five jokes.
If the lightbulb in the ass one isn't there I'm out"
2661,2020-09-03 17:30:42,ilwnq2,Very curious to your to 5 jokes!
2662,2020-09-04 00:59:55,ilwnq2,"Yeah there were funny parts but not enough of them, there is so much potential there Community and Scrubs are my 2 favorite comedies ever I think there could be a good podcast there but I don't think Ken and Joel are the right ones to do it. I'll check out the table read I wasn't going to because i figured it would be boring but if you say it is hilarious I'm going to have to check it out."
2663,2020-09-03 22:08:24,ilwnq2,Why would Ken jeong have more behind the scenes info on a show he wasn't on than the two main characters of the show?
2664,2020-09-04 01:49:58,ilwnq2,Idk couldve found out why cox hated him so much or to find out they actually get along.
2665,2020-09-03 17:34:00,ilwnq2,"Of course that's top 5.  The others are ""you're a diabetic?"" ""Yes sir, I told you that"" ""I thought you were kidding"" ""how is that funny?!"" ""Well it's a very serious disease and I dont like you"".

Cole's autotuned responses to his cancer.

2666,2020-09-03 17:46:35,ilwnq2,Need Labradoodle rant to be in there
2667,2020-09-03 17:34:11,ilwnq2,Posted them in the other response to my comment.
2668,2020-09-04 01:07:40,ilwnq2,There‚Äôs a part of the table read I watched a few times because it was hysterical. I may have to go back and watch it again today.
2669,2020-09-03 22:34:32,ilwnq2,It was just a joke regarding how little behind the scenes info is revealed on the podcast. I actually enjoy the podcast quite a bit. But if you bring up this fact it triggers the fans and Zach and Donald pretty bad lol. Of course Ken wouldnt know more about the show I just wanted to be a dick because disturbing the Reddit hivemind gives me life at times. Also I think Ken would be a fun guest even for a few minutes on the show. Apparently r/scrubs disagrees
2670,2020-09-04 01:55:13,ilwnq2,"I feel like it was just a throwaway joke and they chose him randomly, they could have just as easily used Heath Ledger or any other popular actor of the time. I'm sure they'd get along, they're both good people. But Hugh Jackman would have like nothing to add about the show at all"
2671,2020-09-03 21:46:12,ilwnq2,"Ok, those are pretty solid"
2672,2020-09-03 22:46:43,ilwnq2,"Ahhhh I see. My bad,  sorry if I came at you all dorian."
2673,2020-09-04 01:58:13,ilwnq2,Well they use the joke quite a few times throughout the series and the fact theyre in burbank (roughly LA area) jackman couldve been a patient who got hurt doing his own stunt or anything getting hurt or sick while filming in a nearby area. Could def be a B story. I mean wouldnt be any different than having Colin Ferral guest star for an episode.
2674,2020-09-03 21:47:16,ilwnq2,I'll defend season 9 til the day I die.
2675,2020-09-04 02:12:36,ilwnq2,"Yeah they call it back but its still just a random actor. But you just made all of that up. And no, because Colin Ferral was actually on the show"
2676,2020-09-03 21:52:30,ilwnq2,"To be honest, I didn't hate it! It gets a lot of hate and I think the main reason is just that season 8 was really strong, and had a perfect ending, so season 9 just felt out of place(in my opinion anyway), but if I watch it as its own thing, I enjoy it alot"
2677,2020-09-03 22:47:09,ilwnq2,"I think it stands alone well as a spin-off. I enjoy the shows. 

It‚Äôs a horrible season 9 though."
2678,2020-09-04 02:15:51,ilwnq2,"Yeah but before colin was on the show they had to make that up to. Thats part of the process of story writing before they get an actor.

I just pitched an episode story the same way the writers pitched a story that eventually guest starred colon ferral."
2679,2020-09-04 01:01:44,ilwnq2,It wasn't supposed to be a season 9. They tried making scrubs into ER basically
2680,2020-09-04 02:29:39,ilwnq2,Yeah but you're not a writer on a this show that's been over for years
2681,2020-08-31 07:09:28,ijtb9g,"THere is one thing in Hollywood credits that's almost universally true: when someone in the cast gets a word in front of their name (""with,"" ""featuring"" or ""and""), that person got more money. 

Guest stars (who do **not** get more money unless they are really famous) go after ""Also starring"" or ""Guest starring""."
2682,2020-08-31 10:42:32,ijtb9g,"Also related, why does just some of the cast get ""as"" behind their name?  


For example, stargate. It tells all the cast and then goes  Christopher Judge as Teal'c... why? It never said the name of the role for any other cast member..."
2683,2020-08-31 13:11:07,ijtb9g,"It has to do with the actor's contract with the show/production. Similarly, it's why peoples' names seem out of order on movie posters. Whoever has the biggest 'billing' goes first."

2686,2020-08-31 13:15:04,ijtb9g,The forehead gear is make-up that may interfere with the identity of the actor???

2708,2020-08-24 18:28:22,ifly1s,"Interesting post! Usually a little mystery to a person makes him or her so much more interesting. Even though you are faking some of the pictures, it is understandable since you are traveling to Asia on business trips, a 3 star or a 5 star doesn't matter compared to that you show a lifestyle of Asia that is exotic to America.

The more we assimilate into America, the more we lose ourselves, the more we play a caricature, the less interesting we become. Who would want an Asian person who is trying to be white when they can get a white person instead? Maybe whitewashed Asian females who think white guys are too extreme, but still toxic behavior.

American culture is bland and boring, so when a girl hear a guy is assimilating into it, she's like ""what the fuck is he doing"". There's a lot going on in Asia while America is stagnating. Taipei, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Beijing, Singapore, Tokyo, Seoul, Bangkok, Manila, Ho Chi Minh City, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpar, etc. Nightlife and lifestyle is beyond any city in America except NYC and LA. Because a vast swarth of America is BORING, no entertainment, people just playing video games and watching TV. People getting fat and isolated and on social media all day.

This is why Americans complain about rich people having no loyalty to America, but only to money. They are envious of the freedom to travel or connect to their roots. An Asian connecting roots to Asia is more interesting than a white person connecting roots to Europe because America is more similar to Europe than it is to Asia. 

You have to learn Chinese characters or Korean hangul, etc. A white person has to just learn the same alphabet in a different formation. 

But back on topic, who do these appeal to the most? American girls or Asian American girls or city girls or Asian girls from Asia?"

Some of them were actually cheating on their boyfriends (I checked to make sure their boyfriends weren't Asian, lol - gotta look out for the bros), some of them were in polyamorous setups where their boyfriend wasn't getting nearly as much sex as they were - that stuff seems real popular among the kids these days. 

Seems like a crazy time out there for a lotta young dudes these days, ""these hos ain't loyal"" as black folks say - or ""i'm gonna get kucked"" as white folks say (see: Falwell, Jerry). But hey, if I can take advantage of the situation, I will. Sounds like you're doing the same bro - good shit!"

I like that title too, but it ignores the very specific content in the post regarding Asian men's place in America vis a vis the racism we experience, which forms the crux of the whole argument. In fact, a close reading (or a reading of [part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/aznidentity/comments/igv65w/asian_american_men_and_dating_part_2_maintaining/) of this series) would reveal the impetus for this type of behavior lies in the racism prevalent in this society leaving Asian men with no reason to feel invested in any morality or sense of community when dealing with American society - certainly I don't particularly feel invested in anything other than my own self interest when it comes to America!

Far from being ""How to Trick and Take Advantage of Vulnerable Women"", a reading of Part 2 will show that my attitude eventually became more like ""How to Trick and Take Advantage of Vulnerable EVERYONE."" After all, given the marginalization Asian men face in society, why SHOULDN'T we just say fuck it and try to take advantage of everything?

1. Ateez, that growth. Can't wait to see the sales for the next comeback.
2. Stray Kids have experienced very solid growth. Glad for them because of their music slaps.
3. The Boyz have gotten a huge boost thanks to RTK. Selling 200k in a week is insane for them Hopefully, Pentagon gets the same boost as well. Kingdom when Mnet?
4. Treasure is selling crazy right now for a rookie group that is putting out single albums. I can bet Chapter 2 will pass Chapter 1 next week. Didn't expect that to happen because they were released so close together. They might reach the 200k club with Chapter 3.
5. ONF and Oneus had also impressive gains due to RTK."
2758,2020-10-03 14:27:31,j4fti3,"Random Thoughts & Observations:

The #1 album this month was actually a trot singer named Kim Hojoong who sold 532,127 units.  I don't put trot artists on this chart, but I thought someone might be interested in that information.

BTS continues to sell their back catalog.  EXO's back catalog has also made an appearance into the chart this month.  That's a nice surprise as an EXO-L.  This is also the first month that none of ATEEZ's back catalog has hit the chart this year (Fever made it, but that's it).

Taylor Swift also hit the chart again.

The top 100 ends this month with 861 units sold."

They will probably have the highest selling album on hanteo by a RBW group/artist soon enough and Lived is on course to be their first 100k+ selling album on gaon. Now imagine if RBW gave them 2/3 versions like the rest of the boy groups get instead of just 1. Ugh I hate that company sometimes.

2766,2020-10-03 15:04:07,j4fti3,"some thoughts over these numbers (girl groups only talk, sorry):

1. both Lovelyz and Fromis suffered severely from their over one year hiatus. Lovelyz numbers have basically regressed to their Now, We era and Fromis to From.9 era.
2. both Everglow and Rocket Punch have been setting them apart from other 2019 debuts (Itzy excluded, of course. they are on their own realm), with sales still (slowly) increasing. that is promising. 
3. Dreamcatcher keep increasing A LOT and is on the verge of reaching Gfriend (oh the irony) levels. they are proving people wrong, their sound and appeal is not so niche like we thought back at 2017.
4. despite me loving several of the debuts from 2020, gotta admit this year has been quite weak compared to 2019. this year only Weeekly started in that nice five digits level of sales. then there is an abyss till Woo!Ah!
5. and here we should talk about them. I gotta admit I forget about Woo!Ah! most of the time and so most people around here. but they actually achieved an impressive feat with those four thousand sales, for a small agency. most of the time these nugu debuts rover around one thousand, but they went way beyond that. iirc, from these previous years, only GWSN and Dreamnote achieved the same. and they did this in a harsh landscape affected by the pandemic and considerably less exposure than the other two.
6. Weki Meki numbers keep decreasing each comeback, which is unfortunate to say the least. but now also Nature sales took a big drop. this is worrisome to me. they seemed to be on a very good path from that nugudom level (one thousand sales) till a low mid tier level but despite all the buzz around Girls, their sales dropped to almost half. certainly the constant changes in lineup (I know, not something the producers can be blamed for when most of those were health related) are not helping here. their incoming comeback may be a defining moment for the group."

2787,2020-10-03 19:06:18,j4fti3,"Thank you for posting these. It's really interesting to see how well different groups sell. I'm always surprised by these charts. The groups that I thought would do well because they get talked about so much on reddit and even have high MV views, aren't selling as much as I thought they'd be selling...like damn, feeling bad for KARD and Pentagon right now.

On the flip side I'm impressed ab6ix is doing so well in album sales. I'm glad Nuest and Winner are selling well too. I hope they all release more music soon!"
2788,2020-10-03 19:09:52,j4fti3,">maybe some atinys can help me answer this but did the fandom size explode between jumping from 100k+ sales to 300k+ sales? 

I don't even know.  I wish someone would tell me.  Their sales for Fever have completely blown me over."
2789,2020-10-04 03:20:13,j4fti3,"Hi, atiny here!

ATEEZ had a 6 month long hiatus and pretty much doubled their following(from around 500k on twitter to finally breaking 1M!). And new stans discovering them through quarantine definitely helped! I also think stans having enough time to actually save money for the comeback has to do with it as well. The majority of ATEEZ‚Äôs comebacks have been around 2.5 months apart, with the exception being their comeback with Ep.3(title track Wave), which followed 6 month gap and resultingly saw an almost 10x increase in preorders. So I figure the wave of new stans who discovered them during hiatus + existing fans finally getting a good chunk of time to save money before a comeback again created a perfect storm. I won‚Äôt get my hopes up for a crazy jump in sales next comeback if it comes sooner rather than later but I hope to see more growth! (Psst.... if you‚Äôre ever tempted embrace your inner atiny... we‚Äôve got even more [San](https://youtu.be/FfcPJOcdx50) and [Seonghwa](https://youtu.be/c4o1IR-OgZ8) videos to live rent free in your head <3)"

Sadly, lol."
2791,2020-10-03 19:08:44,j4fti3,"N/p.  Glad that you like them.  :)

That probably would make readability a bit easier toward the end of the year, wouldn't it, huh?  :D  I don't know that it's too difficult, more that I will probably just forget to do it.  lol  

I really pared down the amount of work I need to do this year and while there still is quite a bit of handkeying, the calculations are all automagic now (it's gone from like a 4 hour process to an hour and a half - two hours depending on how many new albums there are).  That would be a last step piece and I'd be more likely to miss some because by that point they're in the reddit table format and my eyes are crossing.

That said, I think it's a good suggestion.  There would be issues where an album didn't chart in the month of its release, so it would never have a month of 'boldness,' but those are pretty rare (there's only two on this chart), so I don't think it'd be a huge deal.

I also just woke up from a nap, so I'm probably just rambling at this point.

Edit: I just tried doing this and it gets really fucky with the table formatting, so I don't know if it's going to work.  I'll try again later.  For now, I would recommend sorting that column so that all of the new releases are together."
2792,2020-10-03 18:46:53,j4fti3,"> Weki Meki numbers keep decreasing each comeback, which is unfortunate to say the least. but now also Nature sales took a big drop. this is worrisome to me. they seemed to be on a very good path from that nugudom level (one thousand sales) till a low mid tier level but despite all the buzz around Girls, their sales dropped to almost half. certainly the constant changes in lineup (I know, not something the producers can be blamed for when most of those were health related) are not helping here. their incoming comeback may be a defining moment for the group.

Weki Meki's sales decline is sad to see... they debuted with nearly 50k albums sold when album sales for girl groups weren't increasing yet and now they are selling less that Weeekly's debut."
2793,2020-10-03 16:29:05,j4fti3,"Regarding Nature, I feel single albums sell less than mini albums, and hence the drop off in sales. I hope they bounce back with another comeback as OT9, as they just got Sunshine back from her leg injury, but Saebom is out with Anemia/related health problem. Loha still out for health reasons and Aurora was on Youth With You in China. Now that DC Handong is back i hope Aurora comes back soon as well"
2794,2020-10-03 17:42:12,j4fti3,"My Little Society‚Äôs first week sales were actually slightly higher than Fun Factory‚Äôs, so I think it‚Äôs too early to say that fromis_9 has regressed. We‚Äôll have to see how My Little Society‚Äôs Gaon numbers stack up against Fun Factory‚Äôs 60k."

2799,2020-10-04 04:25:24,j4fti3,"I think that's going to largely vary by group.  Some groups have more domestic growth, others have more international growth.

Selling kpop physical albums has definitely increased over the past 5+ years, which is likely from a multitude of factors."
2800,2020-10-03 18:44:54,j4fti3,"well, this is only the Hanteo chart: In Gaon, Twice sold more than IZ\*ONE. Still, IZ*ONE have done well for themselves in this era of increased album sales for girl groups with the numbers getting more insane and with Blackpink set to smash all records when then numbers for the Album come in."
2801,2020-10-04 22:38:46,j4fti3,What month did it release?
2802,2020-10-03 19:10:37,j4fti3,Pentagon‚Äôs sales are pre-Road to Kingdom so they will probably see a significant increase in sales when they have their comeback this month like the rest of the groups that participated.
2803,2020-10-03 23:35:18,j4fti3,"yeah, the fandom definitely grew during the hiatus between Answer (January) and Fever."
2804,2020-10-04 04:46:56,j4fti3,Thank you for the info! Oh man another group that drops comebacks hella often (!!!) I can't even keep up with my ult skz lol (but yes... my inner fangirl will be checking out the rest of ateez' discography since i really enjoyed inception!) Cheers üòä
2805,2020-10-03 19:13:58,j4fti3,"Haha, I appreciate you considering my suggestion :) Or maybe all updates the current month could be bolder? If so you could just do ctrl+f on the last update date! I don‚Äôt know what would be easiest for you, but super cool that you made it more automatic!"
2806,2020-10-03 21:57:19,j4fti3,"I really hope New Rules can AT LEAST keep the same sales as Hide & Seek and don't drop to below ten thousand. because if this happens... I don't think Fantagio will have much incentive to keep this fast pace of releases as we have seen this year and they could very well sink in the same hole as groups like DIA and Momoland, who struggle nowadays to sell more than nugu groups."
2807,2020-10-03 17:22:13,j4fti3,"Yeah I don‚Äôt typically buy single albums, I only did with this one because I liked Girls so much"
2808,2020-10-03 21:51:33,j4fti3,"and that is exactly one of my main concerns: they seem to always be missing some members. when someone gets back to the group, another gets down. it is almost like the group is cursed. TT depending on when the comeback happens, we may have another 7 members comeback, this time without their main visual. 

if only fansigns were happening as usual, because these lesser groups are exactly the ones that rely more on fansign sales... the agency is making some money with these recent online events for overseas fans, so at least there is some money entering to allow them to invest in a well produced comeback."
2809,2020-10-03 21:43:25,j4fti3,"you have a point, but let's not forget Lovelyz first week sales were also pretty good but still..."
2810,2020-10-07 03:04:33,j4fti3,"Actually, it has. Gaon and Hanteo both already categorize ateez, txt, skz, and other groups as 4th gen, and have even made official 4th gen summary sales charts. Along with that, the literal Korean Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, names groups every year, and last year named Ateez as ""The Leaders of the Next Generation"", so yes, even Korea has pretty much-said 4th gen has started."
2811,2020-10-04 22:45:21,j4fti3,August! August 13th iirc
2812,2020-10-03 19:22:39,j4fti3,"So, I just tried to do it here, but the table formatting got in the way.  In the meantime, I'd recommend sorting the column, then you can have all of the updates in date of release order.  Or if you just want September's updates, you can sort the last column instead of the release date column.

It's not quite the same, but it's something at least."
2813,2020-10-04 22:43:45,j4fti3,"Replying again, friend, as I have discovered how to do this.

Unfortunately, it requires me to bold every cell individually.  That's.. a lot.  :(

I'll keep on the lookout in case an easy fix comes up.  In the meantime, I hope that the sorting works out okay for you."

What makes BLM and #OscarsSoWhite significant to Asian people is the evocation of racial consciousness.

For many, seeing a disenfranchised minority group expressing their grievances led to reexamining their own particularity in a society constructed for pink anglo men."
2820,2020-10-01 16:33:43,j316fi,"I'd probably be more specific and say Asian *male*.

Asian males don't get points for being a minority, even though we are, or for being female. And we also don't get white privilege. We don't get anything really, so any time we succeed you know it's all on our own."

But too often you have these bandwagon activists like that r/AsianAmerican mod at the China Mac rally trying to stop the momentum of an anti Asian racism protest and force everyone to focus on BLM, as if it wasn‚Äôt getting enough attention by the *mainstream* media.  So OP‚Äôs point still stands."
2823,2020-10-01 22:13:10,j316fi,"Well, Asian male privilege is like white privilege but with all the guilt and disadvantages and **none** of the benefits."

2834,2020-10-01 03:46:52,j2tnj0,Yes it is way overdue. No Steven Yeun isn't the one. Some say Henry Golding. I'm not sure he has all the tools. The wait continues.
2835,2020-10-01 04:07:39,j2tnj0,"Did you see Burning?  That ones amazing.

Anyway the answer is obviously yes we‚Äôre overdue and Yuen should be given more and bigger roles.  Name a SINGLE star leading man who is Asian and has been given movies in America.  (Never mind women, it‚Äôs even worse for women.)

Hollywood is racist, and it‚Äôs doubly bad for Asian and Black **women** and so forth.  Look up the articles of what they say about their experiences in casting and getting scripts.  We can all name 500 white man and women actors, less so black, even less so asian, especially women.

Yuen is awesome and the only reason he didn‚Äôt get more roles is that Hollywood is obsessed with white people (despite being politically liberal in other ways)."
2836,2020-09-30 21:09:49,j2tnj0,"I wish the guy every success because he has charm to burn and decent range, but I think he's in a position where he's made the jump from TV to cinema without too many problems and is getting some substantial character roles to immerse himself in. If I was in his position I wouldn't want any more fame because he's in demand without being too recognisable for day to day life to be annoying(although I might be underestimating the Walking Dead fanbase here)."
2837,2020-09-30 20:16:31,j2tnj0,This is dumb. Why does he have to be Asian? Why can‚Äôt we just have good actors making good movies? Why do you have to project your racism into art?

Although I am not OP, and I'm not sure if they are asking this question in this kind of manner, so I apologize if I am misinterpreting them, as a Korean American myself who is a massive film lover, I have found that whenever I am interested in finding a film about Asian Americans, it can be extremely difficult to come by.  The only Asian American centered films I can think of are The Farewell, Searching, Crazy Rich Asians, Harold and Kumar, Joy Luck Club, the Lara Jean films, and Better Luck Tomorrow, so there aren't very many.  You're definitely correct that it doesn't matter if an actor is specifically from a certain background, but positive representation can really go a long way, and it can be very fulfilling!  Steven Yeun has been in a lot of great roles, so I think OP is wondering if it is possible that we will see Steven Yeun in more and larger roles in the future.

2876,2020-09-29 10:47:20,j1uwi2,lol the OP has some mental issues. Check his post history.
2877,2020-09-29 10:45:42,j1uwi2,"Fucking dead LOL. truly delusional speaking with that big dick energy like WE‚ÄôRE the ones that have problems. Have to be troll shit , new acc , all comments are talking shit in AA subs."

2880,2020-09-29 10:48:38,j1uwi2,He talks robotic and deflect when questioned more specifically about his main point of his post.
2881,2020-09-29 10:47:17,j1uwi2,He tries to deflect and avoids to reason with.
2882,2020-09-29 10:59:52,j1uwi2,"One part is true, relatively new poster to Reddit.  Didn‚Äôt realize I was posting to different individuals, thought it was all Htin10 which entire delusional thread has now disappeared.

Big dick energy not mandatory.  But if you saw my resume, you‚Äôd shit a brick.

Point is very simple, stop repeating the same while expecting different results.  And if trajectory is Asian empowerment then Asians of every stripe must be accepted."
2883,2020-09-29 09:57:40,j1uwi2,"So you one of these who never thinks about what he is posting or just a clueless moron.  OK.  So according to your logic then, Asians should live in fear of being killed by yt and be like you, a ""feminine two-inch sissy wagecuck"", right?"
2884,2020-09-29 10:02:39,j1uwi2,"Got it, you are a LARP.  Hey whiteboy, what happened, did you lose the love of your life to an Asian bro?  Is that the reason you are cock obsessed?  Put your head back up your ass and breath, real men are chatting here."
2885,2020-09-29 11:00:34,j1uwi2,Grow up kid.
2886,2020-09-29 10:50:00,j1uwi2,He's probably having some kind of manic-depressive episode or schizophrenia.
2887,2020-09-29 10:50:05,j1uwi2,"You could tell that they‚Äôre completely deranged. If this isn‚Äôt troll, they need serious help."
2888,2020-09-29 11:03:19,j1uwi2,If you made any sense and not called Asians ‚Äúsmall dick should be scared to be killed by whites‚Äù then maybe you would have gotten more civil responses.

2890,2020-09-29 10:04:04,j1uwi2,"No, I am an Asian Man. ""Cock obsessed"" is a part of American culture."
2891,2020-09-29 11:37:55,j1uwi2," lol get some help, dude."
2892,2020-09-29 10:53:21,j1uwi2,"He could be acting; White People have good acting skills. His response seem to be calculated when ask to specify why he made the post, he simply deflect to avoid answering a hard question that could unveil who he is in terms of personality."
2893,2020-09-29 11:11:40,j1uwi2,your brain is not running efficiently. you must have a low IQ!
2894,2020-09-29 10:05:46,j1uwi2,"""America is a White Majority country"", ""would most likely be lock up in prison or seen as a low IQ sub-human who is not worthy to live with (mingle)"" and you think violence is intellectual, won't get us locked up or deemed low IQ sub0human nor worthy and killed?

Did you read the post or are you truly a moron?"
2895,2020-09-29 10:06:40,j1uwi2,You sure you are Asian?  Why are you then encouraging Asian Men handicap ourselves with ignorance and stupidity?
2896,2020-09-29 10:08:57,j1uwi2,"And judging by yyour chinglishee, you most likely don't know much about America nor this culture.  You are in the habit of criticizing on topics you are ignorant of?  How is that helpful to Asian brothers?"
2897,2020-09-29 11:39:20,j1uwi2,Grow up kid.
2898,2020-09-29 11:38:27,j1uwi2,"Probably both, he is not well."
2899,2020-09-29 11:18:03,j1uwi2,"Here we go again with your chinglishee.  Look here Clueless, again, best you don‚Äôt post about topics which you are ignorant of.  You make us failed with your moronic grandstanding."
2900,2020-09-29 10:20:23,j1uwi2,"So what is the point of your main post? So, what is your solution to unifying Asian American? So, what is your plan? Why is your main post mainly about complaining, when you offer no solutions."
2901,2020-09-29 11:40:09,j1uwi2," lol get some help, dude."
2902,2020-09-29 10:25:58,j1uwi2,"WTF is n the post makes you think ""I"" have the answer when I blatantly asked to stop idolizing people and focus on movements?  Maybe what the post is attempting to do is spark that conversation rather than continue to promote bucket of crabs mentality?"
2903,2020-09-29 11:45:18,j1uwi2,*pat on the head (hope that makes a difference). Grow up kid.
2904,2020-09-29 10:28:47,j1uwi2,Who is idolizing Trump and Pence? Spark the conversation about people who idolize Trump and Pence? Who are you venting against?
2905,2020-09-29 11:47:37,j1uwi2,"lol get some help, dude. Btw, again, I'm 31."
2906,2020-09-29 10:35:16,j1uwi2,"Crawl back under your blanket wumao.

STOP IDOLIZING.  Moron.  

Asians American culture SHOULD STOP IMPOSING STEREOTYPES OF OURSELVES.  We should have Trumps and not just impositions to be Pence, or whatever we want to be.  How the hell is having ""freedom"" so difficult to comprehend?

We need encourage each other to be exactly what we want to be instead of bucket of crabbing each other."
2907,2020-09-29 11:49:37,j1uwi2,"Again, communicate like you are 31.  Or not, but you‚Äôll be communicated to accordingly."

2909,2020-09-29 11:52:50,j1uwi2,"Yeah this gets old pretty quick, last one for your childish ass; grow up kid."
2910,2020-09-29 02:15:53,j1q2nr,Red dead redemption 2 would make a great movie in my opinion
2911,2020-09-29 02:20:02,j1q2nr,"Submission for alternatives for your Bioshock casting: 

Josh Brolin - Andrew Ryan 

Paul Giamatti / Willem Defoe - Peach Wilkins

Joel Edgerton / Cillian Murphy - Frank Fontaine

Adrian Brody - Steinman 

Noomi Repace - Tenenbaum"
2912,2020-09-29 02:21:07,j1q2nr,"Yeah, well, the movie interpretation is however the director or whomever sees fit. Case in point the atrocity that was Assassin's Creed. Tomb Raider wasn't terrible though, after the reboot, I rather liked it. I didn't even give Warcraft a try. Those are just a few recent examples.."
2913,2020-09-29 02:29:32,j1q2nr,Cant understand how overwatch hasnt made some type of movie or tv at this point
2914,2020-09-29 04:38:57,j1q2nr,"Karen Gillan would make an excellent main character for Horizon Zero Dawn. I'm still yet to play a lot of games on this list (I have like 50 I'll be getting some time after my PC this December so I've been watching a ton of gameplay on them) but yeah, she'd play it perfectly."
2915,2020-09-29 04:48:01,j1q2nr,Legacy of Kain would make a great series.
2916,2020-09-29 04:47:16,j1q2nr,Og metal gear solid ps1
2917,2020-09-29 18:02:33,j1q2nr,Most games have better writing than the movies.. No need to make them in sloppy Holywood shit
2918,2020-09-29 02:09:10,j1q2nr,Really hope the rumours of Netflix doing a Zelda movie are true
2919,2020-09-29 02:06:22,j1q2nr,The long road to Mordor by Frodo Faggins and Pippin Tookitintheass
2920,2020-09-29 02:34:01,j1q2nr,"I keep hearing about it these games. I havent played them because having parents who watched old westerns all the freaking time, i was in no way in any rush to play a western themed game lol. I will just have to check it out huh?"
2921,2020-09-29 02:27:59,j1q2nr,"I could see him Josh Brolin as Andrew Ryan. I picked Robert Downey Jr. as Andrew Ryan though because Andrew Ryan had a genius yet an ""ill fuck you up royally"" attitude that I felt was portrayed well by RDJ as Tony Stark. The rest of your picks, I could also see."
2922,2020-09-29 02:31:46,j1q2nr,I think what they did with the Assassins Creed was take the story line and tried to make an offshoot of it that was in no way relatable to the original storyline in the games. Now if they took the original games and made that into a story line with the first being obviously  the Altair and Desmond Miles story line then I think it would have been received better. IF they stuck to the storyline from the game
2923,2020-09-29 02:40:00,j1q2nr,Maybe one day they‚Äôll make enough animated shorts for the characters that they can stitch them all together to form a semi-coherent storyline
2924,2020-09-29 12:55:44,j1q2nr,That is on my list of games to play.
2925,2020-09-29 12:56:56,j1q2nr,I played it a bit when I got a bunch of PS1 games but I kept frustratingly getting killed. I need to revisit it
2926,2020-09-29 19:59:51,j1q2nr,Lol true but can you imagine the psychological thriller movie if Fallout or Bioshock was made into a movie and kept true to the game?
2927,2020-09-29 02:26:42,j1q2nr,I doubt it. Those rumors have existed forever and Nintendo probably won't choose to do another one until they see the results from the upcoming Illumination Mario movie
2928,2020-09-29 02:35:10,j1q2nr,It has a great story with lots of compelling characters
2929,2020-09-29 02:42:23,j1q2nr,at least we have fan made films to last us till then lol
2930,2020-09-30 03:40:14,j1q2nr,Ever seen new Holywood shiz keeping true to whatever source?
2931,2020-09-29 02:32:40,j1q2nr,Hold up....what do you mean ANOTHER one? Is a zelda movie already in existance?
2932,2020-09-30 03:43:14,j1q2nr,Lol touche. Depends on the director though. Band Of Brothers and Chernobyl were fairly accurate. Resident evil series is a pretty good series. I don't know how accurate it is to the games though.
2933,2020-09-29 02:37:00,j1q2nr,"Sorry, I meant Nintendo is already working on their first movie since 1993, the upcoming Mario movie, and I feel like they probably won't start on another movie (Zelda, Metroid) until they have gauged the success of Mario and whatnot.

It may eventually happen but if it does, I doubt it will be a Netflix original. That just doesn't seem very Nintendoish."
2934,2020-09-30 03:49:24,j1q2nr,How close.?..let me tell you. The name Alice is mentioned only once in RE games.
2935,2020-09-29 02:39:10,j1q2nr,As long as it isnt anything like the mario brothers movie back in the 80s. that was a Charlie Foxtrot and a half
2936,2020-09-30 03:51:15,j1q2nr,So basically they took the storyline (or lack therof) of Alice in the RE series and made it their own. Sounds like what they did with Assassin's creed movie
2937,2020-09-29 02:43:39,j1q2nr,I actually unironically love that movie and watched it the other day. It is such a weird drug trip.
2938,2020-09-30 03:55:41,j1q2nr,"Its utter botchery of the lore and timeline of the series. Monsters in wrong timelines, Jill replaced by some nobody and the series go downhill the more sequels it makes"
2939,2020-09-29 02:49:29,j1q2nr,"From what I read, there were a husband and wife director team that couldnt decide on anything in terms of the direction of the movie and I feel its like they decided to just make it up as they go. Its not an official movie but may I suggest on youtube Mario Warfare. Live action, hour long fan made film that is actually pretty decent."
2940,2020-09-30 03:57:33,j1q2nr,Damn. We need a gamer directed production company who won't listen to the big wigs to make these movies then.
2941,2020-09-30 03:59:01,j1q2nr,The first Silent Hill movie was ok.. Dont ask about it from fans of the game tho
2942,2020-09-30 04:00:33,j1q2nr,"Lol see here is the funny thing. I don't do horror genre at all unless its like a zombie ish type film. Saw silent hill, creeped me out and have never, and will never play the game"
2943,2020-09-30 04:03:08,j1q2nr,For sake they cant do comic books right let alone some time travel thing like Bioshock
2944,2020-09-26 08:38:47,j02in4,"

2945,2020-09-24 20:20:08,iz4wop,If Bill isnt Stephen Root youre doing it wrong
2946,2020-09-28 01:18:41,iz4wop,This is like the worst casting for KOTH imaginable üòÇ
2947,2020-09-25 01:49:46,iz4wop,Jason mamoa is not native American
2948,2020-09-26 01:27:27,iz4wop,I think I could play Bill because I'm fat and depressed
2949,2020-09-26 16:53:50,iz4wop,"The overall idea for the casting choices was overall fit or best embodiment of character to be precise. I think the show was so great and with this potential show, I believe its cast would need to be all well known stars that dont out shine each other and will fit the roles without over doing it."
2950,2020-09-25 01:47:17,iz4wop,Johnny Depp as Dale. He played Hunter S. Thompson in fear and loathing and Dale is basically based on him so I think Depp could really get into it.
2951,2020-09-25 17:32:49,iz4wop,I think we are going for best fit or embodiment not anything else.
2952,2020-09-26 14:33:04,iz4wop,That type of mind set leads like to shit like Johnny Depp is Tonto in The Lone Ranger
2953,2020-09-26 01:28:21,iz4wop,And Ken is not Laotian
2954,2020-09-26 16:43:24,iz4wop,That was just a shit move in casting.
2955,2020-09-22 21:18:55,ixw1eo,"he isn't ""defending"" asian culture so much as he is doing a caricature for western audiences. peter chao used to do this too and he went nowhere.

nigel is playing up a stereotypical comedic trope that asians are finicky with their food and are exasperated by hapless white people trying to make ""ethnic food"". This is also seen to a lesser extent in the american perception of how europeans (esp italians) approach ""authentic cooking"". 

many white americans enjoy watching this type of ""cultural critique"" because it helps them feel like they are better than the typical cultureless american who fumbles with international cuisine."
2956,2020-09-22 21:58:02,ixw1eo,Defend Asian culture? Then do it without the accent
2957,2020-09-22 21:04:37,ixw1eo,"his ""fake accent"" encourages other people to laugh at how Asian people speak

He is a disgrace"
2958,2020-09-22 23:15:56,ixw1eo,"He's not racist, but he's like a court jester for westerners. Non Asians are laughing the loudest when they watch Uncle Roger, and you can sure bet they're not laughing with us."
2959,2020-09-23 00:48:24,ixw1eo,"People who exaggerate the accent are fucking cringe, especially if that's pretty much the only comedy in his videos. It's embarrassing that he even calls himself a comedian"
2960,2020-09-22 21:36:28,ixw1eo,Uncle Roger is the new Uncle Tom
2961,2020-09-22 23:16:40,ixw1eo,I had no idea people thought he was a disgrace. I‚Äôve listened to his podcast and he is a proud Asian and isn‚Äôt afraid to roast white people. I don‚Äôt think what he‚Äôs doing is any different than George Lopez or even Martin Lawrence‚Äôs various characters on his old show.
2962,2020-09-23 15:09:10,ixw1eo,"Will his jokes and observation still work without the accent?  
If yes then he wouldn't need to do the accent right?  
If no then they are laughing at the accent and not the joke, then he should stop doing the accent."
2963,2020-09-23 07:01:02,ixw1eo,"I don't know man. I get what you're saying and I hope he really is doing his best defending Asian culture (I can't bear to watch his videos because of the exaggerated accent) but I just don't like that type of exposure, I guess. I'm not sure why I dislike the accent here and for other characters like Jimmy O Yang's character in Silicon Valley, but am okay with it for characters like Park Yu and Park Ing from old school JK Films."
2964,2020-11-20 01:26:03,ixw1eo,anytime theres an Asian famous for anything in western media its always either food or kung fu
2965,2020-09-22 22:00:56,ixw1eo,Ah those high horse videos left me bad impression of Italians
2966,2020-09-22 21:37:53,ixw1eo,"They are not laughing at his accent. He is playing the typical asian uncle we all have. If anything the people are laughing at those that appropriate and talk like they're the authority on asian culture. I do not see weakness in his persona. He owns the character and is in no way degrading it, and laughs at people that have no clue of asian culture."
2967,2020-09-23 01:54:20,ixw1eo,exactly this. he's pandering to the western audiences by using stereotypes.
2968,2020-09-22 21:49:51,ixw1eo,How is he Uncle Tom if he's actually roasting people making fun of asian culture???
2969,2020-09-22 23:36:17,ixw1eo,"Fuck George Lopez.  I used to be a fan and was looking forward to his talk show.  It finally aired and within the first 5 fucking minutes there was a bit where they ask some Asian tourist who clearly couldn't speak english if Asians really had small dicks.  Even without the racism, if by the first 5 minutes they're resorting to ancient stereotypes as ""jokes"" then it deserved to be canceled as quickly as it did."
2970,2020-10-31 16:07:05,ixw1eo,"It's not worth it. I agree with you, but right now reddit is in a weird place with this"
2971,2020-09-22 21:54:12,ixw1eo,he acts like a beta male
2972,2020-11-20 03:31:22,ixw1eo,Yeah fuck George Lopez. He even made fun of that blonde chick for kissing Jackie Chan in the movie The Spy Next Door. Fuck him and his insecure jealous ass.
2973,2020-09-22 23:52:10,ixw1eo,Ugh. I had no idea he told such a tired ass racist ‚Äújoke.‚Äù
2974,2020-09-21 19:13:24,ix72qa,He also talks about how this season will feature his worst guess ever. As if it can get any worse...
2975,2020-09-21 19:16:07,ix72qa,"I feel like the judges say this every season. But at the same time, it sounds more promising coming from Ken."
2976,2020-09-21 20:06:30,ix72qa,"Even though I also think this will be the best yet, I bet he can't say ""ehhh, I actually think Season 2 was better"" lol"
2977,2020-09-21 21:12:56,ix72qa,"S3 was too long, and if this season can make the format work, I'll be A-ok."
2978,2020-09-21 19:39:03,ix72qa,"I wonder if they got more professionals this year, since he says the talent is really stacked this season?"
2979,2020-09-21 21:07:34,ix72qa,What‚Äôs the shortened format? What did I miss?
2980,2020-09-22 02:20:59,ix72qa,Judge of show who is promoting said show says show is good. More at 11.
2981,2020-09-22 03:10:36,ix72qa,"I was an avid fan and thoroughly enjoyed this show, but after they kept Nick Cannon after his racist comments, I have since stopped watching."
2982,2020-09-23 07:03:10,ix72qa,Hopefully he doesn‚Äôt guess Ruth BG again. üò≥
2983,2020-09-21 19:36:25,ix72qa,Oh noooo
2984,2020-09-21 19:36:32,ix72qa,Yeah
2985,2020-09-21 20:12:24,ix72qa,"True, lmao."
2986,2020-09-21 21:21:51,ix72qa,Refer to my post further down in the feed.
2987,2020-09-22 03:02:58,ix72qa,And people like myself are eating it up. Effective promotion.
2988,2020-09-21 20:44:44,ix72qa,Oh no who is he going to guess this time
2989,2020-09-21 20:49:19,ix72qa,Maybe Lady Gaga lol
2990,2020-09-21 20:50:23,ix72qa,Or something worst
2991,2020-09-22 11:55:00,ix72qa,Gotta be Bjork! Lol
2992,2020-09-21 23:22:37,ix72qa,I‚Äôm calling it - he‚Äôs gonna guess Obama for somebody
2993,2020-09-21 20:50:54,ix72qa,Oh no
2994,2020-09-22 00:24:24,ix72qa,Probably
2995,2020-09-22 02:51:15,ix72qa,probably something like he guesses Obama and it‚Äôs actually Mitt Romney
2996,2020-09-21 20:51:28,ix72qa,We're in for a treat
2997,2020-09-22 12:32:04,ix72qa,Or Pierre Delecto
2998,2020-09-21 20:51:47,ix72qa,Yes
2999,2020-09-20 17:03:41,iwh32p,"Joel McHale was on Justin Long's podcast, Life Is Short, and it didn't sound like there was an end to episodes."
3000,2020-09-20 20:16:21,iwh32p,I‚Äôve been wondering the same. I love this podcast. It just suddenly stopped. Hadn‚Äôt heard anything and I was hoping someone had some info.
3001,2020-09-20 19:51:24,iwh32p,Listened to the first episode and couldn't really get into it. What were the rest of the episodes like?
3002,2020-09-20 20:52:40,iwh32p,Yeah I was wondering the same thing
3003,2020-09-20 23:02:36,iwh32p,My assumption is that they‚Äôve both gone back to work so they have less free time to do it.
3004,2020-11-12 21:41:31,iwh32p,"I just really wish they‚Äôd told us anything


Like if we knew it was on hiatus or over or in between seasons it wouldn‚Äôt be too bad but having no idea is really annoying"
3005,2020-09-20 22:27:06,iwh32p,"I sure hope not! They were a great source of entertainment during the darkest months of lockdown. There's been a bunch of comments on Joel's (and some on Ken's) Instagram posts saying ""We all miss the podcast!"", ""Will we get more podcast"" etc so they must know the demand is there."
3006,2020-09-24 21:39:14,iwh32p,"They‚Äôve been filming stuff (The Masked Singer, I Can Hear Your Voice, Card Sharks). They‚Äôll be back to podcasting at some point soon I assume. When Joel was on Justin Long‚Äôs podcast, he told him one of the reasons he came on was so he could get him to come on The Darkest Timeline as a guest."
3007,2021-02-24 15:55:04,iwh32p,Is it still on hiatus? Or over? Or is it back?
3008,2021-01-09 23:16:54,iwh32p,Justin Long has a podcast?  How am I just hearing about this.  You're the worst!
3009,2020-09-20 20:08:10,iwh32p,"Really awesome. The Covid talk could get a little much but that was usually only about 1/5 or 1/4 of the episode. 

What really makes the episodes are their interactions with the guests. Former cast members are almost all great. 

Of course, if you're a fan of communoty, it helps by miles."
3010,2020-09-20 23:19:28,iwh32p,"Meh there were a few interesting tidbits if you're a hardcore Community fan. 

I listened to the Allison Brie episode multiple times because I may have an unhealthy obsession with her. 

Otherwise, it's like so many other podcasts with two guys and no objective thinking everyone will be interested in their phone conversation."
3011,2020-09-20 20:13:22,iwh32p,Me too. It didn't catch me like the Scrub's re-watch Real Friends Fake Doctors did.
3012,2020-09-21 04:26:20,iwh32p,"> I listened to the Allison Brie episode multiple times because I may have an unhealthy obsession with her. 

Join the Legions friend. Episode 25 with her was really something else."
3013,2020-11-20 18:58:28,iwh32p,That one has more focus.
3014,2020-09-20 12:42:36,iw4ttm,D'elia and Callen were supposed to be in this but they had 'scheduling conflicts'.
3015,2020-09-20 01:52:12,iw4ttm,I cant wait to not watch this
3016,2020-09-20 02:41:52,iw4ttm,Bobby lee was supposed to play the part that Jimmy yang is.
3017,2020-09-20 03:17:00,iw4ttm,"When I see that O'Yang, Jeong and Peters are part of this,  I thought hmmm, why not Steve Byrne too.....googled it .....and saw  Steven Byrne is Director and wrote the screenplay.  

What's interesting is Ralphie from A Christmas Story (Peter Billingsley), and  Vince Vaughn are producers."
3018,2020-09-20 14:43:24,iw4ttm,Hey it‚Äôs jin yang
3019,2020-09-20 03:13:41,iw4ttm,"That fuckwit Jimmy Yang RE Shane Gillis
‚ÄúBut this is just plain racist. [It‚Äôs] truly disgusting,‚Äù

Fuck Jimmy Yang, and everything he is associated with.  Hard boycott for me on account of this stupid hack of a ‚Äúcomedian‚Äù"
3020,2020-09-20 01:36:38,iw4ttm,I see the name of one funny person.
3021,2020-09-20 17:44:14,iw4ttm,Looks terrible
3022,2020-09-20 01:40:53,iw4ttm,I wanna bang a rail of ketamine off Whitney's fart taco
3023,2020-09-20 13:53:20,iw4ttm,"Uh why so much hate on this guy

Movie looks fine. People saying bobby lee would be better are retarded, dudes funny but only in his own way, cant act for shit. Also hes 20 years older than this guy"
3024,2020-09-21 06:31:44,iw4ttm,critics are calling it everything from ‚Äúshit‚Äù to ‚Äúfucking shit‚Äù
3025,2020-09-20 01:58:57,iw4ttm,The fuck are y‚Äôall even here for if this movie doesn‚Äôt appeal to you lmao. This shit looks dope. The comedy store doc is gonna be sick as well.
3026,2020-09-20 03:16:05,iw4ttm,100% with you
3027,2020-09-21 23:05:51,iw4ttm,Yeah man Comedians lives are so crazy am I right ? If theirs one profession I don‚Äôt want to hear another second about it‚Äôs being a comedian
3028,2020-09-21 01:42:51,iw4ttm,Can‚Äôt wait for all of these comedians to promote this podcast on everyone‚Äôs podcast.
3029,2020-09-20 03:17:15,iw4ttm,"According to Chris Distefano, he‚Äôs playing the role of Corona Virus in the soon to come Covid 19 documentary."
3030,2020-09-22 01:13:24,iw4ttm,Would of watched it with Bobby.
3031,2020-09-20 03:15:34,iw4ttm,"That‚Äôs a shame, cause Jimmy Yang is a leftist pandering hack of a comedian, with no integrity.  I might have watched it with Bobby Lee, definitely avoiding it with Jimmy"
3032,2020-09-20 07:51:41,iw4ttm,"Ah that's why ol' Billy cubicle boss is in it then, they produce his show"
3033,2020-09-20 23:31:57,iw4ttm,"Lol damn, you probably hate him more than Shane does."
3034,2020-09-20 04:04:00,iw4ttm,Fuck Jimmy Yang. Not funny
3035,2020-09-21 23:09:03,iw4ttm,What have i missed? What is wrong with Jimmy?
3036,2020-09-22 01:12:53,iw4ttm,I'm onboard the fuck Jimmy train
3037,2020-09-21 13:34:40,iw4ttm,Lmao relax pal

3039,2020-09-20 03:21:55,iw4ttm,"Burr  is  like an unbeatable champ vs ~~the other names~~   virtually any other comedian out there today, take 1 or 2.......really not a fair comparison IMO. but  most of the names fair pretty well in movie/tv  stuff....tbh, some of my favorites like Community,  and Silicon Valley etc."
3040,2020-09-20 01:46:18,iw4ttm,"Everyone‚Äôs taste is different but you‚Äôre missing out on Neal Brennan if you don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs funny. Co creator of chappelle show, I think he wrote for Chris rock too. Great special on Netflix"

Congrats"
3042,2020-09-20 02:00:12,iw4ttm,Bc this is reddit and it‚Äôs a safe space... I‚Äôd cut myself to do lines of coke off a pile of her shit.
3043,2020-09-20 15:33:51,iw4ttm,"Yeah, the best role for him would be just playing himself, an erratic friend that will surprisingly give you good advise and a heart to heart conversation. He's not the best person for a young new comedian role"

3049,2020-09-20 01:44:02,iw4ttm,You got it.
3050,2020-09-20 06:59:36,iw4ttm,Never meddim doe
3051,2020-09-20 02:00:14,iw4ttm,His speech at Chappelle‚Äôs Mark Twain award ceremony was absolutely hilarious. Whole things on Netflix btw
3052,2020-09-20 01:41:46,iw4ttm,And his name isn‚Äôt on the list.  What‚Äôs your point?
3053,2020-09-20 04:27:09,iw4ttm,"It‚Äôs not a safe space, and you should be disgusted with yourself"
3054,2020-09-20 03:58:41,iw4ttm,"I mean, ok. But there are a million reasons why these comics were included and others weren‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a movie about getting started in comedy, featuring tons of great comics. I hate russel peters but there are a half dozen other people I love/respect in this movie. Also, jimmy yang fits the part because he‚Äôs still an up and comer and recently went through this shit. It‚Äôs a good movie for comedy, we don‚Äôt need to try and gatekeeper each other."
3055,2020-09-21 03:03:21,iw4ttm,"Negative.  Jimmy took shots at Gillis on Twitter, as a dawg, that puts Jimmy on my shit list, and anything he‚Äôs in, I‚Äôll avoid."
3056,2020-09-21 07:03:09,iw4ttm,"Hey hey, Neal Brennan deserves shout out too"
3057,2020-09-20 04:28:42,iw4ttm,Name fits.
3058,2020-09-21 12:38:01,iw4ttm,So what. What kind of person worries what people tweet. You‚Äôre an adult.
3059,2020-09-21 13:45:37,iw4ttm,"I don‚Äôt care about tweets, per se.  I avoid the work of people who prove themselves to be shit cunts.  This particular shit cunt, used a tweet to express that shit cuntness.   You‚Äôre an adult."
3060,2020-09-21 16:55:07,iw4ttm,You‚Äôre obsessing over nothing. You need a hobby.
3061,2020-09-22 00:21:53,iw4ttm,"I‚Äôm not really obsessing.  Just remembering.   Chances are I have more hobbies than you, so don‚Äôt assume you know a thing about me bro, other than the fact the Dawgs don‚Äôt forget."
3062,2020-09-19 01:59:55,ivi2b1,"Banning the platform does not remove the racist hate - it'll just migrate to another social media platform

**The TikTok ban is a bad thing because it is the bamboo ceiling in a nutshell**. An Asian founder created a globally influential app, and it was banned because he was Chinese. TikTok isn't tied with the CCP - it's fucking lip-syncing app for mostly teens. But that doesn't stop the US from making an excuse about national security and banning it.

And that's how they treat all of us. When we aren't successful, they look down on us. When we get successful, they'll make up any bullshit to have an excuse to bring us down. Think about this - **why is TikTok banned, when Facebook (with all its election manipulation, propagating literal white terrorist groups, hate speech, spying on its users, etc.) is allowed?**"
3063,2020-09-19 02:35:54,ivi2b1,"Of course it is bad thing.  Especially the way it was done.  If there is a security threat then expose it to the public and ban it.  If there is no security threat, then come up with a reasonable excuse for one's action.

But to go through the Trump 3 ring circus of negotiating with an US company, only to be banned anyways, is the most idiotic move.  The whole world is watching the US act like a bully now.  No one will trust doing business in the US.

It's basically Asian representation in highly selective college.  Do too well to earn too many seats and they (Whites) change the rules on you.  The US is really becoming a sh!tshow now."
3064,2020-09-19 04:51:40,ivi2b1,"They wouldn't ban Tiktok if it was from nother country. It's more white people being paranoid of Asians taking over. It's what you usually see Americans do. If they can't compete make up some lie about it. 

There also jealous because, we are killing the dance game too LOL"
3065,2020-09-19 01:06:35,ivi2b1,"It's definitely a bad thing. It helps to feed the overall narrative of Asians being underhanded, sneaky, and insidious fifth columns to western society."
3066,2020-09-19 09:01:24,ivi2b1,"If some British or white American kid made the app, people would be praising him and awarding him as the #1 tech entrepreneur on Yahoo Finance"
3067,2020-09-19 04:01:42,ivi2b1,"It's probably bad since TikTok was a platform that was good for AMs, but in some ways it's better to be hated than patronized. 

I've been thinking about how Sessue Hayakawa's heyday was during a time when Japan posed a rising threat to the West. 

And Gedde Watanabe's Asian minstrel Long Duk Dong came when no one took China seriously at all."
3068,2020-09-19 00:50:13,ivi2b1,"Yea, it's definitely racism, but getting hate is better than being ignored. They wouldn't go out of their way to make these videos if we weren't rising like we are."
3069,2020-09-19 02:53:58,ivi2b1,It's definitely a bad thing. One thing I notice about Tiktok is definitely more AM representation compared to other social media. For example the Chinese street fashion trends.
3070,2020-09-19 04:40:20,ivi2b1,"Basically Trumped up false charges of security risk and no opportunity for Tiktok to address the issue.  It is epitome of lawlessness.    When different standards are applied it definitely is against asians

I found the platform to be surprisingly good and create videos
Shouldnt be surprising why its so succesful.   There were a lot of unique K-pop, investment .   Hopefully the millions of users vote out GOP"
3071,2020-09-19 01:35:43,ivi2b1,The ban's only in America but I uninstalled it cuz it was addicting.  It was annoying to see the Racist Jokes from Chans.
3072,2020-09-19 07:37:16,ivi2b1,"I see where you are coming from. However, would being ignored be better? Indian Americans don‚Äôt face the same amount of racism as Asian males, and they rise in companies like Google and Microsoft much more so. Anti India hate is also nowhere near anti China"
3073,2020-09-19 18:34:42,ivi2b1,"You are right that Indian Americans do rise more but I don't think racism is the only factor. There are cultural and language factors, for example they aren't taught to keep their heads down like we are and if they're immigrants they don't suffer the same language barrier"
3074,2020-09-18 00:02:47,iuv10t,"I think Chang got a lot of time to shine towards the end. Bear down for midterms, the Karate Kid play, ham girl..."
3075,2020-09-18 02:31:02,iuv10t,Arizona backwards is still Arizona
3076,2020-09-18 00:15:53,iuv10t,I think he was good in moderation but definitely at his funniest as Se√±or Chang
3077,2020-09-18 01:11:49,iuv10t,"He had his moments and I liked him best in Seasons 1 and 6 but I would've loved the show just as much without him, he brings some humor but isn't really integral to the heart of the show. The only exception may be for Heroic Origins since he brought everyone together but even then it could have worked with the Dean as well."
3078,2020-09-18 00:01:47,iuv10t,Least fave character easily
3079,2020-09-18 01:15:33,iuv10t,"I came to community on day one, because ""that guy from Derrick Comedy"" was going to be on a major network show.  I knew I was sticking around for good in episode two when I heard: ""I am a Spanish genius!!""  Frankly, season one Chang was Best Chang."
3080,2020-09-17 23:59:53,iuv10t,That‚Äôs funny because he‚Äôs actually my least favorite character. I don‚Äôt mind the actor in everything else i‚Äôve seen but his character in community was very annoying imo. Has his moments though.
3081,2020-09-18 01:16:38,iuv10t,"He's absolutely hilarious in the show, but I don't think he does. Ken does amazing when he's given a good script and character and great acting and characters to work off of. But if you watch his stand up show... he's not that funny on his own."
3082,2020-09-18 02:04:42,iuv10t,They could have given him classroom scenes as a math teacher
3083,2020-09-18 04:12:30,iuv10t,"Chang worked best when he had mystery to him. Every action, choice he made in season 1 just made him more entertaining. But when they stripped it all away, he became a cartoon. He became a one-dimensional character whose job was to pop up and be random. And by season 4 he was more akin to a lost puppy than El Tigre."
3084,2020-09-18 02:49:25,iuv10t,"Chang was certainly integral to the show, but Jeung always had one foot out the door. He was working on The Hangover movies and half a dozen other projects the whole time. When he did his stand up special last year, he talked about The Hangover for 20 minutes and didn't mention Community once."
3085,2020-09-18 03:12:09,iuv10t,"I think his character worked best when he was more of a flawed human with bouts of chaos than a straight up ridiculous lunatic.

Season 3's ridiculous security guard tyrant plot was a bit much, but seeing him as a professor and as The Karate Kid was fantastic."
3086,2020-09-18 07:46:20,iuv10t,It's a palomino!
3087,2020-09-18 16:29:33,iuv10t,Agreed
3088,2020-09-18 02:30:18,iuv10t,Yeah s1 s2 chang
3089,2020-09-18 03:29:05,iuv10t,"I would actually put him a notch above Shirley. I laughed more at what he did, but rarely ever laughed at Shirley."
3090,2020-09-18 11:49:31,iuv10t,Makes sense.  Hangover gave him his big break.
3091,2020-09-18 23:37:32,iuv10t,He seems pretty tight with the cast so I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs all true. A lot more people have seen Hangover so it‚Äôs a much more accessible reference for his stand up crowd
3092,2020-09-18 03:27:20,iuv10t,Agreed.
3093,2020-09-18 16:48:09,iuv10t,"Absolutely, I think the character jumped the shark for a while after he faked having amnesia.   Gotta hand it to Jeff for not being fooled like everyone else though, I was always suspicious as well."
3094,2020-09-18 13:20:08,iuv10t,"The only big Shirley laugh I got the whole show was Abed doing an impression of Shirley.  You hear me, two voice?"
3095,2020-09-18 03:32:45,iuv10t,"Shirley was kind of a break even, not good or bad. Jeong overacts and tries way too hard IIMO, just annoying"
3096,2020-09-18 19:21:55,iuv10t,Season 6 was very good for him
3097,2020-09-19 03:13:50,iuv10t,"Jeff was eventually fooled though, but I have to admit that Chang was *very* convincing. Which is why I wasn't surprised that he ended up being a good actor in S6."
3098,2020-09-18 12:35:38,iutyhg,Wow the direction and cinematography looks like the most stale Hallmark shit I‚Äôve seen in a while. Looks like every shot is just on a tripod and way too close to everyone.
3099,2020-09-17 22:42:10,iutyhg,I love everyone in this movie. I'll check it out. Cedric the Entertainer is a really really really nice guy. He was a guest speaker at a health Expo I put together and he took the time to sit and chat with me before the event started. Very down to earth

3101,2020-10-17 02:57:57,iutyhg,Really looking forward to this one. Steve Byrne is great and the cast has some people that seem perfect for this project. I've been watching the documentary about the Comedy Store recently and it got me pumped up for a movie about comedy so the timing is perfect.
3102,2020-09-21 18:43:55,iutyhg,"well, i'd like to say you're wrong. our cinematographer Eric Edwards has worked with Gus Van Zandt, Judd Apatow and myself. he did a fantastic job. the club and the film look better than any representation i've seen onscreen in a comedy club. maybe you would be lucky enough to compose some piano for a hallmark film?"
3103,2020-09-18 13:09:49,iutyhg,It looks like they went with whatever existing lighting is available on set. Would have been much better if they just did handheld. At least it would look cheap on purpose.
3104,2020-09-18 14:18:36,iutyhg,Also has maybe the greatest crowd work ever filmed in The Original Kong‚Äôs of Comedy
3105,2020-10-16 12:16:42,iutyhg,"Yeah I don't know what this dude thinks he saw. Cinematography looks fine. Great appearance on YMH btw, that's how I found this."
3106,2020-10-20 05:36:15,iutyhg,"I like the movie but the acting, editing and continuity is quite awful."

3112,2020-09-11 17:31:10,iqpl54,"He channelled his rage at his wife's plight into the character, he said. One monologue that wound up being cut from the film but used as a DVD outtake turned into a pure rant that Jeong sees now he was doing to unburden himself.

It got less great because the funny people left.  Maybe we could survive losing Chevy Chase, Pierce mostly just said offensive things to top someone else‚Äôs joke, and you can only have SO many ‚Äúwhy do we keep hanging out with you when you keep disappointing us‚Äù conversations.  But Don Glover leaving ruined it. Not only do we lose Troy, but Abed without Troy balancing him out just gets fucking weird.  By the time we lost Yvette Nicole Brown (and like half the supporting cast, Jonathan Banks and John Oliver are big losses too) I can‚Äôt even care.

3149,2020-09-10 15:30:14,iq3lw1,"I agree with most of your points.  I enjoyed most of seasons 5 and 6 as episodes but not so much as seasons.  Basically the feeling of community went away - it did not feel like people having different experiences in their time together like the early episodes, but individual stories being written with recurring characters.

I think the basic problem is the requirement to lay the groundwork before pay off.  In the early seasons the show was mostly grounded in their classes, school, etc.  So the weird episodes like the pillow fort had the rest of the show as framework and grounding.  Those episodes were great - but because they were part of the larger show.

As seasons went on it became more about the strange episodes and the grounding was lost."

The ending is unique just like the show , as you said it's ending is not like other shows but an ending like that would just feel so un community like .The show  was always different from most sitcoms and a normal sitcomy end would feel misplaced and a disservice to the fans."

Season 6 was ok, I liked the bittersweet ending though.

KPOP is all fun and games til you start stanning unpopular groups huh"
3170,2020-11-08 05:13:31,jpyas2,"Thoughts:

1) does anyone know what happened with iKON? I Decide is at 38k, but didn‚Äôt they use to sell around 100k? I haven‚Äôt kept up with them in a while, but I thought after B.I‚Äôs departure and everything the group went through, the fandom would support them even more. 

2) ATEEZ, SKZ and TXT have broken into the 300ks. I wonder what next year has in store. I‚Äôm also pleasantly surprised at how high TBZ sold (280k). Treasure‚Äôs doing great too, nearing 200k a few months into debut. 

3) I‚Äôm happy that my fave from X1, Seungyoun/Woodz, is thriving solo (120k). yay for Produce bringing attention to idols from less popular groups and companies. (yay for the RTK boost for many newer bgs as well.)

4) nice to see groups with mostly international fandoms like LOONA and Dreamcatcher experience sales increases. CLC and Everglow too, though on a lesser scale.

5) out of ggs, the ones who can sell over 100k are BP, Twice, RV, IZ*ONE, MMM, ITZY and (G)I-DLE. after that, I think GFriend and WJSN come closest. those groups, plus OMG (who just had their breakthrough hit recently) and APink (who are an older group), are basically who most kpop fans consider the top 10 among current active ggs.

6) SUJU‚Äôs longevity never fails to impress me"
3171,2020-11-07 21:55:25,jpyas2,So proud of Dreamcatcher's growth! I think their next comeback is going to break their personal records once again!

3173,2020-11-07 21:19:31,jpyas2,"Wow, The Boyz really got a crazy boost from RTK, much moreso than any other competitor.

Great to see TXT selling so well - they're now the best selling currently existing (sorry X1!) 4th gen boy group.

It's impressive that Wonho is selling just over half of what Monsta X does, I hope he gets to work with them in some capacity again someday.

Seungyoun selling just behind Cravity and more than Wooseok is also super impressive, and if you'd told me a year ago that both he and Han Seungwoo would well outsell Kim Yohan's group by a country mile I would have called you a liar, though I think that speaks more to how mishandled WEi's debut was.

Edit: I actually did the RTK maths. Here's the breakdown for pre-RTK sales vs post-RTK sales for each group:

||Pre-RTK|Post-RTK|%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|The Boyz|85810|259574|302%|
|Pentagon|48997|82466|168%|
|Oneus|36040|85810|238%|
|Verivery|26871|33705|125%|
|TOO|26642|49356|185%|
|Golden Child|21042|69275|329%|
|ONF|20463|66894|327%|

So even though The Boyz didn't technically have the biggest boost percentage-wise - Golden Child did - they had the best sales beforehand so it made a bigger difference.

Edit: one more table! Here is how all the post-X1 releases are doing, sorted by final rank in the group. Caveat: DRIPPIN debuted 3 days before the end of the October tracking period so to be fairer I've taken their sales as of the 6th of November, not the 31st of October like this post,  and Dongpyo hasn't debuted yet.

||Debuted as|Highest sales|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Kim Yohan|WEi|34,869|
|Kim Wooseok|Solo|105,498|
|Han Seungwoo|Solo|73,564|
|Song Hyeongjun|Cravity|131,376|
|Cho Seungyoun|Woodz|124,247|
|Son Dongpyo|N/A|N/A|
|Lee Hangyul|H&D|23,488|
|Nam Dohyon|H&D|23,488|
|Cha Junho|DRIPPIN|30,956|

DOUBLE EDIT: Seeing fromis_9 nearing 50k with My Little Society is amazing as well! The fact that Even Of Day surpassed the sales for the OT5 mini is fairly surprising, but both albums have great songs.

I am still surprised Verivery never got the RtK bump. Golden Child, on the other hand, has maintained their RtK momentum and it is so great to see ~70k sales.

A.C.E's numbers are quite good, but personally whilst the music was great... the physical album itself was so disappointing. That photoshoot was a work of genius, wish the packaging had been given more thought."

* congrats dreamcatacher for breaking 50K!
* Why does Baek Yerin sell more than other female soloists like chungha or bolbbagan or even sejeong? I'm just curious if it's the general public or her fandom buying the albums...?
* Impressive numbers for cravity in their first year, i see it where they have their monsta x sunbaes like how TXT have their BTS sunbaes very impressive fandoms
* I wonder how Drippin's trajectory will compare to golcha and to infinite; they all start similarly but differ in their trajectories the latter 2
* I wonder if DAY6 will break 100k, they've been very steady at 50k+ each album
* Oh no why are jbj95 and weki meki sales declining :( I always have a soft spot for all my pd101 alumni (cries at X1 still outselling some groups)
* Yay Kard's showing some growth (those video fancalls contributing a lot maybe?)
* proud of oneus' growth these boys deserve it with how talented each member is
* that pentagon growth yay!
* Hoping SKZ breaks 400k if not 500k on their next release (which always catches me off guard b/c by that time I finally have figured out my favs on their last release and they're like SURPRISE HERE'S MORE)
* Dang SJ-KRY still kicking at 100k+ 15years into their career I'm glad the korean public loves their voices/songs
* As always, respect for the twice and izone queens, selling as much if not more than some bg's
* YooA doing v impressive for her solo
* Question for SM fans, how long do you think SM is gonna keep SuperM on and various NCT subnits? It seems the NCT with alll the members sell the best and superM's sales arent the best but was the purpose of superM for sales or to spearhead going into the west? Makes me wonder from  a business standpoint whether letting the members go back to their og group would technically make more money but superM is a lab experiment of sorts..."

The 10k sales for *Red Punch* have been in the main column since it dropped in [Feb](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/fd4hm2/kpop_numbers_thread_hanteo_sales_february_2020/). Then in [August](https://reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/in21uf/kpop_numbers_thread_hanteo_sales_august_2020/) 20k was added to the 2020+prior column and it's been that way since. Just wondering where that 20k came from, and why it wasn't just added to the current total instead.  

(super late) edit: Adding some more about RoPun, I'll say the 10k jump between *Red Punch* and *Blue Punch* is nice to see. I think their popularity will only continue to grow in the coming years. Also I'm really curious as to when/how they'll make their Japan debut. After watching Juri's vlogs it's clear to me that Woollim will try to capitalize on her existing fanbase there, especially considering how dedicated the other members are to learning Japanese."

BTS didn't start off big, but eventually got there. EXID were not having great successes until a random fancam blew up. You never know what can happen!

It may be easier to stan Big 3 groups because of their guaranteed success, but it's also nice to stan smaller groups that may some day get the recognition they deserve!"

Dreamcatcher has been on an upward trajectory since Deja Vu but 2020 has been massive for them, especially this last comeback. Their recent online concert had 12k tickets sold as well.

I know to fans of bigger groups, 34k - 54k may not seem like much, but to a group that A)had to re-debut and B)uses a non-traditional concept that isn't as popular with domestic fans, it is huge. And things like having a real live rock band backing them up for their latest concert are big milestones.

Knocking on wood here but it's pretty clear Dreamcatcher and Dreamcatcher Company, even in these times, will have financial stability for the near future."

Probably nothing except continue giving them quality songs (seriously, their stuff is so good!) and not give up on them.

Also keeping their older albums in print might be helpful if they ever do manage to blow up lol."
3203,2020-11-08 03:53:46,jpyas2,"The Boyz are kind interesting, because there was a post a few weeks back that pointed out that they were selling ~130K for their first few albums, but then X1 debuted and their fandom (and sales) were just decimated. So, while RTK *obviously* helped, I'd say it worked in tandem with the quick demise of X1.     
I had no idea ONF sales were so low previously; tbh, I would have liked to see them even higher, considering how spectacularly I thought they did (maybe if the album wasn't just a jewel case...).    
VeriVery numbers are upsetting - I don't know why they didn't get the bump the others did; I thought their ""treatment"" on the show was similar to Oneus, and really thought they carved a nice niche.    
Speaking of Oneus, I could have sworn I saw a celebratory post about them hitting 100K in sales? Maybe it was Gaon.    
Lastly, for Pentagon, the cut-off date is only a little over two weeks into their promos, I think they're at at least 89K as of now - don't know how much that impacts the %."
3204,2020-11-08 00:38:58,jpyas2,"I'm honestly so confused what's up with Verivery's post-RTK figures. I watched the show and I can't really put my finger on why they didn't get as big a bump as anyone else. I feel like they got screwed on screentime but they weren't the only ones, and I saw *way* more negativity about Pentagon's performances than Verivery's- maybe you could accuse them of not standing out much but their Aladdin-themed stage was received pretty well (it came 3rd that round). I guess maybe that was outweighed by other factors like the editing & narratives over the course of the show and choices of concept.

Considering Golcha got such a big bump I wonder if it's actually better to get eliminated early, creating a sympathetic narrative of being cheated, than to scrape by near the bottom for the whole show."

Aww, X1 babies, I'm a bit left behind because since the disband I couldn't bear myself to see anything related to them, and I'm gonna be honest I thought all of them would do A LOT worse, like, no more than 15000 for the solos and no more than 25000 for the groups, but I'm so happy I was wrong!

I'm happy that they have Woollim's backing and I'm so proud that they had such an exciting debut, they're all so sweet, but I'm surprised WEi haven't been doing too well. I suppose it was the long wait killing Yohan's hype + I'm not sure if Donghan's (and to a certain extent Daehyeon) solo fanbases have really supported this, but I really hope WEi keep improving because they have so much potential."

They sold 101k album units in their [first week](https://www.billboard.com/charts/billboard-200/2020-10-10) in the US. They're probably going to rack up a couple thousand more sales on Hanteo as well - the delayed release was five days before the end of the October tracking period."

This might be a hot take but I think that Korea puts out some of the best R&B and Hip Hop vibes right now and I think it's just something that Koreans like, rightfully so because it's dope

Colde (Offonoff), Crush, Baek Yerin, Jimmy Brown, Sam Kim, Heize, the list goes on, Baek Yerin by far sells the most albums though, her most recent album was like 90% English so there might be an international influence there"
3221,2020-11-08 01:30:57,jpyas2,"Re: SuperM  
   
I have a tinfoil hat theory regarding the group, which again is very out there, but it just never made sense to me that they added Baek, Taemin and Kai, and to a lesser extent Taeyong into the same group if they are basically always going to be missing a member to the military service at this point. And they only been around a year, so it's not like they had 2+ years of touring and etc.  
  
My guess is SM is pulling strings with Baek to not enlist yet, because they knew the S.Korean Govt would talk about some kind of resolution in the some idols being excempt from Military service. Which is why they added those 3 in this group to try and make them ""international successful idols"" ala BTS and hopefully have them be exempt since the juniors in that group pretty much already are due to their specific circumstances. That would allow Baek/Kai to be available for solo/exo duties and Taemin for the inevitable Shinee comeback.  The main reason I even think that is cause, well, it's $M, and also because they have always had some serious expensive promo behind them which they had already prooved they weren't big sellers so it just doesn't make sense they keep prioritizing them so much.  
  
But anyway, the more likely and less crazy idea was that they perhaps intended for them to be more of a ""tour"" group. But due to the pandemic that wasn't possible. Since even if you don't like SuperM, you might still pay whatever price to go see some of them due to their other activies as it's less likely they would tour solo and go to your country. Kinda like the Music Bank tours.   
  
Anyway, idk how they will adapt to the inevitable Baek enlisting, followed by Taemin and then Kai.  And seems odd they wouldn't plan ahead for it if they intended the group to last more than 1 year.  
  
Also, I saw an international interview where they were asked for their plans for the rest of the year and the next one and Baek was so optimistic about going on tour next year (2021), and I was like hmmm of all people him saying that? haha ofc he could just be casually saying it but he seemed so confident given he has very limited time."

3230,2020-11-08 06:55:23,jpyas2,I think Elris is surviving through the concert scene. Back when they were not releasing music last year they went on a large number of concerts and festivals. There was even a recurring joke that they were an adoptive SM group since they always somehow end up in lineups with predominately-SM artists.
3231,2020-11-08 02:51:29,jpyas2,"Outside of Visual_9 and some other rare groups, Elris really got an insanely attractive quintet in Sohee, Yukyung (even more so with that new shory hair), Bella (even more so when her hair was a bit shorter) and Hyeseong.

Add to that a good discography, too."

Verivery on the other hand focused only on Kangmin being the most adorable smol human being and Dongheon being a great leader (which are true) - but I feel did not highlight their strengths? Beautiful-x was quite underwhelming tbh. They are such sweet boys and Kangmin's birthday vlive is still my go-to whenever I am feeling down - it hurts a bit they never got that RtK bump... :("

3235,2020-11-07 21:41:05,jpyas2,"I think their debut and especially Yohan's solo debut just took way, way too long. It's been ten months since X1 disbanded. He was so popular during X1, they should have tried to capitalise on that in early 2020 like Wooseok, Cravity etc. I get why they took so long - OUI is a small company, they were affected by the pandemic, the shock disbandment of X1 gave them way less time to prepare, 1THE9 was also affected by the pandemic and they ended up delaying for Yongha and Junseo, the cancellation of School 2020 was unfortunate for Yohan, but still, they should have put out his solo a bit earlier than August or even done more solos for him. They could have potentially debuted WEi more immediately after 1THE9 disbanded or pulled a Yeonjung/WJSN with them. I also think there was some boycotting from Yohan's fans on the k-side because they wanted him to stay solo, which meant that it was mostly Donghan's fans buying."

I will say that it's been a little quieter with their more recent comebacks now that they are coming back after getting caught up the Produce scandal.  Could be people moved on to newer shinies or folks aren't afraid the group is going to fall apart now, so it's not as present of mind."
3244,2020-11-08 04:48:21,jpyas2,"RE: Baek Yerin, she‚Äôs actually a lot more popular in Korea than people think. She has a great indie, ‚Äòfree spirited but still feminine‚Äô vibe that girls especially love. Go on YouTube and you‚Äôll find tons of makeup tutorials and fashion ‚Äòget the looks‚Äô for her since Korean women seem to love her style (it‚Äôs very girly, but still with a side of grunge, somewhat like Courtney Love?). She also has tattoos and generally seems very direct with haters and antis. I think female fans really love that attitude. And since female fans buy a lot more albums than men do, that translates to album sales."
3245,2020-11-08 02:35:46,jpyas2,"EXO enlisting is huge for SM - millions in album sales, streaming, and touring revenue (pandemic aside) is wiped out with their enlistment. The schedule of the members going in is planned well in advance, based around maximizing revenue for the company and their own plans. Regardless of SuperM‚Äôs existence, Baekhyun isn‚Äôt going to enlist until he absolutely has to because he can *sell* - as evidenced by his own numbers. 
 
People always float this idea of idols getting an exemption for their successful music careers but time and time again it never comes. Even if the option was available, it would be reputation suicide. Baekhyun, who still has a great reputation in Korea, isn‚Äôt going to throw that away for some touring revenue - or for SM. 

SuperM provides 2 things to SM - milk 4 fandoms at once around the world, filling venues that some of their individual groups might not be able to book themselves, and bolster their partnership with Capitol Records in their westward expansion. Look at what Republic is doing with JYPE - the goal isn‚Äôt to have Twice be the face of their western expansion, but to solidify the partnership into deals with the rest of their groups. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Aespa gets announced as a Capitol Records group sooner the later. Capitol opened the doors for 127‚Äôs rapid western expansion before SuperM and they definitely pulled their weight with SuperM‚Äôs world tour + debut promo, although the Super One promo was definitely cheaper/lacking. Despite 3 MV‚Äôs and the variety content, the budget for this comeback was worlds away from Jopping + the debut promos. The fact that they couldn‚Äôt travel and couldn‚Äôt tour was always going to bite them in the ass - as ticket sales were important for them last time. 

Tbh I don‚Äôt think SuperM was going to change their enlistment-era tactics. Baekhyun has already done 2 solo releases and is apparently preparing a third (with rumors of a solo concert, which at this point would probably be online only). Kai‚Äôs solo debut is approaching. On the other side, Taemin is going to be free for SHINee‚Äôs Q1 2021 comeback - they‚Äôre just waiting on Minho at this point. 

SuperM was always going to be largely based around the touring, and I think the lack of a proper tour changed their strategy entirely. Regardless of the pandemic, SM still has an obligation to meet the requirements of the Capitol Records deal - and almost certainly had to put an album out this year. Moving forward, I doubt they can do much before Baekhyun enlists by May (at the latest, could be earlier). I imagine the group will be on pause anyway since it‚Äôs unlikely touring will be back in a meaningful way until late next year."
3246,2020-11-08 02:04:36,jpyas2,"Interesting, I feel like the korean public wouldnt look favorably on exemptions which could hugely negatively impact the group (case in point [Yoo Seung-jun](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoo_Seung-jun)).. though I definitely do not doubt $M's power and influence to make something like that happen!

There *are* some groups out there that manage to find very talented members and then either through company mismanagement or no interest they just flop. It‚Äôs such a waste for the members who have great performance skills. Like Pristin, SPEED, Gugudan etc.

I guess you're right about Verivery though; I also feel like there was a lot of emphasis on their synchronised dancing, but perhaps that just doesn't impress much in a show like this where a lot of the groups were going all out on performance and spectacle."
3251,2020-11-08 09:13:34,jpyas2,"I think part of what helped Golcha as well is that people generally considered them to be in the top 3 while they were there.

Even for this cb alone, they didn't even open up video calls for fans to bulk-buy albums until later on.

It's honestly a miracle they got like three cbs this year - they are not strong both physically and digitally, and they neither have a strong domestic fandom like say GFriend nor international fandom like CLC, Dreamcatcher and Loona."

3266,2020-11-08 03:19:23,jpyas2,"Yeah I don't see exemption happening. Even if they had the option I don't think it'd be smart for them to take it. BTS is gonna be (relatively) shortterm but they gotta live (and work) in SK for possibly 50+ years.

South Koreans are really sensitive about the rich/powerful using their money and power to escape responsibilities and rules like other South Koreans (and with good reason imo considering their history and culture). I mean in the west people would be pissed at someone like Elon Musk not paying taxes even if he does make billions for the US(not a perfect comparison but...). The only thing I feel MIGHT be possible (and this very unlikely) would be them being allowed to postpone it for 2 extra years.

The age for enlistment was changed from 30 to 28 relatively recently so if BTS were to be nominated for a Grammy I think the General public might be more accepting of postponing their enlistment by another 2 years. That being said I feel it would be special one-time thing rather than a new law. I feel like it wouldn't be possible to base Korean enlistment laws around a US award show.

But yeah it's way more likely that they'll just enlist. Probably this will be their last CB, too bad that this is pretty much the only CB in their whole careers that they'll be doing as 6 members instead of 7."

Fun fact, in that scene he's reading a collection of short stories titled 'The Terminal Beach', and actually, the first short story in that book is called 'End-Game'. Which is an interesting tidbit because the title of the film is also called Endgame."

  This shows very well accross cultures as cultures as well.  If you brought an Asian person in who is fluent in English and made them take an IQ test that was written for western English speakers they often won't do as well as they would had they taken an IQ tests that was written from someone within their own culture.

What we are discussing is how accurate that score actually is.  Just because it has known biases and inaccuracies doesn't mean it isn't at least somewhat effective in measuring intelligence.  

  The things we are discussing has been proven to add variability into scores, but we aren't talking about someone of an Einstein quality being given a score thats comparable to that of someone with a severe learning disability.  With that being said though, it does bring me to my next point.   Albert Einstein is famously quoted ""If you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will spend its entire life thinking ita stupid"".  There are a multitude of different types of intelligence while IQ focuses mostly on your ability to identify patterns.  If you're much better at identifying patterns than the person next to you, that doesn't immediately mean you are more intelligent.  Thats simply one platform of intelligence but the only one IQ measures.  

  Other forms of intelligence are much more difficult to quantity, and have therfore been mostly forgotten about.   Essentially at the end of the day the point to take away is this, a high IQ almost definitely means you're incredibly intelligent, but a low one doesn't make you stupid."

Yes, this is exactly what I meant.  It‚Äôs like those Garfield cartoons where they make it look like Jon is completely alone and is talking to himself.  But a lot of sitcoms (including Friends and TBBT) are filmed in front of a live audience.  There is often a combo of laugh tracks and real applause/laughter that they have to wait to subside."

3585,2020-10-31 22:10:01,jl98j4,"Maybe he didn't enjoy being a doctor.  How can you fault a guy for chasing a passion? Or money?  Either way, I won't judge unless there's something that literally tells us that he's a self-loathing asian.

Explain, how he is acting like a dog for white masters?

His wife is asian.  It's not like he sold out and got a white woman."

3608,2020-10-29 00:54:18,jk0d8o,Shang Chi has had zero marketing
3609,2020-10-29 03:37:08,jk0d8o,"I dunno, I don't think the Shang Chi marketing has started up yet, marvel's always been quite hush hush while filming so you don't even have any behind the scene photos or clips to drive up the hype. Plus people are unfamiliar with Shang Chi over all and the Mandarin is a racist caricature in the comics so maybe people are waiting to see how it turns out? 

Shang Chi also is suppose to be a ringer for Bruce Lee and Simu Liu doesn't really look like him? But I read Simu Liu used to be a stuntman so his background seems to be an okay fit. There's also the fact that Simu Liu doesn't have any movie or shows shown in China so there's no established fan base to help hype up his casting in the first place.

Plus Iron Man 2 had that two version clusterfuck as well (the one shown in China had all scenes with Chinese actors that felt tacked on, the Chinese actors didn't show up in the international version at all). So I think it's all just wait and see rather than no hype at the moment."
3610,2020-10-29 10:37:40,jk0d8o,"Its quite normal before a new superhero is introduced , guardians was the biggest example of that"
3611,2020-10-29 01:22:54,jk0d8o,"Shang Chi is a F-List hero* that nobody will probably know about until they see the film itself, so it's hard to get excited about something most regular non-movie or comic savvy people have heard of yet.

*I know the argument has been made that ""So was X and Y character"" but between Captain America, Deadpool, Black Panther or even the TV characters like the Inhumans or the Defenders, Shang Chi is legitimately an full on obscure character that hasn't been featured in many comic books, merchandise, clothing, brand marketing and action figures except for incredibly sporadic, brief or limited appearances."
3612,2020-10-29 10:40:42,jk0d8o,"Yes this is an asian superhero movie but marvel is not doing to break the asian records or to please them . It is just another feather of marvel like black panther and marvel doesn't depend only on asian markets even though its an asian centric film just like black panther did 
So marvel will be fine even if it does normal box office in every market"
3613,2020-10-29 23:36:27,jk0d8o,"Awkwafina is a terrible choice... I really don't think her looks/demeanour appeals to east Asians at all. I mean,s he does fine as supporting comedy actor like in Jamanji, but seriously to have her cast as the main female role? Ouch"
3614,2020-10-29 01:23:25,jk0d8o,"When they release the first trailer, the hype will go from zero to Sen."
3615,2020-10-29 01:35:23,jk0d8o,"American movies, even when about other cultures or countries, tend to be wholy self-centered so that might be a point of contention. Might as well watch a truly American movie than one that pretends to be about your part of the world, you got a thousand local movies for that. 

Marvel's Black Panther for example for all it's talk about Africa really had nothing to do with that part of the world beyond some aesthetic choices. It was almost insulting how little that movie was interested in African issues."
3616,2020-10-29 02:14:33,jk0d8o,"The main marketing point so far is Asian superhero playing kungfu, not so much to hype about"
3617,2020-10-29 07:12:09,jk0d8o,"Wait, they are excited for Dune?"
3618,2020-10-29 12:19:03,jk0d8o,"Chang-Chi's standalone comic ended in 1983 and the character didn't get another long running standalone till 2017! after a 34 year gap.

In that 34 year long gap 26 issues where released across 6 limited series."
3619,2020-10-29 14:46:01,jk0d8o,"East Asian don't really care about hollywood movies with asian characters. Japan (since 1950's), Hong Kong, Korea already had well developed movie industry for decades. Black Panther marketing is not going to work in this region. Movie is still going to do well because it is MCU but not because they had Asian characters."
3620,2020-10-29 01:03:57,jk0d8o,"I think you pretty much mentioned it. People in china no that its a movie meant to pander to them so to speak. 1) the problem is that simu and awkwafina do not appeal to chinese beauty standards. 2) chinese don't care about representation. to america a majority asian cast is celebrated, in china its tuesday. 3) shang chi is a martial artist, do you know how many martial artist movies/tv china produces? alot. at least characters like thor, iron man, CAP are unique. 4) characters history. the western raised asian is good guy, eastern raised is bad. theres probably more, but can't think of any.

i think Shangi chi will not perform nearly is as well as BP, but i think it will perform like an average MCU film(~600 mil). It will perform similar to crazy rich. One question i have for the audience. **if Shang-chi performs like antman and fails to blowup like BP/capt marvel. will that be seen as a failure?** I personally think so."
3621,2020-10-29 10:51:48,jk0d8o,I also think the hype for chi is low but we'll see when the trailer arrive. I can see it doing 700-800M range
3622,2020-10-29 03:24:49,jk0d8o,true. i've always said that BP was made for african americans. it simply used african aesthetics.
3623,2020-10-29 01:55:45,jk0d8o,"
>**if Shang-chi performs like antman and fails to blowup like BP/capt marvel. will that be seen as a failure?** I personally think so.

Sure, a DC_cinematic fanatic should judge that a Marvel movie is a failure even if it makes big profit.

Warner and DC would literally kill to have their D-list superhero movie get $600 million.

Just like when their extremely popular A-list DC villain Harley Quinn get that $600 million, right?

Oh wait...."
3624,2020-10-29 04:07:56,jk0d8o,"African-Americans = Americans, black Americans if race is relevant to the discussion. Precisely because they mostly have no relation to Africa except far-away origin that term has always been weird for us from outside of the US, borderline offensive imo.
I of course get what you mean, just saying."

Costumed celebrities will be joined on stage by masked partners and back-up dancers, as they perform a series of dances together; spanning from hip-hop to salsa, jazz to tap dancing and more. When it comes to dance styles, the sky is the limit. Each week, a series of clues will be sprinkled throughout packages, costumes and routines, leading the panelists one step closer to figuring out which famous faces are freestyling behind the masks. 

>Between all of the celebrity competitors on the show, they've amassed more than 38 million albums sold worldwide, 20 Emmy¬Æ Award wins, 20 Grammy¬Æ Award nominations, 10 World Dancing titles, five New York Times Best-Selling Author titles, four Olympic gold medals and three Broadway show appearances."

That being said, I hope it's not the 'let down' Masked Singer is, at least so far.  Each year they promote better and higher profile celebrities, but so far that hasn't seemed to be the case.  It seems to either be 'B or C listers' or people who, were an A list star, but years ago...."

3684,2020-10-18 06:23:52,jdaku0,Interesting. I feel like the only issue with the Presidential theory is that the cohorts won't always be consistent in length due to the shorter terms of some presidents (e.g. John F. Kennedy or Gerald Ford).
3685,2020-10-19 23:01:54,jdaku0,Great list!  The only thing I can really point out is that Britney Spears is missing from the 1981 list.  She is definitely a Millennial icon.
3686,2020-10-18 05:33:37,jdaku0,Good ranges btw
3687,2020-10-18 13:29:47,jdaku0,Yeah true.
3688,2021-01-10 01:18:53,jdaku0,I think it was about actors/actresses and not musicians so that's why Britney Spears wasn't on there.
3689,2020-10-18 06:09:38,jdaku0,Thanks
3690,2021-01-10 01:50:13,jdaku0,"Justin Timberlake is on the list.  While he has some acting credits under his belt, I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs better known as a musician than an actor."
3691,2021-01-10 01:54:08,jdaku0,"He's both but yeah, he's more known as a musician. Maybe it's because he was in a lot of movies in the late 2000s/early 2010s so that's why he was put on the list, I guess."
3692,2021-01-10 03:26:40,jdaku0,"I think Britney has done some acting as well.  Wasn‚Äôt she part of the Mickey Mouse Club before she became a pop singer?  And she‚Äôs done a few acting gigs since her entry to pop stardom as well, but yeah her filmography is very limited, so she‚Äôs not well known for acting."
3693,2021-01-10 03:31:13,jdaku0,"I guess but in the Mickey Mouse Club, weren't they still singing and dancing? And I think she was in All That but as a pop star, not an actress. She probably has done a few acting gigs but not many people know her other than as a musician. It's like saying that Beyonce was an actress (which is actually more believable as she was in a few legit acting gigs). Ironically, they are both 39 and born in 1981."
3694,2021-01-10 03:33:30,jdaku0,"Granted, Britney isn‚Äôt known for her acting.  And I can‚Äôt say what she did on the Mickey Mouse Club; my house didn‚Äôt have the Disney channel though back then I wished it did (I still love Disney and Disney+ is one of my favorite steaming apps)."
3695,2021-01-10 03:43:06,jdaku0,"Yeah, I like Disney+. I think it's because when Disney Channel was in its earlier years from 1983-1996, basically the 80s and 90s when you were growing up, it was a premium channel so most families couldn't afford, and it didn't become affordable until 1996ish when you were in high school and the Mickey Mouse Club was over."
3696,2021-01-10 03:55:07,jdaku0,"Yeah it was a premium channel when I was a kid.  We did have Disney Afternoons on a broadcast channel though.  Once in a while Disney Channel would be free for a weekend and my
Mom would record movies and shows for my siblings and me.  The only problem was during these free weekends the shows and movies would have the 1-800 subscription number scrolling across the bottom of the screen.  By the time Disney became part of the regular cable lineup I had outgrown their programming, although I would have still watched all the Disney shows from my youth for old times‚Äô sake, but Disney wasn‚Äôt showing any of those programs - just the new stuff I was too old for."
3697,2021-01-10 04:05:45,jdaku0,"Yeah, that's true. By the time they were finally free, they brought a lot of new things like DCOMs and shows that were popular during the early-mid 90's probably ceased production, like the Mickey Mouse Club."
3698,2021-01-10 04:12:00,jdaku0,"One thing I do like about Disney+ (besides the Star Wars content) is that I can go back and watch all the Disney shows and movies I did grow up with.  Yes, even though I may be too old for them at my age now, I‚Äôll still watch my old shows from time to time.  I don‚Äôt watch those programs that came out after my time, but I will watch old episodes of Talespin, Goof Troop, or even Recess which was technically out when I was a teen but I still watched it for a bit.  Granted, most of what I watch is geared for adults but deep down I can still be a kid at heart.  That‚Äôs part of why I love having Disney+."
3699,2021-01-10 04:18:56,jdaku0,"I loved watching Disney+ during quarantine for most of 2020 but I started getting out of it. I'll try and get back on it tho. I will admit, I was watching Netflix this past week for 17 Again, Easy A, and most importantly Cobra Kai (IMO one of the greatest shows in recent history)."
3700,2021-01-10 19:14:56,jdaku0,"I haven‚Äôt seen Cobra Kai yet.  I hear it‚Äôs really good.  Mainly what I watch is YouTube, though honestly I don‚Äôt really watch a lot of tv.  My tv is always on but usually more for background noise than video entertainment.  Still, when I do watch tv it is usually YouTube.  Quarantine didn‚Äôt really change my life much.  I‚Äôm an essential worker, so I still leave the house for work.  I never was much of a bar fly or club dancer, so staying home rather than going out doesn‚Äôt really bother me.  My life is pretty much the same as it was before the pandemic except for wearing masks in public.  As far as staying home, I‚Äôm usually engaged in my hobbies or projects that keep me busy.  However, one thing I like about streaming is all the options I have today because though I‚Äôm not a big tv watcher, when I do watch tv I like to have options.  I‚Äôd say Disney+, YouTube, Pluto TV, and Netflix are the ones I use most, along with Amazon Prime and Hulu.  I bundle Hulu and Disney, and i share Hulu and Netflix with my family members."
3701,2021-01-10 20:12:16,jdaku0,"That's interesting. When you do have the free time, please check out that show. Especially if you watched the Karate Kid series from the 80's, it will make a lot more sense and even better to watch."
3702,2020-10-16 21:36:02,jcgyse,I am still fascinated by his attempts to play peacemaker for Bobby Lee and Ken Jeong
3703,2020-10-16 23:41:29,jcgqxv,"I listened, thanks for post. Sexkarate is a paranoid idiot, I'm sure he misses seeing the 100th video of a dude posting a heckler's reaction followed by no original content.

I may still check the movie out, it was way under the radar, but I saw his interview on another podcast, I think YMH. He is definitely on a publicity tour for his dream project, not sure what got up the other guy's pussy."
3704,2020-10-17 10:49:04,jcgqxv,"Saw it. Loved it. Probably the best representation of the world of comedy from a comic's perspective. Steve Byrne is a real grinder. Dude is on the road (pre covid) every single week. This movie really shows the shitty world that we love. Bombing, early morning radio, weird club managers, and getting tugged in different directions as you try to pursue the art. It's a sick job we were drawn to and this movie gives the public a slice of the reality. Happy he made this. It's real and there's a lot of lessons that are taught that used to only be revealed if you lived the life. 5 stars. And fuck the guy below giving a review without seeing it. Go watch it then."

3707,2020-10-16 20:09:07,jcgqxv,"Talented cast but this looks... underwhelming. If not painful. Safe and predictable humor made for the fans of comedy who post pictures of their pumpkin spiced lattes on Instagram. 

There will likely be a few good one-liners in there with all these comics involved but I‚Äôll rely on you guys to shine a light on them. I‚Äôm gonna pass."
3708,2020-10-17 00:07:50,jcgqxv,"Thanks for the comment! 

With the majority of theaters shut down it‚Äôs tough for smaller films to get any attention. I talk to a lot of indie directors and it‚Äôs been a blessing and a curse. On the plus side, less competition from bigger releases and more direct to digital for easier distribution. But without theaters and festivals, it‚Äôs just much tougher to build any buzz."
3709,2020-10-16 20:54:01,jcgqxv,He's the main character.
3710,2020-10-16 23:42:52,jcgqxv,"saw in another podcast that he was a good age for the main (YMH), plus he has been a comic for years, so he likely could hit the beats more naturaly."
3711,2020-10-16 20:11:30,jcgqxv,I really liked it.  Granted I haven't done stand up but some of the comics involved and Steve himself said it was the most accurate movie about the Stand Up experience.  It has some painful parts but it also has a lot of heart.
3712,2020-10-17 10:50:30,jcgqxv,You're way off. Watch it.

3737,2020-10-13 00:37:36,ja0jap,"Nora from Queens has Bowen Yang as Awkwafina's cousin and BD Wong as her dad. In a vacuum I don't find a problem with that, but it kinda plays up to the ""we have to cast only gay Asian males"" thing.

Jacob Batalon plays Ned, Spiderman's best friend in the new MCU spiderman movies. I think he's a good dude and all but gaddamn he doesn't make us look good. Also weird ""coincidence"" in Spiderman Far From Home, they make the main rival in Spiderman's love triangle with MJ a good looking Asian guy that ends up getting the girl taken from him."
3738,2020-10-13 01:47:26,ja0jap,There's barely any Asian male actors in Hollywood movies. None of them have lead roles.
3739,2020-10-13 03:40:29,ja0jap,"AMs on screen now are either played by hapas, are gay, or are dead."
3740,2020-10-13 05:22:27,ja0jap,"The gentleman where henry golding was cast in was an absolute shitshow for asian representation.  Obvious tropes about chinese people being sneaky and slimy criminals versus the more ‚Äúhonorable‚Äù main characters mobster.  In a imagined scene, Henry golding gets his literal balls shot and screams like a woman.  And in the ending he gets caught with his pants down trying to rape a woman.  Not to mention all the other asian characters being hopelessly incompetent gangsters."
3741,2020-10-13 04:30:17,ja0jap,"Just stop watching Western shows man, it‚Äôs filled with hyper idealized (and unrealistic) body image/behavioral standards that not only do they stir up insecurities in POC, they also make the whites insecure of themselves."

3743,2020-10-13 14:22:52,ja0jap,"Hmmm...with all of our cynicism, this just gets posted. 

This trailer actually made me tear up a little bit. Positive portrayal of an Asian Man in a leading Romantic role.

3744,2020-10-13 14:33:19,ja0jap,"True, there's been progress but I think they've just moved the target. 

People are a lot more media savvy these days. They're not going to stand for a cartoon. This is especially true when there are a lot more Chinese in American universities and more people know Asians.

Hollywood is still going to try their best to limit Asian men though, by subtly undermining their appeal to 90% of the population (if the stat that 1 in 10 people are gay holds true.)

Look at the number of gay roles for Asian men compared to straight ones.

\- As you mention, ""Alex Landi playing a masculine gay guy in Grey's Anatomy""

\- Henry Golding's latest movie, ‚ÄúMonsoon‚Äù, has him as a gay male. 

\- They changed John Cho‚Äôs Sulu to a gay male

\- They had Godfrey Gao in ‚ÄúThe Mortal Instruments‚Äù as a gay male.

So that's four of the top Asian men in entertainment, and they've all had gay roles. Are there even four white men who have had gay roles?

Then there's 

\- Star Wars: Squadrons has a revolutionary Asian male lead character (and he's a gay male)

And you yourself mention these, which are still recent:

Ken Jeong in the Hangover (last one was in 2013)

Matthew Moy playing an embarrasing goofy guy on 2 Broke Girls (series ended in 2017)"
3745,2020-10-13 05:02:59,ja0jap,"There's a lot of positive Asian male characters in movies/tv now. Even more slated in the next two years.

The one thing I would really like to see is an Asian male protagonist in one of the more massively culturally relevant shows. Something with a big budget and promotion. Like at the popularity of Euphoria or You. Those ones really matter. I think it's cool they've started to create Asian-Americans as that high school jock role though in some of these shows, i.e. 13 Reasons Why. I think someone mentioned Joe Seo in Kobra Kai is like that but I haven't watched it. I assume part of this is due to pushback of the nerd stereotype.

That and a blockbuster film not having to do with martial arts. I think this will be coming when Amadeus Cho (most likely) happens.

In 2020 though, social media celebrities are bigger than mainstream media celebrities outside of a select few. Hollywood as a whole industry is very influential globally so it's important to advocate for changes, but I'm more interested in social media dynamics at this point. Entire country is turning and it's happening through social media. It is the main influence that will determine what the next generation of writers write."
3746,2020-10-13 00:07:01,ja0jap,You answered your own question in your last paragraph...
3747,2020-10-13 08:22:39,ja0jap,"obvious counter to this would be all the movies that normalize violence against Asian men while humiliating us. you know, the ones that have the white/non-Asian hero killing hordes of evil nameless Asian men without breaking a sweat (because we're so weak, of course) and then following up by fucking Asian women"
3748,2020-10-13 02:20:44,ja0jap,"Yeah, I like the show but that was bothersome."

3750,2020-10-13 02:31:28,ja0jap,"Tbf Nora from Queens also has Dumbfoundead, who is not gay or effeminate in any way. He‚Äôs probably the most masculine character on the show."

3752,2020-10-13 00:09:08,ja0jap,There might be movies or TV shows I'm not aware of though.
3753,2020-10-13 02:32:00,ja0jap,I don‚Äôt get why they introduced a character who was not even in the comics only to kill him off immediately. So brutal.
3754,2020-10-13 03:20:04,ja0jap,Yeah that's true. Much respect to him. I know Awkwafina and him are super close so that prolly helped him land the role. I don't wanna be a downer but I wonder if he woulda gotten the role of he wasn't friends with the lead star and they woulda just casted an asexual nerdy Asian guy or something.
3755,2020-10-13 00:11:27,ja0jap,There is that and your awareness of Jimmy O Yang...but somehow you choose to rationalise the latter away
3756,2020-10-13 03:59:41,ja0jap,you realize a lot of the comic book loser types are still the loser types but they just find jobs being writers and this is what you get. Racist losers but in positions of power
3757,2020-10-13 02:38:20,ja0jap,"The fact he wasn't in the comics makes it that much worse, damn.  Seems  like they are pushing a specific narrative..."

3759,2020-10-13 03:27:14,ja0jap,He probably wouldn‚Äôt have gotten his role or any role if he wasn‚Äôt friends with Awkwafina. That‚Äôs kind of how the entertainment business works - nobody would get any role if they weren‚Äôt friends or cousins or neighbours with someone more famous than they were. Nepotism 101.

As teens üòé, we get üâê a lot üçë of very üëå weird üòï, random üé∞, and borderline üò∂ pedo üë¥üèºüëßüèªüë¶üèª messages ‚úâ.

If they don‚Äôt then idk ü§î block üö´ them. Well üò§üòØ here we go üèÉ:   
  
1 üéÑ. I üëÅüôåüèª thoroughly üòîüòñ enjoy üíØ the act üé≠ of cutting üî™ off üì¥ a mans üë¶ penis üçÜüëΩ, cutting ‚úÇ it in half üíÄ with my mouth üëÑ, and then shoving ‚ùÑ these two ‚úå halves 1Ô∏è‚É£‚ûó2Ô∏è‚É£ down ‚¨á their eye üëÄ sockets üòâ.

I hate pedophiles as much as anyone, but why is it always targeted at men?? A man did this, he did that.
Yet when a woman does it, she gets a insanity plea and is free to go.



I don't care if I offend anyone but why is it always in reference to men??? I think women are also capable of pedophilia, no?? Or are they a bunch of heavenly angels that can't do wrong??"

4084,2020-12-12 13:26:43,kbk3hb,"Ants are attracted to cum and I can prove it. 

I sit down at my desk and open my porn folder. I scroll through all the weak nonsense such as hentai and loli until I get to my futa furry toddler nugget porn. I start jerking it and within two minutes I was covered in my own seed. 

The speed at which I wanked made me incredibly tired so I laid down and went to sleep, hoping to dream of My Little Pony and their tight pussies. 

I suddenly wake up and am very itchy. I look down in horror to see hundreds of little ants crawling over me, eating the sweet, sweet semen. The feeling of their little feet walking all over me was enough to make me bust again. This time, however, they noticed the source of the sweet nectar. They began forming lines and burrowing themselves into my foreskin. I arched my back and moaned loudly as they nibbled the head of my penis. 

They began to go into my urethra and make little ant nests in the residue. I was thrashing on my bed because I wanted to nut again but I couldn't. My mom walks in to see this and she screams in horror. As soon as I turn my head to look, I busted the hottest, fattest nut I ever have. An explosion of ants rocket out of my penis and all over the floor.

My mom runs out in terror and I begin to finally clean up. Just the thought of what happened sent chills down my spine. I picked the few ants that were still alive and kept them in a jar. I couldn't wait to do it again."

4097,2020-12-12 16:45:17,kbk3hb,Yeah I know that is the best option. I was hoping people would understand that this is all a joke but oh well

4100,2020-12-12 16:30:42,kbk3hb,Yeah..... I know.

4110,2020-12-12 14:55:31,kbk3hb,Yeah I thought people would realize this isn‚Äôt meant to be taken seriously......... maybe not tho. Probably should‚Äôve said something but tbh I didn‚Äôt think this would get any traction so I didn‚Äôt bother.

4112,2020-12-12 16:46:16,kbk3hb,The entire joke is to make you cringe and weird you out. So..... thanks?
4113,2020-12-12 16:35:16,kbk3hb,*me who was hoping for it to be cringe:* yay
4114,2020-12-12 16:41:10,kbk3hb,Yeah I know. That‚Äôs why you just block and report them without responding. I think people are taking this admittedly bad joke way too seriously

4120,2020-12-12 16:29:05,kbk3hb,Yeah I figured that people would understand this was all a joke. I guess not. Obviously just block them.

4137,2020-12-12 16:20:03,kbk3hb,I never said otherwise...... this is a joke. It is supposed to be so absurd that it‚Äôs funny.
4138,2020-12-12 16:12:00,kbk3hb,Yeah I‚Äôm gonna change it. After looking at it imma be honest I feel weird about it. Sorry.
4139,2020-12-12 16:22:43,kbk3hb,I. Was. Making. A. Joke. This is obviously not supposed to be taken seriously. And maybe I was going for absurdist cringe humor...... if I failed then oh well.

I think he was amazing for every season except for when he was being the dictator and trying to get the group expelled. I just thought that was annoying in my opinion. 

But my all time favorite scenes will be when he was trying to get the Spanish class to leave and kept say ‚ÄúAdi√≥s‚Äù and when he goes ‚ÄúF... F minus.‚Äù

Edit: I‚Äôm realizing from this thread that my favorite season of Chang is season 1 when he‚Äôs a professor. I would argue he had the best lines then."

When Abed gives his big ""Winger"" style speech at the end of Remedial Chaos Theory and says ""A raft held together by those few, rare, beautiful things that we know to be predictable.""

And Britta jumps in with

""Ropes. Vines. Vines?"" And then shouts at the group ""Let him finish!""

The ""let him finish"" is a running gag though. Abed also says it's when Jeff suggests a ghost stole Annie's pen.

And during Chang's speech at Garrett's wedding

Chang: You want him to take one for this crappy team?

Unknown guest: Let him finish!

Chang: They were letting me finish, sir.

4367,2020-12-08 06:23:28,k8uzx3,"Yeah, there's an episode with Bobby and Ken. Ken gives Bobby a shout out for giving him his first job on Mad TV. 

Unfortunately, this was during Bobby's relapse. You can see him out of it, but still being hilarious. 


If you look up on YouTube Ken and Bobby have a few MadTV sketches together and some with Stevee"

I tried this out a few different ways last night cause I had some extra time on my hands and it even seems ‚Äúthank you for being a bad‚Äù isn‚Äôt too common."
4369,2020-12-08 09:07:30,k8uzx3,"In that case, I wonder if Ken keeps tabs on Bobby‚Äôs career like Bobby does to Ken, because the way he said it seemed very deliberate. Either a homage to Bad Friends or he‚Äôs going to try to coin it for his show hah. 

I haven‚Äôt seen the Ken sketches with those guys but I do love the whack-a-mole bit with Bob and Steve."

4372,2020-12-07 13:37:50,k7tjud,"I'm sure it will have the same format as TMS. It will me a mix of some celebrities who are known for their dancing, and some who aren't. I dont think they will have problems finding contestants. Dancing with stars has been running for 29 seasons and they haven't run out of contestants. It's easier to learn how to dance than sing."
4373,2021-01-25 06:55:48,k7tjud,Omg no I didn‚Äôt! üòÜ fake like they‚Äôre animated!?
4374,2020-12-07 15:06:06,k7tjud,Agreed - but I think this will be MUCH harder to guess if they never speak. Maybe there will be more clues?
4375,2020-12-07 20:35:18,k7tjud,"I just hope that it‚Äôs not like DWTS where 1/3 of the contestants have had dancing as a part of their lives from an early age, another 1/3 have had their dancing as a part of their celebrity career & the final 1/3 come from NO dancing background. 

ü§îüí≠ahhhh to remember how AMAZING early seasons of DWTS were when there was maybe 1 or 2 previously trained dancers among the celebrity cast."
4376,2021-01-25 15:19:55,k7tjud,"Yup!! I was shocked. Like obviously some parts are stock reactions that they recorded from people. But when the cameras zoom out to show the ""audience"" facing the stage, all those heads are fake. And if they zoom out even farther and show ""people* standing up, it's CGI. So I think they did a good job matching the real human reactions that they prerecorded with the animation. Because it took me awhile to see it lollll"

StayC doing NUMBERS and breaking 15k with their debut? Love that for them

And finally, Woodz! 200k albums sold between two albums is so impressive, I hope he gets more love and support for his next comeback. Both Equal and Woops are so good"

4383,2020-12-05 22:25:31,k7gvp1,"Random Thoughts & Observations:

BTS didn't get as much of a bump in their back catalogue as I would normally expect from a new album release, but Skool Luv Affair sold 406K albums and was the second best selling album of the month, so maybe that's where all the back catalog money went.

/u/Dessidy, I thought I found an easy way to bold rows, but it ended up borking the entire table, so I'd recommend just sorting by release date to see the new albums.  If you want more functionality, copy/paste the chart into excel and that will give you way more sorting options than what reddit can do.

I don't know if Hanteo is just trolling me with versions now and they're marking it as a specific version, but are collecting all sales or what, but it's vaguely annoying to rarely have any of the other versions pop up anymore, even though you know they would have sold enough to blip into the chart.

OMG KAI DEBUT *FANGIRL*

The \#100 album was Taemin's Never Gonna Dance Again: Act 1 with 1,002 units sold.  I wonder if over 1K will be the new normal now.  It's been hovering closer to that than the old 600-800 units that it used to."
4384,2020-12-06 00:04:49,k7gvp1,"STAYC pulling a strong 15k in their debut, there is the foundations of a fanbase there... they are my dark horse for 2021, if BEP can produce them a strong comeback, they can keep establishing themselves as a group to watch."
4385,2020-12-05 23:58:26,k7gvp1,"Wow, Fatal Love has *already* outsold Fantasia X in just one month. Pretty crazy!"
4386,2020-12-06 01:53:27,k7gvp1,"I'm so proud of the Boyz. Road to Kingdom really pushed them to the top. A big fat jump of 200k+ between Reveal and Chase (7 months)
The Boyz World Domination!"
4387,2020-12-06 06:57:25,k7gvp1,"Very happy for most of the groups on this list doing fairly well. Special shoutout to Drippin and WEi for breaking the 40K sales mark! BAE173 getting to 10K is also great considering H&D's Umbrella didn't seem to do that well, I hope they can keep improving because they had such a solid debut. Also, is X1 continuing to get 5K new sales every single month? That's seriously impressive. 

Golcha's Pump It Up doing even better than Take A Leap makes me want to pump my fist in the air. They're improving and it feels so nice to see! Very curious to see how ONF perform with their next comeback after the incredible numbers Spin Off has been getting so well - hoping both groups can cross 100K soon. 

I'm happy JBJ95 are nearing 15K - their sales haven't been great lately in comparison to their previous releases but Jasmin was a wonderful album and in general I'm just rooting for them so hard."
4388,2020-12-05 22:54:59,k7gvp1,Loona really went from 30K with [#] to coming on 80K with [12:00]. I can't wait for the next Gaon update. 100K must be coming...
4389,2020-12-06 05:37:53,k7gvp1,"Not hanteo but I was surprised AB6ix managed to sell another 4.8k units on Gaon back in October, they are up to 140k sales for VIVID on that chart. They were doing a lot of online concert appearances in October so I wonder if that helped bump up VIVID sales. 

Also really nice to see the W1 solos do well. They all have such nice voices. 

AND also really nice to see Jaejoong get a good reception. I didn‚Äôt even know he released a new album, now I gotta check it out! And over 100k albums?? I don‚Äôt even hear about him anymore in the international fandom, what rock are we living under??"
4390,2020-12-06 02:20:33,k7gvp1,Loona is approaching WJSN levels of hanteo prowess.  Nice!

4392,2020-12-06 03:12:54,k7gvp1,"Woah, super surprised that Even of Day outsold Day6's last group album by over 10k! Does anyone know why? I'm guessing it's partly due to all the promotions the subunit had."
4393,2020-12-06 05:43:55,k7gvp1,"Yay for PTG breaking 100k! I hope they can keep this momentum up.

It's also nice to see Golcha and Verivery's 2nd post-RTK comebacks showed continued growth. It seems like the boost from RTK isn't just a one-off. ONEUS might well break 100k with their next release if this pattern follows, and hopefully ONF will get there or close too."
4394,2020-12-05 23:37:37,k7gvp1,"I see you list the Deep Green version for Mamamoo's travel, is there a separate figure for the Light Green version or is that figure combined for both?"

4397,2020-12-06 00:15:32,k7gvp1,Mamamoo's growth is amazing. They are the 4th Korean Girl Group ever to sell 100K on the first day and their sales keep going up especially over the years. Their last album reality in BLACK sold around 70K in the first week but that has doubled this year so the growth is immense and they're only getting even popular in their 7th year
4398,2020-12-06 02:54:21,k7gvp1,Always so proud of Seventeen! If you add in Japanese releases they have sold well over 3 million albums in 2020!

4401,2020-12-06 05:31:26,k7gvp1,"Wow, i'm super impressed with ENHYPEN's debut sales (229k) seeing as the album only got one day of tracking for november :0"

 Hope they kinda blow up in Korea because Jinny and Denise deserve a chance at fame, L√©a deserves a second chance and I want people to see Dita as more than the token foreigner. Nice seeing their sales go up a little bit for GTB"

4413,2020-12-05 23:47:36,k7gvp1,"Yeah, with BE and Skool Luv Affair Special Addition basically being double the price of regular albums, not surprised that backlog buying isn't as high this month. 

Also had a mini panic thinking you meant Taemin had only sold 1k copies of the newer album before realizing that was just additional sales for Act 1."

4415,2020-12-06 09:51:39,k7gvp1,Amazing to see them leapfrogging Fromis9 and Dreamcatcher. Definitely promising considering what felt like underperformance with # and the previous album production issues. Will be interesting to see if them promoting Voice will generate any additional sales.
4416,2020-12-06 06:50:35,k7gvp1,"Jaejoong ranked in the top 60 in Billboard Japan year-end artists and album sales, and topped album sales charts earlier this year with Brava! Still king of Japan <3"
4417,2020-12-06 10:51:23,k7gvp1,Salute has sold much less but I guess the short wait in between promotions has to be the reason why...4 months is too little time to save up
4418,2020-12-06 02:51:45,k7gvp1,they're almost at 80k and might go even higher so I'd say they're pretty much selling as much as WJSN
4419,2020-12-06 00:37:09,k7gvp1,"In the past, when they've reported in this manner, it's not been combined (there would be a listing for each version), but this year does not seem to be following that pattern well (the other versions never seem to exist for any group).

So, in short, I don't know, but I've listed it the way that Hanteo reported it."
4420,2020-12-06 06:48:05,k7gvp1,"I have not been able to stop replaying the Pit-A-Pat chorus though technically speaking I love Days from the album even more. There's something so catchy about dancing Junsu tracks. Every time I think to myself ""I'm your Peter Pan, my heart goes pit-a-pat"" I can't help smiling and bopping lol"
4421,2020-12-10 09:25:28,k7gvp1,I'm so proud of Junsu!!! I'm super crazy over Pit a Pat too!

I'm not trying to throw shade at any other groups ( i like several of the groups they are outselling ), it just seems like each comeback the stars align to prevent Dreamcatcher from getting a win."
4424,2020-12-06 00:41:29,k7gvp1,"Secret Number's Who Dis hasn't sold enough to make the monthly chart since May (see the last column on the chart).  I only track the monthly charts.  If someone is following the daily charts, they would likely have more accurate numbers for the nugu groups, especially after they stop hitting the monthly charts, but, honestly, I don't have the time nor the inclination to track every single day.  I like numbers, but they are not my entire life.  lol"

4428,2020-12-11 22:23:32,k7gvp1,"16k is still on the lower side, but with only 1 version and it being a single, they've shown good growth with Helicopter compared to their past comebacks. But at the same time, StayC debuted quite recently and have already gotten 15k sales :( So they are making progress, but as a Cheshire myself, I'm not sure what more Cube can do besides more promo such as shows and whatnot."
4429,2020-12-20 05:28:12,k7gvp1,For as long as they've been around?  Not good.
4430,2020-12-06 05:34:34,k7gvp1,"Being in Road to Kingdom definitely helped. Their first mini album released on April 1st only sold [9,257 copies by the end of the month](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/gcslj7/kpop_numbers_thread_hanteo_sales_april_2020/). RTK started on April 30th so it likely contributed a lot to the other ~17k in sales as well as  boosting the fanbase for their 2nd release.

Without RTK I think they'd be in a much worse situation. One of the members of the original lineup had to be suddenly replaced right after the show's finale due to some sort of scandal and then it took them 5 months after the finale to actually debut, so I feel like some people who watched the show would've lost interest by then."

4433,2020-12-06 14:28:24,k7gvp1,"That is exactly what I did (including using that exact website, lol).  It borked it all to shit when I tried adding the bold text.

Thanks for trying though!"
4434,2020-12-06 12:07:44,k7gvp1,"I found his YouTube channel a couple days ago and subscribed because it seemed active. I didn‚Äôt even know he was active in Korea anymore, I‚Äôll be sad if he‚Äôs still being blacklisted from broadcast stations by SM. And DUUUUUDDDEE his album?? ITS SO GOOD. 3 ballads, a rock song, and an instrumental? His voice carried those songs. And Life Support is - my brain exploded with how raw and emotional that song is. He is one of those artists who can sing without music/background music and he would still make people sit and listen. Now I kinda want a collab between him and Jaehwan. Those two singing a duet would make my earbuds short circuit."
4435,2020-12-06 13:55:38,k7gvp1,"And also: only making 2 versions instead of 3 (despite all those amazing music show costumes??? Why??); only giving fans 1 week notice of their comeback, so their overseas bars didn‚Äôt have enough time to arrange hype preorders; their comeback was in what felt like mega comeback month so, overall I would expect their sales to suffer. And last comeback they promoted 4 songs during their comeback broadcast (the answer, Surreal, Midnight Blue, red up) while this time they only did 2 (Salute, Maybe). So that may have affected album reception to the korean GP too. IMO they should‚Äôve promoted Heaven or Bloom instead of Maybe. It‚Äôs only been 1 month since the album release so maybe they‚Äôll still get more sales in if they start promoting Heaven at other performance appearances. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre doing too bad though. They‚Äôre going to open up temp cafes in Japan in January(?), without even releasing any Japanese songs lmao. So they probably have some good research metrics about growing interest in the Japanese market. 

The photobooks for Salute are soooo nice though. I said I would only get 1 version, but now i kinda want to get the other one too. Looking at Twitter, they hit 97.8k album sales on Dec1, I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll hit 100k soon if they haven‚Äôt already. 100k sales is not bad for a November release, and to be honest the album itself is not very cohesive, since each member pretty much did their own thing with their chosen song. ü§£It‚Äôs like a bridge mix of different music styles. Salute and Mirror was for general appeal but the other 4 tracks were for the fans and their own music interests, so it‚Äôs nice they could/will sell at least 100k of an album where every member had a chance to contribute a song of their own. That‚Äôs not bad for a kpop group that doesn‚Äôt even have much of a western fanbase. After Covid restrictions lift I think they‚Äôll keep their stable sales numbers and won‚Äôt have to worry about western interest disappearing when people start spending more money on recreational activities again, like sports, shopping and dining, and less money on indoor interests like kpop.

When the vaccine comes out next year in the US I expect for us to go ham on going back outside and resuming our spending activities like normal. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll be allowed to have too big gatherings like concerts or sports games though, those might still get limited capacity for at least a year while everyone waits for vaccinations. But I can imagine more people being comfortable with going out to spend their fun money on shopping and dining instead of kpop albums. Which means the kpop market in the west will shink again when that happens.

I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôm going with this post anymore lol.

But yeah... Ab6ix‚Äôs first week sales for Salute was only 13k less than VIVID‚Äôs first week sales and that‚Äôs with one less album version and 1 week notice for Salute (versus VIVID‚Äôs 1 month notice because of YM leaving). So their korean/SEA fanbase is still there and still pretty stable. Anything else after that 80k album sale mark is extra (or at least their R&D department should mark it as extra). As long as they stay within their spending budget, they‚Äôll be fine. Their members are also less in numbers and they get songwriting royalties so on an individual level, even with less album sales, their members will do fine financially compared to idols who have to split profits 6 to 11 ways with no songwriting royalties.

Boy oh boy this has turned into another really long post of just me sorting my thoughts so I‚Äôll stop here."

The fact that Finale sales kinda flatlined by Feb and online stores not being able to restock implies that like you, someone at SM decided that the forecast was reached and that was that. 

It looks like a supply issue, not demand."

Jaejoong's voice is absolutely incredible, he's made for rock ballads. You've put this idea of a Jaejoong x Jaehwan duet in my head now and I really, really, really need it haha"
4440,2020-12-06 16:43:47,k7gvp1,"Oh I wasn't aware the comeback was only announced a week before. That's definitely not enough time for overseas bars to collect and order. I agree on the comeback date being too packed with other groups since I am buying albums for other groups too. Combine the other factors and their sales would fall. 

I don't mind the album not being cohesive since I prefer different music styles in an album but to each to their own. 

I was just worried YM leaving the group would affect sales but it doesn't seem so. Many of his fans still support the group (which I doubt would be the same for Daewhi or Woojin). 6IXENSE last year sold 141,280 on Gaon and VIVID sold about the same amount too. Granted VIVID does have one more version but they're still impressive figures without fansigns. 

Also, the only time I prefer smaller groups is when they split profits. Each member gets more than larger groups. Otherwise I prefer performances by larger groups since they don't need backup dancers. I don't doubt AB6IX can't do the same though. Of course this is when Woojin is fully healed. Only Donghyun falls behind in dance but his expressions are killer and he completely surprised me in Salute! 

(I don't mind you posting that much since abnews on reddit are so hard to find.)"
4441,2020-12-08 07:36:19,k7gvp1,"half the comments on the youtube videos were something like ""i was pissed that Yedam from treasure lost, but now i understand"" lol"
4442,2020-12-06 03:53:13,k7gvp1,"That has been mentioned before in regards to Red Velvet, but every time, I have been able to find it new in online shops.  Right now is no exception.

If it were a supply issue, you shouldn't be able to find it anywhere except ebay second hand."
4443,2020-12-07 06:15:30,k7gvp1,"Omg Donghyun. I don‚Äôt know if you watched it but his major lack of coordination/disorientation in the AB4U episode with the upside down goggles was hilarious but also an apt reflection of his struggle with coordinating his body when learning/copying choreography. And he worked really hard on choosing how to do his ‚Äúpiece of cake‚Äù move...only for it to get cut from the MV ü§£. Poor guy. He tries hard though.

I really like the songs Youngmin wrote for 6IXENSE so him missing from AB6ix is not just his presence, but his style of music too. On the flip side, now the pressure is on for Woojin and Woong to step in and contribute more with composing as well. I hope they release another full length album next year instead of shorter EPs because I‚Äôm greedy and want more music. Anyway yeah, losing a member does affect their stage presence, but I think they can still rock it. If 2ne1, Shinee, Winner, 2Am, Mamamoo, etc can fill a stage with just 4, they‚Äôll be fine. I like the dance team for the simple reason that it puts stress off the idols from performing more strenuous moves. It‚Äôs a great way to add movement to a dance while minimizing idols‚Äô risks of long term health problems like back injuries. Basically it‚Äôs a ‚Äúshare the burden of performance‚Äù tool so the idols don‚Äôt get too worn out over the weeks of performance after performance during a comeback and tour. Flashy dances performed by the idols are nice and all but they come with a price on the idols‚Äô bodies in the long term. A lot of older kpop idols have back and joint pain issues and I bet in 20 years all the idols active during this current performance-based kpop craze are going to start making regular appointments at the chiropractor‚Äôs office or something."
4444,2020-12-08 11:54:51,k7gvp1,"And I feel like the Korean comments are mirroring this sentiment - imagine if dita went and got to round 3, that would be grand!"
4445,2020-12-07 13:18:44,k7gvp1,"Poor Donghyun...He really does work hard but unfortunately some people are just not blessed. Really hope he doesn't feel too bad since it's not his fault his team members are just that talented at dance. He makes up for it in presence and expressions though. What a man!

Didn't Youngmin only compose Shadow for 6IXENSE? That's just one song so losing his style of music is not a big deal. I don't know if he composed for MXM though. I also can't say for the lyrics he wrote since I don't know Korean. 

Their performances will be fine since like you mentioned a lot of other groups still manage. If they want to do choreo heavy dances, Seventeen's Performance Unit performs as 4 too. AB6IX definitely have the dance skills and charisma to perform as 4 (although with easier choreo for Donghyun). They won't be able to do the standard V but line formation is fine too. They can still have interesting formations like performance unit (lili yabbay!)

Not that I don't like backup dancers. You bring up some good points. They help share the burden especially with Woojin's injury. I just don't like when groups only use them to fill a smaller stage (weekly music shows) or to seem more charismatic. I've noticed many idols fall in stage presence or dancing when they have dancers and I don't like that. Especially when a group has more members like above 6, that much should be charismatic enough. 

I like how AB6IX use their backup dancers as props/support though. Daewhi's swing in Answer and Woong's step in Salute. Dreamcatcher also used their backup dancers well for Boca and Scream."
4446,2020-12-07 20:52:59,k7gvp1,"Omg you‚Äôre right about YM. For some reason I thought he had 3 songs (shadow, the DREAM unit song, and his solo breakup), but he only composed Shadow. Did some digging and in MXM he has 2 songs while Donghyun has 4 songs, among their albums [more than ever](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/9774od/mxm_more_than_ever_1st_full_album/), [One more](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/9uy1uh/mxm_one_more_special_single_album/), and [unmix](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/6yfaj2/mxm_brandnew_boys_unmix_1st_mini_album/). [good day](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/6pv13g/mxm_good_day_prerelease/) and [matchup](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/7pegkf/mxm_brandnewboys_match_up_2nd_mini_album/) were MXM‚Äôs other releases but one has repeat tracks and the other was all made by company producers.

Ab6ix also has Woong who can do acrobatics but I think they worry about injury a lot. Daehwi is also kind of on the thin side (less muscle mass = less ATP/instant energy stores for active movement) so while he is quick at learning choreo and has a really nice dance style, he tires out fast with the more aggressive boy group dances, especially during Wanna One‚Äôs Burn It Up stage - I‚Äôve seen him struggle to get up after finishing that dance; even in today‚Äôs [Behind the Scene](https://youtube.com/watch?v=wnTbrQtEu_0&t=6m51s) upload of their Salute promotions Daehwi‚Äôs the only one who immediately sits down to rest after they finish filming MCountdown‚Äôs Salute stage while the other 3 members walk off stage. Woojin and Woong are really the only members who seem passionate about dance IMO, Daehwi and Donghyun seem like they just want to write music and sing lol. 

I was watching a YouTube segment where 2 guys who make choreography for different groups [were talking about](https://youtube.com/watch?v=VVMjf25w-kM&Zyrtec&t=3m30s) how they tailor choreo to not put so much pressure on Woojin‚Äôs injured leg. So it‚Äôs nice to know a dance group can be used to do the harder parts in a dance although you‚Äôre right that it does take away from stage presence if the dancers stand out too much.

Anyway if reddit had a friend option I would totally send you a friend request. I like chatting about AB6ix and it‚Äôs been nice to find someone on Reddit to gush with about this stuff."
4447,2020-12-12 20:56:30,k7gvp1,"I've only just checked out MXM's songs so I'm now looking forward to the songs he produced! I actually thought Daewhi produced Shadow since it reminds me of Dandelion (which he did produce). Thanks for the links too since I've been struggling to find the credits!

Daewhi does struggle with more aggressive dances so it's fortunate that they do less of those. I never knew it was because he was thin but that does make sense. He mentioned on Idol Quiz (so far only snippets are available) that he dances less when the camera is not on him to conserve energy (but he said that's because he's older). Nice to see that he's taking care of himself. Off topic but Daewhi is my favorite dancer in the group. His dance lines are really clean and he hits each move with just the right amount of energy. Even though Woojin is the best dancer, Daewhi is the better idol dancer imo. (I saw this video that was comparing dancers in Loona. Olivia is a better dancer but Heejin is the better idol dancer.)

Woong can definitely fill in for dancing but he did mention in his recent live that between dancing and singing, he'd choose singing. Also, have you seen their recent performance of Blind for Love on the Fact Music Awards? Woong covered for Woojin's center part when he does the twirl. I hope there's a fancam because I really need to see that in detail. 

They also used just the right number of backup dancers in their recent Blind for Love during the chorus when Woojin stood off stage. 2 just reminds me of ot5 so 4 is just enough to create the standard V. The three also didn't fall behind with their stage presence so that was nice to see.

I wonder if r/AB6IX has made a Discord chat room though. Maybe that way we'll meet more ABNEWS!"

And more interstingly.. if race mixing was genocide.. what race is being 'genocided' exactly? Isn't it both? White Americans used to think that one drop of black blood would be enough to make a white person impure, but black people never believed nonsense like one drop of white blood would destroy the black race or smth, because it's supremacist nonsense.  
You could say that Asian americans marrying into white populations is genocide against whites too, it's the same deeply flawed logic is it not.   
Not to mention this only focusses on skin color and such, and ignores the scientic reality of ""race"" or more accurately ethnicity being far more complex than ""asian, black, white, etc."".

as a budding comic, how do you work your content during a pandemic when the most important part of stand up is the audience? 

how to work with the relentless politically correct culture these days, where everything is offensive to someone regardless of intention? is it worth it to suppress your opinion for the sake of likability with the audience?"
4748,2020-12-04 23:22:01,k0mybh,"I'd like more answers on ""mid tier"" comedy, for people who are trying to cross over into regularly featuring and doing more consistent road work. There's a lot of advice for guys just starting out, but navigating the politics of a scene and the challenges of crossing over from ""funny but unpaid"" to ""funny and occasionally paid"" is something that rarely gets spoken about. 

Obviously Barry is comedy royalty but when he was starting, how did he decide to be a manager? It seems like in the 70's there were tons of comedy-adjacent people or struggling comics who said ""fuck it, I love the biz so I'll stay in it on the management side"" - I literally have seen not one single person make this decision since I started comedy. So ""find a young, hungry manager to who will build a career with you"" feels like asking to find a skilled blacksmith, I'm sure some exist but you probably need a time machine.

Also I wouldn't mind some personal anecdotes about how to talk to a booker if you're new to a scene but not new to comedy. Like... I have an act, but the club bookers in my scene are unapproachable. They're like hot girls at the bar - even casual conversation has a vibe of ""Yeah, you want the same thing everyone else here does so don't even bring it up"" - but then the scene comics work to keep everyone who isn't in their cliques from performing at the club... and any mic nights, the bookers never actually watch.

So there's a group of people who have to see you to pass into clubs, but they seem to refuse to actually see anyone new unless that person is supplied by a specific, small social group of passed local comics. Beyond ""break into the clique and become friends with people who can recommend you"" or ""start your own shows"" how do you even begin to break that paradigm?

Also... what's the best way one can string together a road tour? Even if it's like a Tribble Run, if Barry has advice for the best way for a comic to frame a pitch to a bar or club about having them on, that'd be good info."

4784,2020-12-15 04:13:57,k0mybh,What is a common bit of advice given to comics by industry/representation folks that is misguided/more hurtful than helpful?
4785,2020-12-16 00:42:45,k0mybh,"Thanks, I'd like to try stand-up when it's allowed again, and I have ideas, however I don't know how to break it down and write out its evolution.

The life and the lifestyle of a comedian is well documented, however the secrets to timing, reading a room, bring a joke/bit from concept to microphone, are mostly answered with ""ya just gotta figure it out, feel it out"". I'm not looking for shortcuts, mainly just how to start the process and, I guess a bit more detail besides the ""gotta figure it out"" answers."
4786,2020-12-16 00:52:57,k0mybh,"Oh thought of another one...

I've noticed through watching older specials, such as the Bill Hicks specials for example, that comedians could get away with using a great set of jokes over a period of 3 to 5 years or more and it would still kill.

How much more work has the internet caused for the average stand up comedian? How often do they have to put jokes/bits on the shelf and create new content due to overexposure? 

Thanks

Is Standup Comedy Doomed ? Will Netflix own every piece of Comedy ? How do i get my fix for a genuwine laugh and good act

4789,2021-04-20 13:18:49,k0mybh,Where's the video?
4790,2021-03-27 07:46:12,k0mybh,I‚Äôm looking forward to the video. Has it been a week yet?
4791,2020-12-05 02:01:20,k0mybh,"Most people who want to be funny as a hobby don't need to spend 3-4+ hours a night, 3-4+ nights a week practicing on stage around disinterested people who are just staring at their phones, waiting for their chance to speak. Therefore the labor it takes to do mics (at the volume you need to make inroads into a scene) is a natural filter for most hobbyists. Also, IMO the steps you need to be booked regularly locally and the steps you need to take to get paid to do comedy are the same early on, so it's a moot point about why you're in the game, the steps will be the same even if you just want regular stage time and not a career."

4793,2021-03-03 00:36:19,k0mybh,Funny is funny man. If you're not getting booked you're not hanging out enough or need to tighten up your act.

4797,2021-03-04 02:29:45,k0mybh,I understand but consider that you're really trying to make professional contacts. Relationships built on mutual respect to get work. You can do that at any age. If the kids aren't on that tip then find the cats who are. That's why I also stress developing your act to the best of your ability. Idk what ur scene is but I found a lot of success getting out of the comedy scene and into the music/poetry scene. I start opening for bands and suddenly people want me on shows they never wanted me on before. It's also important to be seen as someone to take seriously. A lot of doing comedy in your early twenties is the hang and you're not really considering career as much. Find the professionals.
4798,2020-11-23 20:31:27,jzpocg,"If I had a nickel for every time Hulu bought a timeloop movie, I'd have two nickels. Which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it happened twice."
4799,2020-11-23 22:07:26,jzpocg,Was wondering when this was finally going to come out.
4800,2020-11-24 03:02:08,jzpocg,I‚Äôm more excited for Fatman.
4801,2020-11-24 02:47:24,jzpocg,Also starring Rob Gronkowski.
4802,2020-11-24 12:22:51,jzpocg,"But there will be a screen saying ""YOU DIED"" after every death?"
4803,2020-11-25 17:43:25,jzpocg,Not a bad action movie for Guan Yin. Famous for 'doing that'
4804,2020-11-23 15:12:28,jzjbvp,Trying to raise money to help with a community clean water well and it was nice of him to retweet!
4805,2020-11-23 06:38:44,jzcjvn,Jack Black Uncle Iroh just sings the whole plot of the story to the tune of ‚ÄúWonderboy.‚Äù
4806,2020-11-23 07:16:35,jzcjvn,"Love this! But, I'd pick Karen Fukuhara as Ty-Lee, if you watch her youtube channel she is a really happy bubbly person IRL and she has already played dark broody characters like Kimiko and Katana, which, I get the appeal to see her as Mai because of that. I think it would be cool for her to play someone different in a live action."
4807,2020-11-23 07:38:10,jzcjvn,He's aged up quite considerably some characters though.
4808,2020-11-23 11:53:42,jzcjvn,"This is a genuine question not snark. Can someone tell me why Midori Francis is so frequently fancast as Azula? I know nothing about the actress at all, never seen her in anything, so I‚Äôm just curious as to why so many people choose her. Also, is there something in particular I should watch that would give me a good idea of her abilities/range?"
4809,2020-11-23 18:30:33,jzcjvn,"This is bad ass casting right here, I approve of every single person. Hell yeah. Let‚Äôs get contracts signed and get this shit in production"
4810,2020-11-26 13:40:10,jzcjvn,"Ok, I agree with most of this. Except I think regular zuko should be Dante. And Iroh should be Appa from Kim‚Äôs conviniance. And (even though he‚Äôs white) Christofer Lloyd as bumi. I know he‚Äôs white but like it‚Äôs just so perfect. And the rock as the boulder. I mean their names are similar too. I love Ken jeong as cabbage man tho that‚Äôs brilliant."
4811,2021-04-19 06:58:54,jzcjvn,I absolutely loved seeing your picks whether I agree or not. Job well done time well spent ‚ù§
4812,2020-11-23 11:34:38,jzcjvn,"Yeah, he was trying to find actors who could really match the characters But I think some of them are just a bit o old. Particularly may and  ty lee."
4813,2020-11-23 23:56:31,jzcjvn,"It's because they think she would be able to pull off Azula's sadistic intimidating side. Pluss she is Asian, and (kind of) within the age range. He putts a few clips of her acting in the video. After seeing that I think she could play azula very well.  I just wish she were a bit younger."
4814,2020-11-28 04:07:24,jzcjvn,"I wish for Dante too but, he's just way too old."
4815,2020-11-22 20:51:59,jz1i8u,"as a huge dbz nerd, i am a fan"

4818,2020-11-25 04:08:58,jz1i8u,That scouter sure can see everybody's voices. üëÅ
4819,2020-11-22 16:28:51,jyy30n,"What about the accolades? Do they match?

Edit: they dont.üôÅ

he has a networth of 150 millions, 38 grammy nominations and 13 wins and two oscar nominations. We already unmasked the Oscar nominee of this season so as much as id love him on the show i dont think its him :((( good guess tho"
4820,2020-11-22 16:21:51,jyy30n,"I would love it to be Pharrell!! Thanks for this write-up!

Edit: want to add that I think Aloe Blacc is another good guess. Someone pointed out he also fits some of the clues: worked in corporate, scholar, hamilton mixtapes, etc. He also wears hats and is multi-talented in different areas and has helped others grow in music and his philanthropic efforts.

Another edit: Aloe recently released a new album and he has also worked with [https://mushroommusic.com/creative/](https://mushroommusic.com/creative/)"
4821,2020-11-22 17:29:02,jyy30n,"He's the celebrity they want us to think it is, but isn't. So many of the clues fit though. So many."
4822,2020-11-22 16:17:48,jyy30n,I‚Äôm hoping that this next episode can finally give us an answer on who mushroom could be
4823,2020-11-22 16:10:46,jyy30n,"attention people! I will still keep my guess that mushroom is Jordan Fisher, but this publication is another alternative if it is not Jordan, so this publication where I am going to talk about this celebrity who may be hiding under the mushroom mask is my second guess being that Jordan is the first guess!"
4824,2020-11-22 21:34:31,jyy30n,"Too many nominations, theory is interesting, though."
4825,2020-11-22 23:13:51,jyy30n,"I've been co-riding the Jordan Fisher/Todrick Hall train for Mushroom, but Pharell isn't a bad guess, either. A lot of connections made I didn't think of. Plus, the very first clue we received for Mushroom about guessing who is under Mushroom's hats could also point to Pharell's habit of wearing so many hats."
4826,2020-11-22 19:26:12,jyy30n,"YES! Pharrell was my original first guess too!!! N.E.R.D are still one of my absolute favorite musical acts so I jumped on that ""embracing being a nerd"" clue."
4827,2020-11-22 18:25:52,jyy30n,Really good guess at this point it could be anyone but this is a real good guess
4828,2020-11-22 18:31:48,jyy30n,might be him
4829,2020-11-24 02:24:26,jyy30n,[https://www.motor1.com/news/388228/lewis-hamilton-vegan-leather-mercedes/](https://www.motor1.com/news/388228/lewis-hamilton-vegan-leather-mercedes/)
4830,2020-11-24 16:16:41,jyy30n,"Mushroom is Todrick Hall.. he is connected to Pharrell by doing a mash up video with Happy called  Shake it. He also choreographed the video for Beyonce‚Äôs Blow which featured Pharrell. The Hotdog Stand is a nod to Chicago the Musical. You will see one of the Mushroom caps in the mushroom city looks like a Deep dish Pizza. The grasshopper and the Violin is a Nod to The Sound of Music and Fiddler on the roof which he saw when he was in elementary school with his teacher and started his love of music and fine arts. Turning the world upside down, and falling is his Oz The Musical which lost money. The mean girls is a nod to his parody Mean Boyz. The orange juice with the Oversized Orange slice on it is a nod to JoJo Siwa and being in JoJos Juice. The pancakes, eggs, orange juice being bossy is a nod to his video Ordering at IHOP. Being ridiculed and hiding in the bathroom a nod to Kinky Boots. The bathroom being all alone in the stall with extra toilet paper a nod to Quarentine Queen. The squirrel a nod to the Nutcracker and Ru Paul(squirrel friend). North Spore High is a nod to Pop Star high his story of if all the celebrities went to the same high school. Deer horns and kangaroo burn book a nod to Forbidden and his Unicorn hoodies. The stage with the Gold star.. Theres 9 green mushrooms on the bottom corners of the screen... Season 9 American Idol. Another mushroom cap in the clue package looks like sesame bun top a nod to his Burger King video. Needless to say, pretty sure mushroom is Todrick Hall-,check out the video 4 Beyonc√© to get a good vocal range and comparison. Oh and he also appeared on Wild N Out."
4831,2020-11-22 18:37:52,jyy30n,My sister is so certain it‚Äôs Pharrell!
4832,2020-11-22 19:42:34,jyy30n,"is the excellent guess, is a good analysis, I have to agree, it makes sense"
4833,2020-11-22 23:41:21,jyy30n,The mushroom is Lewis Hamilton
4834,2020-11-22 18:15:04,jyy30n,This makes sense
4835,2020-11-22 19:53:50,jyy30n,It‚Äôs somebody from Hamilton
4836,2020-11-22 20:22:34,jyy30n,I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs Anthony Ramos
4837,2020-11-22 19:28:31,jyy30n,"Dang, I was about to get behind this guess, too!"
4838,2020-11-25 00:46:22,jyy30n,And this was why I ruled Pharrell out
4839,2020-11-22 16:41:38,jyy30n,"you're right, it might not even be him, because my real guess is Jordan Fisher, Pharrel was an alternative guess if it weren't for Jordan, I know it's impossible for Pharrel to appear in the masked singer because of the Praise, but thanks for adding more about pharrell which has a net worth of 150 million, 38 Grammy nominations and 13 victories and two Oscar nominations. (I didn't know about this) what caught my attention sero Pharrel was the tracks, but I think I'm more sure it is Jordan."
4840,2020-11-22 17:35:57,jyy30n,This could actually be a great guess. He's about the same height as Mushroom too. And the podcast clue could refer to him starting music by playing a broken trumpet.
4841,2020-11-22 16:34:40,jyy30n,"me too, i'm very curious for next week, i hope mushroom surprises more, i love the mushroom too much, he sings with a beautiful incredible voice i love listening to him, and i want mushroom and crocodile together in the final"
4842,2020-11-22 20:25:19,jyy30n,"it's a great guess, I liked it"
4843,2020-11-22 19:33:11,jyy30n,Great minds think alike!!
4844,2020-11-22 16:42:33,jyy30n,I‚Äôd love for him to be on the show and yours is a great guess!!
4845,2020-11-22 19:36:58,jyy30n,"I don't understand why you are receiving negative votes, you did not offend or attack, does anyone explain why he is receiving negative votes?"
4846,2020-11-22 16:41:32,jyy30n,Me three. Totes obsessed with this shroom. Can't wait for the next performance!

4848,2020-11-20 21:03:25,jxxdhv,"This whole period of Raw just bolsters my theory that when it comes to guest hosts, there‚Äôs the Muppet Show, then SNL, then everyone else.

Edit: to clarify, I mean that shows that utilize guests hosts are ranked this way. For example, I‚Äôd place Muppets Tonight in the ‚Äúeveryone else‚Äù category because they never utilized them very well."
4849,2020-11-20 21:09:03,jxxdhv,"This was the ‚ÄúSummerfest‚Äù episode, wasn‚Äôt it?"
4850,2020-11-20 21:38:38,jxxdhv,Ken took such a nasty bump on this episode
4851,2020-11-20 21:10:01,jxxdhv,In an alternate universe he turned face and understood he was just joking around.
4852,2020-11-20 21:03:30,jxxdhv,Well I don‚Äôt see anything racist about this
4853,2020-11-20 21:20:45,jxxdhv,"Bob Barker, William Shatner, and Hugh Jackman were great hosts."
4854,2020-11-20 21:20:47,jxxdhv,"Bob Barker was a good and memorable guest host, and I'd put him up with the Muppet's. David Arquette you could also tell was having fun boasting about being former World Champion. But yeah everyone else was kind of a waste of time and uninteresting. Especially the guy that was in the ring and they did a Tiger Woods skit with a woman chasing a guy dressed up in a tiger costume outside the ring. Yeesh."
4855,2020-11-20 21:58:52,jxxdhv,The muppets on Raw was pretty great

1.	Muppets
2.	Dudes from SNL
3.	Everyone else

I agree though, I can‚Äôt think of a single show other than those two that have done guest hosts well."

4858,2020-11-20 22:19:36,jxxdhv,He got a concussion!
4859,2020-11-20 21:04:53,jxxdhv,to be fair stereotypical asain was Jeongs whole thing when he was popular for a minute around community and hangover.
4860,2020-11-20 21:16:34,jxxdhv,Part of me wondered if it was because the tv in the background had the movie they were promoting on a loop.
4861,2020-11-20 21:11:28,jxxdhv,Oh good grief
4862,2020-11-20 23:37:00,jxxdhv,Do people not see that this is sarcasm
4863,2020-11-21 02:48:42,jxxdhv,That‚Äôs most likely it. Most movie/tv show promotional stuff is usually edited out wherever possible.
4864,2020-11-19 05:14:40,jwwnwy,I'm starting to wonder how many he really gets right and how many the producers tell him to fudge or say something silly.
4865,2020-11-19 14:48:54,jwwnwy,I‚Äôve seen he tends to get basketball players right then even people he‚Äôs worked with before
4866,2020-11-19 07:22:29,jwwnwy,I've wondered if the times he says something really outlandishly silly is because he really doesn't know and doesn't want to pretend that he's making a serious guess because this show isn't meant to be taken seriously.
4867,2020-11-19 07:23:36,jwwnwy,"There is no way in hell the producers don't check and have approval over every one of the judges guesses and I'm sure they feed guesses to the judges as well. You don't run one of the biggest TV shows in the world leaving anything to chance. 

I hate when I see people complaining about the judges being bad guessers, it's so dumb. Especially Ken, considering that is his role on the show!"
4868,2020-11-21 17:39:28,jwwnwy,They just plan it that way because not everyone follows the NBA and they can make a reveal for someone most people wouldn't know slightly more entertaining. The guesses are fake.
4869,2020-11-21 18:14:09,jwwnwy,yeah yeah conspiracy theories everything is fake moon landing is a myth.
4870,2020-11-17 20:10:52,jvynm5,This looks like it could have been made any time after 1995.
4871,2020-11-17 22:16:17,jvynm5,Michael Pena really likes starring in movies based on cartoons.
4872,2020-11-17 20:01:46,jvynm5,"Pretty low risk poster. If I had it put up, no one would know if it's for the likely train wreck 2020 movie or just a regular Tom and Jerry poster."
4873,2020-11-17 23:54:22,jvynm5,Can't wait to see Michael Che's Weekend Update slams on Jost for this movie.
4874,2020-11-17 23:10:34,jvynm5,"Honestly, who actually rooted for Jerry? Jerry sucks."
4875,2020-11-17 20:18:23,jvynm5,"For a moment I thought it was going to be live action, by reading the title alone. It was a terrifying moment"
4876,2020-11-17 22:33:00,jvynm5,Plot twist: you can only see the legs of all those actors.
4877,2020-11-18 08:36:17,jvynm5,While I've never been a fan of Tom & Jerry. I thought this was going to be a full animated movie. Not another one of these terrible live action with cartoons things.
4878,2020-11-17 22:14:19,jvynm5,that's a lot more voices than you'd usually need for anything T&J-related.
4879,2020-11-18 02:34:07,jvynm5,Cool.  Tim story. He directed fantastic four two. He‚Äôs a decent director
4880,2020-11-18 12:54:40,jvynm5,Wow is this movie going to be a pile of shit.  Tom and Jerry is passable in 7 minute cartoons but it's going to just have people most of the time?
4881,2020-11-18 18:28:28,jvynm5,"Simple and nice.
I like it."
4882,2020-11-19 01:10:03,jvynm5,"Saw the trailer, and it looks less an actual film. And more like something that could be a short.

Also they committed a cardinal sin. Tom's scream sounds really really bad. Also, the live action mixed with CG/animation.. Looks really out of place.."
4883,2020-11-17 21:07:11,jvynm5,Watched the trailer earlier and it looked neat. It doesn't look like a masterpiece or anything but it looks like it'll be fun for it's intended audience. I know when I was a kid I loved things like this.
4884,2020-11-17 21:31:15,jvynm5,Having Ken Jeong in your movies costs you at least one ticket. Can't stand this guy.
4885,2020-11-18 15:15:52,jvynm5,Why the hell does a Tom & Jerry movie have voice actors? Sounds like an automatic nope for me.
4886,2020-11-17 22:42:20,jvynm5,Who is this movie's audience exactly? Young kids aren't going to know who this cast is.
4887,2020-11-17 20:38:05,jvynm5,Colin Yost? He is in movies now? Dang marrying scarjo really is moving him up in the world.
4888,2020-11-18 05:30:20,jvynm5,What a fucking title. Wow.
4889,2020-11-18 09:02:12,jvynm5,"This looks atrocious, the trailer felt like it was presenting a film with a few Tom and jerry skits while an insufferable lady smirks out the side of her mouth and basically narrates what's happening. Looks dumb and lazy."
4890,2020-11-17 20:32:59,jvynm5,"""Tom & Jerry"" are the buzzwords on every child's lips right now. 

Not. 

Unless this is some genius-level reinvention, why would anyone greenlight this film?"
4891,2020-11-17 23:32:17,jvynm5,It was.
4892,2020-11-18 02:41:07,jvynm5,This and Dora right? Is that really that much if a pattern?
4893,2020-11-18 20:57:27,jvynm5,"Get some White Out and remove the bottom, good as new."
4894,2020-11-17 23:42:07,jvynm5,I like it because of that. I can at least pretend for a second it's classic Tom and Jerry.
4895,2020-11-18 04:04:08,jvynm5,Certainly not those of us who like cats.....
4896,2020-11-17 20:25:22,jvynm5,It is but it‚Äôs like Roger Rabbit
4897,2020-11-18 05:07:10,jvynm5,"By reading the title, I assumed the title was written by a bot.

>It will star the famous cat and mouse duo of the film, Tom and Jerry.

...huh?"
4898,2020-11-18 21:16:18,jvynm5,Personally for adaptations like this Is rather it be a mix. If you wanted to watch cartoons you have several options. I'd prefer movie adaptations bring something new to the table.
4899,2020-11-18 21:13:29,jvynm5,It doesn't it's a live action/cartoon mix. The actors you see listed are real people while Tom and Jerry are cartoons.
4900,2020-11-17 23:35:37,jvynm5,kids don't watch movies because of the cast...
4901,2020-11-17 23:31:22,jvynm5,"Kids like cartoon characters interacting with real people. It's a fun concept. Also this is something parents (who know Tom and Jerry) cam watch with their children, while at the same time introducing a new generation to the characters. It actually makes a lot of sense IMO."
4902,2020-11-17 21:19:50,jvynm5,Guess The Addams Family was profitable.
4903,2020-11-17 21:11:04,jvynm5,You think they'd be trying to appeal to children with this and not every adult?
4904,2020-11-18 03:11:17,jvynm5,"He was also in My Little Pony, and if you want to consider cartoons and comics in a similar category the Ant-Man movies"
4905,2020-11-21 03:25:03,jvynm5,He has a type of movie he likes. He'll probably end up in one of the new sonic movies if they make more. Or a looney tunes thing.
4906,2020-11-17 20:27:28,jvynm5,"Oh. I'm honestly not sure if they can pull it off, movies like roger rabbit and space jam need an internal reason to look how they look to work. I guess we'll see"
4907,2020-11-18 20:58:25,jvynm5,Hmm.
4908,2020-11-18 22:40:42,jvynm5,That‚Äôs even worse than if the cat and mouse talked. üòÇ
4909,2020-11-18 02:49:02,jvynm5,i see tom and jerry in a lot of memes.  i think younger kids online will be somewhat familiar.
4910,2020-11-18 03:13:14,jvynm5,">He was also in My Little Pony, 

Ahh good shout. As for Ant-man, I probably wouldn't categorise it with the three listed here"
4911,2020-11-17 21:08:15,jvynm5,Well I don‚Äôt think enough plot details have been released enough to see if there‚Äôs a reason they are in live-action.
4912,2020-11-18 09:00:35,jvynm5,"That's... All they need? Nothing else? Just an explanation for a ""look""? Do people even know what's in a movie?"
4913,2020-11-18 09:41:53,jvynm5,"Never said it's a sufficient condition, but it's a necessary one"

4915,2020-11-17 18:59:35,jvy9bs,I miss the Era where Tom would straight up try to shoot Jerry
4916,2020-11-17 21:01:52,jvy9bs,"I like the old ones better, not realistic lol."
4917,2020-11-17 20:42:19,jvy9bs,Doesn't look good - I get the feeling that Tom and Jerry will be side characters.
4918,2020-11-17 21:56:49,jvy9bs,Hard pass.

4920,2020-11-17 22:53:43,jvy9bs,"To clarify, not saying this movie is going to automatically be good. It's just nice to see that even the C-plot wedding is getting more diverse. Also good to see Pallavi Sharda around more often - she's an underrated performer with experience in at least 5 international film industries"
4921,2020-11-17 20:49:42,jvy9bs,Cringe. I don't know why the entertainment industry has such a mindless grudge against traditional 2-dimensional animation.
4922,2020-11-17 22:48:56,jvy9bs,"Is it just me or do the 3D models look a little... off? I mean if you're going to try and emulate 2D animation THAT much just use 2D animation. The way it looks now gives me a weird sort of ""uncanny valley"" feeling."
4923,2020-11-17 22:27:07,jvy9bs,Lol people are going to be so mad that it's a White man with an Indian woman.

4926,2020-11-17 21:16:11,jvy9bs,Good for desi women. Bad for desi men.
4927,2020-11-18 07:31:07,jvy9bs,"Just let them rest in peace. How much they're gonna milk this cow?
Honestly what happened to new content?"
4928,2020-11-18 04:09:18,jvy9bs,"Man this just looks bad, they seem more like side characters."

4930,2021-02-17 15:59:01,jvy9bs,Desi wedding is just to appeal to Indian people hollywood wouldn't give a shit otherwise
4931,2020-11-18 01:23:19,jvy9bs,And so what?
4932,2020-11-17 19:31:08,jvy9bs,Tom was committing war crimes to get to Jerry

4935,2020-11-17 21:38:54,jvy9bs,T&J did not need to be a wannabe Who Framed Roger Rabbit. This is just Hollywood trying to appeal to the common denominator. Hard pass.
4936,2020-11-17 19:19:49,jvy9bs,"And she‚Äôs an Indian-Australian from her IMDB page, so that‚Äôs pretty cool to see a second gen desi in such a prominent role!"
4937,2020-11-17 21:20:41,jvy9bs,It is 2 dimension animation! They're not using normal 3D CGI
4938,2020-11-18 00:59:03,jvy9bs,But it's... literally 2D animation lmfao. Did you even watch it or did you just shit on it automatically lol
4939,2020-11-17 23:10:18,jvy9bs,Hollywood is a white man's fantasy
4940,2020-11-18 07:49:59,jvy9bs,"There has been plenty, but they've all been animated, not really had ""real human""  characters. But yeah, in the one I think you're mentioning, Tom and Jerry: The Movie, they do start for some reason speaking English with the girl."

4946,2020-11-18 07:44:29,jvy9bs,"Very true! Although there were a lot of outdated concepts societal-wise, it's amazing how it animation-wise at least still holds up for today. Still are many scenes that are good and funny, although there are many other scenes that didn't age well as well."
4947,2020-11-18 23:12:11,jvy9bs,"Man set his bar for animation so high, I can barely get through kids shows today"
4948,2020-11-17 19:25:15,jvy9bs,"that‚Äôs interesting, I didn‚Äôt know that! it‚Äôs also pretty cool to see that she‚Äôs done some bollywood movies too."

4958,2020-11-17 23:22:00,jvy9bs,Not all POC. South and East Asian men on the whole are too passive.
4959,2020-11-18 00:15:53,jvy9bs,A fair indian woman's fantasy. All that disgusting love crap sets unrealistic expectations for women. Most actors don't even look like an average Indian. Recently they have started playing up white culture too.
4960,2020-11-18 17:41:11,jvy9bs,"Yeah, yours better way to put it. Bad as in the absence of good is how I intended to mean it.

Just doesn‚Äôt sound as good when firing off as a sound byte lol."

Bollywood is catered towards North Indians who are lighter, of course not as much as Bollywood actors but then colourism in India is a complicated issue just like in East Asia (I mean Xi Jinping isn't ""brown"" Chinese, he's just Chinese) and isn't entirely wrong."

4974,2020-12-29 11:13:08,km8gq2,"Watched all 10 episodes - it was a little disjointed with the pilot being episode 7 and the mystery 'booth' rounds being different from week to week.

In our house we got pretty good at guessing the good singers.

Playing the meta game in ICSYV is quite fun - how many good singers do they have this week? Would an American broadcaster allow an Army veteran to be the butt of a joke? Would they really be so obvious as to pretend about an Asian man being a country singer?

I don't think the format has legs though without some changes - the earlier rounds don't matter at all, there's no way to win the 50,000 even if you wanted to. The strategy is to find one real singer you are dead sure of and keep them until the end, the show might as well end after the lip sync rounds for most episodes.

Don't get me wrong, lots of fun, Ken Jeong does a good job as host, really enjoyed Cheryl Hines as a mainstay judge and Niecy Nash was also really fun in her appearances... It just needs something else to avoid becoming stale/predictable."

Saying that is as suss as an overweight woman trying to claim that we need to promote ""Rubenesque"" physiques because that's the ""real"" standard for attractiveness because fertility."

5036,2020-12-26 15:08:28,kk5vyu,"You're correct. He has features that are factually more common among whites than East Asians and valued in modern Asian beauty standards, such as a tall nose bridge and deep-set eyes.

When even we, as a male dominated sub for woke Asians, are promoting guys like this one, we shouldn't be surprised why less woke people white worship so much."
5037,2020-12-26 09:47:12,kk5vyu,"Don't know why you're being downvoted.

He really does not look like your typical east or south-east asian guy."

5041,2020-12-26 16:45:34,kk5vyu,"Ken Jeong as a comedian/actor often relies on Asian jokes/stereotypes (how often do you see blacks and whites joking and putting down their race?). 


Why are the Asian jokes so bad? Because essentially they aren't really jokes but under the guise of one, is an excuse to portray us as subhuman, submissive, unattractive, weak, etc. And they get away with it. If you actually meet Asians irl, you notice for the most part they are just normal human beings and aren't one dimensional characters. And since those ""jokes"" are so widely used an circulated by Asians (or even white people) you have people literally disrespecting you just on how you look. No seriously, you'll have strangers or people you barely know cue up an unfunny Asian joke, or even flat out act racist. Besides assholes, I've been in South Korea many times and I've never had to meet these fuckers disrespect me just cause I have an Asian face. 


On the bright side, (anecdote of mine). Most white supremacists and racists are actually either losers or average people. It makes sense after all, people who are ""superior"" in the sense that they are talented, have more achievements,  or have a life don't go around bullying others because they aren't insecure about losing their position/status in life. The white incel on the other hand most definitely is failing in life and to feel as if they have some redeeming quality, they become white supremacists who are so sad that in order to feel better, they have to quote the achievements and successes of other people on the basis that they have the same skin tone and it actually ends up holding them back."

I‚Äôm not disagreeing with you on the fact that the movie is blatantly racist, however we have to keep in mind the entire film revolves around Kim Jong Un who is arguably a bigger piece of shit than the execs that approved this movie. Seth Rogen also openly admitted that he regrets being apart of this movie which is very rare for Hollywood actors"

5058,2020-12-27 03:37:20,kk5vyu,"Im not saying hes not 100% asian, but his features are uncommonly asian, large nose w/ high straight bridge is not commonly present among east asians"
5059,2020-12-26 17:40:17,kk5vyu,A possibility but ppl have been speculating for years that he's gay. Nothing wrong with that.

Fallen Angels has touching performances, witty dialogue, expressive cinematography and an evocative soundtrack. I saw it as a young man and it was my favourite film for a long time."
5061,2020-12-25 21:33:27,kk5vyu,What do you think happened with BTS? They've been successful because their fanbase shared their music. You think it's because the American media decided to play some Korean music over the radio?

I'm Viet and my nose bridge is high and straight and my nostrils are narrow and I've never had a nosejob. I see many Koreans, Northern Chinese and Japanese have a similar nose to Takeshi."

My mother only heard about BTS's name after dancing to one of their mainstream songs in a gym. They were late and caught in when the guys performed live. My mother asked me for information on them since I keep up with these kinds of things."
5071,2020-12-25 21:51:20,kk5vyu,"Yes, what do you think happened with BTS? White people became powerful and influential because they're 2/3 of the population. Why else do you think they hate immigration so much? It cuts into their power the fewer there are of them."

Western corporations also now have no choice but to cater to China which is why the whiny westerners are stomping their feet because of a loss of their power. Asians are already doing plenty.

5135,2020-12-17 04:03:21,keolbi,"My first thought was vampires from other series...

* **Spike/James Marsters** as a very condescending and much-cooler-than-them fellow vampire? You know the Buffy villain/hero would have to get at least one ""fucking guy"" out of Nandor.
* If we're talking ""dream list,"" imagine the havoc sexy **Eric Northman/Alexander Skarsgard** could create amongst the roommates, with his trademark True Blood swagger. 
* I'd absolutely die laughing if they could get any of the Twilight vampires on screen -- remember Nandor wearing glitter for the Baron early on? -- especially if they're basically trying to make ""vegan vampires"" out of them (say, **Alice/Ashley Greene** and **Jasper/Jackson Rathbone** showing up like undead Jehovah's Witnesses to convince them to switch from human blood to animal blood).

Then there's also the other paranormal entities, like:

* Witches from the original cast of The Craft, particularly **Nancy/Fairuza Balk** and **Sarah/Robin Tunney**. They'd be legitimately scary -- what if they came looking for The Cursed Hat because it was their ancestor?
* Old school **Sabrina/Melissa Joan Hart** or one or more of the sisters from **Charmed**. I'm just picturing Nadja at her scornful, foul-mouthed best against more wholesome and easily insulted ""nice witches.""
* **Sam/Jared Padelecki** and **Dean/Jensen Ackles** of Supernatural, perhaps passing through while hunting more  threatening prey than the housemates? Or the guys trying one of Nadja's incantations and winding up summoning **Crowley/Mark Sheppard**?
* Having some of **the Ghostbusters** show up to deal with the massive haunting created by the fact their estate grounds are a giant burial ground for murder victions?"
5136,2020-12-17 04:13:12,keolbi,"This may be an unpopular opinion, but my wife and I have joked about how funny it would be to see Robert Pattinson on the show.

Also, for anyone who has also watched the Bachelor/Bachelorette... Chris Harrison is 100% an energy vampire and I would love to see him make a cameo as himself."
