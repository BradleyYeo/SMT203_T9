1,2020-02-05 15:58:40,ezbfmi,My entry is already fucked
2,2020-02-05 16:29:14,ezbfmi,No one guessed pitbull üòí
3,2020-02-05 16:02:32,ezbfmi,"DaBaby as a sub? He will get the Migos circa 2017 bud light spot at 5:00, show up 30 min late, and then rock the field for 30. 

The Daft Punk joke never gets old, but if I‚Äôm submitting an actual entry...I‚Äôm not wasting a spot on them."
4,2020-02-05 17:40:46,ezbfmi,New Sub Entry: Porterrrrr
5,2020-02-06 09:01:42,ezbfmi,Damn no Gwen Stefani? That‚Äôs who I‚Äôm really hoping for.
6,2020-02-05 15:54:52,ezbfmi,"damn, I wish i got in on this!!!"
7,2020-02-05 15:56:06,ezbfmi,I bet young thugs on the lineup
8,2020-02-05 16:58:36,ezbfmi,so surprised Galantis or Disclosure didn't make anyone's list here.
9,2020-02-05 17:25:13,ezbfmi,Do people really want to see Lizzo or are they just guessing because she‚Äôs popular recently? Her album was good but I really don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs big enough to headline lolla yet.
10,2020-02-05 15:59:04,ezbfmi,11% of the sub is correct
11,2020-02-05 16:29:46,ezbfmi,u/NikeRafa im disappointed in you
12,2020-02-05 20:38:21,ezbfmi,">The Daft Punk joke never gets old, but if I‚Äôm submitting an actual entry...I‚Äôm not wasting a spot on them.

I mean it's not like there is an actual prize lol it's just for fun"
13,2020-02-05 17:38:18,ezbfmi,"It‚Äôs not a pool of ‚Äúwho do you want to play Lolla‚Äù, it‚Äôs ‚Äúwho do you think is likely to play Lolla‚Äù. Lizzo had a big 2019 and is billed as a headliner at Bonnaroo and Osheaga. It‚Äôs pretty likely she ends up on the Lolla lineup and because she is headlining elsewhere, she wouldn‚Äôt be anything less than a headliner at Lolla."
14,2020-02-05 18:42:51,ezbfmi,"She had ONE big song in 2019 and she rode that wave. I personally do not see her headlining. maybe a sub spot if that, but definitely not able to put up a good crowd at Grant park stage. Maybe i'll be proved wrong here though."
15,2020-02-06 23:41:05,ezbfmi,I don‚Äôt get the hype either but she‚Äôs the first woman to be a headliner at Bonnaroo so if we get her there‚Äôs no way she‚Äôs < Top 8 ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
16,2020-02-05 17:42:14,ezbfmi,"She's big enough to headline Lolla for sure, but I think it only really makes sense if she has an album release between now and then. I saw her at Radio City and it was a FABULOUS show, but really short--she doesn't have enough material to headline a huge venue yet. I don't remember how long the headliners play at Lolla, if it's an hour or so she'd be fine, if it approaches two she'd never be able to do it without another album."
17,2020-02-05 17:53:00,ezbfmi,Most headlines only get 75 minutes tops at Lolla.
18,2020-02-05 15:28:20,ezb1nb,"Saying one of the most popular artists in the US ""isn't bad"" is not a very unpopular opinion."
19,2020-02-07 11:13:57,ezb1nb,"i dont hate her,but saying you dislike her to make her fandom go nuts is hilarious."
20,2020-02-05 15:26:31,ezb1nb,">Y'all just like to complain about what's popular.

Well this *is* r/unpopularopinion. Also, this isn't an unpopular opinion and is a bit on the meta side, so it might get deleted by the mods. But I see where you're going with this and I agree. A lot of these opinions aren't actually outlooks that the OP holds. They're just trying to karma farm by coming up with the next most ""controversial"" thing they can think of."
21,2020-02-05 17:51:51,ezb1nb,Garbage. She whispers when she sings.
22,2020-02-05 15:30:52,ezb1nb,Autotune is not talent. Having 7 grown men help you write your songs is not talent.
23,2020-02-08 17:19:29,ezb1nb,"Tbh, she came out of nowhere, and used quite small amounts of technology, and her brother to make here songs. That is pretty impressive though. But shes not my favorite though"
24,2020-02-05 15:29:08,ezb1nb,She's the boogeyman of incels and right wingers.
25,2020-02-05 15:48:19,ezb1nb,"I mean, I don't entirely disagree, but you're posting this in the wrong sub dude. Try r/popularopinion"
26,2020-02-05 15:35:15,ezb1nb,"It is unpopular for Reddit, considering how many people on this sub alone complain about her."
27,2020-02-05 15:30:31,ezb1nb,"Well I think while bills ellish is popular, definitely not on reddit. So I would consider it to be fine."
28,2020-02-05 15:38:12,ezb1nb,She barely uses autotune and when she does she doesn't do it to cover up bad singing
29,2020-02-05 15:38:23,ezb1nb,Mhmm
30,2020-02-05 15:44:39,ezb1nb,Every big artist uses ut nowadays to cover up slight mistakes in the studio version. Doesn't mean they're bad singers if there is 1 fuckup in a whole song
31,2020-02-05 15:49:56,ezb1nb,"Also newsflash, ""big"" usually means ""trash"" when it comes to music these days."
32,2020-02-05 15:49:33,ezb1nb,"No they don't. You can tell because you'll actually hear the fuckups.

Whereas with autotune you obviously don't."
33,2020-02-05 15:52:02,ezb1nb,"No it doesn't. I don't like what's on the charts, but there is a difference between not liking music and objectively looking at it. Objectively popular songs have quality to them"
34,2020-02-05 15:50:18,ezb1nb,Search for a false note in any popular song
35,2020-02-05 15:54:59,ezb1nb,"No they really fucking don't. The same 3 guys write all the songs for all the artists. No real instruments are used. The lyrics are just the same 20 words rearranged (baby, love, need, you, me, forever, together, etc)

It's bad. Really bad."
36,2020-02-05 15:50:51,ezb1nb,Dude popular music fucking sucks. It isn't real music.
37,2020-02-05 16:04:43,ezb1nb,"1. It really doesn't matter who writes the songs as long as they're good and the artists have artistic freedom to alter the songs (if they are handed to them cuz most of the time they do write their music themselves) 
2. Synthesizers are instruments and it's not like that's the only thing being used
3. Not true, yeah they write a lot of love songs cuz that's what sells but it's most of the time a metaphore or based on their experiences"
38,2020-02-05 15:52:37,ezb1nb,Yes it is
39,2020-02-05 16:06:02,ezb1nb,"How does it not matter? You're sitting there relating to an artist thinking omg she knows how I feel, 

When in reality the song was written by some 50 year old formula song writer.

Synthesizers are great. But I don't consider someone talented if they don't write play or sing. WTF MAKES YOU AN ARTIST IF YOU DON'T DO ANY OF THE THINGS ARTISTS DO.

They're poster boys/girls. Not artists."
40,2020-02-05 15:53:36,ezb1nb,Great argument. Solid.
41,2020-02-05 16:14:51,ezb1nb,Someone writing a song to give it to a lable happens sometimes but not often. Most of the time they write their music themselves and the other writers just help. And who are these mysterious people who don't write play or sing
42,2020-02-05 16:53:43,ezb1nb,"Imo, music is sound. If the singer relies on auto tune/background music but creates good songs and sound from it, I‚Äôll call them a good artist. Take Ariana Grande, she uses auto tune and lots of background music but she creates great songs that give of life vibes and amazing surreal sound. So I‚Äôll have to disagree with you"

65,2020-02-05 15:41:59,ez70fu,"Omg this is so true. I am you typical edgy 15 girl that listen to emo music. And guess what? I just got diagnosed with depression. It was so hard for me to accept it, because I just assumed I was faking it"
66,2020-02-05 15:29:54,ez70fu,"Idk, I‚Äôll get some shit probably but I can easily tell when someone is mentally ill due to genetics and mentally ill due to trauma. I‚Äôm gonna assume Billie E is all trauma based. I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs mentally ill either, she‚Äôs a fucking teenager. I remember when I was 17 and I would give myself to 23 before I threw in the towel. I forgot I told myself that 3 weeks later. She‚Äôs 100% trying to uphold an image, whether it‚Äôs on her or her label forces her too, idk. I‚Äôm a firm believer in you can‚Äôt truly comprehend life until you‚Äôre 25, because your brain is still growing. I‚Äôve experienced it in my own life. The things I comprehend now at 29, no fucking way could my brain could comprehend at 17, fuck even 22-23 probably couldn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm gonna assume there is some family abuse trauma thrown into her life somewhere and she wears it on her sleeve. Not saying she shouldn‚Äôt, but the more she wears her trauma/baggage as an image appeal, it‚Äôs never gonna go away. I personally think she‚Äôs just gonna be a case of the childhood star. She‚Äôs gonna look back in 10 years and regret all her emo shit, or maybe not since that shit made her millions. 

I feel like mentally illness is definitely thrown around a lot now as a scape goat because of the shooters in America and people killing themselves. I work with mentally ill clients as a living, people that generally can‚Äôt operate in society because their brain doesn‚Äôt work in a way that supports them in the society they live in. If you‚Äôre a millionaire musician, you‚Äôre not mentally ill, you might have issues but they are issues that can be resolved, and drug addiction (even though I work in it) is not a mental illness TO ME. To me it‚Äôs a sign of the times, a shit economy, no jobs worth working for a humane quality of life, high costs, low pay, not everyone wants to work in tech or become an engineer (since those are the trendy high paying jobs today). Drugs make you feel amazing, they escape you from the shit situation you‚Äôre in (that most of the times are out of your control), so of fucking course someone is gonna resort to feeling good when everything around them is bad. So the drug epidemic in America to me is a sign of the times and not a mental illness. If these people woke up everyday, had a close not family, experienced very little trauma, very little hardship, had a well paying job that enjoyed, I bet you on my life, they wouldn‚Äôt resort to drugs. Yea you can still become a millionaire musician, but you‚Äôre past will always haunt you until you deal with it or quit caring about it. 

I believe mental illness because I‚Äôve seen it, it‚Äôs so obvious but I 100% think it‚Äôs used a scapegoat today. I don‚Äôt think the school shooters have a mental illness, I think they are also a sign of the times. I‚Äôm not blaming video games, but video normalize violence (I‚Äôve been playing violent games since I was 5-6). These kids have absent parents, these kids aren‚Äôt gonna talk to their parents about their problems, violence is normalized by everything that surrounds them, My girlfriend and all her friends are teachers, I talk to them about their job/hear from them all the time. The education system is a FUCKING JOKE, I‚Äôm surprised more people don‚Äôt ban together to do something about America‚Äôs education system, these IEP counselors don‚Äôt know shit when a kid comes to school whose dad is always getting arrested, or themselves or someone in their family is getting physical/emotionally abused in the home.  I‚Äôm not surprised one bit they go on a shooting spree when they feel they have hit a low emotional due to their environment.  Their brains are working exactly how it should in their moment, not saying it‚Äôs right, I‚Äôm saying I feel their brains have been conditioned, they were not born that way at birth like some people that can‚Äôt operate, that have insane bi-polar/schizophrenia tendencies. In my career, they are plainly obvious/vastly different. 

Like I said, this is all a product of the times, instead of people pushing ‚Äúmental illness, can‚Äôt help it‚Äù they need to answer more complex questions, which are never gonna get answered, our country is built on greed, I don‚Äôt see it happening in my life time. I‚Äôm not saying I have an answer, I think history is too tarnished for us to reinvent stuff that‚Äôs probably  ingrained in our DNA now. I think to put it simple, everything needs to be equal in life, but the Ying/Yang concept is universal, so breaking that cycle is something we need to work towards. As long as there is that one person that wants more than the other person, it‚Äôs never ever gonna change. 

I went on a rant, hope I made sense."
67,2020-02-05 23:29:50,ez70fu,You‚Äôre valid. I just want you to know that. Please don‚Äôt ever doubt your feelings and emotions.
68,2020-02-06 05:25:12,ez70fu,"I don‚Äôt know why people are downvoting you. I agree with a lot of what you said. 

Money doesn‚Äôt fix everything, but it sure goddamn helps."
69,2020-02-07 00:16:38,ez70fu,Maybe because their comment was pretty ignorant? Just a guess though.
70,2020-02-05 09:51:51,ez6rzy,"There were a few pretty large and relatively mixed-opinion posts on this sub when the announcement was made. Personally I don‚Äôt know too much of her music, although most of the commenters that did said her general ‚Äústyle‚Äù is quite different than ‚ÄúBad Guy‚Äù, her most popular song. I personally am excited simply because it represents something new for the series that we haven‚Äôt seen in a while. If you‚Äôre interested in reading other people‚Äôs opinions just search her name in the sub bar.

I feel like making these kinds of posts, just fishing  for negative opinions or controversy is kinda lame though. Whatever your opinions, saying that she‚Äôs talentless and only famous because of her brother‚Äôs skills is pretty low."
71,2020-02-05 12:10:39,ez6rzy,"The series has had weird, experimental tracks since the Moore era. There's a lot more to Bond music than just booming Shirley Bassey ballads. I think Eilish could bring something unique and fresh and give the series some much needed relevance to younger fans."
72,2020-03-16 02:40:05,ez6rzy,"Half the old people are going to be yelling what is she saying during the beginning of the movie when they can't hear her whispering gimmick.

It should be given to a more mature artist. A teenager shouldn't be singing for a James Bond movie. Teens don't know the complexities of adult relationships, And neither does Taylor Swift yet either.

I wouldn't mind seeing Katy Perry get it, Love to Adelle getting it. My favorite is the guy from Soundgarden with casino Royale. Next to the Duran Duran one. And McCartney #3."
73,2020-02-05 11:25:48,ez6rzy,"It will probably be bad because she and he brother are composing the song, not the actual composer for the film (Hans Zimmer), so it will end up being totally out of place with the rest of the score.  The best theme songs in the past have be co-composed with the score composer, so I don't know why they don't do it that way anymore."
74,2020-02-05 10:14:17,ez6rzy,"On the one hand, I think it‚Äôs really cool they went with an unknown. On the other hand, she‚Äôs only unknown to me because I don‚Äôt know shit about current popular music. I‚Äôve only ever heard that one song that one the Grammy and I wasn‚Äôt impressed, but I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôs probably a talented singer."
75,2020-02-05 10:02:23,ez6rzy,Terrible choice. No class at all.
76,2020-02-05 09:55:01,ez6rzy,I agree I was maybe overly critical of her on this post. But as a music producer myself and knowing that finneas her brother wrote most of her biggest hits I have to give him recognition! But Yeha I don‚Äôt mind Billie she can sing very well no doubt. I‚Äôm just Intrested to see how her soft voice works out on a bond theme as most of the other singers who have been on the soundtrack are powerhouse singers
77,2020-02-05 12:30:02,ez6rzy,Hopefully this is what happens. But I just think voices like Sam smith and Adele fit the bond theme so much more. But I don‚Äôt wanna jump the gun! We will see!
78,2020-03-16 11:54:01,ez6rzy,"Taylor swift doesn‚Äôt even have a goood voice tho it‚Äôs generic af. At least Billie has something unique going. The song has grown on me massively however I agree with your points for sure but oh well it‚Äôs done now. There were deffo artists that are more fitting but at the end of the day the movie business is a ‚Äòbusiness‚Äô and Billie eilish and Finneas (her brother) are the most talked about and popular artists in the world atm and they just won like 10 Grammys between them. 

I agree it‚Äôs not the best choice but I get it for business reasons tho! I deffo wouldn‚Äôt choose Katy Perry üòÇ I do like her but she fits the vibe worse then Billie tbh. Imo the best choice of singer for this movie would have been Lana Del Rey she‚Äôs perfect. If you don‚Äôt know her check out the song she sang for the great gatsby ‚Äòyoung and beautiful‚Äô she would have been the perfect fit. And she‚Äôs older"
79,2020-02-06 04:43:12,ez6rzy,Zimmer and Eilish have both acknowledged in interviews that they‚Äôve met and collaborated.
80,2020-02-05 11:35:07,ez6rzy,I pray that they are only composing for that one song? Haha
81,2020-02-05 10:15:49,ez6rzy,Hahahahaha Yeha I think it‚Äôs just because you don‚Äôt listen to current music. She‚Äôs more famous then sam smith who sang the theme and almost as famous as Adele. She‚Äôs probally the most famous artist in the world atm so she‚Äôs deffo not an unknown üòÇüòÇ
82,2020-02-05 10:17:20,ez6rzy,And if your talking about bad guy? Tbf most of her music could work and is very ‚Äòbond themed‚Äô bad guy is the exception ahha. Most of her other music is soft and emtjonal. However I still wouldn‚Äôt have chosen her to sing the theme but hey let‚Äôs give it a chance and see how it is
83,2020-02-05 10:03:05,ez6rzy,You don‚Äôt need class to sing the theme üòÇ. They don‚Äôt show her haha. You just need to sound good and fit the sound
84,2020-02-05 11:30:09,ez6rzy,"This is also true.  Bond has become so watered down throughout this Craig era that it's now just another generic big budget action series like Fast and Furious where they just choose some generic popular music to play during the credits.  Even if the song ends up being okay on its own, there will be nothing Bond-like about it.  It will just be any other top 40 pop song on the radio."
85,2020-02-05 12:05:26,ez6rzy,"I hadn‚Äôt heard of her before this. Sam Smith on the other hand, as dreadful as he is, is very famous. Maybe it depends on where you are. I‚Äôm in the UK"
86,2020-02-05 10:18:19,ez6rzy,I had no idea who Sam Smith was either. Still don‚Äôt.
87,2020-02-05 10:20:07,ez6rzy,"Maybe they chose her because Bond is a tough guy, who likes it very rough guy. Also, he eats bacon, and likes martinis shaken."
88,2020-02-05 10:45:19,ez6rzy,"I disagree with that. Style and class is what we would like to associate James Bond with. Her personality, style and message just doesn't suit the Bond brand."
89,2020-02-05 11:31:52,ez6rzy,"How is she going to ""fit the sound"" when she doesn't even know what Han Zimmer's score sounds like and has not collaborated with him at all?  That's like taking a shot in the dark.  There's a very small chance it could work, but it's highly improbable that her theme song will fit in with the rest of the score."
90,2020-02-05 12:12:22,ez6rzy,You do realise the last two songs won Oscars right? The producers know what they're doing. Bond music has had a broad mix of stylish ballads and contemporary pop over the past 50+ years. It's never been married to one style.
91,2020-02-05 18:34:39,ez6rzy,"Before Craig we had 

-Madonna
-Garbage
-Sheryl Crowe
-Tina Turner 
-Gladys Knight
-Aha
-Duran Duran

Only two of those I wouldn‚Äôt call generic pop"
92,2020-02-05 16:30:16,ez6rzy,Daniel Craig is my favoruite bond hoesntly and he is too many people. And casino royale is my favoruite bond film. Even if you prefer the classic bonds theres no denying craig has done a great job
93,2020-02-05 12:28:58,ez6rzy,Why do u not like Sam smith üòÇ
94,2020-02-05 12:28:23,ez6rzy,Billie Elish is much more famous then Sam smith but yes she an American artist and Sam it British.   I‚Äôm also from the uk but Billie is global. Everyone knows her name
95,2020-02-05 10:18:43,ez6rzy,Surely u know who Adele is at least üòÇ
96,2020-02-05 10:19:29,ez6rzy,Even if you don‚Äôt listen too popular music you would have heard some of these artists music on the radio or in a store as they play them 24/7 so it‚Äôs inevitable
97,2020-02-05 10:19:39,ez6rzy,What music do u listen to?
98,2020-02-05 10:46:00,ez6rzy,Yeha but all you hear is her voice and u don‚Äôt see her in the film. Her voice could suit it potentially
99,2020-02-05 18:31:28,ez6rzy,A band called Garbage once did the theme song and it was great
100,2020-02-05 11:35:47,ez6rzy,Some guy replied to this post and said that apparbelty Hans Zimmer isn‚Äôt composing this one. He‚Äôs composing the rest but finneas and Billie are doing this entire song
101,2020-02-05 11:35:58,ez6rzy,Which could mean it‚Äôs even less bond üòÇ
102,2020-02-05 13:13:21,ez6rzy,"I think it has been decades since winning an Oscar really meant anything.  I don't see that as an endorsement at all.  Just look at the crap that is nominated this year.

I think it's hilarious that out of all the great Bond songs over the years, it is Adele's mediocre Skyfall and Smith's horrendous Writing on the Wall that won Oscars.  That tells you all you need to know about the poor tastes of the Academy."
103,2020-02-05 13:30:39,ez6rzy,"I‚Äôm not a fan of pop music; I do my best to avoid it. But some musicians are ubiquitous, and Sam Smith is one of them. I‚Äôve honestly never heard of this girl before, however, or her music."
104,2020-02-05 10:21:56,ez6rzy,I do.
105,2020-02-05 10:21:24,ez6rzy,Music old people like.
106,2020-02-05 13:10:33,ez6rzy,"Yes, and that's my point.  Zimmer is composing the main film score which is going to have a certain sound to it, but Eilish and her brother are composing only the theme song, so the theme will sound totally out of place alongside Zimmer's score."
107,2020-02-05 16:28:59,ez6rzy,Skyfall is an absolutle bond classic and a triumph ahha. It is the most bond soundng song ever and its perfect with the scene. But music is subjective so to each their own
108,2020-02-05 16:31:01,ez6rzy,Fair play. She is very famous these days
109,2020-02-05 10:24:35,ez6rzy,"I find her pretty easy listening tho honestly on most songs apart from bad guy. Like I could see her singing in this style working on bond https://youtu.be/pbMwTqkKSps

But I think there were better choices"
110,2020-02-05 16:24:05,ez6rzy,yeah I agree. Stupid idea
111,2020-02-05 10:30:47,ez6rzy,She definitely has a nice voice. But this song did nothing for me.
112,2020-02-05 10:31:26,ez6rzy,Totally fair. I‚Äôm not blown away by her either. But who knows maybe the bond song will be good. I‚Äôve loved all the other bond songs!
113,2020-02-05 10:34:08,ez6rzy,I‚Äôve liked a good 85%
114,2020-02-05 07:40:32,ez5xai,"her fanbase is pretty young, so a lot of the Billy Eilish zeitgeist is cringe 

nothing wrong with her at all imo, I think she's super cool and her music is rad."
115,2020-02-05 07:41:20,ez5xai,No quarrel. She's ok. Just not feeling her music.
116,2020-02-05 07:43:07,ez5xai,People have a quarrel with her? I think her music's alright: not something I actively listen to but it doesn't make me change the radio station either.
117,2020-02-05 07:40:14,ez5xai,Is there a quarrel?
118,2020-02-05 07:39:39,ez5xai,Just fucking annoying
119,2020-02-05 07:58:51,ez5xai,Who?
120,2020-02-05 07:40:03,ez5xai,I understand that she's being marketed as the anti-sex girl but does she seriously have to dress like a 9 year old boy from the early 90s?
121,2020-02-05 07:40:41,ez5xai,None. Just another attention whore is all.
122,2020-02-05 16:30:14,ez5xai,I see people roasting her on the daily
123,2020-02-05 07:42:17,ez5xai,Yes because she has big boobs and she just turned 18.
124,2020-02-05 08:41:44,ez5xai,That‚Äôs a bit much.
125,2020-02-05 07:43:51,ez5xai,What?
126,2020-02-05 08:42:25,ez5xai,No it's not. It's exactly right on target.
127,2020-02-05 07:45:52,ez5xai,Yup. I mean I'm a boy working to have pecs but half of the girls I know who have big boobs hide them because that's what everyone else will see them as.
128,2020-02-05 08:45:19,ez5xai,Welp. That‚Äôs your opinion but I think she‚Äôs just doing her.
129,2020-02-05 07:47:21,ez5xai,"Yes I understand why she's not dressing provocative. I don't understand why that means she has the fashion sense of a small, male child"
130,2020-02-05 08:46:29,ez5xai,That's because you're just another mindless sheeple.
131,2020-02-05 07:47:47,ez5xai,"""There are two genders."""
132,2020-02-05 07:49:45,ez5xai,Oh fuck off
133,2020-02-05 07:53:10,ez5xai,I used quote marks for sarcasm. Sorry if I sounded transphobic.
134,2020-02-05 07:35:50,ez5uy4,Who is Van Halen ?
135,2020-02-05 12:27:55,ez5uy4,Not really she was already immensely popular but that was such a dumb controversy Van Halen haven‚Äôt been relevant in my life time I know the name but I don‚Äôt know any of their songs of the top of my head

139,2020-02-05 12:26:03,ez5uy4,Did she actually not? That's embarassing. I knew my suspicions about her were warranted.
140,2020-02-05 07:39:54,ez5uy4,Not Van Hagar
141,2020-02-05 07:47:24,ez5uy4,"That‚Äôs correct for $200, and you get to choose the next answer on the board."
142,2020-02-05 07:41:27,ez5uy4,"Bro, I‚Äôm 31 and know them offhandedly very well.

However, neither of these assertions relate at all to my OP."
143,2020-02-05 12:27:39,ez5uy4,Are you a professional musician from LA?
144,2020-02-05 07:50:08,ez5uy4,"My point wasn‚Äôt to criticize her, but to precisely pinpoint when she crossed into mainstream consciousness.

I definitely can‚Äôt name all the bands from before I was born, but given that I majored in jazz performance, I could probably name a hell of a lot more bands from 75 years ago than you and her combined.

Also, the band was never called Van Hagar*. That is vocalist Sammy Hagar‚Äôs tribute band. Van Halen, including Halen (and his son now on bass), still exists."
145,2020-02-05 07:44:37,ez5uy4,Nope. She crossed into the mainstream awareness very heavily with her angry response to that Jimmy Kimmel segment. There were a million think pieces the next day that all basically said ‚Äúhow dare a boomer assume a zoomer to be aware of boomer music?‚Äù
146,2020-02-05 14:18:28,ez5uy4,There was nothing wrong about her not knowing.

153,2020-02-05 07:57:21,ez5uy4,Are Europeans supposed to know those stuff are is it just an American thing
154,2020-02-05 07:56:24,ez5uy4,Never heard of those things before man.

156,2020-02-05 08:00:02,ez5uy4,TIL there are people who don‚Äôt know Alex Trebek is bravely fighting stage-4 pancreatic cancer and steadfastly continuing to host the show.
157,2020-02-05 07:59:53,ez5uy4,I know Billie Eilish and Jimmy Kimmel but i never heard of that Jebrek or whatever that thing was or that Jeopardy thing

159,2020-02-05 08:06:32,ez5uy4,I was referring to That dude with stage 4 cancer and Jeopardy but sorry if i triggered you or something
160,2020-02-05 08:11:32,ez5uy4,"I literally just said you know two out of three. That means I *already know* you were referring to That dude. Apologies for not being ‚Äútriggered.‚Äù I also don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs really a pertinent term here, as we‚Äôre not discussing the aftereffects of PTSD.

> Billie Eilish Pirate Baird O'Connell (born December 18, 2001), known professionally as Billie Eilish, is a Grammy Award Winning American singer and songwriter signed to Interscope Records. California singer and dancer debuted her ethereal indie electro-pop sound when she was barely a teenager. Born and raised in Los Angeles, Eilish grew up in a household of actors and musicians and was homeschooled along with her brother Finneas O'Connell (the Slightlys). At the age of eight, she joined the Los Angeles Children's Choir, developing the soulful vocals that would later appear on her early singles. After the release of ""Six Feet Under"" and ""Fingers Crossed,"" Eilish made her breakthrough with ""Ocean Eyes,"" produced and co-written with her brother Finneas and released by Interscope. It surpassed 14 million online streams and spawned a number of remixes with Astronomyy, Blackbear, and Goldhouse. Eilish followed up in February 2017 with ""Bellyache,"" then landed another track, ""Bored,"" on the Netflix series 13 Reasons Why. An EP, dont smile at me, featuring the singles ""COPYCAT"" and ""watch,"" followed later that summer. Her debut full-length album titled ""When We Fall Asleep, Where Do We All Go?"" has been released March 29th, 2019 via Interscope Records. 

> On January 26, 2020, she won five Grammys, including the ""big four"" awards: Best Album, Best Record, Best Song, and Best New Artist. Read more on Last.fm.

162,2020-02-05 09:16:31,ez59ki,This is terrible. Why would you ruin a song like this?
163,2020-02-05 05:35:18,ez4cx6,"I have listened to Billie eilish a little bit before she blew up, and I was blown away just cause of her voice. I don't like her songs, none has any character and they're all pretty much the same but she does have a special voice. I was waiting for her to change her style to find something more suitable for her that shows her capabilities, but you're right the ""attitude"" sells"
164,2020-02-05 16:25:21,ez4cx6,"[Nah.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fvj6PE3gN4o)  (Listen with headphones or on a good stereo, and turn the volume up.)

The girl has talent.  So does her brother, Finneas.  [AFAIK they created all of her music.](https://youtu.be/kpx2-EMfdbg)  Just the two of them and a computer.  No autotune.

Her music isn't tonally complex, but many of her songs have a deep emotional appeal.  The song I posted above is a great example.  It's downright soulful.  No, she isn't Rush or Rolling Stones or Jack White or Oscar Peterson, but her music is creative, unique, and very well done.  Also keep in mind that she's 18.  What were you doing at 18?  I think she has a tremendous talent, and I hope she's just getting started."
165,2020-02-05 16:40:13,ez4cx6,"Could not upvote fast enough. Her music sounds generic albeit with a certain leaning towards an ""occult"" style theme. Neither the music nor the attempt at the Goth image are genuine. Shes following market trends, specifically from within the Hip Hop world, and borrowing them at her leisure. Nothing about her is original."

167,2020-02-05 17:35:21,ez4cx6,"The minimalism aesthetic is something not usually seen on middle-of-the-road radio music, it's usually more of an avant-garde study. Her music bridges that aesthetic to popular appeal. And her success is timing too, because she basically picked up where Lorde left off with ""Royals."" Our culture then began a fascination with precocious adolescents doing minimalistic, darker music."
168,2020-02-05 22:20:02,ez4cx6,"Since Billie has won Grammys, Lana Del Ray should too.  Billie's music sounds like Lana heavily influenced it.  Lana does the sad boy/girl sound very well.  She really deserved some sort of Grammy for creating a different kind of music."
169,2020-02-05 06:26:07,ez4cx6,"Honestly its the opposite for me, I hate her aesthetic but her music is alright for me. I don't get why she thinks it looks good though, maybe she just wants to have her own sort of style to support her brand??? Not sure"

171,2020-02-05 06:03:24,ez4cx6,I loved a lot of her songs before I knew who she was or what she even looked like. Just heard them on YouTube and downloaded them. Then she blew up. So maybe that's your opinion but its not for millions of people.
172,2020-02-05 07:10:31,ez4cx6,"Im a 26 y.o dude who doesnt follow whats mainstream music. I listen to just about every genre of music and when i first heard her songs a couple months back i genuinely think shes very good

I think she deserves all the praise she gets"
173,2020-02-05 11:22:05,ez4cx6,"Another Billie Eillish post...  


Shes got a unique vibe and characteristics that teenagers and young audiences engage with. Some of her songs are pretty alright but it's a new wave and type of Pop music and I think its good to have different flavors in the musical ice-cream."

176,2020-02-06 02:10:03,ez4cx6,"It's not really my kind of music so I'm not really a good judge, but her vocal performance feels ""flat"" to me. Like she's reading a grocery list. IDK I mostly listen to Power Metal though so maybe that's why it seems flat to me. Everything comes across as bland next to GLORY! HAMMER!"
177,2020-02-06 02:25:06,ez4cx6,"she actually has a really amazing voice, she just doesnt show it off in most of her music for style reasons i guess?"
178,2020-02-05 11:34:19,ez4cx6,">(at 17, suggesting she'll seduce older men lmao)

Thank God I wasn't the only one to find this shit ridiculous ü§£ü§£

People just like her because, since she doesn't look like your regular popstar, if you like her, you are ""different"" and ""unique"". This is literally nothing new

Edit: spelling error"
179,2020-02-05 07:20:22,ez4cx6,"Two things I know: 

1/ Music is art 

2/Art is subjective

Things I think (but don't know):
 I have an idea of what good music is and i'm sure you do to but I can almost garauntee our opinions would differ because they are just that.. opinions. Unless you can properly define ""good music"" your sentiment could apply to any popular artist and it would argueably be just as true. 

Btw I actually agree with you for the most part about Billie but i was eventually persuaded to this slightly more holistic conclusion after having this very arguement/discussion at work."
180,2020-02-05 05:33:50,ez4cx6,I'm not a big fan of her or modern pop in general but some of her songs are alright.
181,2020-02-05 16:41:32,ez4cx6,Instrumentals are good.. But her voice and lyrics leave a lot to be desired.
182,2020-02-05 17:01:52,ez4cx6,Yup.
183,2020-02-05 17:02:37,ez4cx6,I am quite fond of her. She doesn‚Äôt have to be cookie cutter with an amazing voice to earn your respect. She just has to be her. And who are you to say she‚Äôs milking anything? You sound like you‚Äôre in an echo chamber with all this recent Billie Eilish hate. Grow up. Stop paying attention to her if you don‚Äôt like her or her music.
184,2020-02-05 17:33:32,ez4cx6,"Ngl I can't stand people who say ""They only popular cause of that"" Yes they are popular because of that, and why are u not popular? Cause u don't have that."
185,2020-02-05 17:42:14,ez4cx6,"It‚Äôs just pure bandwagon effect, it‚Äôs what puts shitty music at the top. Everyone is too afraid to have a mind of their own cus they want to fit in on social media essentially. That‚Äôs the way I see it."

188,2020-02-05 18:26:33,ez4cx6,not an unpopular opinion? literally go on any subreddit that discusses her and everyone says that her fans are just 13 year old girls who think they're depressed because they felt a little sad once in their life.
189,2020-02-05 19:13:14,ez4cx6,Eh her music isn't for everyone. I like it but it's whatever.

193,2020-02-06 02:43:14,ez4cx6,"I think her music is pretty in line with current trends in what‚Äôs popular in music right now. For example there are a huge amount of mumble rappers, and she‚Äôs just taken that to the pop world. If you not super up to date she won‚Äôt appeal to you, but that doesn‚Äôt mean she‚Äôs bad."
194,2020-03-29 03:46:53,ez4cx6,"I think she's popular because she's different from the trap rap crap. 

That being said, her music isn't anything special.

I **mildly** enjoy some of her music."

203,2020-02-05 05:36:29,ez4cx6, I hate everything about her tbh

210,2020-02-05 18:29:44,ez4cx6,"billie eilish is the mumble rap of pop music


she is popular because she was born in a life of privilege to two high ranking music industry executives"
211,2020-02-06 01:32:52,ez4cx6,Like Ariana Grande! Her music is so.e of the most boring I've ever heard.
212,2020-02-06 02:07:50,ez4cx6,"I agree, she sucks"
213,2020-02-05 06:15:30,ez4cx6,"It's all about marketing and branding. There was a distinct strategy and plan put into place to get Billie Eilish where she is now. She's not ""up and coming"" based on anything of her own doing. Her family retained management for her and they did the rest. They literally pretty much says she's an industry plant. Her own managers said it themselves:

"" **BG:** With the internet and social media, the tools are out there for an independent artists to promote their music and brand more than there ever was before. Also, there‚Äôs no one way to develop an artist, so there are so many unique ways an artist can build a base without a label. However, I think that Danny and I both feel that our team at Darkroom and Interscope have played a huge role in Billie‚Äôs success. ""

I do think that Billie would have had success regardless, as she‚Äôs an incredibly talented and unique one-of-a-kind artist. But it‚Äôs undeniable that we have seen so much value globally by having such a powerful system in place of people and partners that have worked tirelessly alongside us to make Billie arguably the most talked-about new artist.

214,2020-02-05 13:59:10,ez4cx6,Couldn't agree more mate
215,2020-02-05 14:53:25,ez4cx6,I think her music is disgusting but then again music is subjective
216,2020-02-05 10:40:28,ez4cx6,I agree her music is a insult to the word music
217,2020-02-05 11:38:19,ez4cx6,She needs to open her mouth more. Singing does not mean half assed rhythmic speaking.
218,2020-02-05 19:13:20,ez4cx6,i thought it was the boobs
219,2020-02-05 20:01:38,ez4cx6,I love her songs and music doesn't sound bland to me at all. However I mostly listen for the lyrics and I like the fact that they're not your typical love/break up songs
220,2020-02-05 22:50:54,ez4cx6,Tim Dillon is that you?
221,2020-02-05 23:25:56,ez4cx6,I think she has a really good voice and deserves all the attention she is getting.
222,2020-02-07 07:37:28,ez4cx6,"You can not like it, but calling it bland garbage sound extremely close minded to me."
223,2020-02-05 07:51:04,ez4cx6,"I mean, her lyrics have very deep meanings, and once you get to know them, they're something different. The reason her songs are different from other ones is that she doesn't necessarily have the ""beat drop"" as most songs do. But that's just what is unique about her songs."
224,2020-02-05 05:27:54,ez4cx6,"Yea, not a fan. But I'm also an old dude and I think her music is offensive to my ears. I do like that new Eminem Godzilla song and I can listen to all of that Post Malone dudes stuff."
225,2020-02-05 05:25:30,ez4cx6,Yes.
226,2020-02-05 11:21:34,ez4cx6,"Her voice is incredibly magnetic and mesmerizing, I feel like there‚Äôs a sort of special aura around her! All this hype is about her look though, but I think it‚Äôs normal when you become popular in the music world. You need an identity and your look is the best way to express it"
227,2020-02-05 13:37:50,ez4cx6,I think you just described all popular music.
228,2020-02-05 12:58:33,ez4cx6,"She's got a voice but her songs are just okay. Before her, Lana Del Rey and Lorde....was Fiona Apple. Fiona Apple is still more talented imo."
229,2020-02-05 14:19:53,ez4cx6,I might be biased since I am a big time queen and generally old music fan but Billie Eilish is good at rythm but bad at melody and harmony.
230,2020-02-05 15:26:58,ez4cx6,"She made a couple of songs I like.. its not really traditional singing but it does fit the music style pretty well. But I also believe its a style that will blow over pretty quickly, there is only so many songs you can do before it becomes repetitive. I mainly just listen to music on the radio so I dont know how half of the artists look. Looked up a Billie Eilish picture recently but I seriously doubt her look has something to do with her popularity"
231,2020-02-05 15:54:11,ez4cx6,Yeah but she got big boobs
232,2020-02-05 17:32:54,ez4cx6,She actually can sing but in her songs she just mumbles because everyone likes that style
233,2020-02-05 05:37:44,ez4cx6,The reason she's popular is because she's relatable. Also put yourself in a at least somewhat sad 14 year old shoes. Then you'll actually kind of get it. It's kind of out of your age range most likely.
234,2020-02-05 08:35:00,ez4cx6,"She's a talented singer, regardless of the individual listener's preferences. The production on her songs is also fantastic thanks to her brother. Personally, I don't see reason to hate on her- aside from a couple of songs gaining traction and being overplayed. üò∂"
235,2020-02-05 06:25:34,ez4cx6,I couldn't identify a single BE song if I were to hear it.
236,2020-02-05 08:38:23,ez4cx6,i think its pretty good :V
237,2020-02-05 13:01:16,ez4cx6,"When you don't know what bedroom pop is you, when you think there are only a handful good genres, when you just don't know what music is, then your opinion is very limited.

There are a lot of things going on in her music, it is very minimal but the way her producer plays with the space is amazing, it is not only about her style or voice there are things that you don't pickup but you still like.

Also, if you don't like it is ok too :)"
238,2020-02-05 11:17:18,ez4cx6,Not un popular ugh do you think you are special hating on a popular artist??
239,2020-02-05 12:15:47,ez4cx6,"obviously  
i mean if you find it bland, it is  
therefore anyoen who likes it more than you has to like it for different reasons  
can't just be that you feel different  
no  
everyone else is the wrong ones"
240,2020-02-05 13:25:44,ez4cx6,"I'm not into pop, but I heard a song or 2 from her. I don't know how she looks like. But her songs are fine, so I can see why she's popular. Also her producer is doing good work. Such a unique sound."
241,2020-02-05 13:49:22,ez4cx6,"But also, Billie has had this style since way before fame and despite how much I dislike her newest album, her voice is still pure sultry goodness."
242,2020-02-05 14:05:43,ez4cx6,"I'm not a huge fan of hers but her queiter, more calm songs are actually nice. 

Check out ""come out and play"" by her, it's a great song."
243,2020-02-05 12:04:05,ez4cx6,I want to hate her. But damn her songs are catchy.
244,2020-02-05 15:23:40,ez4cx6,"I feel you but at least even if you don‚Äôt like it, the girl write about something else than how big is her booty or how good sh√©s at twerking,  she doesn‚Äôt present herself naked or overly sexualised....in today‚Äôs market it will blow most of people les mind because it‚Äôs so unusual."
245,2020-02-05 20:35:08,ez4cx6,"Most of her songs have so much sub bass that 99 percent of the people who hear it won't hear it because it's on the radio and or they don't have decent sound. Putting bad guy on the radio kills it because it was obviously not made for it. 

Also American Beauty is a thing."
246,2020-02-08 14:30:20,ez4cx6,"I think the problem you face is that you're emphatic that a musician, should they decide to sing, has to sing in a certain style. However, I would argue that saying so is kinda anti-art.

Of course, you're allowed to like and dislike any artists you choose, but the way you criticise Billie comes across as you thinking that the general public - that is, the same general public which decided they liked listening to her songs to the point where she became mainstream - are somehow ""incorrect"" for liking an artist you don't like. If people like her stuff, let them like her.

For instance, I personally don't like mumble rap; I can't relate to it and I just prefer other genres. That's my prerogative. However, if other people enjoy and relate to it, that's their prerogative, and it's not fair for me to say that the artists that they enjoy are bad because of whatever system I use for grading music. Taste in music, as is the case with literally every other art form, is subjective to the individual.

To use your example of the song 'bury a friend' (the ""where do we go"" song), I very much enjoy that song. While I agree with you that her singing in this example is not on the same level in terms of vocal technicality as Ariana Grande, I think that the quality of the song comes from the synergy between how she sings and the accompanying music itself. An Ariana-esque whistle tone would not suit that song at all, whereas quiet singing/mumbling does. As such, I appreciate the song because of how intrinsic it is to Billie's style, and because it's a very different sound when compared to what I, personally, would listen to. However, that's just my view, and I don't expect everybody to share it or agree with it. Again, taste in music is subjective.

I've already written a lot, so I won't dwell too long on her aesthetic. However, the same rule applies - you may think her aesthetic is overdone and outdated, and that's fine. That's your opinion. On the other hand, I - alongside very many other people, I'm guessing - enjoy her aesthetic, and that's our opinion. As I've said twice before, art is subjective, and everyone is allowed to think what they want about her aesthetic choices, and nobody is objectively wrong for having their opinions.

Rather than making objective statements about any artist regarding whether or not they 'deserve' their popularity, at least try to respect the fact that people are allowed to appreciate whatever music they like. Clearly, people like what Billie is putting out, regardless of why you think they shouldn't."
247,2020-02-05 13:09:04,ez4cx6,I don't like either but hey i listen to sabaton everyone has a different taste but i hate how popular some songs can become without me knowing anyone who loves the songs
248,2020-02-05 14:42:17,ez4cx6,Her live performances really changed my outlook on her music.  She is incredibly talented.
249,2020-02-05 10:10:58,ez4cx6,She sounds better than she looks

252,2020-02-05 06:30:31,ez4cx6,"her voice just seems overly ""moany"" Idk how else to describe it, it just seems try hard. Lorde makes similar music, I wouldn't ever voluntarily listen to her, but I'd enjoy it more often than not. She actually sang & her message gets across, she's got melody too. BE just doesn't have much of that. her whole thing's like ""look how much idc"""
253,2020-02-05 14:08:03,ez4cx6,What voice? She literally mumbles and you can hardly understand her. Listen to some real music and then tell me you like her voice.
254,2020-02-09 19:01:52,ez4cx6,">Also keep in mind that she's 18.  What were you doing at 18?  I think she has a tremendous talent, and I hope she's just getting started.

Not really a fair comparison. She‚Äôs an industry plant. Not saying she isn‚Äôt talented, but most people don‚Äôt have that privilege."

256,2020-02-06 07:28:59,ez4cx6,"Not to mention Lana also has multiple kinds of songs. Like Ghetto Baby doesn't even sound like it's from the same artist as Cola or 13 Beaches, but somehow it is and she pulls it off."
257,2020-02-05 11:30:17,ez4cx6,"I like that she likes her style and is taking a more non sexual approach than previously famed young people. That being sid it isn't for me. The music I really dig and what I feel its promoting to younger people. It's a fresh, mininalistic breath on what I feel had become a very one-track radio, and that she is telling people it's okay to have issues and talk openly about  them is great, I think."

I just really think she's quite good and given her and her brothers age, I think they absolutely deserve praise for what they've managed to do in such a short time."

I appreciate good production and sonic variety, which you don't generally get from the mashed noise deathcore gives, which I also like.

I was a pop hater at some point, now you can see me listening to old Brtiney shit, some Ariana grande, a couple of Taylor swift songs, I look for the producer work than can only happen when a song is empty and air headed, you should try to listen with out judging, I highly recommend it"

There's really no evidence that I can show you that she has capability in her voice, you can also believe whatever you want.

In choir singing and solf√®ge they teach us various ways to practice and ace the notes in a way that we sound clear. Unfortunately, English is not my native language and so my description in all of this is pretty bad. You don't have to pay attention to see that she has great control, and I am referring to live signing not autotuned tracks. She has control, which can be mostly accomplished with practice, but she also has a unique range that's what makes her ""angelic"" . As I said before her songs are edgy, depression stuff that are mostly for teenagers that say ""ugh I'm such an outcast"" or something. Yet, you need to be able to distinguish some things. The girl has voice and that's it ."

She's talking about the difference between playing a character in your music and just straight up bullshitting to make yourself look cooler. 

Tracks like Tyler's 48 or Pigs, her bury a friend or Lupe's Alan Forever are good examples, they're obviously not true stories but that doesn't take away from how good they are. 

Rappers like smokepurpp who rap about having glocks in his Benz, keeping it tucked and never lacking, pouring up and trapping out of his hotel when in reality he was a pretty boy on facebook and gets run up on by Russ. Imagine hearing kids loving that music and knowing in your head he's a Steve Urkel type, it'd rub me the wrong way too

You can tell a story just to tell a story or you can make a song just to get lit or have fun to. You don't need to be completely honest in your lyrics all the time.

This is literally no different than what she talked about in her Apple Music description of her album about writing from the perspective of somebody she hurt when she was the one who did it. That's ""lying"" if we go down that road. If a rapper wants to be a derivative mafioso or trap god, there's a truth there too. It also doesn't mean anything as far as what the music sounds like, good or bad.

Billie is a creative teenager who just hit the super mainstream, strap in because she's gonna have a lot of wild hot takes over the next few years. Just remember where it's coming from."

463,2020-02-05 03:48:11,ez28x9,"I'm some of the way towards agreeing with you, but I would say that hip-hop, as a genre, has fetishized 'authenticity' enough that it only has itself to blame if it gets criticized as a whole for being a bit fake. I can't think of many feuds between two rappers, for example, which didn't feature at least one calling out the other for not really owning a gun/being in the streets/driving the cars from their videos/being ready to fight/fucking supermodels or similar.

I guess I think that, fundamentally, Eilish is only looking at rap music through a frame that has been built, mainly, by people in rap music themselves."
464,2020-02-05 04:02:29,ez28x9,"Garbagio take here guys, please don‚Äôt upvote this. Rap has always been about what‚Äôs ‚Äúreal‚Äù and what‚Äôs ‚Äúfake‚Äù and having real street credentials has always been a bragging point in the genre."

469,2020-02-05 04:37:00,ez28x9,">*""Why are people allowed to have opinions on things they aren't a part of?""*

It's because there's no qualification to have an opinion on something. Whether or not it's valid is a different question.

But one could argue that Billie Eilish has probably had more real life interaction with many of the rappers that we listen to just being adjacent to the scene, and someone in that position is going to have more insight into the real life and personality of these rappers, and therefore a more accurate opinion than anyone in this thread.

Should we not be allowed to have an opinion on healthcare if we're not doctors?
opinions on cars if we're not mechanics?
opinions on *music if we're not artists*?

Real life doesn't work like that."

Generic, tired and (self admittedly) racially insensitive quote about the content of popular hiphop which she happened to dip a toe into for her own clout and fame. Like she threw Jordans on and hopped on a Mike Will beat, hit the court and really rode that hype at the time, Billie has done nothing like that apart from biting some fashion choices from older hiphop which I feel like most people do if they're ""fashion conscious"" nowadays.

To me it just shows how she didn't fully understand hiphop if she's making the classic ""cars and girls tho?"" complaint so it seems corny for her to ride the wave like she did. Billie is tight with Denzel, Tyler, Vince etc I think she's already shown more respect to the genre"

Just because you don't relate, doesn't mean a lot of people also don't. In general, people are more likely to connect and become fans of artists they can relate to.   
*""They love me in the hood""*

It's a massive part of marketability and getting to that upper echelon of artists. If people don't connect with you, you're not gonna get far."

Another example is how Post Malone [tried to dismiss the emotional range of hip-hop](http://www.thefader.com/2017/11/20/post-malone-polish-interview-dont-listen-to-hip-hop) in 2017. It's just something I've seen a million times before, it's tiring."

Cole or Kendrick all they want, but where do the trap guys fit in? How do us white guys relate to that? How do I relate to pop stars or metal bands?

Rap fans, especially young fans in particular get very attached to the idea of this person representing me, which I've never understood. To each their own though."

You start to form an idea of who they are as a person based on what they say and how they express their feelings through their music.

Someone who doesn't have that experience can't replicate it though, they can only try to come as close as possible and hope that their aesthetic carries them the rest of the way. I just don't think you can do express something you've never done and still have it resonate with people on the same level."

Drake can get away with a bit tbh but I do also agree, he pushes that vibe for the sake of sounding cooler and trendier, fans will say he still hangs with people like Baka but it isn't his true story tbh so it does sound off when he raps that"

Miley and Post criticized rap as a whole for being shallow and emotionless and cheap, despite Miley actively embracing rap culture and hopping in features and Post doing the same. To my knowledge, Billie has never featured in a rap song, and the only rap song she ‚Äúmade‚Äù was a remix to one of her songs that added a Vince Staples feature. So I don‚Äôt think the comparisons of those artists hold any water

And furthermore, what she is saying is vastly different than what Miley and Post were saying. Miley was mocking rap, Post was saying that it was only good for party music. Billie was just saying that rappers are embellishing more than she is, which is completely true and not slander. We literally say that all the time, if rappers actually did all the  gang banging and murder they talk about they‚Äôd all be in jail. Half the reason rap is successful is because everyone is exaggerating about how cool they are. And that‚Äôs FINE, and I think that through that a lot of very real emotions and compelling stories are told. But i think you saw the headline of this story and starting blowing the racism dog whistles without thinking. This is coming from a completely different place than Miley"
540,2020-02-05 07:18:52,ez28x9,"I think you have a bit of a misconception here.
>people do connect with things they don't relate to.


People *absolutely* connect because they relate to it, you don't have to live a similar life to relate to it. Even middle class suburban people can relate to the concept of wanting a better life. They may not have lived a comparable struggle, but the concept of a struggle is relatable.

>Suburban white kids can pretend to relate to J. Cole or Kendrick all they want

For one, you picked two examples of rappers who are known to be very real and genuine in their music, lol.

Two, you're making a hell of an assumption saying they're pretending. You mean a suburban white kid can't relate to Swimming Pools? This statement really shows the misunderstanding here. You're projecting your inability to relate onto everyone, and that's just not true.

>but where do the trap guys fit in? How do us white guys relate to that?

Trap is egotistical music when you boil it down. *I'm the shit, you're not, I get money, I get the bitches, I, I, I...*     
People connect with this because it's empowering. Who doesn't wanna be the shit and get money and bitches? Who *doesn't* relate to that? Pretty fuckin' lame to boil it down to ""how do white guys relate to that?"" like a white people have never sold drugs or wanted these same things. Speaking for myself, yeah, people like that exist and connect to that. Even if they're white and never lived in the hood.

> How do I relate to pop stars or metal bands?

Maybe you're not always supposed to? Metal bands are known primarily a lot of intense emotions like anger, frustration, etc.. People feel these things inside and sometimes need some help getting it out. Pop is what you would probably consider your middle class white people music. But the reality is that it's safe and comfortable, and very much milquetoast for the most part. Pop fans don't @ me."
541,2020-02-05 06:46:04,ez28x9,"Yeah I mean I just listen to so many different people it's hard to ""know"" everyone personally atleast as personal as it can get. I'll definitely say though that the person I do know more about does put the music in a different perspective. 

I guess someone who hasn't experienced can't replicate it the same but idk. I can't help but feel like maybe they could tell it better somehow just by having better story writing. Idk though I'm kind of conflicted. I feel like you could tell a story you've never lived just by being a better story teller or having like a family member be in it but at the same time living it and writing about it is more raw"
542,2020-02-05 07:05:55,ez28x9,"I see your perspective but I think she definitely leans on hip-hop even with her wardrobe, very similar to early 90s era clothing.

If we had a way to literally implant our emotions and experiences 1:1 to another person, this wouldn't be an issue. But in the reality of 2020 we don't have that ^^yet.

I know a lot of people still like SGP's recent shit, there's still communities on like KTT, KTT2 and RYM which absolutely love nearly everything he makes, but I can't really get into his stuff that much. But, I've listened to heaps of projects by him regardless, because there is so much potential with him that I don't think he ever fully realized, even now. I produce beats too and he's been a massive influence on me (the dark trap aesthetic), regardless if I don't care about a lot of his music. 

I enjoy the NASA tape as a whole, and think there's some really good tracks on BLR and Mysterious Phonk, but he's always been quantity over quality and a pretty bad rapper (even worse now).

More people should check out BLR2 - borderline dark ambient trap, production is insane on that. 

But yeah, he's a shit person that won't get help and will most likely never fully realize his potential. Following him on any form of social media will quickly inform anyone on how far gone he is mentally"

i've tried to make beats that sound like his too but to be honest I've never heard any other producer who even comes close. A lot of it what gives it the feeling it does i think is heavy use of atmospheric samples in the background and I have no idea where he sources these from or if there's a delicate art to creating / layering them and whatnot"

Nonsense. That's clearly not what she is saying. She didn't say all rap is is guns and sexism. She said there's a lot of rappers faking it. And that's obviously a true statement. Many in the hip hop community say the same thing."

First up you missesd this context

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a difference between lying in a song and writing a story. There are tons of songs where people are just lying. There‚Äôs a lot of that in rap right now...""

And she's talking about fake gangsters which is huge in hip-hop at the moment, half the songs about 'I got my Draco and I'm pulling up' and yet Russ is sending goons to punch you out üòÇ she has a valid point especially to distance that kind of lying and the 'lying' that Tyler does on songs like 48 or Pigs"

811,2020-02-08 08:51:49,ez0vl6,[this is one of his best songs in that style and one of the best songs of all time](https://youtu.be/q-QC_jsOPQ0)
812,2020-02-05 07:17:03,ez0vl6,"Nah, the mixing on that kind of irked me for whatever reason so I never got through most of it. A lot of his stuff is sloppily mixed, but the mixing on BMW just genuinely annoyed me for whatever reason (maybe the upload on the TRILLPHONK channel is just weird though IDK). 

He uses Ogun a lot for those distinctive 'detuned' pluck sounds which comprise a lot of his recent productions. Here's some tips that I think that work in getting something close to his sounds: atmospheric synths (or slowing down samples, adding reverb, EQIng them so they add atmosphere to the beat but are more 'in the background'), distorting drums instead of compressing them to make them louder so it sounds a bit dirtier, heavy bass, vocal samples (or even just a girl moaning) reverberated alongside flanger effects. Getting crazy with the drums helps too, use a lot of trap rolls and shit.

There's definitely some people who get close to SGP's (current) sound, mostly the BMB Deathrow dudes which makes sense given that its a group run by SGP I think"
813,2020-02-05 07:28:01,ez0vl6,Is Viper serious? It's not supposed to be funny?
814,2020-02-07 19:01:26,ez0vl6,Denzel talked about Purrp‚Äôs mental health to Adam22. Purrp went on a huge tirade against him.
815,2020-02-05 03:06:58,ez0vl6,"That's the problem though. People who call out rappers for being ""fake"" are the same ones who are glad when they see one getting locked up. They blame them for not being real enough then blame them for falling into the trap they encouraged them to go towards.

Edit: obviously I don‚Äôt mean rappers who call out other rappers. Someone like jay-z calling out a rapper for being fake is totally different than someone like billy eilish calling out a rapper for being fake."
816,2020-02-05 07:39:26,ez0vl6,You cant be in a hip hop heads subreddit and actually believe that all rap is just guns and sexism.
817,2020-02-05 11:47:09,ez0vl6,"But, that being said, it doesn‚Äôt make the timing of the comments in relation to this song not sus lol"
818,2020-02-05 04:40:16,ez0vl6,The problem is dudes ain't faking it and are ODing or snitching on themselves and winding up dead or in jail.
819,2020-02-05 02:33:22,ez0vl6,"This. People are trying to go out of their way to take her comments out of context and re frame them like she's saying 'all rap is is guns and bitches', when in reality she's criticizing a lot of the fake shit, which is a different and entirely valid criticism. 

Hell, tons of rappers say the same damned thing, that a lot of these dudes talking about totin' gats and fuckin' bitches have neither."
820,2020-02-05 06:07:15,ez0vl6,A lot of hip hop detractors will criticize it for whatever they feel like at a given time.
821,2020-02-05 02:35:14,ez0vl6,"First of all, everyone already knew this. Secondly capping for subject material to rap/sing about is literally in every genre. Yet I don't see anyone complaining about musicians of other genres lying in their songs. It's always the people hip hop adjacent who got this sly shit to say and it just comes off snarky. Like how post malone was saying this same shit, and he rightfully got dragged.

 Some of the things she sings about didn't actually happen to her, so it's just hypocrisy to try and trash hip hop for the same thing."
822,2020-02-05 02:41:31,ez0vl6,"she's literally just echoing the main critique on new rap, nothing new or revolutionary."
823,2020-02-05 22:07:16,ez0vl6,"That shit is happening in other genres too. Mexicans got Narcocorrido where the music is all about drug trafficking and cartel business, but a majority of them arent living that for real, and I bet most of the fans of that genre arent expecting them to actually live that. People just need to realize music is entertainment. I understand that authenticity is a foundation is rap that people look for, but at the end of the day, why do we care whether this rapper you listen to actually is (or has ever) sold drugs, shot guns, etc? It doesnt really have any effect on the music itself, just as you perceive the artist."

853,2020-02-05 03:16:17,ez0vl6,">People who call out rappers for being ""fake"" are the same ones who are glad when they see one getting locked up

I don't think so. People just like their artists to be genuine. People are looking for someone authentic to listen to when they're surrounded by lying authority figures, employers, and politicians. So they call out shit that doesn't feel authentic because it offends them, even subconsciously."
854,2020-02-05 03:34:06,ez0vl6,"> People who call out rappers for being ""fake"" are the same ones who are glad when they see one getting locked up

legit 0 correlation and just wrong. Almost every rapper calls out fakes, do you really think they like seeing people locked up? tf??"
855,2020-02-05 04:06:19,ez0vl6,"I think you're missing the point. People don't call out rappers as fake because they live a nice life, yet rap about being super hard and people want them to go back to that trap lifestyle. No. The calling them out because the rappers I rapping about the same old shit even though their life has changed tremendously."
856,2020-02-05 08:13:14,ez0vl6,That‚Äôs the opposite of what they said.
857,2020-02-06 02:18:29,ez0vl6,"You actually believe Billie said this because she knew SGP, a man who is by now kinda irrelevant to the music industry, was gonna drop a song with a picture of somebody that looks like her on the cover?"
858,2020-02-05 04:43:59,ez0vl6,Tbh I don't know what possible solution there is. It's such a staple of the genre/culture and it's what people want to hear. I was a huge Chance fan but even I couldn't bring myself to listen to how much he loves his wife for an hour.
859,2020-02-05 02:54:08,ez0vl6,"I agree and I think her opinion is valid. It diminishes the truth of rappers who have really been through it and put their souls on their tracks. 

My only addition would be that all genres with storytelling do this. Pop for example, is super fucking guilty of this and it doesn't get heat for spreading dishonest narratives about the artists' lifestyles."
860,2020-02-05 02:41:51,ez0vl6,"But are artists in other genres saying ‚Äúno cap‚Äù
after their blatant lies?"

863,2020-02-05 08:47:52,ez0vl6,TIL gangsta rap is the equivalent of self insert anime fanfiction
864,2020-02-05 15:40:57,ez0vl6,"Most of her songs are just stories she made up. It's pretty different from straight up lying in a song to sound cool. 

I guess that's hard to notice if Bad Guy is the only song you know from her, though. But typically she makes up a story and sings about it. It's a little different from what she is criticizing here, which is just claiming you're some gangster."

881,2020-02-05 03:18:18,ez0vl6,No but you really think the people who are listening to billy eilish talk about hip-hop are gonna make the distinction?
882,2020-02-05 03:27:36,ez0vl6,Maybe your right I could be wrong. I just don‚Äôt have quite as much optimism when thinking about how billy eilish‚Äôs fan base views hop-hop. I feel like the same people who listen to billy eilish and her opinion on rap are the same people who say shit like ‚Äúwell maybe meek shouldn‚Äôt have been driving that dirt bike on the streets‚Äù
883,2020-02-05 04:31:55,ez0vl6,That wasn‚Äôt really what I meant. Idk I‚Äôm stoned and obviously didn‚Äôt explain my point very well. I should have just said ‚ÄúI think comments like these give fuel to the frat boys who stopped bumping slim Jesus in their lifted f-150 because they found out he wasn‚Äôt bout that life.‚Äù I don‚Äôt think Billie meant anything bad by it. I just don‚Äôt think it needed to be said.
884,2020-02-05 09:28:28,ez0vl6,"Oh I misread the comment, my bad, I'll take the L"
885,2020-02-05 06:16:16,ez0vl6,It's not like those are the two options. There's a lot of things to rap about inbetween drug use and loving your wife
886,2020-02-06 02:23:04,ez0vl6,True but a big part of hip hop is authenticity and the character of the artist. I think that's why other genres can get away with just making stuff up.
887,2020-02-05 03:03:57,ez0vl6,"What? That doesn't mean anything, they lied all the same."
888,2020-02-05 09:02:32,ez0vl6,"I'm talking about the people who say it in contexts like this, in an interview environment."

what she‚Äôs criticizing is kind of music as a whole forever. i mean even look at like older artists, singing about loving and treasuring a woman because it was what sold, but realistically probably cheating on their SO if on tour. michael jackson never wrote a song about little boys. elvis never wrote songs about liking young girls. most music, or entertainment in general, is full of personas. she should understand that."

928,2020-02-05 15:20:11,ez0vl6,You asked ‚Äúwhat rappers sound like blackland radio space ghost‚Äù. I‚Äôm responding to your question with a list of rappers who admitted to being influenced by the tape.
929,2020-02-05 12:26:50,ez0vl6,I think mental illness sucks but theres only a certain amount of shit people can get away with.
930,2020-02-05 04:27:42,ez0vl6,Hip hop is the most popular genre of music today. It‚Äôs certainly been given plenty of respect.
931,2020-02-06 00:27:47,ez0vl6,"... So you're not talking about people who say it in interviews?  What are you talking about then?

Just admit you're wrong lol quit the mental gymnastics."
932,2020-02-05 21:38:57,ez0vl6,"it influenced XXXtentacion, must be a classic"
933,2020-02-05 13:04:50,ez0vl6,Get away with or suffer through?
934,2020-02-05 05:05:05,ez0vl6,"I'd disagree, look at the situation with Noname. She was specifically having a disconnect with her audience because they were people who would just show up to her concerts and consume the music without giving the art form it's due respect or give any thought to the things she was saying. Tons of people listen to hip-hop but don't respect it's history or the artists within the culture."
935,2020-02-06 00:54:47,ez0vl6,"I'm wrong about what? What are you even arguing about, I don't even disagree I just don't think it's something that needs to be said and we don't need people like billie fucking eilish talking trash"
936,2020-02-05 13:34:17,ez0vl6,It can work both ways. She is consistently doing mad things and I dont think it's fair to use mental illness as an excuse. At a certain point you just have to say shes a pretty shitty person.
937,2020-02-05 07:16:23,ez0vl6,I think the same could be said of all genres. Some people just wanna listen to the music on a surface level.
938,2020-02-05 13:36:36,ez0vl6,Why isn't it fair to use that as an excuse if she literally has a mental illness?
939,2020-02-05 13:41:46,ez0vl6,How far can you keep using it as an excuse though? She literally slaughtered animals as a sacrifice? Should we feel sorry for her if she assaults someone? Her behaviour is absolutely horrendous.
940,2020-02-05 13:43:41,ez0vl6,It doesn't outright excuse her behavior but it should command sympathy as it's not like she is in the right state of mind to be making choices you or I believe to be rational and healthy.
941,2020-02-05 13:57:57,ez0vl6,"The line btwn sympathy and indifference is a personal one though, based on your own tolerance, experience, and expectations for people. My sympathy for the mentally ill never wanes in the abstract, but I dont have the capacity to feel exactly as much of it after seeing somebody lash out and impact others in the same way for years. I dont think that's cruelty so much as behaviorism"

> Billie Eilish Pirate Baird O'Connell (born December 18, 2001), known professionally as Billie Eilish, is a Grammy Award-Winning American singer and songwriter signed to Interscope Records. California singer and dancer debuted her ethereal indie electro-pop sound when she was barely a teenager. Born and raised in Los Angeles, Eilish grew up in a household of actors and musicians and was homeschooled along with her brother Finneas O'Connell (the Slightlys). At the age of eight, she joined the Los Angeles Children's Choir, developing the soulful vocals that would later appear on her early singles. After the release of ""Six Feet Under"" and ""Fingers Crossed,"" Eilish made her breakthrough with ""Ocean Eyes,"" produced and co-written with her brother Finneas and released by Interscope. It surpassed 14 million online streams and spawned a number of remixes with Astronomyy, Blackbear, and Goldhouse. Eilish followed up in February 2017 with ""Bellyache,"" then landed another track, ""Bored,"" on the Netflix series 13 Reasons Why. An EP, dont smile at me, featuring the singles ""COPYCAT"" and ""watch,"" followed later that summer. Her debut full-length album titled ""When We Fall Asleep, Where Do We All Go?"" has been released March 29th, 2019 via Interscope Records. 

> On January 26, 2020, she won five Grammys, including the ""big four"" awards: Best Album, Best Record, Best Song, and Best New Artist. On February 18th 2020, she won a Brit Award for International Female Solo Artist and for the first time performed her new Bond theme song ""No Time To Die"" and was joined by composer Hans Zimmer, guitar legend Johnny Marr and her brother Finneas. Eilish is the youngest musician to have ever performed the theme song for a Bond Movie. Read more on Last.fm.

979,2020-03-28 11:29:05,fqi1ze,Agreed. Had this argument in high school once. Dude tried to talk up singers over people who play instruments. Told him that if you hand the average person a mic you get a pretty good chance they‚Äôll do alright....then hand them a guitar and watch the shit hit the fan....
980,2020-03-28 11:17:18,fqi1ze,"Ye ik, there are tens of thousands of very good singers in the world, probably more, as can be seen by the talent shows but still people are amazed when someone sings the classic : American accent (even if they don‚Äôt have one), way to much ‚Äúflair‚Äù when they wiggle between lots of notes for no reason and do a reasonably high note. Much more impressive to play an instrument very well, just because less people are able to"
981,2020-04-19 00:31:28,fqi1ze,It‚Äôs definitely the easiest route. With the most reward. People like singers because every human has a voice and they can relate to it

Title: **Can I make fan art of a celebrity and sell it to make money? Can I make fan art of fictional characters (animated/film/books) and sell it to make money?**

Original Post: 

> As you can tell from the title, I was wondering if it was legal to make fan art of a celebrity (for example Billie Eilish, or BTS) and sell it. I would draw it in my own style, but it is still her. Would it also be legal to make fan art of fictional characters from books, films (like Thor from the Avengers), or animation films, and sell it?

Just think of the words in these songs and then you get a catchy one of the songs stuck in your head and just the words. Idk they do not glorify God and surely effect your behavior whether you realize it or not. Or even your thought life which will come out in your behavior eventually. I pray that you will think about some of the things me and others have mentioned. Ask God, he will give you the right guidance. üíô"
1030,2020-03-28 23:23:16,fq8jwg,Well all these artists praise the devil at some point in their music....think about that for a moment.
1031,2020-03-28 02:08:10,fq8jwg,The question that tops most of these conversations is this. Is what are you doing pleasing or bring you closer to God?
1032,2020-03-30 01:58:33,fq8jwg,I mean tons of artists claim to be Christian....or to love or worship God. It‚Äôs a bit deeper than outward appearances.
1033,2020-03-27 23:34:03,fq8jwg,I think it‚Äôs fine. I listen to all of those artists! I think it‚Äôs a personal conviction thing. If someone thinks it‚Äôs wrong they shouldn‚Äôt listen. I am totally fine with it and enjoy secular music.
1034,2020-03-28 00:27:23,fq8jwg,"Personally, I think not. This is why:

""Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever."" 1 John 2:15-17

Anytime you are curious about things like this, ask yourself what Jesus would do. Would Jesus like this music? I guarantee you that he would NOT. Think of Eminem's recent album title (I'm not going to post it here because it's that bad). I used to listen to Eminem, Billie Eilish, and Twenty One Pilots myself (along with many other artists), but I let it go. Why? Because it is not good for my spirituality! It's like I'm letting Satan fill my head with garbage. It's the same reason I stopped consuming drugs, nicotine, and porn. They are all Satan's tools to disconnect us from God.

Maybe try some contemporary Christian music? I really like Unspoken, Apollo LTD, Big Daddy Weave, Mercy Me, etc."

Second I dont think so if you hang out with things of the world its going to influence you even if you never said it you might think about it more or saying it in your head. Think about it this way whenever you think of doing something ask yourself ""What would Jesus do?"" Would he listen to stuff with bad words? Its something I try to ask myself when faced with a choice. I think you know the answer now through this question god bless and have a good day.   


Since now we are christian we are supposed to be more like jesus by chastening and baptized as well so that is why the question comes into play"
1038,2020-03-28 00:21:10,fq8jwg,Saying ‚ÄúCurse words‚Äù is called cursing because thats what it does. They are acts against good with evil intention. Yes it is bad for you to willingly welcome this type of entertainment in your life
1039,2020-03-30 02:00:09,fq8jwg,Thank you :)
1040,2020-03-29 23:11:51,fq8jwg,Aren‚Äôt some of the members of Twenty One Pilots Christian though? :D

1042,2020-03-27 23:51:08,fq8jwg,Would Jesus do that though?

1055,2020-03-27 22:10:33,fq6gl4,Imagining you teasing your clit for Billie is almost too much.   I'm sure you're not the only girl masturbating to her

1097,2020-04-20 22:54:41,g52g2e,"yeah, i think that happened. probably it isn't q billie eilish song. idk why i think it was. i'll look into my yt history."
1098,2020-04-20 22:07:07,g52box,Not exactly my thing but a few of her songs are pretty good. I could listen to her album under the right mood.
1099,2020-04-20 22:09:31,g52box,"It doesn‚Äôt seem like she sold her soul for fame, like lots of other people, which is good. Tons of fame and success because of two albums that she made at home with her brother. Well done."
1100,2020-04-20 22:05:11,g52box,"she looks chill, i like her style, and she sings well"
1101,2020-04-20 22:45:09,g52box,"Her music may not be my style, but I can respect her talent. I wish people would quit picking on her for stupid things."
1102,2020-04-20 22:22:08,g52box,i like her voice but i find it creepy that her brother writes songs for her with lyrics about her seducing dads and stuff. it just weirds me out.
1103,2020-04-20 22:04:02,g52box,One of the few popular artist nowadays who stands out and dgaf about the haters
1104,2020-04-20 22:10:26,g52box,"Gets a lot of unnecessary hate,  a lot from the metal elitists who comment on music vids saying Billie Eilish thinks she makes scary music videos but slayer, mushroomhead *insert metal band* is better. When billie has never bragged about making the scariest videos ever and the elitists just want to feel good because they like the scariest thing"
1105,2020-04-20 22:05:12,g52box,"She's pretty, and had a good voice.

Other than that, I'm not crazy about her. Although she does sing  very well"
1106,2020-04-20 22:02:50,g52box,she has talent. i'm curious to see which direction she'll go and what her music will be like in 10 or 20 years.
1107,2020-04-20 22:40:38,g52box,I have been a fan since her first album. I love her voice. That‚Äôs pretty much it.
1108,2020-04-20 22:04:55,g52box,I don't much like the whisper singing
1109,2020-04-20 22:58:07,g52box,She does care about her fans though. Ever seen the video of her giving water to a passed out fan.
1110,2020-04-20 22:36:22,g52box,"I like that she does what she seems to genuinely enjoy doing. She doesn‚Äôt seem to sell herself out to fit a more convenient or prosperous position at the expense of her natural style.

I‚Äôm super picky about music and only enjoy things song by song, and I liked two of her songs which is about average for most artists for me. So she gets my seal of approval."
1111,2020-04-20 23:30:12,g52box,She‚Äôs just Lorde #2.....now with edgy whisper singing
1112,2020-04-20 23:32:13,g52box,"She makes good music and i like her songs. The ""I'm 14 and this is deep"" meme was extremely exaggerated and she honestly doesn't deserve the hate. Some fans can be pretty annoying, but all things said i think she's fine. Not my favourite, by a long shot, but I'm also not one to shy away from her music"
1113,2020-04-21 01:01:06,g52box,"Never heard her music and disliked her based purely on what little I‚Äôd seen of her in media / memes. 
Listening to music with my wife tonight and she played ‚ÄòEverything I Wanted‚Äô and tbh it‚Äôs a beautiful song. I was shocked when she said it was her."
1114,2020-04-20 22:03:39,g52box,She's the bad guy.
1115,2020-04-20 22:32:26,g52box,don't know much about her but she seems like a nice person.
1116,2020-04-20 22:41:33,g52box,She is an artist right? Never heard her music. She looks very unhappy. Like extremely unhappy. Did see some comment she made about not wanting to conform to other people's expectations of her or something along the lines of that. Good. You should be yourself and yourself only.
1117,2020-04-20 23:00:00,g52box,nothing
1118,2020-04-20 23:00:49,g52box,"I liked her before people started framing her fans in a bad way.

Now I just secretly like her."
1119,2020-04-20 23:06:37,g52box,She's a talented singer who sounds the same live as she does in music videos.... only a handful of known singers can claim to do the same.
1120,2020-04-20 23:24:07,g52box,Overrated
1121,2020-04-20 23:28:13,g52box,Lovely
1122,2020-04-20 23:29:54,g52box,"I'm old so I look at her more from a lens of her being a teenager who seems to have a good head on her shoulders.

I don't relate to the music, but that's kinda to be expected given the thirty year gap in age and life experience. 

I've seen her do some acoustic versions of her songs and she's definitely got legit talent on the voice front."
1123,2020-04-20 23:47:53,g52box,She's a bad guy
1124,2020-04-21 01:22:21,g52box,"She isn‚Äôt a singer, she mumbles. 

Can we go back to when music was actually good?"
1125,2020-04-20 22:39:23,g52box,"She exists, I don't listen to her genre of music, so I don't really care about her or what she does. I don't hate her, it's just that I don't listen to her."
1126,2020-04-20 22:41:48,g52box,"Not really a fan of the music, she seems cool though. But seeing someone this young really makes me hope we won't treat her like Justin Bieber."
1127,2020-04-20 22:47:45,g52box,I‚Äôd love to see her take on different genres as her discography grows.
1128,2020-04-20 23:08:48,g52box,I really like her music. However it's very.. um.. sexual in nature. And a lot of it came out when she was underage so I feel like I can't like it cause that's creepy.
1129,2020-04-20 23:32:14,g52box,She knows quite a bit about The Office.
1130,2020-04-20 23:35:55,g52box,I like her voice but I'm not that into her music.
1131,2020-04-20 23:36:20,g52box,She‚Äôs a good singer and pretty but I personally don‚Äôt like the type of music she makes.
1132,2020-04-20 23:57:28,g52box,"She and her brother are like a modern day The Carpenters. Some really cool and interesting songwriting. I like her and think she will have a big career if she can stay hungry, not sell out, not get into substance abuse, and remain close with her brother."
1133,2020-04-21 00:54:44,g52box,"I used to be at best apathetic to her. Like, I didn‚Äôt hate her, but I‚Äôd never actively try to listen to her or be excited if someone put her on. Then I heard When The Party‚Äôs Over on the radio, and related so much it was almost creepy. Then I started listening to more of her, and found I related to a lot of her songs, including I Love You, Bored, Lovely, and 8"
1134,2020-04-21 00:57:25,g52box,"""Billie Eilish makes music for girls who call themselves psycho but are too afraid to ask for extra ketchup at a restaurant""."

Especially when remixed. Check out a mix with Mozart."
1137,2020-04-21 08:52:47,g52box,really love her.
1138,2020-04-22 18:14:54,g52box,I‚Äôll say it - I‚Äôm completely obsessed with her. I honestly thought I was getting ‚Äúbetter‚Äù and her hold on me was lessening and then I saw the video from her Instagram live the other night and holy damn. Sucked me right back in. Her talented ass self playing piano in the dark at 4am singing with her beautiful ass voice. It is annoying how talented she is.
1139,2020-04-20 22:10:15,g52box,"Billie's music is exciting and original as well as mature beyond her years; her look is freaky (**good** freaky, not bad freaky); music videos are captivating; her ethics are on point; she interviews well...my only gripe would be with her excessive use of the word ""*like*"" but that's because she's young and I'm a miserable, old bastard!"
1140,2020-04-20 22:00:41,g52box,I don't care for her music not my taste
1141,2020-04-20 22:01:30,g52box,I don‚Äôt
1142,2020-04-20 22:40:52,g52box,"Boring industry plant with the fakest aesthetic I've ever seen.

Also dumb and hypocritical"
1143,2020-04-20 22:47:36,g52box,I cannot stand her. She sounds like she's trying to imitate Lorde's lyrics with Lana Del Rey's voice. She's overhyped.
1144,2020-04-20 23:16:00,g52box,"I'm a fan, so I'm a little scared to scroll down."
1145,2020-04-20 23:52:26,g52box,waaaaaaaaaaay to much auto tune and monotone singing isn't talent. what happened to good music if someone finds out tell me.
1146,2020-04-20 22:15:46,g52box,Don't really like her music but she's got a great set of baps on her.
1147,2020-04-20 22:01:37,g52box,"Meh, honestly don‚Äôt care that much but if you‚Äôre fan that‚Äôs great"
1148,2020-04-20 22:12:43,g52box,"According to the comments, she's a singer :)  
Am I the only european who doesn't know her ?"
1149,2020-04-20 23:21:16,g52box,Who?
1150,2020-04-20 23:37:14,g52box,Overrated.
1151,2020-04-21 00:41:38,g52box,"Overrated because of her literally trashy ""depressive"" lyrics, people like to show off their fake ass depression, they're all crazy, why would anyone show off something like that?"
1152,2020-04-20 22:12:06,g52box,Phineas is the brains
1153,2020-04-20 22:47:42,g52box,I‚Äôm not into her music but I kinda think the radio screwed over her image a bit by overplaying ‚Äúbad guy‚Äù when she has arguably better songs which got little playtime.
1154,2020-04-20 22:50:33,g52box,I don't know him personally.
1155,2020-04-20 22:54:03,g52box,She's talented. Her music is not for me. It's not bad though. She gets a lot of hate that is unwarranted considering she is not bad at all and does not deserve it.
1156,2020-04-20 22:56:55,g52box,I've never been interested. I've also not been interested in a majority of modern music except for maybe a few.
1157,2020-04-20 22:57:00,g52box,"Not a fan of her music. I refer to her as ""that green-haired girl"""
1158,2020-04-20 23:01:41,g52box,I like her songs when they're redone into rock.
1159,2020-04-20 23:05:58,g52box,I love her she is super talented for her age.
1160,2020-04-20 23:05:59,g52box,"I like her music. I‚Äôm not sad, but I do relate sometimes. She‚Äôs also funny and does talk about some relatable off camera."
1161,2020-04-20 23:13:15,g52box,Idk how she summoned a dark house! Is she taking the souls?
1162,2020-04-20 23:14:03,g52box,"I really don‚Äôt want this to come across as bullying because she‚Äôs talented and pretty, but I noticed that one of her eyes is a lot higher than the other on her face, and now I can‚Äôt un-see it."
1163,2020-04-20 23:17:07,g52box,She‚Äôs not bad however I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôll be in the spotlight forevee
1164,2020-04-20 23:18:40,g52box,"I think she is talented and has a really beautiful voice, I‚Äôm just not a fan of her later works."
1165,2020-04-20 23:18:50,g52box,"She seems like she's her own person who doesn't take herself seriously, has some good songs, and gets way too much hate on Reddit."
1166,2020-04-20 23:23:16,g52box,"Don‚Äôt like her music, so I don‚Äôt listen to it.  Couldn‚Äôt care less about her otherwise."
1167,2020-04-20 23:23:44,g52box,Her ‚Äúdepressed ‚Äú fans gave her a bad image on reddit. Don‚Äôt know too much about her as a person but I like her music just fine.
1168,2020-04-20 23:23:54,g52box,I don't.
1169,2020-04-20 23:24:41,g52box,"Overrated, Ellie Ellish is better."
1170,2020-04-20 23:24:59,g52box,Just some random person people keep referencing for no apparent reason.
1171,2020-04-20 23:25:49,g52box,Who dat?
1172,2020-04-20 23:27:00,g52box,Rumour has it an Alien puked *Slime* on her scalp and it's permanent.
1173,2020-04-20 23:27:07,g52box,"I don't like her. And I'm not trying to be cool and edgy or anything, I just don't like her music."
1174,2020-04-20 23:27:19,g52box,Never heard of him.
1175,2020-04-20 23:30:09,g52box,I don‚Äôt
1176,2020-04-20 23:31:33,g52box,I think reddit wants to hate her because she's popular
1177,2020-04-20 23:32:25,g52box,I can't say I like her music very much but she is extremely popular and I have to respect her for being who she is despite the huge levels of pressure people get in the music industry to become generic pop stars.
1178,2020-04-20 23:33:22,g52box,Who?
1179,2020-04-20 23:34:13,g52box,not an artist i listen to much but a few of her songs are pretty good
1180,2020-04-20 23:34:25,g52box,"I don‚Äôt get the hype, tbh. She‚Äôs always sounded to me like store-brand Lorde."
1181,2020-04-20 23:34:37,g52box,"She‚Äôs not really my taste, but she‚Äôs obviously doing something right. Bonus points for coming to Sydney and sampling the sounds of our traffic lights for ‚ÄòBad Guy‚Äô"
1182,2020-04-20 23:35:40,g52box,\*eye roll\*
1183,2020-04-20 23:43:44,g52box,Why do you care?
1184,2020-04-21 00:03:22,g52box,I'd enjoy tripping with her I think lol.
1185,2020-04-21 00:33:22,g52box,"as a person? she's pretty average for an 18 year old ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø 

as a singer? well, I'm not really a big fan of her. I don't exactly dislike her per say, it's more of a case that i don't really care enough to listen to any of her songs, like i do with 99% of singers.

probably because i like to listen to music more than I do songs."
1186,2020-04-21 00:34:38,g52box,I think her music is ok it‚Äôs just not my type but her fanbase is so annoying people automatically think her music is bad.
1187,2020-04-21 00:35:58,g52box,"I don't.  She's a singer, right?"
1188,2020-04-21 00:52:44,g52box,Someday I would like to see her with her eyes completely open.  It's odd to see eyes that have no reflected light in them ever.
1189,2020-04-21 01:04:04,g52box,i dont
1190,2020-04-21 01:08:22,g52box,I barely know who she is. Should I know who she is?
1191,2020-04-21 01:13:01,g52box,"Don't know much about her, don't like her music, and she gives me weird vibes"
1192,2020-04-21 01:22:46,g52box,"Just don‚Äôt understand why she‚Äôs popular. Run on the mill, boilerplate, emo teen music. Not even that attractive. Super don‚Äôt get it. 

Also her hair looks effin gross."
1193,2020-04-21 01:36:43,g52box,Looks like lil xan after the surgery!
1194,2020-04-21 01:41:06,g52box,Her fans are as annoying as k pop fans and her whole look at me I‚Äôm quirky pisses me of but other then that she has done very well for herself so good for her I guess
1195,2020-04-21 01:42:01,g52box,"Uh, she's cool, I guess. I don't go out of my way to listen to her but her stuff's not bad"
1196,2020-04-21 01:45:58,g52box,"I'm not a fan of her, but some of her songs are good."
1197,2020-04-21 01:53:47,g52box,She‚Äôs carved out a very successful niche in ASMR hip hop
1198,2020-04-21 05:46:05,g52box,"Um, who the hell is that?"
1199,2020-04-21 21:20:26,g52box,"Don't know her music, heard it's good. Don't care for her choice of clothing, but whatever it doesn't effect me."
1200,2020-04-21 00:56:00,g52box,Not for me and her fan base is annoying
1201,2020-04-21 00:10:02,g52box,"This is going to seem harsh, but I find her hard on the eyes"
1202,2020-04-20 23:41:47,g52box,He always looks so sleepy
1203,2020-04-21 01:10:35,g52box,I think she's got a fantastic pair of big dirty milkers. Also I think she makes music or something.
1204,2020-04-20 23:24:08,g52box,Same
1205,2020-04-20 23:55:24,g52box,Ehhh her parents are in show biz iirc
1206,2020-04-21 00:13:35,g52box,If you're talking about 'bad guy' the song was written as a satire about ppl who think they're hardcore shit but obviously aren't cuz they feel the need to say dumb shit like *insert lyrics*
1207,2020-04-20 22:48:21,g52box,"Yeah, this is so creepy."
1208,2020-04-20 23:08:37,g52box,"The lyric is meant to be ‚Äúyeah, I do bad stuff like seduce your dad‚Äù... as in, that‚Äôs fucking gross."
1209,2020-04-20 23:54:41,g52box,"Teens dgaf about much, it‚Äôll change"
1210,2020-04-20 23:35:33,g52box,"I dunno, while I'm out of touch on most things, I got my finger on the pulse of the metal community, have for many years. I've never seen anyone try to compare Billie to metal in any way shape or form. It's just super random and nothing I've ever heard. And for the comparisons.. Slayer? Mushroomhead actually kinda makes a little sense. Even if no one's talked about them since 2014 they have a strong, creepy visual style that they always work into their videos. Say what you want about the band, their videos are really cool.

I'd be interested to see where metal elitists are getting butthurt about Billie Eilish, they usually just fight amongst themselves, she's an odd target if it's true."
1211,2020-04-20 23:10:54,g52box,"It's like if people suggested [Jakalope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Nk4b3hIoEo) meant to be hardcore metal. 

Don't worry guys, that was never the intent."
1212,2020-04-20 22:20:04,g52box,Talent?
1213,2020-04-20 22:55:44,g52box,She doesn't whisper sing most of the time.
1214,2020-04-20 22:06:03,g52box,"If you listen to ""no time to die"" by Billie that song is not a whisper song"
1215,2020-04-21 01:13:48,g52box,Doesn't even sound similar tho. Unless you're a moron who doesn't know anything about music.
1216,2020-04-21 03:33:32,g52box,"Totally. Based on the hype I was quite disinterested, but now that I‚Äôve actually heard some of her songs, I like her."
1217,2020-04-20 22:31:27,g52box,Duh.
1218,2020-04-20 23:52:18,g52box,Yeah I would advise you not to look at the rest
1219,2020-04-22 18:05:41,g52box,"She doesn‚Äôt use autotune, and her singing is far from monotone. So you‚Äôve heard bad guy and...that‚Äôs it huh?"
1220,2020-04-21 08:43:05,g52box,<insert ‚ÄúHow could you say something so controversial yet so brave?‚Äù meme>
1221,2020-04-20 22:13:20,g52box,You should listen to her!
1222,2020-04-21 01:12:09,g52box,If that's the case why does his solo music suck?
1223,2020-04-21 00:07:11,g52box,"Or blowing someone right, unfortunately"
1224,2020-04-21 15:28:52,g52box,"I didn‚Äôt know that. It might‚Äôve had an effect on her success, then."
1225,2020-04-21 00:31:47,g52box,"i read a little bit about it after i first heard it and i get that its supposed to be tongue in cheek, but to the average person listening to it, they might not get it right away and i‚Äôve seen people not get it on twitter and stuff not get it. i think lots of it has to do with her age. i keep bringing it up but, i think had she been older when it was released, it would have worked well because i think the whole thing being released while she was still a minor kind of creeped people out and threw them off a bit."
1226,2020-04-20 23:30:12,g52box,it would be just as creepy if it was a random songwriter thats been hired to write it but i find it even more creepy that its her BROTHER that wrote that for her. its just yikes and gross
1227,2020-04-21 06:40:51,g52box,"I‚Äôm talking like random comments for people to get recognition
Look at comments on mushroomheads we are the truth video or slayers repentless on YouTube ( I think it‚Äôs those)
Some of the elitists just seem scared that she is 
Making mainstream creepy videos because ‚Äúthat‚Äôs what metal artists do‚Äù. Annoys me a bit. It‚Äôs not all of them just a few but it is still frustrating to see
Some of it is said as a joke but some
Seem to take t personally for some reason"
1228,2020-04-20 22:22:50,g52box,"i don't really like her music, but i've listened to her album a few times and it's better than most pop music. let's say songwriting talent for someone her age, maybe.

edit: i just put on her album again. she has a distinctive voice that's not bad at all. she's promising. i'd say she could go on to do great things. or she could stick to making tons of money doing pop music."
1229,2020-04-20 22:54:36,g52box,She can sing. If you don't think she can then you're just an assshole who doesn't know shit.
1230,2020-04-20 23:15:05,g52box,Shows how much I know about Eilish
1231,2020-04-21 01:23:20,g52box,"Which are there, because I asked this question. But actually I'm looking for other fans and not anything negative about my idol."
1232,2020-04-22 18:26:04,g52box,every music artist uses autotune and I have listened to a few of here songs I worded that wrong monotone wasn't the word I should have used but I don't know how to explain her voice she makes me wanna through up artist pre2016 were actually good now were stuck with mumble rap and emo pop what happened to good music
1233,2020-04-20 22:19:07,g52box,Will do !
1234,2020-04-21 01:14:43,g52box,"Hmmmm... cuz a brain without a voice sucks ?
Idk... what do you think ?"
1235,2020-04-22 18:11:19,g52box,"Just fwiw her parents were voice actors and extras, never made a ton or got a lot of recognition or clout in the industry. I think the biggest way they helped Billie and Finneas was just allowing them to pursue their creative interests while being as supportive as could be."
1236,2020-04-20 23:34:28,g52box,"Well I see it more as it being her way of expressing herself and he helps her get her point across, they have a really strong relationship and I think it's a beautiful thing that they can be such a good combination but yeah i get your point"
1237,2020-04-20 23:13:36,g52box,"She doesn't just have talent.  I am not sure why I like her songwriting, but I do."
1238,2020-04-21 02:02:56,g52box,I love billie Eilish but some people are saying not so nice things about her
1239,2020-04-22 18:27:04,g52box,I think you mean her voice makes you want to ‚Äúthrow up‚Äù and if you‚Äôre having that reaction to sound you should see a dr you may have an inner ear problem.
1240,2020-04-22 18:34:06,g52box,"In all seriousness, i know her singing style isn‚Äôt what most people are used to, but the control she has is insane. Combined with the fact that all of her music is made by her and her brother in his bedroom, and they‚Äôve done so well with it, it‚Äôs all pretty amazing. And she plays instruments, writes/cowrites her lyrics, does a lot of her own work for visuals and merch designs, and even directs/co directs her music vids. She‚Äôs a brilliant kid. 
I think it takes a bit to get accustomed to her sound, at first some of her songs to me sounded weird and not necessarily good even, but after I let them process and I listened again and watched a few vids where she explained  some of the songs meanings/how they‚Äôre created, I now appreciate and love every single one. The various techniques and layers and overall atmosphere that makes each song like it‚Äôs own standalone universe is so so interesting.     
But, to each their own."
1241,2020-04-21 01:19:01,g52box,But he can sing. His songs are just mediocre pop.
1242,2020-04-20 23:50:15,g52box,i agree that its great her and her brother have a great relationship and they are both really talented and work well together. they are obviously really talented! and i totally see it as a way for her to express herself and i would never take that away from her. but the lyrics ‚Äúmight seduce your dad type‚Äù coming out of the mouth of a 17 yo just doesn‚Äôt sit right with me.
1243,2020-04-23 22:10:10,g52box,So what does this have to do with you? Does this interfere with you being able to enjoy her music?
1244,2020-04-22 18:57:11,g52box,sorry but I can't reduce myself to being a sinner be gone hellspawn
1245,2020-04-21 01:22:58,g52box,"Very interesting. I've honestly never listened.
I like her a bunch. But the story I watched made it seem  like he was a crucial piece to the puzzle...  I think it's really cool that shes SO cool for being SO young.."
1246,2020-04-20 23:52:02,g52box,I mean yeah definitely but that's just her expressing herself I definitely get you though
1247,2020-04-22 19:00:10,g52box,"Oh what a well written, intelligent response. Lovely. Your parents must be thrilled."
1248,2020-04-22 19:03:03,g52box,I'm just fucking with you I just can't bring myself to like billie elish no matter how hard I try I was just giving my honest opinion and I think her brother is a good singer

When we do go on air, put your wallets away, your credit cards away, and ENJOY THE SHOW,"" she explained during an at-home live stream.""
It also seems like the number '6' is very popular with this pandemic‚Ä¶.
üî∏Keep '6 feet' away, social distancing
üî∏¬†Netflix Pandemic documentary has '6 Episodes'
üî∏According to the WHO definition, 'Phase 6' is a pandemic¬†üî∏CDC unveils '6-phase' pandemic response blueprint
üî∏The word Corona has '6 letter', simple gematria equals '66'
üî∏Headline from AP news‚Ä¶""China didn‚Äôt warn public of likely pandemic for '6 key days'.
üî∏Headline from NPR org ""WHO Sets '6 Conditions' For Ending A Coronavirus Lockdown""
üî∏And now we have this '6 hour' ritual, not 3 hours or 4 hours but '6' long hours!
üëâRemember what took place in Daniel 3, King Nebuchadnezzar made a statue for the people to bow down to that was '6' cubits high and '6' cubits wide. BUT before they bowed down, what happened first‚Ä¶..¬†üéºThe MUSIC had to be played! Remember this is all spiritual.¬†‚öîÔ∏è
üìñ¬†""Then the herald loudly proclaimed, ‚ÄúO PEOPLE of EVERY NATION and LANGUAGE this is what you are COMMANDED: As soon as you HEAR the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes, and all kinds of MUSIC,üé∫¬†you must fall down and WORSHIP the golden statue that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up.""
I'll leave Daniel 3 in the comments for easy reference. There is nothing new under the sun.üå§
Music is powerful, and satan has been using it since the beginning of time to influence people. ""Studies have shown that different languages, tempos, tones, and sound levels of music can cause different effects on emotions, mental activities, and physical reactions."" We know this is true because people are paid well to put music to commercials and movies. And we know subliminal messages are often hidden in music.
These worldly artist (idols or stars) worship the god of this world. Don't be fooled, this is not about supporting our 'Healthcare Workers'. This is a World-Wide Satanic Ritual that is coming this Saturday. Getting you ready to accept this New World Order‚Ä¶.
Keep watch!"

1301,2020-05-03 12:37:24,gcpuiy,Fact
1302,2020-05-03 12:40:25,gcpuiy,And why is that?
1303,2020-05-03 12:53:08,gcpuiy,Obviously the internet should persuade you not to be a Nazi or racist or scumbag but my post just speaks about normal people with normal preferences.
1304,2020-05-03 12:57:07,gcpuiy,What's so wrong with furries?
1305,2020-05-03 12:41:21,gcpuiy,Bruh ur joking
1306,2020-05-03 13:00:10,gcpuiy,"The fandom has been built up on Sexualizing anthropomorphic animals, which isnt too bad. But with the fandom growing more and more are using the platform of it to express their depraved desires and actions and there are 100s maybe even 1000s or cases of furry doing unspeakable acts against animals."
1307,2020-05-03 12:42:05,gcpuiy,So are you gonna give your reasoning?
1308,2020-05-03 13:02:29,gcpuiy,"Let's take anime as an example for this. There are people out there who like Loli porn (basically drawn child porn) yet anime has a good reputation? It does not make sense, basically what you're saying is that a group of minorities who like beastiality represent the whole fandom? In that example it's like saying anime is a sexual preference for child pornography, which it is obviously not."
1309,2020-05-03 12:43:48,gcpuiy,Isn't it obvious?
1310,2020-05-03 13:05:54,gcpuiy,"Yes, many weebs like loli porn but most weebs arent going around fucking children. Furries on the other hand have on many circumstances fucked animals, sometimes ro death. Furthermore, anime doesn't facilitate the depravity of its fandom as much as the furry community does. I can completely ignore lolicons because no one respects them and they aren't an ingrained part of the group. Furries, on the other hand, have zoophiles everywhere and they are inescapable in the fandom."
1311,2020-05-03 12:45:04,gcpuiy,It's not.
1312,2020-05-03 13:10:36,gcpuiy,"You should see the furry community as a fruit market. Now there are bad and ugly apples, and there are apples that are good. But you on the other hand only complain about the bad and ugly apples, making the fruit market seem like a bad place to go because the presence of bad and ugly apples is common."
1313,2020-05-03 12:45:26,gcpuiy,Bruh
1314,2020-05-03 13:12:23,gcpuiy,"I agree. The furry community shouldnt be bamned or anything and there are fine members, even some of my idols were artists for funny animals. But there are a lot of bad apples. Like half of the fruit market has been sprayed in Agent Orange"
1315,2020-05-03 12:55:31,gcpuiy,"So you're saying furries should be put under peer pressure by the internet and they should all quit their hobby, yet you can't give a reason for it? Now that's 'bruh'."
1316,2020-05-03 13:15:00,gcpuiy,Only 15% of furries Are sexualized.
1317,2020-05-03 13:15:54,gcpuiy,"I have to agree that there is a large increase in beastiality, and bad apples, that's the reason I'm not a furry anymore, yet it does have some good things that it should also be presented for."
1318,2020-05-03 12:56:22,gcpuiy,So you're not understanding whats so wrong about being a furry. Now thats a bruh
1319,2020-05-03 13:25:58,gcpuiy,Citations?
1320,2020-05-03 13:10:25,gcpuiy,"Not every furry is sexualized. You realize that, right? You do also realize that most furries aren‚Äôt trying to hurt or harm anybody. It‚Äôs what they like to do, and nobody should bash them for their hobby. 


You just don‚Äôt understand so you turn to making fun of it. But not every single furry is a sexualized one. I recommend watching Anthony Padilla‚Äôs ‚ÄúI spent a day with Furries‚Äù. It‚Äôs very informative and maybe you‚Äôll learn they‚Äôre not so bad after all.

(15% of furries are sexualized. That‚Äôs not even 1/5. Check your other resources, because that‚Äôs wrong. I got this number from a primary source.)"
1321,2020-05-03 12:59:20,gcpuiy,Yet you're not giving any reason for me to understand what's so wrong about it. I've asked you twice now what's your reasoning to hate on furries.
1322,2020-05-03 13:26:58,gcpuiy,"Check out Anthony Padilla‚Äôs video. It‚Äôs from a primary source.

Also, people only talked about the sexualized ones. They never talk about furries who aren‚Äôt sexualized and are just trying to express themselves."
1323,2020-05-03 13:12:00,gcpuiy,"Nah fam. Anthony Padilla also has a video with people who have a baby and a parent dynamic in a relationship, does that make it any less disgusting? No"
1324,2020-05-03 13:02:17,gcpuiy,https://www.debate.org/opinions/should-furries-be-genocided
1325,2020-05-03 13:32:06,gcpuiy,"I did talk about them. The argument is over and youre late to the party. There are plenty of fine furries but the bad ones are more vocal and seem to be more numerous than the good. Also, this video isnt your primary source, youre just rewording the shit in the video, which has no citations to a viable statistic, so you can take that number and shove it up your ass. Thank you"
1326,2020-05-03 13:14:05,gcpuiy,"Yes, but furries aren‚Äôt disgusting. You‚Äôre not even giving them a chance. You won‚Äôt even watch the video because you‚Äôre so goddamn stubborn. Also, your other resources are wrong. Most furries aren‚Äôt sexualized and purely dress as animals. The only thing people talk about is the ones who do sexualize it. However, that is actually the minority. 

I literally told you not even 1/5 of furries are into sexual furries. So you‚Äôre going to immediately hate every single one?"
1327,2020-05-03 13:06:29,gcpuiy,There isn't any constructive proof that the furry community is 100% sexual. You rely purely on other people's discussions without having proof or knowledge about the furry community itself. Should all humans be hated and killed for others acts like murder or rape?
1328,2020-05-03 13:36:07,gcpuiy,"You do realize that came straight from a furry. Somebody who‚Äôs likely to know most about the community, someone who‚Äôs very involved. 

Yiffing can refer to anything from affectionate hugging or nuzzling to totally going at it,"" says Strike. ""It's definitely part of the fandom but it's not what the fandom is all about. If I had to throw a percentage on it I would say maybe 15%, give or take.""

That‚Äôs from a CNN article, which interviewed the founder of some conventions, I believe. You can double check me on that, if you‚Äôd like: https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2018/11/14/us/furries-culture/index.html"

1330,2020-05-03 13:08:34,gcpuiy,"Dude im real tired, now listen. Being a furry is a perversion and should not be accepted. Bullying furries is the way to go."
1331,2020-05-03 13:39:36,gcpuiy,"Thats still anecdotal, id only believe it if there was a survey. And if you wanna throw links at me, go to the Fredrik Knudsen video about furries, where its made apparent that furry culture is built on sexualizing anthro animals. Also the yiff thing is complete bs. Even if what you said is true, thats not how its used. The definition of Cheese Pizza is a pizza with no toppings but do you really think pedophiles are just ordering a bunch of plain pizza bro?"
1332,2020-05-03 13:15:31,gcpuiy,Well then you‚Äôre just as disgusting as you consider furries.
1333,2020-05-03 13:12:10,gcpuiy,You should think about what I said next time you post something as nonsensical as this. Have a good day.
1334,2020-05-03 13:40:32,gcpuiy,That came from the president of the community itself? I don‚Äôt know what else to tell you dude.
1335,2020-05-03 13:15:46,gcpuiy,Nah
1336,2020-05-03 13:12:33,gcpuiy,No i wont because i still dtand behind my point
1337,2020-05-03 13:43:59,gcpuiy,"That doesnt matter. He may be the president, but that doesnt mean hes a total expert. The leader of the FBI, even though theyre the leader of the most powerful level of law enforcement, probably couldn't tell you a completely accurate number of how much crime goes on. And the FBI leader has statistics, and advisors. The furry President has neither statistics nor advisors given they cant know everything going on in the fandom."
1338,2020-05-03 13:17:02,gcpuiy,"Yes, you are a disgusting human. You‚Äôre antagonizing others because they‚Äôre different than you. You feel good about that? That‚Äôs disgusting. You don‚Äôt even consider that maybe what you‚Äôre saying could be hurtful, and you wont even try to learn about the community before bashing it.

That‚Äôs fucking disgusting. I‚Äôd take a furry any day over someone like you."
1339,2020-05-03 13:44:26,gcpuiy,Okay.
1340,2020-05-03 13:18:19,gcpuiy,Lol okay

1342,2020-05-03 13:19:41,gcpuiy,"I mean it‚Äôs true. You‚Äôre just saying ‚Äúlol okay‚Äù because you think that I‚Äôm wrong, when you won‚Äôt even open your mind to learning about something you‚Äôre clearly unfamiliar with lmao"
1343,2020-05-03 13:20:42,gcpuiy,I won't because i think its disgusting
1344,2020-05-03 13:22:09,gcpuiy,"No, that‚Äôs what you‚Äôve seen. That‚Äôs what people talk about. Not the ones who aren‚Äôt disgusting. Only 15% fucking percent of furries are sexualized. Most furries aren‚Äôt. Yet, you hate a whole group of people for just a few bad apples. That‚Äôs like saying you hate all old people because of a few boomers.

You‚Äôre judging people you don‚Äôt even know about. And I think *that* is disgusting."
1345,2020-05-03 13:23:26,gcpuiy,I said i dont like the concept of furries. Also saying the word boomer like its relevant lol
1346,2020-05-03 13:25:07,gcpuiy,"You don‚Äôt like the concept? Okay? That doesn‚Äôt mean you should hate those people for liking something. That‚Äôs just like the people who hate kids who play Fortnite. They hate the game, so they also hate the kids. That‚Äôs fucking stupid, you dumb fuck.

Also that‚Äôs irrelevant lol"
1347,2020-05-03 13:30:21,gcpuiy,"Dude ur fr too invested, chill. I don't hate the ppl.but i think they should be discouraged by society. And 15% is not that small of a percentage..."
1348,2020-05-03 13:32:55,gcpuiy,"Okay, but your other source said 100%, right? And you at first thought 100%. 15% is a rather small number compared to the community. That‚Äôs not even 1/5. So when you say they‚Äôre disgusting, you‚Äôre talking about the minority of furries.

And yes I‚Äôm invested. Some of my friends are furries and the fact that someone is bashing them is horrible. They‚Äôre just trying to express themselves, yet people like you won‚Äôt even give them a chance.

Why should it be discouraged if most people in the community are completely fine? Is it just because YOU don‚Äôt like it?"
1349,2020-05-03 13:35:03,gcpuiy,Lol nah i didn't. And also they're hated by a lot of ppl so like
1350,2020-05-03 13:37:19,gcpuiy,"Then why‚Äôd you include that source if it‚Äôs wrong?

And just because a ton of people think one way doesn‚Äôt make it right."
1351,2020-05-03 13:38:05,gcpuiy,It literally shows different arguments but ight
1352,2020-05-03 13:38:33,gcpuiy,"Okay, but just because a lot of people don‚Äôt like it, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs wrong."
1353,2020-05-03 13:40:17,gcpuiy,You suggested they shouldn't stop just because i think its wrong so you're tye only one who said it'll be justified if a lot kf ppl belive it

But I just do not understand the hate. I don't care for her music as such but its a far cry from the downright *annoying* shit that many other artists of whatever gender produce. If her music were the most asinine lyrically and most repetitive musically pop music got, then the world would be a much better place. But sadly, it is not."

1495,2020-05-03 00:50:08,gcd5n7,"It very well could've as it's not as polarizing an album. 100 gecs has people who love it passionately who will vote it through when it needs the majority positive votes, and also a group who can not stand the album.

As much as I want Seattle to have a team again, having Bezos bring a team back to Seattle does not get him off the hook for his predatory practices towards his workers, and shame on anyone to suggest otherwise.

Also it's laughable to name the area ""Climate Pledge Arena"" and enact some green initiatives to the area, despite the fact that Amazon  as a company is one of the largest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions due to transporting their goods.

The issue with your comment, however, is that Amazon is planning to become carbon free by 2040, 10 years before the Paris Agreement's set date. They can't be carbon free now because there isn't enough renewable electricity generation or zero carbon emission transportation method to make the company totally green. For what it's worth, Amazon's headquarters are LEED certified as are their future office developments in Washington D.C. region. This is something they could do immediately and they have done so. There aren't enough electric trucks out their for Amazon deliveries to be totally carbon free. Amazon warehouses are powered by power generation companies they have no control over. Acting like Amazon is some horrendous violator of the enivorment because they can't be totally carbon free at the moment is silly.

The one thing they did appreciate was having the seat for ride along passengers at games, which is possible for electric zams because the seat goes where the propane tanks normally do. 

That being said, the rainwater concept seems really interesting. As long as the collected water is as thoroughly processed as tap water it should be fine. Anything less and youre risking discoloration and surface cohesion problems. Any kind of too oily or too cohesive substance will totally fuck up the surface layer of the ice, even in really small quantities. When we were epoxying a floor at the top of our stands, some of it evaporated into the air and migrated to the ice sheet. It took over a month of every day resurfacing to remove it, so if youre talking about ice that only gets resurfaced on game days then it needs to be perfect from the moment you lay it down.

In fact, its almost certain that their delivery system is far more efficient than older systems, and has probably led to an overall reduction in greenhouse gas emissions required to get a good from factory to consumer. Home delivery is a far more efficient means of distribution than having everyone drive around to different stores to collect the things they need."

You have to compare comparable companies and determine if they are trying to reduce emissions. An airline is inherently going to produce more emissions than a company in another industry. Does that mean that airline is more evil if they are actively working on ways to reduce emissions when the other company is not? No. 
 
At least amazon has a net zero pledge for 2040 which is 100x better than most other companies. And why do people act like the responsibility should be with companies and not the government? Specific companies should be put at a disadvantage competitively to do right by our environment while other companies opt to do nothing.

Eventually the philanthropist dies and they get a museum named after them and everyone forgets about the bad shit they did.

Other than the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which btw hasn't named any sports stadiums something like ""ending malaria forever arena"", I can't think of a truly successful campaign like this that has amounted in anything other than shifting public perception to shape up the donor's image.

The fact of the matter is that real change, especially when it comes to the coming climate failure, will require a complete rearrangement of individual values, corporate ethics and morality, and will cost hundreds of trillions of dollars. If Jeff actually cared about our future, the climate, any of that shit, he could build those changes into Amazon himself, now. Instead he panders with this BS. It's greenwashing, a grand marketing scheme meant to convince people to keep consuming, that Amazon is a good company, when they are actually looting their customers and Jeff is laughing all the way to the bank."

Also his pledge money goes through his foundation (hello write-off) and is directed into companies he has some investment in already. A true Green New Deal funded by taxpayers would be public and not make directly private companies even richer.

2115,2020-06-26 05:24:52,hfxt8u,"For me it's not that he needs to do *more*, it's that he continues to be responsible for so many ongoing, unrelated negative things that this seems more like an obvious distraction ploy."
2116,2020-06-26 15:35:32,hfxt8u,"Yeah, the irony isnt lost on me lol... just think lots of small gestures (that could obv be larger) can do a lot of good not only cumulatively, but in the way of changing public perception around climate change, setting precedents, etc.  There are intangible benefits to small scale actions that shouldnt be ignored.  Bezos could definitely do more, but hes chosen space as his focus.  The larger problem is we have a societal structure where one person has that amount of power and influence.  It shouldnt be up to one person (or ppl in general, this is rly a govt issue) to decide whether or not we make progress on climate change."

2122,2020-06-26 06:17:22,hfxt8u,the issue isn‚Äôt so much door to door delivery (altho that‚Äôs not ideal) but the rapid delivery. flying something across the country is ~100x more carbon emissions than by diesel train and ~140x more than by cargo ship ([source](https://www.airportwatch.org.uk/air-freight/carbon-emissions-of-air-freight-compared-to-other-modes-of-transport/)). amazon has normalized consumers expecting goods in 2 days which is simply not possible without flying

His company literally changed millions of peoples buying habits from a store which gets it's supplies in bulk to individually packaged items shipped to your home. It's obvious that this cultural change causes a huge increase in emissions. Also the low shipping times require a lot of extra movement between warehouses, meaning the whole company has business models that are worse for the environment than the ones that they replaced."

2132,2020-06-26 03:27:10,hfxt8u,"No this is an awesome question

I tend to count those press releases as bullshit unless proven otherwise

Often times though it may be to a long list of organizations and it wouldn‚Äôt make sense to put it all in a article title

I believe the Nike Jordan converse 100 mil donation had a short original list towards which the first 10 mil was planned to go

To be fair if I were donating a lot of money I‚Äôd really have to believe in one organization to put all 10 mil there so giving them the benefit of the doubt I‚Äôd imagine most people split up their donations to lots of sources"

It‚Äôs worth doing the research to find organizations actually making a difference.
2134,2020-06-26 03:21:43,hfxt8u,"Nah man it‚Äôs a great question. Where does it go? One of the biggest scams ever is the Susan g koman foundation, and I bet the majority of ‚Äúdonations‚Äù head over to foundations like that. 

Edit: perfect example: we‚Äôve been donating to cancer foundations for decades now, and the best we can do is some nine month therapy that Essentially kills yourself?

exit: you guys are focusing more on the disease cancer itself, what about all the money that has been donated to fund..."

2139,2020-06-26 03:28:14,hfxt8u,"90% of the time they own the charity themselves, which means that the money goes back to them and they get to use that same money as a tax write-off while also getting a nice PR boost. That's why yall shouldn't fall for bullshit like Bill Gates saying he's going to donate the entirety of his wealth to charity when really it's going to be cycled within their Bill and Melinda Gates foundation that only furthers their interests (government-funded charter schools for the rich, etc.)"

Like everybody complains Amazon is paying zero federal taxes, when it's because they spend as much as they can on capital expenditures, exactly what you want a company to do (spend it instead of just hoarding or distributing to shareholders through buybacks/dividends).

Meanwhile giant oil corps have been profitable for decades and still get huge tax breaks (and even more thanks to Trump's tax overhaul a couple years ago)."
2143,2020-06-26 02:03:53,hfxt8u,"Is there anything specific that Amazon does that makes it worse than similar companies or is it just that it is large and does lots of the same shit that every other company does in the same field? If I had to think of one thing that you could blame them for, it would be consumer shopping patterns."
2144,2020-06-26 01:20:00,hfxt8u,"Yeah, one environmentally-friendly arena is nice, but it's not much compared to what he could do with his real business. Even donating 0.01% of Amazon profits to climate charities would have a bigger impact"

But they're aiming for carbon neutrality by 2040 - far as I know we don't have 20 years but more like 10-12. At some point we (collectively) now need to look beyond bottom-line friendly long term plans. Slow and steady may very well lose this race.

For instance, is their competition for online grocery sales just other online grocery sales?  Or should we compare it to in-store grocery sales and their supply chains/logistics, then tax the difference in carbon footprint for delivery?  

Or one step further, both of those types of grocery be compared to a local farmers market and CSA program, which has even less footprint and more local sourcing.

What's the fair system to set up?  How much do we want the system to pressure consumers toward minimizing footprint vs. indulging absolute convenience?"

Exactly how the funds will be distributed remains to be seen, but Bezos claims money will start flowing this summer in the form of grants to scientists, activists and nonprofit groups for ""any effort that offers a real possibility to help preserve and protect the natural world.""

Part of the reason they don't give specific answers is because it's a grant program. So it's not sketchy to not name it now, they actually don't know who they are giving to yet. 

The important part is that people follow-up and track where that funding is going, because it's fair not to trust someone like Bezos."

The millions of minimum wage Amazon workers that aren't even allowed to unionize and barely make enough to live by and have little labour protections or insurance will be the ones that will be left to struggle and starve if Amazon goes bankrupt .

Being out of shape or old really isn't a good thing for any physical labor job no matter what the conditions are. Every facility is different though, individual managers are what really matter.

2538,2020-06-26 12:55:13,hfxt8u,"I feel like he does deserve the 11% of his company that he hasn't sold off. If other people value 11% of Amazon as billions of dollars, so be it."
2539,2020-06-26 07:27:34,hfxt8u,"Yeah but what do you do at that point. There isnt a way to effectively take his wealth without the government. And its the government, you think they'll redistribute that money or buy another round of fighter jets or whatever they got in the military"
2540,2020-06-26 13:35:39,hfxt8u,"Ha!! Good one! So clever!

Jeff Bezos is an asshole. I never said he wasn't. But people who criticize every donation or get upset every time an asshole does something good are also assholes, albeit to a much lesser degree."
2541,2020-06-26 07:09:21,hfxt8u,"He‚Äôs one of the most powerful individuals in the world, he can handle redditors criticizing him buddy.


Amazon workers are also peeing in bottles because they aren‚Äôt given enough time to use the restroom on their shifts, so let‚Äôs not act like his wealth has been gained completely ethically. Humanizing him takes away from the lives he‚Äôs actively ruining in the pursuit of wealth. He‚Äôs an evil man who doesn‚Äôt give two shits about any of us, it‚Äôll take more than buying an arena to change that."
2542,2020-06-26 05:19:50,hfxt8u,Which is why people are upset.
2543,2020-06-26 07:13:43,hfxt8u,Which is why amazon should pay taxes

2545,2020-06-26 05:02:39,hfxt8u,"Man Jeff Bezos is absolutely horrible to his workers, I‚Äôm not sure how people justify that shit."
2546,2020-06-26 03:36:42,hfxt8u,"whether the info is right or not, fuck Bezos lol. even if this ends up being a point in his favor, he's still got about a dozen more things he needs to answer for and correct as the world's richest man. money is zero sum and you don't get that rich without stepping on a ton of other people's toes. that much wealth is inherently immoral"
2547,2020-06-26 10:56:11,hfxt8u,The only one spreading bad info is you when you throw out dumb shit like how much he has donated while completely ignoring how much he is actually worth. Bezos donated the equivalent of pocket change and suckers like you fellate him for it.
2548,2020-06-26 04:49:00,hfxt8u,"I get what you're saying, I think in Bezos' case it's more and argument of, ""you became a billionaire by exploiting your workers, evading taxes and manipulating local governments to bend to your will, donating a few million doesn't really make up for it."" Which I think is pretty resonable."

When you‚Äôre making massive profits, it opens you up to competition, because someone can come in to undercut you and do the same thing at a lower profit. But when you‚Äôre just focused on growth, you can become impossible to compete with."
2557,2020-06-26 13:01:10,hfxt8u,You have no idea what you're talking about.

2560,2020-06-26 02:40:40,hfxt8u,"amazon has pledged to become carbon neutral

Amazon launched a $2 billion fund today to advance technologies that will cut down greenhouse gases. The fund will help Amazon and other companies adhere to The Climate Pledge initiative it started in September 2019. That pledge committed the company, and others that sign onto it, to becoming carbon neutral by 2040.

so looks like he has put in effort to reach goals. is that fast enough? who knows.

Still better than denial we get from world leaders.


Amazon also announced today that by 2025, it will rely on renewable energy for all its energy use. That‚Äôs five years earlier than a goal it previously set for itself."
2561,2020-06-26 18:32:03,hfxt8u,"That isn‚Äôt how the industry works. Food/weight, yes, but not for other centers or sleeping."
2562,2020-06-26 23:16:50,hfxt8u,"Your statement on reusable packaging is an assumption on both sides that I'm not sure you can make so confidently. It is at that point also more about ecology than about climate change. 

And again. Except for the final journey (akin to the consumer driving their car to the store), mail is *also* shipped in bulk. In fact. That final journey (which adds the largest proportion of carbon content per kg of goods) is still shipped somewhat in bulk (hundreds) for home delivered parcels, whereas it is not for the physical store goods (consumer drives at most a high single digit number of goods together in their own car)

Your final argument on overconsumption is a fair one, but also somewhat of a side step of the discussion that you can never really believably make anyways. Because how did you type this reddit response? On a phone you didn't really need to hold right now (else you'd not be on reddit), using internet you didn't really need right now (else you'd not be on reddit)? Of course to any sane person that sounds ridiculous, imean, of course having a phone and doing menial free time stuff on it is okay. But why do you then staunchly draw that arbitrary line at ""online massive warehouse stores"" as being not acceptable in terms of overconsumption vis-a-vis brick and mortar stores still being acceptable? In the end, there is a lot of economic rationale behind why such online stores are actually good. Creating artificial scarcity just because you are against overconsumotion will cause a deadweight loss,ie, it will hurt the wrong people. The issue is that their negative effects (overconsumption) aren't internalized because no single country in the world gives a shit about regulating to protect the global environment. But that's not an amazon business model problem. It's a political problem."
2563,2020-06-26 11:02:20,hfxt8u,"There actually is research on this. Last mile delivery adds the biggest percentage of carbon footprint. Delivery companies do save in this regard, with more efficient routing than people do.  
  
And I‚Äôm not an Amazon shill, you can read my comments where I talk shit about their systemic issues with regards to fake products being sold by Amazon themselves."
2564,2020-06-26 09:32:09,hfxt8u,"One thing that does worry me is how amazon has a lot of overseas sellers which transport by air (of course aliexpress is even worse in that regard), or at least sellers that require plane transport. This raises emissions tremendously, probably, when compared to container ships (and, within the US, often container trains transport a sizeable amount of goods across the country as well).

But intuitively I would say that door to door deliveries are better than shop buying for that last part of the journey. So yea. I wonder which effect dominates. There's also some general equilibrium effects, like, these websites offer a level of competitiveness that makes stuff cheaper which means people will consume more which also affects the environment. But I bet there's research being done into it right now"

2576,2020-06-26 14:04:26,hfxt8u,I spent four years working at Amazon.  It's not easy but your statement is exaggerating.  The farm work and landscaping I did growing up were much much harder.
2577,2020-06-26 06:45:47,hfxt8u,"Yeah I've read ready-to-cook meal services such as blue apron are on average a net positive for the environment, despite their stupid amounts of plastic packaging. The reason for that is exactly what you mentioned--fewer trips to the grocery stores. Of course, biking to the farmers market blows both of these out of the water, environmentally speaking."
2578,2020-06-26 06:48:35,hfxt8u,It also increased overall consumption of people. So it's a bit of false equivalency to compare those two transport methods.
2579,2020-06-26 06:01:58,hfxt8u,"Not everyone drives their own car to the store to buy things, you can walk or bike or take the bus or the subway. Also, Amazon puts cars on the road to bring these packages to people's doors, even if they deliver a bunch of packages at once."
2580,2020-06-26 03:22:54,hfxt8u,Luckily consumption of goods does not exist in a vacuum.

2584,2020-06-26 03:04:19,hfxt8u,"Like how Amazon tried to oust Kshama Sawant, one of the single best elected officials in the entire United States, out of her City Council spot because they really don't like how radical she is."
2585,2020-06-26 17:51:02,hfxt8u,"That's a van full of packages, not an individual person driving. I'd actually argue that you're probably worse for the environment if you're driving a gas car just to pick up something you don't need. It's the same concept as when you were a kid taking a bus to school with other kids instead of everyone's parents driving them to school. The more stuff being carried the better for the environment. Instead of 100 people making individual trips in their own cars, you have 1 van going through a route. There's also the fact that they're changing to electric asap.

Spending that amount of money is great since, but when you scratch the surface it looks more like a company spending money to replace / upgrade machinery so they can keep the wheels turning instead of coming to a grinding halt.

Anyone who isn't a Socialist either only pretends to care or is ignorant that their preferred ideology is incapable of solving climate change. I have sympathies towards the latter, but disdain towards the former. Capitalism is entirely unequipped to handling an unprofitable problem like climate change. You cannot solve climate change in a world where the profit motive dictates everything.

>How did that work for the USSR? China? Vietnam? Ethiopia? n Korea? Cuba? Which is still redistributing wealth today?

And I don't know why you think this is some sort of a gotcha but no, I don't think Amazon alone should pay everyone a living wage. I think everyone should be given enough money and resources to live. If a business can't afford to pay people that living wage, that the business is unsustainable without exploiting their own workers and therfore should not exist in the first place."

I like a decent amount of the divisions but I think the IND/CLE/TOR/WASH division is pretty wonky too IMO. Memphis is basically the same distance from Atlanta and New Orleans, I think it‚Äôs less than 10 mile difference. 

I think the NBA is headed toward the 3 conference model splitting it up West/Central/East instead of expansion, with 10 teams in each. Problem with that is I feel like someone has to move out west from the east and it sucks to theorize uprooting someone like Cleveland or Charlotte. A playoffs with the top 5 of each conference and 1 at large bid would be the way to go here.

I‚Äôm annoyed at the scheduling too lol. It should 4x3x2 with 4 games against same division (4x4), 3 against different division (10x3) but same conference, and 2 against opposite conference (15x2). Totaling 76 games."

See this just doesn‚Äôt make any sense to me. The amount of impact a 500k check can make when compared to 30 bucks is so drastic I don‚Äôt even feel like this should be an argument. I don‚Äôt care how much a person is worth if they donated 500k to a good cause, they did a good thing. Shitting on people for participating in charity is childish, ignores basic facts of reality, and puts yourself on a holier than thou pedestal that doesn‚Äôt even have a valid base. 

I don‚Äôt know why you feel the need to call me names because I don‚Äôt expect the rich to be superheroes or even better than the average person. Our government shouldn‚Äôt be so susceptible to rich influence and shouldn‚Äôt bend over backwards to appease them. I blame the system designed for the rich to exploit them."

2646,2020-06-26 16:47:00,hfxt8u,"""Didn't generate profit"" is such bullshit though.  There's a massive difference between: 

""We've been struggling as a company and just now turned a profit and begin rewarding our investors who stuck with us, making good on the capital they gave us at the beginning.""

AND

""We've poured all profits every single year into expansion to aggressively capture additional markets and sectors of online and in-person retail""

The former is what people can relate to and think of when you say ""didn't generate profit"".  It's a path every small business in America hopes to walk, to eventually grow and profit reasonably to either pay back investors or finally reward an owner who probably risked their whole net worth on start-up.

The second, Amazon's situation, is misleading at best, and exploiting tax loopholes to defraud the American people at worst.  They've had profitable business lines within the Amazon conglomerate for decades now, and just pour that profit into buying their way into other business lines at a loss in order to capture market share and push smaller businesses out, and then get rewarded with tax write-offs from our corporate loving tax code.

The better measure here is ROI.  Yes, that can be irrationally inflated by bad investors in start-ups, but that's clearly not the case here.  If you invested at the beginning, by 2015 you'd already made an obscene ROI, which has only become more obscene since then.

Also, not saying you are defending Amazon here, just wanted to put this in so people know not to believe the lie of ""not generating profit""."
2647,2020-06-26 14:19:26,hfxt8u,"Oh yeah, then tell me? Last I checked Amazon warehouse workers are treated like fucking dogshit. Good PR moves doesn't excuse Bezos for being a corporate stiff."

2649,2020-06-26 23:41:00,hfxt8u,"I don't know why you are talking about mail? I'm not pretending that Amazon is somehow worse than other online retailers who use the mail service, in fact the opposite is probably true on a per package rate I am sure Amazon is more efficient with carbon emission then their smaller competitors. I am talking about the cultural shift from in store to online shopping of which Amazon is both the symbolic figurehead and also the biggest force accelerating the transition. I am talking about the fundamental difference in supply chains. Stores like Costco and Walmart have an innovatory supply chain which allows for mass transport of goods through primarily boats, trains, and semis. With Amazon they need a much more dynamic supply chain that can supply every pocket of america with quick access to the same innovatory of goods no matter where they live, this requires more planes and smaller  vehicles (like delivery vans) as well as much more extra transportation between between warehouses."
2650,2020-06-26 22:58:17,hfxt8u,"That doesn't really hold up to any critical thought though. First it assumes that people are *replacing* car trips in exchange for online shopping, which is often not the case. Also its assuming the merchandise bought from online shopping orders would not have been bought all in one trip as is normal for a consumer going to shopping malls or mega stores. Also their is way more packaging involved with an individual delivery than the same item bought in Walmart that was shipped in mass."
2651,2020-06-26 23:01:37,hfxt8u,You think Americans just stop driving places because they can get items delivered to their home? Have you seen the traffic everywhere(Pre-corona)? Not everybody lives like a Twitch streamer lol.

Wealth tax is definitely needed.

Social influence and heavy pollution taxes to make companies go green sooner rather than later

Closing tax loops for large corporations like how Amazon takes advantage of stock based compensation for their executives as a tax deductible

Increasing minimum wage for corporations and requiring a certain minimum of full benefits costs to avoid fines that would outweigh if they just provide the benefits"
2657,2020-06-26 14:07:39,hfxt8u,"Nah, people working at Amazon right now are literally being sacrificed at the altar of capital.  I‚Äôm not talking about the physical work as much as that.  People being fed into the woodchipper so Bezos can buy an arena or build a space colony."
2658,2020-06-26 09:15:55,hfxt8u,"So basically people are getting more stuff than before, more efficiently than before. How is that bad? 

This is like wanting food to arrive to the grocery store in many small cars instead of a big truck. If the food arrived in small cars then it‚Äôd be more expensive and less available which reduces consumption. 

There are much better ways to reduce our carbon footprint than just being inefficient."

They're both capital owning dogs who have infiltrated our media and propagandized particular sects of the proles to believe they're both good people worth drawing another breath. Just because Bezos has mildly more acceptable social policy (of which he does nothing to enact because it would go against his broader Capitalist ideology) doesn't mean they're wildly different. They're both Capitalists who would rather see the entire world burn to death with them at the very top of the pile vs giving up their obscene wealth and almost immediately fixing worldwide problems.

You should read just a tiny bit of Chomsky to educate yourself and recognize that the ideological window in America is VERY very narrow for a reason. Media like the Washington Post and New York Times gives the impression that there's a very healthy and dense debate between ""the left"" and ""the right"" when the reality is that at a base ideological level, the difference between Bezos and Koch is almost nothing."
2665,2020-06-26 03:22:45,hfxt8u,they're not that different

2674,2020-06-26 05:54:44,hfxt8u,"Lmao, you people will find a way to bitch about anything. $15 minimum wages go a long way in the cities where Amazon tends to operate its wearhouses. $15 might not go a long way in New York or San Francisco... but most people don‚Äôt live in these ultra expensive metropolitan areas. $15 minimum is an annual salary of $30k and that‚Äôs starting. Amazon wearhouse workers tend to be paid more the more experience they get. 

Also, this idea that Amazon is squeezing everyone out... Amazon didn‚Äôt have the ability to suppress prices for years and yet people still adopted their services. People initially bought into Amazon because they loved the idea of having shit delivered to them. The better prices came later as the company grew ever larger to compete with the likes of Walmart and other retailers around the world. No one is forcing people to buy shit on Amazon, and yet here we are."

I personally lived on $15/hr in an expensive college city near NYC paying $1200/month for rent+utilities. It's definitely not enough for someone with kids, but you really shouldn't be having kids as a single parent working a lower wage job. Two parents making $15/hr can pay the bills though. Especially since you can get overtime whenever and get time and a half if you need that extra kick. You actually get a ton of benefits at Amazon. Cheap comprehensive insurance for health, vision, and dental with other stuff like pre-tax commuter stuff, free career development classes, and if you work for I think a year or maybe it's two you can get a full vocational/associates degree for stuff like IT, being a dental assistant, and etc. All of this for literally no experience, resume, or interview process. It was my first 'real' job I had where I had to punch in and out and stuff and was way better than I expected compared to everyone else I knew. Made as much or more than people that were interning or working full-time jobs when I was in school since most pay $11\~13/hr."

A young woman from the Philippines employed by a US company for $5 an hour would give her more than enough to live comfortably, easily a living wage for her standards. Give that same amount to a young American woman and she'd be out of a home when rent day arrives. If we say $15 an hour is a living wage for her and the company provides it, then fine, Amazon pays a living wage. However, that doesn't change the fact that both of these workers are inherently exploited by their bosses because their labor creates a profit that the bosses get to keep for themselves. 

But I'm sure you already know that there are different standards of living in different countries and communities so what is exactly is my point? The ethical action, of course, is to hand the means of production to the workers so all the income is spread to the laborers who made the company possible in tbe first place. But of course that's not going to happen right now, so what is it really? The main point is that, for a company of Amazon's size and a person of Bezos' wealth, the basic thing to do is to give their workers enough money to of a wage to live comfortably without the threat of being impoverished. Yet they can't even do that basic thing right. They exploit their workers for profit and let them die when it means they get to be richer than sin.

My guess is that credible historians in say the 2070s will be even more skeptical that we have a responsive democratic system that abides by democratic principle or really is accountable to its people.

2805,2020-06-26 15:38:02,hfxt8u,"Exactly. And if we wanted our delivery services more environmentally friendly, then it should be up to FedEx, UPS, USPS and any other delivery services to make the switch to have more electric delivery trucks. That's not on Amazon."

To take it to a more extreme example, if northern states in the 1800s used products from slave labor, would you have told them to shut the fuck up when they started fighting against slavery?"
2809,2020-06-26 05:18:14,hfxt8u,"No shit I'm arguing for communism, I didn't think that was anything I was trying to hide?

I don't know how much I can keep repeating this, but the point is that *giving a definite number to a living wage is effectively useless because the value changes depending on the circumstance* and even more importantly, **paying someone a living wage is the most basic thing you could provide for your worker**. A $5 wage can be a living wage for someone in the Philippines and impossible for someone in the US, but simply giving your workers enough money to live shouldn't be the end of the discussion. 

A $15 wage can be enough for someone to live on, but it doesn't remove the company's exploitation of the worker that's inherent to the system's survival."
2810,2020-06-26 05:07:47,hfxt8u,"lmao the basic concept of socialism is being a tankie now? That's like calling Rousseau a communist after reading the first line of The Social Contract.

I don't think you got the point at all. Yes, worker cooperatives exist but the main topic is the exploitation of laborers WITHIN companies like Amazon, not some theoretical group of laborers who are free to choose between creating  cooperatives or working under a capitalist system. We're currently living in that capitalist system, which means  that any kind of worker-led resistance will get disincentivized or even outright squashed. Just look at how much Walmart spends on union busting alone. 

Also I don't see where I advocated for a more centralized power?"

And I'd say that a look at Scandinavia and other places (shows that private enterprise is useful but it can't run the economy if you want an economy that can grow while handling shocks like Covid or 2008 or ironically enough, whatever climate change brings us...

*State-owned enterprises (SOEs), defined as commercial enterprises in which the state has a controlling stake or large minority stake, are also far more prevalent in the Nordic countries. In 2012, the value of Norwegian SOEs was equal to 87.9 percent of the country‚Äôs GDP. For Finland, that figure was 52.3 percent. In the US, it was not even 1 percent.*

Shouldn‚Äôt you be blaming the system and the government and laws for allowing him to treat his employees poorly?

As if he‚Äôs the only company to overwork and undervalue his employees?

There‚Äôs thousands of companies that treat their employees the same way amazon treats theirs, you simply don‚Äôt hear about it because amazon is a massive monopoly.

The reality is you‚Äôre hating the player for being part of the game that gives them too much freedom. It‚Äôs the US government/corporate structure that you should be mad at for allowing these massively rich humans to become who they are, not the one billionaire. The one billionaire asshole is not the problem, it‚Äôs the structure of the American economy. 

All idiots on reddit love to just shit on billionaires and praise bernie but where were Bernies votes at the polls? They‚Äôre all bark and no bite. Blame the government, protest amazon, and to the employees being undervalued - quit your job if you want to better yourself on a personal level.

I‚Äôll let you guess what happens to amazon value as soon as bezos starts selling off. The vast majority of his ‚Äúnet worth‚Äù is basically imaginary. Because as soon as he starts selling off the shares he‚Äôs selling would be worth a fraction of their current worth. But hey, keep sounding dumb buddy."

My argument is specifically that you jumped to an ad hominem attacks on someone you disagreed with, and the attack was logically weak.

I generally don't think you convince anybody when you start attacking someone. You definitely don't when your attack is illogical."

I try to support local businesses and mom-and-pops, but I still end up buying through Amazon quite a bit because it is so convenient. Frankly I think the issues with Amazon need to be addressed by the government. The reason I‚Äôve been defending them a bit is that I think the fact they offer a useful product is a check in the plus column when discussing the morality of the company and of Bezos‚Äôs wealth.

2878,2020-06-30 13:23:55,himgen,"Definitely tricky stuff on the gate. Clever!

But I'd look at the capture more - 16dBA self noise for the mic isn't too noisy (although some mics are down at 7dB). I say get right up on the mic but experiment with where it is in relation to your mouth - somewhere really close but possibly not directly in front of you. Definitely with the pop filter. I'd also try more gain on the Focusrite- You can record higher than -28dB without penalty.

I'd look at saturation/distortion effects to add a small amount of excitement/umph. And I'm a big believer in automating vocal levels in the mix - make that fader wiggle!"
2879,2020-06-30 13:18:33,himgen,"Stating the obvious, start at the source as much as is possible. The level of your voice in the room should only affect signal to noise. There's no other issue caused by a lower level vocal that I've ever experienced. I would therefore respectfully suggest any other issues are best addressed at the source. This includes the voice itself (mic technique, singing more consistently with regards to level and intensity, plus the mic and also the room which will come more into play when cranking the mic that much to pickup a lower level source.

Noise WILL always be an issue when recording softer sources, and you can't just use ANY mic/preamp in these situations - you may need to shop around a little before you find the right mic for you - but this is ALWAYS true about microphones.

The room is also something to consider, and making it more dead for your vocals is a good place to start. Be aware of what's BEHIND you - that's where the mic is most sensitive. Sometimes I see folks singing into a wall or corner to try to deaden the sound, but more often in my experience that wall/corner may work more in your favor if it's behind YOU. Ideally a smaller enclosed space, aka ""vocal booth"" may be an option, even if it's built with mic stands and packing blankets!

As you'll never totally eliminate the noise, the goal is to reduce it to the point it no longer causes any problems in the mix. All the ""tricks"" to reduce it at the mix stage are going to come with their own side-effects - so always better to do as MUCH as possible at the tracking stage."
2880,2020-06-30 14:01:29,himgen,"I think I have a similar voice with similar style of music and I‚Äôve found that layering a bunch of different vocal tracks is the biggest thing I can do to make my voice sound better.

Saturation works wonders as well. Automating the volume (and making the compression more subtle) is another good suggestion."
2881,2020-06-30 15:57:34,himgen,"Use Reafir to sample and remove the noise floor. It's works like magic. Its a game changer (steps are in the manual).

Try the built in JS Exciter for a little grit and harmonics (use lightly). For my voice I set the filter pretty low (where most of the energy in my voice is). It brings it out of the muddy range nicely."
2882,2020-07-01 09:38:22,himgen,"Get the vocalist closer to the mic, turn the gain up until you have pretty solid level coming in (not clipping, though) and then gate the noise and compress *heavily*. 

Getting close to the mic with help reduce background noise, and as a pleasant side effect can make soft, quiet vocalists sound more intimate."
2883,2020-06-30 12:34:27,himgen,Instead of turning up the vocals try turning down all the other instruments?
2884,2020-06-30 13:50:15,himgen,"When you get your environment issues sorted try doing multiple tracks of your voice so that you can make it sound bigger without being physically louder.

You will have to get your noise issues sorted first before you do that cause the noise floor will also increase as well.  

For mixing I really like the volume automation suggestions, it can really help with it sitting in the mix.  It can also bring your performance to life!"
2885,2020-06-30 14:05:21,himgen,"You can sing really close to the condenser mic - 2-3‚Äù, say - while still having the pop filter in between. Also, there are mini vocal booths that sit on a mic stand - you can buy them on sweetwater or amazon, and they‚Äôre not expensive. 
As for making it sit in the mix, an important factor here is the arrangement. Rule of thumb: leave some space in the frequency-range for your voice to fill. For instance, you can gently eq guitar and keyboard parts, lowering the frequency-range occupied by your voice."
2886,2020-06-30 14:28:27,himgen,"Recordings in an untreated room will always be a problem. Equally poor singing technique is something you can‚Äôt edit out. It sounds to me like you‚Äôre using a lot of falsetto/head voice with no support.

Soft voices are done with lots of compression, but you should try not one compression reducing a lot, but a few compressions in different stages of your chain reducing less. Ie, instead of having one compressor at the beginning of your chain doing -10db, let 3 of them take off 5-7 or something, whatever feels right.

Also throw in a soft acting X-noise close to the end."

I've thought about buying some moving blankets. How well do they work compared to towels or cheapo acoustic panels? 

Also, my struggle there is figuring out what to hang them on. I currently own one boom mic stand, which I am using for the Mic. Do you know another way of suspending the blankets?

Also how would that method compare to investing in something like a small Mic shield?"
2890,2020-06-30 14:06:23,himgen,What do you use for vocal saturation?
2891,2020-06-30 21:39:59,himgen,Yeah. How do they do that? It doesn't sound over compressed or boosted or noisy or anything.

2893,2020-06-30 14:57:38,himgen,[Softube‚Äôs free saturation knob](https://www.softube.com/saturationknob)
2894,2020-06-30 16:54:06,himgen,Decapitator is nice because it has a 'Dark - Bright' knob. Other plugins may have it. You could try recording several takes and then saturate and darken the extra takes so you get more body but without the breathy sounds.
2895,2020-07-03 04:36:00,himgen,"- there is some acoustic treatment.  She's sitting in front of a pretty big diffuser.  Who knows what treatment is on the other side of the camera. 

- she's up really close to the mic.  The closer you are, the better your signal/noise ratio is going to be.  That's true regardless of how loud you are.  

- they are singing into several thousand dollars worth of microphones

- the mix itself isn't compressed a ton and the mastering is gentle, so the sound of the room noise isn't going to be as apparent.  
 

the most important thing that you can do, without buying anything or changing anything about your setup, is get as close to the mic as you can when you sing softly.  Your voice is going to sound really different than you're used too, and you will most likely need to EQ bass out of the recording, but you'll notice that the room noise is much lower in comparison to your singing.  

quick note - when I'm talking about  the signal to noise ratio, ""signal"" means your voice, and ""noise"" means the room noise.  the self-noise of the microphone has nothing to do with the issues you're having.  

hope this helps!"

2923,2020-06-30 00:40:51,hiclp3,"I don't like Billie Eilish or Selena Gomez. I don't like Whitney Houston either, so.

But then, I don't listen to Billie Ellish's genre of music, nor Selena Gomez, nor Whitney Houston's. And each of those singers is a unique performance artist for their particular genre.

Whether someone's singing style is highly varied in tone and loudness versus a consistent tonality or medium range of high notes and low notes is kind of subjectively irrelevant.

If you think Leonard Cohen is a great singer, that's fine. If you think Pavoratti is a BETTER singer than Leonard Cohen, I'd say you have no basis to make that claim other than personal preferences.

A Tuvan throat singer might be the most amazing singer ***for that genre***, but if you're judging that singer against, say, Zac Effron, when it comes to American Broadway musical singing styles, that's not exactly what I'd call an objective opinion, because let's see Zac Effron use the Tuvan throat singing technique.

Likewise, calling said Tuvan throat singer the best singer ever is also ignoring the fact that for that particular genre, they're a defining performer but for every other genre? Not so much."

Because you‚Äôre faulting the democrats for not being able to defend our rights being stripped from us **by republicans**

What you should have said is, **republicans are taking away our rights and have made the democrats powerless to stop them.** which is more accurate, as it‚Äôs not the democrats fault that the other party is forcing the conversation to start at rights, with democrats *responding* by defending our rights how best they can.

>The name libcom is an abbreviation of ""libertarian communism"", the political idea we identify with. Libertarian communism is the political expression of the ever-present strands of co-operation and solidarity in human societies. These currents of mutual aid can be found throughout society. In tiny everyday examples such as people collectively organising a meal, or helping a stranger carry a pram down a flight of stairs. They can also manifest themselves in more visible ways, such as one group of workers having a solidarity strike in support of other workers as the BA baggage handlers did for Gate Gourmet catering staff in 2005. They can also explode and become a predominant force in society such as in the events across Argentina in 2001, in Portugal 1974, Italy in the 1960s-70s, France 1968, Hungary '56, Spain 1936, Russia 1917, Paris 1871‚Ä¶

> We identify primarily with the trends of working-class solidarity, co-operation, direct action and struggle throughout history: whether those movements are self-consciously libertarian communist (as in the Spanish revolution) or not; whether they identify explicitly as class movements or as movements against systemic inequalities under capitalism such as the anti-racist, LGBT and women's movements. We are also influenced by certain specific theoretical and practical traditions, such as anarchist-communism, anarcho-syndicalism, black liberation, council communism, feminism, ultra-left Marxism, left communism, and others.

> We have sympathies with writers and organisations including Karl Marx, Gilles Dauv√©, CLR James, Rosa Luxemburg, Maurice Brinton, Mariarosa dalla Costa, Ambalavaner Sivanandan, Martin Glaberman, Anton Pannekoek, Wildcat Germany, League of Revolutionary Black Workers, Anarchist Federation, Solidarity Federation, prole.info, Asian Youth Movements, Aufheben, Solidarity, the situationists, Mujeres Libres, Spanish CNT and others.

> However, we recognise the limitations of applying these ideas and organisational forms to contemporary society. We emphasise understanding and transforming the social relationships we experience here and now in our everyday lives to better our circumstances and protect the planet, whilst still learning from the mistakes and successes of previous working class movements and ideas.

> Billie Eilish Pirate Baird O'Connell (born December 18, 2001), known professionally as Billie Eilish, is a Grammy Award-Winning American singer and songwriter signed to Interscope Records. California singer and dancer debuted her ethereal indie electro-pop sound when she was barely a teenager. Born and raised in Los Angeles, Eilish grew up in a household of actors and musicians and was homeschooled along with her brother Finneas O'Connell (the Slightlys). At the age of eight, she joined the Los Angeles Children's Choir, developing the soulful vocals that would later appear on her early singles. After the release of ""Six Feet Under"" and ""Fingers Crossed,"" Eilish made her breakthrough with ""Ocean Eyes,"" produced and co-written with her brother Finneas and released by Interscope. It surpassed 14 million online streams and spawned a number of remixes with Astronomyy, Blackbear, and Goldhouse. Eilish followed up in February 2017 with ""Bellyache,"" then landed another track, ""Bored,"" on the Netflix series 13 Reasons Why. An EP, dont smile at me, featuring the singles ""COPYCAT"" and ""watch,"" followed later that summer. Her debut full-length album titled ""When We Fall Asleep, Where Do We All Go?"" has been released March 29th, 2019 via Interscope Records. 

> On January 26, 2020, she won five Grammys, including the ""big four"" awards: Best Album, Best Record, Best Song, and Best New Artist. On February 18th 2020, she won a Brit Award for International Female Solo Artist and for the first time performed her new Bond theme song ""No Time To Die"" and was joined by composer Hans Zimmer, guitar legend Johnny Marr and her brother Finneas. Eilish is the youngest musician to have ever performed the theme song for a Bond Movie. Read more on Last.fm.

3458,2020-09-07 03:44:22,io02hs,"Only thing i could add here to hopefully marry your idea with those that oppose it is that you can claim to have depression, even to the point that you are basically a dummy or vegetable, barely able to keep yourself alive and thats ok and acceptable. But what else is ok is for people to still have expectations of you regardless of your depression and to show disappointed and disapproval at your depressed lifestyle, attitude and motivation even to the point where you are disregarded all together by that person and lose that relationship all together.

What i hate is when people (including myself at times) expect others to understand and except there life and its circumstances while they are suffering from deppression but can't handle the fact others are naturally repulsed and disappointed by that lifestyle and what it brings to a relationship. Its natural and real to feel depressed but is equally as natural and real to be repulsed and disappointed by someone's depressed state of mind and attitudes.

Hope it makes sense"

I KNOW it's for the views, for the money-money-money, cos that's all subhumans care about. Pathetic.

But the worst thing is how they pretend to love the song (or any other extreme metal song, for the matter) and being ""shocked"" about it's sheer heaviness (not that it isn't. It's just painfully obvious these people are acting and everyone's just fucking falling for it). Trust me. Once they stopped recording their cocksucking overreaction videos, they'll never ever gonna fucking listen to that song ever again, and put in some mumble rap or cheesy Judas Priest (them ""metal"" grannies... so cringy) soon after that. They don't like it. It's not their style of music BUT THAT'S PERFECTLY FINE. I just hate the dishonesty for sucking views.

Why can't we live in a world where honesty is considered a virtuosy and people are. not. fucking. lying. all. the. time.

If you couldn't tell so far, yes, I think these so called ""reaction videos"" are like the stupidest things ever IMO. And I refuse to support them, as they are literally getting views Alex and his band deserves, plus there's no creative work behind these reaction videos at all. They really are stealing other people's work.

Mainstream metal has already become a fashion mania, with all these thots wearing Metallica shirts n stuff without even knowing one fucking song from them. Posers disgust me so much. I don't want deathcore and extreme metal to become a fashion as well, but I'm afraid where gonna have, ten years from now, hoes with Cannibal Corpse and Suffocation shirts.

Er- Title. Promise this isn't a troll, if it sounds that way. On a throwaway account.

He always goes on about ""billie"", which I think sounds.. a little creepy? Calling her by her first name, ranting about how people think she's ""faking her depression"", and all that. You get what he's like.

My main issue is that it's 24/7. In our dms. Random song lyrics. Random pictures.

The pictures are the absolute worst part. I've had a little boost of confidence in my appearance lately, as my hair is looking very shiny and is very soft lately. Very happy about that ;) I started to talk, but then friend started going on about how billie eilish is prettier than all 3 of us in the DM combined. I wanted to call him out, saying this isn't very.. good of him? I've been encouraging him about his looks since he's got low self esteem, but I don't really appreciate him babbling on about how his hero is prettier than all of us. It kinda hurts. It's also getting a lot more annoying lately, so WIBTA if I called him out, saying he's being completely annoying and innapropriate? What would be the best route to take?

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
3519,2020-09-06 16:33:37,inosue,NTA but if he‚Äôs a good friend maybe just call him in about how the pictures and comparisons make you feel. I think that‚Äôll give better results than just calling out his obsession.
3520,2020-09-06 16:41:53,inosue,"NTA, but right to proceed carefully. Not because I think you would do anything arsehole-ish but because it sounds like your friend is in quite a vulnerable place right now and I'd hate the friendship to be ruined.

I've clung hard to stuff in the past because I didn't really like who I was and it gave me almost an external sense of self that I could approve of. It sounds like maybe Billie Eilish is providing that role for your friend. At this point, criticising her could feel like you are criticising him, so tread carefully. 

That said, you're well within your rights to set some boundaries. Let's call your friend Bob. You could try things like,
""Hey Bob, I've noticed you've been talking a lot about Billie Eilish lately and I'm so glad you have something to be excited about. We're not into her like you are though and we miss talking with you about other stuff, do you think you could join in some of our conversations without making it all about Billie? We'd love for you to know about our interests too.""
Show him that you value HIM as a person, you want his participation and actually he's getting in the way of himself joining in by sticking so rigidly to this one topic.

Also worth considering is whether your friend might have any neurodiversities that can manifest as having special interests. If that's the case then this is kinda just how he's wired but I'm sure there are plenty of resources out there on how to maintain friendships with someone with a special interest."

Something I didn't mention in the post that I should have, now that I think about it, is that sometimes we'll be having our conversations in the DM, and he'll just send song lyrics or speaking about how beautiful she is.

The two Hexvessel albums are pretty light for the most part and fit other moods than aggression.

3565,2020-09-06 13:41:27,inm6m4,"jpgnicky has posted their work for feedback. Here are some top tips for posting high quality feedback.
* Read their context comment. All work on this sub should have a comment explaining the thinking behind the piece. Read this before posting 
to understand what jpgnicky was trying to do.
* Be professional. No matter your thoughts on the work, respect the effort put into making it and be polite when posting. 
* Be constructive and detailed. Short, vague comments are unhelpful. Instead of just leaving your opinion on the piece, explore *why* you 
hold that opinion: what makes the piece good or bad? How could it be improved? Are some elements stronger than others?
* Remember design fundamentals. If your feedback is focussed on basic principles of design such as hierarchy, flow, balance, and 
proportion, it will be universally useful. And remember that this is graphic design: the piece should communicate a message or solve a 
problem. How well does it do that?
* Stay on-topic. We know that design can sometimes be political or controversial, but please keep comments focussed on the design itself, 
and the strengths/weaknesses thereof.

I think it would be really good if you drew and after you recorded your drawing, you speed that video up and then talk over the video afterwards. For example lets say you have 30 minute drawing and you record the process of drawing it and then you speed the video up so the duration is 6 minutes(for example) then after that you record your voice explaining some stuff over the video and you edit them together with a nice background music and it would become great! Your videos are great as they are but O rhink if you do these thwy would be even greater ;D"

3626,2020-10-12 07:40:29,j8culd,"I watched your video and as always it was great! If I am not wrong you used my suggestion in the last 3 to 4 minutes of your video, correct? None the less it was very well done :). One more thing that I think if you fix will help you greatly is to lower the music volume down so it doesn't cover your own voice, so that overall your voice is heard more than the music and the music is just a mere background audio. If you want to make the quality of your own audio even better I suggest using programs like ""Audacity"" which is free and there are tones of tutorials for it on youtube, and I think it will benefit you a lot. But all of this aside your video was as good as always; even better I think! ;D"

Self-imposed limitations (made up beliefs) prevent people from expressing themselves authentically all the time in all aspects of their lives.

3655,2020-11-09 15:47:53,jqxgh6,Shit I'm turning 25 this month and I'm having the same crisis. Got a degree in Sound Design and I've been making music since I was a kid. Now I work in a factory with no outlook on a career in audio/music.
3656,2020-11-09 16:59:11,jqxgh6,"I remember seeing this clip from this interview of James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem. He touches a lot on his ideas of failure in the music industry. He makes some great points about how age can factor into those feelings, too. This interview always makes me feel better.

https://youtu.be/yYCz06bS380"
3657,2020-11-10 08:45:38,jqxgh6,"23, I'm not saying you're a kid still, but you need some perspective on what old is. You're only just beginning to figure out who you are and what you want. I am a totally different person than I was when I was 23, and at 23, I was a totally different person than I was when I was 18. The next few years are going to change you so much, and if they don't, something's wrong.

I'm not discounting everything you know about yourself and what you want so far, and I'm certainly not telling you you're wrong about yourself (I'm just a guy on the internet, you know you), music will obviously be a huge part of your life, but I promise there is more you have yet to uncover.

My point with the above is simply to tell you that even though you might feel like this is it (in many different aspects of life), 20 to 30 is probably the period where you will do the most death and rebirth of yourself in your life. I feel like every year I was a different person and it's only now starting to level out a little. I know everyone is different but people also aren't that different and I was a 23 year old overthinker at one point too.

I'm 31 dude and I don't even consider myself old. Don't compare yourself to popular figures, or anyone for that matter. The only person you should be comparing yourself to is the you you were yesterday.

It's likely that those arists got incredibly lucky and were picked up by a label with the full weight of a professional promo team and a bunch of money behind them. I don't know if that's the case for all of them but there are so many different circumstances you may not be aware of that contributed to their success, and remember that you are only seeing the success side of things, and even that is filtered through agents and managers and PR reps. Everything comes with a cost, there is nothing free in this life. What looks great from the outside might be hell on the inside.

Just focus on your craft and keep pushing forward. It has been my experience that slow and steady does tend to win the race, even if the runner spends quite a bit of time wondering when the fuck this will finally pay off. 

Every great success I ever heard speak about their journey didn't have a plan b either. The safe road is usually pretty fucking disappointing, but the dangerous road is pretty fucking dangerous, life sucks that way, we didn't choose it and it only gets harder.

That being said, you might as well give it your all. Drive 2 hours for a 10 minute spot, stay up late, buy that thing you need, figure it out, make it happen or it never will. If you honestly think you have something special, never stop moving forward with it, and never give up, and if it doesn't happen, hopefully you had some fun, learned a shit load, and most importantly, you won't have any nagging regrets.

Everything is preparing you for the next thing, it helps me to remember that in times of hardship.

Edit: refined my thoughts a few times."

It all depends on what you mean by success, but if the reason you're doing is only to get super popular then maybe rethink it? There is a huge chance of getting disappointed. If it doesn't stop you from working and making money for living why does it matter? It makes you happy so keep doing it."

3662,2020-11-09 16:25:24,jqxgh6,"I think the issue is young musicians stand out more

Try to take note or make a list of musicians who made it big when they were older

Off the top of my head

Sufjan Stevens,
Justin Vernon (Bon Iver),
Elliott Smith,
Jeff Buckley

Those guys made it big in their mid to late 20s"
3663,2020-11-09 20:31:41,jqxgh6,"You need to start looking at the artists who made it when they were older. I like to think about James Murphy from LCD Soundsystem when I feel discouraged by my age. He didn't make it until he was 33. 

Another one is Michael Gira from Swans (who had a successful band when he was younger), but he didn't make the Seer until he was in his 50s, and that album made him way more successful and he went on to make 2 more absolutely incredible albums after that.

Also the Radiohead guys made it when they were only a bit older than you, but they didn't release what I consider their best material until they were mid 30s.

I know the second 2 are my opinions but I think these are great ways to think if you don't want to let your age discourage you. You have your entire life to become what you want to be. Which is like 10x longer than the 6 years you've been trying to make it as an artist. You won't even be 30 yet when you've worked on stuff twice as long as you have lol."

I thought I would very successful by 23 but I didn't achieve that level of success I thought I would get. I'm still hoping one day I would be successful like my idols or even more successful than them. I just have to figure out how can I do that.

One thing I'd suggest is to look for jobs that are even remotely related to music. Sweep floors at a venue or studio, work at a music store, anything that will get you closer to that world. You never know who you might meet, maybe you work at guitar center and talk to a guy who owns a studio and is looking to hire. Just try and get yourself in and around music in your professional life so there's a greater chance of making the right connections."

Even then, what‚Äôs learned in school doesn‚Äôt dictate intelligence as a whole. While it does spark it through teaching students useful information and concepts, some people are simply born with a larger capacity to learn and analyze and intelligence isn‚Äôt limited to informational knowledge."

3754,2020-11-08 17:11:59,jqf8z8,"Comments regarding Dune:
- ‚ÄúI truly was a fan of Dune as a teenager and Denis Villeneuve [the director] started talking about it a little bit. What he wanted to do was be as loyal and true to the novel as you could be and the more he was telling me about it, the more he was drawing me back in. He was telling me a story that I remembered from my teenage years ‚Äì it truly started to resonate again. All these bits came back and, suddenly, a sound and a score started forming, during those conversations.‚Äù

- ‚ÄúDenis and I spent a long evening in a great restaurant in Montreal, with just the right amount of wine it took for me to understand perfectly what he meant ‚Äì I think! I've worked, obviously, with Denis a little bit on Blade Runner¬†[2049], so we know each other. I feel my job is to not only embrace the aesthetic, but sit and push it and do things that come in mind [that] he couldn't think of. But Joe Walker, our editor, who has a better musical education [than I do], I asked because I really trust him. Just the other day, he took a piece of my music, which was not meant for the scene he put it over and astonished me with what he did. He hears and sees things in a slightly different way. I love the idea of giving him the freedom to experiment with stuff.‚Äù

- When asked which scene Joe Walker played with: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so specific! No, hang on a second, the scene appeared in the trailer. It's the Gom Jabbar [scene], where the needle is against Paul's neck. I'm not going to tell you what he did, but it's that scene.‚Äù"

I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone."

3870,2020-12-15 07:00:48,kdgkn7,"So apparently, the only song to date to top the Hottest 100 as a non-single is Powderfinger's ""These Days"". The song was prominently featured in the 1999 film *Two Hands*, starring Heath Ledger and Rose Byrne.

Can someone who witnessed the 1999 Hottest 100 please confirm if this was a massively popular film, and if it played a big factor to the song winning the Hottest 100 that year? I was too young to witness this for myself."
3871,2020-12-15 08:02:42,kdgkn7,"These Days will probably be the only B-side to ever top a hottest 100, considering the fact B-Sides aren‚Äôt a thing anymore"
3872,2020-12-15 06:59:23,kdgkn7,This is so interesting thank you! These Days is certainly an amazing song huh
3873,2020-12-15 07:34:37,kdgkn7,When your album's just so good it must be tough to decide on the singles. I love 5/5 of the singles from Sunlight so I can't complain.
3874,2020-12-29 23:49:33,kdgkn7,"""Booster Seat"" is now a single, they've just released it as one.

Edited to correct typo"
3875,2020-12-15 09:10:29,kdgkn7,"This isn‚Äôt a spoiler man. Pretty shit of you to delete on a whim. It‚Äôs literally all old data!

I considered tagging it as a spoiler but there‚Äôs no predictions or even discussions about who has the best chance of winning. Saying ‚ÄúBooster Seat is one of the favourites‚Äù is not telling anyone anything they don‚Äôt already know!

This took me over an hour to put together, could you please reinstate it?"
3876,2020-12-15 08:14:12,kdgkn7,"moderately successful Australian movie.

I think the airplay on JJJ was the reason it won, it was not a lot to do with the movie."
3877,2020-12-15 08:10:20,kdgkn7,"I also was too young, but according to Wikipedia it won Best Film at the AFI's. Powderfinger had already had placed six times in previous countdowns, and another three entries that year from Internationalist. So maybe it was just a perfect storm of an Aussie band who'd been slowly building over the years reaching a critical mass with the right track at the right time, which had featured on a critically acclaimed film? Listening to the Hottest 100s & 1000s podcast I was surprised by how many songs from movie soundtracks made the countdown in the 90s. Given they're local and how popular they were becoming at the time it would be pretty likely Triple J had it on high rotation and many people voted for it purely off radio play. The station has never strictly stuck with single releases."
3878,2020-12-15 11:23:47,kdgkn7,"I conned my way into Two Hands (I was only 14 and it was MA15+). Great film. I do remember it being quite popular, did a lot for Heath Ledger‚Äôs popularity too (came out around the same time as Ten Things I Hate About You, so he was the next up and coming Aussie heartthrob). Got $5.5M at the Aussie box office so would have been in the top 20 at the time it was released."
3879,2020-12-15 12:21:51,kdgkn7,"I *LOVED* Two Hands on release, still do. 

It wasn't massively popular, but it was definitely popular among the right crowd, which got it airtime, and then spread to the masses."
3880,2020-12-15 11:44:07,kdgkn7,"As someone from that time...

The film was moderately popular, and usage of the song in the film is iconic, I still remember the scene.

I think the film would have given it a small bump, but it was more that the song was heavily played on triple J and Powderfinger were breaking into mainstream success."
3881,2020-12-15 12:09:32,kdgkn7,"Agree with others. Moderately popular, I saw it three weeks after release and the cinema was pretty full, I remember because my girlfriend dumped me that day.

The scene with the song is iconic, still gives me chills."
3882,2020-12-15 11:34:31,kdgkn7,"I had no idea it was in the movie, it was just a huge song. I‚Äôm shocked it wasn‚Äôt a single."
3883,2020-12-15 10:01:01,kdgkn7,"honestly im kind of surprised albums are still managing to be a thing, its just not how people seem to consume music anymore. 


Sort of tangentially ive seen a couple of bands over the last couple of years (mostly in the metal scene) release a track a week/fortnight/month for a period as singles on spotify and then when they get to the end of it all remove all the singles and repost it as an album, wonder if this will become increasingly common to ensure each track of an album gets at least some play."
3884,2020-12-29 23:58:51,kdgkn7,"Yeah I know ‚Äì although releasing a music video is not always equal to releasing a single, particularly so long after their most recent one. My point was more that at the time of voting opening, it wasn‚Äôt a single, hence it being a bit of a rarity. Regardless I hope it gets up"
3885,2020-12-15 09:30:57,kdgkn7,"False, it is telling someone who didn't know that already something they didn't already know. Literally that's what a spoiler is. Hate on me all you want but that isn't going to get the post reinstated. Following the rules of the sub and admitting your mistake might."
3886,2020-12-15 08:19:36,kdgkn7,Just read it was also the B-side to Passenger when it was released as a single. So maybe the film wasn't even a factor or just give it a small bump?
3887,2020-12-15 11:38:49,kdgkn7,"That was basically correct, it was more ""peak Powderfinger"", the overlap of their Triple J /alternative success and their mainstream success."

3889,2020-12-30 00:20:39,kdgkn7,"That's a fair point, I think they only chose to give it a single release due to its immense popularity. Personally I'm more of a ""Skin"" man myself, but I'd be happy to see both tracks in the 100.

I think ""Heat Waves"" has more of a chance of winning than the aforementioned ""Booster Seat"", it seems to have resonated a lot more over the year from what I've seen. I would be thrilled to see ""Cherub"" take the whole thing out though, reckon it's a dark horse!"
3890,2020-12-15 12:20:19,kdgkn7,Aaand unsubscribed. Fucking absurd.
3891,2020-12-15 09:33:06,kdgkn7,"Whoa, did not expect a mod to get so defensive! Okay, is it at all possible for you to reinstate the post with a spoiler tag added? Please?

Seriously, I‚Äôm not trying to be deliberately obstructive here. If I‚Äôve made an error here, it wasn‚Äôt intentional.

EDIT: I've put spoiler tags around the content that could potentially be perceived as 'spoiling'. Please let me know if this is okay, cheers."
3892,2020-12-15 10:20:02,kdgkn7,i think it was more the fact it was on the soundtrack and that caused JJJ to play it. It was a mainstream release
3893,2020-12-30 02:27:15,kdgkn7,"Would love to see BPM take it out! They have always had such an affinity towards the countdown too ‚Äì I remember Sam being genuinely disappointed when no tracks from Every Night The Same Dream made the 100 even though it came top 10 in the album poll. It inspired him to write Exactly How You Are, which was more in the traditional pop vein. He‚Äôs made no bones about really wanting to win this thing too, now that he knows Cherub is a good chance. I like his honesty."
3894,2020-12-15 09:49:00,kdgkn7,"I'm also not trying to be deliberately defensive. We have spoiler guidelines for the benefit of users who don't want to look at the warm tunas etc. before listening to the countdown, it's in the sidebar and I posted a reminder announcement about it, and your initial reply came across as willingly ignorant of it all and pretty aggressive. But yes, now I'll undelete the post."
3895,2020-12-15 04:28:21,kdenml,"Personally, this may just b me, but I absolutely would! I think it would show a lot of your creativity and musical abilities, not a lot of ppl can write their own music and be proud of it :) def go for it"
3896,2020-12-15 08:15:19,kdenml,"im no expert, but i listened to some of ur songs and u have a really nice voice!! i agree w the other comment, its a good way to showcase ur musical ability, creativity and sth ur passionate about, def go for it if you want!"
3897,2020-12-15 13:24:04,kdenml,aw thank you! so i will
3898,2020-12-15 13:24:16,kdenml,thank you so much! i will then
3899,2020-12-15 10:24:47,kddzr3,"I sold audio equipment in the 70‚Äôs and the same question that was being asked then is still plaguing the audiophile world.  Are you listening to the music or the equipment?   Having fallen into the black hole of gear(100k+) I would say I was guilty of the latter.  It wasn‚Äôt until I lost everything via a divorce and business failure that I awoke and rediscovered the music.  Now I listen to a good, not great, system (NHT, Marantz, Flac) and I freakin love music again."
3900,2020-12-15 04:13:36,kddzr3,Nope. I listen to music not my gear. Poorly mastered music I love is still music I love. Even from the speakerphone if need be
3901,2020-12-15 05:05:47,kddzr3,Classical music and jazz are actually interesting and involving on a good system. I just can't get into those genera on a regular system.
3902,2020-12-15 03:58:08,kddzr3,"I've always loved music and have been curious about hifi but I have never had the money to listen to $1000 cans and I have no friends that can afford to/are interested in high end gear, and it's statements like this that make me feel like maybe it's ok to just listen to a good pa or some middle of the road headphones ü§£"
3903,2020-12-15 15:27:22,kddzr3,Never considered Diana Krall before good gear
3904,2020-12-15 15:01:17,kddzr3,"Once I learned what the artifacts of the loudness war sound like, some music became unlistenable on good gear."
3905,2020-12-15 15:59:44,kddzr3,"While not entirely related, as a recording and mixing engineer this is a pet peeve of mine.  
A *vast* majority of the sound and sound quality of a record comes from the mix, the recording and the instruments themselves.  
A very ‚Äòbad‚Äô master can negatively affect sound quality, but most of the time the mastering engineer is just doing incredibly subtle EQ (less than +-1dB) and using a limiter to achieve commercial loudness.  

Laymen tend to use ‚Äòthe master‚Äô to describe the overall sound quality of a record, when in reality mastering is by far the *least* influential part of the process of creating a record and downplays the integral role the recording and mixing engineer(s) (and not to mention the musicians themselves) played to achieve the final result."
3906,2020-12-15 04:10:25,kddzr3,It has ruined some bands and recordings that were recorded poorly that were favorites before I upgraded. The better equipment revealed the flaws.
3907,2020-12-15 04:46:33,kddzr3,"Not really, made me download FLAC instead of mp3s and searching for recommended pressings and remasters"
3908,2020-12-15 09:08:59,kddzr3,"Much of the music I listen to is built on samples ripped from old vinyl or from analog synths with intentional distortion. There‚Äôs albums I love that were recorded on 4-tracks. Maybe it comes from growing up on hip-hop, electronic and punk rock music...I dunno. I obviously enjoy listening great recordings on my stereo but at the end of the day it‚Äôs always about the music and how it effects me emotionally. My equipment is mid-fi, but I don‚Äôt think upgrading would change my opinion."
3909,2020-12-15 10:06:12,kddzr3,"Before my high-end system I pretty much listened to old music exclusively (from the '30s to the '70s). Now I actually listen to new music, which is nice."
3910,2020-12-15 11:33:48,kddzr3,"Enjoy acoustic music a lot more than I did for this very reason. I also find that music with lots of ""space"" in it - stuff that seems to emerge out of silence and go back to it sounds so good because you can hear subtle harmonics which are totally lost in lower end equipment."
3911,2020-12-15 12:04:43,kddzr3,"I'd never been a Beck fan, really. Never enough to purchase an album at least. But after picking up a few albums at thrifts I'm becoming a fan. They are amazingly well recorded and mastered."
3912,2020-12-15 12:59:25,kddzr3,"I find that I get really context dependent. I love drumming along to pop punk and metal that I grew up to, but when I am sitting down to listen to my speaker setup then I veer away from aggressive and ‚Äúloud‚Äù music to much more open music that emphasises soundstage or imaging and it becomes less a ‚Äúgenre‚Äù and more of a style of mastering/music that spans genres.

In my kitchen, I listen to 1950s pop as I cook and at my work desk I listen to lofi piano chill hop. At my personal desk with my nice headphones I listen to fairly beat heavy music or music which excels in detail, as that‚Äôs what those headphones excel at.

So yes and no? I listen to more types of music now, but I listen to them in specific places on specific equipment."
3913,2020-12-15 15:34:47,kddzr3,"If you change your music then you're listening to your system, not the music. In which case you're an audiophile."
3914,2020-12-15 03:44:10,kddzr3,"I was never into NSync, but ""Bye Bye Bye"" is the most disgusting example I have. Kill me lol"
3915,2020-12-15 03:57:53,kddzr3,"If your system makes you hate music you really love, it might be time to try different equipment. 

Example: I owned a $2200 Mytek Brooklyn DAC+ for a year. It was incredibly good with some music/mastering but made bands like Led Zepplin unlistenable. 

I sold it, bought a Schitt Yggdrasil Analog 2 and found that i enjoyed it with everything."
3916,2020-12-15 15:28:11,kddzr3,"There was a pop song, I can't even remember the name of it, but when ever it came on the radio or anything I loved it. Downloaded the album in FLAC and played it on my ""A gear"", ruined.

There is this weird warble that sounds like a newbie engineer tried to add some reverb or tremolo or something, but just butchered it, and it is so terrible to listen to that I get a feeling that's like the opposite of frission, where my eyes water and I feel the desire to physically cringe.

Cannot listen to that song anywhere but the radio where the terrible effect doesn't come through."
3917,2020-12-15 05:46:02,kddzr3,I have a prime example. I used to enjoy the Mike + the Mechanics album The Living Years a lot. Then I heard it on a proper system and couldn't stand it! I don't know if it's the mix on my particular CD but it sounded so bad! Haven't listened to it since.
3918,2020-12-15 06:13:44,kddzr3,Same
3919,2020-12-15 07:05:05,kddzr3,Maybe your headphones have some flaws that certain music expose
3920,2020-12-15 07:48:18,kddzr3,"For me it it was actually the other way round: I started listening to more and more classical music about three years ago. With that change in musical taste came the change in demand for higher quality playback gear.

Lead me to buying Philips Fidelio X2s as my first good headphone and only about six months later the AKG K812 I still use. Gets powered now by a Mytek Brooklyn DAC+, which before was handling DAC/Preamp business in my stereo, which is currently in storage"
3921,2020-12-15 12:18:57,kddzr3,Love Pink Floyd but Young Lust was never one of my goto's before and now it's one of the first songs I play.
3922,2020-12-15 13:58:58,kddzr3,"I wouldn't say my music taste changed, but some songs were definitely ruined while others turned out to be more awesome, but I generally listen to the same stuff.

Also I agree with the Billie Eilish thing, it's awesome that she doesn't use autotune for such popular artist, and Aurora -who's my favorite singer- is one of her inspirations.

Another thing that has really revealed itself with better gear is nier gestalt\_replicant and automata soundtracks, they're really amazing."
3923,2020-12-15 15:19:25,kddzr3,"I like metal, metal sounds terrible on most systems. Tubes and vintage gear helps somewhat."
3924,2020-12-15 16:17:10,kddzr3,My tastes have broadened as I've gotten older. I haven't stopped liking anything due to my stereo but I have found my self listening to a wider array of genres as my stereo gear has improved.
3925,2020-12-15 16:26:10,kddzr3,"Two of the albums that stuck to me on hifi was Lanterns by Son Lux, and Devils Walk from Apparat. The aound deisgn in the high ends is phenomenal !!"
3926,2020-12-15 17:33:54,kddzr3,"No. I listen to music for the music, not for the mastering."
3927,2020-12-15 19:09:14,kddzr3,"Not really, hi end equipment makes me appreciate music production more, but it doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúunveil‚Äù poor production either. Shitty music doesn‚Äôt sound better or worse on a cheaper system, it just is what it is. I don‚Äôt think Billie Eillish is popular because of her amazing production, but I think she writes catchy music that is appreciated by the masses."
3928,2020-12-16 01:16:21,kddzr3,"Nope, a good song is good in any fidelity and a bad song is always a bad song."
3929,2020-12-16 03:39:15,kddzr3,"Yes.  When i started listening to more high end gear, my music tastes changed from a lot of rap music to more rock music.  I actually liked rock music before, but I found it a lot better because the rock music is just a lot better recorded."
3930,2020-12-15 16:59:13,kddzr3,"I simply found it more rewarding to listen to alot of new music in a search of something I'd like. 90% of music is garbage, so it had been hard for me to try new bands. Good sound has reduced the suffering as sound dimension has become a new source of entertainment. As a result I've found a few nice albums during recent months."
3931,2020-12-15 09:11:45,kddzr3,Not really but then again music over gear is my saying and the best gear is the gear that makes good music sound good. Also is that billie ellish thing a joke? Isnt that more like cerwin vega music or car sub music?
3932,2020-12-15 05:38:22,kddzr3,"Are those headphones tuned to be perceptually neutral? If not, then you're hearing the frequency response of the headphones as an EQ applied to the music."
3933,2020-12-15 11:06:00,kddzr3,"No.

I listen to music to enjoy music, not to listen to my system."
3934,2020-12-15 14:45:54,kddzr3,Shouldn't change your musical tastes because it took a 1k pair of headphones to make it sound good lol
3935,2020-12-15 04:19:20,kddzr3,"Man I dont know. If you have all poorly mastered music then yeah, but if i hear a great mastered song followed by a poorly mastered  one, it feels like two different experiences. Its like going from an imax theatre to instantly watching something on your phone, kinda ruins it for me in the moment and brings me out of the experience."
3936,2020-12-15 04:04:33,kddzr3,"Its definitely okay, but if you get the chance, try them lol. I have my Focals for when I want to do nothing but listen. If I'm wanting to just listen to my old favs and have it in the background, Ive got mid tier cans (but I cant unhear some things sadly)"
3937,2020-12-17 09:18:59,kddzr3,Get a DAC/amp and a pair of sennheiser 58x on Drop.com while set up will cost you $400 and you will never look back
3938,2020-12-15 15:46:45,kddzr3,"same, now i deep dive hdtracks and acousticsounds way too often."
3939,2020-12-15 15:48:17,kddzr3,nsync's POP is an absolute masterpiece. that track was a banger when it came out and is still a hit.
3940,2020-12-15 04:09:12,kddzr3,"No dac has changed a song for me. My experience is that a good $200 dac is no different than a $2000 dac other than bragging rights. I'm with you though, even with the remasters, Zeppelin sounds pretty muddy sometimes"
3941,2020-12-15 15:53:16,kddzr3,[deleted]
3942,2020-12-15 08:59:11,kddzr3,"Nah. Music I don't like could be the best mastered in the world, I'm still not gonna listen to it. I'm here for the tunes. My gear helps deepen that enjoyment. Well mastered music that I love sounds awesome. Poorly mastered music that I love is still great. Music that I don't love is irrelevant. Mastering can't make up for the fact I can't connect to it to begin with"
3943,2020-12-15 18:32:41,kddzr3,"Music brings emotions, sound entertains senses. Metaphoricaly speaking, sound is nice landscapes you see in a window during a trip, and music is a person you travel to."
3944,2020-12-15 04:27:42,kddzr3,"Oh I wouldn't turn that down for sure, but I'm not gonna shell out for high end gear until I do... There are definitely artist that I wish had better backing and gear because I like the music but there are a few that I don't really like as much but I can tell even on my lower end gear, or as a dj I find I will play sometimes tracks that I would have rather traded out for something else but it's better sound quality. I'm mostly into electronic music, and I'm very curious to hear some of my favorites on high end gear, and see what that is like. If you are feeling froggy, check out ""electrypnose - the hard part"" or anything off of his ""technopera"" album, I suspect it will hold up well on a good system, sounds great on a well tuned pa system for sure... And it would probably be the first tune I tried out. Also ""erkiu and maurus - first breath"" or anything by juno reactor... I suspect though that a lot of the hifi world is really focused on re-creating the effect that you are listening to a live band or orchestra, and I almost never do that, because I like the idea of creating a sterio field that is surreal or bigger than the space you are in... I'd like to hear an epic space battle an feel like I could tell where all the ships firing at each other are... I don't want to be hearing a live band in my living room, I want to be peering into an alternate dimension. A ""band"" I know is going to be very high production value though and is the most popular in my music circle but not nessesarily my thing is probably going to be Infected Mushroom, my favorite album of theirs is probably ""B.P. empire"" though I'd suspect their more recent stuff is better quality as they got more famous and have a ton of more money these days, I'd probably listen to the album ""return to the sauce"" but if you do happen to listen to any of this stuff and happen to want to give a more critical review based around the quality of the production and vs midrange gear, I'd love to hear what you think"
3945,2020-12-15 04:10:11,kddzr3,@ChrisMag999 what headphones do you use?
3946,2020-12-15 16:02:47,kddzr3,Softens the sound...so yes?
3947,2020-12-15 04:50:07,kddzr3,"I have a set of Sennheiser headphones but mainly, I listen though Focal Sopra 2 speakers, fed by a Parasound JC2 BP pre / JC5 amp combo. 

Digital source is a Roon Nucleus, Ethernet to an Oppo 203 as the endpoint. Files are local FLAC rips from my CD collection and also Qobuz."
3948,2020-12-15 04:05:26,kdcogz,"I'm assuming you are talking about removable diegetic audio.  That is to prevent people from stealing it from YouTube and buy the song.  It's basically a watermark.

Your opinion is akin to saying, ""Pictures with watermarks automatically ruins the picture.""  Yeah, that's what it is supposed to do to incentivize you to buy the song.

Unless it is actually part of the song, in which case what the hell is the artist thinking."
3949,2020-12-15 16:04:05,kdcogz,Just listen to the audio version of the song on YouTube.
3950,2020-12-15 13:41:37,kdcogz,"Except for ""Fatty Boom Boom."" That shit was priceless."

3954,2020-12-15 17:55:45,kdcogz,I think he is talking about music videos where they add a portion that wouldn't be in the single if you just bought it. Like they cut out of the song after the first chorus and instead of going into the second verse it has characters talking instead of just singing the song as it was.
3955,2020-12-15 17:45:39,kdcogz,I dont think he's talking about that
3956,2020-12-15 12:14:29,kdcogz,"That song was on one of the Rock Band games and a friend of mine did that section of the song - loudly - on the demo machine at GameStop.

No one can figure out why. Once he was in front of Sam Smith, once in front of Avril Lavigne. When I look at it, he is before Selena Gomez. You'll have to ask Google :) 

 I just think Google is simping for Joel."

3971,2020-12-15 05:03:50,kd9vsn,There was a time when I definitely found conspiracy theories really fun and interesting. I'm okay with he Mandela effect conspiracies and alien conspiracies because they can be fun to read about. However I think there is a line where they can become dangerous and I feel like that line has been crossed with nutjobs like Alex Jones spewing their bullshit to the world. I'm not saying Kat has specifically crossed this line but I am saying to just be careful with what you see or read. Conspiracy theories are why people like Cody and Danielle Murphy think the way the do.
3972,2020-12-15 00:21:25,kd9vsn,She was like this on the show so it shouldn't be much of a surprise.
3973,2020-12-15 00:27:07,kd9vsn,The botox paralyzed her brain
3974,2020-12-15 00:36:58,kd9vsn,I'm here blew that y'all follow these people pass their respective season.
3975,2020-12-15 09:59:58,kd9vsn,I thought she hated anything to do with conspiring ;) or maybe just when they're conspiring against her
3976,2020-12-15 21:29:31,kd9vsn,I want her to come back for anything other than conspiracies.
3977,2020-12-15 19:18:00,kd9vsn,Kat replied. Conspiracy confirmed.
3978,2020-12-15 02:46:14,kd9vsn,Yeah
3979,2020-12-15 02:50:53,kd9vsn,"> there‚Äôs a reason she calls them a conspiracy

That doesn't mean she doesn't believe it! At one point she called something a conspiracy ""fact"" instead of a ""theory."""
3980,2020-12-16 00:46:43,kd9vsn,She has a following(people that idoloze her) so she needs to be careful and not go out too far
3981,2020-12-15 00:39:27,kd9vsn,I didn't watch her on the feeds and the show didn't portray it as crazy as this!
3982,2020-12-15 01:11:53,kd9vsn,"The podcast is hosted by Morgan (my flair), Kaitlyn, and one of their friends Amanda. It's been around for a bit now and they don't really talk reality very much."
3983,2020-12-15 02:59:23,kd9vsn,"Why? Some of them are just fun to follow, like Jun, Matt Hoffman, Daniele Reyes, Rockstar, off the top of my head. These are people i would very likely follow even if they'd never been on Big Brother."
3984,2020-12-15 00:47:13,kd9vsn,"Yeah I didn't watch feeds that season either, but they did definitely touch on her conspiracy theory side on the show. I definitely think conspiracy theories are dumb but as long as she isn't hurting anyone then go ahead I guess, lol."

If anything what was surprising were the song choices by certain artists. Two Door - Sun? It's good. Surprised it's someone's favorite when the rest of their discog exists. Foster - Pay the Man? That was the song that like... first made me think they stopped giving a shit. Always so strange to me when people can listen to the same things and take such drastically different things away from them.

If your song is not in here I probably already knew it or still liked it, but it wasn't my favourite. These are the songs (and I probably still missed some) that I put in one of my personal playlists :)."
4090,2020-12-30 19:30:26,kn4nt1,But if I have to choose one favourite out of all of them I will choose The Great Escape - Seventh Wonder. Special thanks to the two people who mentioned that song. It's something special :o
4091,2020-12-30 17:17:23,kn4nt1,Old Godzilla was hopping around
4092,2020-12-30 17:12:22,kn4nt1,"was thinking the same thing, if his mouth albums were on spotify I'd understand it more, but it's definitely cool to see him on the list... I'm just glad I got Primus on there >:3"
4093,2021-01-02 13:11:11,kn4nt1,"To be fair, out of all the Lemon Demon songs I am completely unsurprised it was touch tone telephone, people love that song."
4094,2020-12-30 18:15:51,kn4nt1,"Yeah, I don't think Johnny Cash even comes close to the pure talent of Cardi B either, but hey, he's also pretty good :)"
4095,2020-12-30 18:27:29,kn4nt1,I put the PVRIS one but I was so excited to see all the IDKHOW and Bastille ones!
4096,2020-12-30 19:19:47,kn4nt1,Glad you appreciated turn
4097,2020-12-30 19:13:38,kn4nt1,I want to know who else voted for Shine on You Crazy Diamond because you have excellent taste in music.
4098,2020-12-31 00:42:25,kn4nt1,"Hi yes, Great Gig here <3"
4099,2020-12-30 18:11:19,kn4nt1,It was my pleasure <3
4100,2020-12-30 18:19:57,kn4nt1,"I liked that one too, and I hadn't heard it before :). I had only heard of 'choke' by them."
4101,2020-12-30 19:59:44,kn4nt1,"I don't know, I just followed orders ;)"
4102,2020-12-31 01:54:00,kn4nt1,"same here, they're a true one"
4103,2020-12-30 17:03:50,kn4nt1,I'm glad you like it!
4104,2020-12-30 17:39:40,kn4nt1,Nice to see your taste is represented :D. My dad was also happy some of his favorite songs were on here :p.
4105,2020-12-30 17:56:57,kn4nt1,That was mine! They‚Äôre my favorite band
4106,2020-12-30 17:57:17,kn4nt1,What lyric do you have
4107,2020-12-30 19:13:51,kn4nt1,It‚Äôs Called: Freefall is one of my favorite songs right now.
4108,2020-12-30 19:17:02,kn4nt1,"RKS is so phenomenal! I‚Äôve seen them three times now, twice by myself even. To anyone else reading this, when things return to a new normal please do yourself a favor and check out a live show. The energy is insane."
4109,2020-12-30 18:25:07,kn4nt1,"Yes, I listened to it :) and I was doubting to put the version that's on spotify on the list, but since you specifically mentioned that it wasn't on Spotify I decided to not put it in at all. That version doesn't compare to Bon Iver's tbf..."
4110,2020-12-30 17:38:06,kn4nt1,Which one do you suggest? \^\^ I will gladly do that :p
4111,2021-01-02 04:15:39,kn4nt1,"This was a good one, best Tool song imo and I was really happy to see it!"
4112,2020-12-30 19:12:07,kn4nt1,I added FM-84. I absolutely love that song. Not gonna lie.
4113,2020-12-31 00:36:05,kn4nt1,"Tbh I wouldn't have guessed Cry for Judas or Damn These Vampires would make the cut, but I'm glad they did because they're two of my favorites too"
4114,2020-12-30 21:30:20,kn4nt1,haha you might want to warn the neighbours :O
4115,2020-12-31 09:45:50,kn4nt1,Oh that's interesting!
4116,2020-12-30 18:02:58,kn4nt1,<3
4117,2020-12-30 19:25:13,kn4nt1,I'm glad to hear that. Same here :D
4118,2020-12-30 19:32:42,kn4nt1,"Yes that's true :), and Metallica was already represented with two songs and Stone Sour wasn't so you made a great choice :D."
4119,2020-12-30 19:31:32,kn4nt1,Nice to hear you say that <3.
4120,2020-12-30 19:51:00,kn4nt1,"When I saw your submission I was like: Where do I know this name from? Turns out it's from a remix of Bellyache ^^. Do you hate me now? haha. And yes I agree, almost everyone probably has a story on why they picked their song..."
4121,2020-12-30 19:59:01,kn4nt1,Big shoutout to the two of you! Someone asked me my favourite song of the bunch and I chose this one. I had never heard it before and it just hit me so hard :D.
4122,2020-12-31 16:46:05,kn4nt1,Haha you sound like me going through this list... I was so surprised by the variety in that song. I already mentioned it as my favourite of the songs that I didn't know yet :).
4123,2020-12-30 17:42:30,kn4nt1,"I don't haha. Someone actually voted for the 'claire version' of Fly me to the Moon, but since it wasn't on Spotify I decided that putting in the original was the second best thing :)"
4124,2020-12-30 17:43:16,kn4nt1,[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDFimNi5o8M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDFimNi5o8M) The singing is great btw \^\^
4125,2020-12-30 21:32:01,kn4nt1,"Yes I think you're right, there where only a couple of electronic songs... Thank you for participating :D"
4126,2020-12-30 21:42:36,kn4nt1,"I have to admit that it's hard to tell for me since I'm not into musicals at all. Someone submitted Show Yourself from Frozen which is not really a musical I guess. And then there was F√©ny√©v t√°vols√°g (A padl√°s) by Feke P√°l, which I assume was from you ;). I think that was all :p."
4127,2020-12-30 22:02:42,kn4nt1,Someone just sent me a link to a song I couldn't find and it's another musical song. Look at the bottom of the playlist ;).
4128,2020-12-31 01:22:59,kn4nt1,"I just had heard one called Santa Fe, definitely seems like a musical song, kinda campy lol"
4129,2020-12-30 22:05:04,kn4nt1,It is called 'Favourite Songs of Reddit' and if you can't find that. Look up the user 'ikbeneenkaars' (me). This way you will find the playlist as well :)
4130,2020-12-31 04:02:34,kn4nt1,Queen.
4131,2020-12-31 09:38:13,kn4nt1,"I'm not sure but Pink Floyd, The Beatles seem to appear the most, followed by Queen."
4132,2020-12-30 21:45:14,kn4nt1,I'm glad to hear that :)
4133,2020-12-31 09:40:57,kn4nt1,"Yessss, they're respresented quite well :)"
4134,2020-12-30 22:55:41,kn4nt1,Yes I put in the Girl from Ipanema by Stan Getz
4135,2021-01-01 18:56:16,kn4nt1,"Haha, the variety is nice though :D."
4136,2021-01-02 11:05:26,kn4nt1,I am now after hearing that genius piece of music haha. Obsessed :p
4137,2021-01-02 11:04:29,kn4nt1,Yeah it's an interesting song :)
4138,2020-12-30 18:47:15,kn4nt1,I don't know why I was surprised to see Rick Astley on this list
4139,2020-12-31 01:49:53,kn4nt1,"I don't know why, but it low key made my day that you took at least special note of my song! (I posted Ark as a big Sound Horizon fan) Thanks for doing this whole thing, and I can't wait to check out what people like, especially the ones you liked, as someone who's always hunting for new music and artists to get into!"
4140,2020-12-30 21:20:00,kn4nt1,"I took the time to look at the playlist and boi am I hyped to listen to it now! So much amazing stuff in there and I can't wait to listen to the songs I don't know yet. :D

I'm glad you like Deja Vu from DREAMCATCHER. Wasn't my suggestion but I've been listening to their music a lot the last few days and it's kind of nice to see them on the list.

Also seeing RAMMSTEIN in there made me think that it might be fun to have a playlist with everyone's favorite song in their native language. Would 100% listen to that! :D"
4141,2021-01-01 20:36:01,kn4nt1,"Ah, thought you meant this song. Love this song. (Escape...)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WsIHCV1SDs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WsIHCV1SDs)  
Blind Melon - No Rain"
4142,2021-01-02 18:04:45,kn4nt1,It actually wasn't one I was familiar with! I listened and really liked it though :)
4143,2020-12-30 19:17:15,kn4nt1,"You joke, but blasphemy! :P"
4144,2020-12-30 20:32:51,kn4nt1,"I was the 2nd person :-) were you the first?

We should have had both parts rather than just one"
4145,2020-12-31 19:26:09,kn4nt1,"I've been listening to the playlist and it makes me kind of emotional thinking about how every one is someone's favorite song that moves them in some way, and they eagerly shared it to be put on this playlist so that I could listen and experience their favorite song too. It makes me want to pay really close attention and really appreciate every single one. <3

Even the Rick Roll. lol"
4146,2020-12-30 18:30:33,kn4nt1,"Choke is awesome too, I personally like it more than Do It All The Time, but I like both :)"
4147,2020-12-30 18:26:59,kn4nt1,"That‚Äôs awesome. I‚Äôm probably never gonna actually listen to this playlist since I mostly use Apple Music, but I still have it saved just in case. There‚Äôs some absolute bangers."
4148,2020-12-30 18:25:47,kn4nt1,They‚Äôre mine too! I had meet and greet tickets for one of their shows in May but obviously that didn‚Äôt happen (thanks COVID). It would have been my third time seeing them live. Have you seen them live before?
4149,2020-12-30 18:25:07,kn4nt1,"‚ÄúThe quiet die young‚Äù cuz I‚Äôve always been told I‚Äôm too loud and that I talk too much (thanks ADHD) and that my voice is annoying. So that line in that context hits hard. 

My tattoo reminds me that I have my voice for a reason, ya know? My words matter sometimes. I gotta use them."
4150,2020-12-30 23:42:53,kn4nt1,"Absolutely insane energy. I‚Äôve seen them twice (once by myself and it was *sick*). I was gonna see them a third time last may‚ÄîI even had meet and greet tickets! But obviously that didn‚Äôt happen. 

At one of the shows, Charlie‚Äôs shoe came untied so Sam knelt down to tie it and Charlie whispered into the mic ‚Äúmy best friend is better than yours‚Äù and I think about that all the fucking time"
4151,2020-12-30 18:05:50,kn4nt1,r/spotify for one
4152,2020-12-30 19:38:31,kn4nt1,A man of quality
4153,2020-12-30 21:31:09,kn4nt1,We have a limit on gatherings of 5 people and they've invited us over ;)
4154,2020-12-31 09:47:17,kn4nt1,Great to hear you enjoyed it!
4155,2020-12-30 21:44:05,kn4nt1,"Actually I think I submitted Who Would I Be from Falsettos, I can‚Äôt actually remember lol. I‚Äôll have a look"
4156,2020-12-30 22:03:03,kn4nt1,I will :)
4157,2020-12-31 01:24:09,kn4nt1,it is from a musical it‚Äôs from newsies i love newsies and i love jeremy jordan
4158,2020-12-30 22:55:59,kn4nt1,Thanks
4159,2020-12-30 18:52:17,kn4nt1,I was more surprised to see it only once :p
4160,2020-12-31 09:44:43,kn4nt1,"I'm grateful that you selected that song. I had never heard of it and it sounds sooo good. It instantly made me think of this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Av04XfLtAcU
Edit: Now that I listen to both again, the beginnings are very similar right? haha"
4161,2020-12-30 21:28:53,kn4nt1,"I'm glad you like it! That sounds like a very fun idea! If I have your permission, I might steal that :D. Do you think that people from the US and UK should also be able to vote in that? :p"
4162,2020-12-30 19:33:09,kn4nt1,\^\^  I know
4163,2020-12-30 23:13:55,kn4nt1,"I don't know who voted first but the first part is probably my fault. I knew OP was going to Spotify so I chose Pts 1-5 because if I can only have one, I want that one. 

I wonder if we can get the other half added?"
4164,2020-12-31 19:30:58,kn4nt1,Haha so nice :D. I guess I can say quite confidently that that wasn't submitted with a very deep backstory ;).
4165,2020-12-30 18:29:11,kn4nt1,For sure!
4166,2020-12-30 18:52:52,kn4nt1,Aw that‚Äôs amazing. I was supposed to see them for the first time in July but my bff COVID came along to stop that
4167,2020-12-30 18:53:23,kn4nt1,Oh that‚Äôs beautiful. I‚Äôve never paid much attention to that lyric but now I really appreciate it
4168,2020-12-30 18:17:33,kn4nt1,"Maybe you could crosspost it there if you'd like? Or maybe teach me how to crosspost :P, I'm a bit of a dummy."
4169,2020-12-30 21:44:16,kn4nt1,"Owhh, that sounds very nice! I hope they appreciate it :D"
4170,2020-12-30 21:49:25,kn4nt1,"Heyy, that could be true, because I'm looking it up on Spotify now and i can't find it :/. So if you can find it you can send me a link :), or you can tell me which song you'd like to be in instead :D."
4171,2021-01-01 23:49:04,kn4nt1,Wait it was only once. I wonder who it could be.
4172,2020-12-31 18:26:11,kn4nt1,"Yeah, they really are surprisingly similar beginnings! If you like Ark, then I think you would probably like the rest of Sound Horizon's work, but I'll stop my incoming shill rant there haha! I listened to the playlist a bit last night, including a bunch of the ones you liked and damn, this is a really good list so far, I'm impressed!

I only got down to ""Favorite Liar"" in your list and so far really liked ""Cirice"" ""Judas"" ""The Wreck of Edmund Fitzgerald"" ""Deja Vu"" ""The Culling of the Fold"" ""All I Need"" and ""Anesthetize""! I've also seen a few good ones I recognize in the list, but mostly stuff I've never heard of or thought to check out, but considering I liked just about everything I heard to some extent, I look forward to finding more favorites!"
4173,2020-12-30 21:41:31,kn4nt1,"Oh yes, please! Of course you have my permission! Can't wait for that playlist! :D

I think everyone should be able to vote. 
However, maybe you could create two playlists. One that has every song in it and one that's only the non english songs. How does that sound? :]"
4174,2020-12-30 23:48:00,kn4nt1,It‚Äôs crazy how that lyric is the one that stands out the most to me is one that is most overlooked to you. I love that. It just shows all the different meanings we can pull from their music
4175,2020-12-30 18:29:49,kn4nt1,"Click the three dots in the top right of the post, and then simply select ""Crosspost to a community""!"
4176,2020-12-30 21:53:40,kn4nt1,"It might not have been that because I have a lot of favourite songs but sure I‚Äôll send you the link, currently it‚Äôs actually one day more so here‚Äôs the link: https://open.spotify.com/track/11goMPj3f6e93pDPIlWR2Y?si=s5v3LywzRqKubk1F4FOH_g

I thought I would have picked what would I do because it makes me cry every time without fail but it might have been one day more or wait for me from hadestown or anything really"
4177,2020-12-31 18:35:55,kn4nt1,"It's really awesome to hear that so many people are discovering new music because of the playlist :). I will definitely check out more of Sound Horizon, because I love this style of music :D."
4178,2020-12-30 21:46:24,kn4nt1,"Sounds pretty good :D, but I still think that english songs would be overrepresented and that it would therefore be similar to this list..."
4179,2020-12-31 01:17:29,kn4nt1,I love Painkillers so much though
4180,2020-12-30 18:33:59,kn4nt1,Thank you! I will
4181,2020-12-30 21:58:24,kn4nt1,"You might be right. Maybe the non english playlist would come out short but do you think it's still worth a shot? I would certainly enjoy it (I'm a little bit of a language nerd [not talented tho]).

I don't know. It's kind of hard to tell how many people on here aren't native english speakers because, well... everyone's speaking English. I think there could be a lot of interesting stuff if enough people participate though."
4182,2020-12-30 22:03:39,kn4nt1,Yeah I think you're right. Thanks for the idea :D.
4183,2020-12-30 22:06:19,kn4nt1,"My pleasure!

Looks like I'll need to figure out which one my favorite German song is now. :D"
4184,2020-12-30 22:09:07,kn4nt1,"Yes do that :p, would be Rammstein - Engel for me ;) (although I'm not German)."
4185,2020-12-30 15:32:47,kn45wz,I don‚Äôt see how she‚Äôs stupid. You‚Äôre probably someone who doesn‚Äôt appreciate her music or self expression in her appearance so you dislike her for that.
4186,2020-12-30 16:08:45,kn45wz,The amount of hate she gets for really no reason bothers me. So she‚Äôs got an intentional awkward style and two tone hair? So she doesn‚Äôt do glam? Who cares!?! I‚Äôm an old man so I don‚Äôt listen to her music but when I hear it I do appreciate that she sings very quietly. Pop music has been shouting for 60 years now. Give her a break or just ignore her if you don‚Äôt like her stuff.
4187,2020-12-30 17:08:54,kn45wz,"Got your attention though, didn't she!"
4188,2020-12-30 17:51:12,kn45wz,*you type as tears and snot roll down off your face and onto the keyboard*
4189,2020-12-30 15:51:07,kn45wz,"Well who really cares about her as a person that isn‚Äôt close to her? I mean, she should only be viewed for her music and not looked up on as a person anyways"
4190,2020-12-30 15:27:38,kn45wz,"I‚Äôve got no idea if she‚Äôs a stupid person, but I‚Äôm surprised how popular she is based on the product she puts out. I‚Äôm also super annoyed with how she has inspired my teenage daughter to dress like an absolute slob."
4191,2020-12-30 15:54:08,kn45wz,Idc about music but she's hypocrite.
4192,2020-12-30 15:51:07,kn45wz,Her lyrics seem too overtly kinkily sexual for public consumption too. I heard my 13 year old niece singing along to one of songs and it felt so inappropriate

4219,2020-12-30 10:55:23,kmytmf,"It's possible since music is more fragmented than it was 10 years ago, which is a trend that's likely to continue for the reason that it serves the consumer by allowing them to pursue their own tastes more.

I don't think the music megastar will vanish completely, though. What it really comes down to is what we even mean by the idea of fame. In my opinion, what separates the music megastar from the ""ordinary"" famous musician is that their fame *transcends* music. For example, the artists you mentioned in your first paragraph have enormous fame even with people who have *never heard their music* - and you might be surprised by how many people this is. That fame comes because they have broken into the mainstream media and news cycle. Yes, their music was/is extremely popular, but their megastar status wasn't ordained by music listeners. Instead it was ordained by the media (then controlled by mainstream outlets, now more so driven by social media) that accepted them into a world of general celebrity which is ""more global"" than music culture.

In conclusion, the reason why I don't think megastars will disappear is that media (whether traditional or social media) will always be looking to crown a new celebrity whether or not the music itself has been heard by as many people - and ultimately it is media that decides who the celebrity will be, not music listeners.

EDIT: what has also changed, arguably, is that - like music culture - mainstream media culture is also more fragmented and driven by diverse social media rather than uniform entertainment journalism outlets. If there are fewer new music megastars now than there was in the past, it may be because social media can't agree who they should be."
4220,2020-12-30 09:51:31,kmytmf,"Yes but also no. While people's music taste is definitely more eclectic on average these days which is going to lead to more niche artists rising to a moderate level of fame, I see no reason to believe that with the truly massive artists of today like Drake, Billie, Travis Scott, The Weeknd, BTS, Ariana being as huge as they are that there's any sign of the superstar slowing down."
4221,2020-12-31 02:55:29,kmytmf,"I think it depends on what we are considering stardom. No one is really standing out to me as say a Madonna, Janet, Mariah, or a Michael. Rihanna was on track but took a detour into the fashion industry. Beyonce is Beyonce. But when I think of even a Katy Perry or Ed Sheeran...Hell, even a Grande or BTS, something is missing. Where is that staying power. They may last a few years, then fade. Where is that extra oomf at? Even Justin Beiber has practically faded. Some have definitely emerged (Taylor Swift) but music is always an ebb and flow. Especially in my millennial generation."
4222,2020-12-30 13:39:00,kmytmf,"With the continued evolution of how we consume music, along with the prosperity of social media, it‚Äôs now even easier for young (career-wise) artists to expand their fan base, thus increasing music discovery without a radio personality telling us what to listen to."
4223,2020-12-30 12:43:02,kmytmf,"I don't really believe this. People have been making posts like this on the internet for 20 years (usually alongside posts about how albums about about to die any second). These things always seem clearer in retrospect so 10/20 years from now you'll be able to pinpoint who the biggest stars of the era were much like you have with the early 2000's

>Whereas now I feel music is far more fragmented.

Admittedly I'm older than some here at 44, but I really don't get this sense at all. If this sub is in any way representative of how younger people view music then you're just wrong. I see far more young people here (teens to early 20's) focussing on what the biggest artist of the day is than I ever saw as a young person. Nobody really gave a shit about top 40/Mainstream music back when I was a teen and noting ""the biggest current thing"" seems far more prevalent now than I remember it ever being as a kid."
4224,2020-12-31 02:34:06,kmytmf,"I've always wondered this. As a metal/rock fan, it seems like every ""festival"" has the same bands every year. I live in Wisconsin and there's like 3 outdoor music festivals every year. It's always the same handful of bands. Bush, Papa Roach, Rob Zombie, Marilyn Manson Five Finger Death Punch and a few others. Once in a while they'll have Slipknot or something but it really seems to be the same few bands. And it's not just in Wisconsin it's everywhere. Metal artists for years have questioned who the next festival headliners are gonna be."
4225,2021-01-01 20:32:50,kmytmf,"We live in the era of specialised niches, short attention spamn, wealth of content, algorithm based targeted advertising and increasingly segragated societies. Superstars like Freddie Mercury, Jackson or The Beatles will likely never happen in our lifetimes. Passing fads like Sheeran and Del Rey sure, since marketing needs recognisable faces to brand products. Regional heroes or underground/cult icons, sure it happens. 

It is a wider societal issue.

As for the ones you mention (Eminem, Rihana etc.), no one having lived them in their heyday really cares about them. Mercury sold out movie theaters worldwide while being 6 ft under for 30 years based on name recognition alone. The Beatles and Zeppelin are still selling out re-issues of their past work and are deified in pop-culture for ever. There is no comparisson."
4226,2020-12-30 18:52:58,kmytmf,"Billie Elish, Dua Lips and Halsey. There I just listed three massive artists who broke through in the last few years. The myth that ""fame doesn't exist anymore"" is simply not true.

I think the argument comes from people who are not really as in touch with new music as they'd like to think they are. The argument makes sense too: without MTV or radio's dominance you would expect the mainstream artists to not have the popularity they oncehad, but for whatever reason this proved false. 

I listed only three artists at the start but while writing this post I kept coming up with more and more artists I could include, which I feel just proves my point."
4227,2021-01-03 10:59:07,kmytmf,"Kind of, but just as a natural consequence of streaming services being a thing. Anyone can listen to just about anything at any given time, and it's a lot easier for someone to make music and just release it with no further steps than making, uploading, and maybe advertising themselves. Before it was a lot more centered around the radio and what big companies were promoting the hardest. That middleman can now be totally fixed, so you can better curate what you listen to to your own tastes, being able to look for new music whenever at no financial risk, since it costs nothing extra to go to an artist's page you've never heard before and listen to their stuff, whereas you used to actually have to sink money into buying a record."
4228,2020-12-30 17:17:37,kmytmf,"Thought provoking question. As I look back, I think these things go in cycles.

4229,2020-12-30 18:39:50,kmytmf,"> And there are too many 'moderately famous ' artists 

You say it as if it was a bad thing. 

Rather than having a few artists who dominate the scene whose music is written and produced by the same people it is better for music consumers to have a wider palette of moderately popular artists to chose from. Perhaps people got bored with the samey music in the 2000's mainstream and tried to find artists closer to their tastes.

And as for music awards, why do they even matter? Does a pile of metal make a piece of music better?"
4230,2020-12-31 06:30:18,kmytmf,"A good thing for the listeners because they'll be able to find a niche for their taste in music more easily and they'd be able to ignore the things they don't like more easily as well.

A bad thing for the artist because they will have less presence on people's minds and they may not be able to earn profits with their work, at least not as well."

That makes so much sense. Yeah I guess you're right. I just have felt over the past few years there isn't the same crop of people like there were in early 2000's (eminem, rihanna etc). So maybe the media has been 'failing' to crown anybody a celebrity? Maybe haha I don't know

>truly massive artists of today like Drake, Billie, Travis Scott, The Weeknd, BTS, Ariana being as huge as they are that there's any sign of the superstar slowing down.

I agree, they probably wont slow down but I guess I am arguing that there wont be any 'new' ones in the future because all these examples are at least a couple of years old and there seems to be fewer and fewer truly 'global' superstars coming out every year. 

Don't know, just my opinion"
4234,2020-12-30 14:56:43,kmytmf,"Agreed, which is why I feel that more and more people can get moderate levels of fame and success rather than fewer with superstar levels of fame and success.

It has evened out the playing field and more people can be successful but since there is so much more competition (and less money in record labels) there are fewer 'superstars'. Most of the ones you think of became superstars years ago rather than any recent ones. 

Strictly my opinion"
4235,2020-12-30 18:23:14,kmytmf,"Coming in about 5 years older than you, and generally agree with your sentiments with a couple of exceptions that I think stem from the age difference. Generally speaking, my peers and I who became adults in the late 1980s were more into the Top 40 of that day. We'd also see that contrary camp that said Top 40 sucked and would go out of their way to be Alternative (Smiths, Depeche Mode, Siouxsie and the Banshees, etc).  I was that kid who sorta listened to everything, including Zeppelin, Rush, Elvis Costello, and even my ""Dad's music"" like the Doors, Beatles, etc.

Now the reason I say that 5 years between us makes a difference is that the whole grunge  and alternative thing just passed right by me and the folks in my social circle of the early 90s."
4236,2020-12-30 20:53:23,kmytmf,"I‚Äôm the same age as you and I think the reason we didn‚Äôt care so much about the top 40 when we were teens is because a lot of that music wasn‚Äôt made for teens. Did *you* know anyone in high school who listened to Michael Bolton or Celine Dion? Because I sure as hell did not, that was for old people. Even early Mariah Carey came across a bit stuffy, and she was an actual young person! Meanwhile Nirvana only had two top 40 US hits, but they were extremely relevant to our age group. Nowadays the music that hits the top 40 is mostly relevant to teenagers, so they‚Äôre more likely to care than we did."

That's interesting that you consider Sheeran a passing fad! What differs him as a fad to (say) a superstar? Would you consider Taylor/Eminem/Rihanna fads or superstars?

>That middleman can now be totally fixed

What do you mean by that?

But yeah, I think streaming services have paved the way for so many more artists to have exposure and as such the market is more saturated so it's harder to stand out and reach that 'superstar' status. Which is a good and bad thing I guess"
4241,2020-12-30 17:31:48,kmytmf,"Hahah thanks! Thats a very nice thing to say.

Thats an interesting insight! I never realised elite superstars/fragmentation was also a cyclic thing! So would you say you've observed this cycle before, where there was a period of fragmented musicians before the big names (such as Eminem/Rihanna/Taylor etc)?"

You're right, I edited it, thanks for pointing that out.

Yeah I completely agree, that makes sense as a reason why music is more fragmented 

>And as for music awards, why do they even matter? Does a pile of metal make a piece of music better?

Nah, that wasnt my point. I am not saying they matter, I just meant in the past it was easy to tell who the superstars were because you could see who they were at award shows whereas now there are so many that award shows don't have the select few 'superstars'"
4243,2020-12-31 07:29:04,kmytmf,I think not having a dominating force in the scene would actually allow for more musicians/producers and related workers to make a living of it.
4244,2020-12-31 15:58:36,kmytmf,Agreed

I think if you went back to when these people were first getting famous (i.e. in the last 2-5 years, for most of them), you'd have argued that they weren't superstars. It takes a few years to build up to that level. There probably will be new superstars five years from now, and some of them are probably names you already know but just don't consider to be superstars yet."

Some points:

1 - Jack √ú stems were leaked in March and inside the folders they had instruments wav, we only had the instruments mp3 320, I think few people noticed that.

2 - I put the track ""On Ice"", leaked in 2018, but that this sub got to know that Skrillex worked on it this year, I believe that some people didn‚Äôt get it, so I put it in the folder.

3 - In March of this year, Skrillex sets were leaked in 2014 in high quality, the Levels VIP + Cinema that Skrillex played in these sets was a little different from the versions leaked in 2016. Then, they cleaned up the audio and posted the two versions of these tracks. Enjoy! SKRILLEX SETS LEAK: https://drive.google.com/drive/mobile/folders/1RaTNlosfOHjVcX_8aC6cGS1n2MP_ehfg

4 - Ego Death and Temptations were leaked at the beginning of the year and are slightly different from the released versions, basically a Pre-release.

I want to thank all the people who leaked these songs, it was a year that everyone was waiting for the release of the album, but that didn't happen, taking these tracks made me a little happier.

Obs: If you want to download all the tracks at once, the last link is a RAR with all the tracks inside."

4286,2020-12-30 05:13:30,kmtxe3,"I mean this year was full of leaks, but I understand Skrill fans (like me) want more VIP's & demos that were forgotten from 2009-2016 instead of very early Jack U demos & unfinished Pop Collabs"
4287,2020-12-30 09:46:04,kmtxe3,üòâ
4288,2020-12-30 10:59:27,kmtxe3,nah all good just curious

4291,2020-12-30 05:14:50,kmtxe3,"I don't mind about Jack U Stuff, but i feel like this year was kind of empty..."
4292,2021-01-01 23:35:04,kmtxe3,I just want Shark Patrol to finally leak
4293,2020-12-30 05:17:36,kmtxe3,"I don't mind them really, in fact I actually like them. but these are just early pop roduction collabs not something as updated Amplifire, El Cuco or Beats Knockin' VIP."
4294,2021-01-01 23:39:26,kmtxe3,"Man, i just forgot about that track's existance lol, i gotta hear it again"
4295,2020-12-30 05:25:11,kmtxe3,"Man, ""On A Fukn Plane"" was surprising because almost nobody knew that the track exists because it was never played live, i think that this track was the most unexpected leak because of how old is the track."
