> Related projects: Scott Bradlee and Saturday Morning Slow Jams

> Scott Bradlee has long had a love/hate relationship with pop music.

> Growing up as an aspiring jazz pianist, Scott was not interested in listening to anything that might appeal to those that he deemed to possess a less than refined palette of musical taste. This willful ignorance continued for some time; it was not until he began making YouTube videos (and subsequently receiving requests for modern pop songs) that Scott decided to drop his preconceived notions and examine contemporary pop with an open mind.

> What he found is that, despite his initial aversion to the stuff Scott was hearing, he was unable to truly categorize this as ‚Äúbad music‚Äù without first defining a set of arbitrary, culturally-defined criteria. Furthermore, the fact that such a rigorous vetting process exists for the output of major labels indicated that these songs and artists certainly RESONATED with the culture of our times‚Äìno easy feat, in and of itself. As a relentless devil‚Äôs advocate, Scott then found that by simply altering the context of such songs,  he could find quite a bit of artistic merit inside of them.

> His goal with Postmodern Jukebox is to get his audience to think of songs not as rigid, ephemeral objects, but like malleable globs of silly putty. Songs can be twisted, shaped, and altered without losing their identities‚Äìjust as we grow, age, and expire without losing ours‚Äìand it is through this exploration that the gap between ‚Äúhigh‚Äù and ‚Äúlow‚Äù art can be bridged most readily.

> He wants to contribute to the pop music lexicon in the best way that he can.

> He wants to encourage others to push the boundaries of genres, and give them the tools to do so.

> He wants to create an alternate universe of popular song. Read more on Last.fm.

49,2020-02-04 11:47:31,eymn7m,"Considering Wayne applied for both the Naval Academy as a teenager and the oss during ww2, I don‚Äôt think he had any issue serving his country. He also tried to enlist during ww2"

54,2020-02-04 08:37:35,eymn7m,"lol I doubt that anyone still thinks that the cringe cowboy shit is not embarrassingly stupid in hindsight, but thanks for speaking it out loudly. :-)"
55,2020-02-04 07:54:41,eymn7m,Do people actually know who any of those people are? The only name I recognised here was Miley Cyrus.
56,2020-02-04 11:45:17,eymn7m,Yes.
57,2020-02-04 11:50:20,eymn7m,"And yet while men like my grandfather were fighting John Wayne made movies. He could have fought.

It just bugged me he made a bunch of cowboy movies where he killed Native American and Mexicans as if they were always the villains.

I know it's fake but it helped shaped ideas about the west for people who never even got on a horse. 

I bet during Vietnam he licked uncle sam's balls while Muhammed Ali was a man and stood up for the truth."
58,2020-02-04 09:18:08,eymn7m,"He's suppose to be the epitome of American masculinity. Everyone thinks of him when they think of manhood and cowboys. He was a pro war pro government suck up who just played a cowboy.

Roy Rogers is the real thing.

Even Toby Keith who I hate actually owns horses and probably has some skills. 

George Straight who never really spoke about politics but supported Bush is a team roper"
59,2020-02-04 18:05:43,eymn7m,Yes he does. Don't be a mud baby.

62,2020-02-04 11:53:31,eymn7m,Yeah probably not though. It turns out the political leadership of this country wasn‚Äôt big on sending an a list actor out to get shot. Not to mention his studio was going to sue the shit out of him
63,2020-02-04 12:12:35,eymn7m,"No it didn‚Äôt though. Those events were still recent in the mind and generally seen as great by the us population. Wayne was just the best at conveying the American attitude.

How dare Wayne support a war that a huge number of Americans also supported"
64,2020-02-04 10:14:16,eymn7m,No idea. I‚Äôm guessing that isn‚Äôt the persons first name either so that makes it even harder to guess.
65,2020-02-04 15:26:35,eymn7m,What country do you live in?

With that out of the way, all the other silly problems should now resolve quickly."

Why is equality so frowned on by guys like you? Im not saying europeans havent dpne terrible shit, but so have others and europeans have done some good shit and plus either way it doesnt help ANYBODY to keep dividing people right npw when we should be building a more unified future.

89,2020-02-03 18:18:47,eyay1i,You know the funny thing? Black conditions became worse when segregation ended. I am for an African unified future and for us to work together and build our own towns and society's. Oh and btw I wouldnt throw the word success around so easily. Sorry not everyone cares about money.
90,2020-02-03 18:09:52,eyay1i,"you are like the feminists who say all men are rapists, and the fact that you don't care just makes you dumber...or sad."
91,2020-02-03 19:21:36,eyay1i,"With my smartassedness aside I have a serious question for you. I certainly understand having pride in ones self but why do so based on something visual that doesn't mean anything? Why look to separate black and community to create a segregation for ones self. My community doesn't refer to skin color, it's made up of neighbors, people living in close proximity to one another and taking pride in the community they help to build and sustain."
92,2020-02-03 20:03:39,eyay1i,You are a boomer.
93,2020-02-03 18:30:29,eyay1i,I said success not money. And if you would prefer totally racially separated towns ypu dont understand what humanity needs to have a future. We need one cooperative world. Nationalism and racism are the source of the worlds problems and this sort of tripe just brings more of that. Mankinds history has been full of opression by and to all colors from the start. The point is we have the chance to change that now because the future is in our hands. But you must not see a point in that. Youd prefer more of the same I guess.
94,2020-02-03 18:15:51,eyay1i,Feminist is a little harsh.
95,2020-02-03 19:23:07,eyay1i,Look all the china towns. The asian community is working together to make something bigger. What would be wrong with Africans and African Americans doing the same?
96,2020-02-03 18:38:30,eyay1i,Yes white nationalism. And there does not seem to be an end to that anytime soon. Sorry I have a view of a future and its black.
97,2020-02-03 19:54:34,eyay1i,"Nothing at all because anything that builds better communities is a step in the right direction but even with things like a China Town, a Jewish community and the many other ways we look to separate ourselves I think more people need to look to just build stronger communities regardless of our physical appearance. There is nothing about the color of my skin or my ancestry than inherently makes me better or worse can anyone else do I look to simply help others in my community."
98,2020-02-03 19:43:33,eyay1i,"Black nationalism is no better. You are racist and using racist logic because youre power hungry. It really blows my mind that somebody can say ""my race is best because racism is wrong."" I'm done with this thread youre retarded."
99,2020-02-04 14:57:59,eyay1i,Unlike how he said black people are successful at EVERYTHING they do. Obviously in contrast to other people (white people). Because why would he be jealous of whites when blacks are ALWAYS successful (which means he believes they are a superior race.)
100,2020-02-03 19:49:40,eyay1i,"1. I am not balck nationalist

2. Look at the supposed black nationalists in history vs the white nationalist and I dare you to tell me they are the same thing. People compare the Black Panthers to the KKK. All the black panthers were doing was defending the black community and providing services. What was the KKK doing? That's right handing burning down black buisnesses. You can compare good to something that's always been evil."
101,2020-02-04 15:45:56,eyay1i,And he is allowed to believe that he just can't discriminate against others based upon that. I just don't understand why so many people are so happily restricting themselves to a silly thing like skin color.
102,2020-02-04 13:54:12,eyay1i,Reinstating segregated towns in a post industrial society ends in race war inevitably. Youre a moron if you can't see that. Or maybe you are just afraid to come out and say thats what you want. Im not comparing anybody to the Kkk. What im saying is that if you are advocating ANYTHING other than EVERYBODY working together (that means blacks whites asians muslims jehovas witness atheists literally everybody) then the eventual result is conflict. Youre borderline retarded if you think saying black people should all stick with only eachother and the future is black and down with whitey cracker isnt just a new problem waiting to happen instead of a cooperative solution to the ones we face. Youre mad that black people in america live in ghettos alot? (And theres poor whites too) try being a Muslim in china getting ypur body parts harvested in prison camps. Get your shit together dude. The human race will be gone in two hundred years if the whole wprld dpesnt come together and halt global warming and what you are suggesting is that blacks create there own society from scratch instead of everybody workimg together to make this one better. That will hurt ypur people mpre than help. Your preocupied woth ypur own sufferring and for that I am sorry fpr our you and our ancestors. I hope you find some peace dude blessed be.
103,2020-02-04 17:01:24,eyay1i,"Well yeah its not like its something worthy of exile I mean its just cultural preference. Thats been going on since the beginning of time. It isnt right still, but if its confined to an idea then he should still be treated like everybody else for the most part. The only thing is ideas always turn into actions and effect the way you treat people."
104,2020-02-04 15:39:31,eyay1i,I never said reinstate segregation I'm just saying black people should start our own communities
105,2020-02-04 17:07:29,eyay1i,That last sentence does say it all.

146,2020-03-28 12:14:47,fq51xf,I think that was about the time rumours of Beckham cheating on his wife came out.. after which he got his wife's name tattooed on his hand in the devnagari script. We being Indians obviously ate up the story about a famous cheating star and a Hindi tattoo on a white person. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
147,2020-03-28 05:36:24,fq51xf,"And stories doing rounds that posh loved him when he was nothing and still with him. I don't know genuineness of this, but that how thr love story is romanticized in media"
148,2020-03-28 08:53:16,fq51xf,"Beckham was really crazy famous because of the following, other than of course for being married to Victoria: Good looks. Girls were really crazy about him. He used to play for ManU, which at that point of time was the most prestigious club to play for, and EPL was the richest league combined with the influence English media had over the then footballing narrative.mHe was the Captain of a star-studded Engish football team. It was almost a dream team of sorts. He won many crucial matches for England. Most importantly he was one of the best dead ball player of that time and one with good looks, unlike the handful others. Dead ball specialists always have had a huge fan following because of them being at the centre stage during climax phases of matches.

And as for the need to be famous? The answer is brand endorsements. He used to be the highest earning footballer in spite of him not being amongst the top 10 footballers of his time by a distance!"
149,2020-03-28 12:05:16,fq51xf,+ he used to cheat on her every 2 weeks

I have a sneaking suspicion that this is also the same guy who was banned from either this subreddit or that one a month or two ago, just with a new account this time.

I'll be totally convinced it's the same guy if his posts start getting more and more depraved, with extreme bondage, actual porn images, and some seriously out-there fetish choices.

216,2020-04-20 12:17:36,g4rnjt,"Most of the Deepika fandom doesn't like Ranveer and SLB.

Most of the Ranveer fandom doesn't like Deepika.

Deepveer is niche.

Deepika fans like her with Ranbir."
217,2020-04-20 12:44:56,g4rnjt,"Nope. Ranveer is very smart. He waits for uproar to die down and when people have moved to other controversy , he posts some caption on DP‚Äôs insta or some PR article comes to praise him as good husband and fans go ‚Äúawww he is such a good husband‚Äù. 

Their core fan base hate the other spouse . DP‚Äôs fans mostly ship her with RK . They think RS is not good enough for their Queen. She married beneath her stardom . 

Ranveer‚Äôs fans think he deserved better and younger wife. DP overshadows everything and he hasn‚Äôt got a good deal. Her rants about RK also doesn‚Äôt help. 

They‚Äôll be like Ajay - Kajol. Their fans have been hating the spouse for so many years now ."
218,2020-04-20 12:43:17,g4rnjt,"No they won't. It's a norm for celebrities to wind up in controversies now and then, They know sooner or later something else will catch people's attention and they'll forget. Plus, Deepika's controversies aren't even that huge and she doesn't even get as much trolling others have to go through. Ranveer will be fine, his name is barely coming up in any of this mess."
219,2020-04-20 14:59:45,g4rnjt,Nope. Ranveer is the bigger star in India now.

224,2020-04-20 12:52:30,g4rnjt,Why does their fandom hate their spouse? Deepika I understand. Most of them would be randeep shippers. Why do ranveer fans hate deepika?
225,2020-04-20 14:27:23,g4rnjt,Why don't they like SLB? Without his costume dramas Deepika wouldn't have reached anywhere.
226,2020-04-20 13:02:49,g4rnjt,People were saying the other day they are planning to boycott 83 since she is in it. I wonder how serious they were.

229,2020-04-20 12:31:35,g4rnjt,She is bi her ex gf photos kissing went viral hence they broke up.
230,2020-04-20 14:29:00,g4rnjt,She was receiving backlashes for her promiscuity and generally shitty antics. That is not a trash reason to dump anyone.
231,2020-04-20 12:53:25,g4rnjt,They don't like Deepika's attitude.
232,2020-04-20 12:35:48,g4rnjt,I think their first breakup was because of the Vma and all of that right? I remember they stopped getting spotted after that.
233,2020-04-20 12:56:33,g4rnjt,I don't think that Liam is that shallow.

**We've had to disallow ageplay to stay in compliance with Reddit's sitewide rules against sexually suggestive content involving minors.**

Your post used the word **Teen** which triggered this post to be removed. If your post isn't about ageplay you can either report this post for any reason to have mods review it and approve it or just repost without the word Teen in it. 

**However if this is about ageplay we take it very seriously and reposting ageplay content will result in a quick and immediate ban.**
  
This is a copy of the original post:

Hi redditors,

So here's the deal I'm looking to setup a roleplay where you would play as a r34 character, I have preferences, but if you have one that I know of that you really want to play that's fine by me.

We would start by setting up the roleplay, brainstorming about what kind of relationship we'd have and so on and so forth.

Now to my preferences, note that they might change if I come to think of someone else that i had forgotten

Anime:

All Dragonball girls.

All My Hero Acadamia girls

Misty, May and Flannery from Pok√®mon

Sora and Kari from Digimon

Cartoons:

Kim Possible, Bonnie and Monique

Velma

Nani from Lilo and Stitch

Gwen Tennyson from Ben 10

Sam and Alex from Totally Spies

Brandi Harington from Brandi and Mr Whiskers

Any of the girls in Sonic the Hedgehog

Ashoka from Star wars 

Raven, Jinx and Starfire from Teen Titans

Games:

Tali, Miranda, FemShep, Liara, Peebee, Vetra and Jack from Mass Effect 

Undyne and Alphys from Undertale

Ciri and Triss from The Witcher

Kasumi and Ayane from Dead or Alive

Ellie from the Last of Us.

Tristana, Lulu, Jinx and Poppy from League of Legends.

Celebrities:

Mia Khalifa
Emma Watson
Selena Gomez
Miley Cyrus
Debby Ryan
Ashley Tisdale
Brenda Song
Emily Osment
Miranda Cosgrove
Jeanette Mccurdy
Ariana Grande
Victoria Justice

And that's the list for now, note that I'm not telling you to play all the characters from a single show, but I do also not mind if you want to do that.

And of course all characters and participants have to be 18+.

Hope to hear from you soon!

463,2020-06-24 18:21:20,hf4m0r,"i love that album though i wish we could hear Sia‚Äôs original demos. i finally saw the movie last week after loving the album for 18 months, i thought it was pretty good though not perfect"
464,2020-06-24 18:00:02,hf4m0r,Her cover of Black Sheep from the Scott Pilgrim movie is top tier
465,2020-06-24 19:06:21,hf4m0r,I want her to get a number 1 just to see all those salty tearsü§≠
466,2020-06-24 18:18:58,hf4m0r,ANOTHER?
467,2020-06-25 03:32:38,hf4m0r,She Said was my favorite Disney Channel Original Movie bop from a non-main Disney girl üò´
468,2020-06-24 17:54:39,hf4m0r,#JusticeForReplay
469,2020-06-24 17:42:07,hf4m0r,Honestly I still bump her album to this day and love it. I wish she would do more music.
470,2020-06-24 18:16:28,hf4m0r,ugh i remember bopping to her album when it was released!! its been years since i last listened to it and it was such a gem (fireflies and scared were a SERVE)! in fact... now would be a good time to listen ü§ß
471,2020-06-24 22:05:42,hf4m0r,"I'm so, so hoping she continues to participate in the Euphoria soundtrack and releases more solos!!!! 

Her voice was so special on All For Us."
472,2020-06-24 22:30:31,hf4m0r,i‚Äôm glad she‚Äôs done some singing in her acting roles though like in Euphoria and The Greatest Showman. i love her voice
473,2020-06-24 23:57:55,hf4m0r,"I came to comment just that! She's gorgeous, charismatic, has a beautiful voice, can dance her ass off and there's just something about her.. I don't know. 

Her debut album was a great album for a girl her age at the time. Like, top-notch R&B/Pop. While Replay was the most popular song off the album, Butterflies, Putcha Body Down, Only When You're Close, Bottle You Up, Scared, and My Baby are such good jams! Bottle You Up is my favorite. 

When she released Something New back in 2016 I thought she was gonna try and get back to music, but she didn't. I didn't like the Chris Brown feature, though. I think it would've sounded better with a female rapper or something, but none were really popping other than Nicki back then. 

I really hope she gets back to it eventually. She's on the level of Tinashe in terms of being a triple threat, for sure."
474,2020-06-24 19:58:47,hf4m0r,the meme of her dancing to replay at the dubai mall makes me laugh so much omg
475,2020-06-24 17:05:32,hf4m0r,^^
476,2020-06-25 15:32:07,hf4m0r,"Something New and Replay are SUCH bops! 

I mean her debut album isn‚Äôt half bad really, and If she released something now you KNOW it would be huge. 

Zendaya, Normani, Tinashe & Keke Palmer doing a collaboration together is my dream."
477,2020-06-25 15:47:18,hf4m0r,"Well she literally was a Disney pop star. I feel like having already released an album disqualifies her from this hypothetical conversation.

Would love for her to release more music though."
478,2020-06-24 22:31:05,hf4m0r,Just her counting down is a bop.
479,2020-06-24 23:05:34,hf4m0r,Her singing is insane. I watched her cover of a Lana song and was literally blown away by how amazing she sounds. And she‚Äôs still singing on Dynasty. She‚Äôd have an amazing singing career but I guess acting is where her heart is at.
480,2020-06-25 00:36:30,hf4m0r,"YES! I'd love a ""Take A Hint""/""Give It Up""-type duet with Ariana on a 2020 Liz Gillies album. and she has enough clout from Victorious and Dynasty to pull it off tbh"
481,2020-06-25 03:49:40,hf4m0r,Loved her version of Bizarre Love Triangle
482,2020-06-25 01:13:17,hf4m0r,She's not a movie star??
483,2020-06-24 23:46:24,hf4m0r,His singing in Moulin Rouge was amazing
484,2020-06-24 20:01:46,hf4m0r,I would be ALL over that.
485,2020-06-25 02:36:53,hf4m0r,"God I loveeee his voice in Moulin Rouge. 

I think he would have been the most successful during that weird time period where every band sounded British: The Killers, Franz Ferdinand, Modest Mouse, Jet"
486,2020-06-24 17:18:00,hf4m0r,Every single person who used to watch victorious has been waiting for this to happen üëÄ I think she said she wanted to be an actress and not a singer though and I do respect that it‚Äôs her own life to live.
487,2020-06-24 17:14:07,hf4m0r,"Yep, and according to Victoria Justice, she sings"
488,2020-06-24 17:52:13,hf4m0r,is it bad that i still want another ari/liz collab
489,2020-06-24 18:18:20,hf4m0r,or a rock singer!
490,2020-06-24 18:09:46,hf4m0r,Indie pop? I could see her being at least mid tier. Not huge but I could see her racking 1 or 2 big hits.
491,2020-06-25 03:34:57,hf4m0r,"She did get her start on Broadway after all, so she definitely has the chops for it!"
492,2020-06-24 17:50:51,hf4m0r,"Because movies are seen as more prestigous, usually require less time and effort than making and touring albums, and can pay better for big names"
493,2020-06-24 18:12:37,hf4m0r,"JLo is the only household name I can think of that was an actress before jumping to music, and while she‚Äôs obviously been very successful at both, she‚Äôs not exactly critically acclaimed in either"
494,2020-06-24 18:43:29,hf4m0r,"I can't find it now, but I read a quote from DJ Jazzy Jeff about why Will Smith stopped making music that went something like ""It's not that he doesn't want to make music, but when you're an A-list movie star studios don't want you to be seen as anything other than a movie star"""

496,2020-06-24 19:50:37,hf4m0r,"Kylie was an actress in an Aussie soap opera before ""I Should Be So Lucky"" blew up. I think back in the day, actor/actress to singer transition was easier than today but it was still hard."
497,2020-06-24 20:07:26,hf4m0r,Madonna... celebrated in movies... ü§î
498,2020-06-25 00:50:37,hf4m0r,"reason A: musicians are playing into their own persona all the time, so when fans like their work, they feel attached to that person and feel like they know who they are. as opposed to actors, who are always playing someone else and are mostly inconsistent with the types of characters they play, so it's harder to connect to them (this is why it's easier to move from TV to music than movies to music‚Äî because TV stars keep playing the same role and therefore their fans feel a deeper connection with them)

reason B: when musicians put out new music, you're most likely going to like it if you enjoy all their other music. it's different with actors, because every project is usually someone else's vision and there's less consistency (unless it's someone who produces all their own movies like Amy Schumer or Adam Sandler). this is more reserved for directors in the film world, but not many people follow directors (because they don't see them).

and because of reasons A & B, musicians transitioning to movies will have support because the fans already know who they are, whereas actors transitioning to music have a lot to prove because not many people have a sense of who they are as a person, and they might associate actors with a specific role."
499,2020-06-25 00:55:39,hf4m0r,"this is my favorite answer. I 100% would've bought Zac Efron's album back in the day. hell, even 2015 I probably would've bought his album. in 2020, I'd at least stream through each song once"
500,2020-06-25 14:25:06,hf4m0r,Zac Efron can't sing. His vocals during HSM 1 were Drew Seely
501,2020-06-26 05:25:47,hf4m0r,Blake's look/style aesthetic is so boring though. She'd have to be a country/AC star.
502,2020-06-24 21:43:23,hf4m0r,I imagine Kali Uchis but a bit darker.
503,2020-06-24 20:52:31,hf4m0r,"I had the same feeling about Hannah Montana. Like yea she had her own movie, but I see that as more of a documentary. She could‚Äôve really made it on the big screen."
504,2020-06-25 07:24:59,hf4m0r,Thanks for the reminder of that movie! Who else loved the 80's Wham! take off song they did in the opener *Pop! Goes My Heart* back in 2007?
505,2020-06-24 18:22:16,hf4m0r,"probably cause it‚Äôs mostly asking for lists of people

still a fun thread though"
506,2020-06-24 19:33:03,hf4m0r,"She actually has a fair bit of music on Spotify! A lot of it is quite old, but she sounds good in it imo"

508,2020-06-24 20:55:13,hf4m0r,I wish we could watch her Cabaret somewhere. The bootlegs were shot with a calculator. She sounded good! And she got La La Land because of that role.
509,2020-06-24 19:32:00,hf4m0r,Justice for Turn Up The Beef

512,2020-06-24 21:47:25,hf4m0r,"She‚Äôs got that this is us money now, I‚Äôm glad that she‚Äôs the biggest thing to all the middle aged moms (and me) who watch it"
513,2020-06-25 06:25:35,hf4m0r,"She tried that and was not for her. Hell i still know someone who dislikes Mandy from her launch as a teen popstar.

I think she's happier not trying for that popstar life. I know folks who saw her years back, playing at a bar with a small band and Mandy was just so happy and hugging everyone and just happy to have this freedom to be herself now."
514,2020-06-24 23:30:33,hf4m0r,she just released an album
515,2020-06-24 20:06:38,hf4m0r,I stan Camila Mendes
516,2020-06-24 22:04:50,hf4m0r,Have we seen the musical episodes? I can barely get through them cause of the singing
517,2020-06-24 20:02:06,hf4m0r,I was so sad she didn‚Äôt perform the Oscar performance of The Place Where Lost Things Go. I heard it‚Äôs because of stage fright :/
518,2020-06-24 23:52:01,hf4m0r,"i am OBSESSED with anna kendrick, but i feel like she‚Äôs too ‚Äútheater kid‚Äù to be a pop girl. like the problem that lea michelle had after glee except anna kendrick is waaaaay more likeable"
519,2020-06-24 19:38:59,hf4m0r,Was it huge because of vocals or because of the viral piece of using the cups
520,2020-06-24 22:01:47,hf4m0r,I watched (and hated but thats besides the point) Into the Woods and was flabbergasted by how big her range is. She hit that falsetto and I was not ready for it.
521,2020-06-24 22:29:18,hf4m0r,honestly her singing output in films the last decade is impressive; she was in SEVEN movie musicals
522,2020-06-24 22:29:24,hf4m0r,Literally just Interesting Woman Bad
523,2020-06-25 01:11:17,hf4m0r,She's a woman
524,2020-06-25 15:59:38,hf4m0r,"YES if you search i think it's currently called ""definitely not the last five years 2015 movie with anna kendrick and jeremy jordan"" the OP is just chef's kiss!"

527,2020-06-24 20:02:33,hf4m0r,I vastly prefer it to the original and I wish they‚Äôd officially release it
528,2020-06-25 06:19:49,hf4m0r,"Eeeeh, i find she strains to hard in the second set of lyrics and chorus and that overall does not suit her voice. Like it's ok but the actual Metric version is far better."
529,2020-06-24 20:03:18,hf4m0r,Those salty MALE white supremacist nerd tears

532,2020-06-24 20:49:25,hf4m0r,Replay was THAT song for me in 6th grade.
533,2020-06-24 20:03:40,hf4m0r,Still the best song titled Replay.
534,2020-06-24 18:04:21,hf4m0r,"Same ! I love her album too and I still listen to it sometimes

At least she is still acting in some musicals and I hope she will do more !"
535,2020-06-24 18:58:48,hf4m0r,"!!! Fireflies was my RINGTONE and on repeat for a solid couple of months. Her voice was made for that song, her low notes on the verses, the whole atmosphere of the song, the thumping beat and the bridge are *\*chef's kiss\** perfect. First time I've seen fireflies get any recognition on this sub."
536,2020-06-24 17:42:43,hf4m0r,"She‚Äôs a great actress, but she could give us a cute little EP."
537,2020-06-24 18:17:46,hf4m0r,"Well judging by the ever-increasing amount of musical numbers that she's been getting on Dynasty, she's at least set on being an actress who sings. I'd expect her to end up being cast in a bunch of movie musicals"
538,2020-06-24 17:43:53,hf4m0r,I'm still waiting for her to direct a horror movie.
539,2020-06-25 00:15:52,hf4m0r,"I imagine she's gotten a front row seat to what happens when you go above a certain threshold of fame and was like ""no thanks"". 

After Victorious she starred in Sex, Drugs & Rock & Roll, playing the daughter of an aging rock star. Her character was the lead singer in rock band. It had pretty terrible ratings and wasn't that great and ended after two seasons.

But yeah, always wished she did more music."

edit: Also some Aint No Other Man?"
543,2020-06-24 18:37:30,hf4m0r,YES. I agree with this.
544,2020-06-25 00:41:33,hf4m0r,"they may have been referring to the genre of indie pop or being a literal independent pop artist instead of implying the success she'd have, but ""big hits"" seems like a stretch. she could definitely get a following amongst a niche group of pop fans but I can't imagine she'd make it to radio"
545,2020-06-25 03:11:30,hf4m0r,Jlo started off as a dancer on a major show though. . Drake I will say is a better example.

547,2020-06-24 18:45:42,hf4m0r,TIL Will Smith was a musician. Lol.
548,2020-06-24 17:36:08,hf4m0r,I can‚Äôt believe I forgot about him lol. And he‚Äôs a standup comedian too! How amazing.
549,2020-06-25 03:10:21,hf4m0r,Drake and Seth Mcfarlane are probably the most successful example of actor turned musician
550,2020-06-24 21:03:56,hf4m0r,"Neighbours has actually given us a bunch of cool artists. Beyond Kylie, we've got Natalie Imbruglia, Jason Donovan, Holly Valance, and Delta Goodrem (although she was already trying music when she joined Neighbours, but she wasn't big). Also apparently a bunch of other people who were really successful in Australia if not internationally.

Home and Away has done it's fair share of star making too. Those two shows are absolute talent machines that we really owe Australia big time for."
551,2020-06-24 20:51:15,hf4m0r,Oh sorry. Wasn‚Äôt Desperately Seeking Susan quite well received? I wasn‚Äôt born yet when Evita came out but iirc it wasn‚Äôt known as that bad.

554,2020-06-25 15:00:51,hf4m0r,"His vocals in HSM2, HSM3, and Hairspray were him. He can definitely sing."
555,2020-06-24 21:56:18,hf4m0r,"I could also see her doing some type of LDR vibe, but I guess Kali and LDR have somewhat similar styles."
556,2020-06-25 00:54:09,hf4m0r,"I liked Hannah but she always seemed a bit fake to me, like she was hiding something. I've combed through her lyrics for clues, but no luck!!"
557,2020-06-24 20:54:14,hf4m0r,Omg I had forgotten she had released like two albums a long time ago. I liked the genre and her voice totally fits.

559,2020-06-24 21:47:57,hf4m0r,"She‚Äôs so good in the show, too. I‚Äôm happy we get to hear her sing."

All I meant was that if she WANTED to be a bigger pop star, she definitely could have. She has the looks, aesthetic, and voice for it. She could have been like Lacey Musgraves/early Taylor and get some sort of viral status releasing soft folk/country music. Or she could have received the kind of level Carly has rn, if not be bigger, with some more pop-oriented music. All I meant was, Mandy Moore is incredibly talented, and I See The Light is still one of my fav Disney songs."
561,2020-06-24 23:31:39,hf4m0r,Yah I love it. I saw it at target and my heart swooned.

587,2020-06-24 22:23:34,hf4m0r,she has a couple songs on youtube if I remember correctly! and yeah they have very LDR vibes
588,2020-06-25 00:40:47,hf4m0r,she‚Äôs better but i think it makes her less relatable
589,2020-06-25 03:33:20,hf4m0r,Plus more of the world needs to be introduced to the gift that is Jeremy Jordan!!
590,2020-06-24 20:42:51,hf4m0r,Oh no! She wished the media was a little more inclusive üò®
591,2020-06-24 22:41:02,hf4m0r,Issa bop. But Zendaya‚Äôs is a mood.
592,2020-06-25 01:30:28,hf4m0r,Zendaya‚Äôs Replay is far superior. His broken iPod can melt.
593,2020-06-24 22:15:36,hf4m0r,Zendaya‚Äôs is still the best of them.

596,2020-06-25 13:41:33,hf4m0r,BOTH ANNA AND JEREMY WERE SO GOOD!!!
597,2020-06-24 22:03:06,hf4m0r,Cis-het white male gamers are literally the most oppressed minority.
598,2020-06-25 01:52:38,hf4m0r,"Makes me sad because I‚Äôve been a fan of J. Lo since I was a kid & I really think Hustlers is some of the best work she‚Äôs put out so if she didn‚Äôt get an Oscar for that or the Selena movie, I don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs gonna take to get her one"
599,2020-06-25 04:37:48,hf4m0r,Now I kinda want Last of Us 3 with Bree Larson just to spite them
600,2020-06-24 23:40:48,hf4m0r,And their worst oppression is seeing secondary characters casted as nonwhite people or women. Oh the HORROR.
601,2020-06-25 03:48:21,hf4m0r,"Tbh while I think both her and Sandler definitely deserved Oscar noms, I don‚Äôt really feel sorry either of them and kind of think it‚Äôs on them that they didn‚Äôt get nominations. The Oscars love the ~prestigious~ clout they (for some reason) have and both JLo and Adam Sandler have reputations for making awful movies.

You can‚Äôt just make trash movies for 2 decades and then give one great performance and expect people to start taking you seriously. Ideally, we *would* reward people based on the single performance alone but that‚Äôs just not the way the industry works and if I, as a non-actor, know that,  then they should‚Äôve too and prepared/campaigned accordingly instead of making low quality cash grab movies for almost their entire careers."
602,2020-06-25 02:03:46,hf4m0r,"Not play a stripper because although it‚Äôs more diverse now, the majority of voters is still old and conservative."
603,2020-06-25 13:59:37,hf4m0r,"Yes! Either that, or cast her in a Star Wars film. The gamer outrage would be off the charts."
604,2020-06-25 02:05:08,hf4m0r,"Yeah, don‚Äôt you just hate it when you‚Äôre watching a show with a predominantly white cast, and then some minority shows up on screen for 30 seconds? Makes my blood boil, goddamn SJWs and their forced agenda. I demand to speak with the CEO of cultural Marxism."
605,2020-06-25 04:55:36,hf4m0r,"This too, sometimes the award was given to someone who was overdue even though their nominated work that year wasn‚Äôt their career best or even the best in the category. Which is totally fine."

638,2020-06-29 21:14:11,hi7sgt,"Thank you, couldn't have said it better myself, before you guys start judging from snippets, wait for the full songs, the song with Miley sounds like a hit and Gunna flows nice on OTR I like his verse, Kid Cudi doesnt sound great on Good Times, doesn't fit the flow and the 2nd verse of that song is just godly, but we've only heard 2 lines, if the light is on the album, I think we've got a No. 1, let's appreciate what we're getting"

Its gonna be trippie for sure (tell me u luv me) And i think Ski mask/yachty or someone related to juice (close friend). The cudi And Miley either wont release or they will be on the next album"
641,2020-06-29 20:24:55,hi7sgt,Deadass lmao juice can do no wrong and the album will be fire no matter what... there is a small percent chance that it could get fucked up but I don‚Äôt think it will

Also ski mask is not on the album... also it doesn‚Äôt have to be a close friend but if that‚Äôs just your guess that‚Äôs cool urs is as good as mine, and the next album will be outsiders so it‚Äôs more personal I don‚Äôt think that song would be on it considering the snippet we have, but you never know how they will do it"

""I dont really care"" bruh dont post to Reddit if u dont want other people to give their opinions, tf u on. U literally didnt say anything Smart in this comment except the fact that juice wanted to work with cudi. He IS a random ft."

Nigga he is a friend, they had convos tweeted at each other, not best friends of course but there is a level of respect so ITS NOT RANDOM random is Miley Cyrus you fucking random dumbass nigga and even then I think we can have random people on open verses for fire songs...

I HAVENT SAID ANYTHING SMART??? NIGGA YOU LITERALLY SAID YOU SEE THE MILEY CYRUS FEATURE ON THE ALBUM AFTER THIS ONE LIKE ARE YOU FUCKING DUMB DO YOU KNOW THE VIBES THAT OUTSIDERS IS SUPPOSED TO BE. Did you hear the snippet... you sound dumb"

1. I dont listen to ALL snippets. I havent Heard the Miley Cyrus one. Stfu.
2. U keep saying the n Word And i can fucking tell Ur 100% white, u just keep spamming it. 
3. So u post something, u know that u will get other comments And then dont care what other ppl say?

Ur so fucking retarded bruh i cant even describe it in words. CUDI ISNT A CLOSE FRIEND LIKE TRIPPIE SKI MASK OR YACHTY, what the fuck is Ur point, attention?"
651,2020-06-30 15:11:41,hi7sgt,"1. You haven‚Äôt heard the Miley Cyrus one.. okay that‚Äôs fine why tell me to stfu lmao

2.

3.know I appreciate other comments but after someone says dumb shit like you have, it shows me how ignorant you are on the topic so idgaf what else dumb shit you have to say ‚Äúcudi is random‚Äù like ... Cudi is not random lmfao Ariana Grande would be random lady Gaga would be random smhhh"
652,2020-06-30 16:00:48,hi7sgt,"Hm so Cudi isn't random probably because u like him, that's my guess. Also stfu because u act like im a fucking idiot for not hearing the snippet"

713,2020-06-29 06:32:13,hhupnc,Did you enjoy it? I have to try it out now for her
714,2020-06-29 06:32:42,hhupnc,Yes I did
715,2020-06-29 06:34:39,hhupnc,I am so hard for her now
716,2020-06-29 06:54:35,hhupnc,"Her tight body is driving me nuts, I am going to have to cum soon"
717,2020-06-29 06:27:36,hhupgh,But why is she ruining it? It‚Äôs not like the original isn‚Äôt available to listen to anymore. Maybe it‚Äôs even a way for people to discover those classic bands.
718,2020-06-29 06:34:26,hhupgh,"Honestly, I feel like it‚Äôs more paying homage to those awesome bands and songs."
719,2020-06-29 06:24:41,hhupgh,"I dunno man she's got a voice that can actually do these covers,her Jolene cover was actually pretty good."
720,2020-06-29 06:42:43,hhupgh,"I can't stand any of her music including covers,  and it does mildly ruin great songs when covers become more popular and most people associate the song with the cover artist and spam the YouTube comments ""who's here because of Miley? Haha"" but it's nothing really. We can just not listen to it."
721,2020-06-29 07:56:30,hhupgh,"How is she ruining it though? Her voice is really versatile and sounds great with Rock. I think it‚Äôs just a subjective thing. She‚Äôs probably one of the top best female singers in pop in my opinion, and every cover she does she makes it her own and does well with it."
722,2020-06-29 10:33:34,hhupgh,"Just don't listen to it then. There are people and bands all over the world butchering classics and making covers.

Her cover of Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds with the Flaming Lips though - genuinely brilliant. Unsettling as fuck."
723,2020-06-29 08:47:38,hhupgh,"I don‚Äôt see what‚Äôs wrong with enjoying her covers. It means she has a great voice. What‚Äôs bad about having a great voice? I‚Äôm assuming you don‚Äôt like her voice which is completely your prerogative, but many enjoy her voice and that‚Äôs their prerogative. Idk man I love the Cyrus family they just seem super cool. I love Noah‚Äôs voice too and the band Trace Cyrus was in. I don‚Äôt like that many celebrities I love Miley though."
724,2020-06-29 06:35:38,hhupgh,[deleted]
725,2020-06-29 06:36:17,hhupgh,I don‚Äôt like her voice. It sounds like she‚Äôs pinching her nose shut.
726,2020-06-29 06:41:24,hhupgh,Jolene was the shit. She did that one well
727,2020-06-29 07:57:27,hhupgh,"Yeah, and that Summertime Sadness one, there was a few other bands she did and I was like, damn, the girls voice is straight up versatile."
728,2020-06-29 06:43:29,hhupgh,"If she's ruining Beatles song, she wouldn't be the first."
729,2020-06-29 08:48:38,hhupgh,Check out her Lilac Wine cover
730,2020-06-29 08:10:31,hhupgh,"I don't think I've ever heard someone ruin a beetle's song. most people make them better.

(Ya know, because compared to modern music they have no idea what they're doing.)"
731,2020-07-03 17:19:45,hhupgh,Nah they did that themseleves
732,2020-06-29 15:53:11,hhupgh,"By ruining I'm being subjective as music tends to be subjective. IMO, the covers of *Helter Skelter* I've heard are lame, save for Siouxsie Sioux's (/Creatures?) cover, but they do a lame version of *Dear Prudence*.

and I think there's a lot of good modern music (check my posts for a few of them :D )."

760,2020-06-28 19:57:43,hhkxzo,i have already given up on this album. my expectations are very low but the outsiders i have VERY high expectations when that comes out like next year
761,2020-06-28 21:28:59,hhkxzo,"Seriously, do you know how many times people from his management has said ‚Äúalbum coming soon‚Äù or when someone ask they say ‚Äúsooner than you expect‚Äù"
762,2020-06-29 03:16:05,hhkxzo,"I do agree with some of the things you're saying, they haven't given us any information at all because they want it to be a surprise drop but I don't think that's the way to go

Bibby confirmed earlier that the album would have only 2 features though (Kid Cudi and Trippie Redd, most likely) however the reply on twitter was deleted for whatever reason

And one of Juice's friends (chris long) said that it wasn't confirmed that Gunna would be on OTR, they were just experimenting. The song has an open verse and apparently was always meant to have a feature, imo Gunna didn't do that bad of a job, but what are the better options that you would like to see?"
763,2020-06-29 09:35:28,hhkxzo,bibby just confirmed that the album has 2 features
764,2020-06-29 16:31:55,hhkxzo,"if ""the light"" is on the album that would be great."
765,2020-06-29 09:19:03,hhkxzo,"Update: apparently Chris Long said that the Gunna feature for ""On The Run"" was experimental and isn't necessarily the final product; it isn't confirmed"
766,2020-07-31 06:11:33,hhkxzo,update: it was fire lmao
767,2020-06-28 20:05:28,hhkxzo,"i ain't given up hope yet, im sure we'll have some fire songs i just wanna see it high on the charts and on the radio and everything"
768,2020-06-29 03:19:48,hhkxzo,"I think someone like Roddy Ricch, The Kid Laroi, or maybe lil uzi vert might be a better fit, i really think that ""On The Run"" is hit-song material so I think they should have a really, really good feature to match"
769,2020-06-29 09:36:07,hhkxzo,sweet! hope they picked a good tracklist üî•
770,2020-06-30 03:22:13,hhkxzo,i hope it is üî•
771,2020-06-28 20:06:51,hhkxzo,they are overloading it with features. like miley cyrus. who tf. idc if jarad wanted that. it‚Äôs jus something ion wanna hear
772,2020-06-29 09:05:14,hhkxzo,A Boogie would have been great too
773,2020-06-29 09:40:12,hhkxzo,">sweet! hope they picked a good tracklist üî•

I woulda liked lots of features cause he never had an album with lots of them and I love it when juice collabs with other artists"
774,2020-06-28 20:40:51,hhkxzo,I think that miley song is Miley ft. Juice not Juice ft Miley
775,2020-06-29 01:01:20,hhkxzo,"Just be lucky yall getting music. And you said even juice want a feature with miley, you still wouldnt wanna hear it, well don't listen to it."
776,2020-07-03 19:58:52,hhkxzo,Only 2 features
777,2020-06-29 10:28:00,hhkxzo,"Trippie is one, I hope the other one is Thugger or Cudi
But I don't really believe there being only 2"

It is a really shit cover though."
784,2020-06-29 19:14:48,hhjbrd,"the rockabilly/country thing isn't really doing it for me with her voice, she should've gone for just a straight-rock feel imo. her voice is killer but the backing band and production don't really enhance the original, they should've modernized it. slide guitar is really low in the mix and in general it feels like bass, drums, and Miley are cranked with little else

if you mute it and play the original Beatles behind it it's actually the best version of the song"
785,2020-06-28 19:01:13,hhjbrd,Hasn't she died from an overdose yet?
786,2020-06-30 05:06:37,hhjbrd,Music is fucked if shes one of todays top artists

791,2020-06-28 19:37:53,hhjbrd,She has. I don't care if you don't believe it.

807,2020-06-29 22:49:17,hhj0td,I would actually say that Christopher Nolan is a 5w4 instead 5w6 bc of his insane story plots. he writes all of his movies so he‚Äôs either really balanced in his wings or i think he‚Äôs much more in touch with his 4 wing. you don‚Äôt get plots like tenet or inception without a 4 wing lol

810,2020-06-29 22:46:19,hhj0td,i actually think she‚Äôs a sp 3w4 with a tritype 3-1-6. sp 3w4 often mistypes as 1s.

This is seen when she won‚Äôt let the boys copy her HW (most of the time), and when Hermione is mad when she thinks Harry put felix felicis into Ron‚Äôs drink for quidditch tryouts, etc..

829,2020-06-28 23:13:27,hhj0td,"""Through denying their feelings of fear to one extent or another, Sexual Sixes go against danger from a position of strength; therefore, they have a passion for searching for or securing a position of strength. And it's not just a strong character they seek, but the kind of strength that makes somebody else afraid-they want to assume a powerful enough to hold the enemy at a distance. These Sixes display a forcefulness that comes from no wanting to be weak, and they don't allow for weakness in themselves....""

"".....Sexual Sixes have a need not just for strength but for intimidation. As Naranjo suggests, this expression of intimidation is very much the essence of the character; if they appear strong, they won't be attacked. ....""

"".....Sexual Sixes give off the impression that they could get violent with anybody at any time, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that they have no fear. It is precisely out of a sense of fear that their anticipation of an attack comes-there is a somewhat paranoid imagining of danger, a belief that anyone can turn into a threat. However, these Sixes usually do not look afraid; their visible character could hardly be called ""fearful"" from the outside.

In contrast to the Self-Preservation Six, who backs away from threats, the couterphobic Sexual Six tends to move toward risky situations, feeling a sense of safety in actually confronting danger rather than hiding from it or avoiding it. They convince themselves (and others) that they are not victims of fear; they are convinced that fear is an emotion that should be eliminated systemically.....""

"".....The fact that these Sixes regularly move against danger (or perceived danger) can, at times, give them the appearance of a rebel, a daredevil, a risk taker, an adrenaline junkie, or a troublemaker. In some cases, Sexual Sixes may be prone to megalomania or having a ""hero complex."" In their own way, they seek to be ""good guys"" to avoid being punished. They may have the illusion that they are spontaneous, but they tend not to be.

Sexual Sixes tend to be very contrarian: they always have an argument at hand to refute and contradict an opinion. Instead of thinking in terms of ""best-case"" or ""worst-case"" scenarios, they think in terms of contrarian scenarios-if the trend is for others to focus on the worst, they will focus on the best; but if everyone is focusing on the best, they will assert the worst.....""

She also used the time turner to take more classes, which to me screams 3.

The enneagram institute is really close on a lot of things and a great resource, but it‚Äôs super dangerous to type people, even your own friends, based on some blanket stereotypes. Understanding you‚Äôre a 6, I get that you‚Äôre leaning into the big group that‚Äôs a credible resource and I can dig you arguing an opinion. You‚Äôre a good questioner, question more on this one.

854,2020-06-29 11:42:55,hhj0td,"A lot of numbers are defiant. Both 6‚Äôs and 8‚Äôs can be this way specifically, from my observation he‚Äôs a little too irrationally aggressive. This is behavior not motivation."
855,2020-06-29 23:58:44,hhj0td,"Yes, and you're ignoring the part where I said, ""his main issue is with boundaries and being told no"", which is motivation. 

Will Hunting is a counterphobic 6, you can see the difference between the two. Everything Will does is fear based, even when he gets unruly and abrasive. He fears getting hurt (his trauma definitely plays into that, and there's nothing to suggest that enneagram type isn't born from trauma)."

This is based solely on the photos she chose. Speak Now is cute but not creative, Debut is boring and a little amateurish, and I just hate hate hate that slicked hair from rep. It always just looks greasy to me. Can‚Äôt get over it haha. As for why fearless is so high, idk I‚Äôve always loved the hair! I think the face she‚Äôs making is also really cute. I think the 1989 pose is really creative by choosing to cut off her eyes, and I like the Lover pose for the same type of reason, she‚Äôs looking down and away, it‚Äôs just an interesting camera angle to me."

RED and rep are perfect. 1989 and Lover I loooove the concepts/fonts/colors but don‚Äôt love the photo selects. Debut and Speak now I love the photos but don‚Äôt love the fonts and edits. Fearless is a complete miss for me."
862,2020-06-28 18:20:21,hhhnem,"1. 1989 - I thought the whole concept of polaroids was pretty fucking cool, and I love how underneath the polaroid were her initials and the year she was born in. I wish I got to do that at some point.
2. Red - This album cover itself is a reset from her from first 3 albums. I love the way she wasn't looking at the camera, and the album photoshoot was so vintage and hipster.
3. Reputation - I mean, c'mon? It's so loud, bold and in your face. This is basically indicating right here that the album is going to snatch our souls, which it did.
4. Fearless - I love the way she wasn't looking at the camera, and the way her hair stood out here for obvious reasons is nothing if not amazing.
5. Speak Now - She looked gorgeous, but the fact that the dress looked photoshoot doesn't make me rank this any higher.
6. Taylor Swift - This definitely screams I'm a country singer from Nashville, but that's all. Nothing special, honestly.
7. Lover - Lover is a great album, but this cover is so tacky. It looks badly edited, especially with those colours, and I could think of a million different pictures from the Lover album that would've been great replacements for this cover."

866,2020-06-29 00:12:21,hhhnem,"1. Reputation - as soon as you look at that cover, you know this album is unique. Also, it's so brave. She really just throws it in your face that she is not messing around anymore. 
2. 1989 - this is the most clever cover to me, with the polaroid aesthetic and only half of her face showing. 
3. Red - there's just something very graceful and pleasing about it. 
4. Fearless - another example of a cover that matches the album perfectly. Her haire looks like an explosive of feelings.
5. Lover - I love the colors, but I wish her photo was different. It looks less thought out than her other covers. If I could, I would instead have used the picture of her holding the flower in front of her eye. I feel like that could've flowed symbolically with the album, which I LOVE.
6. Debut - the least creative cover, but I get that it's her first one and she wants ppl to know her face.
7. Speak Now - this may be an unpopular opinion, but the cover is just too cheesy for me. It doesn't seem very creative and the picture is blurry, which throws me off."
867,2020-06-29 09:25:51,hhhnem,"1. 1989 - the entire aesthetic was completely spot on and reflected well the contents of the album.
2. Red - fantastic choice for a cover, the focus on the red lips was great.
3. Reputation - while I think that there were better photos taken in the rep photoshoot and while I am not a huge fan of greasy-looking hair, I've got to admire the thought behind it and overall look (and the font was great too!)
4. Fearless - it is very 2008, very country, very young and once again encapsulates the album perfectly.
5. Speak Now - I like this cover in general but, as some have already noted, it is cute but borderline tacky and does not really represent the maturity of the lyrics on SN.
6. Taylor Swift - I am not a fan of this album cover, but given that it was a debut of a teenage country singer, it just fits the overall theme.
7. Lover - ugh, please don't get me started. Ms Swift, how the hell out of so many great shoots you chose this particular photo and allowed it to be edited so much? I think that literally any other photo from this photo session would work better."
868,2020-06-28 19:41:37,hhhnem,"Best: *1989* has it all.

Said that, I‚Äôd love her to just embrace her shit. We all do that, we all have our moments, whether it‚Äôs because of a bad relationship or anything. We‚Äôre all just human anyway. It‚Äôs a good album and reflects a moment of her life, and even if she sees it as a mistake, we are made by our mistakes too."
900,2020-08-20 13:07:05,id9nnh,"Here we go again. 

Has she officially denounced every single era of her career?"
901,2020-08-20 13:10:28,id9nnh,dead petz and younger now could have basically been a career killing one two punch if she wasn‚Äôt such a notable figure in the industry. if she released another album in the vein of bangerz as a follow up she could have had a similar trajectory to ariana‚Äôs career from sweetener to thank u next. she will always have enough money and name recognition to do decently in the industry tho. she‚Äôs someone who will still be performing tributes at the grammys in like 30 years.
902,2020-08-20 18:10:12,id9nnh,"this thread is cracking me up. but it actually makes sense what she‚Äôs saying. and saying that. slide away was kind of the best direction after her break up. it‚Äôs such a great break up song. 

younger now (the song) still slaps tho"
903,2020-08-20 14:13:01,id9nnh,"I think you guys should listen to what she‚Äôs saying. She got lost in Liam... she was doing everything for him, changing her behaviour for him, etc. I‚Äôve experienced this myself when I‚Äôve been in love and that‚Äôs not always a good thing. You start to change everything about yourself for this other person, to make them love you. So while this can sound like her typical ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not me‚Äù bs, I think this time she makes a really good point that I can relate to."
904,2020-08-20 13:57:52,id9nnh,"I mean, it really didn't. Malibu is still one of her best songs."
905,2020-08-20 12:58:50,id9nnh,"Younger Now definitely made sense in her career, it was her ""going back to my roots as a white singer by using accoustic guitars around the 7-year mark"" album (looking at you Gaga), it just wasn't that good of an album. If it didn't make sense career-wise, her label wouldn't have allowed for it to happen. Malibu put her back on the map. However, it is absolutely valide if she believes that it doesn't make sense to her personnally anymore, but the two shouldn't be confused."
906,2020-08-20 17:43:33,id9nnh,"you can tell who watched the video and who didn't. she's not ""shitting on"" Younger Now, she's saying after Bangerz and Dead Petz, Younger Now was kind of a random direction to go into, and that was heavily influenced by her relationship. find me evidence where she says it's bad or she doesn't like it."
907,2020-08-20 14:45:55,id9nnh,Is there anything more predictable than Miley shitting on her previous era when she starts a new one? It‚Äôs a tradition at this point. She says every previous album wasn‚Äôt representative of who she really is and the new one is the real her.
908,2020-08-20 14:03:24,id9nnh,"I do think what she's saying makes sense. But theres a fine line between ""losing yourself"" in someone else and being madly in love. I think it's hard to look back and say ""I was so in love!"" so instead you might think ""wow, I really lost myself in that relationship"". It can even be a bit of both. But love is a beautiful thing. Doesn't always last, but its freeing when you get to the point where you can look back and ENJOY those memories for what they were instead of shutting it down as a mistake."
909,2020-08-20 14:24:45,id9nnh,I don't mind when an artist says these things as long as she doesn't make people feel bad for liking and still listening to her past music. That's my only concern when it comes to moments like this but she doesn't seem to be making people feel bad for liking and listening to her other stuff so I think it's fine.
910,2020-08-20 19:10:36,id9nnh,"I do love her admitting to losing herself to Liam, because that‚Äôs what I was saying at the time. Younger Now is the same as her bun era where she was quiet on social media for a year or 2. 

She believes the way she acted was disingenuous from who she actually is an artist, and maybe even as a person.

I hope she never gets back with Liam, these problems may not be his fault but I do think that he is the contributing factor."

916,2020-08-20 15:27:33,id9nnh,"oh so an album is definitely coming now I'm sure

Also in five years she'll be saying the same about midnight sky üíÄ"
917,2020-08-20 15:17:57,id9nnh,"Miley girl, which era do you not end up hating? lmao"
918,2020-08-20 17:58:56,id9nnh,"Malibu is one of my favorite Miley Cyrus songs/moments. I was never a huge fan of Bangerz, so her revisiting her girl next door image/vibe was so exciting for me. I think she was also at her most beautiful during this era. Idk I liked it! I wish Younger Now was more like Golden Hour tho."
919,2020-08-20 20:28:56,id9nnh,Malibu is a career highlight tho
920,2020-08-20 22:04:08,id9nnh,"Well it seems it was not s moment most pleasing to her in her career, along with literally everything else she has released."
921,2020-08-21 06:04:00,id9nnh,"She needs to stop bashing her own damn eras.  *Younger Now* was a good album.  Girl needs to stand by her work.  At the time, it was what she needed to write."
922,2020-08-20 17:24:03,id9nnh,"serious question. why do so many fans think it's disrespectful for artists to distance themselves for previous work? i get it if the previous work is removed from streaming or otherwise made inaccessible, but if you can still listen to the music what's the big deal? saying that they don't love that era now doesn't mean that they didn't at the time, like how breaking up with someone doesn't cancel out the good times in the relationship (weird analogy but it's all i can come up with)."
923,2020-08-20 16:30:23,id9nnh,She always does this. I don‚Äôt understand why she can‚Äôt just realize that she evolved and changes and that it made sense for her to do the things she did in those times of her life?
924,2020-08-20 17:45:53,id9nnh,I loved this album ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
925,2020-08-20 19:28:28,id9nnh,Where I can watch the full interview
926,2020-08-20 23:09:54,id9nnh,lol what's new?
927,2020-08-21 01:55:02,id9nnh,"Thank god. Younger Now was a sever misstep, but her biggest issue has been her callous dissavowals of her past eras. She's talented and should have stayed on top longer, but her failure to embrace her past hurts her to this day. 

Dead Petz was a fun detour and I disagree with people who thought that it was a career killer. It was fun and made interesting. She really killed her good will with Younger Now and the disastrous interviews surrounding it. 

Hannah Montana made Miley a literal superstar. She never needed to disavow it because her fame exceeded the show itself. Was it band management? Bad agent? Bad record label? I still believe there is time for Miley to make a comeback, but she needs to remember what her successful to begin with. She already has the package, she just needs to be smarter about it."
928,2020-08-21 12:38:02,id9nnh,Inspired is still one of my favorite songs ever
929,2020-08-20 15:20:01,id9nnh,Doesn‚Äôt she just say this about everything that flops?
930,2020-08-20 14:57:44,id9nnh,"I hate that she says this. It‚Äôs so obnoxious. Like girl you didn‚Äôt hate it when the album gave you millions of dollars. And I‚Äôm sorry but that haircut is atrocious. 

It‚Äôs so hard for me to respect an artist who bashes their previous work. Ariana does the same thing with My Everything and DW and I‚Äôm like girl why. Those 2 albums solidified your career at least fake that you like them lol."
931,2020-08-20 15:58:14,id9nnh,"lol... it would have made sense if she didnt backtrack her image and ""growth"" so suddenly like a few months later"
932,2020-08-20 19:10:49,id9nnh,"I kinda dislike when people do this.

However I think everyone should voice their opinions and if you don‚Äôt like era or project you did then say it. I don‚Äôt think you should hold back. And this is 

It really kind of irks me when musicians disown their past works. Because even if you don‚Äôt like it, it‚Äôs still an era that made people fall in love with you and they might have a strong connection with. Hearing the musician not like it ruins it a bit

Like when Ariana said she hated a lot of tracks on My Everything. It makes it hard as a listener to revisit these tracks knowing Ariana didn‚Äôt like them. And some songs like Why Try were was made me love Ariana.

Like when Miley said she didn‚Äôt like Party In The USA and she never heard a Jay-Z song. It just made the song a little less special. 

And sure this is silly because I can still enjoy it even if the musician didn‚Äôt like it."
933,2020-08-21 08:13:57,id9nnh,"I‚Äôm glad she said it. As someone who has always loved miley being a rebel and leaning into her whackiness, seeing her be so plain and vanilla was gut wrenching. Hate the album."
934,2020-08-23 03:02:16,id9nnh,"I still love Malibu and Younger Now. The rest of the album was okay and was really a more of please get back me Liam record than anything else. It served its purpose I suppose.

Ilove this new slide away/midnight sky as its a perfect mix between country and pop miley with some rock. That is her perfect niche, tbh"
935,2020-08-20 14:30:55,id9nnh,.m
936,2020-08-20 14:16:50,id9nnh,I wouldn‚Äôt blame her for shittalking Don‚Äôt Call Me Angel tho
937,2020-08-20 17:12:31,id9nnh,as long as she leaves slide away alone she's fine
938,2020-08-20 17:53:44,id9nnh,"i know it‚Äôs kind of a joke at this point but is Miley reflecting on how she was blinded by love & doing basically anything for her partner despite knowing it wasn‚Äôt working & trying to translate that into her music-but failing-really ‚Äúshit talking‚Äù her music? 

i know, she retracts her previous era‚Äôs a LOT lol but i can‚Äôt blame her for not thinking it‚Äôs a good representation of her. that whole time in her life was the beginning of the end of her relationship. it‚Äôs extremely sad. she thought she was so happy & was making an album full of songs of nostalgia & love but it was all surface level. nobody truly knows what went on between miley & liam but the way miley talks about it, you can kinda tell that she was trying to make things last & make things work despite knowing they weren‚Äôt going to make it. you can even hear that in the music. slide away is that sentiment.

anyway i know i just rambled on & im probably taking the comments a little too seriously but it makes me sad that people are gonna shit on miley for saying this as if she‚Äôs trash talking all that music she made when she‚Äôs not. she just is realizing that none of it was representative of that time. it was all a facade & of course it would upset her to look back on it"
939,2020-08-20 17:33:01,id9nnh,"although she isn't saying it's bad, just that the trajectory of her career was influenced by her relationship"
940,2020-08-20 19:05:21,id9nnh,"So you're the same person as 3 years ago? She didn't shit-talk. She doesn't feel as connected to that era because of Liam. Liam told her to clean her image and she wasn't as focused as other eras and btw, Liam always talks shit about Miley when he is the one doing drugs. That's why she didn't tour. In an interview, she said she was grateful for Hannah Montana and Bangerz. Check your facts before you comment."
941,2020-08-20 17:00:50,id9nnh,because she is awful and she knows it
942,2020-08-20 13:42:30,id9nnh,"Same here, that album for me hits so many good summer vibes and already evokes a little nostalgia for me."
943,2020-08-20 14:04:17,id9nnh,"Same, loved Younger Now. The sound suited her so well."
944,2020-08-20 16:32:37,id9nnh,Younger Now was an incredible song!
945,2020-08-21 04:38:47,id9nnh,she's just saying she doesnt like it because of Liam
946,2020-08-20 17:38:17,id9nnh,"she embraces her songs a lot at times (especially the Hannah stuff recently, but she also played a rockier version of Party in the USA on the Dead Petz tour) but i feel like her critiquing her music spreads way faster than her appreciating her old music"
947,2020-08-20 13:23:34,id9nnh,She's about to denounce Midnight Sky
948,2020-08-20 17:34:05,id9nnh,she's not really denouncing it as much as she's just saying sonically it was a left turn from where she was going
949,2020-08-20 14:19:24,id9nnh,"On one level, it's worthy of respect she did exactly what she wanted with *Dead Petz* and wasn't pressured into making a *Bangerz* 2 to sustain her success. However, she would be the biggest star in the world if she'd properly followed up on *Bangerz* with a pop album (just like you mention Ariana did), and it's such wasted potential.

I'm still waiting to hear the Miley music that sounds like country Lana with a choir on background vocals, that Mike WiLL played to a music journalist a few years ago."
950,2020-08-20 17:36:10,id9nnh,I actually liked that she preferred to make the music she wanted rather than the music she thought everyone else wanted. Dead Petz is the shit.
951,2020-08-20 13:07:00,id9nnh,Joanne made me a fan. ü§°
952,2020-08-20 13:12:46,id9nnh,I think what she means is that she was trying to be someone she is not during that era in order to stay happy in her marriage bc Liam did not like Miley being her crazy weird true self.
953,2020-08-20 14:20:34,id9nnh,*Younger Now* was much more cynical than *Joanne*. Gaga didn't sell out her previous electronic pop music just to sell her new analogue stuff like Miley did.
954,2020-08-21 04:41:21,id9nnh,"Exactly. She's just trying to detach from that era because it was very tied to Liam, but can't put it as clear as you just said it."
955,2020-08-21 06:28:20,id9nnh,"The thing is, Malibu was successful and probably would‚Äôve debuted top 5 had it been released in the tracking week. Why did they just drop the ball on the rest of that rollout."
956,2020-08-21 01:58:14,id9nnh,"I disagree. It was a huge mistake. It has the weakest songs of her career. Miley has always sold lots of records, it was the first time she had legitimately flopped."
957,2020-08-20 14:16:11,id9nnh,She hasn‚Äôt left that list in ages
958,2020-08-23 03:03:13,id9nnh,"Honestly, this so much. It was a solid vanilla album that she did to win back Liam I felt and Malibu is a great song."
959,2020-08-23 03:09:43,id9nnh,"Its honestly so tiring, just say your growing as an artist, Miley."
960,2020-08-20 19:12:45,id9nnh,Nope. She dragged Bangerz much harder.
961,2020-08-20 15:13:25,id9nnh,"
>Like girl you didn‚Äôt hate it when the album gave you millions of dollars.

Younger Now made millions of dollars? Maybe in some other currency."
962,2020-08-20 16:13:38,id9nnh,"This feels like an oddly personal attack, especially the haircut part. Drag me for saying this all you want, but mullets are great and are rightfully becoming this year's trend.

Also, earning money from one of your projects doesn't automatically mean you cannot voice negative opinions about it later on. It's your own work after all and it often happens that people change their minds about what they've created in the past. What might seem like your best work when you share it with the world, might become your least favourite in the future. Whether that be because of personal events or whatever doesn't matter, it's fully understandable.

You can still like their work. It's really no problem..."
963,2020-08-20 17:20:41,id9nnh,"artists can not like their previous music but still appreciate what they did for their career. ariana didn't bash ME and DW, she said they were albums of hits made for her to boost her career, and that's why she isn't as attached to them. it makes complete sense that she'd prefer her later albums she had more of a hand in creating, and it doesn't mean you aren't allowed to like them. it's not that deep."
964,2020-08-20 15:53:10,id9nnh,"I didn't know she slammed DW. Seriously, that's the album that made me an Ariana fan. ""Into You"" is the perfect pop song. I wasn't much a fan of Thank You, Next. I feel it doesn't have longevity and was clearly chasing trends."
965,2020-08-20 18:38:25,id9nnh,It tanked what are you on about üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
966,2020-08-20 19:51:42,id9nnh,">It really kind of irks me when musicians disown their past works.

there's a big difference between disowning past work and saying they don't vibe with it any more though. in this video, miley said that YN was a random direction after the two previous albums, and that it was heavily influenced by her relationship. that's not disowning her past work at all."
967,2020-08-20 21:50:48,id9nnh,Lana has tried to erase that song from existence I‚Äôm sure üíÄ
968,2020-08-20 14:21:41,id9nnh,I liked it
969,2020-08-21 07:53:54,id9nnh,that song was messy gold shhhhh
970,2020-08-21 01:23:59,id9nnh,"I'mma be honest, I can't speak for every artist, but just as someone who writes and produces, it's REALLY easy to want to disavow/ignore music I've made 2 years, 3 years, hell even 8 months ago. When you make stuff sometimes you're in a very specific frame of mind and when you're no longer there (because people change so quickly) it's SO easy to be like ""I don't resonate with that anymore, that's not me"". So I actually get why Miley would disavow each era as time goes on. Tack that with her previous relationship...oxytocin can make you do inauthentic shit..."
971,2020-08-20 17:30:27,id9nnh,Literally who asked? Please shut your hater ass up and gtfo.
972,2020-08-20 13:44:06,id9nnh,"2023, wait for it"
973,2020-08-20 17:47:46,id9nnh,I was only half serious.
974,2020-08-20 19:05:29,id9nnh,"To call Miley, someone who has been working since she was 12 and was more successful by 16 than most pop acts will ever be, ‚Äúwastes potential‚Äù is ludicrous by every metric. 

By the time We Can‚Äôt Stop released, Miley Cyrus was a household name and could have retired from music.

The reality for someone as cemented as Miley in the music industry is she really doesn‚Äôt have to cater to radio, trends, or social media memes for people to buy the music. Not to say everything she does will go #1, but if she never had a hit again, it wouldn‚Äôt detract from her career."
975,2020-08-20 15:54:08,id9nnh,Her mistakes are better than my best efforts so
976,2020-09-03 07:45:47,id9nnh,"Late to this comment, but I agree wholeheartedly with everything you said! Loooove Dead Petz so much too, it has some of my favourite Miley songs of her career"
977,2020-08-20 13:27:30,id9nnh,"It's a good album, don't listen to them"
978,2020-08-20 15:34:41,id9nnh,"me too, you're not alone haha"
979,2020-08-20 13:57:14,id9nnh,"Personnally it was lost on me, but I don't exactly have strong feelings about it either"
980,2020-08-20 15:29:30,id9nnh,"Omg me too, like I loved some singles like Judas or GUY and I liked her antics but Joanne made me a fan. It's her best album"
981,2020-08-20 13:23:19,id9nnh,But she says this with every single album right?
982,2020-08-20 17:55:10,id9nnh,"Not going to invalidate anything she might feel or have felt during a relationship I know nothing about, but  what I was trying to express is that sometimes with Miley, it feels like because she is evolving as a person and having insights about herself which are different from album to album, she feels the need to dismiss the music she put out earlier and the career moves she made just because she personnally changed. No other pop star goes around diminishing or shrugging off their past eras like Miley does, which kind of breaks the popstar illusion. Though going a little bit deeper, I can see why she might have a hard time dissociating her popstar persona during each era from her own self, considering the fact that she spent a lot of her younger years acting in a tv show which played with the popstar identity on several levels (honestly who puts a teenage girl in a show where she plays a character named just like her, whose father is played by her own, and grooms her into a popstar while she herself plays a hidden-identity popstar...)"
983,2020-08-20 13:30:09,id9nnh,">Liam did not like Miley being her crazy weird true self. 

What evidence do you have to support this statement?"
984,2020-08-20 17:33:21,id9nnh,Let's say it was more of a comparison in terms of career move than it was an analogy.
985,2020-08-21 08:30:35,id9nnh,"Just as I explained, the record makes sense, it's just a bad album. If you want me to rephrase it, the idea of the era is coherent with her career, but it failed because the execution was poor, music-wise."
986,2020-08-20 17:17:50,id9nnh,"she didn't slam DW, OP is exaggerating. i don't remember her exact words but she's basically said that DW was deliberately made to be an album of hits to boost her career and the songs aren't necessarily personal to her, which is true. her feelings about My Everything are probably similar. sweetener is the album where she got more involved in the songwriting/production side so it makes sense that she'd feel more emotionally attached to sweetener/tu,n."
987,2020-08-21 00:21:28,id9nnh,I think her part is the best part in the song tho
988,2020-08-21 08:17:24,id9nnh,she tried manifesting to erase it
989,2020-08-20 17:54:14,id9nnh,"i LIKED it too lol

key word tho. it got stale after a month"
990,2020-08-20 20:26:46,id9nnh,"Tbr if an artist defaces their own music, it‚Äôs fair game for everyone else to pipe in with their own opinion. Miley does this every single time she has a flop era which is every single era since 2014."
991,2020-08-20 17:38:01,id9nnh,"lmao get a grip, someone doesn't like the same pop star as you. don't lose sleep over it, not even she likes her own music."
992,2020-08-20 17:51:24,id9nnh,"fair enough, it just kinda bugs me how much shit artists get for expressing their thoughts on their own work unless it's strictly positive"
993,2020-08-20 18:42:22,id9nnh,"You don‚Äôt have the same resources wealth and status provide so don‚Äôt be so hard on yourself. 

That‚Äôs not knocking Miley, but fr."
994,2020-08-20 13:58:25,id9nnh,Lyrically I think it's ze of her best. Joanne (title track) has a lot of layers to it. Deserves better.
995,2020-08-20 13:42:26,id9nnh,"Not OP, but that statement sounded familiar and in a very fast search I found this quote in a [People article](https://people.com/music/miley-cyrus-not-happy-liam-hemsworth-partying/) from last August and it's the closest thing I can find about not liking her party side;

> Meanwhile, a friend of Cyrus says the couple struggled over the singer‚Äôs unconventional view of marriage. ‚ÄúHe loves that she has her own career and focus, but he also wants a wife who cooks and would stay home with the kids,‚Äù says the friend.

So seems like he wanted someone more housewifey.

But the article is titled Liam Hemsworth Would 'Lash Out' at Miley Cyrus, Who Wasn't Happy with His Partying: Sources, so seems like Miley didn't like his wild side? I don't know why I'm even wasting time on this. God, I need the weekend."
996,2020-08-20 14:16:46,id9nnh,Did you watch the interview? She said she changed for him...
997,2020-08-20 13:46:07,id9nnh,Watch the video on this post tho
998,2020-08-20 13:39:20,id9nnh,Literally having eyes
999,2020-08-21 17:54:44,id9nnh,"I see what you mean now, and I agree. I'm surprised that the label didn't intervene. It was horrible."
1000,2020-08-21 06:27:30,id9nnh,"‚ÄúI pick it up, I drop it down, I back it off the county line‚Äù"
1001,2020-08-22 04:15:14,id9nnh,Her lyrics were awful and made no sense. All of the lyrics were terrible though tbh
1002,2020-08-20 20:30:53,id9nnh,"That‚Äôs a fair analysis, and y‚Äôall‚Äôre free to give your own hot takes, but saying, ‚Äúbecause she is awful and she knows it‚Äù just isn‚Äôt it. It‚Äôs such a hateful way to frame an otherwise acceptable statement. Why not just say, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs self critical.‚Äù? I just don‚Äôt get it."
1003,2020-08-20 17:44:09,id9nnh,Why are you so hateful for literally no reason
1004,2020-08-20 17:49:32,id9nnh,[deleted]
1005,2020-08-20 17:31:59,id9nnh,"Admittedly, I got so bored with the music I didn't listen to the lyrics very closely (the only songs I listened to often were John Wayne and Dancing in Circles, which speaks volumes about my tastes). I'll probably revisit it at some point though, and I don't mean to put down anyone who loves it!"
1006,2020-08-20 14:03:14,id9nnh,"Lol so they didn‚Äôt approve of each other‚Äôs wild side? üòÇ

I heard that People Magazine is the most reliable magazine, but it‚Äôs still a tabloid at the end of the day."
1007,2020-08-20 17:40:12,id9nnh,seems like her choice tho. she talked about this being a subconscious thing on the Call Her Daddy podcast
1008,2020-08-20 13:52:20,id9nnh,"I watched it, but she didn‚Äôt talk about Liam not liking her true self. Not to say that it couldn‚Äôt be true, but it‚Äôs a generalization to make from a few seconds of an interview. She said that she lost herself in the relationship."
1009,2020-08-20 13:40:41,id9nnh,"Okay, so zero evidence."

1011,2020-08-22 06:10:26,id9nnh,Well her lyrics was over the place in that collab but for me she is the best part in it.
1012,2020-08-20 17:47:30,id9nnh,calling a popstar (who routinely denounces her own work) awful is hateful?
1013,2020-08-20 17:52:33,id9nnh,no kidding
1014,2020-08-21 04:43:48,id9nnh,"well, they knew each other at a really young age, in the stage of a movie..."
1015,2020-08-20 14:02:07,id9nnh,"I think they‚Äôre more private about their life than we think. The only thing we see is what they show. And gathering the pieces of what miley has shown, how she was after their first breakup, and then when they were together again, and now after the second breakup, and even by everything on the media, it all kind of corroborates to this way of thinking. 

We‚Äôre also not saying he‚Äôs a monster that tried to control her. They had just different ways of living life, and that got on the way, and she lost a bit of herself trying to keep it together. Maybe he did too, but he‚Äôs a way less public person and we never got to see his side."
1016,2020-08-20 13:41:49,id9nnh,Google is free.

1022,2020-08-20 08:51:08,id6a7g,It‚Äôs really embarrassing when wannabe celebrities go off on their ‚Äúhaters‚Äù because actual celebrities do not do that. It‚Äôs literally impossible to be in the public eye without people saying shit about you that you don‚Äôt like it‚Äôs part of the job.
1023,2020-08-20 11:48:37,id6a7g,"A problem is that alex puts on this persona of being confident, or bring a boss or a bad bitch and giving no fucks about what ppl think about her. But her recent actions are clearly showing that's not the case. Don't get me wrong there's nothing wrong with how she's feeling, the problem is how she's responding to the hate and critics...... Just ignore us like other celebs do."
1024,2020-08-20 12:52:03,id6a7g,It kinda made me sad because I know there are people on here that say negative things but  I‚Äôm just on here for the tips/advice and stories..I‚Äôm not a hater at all but now feel like I‚Äôm guilty by association :(
1025,2020-08-20 13:51:25,id66ah,"I think a lot of people have been here since before the podcast was just Alex. They are or were fans but as Alex has gone on her own I think people‚Äôs disappointment with her has grown. A lot of people  have valid criticisms - want different content and don‚Äôt like influencers. And then I think some people are just realizing how Alex doesn‚Äôt work as well on her own or she doesn‚Äôt provide what a lot of people initially liked the show for. I think this all came to a head when Alex interviewed Miley Cyrus. That interview did show a lack of interview skills that IMO is undeniable. Though I think she can definitely work and improve on those skills. 

Ultimately - A lot of people are voicing their frustrations with a podcast they loved turn into something they really don‚Äôt enjoy."
1026,2020-08-20 15:37:31,id66ah,It was going downhill but then escalated when Alex was called out for not following Covid precautions and she told people to go fuck themselves.
1027,2020-08-20 11:40:26,id66ah,"Like any fanbase there are ppl who are shit heels and are outwardly hateful and mean. But there are also ppl who still like the podcast but have become critical of what the show has become now. I've been listening to the podcast since it started and I've enjoyed it. But being critical and wanting better from alex doesn't mean I hate her or the podcast. I think she needs to get some tougher skin, cuz this is what happens when you're in the public eye. Or she should just stay off reddit and ignore the comments, because fact of the matter is even though we are fans she doesn't owe us shit. But she shouldn't also shit on her fans for how they feel."

1030,2020-08-20 08:32:15,id66ah,"Same, I‚Äôm trying to catch up so I‚Äôm on episode 45 + having listened to the Miley episode. If people don‚Äôt like the podcast, unsubscribe or don‚Äôt listen anymore. It‚Äôs that simple."
1031,2020-08-20 19:33:02,id66ah,Oh wow....
1032,2020-08-20 13:52:55,id66ah,My only thing with these people is when you even try to share positive things you like about the pod or disagree with someone‚Äôs criticism or statement you immediately get downvoted lol so Alex isn‚Äôt completely wrong about the atmosphere of this Reddit :( so I agree she should just stay off because it‚Äôs only been getting worse here.
1033,2020-08-21 01:00:39,id66ah,Me? No lol I was just curious what‚Äôs up but after a lot of what I‚Äôve read I don‚Äôt know if I will listen to the podcasts ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1034,2020-08-20 14:39:38,id66ah,Same people are so negative it‚Äôs draining like this is supposed to be a fun and funny podcast take a fucking seat negative Nancy‚Äôs
1035,2020-08-20 18:23:39,id66ah,SAME SAME. This is common sense... I‚Äôve been saying the same thing and keep getting hella downvotes LOL. Y‚Äôall have the choice to just... move on....
1036,2020-08-20 14:28:24,id66ah,"I disagree. The comments I see with the most upvotes are ones with constructive, helpful criticism. The reddit users here who have been around since the begining are just trying to explain how we are feeling because I believe Alex DOES care how we feel about the pod. I know the recent drama and Miley ep have brought a lot of new listeners who don't understand the roller-coaster of emotions the ""OG CHD gang"" have been through. We welcome the new listeners obviously but also understand they might not know what has gone on to get to the point where we're desperately trying to get through to Alex regarding content."
1037,2020-08-20 14:16:21,id66ah,That's the climate we live in today. Sadly some ppl aren't what enough to know that even though ppl have different opinions it doesn't mean they're bad for having them.
1038,2020-08-20 15:29:07,id66ah,"And if you disagree with the haters, they downvote you. Funny how it went from hating Sofia, to supporting ‚Äúour‚Äù Single Father, to now bashing Alex. 

Like, look...were they ever actually relatable, guys? No! At least not for average or ugly people; truth hurts. They were - and are - two scorchingly hot women. Hot people get treated differently and always will, thus having different life experiences that an average person probably can‚Äôt relate to. 

Alex is becoming more well-known, and is still hot, so she‚Äôs getting to do and experience different things. She‚Äôs living her life, making more money than anyone on this sub (her own money, not talking being born into a trust fund or wealthy family...that would be your parents‚Äô money, not yours) and seems happy to be doing so. People and society love to hate on successful, beautiful women. 

Go start an anti-CHD sub and take your miserable attitudes elsewhere! Get a life of your own that‚Äôs worthy of celebrating instead of being so focused on attacking someone else. Oh, and if you don‚Äôt like the podcast anymore, then stop fucking listening and go do something worthwhile with your time and energy. 

At the end of the day, NONE of this shit really matters and has ZERO impact on your life."
1039,2020-08-20 14:31:08,id66ah,That‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm getting at though. I completely understand constructive criticism and I thoroughly enjoy those conversations where people go back and forth without being rude/aggressive if we disagree on a topic. But if you have something nice to say about the pod or Alex / you don‚Äôt completely agree with someone‚Äôs criticism you immediately get downvoted for doing so and it fosters an environment where you feel like you also can‚Äôt say positive things or enjoy certain aspects of the pod either on this sub.
1040,2020-08-20 14:42:59,id66ah,"I recently posted that I really enjoy the ""Questions of the Week"" segment of the pod because it reminds me of when I used to absolutly LOVE the show. A lot of people upvoted the comment and it was CHD/Alex-positive. I just might not be seeing the same comments you have been seeing I suppose. 

I feel like I see a lot of venting on the subreddit right now. If you want to post something about how much you love the pod, I'd do it. Whether people upvote you like crazy or downvote you like crazy, it doesnt really matter because everyone will have different opinions."
1041,2020-08-20 16:43:03,id66ah,"You‚Äôll tend to see it in more of the ‚Äúconstructive‚Äù or critical posts. And there‚Äôs plenty of them that overcrowd everything else. 

My problem isn‚Äôt that we can or cannot or should or shouldn‚Äôt care I just think it‚Äôs fostering a really toxic environment when I feel like this community wasn‚Äôt about that prior to the new era in terms of how people spoke to each other. It‚Äôs actually surprising and nice when you can have a constructive and respectful convo about shit even when you disagree with each other instead of getting downvoted!

1107,2020-09-08 04:52:21,io92pn,I think this is the incorrect approach. Let her find her own way and focus instead on practicing what you preach. She has a literal farm...she has shown time and time again she does love animals...I feel she is compassionate and my impression is she is trying to find her own way. She isn't in any way relishing the idea of abandoning veganism...in fact in the podcast she seems literally emotionally pained by the idea. If veganism didn't work for her...she's a grown woman who is capable of making her own decisions and I appreciate that she was honest about the difficulties on the diet...she was willing to take the heat and admit outright where she stands. Maybe she'll switch it up and return...which would be more likely if we are respectful towards her. For example...we could provide evidence of plant based omegas instead of fish.
1108,2020-09-07 16:50:31,io92pn,"But the simple fact is that fish are nutritious for human consumption. Vegans do not eat fish because it is cruel, not because they are somehow bad for you. Pretending that animal products aren't naturally consumed by humans is unhelpful to the vegan cause.

Edit: A lot of people getting downvoted for stating facts in this thread... you want peer-reviewed articles literally go to google scholar and type fish nutrition humans and you will find hundreds. This is why omnivores don't listen to vegans. The actual facts are reason enough to go vegan. Stick to them."

No. Just no.

This is true if you only ever eat raw fish straight from the ocean, but otherwise not true at all. Cooking fish would kill all parasites, as well as freezing it for a week at -20¬∞C.

Yes fish does contain Mercury.

You can fill that 20% with vegan junky food or animal products. I obviously would prefer people eat the vegan junk food.

But vegans often spread misinformation about animal products. A mostly whole foods plant based diet is healthiest, but then I've heard vegans say shit like 'eating an egg is equivalent to smoking a pack of cigarettes.' Nah if you eat mostly whole foods 1 egg a week will not take years off your life.

I'm sorry to hear that. Don't eat too much ice-cream :p make some vegan cheese sauce and use carrots .. it's tasty af and doesn't harm your health in the same way I guess

I was quite sad to hear her response in the Joe Rogan podcast. She didn't mention one supplement for her problem. So did she even try something before going omnislut again? I guess not

And there's a video from 'happy healthy vegan' in which he talks about how she literally sounds like a non vegan when it comes to nutrition. https://youtu.be/DCBWmn7BscM

Earthling Ed also made a response video!

Stay healthy :)"

1309,2020-10-09 23:59:09,j89irt,"i read a comment someone on here said a while ago, that they thought she/her team just threw it out there like they've been doing and were unprepared for it actually connecting. hence releasing the covers, backyard sessions, etc., stalling until more material basically. and i think that theory makes sense"
1310,2020-10-10 00:22:06,j89irt,"She did make a comment that she didn‚Äôt want to release an album until the pandemic is over a couple of weeks back.

But also it‚Äôs 2020, while I personally do love the album format, I think it makes sense to release loose singles. Song writing is hard, you‚Äôre gonna write a zillion bad tracks for every good one and if she has one good one and a ton of things she thinks isn‚Äôt up to snuff it makes sense to throw the one out into the world."
1311,2020-10-10 01:20:50,j89irt,Honestly I‚Äôm here for it. Her eras since *Bangerz* have been a shitshow but she‚Äôs had some incredible singles. I‚Äôm cool with her being a singles artist.
1312,2020-10-10 00:16:09,j89irt,"I think it could be more that the status and budget of her album very much depends on the single's success to see if there's still any interest in Miley, and what markets are responding to this project, so they can market the album accordingly"

1314,2020-10-10 04:07:44,j89irt,she has an entire album that is completed that she hasn‚Äôt released so it‚Äôs definitely not for lack of material.
1315,2020-10-10 00:38:56,j89irt,"I lowkey hope she rethinks the whole ""I will wait until after the pandemic"" thing because I dont see this situation ending anytime soon :/"
1316,2020-10-10 04:10:02,j89irt,she didn‚Äôt say she was going to wait until the pandemic was over she said she wanted to release it when ppl can get together and dance to it. she obviously means playing shows but if shows aren‚Äôt coming back in the foreseeable future she will probably go ahead and release it.

1363,2020-10-09 13:54:00,j7xivh,They use the sm7b screen for instruments?
1364,2020-10-11 11:56:13,j7xivh,why did this get removed?  for safety and being civil? THATS SOME BS! cudoos on them pussy farts ;)
1365,2020-10-09 18:04:10,j7t83v,Pretty safe to say Billy Gibbons. I‚Äôd wager Charlize Theron is also going to be their guest considering how hard she fanned for them during the Atomic Blonde press circuit (https://www.facebook.com/fox4kc/videos/10155102395208645/?vh=e&extid=0).
1366,2020-10-09 14:47:19,j7t83v,"Billy Gibbons once cited ""Some Great Reward"" as one of his favorite albums. It would be a weird choice, but who knows?"
1367,2020-10-10 05:49:37,j7t83v,Dave Ghrol did the drums on NINs WithTeeth  as well as a few tracks on the first of the Trilogy eps . Will he and Miley announce NIN ? ( She sang reworked NIN songs on a Black Mirror Episode and has performed her version at her shows .
1368,2020-10-17 19:24:38,j7t83v,We don't think Chris Martin? He's got my vote.
1369,2020-10-14 02:13:58,j7t83v,As I was watching Atomic Blonde and loving the music I was thinking ‚Äúthere‚Äôs gotta be a DM song in here!‚Äù Then Behind The Wheel played during a scene and I was stoked af.
1370,2020-10-09 17:57:16,j7t83v,"Yeah, probably gonna be Billy Gibbons. He gushes over DM and has done a remix for them on Soothe My Soul while Dave‚Äôs always seemingly had a real big love for American rock and roll. While it seems odd, it gels."
1371,2020-10-14 02:11:37,j7t83v,Uggh that Miley NIN abomination was horrible.

1421,2020-11-09 11:03:59,jqvf6b,"I think a lot of pop music reviewing is based on artists's image and personal life (probably because its also such a huge part of pop music marketing). Since Miley has kind of flip-flopped from one era to another, disavows her past albums and constantly changes up her style and sound, it's harder to get a read on what each album means for her trajectory as an artist."
1422,2020-11-09 10:54:08,jqvf6b,I don‚Äôt think she ever invested that much in campaigning to get critical acclaim as much as her peers. And she never seemed to care about it anyways. She grew up in the industry around musical legends so she is probably over the bullshit. I mean... her godmother is Dolly Parton...
1423,2020-11-09 12:52:20,jqvf6b,"Because she has, imo, never made anything with a thesis or thematic statement. I love _Bangerz_. It‚Äôs incredible. Part of what makes it great is how all over the place it is, but what is it trying to _say_? That‚Äôs really it. The same can be said for most of her projects.

It‚Äôs kind of like the Nicki Minaj effect. They‚Äôre fantastic at what they do. They have great voices (or writing/rapping ability, in Nicki‚Äôs case). But at the end of the day, you‚Äôre not honing in on your album‚Äôs statement. People often hit back with ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt have to be political!‚Äù And that‚Äôs not it. It‚Äôs just: Who are you? What‚Äôs the story here? Why did you put these tracks together?

Anyway, I‚Äôm rambling now. But Miley has the talent, she‚Äôs just a little scatter brained. She could secure critical praise if she just focused a bit. That‚Äôs all."

I love Alex but I have no idea why the hell her or barstool would do this. I‚Äôd understand if she took 3-4 weeks off but this is excessive."
1470,2020-11-09 08:35:59,jqr0hy,"I‚Äôve been listening since almost the beginning and they really didn‚Äôt skip at all. I think one year they didn‚Äôt even skip thanksgiving, Christmas, and nye. I remember they skipped the first week covid got really bad here. But Alex has already blown through half of her 12 weeks off and we‚Äôre barely into the new era"

1475,2020-11-09 21:44:19,jqr0hy,Hannah Berner called Alex the female Joe Rogan üòÇüòÇ. Joe Rogan puts out content consistently. Alex doesn‚Äôt have enough content to be at that level. It‚Äôs getting ridiculous.
1476,2020-11-27 01:17:58,jqr0hy,I mean come on it‚Äôs one hour once a week. You should‚Äôve even need off for all these vacations. You work one day or four days a month why take even more ?
1477,2020-11-09 05:08:37,jqr0hy,"In the past when they skipped weeks they would just reupload old episodes. So yes, weeks have been absent"
1478,2020-11-10 01:04:21,jqr0hy,"Also, just because she can skip, doesn‚Äôt mean she should... every successful youtuber/content creater will tell you that the most important thing in growth is consistency in posting"
1479,2020-11-09 13:49:01,jqr0hy,Not sure why this has so many downvotes but yeah they would skip weeks like Thanksgiving and Christmas then just re-upload an old episode with a new updated intro.

Donate to Warnock here: https://secure.actblue.com/donate/wfg-social?refcode=enight

She, amoung others, was responsible for flipping GA blue during the election by registering 800k voters. 

I would also highly recommend reaching out to friends and family in GA to confirm they're registered. Also, anyone who will be 18 when the election happens in January will be eligible to register, even if they're 17 now. December 7th is the final date you can register to vote, December 14th is when early voting begins and the election day is January 5th.

The democrats know it's coming and are mostly sick and tired of ""rules for thee but not for me"" from the republicans. I can't say for sure, unfortunately there are a few democrats who will probably make noise about wanting to keep it, but most of the ones who would be primed to raise that objection might still go along with it if there's some time pressure stopping them from finding an alternative solution. Say, for example, much needed economic stimulus? It may force democrats to make a decision and I'm cautiously optimistic about how that would turn out. We also will need to lobby our senators and assure them that it is actually what the voters want."

For example, I use Spotify, and when I type is Miley Cyrus, the first song that comes up for her is Party In The USA because it‚Äôs her most famous song still. She‚Äôs just released some new music, and is getting ready to release an album, so people are probably looking her up on their streaming service to see her new music, but the first thing that pops up is this old hit that everyone knows and is very nostalgic, so naturally they‚Äôre going to take some time to listen to that too.

I only say this because it‚Äôs exactly what happened to me so I am sure I can‚Äôt be alone in that. 


Also though, people are celebrating the election and that is a very ‚Äúhappy‚Äù USA song so that could have to do with it. Now that I say that, maybe people are saying ‚ÄúBye Bye Bye‚Äù to Trump?"

There's a pretty cool documentary about it on YouTube called Boy Band Con: The Lou Pearlman Story. Lance Bass actually gives his input about the whole situation. It's really fascinating.

That Joe Biden would be

The next leader of the USA.

Called him sleepy Joe,

Still Joe got the votes

Meanwhile Joe got votes; and they weren't stopping cause

So go tell Donny

GO TELL DONNY





I can't believe Don thought he'd win this, 

When over half the nation's so pissed! 

Donald's attorney's on the phone,

""sue them all"" Donny moans, 

""it's election fraud,"" Donny is sobbing.






Donny didnt know

Donny didnt know

Donny didnt know

Go tell Donny cause

Donny didnt know! 





The orange beast, we stopped. 

Its so cool Joe's out on top. 

The white house lawn, in the snow.

The swearing in, when

Donny has to go.

Finally will go! 







Donny has to go

Donny has to go

Donny has to go

So go tell Donny. 

Bet he'll put on a show,

Whine and refuse to go!

Gotta tell Donny

Gonna tell him myself

We were mocking him because every time he plays a song the artists issue a cease-and-desist. So now he's stuck with YMCA.

Meanwhile Biden has the Beastie Boys*, Eminem, Mary J. Blige, Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty, Avicii and basically every younger artist either featured in his ads or on his side.

Donald Trump also has famous musical haters like Mac Miller and Nipsey Hussle. As well as some downright [laughable supporters](https://loudwire.com/trapt-singer-twitter-meltdown/)

* the whole verse is basically one note, making it extremely easy to sing even by tone-challenged voices.

* The chorus is not that that different, still very easy to sing, ending with a powerful belt-able line.

* The above two points can be summarised, as others aptly did, in *""I can sing it when I'm drunk""*.

* There is no drop in energy anywhere for the whole duration song, from the continuous guitar arpeggio ostinato to the relentless distorted bass to the alternating 16-beat drumming of the verses to unashamed crash galop in the choruses. You can literally jump for 3 minutes and a half non-stop if you want (maybe with the exception of the pre-""I never"" part).

It's just so artificial - the songstresses in question never went through that. Not with their parents and their resources. They sing about it to seem relatable but it just rings hollow.

But Party in the U.S.A. is about her first trip to Hollywood, and dealing with being a fish out of water in a place *in a way that makes sense for someone like her*.

It may be all imaginary, but it definitely feels more authentic than a lot of pop songs I've heard, and I like it a lot for that reason."

This list is too long but I would feel bad without the honorable artist mentions of Lady Gaga, Rihanna, Beyonce, Ed Sheeran, Katy Perry, Billie Eilish and there's more I'm simply forgetting.

Leftists are a big part of the group that won. We cannot call you liberals anymore as you don't support liberal policies only over-regulation and over-reach by the government.   


I don't expect you to know the difference though. Smug mofo.   


The only smug attitude given in 2016 was after being called racist and bigots for how we vote. Being demonized by a small group who subsequently gets fucked on is always satisfying.

Hes hardly pro-immigration has stood against gay marriage, picks fights with supporters who ask him hard questions, has said seriously prejudice statements one of which was on Sway in the Morning. Both parties have tried hiding very concerning bits of legislation inside of bills that were unrelated. For example was when part of ""The Squad"" tried shoehorning in lowering the voting age when they tried passing The Green New Deal. Not to mention many democrats were also on Epstein's flight logs.

Two wings to the same bird. At least some liberals understand that issue and push for the Green Party. I can respect that even though I disagree with the Green Party heavily. At least they're actively trying to topple the two party system that is quite literally plaguing this country. Which is something we all know is a problem. The difference is who is brave enough to challenge it."

3074,2020-11-09 08:16:04,jqnl1p,"Arizona, among others, is going to be recounted at the pace it's on. And if Trump's legal team can target invalid mail-in ballots, that will negatively affected Biden. Throw in the yet-to-be called North Carolina and Alaska (which Trump is winning handily) and all of a sudden Trump is at 243. Georgia is confirmed to be subjected to a recount. Again, courts pending, it could also swing for Trump putting him at 259.

Then, it comes down Pennsylvania and its 20 votes. The Supreme Court provisionally allowed ballots to be counted if they arrived before Friday, Nov. 6, and were postmarked before Election Day, Nov. 3, and ordered late votes to be segregated. When Justice Samuel Alito was informed that the state had not segregated the late votes, as Pennsylvania‚Äôs secretary of the commonwealth¬†[had advised](https://local21news.com/news/local/supreme-court-tells-pa-counties-to-segregate-any-ballots-received-after-8pm-on-electi), Alito¬†[made it an order](https://www.westernjournal.com/justice-alito-steps-orders-pa-votes-received-8-p-m-election-day-secured/)¬†on Friday.
Biden currently leads by 37,000 votes in Pennsylvania. The number of late-arriving ballots likely far exceeds this total (the state has not published this information). Justice Alioto and a Court majority may throw out the late ballots, likely delivering the state and victory to Trump at 289 electoral votes.

You have to remember that while everyone was busy making fun of Trump over the last four years, he's been stacking the courts with over 200 judges, and it just so happens his two Supreme Court appointees (Kavanaugh and ACB) were part of [Bush's legal team](https://www.abc57.com/news/supreme-court-is-about-to-have-3-bush-v-gore-alumni-sitting-on-the-bench) that won him Florida and the 2000 election. All the people in this thread probably weren't even alive in 2000 lol

So now we have a media apparatus (that got ever single other thing [catastrophically wrong](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/07/election-pollsters-2020-reckoning.html) about the election, whether through incompetence or malice,) telling you not to worry about the election results going to the Supreme Court."

What's wild is how willing people are to bend over backwards for a party that has quite literally listened to what you had to say and flat out told you they dont care.

States that we don't typically associate with slavery, like Maryland and Delaware, were major slave states prior to the civil war.](https://faculty.weber.edu/kmackay/statistics_on_slavery.htm)

If you actually look at primary sources for populations you can see that in 1790 Electoral College prevents power from being consolidated into the state that had the highest population and by far the most slaves, Virginia.

 If some candidate comes in and has big plans based mostly on interests of big city people, and plans on ruining important parts of rural industry, it would also be kind of unfair.

If there's ""plenty of evidence"" why are so many of these lawsuits getting dismissed due to lack of evidence?

> some of it has been resolved with reasonable explanations

Like what? The agreement in Philly for where poll watchers from both parties could stand... which resulted in them counting all the ballots and Biden taking the lead? Yes, that was a reasonable compromise and nothing in that agreement alleged or found fraud.

> for a group of people who have been screeching about Russian interference for four years straight your faith in the election process sure seems to have changed rather dramatically and rather quickly

Claims of Russian  interference were backed up by every American intelligence agency. That said, it's never been claimed that Russians hacked into voting machines and actively changed votes, just that they pushed a ton of disinformation on social media. 

Claims of widespread voter fraud so far have been backed up by screengrabs on Twitter and nothing in court.

No.  

1. The *type* of birds killed differ, with wind turbines killing larger and at-risk species.

2. Wind turbines also kill bats, being the single largest threat to bat colonies behind the White Nose Syndrome fungus.

3. If you want to scale up wind power, you need to address those problems, otherwise you're striving for 'clean energy' while slaughtering multiple endangered species.

Firstly we already went over the racism bit and you excused that, now you're excusing the fat shaming bit as well. Just like Trumpers did for Trump. Funny how the tables have turned. Literally the whole ""so Trump is just an asshole, that doesnt make him horrible"" argument is now trickling over to Biden.

>Now you're pushing into conspiracy theory territory. Not giving me much to work with if you're just going to believe things without evidence. Obviously videos of ""the sniffing"" are out there and I've seen them, but the implications of this are pure conspiracy.

Once again a Trumper type argument. I knew you were going to use the ""allegedly"" bit. This is too easy.

>No Knock raids and prosecutors writing their own search warrants is part of the problem but it's not like Biden invented systemic racism.

>Biden has acknowledged some of those polices to be mistakes in the 26 years since they've been written. Yes the 94 bill was a mistake but you act like people aren't capable of changing their opinions.

Only a few decades late and several billion dollars short. Why didn't Obama push to change it when Biden was his VP if he thinks its so bad. Why was it that it took Snowden to get him to ""change his mind?"" Again these shouldn't be things we have to question when we're talking about our president. 

Damn I really feel like I'm talking to a Trump supporter. I'm all ""if thats your standard for good"" and shit. 

>If by awful you mean ""has made mistakes and usually owns up to them"" then I guess he is awful. The conspiracy theories don't even raise an eyebrow for me anymore though. 

Just simply admitting ""my bad"" isnt owning up to a mistake that cost millions of people their lives, privacy, and rights. Not to mention that the bill was propagated by the War on Drugs which heavily preyed on African Americans as well. 

My point being not only has his rhetoric been kinda racist, but his past policy has successfully helped disenfranchise an entire race of people here in the U.S."

Normally, they feel much realer than dreams, and you will find it very hard to forget the smallest detail. If these dreams don't feel any realer than other dreams and you struggle to recall them long after waking, they are not visions - just dreams."

3748,2020-12-16 03:09:03,kdlokc,"I think probably because she's sort of trying to start a ""rock phase"" it seems. She's done some covers of Metallica, Hole and other bands, as well as the album being just an eensy-weensy bit more rock-influenced than her other stuff. I totally agree it's not at all a rock album but it's much more rock-oriented than her other work, I suppose."

3767,2020-12-15 12:47:13,kdhb3s,Welcome to the fandom! I've got a hunch that you'll really like With Teeth as well. Also check out Trent & Atticus' score of Ken Burns' The Vietnam War. It's my favourite ambient stuff from them.
3768,2020-12-15 17:02:50,kdhb3s,Hahah welcome to the club! I'm not even gonna recommend anything in particular just... have fun digging around! There's a LOT of NIN stuff that I think is gonna float your boat :)

I think people slept on it a bit when it first came out because it was written and recorded in such a short amount of time, came out shortly after Ghosts I-IV and Year Zero, and was free digitally, so people just assumed it was kind of a throwaway album. But it‚Äôs really incredible."

3775,2020-12-15 21:11:28,kdglbk,"As a person who has dealt with addiction and who personally still really loves drugs: Sarah Lynn makes doing drugs seem so fucking fun.

I know that's not the takeaway at all and obviously it comes from a place of trauma for her (and for me)

but watching the show reminds me of all the ""fun time"" people I used to hang out with and Sarah Lynn would be the **most** fun.

I know that's a weird take on it."
3776,2020-12-15 11:18:54,kdglbk,"I love Sarah Lynn. I watched Bojack the first time this year and I stocked that after I finished the show that I always thinking about Sarah Lynn. She (to me) stand out of all of the rest of the cast because she so beautiful and broken at the same time. I want to be happy from the love inside but that not mean to be. Hell, I watched Gravity Falls so I can imagine what life Sarah Lynn can have if your mum didn‚Äôt force her to do Horsin‚Äô around. I didn‚Äôt feel something for a character like Sarah Lynn since watching Neon Genesis Evangelion with Asuka."
3777,2020-12-16 01:32:15,kdglbk,"As someone who has never done drugs but had a huge crush on Sarah Lynn: I agree. It honestly enhances the experience a little tbh, the more you empathize with this cute, outgoing, spontaneous person, the more it hurts to realize they're endangering and hurting themselves."

3780,2020-12-15 01:44:26,kdb35s,I feel like I need to mention this every time: guac doesn't cost extra at Qdoba.
3781,2020-12-15 03:43:01,kdb35s,I wish there was something special about this burrito. Bring a vegan queso or something.

Im done with that place."
3783,2020-12-15 04:32:51,kdb35s,Why would I get that burrito when I can get the veggie bowl with guacamole included for 7 bucks

3791,2020-12-15 02:36:00,kdb35s,"I'm lucky in that my local ones put the sofritas closest to the glass. Nothing is dripped or dropped over the sofritas or the fajitas, since they have to reach further to get them.

I feel your pain, the location of the foods is the first thing I look for and if they're in the drip zone, be it Chipotle, Qdoba or wherever, I just turn around without even placing an order."
3792,2020-12-15 01:53:08,kdb35s," Didn‚Äôt Miley quit veganism? 

I like the fact that someone is encouraging a vegan food item. People who might have ordered something else may say ""wow, that sounds good!"".

There's a review online of a meat eater who's saying it's their new favorite option from Chipotle.

3793,2020-12-15 04:11:57,kdb35s,Qdoba is honestly so much better
3794,2020-12-15 02:47:53,kdb35s,"It's more the way she quit. She announced on Joe Rogan this year that she quit because her brain wasn't functioning properly without fish. This is after being a long outspoken vegan on social media, criticizing others for eating animals. She made anecdotal observations on his show about how her mind was sharper now, without making the connection that also quit alcohol last year and how that could affect her mind before and after quitting.

So it's nice she's advertising a vegan burrito, but she arguably did a lot of harm to the image of veganism already."
3795,2020-12-15 15:33:26,kdb35s,"Her brain wasn't functioning properly because of all those drugs she was doing. So along with that alcohol, also the drugs."
3796,2020-12-15 22:49:39,kdb35s,"Yeah, possibly that too, although I don't know as much on her history with that. I do know that she quit both veganism and alcohol in 2019 and that long term alcohol use has effects on cognition that gradually decrease for months after cessation, which exactly matches the brain issues she describes."

3804,2020-12-18 14:28:31,kdajfw,"/uj thats actually true, the conversion rate from ADA to DHA especially in males is pretty shitty when you don't really focus on Omega 6 to omega 3 ratio. Better option is to go for algae oil directly which reliable provides DHA and EPA. Long term concersation rate in vegans has not been determined, maybe you body adjusts, but wouldn't bet on it."

3841,2020-12-14 22:07:20,kd724r,"I do remember that happening but I actually think Taylor‚Äôs songwriting and growth influenced Plastic hearts a bit. I noticed songwriting similarities in some of the slow songs on the album (I think Never Be Me and Golden G String, not to say Taylor is the only songwriter ever, I just heard similarities to the maturity of lover and folklore) and it made me think maybe through years of growth personally and musically perhaps it might be possible, that drama I think was over 10 years ago? Idk, I‚Äôm hopeful dreaming üòÖ I also have a soft spot for Miley, I feel like unfortunately she isn‚Äôt as welcomed in the music industry after her public actions over the last decade, but you can tell she really did focus on music this time and is maturing and I feel like that‚Äôs something Taylor would relate to on a less severe level as their personal/public issues have been near polar opposite."

This will be a fun watch."

&#x200B;

I wanna channel this funky bad bitch energy going on here and ride it till I die

Can I just say I hate that yongue thing she does tho"
3862,2020-12-15 21:29:56,kd1h7b,"I never go to concerts but I would definetely go to a Miley's one, her live vocals is just incredible and she always add colour to her performances that makes the song even better than the recorded one."
3863,2020-12-15 19:04:48,kd1h7b,Great video... But has she aged like a billion years? Is that Cher playing Miley?
3864,2020-12-14 18:13:42,kd1h7b,"Her voice sounds horrible. She has such a great, powerful voice that even at ""horrible"" she hits the notes and sings well but her voice just sounds extremely broken. I know when I lose my voice, I still have it but it's really deep. Her voice sounds even deeper than usual, like she's on the verge of knocking it out altogether."
3865,2020-12-14 17:44:14,kd1h7b,"crying, i thought it was him too üò≠"

3867,2020-12-15 00:58:25,kd1h7b,Her style and look this era is one of my absolute favorites by any artist like ever!
3868,2020-12-15 04:06:01,kd1h7b,Hearing her voice in the BS just blows you away with how much of a vocal powerhouse she is. I completely agree!
3869,2020-12-14 19:33:34,kd1h7b,"here ill sing them for u

ahem

Keep ME Up all night (you keep me up) keep Me UP All NIGHT!"
3870,2020-12-15 05:47:31,kd1h7b,"They seem slightly out of her comfortable range due to her vocal damage, so she was playing it safe. The peak of that section is a note above the peak note that she has hit this year, if I am not mistaken."
3871,2020-12-15 03:38:48,kd1h7b,Same! What the heck!! That's the best part of the song.
3872,2020-12-15 05:41:50,kd1h7b,Omg. I was saying to myself that it reminds me of her breakout album for some reason... couldn‚Äôt put my finger on it... this is it!!
3873,2020-12-14 19:14:04,kd1h7b,"I don‚Äôt get what you‚Äôre on about. I gave it a listen thinking it‚Äôd be nails on chalkboard thanks to your description but she practically sounds the same as she does in studio.

Way to be over dramatic. Maybe she just isn‚Äôt your cup of tea right now because of genre reasons."

3875,2020-12-15 10:42:18,kd1h7b,"She‚Äôs doing the raspiness on purpose, it‚Äôs a vocal technique"
3876,2020-12-15 12:56:30,kd1h7b,"I agree, she sounded a bit out of tune at some place, and her voice became really weak compared to before, I think she smoked it away possibly, I love the rasp and all but her voice does sound damaged and limited in range ( she screams a lot of the notes )"
3877,2020-12-14 17:02:59,kczvz8,"Ohhhh look, i've got me tit out."
3878,2020-12-14 17:23:11,kczvz8,She could be a character on the Dark Crystal.

3894,2020-12-30 17:42:38,kn4hzg,Tight body.
3895,2020-12-30 17:22:24,kn4hzg,"I think some people are still holding onto that childhood crush they had on Hannah Montana, but yeah I agree with you"
3896,2020-12-30 20:26:01,kn4hzg,She has a great body but her goofy personality is a huge turn off.
3897,2020-12-31 05:27:04,kn4hzg,"Yea, she stays fit so sexy"
3898,2020-12-30 16:41:59,kn40zm,beautiful
3899,2020-12-30 16:59:46,kn3tcx,"I know this is probably the wrong sub for this but has anyone else become disillusioned with the process that pop songs are made? It feels so... impersonal and automated. Not to discredit the amazing singers, producers, songwriters, etc. but it leaves a sour taste in my mouth when the only person credited in the title is the singer and not the many other artists who contributed because they're less 'marketable'"
3900,2020-12-30 17:11:46,kn3tcx,"I saw a lot of people here saying Future Nostalgia is too impersonal and anyone could have recorded it. Then I saw a lot of stuff showing the opposite, such as Dua's Song Exploder episodes. 

I thought it was just smart communication to keep her momentum ahead of the grammys but this interview kind of make me doubt. I wonder if he's the kind of guy her label would ask to say something like this, given that he had other things to say about the other artists."
3901,2020-12-30 17:32:59,kn3tcx,Cool read. Thanks.
3902,2020-12-30 18:03:59,kn3tcx,Pop and rap are always gonna be this way.
3903,2020-12-30 19:54:50,kn3tcx,"Not at all. I think it‚Äôs fascinating. Behind all of it there‚Äôs something genuine, and these stories show that. I like seeing how it metamorphoses over time from its original seed to the final production."
3904,2020-12-30 17:34:51,kn3tcx,"Not really. I think that's the case with most songs that go beyond amateur production, pop or any genre. Titles are titles, short and concise, I don't think it's a problem that the biggest contributer which is typically the singer gets the biggest credit (there are also many cases where the producer gets that credit). I'm sure most contributers don't mind and are fairly compensated (cases that aren't seem to make it to the news pretty quickly)."
3905,2020-12-31 02:59:49,kn3tcx,"Counterpoint: Think about all the people who contribute their talents on a movie, for the star and maybe the director to get all the credit. And on a TV show perhaps a celebrity show runner like Ryan Murphy or Shonda Rhimes will get credit in some cases, but beyond that it's really just the actors who anybody pays any attention to.

This really is just how the entire entertainment industry works. The performer out front is the face of a huge team that largely stays out of the spotlight."
3906,2020-12-30 18:30:37,kn3tcx,Lots of artists and producers who have worked with Dua have lauded her for having such a clear vision and being very inspirational. She seems like the real deal!
3907,2020-12-30 21:22:53,kn3tcx,"Well, that's a nice way to think about it. I guess at its best the current system works exactly as you describe it. I do believe that at its worst though it's a lot worse. From what I've heard from most interviews, etc. with producers, there's rarely a personal connection. It's more a free-for-all to get a placement or to desperately get an artist's attention so that you can finally MAYBE get into a well-known artist's song. That's from mainly hip-hop circles but I would imagine it applies to pop too."
3908,2020-12-30 21:26:32,kn3tcx,I'd have to disagree that the singer is the biggest contributor. Many times they sing words and melodies that weren't written by them on music tracks they barely helped write.  When's the last time you knew a song writer's name? They did as much if not more than the singer but they're virtually unknown.
3909,2020-12-30 22:55:50,kn3tcx,"That's really disregarding what the singer brings to the table: vocals, performance, charisma/personality etc. Writing a song and recording it poorly will get you nowhere. Writing a song and having no stage presence while performing it will get you nowhere. Writing a song and not being an interesting/attractive enough celebrity to follow will usually not get you far (and if you're not at all attractive you at least need to be funny or weird/gimmicky or a guy). It takes a lot to have people want to consume your music and follow your career and songwriting is one component. Some people can and DO do both, others can't and others still could but don't want to because that kind of fame isn't for everyone."
3910,2020-12-30 22:44:39,kn3tcx,"Singing is pretty important, it also depends on a case by case basis which is why I said ""often"". It's all pretty subjective what constitutes ""doing much"" anyway. The songwriters are still getting paid and don't seem to mind their names just being credited on wikipedia so I don't see why we need to complain on their behalf."

3971,2020-12-29 23:29:44,kmo7u2,"If WLR sells ~125k I feel like a couple of songs will chart, especially since less people are gonna listen to Christmas songs after Dec 25th"
3972,2020-12-30 00:45:57,kmo7u2,"the kanye track would have been a top 5 debut on spotify without christmas songs, i think itll make it"
3973,2020-12-30 00:54:41,kmo7u2,Blinding Lights might come back next week
3974,2020-12-30 01:27:55,kmo7u2,"That's one way to look at it, I fucking hate it."
3975,2020-12-29 23:52:30,kmo7u2,"For the marketing that album got, the first week sale is gonna flop"
3976,2020-12-30 01:18:43,kmo7u2,"Yeah I'm not entirely sure it can beat out taylor swifts album for number 1 anymore tbh, which is sad because if kid cudi was on it that would have been a top 10 hit easily with the album going number 1 even though it was originally big 1.5 years ago, a fan post of the song on youtube uploaded recently as they all get taken down is getting more views than some songs on wlr"
3977,2020-12-30 06:06:56,kmo7u2,2016-2018 i had a gf every christmas! then 2019 and now 2020 i‚Äôve been single. as much as i like a relationship i‚Äôve appreciated my time single. hope you can too man
3978,2020-12-30 05:20:21,kmo7u2,I mean what can they do. AIWFC had 17 million streams in one day on Spotify a couple of days ago. If that‚Äôs not deserving of number 1 I don‚Äôt know what is.
3979,2020-12-30 13:46:01,kmo7u2,it is. charts are counted week ahead
3980,2020-12-30 02:18:19,kmo7u2,Not necessarily. People just associate it with the holidays. A lot of people are definitely just letting Spotify playlists run the music
3981,2020-12-30 03:07:01,kmo7u2,"Nah man, for me it's just a warm cozy vibe to have Christmas music playing when it's cold outside and I'm at work. Perfect background music for this time of year."
3982,2020-12-30 17:55:23,kmo7u2,"It‚Äôs not really a religious thing, christmas is very secularized in America."
3983,2020-12-30 17:12:58,kmo7u2,Christmastime gives many people a feeling that I would say is comparable to nostalgia. Listening to the music helps people get into that feeling. Plus tradition
3984,2020-12-30 07:54:27,kmo7u2,I think Slayer doing better than the kanye song
3985,2020-12-30 06:05:35,kmo7u2,what marketing? it‚Äôs literally almost driven by hype generated by carti fans and blogs. no real singles prior to it. it‚Äôs just carti posting shit
3986,2020-12-30 00:22:46,kmo7u2,Well I mean the album was terrible
3987,2020-12-30 06:11:10,kmo7u2,Yeah I‚Äôm equal parts nervous and excited about my single life. It‚Äôs just the uncertainty that gets to me sometimes although I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be fine. Thanks bro
3988,2020-12-30 02:30:12,kmo7u2,Ah ok makes sense
3989,2020-12-30 16:24:34,kmo7u2,also don't underestimate how many people are using this for their businesses
3990,2020-12-30 20:14:42,kmo7u2,"True shit, can't remember the last time I heard someone regard Christmas celebrations in a religious light"
3991,2020-12-30 09:58:07,kmo7u2,"Yeah, Slay3r has the most streams."
3992,2020-12-30 03:37:48,kmo7u2,"it's good, remove a couple songs and it's a 8/10 at least"
3993,2020-12-30 06:11:48,kmo7u2,no worries man. you got this!
3994,2020-12-31 01:06:28,kmo7u2,like there's basically another holiday on top of it with Santa and presents that even non-Christians practice and tell their kids abt
3995,2020-12-30 04:48:13,kmo7u2,The beginning sucks and nobody is going to listen to the rest of the album if they get a bad first impression.
3996,2020-12-30 04:11:42,kmo7u2,Not even close it‚Äôs a 4 at best lmao
3997,2020-12-30 05:03:05,kmo7u2,"i completely understand but that's why I'm saying this, ppl listened to the first half and turned it off"
3998,2020-12-30 10:08:57,kmo7u2,Best part of the album is beginning and Album is great
3999,2020-12-30 05:03:59,kmo7u2,idk how you can listen to the second half and think most of those songs arent good (assuming youre a carti fan)
4000,2020-12-30 04:57:26,kmo7u2,"As an overall tape yes.

But there's still a few songs that are prime Carti"
4001,2020-12-30 12:04:44,kmo7u2,The one where he‚Äôs like THEY THOUGHT I WAS GAY was hard
4002,2020-12-30 04:01:48,kmny31,Skank

4010,2020-12-29 17:02:31,kmg1ix,"It‚Äôs hard to answer. I read somewhere that even the most followed people on the platform have inactive, or clone (no profile pic, no info) followers. Maybe they bought it, maybe their fans run some kind of software to buff followers for their idol. No one really knows."
4011,2020-12-29 16:10:00,kmg1ix,"I‚Äôd say probably not. The idols I follow on insta all have pretty proportional followings to to their notoriety. Even the most famous ones, like the members of Blackpink and Taemin and Kai, have a lot of followers probably because they have a lot of fans. I also doubt companies have seen Instagram as enough of a ‚Äúflop‚Äù to resort to buying followers. Yet."
4012,2020-12-29 17:30:16,kmg1ix,"there‚Äôs a good chance that some followers are fake. if it‚Äôs that way for most celebrities, i don‚Äôt see why it would be any different for kpop idols"
4013,2020-12-29 18:48:06,kmg1ix,"I personally don‚Äôt think so for Instagram specifically. Although some American artists might, I don‚Äôt think Instagram effects kpop artists enough for companies to want to buy followers for them. I think the most likely event of this happening would be fans trying to inflate followers for their idols ( as another comment said). However, if it was a different social media platform like Weibo I could definitely be persuaded that idol followings are fake."
4014,2020-12-29 20:03:58,kmg1ix,"I don't think they do (though maybe fans can make multiple accounts). From what I've seen in my surroundings (I'm in SEA, travelled a bit to different parts of Asia with other friends in different countries), IG is very prevalent for kpopfans in this part of the world, and even for normal celebrities. Followers count here are in millions, even for local celebrities. [From this list](https://www.trackalytics.com/the-most-followed-instagram-profiles/) not sure whether it's updated. Indian cricketeer is on rank 28 with 85mil, Indonesian local celebrity pair is on rank 58 with 48.7m. Lisa and the rest of BP has kpopfans + SEA boost + pretty influencer hence 30-40mil, hence the numbers. For the rest of kpop most followed I think it's kpopfans + SEA boost for 10-20mil."
4015,2020-12-29 21:23:12,kmg1ix,"I wish the article had talked more about how they detected fake followers. Does this include inactive accounts? What if people have multiple accounts?

Edit: So, the software they used is called IG Audit, it was made Andrew Hogue back in 2018 until it was banned by Facebook about a year ago (unsurprisingly cause it threatens the ""integrity"" of their site if everyone figures out just how easy it is to get fake followers).

I don't doubt that there are a lot of fake followers, but I did see an article mentioning some the possible ways to detect bot accounts such as:

-lots of accounts following an account in a different country from theirs

-huge spikes in follower count

-consistent spikes in follower count (like +60 every day or something, since when you buy followers, you can choose to have them added gradually)

Which kind of makes me wonder if the accuracy of the data could vary depending on the celebrity."
4016,2020-12-30 00:27:42,kmg1ix,"There was an article that I read a couple of years ago (not sure if it's the same one you read) that basically confirmed that a certain percentage of Instagram followers on ALL large accounts are not real. I wish I could find it and repost. I'm not sure about people ""buying"" fake accounts but I do recall them talking about the numbers not necessarily being accurate because some of the accounts subscribed were not legitimate."
4017,2020-12-29 15:46:09,kmg1ix,they dont need to. kpop has huge following
4018,2020-12-29 17:20:37,kmg1ix,"Personally, I don‚Äôt know or care.  I follow the ones I follow, and I‚Äôm real... :)"
4019,2020-12-29 19:14:41,kmg1ix,"i don‚Äôt think a ton of them are fake followers tbh. i‚Äôd say maybe SOME have bought followers but most of the time i don‚Äôt think so. 

totally off topic but can the individual members of BTS, Ateez, and Stray Kids please make instas now??? and can the rest of NCT do it now too? lmaooo"
4020,2020-12-30 01:12:50,kmg1ix,well... pledis did the opposite and took away svt's personal igs :')
4021,2021-02-18 20:35:20,kmg1ix,"I'm sure they buy followers. I think the same is happening on YT too. Likes don't support the followings on both platforms for a lot of them. I think almost all companies and artists and entertainment people , kpop or otherwise , buy bot subcribers and followers"
4022,2020-12-30 07:35:03,kmg1ix,">*edit* I‚Äôm seeing a lot of answers in kind of aggressive/offended tones,

You made the mistake of giving examples. You are not allowed to talk about data analytics or any other dry boring subjects round here as they are interpreted as you being an anti, any subject will be. You mentioned Exo and Blackpink, this was never going to go well. Just speak in vague generalities and it will be easier."
4023,2020-12-29 18:21:14,kmg1ix,"Fans creating extra accounts/bots was my thought too.

A lot of kpop fandoms can be aggressive and competitive, so I wouldn't be surprised if fans themselves created campaigns to inflate Instagram followings for their favorite idols who ""deserve"" them."
4024,2020-12-29 19:37:01,kmg1ix,"Tbh inactive accounts can easily be a thing. Take Ariana Grande for example, she‚Äôs been on the platform for at least 6 years (but i think more like 7 or 8). It‚Äôs sure that there are old accouts that people don‚Äôt use anymore that follow her! I‚Äôm sure this happens with most peoples"
4025,2020-12-29 19:40:45,kmg1ix,Totally agree to this. Blackpink‚Äôs IG followers aren‚Äôt questionable since they have quite a proportionate number on subscribers on Youtube. And they cater to a lot of people on IG too not just their fans but to people who look a lot on their visuals and the brands they wear.
4026,2020-12-29 18:51:31,kmg1ix,Thank you so much for you answer! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
4027,2020-12-30 01:35:11,kmg1ix,"Also, sometimes people create fake accounts for their own reasons (like to spam or catfish), and those accounts often follow real people in order to look more legit.

Those accounts (often created by bots) would fall under the fake category in an IG Audit, but wouldn‚Äôt have been bought by the followed person themselves."
4028,2020-12-29 19:43:09,kmg1ix,This also applies to all of the western celebs they mentioned. I don't think any big celebrities like Selena Gomez and Kim Kardashian need to buy followers at all. No offense to OP but I wonder where that research came from.
4029,2020-12-29 19:18:07,kmg1ix,"Sis, I swear insta is just one more way idols torture us, it‚Äôs the aesthetic torture. I hate Johnny Suh Instagram. You‚Äôre lucky your biases don‚Äôt have one, rest safe and peacefully my dear üíö"
4030,2020-12-30 15:10:47,kmg1ix,"I made the mistake? The mistake of saying Instagram is (I‚Äôm quoting) ‚Äúevidently becoming quite important for idols as a marketing tool‚Äù? I‚Äôm not allowed?

I don‚Äôt think so. I would understand if I used accusatory terms, which I didn‚Äôt, why people would get upset. Loads of people gave extremely interesting insights and different point of views on what I asked without taking any offense, seeing that there was nothing to be offended about, those are the only answers I was looking forward to get."
4031,2020-12-29 20:10:47,kmg1ix,"[here‚Äôs](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/celebrities/news/amp28695143/celebrities-most-fake-instagram-followers/) the article

I intentionally chose not to mention the kpop group in the article because I knew the reactions it would generate, but apparently I didn‚Äôt need to seeing the ones I got for a simple curiosity"
4032,2020-12-29 19:55:45,kmg1ix,i bias hendery and winwin!!!
4033,2020-12-30 15:25:19,kmg1ix,"People find problems with everything, to avoid this its best to just leave out examples of actual groups. It's ridiculous and you shouldnt have to but if you want to avoid these issues and have the actual message focused on you gotta spoon feed these people and they get hung up on examples. Exo arent really this, BP arent really that etc they lose sight of the original point that wasnt specifically about any group."
4034,2020-12-29 16:21:32,kmf4yl,I love famous people who love being naked.
4035,2020-12-29 15:51:16,kmf4yl, beautifull  beautifull

4038,2020-12-29 14:27:35,kmf4yl,Must be selling something. She's had her tits out all over the place lately.

4040,2020-12-30 00:45:38,kmf4yl,They are called porn stars
4041,2020-12-29 15:50:04,kmf4yl,I love it when dudes frequenting a sub dedicated to nude celebs whine about a celeb getting nude.
4042,2020-12-29 18:01:08,kmf4yl,Not whining per se. Just pointing out there always seems to be surge of nudity from her when there's a new album to promote.
