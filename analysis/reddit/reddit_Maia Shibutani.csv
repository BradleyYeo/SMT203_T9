1,2020-06-02 06:46:10,gv0epy,"Okay now list all the black celebrities that stood up for Asians when we were being assaulted the past few months over covid. Not only did no one speak up for Asians but many in the black community actually told us we deserved it. Usually for reasons like how the Chinese government evicted some illegal Africans immigrants, how Asian grandmas stared at them for too long or how Asian nail salon workers talked shit about them in another language - even though they can't understand or speak it, they just knew Asians had to be talking shit about them.

Maybe blacks should examine the anti-Asian racism that is rampant in their community before expecting Asians to care about their problems. All these Asian celebrities who stayed silent all these months while Asians were being assaulted but now act like they care about social and racial issues, should kindly stfu. These hypocritical attention whores should be ashamed of themselves."
2,2020-06-02 07:15:55,gv0epy,">The problem here isnâ€™t that Asians arenâ€™t speaking it. The problem is that those who say we donâ€™t speak up donâ€™t care enough about Asian celebrities to even know their names. ï¿¼

THIS! Exactly what I've been thinking. Even saw a prominent mixed asian youtuber talking about 'asians don't speak up'. The support from asians in the west for black lives highly outweighs the ones against it or passive about it.

It's fucking stupid the way asians perpetuate this narrative without thinking it through. They're trying to fit in and throw each other under the bus.

At same time fuck Tou Thao, the cop's wife and any self-hating, complicit asian involved.

edit: the hadids are asian?"
3,2020-06-02 05:56:04,gv0epy,Maybe 5 of this list advocate for racism against Asian. Simu Liu is a vocal one.
4,2020-06-02 05:09:33,gv0epy,"After the LA riots. The Korean community and the black community wanted to bridge their gap and understand each other better. I remember back in 1995 they even had a international study program where black kids can go to South Korea to learn about Korean culture . 

Fast forward today ...nothing changed.  .."
5,2020-06-02 16:28:48,gv0epy,Unfortunately they weren't looking to change their opinions to begin with.
6,2020-06-02 05:50:47,gv0epy,Iâ€™m close to saying fuck America and moving to Asia for real
7,2020-06-02 08:43:48,gv0epy,"Preach it my man!

Iâ€™ve been saying the same exact thing for the past months, and asking for a list of black celebs that have ever come out against the COVID prompted racist attacks. The only one that provided any real support to the Asian community was [RZA](https://www.instagram.com/p/B-II5gBgvzJ/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet). 

Where was the social outcry from the black community after three black teens assault, while on FB live, and laughing and daring each other to kick and old Asian lady in the face. Does nobody understand that this was inhumane? 

[Three Black Teens Assault Asian Grandma](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.buzzfeednews.com/amphtml/briannasacks/teens-minnesota-kicking-asian-american-woman) 

Where was the public outcry and condemnation from the Black Community?"
8,2020-06-02 09:00:49,gv0epy,"Yes they are half Palestinian (which isnâ€™t necessary east or sea Asian, but I still count as Asian)"
9,2020-06-02 09:57:00,gv0epy,"Yea LA riots were far worse than what's happening today.  The city looked like a war zone fires as far as you can see..  Looting is looting....just a reflection on people's priorities.  Steal nice shit , sell , get money. Pay bills,  eat food. I for one will do my part and look at offerup and craigslist for good deals... Morals?  pfft , the same white morals used to justify dehumanizing black people and other people of color.  I won't take any of this shit seriously until the black people in Houston riot and loot.  That's when you know shit got real."
10,2020-06-02 16:48:12,gv0epy,"Pretty sure that consisted of black/African American male sexpats looking to go after Korean girls, just like these days you have a shit ton of Koreaphiles and japanophile white/black American males who go for ""language exchange"", or who love to visit Thailand, or who sign up in the military and all choose to want to be stationed in Japan or Korea. You know full well WTF white, black, and latino males **only** have in mind when it comes to Asians.  


Asian men as a whole, and especially in Asia need to be less KKK UCKED"
11,2020-06-02 14:06:52,gv0epy,"Because ""bridging the gap"" is a platitude offered in bad faith to justify letting black criminals continue to victimize Asians."
12,2020-06-02 06:35:35,gv0epy,"If you are serious about doing this make sure you are:

- Proficient in the language. Speaking casual conversations with your parents won't prepare you for actually living in the country and surviving. Make sure you have a solid understanding of the language - reading, writing and speaking.
- Have a job lined up or have a guaranteed source of income. Just trying to wing it post move will be a terrible decision. Don't do this.
- Have a place to stay. Housing shortage is real problem in many Asian countries, particularly in the metro areas.

If you have all these three lined up then moving sooner than later might be prudent. The longer you wait, the less likely you will go through with it."
13,2020-06-02 10:02:29,gv0epy,Don't. You need to stay there and fight.
14,2020-06-02 08:54:55,gv0epy,Go to Lipstickalley. They always post threads on Asians getting discrimination and they laugh about it.
15,2020-06-02 07:01:01,gv0epy,Hell man...what about sexpats? They go to asia and become lifers overthere. Oh wait...being white kind of gives them some special treatment even in asia.
16,2020-06-02 11:07:32,gv0epy,Isnâ€™t that a forum site?
17,2020-06-02 07:13:06,gv0epy,"They usually stick around for a year or two until the novelty of living in Asia wears off and they miss the comforts of being home. Or when they realize they are just babysitting jesters that parents pay to keep their kids occupied for a few hours everyday. At some point they all realize they wasted their time doing jackshit while their life back home has moved on without them. The ones who remain become extremely bitter and resentful that they are trapped, since they have no other skills to earn a living."
18,2020-06-02 14:14:51,gv0epy,"Yes, mostly by black women."
19,2020-06-02 09:54:39,gv0epy,Many get disability/social security payments from their origin country.  That's how they can survive with out any real skill.
20,2020-11-24 06:06:11,jzylop,"I think Nelly might've opened the door for some pretty interesting people to do the show, as I did not ever expect to see him on DWTS, and given his success I wouldn't be surprised if we saw a few more relevant stars in the future."
21,2020-11-24 06:03:56,jzylop,"Niecy Nash would be a force of nature as I feel like she was awesome and had nice growth in her debut season, but I think her downfall was she had a bad week in a season with a good amount of consistent dancers."
22,2020-11-24 09:57:07,jzylop,"Highkey agree that S30 could make for a rather nice all-stars season, especially as the first one would be 15 seasons prior, so it's a nice ""milestone,"" if you will. 

One of my shower thoughts a few weeks ago was to basically lump all of the S16-S29 second-placers into one season. That's not a perfect idea (like I would rather see Normani instead of David Ross), but my mind was just thinking, ""of all the people who were robbed (a bit impassioned there), I now want to see them duke it out!"""
23,2020-11-24 11:35:59,jzylop,"On her podcast Cheryl mentioned that the all star season didnâ€™t fare well but she would like to see a second chance season for those stars that had to abruptly exit ie Jewel. 

So on that note I was thinking 

Christie Brinkley 
Tamar Braxton 
Jewel 
Jeannie Mai 
Ray Lewis 
Sarah (the country singer who left due to divorce)"
24,2020-11-24 05:50:31,jzylop,heather would definitely be someone i would love to see again
25,2020-11-24 16:01:29,jzylop,"And Zendaya is way too busy! I imagine, However, she would love to return to the ballroom if she could fit it into a schedule."
26,2020-11-24 07:58:14,jzylop,Would love to have heather back on!! would also love Harry shum jr ðŸ¥º
