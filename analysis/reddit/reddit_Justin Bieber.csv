He‚Äôs clearly a man who, when picking his skill points, put everything into strength and neglected every other attribute. This is an unbalanced setup and he will find later levels tricky.

Recently there has been a rise in reported cases of ""Chronic Lyme Disease"" featuring genetic symptoms such as lethargy or muscle pain.  Chronic Lyme Disease is not a recognised illness and it has been seized upon by alternative medicine practitioners who offer a range of ""trestments"".  This is extremely controversial because sufferers have genuine symptoms  symptoms and may well be suffering from another illness."

16,2020-02-05 07:48:04,ez5agn,"I am not disputing it is real. But is it exactly what many celebrities have got and then post treatment are miraculously cured after years of misdiagnosis of other illnesses such as depression, chronic fatigue etc?

Australia is very science driven, non-progressive health system and our official stance on it is 'it doesnt exist in Australia'.
The crazy part is it seems like it has an easy treatment through antibiotics, but doctors just wont prescribe them, ever, for it. You can have a bad cold and its easier to get antibiotics.

As a casual outside observer it just seems like it may be over diagnosed as a placebo of sorts to those that are somehow convinced that something is wrong with them, and read too much online looking for self-diagnosis, only because they are too proud to admit they are depressed or have something psychosomatic going on. I'm australian and if you ever go to your GP and even mention Lyme disease they shut you down instantly and pretty much eject out. Like they are trained to watch out for hypochondriacs that self diagnose with it.

Celebrities with Lyme disease always seem to have timed their diagnosis with troughs in their career, to name a few:

Justine Bieber
Shania Twain
Avril Lavigne
Ben Stiller
Ally Hilfiger
Richard Gere
Alec Baldwin

And they are all celebs that have have good expendable income but long periods of lulls in their career. Its like they are looking for some reason to rationalise their depression, but are too proud to admit its in their head or self-inflicted."

32,2020-02-05 13:58:06,ez33e7,"Gonna be harsh but honest. It‚Äôs not about the values themselves, it‚Äôs about feeling superior. Looking deep down are you REALLY that surprised that judgemental thinking like this:

> Not only did we not care about pop culture, but we actively tiraded against it... [we used to] rant to others about the atrocities of the meat industry, or chide friends for shopping at chain stores instead of local shops.

Turned into:

> Ive noticed recently that she makes comments about peoples weight, or facial features in a negative way, tearing down other women in really petty ways. (my wife 10 years ago would have definitely kicked the shit out of my wife now). She makes fun of her old friends for being losers, or frumpy, or whatever. For being perpetually miserable in their dark loft apartments making sad music for other losers.

When you were young you both equated your values/morals with ‚Äòbeing right‚Äô and pushed that onto other people. You judged others for not living up to your obviously correct standards. You didn‚Äôt notice it at the time because you felt the judgement was ‚Äòright‚Äô - the only reason it‚Äôs now jarring is because you now disagree with what she feels makes her superior.

When you matured, you realised you could still live your values and morals and be satisfied doing that by itself rather than feeling superior by it. She didn‚Äôt so now she‚Äôs into celebrities instead of feminism, it‚Äôs still something she uses against others to feel superior. You think it doesn‚Äôt make sense that she‚Äôs now judging other women for not fitting her aesthetic because she used to be sooo feminist, but it was never about the values themselves - it was about feeling better than others.

It‚Äôs something I‚Äôve noticed sometimes with people with extremely passionate ‚Äòmoral‚Äô views. It‚Äôs not about the cause itself, it‚Äôs about feeling better than everyone else. Example - when they were teenagers my cousin and her husband refused to drink alcohol. Fair play, it‚Äôs their choice to be teetotal. Drinking alcohol was ‚Äòstupid‚Äô and looked down on by them. Now they‚Äôre in their late 20s they both drink whenever they want. Drinking is now cool and people who don‚Äôt want to drink/party are boring. Spoiler - it‚Äôs never been about drinking, it‚Äôs about THEIR choices and THEIR views always being superior and better than everyone else‚Äôs.

Your wife used to judge people for not ascribing to the morals she deemed correct and saw mainstream things as beneath her - now she‚Äôs discovered she likes mainstream things, anyone outside that bubble is now beneath her. Judging someone for not shopping locally or judging someone for being fat - it all stems from the same shit. You just didn‚Äôt realise because her judgements were ‚Äòright‚Äô before and now they‚Äôre ‚Äòwrong‚Äô - but she‚Äôs always had the same superiority complex, you just couldn‚Äôt see it because you agreed."
33,2020-02-05 08:30:16,ez33e7,"It seems to me that her self esteem may be a little strained currently. 15 years ago, she may have been immune to societal expectations about women's looks/behavior, but as you age, and particularly if you're constantly inundated with photos of celebrities/ influencers, that insecurity can start to creep in. It may not even be something she can articulate/ recognize in herself. But the less self-assured you feel, the more you might seek validation from (somewhat less cerebral) friends, Instagram followers, etc. It's an easy way to feel better about yourself, even if you're not feeling explicitly ""bad"" or depressed. Activism and art are fulfilling, but they can also be exhausting. Speaking of exhausting, her career may be taking a lot out of her.


As a working woman in a happy relationship, I can speak from experience: as my workload has increased, my hobbies have fallen off (and to some extent, my political engagement too), and I find myself seeking vacuous forms of entertainment (hours and hours of stand-up comedy and Reddit), coupled with obsessively changing skin and haircare regimes to look prettier. I think it would shock most of the people who know me well, because it's out of character. I just don't have the mental energy at the end of most days to get into more thought-intensive activities. 


My suggestion is this: try to seek out some new mutual hobbies that still give her a chance to turn off/ unwind. Substitute some mimosa brunches with The Plastics with picnics for the two of you. Go wander around in a new town, and find a good spot for tea or coffee. Try to allocate some time to talk about things of little consequence, as a means of mitigating the stress she experiences throughout the week. By no means should you abandon deeper, more philosophical conversations, but just recognize that your wife might not have the stamina anymore to be *constantly* mentally/emotionally engaged in art/music/activism/global affairs, *especially* if she genuinely cares about these things."
34,2020-02-05 05:19:18,ez33e7,Could you both look into finding a new hobby or interest that you can both enjoy together? Not one of your old hobbies or what she‚Äôs interested in now but something new for both of you to explore.
35,2020-02-05 13:36:28,ez33e7,"First, it‚Äôs shitty that your wife has turned to being nasty to other people as she struggles with her self esteem. I hope she seeks some form of therapy for help with that.

With that out of the way: You don‚Äôt come out and say it explicitly, but your post has a pretty strong undercurrent of shame and resentment toward your wife‚Äôs evolving interests. I understand that her hobbies are moving into a direction that you don‚Äôt particularly understand or enjoy‚Äîand honestly, I (30F) may not feel comfortable around your wife‚Äôs new friends, either‚Äîbut it really seems like you‚Äôve lost respect for her, too. 

People can enjoy vapid, dumb shit and still have depth, values and complex inner lives. Do you think your wife is losing these things because you think her new hobbies and interests are silly?

I echo another poster here in saying that, as I‚Äôve aged and have coped with the personal and collective traumas of our current climate, I find it harder to be ‚Äúon‚Äù in that way all the time. Sometimes it really is just too much to be fully engaged and to stay sane at the same time. I escape through video games and Reddit, your wife turns to celeb gossip.

I can relate to wanting to look better, too. I was an athlete and a tomboy and didn‚Äôt want to ‚Äúconform‚Äù as a teenager and young adult. But as I get into my thirties, I‚Äôm realizing that I‚Äôm sick of having bad skin! And I actually kind of want to feel confident and present myself like a real professional adult woman! It‚Äôs natural to want these things as we age.

I say this with kindness: We all have known‚Äîor once were, ourselves‚Äîthe kind of (typically) young people who think that hating pop culture is a personality. I was like this, too! Eventually, I found it exhausting and useless to shit on what brings other people joy...and that I was denying some of my own interests in the process. If this sounds familiar, do you think you may not have grown out of that phase as much as you think? 

You sound like a good guy who loves your wife! I hope you find a resolution for this particular snag, and I do hope your wife can find ways to address some of the unhealthier aspects of her hobbies. Please just try to be supportive and non-judgemental, and to examine/challenge your own perspective and assumptions every now and then!  Good luck!"
36,2020-02-05 09:34:13,ez33e7,">She stares into the mirror and talks about how ugly and fat she is getting

Honestly, this is probably the core of everything. People who are happy in themselves and their lives don't tear down strangers, they don't live vicariously through others, they don't turn replace the world with a screen. 

It sounds like she's had a hard time reconciling what she wanted from life with what she's actually got from life. 

Either way, if she wants to be who she was - happy and engaged, that's something you can save. If this the direction she wants to keep living in, you need to really think if she's who you want to spend the rest of your life with. Because this stuff *is* catching."
37,2020-02-05 11:52:29,ez33e7,"I fell into this rabbit hole. I read gossip for hours on end, initially to fill the time but then I noticed I was having unkind thoughts about complete strangers. I deleted my apps and subscriptions and have no real knowledge of celebrities these days aside from their appearance in such and such film.

My strategy was that for every unkind thought about someone superfically, I would think of three positive features or attributes. It was kind kf like reprogramming almost.

It is up to your wife to reign herself in. Maybe though you can point our her inital superficial comments and ask why she ""actually"" said that. It might help her realise a pattern of negative thinking.

I wish you and your wife all the best."
38,2020-02-05 04:43:18,ez33e7,"You have grown apart. It happens. Now you have to decide if this new person is someone you can love, accept and live with."
39,2020-02-05 08:36:52,ez33e7,What do you still love about her?
40,2020-02-05 03:53:47,ez33e7,You have grown in completely different directions and may have reached the point of no longer being compatible. It happens. She's still your wife and someone you've lived with for years; talk to her. Don't be negative or anything about who she has become or what she likes because that makes you a bit hypocritical (you speaking negatively of her friends or interests is pretty much the same as her talking negatively about other people's looks or interests); just tell her honestly that you seem to have grown to have very different interests and outlooks on life now and you think you each might be happier splitting up and finding people who better fit who both of you are now.
41,2020-02-05 03:54:04,ez33e7,Have you talked to her about any of this?
42,2020-02-05 07:55:11,ez33e7,Justin Bieber is married now.
43,2020-02-05 06:50:55,ez33e7,"The person she is now sounds very judgemental and mean, but you yourself also sound quite judgemental. It's really odd that you list drinking mimosas and having platinum blond hair as faults along with being cruel to others. I'm not saying you should or shouldn't stay with her but either way, some introspection is in order."
44,2020-02-05 07:05:12,ez33e7,If you‚Äôve discussed it and she doesn‚Äôt see a problem then the problem is yours.  You cannot change her back to what she was. The first thing you have to do is accept that.  We cannot change people. If we ask other people to change for us 95-99% of the time that does not work. You have to accept her as she is and ask yourself can you still love her like this. If the answer is no then the sooner you both move on the better.  I will say however that dumping someone because you dislike their current hobbies does seem a bit shallow.  If the bigger issue is her personality change then that‚Äôs not shallow.
45,2020-02-05 08:30:19,ez33e7,Honest question: have you moved recently? Could she be lonely? I‚Äôve always been the type to love celebrity gossip but I find myself getting much more interested if I‚Äôm lacking people to be social with. Do you hang out with her? Does she have true friends? I start picking fights when I‚Äôm lonely and bored. Maybe she needs some more stimulation than what she‚Äôs receiving currently.
46,2020-02-05 04:48:38,ez33e7,"
>they have platinum blonde hair and botox lips and a ton of make up. 

You complain about your wife tearing down strangers and no longer being a feminist...and continue on to tear down other women for not living life the way YOU value. 

pretty hypocritical, I'd say."
47,2020-02-05 08:40:13,ez33e7,"That's a weird turn she's taken for sure. Aside from talking about it though there's probably not much you can do?

I'd be pretty upset if one day my vibrant SO became judgmental and overly interested in other people's / celebrities lives as a hobby. It's honestly just extremely weird and off putting along with the rude remarks about other people. I'd most likely start to view them as ugly on the inside and any attraction left would die out pretty quick.

If that's not something you like or can deal with without it negatively affecting your relationship, you're in for a long, annoying ride."
48,2020-02-05 14:21:00,ez33e7,"I like the comment about what do you love about her.  I also recognize that you both have a pattern of judging others, hers just doesn‚Äôt align with yours now, but at the core what you did before is what she is doing now.  

I would suggest you focus on living your best life, learning and connecting to yourself.  Always invite her along on the journey.  Don‚Äôt judge her about what she is doing, but instead perhaps you can reach an agreement about where you want to go.  

You might be surprised."
49,2020-02-05 11:05:26,ez33e7,"Honestly? She sounds like she actually hasn‚Äôt changed that much fundamentally. You both bonded over being judgmental assholes, and now she‚Äôs still doing exactly that, just in a slightly different way. 

You act sad that she gossips about physical appearance, yet you do the exact same thing (please explain to me exactly how someone‚Äôs platinum blond hair affects you personally?) 

It‚Äôs not that she‚Äôs gotten mean, because you both used to be mean (if the old her would have ‚Äúkicked the shit‚Äù out of the new her, perhaps she was never very nice) It‚Äôs that you‚Äôve deemed her new interests shallow, and use that to make yourself feel deep. 

I honestly think you two deserve each other, I can‚Äôt imagine a worse couple to be around."
50,2020-02-05 11:38:00,ez33e7,"It can get exhausting to be thinking deeply about the world all the time, and acting in accordance. I think you can take some judgement out of the hobby itself but focus on the effects. Eg. ‚ÄúIt makes me sad when you say mean things about your appearance or the appearance of others‚Äù"
51,2020-02-05 05:57:05,ez33e7,"Most people in their late 30s do not have time to make art like they did at 20. Op, some of tour critism is really weird."
52,2020-02-05 07:25:27,ez33e7,"This is the definition of growing apart. It's okay. One of you just needs to acknowledge and decide if you're willing to be in a relationship that you no longer desire to be a part of or if you're going to stay because ""it's the right thing to do"".

Let her know your feelings and take it from there."
53,2020-02-05 10:36:00,ez33e7,"> She stares into the mirror and talks about how ugly and fat she is getting.  
  
She cares more about looks and appearances now. That is not necessarily a bad thing per se, a lot of it is simply keeping your skin and body healthy. How about you go to the gym together and/or take a sports class? Would that give you a feeling of personal accomplishment? How about you go to a spa together, but on a condition of ""no celebrity talk""? Instead maybe she'll tell you about the mechanisms of the different treatments? I find them fascinating, personally.  
  
e: and stop being anti-makeup. Makeup is a visual art as well. Have you seen the works of those artists who created makeup to combat facial recognition cameras?"
54,2020-02-05 04:59:31,ez33e7,"So she works and does everything around the house? What do you do?

Maybe she doesn't have the energy for art anymore, since she has to do all the cleaning and cooking and managing the house. On top of a job."
55,2020-02-05 11:07:27,ez33e7,"She was pretending to be the ""cool girl"" early on. A lot of young women do this because society teaches us we shouldn't be proud of being normal women. We have to be the cool girl.  You know the one. ""I'm not like other girls. I'm deep and smart and never jealous or petty. I'm a cool girl.""  Except she isn't magically better than other women. As we get older, putting on the cool girl act gets tiring and you just want to be a normal person. 

You are not a real feminist ally if you can only accept one type of female personality."

&#x200B;

It's sad to see somebody go but its clear that you guys took different directions."
57,2020-02-05 13:08:40,ez33e7,"It could have started from her work culture - wanting to fit in, not wanting to be the weirdo, being made fun of, wanting to keep up with the chatter at work. And then it likely descended into... that. Celebrity mags can be a drug - I was into that as a teenager and outgrew it. 

I‚Äôm wondering if she feels she grew up too fast and missed out on a real adolescence? Because this sounds like the female version of a mid-life crisis.

Have you said things to her like ‚ÄúI miss it when we used to do ____ together,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI miss hearing you play X instrument, you were so good...‚Äù maybe this will give her the confidence to reboot again. But in terms of her newfound interests... it could be anything - work culture, feelings of missing out on an adolescence, fears of no longer being able to be her pretty carefree self due to feeling her looks deteriorate with age, etc - but the best thing to do is try to build her confidence and show unconditional support, or, as others have said, find a new joint hobby to build back the connection. 

I had an ex I dated between 19 and 24 and he became a different person. I didn‚Äôt like this new person and fell out of love with him because he was unrecognizable from the man I‚Äôd fallen in love with. After the breakup we both went with people who represented the person we had become - and they‚Äôre polar opposites.  

People change, I seldom see that extreme a change but it happens. Don‚Äôt feel bad if you‚Äôre no longer in love with her. If you have to end it to feel whole again, consider couples therapy and if the differences are too much to bridge, and not the kind of differences you can embrace (I don‚Äôt blame you) then it might be time to cut the Ford while you‚Äôre still young enough to start new lives with other people."
58,2020-02-05 13:53:15,ez33e7,"This is from someone that is not similar to you and your wife but went through the same transformation as her. I wasn't an artist but there was a thing I did and then I mostly stopped caring about the thing and now I like celebrity gossip and looks and I love to date and marry one of the platinum blonde, botoxed crowd (I'm a dude, about ten years older than you). 

I didn't do my thing because I loved it, while I enjoyed it and it gave me a sense of purpose, the underlying, unrealized motivation was that I did it to be loved, to be cherished as one of the shiny happy people they show on TV and invite to various projects and initiatives (my thing was as political as it was creative). 

And when that never really happened, I started to envy people who made it, or who made it without having to really do it, like the Jersey Shore crowd. The emotion that undermines all this is envy, I don't know what your wife does for a living but for sure I've never expected I'd be stuck in the office in my forties, even if it pays well and I mostly have nothing to worry about. And the office is on the 40th floor with a grant vista of the whole city. But I don't want to be here, and I have nowhere else really to go, as my thing fizzled politically and the only ones still caring about it are (as your wife described them) real life losers. They are not the shiny happy people I wanted to join.

So, try talking to your wife about her dreams and motivations that drove her art. She may not be really aware about them (it took years of therapy to realize what I wrote above). Discuss what do you want from yourself and your lives. I'd suggest at least discussion of having children as this gives a major sense of life purpose.

Good luck."
59,2020-02-05 11:32:25,ez33e7,"> We have talked about it at length, but she seems happy in her world there.

I am extremely curious about why, in a many - paragraphs long description of your thoughts on this issue, her thoughts and explanations are mentioned only this once, and never actually given. Seems pretty crucial to the issue *why* this change has happened. 

 It doesn't sound to me like her actual personality changed much at all. The old person you describe is someone who attacked things and people she didn't like, who went after friends (""chiding"") to express superiority. Maybe I'm wrong but she sounds like she was kind of a hipster mean girl, and now she's a mainstream mean girl. Why would you expect someone who made fun of pop music to not make fun of indie music once her tastes changed?

> tearing down other women in really petty ways

> Instead of going to volunteer at soup kitchens like she did before, they sip mimosas and go to meet influencers to take photos

> She has become the girl that takes 150 selfies that all look the exact same

seems to run in the family, huh

> i still feel very strongly about many of the fundamentals, like tolerance and acceptance, individualism, and just general passion about life... My wife however, has found celebrities.

you do realize these two things are not in any way exclusive of each other, right? You do understand that you're doing the exact same thing she's doing to your friends who make sad music in their dark apartments?"

WAS: so depressed that she slowly came out of it and is confident enough to care how she looks & feels sad for her old friends who are still so depressed that they are still frumpy & playing/making poor music hiding their depression in that music."
62,2020-02-05 14:33:45,ez33e7,"Since you 'go along to get along' now as well I don't see why you're so surprised that she does the same. You sold out, bro."
63,2020-02-05 13:22:11,ez33e7,"I probably have less experience with relationships than half of this thread, but maybe she just lost that constant conflict in her normal life, so she uses other people's lives to still have that conflict."
64,2020-02-05 15:09:20,ez33e7,"This is difficult, and unless there's some underlying issue that caused the change, it's possible that you two just aren't compatible anymore.  


I do wonder if the core traits have always been there, but she used to exhibit them in ways you agreed with. So, she used to criticize her friends for shopping at chain stores and eating meat, and now she criticizes them for being a certain size or ""frumpy"". Maybe she has always been judgmental, but you notice it more now that she's applying it to things you disagree with.  


I will say that, while I don't like to make generalizations, I think social media has the potential to bring out the worst in people. It's almost like a virus or addiction, the way some are effected by it. I wonder if she has always sought validation and this is a way for her to easily get it.  


When you talk about it, does she agree that she's changed? Do you push back against her insulting or gossiping about others?"
65,2020-02-05 15:11:24,ez33e7,"I would recommend just starting with the really judgmental behavior on your wife's part. Pointing it out- gently, but openly and consistently- when she makes rude comments. Over time she may come to an awareness about how often she does this and how inappropriate it is. Once she comes to this awareness hopefully she will start to realize which of the media/people around her are toxic and consciously resist it, or maybe even start to correct or weed them out.

Does she still enjoy painting and volunteering? If she likes them but can't find the energy to do them that could be a sign of depression (it doesn't always take the form of pronounced sadness- it can be signaled by a loss of engagement in things that used to bring you joy, tiredness and lack of executive function, self-sabotaging social habits or loss of self-esteem.) You would know better than any of us if she may actually be depressed, of course, but there is no harm in bringing up the potential of therapy or simply helping to instigate these activities if she also views it as a problem that she is no longer doing these things. (Sorry if any of this advice is repetitive, I didn't get through the entire comment section before posting.)

Best of luck!"
66,2020-02-05 15:32:10,ez33e7,"Sounds to me like her friends are heavily infuencing her negatively. My sister is somewhat like this (bless her heart) she gets very influenced by those she spends time with. Perhaps in the beginning she was also being influenced to act the way she did and you didn‚Äôt know it yet, you thought it was the real her. Some people have a very weak moral compass and rely on others to decide for them how to act and dress and feel by mimicking them. It‚Äôs common in nature. This comment probably wasn‚Äôt helpful at all so sorry for that and I hope you can have a solid 1 on 1 chat and be open with each other :)"
67,2020-02-05 15:33:00,ez33e7,"I can sort of relate to your wife. When I was in my early 20s, I was also into activism and eventually fell off that. It's tiring to always have to be * aware * and it can really limit what you can do - ""I can't eat/do this because it doesn't use ethical practices"" etc. You also tend to get really judgy of others - which you did: ""rant to others about the atrocities of the meat industry, or chide friends for shopping at chain stores instead of local shops"".

She might also be experiencing a mid-life crisis. I'm a few years older than you and I'm also starting to notice my grey hairs and wrinkles and feel like I have to do something about those. Even I get sucked into having to buy anti-wrinkle cream, etc. Unfortunately I don't have more to add to this but I'm sure that ""women experiencing a mid-life crisis and fear of losing their beauty"" is part of what's going on here. Maybe post to r/askwomen about their experiences of reaching middle age to get some insight into what your wife is going through?"
68,2020-02-05 12:16:10,ez33e7,"As women age, their value to society seems to decrease and they fade into the background because their looks may begin to change. Your wife might be feeling this intensely. That‚Äôs why she is concentrating on her looks, and hanging out with women who spend more time on keeping up appearances. That and the celebrity obsession could be her way of trying to figure out how these women in their 30s stay relevant. 

However, I have to say it‚Äôs surprising that her emotional maturity is regressing...one would think with time and experience, she would recognize the value of her hobbies and inner strengths rather than becoming hyper focused on superficial stuff.

How do you relay your opinions of women‚Äôs appearances to her? Is there anything you may be doing/saying to make her insecure?"
69,2020-02-05 15:45:44,ez33e7,"Bingo.  She was always on a high horse, she just changed the one she was riding."

I think thats one thing that is most upsetting about her new hobbies. I dont want to be judgemental about how a person spends their time, but i honestly believe deep down that being inundated and surrounded by celebrities and such focus on the superficial has a negative affect on a person, and that seems to be the case that is coming out with my wife now. 

I totally get the getting exhausted with activism thing. i definitely am not nearly as active with it as i used to be, especially with a ""normal life"" of work and bills and stuff. So i get needing some down time and time to just check out. I just wish it was something that didnt negatively affect her view of herself, and/or affect her view of the people around her in a negative way.  

But on the other hand that seems a bit controlling of me to want to limit her exposure to a new hobby of hers. which is why im conflicted.

thank you for your suggestions that i will definitely try."
78,2020-02-05 14:05:52,ez33e7,This is such a wise comment.
79,2020-02-05 14:14:28,ez33e7,Eh I think there are planets of people who are happy and love to tear down people. OP‚Äôs wife might not be the case but they did tear down other people in their youth too just for different things.
80,2020-02-05 12:41:22,ez33e7,"I am, frankly, concerned about her mental health. OP might suggest they see a counselor together.

That said, there's nothing wrong with fascination on celebrities, or anything else - as long as you don't obsess and lose sight of your core self."

82,2020-02-05 04:08:51,ez33e7,"Yeah, i dont know if thats common for people to do, but im not really of the type to throw away a 15 year relationship with the person i love more than anything else in the world over the fact that i disagree greatly with her hobbies and time spending habits."
83,2020-02-05 04:01:54,ez33e7,"Yes, we have talked many times, and at some length. But she seems quite happy with it. She disagrees about her getting more dramatic or negative/mean, and other than the argument of ""i think celebrity worship is pointless"" i dont have a lot else to go on.

84,2020-02-05 08:21:37,ez33e7,That information just turned my life upside down. I don't know what to do with myself. What will I do now? What am I supposed to care about now? Climate???! Politics?! My own problems?????!!!! NO!

90,2020-02-05 05:09:05,ez33e7,"I would agree but in this case it‚Äôs coming from a place of incompatibility. If his wife was like this 10 years ago, they wouldn‚Äôt be with each other. She changed or grew out of whatever she was that attracted him while he remained the same. It‚Äôs an  unfortunate situation."
91,2020-02-05 06:07:11,ez33e7,"I think the point of that line was to say that she and her friends are very into their physical appearances, not to say that women with platinum hair and lip filler are dumb."
92,2020-02-05 06:04:08,ez33e7,"He's not tearing his wife down because she isn't a feminist anymore. Admiring dyed hair, botix lips and a ton of make up (along with her celebrity obsession) are really fundamental personality changes. They are especially relevant to the question he's asking about their compatibility because he specifically doesn't like these traits in a person, and he married someone who also didn't like them."
93,2020-02-05 08:09:57,ez33e7,Lol how. He's just noting a difference. He's not tearing or judging anyone
94,2020-02-05 10:36:27,ez33e7,"that wasnt a negative comment or tearing them down. That is literally the truth, they literally have platinum blonde hair, a ton of make up and botox. There was no tearing down or anything, just describing how completely different ideals and lifestyles they have than her old friends."
95,2020-02-05 08:28:11,ez33e7,Oh don't be so dense
96,2020-02-05 11:29:20,ez33e7,"Ding ding! OP bonded when the judgemental values aligned with his own but now he doesn't like it because the judgement has changed.

I have learned the hard way that if you bond over negativity with people, that negativity will unravel you at some point. I think it's ok to have a few injokes about things you dislike, maybe that neighbour you both find tricky, the TV show that baffles you but everyone else loves but the majority of your relationship needs to be bound in positivity to survive otherwise it will eat you alive.

It also sounds like the OP is feeling left out that he's lost his partner in nastiness and can't indulge fully so is resentful. There's quite a few misogynistic dogwhistles in his comments so I also wonder how much he's switched that judgement toward his wife and she's feeling that resentment and it's pulling them apart without him realising.

I'd recommend some couples therapy and finding some positive stuff to bond over even if it's watching re-runs of the British Bake Off and admiring middle aged people getting passionate about jam and cake instead of women screaming at each other on telly. Lead by example OP which means both of them do the work to save this marriage (or work out how to break up well because I sense OP could get bitter about being dumped by a vapid blonde when he deserves a manic pixie dream girl.)"
97,2020-02-05 14:11:05,ez33e7,"This is exactly what I got out of the post too. OP is just as judgemental and mean as he says his wife is, just about different things. He was fine with how she acted back then, because they were in their own echo chamber, parroting the same opinions back and forth.

Now she's branched out, changed some opinions, and has started liking things he doesn't, and he's acting like she's suddenly turned into a mean, critical person. No, she's always been mean, OP just didn't care before because their negativity aligned.

Both of them sound exhausting to be around."
98,2020-02-05 06:11:53,ez33e7,"Exactly. He said himself she maintains the house well and makes a good living. Her priorities have clearly changed and it‚Äôs not a bad thing that she no longer feels the need to make her own jewelry or volunteer at soup kitchens. It sounds like he is romanticizing the past a little bit. He should of fallen in love with her core, not her interests."
99,2020-02-05 10:53:44,ez33e7,"I think you might be missing the main point. Its not about if she makes art or not, its that she has changed fundamentally. Im ok if she makes less art, or if she goes from painting to writing. Or most anything else. Its not 100% about the specific hobby.  My issue is how her new hobbies have affected her personality, and her core values."
100,2020-02-05 12:10:44,ez33e7,And since she is an artist it‚Äôs a completely natural thing for her to want to play around with makeup and enhance her features. It can be for vanity or for fun.
101,2020-02-05 10:44:20,ez33e7,"I do all the cooking in the house. I do the grocery shopping. I also have a full time job, and i manage the bills and money. I also generally take care of the pets (feed, walk, etc). I handle the anything that needs fixed as well, like car repairs and appointments.  She does the housecleaning, the laundry, and the organization. and she does decoration and any interior stuff. 

I totally understand if she is exhausted and has less time for art. Im not so much pushing specifically for her to spend hours a day doing art anymore. Its more, what she fills her time with now, and how it affects her personality."
102,2020-02-05 12:41:12,ez33e7,"How is it judgemental to see something negatively affecting the person i love and want something better for her?  Again, its not the specific hobbies thats the problem, its the complete 180 change, and the fact that its making her negative about herself and others.  If art was making her feel terrible about herself, or she started making mean and petty insults at other artists i would also have an issue with that hobby as well. The specific hobby isnt the issue, the personality that is apparently coming with it is the issue."
103,2020-02-05 04:05:56,ez33e7,"Maybe. only she doesnt really fit the criteria of it. I mean, how can you convince someone they are depressed when they are a happy, well adjusted person, with a lot of friends, active lifestyle, and hobbies they enjoy. I mean that pretty much describes everyone. That was the way she was when i met her, and thats the way she is now. The only difference is that her ideals and hobbies are completely different.  But there is nothing wrong with changing over the course of 15 years, and not all changes are particularly concerning from a psychological aspect."

105,2020-02-05 17:10:51,ez33e7,"I mean the only reason I saw it straight away is cos I‚Äôm a super critical, judgemental person too. I do try not to be though. I think it‚Äôs natural to want to feel better than others to an extent and everyone judges at times depending on what their morals are. It‚Äôs just important to not see the issues in isolation which I think is OP‚Äôs wife‚Äôs problem. She thinks whatever she believes in/likes is right and makes her better than others, even though over time the specifics change and can even be contradictory (like feminism and then heavily judging other women on things like looks).

I always try and think of it as like, I‚Äôm a vegetarian and sometimes I feel upset at people not making more choices to eat less meat. But then I remind myself that a) I could be vegan so there‚Äôs always ways of ‚Äòbeing better‚Äô than I currently am and b) I also do immoral things like shopping at slave labour clothes shops like Primark. Like could I look down at someone who dedicates their life to, say, supporting and caring for alcoholics because they also eat meat? Maybe in one tiny sense it could be justified but morality is HUGE and there are so many complex ways different people try to help the world. So yeah, maybe wife was a raging feminist but was she a martyr in 100% of her other life choices? Cos if not feeling superior about that is dumb - fight for people to join your cause, sure, but don‚Äôt look down on them and think you‚Äôre worth so much more because you might be great in one sense and terrible in another.

End of soapbox lol!"
106,2020-02-05 14:44:21,ez33e7,"31 one year old female. I had really strong devotion to the arts, and even studied animation. Unfortunately, by my mid twenties, i had enough bad relationships with men, including being preyed on by people in the industry, that i felt like garbage. I try to stay into art...but my strongest memories are of being rejected and objectified and never being sure if it was my art or just my being an attractive 23 year old that was valuable to people. 

I felt (and still feel like) the majority of successful female artist i know are also models/pretty/fashionable. And the majority of people i know who made it in animation are men.

Meanwhile, i feel like i just get older and more and more irrelevant. I guess as a woman, you better have good mental health as you enter your thirties or it will be rough.  

I don‚Äôt find art enjoyable as much and have have switched careers. Now i work a lot to make it in a new field and i am soooo tired. My hobbies are more and more vapid."
107,2020-02-05 12:54:33,ez33e7,">  I just wish it was something that didnt negatively affect her view of herself, and/or affect her view of the people around her in a negative way.

Seems like previously she and you were this way though. You looked negatively upon people who eat meat, chide them into changing their ways, etc. Now instead of it being about their ethical choices, it's about their lack of attention to their own self. Attacking people for their ways or beliefs is fairly normal for people that are prejudice. tbh she sounds like the typical mid 30's mom

For most people the artistic and activism of their youth is just that, a phase. You marry people for who they are though, not who you want them to be. She still very much likes what she likes, you just take issue with what she likes."
108,2020-02-05 16:17:53,ez33e7,"Good luck! :) I think the key balance to strike is being supportive/ trying to help her branch out, without coming off as condescending. An approach which suggests, ""You need new hobbies and interests because I think your current ones are vapid and degrade your character,"" won't be very productive, but I think it's perfectly fine to say, ""I'm not especially interested in this, so I'd like to find other activities/ interests for us to pursue together."" You don't need to control her interests or her behavior with her friends; just ask her to carve out some time for you, where the focus is on something different. It may be that you find some activity that she enjoys so much, that she'll start feeling more confident/fulfilled, and will slowly become less interested in celebrities, etc. 

Also, on the topic of external validation, do you ever tell her how attracted you are to her (physically/ emotionally) unprompted? No matter how independent you are, it feels good to hear those things from the person you love."

At this point it doesn‚Äôt seem like a ‚Äúphase‚Äù and it just seems like you two have grown in different directions which is common.

114,2020-02-05 11:36:44,ez33e7,"I'm not saying divorce her (Jesus Reddit why are you like this). But have you sat down and *talked* to her?? The sitting in front of the mirror talking shit about herself issue seems pretty striking, as does being rude. Plus, if I saw any of my friends abandoning their art, I'd be concerned! That's a really important part of self-therapy in a lot of ways, and you could both probably benefit from re-engaging as a way to reconnect.

There is absolutely nothing wrong with makeup and mimosas, something even me and my college hipster artist friends love. We even watch celebrity shows for shits and giggles. Basically, there's nothing wrong with being in tune with pop culture (something you do seem a bit judgemental about). The issue comes from determining your self worth based on how well you adhere to a certain lifestyle, something true for both being a hardcore hipster (like in your early days), and with celebrity-culture. 

Honestly you can find a middle ground, but only if you're willing to work for it. Relationships mean you are committed not to one person, but the person they evolve to be at each stage of your life. The deal breaker is refusing to work to understand each other. If you feel like she won't listen to you and you can't get past this, counseling is in order. If neither of you are willing to put the time and energy into addressing your differences, then that's a reason to end a relationship."
115,2020-02-05 12:18:15,ez33e7,"I understand where you're coming from - everyone changes over time. But is this a change in hobbies or a change at her core? You said you don't like her anymore as a person, not just her interests. If that's true it's probably harder to overcome. As another person in this thread said, you'd have to learn to accept who she is now. Were you teens/young when you met?"
116,2020-02-05 12:35:49,ez33e7,">im not really of the type to throw away a 15 year relationship with the person i love more

two things

1- the person you USED to love its more accurate.

2- you are not throwing away those years. you lived them and enjoyed them. It's not like if you get to 20 years you get a money prize or a teddy bear. You are in the sunk cost fallacy here, see it like this, wasting even MORE time would be silly wouldn't it?"
117,2020-02-05 04:56:52,ez33e7,Do you just think celebrity worship is pointless or is it more like pathetic/cringeworthy/??? ? That distinction means a lot for this relationship going forward.
118,2020-02-05 05:49:09,ez33e7,"I don't follow pop culture, and while I agree that celebrity worship is pointless, so are many other hobbies. Commenting negatively on someone's appearance, especially facial features though, that is something I cannot get pass. Your wife has become mean, and I think it is a valid point to discuss with her."
119,2020-02-05 07:49:30,ez33e7,"Have you tried calling her out when it happens, like ""that's kind of shallow, hun.""  ""She looks fine to me, don't judge other people.""  ""No need to be rude to the waiter."""
120,2020-02-05 04:02:48,ez33e7,That's really sad.  Maybe some couples counseling would help provide an unbiased opinion onto the situation.
121,2020-02-05 09:30:54,ez33e7,Celebrity culture is vain and judgy and your wife might be taking her own fear of  growing older and being inadequate out on other people. My ex wife was the same
122,2020-02-05 16:01:02,ez33e7,this is why i can‚Äôt stand hipsters. they have no more substance than the ‚Äúcatty plastic mean girls‚Äù he complains about.
123,2020-02-05 14:09:13,ez33e7,"It seems that you two have both been very judgmental people in general in your relationship. First being the ‚Äúhippy-dippy, holier than thou‚Äù judgmental types and now she is being what you call a more ‚Äúshallow ‚Äú judgmental type. It‚Äôs very hypocritical that you are upset that she is no longer the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù type of judgmental. Maybe work on being a less judgmental individual yourself and she will follow suit."
124,2020-02-05 14:01:11,ez33e7,It actually does come across as judgmental which you admit a trait you  and your wife to have exhibited in the past. So here is another perspective. Your wife hasn‚Äôt changed. Previously her self image was low and she didn‚Äôt consider herself conventionally attractive so instead she criticized those conventions and made fun of people that cared about those things that were popular. She carved a niche for herself where she could be special and unique and morally superior. You admit to belittling people for their diet and lifestyle choices. However as the years passed her self image improved and now she‚Äôs found herself on the other side of conventionally attractive. So she doesn‚Äôt need to be into all the things she was into before. The only difference in her is she mocks the unconventional now but at her core she hasn‚Äôt really changed.
125,2020-02-05 16:17:53,ez33e7,We can change faults to noticeable changes. But most people wouldn't lose interest in their spouse because their brunch friends are platinum blondes.
126,2020-02-05 11:15:43,ez33e7,People disagree with you. Get over it.
127,2020-02-05 12:19:34,ez33e7,Yes! You put it so much better than I could have. These two people need to put something positive out into the world ASAP.
128,2020-02-05 06:26:46,ez33e7,"It sounds like her core has changed completely, and the changed interests are an expression of that change."
129,2020-02-05 13:08:00,ez33e7,The first half of your post is all about hobbies and her image. It is wholly separate from the 2nd half which is I guess your main point now. You need to see they are separate judgments it‚Äôs you are going to appear shallow - ironic I know.
130,2020-02-05 06:52:04,ez33e7,"Depression doesn‚Äôt look a certain way. In fact on my most depressed times I did the most to appear that I wasn‚Äôt and was making very poor destructive choices for myself. Going out every night, drinking, staying up late and being endlessly social. To a lot of my friends it appeared I was doing well and having a great time but I was depressed because I wasn‚Äôt making art or doing anything of value with my life. It‚Äôs possible she‚Äôs gotten off track or lost sight of herself and this type of version of herself is easiest to maintain with short term happiness goals being collected along the way. It‚Äôs also possible this is just what‚Äôs she‚Äôs into now. I def suggest couples therapy to try and find if there‚Äôs are more nuances to her changed behavior. Therapy never ever hurts."
131,2020-02-05 05:06:25,ez33e7,"But she's become meaner and more critical of herself and others. I don't think it's fair to criticize her for enjoying a bit of celebrity gossip now and then. The thing is that she seems to have internalized it, and is now nasty about how people look, including constantly calling herself fat and ugly. I don't think you're a bad husband for not wanting your wife to treat herself and others with such blatant disrespect."
132,2020-02-05 13:04:28,ez33e7,That‚Äôs why I used the term ‚Äúmay.‚Äù OP is trying to figure out what‚Äôs going on; I‚Äôm throwing out ideas for him to look at. I‚Äôm not blaming the guy for it. Calm yourself.
133,2020-02-05 16:21:33,ez33e7,"I think a lot of people miss that women go through mid-life crises as well, just usually not as obviously as the stereotype of the guy who buys a bright red sports car.

Some women throw themselves entirely into motherhood, losing any identity other than that of ""Mom"".  Some become obsessed with appearance, either chasing looking constantly 25 or judging everyone else to hide their own insecurities.  And some may take one of the other dozen or so paths - maybe obsessing about work, maybe rejecting societal norms entirely, or maybe dedicating themselves 100% to a fitness pursuit like yoga.

Like any other life crisis or change, it becomes problematic when it's all encompassing, and that seems to be the case with OP's wife.  And as with most cases, the best solutions are lots of support, open conversation, and effort from all parties to get back to a healthy place.  Therapy would be helpful, as would positive redirection of energy by OP (the mentioned coffee and picnic dates would be a good start).

She may still enjoy celeb gossip and monthly mimosa brunches once all is said and done, but hopefully the overly negative and critical behaviors can be mitigated and she can be back in a place where she is more comfortable with herself and the world around her."
134,2020-02-05 14:29:33,ez33e7,"Good insight here. The judgment and elitism was always there, OP just didn't mind the targets before."
135,2020-02-05 13:01:23,ez33e7,"that is a great point, and definitely something to think about more. Thank you for that."
136,2020-02-05 09:26:07,ez33e7,"This is the best comment ever. It's how I now live life and I've never been happier.

Also, OP, divorce her. Be happy."
137,2020-02-05 10:50:29,ez33e7,"Beats me. Thats why i made the post. Because i feel lost. 
I cant imagine this is the only relationship that something like this has happened. Like maybe a couple who was super religious got married, and then one decided 10 years down the road they were athiest, and the other still believes strongly.    Or maybe both got married as venture capitalists and had long term wealth goals, and then one of them decides they wanna give all their money away and live as an ascetic or something. 

I guess i was hoping to see if there is a way i am not seeing to grow together, or get over myself and support her, or come to some compromise, etc. Maybe some first hand experiences."
138,2020-02-05 11:08:46,ez33e7,"Thats i guess my issue i was hoping for perspective on. How much of the change is deeper. Its hard to know for sure, but i also think its not fair, or nice, of me to sit there and hope my wife changes so i can like her again."
139,2020-02-05 12:37:23,ez33e7,"This is a great comment thank you. 

I would love to find the middle ground. I dont have to love every hobby of hers, and i dont want to change her if she is not the exact same person she was 15 years ago. I just dont like the negative affects. While i wouldnt choose to sip mimosas and watch instagram videos on my own, id do it with her, except that i see the effect it has, and the conversation always turns catty and negative.  Im not sure how to separate the two. I get how it comes off as maybe thinking i am ""better"", but i have a hard time sitting through a lunch with her friends where at least 90% of the conversation is about others, and their physical attributes and what things they are doing wrong in their life. Thats just not something i find entertaining or useful."
140,2020-02-05 13:00:45,ez33e7,"Im not sure i agree. Lets suppose i left today and filed for divorce. Its not like today is the first day perpetual happiness. Divorces can be long and difficult processes, especially if the other person does not want a divorce. I like being married and having someone around, and i would want to be married again, which means i would have to start over the process of dating and looking, and spending time, possibly years to get to know someone again, and then begin building a life together with them. Even in a good marriage you go through rocky times. While yes, at this very moment, things are not that great between my wife and I, if its salvageable, even if it takes some time, that saves a significant amount of effort, time, money, and life to work on fixing something that was already pretty good before. 


also. its a pretty shitty thing to do to throw someone away who has worked so hard at making a life together just because they have gotten caught up in something that is making a problem."
141,2020-02-05 11:00:26,ez33e7,"Yes, but she usually disagrees. Things like ""rude"" are different with perspective. One persons rude, is another persons standing up for themselves. Or someone might think they are just being honest, and not being mean. Ive definitely brought things up, but mostly we just agree to disagree."
142,2020-02-05 13:10:32,ez33e7,"I guess the first half was more to see if thats concerning at all. Most people change, but not everyone makes such a 180 degree change. So i was just wondering if others thought it was concerning or such a jolting change, or if i was making too big of a deal out of that change. 

The 2nd part is what im really concerned of for her sake though, is how it affects her. I would be just as concerned though if i noticed that her art was making her negative towards others and make petty remarks about others work as well."
143,2020-02-05 14:21:14,ez33e7,">Going out every night, drinking, staying up late and being endlessly social. To a lot of my friends it appeared I was doing well and having a great time but I was depressed 

That's exactly how my fiance dealt with his depression too, before we met. He was going out with friends every night, staying up extremely late, and overloading himself with plans and activities. To most people it looked like he was just a happy extrovert in his element, but he was deeply depressed and was trying to keep it at bay by being around people, because it was at the worst when he was sitting alone at home.

People have an idea that depression means completely isolating yourself and laying in bed all day, too miserable to get up. And for some people that's exactly what depression looks like. But for others, it's how you described; going out all the time and never being alone."
144,2020-02-05 10:57:23,ez33e7,thats a good point. thank you.
145,2020-02-05 14:37:18,ez33e7,So what? We should judge terrible immoral people. The world is a worse place when we don't.
146,2020-02-05 17:31:00,ez33e7,Why jump to divorce before they've even tried to fix it?
147,2020-02-05 11:32:51,ez33e7,I know what you mean. My wife and I have been together for about 12 years. We both drank heavily for years but in the last few years I've gotten into running and drastically reduced how much I drink whereas she hasn't. It's definately made things hard for me mentally
148,2020-02-05 11:09:56,ez33e7,"Work on yourself.  You call her judgemental, but all you've done in this post is heap judgement on her. You don't sound very nkce or fun to be around.  You sound very into yourself. I'd be depressed listening to you talk about how superior your lifestyle is."
149,2020-02-05 13:58:30,ez33e7,"I get it, but there‚Äôs a reason why a lot of people back in the day ended up deeply unhappy and stuck in loveless marriages because divorce was scorned/not allowed. I‚Äôm sorry if that sounds harsh. If you love this woman more than anything and can‚Äôt foresee a divorce being something positive and healthy for both of you, then you NEED to find a way to acceptance. You don‚Äôt need to ‚Äúgrow with her‚Äù because I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre growing in your own unique ways already. But you need to remember why you love her and then the hobbies and interests just become on the side. What about a shared hobby? Trying new things together, some trips? If I were you, I would continue talking to her, but zero in on how you feel when she critiques others appearances. Because hobbies, makeup, and celebrities are one thing, but making fun of appearances is something that is making you question her character and is concerning you because it‚Äôs so different from how you know her character to be. I can‚Äôt imagine she would ignore her husband basically telling her ‚Äúhoney, making fun of peoples physical appearances is mean, not who you are, and deeply unattractive to me.‚Äù And if she really doesn‚Äôt care, well then I‚Äôm sure that will help you come to more clarity."
150,2020-02-05 14:16:57,ez33e7,You need to have an honest talk with her. Let all your feelings known.
151,2020-02-05 15:52:30,ez33e7,"But isn't criticizing people for not being vegan or shopping at the right grocery stores also a catty way of cutting others down? You guys used to bond over looking down on mainstream stuff and the people who liked it. She has always been an elitist, it's just that you no longer agree with what she is an elitist about, and that is allowing you to see how hateful and shallow this sort of behavior is."
152,2020-02-05 13:31:33,ez33e7,"That's the only comment I have seen so far that is reasonable. The divorce comments are what you get in this sub. Unfortunate, wrong, and facile, but that's what you get. Talk to her, accept who she is, and enjoy it. I would address talking about other people, but try to watch some of the nonsense shows even if you don't enjoy them. I am sure she is feeling distance from you. It's ok to watch and enjoy nonsense shows."
153,2020-02-05 15:56:54,ez33e7,"I think you're on the right track identifying your challenge as the separation of the two elements--the interest in pop culture on the one hand, and the negative behavior towards others on the other. But you yourself laid it out, I think, in your post: it's about those ""fundamentals...tolerance and acceptance, individualism, and just general passion about life.""

Set aside ""passion about life""--that can manifest in all kinds of ways, including enjoying different modes of pop culture. The basic values are key: how one treats other people, how one views one's place in society. If you believe she is not embodying those key values in certain ways, values you once shared, then that's where you want to focus your conversation. Though I don't recommend just saying ""hey I think you're increasingly immoral""--more like, create opportunities to have general conversations about the world and how one should live in it. To the extent possible, have general, philosophical conversations as an *add-on*, not as a substitute for the stuff she's interested in. That way it's more time for you together, rather than trying to set up a competition between the two.

People contain multitudes. The woman you loved is most likely still there, but we get more complex and contradictory as we age. Some of the best, most passionate and socially committed people I know are also into pro wrestling, or baseball, or fashion. I tend to share your discomfort with celebrity/pop culture, but I try to check my judgment of people who are into it, because in my thirties I rediscovered my interest in watching football, and I've realized that when I think or chat about the roster dynamics of the Seattle Seahawks, I'm not doing anything much different than people who talk about the interpersonal dynamics of celebrities. We all have our things. I'll admit I sometimes use football to escape from thinking about the extraordinarily fucked-up world we live in, but that's because if I spent all my time thinking about it, I'd be horrifically boring and/or completely fucking bonkers with rage. We all need to leaven our worthy passions with trivial ones--that's how we survive.

Just talk to her. About core values. You separate the values from the pop culture interest by just...keeping them separate. If you make them the same thing, she'll see you as judging her. If you separate them, you'll find out whether the person you love is still there or not. I'm making the hopeful bet that she is."
154,2020-02-05 13:31:36,ez33e7,"It doesnt seem like just her ""hobbies"" have changed. It seems like she now has a completely different outlook and view on life. 

In the past she would have chosen a soup kitchen, and now if you recommend it, she might make fun of homeless people or criticize their decisions. 

That first person has empathy, love, caring. That second person is slefish, self loathing, superficial etc..

It's totally possible for one person to fall out of love with another person because they change. You may love your wife but you love her because of the old her. 

If you met her NOW, would you want to date her? Would you want to spend your life with her? The only life you have?

My advice is you need to have a more in depth serious discussion about this. She could try to change a bit, and you could try to change a bit, and honestly that's how long term relationships work. It's up to you to decide how long you're going to stay in HOPING she will return to being the person you fell for. You could waste the rest of your life waiting for a moment that most likely will never come. On the opposite end you can say that you've had a wonderful 15 years, and learned alot, but just as life constantly changes so does love. 

What if you met a little hippy musician, who had her own little hippy garden that she made dishes from. Maybe she still knits and sees her own clothing and enjoys concerts and political events/rallies. I mean you could find exactly what makes you happy, instead of HOPING you'll one day like her again.

I think if you're honest with yourself you'll find you do love her, but you love who she was. You like who she was but you dont like who she is now. So you talk about it or change the situation. 

I couldn't imagine 30 to 40 more years with someone I have almost nothing in common with, and all those things you dislike about her will slowly grate on you and cause resentment.

What if you have kids and she teaches them about celebrities and gossip, and how to look beautiful? Instead of teaching your kids about sustainability, empathy, love....

Best of luck."
155,2020-02-05 13:05:20,ez33e7,">Even in a good marriage you go through rocky times. 

man this is not a rocky time, you despise what she became. She is literally representing stuff you hate! Look some people are similar when young, but some people are just doing it to rebel  and some really believe it. Other do believe it but they realize that being against most society is too tiring and they rather be on the other side.

&#x200B;

Not sure on which team she is in but she is not on yours clearly. She is not binging on a tv show you dont like for 2 days, this is what she is becoming. Young people often become different adults, it seems the case here.

I‚Äôm confident should would of been successful either way as a lawyer or something but the amount of money she has made is ridiculous and undeserved. Justin on the other hand is a talented musician. Like him or not he EARNED his money with people buying his songs and seeing him in concert. Kim K is not a performer. She‚Äôs no more special than an Instagram influencer

The reason of the comments is that altough the theory started in Reddit a Spanish youtuber might have popularized it. After a quick google search the only articles talking about this are from latinx/hispanic websites, this could be because US outlets might think of pizzagate as a dumb fake topic but for a lot of latin america this is the first time they hear about it.

234,2020-02-04 19:46:43,eyv218,">Longtime manager Scooter Braun calls the years from 19-21 a ""really dark period,"" during which other members of Bieber's circle say they also stepped away as the singer made a series of bad decisions that included drag racing, DUI, assault, excessive partying and generally boorish behavior. ""He's gone through a lot in a very short life,"" says Braun. ""You don't always agree with someone's decisions in that moment. They're young people making very big decisions that affect a lot of people. And sometimes in those scenarios you're going to make the right decisions. Sometimes you're gonna make wrong.""

scooter talking as though his insane touring schedule and working his clients like a dog doesn't play a part in their shitty mental health lmao"
235,2020-02-04 20:02:53,eyv218,"I guess I would be more sympathetic if he was talking about this in between album cycles. Even a year ago, I would have taken this a bit more seriously.

It's interesting that we expect authenticity, openness, and relatability when artists are promoting their music, yet they also walk the line of coming across manufactured and disgenuine because we know it's just for promo. 

I wish it weren't the case, but I have a hard time believing that those ""dark days"" are over for Justin. His eyes look tired and cold. His face is gaunt and sunken. 
I admit that I am unwilling to take his claim of lyme disease at face value. Is that because I inherently don't trust JB? Is that because of the rampant rumours that a lot of celebrities use illnesses such as these to hide addiction? 

It bothers me that I don't believe him. As much as I think he's a shithead, I really do feel for him and believe his response to such a high level of fame at such a young age is the norm, not the exception. I sincerely hope that he can resolve whatever demons he struggles with."
236,2020-02-04 19:28:04,eyv218,is it terrible that it's really hard to muster any sympathy for him?
237,2020-02-04 23:49:25,eyv218,"..... Although this is really sad and I know I am suppose to sympathize with Justin and feel bad for him, I just sort of don't? I just don't think he's a good person. And I don't think his excessive drug use through his teens excuses a lot of shitty behavior over years, just like that.

I also don't think he's completely well. It looks like he is still recovering. His face is sunken in, he looks out of it and tired the majority of the time. Is this really the time Scooter should be trying to capitalize on him through a crazy tour schedule, promo appearances, etc right now? This is also all coming out days before his new album."

242,2020-02-05 05:35:25,eyv218,"I think as some other people have said, the worst thing about this whole ""I was in a dark place"" thing is that I don't buy it. He's IN a dark place, he didn't get out of one. He may have escaped a much darker situation but acting like now he's fine and it's all in the past when he's so clearly not is so disingenuous and everybody is just letting it happen. Scooter is the fucking devil, first of all, and if I ever meet him I'm spitting in his face, because wow what a fucking predator he is, and we all know he knows it. Money is the only language he speaks, which would be fine if he wasn't out here acting like he's so compassionate and loving in public and throwing up his Mother Theresa act like we don't see through it.

I hope Justin is just okay in the long run, I hope he escapes the bullshit and forms a new identity or life. It doesn't have to be outside the fame, but he does have to learn to navigate the fame without letting it consume and destroy him, and he's going to need a better support system than this. When I look at him now I just see someone being taken advantage of, and it makes me sad."

i'm not a native english speaker so i thought this meant that one of his bad decisions was doing drag. i had to google it because i didn't remember justin ever being in drag and them i was like Ahhhh at the results that came up. 

i was also like ""how are they comparing doing drag with assault? that's fucked up"""
248,2020-02-05 05:23:01,eyv218,"I don't wanna fucking know that Bieber was drag racing unless they can tell me if he won or not, too. Did he at least win? Now the rumours of him being in the next Fast and Furious make sense tho."
249,2020-02-04 21:04:58,eyv218,exactly this. is it sad? sure. but i don‚Äôt buy any of this because he is releasing a new album in literally ten days. nothing he could say at this point can be taken from a point of being honest and open.
250,2020-02-05 15:51:40,eyv218,"He doesn't look ready for another big album campaign and tour (strange considering Purpose was 2015 and the tour ended in 2017) or that his heart is really in it. He had the drive to prove himself to everyone with Purpose, but this time it feels like the label are pushing him into the new era and he's having to go along with it."
251,2020-02-05 14:04:16,eyv218,"I don‚Äôt think his dark days are over at all considering the rampant desperation he showed when promoting his new song. Like yes I get all big pop artists are concerned with that stuff, but the desperation he showed was a little frightening and uncomfortable."
252,2020-02-04 20:23:01,eyv218,"I mean, to each their own feelings and interpretations. JB might not have a great personality but the way he's become an ill-adjusted, confused and struggling child prodigy gone wrong is troubling and too similar to previous cases in the entertainment industry. It very rarely goes right from here on out, and he needs a safety net that's not some sort of creepy new-age church or a money vulture manager looking to profit off of him. At this age, MJ was the biggest star but also admitted to deep loneliness and feeling out of place in the world, having built very few real human relationships. The reality that people like them grow up in, is different than ours. Of course he's privileged, spoiled, a bit of a jerk - but all of those things only contribute to how crappy his celebrity lifestyle eventually must be for his mental wellbeing."
253,2020-02-04 19:34:19,eyv218,I find myself more fascinated than sympathetic. I think everyone knew Bieber was gonna crash and burn ever since he blew up. I feel like that was always the notion. Fame as a concept is truly terrifying
254,2020-02-04 20:13:34,eyv218,"I mean, yeah? He‚Äôs a child star who got trapped in the cycle of drug abuse that so many of them fall into while the public just gawks at them. Plus in Bieber‚Äôs case he was super hated by a very vocal group of people even before his ‚Äúdownfall.‚Äù"
255,2020-02-04 19:45:02,eyv218,"Yes and No. On one hand, he's the poster boy for privilege. He's had it all at a very young age & this success poisoned his mind. He was surrounded by too many 'yes' men & his friends were with him because he was Bieber; they were essentially coattails. There was nothing genuine in his life and that's got to hurt. Plus, he was worked to death by his managers & labels trying to squeeze every last cent out of him and that has to be exhausting. Fame is addicting too & that's all these teen celebs know (see: Selena, Demi, Miley, Lindsay, Amanda etc.) 

On the other hand, it's too convenient that all of this info is surfacing when he's dropping an album. That's why most people feel iffy (cynic) about everything he's saying. He's using his afflictions to promote an album. It doesn't feel like it's genuine; this is just another tactic on the whiteboard for his team."
256,2020-02-04 21:56:30,eyv218,"Does the sympathy only come once he ODs? I'm asking because it's a similar sentiment I've seen on here and twitter w/Demi. Like the same kind of comments and then when she almost died people were all of a sudden sympathetic.

Now that she's sober it's more or less the same old unsympathetic angle again.

No shade, I just find it fascinating."
257,2020-02-04 20:00:27,eyv218,"yeah, kinda"
258,2020-02-05 00:32:30,eyv218,I'm curious how did you fall into it? Was in your circle of friends or did it happen when you drank excessively and just spiraled.
259,2020-02-04 20:09:52,eyv218,right? he‚Äôs always been a terrible person
260,2020-02-04 20:31:48,eyv218,really wish he would‚Äôve said something more like ‚Äúa lot of people struggle with substance use even as teenagers‚Äù instead. but maybe that‚Äôs just because i do substance use work with kids lol.
261,2020-02-04 21:07:33,eyv218,Lol I know! When I was a teen idk where I would‚Äôve gotten drugs even if I wanted them ü§£
262,2020-02-04 22:10:12,eyv218,">I hate that he says it's ""normal"" for teens to do a bunch of drugs. No, it's not.

In my personal experience, it is extremely normalized to do ""a bunch of drugs"" as a teen. As a person coming from the burbs in the USA, there is a huge drug epidemic issue that is being swept under the rug and stigmatized. In my hometown, it's like a couple kids die from ODing every season. 

I don't think he was trying to promote drug use or make it ""ok"", but to show the stark reality of drug use. It's a sad reality, IMO. There has been [reports](https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20191115.977344/full/) showing how drug use among [adolescents/young adult has increased dramatically over the years in the US](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2719580). And IDK, I remember clear as day having school assemblies every month in HS about refusing peer pressure from party drugs/etc. and seeing stories on how former students died from ODing. Drug use during teen years is seen as a pastime."
263,2020-02-04 22:21:36,eyv218,You‚Äôd be surprised. I‚Äôm 19 and probably around half of my friends smoke weed and do MDMA regularly. It may be different in different places but at least where i live drug use among teenagers is extremely common.
264,2020-02-05 04:19:05,eyv218,I'm a senior and definitely the majority of people I know are drug users.
265,2020-02-05 00:06:43,eyv218,Britney never really did anything to be hated though. Bieber has a resume of being shitty to everyone around him. üßë‚Äçüíª
266,2020-02-05 04:08:44,eyv218,"I agree with you, but I think the difference is that Britney never used her struggles to make money or promote an album. She kept it very personal, whereas Justin‚Äôs only talking about this on a YouTube documentary or in exclusive interviews featuring his manager. Similar with Demi, where people were starting to feel like she was milking it until she OD‚Äôed and it made people stop and think. 

Not saying he deserves the hate, just pointing out a difference I see."
267,2020-02-07 01:42:04,eyv218,he probably really thinks he is out of this dark place
268,2020-02-05 03:58:39,eyv218,He hasn‚Äôt done anything to Taylor ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
269,2020-02-04 21:00:57,eyv218,lol probably because the show ‚Äúdrag race‚Äù is a pun on the terms for professional race cars and doing drag aka men dressing as women

272,2020-02-04 20:21:15,eyv218,"Yes and the hatred was people wanting to harm him and it was seen as perfectly acceptable when he was a child. He also had no parental figure besides Braun when his fame took off, and his mom worked multiple jobs before he got rich and famous. Not surprised by how his life took this turn."

275,2020-02-05 00:29:19,eyv218,No wants to see young people caught up in the industry and fame killed. I think it a mix of tough love and the boy who cry's wolf... you have all the tools and resources to get out of this situation. But the pressures of life and fame can be tough. Corey Monteith is another example
276,2020-02-05 14:12:25,eyv218,"it‚Äôs not even that I don‚Äôt have sympathy, it‚Äôs just that I was hoping for him to actually recover after that statement where he revealed he has done a lot of drugs. but then....we get this era, with him pretending as if he‚Äôs ‚Äúcleaned up‚Äù and it just gets tiring"
277,2020-02-05 00:37:43,eyv218,"Unfortunately, my recreational group of friends who loved to rave led me to meeting and falling in love with an abusive drug addict. 

I was just a rec user and standard partier at that age before meeting him, and that‚Äôs when the lifestyle took over my life for a few years. Wasn‚Äôt until i got a restraining order and sought out help before I recovered. And now I haven‚Äôt touched any drug, and only drink occasionally, for the last 4 years! Definitely the lowest most scary part of my life, so I always sympathize with people who have struggled with something similar as well!"
278,2020-02-05 05:30:02,eyv218,"When I was a teen (like 6 years ago lol) we/I were buying drugs literally in front of our high school. That's where you get your drugs, you go to school and go to the smokers pit lol. Someone will have them. I swear teachers would see drug deals going down and look away cause they couldn't do shit, and cops would drive by or walk past giant clouds of pot smoke and ignore it because even though they know everybody is smoking and popping pills and dropping acid, they're only interested in the suppliers and dealers most of the time, so they had no response to most of us partying. Of course we all knew weed legalization was around the corner by that point, but I'm sure they knew other drugs were going around too. 

I was always just a stoner so it wasn't serious for me but my friends were taking whatever they could get, always mentioning some new street drug I'd never heard of, etc, and sadly it's very easy to get. Even had to cutout  some people I'd been friends with since second grade after they threatened to drug me without me knowing one day. Teens today have some fucked up choices to make."
279,2020-02-04 22:20:57,eyv218,Agree. There‚Äôs a *huge* drug culture amongst teenagers and young adults - even if myself and my social circle didn‚Äôt touch anything throughout my high school and early uni years (underage drinking notwithstanding) other circles of kids were partying way harder.
280,2020-02-05 10:23:43,eyv218,The Netherlands checking in. I‚Äôm 21 and I agree. It‚Äôs usually limited to festivals though.
281,2020-02-05 02:53:56,eyv218,"Even when Justin was 14 and had done nothing yet, people were throwing homophobic slurs at him, pure hatred and wanted him harm and he had done nothing wrong at the time. Even being homophobic solely because he wore purple. 

I can‚Äôt believe I come out of the woodworks having to defend him on this sub all the time and I don‚Äôt like him. I get people hate him, but it‚Äôs strange how if it was anyone else besides him, or if he OD‚Äôd then there would be sympathy and people wanting the industry to change."
282,2020-02-05 06:23:08,eyv218,Oh till Justin dies you‚Äôll believe it. Okay
283,2020-02-05 05:38:33,eyv218,"He posted an Instagram story that was very mild and basically amounted to ""I love Scooter, I wish you two would get along"" and this was after Taylor put him on blast for abusing and bullying Selena, wasn't it? He could've started a genuine feud, instead he kinda ducked out. Hardly a huge strike on his list of sins, lol."
284,2020-02-04 21:03:19,eyv218,"yeah, i literally just noticed it's a pun. i'd never seen the term ""drag race"" being used in anything else before, so it got me really confused for a few seconds."
285,2020-02-04 21:18:19,eyv218,"Well I find it fascinating (in a sad way) that this pattern of young stars being steamrolled by their own fame really doesn‚Äôt have many exceptions. I don‚Äôt revel in his demise at all, unlike many of the people on this sub that are so quick to make him the punchline of every joke. I am sympathetic, but more fascinated."

290,2020-02-05 13:17:11,eyv218,Did you read my comment? I literally said I‚Äôm not justifying the hate he‚Äôs getting.
291,2020-02-05 11:35:51,eyv218,He also made fun of her for her surgery
292,2020-02-04 21:40:20,eyv218,"I‚Äôm saying, ‚Äúdid it wrong‚Äù as in, take advantage of a child, make him a product, instead of focusing and prioritizing on keeping him grounded and normal. Instead he got overworked, drugs easily available to him, and so on.

At least Billie is much more protected."
293,2020-02-04 21:36:32,eyv218,"If you really think about it, the industry does better of financially when pop stars like this die. Then they just wheel in the new/younger version and do it again with that younger generation."
294,2020-02-04 22:52:27,eyv218,"was it more authentic for demi, or were her struggles just more obvious to the public? i'm not particularly sympathetic towards justin, but even if he's a shitty person, the young kid that turned into both a huge star and an extremely unnecessarily hated teenager simultaneously never deserved to end up in a spiral like that. i don't doubt that him only talking about it pre-album release has tactical reasons behind it, but i don't think that necessarily diminishes the things he struggled with? in fact, if anything i'd say its just another symptom of the music industry prioritizing earnings over someone's physical and mental health. it's all he knows."

299,2020-03-28 16:32:16,fqm6d0,Yes but I may be biased because I‚Äôm Aqua sun Pisces moon and my fianc√© is Pisces sun Aqua rising. We are very similar and connect on a deeper level than I‚Äôve ever experienced with anyone else! We could talk all day and get lost in intriguing conversations :) he is very complex and prompts me to look at things differently than I normally would which keeps my mind entertained
300,2020-03-28 18:41:43,fqm6d0,"Aqua sun with Scorpio moon, mars,  and Rising with a Pisces Venus. I love them, the eyes are what gets me and just their genuine caring nature! They always seem very sweet and patient. One girl I was into over the summer was a Pisces and the dude I really want to date is one as well and they happen to have cancerian aspects.

I wonder why though, considering with how dETaCheD Aquarians are, like why that is lmao"
301,2020-03-28 20:59:08,fqm6d0,"My mom is a Pisces with some Aqua. I'm an aqua with some Pisces. Her and I are best friends when it comes to spirituality, sustainability, loving the earth, arts, expression, love of truth, philosophy, and humor.

When emotions come into play, I feel she imposes her feelings as reality. She feels like I'm not truly committed to our relationship. I don't feel I can be completely honest about her behaviors and their negative impact or she'll take it personal and catastrophize. She feels she can't be honest with me or I'll ghost her. 

Sometimes I get annoyed with Pisces (students of mine, lovers, friends, etc) because they're so emotional and live in this cagey, victim mentality based space. Say the wrong thing and they're ready to throw themselves off a building saying ""look at what you did."" 

They're fun to create with, though."
302,2020-03-28 21:22:15,fqm6d0,"Most of my closest friends, and my two BFF are Pisces."

304,2020-03-28 17:12:41,fqm6d0,Yes! I have had many rollercoaster relationships with Pisces! I'm currently engaged to one but my venus and mars are in Pisces so that's probably why. It's mainly romantic I'm rarely friends with Pisces
305,2020-03-28 17:47:58,fqm6d0,"I have my Venus in Pisces, I also have my Juno and Vesta in Pisces and Pisces rules my 5th house. I absolutely love Pisces (though not in a romantic way, I think we‚Äôre too incompatible in romance) and I‚Äôve known a lot and they are the most generous people I‚Äôve ever met. The way they care about those who are closest to them is absolutely admirable, and I appreciate all the Pisces friends I have in my life. I have an Aquarius stellium (sun, moon, mercury, uranus and neptune) so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not compatible with them in relationships, they‚Äôre a lot more affectionate and romantic than I‚Äôm comfortable with. But they make great friends and they‚Äôre in my top 5 favorite signs."

307,2020-03-28 19:57:09,fqm6d0,Not an Aquarian but fellow Saturn brethren here and I freaking adore Pisceans. They're so sensitive and dreamy. I just wanna be a rock for them. Winter signs gotta stick together.

I absolutely adore him! We have similar music tastes and we just get along great, alot of people say there will be problems in sex but I've yet to come across any!"
311,2020-03-29 03:23:37,fqm6d0,"I LOVE PISCESC SO MUCH!! Maybe because I‚Äôm very influenced by the pisces in my chart? 29 degree jupiter in pisces, venus in pisces....... but I do love them. they really fit the ‚Äúethereal‚Äù vibe in ~cliche~ astrology... <3"
312,2020-03-29 08:26:48,fqm6d0,"Pisces being the only sign later in the zodiac than aquarians definitely adds to our fascination... they can understand the really big conceptual ideas that our minds wander too and take it even one step further out there a lot of the time. Also, if you look into sidereal astrology, many pisces are aquarians in sidereal, and we all know how much aquas love other aquas ü§©"
313,2020-03-29 14:47:43,fqm6d0,"Yeah I love pisces a lot.  I have a lot of pisces in my chart and i‚Äôm a cusper, born on Feb 18. I mostly just feel like I understand them a lot, because I almost am one lol. I relate heavily to both Aquarius and Pisces traits."

315,2020-03-29 18:18:44,fqm6d0,"Love them as friends I have really good chill vibes w them for the most part, I‚Äôve been attracted to a few but it never has worked out amazingly for me, sometimes, SOMETIMES, it really was like dating a different person. I prefer to stay as friends, but that‚Äôs just the Aquarius in me always just tryna be friends before dating. 

My moms a Pisces and she‚Äôs the fucking worst"
316,2020-03-29 20:45:47,fqm6d0,"Honestly, on paper, Pisces and Libras were the first signs that sounded attractive to me.

MAYBE because that... For Pisces at least, my Venus and Mars sign is Capricorn"

318,2020-03-31 10:52:49,fqm6d0,I very much dislike scorpio.. I have a south node in Virgo which means they are attracted to me and tend to always want to be friends. I don‚Äôt like the dark energy of a Scorpio.
319,2020-03-28 18:35:17,fqm6d0,Amazing! How is it going? Especially the whole emotional side of it? :)
320,2020-03-29 09:27:55,fqm6d0,How's that working out for you? haha
321,2020-03-28 18:42:41,fqm6d0,Thanks for replying :)  I would honestly love to have some pisces in my chart lol. I find the same with any pisces I meet! Can literally talk about anything and its the most interesting conversation. Maybe that's why I like them so much because they are able to connect with me deeper than any other sign which is something I need. Wish you guys an amazing life filled with love <3
322,2020-03-28 18:48:53,fqm6d0,">Oh my god their eyes are mesmerising!! I love how much they care as well :') Sometimes I think maybe Im so attracted to them because I wish I could express my emotions as they do and not bottle them up all the time.....but it has to be more than that haha... and then sometimes I think maybe I just like the idea of them? and then I get scared that if I actually date a pisces that I won't be able to handle their emotional side.  Im not sure how I feel about cancers I only know a few including my twin sisters and they annoy me hahah but one of my best friends is a cancer too.

326,2020-03-28 18:39:47,fqm6d0,Thanks for the response :) They make amazing friends they're always there for advice and everything! See in my head I want a really affectionate/romantic relationship but I feel like my Aquarius placements always get in the way of expressing those feelings! What sign are you most attracted to with an Aquarius stellium?
327,2020-03-29 09:35:57,fqm6d0,Im gonna go check my chart to make sure I don't have any pisces. I don't have any pisces friends really! I did in the past but im mainly physically/ romantically attracted to them for some reason
328,2020-03-29 09:30:53,fqm6d0,so dreamy lol

I have liked some Gemini‚Äôs also but only if they have a fire moon. I don‚Äôt really like serious relationships and I like to keep things light hearted so I feel like that may be why I‚Äôm attracted to those signs. Sometimes my Pisces venus makes me think I want a serious romantic relationship, but I find that I‚Äôm more in love with the idea of love rather than love itself. So yeah it‚Äôs better to keep things lighthearted and I never really get into serious relationships."

Updated numbers are in the post (5K/130K)."
375,2020-03-27 20:54:58,fq5deb,"Great for The Weeknd. It's a truly great album that also gets to sell really well. 

Only thing I hate is that it doing so well means Dua Lipa likely doesn't go #1 next week and she deserves a #1 with Future Nostalgia"

377,2020-03-28 00:02:03,fq5deb,Amazing for Weeknd as expected but damn I know Bino had a shit rollout but that's still really fucking bad. Wow.
378,2020-03-27 21:10:50,fq5deb,"Pretty good for The Weeknd. Who are some other artists beside Drake, Cole, Kendrick, and Post who could sell more than 445k?"
379,2020-03-27 20:51:05,fq5deb,Imagine what Uzis numbers would‚Äôve been with good merch and physical copies available
380,2020-03-27 23:03:15,fq5deb,"Gambino made it even worse by streaming the album on his website the week before dropping it. By the time it dropped on streaming services, it wasn‚Äôt even that big of a surprise so there wasn‚Äôt that much conversation to be had on social media"
381,2020-03-27 22:02:07,fq5deb,"Haven't payed attention to Gambino in recent times, but aren't these fucking trash numbers for him?"
382,2020-03-27 22:04:20,fq5deb,Damn I really [underestimated](https://old.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/fm37y2/lil_uzi_verts_luv_vs_the_world_2_sells_247k_first/fl28i9c/) The Weeknd in 2020 lmao
383,2020-03-27 21:19:32,fq5deb,Is that bad for J Balvin? Doesn't sound good.
384,2020-03-27 21:42:06,fq5deb,holy fuck gambino fucking tanked
385,2020-03-27 21:22:48,fq5deb,"Weeknd sold more than BTS, now K-Pop stans are about to spend 3 months running an unpaid PR team and extending the amount of therapy they‚Äôll need as adults (if they aren‚Äôt already grown)

But, it‚Äôs a damn good album with a damn good rollout, expected nothing less. That Gambino was a load of pretentious crap from start to finish, wholeheartedly disappointed with it, don‚Äôt know Gambino was on with that one."
386,2020-03-27 21:36:03,fq5deb,Well deserved. Xotwod
387,2020-03-28 02:17:59,fq5deb,Just shows how much of a monster Drake is that he put up like 730k and people didn‚Äôt even flinch
388,2020-03-27 21:38:28,fq5deb,this must be a weird time for pure sales considering nobody wants to be around people
389,2020-03-28 02:19:17,fq5deb,How did J Balvin sell that low manz is huge in latin america
390,2020-03-28 05:37:28,fq5deb,I wish we had data for worldwide. Seeing the streaming numbers for just the US feels pointless given how globalised everything is.
391,2020-03-28 06:07:08,fq5deb,"Am I the only one impressed by The Weeknd's numbers? 445k without any features is absolutely nuts. If he would have decided to go a bit more commercial and add a Drake/Travis feature in there, the number would have been even higher but goddamn"
392,2020-03-27 22:55:10,fq5deb,"Important to mention that Weeknd had merch bundles (and a lot of them), like Nicki, Meek and Travis have."
393,2020-03-28 01:26:13,fq5deb,"y do the pure sales vary so much? how does the weeknd have 270 000 pure sales, and eternal atake, in second place, only have around 10k? and then eminem has over 100k and fourth place has 10k. is it because people like the weeknd and eminem go around buying physical copies to boost sales?"
394,2020-03-27 23:04:58,fq5deb,Thank god i'm not the only one who thought that Gambino album was fucking trash.
395,2020-03-28 02:32:06,fq5deb,Wow
396,2020-03-28 03:26:06,fq5deb,Ayyyy XOTWOD.
397,2020-03-28 08:28:10,fq5deb,"J Balvin is a rapper but Bad Bunny isn't? They're the same guy basically lol. That's how you know the rap charts should just be ""what young black people think is cool"""
398,2020-03-28 14:58:07,fq5deb,"I like Gambino but when you have a mid album, horrible rollout, no hype, no promotion it makes sense how bad he did on the charts. If this is his last album ever, what a huge letdown for his musical career and I am afraid it‚Äôll leave a mark on his legacy. I honestly think he doesn‚Äôt care about the music anymore and he just wants to write screenplays and act which is cool. But still it‚Äôs sad your last outing really went out like this."
399,2020-03-27 20:49:06,fq5deb,Predictions for PND?
400,2020-03-27 23:25:42,fq5deb,I definitely thought Weeknd was gonna sell 600K+ first week. Does anyone know how Starboy did first week?
401,2020-03-28 07:25:05,fq5deb,Can someone explain why does it say Luv Vs. The World 2 did 130k?
402,2020-03-28 12:39:23,fq5deb,wow was 3.15.20 really that bad?
403,2020-03-28 00:38:44,fq5deb,"Man I'm starting to think I'm the only one who liked Bino's album, it has some good shit on it"
404,2020-03-28 11:06:42,fq5deb,"BTS stans bitchin on Twitter about merch bundles when they buy like 10 each to inflate the numbers, they doin everything they can to discredit anyone who threatens their precious factory boys, and I say this as someone who enjoys a decent amount of k-pop songs"
405,2020-03-28 05:43:50,fq5deb,Isn't that kind of low for Beyonce and X?
406,2020-03-28 14:38:31,fq5deb,25k? What in the fuck?
407,2020-03-28 16:34:42,fq5deb,"weeknd still the king of pop, fuck kpop and bts"
408,2020-03-27 22:26:00,fq5deb,Highest since what?
409,2020-03-28 19:45:52,fq5deb,Glad to see Jhene's album has got legs....especially since it's not summer (her Aiko's music sounds the best IMO) so it might hold for awhile.
410,2020-03-28 06:58:02,fq5deb,Honestly shocked CG's album sold so few. Thought it'd get around 100-150K 1st week
411,2020-03-28 09:20:15,fq5deb,Album slaps. Well deserved.
412,2020-03-28 02:41:25,fq5deb,"Wow those pure sales... I can only imagine how high Uzis numbers would've been if he had merch lined up as well, he should've done a merch drop with digital album sales and he'd be so high up rn."
413,2020-03-28 05:55:29,fq5deb,"Eminem is still out here in the top 3 after 20 years into the game
Legend-wait-for-it-ary artist"
414,2020-03-28 10:57:48,fq5deb,BTS fans are hooking to the fact that The Weeknd had bundles and BTS didn't
415,2020-03-28 14:12:55,fq5deb,That‚Äôs awesome!
416,2020-03-28 03:48:00,fq5deb,Man what happened to J Balvin??? Isn‚Äôt he supposed to be huge?

425,2020-03-27 21:34:08,fq5deb,Can someone please explain the psychology behind Kpop stans it confuses me to no end
426,2020-03-27 22:32:12,fq5deb,the replies to the fan cams posts is honestly the funniest shit i‚Äôve seen
427,2020-03-27 22:18:04,fq5deb,"I genuinely can't stand K-Pop fandom, they're the most cancerous community out there. Half of them don't even care about the music."
428,2020-03-28 11:26:48,fq5deb,glad i turned off autoplay so they dont get any views off me
429,2020-03-27 22:39:14,fq5deb,those people are actually insane
430,2020-03-27 22:53:51,fq5deb,"They‚Äôre already ripping him for having over 80 merch bundles, including lollipops. They have a point tbh if ppl are comparing"
431,2020-03-28 04:42:16,fq5deb,they are a plague on modern society
432,2020-03-28 14:00:52,fq5deb,"Alright man K-Pop is pretty fire though. It‚Äôs not to my taste but I appreciate the crazy caliber of being able to sing, dance, and act with those high production videos. 

Some fans can be crazy just like with anything else"
433,2020-03-28 05:56:04,fq5deb,Who cares about ‚ÄúWeeknd conversation on twitter‚Äù fucking lol
434,2020-03-28 03:40:26,fq5deb,Not stupid videos.
435,2020-03-27 21:57:28,fq5deb,Didn't Gambino's album release a day late too? Plus his rollout was terrible
436,2020-03-27 23:22:11,fq5deb,"People comparing the popularity of Jay Electronica vs Childish Gambino? Seriously? Yes, Jay had a decade of hype behind him but that's from hip hop heads not the general public lol.
General audiences adore Gambino, I'm from Toronto and he managed to sell out the biggest stadium here. His popularity isnt even a question."
437,2020-03-27 21:36:30,fq5deb,"He had a decade of hype and Jay Z on the whole album, he better have outsold Binos no rollout album with half the songs having no name"
438,2020-03-28 11:23:49,fq5deb,Various Artists almost did
439,2020-03-27 22:09:52,fq5deb,people waited for a decade so yeah
440,2020-03-28 05:07:37,fq5deb,"*Jay Z outsold 

Fixed that for you"
441,2020-03-28 10:52:54,fq5deb,"From the cursory glance I've given the project I wouldn't buy a physical either. Whatever about the music but the artwork is blank, for me at least, and the names are placeholders. Whatever about the music but I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop regarding physical release."
442,2020-03-27 22:48:56,fq5deb,they always fuming
443,2020-03-27 22:57:37,fq5deb,Tbh if BTS did an assload of merch bundles like Weeknd did then Weeknd wouldn‚Äôt have beat them
444,2020-03-28 05:37:39,fq5deb,Twitter is a terrible place in general
445,2020-03-27 21:59:49,fq5deb,"He would have been fine had he released in 2018, right after This Is America dropped... or last year when he headlined Coachella. No clue why he waited so long lol"
446,2020-03-27 21:08:35,fq5deb,Or a better album.
447,2020-03-27 21:13:03,fq5deb,"I still think the weird, quiet rollout (if you even want to call it that) of this project was intentional because it's just an appetizer of sorts and not the final album we're getting. I'll be surprised if we don't get something more substantial this year."
448,2020-03-27 21:25:21,fq5deb,Seriously. I had friends that love BTI and all his projects that didn't even know this came out.
449,2020-03-27 21:56:45,fq5deb,[deleted]
450,2020-03-28 12:03:25,fq5deb,"Normal rollout, normal song titles, and no dropping on a Sunday it would probably do at least 50k. But then, he probably wasn't going for sales."
451,2020-03-28 12:55:38,fq5deb,Rumour is that he wanted to drop this album as Donald Glover (explaining why it‚Äôs put up everywhere as Donald Glover Presents and not Childish Gambino Presents) but the label fucked him over and made him release it as Childish Gambino so I still think there‚Äôs something coming but I don‚Äôt wanna get hyped up for nothing
452,2020-03-28 15:34:50,fq5deb,"Tbh, this was the least enjoyable Childish album for me in his entire discography that I've listened to. For me that includes everything onwards from culdesac. I get that he's going for big ideas, but the album isn't pleasing to listen to."
453,2020-03-27 22:57:23,fq5deb,"Week 16 and he outsold Gambino by 10,000 sheesh"
454,2020-03-28 02:35:50,fq5deb,"It's insane how successful the album has been. It's a really great project, but I never would have expected it to sell anywhere near what it has."
455,2020-03-27 22:59:18,fq5deb,"Selling just about 40k on week 16, even with huge names like The Weeknd dropping, is crazy"
456,2020-03-28 01:35:28,fq5deb,That consistency is insane holy shit
457,2020-03-28 02:51:31,fq5deb,Never imagined he would make it this far the first time i even heard the album. I still remember my friend calling me weird for listening to the box. Well whos reall the weird one now huh
458,2020-03-28 06:50:52,fq5deb,Reminds me of when Goodbye & Good Riddance multiplied in sales when Lucid Dreams blew up.
459,2020-03-28 17:31:33,fq5deb,"2 or 3 weeks until the tape goes Platinum, insane considering where he was just a year ago"
460,2020-03-27 21:41:22,fq5deb,Good bot
461,2020-03-28 12:19:19,fq5deb,Wow! Thanks for your great effort!
462,2020-03-28 00:01:23,fq5deb,Damn. A lot less than I would've expected.

But yeah loved After Hours, well deserved. What‚Äôs Dua Lipa‚Äôs album like?"
465,2020-03-28 00:34:10,fq5deb,Honestly don‚Äôt think dua would debut at number one most weeks. The albums great but most people only regard her as a singles artist as of now. I don‚Äôt see it doing great numbers
466,2020-03-28 11:54:52,fq5deb,"I just had a listen to Future Nostalgia and I was really surprised by the quality. It's a really good album, and considering I'm not a huge pop fan that's saying something."
467,2020-03-27 22:03:29,fq5deb,Do u know how much funeral has sold so far
468,2020-03-27 21:52:28,fq5deb,is post about to outsell em a year after he dropped ?
469,2020-03-27 23:42:48,fq5deb,what's megs fever doing rn?
470,2020-03-28 07:11:02,fq5deb,"I'm interested in this race for the first album to go plat

Will probably be After Hours but it will be close"
471,2020-03-27 22:52:41,fq5deb,It's weird as fuck that Eminem might not even get a platinum album outta this
472,2020-03-27 21:17:14,fq5deb,Probably Travis
473,2020-03-27 21:17:03,fq5deb,Adele
474,2020-03-27 21:18:28,fq5deb,"Like a bunch of pop artists. Ariana Grande, Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish."
475,2020-03-27 22:36:29,fq5deb,"Eminem sold about that amount with Kamikaze iirc, didn't do as well with the new one though"
476,2020-03-28 01:18:40,fq5deb,If Em cared to do a proper rollout then he would be somewhere there. MMLP2 (even tho that was 7 years ago) did like almost 800K first week
477,2020-03-27 21:32:33,fq5deb,"Travis, Bruno Mars,"
478,2020-03-28 08:33:34,fq5deb,a lotta artists can do that with merch and ticket bundles. considering even halsey did 230k with ticket bundles
479,2020-03-27 22:55:57,fq5deb,"If everyone did merch bundles like Weeknd did, the question becomes more interesting"
480,2020-03-28 03:36:49,fq5deb,"Do you think Kanye could be up there? I think with a proper album rollout and great album, he could possibly."
481,2020-03-28 01:33:00,fq5deb,Uzi
482,2020-03-27 21:34:56,fq5deb,Wayne
483,2020-03-27 21:01:49,fq5deb,"Tbh just more merch in general. I believe for the first week uzi only had one shirt on the website. And I don't think he made one post about merch on Twitter or instagram. He only promoted the music itself. 

Which imo is dope and refreshing compared to other artist that promote the merch almost as much as the music just to inflate numbers. 

Uzi almost selling 300k and doing 400 million streams in the first week without a bunch of clothes/merch is crazy"
484,2020-03-27 21:07:56,fq5deb,"Absolutely insane numbers. He would‚Äôve rivaled Astroworld in numbers if he had good merch. Taking away bundles, After Hours did 173k from streaming compared to 300k for Uzi."
485,2020-03-27 22:46:52,fq5deb,"Uzi doesn't have a merch fanbase. Travis, Kanye, Tyler have built a fanbase that actually likes their clothing"
486,2020-03-27 21:09:28,fq5deb,"I was expecting him to have merch bundles when the deluxe dropped and thought the reason he didn't at first was because he dropped a week early, but nope"
487,2020-03-28 04:41:56,fq5deb,There is merch up for preorder right now with album bundles. His numbers aren‚Äôt done yet
488,2020-03-27 22:30:23,fq5deb,"These numbers are absolutely abysmal imo. Yeah, the rollout was awful, the song titles are nondescript, and there‚Äôs no cover, but he has a huge core fanbase and probably could‚Äôve garner a bunch of streams from people just checking out the project. 

I expected at the very least double what he actually sold - Because the Internet and Awaken My Love did around 100k, and even camp sold 52k. For this to not even do half of what Camp did is honestly embarrassing.  

He took none of the hype that This Is America built, a NUMBER ONE DEBUTING SINGLE, and despite just headlining Coachella last year, he couldn‚Äôt sell more than 25k. Honestly may be the biggest commercial disappointment I‚Äôve seen in a long, long time. I get that it‚Äôs an eccentric album with a weird release but these numbers are straight horrible. It‚Äôs almost like he didn‚Äôt care if anyone listened to it at all."
489,2020-03-27 22:19:22,fq5deb,"released on a Sunday, it was kind of a surprise drop, and the music is bad. not really that surprising

he‚Äôs never sold THAT much, but if he would‚Äôve dropped an album in like September or October 2018, it probably would‚Äôve done like 150-200k"
490,2020-03-27 22:20:32,fq5deb,Biggest r n b artist of the decade n still is
491,2020-03-27 22:22:58,fq5deb,"I don't think it's bad for latin artists. For example, Bad Bunny's album was the highest charting all-Spanish album EVER at like ~106K(?), also, his (J Balvin's) last solo album sold 22K.

edit: clarification"
492,2020-03-27 22:26:36,fq5deb,these are only his sales in the US
493,2020-03-28 00:25:36,fq5deb,I doubt he cares much about US numbers
494,2020-03-28 00:39:06,fq5deb,These are just US numbers. Artists like J Balvin and Bad Bunny are bigger in Latin America
495,2020-03-28 02:45:18,fq5deb,"these are American numbers, he probably murdered it in other markwts"
496,2020-03-28 06:25:48,fq5deb,"it isnt good, people were wondering if he could pull off the first all Spanish #1 album and now he didnt even outsell Bad Bunny's 4 week old album"
497,2020-03-28 07:16:07,fq5deb,These are US numbers
498,2020-03-28 05:41:19,fq5deb,"Have you listened to the album? It‚Äôs kinda weird. I don‚Äôt dislike it, but it‚Äôs also kind of hard to remember which songs you liked when they‚Äôre all just fuckin time stamps."
499,2020-03-28 06:39:10,fq5deb,Last song goes hard tho
500,2020-03-28 07:39:47,fq5deb,"There's a theory that he released the album the way he did as a way to satisfy his contract with Adidas, the same way Frank Ocean did with Endless. 

Couple that with the album art he initally streamed with, and then the message he left. Everything about the rollout of the album is traditionally wrong for Gambino, so until his next album comes out (if that even happens) it seems like a PLAUSIBLE theory.

I'm a big fan, but this album was extremely awkward and ""Feels Like Summer,"" a 2 year old song, being on here but not ""This Is America,"" ""Saturday"" or ""Atavista"" is eyebrow raising."
501,2020-03-28 14:23:38,fq5deb,"We going to pretend BTS didn't have different versions of the same album with collectors photocards - not to mention buying physical album copies is massive in KPOP since they love their numbers. Hence, the reason for their high physical numbers but low streaming. Complaining is just rather ironic."
502,2020-03-27 22:57:06,fq5deb,"They‚Äôre already at him bc ppl are comparing but Weeknd used an assload of merch bundles (over 80 items) and including things like lollipops. So they have a point if ppl are comparing

Edit: What I say? Ppl laughing at stans just to turn around and like stans too?"
503,2020-03-27 23:07:53,fq5deb,Digital sales count as pure sales too.
504,2020-03-28 05:47:23,fq5deb,bc these are US charts
505,2020-03-28 00:52:47,fq5deb,Also gotta take into consideration the new rules for 2020 where you have to offer with and without an album and I know there must have been a bunch of merch orders without the $3.50 extra digital download
506,2020-03-28 07:17:05,fq5deb,Yeah uzi did far better in streaming
507,2020-03-28 01:52:10,fq5deb,"In Uzi‚Äôs case, he has a young fanbase who don‚Äôt buy music at all and he also didn‚Äôt have any bundles. Eminem‚Äôs fanbase is older so they will buy his music. The Weeknd on the otherhand just had hella merch bundles which inflated his pure sales. Probably wouldn‚Äôt have done more than 80-100k without them"
508,2020-03-28 13:54:52,fq5deb,Weeknd gave out copies of the CD with ticket purchases for the After Hours tour.
509,2020-03-28 01:45:50,fq5deb,I honestly don't get what you're asking. Some artists just have fans who buy albums and some have fans who only stream. Not that hard to understand.
510,2020-03-28 11:54:04,fq5deb,I can't answer about other fanbases but a lot of Eminem fans have collections of his cds. That's why he always has a lot of pure sales.
511,2020-04-06 06:22:34,fq5deb,After Hours as a whole album is more complete than any of the other ones here. So some people buy it entirely whereas listen to certain tracks of others through streams. Em has fans of all ages and that's why his pure sales are still pretty high.
512,2020-03-28 15:13:53,fq5deb,"[You're not the only one, but that's not exactly the consensus.](https://www.metacritic.com/music/31520/childish-gambino) I personally loved it, save for 1 or 2 songs."
513,2020-03-28 03:21:57,fq5deb,It was fucking terrible especially that algorhythem song with the demon gangbang at the end of it
514,2020-03-28 16:02:07,fq5deb,"i mean, both are up there? but both rap and sing, i would just say that BB sings more than he raps, and J Balvin raps more than he sings"
515,2020-03-27 20:50:59,fq5deb,"I'd like to see PND succeed but unfortunately I don't see this doing more than PND3. I'm gonna say 50k or less, probably closer to 40k"
516,2020-03-27 22:53:40,fq5deb,50k from the Rihanna hype
517,2020-03-27 20:59:06,fq5deb,37k
518,2020-03-27 21:24:08,fq5deb,[deleted]
519,2020-03-27 21:42:01,fq5deb,I‚Äôd be surprised to see more than 35k
520,2020-03-27 23:47:45,fq5deb,Gonna be the lone person guessing high here and I'll say he pulls a Jhene and pushes 100K
521,2020-03-27 22:25:28,fq5deb,2 copies
522,2020-03-27 23:26:04,fq5deb,318k
523,2020-03-27 23:58:57,fq5deb,Streaming overall is down because of corona virus. I think he could have done 500k+.
524,2020-03-28 15:22:54,fq5deb,That‚Äôs just counting the 14 new songs
525,2020-03-28 07:22:33,fq5deb,"I thought Algorhythm was p sick and of course Feels Like Summer, but I honestly couldn't tell you how the rest of the album sounds."
526,2020-03-28 06:03:52,fq5deb,"Honestly I thought it was pretty good, but it‚Äôs def not for everybody. I‚Äôm also puzzled as to why he leaked the album then released it a whole week later. And that‚Äôs after releasing one of its singles nearly 2 years ago.

I hope this doesn‚Äôt put bad vibes on the new season of Atlanta."
527,2020-03-27 22:39:43,fq5deb,Hollywood's Bleeding I believe. That one made about 40k units more first week.
528,2020-03-27 22:34:32,fq5deb,Probably Post Malone last year

531,2020-03-27 22:39:32,fq5deb,anyone could have predicted over 300k
532,2020-03-28 15:23:25,fq5deb,These are just US #s
533,2020-03-28 00:08:13,fq5deb,Go look for sales world wide lol...
534,2020-03-28 00:36:24,fq5deb,Embarrassing post. You do realize this is US only?
535,2020-03-28 01:58:41,fq5deb,Us charts only and the bunny is still top 5
536,2020-03-28 02:47:08,fq5deb,there‚Äôs nothing more fascinating to me than when people like you talk so confidently about something they know absolutely nothing about

Try and block them completely out of your mind if you care about your rationalization skills and intelligence."
542,2020-03-28 00:50:01,fq5deb,Losers who forced their way out of the lockers they were RIGHTFULLY shoved into.
543,2020-03-28 04:23:35,fq5deb,its the same as any other teen fanbase. the only difference is the kpop industry feeds them nonstop content. and they go way harder lmao

546,2020-03-28 13:11:24,fq5deb,"To me it's a product of Twitter culture, they seem to relish gaming twitter mechanics and taking things that other people find insignificant (like view counts on video) as trophies"
547,2020-03-27 21:53:29,fq5deb,"Why do you like rap? People are different and like different things, hope I didn't blow your mind too much."
548,2020-03-28 02:28:06,fq5deb,"It's so weird to think that there are thousands of people out there who do nothing but sit on twitter for most of the day posting video compilations of people who have no idea that they exist. It's not even limited to just Kpop, it's pop music in general. There's nothing wrong with loving or looking up to an artist, but basing your whole life/identity around them is pretty fucking creepy."

552,2020-03-28 01:26:35,fq5deb,I thought that wasn't allowed anymore?
553,2020-03-27 23:32:42,fq5deb,"Yeah people keep calling this a surprise drop but he took all the surprise out when he leaked his own album lol

If he didn‚Äôt do the stream on his website and just randomly uploaded it to streaming it would have done a lot better. Given how you either love or hate this album the only people who are going to listen to it a week later are people who really love it"
554,2020-03-28 01:52:29,fq5deb,I didn't even know he had a new album out. Someone really fucked up this marketing.
555,2020-03-28 02:48:15,fq5deb,why would you leak stream your album and then not release it until several days later? That is asking for people to listen to your album and forget about it
556,2020-03-28 09:30:47,fq5deb,"He just sold 25k, his popularity is definitely in question lol."
557,2020-03-28 03:44:53,fq5deb,Where the sales at then
558,2020-03-27 22:11:06,fq5deb,Yeah but Donald Glover is a household name and Jay Elec is nowhere near that. If the rollout was that scuffed that‚Äôs a massive marketing mistake but someone with as many billboard hits as Glover should not be scratching 25k first week.
559,2020-03-27 22:24:08,fq5deb,"Lmao you act like gambino isn‚Äôt a household name with everyone from art hoes to ‚Äòwoke‚Äô people to nerds to fans of atlanta and community and the people that don‚Äôt like rap except for the ‚Äòsmart‚Äô rap shit. 

Then realize that jay electronica had a decade of hype sure and had jayz on almost every album. But jayz wasn‚Äôt named on any tracks and his duet album with Beyonc√© didn‚Äôt even go number 1. 

And act like this isn‚Äôt a huge fall off for gambino."
560,2020-03-27 23:01:48,fq5deb,"This literally doesn‚Äôt matter, Gambino is one of the biggest stars in Hip-Hop and in entertainment PERIOD. Those numbers are shockingly low"
561,2020-03-27 23:51:39,fq5deb,lol imagine a fan of k pop and fuming on twitter. life really went stupid huh.
562,2020-03-27 23:04:52,fq5deb,what's stopping them then ? they're already buying like 20 albums for eachother to inflate the numbers

564,2020-03-28 11:43:15,fq5deb,"To be fair, The Weeknd brought in some major heavy hitters from the streetwear community so. Readymade, Bape, AWGE, and Vlone all he was missing was some Off White and it would‚Äôve probably been the best merch in a long time for hypebeasts."
565,2020-03-28 08:30:36,fq5deb,it was the ticket bundles that did it for weeknd. not the merch bundles
566,2020-03-27 23:53:24,fq5deb,Is This Is America on the album?  Either way the guy had plenty of time to work on this album.
567,2020-03-28 01:41:19,fq5deb,"I‚Äôm gonna guess

He did not care"
568,2020-03-28 02:28:17,fq5deb,Maybe because the album probably didn't exist then? Not giving any of the tracks titles and randomly streaming on the Sunday before release are pretty valid criticisms but you're losing sight of the creative process if you seriously think he cares mostly about sales to force himself to make an album 2 years before it naturally came to him.
569,2020-03-27 21:09:19,fq5deb,Eh normally quality doesn't change album sales that much
570,2020-03-28 00:53:50,fq5deb,I‚Äôm genuinely shocked with the reactions to this album. It‚Äôs so fucking amazing to me and it just baffles me to see a comment shitting on it get so many upvotes. It feels like I‚Äôm listening to a totally different album
571,2020-03-28 04:41:06,fq5deb,Glad someone said it
572,2020-03-28 14:45:49,fq5deb,I loved the album. His best album to date imo.
573,2020-03-27 21:15:18,fq5deb,"Hope that's right, impossible to tell with Donald though."
574,2020-03-28 04:37:08,fq5deb,"I think Donald is just well into the ""I do whatever the fuck I want and I kinda hate everyone in the industry"" phase of his career. That interview from a couple of years ago he sounded really alienated and over it."
575,2020-03-27 22:02:39,fq5deb,It's not just a surprise drop. He dropped the album a week earlier and then actually released it on a Sunday morning. That's not a normal rollout and changes how well it sells. You can't argue it didn't since he literally missed two days that count for sales.
576,2020-03-28 02:46:22,fq5deb,"I see a lot of people talk about the 21 Savage track, Algorhythm, and Time."
577,2020-03-28 00:58:17,fq5deb,Is uzi still under generation now
578,2020-03-27 22:27:06,fq5deb,Who TF is listening to Dua Lipa leaks
579,2020-03-27 21:20:30,fq5deb,"Upbeat 80s pop with a modern touch is probably the best description. Dua writes all of her songs and the production is really great so it's a very enjoyable listen, at least, if you like pop sounding music. But I find her up there with Lana as making pop music that's just its own special thing"
580,2020-03-28 09:45:06,fq5deb,Hope it does better than Camilla's album.
581,2020-03-27 22:08:54,fq5deb,279K SPS
582,2020-03-27 22:01:18,fq5deb,"Not that surprising, Post is huge and his album came out in september, not a year ago"
583,2020-03-27 23:41:34,fq5deb,"He will get Platinum by the end of the year, he is missing 330K only. 

But what seems to surprise me here on this subreddit is people underestimate career length A LOT. 

Kanye West's last 2 solo albums and the KSG album haven't went Platinum. And Kanye started his career way later than Eminem. 8 years later (or 5 years if we go by first album from major label).

Kanye West is the third bestselling hip-hop artist of all time, that is why i am comparing Em to him.

I know Em was way bigger in his prime so people are used to big numbers from him, so if the previous comparison wasn't good enough compare him to someone like Mariah Carey, who was Artist of the Decade 90s (Em was 00s), who just like Eminem has 200M+ records sold worldwide, Diamond albums etc. 

She started her career in 1990, Eminem in 1996 (or 1999\*). So see what numbers she did when she was 24 years in her career. Luckily  ""*Me. I Am Mariah... The Elusive Chanteuse""* came out in 2014 or you can go with  "" *Merry Christmas II You""* which was released 2010."
584,2020-03-27 22:55:39,fq5deb,"Astroworld sold 550k, if he dropped an album it would for sure do at least 500k"
585,2020-03-27 22:07:29,fq5deb,Thank U Next didn't even break 350k and was promoted hard ASF
586,2020-03-27 22:50:25,fq5deb,Not Ariana Grande at all. Her last two albums did 231k and 360k respectively.
587,2020-03-27 21:18:48,fq5deb,Actually kinda just those three
588,2020-03-28 14:50:15,fq5deb,"So there‚Äôs this weird thing that happens with pop artist where their first week sales aren‚Äôt really that strong. But subsequent weeks they maintain or even increase sales. This is due to a song off the album exploding in popularity later on leading to more people buying the album or streaming it. 


Plus this whole ‚Äúfirst week‚Äù dick measuring contest was started by 50 who is a hip hop artist so I get why labels are letting Pop, rock with their numbers."
589,2020-03-28 00:35:06,fq5deb,Yeah. No rollout surprise drop and still can hit those numbers. I really like Kamikaze but MTBMB is amazing IMO. I don‚Äôt understand the lack of sales on it.
590,2020-03-28 14:20:23,fq5deb,"I still think he could have crossed 500k if he promoted it the way he did with Kamikaze. Now that Paul left Def Jam, he could do a much better job promoting Em's albums."
591,2020-03-28 14:25:47,fq5deb,He's stopped rolling out big. Now he lets his albums marinate in time
592,2020-03-28 10:50:28,fq5deb,I don't think he'll do a big roll out again. He tops the charts with no effort put into roll out while the alternative is he risks a shit campaign like Revivals rollout or he invests a lot of time and effort like MMLP. Man is going to be number one anyway and he doesn't seem to care for numbers all that much... Though I have to assume numbers are why he features Ed Sheeran.
593,2020-03-28 13:28:09,fq5deb,lmao u cant compare numbers from 7 years ago to now. the music landscape has just changed way too much
594,2020-03-28 01:50:00,fq5deb,Bruno maybe not. 24k Magic only did 231k first week.
595,2020-03-28 07:35:45,fq5deb,I'm a Kanye stan and these days he'd have to change a lot to even think about those numbers. And the album would need to be some MBDTF level shit to hit numbers like that. Very unlikely nowadays
596,2020-03-28 18:48:23,fq5deb,"He didn‚Äôt tho

Love your name btw lmao"
597,2020-03-27 21:36:17,fq5deb,nah
598,2020-03-28 14:57:13,fq5deb,He released essentially two albums. That surely have contributed to his streaming numbers.
599,2020-03-27 21:09:28,fq5deb,He had 30k more in streaming than ASTROWORLD IIRC. Travis went absolutely insane with bundles for that album
600,2020-03-28 01:06:55,fq5deb,"Am I missing something? The weeknd T-shirt‚Äôs don‚Äôt come with a free album. It‚Äôs just a T-shirt.

Edit: ah there are a bunch that include the album on the USA store. Here in the uk it‚Äôs just a T-shirt no digital album included."
601,2020-03-28 01:50:29,fq5deb,Nothing against the Weeknd I think he‚Äôs a good artist but this bundle thing is ridiculous TBH it‚Äôs smart from him and Travis but it does seem unfair to compare numbers when it‚Äôs not indicative of how many people are actually listening to the albums
602,2020-03-28 14:54:12,fq5deb,Well Uzi released double the amount of songs
603,2020-03-28 04:43:07,fq5deb,I actually love the EA merch. Ordered [this sweater](https://store.liluziofficial.com/luv-eternal-atake-white-crewneck-digital-album.html)
604,2020-03-27 23:55:28,fq5deb,"What about chrome heart tags?  I mean im not quite sure what he makes but its being referenced left and right and if there was a time to capitalize on it, it would be now."
605,2020-03-27 22:48:12,fq5deb,"he doesn't have merch game like travis, kanye or tyler. People won't just buy merch off you if you haven't cultivated it in your fanbase."
606,2020-03-28 00:25:40,fq5deb,"I honestly think that might be it. Some of the mixes doesn't even sound finished, and I feel like he really cares more about his career as an actor at this point. He just needed to put something out and dip out of music"
607,2020-03-28 04:41:09,fq5deb,"I'm a big Gambino fan and have been for ages and I only found out he had a new album because I misclicked a video on YouTube and it was one of the songs that was a bunch of numbers. That was yesterday.

I'm also not sure Donald actually cares. He seems well into the ""I'm going to do whatever i want"" phase of his career"
608,2020-03-28 00:07:58,fq5deb,Yeah people mostly talking about the Weeknd in this thread so how insanely bad this is for Donald is getting overshadowed. It's pathetic.
609,2020-03-27 22:50:06,fq5deb,"A surprise drop for an artist like Gambino still should not have that low of sales. Uzi and Eminem had somewhat surprise drops and did great numbers, two artists with loyal fanbases something I assume Gambino does not lack. That's what confuses me."
610,2020-03-28 00:00:41,fq5deb,just getting bigger. New album was amazing but imagine if he ever went back to old Weeknd for an album. DUdes cult following would be tripping over themselves.
611,2020-03-28 06:46:09,fq5deb,[deleted]
612,2020-03-27 22:28:56,fq5deb,"I imagined J Balvin as bigger than Bad Bunny, guess my meter is way off w/ that scene"
613,2020-03-27 22:59:05,fq5deb,I guess Bad Bunny is bigger in the US as well
614,2020-03-28 15:09:36,fq5deb,Bad Bunny's album sold over 180k first week then over 110k second week.
615,2020-03-27 22:49:27,fq5deb,"in 2020 standards, yeah, it was the highest charting. but in the 2000s latin music sold a lot more copies, but you probably know this because it affects every type of music..."
616,2020-03-28 06:22:31,fq5deb,"this is so true, i was talking to my friend and i was like ""yeah i liked that song where he said ""the violence"" a bunch and also the last 2 songs"" and it turns out the violence song is just...one of the last 2 songs lmao"
617,2020-03-28 14:29:15,fq5deb,"I actually quite enjoyed the album tbf, but like you said... The time stamp track list is just annoying"
618,2020-03-28 14:47:24,fq5deb,"I loved it. Conceptually, it's different. But the music is wonderful for me."
619,2020-03-28 06:30:20,fq5deb,"I like the album a lot. There's official titles online, I just renamed the songs on my apple music to match what I want."
620,2020-03-28 23:07:19,fq5deb,His delivery is obnoxious
621,2020-03-28 13:41:13,fq5deb,"That reminds me, did we ever get a full version of Saturday that isnt from the SNL performance?"
622,2020-03-27 23:59:49,fq5deb,I'm sorry but there's a place you can buy the weeknd album and get a lollipop?!
623,2020-03-28 13:17:21,fq5deb,"Bc BTS gamed their sales as much but didn't do it as well lmao, it's Nicki trying to shit on Travis all over again."
624,2020-03-28 13:37:09,fq5deb,BTS sold different copies of the same album that just come with different photos and shit. they have no point
625,2020-03-28 19:16:44,fq5deb,how did Bad Bunny get so many sales in comparison? is that global or US sales?
626,2020-03-28 01:27:10,fq5deb,Odd I can‚Äôt find the with or without option digital album on his store
627,2020-03-28 15:04:40,fq5deb,He released two albums
628,2020-03-28 01:57:05,fq5deb,"yeah i figured eminem had an older fan base, I didn't know about the  weeknd's merch deals. that actually clears it up a lot"
629,2020-03-28 05:06:34,fq5deb,"That realization that even relatively small 50k sales would **double** Gambino's numbers, holy shit. Can't believe how hard the project flopped."
630,2020-03-27 23:07:16,fq5deb,Loyal‚Äôs been out for a while and hasn‚Äôt really taken off so I don‚Äôt think that Drake feature is helping.
631,2020-03-28 16:18:28,fq5deb,No way dude eventhough i liked a couple of songs i dont think 100k is possible
632,2020-03-27 23:26:41,fq5deb,Wow I really thought he was bigger than this

Ok, if you're one of those people making the videos all the time you might be a bit strange, but I don't see it as any different from subscribing to a subreddit really.  It's not about the celebrity acknowledging you it's just engaging with the rest of the fanbase. 

When I was in middle school some girls got super into Twilight and would talk about the books and movies non-stop and only wear their Team Jacob shirts and were just consumed by it. I'm guessing all these super stans on twitter right now are just like them, literal Middle Schoolers who haven't diversified their interests yet."

665,2020-03-28 07:08:19,fq5deb,don't forget they even have groups of people that pitch in money to buy large quantities of albums for fans who can't buy them for whatever reason
666,2020-03-28 11:00:37,fq5deb,"My sister (15yo) is obsessed with BTS. For the last couple of years all the birthday cards she‚Äôs given to my parents have been written in Korean with English subtitles. All her money goes on buying the different albums with all the varied photos etc as they are ‚Äòcollectible‚Äô and she even buys the vinyls even though she doesn‚Äôt have (or want) a record player. For Christmas my parents bought her the exact same outfit one of the members wore on tour once and she wore it for a week. BTS fans are crazy. 

My friend wants to see them and is dragging me so I‚Äôm bringing my sister (if we can get tickets) but honestly it might be funnier if we can‚Äôt get tickets for her but I still go, FaceTime her but Hangup just as they come on stage"
667,2020-03-28 17:29:52,fq5deb,"Now as a music fan I would like you to please stop devaluing how much of a shitty practice actual bundles are. Bundles are a method created by labels to get more money from the artist's earning while the artist will get a higher chart position & only artists who are financially secure can afford to do it, the existence of the practice of bundling hurts artists who aren't as rich as they can't afford labels taking more money from them in exchange of chart position.... you just can't compare this malpractice that labels exploit to force artists into giving them more money and people to buy an album everytime you buy anything but an album for better chart position to having  just 4 versions that people are free to buy or not buy which in this particular case of only BTS exists because of their extremely concept heavy albums with concepts that they explore in the music and contributes to the meaning of the album as a whole, noone puts that much effort into creating an album nowadays, and it's very unlike other current American artists like the weeknd, Jonas brothers, Taylor swift(who also has multiple versions but the difference being just the color of the photo...that's how irrelevant the versions are...just meaningless collectibles), and other Korean artists who're signed to an American label  doing BUNDLES (an actual malpractice by labels that hurt other artists who DON'T do bundles). Those who choose not to bundles even when they CAN care for not only for their own music but other artists as well."
668,2020-03-28 05:34:53,fq5deb,"> Each fan essentially bought the album 4 times when collecting these sets.

Overstating on the each part. Also, we‚Äôre these photo shoots from physical or digital albums bc there‚Äôs a large difference there?"
669,2020-03-28 16:38:30,fq5deb,"This argument about BTS having 4 album versions being anywhere comparable to bundling is just so purposefully ignorant.

The album costs 27$, but for many it costs much more bc of shipping or depending on where you go buy it, the price can be much higher.

People MAY buy more than one version bc they treat the albums as collectible, BUT most folks can't afford spending that much, let alone all of it in the first week. I assure you that 4 versions available for most people means ""which one do I like best?"" and they buy the one and that's it. 

Even IF one could afford all 4 versions in the first week, it would be still 4 ALBUMS aka music that costs a pretty nice sum that you're buying. You ARE NOT buying a freaking lollipop and getting a free album thrown at you and calling it ""album sale""

so y'all need to stop being purposefully oblivious

BTS ain't selling out stadiums on your fave's turf just for you to act like their numbers are just bc of a limited number of obsessed ppl buying many versions of an album.

BTS' numbers are consistent on all planes you go and research, from sales to streams to tours to social media engagement etc

If they were to do bundles, even just Tour bundles, the US industry would collapse in a scramble to avoid being embarrassed by the numbers that that would churn out. Imagine if they pulled the type of bundles that Abel, and some other acts, did lmao"
670,2020-03-28 15:29:33,fq5deb,"How is that even comparable? Also BTS has been doing that forever even when their sales were so low. Ppl buy them because they want to not the same as bundles. Wow photosets are bundled with albums? That's a kpop thing, it has always been that way. Not something made by BTS.

And if BTS really wanted to run the industry to the ground they would do merch bundles or tour bundles but they won't. Nor would they pay radio to play them. 

Downvote me to hell for all i care."
671,2020-03-28 01:28:30,fq5deb,Where did it say that? His website is full of merch that comes with + digital album but I doubt he‚Äôs just giving copies away with merch for free w/o bundling
672,2020-03-28 01:02:16,fq5deb,"From what I‚Äôve seen, most people didn‚Äôt even know Bino dropped an album this time around - huge difference from when he dropped AML and this album was also highly experimental and didn‚Äôt even have any actual track names lmao"
673,2020-03-28 02:40:38,fq5deb,"There was no marketing. Just a surprise stream on the 15th then a two day countdown prior to the official released the following week. He/his team rarely post anything but management tweets and IG posts is all there was.

I get what they were going for but it makes sense that the numbers aren't high."
674,2020-03-28 09:43:44,fq5deb,It's not though. Donald Glover the person is extremely popular. He'll sell out every show he does if he tours. That's where artists make money.
675,2020-03-29 03:31:23,fq5deb,"I think it can be attributed to having a terrible album rollout and honestly, just not being very good. Once it came out on his website I had a few friends who listened on there, didn't like it, and didn't see any reason to listen again on Spotify. Donald Glover's popularity seems undeniably huge, though. I'm not even a fan of him in Lion King, Solo, The Martian or basically anything but Atlanta lately but the public seems to love him and Awaken My Love was recieved really well and was even nominated for a Grammy. It's definitely a little surprising to see him underperform so spectacularly."

677,2020-03-27 22:14:15,fq5deb,I‚Äôm not sure if Donald Glover is a household name yet
678,2020-03-28 05:35:50,fq5deb,"Even 10 years ago, when he had a good amount of hype around him, Jay Electronica was nowhere near the level of fame of Glover."

It happened over the past two weeks. how do u not remember this?"
680,2020-03-28 01:28:29,fq5deb,and jay electronica makes significantly better music.
681,2020-03-28 01:29:07,fq5deb,‚Äúdecade of hype‚Äù more like a decade ago he had a little popularity and his buzz has had a decade of atrophy
682,2020-03-28 01:36:43,fq5deb,"He did like basically everything possible for this not to sell well. Feels Like Summer is technically the single for this and it didn't even get named. He had other songs he premiered that could have been singles but didn't like Saturday. The album doesn't really sound like AML, doesn't sound like BTI, had a weird roll out, don't think there's merch either. 

Even as someone who likes the album I figured it'd flop. The lukewarm reception probably didn't help though that doesn't always mean good or bad sales. If this came out around the TIA hype it would have done better I'd guess"
683,2020-03-28 07:13:41,fq5deb,Your reasoning for household name is killing me. All of those people fall into a narrow band.
684,2020-03-28 05:26:27,fq5deb,"Except he‚Äôs not...lol. Fanboys online love to exaggerate how popular he is. Redbone & This Is America are the only popular things he‚Äôs ever done musically to the masses. 

Atlanta, while popular, isn‚Äôt enough to have him as ‚Äúone of the biggest stars in entertainment‚Äù. That description is pretty hilarious, he‚Äôs nowhere near that, which is why he sold 25k."

687,2020-03-27 23:17:49,fq5deb,"A lack of merch bundles. I‚Äôm sure BTS fans bought an ASSLOAD of merch that week, but all those shirts, hoodies, etc. just didn‚Äôt go to BTS‚Äô first week numbers."
688,2020-03-28 05:31:37,fq5deb,"> Each fan essentially bought 4 albums.

Huh, you would still be buying the literal music 4 times, it‚Äôs not a hoodie or lollipop. And you said physicals which are way less in numbers than digital sales."
689,2020-03-28 20:02:15,fq5deb,"You seem to be confusing BTS fans with other group fans which is rooted in racism because you won't see taylor swift fans the same as lady gaga because they're both american pop singers with blond hair image now will you? You don't use the word kpop to be neutral but to belittle them when idol music groups singing in Korean usually always have non-korean members anyways; it's not a nationality. Just call them Korean artists or Korean idol group. 

Also not only does billboard not count bulk buying BTS are the only korean artists with over a million sales for their individual albums and EPs without combining sales with several RIAA certifications in the US.

 Western artists also sell multiple versions of their albums and the weekend did that as well just go on his website. Taylor also sold pictures as merch. Cassettes, Vinyls, etc.

 Point of the matter is, everyone's doing it but only BTS are repeatedly selling a large amount of physicals for albums that cost over $20 when they're released, easily $25 one of the most expensive physicals and their fans still buy it, whether it's 1 version they really like or all 4 or none at all, not everyone can afford it and that's on a global scale. 

BTS are album artists, fans consume every track and know all their bsides while for most big western artists, come concert time, nobody knows the lyrics of their bsides, just the title songs. But for BTS who sing in korean their fans still do. 

American music industry relies on an overplayed radio single forcing people to know their songs and confuse it with liking the music when in reality it's manipulation.

BTS is organic fan interest, all they do is release content they don't ask to stream they ask to enjoy/ listen. 

Physicals and sold out stadiums without bundles provides more revenue than industry orchestrated stream numbers. Artists signed to US labels for more than just distribution get their singles near/at the top of every popular playlist used by businesses and lazy ppl so their music is automatically played everywhere by people who weren't even looking to listen to them nor paying attention.

BTS's streams and purchases are intentional and organic interest. They barely get 5 radio spins a day at the crack of midnight if the station managers feel like it, and they're never on several playlists, rarely ever placed high. Despite all that they have full stadiums and active listeners for all their albums. 

Western artists wished they had fans like BTS's because Armys are there despite the gag-order on radio and playlisting. Stadiums sell out without a cinch and there's no need to bend the knee to pr industries. However still they promote and they keep good relationships with other entertainers, they sill keep trying to appeal a greater range of people even though they're basically at the very top.

Bashing BTS, their efforts, their music, their promotion strategies and their fan efforts doesn't make you cool or western artists cooler. It's a disservice to other artists in the industry who actually wish they had a dedicated following but because they don't they gotta keep doing lotta knee bending or money spending for exposure, in hopes that it will equal tour attendance. 

We already have the end goal of most other artists, large tour attendance, but somehow that doesn't mean the music is good enough in your metrics. ü•¥"
690,2020-03-27 23:57:03,fq5deb,"No, it's not. He had another song drop before though: Feels Like Summer (42.26)"

693,2020-03-27 21:21:31,fq5deb,Yes it does. Look at Roddy Ricch. Relatively unknown outside of the hip hop community until about 6 months before the release of PEMFBA. Dropped a great album with songs like The Box and High Fashion which pushed his sales over 100k. Without a good quality album he wouldn‚Äôt have sold that much.
694,2020-03-27 21:12:43,fq5deb,"I completely disagree. If an artist makes an album that's a smash hit of course it'll change the first week numbers, more people will stream or buy it if it's hot and they're hearing about it from other people/on the radio."

711,2020-03-27 23:46:33,fq5deb,Yeah the people that are comparing Em to people not even half his age and call Em's numbers in comparison disappointing are only giving credit to his longevity. Nobody from his era of rap is doing what he's doing.
712,2020-03-28 13:22:46,fq5deb,">330k only

Yeah Kanye has fallen off popularity wise too. Not sure what your point is there never said otherwise. Also it isn't just only 330k. His sales have dropped off as well and none of his singles are sticking. The reason Roddy and post are always around is because people are still streaming the singles. Ems first week will continue to drop each week and it took him months to get to 670k and that's with the first few weeks being your highest sales. He might reach plat in 2021. But he won't in 2020."
713,2020-03-27 23:13:04,fq5deb,"Yeah, Astro did ridiculous numbers and his star has only risen since then, plus you know there would be mad merch bundles again although I think Billboard changed how they calculate the sales"

718,2020-03-27 23:03:06,fq5deb,And it had 3 songs all go #1 too. I think she had the 1 and 2 spot in the country at one point.
719,2020-03-28 07:29:13,fq5deb,Her and billie eilish next album will absolutely do 500k+. You have to look at the total sales. TUN has multiple top 10 hits and is one of thr best selling albums of 2019. The hype for her next project is 100% there. Same case with billie. I can see billie doing 600-700

744,2020-03-28 08:39:13,fq5deb,"Yeah he‚Äôs evolved. There a bunch of artists I wish would release a project like their original shit... not going to happen. They‚Äôve found the formula. They sell More records like this. 

Think Kendrick will release another section 80 ? Or drake another take care ? Nope. We can hope all we want but numbers  don‚Äôt lie and they arent about losing cash."
745,2020-03-28 08:25:55,fq5deb,That's never going to happen. The Weeknd is in his 30's now.
746,2020-03-28 07:53:00,fq5deb,Maybe if he released more music.
747,2020-03-28 09:13:11,fq5deb,"not even close, frank is a lot smaller than abel. many r&b artists bigger than frank"
748,2020-03-27 22:56:15,fq5deb,this is also only US sales and both of em are huge overseas
749,2020-03-27 22:43:10,fq5deb,I think Bad Bunny just recently overtook him. Balvin's just been around longer.
750,2020-03-28 02:22:55,fq5deb,"J Balvin has been constistently in the top 5 most streamed monthly artists on Spotify for at least a year, maybe more, while Bad Bunny right now is at number 13, so these numbers might be because Bad Bunny has a bigger crowd in the US, as these are just their US sales. They are both without a doubt on the top of the game right now, and Bunny especially is just getting bigger and bigger"
751,2020-03-28 18:29:39,fq5deb,"ya Bad Bunny definitely bigger now, makes better music too imo"

Data analytics firms work by using fake accounts to tweet messages with a specific hashtag/mention during a coordinated time period, using bots to retweet those messages, and then both the bots and message accounts to retweet responds. The goal is to get something into trending. It wouldn't surprise me if major labels or major celebrities's PR teams started using those tactics"

It's fairly inextricably linked with mass media's dissemination to common people because famous humans went from essentially being 'concepts' of people you'd never meet and legends would be born of them, to these figures who appeared in your life daily via television.

This is a good resource on the concept of being 'friends' with celebrities. http://digitalscholarship.unlv.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1963&context=thesesdissertations

The Beatles started it for the most part. Each member was strongly branded. 

That got taken to the next level with acts like N-SYNC. 

Idol culture in Asia played upon the rise of ""hikikomori"" and similar groups of insular people while being re-exported to the West.

I'd also look into the concept ""Big In Japan"". It deals with how celebrities can become figureheads for what is seen as foreign and mysterious. David Hasselhoff represents America to Germany is one good example. Backstreet Boys have been chart toppers in Asia to an unbelievable level compared to America."

nah"
800,2020-03-28 07:29:06,fq5deb,"Do you get what they were going for tho? Cus honestly, I think everybody is overthinking the hell out of this release. It think it‚Äôs simply that Donald is done and is hanging the music stuff up for a bit to just lay lower than he ever has. So he sabotaged his own release on purpose to show how apathetic he is. A person as in tune with the entertainment business as he is isn‚Äôt going to roll out his final album in this poor of a fashion and possibly think that it‚Äôs going to sell well. (Well, that is unless his head is that far up his ass at this point where he thinks he actually can, which could be true, bc he‚Äôs become a massive egomaniac as of late.) 

Especially when considering the rollout that was supposed to happen back in late 2018 where the label wanted to make him, and I roughly quote ‚Äúthe greatness, most defining artist of this generation.‚Äù I just don‚Äôt think they thought it would go over well. It‚Äôs the exact opposite of what they originally planned."

804,2020-03-27 23:56:47,fq5deb,He definitely is.  He's starring in blockbuster movies and This is America was the biggest music video of the year.

827,2020-03-28 01:41:06,fq5deb,"First week sales is more an indicator of artist hype and their rollout. If Glover dropped the same album after This is America it would've done 5x the numbers. Glover's new album is also his most critically acclaimed, so this argument doesn't make sense. 

Roddy was not unknown in the mainstream when he dropped. Ballin was a big hit and he capitalised on that hype, unlike Glover."
828,2020-03-28 01:48:47,fq5deb,Music is super subjective though more than other art forms mostly because there isn‚Äôt much of a consensus on what people think sounds good and makes a good song in comparison to movies and TV. I think Scorpion and Views were really bad albums I don‚Äôt get how anyone enjoys them but clearly people do Drake is the biggest artist in the world. I thought Camp and Because the Internet were amazing by Gambino but the sales of those combined would be lower than Scorpion.
829,2020-03-27 21:24:02,fq5deb,"Except that quality is all an opinion. It sold as well as it did because of memes more than your opinion. Roddy was already on the come up with that Mustard song and then the Box blew up because of memes. That's why it sold so well, not because you think it's good."
830,2020-03-28 04:37:03,fq5deb,"Honestly Roddy is one of those artist that I used to never hear about on reddit but constantly heard outside in the streets. Literally starting with Die Young I heard him in every car I was in during 2019, and if I‚Äôm being honest I like his mixtapes that year way more than his album. I felt like his album jus had better production and he kind of realized what people liked about his music and he jus emphasized it."

832,2020-03-27 23:52:25,fq5deb,"Roddy Ricch's album got big because it is catchy, accessible, and digestible. Roddy has a decent voice that was aided by basic beats popular in the genre. If we're being objective, the album is derivative and simplistic -- this was even acknowledged by fans and critics alike, who called him the ""Compton chameleon"" and whatnot. I don't think anything about it was quality"
833,2020-03-27 21:26:47,fq5deb,"the other guy said album quality and you said ""an album that's a smash hit""."
834,2020-03-27 21:14:08,fq5deb,"Except there are tons of great albums that don't sell well and tons of terror albums that do.

The quality of 3.15.20 isn't why it sold when it sold, it's because of the way it was released."
835,2020-03-27 22:08:03,fq5deb,So is your brain power. It's not just the 5 days of sales. His best selling album also only did 101k with a traditional rollout. You're confusing his general game with how popular his music is.

Why is Eminem supposed to get platinum sales within first few months this late in his career?

That is why the Kanye comparison, as i said Ye is the third biggest hip-hop artist of all time(commercially). 

Clearly this went over your head and you didn't even check the second comparison.

862,2020-03-28 14:18:29,fq5deb,"Well in Ed defence, Ed said that he used to rap along MMLP when he was 9 to get rid of stuttering (now imagine a 9 YO Ed rapping along Kim with a British accent)."
863,2020-03-28 22:55:46,fq5deb,Ed is really talented he's just lazy in his song writing
864,2020-03-28 11:17:41,fq5deb,"Can you imagine a actual Yandhi rolout?

-An actual album for which he took his time making it a coherent piece.

-Dope merch

-a tour / headlining festivals.

Man that would've been awesome"
865,2020-03-28 18:59:04,fq5deb,"Ahh gotchu. I was literally going off the surface level numbers and you showed me otherwise. Good to know, thanks!"
866,2020-03-27 21:44:50,fq5deb,"Nah no way.

Carter 5 was extremely hyped for years and bundled as hell

Funeral sold 138k with a fairly long rollout"
867,2020-03-28 08:32:07,fq5deb,dont forget the ticket bundles
868,2020-03-27 21:42:52,fq5deb,"I definitely think that it could be a one time deal. Especially because of the amount of merch he sold, the hype of the album, unlisted features, and the fact that he was dating Kylie at the time. Perfect storm of circumstances for him to get a crazy ass number for a first week."
869,2020-03-27 21:47:48,fq5deb,"ASTROWORLD has insane longevity too.

It had 1,985,000 SPS in 2018 ; 1,201,000 SPS in 2019 and is at 196,000 SPS in 2020 so far.

It may be his peak as a project (total units), or he may beat it with his next project it is hard to tell."
870,2020-03-29 03:30:14,fq5deb,"Apologies, I thought the standard and deluxe conrtibuted to the same number of streams."
871,2020-03-27 23:50:03,fq5deb,"Maybe not, very few are. Still rappers like Tech N9ne do similar numbers in first week sales, and he has no where near the audience of Eminem or Uzi."
872,2020-03-28 20:20:21,fq5deb,"think that's slightly different cuz kendrick going to section 80 would be several steps back in his musical evolution. everything he's made since has been way more experimental and interesting. by contrast the weeknd has put out good stuff since trilogy - after hours being the best of his post-trilogy work - but nothing has ever been as good as those first three mixtapes were. he peaked right there and everything since has been much more accessible and less interesting. musically, kendrick evolved, i think the weeknd just settled."
873,2020-03-28 09:42:34,fq5deb,Even Ella Mai bigger than Frank lmao.
874,2020-03-28 13:35:46,fq5deb,yea i might be wrong but i swear ive seen bad bunny work with and feature a lot more US artists than J balvin. that might have something to do with it
875,2020-03-28 07:41:02,fq5deb,"yeah so? never said it wasn't weird for gambino to do so. i mean it's art, he can call the songs what he wants. I just renamed them to remember them more easily."
876,2020-03-29 23:36:12,fq5deb,"Read my comment again, they mad because they tried to play the same games but didn't do it as well as the weeknd. His merch rollout was insane good, I would have copped a t shirt if I didn't already have merch from his starboy rollout."
877,2020-03-28 01:53:33,fq5deb,Lmao and they put all the albumless items at the bottom that‚Äôs gonna get ppl
878,2020-03-28 07:23:55,fq5deb,The Weeknd is a lot more accessible to a global audience. Uzi and Roddy are definitely more America-based in terms of popularity. Exactly right.
879,2020-03-28 03:05:25,fq5deb,I mean have you seen Taylor Swift stans?
880,2020-03-28 18:49:21,fq5deb,"Nah, those are Britney Spears fans"
881,2020-03-28 12:20:27,fq5deb,potayto potahto
882,2020-03-28 00:59:35,fq5deb,"I see what you mean, I have seen the ‚ÄúSTREAM [blank]‚Äù. They definitely are a thing but I feel like the KPOP fans are just an a complete nother level compared to US pop stans."
883,2020-03-28 14:23:42,fq5deb,Eh some ppl don‚Äôt deserve to live
884,2020-03-29 04:14:09,fq5deb,"Idk I disagree the kpop fans are vicious, but all stan cultures are horrible"
885,2020-03-28 03:36:51,fq5deb,"imo South Korea is amazing (plan to move there after graduating) but the culture is odd 

Though Seoul is rightfully recognized as a fashion city, and Koreans dress nice, their individual styles essentially copy eachother and whatever is meta 

The kpop craze is definitely alive and crazy in korea as well. I was in the front pit at a kpop concert/festival and all the artists (probably 20 groups amounting ~200 individuals) walked across the stage at the end and I was thrown into a mosh pit damn near riot with 14-20 yo Korean girls as they were trying to get as close to their favorite artist as possible."
886,2020-03-28 00:00:04,fq5deb,"Playboi Carti to me seems the most mentioned rapper in random places, his stans probably the closest i've seen."
887,2020-03-28 00:03:33,fq5deb,uzi stans are nowhere near as bad as Cardi B and (ironically) Em stans. Post Malone stans aren't that bad either
888,2020-03-28 00:46:43,fq5deb,"the huge ones are Nicki Minaj, Ari and Eminem. I never see anyone spamming post, sometimes cardi"
889,2020-03-28 03:19:48,fq5deb,"It's super normal dude. That's why we have stereotypes and cliques in the first place. Goth kids, scene kids, the artsy types, theater kids, nerds, etc. No difference to me between that jock who goes to basketball practice every day at 5am and that weeb making K-Pop compilations, they're both obsessed weirdos. Fact of the matter is everyone is weird, there is no normal lol."
890,2020-03-28 06:44:34,fq5deb,"When you say that the beatles members were ""branded"" do you mean intentionally as a way of marketing or organically?  Each beatle had a distinct personality and each played a visible role in the band. 
 They all sang for instance, even ringo.  I have thought that it was organic as they were just honest and that let their personalities shine through."
891,2020-03-28 17:19:58,fq5deb,"not dragging but when I see fans on twitter bragging about album sales while also putting down other artists for not having the sales BTS has, it irks me cause some of these fans act like some of the stratagies they use aren't a bit shady, seeing multiple albums bought just for the sake of higher numbers doesn't really seem authentic to me"
892,2020-03-28 17:43:06,fq5deb,Haha that‚Äôs mental. I‚Äôve got no issues with their music (not too big a fan of what I‚Äôve heard but doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre bad) I just find their rabid fan base mental
893,2020-03-28 18:40:59,fq5deb,"When you realise the streaming numbers come mostly from Playlists come talk. Many mainstream artists are in lots of top playlists, so they're being played/streamed even by people who don't particularly want to listen to that song in particular. (It can even be pushed down people's throats like yummy , by JB) Then if they had lots of streams, the're on the today's top hits, which gives them even more streams. 

Radio play also comes in here. More people hear it, and potentially more people like it and play it on streaming apps. Even mainstream artists don't have that many streams on non singles, unless they're really playlisted.

So, what you say isn't valid, as i haven't really seen the newest BTS songs on big playlists."
894,2020-03-28 18:31:45,fq5deb,"> Numbers don't lie they couldn't even hit 100k in streaming. 

""Your faves couldn't even pull in 150,000,000 streams in a week, they're not as big as you think"""
895,2020-03-28 02:03:32,fq5deb,"Bundles are still allowed, but it has to be at least $3.50 more than the item alone without the album, pretty sure The Weeknd just made it so that the non-bundle items are really hard to find on the store"
896,2020-03-28 01:45:37,fq5deb,They do
897,2020-03-28 01:54:10,fq5deb,Where did it say that?
898,2020-03-28 03:19:39,fq5deb,I mean it was just shit that made it to the album TPAB and then got cut when they were doing their final. So they were mostly finished just didn‚Äôt make it to the album concept. Bino‚Äôs album didn‚Äôt have that kinda excuse though he was rolling off HUGE success from redbone and this is America alone. He should have had a hit.
899,2020-03-28 03:57:15,fq5deb,"At least untitled unmastered was numbered 1-8. I know exactly which song is which. Gambino's was like 33.52 or something for each song, there's no way anyone's gonna remember that shit."
900,2020-03-28 04:26:10,fq5deb,bruh they're numbered 1 through 8... lol can you count to eight
901,2020-03-30 06:05:39,fq5deb,That ‚Äúone Kendrick album‚Äù also sold 350k first week. Pretty strange to compare the two. Gambino‚Äôs new project is nowhere near the relevancy of untitled unmastered
902,2020-03-28 04:30:32,fq5deb,I found out he had a new album by accident because I misclicked and opened a video for one of the songs on YouTube
903,2020-03-28 08:54:31,fq5deb,"I've been following the guy for ~10 years and believe they got something up their sleeve. I find it odd that none of his team has said any official goodbyes or any type of similar statements - then again the album release isn't a week old yet. Last year his producer (Ludwig) said the final project will be huge but we'll see if this was it or not. He and his team know how the media/internet works so I'm chilling with the album regardless.

Don't know how you see him as an egomaniac when he hasn't had an interview since Lion King (last July I think). It's been quiet for him since last festival season. I get the same feeling from Frank Ocean.

Where did you see that he was supposed to release back in 2018 btw? I've seen images of the label's timeline that had his name in 2018 but it wasn't 100% confirmed - same in 2019."
904,2020-03-28 15:45:57,fq5deb,"Lol you start off by saying everybody is overthinking it then you proceed to fabricate and vindicate him through an elaborate argument. 

‚ÄúNo guys you don‚Äôt get it , he actually MEANT to sell poorly, he just wants people to stop listening to him! He‚Äôs a genius!‚Äù"
905,2020-03-28 20:08:21,fq5deb,Irrelevant? I think your the one out of touch with reality lol. Dudes concerts sell out fast as hell and Atlanta is one of the biggest shows of the 2010s. You and your try hard white friends may not listen to him but that don‚Äôt mean shit in the grand scheme of things.
906,2020-03-29 00:15:49,fq5deb,"Number one 1 single, another single that went 5x platinum, in one of the highest grossing movies of all time, has 2 seasons of his incredibly popular/ acclaimed show on the way, won countless Emmys & Grammys, played Lando in a Star Wars movie, when he played Outside Lands drew what they claimed to the biggest audience they ever had. 


Yea, no one knows this guy."
907,2020-03-28 20:17:35,fq5deb,are you trolling? he is very well known by the public lol
908,2020-03-27 22:41:50,fq5deb,That album with promo and singles did 101k first week. This album had no promo and was dropped on a Sunday. And it seems to have gotten a lukewarm reception
909,2020-03-27 23:45:45,fq5deb,"My grandma knows GUMMO, it doesn't mean shit"
910,2020-03-28 00:01:02,fq5deb,Everyone in the UK knows Donald / childish including my mum
911,2020-03-27 22:34:19,fq5deb,"If he‚Äôs as big as you say he is he wouldn‚Äôt sell 25k even with releasing on a Sunday

he‚Äôs in the tier below, at least musically"
912,2020-03-28 11:15:36,fq5deb,"The dude was Lando Calrissian and headlined Coachella, he‚Äôs an A-list celebrity and it‚Äôs shocking he sold this little"
913,2020-03-28 12:43:18,fq5deb,These critics gave the big day good critical reception lmao. They love ‚Äòartsy‚Äô somewhat left field rappers
914,2020-03-28 11:48:46,fq5deb,"The tour doesn‚Äôt start until late June in the U.S, it‚Äôs a possibility it won‚Äôt get canceled. We probably won‚Äôt know until mid-late May whether it‚Äôll get postponed or some dates will be postponed since it‚Äôs too early to tell."
915,2020-03-28 06:07:17,fq5deb,"True, but just to gauge it, I feel that the more ‚Äúsuper fans‚Äù would be the ones to collect this albums, while more intermediate-core fans buy t shirts and hoodies."
916,2020-03-28 06:04:07,fq5deb,his ass
917,2020-03-28 05:14:37,fq5deb,"I mean he clearly took a bit from this song https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/06/childish-gambino-this-is-america-plagiarism/


He wont admit it but i imagine his legal department wouldnt let him release it. Its not confirmed but its clear enough to me to most likely be the case."
918,2020-03-28 18:03:33,fq5deb,yeah he's getting his bag from other avenues besides music
919,2020-03-27 22:40:42,fq5deb,Very true. Sold more than Gambino this week 3 months after release.
920,2020-03-28 06:38:39,fq5deb,I think Post Malone did the same type of thing with Stoney.
921,2020-03-28 04:29:20,fq5deb,"It isn't his most critically acclaimed? Awaken my love is. Thus album is largely garbage, I've listened 3 times trying to give it a fair shot."
922,2020-03-28 03:56:58,fq5deb,I said he was unknown mainstream up until 6 months of his release.
923,2020-03-27 21:30:55,fq5deb,"You‚Äôre right. Quality is opinion based. But if a large amount a people like an album and think its good, they‚Äôll stream it more, hence driving up sales. You are missing the point. A good album does equate to more album sales. There is no way that you actually think that if an artist put out a terrible album compared to a great one that they would sell the same."
924,2020-03-27 22:57:29,fq5deb,Can‚Äôt just be memes. Roddy even outsold Gambino this week.
925,2020-03-27 22:40:55,fq5deb,[deleted]
926,2020-03-27 23:03:41,fq5deb,"I'm with you in this, Roddy also got a lot of attention off of Nipsey Hussle's death because he was featured on Nipsey's last single which technically got Roddy a Grammy. I don't think Roddy is very talented at all."
927,2020-03-27 22:39:32,fq5deb,Sleeping? I‚Äôm a huge Roddy Ricch fan.
928,2020-03-27 22:10:46,fq5deb,"I said a better album, not a better quality album. Not my fault if the other guy misread."

932,2020-03-28 09:33:01,fq5deb,Leaks are frequent for all major artists. It's just too difficult for a lot of projects not to leak these days
933,2020-03-28 02:18:52,fq5deb,"The hell is up with all of these pop stars coming out of nowhere and blowing the fuck up. Before her album dropped Billie Eilish was mildly popular but wasn't close to superstar levels of fame, but now last time I checked she's the 2nd most streamed artist globally on Spotify. I literally had never heard of Dua Lipa before this year's Grammy's and now she all of a sudden has 53 million monthly listeners on Spotify"
934,2020-03-28 01:56:16,fq5deb,"I‚Äôve been thinking what a Weeknd Bruno collaboration would be like, they‚Äôre the two closest things to Mike rn so I think their talents together would be fire"

Iuno why that's hard for y'all to just admit. 24 years you can't be serious counting infinite lmao. That's like counting shit artists put on MySpace before they blew up. SSLP came out in 1999. It's 21 years ago

937,2020-03-28 11:35:29,fq5deb,"Also people love to always bring the merch aspect up but Travis has built a solid rep in street wear culture, fans actually want to rock his shit. There‚Äôs only a few mainstream hip hop artists that have that much pull with the merch."

940,2020-03-28 15:12:16,fq5deb,did the weeknd have bundles? (genuine question)
941,2020-03-28 15:47:13,fq5deb,"Oh shit, that's crazy. Has that ever been done before?"
942,2020-03-27 22:08:03,fq5deb,"Beyonce with a proper rollout can do it. Surprise drop, Nah."
943,2020-03-27 23:42:28,fq5deb,Lady Gaga could still make those numbers
944,2020-03-27 22:50:55,fq5deb,Ariana hasn't either
945,2020-03-27 21:51:41,fq5deb, if adele has some skepta feats i'd listen to that shit

949,2020-03-27 21:39:57,fq5deb,"If jt rolls out an album with a good lead single he could. The lead singer for his last album was Filthy, which was a bad song flopped hard."
950,2020-03-28 14:39:45,fq5deb,"Yeah for sure, I actually like his music. And to be honest his song with Em on Revival was one of the better songs lol."
951,2020-03-28 19:31:23,fq5deb,Ya no prob
952,2020-03-27 23:04:18,fq5deb,Fairly long rollout? Didn‚Äôt he announce and then drop it within like a week?
953,2020-03-27 22:09:35,fq5deb,"Plus, it's actually a good album. So many listenable tracks even in 2020"
954,2020-03-27 22:47:48,fq5deb,he still sold 1.2 mil in 2019 and 196k in 2020 as mentioned above. You guys give too much credit to the merch
955,2020-03-27 21:59:12,fq5deb,200k SPS in 2020 is actually insane
956,2020-03-28 15:21:03,fq5deb,No shes not lol not even close

958,2020-03-28 07:53:20,fq5deb,i was just sayin that most people arent gonna do that which means less sales u kno
959,2020-03-29 23:55:57,fq5deb,"They didnt tried to play the same game because BTS didnt put merch for their album or used their bundles from their upcoming stadium tour in the USA.And it doesnt even matter how good tshirts are if BTS made tshirts available too they will definitely sell more then Weeknd's because they have a more dedicated fanbase.

I for one im all for real sales not merch or ticket sales and i dont even know why Billboard decides to count them."
960,2020-03-28 12:23:55,fq5deb,"youre 100% right. the best example of this was the comment section of that ""ON"" song when BTS first released it. the comment section was literally filled with people acting as if breaking some random youtube record for BTS was the most important goal on the planet and when they eventually didnt break the record the comment section ended up being flooded with people seeming legitimately sad and disappointed in themselves for not breaking some stupid record. other pop stars (like taylor or ariana grande or billie eilish) have bad comment sections but this was on a whole nother level"
961,2020-03-28 08:39:14,fq5deb,"It can be argued that other fandoms are more vicious, or toxic, but nothing can compete with the organization and mobility of kpop-stans. They are by far the most outgoing fandom, and appear almost everywhere. Kpop fans in general are a very organized fandom, which can be used for good, like with fundraising, but that also means all of the toxic stans are organized too. That organization is the thing that US pop stans lack, to reach the unfathomable levels of toxicity the kpop stans have. It‚Äôs like comparing random cults to the Korean mafia."
962,2020-03-28 01:00:59,fq5deb,Nothing is like the Taylor stardom lets get real. It‚Äôs incredibly vicious.

The jock is practicing and training to get better at a sport. Playing sports is healthy. Wanting to get better at something healthy you do is healthy. He's not weird in the slightest.

You can't say the same for people who make kpop compilations, whatever that is. What a crazy ass comparison."
967,2020-03-28 07:56:09,fq5deb,"They werent allowed to make their relationships public so that female fans can imagine themselves with them. Its like how boybands have the token buff, the token boyish charm, and the quirky one. It's partially PR, partially the member's organic nature, and also at the record label level, handpicking members for a band."
968,2020-04-04 22:39:13,fq5deb,"late, but anyway

you were, in fact, dragging. also, a buy is a buy. If bulk buying isn't allowed, then people ain't idiotic enough to bulk buy. If they want to collect more than one version within the limits, tho, that's their prerogative. They are still buying with their own money each single version.

it's in no way comparable to you buying a lollipop and getting a free album thrown at you and calling that an album sale. it ain't shady, as you say. you're buying the actual album and BTS' fans are allowed to brag about that when so many artists succumb to doing bundles in the most desperate ways (and let's not even talk the issue with radio, playlisting and payola) all while BTS' numbers check out on every level. They ain't selling out stadiums in mere hours on your faves' turf with nothing, all while some of the ppl who seem like they're surpassing them have a hard time selling out arenas. That's what gets me. BTS' numbers hold up to scrutiny. 

The only thing BTS doesn't have as much of is longevity and that's due to the fact that it's pretty clear they were blacklisted by radios bc they ain't doing payola (same applies to streaming platforms) like the rest of them and they sing mainly in Korean. No big news there, but it was confirmed with an article yesterday. BTS are purposefully being sabotaged by the industry, and you don't need to work so hard to sabotage somebody with fake numbers, believe me. Despite that, their numbers still surpass or match their peers who use all sorts of gimmicks, do get pushed by radio and playlisting a lot, and have a hard time selling out their shows. Do the math."
969,2020-03-28 18:51:25,fq5deb,"IMO, all fanbases are like that. They all strive to show the world why you should appreciate what they like, it's just loud minorities being taken as the norm, when they aren't. Non-intrusive fan accounts aren't really seen much, yet they're the majority of the fandom. And again, i don't really think they're really rabid, even football (soccer) fans i would classify as *extremely* passionate, not rabid, though i could understadn why people whould classify them as mental/crazy (for both football and certain music acts), the again the Beatles also had ""rabid"" fans.

And also, there's a lot of racism towards asians in general, so fans are probably a bit protective because of that. 

After all this, i'm not saying BTS fans are the best (and I'm NOT including kpop here), no fandom is great, but they have done great things like [this](https://medium.com/bulletproof/how-bts-inspires-their-army-to-do-good-229800ff17a4) or [this account](https://twitter.com/oneinanarmy?lang=es). I wish more fandoms with power did good deeds, i've only really seen BTS fans and star wars fans do so."

It had every single thing about their plan for down to the T. Rough release dates, playlists they we‚Äôre targeting on Spotify, fan/VR experiences, etc. I have some screenshots of it on my phone. A few of us saw it and were going nuts. Within minutes of word getting out on here (and on Twitter bc I tweeted RCA sarcastically thanking them for such a gem), the site was completely pulled and when you went to the link it was just the go daddy domain.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_albums_by_year_in_the_United_States

You really want to call of these albums ""quality?"" Go ahead, call Drake's Scorpion a *quality* album, please. 

Quality is absolutely irrelevant to sales and it always has been. It baffles me that music has existed for this long and people still do not understand this. What *sells well* is literally just what is popular in the mainstream. Often that is very unoriginal and uninspired music. Therefore popularity != quality."

[Critics overwhelmingly decided that *Yeezus* was the best album of 2013.](https://www.metacritic.com/feature/critics-pick-top-ten-albums-of-2013)

It was the worst selling Kanye album at the time. It had the 4th biggest drop off from first week to second week of all time

#Snoop Dogg - *No Limit Top Dogg*

Went from 3rd highest first week of 1998 (*Da Game Is to Be Sold, Not to Be Told*) to 187k and not even breaking top 10 of 1999.

Considered to be a top 4 Snoop album. Has the 3rd highest score among Snoop albums on RYM, while *Da Game Is to Be Sold, Not to Be Told* has the 14th best score.

#Nas - *The Lost Tapes*

*Stillmatic* was the 6th highest first week of 2001. *Lost Tapes*, widely regarded to be a top 3 Nas project, sold 70k first week in 2002.

#Meek Will - *DC4*

Went from 245k (*Dreams Worth More Than Money*) to <100k first week

Still Brazy is widely-considered to be YG's best album, but it only sold 38K first week, which was even lower than its sales projections that [publications were calling ""disappointing.""](https://djbooth.net/features/2016-06-20-yg-still-brazy-first-week) In contrast, My Krazy Life sold 61K first week and Stay Dangerous sold 56K. You also can't argue that YG ""isn't a big artist"" because My Nigga, Left Right, and Who Do You Love? were hits.

#Mac Miller - Swimming and The Divine Feminine 

Both of these albums took a few years for listeners to appreciate, which was evident in its low first-week sales of 66K for Swimming and 48K for The Divine Femine. Many were calling this disappointing considering Blue Side Park sold 144K, WMWTSO sold 102K, and GO:OD AM sold 73K.

This should really be obvious to anyone who thinks about this critically. **First-week sales are primarily related to an artist's current popularity.** Why would quality projects that take longer to appreciate sell well *first week*? Why would a quality piece of work that isn't constantly replayable and radio-friendly sell well first week?"

> Meek Will - DC4

He, at the time of release, was not a ""big artist"" because he was still battling his image post-Back2Back. On top of that, DC4 was released as a commercial mixtape with not much push vs Champions that sold well after he reintroduced himself to the mainstream and created an arguably better album

So I went home and shot baskets in our driveway for six hours, until my mother called me in. The next day, I was good enough that you wouldn‚Äôt notice I was bad. And I realized my superpower.‚Äù 

That quote sounds more like somebody who is sure of themselves and where they‚Äôre at in life more than they ever have been before. He directly addresses depression and suicide there and pretty much says ‚Äúthat won‚Äôt be me bc I‚Äôm so great at life.‚Äù Sure successful people can have it all and still be depressed, but to me it doesn‚Äôt seem like he was here. He was both self aware while not being self aware at the same time."

1070,2020-03-28 07:13:28,fq5deb,"I'm not talking about fan reception to the album.  Hence why I said ""critically acclaimed"". 

And there's 3x as many reviews in both user and critic rating for AML so your point is moot either way."
1071,2020-03-28 02:11:46,fq5deb,"The lead single, God's Plan, was released before the album with *Scary Hours*. It had no competition. It was also very panned and skewed toward the negative critically. Similarly, Nice For What was released two months before the album, so it had no competition. In My Feelings was simply the most danceable track released with Scorpion and had a trend attached to it that hence pushed it to the #1 spot. You also forget Nonstop, generally not well-received critically, peaked at #2. 

Top-charting songs are generally just replayable or danceable. Unless you want to tell me that songs like Silento's Watch Me or The Chainsmoker's Closer are ""quality,"" then clearly quality is irrelevant to sales"
1072,2020-03-27 22:16:50,fq5deb,You‚Äôre completely right. Culture 2 was nowhere near as big or as loved as Culture 1. Lil Yachty fell off cause Teenage Emotions was ass and killed a lot of his hype. Quality will always matter.

Well sure but it's also not the biggest factor. Album rollout, release date, having 1 or 2 big singles are all probably more important."

>On average, a higher quality album will sell more than a low quality for the SAME artist and that‚Äôs a fact.

It's literally not a fact, because higher quality is an opinion. Even if you've used a consensus then you've missed the point because then you're just proving that popular things are popular, not what good is."

Not to mention you ignored half my examples.

If Gambino achieved what he was going for w whatever the fuck this album is called it wouldn‚Äôt have sold well, because it‚Äôs not an album w conventional singles. There are good art pop albums that do a similar thing. They don‚Äôt sell that much.

If Donald Glover made an album in the vein of Suicide‚Äôs self titled it would tank even if it was better than that album. If Donald Glover made the best no wave album it would tank"

> Although by the end of the year critics say it was the best album of 2013, the overwhelming **popular opinion**, at least amongst black hip hop fans, was that it was his worst album

If you're acknowledging that popularity is separate from quality, and then use the argument that Yeezus wasn't received well popularly to debate its quality, aren't you contradicting yourself?

Album sales are about marketing and popularity. Popularity doesn't equal quality. 

I don't know why music fans have such a hard time excepting that where fans of other art forms don't. Like movies fans aren't arguing that Endgame is the best movie of last year. For the most part they accept that quality and popularity don't go hand in hand."

No there aren't lmao. Obsession is bad regardless of how well your career or life turns out. That's the whole point. You trying to assign ""good"" and ""bad"" is stupid, that's middle school thinking bro lmfao"
1085,2020-03-28 22:00:16,fq5deb,"Right, ergo any interest, including sports, can be taken to the point of obsession, something kids will often do, hence cliques. That's the point they were trying to make."

1088,2020-03-28 02:16:29,fq5deb,My point is it was fairly monolithic when it dropped last week. Now it‚Äôs sat for a bit many seem to have disappeared.

1090,2020-03-28 07:27:18,fq5deb,"Personally when discussing works that are 'critically acclaimed', I'm not limiting the pool of critics to large groups like Pitchfork and The Guardian. I think it's also important to take into account the main consumers of the product, all the fans.

If the album had a 9/10 rating from critics, and a 3/10 rating from fans, I don't think we'd label it as critically acclaimed. And that's not to imply that only the opinion of fans matter, I think the score from official critics and the user score should hold about equal weight."
1091,2020-03-28 02:21:33,fq5deb,"So I'm Upset flopped because it had too much competition? Try again. That song charted #19 first week under a year old Imagine Dragons song. It flopped because it seriously lacked the polish of the other two singles and didn't get people listening with a strong melody or memorable lyrics etc.

Also Closer is a quality song lol. Didn't realise it was suddenly the benchmark for unlistenable shit. That was my jam in 2016 - I still love the melody and the Halsey feature"

the whole thing of him being off his 2 biggest albums should've made yeezus a commercial success, but because black ppl didn't think it was good it didn't get plays. It wasn't until blogs (read the whites) said they loved the album did it get that second life it really needed"

1101,2020-03-27 22:23:22,fq5deb,"Yes he‚Äôs a big artist. At ACL this year he arguably had the biggest crowd of the entire event (The same night had Cardi B, Billie Eilish, 21 Savage, etc). And do you not know RedBone and This is America? He‚Äôs a big artist just from his music side alone."
1102,2020-03-27 21:55:24,fq5deb,"Just because ""some"" of the sales are based on popularity doesn't mean that those sales don't fluctuate based on the quality. 

If uzi released an absolutely trash album where every song was unlistenable would he still sell nearly 400k first week? No.

The sales would drop off. He would still sell like 100,000+ because there's alot of hype behind him but people aren't gonna listen to it on repeat. If every song was as popular as XO Tour Life it would sell more because people are listening to stuff on repeat. Idk how you can't see that.

It's a combination of hype and quality.  

Did you listen to the Gambino album? Which songs do you still listen to off of it?"

1106,2020-03-28 14:30:44,fq5deb,"See, here‚Äôs the thing, Donald‚Äôs kinda of always in this perpetual state of depression. His work for the better part of the past 8 years has always been either super depressing and nihilistic, braggadocious, or both. If he wasn‚Äôt depressed, everything he‚Äôs done would be completely different. So to say he‚Äôs depressed here and not jerking himself off is meh for me, bc he seems like he knows that he‚Äôs finally in the driver‚Äôs seat for good in this interview. He didn‚Äôt overachieve, he‚Äôs finally gotten to where‚Äôs he‚Äôs always wanted to be, and if you asked him there‚Äôs no doubt in my mind he would say the same. And if you look at the timeline of his life, the one thing that kind of eased him into just chilling and enjoying life is his son. The dude has a whole ass family now, even though he said many times that he never would. This is the same guy that said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the shit, been the shit, fuck a humble brag.‚Äù He‚Äôs always known and thought he‚Äôs great. But now there‚Äôs literally nobody to stop him from doing or saying anything. He strokes himself off more than ever in this interview and seems as little depressed as ever in it, even though there‚Äôs hints of it still being there."
1107,2020-03-28 14:16:40,fq5deb,I never read the whole interview but that quote seems pretty true to me. There's definitely days where I realize I've been doing the same things everyday and it makes me wonder why I'm even trying
1108,2020-03-29 19:01:27,fq5deb,So he was in a kids movie that flopped. Really relevant there
1109,2020-03-28 02:25:07,fq5deb,"I think with album drops the majority of existing fans are going to be checking the album thread first and upvoting their own opinions and downvoting the dissenters. Mainly to do with their own bias and prioritizing listening to the album first before casuals get around to checking it out.

That's why you generally get better conversations and varying opinions in the follow up threads for albums."
1110,2020-03-28 05:58:59,fq5deb,It‚Äôs because fantano hated on it and a lot of people just copy his opinion
1111,2020-03-28 07:57:10,fq5deb,"The term critically acclaimed means highly received by critics. Fan rating has no bearing. 

What you describe in your scenario would still be a critically acclaimed album, but one that is not universally or commercially acclaimed. There is a distinction between terms. 

I don't disagree with how much weight user score should hold, it's just got no bearing over what critical acclaim means."
1112,2020-03-28 02:43:20,fq5deb,"I don't think charting at #6 is a flop. First-week sales and chart debut rankings are generally just measuring what is *immediately* replayable from an album/artist with hype preceding them. 

By competition, I thought it was obvious I meant other songs *from the album*. it's a lot easier to get a song released as a standalone/promo single to the top for multiple reasons, namely because that is the sole newest product from the artist and all marketing efforts can be pushed toward that one song. So when songs like God's Plan and Nice For What get released months in advance of an album, they have an easy path to the Top 5. But when songs that get released as apart of albums spanning 25 tracks long and all tailored for mainstream audiences, it doesn't necessarily have a clear path. 

It wasn't even planned that I'm Upset would be the next single, it was just something that happened a month after the album release for certification purposes because of the single's success... Which ultimate retracts from your argument.

Not that your argument really makes sense anyhow. I mean, Kendrick Lamar's LOVE. also debuted at #18. Are you going to call that a ""flop?"" And like I mentioned, there are multiple songs *from Scorpion* that contradict your argument.

Also, frankly, if you think ""Closer"" is quality, then maybe you align more with the ""mainstream audience"" crowd."
1113,2020-03-27 22:54:23,fq5deb,"But there‚Äôs still a bit of quality to generic. Yes, it‚Äôs generic, but if it‚Äôs catchy, it‚Äôs still enjoyable in a way. There are plenty of albums that people just don‚Äôt fuck with at all no matter what."
1114,2020-03-27 23:59:58,fq5deb,Generic but mediocre is still passable because it's similar enough to generic but good music. When you go more experimental you get high risk/high reward.

1119,2020-03-27 21:53:45,fq5deb,"I don't know if he is or not. He's definitely a very popular person but that's different then being a popular artist. Like Will Smith is super popular but he wouldn't sell records like he used to now because he's not a popular artist.

Gambino has never been that big of an artist, as you can see by his previous album sales.

It's not defensive, it's me making an argument. You seem to be the one that is getting defensive here mentioning that over and over."
1120,2020-03-27 22:04:03,fq5deb,Lmao no he doesn't. This is America was number 1 for two weeks because of a huge video and then fell off pretty quickly.
1121,2020-03-27 22:00:37,fq5deb,didn't know Gambino made Uptown Funk
1122,2020-03-27 22:32:34,fq5deb,"
>And do you not know RedBone and This is America?

I do. One peaked at 12 on billboard and one went to number one for two weeks because a huge video.

That or anything else you mentioned doesn't mean that he is a huge artist. His past album says aren't very big selling 101, 72 and 52k previously. He's never jarred higher than 5th on the top 200. Seems like a lot of hard evidence that he isn't as popular as you seem to think."
1123,2020-03-27 22:00:58,fq5deb,"I'm not even sure how to reply to this because you don't seem to get the point at all. Popularity is by far the most important factor in sales. Quality is purely personal opinion so it's absolutely meaningless to how well something sells.

Uzi did release a worse than mediocre album to me and it sold great because he's super popular. That doesn't mean it's good. Now you can think it's the best album ever but then we're in a discussion of our opinions. It doesn't related to album sales because those are based in opinions. I guess if you define quality as pleasing the most people then it effects sales but that isn't the definition of quality it's the definition of popularity.


>Did you listen to the Gambino album? Which songs do you still listen to off of it?

I don't listen to songs I listen to albums generally."
1124,2020-03-27 22:00:35,fq5deb,EA was absolutely trash tho so you're proving his point
1125,2020-03-28 22:13:49,fq5deb,"Not really, very much illustrates their point that kids often take things to the point of obsessions and form their characters around them. It's supposed to be something they grow out of eventually, and that's when you get a well adjusted adult."
1126,2020-03-28 18:59:41,fq5deb,"I mean in ""Telegraph Ave"" he said he's thinking about himself and think's he'd be bad at it (having a family/kids). As for quoting the song ""You See Me"", I view that as ""I've been nerdy and self-conscious for so long that I want to say I am the shit and GTFO out of my way"" and it's empowering to me because *I'm* like that. I'd like to believe he created those lyrics for the people in the same state. That's why I've followed artists like him because he's relatable to me. I love belting out the braggadocious lyrics that you'd hear in songs like that or Royalty or Sweatpants because it'd get me out of my depressive funk. And whenever he'd have interviews (mainly from 2011-2015) I understood where he was coming from - but him trying to be deep is pretentious to a lot of people here so I understand that. It's like how Kanye rants and goes off tangent but I understand his struggle to speak and I get the big picture of what he's trying to execute - but it's easy to call him crazy. Anyways I doubt Donald's team is full of Yes Men. From whatever interviews/articles/tweets come from them it seems they have the same mentality as Don which is why they've been part of his team for so long.

Also just saw [this post](https://preview.redd.it/bvgrkmokagp41.jpg?width=680&auto=webp&s=bcb5a655cd2a04d2fef747a7c97b55947251da0e) from /r/donaldglover. Think of that what you will. But to me could explain why it's all quiet from his side."

1130,2020-03-28 08:19:35,fq5deb,"I know this is just semantics, but I would argue that since fans are critiquing the album, they are considered critics, and therefore the public reception should be taken into account when discussing an album's critical acclaim. Just my opinion.

AML is definitely his most critically acclaimed album"
1131,2020-03-28 13:30:52,fq5deb,"I'm upset was released a month before the album, which kinda negates most of this comment. It was totally planned, and it flopped because it sucks and audiences didn't enjoy it.

1137,2020-03-27 23:14:48,fq5deb,"I mean you're like objectively right. He's never been a huge seller so he's not a big artist if we looking at numbers, Kendrick, Cole, Drake, Frank, Kanye, Tyler, Post, Travis, Weeknd and many more have all been bigger than him"
1138,2020-03-27 22:03:39,fq5deb,"whatever, it might not be *the* biggest, but my point still stands."
1139,2020-03-27 22:58:31,fq5deb,Omg I‚Äôm talking to a moron
1140,2020-03-27 22:06:59,fq5deb,"You didnt even respond to any point I made at all and completely contradicted yourself.

I asked did you listen to the gambino ALBUM and you said you only listen to albums lmao.

Lets use Don Tolivers album then. You said it was amazing and it only sold like 40k. 
If the album was terrible you probably would have only listened to it once or twice.

If you really like the album you would have listened to it alot more than once or twice, thus boosting the album sales. This point is literally indisputable 

Doesnt matter how popular you are, quality will drive sales RELATIVE to your popularity as an artist. Yea hes not going to sell anywhere near lil uzi or eminem because they are more popular.  BUT if his album was trash it would have sold alot less either way"
1141,2020-03-27 22:01:33,fq5deb,That album was mid. Either way it doesnt disprove MY point
1142,2020-03-28 22:16:06,fq5deb,Yes really. A person who forms their character around good things are better than a person who forms their characters around bad things.
1143,2020-03-28 19:19:54,fq5deb,"Soooo what‚Äôs your point? You‚Äôre talking to somebody who was in the same boat as you. Donald was my hero.

You asked did I listen to the album and what songs do I still listen to off of it. I said I listen to albums not songs. That in my mind answers both of those questions. If you need it spelled out, yes I have heard the album and all the songs because that's how I listen to albums.

>Lets use Don Tolivers album then. You said it was amazing and it only sold like 40k. 
If the album was terrible you probably would have only listened to it once or twice.

I have only listened to it once or twice. Still really liked it.


>If you really like the album you would have listened to it alot more than once or twice, thus boosting the album sales. This point is literally indisputable 

See above.


>Doesnt matter how popular you are, quality will drive sales RELATIVE to your popularity as an artist. 

Except that popularity is all that matters. Quality is an individual assessment. Popularity is a group assessment.

The selection period is usually the calendar year, the academic year or the sporting season.

What you're suggesting is if you criticise something, then you are a critic. Which is true in a general sense, but there is an exception. Outside of creative works you'd be correct, but in works of art we are using the second term. You're applying the wrong meaning to the area we are discussing. 

You can be judgemental of anything and therefore a critic. For example I can judge the way a person sits, I am therefore a critic of their sitting.

What? A month doesn't factor in **athleticism** you dimwit lmfao, it plays a factor in **school/youth athletes**. Meaning, it only plays a factor in structured play. Which by definition, isn't even a hobby anyway. It's something you do.

Because it's not how the association fallacy works, which is what you were accusing me of, you don't seem to understand it (or you totally misunderstand the transitive property). Take a minute to read the wiki article and you might actually learn something.

He used to play for ManU, which at that point of time was the most prestigious club to play for, and EPL was the richest league combined with the influence English media had over the then footballing narrative.mHe was the Captain of a star-studded Engish football team. It was almost a dream team of sorts. He won many crucial matches for England. Most importantly he was one of the best dead ball player of that time and one with good looks, unlike the handful others. Dead ball specialists always have had a huge fan following because of them being at the centre stage during climax phases of matches.

And as for the need to be famous? The answer is brand endorsements. He used to be the highest earning footballer in spite of him not being amongst the top 10 footballers of his time by a distance!"

1238,2020-03-27 19:17:08,fq26sk,"Her music is most popular with young/teenager girls so yeah, kind of like Bieber in terms of being a polarizing figure. 

But turn on the television for a few hours in Japan and you'll probably see her at some point. Or go to Don Quixote and you'll see ads she's in and you'll hear her music over the speaker. And her music plays on the streets of Harajuku pretty much all the time. 

I guess the negative reviews would be a mixture of target audience and oversaturation. But she is plenty popular in Japan."
1239,2020-03-27 20:15:30,fq26sk,"I think it might be a natural human response of ‚Äúwhat have you done for me lately‚Äù, so many of these bands churn out material so fast. You can easily get lost. What makes matters worse is that she is cared for by the record industry. She is always involved in their awards ceremonies and wins awards even though she hasn‚Äôt released anything. The last bit would be that she‚Äôs been at it for close to a decade. Her evolutions are small and precise but her audience is growing up so while it‚Äôs cool that she can still do crayon it‚Äôs not something the mid twenty something is looking forward to. Love her to bits. She just needs to make a stance."
1240,2020-04-01 21:24:25,fq26sk,"Maybe like any pop star, she's probably got her haters. You see plenty of that here in America...I'm guilty of it too. I hate american pop stars mostly, but I friggin' love Kyary-chan. 

&#x200B;

Don't worry, no matter how many people in Japan who might hate her, my love for Kyary outweighs it. xD"
1241,2020-03-28 11:58:01,fq26sk,"I wonder if that has anything to do with her pedophilia allegations from 2012-2013? Was that ever resolved? I recently found out about this and didn't think it was a big deal but apparently to some it was.

In case for anyone that doesn't know, she was fond of an 11 year old boy who was part of a band that often opened for her during her shows. His name was P-chan. Her LINE messages between her and the kid circulated around where she said some pretty questionable things like ""I love you"", ""Come sleep with me"", ""You're so cute"". There was also photos of her sitting on his lap, etc."
1242,2020-03-27 21:49:52,fq26sk,"thanks, this helps me understand a lot better! I guess because abroad, you never see or hear about her here, unless you search for her, so it‚Äôs much easier for us to enjoy her in healthy doses.

I‚Äôm 22 and I get that i‚Äôm not the target audience, but all my friends (same age as me) that I show KPP, love her. It‚Äôs weird. I understand the appeal to children, but it‚Äôs just as appealing to American young adults lol"
1243,2020-03-28 16:00:06,fq26sk,"About that. Did P-chan or his parents pressed charges against Kyary? 
Beause all I read about these allegations come from one English thread on Twitter (which was linked here) and all the Japanese tabloids who talk about it has been written the following days after the tweet's publication and quoting it."

I'm a 30 year old guy and I'm not alone in my fandom! I just think that a lot of entertainers who appeal towards younger audiences are naturally more heavily criticized than other entertainers. But you'll find all age groups who love KPP! And her presence is *everywhere* in pop-culture focused parts of Japan."
1246,2020-03-28 17:29:24,fq26sk,"Dont think so. Then again, and sorry to say this, but this is Japan we are talking about. So I doubt anything came out of it."
1247,2020-03-29 13:54:57,fq26sk,"From [this tweet](https://www.reddit.com/r/kyarypamyupamyu/comments/earjm9/kyary_called_out_on_twitter_for_harassing_dancer/) published in December 2019, accusing Kyary of paedophilia and sexual harassment toward her former back dancer P-chan, bringing some translated post from her blog date of 2012.

As I said, I couldn't find anything of the sort in the Japanese media and forum except five tabloid articles who appeared after the tweet publication and brings nothing else but quoting the tweet.

Japanese is not my first language so I may miss something, but it doesn't seem to have ever been a subject in Japan.

The translated screenshots that srs_bro published came from Kyarychan.tumblr, which was inactive for years (I used to read it several times a week and the publications stopped in early 2017). And all its posts have been deleted by now, as well as its associated Twitter account. Which means the tumblr as has been deleted in the last 3 months.

If you want to dig in, you have to scroll Kyary's Twitter.(@pamyurin) [Her former blog](https://ameblo.jp/kyarypamyupamyu/?fbclid=IwAR2o_IaKbwNu6FByVMaeBB6Sol7R5Jxa6Uxqwhgk91wPJ_HosIrc9d-UCi8) has been deleted.

P-chan, who is twenty by now, regulary talks about Kyary on his instagram (p_tempurakidz) and, as far as I know, never came out about any kind of harasement from Kyary. Nor did her other former back dancers.

This is all I know by now. 

Of course, sexual harassment and paedophilia HAS to be taken seriously. 

But when the only evidence is based on a couple of translated screenshots from one anonymous user on Twitter, who's not even relative to P-chan or Kyary, it seems a bit inconsistent. 

So, to answer your primary question, those allegations are not the slightest of a subject in Japan. 
And srs_bro's accusations are not something we should base on."
1248,2020-03-29 16:30:17,fq26sk,"well the messages are definitely kinda weird but if nothing ever came of it i doubt there was actual malicious intent behind them or anything. but like you said, EVERY possible case of this kind of stuff should be taken serious.

1305,2020-04-21 15:23:26,g5ggyq,"It's all stupid lazy racism, but I'll attempt to explain why it's the default for stupid lazy racists.  

Statistically, most Asians are Chinese.  There are a LOT of people with Chinese ancestry.  

There was also a large Chinese immigration into the early Americas and Cantonese style restaurants were the first experience most people have with an Asian culture.  So ""Chinese"" is the first Asian ethnicity/nationality that comes to mind for most Americans.  

>I don't start calling every Caucasian person I see German

If you lived in the US, you could and you'd [probably be right](https://www.census.gov/content/census/en/newsroom/stories/2017/october/german-american/jcr:content/par/image.uscbimg.319.medium.jpg/1550276304430.jpg).  In many areas they used to teach schools in German until around WWI."
1306,2020-04-21 15:25:26,g5ggyq,"First off sorry for what you been through, but to answer the question I think it's because it's the largest country that the US has the most interaction with. It's similar to why if you're in the western United States people call all Latinos Mexican even if they're actually from Guatemala or Venezuela or somewhere else."
1307,2020-04-21 14:55:09,g5ggyq,"Lazy racism..... its not everyone but instead of learning about different cultures, they just group things together. I come from a lesser know arabic country but people just assume im greek LOL"
1308,2020-04-21 14:44:46,g5ggyq,Population density and social proliferation. Same reason white people are American by default.
1309,2020-04-21 15:29:32,g5ggyq,"Here in Argentina most people refer to all americans as yankies, every eastern asian as chinese, all spanish as ""gallegos"" and there are probably other examples out there.

No one asumes that these people are just chinese, it's just common in some cultures to refer to asians that way, and also, due to lack of contact with those other cultures, people think that all chinese people look the same. Someone once said to me something that stuck with me: to us every animal of the same race looks alike, but they see each other as different as we think we are from each other. I always applied the same logic to people with clear traits and characteristics that come from cultures that had little representation in my own.

The point is that, unless the person saying it is ill-intentioned, they mean no harm and its just the result of lack of education."
1310,2020-04-21 23:00:54,g5ggyq,"What's odd is I say that because a lot of my Indian friends hate to be called Asians. They know it all in the same region but they dislike it a lot but I know that doesn't speak for everyone. I have a Russian friend who was born in the Northern Asian region of Russia but he definitely doesn't consider himself Asian even if he was born in that area. I don't have much to say on Indians, pakistanis, etc so I can't really say much on them or what they dislike or like to be called except my personal few friends. I still don't assume every brown person is Indian though but unfortunately I know some Middle Eastern individuals that are called Indian by default on a daily basis."
1311,2020-04-21 23:03:47,g5ggyq,"True. It's just from what I have seen and what I have underwent. Especially online, I have seen Asians post pictures of themselves and people will use Chinese stereotypes even if they're not Chinese I.e. They eat dog, Ching chong, etc.

Surprisingly enough, after this post, my GFs Uncle that she has talked to after years, actually said I looked Korean. It was surprising to say the least so maybe the awareness might be getting better. At leastI hope so."
1312,2020-04-21 23:29:33,g5ggyq,"Very true. Thing is, I didn't know this but apparently Filipinos make up the second most of the Asian population in the US. According to the Wiki article I found

""This made Asian Americans 5.6 percent of the total American population. The largest ethnic groups represented in the census were Chinese (3.79 million), Filipino (3.41 million), Indian (3.18 million), Vietnamese (1.73 million), Korean (1.7 million), and Japanese (1.3 million).""

Filipinos aren't that far behind but I'm astonished that no one even says someone is Fillipino. Most people just automatically assume they're dark skinned Chinese people. 

It makes sense that this happens with the Chinese immigration. A comment stated this below but I noticed it as well, since Mexico is the closest to us and has the most immigration from there, most assume that Hispanic people are all Mexicans. I definitely know this pisses off people who are Puerto Rican or Venezuelan so it seems that people just associate the first thing they see or whatever they see from mainstream media. 

I'm still curious on why an Asian's race seems to be a huge deal for people. I get asked all the time what type of Asian I am. When I'm minding my own business at work or anywhere actually, someone will eventually ask or say some Asian stereotype like asking if I eat dogs (which I definitely don't lol). It sucks cause my asian friends (which I have a lot of) deal with racism on a daily basis from strangers even prior to the crisis. I remember an Asian female friend of mine had a group of high schoolers began slanting their eyes as they walked past her out of nowhere. A ton of my Asian friends talk about situations like this but not with my other ethnic friends and definitely not Caucasian people. My black friends have to deal with an entirely different set of racial tensions especially with cops but they never get ridiculed for race unless they're in a fight or it's online where people think they're tough cause it's behind a screen. Asians though, seem to be seen as weak so it's perfectly fine to make fun of them so thinking that Asian's are Chinese  definitely isn't a big deal whatsoever.

It's just an odd thing to think about race all the time. I was born in America but I think of everyone as people instead of thinking about their race all the time. Even when fighting with people I despise, I never make it to where I bring out racist comments but I have definitely had comments towards me. If you see a lot of Rap Battles VS any Asians, racial comments are pulled out every time. A Korean rapper named Dumbfoundead would get remarks about Chinese Kung fu movies regardless if the opposing rapper knows he's Korean or not. 

I'm hoping this becomes less prevalent but something tells me it will be a thing for a long time. Asian racism has always been seen as a less prevalent issue and I honestly have no idea why this is the case. Who knows though? Only time will tell, so maybe things will get better after this whole crisis or maybe it'll get worse. I mean a lot of minorities deal with increased racism after some sort of terrible event I.e. 9/11, Ebola, etc so minorities all deal with some sort of tension. (I don't believe this happens with caucasians, mostly because caucasians make up the most of the US population especially but I'm not white so I can't say.) anyways, sorryfpr the long text thread. I type fast so I just type anything that comes to mind lol."
1313,2020-04-21 23:34:38,g5ggyq,"Thank you! Also I know that a lot of my Hispanic friends deal with this as well. It especially infuriates my Venezuelan or Puerto Rican friends. It's a touchy subject for them especially. There are just racist people everywhere. I know during the first Trump election, I saw a lot of people become incredibly mean to Hispanic individuals and saying things like they hope the wall keeps all Mexicans out of the US where they belong. Hell, I just saw a YouTube video where two ladies were infuriated at a Burger King because the Manager was speaking Spanish to his family. It seems that people are just out of touch with reality."
1314,2020-04-21 23:31:29,g5ggyq,"Yeah, I know a lot of other groupings happen with a variety of different people. You'd think with the Internet, people would learn a lot more but on Social Media's like Facebook, I see a lot of people become incredibly toxic by saying X group is beneath them and they're unafraid even if it shows their actual face. It's scary to think people can be like this."
1315,2020-04-21 23:43:58,g5ggyq,"I can definitely excuse lack of education, but it stings when random people have called out racist things to me and my friends. I even had a worker at a fair start berating me for being Asian. Most people assume that we won't do anything. 

It took me off guard because this dude was a worker. I've had strangers say so many things to me for no reason but an actual working person was a first. Lack of education definitely doesn't excuse the douche behavior. 

With this whole Pandemic, every Asian is at risk since everyone thinks all Asians are Chinese. Every type of Asian business is failing badly right now and every Asian is deemed as sick and wearing a mask makes the backlash even worse. Other races are allowed to wear it but people fear when any Asian is wearing one. It's a bit jarring when going from some racist comments by couple strangers everyday to having the majority of people start saying dickish things. I'm lucky that I haven't been physically hurt yet like a Vietnamese friend of mine that went to go get a package at the post office and ended up getting beat by strangers who were wearing medical masks along with saying it was his fault they can't go outside. This event especially made me afraid to go get groceries to be honest. Now, my friend has his white roommate go get whatever they need. 

It's scary how grouping people together can exacerbate the hate even further (not that it's excusable to hate ANY culture or group to begin with)."
1316,2020-04-21 23:05:50,g5ggyq,"> a lot of my Indian friends hate to be called Asians

Interesting.  So what do they call themselves?

Interestingly in the UK, almost everyone there refers to South Asians (Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Sri Lankans, etc.) as ""Asians"".

>I have a Russian friend who was born in the Northern Asian region of Russia but he definitely doesn't consider himself Asian

But is he ethnically Russian?  Russia's such a massive country, and there are tons of ethnic Russians living in the far east of the country.  But that having been said, there are also tons of ""Asian looking"" folks in Russia who consider themselves ethnically Russian."
1317,2020-04-22 00:15:35,g5ggyq,"Sorry for the format, now I'm on mobile.

-

Let me just say that I, in no way, condone of that behavior. I was just pointing out that in some cultures it is pretty common to end up referring to someone by an incorrect term due to their lack of representation on the caller's culture. I know better, and avoid making people feel excluded or disrespected if I can.

-

As I said before, there is a difference between ill-intent and just plain ignorance. There are some that sadly sin of both, and those who know that you may not be chinese but still choose to disrespect you and take advantage of the situation to bully you.

-

I think that there is a lot of stupid evil people out there that just want to feel powerful, even if that has the consequence of making another one feel powerless.

-

I hope that you are safe and that no one has to go through what you and your friend are. We are living a shitty once in a lifetime event and there's no way around it. Let's just do our best to survive and hope that in the future people get the education they are missing."

This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

1384,2020-04-21 03:49:17,g57mum,"Well Justin Bieber was a worldwide phenomenon for at least a few years. But like there was a point where absolutely nobody hated him except for like elementary school boys (which I was one of). Then he went downhill when he started becoming controversial after pissing in that janitor‚Äôs bucket and all that ‚Äúbad boy‚Äù shit he did.

Plus, he had a HUGE brand alongside his name. Em never really had a product that he sold using his name like Dre with Beats and 50 with Vitamin Water or Kanye with Yeezys"

1387,2020-04-21 03:25:49,g57mum,Justin Bieber has/had a big ass brand along with his music. Eminem doesn‚Äôt really have that
1388,2020-04-21 03:38:13,g57mum,you should‚Äôve made a poll for this
1389,2020-04-21 04:53:44,g57mum,Money isn't measured by talent buddeh. Kim Kardashian is worth more than you will ever be.
1390,2020-04-21 04:38:22,g57mum,"Yeah, plus Bieber's rise to fame was different to Eminem's.

Bieber's became an ""overnight"" star and a few distinct differences between his music and Eminem's (other than some obvious stuff) are:

* His music is clean, like from the get-go, it has almost no (if any) swear words - meaning it doesn't need a censored version. This means it's instantly radio and TV (at least daytime TV) playable.  This matters because it also means it's appropriate for kids, and parents will buy into it.
* Bieber has that good looking boyish charm that young people like, and with his music being clean pop music, this made him desire able to young people. Eminem has his own charm, but it's different,  because he appealed to people because of his music, his style and his personal character.
* Until he recently started to treat his fans off, he was never under the public eye for negative reasons. He wasn't having his music looked at under the microscope, being protested against performing and being criticised because he said something offensive - something that we all know did happen to Eminem.
* (A similarity, not a difference) His career was backed by Usher, also a pop musician with a following, whose released some hits before. That level of financial, production in his professional music and industry connections won't go unnoticed. Eminem benefited from the same thing with DRE.

Plus, monetary value isn't everything. He may be richer than Eminem, but I think he definitely cares about his craft more than Bieber.

Edit: Forgot to add a point that I thought was important."
1391,2020-04-21 04:45:29,g57mum,He pissed in a janitors bucket? What a little prick!
1392,2020-04-21 05:15:57,g57mum,Okay? What‚Äôs the point of your senseless insult? No where in this post did I mention myself.
1393,2020-04-21 04:45:08,g57mum,Thanks!
1394,2020-04-21 05:03:35,g57mum,I'm sure Em had done much worse in his day lol.
1395,2020-04-21 05:24:54,g57mum,Not an insult. It's the truth. The same applies to all of us.
1396,2020-04-21 05:14:42,g57mum,Eminem would never disrespect the working man like that. He‚Äôs way too humble.
1397,2020-04-21 09:42:12,g57mum,"Don't you remember the time when Eminem ran to the janitor's storage booth; kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four inch screws and then grabbed some sharp objects, brooms, and foreign tools?"
1398,2020-04-21 05:21:23,g57mum,"Em was once a prick, Em admits to being a prick. You're lying to yourself if you think he didn't do some mad disrespectful shit in his day lmao."

1423,2020-04-21 00:36:44,g54afe,"Early/core millennials didn‚Äôt claim it, but when you think about it, the biggest artists of this era were Katy Perry, Lady Gaga and Kesha and they‚Äôre much more similar sonically to Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera than they are to Gen Z music. Justin Bieber was the Aaron Carter of that time. The whole sound and vibe of the electropop era is distinctly late millennial. What would become the zoomer sound didn‚Äôt start developing until the 2012-2013 school year, but even then it was still in its infancy until 2015 or so. Zoomers claim the electropop era because the early/core cohort were in elementary/middle school at the time. Most millennial were already in their late teens and 20s by the start of the era so they don‚Äôt view it as the music of their formative years. I find this to be the case with people born before 1991. I for one, graduated high school in 2012 and this musical era was the most defining period in my life and encompasses my coming of age years."
1424,2020-04-21 08:49:32,g54afe,"I don't see why not. Skrillex and dubstep were pretty big around that time and can definitely be counted as millenial.

Justin Bieber (my memory is a bit fuzzy on this because I was never into his music) was popular just as I was at the end of middle school and beginning HS. (Baby Baby came out in 2009 according to Google. Had to look it up. I think I might have been a little too old for his demographic in his hey days). Also part of me might have seen through that 'sparkly' and 'innocent' Disney friendly image back then. Around 2008-2009 I stepped away from Disney in general.

Kesha is definitely younger millenial. Blink is also millenial. They were fairly popular in my hometown. Same for Good Charlotte.

When I think of millenial music some things I think of: Tupac, Biggie, Nirvana, Maroon 5, Destiny's Child, The Weekend, Lil Wayne (I think that people sometimes forget he came out in the late 90s since a lot of his stuff was popular in the 2000s. Guilty to admit I did listen to his stuff) Britney Spears, Ariana Grande (not a fan of her stuff but I think she fits into late millenial/ Gen Z territory). I would have to say maybe any artist coming after her could count as the start of Gen Z. I'll admit I stopped following mainstream music around 2013 so I really can't comment on anyone after that."
1425,2020-04-21 22:32:45,g54afe,"I would consider it more gen z than millennial, but that doesn't mean there aren't millennials who love(d) it as well, especially younger millennials/cuspers. It's honestly probably both though."
1426,2020-04-21 22:33:26,g54afe,"Yeah I tend to think of it as music Zoomers are nostalgic for when they were young kids, even if the performers themselves are squarely Millennials"
1427,2020-04-21 02:12:25,g54afe,"It most definitely is Millennial music. Le Wrong generation types are a vocal minority on the internet. Currently, you'll find that Billie Eilish gets similar hate. Doesn't mean she isn't making iconic gen z music.

Lady Gaga was huge in the late 2000s/early 2010s. I don't think it was 8 year olds who were packing her concerts while she swallowed rosary beads and half naked men gyrated on stage."

1429,2020-04-21 09:08:43,g54afe,"Good points. I remember dubstep and similar genres being considered hipster. Dubstep was highly polarizing. It was pretty popular among high schoolers and college students. A lot of older generations hated it because it just sounded like random noise. I also graduated HS in 2012. 

Kpop also was popular. I remember watching Gangnam style in my school's Subway on a sunny early afternoon. I remember asking myself why they were planning a song in Korean at an American campus."
1430,2020-04-21 00:58:48,g54afe,"People try to attach themselves to earlier eras they either don‚Äôt remember experiencing or only vaguely so. I used to do this. I started elementary school in 1999 and used to claim the late 90s/early 2000s era as my childhood when in fact, although I did experience the very late 90s, I spent more childhood in the mid 2000s. I don‚Äôt even remember late 90s music for the most part. When I look at the Billboard Hot 100 by year, 2002 is the first year where I recognize most of the songs. Even the teen pop era of 1999-2001, I barely remember. I think it has to do with mid 90s babies feeling excluded from millennials while they were in their teen years."

1462,2020-04-20 19:02:59,g4vew2,"Any tips for anyone trying to get into production? I'm studying music right now, but I'm interested as to what you think should be things we need to be prepared for, or we should do to be able to be successful?"
1463,2020-04-20 22:21:42,g4vew2,Did you work with Nicki Minaj and if so how was it ?
1464,2020-04-20 23:32:13,g4vew2,"Have you ever worked with, or know someone who has, Dua Lipa or Martin Garrix? 

Thanks for doing this!"
1465,2020-04-20 19:26:51,g4vew2,Are you cool with Malay ? He made that Booty Club song with Frank Ocean and wanted to release his own solo album. Do you know what made him scrap that entire thing? He was THAT close to releasing the Frank collab. I thought maybe you were involved in some sessions.
1466,2020-04-20 18:07:26,g4vew2,What was it like to work with Travis and Mark and what project was it for?
1467,2020-04-21 01:23:38,g4vew2,[deleted]
1468,2020-04-20 20:25:17,g4vew2,"I love Allmusic! It's really interesting to see all the people you have worked with, it's really inspiring. On that, have any words of wisdom for anyone that likes to produce music? I like to do it for fun but I'm not really good at it, so I've never shared my music, is this a hurdle you found yourself wanting to get over when you just started? How does one get out of their head? Also, what artists inspired you to want to create something of your own?

Thank you for doing the AMA!"
1469,2020-04-21 03:00:38,g4vew2,"You went to school. There‚Äôs no ‚Äúworking‚Äù your way in. Either do it or don‚Äôt. Even when things have been slow and I‚Äôve been on the edge of making rent, I will never give up and I‚Äôll never do a side job. My side jobs are other audio jobs. So go for it if you wanna do it. Move to a city where it happens a lot and just do it. There‚Äôs gonna be six million reasons not to leap but the correct move is right in front of you, just fucking leap"
1470,2020-04-20 20:11:02,g4vew2,Where did you start out? I‚Äôd love to produce but the music industry is a tough nut to crack.
1471,2020-04-20 22:56:54,g4vew2,Producing music is a dream of mine. I've been making stuff in FL studio since that is what was most accessible to me. Should I get a different DAW if I want to be serious or am I okay? Do you recommend any resources for someone starting out?
1472,2020-04-21 02:17:17,g4vew2,"Have you ever worked with Lorde? If you have, what was it like?

If the answer to that question is no - you mentioned working with Jack Antonoff in another comment. He has worked with lots of women lately, and has produced some great work that seems to draw out such powerful emotion in women in particular. (There being very similar lines from Taylor Swift's Cruel Summer, Lorde's Liability, and Lana's Happiness is a butterfly - all those songs mention crying in the back of taxis specifically) From working with Jack and being in the presence of his general vibe, from your perspective as a fellow producer, how is he able to summon that vulnerability in his peers so easily?

Lastly, what is your favorite part about being a producer? 

This is so cool! Thank you for being here with us."
1473,2020-04-21 05:26:44,g4vew2,"Hi Wil, I've been reading all your replies. Thank you for this AMA, it's very interesting! I have one question, what was it like working with Frank Ocean when he was recording Pyramids specifically? I ask because that song is so epic and has come to be regarded as one of the most acclaimed songs of the past decade. I wonder what it was like being in the studio and hearing something monumental like that for the first time. Also I'm obligated to ask if you met John Mayer when he recorded his part or have met him otherwise and if so what it was like :)"
1474,2020-04-21 02:35:57,g4vew2,Have you ever worked with Nelly Furtado? If so do you know if she is gonna release another album that might be as successful as Loose?
1475,2020-04-21 05:09:41,g4vew2,So awesome to hear all this from a professional who is so open. You made some of Ariana's best songs too! Thanks for that and this Q&A! I wish I knew how to start making my own music when I already have some vision and lyrics.
1476,2020-04-20 20:11:07,g4vew2,"Hey thanks for this AMA! 
1) Are you giving artistic directions/advice while recording or it's not part of your job? 
2) Who owns the studio you work in? Do the singers rent it and your work at the same time, is it separate? How does that work??"
1477,2020-04-20 19:50:54,g4vew2,Awesome! Definitely going to follow you. I am trying to produce a second album on my own and am in over my head. Would you mind if I PM'd you for a tip or too?
1478,2020-04-20 22:00:18,g4vew2,"Hi! It‚Äôs really cool of you to do this! I have a couple of questions:

1) what was the most fun project you worked on (and who was it with)?

2) Who is the artist that‚Äôs popular now that you want to work with the most? 

Thanks for doing this, I‚Äôve had a great time reading all the responses you‚Äôve given to people!"
1479,2020-04-21 04:27:31,g4vew2,"Hi! Thank you for taking time to do this AMA! As an aspiring musician, is there one thing that you consider essential for investing time and money into? Also, is there any way you are accepting any internship opportunities? I'd love to take a look inside the industry from a professional standpoint. Thanks again!"
1480,2020-04-21 06:54:54,g4vew2,"Also, what is one artist that you haven't worked with yet but would like to?"
1481,2020-04-20 22:04:05,g4vew2,"Have you ever had the chance to work with an EDM producer, like Marshmello, Zedd, /u/the_chainsmokers or Diplo for instance? If so, how was your experience working in that genre compared to more pop-oriented stuff? Any stories?"
1482,2020-04-21 10:52:42,g4vew2,"Have you ever worked or met Paramore? If so, how were they?"
1483,2020-04-21 00:12:51,g4vew2,any tips for someone who wants to start making music on their own? I have a personal goal to just finish a song haha
1484,2020-04-21 02:21:27,g4vew2,"How do you get in contact with all these artists? Do you approach them, do they approach you or do the labels organise all this? Very curious because you‚Äôve got experience across a large variety of different artists and genres (like you said somewhere above, you‚Äôve done country, pop and even rap)!"
1485,2020-04-21 03:34:00,g4vew2,What was JAY Z like? That sounds so awesome ... did you by chance get to see/work with Beyonc√©/Rihanna/Kanye during that time as well or just Jay?
1486,2020-04-21 03:35:13,g4vew2,"Have you been in the studio with Kanye? If so, what was that like.."
1487,2020-04-21 03:57:59,g4vew2,"How involved are the artists with production/mixing, on average? I know some artists just knock out their parts in the studios and leave the rest to the engineers and producers, but it's interesting when they have more creative control over the technical aspects of their music."
1488,2020-04-21 04:31:37,g4vew2,"I am dying to know, how was it like working with Justin Bieber? Was he pretty good, was he annoying, was he nice? What songs did you work on and are you proud of the work you've done with him? Have you ever worked with Zayn or One Direction (or their members?)

Also how you got into engineering/production, like how do you continue to learn how to keep up with the current trends? I've always wanted to dabble in producing/engineering music as a hobby, and I was wondering what is a ""starter pack""? And do you take on mentees?"
1489,2020-04-21 06:46:53,g4vew2,What was working with Injury Reserve like?
1490,2020-04-20 18:19:21,g4vew2,Thank you for all the info and for taking the time out of your day to answer questions.  Have you worked with BTS?

1493,2020-04-20 22:22:01,g4vew2,"How hard is it for people in the industry to take song concepts from aspiring songwriters? Like, if a nobody wrote a song and was interested in someone recording it. Do you/would you do it?"

1495,2020-04-20 23:01:44,g4vew2,Is becoming a successful touring act as an artist all about having a huge social media following? Where is the line between music and online
1496,2020-04-20 23:13:27,g4vew2,"Have you ever had any interactions with Daft Punk? What have you heard about them?

Also, what‚Äôs your dream collaboration?"
1497,2020-04-21 02:24:23,g4vew2,"What advice would you give to someone producing in their bedroom (10+ years experience) looking to start breaking into writing/production of pop artists? What is the best route to take to get started? I‚Äôm not even quite sure where to start... 

Do I need an agent? Do I send my instrumental music to A&R teams hoping for any word back? Do I reach out to vocalists and release music for free just to get a start? I know most careers grow organically but feel like I‚Äôm shooting in the dark! 

A lot to unpack there, I‚Äôm sure... I‚Äôm just looking for any sort of direction I could head in. Thanks!"
1498,2020-04-21 02:53:07,g4vew2,Is Akon a nice person? He seems so cool. I love his music.

1. Have you worked with any of the following artists: Zara Larsson, Ellie Goulding, Halsey, or Bebe Rexha? And if so, what was it like working with them?

2. What was it like working with RHCP? I‚Äôm typically not into alt-rock, but I absolutely love them.

3. How did you get into production? I don‚Äôt know that much about it, but I kinda want to learn how to produce in the future.

Was also curious to hear some stories about justin timberlake!"
1504,2020-04-21 10:34:23,g4vew2,"You‚Äôre probably tired of questions but I‚Äôm really curious about one thing: How are indie pop/rock artists influencing the artists you‚Äôre working with / do they have any influence? Are they known, is what they do cared about in the bigger industry?

For example: Fiona Apple, St. Vincent, Perfume Genius, Weyes Blood, Japanese Breakfast

also these are my favorite artist so I know it‚Äôs a long shot but if you‚Äôve met or heard about any I‚Äôd love to hear about it :)"

Thank you so much for doing this AMA!"
1520,2020-04-20 16:44:57,g4vew2,"I'm so glad you asked this question. Please please please go listen to Eleanor K on Spotify. Full disclosure, she is my ex but I think she is the most talented musician that no one has heard of really. She used to be the singer of Crystal Fighters but she has started her own solo project. Its quite amazing."
1521,2020-04-20 16:18:27,g4vew2,"To be honest I don‚Äôt really remember anymore. She was such a young girl and at the time I had no idea that she was going to be the thing she became. I was engineering for this producer Matt Squier, so I‚Äôm sure if I googled I could figure it out. She was so wonderful tho. Extremely talented"
1522,2020-04-20 16:27:17,g4vew2,Frank was such an interesting experience. I started working with Frank before he was even Frank. When he first booked the time he was still Lonnie on the studio paperwork. We made Channel Orange and then he became this icon but I swear I knew the whole time he was gonna be something special. He had a vision from the minute he started.
1523,2020-04-20 17:29:12,g4vew2,"I don't know how she is now but when I worked with Ariana she was amazing. She showed up on time, sang her ass off and then went home. She was so talented and kind and didn't really need a lot of feedback because she just nailed it. She did however, sacrifice me to Nelly once but that's a whole different story."
1524,2020-04-20 19:09:14,g4vew2,"Oh man, this is the time to talk about ... fucking Nickelback. 

&#x200B;

I got a gig to work with Nickelback about 6 or 7 years ago. At first I was a bit apprehensive about it but I quickly embraced it and thought that it would be a good credit to have and a good discussion topic. Now, when I say I was apprehensive it wasn't because I don't like Nickelback but rather because I assumed they would be dick heads. A lot of times, being shitty goes along with being in a big band. So I agree to it and I get ready for the day to come. 

&#x200B;

The first day of the session comes and I am setting up the studio when a guy comes in with a bunch of drums. He introduces himself and because its Nickelback and typically a band like that has roadies and assistants and shit so I assume he's the drum tech. I start chatting him up and he's really cool. Super nice guy. As we're talking he says that he used to drum for 3 Doors Down and I start to realize that this guy is the drummer. The thing is, this dude is too fucking nice. I mean, he asks me if I'm hungry. In the music industry this is the equivalent of offering to buy your waiter a meal. It never fucking happens. So I'm thinking, well even if the music isn't cool, at least this drummer is dope. I could spend a week making music with this dude, no problem. 

&#x200B;

One by one, the rest of the band shows up. Each one is nicer than the last.  I swear to everything, the band was the nicest group of fucking people I have EVER worked with. They are all Canadians and they are so polite and considerate of everyone around them. So I'm thinking ok, Chad is the only one not here. I've seen this before, the band is super fucking cool but then the lead singer shows up and the vibe completely changes because he's such a domineering asshole. So finally, Chad shows up. He comes in the room and he starts talking to me. He asks me my name, then he does something that so rarely happens to me I must've been visibly shocked when he did. He asked me my last name. Then, he complimented my last name. My last name is German so sometimes people think its weird, but Chad started complimenting me on how strong it sounded and how I should be proud to be German. Not on some White Power Nazi shit or anything, just like, ""you seem like a good dude and you should be proud of your heritage."" We walk into the control room where the rest of the band is and he's like ""hey did you guys meet Wil? "" and starts raving to the room how happy they are to have me there. I seriously felt amazing that week. It was around the Stanley Cup time frame so the guys were just drinking and having a good time. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TL;DR 

 Nickelback are the nicest fucking people you will ever meet."
1525,2020-04-20 18:11:45,g4vew2,Yes I can. It is in fact what I do. Send me links and stuff
1526,2020-04-20 16:54:39,g4vew2,I would die to work with the Beatles. I met Geoff Emerick a few times before he died and I am so so jealous of his experience. Id also love to work with Fleetwood Mac during the Rumors days because I specialize in working with bands that are a fucking mess. A lot of people think about engineers as mixers but I am more of a tracking engineer and my gig is to be in the room with the band while the record is being recorded. I am a pro at being incredibly high and still extremely functional.
1527,2020-04-20 16:34:10,g4vew2,and what artist has been your favorite to work with so far
1528,2020-04-20 18:54:05,g4vew2,I haven't worked with him but I've run into him a few times. He's a cool dude. A lot of musicians these days are just really normal people who just happened to make it.
1529,2020-04-20 17:16:53,g4vew2,I was a Marine for 5 years after high school and when I got out I was so ready to do something for myself. I spent a few years playing in bands and touring and eventually I found myself with a choice. I could take a big chance and go for a career in music or I could go a safe route. So I bit the bullet and went to engineering school. I worked my ass off for a year in school and then I got a really good internship at a great studio called EastWest and the rest is history.
1530,2020-04-20 17:26:02,g4vew2,I don't have a lot of bad experiences if I'm honest. I love my job and Im really good at it so I tend to have overwhelmingly positive experiences. Even when people suck there's usually some redeeming factors to the session. I didn't like Travis Scott's attitude towards me but ya never really know what's going on with someone when you meet them. Maybe he's a really nice guy but he's just fucked up that day. I worked with Dej Loaf right before the Blip started and she was cool with me but then about halfway thru the session we kind of lost communication skills and it didnt go very well but that was the first time that happened in years.
1531,2020-04-20 20:36:18,g4vew2,"Taylor is one of the few artists I have had no contact with. I‚Äôve never met her, never been in the same place as her and don‚Äôt know anyone who knows her. It‚Äôs weird. Usually I at least know who she works but the closest I ever got to her was either working with Ryan Tedder or Jack Antonof. 

Pharrell is dope. He‚Äôs the reason they call me GreazyWil. He is so talented and also is really good at giving people life advice. He‚Äôs a very emotionally spiritual person"
1532,2020-04-20 18:33:07,g4vew2,Actually those are all people I haven‚Äôt had any experience with. If any one else knows CRJ put in a good word for me!
1533,2020-04-20 16:28:44,g4vew2,More recent. I only worked with him for a few days on Astroworld. He‚Äôs kind of a dick and treated me pretty shitty for no reason. The rap world is typically pretty shitty to work in. There‚Äôs a lot of chips on shoulders in that genre
1534,2020-04-20 16:37:29,g4vew2,"Justin Bieber was pretty young when I worked with him. It was interesting. I met a lot of great people on that session. I‚Äôve worked with Justin (Timberlake) multiple times. I was the engineer for the 20/20 experience string dates and I also helped on the score for a movie he scored. He also hired me to engineer a band he was producing called The Shadowboxers. He‚Äôs a really cool dude but kind of dorky too. I really enjoy working with him but you have to be in top 1% to work for him. He expects a lot from his people but also gives them a lot of faith when you prove yourself


edit: clarification"
1535,2020-04-20 17:31:13,g4vew2,"I answered this a little in a different response but I went to engineering school for 9 months and then I got an internship at a really big studio. If I'm honest its not getting here that is the hard part, its staying here. Ive put in thousands and thousands of hours of work to be a part of this industry and especially right now, its an extremely difficult and unforgiving industry."
1536,2020-04-20 17:38:45,g4vew2,I like those guys. I worked with them a bunch because I was Alex Da Kid‚Äôs engineer for a while. I also worked with the x ambassadors for a while too. They‚Äôre all cool guys. I don‚Äôt know any secrets about them I don‚Äôt think. They‚Äôre just pretty normal people.
1537,2020-04-20 20:11:46,g4vew2,That was actually amazing. I got to record Jemaine and he was so funny. I will never forget him singing the Tomatoa parts and he killed it. The producers had him try a more Bowie approach and he nailed Bowie so hard. It was funny
1538,2020-04-20 20:57:54,g4vew2,"Uh, he‚Äôs a cool dude. A bit weird or whatever but really smart and really cool. We just wrote a song together one day and that was it."
1539,2020-04-20 16:51:51,g4vew2,"RHCP was my intro into the audio world so I was so nervous around them. Flea was super cool. He would always hang out in the kitchen and bullshit with me in the morning. Josh, was really friendly with all the staff. Anthony tried to hit me with his car. Im not sure about that guy"
1540,2020-04-20 20:10:07,g4vew2,"Well, to start, you have to be in a major city to be an engineer for big stuff. There‚Äôs no minor leagues for recording. You either go all in or not. I just googled Los Angeles studios and found the one I liked the most and then did everything I could to make a reality. I know that sounds like an oversimplification of it but really. You just think you can do something and then you do it."
1541,2020-04-20 18:44:34,g4vew2,Ludwig is so funny. Ive worked with him a lot. he has such a dry sense of humor and he's Swedish so that makes you incapable of telling whether he is dead panning at the time or not. He's a brilliant human being. He has an intellect for music that very few people in the industry have
1542,2020-04-20 21:50:13,g4vew2,he said Travis was the worst
1543,2020-04-20 20:14:50,g4vew2,"Johan Lenox is insanely talented. His musical skills are beyond 99% of the industry. He does strings for Kanye and Teyana Taylor and Mike Dean but he also has his own project that's really cool. He's a good friend and we've worked together a lot and he really knows his shit. I also think my Ex, Eleanor K is up there. I prolly sound like an ad for her most of the time but I really think she is so talented. Ive always believed in her because she is so brilliant"
1544,2020-04-20 20:24:09,g4vew2,"I think so. Its a huge factor to live close to resources and good engineers. Honestly, I get for saying shit like this on the internet but in most cases, you will not find the level of skill in smaller towns as you will in bigger cities. In LA, an engineer as good as me is around every corner. And I consider myself really good. Its just there's a lot of us here. So if you wanna make a good record you're gonna need to do it where the good engineers are"
1545,2020-04-20 19:13:23,g4vew2,Just do it. Thats all there is to it. The best experience you can ever get is to just be doing it. You learn from people and putting your work out there. There's no formula any more so anyone can succeed. Just do what you want to do and believe in it more than anyone else.
1546,2020-04-21 00:49:18,g4vew2,Perched
1547,2020-04-21 00:47:36,g4vew2,We were supposed to tour with Dua last year in the Uk but my dumb ass let Vic Mensa borrow my motorcycle and he wrecked it and hurt his leg and had to back out. One of my biggest regrets of last year
1548,2020-04-20 19:30:25,g4vew2,I worked with Malay back in the CO days but not really since. I've seen him a few times since because he has a studio at a place I work a lot but I don't think he remembers me or something because we pass each other and don't really acknowledge each other. Music industry is weird sometimes.
1549,2020-04-20 18:11:01,g4vew2,"I worked with Travis on a bunch of stuff. He has a really great engineer named Matt but anytime Matt can‚Äôt be there he‚Äôll hit me to fill in. I worked on the Suicide Boys record he did and a bunch of Trippie Redd and MGK projects. Travis is seriously a really nice guy. He knows how far he‚Äôs come in life and treats people properly.

I know less about Mark cuz I‚Äôve only worked with him a few times but he‚Äôs also really cool. With Mark we were recording a song for one of his musician friends in some band. Not sure which one but I went to his crib in Beverly Hills and we worked with Lil Aaron. It was a lot of fun."
1550,2020-04-21 02:49:45,g4vew2,Depends on the artist. I think that sometimes it‚Äôs intentional leaks and sometimes it‚Äôs accidental. I‚Äôve never had anything leak that I worked on. You will never find a frank Ocean leak cuz he doesn‚Äôt let anyone else touch the drive except to put it on the computer
1551,2020-04-20 20:29:40,g4vew2,"Actually, it‚Äôs funny you say that because I have just started my own project. The reason I did this ama was to build some karma for posting my music on. I‚Äôve worked on some of the best musicians projects for the last 10 years and because I felt like I couldn‚Äôt keep up with those artists I thought I was trash. I listened to Frank Ocean and said ‚Äúwell I can‚Äôt make this so I shouldn‚Äôt make anything.‚Äù But the reality is that‚Äôs a once in a lifetime type of artist. Just because I‚Äôm not that doesn‚Äôt mean I shouldn‚Äôt make music. Because somewhere out is someone who fucking loves Tibetan throat singing. And they don‚Äôt give a shit about Channel Orange. Not that I make Tibetan throat singing music but my point is that there is a song for everyone"
1552,2020-04-21 00:46:33,g4vew2,Lots of pros use FL Studio. It doesn‚Äôt mean just because you use one DAW that you can‚Äôt use others too. Let FL be your main thing and then learn something else
1553,2020-04-21 02:44:17,g4vew2,"I haven‚Äôt worked with lorde but I do see her from the artist cage at Coachella whenever that was. She was alright! 

I think Jack has a really great musical sensibility and also is not a very assuming male. A lot men in the industry, especially in the rap world, are extremly macho. Jack is pretty chill. I mean he was wearing a trench coat when I met him. Not very intimidating unless you‚Äôre Lorenzo Lamas"
1554,2020-04-21 05:34:30,g4vew2,"Oh right, and John Mayer. I didn‚Äôt meet John then, but a year or two later he came to the studio one night when we were working on Blonde. Frank didn‚Äôt say who it was, he just said his homie John was at the front and could I go get him. So I fucking walk up there thinking this is gonna be just some dude and I open the door and it‚Äôs John Mayer. The best part is he comes in and introduces himself. ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm John.‚Äù Yeah dude I know the fuck you are. You‚Äôre a legend bro. I took him back to the studio and he asked if I had any guitars and all I had was my shitty fender strat and a zak Wylde distortion pedal. I brought to him and was like ‚Äúsorry dude. This is what I got‚Äù 

He proceeded to slay his parts. Made my shitty guitar sound amazing. I think what he did made the album but I don‚Äôt remember"
1555,2020-04-21 05:30:47,g4vew2,Uh. To be honest I don‚Äôt really remember when pyramids was made. I think it was part of the stuff that he worked on at a different studio that I didn‚Äôt really see. It just existed one day. Sometimes when you work with an artist that happens. They just appear with a nearly finished song that they pulled out of their ass. I do remember the first time I heard it was when I knew he was gonna be special. It was so different and interesting that I just wanted to hear it on repeat.
1556,2020-04-21 02:37:14,g4vew2,Fuck I wish. I worked with the J5 guys tho. Didn‚Äôt they do a song together
1557,2020-04-21 05:12:19,g4vew2,"These days it‚Äôs really easy to start. YouTube has lots of tutorials on almost anything you can imagine. Get logic. It‚Äôs like 200 dollars. You‚Äôll have a great place to start. Jesse, from The Neighborhood, has an entire album called GarageB& that he made on his iPhone with a free software. Go for it! Lots of people with no musical skills are making music these days"
1558,2020-04-20 20:21:00,g4vew2,"Most of the time I do give advice because I am comfortable doing it and I think Im fairly good at music so I am not afraid to throw out advice if the artist seems receptive. Reading the room is pretty essential. Knowing who wants your advice and who wants you to just press record and shut up is a tough skill to learn but one that's essential to being a good engineer. 

Usually the artist rents the studio and myself separately but it can come as a package deal as well. Everything is negotiable in this world. Sometimes I work at artist's houses instead of at the studio. I would bet in the future that happens even more."
1559,2020-04-20 19:52:52,g4vew2,"sure go ahead. I give great advice, which is exactly what a person who gives bad advice would say"
1560,2020-04-21 04:53:42,g4vew2,"I don‚Äôt really take interns often just because I don‚Äôt wanna waste anyone‚Äôs time. Most of the stuff I do, I show up solo. Bringing someone else would be disrespectful and a bit pompous. But I do occasionally take an intern or two. My last intern is now working for Manny Marroquin. I helped him get a job there when he finished his internship. 

As far as essential, I highly recommend cracking plug ins, stealing anything you can, and making due with pawn shop gear and whatever you have. The only time you should spend money on things is when you completely understand the difference it makes in your process. Don‚Äôt buy an expensive mic pre. Buy a shitty one and use it until you know exactly what it is that you hate about it and gets getting a better one would fix."
1561,2020-04-21 07:02:04,g4vew2,Hmm. Billy Eilish would be dope. I think I could add positively to her music. She‚Äôs really interesting
1562,2020-04-20 22:09:15,g4vew2,I worked with Diplo on Justin Bieber‚Äôs Believe album and I recorded a bunch of stuff for Skrillex‚Äôs recess album. They‚Äôre both cool dudes and have very different skill sets. Skrillex amazes me with how good he is at ableton. Like he‚Äôs a wizard. Diplo is more of an idea guy than a creator guy but he still has a lot of creative ideas too
1563,2020-04-20 22:10:38,g4vew2,Oh right and I drove the chain smokers to tender greens in my car once. I didn‚Äôt really know who they were. We were working together and they wanted to get some food and I said let‚Äôs go to tender greens and we all piled into my Honda Civic and drove to get lunch
1564,2020-04-21 20:50:44,g4vew2,Nope!
1565,2020-04-21 02:53:20,g4vew2,Just do it. You will be seeing me back here next week when I start releasing my own music. I‚Äôve been making music with everyone under the sun for the last ten years and I can‚Äôt wait to just do my own project for a little.
1566,2020-04-21 02:42:19,g4vew2,"Yeah I do everything. I‚Äôm one of the more versatile guys in the industry. You can call me for anything. I even recorded a lot of the vocals for the greatest showman and almost all the songs for the new spongebob movie. I have a lot of different sources for my work. Some people reach out directly, like Travis Barker did. I didn‚Äôt even know I was interviewing for a job with zack de la Rocha until about 2 hours into working with him. Juan Alderete (Mars Volta) introduced us by asking me to meet him at an address that I only found out was his when he opened the door. Sometimes labels contact me and set up sessions. It‚Äôs nearly entirely word of mouth. I go years without updating my website. I don‚Äôt even have a card or anything. If you‚Äôre looking for me you just google GreazyWil and you‚Äôll find find me. But truthfully, I often don‚Äôt know the people when they hire me and I have to google them to find out who *they* are. I mean, there‚Äôs a lot of fucking artists out there"
1567,2020-04-21 03:46:06,g4vew2,"I‚Äôve worked on songs for Rihanna but never worked with her. JayZ is a legend for a reason. He doesn‚Äôt lose his cool, he gives great advice and he stays in his own lane. You won‚Äôt catch him telling someone else how to live their life, only subtle suggestions and intelligent anecdotes that make you leave a conversation feeling Like you came up with idea but knowing damn well that was HOV‚Äôs plan the whole time."
1568,2020-04-21 03:44:13,g4vew2,Yeah Kanye is a trip. He‚Äôs a genius. Or a insane person. They may not be mutually exclusive.
1569,2020-04-21 04:02:37,g4vew2,"Yeah it‚Äôs all very different. On the HHH thread with Johan Lenox the other day he talked about how Vic Mensa does a lot of his own engineering which is very true. He‚Äôs impatient and he finds that he can‚Äôt explain something as fast as he can just do it. Vic is like my brother so I know how to deal with him by helping when he needs it and staying out of his way when he doesn‚Äôt. Ariana Grande basically comes in the studio, sings the parts and walks right back out the studio. She doesn‚Äôt waste any time thinking about the production or the lyrics really. She‚Äôs got people that do that. She might say, ‚Äúlet‚Äôs make this chorus big‚Äù or whatever but that‚Äôs about the extent of her participation in that. That‚Äôs not to say she isn‚Äôt talented, actually quite the opposite. She‚Äôs prolly one of the best singers in the music industry."
1570,2020-04-21 06:50:40,g4vew2,Those guys are dope. I‚Äôve known them for a long time and I really fuck with them. Their manager is Vic Mensa‚Äôs old assistant so I‚Äôve spent a lot of time with them. We even did a little mini tour one time.
1571,2020-04-20 18:21:09,g4vew2,I haven‚Äôt worked with BTS but last year I flew to Korea and worked with Jay Park and went to his festival. It was a pretty crazy experience because it was last minute but we were like ‚Äúfuck it let‚Äôs go‚Äù
1572,2020-04-21 04:35:35,g4vew2,"Run The Jewels have done this, check out Meow the Jewels."
1573,2020-04-20 19:21:20,g4vew2,"Yeah I don't think what we worked on was ever released so I don't really know but that was the time frame. To be honest we worked for like 2 weeks and only finished like 2 songs or something. He was taking a lot of meetings and shit while he is in the studio cuz he's a multi tasker like that. One interesting thing, a trans person came with him to the studio as part of his crew or whatever and I thought that was super interesting because the hip hop world is usually pretty weird about that type of stuff but he definitely wasn't a biased person at all and I was pretty stoked to see that."
1574,2020-04-21 02:57:23,g4vew2,"I guess ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Hell man I don‚Äôt really have any idea if I‚Äôm honest. I‚Äôve seen amazing talent fail and shit talent succeed. Who knows what it takes. Blind luck, connections and money I guess"
1575,2020-04-21 02:56:24,g4vew2,No but I‚Äôve met their Mixer Mick a few times. Really nice guy. I already have done my dream collab but you‚Äôll have to wait to hear it. I‚Äôll make a note to let you know when it comes out.
1576,2020-04-21 02:36:23,g4vew2,"All the business stuff will show up if you just make good music and try to work with good artists. You can‚Äôt expect to just start working with JayZ tomorrow if you‚Äôve never done anything significant. It happens occasionally where a nobody just shows up and kills it but usually you gotta grow to there. So work with nobody‚Äôs, weed out the shitty ones, help the ones that could maybe make it the best you can and try to do your best work. And take big risks. You have absolutely nothing to lose if you live at home with your parents. My apartment is $2500 a month and if I don‚Äôt have rent, that‚Äôs it, the dreams over. So why am I taking bigger risks than you? You should be shooting for the moon every day"
1577,2020-04-21 02:58:06,g4vew2,Yeah he‚Äôs really nice. Dude built like a whole country in Africa.
1578,2020-04-21 03:27:49,g4vew2,"I can‚Äôt really speak to what not to do. What works for some people doesnt work for others. I literally made my entire career out of making mistakes. I always do the wrong thing first, so much so that I almost have doubts sometimes cuz I‚Äôm not sure if I should just pick the exact opposite thing because of my history with bad decisions. So I don‚Äôt know bro, get a tik tok or something"
1579,2020-04-21 03:43:24,g4vew2,"I have not worked with any off them but my friend Josh, who is Bieber‚Äôs engineer works with all of them I think. 


I should clarify that I didn‚Äôt really work with RHCP. Like I helped out on the session but I was the assistants assistant. That sometimes happens on sessions where they bring a green guy on to help the experienced assistant do his job better. Ben O‚ÄôNeill who is a very dope engineer carried the lion‚Äôs share of responsibility. The guys were really cool mostly. We saw Josh and Flea the most but Anthony and Chad both made appearances. That was the first session I ever saw happen and I was so shocked at how much time and money they spent on a record. They were in multiple studios to the tune of 4-6k a day each for 7 months. That‚Äôs crazy. 

Production was actually the last part of all this. I‚Äôve been a musician my whole life mostly and I‚Äôve always been obsessed with music so after I knew everything that was going on I realized that my opinion is actually valid and people like what I say and do, sometimes anyway. So I just started doing more things. Someone would say, yo we need keys on this, so I would do it. We need guitar on this. Done. Just whatever someone needed I kept being able to do so I did."
1580,2020-04-21 03:54:13,g4vew2,"I‚Äôve answered this a few times already and I hate to repeat myself so I tried to vary the answer each time so if someone reads this and is like ‚Äúthis jackass gives different advice every time‚Äù just know it‚Äôs intentional. 


For you, I‚Äôd say, focus on a thing at a time. Learning and doing all those things at once is a huge task so don‚Äôt think you have to be the best at all of them. Learn everything well enough to figure out if you have the potential to be good at it or not. If you aren‚Äôt good at something, then decide if you can get good at it and if you don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs your skill set then maybe find people to trade skills with. Sometimes I have people mix for me even though I can mix very well because I feel like I‚Äôm too close to a project to see it‚Äôs flaws."
1581,2020-04-21 05:18:24,g4vew2,"The Hu? Is that the Mongolian rock band that Reddit loves? I hope it is, that‚Äôs pretty crazy. A lot of people are sending me stuff right now so it might behoove you to wait until like, next week and hit me on Instagram. You don‚Äôt have to do the whole ‚Äúhey man I talked to you on Reddit and you said to hit you‚Äù thing. Just say hi! I have a horrible memory so I will just have to assume you know me and I just forgot who you are. I promise if you pretend to know me I‚Äôll just go along with it."
1582,2020-04-21 20:53:47,g4vew2,It‚Äôs funny you ask that. I was working on a session with Ryan Tedder once and he was writing songs for U2 and they were referencing Haim. So I guess a lot of influence! I met Fiona Apple once at the studio. She was kinda odd but super dope.
1583,2020-04-21 20:51:18,g4vew2,I‚Äôve been on sessions where he was but we never met personally. He seems cool tho.
1584,2020-04-21 00:50:46,g4vew2,Two weeks ago Brendan Buckley and I did drums for an artist named JJ Lin. Haven‚Äôt had any long term or big projects since the blip
1585,2020-04-21 02:46:36,g4vew2,"Justin interesting. It was around the Believe album so he was just turning 18 I think. Maybe 21 I don‚Äôt remember. But he was nice but he definitely had a ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to be cool attitude about him, which at the time I immediately chalked up to him just being a bit young. I do remember her always had his hand down his pants and I was like, ‚Äúgot damn kid just found his dick 8 minutes ago, no wonder he‚Äôs keeping a hold of it.‚Äù I still stay in some contact with his engineer, who is also a fellow Marine that served in Iraq as well."
1586,2020-04-21 03:22:59,g4vew2,"Yeah, me personally. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm very good at writing melodies or not but what I do is the first pass I do is just me figuring out what‚Äôs in key and trying out ideas. Most of it is complete gibberish but I start filling words into spaces to find out what fits and what I like. Then after a few passes of gibberish I comp together the best stuff melody wise and start writing full on lyrics. Some people, like my ex, will write an entire song in their head before they even put any music together. I am not that good lol"
1587,2020-04-21 20:50:05,g4vew2,"Everything Frank does is from his mind. Justin Timberlake is pretty involved. Justin Bieber has input but he has a producer, a writer and a vocal producer on all his sessions so he may be involved but he‚Äôs being fed the answers, he just has to repeat it back"
1588,2020-04-21 20:48:15,g4vew2,I‚Äôve already gotten all my dream gigs so now I just wanna be a part of something cool. I don‚Äôt care who it is
1589,2020-04-21 20:22:22,g4vew2,Every day is different. It depends the most if I‚Äôm on a project with someone or not. Sometimes I work on an album for months at a time and then sometimes I got months without a big project. When I‚Äôm without a big project I scrounge up work wherever I can find it. Those days can end up being anything. I try to stay productive but sometimes I just lay around al day not doing shit
1590,2020-04-21 19:42:20,g4vew2,I worked on their whole first album but Sam really does most of the producing and recording himself so it was more of a technical aspect. They used my guitar and bass on the whole album. I guess my instruments are more famous than I am

Which songs are about you?"
1592,2020-04-20 17:52:54,g4vew2,Thank you for the gold! I will absolutely check her out!
1593,2020-04-20 20:12:49,g4vew2,Does she have a Deezer too? I couldn't find her on Deezer.
1594,2020-04-21 08:31:04,g4vew2,I love Crystal Fighters!! Cave Rave and Star i‚Äôd Love are such unique albums
1595,2020-04-20 21:27:19,g4vew2,"I looked it up, for anyone wondering. 

Based in Squire's credits on *Yours Truly*, the songs you worked on were Honeymoon Avenue, Tattooed Heart, and Daydreamin

Those are like three of her best songs, thank you so much!"

1599,2020-04-20 19:49:44,g4vew2,"This was a great story! Thank you so much for sharing! 


> he asks me if I'm hungry. In the music industry this is the equivalent of offering to buy your waiter a meal. It never fucking happens.


???? This part caught me off guard. I did not expect offerings to eat something to happen so infrequently, damn. Do y'all at least get a lil' break or something to eat? Or is this one of those jobs where you just work straight through breaks? 


Besides Jay-Z as you've mentioned already in this thread, which other artists have asked if you're hungry/asked if you're down for food?"
1600,2020-04-21 03:22:56,g4vew2,"I met Nickelback when I was interning at an entertainment studio 6 or so years ago, and HARD agree!

Out of all of the celebrities who passed through there, they were the only ones to all come up to me and introduce themselves, ask me my name, walk through the offices to say hi to the staff, and treat the interns like we weren't invisible. Chad had even opted to take a picture of me and the show's host on his phone (can't remember why tbh, but was nice) and offer to send it.

I was on camera duty that day and it was by far one of the most fun days during my time there. They definitely don't deserve the memeish hate they get."
1601,2020-04-21 05:48:27,g4vew2,"This actually makes me feel really bad for them. Super nice guys don‚Äôt deserve the flack they get.

1604,2020-04-20 17:00:00,g4vew2,"My favorite artists to work for are the ones who have good attitudes and act like this job is a privilege because it fucking is. Making music for a living is everything you would imagine it to be and if you're a dick while you do it, it just sucks ass. Travis Barker and Zack De La Rocha are the two artists I love the most because they are so chill and relaxed. They know they made it being artists and they just don't act like it made them any different."

1620,2020-04-21 04:45:27,g4vew2,"Travis wasn‚Äôt the worst, he‚Äôs just an example of one of the bad ones. I‚Äôm usually pretty understanding of people having a bad day or whatever. I forget pretty quick if someone was shitty to me. For example, one night I showed up at Travis Barker‚Äôs studio for a last minute call and I got there and we‚Äôre working with MGK. At first, he‚Äôs super shitty towards me. Snapping at me every time something isn‚Äôt how he likes it, which is obviously impossible for me to know. There‚Äôs a lot of ways to skin the cat in this industry so it‚Äôs easy to not know someone‚Äôs preferences. So I notice he‚Äôs a bit shitty towards me and there‚Äôs two directions I can go. I was a Marine and I fought in Iraq so I‚Äôm not scared of getting tough back with an artist. But I could tell MGK wasn‚Äôt gonna respond well to that. So I just started apologizing for everything that he complained about. If he said the vocals were too loud I‚Äôd be all ‚Äúhey man, sorry about that. I‚Äôll turn them down. Is there anything else that‚Äôs not how you like it?‚Äù And just kept being polite about it and instead of being defensive, just taking the blame. By the end of the session we were actually friendly and the whole attitude stopped towards me. He actually came back in the studio after he left to make sure he said goodbye and thanked me for the help. I think that it can be really frustrating as an artist because sometimes it‚Äôs really hard to describe what you want from people who work for you because you personally don‚Äôt have the vocabulary or knowledge for it. So patience is a virtue and all that"
1621,2020-04-21 00:58:37,g4vew2,"F's to pay respects for your motorcycle. 

Did you get to know her though? How is she like?"
1622,2020-04-21 02:59:46,g4vew2,Thank you!
1623,2020-04-21 05:20:16,g4vew2,"Thanks. You do have a point in searching through the Internet. I think the biggest problem for me would be a mental barrier and the fear of being hated. 

But at the end of the day, music is my life and it'd dumb not to try, especially when I have so much on my mind lately. Thanks again :)"
1624,2020-04-21 05:07:30,g4vew2,"Thank you so much for your response! I'm planning to move to LA eventually to really focus on music, and this is substantial advice. And the disrespectful bit is completely understandable. I'd still love to be able to work with you someday in the near future for anything really, and thank you again for your time and response!"
1625,2020-04-21 08:08:32,g4vew2,"I love her and FINNEAS‚Äô work! Now have you ever worked with the alternative hip hop genre, like BROCKHAMPTON for example?"
1626,2020-04-21 04:09:16,g4vew2,That sounds exactly like I picture him ... it‚Äôs good to know there‚Äôs some truth to his image!
1627,2020-04-21 03:55:43,g4vew2,Damnnn haha thats cool. What songs if you still remember that you produced with him there?
1628,2020-04-21 04:33:54,g4vew2,"That's cool about Vic. Kinda reminds me of someone like Prince who was so particular about his own sound and vision that he preferred to engineer on his own whenever possible, for the sake of efficiency.

and yeah, there's nothing wrong with leaving the whole thing up to the producers and engineers. It takes some level of trust and humility to do that, unless the singer is just completely apathetic lol"
1629,2020-04-21 17:06:41,g4vew2,I mean this was back in your Truly? Who knows how she's doing it now
1630,2020-04-21 07:21:21,g4vew2,"Damn, that's cool. Thanks for the reply!"
1631,2020-04-21 02:29:27,g4vew2,"this may be a little late, but how was working with jay park like? i‚Äôm pretty curious because it seems like he has a lot of personas."
1632,2020-04-20 18:25:05,g4vew2,Thanks for info. :)
1633,2020-04-21 05:14:59,g4vew2,Yeah I know im trying to get inspiration from it
1634,2020-04-21 00:00:30,g4vew2,">Yeah I don't think what we worked on was ever released so I don't really know but that was the time frame. To be honest we worked for like 2 weeks and only finished like 2 songs or something. He was taking a lot of meetings and shit while he is in the studio cuz he's a multi tasker like that. One interesting thing, a trans person came with him to the studio as part of his crew or whatever and I thought that was super interesting because the hip hop world is usually pretty weird about that type of stuff but he definitely wasn't a biased person at all and I was pretty stoked to see that.

Was it Jeffree Star - who is not trans but androgynous? I know they worked together for a while"
1635,2020-04-21 13:15:56,g4vew2,Wonderful please let me know!
1636,2020-04-21 02:58:28,g4vew2,"Thanks for the very honest response! I love that.

How did you get your start? What steps did you take in the beginning? What advice would you give your younger self when looking back at the start of your career?

Haha and I do have rent and work a 9-5, yet am really hoping to get started working with artists. I definitely expect to start at the bottom and for it to build over time. Definitely no Dunning-Kruger type delusions of grandeur here!  It‚Äôs almost the opposite..."
1637,2020-04-22 08:48:07,g4vew2,"Oh that‚Äôs interesting to hear! And Fiona Apple‚Äôs music is also just a perfect fit for that description, love it. Thank you for the answer!"
1638,2020-04-21 04:11:24,g4vew2,[deleted]
1639,2020-04-21 21:00:15,g4vew2,"Thanks for answering! have you got like a specific genre or sound aesthetic you want to work with?

also how did you get into the industry?"
1640,2020-04-20 21:32:38,g4vew2,I‚Äôm guessing all the ones that sound like the guy is the worst. So all of them
1641,2020-04-20 20:16:16,g4vew2,I don't even know what that is. I think she's just on Spotify and Apple Music. She used to have a Soundcloud under the name Kyiki but she no longer is doing that. She just has Eleanor K now
1642,2020-04-20 21:34:35,g4vew2,"Honeymoon avenue sounds familiar for sure. Honestly, I know this sounds a bit ridiculous but I forget a huge amount of the stuff I work on. At that point in my life I was doing hundreds of sessions a year. I was working on so much music that sometimes I hear songs on the radio that I know all the words to and don‚Äôt even know how I know the words.


Edit: I want to add something here as an aside. It is fucking really really shitty that engineers and assistants often get left off the credits on songs and albums. We are the life blood of your music. Without us, there would be nothing. I can‚Äôt name many artists who can record themselves much less even set up a mic stand properly and plug in a mic without an engineer or assistants help. Forgetting or neglecting to post your support staff is fucking stupid."
1643,2020-04-20 16:57:51,g4vew2,"Thank you for asking. I can tell you a secret story to add to the Frank mystique. Nearly the entirety of Channel Orange was deleted at one point and he restarted and remade the album. We were working at EastWest for a few months and then he left for a while cuz the room was booked and he worked at Paramount, I think. When he came back to EastWest from Paramount he had a whole different album. Some of the songs had the same names or whatever but they were completely different."
1644,2020-04-20 18:40:21,g4vew2,"Fair enough lol. So I got hired to work with Ariana on a session with this producer named Detail. Detail is fucking insane. So Ariana comes in, we track her vocals, and naturally she kills it in a few hours. While she's in the booth, Nelly shows up in the room. He's friends with Detail or whatever. So Ariana comes out the booth and she is super sketched out by this whole situation but she's playing it off well. So we chat for a minute and then she pops back in the booth to finish some stuff and then she can't get out of the room fast enough. She's like ""ok thanks guys, good meeting you, peace"" immediately when she's finished singing. 

The next 14 hours were a nightmare. Nelly just decides to stay and start working with Detail. I am hired by the label in this case so I am now obligated to stay and record Nelly. After several hours of drinking, Nelly and Detail decide to leave and go to the club for a little. They return an hour later with a full Ho Train. They start arguing about whether or not its sexy to splash water on a girl's ass when you fuck her on the sink. My god it was horrible. The next time I saw Ari I was like ""yo you screwed me over with those guys last time"" and she was ""I'm so sorry, I had to get out as fast as possible."""
1645,2020-04-20 19:56:44,g4vew2,"Vic Mensa and I are like family so he's even made me dinner before. He's lived at my house and got cat hair all over his shirt. Zack de la Rocha always asks if im hungry and if I want to get something to eat. He also always pays and makes sure I'm well taken care of. I treat people how they treat me so if someone takes care me like that I will literally kill for them if it comes down to it. I've carried weapons for artists before. I'm like real into loyalty and shit.


Edit: I‚Äôm going back thru and re reading some answers and adding info. The music industry used to be a giant money laundering scheme. Well sort of anyway. They used to have all these crazy expenses. For example, recording to tape back in the day was stupid expensive but it was the only way to do it. So everyone had a tape budget. Tape was like $350 a reel and you could easily get into 5 or 6 reels a song. Most engineers tried to reuse when they could but bottom line is the labels knew tape was a big expense so the artists could basically write off whatever they wanted for the cost of it. It was well known that Fleetwood Mac‚Äôs ‚Äútape budget‚Äù was really just the cocaine fund. Anyway, all that is to say that these days, the discretionary funds for things like alcohol and drugs and even food most of the time  are gone. So if someone offers you food, it‚Äôs from their pocket. They‚Äôre paying for you and in LA, that can be pretty expensive. So someone offering to buy you food is really rare and pretty special. And yes, a lot of the time I will work 10-12 hours without a break or time to eat. Sometimes I eat at the console while I‚Äôm recording. Bigger sessions like film sessions and Disney shit usually have catered or mass ordered food which is really nice.  I‚Äôve definitely lived on cookies and snacks the studio has lying about when there wasn‚Äôt any thing else"
1646,2020-04-21 03:23:52,g4vew2,"I mean, they make generic rock music but also, a lot of people like generic ass shit. So who‚Äôs wrong?"
1647,2020-04-21 05:52:12,g4vew2,Yeah don‚Äôt feel too bad for them. They are extremely aware of their status and laugh about it constantly. They sell out fucking stadiums. They do not give a fuck. They all listen to dope music. Alice In Chains and Pantera and shit like that. They just found a way to make money and so they did that.
1648,2020-04-21 04:16:35,g4vew2,"Agreed. It‚Äôs so weird for a band to get shit for being so likable to so many different people. I mean, a lot of people really like nickelback."
1649,2020-04-20 19:52:12,g4vew2,"I guess my secret is that I'm a fucking mess so I am willing to go as dark as you need to go to get to that place. I'll blast lines of coke with you if that's what you need. I'll take acid with you and scream at the ceiling. Some producers make their artists get sober for recording. Not me. I mean, maybe you should be sober. Maybe you shouldn't be. Maybe you need to be a trainwreck in order to be what you are. I know artists that have to record as a mess because that's what they sound like. if you're going to hell to make a record then Im going with you"
1650,2020-04-20 23:59:22,g4vew2,So glad to hear that about these two
1651,2020-04-21 03:06:56,g4vew2,"That's nice to read, considering I've heard the exact opposite about Tom Morello. Goddamn Zack is a legend"
1652,2020-04-21 00:37:27,g4vew2,Do you have any stories about working with Zack de la Rocha ?
1653,2020-04-20 19:09:56,g4vew2,Yeah maybe. I just let it happen. I just open my mind to the world and it works out sometimes.
1654,2020-04-20 18:49:18,g4vew2,haha Stan the queen
1655,2020-04-20 16:48:17,g4vew2,Vic Mensa is not only an amazing rapper and extremely talented but he's also one of my best friends. When he got arrested a few months back it was me he called because he was leaving my crib. He's a great dude and I know a lot of people don't like him but he actually just got the worst rep because of some media bullshit.
1656,2020-04-20 18:44:49,g4vew2,my pleasure
1657,2020-04-20 21:20:04,g4vew2,I‚Äôve worked with them a bunch. They‚Äôre great musicians and great friends
1658,2020-04-20 19:10:45,g4vew2,I don't really know. I only met him in like 2011 I think. So he would've been finishing up 2020 around then
1659,2020-04-20 19:11:27,g4vew2,oh yeah and Ive worked with James a ton. He's an amazing writer and artist. really cool too.
1660,2020-04-20 17:50:00,g4vew2,Thanks! It‚Äôs kind of lame it got removed. I‚Äôm just trying to bring some flavor to a Monday
1661,2020-04-20 18:42:16,g4vew2,"Lol I don't know what his deal was. He was in his Lotus I think and I was crossing the street and I know he saw me but I swear to god he started speeding up. I was like ""what did I do to piss him off?"""
1662,2020-04-20 18:43:02,g4vew2,what would you like to know about the recording process? I wasn't the main assistant on the session and was mostly there to help with bullshit cuz I was just an intern then but I can remember a bit
1663,2020-04-21 05:25:32,g4vew2,"Dude. Do this. If you are not familiar. Google The Hu. Some other dude brought them up in the thread and I‚Äôve followed them from when they had just a couple thousand views on YouTube. They‚Äôre a fucking weird ass Mongolian rock band that sings crazy Mongolian tribal chants and shit over rock riffs. It‚Äôs the weirdest shit but its got millions of views. There is a market for anything and everything that exists. Just go for it. 

Your end statement is on the money. It‚Äôs stupid to not try. You can always do a boring job. There‚Äôs plenty of time to go back to it."
1664,2020-04-21 05:09:55,g4vew2,Look me up when you get to LA and we‚Äôll get lunch and chat.
1665,2020-04-21 03:58:58,g4vew2,"I was just there, I wasn‚Äôt really doing anything. Sometimes that happens where you‚Äôre in a room with a bunch of people that are far better than you at a bunch of stuff so you just stay quiet and wait for a minute to be helpful or make a good joke and if it doesn‚Äôt happen then you just go home with no added jobs on your list lol"
1666,2020-04-21 04:46:08,g4vew2,Definitely. Know your roll and shit ya know
1667,2020-04-21 02:32:35,g4vew2,"He is just a normal dude. A super rich normal dude, but pretty normal. His hospitality was A+ the whole time we were in Korea. We even made a song together with him and Vic and Gashi but I don‚Äôt think that will ever see daylight."
1668,2020-04-21 00:48:38,g4vew2,No it was a full on Queen. All pink. Etc
1669,2020-04-21 04:15:29,g4vew2,"A lot of writers do what‚Äôs called top lining, where they only sing the melody and write the words for the song. They don‚Äôt produce or anything else, just write lyrics and melodies. The best way to get into that is to find someone who is doing music and offer to help them write lyrics. And I think it‚Äôs smart to start with what you‚Äôre good at. If you start with your weakness you‚Äôre building your whole song from shitty materials. Of course you can go back later and adjust but it‚Äôs never quite right and you spend all your time polishing a turd."
1670,2020-04-21 21:08:51,g4vew2,I like making music with bands over a single artist but that‚Äôs usually just cuz I think more people usually means more ideas and more creativity but I know lots of artists that are way more creative by themselves than a whole band so as long as they are interesting I don‚Äôt really care.
1671,2020-04-20 21:58:25,g4vew2,"so i take it you guys have made amends and you're cool? Enough to stump for her on reddit, anyway. My ex girlfriend is probably my favorite singer in the world, but christ right now i wouldn't be able to be like CHECK HER OUT!!! hahaha. So good for you."
1672,2020-04-21 03:00:12,g4vew2,Is she the blonde? And does she have any social media?
1673,2020-04-21 01:16:48,g4vew2,Honeymoon Avenue is one of the best songs in her discography IMO
1674,2020-07-12 20:05:39,g4vew2,I worked as an assistant at Studio Atlantis on tons of projects but no credits. I tell people about it now and no-one believes me lol.
1675,2020-04-20 17:51:14,g4vew2,THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING THIS
1676,2020-04-20 20:28:38,g4vew2,yup. heard lots about detail. total asshole. if i was ariana i would have gotten out of there asap. so i don‚Äôt blame her. detail is the type of person that sends red alerts to all the females in the room.
1677,2020-04-20 23:23:55,g4vew2,I just burned my tongue on all this tea üíÄüíÄüíÄ
1678,2020-07-12 20:10:34,g4vew2,We always had to tell Detail he wasn't allowed to stand on top of our SSL J. He never listened. I made more trips to the SSL office in Glendale I think? To get channel strips repaired.
1679,2020-04-21 00:05:12,g4vew2,Whoa some cool Zack de la Rocha stories would be very appreciated.
1680,2020-04-20 23:21:00,g4vew2,Hot
1681,2020-04-21 03:26:01,g4vew2,"I‚Äôve worked with Tom too and I will say that while he is no Zack, he‚Äôs still a really nice guy. I actually met Tom before I met Zack and knew him for like a year or so. I will say one thing on this thread. I don‚Äôt get star struck but I was feeling something when I first started working with those two guys. I mean, Rage is why I do music. They were my favorite band when I was a kid. Now I coproduce with ZDLR. Like what the fuck is life."
1682,2020-04-21 00:45:29,g4vew2,"Man, I‚Äôve been working with zack on and off for a good while. He‚Äôs so humble and cool and not all about the rock star life. We literally talk once a week on the phone just to make sure the other isn‚Äôt losing his mind in this quarantine. Amazing dude"
1683,2020-04-20 23:29:54,g4vew2,You are an absolute gem btw
1684,2020-04-20 16:50:41,g4vew2,love to hear that! i saw him a few times back during his Kids These Days days and he always seemed like a cool guy. how was working with jay z ?
1685,2020-04-20 21:28:40,g4vew2,"oh cool, that‚Äôs good to know :) really cool AMA. I‚Äôm a songwriter and artist myself, so I work with engineers all the time (some of which have become some of my best friends), but it‚Äôs always fascinating getting this perspective because I really couldn‚Äôt imagine being in a studio and not acknowledging everyone there / knowing everyone‚Äôs name (I have this rule that I don‚Äôt trust someone with business until I know their full name lmao). but every session has a different atmosphere so I‚Äôm always just morbidly curious about the sessions I don‚Äôt get to be in, if that makes sense."
1686,2020-04-20 19:15:37,g4vew2,He‚Äôs absolutely great. He‚Äôs about to release an album I hope.
1687,2020-04-26 09:09:26,g4vew2,Sorry for late reply but anything you can remember.
1688,2020-04-21 06:36:57,g4vew2,"You got some power. You gave me this motivation that I just focused and created two songs with the lyrics and some basic vocals and the rhythm, which is already a step in the right direction. You rock <3"
1689,2020-04-21 05:31:59,g4vew2,"Haha most definitely!! Thank you again, you are amazing!!!"
1690,2020-04-21 04:11:16,g4vew2,"Ahh I see, it must be really awesome anyway to be in their presence haha. Thanks for answering!! Stay healthy!!"
1691,2020-04-21 10:26:18,g4vew2,"in the media and tv, jay park acts either like an f boi or a really sweet guy .. it's pretty refreshing to know that he's just a normal guy.

thanks for the response!"
1692,2020-04-20 22:02:57,g4vew2,I truly love her and will never stop. She will be the one that got away to me.
1693,2020-04-21 03:01:55,g4vew2,Yeah I think she‚Äôs blonde right now. Eleanorkishere is here Instagram and Twitter.
1694,2020-04-21 03:00:12,g4vew2,Easily in the top 10
1695,2020-04-20 17:54:08,g4vew2,"I could do interesting Frank stories all day.  He‚Äôs super private so obviously I wouldn‚Äôt betray his confidence on things but just general info I could do. Like for example, I can tell you that when I met Frank he could play piano but he wasn‚Äôt that good. While he was making CO he would show up every day early and have a piano lesson. By the time he was finished with the album he‚Äôd become a ridiculous piano player"
1696,2020-04-20 20:30:10,g4vew2,Yeah I‚Äôm super surprised he hasn‚Äôt gotten full metoo‚Äôd yet. Or maybe he did
1697,2020-04-21 00:50:00,g4vew2,I love zack and he loves his privacy so I‚Äôm gonna leave it to say that he is an amazing talent. You have felt no high like sitting in the studio while zack raps over a beat that the two of you made together just a few minutes before. He‚Äôs so humble and grateful for everyone in his life. Great guy
1698,2020-04-21 03:45:50,g4vew2,"That's cool to hear!!! I mean I'm mostly thinking of one incident I heard on reddit, but for as long as the guy has been making music, maybe that one time didn't define him haha. I can only imagine the shock of meeting them!!! They were also one of the first bands to get me excited about music :)

Anyway, thanks so much for the reply! I came 10 hours late so I wasn't expecting any! 

If you're down for another question, have you worked with Charli XCX or SOPHIE? If so, what were they like? üíñ"
1699,2020-04-21 00:51:12,g4vew2,That‚Äôs so great. I‚Äôve only heard good things about the guy!
1700,2020-04-21 02:54:07,g4vew2,"Hahaha thanks. I‚Äôm a regular pop head follower. I wouldn‚Äôt say pop is my favorite bit of course I stay tuned into what‚Äôs going on. It‚Äôs popular, ya know?"
1701,2020-04-20 17:11:42,g4vew2,"Jay Z is a really cool person. He's very logical and methodical with how he operates and he still never writes anything down. Just remembers all his lyrics in his head. He offered me Jamaican food once and I turned him down because I was caught off guard by *fucking jay z asking me if I wanted food* so I said no and he said ""you bugging man, that shits amazing."" Also, one time I was waiting for Vic to show up to the studio and he was late so I took a nap on the couch and Jay woke me up to ask where Dion and Vic were but I was so confused because *fucking Jay Z just fucking woke me up and what planet am I on?* and so I was just like ""I dunno man."" I kind of had a thing where every time Jay talked to me I only said and did the stupidest things.

&#x200B;

Edit for format"
1702,2020-04-20 21:32:05,g4vew2,That‚Äôs very true. I personally believe that music should be fun and we should work hard but enjoy it cuz it‚Äôs making music but sometimes the sessions are tense and people treat you like a piece of equipment which is less fun.
1703,2020-06-21 05:32:24,g4vew2,RIP.
1704,2020-04-21 06:38:05,g4vew2,That‚Äôs awesome! Good for you! Keep it up.
1705,2020-04-21 04:12:54,g4vew2,Yeah if nothing else it‚Äôs a good story for later
1706,2020-04-20 22:05:25,g4vew2,"Well, fuck"
1707,2020-04-20 22:13:34,g4vew2,Were you the worst?
1708,2020-04-20 18:23:38,g4vew2,"Once again  thank you so much for taking the time to share all these stories. Really appreciate it.  Since you're an engineer i  imagine you have a personal connection to albums you've worked on. Any lyrics or musical moments that stand out to you to this day on CO? 
I noticed your credit on Super Rich Kids on Genius. What was the process like working on a track like that. 
Slightly unrelated, I noticed you also contributed on Skrillex's Recess (through Genius). What was it like working with dubstep? Do you have any preffered genre to work with? 
I asked way too much haha either way thank you for your previous answers"

he‚Äôs not had one placement since."
1710,2020-04-21 01:08:30,g4vew2,Wow that's incredible to read. I love his music and was so pumped to see him perform this spring (before covid19 happened).
1711,2020-04-21 03:50:27,g4vew2,"I haven‚Äôt worked with either of them but I would be very excited to. To be honest, a lot of the new pop stuff eludes me because I got a little burned out working for Alex da Kid and soured on the pop world for a while. The only times I did pop after that was when someone heard about me and specifically reached out. 

I‚Äôm down to answer questions until this loses steam. I like sharing my world with people. In my opinion, my job isn‚Äôt even the most interesting thing about me. You know I got shot in Iraq in 2004? Like 30 pieces of shrapnel and bullets still in my body. My mom burned down my house for insurance money when I was a kid and we had to live on the street when her scheme failed. I‚Äôm good friends with a few congressmen. I‚Äôm a fairly interesting human IMHO."
1712,2020-04-20 17:16:50,g4vew2,thats amazing. thanks for the repsonse!
1713,2020-04-20 22:06:34,g4vew2,Yeah sometimes life‚Äôs just like that
1714,2020-04-20 22:14:10,g4vew2,Some days. Some days I was just trying to get through my own darkness ya know?
1715,2020-04-20 18:31:15,g4vew2,"I really do like all music. I‚Äôve worked on country and pop and rap all the same. The skrillex record I did was actually really cool because his process at the time was to record bands doing original compositions and then he would cut those compositions up. It saved him a ton of money because he could pay the artists a day rate rather than publishing. So my part on that was literally to just record a band, same as every other day. If you‚Äôre gonna do dubstep, the best way is not doing dubstep, lol. Most of CO kind of blends together because I was so new to the industry back then I didn‚Äôt know what I was doing and how I was supposed to act. I do remember one night, Frank came in and we spent 4 hours getting an ad lib right. He tried that ‚Äúyeah‚Äù in every conceivable way. We did 132 takes of a yeah. So suffice it to say that frank can be meticulous in his song writing. There isn‚Äôt a single note on anything he‚Äôs ever done that he didn‚Äôt agonize over the execution of. That‚Äôs why his music takes so long. He‚Äôs making it perfect"
1716,2020-04-20 20:37:10,g4vew2,Oh good. That‚Äôs great news. Yeah I felt like ari was keeping me between them the whole time. Like I was her shield against perv
1717,2020-04-21 17:10:04,g4vew2,The one that got away
1718,2020-04-21 09:18:37,g4vew2,Really? I need some help so th my own darkness but I may not be who you‚Äôre looking for? Can you take me to silent hills?
1719,2020-04-20 23:45:37,g4vew2,Did his strive for perfection ever come off as diva behavior? Or did it always feel right because it was frank ocean? I feel like it would be the latter. Thank you so much for this ama!
1720,2020-04-21 01:54:02,g4vew2,Do you remember the song that the ‚Äúyeah‚Äù was perfected too?
1721,2020-04-21 01:24:28,g4vew2,I‚Äôm glad someone was there to protect her. Your presence probably made a big difference.
1722,2020-04-21 00:48:08,g4vew2,"I never complained about staying late to get it right because when he did finally get it, it was right."
1723,2020-04-21 02:48:14,g4vew2,She was always very sweet to me and she was very tiny and nice so I did feel like I was always trying to look out for her. We only worked together a handful of times but I remember meeting her mom and hanging out with her a bit. Really nice people. I think some celebrities get a lot flack for shit that we forget is just normal kid shit but their normal kid shit is broadcast to the world
1724,2020-04-21 04:32:43,g4vew2,"Right? Imagine being this tiny woman in a small room with two large, creepy guys sending off alarm bells. Ari was probably so thankful for u/tokyographic. I'm so glad she was safe!"
1725,2020-04-21 00:48:28,g4vew2,Thanks for the answer!
1726,2020-04-21 04:47:51,g4vew2,"I don‚Äôt want to sound like Detail was being aggressive or anything, he was a creep. Nelly said my favorite quote of my entire career 


‚ÄúMan I know about pussy. No one got more pussy than me in 2002 and I had a band aid on my face, dog‚Äù"
1727,2020-04-21 05:08:40,g4vew2,"Yeah, but judging from a few of the comments, Detail is the kind of dude who would give off alarm bells to women, even if he weren't being a creep at the exact moment ‚Äì and women have come out against him. So I'm glad Ari listened to whatever vibes she was picking up on and bounced! Otherwise she might have been another one of his alleged victims."

1729,2020-04-20 10:53:32,g4q75w,"I've never known of anyone basing intelligence on knowledge of pop culture, if anything it's the opposite, people tend to think that someone really into pop culture doesn't know much about anything more important."
1730,2020-04-20 10:19:51,g4q75w,"So you mean stuff like which of the kardashians takes the biggest dumps and stuff like that? 

To be honest, no one ever called me stupid because I didn‚Äôt know about certain celebrities, songs, whatever."
1731,2020-04-20 10:13:28,g4q75w,Is knowledge intelligence if you don't have the higher order thinking skills to do anything with the information?
1732,2020-04-20 11:39:04,g4q75w,Seriously. Pop culture is fucking IRRELEVANT to me.
1733,2020-04-20 12:38:10,g4q75w,I feel like that‚Äôs just a thing that teenagers do
1734,2020-04-20 17:08:59,g4q75w,"Hey, did you see that movie with that one actor?

Sorry, I wouldn't know. I'm honestly not familiar with and don't follow any actors.

Wow, really? Why not?

It's not important to me.

That's weird.


Well lads and ladies, we've arrived at a time where having fairly basic knowledge of history makes you a ""history buff"", or knowing how to use file manager makes you ""tech-savvy"", but not knowing actors/actresses/sports is considered weird. Nice"
1735,2020-04-20 21:15:25,g4q75w,"I once told my ex that I don't really care about celebrities. She called me shallow for that. Broke up with her soon after, I still can't believe people care about celeberties.

What's worse is that I constantly see the from of reddit covered in celeberties saying ""orange man bad"". Seriously why do these kids get their opinions from celeberties?"
1736,2020-04-20 17:35:44,g4q75w,"Believe it or not there are some people on reddit who take pride in not knowing about a certain section of pop culture. I remember when Juice WRLD died and his thread was on the front page, the very first comment I saw was ‚ÄúWho‚Äù and the reply to it was ‚ÄúGeneric Mumble Rapper #13525‚Äù. I imagine these people think that since they browse reddit they know everything so when they haven‚Äôt heard of juice wrld they just cast him aside as unimportant and irrelevant."
1737,2020-04-20 23:18:13,g4q75w,I don't think anyone on earth has ever been called stupid for *not* knowing who Justin Bieber is
1738,2020-04-20 15:31:33,g4q75w,"People 100% ingrained in pop culture think in terms of a status hierarchy. The more you know and emulate Kanye's latest fashion trends or the latest NBA player gossip etc the ""cooler"" you are. The closer you are to being pop culture famous in that respect, the superior you are. It's a shallow world of nobody IG models suddenly being messaged by pro-sports players and their accounts taking off. They consider anyone not playing this hierarchical game to be a loser, or at least completely off the radar. Everything they are comes from pop culture, and there is almost no part of their identity that isn't programmed by it."
1739,2020-04-20 11:13:07,g4q75w,"It goes both ways, I agree"
1740,2020-04-20 10:22:05,g4q75w,"I mean not being involved in the pop community, knowing who famous actors/singers are, knowing what certain songs/movies are etc."
1741,2020-04-20 10:16:16,g4q75w,No it isnt. Knowledge and intelligence are two different yet dependent things.
1742,2020-04-20 10:17:10,g4q75w,I know someone who knows the periodic table off by heart but can't explain to you what an element is... Smh
1743,2020-04-20 17:15:50,g4q75w,Then I'm happy to be considered weird.
1744,2020-04-20 15:40:40,g4q75w,"I get all of that, I know that some people do base their whole lives on pop culture, more specifically teens, most people grow out of it either completely or at least to a certain extent when they get adult responsibilities and real life takes over. That's still not the same as comparing pop culture knowledge with intelligence though, you can have the ""coolest"" person in the world completely absorbed in pop culture and they may get respect from people who idolise them but that still doesn't mean that it is seen as being intelligent."
1745,2020-04-20 10:45:11,g4q75w,This seems like a high school thing.
1746,2020-04-20 16:27:40,g4q75w,"I agree. I think everyone is intelligent. It's just up to each individual to use that intelligence or not. A lot of people, regardless of whether they follow pop culture or not, simply do not use their intelligence."

Judging by the angle and the monster energy can on the floor, it appears to be around 7.5 inches long and 3.5 inches wide, great job sport! The veins are most likely my favorite part, the accents of blue contrast beautifully on your white cock. The head is near perfect, the wrinkles are pretty much invisible, judging by the slight gloss on it, you're using it ;). The head is also significantly larger in circumference than the shaft of the penis, but that's never a bother to anyone. The balls aren't quite perfectly symmetrical, as the right testicles droops down by about half an inch lower than the left testicle. The slight imperfections of the testicles are quickly overpowered by the masterpiece that is your pubic hair. All I can say is wow. What type of razer do you use?

Whenever I read a news story about a girl getting murdered, I check for photos to see if she's hot. If she is, I download her pics and add it to my folder.

It's not the girls' beauty that gets me off, even though they usually are beautiful.

It's the twisted thrill of realizing that she's more or less forgotten, except perhaps by the most aggrieved friends and family members -- and even they have to ease up on thinking about her constantly if they even hope to move on with their lives.

She's remembered less and less by acquaintances, friends, mentors -- anyone who's life she touched. At the moment I'm touching myself to her, I'm one of the only people in the world still thinking about her.

And yet, as I dredge her memory out of the darkness, it's not to venerate her or celebrate her life -- it's to desecrate her, sexually dominate her, make the whole affair some perverse monument to the fear and desperation she must have felt, right before ended.

And then I cum.

1820,2020-05-03 05:04:56,gckm3y,"Not mentioned on the list but I think it's actually NCT. It already seems apparent lately since they are growing really big. But from the four groups mentioned here, maybe ATEEZ or TXT. But I'm kinda worried for ATEEZ since their domestic fanbase are really small."
1821,2020-05-03 05:20:08,gckm3y,"I don't think that any of those would be the next big thing. The most popular boy group usually comes from the Big 3, so I don't TXT, MCND or Ateez would go that big since they're not from the Big 3. Koreans prefer idols from the Big 3 better because of the companies history in debuting successful idols. The trend with boy groups who are not from the Big 3, they only get the attention during debut years and their hype will die down after a few comebacks if they can't keep up with what the audiences want. So TXT, MCND and ATEEZ are out. But on the other hand, fans also don't prefer big groups as much especially if they haven't known them yet. Stray Kids and Treasure have a lot of members and I'm not sure if fans would love that if they're not there with the group when they were on survival shows. Usually, younger fans are willing to stan big groups because older fans are just tired of remembering more than 7 members in a group. Song wise, Treasure is the closest one to success because their song is capable of attracting new fans. I personally don't think that any of these groups would make it big because they all have some flaws in their strategy, mostly because they're big groups and not coming from the Big 3. I think that there will be another group preferably from the Big 3 that will dominate the industry but that's just my prediction. It will a group like Bigbang or EXO but never the same as BTS because BTS is just an odd group if you want to compare them together."
1822,2020-05-03 04:46:58,gckm3y,"I‚Äôm sorry, but who are MCND?"
1823,2020-05-03 11:19:57,gckm3y,"I think Stray Kids has a lot of potential to become the next big thing. (they are my faves so i might be biased)

their music style is unique and they  have very versatil sounds. what also is a big + is their ability to communicate with their fans. they have two native english speakers and several members who speak very good english. 

also they are a selfproduced group. i know its not that big of a pro but  for me it personally makes the group more ""real"" to me idk how to explain"
1824,2020-05-03 04:52:50,gckm3y,"Has there been an update about Jin enlisting that I don't know about? Most people say he doesn't need to go until end of next year, so they have lots more time. Unless they all enlist together I think they'll continue to be the top group anyway."
1825,2020-05-03 05:11:02,gckm3y,"exo's popularity is still very much going strong considering they have such little promotions for comebacks but i digress 

i think that out of these groups MCND and TXT have the biggest chance of being the so called ""next big thing"". 

ateez is relatively popular and well-known but i think a lot of their hype has died down in the past few months. however it could just because their comeback was a while ago and that there isn't much content from the group now. i'm a big fan of stray kids but their music isn't something that the general public likes, but their fanbase is rly compact and can only get bigger from here.

i'm not too familiar with MCND but i think they're pretty impressive considering they debuted with a unique concept in the middle of a period where most boy groups are doing either dark or like sexy concepts. they're doing really well in korea and i'm sure their concept will be really popular with a lot of younger people joining the 4th/5th gen of fans in the future.

TXT is also really popular, my only worry though is that a lot of their fans were just armies that happened to support BTS's little brother group. they're having another comeback pretty soon though, so i think we can generally should be able predict how well they'll do in the incoming year from this comeback. they have a very interesting concept too and their music is very public/most kpop fans friendly so they have a good chance of being even more popular than before.

treasure has the potential to have a really explosive debut because fans have been waiting so long for them to debut. as for what they'll continue to be like, well it just depends whether or not their musical concept is interesting enough to compete with the other groups."
1826,2020-07-20 18:38:12,gckm3y,"Out of these, Stray Kids and Treasure have the best chance because of their company backing. If you've been into kpop for a while then you know that the chances of getting huge without being backed by one of the big 3 are slim to none. BTS got lucky because other fandoms helped them win at the BBMAs and launch them onto the world stage - if not for that, if not for the help of the entire Kpop fandom, then EXO would still be #1. So honestly, my prediction is that either NCT takes the crown, likely NCT 127 since they're the most known and stanned internationally, or SM's new boy group will. YG and JYPE always have good outings at first but then eventually their sales flop in comparison to SM, and the scandals throughout YG have really hurt them and the way people view their artists."
1827,2020-08-14 01:24:17,gckm3y,"My favorite right now are Treasure, Stray Kids and ATEEZ."
1828,2020-05-03 06:07:42,gckm3y,I could see MCND or TXT getting big. Maybe Stray Kids
1829,2020-05-03 06:41:48,gckm3y,I don't stan any of the groups here apart from SKZ and it really hurts seeing nobody pick stray kids :(
1830,2020-05-03 06:27:41,gckm3y,"Personally I don't think there will be another BTS, some other Kpop groups may gain moderate traction but nowhere near their level. That being said, if there is going to be another Kpop act to take the western market by storm, I think it will be a girl group like Blackpink or (G)I-DLE. 

Regarding your actual question tho, I think MCND has a lot of potential and could really do well if promoted properly. They seem to be fairly popular both internationally and domestically so far. I think ATEEZ and Stray Kids may have already reached their peaks in terms of popularity. From what I understand, they have a devoted fandom but their style of music doesn't appeal much to general audiences. TXT has been successful right off the bat and I could totally see BigHit investing more into their music/promotion once BTS starts enlisting. With the state of YG right now, I hope Treasure can get them back on track. It's just that with the demand for a BP comeback and the rumored new YG girl group, I'm concerned if they'll be able to debut and with all their members. I would also consider groups like NCT 127, Monsta X, Seventeen, and iKon in the same category as Ateez and Stray Kids. 

Overall I would my pick would be on TXT."
1831,2020-05-03 07:55:05,gckm3y,I want to say ATEEZ because to me they stand out the most but I think MCND and TXT have more public friendly music.  Honestly I‚Äôd love to see any of these groups hit it big; they‚Äôre all really talented and fun to watch!
1832,2020-05-03 04:45:47,gckm3y,"txt, so far their music has been public friendly and they maintain a good storyline + message."
1833,2020-05-15 18:56:08,gckm3y,"We don't know about Treasure since they haven't debuted properly yet and if YG is clever they will use this controversy to their advantage to spark up attention for their actual debut as a fake underdog group trying to make a new image, since YG with winner blackpink and GD still have support behind them. They will do well but I'd love to see how well they do especially after their highly advertised pre debut members and reality show. 
They are very popular so it'll be interesting 
Idk anything about mcnd I've heard about them but I didn't see enough about them to get me interested.
Straykids had the upper hand by having fans from being from a big company and having a reality T.V show that was very known and advertised well. But they're not gaining any more fans at a fast rate alot of fans prefer other groups, I genuinely don't think they will be the next big thing they will be popular but I don't think they will be the biggest from what I'm seeing they're not good at attracting fans, they may do a bit better in Korea but not internationally in the US, Europe and Saudi. If you're from any other international countries I can't speak on since I'm not from those nations and don't speak their language to know what groups they talk about.

Ateez have alot of haters who are bitter at their success rate they did that with their expedition assuming they did it too soon even though fans were the ones demanding them and they were hoping and planning for their failure but they exceeded expectations and even had to add more tickets. But the hate didn't stop there for this small company group with 22 staff at first, even with their tour that was meant to happen in April March people thought they would not sell out these huge venues but they outsold venues that even superm, monstax, straykids etc couldn't sell and had to even add more tickets after.
The only rookie group that's actually popular in the US is Ateez even here in an unbiased survey, in July 2019 Ateez was the second most popular group after BTS in the survey.

I hope the best for all"
1834,2020-09-23 10:33:11,gckm3y,"Additional 1M additional subscribers within 40 days from debut to comeback, and 100k new subs in 5 days after their comeback, TREASURE is attracting fans like crazy. Their variety series are being aired on SBS primetime starting tonight. With the end of school in Korea, my bet is they would attract a huge following in their home country. They already gunned down the physicals and international charting with their stronghold of SEA, China and Japan and soon the new wave of SK local fans will help them with domestic charting. I have said this 2 months ago, and I will say it again.. TREASURE IS THE NEXT BIG THING. :)"
1835,2020-05-03 05:15:56,gckm3y,Ateez and MCND
1836,2020-05-03 16:08:09,gckm3y,hm do you think itd be nct as a whole or only one unit though?
1837,2020-05-03 05:58:50,gckm3y,"you might be right but at the same time not really, because 4 years ago NOBODY would've expected BTS to become the monster group they are no days, but look at them now, back in 2016 I would've never thought there would ever be any group to top Exo's massive success in those years, but BTS proved everyone wrong, so like, you never really know"
1838,2020-05-03 16:16:14,gckm3y,txt have only been getting bigger since debut tho. i see new people stanning them everyday on twitter
1839,2020-05-03 04:56:05,gckm3y,"they're a newly debuted group in 2020, they're from the company Top Media which is owned by an SM artist I think, the company houses Teen Top and up10tion which has Wooseok former X1 member! as the other comment said they are fairly popular in Korea for a rookie group from a small company and have been getting a lot of hype from international fans lately because of their songs Ice Age and Top Gang. As I said they only debuted 2 months ago tho, so they still have room for improvement"
1840,2020-05-03 04:49:47,gckm3y,"they're a new boy group that debuted in feb 2020 with the song ""ice age""! they have 5 members and their group is pretty popular in korea rn and mildly known among international fans"

1842,2020-05-03 19:00:39,gckm3y,I believe all 92 liners have to enlist by the end of his year/early 2021. Hoony from Winner is a 92 liner and he enlisted last month!
1843,2020-08-14 01:26:56,gckm3y,"well Treasure is getting popular now. They write their own songs, all visuals, not your typical YG BG, they can dance like hell. My bet is Treasure, Ateez and Stray Kids as the Big 3 of the 4th Generation imho."
1844,2020-08-14 01:34:13,gckm3y,well BlackPink is still on top. Treasure #3 all time debut. So its Treasure and Stray Kids for me. I wonder why NCT isnt getting popular even if SM pushes them so hard. And now they have SuperM.

Someone mentioned kpop could be similar to Anime - it's not shoved in people's faces that way it is these days, it's not included in major award shows, but it's presence is *there* and there are still fans present. Like a subculture."
1849,2020-05-15 19:07:25,gckm3y,"Straykids may have reached their peak I used to be fan but they got old and can't engage fans to get new ones but I think Ateez are still rising, each comeback they get more views and albums sales even though they started with the lowest sales for 4th generation boygroup selling like ~430 albums. Even in the quarantine they're vlives are getting more and more views and most importantly what I noticed about this groups fans is that they have a very active engaged fan base compared to majority of teams clealry showing they didnt buy views or followers.
Their fans are still intrigued and interested with the group,though because of their success they do have alot of hate from other groups since they don't like how fast and quick they're gaining success"
1850,2020-08-14 01:29:26,gckm3y,the new YG GG will be a China based one similar to WayV.
1851,2020-05-03 23:11:24,gckm3y,Why are you being downvoted?
1852,2020-08-14 01:31:30,gckm3y,Look at Treasure now. 20M YT views in 1week + 170k album sales. #3 behind Itzy and TXT in debut. And they are not your typical YG BG.
1853,2020-05-03 16:31:11,gckm3y,Maybe Dream considering they got first win first but I think 127 would follow not long after. I could be wrong tho.
1854,2020-05-03 06:50:07,gckm3y,"BTS just got lucky. If it wasn't for Bbmas they wouldn't have gotten where they are now. Their songs were great and that's why they beat the odds. There's a lot of other groups out there who deserve better because of the quality of their songs but they're not lucky enough. There's a formula for a successful group and it all starts with someone in the Big 3, good songs, good members and luck."

I totally agree that Kpop is a very niche genre to the general public but it has a very strong/vocal international following which will keep it afloat. Kpop isn't going anywhere and believe the industry will continue to thrive long after they start enlisting."

The 70s had ABBA, David Bowie, Elton John, Donna Summer etc"
1892,2020-05-02 13:40:46,gc64em,I would‚Äôve voted for the 10s if music hadn‚Äôt pivoted towards RnB and trap music in the later years of the decade. Everything started sounding dull and the same. The 2000s will forever have my heart.

1894,2020-05-02 13:16:37,gc64em,I voted 10's... then again 10's pop wouldn't be what it is without 80's & 90's pop. üçæ

1914,2020-05-01 20:48:10,gbplc6,If it's a good showing from JB this could be a big hit with staying power. It's gonna chart high either way but longevity is gonna be the question
1915,2020-05-01 20:23:41,gbplc6,OMG DOO WOPIANA IS BACK
1916,2020-05-01 20:23:16,gbplc6,"This instrumental reminds me of ‚ÄúTattooed Heart‚Äù and ‚ÄúMoonlight.‚Äù I like doo-wop Ariana as much as banger Ariana so this is already right up my alley, even though we‚Äôre teased with just a snippet."
1917,2020-05-01 20:50:52,gbplc6,Tattooed Heart vibes!!!
1918,2020-05-01 20:24:23,gbplc6,Kinda sounds like love on the brain
1919,2020-05-01 20:51:12,gbplc6,Hmmm..this actually sounds like it could be nice.
1920,2020-05-02 00:50:01,gbplc6,It sounds so much like Ed Sheeran - Perfect
1921,2020-05-02 03:50:06,gbplc6,Did anyone else try to sing the pre-chorus of Ed Sheeran's Perfect to this or is it just me? XD
1922,2020-05-01 23:01:28,gbplc6,Wait I actually like this
1923,2020-05-01 21:40:54,gbplc6,"Oh wow. 

This complements Ariana's vocals far more than Bieber's. She has the ability to hold her own on a track like this. I really do think the man is going to be completely overshadowed."
1924,2020-05-01 20:42:22,gbplc6,okay thank god it doesn‚Äôt sound like a another generic trap song
1925,2020-05-01 20:52:07,gbplc6,"I think it can. Ariana usually charts high but doesn;t have as much longetivity as Justin while Justin charts fairly high but has shown incredible longetivity on some songs like 10000 hours, Intentions, I don't care etc."
1926,2020-05-02 02:27:04,gbplc6,screaming @ this name omg even funnier if you say it in Cardi b‚Äôs voice
1927,2020-05-01 21:39:14,gbplc6,more like Sounds Exactly like it. And Perfect. And Dangerous Woman. And Lover.
1928,2020-05-01 23:59:57,gbplc6,"ToddInTheShadows once said Justin's voice was like Vocal tofu, in that it had no real flavour on its own but had the ability to complement other people's voices quite well. So yeah I think when matched with a vocalist like Ariana he's gonna be outshadowed (especially if she has some nice runs and high notes) but he could provide a good base and support to the song and give it some structure."
1929,2020-05-02 08:29:36,gbplc6,you haven't even heard ariana's vocals tho?
1930,2020-05-01 20:43:28,gbplc6,Just asking: are there any trap pop songs that don‚Äôt sound generic to you?
1931,2020-05-01 20:52:45,gbplc6,I agree as long as we don't get bad guy remix JB lol
1932,2020-05-01 23:58:05,gbplc6,It's the basic duwop beat that 100s of songs have used since the 50s.
1933,2020-05-02 07:19:55,gbplc6,"ah yeah, first one I thought of was Lover"
1934,2020-05-01 23:58:24,gbplc6,It's the basic duwop beat that 100s of songs have used since the 50s.

1936,2020-05-02 08:31:21,gbplc6,"I have, actually. She's a very famous singer."
1937,2020-05-02 08:35:47,gbplc6,"no but you said ""this compliments ariana's vocals more than bieber's"" how are you comparing them when you haven't heard the actual vocals ? lol, u gotta wait until it's out and not judge based on whatever they've released in the past"
1938,2020-05-02 08:42:44,gbplc6,"I know what Ariana's voice sounds like. 

I know what Justin's voice sounds like. 

I know what this instrumental sounds like. 

It only requires a base amount of imagination from there. 

It's perfectly fine to judge artists by past releases. It's actually the only thing they should be judged by. 

Obviously that comment wasn't a definitive review of a project that hasn't yet been released. It was a comment on what artists of particular ability and talent are likely to excel at, informed by their past work."

1959,2020-06-26 17:55:25,hg2n4x,"You asked for a reason why and I‚Äôll give it to you. Doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not because of the conspiracy, or because they don‚Äôt want people to know the truth so they hide.

But one reason could be $$$. Most videos that pop up about topics are branded companies, main stream companies that are partnered with google/YouTube. It is in the company‚Äôs best interest to push these channels‚Äô views up and therefore generate more money. For example, SNL can generate much more revenue than a regular YouTube video in regards to a topic. It has credibility, it is censored appropriately due to how many people work on the production of it and reviewing it, it is much more professional. So it makes the site look better, and gives them more money. People are more inclined to click on ads, purchase, etc. 

Doesn‚Äôt mean the content is valid. In fact, SNL covering pizzagate is BS and leaves out many things.

Does this mean they are trying to hide things, keep things professional, or a mixture of two? Is this how the folks who are the top of these companies in terms of managing business and such are kept away from the darkness behind it? Perhaps."

This is obvious when you look at Bieber‚Äôs Twitter. His team went to great lengths to get him an alibi that would prove his innocence. It helps a lot that Selena Gomez was his primary alibi, because she‚Äôs a celebrity and her whereabouts are pretty well documented, especially when Bieber and Gomez are in the same vicinity, which was part of Justin‚Äôs alibi.

What does Chris have in that same vein? Most likely nothing. He messages young girls, then has them message him on his hidden phone number or deleted SnapChat and then none of what happens next is documented.

So yeah. Chris and his team have a *lot* of work to do before suing for defamation."

In the US, I know a public figure can only sue if an organisation knowingly proliferated information they knew was false for commercial profit, or didn't check responsibly into whether the allegations were false. I think LA Times could maybe face an action.

If he goes for Rossi, things would be more complicated, because he *was* creeping on her when she was 16, and her saying she wanted to fuck him 5 years later doesn't really negate that. There could be a legal case for her (and the others) suing him for solicitation of a minor... Not sure what the statute of limitations are there, could be different per state.

It'd also alienate him further in the court of public opinion and he'd become even more ""Chris Pedo'elia."" I can only speak for Australian law, but defamation cases VERY rarely actually help vindicate reputation, and the likelihood of actually recovering lost earning from these nobodies is extremely low - plus the cost of court proceedings... It's designed to only be used as punishment by the very rich. It wouldn't be worth his time.

**Edit**: I am speculating on legal implications for Chris in defamation and possible criminal charges he could face without passing judgement. Solicitation of a minor is a crime regardless of not knowing she was a minor according to criminal statute in America. Google it yourself."

One of the most conspicuous accusations he's yet to confront is that 16 year old who sent him nudes and had proof their conversation went on afterwards. I believe her name is Michaela something and she's gone public on Twitter. 

Then we get into if he ever sent them pictures of himself while they were underage. He's in deep shit if he sent a dick pic without knowing one of their ages first. These are all felony convictions.

I'd be interested to know how he responds to the girl who posted that picture in the bus that he commented on, because for me that was the biggest yikes to come out in the past week. 

Bieber's accuser made very clear statements of fact surrounding what Bieber did to her. There's a lot more innuendo.

Also no, I haven't experienced sexual assault and I never claimed to, but the scenario I wrote about the robbery is something that happened to a friend of mine living in a shitty neighborhood. It's a traumatic experience and he was diagnosed with depression and PTSD after the fact. That event has had a lasting effect on him for the last 7-8 years or so. He was terrified (and still afraid to live alone fwiw) but he still called the police.

I'm also not victim shaming, I'm questioning the credibility of these accusers. I understand that delayed sexual abuse reports DO happen and I'm sure every victim has their own reason for that. I also understand fake sexual abuse accusations DO happen, and so I'm waiting to see actual proof from all of these anonymous accusers.

Less certain on American criminal codes regarding sexual solicitation of minors, but I know they're tougher than Australian ones - which means it stands to reason Chris is in the shit if any of the claims can be proven. Nice quoting, now pony up some statutes for the states the girls are in, because it'll depend per state how stringent the rules are. 

The fact you're acting like any of this is an indictment of him, and not a discussion of what might happen, shows that maybe you're looking for a strawman, and I'm not willing to be it. Go fight the downvoted people below, s'embarassing.

Edit: Lol, got curious. Here's what I found about American solitication of child laws: 

The child-solicitation statute makes it a felony punishable by up to three years in prison for ‚Äú[a] person 18 years of age or older‚Äù to solicit ‚Äúa child or someone the person reasonably believes is a child to engage in sexual conduct with intent to engage in sexual conduct.‚Äù Solicitation may occur ‚Äúin person, by telephone, by letter, or by computerized or other electronic means‚Äù (emphasis added)‚Ä¶ The statute clearly states that ‚Äú[m]istake as to age is not a defense to a prosecution under this section.‚Äù

So it'd be about the lawyers proving the 'reasonable belief' argument."
2057,2020-06-26 06:36:32,hfxlh6,"Yep, I know exactly which one you're talking about. There's been chatter on AMA threads too going back six years. As others have pointed out, there's a huge distinction between being an annoying sex pest with young of-age women and being a pedophile, although I know a lot of our views have changed since all of this began to unfold. Personally, I don't see him as the happy-go-lucky silver-spoon Youngest Man In The World comedian I once did, but more troubled, compulsive and controlling than I realised.

Again, Chris has to have **knowingly** asked underage girls for nudes. There's no evidence of that, and seeing how the top accusers have all been outed for lying/fabricating/manipulating conversations, that's not gonna happen.

Yeah, you cited the statute, but it's been upheld as Unconstitutional.

And here's proof:

>Say you are trying to pick someone up online for sex. You‚Äôve never met in person, but she tells you in your online conversation that she‚Äôs above the age of consent (16 in most states, 17 in some others, 18 in still others). Let‚Äôs say that you have no reason to think she‚Äôs lying, but she is: It turns out that she‚Äôs underage. You never meet and you never have sex. Can you still be prosecuted for soliciting a minor for sex, on a ‚Äústrict liability‚Äù theory ‚Äî i.e., that you were trying to pick up someone who turns out to be underage, even though you didn‚Äôt know this or have reason to know it?
No, says today‚Äôs Minnesota Court of Appeals decision in State v. Moser, holding that a state strict liability solicitation statute was unconstitutional.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2016/08/08/no-strict-liability-for-soliciting-minor-online-for-sex-if-minor-claimed-she-was-above-the-age-of-consent/

>The child-solicitation statute makes it a felony punishable by up to three years in prison for ‚Äú[a] person 18 years of age or older‚Äù to solicit ‚Äúa child [defined as someone under age 16] or someone the person reasonably believes is a child to engage in sexual conduct with intent to engage in sexual conduct.‚Äù Solicitation may occur ‚Äúin person, by telephone, by letter, or by computerized or other electronic means‚Äù (emphasis added)‚Ä¶. The statute clearly states that ‚Äú[m]istake as to age is not a defense to a prosecution under this section.‚Äù

As you said ^

>Typically, criminal offenses require both a volitional act and a criminal intent, referred to as mens rea.

2094,2020-06-26 06:05:03,hfxlh6,TIL statutes and case law didn't matter from a baby in /r/chrisdelia. Thanks man.
2095,2020-06-27 01:32:40,hfxlh6,You are still talking about sex with a person you think is a minor.. just wow LOL
2096,2020-06-26 06:07:04,hfxlh6,"Go re-read the post above. I filled it with proof that your statute is unconstitutional and has been upheld by a court decision. I'll post it here again for you in fact.

> Chris doesn't have to knowingly solicit her.

Yeah, you cited the statute, but it's been upheld as Unconstitutional.

And here's proof:

>Say you are trying to pick someone up online for sex. You‚Äôve never met in person, but she tells you in your online conversation that she‚Äôs above the age of consent (16 in most states, 17 in some others, 18 in still others). Let‚Äôs say that you have no reason to think she‚Äôs lying, but she is: It turns out that she‚Äôs underage. You never meet and you never have sex. **Can you still be prosecuted for soliciting a minor for sex, on a ‚Äústrict liability‚Äù theory ‚Äî i.e., that you were trying to pick up someone who turns out to be underage, even though you didn‚Äôt know this or have reason to know it?
No, says today‚Äôs Minnesota Court of Appeals decision in State v. Moser, holding that a state strict liability solicitation statute was unconstitutional.**

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2016/08/08/no-strict-liability-for-soliciting-minor-online-for-sex-if-minor-claimed-she-was-above-the-age-of-consent/

>The child-solicitation statute makes it a felony punishable by up to three years in prison for ‚Äú[a] person 18 years of age or older‚Äù to solicit ‚Äúa child [defined as someone under age 16] or someone the person reasonably believes is a child to engage in sexual conduct with intent to engage in sexual conduct.‚Äù Solicitation may occur ‚Äúin person, by telephone, by letter, or by computerized or other electronic means‚Äù (emphasis added)‚Ä¶. The statute clearly states that ‚Äú[m]istake as to age is not a defense to a prosecution under this section.‚Äù

As you said ^

>Typically, criminal offenses require both a volitional act and a criminal intent, referred to as mens rea. A statute imposes strict liability when it dispenses with mens rea by failing to ‚Äúrequire the defendant to know the facts that make his conduct illegal.‚Äù The state argues that the child-solicitation statute does not impose strict liability because it requires an ‚Äúintent to engage in sexual conduct.‚Äù **But it is the intent to engage in sexual conduct with a child that makes the conduct illegal, not the intent to engage in sexual conduct generally.

I‚Äôm so weary about believing stuff on twitter, especially on stan twitter because people are ruthless with their stanning and anti-stanning.

Infact most victims of sexual assault rarely come forward due to retaliation and belief no one will believe them. The burden of proof for sexual assault is so high and the hurdle for victims to pass is even higher. The threats that come with trying come forward from the abuse and that not one victim of sexual assault has ever profited off of their story leaves me feeling very gross about this and about folks finding this a good thing"

- Sexual abuse victims arent going to be intimidated by the prospect that a rich white male is able to sue for 20 million dollars if theyre team can prove doubt in a court system about someone speaking out. It already takes a tremendous amount of confidence to speak up and i dont see this as a positive. If proved wrong it would not only be their reputation on the line but their entire life.

I in no way believe that fake allegations are okay and believe there needs to be a systematic change that allows incrimination of these instances but Im not going to applaud a 20 million dollar sue to prove a point.

And to those arguing that fake allegations make people take real ones less seriously - the people using that bullshit excuse was already looking for reasons not to and never truly did take victims seriously. It's really no different than people that let bad faith actors or extremists ruin entire ideologies or movements like BLM or feminism - that arguments is and has always been nothing more than an excuse and I would really encourage people to start looking beyond it."

I might be wrong but to sue someone for defamation or false allegation you‚Äôd have to prove that you didn‚Äôt do it then? This was about an allegation not a counter lawsuit. If a woman presses charges then the burden of proof is on her. But hes suing so the burden of proof is on him to prove she‚Äôs making false allegations. I know the system is incredibly screwed up but if a woman made a genuine allegation it wouldn‚Äôt be in the rapists interest to say ‚Äúno I didn‚Äôt so I‚Äôm suing you for 20 million‚Äù because then they open themselves up to polygraphs and lines of questioning that could actually point to their guilt."

And, you know, the fact that someone's reputation was absolutely shattered into pieces, but that seems to be way down the list of things you are concerned about."
2193,2020-06-26 10:39:54,hfwnb5,Attention.  Some people are desperate for it.
2194,2020-06-26 02:07:01,hfwnb5,"Just to add on to the other comments, the first allegation said they 

1. had photographic evidence (which they wouldn't reveal for legal purposes?)   
2. they corroborated their stories with their close friends/family at the time.   
   
Since Bieber called them out, neither the photos nor the testimonies have been revealed, even though given the blueprint of Weinstein, R Kelly, Cosby etc it would be pretty simple for the accuser to either create a new account and post them, or contact a journalist and provide them with the evidence."
2195,2020-06-26 01:49:29,hfwnb5,"Oh yea man the biebs came with RECEIPTS. Photo evidence, air bnb evidence, Selena hasn‚Äôt confirmed but he essentially proved he was with her and I doubt they‚Äôd have brought her name into it without okay‚Äôing with her/her team first. 

Obvi I‚Äôm not a professional so do your own research but yea last I read, he legitimately proved there‚Äôs no way he could have been where and when the allegations said he was.

Edit - it looks like there are multiple allegations as I‚Äôm digging. I don‚Äôt have any large opinions on Bieber myself but last I checked two days ago the above rang true. Looks like it‚Äôs still developing"
2196,2020-06-26 02:45:05,hfwnb5,"I‚Äôm the first person to advocate for other victims, but in this instance there‚Äôs no reason to believe it‚Äôs true. They deleted the tweet, Bieber has an alibi for exactly where he was that day, and I think the person even deleted the account. There‚Äôs a big difference between someone speaking out with any sort of credibility and a random tweet from an anonymous user about one of the biggest celebrities in the world."
2197,2020-06-28 09:42:03,hfwnb5,"he won‚Äôt get any money, so there would be nothing to donate. there‚Äôs no possible way that she has enough assets to pay anything substantial, and he has no interest in keeping some rando on a restitution plan for the rest of her life

he‚Äôs using the huge amount of money to dissuade any future false accusations, force the accuser into making an apology and retraction, and make him look generous when he drops the lawsuit"
2198,2020-06-26 03:37:15,hfwnb5,"can't get blood from a stone. suing someone who makes what? $60,000/year for $20 million??. if the false accusations are false accusations, its still not a good look. Headline: ""Multi-millionaire celebrity sues low-wage worker for $20 million. Will now garnage wages FOR LIFE"" Nope. not a good look at all."
2199,2020-06-26 03:51:37,hfwnb5,it could backfire on him and make him look money hungry  (not saying it is)
2200,2020-06-26 03:44:05,hfwnb5,"ok but you literally cant sue some regular person and expect to get 20 million dollars out of them. this person could be unemployed, or work minimum wage, or part time, or be a student. even if they're working and earn the median wage of what, 50,000 a year? what's garnishing their wages going to do? how many of those team members is a % of that, after taxes, going to pay?"
2201,2020-06-26 19:04:51,hfwnb5,"the way this sub en masse has reacted to all of this is kinda disappointing to me tbh, like this isnt just a situation about revenge/karma, justin is absolutely valid in being defensive and proving his innocence but ppl here are acting like false rape accusations are equally bad as rape? people dont realize how much the system is set up against rape victims as it is, false accusations are awful but the court really doesnt take them as seriously as people seem to think - even actual rapists barely get convicted."
2202,2020-06-26 05:31:10,hfwnb5,"Right! I don't mind being downvoted or having my view changed but its seems senseless and not addressing the real issue - that it may serve as a deterrent to people speaking up.
Reading through seeing anything other than applauding him and group hate on this girl being downvoted without a discussion for the larger consequences has me confused"
2203,2020-06-26 06:32:15,hfwnb5,"Taylors situation was completely different and would be completely useless here. 

Please tell me how it would deter this girl who lied if she got to pay her measly 1 dollar, go off Scott free and so this again another time? 

The sum is so crazy because that's the whole.point of a deterrent. You're not thinking properly. Justin is worth 300 million. He doesn't need nor does he expect 20 million from this random girl. But by suing for such a huge amount (from an ordinary persons perspective anyway), he's essentially forcing her to either pay (which she can't in 6 lifetimes) or reach some.sort of settlement which would likely mean her admitting she lied and clearing his name which is what he wants. 

If a person thinks they can make harmful false allegations and only end up having to pay 1 dollar and no other consequence, that isn't gonna stop anyone."
2204,2020-06-26 06:32:43,hfwnb5,I agree. He has all the power and money in this situation. He already came forward with evidence against the claims. It seems as though a majority of people have come back to his side. I really think this is an unnecessary step.
2205,2020-06-26 08:02:57,hfwnb5,Such cases only win on court when it can be proven that she falsely and maliciously accused him. If there is any doubt about it nothing happens. Her or any other person coming forward and failing to prove it did happen isn't the same thing.
2206,2020-06-26 09:40:13,hfwnb5,Lying about sexual assault and rape is already illegal in the US because lying about a crime taking place is illegal full stop.
2207,2020-06-26 14:30:33,hfwnb5,"So I can definitely see what you mean in that this news can deter real victims in other cases to come forward. 

Justin mentioned that he‚Äôs been dealing with fake accusations his entire career. If we are assuming what he‚Äôs saying is true, the 20 million charge as a deterrent to basically tell the world ‚Äústop coming at me!‚Äù is worth it. There‚Äôs no way the girls will actually have to pay that much even if found guilty.

It‚Äôs not really his job to promote a safe environment for all possible real victims out there. He (or his team, because it wasn‚Äôt just Justin‚Äôs livelihood on the line) is concerned with making things safer for himself. In his experience and in his life, false allegations are probably a much much bigger problem than actual assault. Even if he‚Äôs innocent, he may not have such clear proof next time.

I can see why you don‚Äôt want to celebrate the situation though. Intimidating real victims is a very unfortunate side effect. I can‚Äôt really fault Justin for defending himself though, and in his position I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôd do it any differently."
2208,2020-06-26 03:23:25,hfwnb5,"Theoretically that's how it would work, but I imagine most people will only see the fact that the accuser is being sued for $20 mil. Speaking out is hard enough, but here is a concrete example of what happens when it's ""fake"" (or, as I'm sure many will take it, that you're perceived as fake). How concrete the evidence is won't matter, many victims will prob assume that the same will happen to them, regardless of the validity of their claims"
2209,2020-06-26 04:50:10,hfwnb5,"I think there‚Äôs an element of people LOVING instant karma / justice that you‚Äôre missing. For better or worse, people have made up their minds about the validity of these accusations after seeing Justin‚Äòs receipts. If it were me and I was truly innocent, I would be worried about defending myself first and foremost - so it‚Äôs understandable why he‚Äôs taking these measures."
2210,2020-06-26 06:27:59,hfwnb5,A single fake allegation that gets enough publicity can be used for years by the right to deny sexual assault and paint real victims as liars. This isn't just a one off lie situation.
2211,2020-06-26 11:50:19,hfwnb5,That's different than suing someone for millions of dollars
2212,2020-06-26 11:48:42,hfwnb5,"I'm not saying that I think he's a sexual predator, I'm saying in the event that he has assaulted people. Which I would say about anyone, regardless of the rumors surrounding them, bc you never know. And I dunno, but i would expect to merit a lawsuit of $20 mil, the damage to his reputation would have to be a bit more substantial than ""randos on the internet think he's a bad person, "" seeing as he's had to deal with that for most of his career to seemingly little financial detriment"
2213,2020-06-26 04:53:46,hfwnb5,"What‚Äôs wrong with what this rich, powerful man is doing?"
2214,2020-06-26 05:18:16,hfwnb5,this sub gets pretty iffy whenever one of their faves is involved
2215,2020-06-26 01:03:57,hfwnb5,Yeah it's not. But that's not an amount most people can pay off in their entire lifetime so I hope it doesn't come to that.
2216,2020-06-26 10:36:02,hfwnb5,"The fact that she actually deserves it for trying to ruin a person's life? You know you could apply that to any crime, right?

>""Person A got caught trying to assassinate Person B. He got caught and now Person A is going to prison, but I don't understand! Isn't Person B now guilty as well because he wants Person A's actions to have consequences!?""

Like, false accusations aren't a joke. Justin's career (AND personal life) would have taken a SERIOUS hit if it weren't for all those receipts. All because of an anonymous Twitter thread."
2217,2020-06-26 04:55:57,hfwnb5,"Spoiler, no one actually expects 20 million to come out of these girls. Also, you‚Äôre against consequences? It‚Äôs not like anyone will be in jail it‚Äôs not a criminal case"
2218,2020-06-26 02:45:57,hfwnb5,He‚Äôs not trying to get that money lol. I almost guarantee he will settle for a public apology and no money.
2219,2020-06-26 16:24:25,hfwnb5,"Its not something I'm suggesting, its something that happens as a side effect of the actions he's taking. Like it or not, it's what happens and it's a smart move on his part to protect himself. If he had multiple sexual assault allegations in the past, he just needs to choose the one where he KNOWS he'll win (because he knows he didn't do it). And once he wins it in court it will deter anyone else across the board."
2220,2020-06-26 07:32:45,hfwnb5,"False accusations and rape are **not** the same thing, and should not be treated as the same crime. There are several reasons that someone might make a false accusation (intentionally or accidentally) that would mitigate the seriousness of doing so. Someone might make a ""false"" accusation due to mistaken identity, as a cry for help, or because they made a real accusation that they were then brow beat into retracting, for example. (The Netflix series *Unbelievable* is based on a ProPublica news article about a woman who made a real accusation of rape, was convinced it never happen, and criminally charged with falsely reporting.)

In contrast, depending on the law, there's maybe one situation at best you could commit rape without specifically meaning to have sex with someone without their consent.

Also, you can take back a false accusation and take steps to repair the damage. You can't take back rape.

Genuine false accusations should have consequences, but to suggest they should be as bad as the consequences for rape is absurd imo.

edit: I guess I should have made this clearer: I am talking about the whole spectrum of false accusations, not the tiny percentage that lead to someone being falsely convicted of rape. They are very serious, and among the worst non-violent crimes you can commit. They are also worlds apart from the kind of false accusation being discussed in this thread about suing an anonymous Twitter account."
2221,2020-06-26 10:36:50,hfwnb5,This is what worries me.

2228,2020-06-26 03:19:38,hfwnb5,"My guess is what he's really aiming for is a settlement in which the accuser confesses they made the whole thing up, thereby clearing his name in full. The price tag on the lawsuit is a stick to make sure that happens.

If he went for the ""symbolic dollar"" lawsuit it would get drawn out for potentially years and with no way to recoup his mounting legal costs. He wants a confession now, while this is still on people's minds."

2230,2020-06-26 07:36:29,hfwnb5,"I know what you're getting at, but if your accuser can't afford legal fees this would be a powerful deterrent regardless of the truth. Most cases never make it to court, and the person accused usually doesn't have to submit themselves for questioning."

2232,2020-06-26 23:15:31,hfwnb5,"If it's the American legal system than the accuser could lose a lot of money paying the legal fees for a lawyer alone even if they don't lose. There's unfortunately a lot more money and corruption and otherwise brokenness in the legal system that it feels like this thread is mostly glossing over, but there is definitely a recent history of intimidation lawsuits used to shut people up even if they had no genuine legal claims so long as the person suing has more or less an infinite source of money, which most top pop stars would probably qualify as having."

2236,2020-06-26 03:10:51,hfwnb5,Uhhh that's not what simp means lol
2237,2020-06-26 20:38:53,hfwnb5,Both concern me. But the issue I pointed out particularly touches me because I lived a bad experience. No need to be angry like that
2238,2020-06-26 03:51:59,hfwnb5,"Maybe not to you, but 99.99% of ppl in the real world support it and consider it a good look. Shows theres gonna be consequences for falsely accusing someone of rape. False accusations can destroy careers and make it so much harder for actual victims to get justice. Again, Biebs won't get much, its symbolic. The wolf of wall street for example owes millions in restitution and he's made that money but as of a couple years after, he only paid like 20,000."
2239,2020-06-26 17:32:34,hfwnb5,"I mean most people will not have a problem with this, bc it stops people from falsley accusing someone."
2240,2020-06-26 03:57:31,hfwnb5,"Highly doubt that, everyone knows Biebs isnt getting the money, main reason is to show its not a joke"
2241,2020-06-26 04:07:14,hfwnb5,"He could do a public donation of those $20 million to a foundation to avoid being targeted as money hungry. It would be even better if it‚Äôs for victims of sexual assaults, it would show he‚Äôs serious about these kind of issues and he realizes most of the times those kind of accusations are real.

Edit: Even if he isn‚Äôt really getting all that money, then he could give a smaller but significant amount."
2242,2020-06-26 04:49:37,hfwnb5,But here's the thing. He's not poor or seemed to be money hungry. That's probably why people are supporting him.
2243,2020-06-26 03:59:37,hfwnb5,"A persons financial position is of no consideration when a crime is committed. Justin is using high profile smart lawyers, they know he won't be getting 20 million, if you know anything about how the law works you'll know that the amount would be settled to something more reasonable later, but to come to that point the lawyers have to sue for a ridiculous amount first. Also if the proofs would have even taken about a week or two more come , and people would have started boycotting his stuff , then the loss would be in millions , and millions more due to the tarnished reputation in the future. All in all even if this was Jeff Bezos getting sued , the lawyers won't be suddenly asking 20 billion just because he can afford that,  thats not how this works, in fact Bezos would have even higher profile lawyers who would make the settlement to me much much lower than what a lawyer a regular person can afford would be able to do."
2244,2020-06-26 19:13:48,hfwnb5,"Yes! False accusations happen dramatically less than actual rape and like you pointed out, proven sexual assaults cases still get lenient sentences or no sentences at all."
2245,2020-06-26 05:51:20,hfwnb5,"Yeah, downvotes themselves are meaningless but it's alarming to see so many people blindly supporting an action that sets a terrible precedent for future survivors speaking out against famous/rich abusers."
2246,2020-06-26 06:36:52,hfwnb5,"Yeah so youve completely missed my points Ive asked to explain being a deterrent for REAL cases

I totally agree with your comment on the 1 dollar not being enough hence my comments on a systemic change being needed."
2247,2020-06-26 09:49:56,hfwnb5,"I think the thing is too, $20 million seems excessive when rape is, as far as the legal system and law enforcement is concerned, not taken very seriously. So while suing some amount for libel or something makes sense the amount is uncomfortably disproportionate to the crime in my opinion - I also feel that it puts a lot of heavy focus on himself as a victim, which he is, but in a way that will stick to headlines for years that a smaller amount would not and give many the false impression that this is a relatively common occurrence, which is not the case. I doubt that was his intention of course and the amount was probably either something his team decided for him or more reactionary."
2248,2020-06-27 01:18:35,hfwnb5,"This is a great well thought out comment that makes me understand the situation more from Justin's point of view esp when you say in his life and his experience and the point about what if he didnt have proof! Still think it could be handled differently but I want to thank you for articulating and discussing, I definitely have a better understanding of why he feels he might need to do it and can see that something like this may be necessary if he has had repeated fake allegations!"
2249,2020-06-26 09:35:20,hfwnb5,"Yeah, I understand him receipt dumping and even suing the person, realistically if there isn't enough evidence to support that the claims were made up the accuser should theoretically be legally in the clear as well but I don't like the practice of rich people using their money in lawsuits as some fear mongering tool in general, especially towards people that cannot afford lawyers."
2250,2020-06-26 09:29:29,hfwnb5,"A single fake accusation that Justin has a reasonable amount of receipts to more or less disprove. I'm not convinced anyone that didn't already have a poor opinion of Justin believes it.

Edit: also, you will never stop assholes from lying about that kind of thing so while those people sincerely suck we really get no where if we allow them to be the reason credible accusations aren't taken seriously."
2251,2020-06-26 16:34:33,hfwnb5,">but i would expect to merit a lawsuit of $20 mil, the damage to his reputation would have to be a bit more substantial than ""randos on the internet think he's a bad person,

It's complete sheer luck that he had all the receipts to prove she was lying. If he had indeed stayed at the same hotel without his then GF, you'll all be jumping on him as if he was a rapist like people did on this very sub, when the news broke about these accusations.

If he does not sue and people learn than they can get away with making false accusations, then he may not be as lucky the next time someone else wanna try it.

Also the ¬£20m figure is completely random, defamation lawsuits are never settled for the amount the accuser asks.  He and his lawyers know this.

Edit: they are also after a retraction and apology. At this stage the anonymous person has NOT rescinded their accusations. That makea a big difference.

2262,2020-06-26 10:45:28,hfwnb5,"Not taking false allegations seriously will incentivize people making such allegations for extortion or blackmailing. People who do so have nothing to fear, because they know that they'll get away with it with just a slap on the wrist, and continue to do so elsewhere until they hit the jackpot. Also, rape allegations are not something small, alleged people end up with ruined careers, lives, families and what not. So, I think it's fair to say false accusers should have the same punishment as what could've happened to the accused if their allegations are not false. Not to mention the damage they'll be causing to the real victims, which is just horrible.  


I get your point however. Not being able to prove one's allegation beyond a doubt, is not the same as falsely alleging someone has done something. We gotta draw the line somewhere."

If a celebrity did assault someone and then sue them for an exorbitant amount of money for bringing it up they would have to prove without a questionable doubt they weren‚Äôt anywhere near the victim. And they know they did it, so they can‚Äôt do that. It‚Äôs a very specific situation and putting yourself up to commit perjury isn‚Äôt something many super rich people are gonna be willing to do not is it something their leagues of lawyers are gonna advise them to do. Justin has a team of people who know the law a hell of a lot more than you or I do and I don‚Äôt think they wouldn‚Äôt do this if it wasn‚Äôt bulletproof"
2276,2020-06-26 14:24:51,hfwnb5,People forget this tactic was also used by Michael Jackson shutting up the child molestation cases for years. The civic court is a lot lower of burden of proof and easier to silence victims through.

but these accusations rarely actually 'cancel' someone or ruin someones career lmao, and im not a fan of how many people seem to take this one case and turn it into a story about how hard the world is for men and people that get wrongfully accused - in a way that implies that its wildly common, that its equally destructive to its victims as what rape victims go through, and especially that the entire world just believes women (victims of rape/assault in general, but specifically women) at their word all the time. i wish it did, but the world **really** doesnt care as much about rape victims as these people seem to think it does."
2288,2020-06-30 06:52:44,hfwnb5,"\>proven sexual assaults cases still get lenient sentences or no sentences at all.  


You're speaking purely from ideology. Sexual assault has been taken extremely seriously in America.  


Before the reformation of the death penalty rape was punished by the electric chair in places in the south. Every single person on death row for rape in Virginia before the 1972 death penalty reformation was black. They did not view white women as legally able to consent to have sex with a black man, so aside from lynching, they would also convict men as rapists and they'd be executed. This was done on a mere whim.  


After the death penalty reformation, these places in the south gave football numbers for rape convictions. 40 years, 50 years, sometimes 60 years.  


Even now, Daniel Holtzclaw, 200+ years. They take it very seriously.  


There's a big reason that the innocence project the biggest cases are of people falsely convicted of rape, it's because it WAS taken seriously, but in the wrong way.  


I just don't know where you get ""proven cases"" get ""no sentences"" or ""lenient sentences"".   


We wouldn't have people coming out of prison crying because they served 20 years for a crime they didn't commit.  


Yes of course false accusations are much lower than real accusations, but I'm just tired of people throwing out talking points that don't match with the very brutal and nuanced history. This is complicated with mass incarceration, racism, classism and misogyny.  


On one hand you had cases like SHerly Arujo who was gang raped in a bar and the entire community vilified her and they didn't protect her identity. But you also had cases with corrupt cops, you had cases where a victim was completely unaware they accused the wrong guy and you had plain old malicious accusations. A lot of it was unequal justice meted out differently based on race and class.   


One white rich kid getting a lenient judge doesn't speak to the history and the vast majority of cases getting decades in jail."
2289,2020-06-26 12:28:36,hfwnb5,"You don't understand at all. He could provide his receipts but it'd be more effective to get a confession from the girl herself rather than just have a judge rule it. 

And I strongly disagree. Knowing that your tweet can be traced back to you, and you could be sued for millions of dollars will certainly be effective in stopping these frivolous random boys and girls thinking they can do something like this and get away with it. 

Also, you seem to not acknowledge that deterring fake accusations is important not only because it can ruin someone's life or career but because with every fake accusation it makes real victims harder to believe anyway."
2290,2020-06-26 21:04:45,hfwnb5,"Once again, you fail to come up with a consequence more serious than ""internet randos thinking he's a bad person"". I mean, just look at Chris Brown, who was criminally charged numerous times and yet still has more money than 99% of the population will ever see in their lifetime. 

Your idea of justice is crude. What will the lawsuit accomplish that the Twitter thread hasn't already? The Twitter thread was enough to clear bieber's name. Is it to prevent others from falsely accusing him? Rape is under reported. And of those are reported, less than 10% are said to be false. The average person is thus unlikely to be faced with a false allegation. While one could argue his celebrity status makes him a target for false accusations, the number of reported accusations against celebs is still very low. Is it then to deliver some idea of ""justice""? Does this punish a wrong doer? Yes. Is the punishment proportional to the crime? Will it improve the overall utility of our society? To these the answer is no. The lawsuit is ludicrous in the compensation it is asking for. The only reason for that number is to discourage others from doing the same, which is is a non issue. Bieber may get the satisfaction from winning, but this will not help the person who did this to correct their ways (many false accusations are done by people with a history of criminality and/or major issues that lead them to act out in ways like this) and it will only further scare other victims. You may argue that the accuser did this themselves by lying in the first place, but let's be honest, people will use any excuse not to believe. 


TLDR: Let's please talk about justice in all its nuances and complexity rather than just the stuff you learned about it from grade school"
2291,2020-06-26 16:49:11,hfwnb5,"Speak the truth sistah !!!

I literally died of laughter from ¬´Justin Bieber being a fave on popheads¬ª take"
2292,2020-06-26 01:34:03,hfwnb5,"> most of the time the guy gets jailed

no. very incorrect.

If a rape is reported, there is a 50.8% chance of an arrest. If an arrest is made, there is an 80% chance of prosecution. If there is a prosecution, there is a 58% chance of conviction. If there is a felony conviction, there is a 69% chance the convict will spend time in jail.

So even in the 39% of attacks that are reported to police, **there is only a 16.3% chance the rapist will end up in prison**. [Factoring in unreported rapes, about 6% of rapists will ever spend a day in jail.](https://cmsac.org/facts-and-statistics/)"
2293,2020-06-26 01:38:03,hfwnb5,this is just straight up not true lmao. im sure its more common for celebs to face but the world really doesnt care as much about rape victims as you think it does.
2294,2020-06-26 15:17:38,hfwnb5,"The crime 100% took place. The person falsely accused Bieber of something he never did that would've seriously tarnished his reputation and cost him plenty of things in life. It was a calculated attack that had plenty of people already canceling him. Now yes, 20 million is a lot but the point is that there should be a precedent set to stop people from  making serious false accusations. A serious crime isn't always something physical like rape or assault or something that is communicated personally with the victim like blackmail."

2298,2020-06-26 17:54:59,hfwnb5,"That's not at all what I said.

I said that one of the reasons for making a false accusation can be a cry for help with sexual violence from another person. It mitigates the **seriousness** of the wrong of false accusations, not the damage it does.

It's like how certain reasons for killing someone are murder (more serious), and certain are manslaughter (less serious). Both are wrong, but motivation matters. It is a bad idea to treat a rape victim like a rapist in this scenario."

2314,2020-06-26 19:29:31,hfwnb5,"I completely agree. For every false accusation there are a dozen more genuine cases that go unreported because victims feel that they won't be believed or won't get justice even if they are believed.

2315,2020-06-26 22:05:45,hfwnb5,"Me disagreeing with you is not the same as me not understanding, but thanks for the condescension. And yeah, I'm much less worried at scaring off false accusations for a few reasons. One of them being that many with *credible* accusations often become targets of harrassment or ostracism, especially, but not limited to, when the accused is a celebrity so that already scares off many accusations in general, never mind potential false ones. Two, again, though it does happen it's extremely rare and this case even being so big overblows the frequency and the $20 million only further sensationalizes it. And the fact that there's several misogynistic groups that are definitely going to use this to justify their awful beliefs towards female victims and women in general and use it to indoctrinate young and vulnerable boys/men into their grotesque ideology and view the lawsuit amount as some kind or justice porn and possibly as some form of support from Justin is even more reason that if he wants to frame himself as an ally to women and feminism that going the harshest route of punishment he could possibly go for will likely do much more harm. Three, the death penalty does nothing to prevent or notably reduce the most heinous of crimes, someone going to commit a crime likely isn't that deterred by punishment (and lying to damage a celebrities reputation is already illegal/was already punishable so that did not dissuade this person as is) and probably either just works by the assumption they'll get away with it or they just don't think about it. I'm much more worried about credible accusations being silenced by fear of hefty financial punishment from those with much more power and influence."
2316,2020-06-27 01:03:50,hfwnb5,">Is the punishment proportional to the crime?

But what punishment? You already ran the trial and concluded Justin Bieber was awarded ¬£20m?

And that's not how defamation lawsuit work. They always start with a frivolous sum. He's probably gonna settle out of court and get the liar to confess making shit up and to apologise.

Being accused of a crime you did not commit can be extremely traumatising. He's extremely lucky he got the receipts.  Justin Bieber is the victim here and if you don't believe he should get justice, then you are not after justice. I don't even need to TLDR this."

If I save for 30 years, that gives me about $128k. After saving $110k myself. Of course I'll probably be able to save more per month eventually, but even so, the relative rate at which it increases in the end will be fairly small."
2320,2020-06-26 05:50:49,hfwnb5,"That‚Äôs basically the primary function of bankruptcy. If you owe $10m and you‚Äôre on anywhere near a normal person‚Äôs salary it‚Äôs extremely easy to file because it‚Äôs obvious you‚Äôll never ever pay that back.

The downside is your credit is basically fucked forever and there are certain other restrictions (almost always to do with finance, obviously) that might apply to ex-bankrupts depending on local laws."

And even if we suppose that's how much of his income/future income that was affected/lost (which let's be real, it isn't since he's already aligned himself as pretty anti-feminist when he came out to praise/support Chris Brown and was essentially accused of emotionally abusing Selena and still has not lost a significant amount of support so I'm not convinced this would have had that much of an affect on his popularity) no one *needs* $10-$20 million so I fail to see or understand in what world it's fair.

2389,2020-06-25 16:55:29,hfndof,"I'm a massive Gucci fan, so I'm obviously biased. However, I would rank this fairly high amongst his post-prison albums, with my only complaint being the length and overuse of features. It's the same issue that plagued *Mr. Davis*, an album that I felt had good intentions but ended up being way overstuffed.

Gucci's rapping sounds sharp here, and focused. However, in my opinion, his sleekest rapping post-prison has been on *Evil Genius* where he fully embraced the dark grittiness of some of his earlier material without sacrificing radio appeal. Songs like ""Bussdown"" ""Special"" ""ICE"" and ""Making of a Murderer"" showcase that Gucci can still stand neck and neck lyrically with all of the best trap artists working today.

Honestly, I have always felt that Gucci is at his best when he is straightforward. Give me those creative, tongue-twisting street raps with some banging production and maybe a guest verse from a likeminded rapper (Waka, Thug, Lil Baby, Gunna, etc....please no more R&B features). This formula is so simple but it always works for Gucci. I understand he has to experiment a bit, but it almost always falls flat for me. ""Love Thru the Computer"" is an earnest but boring collaboration with Justin Bieber, while ""Blind"" features an awesome Gucci verse on what is otherwise an A Boogie throwaway.

This album needed to be cut down to 12-14 songs, there's no reason for an 18 track Gucci Mane album to exist and this is coming from a huge fan. That being said, ""Proud of You"" is one of my favorite Gucci songs ever, I hope he works with Kenny Beats more in the future. I would give this a 7/10."
2390,2020-06-25 16:13:04,hfndof,"I actually really enjoyed this album. It was good for what it is. The kenny production on this was fire - US and Proud of You are bangers. I wish he would get more solid features like on Mr Davis more often cause it definitely elevates his music. I even thought the Bieber feature on this was solid. He also needs to realize that he should cut the number of songs on each of his albums cause he puts out wayyy too much.

I‚Äôd give this a 6.5/10. I revisit some of the songs often"
2391,2020-06-25 20:35:08,hfndof,"I liked most of Guwop's post prison output but I didn't fuck with this too much, and neither with his 2 other albums from last year. Maybe I'm just growing tired of him, but this album was definitely way too long to enjoy. I think Mr.Davis and Evil Genius are some recent instances where he could pull off making a long album, and the few filler tracks weren't as annoying. The Justin single on here was terrible as well. 

I'm actually glad Gucci's dropped nothing this year and hopefully he'll be a bit more focused with his album making this time around. I think he can bounce back.

I'd give this like a 4.5/10. Favourite tracks: Proud of You, Making of a Murderer, Backwards."

My man releasing way too much material without trimming it down is kinda Gucci's thing lol. Pretty sure State Vs Radric Davis was also 18-20 tracks and let's not forget shit like the WW3 triple release or Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner. I'm a big fan but ""quality control"" is not really Gucci's strong suit."
2393,2020-06-25 22:08:45,hfndof,"I think you summed it up well and 'Proud of You' goes hard asf 

*""No lean and mountain dew, Guwop i'm so proud of you""*

I think this album really reflects how much Gucci has grown and how he takes things more seriously these days - the man has a physique like a god"
2394,2020-06-25 20:55:48,hfndof,"As weird as it might sound, ""happy Gucci"" is a little harder to get into. When he was directly post prison he had a lot to prove now that the artists he'd co-signed were bigger than he was and coke-rap was pretty much passe, plus showing the world that he wasn't the same incoherent fat mess he was when he went in. 

A few years in and he's successful, sober, married, just turned 40 and a well-respected legend in the game. It's not too surprising his output starts to feel like he's coasting along. Em showed it when he had the same thing happen, artists who blow up as troubled people coming from chaos lose a lot of their spark when they finally get some stability in their lives, even if their technical ability is better than ever."
2395,2020-06-25 20:45:39,hfndof,"I don‚Äôt agree, while that has been his thing in the past, Droptopwop was ten quality songs with no filler and a lot of his other post prison albums have been pretty lean. It actually works better for him that way imo."
2396,2020-06-25 20:57:37,hfndof,"Fair point, he's been better at it post-prison. It's just still something I kinda expect from him."

Even just allegations have a huge impact on someone. Even after the allegations are proven false it still follows a person because there will always be people that will side with a ""victims"" claims even if they admitted to lying."
2467,2020-06-30 15:21:23,hiovl4,">A study made by the U.S. Department of Justice of prison releases in 1992, involving about 80 percent of the prison population, found that the average sentence for convicted rapists was 9.8 years, while the actual time served was 5.4 years.

That sounds fair, plus placement on the sex offender registry when they get out."
2468,2020-06-30 15:03:24,hiovl4,I believe they should be given equal treatment as actual rapists. Same punishment and everything. It‚Äôs just as fucked up to falsely accuse someone of rape as it is to actually rape someone.

The man can serve time in prison, have difficulty getting a job, and looked at as a sex offender by their peers. When proven in court that the woman falsely accused the man, that woman should now owe 50% of all current and future assets to that man. Whatever money she makes, whatever that woman owns, half of it is legally the man's. That woman is now permanently indebted to that man. If the woman's mother died, and the mother left all her assets to the woman, half of it is now the man's."

2476,2020-06-30 15:20:52,hiovl4,"You‚Äôve got to be a total and complete moron if you think social damage to your reputation is as bad as the physical/psychological trauma of having something repeatedly shoved inside you against your will (as well as the social damage when half the population assumes you‚Äôre just lying to ruin a man‚Äôs life). Both are very serious issues that cause damage. It‚Äôs fucked up to falsely accuse, and it‚Äôs more fucked up to actually rape someone. Acting like they‚Äôre they same when they‚Äôre not just makes people not take it seriously instead of addressing the issue."
2477,2020-06-30 15:03:21,hiovl4,"In prison, the ranking for most hated and most likely to get attacked prisoners are (1) child molesters, and (2) sexual assault convicts.  

What if the innocent guy was shanked while awaiting trial?"
2478,2020-06-30 15:07:38,hiovl4,"Idk, they ran the risk of sending an innocent person to jail as a skinner (what we call people who commit sexual assaults). Skinners are the lowest of the low in the jail system. they have to go protective custody because general population will either assault or kill them. 

So should they go to basically a fenceless, gateless jail, nah. They should experience what they were trying to put someone else through. Couple months in a medium security jail."
2479,2020-06-30 16:01:17,hiovl4,"Extreme, but understandable.  The accusations alone can ruin someones entire life.  You almost need to woman to be convicted in court for falsely claiming rape in order to restore your reputation."
2480,2020-06-30 15:15:13,hiovl4,"Lol no, most rapists who are charged end up pleading down to probation, a few months in jail, or a few years at most if there are multiple victims. It is very rare that a rapist ever gets more than 8 years. Weinstein twitter trends don‚Äôt represent the majority population."
2481,2020-06-30 15:44:55,hiovl4,"I‚Äôm not implying that either aren‚Äôt a serious issue. Ofc rape is a fucked up issue but you‚Äôve got to understand a man can lose just abt their whole life and possibly go to prison over a false accusation. Yes it‚Äôs definitely more fucked up to actually rape someone and I‚Äôm not defending rapists at all or saying it‚Äôs not absolutely disgusting and fucked up in every way imaginable to rape someone. But false accusations should be taken as seriously as an actual rape, not only because it can destroy someone‚Äôs life but it discredits other real and serious accusations of ppl who have be actually raped"
2482,2020-06-30 15:23:26,hiovl4,"Of course they are not the same.  And that's not what I said.  I asked if we should automatically believe all woman?

Edit: clarification"
2483,2020-06-30 15:04:21,hiovl4,I wasn‚Äôt aware that people were put in prison before a trial
2484,2020-06-30 15:09:49,hiovl4,"1 is right number 2 is wrong. For some it was their initiation into the gang. 

Source: worked in one of the largest prisons."
2485,2020-06-30 16:07:00,hiovl4,"This way the woman stays out of prison, and the man is supported for his ruined reputation."
2486,2020-06-30 15:21:41,hiovl4,"I think couple years is still better, punishments should be disincentive"
2487,2020-06-30 15:57:32,hiovl4,‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just as fucked up to falsely accuse someone of rape as it is to actually rape someone‚Äù This was the statement I was disputing in your other comment. I agree with everything you said in this comment.
2488,2020-06-30 15:26:38,hiovl4,My reply wasn‚Äôt to you
2489,2020-06-30 15:06:40,hiovl4,"They go to jail.  Not as dangerous, but attacks still happen"
2490,2020-06-30 15:13:05,hiovl4,"Thats just from what Ive heard multiple times.  But since this is coming straight from the horses mouth, I stand corrected.  They cant be far back thou?"
2491,2020-06-30 19:50:26,hiovl4,"People have died over false rape accusations, by their own hands and the hands of others. ""B-but it's just your reputation brooo""."
2492,2020-06-30 15:33:09,hiovl4,Ah sorry.
2493,2020-06-30 17:12:21,hiovl4,"Lets put it this way one of the ""leaders"" was in for raping his 12 yr old sister. Not step sister and it was violent. It does depend on the ""block"" and gang in charge of that ""block"" side  note: they dont straight up beat pedophiles, they charge them ""rent"" (honey buns, cigarettes, holding a stash) if they dont pay rent thats when bad things happen. Its definitely not a world anyone should want to be a part of."
2494,2020-06-30 22:34:18,hiovl4,"By that logic, people have also died by having their nudes leaked, being bullied, falling into financial ruin, being dumped, etc. Doesn‚Äôt mean any of it is *as bad* as being raped, anyone with even a basal level of psychological background would know that."
2495,2020-07-10 21:21:02,hiovl4,"Ok then, why not? To play devil's advocate, what makes rape so uniquely traumatic?"
2496,2020-07-13 09:02:50,hiovl4,"Are you fucking dumb? The human body is the only thing that is ever truly yours. Your parents, your siblings, your friends, your lovers, your hobbies, and your possessions are all temporary and conditional. Your body is the only thing you truly own, whats yours from birth to death. The body is the only thing a person has complete and total freedom over. That is why the psyche (or what religious people call a soul) has such a deep (biological) connection with the body, whether people are aware or not. So when that body is grossly violated, it is psychologically damaging to the point that it rivals the damage of those who have seen war (evidence of PTSD for rape victims is well documented). It can also be physically damaging to the point where someone can no longer have children, can no longer have sex, or they develop a fistula that leads to incontinence. It‚Äôs beyond hurt feelings and a ruined reputation, it causes immense suffering akin to torture, which is why it is used as a weapon of war to commit genocide."

apart from that, it seems more like a gossip website than reputable source"
2499,2020-06-30 14:07:05,hinwr1,Great to see Knuckles get into the game finally.
2500,2020-06-30 14:14:01,hinwr1,Season 17 is turning out to be quite the mediocre season.
2501,2020-06-30 14:04:18,hinwr1,"Man, this season's Spotlight Pass is bumming me out! Decent amount of genre variety, but...the songs aren't the best representatives from each genre, we'll just leave it at that.

The Neon Trees song is okay, I guess."
2502,2020-06-30 14:07:20,hinwr1,Bieber's back in Rock Band after 4 years? Oooooh boy. Can't wait to see the comments in this thread!
2503,2020-06-30 14:20:29,hinwr1,The Neon Trees track actually sounds pretty good considering I hate everything else I‚Äôve heard by this band
2504,2020-06-30 17:50:32,hinwr1,I like how the name Bieber is what's setting y'alls salt off when he's barely even recognizable as a feature in this pop-country thing. I've incidentally heard this song a dozen times and had no idea he's even involved
2505,2020-06-30 14:21:51,hinwr1,"Super happy i didnt spend money on the Pass. Again a song i would never play more than once by myself. Neon Trees song sounds okay though, gonna have to listen the whole song if its worth the investment."
2506,2020-06-30 14:10:32,hinwr1,"I'm here to read how ""hardcore"" players complain about Bieber"
2507,2020-06-30 18:54:13,hinwr1,The Neon Trees song is solid definitely worth 1.49. Hard pass on the other atrocity of a song
2508,2020-06-30 14:07:26,hinwr1,I'm starting to really hate the Spotlight passes.  There's just no good solution to deciding whether to buy it or not if you're playing Rivals.
2509,2020-06-30 16:38:42,hinwr1,"Im fine with pop, but we have so many better choices like ‚ÄòSay So‚Äô by Doja Cat, ‚ÄòBurnin‚Äô Up‚Äô by Jonas Brothers, anything from Ariana Grande, the unreleased ‚ÄòParty In The USA‚Äô by Miley Cyrus."
2510,2020-07-01 07:57:23,hinwr1,"I really love these song choices, but I‚Äôm not loving how HMX is using a lot of Green-Orange chords in guitar when their rules stated to limit them."
2511,2020-06-30 15:12:44,hinwr1,"Out of the 10 songs this season, I've only bought 3. This week is just bland.

Neon Trees - Sounds alright but the guitar chart looks pretty meh. 

Justin Bieber - No. That is all!"
2512,2020-06-30 15:15:09,hinwr1,"More Neon Trees is a nice day-late birthday gift!

Bieber...not so much."
2513,2020-07-02 05:47:22,hinwr1,I heard this Neon Trees song a while ago and actually kinda dug it and was wondering if it‚Äôd get into Rock Band. Looks like my question has been answered
2514,2020-07-03 20:01:02,hinwr1,"Why is ""Used to Like"" Alternative when the rest of Neon Trees is Pop Rock?  It sounds exactly like all of their other songs."
2515,2020-06-30 16:53:48,hinwr1,"My friends, family and I love pop, but there‚Äôs so much more fun choices that could have been picked."
2516,2020-07-01 01:15:21,hinwr1,God. This for sure solidifies not buying the spotlight pass anymore.
2517,2020-07-01 04:04:41,hinwr1,"The season has been really disappointing. No real Highlights compared to the previous season. Hoping in the next 3 weeks we get some Killers or if we're getting 2019 tunes, stuff from acts like Silversun Pickups and Interpol."
2518,2020-06-30 14:48:48,hinwr1,Uh oh... Bieber! Welp I was hoping for more pop but not this. At least the first song sounds decent.
2519,2020-06-30 15:08:50,hinwr1,"Another week with two garbage songs, keep the streak."

2521,2020-06-30 18:30:50,hinwr1,"10k hours is a vocal rip off of true colors. Same with the wiz Kalifa song in the past. I hate this trend of ripping off famous vocal melodies because no one else seems to even notice it. 

Happening way too often lately."
2522,2020-06-30 18:54:46,hinwr1,It's a shame that this dumpster fire of a Spotlight Pass may spell the end of Rock Band 4 support. I assume Harmonix will go into full Fuser-mode soon and this season pass was basically the nail in the coffin.
2523,2020-07-01 02:14:05,hinwr1,"Pre-rona we playedregular huge parties and were the exception in not enjoying the hardcore metal or tougher stuff and instead loving all the pop and singable karaoke stuff. 

Even this is too much for me... yikes."
2524,2020-06-30 14:13:11,hinwr1,"Despite this week featuring a whopping four artists, they have collectively done less bad than last week's one new artist. Already a massive improvement!"
2525,2020-06-30 14:46:22,hinwr1,What are you talking about? I've been playing since the original GH on PS2!
2526,2020-06-30 18:07:33,hinwr1,Does this mean I need to dig out the old Sega Genesis cartridge for the full DLC experience?
2527,2020-07-04 02:09:48,hinwr1,I totally lost interest when I saw the season rewards.  I've barely played at all this season.
2528,2020-06-30 14:19:36,hinwr1,"Yea, especially compared to the Bieber"
2529,2020-06-30 19:03:46,hinwr1,"I‚Äôd rather be getting the songs from Fuser at this point. Or even the songs from Audica, like G.O.A.T"

2531,2020-06-30 14:10:57,hinwr1,I never bought them myself. Not worth the gamble. Storage space on consoles is a commodity these days and I'd rather not be forced to clutter my library with songs I don't even want.
2532,2020-06-30 14:21:14,hinwr1,My theory is that each week of a season (starting with Season 17) will have a 25% off song and that is the new spotlight. As a result buying all the new spotlight songs will be equivalent to the price of having bought a spotlight pass at the same price as the Season 11 and 12 spotlight passes.
2533,2020-06-30 16:28:44,hinwr1,"It's best not to  buy them, not worth the price. Just pick and choose the dlc you want"
2534,2020-06-30 20:41:57,hinwr1,"There is a good solution. A *perfect* solution, in fact.

Just don't buy it. Why would you? So you save a buck or two and get roped into supporting HMX no matter what they release? That's a bad deal. Just buy the songs you want. You only have to buy the Spotlight Songs for like 1 or 2 weeks to get Bloodstone anyway.

Honestly this game would've been much healthier right now if the player base just bought songs they liked, instead of buying into Pass culture just to seem hip and cool and sanctimoniously pretend to support the devs.

Just buy the songs you like, and everyone will be happy :)"
2535,2020-07-02 02:33:46,hinwr1,">their rules stated to limit them

Is this true?  I feel like G/O chords are just thrown in a lot of the time to make things overly difficult moreso than actually making sense with the rest of the chart.  I could also feel that way because I suck at the game, but that's neither here nor there!"
2536,2020-06-30 14:19:02,hinwr1,"Music is still about as good as it ever was, but I agree that Rock Band DLC doesn't always reflect that.

The difference between getting older and newer songs as DLC is that when we get old songs, we get the classics. Those that have stood the test of time, and are still culturally relevant. The shittier or more forgettable tracks from those eras are no longer on anyone's minds, which is why no one bothers to license them.

When it comes to new songs, Harmonix doesn't always pick from the cream of the crop. A lot of what we've gotten in terms of 2018-2020 DLC are songs that will be mostly forgotten in 5-10 years.

I know music is subjective, and most of what we get has a fanbase. But I hope that in the future, they make more of an effort to pay attention to things like critical reception when licensing tracks that aren't ""hits"", to ensure that the DLC we're getting has more staying power, and is actually relevant or respected down the road.

If they prefer to target the cheaper, unknown or ""flash-in-the-pan"" songs, at least go after those that are suitable for Rock Band. So much of the DLC we've gotten lately (that isn't from the RBN) has lacked guitars, uses electronic drum loops, has long pauses where certain instruments have nothing (or very little) to do.

There are plenty of new songs that fall under pop, indie/alternative, etc., that would still make for active charts that employ mostly real instruments. And if in the year 2030, I'm playing an obscure or mediocre song that nobody remembers or cares about, I at least want to have fun doing so."
2537,2020-07-01 03:38:10,hinwr1,"For the most part, yes this is correct. But with all things there are exceptions."
2538,2020-07-01 00:50:16,hinwr1,Buy me the next one if you're wrong?
2539,2020-07-01 05:21:55,hinwr1,"Nobody knows whether Fuser will sell at all with its steep price or not. We're living in a world where people kinda do not wanna pay for music anymore. Fuser could have mass appeal as free-to-play game, but I highly doubt millions of people are willing to pay full price anymore.

I myself might pick it up at half price, but the graphics just look way too dated to convince me to go preorder it."

2549,2020-07-02 02:50:55,hinwr1,"Interesting.  Did those rules for RBN charters actually apply to the non-RBN songs as well?  I wonder.

As an example of a recent release, I think Born To Be Wild has some G/O chords that don't really fit to me, if I remember right."
2550,2020-06-30 14:37:03,hinwr1,"What does Thomas Rhett have to do with this? He's been a headlining solo country act for years now, and as far as I know has never been part of a duo or group. Also, he's had 15 #1 songs on the Country Airplay charts over the last seven years, it's not like he just had his first hit."
2551,2020-07-02 03:12:24,hinwr1,"From what I remember, those documents were their internal guidelines made public. But it does appear as if Rock Band 4 has changed some of their guidelines, due to the fact that they will use songs without separated stem now."

2556,2020-06-30 03:18:17,hiermo,"Yeah, I made a post about it too. People are scared to compare between them but I think they're no different. When Austin Jones was first accused of being a pedophile, because of the twerking videos, he said its ""just a joke haha"" ""it would be so funny if you twerk!!"".
In his apology video, he also brings up his mental health. Austin was very smart, and extremely manipulative. 
I think Shane has mastered the art of ""no it's just a joke"". He always had a very young, and loyal fanbase, so anyone who dared to speak out against him was flooded with hate. And many forgive him because of his mental health excuses. 

Shane is much more smarter than Austin Jones, because he has been called out several times and his fanbase still followed him blindly. 
Austin used his power to manipulate fans, Shane uses his power to manipulate mainly those around him, and then his audience. 
Shane did it perfectly, he changed his content, made a new channel (in my opinion, to hide his disgusting past) and developed this ""uwu I'm so fragile"" persona. Even now fans are worrying about him, despite everything they've seen."
2557,2020-06-30 03:52:21,hiermo,"Just to clarify some things: [Austin Jones went to prison due to two instances of √ßp that involved nudity, NOT because of the dancing videos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Jones_(musician)?wprov=sfti1), which were still gross considering their ages and how he manipulated them. Think about TikTok: the amount of underage people doing dances that definitely toe the line of being wildly inappropriate. Not shaming, just saying it‚Äôs legal even if it doesn‚Äôt feel like it.

For Shane to get charged pressed against him  he would have had to produce some form of media with nudity in it. Being hella creepy is still legal."
2558,2020-06-30 05:51:11,hiermo,"I find the Austin jones comparisons to be disingenuous. Austin did not go to prison for the twerking videos. He went to prison because he had nude images of children. 

Also Shane is creepy as fuck and I‚Äôm not defending him but it‚Äôs not true in the slightest Austin went to jail over twerking videos"
2559,2020-06-30 03:24:39,hiermo,"He probably did it in public so that be could get away with it and say ‚Äúit was for shock!‚Äù Whereas if he did it in private and things got leaked, he‚Äôd go to prison."
2560,2020-06-30 07:25:27,hiermo,"Oh my gosh its really hit mainstream media www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/style/shane-dawson-jeffree-star-youtube.amp.html This isn't quite what J* was imagining when he said that he and Shane ""made such magic together. We are our own superstars, in our own lane"". J* said he was also in the middle of writing his biography. ü•¥"
2561,2020-06-30 05:37:05,hiermo,"Right now its not good to label anyone criminal. Altho it walks that fine line of legal and illegal.

The grave problem I see is that he might have created content for people who took his jokes at face value and found validation about their behavior/desires because they see it being popular with kids. 

Forums have been cracked down in the past that didn't contain actual nudity but the context surrounding the childrens photos were sexually suggestive in nature. And these were just random photos they took from facebook and formed a discussion around their fantasies about the kids. It's sick shit. 

Idk where Shane's video actually falls in that category. Comedians are the first ones to yell freedom of speech but I don't see any mainstream comic defending Shane."
2562,2020-06-30 12:49:13,hiermo,Lets not do this. Shane made a series of horrible inappropriate jokes but it is no where near as bad as *actual* pedophile Austin Jones who got 10 years in jail for making children send him sexually explicit videos.
2563,2020-06-30 10:42:39,hiermo,There might be enough evidence for a search warrant maybe... then if they find other stuff.... it will truly be game over for Shane. This goes beyond just getting canceled.
2564,2020-06-30 15:34:17,hiermo,Not even the same. Austin was privately messaging under age girls and collecting videos pictures. That means he has possession of cp which is illegal. I urge you to delete this because its terrible that you would associate the two when they're widely different. Shane is a victim of what happened to him as a child. He probably hasn't sought the right therapy. Its obvious he used to use dark humor and shock value to cope with his own problems. You're creating a worse situation by contributing to this false narrative. Things hes done and said have been bad but accusing someone of being a pedophile is a huge accusation that can ruin someone's life and even potentially lead to self harm. I would really take that into consideration before you start contributing to the bullying of a person online.
2565,2020-06-30 03:26:20,hiermo,"The fact that he‚Äôs gotten so ridiculously famous on youtube, especially compared to Austin, shows how much smarter he is and how he knows how to play the game. It‚Äôs why many famous people happen to turn out to be pedophiles. They‚Äôre smart; how do you think they got so famous in the first place?"
2566,2020-06-30 03:28:49,hiermo,"Yeah I agree. I mean it wasn't a one time joke or anything. Why is it that in even recent videos, he seems obsessed with kids (like Jojo Siwa, hiring a child to play his son, etc)? I just think there's something darker happening here and his wellbeing shouldn't be the focus right now. I'm sure his childhood trauma plays a part, but I'd guess that many people serving time right now for similar actions have a similar past. He needs to face harsh consequences, imagine how many young people have actually felt violated by him. What about them?"

2568,2020-06-30 04:02:22,hiermo,Thank you for the clarification.
2569,2020-06-30 03:31:39,hiermo,"Yeah agreed, he probably subconsciously normalized it and made it into a joke so people would just assume its fine and he wouldn't feel internally guilty."
2570,2020-06-30 03:30:06,hiermo,"Austin never touched anyone, and yet, I don't think it changes the fact that he's a pedophile and is very clearly attracted to kids. This case was so big, I wouldn't be surprised if Shane learned to hide his disgusting fetishes better. 
He has talked about looking up CP twice, and once admitted to having CP on his computer, I don't know if it's a ""joke"" but it's extremely suspicious and should be looked into."
2571,2020-06-30 03:32:49,hiermo,"The issue is that despite the evidence, fans say that for proof someone needs to come forward. But I think if there are victims out there, they're too scared to speak up."
2572,2020-06-30 06:51:06,hiermo,Which video?
2573,2020-06-30 03:32:21,hiermo,"He‚Äôs a sex-obsessed, porn-addicted depraved man. He sexualizes anything and everything, when he sees a kid or an animal or practically anything his mind jumps to sex. 

So I would be surprised if he *didn‚Äôt* have bestiality or child porn on his computer or at least watched it in private before."

2575,2020-06-30 21:11:31,hiermo,"Seen it. I already know, I‚Äôve seen most of all of Shane‚Äôs videos. I‚Äôve been a fan for a long time and still am. I just know the guy isn‚Äôt a good guy."
2576,2020-06-30 21:13:51,hiermo,"How can you justify supporting someone that has shown child predation, has sexually exploited minors and sexualised minors too?"
2577,2020-06-30 21:17:12,hiermo,"Don‚Äôt support or like the guy. I mostly watch him because I can‚Äôt let go of my attachment to him when I was a 13 year old learning about sex from him. He‚Äôs like a trainwreck and I can‚Äôt look away. It‚Äôs the same reason people on gurugossip liked to watch him: to snark. I was on that forum since 2017 and went through all the stuff from 2014 and people brought up ALL these clips that are coming out from Shane, and I remember it being drama on the forum and we were mad that everyone praised Shane. Now people are seeing the truth and it‚Äôs funny to watch all these hypocritical people."
2578,2020-06-30 21:31:04,hiermo,"I can understand watching for the train wreck and the hypocrisy, I'm seeing a lot of that happening, in the past few days, I only started watching Shane in about 2018, only really watched the spooky boys and the conspiracy videos, and finally unsubscribed after it came out he'd been over at trisha paytas.

But if you know he's bad, you know he deserves to be called out and you're here for the train wreck why still call yourself a fan? That would imply an admiration and want to support him."
2579,2020-06-30 21:32:26,hiermo,I call myself a fan in that I watch all his videos and still enjoy them from time to time.

2593,2020-07-01 00:44:10,hi6zng,"The only guy on your list I'm kinda meh about is Austin Nola.  He's a nice role player but I don't think he hits same handed pitching well enough to move the needle outside of the small platoon and isn't a very advanced catcher.  He's a nice addition to the vs. LHP lineup and they can put him at 1B if White needs a day off, or 2B/3B although I think they have better subs there in Gordon, Moore, and Lopes.  Anyway, he's cool but I think I'd go with one of Lopes, Brennan, Fraley, or Moore over him."
2594,2020-06-30 19:03:05,hi6zng,"Ah, I did make a small error. And it's fixed now."
2595,2020-06-30 19:05:38,hi6zng,"Who do u like instead?  Without thinking about it too much I say Austin Adams, but since we're talking down the road it's a tough exercise that I dont have the mental energy to spare for atm."
2596,2020-06-30 20:22:45,hi6zng,"That's fine, and this is just for a 2021 scenario and potentially a realistic fiction book."
2597,2020-06-29 19:25:10,hi4zrt,"They've added a rule against hate speech that ""doesn't apply to majority groups"".  Of course, it applies to women, who are the majority.  So they don't literally mean majority, they mean the progressive stack.  Reddit's rules now run on the basis of oppression score."
2598,2020-06-29 20:54:15,hi4zrt,"I would drop this steaming turd of a website in two seconds flat for an alternative with a no-hate-speech rule that doesn't carve out progressive stack exceptions.  It's great to shut the far right down, but it's time we shut the dirtbag left down as well.

Remember the human\*.

(\*) Does not apply to people who the far left deems subuman."
2599,2020-06-29 18:31:42,hi4zrt,"If you are going to ban subreddits, do so without bias, like how Reddit banned r/The_Donald and r/ChapoTrapHouse."
2600,2020-06-29 20:53:45,hi4zrt,"I have not frequented T_D. Was it that bad?

> Mr. Huffman said users on ‚ÄúThe_Donald‚Äù had frequently violated its first updated rule: ‚ÄúRemember the human.‚Äù He said he and others at Reddit repeatedly attempted to reason with moderators of ‚ÄúThe_Donald,‚Äù who run the subreddit on a volunteer basis, to no avail. Banning the forum was a last-ditch effort to contain harassment, he said.

> ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve given them many opportunities to be successful,‚Äù Mr. Huffman said. ‚ÄúThe message is clear that they have no intention of working with us.‚Äù

Do I understand this correctly? They change the rules on a Monday and on that same Monday they delete T_D for violating those brand new rules?

By all means ban subs that break the rules. Why was T_D not deleted for rule violations earlier if it is the case they break reddit rules? If reddit rules were insufficient, by all means adjust them and insist on T_D following them from that point on.

But this kind of one-two punch tastes of injustice. If you get kicked out of a bar over a half full drink because someone just scribbled a rule on a chalkboard that says ""no entry with adidas shoes combined with poloshirts as of 11.19 p.m."" that's just a thinly veiled disguise of ""we don't like your kind in here, gtfo no refunds""."
2601,2020-06-29 18:32:28,hi4zrt,Pushing them out into the wild again?  Lovely.
2602,2020-06-30 04:00:50,hi4zrt,"No, it doesn't apply to women. r/gendercritical was banned. We can't be critical of men who say they are women anymore."
2603,2020-06-29 21:31:59,hi4zrt,"I'm of the opinion that rules for things like hate speech should be a community level decision, not a platform level decision.  Lean towards free speech as a principle, and keeping the people who need to be contained in containment boards as a practicality."
2604,2020-06-30 00:47:43,hi4zrt,"> It's great to shut the far right down, but it's time we shut the dirtbag left down as well.

They banned Chapo Trap House as well."
2605,2020-06-29 21:49:07,hi4zrt,t\_d has apparently been dead for many months.  They've already moved on.  That's why we're not noticing the same hate flood that happened when fatpeoplehate was banned some years ago.
2606,2020-06-30 04:16:27,hi4zrt,"Like I said, progressive stack.  Trans outranks cis.  If gendercritical were devoted just to hating cisgender men, they'd be fine."
2607,2020-06-29 21:47:56,hi4zrt,"I'm not.  I have yet to come across any kind of quality discourse where hate speech has been necessary to express any sort of useful ideas.  Reddit has clearly been a breeding ground for turds of all political stripes, so it would be nice if whatever replaces it (a man can dream) could prevent those turds from taking root in the first place.

Edit:  Also, reddit is, in some senses, one big community.  It would be one thing if each subreddit required its own registration, but as it stands, anyone with a reddit account can seep out of a shithole and contaminate another sub."
2608,2020-06-30 01:58:28,hi4zrt,"Banning one sub isn't going to shut down the dirtbag left, particularly if the ""remember the human"" rule excludes some people from being human."
2609,2020-06-29 23:28:25,hi4zrt,That's a relief.
2610,2020-06-30 04:38:31,hi4zrt,"Yep, real progressive like Iran pushing homosexuals into gender reassignment surgery."
2611,2020-06-30 02:35:18,hi4zrt,"I remember the good old days of ""go back to /pol/!""

It MOSTLY worked, unlike what we've got right now."
2612,2020-06-30 02:12:25,hi4zrt,"You seem to be suggesting there is some unfairness in the bans Reddit has implemented, but I don't see it. They've banned the most prominent right-wing and left-wing shitposting subs."
2613,2020-06-29 23:39:13,hi4zrt,"Yes and no.  t\_d had been breaking reddit's sitewide rules since the beginning, and should have been banned years ago.  They've done a lot of damage that could have been prevented."
2614,2020-06-30 02:13:14,hi4zrt,"Here's my main point, in bold:

I would drop this steaming turd of a website in two seconds flat for an  alternative with **a no-hate-speech rule that doesn't carve out progressive stack exceptions**."
2615,2020-06-30 02:33:09,hi4zrt,"The problem as a whole is that Reddit has been pretty lax on stopping using the platform as a launching pad for various forms of activism. To me that seems to be one of the big concerns they're addressing here, although they're clumsy...or obscurant enough to not actually acknowledge it. 

That's my understanding of why CTH got the boot, is that the mods were doing nothing to stop/prevent brigading. The weird thing is that the CTH subreddit isn't even the commonly accepted community for that podcast...it's Stupididpol. 

And I have a distaste for that sort of internet activism, but way back when it was super common. Bloggers all over the political spectrum would direct their fanbases at things like online polls and message boards. The conventional wisdom for this really didn't change up until GamerGate, to be blunt. Probably a matter of whose ax was now being gored."
2616,2020-06-30 02:17:26,hi4zrt,"Oh OK, I get now that you're referring to the rule against hate speech not protecting people in majority groups. That wasn't mentioned in the post, so didn't realize that was part of this. And yeah, I agree that that is stupid."
2617,2020-06-30 02:24:42,hi4zrt,"Honestly, IMO the banning of t\_d was too little too late, since it essentially disbanded months ago and they've been breaking sitewide rules since 2015, and I have a sneaking suspicion that part of the reason they axed chapo was so they could seem even-handed (nevertheless, I won't miss it)."
2618,2020-06-30 02:43:12,hi4zrt,"They also banned GenderCritical, which was also a shithole leftist sub.

Two active subs vs one dead one seems to be pretty even handed to me."
2619,2020-06-30 04:18:23,hi4zrt,How many times does this guy have to say his argument has nothing to do with a measuring contest of how many subs on which side of the aisle got banned?

We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

2710,2020-08-19 08:59:31,icjfg7,This movie has zero non nepos. Whom will they blame? I am curious to see how soon it reaches the number one position.
2711,2020-08-19 10:19:47,icjfg7,Alia gets so pressed at a few üêç & 'nepo kid' in her comment section. I wonder how she's feeling now.

2718,2020-08-19 10:43:14,icjfg7,Baby has more likes (also views) than dislikes eventhough the dislike number is pretty high the same thing can‚Äôt be said for sadak2 trailer though.
2719,2020-08-19 14:59:43,icjfg7,It also has the highest dislikes to likes percentages! LMAOOOOO. It‚Äôs all in the seemingly small victories!
2720,2020-08-19 18:13:59,icjfg7,Oh god now Pooja will come out with statements like Justin has the most disliked video too but look at him he is a global star lolol

2727,2020-08-19 18:21:49,icjfg7,Question : How does YouTube payment work?  I thought they were paid by the number of views. Does the number of dislike alter the payment?

The boycott should ideally affect her as she won‚Äôt be a bankable star and brands may drop her. She will still have releases but won‚Äôt be able to wriggle her way into every damned film with a good script/big budget.

2754,2020-08-19 09:06:05,icjfg7,I was just asking and they downvoted
2755,2020-08-19 11:51:28,icjfg7,"That's good, but am still curious how she's maintaining her Instagram followers.
There was a website showing the actually decrease in followers for Kjo (decreased from 18 million to 10 million)
Alia was at 48 million, dipped down to 45 million but when I saw recently it was back to 48 million again. I know followers can be paid bots but surely not this high numbers?"

Mods can delete if it doesn't fit into the sub but it's been a bit quiet so thought this can't hurt
2791,2020-08-18 22:25:58,icauxu,Not the point. Majority of people are in both subs and nobody needs to see this twice. Pick one and only post it there
2792,2020-08-18 22:25:06,icauxu,"yeah I get you and respect your viewpoint, but news is genuine content and speculation and discussion has become tiring at this point.

2797,2020-08-18 21:05:08,ic9lvi,"Dude 90% of music from those periods were label-manufactured trash as well, and it goes back far before then. Every major band-leader had a TV show, a comedy special, and a stage production to sell their brand. 

There's probably more talented musicians making careers for themselves today than any point in history because recording technology is more accessible than ever, but just like in 1965, they aren't being played on the radio. The fact you're naming One Direction and Justin Bieber as examples tells me you don't follow pop to begin with, because even that genre has become a lot more varied and instrumentally sophisticated."

All the decades had their one directions and beibers. What you're doing is judging those decades by the best of the best, the ones we remember and stood the test of time. The crap bands have all been forgotten. In 20 years time half of them will be forgotten and we'll have the good stuff left. Paramore, Adele, Lorde, The Black Keys etc. I'm getting old now and set in my ways but there's been bands I've discovered and followed like The Pretty Reckless, Hailstorm and fuck The Gaslight Anthem for me is up their with My Favourite Bands, Foos, RHCP and AC/CD...I really love them.

Same shit, different generation. I also remember kids like you witht he same opinions back then. OMG The 90s are the worst, Spice Girls ...NSYNC IT'S ALL MAINSTREAM SHIT!!!"

Singing is no less a talent than playing four chords on a guitar. 

An alternative take, Brian Eno is one of the most influential and important artists in modern music, and he has always maintained he is not a musician. What makes his music important is the arrangements and production, not any skill with an instrument."
2828,2020-08-18 21:20:35,ic9lvi,The monkees started when they were all cast together in a tv show.  That tv show made them popular artists.

Fuck even when I look at old charts, I recognise the names but couldn't tell you what half the songs were. And I used to sit and listen to the charts EVERY SINGLE SUNDAY while recording them on cassette.

Man this isn't new, there's just more of it  (all) and more readily available."
2830,2020-08-18 21:31:55,ic9lvi,"No, having specific ones can."
2831,2020-08-18 21:13:19,ic9lvi,"I will agree the Beatles are more talented than most, still not my thing, but I get it. I also regret saying all three were bad, to each their own"
2832,2020-08-19 18:32:30,ic9lvi,"So did the Shaggs, just because they compose their own music does not make it good. The Beatles barely knew how to play their instruments, they stuck to a few chords and sang catchy lyrics. Same as the bands you complain about. They were literally a boy band."
2833,2020-08-18 21:14:41,ic9lvi,To be fair all types of music have trash. Not to mention that itll also be very subjective on who's good and bad.
2834,2020-08-19 00:47:40,ic9lvi,"I‚Äôm guessing you really don‚Äôt listen to current gen rap. Rappers like lil tjay, pop smoke(rip), don toliver have more or equal talent to those old heads."
2835,2020-08-18 21:22:42,ic9lvi,"I get what you're saying and I'm not a fan of the monkees, my problem with the production is it's not the artist who dictate's the production of the music anymore, it tends to be songwriters and sound engineers doing it for them, but yh like you say the production is more important than playing an instrument tbf."
2836,2020-08-18 21:48:36,ic9lvi,That's everyone nowadays though tbf
2837,2020-08-18 22:02:36,ic9lvi,But then what point are you making about music not being better in the 60s and 70s if you say that most mainstream bands from the late 90s and after were worse than the Beatles?
2838,2020-08-18 21:17:40,ic9lvi,"That's a fair point but to me if an artist hadn't always show talent for music their entire life, and write their own stuff, they shouldn't be selling millions of records"
2839,2020-08-18 21:25:33,ic9lvi,"It‚Äôs always been that way, though. The Beatles would have been nothing without George Martin, Joy Divison *hated* the sound they ended up being known for. 

The difference now is that many artists actually *can* take charge of their sounds because they‚Äôre the ones doing the production as well. As cliche as the example is, Kevin Parker isn‚Äôt a great musician, but he‚Äôs a fantastic producer that made Tame Impala what it is"
2840,2020-08-18 22:07:06,ic9lvi,"First. You can't hold an entire decade of music to 1 band. By the same logic I could hold the 60's to Ohio Express and say it's a shit era. So saying they're worse than the beatles is dumb. There's an entire decade of artists that made music, not just the beatles. 

Second. I'm pointing out that todays music and all it's manufactured glory has always existed. It's not new. All of todays forgettable bands and sounds will join previous histories forgettable sounds. In 20 years time we'll look back at today and remember the best and the novelty too...Looking at you YMCA."
2841,2020-08-18 21:20:50,ic9lvi,You could get into music at any age. I dont think it should be something you have to do since childhood. Eminem who is arguably one of the greatest rappers wasnt picked up till he was 29 if I recall correctly. Not to mention entry into the musical genre has never been easier. Who knows how many failed artist we no longer remember from when the bettels were around.
2842,2020-08-19 18:27:47,ic9lvi,">if an artist hadn't always show talent for music their entire life

That is an absolutely terrible and ignorant take. This disvalues any sort of argument you possibly could have had and shows you know very little, at best, about music. No one, not one single person was as talented at music when they were born as when they published their final record. Even Mozart, the most famous child prodigy in known musical history, refined his craft and improved mis musical theory and knowledge as he progressed through his career. 
Before condemning an entire decade, or multiple decades, of music maybe you should take some music history classes, or at the very least listen to more than music that gets played on the radio. I have only seen you argue the point of music on the radio. What about the hundreds of thousands of artists who have never been played on the radio?"
2843,2020-08-18 21:29:38,ic9lvi,"Not true, George Martin was only involved in their Sgt. Pepper's album because of the complexity (they used a 40 piece orchestra on their 'A Day in the Life' track) and that was in 1967 so 3 years after they became massive. Max Martin has written songs for Taylor Swift, Maroon 5, Katy Perry, Justin Bieber, The Backstreet Boys, Robin Vick and so many more. See the difference?"
2844,2020-08-18 22:14:44,ic9lvi,"I know I could say the kinks, the rolling stones, led zeppelin, the beach boys, pink Floyd ect, but the beatles changed the world LITERALLY which is why I bring them up. I know it's always existed but tbf it's PREDOMINANTLY manufactured now but back in the day it barely ever was."
2845,2020-08-18 21:25:32,ic9lvi,"He had his first big hit in 1996 when he was 24, but he always loved music if you look into his childhood"
2846,2020-08-18 21:33:06,ic9lvi,"And a big chunk of Jimi Hendrix‚Äôs most famous songs are blues covers. 

The point I‚Äôm making is that unless you‚Äôre looking at indie records, most music is artistically ‚Äúcompromised‚Äù in some way."
2847,2020-08-18 22:17:04,ic9lvi,"OK so All I'm getting now isn't a point on old OR modern music. All you're really saying now is ""I love the Beatles, they're amazing"". Which I can get behind."
2848,2020-08-18 21:34:36,ic9lvi,Most people are interested in music at a young age though. That doesnt mean you'll necessarily have talent in it though.
2849,2020-08-18 21:37:27,ic9lvi,"They might be covers but Jimi Hendrix hardly strikes me as a model who looks good on an album cover, so maybe his music is 'compromised' but he's a guitar God which is the reason he's famous in the first place, not to mention he was around I the 70s when racism was a far bigger problem than it is now, so the fact he got big kind of proves he had tremendous talent."
2850,2020-08-18 22:19:01,ic9lvi,"I'm saying that the beatles relied upon nothing but their talent to get where they got to, no modern musicians do which is why I dislike modern music. Millenials ruined music imo."
2851,2020-08-18 21:39:17,ic9lvi,"Well all I'm saying is Eminem always wanted music to be his first and only career path, but as I say I'm not a rap fan myself, but I do know that making good rap songs requires tremendous skill."
2852,2020-08-18 21:51:50,ic9lvi,"Sure, but that's not changing the fact that there's just as many talented guitarists today. There'll always be a Jimi Hendrix around, but they aren't the rule, they're the fluke. 

Most of the music people were listening to in the '70s was like the Carpenters, who were (surprise) outsourcing their writing to TV jingle agencies and the like. 

A pop song doesn't need to feature a guitar god to be a good song, and if musicianship alone was the driving factor in sales we'd never have gotten beyond Yes, King Crimson, and ELP."
2853,2020-08-18 22:31:38,ic9lvi,"Since the late 90s? Arctic Monkeys. Florence and the Machine, Paramore, The Gaslight Anthem, Hailstorn, The Pretty Reckless, Panic! at the disco, Fall Out Boy, Kings of Leon, Mumford and Sons, Arcade Fire, Ed Sheeran, Adele, Bruno mars...all artists writing their own stuff  and being great singers and musicians (Yes even Bruno Mars).

If you say none of them are as good as the beatles then you're A. Right and B. Saying nobody who lives up to the beetles is any good since if they're not good thus this and last decade has bad music. Then anyone that wasn't in the 60s was awful too as nobody in the 70-90s were as good as the beatles either.

Fact of the matter is, music is music. It's nice when a band or singer has a cool backstory. Whether it's 50-cent being shot a couple of times or some artists living in their car for years while on tour. The end result of the music is what matters. Is it enjoyable. All this BS about deep meaning in lyrics or how they got famous. It's the MUSIC that matters. Plenty of the best bands wrote some of their best songs AFTER their fame while living in luxery. You think The Beatles were hurting when they Wrote Sgt peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band? They were a multiple Platinum winning band at that point. Their talent is what mattered and having the talent is what counts. The rest is just additional.."
2854,2020-08-18 21:40:55,ic9lvi,I'm pretty sure he wanted to be an artist at one point as well. I believe he wanted a creative path but fell in love with music. And some of these people you mention as bad may have wanted to be musicians but never found a way in till down the line.
2855,2020-08-18 21:57:32,ic9lvi,"How are they the fluke? If there were tonnes of people at his level he wouldn't still be talked about. Ask any guitarist how good Jimi Hendrix was and they'll tell you he was an unreal raw natural talent. And yh OK maybe The Carpenters were TV stars, but what about ELO, Queen, ACDC, ABBA, Stevie Ray Vaughan and I could go on further. They were the 70s compared to beiber, one direction, ariana grande, Taylor swift. You have to look at the bigger picture before you compare them."
2856,2020-08-18 22:41:15,ic9lvi,"I'm not saying that there isn't talent nowadays, you mentioned talented artists there, abd I'm not saying a band isn't talented if they're not the beatles either. I'm saying that most modern MAINSTREAM music is bad because it's factory produced and the real talents don't get signed when they should."
2857,2020-08-18 21:43:43,ic9lvi,"Well yeah but being good at art is linked to being a creative musician scientifically so either way. But anyway Eminem isn't my prime example he's just one, I could name loads of bands and artists from back in the day who had genius talent for music compared to today, but you can enjoy modern music obviously, all I'm saying is I don't like the production behind it."
2858,2020-08-18 22:01:57,ic9lvi,"Taylor Swift, Adele, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Rihanna, etc are all just as talented."
2859,2020-08-19 00:33:23,ic9lvi,"Again, always happened. Even if you were right there's 100000 talented artists who never get seen."
2860,2020-08-18 22:02:23,ic9lvi,Fair enough
2861,2020-08-18 22:03:55,ic9lvi,They're just reality TV stars on an album cover
2862,2020-08-18 22:09:16,ic9lvi,"They're extremely talented vocalists, musicians, and skilled in producing pop hits.

So the hundreds of cookie-cutter singers from the past are invalidated by having Queen and Zep, but artists like Adele and Kendrick are not?"
2863,2020-08-18 22:05:13,ic9lvi,"Why are they all really attractive and glamourised then, they all sing about sex and only sex, they can't play any instruments really well and they can't write their own music which is why Max Martin has written songs for all of them?"
2864,2020-08-18 22:16:04,ic9lvi,"I feel like you only say that because you want something to say about your generation, but in reality the talent in music ended after Kurt Cobain's suicide in 1994."
2865,2020-08-18 22:26:20,ic9lvi,"I grew up listening to nothing but The Who, The Beatles, Yes, the Stones, and the Kinks. I'm only 26, but at the time it was cool to say music died in the '80s, and nothing of value came after. But then I started listening to said ""horrible, commercialised crap"" and realized I enjoyed it just as much. '90s indie is one of my top genres now, and the '80s overall are probably my favourite decade for music. And this is coming from someone who would scoff at anyone who even mentioned pop or hip-hop.

Music has existed for thousands of years. To say it suddenly ""died"" in '94 is insane."
2866,2020-08-18 22:45:38,ic9lvi,"You can still enjoy listening to modern Mainstream music if you like it, I don't that's what I'm saying. I know musical TALENT still exists today, it obviously does, but that is the problem I have with the music industry, because nowadays those real talents don't get signed, it's, more than likely some reality TV star or actor or something so the modern day talk ent rarely comes through unless you're talking about Ed Sheeran, Arctic Monkeys or Adele or artists like that, but they're the only ones."
2867,2020-08-18 22:48:12,ic9lvi,"To me it's, like comparing Bear Grills making mudhuts to the builders of the Egyptian Pyramids, it's rediculous"
2868,2020-08-18 22:54:09,ic9lvi,"Again, most of the ""talent"" back in the day was just studios looking for a quick buck. There was a brief period in the early '70s when prog was gaining popularity where anyone would get a deal, but that was ended *very* quickly when they realized nobody wanted to listen to a 20 minute guitar solo interpretation of Mahler's 9th.

Most of the big names today are the definition of self-starters, ether initially on indie labels, through self released SoundCloud projects or other viral success. Nobody is just being picked at random to ""be"" a pop artist. 

Billie Eillish is probably the biggest name in pop right now and she started with her brother and friends releasing independently."
2869,2020-08-18 22:57:14,ic9lvi,OK then tell me where you see the talent in modern musicians and what about the music makes it comparable to back in the day instrumental wise.
2870,2020-08-18 23:05:30,ic9lvi,"Well if [you want instrumental complexity and musicianship, here you go. Every time signature you could ever want, microtonal tuning, the lot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxwu7FYFSek). These guys are huge right now and were headlining festivals with the biggest pop acts before COVID."
2871,2020-08-18 23:07:58,ic9lvi,"[Alternatively, this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YbPSIXQ4q4) Jazz has had a resurgence lately, and the fusion that's been outputted is better than anything in 20 years."
2872,2020-08-18 18:20:08,ic57ht,"Blinding lights longevity, its still top 3 and it came out last year. So happy for him"

2879,2020-08-18 22:33:42,ic57ht,"is Roses that high because the Remix also counts towards those streams? or is the original really that high at number 6? regardless, that remix really propelled him forward. that‚Äôs HUGE for SAINt JHN, been following him for a few years now. so excited to see him get shine"
2880,2020-08-18 19:09:22,ic57ht,Shout out to MoneyBagg Yo
2881,2020-08-18 21:24:39,ic57ht,What you guys think of Smile? Think it‚Äôll stick around in the top 10?
2882,2020-08-18 22:41:58,ic57ht,Happy for Rod Wave. He's pretty much the only hip hop artist out of Tampa Bay/St. Pete.
2883,2020-08-19 02:00:32,ic57ht,how da fuck maroon 5 still around?
2884,2020-08-18 18:55:08,ic57ht,I didnt care for the song but loved In Your Eyes which is a very similar song. I'm clearly in the minority.
2885,2020-08-19 00:37:00,ic57ht,super curious where this song's gonna be in the top streamed songs of the year in US. probably 5th ish I'm guessing. it's a really weird song cause it gets like 70% of its streams from outside the US
2886,2020-08-18 21:48:51,ic57ht,barbz retreated after nicki wasn't in the video
2887,2020-08-18 18:18:50,ic57ht,"Yea the song is huge, it broke the record for most streams in a week (ariana had it before with 7 rings) and its predicted to spend at least another week at number 1, blocking drake from a number 1 debut"
2888,2020-08-18 22:42:57,ic57ht,I still hear more people talking about WAP and don't really know anybody hyping up the Drake record outside of it simply being new Drake. We'll see what happens but I would bet on WAP getting it again if I was a gambler
2889,2020-08-18 22:41:34,ic57ht,He's looking pretty huge
2890,2020-08-18 22:27:25,ic57ht,"Letter From Houston is one of my favorite Rod Wave songs, also Lil Baby killed his verse on the Rags2Riches remix"
2891,2020-08-19 00:11:57,ic57ht,It‚Äôs 100% the remix. I can‚Äôt believe how long it‚Äôs been up there now
2892,2020-08-18 21:30:17,ic57ht,"No i think it will stick around and chart for a while but not top 10, Juice doesnt get enough radio play for that."

2895,2020-08-18 20:12:08,ic57ht,I prefer blinding lights but in your eyes is a good song too. I think in your eyes would have been more successful on the charts if he waited a little bit for releasing the music video
2896,2020-08-19 00:38:14,ic57ht,tbh i don't think nicki is capable of keeping a song up high regardless anymore
2897,2020-08-18 20:04:58,ic57ht,Not most in a week. Most in a song‚Äôs debut week. Also most this year.
2898,2020-08-18 18:54:10,ic57ht,"No way lol. thats crazy

Thank Ben"
2899,2020-08-18 23:14:23,ic57ht,"There's no gamble, WAP is guaranteed to debut at #1 next week and its prob gonna stay there for another couple weeks or unless the expected Drake/Ariana drops. It Laugh now cry later has some parts that go hard but honestly its just not that good. It doesn't feel like it dropped a couple days back bc unfortunately its kinda forgettable. I'm hoping he see the reception from his recent releases and re calibrates for the album. Even though Toosie got #1 it fell of after a week and the two songs with Khaled were extremely mid. Drake imo hasn't met the extremely high bar we've grown to expect from him this year"
2900,2020-08-19 00:14:04,ic57ht,"yeah that‚Äôs my question though, like streams of the Imanbek remix count towards streams of the original song? that‚Äôs pretty interesting. it‚Äôs an official remix so I imagine it‚Äôs same as the Old Town Road scenario

my point being that What‚Äôs Poppin has the Remix charting well and that includes all the artists as if it‚Äôs a separate song. so I wonder what the difference is for Billboard"
2901,2020-08-18 23:14:36,ic57ht,I found Save Your Tears better than both
2902,2020-08-19 00:59:49,ic57ht,"She has a big fanbase because her songs debut top 25 most of the time, but the songs don't really last on the charts. Every year since 2017 she had the biggest fall on the charts, no frauds (2017) dropped 70 spots, chun li dropped 38 spots (2018), megatron dropped 72 spots (2019) and now move your hips dropped 80 spots (the biggest ever). In 2020 she had tusa tho (as a feature), that in the US didn't chart high but in latin america it was a big hit"
2903,2020-08-19 00:50:54,ic57ht,"say so, hot girl summer, idol, fefe, big bank, ball for me, the way life goes, the singles from her last album"
2904,2020-08-18 20:08:39,ic57ht,"Ohh thanks for correcting me, i googled and old town road has that record"
2905,2020-08-19 05:50:32,ic57ht,I think it will lose its 3rd week then regain. BTS is going all out for their 21st drop
2906,2020-08-19 00:19:06,ic57ht,"Hmm I never thought about that actually. From wikipedia:

> To address this issue, Billboard now separates airplay points from a song's original version and its remix, if the remix is determined to be a ""new song"". 

So I guess with What‚Äôs Poppin they decided adding 3 new artists makes it a new song, while the edits done to Roses aren‚Äôt substantial enough to justify tracking it separately"
2907,2020-08-19 04:13:45,ic57ht,"It‚Äôs honestly embarrassing, goes to show you how artificial her metrics are"
2908,2020-08-19 07:16:24,ic57ht,Say so nicki version was only on the charts for one week. The Way Life Goes Nicki version is less popular than the original. Matter of fact all these songs are features
2909,2020-08-19 09:41:37,ic57ht,"Out of those didn't only Say So stay top 10 for more than a month? and tbh crediting Nicki with that staying top 10 doesn't feel right since it was already top 10 before she jumped on it, but I guess she did get it #1

&#x200B;

didn't all the singles from her album tank? it just seems like she doesn't have the mainstream appeal that Megan & Cardi have now, seems she's clinging on to these huge features which she can get still off name appeal"
2910,2020-08-19 05:22:42,ic57ht,"Reddit hates nicki lmao, this was going top 3 too if Ferg team didnt mess it up. Nicki has fallen off in the past couple years but she had a great 2020"
2911,2020-08-19 00:57:53,ic57ht,"Actually its becuase the remix gets the majority of the plays,  if any of the remixes pass a certain threshold pf points then the remix artists get credited."
2912,2020-08-19 09:34:15,ic57ht,"it was going #3 but I said she can't keep songs up high, which she can't. It would have plummetted down to 50th++ a week later because Nicki stans exploited pure sales to get it high. same as trollz"

Speaking of, anyone happen to know what the circumcision rate in Canada compared to the US?"
2931,2020-08-29 00:26:08,ic04mp,I wonder if he was cut at a later age. Doesn‚Äôt really look like RIC to me.
2932,2020-08-22 03:22:59,ic04mp,"These were sourced from Twitter, on a very non-conspicuous profile. It's apparent he sends nudes to his fans on occasion, JB might be the next Aaron Carter."

2935,2020-08-18 21:49:59,ic04mp,"In 2006, about 30% of all newborn males were cut, in the US the rate was about 56% the same year."
2936,2020-08-18 22:37:40,ic04mp,"It varies drastically by province, but overall it‚Äôs dropped fairly low over the last 30 years."
2937,2020-08-21 06:46:12,ic04mp,"Depends on the province and age group. Western Canada and Ontario have the highest rates. Men born in the 50s and 60s tend to all be circumcised. Rates drop after that. However, I was born in the 90s and a good amount of my friends are circumcised. I would peg it at around 50 to 60 percent cut. 

Recent numbers are hard to come by but it appears to be around 30 percent. Of course that ranges geographically."
2938,2020-08-18 19:17:32,ic04mp,Yes

We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

3076,2020-08-17 22:04:43,ibnw7n,Travis will never put effort into a song that is never seeing the light of the day
3077,2020-08-17 22:05:33,ibnw7n,xd
3078,2020-08-17 22:05:38,ibnw7n,bye

3093,2020-08-17 22:19:12,ibnw7n,üëÄ
3094,2020-08-17 22:20:17,ibnw7n,tomorrow morning or 12 EST?
3095,2020-08-17 22:20:26,ibnw7n,tomorrow??????
3096,2020-08-17 22:20:37,ibnw7n,Didn‚Äôt alek say the movie isn‚Äôt a comedy?
3097,2020-08-17 22:21:40,ibnw7n,Thats the pusha one right? Fuck bro i was so ready to bump the shit out of that
3098,2020-08-17 22:21:46,ibnw7n,"Why hasn't anyone on his  team say don't compare Bill Cosby to Kobe Bryant...I hope this rumor is cap but i have a feeling it isn't, which sucks"
3099,2020-08-17 22:22:24,ibnw7n,^^
3100,2020-08-17 22:22:32,ibnw7n,Why would rollout start on a tuesday?
3101,2020-08-17 22:24:12,ibnw7n,"Ok, i feel like we might get annluncement tmr, tracklist wednesday, and album friday"
3102,2020-08-17 22:24:19,ibnw7n,All guesses btw
3103,2020-08-17 22:24:21,ibnw7n,Can U verify somehow pls
3104,2020-08-17 22:24:36,ibnw7n,"In Jesus name, no more cap"
3105,2020-08-17 22:25:17,ibnw7n,Noooo way Theres a kobe diss
3106,2020-08-17 22:25:17,ibnw7n,All i have to say is the only days ive worn my jik detroit shirt with my brown pants are the only days ye has tweeted in the past 2 weeks so im keeping this outfit on for tmr
3107,2020-08-17 22:25:41,ibnw7n,Why would it be disrespectful? You can talk about dead people. Particularly when they‚Äôve (probably) done bad stuff.
3108,2020-08-17 22:25:54,ibnw7n,"this is like the 4th person to talk about a controversial Kobe line, but not one person has said anything more than ""it's about the rape allegations"" can we get anything more?"
3109,2020-08-17 22:26:27,ibnw7n,theres no way we get a kobe diss
3110,2020-08-17 22:26:35,ibnw7n,Agreed
3111,2020-08-17 22:27:15,ibnw7n,Could be controversial and not bad towards kobe could be something like comparing him to a god or idk something random
3112,2020-08-17 22:27:17,ibnw7n,"The supposed Kobe line gives me big ""Alex Jones said that same shit in 05"" vibes"
3113,2020-08-17 22:27:41,ibnw7n,the kobe diss line could be from an earlier version of the song that could've been sold to people like alek
3114,2020-08-17 22:27:55,ibnw7n,especialy since kanhe considers kobe his brother
3115,2020-08-17 22:28:06,ibnw7n,*kanye
3116,2020-08-17 22:28:09,ibnw7n,Ye he respects him soooooo much
3117,2020-08-17 22:28:24,ibnw7n,it's probably about his presidential run isn't it
3118,2020-08-17 22:28:30,ibnw7n,shit's gonna be WILD
3119,2020-08-17 22:28:46,ibnw7n,"How do they know the movie is a comedy too LMAO, man I feel like Kanye's team is leaking shit on purpose to find out who's responsible"
3120,2020-08-17 22:28:55,ibnw7n,Yeah u can be controversial without dissing the person u r referring to
3121,2020-08-17 22:29:21,ibnw7n,they lied or something like that
3122,2020-08-17 22:29:44,ibnw7n,If the rollout starts tomorrow does that imply album Friday?
3123,2020-08-17 22:29:50,ibnw7n,All i know is if we get an album tweet tmr imma be in the happiest mood
3124,2020-08-17 22:30:16,ibnw7n,"If the rollout happens tomorrow, aka any news about the album its a celebration"
3125,2020-08-17 22:30:23,ibnw7n,Could be a slower rollout where ss stuff is released first
3126,2020-08-17 22:00:20,ibnw7n,Not all of it is confirmed yet
3127,2020-08-17 22:23:55,ibnw7n,"I, personally, would find a Kobe diss fucking hilarious and hope Kanye does it"
3128,2020-08-17 22:15:37,ibnw7n,That is just speculation but definitely more secular theme
3129,2020-08-17 22:22:35,ibnw7n,"Exactly, Kim and Vanessa are friends...that shit would be wild"
3130,2020-08-17 22:29:04,ibnw7n,so the controversial part is about the victim not kobe
3131,2020-08-17 22:20:43,ibnw7n,Off The Grid...
3132,2020-08-17 22:27:22,ibnw7n,Supposedly explicit but for sure more secular. Think Jesus Tok is for his kids and other kids because they shouldnt be listening to explicit music
3133,2020-08-17 22:01:44,ibnw7n,üòÇ
3134,2020-08-17 22:02:46,ibnw7n,hell yeah brother
3135,2020-08-17 22:15:47,ibnw7n,i mean there could be 2 bieber and lil baby features but that seems unlikely imo
3136,2020-08-17 22:18:04,ibnw7n,Honestly this seems more likely cause I can‚Äôt see Common being on a Kanye record nowadays lol
3137,2020-08-17 22:19:28,ibnw7n,Ye will probably take it off.Hopefully
3138,2020-08-17 22:18:54,ibnw7n,FriYe
3139,2020-08-17 22:20:54,ibnw7n,Idk
3140,2020-08-17 22:22:32,ibnw7n,Heard it has serious aspects too it but is presented in more of a humerous way
3141,2020-08-17 22:22:03,ibnw7n,"yes, otg was the one with push"
3142,2020-08-17 22:23:25,ibnw7n,"by rollout I feel like it's just album announcement again, and then tracklist either the next day or in thrusday since Tuesday is a weird day to start"
3143,2020-08-17 22:23:27,ibnw7n,An album rollout can start any day
3144,2020-08-17 22:26:43,ibnw7n,"Yeah, where did they get this info...As bad as it sounds, it sucks that I believe Kanye would do this"
3145,2020-08-17 22:28:52,ibnw7n,"I never thought about that, would be interesting to hear"
3146,2020-08-17 22:30:28,ibnw7n,Could be any friday tbh
3147,2020-08-17 22:30:04,ibnw7n,yeah
3148,2020-08-17 22:30:05,ibnw7n,Could be tbe next week depending on the speed
3149,2020-08-17 22:30:29,ibnw7n,"two people have said this week or next week, (alek and someone else) but those were just guesses I think"
3150,2020-08-17 22:00:49,ibnw7n,üòÇ
3151,2020-08-17 22:24:43,ibnw7n,You're sick
3152,2020-08-17 22:24:44,ibnw7n,it would be disrespectful
3153,2020-08-17 22:25:48,ibnw7n,I really hope he doesnt
3154,2020-08-17 22:23:10,ibnw7n,Wasnt a diss but definitely controversial
3155,2020-08-17 22:17:14,ibnw7n,"yeah, that would be unlikely unless it's something like travis on wuitb which then would be a little more likely for a second verse"
3156,2020-08-17 22:19:50,ibnw7n,"that TheSource info is legit as far as we know, way more reliable than this"
3157,2020-08-17 22:20:08,ibnw7n,"yeah, but on thesource only verified users can post so at least on that it's a little more reliable than this post, but we'll just have to wait and see if he's right with the rollout starting tomorrow"
3158,2020-08-17 22:25:20,ibnw7n,good lol
3159,2020-08-17 22:21:45,ibnw7n,is jb on eternal life a second verse? since on thesource it was said jb was on in gods country
3160,2020-08-17 22:27:42,ibnw7n,"I don't doubt it being true, but is it being own out of proportion? we don't really know unless it drops or someone actually tells us"
3161,2020-08-17 22:29:31,ibnw7n,"Yo, that could be it LOL...Announcing in the middle of his album that he's dropping out and running in 2024"
3162,2020-08-17 22:24:17,ibnw7n,"Its like the Whitney Houston bathroom pic situation again, like I understand Kanye's point but people are still grieving...I really hope this cap"
3163,2020-08-17 22:20:52,ibnw7n,they also got the pusha feature on OTG correct

3168,2020-08-17 21:36:47,ibnena,Oh jeez... at least 3. I‚Äôd like to think that‚Äôs a good guess.
3169,2020-08-17 21:23:20,ibn5mn,Influencers are no longer allowed into the music industry. Only puppets like Bieber

3172,2020-09-07 15:59:34,io9nve,Ben and Jerry‚Äôs owners got arrested at a blm protest if I‚Äôm not mistaken. They acted way before anyone tried to get them to kiss the ass of the cause.
3173,2020-09-07 18:39:15,io9nve,"Yeah this never happens. The types of people who go ""fuck corporations"" are always the same people who criticise these corporations for only supporting their cause in hollow ways whilst not actually doing anything meaningful. Nobody who champions BLM was begging Twitter to remove the terms ""blacklist"" and ""slave/master"" from their coding language."
3174,2020-09-07 22:19:10,io9nve,"I saw some YouTube video of people protesting big banks. Someone walked around asking if they'd close their bank accounts to hurt and none would.

https://youtu.be/hMhXs3-2Evo"
3175,2020-09-07 21:38:38,io9nve," I can do whatever the fuck I want, I'm unapologetically hypocritical."
3176,2020-09-07 15:43:35,io9nve,Don't see anybody doing this
3177,2020-09-07 21:41:30,io9nve,"Most activists want corporation to act instead of just speak. Like when corporations release a bunch of pride merch but don‚Äôt donate to LGBTQ charities, or say ‚ÄùBLM‚Äù without actually doing anything for the cause. Idk the way this post was written makes OP sound like a Tucker Carlson fanboy"
3178,2020-09-07 18:28:59,io9nve,‚ÄúFUCK CORPORATIONS!‚Äù Stocks up on beyond meat
3179,2020-09-07 20:25:08,io9nve,Who does this??
3180,2020-09-08 00:30:01,io9nve,"If its a cause that is gonna be on the right side of history in like 10 years, like what all the SJWs care about, then yeah I expect corporations to do whatever is in their best financial interest. Pressuring them publicly to come out in favour of an issue is a democratic thing. It shows that popular opinion will effect their bottom line, and in turn gives more visibility to that. Fuck them for being shallow, but use their shallowness for your agenda. 

Its like how you might not like Biden but still vote for him in the election. Its not hypocritical its politically pragmatic."
3181,2020-09-08 03:21:53,io9nve,Corporations are groups of people who are working together in a complex network. If you say you hate corporations then you are just saying you hate groups of people who cooperate to achieve a goal. We need to cooperate. It‚Äôs what allows us to surpass every other animal. Humans have the ability to specialize like no other.
3182,2020-09-08 05:07:15,io9nve,The Pride organization did this in my area and it back fired. They've been overrun by BLM and have now started hating on corporations saying they'd prefer not to have their sponsorships. So the corps cut their sponsorships. Pride then went to small business demanding they give millions of dollars for sponsorships. Of course that didn't happen so they covered it up and then didn't pay any of their vendors for last year's festival. I'm not sure what would've happened this year if the festival hadn't been cancelled for covid.
3183,2020-09-08 07:10:59,io9nve,"I generally agree with OP, but leave Ben & Jerry's out of this. They are much more legit than most corporations, and they always have been.

BUT.... most other corporations, yeah.... it's super-awkward to see them stumbling over carefully-crafted social justice messages in 2020 with the coronavirus and BLM, when we all know that all they really want to do is make money, even if it means using prison labor and foreign child labor to make their products."
3184,2020-09-08 13:17:31,io9nve,"Yeah we actually can though.

It's them who have to kiss ass to stay relevant. And we can expect them to keep doing it as as long as that's the case.

Also, fuck them."
3185,2020-09-08 17:06:05,io9nve,Are we not allowed to expect things that tend to happen?
3186,2020-09-07 15:57:56,io9nve,"No one begs them to talk about things lmao, especially not ones like ben and Jerry's. 

They'll probably judge the corporations for not supporting the cause but they, like you would, do that for anyone who doesn't support the cause. 

People who say fuck the corporations are typically the ones to least expect a corporation to support the same movement as them."
3187,2020-09-07 15:38:46,io9nve,Ya I agree.
3188,2020-09-07 22:23:12,io9nve,"while they narcissistically ramble on about whatsoever is troubling them. see the answer?

narcissistically!"
3189,2020-09-08 05:20:22,io9nve,"I see more of HEY! YOURE NOT SAYING ANYTHING ABOUT BLM. 
and then they say something about blm 
HEY! YOU DONT FUCKING CARE STOP ACTING LIKE YOU DO YOU FUCKING CORPORATE SWINES!"
3190,2020-09-07 15:54:23,io9nve,Why not?  Half the country thinks the other half feels the same way about Government.
3191,2020-09-07 18:50:17,io9nve,They also employ ex-cons and pay above minimum wage starting!  Ben and Jerry's is the shit!

Why isn't it: ""Corporations should support us... but they don't. Fuck corporations?"""
3200,2020-09-07 22:25:28,io9nve,(that is the point of this comment)
3201,2020-09-07 23:04:07,io9nve,It‚Äôs like you can taste the appropriately compensated ex-con
3202,2020-09-07 18:32:17,io9nve,"Well, I‚Äôd say a lot of them are commies so that‚Äôs something."
3203,2020-09-07 22:37:15,io9nve,Sorry your right miss readüòü
3204,2020-09-07 19:33:42,io9nve,"Most of them are dem soc, not even socialist, let alone communist. Unironically calling people commies makes you look worse than the people you are trying to criticize"
3205,2020-09-08 10:18:43,io9nve,"Typical, a right-winger generalising a group of people and reducing them to ""commies""."
3206,2020-09-07 19:49:30,io9nve,this can be an unpopular opinion. Agree tho
3207,2020-09-07 19:53:58,io9nve,"Ok, a lot of them might not be (Or wouldn‚Äôt say they are). But supporting a movement with Marxist roots that‚Äôs called Black Lives Matter but doesn‚Äôt give a shit about black lives isn‚Äôt a good look."
3208,2020-09-08 11:01:28,io9nve,"When did I say that they‚Äôre all commies? Oh, and from the 4 people that replied here already 1 is in r/latestagecapitalism lmao"
3209,2020-09-07 20:00:08,io9nve,"I'm heavily involved with BLM, and I find your statement about the movement not caring about black lives to be untrue. Feel free to make a good-faith argument though, and I will respond when I can."
3210,2020-09-08 08:23:01,io9nve,"Firstly you obviously have no idea what Marxism actually is, and are starting in bad faith, you‚Äôre already emotionally settled on the belief that BLM doesn‚Äôt care about black lives, with literally nothing to support your argument. You‚Äôre literally just pulling information out of your ass."
3211,2020-09-07 20:06:40,io9nve,"I said it because the don‚Äôt care about black people, they only care about black lives when they‚Äôre killed by white cops, they don‚Äôt care about black business owners, they don‚Äôt care about black police officers, they don‚Äôt care about black veterans. And I‚Äôm sure you do, but most BLM activists either don‚Äôt care at all or not enough to mention. What‚Äôs the point of destroying black owned businesses, hell, any business at all, no reason for race to matter."
3212,2020-09-07 20:13:07,io9nve,"The protests were 90%+ peaceful. You can google it if you want. There were millions protesting, and most of the rioting and destruction happened in places where police abuses were the worst. Now I'm not trying to defend everything done by every single person who went to the protests, but given the numbers you cannot deny that a majority of the people are trying to keep things non-violent as long as that option is on the table. Don't let media narratives paint a false picture for you. Look up the numbers and facts on your own, and you will see the truth."
3213,2020-09-07 20:18:58,io9nve,"I‚Äôll use the same thing that‚Äôs used against cops, you‚Äôre saying that it‚Äôs just a few bad apples, but I don‚Äôt see anyone calling out the violence, Joe Biden didn‚Äôt even bother to mention BLM after 2 months of violence. I‚Äôve only seen activists like Trevor Noah encouraging it (Not surprised)"
3214,2020-09-07 20:31:48,io9nve,"Do you think that BLM supporters are all responsible to each other the same way cops are? I don't. Even so, there is a lot of footage of protesters trying to stop other protesters from doing stupid destructive shit.   


I dislike Biden so I don't really follow everything he says, but I'm pretty sure he did denounce the looting and rioting."

3219,2020-09-07 13:56:30,io7nmu,"That fandom has always been toxic as fuckk, I'm genuinely not surprised by this"
3220,2020-09-07 13:47:30,io7nmu,Thats because the Justin bieber Fandom is full of cancer that don't know how to take a joke
3221,2020-09-07 13:13:49,io6y5a,"illuminati is not ""dark magic stuff"". It was a secret society in late 18th-century Germany and far more mundane than it is made out to be. The reason it was secret was mainly because at the time, German territories did not know freedom of speech and political opinions were oftentimes heavily censored or even punished.

As for the ""all-seeing eye"": that's basically an old christian (Catholic) symbol. The eye in the center represents the eye of God who is able to see everything. The pyramid or triangle around it symbolizes Holy Trinity; the sanctity of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit (Pater, Filius et Spiritus Sanctus). I can't tell you whether people such as Justin Bieber and Pewdiepie are aware of this because they don't strike me as particularly intelligent individuals. Maybe they just think it's a ""cool"" symbol. However, iconographically speaking, wearing this symbol on your body is comparable to wearing a crucifix neckless."
3222,2020-09-07 13:03:51,io6y5a,We don't talk about that here üëÅ

3224,2020-09-07 13:19:59,io6y5a,Thank you very much. I wasn‚Äôt aware that the all seeing eye was related to christianity. Irony how a lot of people connects the illuminati eye with ‚Äúantichrist‚Äù(specially muslims).

3226,2020-09-07 11:12:29,io5jzx,Gimme a Dommy.
3227,2020-09-07 12:42:08,io5jzx,Probally a Phillies card
3228,2020-09-07 11:58:56,io5jzx,Credit Freeman hit grand slams in back to back games for his first and second career grand slams. He should get one. Or Adam Duvall for his 3 homer game this week.
3229,2020-09-07 11:54:44,io5jzx,Probably Smith. Degrom is getting a CY Young card for sure
3230,2020-09-07 12:41:59,io5jzx,Dong Smith every day of the week and twice on Sunday plz. All that boy does is hit
3231,2020-09-07 16:41:13,io5jzx,topps has to make the cards and degrom was the only met to get one from yesterday‚Äôs game
3232,2020-09-07 13:55:01,io5jzx,"You forget freeman 2 grand slams in 3 days.  

His first and second of his career"
3233,2020-09-07 18:02:10,io5jzx,"Considering that degrom was the only player to get a card from that game in irl topps now, there won‚Äôt be a card from that game in MLB the show. They can‚Äôt put a card in the game if topps didn‚Äôt make it and topps ended up only making that 1 card from that game. I‚Äôm pretty sure they‚Äôre saving a high 90s degrom for a cy young awards card."
3234,2020-09-07 13:58:55,io5jzx,"I think Smith gets one. Alonso has a sick hrd card already.

The Met card 5 this year are weird: they've got 3 90+ catchers and no 90+ OFs. SDS needs to get Beltran's rights for next year :)"
3235,2020-09-07 11:13:48,io5jzx,"Honestly, before last year, I really wanted him to be traded. Obviously talented, but just had awful attitude and just not needed. So glad I dont make those decisions cause he's turning into a favorite"
3236,2020-09-07 13:57:54,io5jzx,All about that Blake Parker baby!
3237,2020-09-07 12:00:09,io5jzx,"I mean, i was talking just about this specific game...obviously Duvall is getting one. Freeman is also possible"
3238,2020-09-07 13:57:20,io5jzx,No I didn't. I was asking what Topps Now card we'd be getting from this specific game cause of so many worthy candidates
3239,2020-09-07 18:11:32,io5jzx,Dame
3240,2020-09-07 14:08:34,io5jzx,"Dude, a prime Strawberry would be unreal. I think Conforto could end diamond if he keeps hitting the way he has been too. I cant think of outstanding outfielders we've had that would warrant a diamond except for Straw and Beltran. Maybe Endy Chavez, Mike Cameron, Cliff Floyd, Art Shamsky, Dave Kingman, Rusty Staub, a GG Juan Laguras or Tommie Agee, SS Cespedes. Im really grasping at straws though and definitely forgetting a couple"
3241,2020-09-07 15:28:50,io5jzx,They need to trade him in the off-season. His value will never be higher. They need defense. Smith has a better glove at first than Alonso but I can't imagine what it would take to move the Polar Bear. In the outfield they're just not good defensively. Third base is another defensive hole. This is what's hurting their pitchers. Constantly having to get extra outs will destroy your staff. Even deGrom has gotten bit by the defense behind him.
3242,2020-09-07 13:20:44,io5jzx,Dude how can you of been a Mets fan if you wanted him traded. Dom Smith been one of the best teammates on the team even though he could of started on 15 other teams because he knew Alonso was special too
3243,2020-09-07 12:00:50,io5jzx,Ya I know. I just wanted to talk about it lol
3244,2020-09-07 14:04:23,io5jzx,Got ya. Apparently my critical thinking failed me this morning.
3245,2020-09-07 14:32:00,io5jzx,"Yeah the prime or awards cards could make it happen...Prime Roger Cedeno would excite...no one.

I'm in big on Conforto hitting diamond, if it happens I'm using proceeds to buy Piazza. OPS is right around 1.000, 10th in the league (Dom is #5). I don't know how his defense grades out, tricky this year bc sss. 

Expecting Nimmo to go silver and Dom at gold. Conforto probably another week away unless he really kills it the next 3 days..."
3246,2020-09-07 15:34:59,io5jzx,"I think the defense is just age. They have a couple of young guys that showed 70+ defense in the minors that just need to transfer it to the majors (Gimenez and Guillerme). Davis had shown improvement at third at least. Conforto and Nimmo aren't bad in the OF, not great, but still, both 27. And Smith is playing out of position. Then McNeil goes where he's needed. It could be worse and I think can only get better"
3247,2020-09-07 13:38:49,io5jzx,"Because prior to 2019 he was not that at all. He was notoriously difficult. Overweight, bad attitude, lackadaisical,  etc. Coaches talked to him at the beginning of last year about how much of a privilege it is to be in the bigs and he responded amazingly to it. My attitude has changed towards him, he's shown he cares and can be an amazing teammate. I remember talking to my cousin in 18 saying they shouldve traded Smith and d'arnaud for maybe Realmuto or something. In conclusion, kindly go fuck yourself with questioning my loyalty and dedication as a fan. Been a fan my whole life and will be one till the day I die"
3248,2020-09-07 12:01:33,io5jzx,Damn Braves fans....can't let anyone else have any glory
3249,2020-09-07 14:09:08,io5jzx,No worries! It monday and a holiday. Crack open a beer for me!
3250,2020-09-07 14:34:07,io5jzx,"No prime Lee Mazzilli?? Outlier: can break toe easier than most. Yeah, Id be shocked if Conforto doesn't get it next week"
3251,2020-09-07 15:50:04,io5jzx,"I agree with you on your points. Gimenez did have that bad inning that cost the Mets vs the Yankees but he's not the future at third. Davis can be as long as he hits. McNeil really best at second with Cano as DH, which I assume is here to stay unfortunately, so if they can try to get a top notch outfielder to play left for Dom and one of the shortstops that would be ideal. Unless of course they can move Cano then keep Dom but nobody is taking that contract right now."
3252,2020-09-07 16:42:15,io5jzx,"If coaches talked to him about all that how did he come in 40 pounds less then? Your just wrong watch what all his teammates said about him dude. Pete, McNeil, jd davis all have always said he‚Äôs a great teammate"
3253,2020-09-07 12:02:42,io5jzx,Let us enjoy our offense. We lost our Canadian ace.
3254,2020-09-07 14:40:25,io5jzx,Kevin McReynolds. Greg Jeffries rookie.
3255,2020-09-07 15:53:55,io5jzx,"Honestly, besides the contract, Cano is solid. Hes hitting, he's a leader and he's not the gold glover he was, but still a solid fielder. But im not of the opinion to trade for pure defense, unless its a Rey Ordenez type. They're all serviceable right now which is what fine by me. I personally think we need another starter so that Lugo can go back to the pen"

3258,2020-09-07 14:43:41,io5jzx,Jeffries was a second baseman his rookie year though. And McReynolds? Maybe a postseason card? Not worthy a diamond though in my opinion
3259,2020-09-07 14:49:10,io5jzx,"I'm mostly joking but: 88 be had an ops+ of 142, 21 steals 0 caught, .288/.336/.496. and that was a bad year for offense, those numbers are better than they look.

Same era, different position: 89 HoJo, .287 .369 .559, 169 ops+ with 41 steals. That would be a nice card, 98 overall 3b/ss."
3260,2020-09-07 14:52:35,io5jzx,"98 overall??? Whatever you're smoking, can I get some?? I could see maybe a 92, 93 if that. And maybeeeee an 88 or 89 for McReynolds?"
3261,2020-09-07 14:58:23,io5jzx,"For that 89 season? Yeah. SDS juices prime & awards cards late in the season. 36 homers was second in the league, offensive WAR of 8 lead the league. 89 was a totally different offensive environment. McGriff lead the AL in homers with 36."
3262,2020-09-07 15:03:22,io5jzx,".273/.330/.503. OPS of .833 and OPS+ of 124. 33 HR, 121 RBI, 20SB. For an OF. Care to wager what card this is?"
3263,2020-09-07 15:09:00,io5jzx,"Who is? Also there's a huge gap between 124 and 142. And another 20 steals, at ss & 3b (I'm talking about Johnson fwiw).

Jason Heyward has a jacked Awards card, and his highest ops+ coming into 2020 was 131 (rip future hof version of Jason Heyward). SDS jacks stats whenever they want, especially late in the cycle when anything short of a 95 won't get used."
3264,2020-09-07 15:11:51,io5jzx,"That would be 1991 SS Joe Carter. A 92 in this game. I get what you're saying with late game player, but a 98? I could maybe a 94ish for a program player perhaps. A 98 is just too high. 

George Fosters MVP card from 77 is one of the greatest individual seasons up to that point and he's still a 97"
3265,2020-09-07 15:11:55,io5jzx,Heyward in 2012: .269.335.479 (117) with 21 steals and 8 cs. SDS turned that into 100/95 contact/power vs rhp (and an 82 speed).
3266,2020-09-07 15:19:51,io5jzx,"Yeah Johnson's better than '92 Carter. 20 points of ops+ is huge! And Carter was caught 9 times that year, so speed is hardly an asset.

Here's a good comp: Trevor Story 2018: .291.348.567 (127 ops+), 28 steals vs 6 caught, playing his home games in Colorado during a higher output offensive era. SDS gave him a 96 for that season--and HoJo's '89 was better, relative to the league."
3267,2020-09-07 15:23:04,io5jzx,"Alight, maybe I'm wrong. I am also of the opinion that SDS overflate too much, so I may be biased towards that"
3268,2020-09-07 15:24:41,io5jzx,"League averages:
2018: .248.318.409
1989: .254.320.375

Johnson posted his .287/.369/.559 line playing half of his games at Shea, which was a notoriously bad park to hit in..."
3269,2020-09-07 15:26:01,io5jzx,"I def agree on the overinflating part, but it is what it is at this point. Last year they were giving everyone inflated vision to make them useful on HoF, so many dudes with vision 110+."
3270,2020-09-07 15:29:28,io5jzx,Jesus....maybe you're right and a high diamond Met is in bound!
3271,2020-09-07 15:33:42,io5jzx,Haha they just gave us a jacked Rosario even though he sucks badly enough this year that he lost his job to FS Andres Gimenez :)
3272,2020-09-07 15:35:41,io5jzx,"I aint counting Topps Now, man we got a 90+ fuckin Nido.

3278,2020-09-07 04:48:05,io0oid,"Right. I just hopped on the twitter train, and I'm sure you know this, but holy shit. I browsed one damn ship tag that I thought was fine since it was canon, and three tweets down, there was a mud-slinging argument taking place. Now I finally get it.

To preface, I don't write anything extremely controversial (yet) but I prefer privacy because of some of reasons you've stated above. The post has been deleted, but there was a user on here that made some critical comments in a vent thread about another author. The author apparently found their post, deduced that it was about them, and blasted them on social media. 

Are all your social media accounts separate from each other? As in, do you use the same pseudonym for all three? You could strictly partition those from your personal accounts, or even separate only your AO3 account from the other two. From my observation, trolls originate from twitter and tumblr (and reddit). It takes more time/effort to wade through actual writing and the sheer amount of fics in AO3 to troll properly, IMO. At least on twitter, they love to search hashtags, and have somewhat of a gang presence.

My twitter and AO3 are linked together, which is a brave (or dumb) move, but like I said, I hardly tweet and currently don't write anything too divisive. In a perfect world, I would keep the twitter and AO3 separate. Hell, I'd cease twitter altogether, but I use it for PM purposes. There's a slim chance you might be doxxed, but better safe than sorry. People can be completely irrational."
3279,2020-09-07 05:56:07,io0oid,[deleted]
3280,2020-09-07 04:48:31,io0oid,"This is all speculation since I don't know exactly how people go about doxxing someone, but being strict about anonymity on the accounts you use to post about the ship might help. Make it as difficult as possible for someone to draw a link between those accounts and your real life. Don't use the same username (don't use your name at all), don't talk about your life, don't talk about where you live or who you talk to. If you only ever post about your ships on an account completely detached from your main and post about nothing else, it'll be harder for people to find information they can use against you."
3281,2020-09-07 14:18:06,io0oid,"A fair amount of doxxing probably results from over-sharing on one's profiles & social media sites.

This happens because of a twitter/tumblr culture which insists that the writer has to show ""creds"" for writing... anything.  Posting one's personal information (age, preferred gender pronouns, sexual orientation, mental & physical health status, etc) ""has to be"" offered up as some kind of spurious preventative against criticism.  Same thing with breathless, histrionic profiles which go into all sorts of personal drama, conflicts with the fandom, etc. 

Of course, this disclosure does no such thing - and tends to invite the very abuse it's intended to prevent.

Long story short: don't overshare online.  No personal pics.  No remarks about one's job, pets, family status etc.  

There's also the matter of password security (strong passwords that are unique to each site), as well as securing one's phone (no, nobody gets to touch the phone.  Bad touch!) but my guess is that much doxxing comes from over-sharing."
3282,2020-09-07 08:46:52,io0oid,"I'm going to second what everyone else has said about keeping your usernames separate and do not refer to any IRL stuff on your Ao3. It's very hard to find identifying information based on username alone - you really need an email address, name or social media page to do any sort of damage. 

But, to add to this, sometimes it's a little bit like good home security - you just have to make your house look less attractive to rob than the one next door. As you say, there are legions of fics these people can hate on, and they'll find one where a simple username google turns up identifying information or someone who's linked their twitter. If you've used a separate username and not linked anywhere else, you should be fine."
3283,2020-09-07 05:19:05,io0oid,"Twitter is an absolute cesspool, so this isn't all too surprising. I probably wouldn't recommend posting there. Even Tumblr is better than Twitter."
3284,2020-09-07 07:02:01,io0oid,"Make sure that you a never tagged in photos, locations, etc. Facebook messenger is supposed to be encrypted. When it does happen, make sure to record the conversation, numbers, etc. And go to the police when needed. Ask your neighbors to watch for any suspicious people around your property and to message you if there is. Have a cameras set up around acess points."
3285,2020-09-07 06:15:32,io0oid,"So I‚Äôm really stupid. But I used my real name on my pen name in AO3 since I started writing and posting there around 2015. I can‚Äôt change it since most of my subscribers know me by that name now and I do book cover and other graphic edits with my name on it too. It is hard, but I‚Äôm considering creating another account to start fresh."

3287,2020-09-07 07:20:25,io0oid,The best way to protect yourself from people attacking your family is to not give those people access to your personal information.
3288,2020-09-07 07:42:02,io0oid,"Move to the country. The only reason doxxing is a threat is because you've got that attack surface made up of all the other people you interact with on a daily basis, most of whom don't know you. When there's only 20,000 people in town and almost everybody is a friend of a friend, there's no way for internet randoms to turn them against you."
3289,2020-09-07 14:21:43,io0oid,">My twitter and AO3 are linked together, which is a brave (or dumb) move

It's probably not dumb if neither your twitter nor AO3 profile (or anything you write in comments or A/Ns) is personal.  There can be good reasons to keep the same *persona* across multiple platforms."
3290,2020-09-07 05:59:41,io0oid,"Just want to add I'm being pretty hypocritical here, you could easily figure out a general location of where I live, with a bit of effort narrow that area down.  
With slightly more effort (also time and a phone) find my work place and therefore me."

3303,2020-09-06 23:44:26,inwp65,I think you have to be at least under the age of 14 before considering having sex with MJ.
3304,2020-09-06 23:51:27,inwp65,"I think Justin Beiber and Michael Jackson would make the best pair. Mind you, I'm not sure if Michael Jackson is attracted to little girls"

3306,2020-09-07 07:34:50,invddt,Fantastic
3307,2020-09-09 20:02:53,invddt,Reminds me of Christian Rex Van Minnen‚Äôs work.
3308,2020-09-06 19:42:04,insfmx,They‚Äôre such a broadcast to listen to. Winning or losing they make the most of it
3309,2020-09-06 19:41:53,insfmx,i love our booth so much
3310,2020-09-06 19:47:30,insfmx,That's great they went back and made light of it.
3311,2020-09-06 22:31:46,insfmx,When they mention Steve Jobs they‚Äôre referring to a moment I believe last year when Gary accidentally called their sideline reporter Steve Gelbs by that name. The immediate visual reaction from Ron and Keith was hilarious.
3312,2020-09-06 19:48:02,insfmx,"‚ÄúJustin Bieber starting for the Indians today‚Äù

Amazing"
3313,2020-09-06 19:40:13,insfmx,Not Justin
3314,2020-09-06 21:07:10,insfmx,Gotta love Gelbs. ‚ÄúOf course I heard it‚Äù
3315,2020-09-06 21:40:59,insfmx,Keith's laugh fills me with so much joy
3316,2020-09-06 19:48:16,insfmx,Shane Bieber = the better Bieber
3317,2020-09-06 22:23:11,insfmx,Is Buck Martinez infectious?
3318,2020-09-06 22:43:15,insfmx,We are so lucky to have such a wonderful booth :D
3319,2020-09-07 03:16:01,insfmx,Shane Beiber gonna be making Justin Beiber type money in a year or two
3320,2020-09-06 20:55:58,insfmx,The ultimate insult?
3321,2020-09-06 22:04:25,insfmx,This is gold
3322,2020-09-07 13:04:27,insfmx,Who is Justice Beaver?
3323,2020-09-06 21:41:35,insfmx,"well said, they (and Howie on the radio) have singlehandedly make this team worth following for years. no matter how shitty things get, as long as we still have those booths I will always be a Mets fan"
3324,2020-09-06 22:36:01,insfmx,"I find it really hard to just turn on a game and watch because I just love our booth so much. They‚Äôre amazing. they hype up opposing teams, critique ours when we mess up. I just love how much they love baseball, AND they happen to love my favorite team. 

GKR for the win"
3325,2020-09-07 06:18:15,insfmx,"Ours is a booth that has learned, through much practice, how to make a broadcast interesting when the game is not"
3326,2020-09-07 10:52:58,insfmx,like the guy with the water bottle. that was hilarious
3327,2020-09-06 21:56:33,insfmx,Darling sometimes appears on the tony kornheiser podcast and I really like him.
3328,2020-09-07 00:30:15,insfmx,"Part of Keith's charm is sometimes he does't even listen to what Gary is saying, rather he's in his own world haha. Earlier this season Keith repeated a stat line Gary already said, and Gary sarcastically replied ""Oh, *is that so* "" with them all cracking up."
3329,2020-09-06 22:47:58,insfmx,If I remember correctly it was Gelbs‚Äôs first day back after paternity leave and Gelbs couldn‚Äôt believe they had already forgotten about him and didn‚Äôt even know his name anymore. Too good.
3330,2020-09-07 07:22:03,insfmx,Congrats to Justin Bieber lifting the Stanley Cup and NBA trophy already in his career. Now he moves to the diamond for a Cy Young; man he‚Äôs on a roll!
3331,2020-09-07 07:25:23,insfmx,Just don‚Äôt tattoo your face Biebs. That‚Äôs the last thing baseball needs.
3332,2020-09-07 01:25:08,insfmx,They get really funny when they just start ignoring the game and talking random shit.
3333,2020-09-07 00:13:07,insfmx,"Hear, hear. Couldn't have put it better myself."
3334,2020-09-07 02:58:24,insfmx,"So many times Keith makes an insightful observation, only it was one that Gary had made 10 seconds earlier."
3335,2020-09-07 01:35:02,insfmx,Media guide musings is the best
3336,2020-09-07 02:57:28,insfmx,Nothing beats the Box of Baseball Cards.
3337,2020-09-07 07:26:27,insfmx,When they bust out the wax packs you know the Mets are getting killed and the rest of the game is must see tv
3338,2020-09-06 18:45:48,inqpoh,"IMO being a fan of one genre doesn't exclude liking every genre or music that exist. I feel a lot of people end up not appreciating a lot of music because of this thought. Ive met a lot of people that go like ""Oh, I'm a jazzist, so every other genre is irrelevant"" or ""I like rock, so I can't like pop"".

You'll find amazing things if you're willing to open up and try them."
3339,2020-09-06 19:27:24,inqpoh,"You'd be surprised the number of classic rock/punk/metal (and other genre) bands who were huge fans of Abba.  (Like The Who, John Lennon, Sid Vicious (Sex Pistols), the Rolling Stones, Bruce Springsteen, Led Zeppelin, The Clash...) Kurt Cobain of Nirvana even said when they were touring they kept ABBA Gold on blast throughout the bus ride.  Their reputation in the public can be divisive as some rock snobs disregard them as pop fluff, but among musicians there's a lot of admiration for their compositions which are pretty complex and skillful. There's also some metal covers of Dancing Queen floating around if you search for them."
3340,2020-09-06 18:57:46,inqpoh,"Because yout have good taste,  as does everyone else who likes ABBA."
3341,2020-09-06 22:31:30,inqpoh,ABBA is amazing.
3342,2020-09-06 18:09:15,inqpoh,"I was a hardcore/punk fan during my high school days back in the 80s and I had two guilty pleasures back then...  


ABBA and Mr. Mister with ABBA being the big one.  I used to have metal, punk and hardcore pictures all over my wall and I would sneak in the ladies from ABBA here and there in between the cracks. :P"
3343,2020-09-08 15:44:21,inqpoh,"i love metal, metalcore, hardcore, etc and i rock tf out to ABBA all the time lol"
3344,2020-09-17 19:02:04,inqpoh,"It's hard to describe but I honestly feel there's something in common between metal and ABBA. I always *feel* kind of like I'm listening to metal when I listened to them, scratches a similar itch. Maybe it's something to do with the audio production and rhythms they like to use, like there's an inherent heaviness to their music. Like if ABBA were a building lol, it would have a fancy and colorful fa√ßade but be built with really strong steel supports internally. There's also a lot of precision in the songwriting and sound; precise composition, performance, and recording is very common with metal as well. And the fact that they're basically party music, dgaf music."
3345,2020-09-06 18:58:03,inqpoh,I agree with you. I've also listened to some rap and grime and liked it. I think people should just listen to whatever they enjoy.
3346,2020-09-06 18:59:08,inqpoh,Agreed. Lots of preconceived notions about music keep people from listening to and liking music outside what they think they should.
3347,2020-09-06 19:00:07,inqpoh,Yeah. Guilty pleasures don't exist; either you like something or you don't and I see nothing wrong with that.
3348,2020-09-06 19:03:13,inqpoh,You couldn't have said it better.

Engineering as well but Ford, Volkswagen etc had for sure better engineers but perhaps some of them left to work for Tesla just because of Elon Musk who at the end manage to get the most skilled people around the world who build the most efficient factories and none of this would be possible if a great executive didn't raise his voice and said things that had to be said. All in all the executive might not have the brain to make the engineering but a good executive needs to have the brain to convince the best engineers to accomplish his goals"

3391,2020-10-10 13:12:11,j8cvl0,"In that case, wait until next year, you will see revenue and a market then.  

But the market cap could be $25-50 billion based on forward 5 years earnings (similar to how tech stocks are valued now) and share price is $125- $250 a share."

3404,2020-10-10 19:35:01,j8cvl0,"My apologies. I just checked their latest quarterly report, and they've collected $80M in deposits across those 600 reservations, not $150M. So if 1/3 of the reservations (200 people) have paid their full ticket, accounting for half that deposit money, then on average, everybody else has so far paid $100K. My point stands."

For now, they need to execute in commercialization of suborbital space by finishing the final test flights and sending Richard Branson up."

> Justin Drew Bieber (born March 1, 1994 in London, Ontario, Canada) is a Canadian pop musician, actor, and singer-songwriter. Bieber was discovered in 2008 by American talent manager Scooter Braun, who came across Bieber's videos on YouTube and later became his manager. Braun arranged for him to meet with entertainer Usher Raymond in Atlanta, Georgia. Bieber was signed to Raymond Braun Media Group (RBMG), and then to an Island Records recording contract offered by record executive L.A. Reid.

> His debut extended play, the seven-track My World, was released in November 2009, and was certified platinum in the United States. He became the first artist to have seven songs from a debut record to chart on the Billboard Hot 100. Bieber's first full-length studio album, My World 2.0, was released in March 2010. It debuted at or near number-one in several countries and was certified platinum in the United States. It was preceded by the single Baby. 

> He followed up the release of his debut album with his first headlining tour, the My World Tour, the remix albums My Worlds Acoustic and Never Say Never ‚Äì The Remixes, and the 3D biopic-concert film Justin Bieber: Never Say Never. Bieber released his second studio album Under the Mistletoe in November 2011, when it debuted at number-one on the Billboard 200. Bieber released his third studio album Believe on June 19, 2012, and it became his fourth chart topper in the United States, debuting at number-one on the Billboard 200.

> Bieber has received numerous awards, including both Artist of the Year Awards at the 2010 American Music Awards and the 2012 American Music Awards, and was nominated for Best New Artist and Best Pop Vocal Album at the 53rd Grammy Awards. With a global fan base, termed as ""Beliebers"", and over 40 million followers on Twitter, he was named by Forbes magazine in 2012 as the third-most powerful celebrity in the world. However, in 2013 he fell to number 9. 

> On the 25th of December 2013,  Bieber's second concert film biopic, called Justin Bieber's Believe, was released. As a lead-up to the film, 10 songs were released every Monday for 10 consecutive weeks. The tracks were all featured on a digital collection album tilted Journals.

> On the 13th of November 2015, Justin released ""Purpose"", his most personal album to date. The album received Billboard #1's with ""Love Yourself"", ""Sorry"" and ""What Do You Mean?"", also striking a ""Top Package"" award from Billboard Touring Awards for the Purpose World Tour.

> Bieber released his fifth studio album, Changes on February 14, 2020.

This doesn't necessarily mean they're bad people just that if they can't conform with today's standards means that they'll ruin their reputation and lives. I remember Terry Crew came under fire for responding to a tweet that children could be raided without having both a mother and a father to which he relied on that such an upbringing would result in that child being deficiently raised. He later apologized and said he was only speaking as a father how had experienced child neglect from his father but that didn't get him completely out of the fire. 

Know back to Justin Bieber and the gay-bashing back when I was growing up that was just the norm and defending such people might you came under fire to so people who had come about it either ignored the issue or took apart in just enough to be socially accepted. Alot of people may say people how did what I just described was shitty (if they are Gen-Zs or older they more then likely took part in it too if they're being honest) but that's easy to claim to offer yourself as a martyr when you know you're not going to suffer any social stigma for standing up."

Literally. They do not know better most of the time, or their parents don‚Äôt bother making sure their sweet little angel hasn‚Äôt turned into a walking waste of space. 

Children will not learn the proper social graces we expect from them unless we teach them. 

Some people never stop being children. 

Some people who never stop being children also never stop being ignorant. 

When you mix childish ignorance with pride you get some very angry and proud people who can‚Äôt read. 

No offense to anyone who can‚Äôt read. Although. How?

Jokes aside. 

It‚Äôs seriously an education problem. 

People who say shit like, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs so gay‚Äù, the insult of choice for the teenagers I knew, don‚Äôt realize that it‚Äôs insulting to have your way of life turned into an insult. 

Does it matter if we weren‚Äôt actually referring to someone‚Äôs sexuality, and instead used it as a ‚Äúcatch all‚Äù term for anything ‚Äúout of the ordinary‚Äù?

No!

We were being ignorant little shitheads and disrespected an entire portion of our community. 

Did the gay kids care?

Honestly half of them called us gay right back. 

Does that make it ok?

No. No one‚Äôs culture or identity should be an insult unless that culture or identity is based on ignorance. 

Want to know why so many white people were pissed off enough to vote for Trump? Because he stands for protecting ignorance. 

Republicans and conservative Christians want no one to be taught what they don‚Äôt want to learn. 

No dude. That‚Äôs literally preaching ignorance. You gotta learn the fundamental truths about the world. 

Jeebus don‚Äôt count as a fundamental truth."

I know it seems like I'm making excuses for those people and trust me I understand to an extent what those people went through (I was diagnosed with autism when I was 4 and I've never been mocked and discriminated against my whole life for my behaviors). But times were different and peer pressure shapes our beliefs more than people care to admit. Also, Christianity extremism back in the day when religion we more relevant pushed people towards gay-bashing. (Not that day is much different. I've seen people claim that white people are inherently racist because of their genes. Then there are people like the writer behind She-Ra remake's wife who encouraged violence towards white men.)"

1. Prevents me from literally being blasphemous as I said Jebus, not Jesus, so I have not ‚Äútaken the lord‚Äôs name in vain‚Äù. Swearing using a name for part of God, at least in the sect of Christianity I grew up in, was a big no no. 

2. It makes really religious people mad because it appears disrespectful to so closely toe the line of blasphemy while also obviously referring to their religion.

3453,2020-11-09 18:30:23,jqz99o,"I don't really know when you were in middle school, but when I was in middle school there were pretty much two types of people: the ones that thought being super masculine was cool and femininity was gay and gay was bad, and then there was the group that thought femininity was cool and gay was cool. There was also a small contingent of people that just didn't really care about your femininity. My guess is you only heard from the ""femininity is bad"" crowd.

I don‚Äôt have to be. I could respect their religious doctrine even though I‚Äôm a non practitioner. 

I could leave them to enjoy their peaceful religion. 

If they were being peaceful I would totally give up all my annoyance with ignorant religious people in the United States. 

To be entirely fair to them, it is not only religion that is the issue. I am fairly certain any religion would be facing similar issues given the historical context. 

A bunch of racists decided the easiest way to stop progress was to make everyone equally ignorant. 

And now we are here. 

Is that Christianity‚Äôs fault?

No.

I just don‚Äôt really see how any ‚Äúgood Christians‚Äù could vote for a bigot. 

Oh right. We couldn‚Äôt prove Trump is a bigot. Somehow. 

So Christians in the United States elected someone they could ‚Äúlook away from‚Äù when he was ‚Äúacting out‚Äù but ‚Äúat least he said what we were thinking.‚Äù

I‚Äôm sorry. 

Did he?

I don‚Äôt think anyone of any creed should lie on national television, have documented affairs out of wedlock, say he would bed his own daughter were they not related, lie about the seriousness of a global pandemic.

We really can‚Äôt prove any religion wrong. Same way I can‚Äôt prove that there aren‚Äôt tiny worlds within our atoms, and that we are in fact living inside an atomic element within the giant body of the universe. Which is also of course within its own super structure we would call the 5th dimension. 

Right?

Can‚Äôt prove it either way. 

Even if my off the cuff completely made up science sounding malarkey hits close to the mark, it was just a random guess. 

We still won‚Äôt know what happened ‚Äúafter‚Äù. So religion will always have a niche to fill in human life. 

Is there a whole bunch of made up stuff tacked onto the basic premise of, ‚Äúafter we die X happens, so be a good person‚Äù?

Yeah. But that‚Äôs the core of most successful religions, and it always will be. 

Do some religions get way too into what ‚Äúgood‚Äù is? Yeah. Every group has its extremists. As long as we make sure people are educated and understand basic facts about life they will be less likely to hate.

that being said, these numbers arent bad at all. anti by rihanna debuted w 166k and that was a huge album. And 100k-300k has always been where ariana falls when it comes to album sales. like rihanna, shes known to the public more for her hit singles and personality. not really concerned about it, and it feels like she is starting to step out the box at her own pace. my hair and love language are clear indications that shes growing and not stalled creatively like many reviews try to say."
3504,2020-11-09 13:09:52,jqrqml,"firstly, she still got a #1. that's huge and congrats to her. 

there are a few factors behind the low sales. i think the two most important ones are the new billboard rules and the timing of the drop. 

the new rules don't count merch or tour ticket bundling, and physical copies count the week they're shipped rather than the week they're sold. this is especially impactful for vinyls, as those sell a lot but they take forever to manufacture. with the new rules, taylor's folklore drop isn't doable any more (tons of merch bundles, 16 different physical versions, selling vinyls that aren't made yet and won't ship for 3 months). ari didn't even do preorders, positions had 7 physical versions and one lot of signed CDs that sold out in under an hour. i think if she'd had preorders and vinyls ready, numbers would have been higher.

in terms of timing, i think the election definitely played a role. i'm not american but multiple americans on popheads mentioned listening to very little music last week because they were just tuned into CNN 24/7. i'd be curious to know the impact of the election on listening as a whole, maybe spotify will release numbers. 

other factors are the minimal promo (some social media stuff and one zach sang interview), the lack of pop banger lead single, and the style being different from tun. she's also always been quite low with pure sales.

that said, i think it's fairly clear that she wanted a low-key era. she chose the timing, she clearly wasn't aiming for another culturally impactful moment like tun releasing the weekend before the election. there's a lot more promo and sales stuff she could have done but didn't. i interpret that as her not being too bothered about making this a huge moment, and a continuation of her just release music when she wants to vibe."
3505,2020-11-09 11:24:29,jqrqml,I think her life being ‚Äúnormal‚Äù right now has a lot to do with it to. Taylor dropped that album and everyone knew there would def be references to scooter and the label stuff. Sweetener and tun happened after really big events in aris life. Right now she‚Äôs in a good ‚Äúuneventful‚Äù time in her life so she‚Äôs probably not as interesting to random people if that makes sense. But positions hands down is one of my fav albums
3506,2020-11-09 20:41:53,jqrqml,"i mean, sales are dead but positions was handled terribly. the fact that it got leaked was bad, the album cover was lazy and the album as a whole was lacking in quality, sorry. i know it‚Äôs covid but the promo was horrible too. she could have done something more like idk, a livestream."
3507,2020-11-09 05:38:39,jqrqml,Bundles rule
3508,2020-11-09 05:37:07,jqrqml,"it is interesting. i personally loved the album as well (it‚Äôs my favorite one overall!), but I think the GP was probably expecting something on the same level as TUN. i assume because it was so iconic and even people who weren‚Äôt ariana grande fans had heard about it. that being said i‚Äôm so glad she went with her heart and made an album like this instead of playing it safe"
3509,2020-11-09 08:44:59,jqrqml,"Bundles such as signed cd's and any other additional items Included in the album total sales such as the alternative album covers were not included in the total sales. Positions has the highest one-week total for an album since bundles stopped factoring into chart and sales rankings. however, the new bundle rule came into place last month and not many huge artists on Ariana's level have released since then so that's not saying much lol. 

I do think the reasoning for low sales is becaue she played it very safe. The production and lyrics in tun were very impressive, however for positions they were mediocre and no songs really had a wow factor like most did in tun. 

Also the album leaked 4 days before the release date and almost everyone had already listened to the album and that would have had a big effect on the total sales.

Also it's worth noting positions had more first week streams that all her other albums bar tun (obviously lol). I believe we are in the streaming era and more people are streaming on platforms like Spotify and apple music rather than actually buying an album. Ariana is definitely a streaming artist and not an album seller. This could also be down to the fact the majority of her fans are from the current generation. Someone like Adele would have big pure album sales but maybe not as high pure streaming sales becaue her fans are from the older generation."
3510,2020-11-09 12:41:48,jqrqml,She should have prepped tons of bundles like signed CDs or even vinyl etc
3511,2020-11-09 15:50:38,jqrqml,"The pure sales is obvious. 

Streaming wise, I‚Äôd say a combo of the lead single not immediately sticking the landing for *a lot* of people, plus - that‚Äôs right - the whole thing leaked almost a week in advance, and *a lot* of people listened to it. 

I‚Äôm tempted to say over saturation played a role too, but her tweet got over a million likes, almost a million retweets etc. Seems to me like enough people didn‚Äôt care for the lead and skipped the album altogether. 

Who knowssssss exactly why tho"
3512,2020-11-09 05:46:52,jqrqml,I blame Scooter
3513,2020-11-09 07:27:41,jqrqml,"You're right. I think both worked as promo tactics. Ari using two weeks and a single as promo, Taylor using dropping the album in less than a day as promo. Each of them did their part of doing promo. But the success of their projects varied drastically. 

Hmm, but compared to Ari's past albums, she sold 300k for TUN and 200k for Swt. 100k is a big difference from 300k. It's practically half of what her last album did. She's lower than DW numbers back in 2016 when she's at the top of the game now. 100k to 300k is a huge range. 

I agree that My Hair is jazzy and unlike what she's done before. I enjoyed that. Yet the fact that most reviews feel like she's playing safe does indicate that she hasn't progressed much creatively. 

To me, I think progress is overrated. I dont mind if she dabbles the same genres over and over again as long as the music continues to sound good. I don't care much for evolution as long as the quality stays, but I guess the GP does."
3514,2020-12-11 10:17:49,jqrqml,"To be fair, Taylor's had big sales for years. She's always been more of an album artist, whereas Ariana is a singles artist"
3515,2020-11-09 11:38:04,jqrqml,"I absolutely agree. I think I've mentioned it before on other posts but it's sad that an artist's relevancy is tied to an extent to a tumultuous personal life. With a greater downfall comes greater highs and greater investment from the GP. 

I hate grief porn but I think a lot of the fanbase is guilty of that even though I know they don't have any ill intentions. I try my best not to indulge myself in that, which means I always ignore any possible references to Mac in her music. I don't care to know or discover it. I'd much rather let him rest in peace and enjoy her music for what it is."
3516,2020-11-09 20:50:56,jqrqml,"I‚Äôm sorry but reducing Taylor‚Äôs strength in album sales to just being about scooter and the label stuff seems extremely wrong. Especially folklore is a critically acclaimed album that took people by surprised and the fact that we didn‚Äôt even know she was referencing those things until we heard the album close enough (I certainly wasn‚Äôt expecting her to sing about it and also those things were referenced only in like 2 songs at best). The reason why Taylor has strong album sales AND streaming numbers wasn‚Äôt because people were interested in her personal life. She literally said folklore isn‚Äôt about her personal life (although you can make some connections about her personal life). Again, reducing Taylor‚Äôs hard work and taking a risk to switch from a pretty poppy album like reputation and lover to a more subdued album like folklore seems insulting. Of course maybe that‚Äôs not what you meant but the idea is; you make good music, people will listen to it, it doesn‚Äôt matter if some big event happened in the artist‚Äôs life or not."
3517,2020-11-09 05:45:00,jqrqml,Ariana did do signed CDs if I'm not wrong
3518,2020-11-09 05:42:09,jqrqml,"That's an interesting take. I agree that they expected TUN level of quality, and didn't get that. 

But the funny thing is, a lot of reviews say that she's playing it too safe in Positions. For example, I found this here:

https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/nov/08/ariana-grande-positions-review"
3519,2020-11-09 08:53:36,jqrqml,"I see. That was an interesting and insightful take. I agree with many of your points. Thank you for sharing!!

(And omg I remember the leak now. That's probably one good reason.)"
3520,2020-11-09 15:51:39,jqrqml,Can‚Äôt do that anymore unless everything is ready to ship on release week.
3521,2020-11-09 15:54:16,jqrqml,"Yeah, you're right, I keep forgetting about the leaks. That played a part too, for sure. :(

Yeah, I went to popheads and a lot of people were confused how her Tweet announcing the album got a million likes but her album sales didn't exactly match that. Beats me too"
3522,2020-11-09 05:51:47,jqrqml,Why? Why do we have to blame her manager instead of holding the artist herself accountable to a degree? I don't want to blindly idolize someone to the point that I'd always push the blame to somebody else
3523,2020-11-09 15:08:37,jqrqml,"Hmm I think there were a whole bunch of reasons for one Taylor was able to use merch bundles before the rule came into effect that they wouldn‚Äôt count as sales, also the fact Ariana‚Äôs album leaked days before it dropped, then it being election week she wasn‚Äôt really posting much about it either, also I think if she had dropped another video to go with the album release that would‚Äôve helped alot, but I would say Ariana‚Äôs release was a lot more messy then Folklore‚Äôs release, for me the music was great but the rollout was awful and idk what Scooter was thinking with this..."
3524,2020-11-09 05:50:40,jqrqml,"ehh she didn‚Äôt even signed a lot, and taylor‚Äôs album dropped right before the rule was set there was a bunch of different versions of her album on release and ariana didn‚Äôt even have a preorder link for this album as well. Billboard also said this was the highest one week total since the bundles stopped, so this low number was expected for me."
3525,2020-11-09 05:55:32,jqrqml,"Imo she did play it safe. She made an album in which she slightly departed from her usual stuff but still managed to sound like a bunch of music that could have effortlessly fit in previous projects. It obviously wasn't bad, but even some of her most devoted fans can recognize that it wasn't something fresh"
3526,2020-11-09 05:45:31,jqrqml,ooh yeah I actually can see that point as well! I guess I assumed a more typical pop sound would be considered ‚Äúsafe‚Äù but reading that I definitely can see their point!
3527,2020-11-09 15:53:22,jqrqml,That was my point
3528,2020-11-09 08:23:30,jqrqml,Lol it's always when an artist does bad blame the management but when an artist does good all credit to the artist
3529,2020-11-09 05:56:30,jqrqml,"You may be right, but you're indicating that this lack of a merch bundle option accounted for about 200k worth of difference of sales compared to TUN, or 600k difference in sales from Folklore? Taylor had an edge with the merch bundles, yes, but Ari had two weeks of hype to build before the album release, and Taylor had less than a day. Ari also had a single out a week before.

While it might explain Ari's drop in sales, this huge decline cannot be attributed fully to that."
3530,2020-11-09 17:26:02,jqrqml,"Oof my bad, missed ‚Äúprepped.‚Äù Got you."
3531,2020-11-09 08:24:11,jqrqml,Agree lmao
3532,2020-11-09 06:01:34,jqrqml,"Your right on that one because many thought this would have been another thank u next, but obviously it wasn‚Äôt. But Taylor is one of those artists where she always does well when it comes to album sales, nothing like ariana so I wouldn‚Äôt use her as an example since she will always come on top."
3533,2020-11-09 12:59:20,jqrqml,"in all fairness, sales are literally her manager's job. blaming scooter for the music being crap is unfair, blaming scooter for the sales being low is more justified. as a whole though, people do demonise scooter a lot."
3534,2020-11-09 06:06:25,jqrqml,"Yes, it definitely wasn't TUN level. I agree with you.

Hmm, I believe that credit should be given when credit is due. Lover didn't do that well for Taylor's standards even though Taylor went ham with promoting it, but Folklore almost matched Lover in sales even though she barely did promo. Not even Taylor is infallible. If your album is good, it'll do well. That was the case for Folklore.

But Positions fell hard from TUN in terms of sales. If we're comparing Ari with her past works, it's not good either."
3535,2020-11-09 13:01:11,jqrqml,Sales can be low because music is crap though. I don't think Positions is crap (FAR FROM IT) but musical quality plays a massive role in sales.
3536,2020-11-09 06:11:47,jqrqml,"But it‚Äôs like why compare her old numbers when u can just enjoy what she got now üò≠, of course it‚Äôs not gonna do similar numbers if people don‚Äôt like it. At the end she‚Äôs still number 1 whether the numbers were high or low."
3537,2020-11-09 13:12:19,jqrqml,"oh yeah for sure, but imo sales have a lot more to do with promotion and strategy. a lot of crap albums have sold loads of copies because of a few good singles and strong marketing. i'm just saying this is one area where it's not entirely unreasonable to assign some responsibility to her manager."
3538,2020-11-09 06:15:56,jqrqml,"Hmm, because I am interested in what the GP thinks of her works. As a fan I'm super biased towards her stuff so I always find it great, but I don't want to just stay in my biased bubble. I want to hear perspectives that might clash with my own. It helps me look at her works with new perspectives and thoughts"
3539,2020-11-09 13:34:12,jqrqml,"I think Scooter would have wanted Ari to do more promo, but she probably didn't want to. She's much less invested in charts than he is, or has at least indicated so during interviews. I don't think we should really point fingers at him because an artist as big as Ari probably has her own agency that he can't do much about."

It's hard to make friends because I'm never sure if it's the same person. I can remember pictures though for a while. Growing up was strange because at family gatherings I didn't know who was talking to me. And going to the mall was a nightmare..

I've learned to rely on small details and context clues, but if I haven't seen or heard someone for a while and bump into them somewhere I'd never expect to then it's really disorienting."

I also like older male celebrities and don‚Äôt find many celebrity males my age all that appealing. But I do like dating men my close to my age. 

Some people just have a preference and it sounds like you just like older men."
3662,2020-11-08 20:14:29,jqhegj,"It seems we have pretty much the same preferences. But I would be hesitant to immediately blame daddy issues. Is the whole concept of ""daddy issues"" even accepted by modern psychology? People seem to use that phrase a lot, not just when a woman likes older men. If she‚Äôs into BDSM, she has daddy issues.  If she‚Äôs promiscuous, daddy issues, if she‚Äôs not promiscuous, daddy issues! If she‚Äôs too clingy, if she‚Äôs too distant... It just seems to be a term people throw around. Personally, I wouldn‚Äôt worry too much about it.

What you should ask yourself is whether or not your attraction to older men is a good or a bad thing. Have you been in a relationship with an older man before? Do you want a relationship like that?  Big age gap relationships have a pretty bad reputation, and while there certainly can be a power inbalance, that doesn‚Äôt always have to be the case. Believe it or not, many of those relationships can work. Not to mention, the more you age, the less you will think about age gaps, anyway. 

P-S: Not being attracted to Justin Bieber is COMPLETELY normal."

3667,2020-11-08 18:30:03,jqeng5,What the actual fuck did I just watch? Clickbait title for sure.
3668,2020-11-08 15:39:30,jqdauj,"Bieber was huge when they were trainees and continues to be a huge star today. He may be...controversial but nothing's wrong with liking his songs. 

Literally most of the K-pop artists I follow have expressed their undying love for Yummy, so the NCT guys not alone."
3669,2020-11-08 17:38:03,jqdauj,"I will take Justin Bieber any day over Chris Brown who seems to be very popular among kpop idols.  Luckily none of them mentioned him in the Nylon article.

Also, Purpose was a great album.  We don‚Äôt talk about ‚ÄúYummy‚Äù or Changes in this house, but to each their own I suppose."
3670,2020-11-08 15:26:37,jqdauj,üôÑ and then ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
3671,2020-11-08 16:02:06,jqdauj,"I think many of them, especially Mark, could relate to JB starting out young and having all this pressure on him. Especially considering how many of the neos mentioned JB‚Äôs new song Lonely. I think they can relate

I think Mark could also identify with JB being Canadian and Christian like him. Mark also mentioned his favorite song was Purpose even back in 2017, with the Dreamies performing it in Dream Show in 2018 in his honor."
3672,2020-11-08 16:55:26,jqdauj,Justin makes music ‚Äî> they like it.
3673,2020-11-08 17:02:18,jqdauj,I think it probs means they like his music
3674,2020-11-08 15:26:00,jqdauj,Because he‚Äôs popular internationally and some of his songs are good and relatable for some.
3675,2020-11-08 22:03:14,jqdauj,"Honestly anything pre- and including Purpose was a total hit for me. It‚Äôs only been the past two years that I really can‚Äôt stand anything he does. His personality and behaviour makes me actively avoid his music, which I don‚Äôt do for many artists (especially when I enjoy their music).

I can‚Äôt blame them for liking him I guess because he hasn‚Äôt done anything outright inexcusable. Better than any time a kpop idol likes Chris Brown."
3676,2020-11-08 19:50:44,jqdauj,I hate it but I also went to his concert when he came to my city so who am I to say anything lmao. Also Love jungwoo and renjun for being fellow directioners <33
3677,2020-11-09 13:00:22,jqdauj,"Wasn't bothered, still starry-eyed from finding out that Jungwoo is a fellow directioner ü§©

But in all seriousness - liking an artist's music doesn't have to be that deep. I try to separate the art from the artist in most cases. John Lennon was an asshole, but I'll still listen to Imagine ya know?"
3678,2020-11-09 01:26:52,jqdauj,Probably because they listened to him a lot (intentionally or not). Renjun said that you can hear justin bieber songs playing on every floor in sm when they were trainees
3679,2020-11-09 14:59:04,jqdauj,"He was a teenage popstar while the boys were trainees. Of course they'd listen to him. 

Not to mention they probably relate a lot as Justin is the prime example of what can go wrong when you have a spotlight on your life from when you were a child. He had it rough and he's not the best person, but you could see how young teenage boys preparing to be singers would look at him and like him.

Also, his old music slaps yo"
3680,2020-11-08 22:05:26,jqdauj,"Are you me? But seriously, everything you said I agree with 100%."
3681,2020-11-08 16:15:46,jqdauj,"lmao my mood exactly. I understand it though, I‚Äôm around their age and also used to like JB a lot when I was younger. I think they might only know him as a musician/performer and they look up to him because he also started his career when he was young. Personally I find it a bit disappointing but what are we gonna do about it, maybe Bieber‚Äôs behavior isn‚Äôt really well known in SK or they just don‚Äôt care (concerning though). Nonetheless, that‚Äôs a a bit of a controversial reference for sure."
3682,2020-11-10 04:13:36,jqdauj,"Most of the neos actually mentioned the song Holy but yeah, I def agree on the Mark part."
3683,2020-11-10 04:18:44,jqdauj,"I was never a stan but I used to like him and some of his music until he bullied Taylor Swift lmao. I don't hate him though, just been avoiding him and his music for a while. 

Yeah! I see so many other k-pop idols who like Chris Brown. It really sucks."
3684,2020-11-10 04:21:56,jqdauj,"I was surprised about Jungwoo and Renjun being directioners. That's really cool. And, Sungchan's favorite artist is Shawn Mendes!"
3685,2020-11-20 07:27:49,jqdauj,"Bit late, but I think that although JB's behavior in the past was undoubtedly problematic, he has definitely grown up. I used to absolutely detest him based off of his behavior; but as I grew up and became more aware of the pressures of being famous at a young age, I can see how that can mess with you really badly. You can definitely hear his concerns and pain in the lyrics of his songs now. I think that's something that only celebrities can really understand."
3686,2020-11-10 04:23:11,jqdauj,This is what I thought too. Thank you.
3687,2020-11-10 04:15:02,jqdauj,"I meant not just in this interview. Lucas, Ten, Xiaojun and Yangyang also shared the song Lonely on various social media accounts."
3688,2020-11-10 09:03:10,jqdauj,"Jungwoo and Renjun, guys after my own heart hahaha"

3702,2020-12-15 17:59:15,kdkuei,I don‚Äôt know but I‚Äôve also read Mars square pluto is super aggressive and can be violent.
3703,2020-12-15 18:23:52,kdkuei,"I think it definitely indicates people being obsessively and almost dangerously attracted to him. Not to mention that Pluto sits right on his ascendent which just amplifies his sex appeal. 

I feel like because it is Mars square Pluto, he could come off very sexy and mysterious and he could draw people in that want to obsess over him but since his Mars in Aquarius, he is probably way more detached and emotionally unavailable than women would hope. 

Just my take."

A Christmas Duel by The Hives & Cyndi Lauper is the best Christmas song about adultery and mild arson.

Believe In Me by Fun came out before they got big, and that's probably why it never caught on. Which I personally think is a shame because it's a really fun, seasonal, indie rock jam."

3790,2020-12-15 07:55:51,kd75mr,OMG this song was pretty good as far as cheesy Christmas songs go. I forgot about it!
3791,2020-12-14 23:03:53,kd75mr,Omg what??? This used to be on the radio allll the time. It‚Äôs one of my fav Christmas songs!!! She did her thing.

3794,2020-12-15 02:57:25,kd75mr,I remember watching this video constantly as a kid. I went to Christmas Queens in New York (a Christmas themed Drag Race show) a couple years ago and they played this song before the show. I remember seeing two guys hugging and swaying while lip syncing and to this day that‚Äôs is the gayest thing I have ever seen

3798,2020-12-15 03:24:56,kd75mr,My favorite Christmas song! Cyndi Lauper and Alison Kraus released a beautiful duet to this a few years ago and RuPaul and Michelle Visage have a great version from the 90s too
3799,2020-12-15 02:16:00,kd75mr,I love Another Lonely Christmas by Prince. The extended version is amazing. It‚Äôs sad that more people don‚Äôt know about it.

Its really appropriate for this year's crappy covid feeling's I think."

3805,2020-12-16 02:54:05,kd75mr,Discovered that song this year! The lalalalove lines are my favorite. Kelly really kills the pre chorus.
3806,2020-12-15 13:52:05,kd75mr,I love her version but I have to say that my favorite cover of Last Christmas is by Darren Hayes from Savage Garden.
3807,2020-12-15 10:10:49,kd75mr,"Christina‚Äôs version is the one i hear most often, it feels correct because it‚Äôs the best one"

3809,2020-12-14 21:50:29,kd75mr,Go into literally any store or turn on any pop radio station - chances are after listening for less than an hour you‚Äôll hear it. It‚Äôs definitely a modern Christmas staple.
3810,2020-12-14 21:43:46,kd75mr,"It‚Äôs literally #25 on Spotify right now...? Idk if it gets played on radio but I hear it on playlists, Xmas parties, and open mic nights/online covers every year."

3813,2020-12-15 13:54:45,kd75mr,The gay intern wanted to make his shift more enjoyable
3814,2020-12-14 23:35:27,kd75mr,Really? I‚Äôve never heard this song on the radio in my life and that includes work where they play Christmas music 24/7 for the whole December. I‚Äôm glad it got the recognition at some point though!! Definitely in my top 3 Christmas songs of all time.
3815,2020-12-15 01:52:03,kd75mr,"This comes on Sirius XM radio a lot for
me I love it!"
3816,2020-12-15 02:51:20,kd75mr,"True!!! I was so shocked that this was the top answer because every supermarket and department store plays this, AIWFCIY and Santa Tell Me on loop lol"

i need to get out more... or not since we're in a damn pandemic and the government is doing fuck all about it >\_>"
3818,2020-12-15 01:02:22,kd75mr,Lol same. It's one of the few songs that gets me in the Holiday spirit.

Well done geeza hope all is getting better now boss"
3854,2020-12-14 12:40:29,kcumf4,"It helps to know that other people have experienced this exact thing. I was tripping with my friends and only me and one other guy had tripped before. The rest were trying it for the first time. We get to hour 2 and one of our friends isn‚Äôt really feeling the effects and the other experienced tripper suggests we go out and smoke. We all smoked too much. Even if I wasn‚Äôt on two tabs that would‚Äôve been too much. But I was ok, just a bit spacey with some heavy visuals and pretty distant. I know how to let myself know not to freak out and just remember that I‚Äôm tripping. But my friends who were tripping for the first time... my god one of them thought he was saying some profound and funny but he was literally just saying the same things over and over again and it was driving me crazy. I know that feeling now of not being able to do anything about the other persons trip if they start to freak out and you just feel helpless. It‚Äôs genuinely a mind fuck and it feels like you‚Äôre going insane. At one point he just starts eating Nutella. Not even on bread, he just grabs a spoon and a plate and is just stuffing down a mountain of Nutella he put onto the plate. Always have a trip sitter. An experienced one too so they know how to not kill the mood."
3855,2020-12-14 10:37:03,kcumf4,"Wow, that sounds like it was really intense. I think in the moment you did the right thing to involve people that could ""help"". Luckly none of you got hurt, maybe a bit scarred mentally. I hope for your own sake that you are more careful next time and have a better set and setting. 

As it sounds of how you explained the situation, and where and how you guys tripped, that the chance of having a bad trip was high. First of all, idk how many times both of you have done it or in what places, but tripping in a basement when his parents/family was home was a bad idea. Kinda sounds like you guys didn't plan ahead well enough to give yourselfs atleast 12 hours of not being interrupted. 

I have only done acid twice, so I don't have too much experience. However I did research beforehand and took set and setting seriously. I had 3 other friends with me that had previous experience with lsd, so that helped too. Each time, we were in a cabin, far away from where we live, still a familiar place and overall a good location, and free of disturbances. By the end of this week I will go on my 3rd trip. Imo you should treat lsd as at least a 2 day trip, preferrably 3 day trip, give yourself a day beforehand to prepare for the trip. Then trip, and the 3rd day you can reflect on the trip and relax. That's just how I have and will approach lsd, anything other than that is for me, irresponsible. I don't feel comfortable taking lsd in unfamiliar places and where I could be disturbed. 

So yeah, set and setting, don't forget that. Take the time you need right now to process this, and hopefully learn a lot from it and how you could avoid such an experience. 
Stay safe and take care!"
3856,2020-12-14 19:17:06,kcumf4,"A bad trip is bound to happen at some point if you trip several times in your life. All it takes is a bad trip or two to never have a bad trip again. Just gotta shake the fleas off. Never had a bad trip on acid but a couple on shrooms. 4 weeks ago, I ate some really really potent shrooms with 2 of my friends. I thought 3.5 was a dosage I could tolerate considering how ‚Äúexperienced‚Äù I am. Haha, I was proven arrogant as fuuuck. I hallucinated demons eating me alive. I thought I died and stopped breathing. I thought my friends went insane, killed me and hung me up in a tree. I thought my friends were demons and convincing me to lay in the bon fire to free myself from all the suffering. I thought I went insane and could visually see my friends with slit throats dead af in the back of there car. I thought I had killed myself. I thought I called 911 and the paramedic carried me into an ambulance. Like I could hear the paramedics but couldn‚Äôt see them. I hallucinated demon face laughing at me and shit like that. And then finally I ‚Äúcommunicated with the aliens and gave me a mission‚Äù which was lit af. But either way I learned a lot from this trip and I got a lot to work on before I trip again. It may take a couple years before I complete the ‚Äúmission‚Äù. But I‚Äôm not tripping until I know I‚Äôm worthy, pure and freed from my fears. Sometimes, you just need to get punished to learn."

3865,2020-12-19 13:47:58,kcumf4,"So I just had my trip yesterday, just got up from bed. I had a very similar situation with what you described in your post. I feel your pain, and how scared you must have been. I know I was so scared for my life that I forgot what reality was I thought I turned insane, the same as my friend. He kinda went psychotic and there was nothing I could do. I tried to calm him down but nothing. He is twice my weight and he just kept charging at me, I could not stop at all. It was horrible. At that time when he broke down and just sat in one place for at least 4 hours, after that I felt like I died, gave up on life, I did not know if I was alive or not, I did not care at all. After that, I had the absolute best time of my life. I learned so much, and I was so grateful to just be sitting there observing, and having fun with myself. I felt truly free for the first time. It was a really, really difficult trip, but a well needed one. Btw took 4 tabs of supposedly 150ug. And I didn't want to take that much, it was kinda like I felt something bad might happen. However my friends kinda forced my to take 4 tabs, and I am really grateful, it truly opened my eyes."

3867,2020-12-19 04:22:58,kcumf4,"I can imagine.. It sounds fucking crazy, I've read similar stories, and they all got one thing in common, the guy who get's ""crazy"" psychotic or whatever you wanna call it always smokes alot of weed before or way to early in the trip. 

I've tried smoking early on in a trip before, just makes my thoughs race a million mph and makes me unable to speak, not fun at all. But yeah, look in to it, benzos are great trip killers. I've only used em once, when me and my brother tripped on 300 mcg for our first time, we tripped so hard we coudn't put our thoughts into words, so we to a quarter of a pill each, and in 15 minutes, we were still tripping hard with laughs, visuals and all, but with just enough controll over our thoughts that we could communicate. 

I like to call them trip killers, lol, some people use them as medication, some use them to get a high, but they're good for nothing, other than killing trips. 

Btw, you handeled the situation like a fucking boss, you did everything right. Creds!"

3869,2020-12-30 15:47:25,kn2lep,"in addition to loving/disliking, i would suggest adding things to your library. i listen to a mix of english/french/japanese and AM is pretty good about recommending a mix of all three to me."
3870,2020-12-31 12:37:02,kn2lep,"From my experience, AM‚Äôs algorithm is like the slow kid in class. It‚Äôll reach the point where it understands your taste, but it‚Äôs that... slow. I‚Äôm mainly a rock/punk listener (although I do listen to random stuff from other genres) and at first I had the same issue as you, as I would get recommendations from reggeaton, pop, country and maybe 1 or 2 rock songs (that I may or may not like). After ~4 months it did start to pick my tastes and now (5, almost 6 months) most of my recommended songs are rock and I usually do like most of them. 

YMMV, as I wasn‚Äôt that active on the dislike/like features (although I did my fair bit), so it may pick up its pace with you faster than it did with me.

I also feel like it‚Äôs maybe a bit lazy? As said, almost everything that I get on recommended is rock, even if I sometimes I do listen to other genres, so while I wouldn‚Äôt want to get spammed again with pop, maybe 1 or 2 interesting songs would be nice"

Check your post now. Does it have spaces around the dash "" - "", and does it have the [genre]?    

Forgetting these points are almost definitely why it was removed.

3940,2020-12-29 22:11:19,kmo7u2,oh god has the hot 100 list ever been this dominated by christmas songs before
3941,2020-12-29 22:20:24,kmo7u2,"rip blinding lights it was a good run, really thought it would last until 2021 though.        
wonder if any songs off WLR will chart next week (my guess is not, mayyybe the song with cudi).    
also feel like that meg/dababy song is gonna be a slow climber but eventually reach top 30"
3942,2020-12-29 23:45:27,kmo7u2,I kinda like how the xmss songs takeover the charts. It cleans the sheet for the new year.
3943,2020-12-29 22:17:36,kmo7u2,"It'll be interesting to see how the charts recover next week when all the Christmas songs drop off. I'm not sure how much of WLR will chart, the top song has only got 3 mil plays on Spotify as of today."
3944,2020-12-30 00:36:18,kmo7u2,"First Christmas without a girlfriend in 4 years . Both our families aren‚Äôt Christian so we don‚Äôt celebrate it with them but when we were together we would celebrate like in a secular American relationshipy way. Anyways what I‚Äôm saying, WLR is the Christmas album I needed this year"
3945,2020-12-30 04:53:52,kmo7u2,"Almost 40 songs on the top 100 are Christmas. They have to do something about ""seasonal"" music. Its holding back alot of artists from the achievement of charting. Artists are going to quit dropping music in December so they don't have to compete with Christmas music"
3946,2020-12-30 02:22:54,kmo7u2,they should really do something about the christmas songs on the charts in this new streaming era. when Mariah Carey went number 1 last year on a 25 year old song it was kinda cute but having the whole top 10 being dominated by christmas songs is tiring
3947,2020-12-30 00:26:22,kmo7u2,I don‚Äôt think this is the week of January 02 right?
3948,2020-12-30 05:26:09,kmo7u2,The fact that Christmas in Hollis can't get on this list during Christmas time infuriates me. Let's get some good Christmas music on this list
3949,2020-12-30 00:19:50,kmo7u2,Last year was the start
3950,2020-12-30 02:04:20,kmo7u2,People‚Äôs obsession with Christmas music is something I‚Äôll never understand. Is it a religious/Christian thing?
3951,2020-12-29 23:29:44,kmo7u2,"If WLR sells ~125k I feel like a couple of songs will chart, especially since less people are gonna listen to Christmas songs after Dec 25th"
3952,2020-12-30 00:45:57,kmo7u2,"the kanye track would have been a top 5 debut on spotify without christmas songs, i think itll make it"
3953,2020-12-30 00:54:41,kmo7u2,Blinding Lights might come back next week
3954,2020-12-30 01:27:55,kmo7u2,"That's one way to look at it, I fucking hate it."
3955,2020-12-29 23:52:30,kmo7u2,"For the marketing that album got, the first week sale is gonna flop"
3956,2020-12-30 01:18:43,kmo7u2,"Yeah I'm not entirely sure it can beat out taylor swifts album for number 1 anymore tbh, which is sad because if kid cudi was on it that would have been a top 10 hit easily with the album going number 1 even though it was originally big 1.5 years ago, a fan post of the song on youtube uploaded recently as they all get taken down is getting more views than some songs on wlr"
3957,2020-12-30 06:06:56,kmo7u2,2016-2018 i had a gf every christmas! then 2019 and now 2020 i‚Äôve been single. as much as i like a relationship i‚Äôve appreciated my time single. hope you can too man
3958,2020-12-30 05:20:21,kmo7u2,I mean what can they do. AIWFC had 17 million streams in one day on Spotify a couple of days ago. If that‚Äôs not deserving of number 1 I don‚Äôt know what is.
3959,2020-12-30 13:46:01,kmo7u2,it is. charts are counted week ahead
3960,2020-12-30 02:18:19,kmo7u2,Not necessarily. People just associate it with the holidays. A lot of people are definitely just letting Spotify playlists run the music
3961,2020-12-30 03:07:01,kmo7u2,"Nah man, for me it's just a warm cozy vibe to have Christmas music playing when it's cold outside and I'm at work. Perfect background music for this time of year."
3962,2020-12-30 17:55:23,kmo7u2,"It‚Äôs not really a religious thing, christmas is very secularized in America."
3963,2020-12-30 17:12:58,kmo7u2,Christmastime gives many people a feeling that I would say is comparable to nostalgia. Listening to the music helps people get into that feeling. Plus tradition
3964,2020-12-30 07:54:27,kmo7u2,I think Slayer doing better than the kanye song
3965,2020-12-30 06:05:35,kmo7u2,what marketing? it‚Äôs literally almost driven by hype generated by carti fans and blogs. no real singles prior to it. it‚Äôs just carti posting shit
3966,2020-12-30 00:22:46,kmo7u2,Well I mean the album was terrible
3967,2020-12-30 06:11:10,kmo7u2,Yeah I‚Äôm equal parts nervous and excited about my single life. It‚Äôs just the uncertainty that gets to me sometimes although I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be fine. Thanks bro
3968,2020-12-30 02:30:12,kmo7u2,Ah ok makes sense
3969,2020-12-30 16:24:34,kmo7u2,also don't underestimate how many people are using this for their businesses
3970,2020-12-30 20:14:42,kmo7u2,"True shit, can't remember the last time I heard someone regard Christmas celebrations in a religious light"
3971,2020-12-30 09:58:07,kmo7u2,"Yeah, Slay3r has the most streams."
3972,2020-12-30 03:37:48,kmo7u2,"it's good, remove a couple songs and it's a 8/10 at least"
3973,2020-12-30 06:11:48,kmo7u2,no worries man. you got this!
3974,2020-12-31 01:06:28,kmo7u2,like there's basically another holiday on top of it with Santa and presents that even non-Christians practice and tell their kids abt
3975,2020-12-30 04:48:13,kmo7u2,The beginning sucks and nobody is going to listen to the rest of the album if they get a bad first impression.
3976,2020-12-30 04:11:42,kmo7u2,Not even close it‚Äôs a 4 at best lmao
3977,2020-12-30 05:03:05,kmo7u2,"i completely understand but that's why I'm saying this, ppl listened to the first half and turned it off"
3978,2020-12-30 10:08:57,kmo7u2,Best part of the album is beginning and Album is great
3979,2020-12-30 05:03:59,kmo7u2,idk how you can listen to the second half and think most of those songs arent good (assuming youre a carti fan)
3980,2020-12-30 04:57:26,kmo7u2,"As an overall tape yes.

But there's still a few songs that are prime Carti"

3987,2020-12-29 22:51:39,kmherd,Somehow to the Biebers it was inappropriate to have sex before marriage but not inappropriate to be this fucking horny on the TL
3988,2020-12-29 20:21:08,kmherd,Rich guy has sex with his wife. More at 11.
3989,2020-12-30 00:15:33,kmherd,TIL Bieber is married ü§î

3996,2020-12-30 02:47:13,kmherd,I googled who the fuck hailey is and was disappointed to see that Justin Beiber... still looks like that

4012,2020-12-29 22:30:55,kmherd,Ignorant rich guy thinks having sex with his wife is something he should share with the world....or at least his followers. More after these messages.

4023,2021-01-11 01:23:22,kmherd,You‚Äôre all wrong. Dez Fafara frontman for Devildriver and his wife are the worst. I‚Äôve never seen such incessant soppy displays of affection ever
4024,2020-12-29 23:53:13,kmherd,"This was literally one of my friends tho. Posting constantly about how much she loves her boyfriend, making dirty or flirtatious comments and such. Made me hurl. Shes the reason i left facebook. If youre actually in a happy relationship why tf cant you just enjoy it without making it your life online too??"
4025,2020-12-30 14:53:00,kmherd,It‚Äôs usually an indicator of either the honeymoon phase or a cheater. Comfortable people don‚Äôt need to reassure the world that their SO is important to them.

4042,2020-12-30 11:30:56,kmherd,I thought he was making fun of her because she is a thot. I was mistaken.
4043,2020-12-30 21:15:04,kmherd,I thought he was insulting his sister and calling her a slut!
4044,2020-12-30 02:41:08,kmherd,"let‚Äôs go ride a bike, with my wife AHH"
4045,2020-12-29 23:19:46,kmherd,Made a whole album dedicated to marrying his wife and it was complete ass. His (former) manager filed a lawsuit because chance blamed him the poor reception despite the manger saying he needed to put more effort into the album
4046,2020-12-29 23:00:17,kmherd,Did you know he's biracial?
4047,2020-12-30 00:42:18,kmherd,My ex did that shit even after I harshly told her to knock it the fuck off. She couldn't understand that so she became single. These people are the worst.
4048,2020-12-30 14:07:15,kmherd,"Oh god, I have a friend like that on Facebook.  Constantly posts about how Not Like Other Girls she is, how she's super sexually adventurous, and how her marriage is sooo great and quirky and full of sex.  She's fucking 33!"

4050,2020-12-30 09:30:21,kmherd,Is it on Netflix or Amazon prime? Or National Geographic?
4051,2020-12-30 14:12:58,kmherd,Would you?
4052,2020-12-31 18:56:04,kmherd,Rudefully disagree
4053,2020-12-30 09:00:40,kmherd,Or takes quite a lot of acid..
4054,2020-12-30 01:27:02,kmherd,"Or at least that's what they told her parents lol

I'm sure it happens, but I could never imagine marrying someone without sleeping with them before hand...like that shit makes no sense to me"
4055,2020-12-30 09:39:33,kmherd,"It‚Äôs cool to have sex before marriage, as long as it‚Äôs not with the person you‚Äôre courting. The more you know."
4056,2020-12-30 08:00:22,kmherd,Oh man I totally forgot he had his whole little Jesus turn around

Here's hoping it's a lone miss and he returns to form with whatever he puts out next. There are way too many amazing, creative rappers right now to think you can skate by on mediocrity and previous successes."

4073,2020-12-30 04:23:10,kmherd,"I always felt the same way. Then my sister-in-law and her husband waited for marriage. SIL was not a virgin when they met (I'm not positive about him, I think he was), but they knew pretty early on for them it was marriage or bust, so they waited. I feel like for them it was the right choice. They wanted to go into their marriage and feel like it was a different relationship than their dating relationship. If you live together already, you're already sleeping together, then you may not give your marriage the reverence it deserves. You may treat your spouse the same as you have always treated them. 

At least, that was her argument. My husband and I still lived together and had sex before marriage. But I can see her argument."

4079,2020-12-30 01:16:59,kmherd,I don't understand how anyone would enjoy that. I was embarrassed as hell each time and felt like ly privacy was being invaded (since it was). It made me extremely uncomfortable.
4080,2020-12-30 16:25:22,kmherd,"Definitely.  She always post these bait questions for guys to tell her how hot she is, too.  It makes me cringe.  

She *is* extremely beautiful, so it's really unnecessary and weird."
4081,2020-12-30 02:52:50,kmherd,"Sexual skill isn‚Äôt some predetermined stat. If someone in a relationship is stuck with awful sex then they and/or their partner isn‚Äôt communicating enough. 

Like anything you practice, experiment, communicate and get better."
4082,2020-12-30 05:11:23,kmherd,"Your mom told me that, too."
4083,2020-12-30 07:54:19,kmherd,"If you always treat your partner well, there should be no need to act any differently, whether you are dating or the government knows you're in a partnership"
4084,2020-12-30 15:03:49,kmherd,">You may treat your spouse the same as you have always treated them.

This should be a given. Marriage shouldn't change the relationship at all."
4085,2020-12-30 21:12:54,kmherd,So - you would treat your partner BETTER when you get married? I would think you should treat them well ALL THE TIME.

4090,2020-12-30 01:36:33,kmherd,This one time i saw her boyfriend had tagged her in some post with some sexual comic thing about a character full of cum and he had tagged her with a ‚Äúlook babe its you ;)‚Äù and she was like ‚Äúnooo stooop üòÇ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äù and that was the moment i cringed so hard my soul left my body for a second
4091,2020-12-30 03:11:39,kmherd,"Nah. It's not just about skill. It's about compatibility. It's about sex drive, libido, desires, hard no's and kinks."
4092,2020-12-30 06:14:51,kmherd,"Sometimes you can have sex with someone and even though neither of you is doing anything wrong, the sex isn‚Äôt good simply because there is no chemistry."
4093,2020-12-30 08:47:06,kmherd,"Also, can‚Äôt speak from experience, but I‚Äôve heard intimacy plays a part as well. Performance doesn‚Äôt necessarily matter if you‚Äôre in love with them."
4094,2020-12-30 06:48:45,kmherd,Many great tutorials online
4095,2020-12-30 19:04:30,kmherd,"yeah, see, I hooked up with her, and the first time we did it she wanted me to choke her.  I, uh, gingerly complied in order to make her happy, but it was uncomfortable.  

And now, we're happily ma.... uh, hell no!  I stopped seeing her."
4096,2020-12-30 08:00:15,kmherd,"But when i think about it, if your partner is against premarital sex they are most likely to never have had sex before. If you convince them to have to have sex they have no experience so the 1st ""test"" might not be accurate. Might need to have various intercourses just to make sure the tests are accurate ya know ;)"
4097,2020-12-30 11:25:10,kmherd,"Funny, his mom allowed me a free test drive without any purchase."
4098,2020-12-30 16:28:43,kmherd,"But shouldn't it? A marriage is different from just dating someone. Your goals are different. When you argue, you're arguing about different things. You're no longer considering ""is this the person for me? Is this the relationship that I want to be in forever?"" You're pushing towards a better version of each other, but you don't question your commitment anymore. At least you shouldn't. 

When you get married, you should become more open with your spouse. Recognize that you have made an even deeper commitment, and accept them more wholy for who they are, flaws and all."

4102,2020-12-30 06:58:54,kmherd,Yeh sexual chemistry has a major play. You can be really attracted to someone then the sex is blah and you kinda lose interest.
4103,2020-12-30 21:10:42,kmherd,Can you provide links? I'd like to send them to my ex!
4104,2020-12-30 13:00:17,kmherd,"Yeah that‚Äôs how test drives work, guy."
4105,2020-12-30 15:30:04,kmherd,"The only thing you have test drive is your own meat, stop lying."
4106,2020-12-30 16:52:19,kmherd,"No, you should have recognized all those things long before you get married."

4128,2020-12-31 01:10:14,kmgd3a,The girl in the second section of the comic looks like she‚Äôs holding her fifth finger and her thumb to make üëå while saying ‚Äúexquisite‚Äù in an English accent.
4129,2021-01-01 12:22:30,kmgd3a,This must have been from toxic - I grew up with this magazine lol

4135,2020-12-29 11:10:32,kmcfal,"Daily trivia.. worth 5mil.. guess what year Justin Bieber was born.. bet you get it wrong.. because the answer isn't listed here!

2k has cheated you out of daily bonus VC & now trivia VC.. I won't even talk about what year Jason Tatum was drafted (2016 if you ask 2k).

If enough people speak up they might care but as it currently stands..

Want to see how many people got it wrong..

They were the only person left and they got another question right, and then, they asked him another and he got it wrong, then, with no one left, it asked another question. üòê"
