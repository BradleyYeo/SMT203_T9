Stop pretending this a ""capitalist"" thing."
44,2020-02-05 11:48:57,ez5r0l,"I'm tired of this argument, but I'll pitch in.

It is true that 'socialism', as in the term for a economic system, is not just 'big government'. But 'Socialism' with a big 'S' refers to the Socialist movement, and the Socialist movement is absolutely in favour of big government. Bernie Sanders is the standard candidate of choice for genuine socialists, whether they are enthusiastic about him or simply consider him the best of a bad bunch. Only the other day someone commented on this subreddit saying how all of their socialist friends were voting Bernie. Furthermore, you have genuine socialists/communists praising countries like Cuba and Venezuela (when it wasn't a total disaster, of course now it's 'state capitalism'). So sure, big government isn't literally 'socialism' the economic system, but it is supported by socialists by and large, and the failures of big government are on their heads.

Another argument against the 'socialism doesn't mean big government' meme is that you don't get to define terms without looking at the facts of reality. Defining Communism, for example, as a 'stateless, classless society' has no basis in reality - it has never been achieved, it is entirely theoretical, and I have never heard even a remotely plausible explanation of how this is to be achieved. Every attempt at building such a society has lead to a totalitarian nightmare, all of the evidence suggests that the philosophy behind Communism results in dictatorship, not freedom from heirarchy, and yet Communists continue to 'define' Communism in this mystical anarchist way without any basis in reality. So in effect you have three concepts - 'Socialism'/'Communism' the political movements, 'socialism'/'communism' the actual, real-life dictatorships these movements created, and 'socialism'/'communism' the magical perfect fairy land which will definitely come about as long as you vote Bernie Sanders."
45,2020-02-05 18:45:44,ez5r0l,"> In a good chunk of my previous arguments here, critics  keep saying more or less “big government”... 

In their defense, the socialist position for decades has been class struggle, and for basic human needs to be provided 'for free', regardless of scarcity.

Government activities that are operating under those assumptions are Socialist in philosophy, if not in system."
46,2020-02-05 09:52:42,ez5r0l,"Think of it as praxis. The right take literally everything not recommended by the Adam Smith institute and say ""that's socialism"" and then the consequence is that we now have an entire generation who think socialism = anything even remotely reasonable. And this opens a doorway to socialism proper.

I'd just critique your capitalism = neoliberalism argument. Capitalism is the system of private property relations. Neoliberalism is the political doctrine that posits that an activist and interventionist state can be a good thing as long as the interventions are in the support of the market. Although it has much older roots you refer to it particularly relates to the 90s and post 90s rejection by parts of the right of the more lassez faire free market capitalism of the 80s right which rejected all forms of state intervention."

Just people playing the definition game for rhetorical points. Outside of this sub, socialism and capitalism mean ""everything bad in the economy or society"" depending on which side you're coming from.

That being said, I do think that Sanders supporters, similar to naive people on the Right, like to mistake social democracy for actual socialism. I chock this up what I see as Sanders obfuscating his beliefs in recent years (probably to avoid being associated with autocratic regimes), even though I think Sanders is not a social democrat, but an out-and-out communist who does not believe that private property should exist at all.

For the record, the actual definition of both systems isn't complex: Capitalism is an economic system which allows for individual ownership of the means of production. Socialism is an economic system which only allows for universal collective ownership of the means of production."

In other words it is a specific type of capitalism, not capitalism itself.

\>  Normally, they are called libertarian socialists.  

There is no such thing as a libertarian socialist. It is a contradiction in terms. Libertarians are individualists. Socialists are collectivists. Never the twain to meet.

57,2020-02-05 18:25:49,ez5r0l,"Is this about Capitalist's not knowing what Socialism is or about how Capitalists can't deny the relevance of the term Neoliberal? 

Honestly, I think most people aware enough to be on this sub know what Socialism is. The problem is that there are people who don't care and just want to OwN tHe CoMmIeS but also that self-identifying Socialists are a hodgepodge of ideas that don't restrict themselves to their actual definition. 

There is much more as well but the above is why I think so many people come across as not understanding Socialism. On more than one occasion I have debated a ""socialist"", decided to do a longer response as an op or top level comment and been flooded with ""not real socialism"" comments.

As far as ""Neoliberal"" goes it may have started out, decades ago, as an effort to describe a set of policy ideals but was brought back in the modern era as a vague insult. Neoliberal, to the extent it can be defined in any useful way, may be a branch of Capitalism but it is just that; a branch. 

Typically calling someone a Neoliberal just means they happen to have more confidence in the market process than you do, much like a normie calling someone a socialist usually just means that person supports more government intervention than they do."

While I can't speak for everyone this is directed towards, I can say that I *understand* socialism.  I just don't *believe* it.  I see it as a beautiful fantasy for the naive, ignorant, and spiteful.  When I talk about it, I use my own definitions because that is what I see it as.


>Neoliberalism is post-Reagan Economics, It’s not from term that socialists coined. Capitalists themselves named it.

Much in the same way communists named capitalism.  Communism is a reactionary movement, a counter to the established system.  In order to self-define, they had to fabricate an identity for the aspects of modern society they were against.  They were, are, and always will be anti-""our society"". And to be defined by your opposite, is to be nothing at all.

Nearly every socialist state has required a reasonably successful capitalist one to canibalize in order to be.  Generally, the state has profound prosperity for the first 10-20 years, but in reality, that's just a party the raiders throw as they loot the corpse of the capitalist nation.  It all falls apart when they run out of money. Neoliberals are effectively socialists that understand what they are- *parasites*.  They support capitalism because a successful parasite's goal is not to kill its host.


What I believe in a nutshell is that the Pareto Principle can be applied to the general production of wealth.  The idea that in any system around 20% of the population will excel and produce the majority of the resources.   Even with their greater competence, the 20% can't make enough to support the other 80.  So if you count up all the production of the world and measure it against the needs, we would come up negative.  So every system of wealth redistribution is destined for failure, state or no.  It's just a lot easier to attack the corruption of the state when debating communists, so that's what people do.


I do, on the other hand believe that socialism/communism can work but only on the small scale.  It all falls apart when the population of the commune are no longer fully invested in each other.  A classic American nuclear family is effectively a communist dictatorship that works because they love each other.  I could see it working as far as individual companies and towns, *maybe* states.  But you would have to maintain investment of the members, and that gets even harder with size, especially without a central power for the commune.


On the topic of totalitarianism and anarchism, I think both sides have it wrong.  I believe we need laws and a arbitration system for enforcing and maintaining them, I also believe that the punishments for all laws should be brutally increased, but here's the thing: all laws that don't warrant brutal punishment, *shouldn't be laws*.  The central government should be tiny, specialized, and only used to arbitrate in instances where local governments request it.


In short, something I genuinely want to see tried in a system of decentralized government where individual localities can choose their own way a broad spectrum of different systems all glued together with trade.  Where each system is allowed to succeed or fail on their own.  In short, I believe market socialism can work, but all the better if not *all* the localities are socialist.  All systems are tried and given a fair chance, if you don't like your system, you can move to another, freedom is maintained, coersion is eliminated, the free market is in effect. Everyone wins initially, unless they fail on their own merits."
73,2020-02-05 15:22:46,ez5r0l,"The inconsistency of left-anarchism is that all businesses employ the same socialist model, impossible without enforcement. Anyone in the West allowed to employ any socialist model in your business currently, but under socialism hierarchical or private and many other companies would be verboten, so with that increased need for vigilance you'll need a more puissant state than the current.

77,2020-02-05 19:34:00,ez5r0l,"Capitalists generally don't care what socialism is, because their viewpoint is rarely a result of a philosophical thought process.  Socialism asks totally different questions from capitalism, not just arrives at different answers.

A socialist question would be, ""Given that x, y, and z are our ethical principles, what policies should we implement to reflect them?""

A capitalist question would be, ""Given that **I'm going to do** x, y, and z because I feel like it, how can I enable myself to do them and avoid being held personally responsible for the consequences?""

Socialism asks ethical and political questions that are simply not interesting to capitalists.  Asking ""What is right?"" seems (ironically) like a childish topic to a capitalist, who is mainly interested in the practical question of how to game other people for personal advantage.

In other words, capitalism develops highly-evolved tools while being totally indifferent to their application, which results by default in zero-sum applications being the most rewarding to their users.  This is ""neoliberalism"" (a silly term, BTW).  

In capitalism, people who are the most obsessed with money get almost all of it, and through their obsession gain political power to set policies for everyone else.  Thus creating a feedback loop of privilege and destruction that eventually decays into mere feudalism with little economic oxygen.

*Eventually* decayed/feudal societies regrow their rational social structures, but the process is arduous and long, and socialists would just as soon skip the Dark Ages and go straight to the part where people are allowed to be constructive again.

Capitalism is just a rationalization of the impulses of a relative few, emotionally unbalanced individuals who need everything to be a game."

> It is true that 'socialism', as in the term for a economic system, is not just 'big government'. 

Well considering that communists and lib-soc's are mostly anti-statist, yeah.

> But 'Socialism' with a big 'S' refers to the Socialist movement, and the Socialist movement is absolutely in favour of big government. Bernie Sanders is the standard candidate of choice for genuine socialists, whether they are enthusiastic about him or simply consider him the best of a bad bunch. Only the other day someone commented on this subreddit saying how all of their socialist friends were voting Bernie.

While a portion of socialists want ""big-government"", again libertarianism is a critical element here. For example Sanders wants to cut military and author authoritarian spending, which is shrinking the government, so it isn't just that he is needlessly expanding the government or something. Also a critical part of the green new deal is the local governance aspect of it, which again isn't ""big-government"", that is distribution which represents the shrinking of the federal government. Point is, it is a little more complicated than just ""Socialists want a huge government"". I'm a socialist and I don't want a big government, but I still plan on voting for Sanders since he is the closest ideological match. That's how democracy works. 

> Furthermore, you have genuine socialists/communists praising countries like Cuba and Venezuela (when it wasn't a total disaster, of course now it's 'state capitalism'). So sure, big government isn't literally 'socialism' the economic system, but it is supported by socialists by and large, and the failures of big government are on their heads.

Have you stopped to consider that Venezuela isn't acting in the interests of it's workers anymore, and is therefor not really socialist? Once those in power start acting in favor of the oligarchy, it ceased to be socialism, by definition. Instead they are effectively acting like they own the property and using for self enrichment, gee that sounds like capitalism being led by the state! 

>Another argument against the 'socialism doesn't mean big government' meme is that you don't get to define terms without looking at the facts of reality.

While there are some great socialist memes out there, 'socialism doesn't mean big government' is literally fact; Noam Chomsky, Karl Marx, and countless others are against large governments and hierarchical power structures. 

> Defining Communism, for example, as a 'stateless, classless society' has no basis in reality - it has never been achieved, it is entirely theoretical, and I have never heard even a remotely plausible explanation of how this is to be achieved. 

Oh, so you mean like the perfectly free market? It's just a set of ideas that describe an ideal society, of course it hasn't been achieved. 

> Every attempt at building such a society has lead to a totalitarian nightmare, all of the evidence suggests that the philosophy behind Communism results in dictatorship, not freedom from hierarchy, and yet Communists continue to 'define' Communism in this mystical anarchist way without any basis in reality. So in effect you have three concepts - 'Socialism'/'Communism' the political movements, 'socialism'/'communism' the actual, real-life dictatorships these movements created, and 'socialism'/'communism' the magical perfect fairy land which will definitely come about as long as you vote Bernie Sanders.

Ignoring the obvious slippery slope fallacy, the failings of previous socialist countries is a complex and interesting topic that I'd urge you to actually learn about rather than making near baseless assumptions as there are lessons to be learned, but it shows that socialism isn't the issue, it was authoritarianism. Read the communist manifesto at a minimum so that you actually have some idea of what communism is. Also, what Sanders is proposing is more akin to social democracy, not socialism. It is evidence based and we know this stuff works. I'm more concerned with the current tyrant in the Whitehouse who just colluded with the senate to get away with extortion."

“In answer to the Anarchists' claims that they respected the right not to join the collective, Bolloten answers that, ""The fact is that many small holders and tenant farmers were forced to join the collective farms before they had an opportunity to decide freely. Although the libertarian movement tended to minimize the factor of coercion in the development of collectivized agriculture or even to deny it altogether, it was, on occasions, frankly admitted. 'During the first few weeks of the Revolution,' wrote Higinio Noja Ruiz, a prominent member of the CNT, 'the partisans of collectivization acted according to their own revolutionary opinions. They respected neither property nor persons. In some villages collectivization was only possible by imposing it on the minority.'""

Fraser amply confirms Bolloten's allegations. ""There was no need to dragoon them at pistol point: the coercive climate, in which 'fascists' were being shot, was sufficient. 'Spontaneous' and 'forced' collectives existed, as did willing and unwilling collectivists within them."". Fraser goes on to explain that rural collectivization was very different from urban collectivization; while the latter was indeed typically carried out by the workers, the former was not. ""The collectivization, carried out under the general cover, if not necessarily the direct agency, of CNT militia columns, represented a revolutionary minority's attempt to control not only production but consumption for egalitarian purposes and the needs of the war. In this, agrarian collectives differed radically from the industrial collectives which regulated production only.""

214,2020-02-05 16:11:32,ez5r0l,"Although it is amusing, on the flip side, how often times Marxists in particular will fail to understand capitalist price theory too. Their *starting point* is taking the LTV as fundamental fact. It's not a *result* they arrived at somehow through reasoning from fundamentals or, as economists call it, ""micro foundations"". That's honestly a really weird and indefensible chain of reasoning to me.

I often find myself defending the LTV in some aspects against capitalists who misunderstand what it means, what it predicts, and when it applies (unsurprisingly this is extremely common), but I've also found a way to basically reconcile it with normal price theory in a way that seems to me to be unique. I'm surprised no one seems to have bothered trying to do that before. Both sides usually just end up arguing against strawmen. Socialists love to claim the subjective theory of value, as based on the idea of utility-maximizing agents, is ""unscientific"", since utility is unmeasurable -- if that were so, I hope they never need to go see a psychologist, because if they can't tolerate the idea of utility theory I have no idea how they could ever trust psychology and its practitioners. (And since economics is fundamentally a study of how human behaviors interact to produce broader phenomena, isn't some sort of action theory *required* for accurate analysis?) Capitalists love to misapply the LTV by claiming, principally although among many other things, that socialists would assess digging a hole in the ground only to fill it back in again would be worth substantial payment based on the labor expended, when in reality the LTV only actually applies in free, competitive and ideally near-perfect [""perfect"" as used in the academic sense] markets in which the pointless job of hole-digging would not exist anyway."

If you asked a specific question including a subject and a context: i.e ""does socialism encompass social democrats in a modern academic context"", or ""...modern vernacular politics"" or ""...in Marxist-socialist circles"" then we could talk details, but there's never going to be a universal answer for everyone.



So when you see social democrats calling themselves socialists, or the American far-right calling single-payer healthcare socialism, or Marxists disavowing social democrats from the socialist umbrella, it's far more interesting to ask what *values* they're claiming, and what *perception* they're trying to create from doing so. 


* The American far-right calls Social Democracy 'socialism' as a meaningless insult thanks to the legacy of McCarthyism and to muddy the truth of whats being called for, and that's now spread into the mainstream
* Social democrats call themselves socialists because socialism is waaaay more exciting and revolutionary than their moderatism (and we live in a time of radicalisation where social democrats are being squeezed on both sides*) and they were being called it by the far-right *anyway* so may-as-well own it.
*  Marxists fundamentally disagree with social democracy as anything other than a plaster on a gaping wound, fairweather friends at best, and traitors at worst. Much like how Vegans can often be more annoyed by vegetarians than they are by full-blown meat eaters.


It's super interesting when these terms get muddied, because it leads to large shifts in political perception happening very quickly. We now have democratic front-runner Bernie Sanders calling himself a democratic socialist without really being a socialist (in an academic sense) at all, because of these mad radical shifts in vocab.

A capitalist economy could have labor wages that are set by labor with agreements with capitalist private ownership where everyone is satisfied - maybe a situation where the owner of a company gets paid less than most of his workers, but the company and himself are still making a profit.   


All modern economies are some amount of ""mixing"", skewing one way or the other towards a more equal distribution of wealth across the market. Scandinavian countries are still capitalist based market economies. You can still own a business, hire workers, sit back and profit. It's just that your workers have more rights, and you pay more taxes and as a result it's merely harder to attain an unequal amount of wealth without first looking out for your labor.

More importantly: Let's pretend they are completely separate! What's the fucking difference? At the end of the day it's still the same mechanism of control and oppression. 

If you're not a true capitalist, as one whose capital holdings results in their primary form income, as in you don't have to have a job, your capital earns for you...

Lmao, you definitely read nothing. Communism isn't achieved in two days, you genius. Lenin was ""elected"" (because I'm unsure of if he actually controlled anything, or the party in general/whatever) after the civil war to lead the USSR, and some years later installed state capitalism because he thought the process of the transition had to be slower, as Russia wasn't even industrialised. That's why they had to focus on other priorities, because Marx said a prerequisite was to have capitalism and industrialisation was needed to establish capitalism. But since Lenin didn't either like capitalism, he came up with state capitalism, which still worked.

He was unable to achieve communism because a) he died before he could even try go further and b) he didn't focus on trying to achieve it, but to try to industrialise the USSR through state capitalism (with Stalin finishing the process of industrialisation).

\> Is the curriculum of your university the *only* curriculum that can exist, or has someone made decisions about what is and isn't important to know?

No, but you would be surprised at how little variation there is between physics courses. Most unis follows a similar skeleton of Newton > E+M > Thermo >  Relativity > Quantum > Solid State/Particle where they basically learn the same things. A lot of physics is self evidently important to know and there is little discussion of history/politics aside from tidbits about some of the discoveries and experimental techniques they used. Physics is a subject that builds on pre-requisite knowledge which explains the lack of variation between unis. There's stuff we HAVE to learn essentially. There is more variation in 3rd/4th year.

\> Are you not reliant on funding to do your research? Who is giving you that funding and why?

Yes right now I am. It's half government (UK) funded and half funded by an American tech company. The first because the government wants to encourage people to pursue PhDs in science and the latter because it's cheap for a company to pay half of my small wages to do a mini project for them.

\> Who even gets to be on your university course? Are they mostly the children of middle and upper class parents from the ruling ethnic group, with a smattering of incredibly rich students from third-world countries who were raised in isolation from the poverty surrounding them?

Hmm, I would say there are 2-3 people like that on my course out of 12 (hardly from ""ruling"" backgrounds but upper middle class with doctor/academic parents). The rest of us have fairly normal-ish backgrounds. Personally, both my parents are unemployed and I come from a pretty backwards town with a lot of poverty. The thing we have in common is we are mostly just good at physics. In fact being from a poorer town helped me on the way, as I got a summer internship during undergrad specifically for social mobility which would've helped my application massively."

\- Individuals get all their needs met, even if they cannot work through getting the items they need directly (e.g. a wheelchair).

So if I want to grow peaches in a new area I have to make a collective? Which I assume would be the same as capitalism; I.E. I approve to the government/state to make one. 

Would I be worried about being kicked out of the collective I work at if more than 50% of the elected group vote to 'fire' me? Is hiring and firing solely decided by the collective?

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Side note on your rant about CEOs. CEOs aren't there to tell workers HOW to produce as they should know after they are trained (or their skills from other work). They are there to strategise direction what what they are producing and how they are selling it. Even if democratically elected management there would still be a management layer of sorts for this. I think to say ""CEOs regularly take months of vacation time and the industries still operates"" is a big misunderstanding of what management does. For starters if all management on all layers just took months vacation (which is akin closer to all the workers going on strike) the company would no longer be able to adjust to the changes in the market nor would it produce anything new without getting together and making a collective decision....which is the point of upper management. So sure the production still happens but its kind of like a car rolling down hill with no-one at the wheel.

My big issue with a democratically elected management layer for a company is that it is less efficient. It means that workers have to choose managers who will be good at both managing the workers and also making decisions for the company. This is something that workers should take extra time to be aware of otherwise they may find themselves voting against their own interests without even knowing it (or feeling responsible for it). The democratically elected management layer will have to waste time working out what the workers want and pandering to that to make sure they are in for the next election cycle, they will also have to formulate a company strategy that only matters for the length of the cycle. Truly though they have no real interest in growth unless the workers are pushing for growth. All of these things add up to more time wasted and in larger companies are supposed to create the economy of scale that pays for a management layer, so instead of your labour being stolen by greed it is stolen by inefficiency in the pursuit of making everything fair.

An un-changing higher management sector is more efficient than a democratic one, in the same way that a benevolent dictator is the best form of government for getting amazing efficient things done. The issue with capitalism is that people are not benevolent, they are greedy and stupid and instead of having real strategy for growth they exploit the working class to substitute it which is an awful long term strategy. In this sense I find that solutions like CEO pay should be capped at the lowest full time workers pay times X.

Then you weren't talking to very well read libertarians. Slavery is of course possible without a state, it just requires force. Sounds like they were conflating coercion with the state. All coercion is not the state.

>>An ancap believes a society should be built purely on defensive uses of coercion.

The NAP, obviously, which defined aggressive coercion as the first in time to cross a property boundary. This relies on two objective and measurable physical quantities: time and space.

Defensive coercion is coercion used to stop aggressive coercion.

>>Anyone can do it, the owner, his dog, or his agent. None of these are states.

>Oh so if it’s just might makes right, I’ll just sign up with the Crips or the Bloods.

It's not 'might makes right', but once right is established it is backed up by might, assuredly.

Right is established ideally by individual consent, and this is what ancaps propose. We negotiate and make agreements to respect rights mutually among each other, inviting PPR and other norms. A group doing this should have the freedom to choose their norms as long as they aren't hurting others.

You'd be free to live by non-PPR norms with others who want to live that way too. We have to grant everyone the freedom to choose their norms, because the only alternative is someone choosing your norms for you, which is inherently tyrannical.

>>The states exists only because it uses aggressive coercion to defend its monopoly on power.

>And marketizing the capacity to exert violent force is better?

 It is because that creates escapeability, market choice, and this market pressures, pressure specifically to lower costs, increase quality of service, and do so efficiently.

Take the constant friction between the LAPD and certain black-majority areas where they despise the police. It would be far better for these areas to be allowed to choose their open police services rather than having one forced on them by the city at large.

This would repair relations between their police and the citizens there, bringing law and order back to that region. They would also, obviously under such a scene, control their own laws and their chosen police wouldn't be enforcing the stupid laws those people hate, nor could there be any continued perception of being racially-targeted, as they would likely be drawing officers from those same communities.

>>Therefore, you don't need a state to ethically defend your property.

>By that logic. Hell if I can just shoot the person who stole my shit without reprisal, I never have to worry about calling a police officer.

We generally hold that shooting someone for a non-lethal crime is not proportionate and thus unethical. In any city like this where you negotiate laws with others, they are not likely to allow shooting people for literally anything.

Not that you couldn't try it, I'm sure you could find a few dozen people who want to live that way. Only it would kneecap your ability to gain new citizens or visitors, so it would be self-limiting and ultimately die out. Similarly you wouldn't get delivery services or utility companies to agree to do work in such a place.

So you'd essentially be outcasting yourself by adopting stupid laws. Which you'd be free to do, as long as you're not hurting others.

>>That's a better explanation than you deserve.

But even if he did he was espousing the party line of one particular tendency within socialism which I, and many others, would argue isn't really socialist because state ownership is not the same thing as worker control, even if you do have a worker-state (which the USSR claimed to be but wasn't).

If your ethical system is not have then that, you may have more trouble implementing it than we would have (e.g.: if you're going to define employing people as unethical).

Private cities are a function of many individual property owners with contiguous boundaries choosing the same law-set for their property.

So it's a private city, it has decentralized ownership however.

If right is established first and backed up by might, then it's not 'might makes right' which implies using threat of force to get your way, not making agreements with people peacefully and without threats and then enforcing then after the fact.

But I wouldn't expect you to be reflective enough to understand the difference.

All law is backed up by physical force. That doesn't mean all law was *established* by a'might makes right' scenario, nor enshrines that as a legal concept.

>>... the only alternative is someone choosing your norms for you, which is inherently tyrannical...

>I’d much rather be party to a system where my rights and protections aren’t literally commodities to be bought and sold on a marketplace. And in fact all the incentives run the other way.

K, in the scenerio I'm talking about, rights and protections cannot be 'bought and sold' so you must be making assumptions somewhere or missing the full picture. 

Individual choice is the basis of a free society, one cannot sell their individual choice nor buy the individual choice of others.

A society where no one can legally force law on anyone else is the ideal.

Why do you think a lot of people confuse fascists for some kind of socialist, a confusion the Nazis did in purpose with their choice of name. Mussolini, the author of the fascist ideology, said fascism was supposed to be a fusion, a 3rd way between the other extremes.

So no, fascism is not socialism, but it did adopt elements of socialism, both in rhetoric and policy. The Nazis did have an actually socialist block that was removed in the Night of Long Knives after the Nazis had power and didn't need to try to appeal or appease the socialists anymore.

>Socialism isn't ""government control of everything"".

Sure, but back then the mainstream of socialism saw that as the way forward. It was pure Marxism, take over the state and run everything from the center, use the power of the state to create communism, blah blah we all know how that turned out.

The socialists' disenchantment with state power when they realized this strategy had failed is what let to reformist socialism, whereby they reconciled themselves to the existence of the state and gave up any pretense to bring anarchist.

In the same way that the decision to purchase a good is left up to the individual, but you still need someone to purchase from!

If all law is made by contractual agreement, necessarily two people are involved at minimum. You cannot form a contract with yourself. You do not need a law for interacting with yourself.

Law's function is to substitute rules for naked force.

If you are alone on your property, you do not need rules / laws. You only need rules when others come to visit or you visit them.

>You're the person who compared the NAP to physical laws

No that was your sloppy reading. I said two physical quantities *can be measured* to determine who is the aggressor in a situation. I.e.: the first guy to punch the other guy is the aggressor, the one that punches back is defending himself. Or X had money and Y took it without consent, therefore Y is a thief.

This has been how we determine right and wrong for generations. It is the formalization of that rule.

You're the one that tried to act as if I was claiming it was some physical law of the universe and not merely a rubric to help determine ethical action.

>You going to compel me to agree to it? 

Of course not. But if you don't agree, you also won't be allowed onto my property, nor the private city's properties, because everyone in the private city has adopted the same law-set for themselves.

>You can't get people to agree now, despite imminent threat of violence backed by the authority of the State. 

It's easy to get people to agree by votes if you split the group.

Propose any rule to a group, you will develop a group that wants that rule and a group that doesn't. Split the group into two groups along choice-lines and you now have two groups, each of unanimous agreement on that issue. This process can continue as long as you like, always producing unanimous agreement groups by splitting the group along choice-lines.

>You're either incredibly naive, or you're openly fantasizing about human behavior.

Nope, you just had no idea that the above could be done. A lack of imagination perhaps.

>It was about setting laws for myself in your libertarian dystopia in the absence of a State.

Why did you say the 'state does that already' then if you're talking about individual choice, because individual choice is what I was talking about. You do not have it in any modern state system.

>Then contrary to what you just said, rights are commodities that become bought and sold.

No, I'm not talking about buying rights, I'm talking about buying services to protect the rights you freely choose to live by.

>There you go. (That right there is why your system has no hope of working in practice)

You might want to add some more explanation if you want to make sense. Previously you said it was because you thought law and rights were being bought and sold that this system couldn't work, now I say you were mistaken and you just said the same thing over again.

>this is insane.

It's not insane, states within the US already compete for business and workers to move there. So do entire nations.

Just emoting outrage isn't an argument.

>Friends, the neighborhood and society just magically ostracize people not in conformity with your notion of ""respecting first principles?""

No, as I said, if you don't agree to the rules you don't get into the city. You have ostracized and outcast yourself already therefore, and have no opportunity to shoot anyone.

>(Mexico and Syria would like a word with you)

...Because ancaps had anything to do with either place.

>As it stands currently, those legal precepts are currently enforced by backing of the State.

The states itself uses law, police, and courts to back those concepts. It's not literally congressmen in uniforms with guns.

You do not need a state to have law, police, and courts. Therefore you do not need a state to have law and order.

>Good luck getting your legal principles to be respected when laws aren't compulsory and exist on a fully voluntary basis.

Once you agree to the rules, they are just as enforceable as they are now. Have you gone this entire conversation and you still don't understand what's being proposed?

Choice of law is voluntary, once you opt-in, law functions just as it does now.

>There is no impartiality in a court that's driven by profit.

Sorry, we don't recognize your rights. That citizens falls under our legal policy. Same with neighborhoods X, Y and Z.

> There is if that court can only make a profit by being impartial. 

The only way a profiteering court can be impartial is only whenever its in said economic interest to be impartial.

Munn took advantage of the fact that black players were mostly not allowed to play on a lot of other teams, so he was able to recruit great players a lot easier. Once all the other schools stopped fielding ""white-only"" teams, MSU dropped off a bit because we no longer got all of those top players almost by default.

So sure, Munn accomplished a ton, but you have to wonder if he would have been as successful without finding that ""loophole"" of talent during his era. Dantonio did it in an era where he had to compete for recruits nationally and did not have any kind of advantage as far as funnelling top tier players into the program like Munn did.

You could also argue that Munn also did not have ""national powerhouses"" to go up against yearly because Bo & Woody had not yet come along to establish Michigan and Ohio State as the programs that Dantonio had to face.

So, did Munn do a lot? Sure. Does Dantonio *pale* in comparison? I don't think so. I think he's right up there."
491,2020-02-06 02:08:35,ez2abc,"No, he's a baggage boy at London's Heathrow Airport, the busiest airport in Europe."
492,2020-02-05 17:24:17,ez2abc,2006 Northwestern was the largest since MSU was down 38-3.
493,2020-02-05 14:12:38,ez2abc,"Oh shit, you're right. For some reason, I read Duffy but internalized Munn."
494,2020-02-06 21:32:26,ez2abc,"Different situations, sure, but Dantonio's program also took rise when their biggest in-state rival hit the tank, leaving the door open for getting in-state players.  I think that point goes which way and I'm not sure that taking advantage of black players other programs wouldn't take should be credited in the negative department for Munn, but anyway...

I'm not sure you're up to date on the programs in the 40s and 50s.  Michigan and Notre Dame were fighting it out for National Championships during Munn's tenure.  Three of his 9 losses came to teams finishing in the top 2, another to Bear Bryant.  Munn not only played several top programs, he beat a lot of them.  A winning percentage of 77% against ranked teams is top tier.  I just believe that Dantonio even deserved to be in the same conversation with Munn."
495,2020-02-05 17:25:48,ez2abc,God it was that long ago?
496,2020-02-06 18:44:46,ez2abc,"We basically invented 28-3, but we took it a little too far."
497,2020-02-05 02:20:34,ez1qf3," This is the offseason content I come for. Simmons is a no-brainer If Brown is gone. Elliot is great for the 2nd round. If Bryce Hall really falls to the third, I think he’d be a steal. Even coming off of his injury. I don’t think Saahdiq falls quite that far, but again, a steal if he does. I’ll have to watch some film on the other guys, but this is solid. Thanks OP"
498,2020-02-05 05:11:01,ez1qf3,"Gonna just say it, I still think Murray isn't a noticeable dropoff from Simmons as a MLB, and that's not even including the value we'd get from trading back several picks and picking Murray top 12-15.

Edit: Also, you have us drafting 2 LTs, only a year after we drafted 2 other LTs, there's such thing as overloading a position, especially when you've got other OL positions missing starting caliber players."
499,2020-02-05 14:24:53,ez1qf3,"I'm ok to fine with this draft, which means, it won't happen."
500,2020-02-05 14:46:22,ez1qf3,"Ahh yes, a draft where we land all of the positions of need lol. Probably not gonna happen. Still think we can have a pretty solid draft tho."
501,2020-02-05 17:50:19,ez1qf3,"If Brown is gone I'll be thrilled with Simmons.  and Elliot would be a good pick in the 2nd but I'm sure of the value with the 7th pick of the round.  Neville Gallimore and Leki  Fotu are good NTs to consider, but again most say  not  with 2nd round pick.  

Bryce Hall will be fine if we get an OL in the first or second, but we can't wait till the 4th to address it.  Best situation is take the best center here, use him at guard until our center proves he is recovered and able to perform at a high level, or cut him  and replace him now with Biadasz or your favorite from  Ruiz or Cushberry.  I prefer Biadasz pre-combine."
502,2020-02-05 21:37:08,ez1qf3,"Slightly irrelevant but the trades offered for On The Clock are incredibly unrealistic.

I did one a while back and the Seahawks offered me their 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th pick for our 2nd."
503,2020-02-06 17:39:19,ez1qf3,"So a question, say Brown or Okudah aren’t gone at 7 and the lions take simmons who do we go for there. To that same extent say both Brown and Simmons are on the board at 7 or Simmons and Okudah. Just wanna see who we’d pick in those scenarios"
504,2020-02-05 15:04:34,ez1qf3,Unless Okudah slips to us
505,2020-02-05 06:25:49,ez1qf3,Any chance one or both of those LTs could switch to guard?  We definitely need more help on the interior side of the line.
506,2020-02-05 06:01:44,ez1qf3,"Yeah that is a good point about Murray and I really like what I have seen from him.  


And yes, I did overload at Tackle, but it also seems to be a position that we have trouble keeping healthy and consistent. I also don't think we have found the long-term answer at LT."
507,2020-02-05 05:19:48,ez1qf3,"I'm with you. I think best case scenario is to trade back. Taking Simmons at 7 will be a mistake imo because he's just never going to be Luke no matter how good he is and he'll be deemed a bust when he doesn't fill those shoes. Trade back, stock up on picks and I'm also a fan of Murray."
508,2020-02-07 00:21:14,ez1qf3,"I think it is possible for all three of those defensive players to be gone if Tua and Herbert don't end up being taken as early as expected. In that scenario I think we would be best off trading back to mid-first round. We could look at taking somebody like Murray with that pick and then load up on interior D-line talent with the additional pick, which would probably be in the second."
509,2020-02-05 15:38:28,ez1qf3,"I still don’t think we take Okudah over Simmons here. I only like Okudah If Brown and Simmons go to the lions/giants. Put elite corners back there, and without defensive pressure, they’re going to get bullied downfield."
510,2020-02-05 06:11:10,ez1qf3,"The problem is then we have 4 LTs, 0 LGs, .5 center, 1 RG, and 1 RT on the roster following the draft. A heavily unbalanced line depth."
511,2020-02-05 07:08:25,ez1qf3,"Who cares if he’s deemed a bust as long as he performs? No one expects anyone to be Luke, this probably won’t ever happen."
512,2020-02-05 13:03:09,ez1qf3,"Trading back requires two teams. We’re in a spot with all of the QB hungry teams ahead of us, so no one is going to be chomping to trade up with us. We’re in the No Man’s Land of the draft, which means that a trade back isn’t going to happen. 

Also, Simmons isn’t a MLB. A very low percentage of his snaps ever came from ILB, and that’s in a 34. He’s an outside player, so safety, nickel, OLB, and pass rusher."
513,2020-02-07 00:21:17,ez1qf3,"I agree, this does seem possible."
514,2020-02-07 00:56:22,ez1qf3,I’d be surprised if atleast Tua isn’t gone in the top 7
515,2020-02-05 15:39:18,ez1qf3,I think Simmons is being overhyped. This happens all the time in the mock draft community with speed rushers and versatile players.
516,2020-02-05 16:18:47,ez1qf3,"Okudah would help this D a lot more than Simmons. Simmons is a stud, no doubt, but is he better than Luke? With Luke last year our defense was one of the worst, so getting a less talented LB isn’t going to fix anything. If we lose bradberry, Donte is the only CB we have, and was benched last year. Okudah probably won’t fall, but if him or Brown is there. That’s the pick."
517,2020-02-05 21:17:34,ez1qf3,"This, this, 1000x this.

Every time someone projects a tackle to us, I cringe. Tackle simply was not the issue this year, and we've invested massively at the position between Moton, Little, and Daley. We're simply better off drafting basically any position other than Tackle, LT especially."
518,2020-02-05 15:14:17,ez1qf3,"that's kind of my point - no one will and if we take a lb at 7, the expectations are going to be compared to Luke despite how good Simmons might be. not to mention that at 7, I think you build out the lines if you can't trade back."
519,2020-02-05 15:17:09,ez1qf3,"I think it's silly to say it's never going to happen because we don't know how free agency or anything will shake out before the draft but I get your point. I still stand by Simmons not being worthwhile at 7, but that's my opinion and odds are that he's not even there by then too. LB is a big issue with Luke gone and I still think taking one at 7 puts that comparison into people's heads whether or not they fill the same role."
520,2020-02-07 00:23:29,ez1qf3,Your username suggests as much.
521,2020-02-07 03:24:08,ez1qf3,The only way I see that happening is if his injury reports come back questionable.
522,2020-02-05 16:30:53,ez1qf3,"I 100% agree that Simmons won’t make the immediate impact that many people think he will. Luke in his prime struggled severely behind the line. That’s why i would still strongly consider Kinlaw if we could trade back a few spots. If Brown is there we gotta do it. I just don’t know if I could say either Simmons or Okudah would be one of the bigger pieces for us at the moment. But again, D-Line is #1 Priority."
523,2020-02-07 03:24:48,ez1qf3,"Maybe, idk I see Miami taking a risk either way because of him sitting out a year regardless"
524,2020-02-05 17:07:36,ez1qf3,"I also like Kinlaw and think trading back is the right move. Maybe with the raiders, But hurney never leaves with more picks, only less"
525,2020-02-05 17:08:42,ez1qf3,"I don’t really know what the Raiders would offer to be honest. No way they’d trade 12 and 19 to move up to 7, and if I’m not mistaken, they don’t have a 2nd round pick at all."
526,2020-02-05 17:29:14,ez1qf3,Swap picks and a 3rd or future second
527,2020-02-05 17:44:25,ez1qf3,"I guess. Just don’t really think a 3rd is enough, especially with all the pieces we need currently. I wouldn’t want to do it for less than a 1st and 2nd. I’d rather trade with Denver."

4:20 PM: We had a good time, until he told me he is going to tell me something.

4:24 PM: He told me about he heard loud 'hi sisters' moanings near my house. In fact the whole neighbourhood did.

6:24: PM: He said i could stay at his house overnighr.

3:26 AM: I crawled out from under of the bed and screamed 'Thank you!' real loud.

3:29 AM: I took a close look to the creature. It is... James Charles. Homever it's not a problem anymore since he is dead.

3:49 AM: The crowd left the building, i just lyed down next to my friend (he didn't woke up the entire time) because i haven't slept for 3 days and need that sweet, sweet sleep.

Holy shit this took me 44 minutes."

547,2020-02-04 17:46:31,eyt8ij,"> You could argue that the turning point was San Fran's decision not to call timeout to stop the clock before the Chiefs were to punt late in the first half. By calling a timeout, the 49ers would have had at least 1:50 and ~~3~~ 2 timeouts, which is plenty of time to get into field goal range or even score a touchdown.

602,2020-02-03 19:28:04,ey8cmn,"This was an absolutely fascinating case and a pleasure to read.

I MUST compliment the writing you did- it really sets a somber tone and almost reminds me of reading a crime novel haha. Something about ""Indeed, the grave itself, denuded of stone or inscription, moved strangers to such pity that they brought flowers to adorn the barren ground. Forgotten in life, unknown in death, thus might have ended this tale of emptiness and mystery"" really stuck out to me as I was reading. Fantastic job!"
603,2020-02-03 20:51:10,ey8cmn,Very good job. I think this would have made a neat plot for a Golden Age Detective story.
604,2020-02-04 02:41:02,ey8cmn,"It was clearly the Lerwills, or perhaps only Mr. Lerwill, who did this. Quite interesting story and, like others, I must commend your writing skill."
605,2020-02-03 19:58:43,ey8cmn,What a tale! Fabulously written too. I hope you continue to write about cases like this.

612,2020-02-04 09:24:29,ey8cmn,"I think you're right u/mcm0313, the timeline and motives are too obvious for it to be anyone else; Hilary Rougier gives away all his money, Mrs Lerwill stops him from speaking to any outsides and on the night of the death William's car \*happens\* to breakdown (perfect alibi no?).   


The frustrating thing is, whilst fingerprinting had begun in 1901 (and thus the laudunum bottles might have been tested), it appears in this case that none were taken.

616,2020-02-04 12:51:16,ey8cmn,"Hi u/CaptionClosed a very good question indeed!  


There have been attempts to cover aspects of the case, both in the newspapers at the time and very brief write-ups since. But there is a vast array of information in disparate places (Sir Bernard Splibury's autobiography, conflicting newspaper reports etc.) and not in any great deal of depth and certainly not in one place.  


What I've tried to do with this tale, is to draw together all the surviving sources into one narrative and to hopefully trigger discussion around this crime (and thankfully its worked!)"
617,2020-02-03 23:41:08,ey8cmn,"Aha u/Puremisty I imagine Miss Marple need only smell the bottle of Laudanum and she'd know the time of death, who the murderer was and what he had for lunch."
618,2020-02-04 12:56:32,ey8cmn,"Oh bugger, I missed the first question! In terms of involvement i'm not a relative of either of the deceased, but I've set up a group to research the history of institutions (jails, dungeons, hospitals etc.) in the UK, starting with Woking.

This story was a happy segue and one I couldn't not write about. There's a few others in the works around other....colourful characters and crimes within the town's history and hopefully I can share these with the group soon."
619,2020-02-04 21:16:02,ey8cmn, Yep. She would’ve solved the case with greater ease.

623,2020-02-03 14:32:22,ey69h4,I dislike morphe and have never tried anything from them out of principle lol but ngl this palette is kind of testing me.
624,2020-02-03 18:38:25,ey69h4,"I was a little upset that Pony worked with Morphe, but I am almost positive the brand doesn't have the same negative association in Korea as it does here so I can't really knock her for it. And as usual, she looks gorgeous and I really liked the look she did on James."
625,2020-02-03 13:52:09,ey69h4,I really like that he was speaking slowly so she could understand! This was super cute.
626,2020-02-03 15:18:19,ey69h4,I loved the look Pony created on James for sure. I am a huge fan of her soft style

628,2020-02-03 19:31:14,ey69h4,"Morphe reminds me of an MLM a lot of the time.  The people who shill for it are really obnoxious about pushing it, and they'll all be super supportive all over each other's posts while still fighting over the same handful of potential customers."
629,2020-02-16 08:04:52,ey69h4,She's the face of the palette... should use her code lol
630,2020-02-03 16:49:39,ey69h4,"I guess b/c it's not really a ""collab."" Her name isn't anywhere on the packaging and none of the shades are named after her or anything about her. She's just in the promo images."
631,2020-02-03 15:21:57,ey69h4,Swatched it and it brought me back to reality.  Pony is incredibly talented and has an eye for color....but in the end it is still a Morphe palette and the pastels are pure chalk.
632,2020-02-03 19:21:19,ey69h4,"I agree. I'm sure people in Korea would rather go for brands like Etude House or Innisfree for makeup before they even CONSIDER dabbing into Morphe. To her I think she's just trying to get her name out to the international audience hence her collabs with MAC and Colourpop as well. Though I must say I don't think she's getting a lot of attention for her Colourpop and Morphe collabs since it's not her name and I barely see her mentioned. On the other hand, Morphe and Colourpop might be trying to test the water in the Korean market since they're pretty big on beauty and makeup."
633,2020-02-03 19:19:30,ey69h4,"I really don't understand where the morphe hate came from. The palettes may not be for everyone, but they aren't bad at all for the price point. It's on par with other cheaper brands, if not one of the best for the price point. 🤷‍♀️

Edit: if you're going to downvote at least tell me why you apparently hate morphe. 🙄"
634,2020-02-03 19:05:42,ey69h4,i- is that slow for him?? he must talk really fast normally
635,2020-02-04 14:13:54,ey69h4,"omg I didn't know why I had such an opinion on Morphe without trying it but the MLM comparison is spot on! And for me, its like, the more the Morphe minions push the products the less I wanna try them."
636,2020-02-03 16:50:22,ey69h4,I like that approach lol
637,2020-02-03 15:50:05,ey69h4,yikes... was considering purchase but thanks for the heads up!
638,2020-02-03 21:57:02,ey69h4,"From what I heard it’s supposed to be more a sheer wash of color. The shades that are similar to colourpop super shocks are really pretty! I bought it but tbh I’m going to return it, I heard about that “sheer wash” thing after I bought it and that’s just not my... style. I like impactful, I wanted impactful pastels. I had one pastel kinda rainbow look in mind and I had to put down the ABH primer to white out my lids and then the NYX glitter primer on my entire lids just to get the mattes to not completely blend away"
639,2020-02-03 19:17:13,ey69h4,"I didn't have this experience at all. Is it just me? Lol. I think they are a bit sheer but it gives them great buildability, too. I then used them on top of a laydown of nyx milk pencil and it pops like crazy."
640,2020-02-03 19:43:07,ey69h4,"I wouldn't say it's pure chalk, at least not on my light medium skin tone. I have this palette and the dare to create, and IMO this one is way better in terms of quality and blendability. The iridescent shimmers are stunning and photos of the palette don't do them justice. The mattes aren't patchy like the dare to create and they build up beautifully with a bit of patience. I've been looking for months for a perfect rainbow pastel palette and for the price, this is a great option! I've even hit pan on a shade already because I use it daily and I have a billion other palettes"
641,2020-02-03 17:53:40,ey69h4,"I wouldn’t say they’re *pure chalk*, that seems over harsh to me. I have the palette and have been using it regularly pretty much since launch, this being the first morphe product I’ve ever bought because I know they have quality issues.

It’s definitely not particularly great, the pastels do take a fair bit of work, but I’m not annoyed that I bought it. The glitters and iridescents are all nice, and the mattes do get opaque with some patience. They blend fine in my experience.

There’s much better pastel palettes, but for so many colours in one place, especially considering some of the colours are pretty unique, I think it’s worth the price despite the pastels being a little fiddly."
642,2020-02-03 19:34:36,ey69h4,Honestly since I would have to buy it from a reseller for 3 times it's actual price (thx third world) I'm just gonna wait for colourpop to release a 9-pan pastel rainbow dupe of sugarpill and be done with it
643,2020-02-03 23:09:54,ey69h4,It’s isn’t  very pigmented. I’ve had to work to build up some color with it. Those glittery toppers are lovely though!
644,2020-02-03 19:55:49,ey69h4,i think colourpop could definitely do well in sk. i think they could fit into the aesthetic pretty well. morphe..? i don’t think so.
645,2020-02-03 19:37:22,ey69h4,Stephanie Nicole's breakdown of Morphe palettes and how the company later affected her employment is why I personally have no interest in them. I also feel like ColourPop covers the cheap palette/single shadow market for me (thought they're not perfect either.)
646,2020-02-03 19:39:48,ey69h4,"this sub is fond of putting down morphe shadows a fair bit, i've noticed. i know a couple of experienced MUAs in my city who swear by them because they give the best bang for your buck. maybe people complain because they find the shadows chalky and theyre tired of multiples of one colour appearing in a palette?? theyre buildable shadows and easy to work with, imo"
647,2020-02-03 16:47:10,ey69h4,I really want it too ugh. But I don't trust the Morphe quality. I'm sure more pastel palettes will come out this year. And I believe the Sugarpill Fun Size palette is still available on the Sugarpill website. It's kind of similar? I'm thinking about that one
648,2020-02-03 19:21:53,ey69h4,"Same! There is better, but I got it on sale and a discount. So I paid a magical $18. Worth. It seems sheer to me, but I also use elf brushes. They build really well, and press on well too. I found if I lay down some white shadow, or even nyx milk pencil, it works really well and pops vividly. For what I paid.. I love the palette!"
649,2020-02-03 20:49:05,ey69h4,"Oh, I haven't seen anything about that - haven't watched her in forever though. I'll look for it when I'm home and decide for myself. If I don't agree with whatever, I can still take my purchases back to Ulta.

I do really love colourpop, but the lack of stuff in store + this is probably just me, but I hate they took out the no filter foundation from Ulta and slapped in the pretty fresh line. It's hydrating, but not what I want, nor what everyone wants. It's just pushing new product. 😭  I now have to buy online, and I can't do returns if the shade is wrong. It bothers me quite a bit."
650,2020-02-03 20:45:30,ey69h4,"Yeah... Bring on more downvotes, but the makeup mob mentality is just getting old. All it takes is one person to say something, and the sheeple follow. Baaaa. 🤷‍♀️

I guess it just depends on the person. I don't like shadows that slap on immediately and become unblendable. I also don't understand the hate for 'fallout', just dust it off! 😂"
651,2020-02-06 04:42:12,ey69h4,"My friend and I went shopping at their store in LA and we both bought the 35b (this was a whiiiiiile ago). Mine worked really well and I love it. Hers? Not so much. The shadows are super hard and she's had to scrape off a LOT of the color to get any shadow. 

This has happened to us a few times and it just sucks trying to buy anything and know that you've got a 50/50 chance of it either being amazing or utter shit."
652,2020-02-03 17:23:13,ey69h4,"I have Fun Size, it's great quality. It builds very nicely, but you do have to layer the shadow to get good pay off.

The Morphe palette is terrible quality."
653,2020-02-03 17:38:08,ey69h4,"The fun size palette has been calling my name. That shade called 8 bit? I love it so much and I swear almost every time I see a look and I'm like ""omg beautiful"" they used that shade."
654,2020-02-03 19:32:53,ey69h4,"As far as I know seems as a permanent release, it does goes sometimes out of stock, but it just got back in stock recently!"
655,2020-02-03 22:57:05,ey69h4,the palette is really chalky sadly :/
656,2020-02-03 21:59:21,ey69h4,"That's interesting. I like the tinted moisturizer trend going on atm, but I fully anticipated the polarizing opinions that came alongside the trend lmao."
657,2020-02-04 03:28:12,ey69h4,i just blow the fallout away with a hairdryer lol. different strokes for different folks i guess
658,2020-02-03 19:20:16,ey69h4,"Thanks for the mini review!

Everyone has that one person they just fall for head over heels, all the sponsorships tempt them and all the collabs are a mUsT bUy!!!!!! and Pony is that person for me. But I really need to just take a deep breath and cool down from the hype and not waste my money on Morphe! I have her CP and MAC collab and I love those but those two brands are much more consistent! And this money saved can be put towards a future collab she had with a more reputable brand because we all know she's not stopping lmaooo"
659,2020-02-03 23:35:18,ey69h4,"Thanks for the TMO 

The more I think about it, the more I wonder if pastels would even look good on my olive undertones anyways. I STILL can't get the Norvina's lavender to look anything other than a green bruise on me >:C"
660,2020-02-03 22:10:16,ey69h4,"I tried it on my hand, and it felt really.. heavy? idk. I may try it again, but I dont think they had a shade for me in store. I may just have to order online. 

About the morphe stephanie nicole thing - HOLY CRAAAAAPP. I had no idea that there were private labeling, or that that kinda thing even existed. Now I feel real weird about my makeup."
661,2020-02-04 03:30:04,ey69h4,Or I use a big fluffy brush and push it upward to “catch” the fallout.
662,2020-02-03 20:44:41,ey69h4,"She is super talented and awesome, but yeah, no need to buy everything she's associated with.

Pastels are pretty hard to do well anyway. Morphe's formulation is just so dry and chalky."
663,2020-02-03 22:40:20,ey69h4,"For reference: certifeye does it too. Many companies do it, really! I personally don't like private label shadows because you're paying more for quality that isn't as good as other companies that have the same kinda price point (again, colourpop is my go-to for cheap shadow, and then for synthetic brushes, I like bh cosmetics.)

Edit: got certifeye and blushtribe confused. They're sister companies. Blushtribe may use private label shadows too, but I'm not sure about that."
664,2020-02-04 04:50:48,ey69h4,"Haha! I think we all have our methods. We should compile a giant list of fallout technique cleanup. I've seen people do their eyeshadow while baking their face to dust it off easier, too."
665,2020-02-03 22:45:16,ey69h4,"Oh wow! Yeah I think I may be taking the morphe stuff back. :c I just.. don't like that. At all. Do you have a list or a youtuber who goes over this stuff? I've been looking but it doesn't seem like a topic that's widely talked about - surely because it would affect income for influencers, ect."
666,2020-02-03 23:14:50,ey69h4,"No, unfortunately, and you're right.

Lanzadas desde 2002, la mayoría de nosotros las ha visto cuando pequeños (aunque sea al menos una película), por lo que tiene un grado de impacto en una generación. Tuvo buenas acogidas del público además de su excelente producción en efectos especiales (en las primeras dos películas; Spiderman 2 ganó el Oscar a aquella categoría) mientras que la tercera da por cerrar algunos cuestionamientos de la historia (como por ejemplo, el asesino del Tío Ben). Aparte, actualmente se hacen bastantes referencias a algunas escenas de los rodajes (por ejemplo, en memes) además de encasillar a Maguire como el mejor Peter Parker hasta el momento."

This is from an interview he did: Hill said that ""every film I've done has been a Western"", and elaborated in another that ""the Western is ultimately a stripped down moral universe that is, whatever the dramatic problems are, beyond the normal avenues of social control and social alleviation of the problem, and I like to do that even within contemporary stories""."

752,2020-03-17 04:37:02,exw3gj,Awesome! Thank you for all this.
753,2020-02-03 00:22:14,exw3gj,Karen Savage is magical.
754,2020-02-03 00:34:16,exw3gj,I really like Elizabeth Klett. Especially loved her Jane Eyre narration.
755,2020-02-03 05:44:55,exw3gj,"Back when I used to use LibreVox, it seemed like every book was recorded using text-to-speech software, which I found off-putting. I'd settle for a bad human narrator over the best machine narrator any day..."
756,2020-02-04 16:27:40,exw3gj,Karen Savage is the BEST. She also has a great audiobook of The Scarlet Pimpernel.
757,2020-02-03 07:16:01,exw3gj,"I gave you an upvote also, now you can return twice! (I don’t know what I’m doing, I just wanted to be a part of something)."
758,2020-02-03 13:38:19,exw3gj,Saving posts makes it super easy to find them later no matter what device you’re on

Smart and Listen are well received 

You can also try the librivox app"
761,2020-02-03 04:55:40,exw3gj,I’ve listened to Moby Dick a couple times. It’s great.
762,2020-03-21 01:09:48,exw3gj,Stewart Wills does a great job narating  it.

766,2020-03-16 15:35:26,exw3gj,Wow. Thanks!  Sounds so fun.
767,2020-02-03 05:29:25,exw3gj,Your local library probably checks out audiobooks also. I have switched from Audible to the library almost exclusively at this point.
768,2020-02-03 09:38:13,exw3gj,"For audible they often do a cheap audiobook if you buy the kindle version of the book, it isn't a massive saving but it can sometimes be cheaper to buy an on-sale kindle book then add the audible rather than buying an audible credit.    
Obviously the range is limited to stuff that's on offer but I get through a fair amount of audio books and have saved a few quid like this."
769,2020-02-03 06:44:32,exw3gj,It's great for old classics and a few hidden gems (favorite was Diaries of a Uboat Commander).
770,2020-02-03 00:37:08,exw3gj,Your public library would be the best place to download those for free. Those books aren’t going to be in the public domain.

772,2020-02-03 12:51:53,exw3gj,"Exactly. Because everything Librevox produces is released to the public domain. Not only is the text of the books in the public domain, but so are the recordings. That means anyone can copy and distribute these audio books anyway they like."

775,2020-02-03 19:40:22,exw3gj,These are whole books unless the recording notes that it is abridged.

779,2020-02-03 03:23:55,exw3gj,I believe fully that her reading is the definitive audio version of Jane Eyre.
780,2020-02-03 10:47:47,exw3gj,You're in luck!  They have tons of bad human narrators.
781,2020-02-03 08:44:13,exw3gj,I upvoted you. Does that help?
782,2020-02-03 18:20:47,exw3gj,"Awesome, thanks!  Giving Listen a try."
783,2020-02-03 06:43:03,exw3gj,"It's hit or miss. I use Libby and on average the wait for the audiobook I'm looking for is a 10-14 week wait. That's fine for books that aren't part of a series or or something, like professional development. But, when you want something specific and its 3 months on hold, audible is preferred."
784,2020-03-16 12:59:12,exw3gj,"My library is great, but the holds are super long and you only get the book for 7 days. It's fine if you have a set reading schedule, but if you don't start reading it right away you're probably going to run out of time.  Still amazing, though!"
785,2020-02-03 00:38:00,exw3gj,And if my public library doesn’t have them either?
786,2020-02-03 20:01:20,exw3gj,Thank you!

793,2020-02-02 18:25:48,exsgb1,Low key James Charles is actually pretty good at mario kart wii. There are some people that have no idea how to play and absolutely suck when they play that game but he kinda slayed it
794,2020-02-03 05:28:56,exsgb1,Fuck that would be rapist
795,2020-02-02 19:29:16,exsaw7,You don't have to act like anything. Just do you.
796,2020-02-02 18:05:22,exsaw7,"Wear a dress? 

Do you actually want to be more feminine or are you trying to act feminine so people remember you're gay?"
797,2020-02-02 18:18:03,exsaw7,Why?
798,2020-02-02 19:34:11,exsaw7,Please don't
799,2020-02-02 19:48:05,exsaw7,"I’m confused.  Are you thinking you need to present as effeminate to be seen as gay?  Why strive to change your image for the sake of strangers?

Anyone who argues with you about your own sexuality is an idiot.  You don’t need to carry gay receipts to prove yourself to people.

Be yourself.  You don’t need to have chiffon lace flow from your mouth with every word to be “part of the club.”  If you love letting that flag fly, by all means do it, but please don’t think it is a requirement."
800,2020-02-02 20:35:07,exsaw7,"Just act like yourself. People mistake me for being straight. It's isn't the end of the world, just correct them or don't."
801,2020-02-02 18:48:43,exsaw7,"First, dont be afraid to be gay or bi and be masculine

PLENTY OGF GUYS ARE MASC AF WHO ARE GAY/BI

Second, ask yourself, are you trying to present yourself as feminine because you like being feminine? Otr are you just trying to let people know you're not straight?

Because if you are just doing it to show people you are bi/gay, just wear some rainbow shit... Like i habe a rainbow pin on my bag. Or if you're into tattoos I've seen a few of my friends do rainbow tatts or whatever queer symbol that fits them..

Now if you genuinely like just being feminine, why not hangout a lot more with your girl friends? I'm also bi and did a lot of makeovers and stuff with my girl friends. Tight/fit fitting clothing with multiple bright colors work (not monochrome or just jeans and a shirt). Earrings are big go to as well (not the studs tho).

Really just ask yourself why you want to be fem first!
NOTHING WRONG WITH BEING MASCULINE GAY/BI!!"
802,2020-02-02 22:38:32,exsaw7,"I just want to stop the constant arguments over people not believing it. Also want the constant girlfriend questions to stop after telling people I'm not into girls. It makes it seem like to me like I'm being annoying about it or just saying to go get attention 

I don't mind being more Feminine, just don't really know how :/"
803,2020-02-02 18:41:46,exsaw7,Exactly
804,2020-02-02 22:38:07,exsaw7,So I can stop having the constant arguments with people who don't believe I'm gay.
805,2020-02-02 22:48:45,exsaw7,Don't be something you're not just to please others.
806,2020-02-02 22:42:15,exsaw7,That's silly. Be yourself.
807,2020-02-02 22:50:15,exsaw7,"No, it's not silly. Again I have NO issue with being treated like normal, id actually prefer it.

But when almost no one believes me, and people act like nothing happened, I'm I'm STILL getting girlfriend questions that's when the issue starts."
808,2020-02-02 23:37:33,exsaw7,"You would be living their stereotypes and perpetuating caricatures, a disservice to the rest of us who are not like that"

T-Mac was a defensive liability. And if we're not talking about Kobe prior to 2003, 3rd team has no proper defense on the wings. Magic used to defend big SGs or SFs of his opponent team."

870,2020-03-28 13:38:31,fqjzfq,You mean the team with three power forwards and a center?
871,2020-03-28 13:35:31,fqjzfq,"Not really. Team C would be close. Kobe is the closest iteration of MJ you can find. Tim was the greatest PF of all time. Hakeem and Shaq are top 3 centres of all time, can’t go wrong with either choice. Magic gives that team better playmaking than team A."
872,2020-03-28 13:44:15,fqjzfq,"You’re fine with T Mac being a defensive liability. You have Duncan AND Hakeem behind him. 

Magic running the fast break to TMac and Kobe on the wings and Hakeem or Duncan as a trailer is a better fit than Kidd."
873,2020-03-28 14:07:36,fqjzfq,Lmao Kobe was an excellent defender until 2010 at least. Kidd was tall and strong. Third team would lock down MJ
874,2020-03-28 14:13:11,fqjzfq,Yes you are? One day y'all are gonna get enough of giving nash credit for the abilities of others and for acting like Pringles didn't optimize literally every lead guard he had
875,2020-03-28 13:37:44,fqjzfq,"And T Mac was a burner. People forget how potent a scorer he was. 

Upgrade Kidd to Magic/Stockton or Isiah Thomas and C suddenly is far more deadly."
876,2020-03-28 16:58:14,fqjzfq,"Hakeem and Shaq are not top 3 centers of all time.

Russell, Wilt and Kareem are the top 3."
877,2020-03-28 13:47:33,fqjzfq,"Having Duncan and Olajuwon in the paint doesn't mean it's OK to say defense on the wings will be damned.  
    
> Magic running the fast break to TMac and Kobe on the wings

Kidd running the fast break to T-Mac and Kobe on the wings is not much different than this."

879,2020-03-28 14:41:03,fqjzfq,"Im disagreeing with you a lot on saying switching kidd with stockton improves the team. They were both great defenders of course but kidd made more all defensives and all defensive 1st teams, he had much more all-nba first teams and carried his team to the finals twice as the best player. Stockton is higher all time imo because of his insane longevity and durability, and because of his records which wont be broken. But the best year of Jason Kidd and the best year of Johm stockton is probably a debate and switching one for the other wont make any difference"
880,2020-03-28 13:50:38,fqjzfq,He's not going to score easily with Jordon on the perimeter and Malone and Shaq shutting down everything from 15 feet ouh t to the rim though.
881,2020-03-28 13:51:36,fqjzfq,"Magic in the open court versus Kidd in the open court is like Steph vs Seth. 

Yeah they might seem similar but there’s a significant difference"
882,2020-03-28 14:47:45,fqjzfq,"I will bravely say that 17/14.5/2.7 steals is better than 17/11/6 rebounds while shooting almost 12% from the floor higher

Stockton played 1 season more than Kidd did. 

Stockton could have retired after 13 seasons and still hold the assist record. Kidd would have passed him at around game 60 in his 18th year for steals."
883,2020-03-28 13:54:07,fqjzfq,"Malone was better stripping guys trying to post him up. I don’t know that TMac would be trying that and Shaq was notoriously lazy as a defender. 

Jordan would also have to worry about Kobe. 

I still think A wins but it makes C closer. Team B is just rubbish from a putting a team together stand point."
884,2020-03-28 14:00:52,fqjzfq,"This is a statement of someone didn't watch Kidd in his prime on a regular basis.  
  
Kidd is one of top open court generals. Magic is the goat of it. But that certainly was not like Steph vs. Seth. What a joke of an analogy."
885,2020-03-28 16:30:28,fqjzfq,"I didnt just say longevity, i said longevity and durability, the durability is what really makes stockton great, kidd missed a fair amount of games and stockton never did, which raises him all time because the best ability is availability, but it doesnt really mean he was better. 

Also stockton played in an era with more scoring and a faster pace, and oh yeah he had karl malone on his team that kinda helps for getting assists and winning in general.

Stockton wasnt the best player on a team ever throughout his prime, kidd was for several years and brought his team to two finals, then proved himself very capable in a supporting role at an older age and he won a championship with dirk.

Also wait in the year you picked out for kidd, which might not even be his best year, he shot 44%, stockton shot 51% in the year you picked out, how is that amost 12 percentage points higher. And why didnt you give the decimal point for kidds rebounds, which would round them up to 7, or his 2.3 steals. Why didnt you say he was all defensive and all nba first, something stockton never accomplished"
886,2020-03-28 14:05:57,fqjzfq,"I watched Kidd’s whole career. 

He’s very good but Magic is still two tiers higher."
887,2020-03-28 14:08:53,fqjzfq,"LOL. Because Kidd got 12k assists (2nd highest ever) / 9 apg / 4 assist titles career by running set offenses all the time.  
Magic as a player two tiers higher, for sure. As an open court leader? ROFL."
888,2020-03-28 14:09:55,fqjzfq,Magic got 10k on 4 less seasons
889,2020-03-28 05:26:03,fqd1q5,"I think the inner red part of his lip is his actual inner lip lol. If you look at the video the photo corresponds with, he's just wearing like a neutral brown pink type of lipstick. I want to say it looks similar to Charlotte Tilbury's Pillow Talk, but that's only based off online swatches."
890,2020-03-28 06:32:16,fqd1q5,"I went on his Youtube videos and watched a few videos that seemed like it could be the same lip colour cause what better things to do with my time right now. He mentions his favourite liner is colourpops iluvsarah in curvii lip pencil and it seems to match up. Note that the photo is edited it and the colour there is less saturated and darker than the video.

He uses it in this video, albeit for a very short duration you can see it since he fills it in. https://youtu.be/v26nVoCWkH8?t=1373. He seems to use colourpop lip liners a lot. The previous poster is right though that the inner lip is his actual inner lip if you watch the actual video."
891,2020-03-28 07:00:17,fqd1q5,"Oh lol, yea after looking at more of his posts I figured it might be his lip peaking through, but the colour is so pretty in the picture. I’ll definitely look into that lipstick! James honestly has the best picks for nudes that I could see myself wearing. All warm tones which I love. Thanks for the suggestion!"
892,2020-03-28 07:06:03,fqd1q5,Thanks so much for taking your time to watch his videos! Hopefully I can place an order with colourpop when their fulfillment centre is up and running. Also I have come to realize it’s his inner lip and the saturation in the photo. Thanks so much again!
893,2020-03-28 13:01:02,fqcyzg,I would say something like JS Leo and in the middle dabbed some red lipstick like Mac Lady danger?
894,2020-03-28 16:18:35,fqcyzg,"Oh okay, thank you! Happy cake day as well :)"

932,2020-03-28 00:20:12,fq87sx,Good list except I don't think Kawhi is breaking the top 25 at this point in his career.
933,2020-03-27 23:37:50,fq87sx,You should feel embarrassed for putting Kawhi on there.  He's basically had four seasons as an elite player
934,2020-03-27 23:22:56,fq87sx,Shaq at 9 no sir
935,2020-03-27 23:17:33,fq87sx,No luka ? Lol can’t take this list seriously
936,2020-03-28 05:26:06,fq87sx,How is a Celtics fan gonna have Kobe and Magic over Bird?
937,2020-03-27 23:16:57,fq87sx,This is actually a pretty fair list. Only thing I disagree with is KD being a little too high and Kawhi too. 4-7 is all really close to each other so I could see those 3 in any order
938,2020-03-28 06:18:51,fq87sx,Can someone PLEASE explain to me the Kobe over Shaq argument. Never agreed with it. Also Steph over KD?
939,2020-03-27 23:27:42,fq87sx,Kobe’s too high.
940,2020-03-28 00:14:33,fq87sx,"I’d say Dirk over Dwayne, he has an MVP"
941,2020-03-27 23:18:38,fq87sx,if it don't got KJ McDaniels I can't acknowledge it
942,2020-03-27 23:20:12,fq87sx,How much are you weighing legacy enhancers like championships in terms of how “great” they are. Or is this just based purely on how valuable you think they were
943,2020-03-27 23:20:57,fq87sx,No Jamal Murray? Pathetic list
944,2020-03-28 03:58:38,fq87sx,Dr. J should be ahead of Karl Malone and KD. KD should be behind Dirk and Wade. Duncan should be ahead of Kobe
945,2020-03-28 07:56:18,fq87sx,"Durant>curry tbh
Edit: in terms of skill not legacy atm"
946,2020-03-27 23:15:09,fq87sx,Great list minus Kyle Lowry not being *top 3
947,2020-03-27 23:28:08,fq87sx,"Honestly, if you swapped Kobe and Shaq itd be a damn good list. But Shaq at 9 is pretty egregious. There's no argument for Kobe over Shaq.

Edit: I'll put my list

1a) Michael Jordan

1b) Lebron James

3) Kareem Abdul-Jabbar

4) Shaq

5) Magic

6) Larry Bird

7) Tim Duncan

8) Kobe

9) Bill Russell

10) Wilt Chamberlain

11) Hakeem Olajuwon 

12) Stephen Curry

13) Kevin Durant

14) Oscar Robertson

15) Karl Malone

16) David Robinson

17) Moses Malone

18) Kevin Garnett

19) Dwyane Wade

20) Dirk Nowitzki

21) Jerry West

22) Charles Barkley

23) Julius Erving

24) Elgin Baylor

25) Kawhi Leonard"
948,2020-03-28 00:27:06,fq87sx,"Kobe is a little too high, but yeah that’s a pretty good list."
949,2020-03-27 23:16:57,fq87sx,Where are Dion Waiters and Brian Scalabrine?
950,2020-03-27 23:30:04,fq87sx,Malone over Muscala? One *does* deliver on sundays
951,2020-03-27 23:31:04,fq87sx,I'd put Bird higher
952,2020-03-28 00:44:07,fq87sx,Kobe over bird is a sin to me and I’m a Lakers fan
953,2020-03-27 23:51:14,fq87sx,Duncan & Shaq both higher than Kobe period.  LeBron not a lock for the 2 spot for me.  Another Finals MVP for LeBron seals the 2 spot for him as he would be the only person aside from MJ with more than 3
954,2020-03-28 06:50:29,fq87sx,"Great list, but I’d probably put a guy like Havlicek/Maravich over Kawhi"
955,2020-03-28 08:16:33,fq87sx,"I will have:  
K. Malone -> KD -> Dirk -> Barkley -> KG -> Wade"
956,2020-03-28 09:04:54,fq87sx,Can y’all stop putting Curry above KD ...
957,2020-03-28 11:41:36,fq87sx,No bernard king?
958,2020-03-28 12:29:22,fq87sx,"Why is Kobe above: Bird/ Dunkin/ Shaq/ Wilt / Bill Russel?? 

You can argue Hakeem .. maybe?

Also throw some respect on Dr. J and move him up"
959,2020-03-29 15:06:15,fq87sx,"It is one of the best 25 all time lists I have seen so far. 
I personally would not put Kobe that high, and the most debatable choice is Kawhi in that list over  someone like Scottie Pippen or Isiah Thomas"
960,2020-04-11 20:13:17,fq87sx,"My biggest problem with this list is having Steph Curry over Durant. I don’t understand it because they played on the same team and are in the same era. Durant has much better offensive stats. 27-7-7 vs Steph 24-6-5. KD is also more efficient and a better defender. His length and quickness allows him to be a good shot blocker and solid on ball defender who can guard 2-4s. Steph is small and not very strong. He’s not a bad defender because he gives great effort and creates steals, but can never have the defensive impact KD has because of his body. KD also won both Finals MVPs with the Warriors clearly playing better than Steph in the 2017 and 2018 Finals. Steph benefited by having great unselfish teammates who played their role very well. Westbrook often shot the Thunder out of the game when KD was still with the Thunder, and KD had to suffer with a bad coach (starting Perkins in the 2012 Finals) and bad organization that made an unforgivable trade in getting rid of Harden. I’m interested to hear a Steph argument, because this one isn’t even close to me."
961,2020-03-27 23:40:56,fq87sx,"Swap Kobe and Shaq, Kobe is a touch too high and Shaq is a bit too low. Barkley is too low, he was insane. Kawhi isn’t top 25 yet."
962,2020-03-28 07:08:19,fq87sx,Kareem #1 don’t @ me
963,2020-03-28 11:40:50,fq87sx,Jordans on the top. Thats all i came to check. Lol.
964,2020-03-27 23:14:58,fq87sx,Wilt and wade need to be higher
965,2020-03-28 00:44:47,fq87sx,Bird over magic and kobe
966,2020-03-28 07:55:29,fq87sx,LeBron over Jordan.
967,2020-03-28 00:20:45,fq87sx,Good list bro but that Hakeem ranking is ridiculous. He is top 5. Wilt is not better than Hakeem. They literally won the same amount of rings except wilt played in a 8 team league and half the league was 6'1 white boys. I also would say Curry be further back. I would also say Shaq ahead of Bill Russell and Tim Duncan at least. Those are just my opinions. But other than that solid list.
968,2020-03-28 00:09:35,fq87sx,"Would swap Magic/Kobe/Bird with Russell/Shaq/Duncan
KD and Curry probably about 3 to 5 spots to high 
Kawhi not top25 yet great peak but severely lack longevity
Dr J too low.
Pretty good list"
969,2020-03-27 23:23:38,fq87sx,Barkley ahead of Karl Malone
970,2020-03-28 04:39:02,fq87sx,"Honestly a really solid list I would just have Tim Duncan over Kobe just because he has more Championships won as the first option and won more MVPs. And I would have KD over Curry for now just because he has been playing at an Elite level for longer so he has more accolades in terms of all nba teams, scoring titles, career numbers etc. I definitely think its debatable tho especially since curry probably has more years left at a high level compared to KD because of the injury."
971,2020-03-27 23:54:14,fq87sx,Kareem above lebron kawhi higher and where is luka
972,2020-03-27 23:15:32,fq87sx,Lebron is significantly better than Jordan but after that its a pretty good list
973,2020-03-28 00:45:42,fq87sx,"Same, top 50 100% right now but not top 25. Another chip would cement top 25."
974,2020-03-28 00:23:14,fq87sx,"And 2 rings, 2 FMVPS, one of the best defenders ever. Kawhi is where he needs to be."
975,2020-03-28 00:20:47,fq87sx,"Shaq was better than Russell, that’s my take"
976,2020-03-28 08:55:41,fq87sx,"Magic was better than Bird 

But i agree on Kobe"
977,2020-03-27 23:20:26,fq87sx,"Yeah seriously, this is probably up there with the best list i've ever seen. KD kawai and steph are probably a little too high but besides that."
978,2020-03-27 23:30:19,fq87sx,But Steph is top 15? Makes no sense
979,2020-03-28 00:44:45,fq87sx,[deleted]
980,2020-03-28 17:46:57,fq87sx,Not even a debate really.
981,2020-03-28 04:31:40,fq87sx,He’s aHEAD of the pack
982,2020-03-28 09:05:23,fq87sx,"In terms of both. 

And it shouldn’t be close, I don’t get why these lists have him above."
983,2020-03-28 01:02:11,fq87sx,Curry over Durant?
984,2020-03-28 07:54:46,fq87sx,LeBron over Jordan.
985,2020-03-28 03:35:08,fq87sx,"Respect for Moses, I love it."

987,2020-03-28 06:58:50,fq87sx,And kobe over shaq for that matter

990,2020-03-28 00:55:37,fq87sx,"> He is top 5

MJ, Kareem, Lebron, Magic, Bird, Shaq, Duncan (not even gonna mention Kobe)... who do you have him over? Honestly asking. You're really giving peak a strong consideration here, right?"
991,2020-03-27 23:30:43,fq87sx,Lmfao
992,2020-03-28 00:22:36,fq87sx,"significantly is a horrible word to use. I consider double the rings more ""significant."" They are pretty close though"
993,2020-03-28 07:05:47,fq87sx,Another chip and FMVP has him top 10. That would make him the only player on NBA history to have 3 fmvp with 3 different teams. The list of players with 3 fmvp is very small.
994,2020-03-28 00:34:45,fq87sx,Yea people clowning Kawhi like he some time of scrub if either him or Kevin win another ring they’re arguably 10 imo
995,2020-03-28 04:33:46,fq87sx,11 time champion and a defensive anchor. Even shaq says russell is the greatest big man of all time
996,2020-03-27 23:43:37,fq87sx,"Steph’s, at worst, the 2nd best PG all time, he’s exactly where he belongs"
997,2020-03-28 01:36:32,fq87sx,"I think it’s fair. He literally changed the game, undisputed mvp, 3 rings, best shooter of all time. Who should be above him that’s not?"
998,2020-03-28 02:21:37,fq87sx,Too soon man... Too soon
999,2020-03-28 04:32:01,fq87sx,Way on **top**
1000,2020-03-28 13:13:04,fq87sx,"In terms of legacy I would say steph has KD beat.

3 chips > 2 which KD had to join steph to get

2 MVPs (1 unanimous) > 1

Steph also has the title of best shooter of all time and was the largest factor in the game fundamentally changing to what it is today."
1001,2020-03-28 00:29:32,fq87sx,"His first finals MVP he averaged 13ppg for that season, Timmy was still leading that team. Kawhi was IMO the best player of that series and did deserve that finale mvp. He doesn’t have any regular season MVP and he’s only been really elite as an all around player for a few seasons. It took a good while for him to peak. He’s still young enough to get higher in the all time ranking, but right now I think he’s Top 30 and maybe 25th but I wouldn’t put him there. Like I said there’s plenty of time, but 4 seasons of elite play isn’t enough to me to say that if his career ended today he’d be the 25th best player in history."
1002,2020-03-28 12:52:39,fq87sx,Wilt def higher than Bill Russel. I think he should be around #7
1003,2020-03-28 02:20:42,fq87sx,MJ Kareem Lebron Magic is all I put above him in no order
1004,2020-03-28 00:30:42,fq87sx,Jordan played against plumbers and dry wallers the competition isnt even close Jordans bulls would of gotten embarassed by the warriors.

1006,2020-03-28 05:43:46,fq87sx,6’9 defensive anchor. He benefitted a ton from the era he played in
1007,2020-03-28 00:53:26,fq87sx,"> the 2nd best PG all time,

Am i misunderstading you or is this a terrible argument for all time list? Seems hollow given that you could be the 5th greatest center of all time if somehow the 4 best players ever were centers too (this is why, for example, Ewing tends to be underrated or underdiscussed)"
1008,2020-03-28 02:45:02,fq87sx,KD for sure. And I’d probably put Moses above him too for the time being
1009,2020-03-28 06:03:36,fq87sx,This list is just down right sloppy without him
1010,2020-03-28 15:19:01,fq87sx,"Steph has zero Finals MVP. No matter what, KD has two. 

Steph also made his first All NBA Team when KD has 4 scoring titles. 

He shouldn’t be ranked above KD all time."
1011,2020-03-28 01:48:03,fq87sx,"I agree with the first FMVP but u lost me on the MVP argument. If u look at a guy like Dwayne Wade who has no regular season MVPs but it still a top 20 player there is no reason why that should disqualify him. What really puts him in the top 25 for me is the back to back DPOY as a perimeter player. MJ didn’t do that, LeBron didn’t do that(or come close), Kobe didn’t do that. That is an insane accomplishment when u take into account that he was also the main offense force on those teams. I understand that he hasn’t really proven his status against a LeBron or KD(or Curry on a healthy team) but he is definitely at top 5 2-way player of all time and that has to count for something. When looking at defense alone he is a top 5 player(when compared to the other guys on this list)."
1012,2020-03-28 05:09:05,fq87sx,Why no Bird and Shaq if you don't mind me asking? If you have them sort of paralelish i can understand but lower...

1016,2020-03-28 01:59:09,fq87sx,"Kawhi isn't a top 5 two way player of all time, that's a massive statement that discounts a ton of all time greats who were elite offensively and defensively for a lot longer than he has been. He's had 4 elite seasons, he came into the league as a great defender. To describe his 2 DPOY as though he was at his offensive prime at the time is also entirely untrue, he lead the team in scoring those seasons by a THIN margin but one of those seasons he didn't break 20ppg. Also just so you're aware, Kawhi isn't the first perimeter player to do that, Montcrief went back to back as DPOY as a guard. Kawhi has had a VERY strong peak, and if we rank players on peak alone he'd be higher, but longevity and sustained dominance is a factor and he has not shown that. Also as far as Dwade goes he has more rings, was a top (and arguably top 5) player in the league for MUCH longer than Kawhi has been. He's considered by many to be top 3 at his position for a reason."
1017,2020-03-28 13:29:58,fq87sx,They are near close but Hakeem was a beast man. I normally have have Bird a little lower than usual. And Shaq would follow. I would understand Magic Bird Hakeem and Shaq all getting mixed around too. If Hakeem was ranked 7 I would respect that too. I just don’t like seeing Duncan Russell or Wilt above him.
1018,2020-03-28 02:34:01,fq87sx,Lol what do you think the spurs or the warriors would do to the teams that jordan played in the finals
1019,2020-03-28 02:24:40,fq87sx,U make some very good points. All I’m trying to say is that winning 2 consecutive DPOY as a perimeter player while also being a top 5 offensive player(compared to his peers) is insane. If u look at the other guys that have more than 1 DPOY awards they are all defensive specialist(except Hakeem) but he can also carry a team offensively and that why I think he is so special. I do agree that he has to keep up this level of play but I see no reason why he can’t.
1020,2020-03-28 02:35:22,fq87sx,"You're grossly discrediting those Bulls teams. Even if you believe that Lebron is 1 and Jordan is 2, this is just a terrible take"
1021,2020-03-28 02:26:51,fq87sx,"Kawhi never won a DPOY as a top 5 offensive player, so that's not really an argument. He barely broke 21ppg in his second DPOY campaign and frankly hasn't shown the same level of defense that he had pre-injury now that he's been at his offensive peak even though he's still been an excellent defender."
1022,2020-03-28 02:36:57,fq87sx,"I agree with everything u said but we are looking at a player as a whole. What have they accomplished throughout their career? Idk, I just think that he gets on the list more for his defense than his offense."
1023,2020-03-28 02:44:31,fq87sx,"There have been a lot of great defenders. He's one of the best perimeter D guys in history. There have also been several better overall defenders than Kawhi, even if they don't top his perimeter D. Someone like Pippen even has a strong argument over Kawhi. Elite defender, key piece in 6 championship runs, top 10 player in the league at his prime and he sustained that level of play over more seasons than Kawhi has thus far. I'm not saying I'm putting Scottie over Klaw, but there's a very easy argument to be made for it. There have been a lot of all time great players, and I think that Kawhi having a really fantastic peak doesn't do enough to put him in the top 25, even if he is near it. You said yourself, look at the player as a whole and what they've accomplished throughout their career. Kawhi was never a top 5 offensive player when winning DPOY, and Kawhi has only had 4 seasons of overall elite play. Normally I think theres a tendency to underrate modern players as a result of glorifying players from past eras, in this case we're giving Kawhi a lot of credit for having a very dominant peak while neglecting that there have been many players in league history who have been top 5 in the league at one time or another. Kawhi hasn't done it for very long. Give him time to get there, he'll almost certainly end higher than 25 or even in the top 15-20"
1024,2020-03-28 02:49:07,fq87sx,"That what I’m saying though, guys like Scottie have been “comparable” to his DPOY years but his performance last year gives him the edge over all of them. Elite defensive players like Scottie, Rodman, Dwight, Ben Wallace etc are all defensive beasts like him but none of them can play the other side of the ball like him. I do agree that we should probably give it more time but his last 4 years have been comparable to 4 years stretches of the guys around him."
1025,2020-03-28 02:53:59,fq87sx,"Yeah if his career ended today he’d have 4 elite years. And Kawhi in his current state is not comparable to his DPOY years, you can’t mesh those together. He never won DPOY as a top offensive player. Kawhi has had a VERY high peak, he has had no longevity. If we rank everyone by their best 4 seasons it would be a different story, but you can’t preach ranking based on the player as a whole and what they’ve accomplished over their entire career and not consider that Kawhi has had very few seasons as a top 10+ player in the league."

Nexus was fun. Tone was very techno thriller, definitely some interesting “ideas sci-fi” in there but for me anyway, the action-adventure tone dominated, which is not a bad thing but it was a bit different to what I expected. It was compared (favourably) to Crichton, which I think is apt. Also felt similar to Suarez for me but not quite as slick."

1063,2020-03-27 21:58:28,fpsh5c,"Yeah, it leans more fantasy, but it was nominated for both the Hugo award and Nebula award, and it’s tagged in Goodreads as steampunk science fiction in addition to fantasy.

1066,2020-03-27 12:51:30,fpsh5c,">The Three-Body Problem

Finally getting around to reading this. Will get to it after work today."
1067,2020-03-27 23:13:40,fpsh5c,Wow thats very interesting! I should check it out
1068,2020-03-27 15:46:05,fpsh5c,"Each book got significantly better, IMO.

A lot of people think the second book is the best of the series, but I love the third book most of all.

You should absolutely continue on with the series."
1069,2020-03-27 17:07:03,fpsh5c,"Lots of good fun ideas so it's definitely a ""got my money's worth and some more"" book and imo the plot is very good and very interesting. But I found the writing cold and never really ended up caring about the world in the story. So I did not read the next ones but was glad I read the first one."
1070,2020-03-27 17:30:39,fpsh5c,"I had struggles with each book (2 the most, then 3, then 1), but ultimately I'm glad I stuck with the series and got to experience it all the way through."
1071,2020-03-27 17:02:47,fpsh5c,"The way it was described to me is that generally the more affinity you have for STEM fields, the more you like the series, and the better it gets. (Partially because the theme is ""engineers save humanity"".)

But if you struggled with the first book, it will probably get worse if you continue with the series.

Personally I thought Three-Body Problem was ok, but didn't deserve the raves it got, and so didn't continue with the series. I'm ok with my decision. I'd much rather read something by N.K. Jemisin or China Mieville or Peter Watts, and Watts' short novel ""Blindsight"" is broadly similar to 3BP."
1072,2020-03-27 18:54:51,fpsh5c,The first book has a lot of boring forest BS. Overall I still give it 4.8/5.
1073,2020-03-27 18:00:36,fpsh5c,I'll try it  - thanks!
1074,2020-03-27 17:40:11,fpsh5c,"The second book is way better than the first, and the third is the best one of the series."
1075,2020-03-27 17:41:16,fpsh5c,"Man, I have to vehemently disagree — Blindsight is nowhere near as good as TBP and it’s sequels."
1076,2020-03-27 20:46:17,fpsh5c,"Yeah, the first book is tedious at times, but it’s basically just laying the foundation for the crazy-expansive scope the rest of the series explores."
1077,2020-03-27 17:54:09,fpsh5c,"Maybe but that is subjective: I tend to read a writer and know if I want to read more of their work or else the alternative option is the many more different writers I've never read or discovered who are worth reading. So if the writer does not ""blow me away"" then I generally take the latter option given the sheer numbers to get through!

Thanks for compiling the list: I skimmed over every book with little info on how to identify ones that might appeal to me, but using some various different thinking approaches I found:

* Martha Wells
* Ted Chinag
* China Melvielle
* some one else who I've already forgotten which is annoying!

Again many thanks, also your own best and looking forward, match some of mine."
1078,2020-03-27 20:00:03,fpsh5c,"To each their own. I've already described my reaction to 3BP, while Blindsight grabbed me from the start and didn't let me go until the end – and left me wanting more. I read it on a monitor, I think in one sitting in fact, and it's the only novel I've read that way to this day. It also caused me to look up some of Thomas Metzinger's work, which I thoroughly enjoyed reading.

It was too bad Echopraxia wasn't as strong, though it's still a very worthwhile read."
1079,2020-03-28 01:47:05,fpsh5c,I understood the need for the forest parts and I can see how others would see it as lengthy.  I just kept reading so I could get back to the 3 body system story and the people who kept seeing 'the clock'.
1080,2020-03-27 18:01:57,fpsh5c,"Yeah, it’s definitely subjective. However, I have found that for most authors I can love one of their books and yet absolutely despise other books of theirs. Except Vonnegut, that man never wrote a bad thing in his life IMO.

I’ve said this before on Reddit but honestly, when I’ve been backpacking/travelling around the world for long periods of time I often started to really miss some nice physical contact. I would end up hooking up with people just to be able to spoon with someone and waking up next to them.  
It’s such a wonderful feeling. 

If I’d go “Heeey, wanna head to my room/your room/place to spoon, cuddle and sleep?” I’d get some weird looks and people assuming that I’d be trying to get in their pants in a weird roundabout and possibly creepy way.  

But goddamn, sometimes you just want to hold someone/be held by someone and have that physical contact, sans sex."

You still the bomb though"
1288,2020-03-27 03:23:47,fpnhhu,"Wait what? This sounded like a Sheff G song for some reason...

Edit: Okay, I'm dumb. Wdh, I've been listening to Sheff G on Spotify for a few years, it's today that I found out that voice actually belongs to another rapper called Sleepy Hollow lol."
1289,2020-03-27 06:47:54,fpnhhu,do you know what song the female vocals are from?

1313,2020-03-27 11:58:29,fpnhhu,How do people like you live with being so unremarkably average that you type this into your computer and click post?
1314,2020-03-27 05:25:55,fpnhhu,I dunno man. I like dudes and my dick goes concave at the thought of JC. I'd need a couple hundred tbh.
1315,2020-03-27 08:15:13,fpnhhu,I wish reddit would stop calling every asshole homophobe gay. I know it’s more because people love hypocrisy and less meant as an insult but it seems like a really fine line sometimes
1316,2020-03-27 08:00:38,fpnhhu,To be attracted to James Charles you need to Mannequin sexual.

1333,2020-03-27 04:59:21,fpnhhu,"The joke is that he clearly goes ""no way"" but then crawls back to ""yes"" at the end. It's a more complicated version of ""i'm not gay but $20 is $20"" or something like that?"
1334,2020-07-30 03:15:15,fpnhhu,"i'll allow it.

I am the 44th President of the United States, Obama."

1338,2020-03-27 17:01:14,fpnhhu,Welcome to the lifetime social distancing crew
1339,2020-03-27 15:53:52,fpnhhu,obviously privileged problems but I'm very dependent on physical affection usually
1340,2020-03-27 15:52:59,fpnhhu,Yeah I have like (at least) a month left and knowing I won't be able to see my bf or very close friends until then is what's getting me
1341,2020-03-27 05:38:23,fpnhhu,i don't like him either but man i really wanna play animal crossing..
1342,2020-03-27 06:18:51,fpnhhu,"I like dudes and I’d cuddle and kiss james Charles. He’s not very sexual though, and I’m generally attracted to jacked and hairy-chested Gaston types, so he doesn’t arouse me much, but I think he’s cute. And unbelievably successful in a role he created for himself."
1343,2020-03-27 04:48:00,fpnhhu,Thank you for your applause
1344,2020-03-27 06:05:24,fpnhhu,wHo HuRT yoU???

1352,2020-03-27 06:20:43,fpnhhu,He did 👇
1353,2020-03-27 16:50:53,fpnhhu,"how would one pronounce that, just outta curiosity?"
1354,2020-03-27 06:31:13,fpnhhu,🗿
1355,2020-03-27 16:52:12,fpnhhu,"“Hinn-sect-oab” is how I envision it, but of course the word was just made by us so any pronunciation works."

1357,2020-03-27 00:18:09,fplqg0,"Personally, that kind of intense full-faced stuff is what initially made me think that femininity wasn't for me. I've come to understand myself a bit better now but I still avoid stuff that loud. I just want to be cute, I don't need everyone around me to notice."
1358,2020-03-26 23:15:42,fplqg0,I would if i could. 🙁
1359,2020-03-26 23:56:49,fplqg0,Bro i wish. I dont know the first thing about makeup
1360,2020-03-26 23:10:13,fplqg0,👋
1361,2020-03-27 03:19:35,fplqg0,"I've been into uni and town a few times with a full face on and it's been fine. Friends are hella supportive and love it when they see it. However don't have the stereotypical 'gay' voice like Charles, so I can't comment on that aspect, I don't act very feminine either. I try to keep myself as In the middle of the spectrum as I can in terms of acting and presenting myself."
1362,2020-03-27 04:37:58,fplqg0,"I'm honestly really scared of looking like him, so I try to avoid the really heavy, caked on look. Not for me"
1363,2020-03-27 01:42:40,fplqg0,"I definitely respect what he does, but that kind of life isn’t for me. I like a more subdued and softer way of presenting as feminine, if that makes sense."
1364,2020-03-27 16:09:58,fplqg0,"For me, kinda? What I mean is that 95% of my wardrobe is ""women's clothes"" and I wear makeup but my style is nothing like his at all with that whole intense Instagram looking makeup (not my thing). But yeah I'm pretty much like this every day."
1365,2020-03-27 03:26:12,fplqg0,"I wear long acrylic nails
And carry a purse everyday and wear feminine clothing for the most part . But my nails
Are
Always
Long and
I always
Carry a purse"
1366,2020-03-27 04:24:28,fplqg0,"I like James Charles, but I’m actually just here to wish you a happy cake day! We’re twinning"
1367,2020-03-27 06:00:34,fplqg0,"I would love to do full face makeup someday, but for 1. I don't know how and have never attempted and 2. it seems like a lot of work and I'm not that motivated. 

But I do wear mascara and lip gloss quite often, not every day but almost...and currently I have my nails painted glittery pink."
1368,2020-03-27 03:30:00,fplqg0,"I think James Charles is cute. But, my attraction to femboys are the ones that present as a male on the softer side. More fem in mannerisms, slightly fem in dressing, fem voice (not a necessity), etc.. now a male like that that also wears panties all the time.... i will wife you up. Lol."
1369,2020-03-27 06:09:23,fplqg0,"I mean I do makeup, do my hair and just wear what I want to wear. It’s not really about how fem or masculine it be. I just do what looks good on me and do what is comfortable for me."
1370,2020-03-27 07:51:53,fplqg0,"I love his energy and femininity, attitude - I always find myself wondering what it would be like to be more like him - or to be his friend and become more sassy like that."
1371,2020-03-29 00:30:11,fplqg0,"I just intend to have more androgynous expression. Right now, I just live to work so I limit it to... just wearing my work uniform all the time. Lol

Once I start growing out, dying my hair and so forth, I’m just going to slap an electric guitar with it because I want to play and preform music anyway. Being an artist and doing anything and everything for art pretty much gives you the golden ticket of plausible deniability."
1372,2020-03-27 02:31:23,fplqg0,I think he's really fucking hot
1373,2020-03-27 01:05:05,fplqg0,"Honestly I wish I could just do it just to try it and see how it'd make me feel but I'd be too uncomfortable to even try, especially if people I knew or saw me repeatedly saw me and judged me. Maybe if I went somewhere where nobody knows me.. but I'd be worried about safety. Mainly because I'm typically a masculine straight guy"
1374,2020-03-26 23:19:33,fplqg0,Because of circumstances?
1375,2020-03-26 23:19:50,fplqg0,How do you do it? Do you have to live in California lmao
1376,2020-03-27 15:36:13,fplqg0,Why scared?
1377,2020-03-28 19:33:26,fplqg0,"I totally agree! I'm not a x-dresser, lol..just, all the coolest clothes are ""for grrls""as they say..lol btw, u are super prtty!"
1378,2020-03-27 05:24:09,fplqg0,Happy cake day!
1379,2020-03-27 13:16:06,fplqg0,"Well it definitely helps when you look as feminine as you do! 💕 that's cool about the nails and makeup, do you get any comments?"
1380,2020-03-27 14:41:53,fplqg0,I second this. Some mascara and lip gloss do it for me.
1381,2020-03-27 13:21:38,fplqg0,What kind of makeup? Just basic foundation and stuff or do you wear girls makeup?
1382,2020-03-27 01:14:38,fplqg0,I'm not a huge makeup fan on anyone. I like showing my flaws and seeing others. No issues for anyone who likes it though <3!
1383,2020-03-26 23:30:38,fplqg0,"Well its mostly to do with my social group. Not my parents or anything as i do paint my nails and wear more feminine clotging in my own home but i have a feeling me friends wont take it the same way as my parents have. 

Plus there is the money side of it. Clothes aint cheap and right now with the current state of things there are alot of other things i could be spending money on like food mainly. Im trying to work myself out of this situation atm but its very mentaly draining."
1384,2020-03-26 23:23:54,fplqg0,Message me
1385,2020-03-27 20:22:04,fplqg0,"I don't like him or the way he looks. When someone thinks of ""a boy who wears makeup"" James Charles is obviously the first person who comes to mind. I don't want to give off the impression that I'm trying to be like James Charles"
1386,2020-03-29 10:19:24,fplqg0,Haha right. And thanks :)
1387,2020-03-27 07:38:39,fplqg0,Thank you!!!
1388,2020-03-27 15:16:59,fplqg0,"Honestly no, not really in regards to that stuff specifically. I've been misgendered a few times though, which I take as a compliment even though I'm not trans. I do get comments on my hair quite often though, almost always positive which is nice :)"
1389,2020-03-27 14:00:34,fplqg0,"On normal days i just take care of skin and be makeup free. Other days usually full on but I never wear lipstick, and I only do eye looks when I’m in the mood cause it takes a bit to make sure it’s perfect."
1390,2020-03-27 01:34:01,fplqg0,For boys I feel like it's more about feeling feminine than hiding flaws
1391,2020-03-27 01:28:10,fplqg0,Can I ask aswell?
1392,2020-03-27 20:26:56,fplqg0,"What do you not like about him, too much makeup?"
1393,2020-03-27 15:21:49,fplqg0,"Have you always been like this? I feel like a big part of the struggle for many discovering their feminine side is having to tell people or it affecting relationships, especially if you're straight or more into women"
1394,2020-03-27 20:27:42,fplqg0,"His whole look, the makeup, the controversy. He's basically the poster child for men in makeup and I don't want to be associated with that"
1395,2020-03-27 17:49:51,fplqg0,"Yeah, I've been like this pretty much my whole life. I've never had to tell anyone because well I just never had to, it's never really come up as a topic of discussion. It's just who I am :) 

Also, I've never had issues with relationships. It's not like I go after anyone who catches my eye, but I've pretty consistently been in relationships since high school, and now I'm engaged. Being fem you're not going to be everyone's ""type"", but there are certainly people out there who are into it!"

1397,2020-03-27 18:02:28,fplqg0,With women or men?
1398,2020-03-27 22:54:08,fplqg0,"Wasn't he making passes at straight dudes to try and ""turn them gay""? Also he looks like Spiderus, not really what I want people to imagine when I tell them I like to be a femboy"
1399,2020-03-27 18:13:52,fplqg0,"I've only had established/formal relationships with women, but I wouldn't say I'm exclusive to one side."
1400,2020-03-27 18:57:11,fplqg0,"That's awesome, I guess it's because of where you live or that you've always been this way that helps with being accepted. Plus you can pull it off well"
1401,2020-03-27 19:24:14,fplqg0,"Thank you! You're probably right, it's a combination of both. I live in a very socially liberal area so no one really takes a second look at me, and people familiar with me don't think anything about it because I've been like this as long as anyone's known me."
1402,2020-03-27 20:06:17,fplqg0,Where are you from?
1403,2020-03-27 20:47:49,fplqg0,Southern California

1410,2020-03-26 22:17:40,fpkhp7,Lol trust me people Challenge him every day. If you go to mostly black site they definitely do it. One site is lipstick alley. While a mess they make sure everyone knows he is racist trash

1433,2020-03-26 12:11:40,fpa2bm,Idk man this felt a bit overly mean spirited and tbh I dont find joking about drug addiction to be particularly funny
1434,2020-03-26 07:50:00,fp7ajx,"**Here are some thoughts based on 6 years of hindsight:**

* /u/90percent **NAILED** the Jarvis Landry comparison calling him Hines Ward-ish. Became a huge fan favorite

* [There were legit takes saying we were set at WR and didn't need Landry (Hartline/Wallace/Gibson lol)](https://old.reddit.com/r/miamidolphins/comments/256dds/miami_dolphins_select_jarvis_landry_with_their/che6luq/)

* Wow in hindsight that whole rest of the 2014 NFL Draft class was full of bums (minus Aikens ST Ace)

* Everybody went nuts over the DVP draft pick. He finally became what we wanted last season!

* Everyone was so hyped about the Wake/Suh/Vernon/Phillips defensive line :(

* Everybody knew about Ajayi's knee problems - he was still a fantastic 5th round pick cuz 2016

* It's still wild in hindsight thinking how on earth Tunsil fell to us at #13

* [Here's my dumbass remembering not liking taking X over Mackensie Alexander.](https://old.reddit.com/r/miamidolphins/comments/4h26f1/with_the_38th_overall_pick_the_miami_dolphins/d2mqoo8/) I remember reading that X had gotten torched on the deep-ball a few times at Baylor. Mac is out of a job right now while X is one of the best CBs in the league. Oh how nice it is to be wrong.

* /u/bryan_sensei with the great take on Kenyan saying he's a poor man's Reggie Bush

* That Leonte Carroo post is something else. D-Wade celebration cuz of purple shirt man Game 6 vs Charlotte. Rutgers fans gassing up Carroo. Lots of people were PISSED with all the assets we gave up (Carroo was a complete BUM and 3 seasons had 12 catches for us)

* [""WE MISSED ON FOSTER AND LAMP""](https://old.reddit.com/r/miamidolphins/comments/680fgt/de_charles_harris_is_the_pick_at_22_overall/dgupnoz/) on Charles Harris draft post. 1) Foster is a domestic abusing POS who tore his ACL. 2) Lamp has played 9 games in 3 SEASONS with the Chargers. 3) Harris has been completely INVISIBLE his whole tenure with us. What an AWFUL group of candidates we were picking from in the 1st that year.

* [Your friendly reminder this sub also loved and adored Adam Gase.](https://old.reddit.com/r/miamidolphins/comments/680fgt/de_charles_harris_is_the_pick_at_22_overall/dgupsgd/)

* Let's hope McMillan/Tankersley can do something cuz Godchaux has been best of the bunch

* Looks like we were all right about the Minkah pick... hahaha... hah....

* [Dallas Goedert vs. Mike Gesicki](https://old.reddit.com/r/miamidolphins/comments/8fg24h/with_the_42nd_pick_in_the_2018_nfl_draft_the/dy38na0/) will be intriguing to watch long-term

* OOf.... Kalen Ballage.... ugh

* *cough* While all y'all were celebrating trading for Rosen... [some of us knew](https://old.reddit.com/r/miamidolphins/comments/bhtz5i/josh_rosen_to_miami/elvrmv2/)

Yup. Also going back through this - holy crap so many 7th and 6th rounder ssimply don't matter. Vincent Taylor helped a little bit, Sanders is a decent kicker, but Ajayi's our only real standout late pick. Just an important reminder about tempering expectations when we take an O-lineman in the 5th round and say ""O-LINE IS FIXED BOYS!!!!"""

These drafts got me awfy anxious about this upcoming draft haha!"
1437,2020-03-26 11:44:01,fp7ajx,2016 obviously our best overall draft year on this list. How far back do we have to go to find a better overall year? Jimmy Johnson drafts?
1438,2020-03-27 01:13:13,fp7ajx,"I find it funny how X, probably the best player of all this bunch outside of Tunsil, was one of the more controversial in that people didn’t like the trade up and didn’t get why we went with him over guys like Mackensie Alexander. I myself remember being kind of confused with the pick"
1439,2020-03-26 08:11:27,fp7ajx,That 2017 draft was terrible.
1440,2020-03-26 12:54:30,fp7ajx,"I hope this team has learned that waiting till the 2nd or 3rd day to find O-line starter quality does NOT work. Horrible track record for this team the last few years, bust after bust in rounds 3-5"
1441,2020-03-26 10:43:31,fp7ajx,oof thanks for the reminder our front office sucks
1442,2020-03-26 11:15:04,fp7ajx,"My biggest take away here is much everyone loved, LOVED Gase. And honestly he wasn’t that bad, shit, first coach to take Miami to the playoffs in like 20 years. I don’t care the circumstances, easy schedule, we won games we shouldn’t have. I don’t care. We made the playoffs and that’s just some the dolphins don’t do. Tannehill was playing the best football of his career to that point under Gase. I’ll take it.        

Anyway my point is, I wish folks would slow down on the Flores praise. He’s done less than Gase, and most fans hate Gase now. Flores ain’t done shit. If you disagree with that, cool, but same as Gase, we can revisit all the Flores posts in 5 years and see."
1443,2020-03-26 08:15:31,fp7ajx,Davon Godchaux and Bobby McCain are both better standout picks than Ajayi
1444,2020-03-26 15:06:49,fp7ajx,"Man, I could just sense that not taking TJ Watt was going to be our downfall at the time. It just seemed too easy I guess"
1445,2020-03-27 04:53:19,fp7ajx,I was in disbelief when I read this 😂
1446,2020-03-26 18:38:08,fp7ajx,Yeah no shit!
1447,2020-03-26 11:55:16,fp7ajx,"Try 1983

Maybe 1997 - Jason Taylor and Sam Madison"
1448,2020-03-26 10:16:11,fp7ajx,2018 was pretty solid though
1449,2020-03-26 13:15:44,fp7ajx,2 starters and a bunch of drop outs. Idk about terrible but it was pretty bad
1450,2020-03-26 17:36:17,fp7ajx,You can pretty much do this with every team. Hitting on half of your draft picks is the goal. That's why we have so many. Better chances. That's why I wan't to trade down as often as we can for more picks next year. If we can trade down 1 of the first rounders and one of our second rounders that would be amazing. 👌🏻
1451,2020-03-26 12:10:09,fp7ajx,"People lose site that Gase is more of a middling coach than a bad coach. Dude's lowest year was 6-10 with Jay Cutler, he's just gone 7-9 the other years minus his first with us. Flores had a good first year, given everything, but I agree that it's hardly set in stone"
1452,2020-03-26 11:32:59,fp7ajx,"This is exactly how I feel here too, we gotta wait on Flores still, but so far so good.  Gase was definitely liked for a while.  

I think it is probably normal to be an optimist when you get a new coach, though.  But thinking about it, did we ever like Phibin?"
1453,2020-03-26 13:29:41,fp7ajx,Gase definitely regressed. Because of the Tannehill injury we just had no idea how far he regressed.
1454,2020-03-26 20:17:29,fp7ajx,"I agree completely. We won 5 games last year... and it’s tough to tell if those wins were more due to coaching or just because of Fitzpatrick carrying the team to a few wins like he always does no matter who is coaching. Either way, it’s WAY too early to declare Flores the next don Shula after a 5 win season"
1455,2020-03-27 04:24:08,fp7ajx,"The Charles Harris thread? I thought I'd see people bummed we didn't take him, but it was all Foster/Lamp.

I love Lamp."
1456,2020-03-27 00:20:17,fp7ajx,these aren't even a 50% hit rate. it's like 5%
1457,2020-03-26 17:53:34,fp7ajx,"You are correct that Gase is more of a middling coach than a bad coach.  I think the issue is when you combine him being a middling coach with his extreme arrogance and unlikable personality, as well as his unfounded reputation as an offensive mastermind/QB whisperer--that is what rubs people the wrong way."
1458,2020-03-26 18:10:30,fp7ajx,"You bet your ass people here loved Philbin. I hated that guy as a coach, no passion. That time he tried bench Tannehill before London lol. But I remember after his 3rd year he got an extension for 1 year. I keep saying it was a dumb move and Philbin hasn’t done shit and it’s a waste of time and what’s 1 more year with this guy, etc. Folks on this sub didn’t wanna hear it. The big buzz word here around that time was “continuity”. Oh we don’t want to be hiring and firing coaches let’s just ride with Philbin. Lmao so yeah, people here loved Philbin.             

I honestly think 75% of this sub will just roll with whatever the team does, which I can actually get behind on a franchise like the Miami Heat who has proven to make good decisions. I promise when/if Flores sucks and gets fired everyone here will celebrate like we won the super bowl and praise the new hire."
1459,2020-03-26 18:20:08,fp7ajx,Ya he definitely feels worse when he's your coach. Doesn't help that his losses and failures are usually spectacularly bad

1493,2020-04-20 18:41:50,g4y91v,"I won't say it's out of the question we go OL at 33, but it seems unlikely. All offseason our coaches and beat writers have been talking about the improvement in the OL over the last half of the season and basically how they're higher on the unit than most outsiders. Obviously could all be smokescreen but our team affiliated guys are usually on the nose with this stuff."
1494,2020-04-20 19:55:42,g4y91v,"For Tampa, i'd re-draft as:

1.21: Josh Jones, OT

2.45: D'Andre Swift, RB

2.53: Laviska Shenault, WR (bigger need than people think)

3.76: Matt Hennesey, iOL"
1495,2020-04-20 20:14:44,g4y91v,"Regarding the Vikings draft:

Solid round one. I could see them easily going that exact route. Fits our FO mentality, needs, and play styles.

Simpson in round two is bad, and I'm not talking from a value/evaluation standpoint. He does not have the skillset we look for nor need to succeed in our zone blocking system and is not someone we will likely be looking at for that reason, especially that early. Peart/Bartch/Jonah Jackson would have been better fits for OL.

I don't think we'd address CB that early again without addressing some other positions, but if we did, Robertson isn't a bad fit and we've met with him twice (combine and virtually) so there's interest there at the least. But Driscoll is not a good fit for us there. 

You managed to take two OL who would flop in our OL system unfortunately. That's the biggest mistake as the other three make sense from a fit perspective (even though not addressing DT or a second WR would be preferable to a second CB IMO)."
1496,2020-04-20 20:25:49,g4y91v,I don’t hate it for the lions but I wouldn’t be happy at all. I think if gross matos is there in the second we have to take him. We have passed up on edge for too long and Jamie Collins and Zach baun are to similar of players. I think taking a tackle when a interior rusher of gallimore’s potential is there after we just signed big V would be incredibly disappointing. We also need to draft a wide out relatively early and if Bryan Edwards is there at 85 I feel like we would have to take him
1497,2020-04-20 20:35:47,g4y91v,"Really don't like this at all for the Colts. Trading up for Pittman doesn't really make sense, especially when better WRs like Higgins and Aiyuk are still on the board, and Fromm is a big reach at 44. He's got possibly the lowest ceiling of all the QBs in the draft, and that's absolutely not worth spending a mid-2nd round pick on."
1498,2020-04-20 18:26:05,g4y91v,"I’d kill myself if this way the Jags draft. If we’re tanking for a QB, why waste a mid pick on one? Are we really gonna throw away Jawaan Taylor after one year for a worse prospect? Lol"
1499,2020-04-20 18:31:32,g4y91v,It’s hard to tell without it being numbered but it looks like you gave away a ravens second round pick without a trade.
1500,2020-04-20 18:32:37,g4y91v,"I have nothing against Reagor as the pick, I’d like for the Packers to take him, but knowing how that team drafts, I’d be absolutely STUNNED if they left Josh Jones on the board for Reagor at 30, only to reach on a different tackle 2 rounds later.

I know a lot of fan bases think theirs is going to avoid the player with off field concerns, but I can’t remember the last one the Packers drafted. I’d also be very surprised if they went with Gay in the 2nd. I don’t think he’s fit in the locker room with Z, Preston and ARod at all."
1501,2020-04-20 18:33:45,g4y91v,"I don't see Detroit drafting an OT early when they just signed a RT in FA, have Decker at LT, and Crosby as their swing tackle"
1502,2020-04-20 18:36:29,g4y91v,"I think the Pats need more than Kmet with how bad the offense was not just at TE. We currently lack any outside threat at WR and because of that teams just sat the middle of the field while double teaming Edelman and the rest of our guys drowned in man coverage. Pats need a guy with speed to line up outside who teams have to respect. Harry, Edelman, And Sanu aren’t those guys."

So you just made up the weighting for these factors and assigned them to ""Dean Oliver's Four Factors"" in your conclusion.

Then you used the *same exact* four stats in ""Sully's Four Factors"" but weighted them differently this time, and credited yourself.

I'm not saying you're just trying to make yourself look smart here, I mean I'm sure you spent a lot of mind-numbing time plugging in numbers and I think that probably made you lose sight of how this whole thing actually worked out."
1529,2020-04-25 00:46:48,g4w5bp,"This was an average, at best, application of basic statistics to basketball analytics. Any claim that the “Sully Four Factor Rating” is a stronger statistic or better predictor of wins than Dean Oliver’s Four Factors is completely unsubstantiated.  You utilized extremely basic statistical concepts to “prove” that your model is more accurate, and failed to acknowledge the fact that your methodology and measure of accuracy were completely self-fulfilling prophecies.  Your basic, and sometimes flawed, knowledge of statistics became very clear as I read the post, yet for some reason, you claim to be much smarter than a man that not only has a PhD in this field, but is one of the most respected sports analytics minds in the world.  I am only leaving this comment because of the extremely pretentious claims that you made throughout this post, all of which were completely baseless.

“I used the model developed earlier for Dean Oliver’s Four Factor Rating and relied on that good ‘ole analytics technique, *trial and* error.”

I do not know where you got this strategy from, but it is simply wrong.  Rather, these weights should have been found through the use of a multiple regression.  You could have defined the four factors as your independent variables, and Win% as the dependent variable.  This would have allowed your computer to calculate the actually optimal weights of each factor in predicting Win% with a linear model, which I am sure differ slightly from those discovered by your trial and error method.   Your statistics knowledge does not seem to go very far beyond a basic linear regression, as this is the only concept you utilized.

“While Oliver has published his assigned weights for each of the factors individually, I couldn’t find any cases where he merged those separate factors into a single formula.”

Oliver assigned these individual weights by modelling multiple independent variables against a single dependent variable, with an even more advanced technique than a multiple regression, which you did not even use.  Not to mention the fact that you incorrectly expanded the four weights to eight.  You are correct in stating that there are actually eight factors, but your derivation of the eight weights is entirely incorrect.  For example, shooting is *overall* 40%, but a teams own eFG and the opponents are not each 40%. All eight weights also add up to 100%.  The Four Factors is just a simplified version.  You did nothing novel in turning these weights into a formula.  The four weights are a simplified version of a formula that includes all 8 factors.  You then took these incorrect weights, created a formula out of them, and fit a linear regression to them against Win%.  Again, these weights were not created via a linear method.  However, Oliver’s factors are such a strong predictive measure of Win% that they still show a correlation of 0.942, which is a measure of how strong a linear relationship is.  This then leads me to the biggest issue I have with your claim that “Sully’s Four Factor Rating” is better than Oliver’s.

“I believe my new Four Factor Rating is more accurate, not because I am a mathematical genius, but because the weights I stumbled upon happen to coincide perfectly with the evolution of the sport.”

Again, you incorrectly forced Oliver’s weights into a linear model, despite not being formulated via linear methods. You then attempted to create a statistic to find more accurate weights for these four factors.  Your use of “trial and error” was to find the weights that were the strongest linear predictor of Win%, based on correlation.  After finding these weights (which I am still not convinced are the most optimal), you go on to “prove” how your statistic is better than Oliver’s, by using linear measures of accuracy.  I am not sure why you are surprised that your model was a better “predictor” of Win%, when you are using linear metrics to “prove” this.  This work was a completely self-fulfilling prophecy.  You literally tested a *linear* model, and used a *linear* statistic as its measure of accuracy. Obviously this model would perform the best by these measures and with this data.  It is completely over fit to optimize these linear measures of accuracy.  The fact that you barely outperformed your flawed version of Oliver's Four Factors is simply a testament to how unbelievably strong his Four Factors are.

“Suck it NBA. Suck it Doctor Oliver. *I win.”*

I managed at one point to tweak it enough using each teams ranking in each category, and assigning point values based on that. Highest TS%=15 for that team, lowest TS%=-15. It ended up being a very flawed way of thinking(I don’t know why I thought it would work) and has no value if used historically. It doesn’t account for margin of difference in each category. 

But I liked it, simply because ranking each teams cumulative four(technically 8) factors score led to teams being sorted in a similar hierarchy as things like netrating. It shuffled somethings but I ended up with positive scores for 14 teams, negative for the other 16, all 16 being sub .500 teams. I felt teams were ranked accordingly. 

I love seeing other people put in effort, and appreciate things like this. I want to attempt to create another cumulate four factors method, but First, I want to find another statistic to measure FG efficiency. I don’t think TS% is totally accurate, for a number of reasons, though it’s not at all a bad tool to use for evaluation. Just think itd be better to use a statistic which more accurately account for FG diversity and such. I don’t know of any such statistic though, sadly."

1567,2020-04-20 20:39:08,g4w5bp,"Yup, at the end of the day, this game is simply about getting buckets and stopping the other team from getting buckets. There's a slight caveat that not all buckets are worth equal points but the direct effects of that can easily be accounted for when you adjust to points per shot. However we can summarize most of a players or teams value by how well they get buckets/stop the opponent each attempt and how many attempts they can generate. 

Where this may get complicated is when we factor in indirect effects; a player with good shooting ability or knowledge of spacing may increase their teammates' ability to score. Likewise someone may dribble the shit out of the ball and get assists but actually generate less points overall. In addition each team probably has an optimal pace they play at and an optimal pace for when they play opponents, stats that consider all this (and do it well) are probably proprietary and done by NBA front offices. 

However the people who reject the simplest of advanced stats like true shooting percentage just demonstrate a fundamental misunderstanding of basic stats or the game. These stats if you take twenty minutes to think about their construction do not overcomplicate the game, they simply make it really really much simpler. It just simplifies it to bucket making ability and bucket stopping ability, which ironically is what most people profess to be important when they say ""nerds are over analyzing things."" 

If anyone finds OPs analysis even somewhat interesting or the fact that a couple factors can predict 95% of NBA games, I'd encourage you to take two hours and at least look into statistical construction. Its honestly way simpler than it looks and being able to understand some of these things even if it, on the surfsce, tells you something you don't like (some stat says Westbrook sucks or something like that) is a pretty important skill that goes beyond basketball."
1568,2020-04-21 05:31:16,g4w5bp,">Offensive rebounds and turnovers are the two ways that one team gains a possession over their opponent

Pace would lead to more possessions too, though it will also increase opponent possessions but an underrated efficiency stat IMO is quality shots at the end of the quarter. That is 4 possessions that can swing a game. Let's just say for example that the Blazers get 4 quality shots from the top of the 3 pt line at the end of every quarter, and lets say they make them all. That is +12 pts, where the opponent has only 2 opportunities to answer so if you make all the shots at the end of the quarter you gain at least a +6 pt advantage which is equal to about 6 turnovers. But it could be an advantage as large as potentially 24 pts because the Blazers would get the ball back in the following quarter on two occasions. If the opponent doesn't answer any of the shots that is equal to anywhere from 12-24 turnovers, which is almost insurmountable.

&#x200B;

So getting a good shot off at the end of the quarter as opposed to a halfcourt heave is a big-time advantage, as long as you hit the shots. Any shot made is equal to at least 2 turnovers though....It's almost an unfair advantage that can ruin the competitive balance. A very easy tweak to the rules would be to let the team with the balls the end have one full possession of 24 seconds if the quarter ends, and also if that is the rule, a team wouldn't get the ball back if they score (just like any other possession during the course of the game).

&#x200B;

Edit: my math was slightly wrong. It would only be 3 possessions in most cases as obviously the game doesn't continue after the 4th quarter. Still doesn't change the advantage much though! Anywhere from +3 to +18 which is equivalent to 3-18 turnovers."

I made a halfass attempt in my iPhone notes and got something that halfass worked. As a matter of fact, I did something that made absolutely no logical sense to do. I just made a scoreboard lol. 

So as I understood it, the real idea behind 4 factors is to equally distribute and weigh the rate of each possible outcome of a teams Offensive/Defensive possessions, at least thats what I saw it as. Maybe asking a dumb question here(It’s been a while), but Free Throw Rate measures FTA, NOT FTM correct? And EFG% doesn’t factor in FTA or FTM? So how did you account for FT%? 

From what I’ve seen about TS%, the biggest issue with it is that in a lot of cases, it doesn’t weigh the possible points per FGA/FTA properly. It’s apparently pretty common to see a perfect TS% exceed 100%. for example, a player with a TS% of 62% may seem nice, but it’s possible it could actually be 62 out of 108, so not nearly as good. Lol. EFG% I believe, doesn’t factor free throws, and although it rewards made threes, it doesn’t penalize for missed threes. So your benefitted more for making a 3, but not penalized at all even though you’re leaving more points on the board, if ya know what I mean."

Edit:  sorry, I misread your comment.  They are the same thing.  In the first example Team A goes from +1 to +0 with the missed shot, then back to +1 by getting the rebound.  In the second Team A goes from +1 to +0 with the missed shot, then to -1 when Team B gets the rebound, then from -1 to +1 by getting the steal.

That's why the steals are worth twice as much as rebounds.  They advance the game state more favourably for your team (since starting with the ball already gives you good expected odds of scoring)."

In the OneDrive folder linked at the bottom of the post there is an excel file called “Scratch Work”. At the far right you can see where I did this exact exercise:

I broke up the 20 seasons (99-04, 05-11, 12-19) and ran corr analysis for DOFF, NBA PIE and SullyFF to see if the various time periods skewed the results. 

https://i.imgur.com/IdX2uAm.jpg

e. I see you edited your comment a lot. 

if it was so easy to just ""slap it into a formula"" how come Dean Oliver never did it? 


The “real statistical effect” was evidenced when the models were applied to the 2020 data set and the SullyFF was more accurate by nearly a full percentage point. 

Not sure what you’re even getting at... is the Higgs Boson not legit because Peter Higgs **didn't** discover the Theory of Relativity himself? Everything is built off the work done by those who came before us."

Then makes his own formula with the goal of maximizing correlation, which ""Oliver's"" are not even meant to do, and claims to be a genius because his self-fulfilling prophecy became true.  ""Suck it Dean Oliver"" - None of those formulas are Dean Olivers!! They are both this idiots shitty formulas."
1611,2020-04-20 18:44:44,g4w5bp,"Well, if I wanted to bullshit it, I would have just plugged the 8 factors into a regression analysis and used the coefficients as the weightings. I could have gotten a 96%+ correlation but the weighting’s would be all over the place:

Weighting Team Rebounding at .0172867
And Opp Rebounding at -.01477

Or 

Weighting team eFG% at .045704
And Opp eFG% at -.046697

You see how that is a problem? 

The weightings needed to be applied consistently across the factors (team&opp). I wanted the Sully FF weighting to makes sense in *basketball* terms. Thus, my updated weighting’s are simplified to 50/30/15/5.

Hope that makes sense! Thanks for reading :)"

Yes, I did that! In the OneDrive folder linked at the bottom of the post, there is a workbook called ""Scratch Work"" where I did a regression on all 8 Factors. 

[https://imgur.com/a/ISxGk9P](https://imgur.com/a/ISxGk9P)

If I used strictly the regression coefficients (instead of the intuitive weightings) I could have achieved a 96%+ correlation. However, I wanted the weightings to make sense in basketball terms so I needed to find weightings that could be applied across the Team and Opp 4 Factors equally.

Dean Oliver did do it, where do you think those weights come from????  Those 4 weights come from a formula that includes all 8 factors.  He didn't just pull them out of his ass.  You then incorrectly expanded his 4 back to 8, with two formulas.  All 8 factors add up to 100%. The 4 factors is a simplified version that, for example, combines eFG% and opponent eFG% into one broad category called shooting.  Overall shooting is 40%, each could be 20%, or a different mix."

The 4 Factors are just a simplified version.  40% shooting does not mean a team's eFG% and opponent eFG% are each worth 40%.  This mean that overall, shooting is 40% of the game.  Taking into account all 8 factors means that your own shooting could be worth 30% and the opponents worth 10%. But overall, shooting comes out to 40%.

1693,2020-04-21 05:34:34,g4r6lm,The stacks of smurfs and the bugs made me piss and shit and ditch the game
1694,2020-04-20 20:05:16,g4r6lm,This is painful to think about.
1695,2020-04-20 18:27:31,g4r6lm,well I smurf and I don‘t see the problem. Edit: Thanks for the feedback. I still won’t stop smurfing as I play highelo on both main and smurf. Edit 2: Thanks for the deathwish.
1696,2020-04-20 21:34:27,g4r6lm,Why
1697,2020-04-20 22:41:14,g4r6lm,"Marly: *Does same revolver kill as hes done many times*


His friends: OMFG HOW?! JUST HOW?! HIS SKILLS ARE UNPARELLELED, PLEASE SUBSCRIBE TO MEATY MARLY ON YOUTUBE.COM/MEATYMARLY"
1698,2020-04-20 20:26:11,g4r6lm,I mean. So many YouTubers do that kinda trash stuff and it's so annoying tbh
1699,2020-04-20 18:45:51,g4r6lm,"fuck Marly, he's a toxic tryhard"
1700,2020-04-20 22:36:32,g4r6lm,He doesn't. He plays casual and has fun.
1701,2020-04-20 20:34:36,g4r6lm,When
1702,2020-04-21 02:00:35,g4r6lm,Why should I? I don’t ruin anyone’s experience.
1703,2020-04-21 02:01:37,g4r6lm,Why am I a brick? Others seem to believe cowards fits better.
1704,2020-04-20 18:53:05,g4r6lm,King George is a spastic loser
1705,2020-04-20 19:52:08,g4r6lm,"I only just noticed, you have an eye for good dongs"
1706,2020-04-20 22:19:16,g4r6lm,Exactly
1707,2020-04-21 02:02:29,g4r6lm,Nah cheaters will.
1708,2020-04-21 02:03:21,g4r6lm,Cheaters and glitches do.
1709,2020-04-20 21:59:26,g4r6lm,[Nah fam I'm talking about the only and best James Charles out there ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCucot-Zp428OwkyRm2I7v2Q)
1710,2020-04-21 02:06:01,g4r6lm,Yeah. Usually the smurf is on the same elo as the main.
1711,2020-04-21 04:40:04,g4r6lm,I’m joking
1712,2020-04-20 18:01:51,g4r6lm,Fuck you
1713,2020-04-20 18:28:32,g4r6lm,There are people out there who just want to have fun. :)
1714,2020-04-20 18:15:03,g4r6lm,[deleted]
1715,2020-04-20 19:48:53,g4r6lm,It ruins the game for everyone but you. I like to have fun but when I'm level 100 I shouldn't be going up against level 300s. I'm going to lose .
1716,2020-04-20 21:32:59,g4r6lm,This guy is what's wrong with this game
1717,2020-04-20 19:21:37,g4r6lm,Why?
1718,2020-04-20 22:13:53,g4r6lm,You’re an idiot
1719,2020-04-20 22:13:41,g4r6lm,You’re just a little bitch tbh
1720,2020-04-21 02:08:11,g4r6lm,Isn’t newcomer this only smurf playlist?
1721,2020-04-20 19:49:14,g4r6lm,Yeah it just drains the fun out of the game because you’re not really playing against the same level of competition. Most of the time we are playing against people below our level being carried by someone way higher than our level. And it happens every other game to me and my friends now
1722,2020-04-20 20:41:07,g4r6lm,When I was in gold I played against the sweatiest plat 3 to gold 3 smurf ever. I know how it feels. You are not the only one. The bad thing is. In higher ranks it ain't better. All my friends and I are low to mid diamond and 1 of them has created a plat 2 account just to get some lower ranked friends higher. The bad thing is he uses that acc also when WE play together. The 1000 mmr cap is waaaaaay to high. I think 500 should be the maximum difference.
1723,2020-04-20 20:49:04,g4r6lm,"I feel you, it’s even worse in league. Bronze 3 and I somehow got queued up with a plat 2"
1724,2020-04-20 22:37:28,g4r6lm,How did you get past silvers Smurfs
1725,2020-04-20 21:40:50,g4r6lm,"Sry i don't see a problem with playing against Plat 3 as Gold 2. That's just 2 ranks apart.
Most of the time i play in a 4-5 man squad with ranks from Silver 2 to Gold 1. Of course the higher ranked players get more consistent kills, but my silver mate(s) or not helpless at all and sometimes even outperform me. It's important, that the MMR of the whole team equals the mmr of the enemy team."
1726,2020-04-20 22:33:15,g4r6lm,"Yeah last season I got stuck in the gold 3 to hold 2 loop where you just find a game of Smurfs and you go right back down, this season I got to gold 1 and now I'm in the plat 3 gold 1 loop, nice"
1727,2020-04-20 23:01:06,g4r6lm,"I don't understand why a Smurf would want to play in gold? Sorry, why a plat Smurf would derank to gold??( On a alt account to play golds??)  Smurfs are in copper- silver. They do it to play against coppers, for easy games. Maybe it's just hard to get out of gold into plat... Oh wait it is. Gold is the most sweat filled of all the ranks...  Pfft"
1728,2020-04-21 00:15:37,g4r6lm,"I will always remember the ranked match that became one of the biggest reasons why I quit this game.

Highest rank on my team was a random that just got gold 2 while I was the second highest having just reached gold 3. Went against 3 plats (2 of them being known diamond smurfs) and 2 golds that were less than 20 points from plat.

At least it went better than casual, which constantly matches me against different 5-stacks of diamonds. I swear I've played against every single diamond player from my region."
1729,2020-04-21 01:08:45,g4r6lm,Lol hey if you don’t like getting dunked on by alt accounts then you don’t like siege lol what a piss take
1730,2020-04-21 01:46:19,g4r6lm,Because you are playing casual and casual has a stupid hidden mmr system
1731,2020-04-20 23:15:33,g4r6lm,"smurf =/= alt

Smurfs are the people that intentionally derank to play against people below their skill level."
1732,2020-04-21 01:16:47,g4r6lm,My friends and I have been playing for 4 years and have been grinding the game and watch videos and pros. We all consistently get between 4-8k each but when we get one game from or into plat 3 we just get DUNKED on by diamond alt accounts. And if it was rare it wouldn’t be annoying but every game we get into (Xbox sadly) and see a level 50 with under 1k gamer score and we all start laughing and go gg ez clap against us lol
1733,2020-04-20 18:46:11,g4r6lm,"you cant, probably because you are the problem"
1734,2020-04-20 19:09:29,g4r6lm,"ranks are there to make players play with people that are roughly the same skill you are, by smurfing you bypass that to bully worse people. So sincerely F#@k You."
1735,2020-04-20 21:08:38,g4r6lm,neanderthal
1736,2020-04-20 21:02:06,g4r6lm,It’s because of you people and toxic people that I uninstalled the game
1737,2020-04-20 21:10:29,g4r6lm,That's what a mirror's for.
1738,2020-04-20 20:44:29,g4r6lm,"If you don't see the problem, you are the problem. If you can't play against your own rank you're a coward. It's a game. You lose. You win. Smurfing is worse than hacking"
1739,2020-04-20 23:39:41,g4r6lm,"0head, braindead take."
1740,2020-04-21 03:26:55,g4r6lm,Came to da wrong chat pardner
1741,2020-04-21 04:30:22,g4r6lm,lol i don’t think a single person downvoting you understands the difference between a smurf & an alt account
1742,2020-04-20 23:37:19,g4r6lm,"Go look in a mirror, this game has a level based matchmaking system for a reason, if you can't win at your own level get better at the game."
1743,2020-04-21 00:53:15,g4r6lm,"They say ""mate"" nonstop it's super annoying."
1744,2020-04-20 20:27:34,g4r6lm,"Even matimio, while I like his mailbox videos, most if not all his clips are from casual lmao."
1745,2020-04-20 20:38:52,g4r6lm,Yesterday
1746,2020-04-21 06:31:36,g4r6lm,The ranked system matches golds with golds diamonds with diamonds think what happens if it matches golds with diamonds
1747,2020-04-20 20:13:39,g4r6lm,Sad piece of shit he is
1748,2020-04-21 06:14:43,g4r6lm,"Well, yeah, but smurfs ruin matchmaking, cus there is nothing fun or fair when me and my friends meet  a 3 stack of smurf, what the fuck are we supposed to do"
1749,2020-04-20 22:00:12,g4r6lm,I am very confused but ok
1750,2020-04-20 20:09:41,g4r6lm,Why do i have a feeling you're the same person.
1751,2020-04-21 01:17:44,g4r6lm,No worries my smurf and my main are 200 MMR apart. There won’t be a difference if I am on my main or on my  smurf.
1752,2020-04-21 01:19:09,g4r6lm,Why? I am not cheating. I am not using glitches.
1753,2020-04-21 01:26:33,g4r6lm,Because I don’t want to sweat all day. I want to soloq. On the smurf I don’t care about my rank and my playstyle is more aggressive. Due to that I take more gunfights with more convidence and my overall aim improves. I roughly play on the same elo as my main tough.
1754,2020-04-20 22:16:31,g4r6lm,You cracked the code sherlock.
1755,2020-04-20 21:57:24,g4r6lm,Hot take: it’s also not fun playing with a smurf because they just get all the kills and you don’t get to do anything
1756,2020-04-20 20:08:30,g4r6lm,yeah exactly. fix ranked
1757,2020-04-20 23:15:08,g4r6lm,"Holy fuck the silver Smurfs are the worst. I used to hit gold and plat because I could help carry some of the weight for my less experienced friends, but now I can't because of gold/play/diamond Smurfs coming in and fucking about while destroying my team (and me!). Not to mention that I can still match with Gold 1's and 2's while my team is half bronze and half silver. Absolutely ridiculous."
1758,2020-04-20 21:57:39,g4r6lm,2 ranks is so many wins tho. bronze 1 and bronze 3 are 2 appart. it’s way different at higher ranks. you have to look at mmr not rank
1759,2020-04-21 01:51:31,g4r6lm,??? ranked
1760,2020-04-20 23:36:09,g4r6lm,Yeah I know what the difference is. When I say that most smurfs are plats I'm talking about their main accounts. But yeah lots of people do not know the difference between them
1761,2020-04-21 01:09:28,g4r6lm,Why am I the problem? My smurfs are one rank below my main account. I don’t ruin anybodies match.
1762,2020-04-21 01:11:20,g4r6lm,There is no difference if I play on my smurf or my main. The difference is about 200 MMR. I don’t bully anyone.
1763,2020-04-21 01:12:47,g4r6lm,Really? I don’t think you left this game because someone like me was in your lobby. But I agree the community is pretty toxic.
1764,2020-04-21 01:21:59,g4r6lm,Why am I the problem? You don’t know anything about me.
1765,2020-04-20 21:46:13,g4r6lm,"> Smurfing is worse than hacking

Ehhh I don't know that I'd go THAT far"
1766,2020-04-21 01:06:58,g4r6lm,My smurfs are one rank below my main. Why am I the problem. I play against people on my lvl if I play rank. Otherwise I couldn’t improve and that just stupid.
1767,2020-04-21 01:16:06,g4r6lm,Why braindead?
1768,2020-04-21 08:09:36,g4r6lm,I kinda noticed.
1769,2020-04-21 01:15:03,g4r6lm,I can win at my lvl. Thats why there is about 200 MMR difference between my main and my smurf.
1770,2020-04-20 20:59:46,g4r6lm,"Well, YouTubers have to do it because if they go into ranked, they're just gonna go against sweats and smurfs. They go into casual just to give us the content and enjoy the game. Imagine the amount of cheaters and sweats they would run into in a ranked especially after the enemy see who they are."
1771,2020-04-20 22:17:30,g4r6lm,"I'd rather see casual clips than ""EPIC ACE SITE RETAKE"" filmed in copper 4."
1772,2020-04-20 20:46:55,g4r6lm,Ok
1773,2020-04-21 01:35:35,g4r6lm,[deleted]
1774,2020-04-20 21:16:56,g4r6lm,[deleted]
1775,2020-04-21 03:17:27,g4r6lm,So it’s not a smurf account
1776,2020-04-21 01:20:30,g4r6lm,"Technically, you are cheating. You're abusing the game so that you get out against bad players. Fuck you."
1777,2020-04-21 02:05:25,g4r6lm,"That’s fair, but with what you said you could make the argument that you could just play casual or unranked. Both provide you with a sweat-free game and the same space for you to practice."
1778,2020-04-20 22:05:03,g4r6lm,"Yeah I hate being completely carried, completely carrying my team, or even worse when the whole team is getting dunked on"
1779,2020-04-20 23:04:48,g4r6lm,"This. 

Yes it’s nice to get a win. But it sucks bad when you’ve hardly stepped foot into the building or hardly moved from site as a defender and suddenly all the enemies are dead."
1780,2020-04-20 20:17:01,g4r6lm,I feel like it wouldn’t be that hard imo. Rocket league fixed there’s and it’s working pretty fine there
1781,2020-04-21 01:29:58,g4r6lm,this is why i stay in copper v
1782,2020-04-20 22:22:19,g4r6lm,"It's pretty common for me to travel between Gold 2 and Plat 3 up and down. I'am currently 1 MMR before reaching Plat 3 again after being Gold 2 last week. *Cries in Gold.* So 2 Ranks are a lot of wins in series but easy to climb and fall in just a short amount of time. I really appreciate that the MMR System is so transparent, especially if you compare it to CS or RL."
1783,2020-04-20 23:13:56,g4r6lm,"If you get Plat 2 you can easily go up against 5 stacks of pros, the skill difference between gold 2 and plat 3 tinny. Plat 3 and Plat 2 is a bigger skill gap by a longshot. 

The thing that sucks for average (gold 3) to slightly above average players (gold 2) is that everyone starts at 2500 so a diamond who just leveled up their alt will play against you even if for them it's only 2-3 games. Having an alt is fine so I can't really get pissed at the diamond so long as they aren't intentionally deranking."
1784,2020-04-21 01:53:22,g4r6lm,Then they are probs playing with a silver 2 or something to even the mmr difference dont worry tho us plats get smurfed on by diamonds stacks too
1785,2020-04-21 02:24:48,g4r6lm,"yesssss dumbass i dont fking care if youre already below your main, but the process you getting there ruins other people’s games, people quit because of you."
1786,2020-04-21 02:09:23,g4r6lm,"yes but you dont just magically go to one rank below you, imagine having a diamond player on a gold lobby, thats not fair, you would feel like shit, all that hardwork mmr that we just did goes down the drain because of people like you, yeah i get you tryna play rank and chill, but the process of you getting to 200mmr below your main is still affecting other players."
1787,2020-04-21 02:49:21,g4r6lm,Then it's not smurf but more like an alt account
1788,2020-04-21 01:20:38,g4r6lm,"Yes I did there were to many smurfs and toxic people where at that point I couldn’t enjoy the game atleast in csgo I could play retake servers with higher rank players that are not as toxic but in seige for lower players like me it’s really toxic and really smurfy 

I know why I left and many people uninstall the game because of smurfs, hackers and toxic people"
1789,2020-04-21 02:57:50,g4r6lm,"You smurf, smurfs are the problem, garbage-tier troll there."
1790,2020-04-20 21:50:01,g4r6lm,"I would. I mean yeah you can't see through walls and stuff but you can literally fuck somebody's elo cuz you are just shitting on them with your acc you bought just like someone buys a hack program. The only thing is that you can't get banned for smurfing. And if you can prove to ubi a person is hacking in your game your elo will get reset. Even if you win or lose because that person if cheating. But if somebody is smurfing your elo won't get reset even tho that person should've never been there in the first place

Edit : grammar"
1791,2020-04-20 22:58:59,g4r6lm,"No.
Hackers know they are doing terrible shit, and you can accept that you will lose a game.

Smurfs are worse.
They think it's fine, and you think you are just having a bad game or you think you aren't good enough for your rank.

Ranks exist for a reason."
1792,2020-04-23 00:29:02,g4r6lm,"Then fucking do it. Smurfing does nothing other than bottleneck the game, if someone on a free weekend is genuinely considering the game getting clapped by a level 2 Jäger is really gonna throw them off."
1793,2020-04-20 22:12:59,g4r6lm,[deleted]
1794,2020-04-21 09:43:59,g4r6lm,Yea but he shouldn't scream and say OMG everytime he gets a kill against a low-skilled player or multiple kills.
1795,2020-04-21 09:57:28,g4r6lm,He literally doesn't stop playong the game and smurfs constantly
1796,2020-04-20 21:32:10,g4r6lm,"Ironic you're calling other people loser. Your profile screams ""Pathetic"""
1797,2020-04-21 01:37:21,g4r6lm,So platin 1 players are bad?
1798,2020-04-21 02:09:44,g4r6lm,Nope because I play against different/worse opponents. If I don’t play against my elo I won’t improve where I need to.
1799,2020-04-20 22:15:27,g4r6lm,"It’s actually fun for me when u carry, because I feel like powerful, but I also don’t smurf. I firmly believe that smurfing is bad for the game and that smurfs hurt the game"
1800,2020-04-20 21:48:11,g4r6lm,How? (I'm not in disagreement or anything I just want to know)
1801,2020-04-20 22:13:26,g4r6lm,"It's hard af every single game struggles, even third party matchmaking systems in CSGO that are used primarily for a better ranking system still struggle with it."
1802,2020-04-20 22:59:36,g4r6lm,How did they fix it?
1803,2020-04-21 02:30:14,g4r6lm,How? At the beginning of the season everybody is unrank.
1804,2020-04-21 02:12:15,g4r6lm,No its not. My main is diamond and my smurf is Plat one. There is literally no difference.
1805,2020-04-21 02:52:30,g4r6lm,Idk everybody I know is calling it smurf. Even if you watch twitch they say thy will switch accounts and go on their smurf. So to my understanding a smurf is not your main account.
1806,2020-04-21 01:36:48,g4r6lm,Well I don’t play in lower levels. I play on high elo with all my accounts. The reason for having a smurf imo is to just chill and don’t take rank so seriously. You have a different mindset and play better against people who are on your elo just because it is not so important to you. I have chat off and only play 5 stack so I don’t experience the toxicity part (Well atleast as long as I don’t write smth. on reddit about having a smurf). The only problem are the cheaters. I don’t think they exist in low elo because they usually boost people but it is so annoying and the never get banned. I play about 20 cheaters this season and it devastating. After such a match all your momentum is gone and you have to make a break. In addition to this you will never see your elo again.
1807,2020-04-20 21:55:32,g4r6lm,"I think both are bad, but hacking is a lot more risk/reward. You risk getting banned, but you can hack to the point where you’re auto locking on to heads and walking through walls. At least with a smurf they still have to follow the rules of the game. They may be better, but you still have a shot. With hackers, sometimes, you literally just won’t have a chance"
1808,2020-04-20 23:04:22,g4r6lm,"Generally you have an idea of who a smurf is. There are telltale signs like low ranks, weird names, etc. Both are bad, but I'd much rather go up against a smurf and have a chance at winning than go against a hacker and have no chance."
1809,2020-04-21 14:34:00,g4r6lm,"I’ve played against Marley in ranked before. Dude is legit good at the game. He was duo queuing with Anthony Pitt, but was carrying his team for the most part."
1810,2020-04-20 22:23:04,g4r6lm,"At this point in siege, you're bound to have one cheater every match, and Ubi won't do anything about it, and the point is not for Marley or anyone to be good. It's just for people to watch and get a laugh. I'm sure if you were in their position you wouldn't want to put out a 10-minute video of you getting rekt, you want your best and funniest clips."

1813,2020-04-20 22:33:21,g4r6lm,I do like being top frag but I meant like getting tons of kills but your team isn't doing anything and you still lose
1814,2020-04-21 01:59:10,g4r6lm,It depends. If your smurf is not in low elo and on the same elo as your main I don’t see the problem.
1815,2020-04-21 01:03:12,g4r6lm,"So in 3v3 in rocket league, if you’re in a party of 2 or 3, it matches the rank of the highest player in your party. So if one person in your party of 3 is a low diamond and one is a plat and one is a gold, it will put you up against all low diamonds. 
So if that’s implemented in siege, if there’s a plat 3 and 4 silvers in a team then it will put them against all plat 3s basically instead of all golds which siege matchmaking is like now"

1817,2020-04-21 02:33:43,g4r6lm,"omg bro, if its at the beginning of the season i dont care but when youre in the middle of the season when everyone is ranked already, then your shitty ass just got  your rank as gold 1, what does that mean? that means a fucking diamond is playing in a gold lobby. is that fair? is that a way to practice? no bitch thats demotivation and makes u wanna uninstall. id just slap tf out of every smurfs man."
1818,2020-04-21 02:14:11,g4r6lm,"yeah but did you go to plat one immediately?? no right? you had to go through at least gold 2, gold 1 then plat 3 and plat 2."
1819,2020-04-20 21:58:09,g4r6lm,True

1823,2020-04-20 23:09:41,g4r6lm,Oh yeah that’s the worst
1824,2020-04-21 02:17:44,g4r6lm,"Then it’s not really a smurf, then it’s a alternate account"
1825,2020-04-21 01:28:58,g4r6lm,"Wait I thought Rainbow already had it. Oh boy, I agree it should be implemented, R6 can't be called competitive"
1826,2020-04-21 02:48:00,g4r6lm,Who starts ranking in the middle of the season?
1827,2020-04-21 04:34:10,g4r6lm,"Last I checked, Marley was like plat 1 but ok

Edit: he’s plat 2, but those ranked stats don’t lie 😳"
1828,2020-04-21 02:20:16,g4r6lm,Well atleast everybody I know calls them smurfs.
1829,2020-04-21 02:52:25,g4r6lm,"No it’s not. I wish it would change because it’s such a joke of a system. One game I played against a silver 2, level 43 in the game (obvious alt account) who went 13 and 5 and his two buddies were plat 2s and went 3 and 5 each. Went to round 9 and lost 5-4 in OT."
1830,2020-04-21 02:55:33,g4r6lm,omg i dont have the energy to talk to dumb people
1831,2020-04-21 02:22:38,g4r6lm,"A smurf is when a good player tanks to play with bad players, smurf with equal elo to your main isn’t a smurf"

1857,2020-04-19 23:37:22,g4hjv4,Give us the New Mutants. All of them.

That and not so much characters but I want to see uniforms based on the Fear Itself arc so both Worthy and Mighty uniforms. Could be an excuse to bring in characters like Red She-Hulk and the Serpent.

Also be able to update some characters as a result too like Iron Fist, Titania and Absorbing Man."

Justice and Firestar are mutants.  Donald Pierce isn't (he's a cyborg!).  With Darkstar and Ursa Major on there, Darkstar's brother Vanguard deserves a spot (he's even the current Red Guardian)."

It feels like the end of Marvel Avengers Alliance, they're releasing characters that most people don't have extensive experience with so excitement for even good releases is waned. By the end of MAA the developers were really doing an amazing job but no one cared for Ka-Zar and Spitfire."

Dracula would be cool too..."

1870,2020-04-20 01:43:48,g4hjv4,"Well after the Warriors of the Sky why not add in the peeps from Big Hero 6. Would make for a decent epic quest. The Native T2 would be Baymax/Hiro (combat?), the crystal unlock could be Callaghan(combat villain) and then the rest of the team would be your regular unlocks.

Fred - combat

Go Go - speed

Wasabi - combat

Honey Lemon - speed"

Your dad disregarding something on TV doesn't show anything about how he will feel about his own sons sexuality. 

My father used to make plenty of jokes that I took offense to as a youthful bisexual. After coming out he has been my biggest support. Still makes jokes, but now it is in good fun."
1884,2020-04-19 23:07:54,g4hdye,Honestly that that's rough. Try to keep in mind it wasn't directed at you though... Totally get why you would feel sad still. Stay strong 💕💜💙

Now think, your dad may either be: not a fan of james Charles or Just wanting your sister not to watch to much tv or may be not like boys wearing makeup or he might be homophobe (but he may not know that james charles is gay).

1907,2020-04-19 21:19:38,g4ezn2,"First, respect all the work you put into this.

That said, I think there’s little to no chance the Jets trade up. It’s JD’s first draft. He’s far from desperate to win now and the Jets have a lot of holes to fill."
1908,2020-04-19 21:28:40,g4ezn2,"As an Eagles fan, this is close to what I’m hoping for. Trading away next year’s 1st stings but I think it’s crucial to get a potential #1 WR for Wentz moving forward."

1911,2020-04-19 20:43:25,g4ezn2,I am assuming you are a cowboys fan because you’re the only person who actually picked our needs throughout the rounds
1912,2020-04-19 23:03:13,g4ezn2,Not great for the lions at all. We need IDL not a safety. We just traded for Harmon and already have Tracy Walker and will harris also if we pick up a 2nd second round pick we most likely would go wide out. Uche would be great in the third though
1913,2020-04-19 21:43:27,g4ezn2,"Not a fan of the trade down for raiders in the 1st. Trade out and miss on a WR and CJ Henderson to get AJ Terrell? All just to get a 3rd round pick?

No thanks."
1914,2020-04-19 20:52:41,g4ezn2,The offseason content we need but don’t deserve
1915,2020-04-19 21:21:59,g4ezn2,"This is a good draft for Denver, really my only complaint is I’d prefer a center in the third instead of a second cb, and I’d maybe go after a second wr a little sooner. Nice work"
1916,2020-04-20 02:02:12,g4ezn2,"Nice work. Looks like a lot of work went into this. I’ve been researching hard recently since draft day is so close and I see based on some of these moves that you have been as well.

I just wanted to ask about the Jets and Cardinals. All I’ve seen is the Jets moving back and not up. What lead you to predict this, especially with only 1 tackle off the board?"
1917,2020-04-19 21:01:47,g4ezn2,Nice
1918,2020-04-20 01:31:59,g4ezn2,I love this

1920,2020-04-20 03:12:09,g4ezn2,Very solid for the Chargers
1921,2020-04-20 04:55:27,g4ezn2,Love this draft for Denver. Two immediate starters in Jeudy and Arnette. Wanogho and Wilson are great players as well.
1922,2020-04-20 14:37:16,g4ezn2,"Big props for the 7-rounder. It's not easily done and takes a lot of prep to do it right. Kudos on that. 

Only thing I would really change as a Titans fan is that we have to go with a CB with nickel ability on Day 1 or 2. I would have loved to added Amik over Gibson in round 3, for example. Also, we have another 7th that you're missing (I think 244?)

Big props for it man. The Davidson pick/value is a dream and I would love to see that IRL."
1923,2020-04-19 22:08:32,g4ezn2,"Trading up to get Jordyn Brooks in second is questionable, but not getting and defensive line help for the Cardinals and instead taking a kicker despite already having a decent one is horrible"
1924,2020-04-19 22:49:01,g4ezn2,"Bears fan here. Love the Cush pick at 43, but don’t like Davis at 50, when you have 3 safeties (Winfield, Duggar & Chinn) who are generally rated higher still on the board. If anything, I’d be making a trade to fall back & get any of the 4 over taking Davis there."

1926,2020-04-19 23:57:50,g4ezn2,"Williams is an upgrade for sure but Steelers don’t really need a LT and can’t afford Williams anyway. Also you have us giving up a 3rd, 4th, and next year’s 3rd to move up 13 spots in the 3rd? Dumb. Even worse to take Hurts."
1927,2020-04-20 00:19:34,g4ezn2,"Aj Terrell at 16? I like kinlaw but passing on ruggs? Then taking Bowden,  people's jones. Bad raider picks man. I'd have taken claypool in the 3rd over t
those two. What did the raider get in return to move down ?"
1928,2020-04-20 00:53:18,g4ezn2,Thank you for making one of the worst Browns drafts I’ve ever seen
1929,2020-04-20 01:11:53,g4ezn2,I've said it before and I will say it again. If we take Thad Moss in the 3rd I will stick my leg into a woodchipper.
1930,2020-04-20 02:37:10,g4ezn2,"Packers almost certainly have Amik Robertson off their board, he’s 5’8” and the Packers are very picky about height (5’10.5 or better) and it was notable when they deviated even half an inch for Jaire Alexander"
1931,2020-04-20 03:33:00,g4ezn2,"I’ll be shocked if Green Bay waits until the 6th round to pick an OT, and doesn’t take a LB at all. Even after signing Wagner and Kirksy they’re the two biggest holes besides WR, and certainly higher priority than corner."
1932,2020-04-20 11:03:11,g4ezn2,Very big fan of this for the Panthers
1933,2020-04-20 12:06:51,g4ezn2,"Honestly I would be pretty happy with this draft minus S McKinney in the 2nd round (with Blacklock and Gallimore available) and RB JJ Taylor over TCU’s Darius Anderson in the 7th round (unless I didn’t see his name listed). 

Walker - 2018 3rd round pick
Harris - 2019 3rd round pick
Killebrew - Resigned 
Kearse - Signed 
Harmon - trade 

Why would the Lions draft a safety in the 2nd round?"
1934,2020-04-21 19:02:29,g4ezn2,Bryce Hall is a really weird pick. Doesn’t fit Nolan’s scheme at all
1935,2020-04-19 21:06:10,g4ezn2,You had us trade up for claypool? Third is too early for Moss. I think qb is a wasted pick. We dont need another cb.
1936,2020-04-19 20:54:40,g4ezn2,Good draft for the Eagles addressed every need except S and C but those aren’t immediate needs. Could you give the details to the trades? I’m curious how the Eagles got up that high without giving up 53 (I assume next year’s first?).
1937,2020-04-19 21:35:40,g4ezn2,Why would we take a CB in the 4th he probably wouldn't even make the roster.
1938,2020-04-19 21:49:43,g4ezn2,Steelers trading for Trent Williams is terrible. We dont have any cap space.
1939,2020-04-19 21:05:31,g4ezn2,I'm not sure why the Eagles would give up a future first instead of this year's second. Do you just think that's what the cost is gonna be? I'd like to hear your reasoning on that
1940,2020-04-19 21:26:30,g4ezn2,The panthers don’t need a wr
1941,2020-04-19 22:11:49,g4ezn2,God anyone but cushenberry for the bears
1942,2020-04-19 22:32:28,g4ezn2,I will not be happy if we draft a TE
1943,2020-04-19 20:58:35,g4ezn2,Sorry man but this is horrible formatting. I appreciate the effort but it shouldn’t take me 5 minutes to see all of the Steelers picks
1944,2020-04-19 20:57:12,g4ezn2,"I was wondering that as well. I feel like a trade up to 10 would have to include their 2020 2nd rounder at least.

I really can't see them giving up a future first"
1945,2020-04-19 21:02:31,g4ezn2,"Just edited it sorry about that, trades are at the bottom now"
1946,2020-04-19 21:27:48,g4ezn2,"Ya I wanted to mix it up a bit, I also think they stay put"
1947,2020-04-19 22:09:58,g4ezn2,I would be pretty happy if we came out of this with Lamb and Tyler Johnson.
1948,2020-04-19 22:04:17,g4ezn2,I think CeeDee Lamb has the potential to be a stud for y’all so I think the trade works out in the end
1949,2020-04-20 00:00:15,g4ezn2,That’s because it’s a great deal for you and a shit deal for the Steelers lol
1950,2020-04-19 20:46:25,g4ezn2,"I am indeed, tried to make the draft realistic"
1951,2020-04-20 05:23:04,g4ezn2,"IDL or IOL, I would be fine with a defensive lineman like Gallimore, a guard like Ruiz or even a WR like Pittman. The one thing we surely don't need is safety help even if safety is best player available."
1952,2020-04-20 02:04:11,g4ezn2,"Let alone we selected Kinlaw at 19. Look I love Kinlaw, my favorite prospect in the class to watch, but we do not need DT that badly right now. We have a million on roster including three good ones in Hurst, Hankins, and Maliek Collins. PJ Hall is looking like one of the best #4 DTs in the league given how the depth at that position is."
1953,2020-04-19 21:50:24,g4ezn2,This isn’t what I would do but the Raiders make some odd picks
1954,2020-04-19 21:28:31,g4ezn2,"Thank you, I think I was just trying to replace the production of Harris with 2 guys"
1955,2020-04-20 02:46:57,g4ezn2,"Ya I wanted to mix it up and have the Jets grab the tackle they want instead of waiting to see who is left, and thank you"

1957,2020-04-20 02:57:50,g4ezn2,"Dear god please this, of course I don’t want to trade a future 1st but I think Lamb is worth it. I also love every other pick, Malik Harrison fills our 2nd biggest need at LB, then Kenny  Robinson and Willekes in the 4th are steals, Tyler Johnson as well. I like the OG pick and Eagles expresses interest in Cole McDonald so I’m fine with spending a 6th on him. This is basically my ideal draft."
1958,2020-04-19 22:14:04,g4ezn2,"They got Jonathan Greenard in the 3rd, and any player drafted past round 5 is an upside pick and isn’t guaranteed a spot on the roster, I think Brooks is a good young player to help the defense."
1959,2020-04-19 22:55:00,g4ezn2,That’s fair
1960,2020-04-19 23:49:00,g4ezn2,I understand reading probably isn’t your strong suit but I drafted y’all 2 WR’s and a safety in the 3rd not 3 WR’s
1961,2020-04-19 21:39:15,g4ezn2,Yeah this was a miss in my eyes. Claypool is ok but yeah.
1962,2020-04-19 21:03:32,g4ezn2,Ya sorry about that I just added the trade details at the bottom
1963,2020-04-19 23:22:46,g4ezn2,"The trade of three picks (including a 2021 pick) to move up to get Hurts is even worse. In this iteration the Steelers would come out of the 2020 draft with 4 players, which is crazy."
1964,2020-04-19 21:06:55,g4ezn2,"Well I had them trading their 1 and 3 this year and I don’t see a team willing to give up their first 3 picks in 1 draft for 1 guy, plus the value doesn’t add up for the Browns in that scenario"
1965,2020-04-19 21:00:23,g4ezn2,It shouldn’t take you 5 minutes to scroll not my fault
1966,2020-04-19 21:16:00,g4ezn2,Ya I had the hardest time figuring out who traded what for what until I saw his edit
1967,2020-04-19 22:18:16,g4ezn2,"I think those two could really help Wentz in the long run, and they could grow into a nice 1/2 punch"
1968,2020-04-19 20:46:55,g4ezn2,I would be very happy with this outcome kudos to you
1969,2020-04-20 05:36:42,g4ezn2,I also am not a fan off her Eason pick even though it’s good value. If the team didn’t have to win this year fine he could be a good developmental QB for ya but with the team in win now mode that pick needs to be used on a day one starter
1970,2020-04-19 23:06:53,g4ezn2,"They made 1, which in hindsight was obvious as Mayock had said on record before he became a GM that, if he did ever become a GM, he would want his first pick to be the highest character possible to lead the franchise. The rest of his picks were very obvious and good value (especially after round 1).

If you think Mayock is completely incompetent then I guess this draft makes sense, but otherwise this is the worst draft I've seen for the Raiders.

Not selecting a WR in the 1st would be crazy, but trading back so that they have 4 3rd round picks, but not using that capital to trade up into the late 1st or 2nd for the WR1 we desperately need would be insane. Our offense is dependent upon Peoples-Jones here! That's crazy.

There are more crazy picks, but if you did them intentionally because you think Mayock is a moron then I guess there isn't much point in going through them."
1971,2020-04-20 00:59:35,g4ezn2,therefore they would take garbage returns on multiple trades? 0% chance the falcons get to 12 for just a 3rd rounder. also I don’t think either DPJ or Lynn Bowden is going as high as they do here. these picks are left field just for the sake of ‘the raiders do weird stuff’
1972,2020-04-20 03:08:36,g4ezn2,It’s Ironic because I’m a Cowboys fan and I gave y’all one of the best drafts lol
1973,2020-04-19 22:57:32,g4ezn2,I would especially be contemplating the trade back route. as they go from 50 to 163 without a selection.
1974,2020-04-19 21:55:00,g4ezn2,"Like Baun and Claypool, not a fan of Moss or Fromm in the 3rd though. Would have preferred Kareem or Fotu in those spots to help in the defensive side and wait on a TE like Asiasi or Keene"
1975,2020-04-19 21:12:53,g4ezn2,"Fair enough. I agree the won't trade their first three picks. I could see something like 2020 1, 2, 4 and a 2021 3. Just have a hard time seeing them give up a future 1. Thanks for the response and good work with the mock overall. 7 rounds is no joke"
1976,2020-04-19 21:12:39,g4ezn2,Lmao now you put all the trades at the bottom. Would you look at that? People on mobile can see where picks are finally! How tf was I supposed to know that a team traded for a player?
1977,2020-04-19 21:02:59,g4ezn2,Thank you it took a long time
1978,2020-04-19 21:26:59,g4ezn2,"I appreciate it, takes a good amount of time"
1979,2020-04-19 20:34:19,g4ew4j,"...As I lay on the cold ground, bleeding, I knew that I was experiencing my final moments. ""My final message..."" I desperately called out.

Shame about Charles James Fox. I found him quite memorable in the Madness of King George. 

It seemed in the 18th century that the opposition usually allied themselves with the heir to the throne in the hope of gaining power in the next reign. Presumably this was helped by the Hanoverian monarchs having famously bad relationships with their heirs as well."

And short stories give you a feel for the author’s writing style, so often you can get a hint if you would like their other works. A lot of these are from the 40-70s when there were weekly or monthly magazines publishing sci-fi or fantasy or what Harlan Ellison called speculative fiction. A lot of it was mediocre to fair, but some of it was wonderful, ground-breaking work. And a small amount of it could/should be recognized as great literature, but isn’t because it is genre fiction and was published in ‘pulp’ magazines."

2060,2020-04-18 20:17:10,g3shuo,I have a feeling Gute is gonna throw a total curve ball in this draft. Anything but an early round QB please
2061,2020-04-18 19:01:49,g3shuo,"Awesome work. 

They really evaluated a ton of CBs. I have a strong feeling we may pick one with our first three picks."
2062,2020-04-18 19:47:06,g3shuo,"From what I've been reading the last couple days, I wouldn't be upset if the Packers grab McTelvin Agim in the 3rd. Seems like he's a guy that will go a lot higher than people think"
2063,2020-04-18 23:52:35,g3shuo,"Does anybody else find it strange that we only interviewed 2 TEs and 3 OTs, but we interviewed 6 S's? Looking at the QBs we brought in, most of them are guys that would be difficult to scout. They either didn't play much, are versatile and could play other positions or they are from small schools. It seems more like putting the work in to gather information rather than showing actual interest. I do think many of these QBs fit us, though.

The biggest thing I get from this is that ILB in Round 1 is a major consideration. They brought in Baun, Queen and Murray, all of who could be there and fill that ILB need (Baun is a bit of a hybrid). I wonder if they will bring in some of the Day 2 guys like the Akeem Davis-Gaither or Logan Wilson."
2064,2020-04-18 21:09:56,g3shuo,"Great job! Love this content. If it's not too much work, would you mind telling me/linking your sources?"

I'm gonna be so depressed come September"
2066,2020-04-19 13:55:23,g3shuo,"Give me Patrick Queen, a D lineman and a WR and i’m a happy man."
2067,2020-04-20 15:07:41,g3shuo,"This is great OP! Thanks for putting this together.

I think CB/hybrid safety is much higher need than most people on this sub would like to admit. Outside of Jaire, we don't have much consistency or depth here. Sure Kevin King had a half decent season last year, but can he stay consistent and healthy moving forward? Do we renew his cotract after next year? Tramon is probably not back  and so that really leaves us needing one or maybe more. I've got high hopes for Chandon Sullivan, but I don't see him being more than a solid depth piece at this point. 

I'd love K'von Wallace in the third or fourth round if we can grab him there. Also, wouldn't be surprised if we picked CB at 30 if either Gladney or Fulton were available, or a trade back to grab another 2nd rounder, unless one of their preferred OT/WR guys falls to 30."
2068,2020-04-20 21:24:55,g3shuo,"It would be almost criminal if we don’t even consider KJ Hamler. That kid is the biggest playmaker in terms of pure twitchiness in this WR class. I think he would be a perfect addition to this WR core. Not like the others are bad picks, but man, Hamler’s for real. He was able to go off even with a subpar QB."
2069,2020-04-21 21:18:48,g3shuo,"Thanks for the down votes... I am well aware they are not the same kind of player, but this is exactly the reason Metcalf fell in the first place according to several teams."
2070,2020-04-18 19:08:56,g3shuo,They should have met with Chase Claypool
2071,2020-04-18 21:24:32,g3shuo,We also met last season with Manny Wilkins (udfa) and Ka'Dar Hollman (6th round pick).
2072,2020-04-18 20:55:07,g3shuo,">Kameron Cline has like no info. I saw him listed anywhere from 270-295lbs and DT to EDGE.

Cline played at 275 in college, lining up at multiple positions along the DL similar to Kingsley Keke at TX A&M. He has since bulked up to 295 during the off season to embrace his DT role. He's a run stopper mostly with room to grow as a pass rusher."
2073,2020-04-19 01:49:36,g3shuo,I hope we don’t take a DB high. Even if we lose Kevin King in free agency or don’t think he’s good enough we have Chandon Sullivan and maybe josh Jackson could develop
2074,2020-04-19 04:05:52,g3shuo,Another 1st round DB... uhg
2075,2020-04-19 14:21:52,g3shuo,It’s going to be a DL
2076,2020-04-19 01:51:01,g3shuo,"I hope they don’t, we have jaire Alexander and Chandon Sullivan! Then again depth at corner is never a bad thing and King could definitely leave in FA"
2077,2020-04-19 06:41:00,g3shuo,"Reggie Robinson is a guy I’m keeping an eye on, he fits what Gute seems to like, looks to have a decent ceiling as an outside corner if he can sit for a season (like, say, while Kevin King finishes out his deal) so he can continue working on things and seems like an early day 3 type of guy they could position themselves to grab easily enough."
2078,2020-04-18 20:41:06,g3shuo,"I agree with that. I also don't think Javelin Guidry or Bravvion Roy are there as late as this list projects, but I'd be stoked to have either one really anytime on day 3."
2079,2020-04-19 01:57:01,g3shuo,I'd be very surprised if either Queen or Murray make it to 30
2080,2020-04-19 02:20:21,g3shuo,"I dunno that I’d read too far into the higher end guys GB brings in. Historically that’s almost always just been due diligence on their part and I don’t remember the last time they took a guy in the first or second they actually met with ahead of time. The real guys to watch are the day 3 prospects they met with, because they have brought in 12 or so of those guys they’ve met with in the past 2 years, and regularly did so as well under Thompson as well. Top 64 they seem to play a lot closer to their vest."
2081,2020-04-18 21:22:52,g3shuo,[deleted]
2082,2020-04-18 20:36:06,g3shuo,"I watched a few of his games and honestly don't see the hype with him. Maybe they were the wrong games, but he just seems like a height/weight/straight line speed guy without much nuance to back it up."
2083,2020-04-18 21:37:18,g3shuo,[deleted]
2084,2020-04-19 03:41:21,g3shuo,"He weighed in at barely over 280. Not ""official"" but it means he's bulking up. He played across the defensive line in college, but almost exclusively inside his senior year. I went back and watched his tape vs. NDSU and vs. SDSU. He played a lot as a 3 tech (between guard and tackle) on run downs, but ran stunts with the edge guy so he would end up in outside contain. Lined up equally as a nose (over the center) and 3 tech on pass downs. He projects as a pass rushing 3-4 defensive end.

With limited tape, he's hard to pass hard judgement on. From what I can gather, he started an edge rusher as a freshman and progressively shifted more inside throughout his career. As a high school basketball player/tight end, he has long arms which he uses to beat the punch of offensive linemen. This, in tandem with his good get off and size advantage over FCS competition, allowed him to be a quality power rusher with historic production at South Dakota. His pass rush skillset is limited to a bull rush, and occasional swim moves. As a run defender, he's pretty lacking. He only has limited ability to disrupt rushing lanes, gets crowded out too easily, and isn't always disciplined with his assignment.

Probably a priority free agent practice squad guy that may have some upside with good coaching."
2085,2020-04-19 02:15:35,g3shuo,"Sullivan is an UDFA and while he played solid in the small amount he played that’s hardly a guarantee to continue, and they consider both him and Jackson nickel/slot corners, where as Kevin King mans the outside."
2086,2020-04-19 14:33:32,g3shuo,"Don’t forget Tramon hasn’t been re-signed yet either. With King coming up on free agency, CB could be a big need sooner rather than later."
2087,2020-04-18 20:53:18,g3shuo,[deleted]
2088,2020-04-19 04:57:00,g3shuo,"I don't think that really explains someone like Murray, though. It's well-known that he has great character and all of that. They are also visiting with EVERY Round 1 ILB outside of Isaiah Simmons. That's another sign. If you are just doing due diligence than why would you visit every Round 1 guy at the position? That's unique from the other positions. A lot of times you won't get guys you are interested in and visited with just because teams take them above you, so you have to be careful drawing too much from past picks."
2089,2020-04-19 00:41:20,g3shuo,"If you have Twitter, you should follow @JustinM_NFL. He has been posting updates regarding prospect visits constantly.

He just announced the Packers visited with [Charlie Taumoepeau (TE/FB - Portland St)](https://twitter.com/JustinM_NFL/status/1251639734356578306?s=19). I notice that all the news he reports is then recorded on other sites like the ones you mentioned."
2090,2020-04-18 20:54:40,g3shuo,Totally agree. People talk about moving him to TE too. These guys never seem to make an impact.
2091,2020-04-19 05:00:49,g3shuo,Isnt that what people said about Metcalf 12 months ago?
2092,2020-04-18 22:03:11,g3shuo,I think in 2018 there were like 7-8 guys we met with that ended up on the team at some point too.  I'd say there's a pretty good chance we see some of the guys on this list in green and gold.
2093,2020-04-19 02:20:51,g3shuo,"True that Alexander and Jackson are probably better suited in the slot. I think you’re sleeping on Sullivan a bit though. The fact that he was a UDFA is irrelevant when we saw him play very well last year. But yeah if we’re not keeping King it wouldn’t be *bad* to get an outside corner 

https://www.reddit.com/r/GreenBayPackers/comments/epdy90/chandon_sullivan_quietly_had_a_terrific_season/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf"
2094,2020-04-18 21:09:42,g3shuo,"Yeah that's fair, and obviously the draft media is wrong about plenty of guys each year, so updated or not, some are bound to be way off."
2095,2020-04-19 06:23:57,g3shuo,"Um, last year they met with 5 of the top 6 drafted OTs and ended up not even drafting an OT. There’s any number of reasons they decide to meet with a guy, it doesn’t necessarily mean a whole heck of a lot in the grand scheme of things with this FO. Gutekunst has told reporters in the past he does meetings to check medicals and to throw some deception out there, so if the GM himself is admitting to it potentially not meaning anything we shouldn’t be trying to draw real meaning from it."
2096,2020-04-18 22:26:04,g3shuo,You'll eat those words
2097,2020-04-19 06:35:53,g3shuo,Metcalf showed a lot more dominance at those traits in his film than Claypool. There’s been a lot of talk about moving Claypool to TE to get him more favorable coverage matchups because Claypool isn’t good at getting separation despite his athleticism. He’s basically Allen Lazard but better at the underwear Olympics. Metcalf was considered potentially limited in his routes but he could wreck people with the route he did know.
2098,2020-04-18 22:12:20,g3shuo,[deleted]
2099,2020-04-19 06:11:09,g3shuo,"It’s not really a matter of sleeping on him, I stumped hard for him in preseason last year telling everyone who’d listen that he should make the team, it’s more acknowledging that while he did play well he only played a third of the snaps he could have played and was hot garbage the prior year (which is why we got him as a FA). You don’t generally call a position “good” because you got a guy gave you good play there for essentially a third of a season. Corner is such a volatile situation that you want more than a 350 snap sample size to be basing your future plans on."
2100,2020-04-19 14:25:21,g3shuo,[That’s a W](https://youtu.be/2L2p9fldkZ0)
2101,2020-04-19 11:56:42,g3shuo,"Yeah, and the routes he did know happened to be ones that the Seahawks feature very prominently in their offense, so his learning curve there was less than it would've been just about anywhere else."
2102,2020-04-18 22:26:03,g3shuo,"That's true of basically every team considering most only get one or two chances to get ""top tier"" guys and a good portion of those bust too.  We did meet with a lot more early round prospects this year than normal though."
2103,2020-04-19 13:52:10,g3shuo,True I’m just a Chandon Sullivan Stan lol
2104,2020-04-19 13:33:54,g3shuo,The routes he did run in college were so basic that pretty much every offense incorporates them in some way. Ole Miss’s offensive scheme was incredibly basic in that regard. The reason Metcalf dropped was 100% his medicals.
2105,2020-04-19 14:01:05,g3shuo,"Which is fair. Corner is also a position though where you’re never truly “set” since no other position can suffer drop off as quickly without warning. I’d much rather be in the position where Sullivan is our dime corner and playing a lot of special teams with the possibility of earning more snaps if he continues to play well rather than just handing him the nickel job. If he earns it, great, but I would want a more solid plan than letting him and Josh Jackson fight it out."

I was joking around on a discord server when some kids were talking about what there pfp looked like. I wanted to join in and said to a guy who looked a little like James Charles that he looked like him.
He immediately got really offended and everyone said to apologise since it was an insult, didn't know that it was that bad. 
I apologised it the end, being the nice person I am. 
Am I the one in the wrong?

2113,2020-04-18 13:36:20,g3nfw6,NTA If they find it insulting it’s because they’re homophobic or something similar. It sounds like a compliment to me.
2114,2020-04-18 13:53:42,g3nfw6,NTA. People look like people sometimes.
2115,2020-04-18 20:34:36,g3nfw6,yta for wasting our time with this question but nta for the situation
2116,2020-04-18 14:17:01,g3nfw6,"What? The commenters here are crazy. You told someone, “You look like this guy who plucks his eyebrows to look like Bette Davis and wears lipstick, rouge, and eyeshadow.” Now you’re asking if it was offensive. Ya think? YTA"
2117,2020-04-18 15:05:04,g3nfw6,Yeah I doubt this was about the previous “”scandals”” (no idea what) JC was involved in lol
2118,2020-04-18 14:25:12,g3nfw6,A gay guy that's so attractive tinder won't let him have a profile Because they think he's fake. If your only comparing looks thats kinda of a huge compliment.
2119,2020-04-18 14:26:16,g3nfw6,"Seconded. He's way too controversial a figure. It's it was someone with generally positive or minimal press, people assuming its just the looks would be standard.

With him, well..."
2120,2020-04-18 14:01:14,g3nfw6,I second this lol..
2121,2020-04-18 16:58:08,g3nfw6,"it doesn't matter if he's controversial about things he does

Why???

They were talking about pfps so it was all about looks"
2122,2020-04-18 14:25:58,g3nfw6,He's a beauty guru from YouTube. He's known for artistic makeup skills and a lot of scandals.
2123,2020-04-18 23:45:57,g3nfw6,"It does. If I told someone they kinda look like Ivanka Trump, more than a fair share of people would be mad, even if she is pretty. People aren't one variable and any comparison to a controversial figure will invite assumptions about other comparable attributes. It's how people work."

2131,2020-05-03 15:22:52,gcroxn,How does the list work? Seems weird that tarkovsky with basically a flawless filmography and no films under 8.1 isn't there while michael bay makes it with pearl harbor lol.
2132,2020-05-03 14:56:05,gcroxn,So 109 of the movies in the list are from the 24 same directors?
2133,2020-05-03 16:10:52,gcroxn,David Fincher only 3 !!!! Wow that’s surprising !?!
2134,2020-05-03 17:45:34,gcroxn,"James Cameron should have 4 films, where is Titanic?"
2135,2020-05-03 18:47:58,gcroxn,The Hobbit trilogy over original LOTR?! This is a joke. The fact that THERE EVEN WAS 3 hobbit films instead of two is a joke in itself. Frigg off Lahey
2136,2020-05-03 14:51:12,gcroxn,Really interesting. I wonder how the different directors would rank under their average IMDB score across their entire careers.
2137,2020-05-03 16:11:15,gcroxn,I really hope you meant Lotr and not the hobbit???

Yeah guys. This is a shitpost. Move along."
2142,2020-05-03 15:10:53,gcroxn,IMDb isn't an accurate measurement of the quality of the film. Sight and Sound polls are better.
2143,2020-05-03 15:44:00,gcroxn,"Honestly, this is a really good starting point for getting into great directors. The movies listed here are all mostly good of course, but they all have great movies missing as well that you can dig into.

I quite like this list of 250 directors from [TheyShootPictures](http://www.theyshootpictures.com/gf1000_top250directors.htm). That list works by ranking the directors according to their films placements on all-time greatest lists. For more recent, this is the [Top 100](http://www.theyshootpictures.com/21stcentury_top100directors.htm) of the 21st Century."
2144,2020-05-03 18:26:24,gcroxn,I'm really surprised Paul Thomas Anderson isn't in the top 20
2145,2020-05-03 18:13:02,gcroxn,"No Fellini, no Bunuel, no Truffaut, no Fassbinder, no John Ford, but you have Michael Bay"
2146,2020-05-03 15:57:51,gcroxn,Pearl Harbour is also crap.
2147,2020-05-03 15:30:42,gcroxn,"Age of Extinction is truly the best of his transformers. I havent seen the knight one but as far as being knowingly ridiculous nothing tops it. Dinosaur robots, Mark Whalberg killing a man by pushing him out the window by throwing an American football (that was inexplicably in an apartment in china) at him, the scene where the bud light truck crashes and Mark picks one off the ground, pops the top off on his car then takes a swig with the label towards the camera. It's all just so much its perfect."
2148,2020-05-03 15:45:10,gcroxn,Michael Bay shouldn’t be allowed anything but the razzies
2149,2020-05-03 17:01:42,gcroxn,"Yeah, I'm not sure where OP got this from. Transformers: Age of Extinction is currently at 5.6/10. Probably OP trying to make a joke, but in the process, they're undermining their whole post."
2150,2020-05-03 16:10:39,gcroxn,OP is *trying* to be funny.
2151,2020-05-03 15:47:15,gcroxn,"OP is definitely incorrect in this post. Just [double checked](https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/?ref_=nv_mv_250) as well, none of those Michael Bay movies are in it. Also, it's the LotR trilogy (seriously how do you mess this up, it's films #7, 10, 15 on the list) that's on the list for Peter Jackson and not the Hobbit trilogy as this posts suggests."
2152,2020-05-03 15:34:14,gcroxn,Yes. The sequels to the hobbit aka Lotr
2153,2020-05-03 15:46:32,gcroxn,Yep that's what caught my eye.  What the hell
2154,2020-05-03 17:30:55,gcroxn,"It's now trilogy, this is bretty gud"
2155,2020-05-03 17:26:14,gcroxn,"It was a joke, same as ""the hobbit sequels"""
2156,2020-05-03 16:30:57,gcroxn,I'm wondering if it's some blend of profit and rating (critic or popular?)
2157,2020-05-03 15:27:16,gcroxn,I think you need a certain number of votes to be included into the list.
2158,2020-05-03 15:52:49,gcroxn,"It's not necessarily a list of critical hits, it's a list of popular films."
2159,2020-05-03 18:11:02,gcroxn,There are several directors included as a joke
2160,2020-05-03 17:23:16,gcroxn,Perfect filmography with exception of his debut.

2162,2020-05-03 18:52:35,gcroxn,No Michael bay either that's just false
2163,2020-05-03 16:04:18,gcroxn,also I don't think I've ever seen it but I doubt BB2 is top 250 material
2164,2020-05-03 15:49:32,gcroxn,Bumblebee is the best followed by the first. The rest are bad.
2165,2020-05-03 16:16:25,gcroxn,The Rock says otherwise.
2166,2020-05-03 16:28:12,gcroxn,"I guess so. But Transformers actually was in the top 250 back in 2007, so guess the truth is funnier than fiction."
2167,2020-05-03 19:41:20,gcroxn,"There's not really much to discuss here (besides the biases of the IMDB user-base), might as well try to inject some humour... I guess?

Also no one's mentioned Scorsese's *The Room* yet... I suppose it replaced Wolf of Wall Street so his total is still correct."
2168,2020-05-03 15:51:53,gcroxn,"OP's post says the Hobbit Sequels, which are LOTR. I think he's just making a joke."
2169,2020-05-03 15:51:54,gcroxn,"OP said “The Hobbit sequels”, which *is* the LotR trilogy"
2170,2020-05-03 15:51:24,gcroxn,"Just tell op you found a correction, no need to call them out and make a minor stink ... :)"
2171,2020-05-03 15:53:56,gcroxn,"If that's what was intended, it strikes me as odd that they weren't listed out individually by title and year, and that they were referred to as the sequels to The Hobbit. I know that's true with the books, but when referencing the films I don't know many people who would ever refer to them like that."
2172,2020-05-03 18:05:22,gcroxn,"There is also things such as recency bias coming into play, really well liked and massively popular movies that came out after IMDB became a thing are more likely to hit the top 250 than some beloved art house classic"
2173,2020-05-03 18:33:01,gcroxn,"Isn’t that alien 3 if I’m not mistaken. Yeah I watched it for the first time recently , really not good. Didn’t feel like a Fincher film really ?!?

What’s your best film of his ??? It’s either Zodiac or Girl with the Dragon Tattoo for me?!?"
2174,2020-05-03 19:32:18,gcroxn,"Panic Room, Benjamin Button, The Game and Gone Girl all keep him from having perfect “filmography”. Add Alien 3 on top and his odd decision to do a remake of Girl with dragon tattoo (which was fine but pretty average) I’d say he’s more and more looking like a bit or miss director for me. I absolutely *love* Zodiac and Social Network, but his other movies don’t really come close if we’re being honest."
2175,2020-05-03 18:10:34,gcroxn,Panic Room was pretty lackluster as well
2176,2020-05-04 06:46:58,gcroxn,Because it's better than Pearl Harbor ?
2177,2020-05-03 15:55:38,gcroxn,Bumblebee isn't Bay's movie though
2178,2020-05-03 17:44:09,gcroxn,Sorkin and Tarantino as fixers on that script did a ton. I've always wondered if that wouldn't have been a 9/10 instead of a super fun 7 if they'd have had Tony Scott directing.
2179,2020-05-03 18:02:42,gcroxn,How did that happen?
2180,2020-05-03 18:03:42,gcroxn,"It says ""The Hobbit trilogy"" now"
2181,2020-05-03 16:07:32,gcroxn,"Yes, chronologically the Hobbit takes place before the LotR. However, I can't think of anyone that refers to LotR as the 'Hobbit Sequel', or anywhere I've ever seen it published as such. If anything you see The Hobbit as the LotR prequel. Sure, that's all anecdotal, but you also see it's the only post OP doesn't list the individual films or years.

It's much more reasonable to assume OP meant the Hobbit trilogy when saying 'Hobbit sequel', which was a release date sequel to the LotR trilogy.

Or, it could be OP was making a joke as someone else said, but the entirety of OP's post here is serious in tone so if it's a joke i'm not seeing it. I could just be the dumb."
2182,2020-05-03 18:37:22,gcroxn,Predictable answer but Fight Club for me.
2183,2020-05-03 20:21:06,gcroxn,"Gone Girl? One of his most acclaimed movies? 
Had Benjamin Button came out in the previous century, it would be a classic today. 
Panic Room is a great home invasion thriller. 
Dragon Tattoo is an unnecessary remake that brought nothing new to the table. But it's not a bad movie in itself. 

I have not seen The Game."
2184,2020-05-03 18:15:22,gcroxn,It might not have the depth of his other movies but it still very entertaining.
2185,2020-05-03 17:46:48,gcroxn,Wish he was still around. Tony made some great films.
2186,2020-05-04 12:20:09,gcroxn,There were fewer films back then. /s
2187,2020-05-03 17:27:26,gcroxn,It’s a joke.
2188,2020-05-03 18:57:20,gcroxn,"Ah sadly Fight Club doesn’t hit me the same way as most people , I knew the twist/ending before I saw the film. Completely ruined my experience, it’s still good though don’t get me wrong."
2189,2020-05-03 19:33:23,gcroxn,It’s a completely forgettable movie.
2190,2020-05-03 17:49:13,gcroxn,The two saddest pop culture losses for me are him and Chester.
2191,2020-05-03 17:58:47,gcroxn,"Just a heads up, OP has now edited it to say 'Hobbit trilogy', not even 'Hobbit sequel' anymore. Doesn't seem like a joke."
2192,2020-05-03 18:28:00,gcroxn,They made their own decisions. Not very wise ones.
2193,2020-05-03 18:19:09,gcroxn,Wtf? I think OP might have brain damage.
2194,2020-05-03 20:47:28,gcroxn,Mental illness isn't a decision.

2231,2020-05-03 17:06:15,gcpr4h,This would probably be a really great game to watch minus the fact the final would probably be like 14-10

Mine: Bucs win 14-6"
2234,2020-05-03 16:49:56,gcpr4h,"With such dominate defenses and meh offenses, special teams wins this one...  
Devin Hester (return TD) and a late Robbie Gould FG help the Bears edge the Bucs in a game with no offensive touchdowns, 10-9."
2235,2020-05-03 18:55:57,gcpr4h,"Would you consider adding special teams? K, P, KR/PR?

Adding in Devin Hester here could legitimately be a deciding factor for some."
2236,2020-05-03 15:09:45,gcpr4h,I would personally sub out Martellus Bennett for either Greg Olson or Desmond Clark. Bears and Bucs both have great defenses. I think the WR and OL groups are equal as well (People underrate Marty Booker). I  think the difference here is that the Bears have a better QB-RB duo than the Bucs. Bears would win 20-17
2237,2020-05-03 13:12:00,gcpr4h,"Kind of similar teams actually, absolutely stacked front 7’s with mediocre quarterbacks, I think Matt Forte would be the big difference maker in the game"

2241,2020-05-03 18:56:05,gcpr4h,Bucs 16-10
2242,2020-05-03 12:31:59,gcpr4h,Bears. Hands down
2243,2020-05-03 12:38:55,gcpr4h,It’s the bucs imo they’ve got such a good defense and the Oline is amazing and Johnson was pretty solid during the time they were playoff contenders
2244,2020-05-03 16:37:22,gcpr4h,"Bears defense here is better idk what y’all are on, easy scrubbing."
2245,2020-05-03 14:58:27,gcpr4h,The 02 Bucs alone could beat a Bears 21st century all star team.
2246,2020-05-03 12:31:12,gcpr4h,Cutler and Bmarsh 1 more time!!!!
2247,2020-05-03 21:48:33,gcpr4h,[deleted]
2248,2020-05-10 17:29:34,gcpr4h,The bears 2013 was the #2 highest scoring offense in the NFL and people are saying that their O is bad?
2249,2020-05-03 12:36:48,gcpr4h,You should swap the second Derrick Brooks for Lavonte David in the LB section for the bucs
2250,2020-05-03 19:43:28,gcpr4h,How dare you leave out the Bucs kicking advantage with Automatica Gramatica
2251,2020-05-03 20:46:18,gcpr4h,Without Hester and Gould I'd say the bucs but that bears special teams has me on the fence
2252,2020-05-03 15:26:13,gcpr4h,Were talking about a better version of arguably the GOAT passing defence going up against a QB who lead the league twice in interceptions.
2253,2020-05-03 16:35:31,gcpr4h,"Who even is brad Johnson.

Bears 49-3"
2254,2020-05-04 13:50:27,gcpr4h,That’s not even true
2255,2020-05-03 21:50:49,gcpr4h,Apparently no one read the rules that special teams are considered equal
2256,2020-05-03 12:40:38,gcpr4h,Woops that's what I meant. Thanks for pointing it out!
2257,2020-05-03 22:00:12,gcpr4h,"Special teams doesn't apply

Read the rules"
2258,2020-05-03 21:43:02,gcpr4h,Exactly!
2259,2020-05-03 15:42:34,gcpr4h,"Brad Johnson had some pretty bad int seasons too, he had 3 seasons where he had +5% Int%, Cutler never hit 5%"
2260,2020-05-07 15:45:15,gcpr4h,Hes a super bowl champion in the last 30 years.
2261,2020-05-03 13:00:15,gcpr4h,So what are you gonna do about Manning? I firmly believe he's a Colt but he's been the best QB the broncos have had as well.
2262,2020-05-03 22:01:02,gcpr4h,I meant in reference to the guy above who said special teams would be the difference maker. That if you were to include kickers then the Bucs have a great option with gramatica as well
2263,2020-05-03 15:48:44,gcpr4h,Brad Johnsons best season he went 22 TD (4.9%) to 6 INTS (1.3%). And his career INT percentage with the bucs is 2.4% (.1% higher than Cutlers lowest INT season). Cutler has literally never had a season that good. Doug Martins best season is also comparable to Fortes best season.
2264,2020-05-03 16:55:26,gcpr4h,"Yeah there's probably several players like that. Revis, Sherman, maybe Anquan Boldin just off the top of my head."
2265,2020-05-03 18:22:35,gcpr4h,He can represent both. I mentioned in the rules that if a player qualifies for multiple teams assume there is a clone.
2266,2020-05-03 15:53:13,gcpr4h,"You are acting like Brad Johnson was some god of taking care of the ball, he was not. He threw marginally fewer picks and nowhere near the ypg or TD that Jay threw

Edit: Both times Jay led the league in INTs, he was still a much lower int% than Brad Johnson's worst seasons"
2267,2020-05-04 02:40:56,gcpr4h,"What OP did for Sherman is probably what he’s going to do for Manning. The Colts get his best year with them, and the Broncos would get 2013 Manning. Just as the Seahawks got 2013 Sherman, and the 49ers got 2019 Sherman"
2268,2020-05-03 15:56:08,gcpr4h,"Im acting like in Johnsons best season he was a god at taking care of the ball, because he absolutely was. 1.3% percentage INT rate was ridiculously low for a starting QB in 2002. Johnson really only had turnover issues during his stints with other teams.

Johnsons worst seasons he wasnt even on the bucs lol, why do you keep comparing those to Cutler?

Edit: Johnsons lowest season he threw 6 INTS and 22 TD. Cutlers lowest year was 21 TD and 11 INTS."
2269,2020-05-04 04:56:39,gcpr4h,"Cool, thanks for the info!"
2270,2020-05-03 16:10:31,gcpr4h,You can't just take his best outliers and ignore his worst outliers lol
2271,2020-05-03 16:11:55,gcpr4h,Dude this post is about players in the peaks on that team. Obviously you have to look at their best season on that team. You keep talking about Johnsons bad seasons but they are pretty much all when he was a Viking.
2272,2020-05-03 16:21:36,gcpr4h,He played 3 seasons for TB and then got benched for Chris Simms lol
2273,2020-05-03 16:22:57,gcpr4h,And what does any of that have to do with Johnsons peak of 22 TD to 6 INTs? Were using peaks here dude.
2274,2020-05-03 16:24:18,gcpr4h,"Lol ok man, you're right. Brad Johnson was better than Jay Cutler. You win"

When Jeffree got caught, he took the coward’s way out and didn’t show proof. i still don’t know why people support either of them.

anyway, i might not like James, but i don’t use that as an excuse to bash him. he’s human, just like the rest of us. i would also like to clarify that he also isn’t a representation of all gays, but i thought you would know that since “you have gay friends who don’t act like him.”

Men do not always have to be the bread winners or providers, and women do not always have to be stay at home women (although Islam never said this directly, almost all the text enforces women to be put into very rigid/small/narrow boxes so this is the only option left). These dumb ass roles makes it so when male or female does something outside the dumb rigid role they are looked down upon. 

The roles can SWAP or both men and women can do these things. Also, do not get me started at the one example muslims bring up of one of the prophets wife owned a business and rode a camel alongside the prophet ????? THAT IS A HUMAN RIGHT LMFAO to be able to have a business and do something as basic as riding a camel."

And people have this idea that gay men are all like that. I know a few gay guys and they dont behave like this fool. Being gay doesn't mean pretending to be a woman."

Sexual deviancy like this is tolerated. I mean children look up to this guy. What message are they receiving? It's totally cool for dudes to pretend to be women and vice versa and other sexual innuendos. This behaviour isn't something to be encouraged. These 'harmless' things have a cascading effect. For example, promiscuity is encouraged. It's cool to have multiple sexual partners. Look at the divorce rates in the west, they are through the roof. Children growing up in unstable homes as Mom and Dad cant figure out who does what now that traditional gender roles are considered sexist. All in the name of progression and tolerance whilst ignoring the problems and being unable to deal with the fallout.

Just like when people said and still say, "" Transgenders aren't harming anyone, let them do their thing"". Now we have the transgender movement pushing for trans people in women's sports. There are trans people advocating for children hormone therapy and 'sex change'. And people are just going with it because 'muh prOgREssIoN'.

""It's cool to have multiple partners""


The fuck you talking about? If two person are in a committed relationship it's not cool to have multiple partners. Are you saying the concept of cheating does not exist in the west? Are you retarded or something?"
2333,2020-05-04 02:21:43,gcpecz,"What's wrong with divorce though? You want to force or make 2 people who don't love or respect each other stay together to create even more toxicty and negativity whilst if they separated and moved on it would be better for all. You're confusing a lot of things, correlation doesn't equal causation.

You're also confusing stereotypical gender norms and infusing them with sex when they have no business there. Being feminine or acting feminine doesn't mean you're trying to be a woman or you're trying to change your gender. 

 Makeup doesn't belong to women. James Charles isn't confusing anyone by putting on makeup. Just because he is more feminine doesn't make him any less of a man. He's a man and he's happy with being a man. Him using makeup doesn't change that he's not trans nor is he trying to be a woman. That's idiotic.

Also a free society is great. You and no one else should be telling people what they can and can't do and what they can and cannot be. There's nothing wrong with having multiple partners as long as you practise safe sex. There's nothing wrong with divorce. If people were truly happy with how things were they would continue to be those things."
2334,2020-05-04 03:05:48,gcpecz,"What’s so wrong with divorce? In muslim countries, so many abusive and toxic families exist because the mother and father dislike each other and take their anger out in front of/on the kids. What’s wrong with wanting to be happy and not be stuck in a loveless marriage? It’s not affecting you.

Moreover being transgender/wearing makeup has NOTHING to do with “sexual deviancy”, which isn’t even wrong in the first place. If an adult wants to have sex with multiple other consenting adults, how is it any of your business? It’s not harming anyone."

2352,2020-05-03 17:43:24,gco1lk,"When gay men say they are attracted to straight men I think it’s a few different possibilities: I think one is they are associating certain personality traits and physical traits (typically masculinity) with straight, so they actually mean they like masculinity and the actual sexuality doesn’t have anything to do with the attraction. Second it could be more of a “forbidden fruit” mentality or the idea that they’re somewhat unique for having a straight guy turned on to only women plus them. Third I think it could be more internalized homophobia where they are turned off by gay men and are desiring to be in the “normal” group."
2353,2020-05-03 11:49:18,gco1lk,"Yes, I only find straight men attractive. Gayness is a weird turnoff for me.

I know it’s not supposed to matter, but I can’t even fancy a celeb if I know they are gay. 

When I was thinking I was straight myself, I posted on an app and guys really liked it. They just wanted to hang out and suck me off. 

I think a lot of gay men just want a bro really."
2354,2020-05-03 12:58:06,gco1lk,"> as in “straight acting” guys, that are a bit more chill and “masculine” than the stereotype gay guy.

the vast vast majority of gay men are not the stereotype of gay men or even feminine. so it makes absolutely no sense"

what is that supposed to mean? are you claiming that gay men want some sort of platonic bro and not romantic partners?"
2357,2020-05-03 12:39:06,gco1lk,"No I think gay dating is really hard. It has so many rules and things, it’s confusing. It’s just simpler to date a straight man. No expectations or anything. Some gay men just want to play games and watch tv then suck guys off."
2358,2020-05-03 19:31:12,gco1lk,Shut the fuck up! You argue with everyone.
2359,2020-05-03 13:10:01,gco1lk,Yes. I don’t think a lot of gay men are mature enough to have romantic partners.

2361,2020-05-03 12:53:03,gco1lk,"No but if I say I’m straight, then they don’t expect anything from me. 

And anything we do is more... sexy. 

I don’t know if I crossed a line into a fetish. I just know I was less shamed and I felt more confident identifying as a straight guy in being intimate with a gay man.

I’ve not got to a place where I can do ‘gay dating’ as a ‘gay man’. Or anything."

2365,2020-05-03 09:05:19,gcn5xm,"There is an attempt to ridicule U.S. values. Particularly the 2nd Amendment, which is one of the most righteous things available on planet Earth. The 1st Amendment is similarly vulnerable to NPCs holding their wrists out.

Decentralization is always key. Decentralize everything. The revolution always starts at your home & it’s not what it looks like in the movies. (Remember, that’s one of their propaganda arms.) Revolution doesn’t have to be violent or dramatic. That’s a fear-based trick to make us averse to trying.

The real revolution, the thing that scares the empire the most, is us growing food reasonably, collaborating with neighbors & communities, keeping a close eye on schools, homeschooling, leveling up your skills, making plans that fit the land you live on, generating harmony & a sustainable lifestyle. It’s not commuting for work. It’s learning how to generate wealth & productivity in ways that are meaningful for your locale. Repairing things. Focusing on analog, serviceable machines & technology. Focusing on cultivating healthy wildlife populations in your locale & practicing ethical, sustainable subsistence. It’s preserving food without plastic & excessive refined sugar. It’s rejecting 90% of the products you see in grocery stores—the toxic made-up beauty products that send you & the planet to an early grave. The shitty meat, white powders, pussy milk, genetically modified crops. Those things should be invisible to your path. If we all ignore them they can’t exist.

It’s protecting your children & the children around you so they maintain their innocence, creativity & confidence. Children come to Earth to teach *us* because they are closer to god. It’s backwards right now.

This Thing happening is a stunning opportunity for us to bolster our localities, infiltrate & show up to community council meetings & cover neighborhoods in food. Then start addressing the toxic public education. Redesign your income. Cook most of your meals. Do everything more thoughtfully & with pride. Get books on homesteading, permaculture, natural beauty/personal care products, trail guides, local plant guides, take gun safety classes. You can live anywhere in the U.S. & live a radically atavistic lifestyle & we destroy their tricks to destroy us by disengaging.

The elite want us dumb, lazy & uninspired because they do not want us self-sufficient & living in harmony with nature."
2366,2020-05-03 08:54:27,gcn5xm,I just came across this blog earlier today and I find it really insightful and helpful. Thanks for spreading the word
2367,2020-05-03 09:15:18,gcn5xm,"Though I found this to be one of the most in-depth articles I've read in while on the matter, there are a few reasons why it left me confused and unclear as to whether it is legit. Or better yet, even written by a gatekeeper/shill.

1. The mentioning of Tom Hanks' tweets was unnecessary. Sure, they may be containing some symbolisms, but I don't find them to be a strong enough argument to be mentioned in such a detailed breakdown.
2. No mention whatsoever of Mr Vax himself: Shill Bates. So wait, Forrest Gump receives an honourable mention, but one of the most prominent figures at the heart of this plandemic gets completely left out? (definitely weird)
3. Though I have considered many times that many conspiracies could in fact be placed there as breadcrumbs for the purpose of actually being revealed, I'm not entirely convinced that they ALL are. But who knows, maybe I'm wrong.
4. Some of those possible outcomes suggested sound a lot more like internal intel, more than conclusions put together by an actually curious critical thinker. Though I may just not be as good at maths as the writer is.

To sum up, I really enjoyed the way this article was put together, and gave me a lot of food for thought, but I certainly cannot deny there is a small part of me inside that smells a bit of gatekeeping (particularly the lack of mentions of Shill Bates).  


EDIT: NOT (as good at maths...)"
2368,2020-05-03 11:03:20,gcn5xm,"The fundamental aspect is not ""subverting institutions.""  That's just a side-effect.  The article mentions the real agenda:  blame shifting.  Whether natural or manufactured, COVID-19 makes a great scapegoat."
2369,2020-05-09 14:57:18,gcn5xm,"Thank you for sharing, this is the first piece i've read that makes sense of a lot of mysterious, insane and illogical happenings over the past few years and more. I'm looking to spread the word but it's going to be very slow going and not easy."
2370,2020-05-03 12:28:04,gcn5xm,Great perspective and practical solutions! Let me know if you need any support! Thanks for sharing!
2371,2020-05-03 10:05:18,gcn5xm,Also no mention of Q. Either doesn't know..  or doesn't know enough to discredit.
2372,2020-05-03 12:04:02,gcn5xm,"Especially because the main point of the article is ""don't fight back, that's what they want you to do"""
2373,2020-05-03 10:08:06,gcn5xm,"Though I have my own doubts about Q's true nature, that's a valid point."
2374,2020-05-03 12:37:26,gcn5xm,"Yeah, that too. Wasn't too sure what to make of it. On one hand, it seems obvious that they want to provoke people to revolt, possibly for a higher purpose. On the other hand, I'm sure nobody wants a global revolution. So  it sort of caught me off guard. 

Thing is, a lot of sheeple and/or NPCs get criticized of cognitive dissonance, forgetting though that the same could apply to critical thinkers, to the point where they are so far down the rabbit hole that anything that makes them question their own theories might get called out as gatekeeping or shillish. So I certainly try to be open minded enough to make space for anything that contradicts my own reality and beliefs.

But this article certainly has some weirdness about it."
2375,2020-05-05 01:13:45,gclb94,"No, he's doing this because Dahvie Vanity, someone he toured with when he was a singer, has been trying to make a comeback. Years ago, he called out Dahvie for abusing underage girls but then retracted his statement, rubbing elbows and touring with him not long after. 

Now that Dahvie is back in the spotlight people are angry that Jeffree was complicit in the abuse and has been alleged to have been a witness, so he's trying to deflect and focus on some other drama, because the Dahvie accusations are legitimate and serious while his stuff with James is petty."
2376,2020-05-03 13:29:52,gclb94,I'm a huge jeffree fan  aswell but I cant shake the feeling that maybe starting the drama up again has something to do with instant influencer and the lime light being on James for something positive 🤔🤔🤔
2377,2020-05-05 12:24:27,gclb94,"Here is my conspiraspeculation about what happened...


1. I think Nathan had some kind of issue with James that he made Jeffree aware of...I don’t know WHAT but something. Maybe James hit on his brother, or looked at him the wrong way, or looked at Jeffree the wrong way etc etc etc who knows

2. I think he heard Tati’s story in the video and shortly after received a text, voicemail,email (whatever) from someone he knew fairly well or was connected too accusing James of doing something similar and inappropriate. So he decided to go on a full on Twitter rage campaign.

3. I think after this rampage his lawyers probably told him to stfu bc unless the person he talked to came forward, or had proof anything Jeffree said could be considered slanderous.

4. I think whatever he does have in his phone is probably not enough to take to the police...or if it was it may be outing a victim without their approval. So he made the video saying he was going to not show it to make himself look like the bigger person and avoid possible lawsuits and god knows what else if he played something that was a lie or out of context...even if wasn’t aware if it was one of those things.

NOW!!!:

I think after Jeffree and Nate broke up Jeffree May have started to not see everything with rose colored glasses anymore. I think he may have tweeted out to James about the Charlie video to try to contact him again. I think he probably even felt bad about what happened. 

However, during the keemstar interview when they were kind of insinuating he may be keeping things from everyone etc etc he had to back track a little and say that he did indeed have SOMETHING. However, he also reached out and BASICALLY said “hey James I have this come listen to it and explain it to me. I want to know if this is true or if this person was being untruthful with me some reason” 

ALL of this leads me to believe that some part of this had to do with Nathan or someone close to Nathan and now Jeffree is not sure who he should believe. It would make sense to me that if James was “inappropriate” with someone close to Nate,or with Nate himself, that Jeffree would IMMEDIATELY jump to his “rescue” by calling James a predator on Twitter.  It also explains why he would 100% believe someone then, but might be questioning it now. 

I don’t mean any of this to wipe any fault away from him or anything bc he has definitely f*d up.....but....from what info we have this makes the most sense to me."
2378,2020-05-06 03:49:25,gclb94,"I also thought maybe Nate and James had some kind of beef which made Jeffree jump in on his takedown. However like one of the interviewers pointed out, this whole James situation sounds eerily like the Dhavie Vanity situation. Even down to ""exposing"" him on Twitter and then turning around and working with him again. If he thinks James is a danger to society then why is he reaching out to him? It seems very suspicious at least to me, but that could be the case!"
2379,2020-05-18 04:16:31,gclb94,That indeed is a very excellent speculation!
2380,2020-06-06 20:16:27,gclb94,I think Nate may have had a role but Jeffree is pure evil- he probably encouraged Tati to post about james and his ‘manipulation to straight men’ and wanted him out of the way causes he’s Jeffrees main competition on the platform...
2381,2020-06-06 20:17:57,gclb94,Also he commented in on moms basement that he doesn’t care about numbers and then contradicted himself and said he already won and Tati was still in the red or somthing- he cares about James because he’s standing in his way to being on top. He’s a Physcopath who only cares about his wallet
2382,2020-05-06 03:51:15,gclb94,"That could definitely be it as well, I just thought it was coincidental that the dates matched up to some extent. like I said, just my thoughts!"
2383,2020-05-03 16:10:23,gclb94,"That could be it as well, if not a combination of the two, regardless I dont even think jeffree can hide that something big is up. Also cant shake the feeling Tati and James are talking again behind the scenes and this scares Jeffree so hes trying to get to James before Tati does. Why is Jeffree out of the blue telling James publically he has dirt on him and to call him?"
2384,2020-05-06 16:04:05,gclb94,"Well, he hasn’t worked with James again yet. That’s why what I think is that Jeffree doesn’t know what to think about James and maybe all the Dhavie and Nate stuff is making him reconsider some things ....which is why he’s looking for an explanation from James now instead of just shouting things to the wind as he usually does."

2419,2020-06-26 20:04:21,hga8ob,I think we all have to be careful with role modeling anyone particularly celebrities.  The face they put forward is for the camera.  What they do in their private life may not mirror their public persona.   I think it is better to acknowledge the talent of these people and discuss where they come up short.   You can love Michael Jackson's music but be disturbed by his weird behavior.
2420,2020-06-27 02:28:02,hga8ob,"Totally understand. It's just that right now it's hard to find someone i can recommend for them to watch instead.


I don't live with my nibling and their parents, though accepting and understanding aren't too involved with their children's lives. I don't think they have the time to discuss with them the issues and intricacies with these youtubers and manage 2 other children.


My problem with JS and JC is that they are openly problematic, unlike in my time, without social media, things (good and bad) were not as public.

2503,2020-06-26 22:36:04,hg3t7c,"If we are looking for more movies to add to this shared universe, these are some movies that look like good candidates.

The *Running Man*, which has Arnold Schwarzenegger (*Predator*, *Total Recall*), María Conchita Alonso (*Predator 2*), Yaphet Kotto (*Alien 1*), Jesse Ventura (*Predator 1*), and Sven-Ole Thorsen (*Predator 1* and in *Soldier*, though only a stuntman).

*Soldier* (mentioned elsewhere in this thread)

*Event Horizon* (mentioned elsewhere in this thread)

The *Terminator* series as an alternate timeline (mentioned elsewhere in this thread)

*Westworld*, which could be fit in somewhere if we accept that Delos exists after *Blade Runner 2* when Replicants are abandoned, but before Synthetics are introduced on a large scale.

*Moon*, which would tie really well into the *Blade Runner* universe all by itself.

*****

Movies I wish I could add, but probably shouldn't:

* *Escape From New York*: If considered as contemporary with the events of *RoboCop 1* and *Predator 2*, it would fit in pretty well. Crime is rampant everywhere, it has Kurt Russell and Harry Dean Stanton, and it introduces fusion energy as a working technology from the 1980s onward. Unfortunately it also had a sequel which wipes out LA just a couple years after the events of *Predator 2* and causes a worldwide blackout at the end of the second movie (in real life, likely a shower of EMP attacks all over the planet). This supposedly happens in 2013, which would make it impossible for Tyrell Corporation to have their headquarters in Los Angeles.

* *2001: Space Odyssey* and *2010*: The ""Apple Wins the World"" aesthetic fits, the computers look superficially similar, and the problems with HAL-9000 illustrate the problem of keeping AI from turning on you, but widespread knowledge of extraterrestrials isn't ever supposed to be commonplace. Governments, corporations, and the military may know about them, but the average person? Their first encounter with evidence of Predators or Xenomorphs or the Engineers is always a shock to them. Having Jupiter explode into a star while HAL-9000 sends an SMS back home for everyone to read, kind of takes away from all that."
2504,2020-06-26 22:51:39,hg3t7c,This adds nothing to the movie.
2505,2020-06-26 23:01:59,hg3t7c,"You also miss *Terminator* in here. in T2 Judgement Day,  Cyberdyne was originally set to appear in Bladerunner and Alien ,but was last minute changed to Hyperdyne (A Weyland Yutani Subsidiary). It follows that the first encounter with the predator made Dutch the ideal candidate for the prototype of the Model 101 Terminator. in T2, Cyberdyne is bankrupted by the destruction of their work on Skynet and the Terminator chip, in the original timeline, it's Yautja (predator species) tech that is the basis for the advancement, But in T2, we see it was the terminator itself. When The Terminator is destroyed by Sarah Connor, and Later by John and Sara along with another Terminator, Cyberdyne is bankrupted, but enough of their research survives and is bought out by Weyland-Yutani. 

Weyland then proceeds to use this research as the foundation for the first Synthetic Humans or Replicants, The tech that goes into Skynet is repurposed instead of military satellites, but to long distance spacecraft as part of the M.O.T.H.E.R. Core in Alien."

""In AVP 1, existence of the Xenomorphs was revealed to Weyland""

But in the more notably canon Prometheus Weyland is killed before the xenomorphs come into existence."
2511,2020-06-26 23:27:41,hg3t7c,I’ve always considered the two films to exist in the same realm.
2512,2020-06-28 03:41:12,hg3t7c,"*Angel* (the tv series about the vampire with a soul), and consequently the series that spun off from, *Buffy the Vampire Slayer*, must exist in that universe too... somehow (given the timeframe, with Blade Runner taking place in 2019 and all), because Weyland-Yutani was one of the clients of Wolfram & Hart."
2513,2020-06-28 09:19:32,hg3t7c,The TV series Firefly has a connection to this universe as one of their auto-cannons has a Weyland-Yutani operating system in it.
2514,2020-06-29 01:34:12,hg3t7c,"I don't think this was intended by the writers, but it's a fun theory, so I'll go with it. And there are at least two more shows you could link to Alien, Blade Runner, and the rest.

  
Firstly, there are some connections to Firefly:

* In the first episode of Firefly there is a Weyland-Yutani logo on Mal's screen.
* The design of the Nostromo is very similar to that of an Alliance Cruiser from Firefly.
* In Serenity the Operative says ""We're making a better world"" which sounds almost like the Weyland-Yutani slogan ""building better worlds"".
* In several Alien novels and comics there is a single Terran government. This government could be the Sino-American Alliance from Firefly.
* In Firefly there was a mass exodus from Earth. In Alien Resurrection it is implied that Earth is uninhabitable. In Blade Runner the planet appears to be dying, and people are encouraged to leave Earth.
* Reavers from Firefly are a failed attempt to mass-reprogram humans. Could be based on technology from Total Recall and/or Blade Runner.
* The first draft of the script of Alien Resurrection was written by Joss Whedon
* In Alien Resurrection we see a xenomorph-human hybrid. If they continued research into hybridization of these two species, perhaps they would eventually be able to create mostly human hybrid-supersoldiers like River Tam.

There are also some possible connections to Battlestar Galactica.

* Battlestar Galactica takes place 150,000 years in the past, and it ends with the characters arriving on Earth.
* The humanoid Cylons are very similar to Replicants from Blade Runner.
* One of the big themes of Battlestar Galactica is that history keeps repeating itself. So it would make sense if the descendants of the Twelve Colonies eventually developed robots and Replicants. And sooner or later there would have to be another robot/replicant uprising followed by a mass exodus from their planet.
* There's also a deliberate Firefly easter egg in one episode of BSG where you can see a Serenity type spaceship.

Something else just occured to me. Xenomorphs are one of the favourite preys of the Predators. They like hunting them so much that they transport Xenomorph eggs to different planets where they can procreate.

Humans are also one of their favourite preys so they don't want us to go extinct. This is implied in the first AVP movie when the Predators had to nuke an ancient pyramid city because the Xenomorphs had reproduced uncontrollably so that there were too many of them. This could have gone wrong easily, and the Predators probably know this.

So perhaps there are sanctuary planets out there where humans can live and reproduce freely (except for the occasional visit by Predators in a hunting mood). And perhaps this is where planet Kobol and the Twelve Colonies from Battlestar Galactica come from."
2515,2020-07-04 19:16:02,hg3t7c,"And who knows but maybe this will just get folded into the Marvel Comic Universe.

https://movieweb.com/alien-predator-comic-books-marvel-crossover-2021/"
2516,2020-07-07 10:03:59,hg3t7c,"Great theory and research! My one addition to it would be that Predators is between 2005-2009, since the AA-12 shotgun Adrian Brody's character uses went into production for military and police use until 2005. This, along with the clothing and equipment the more military oriented characters wear appears to be more modern, similar to what is used by current armed forces and PMCs."
2517,2020-08-25 19:06:30,hg3t7c,Cyberpunk
2518,2020-06-26 18:08:51,hg3t7c,"It’s a fun theory, but that’s not really pertinent to his struggle or the story as a whole. His whole conflict was about facing his mortality. It’s not that he’s seen aliens. It’s the fact that he’s this superior creature that’s witnessed and lived incredible moments that humans probably can’t. And that those moments will disappear when he does. 

I understand this is fan theories, and it’s fun to think about."
2519,2020-06-26 17:37:38,hg3t7c,"I had thought that Pitch Black would have fit perfectly into the Aliens/Predator Universe, then Chronicles of Riddick came along and ruined that (I think).

Also, Westworld might work here too.  And not necessarily the fantastic new series, but the original film."
2520,2020-06-26 17:43:29,hg3t7c,I dig it
2521,2020-06-26 13:30:26,hg3t7c,"I was going to say.  Soldier is the best connection (IMO).  I consider it likely he was an early form of replicant, already in the process of being replaced with the next best thing."
2522,2020-06-26 19:04:10,hg3t7c,"I'd considered looking at *Soldier* but never got around to it. I like the movie and its story would be quite fitting in the 'grunge tech' universe.

It has Gary Busey in it as a military character, which is a big plus.

It has Jason Isaacs and Sean Pertwee, who were both in *Event Horizon* (another worthy suggestion).

It has Carsten Norgaard, who was also in *AVP 1*.

It has Elizabeth Dennehy, who was also in *Total Recall*.

Though Jeremy Bolt had only a bit part in *Soldier*, he was co-producer of *Event Horizon*, which might count for something, I don't know."
2523,2020-06-26 17:52:37,hg3t7c,Holy shit. I had no idea that took place in the same universe. I also don't think I've seen it since the early 2000s...
2524,2020-06-26 21:31:26,hg3t7c,"man, I haven't seen Soldier since I watched it on TV back when I was still in highschool, now I watch it last night and all the sudden see it referenced today. 

I also never put together that it was supposed to be the same universe, but then again I don't think there are any threads connecting the two other than the screenwriters intentions. 

thats super cool though, and now I'll probably be thinking about it the rest of the day, thanks for the cool fact."
2525,2020-06-26 18:57:04,hg3t7c,"This would have to be a different, special kind of FTL that ships like the *Nostromo*, *Sulaco*, *Betty*, and *Auriga* don't use. Maybe it's supposed to be instant teleportation instead of space warp. In theory, *Event Horizon* was supposed to go straight to Alpha Centauri and back from Neptune orbit. But the designer of the engine didn't, shall we say, have all the facts.

Both *Event Horizon* and *Predator 3* have Lawrence Fishburne, so there's that."
2526,2020-06-26 14:59:24,hg3t7c,Yes.
2527,2020-06-26 17:50:43,hg3t7c,"i'd rather not have nightmares tonight, thx though."
2528,2020-06-26 18:21:47,hg3t7c,"No, it's 2084, check the [back of the VHS sleeve](https://vhscollector.com/sites/default/files/vhsimages/21891_Total%2520Recall%2520VHS%2520Back%2520Cover.jpg). I remember reading that the director deliberately chose that year because it would be far enough from the year of release, 1990, that the film wouldn't appear dated too soon-- like ""Blade runner"" did, with its 2019 setting. I don't mind that, though, because I don't expect science fiction films to accurately predict the future so much as to accurately reflect the present."
2529,2020-06-26 18:33:15,hg3t7c,"With *Total Recall* we get Kuato, who has the ability to read minds and unlock memories. Basically a telepath, so the Precogs wouldn't be unprecedented."

That was a really entertaining movie.  And at the end, when he’s holding the boy, just a minor tilt of his head and so much is conveyed."
2532,2020-06-26 14:58:01,hg3t7c,"I think while these genre and sub genre distinctions are often useful, particularly when creating an aesthetic, too many sub genres gets in the way as often as it helps."
2533,2020-06-26 11:12:55,hg3t7c,"Improvisation or not, they left it in the movie."
2534,2020-06-26 11:47:30,hg3t7c,"What I think of as ""Cyberpunk"" is neon and chrome, shiny and glowing and looking futuristic. Lots of color, electric everything. There's some of that in *Blade Runner 1* and *2* and in the *RoboCop* movies to a lesser extent but I believe it's all gone in a hundred years, or it just makes it out into space where all of that glorious future stuff just seems pretentious company propaganda.

The sets of *Nostromo*, Gateway Station, *Sulaco*, and Hadley's Hope are dirty, colorless, not very shiny, and frankly rather primitive. Yes, *Alien* was made in 1979 and computer graphics weren't that great but I'd say the style is kind of burnt-in to the atmosphere of the whole show. In the video games they are faithful to this aesthetic to the point where they try to avoid anything that looks _too_ futuristic (except when showing Space Jockey or Predator tech) because it will clash with what weak strides humans have made.

It's also a way to represent visually the prevailing mood of the people living and working in space or the off-world colonies. Nobody likes their job, everyone feels like just a gear in the machine. It's supposed to be utopia, but it's a fake plastic utopia that the company shoves down your throat so you don't grumble about how small your shares are going to turn out to be."
2535,2020-06-26 14:31:27,hg3t7c,The entire speech wasnt improvised. Just part of it at the end
2536,2020-09-11 16:20:27,hg3t7c,"Sorry to resurrect an old thread, but when I heard about the genre ""Cassette Retro"" or [Cassette Futurism](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassetteFuturism) the other day, I realized it was exactly what I'd been looking for.

But you are right to say that a lot of it (especially the neon parts, flying cars, film noir plot exposition) is definitive cyberpunk."
2537,2020-06-26 18:50:50,hg3t7c,"I thought about that, but didn't look for any similar characters or possible easter eggs that could link the two. Similar story and genre isn't enough to bring it in."
2538,2020-06-26 18:44:06,hg3t7c,"Honestly, most of the work was just manhandling the copy and paste from the actor lists to let Word process them into a table that would let me sort by any data value."
2539,2020-06-26 18:07:48,hg3t7c,"It’s not healthy to think this hard about cyberpunk, but if you’re gonna do it then you might as well bun the rest of us out too"

But since we see no Xeno experiments with Replicants, It might have been a dead end or just too expensive to use a Replicant or a human clone just to make a chestburster--cheaper just to snatch someone off the space lane in a cryotube and use them instead."
2541,2020-06-26 20:07:30,hg3t7c,"It's tempting, but the *Terminator* universe adds time travel which is a whole other can of worms. Skynet also makes AI creation look way too easy. Synthetic intelligence of a form that can interface with human society without getting rejected seems really, really hard to do right. Ash and David were basically sociopathic time bombs, Bishop was far too deferential and pacifistic (refusing a handgun even for self-defense), and Call was an emotional mess. No wonder synthetics seemed to have been phased out by *Alien 4*'s era. Network-based AI with parallel computing as a cyberpunkish element seems conspicuously absent in all the Grunge Tech movies.

Skynet and David are both homicidal racist fanatics but with very different origins. The *Terminator* universe has a strong bias against AI. Any attempt to build one ends up dooming the human race to a Machine War. At the end of *Terminator 2*, both HK CPUs had to be destroyed or someone else would just make the same mistake as Dyson and Cyberdyne. It also carries the unfortunate implication that the human race is always going to be racing against time (so to speak) because someone else will eventually create another AI and start the process all over again.

You would have to put all the *Terminator* movies aside as alternate future history which eventually leads to humans trying Replicant technology first, before doing anything related to AI (and definitely no distributed computing, anywhere, for any reason). Install the best behavioral inhibitors on your synths and keep the big computers (ship and station systems) 'dumb', so to speak, or use a mainframe and dumb terminal arrangement like on the *Nostromo* (with FTL communication), so that any AI that gets ""smart"" can't avoid getting terminated before it starts getting genocidal notions.

The *Terminator* continuity is a hot mess all by itself, but if you accept every movie in the series as an another timeline that eventually leads back to a timeline where Skynet accidentally erases itself from existence and disinvents the time machine altogether (a common trope for time travel), then maybe you could make it work."

The Event Horizon was an attempt to instantly jump from one point to another, which would require moving through the deepest parts of the Warp, no matter how briefly. The ship was adrift in there for years.

The early history of FTL after that might involve a safer, but much slower method of Warp travel that essentially “skims” over the “surface” of the Warp without really penetrating it.

The crew in Event Horizon uses a system of suspended animation gravity couches during acceleration to high subluminal speeds. The ships in Alien and Aliens also use a tech like this during long distance flight, perhaps as an extra precaution so that no one who is traveling through space realizes that their ship is essentially skipping across the surface of Hell like a rock thrown over a pond every time they go FTL.

I can probably come up with other connections, too. The second production Robocop unit is essentially a crude form of dreadnought..."

Blade Runner is irrefutably one of the most iconic examples of cyberpunk as a genre in film. I don't know how you managed to write an entire essay on Blade Runner and not realise the genre of storytelling it falls under but it would probably do you well to read up on what cyberpunk actually is."

But it's not archetypal; the movie (especially the theatrical release) hits me like a synthesis of cyberpunk and noir, with elements of each played against the other.  I think this might be part of what the parent comment is getting at; *Blade Runner* uses motifs and style choices that feel distinctly out-of-place when compared the source novel, or to ""undiluted"" cyberpunk in general.

(Of course, *Neuromancer* appropriated noir as well— the Raymond Chandler comparison has been made more than once— but that one seems way more integrated to me.  A literary inspiration rather than a blurring of genre lines.)"

Case has that moral ambiguity of a noir gumshoe, and even moreso the streetwise affect in opposition to a semi-criminal and even less moral institution 

That interplay between noir and scifi is, I thought, one of the hallmarks of cyberpunk. To look at the future not as bright and utopian, nor even grittily operatic like *Star Wars*, but full of all the same bullshit around us today. The result of that clash of noir and scifi is a society in which, despite the fact that humans have reached space, everyone’s motivations and flaws are still grossly mundane."

I don't mean to suggest that it isn't, or to insist on a clean break between genres.  But there's cyberpunk without noir (I can't remember a hint of noir in the *Mirrorshades* anthology), and then on the other hand there's the theatrical release of *Blade Runner*, which I can't interpret as anything other than explicit pastiche.  Harrison Ford's voiceovers are, I guess, the dealbreaker for me; the director's cut works as pure cyberpunk.

(This is a different and smaller objection than the parent comment's, which I agree seems to be based on a limited view of the genre.  I absolutely agree that *Blade Runner*'s dystopian grime, pessimism, and darkness are not at all at odds with the cyberpunk genre.)"

The Barmen Declaration (which was mostly written by Barth) rejected the influence of current politics on the church or any mixing of the two. ""We reject the false doctrine, as though the Church in human arrogance could place the Word and work of the Lord in the service of any arbitrarily chosen desires, purposes, and plans.""

But even earlier, back in the 1920s, Barth resisted appropriating Christ for politics: “The Kingdom of God does not first begin with our movements of protest. It is the revolution which is before all revolutions, as it is before the whole prevailing order of things.” And Barth resisted ""secularizing Christ for the umpteenth time, today for the sake of democracy, or pacifism, or the youth movement or something of the sort"". 

Explicitly aligning yourself as a Christian with a political movement from outside the church is a risky endeavour. Same for being carried away by the hot issue of the day (either in agreement or disagreement). Christ is King; we answer to Him alone and all our words and deeds should reflect that allegiance, even when we speak into current affairs."

BLM / M4BL is completely anti-Christian. They hate the nuclear family, they are pro-abortion, pro-LGBTQIA+. They are driven by marxist, intersectional, and critical race ideologies. Their movement can only continue to destroy. It will not produce fruit.

Boettner's footnote reads:

> A scientific commission appointed by pope Paul VI in July, 1968, to investigate the antiquity of the ""Chair of St. Peter,"" using modern scientific methods for dating old objects, reported early in 1969 that the chair dates from the late ninth century. It is of French origin. There is some evidence that it was the coronation chair of Charles II, king of France, known as Charles the Bald, who was crowned in Rome on Christmas day, 875, by John VIII, in an attempt to restore the Western (Holy Roman) empire. Hence while it may have historical and symbolical value, it is not an antique of the first century.

Did the pope's commission invalidate the doctrine of papal infallibility? No, a charitable interpretation of the report is that the throne now venerated as the Chair of St. Peter (*Cathedra Petri*), a relic with its own feast day, bears no evidence of being original to the Apostle Peter.

Similarly, a charitable interpretation of Boettner's footnote is that it explains the determination of the commission to clarify what this throne actually is, and that it should not be confused with a chair owned or used by the Apostle Peter: ""Hence while it may have historical and symbolical value, it is not an antique of the first century.""

This footnote is a comment to a sentence which does not end where your quotation does, but has a fuller sense:

> It will be noticed that in this pronouncement [from the Vatican Council, which Boettner has just quoted and which shows that he understood what was meant by the term *ex cathedra*] there are three important restrictions: (1) Infallibility is not claimed for every statement made by the pope, but only for those made when he is speaking *ex cathedra*, that is, seated in his papal chair, the chair of St. Peter, and speaking in his official capacity as head of the church.

Therefore it is mistaken to assert:

> But, had he taken more than five minutes to research what Catholics actually believe, he would have realized that the term *ex cathedra* has nothing whatever to do with the chair the Pope is seated on.

Pope Benedict XIV, for instance, [explained on the Feast of the Chair of St. Peter](http://www.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/audiences/2006/documents/hf_ben-xvi_aud_20060222.html):

> ""Cathedra"" literally means the established seat of the Bishop, placed in the mother church of a diocese which for this reason is known as a ""cathedral""; it is the symbol [simbolo] of the Bishop's authority and in particular, of his ""magisterium"", that is, the evangelical teaching which, as a successor of the Apostles, he is called to safeguard and to transmit to the Christian Community.

> ...

> The See [i.e., *sedes*, seat] of Rome, after St Peter's travels, thus came to be recognized as the See of the Successor of Peter, and its Bishop's ""cathedra"" represented the mission entrusted to him by Christ to tend his entire flock.

> Celebrating the ""Chair"" of Peter, therefore, as we are doing today, means attributing a strong spiritual significance to it and recognizing it as a privileged sign of the love of God, the eternal Good Shepherd, who wanted to gather his whole Church and lead her on the path of salvation.

Presbyterian elders sit at the church *session*, and Christ himself speaks of the seat of Moses as a position of authority (Matt. 23:1-3). Since the word *cathedra* refers to a chair, to dismiss any connection between the term *ex cathedra* and a chair is, in this context, too severe a judgment.

Boettner's belief is that in the twentieth century, the Vatican had repeatedly weakened its own moral credibility by supporting fascist regimes (Franco's Spain, Mussolini's Italy) and fascist policies (blessing Italian and German troops during the Second World War, Ratlines), thereby creating popular resentment, especially in the aftermath of Allied victory in 1945.

Many historically Roman Catholic countries have been convulsed with anti-clerical violence in the modern past, from revolutionary France to revolutionary Mexico to republican Spain to post-war Italy. The naturally anti-clerical Communists in France, Italy, Greece, and elsewhere had formed powerful resistance groups during the Second World War, but after the war these nations did not become Communist, in part because of American financial assistance and military occupation. Yet if America itself were to become Roman Catholic, it would likely, according to Boettner, become such a poor defense against Communism that the world would be vulnerable to Soviet conquest:

> Roman Catholicism opposes Communism, of course, as one totalitarian system opposes another. And for propaganda purposes she even attempts to present herself as the chief opponent of, and the chief bulwark against, Communism. But the fact is that during the past fifteen years Communism has made its greatest gains in Roman Catholic nations, both in Europe and in Latin America, while the Protestant nations, the United States, Britain, Canada, Holland, Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, have been its most effective opponents. It is in reality only a short step from a totalitarian church to a totalitarian state, since the people have been trained to accept authority as it is imposed upon them rather than to think for themselves and to manage their own affairs."
2612,2020-06-26 13:21:44,hg12xr,"No, they weren't. In fact, 1962 is the year Vaticanum II started, so this before Liberation theology and the formal acceptance of liberal politics which opened up a lot of room for more explicitly leftist politics for Catholics.

This is still the period where both Franco in Spain and Salazar in Portugal had fairly strong support from Rome for being Catholic, right wing, anti-communist Dictators.

The Soviet Union on the other hand not only had a ideology that was antithetical to Roman Catholicism, but actively persecuted and hindered the Catholic Church.

&#x200B;

Intersectional thinking lends social credibility to people who are of oppressed classes and gives you ""bonus points"" if you are part of one or more of an oppressed group. E.g. women, blacks, trans, L/B, etc. are all ""oppressed"" groups. And so if you are a black woman, then you start from that intersection and everything around you is seen through that lens. It essentially argues that you cannot understand someone else's perspective unless you have been there and you and your ""truth"" are meaningless unless you come from some sort of more intersected category (e.g. black trans woman). The result is that when you say you want ""equality"" and ""everyone has a voice at the table"" well the table MUST include people from the vast number of intersections or else it isn't complete.

As far as critical race theory, CRT is something I've been slowly learning about, but ultimately CRT gives birth to intersectional thinking. Ultimately CRT gives a background for understanding that ""truth"" can be understood through racial lenses. Therefore I, as a white person, have a way of thinking that is defined by my race. And you as a black person, have a way of thinking that is defined by your race. But for some reason the ""white race"" has dominated thought for too long and therefore you as a black person must ""start over again"" and question everything because you need to be ""free"" of ""white thought"" because it is a means of oppression over you. You have to hold everything in a critical fashion (questioning it) because of race.

Certainly in my own country - Australia - the 1950s and 1960s saw a bit of communist influence in the Australian Labor Party. This actually caused a split in the party, and the anti-communist part of the ALP was dominated by Catholics. Many Catholics ended up leaving the ALP as a result, and formed the ""[Democratic Labor Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Labor_Party_\(historical\))"" which ended up spoiling potential ALP election victories in the 1960s by splitting the votes.

Boettner, writing in 1962, was obviously quite ignorant of the ructions within the Catholic Church over Communism and Marxism, and probably lumped them both together as ""the enemy"". Catholicism was often mixed in with conspiracy theories at the time, including those which included JFK. He was also obviously influenced by the sort of rampant sectarianism that classes all opponents as worthy of total contempt.

>Intersectionality is a theoretical framework for understanding how aspects of a person's social and political identities (e.g., gender, race, class, sexuality, ability, physical appearance,[1][2] height,[3] etc.) might combine to create unique modes of discrimination and privilege. Intersectionality identifies advantages and disadvantages that are felt by people due to a combination of factors. For example, a black woman might face discrimination from a business that is not distinctly due to her race (because the business does not discriminate against black men) nor distinctly due to her gender (because the business does not discriminate against white women), but due to a unique combination of the two factors.

To christianize it, imagine that you're travelling in Egypt. You will have a different experience in Cairo than an Egyptian Christian, and a different experience than an Egyptian Muslim. That's not a terribly controversial thought, is it?"
2667,2020-07-01 18:34:57,hg12xr,"Are you referring to Boettner's argument? I don't agree with his speculation, but the historical record shows that the Vatican supported fascists and Nazis, and it often did so in order to oppose Communism:

1. *Action française*
1. Pétain and Nazi collaborators in Vichy France
1. Franco and the Falangists of Spain
1. Mussolini and Italian fascists
1. Hitler and other Nazis
1. The Roman Catholic priest Jozef Tiso and his Nazi client state
1. the Ustaše of Croatia

And so on. That the Vatican also denied and condemned certain tenets of fascism does not change its real support of fascism or its silence in the face of injustice and violence.

The Vatican's unwillingness to stand as a clear witness against fascist regimes is made more conspicuous because the pope had long claimed supremacy over the whole Church (in the fourteenth century in *Unam sanctam*), and popes had invalidated the political authority of rulers in the past, even ordering Roman Catholics to rebel against authority or else fall under excommunication. For instance, in the bull *Regnans in Excelsis*, Pope Pius V declared Queen Elizabeth excommunicated and involved those who obeyed her in excommunication:

> But the number of the ungodly has so much grown in power that there is no place left in the world which they have not tried to corrupt with their most wicked doctrines; and among others, **Elizabeth, the pretended queen of England and the servant of crime**, has assisted in this, with whom as in a sanctuary the most pernicious of all have found refuge. ...

> And moreover **we declare her to be deprived of her pretended title to the aforesaid crown and of all lordship, dignity, and privilege whatsoever**.

> And also **the nobles, subjects and people of the said realm and all others who have in any way sworn oaths to her, to be forever absolved from such an oath and from any duty arising from lordship, fealty and obedience**; and we do, by authority of these presents, so absolve them and so deprive the same Elizabeth of her pretended title to the crown and all other the above said matters. We charge and command all and singular the nobles, subjects, peoples and others aforesaid that they do not dare obey her orders, mandates and laws. Those who shall act to the contrary we include in the like sentence of excommunication.

The pope believed he had the authority to deprive rulers of all lordship, dignity, privilege, and title. He could have applied the emphasized passages to Mussolini, Hitler, and others, depriving them of their authority, but he didn't. He could have declared all peoples in Germany, Italy, France, etc. to be free of the obedience to their rulers, and to resist their rule. Instead, the Vatican entered into a series of concordats with these nations, agreements for mutual recognition and special privileges.

The Vatican did issue *Mit brennender Sorge*, but as the political philosopher and papist priest Rhonheimer says:

> We are told that the Church's condemnation of racism and the Nazi ideology of the state, expressed most clearly in *Mit brennender Sorge*, and in the ""Syllabus against Racism"" of 1938 (a Vatican decree directing Catholic universities throughout the world to counter racist theories), was clear to everyone. Equally clear, according to this argument, was the Church’s defense of the Jews and its condemnation of their persecutors. The same is sometimes claimed also for Pius XII's first encyclical, *Summi Pontificatus*, issued in October 1939.

> This defense of the Church, however, fails to account for a number of important facts. It ignores the existence of a specifically modern anti-Semitism, shared in varying degrees by Catholics. Nourished by traditional Christian anti-Judaism, it had social, political, and economic aspects as well. In its Catholic form it was rooted in the Church's political and social antimodernism, especially its opposition to liberalism and all its works. For German Catholics this resulted in openness to *volkisch* and racist ideas that blurred the boundaries with Nazi ideology. Finally, there was the Catholic openness to an authoritarian state, which allowed people to think, at the start of Hitler's rule, that the Nazi state might be an acceptable alternative to liberal democracy and a bulwark against the looming threat of Bolshevism.

> It was thus possible in 1933, and even as late as 1937, for a Catholic to reject Nazi racial doctrine yet remain an anti-Semite and a supporter of the Nazi regime. **Indeed, historical research has shown that after 1933 parts of the Catholic press in Germany, and even more so in Austria, were increasingly hostile to Jews—and this despite their consistent rejection of Nazi racial doctrine.** As a ""Christian anti-Semite"" and patriotic German, a Catholic could approve of the Nazis' treatment of the Jews, or at least show understanding for it.

> Take, for example, an article on ""The Jewish Question,"" published in the Catholic *Augsburger Postzeitung* on March 31, 1933, which incorporated a statement of the (Catholic) Bavarian People's Party. Deploring ""the increasing 'judaizing' (*Verjudung*) of our intellectual, cultural, and scholarly life in Germany,"" the article asserted that ""there is a certain kind of Jewish intellectualism which, despite its high intelligence, mixes with the German element in a destructive and baneful way. A people striving for national and intellectual renewal is reacting in a healthy manner when it opposes this admixture and demands that the German mind be thoroughly cleansed of Jewish influences.""

> Such statements require us to reconsider the Church's public declarations about the Nazi concept of the state and racism in the encyclical *Mit brennender Sorge*. Not only were Church declarations belated. They were also inadequate to counter the passivity and widespread indifference to the fate of Jews caused by this kind of Christian anti-Judaism and anti-Semitism, especially when it was combined with newly awakened national pride. The encyclical, then, came far too late to be of any help to Jews.

Therefore German papists, insofar as they can be considered a political group in the Weimar Republic, did not vote against Hitler but voted for their own political parties (similarly, the Italian People's Party was formed by a papist priest as an alternative to socialism, but the party became divided over the question of Italian fascism). The Nazi jurist and papist Carl Schmitt would repeatedly and unrepentantly demonstrate the correspondence between fascism and Roman Catholicism before, during, and after the Second World War."

For a European political party there is nothing particularly exceptional in there.   I wouldn’t panic too much about the Western nuclear family requirement.   Extended families are generally healthier than nuclear families.

This is what they actually say about family:

>We disrupt the Western-prescribed nuclear family structure requirement by supporting each other as extended families and “villages” that collectively care for one another, especially our children, to the degree that mothers, parents, and children are comfortable.

This is talkimg about an extension of the family, not an eliminstion of it - basically, looking at child rearing and mutual support as its been practiced around the world for thousands of years. Heck, the church often looks quite a bit like this.

Also, the type of brush you use and whether it is wet or dry will affect how deep the color gets. A fluffy brush can be used to diffuse color over a broader area and blend. A more dense blush can be used to tap color directly into place. If you spray the brush with a bit of setting spray, it should apply more strongly, too.

I really do hope jenna will return and be herself again in time but I understand why she might not. I’m aggravated that she was pulled into it. People need to understand that some people are racist right now and they are saying shit behind the scenes and are awful and THOSE people need to be shut down because that are actively behaving in a way that is unacceptable. As much as I don’t like this excuse, jennas videos were a product of their time, and like you said, she is a person. A large majority of people have been “exposed” for being insensitive in the past, there is a pattern there no doubt. The difference with jeffree star and jenna marbles is that jenna has learned. She takes criticism to heart and her actions show that she is constantly changing and maturing like everyone should. I don’t know jenna personally of course but she does feel like a friend. And I trust that she is a good person based on her RECENT actions. She handled the situation very maturely. People are angry with Shane because he always claims to be “too sensitive” to avoid accountability. Jenna is so damn sensitive but she is mature and grown and can realize when she is wrong. Shane has been acting like a child recently and I’m so pissed that jenna might feel she is even on the same level of toxic as Shane or js. Sorry for this rant I really needed to get this out somewhere"

Well I’m cancelling cancel culture because we need Jenna Fucking Marbles on this earth."

I was certain at any moment he would yell 'Allah Akbar'. Thankfully, my shopping cart was full of bacon (which as you all know, is Mooslem kryptonite). So I straightened my MAGA hat and pulled up my Confederate flag britches and grabbed a pack of bacon from my cart. I took that Mooslem over my knee and spanked his ass with the bacon while screaming 'Liberalism is a mental disorder!' over and over. Then, by the power of the bacon,  Abdul-Mohammed-Jamal-Jabar-Steve-Jabar-Omar-Abdul instantly converted to Christianity and registered as a Republican.

2742,2020-06-25 12:22:06,hfjmhr,"There are a few possibilities that could explain his infrequent posting and his mental health.

Firstly, he has said he has a problem with procrastination. He has so many interests and gets excited about them, so I bet he's thought up of hundreds of video ideas and maybe felt overwhelmed by all the work he would have to do to make them. Perhaps that's the root cause of his procrastination. He also said that he could post once a month, but acknowledged that he doesn't have much of a work ethic to fulfil that promise.

Regarding his hoarding, I think he's on top of it. I follow him on Instagram and he usually makes Insta stories in his house, and it generally looks presentable. Having said that, he tweeted yesterday that his sleep pattern is still unhealthy (he posted a picture of him writing in the Google search bar ""are teeth skeleton"" at 4am). So, you could argue that there's some poor self-control going on in that colourful mind of his. I hope he finds better ways to improve his sleep health and productivity, because if not he may want to seek counselling.

Secondly, there are also other factors — possible negative audience reaction to a video, the editing process, finding sponsorships, etc. — which might make him post so infrequently. These can definitely cause anxiety in a creator who now has amassed over 3 million followers and is affiliated with a very popular, and now shunned, Youtuber.

Lastly, he believes in not hanging around too much in the spotlight. He's stated in a few interviews how he wants to make videos sparingly so that the audience doesn't get oversaturated with his content. Think of it as a ""see you less, miss you more"" approach. IIRC he basically implied he doesn’t want to be David Dobrik.

Mind you, these are things I have observed in his videos, his social media and his interviews. It’s pure speculation, as I don’t know the guy and what he does on a daily basis. Having said that, I think he's fine — he just needs to be more serious in looking after himself."
2743,2020-06-25 18:03:12,hfjmhr,"Thank you so much! I'm glad he seems to be on top of his hoarding. As much as it was talked about in the video in a light comedic fashion, it still made me feel really sad for him that he was going through it. If it is better for his health to not post frequently, or if that's what he wants to do out of a personal choice like you said see you less miss you more approach, then I totally understand that. I really hope that if he is continuing to struggle in a few ways that he can find appropriate help, such as therapy, because I really wish him the best and for him to be his happiest healthiest self, and I hope honestly that he can distance himself from Shane if they are still friends because I don't think Shane is very good for Garrett to be around especially given everything going on right now. I sincerely don't want Garrett involved in this horrid mess."

Brewer would resign his chess game against Newton every time a pawn was lost or the position looked bad. Newton tried to tell him not to give up and play the game out, but Brewer refused. After a month of playing chess and Brewer always resigning early without playing out the game, Newton finally had enough and strangled Brewer. Newton was executed on May 24, 2007 by lethal injection on Ohio. He was the first murderer executed for killing someone over a chess game.

Oh no, this sets up a very bad precedent on why people should not resign too early. ""What's the harm in continuing the game, no one has ever died for it""."

the main bullying force was fuckhead Star, and I really do not understand how he doesn’t see it..."
2821,2020-06-25 00:21:42,hfa9n4,"This, IMO, is one of the main reasons Shane saw so much backlash after that statement. His comments about the beauty community in general were bad enough, but the fact that he still blatantly disdains James Charles and clearly thinks what he did - and what Tati/Jeffree did - was right is just too much to accept tbh. People might have rolled their eyes and been skeptical without those digs, but adding them in was just heinous.

Also, little tip to Shane: Maybe don't use your own mental health issues as an attempt to end ""drama"" immediately after expressing zero remorse for absolutely shattering a teenager's mental health via drama. People should give a fuck when it's you but not so much when it's James? 

That statement was just absolutely tragic - probably the most harmful thing he could have put out short of releasing video/audio/other proof of exactly how he and J* stirred the pot. I'm glad he didn't because now we know how he thinks, but this is why you sit on shit before you release it. It's important to edit that mess down with a clear mind."

2824,2020-06-25 14:40:38,hfa9n4,"I'm one of the people that agrees that James Charles needed a slice of humble pie. However, that was not a slice of humbe pie. They accused him of being a predator for gods sake and J* and Shane still seem to insinuate that he is to this day. It does seem like James Charles matured a lot in this last year and that's great, but that does not excuse their behaviour at all. Just because it ended up being ok does not change that it could have ended very differently. Honestly what a shitty human being do you have to be to not only do that but also feel/show no remorse for it?"
2825,2020-06-24 22:49:52,hfa9n4,"I see your points, but why are people treating james as though he was an innocent child? He was young, but still a grown adult with a massive following of children. 

James definitely didn't deserve the video, but the things Tati said weren't even particularly new. People had been making jokes about James going after straight men and having a big ego for ages before, and people came out after to back up her story (I don't believe her entirely, but I do believe Tati was speaking her truth and so was James) 

Shane shouldn't have included the ""slice of humble pie"" bit in the apology. but I do believe he is genuinely sorry about how it turned out. His apology came off as a bit.. unedited and defensive? He should have thought it through more before posting. But people were going to pick apart whatever he posted so idk."
2826,2020-06-24 22:34:28,hfa9n4,"I think that he probably sees it but doesn't care because, in his words, its ""JeffRee fUckIng sTaR"". J☆ has made Shane MILLIONS. J☆ could probably lick his own shit and Shane would be like he'S fAmiLy. (Idk why I used that analogy). Shane is just not a great person imo 😕 it sucks because I supported him for a couple years."
2827,2020-06-25 18:14:19,hfa9n4,"After everything Shane did in the past, from his past humor and controversies to acting like a hateful diva on the behind the scenes of his movie and other shady things, it's ironic that what made people have enough was this James Charles drama, a person he seems to hate so much and support his destruction lmao"
2828,2020-06-25 16:21:18,hfa9n4,"Yeah, exactly"
2829,2020-06-25 00:35:42,hfa9n4,"Well imo when James was young he was egotistical and made straight men feel uncomfortable (which is gross and wrong). Him and the people that this bothered should've had conversations PRIVATELY. I feel as though there was no need for that to go public.
However, when J☆ and Shane Dawson were young they were being racist and MEGA problematic.
It seems very hypocritical of Shane and J☆ to go after James like that. 
In no way am I saying that James Charles is a baby and innocent I feel like he was probably blinded by the fame he got so quickly and maybe hung out with the wrong people. I'm pretty sure he's changed for the better but I feel like this could've been done and handled differently. Especially by a bunch of fully grown adults. But that's just my opinion and I see where you're coming from."
2830,2020-06-25 03:46:14,hfa9n4,"No one is saying James is innocent. Just that things should have been dealt with privately and not in a video/tweets.

2832,2020-06-25 04:04:34,hfa9n4,The hypocrisy is what really bothers me in all of this. J\* went after James so hard when he was guilty of the exact same thing and worse. And wasn't his boyfriend technically straight?...
2833,2020-06-25 00:28:36,hfa9n4,"I'm over the moon that came out. I think people are gonna see that J☆ is a hypocritical, two faced , lier. I'm so done with him and I was not surprised AT ALL."
2834,2020-06-25 18:18:51,hfa9n4,"Jeffree bragged a lot about Nate being straight. He even said in a video from about a year ago loud and clear that he preferred straight men and had lots of relationships with straight men in the past. Let's not even talk about that there is allegedly some evidence of him posting on a revenge porn website men that didn't want to be ""outed"". He's even seen on camera grabbing a man's crotch without his consent and the man looks very uncomfortable, and he has the audacity of coming for James for feeling attracted to guys who present themselves as straight/more masculine? So far there's no evidence of James having forced these men to do anything... some straight men even tricked James just for clout and tiktok views. I'm not saying James is innocent, but the Jeffree's hypocrisy is something I can't fully grasp lmao"

His luck was that he was the one with the most followers and these ""beauty gurus"" were unlikeable/the viewers were annoyed at them when he decided to attack (because he only attacks when people are at their lowest). Being that both Shane and Jeffree are narcissistic in their own way, I predict a future fallout between them, when one of them sees that they don't need the other anymore and that it won't affect their views and business ditching the other."

In the starting lineup, Jordan > Kobe, Bird >>> Kawhi. People sleep on Moses Malone but he was better than AD (3x MVP). Curry is better than Isiah Thomas, but Isiah was a better defender so would neutralize him a bit. KD is better than McHale, but it depends on which rules they're using. 

The 2016 bench is a lot deeper, but Dr. J, Nique and Barkley are better than everyone in 2016 except Harden and maybe Westbrook."

Yes, Luther battled corruption in his time. But if that’s the *only* thing the Reformation was about, then we’ve fallen into the sneaky Roman Catholic narrative that Rome remains authoritative in teaching even when it slips in practice. That’s not right."
2852,2020-06-24 19:16:17,hf72vk,"Indeed, Tetzel and Albrecht's selling indulgences was more blasphemous than the money changers in the temple."
2853,2020-06-24 22:32:46,hf72vk,"I knew Albrecht was young, I didn't realize he was that young. He wasn't even old enough (depending on who your source is) to be a deacon, let alone a presbyter or bishop."
2854,2020-06-24 20:36:57,hf72vk,"Yeah, I've always seen the corruption as the catalyst that opened the eyes of the Reformers to the false doctrine being propagated. Luther dove into Scripture originally to fight corruption, but then realized there were inconsistencies with doctrine."
2855,2020-06-24 20:51:27,hf72vk,"> sneaky Roman Catholic narrative ...


In my opinion, this is why Francis is so eager to have dialogs and reconcile. He knows there was (and is) corruption but he also knows they can't and won't change decreed dogma – so he diplomatically has dialog, makes diplomatic concessions so others convert to Catholicism."
2856,2020-06-24 19:41:18,hf72vk,"I could never figure out why Catholics are so overtly zealous in their hatred for Luther. It seemed so unreasonable to me. But Catholicism depends on authority and if they concede the Reformation was caused by such corruption then it looks bad on their ""authority"".


So, they demonize Luther and will take no quarter. They will not divert from asserting a narrative that portrays him as an angry red faced monk who rebelliously nailed a protest to their church door. That's just not true. 



So I investigated and discovered the scope of how involved and intertwined Albrecht and the Fugger family were with Leo X and Eck. 


I have to admit it almost made me nauseous."
2857,2020-06-24 20:57:45,hf72vk,"That is also my concern. 

Whether our concerns are founded would be quickly revealed in dialogues. Which is why it’s important to have dialogues, so that one side (that is, the one with more resources) doesn’t own the narrative."

What's your opinion on Benedict? At times he's appeared to me to get pretty close to Lutheran theology but then seemingly gets held back by magisterial infallibility... I do sometimes wonder where his heart is."
2859,2020-06-24 19:46:48,hf72vk,"Yes I have heard people say some pretty awful things about him.  

I love how Luther, ever the pastor, writes a letter to Tetzel to comfort him as Tetzel is dying.  Tetzel had become a pariah and his own church and congregation the Dominicans abandoned him.  Luther basically says don't worry about it dude, you were doing what other people put you up to."
2860,2020-06-25 03:10:28,hf72vk,"I haven’t encountered many Catholics in the modern day that hate Luther, but then again I avoid groups like Catholic Answers and “The Church Militant”.  I know many Jesuits have sympathetic views of Luther (ironic as they were created as counter-reformers.)"

2862,2020-06-24 22:12:13,hf72vk,"In my humble opinion nothing [insert Pope] says will ever or can ever change previous decreed Catholic dogma. 



You’re fooling yourself to think Rome will ever concede one inch on justification. 



We’re not illiterate peasants anymore; we have scripture in our own language, we know history and we can read them in context. We see behind the curtain, the ~~king~~ Pope has no clothes and Jesus didn’t have a ring to kiss.



Catholicism desperately depends on the smoke and mirror primacy in authority and will zealously protect it till Jesus comes and says otherwise. 




Item 1 of the Preamble to the [Joint Declaration On The Doctrine Of Justification](http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/chrstuni/documents/rc_pc_chrstuni_doc_31101999_cath-luth-joint-declaration_en.html) states:



“Doctrinal condemnations were put forward both in the Lutheran Confessions[3] and by the Roman Catholic Church's Council of Trent. These condemnations are still valid today and thus have a church-dividing effect.”"
2863,2020-06-24 19:51:50,hf72vk,Luther is certainly not a saint but things like that and writing a letter to his barber to teach him how to pray shows his heart.

2866,2020-06-24 22:58:58,hf72vk,"Oh absolutely -- Rome will never, ever, concede one bit. They're not allowed to. They know that if they even concede one iota the entire infallible magisterium topples, so instead they're stuck creating more doctrine to try and resolve any past inconsistencies.

My point is I wonder sometimes if Benedict doesn't agree with Luther on things in his heart of hearts, but can never say it aloud. There's often such a profound sadness in his eyes."
2867,2020-06-25 23:25:22,hf72vk,That bad huh?

2872,2020-06-27 21:12:37,hf72vk,"Which tells you something about their theology. They have to view the institution as supremely important - what other justification can they have for having doctrine that extends beyond scripture? If the authority of their church falls, so does much of Catholic doctrine.

Please don't judge Catholicism by online communities, though. The majority of Catholics you meet in real life are great (although many of them don't always realize what their church officially teaches). I am fortunate to count many as friends and family members. And certainly we have some very prickly Lutherans as well."
2873,2020-06-27 23:40:53,hf72vk,"Yeah, I generally have had pleasant encounters with Catholics. That’s kind of why that thread surprised me.  But you are correct, it’s really unfair to judge anyone by an online community that claims to represent a group."

2875,2020-06-24 20:07:33,hf6k2e,"Shane has always been this way. He cycles out friends, thrives on gossip and drama, is vulgar & degenerate.... I could go on. He's never hid who he was. He was attracted to Jeffree and became so close to him BECAUSE this is how he is. Shane is also a manipulator. Shane has admitted to being an asshole on multiple occasions too. 

 In the beginning, he was more religious. He talked about God and saving his virginity until he was married. He tried to be wholesome while also mixing in characters like Shanaynay (gag) and that gross aunt character lol


 Then it went full on gross out humor and really uncomfortable comments on a lot of things. After this he fell from grace and was irrelevant.

 He kinda came back again with Lisa but he was REALLY scummy and gross then. And around the time he made that shit excuse for a movie, he was a nightmare on set and ruined his relationship with his manager Lauren. 

 Then we all remember the Shane that would burn barbies and graze on camera in his kitchen and with Trisha Paytas. I feel like the both of them took advantage of a young and vulnerable Drew Monson. Drew and Trisha revived his relevancy. 

He used Garrett & Drew because he KNEW they were bringing in the views for him. I think Drew dropped Shane because he was way too toxic, and Garrett & Shane fizzled out because Shane was a fucking asshole to him on camera and I can't imagine what he was like off camera. I don't believe it's all a persona. There's truth in every joke."
2876,2020-06-24 19:04:07,hf6k2e,"Shane Dawson has been on YouTube for 15 years. 
For 12 years we’ve been seeing Shane Yaw. These last three years have ushered in Shane Dawson . He is not the same person he used to be, he is putting in an act.

( remember the video defending ryland about how he’s just using Shane he confirmed they all put on a front for the camera, Shane is a “queen queer icon” now, ryland is bougie, Morgan is stupid)


The video: the trailer we all got was Shane diving into the beauty community(BC) investigator style. Why are they so dramatic? Why is there always trouble? Why are they the most problematic community we have in YT? And what I believe, “how can I [ Shane Dawson] fix it. The ONLY manipulation that took place would’ve been Jeffree Star getting in Shane’s ear to direct the series on the business of beauty and them instead of focusing on the drama because J* would be the obvious villain.  Also just spinning the web, JC is plummeting so they can capitalize on that and paint themselves out to be innocent, best friends, unbothered, BC heroes. That is the most manipulation from J* I see. Shane, otherwise, a 30 year old man did everything in his own. 

The statement he deleted: the fact that it’s deleted proves he isn’t sorry. The fact that he said he deserved it proves he isn’t sorry. The fact that he- (remember I said Shane Dawson is a character/this is all an act) - in a very serious post  about a very serious matter is still acting like a drag queen performer and putting on a show “she beat her face/ game of thrones references/ sassy behavior” shows insensitivity and insincerity. The fact that he openly defended J* in a “boys will be boys” fashion shows he’s also complicit with Trish and his other toxic friends behavior as well. 

Also When did he become friends with Tati? To the point of OPENLY defending her in a very shady organized way (I’m sure J* helped) right after the video (bye sisters)was posted?  And why have we never seen them together/ heard about their friendship since then ? 

Shane isn’t this sensitive anxiety filled character he pretends to be which pisses me off the most. The way he defended himself so immediately and strongly when he was being accused of being a pedo doesn’t fit his narrative, his coming out video wasn’t like this, the racism apologies weren’t like this, he was never this shaken, unbathed, dirty, anxious mess until the past few years. People with dark senses of humor like he has, people who make jokes about fucking cats, kids, black people love crack jokes, tits,pussy,dick jokes aren’t like this it takes boldness to be that wrong but in an attempt to rebrand and move away from all that; this is what his character evolved into. 

Imma stop but I could literally go on for hours about him and Jeffree. James has the entire world hate him for a lie, James wanted to kill himself, Shane Dawson, Jeffree Star, and Tati Westbrook profited off of it. Manipulation or not they’re all disgusting and old enough to know better."
2877,2020-06-25 04:49:05,hf6k2e,"Honestly I get so confused when people try and say that his “apology” wasn’t written by him, but by Jeffree. Have you ever seen any of his other apologies? They’re all the same. Blaming other people and trying to come off like an apology all the while he never actually apologises for anything. He has always been like this."
2878,2020-06-24 19:52:05,hf6k2e,Well said.
2879,2020-06-24 18:30:29,hf4b95,"I agree with everything you said, just a little correction. Shane didn't dare to put ANY clips from the ""No More Lies"" video in the series. The clip you saw was from the ""Tati"" video, the one where James apologized in the spot, seemed guilty and was extremely emotional. Our ""Empathetic"" Shane actually made fun of a very distraught James for not talking and only sighing. Shane CHOSE to ignore the Uno card video and CHOSE to include only the things that made James look bad in this trashy series. I'm sure they filmed their reactions to the ""No More Lies"" video. My question is, where are they?"
2880,2020-06-24 18:32:23,hf4b95,"No I'm pretty sure there was a recording of James in no more lies. It was incredibly short. Go back and rewatch The Beautiful World of Shane Dawson, it's at the beginning. James says 'you all saw a side of me I dont like' and it's definitely from the NML video."
2881,2020-06-24 18:43:26,hf4b95,"Yeah, you are right. I went back and checked, but he concentrated on the ""Tati"" video more, and as you said, on the only sentence in the ""No More Lies"" video that showed him as guilty ugh"

Two questions: 

1, I know Hoeff was half trying to deter Wilde, but was he also trying to recruit Wilde himself, or was he saying Wilde should only consider Regaari’s offer? Towards the end of their convo he mentions not to bother with any other offers, and he talks a little about his situation,  and talks about “doing what I do” a lot, but I didn’t hear any explicit offer from him and can’t tell if I’m reading into any implicit offer too much or if I missed it somehow. 

2, does anyone recall who all got Bozo’s puppies? I forgot all about those guys ever since she hulk killed Bozo. 

Also a bit of theorizing, I’m getting the vibe OmoAru have their eyes on Dataspace. It’d explain leaving most of The Last in stasis and being determined to keep their cybernetics. The question is, are they going to be actual allies on Igraen turf and still team with the dominion, or are they thinking of replacing the Igraens and find a new way to regain their dominance? 

I think all the unease surrounding them is a Red Herring. At least in terms of being a threat to the dominion. Their numbers are so few, but that was just The Last, who were least affected by the Droud and most affected by the Huh. So, presumably, pretty much all the folks who weren’t in stasis are still their same laid back dopey selves as when we last saw them. This opens up the morally grey possibility of The Last being able to use their own species as substrate instead of relying on the cultivation of substrate across the galaxy. They don’t have trillions like the Igraens. While it’s definitely a bit reprehensible, it seems most species let the internal politics of other species do their own thing, and if they can be used as a weapon against the Igraens on their own turf, I could see the Gao and Humans, at least, being willing to allow it, as long as they are contained. 

It seems they’re not so far off with their telepathic abilities from being able to digitalize anyway. And I don’t recall any indication the other OmoAru had this ability - it could be something exclusive to The Last. They went into stasis knowing their numbers, and entering data space could have been the plan from the start."

&nbsp;

> There were always so many reasons not to have children in life. She wondered if she’d ever find the right time, or if there even was such a thing.

Honestly, if my people were enslaved to the Hunters, I couldn't imagine why anyone would want to have kids.

&nbsp;

> Uku had never imagined one animal could simultaneously encapsulate fanged threat and simple dopey joy without any apparent conflict.

I wonder if this either means animals from other planets simply have similar ways of communicating playfulness, or maybe the E-skurel-ir once domesticated a dog-like animal a very long time ago. Similar to how dogs can read human expressions and somewhat vice-versa, the E-skurel-ir may still have the ability to read the expressions of their dog-equivalent, and thus read expressions of dogs.

> Soon, they would be ready to receive the first wave of emigrants.

Now, I wonder how much of the new settlements are going to be built by Humans and co versus built solely by E-skurel-ir. Will they rely on Human, Gao, and Ten’Gewek materials or will they come up with their own style? Most of their housing is underground, but will they actually want to emulate that on the new world despite having the most experience building like that? Or will they try to do a hybrid of above and below ground architecture? There are lots of underground cities on Earth. There's also [cliff dwellings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliff_dwelling) used by the Pueblo which would look really cool if there happen to be any valleys or hills nearby. Maybe even something similar to the Shire.

&nbsp;

> That left Six with three options: remain, and risk personality merger; leave, and risk discovery; or terminate Austin.

Wait, if they merged personalities, would that mean Austin would become aware that Six was in his head? Would he gain Six's memories? Or would Six just become more like Austin? I think it's the latter, but the former would be so funny. ""Honey, I just had the weirdest and most vivid dream.""

&nbsp;

>  They definitely were actin’ jus’ a bit weird ‘round me.

Is this because they're telepathic?

> But something in the back of his head was suddenly wary.

They're more robot than biological? Or maybe they are actually a group of Igraens that disagree with the Hierarchy and are puppeteering the OmoAru? I got nothing right now. The fact that they don't want to get rid of the thing *killing* their species is weird. Like sure, the technology might be useful but it would be more useful if it wasn't killing you!

> He got the distinct impression they’d recognized him.

Ohhh... This has all happened before. Their world is a class 9, and may have been a deathworld before the OmoAru did some modifications. Were the Allebenellin and Versa Volcare once like the Gao and Ten’gewek? That's... an interesting thought.

&nbsp;

I'm not going to say they're dumb like in the past because they might not have known the political situation on Earth. Sure they've shut down jump travel for weeks or months and the Hunters might be able to run wild without the space fighter wing but I just can't see this as a strategic blow. 

Strategically the worst fallout from this will be the economic burden, something an America that's just been attacked is incredibly well equipped to deal with. Not to mention aid from the other members of the alliance and Gao. 

In exchange, given that people immediately jump to the conclusion of enemy action, it's unlikely this will be charted up to an accident. So they've managed to completely reverse the momentum that was building for the Allies to shift focus from the galaxy to more domestic concerns."

I don't think this will halt all Wormhole usage Alliance wide, it will definitely put the Americans somewhat out of commission.

Which in turn is a chance for the Directorate and/or the OmoAru to help.

Plus the Gao already feel like they owe humanity an eternal debt.

I do think 006 is (characteristically) naively dismissing how paranoid humans are. Military Intelligence is already operating under the assumption that the Heirarchy moved assets into the system when they pulled that stunt with the nuke, that they file this as an accident and not an act of enemy sabotage isn't even within the realm of plausibility in my opinion.

But did the Hierarchy just figure out WERBS? AND they're desperate enough to ally with the hunters?

Are you perhaps thinking of Specialist Murphy with that comment? Wilde was one of the Royal Navy Marines who boarded the hunter ship that attacked the SOR techs's section of *Caledonia* and landed with Kovac's lifeboat.

Especially if the other nations which were essentially unaffected also refrain from retaliating.  And I could see Chambliss dropping the ball on that, fixating on the economic and logistical damage instead of the military repercussions, leaving the people of Cimbrean thinking he’s more concerned with feeding “real Americans” before fixing the Cimbreans’ own major issues.  That said, he’s also shown to be willing to learn realpolitik, he might be able to come around to finally putting 100% back into the fight."

Assuming a third of a freight train (5000 short tons) and using 2.5 grams = 15 kt (energy detonated in Nagasaki), we can figure this out!

5000 tons / 2.5 grams = ~1.8 million

1.8 million * 15 kt = 2.7 Gigatons!

He showered Shane in designer & Gucci (heck I probably would have fallen for that too, even though I despise J* ), made Shane feel like he could trust him, clearly made Shane sign ridiculous contracts & NDAs and when it looked like shit was going to hit the fan and ruin his reputation he lumped it all on Shane.

3149,2020-07-01 00:28:24,hijrew,"It definitely seems like a set up to me, due to timing. All the videos coming out proving his guilt are pre-2015. If his paedophilia/racism is really such a huge, channel-banning, illegal issue why didn’t the powers-that-be and the influencers (ie. J*), call him out back then?

Answer: convenience. Back then they could go outside and find their own content, now they can’t. 

This doesn’t excuse his past actions, however no one is claiming that he’s a pedo, merely some really poor taste jokes, but somehow the whole argument now is that he’s a pedo.

Not only are times changing and content creators like Shane are stuck in the middle between two different types of societies, but everything you said in addition to the timing is right. 

We're really moving into a new era of social mindfulness, a new generation that will not put up with things that were acceptable before, so creators that have straddled the previous generation and the next are being rightfully criticized for things that used to be acceptable."
3153,2020-06-30 09:10:34,hijrew,Most likely. J* and Shane at this point aren't even friends. They are just corrupt business partners.

3163,2020-06-30 09:14:34,hijrew,Shane seems to be someone who ignores red flags and doesn’t do proper research. I noticed this in his conspiracy and spooky videos where he had blatant plot holes or errors and misinformation. I didn’t think much of it because it was entertainment. For people he overlooks hugeeee red flags and makes excuses. He clearly easily believes everything and fell for Jeffree’s guise and now he’s screwed.

3165,2020-06-30 09:17:32,hijrew,"Yup. Another thing I found quite. ""I'm like a little kid who believes everything"" about Shane is his Jake Paul series when he brings in a therapist-or whatever she was-when she didn't even have the right knowledge to diagnose Jake as a ""sociopath."" I'm no fan of Jake Paul and never will be, but bringing in an unprofessional therapist to just say right off the bat that Jake is a sociopath is ridiculous."

3167,2020-06-30 09:18:27,hijrew,"Agreed. He just doesn’t fact check anything at all. With a topic as serious as mental health and being someone who deals w it, I don’t see how he does that shit."

3170,2020-06-30 09:20:03,hijrew,"Same. He's just getting annoying with how he doesn't fact check things. It's not hard to find reliable websites and dig a little deeper. If he wants to be the dude who creates documentaries, then he needs to do research."
3171,2020-06-30 09:20:59,hijrew,"At this point I don’t see what he’s getting out of defending and standing by Jeffree anymore. It seems to be a lot more trouble than it’s worth. I believe there’s a high chance people wouldn’t have resurfaced all his problematic content if this Dramageddon shit didn’t start again (not that I excuse his problematic content, it disgusts me). My speculation is Jeffree might have shit on him, or even if he doesn’t Shane knows he can ruin people."

If he/she wants to educate it needed to be done tastefully and he completely ruined that. It was just not handled well and it’s not Eugenias fault at all. I just don’t see why he needed to do all that and then never speak of her again. Like what’s the fucking point.
3179,2020-06-30 09:31:26,hijrew,"Exactly, and then when he came to her house for some reason it looked like she didn't expect it. Like she immediately got a camera in her face the second she opened the door. And honestly I don't remember if Eugenia and Shane were friends back then so I'm confused. Why was he obsessed with her all of the sudden?"
3180,2020-06-30 09:31:58,hijrew,No clue. I think it’s honestly his whole saviour complex that’s been rising.
3181,2020-06-30 09:32:57,hijrew,Probably. The only person I find genuinely good when it comes to mental health on YouTube or docuseries's is Anthony Padilla. He's never biased and always is very respectful and generous.
3182,2020-06-30 09:33:45,hijrew,Shane shouldve just worked on making that horror movie instead of diving into this world of unverified docuseries. It fucked him over.
3183,2020-06-30 09:35:16,hijrew,Exactly. I just can't deal with the docuseries shit. I miss spooky boys :(
3184,2020-06-30 09:36:41,hijrew,Sad to see none of it is gonna come back. I wanted to see a light at the end of this tunnel. But there isn’t one. He’s finished.
3185,2020-06-30 09:37:45,hijrew,"It's sad honestly. I was really hoping he would redeem himself in some type of way, but this just proves my point. Big youtubers fall off the handle eventually."
3186,2020-06-30 09:38:17,hijrew,Scared to see what’ll happen next tbh. It’s gotten do far and so serious. It’s literally not tea or drama this is just bad.
3187,2020-06-30 09:39:55,hijrew,"Yup. It stopped being tea when I found out that Shane tried to justify pedophilia. It stopped being drama when he made an apology video and tried technically distancing himself saying. ""I hate that person, I hate that person"" that person is YOU Shane, actually take accountability because that's just embarrassing. It's now just utter shit."
3188,2020-06-30 09:40:29,hijrew,I want him to be better but like he’s just not. He’s straight up not taking accountability and I don’t understand the reason at all.
3189,2020-06-30 09:41:48,hijrew,"Exactly. It's not even about taking accountability at this point, it's about just honestly leaving YouTube and going to JAIL. He tried to justify pedophilia as I said and pretended to jack off to an 11 year old... seriously what the actual flying fuck."
3190,2020-06-30 09:42:08,hijrew,I really wonder what’s happening in that house rn...
3191,2020-06-30 09:42:55,hijrew,Trust me I do too. I don't understand how Ryland and Andrew are still stanning him and are on his side. It's disgusting.
3192,2020-06-30 09:44:06,hijrew,I wouldn’t be surprised if Andrew dips tbh. Things have gotten so bad and it’s not like he can really have a career w Shane anymore. As for Ryland we’ll see tbh since they are to be married. But this will seriously hurt Ryland idek how they’ll have kids with all this in the news now.
3193,2020-06-30 09:45:42,hijrew,"I know that certain adoption centres, knowing Shane's past, won't allow him to adopt children. Mainly because kids pick up easily on their legal guardians behaviours, and if Shane is acting like this, that child he adopts will be an ignorant little shit. I hope Andrew dips."
3194,2020-06-30 09:46:18,hijrew,Dude it’s bad like. Not even an in depth background check will be necessary. Googling him now comes up w pedophilia...
3195,2020-06-30 09:47:36,hijrew,"Exactly. And going to his Twitter all his comments are just saying he's a pedophile and fans that met him when they were minors have said he did some weird shit. Like one of them said he pulled her hair aggressively and said. ""I like your hair"""
3196,2020-06-30 09:48:02,hijrew,Oh ew. Just ew. Idk what to say anymore dude. It’s just horrifying.
3197,2020-06-30 09:49:06,hijrew,For real. It's getting scary. Someone we liked and looked up to turned out to be this freak. I won't be surprised if his fucking jail record pops up saying he's been in jail before.
3198,2020-06-30 09:49:44,hijrew,"I don’t get why famous people have to be problematic lol, just don’t be creep/asshole and you’ll be fine."
3199,2020-06-30 09:50:18,hijrew,P R E A C H. It's not hard like... just leave kids alone man 😭
3200,2020-06-30 09:50:52,hijrew,His content that wasn’t problematic did well bruh Idk why he had to pull all this shit. I was rooting for him.
3201,2020-06-30 09:51:27,hijrew,The content that was just simple and funny was amazing. This whole docuseries shit is not only boring but causes drama.
3202,2020-06-30 09:51:41,hijrew,It’s also just like lies too
3203,2020-06-30 09:51:55,hijrew,Yeah it's not even factual.
3204,2020-06-30 09:52:20,hijrew,I’ll be honest it literally boggles my bind how a grown ass man is so...uninformed?
3205,2020-06-30 09:53:26,hijrew,"OMG IKR! I'm just like. ""Dude come on you are 30! How are you this uneducated?"""

Jeffree Star and Blair white are just two sides of the same coin and I’m not convinced the whole video wasn’t contrived to take the heat off Shane and bring up these unfounded claims about James all over again.

If a victim decides they have the strength to come forward and talk about whatever their experience was with James, I’ll believe them.   Until then, it feels icky to me to crucify James all over again on the word of two problematic people who both have track records of manipulative behavior and lying."
3209,2020-06-30 09:09:02,hijjma,No. There’s no reason for him to give it any credibility and any lawyer would tell him not to say anything.
3210,2020-06-30 08:57:01,hijjma,"If I were him, I’d sue Jeffree for defamation of character."
3211,2020-06-30 08:50:38,hijjma,better if he doesn't imo... there's no actual physical evidence. and i'm not asking them to out a victim and i'm not siding with james as i don't particularly like him but going to the police is better. anything behind the scenes. just don't do it on youtube or any other public platform
3212,2020-06-30 08:51:59,hijjma,Probably doubtful he’d bring attention to it one way or the other - especially since Blaire has yet to produce any solid receipts.

3236,2020-06-30 06:15:57,hihj89,both years lebron did it he also led his team in assists
3237,2020-06-30 06:13:49,hihj89,Why are you including guards and forwards like they’re expected to lead the team in rebounds and blocks
3238,2020-06-30 06:26:03,hihj89,Lol I get tired of seeing people say dirk was never athletic or dirk was never a good defender but they tend to forget about his early years in the nba.

3240,2020-06-30 18:07:10,hihj89,"Wade was such a good shot blocker that I needed to see if he did it. 

He lead four categories in 2008-2009: Points, Assist, Steals, and Blocks. Pretty impressive for a Guard."

3255,2020-06-30 06:15:41,hihj89,"Because Dirk is a Forward and some other Forwards have done it, and because Kidd/Westbrook are outliers at the Guard position who had the potential to do it and came somewhat close."
3256,2020-06-30 06:33:44,hihj89,"All that does is oust them as talking out of their rear ends, don't worry about that crap. Dirk was incredibly mobile and agile, the epitome of a matchup nightmare as a 7-foot Swingman.

E: And he just barely missed a second submission in '03-'04. Led in Points, Steals, and Blocks. He was 14 rebounds behind 1st place (Antoine Walker), literally one game. Dirk played 77 games while Toine played all 82."
3257,2020-06-30 07:32:42,hihj89,Steals and blocks don't make someone a good defender

3259,2020-06-30 18:16:53,hihj89,"Right? I wouldn't be surprised at all if he somehow did this. I might do another post with Points Assists, Steals and Blocks if enough are interested in seeing it."
3260,2020-06-30 06:10:48,hihj89,"Wow, I hope he pulls it off. I'll have to check his NOLA years, he may have done it before.

E: Turns out he did it in '13-'14. Added, thanks!"
3261,2020-06-30 06:17:26,hihj89,maybe. he's not doing it right now tho. he's 200 points behind
3262,2020-06-30 07:49:43,hihj89,"'97-'98, '98-'99, '01-'02, '02-'03, '03-'04, and '06-'07. Just a typo, thanks."
3263,2020-07-01 00:31:55,hihj89,"League wide he was 10th in scoring, 4th in defensive rebounding, 3rd in win shares.

Among Forwards/Centers, he was 1st in threes, 1st in free throws made, 4th in assists, 2nd in steals, 17th in blocks, 2nd in points, 5th in 3p%, 1st in TS%.

I'd say that's pretty impressive. Especially since guys like Duncan, Shaq, KD, Pau Gasol, Yao, Amare, etc. have never done it."
3264,2020-06-30 16:53:51,hihj89,"Huh? He played with Shawn Bradley, Dennis Rodman, Juwan Howard, Raef Lafrentz, Antoine Walker, Erick Dampier, Desagana Diop, Brendan Haywood, Drew Gooden, Tyson Chandler, Ian Mahinmi, Brandan Wright, Elton Brand, Chris Kayman, Samuel Dalembert, Dejuan Blair, Amar'e Stoudemire, Zaza Pachulia, David Lee, Dwight Powell, JaVale McGee, Salah Mejri, Andrew Bogut, Nerlens Noel, Maxi Kleiber, and DeAndre Jordan.\

He's an all-time Defensive Rebounder. Never got Offensive Rebounds due to spreading the floor as a revolutionary, game-changing big man."
3265,2020-06-30 10:11:11,hihj89,"As a Pels fan I'm fine with where we're at now with the current young core, but man I wish I could see what would happen in an alternate universe where Boogie stays healthy and we keep the Boogie & The Brow experiment going."
3266,2020-06-30 06:39:08,hihj89,I should’ve specified small forwards. I don’t think a small forward has ever led the league in rebounds. Also i doubt Westbrook and Kidd came close to leading their team in blocks
3267,2020-06-30 06:44:43,hihj89,"I think he would be even better today, especially since he was a really good 3p shooter. A better version of KAT maybe."
3268,2020-06-30 07:01:12,hihj89,"Up until 2011 Dirk was also a capable defender, never lockdown and he never really cared that much about that side of the ball because he was mostly solo lifting the offense, but if you rewatch the 2011 finals the Heat never attacked him specifically and he made some clutch defensive plays down the stretch especially in game 4-6. 

After 2011 he was injured and by that point he became a liability, sadly most young guys only remember grandpa Dirk."
3269,2020-06-30 08:29:08,hihj89,Not necessarily. But the combination of Defensive Rebounds + Stocks is definitely a good signifier overall.
3270,2020-06-30 14:38:50,hihj89,He’s still a damn beast!!!
3271,2020-07-01 01:11:41,hihj89,"Those are things you didn't include in your post. I didn't say Dirk isn't impressive, I said the OP isn't that impressive."
3272,2020-06-30 16:25:24,hihj89,I was looking at his game logs earlier.... MF had a 40/20/10 triple double in NOLA.... I don’t think anyone in modern NBA (1980-now) has done that except him.... I miss that 5apg boogie :(
3273,2020-06-30 07:06:17,hihj89,"This isn't about leading the league overall in anything though. It's for a team in a single season. Just out of who I looked at during Dirk's era, LeBron did it. Marion/AK47/Millsap were SF/PF hybrids as well. 

As for Westbrook, he put up 31 pts/10 rbs with 1.6 stls /.4 blks while playing 81 games. So he hit 3/4 criteria and then had a chance since he played heavy minutes and only missed one game. This just so happened to coincide with a healthy season by all of the defensive specialists on the team.

Kidd wasn't as close, but he was the other triple double machine that played during Dirk's era so I figured he warranted inclusion. 

Also, this era included two lockout shortened seasons where anything can happen. Kidd came his closest in '98-'99 leading in Points, Rebounds, and Steals. LeBron came really close to a third submission in '11-'12."
3274,2020-06-30 07:42:44,hihj89,"He'd be the best small ball 5 in the league imo. I could see him putting up 30 ppg+ on 50/40/90. 

From 2000 to 2012 he averaged 24 ppg on just 17 shots per game and only 3.2 three pointers per game. Think of what he would be doing with 22-25 shots per game and 7-10 threes nowadays.

&nbsp;

He only shot 20+ FGA per game in *one* season in his entire career (19.9 rounded up). In comparison, during his era of '98-'19, look at how many seasons other players had:

- Kobe - 13 times
- Iverson - 9 times
- LeBron - 7 times
- T-Mac - 7 times
- Carmelo, V. Carter - 5 times
- Webber, Westbrook - 4 times
- A. Walker - 3 times
- LMA, Arenas, Durant, Harden - 2 times

&nbsp;

Here's 23+ FGA:

- Iverson - 7 times
- Kobe - 3 times
- T-Mac - 2 times
- Harden/LBJ/Stackhouse/Webber/Westbrook - 1 time

&nbsp;

25+ FGA:

- Iverson - 3 times
- Kobe - 1 time

&nbsp;

Dirk might have a Scoring Title(s) if he was getting 23-25+ FGA per game. And how much higher would he be on the All-Time Scoring List? Passed Jordan easily for at least 5th."
3275,2020-06-30 07:27:56,hihj89,"Sure was. His team defense stayed solid quite a bit longer than his man to man defense, and he was always great at slapping and poking the ball away when guys would try and drive into him. 

His athletic peak from about 2000 to 2003 (pre-knee injury against the Spurs in the 2003 WCF), he was as fast as a guard in the open court and off the dribble. He torched Scottie Pippen/Rasheed Wallace in the 2003 WCR1 w/ a 46/10/2 and 42/10/3 game. He obliterated Kevin Garnett in the 2002 WCR1 the year prior averaging 33/16 w/ 4.2 stocks. Back to back 33-point games against Stockton/Malone Jazz in the 2000 WCR1 the year before that. 42/18 w/ 6 steals against Tim Duncan and the Spurs in the 2000 WCSF. 

Hell, he's got career highs of 9 steals and 7 blocks."
3276,2020-06-30 08:47:58,hihj89,Not really. Andre Drummond and Hassan Whiteside are horrible on D.
3277,2020-07-01 01:13:14,hihj89,"You don't think that Dirk leading the '01-'02 Mavs in points, rebounds, steals, and blocks is impressive? When guys like Duncan, Shaq, KD, Pau Gasol, Yao, Amar'e, etc. never did it for their respective teams?"
3278,2020-06-30 07:12:21,hihj89,Ok that makes more sense. Great name btw
3279,2020-06-30 09:36:34,hihj89,"Hassan is a terrible example considering he's never averaged even 1 SPG. 

Dre has led the league in Defensive Win Shares and Defensive Rating twice each. He's not as bad as you're making him out to be. He's not great, but he's certainly not bad. He's a huge body, his defensive rebounding is all-time, and he gets quite a few stocks from camping the paint. His mentality could be way better, but let's not act like Detroit is some defensive powerhouse. He can't do everything when his guards are matadors.

He led all Centers last year in deflections with 225, 6th overall. - [source](https://stats.nba.com/players/hustle/?Season=2018-19&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&sort=DEFLECTIONS&dir=1&PerMode=Totals&PlayerPosition=C)

He's fourth in the entire league this year in deflections - [source](https://stats.nba.com/players/hustle/?Season=2019-20&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&sort=DEFLECTIONS&dir=1&PerMode=Totals)

He's seventh of all Centers in Player Opponent Field Goal % from 5-9 feet from the basket - [source](https://stats.nba.com/players/opponent-shooting/?sort=5-9%20ft.%20FG%20PCT&dir=-1&Season=2019-20&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&PlayerPosition=C&CF=5-9%20ft.%20FG%20PCT*LE*40:5-9%20ft.%20FGA*G*5) As good as Bam Adebayo, and better than Anthony Davis, Myles Turner, Marc Gasol, etc.

He's making strides defensively for sure."
3280,2020-07-01 01:18:52,hihj89,"No because look at what he actually did. I don't find getting 1bpg impressive, I don't find getting 1spg impressive, and I don't find getting 10rpg impressive. The combination doesn't wow me either. There are over 150 seasons of that same statistical bar, Dirk just so happened to be surrounded by shitty rebounders, stealers, and shot blockers. I'm not crediting him for that. 

Besides, you even had to use totals and not per-game production since there were guys who had him beat per game, but just didn't play in as many as Dirk."
3281,2020-07-01 01:37:13,hihj89,"From 2000-2009 (Dirk's athletic prime) only one guy matched his PPG, SPG, and BPG - Dwyane Wade. If you add in his RPG, he's the only guy that did it. I had to lower the thresholds by 4 PPG and 5 RPG to find anyone else, and it was none other than KG and Webber, another two all-time PFs.

If it wasn't impressive, tons of players would have done it during his era. And they didn't. So you can *feel* like it's not great, but that's not true."
3282,2020-07-01 02:04:39,hihj89,"That's cool maybe sorta, but, again, that's not the stat presented in the OP"
3283,2020-07-01 02:08:17,hihj89,Sure it is. Please refer to both the short excerpt above the Stat Totals for the 2001-2002 Mavericks and below it within the bulleted list.

3285,2020-06-29 23:20:43,hib683,"Read some unbiased reviews on it (reviews solely on the product and not the person affiliated with the product).  You'll find that Morphe products are of low quality, they don't blend well and are chalky.  You will find better rainbow palettes elsewhere, like the Urban Decay born to run palette, or something that's a roadshop brand, NYX 16 shadow pallete (brights).

If you're not sure you'll use all the shadows, maybe build your own palette with colourpop or MAC.  I'd prefer MAC as colourpop often discontinues certain shades, so if you find something you like, it could be gone when you need a replacement."
3286,2020-06-29 23:25:03,hib683,There’s a lot of repeat shades that will look the same on the eyes even if they look different in the pan. It’s a bulky palette which can be hard to use and Morphe formulas can be hit or miss. I think it could be better to find a palette that has dedicated rainbow shades. It’d be a better value and you could save some space
3287,2020-06-30 01:25:05,hib683,"Morphe is a mediocre brand with mediocre products. Their eyeshadows are chalky and don’t apply well. But they collab with popular problematic influencers and that’s why they are popular. But on a product level, I highly suggest looking at other brands such as Urban Decay (Born to run palette), Melt Cosmetics, ABH (some palettes), OPV, Juvias place. Etc"
3288,2020-06-29 23:17:12,hib683,"Id definitely reccomend building your own colourpop palette instead, I have the James charles palette and I think it can be little but difficult to work with, I'm not super talented with my makeup so here's an opinion from someone who does colourful but super basic looks, an byop is pretty affordable and you can pick your colours so you won't end up with colours you don't use"
3289,2020-06-30 00:52:52,hib683,Watch reviews from smaller YouTubers. I feel they’d be less inclined to lie. Also ask yourself how many colours will you ACTUALLY use. I bought the 35H palette cos of all the colours thinking I’d use them all but in reality I’m only using 6 colours. I’m regretting buying it cos as a tan person I can only use so many shades. I feel you’re better off making your own palette with better pigmented shadows (cos their shadows really lack) or just find an overall better palette.. PS I suggest trying Lorac Neon Lights PRO
3290,2020-06-29 23:53:14,hib683,"I actually went through this same situation a few weeks ago! I’ve narrowed down my collection but did not have any sort of colored shadows, just a bunch of neutrals. I researched and looked around for a bunch of rainbow palettes that suit my needs, which is just like you described. I didn’t want to buy a huge 35 pan palette just to use the rainbow colors only. I found the smashbox cover shot bold palette (which is still on sale on their site, although I can’t link on this sub). It’s small, just the colors I need and actually great quality. 

I tried to look at the colourpop and Mac build-a-palettes but it’s just overwhelming to me. When I checked, there were a few shades out of stock or they didn’t exactly have the ROYGBIV colors I was looking for. I haven’t bought any new makeup in a loooooong time and actually don’t feel bad this time because it’s something I don’t already have!"
3291,2020-06-30 02:12:31,hib683,"Certifeye is a UK indie brand that is known for color.  While the palette I have of theirs is not rainbow (it is a blue/green one), I know they have a rainbow one.

I've never tried Morphe (I HATE how they make shades I'll never wear like orange large) but I know there's a lot of good indie brands that have rainbow palettes.  Amy Loves Makeup on YouTube just did a video about her rainbow palettes."
3292,2020-06-30 01:07:22,hib683,Hi There.  I have absolutely zero affiliation to this company:  [Karity](https://www.karity.com/) I found them in their first year of business and I ordered 9 different shadows to form my own palette. All of their singles are highly pigmented and easy to blend. I always wait for the sales - like when they’re 2 and 3 dollars a piece...I’ve not tried their individual palettes but they look gorgeous and I assume the formulation is the same.
3293,2020-06-29 23:34:10,hib683,"Thank you so much! Sadly, I already tried the Nyx brights palette and they turned put extremely chalky for me. All but two shades don't really show up on my primed eye (even used the nyx eye primer!), no matter how much I pack or blend.

As for the Mac palette, it's over my price range for the small amout of different shades you get. Also, they don't seem to have many ""popping"" colors, so it wouldn't even be all of the shades I would have wanted. I have already looked into color pop just now, and I'd say that would be the closest to building my perfect palette with the money I'm willing to spend while having the max amount of different shades possible. Sadly many of the ones I'd want are out of stock :(

But definitely a huge thank you for helping!"
3294,2020-06-30 02:49:40,hib683,"I've heard Melt is really hit-or-miss, too. I haven't tried their eyeshadow, but I have 3 lip products from them and even *that* purchase runs the gamut from ""I love this"" to ""I've never been more disappointed in a lipstick""."
3295,2020-06-29 23:20:40,hib683,"Oh that's really cool! I never really looked into color pop since I thought it was really expensive. Do you happen to know if they also ship to central Europe? I'll go check them out now, thanks!"
3296,2020-06-30 03:16:30,hib683,Hi there.  Please take note that linking out to product sites is not allowed here at MUR.  Thanks
3297,2020-06-30 01:21:27,hib683,Colourpop has very affordable build your own pallettes. They're currently off their website atm due to covid 19 and them running out of stock but it's like 40$ cad for like 30 shares or 40 I think so it's pretty good
3298,2020-06-30 02:53:12,hib683,"I haven’t tried their lip products, but I hear their eyeshadows are great. And they have really good colour stories. I was thinking of picking up the Smoke sessions and Gemini palettes"
3299,2020-06-30 00:30:55,hib683,I'm pretty sure they ship world wide :)
3300,2020-06-30 03:00:55,hib683,"Their palettes seem to be pretty well pigmented, but I was once talked out of a stack from them because the shade I really wanted was more like a sheer topper and hard to work with, according to someone who had it. Definitely poke around reviews and/or ask about them to get a feel for the consistency (or potential lack thereof)."
3301,2020-06-30 03:01:56,hib683,Will do! Thanks

As for you, No Soul... I’m not sure why you chose to post this here. And I know you don’t care anymore, but I’m sorry about what happened to you."

3307,2020-06-29 21:46:10,hi98iy,"I was expecting Sean to be the apprentice, or maybe Izzy. I thought Ebony was probably going to live and have her memory wiped, not become the apprentice. It makes sense though, she does act kind of like how I would think a no soul would act."
3308,2020-06-29 22:33:27,hi98iy,"And so this is what it has come down to. Congratulations Ebony, or whatever you wish to call yourself now. By looking at other comments I’ll say No Soul for now.
I do offer my condolences to the loss of Izzy, Robin, Sofia, Alex, Liam, Jerel, and the many others that died, except for Daniel, Derrick, and Timothy. They can burn in Hell."
3309,2020-06-30 02:11:39,hi98iy,"Oh. No offense but I truly wanted Izzy to take it. Saddened by that loss; gotta say that I truly didn't see this coming. At the very least, I'm relieved you keep up with Sean. Izzy and Alex would've truly wanted that & your efforts to stay away from the darkness and keep your light are very admirable & I def acknowledge that. 

Tbh even if Sean survived, it's best that he doesn't remember that horrible hallway of blood. I'm glad he stayed safe. Well. Take care, okay? (I don't mean to sound rude but I know you're otherwise okay & can focus on your studies) Oh, I'm also glad you got your ear back. ❤"

I am glad that Izzy lost because she threw away her chance to live, but i wish she had just taken the chance to leave and Shaun had died. Oh well. Ebony winning wasn't my first pick but I'm pretty happy with the result. Great read, im always ready to devour a new death game in any medium"
3314,2020-06-30 02:07:16,hi98iy,"Well, I had hoped to find that you would find a way to get out of this with the other students. To be honest, I don't really know if I should congratulate you or be shocked at this, Ebony. You know, all things have to die eventually. Immortality won't matter when the No Souls eventually collapse."

3317,2020-06-30 12:08:10,hi98iy,"Greetings, No Soul. I have but a mere question for you. Is there any chance that you or any of the other No Souls will select anyone of my Bloodline as your apprentice? I wish to know this knowledge in hopes of preparing them."
3318,2020-06-30 14:28:05,hi98iy,This whole thing was probably the first post on here to make me cry. I just keep thinking about my little brothers... I would never want them to endure anything like this. I suppose this means the way in which this was told is very gripping.

"" I am not Izzy. But, that does not necessarily mean what you may think it  means – I am not any of the others, either. When one joins the No Souls  as an apprentice, one experiences a form of rebirth. """

They were on a different plane of existence from reality & the teacher seemed to read minds so it had to end for sure. Still, I seriously thought it'd be Izzy. I wanted it to be and was shocked so bad when I realized it was Ebony.

Poor Izzy. I guess the magic rendered her out of existence/dead as soon as you reached the end. I hope...it didn't hurt much/at all. :( I truly thought Izzy would win after Sean was the no memory kid."

My prediction is that the “future” you see is part of the fate of the universe we live in, and that the reason you can both see and alter it to something different is because you came from outside our universe.

3387,2020-06-29 20:18:29,hi7fvw,Either donate it or recycle it. Burning it is and filming you destroying it is a childish move.
3388,2020-06-29 20:56:16,hi7fvw,"keep it and search for receipts?

or throw it away  if you want, it's not  Fahrenheit 451 lol"
3389,2020-06-29 20:01:52,hi7fvw,Donate it? There can be a million copies of his books next to the million copies of 50 Shades Of Grey
3390,2020-06-29 20:25:06,hi7fvw,Throw it away. I would say donate it but I doubt someone wants to read a Shane Dawson book.
3391,2020-06-29 21:18:45,hi7fvw,"You could always use it to do some sort of craft like black out poetry or paper maché. Or kindling for non fire if you really wanted to. I don’t think it’s childish if you want to destroy it, depending on how you feel about the situation as a whole I could be cathartic. 

But unceremoniously tossing it in the recycling box (rather than the trash) would be fitting."
3392,2020-06-29 20:12:42,hi7fvw,"Stupid and childish, just like the ones who took part in the JC pallet crap. Just donate it or throw it away."
3393,2020-06-30 00:35:08,hi7fvw,"Either way you still spent the money so burning it is extra and stupid and I felt the same when people were destroying the James Charles palette (Especially in light of new information this year) and  throwing it away a waste, just recycle it. Or if youre crafty use it for paper mache or something."
3394,2020-06-29 21:03:44,hi7fvw,"You can sell it on eBay, or just save it. It’ll probably be worth more money in the future?"

3396,2020-06-29 22:44:50,hi7fvw,Kindling for a bbq. LOL jk. Donate or recycle.
3397,2020-06-29 23:02:22,hi7fvw,Keep it til winter and you can burn it for warmth.
3398,2020-06-30 03:08:50,hi7fvw,"Use it for a crafts project to recycle it into something good, fyi i dont know if your area is accepting recycling so i would look into that before trying to"

3402,2020-06-29 20:37:23,hi7fvw,I agree.
3403,2020-06-29 20:39:05,hi7fvw,Yeah I def don’t want to donate it because I don’t want to put something of his back out where people can buy it in support of him.
3404,2020-06-29 21:22:43,hi7fvw,Yeah the only reason to why I wanted to to destroy it and maybe make a video of it was to show that I’m done with him and I don’t support him anymore at all because if I’m willing to destroy something I got in support of him it would kinda show that it’s not childish but I dunno. The black out poetry is a good idea too n
3405,2020-06-29 20:37:10,hi7fvw,Yeah that’s what I was thinking it’s more childish than making a statement.
3406,2020-06-29 20:51:29,hi7fvw,"The money is already spent so, it wouldn't be in any financial support of him, it would be in support of wherever you donate it to"
3407,2020-06-29 19:25:21,hi6lvc,"I think no one is talking about it because she didn’t provide actual proof. Her video was mostly speculation albeit very serious speculation. So unless a victim decides to come forward it’s not really provable at this time. I 100% think Jeffree holds dirt on people as a means of manipulation and control,  however it’s hearsay unless people come forward which is their right not to do."
3408,2020-06-29 19:52:08,hi6lvc,[deleted]
3409,2020-06-29 20:03:36,hi6lvc,"J\* is not a credible character, first of all. He is also a well-know bully and blackmailer who has ""shit on everyone."" So, that alone makes me question why anyone, especially a youtuber who's a victim of another youtuber, would come to JEFFREY STAR with their proof of all people. Like wtaf?! Who in the right mind would go to him with something as big as this and something they feel scared to come forward publicly with?! It's a crazy idea. Who tf would *trust* *J\** I mean what.

And would J\* really care about the victim's desire to be anon? Only insofar it served his own agenda. Which I don't see how it does, in this case? He wanted to destroy JC's career and coming forward with actual evidence would've done that. Remember, J\* dgaf about who he hurts or steps on.

As for this video, idk who this girl is but she sat there and provided no actual proof of anything. Voice memos can be faked, so unless an actual victim steps forward it's just baseless.

Sidenote, I'm not a fan of JC and dislike him but lbr here for a sec, there is zero proof."
3410,2020-06-29 20:20:39,hi6lvc,"Because it’s third party proof , where the second and third party are *famously* not credible. It’s unfortunate, but, if the alleged victim wanted people to cancel James over it, he’ll likely have to be the one to say “hey, this happened”."
3411,2020-06-29 20:19:59,hi6lvc,"My hot take is that Jeffree may have fabricated the voicemail in order to control her/manipulate. If he had this info since Drammageddon he would've used it. But he didn't after James made his video even after Jeffree claimed he had a ton of dirt against James and made promises to expose him at the time. He technically had nothing on James after his video was uploaded and he explained himself. I feel like after a whole year he still can't get over how James wasn't as ""punished"" as Manny and other people were (losing support to the point of obscurity) and is now just pulling strings to get the final word. This man is obsessed with James Charles."
3412,2020-06-29 19:57:03,hi6lvc,"2020 has taught me so many things. What a year!

My thoughts are throw away Youtube at this point."
3413,2020-06-29 20:29:58,hi6lvc,"I think Blaire believes it’s true.  And I think it’s a possibility.  But I don’t think we, as the audience, have enough information to decide if it’s true or not.  

I’m annoyed that she is telling us it’s true but then doesn’t tell us the name of the other Youtuber who sexually assaulted someone.  She says she believes that one is also credible.  That’s why I’m leaning towards her having a bias against JC, at the very least.  She’s not trying to protect the community from predators, she just wants to tear JC down.  If she wanted to protect the community, she’d name the other one.  

If she specifically only wanted to come after Jeffree she didn’t have to say she believes that voice memo to be true she could’ve just said “I don’t want to publicly speculate on the veracity, I just want to tell you all how terrible it is that Jeffree is doing this.”

So I think she has other motives than she says but I do think she believes it’s true.  That doesn’t mean it is true, though."
3414,2020-06-30 00:39:28,hi6lvc,Idk this shit really rubs me the wrong way. There was never actually any proof shown and it makes me sick to my stomach to think about a possible traumatic crime being treated as tea and drama. And it’s gross seeing people speculate on who the victim could be.
3415,2020-06-29 19:49:12,hi6lvc,"It's being largely ignored because tons of people are on James Charles side, even though he's done horrible things too."
3416,2020-06-29 21:05:16,hi6lvc,"I obviously don’t know the truth but honestly it always seemed weird to me how effortlessly people accused James of being a sexual predator. Like, James was a 19 year old virgin at the time of the dramageddon (he said so himself). it’s hard for me to imagine an adult man (as far as we know that’s who James is mostly into) feeling assaulted by a teenage guy with no sexual experience. What did James do to hurt someone in this way? Was it really so much different from things that literally most teenagers do? I mean things like flirting, trying to get someone to be interested in them - which I would say is a rather natural and common behavior and not a valid reason to call someone a predator. I don’t know tho, shit just doesn’t add up to me. Regardless, I really hope that the accusations are false and nobody actually got hurt."
3417,2020-06-30 21:46:51,hi6lvc,Last time I heard of blare she was a reactionary
3418,2020-06-29 19:29:07,hi6lvc,That’s a big reason why I think that Blaire definitely messed up by making this video. She brought up these allegations against James again with no proof and if James is innocent it once again reopens old wounds for him and puts out false info. I’m sure Jeffree is in his big mansion laughing at her that he got her to spread this info about James again. She could have made a similar video calling Jeffree out without bringing the allegations up.
3419,2020-06-29 20:19:15,hi6lvc,"Even if the voice memo becomes public, it will still only be an accusation."
3420,2020-06-29 20:14:00,hi6lvc,Yeah I agree that J* is shady for sure and it’s totally possible/probable he faked the voice memos and everything for clout. But that’s my big issue with Blaire making this video because it brings more credibility to those voice memos without providing any proof. It causes us to further speculate on an issue without any solid evidence.
3421,2020-06-29 20:28:03,hi6lvc,That’s why I think it was originally such a terrible thing that Jeffree spread this about James and why Blaire bringing it up once again with no proof was a terrible idea. Since there is no concrete proof why do these youtubers keep talking about it.
3422,2020-06-29 20:31:05,hi6lvc,The only counter argument I can make is that maybe Jeffree is actually being a good person and didn’t want to out the person who James allegedly assaulted and that’s why he didn’t release any of the dirt he had on him. But we all know Jeffree is a terrible person so I doubt that’s why and you’re probably right lol.
3423,2020-06-29 19:59:14,hi6lvc,Hahaha how about we get rid of all the drama and keep YouTube cause it’s my main source of entertainment at this point lol
3424,2020-06-29 20:41:32,hi6lvc,"All Blaire wanted to do was tear Jeffree down (understandable lol), but then in the process is making James look bad even though there has yet to be any credible proof released. She did not make this video for the right reasons and even though she is trying to seem like a hero for exposing Jeffree i just think she wants to seem like a hero."
3425,2020-06-29 20:00:18,hi6lvc,"other than the ebola joke, what other stuff has he done that’s been confirmed? I feel like i’m super out of the loop bc i don’t rly pay attention to him lol"
3426,2020-06-29 19:54:17,hi6lvc,"I can’t wait for the day when it’s revealed if this “secret info” Jeffree has is true or not, cause if it turns out to be true James does deserve to be called out for it. He is riding the wave of people liking him again, but if the allegations are credible then I hope people will see him for who he really is."
3427,2020-06-29 22:01:56,hi6lvc,I think it wasn’t that he was assaulting people per say but that he was trying to convince straight men to sleep with him and using his fame to do it or tricking them. I don’t think people are saying he’s a serial r*pist or anything just that he was coming on to people in a bad way and possibly touching them in a way that made them feel uncomfortable (this is just what I think people were accusing him of)
3428,2020-06-29 19:32:17,hi6lvc,I agree. Blair’s video was exactly what Jeffree’s tweets were last year empty information that can cause harm or damage from the nature of the insinuation. It’s not right. These are life ruining allegations.
3429,2020-06-29 20:25:42,hi6lvc,Very true! My hope is that when/if this voice memo is revealed the person involved can finally say if the allegations against James are real or not. But for now it’s all just hearsay.
3430,2020-06-29 20:29:08,hi6lvc,"I mean, sure the voice memos might be real and not faked but I just have trouble with believing this bc so far, everything we heard about this came straight from J\* and basically no one else. 

Even Blaire is going off of whatever thing/narrative J\* presented her with. That's not good enough. I want to hear from the actual victim. 

I do agree that Blaire's video is just adding more fuel to the fire without providing anything of actual substance. imo she shouldn't have made it and tbh I side-eye it a bit also bc it seems like she sat on this info for a moment and did nothing but suddenly, when this whole drama blows up she makes a video? Seems like it's geared more for attention and views and to also wash her hands off the situation in case any real evidence/victim do come forward later she can say, ""I told you, I did my best, I'm not to blame.""

Very self-serving."
3431,2020-06-29 21:04:51,hi6lvc,I feel like if he had it at the time he would at least hint it in some way. Holding onto the info for blackmail purposes is demonic.
3432,2020-06-29 20:27:20,hi6lvc,"Unless it's been made public by the accuser, it should never be made public."
3433,2020-06-29 20:33:52,hi6lvc,Blaire White is the epitome of self serving so I’m sure she just wanted to get ahead of everything and try and make herself the hero
3434,2020-06-29 21:58:59,hi6lvc,If anyone’s demonic it’s Jeffree Star
3435,2020-06-29 20:31:57,hi6lvc,100%

3459,2020-06-29 19:26:31,hi6fs6,Great list!!! Almost identical to my own
3460,2020-06-29 19:17:29,hi6fs6,They call him Demar DePression for a reason.

3464,2020-06-29 19:19:34,hi6fs6,It’s not bait that’s my opinion. He had one of the greatest seasons of all time in 16-17 and it’s been completely swept under the rug due to what’s happened since
3465,2020-06-29 20:34:44,hi6fs6,"Nope, it’s not"
3466,2020-06-29 19:15:52,hi6fs6,No not really. I’m just not afraid to differentiate from the norm

3471,2020-06-29 19:20:33,hi6fs6,Oh there was plenty more I just loved that bit coupled with the fact they don't have Zeke Thomas on the list.
3472,2020-06-29 19:22:38,hi6fs6,Okay yes he had one great season ill give you that (one of the greatest of all time is a stretch) but how is he better than Steve Nash? That's without getting any the other logical absurdities in this list.
3473,2020-06-29 19:16:55,hi6fs6,"> I’m just not afraid to differentiate from the norm

That's a really eloquent way of saying, I'm a dumbass and have dumb opinions."
3474,2020-06-29 19:16:49,hi6fs6,Explain how Isaiah Thomas is better than Steve Nash
3475,2020-06-29 19:28:47,hi6fs6,"Thats fine, but some of these things you are saying I can't think of any half-decent evidence to back it up. Like some things are debatable or controversial like saying Westbrook ahead of Stockton, but then some things are just plain and simple stupid like Demar ahead of Garnett and Giannis."
3476,2020-06-29 19:48:39,hi6fs6,Cmon bro.
3477,2020-06-29 19:22:46,hi6fs6,Hahaha right? People forget just how good that dude was
3478,2020-06-29 19:23:25,hi6fs6,Nash didn’t score
3479,2020-06-29 19:25:12,hi6fs6,You know you have won a debate when your opponent insults your character and is unable to rebut any of your points
3480,2020-06-29 19:19:34,hi6fs6,"How about Demar fucking Derozan and Derrick Rose being higher than KG, Barkley, and Malone?

How about Steph being #2? 

How about Carmelo Anthony being one spot higher than Tim Duncan? 

How about Kevin Love being higher than Scottie Pippen? 

How about Manu Ginobli over Iverson? 

How about Kyrie being #15 in general?"
3481,2020-06-29 19:22:08,hi6fs6,"Steve Nash was a great player but he could never really score. In my opinion, while he was a great player and is worthy of this list, he didn’t deserve either of his mvps. Isaiah Thomas on the other hand had one of the greatest scoring seasons of all time and should have won mvp that year"
3482,2020-06-29 19:32:37,hi6fs6,"DeMar is by far the most disrespected player of this generation. He has had no help in Toronto and San Antonio. He put the Raptors on his back and carried them to the ECF. The only reason he could never win was because of LeBron greatness. Last year he dragged an even worse San Antonio squad into the playoffs and almost single handedly pulled off the upset against Denver. In my opinion, this puts him over Garnett who had a much better supporting cast in Boston."
3483,2020-06-29 19:49:47,hi6fs6,You shouldn’t have any problems with this as a Westbrook fan
3484,2020-06-29 19:25:38,hi6fs6,Is that the only criteria of the list? Also Nash definitely could score he often just sacrificed his onw ppg to set up others and to maximise his efficiency.
3485,2020-06-29 19:27:22,hi6fs6,Dude this entire thread is people refuting your points lol.
3486,2020-06-29 19:21:36,hi6fs6,"That's just the tip of the iceberg, there are so many more stupidities like WB 8th all time"
3487,2020-06-29 19:25:15,hi6fs6,Why are you doing this to yourself lol
3488,2020-06-30 04:39:57,hi6fs6,"KG also carried a terrible Minny team to the WCF which is further than Demar made it. Also a former MVP, 4x all nba, defense player of the year, and champion. What makes you think demar is better than him?"
3489,2020-06-29 19:39:14,hi6fs6,"Demar had great supporting cast. He had Kyle Lowry and the Raptors always had the best depth in the NBA. Yet he would consistently choke in the playoffs. Then in San Antonio, the previous season the Spurs without Demar (Kawhi was hurt the whole season) made the 7 seed, Demar comes in the next year, they improve by only one win and are still the 7 seed. KG is a top 10 defender in NBA history, he is a better shooter rebounder, finisher than Demar. He has an NBA championship. Boston wasn't the only place he played, he tokes some pretty trash TWolves teams far. KG is by far better."
3490,2020-06-29 19:50:12,hi6fs6,I do cuz I’m not bias lol. Westbrook is no where near 8
3491,2020-06-29 19:27:13,hi6fs6,Honestly seriously debated putting stoudemire in over him. It was close for sure
3492,2020-06-29 19:27:46,hi6fs6,I have yet to see you debate me
3493,2020-06-29 19:23:25,hi6fs6,"I mean it's top to bottom bad lol. 

I just keep uncovering absurdities and laughing my ass off. 

Like I just saw John Stockon at #46, and I'm rolling."
3494,2020-06-29 19:31:30,hi6fs6,Nash basically made Amare the player he was. You are entitled to your opinion mate we will just agree to disagree on so many things with this list.
3495,2020-06-29 19:32:11,hi6fs6,"Because there's no point. Where would that get me? You're obviously a clown that's either doing some galaxy-brain level trolling, or an actual moron who put forth the worst all-time list I think I've seen on this sub. 

Allow me to extend an olive branch. I'll just look at the bottom of your list. You have Steve Nash and Reggie Miller ranked below Boogie Cousins and CJ McCollum. This is an objectively bad opinion. Now take that same bad opinion, and apply it to the rest of the list. That's what I'm looking at."
3496,2020-06-29 19:33:25,hi6fs6,Ok fair enough glad you could respect my opinion
3497,2020-06-29 19:38:17,hi6fs6,"I’ll debate you on Cousins. Up until the Achilles injury derailed his career, he was one of the most dominant centers of all time. He was by far the best center in the league. He put up god like numbers but was constantly hampered by a lack of a supporting cast. Miller is one of the most overrated players of all time. No defense and is only on this list because he revolutionized the 3. Nash couldn’t score and didn’t deserve either of his mvps but is still one of the greats."
3498,2020-06-29 21:49:37,hi6445,Love **Anton** and **Roland**. Thank you for sharing this list!
3499,2020-06-30 00:56:36,hi6445,"Alexei Nemov didn't win any golds?  I always loved him lol.

I remember liking Paul and Morgan as a pair of names."
3500,2020-06-29 22:02:42,hi6445,You're welcome!
3501,2020-06-30 02:01:11,hi6445,"He did! This is just American medalists.

His medal record:

1996 - gold: team event, vault; silver: all-around; bronze: floor exercise, high bar, pommel horse

2000 - gold: all-around, high bar; silver: floor exercise; bronze: team event, pommel horse, parallel bars

Paul and Morgan is honestly a great twin set...not matchy-matchy, but they go together."
3502,2020-06-30 02:02:35,hi6445,"Geez, I should have read your title more clearly 🤦‍♀️ still an excellent list. I also remember liking Blaine's name too - I watched the hell out of that Olympics!"
3503,2020-06-30 02:12:08,hi6445,It's all good - it's a small mention in the title. Thank you! I loved the 2000 Olympics...I vividly remember the women's all-around having a too-short vault (which is dangerous as heck).

3505,2020-06-29 19:19:56,hi5ixv,Probably the most free headers I've ever seen in the box. Exeter's keeper should be beyond livid with this defense.
3506,2020-06-29 19:50:03,hi5ixv,Moxey you utter bellend
3507,2020-06-29 19:03:04,hi5ixv,UP THE SHOE ARMY!!!!
3508,2020-06-29 19:10:03,hi5ixv,Exeter's keeper has every right to be pissed off there how many headers are they losing in their own box
3509,2020-06-29 19:01:18,hi5ixv,"Ah fuck, League 2 KDB going off. Really important player for ntown."
3510,2020-06-29 19:10:25,hi5ixv,Couple of good stops from maxted
3511,2020-06-29 19:16:52,hi5ixv,Bowman mate what was that...
3512,2020-06-29 19:17:58,hi5ixv,"Maxted again, wow."
3513,2020-06-29 19:18:33,hi5ixv,Exeter getting rinsed in the air
3514,2020-06-29 19:41:49,hi5ixv,"I don't know why Moxey doesn't just twat it in from half way for old times sake.

EDIT: Not quite what I had in mind that."
3515,2020-06-29 19:50:18,hi5ixv,Well that's game over it's safe to say
3516,2020-06-29 18:57:33,hi5ixv,"Come on, you Cobblers!!!!"
3517,2020-06-29 19:02:20,hi5ixv,Yes you beautiful ginger bastard! Come back next season on loan again please
3518,2020-06-29 19:50:17,hi5ixv,Well that's fucked it a little more.
3519,2020-06-29 20:02:28,hi5ixv,Horrific giveaway but just lay it off fuck me
3520,2020-06-29 20:12:08,hi5ixv,"Killed that off, league one hear we come!"
3521,2020-06-29 19:17:38,hi5ixv,Bowman... come on
3522,2020-06-29 19:22:00,hi5ixv,This Max Teddybear guy is really good.
3523,2020-06-29 19:24:56,hi5ixv,If I were Maxted I'd be chewing out my teammates at halftime.
3524,2020-06-29 19:44:40,hi5ixv,Goode has been excellent
3525,2020-06-29 20:05:28,hi5ixv,Exeter showing an excellent example of self sabotage tonight
3526,2020-06-29 20:20:58,hi5ixv,It'll be a good one for Exeter if they win this
3527,2020-06-29 20:26:24,hi5ixv,Never switched back on after conceding the first goal sigh
3528,2020-06-29 18:29:04,hi5ixv,Hoping exeter finally get this one!
3529,2020-06-29 18:42:41,hi5ixv,Haha oh fucking hell that’s rough for Exeter
3530,2020-06-29 18:28:31,hi5ixv,LETS GO EXETER!
3531,2020-06-29 19:50:37,hi5ixv,Awful challenge
3532,2020-06-29 20:12:25,hi5ixv,I wanted an away trip to Exeter next season as it's boring to go to Northampton. Only way to avoid it would be winning the playoffs but that isn't happening.
3533,2020-06-29 18:37:24,hi5ixv,Really hope Exeter win. Not just because I’ve always liked them as a club but it would be horrible to lose 3 of the last 4 play-off finals!
3534,2020-06-29 18:46:36,hi5ixv,Pain.
3535,2020-06-29 18:53:10,hi5ixv,GK did get the ball first but Vadaine straight up caught a fist to the face.
3536,2020-06-29 19:02:56,hi5ixv,Gonna be a big ask for Exeter now.
3537,2020-06-29 19:23:20,hi5ixv,"first half to forget for ECFC.  Got to close down space and stop letting the crosses get in, and contest the headers in the box."
3538,2020-06-29 19:40:44,hi5ixv,"Bloody hell I can't sit still in my chair. Trying not to get carried away, we've lost 2-0 leads this season..."
3539,2020-06-29 20:19:56,hi5ixv,"Well, this is a hiding..."
3540,2020-06-29 20:20:06,hi5ixv,"Bloody hell Paul Anderson, thought he was retired or gone missing."
3541,2020-06-29 18:43:18,hi5ixv,That one hurts
3542,2020-06-29 19:03:46,hi5ixv,Poor Exeter
3543,2020-06-29 20:12:52,hi5ixv,Good time for a comeback...
3544,2020-06-29 19:57:39,hi5ixv,Last game in a City shirt. This is the worst we've played all season. Always bottle it at Wembley.
3545,2020-06-29 19:04:04,hi5ixv,Real shame been integral all season
3546,2020-06-29 19:17:27,hi5ixv,And another one! That would have been game over
3547,2020-06-29 19:18:11,hi5ixv,Not even getting the shot away there is shocking
3548,2020-06-29 20:06:28,hi5ixv,This is some real Monkey's Paw stuff
3549,2020-06-29 19:53:07,hi5ixv,"Nah, we're just lulling them into a false sense of security."
3550,2020-06-29 20:05:21,hi5ixv,I've seen hoskins finishing enough down the years to be ok with morton not squaring that
3551,2020-06-29 18:30:21,hi5ixv,Third times the charm!
3552,2020-06-29 18:43:17,hi5ixv,They really are cursed in play offs
3553,2020-06-29 19:53:47,hi5ixv,I'm pretty sure it went more or less as intended to be fair.
3554,2020-06-29 20:14:55,hi5ixv,I fancy a weekend away in Oxford. Will probably be a Tuesday night game though.
3555,2020-06-29 18:58:15,hi5ixv,Same for both teams believe it or not
3556,2020-06-29 18:59:57,hi5ixv,"What I thought too tbh. If that's two outfield players and an elbow to the face or sth while jumping for the ball, foul all day long"
3557,2020-06-29 19:04:57,hi5ixv,"It's fine, we'll catch them in the second leg."
3558,2020-06-29 19:45:24,hi5ixv,"Yeah we're not the best at sitting deep and holding on, so i hope keep the mentality right"
3559,2020-06-29 20:21:43,hi5ixv,Team switched off ages ago.
3560,2020-06-29 19:05:21,hi5ixv,"Gutted for him as well, he tried to play on but definitely needed to go off. Would have been nice for him to be on the pitch at the end though."
3561,2020-06-29 19:20:23,hi5ixv,"The guys getting a work out tonight.

Exeters defending on anything aerial has been really poor. Its no secret how we play at this point"
3562,2020-06-29 22:18:45,hi5ixv,"""just fooking square it!!!"" i heard. sorry sam but no"
3563,2020-06-29 18:32:15,hi5ixv,Certainly hope so!  Cardboard me is excited to see exeter and to attend a match at Wembly!
3564,2020-06-29 19:59:10,hi5ixv,"Don't doubt it. 

I can understand the frustration, but with his experience its inexcusable to be so stupid."
3565,2020-06-29 20:16:34,hi5ixv,"I mean it's handy having another away day so close, I just like going in a different direction which Exeter would have provided. Anything to avoid yet another away trip up the M6"
3566,2020-06-29 19:07:10,hi5ixv,"That replay was quite sad.

I'm hoping its that he knows his body well enough to know carrying on would be bad. Especially after the knee bother a couple of years ago"
3567,2020-06-29 20:17:28,hi5ixv,That is true. Was looking at a map of next season's L2 clubs and our closest games would have been Cambridge and Walsall. I'm based in Huntingdon so the former is fine with me but it's looking very northern.
3568,2020-06-29 20:19:09,hi5ixv,"Yeah, it feels exciting whenever our coaches don't head towards the North. I feel like I know the route past Stoke as well as a lorry driver there's so many teams up there."

3607,2020-06-29 17:57:09,hi2o22,That’s right cummy 😍😍😍
3608,2020-06-29 16:08:48,hi2o22,"Well, I was shopping in Walmart the other day, (with the intent of buying all of their guns, bacon and American flags) when I spotted a Mooslem running frantically up and down through the aisles, and his name was Abdul-Mohammed-Jamal-Jabar-Steve-Jabar-Omar-Abdul. I was certain at any moment he would yell 'Allah Akbar'. Thankfully, my shopping cart was full of bacon (which as you all know, is Mooslem kryptonite). So I straightened my MAGA hat and pulled up my Confederate flag britches and grabbed a pack of bacon from my cart. I took that Mooslem over my knee and spanked his ass with the bacon while screaming 'Liberalism is a mental disorder!' over and over. Then, by the power of the bacon,  Abdul-Mohammed-Jamal-Jabar-Steve-Jabar-Omar-Abdul instantly converted to Christianity and registered as a Republican. Trump showed up and awarded me the Medal of Honor because I probably stopped the next 9/11.

3616,2020-06-29 13:08:27,hhzi0m,"It wasn’t just 10 years ago tho. And there is way too many examples of awful things he’s done. And his apology was half ass. If he wants to be forgiving, he should at least be convincing"
3617,2020-06-29 13:59:13,hhzi0m,"He made a Trayvon Martin joke literally two years ago and since apologizing he has used his platform to save the careers of people who were also openly racist and had all been outed as toxic abusers. Beyond all of that there are way, way too many instances of him sexualizing children. It’s almost as if it’s the only way he can relate to them. I have seen too much now to let my own guilt for supporting him keep me from disavowing his behavior."
3618,2020-06-29 13:15:07,hhzi0m,[deleted]
3619,2020-06-29 14:39:42,hhzi0m,"I, respectfully, disagree.


I may be one of the ""older"" fans because I'm in my 20s, but black face wasnt funny back then. My parents didnt think it was funny, my teachers didnt think it was funny, no one over the age of 12 thought it was funny in the 2000's. 
Black face hasnt been ""funny"" since the mid 1900s, and even then it wasnt funny- it was racist and only laughed at by white people who couldnt feel its attacks. No one of my generation (90s) or the generation before considered it funny after reaching maturity, and it was not a popular comedic troupe like Shane wants us to believe. It was rare, and the only reason it was so wide spread was because youtube wasnt under the same regulations as broadcasting networks.


The sexualisation of children, and exploitation of  their uncomfortable role in his videos, was also never funny. As teenagers and pre teens some of us laugh, but I guarantee the reason the majority of us laughed is because we were young people (like the people he used in his video) who wanted to be seen as adults- which is what Shane did in his videos. He made us feel like grown ups who were allowed to hear these jokes and participate in them, we were allowed to fawn over a man twice our age because he encouraged it and seemed to appreciate it. I think a lot of us had some form of fucked up crush on Shane, which he clearly knew and pandered to. This was *never* funny. His audience thought it was funny because he was almost grooming us, by telling us we were on his level and involving us in his racism and objectification of women and children."
3620,2020-06-29 13:15:58,hhzi0m,"> it’s been so many years since this happened and he doesn’t make content like this no more.

he only stopped doing blackface bc youtube kept flagging his videos and since then he's surrounded himself with racists and has profited from racism. he still had shanaynay merch up for sale until a few months ago. how hard is it to STOP ENABLING RACISTS? jesus fuck."

Black girls and women are already over-sexualized, and I can’t imagine being willow and knowing someone did that to my image when I was 11 years old."
3636,2020-06-29 14:34:22,hhzi0m,"It’s a parasocial relationship at its worst tbh. We have no idea what Shane or any person online are like. None. Anything they say or post is for a purpose, so their followers see them in a specific light. Makes me uneasy, now more than ever."

However, they are a powerful family who can likely seek some consequences for Shane here, beyond a half assed ‘accountability’ video."
3642,2020-06-29 14:37:27,hhzi0m,"I saw someone (I think ira Madison) on Twitter point out that this is too many things to apologize before and somehow that clicked for me big time. This is a pattern of repeated, harmful, hateful behavior disguised as humor. This is who Shane is and what he’s spent over a decade profiting from. 

If you choose to ignore that or defend it, you are part of the problem."

By allowing Shane to fall on the sword so to speak, people now have to confront that part of themselves. It’s sad and sick, really. 

People say this kind of thing was okay ten years ago and it wasn’t. They’re lying to themselves."

3667,2020-06-29 03:19:05,hhrrx9,"I don’t understand how Christian people can say that god doesn’t like gays, the Bible says that god loves you UNCONDITIONALLY. If he stoped loving you because you are gay that would be a condition to get his love. That being said I don’t consider myself to be religious."
3668,2020-06-29 03:18:59,hhrrx9,Oof
3669,2020-06-29 02:42:17,hhrrx9,Well he sure isn't wrong
3670,2020-06-29 04:20:49,hhrrx9,**THATS A LOTTA DAMAGE**
3671,2020-06-29 22:37:54,hhrrx9,Idk just seems to me that unconditional should not be the term used if in fact it is conditional.
3672,2020-06-29 02:57:36,hhrrx9,Loads lmg for the crusad
3673,2020-06-29 03:53:10,hhrrx9,"Well, then you are a lost soul."
3674,2020-06-29 03:35:14,hhrrx9,"Hey, Christian here. God loves his creation, but he still deems some behaviors/lifestyles unaccapetable. Homosexuality is one of them.
“You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; such a thing is an abomination.” (Leviticus 18:22)"
3675,2020-06-29 02:43:13,hhrrx9,"Fuck religion,  but sometimes it's fun to play along."
3676,2020-06-29 04:02:45,hhrrx9,"That’s a good explanation, but don’t you think some of the ideas in the Bible are a little antiquated? I’m not the most religious person, but I do believe in the message of “love your neighbor”; It seems weird to me that God, as a being of love, would include in the word He left us for all our time on Earth passages that continue to inspire hatred. Forgive my ignorance, but to me, such antithesis to the very nature of God seems a greater blasphemy than the possibility that a few humans, who are known admittedly even among God’s followers to have capacity for sin, took selfish or myopic liberties in the recording of His message."
3677,2020-06-29 04:16:39,hhrrx9,"“Religion has actually convinced people that there's an invisible man living in the sky who watches everything you do, every minute of every day. And the invisible man has a special list of ten things he does not want you to do. And if you do any of these ten things, he has a special place, full of fire and smoke and burning and torture and anguish, where he will send you to live and suffer and burn and choke and scream and cry forever and ever 'til the end of time!

&#x200B;

But He loves you. He loves you, and He needs money! He always needs money! He's all-powerful, all-perfect, all-knowing, and all-wise, somehow just can't handle money!”"
3678,2020-06-29 03:57:06,hhrrx9,Sounds a lot like a condition...
3679,2020-06-29 05:04:40,hhrrx9,"Idk the idea of “unconditional love unless you....” seems hypocritical to me 
And why would he make them gay if he doesn’t approve of it anyways"
3680,2020-06-29 16:22:26,hhrrx9,Looks like somebody woke up this morning with their heterosexuality in tact.
3681,2020-06-29 02:52:28,hhrrx9,Officer we found a gay realease the hounds
3682,2020-06-29 03:33:05,hhrrx9,"Imagine hating people who find a purpose in life greater than themselves, thereby motivating them to pursue moral lifestyles and construct societies and economies with unprecedented levels of food, clean water, comfort, technology, justice, and virtue, humbling those people, thus preventing them from becoming nihilistic and narcissistic monkeys who are slaves to their desires and have no motivation to do anything vaguely useful with their lives."
3683,2020-06-29 04:10:49,hhrrx9,"The message to love your neighbor as you love yourself is absolutely legitimate, and all people should strive to do so. But that doesn’t mean that you should completely turn a blind eye when they do something that God deems, quite literally, “an abomination.”

This by no means is a call to hate them, as that goes against God’s message to love one another. All the Bible says is that what they’re doing is wrong, and that He will judge them for it."
3684,2020-06-29 04:39:20,hhrrx9,"Also, a fun little paradox: 

If God is all powerful and can create anything, could He create an object that even He couldn't lift?

If Yes: It proves that He is not 'all powerful'.

If No: It proves that He cannot create 'anything'."
3685,2020-06-29 04:08:18,hhrrx9,That doesn’t prove anything. The Biblical God is one of justice over emotion. Just because he loves his creation doesn’t mean he lets behavior he deems unholy fly under his radar.
3686,2020-06-29 22:01:46,hhrrx9,"He doesn’t make people who they are. People choose who they are, because he gave us free will. Turns out not everyone is using that wisely."
3687,2020-06-29 22:03:01,hhrrx9,"Ah, it’s always funny to see people who claim that normal behavior is somehow evil and unacceptable. Some things will never change."
3688,2020-06-29 03:17:30,hhrrx9,SOUND THE RAINBOW ALERT
3689,2020-06-29 02:59:18,hhrrx9,Sir I’m here on part of the F.B.I we can take it from here John grab a rag and a water jug Lisa grab the car battery I got the jumper cables
3690,2020-06-29 03:37:22,hhrrx9,"That's a great rant. However, I don't hate the people that follow religion, I hate the idea of it. If you need to follow something imaginary to help you be moral, that's great. Whatever works!"
3691,2020-06-29 04:57:09,hhrrx9,big brain
3692,2020-06-29 04:12:30,hhrrx9,"Just saying it's kinda hypocritical to claim that your love is unconditional, then add a bunch of conditions in the fine print."
3693,2020-06-29 03:48:38,hhrrx9,"Well that’s funny. Because if I recall correctly, you need to believe in a higher being with the authority to assign the morals to the people in order to be moral. Because the laws of the creation are flawed, and the laws of the creator are not.

And don’t try to back out of your statement: your exact words were “Fuck religion,” so you clearly despise the concept *and* those who practice it. I’d like to see an alternate timeline in which religion doesn’t exist, just to see what a complete dumpster fire it would be.

Sure, religions can be flawed, and lead to wars, but I’d take that over humanity being completely uncivilized, with everyone too busy slaughtering and raping each other like animals."
3694,2020-06-29 04:17:17,hhrrx9,"Just because love is unconditional doesn’t mean you let them get away with doing what’s wrong. If you love someone, and they’re harming themselves (because gay sex is quite literally harmful and self-destructive to human anatomy), my bets are that you would discourage that.

The same principle applies. Much like a parent would tell a child not to play in the street, God tells us not to screw people of the same gender. And that’s ignoring the fact that it spits in the face of God’s design, insulting Him."
3695,2020-06-29 04:09:42,hhrrx9,"Fuck religion is right. Treat others like you want to be treated. Dont take no rock science dude to figure that out.

But, if you want to argue, I believe that a person CAN be a good person even if they practice. The idea of religion being necessary to be that good person is bullshit. You're correct that lots of blood has been spilled due to religion. Would blood be spilled if everyone practiced the same religion? Or no religion? If everyone had the same ideology? Religion is something to explain the unexplainable. I firmly believe in science, and if it's not known as fact, its unknown/theory.

The closest thing I believe in as far as religion goes, would be reincarnation."
3696,2020-06-29 04:21:35,hhrrx9,"Sorry, but I refuse to praise someone who demands praise and refuses to admit and ammend their faults. Narcissism is an unhealthy behavioral pattern, ya know?"
3697,2020-06-29 04:26:17,hhrrx9,"At what fault are you accusing God of being? Telling us “no”? Saying that there are rules? Giving us the most miraculous gift of not just existence, but *intelligent* existence, and then asking us to follow some rules so things don’t fall into anarchy? Giving us a set of morals that led to the creation of the most prosperous societies in world history? God should be scorned for that?"
3698,2020-06-29 04:35:00,hhrrx9,"Considering you Lord used to command that people be burned at the stake? Be slaughtered wholesale for defying his word, then condemned to eternal damnation? Kill countless innocents simply because they choose to have an independent opinion.

Yeah, I scorn all that. He sounds like a hypocritical, sociopathic narcissist."
3699,2020-06-29 22:00:54,hhrrx9,"He never glorified slaughter; that’s the fault of the people, not the creator."
3700,2020-06-29 02:34:14,hhrnk3,I don't get inefficient iso ball with Steve Nash. It's weird
3701,2020-06-29 02:47:32,hhrnk3,[removed]
3702,2020-06-29 02:41:02,hhrnk3,"David Robinson doesn't make it in as a big man in the 90s?  

Steve Nash is an inefficient iso scorer?"
3703,2020-06-29 02:33:49,hhrnk3,"wouldn't say Westbrook is era defining lol, imo CP3 was more so."
3704,2020-06-29 02:37:25,hhrnk3,I say that more because he was not playing when I define that era. He was an efficient player in a non efficient era if that makes sense but he defines that time period for me
3705,2020-06-29 02:52:47,hhrnk3,"No he normally was 3-4% above league average ts% and for his usage he had relatively low turnover still 3 a game but guys like tmac, iverson, lebron, harden ect... averaged or do average closer to 4 turnovers a game. People think hes inefficient because his career high fg% is 47% but he always hovered around 45% and he was a 63% finisher at the rim and in his prime a 35-36 3p% shooter, people love that fg% though"
3706,2020-06-29 02:44:40,hhrnk3,No but he wasn't in the 3 point era. I'm saying the era was dominated by a certain kind of player and those are the defining players of that time. It separates nicely into decade but not quite.
3707,2020-06-29 03:22:11,hhrnk3,I see Steve Nash as a foil to that era. He stood out as the efficient player in the inefficient era
3708,2020-06-29 03:15:24,hhrnk3,The guy who averaged a triple double 3 straight years isn't era defining? In the era of inflated stats? Are you high?
3709,2020-06-29 03:37:51,hhrnk3,Well he really only arose once they changed the rules to top iso play from being dominant.  So his rise is part of the trailblazers of the efficiency era.
3710,2020-06-29 03:29:01,hhrnk3,"Oscar was doing that back in the 60s lol, and besides OPs section is titled 3 point revolution which is literally the most defining thing in this era."
3711,2020-06-29 03:32:49,hhrnk3,"Oscar doing that in the 60s and it being a standard expected to stand for the rest of time is precisely the reason why Westbrook is era defining. And your point about 3 point revolution doesn't even make sense. Westbrook benefits from that considering his game revolves around spacing for him to work at its best. What was ""showtime"" about Moses Malone? Showtime means fastbreak offense. Moses was an offense rebounder who played a slow game. Westbrook absolutely deserves his placing."
3712,2020-06-29 03:45:17,hhrnk3,"Dude you realise era defining means they set the standard for an era and changed the way the game is played, Westbrook didn't do that. He didn't revolutionise the game like the others mentioned in that category

Harden

Curry

Lebron

KD

All impacted this era far more than Westbrook ever did"
3713,2020-06-29 03:47:59,hhrnk3,"What did Ewing revolutionize? Moses? Karl Malone? What did they do for their era that Westbrook did not by averaging a triple double? Your arguments make no actual sense. If the barometer is ""revolutionize"" there is maybe one or two guys per generation. You've yet to explain why Westbrook is an odd man out without speaking on anyone else. Is it because you're familiar with him? Has to be lmao"
3714,2020-06-29 03:49:58,hhrnk3,"I'm not saying they did lol, I don't agree with OPs list, was just pointing out Westbrook shouldn't be in the same category as those other 4."

Welcome to Team Fortress 2. After nine years in development, hopefully it will have been worth the wait. To listen to a commentary node, put your crosshair over the floating commentary symbol and press your primary fire. To stop a commentary node, put your crosshair over the rotating node and press your primary fire again. Some commentary nodes may take control of the game in order to show something to you. In these cases, simply press your primary fire again to stop the commentary. In addition, your secondary fire will cycle you through all the commentary nodes in the level. Please let me know what you think after you have had a chance to play. I can be reached at gaben@valvesoftware.com, and my favorite class is the Spy. Thanks, and have fun!

3768,2020-06-29 18:15:01,hhpbvl,Thanks man!
3769,2020-06-28 22:49:40,hho3qg,"You definitely make some valid points.  But I think it's important to note that she is touching on multiple issues at once in her video, and that one issue doesn't negate the other.  Saying the receipts are real doesn't negate the fact that J* is wrongfully sharing this info with people, nor does it negate the racist and other stuff he's done. She probably should've thought this through a bit more, but I don't think her video was expressly in the wrong. But idk, those are just my musings on it."
3770,2020-06-28 23:28:09,hho3qg,"Ok so I’m not the only one confused af. I’m like ok Jeffree is a monster for using the evidence but to me it’s more damning for James so.. I’m like unless this is also a slam against James she totally fucked up because now everyone is looking at James AGAIN. No ones surprised by Jeffree s involvement sadly lol. 

I haven’t seen the video yet and of course all accusations are alleged at this point"
3771,2020-06-28 23:57:37,hho3qg,"I thought the purpose of the video was to both paint Jeffree in a bad light (but obviously no one's surprised lol) and warn people that maybe he was right regardless, I mean you can do both? Also probably indirectly wanted to defend Shane/remind people of who's the monster, especially if James ends up being guilty."
3772,2020-06-29 01:04:26,hho3qg,"There is SO many holes in the story that doesn’t make sense. She first starts off saying j* is manipulative and even Manipulated her to not speaking out with the Dahvie shit but she later found out he lied But then says this memo is very credible even tho is came from the man she just said was manipulative. I wouldn’t be going on the internet with this information but to the police. She posted on Instagram “J* release your receipts to get the heat off my friends (shane) back” so, she was okay with him outing a victim if it got the heat of Shane’s back? If this recording is so disgusting as they say wouldn’t she tell him to release it to the police instead of worrying more about clearing Shane’s name. She was more worried about Shane’s Reputation then the alleged victim of JC. 

Some might say they didn’t release it to the police because the victim didn’t want to but jeffree was showing to many youtubers that the information could have been leaked anyway. If they cared about protecting the victim they wouldn’t have played it to people, went on a podcast talking about it or saying the victim was a YouTuber letting people speculate. 

The whole video made JC look like a monster and J* right for attacking him. I don’t really understand the point of the video."
3773,2020-06-29 00:29:13,hho3qg,She made Jeffree the antagonist if anything 💀 Look at the damn thumbnail and title
3774,2020-06-29 03:36:16,hho3qg,Or perhaps her entire video is a smokescreen to hide the REAL person we should be focused on. Shane. The timing and her confusing ramblings just seem a little to perfect for me. But idk. Who cares. It'll all come out in the wash eventually.
3775,2020-06-28 23:10:50,hho3qg,"Third parties can report a crime. Police can investigate without a victim’s consent. James can’t sue Jeffree for saying something if it’s true. Nobody knows if lawyers actually got involved. 

Jeffree is absolutely at fault for telling everyone about this voice memo and playing it for random people. He even insinuated on Mom’s Basement that it’s not a first-person account, but someone telling a story about james and someone else. Nothing has been verified. Blaire did not get confirmation from a victim. Her video adds nothing to the james part."
3776,2020-06-29 01:04:35,hho3qg,Honestly I’m not a fan of James but he should be making a law suit against everyone and their mother for slander.
3777,2020-06-29 22:05:33,hho3qg,"Just because Jeffree might have a credible source, does not change the terrible, terrible things he’s done and that he’s using this “proof” as a way to manipulate people. Once again, Jeffree has sexually assaulted men, posted revenge porn, and has been buddies with pedophiles, even going so far as to be aware of what Dahvie was doing when they were friends. And what we do know is that whilst the proof might seem credible to Blaire, until this gets taken to court, we don’t know yet if or what it is. We know Jeffree has a history of keeping dirt on people, we know Jeffree is problematic and incredibly money hungry. He does not care who he hurts, so long as he comes out looking like the better man and unfortunately, all of you people keep giving him chance after chance to explain himself when ALLS he does is lie."
3778,2020-06-30 04:44:02,hho3qg,"Idk, I see Blaire as a troll and an instigator. She loves drama in her own way and I'm not surprised she's found her way into this mess especially considering it's blown out of just the beauty community this time. I'm not sure I believe anybody who's that married to controversy. Besides, she shouldn't have asked or accepted to listen to the victim's statements. It's vile that anybody outside of the victim's trusted circle knows about this incident. Also, why a voice recording? What an odd piece of evidence to have. Did Jeffree ask this person to repeat their statements into a microphone or something? What reason did he give for asking to record them? This leads me to believe that he either got the recording without consent, fabricated what was on the recording or is lying about having one all together. Evident from his past, Jeffree loves having information others don't and using it to control other people. I find it awfully convenient he seems to be the only person with such specific and mysterious evidence."
3779,2020-06-28 23:01:47,hho3qg,"I also think there were some valid points in here. However then you got to the part where James involved lawyers and what not to silence Jeffree. Silence him where? Maybe to actually say the words that James actually did something or what? Because J* is STILL showing everyone these “receipts”, and everyone on the outside world is left confused like what’s going on? They made all of this public in the first place and now they have a bunch of people wondering about the facts as well. If J* really was silenced then he wouldn’t be doing all this shit rn. Everyone is being so shady and half ass and nothing is making sense. I believe Blaire is just sick of J* dangling horrible accusations around without no proof or further steps. Also i think she got upset because now Shane got all the heat from his statement and his past and she was like oh get it off him. I honestly think they ALL have their own shit to deal with and it all ended up being mixed into one big mess, and it all seems connected. Everyone (J,S&T) should just stop acting clueless and clear all this shit up. It all just keeps getting bigger and bigger. What is worse? Have the hate keep growing and be cancelled for a loooong time? Or get it off your chest and clear shit up and probably still be canceled, but take accountability and show that you are a changed person and you can be REAL not shady."
3780,2020-06-28 23:52:02,hho3qg,She wants people to be looking at James too in case he actually molested someone
3781,2020-06-29 02:47:57,hho3qg,"Everyone who keeps saying that the people who’ve heard the voice memos should go to the police - what do you think the police would do in this situation exactly? “I heard a voice memo from someone I barely know and don’t trust that is supposedly of someone else I don’t know personally saying that another person I don’t know personally molested them. The victim doesn’t want to press charges though.”

Its extremely hard to get police to take you seriously even if you’re the victim, let alone this."
3782,2020-06-29 17:27:28,hho3qg,Blaire made a series of tearful insta stories about Shane immediately afterwards. I only found out about the Shane thing because of that. So no I don’t think she’s concealing anything.
3783,2020-06-29 02:17:23,hho3qg,"Sexual assault is an EXTREMELY difficult accusation to prove in court, which is why many victims don't want to come forward. It's even more difficult to prove in the court of public opinion. 

James has probably known about this voice recording for ages and even if it's true I am 100% certain James will have prepared an absolute slam dunk of a video rebutting everything the victim says. Public opinion is on James' side right now. People want to see Jeffree and Shane torn down, not James. 

James has a massive upper hand. If it's true, I don't blame the alleged victim for not coming forward. I sure as hell wouldn't."
3784,2020-06-29 02:37:16,hho3qg,Unless it's true.... which may be why this hasn't happened yet
3785,2020-06-29 03:30:19,hho3qg,Seems to me she's just stirring the shit pot while the turds are fresh for them views... I don't trust any of those bottom feeder parasites.
3786,2020-06-29 03:21:26,hho3qg,It is better than sitting around doing nothing or dangling around the internet. If you cared about an alleged victim you would try to do something for them or not speak on it all. They are both using this victims story for their own benefit.
3787,2020-06-29 03:32:20,hho3qg,"If I were the victim and I very specifically did not want my story told nor to go to the police, I would be livid if someone I didn’t even know went to the police for me. I do absolutely agree of course that it shouldn’t be spread around like gossip, and I don’t agree with anyone’s approach to this right now honestly."
3788,2020-06-28 23:43:05,hhng8x,"They are certainly trying to pronounce the German words correctly.  
They get it right quite often.  


The translation is SHIT though. The person responsible for this clearly did not understand the German libretto, but was guessing.  


I like that they made it look like the puppet theatre the opera originates from, though the papageno costume is over the top."
3789,2020-06-29 01:55:30,hhng8x,"When this aired in HD, I left the theater thinking that this was the best Met HD performance I’ve ever seen, and my opinion hasn’t changed a bit. I absolutely love *Zauberflöte*, I’ve seen most versions of it, and there are very few performances that even compare to this one. The cast sounds great, Castronovo’s darker voiced Tamino is very exciting, Schultz and Lewek are both amazing sopranos in their own ways, Werba’s Papageno fits in nicely and Pape brings some much needed experience to a young cast as one of the best ever Sarastros. Levine is a pure Mozartian, and his conduction is perfect. The camera angles are well done and make a great job making this production work on the screen, since it was made to be seen in the house. It will be a sad day when this production is changed. So glad the new production was postponed."
3790,2020-06-28 23:50:35,hhng8x,I confess I don’t know much about opera.  Can someone explain Taymor’s choices re makeup?
3791,2020-06-29 13:52:53,hhng8x,"This production doesn't look nearly as cool in close-up, when you can clearly see all the puppeteers and also how weirdly smooth Papageno's costume is. The exaggerated makeup, which is made to be seen from a distance, also comes across as overkill in the HD I think. I'll have to make an effort to see this production in the house one last time next spring, because it really is an amazing spectacle, and I'll be sad to see it go.

And I'll echo the other commenters here in saying *wow* that is a great cast! And mostly consisting of younger singers the Met doesn't promote much. Hot tip: If you want to hear amazing singing at the Met, go see the B-cast, because they're cast for voice rather than name recognition.

Golda Schultz was the highlight for me. This was her Met debut. I look forward to seeing her in many more roles there."
3792,2020-06-29 02:25:15,hhng8x,The whole thing was amazing except for the three kids. They were so bad.
3793,2020-06-29 03:57:59,hhng8x,"Didn’t get to watch the whole thing, but watched a good bit of it . My first time. Well, it’s definitely Mozart lol! I don’t know who else’s brain some of that stuff could possibly come out of. I love the cool stage affects and makeup. Also  the guy playing Papageno was awesome. And the woman singing the Queen - wow. Made those piercingly high notes sound fluid and beautiful ."
3794,2020-06-29 06:14:04,hhng8x,"Kathryn Lewek is the best Queen, she has the perfect timbre to it and actually has a big voice! A true dramatic coloratura!"
3795,2020-06-28 22:31:39,hhng8x,"This is a great cast (Rene Pape is my operatic everything), but I would like to point out in particular that Charles Castronovo has an absolutely splendid voice and doesn't get utilized the way he should be. That rich baritonal sound is what Jonas Kaufman THINKS he sounds like. Team Charlie."
3796,2020-06-29 01:15:22,hhng8x,"Watching now, this cast has been great so far, very polished musically with strong voices"
3797,2020-06-29 04:50:00,hhng8x,What would you guys recommend to watch: this or [Royal Opera’s version](https://youtu.be/KGUcNzkrAE0) ?
3798,2020-06-29 03:36:35,hhng8x,Thanks! Gonna watch it despite Rene Pape
3799,2020-06-29 17:21:07,hhng8x,Is this one better than the royal opera house's one?
3800,2020-06-29 01:46:42,hhng8x,Met’s subtitles are always terrible.
3801,2020-06-30 02:21:12,hhng8x,"The English translation was created in order to rhyme.  So, of course they wouldn't be able to provide an accurate translation.  Why did they do that?  How dumb."
3802,2020-06-30 02:30:29,hhng8x,"I agree with everything you've said here.  How about the incredible costumes, sets and choreography?  They were fanciful, magical and enchanting without taking anything away from the music. And that trio of angelic little boys? What an amazing job they did. 

All the singing and performing was tremendous. But special mention must go to Lewek for what could be the definitive version of that role, especially with those nine-inch nails (!), Werba, and of course, Pape...such a resonant, beautiful voice.  Bravo ten times ten."
3803,2020-06-29 05:51:47,hhng8x,"Yes, I can.  
The opera's libretto has its roots in a type of mystical puppet theatre that was fashionable in Vienna in those days. Think of all the characters as puppets enacting a slightly dorky drama that is not to be taken too seriously.  
I quite like how they ran with this and made the whole thing look like a puppet show. Espc the three ladies are very well done.  


The whole Isis and Osiris and freemason stuff is pretty baseless, don't read too much into it. Schikaneder, who wrote the libretto didn't really know much about it.  
The most interesting bit is the threefold horn motiv between the overture and the start of the opera proper: it is supposed to mimic the three hammer beats of the master of the freemasons, opening the proceedings. So the threefold call opens the opera.  


(Breathtakingly beautiful music of course. And I find it heartbreaking how rich the guy was in melody; often in this opera, he throws melodic gems away in a two liner and you want to shout STOP, MORE, how does this go on.....Ah well)"
3804,2020-06-29 02:24:23,hhng8x,I don’t understand them myself. The lyrics mention Egyptian gods Osiris and isis but a lot of the costuming is very Asian in feeling. Tamino himself looks like he just stepped out of a Japanese ukiyo e.
3805,2020-06-30 02:33:12,hhng8x,"Really? I adored the little boys. I thought they were perfect.  

It's like I always say:  nine opera lovers, ten opinions.  : -)"
3806,2020-06-28 22:46:19,hhng8x,I love his sound too.  Not sure why he doesn't sing more often at the Met.
3807,2020-06-29 06:01:47,hhng8x," 

ROH, a thousand times.  
The Tamino is not quite as good, but Keenlyside as Papageno is unbeatable. And Dorothee Roeschmann as Tamina is top class. Not to mention Diana Damrau in her life's best performance.

Also, I can not really listen to this here, bc the 'German' they are trying to sing is just horrible. The ROH version has perfect German, Keenlyside is surprisingly accent free.

Oh,,,,,, just checked your link. Well, dang, wrong version. There is another performance with exactly the same staging, but entirely different cast, disappeared from youtube.

At least listen to this:

3808,2020-06-29 06:08:53,hhng8x,Just looked.... still better than the Met
3809,2020-06-29 01:54:15,hhng8x,"Interesting that one particularly bad error is the same in the ROH subs.
Papageno sings that when all the girls would be his, he would buy a lot of sugar (idiom for sweets).
Both subs have something like: exchanged a girl for sugar.

Weird."
3810,2020-06-29 07:22:08,hhng8x,"""Du wirst der Tochter Retter sein."" translated in ""now you can restore love and life"" was quite impressive though"
3811,2020-06-29 05:01:58,hhng8x,yea i don’t get it either. it’s sung beautifully but the staging and costuming is just so weird
3812,2020-06-29 14:11:57,hhng8x,"Well, Tamino's first entrance in the libretto claims he should be in a ""splendid Japanese hunting costume""."
3813,2020-06-28 23:03:27,hhng8x,"His wife is a great soprano too, Ekaterina Siurina. I saw them do Traviata in Toronto a few years ago and it was lovely."
3814,2020-06-29 06:14:22,hhng8x,Thanks! I can’t seem to find the full performance of that ROH version unfortunately. The ‘German’ of the Met performance seems a common criticism lol so will probably watch the ROH one.
3815,2020-06-29 08:52:15,hhng8x,"Where DO they get those ideas, I wonder?"
3816,2020-06-29 16:54:05,hhng8x,I did not realise it was actually specific he was to appear Japanese.
3817,2020-06-29 23:21:18,hhng8x,It does? I never noticed.
3818,2020-06-30 02:24:17,hhng8x,"and that’s what i get for not reading the libretto, eh"
3819,2020-06-29 00:56:37,hhng8x,"Hes awesome! He studied with my undergrad voice teacher, and just has such a refined technique. Inspiring to listen to!"

3821,2020-06-30 12:48:49,hhng8x,"Well, some sources have ""Javanese"", but there is certainly *something* specified"
3822,2020-06-30 12:50:10,hhng8x,"It also claims that Sarastro should appear for the Act I finale in a chariot drawn by six lions, among other fun things no one will ever actually stage."
3823,2020-06-30 12:50:36,hhng8x,I think most people haven't actually read the libretto for this one
3824,2020-06-29 01:16:31,hhng8x,"He actually stepped in and sang Rodolfo when he was *in the audience* one night!

3825,2020-06-29 17:39:55,hhng8x,Thanks so much! I finished watching the other version just an hour ago and enjoyed it. But I will definitely try to see this (while it’s up)!
3826,2020-06-30 13:11:25,hhng8x,"Oh my god, you are right! Just looked it up in my score. I love those tiny phrases that nobody actually follows! Who wouldn't want six lions on a stage."
3827,2020-06-28 21:11:18,hhmfzy,"I don't know, but all I know is that I'm simply revolted by it all. Y'all watch Kitten Lady on Youtube or something, fuck all these youtubers except for Kitten Lady."
3828,2020-06-28 21:13:24,hhmfzy,"Even if it wasn't scripted or made up, there will be hordes of people breaking down how it's a fake (if it is released). With technology today and the money JS has at his disposal... anything is possible. Which is terrifying!"

3844,2020-06-28 23:19:36,hhkbud,"I'd tell him to proceed cautiously. these guys are well-connected and dangerous, and I don't think they take kindly to someone trying to investigate them. that said, they're also quite bold, in that they're having me post all this to the internet, so who knows.

I've very much got the feeling that this is going to come to an end tomorrow (and be perceived that way by you), so it's too late for your friend to do much to help us. I recommend sticking around and seeing what happens next before talking to him. Maybe whoever writes the final summary (hopefully me) will have uncovered something that sheds more light on them."
3845,2020-06-29 00:13:24,hhkbud,"I appreciate your concern! but if that really did happen, i'm confident Mr. Jamison would figure out who did it and only punish that person rather than me."

3849,2020-06-29 00:21:09,hhkbud,He stated very clearly that it will be you who pays the price. He has yet to not follow through on any promises made

3851,2020-06-29 00:24:00,hhkbud,Ah I checked and Alex did write that back on day one. tbh i think Alex misheard Mr. Jamison and transcribed it slightly wrong. Anyway just to be safe i'll follow your advice & make sure no one else uses it.

3854,2020-06-28 18:01:12,hhioim,"Unless there is solid proof, I’m not gonna believe it. The same thing happened last year and look what happened"
3855,2020-06-28 18:01:09,hhioim,I am just guessing but if what Blaire said is true and if Jeffree really has a voice memo proving that JC did infact molest someone then I think its Grayson Dolan. He is the only one I could think of since Jeffree kept bringing Grayson’s name while all of this was going on last year. He said several times that “Grayson was molested by James” but James said in his “No more lies” video that its not true coz Grayson reached out to him and asked if hes okay. But I don’t know!! Ahhhhhh I am so confused and starting to think everything is a lie!!! 😤😤😤The only thing I am sure of is that Jeffree is a piece of shit.
3856,2020-06-28 18:00:23,hhioim,It's wrong to speculate about this stuff but both Petty Paige and Ashley Kyle alluded that it was Grayson Dolan.
3857,2020-06-28 18:11:45,hhioim,"I do believe blaire heard something. However, I’m concerned over how accurate the information she heard was. If there is a victim or actual proof I would 100% believe it but nothing makes sense to me. 

JC video was all about debunking lies and brought up Grayson and how he reached out to him to make sure he was okay. Why say that if it could be easily debunked? Why would the twins be friends with someone going around showing their voice recording story around? Especially if they want to keep it private. Why would jeffree tweet James this year saying he is killing it but has actual proof that he is a sexual predator? Granted, someone told me jeffree doesn’t care about victims just blackmail but none of this makes sense."
3858,2020-06-28 19:15:31,hhioim,"I think she's still being manipulated by Jeffree and diverting attention. Keep it private and support the victim. Why call attention to an allegation you can't provide any proof for under the guise of safety for the victim - yet knowing if there's enough hints people will try to figure it out and then flood the victim asking if they're the one - like people are already doing. I think she's trying to cause a diversion and put heat back on James Charles so Jeffree and Shane can get away with their horrible abusive behavior

Cause the video she talked about - wasn't that the rip off of TehMimi's video and she even edited it to make Jeffree look less bad? If Im mistaken, I apologize but this all looks like a scheme (a ""'Dramageddon' part 2 or 3 or whatever number we're on at this point) to me. Which fyi THESE ARE CRIMES. NOT DRAMA"
3859,2020-06-28 18:07:26,hhioim,Here is Blair’s White’s video for those who haven’t seen it yet. [Blaire White’s Video](https://youtu.be/P9wlKco2YYI)
3860,2020-06-28 18:07:42,hhioim,Just did!
3861,2020-06-28 18:06:05,hhioim,"Yeah, I can agree with that stance. It’s hard telling what’s true and what’s not."
3862,2020-06-28 18:07:07,hhioim,[deleted]
3863,2020-06-28 18:05:16,hhioim,Agreed. This whole thing is so much to follow and really sad if it’s true or not.
3864,2020-06-28 18:03:05,hhioim,"You’re right. I didn’t mean to be insensitive or come across as an asshole in regards to the victims. I’m sorry if that is how I came across!

I vaguely remember a screenshot of texts being released from Jeffree last year talking about one of the Dolan twins coming out with a statement."
3865,2020-06-28 18:12:57,hhioim,I agree. This whole thing is twisted and confusing.
3866,2020-06-28 19:26:36,hhioim,I also wondered if Jeffree manipulated her into sharing this and doing the dirty work for him so he could wipe his hands clean if whatever receipts he’s claiming to have. I don’t know. There’s a LOT of speculation and a lot of people are suspicious of this whole situation.
3867,2020-06-28 18:10:40,hhioim,"Tdlr of blaire’s video:

She starts of by saying that she was scared to release the video, but decided to go ahead as it was “the right thing to do” Claims to have been told things by J that made her feel complicit to his actions

Verifies that she has never met J, but facetimed him twice

She explains that when she was making a video on Dahvie Vanity, J called her and manipulated her into not releasing the vid. She agreed to not release it.

When she saw J on the Chris Hansen podcast “clearing” his name, she realized he lied and dropped the video

On the facetime when J was manipulative, she claims that J told her that James Charles raped a well known youtuber and he provided a voice memo proving it. Blaire feels that it is not her place to release the memo, but urges the victim to speak up.

She claims J told her that another well known youtuber raped someone, but while J provided no evidence, she believes it is “believable”

She finishes by saying she doesn’t condone shanes jokes, amd that she just discovered everything like the rest of us.

To conclude, she provided no receipts, but i think not releasing the voice memo is understandable if its true

She says that keemstar probs has heard the voice memo as J is alleged to have played it to him before an interview

Edit: words"
3868,2020-06-28 18:10:28,hhioim,"Yeah, i dont blame blaire for not releasing-the alleged voice memo, but if shes just starting shit then she can fuck off"
3869,2020-06-28 18:12:05,hhioim,Thank you for providing this!
3870,2020-06-28 17:35:07,hhihiw,I don't want to give her views. Anyone have a TLDR or a link to a mirror?
3871,2020-06-28 17:39:13,hhihiw,"The TL;DR - Blaire was going to make a video on Jeffree's connection to Dahvie. Jeffree was in her DMs immediately after she tweeted responsed this to someone (she didn't @ Jeffree but he was in her DMs immediately for damage control)

Then Jeffree offered to FaceTime Blaire and they had a long discussion about Dahvie. Then he suddenly changed the topic to James Charles and referenced Blaire's comments last year (about how Jeffree should have never said stuff about James being a sexual predator without providing receipts).

Jeffree offered to show Blaire proof of the sexual assault thing. The proof that Jeffree showed Blaire was a voicememo of a popular YouTuber telling J* about James sexually assaulting them. Blaire saw proof that it was genuine and believes it is. That YouTuber doesn't feel comfortable coming out about it publicly. 

J* said that's why James hasn't come for him in any responses or anything because of this dirt. J* then said he has dirt on EVERYONE. It kind of come off as a threat? Sorta. He also apparently has receipts of other YouTubers who have raped people and is keeping it as blackmail, apparently.

That makes my previous theory correct. That J* only went public about James assaulting someone because he thought the victim would come forward and back him up. But the victim decided not to / didn't feel comfortable doing it (which they have the right to do it is their story), and thus J* had no credibility."
3872,2020-06-28 16:53:57,hhhgya,"I think things will get worse and Shane will eventually just quit youtube, honestly. The dude has a decade of YouTube behind him filled to the brim with racist, pedophilic, harmful jokes. A different clip of him being racist could go viral everyday and that’s going to be in his “permanent record” forever. There’s a new clip right now going around. His apology has become null and void. I truly think its over for him in terms of any career going forward."
3873,2020-06-28 16:39:00,hhhgya,"A part of me feels bad because I truly love his videos (from recent years) but then looking at all this just sickens me I just wish he was different. It won’t be like James Charles because those were just rumors and he debunked them, Shane can’t debunk hard evidence of what he did and that’s why I don’t think he could come back from this. I’m just upset because I love rylands content and idk what he’s gonna do."
3874,2020-06-28 17:03:43,hhhgya,"it's over bc mainstream media is starting to get on his ass, not to mention actual celebrities (ie. the smiths) are speaking up. the thing with willow could lead to real legal action and i don't think youtube will hold on to sh*ne for much longer."
3875,2020-06-28 17:44:59,hhhgya,"I could see him quitting YouTube and trying to make movies under his real name, Shane Lee Yaw, but even then I don’t see him being that successful with that."
3876,2020-06-28 16:47:14,hhhgya,"things are still going to get way worse. all the clips resurfacing of him are being sent to the police, by multiple people. if his career doesn’t go to shit on its own, it will when he goes to jail for sexual exploitation of children."
3877,2020-06-28 23:55:39,hhhgya,"if he wants to continue making youtube videos I think that he could still do it and gets lots of views and ad revenue with no sponsors

but the hate and criticism wont go way for a long time"
3878,2020-06-29 00:52:10,hhhgya,I don’t think he’s gonna be able to keep going. At all.
3879,2020-06-29 05:48:08,hhhgya,"I only became a fan since the conspiracy videos and I’ve never seen anything that made me really concerned, but seeing all these old clips is crazy. I think if he quits Youtube he won’t have much else he can do. He’s not really qualified for anything and his desire to write/produce movies could be impacted by all these scandals so... 🤷🏻‍♀️"
3880,2020-06-28 17:07:06,hhhgya,"I agree. I think that he's going to just quit YouTube. He's already pretty much a recluse and only posts sporadically at this point. I think he's going to go dark and live off his collab money for quite some time. Beyond that, I don't know what else I expect to happen."
3881,2020-06-28 17:28:24,hhhgya,"Agreed. And tbh I don’t really think he’d be too upset about leaving. Maybe he’d be upset about having such a sour exit, but he has always said “I’m not going to be doing this in my 30s,” “I won’t be doing this forever.” I know he wants to make movie but I think he’ll come to the conclusion that he doesn’t need YT for that and it wasn’t the right avenue for movies anyway and try a different, less public route."
3882,2020-06-28 18:12:47,hhhgya,"It seemed like it couldn't get any worse, but every day since this has happened there's ANOTHER clip of him being a racist or something more than inappropriate involving children."
3883,2020-06-28 17:39:36,hhhgya,Did Will Smith come out and say anything or is staying silent since Orlando brown came out and said he raped him when he was a little kid?
3884,2020-06-28 20:12:46,hhhgya,"yeah, given his first movie was reeeeally bad. to the point where a producer pulled their name off it because they were so embarrassed over it."
3885,2020-06-28 17:36:33,hhhgya,He already made a movie called Not Cool.
3886,2020-06-28 20:30:12,hhhgya,"Yeahhh, I never realized how deep this “dark, edgy” humor went for him. It’s honestly scary."
3887,2020-06-28 17:46:53,hhhgya,did you do any research into that? He posted an incoherent video accusing multiple people of raping him and his entire family. I think he even said he could be either Will Smith or Michael Jackson’s kid. There’s 0 credibility
3888,2020-06-28 17:42:15,hhhgya,Yeah but recently he said he wants to write a horror movie.
3889,2020-06-28 17:48:14,hhhgya,Going beyond Orlando brown posting the video will smith name is in epsiteins black book
3890,2020-06-28 15:37:26,hhg8oq,Yeah idk! That ass needs to get dragged too. Tati too.
3891,2020-06-28 15:57:52,hhg8oq,"J\* has always been problematic, angry, loud and manipulative etc. He never really pretended to be anything else (cough an sensitive empath), so basically, as awful as it is, no one is exactly surprised, I guess? Like yeah, he's disgusting and pos, everyone knows it, he knows it, he doesn't hide it and that's that. The only time he attempted to redeem himself was Shane's series, but I didn't buy it then and he clearly hasn't changed. 

People who dislike him (like me) likely never really supported him in the first place. Those who did and still do, are either dealing with internalized shit and brush his problematic moments off or they are just like him, racist or otherwise gross. So they don't care, why tf would they cancel someone who they agree with and who they share opinions with ykwim.

He has money, he has blackmail and he has that power. Obvs someone like me can't begin to cancel him bc he has supporters willing to buy his shit. Just like Trump has supporters willing to vote for him. I have cancelled J\* for myself a loooong time ago and have never supported him in any way (never subbed, never bought his shit, never watched his content etc)."
3892,2020-06-28 16:48:28,hhg8oq,"Jeffree is on another level of rich that even if his entire YouTube career is cancelled, he'll still be able to sell makeup and earn a fortune. He's a different breed, practically an ascended being in the realm of the beauty community. No matter what controversy happens, he comes out a couple of months later as though it never happened. It's honestly scary. 

What's amazingly ironic and amusing to me is that his old friends are doing better than ever right now, especially James Charles, while he and Shane continue to be in the hot seat. And honestly, if Shane's career ends because of this ( and I'd be surprised if it isn't, considering the entire Smith family is involved now ), I sincerely doubt Jeffree will suffer. He'll be just fine. And that's a huge problem."
3893,2020-06-28 18:32:43,hhg8oq,"I reiterate, JEFFREE HAS NOTHING ZERO ZILCH NADA TO DO WITH THIS CURRENT SITUATION. So why drag HIM over this?? Yeah the tati and all that stuff, sure. He was front and center. The pedo situation is 100% all shane. If he drops shane like a hot potato, who could really blame him? Regardless of all of jeffrees mistakes and trashy behavior, he DID build his business from the ground up and has a very successful company that extends beyond youtube. It would be career suicide to NOT drop him from his brand. Nothing jeffree has ever done holds a candle to pedophilia. Hard evidence of it. It seems like some are blaming shanes downfall on him being friends with jeffree which is fucking ridiculous at this point. Yes jeffree is a shady drama queen narcissist that doesn't care to step on the necks of those who gets in his way BUT he doesn't glorify baby fucking!! Hate jeffree, hate shane but keep them in separate lanes. Nobody knows what jeffree will do about this situation with shane. In my opinion he absolutely should cut ties. Even if you despise jeffree, you know its true too. This isn't something that you can just look over. This is deep and criminal and extremely serious. If shane ends up utterly alone, he only has himself to blame. You can not keep looking at him like good ole shane the funny loveable greasy teddy bear with a bundle of nerves that just wants everyone to like him. He is a predator. We should see him as a predator. He should be treated as a predator. I think we can safely stop comparing shane and jeffree together. Jeffree preys on the weaker of the beauty guru sheep to become more powerful. Asshole moves and deplorable behavior? Yes. Criminal and life shattering behavior? No. 
Shane preys on sexualizing children time and time and time again for ""jokes"". Who knows how much more will come out. So how in the hell can some of you still put them in the same category??"
3894,2020-06-28 15:44:35,hhg8oq,"I do feel like Tati was manipulated by Jeffree too. That doesn't excuse her behavior, but once again, someone who never had drama with anyone, she starts hanging out with J* & then all of this happens.

I know Tati has a lot going on IRL (infertility, endometriosis, illnesses in her family, etc.) & I feel like Jeffree was in her ear, being like, ""Are you just gonna keep letting James get away with treating you this way on your own birthday?"" ""Wow, what a bad friend that he collabed with your competition."" Again, not that any of that excuses her behavior, I just think that man loves to make mountains out of molehills & then just sit back in his Versace robe, hiding out in his million dollar mansion with all his pomeranians, just watching the drama unfold.

It also kinda makes you wonder if Nathan had some kind of idea of what was going on & that's why he dipped tf out. 

Is this man a hypnotist? How the hell does he do all of this?"
3895,2020-06-28 16:01:06,hhg8oq,"I always hope for change & growth. When he spoke about having so much anger back in the Myspace days because he was the first androgynous person in that scene & did face a lot of shit for it, I felt bad for him. I wanted to believe that he had let go of that anger was trying to be a better person. But obviously he's still the same trash he's always been."

3897,2020-06-28 16:07:42,hhg8oq,"He has anger issues and it's fairly obvious imo. Whenever he was involved in drama he would run to snapchat or whatever to post videos of himself where he acts like a crazy person, loud, fake laughter and screaming, making huge eyes etc when you can just tell he's enraged. Yet, what he says is all like, ""omfg I don't even care LOL at YOU blah blah"" yeah, sure jan.

ngl some people never change, bc they don't even want to and I think J\* is one of them. I never felt bad for him and I don't think I ever will."
3898,2020-06-28 23:27:07,hhg8oq,"I have read his history. The only one  i saw was the remark about justin beiber when he was 16. And as you said yourself, he ""sexually harassed men"" MEN being the key word here. Im not saying that he is an upstanding member of society. However 99% of the ppl he has victimized have been adults. Doesn't make it right but still not as bad as shane. I realize that im just beating my head against a wall. Jeffree will always be the worse of worst no matter what to some ppl. I just don't understand how ppl are saying that its jeffrees fault? His hands are clean in this particular situation. Im taking about this one right now involving all the pedo shit that's coming up and the willow situation. Shane has a long history of talking about and ""joking"" about and doing nasty shit in videos about molestation. None of ""that"" involves jeffree. That's all im trying to point out. So in my opinion, when discussing this particular subject and scandal, jeffree doesn't need to be brought up. Correct?? We should focus all of our attention on shane and only Shane. He should not be allowed the privilege of any negative attention escaping HIS actions by ppl constantly bringing up jeffrees past when discussing the pedophilia subject. I've ALWAYS said that Shane is probably a master manipulator. I didn't buy his acts for a second! He is always playing a part and putting on a show. I thoroughly believe he used lisa. At first it was to ""try to act straight"" (his words not mine). Then the dramatic crocodile tears breakup video. Stuff started coming out about how he emotionally drained and abused lisa. Then the coming out video which basically was a scapegoat for y he treated lisa that way. He was confused blah blah blah. Even tho he has said many times since that he has always known he was bisexual and preferred men. There are several examples. Yall know the tea. No one will EVER convince me that he didn't 100%  premeditate the plot to knowingly and purposely destroy bobby burns. He planned it and executed it because of the videos that bobby made about him. He knows his fans and he knew beyond a shadow of a doubt how they were going to react to bobby and him being on shanes channel. He knew exactly what was going to happen. To the fans shanes a great guy by forgiving his hater and bringing him to LA and jumpstart his career! Bullshit!! He knew exactly what he was doing. Not one fuck given about this poor guy. He used his fans and his platform to literally ruin a kids life whose only mistake was having the nerve to talk bad about the high and mighty shane fucking dawson and being gullible enough to believe that shane was genuinely trying to help him. He surrounds himself with problematic ppl for a reason. He's not trying to help them. He keeps them around bc he knows they will keep fucking up and he can continue to be their ""rock"" little do they know, they are only there bc they are fuck ups and ppl love to hate them. He can use them as a smokescreen when he fucks up. When he shows his true colors and his ass is on the radar, ppl will always always always be like "" well you know he was trying to help  tana or trish or (insert your favorite fuck up here) and things got taken out of context"" or ""everyone is hating on him bc he took up for (pick a skank) and that's why he said it"". People will always compare him to their most hated ""friend"" when discussing shanes fuck ups. They diminish the severity of shanes actions bc USUALLY he is the lesser of 2 evils therefore the blame shifts from shane to any of his band of merry mess of mental madness and all around white trash cluster fuck of dumpster fire divas that we all love to hate!! Jeffree star is no different. Actually he is Shane's golden goose for this tactic if you think about it. Every fucked up thing that Shane has said and done since first going public with their white swan black swan friendship, has been blamed on jeffree in way or another. Per usual we had shanes taking up for my problematic friend video and tweets. He played completely ignorant on the tati james shit. He was balls deep in that entire thing i guarantee it. He plots and very strategically makes moves while playing the naive poor little former fat boy. I personally think jeffree got played. He was easy to fool bc of his huge ego. Shane oooo and awwwed at shit like his ass is broke. He stroked jeffrees ego and became his lap dog. Yet ppl still think jeffree is taking advantage of shane. No. Shane will leave this relationship a whole lot richer with a whole lot more connections and as a perk, has yet another person ppl can blame for shanes mistakes. Jeffree will walk away with a shit ton of cleanup to do. If he jerks shanes name from his brand, he will lose time and money that was allocated for other things. Im sure there are legal actions that need to be taken. Plus he will have to listen to what a shitty friend he is for dumping shane. Even tho everyone else has or will. Soooooo this is why it pisses me off to see j* being dragged into this particular pedophilia mess. This time, he doesn't deserve it."
3899,2020-06-28 16:15:58,hhg8oq,"I relate to what Shane said about trying to fix people. It's taken me 30 years on this earth to realize that I cannot fix anyone, they've gotta fix themselves. 

I think Shane has always wanted to fit in so bad & that's why he's done all the weird problematic shit that he did. He wanted people to think he was funny, shocking, & crazy. But it just didn't land with most people. I don't think he's actually a racist or a pedophile or anything like that, honestly. I just think he's tone deaf & really doesn't read the room. And obviously he's not great at taking any sort of criticism. People told him his shock humor wasn't landing. Back then, yeah, we all had weird, fucked up senses of humor. I'm about the same age as him, so I can speak on our love of dark humor. But he goes past the edgy humor into problematic. 

 And then he tried to recreate himself with the Bunny series (which I actually really liked), the Tana series, both Jeffree series, & of course the Jake Paul series. But instead of helping any of these people, he just tiptoed around the major subjects & just let them use his series as a platform for their garbage narratives.

The Eugenia series really got to me though. I think it's good to bring light to eating disorders, but it just seemed more exploitative. I think Brittany should have gotten her own series, or at least her own video. I read her book & DAMN, WHAT A WILD, SCARY RIDE."

3901,2020-06-28 16:33:37,hhg8oq,"I don't think ""it was that time"" can be used as some excuse or is even accurate. Not everyone was making these jokes or being problematic. Maybe many or some did, but not everyone. Shane actively helped to influence that time, as well. He had a platform. It still didn't make it acceptable. What this does is it removes some of the blame from the individual. He was an adult, he had access to the internet, he could've educated himself instead of doing blackface. 

As for the pedo jokes, there is no way he didn't know how fucked up it was and I don't see any other youtubers who did that? so it was not something everyone did. It was something Shane did.

Likewise with wanting to fit in. I can understand when people smoke, or drink or do drugs and say they wanted to fit in. I don't understand making crazy shocking jokes bc he ""wanted to fit in"" fit in with who, exactly? The racists? The pedophiles? I mean what.

I don't think that I can say, with certainty, that he is NOT in fact a racist or a pedophile. I just can't. The fact is, he said way too many things, stretched over years, for it not to be very alarming and damning. So he very well may be. 

I question the whole ""he wanted to help these people"" bc he didn't choose random people, he chose very controversial and/or very popular people who have a big audience. Because he wanted views. If he actually wanted to help people he would volunteer at shelters or something, make a docu series on the realities of being homeless in the US or other big issues, god knows there's plenty. 

As for Eugenia, sure bringing light to eating disorders is good but 1. She was still struggling and nowhere near past recovery and 2. SHE should've been the one to do it, on her channel, on her terms, years after she recovered and when she was truly ready to speak on the matter at length and honestly. This time, she clearly wasn't. But he still exploited her.

Agree about Brittany. The way he did her segment was just tasteless and tone deaf.

/essay lol"
3902,2020-06-29 00:05:53,hhg8oq,I do apologize for the formatting. I'm on mobile. I typed so much that my hand was hurting lol. I get what you're saying. Jeffree has to deal with his past. I only want Shane to face the music himself without other ppls past being drudged up at the same time. Know what i mean? I guess i went the long way about it lol
3903,2020-06-28 16:36:02,hhg8oq,"The Brittany thing REALLY got to me, because the trauma that woman went through cannot be expressed in an hour segment in between Chuck E Cheese & iPhone conspiracies. Her story was not a conspiracy. It was her story & it really should have been told in a different manner."
3904,2020-06-28 16:42:16,hhg8oq,"Yes, definitely and it took guts for her to STILL go out, make a book, be on video and talk about this when she is still terrified of that man. ngl not many people would be able to do what she did (and that's understandable, not a dig at them), but it's just hard, especially when a cis white man is involved.

But there he just shoved her story in with Chuck E Cheese and lbr, it was bc Brittany wasn't a well know ytber or super popular. That's why I don't buy his whole ""I just wanna help!"" shtick. Nah, he just wants to make money and get views and validation."

It also pisses me off that he’s nominated himself as gatekeeper for the beauty industry. You’re a 21 year old white man, you have no business telling a female dominated industry what is acceptable."
3908,2020-08-20 16:21:07,idblqb,"I’m all about the beauty space being open to everyone, but it leaves a bad taste in my mouth to see men gatekeeping women who are entering the beauty industry. Esp when massive cosmetics companies are owned by rich, white men. This is a BAD look for James."
3909,2020-08-20 14:50:04,idblqb,I really don’t like him 😅
3910,2020-08-20 18:50:06,idblqb,"I agree, he seems to be taking every launch way too personally. I've defended James before but specifically when women release makeup or advance in the beauty space (for example, marlena being featured on a netflix doc) he is soooo entitled. he's thrown several full-on tantrums over this, most recently with Alicia Keys and Lauren Conrad. I've defended James before but it's not lost on me that he only attacks women in the beauty sphere.

i know someone in BGC found a trademark filed for james for perfume weeks ago. maybe something is in the works there. I surely think James' approach is going to backfire. He was temporarily vindicated because of the bye sister aftermath, but now with each shitty thing he does and subsequent half-assed apology every week, the GP is starting to remember how obnoxious and horribly entitled he is on his own merit."
3911,2020-08-20 17:11:21,idblqb,Yes!! I was suspecting the same thing. I bet he has at least one drama-related shade name in his palette. My money’s on “hair vitamins”
3912,2020-08-20 14:58:19,idblqb,If this is true it is going to back fire on him.
3913,2020-08-21 00:41:26,idblqb,I wish people would stop paying attention to him so he'd just go away.
3914,2020-08-20 21:39:45,idblqb,"p sure he only apologised bc people thought he was attacking Addison Rae, who he is friends with"
3915,2020-08-20 23:44:30,idblqb,I was wondering if maybe he’s already tried to start one but something fell through and now he’s jealous of the people actually pulling it off
3916,2020-08-30 21:22:27,idblqb,I suspect he is coming out with a lipliner/lipstick...
3917,2020-08-25 19:40:47,idblqb,Jeez the beauty industry is so much bigger than YouTube makeup gurus. Some of these you tubers seem to be so entitled it’s baffling.
3918,2020-08-26 06:03:17,idblqb,I see what shane was talking about (humble pie)
3919,2020-08-30 20:16:07,idblqb,I've been having a sneaking suspicion he is coming out with one soon too or is currently in the development process of creating his own makeup brand as well.
3920,2020-08-20 15:01:01,idblqb,[deleted]
3921,2020-08-20 17:12:12,idblqb,"I think it's more that the makeup industry is INSANELY over-saturated right now, and thanks to the pandemic it's also struggling. Even if he's not starting his own makeup line, I bet a lot of established makeup companies he might have wanted to do collabs with are starting to get nervous. There's been a lot of **really** good deals lately which is a sign they're trying to get liquid cash quickly. Like 2008 housing crisis but for makeup

He's *definitely* in it for the money, which is why we're seeing this outbursts. Cause there's strong warning signs the money train for whatever he invested his time and possibly money in is gonna dry up.

Im wondering if maybe he was midway through planning/executing a line and it got put on indefinite hold? I could also definitely see OP's theory too"
3922,2020-08-20 17:16:16,idblqb,Right? Especially LC?? I’m only a couple years older than JC but I know she’s like the original influencer. Gotta respect those who came before you!
3923,2020-08-20 15:04:43,idblqb,"I mean he says ""I just opened a PR package from a 'new makeup brand' from somebody who has no business having a makeup brand"" and ""Stop... stop making makeup brands... stop ... STOP!"". Regardless of if calling out the brand's packaging was warranted or not, it's clear he's still heavily gatekeeping."
3924,2020-08-20 16:30:56,idblqb,LC responded and said it was an accident. She was using empty products to make sure they all fit in the package and accidently sent out a few atill like that. She apologized and said she would fix it. That doesn't give him the right to fly off the handle like that.

3927,2020-08-20 15:19:11,idblqb,Probably because you called JC a ‘winy [sic] manbaby’ and then declared that you’d never buy from the brand ever again because they made a mistake with 1 PR package before they even properly established themself.

To a certain point, his rant about empty packaging has some validity, what rubbed me the wrong way was him saying someone who has no business being in the industry. It’s akin to those people who say “I’ve been in the makeup world for YEARS and have NEVER heard of x.” Like just because YOU personally don’t know much about the person doesn’t discredit them. I hope that makes sense."
3940,2020-08-20 12:50:04,id7net,Srs how come everyone is obsessed with LC though? Did I miss the part where she’s the uncontested beauty icon of the century? There wasn’t this much excitement when Lady Gaga announced her brand.
3941,2020-08-20 15:01:41,id7net,"I mean I think his reaction was over the top personally but he’s an influencer so whatever, no one watches a boring influencer. I do feel it was a one time mistake based on her side.

But I don’t know where everyone is getting off acting like LC is like, a style or fashion god. I grew up in Laguna Beach peak and all, have seen it and had friends who watched it. No one really cared about her that much back then, and no one has checked for her in at least 5 years lmao. I mean it’s her right to make a brand, but where is all this worship coming from, no one has mentioned her in ages anywhere lol

And people saying she paved the way is just hilarious. For what, sorority girl style?"
3942,2020-08-20 14:57:27,id7net,"I agree that he had every right to put the brand on blast for empty packaging bc like come on how do you mess up that bad? Especially on PR which is an important part of advertising. What I took issue about is how he acts as if Lauren is some random he's never heard of so she must be irrelevant. It reminded me of the Marlena as ""that woman"" situation. I may be reading too into it but I thought it was kind of rude."
3943,2020-08-20 14:08:09,id7net,"The moderators over there are weird as crap.

This is the second time James’s video was uploaded. First time with a fairly neutral title. Second time the title is drag him.

They have such a weird hate boner for him. The actions of the 22 mega threads last year celebrating the downfall of a 19 year old...to shifted perspective this year.

But he is right in the sense that literally anyone and everyone is slapping their names on products. I’m 32. I watched the hills years ago. I wouldn’t say Lauren is my style icon or inspired me. I also haven’t thought of her in more than 6 years. But because the sub is soooo nostalgic over LC, she can do no wrong 😩. The lengths they go to justify their clownery or who they support is unreal."
3944,2020-08-20 10:49:50,id7net,I'm so happy we have a new totally valid  reason to hate on him after he got un-cancelled 😍😍😍😍
3945,2020-08-20 10:47:27,id7net,Why is everyone in that thread ignoring the fact he got sent empty packaging? It makes the brand look like a cheap cash grab which is what everyone was saying before anyway. If this was Jaclyn's brand the thread would be foaming at the mouth to insult her
3946,2020-08-20 17:41:18,id7net,"My favorite part was when a commenter mentioned a very good point of how this could all be part of a PR stunt to boost LC's line, and someone else melted so hard saying that that's not LC's way!!!111!!!

It's really too much.  I screencapped it in all it's glory for your viewing pleasure:

Who would have thought there were so many LC stans on BGC?

srs I am in no way condoning James' behavior, he was definitely very immature about about it, but the amount of stans that came out of the woodwork in support of LC, a reality star who hasn't been relevant since 2010 was just laughable."
3947,2020-08-20 16:27:25,id7net,Dude. LC's brand sending EMPTY containers in PR is actually.... really glaringly bad. If I was having a weird day and opened my PR to see that I'd feel like I was going crazy too. James is human with human emotions. Shocking.
3948,2020-08-20 11:46:49,id7net,"if that were empty packages from Jefree Star Cosmetics, Patrick Star “One size”,  Manny Mua brand or Nikita Dragun, the main subreddit would applaud James for being truthful and bringing other creators down. 

It’s only bad if James criticizes basic white woman with plastic, low-effort makeup. Everyone saying this is just a mistake, but it is THE biggest mistake on the one of most important marketing steps. If the brand can’t even look after quality of their boxes for influencers, what about down to earth consumers without power or following?"

3952,2020-08-20 11:22:03,id7net,"Making an angry uninformed video as an influencer is different than a consumer complaining about an over saturated market and poor products. You can’t be surprised that people would call him out. Of course LC should have double checked before sending it out, but people make mistakes and she addressed it. I think the issue is people are tired of the cycle of JC making mistakes and apologizing and making the same mistakes. I don’t think this is a cancellable offense. But it’s worth talking about and worth questioning why anyone thinks they have authority over who has business making a beauty brand."
3953,2020-08-20 18:05:19,id7net,"i hate to say it guys but i'm with the bgcers on this one, he's being an asshole. my issue definitely isn't the fact he's complaining about celebrity brands, i think the constant launches are jarring as fuck and majority transparent cashgrabs lmao – it's *how* he's complaining.

i think bgc has treated james disgustingly, and their treatment of jackie's brand vs laurens is so transparent and gross. i think anyone has a right to give negative reviews and *should* if it's warranted. his attitude here was gross and his attitude the past few things he's had to apologise for has been gross, point blank. he's being a brat"

And OMG Lauren Conrad, whom no one has thought about in the last 10 years, is MY FUCKING QUEEN and how DARE you shit on her for sending you empty things because her makeup line is *so amazing*  even though it's super similar to makeup launches that *we* have shit on."
3955,2020-08-20 15:41:46,id7net,"I honestly don’t understand why BCG is hating on James. The whole point of a PR package is so influencers can give a review, whether positive or negative. Like yeah, mistakes happen, but the influencer has every right to give a negative review. If LC puts in such low effort in a PR box sent to influencers, then the actual products that will be sold to the public must be much worse! So James is actually doing a public service by warning of shitty products. Why doesn’t BCG get this??"

I'm 24 and I don't know who the fuck LC is.Apparently she was a reality show star in 2004,when JC was just 5 years old!5 YEARS OLD!Ofc he doesn't know her,and a large portion of the beauty community doesn't know her as well(idk if they noticed but people who were born in 2000 are currently twenty years old).I don't care how popular her clothes were 10 years ago, she's pretty much irrelevant in the beauty sphere in 2020,no matter how hard they try to make her happen.Idk why they like to pretend that a person who hasn't been involved in the mainstream media for 5 years and suddenly tries to enter one of the most successful industries of 2020 is anything but a cash grab!Like it or not,JC is currently dominating the internet beauty community,so he has every right to rant about people who obviously don't give a fuck about makeup unless it's clear that it benefits their bank account, especially when their debut itself looks like a trainwreck.I'm wondering if they would be so mad if this was a Jaclyn cosmetics PR package.

Lastly, ranting about mansplaing and gLasS eScAlaToR every time a male member of the beauty community throws a little bit of shade towards your favourites doesn't give you woke points.Nobody is convinced, especially those who witnessed the MASSIVE hate boner y'all had towards Jackie's ""tacky cash grab candles"".At the end of the day, it's a millionaire against another millionaire.I'm sure LC will be ok without your heartfelt defence."
3957,2020-08-20 10:29:52,id7net,"And how dare James ( who is a man) have an opinion!! It’s misogyny that he doesn’t agree with them and only women are allowed to dominate the industry

But we can say the exact same comment and 🙊"
3958,2020-08-21 00:46:58,id7net,"On the other hand, everyone knows she's launching a brand now. Calculated move maybe? 😂"
3959,2020-08-20 18:52:34,id7net,"I want the Lauren Conrad Beauty lip and cheek tint, I do like her aesthetic. God I’m dumb and gullible. Talk me outta it!!! Please. I already have a Bobbi brown pot similar to this. It’s the vibe I’m falling for I think, I do like the packaging. I’m not a huge recycler type either so I’m not sure why I’m acting like a crack head right now. Sucker for marketing."
3960,2020-08-21 03:21:03,id7net,"srs. I do think that the mistake on the company's part wasn't great. They should have double-checked the PR that was being sent out, and he has every right to be annoyed by that.

My problem is the \*way\*he handled that. Yes, it wasn't cool that he got the PR that way - and I 100% agree he's within his rights to say something - but the way he went off? Esp. about her being ""someone who has no business"" running a makeup company? That leaves a bad taste in my mouth given that LC has been associated with the beauty industry for years. It feels very gatekeeper-y and, honestly, yeah. It does strike me as possibly being misogynistic since this is the 3rd time he's lashed out at an older, generally well-established/well-known woman like this.  Maybe it isn't misogynistic, but the fact he's only gone off on women...idk. It feels off to me.

Either way, he handled it badly and while BGC def. has one to far in parts, I more or less agree that this wasn't it chief."
3961,2020-08-20 20:04:17,id7net,What did he do this time
3962,2020-08-21 20:07:49,id7net,Please see my latest comment there get downvoted by all the wine moms on bgc who burn millions of calories hating on JC. Like block him?
3963,2020-08-20 19:55:14,id7net,"Yeah, I mentioned this on that thread. That (conspiracy!) Lauren might be covering up for somebody's mistake and saying it was her fault in the way that she did makes it cute. Otherwise, it shows how sloppy and sus the company is. Her response was clever and didn't put anyone down, while James could have just mentioned the empty containers without dragging the brand. People would have focused more on the fact that the company made a mistake rather than James once again being entitled.

I also find it funny that people will now be supporting Lauren's brand out of spite for James lol. Like how people bought Tati's pills. He's like a reverse influencer. People sometimes just have an irrational hate for him."
3964,2020-08-20 16:37:54,id7net,"Yeah it makes sense. While it was unprofessional to send empty packages, the way he handled it was seriously disrespectful and rude. He really needs to treat this like a job and be more professional. He’s really doing too much and it’s disappointing."
3965,2020-08-20 16:31:29,id7net,They're not. They're just rabid for more James Charles drama and LC is just a vehicle for it.
3966,2020-08-20 15:07:00,id7net,Maybe nostalgia? Dunno really though. Her makeup looks are pretty generic lipstick/eyeliner.
3967,2020-08-20 17:13:55,id7net,I think it’s more of a vibe and fantasy. Fantasy of OC beach girl California dreaming type of thing.
3968,2020-08-20 22:11:33,id7net,"Nostalgia for sure - I won't buy anything from her brand, but she definitely was pretty iconic back in the day so him saying she has no place in the makeup world was just straight up incorrect."
3969,2020-08-20 18:56:08,id7net,"Don’t forget the Hills tho that was really the show. And I felt like it was allll about her or at least centered around her. I think it got big because of the worldwide imagination of what a California beach girl is and she epitomized it so well whilst having a very vanilla marketable personality. I’ll give it to her she’s been able to stay outta drama for the most part, aside from the Spencer’s and Stephanie drama, which aided in the show."
3970,2020-08-20 15:18:23,id7net,"Hey! Even as a sorority girl, her style isn’t ours, but most sorority girls are huge Lilly Pulitzer people not Lauren Conrad. I have no issue with people pushing out brands and stuff, it’s not hurting me, I just don’t spend money on stuff I don’t need.. people take shit so personally all the time lol"
3971,2020-08-20 18:37:36,id7net,"i haven't even thought about lauren conrad in years, but i can't deny she had impact at some point, and she's been working in the beauty industry for a while. i don't really think james had any place to say she has no business owning a beauty brand when she's been in the beauty game longer than he has, even if her style is basic as fuck or stereotypical sorority girl

like, i know the whole narrative around lauren in general on BGC just confirms that BGC is a bunch of white women in their 30s even harder, but i also do think a big reason people are pointing out her 'achievements' in style or fashion or are hyping her up (now. i know people were doing it back when her brand got announced which i think was stupid because she's never done anything that revolutionary) is bc james said she had no business in the industry – which i feel like is a detail being slightly neglected in this thread"
3972,2020-08-20 15:05:04,id7net,"Honestly, he probably has never heard of her lol, googled her and saw she was on reality tv shoes years ago. I know my little siblings around that age def don’t know who she is. But I do think he responded over the top."
3973,2020-08-20 15:20:53,id7net,"Honestly, are they *really* nostalgic or are they pretending to be just for this situation? Because I've only seen her mentioned like, once and it was over winged eyeliner."
3974,2020-08-20 14:58:44,id7net,"20-30 something white women are the only ones who are allowed to release makeup. if anyone else tries it's just a CaSh GraB and they're selfish and tone dead for releasing it DuRiNg a PaNdeMic.

edit: i also think it's funny that they're allowed to go on unhinged rants about jackie's candles or alicia keys' makeup but when james does the same he's a misogynist?? half the people dragging james and manny for criticizing AK did the *same damn thing* when her line was officially announced"
3975,2020-08-20 19:35:49,id7net,"Speak for yourself, hunty.  I'm still mad about Assless Chaps Incident."
3976,2020-08-20 11:21:33,id7net,"That PR package made it clear to me that it's a low effort brand, regardless of who owns it.

Even Jaclyn put in the effort to make her PR usable and hairless."
3977,2020-08-20 16:28:02,id7net,For TWO products to be sent like that? The eyeliner and the highlighter? That's kind of a big problem.
3978,2020-08-20 17:51:09,id7net,"oh wow!! Yeah I never realized she was idealized by so many people! Outta the loop there. I guess it would have been different if I had grown up with her?? Romanticizing that CA beach girl fashion magazine image is a really powerful thing! Not unlike Carrie Bradshaw I guess, but since she was a reality star fans felt like they knew her. Just a bit bizarre since no one has talked about her in so long."
3979,2020-08-20 18:20:18,id7net,"it's really not that deep, though. like, i don't understand how he can't just step back and think about how he's got his dream job and he's living in his dream house and brands send him products for *free.* if they accidentally sent him a dud, mistakes happen, it's insane to go on instagram live and rant about that with the same emotional height you'd have if someone backed their car into yours at the end of a bad day. people make mistakes at work?

i just don't have the energy to feel sorry for a multimillionaire ranting next to his swimming pool on ig live about free products being broken and who does and doesn't have any business entering *his* industry man, like i really don't"
3980,2020-08-20 19:47:37,id7net,"When our lady goddess bland sorority style icon Lauren Conrad does it, its “just a mistake”.

If Jackie Aina did it.... that would be a different story."
3981,2020-08-20 11:25:11,id7net,"And it is being talked about. 400+ comments on that thread alone so far, let alone twittter, IG or YouTube. 

I don’t think any of us are *surprised* at how BGC are reacting, their reaction is so wildly disproportional, homophobic and hate-filled - it’s ridiculous and also deserves to be mocked"
3982,2020-08-20 15:46:31,id7net,they'd understand if it was Jaclyn sending out empty packages
3983,2020-08-20 18:23:18,id7net,"i feel like there's a difference between giving a negative review and being, like, a dick about it"
3984,2020-08-20 22:46:59,id7net,"the hypocrisy is what gets my goat. they're bashing james for the same shit they do every day!!!! on the sarah cheung post, one of the top comments is like ""wonder when james is going to speak out against this brand too"" acting like they didn't recently criticize ashley tisdale, selena gomez, addison rae, the d'amelios, wayne goss, and more for starting their own brands.


also, i agree - i'm 24 and i *barely* know who she is. her name sounds vaguely familiar but she's not an ""icon"" to me and if i was any younger i'd probably have no clue who she even was. i find the idea that james owes her something just because she wore makeup first really weird, especially considering he obviously doesn't take inspiration from her natural glam/no makeup makeup looks."
3985,2020-08-20 10:38:16,id7net,He should be grateful that LC sent him empty and broken PR. He's such a misogynist and will never change
3986,2020-08-20 18:14:52,id7net,"srs the thing is like... james unequivocally benefitted from being a man in the makeup industry. for him to talk about women who have, at one time or another, been prominent in the makeup industry the way he did about marlena and now lauren like... it just stinks to me bro. i don't hate james at all and i think the way bgc has treated him has been disgusting, esp during dramageddon 2, but all of this behaviour in conjunction with the fact that he clearly doesn't care about the pandemic at all is just undeniably not a good look like im sorry but it isnt"
3987,2020-08-20 23:21:57,id7net,I literally can’t even read those threads anymore because people get so nasty. How can they say they’re sick of him while also giving posts about him the most attention?
3988,2020-08-20 22:09:57,id7net,"I think she also handled it perfectly and made him look way worse, too. She took ownership of the mistake instead of placing blame on someone else and was very gracious."

3990,2020-08-20 15:22:22,id7net,"I'm looking at it and it's just like, berry lipsticks and a nude palette and blush that you can get anywhere? But there's no comments saying it's boring and not needed like they do with every other launch."
3991,2020-08-21 04:57:25,id7net,It was the same vibes Becca had before they got bought out by Estee Lauder.
3992,2020-08-20 19:35:38,id7net,"Lol the Spencer’s! 
And yea it was a pretty big show at the time. I mean all power to her for starting her brand. It’s just funny how she’s likes everyone’s fave person now when before no one was thinking about her"
3993,2020-08-20 15:44:58,id7net,"Hahah tbh I don’t know much about sorority girl style I was just thinking of typical white girl outfits which is what Lc kinda does. But seriously I’ve been googling her and do not understand why people think she’s a style icon, these outfits just look like stuff regular people wear"
3994,2020-08-20 18:51:15,id7net,"Oh yea, I don’t agree that he has authority on who gets to be in the beauty business at all. 

I just don’t see why her line has so much more defense than every single other line out there. Especially when it’s such basic products."
3995,2020-08-20 15:31:48,id7net,"The nostalgia for LC seems really intense in there rn but I figured I felt that way bc I just didn’t get it. I was 2-3 yrs just outside main the LB/Hills demo at the time I think? Like I remember my 14 year old cousin being obsessed with Laguna Beach whereas I was watching Real World reruns. So LC never had nearly the effect or influence on my life she seems to have had for every second person in BGC. The patron saint of beauty advice?? Not my personal experience at all, so that was surprising to read. I honestly had no idea so many ppl followed her! Or that she was people’s style touchstone bc exactly as you say - I haven’t seen her mentioned in years and even then it was mostly bc of her Kohl’s line. The nostalgia is definitely strong! I wonder if it’s just for this situation...."
3996,2020-08-20 21:39:38,id7net,Why would remind us about that?
3997,2020-08-20 20:35:44,id7net,"Lauren Conrad responded on Twitter that she put together a gift bag of empty packaging to make sure it all fit, and that’s what James accidentally got. Seems like an honest mistake."
3998,2020-08-20 18:40:44,id7net,"Who's feeling sorry for him? I agree it's not that deep. Certainly not deep enough to warrant the paragraphs upon paragraphs people are writing to rip into him in the main sub. That's my whole point though. Like, he's annoyed. I get annoyed and go and rant on my instagram too. It was an annoying mistake that caused annoyance."
3999,2020-08-20 15:24:48,id7net,"I call them all homophobic and I literally get jumped and downvoted to the 9th circle of hell. It's exactly what it is, and maybe it's a subconcious thing for them but that doesn't change it."
4000,2020-08-20 11:33:30,id7net,"Obviously he doesn’t deserve hate or homophobic comments, that goes without saying. But he made the video and it opened up the conversation. And I think my point still stands that you can’t just compare a consumer’s thoughts about oversaturation to him receiving an empty PR package. Everyone is allowed to have an opinion regarding the products they consume, and people will have opinions on those opinions..."
4001,2020-08-20 16:22:57,id7net,Or Jackie Aina.
4002,2020-08-20 23:01:42,id7net,She does a Youtube video where she shits on the makeup she used to do on herself during her reality tv star days and it's funny that people are bending over backwards and calling it iconic when the woman herself hates seeing her own makeup lol
4003,2020-08-20 10:43:12,id7net,They gate keep more than JC does 😂
4004,2020-08-20 20:21:22,id7net,"srs Agreed. It's true a lot like to jump on him if he breathes wrong, but this wasn't a good look for him considering last week he was dragging Alicia Keys as well. 

There has to be room to criticize without also being a douche about it."

I don’t watch reality shows so I don’t really know about all these reality stars people know. It definitely feels hypocritical that she gets to release a makeup line with no scrutiny when other people don’t. Like what makes her so special? (Not saying everyone with a makeup line deserves hate, I’ll judge the line when it comes out not preemptively)"
4010,2020-08-20 18:49:23,id7net,"i totally get that. but he's someone with a platform and influence like i just don't think it's responsible of him at all, nor is it above criticism. rant on your finsta to your friends, y'know? it's different when you're so influential. people shouldn't be going on hate-filled tirades for sure, but i understand how, after the alicia keys shit and the pandemic apathy, people are frustrated"
4011,2020-08-20 16:32:04,id7net,that sub is so disgusting and hypocritical in how they treated jackie's brand vs LCs. so it's okay for them to make all sorts of assumptions about jackie's brand even before it was released but it's not okay for james to point out a legitimate QA problem? their racism and homophobia is showing
4012,2020-08-21 05:25:44,id7net,Srs. Of course she does. She was 18 when she was on The Hills. I cringe the fuck out when I see my stupid attempts at winged liner in my late teens early 20s because hooded eyes lol.
4013,2020-08-20 17:18:11,id7net,"Oh I’m not saying it’s bad or ugly at all some of her outfits are cute, just in a very basic way, like not trend setting or pushing any boundary. Just literally a regular blouse and jeans or an A line dress with a blazer. Which is completely fine, just confuses me why she’s being hailed as a style icon for wearing the same things everyone else does"
4014,2020-08-20 17:23:45,id7net,That’s exactly the aesthetic lol u got it. She must have a great marketing team  is my only logic here.

For the second time in the same week, he has gone crazy over people (Alicia Keys and Lauren Conrad) coming out with makeup/skincare brands for some reason. God forbid women are allowed into a female dominated industry with mostly female consumers... He doesn't even have a brand so I don't know what his deal is. 

As for the video, he's having a tantrum over being sent a PR package full of empty products (it was a mistake on Lauren's part and she apologized) which triggered said gatekeeping"
4023,2020-08-21 09:02:46,id64tb,"Ah, thank you!  That's seems like a pretty shitty thing to do on his part."
4024,2020-08-20 06:08:58,id4u1s,"I’ll give you the Logan Paul one for sure, his suicide video definitely was positive. However I will argue that many of the other videos are disingenuous because they are either videos that are apologizing for behavior they previously apologized for but never corrected i.e. Shane Dawson, or they fit a stereotypical format. Often times when you are publicly forced to make an apology, and you don’t see what you did wrong, you’re prone to making a disingenuous apology. And with the way public shaming works these days it focuses more on the aspect of shaming and criticizing rather than trying to point out what is wrong. I think the core message is often undercut by a poor video quality (these folks make well produced, highly polished videos and then film an apology in 480p and unscripted). Idk but to me I feel that many of these people are not genuine, and just don’t want to be fodder for public criticism, and they won’t learn from the experience."
4025,2020-08-20 06:24:32,id4u1s,"An apology video is never genuine if it exists as a response to an internet mob.

Responding to criticism is often genuine, as it looks towards the future and promises change.

Apologies look towards the past and are often little more than fake acting attempts to appease the mob.

The mob knows no reason, it can’t be apologized to. 

The trend that repeats itself almost every time is the mob feels unpowered because they forced an apology video. Then, they take even more aggressive actions.

There are only 2 options, win or lose. 

When a creator stands by what they have said and refuses to apologize, that often brings in a ton of new support. Even if they are banned, other platforms exist and the ban is publicity.

The other option is to leave. Content creation is a very stressful and unstable job. No one can keep this up forever."
4026,2020-08-20 08:57:15,id4u1s,Most of the times they’re only sorry because they got caught doing something bad. It’s almost never genuine.
4027,2020-08-20 08:43:15,id4u1s,"One of your example is contradicting your view:

You are telling us that apologize videos are genuine and in the James Charles example you are telling us literally that it's not genuine and he had to admit something he knew wasn't true."
4028,2020-08-20 13:30:23,id4u1s,"These people are ""personalities"". Their income and relevance depends on being popular and marketable. That's why a lot of their apologies sound like ""I'm sorry this happen, can we go back to y'all loving me again?"". Because that's essentially what they are."
4029,2020-08-20 12:39:47,id4u1s,"you know I have nothing against Pokimane and I think the hate she gets is disgusting and - in most cases - a clear sign of misogyny. However, her apology video seemed really really insincere to me, she basically checked all the boxes that one would expect from a fake apology (such as the overly-sincere tone of her voice... real people usually don't talk like that, that's how people talk in bad, stereotypical movies). I think she shouldn't have apologised at all, given that what she did really wasn't all that bad in the first place."
4030,2020-08-20 06:15:17,id4u1s,"I’m agree with you that public shaming is pretty stupid, but I shane Dawson is A very particular case that was dismantled pretty quickly.
As for most other youtubers, they can’t “correct” what they did. Pewdiepie can’t go back and change when he said the n word, he can only apologize for it in his videos.pokimane can’t go back in time and tell her former self to not say certain things. She can only apologize through the video and personal dms(which she did and don’t call me a simp). You can’t correct anything, just simply apologize to everyone for your actions or privately apologize to specific people you hurt."
4031,2020-08-20 11:48:38,id4u1s,"Exactly apologies can't be coerced. The reason those apologies seems so disingenuous is because it's a business decision. They might know what they did was wrong. But to quote south park randy marsh: ""I said the word only because I thought I would money"" 
  
YouTubers say and do what they think will make them money. That's how they do those inappropriate things in the first place. If they think it's more profitable to apologize they will do so."
4032,2020-08-20 12:08:11,id4u1s,Good point
4033,2020-08-21 01:58:06,id4u1s,"See, that's what I'm saying.

people first say, ""you did horrible things apologize""

Then someone makes a genuine apology and then

people say, ""Hey you didn't have to make an apology you're so fake why were you crying you didn't do anything that bad"""
4034,2020-08-20 12:06:56,id4u1s,"I will say, though, that mistakes from celebrities spread like melting butter on a hot pan. In the time it takes to realize your mistake, realize you were wrong and why, and make a video to publicly apologize, millions of people have already spread your “wrong doing.” YouTubers don’t sit around and wait for comments to pop up and read through 16,000. They have PR reps and moderators that may or may not monitor this sort of thing. A lot of the time, they even have people who cut and edit their video for them.

But it IS hard to determine when an apology is coerced versus genuine. Especially when by the time they see it pop up online, it’s been shared by millions of people in minutes or hours.

And believe me, I’m not defending any negative behavior. I’m just saying, sometimes, you don’t even realize what was wrong until it was pointed out and explained. And at that point, there’s already a mob standing in front of you."

4041,2020-08-20 01:17:28,id0eh9,Why does he feel the need to make comments about actual women who have been in the entertainment industry coming out with make up brands just because they don’t wear full faces yet he supports Addison coming out with one when a lot of these singers or reality TV people have been around make up even just buy photo shoots
4042,2020-08-20 01:41:37,id0eh9,"Honestly if you’re sending PR boxes to huge influencers and they’re EMTPY, then maybe you shouldn’t have a makeup company. How are you going to treat non-famous people if you don’t even send quality products to people who have followings and can help you sell product."
4043,2020-08-20 01:02:04,id0eh9,"I mean if your brand has SO little quality control that you can't even oversee the packages getting sent to the influencers that will arguably make or break your brand, you truly don't have any business owning a makeup brand.

As for calling him ""manic"" its inappropriate to speculate someone's mental health. However James has always been high energy and a fast talker, couple that with frustration and confusion and that's your outcome

4051,2020-08-20 01:48:56,id0eh9,The colour of the tube and eyeliner pen is the exact same as Lauren Conrad’s upcoming brand. This is interesting because the general consensus seemed to be excitement for her brand. So we’ll see how this launch goes!
4052,2020-08-20 01:07:38,id0eh9,There's a difference between gatekeeping and calling someone out for sending out incomplete product. If a brand has this little quality control I don't even want to know what the factory sanitization is like or how poorly the other products are formulated.
4053,2020-08-20 01:06:31,id0eh9,Lauren Conrad’s brand
4054,2020-08-20 00:56:26,id0eh9,Is that confirmed or speculated?
4055,2020-08-20 01:48:49,id0eh9,That's my guess. The color of the tubes seems to suit the color vibe on their instagram page.

Tbh if it is Selena, or any celebrity, I feel like most of them have so much exposure to excellent products and excellent makeup artists for such a long time that it's not that weird for them to have a makeup line."
4064,2020-08-20 00:22:40,iczwcp,"James posts on Instagram about PR he received that was defective- the highlighter bottle was just a piece of plastic and the eyeliner had no ink in it.

People should learn elementary math and become comfortable with concepts of statistics, probability, linear algebra and so on. If the basics are built on a strong foundation of Mathematics, people will be able to able to appreciate the beauty of data science even more. 

Just like the sciences - data science is about experimentation and empirical observations. The science part of it nudges us to be “scientific” in our approach to Analytics. But the tools you work with in order to set up the data science are majorly the tools that engineers and particularly data analysts are already used to - like sql, databases and such. 

However Analytics and Technology in particular have now evolved to a level where in the recent times we are witnessing the convergence of diverse areas such as Programming, Mathematics and Science into the single domain called data science. 

I hope you have fun in learning this evolving skill 🙏"

I think this was it"
4074,2020-08-20 13:31:41,icy35c,"You’re right. Number theory was stated in error. Probability, Statistics, linear algebra is good. This wasn’t meant to be an exhaustive coverage of the prerequisites for data science. I thank you for pointing out the error."
4075,2020-08-20 14:21:19,icy35c,"Oh you’re fine. I didn’t even mean to suggest it was an error. I way over did it in undergrad and did about 30 math classes in a semester based system. I never took number theory but I took many algebra classes. I was kind of stunned when you said number theory because I immediately went to some of the number theory things I know of and was puzzled as to how they relate to DS at all. Not saying there couldn’t possibly be connections, I just didn’t see any. Specifically I was thinking of arithmetic in finite fields or something."
4076,2020-08-20 14:29:20,icy35c,"You know - in this fast paced world of today - I find it very humbling that someone actually takes the time - not just to read but also to provide helpful nudges, direction, suggestions and so on. So foremost, I wanted to thank you for your time and the nudge.

Equally importantly it helped make my answer better. I had meant number theory in the sense of discrete maths perhaps. But as things stand, number theory isn’t in the same league at all as stats and probability theory for instance insofar as data science is concerned. 

It’s quite another thing that people can still get quite far as it is without scarcely realising whatever it is they are dabbling with 🙏"

4165,2020-08-20 13:39:18,icphi6,Pinehurst was originally a health resort for the middle-class. It became a golf club several years after it was established.
4166,2020-08-19 20:49:27,icphi6,It was July 4th weekend and No 2 was at that time only a winter play course so couldn't play it.  Frankly I don't remember.  I remember the old hotel the American Plan with great food and the guys they partnered me with but don't really remember the course.  I think there were only 5 or so at that time.

4176,2020-08-19 01:27:34,ice6hv,"He was gonna lead into a more interesting conversation imo about how in his opinion Bucks and OKC (not sure if OKC tries to, don't watch them that much) try to play similar to Houston, but don't have the iso player to fall back on or something. Would have been interesting to hear what Chuck had to say about that, but they got fixated on his statement about Harden to once again have the 1028575th debate about the best 1v1 player."

4181,2020-08-19 01:27:57,ice6hv,"Morey said this 2+ years ago and was instantly flamed by the media and called a homer. 

Don’t get me wrong, Morey has a constant hard-on for Harden but interesting now that the media is starting to pick up on this. 

Harden definitely has an argument. He’s truly unstoppable."
4182,2020-08-19 02:12:23,ice6hv,"It's an interesting discussion because I get both sides.  I think Jordan and Kobe in this era would be taking more 3s, and knowing how they were as players, they'd find a way to become good 3 pt shooters.

But we can't really know for sure... it's possible that they wouldn't be able to maintain good efficiency on the same volume Harden shoots at.  Imo, those 3 are all in the same tier when it comes to individual scoring (not in terms of their overall game, of course)."
4183,2020-08-19 01:28:48,ice6hv,"Harden is definitely top 3, I think I’d still put MJ and Kobe over him however"
4184,2020-08-19 01:43:59,ice6hv,Lol what's everyone on about. That's a fair take. It's not like he's claiming Harden is the goat or anything.
4185,2020-08-19 04:01:50,ice6hv,"Um, how about the dude sitting across from you? Who could stop Shaq 1 on 1?"
4186,2020-08-19 01:34:33,ice6hv,I think prime KD is on that level too tbh. But I guess it pretty debatable who is better
4187,2020-08-19 01:43:46,ice6hv,"i disagreee but IFUCKING HATE the ""because they didnt have to shoot 3 pointers"" argument. well ok harden would be a lock down defender like michael jordan  back then because nowadays he doesnt have to do it and is just resting on defense. i mean thats how they argue. fuck outta here with that shit. kobe shot plenty of 3 ponters and harden is better at that. tired of the different era bias that only seems to to work one way with these boomers"
4188,2020-08-19 02:06:11,ice6hv,"Annoying when people argue that players from a previous generation would’ve been great high volume 3 point shooters if they played in this generation. I mean maybe, but it’s 100% speculation. Lots of great mid range shooters could just never get a consistent 3 point shot."
4189,2020-08-19 07:30:06,ice6hv,people don’t realize that he is talking about 1v1 in game situation? I agree with Chuck. You really can’t stop Harden when its 1v1
4190,2020-08-19 01:49:12,ice6hv,"Honestly, just on size alone I’d take KD over anyone in the league."

4192,2020-08-19 04:47:40,ice6hv,God these debates are so pointless. Nobody can ever know for certain who the best 1v1 player of all time is. So let the man give his opinion and finish his statement
4193,2020-08-19 13:43:02,ice6hv,"Jordan and Kobe could beat Harden because of their defense. But imo Harden is a better shooter and his handle is better too.

I don't think that he's a better player nor he beats them 1-on-1 but offensively imo he's better than them 1-on-1 if that make sense lmao"
4194,2020-08-19 01:34:49,ice6hv,He really is. He can do anything he wants vs anybody. He’s unstoppable unless you bring help which may slow him down but not stop him. He’ll just kick to the open man when he draws the double.
4195,2020-08-19 13:45:46,ice6hv,"usually these discussions end up on the same fucking problem:

they romanticize their era so much that they will trample any quality player's achievements becuz ""era"". I rememebr that episode of Open Court where they dismissed Steve Nash. They said he wouldnt be good in ""their era"". Ridiculous. They can't talk about a good player without bringing up era.

If you have 1 possession and you need a bucket and you got to pick a player to iso, I pick MJ 100 out of 100 times.  The thing that made MJ so intimidating and allowed him to control the game is that he put the ball in the basket *so fucking often* that it was demoralizing.

If you give them say, 5 or 10 possessions and come up with who scores the most points, then Harden has a shot."

And I agree with that assessment..... under the condition a referee is present to call touch fouls.  


If it was ""no blood no foul street rules"".... there are probably better 1 on 1 players than Harden."
4211,2020-08-19 13:44:00,ice6hv,"Nah. Kobe, Jordan, Durant, probably several others from the past as well would all beat him 1v1

4214,2020-08-19 02:28:14,ice6hv,Couldn't disagree more. I've seen Harden foul-bait instead of trying to get a shot off in critical possessions in the playoffs. Can't be considered top 5 when that's your go-to in the highest pressure situations.
4215,2020-08-19 03:34:29,ice6hv,"He can't take you to the post and back you down. Gotta go kobe, jordan or carmelo."
4216,2020-08-19 01:31:34,ice6hv,"Meh. He's not even the best 1v1 player today. He's a mediocre defender, and while he's a complete offensive maestro, you have to play defense in 1v1 .... 

I'd take guys like KD, Kawhi, and LeBron over Harden any day in a 1v1 matchup.

All time? I think it's MJ, but Wilt would be damn unstoppable too because of his size."
4217,2020-08-19 01:50:34,ice6hv,"they do that shit all the time and it's so frustrating. like if they're gonna shit on him, fine, but at least let him get to where he's going with his thought"
4218,2020-08-19 02:58:06,ice6hv,"Honestly if instead of going 'best 1 on 1 ever' he stated 'best 1 on 1 ever, behind the arc' then he probably would have been able to speak more. But its just the usual dick-riding they do of MJ and Kobe because of 'era'"
4219,2020-08-19 04:17:32,ice6hv,"Honestly every team has a system that needs an iso player to fall back on if the going gets tough. Bulls and Lakers had the triangle with MJ and Kobe, Warriors with their pass to the open man mindset with KD. So on and so forth."

4238,2020-08-19 02:47:12,ice6hv,"No, Morey said Harden is the best offensive player ever. Significant difference as that accounts assists/playmaking as well, which Harden is certainly better than MJ/Kobe at."
4239,2020-08-19 06:37:47,ice6hv,Coaches and GMs get bashed for making ultra high praise comments for their players even though it often turns out to be true. So many people thought Marc Jackson was out of his mind calling Klay and Steph the best shooting back court in history.

Kobes shooting technique didn't lend itself to hit 3s at a high volume and from deep, same with Jordan"
4243,2020-08-19 07:33:03,ice6hv,but Kobe and Jordan are not from this era so its irrelevant if they would shoot more 3s. Its like saying “if I were 7ft tall I would be the best player” but you are 5’9. Who cares about hypothetical scenarios
4244,2020-08-19 12:09:44,ice6hv,I’m not sure MJ would have taken too many more threes. I remember him saying that he didn’t like shooting threes because it seemed to take a bit of his edge off. He didn’t have the same aggression if he just sat at the three point line.
4245,2020-08-19 01:31:48,ice6hv,Why kobe?
4246,2020-08-19 08:43:15,ice6hv,"Also within the context it's pretty clear Chuck is talking best 1 on 1 offensive player. Of course you can assume MJ would have benefited from the era, but the reality is we've never seen someone with this combination of shooting, dribbling, passing and getting to the line. Basically the perfect one man offense."
4247,2020-08-19 14:20:29,ice6hv,"Hakeem, Bill Russel, Wilt, etc. Shaq is great but footwork is not a skill he ever really had."

4270,2020-08-19 02:42:17,ice6hv,So stupid. Kobe would destroy Harden in his prime.
4271,2020-08-19 02:29:15,ice6hv,Kobe would just post him up over and over again. Same with Michael.

4273,2020-08-19 19:04:44,ice6hv,So you nephews realize that one on one requires defense?  Harden is an average defender.  Prime Kobe was one of the best perimeter defenders in the league.
4274,2020-08-19 03:20:15,ice6hv,"Counterpoint: don't none of y'all know what a 1 v 1 matchup looks like, apparently. It's not played the same as an ISO possession. And if you want to argue Harden is the best ISO player, that shits still wrong because Prime T-Mac was a thing."
4275,2020-08-19 07:52:41,ice6hv,"I'm sorry...

No fucking way.

Harden has found a way to abuse the system with getting fouls called on him and the ability to expertly gather the ball while taking 24 steps... Those two things combined makes players fear even getting remotely close to him and it allows for him to just do whatever he wants.

But on a 1 on 1... it's Kobe in his prime vs harden in his prime?

Hardens handles can't even come close to Kobe's finesse. How is this even a question?"
4276,2020-08-19 04:49:48,ice6hv,"We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.

People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.

The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer: you didn't watch him in his prime.

Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.

And because you didn't watch him in his prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But here's the thing: basketball isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up ""true shooting percentage"" or ""win shares"" I know they know nothing about basketball.

Kobe's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. He's the second greatest SG ever, and one of the 5 best players to ever play the game.

So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time, so I know that Kobe is better.

You might be jealous of Kobe's five rings, or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history, or whatever. Unless you're a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the 90s, or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the 2000s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win basketball looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.

This sub would make you think that Kobe isn't even a top 100 player ever.

So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your ""greats"" like LeBron James The Best Player in the World™, but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair?"
4277,2020-08-19 09:18:56,ice6hv,"You do realize harden, a SG, is the best post defender in the league right?"

4282,2020-08-19 04:36:14,ice6hv,"Honestly, if you were here his first season in Houston, you'd remember how the sub respected him about 3/4 through that first year and it grew almost exponentially until that defense video came out. When the trade went down and the two years prior he was seen as a secondary ball handler 3nD guy by most. It's weird to see his career arc. 

He wasn't seen as the ""foul baiter with no defense"" until his 3rd houston season when the team went to the WCF. Then the disappointment that was 2016 basically secured this image of him today.

EDIT: The hate was there in the finals too. As if the rest of his playoffs that year were nonexistent."
4283,2020-08-19 01:56:59,ice6hv,"When you can hit step back 3s at good %, why is better to go for those less efficient moves?"

4287,2020-08-19 01:32:53,ice6hv,bc kobe is jordan light and MJ himself said kobe might have beaten him in a 1v1
4288,2020-08-19 01:33:55,ice6hv,Oh no reason just literally every elite basketball player saying kob was the hardest one on one player. You know nothing big.
4289,2020-08-19 01:55:18,ice6hv,"I think Kobe had a more varied 1 on 1 game vs. Harden. 

Kobe literally could do everything on offense though he lacked premium efficiency. Harden has mastered the step back and the drive but post up and mid range are behind Kobe (for good reason)."
4290,2020-08-19 02:58:08,ice6hv,Exactly!
4291,2020-08-19 02:03:50,ice6hv,I know but it’s also KD lol
4292,2020-08-19 01:31:13,ice6hv,harden got wrecked by a standard basketball rim

4300,2020-08-19 06:46:04,ice6hv,You don’t think Steph or KD could average 36 on  a team built like the rockets where the entire offense is built just for them? Steph averaged 30 on stupid efficiency and that was while sitting out most 4th quarters.
4301,2020-08-19 02:34:55,ice6hv,KD led his team to the finals lol
4302,2020-08-19 08:30:03,ice6hv,KD has led his own team and could absolutely average 36 if he had to lol. This is one of the dumbest comments I've seen
4303,2020-08-19 16:46:30,ice6hv,How in the fuck did this get upvotes? Did everyone forget about KD's MVP season where Westbrook was injured?
4304,2020-08-19 02:35:47,ice6hv,"He absolutely could if he needed to. You really don’t believe he couldn’t?

Cmon"
4305,2020-08-19 04:24:20,ice6hv,shit on KD's persona all u want but hes definitely up there as one of the greatest iso players of all time. dude is a 7 foot myplayer cheat code
4306,2020-08-19 03:56:09,ice6hv,"Kobe wasn’t that long ago. Lots of us watched his entire career.

Regarding the discussion - I mean, does one on one mean no one else on the court? If so, give me Shaq over Jordan. He’ll just back him down and dunk. I’m kidding obviously but this is just such a silly debate. 

I think Harden can score just as well as Jordan/Kobe. Game on the line, give me Jordan or Kobe (but that’s a different question)"
4307,2020-08-19 03:19:46,ice6hv,1 on 1....I got Kobe all day..every day.
4308,2020-08-19 04:53:57,ice6hv,"that's not his point. I think he means only offense. Obviously Kobe would destroy him 1 on 1. He is talking about give the guy the ball and watch him go. I watched a ton of Kobe and a bit of Mike at the end but James has so many more options than the other two like Chuck is saying. Also for team basketball it means Harden can iso from the top much more effectively which is a better spot to initiate the offence than the mid post, where Kobe and MJ did most of their best iso work."
4309,2020-08-19 03:15:20,ice6hv,"Idk I don't think people realize the volume Harden iso's at and the efficiency in which he does it. I don't know Kobe's iso stats, but for example this year Harden is at 14 isos a game (2nd is 7 a game and then 3rd drops to under 5) and gets 1.12ppp and last year he had 16 isos a game at 1.11ppp, 2 years ago 10 attempts at 1.22ppp. That's absurdly good and Kobe was closer to 1ppp on fewer attempts (on the little amount of stats I can find on him). Kobe's 2 highest iso seasons were 998 and 891 so those were around Harden attempts, but less than Harden this year on a per game basis.

Whether or not Kobe is better at it, it is not delusional to think Harden is above him.

1on1 in a real game is more relevant than some 1on1 pickup game."
4310,2020-08-19 15:36:14,ice6hv,"I hate when people try to make the argument that anyone young is ignorant, it's just lazy.  Harden is a better shooter with better range; Kobe was the mid-range master, but Harden can score from anywhere."
4311,2020-08-19 03:07:31,ice6hv,Lol
4312,2020-08-19 02:10:30,ice6hv,It’s NBA basketball at least 3 refs are watching at any given moment 😂
4313,2020-08-19 02:38:19,ice6hv,Nephew found
4314,2020-08-19 02:51:47,ice6hv,Isn't that what Harden wants?
4315,2020-08-19 04:44:17,ice6hv,"In the context of the clip, Chuck is clearly talking about iso... He says the Thunder and Bucks run the same drive and kick as the Rockets do, but aren't as successful at it because they don't have as good of an iso superstar. He wasn't literally talking 1v1. That means fuck all in the course of a real basketball game. A true 1v1 can happen in very specific situations in transition, or post-ups...

Prime TMac sure but there are wasn't great stat tracking for him, at that point I'd also include '16 Curry and it becomes a useless conversation. Dude scored 1.4 PPP on shots from 30+ feet. If you pick him up from all the way up there, he gets a high screen or dribbles by you and turns the possession into a 5 on 4, which is pretty much how ISO is used anyway."
4316,2020-08-19 08:12:22,ice6hv,Is this CopyPasta?
4317,2020-08-19 16:01:14,ice6hv,"Defending bigs, tho. Harden gets those numbers defending 4’s and 5’s, not 2’s and 3’s. 

He handles guys that rely on overpowering him really well. MJ and Kobe wouldn’t be trying to dump truck him tho."
4318,2020-08-19 16:11:17,ice6hv,"I had this take actually, Harden is certainly a really good post defender but do you think it would matter against Jordan? 

I certainly don't think Jordan can guard harden because offense always beats defense but who would slow each other down more?"
4319,2020-08-19 16:07:42,ice6hv,TBF that man is not built like a SG
4320,2020-08-19 01:33:25,ice6hv,Yeah Kawhi is not up there lol

4322,2020-08-19 01:38:33,ice6hv,fair
4323,2020-08-19 01:38:04,ice6hv,Kawhi scored 30+ ppg on 60+ TS% throughout the whole of last year playoffs while being regularly double and triple teamed. What more does he need to do lol. Thats up with any of Kobes post seasons
4324,2020-08-19 01:38:24,ice6hv,"true

but he was insane on offense getting doubled/tripled by philly last year even if it wasn’t that flashy

and is one of the greatest perimeter defenders ever"
4325,2020-08-19 16:03:11,ice6hv,Because situationally they can be more efficient.
4326,2020-08-19 03:18:24,ice6hv,Because his space is getting bodied up in a 1 v 1.  There's a lot of talk in this thread conflating iso player with heads-up match. These are different things.

4334,2020-08-19 01:45:32,ice6hv,Which means....what? Why does Jordan’s opinion of Kobe mean anything when talking about Harden being better 1 on 1?
4335,2020-08-19 02:11:21,ice6hv,Barkley was an elite basketball player
4336,2020-08-19 02:08:56,ice6hv,At the same time mid range and post up are inefficient shots. There's no reason to use them if your step back 3 and drive are working so well.
4337,2020-08-19 02:00:47,ice6hv,"Yea i see where you’re coming from. I just think that even tho harden doesnt post up, his iso game is far too good where i can look past it."
4338,2020-08-19 02:45:31,ice6hv,"Harden better one on one than KD, but also, I am biased cause I think KD weak af."
4339,2020-08-19 01:33:45,ice6hv,Wade and Lebron owned the same prince
4340,2020-08-19 01:41:18,ice6hv,Use context clues my man. He's talking about why Houston's offense works and Milwaukee and OKCs doesn't: because CP3 and Giannis aren't as great of individual **offensive** players as Harden. He's using 1-on-1 here interchangeablely with Iso.
4341,2020-08-19 04:47:23,ice6hv,Bruh you dumb as hell
4342,2020-08-19 15:09:59,ice6hv,"how though? no one is saying harden had a better career than Jordan but like how can anyone say that Jordan would have been a better shooter than Harden if he played today?

Players like Miller existed even back then and honestly if those coaches weren't smart enough to realize that 3>2 especially when you're getting bodied in the paint...but oh cmon

the reason Jordan never became a 3 point shooter is bc he wasn't a good shooter. 

these kinds of comments piss me off bc people want to act like Jordan had something that would make him the best in any era...like nah man he was a super motivated and driven player but he's just a dude. 

do i think jordan would have been a better scorer than harden today? idk i think its just as stupid to say harden would have been a better scorer as the opposite"
4343,2020-08-19 11:53:25,ice6hv,Oh I didn't know Jordan was a millennial
4344,2020-08-19 12:05:49,ice6hv,Absolutely nothing lmao
4345,2020-08-19 08:20:35,ice6hv,"Another thing that is underrated about Harden is his durability. I doubt Steph could do what Harden has season after season and avoid injury, same goes for KD."
4346,2020-08-19 07:44:55,ice6hv,"That last sentence is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO underrated.

Steph getting sat out the 4th quarter (because every other game was a blow out) has to probably be the single most painful thing that keeps him up at night.

Had that man played in most of the 4th quarter games where he was sat (sometimes even sat in the 3rd quarter), we would have seen a fuck ton of 70+ point games EASY and a WAYYY Crazier career stat wise. 

All these other players put up crazy number WHILE playing in the 4th

CURRY did it IN THREE FUCKING QUARTERS.

That shit will forever be looked over."
4347,2020-08-19 15:53:45,ice6hv,"I’m not convinced Steph could average 36 if the offense was literally ‘here’s the ball now go create 50 points for us’.

Steph could score like that in a system built for him. A huge portion of Steph’s success is from playing off the ball. 

Harden doesn’t have a system, really. It’s literally just 5 out spacing in isolation with the occasional hand-off or PnR, but he gets blitzed on basically every PnR now anyway.

It’s a system in the sense that there’s a set of principles that drive it but there’s no offensive scheme. It’s just Harden creating offense in space, and usually doing it by himself."
4348,2020-08-19 04:05:47,ice6hv,The team with 2 super stars/future MVPs that got embarrassed in the finals?

4352,2020-08-19 17:42:36,ice6hv,Chill. He didn’t average 36. Russ played more than half the season. KD only played 27 games in the season after that. Doing it for one year doesn’t prove anything imo
4353,2020-08-19 02:37:35,ice6hv,I don’t care if he could — I care if he did. Not talking hypotheticals. Who knows if his body can handle that much usage?
4354,2020-08-19 03:03:36,ice6hv,KD literally went to GS because he did not want to be #1 option on offense.
4355,2020-08-19 04:13:29,ice6hv,"You are underestimating how many nephews are on here. I’m talking prime Kobe, not 2016 Kobe. 

I’m just saying, I think Kobe is better 1 on 1 than Harden is. I’m taking Kobe every time."

4357,2020-08-19 03:20:52,ice6hv,All day no doubt. I barley got to watch MJ so it’s hard for me to pick him. Saw Kobe tho and that man was a demon 1 on 1 lol
4358,2020-08-19 15:27:54,ice6hv,"Harden is a better shooter with better range, seems like a no-brainer to me..."
4359,2020-08-19 15:57:57,ice6hv,"Yeah, I think the phrasing was too broad. 

Harden is the best isolation player ever, and maybe also the best iso scorer. That’s not even close to the same as playing 1 on 1."
4360,2020-08-19 03:16:23,ice6hv,Just going off all the greats who say Kob the best one on one.  Ain't heard nobody but stats nerds and drunk uncle Charles talk about Harden like that.
4361,2020-08-19 03:23:37,ice6hv,"ISO isn't the same as 1 v 1. ISO both players still worry about the offensive and defensive schemes, which changes things significantly. 

Heads-up is a much more hypothetical thing to consider, but any student of the game is gonna recognize the difference. 

Best ISO player ever was pre-ankle injury T-Mac, my mind will not be swayed on this. It was a different game you can't just compute out bball ref numbers and ignore the changes in the way the game is called."
4362,2020-08-19 10:30:52,ice6hv,I don't think you understand Kobe was in his prime when defense was actually allowed.
4363,2020-08-19 03:47:44,ice6hv,"Who would you rather have :

Kobe defending Harden 

Harden defending Kobe

Remember, iso isn't 1v1. ISO in a game, you can think about passing threat, getting help defense, breaking that 2nd line . etc"
4364,2020-08-19 17:14:53,ice6hv,"It's not the age that makes it ignorant,  it's the complete lack of fundamental truth that makes it ignorant.  Kobe had no flaws in his offensive game and could do anything from anywhere.  The 00s playstyles didnt flow into this hyper efficient bait fouls and jack up 3s to produce a high TS%. And offense is only half a 1 on 1 game. Kobe could lock up anyone in defense as well. Harden is mediocre on his best defensive days."
4365,2020-08-19 02:12:40,ice6hv,"Ain’t no refs in 1 on 1, gotta call your own fouls like a big boy"
4366,2020-08-19 02:44:24,ice6hv,They don't know about Harden in the post.
4367,2020-08-19 02:43:19,ice6hv,Stop. James Harden would have nothing for Kobe.

Kawhi is the better player, Harden is the better offensive player"
4371,2020-08-20 00:28:03,ice6hv,"Let me ask you, does Harden do those other things?  Harden is statistically  the most efficient ISO player in history. He clearly knows math and statics better than the guys before him. Favoring the most efficient move is just math."
4372,2020-08-19 04:05:02,ice6hv,"harden is the best iso player of all time, no question about it. As for best 1 on 1 player, prolly shaq cuz he's big and no one could stop him."
4373,2020-08-19 04:23:52,ice6hv,Step back 3 is probably the best move you can make to create space when you are facing an elite guard. You think it's better to try to cross MJ over?
4374,2020-08-19 14:02:47,ice6hv,Who the hell really thinks about 1v1 when comparing players? That’s irrelevant to actual gameplay. Whenever I heard 1v1 I still assumed they meant offensively going 1 on 1 during a game. So they can either score or creat offense for others Aka ISO ball. Not sure why anyone would discuss some hypothetical game of literally just two players going at it with no teammates. That’s just dumb
4375,2020-08-19 04:20:24,ice6hv,Where'd you find this
4376,2020-08-19 02:03:06,ice6hv,"because i believe jordan is the best 1v1 player of all time, so therefore I would value his opinion of who is possibly better than him"
4377,2020-08-19 02:46:00,ice6hv,Barkley also is known for his outlandish takes. He doesn’t even have Lebron or Kobe in his top 10.
4378,2020-08-19 02:16:33,ice6hv,Not during Kobe’s career
4379,2020-08-19 02:16:38,ice6hv,"You see, that’s what separates Kobe from MJ. 

MJ shot 49.5% on mid range shots in 96-97 (a healthy amount of those probably being post fades). So the math checks out for him to operate in that area. 

In the case of harden, yes a post game would be a waste of time but a mid range jumper couldn’t hurt if he employed it in spurts similar to his old teammate CP3."
4380,2020-08-19 02:19:39,ice6hv,"yes but nobody was thinking about analytics in the 2000's. Watch either of the Lakers-Celtics Finals and you'll be disgusted at how many long 2's were taken

Kobe was still elite relative to his era"

4382,2020-08-19 02:04:47,ice6hv,"Harden pushes efficiency to the max in my opinion (layups and threes) I do think that hurts him in the playoffs sometimes though and that’s why I’d have him (among these three players) second behind MJ. There’s something to be said about being able to get to an 18 foot jumper whenever you want and having the ability to hit it. 

Jordan - super efficient mid range combined with finishing and just enough 3 (relative to era) 

Harden - efficiency to the max

Kobe - can do everything but lacks the efficiency (partially due to shot selection and era) of the other two."

KD most shots per game was 20. 

James Harden was in the perfect position to average 36 points. KD has never been given the opportunity to score 36 a game, and I think that’s obvious.

Btw, the season he averaged 20 shots a game was the season he averaged 32 a game. Give him 4 extra shots and he has 36 Easy.

Downvoted, lmao gotcha /r/NBA"
4400,2020-08-19 03:16:59,ice6hv,Is that an actual fact? Like KD said that himself?
4401,2020-08-19 05:08:27,ice6hv,You don't have much of an argument it seems but alright
4402,2020-08-19 05:10:53,ice6hv,"But that doesn’t really answer the question, what does 1 on 1 even mean? Is this in the playoffs? Is this ability to score in isolation? Ability to score in isolation in the playoffs? Do the two have to play against each other or is it against the same player? 

 If we are looking at stats Kobe’s best Isolation scoring season was in 2006 where he had below 1.09 Ppp on iso plays (I don’t have synergy stats but article says it’s right behind Chris Paul’s 16/17 iso scoring). James harden has had 3 straight seasons of more efficient isolation scoring with 1.22 , 1.11 , 1.12.He’s also achieved this higher efficiency on a high volume as well (kobe highest is ~12possessions per game, while harden has had 14,16 the last 2 seasons)."
4403,2020-08-19 16:05:10,ice6hv,Did not what?
4404,2020-08-19 04:12:33,ice6hv,If you had to go 1 on 3 take Jordan.
4405,2020-08-19 03:21:37,ice6hv,Lmfao
4406,2020-08-19 03:20:35,ice6hv,"Well there aren't public stats to really look at for Kobe, not like we have on Harden anyway. Only solid one is Kobe's last season which was atrocious (not relevant to his better years obviously). And stats are much more reliable than rose tinted nostalgia glasses.

Like I said, Kobe might've been better at it, but to say it's *delusional* to have Harden over him is what's actually delusional."
4407,2020-08-19 07:14:43,ice6hv,uhh Kobe himself stated that he believed harden was the heir apparent after him.
4408,2020-08-19 03:26:53,ice6hv,harden is better 1 on 1. You're delusional
4409,2020-08-19 03:24:50,ice6hv,"But the context is clearly iso. You think Chuck is talking about an actual 1on1 game? Iso is also the one thing that hasn't really changed. Why would iso now be so much different than the mid-2000s. 

My argument isn't who is actually better. It's the blind stans who think Harden isn't even close. I don't even like watching Harden that much but the dude is stupidly good at iso."
4410,2020-08-19 03:48:25,ice6hv,How is that relevant at all? They aren't talking about an actual 1v1 game lol.
4411,2020-08-19 17:35:46,ice6hv,"You saying it lacks truth doesn't make it so.  Harden is a better pure scorer and has more range than Kobe ever did.  It's pretty weak to discredit all of the ways that Harden is statistically better (2p%, 3p%, eFG%, PPG, plus/minus, etc) by using the era argument, also let's not pretend like Kobe didn't get to shoot his fair share of FT's.  You can disagree with the argument without trying to discredit the intelligence of anyone who disagrees with you."
4412,2020-08-19 02:14:33,ice6hv,Oh Lordy. Pretty sure he was talking about 1 on 1 in the context of the NBA but yeah I’m sure he was imagining these guys on a the blacktop.
4413,2020-08-19 02:47:11,ice6hv,Some people just don’t know shit about basketball
4414,2020-08-19 03:05:40,ice6hv,"Snapping his head back like 10,000 volts are coursing through his beard ain't gonna work 1 on 1. Harden looks good in the post because ain't nobody trying to send a post player at him, he's bodying up smaller guards looking to initiate the offense."
4415,2020-08-19 04:59:48,ice6hv,"I mean... hes the leading scorer for the past three seasons in a heavy iso reliant offense. Saying he wouldn't have anything for kobe is just being dismissive. He's obviously one of the best scorers of his era and regularly makes people look extremely foolish in iso scenarios. 

That doesn't mean that Kobe wasn't great in his own right. Honestly seeing who would be more productive in iso would be interesting but the data isn't there during Kobe prime. So we take guesses at who might come out winning that match up. But they would absolutely have moves that would be extremely difficult for the other to deal with."
4416,2020-08-19 01:45:54,ice6hv,I wouldn’t say kawhi is the better player. His defense isn’t what it once was
4417,2020-08-20 01:07:32,ice6hv,"No, he doesn’t, usually, but it’s not because of math. 

His activity level is low off ball because a) he uses so much goddamn energy with the ball and b) the Rockets don’t really need heavy movement off ball, because they play 5 out and have two generational shot creators. 

It doesn’t mean James wouldn’t benefit some by occasionally taking a mid range shot when the rim is well defended, utilizing handoffs more, or cutting backdoor more often. 

Even if it’s just every 6-8 possessions,  situational adaptations are important. Details are important. He’s so good, he doesn’t *need* them. He could still *use* them.

They’ve definitely increased handoff frequency in the bubble, specifically with Jeff Green handing it off to him, and it’s been a super noticeable plus to the offense."
4418,2020-08-19 16:45:44,ice6hv,"> Who the hell really thinks about 1v1 when comparing players?

Literally nobody. It's a cop-out playground argument. ""Yeah, but who would win in a wrestling match!"" would be just as relevant lol

Put Harden 1-on-1 with whoever and he's gonna hit a stepback.

Put Shaq 1-on-1 with whoever and he's gonna back them into oblivion and yam it.

NBA basketball isn't 1-on-1 like that. In the context Chuck was speaking to he was obviously using 1-on-1 in terms of running isos in-game, not two guys playing street ball."
4419,2020-08-19 02:04:17,ice6hv,His opinion on players is absolutely horrendous. See his ownership of the Hornets. Not saying Kobe isn’t great 1 on 1 but Harden is better.
4420,2020-08-19 02:19:08,ice6hv,Are we including the opinions of every elite basketball player or not? Can’t follow your logic dude
4421,2020-08-19 03:06:15,ice6hv,I'd agree with you if this was the older Rockets but watching them play right now there's literally no reason for Harden to shoot mid range shots ever. The system right now is just isoing with 5 shooters. So either he's shooting a step back 3 or blowing by the defender straight to the rim. If there's a help defender he kicks to the open shooter. He's simply never in a position where he ever needs to shoot a mid range in the current system.
4422,2020-08-19 03:14:16,ice6hv,"Two points from range could be a decent shot before the Era of Moving Screens. A huge part of why players didn't take as many threes back then was because clean looks from there were a lot harder to get, and were usually generated from drive and kicks that take time to set. 

The way in which shit gets called on the perimeter has changed drastically in the last 10-15 years. It's ridiculous how everyone acts like it's just because everyone became elite at long range, instead of recognizing the bedrock fact that getting free for a clean look beyond the perimeter is about the easiest thing to do in the game now."
4423,2020-08-19 05:59:14,ice6hv,Even some of the best mid range and post up players are inefficient compared to good 3pt shooters and drivers.
4424,2020-08-19 02:10:20,ice6hv,"Honestly I just don't see the point in an 18 foot jumper unless your in a pick and roll which the Rockets don't do anymore. Especially in a 5 out offense.

Either shoot the 3/step back if the defender is giving you space or drive by them. If the defense helps then kick out to an open shooter."
4425,2020-08-19 11:43:14,ice6hv,"That’s literally why, he pussied out and went to a team that already won a championship. Easiest rode. Thanks for proving my point m8."
4426,2020-08-19 01:40:35,ice6hv,"Wade rocked him the year after then Lebron after that. 

Big kobe fan but he straight looked like a d leaguer vs prince 

Lakers would have won that series if he didn’t play"
4427,2020-08-19 22:40:24,ice6hv,"i agree but in 1v1 defense is VASTLY overrated especially when the players aren't fatigued as fuck. defense almost doesn't matter at all, it's really size that matters and MJ isn't bigger than Harden.

Their handles are a near wash, MJ is the better midrange and driver. Harden is the better shooter and pretty close at getting in. 

they're both the same size and weight, it's hard to call either way. 

Would Jordan's superior ability to get inside propel him to a victory? maybe 

Would Harden's greater range propel him to easier baskets and a victory? maybe.

I'm not saying Harden would beat Jordan for sure like I would say KD would beat Jordan for sure. 

In Jordan's era you also couldn't double team straight up. Harden right now faces a double as soon as he's past half court. Sure no one person could stay in front of MJ, but that's not relevant anymore. As for handchecks, cmon. Watch a full game from the 80s or 90s. With highlights its easy to think the game was brutal but it wasn't always. Obviously MJ got bullied by the Pistons and a few others, but it wasn't always like that. 

If you watch a game from back then today, you'd be surprised by how much of the same bullshit used to be called back then. Not to mention the game had more freethrows back then with a much slower rate of play"
4428,2020-08-19 18:46:48,ice6hv,"i mean biologically lol he's a human. i know he has this aura around him but like he's not some basketball God who could learn to do anything. 

he's a really fucking good baller, prob the best ever. but thats the thing with humanity, we're all constrained in a relatively narrow range.

there's a reason there aren't players who are 9 feet tall or players who can run 30+ mph. there's a range humans can be in, and while NBA players are at the very top of that range, its still a limiting factor."
4429,2020-08-19 16:39:45,ice6hv,Sorry for offending you
4430,2020-08-20 20:45:29,ice6hv,"Dude he is a SHOOTER.

His exhaustion comes from having to run around getting open and people hacking him. You have NBA players who have literally said he can practically run forever and he's crazy hard to catch. He has a wicked amount of stamina. Problem is, he has some pretty weak bones and gets injured NOT FROM MUSCLE TEARING, but from bone injuries (knee, ankle, shoulder, etc.). So yes, the rest does indeed help.

However, he could have easily played on those blowout games and dropped 70+ EASY. I'm not saying playing EVERY single 4th quarter. I'm referring to the blowout games specifically."
4431,2020-08-19 08:32:00,ice6hv,"Which is why i also understand why he was sat.

Shit fucking sucks"
4432,2020-08-19 18:05:30,ice6hv,"> Curry needs a system, 

I didn’t and wouldn’t say that.

Curry would need a system to produce *at Harden’s level.* I’m sure he could roll out of bed and find a way to 25-28 pts and 6 assists. 

There’s nobody else in the league that could go earn you 50 pts a night without ever calling a play or running an action."
4433,2020-08-19 16:49:59,ice6hv,"Its ridiculous to imply Curry ""needs"" a system to be a great scorer tbh.

It also just makes no sense to act like playing in a system that is specifically designed to exploit his once in a lifetime skillset and use it at will against other teams somehow makes him a lesser scorer. 

Like, I'm not trying to argue Harden vs Curry because honestly I don't give a shit, but Curry does not ""need"" anything but himself to be great, and the whole ""system"" thats being referred to here can only exist because he is who he is. Harden will never do what Curry did in 2016, system or not."
4434,2020-08-19 07:21:13,ice6hv,Except defensively.
4435,2020-08-19 05:26:32,ice6hv,Tell em!  People are so caught up with recency bias!
4436,2020-08-19 07:33:55,ice6hv,"I’ve never looked at Harden as the better player than KD but I’ve been a firm believer that Harden is the better offensive player between the two. 

Harden’s led some, at times, lack luster rosters  to some decent playoff runs throughout his 8 years in Houston. KD always had Russ to fall back on so of course he never really needed to take so many shots or be as ball dominant as Harden. We all know Harden’s averaged 34+ points 2 straight seasons but it seems many forget just how phenomenal harden is at facilitating. Dude averaged 29 points and a league leading 11 assists (and 8 rebounds), playing 81 games, carrying Houston to the 3rd seed with the second best player being Eric Gordon. I’ve watched a lot of Rocket basketball over the years and you could just tell something was different about James from his first game in Detroit. Always plays with a certain level of confidence and makes scoring the ball look so easy. Easy to the point where people always try to find the flaws in his game. Truly a player that people won’t appreciate until years down the way."
4437,2020-08-19 07:15:54,ice6hv,He had a smaller role and was way younger AND balled out against he spurs in the wcf. But I agree durant is better than harden at their peaks
4438,2020-08-19 03:06:23,ice6hv,[deleted]
4439,2020-08-19 02:54:04,ice6hv,"he was a multiple-time scoring champ, mvp, and went to the finals all before golden state."
4440,2020-08-19 03:04:31,ice6hv,"We actually have a half-season sample size of this. 2014 when Russ was hurt and KD won MVP.

35.0 Pts, 7.5 Reb, 6.3 Ast, 1.3 Stl, 0.7 Blk, 22.4 FGA, 10.1 FTA, .652 TS

Very similar to Harden's carry job, though slightly different based on their differing styles. Durant is a little more efficient while Harden is more of a playmaker. Of course, this is just a 30 game sample, and Harden has a *four season, 300 game* run of

32.4 Pts, 6.7 Reb, 8.8 Ast, 1.8 Stl, 0.7 Blk, 21.4 FGA, 10.9 FT, .612 TS

So Durant has proven he can do just as much as Harden in a limited time, and im sure he could probably do it over a full season. Harden is likely more durable but thats purely guesswork. It's a good conversation because I think these two are clearly the two best scorers of their generation while doing it in very different ways with different styles."
4441,2020-08-19 02:49:41,ice6hv,The difference is KD avoided that greenlight by going to the Warriors. It was literally his choice
4442,2020-08-19 03:22:54,ice6hv,"KD said he does not want to take inefficient shots. He likes to keep his percentages high. He prefers to spot up and shoot. He said he went to GS because he thought the game would be so much easier for him. He could just run the floor and get open looks from all the attention Steph and Klay generated. Does that sound like a guy who wants to lead a team's offense? Unlike Harden, KD does not relish being the sole option."
4443,2020-08-19 05:22:57,ice6hv,You think I’m arguing with people who’ve never seen the man play?
4444,2020-08-19 03:21:17,ice6hv,One on one I would go with who played against the person but you do you with the numbers man have at it we all know y'all want this to turn into baseball anyways.
4445,2020-08-19 07:21:51,ice6hv,oh well then harden better one on one player then debate settled
4446,2020-08-19 03:45:25,ice6hv,I defer to you the expert
4447,2020-08-19 03:25:35,ice6hv,"Yes, I think that's exactly what he was talking about. If he was talking about ISO scorer he would say ISO scorer, he knows the difference."
4448,2020-08-19 04:01:47,ice6hv,"If I had read 1 on 1 *on offense*, I would have agreed with you.

But with just plain 1 on 1, I have to include both ways. Harden's strong in the post, especially against bigger men, and that step back and being lefty helps. But you don't even have to break down the analysis to more minute levels when you realize the game is played two ways. 

Heck, even with ISO, there's normally someone who's the primary defender."
4449,2020-08-19 02:20:29,ice6hv,"ISO isn’t the same as 1 on 1, there’s no 1 on 1 in the nba lol"
4450,2020-08-19 03:07:00,ice6hv,Nope. Incorrect. He gets posted up by bigs. He's our goto post defender in crunch time.
4451,2020-08-19 03:07:56,ice6hv,Commenting from 2013 are we? Lmao
4452,2020-08-19 01:48:21,ice6hv,Not as good as Spurs Kawhi but he's still at an all-nba level when he locks in. If Harden can win a title this year I'd put him over and would be the bests player in the league.
4453,2020-08-19 01:55:43,ice6hv,"Still good tho, and way better than harden"
4454,2020-08-20 02:12:41,ice6hv,1 on 1... why are you talking about off ball?
4455,2020-08-19 02:26:58,ice6hv,His opinion on players he aint never played with might be shit but he knew exactly how good a player was he took on the floor.  Don't get it fucked up.
4456,2020-08-19 02:23:44,ice6hv,"thats fair i guess i just trust mj cuz hes the goat

i think itd be an extremely interesting hypothetical 1v1 and can see it going either way tbh."
4457,2020-08-19 02:45:27,ice6hv,"Lmao. Give Kobe the spacing of modern day, specifically The Rockets team and watch what happens. Better yet, have kobe and harden play 1v1. Kobe crushes him."

Isolating it to just Harden, I don’t see any place where it would hurt him to add that shot to his game. I really think it would help him in the playoffs."
4461,2020-08-19 03:16:32,ice6hv,"We are talking about a 1 on 1 matchup, not a standard basketball scheme. Hardens efficiency in a clear-out situation where the defender is trying to funnel a drive to the weak side while worrying about screens and ticky tack bullshit calls ain't part of the equation."

4468,2020-08-19 15:17:26,ice6hv,"You know who also holds all of those accolades (multiple-time scoring champ, mvp, and went to finals)?

James Harden."
4469,2020-08-19 03:13:31,ice6hv,"Harden is absolutely insane. I am not trying to discredit him at all. Dude is a beast. I drafted him 1st in fantasy last year, lol.

But you summed it up best. Efficiency and Playmaking. Biggest difference between these two players, and in the end they are kinda the same beast. 

Completely forgot about the Russ injury, that is pretty much the exact example I was looking for. 

Great post."
4470,2020-08-19 02:53:39,ice6hv,"What? 

He would of still been playing with Russ if he stayed with Thunder, who is the farthest thing from a pass first PG. What other situation would of given him the green light that Harden had? Zero. He was going to a contender no matter what. No team KD went to would of allowed him to shoot 24.5 shots a game.

Do y’all honestly think if you swap out KD for Harden he wouldn’t of averaged 36 points?"
4471,2020-08-19 05:35:07,ice6hv,Yeah you tool you're the only one who's ever seen Kobe play
4472,2020-08-19 03:24:06,ice6hv,"That's kinda silly considering the greats who played against Kobe in his prime and give him the top spot haven't played Harden the past 3 years.

Also, Chuck DID play against MJ and Kobe lol. You can't just discredit what I'm saying because it's in Hardens favor. If the stats had a clear case for Kobe you'd be defending the numbers.

And for the record I hate baseball and have never watched more than 2 innings in one sitting."
4473,2020-08-19 16:37:05,ice6hv,And we should defer to your dumbass takes?
4474,2020-08-19 03:29:28,ice6hv,"You can't have actually watched that clip and think he was talking about a pickup 1on1 style game. He even starts out talking about how different teams imitate the Rockets but can't because they don't have a 1on1 player like Harden. Isolation IS 1on1 lol, it's interchangeable.

Why in the world would he bring up a literal 1v1 game?"
4475,2020-08-19 04:03:10,ice6hv,"Read what? Did you not watch the video. The context isn't about literal 1v1, because why would it be? That shit doesn't matter.

Apparently a lot of you think he was talking about actual 1v1 though which is hilarious. And in games people don't talk about the best 1on1 player including their defense. It's always an offensive discussion for iso players."
4476,2020-08-19 02:24:25,ice6hv,Watch the video. He is talking about in game situations.
4477,2020-08-19 03:29:02,ice6hv,"Tucker and Cov pick up the bigs, stop lyin. Rox whole game is based on giving up rolls to the basket and out-bombing them, you never seen a D'Antoni defense before?"
4478,2020-08-20 03:01:00,ice6hv,"> Harden plays a lot more 1 on 1 style of Basketball than Kobe and MJ. Both MJ and Kobe a lot of the times played within the offense by cutting, moving without the ball and coming off picks.

Because I’m responding to your response to this?

How fucking high are you right now?"
4479,2020-08-19 02:41:48,ice6hv,"Those players didn’t play against prime harden, so their opinion is irrelevant on him also by your logic"
4480,2020-08-19 02:25:20,ice6hv,Barkley played against a better version of Kobe so I respect his opinion.
4481,2020-08-19 09:45:20,ice6hv,"So the highest percentage midrange shooters are just as efficient as a poor 3pt shooter , got you"
4482,2020-08-19 16:52:32,ice6hv,Yes an open mid range might be better than a contested 3. But my point is in the current Rockers system Harden is literally never even in a position to take open mid range shots so there's no point in learning them. You don't get open mid range shots on an iso unless the center is helping but that means an open 3 on the kickout.
4483,2020-08-19 03:02:37,ice6hv,But if you're either doing a step back 3 or driving all the way to the rim/kicking out to a shooter you're just never going to be in a position to even take a mid range.
4484,2020-08-19 02:38:07,ice6hv,"Wait, are you saying Harden needs to add a midrange jumper to his game? This is a serious question and not meant to be rude - how long have you watched Harden play?"
4485,2020-08-19 04:08:48,ice6hv,"Harden is just as good in a 1 on 1 with no ticky tack calls. He already barely uses screens and wouldn't have to worry about double teams and help defense.

And he'd still play from the 3 point line and either shoot or step back 3 or drive if he has the lane. He's not gonna need to shoot mid range shots at all."
4486,2020-08-19 01:45:17,ice6hv,Shot 38% vs him in the playoffs?  Wow honestly thought it was more like 20%
4487,2020-08-20 00:01:49,ice6hv,"I think KD is pretty handily the best 1v1 player of all time. Maybe someone like shaq could beat him but that's not really fair lol

Would probably come down to if MJ can get in KD's head which judging off twitter, he probably could lol"
4488,2020-08-19 09:59:13,ice6hv,"Please, ive sufferd enough.

I swear when i saw draymon fall pray to Lebron's little game and get suspended, i legit wanted him benched for life. He knew how curry was out for months on back on injuries that season and still did something sooo fucking stupid to jeopardize the chip.

That legit would have been GOAT season and it was thrown all away. Atleast he takes the blame for it so he tries to be better, which he has been much better incomparrison to before, but damn, that was a big loss."
4489,2020-08-19 02:59:56,ice6hv,"Again, I don’t care if he could — he did not and those are the facts. We don’t know if his body can handle the same load as Harden/Lebron/etc"
4490,2020-08-19 08:00:30,ice6hv,"I think his point is that if you actually DID watch Kobe play, this shit shouldn't even be a question.

I'm not sure about anything else, But I agree with him on that. No way in Hell is Harden better than Kobe in a 1 on 1... It's not even a discussion.

Handles: Kobe

Finesse: Kobe

Game on the line ISO play: Kobe

1 on 1 no one else on the court: Kobe

Cross up and drive to the rim: Kobe

It's just not even a debate. I'll give harden #1 player of all time in ability to draw contact/foul... Because of that, multiple players just decide to leave him alone on the drive or even when he shoots and give him a lot of space. That is what makes him incredible. However, pin a Prime Kobe on a Prime Harden and Kobe is smoking Harden 1 on 1 no question."
4491,2020-08-19 03:46:18,ice6hv,"When the greats of Harden era give him that kind of love then I’ll listen

And MJ said kob the only dude might beat him one on one that facts"
4492,2020-08-19 16:41:32,ice6hv,yeah boss saying Kob better one on one is outta pocket
4493,2020-08-19 03:31:49,ice6hv,"My bad, Chuck is saying that.

Also he's clearly faded and the three other guys rightfully take him to task, lol."

Laughing is better than pissed/spoiling for a fight etc. So no problem.

And iso isn't the same as 1 on 1.

Ciao."
4495,2020-08-19 02:26:29,ice6hv,Right but in here we are talkin 1 on 1
4496,2020-08-19 04:26:17,ice6hv,"Hey man, you honestly don't know what you're talking about. In any sense. That's not the play style of the team. The team switches to stop the roll man and cut off that pass and teams frequently target Harden in the post, (before people come in and say that his post stats don't matter, look up how often he's posted up on. The sheer volume coaches attack him is what proves the stats are not misleading.) Also Kobe was too smart of a player to beat Harden physically. He wouldn't post him up, he'd work him with finesse.

I'll give you some props on T-Mac though. In Orlando, he was a machine. The true KD prototype."

He’s blowing by people and hitting that step back but there’s always a human element to the game. Sometimes, you have to take that shot cause it’s the only shot. I agree with you though, the rockets have leaned all the way into their play style and I respect that so the opportunities are limited to pull that shot."
4504,2020-08-19 04:01:33,ice6hv,"I’ve been watching him since before his beard stood out lol. 

Add in the literal sense isn’t the right word there. More of a take it. As stated, sometimes you have to damn the analytics and take the middy. It’s part of the reason why I think them with a healthy CP3 were able to take the Curry KD-Warriors to the limit. CP3s willingness and ability to get in there and take that shot. 

I understand the rockets have committed to this offense they have and it’s working. I’m curious to see how the various teams adjust to it going forward."
4505,2020-08-21 02:56:24,ice6hv,Injuries is one of the reasons curry will never be on lebrons level. Absolutely insane how durable lebron is. Its unfair to compare someone like Stephon curry to lebron tho lol. Even if Dray is healthy Kyrie and Lebron fucking wouldve sealed it lol
4506,2020-08-19 03:19:45,ice6hv,Harden is so durable it’s crazy. He deff has that advantage on KD.
4507,2020-08-19 10:58:51,ice6hv,"Harden has better handles and is much better at getting to the rim lol. Kobe’s “clutchness” is probably the most overrated thing in the league lol, his stats in the clutch aren’t even that great. Harden is a better 1v1 offensive threat. Kobe’s still the better player."

And Harden era great will matter all of a sudden? Do you just tally up how many former players say something and go ""well, 20 former players go with Kobe and 18go with Harden, guess I know who's better even though most of these players didn't play against both of those guys"". You're literally saying you don't even have your own opinion.

I truly don't get why some people can't just admit they're wrong and instead just sound dumber in each response."

Almost no one shoots these midrange shots anymore because it's just not worth it, teams bascially invite the midrange when defending pick and role because its so much less efficient.

You've been told why they aren't. If you watched a game, you'd see iso can result in passes,, threat of double teams breaking up an iso , threat of that 2nd line of defense (eg at the rim) once you have your man beat and so on.

And that teams don't have to worry about who's defending on iso. With an iso play, what the rest of the team does can make a difference.

Anyone listening to you would think that iso in a game came from someone putting a glass cage on portions of the court so that they stayed the same.

Let's skip the pointless discussion."

I was replying to you talking about delusion because it was a dumb statement and no matter what I say you just ignore and go back to ""haha nerd only all time greats opinions matter"" as if that statement actually means anything.

You don't sound dumb because you think Kobe is better at iso, you sound dumb because you have no logical argument as to why."
4531,2020-08-19 13:53:02,ice6hv,Except there are literally stats available to put things into perspective when it comes to isolation within games and Harden is at the top of it when it comes to efficiency and that’s not even factoring in assists that come from isolation. This is what Barkley is basically saying without using stats. Don’t understand how this has turned into a hypothetical “who would win 1vs1” argument when that’s never what it was about.
4532,2020-08-19 16:54:41,ice6hv,"The numbers don't mean shit, but the fact that everybody agrees that your opinions are trash does.

Also no idea what that cage part is about. Just kinda threw that in there.

You're also wrong, 1v1 and iso are used interchangeably all the time because *some* people understand what you mean given the context. You don't seem to be one of those people."

4536,2020-08-19 12:30:33,ice6hv,"Donicic and Harden shoot no mid range shots whatsoever, the rest take  them rarely but this does not mean they are an eficient shots or why they are great players.

ISO = 1v1 and is generally talking about the offensive side of the ball. No one is ever talking about defense when talking about either one of those unless their talking specifically about who is the best 1v1 defender in which they’ll specify defender

I am a huge fan of Peep Show and there’s a great bit of dialogue between the two main characters in an episode, when they talk about the fact that one of them is going to miss the christening of his son and therefore the mother of his child is going to spite him by naming their son Ian. They have a bit of a “Ian? Baby Ian? Eurgh” back and forth.

4590,2020-08-18 14:46:03,ic0f50,We are considering Genevieve and really surprised to see it in the top 30. It was #172 in 2018 according to social security. Ophelia was #373 and now it is #32? Those are some huge jumps.
4591,2020-08-18 15:06:18,ic0f50,"Crap. We were going to name our baby girl Mabel. But now that I see it's on this list, it's making me reconsider."
4592,2020-08-18 18:50:18,ic0f50,Hazel at number 8 would be a huge jump and Noah at 28 would be a big drop
4593,2020-08-18 14:49:38,ic0f50,"Wow, Sophia dropped considerably."
4594,2020-08-18 17:03:38,ic0f50,"It's wild seeing my name in the top 100, I'm in my early twenties and when I was a kid I only ever met one other person with my name."
4595,2020-08-18 14:34:28,ic0f50,Leona is beautiful. Great choice!
4596,2020-08-18 19:34:10,ic0f50,I love Leona! We had a boy but it was my top girl choice!
4597,2020-08-19 00:17:34,ic0f50,Leona was in our top 3 for baby due in December!
4598,2020-08-19 02:04:31,ic0f50,One of my three tiny people is a Leona! Beautiful name ❤️
4599,2020-08-19 03:29:24,ic0f50,"I was so happy not to see my baby’s name on the list, and it’s the top comment lol. Love your other picks too!"
4600,2020-08-18 17:40:08,ic0f50,"Same here, I was like Beau and Zo?? What?? 😂"
4601,2020-08-18 15:21:16,ic0f50,me too!
4602,2020-08-19 00:38:07,ic0f50,Yes! But also being wowed by some of the “sibsets” too! Arlo and Ruby? Yes please! Charles and Gemma? Swoon! James and Margot? Perfection!
4603,2020-08-18 19:17:04,ic0f50,"Agreed! We have a Mabel Susannah and people either love the name or make a comment on how “old” it is... Mabel definitely seems like a hit or miss name for people, where other similar names get generally more positive feedback."
4604,2020-08-18 17:25:11,ic0f50,Zoe and Zoey too
4605,2020-08-18 16:41:14,ic0f50,To me it is different like Eli and Elijah or Sandy and Sandra. It’s not just a slightly different spelling it’s a different name.
4606,2020-08-18 18:40:11,ic0f50,"Same here! We have a 9-month-old Felicity. But these kinds of lists don't really have anything to do with actual usage, they're just names that people who keep name lists like. Felicity was #354 on the SSA list in 2018 and doesn't show signs of skyrocketing. I did worry because it's around #100 in the UK, but name trends there don't necessarily track with here. At any rate, there's very little chance that a Felicity born around now would have another in her class or even her school. That's rare nowadays even for much more popular names because parents are naming their kids a much wider variety of names than when we were growing up."
4607,2020-08-18 17:22:27,ic0f50,"I didn’t actually catch that on this list. That makes 75% of my kids’ names on this list, lol."
4608,2020-08-18 17:21:18,ic0f50,"In 2018 Vivienne was 268 in US but Vivian was 96, so combined I would consider it solidly a top 100 name.

I’m using it too, though, so 🤷🏼‍♀️"
4609,2020-08-18 16:18:32,ic0f50,I feel the same about Fiona lol. But since this isn’t an official list maybe we’re still ok
4610,2020-08-21 11:46:38,ic0f50,I feel like everyone I know is naming their baby  Vivienne including celebrities. Tom & Gisele and Eric & Jessie Decker both have little girls with the name. It’s a beautiful name regardless of popularity!
4611,2020-08-18 14:57:12,ic0f50,"These are not actual baby name statistics and the demographics of baby name website users are very self-selected (and many of them are not naming a baby right now, anyway, and even the ones who are are only using one name on their favorites list and it may not be Ophelia), so take this with a big grain of salt. It doesn’t surprise me at all that a name like Ophelia is overrepresented here."
4612,2020-08-18 15:29:42,ic0f50,"This list won’t be the actual usage. It’s a prediction from one website, based on favorites and user-reported usage from only the sort of people who make accounts on baby name websites. Many of them are not actual expecting and naming a child, and many are favoriting many names but of course only using one."
4613,2020-08-18 19:12:52,ic0f50,"Chiming in because we just named our baby girl Mabel! Last I checked Mabel was in the 400s on the SSA list so like others have said, it seems this list is more a list of names people like as opposed to actually using for their kiddos. I hope this list doesn’t dissuade you from using the name, Mabel is such a sweet choice!"
4614,2020-08-18 15:28:05,ic0f50,"It didn’t actually though. This isn’t actual name usage data. It’s a prediction based on user favorites on only one website. Many of those users may not be expecting at all. These numbers won’t be accurate, but they may be predicting trends in the next few years."
4615,2020-08-19 04:09:17,ic0f50,Same. On this list my name is top 20 but in the most recent SSA list it was top 30. I never knew anyone with my name growing up and always wanted to have a more common name. Now that I’m older I’ve grown to love having an uncommon name. I guess now I’m finally getting my wish lol
4616,2020-08-20 14:24:26,ic0f50,"Hi, I’m Ivy and same. Lol"
4617,2020-08-18 14:41:31,ic0f50,Thank you! We didn't set out looking for a unique name and I'd almost rather it be trending to validate our choice lol but we love it so we are going with it!
4618,2020-08-18 19:47:45,ic0f50,You clearly have great taste! Are you comfortable sharing your son's name? :) We are already thinking about future kids...
4619,2020-08-19 03:07:51,ic0f50,Mabel Susannah is GORGEOUS. I can’t get my fiancé on board with Susannah :(
4620,2020-08-18 18:10:25,ic0f50,And adaline and adalyn
4621,2020-08-18 19:13:13,ic0f50,This is a great perspective! Thank you! I don’t even know what I’m having so I can’t stress too much lol. I’m not concerned about my boy choice bc it’s an ethnic family name that I’d never expect to even see in North America.
4622,2020-08-18 17:23:45,ic0f50,"I know it’s mostly projections but when you’ve latched onto a name, you start thinking about strange things like popularity."
4623,2020-08-20 14:20:10,ic0f50,Our daughter is Fiona as well but honestly you’re the first person I’ve seen use that name and one of only about 10 times I’ve even seen it mentioned on this page so I still feel like it’s fairly uncommon.
4624,2020-08-18 20:05:39,ic0f50,Thank you!
4625,2020-08-18 15:41:34,ic0f50,"Yeah, I know, I meant according to this prediction/estimate..."
4626,2020-08-19 04:22:47,ic0f50,"Yep, that's exactly how I feel about my name! I kinda wish it had stayed uncommon but I know that's silly 😅"
4627,2020-08-18 20:59:44,ic0f50,"Our son is Solomon Arnold. A daughter would have been Leona Yvonne. I actually love Solomon and Leona together. 

We are pretty confident that we are r/oneanddone but other names I like are:

4628,2020-08-18 17:40:58,ic0f50,I’m not criticizing. I’d prefer my children’s names were less popular too. But it is what it is. I still love their names and don’t regret my choices.
4629,2020-08-20 22:49:52,ic0f50,oh cool! we’re in love with it now. thank you

4631,2020-08-18 10:41:14,ibyjdn,"no I don't really think thats the right way of looking at it. See the main problem when celebrities give shitty opinions on topics they know nothing about is that they VERY OFTEN seem to very confident in their response. If a celebrity simply didn't answer or didn't post that picture of themselves in the MAGA hat with ""TRUMP 2020"" in their caption, no one would have a problem with them. Also, you can't forgive someone for having a terrible opinion simply because it isn't their specialty... If someone asked me a chemistry-related question, I could easily tell them ""I don't know"" and move, or, I could voice my completely uneducated opinion and be rightfully judged for that."

Regarding the LHO link, we haven't got any other reference to the Kennedy assassination. I doubt Treyarch will tread on old ground, but we might have some connection with him and MKUltra in-game.

I did not think of the connection between the ads and mind control either. I'll keep an eye for those in the last two tapes."
4654,2020-08-18 03:27:58,ibsdqj,"Thank you! If I had to guess possible levels indicated by this clip, beyond what I've already stated, the overrunning of the special forces team in Laos, the Algiers Putsch, and the Ole Miss riots seem to be the likeliest candidates. Also note that this counts as a mention of London/ the UK, before the reference in the 1968-69 tape. Considering there are several references to segregationists, especially the already thriller- movie- bad guy (literally, he was partly an inspiration for the villain in Seven Days in May) Gen. Walker, I would expect maybe a Golden Circle- esque segregationist secret society or a military coup attempt, or some combination thereof. You did good work on 72-73, so I'll dig into it and just see what I can add."

4656,2020-08-18 01:41:00,ibpfmi,"My top recommendation would be Kim Stanley Robinson, Aurora or the Nars Trilogy. Stephen Baxter writes some good hard sf. Larry Niven and JerrybPourelle wrote one of my favourite first contact books, The Mote in God’s Eye. That takes place mostly in Space. Maybe some Robert Charles Wilson stuff too. There’s also the Sector General series by James White. That’s medical sf. Sorry, none of these authors are new."
4657,2020-08-17 23:31:53,ibpfmi,"Did I miss Dan Simmons on your list? His Hyperion Cantos graces a lot of lists. I honestly prefer Ilium and Olympos, but they’re all good reading. 

Maybe some Neal Stephenson? Snow Crash or Cryptonomicon are great to start with. I have Anathem on Audible and listen to it basically on repeat."
4658,2020-08-18 01:46:50,ibpfmi,"You could try Ken MacLeod, Robert Reed or Stephen Baxter. Haven't listened to any audio books specifically but they meet some of your other criteria"

**The Diamond Age**"
4660,2020-08-18 00:22:29,ibpfmi,The Wayfarers Series by Becky Chambers would be my recommendation. Really interesting 'Hopepunk' style sci-fi with great characters and world building! The audiobooks are very well read too!
4661,2020-08-18 02:16:28,ibpfmi,">Jack McDevitt - I liked him until I read too much, but I don't find future human civilizations just being exactly 90s middle America to be believable and all his Big Reveal moments are anti-climactic to the point of ""Why did I read this??""

Oof, I hear that. I've really enjoyed a few of his books and I've landed somewhere between enjoy and endure on many more. I generally like his big reveals but find too many of his books don't end on that reveal climax and instead suck all the joy out of that moment of weird space discovery with 2/3rds of the book being how do we hard SF survive being stuck on X space object.

&nbsp;

Anyways, more to the point, you didn't mention reading Walter Jon Williams, I'm a big fan of his work and if you can find some of those they are worth a shot. *Voice of the Whirlwind* is his most outer space SF with audiobooks that isn't MilSF."
4662,2020-08-19 04:45:26,ibpfmi,"Some thoughts:

Charles Sheffield — especially the sequence beginning with *Cold as Ice*. (I didn't like most of his other writing nearly as much as these, although I did like *Between the Strokes of Night*.)

Charles Stross — *Saturn's Children* is set in space and I thought it was better than *Accelerando.* 

Short stories might work well for audiobooks as well. I think Greg Egan is much better at shorts than at novels; he can put out his mathematician-on-acid idea and then be done before you notice that he can't write compelling human characters"

You may as well give the sequeals a try. I'm not sure what ""major flaws"" you are talking about but a reasonably possible hypothesis is that they can be explained away at the beginning of the next book, e.g. (spoiler of book 1) >!why omniscient sophons didn't alert ETO about the operation in the Panama Canal.!<"
4665,2020-08-19 17:58:03,ibpfmi,"Yes, you are well read!  
How about Nathan Lowell’s _Quarter Share_ and the sequels of his Solar Clipper series?  I found them to be gentle and overall optimistic, and a narrative that pulls me along while I’m working, especially cleaning. They’re sort of coming-of-age Horacio Alger set in space merchant marine."

The first scheduled airing of ""The Candy Snatchers"" was replaced by ""Heavenly Bodies"" (I think it was a rights issue.) Later that season, ""The Candy Snatchers"" was scheduled again and that time it ran. Which I was grateful for as it had been one of my long time ""wanna-sees"".


""Nothing Lasts Forever"" (another of my long-time ""wanna-sees"") ran on its first scheduled showing in 2015 but its second scheduled showing in May of 2015 was replaced by a showing of ""Brainstorm"". (This time I know it was a rights issue.)

""The Wonder World of K. Gordon Murray"" was scheduled and was replaced by ""The 5000 Fingers of Dr. T"" in December, 2010.

In 2009, ""Massacre At Central High"" (another of my wanna-sees) was replaced at zero hour with ""All Night Long (1962)"" (that one I'm still smarting over.)


""Zombiethon"" (a clip show of the goriest parts of various zombie movies) was scheduled but replaced by the much-less-graphic ""Zombies of Mora Tau."" (Word around the campfire is that Standards and Practices put the kai-bosh to that plan.)

This story is going to hurt ur brain

How do I even begin? So I'd been hanging out with a few people over Xbox their name being Mega, QuickStrike, and O (yes, O.) And they had been trying to get my girlfriend in their party for the past few months. You see, I genuinely wanted them to meet but after hanging out with them for roughly a year leading up until that point I'd grown to know and understand their character, and I 99% did not trust then alone with my GF. One day I decided to put that to the test by joining on her account and kinda just talking to them like I normally would and playing R6, (also sporadically asking questions like, ""do u guys want nudes orrr, "" and ""i like ur voice hehe."" Obviously trying to solicit them to say some sus shit, it didn't work and I have a lot of respect to them for that. After I was done I pretended like I was getting tired and was getting ready for bed and thats when they called my bluff, you see id been playing normally that entire time and Mega had realized it and called my shit out for it. Obviously they then questioned my girl voice (it was honestly pretty fucking convincing) and shut my goofy ass down. I don't think this would have been as big of a deal normally but you see, I came out as bisexual a few weeks before this entire ordeal. They then questioned if I even had a GF, if I liked them etc etc (honestly I kinda understand why they would react and perceive it like that) They haven't talked to me since and often compare me to James Charles (lmfao.) Now I completely understand their reaction to this, i would most likely done the same, but from a moral standpoint since you guys actually know the truth. Was I morally in the right? Or is catfishing in any scenario wrong? 

Just a few sidenotes: We're all between 14 - 15, I've never been sexually attracted to a single one of them, my intent for catfishing was strictly to see how they'd behave with my gf alone, and this whole thing happened two months ago.

TLDR: I catfished my three close friends to see how they'd act around my GF alone and it ended up resulting in the loss of friendship by miscommunication, and lack of trust.

Cause if you told your friends it was you after the catfishing they’d still be annoyed, and if you never told them you catfished them then they’d think your girlfriend would easily cheat on you and probably dislike her. It’s also insulting to your girlfriend too to pretend to be her and offer nudes."

4796,2020-09-06 12:08:10,in0mug,"As for all of these points, let's go:

1. Zaptie texted a minor - he knew that she was under 18 and a fan. She claimed to be 13/4 but was lying nevertheless he was 20/1 and so should have known better. That was a massive imbalance of power and inappropriate. Cancellation deserved. Many people have been cancelled for far less. Sexual impropriety with minor fans of any description is one of the most toxic things that can happen on YT because of the adoration fans apply to their idols (of any size). And someone being your friend shouldn't affect you calling them out on their crap.

2.  Tati accused James Charles of being a predator. People believed her because she was well-spoken and convincing and because James Charles fluffed his first response badly - it was a tearful mess in which he refuted nothing. So, he lost 3m subs in a day. Nothing to do with Alex. The beauty community and tea spill community is huge and has far more influence. Alex put up a video on it as many people did. He also put up an apology.

3. Slazo - Chey accused him of rape not Alex. He regrets doubling down but that was because Chey had convinced him Michael was a predator. Michael did admit to lots of quite rank things in his response - allegations which, if they had been made independently of the false claim, would have lead to a lot of backlash against him. He admitted to being a controlling and terrible boyfriend, to pressuring her and to send quite rank jokes. Not that any of that justifies the false accusation but it does justify feeling off about him. I happen to think he's matured and grown from that but others might disagree. Incidentally, the way this story is told perpetuates several rape tropes which must go. Here is what I have to say about that: https://twitter.com/smj389/status/1302226228217339904?s=20

4. As for Kavos' manager, it was two lines in a three hour podcast. And a lot of Kristen's troubles were of his own making again: https://twitter.com/StuartJones7/status/1302189517114404871?s=20 Stuart Jones manages upload agency which organised several sidemen events and the KSI UK Boxing. So he knows what he's talking about.

5. I have spoken about Perez Hilton elsewhere, but to recap - Charli called him a creep, Alex repeated that. And he is objectively a creep and doesn't care who knows it. He's a tabloid journalist with years of muckracking experience and $$$$ he neither cares for nor deserves Alex's apology or your sympathy. He likes tweets calling him a creep ffs.

6. iNaber - Deserves it's own list:



1. There are four eboys - there is no justification focusing on Alex to the exclusion of the others. That is a framing imposed by Kavos and Keem and repeated by Diesel Peaches and Leafy. None of them actually like or even actually support iNabber.

2. The Eboys was not Fraser's idea - it is a group channel it's not novel. He didn't make any of the videos, have any of the ideas for them or anything like that. The name such as it was had been in use for more than a year. Will was called NumberOneEBoy when he played in MC Mondays. It's the name of their pro clubs team etc. 

3. They formed the group because of lockdown / quarantine and because of the success of James' Nico Video. Fraser was asked to be in that video but flaked. He's also not that close with George or Will. 

4. He missed the messages they sent him to talk about the group - a fact that he acknowledges. He found out on stream and got sad but realised fairly quickly that he should have known first. That's why he stopped his stream and deleted his tweets.

5. Within days Fraser tweeted specifically that it was all calm, they were still friends and that it had been a misunderstanding. He specifically asked people to stop going on about it as it wasn't good for him or any of his friends. Keem and Kavos decided to ignore the words of a grown man and continue to use it to hit people they don't like. Kavos, in particular, resents how Alex is friends with UK YT while he's on the outside. He once said he was planning a podcast with Will and George but it fell through. I imagine that must sting.

6. Fraser and Alex are still very close friends - they hang out all the time both IRL and on stream. Alex plays football with him, goes drinking with him and watched the England game with him. He has featured heavily on Alex's twitch streams. So, he and Alex are very calm. 

In sum, this is all a twisted narrative."

Felix has apologised, without doubling down, ON HIS MAIN CHANNEL, then he decides to TAKE ACTION by DONATING TO CHARITY MONTHS AFTER THE INCIDIENT. 

Where's the bias? 

Not to mention, Alex has done this time and time again and you keep defending him time and time again; For what reason? 

Also, I'm pretty sure legitmate slander and action is worse than a few words. I know you're young so you don't have a very large brain capacity to understand that actions speak louder than words, and Felix saying the N Word (Despite it being bad) is not on the level of ruining somebody's life at a legal level."

ImAllexx was heavily pressured to apologise in the first place; He doesn't care about Slazo at all. You can keep being cynical and say Felix did it to avoid backlash but what else was he supposed to do? Just move on and ignore the situation entirely? The best he could do was make a good apology, which he did...?

When did Felix complain about immigrants? Let me guess, you don't know the context now do you? Or did you just read a headline?"

4815,2020-09-05 14:03:20,imzpqf,"Apart from body structures, the main reason why these music is different from the Western sound is that we think thinner, breathier sound expresses emotions better. (I'm Asian) That's why we tend to sing like that. Yes, it is easier to sing high notes in that thinner, breathier way but it's hard to master. 

For beginners, I have to say that DON'T TRY TO LEARN FROM COMPARING THEM. The two music styles require different techniques, though interchangeable. Some of the ""not-Western-at-all"" sound like [this(a Canton pop song)](https://youtu.be/IbPOSDqDp0M) (at 1:23) uses different techniques from the Western kind of powerful singing. This is not about registers. You have to have enough knowledge about the two different style and enough knowledge about singing to compare and learn from them. (You can still learn a lot by comparing them but I just have to warn you guys as it can be misleading)

Edit: Language may also affect people's style of singing. When I sing in Cantonese, it is harder to ""land"" the sound or make a ""thicker"" sound but when I'm singing in English, it is easier to make those sounds. Maybe that's something to do with the placement and tone when you speak the language.

Edit 2: The reason why body structures affect the sound is Asians have generally smaller sizes of resonating cavities than Western people. 

(sorry for my bad English)"

4817,2020-09-05 16:22:15,imzpqf,"Also I've noticed that Japanese singers sing more nasally than Western pop, sometimes to the point of faking childlikeness in comercial pop (think Perfume). But then again, nasality is used for resonance in rnb styles and it doesn't have this quality. Japanese has a more nasal intonation in general, which must help too."

4819,2020-09-05 16:29:42,imzpqf,"Super interesting post, thanks for sharing! Weirdly never thought about how the language in which a song is sung can influence singing placement.

One thing I'm wondering now about it how tonal languages like Cantonese and Mandarin work with a fixed melody. Is the melody built around each word's already existing pitch to make sure the right word comes across? Or is it executed in a bluesy pitch fashion where just note is bent just a bit? 

I only speak English so I don't know the magnitude of pitch changes for words in those languages but I'm now super curious how songs are written with tonal languages! Gotta go research that.

Loved this post, very nerdy and awesome :)"
4820,2020-09-06 00:58:18,imzpqf,"Hmmm very interesting observations. As someone who listens to both a lot of western rock and Korean ballads, I can see what you're trying to say.
That being said, I think you need to consider the genre and stylistic effects the singers' are going for. Someone like Park Hyo Shin's voice used to be much thicker actually, but as he trained more, his natural voice came out to something like you hear in Breath. The chorus of Breath (and most of Park's songs) seem to be in an intentionally ""breathy"" mix to give it that extra feeling of ease. He is personally my favorite singer.
Someone to compare would be maybe someone like Lim Jae Bum or Lee Juck.
Also think of people like Robert Plant and Steve Perry who had extremely thin vocals in their mix range.

Ps. I really like most of the Korean songs you referenced hahaha"
4821,2020-09-05 12:14:35,imzpqf,"Gotta have something to do with the anatomy. In general, Westerners -- historically taller and bigger -- will have more volume in their chest cavity and bigger larynx."
4822,2020-09-06 02:26:23,imzpqf,"So you mention 'western' music, yet only talk about American or English-language songs and artists. Do you see the problem here? You're generalising numerous nations without having any idea of what you're talking about."

4824,2020-09-06 11:11:16,imzpqf,"As a native Cantonese speaker, I find it easier to sing in head mix when singing in Mandarin than in Cantonese, because Cantonese does have some glottal sounds, whereas Mandarin is mostly based on lips and tongues (dunno if I'm describing this correctly, I don't study linguistics lol). I also notice that most native Cantonese speakers have deeper talking voices than Mandarin speakers because of the lowered larynx position. A big difference between Chinese (all dialects) and English, Italian, Japanese, etc. is that Chinese does not have voiced consonants, which is probably why it's more easily sung in a head-mix. However, I found diction to be more difficult in Cantonese singing (less so in Mandarin), because the vowel modification is more restricted :("

4827,2020-09-05 17:01:17,imzpqf,We don't bend anything. The pitch has to fit the tone of the word perfectly. That's why writing lyrics in these languages is hard. We also have something like a chart for writers to follow.

It made me confused to hear that because I’m all for removing toxicity from your life, but then if they’re anti forgiveness types of people, where does that fit in to being loving and kind to everyone? Why are they still friends with Abby? 

In reality it sounds more like they don’t like criticism, only yes men, because there’s a difference between someone saying JoJo acts like a five year old, and someone saying “hey what you did here was kind of mean, can you explain that?” And I’ve noticed they can tolerate the first, but not the second.

4856,2020-09-05 12:09:31,imyqcf,Jojo's proven to be very ignorant. She doesn't care
4857,2020-09-05 22:14:57,imyqcf,"I’m okay with Jojo and all the kids... it’s the adults on the show that should be held accountable (as we all are these days especially) for bad, bad behavior. I’ve previously stated I’ve watched the show multiple times but I always skip parts of S7 and cringe at other parts. I don’t see how anyone can watch it and think it’s okay for a child to be treated that way. I’m specifically referring to the treatment of Brynn in her interactions with Jess and Jill especially. It’s sad, hard to watch and upsetting. I realize DM was a reality show and some parts of the drama were manufactured. That being said,  you can tell the this little girl (Brynn) was being picked on. Ashlee should have stopped it and when Jess realized how the scenes would be received by viewers she changed her   tune. IMO not because it was wrong but because her daughter’s anti bullying platform
is directly contrary to her actions. Sorry for the long post but you guys are the only ones I can dish with about DM!!!😘"

4859,2020-09-05 15:37:32,imyqcf,"Lmao have you seen her mother? She was theeee absolute worst imo. She was the ultimate bully, a mean girl, and a giant hypocrite so your apple doesn’t fall far from the tree theory is absolutely right. Brynn didn’t lose her passion for dance because of Abby if we’re being honest it was because of the moms. I know it’s a reality tv show but there’s only so much editing they can do without the moms giving them material. As for Jojo I just think she never had a real good role model. Her mom was always thirsty and hell bent on making her daughter rich and famous at any cost. And she also seems to have this mentality where she doesn’t care about the drama surrounding a person as long as they’re nice to her and can help further her career or expand her fan base. It’s very “yeah they did something to you/others but they never did it to ME so I don’t care”. I’ve said before that the moms are giant enablers. Most of them couldn’t stand to hear that their daughters weren’t being nice at times. They couldn’t take the littlest critique which is why they’d attack other mothers like regans moms, the legendary choreographers who called their kids lazy, etc. They all had rose colored glasses on about their kids and that’s why their kids were never held accountable for their actions."

Coming so soon after a post where I saw more than one person call themselves a “Cathy stan” it’s just leaving a bad taste."
4861,2020-09-05 13:29:28,imyqcf,"Ok, so do you know what REALLY grinds my gears?

People thinking people on television must be perfect. At all times.

They are humans. Humans make mistakes. You need to judge them as a WHOLE.

Has JoJo done way more good than bad in the world? Yes.

You're blowing things way out of proportion and judging someone like a demon when they're just humans who make mistakes sometimes just like you do.

SMH"
4862,2020-09-05 21:00:02,imyqcf,Another thing - when Jojo couldn’t (literally could not) do the lyrical and they brought in little Sarah. Jess was like saying she wasn’t qualified to be on the ALDC or even a rec dance team. Meanwhile she won with the solo and Jojo placed 3rd. So rude of Jess! And how awful she was to Brynn. Whether it’s for ratings or not it’s still BS to bully a child like ??

4868,2020-09-10 10:57:44,imyqcf,"This. Can you even imagine if every mistake you made from ages 10-15 was nitpicked by the entire world? There are certainly things that are less forgivable than others... but I cringe even thinking that every single nieve or immature thing I did in those stressful developmental years would be documented and analyzed for years to come. 

Kids 10-15 are immature as it is, then you throw in the aspect of filming a reality show, and living an existence that literally no one can relate to at that age.... its just a recipe for disaster inside a pressure cooker. 

Also, those things shape you one way or another and the fact that Jojo took those experiences and used them to build a platform thats based on antibullying and inclusion, speaks to her character. She witnessed alot, im sure, and shes using that to make the world better, and i give her alot of credit for that. 

Im not even a Jojo stan or anything, I just have a ton of empathy for kids in that situation. I think what matters most is how you choose to grow from it."
4869,2020-09-05 14:31:44,imyqcf,"That too. She is incredibly hardworking and got everything she has from that, which I admire that it wasn’t handed to her in any way. However, yes. She tends to say “I was just a little girl from Nebraska and now I’m living my dream”, but then will say “Today’s music is not real music like back in the day but in the future I’m going to do that” in almost the same breath without realizing how often she kind of throws people under the bus. 

Kind of like when people compared her to Bhad Bhabie  and instead of saying not to compare them very publicly said “I agree, I AM the better role model.” Which, sure, but her unapologetic nature is going to come back at her hard one day. (I’m having flash backs to the “prank” for views about her dad getting hit by a bus years back)"
4870,2020-09-05 20:57:50,imyqcf,"Jill was worse IMO, Jess too. Ashlee said all kindsa stupid crap but not to the kids and never yelled at anyone’s kid. Can’t say the same for Jill and Jess though."

He had a similar task with a crematorium having decorative plaques being stolen, I believe he made counter threaded coach bolts with a dome head that had small irregular slits and a corresponding set of tools. Pretty sure he plated them too to match the different plaques the crematorium offered.

They trained spies who would infiltrate Nazi-occupied France and gather intel and support resistance movements.

Some of the gadgets they were supplied with:

-Buttons with hidden compartments containing compasses. When those were discovered by the Germans, they made improved versions where *the buttons themselves* were the compass. By balancing one magnetic button over the other, they swivelled and pointed north.

-Shaving brushes with hidden compartments. They also had the reverse threading to make them harder to discover.

-Shoelaces with metal wire cores. They could be used as garrotes to strangle, or as flexible saws.

Some cool stories from actual operatives interviewed:

One man was stationed in France and his cover was blown. While running from the Nazis, he was shot. Bleeding, and with search teams coming after him with dogs, he staggered into the middle of a field and lay down. He figured that the search teams would focus on the edges of the field, since it seemed obviously foolish to run right for the center of the field. It worked, and he evaded them and got medical treatment.

One woman's task was to smuggle radio equipment in her basket. While walking to her rendezvous point, she was stopped by german soldiers. When they asked her what was in the basket, she smiled, and without missing a beat, said *""I've got a radio transmitter, and I'm going to tell them all about what you naughty boys have been doing""* The germans laughed and sent her on her way"

4959,2020-09-05 11:17:00,ims7xd,Well...did the reverse threads idea work on the Germans or not?
4960,2020-09-05 13:40:17,ims7xd,Unless that German is a normal person and so tries both ways for everything because they don't necessarily remember which way is the right way due to being a normal person.

Wouldn't work on me. I never remember how to unscrew so I always try in which direction it gets loose."

5013,2020-09-05 10:11:46,ims7xd,I ruined a part on my motorcycle when I was trying to install new mirrors. The right side mirror is reverse-threaded onto the handlebar  and I didnt know that. It's so if you drop the bike it's designed to twist out without breaking. I kept screwing it the other way and stripped the threads out....No one ever told me that.
5014,2020-09-05 10:33:06,ims7xd,"Had a friend named Brian Smith, maybe twenty years ago. His family was from England. I once asked him jokingly, a name like Smith, was your father a spy or something, He said something along the lines of, Yes, kind of, my father was like the guy Q in the James Bond films. Read this article and checked the obituary on the wiki page, he had a son name Brian. Pretty cool."

5020,2020-09-05 12:29:48,ims7xd,it is very common for me to tighten something before I realize loosen is the other way.

5024,2020-09-05 20:04:33,ims7xd,German pistols have left hand threads on the end of the barrels for suppressors.
5025,2020-09-05 20:40:21,ims7xd,It's funny simply because growing up I was always taught to try and budge to the right first and then the left as a way of loosening the object you're trying to remove. Especially with the case of lug nuts on your wheels. Specifically more when dealing with things that may be harder to budge due to corrosion or built up gunk etc.

5037,2020-09-05 07:28:50,ims7xd,So they're just going to give up after trying and failing to unscrew it?  Seriously?
5038,2020-09-05 07:33:22,ims7xd,"What do you mean ""designed"" a left-hand thread. Like, NO ONE thought ""what if the threads went the other direction on a screw"" before?"

5041,2020-09-05 08:53:00,ims7xd,"This reminds me of the stupidity that is Italian thread bottom brackets.

On a bicycle the bottom bracket(the bit the pedals attach to) has a LH thread one side and a RH thread the other. This is so that when you’re pedalling one side doesn’t unscrew.

Clearly the Italian bicycle manufacturers are the same as the Germans as they stubbornly kept to two RH threads for their bicycles which meant extra maintenance as you had to tighten them periodically.

Now things have come full circle and bearded hipster idiots actively want this inferior design just so they can tell people that their bike has an Italian thread bottom bracket don’t yah know!"

Though honestly if there is something I'm unscrewing and I don't get it right away I just try the other way. My hands are already on it so it's not a lot of extra effort."
5056,2020-09-05 07:06:33,ims7xd,If I could I would give you gold for this. I feel like no one has ever read this book before. But it is one of the best books ever written on interstellar civilizations. I only wish Isaac  Arthur would do a special on his youtube channel.

Any mechanism that is likely to work itself loose over time with a right hand thread will be made using a left hand thread. One common example is the brush cutter (like a weed trimmer but with a circular saw instead of a string). It uses a left hand thread so that the blade won't spin off and decapitate you.

Usually there's some muscle memory involved, but if it doesn't budge, I assume I've got it wrong and try the other way. And then if that doesn't work I try the previous way again and hope for the best. If that still doesn't work I try to study to see why it's stuck or if it's something you need to pull instead.

I had no idea things were threaded mostly for right handers. It never occurred to me to think about it. 
I never realised people were incredibly confident of which way the thread was supposed to be turning. I just assume I've got things wrong.

5264,2020-09-05 07:38:15,ims7xd,"Using it for hidden spaces is pretty old too. A common competency demonstration for machinists is a trick bolt that unscrews to reveal a hidden compartment. You bore out the internal compartment on both pieces, and then the LH thread is cut so you can tighten it to end up with a hollow rod. Then the exterior is finished like any other bolt. Since these steps are done with the LH threads tightened it should appear seamless.

It requires chuck changes which tests the machinist's ability to fixture work and maintain concentricity (how uniformly round a part is over a given distance). Multiple boring operations, LH/RH threads of the male and female variety, indexing to cut the hex head, and a test of surface finish to top it off. There will be measurable deficiencies with an inexperienced operator. A qualified machinist can crank these out within a thou for tolerances."

D-day was successful in large part due to Operation Mincemeat, which outsmarted the Germans.

As for the forces involved, you’d be surprised at how seemingly little is needed.

As a specific example of the latter, most handguns are rifled with a right-hand twist. This also imparts a spin to the propellent gasses. If you use a right-hand thread to attach a firearm muffler to a handgun with right-hand twist rifling, that torque tends to encourage the muffler to work itself loose every 5-15 rounds. If you use a left-hand thread interface to attach the muffler, the slight torque from the propellant gasses tends to help keep the muffler firmly attached."

The valve has 3 seals one in the all the way down position that keeps the gas in the tank, one around the shaft of the valve to seal it as you turn it open and another that basically acts as a safety/leak protection that seals when the valve is fully open.

The shaft seal is not perfect so opening the valve until the ""rear seat"" is closed helps ensure no leaks."

Pedals on bicycles have to take a large torque (Perhaps 500k Nm with a strong rider jumping on the pedals), yet the design of a tapered keyway is 100% unsuitable.   That's why pedals falling off is a pretty common failure mode of bikes, and why they need a reverse thread to discourage slackening.

Instead the keyway should be parallel and the bolt should be through the side of the crankshaft, then then it could be any handedness and would never work itself loose."

In order to retain the customary clockwise-is-tighten and counterclockwise-is-countertighten that is familiar to the young people who will be the crew, the valves were reverse threaded."

For some things (I don't actually know anything about bikes specificaly), you can do stuff like attaching with multiple screws that aren't centered, so there's nothing turning about the axis of the screw,  but that only prevents unscrewing, it doesn't actively rescrew when random vibration messes it up, so you still need all the usual vibration resistance, plus making things big enough to fit all the screws.

Still, for mass production where you can do anything you want pretty much, as long as you sell a million, there's something to be said for eliminating unique parts.

I've never seen it done, but I suppose you could also have a flat headed screw, with a secondary screw hole at and angle, such that unscrewing it would put a pulling force on the secondary retaining screw, which would be off axis and not see the rotation.

My mom told me once that left and right to most people was like up and down!

I have never had trouble reading but always thought there was some wire crossed as in dyslexia. I am ambidextrous though. Testing when I was a child showed that one of the reasons I couldn’t catch well was that my brain had no automatic mode. Most people, you throw a ball at them and they reach out with right hand and figure out where to put it to catch the ball. Me? My mind would unconsciously be calculating trajectory and flight path and deciding which hand to try with and then the ball would hit me in face while I was deciding which hand to try to use. 

When I first learned to type and was good enough to not have to think about where the keys were, I would sometimes make errors where it was the right key position but with the wrong hand. So for example I might end up with a Q (left pinky top row all the way left) where there should be a P (right pinky top row all the way right). Or a mixup between C and N.

The only difficulty is knowing if you're supposed to face the centre or face out.

They pretty much don't fail. normally you snap the pedal axles just outboard of the inner bushing if you break anything on a modern mtb doing that. 

It's not that hard to put pedals in right, it's immediately obvious from a glance at the threads... 

Source: worked in that industry for a while."
5582,2020-09-05 06:31:16,ims7xd,"I’m surprised we haven’t seen any cranks and pedals built this way.   

You could use the spindle as the through bolt and potentially build insanely strong running gear.  The only problem in making pedals excessively strong is that you then transfer any excess load to the other parts.  

I’d much rather replace a pedal or two than cranks and bottom brackets.   

So maybe similar strength is on order, but then why bother changing the currently dumb but good enough method?"
5583,2020-09-05 07:22:38,ims7xd,Why would the keyway on the crank mean the left pedal wouldn't need to be reverse threaded?

Kinda hard to differentiate when Czech almost died as a language. According to a city guide in Prague the Habsburgs perpetuated ""You speak Czech with dogs, German with people"".

5719,2020-09-05 19:15:04,ims7xd,"Pretty sure that's on me for not describing it well. In case you didn't work it out, let me try better. Imagine you have a bolt partly threaded into a hole and want to either tighten it or loosen it. But it's sticking out far enough you can grab it. And when you do grab it, you have your thumb sticking out like you're hitchhiking, except it lays along the shaft of the bolt. 

There's two orientations that you can grab it, one where your thumb points towards the hole, and one where your thumb points away from the hole.

There's also two ways you could rotate your hand while holding the bolt. You might call it clockwise/counter clockwise, but we're trying to get away from those names. Imagine if instead of using your fingers to point in a direction, they point along the circumference of a circle. So you could either rotate your hand (and the bolt) in the direction your fingers are pointing, or in the direction your thumb is pointing.

If you rotate your hand in the direction your fingers point, the bolt will go in the direction your thumb is pointing, and vice versa. This only works for your right hand. Also this is why threads are called ""right handed"". There are left handed threads that go in the opposite direction.

The reason I like this is because ""lefty loosey righty tighty"" makes an assumption about the way you are looking at a bolt. If you have a bolt stuck into a wall, you think about the top going left or right. But what if you're on the other side of the wall? Now the top of the bolt going left will tighten it. What if you're laying on your back and reaching into an awkward position? Now you need to think about your body in relation to the bolt and which directions are up and down and left and right. What if you have some dumb car from the 90's and they tried to fit too much into too small an area, and it's 1 AM and you're tired and you just want to be finished. And you are lying on your back covered in grime and your arm is shoulder deep into the engine compartment and you can just barely feel the bolt with the tips of your fingers, you slip your socket over the head of the bolt and think to yourself ""ok. Lefty loosey righty tighty"". Ugh. I find it easier to put my hand next to the bolt with my thumb sticking out."
5720,2020-09-05 12:36:21,ims7xd,"With maps it’s easy because there’s usually a compass telling you which way is North. I’ve just never had it explained to me which part of a screw/lid we were to be measuring going left/right.

For example, air is a reverse-threaded CGA590 fitting. Nitrogen is a straight-threaded CGA580 fitting. These fittings are identical except for their nuts being threaded in the opposite direction. 

The CGA number should be stamped on the bottle's valve. The middle digit of the CGA number indicates whether it's a reverse thread or not... If it's an even number then the thread is lefty-loosey, and if it's odd than it's opposite from normal.

CGA fittings are also good with having a notch on the nut of the reverse threaded fittings"

I wrote ""mohpd"" after the second one indicating its pronunciation. It is the preterite tense of the verb mope.

On a basic non-RPN calculator, you'd type 8 / 2 + 10 = (mem store) (clear) 9 / 2 + (mem recall)

The key difference there is that you have to manually push and pull items from memory on the non-RPN calculator, and are often limited to just 1 memory slot. 

You could also have a fancier graphing calculator or similar that would support ""8/2+10+9/2"" and figure out the order of operations itself, but there are more complex situations where you end up with nested parentheses and it becomes messy. With a little planning ahead, RPN avoids that.

5853,2020-09-05 08:35:26,ims7xd,What exactly do you think clockwise is describing?
5854,2020-09-05 09:05:25,ims7xd,"Right so I’m staring at the top of a disc, however if you imagine that disc as a clock face that I was standing on, then depending on which number I’m standing on will alter the direction I move for a clockwise rotation.

12, which seems to be the expectation for most, does not seem objectively any better a position to stand than any other number which the phrase righty tightly offers no benefit with trying to remember.

The only linear direction that makes sense when thinking of an arbitrary rotation is the axis being rotated around, an imaginary line running through the length of the screw and directly to my eye in the hypothetical looking straight down case. However that is understood implicitly and still offers no insight as to which direction around that axis the rotation should take place.

Both left handed and right handed coordinate systems exist so even mathematically, neither direction is objectively identifiable, it all depends on the convention you choose to use.

I think it’s the very awareness that multiple conventions exist that hampers me since I then forget which particular convention happens to be used for this particular case."
5855,2020-09-05 12:22:41,ims7xd,"Indeed. Yep, but despite all the different directions, people generally manage to remember to turn the top of the wheel in the direction they want to go. Just remember the same for screws and bolts."
5856,2020-09-05 12:38:45,ims7xd,"But that's what I'm saying. If it's never been explained you should assume the top. Same with a map. Sure they are supposed to have a compass, but if they don't you should start with the assumption that the top is north. A compass is mostly useful for clarifying that the top is NOT north."

The point is that there is a relation between the words such that one is the capitalization of the other and has a different pronunciation. The fact that there is also a homograph of one of them doesn't change this. We do not need to have a consistent pronunciation across all homographs of each word for the relation to exist.

1. ""moped"" (verb) ⇒ ""Moped"" (noun) changes both capitalization and pronunciation

2. ""moped"" (noun) ⇒ ""Moped"" (noun) changes capitalization but not pronunciation

I think you're misunderstanding me. The uncapitalised noun ""moped"" never entered into the example I gave. The example was that the distinct noun ""Moped"", the capitalized constituent word of the trademark, and ""moped"", the verb, were capitalized and pronounced differently. That the verb and noun are unconnected isn't relevant.

Another example would a heteronym of a word used as a name. For example Rebel, as in the comedian Rebel Wilson, and rebel, as in the verb meaning to oppose. 

I explicitly stated that I would ignore these cases since the capitalization is trivial (you can capitalize any word you like if you give it as a personal name).

> The people can be pronounced both selt and kelt. 

Indeed but there is no fundamental, universal accent. All words can be pronounced in different ways by different speakers. Thus, you can only pick about one pronunciation at a time to talk about. I was referring to the pronunciation ""kelt"" for Celt, not ""selt"".

The same goes for rebel and rebel. Rebel Wilson's name inn't pronounced differently from the verb ""rebel"" becsuse it's a name/capitalized. It's because her name derives from the noun rebel, which was always pronounced differently from the verb.

However, 'America shot the bulb because it's black' is just like a 'hot take'. It's not structured like a joke. There is no setup or punchline. It's accurate, as such, but if accuracy is the only thing your 'joke' has, then it's...it's just a statement.

Why are you calling people idiots for offering their perspective? Would you rather people you don't agree with just shut up? What a wonderful world that would be, eh :P"

I hate to say this, and I hate to hear it, but I love dark humour...now, I appreciate it's very hard to trust people who say that, but bear with me.

But the America thing wasn't a joke. You can still find it funny, but it wasn't a well developed, interesting, or poignant joke.

The German/Polish one was a joke because it employed repetition and bait/switch and was also historically accurate! Trifecta! It was laid out like a joke, it was a joke, it happened. I happened to find it funny, others may not.

The English one was a further run on this, further relying on the historical context of WW2 to hit the same note, phrased in a similar way, and was all kind of tongue in cheek.

The America 'joke' was none of these things. It didn't follow the pattern, it was lazily phrased, there was no set up/puchline or any sort of formulaic element (which in humour is a somewhat necessary thing, as all comedy has a formula). It was a pure hot take delivered bluntly and smugly.

It also reeked a little bit, but I can't exactly elaborate on why. There was something masturbatory about it, like ""Take that, America! Yeah, I've been keeping up with the news, look at me! This is so relevant!"" and there was none of that in the other jokes.

If you really want, I can actually hit the books and get some sources to strengthen my argument, but if it wasn't already evident from my complete lack of a sense of humour: I know comedy. I study comedy. I'm not a funny man, but thankfully that's not a prerequisite. This is qualitatively lesser than the previous jokes, it's a bum note with a hanger on trying to say something cutting and 'relevant' but it...yeah, it got you and that's great, I'm glad you laughed, but it wasn't funny. I laughed at my duvet falling off the bed, it doesn't mean I'm gonna film it an put it on youtube."

It was lazily worded attack on a big, easy target, with no imagination or flair, and being delivered online there's no opportunity to even use cadence or anything to make it better. Like oh my god, did you know black people were oppressed in America?

You know when someone tells a joke about your field of expertise, and you laugh *harder* because holy shit, that joke is so technically well crafted! It relied on aspects of knowledge that you have, and you feel *satisfied* in your laughter because that joke had so many *elements* that made it work, and relied on the audience knowing x about y, etc.

This is the opposite, delivered lazily, with a certain smugness. If it had at least been a WW2 reference buried in there it might have had some saving grace, but like...dude. We all lack standards in some areas of our lives, but it's nothing to be proud of.

6148,2020-09-04 23:59:31,imldfs,"They could in theory but it would be very hard to run optimally like that. It would mean the drivers have to lift and coast often. 

Also I can imagine that the loss of engine life might not scale linearly with power increase, where qualifying modes might cause a lot of wear on an engine for only a moderate increase in power."
6149,2020-09-05 02:15:48,imldfs,"They talk about this around the 24:30 mark of the espn broadcast.  They said it could damage the car or engine due to the added stress, the cooling system you would need would ruin the aerodynamics of the car, and something Elise I couldn’t fully understand about exceeding the gas limits"
6150,2020-09-05 01:26:18,imldfs,I assume you mean run the ICE component at highest power... Probably cannot run it all race. I have never seen a really good discussion of the limitations of the ICE. Since Merc had the best quali mode is it fair to say their higher mode took the largest toll on engine life. If Merc quali lap equals 25 standard laps does that mean another team quali lap may equal 10 standard laps of engine life. Assuming teams are increasing the mode can they all step it higher at same increment. Is it possible at one team may be able to increase the standard mode more because they are currently not using it high anyway? There are so many unknowns. The big assumption is that everything is linear and that Merc will be comparatively stronger. If another scenario unfolds it could be interesting.
6151,2020-09-05 00:42:18,imldfs,I think his actual fastest time was deleted for exceeding track limits
6152,2020-09-05 03:44:57,imldfs,If the car in front of you has already done all the work of pushing the air out of the way you can go faster. That’s how I think of it anyway.
6153,2020-09-05 06:40:21,imldfs,The air behind a car remains disturbed or 'dirty' for some distance and any car driving within this column of dirty air will experience less drag and reach a higher top speed.  The tradeoff is a corresponding drop in efficiency so downforce is reduced.
6154,2020-09-05 00:25:00,imldfs,"Well Daniel had lap that was 1:20.8 which would’ve put him third, but his lap time was invalidated due to running 10 cm wide at Parabolica."
6155,2020-09-05 07:51:02,imldfs,"Renault were good at Monza last year and Spa last week, not quite 'never been good at speed dominant tracks'"
6156,2020-09-04 18:54:01,imldfs,"Ocon used an older engine for friday according to Abiteboul (French broadcast), and Ricciardo had a 1:20.905 lap time deleted in FP2 for running like 10cm too wide in Parabolica (which would put him in 3rd behind the mercs but in front of Verstappen).So there is still hope"

6159,2020-09-05 03:48:31,imldfs,RB praising Albon this year doesn't necessarily means they prefer Albon but rather that they learned from their mistakes that not protecting and bashing the second driver in the public doesn't help them in anyway and probably puts more pressure in the young drivers that makes them do more mistakes
6160,2020-09-04 19:52:38,imldfs,"This is more or less what i mean and don't get me wrong. For these debriefs in the last couple weeks i've spent most of my time following Albon's onboards. I don't want them to drop Albon at all. I think he's been improving, but just what you rightly point out. 

Albon is being praised for doing a similar job to Gasly. The only thing you can point at is the overtakes/ attempts Albon has done. Which to Albon's credit are still very impressive. But it feels so unfair for Gasly. 

One other point is that a couple weeks ago that interview with i think it was Rachel Brooks or Natalie Pinkham, at least with Sky. They didn't really ask Albon the tough questions, that i feel should've been asked and did get asked to Gasly last year."
6161,2020-09-04 21:03:00,imldfs,Relatively new F1 fan here- how is it that the ramifications of the Ferrari/FIA debacle was kept behind closed doors and away from the public? I can't think of another sport that would do such a thing.
6162,2020-09-04 22:17:53,imldfs,I swear the sheer number of FIA rules and regulations are meant to obscure and decrease transparency
6163,2020-09-05 03:06:31,imldfs,And he was also on hard tires for some reason.
6164,2020-09-05 03:20:36,imldfs,the amount of of times this has been repeated is mind-boggling im almost annoyed at him for causing this endless misunderstanding
6165,2020-09-04 19:03:17,imldfs,Engine mode is frozen between qualifying and the race so they are probably tinkering with the different modes to find one that suits both and will also probably run an older engine on a higher mode long run and then send it back to the factory to see the impact of that on the engine
6166,2020-09-05 03:42:10,imldfs,he had that in the 1st race of this season.
6167,2020-09-05 04:46:47,imldfs,"that makes sense though i'm still gutted for gasly's treatment before... but if RBR has really learned how to treat their 2nd driver right, then hopefully that means gasly's treatment is gonna be the last.."
6168,2020-09-04 23:23:08,imldfs,"Officially they say it's because it would take too long to prove that they definitely cheated.

But more likely it's because if the FIA were to come out and state that Ferrari cheated it would create a huge scandal. They are a very strong brand within F1 and therefore hold a lot of power over the FIA.

After all they get paid tens of millions a year just for showing up and get a veto over any rules that are  introduced. The whole relationship stinks of corruption."
6169,2020-09-05 02:32:01,imldfs,"Because it's FIArrari. And always has been. The fact that the current FIA president was at Ferrari for 15 years (as a general manager, CEO and advisor) has nothing to do with it."

6209,2020-09-05 04:38:19,imklox,"Kawhi is the best on-ball defender of this generation as well as being one of the most unstoppable scorers in the league. He can put up an efficient 30 points while stopping the other team’s best player on any given night. He’s led two separate teams to a championship, and did it without another superstar besides a well past his prime Tim Duncan. And he’s only halfway through his career so comparing his total accolades with someone who’s played 16 seasons isn’t really fair. If it’s just down to who was the better player in their prime, then Kawhi should definitely be top 5 all time at his position. Pippen and Erving weren’t even the best player on their championship teams. And KD has only been able to win rings with the most stacked roster in NBA history. If anything 5 is too low for Kawhi."

Yes, a better scorer while averaging less points per game in his career, and never averaging 20 PPG once. 

More clutch? Arguable. Chris Paul is also extremely clutch.

Better passer? Probably, but Chris Paul has also led the league is assists four times and so the difference is so little.

Chris Paul also has the higher peak. What he did in New Orleans was outstanding, and Steve never had as good a season."

6243,2020-09-04 20:25:12,imklox,I dont know about the peak stuff. Nash in 05-06 was amazing. He averaged 19/10.5 on 51/44/92 shootin. Leading his team to the best record in a stacked Pacific without their 2nd best player. Also Nash did things that to beyond the stat sheet more than CP. Nash really had the original Steph Curry gravity effect. His presence alone made his teammates so much better.

Advanced stats don’t tell the full story, but we can’t deny that Marion was a great complementary piece. Marion, not Nash lead the team in win shares. 

Chris Paul in 2007-08 lead the league in offensive win shares and total win shares, something Nash never did. Chris Paul had superior statistics to the league MVP (Kobe) and he was legit robbed. He won one less games than the Lakers with less help. 

David West and Tyson Chandler are great players, but hardly something to brag about, and that team won 56 games. 

He also played better than Nash did in the playoffs and his team lost in 7 in the second round and Nash lost in 5. 

All-NBA first team, first defence, leader in win shares, lead the league in steals and assists 

Definitely tops Nash."

6259,2020-09-04 18:05:32,imklox,Both of them don't have rings. Not Harden's fault he ran into the GOAT team and a way harder conference and AI was in an absolute joke of a conference in 2001.
6260,2020-09-04 20:48:04,imklox,"Marion was mainly an offensive threat because of Nash. 94% of his 3s were assisted and 74% of his 2s. Marion led the team in win shares because he was arguably the best defender in the league and on offense didn't have to do much besides layups/dunks Nash assisted on and shoot wide open 3s. 

Also that team was not stacked that year. It was Marion and Nash followed by a bunch of role players. They had 6 players play over 70 games that season Nash, Marion, Diaw, House, Raja, and Jones. Literally every one of those players averaged a career high in points that season just from playing alongside Nash. 

As you said advanced stats don't tell the whole story, but if you watched that team you would see just how dominant of a player Nash was to the point that he was the reason that team was able to stay afloat without Amare. In the 3 games Nash didn't play they lost by a combined 52 points.

Nash averaged 20 and 10 in those playoffs. And they made the WCF before losing to the eventual Champs.  so not sure what you are talking about."
6261,2020-09-04 20:50:30,imklox,"It’s important, it’s critical, but it’s not everything. 


There are plenty of guys who are exceptional defenders who ride the bench. 

Steph Curry has been a pretty awful defender most of his career. That doesn’t mean he hasn’t been one of the best players in the league.

With a point guard you could argue that vision and passing are more important, and Steve Nash averaged over 11 assists five times, I believe he averaged over 10 assists for 8 straight seasons"
6262,2020-09-04 22:21:25,imklox,"well that's not true at all...

like are you still under the impression that history looks unkindly on Nash's MVPs? because the entire fucking league tries to play like him now and in the stats we now know to be most important, Nash's MVPs look great. If anything, he deserved an MVP in 06-07 and didn't get one because all the whiners said he didn't deserve his previous two."
6263,2020-09-04 18:26:41,imklox,He's basically Jordan but if Jordan was much worse at everything
6264,2020-09-04 18:04:57,imklox,"It’s just not 2001, it’s the playoffs in general. Harden is a more skilled player overall, I’m just saying who I’d rather have on my team. It’s not about winning or losing, it’s about performing. LeBron lost to the Warriors every year but nobody says he choked because he played great. Harden, the “MVP” of the league shot 2/11 from three in the most important game of his life. His playoff resume is just not impressive at all."
6265,2020-09-04 18:07:34,imklox,"Lol apparently I can’t trust people on Reddit to understand my simple point. It’s not about winning or losing in the playoffs. It’s about performing. If I’m in a game 6 down 3-2 or in a game 7, I’d be delusional to prefer Harden in that situation. That’s literally all I’m saying."
6266,2020-09-04 18:08:00,imklox,Refer to my other replies.
6267,2020-09-04 20:50:16,imklox,"I did watch the team. 

He’s my favourite player, and anyone who has watched them both in their primes know Chris Paul was better, lol."
6268,2020-09-04 23:35:43,imklox,"Multiple times MVPs and how good they are relative to Nash

You’re calling Nash a multiple time MVP like he’s anywhere near those players

He’s not he he’s one of the worse MVPs as a matter of fact

And he didn’t derserve them imagine if someone gives Lonzo an MVP averaging 15/12 but at least Lonzo plays defense"
6269,2020-09-04 23:12:43,imklox,Kawhi is a better defender and arguably the better shooter.
6270,2020-09-04 18:27:41,imklox,"bro mad Kawhi is doing his thing, lol i get it💀😅

man don't wanna see this man get another title"
6271,2020-09-04 18:11:42,imklox,"I think you meant two right? Against gsw and sas, I can't remember third. I still wouldn't want AI over Harden but I get your point and everybody can have their opinions. Hope to see Heat in the finals."
6272,2020-09-04 18:09:20,imklox,"What else did AI do in the playoffs? Even in the 2001 playoffs which everyone jizzez over, he was inefficient as hell and was regularly outplayed by the opponents' best player."
6273,2020-09-05 02:20:17,imklox,"it's like you're just taking two separate years of when Kawhi won DPOY and now when he's one of the biggest offensive threats in the league and putting them together.

Kawhi is not playing DPOY defense this year like Jordan was in 86 while also being the scoring leader.

And you're right, Kawhi is better from outside the arc, that's it.

He's a worse finisher, worse mid range shooter, less athletic, not as quick, worse scorer, worse playmaker, worse defender (this year), and fuck it, he even has smaller hands while being taller."
6274,2020-09-04 19:41:49,imklox,This is like instagram levels of shitty commenting
6275,2020-09-04 18:10:19,imklox,"Sooo... just like Harden? No, not even. Harden is just plain worse in those situations no matter how you look at it."
6276,2020-09-05 04:17:04,imklox,"> it's like you're just taking two separate years of when Kawhi won DPOY and now when he's one of the biggest offensive threats in the league and putting them together.

Kawhi is still, statistically, the best wing defender in basketball.  Not DPOY level, but still the very best at his position.  His superior size and strength also makes him better suited against bigger assignments.

> And you're right, Kawhi is better from outside the arc, that's it.

He's also considerably better from the free-throw line, and emerging as one of the best mid-range shooters of all time."
6277,2020-09-04 18:11:45,imklox,"Harden has great efficiency, people just love chuckers for some reason. And at least Harden has more RS success, which puts him over since both don't have much playoff success."
6278,2020-09-05 04:22:03,imklox,">Kawhi is still, statistically, the best wing defender in basketball.  Not DPOY level, but still the very best at his position.

yes, right now. Jordan at his peak was a much much better offensive player than Kawhi's offensive peak while being nearly as good defensively at the same time. Like this whole thing is comparing Kawhi to Jordan, right? Not Kawhi to his peers.

He's not even that much of a better free throw shooter, if at all.

Jordan is a career 84 percent shooter, while Kawhi is 86. But, Jordan shot nearly double the attempts than Kawhi in his career.

Sure, he might be emerging as one of the best mid range shooters of all time. But Jordan is already the best along with Dirk. He won't get to their level due to the lack of volume."
6279,2020-09-05 04:40:12,imklox,"If your overall point is that Jordan was better than Kawhi, save your breath.  I never argued against that."
6280,2020-09-05 04:42:13,imklox,"I said ""Kawhi is Jordan if Jordan was worse at everything""

What could you possibly have thought I meant?"
6281,2020-09-05 04:44:20,imklox,"I thought you meant ""Kawhi is worse at everything than Jordan"", which isn't true.  He's overall worse due to upside, but you could actually argue Kawhi is just as well-rounded, and better in a few areas."

6383,2020-10-09 23:32:31,j88rxe,"I doubt it, there are plenty of dumb killers too, like Nik Cruz (look at the letters he writes to his fans, he writes like a kid), Martin Bryant (Port Arthur shooter who had a very low IQ), Salman Abedi (Manchester England bomber, failed at school), Devin Patrick Kelley (Sutherland Springs shooter, didn’t do well in school and committed a bunch of crimes)."
6384,2020-10-10 01:19:00,j88rxe,"I guess it’s only a coincidence. Although Charles Whitman had a huge IQ, he had brain tumour. While James Holmes was kind of like a genius, he had schizoaffective disorder, also Ted Kaczynski, according to some of the articles, was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia."
6385,2020-10-10 04:52:26,j88rxe,Nikolas Cruz killed more people then in columbine but has an astoundingly low iq
6386,2020-10-09 22:34:32,j88rxe,"Some of those people you mentioned may have had some academic success (James Holmes, Ted K) but they’re not representative enough of the entire population of mass murderers to indicate a link between mass murder and intelligence. No, mass murderers on the whole are not “more intelligent than the general population.”

Side note - who said Dylann Roof was of above average intelligence? Have they seen the interrogation video? Granted the fact that he was nervous played a role in his personality, but the guy was obviously not very intelligent. He had a number of learning disabilities to the point that “mentally retarded” isn’t actually that far off the mark, same with Cruz."
6387,2020-10-09 23:36:19,j88rxe,Why was this banned. I wasn't spreading misinformation I was asking a question.
6388,2020-10-09 22:45:20,j88rxe,i think so
6389,2020-10-10 01:05:49,j88rxe,I think higher intellectual people are more likely to be troubled than your average person. But theres not enough to say there is a clear link between mass killings and high IQ
6390,2020-10-10 00:07:39,j88rxe,Dylann roof was a literal retard lmao
6391,2020-10-10 01:43:29,j88rxe,"Yeah Ted Kaczynski's iq was 167 which was higher, if not the same as Albert Einstein's iq if I'm not mistaken."
6392,2020-10-10 05:09:26,j88rxe,Well low 90s isn't THAT low compared to some others.
6393,2020-10-09 22:40:23,j88rxe,His iq was tested at 125 which qualify's as above average. I've seen the interview and he does come across as dull but some people have trouble getting there ideas out there vocally.
6394,2020-10-10 00:33:03,j88rxe,That's incorrect his speech abilities were below average due to his autism but his iq was 125 which is comfortably above the average. Don't believe me look it up.
6395,2020-10-10 00:23:36,j88rxe,He really wasn’t at all. He was above average in terms of intelligence.
6396,2020-10-10 01:53:37,j88rxe,"He really was (still is?) a true genius, which is so sad that a person with such a rational thinking, real ability to change a world, or reach out to smth huge in science, was caught by a god damn schizophrenia."
6397,2020-10-09 22:52:39,j88rxe,IQ isn’t the only factor in intelligence.
6398,2020-10-10 00:33:43,j88rxe,Yes people here keep calling him dumb and retarded or whatever for not being able to speak in an organized matter since he has autism.
6399,2020-10-10 00:38:42,j88rxe,He literally dropped out of 9th grade and sounds like a retard in his confession and also tried to fire his lawyers for not being white
6400,2020-10-10 02:02:42,j88rxe,Yes the turning point in his life was when he went to his old forest he used to love but found it had all been chopped down by a lumber company. From that moment on he had a dep hatred for modern society and technology and believed humans were better off reverting back to a primitive lifestyle. If you read his manifesto that he had published in the Washington post you will se much of what he warned us about  modern technology has come true through the years.
6401,2020-10-09 23:34:54,j88rxe,"I know but it is still an important factor in the intelligence of a human being. When it comes to his speech, I agree that he is stunted there which has to do with the fact that he's autistic, but he's not stupid even if he has learning diabilities."
6402,2020-10-10 00:44:49,j88rxe,"Dropping out of school, “sounding like a retard” and trying to fire his lawyers have no bearing on his above-average intelligence.

Read his psychological and psychiatric reports, and it would prove it."
6403,2020-10-10 01:24:19,j88rxe,Its because he has autism and a learning disability which negatively affected his school life as he could not get his thoughts out the way he wanted to and it all came out in a mess or in a dull sounding way. His iq is above the average. That is a fact.
6404,2020-10-10 01:24:58,j88rxe,Thank you. Grades and speech don't solely represent a person's intelligence.
6405,2020-10-09 22:29:51,j88op3,I don’t think about this is the answer lmfao
6406,2020-10-10 03:59:46,j88op3,felix probably isn’t really in the loop
6407,2020-10-10 05:39:09,j88op3,"I think the same, not good timing"
6408,2020-10-09 21:04:32,j871y0,Nobody considers that a roast...
6409,2020-10-09 19:31:36,j85dcj,I think Sofia will address what happened ONCE and then move on from it for good (the mature thing to do) I think Alex however will retaliate and it will make her look even worse. I truly believe Alex is a pathological liar and she’s scared shirtless rn bc she KNOWS Sofia has the receipts and is trying to get her story straight before Sofia speaks
6410,2020-10-09 22:58:50,j85dcj,She is lowkey winning rn she's her own boss
6411,2020-10-09 23:20:10,j85dcj,Update - she did 😂
6412,2020-10-09 22:22:52,j85dcj,Lmao YES. I think she might
6413,2020-10-10 02:05:02,j85dcj,Alex is 100% a pathological liar and I know she’s gonna say some shit to make Sofia look bad which is why Sofia probably said “and no matter what you say after this to make me look like shit this is the last thing i’m saying about you”
6414,2020-10-09 19:33:05,j85dcj,I totally agree. That’s why I really hope Sofia has some real concrete evidence & receipts that Alex can’t even try to lie her way out of
6415,2020-10-09 22:49:37,j85dcj,"Dude u were right!! I just listened to her first ep and she was saying she would get this out once and then never mention it again, even if it meant letting the other side get the last word."
6416,2020-10-09 22:48:07,j85dcj,This was sooo good
6417,2020-10-09 18:56:45,j84xu3,I respect your opinion but i do disagree with most of what you said
6418,2020-10-09 19:00:34,j84xu3,I don’t get this...
6419,2020-10-09 19:06:06,j84xu3,"If you want constructive criticism, I am open to say it. For now I will just say that I think this could be better thought out"
6420,2020-10-09 23:40:35,j84xu3,"I disagree with everything here chief

Your opinion but nah"
6421,2020-10-09 19:08:14,j84xu3,"I don't think Green will do that well. James Charles and Connor will probably be bottom ten, Pete will pop off as usual, and Burren will get around 10th-25th. I just don't think Pete can carry this team much higher than 7th."
6422,2020-10-09 19:13:40,j84xu3,"note: these are first impression predictions, but i am open to any and all criticism, as long as it is constructive"
6423,2020-10-09 19:28:41,j84xu3,Orange last place? They’re at least above aqua and violet. Krtzyy can be top ten. Seapeekay is top 15 (with top ten potential). F1nn had a rough first MCC but I think he’s going to improve this time especially with Krtzyy and Seapeekay who like to practice. Mini can be pretty good with solid teammates which I think he has.
6424,2020-10-09 19:36:47,j84xu3,This is one of the weirdest ones for me.
6425,2020-10-10 00:09:17,j84xu3,Lime could win if parkour warrior is chosen in the first games (because multiplier is low). Parkour is the ultimate weakness of most hermits and they admitted it lol.
6426,2020-10-10 00:53:10,j84xu3,"just like everyone else in the comments, I disagree as well"
6427,2020-10-09 19:05:13,j84xu3,Same
6428,2020-10-09 19:13:44,j84byp,The reason for Tubbo's not great MCC 10 was because he was throwing for content.
6429,2020-10-09 18:37:18,j84byp,Whoa you spent a lot of time on this. I kinda want everyone to win tho :(
6430,2020-10-09 19:43:20,j84byp,"Well at least one thing is certain, if cyan does make it to dodgebolt, they don't have much competition given how good the TapLblade duo are with a bow"
6431,2020-10-09 19:58:25,j84byp,"this is tapl's fourth mcc, he got 12th place on cyan creepers, 20th on orange ocelots, and 5th on yellow yaks (:"
6432,2020-10-09 21:28:53,j84byp,"I can tell you put time and effort into making it easy to read, and you did your research! Whenever you said something about a player I like how you included your reasoning for it to clarify that you weren't just being biased. This, ladies and gents, is how you do a prediction"
6433,2020-10-09 19:49:07,j84byp,Technowin
6434,2020-10-09 21:40:14,j84byp,"These were also pretty much my predictions except I had violet and orange swapped. I personally think that while violet seems like a very content-driven team, it at least has somewhat of a foundation by having Fundy, Wilbur, and Tommy. Krtzyy is really good and Seapeekay is above average but I'm not sure that will be enough to carry F1NN and MiniMuka, especially since mini usually places bottom 30 and this is only F1NN's second event.  


idk I might just be biased towards the sleepy bois"
6435,2020-10-09 23:25:26,j84byp,"if it’s cyan and pink in dodgebolt, cyan is winning in my opinion"
6436,2020-10-10 01:15:44,j84byp,"You pretty much have the same prediction as me. I think almost every team has a chance to make it to dodgebolt, but the two clear front-runners are Cyan and Fuchsia."
6437,2020-10-09 18:47:10,j84byp,I think the results of last event's dodgebolt is going to push Scott and Shubble to do way better this time. Shubble especially seemed to really take the dodgebolt loss to heart and it will probably motivate them more than we think.
6438,2020-10-10 00:39:13,j84byp,"Sapnap didn't have an ""off"" tournament, he just came back to the range of his usual performances. His placements was 8th, 10th, 3rd, and 14th. He just particularly popped off in MCC9."
6439,2020-10-16 00:53:04,j84byp,Yeah it will be really sad if the dream team+ karl will never make it to dodgebolt. I really want karl to win his first mcc when he is playing his first time.
6440,2020-10-10 00:46:42,j84byp,that's fair but his score in MCC 10 was around 700 coins less than his average.

6495,2020-10-11 02:51:46,j7th5n,"What about Jeff Dhamer or BTK? BTK killed over like the span of 30 years with large gaps in between, with semen being the only thing linking him to most of the crimes after finally being caught in 2004, his first killing being in 1974 or 1975, he also was able to give extreme details of each murder not know to the public just as other killers have done, I think people were actually just psychos because there are actually still murders being committed and usually they aren’t caught because police don’t really care about real crime anymore. So many bodies and body parts are found it just goes uninvestigated"

6503,2020-10-09 05:16:28,j7sd0i,"Phil Jackson - I used to be with you on Phil Jackson but I’ve changed my mind on him. A few reasons why. 

Yes he had amazingly talented teams, especially at the Bulls. He also managed those superstars very well. That’s no small task. Part of it was his off the court presence to manage multiple superstar egos. That’s not an Xs and Os skill but is a major part of coaching in the NBA. 

Speaking of Xs and Os, his use of the triangle offense was perfect for his superstar teams. It gets the full team involved. Yes Jordan put the team on his shoulders sometimes but that’s because the full team was engaged in their triangle offense. 

Threepeats  the last three teams to three peat were all coached by Jackson. Sustaining excellence is not easy and Jackson did it 3 times. Yes he had talented teams but the Bulls were also going against maybe one of the best teams to never win a title in the Stockton and Malone Jazz. Yes Jordan was the GOAT but Stockton and Malone are all time greats that played together and were much better than anyone else on the Bulls. The triangle offense Jackson allowed Jordan and his teammates to do something really special."
6504,2020-10-09 04:50:59,j7sd0i,"A large part of coaching/managing a team is to manage the egos, especially when you have many star players on the same teams as you've referenced. I think that's one of the hallmarks that separates mediocre and great coaches, more so than the X's and O's of whichever sport."

6506,2020-10-09 06:27:06,j7sd0i,"Michael Jordan, Kareem, Kobe, Shaq, all overrated. They were carried by good coaching, schemes, and supporting casts. They’d be nothing without Phil Jackson and Pay Riley. They’d all be Charles Barkleys."
6507,2020-10-09 06:35:47,j7sd0i,"Kyrie said recently that it doesn't matter who his teams coach is, and he thinks the earth is flat."
6508,2020-10-11 07:47:52,j7sd0i,"Phil Jackson is a master motivator. Both Kobe and MJ have said so. They said that his advice helped him in the mental aspects of the game. If they both say so, who are you to disagree? Having great players may mean you win a lot, but it doesn't make you a great coach, especially if you can't get your talent to play, a la Johnny Davis and Iverson or Doc Rivers and Rondo."
6509,2020-10-09 13:42:11,j7sd0i,"I agree with you on nearly everything ... except the 96 World Series

I think that series was emblematic of decisions that couldn't have been made with spreadsheets and sabermetrics, nor could have been made by a random fan putting superstars in the lineup and letting them do what they do.  

Torre sat a slumping Wade Boggs in favor of Charlie Hayes.  Not to insult the guy, he wasn't a horrible player or anything, but would anyone even remember Charlie Hayes's career if he didn't catch the final out?  

Played an injured Paul ONeil (strained hamstring if I recall correctly?)

Handling the 1B situation in the DH-less games.  Remember he had Cecil Fielder and Tino Martinez.  Tough call as to who to go to.  I'd be interested to find out if the sabermetrics would have suggested a different call in that situation."
6510,2020-10-09 16:53:59,j7sd0i,"The NBA is a player’s league, so the most important coaching attribute there is, is to get players to buy in. 

Other than that, I don’t know how to really argue against your assertion because it’s so subjective. Who knows if the lakers should have won 3/4/5 titles under riley. It’s tough to parse all that out in basketball."
6511,2020-10-09 18:50:23,j7sd0i,"So you could literally make this argument against any coach that was the head of a “dynasty”.  You’re not having a dynasty without a great roster.  With that being said, have you ever coached or played athletics at a high level? I don’t ask these things to be demeaning, I ask because it completely changes your perspective on things.  I grew up a coaches kid and a gym rat.  I cannot watch certain sports the same as any other casual viewer.

Joe Schmo wouldn’t be able to just put superstars out there and win games."
6512,2020-10-09 19:58:14,j7sd0i,"There are some coaches who are really good at making mediocre teams great, and there are some coaches who are really good at making bad teams decent. Then there are coaches whose skillset lies in making great teams into dynasties. It's a rare coach who can do more than one of those. 

I don't know too much about basketball, but I can talk baseball. For the first example, the manager who gets a team over the hump from playoff team to WS winner, look at Tony LaRussa or Terry Francona. These guys are, essentially, hot-shotters, guys who will lay off players during the regular season but get the most out of them in a short series. For the second type, it's Dusty Baker, a guy who frequently made rebuilding teams better than they were by being a teacher type. And then there's Joe Torre, a real laid-back guy who lets players do as they please. 

So what you need is the right manager for the right situation. If, say, the Yankees had kept Buck Showalter, who was more in the LaRussa mold, they probably would have won in 1999 and 2000, but in 1998 when they were down 2-1 in the ALCS, that's where a guy like that can have the team too on edge. Or when they were down 2-0 in the 1996 World Series. A guy like Baker would have just caused tension in the locker room, where you'd have guys like Bernie Williams and Andy Pettite who probably wouldn't have put up with him."
6513,2020-10-11 07:48:44,j7sd0i,"If Jordan hadn't been forced to retire, the Bulls would have won 8 in a row, possibly 9."
6514,2020-10-11 07:48:55,j7sd0i,"If Jordan hadn't been forced to retire, the Bulls would have won 8 in a row, possibly 9."
6515,2020-10-09 05:35:22,j7sd0i,"I know the triangle offense was designed to maximize the talent, you're right on that. I'll have to really consider this one for a few. He did top Malone and Stockton, and I hadn't really thought about that, although I remember watching. 

I don't know, I'm really hung up on the three of them never elevating medium-talent teams, but Jackson never had the chance until he was the Knicks team president. While his personnel decisions were terrible, he wasn't coaching, so his philosophies weren't tested out. 

I don't know, I'm really mulling this one over, especially based on the Stockton and Malone argument. Tomjanovich won back to back with the Rockets, defeating a couple of great times of the times in the Magic and the Knicks, but he isn't considered a great. Granted, though, he didn't demonstrate the sustained success.

I'm considering this one for a delta right now. Give me some time to think it over. I work night shift, so all I have is time tonight.

Thought about it, and I'll give you a delta for Phil Jackson, although I still consider him to be somewhat overrated.

Δ"
6516,2020-10-09 05:03:49,j7sd0i,"I agree with that, and I did consider that as a counter-argument. But when the teams experienced adversity, none of the coaches could manage the personalities very effectively, IMO. Everyone gets along when they're winning, but when times got hard or difficult, I don't think these coaches were up to the task.

When Jordan went and played baseball, Phil Jackson couldn't get Scottie Pippen to go into the game in the playoffs because Pippen was mad he wasn't getting the last shot. When he was with the Lakers, Kobe got him forced out, and he couldn't manage to find a balance between Kobe and Shaq.

Joe Torre could never seem to get the most out of Alex Rodriguez, and he never found success outside of that all-star cast, regardless of how well he balanced the personalities.

Pat Riley couldn't win without superstars, and sometimes even with stars. While he never faced a lot of locker room strife, he was not successful in elevating mid-tier talent to improve itself.

You can't understand how much it pains me to say this, as a New York sports fan, but Bill Belichick managed to make great careers for a lot of mediocre players. He got Ryan Mallett, Jacoby Brissett, Matt Cassell and Jimmy Garoppolo to be regarded as solid backups, and only Garopollo has found anything approaching success elsewhere. His receivers tend to be the same story. 

None of these coaches got more out of their players than their abilities would necessarily allow. Torre was so notoriously hard on his pitching staff, running them into the ground by riding the hot hand, that they had to put special rules in place when younger talent came up, like Joba Chamberlain."
6517,2020-10-09 06:24:23,j7sd0i,"Well, I wasn't saying he wasn't a leader. That wasn't the argument that I made. I just don't think he was an all-time great coach. I think if you put Larry Brown, Jeff Van Gundy, Rudy Tomjanovich or some of the other prominent coaches of the time in his place, they would have won those same championships with the personnel he fielded.

I think Phil Jackson being in this group is what is getting responses. No one seems to be bringing up Riley or Torre."
6518,2020-10-09 06:34:44,j7sd0i,"I don't know. I remember Michael Jordan hanging 63 points on the Knicks in a single game, putting the team on his back. No one could ever guard Kareem effectively against his sky hook. Kobe could be selfish, and managing him was a job in and of itself. But Shaq brought 3 separate teams to the finals in the Magic, the Lakers, and then the Heat. I think those players elevated the coaching. Karl Malone was already a great when he came to the Lakers, like Gary Payton and Steve Nash, and Jackson couldn't get them to sync up in harmony with that offense."
6519,2020-10-10 02:22:28,j7sd0i,"I was a pistons fan back in the day and hated the Bulls. At this point in my life, I think he was a good coach but since many people call him the greatest coach ever, yeah I’m down with saying that he was good but he is somewhat overrated."

I just always felt he was full of crap, that Jordan got him the rings (he never won with the Bulls without Jordan). When he speaks, for me, it comes across as high-handed. But seeing how personnel fit into a particular scheme is something that good coaches can do, and he did that. But he wasn't doing it with random guys off the street, though."

6578,2020-10-09 01:02:10,j7idfu,Yeah I can't take that kind of drama lol I unsubbed from mua a long time ago because it got really toxic and weird. I still dabble a bit in muacirclejerk though because the people there are mostly quite silly.
6579,2020-10-09 07:36:12,j7idfu,I'm surprised no one has brought up karmacourt which covers drama but satirical in nature. I thought it was a hilarious way to settle petty scores - James and Ethan could've done a judge Judy collab and roast each other off. There's so many light-hearted ways to approach it where they both can profit and get good press from the situation.
6580,2020-10-09 05:13:44,j7idfu,I simp for Ethan and he's married.
6581,2020-10-09 22:17:41,j7idfu,Uhm halo came out in 01
6582,2020-10-09 01:56:18,j7idfu,I mean most of the content creators in the beauty community are awesome! Like Smokey Glow and Raw Beauty Kristy are like my fave youtubers and they’re in the beauty community. It’s just so weird that only like 15 of the beauty “gurus” are crazy drama sucking vampires but somehow sooooo many fans in the community are so toxic. It doesn’t really make sense.
6583,2020-10-09 01:59:09,j7idfu,I've totally been meaning to check out Raw Beauty Kristy but keep forgetting to! Will check her out after I finish this Content Court 😅 I also like Robert Welsh but that's also because he makes it a point to stay out of drama!
6584,2020-10-09 03:13:50,j7idfu,I love Robert Welsh too! He blew up QUICK
6585,2020-10-09 00:50:23,j7iact,"Objection! This was clearly the responsibilities of none other than prosecutor AB, and defender A.I. Ian. They should know the evidence they're bringing to court."

6590,2020-10-08 18:37:12,j7h5gi,Honestly fuck h3 for a few reasons but I'm glad he's not letting this go. It feels like every time James does something shitty he issues a half assed apology then ignores it until it goes away. It doesnt seem like Ethan will stop until JC actually takes some accountability.
6591,2020-10-08 18:06:34,j7h5gi,"I was not a fan of this guy for criticizing girls for editing photos, then calling the same girls fat and shaped like twinkies (while he looks how he looks lol) in their unedited photos.

edit: so he’s apologized and made up with Trisha, but if the video is still up it can harm younger girls."
6592,2020-10-08 17:34:19,j7h5gi,I'm not a fan of H3 but honestly James Charles is doing what he criticizes all the time. What a hypocrite
6593,2020-10-08 17:17:51,j7h5gi,h3h3 are currently live discussing the numerous (alleged) times James Charles has drawn “inspiration” from other brands.
6594,2020-10-08 18:58:14,j7h5gi,I don't think James will address this any further. I understand why Ethan is mad but at this point it seems like he's preaching to the choir and talking about James will get him more attention. James is in the wrong but Ethan is not morally superior and now this just seems petty.
6595,2020-10-08 23:30:06,j7h5gi,"I find it hard to take the side of either of these problematic millionaires. 

At this point is there ANYONE who hasn't had a spat with James Charles? Hell, I might start one just to be included."

6601,2020-10-08 19:25:01,j7h5gi,"I find Hila to be alright but def not worth watching the H3 channel since he is constantly adding his .02 in and I find him obnoxious. This is all just manufactured, low effort drama anyway made to get eyes and views. Don't care, it's just not that interesting."

6608,2020-10-08 22:07:00,j7h5gi,"He should let it go to be honestly, now I cannot not associate Teddy Fresh with this drama, and it completely turned me away from giving the brand a solid chance when I otherwise would go completely crazy since it's so up my alley. Like sure, defend your (wife's) business, but if you do it a certain way, you risk completely ruining the image of said business. I just don't want my products to be associated with petty ass Youtube drama shit."
6609,2020-10-09 05:26:43,j7h5gi,"wow. everyone involved is awful! if anything, i think it's impressive that james charles consistently gets into drama where absolutely no one is worth rooting for. like could you imagine if james got into a feud with a content creator who was both relatively well known and well liked? birds of a feather i guess!"
6610,2020-10-08 20:06:25,j7h5gi,"He's so freaking lame. The Teddy Fresh design isn't even that original -- wow, congrats on using color theory. I'd be on his side if it was some elaborate piece of art that was clearly copy/pasted à la Urban Outfitters. Teddy Fresh did not invent color blocking and the only thing James did wrong was using similar colors and engaging in conversation with this doofus. And I don't even like James. I'm just sick of watching a grown ass man act like a toddler."
6611,2020-10-09 09:37:52,j7h5gi," God, remember how absolutely moronic he was about that  Micheal Jackson documentary !?!"
6612,2020-10-08 18:29:20,j7h5gi,I’m a subscriber to both of these creators and I honestly find this hilarious. I’m glad Ethan isn’t just forgetting about this. People are super quick to give James a pass on his shitty behaviour and him stealing from other creators has been a huge pattern in his career. Keep fighting the good fight Ethan.
6613,2020-10-08 18:48:08,j7h5gi,"Isn’t H3 known for working with Trisha Paytas and doing controversial shit together to get views up when they are low?

i don't ever want to see y'all performing the *i'm-so-woke-black-lives-matter-give-black-content-creators-a-spotlight* song and dance ever again on this sub. yous have proven time and time again that you're antiblack. be antiblack with your chests, spare us the bullshit"
6615,2020-10-08 18:34:18,j7h5gi,The irony of h3 making a video about james charles drawing 'inspiration' from other content creators with the title 'content court' which is so obviously taken from idubbbz' content cop is not lost on me
6616,2020-10-09 06:33:30,j7h5gi,"h3 can get fucked, I don't care. all people involved are way too rich to do this petty bullshit and for me to care about. Ethan has been irrelevant for years and he finally found his chance to be in the spotlight again. Congrats for falling for it. 

also side eyeing this community for defending a misogynist 😒 do your research on him"
6617,2020-10-09 00:27:46,j7h5gi,"Yes. Ethan is a hallmark ""male on the internet who has never felt one (1) consequence"",so basically a shithead. But james is a shithead too, and actually in the wrong in this situation. 

Teddy Fresh is ethan's wife's company and it was her designs that James stole. Probably not the best person in the world if she cosigns some of the shit her husband says, but it doesn't mean stealing designs from a female owned minority owned small (?) business should be ignored because the owner is in the vicinity of a trashbag. 

People tend to be bad at separating these kinds of things. Several posts have been made about how people shouldn't support TF because of this and that thing ethan has done or said. But ""Ethan is shit therefore James Charles stealing from his wife shouldn't be a big deal"" is a bad take. Both things can actually be true. You can condemn JCs ""let's just fucking steal some designs""- business model without buying teddy fresh if you don't like the owner. You can say theft of design/intellectual property/whatever at the very least morally wrong without putting money in Ethan's pockets. 

There doesn't have to be one unequivically good part and one unequivically bad part in this. There CAN be one bad action in one bad situation where one part was in the wrong."

6631,2020-10-08 18:28:08,j7h5gi,Also the fact that he defended rape by saying women are to be conquered
6632,2020-10-08 19:58:33,j7h5gi,He made some homophobic and xenophobic comments toward kpop and kpop idols that did not sit well with me at all (same reason I’m not a fan of keem star either). Not to mention dude fat shames people when his bod is not something to be desired either.
6633,2020-10-08 20:53:08,j7h5gi,I mean there’s literally a clip of Ethan essentially saying he can’t be cancelled because he’s already said the n word on live stream and nothing happened. The dude is so bitter and needs a reality check big time.
6634,2020-10-08 18:28:16,j7h5gi,"he's also, like, a misogynist, homophobe, and transphobe who built his audience off of flirting with the alt right. fuck ethan klein lmao"

6639,2020-10-08 18:32:16,j7h5gi,I wasn't a fan of it either - but he has recently admitted on one of his podcast episodes that it was in poor taste and he felt bad about it.

6643,2020-10-08 18:59:14,j7h5gi,What could even be done though? James’ response was very much ‘we don’t have the same target audience so lets move on’. Would they go to court for this?
6644,2020-10-08 19:11:03,j7h5gi,maybe i’ve just become less caring about things like this bc of the state of the world but damn 😭 it’s just youtuber merch no?

It’s a completely separate brand and entity run 100% by Hila Klein, who happens to be Ethan’s wife. Hila personally designs all TH items and Ethan and/or h3h3 have nothing to do with TF conceptually or production-wise.

So it’s not like these two influencers picked out the same stock merch hoodie. Hila pours her heart and soul into her brand, it’s her passion. And for what it’s worth she pays her employees well and provides them great benefits."

6668,2020-10-08 23:38:53,j7h5gi,"""Just"" color theory?

You go to your closet and you select out, oh I don’t know, that lumpy colorblocked sweater, for instance, because you’re trying to tell the world that you take yourself too seriously to care about what you put on your back. But what you don’t know is that that sweater is not just colorblocked, it’s not turquoise, it’s not lapis, it’s actually pastel.

You’re also blithely unaware of the fact that in 2011, Tyler the Creator launched Golf Wang and did a collection of colorblocked streetwear. And then colorblocking quickly showed up in the collections of eight different designers. Then it filtered down through the department stores and then trickled on down into some tragic “casual corner” where you, no doubt, fished it out of some clearance bin. However, that 90s hoodie represents millions of dollars and countless jobs and so it’s sort of comical how you think that you’ve made a choice that exempts you from the fashion industry when, in fact, you’re wearing pastels that were selected for you by the people in this room. From a pile of “unoriginal” designs."

6675,2020-10-08 18:29:59,j7h5gi,"Okay you know what, no. 


James definitely needs to learn humility, just say that on its own. Saying ""Shane wasn't wrong"" when he, Jeffree and Tati tried to ruin James's career with false sexual assault allegations and implied allegations is too far. Let's not forget the context. Be critical of James for his actual actions but don't go about trying to justify Shane's actions outside of the context of the situation."
6676,2020-10-08 18:15:21,j7h5gi,"I think this is going to be an issue going forward, actually - there’s so many valid criticisms of JC but the only people willing to say them are horribly problematic themselves or outright lying (Tati). It makes JC look sympathetic that he has these notorious bullies coming after him, and it discredits real areas of growth that he needs to work on!"
6677,2020-10-08 18:27:23,j7h5gi,"James Charles really dropped the ball at his ""re-do"" image. Everyone(Including me) felt sorry for the guy and he was kinda seen as the underdog. He could've salvaged that but he's just stuck in his old ways"

It's not even the mistake of copying or being inspired by existing work - it's always how it's handled and finding means to rectify the situation. Clearly if James would be so bold to have Larray, who wore the teddy fresh hoodie, in his video declaring himself innocent - Ethan responding is just fair game.

You answered your own question. You left out context and cherry picked from a statement unrelated to James's current actions.


 Saying he wasn't wrong when he said that while justifying his own shitty actions is the context you left out. I fully read what you wrote. Context matters.

**Edit:** Saying a cherry picked phrase without context

> Shane wasn't wrong when he said JC needed a slice of humble pie

Vs with context

> Shane, when he said JC needed a slice of humble pie as a way to justify his own actions of participating in an orchestrated take down of James (including false sexual allegations) and deflecting from his own actions, wasn't wrong.

The pain is real and validation of abusers is real - and he knows it, because he sees both every time yet continues to endorse such behaviour, even after apologizing.

However, my sympathy for the devil only extends as far as he's willing to improve himself. The slew of controversies doesn't show that.

Look. I don't care about kpop boys, so I have no fannish stake in this, but his first comment makes my stomach twist and his second tells me more than I ever wanted to know about his character. There are a million ways to drag BTS and their wildly intense fanbase without going *haha Asian guys are basically girls amirite? and guys who like them are gay because only the gays listen to guys who are basically girls, right? and lol @ girls who like them, how cute, maybe someday you'll grow up.*

Like — I know popular culture doesn't give a shit about Asian guys, but this is really something special. People like this are so fucking used to Asian men being irrelevant and invisible that they cannot wrap their minds around a few of them becoming powerful, desired, loved. If it happens there has to be something *pathological* about it. It isn't deep and true; it's a *fetish.* Except what fetish? BTS genderbends about as much as Harry Styles does.

Isnt this you? You sound a awful lot invested in their podcast, personalities and views so miss me with this I dont stan him bullshit."

6916,2020-10-08 16:55:32,j7g9z5,"Tough question! I’m a big fan of a lot of the movies on this list. Honestly I really haven’t seen more than three ‘40s films from any director’s list. My favorite director in general is Billy Wilder, but I think he really came into himself and found his style in the ‘50s with Sunset Boulevard (my fav of all time) and Some Like It Hot. Same with Alfred Hitchcock—most of his biggest hits (for good reason) were from the ‘50s, but I do love Rope.

My favorite standalone movies on this list are The Third Man and Shop Around the Corner. Gaslight is amazing, but I’d never watch it again because it scares the crap out of me since I know ppl who’ve been thru that kinda thing."
6917,2020-10-08 18:50:31,j7g9z5,"the cut off of 1939 films and 1950 films really cut out some masterpieces for some  

For me, give me Welles all day, every day, zero second thoughts. You could take Citizen Kane off the list and I'd still take Welles"
6918,2020-10-08 17:18:59,j7g9z5,"Wow... that's tough!

If we could add a few years from the late 30s or early 50s, I could make arguments for Hawks or Kurosawa... but given the rules, it's gotta be Hitchcock. 

Even though there are at least a dozen films on this list that I prefer to any of his movies from the '40s, Hitchcock's cinematic innovations through this period are hard to beat."
6919,2020-10-08 17:21:28,j7g9z5,"Billy Wilder is my favorite, but as I've already voted for him in the 50s poll, I'll go with the great John Ford in the 40s."
6920,2020-10-08 18:05:19,j7g9z5,"This was a surprisingly easy decade to choose my top picks from. I figured it's be a lot more difficult.    
  
• Chaplin  
• Tourneur  
• Ford  
• Renoir  
• Mizoguchi  
• K. Vidor  
• Preminger  
• Welles  
• Deren  
• Minnelli  
• Sturges  
• Cukor  
• Hitchcock  
• Mann"
6921,2020-10-08 17:17:43,j7g9z5,"Man, I need to brush up on my 40s cinema. Hitch is the only person with more than two films that I've seen."
6922,2020-10-08 18:33:06,j7g9z5,If we include the run up to these runs you have to go with Hawks. Anybody else’s career would have peaked at Only Angels Have Wings in ‘39 but that guy just DONT MISS!
6923,2020-10-08 18:54:12,j7g9z5,"Once again, great list. Honestly, you're taking out so much of the leg work for me. I'm just gonna watch these movies down the list."
6924,2020-10-08 19:28:33,j7g9z5,Orson Welles - no contest
6925,2020-10-08 20:14:02,j7g9z5,"It's neck-and-neck between Lean and Hitchcock, but I'll give it to Lean because I absolutely adore 100% of his list. Hitch has some bangers, though. His output is staggering."
6926,2020-10-08 21:13:41,j7g9z5,"Probably Wyler and Rossellini for me, but Hawks, Cukor, Huston, and Curtiz also had (surprisingly) strong showings."
6927,2020-10-09 08:44:33,j7g9z5,"I’d have to go with Powell and Pressburger. A lot of directors on this list have 2 masterpieces and several other quality films like Hitchcock, Ford, Huston, and Welles, but P&P have 3 bonafide masterpieces in Colonel Blimp, Black Narcissus, and The Red Shoes."
6928,2020-10-08 16:51:09,j7g9z5,"H-I-T-C-H-C-O-C-K. And I think Ford too, but I've yet to see all of his."
6929,2020-10-08 18:26:08,j7g9z5,"Welles, Huston or Rossellini"
6930,2020-10-08 21:48:57,j7g9z5,"Ford might take the decade for Treasures if Sierra Madre alone... my other top picks would be Kurosawa and Lang.

But dang! ain’t it incredible how prolific they all were back then? No one makes this many films in a decade anymore."
6931,2020-10-13 00:37:37,j7g9z5,"Yes, today Hitchcock and Ford are more famous, but Hawks edges them out on this list.   *Red River* is a great - absolutely great film.  *Sergeant York* could have been forgettable, but it is also great.   

Preston Sturges is the forgotten master on this list.  Watch *Sullivan's Travels* and it will give you an entirely different feel for the 1940s."
6932,2020-10-09 05:26:13,j7g9z5,"It's really hard because like many here I've only seen a handful at most from these directors during this decade.

If I had to pick I think i would be picking from Powell and Pressburger, Ford, Huston, or Rossellini. Possibly Welles if I had seen more than Citizen Kane from this decade.

What are your picks?"
6933,2020-10-09 05:29:22,j7g9z5,"My head says Hitchcock but my heart says Huston. They're both probably boring and safe picks, but Hitchcock, while known for his later works, knocked this decade out of the park. Notorious is glorious, with career best performances from Ingrid Bergman and Cary Grant(and the ever wonderful Claude Rains in a remarkably restrained role). And Rope made me fall in love with John Dall, whose career in film is a shadow of what it would have been if casting directors had a clue. I could have sworn Rope was a 50s film, that's how mature it is in it's presentation. Rebecca, Suspicion, and Saboteur are all great fun(though I will always say that Joan Fontaine didn't deserve that Oscar, and Suspicion feels a bit like a trial run for Notorious). Just a stacked decade that's hard to vote against.

Meanwhile Huston just quietly produces 3 of my favorite films ever(Falcon, Madre, and Largo), launches the career of my favorite star ever(featured in the above 3, and Across the Pacific, and Casablanca), and brings to Hollywood Sydney Greenstreet. After Casablanca, Key Largo was my first dip into classic cinema, and boy was I rewarded and never looked back. 

Hawks is also up there. He launched the lovely Montgomery Clift, pleasing me and millions of women, continued Cary Grant's control over the funny/hunky guy persona(pleasing me and millions of women), continued Humphrey Bogart's favorite role, and gave my beloved Barbara Stanwyck one of her best roles. It's pretty good."

6935,2020-10-08 20:03:27,j7g9z5,I'm not sure what is the point of this threads aside form listing a lot of titles and pointing lots of film were made by lots of people for a long time.
6936,2020-10-09 01:01:04,j7g9z5,"I don't try to worry too much about it. I just watch good movies when I can and a lot of them will happen to be classics. I've seen a chunk of this list but that's because it showed up on my watchlist as being good movies that seem interesting to me.

I will say though that if you go deeper into a decade intentionally, I would go deeper into the 50s or 60s. I think films from the 50s and 60s were more developed than the stuff from the 30s and 40s. Also the foreign film industry was hampered by WW, it recovered in the 50s and especially the 60s."
6937,2020-10-08 22:28:41,j7g9z5,Ford didn’t make Treasure that was Huston
6938,2020-10-09 10:41:29,j7g9z5,Either Ford or Welles
6939,2020-12-19 20:34:28,j7g9z5,A couple of months later but what was Bogarts favorite role?
6940,2020-10-08 20:47:48,j7g9z5,I just wanna to see what people at r/flicks think are the best Directors over different Decades (or which Director who the best of their respective decade) it’s just a fun little game
6941,2020-10-08 20:13:25,j7g9z5,I just wanted to do a fun little game that’s all
6942,2020-10-09 07:07:10,j7g9z5,"To me, a lot or movies from the 60s (and 70s) feel to modern and close to today but not quite. They feel off and they don't resonate with me as much because they deal with modern ideas, both in film making techniques and theme, but does it worse. Movies from 30s-40s feel more timeless. Both in technical and thematical aspects.

This is a simplified explanation but I think the trend is quite clear to me. I have a bit of an issue with a lot or films from the 60s and 70s."
6943,2020-10-08 22:31:50,j7g9z5,... Huston then... ... *puts on dunce cap* ...  one of the greatest flicks ever.
6944,2020-10-13 00:39:11,j7g9z5,"Well, it is a great film to be wrong about!  Good attitude.  Watch some Preston Sturges though."

6959,2020-11-11 02:50:37,jqs2jo,"I took CHEM 152 with Barrows and am currently taking BIOL 200 with Crowe. I really liked Barrows as a professor. His lectures were very good, he was clear about what he expected you to know, and his practice exams were very similar to the actual exams. However, you should be prepared to spend a lot of time working practice problems from the textbook if you want to do well. 

BIOL 200 with Crowe has been good so far but it is fairly time consuming, especially if you read the textbook carefully (which I recommend). 

I am not sure what the other classes you are thinking about taking are like, but I would recommend taking a third class that is not very time consuming if you would like to take both chem and biol."
6960,2020-11-09 07:07:01,jqs2jo,"I've taken like all of these classes except for the ANTH ones, and I totally recommend taking Psych 101 if ANTH has that much reading. Chem and bio 200 might take up most of your time. Chemistry is quite a bit of work tbh, Bio 200 was pretty dope tho."

You are still a kid, and you should just enjoy being a kid as long as you can. There really is no rush to finish growing up. You sound like a fairly well adjusted twelve year old boy, that is probably gay. There is nothing at all wrong with that. There just is no reason to rush coming out. Just come out to people you want to tell, that you can trust.

I hope that you can find other boys that are also gay, that you can talk to. If nothing else, see if there are subedits for boys like you. You can also see if there are any gay youth groups in your area."

Just as loved, just as doted on, and just as respected as his brother. I so far haven't found a fic that doesn't throw Harry away or push him to the side because of his brother. I was really into the idea of this when the explanation first started out, I could even understand the James focusing more on Harry's brother because he wasn't applying himself. However, I would have liked Harry to be aware of this fact and, as the more mature twin, to understand that he is still as important to his parents.

I would also love to see a fic where Harry might not be fawned over at Hogwarts but he does develop his own true friendships. Maybe with Hermione and Neville. Hermione would be just as studious as he, and Neville would be shy and need a friend that could boost his confidence and bring out his inner badass."

6989,2020-11-09 08:20:23,jqlwkv,"Up until you revealed teh gay, it was okay. The massive AU of a gay James and Sirius would definitly warrant a warning before people fell into your trap. But whatever. If that's your thing, that's your thing.

But a lot of things makes no sense, really. Harry in this scenario has been in magic for years with his family. There's no suspense or surprise about him ""finding out"" that he has magic. They've all known for years that he has magic. So that method of him ""discovering infidelity"" is bunk, imo. You would have to have a different scenario for me to believe it.

Everyone knows harry has magic. The only reason that canon had him learning about magic at midnight on his birthday was because of the actions of Vernon denying him his letter and dragging them to the island and Hagrid visiting them there. So having him all excited about his letter at midnight so that he finds out his father's infidelity is dumb and stretching things to fit canon.

In canon the letter arrived a week or so before his birthday. So Harry and his twin would have woken up in the morning on that day a week before their birthday to find their Hogwarts invite. No drama, sorry.

I do like the idea of an ailing and coma ridden Lily who sacrificed herself for her sons. It's very noble and fits my idea of Harry's parents. It's just that in this fic, James didn't die when trying to divert Voldymorty. So life happens in the time after the event. That totally makes sense.

The idea of a James finding comfort in someone else's arms isn't bad, especially if Lily forced him to promise to do so if something happened to her. The resulting misunderstanding between Harry and his Father when he finds out about the tryst is a good drama point. That would definitely cause conflict between father and son.

Obviously Harry would feel that James is cheating on their mother. And that misunderstanding could last for as long as you want.

As long as you're not making James actually cheat on Lily, I wouldn't care if he was going for a gay relationship. I find gay relationships much less objectionable than cheating on your spouse. Go figure.

I do have to question the idea that Harry wants to punish his family by revealing their ""skeletons in the closet"" to the public. They've been raised with the knowledge of the dark families wanting them dead. So having Harry throw a hissy fit so that his dad ""admits wrongdoing publicly"" will basically turn his whole family into chum for the piranhas to feast on. Is Harry an idiot? And does he want his family to be attacked for the public airing of laundry?

Remember, this is a Harry that has been raised in the Wizarding world with his father, the Head of the Potter Family, and Sirius Black, the Head of the Black Family. There's no way he doesn't know about politics. Trying to shoehorn in the canon Harry Potter's behavior and reactions into this version of Wizarding!Harry Potter is just...I dunno....I just can't get behind it. It's...lacking.

I think it would be much more effective if Harry leaves because he doesn't see any progress from his father in searching for a healing for his mother. Harry thinks its cause his father already has a replacement for his mother, so he isn't trying too hard. And Harry thinks that if he's away from that environment, he can focus on researching a cure for his mother above all.

So there's plenty of room there for his twin to fall into Dumbledore's traps, er... obstacle courses! That Harry needs to save him from. And all that while Harry is estranged from the family and seeking a cure for his beloved mother."
6990,2020-11-09 11:31:20,jqlwkv,"Haven't seen the 'sick wife' scenario too often, and never done like this. Unfortunately, I think many readers would automatically see that trope and think linkffn(11585823), so it might be stale for them already - even if they differ overall, the last note about finding a cure stuck with me. 

I don't think the matter of James having an *affair* in itself is unbelievable, but with Sirius? Meh. It doesn't click with me. I think he'd be more likely to find someone else - Sirius just seems 'too easy' an excuse, you know?"
6991,2020-11-09 17:40:14,jqlwkv,"I completely understand this but I took this path because I wanted Harry to still be a child at the end of the day. No matter how mature he is, he still doesn't know everything and often misinterprets stuff or makes the wrong call.

The idea was for Harry to focus more on the negatives than the positives (over-inflating the small/few instances regarding his brother Charles) with a lot of his past grievances bubbling to the surface after he found out about James and Sirius, but pushing them down because he thinks he's being immature.

I really want Harry running away to be this huge culmination of years and years of hiding how he really felt about things. Not having anyone to talk to about his mum, feeling like he didn't matter to his dad, feeling that no matter what he accomplishes he'll never compare to surviving a Killing Curse (especially if he does fantastic things that people actually praise him for, but his self-esteem is so low that he doesn't realise it). I really want to write a WBWL Harry whose situation is bad but it isn't as bad as he thinks, thus he is just spiralling because everyone either assumes he's okay or they don't/can't get through to him."

6993,2020-11-09 09:41:03,jqlwkv,"> I find gay relationships much less objectionable than cheating on your spouse. Go figure.

As....is obvious......."
6994,2020-11-09 08:30:30,jqlwkv,"Harry, in canon, is quite vindictive. So I think it's perfectly in character that (as a 13 - 14 y/o boy) he would want to publically destroy his father and godfather, consequences be damned. Which is why I had Harry sworn to secrecy so HE couldn't do it. Additionally, Harry wanting to cure his mother (and not feeling like his dad is doing enough) is an add-on to his reasoning to leave.

I really like your idea on Lily sanctioning it but there being a misunderstanding between father and son that leads to the anger. And with emotions running high they never really get to talk about it.

Also, Harry doesn't 'discover magic' when he gets his Hogwarts letter, he's just excited that he got it. Of course he already knew he was going, but he's an excited 11 y/o. And it's fanfiction, I'm already savaging canon here with this AU, making the letter come a week later is hardly world breaking.

And now that I've actively engaged with your points, putting ""teh gay"" in a story isn't a trap and doesn't require a warning. If you're too weak to accept two men being together, just don't read it, it's not hurting you. Got some mad homophobe vibes off of your entire comment and it's mad that you'd be that comfortable saying shit like that on here."

Yeah, you're totally right about teenagers being irrational, so I can totally see Harry spreading his family issues around in his chuunyubou phase. I'm just saying that you need to come up with a believable reason that Harry would do that kind of thing after being raised in the wizarding world.

Hey if you want to portray Harry as excitable and wanting to show off his Hogwarts letter, then you need to write it that way. My original comment was just pointing out the problems with equating your story with canon. There are a lot of differences there. So if you want to have Harry rushing with his letter to his father to show it off, there's no reason you cant' do that.

Like, I get that you don't like me raining on your parade. I knew it wouldn't be popular to criticize your ideas.

So...I hope your fic gains traction. I hope you have fun writing it.

7005,2020-11-09 18:53:43,jqlwkv,"I'm not implying that, but if that is how you interpret it I do apologise. I am bi myself.

I was drawing from a stereotype/trope of healthy spouses cheating on their ill/disabled other halves. I only picked Sirius because he is:

A: the closest to James after Lily.

And,

B: it would come with potential drama/fallout in 1990's magical Britain where (in this story at least) even Albus Dumbledore cannot be open about his sexuality.

In the planning of this fic, I wanted to explore Harry, Charles and James as three distinct narrators. Although the main focus is on Harry, there would be Charles (in the middle of a family conflict as well as the Voldemort storyline) and James (coming to terms with his sexuality and the guilt and fear he feels for going through with it in such a hateful society).

I also am undecided on whether I want to use the idea of Lily encouraging James's relationship with Sirius, but I am leaning towards it (just need to rework some things in the plans of the story in regards to Harry and James). I don't ever like playing tropes straight, so it works as I don't want James to ACTUALLY cheat on Lily as I don't believe he ever would.

I want there to be a more than meets the eye bit to the story afterall."

7007,2020-11-10 20:15:08,jqlwkv,"Oh Really? It was my mistake?

They imagined a world where Harry never went to the Dursleys and lived with his father, brother, and uncle padfoot. And yet they still hit the same plot points as the canon version where he lived with the Dursleys. So I was pointing out how wrong it was to graft canon events onto their reimagined world.

If you want to reimagine a world where things go different, like Fanfiction, then you need to adjust how the timeline goes. If you're just going to make it the same as canon despite all the differences, then...

Fuck it. I'm not going to pedantically explain it. If you're so bothered to misunderstand my points, then you're obviously going to misunderstand any explanation I give. Whatever. Piss off."
7008,2020-11-09 19:54:38,jqlwkv,"The idea of three point narrative sounds nicely rounded. 

As long as Charles don't end up too insufferable I would love to see his side of a story and how he receives his brother and father conflict. Same to Harry being too angsty and stupid or James being the Worst Father of the Year. 

They all are human and realistic description would go a long way for any story. To have their character flaws while being likeable. It would be interesting to read story like that when you cannot clearly choose a side Cuz the dillemas of characters are shown in a way that makes you unable to make judgment without being totally hypocritical about it :D"

It peaked between the late 1940s and mid- 1950s, when his scarce and highly original gowns were sought after by society's most prominent women. Personally draping and constructing the garments that bear his label, he is considered to be the only American to work in the true couture tradition. James saw himself as an artist and sculptor of dress rather than a dressmaker. He manipulated fabrics into dramatic shapes using complex seaming and sometimes complicated understructures to create his singular vision of timeless elegance. A master of the relationship between form, color and texture, he often heightened the drama of his evening wear by combining several like fabrics of different colors, or different fabrics in like colors but with different light reflective qualities."

Then there goes with activity. They all need to be on at the same time at the same spot because location and timing means ALOT since people who can find you attractive might of passed by you but you werent on. 

I dont like the idea of trying to find if there are any biases and pretending to be another race to find if there is or not. It's just very self deprecating when the info you find doesnt go your way. At the end of the day its like, okay now what? What are you going to do with the data / results that youve found? You cant really do much.

So if this is an absolute scale, nobody gets laid in the end. And we all feel bad because ""why did he reject me"", well, same reason you rejected someone else. If we all broaden our horizon a bit, all goes well.

For me I turn in word and just work on things that I want to do and how I want to better myself. I think cooking is sexy and a good quality to have in a guy. So I started to learn how to make a few dishes to impress dates or a potluck. 

Everyone is dealt with a set of cards when they’re born. You can’t focus on what if you were dealt better cards but instead should just work with what you got and make the best out of it. 

Gay relationships are complicated. I don’t really have all the answers to help fix your tendencies to compare. Just work on yourself and try to see yourself as someone you’d like to date. And once you know your worth, you won’t need to compare yourself to know that you’re worth loving."

7072,2020-11-06 23:11:40,jpfita,No wonder he has been so against all these celebrity makeup lines lately.
7073,2020-11-06 23:58:36,jpfita,Omg I bet he’s gonna come out with the first ever rainbow palette😍 creative icon
7074,2020-11-06 23:42:13,jpfita,"From a business point of view, it's honestly been a long time coming.

He's beyond morphe now. He is wise to capitalise on this"
7075,2020-11-06 23:06:26,jpfita,Does it come with a subscription to photoshop?
7076,2020-11-06 23:34:32,jpfita,Please don’t be a freckle product cause those were some horrible fake freckles on the mag!!
7077,2020-11-06 23:20:09,jpfita,Imagine if he meant his morphe palette lmao
7078,2020-11-06 23:22:32,jpfita,If it’s another colourful palette I will laugh my ass off🤣🤣🤣 i hope James is putting a little more creativity into it
7079,2020-11-06 23:02:49,jpfita,Yawn. Who isn’t?
7080,2020-11-07 02:10:57,jpfita,I wonder if this is a standalone brand or we'll find out later that it is under the Morphe umbrella just like JH
7081,2020-11-06 23:43:37,jpfita,"Idk, all I'm seeing is stupid fake freckles in rAinBoW, and my soul starts to wither away."
7082,2020-11-07 01:08:24,jpfita,His makeup really does look incredible in this picture though.
7083,2020-11-07 01:26:32,jpfita,omg another makeup brand from a cis white man??? color me stoked!
7084,2020-11-07 01:55:55,jpfita,Yeah.... Not interested.
7085,2020-11-06 23:19:59,jpfita,I can't wait for the overdone fake lip filler trend to die
7086,2020-11-07 01:23:24,jpfita,Do y'all think he'll search the internet and complain about people who give his makeup a bad review again like how he did with his Morphe palette?
7087,2020-11-06 23:54:20,jpfita,Every time a new influencer comes out with their line I’m almost annoyed lol. Like another one? Really? Is it at least going to be good or different? The market is just sooooo saturated now that unless they’re coming out with something unique or exceptionally good I’m not interested.
7088,2020-11-07 00:32:14,jpfita,NEXT
7089,2020-11-06 23:41:36,jpfita,"Morphe better not be retiring his palette, cause it looks like that's going to be another rainbow line/ palette from him. 

That hot pink in his morphe palette is my favourite pink eye shadow"
7090,2020-11-07 00:17:02,jpfita,Oh
7091,2020-11-07 01:45:09,jpfita,God I'm tired of him
7092,2020-11-07 02:13:27,jpfita,Don’t these beauty gurus realize how over saturated the market is? Read the room.
7093,2020-11-06 23:36:15,jpfita,Right.. I remember someone posting about home coming out with a line a while ago on this sub and that was my comment. That he criticizes every line that comes out. It is hypocritical  🙄
7094,2020-11-07 01:10:06,jpfita,The sarcasm in this comment sent me cackling
7095,2020-11-07 00:49:43,jpfita,Mini palette release of his mini pallette. It's keychain-sized.
7096,2020-11-06 23:37:09,jpfita,"🤣🤣🤣🤣


Esp since all they did was take the morphe 35b and rearranged. I don't care for JH but at least hers was different"
7097,2020-11-07 00:16:44,jpfita,How is it hypocritical? His career is makeup. His criticism of other makeup lines from celebrities is that they were cashing in on something they weren't passionate about.
7098,2020-11-07 01:44:44,jpfita,"Okay I actually love this idea but like .. as more of a gimmick, it would be so cute"
7099,2020-11-07 01:02:59,jpfita,"He said that about AK, but for LC, he just said she had “no business having a makeup line” (despite having been in & around the biz before) & ended it with, “Stop making makeup brands! Stop! Stop!"" I don’t have a dog in this race, but I am assuming that’s what people are referring to when they’re talking about hypocrisy."
7100,2020-11-07 00:32:38,jpfita,"Because if you’re good at what you do and your products are actually decent, it won’t matter if there is competition. Would he be saying the same things if he didn’t happen to get famous? Of course people with a platform are going to capitalize on a huge trend"
7101,2020-11-07 00:48:05,jpfita,"You're arguing that his criticism was wrong, not that it was hypocritical. I'm saying it wasn't hypocritical. I'm not here to defend JC, I just think it's silly to call him hypocritical."
7102,2020-11-07 04:02:07,jpfita,Telling Lauren fuckin Conrad that she has less credibility than him as far as making a makeup line...I’d call that hypocritical
7103,2020-11-06 20:36:17,jpcnzf,"Off topic, but I wish that this was the photo on the actual cover. The one they chose is still really awesome, but I just don’t think it is very Vogue-esque for it to be the cover photo."
7104,2020-11-07 13:08:16,jpcnzf,"Literally all of these things - pastel freckles, stars on the inner corner, rainbow eye but with more muted tones, blush nose, ombre lips are just popular trends that have existed WAY before JC and Judas Tape."
7105,2020-11-06 20:44:20,jpcnzf,"If only a couple of elements would have been similar I would have given him the benefit of the doubt but... the colorful star freckles, the same lip shade and style + the eyeshadow being exactly replicated with the colors placed exactly the same... suspicious. Especially since he recently copied a sweater from another brand and didn't bother changing the colors around there as well. Such behavior doesn't reflect well on him as a professional business person."
7106,2020-11-06 20:39:08,jpcnzf,"The stars on the inner corner, the colors generally all the way around are similar, that red Rudolph nose and obviously the poke dots, placement of bottom lashes....similar yes like most colorful looks but it’s too similar and I would say probably did use it as reference"
7107,2020-11-06 20:34:29,jpcnzf,"It's a colorful look that's hardly original. A lot of people paint like this,even he created lots of similar looks when he released his palette. I doubt he had to 'copy' it from that person, I even doubt he has any idea who they are."
7108,2020-11-06 20:42:01,jpcnzf,James Charles copying a look? Well I never...
7109,2020-11-06 20:49:03,jpcnzf,"I get that rainbow eye looks are not super original but there are so many elements that are the same, it's too much to be coincidence. He has recreated a few of their looks before so I don't find this to be a stretch."
7110,2020-11-06 20:48:52,jpcnzf,"Guys, check out the [closeup of the face chart without lashes](https://imgur.com/a/lkpN5b4). I have been dismissive at first, but... Pastel freckles, stars in the corners of the eyes, position of colours of eyeshadows and blush+highlight on the tip of the nose. So many similarities."
7111,2020-11-06 20:42:08,jpcnzf,"The only similarity I would say is incriminating is maybe the colourful freckles. The eye look is a common colour story for colourful eyes and he didnt copy the lips, eyebrows or highlight. 

I get that he's unpopular here and hes been accused of copying before but I seriously dont think that's the case here."
7112,2020-11-06 20:50:17,jpcnzf,"Feel like I might get downvoted first this but... I don’t think creating a makeup look and doing a digital face chart are the same thing at all. 

One is completely digital art and the other is done using completely physical medium on a human face. It’s inherently too different to claim copying.

Inspiration, sure. But everything is inspired by something else - every song, painting, fashion, etc. has influence from previous works seen or heard by the artist. And they are usually never given direct credit.

Edit: I’ve been informed that she did post the look on a person, but the looks aren’t that similar at all. Last pic in the collage.

7113,2020-11-06 20:37:51,jpcnzf,I don't think it is. Rainbow looks usually look like that. The color placement is optimal for a smooth blending and fading.
7114,2020-11-08 19:53:59,jpcnzf,"omg, spot on!

![gif](giphy|oCCLHVNt8YO64)"
7115,2020-11-06 21:52:06,jpcnzf,Am I the only one that doesn't see any resemblance other than the fact that they're both colorful but that's it?
7116,2020-11-06 21:02:00,jpcnzf,"It reminds me of this ANTM shoot. 


https://images.app.goo.gl/xevpbUu8zxBqvXCe6

It’s not the most unique idea, even if it is very pretty."
7117,2020-11-06 20:26:47,jpcnzf,"James Charles makeup look for his Vogue cover looks extremely similar to Judas Tape face chart. Coincidence? There is no credit for Judas Tape look in any of JC posts.

Judas Tape actually shared the similarity of the look on their story but I don’t have the screenshot of that."
7118,2020-11-08 02:33:00,jpcnzf,I don’t see it but tbh every rainbow look ends up looking the same to me lol
7119,2020-11-08 19:55:13,jpcnzf,IS there anything he doesnt copy?!
7120,2020-11-06 23:06:02,jpcnzf,those lashes are not needed!!!! STOP
7121,2020-11-06 20:54:10,jpcnzf,"This! In fact I wasn't impressed by the chosen photo because it was rather disorienting, for the lack of the better word. But this one is so nice! I also love his eyebrows here - he's come a long way since his Covergirl days."
7122,2020-11-07 05:25:40,jpcnzf,"International Vogue magazines tend to be edgier, less commercial. In America, they would have gone with a different cover."
7123,2020-11-07 01:09:47,jpcnzf,Honestly the only thing I could focus on in the actual Vogue cover was his nostrils. I don't know if it was the framing or what but it was just... off.
7124,2020-11-06 20:41:16,jpcnzf,He has recreated at least two of their looks before so he does know who they are.
7125,2020-11-07 02:17:49,jpcnzf,"I'm not gonna lie, I see recreations everywhere on the beauty sphere, and it's okay if you credit! But as visual artist, I see both copies, studies and inspired pieces everyday, if you compare the 2 images, this was not inspired, this is a direct copy, the shape of the eyes, the color placement, the nose blush and the inner corner stars are almost exactly the same. He even got to do a similar lash shape! It's waaay too close to ignore."
7126,2020-11-06 20:41:44,jpcnzf,"True, but JC recreated a halloween look from Judas Tape and gave credit, so he definitely knows who they are."
7127,2020-11-06 20:59:28,jpcnzf,She also posted the photo of the look on the model along with the pics of the chart.
7128,2020-11-06 22:54:33,jpcnzf,No. I don’t really see it either.
7129,2020-11-06 21:03:10,jpcnzf,"Ah ok, I wasn’t aware of that. I’ll look into it.

Edit: the finished looks do not look similar at all."

""Stop making makeup brands....stop! stop!"""
7131,2020-11-06 20:01:00,jpbu8x,That makeup line could be the star of a show called “Makeup Lines I Don’t Care About”.
7132,2020-11-06 19:58:23,jpbu8x,"Other celebrities, please stop coming up with beauty lines.. y'all know nothing bout full beat and coverage and colors and stuff. By the way, I was wearing my own (not Morphe) line on that Vogue cover.. hehe

- J C"
7133,2020-11-06 21:26:25,jpbu8x,"It won't happen, but it would be \*chef's kiss\* if all the women James talked shit on about creating makeup lines came out and talked about how we definitely don't need anymore created by white men who already run the beauty industry."
7134,2020-11-06 21:05:02,jpbu8x,"But does he have the authority, knowledge and true expertise to release one?  


Of course, he's the only one that does. Even people releasing lines that have been applying makeup since before he was born and have had extensive crossover with the industry do not since they don't upload makeup youtube videos. Heck makeup brand owners have no expertise to contribute to makeup documentaries even when they do upload videos!! - the ""Marlena being asked to participate in a document making JC foam at the mouth"" painful drama, if you didn't get the reference.  


So this is what we have been waiting for all our lives. The true makeup revolution coming from the only real artist and makeup influencer in one.  


I usually ignore his posts, but heck, only commenting on this because his arrogance towards anyone else wanting a piece of the pie deserves some snickering. It's just a whole pattern of self-aggrandising behaviour I have neither the patience nor the energy for.  


I'm sure it will do great and I did think the cover looked pretty and the products had a cool editorial bright vibe to them, even though it's not a brand I would support or buy from. I don't doubt he's bringing something worthy to the industry - whether you like him or his products or not, just having a huge and willing fanbase does qualify you to sign up to make money from it as it's a business at the end of the day. 

I also do like he's bringing an element of colour and having fun slapping it on your face - at the end of the day I also like seeing brands pushing makeup as fun and not just ""utilitarian"" and reliable ones. There's space for everyone. I'm personally sick of new brands and constant releases, sure - but they will appeal to different people with different tastes, and that's fine. So long as he has good products and good customer service to keep his customers happy, what's the problem? He's so easy to ignore if he's annoying, all we need to do is not constantly post him on here. I don't see him or follow him anywhere - only am I reminded that he's around from the constant posting here."
7135,2020-11-06 20:40:08,jpbu8x,I bet his line is about as fun as this fun fact.
7136,2020-11-07 02:18:44,jpbu8x,I swear if it’s a rainbow eye shadow palette
7137,2020-11-06 22:00:47,jpbu8x,The only thing he should be releasing is a Facetune type app.
7138,2020-11-06 19:53:24,jpbu8x,I'm sick of celebrity makeup lines but it does actually make sense for him to come out with one.
7139,2020-11-07 13:04:21,jpbu8x,"This is the pettiest thing I am ever going to write on the internet BUT 

1. I find it funny when someone is on the cover of an international Vogue and they magically drop the country name whenever they say they were on the cover of Vogue. You were on the cover of A Vogue but not THE Vogue. Vogue has a circulation of 1.2 million while Vogue Portugal has 40k... 

And 2. Vogue Portugal did [this](https://www.creativemoment.co/vogue) in July 2020 soooooo I don’t really know about them..."
7140,2020-11-06 22:30:22,jpbu8x,Idc. I’m actually kind of intrigued to see his line lol
7141,2020-11-06 20:12:42,jpbu8x,"Maybe it will take 2+ years to release? Because like, he spent a really really long time picking colors and formulas/s"
7142,2020-11-07 02:30:06,jpbu8x,Can’t wait to gatekeep it
7143,2020-11-06 21:40:19,jpbu8x,"Not only is the makeup industry over saturated with celebrities and influencers releasing their own brands, I just think that now is an pretty bad time in general to launch a new brand when we're seeing people wearing less and less makeup due to having to wear masks. I know my own makeup consumption has dropped considerably over the last couple of months. I can't even remember the last time I bought a new product or felt excited to go out and buy something new.  

The reality is that not all of these brands that we're seeing at present will last long term, not only will the market just simply not accommodate them all, but people's interest (especially on brands that heavily rely on the name of the creator) will dip as interests change. I do wonder if maybe the smartest thing to do right now is just to continue collaborating with already established brands instead of investing in your own line. But what do I know."
7144,2020-11-06 20:43:01,jpbu8x,"Good luck to him, hope it's not scammy/scummy, I don't care and I won't buy."
7145,2020-11-06 22:50:42,jpbu8x,Ah so this is why he’s been so aggressive about other influences/celebs lines lol
7146,2020-11-07 10:35:49,jpbu8x,"Why not come out with a photo editing app instead, since that seems to be his true area of expertise? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
7147,2020-11-06 19:52:04,jpbu8x,So many makeup lines
7148,2020-11-06 19:53:04,jpbu8x,"Just what the beauty space needed, another influencer makeup brand."
7149,2020-11-06 20:24:33,jpbu8x,If he knows what's good for him he'll send giant apology pr packages to LC and Alicia Keys
7150,2020-11-06 20:02:21,jpbu8x,Meh
7151,2020-11-07 13:47:33,jpbu8x,"Hear me out, anyone else remember when JC swore up and down he would never come out with a makeup line that it just was not for him even after his Morphe collab he showed no interest and stated he had none in coming out with his own brand. I wonder what made him change his mind?"
7152,2020-11-07 04:13:47,jpbu8x,"If women who spent decades with pro MUAs who had to work with makeup for stage, photos, films and more have no place in the beauty industry, what qualifies a 21 year old who spent few years playing with makeup in his home who also spent half of his career with mismatched foundation and streaky bronzers to create a line?"
7153,2020-11-07 02:21:32,jpbu8x,So who wants to put down odds that he'll rip off another brand's line like he did with the clothing?
7154,2020-11-06 19:40:49,jpbu8x,Doesn't surprise me at all after his palette with Morphe
7155,2020-11-07 15:33:45,jpbu8x,"Makes sense why he keeps popping off whenever anyone launches a brand. Doesn’t want the competition, or he’s banking on the words ‘make up brand’ and ‘James Charles’ sprinkling enough seeds to get people interested in his version. It’ll be successful regardless because of his following.

Also, his nose in that thumbnail is one Facetune nudge away from vanishing altogether."
7156,2020-11-07 23:15:06,jpbu8x,"...so was all of it his line, or no?

because the bold colors that were really opaque could be interesting - but they looked more like acrylic paint lol, not something that would be that interesting to mainstream makeup users, more akin to stage makeup for special uses.

that could explain why i was so bothered by the out-of-place sheer lip color tho lmao, that's what he's going to release and they had to shoehorn it in there,"
7157,2020-11-06 20:13:01,jpbu8x,I don’t know why people are against more brands??? More brands = more options for people. Didn’t everyone say the same thing about rare beauty???
7158,2020-11-06 21:00:28,jpbu8x,"His social media/YouTube followers will make sure it sells out. From a creative standpoint, I’m expecting a lot because James is very creative naturally. I can see this being the 2.0 Kylie Cosmetics of influencer lines."
7159,2020-11-06 22:50:03,jpbu8x,Oh so this is why he didn’t want other people coming out with brands. Got it.

JC creating his revolutionary rainbow palette for his new line"
7161,2020-11-06 22:17:10,jpbu8x,"It’s truly laughable how much he complains about other people’s lines, yet he considers himself to be qualified to have his own. He’s a very creative and talented kid, but he’s far from being a seasoned makeup artist or business expert. If we’re being realistic, James started doing his friend’s makeup and his own, has not had any sort of training/education and has never worked as a MUA. Coming out with a beauty line requires way more than knowing how to come up with pretty looks and that’s a hard lesson that a lot of influencers needed to learn, like Jaclyn. It’s James’ turn now, I guess."
7162,2020-11-06 21:17:52,jpbu8x,Can’t wait to see the drama with this launch lol people still haven’t gotten their merch ya’ll ain’t gonna get the makeup either lol

I want to have a sense of control of who I want to make famous and give PR to. I feel like I totally lost that sense of control and it makes me feel uneasy.

I won’t be commenting, watching, following, liking, upvoting anything about him from now on. I’m gonna act like he doesn’t exist."

He really is so egotistical and I don't understand how he's convinced people he's changed, when he clearly hasn't.

&#x200B;

Edit to add- Most of his makeup looks, pre-photoshop/facetune aren't even that great? He's not a professional/working MUA and outside of overly filtered/edited instagram looks has little to no expertise in the beauty world. The man can't even match his own foundation correctly and he wants to try and sell us makeup??? Please."

He's the one who puts out shady tweets or lives talking about all these people coming out with Makeup while he's behind the scenes coming out with makeup.

7201,2020-11-07 01:33:16,jpbu8x,"Honestly, my biggest issue with ""that woman"" is the whole bag of assorted misogyny it comes with. 

And after I'm done drawing a heavy breath about that and calming down my feminism, just overall have no time for lil shits like him. Uh-hum, nope, get outta here, son.

He definitely has some talent despite pigeonholing himself (notable exception the Vogue cover, but even if he had full creative control, which I highly doubt, it's to be expected to not do his usual style for a publication such as this) and he has passion and undeniably works hard. However, plenty of people do and they don't get involved in all the drama he has, so that's not enough to make a fan. Plus his career beginnings were built on lies, which I'm iffy about when there's plenty of people hustling hard and honestly and never getting an opportunity to really get going.

While I understand that digital manipulation can be an art too, it's not a field of interest of mine in general, and I definitely dislike it when mixed with makeup (because I love makeup and want to see it and how it plays with people's natural skin texture and features), and not a fan when used by influencers overall to promote completely unrealistic appearance standards, so I don't care how talented he is at that personally.

I frankly just ignore him. He's not my vibe, and I don't want to waste my time on him, so I usually skip anything about him. At the end of the day, it gets difficult for people to constantly be hated online, even if they deserve some of it, and I don't really like being a part of that. He deserved this dig after barking at anyone wanting to do something he hasn't done in beauty yet (and yeah, it wasn't just brands, there's the documentary). But otherwise... I just try to think of the young makeup boys he may be inspiring to wear their makeup proudly. That's a good thing he surely has done at least for a few kids. So long as they don't pick up his worse habits, ya know. Like I said, he's incredibly easy to ignore unless you're a regular of this sub, so I prefer to focus on creators I enjoy."
7202,2020-11-07 14:59:17,jpbu8x,"I meant for the brand, not the photoshoot. Of course this is common for photoshoots.

And yes, many brands are doing it too, but we could always have more with that type of drive, especially since many are small indies people around the world usually can't afford to get after shipping and customs, and it's likely his will be more accessible. I'm not interested myself, but I can still admit it will have value for some other people."

7206,2020-11-06 23:12:46,jpbu8x,I think he was against more *celebrity* brands-like he wanted the only people releasing brands to be BGs. He didn’t think LC or Selena Gomez or Alicia Keys should have released brands because he didn’t think they had anything to do with makeup or beauty or whatever.
7207,2020-11-07 00:00:35,jpbu8x,Not when it was announced. People had hundreds of comments mocking it and saying it was so dumb. Then it came out and everyone loved it
7208,2020-11-06 21:05:53,jpbu8x,I agree with this but unfortunately the majority of cosmetic consumers don’t get one flying fuck about this. The people who flock to Sephora/Ulta at every launch or the influencers that have cabinets full of PR makeup and yet carry on like that isn’t a massive problem and never ONCE talk about it in their videos are just contributing to the industry’s lack of concern about its carbon footprint.
7209,2020-11-07 11:43:31,jpbu8x,Didn’t James at some point said he’s not coming out with his own brand 🤔 am I bugging?
7210,2020-11-06 20:58:37,jpbu8x,"Likely *why* he was throwing shade. It's harder to sell your products as unique and mind-blowing when there's a new celeb/beauty guru makeup line every month.  
The market is oversaturated, and unfortunately some of the BGs are opting for attacking other brands rather than innovating and letting their product do the talking."
7211,2020-11-10 02:53:10,jpbu8x,"I’ve actually heard that at this point, it’s not that hard to quickly pump out a beauty line. I want to say it was in a Caroline Hirons video where she reviewed Kylie Skin...idk, but basically cosmetics manufacturers can apparently get a whole launch and range through concept, some type of testing, marketing, and production in like a week now. It’s become really streamlined and easy to do, which is part of the reason EVERYONE has a line these days.

So now when influencers or celebrities are like, “I’ve been working on this for SO long, you guys,” I’m like, “Have you though?”"

7231,2020-11-04 15:16:57,jnxtvb,"Holy cow another 7 rounder. Great job OP getting through all this. Excited to see how your player rankings shift around as you continue to learn about these guys and as the season progresses.

Vikes notes:

I like targeting OL early. Is there any reason you went for Humphrey over Davis?

I love love love Zach Wilson to us, but I would bet my left nut that he doesn't make it to 72. He's looking like he might actually leap frog Trey Lance as QB3 in this class.

Levi O is a great pick at a solid value that fills a high need. So are Hamsah, Zion

I haven't wachted/read about Rodarius Williams, ISM, Cunningham or Smith, but I think their positions make sense in that order.

Also for future reference, I don't think we actually gave our 7th to KC. I know where you're seeing it in Tankathon, but that 7th was traded to KC conditionally for Mark Fields, who was waived a few weeks after the trade. I'm not sure what the conditions are, but I'm pretty sure waiving Fields nullifies the 7th.

Misc notes:

Waddle to CIN is interesting, but I have a hard time seeing them not go OL with their first pick. Maybe you aren't seeing a good value there, but Davis, Randunz, Cosmi, and Leatherwood all make sense to me.

I think ETN to ARI will get some heat from Cards fans, especially with how vocal fans have been on this sub about the need for a CB. I think it's interesting. I'm not completely sure how I feel about Edmonds yet as the lead back."
7232,2020-11-04 15:46:35,jnxtvb,"It's almost hilarious how badly BoB screwed over Houston with their future draft picks.

Also, if Surtain is still there when Atlanta picks, I can't see them taking a developmental QB who might play in two years when the defense is still filled with holes."
7233,2020-11-04 16:41:57,jnxtvb,"I love most of the picks but I can’t really see Bucs going RB, WR in the first two rounds."
7234,2020-11-04 16:01:53,jnxtvb,If Jevon Holland falls to the 3rd round I will poop my pants
7235,2020-11-04 17:42:49,jnxtvb,The Jets do not need an off ball linebacker. If we take one before like the 5th round it just feels like a wasted opportunity to pick someone at much greater position of need.
7236,2020-11-04 15:29:31,jnxtvb,As a Colts fan I like this draft.  Hopefully we can get our second round receivers to stay healthy someday.
7237,2020-11-04 17:29:42,jnxtvb,"I can dig this one. I like Friermuth with the Rams pick much more than I like Brevin Jordan last week.

Side note, I can see why he falls in your draft as of right now, but at his current pace, Zach Wilson is playing himself into the first round."
7238,2020-11-04 16:59:38,jnxtvb,"I’m sure you’re sick of being told it by now but idk if I’d want a RB round one. I love the draft other than that pick and I don’t hate it tbh. Personally I’d rather address the secondary in round one and take a RB in 3-4 but if this ended up happening I wouldn’t be mad, hard not to at least be excited about adding him to our Offense. Great work man"
7239,2020-11-04 20:06:10,jnxtvb,"49ers are going to be in better shape at CB than it appears at the moment (Verrett, Moseley, Williams and maybe Sherman) so while I am ok with Wyatt Davis in THIS draft version, if they take Adebo while Zach Wilson is on the board I'm going to drive to Santa Clara, remove my white glove and slap both Lynch and Shanahan in the face. 

We need a QB1"
7240,2020-11-04 16:10:25,jnxtvb,"Great job ! 

Speaking from Dallas fan perspective, I don't see them spending a premium selection at this moment on a Pass rusher there with having Lawerance, and reportedly ready to sign Aldon Smith to a long term contract at some point. Not to mention Jerry loves Randy Gregory and they still have him for another season. In this scenario I'd think Dallas would look at Surtain. And maybe a Marvin Wilson in the second in your scenario. (Although I see Wilson as a day 1 prospect). 

I would LOVEEEEEEE if Jevon Holland is picked by the cowboys in the third however I see him pushing for a late day 1 early day 2 guy."
7241,2020-11-04 17:44:54,jnxtvb,"3 things and probably a long post lol:
1) Love who you drafted for Miami. I love the Parsons pick because I feel the drop from him to the next LB is bigger than the drop from the top edge (Rousseau on most boards) to the next imo. I also love getting as many weapons for Tua as we can. Not sure I love a S at the top of the 2nd round as I think we have bigger needs. I would have gone RB/Edge in the 2nd in either order depending on if Etienne/Harris are available at 35, and if not targeting Chubba at 49. Then in the 5th I’d go BPA DB. Otherwise, great job lol
2) I don’t see 3 TE’s going round 1. I’m not sure I see NE taking a TE that high with how many holes they have. I know you haven’t mocked any new trades (or at least I didn’t pick up on them), but if they are at 9, I can see them trying to trade up for one of the big 3 QB’s or trading down and taking Trask/Wilson late 1st to get that 5th year. I definitely think JAX could take one to give there new QB another weapon and think this is Pitts ceiling (I’m someone who doesn’t think TE’s should go that high, like RB’s, unless they are game changing and “complete.” I see Pitts as a WR who plays close to the line and burns LB/bullies Safeties. I don’t see him as a good enough blocker to push him higher up the board for me). NO is a wildcard to me. They have to think about a Brees replacement and if it’s not Hill/Winston, maybe they draft Trask/Wilson. If they think they can squeeze one more Super Bowl run out of Brees, BPA and maybe a TE fits that to give Brees a safety blanket over the middle.
3) Last but not least lol. Have you seen any tape of Marlon Williams WR from UCF? He is leading the nation in receiving right now and I’m always surprised when I don’t see his name in a 7 round mock (not taking a shot at you lol I don’t think I could do a mock draft more than 2.5 rounds with it turning into guessing and as you can probably tell from this long response, I don’t like to do things half-assed). I’m a UCF fan so I’m probably biased, and I know there are tons of great WR’s this year, but I’d be surprised if he wasn’t drafted at all. He feels like Gabe Davis to me (again homer bias lol) where he could be a late round steal for a team and be a solid rookie WR and develop into a WR2 early in his career.

Sorry for the long response lol"
7242,2020-11-04 18:18:05,jnxtvb,"Anyone else not super high about Trey Lance? In my opinion, he really would’ve benefited from another year in school and I think he might not even be a first rounder right now."
7243,2020-11-04 22:07:11,jnxtvb,"If Daniel Jones keeps throwing picks, don't be surprised if the giants reboot with a QB."
7244,2020-11-04 22:14:06,jnxtvb,"Not big on New Orleans taking a TE in the first unless maybe it's Pitts/Freiermuth. We just invested in Trautman, who isn't a bona fide stud or anything, but TE isn't a need beyond depth. I'd probably like Jaycee Horn there, or Moore, but I think any offensive position other than WR/QB needs to be an exceptional case for us that early in the draft. Wilson or Twyman in the second would be other cool picks that were available, but LB makes sense."
7245,2020-11-04 16:05:36,jnxtvb,If Rondale Moore is available when GB picks and they instead take defense my head will explode
7246,2020-11-04 14:56:03,jnxtvb,I just have two questions: 1) Why do you have Pitts over Friermuth and 2) Do you think Zach Wilson and Kyle Trask are going to stay out of the first round by the time the draft comes along or do you see them rising to the first round?
7247,2020-11-04 17:13:52,jnxtvb,Jay Tufele is a Mike Mayock guy if I’ve ever seen one. Love it
7248,2020-11-04 18:24:43,jnxtvb,Hmmm value seems a bit off for the Cardinals. I like Etienne but I don’t think we are at a point where we can take a running back in the first especially considering our run game is already one of the best in the league. I also don’t believe edge is that much of a need especially if we resign Hassan Reddick. Anyway great effort with the 7 rounder +1

7251,2020-11-04 15:24:10,jnxtvb,I love how you have us going hard for edge defender since we only have one guy on contract (Fergunsun) beyond this year.  My only question is Ardaious a free safety?
7252,2020-11-04 15:44:07,jnxtvb,I think the jets have 3 5th rounders
7253,2020-11-04 16:07:18,jnxtvb,"Idk how to feel about us going RB in the first. I totally understand the logistics behind it(Drake on a one year deal this year and Chase is nearly FA too), but I’m not sure about using a first round pick on one. I do love Etienne as both a fit and a prospect though.

Other than that I think this is a solid draft for us, our biggest needs heading into next year imo are CBs and Edge and you have us filling those spots in the second and third."
7254,2020-11-04 16:22:15,jnxtvb,Woah did Justyn Ross fall off that hard? 4th round??
7255,2020-11-04 16:27:08,jnxtvb,"I don't think AZ values RB like that, plus they love Chase Edmonds. CB/DE/DL/WR/RB/TE imo. I think Campbell goes top 15 so if not him then Roche would be perfect there. I don't know enough prospects to evaluate the rest but you hit the needs."
7256,2020-11-04 16:34:46,jnxtvb,Chargers need linemen but 4 is a lot. May need a LB/CB/S/DT/P instead in one of those spots
7257,2020-11-04 17:10:45,jnxtvb,"I appreciate the work OP, but going RB(regardless of who it is) over Jaycee Horn is just....no, hell no."
7258,2020-11-04 17:19:14,jnxtvb,Overall I like it for the Bengals but my biggest complaint is waiting until Day 3 to address the offensive line. I'd rather we trae back in round 1 to grab one of the tier 2 OTs behind Sewell. Maybe gain some capital to look at a late round speed receiver.
7259,2020-11-04 17:20:58,jnxtvb,"I’m really interested to see where Justyn Ross ends up, and you’ve got him in the mid-4th. He’s top 5 talent, but there’s a good chance he never plays again, so I wonder how high someone reaches. If he gets healthy and ends up with the Chargers like you mocked, that offense would be so deadly."
7260,2020-11-04 17:34:47,jnxtvb,And I see Eichenburg is making a climb up your board ? A couple weeks ago you said 5th round for him
7261,2020-11-04 18:23:37,jnxtvb,"I would rather see Carolina pick Dylan Moses, Wyatt Davis, Kyle Pitts or Dillon Radunz in the first round over Farley. I would prioritize Moses or Davis over the others, depending on how Moses plays after his injury. I think the draft is a lot deeper at CB than at MLB and Tahir Whitehead has played atrociously this year."
7262,2020-11-04 18:49:25,jnxtvb,"Carlos Basham is a terrible fit for the Cardinals. EDGE players in our system have to be able to drop into coverage, and Basham isn't going to be doing that at his listed 285 lbs."
7263,2020-11-04 18:57:42,jnxtvb,We can’t wait to get a LB until the 4th round. We have to do it in the first or second. We have the worst corps in the league.
7264,2020-11-04 19:00:09,jnxtvb,"Waddle is nice, but John Ross memories kicking in *shudders*

I really like Ossai."
7265,2020-11-04 20:18:59,jnxtvb,"is Kyle Pitts really a ""star"" tight end? I feel like since Gronk/Hernadez everyone has been trying to find the next Gronk, whether it be Jake Butt, TJ Hockenson, Eric Ebron, etc. yet they never come even close, the great tight ends we see now have all flown under the radar (Kittle, Waller)."
7266,2020-11-04 21:41:48,jnxtvb,"i like this for the dolphins, its all there really

parsons is not my favorite pick, but you cant really not take him and we need a linebacker

i dont know anything about bateman, obviously i hope to get one of the top 3 wr guys somehow

a safety, some pass rush, offensive line

special thanks for not mocking us a running back early, literally every mock i see has us spending at least a 2nd rounder on a rb

not worth it in our current situation"
7267,2020-11-04 22:00:06,jnxtvb,Browns getting 2 LBs seems out of character. Swapping 1 with an IDL would be best IMO
7268,2020-11-04 22:36:17,jnxtvb,"Love this chargers draft completely, such a beautiful start to it. Im fairly sure the pick we got from the desmond king trade was the formerly jacksonville pick rather than the titans pick, but otherwise, Surtain and Carmen as our first 2 picks would absolutely be brilliant"
7269,2020-11-08 15:29:04,jnxtvb,"ILB to the Jets is a stupid draft pick, especially with CB's and IOL available."
7270,2020-11-08 22:21:54,jnxtvb,"I feel like this draft doesn't do enough for the jags biggest weakness, their awful dline. I'm not sure if you expect Caldwell to still be drafting but the guy has a tendency to draft heavy on dline, florida schools, and sec schools. Also we have had draft after draft with tight end as a weakness and we never make a serious attempt at fixing it through the draft, so i doubt we spent serious draft capital on the position"
7271,2020-11-04 21:12:56,jnxtvb,cant take any of these seriously if they don't have Cincinnati taking a tackle or guard in the first two rounds
7272,2020-11-04 18:14:28,jnxtvb,why cosmi over leatherwood?
7273,2020-11-04 18:30:34,jnxtvb,"Denver isn’t going CB in the 1st, stop copying other mocks"
7274,2020-11-04 15:14:24,jnxtvb,Starting to think The Jets trade down. They need so much help. Being an Eagles fan they never stand pat. I would expect to see movement from them.
7275,2020-11-04 15:55:16,jnxtvb,"Thank you! I'm also excited to see how things shift each week.

I just like Humphrey over Davis in general. Preference. They're not too far from each other in terms of talent though.

I think Wilson and Trask are 2nd round prospect but the way the picks fell, they landed in the 3rd round.

Hamsah is an absolute steal, he has 1st round talent but his stock has fell so he could very well fall in your lap.

I just go by whatever Tankathon says so it's all about what they have as their order.

I like this OL class and it's SUPER deep. I have the Bengals going home with 3 OL in this mock and they're all in the mid-later rounds. They can get productive guys later on in the draft.

Etienne can function as a receiving back and that's really intriguing to me. I'm not sold on Edmonds either and Drake might not be back so Etienne could potentially make more sense come April."
7276,2020-11-04 15:49:31,jnxtvb,"As a Falcons fan, I would be furious if we took any CB early. We should go for one of the top 3 QBs, let them sit behind Ryan for a year, and then plug them in in year 2. This sub hates Lance so much."
7277,2020-11-04 21:22:07,jnxtvb,BoB is the GOAT
7278,2020-11-04 16:51:47,jnxtvb,They need a RB and a WR. Fournette and McCoy are most likely gone after this year. Jones has improved but the team could go for an RBC to improve the ground game. Chris Godwin is headed to free agency and he could be asking for too much and the Bucs might not want to pay it.
7279,2020-11-04 18:03:21,jnxtvb,"Maybe WR in the 2nd and that's a big maybe (only to replenish the stock) definitely can't see RB until 3rd or later. I feel we will be targeting another OL prospect to start working on our LT depth for when smith is let go or walks etc.. Then Dline for Suh replacement to work with Vea as well as Barretts potential FA walk since he may desire more then we can afford if we lock up godwin, gronk, and maybe Antonio brown (big IF there as well considering suspension potential from Goodell)"
7280,2020-11-04 22:06:46,jnxtvb,100% we have way too many needs to get guys at non premium positions in day 2. I would go iOL over iLB any day of the week
7281,2020-11-04 17:51:36,jnxtvb,"If you can get a good LB, you take him. That's what I think."
7282,2020-11-04 15:56:13,jnxtvb,"Pittman and Brown would be an amazing duo and I just realized both of them went to USC which is interesting. It could erase the need for Hilton and if he regresses, you can trade him away."
7283,2020-11-04 17:31:57,jnxtvb,"I agree, his stock is going to soar as the season goes"
7284,2020-11-04 17:23:35,jnxtvb,"Yes, very sick haha. If you read my responses to the other people who said it, you'll know why I chose Etienne. But thank you!"
7285,2020-11-04 20:08:28,jnxtvb,I think you should stick with Jimmy for one more year at least
7286,2020-11-04 16:27:00,jnxtvb,"Thank you! In my opinion, they need to add a premier pass rusher like Rousseau and bolster the pass rush, even though they have Lawrence and Smith and Gregory. Rousseau is raw but he has lots of upside. Surtain is possible too."
7287,2020-11-04 17:59:36,jnxtvb,"I would argue that S is a need for Miami and considering Ford has the talent of a 1st-rounder, it would be a very good pick. I don't think RB is a huge need for Miami. They can get someone later in the draft without wasting a high pick.

Patriots need a TE bad. The two the drafted are not going to make a huge impact IMO and anyway, Pitts is just a tall WR. He's a TE just by name. I don't think they need to draft a QB this year either. I say ride another year with Newton or sign a different QB.

Saints do need to address QB but I didn't think they should go for a QB in the 1st and I liked Jabril Cox in the 2nd. If Trask or Wilson is available in the 3rd when they pick, they should totally go for them. I have been mocking TEs to them in the 1st usually though.

I've heard people talking about Marlon Williams and I know he's leading the nation. He's not the best route runner and he's not that quick. He's being compared to Anquan Boldin which makes sense, but as of now, I don't see him getting drafted. It could change soon though if he stays consistent this season.

I appreciate long feedback like this so thank you."
7288,2020-11-04 18:19:49,jnxtvb,"This sub hates on Lance way too much. From what I saw last year, he's a great prospect"
7289,2020-11-04 22:36:45,jnxtvb,It's possible
7290,2020-11-04 22:36:18,jnxtvb,"TE is a need because Cook is not the long-term option (might be gone next year), Josh Hill isn't anything special, and Trautman hasn't proven himself."
7291,2020-11-04 16:28:11,jnxtvb,I think this sub is sort of overrating Moore right now. I was higher on him pre-season but right now I'm a little lower.
7292,2020-11-04 17:23:01,jnxtvb,"Pitts is just a better prospect and receiver. I see Wilson and Trask rising and I even have them as Round 2 guys but the way the picks fell here, they went in the 3rd."
7293,2020-11-04 17:24:09,jnxtvb,Thank you
7294,2020-11-04 18:59:14,jnxtvb,"Even if we do resign Reddick, Chandler will be 31 going into the last year of his deal coming off a injury. We most certainly need EDGE."
7295,2020-11-04 18:26:44,jnxtvb,Thanks but I'm a little tired of answering this question repeatedly. Look at my responses to the other people who asked if you want to know why I chose Etienne. Cheers!
7296,2020-11-04 21:13:50,jnxtvb,"The big board I used had Wohlabaugh as a prospect. And nope, no Rumph.

I also think Surratt might go higher."
7297,2020-11-05 18:13:33,jnxtvb,Glad you liked it. Thanks!
7298,2020-11-04 15:50:59,jnxtvb,That's funny...I can't find a single website saying whether he's a FS or SS. Strange.
7299,2020-11-04 16:17:40,jnxtvb,"I believe TCU play a cover 2 scheme without a designated free/strong safety, but in the NFL Washington will probably be limited to FS and maybe sCB because of size concerns (5'8"" 180lbs)"
7300,2020-11-04 15:51:06,jnxtvb,How?
7301,2020-11-04 16:27:38,jnxtvb,Thanks. Etienne is basically a really good receiving back so it's just another pass-catching weapon for Murray and a force in the backfield.
7302,2020-11-04 16:25:42,jnxtvb,"Yeah, he suffered a spinal injury"
7303,2020-11-04 16:29:52,jnxtvb,"Thanks, I like Etienne because he's a pass-catching back and it would help Murray a lot more, even with Hopkins and Kirk already there at WR.  I think Roche and Campbell are going to go in the 25-35 range though."
7304,2020-11-04 16:52:28,jnxtvb,I'm not doing punters or kickers but I think the Chargers really need to do whatever they can to get this OL fixed
7305,2020-11-04 17:24:00,jnxtvb,Thank you
7306,2020-11-04 17:24:41,jnxtvb,I'm not doing trades so they had to stay put and take Waddle
7307,2020-11-04 17:25:11,jnxtvb,"Just imagine a triple threat of Ross, Allen, and Williams. Herbert would be set for years."
7308,2020-11-04 17:51:06,jnxtvb,Opinions change. Stocks rise. I though Jones was a 7th rounder a couple weeks ago too.
7309,2020-11-04 18:25:57,jnxtvb,"They don't need a TE or IOL that early right now. Corner is one of their bigger needs and so is LB, but Farley is the better overall prospect."
7310,2020-11-04 19:01:14,jnxtvb,"Actually looking through it again, I'd rather have Wyatt Davis by far."
7311,2020-11-04 19:35:29,jnxtvb,"Yeah, Waddle would really help Burrow though...definitely more than Ross"
7312,2020-11-04 20:22:39,jnxtvb,"Nobody thinks Pitts is the next Gronk. That's supposed to be Freiermuth, his nickname is ""Baby Gronk"". Pitts is pretty much a TE by name, but really a tall WR."
7313,2020-11-04 21:48:15,jnxtvb,"Obviously you guys should target the top 3 WRs but Bateman is an awesome consolation prize. And no problem, I know RB isn't that huge of a need for you guys. You have Breida, Howard, Gaskin, Washington, etc."
7314,2020-11-04 22:36:36,jnxtvb,"Their LB corps is pretty horrible, they need two LBs"
7315,2020-11-05 15:05:17,jnxtvb,Don’t they have a pretty good IDL in Sheldon Richards?
7316,2020-11-04 22:37:43,jnxtvb,Draft order is based on whatever Tankathon says but thank you for the praise.
7317,2020-11-04 23:37:01,jnxtvb,"Agreed. This might be the best mock I have seen for the Chargers so far. Hitting big on a CB like Surtain early is huge, and I really like the idea of going after multiple offensive linemen, especially with some pending free agents and Pouncey potentially retiring. 

Also, the pick from the Desmond King trade was confirmed to the Jaguars' 6th round pick."
7318,2020-11-04 21:13:55,jnxtvb,That's too bad
7319,2020-11-04 18:19:22,jnxtvb,Because I have him higher on the board
7320,2020-11-04 19:33:02,jnxtvb,"You don't know that, and Denver most certainly should be going CB or LB early."
7321,2020-11-04 19:34:25,jnxtvb,"""Copying other mocks"" I have had Denver picking a CB in 8/9 of the Weekly Mock Drafts I've posted. Get a grip."
7322,2020-11-04 15:20:40,jnxtvb,"They have a lot of extra picks In the next two years thanks to the Adams trade where they can add a lot of help for TL.

If anything, they should take advantage of trading back on the Sea 1st (which will be late and teams sometimes want to jump up into the first) or pick 33 (the first pick on day two) to get some more picks."
7323,2020-11-04 15:51:30,jnxtvb,"If the Jets have a chance at a generational QB, they gotta take him. This mock also doesn't have trades."
7324,2020-11-05 07:17:44,jnxtvb,"If the draft turned out this way, I would sacrifice my left but to make it happen. Love this."
7325,2020-11-04 15:55:29,jnxtvb,"I don't hate him, I just think that with the salary cap hell they're about to be in, they need to fill as many holes as possible via the draft, and a QB who isn't going to play doesn't do that.  If Lance is there, and another team wants him, I'd rather they trade down and get more picks."
7326,2020-11-04 16:52:58,jnxtvb,"I could see a situation where we go RB in round 2, but there’s is absolutely no way Godwin walks. He’d get the tag first."
7327,2020-11-04 19:57:49,jnxtvb,Hilton is a FA and I doubt we bring him back. Love Amon-Ra
7328,2020-11-04 20:09:58,jnxtvb,"Oh we will, we gotta have time for Wilson to get up to speed. But using a limited playbook because there is no deep ball is detrimental to the long term. Also 27 mil next year with only a 2mil cap penalty to move on might make that a no go for SF. 

I'm good with sitting a QB for a year to learn."
7329,2020-11-04 16:39:17,jnxtvb,"Respectable opinion. 

However next season Dallas has expiring contracts of Chidobe Awuzie, Jourdan Lewis , CJ Goodwin . Leaving them with Trevon Diggs , and Anthony Brown . 

While Dallas likely brings back one of the 3 (IMO it'll be Awuzie) 

Diggs, brown , Awuzie 

Is less desirable then the trio of 

Dlaw, A. Smith , Gregory"
7330,2020-11-04 21:49:51,jnxtvb,Surtain is personally my pick there as well. As bad as our pass rush has been this season I think we have way more pressing issues in the secondary. If there was a good interior DL or Parsons at 5 I would rather get those guys but I suspect one will be gone and the other doesn’t exist.
7331,2020-11-04 18:28:39,jnxtvb,"I also don’t think RB is a huge need for Miami, but I think getting a solid RB will help Tua a lot. I know Gaskins has played well this season, and we have a couple other guys on the roster who aren’t bad; but I don’t see a game changer there right now. I think a two headed monster of Harris and Gaskins would help Tua out almost more than a WR in round 1. I’m not against a WR in round 1, I like it. I just want as many weapons for Tua as possible. And I agree they can get a RB later, but I think it’s easier for a veteran QB to make a 6th round RB look like a 1st round RB than it is for a QB in what will be his 2nd year.

I’m not against the Ford pick. I think you’re absolutely right if he is a first round talent it would be a good pick. I just see things like OL, Edge, LB and a weapon or two for Tua as bigger needs than S atm.

And I agree with your Williams take. I know he’s not the biggest or the fastest so that will lower his ceiling, but I think he’s got great hands. The route running is one thing I’m conflicted on. I think part of the reason people don’t see him as a great route runner is because he runs a limited route tree (like the concerns with Metcalf coming out of Ole Miss), but it could be he runs a limited tree is because he’s a terrible route runner lol. I do think that’s something he’ll have to work on early in his NFL career.

I agree with your TE takes as well. It’s just hard for me to see that many going that early lol. NE is not typically one to trade up or take a QB early outside of the Jimmy G pick, but I don’t think the Newton experience is working right now. Maybe another season with a real offseason and Belichik can ‘unlock’ him. Stidham is also in year 2 so they still have time to see if he can be their next franchise QB. And as I said NO is hard to get a read on. They’ll have to look to the future soon, but until Brees is gone, they will be in win now mode."
7332,2020-11-04 18:21:03,jnxtvb,"Admittedly, I haven’t watched a ton of film, but what I did see didn’t scream top 10. I could see a team taking a flyer on the athletic ability though."
7333,2020-11-04 19:25:57,jnxtvb,"I don’t mind Trey Lance in the first round, but just personally, I don’t like any of the QBs besides Lawrence and Fields in the top 10.

As a Falcons fan, I think I’d be a little upset about us taking a QB in the first unless it’s one of those two. I would rather take one of the top CBs if we can’t get Rousseau.

I really liked the rest of your draft for the Falcons though. Kwity Paye in the 2nd sounds perfect and I like the value of Kylie Hill in the 4th too."
7334,2020-11-05 01:26:23,jnxtvb,"I mean, it's not *not* a need is how I would put it, in my own view. Not how I would want to invest a first round pick right now, unless you think Brevin is a huge stud, but I understand. Nice work and effort of course"
7335,2020-11-04 19:14:06,jnxtvb,"Yeah but is it really a big enough need to warrant a second round pick ahead of tight end, IOL, and most importantly cornerback? Chandler is getting older I’d admit but hes not going to fall off a cliff just because he over 30"
7336,2020-11-04 16:26:48,jnxtvb,"Good we need an FS and a dedicated slot guy (although Marlon plays well in the slot), because we don’t really have an actual FS on the roster and we have a dedicated slot CB, but he’s always hurt (Tavon Young)."
7337,2020-11-04 15:52:12,jnxtvb,Oops downvote me please.  5th round from the steelers is for 2022
7338,2020-11-05 23:41:33,jnxtvb,"I graduated with him in high school and went to school with him since 8th grade, I’m sad to see that happen to him man."
7339,2020-11-04 16:55:28,jnxtvb,I agree but we need some depth in other places as well
7340,2020-11-04 17:50:53,jnxtvb,"And if somehow one of them doesn’t get open, Herbert can just dump it off to Ekeler. Not a bad option either."
7341,2020-11-04 19:43:31,jnxtvb,I don't think the Bengals should spend an early pick on the interior line. They can wait a couple rounds because this IOL class is DEEP.
7342,2020-11-04 20:27:47,jnxtvb,So is he more a Hernandez/Jimmy Graham type? Who would be his pro comp?
7343,2020-11-05 00:06:25,jnxtvb,"Yeah, the corp is horrible because that's how it's designed. We're rotating out the role to who best fits that play. Drafting 2 goes antithesis with their philosophy UNLESS one of them is a LB/S hybrid."
7344,2020-11-05 15:16:09,jnxtvb,That's a weird question to answer. Is he good? Yes. Is he as good as his contract? No. He also has a tendency to run out of gas rather quick so the majority of beat writers are of the belief we dump him somehow. The big thing is Ogunjobi is probably gone.
7345,2020-11-04 18:36:13,jnxtvb,"ik but why? I’ve watched a little of both but from what I’ve seen, leatherwood is significantly more talented than cosmi, especially this year."
7346,2020-11-04 19:35:31,jnxtvb,"Sure, I don't know that.  We also don't know that The Chiefs won't pick a QB in the first round but we can use our context clues."
7347,2020-11-04 19:39:46,jnxtvb,"""I saw one guy mock them a CB and haven't changed my mind since""

oh ok"
7348,2020-11-04 17:14:34,jnxtvb,Can you imagine jets fans if they traded out of the sunshine pick lmao
7349,2020-11-05 11:00:01,jnxtvb,Thanks!
7350,2020-11-04 15:57:15,jnxtvb,"I mean, I wouldn't be fond of it but maybe we trade Ryan for a good enough offer. I love Matt and don't want it t happen but if a team offers a good haul, we should do it."
7351,2020-11-04 17:21:02,jnxtvb,"After the performance against the Giants, Godwin definitely looks like the priority to resign/tag."
7352,2020-11-05 14:59:08,jnxtvb,Bucs in win now mode this year and next so they will absolutely tag him.
7353,2020-11-04 17:16:07,jnxtvb,"How do you guys feel about Diggs?  He's been beat a lot this year, I know.  2 picks (1 was called back, IIRC) against PHI, although those seemed more like poor throws by Wentz than great plays by Diggs to me.  So does he remind you of a young Brandon Carr, or is there optimism he can prevent the big plays he's giving up rn?"
7354,2020-11-04 22:37:10,jnxtvb,I'm just not a fan of taking a CB early this year
7355,2020-11-04 19:42:46,jnxtvb,"Yeah, that's why I gave the Master Teague in this mock, a late-round RB could help.

I think one reason Williams isn't getting much hype though is because he plays at UCF. I think he would get more recognition at a bigger school.

I think we're all overreacting a little to Newton's troubles. Give him a few more games and then we can reach a verdict."
7356,2020-11-04 18:21:42,jnxtvb,I would recommend watching more tape then
7357,2020-11-04 19:37:47,jnxtvb,"I'm a Falcons fan too and although I really want Fields, I'd be content with Lance. I don't want an early CB and I think Rousseau is a nice consolation prize if we miss out on the top 3 QBs. Thanks!"
7358,2020-11-04 20:02:01,jnxtvb,"1. Hopefully we’ll go CB in the 1st so we won’t have to worry about that.

2. TE isn’t a vast need in this offense. 

3. IOL is the only one you can argue despite the IOL has held up for us this season.


You can never have enough pass-rush at all."
7359,2020-11-04 17:17:52,jnxtvb,"I love Washington, he seems like the best cover safety in the whole class to me; size might be a concern, but he likely fits into the Lamarcus Joyner role at the next level.  FWIW, PFF has him as a 1st rounder and the top safety in the class."
7360,2020-11-04 15:56:27,jnxtvb,Haha it's fine we all make mistakes
7361,2020-11-06 00:33:52,jnxtvb,I think he'll be back strong
7362,2020-11-04 17:51:50,jnxtvb,The possibilities are endless
7363,2020-11-04 20:29:12,jnxtvb,He's been compared to Waller
7364,2020-11-07 19:17:21,jnxtvb,">  The big thing is Ogunjobi is probably gone.

Which sucks because he leaned up a bit this year and he still has yet to have a big an impact as we've been expecting him to have. I don't know what's holding him up but he's just not being as disruptive as we'd like him to be. 

We for sure need to address LB, Edge, and IDL in the top three rounds of the draft though. I'm not entirely sure why safety is still looked at as a major need, Delpit should come back next year and Ronnie Harrison is proving to be a steal for us, we just need to get him to catch more of what he gets two hands on, but he's been great."
7365,2020-11-04 19:34:47,jnxtvb,"It's just personal preference, I think Cosmi is more talented and has more potential"
7366,2020-11-04 19:45:26,jnxtvb,"Sure, we don't know. Maybe Mahomes gets bored of football so the Chiefs have to take a QB. But what is more likely? The Chiefs having to find a new starting QB or the Broncos drafting a CB? I think it's very obvious which one."
7367,2020-11-04 19:47:28,jnxtvb,"Do you mind pointing out which mock I copied? Obviously, you know so much more about me than I do!"
7368,2020-11-04 17:24:19,jnxtvb,Jets fans would riot!
7369,2020-11-04 18:30:01,jnxtvb,I'd love Surtain ride with Matt for another year and maybe think of Zack Wilson or Mac Jones in the 2nd/ 3rd and let them sit 1-2 years behind Ryan.
7370,2020-11-04 17:04:56,jnxtvb,Nobody is trading for a 37 year old QB on a 40m a year deal though. Atlanta would have to throw in a pick with Ryan for a team to take on his contract
7371,2020-11-04 17:22:23,jnxtvb,"Especially with Brady going to be (most likely) back, it’s win now time. I don’t see them giving up weapons."
7372,2020-11-04 17:28:06,jnxtvb,"Wait, are you being sarcastic? He didn't play against the Giants..."
7373,2020-11-04 17:25:58,jnxtvb,"He's playing like a rookie would IMO... very inconsistent. Lots of those plays it looks like he's beat on he hasn't been , it's been miscommunication in coverage(because like you've heard players even say it's too much overload) Diggs on the year has given up 2 TDs and 446 allowing a 53% completion percentage ... he's also 4th in the league in PBU. He's had bad moments for sure , but this is a rookie starting with a unconventional offseason , and no preseason games he's shown a lot of good . He's probably been the best rookie outside maybe Jaylon Johnson out this rookie class out the corner postion ,nobodies played off the charts at corner out this class not because lack of talent but the weird circumstances. 

It's also worth noting Diggs often is shadowing teams #1 WR , to only give up 2 TDs , and be 4th in PBU after following around guys like Julio , Terry , Metcalf , etc ontop of being the 2nd most targeted player in league ! That is pretty impressive itself in normal circumstances

Al"
7374,2020-11-04 17:27:18,jnxtvb,I think we need to see how he is for the entire season before we judge
7375,2020-11-04 19:52:36,jnxtvb,"Yeah I sadly have to agree with that. It has gotten better for Non-P5 players, but there is still the stigma of “big numbers against inferior competition.”

And you’re right. We have only played half a season, so there’s still plenty of time for Newton and Belichik to turn it around. Worst case scenario for NE, they take a QB early day 2 to sit and develop behind Newton, and best case scenario, they draft one late day 3 or not at all.

Once again, great work on this."
7376,2020-11-04 16:02:32,jnxtvb,"As a Jets fan I really like the draft but don't feel like we can address the holes on both sides of the ball in one offseason,  if we're going with Lawrence I'd rather draft Meyers and Moore over a CB at the end of the first even with our holes at CB,   maybe its bit unrealistic I just want Lawrence to get more protection."
7377,2020-11-04 20:30:06,jnxtvb,Is he really a top 10 guy though? Esp over Waddle/Smith?
7378,2020-11-07 21:21:00,jnxtvb,"Well we run a 3 S defensive base and you mentioned 2 safeties. We'll need a third, and probably draft depth at DB in general. As far as DL go, fully agree, but I really don't think we draft LB high. Maybe the second 3rd we have but I don't think we do until the 5th"
7379,2020-11-04 19:48:56,jnxtvb,"Yeah it’s more likely it still not very.  We have AJ Boyue who is 1CB and we just drafted a guy who is playing very well (can’t spell his name).  OLine, DLine, Safety, are much bigger names than a 3rd CB.  Shit we just released a Bausby who was playing well because our CB is so deep."
7380,2020-11-04 20:08:16,jnxtvb,BOTH OF THEM!
7381,2020-11-09 06:49:53,jnxtvb,Zach Wilson has been getting more and more hype lately. I think he's gonna be a first round pick
7382,2020-11-04 19:29:25,jnxtvb,I personally don't want to draft another CB early after how Oliver panned out and Terrell hasn't proven himself to be worth the reach yet
7383,2020-11-06 04:15:40,jnxtvb,"He’ll actually only be turning 36 in May. I think he still has a few years left in him and we’ve seen guys like Peyton, Brees, and Brady play into their 40s now. It’s not crazy to think you could get at least 2 or 3 solid years out of Ryan. 

That said, I think the only coach who would really be interested is Shanahan. Jimmy G is inconsistent at best and he’s perpetually injured. Obviously, we’ve seen Ryan thrive in Shanahan’s system. 

I’m not the most knowledgeable guy on how the NFL salary rules work, but maybe we could work out a QB swap plus some sort of pick compensation. Then Falcons draft their QB of the future and use Jimmy G as a gap stop."
7384,2020-11-04 21:17:39,jnxtvb,He'd only cost the new team about ~25MM per year with none of it guaranteed.  Falcons cap would be fucked next year if they deal him this offseason though.
7385,2020-11-04 17:57:19,jnxtvb,He meant with how the WR Corp performed without Chris Godwin in comparison to when he is active
7386,2020-11-04 19:53:05,jnxtvb,Thank you so much. I hope you tune in for the rest of the mocks.
7387,2020-11-04 16:28:41,jnxtvb,I can see that happening as well
7388,2020-11-07 21:34:38,jnxtvb,"How many safeties are we rostering with a 3S base defense? If we resign Joseph that would give us Delpit, Harrison, Joseph, Redwine, and Moffat (I'm assuming we let Sendejo walk). Would we want to roster six safeties or do we just cut or practice squad Moffat if we can land a good FA? 

I really think we need to address our abysmal LB core but you're right about our base defense being a 3S system. I hate to say it but I don't think we'd need to worry so much about LB had we drafted Chinn and of course Cincinnati swooped in and grabbed Logan Wilson right from us too."
7389,2020-11-04 19:51:33,jnxtvb,"Bouye is not the same All-Pro he was a few years ago. You're stuck in the past. Ojemudia is good but you do know teams are allowed to start more than once CB right? It's not illegal, don't worry, every team does it. Callahan is good too but they can still use another corner if a good enough one comes along."
7390,2020-11-04 22:50:20,jnxtvb,Denver only goes Oline if they don't resign Bolles. Safety maybe if we don't sign Simmons long term. And Wade is a great mid 1st pick. I liked him last year @10 before he decided to play another year (but not over Jeudy who not many thought would drop so far). Another do-it-all kind of db just like what Fangio loves. I didn't see a DL there that I would take and maybe you could jump the gun on MLB
7391,2020-11-04 20:10:31,jnxtvb,LMAO
7392,2020-11-04 19:31:54,jnxtvb,"Terrell is looking good and Cb is a prime position, you can't be scared to chase it just because you had some failures.

The modern NFL you can't survive without prime cbs, there is a reason why Belicheck pays Dbs only on his team."
7393,2020-11-04 18:00:00,jnxtvb,"Oh, I get it now. Thanks."
7394,2020-11-07 22:01:15,jnxtvb,"Well you listed 3 starters, 1 capable backup, and one practice squad depth guy. We'd need to have 1 FS, 1 SS, and 1 3rd S role (what that looks like is up in the air). So right now we only have 1 backup FS that you listed, and without the need to carry 5/6 LBs then those spots open to the secondary.

Personally I don't think we do much in FA unless we're talking more one year deals. That could be depth or could be key rotation like Billings was supposed to be.

Generally LBs are only as good as their DL, so improving at Edge and IDL would be huge.  Some writers thinks we target a hybrid role, like Peppers (but not literally Peppers), so LB becomes more of a specialty.

Overall I think we draft: 2 Edge, 3 DBs, 2 IDL, 1 TE"
7395,2020-11-04 19:38:45,jnxtvb,But look at the Vikings. They've been spending pick after pick on CB and none of them have really lived up. I don't want to try and hit on a CB in hopes of them being amazing right now. I'd rather us go QB.
7396,2020-11-07 22:21:45,jnxtvb,"So for this Hybrid role would you rather have Caden Sterns or Hamsah Nasirildeen. Just looking at Hamsah he seems like someone that would fit that role pretty well but, I don't know much of either one really."
7397,2020-11-05 12:20:10,jnxtvb,"To argue against this, Waynes and Alexander were great for what they were. Neither were elite top 5 guys, but they were a great 2 and 3 behind prime Rhodes. The only reason we didn't re-sign them is because of money. 

And Hughes has shown steady improvement when healthy. He missed his rookie year so this is really year 2 for him, but he's clearly our best guy and can make some good plays. He was clearly drafted so that we could let one of Rhodes/Waynes/Mack walk this year or next. 

Then you've got this year's class with Gladney, Dantzler, and Hand. All have shown steady improvement and are finally at the point we would've expected them to be had they had an actual preseason. They do get beat, but they're super physical and play with a great motor. 

Also, none of our CB picks have ever been one of the top CBs of the draft. I think this conversation might be different if we had gone Ramsey/Ward/Henderson. You're picking between Caleb Farley and Patrick Surtain, not between Israel Mukuamu and Tyson Campbell."
7398,2020-11-04 19:43:46,jnxtvb,"I think Zack Wilson in the second (Maybe late first to get that 5th year option) is a much better result especially  getting an impact player right away. 

I will jump on board with the QB pick if we do it but I don't like judging prospects by the last guys you picked.

Look at the Lions drafting Megatron after going WR constantly before. Don't let the past shape your feelings on current players (I Love Surtain)"
7399,2020-11-08 00:43:58,jnxtvb,"Haha that's the million dollar question. If we draft a FS, I love Cisco from Cuse, but as far as SS/Hybrid, I really like what Sterns brings, and I think he'll be there in the 3rd to provide extra value. I think our first two picks are Edge/IDL unless someone drops"
7400,2020-11-05 13:29:30,jnxtvb,I don't think Gladney and Dantzler have proven themselves yet so we'll need to see much more from them. I just don't see CB as a big need for the Vikings right now. They need to address the OL and DL and get a QB. S might be a need too.
7401,2020-11-04 19:46:56,jnxtvb,"By the way, I think Wilson is a 2nd round prospect right now but the way the picks fell, he landed in the 3rd.

It's just an opinion that I don't think Atlanta should draft a CB. Megatron was a much better prospect than Surtain is. Megatron was a can't-miss generational WR."
7402,2020-11-04 19:50:06,jnxtvb,"I agree I am just trying to say I don't like your argument of not taking a CB because we have failed there before. 

If you just don't like Surtain I am okay with that argument."
7403,2020-11-04 19:52:15,jnxtvb,"I like Surtain, I just like the three QBs better"
7404,2020-11-04 19:55:19,jnxtvb,"Perfect I can accept that answer, I like Surtain better than Lance and think with a year behind Matt Wilson can be a top tier QB with his natural ability."
7405,2020-11-04 19:56:51,jnxtvb,Lol you called him Matt Wilson...but imagine if there was a QB who was a mix of Matt and Wilson
7406,2020-11-04 19:58:24,jnxtvb,"I mean Zach Wilson sitting behind Matt Ryan but just came out bad typing lol. 

Zack Wilsons natural talent is mouth watering to me."

It was historical because Uzoh, a benchwarmer in the 2011-12 season, helped lead the Raptors to a victory that tied them with the Golden State Warriors for a 23-43 record. This meant that the Warriors would keep their draft pick if it were top 7, which they did. They used it to draft Harrison Barnes, who while not the star player the Ws needed to contend was nevertheless a good complementary piece, and was part of the 2015 championship team and was the linchpin of a trade to Dallas that opened up cap space for Kevin Durant in 2016."

Oscar, west, Havlicek, and a few other legends from the 60's that had the longevity played some of the same competition that bird and magic did.

Hell, Rick Barry (who was battling Wilt and Russ in the 60's) played in the same league as Larry Bird. How MJ, Larry, and Magic can be considered top 3 players by most fans while the previous players get laughed at and written off literally makes zero sense."

And those got little reaction when they should’ve been talked about and the girls should’ve received more respect from what they were made do."
7455,2020-12-15 08:56:29,kdh3k1,"It’s unfortunate that this is the most coverage they’ve had in America in years, however this is very typical of how American media works. If you (an actor/musician/ celebrity of any kind really) don’t offer these outlets exclusive interviews/pap pics/ love on social media then the won’t post about you unless it’s something like this. They also post about what people have fresh in their heads, which is why you’ll see articles all about contestants from the bachelor/ett shows or tik tokers because that’s stuff that people can’t shut up about even if it’s something stupid. The girls last promo trip the the US (which was LA and NYC for like 2 weeks) was during Glory Days. I love them but their team stopped trying to promote them in the US, which means outlets won’t talk about them unless it’s an article about a new single/album on billboard or something like this with jesy leaving"

7458,2020-12-20 18:36:35,kdh3k1,"I think it's because media likes them as individual people and as a group but they don't like their music. So their music doesn't get attention because they don't like their style. But then when it comes to something as big as one of them leaving, everyone cares."

7580,2020-12-14 13:00:39,kcwaaj,Damn. James Pattinson averages 22! His international average is about 27 iirc. He must averaged in late teens in FC cricket.
7581,2020-12-14 15:24:32,kcwaaj,Where is Jhye Richardson these days? Injured or something?
7582,2020-12-14 21:50:21,kcwaaj,No Dorff? Avg 23.85
7583,2020-12-15 04:20:39,kcwaaj,No everyone knows why picking 6 batsmen in form has been so hard in Australia the last 10 years.
7584,2020-12-14 15:44:53,kcwaaj,"Not quite but his FC average minus his Test career (avg 26.33 btw) is a still extraordinary 20.82.

Combine that with his FC strike rate which is among the greatest of all time (42.8). Better than Cummins, Starc, McGrath, Anderson, Hadlee, Ambrose, Donald, Imran Khan, Akram. 

In fact the only ones with a better FC strike rate are Waqar Younis (40.9) and Dale Steyn's incredible _Test_ SR (42.3). Edit: and Rabada's Test SR too is an amazing 40.6 while Shane Bond's short Test career unbelievably netted wickets every 38.7 balls.

I honestly believed coming through that Pattinson would be the best of the Australian fast bowling quartet, even better than Cummins. It's just a shame his body hasn't held together for much of his career so far."
7585,2020-12-14 15:27:36,kcwaaj,"Had a shoulder reconstruction in May, just returned in the BBL the other night. Fingers crossed he can stay fit and start bowling in the shield again after the Big Bash."
7586,2020-12-14 23:44:14,kcwaaj,"Hasn't played a FC game in over 2 years, so I left him off :(

Nathan Coulter-Nile is the same. I think both of them may have become white-ball only players due to their injuries, but if either of them play a FC game at some point they will go back on this list.

I know it's a bit arbitrary but I have to have some sort of cut-off otherwise guys from ages ago will fill up the list."
7587,2020-12-14 23:19:15,kcwaaj,Probably just a mistake
7588,2020-12-14 23:51:11,kcwaaj,Dorff still has a red ball contract unlike NCN though. But fair enough gotta have some sort of cut off.

The reason why it seems that A-bombs were 'a hoax' is mid to late cold war anti-nuclear histeria. Indeed, A bombs were more expensive and less efficient than the good old jerry can bombing that the US employed in Tokyo or other cities. The difference was that you could obtain a comparable effect of  a medium scale bombardment in a flash and only one ordinance. The concentrated forces also meant that shelters were less effective if hit directly. H-bombs were truely monstrous and with MIRVs the nuclear danger became even more monstrous.

And your ideea of redditor has nothing to do with Red China. Red China is the real china because the communists won their Civil War in 1947. Saying otherwise is like saying that the Confederates won the US civil war."

I'm also reminded of what I believe to have been predictive programming re: 9/11.  You'll probably recall one of the big heart-tugging songs afterwards was ""Where Were You When the World Stopped Turning?""  I say in the 70s there was a good deal of foreshadowing of the hoax, including E.L.O.'s song ""Last Train to London.""  I'm not aware of others pointing this one out, but the song has American sounding sirens throughout and begins:

""It was 9:29...9:29 back street big city

It was one of those nights...one of those nights when you feel the world stop turning...""

So we have a mirroring/twinning of the number which in either direction can make a 9+11 as well as other things."

I've been out for like  7/8 years and ill still catch myself doing shit occasionally like resting my shopping basket on my hip. I found packing helped a lot with the sitting thing, and also walking, since having something  there makes you more conscious of how you sit and walk."
7741,2020-12-14 02:20:28,kcisut,"Yeah, I get it.  I didn't hate my body much pre-transition either.  I used to think ""this is the wrong body, why was I born with a vagina, where's my dick?""  ""Why did I grow boobs instead of pecs?""  Things like that.

I've felt that way for longer than you've been alive (I'm 58.)  I always thought for most of my life I was the only person that felt that way.  I didn't think that I could change until I was 54.  

Now, I'm 4 years into my transition, and I still don't hate my body.  The things that are ""wrong"" I'm changing.  Its simply easier to live the rest of my life not needing to bind.  I *like* not needing to bind, but I never hated my chest pre-top.  I love the idea of standing to pee, but I don't hate my vagina, its simply not what I want.  So now I'm researching meta/scrotoplasty surgeons.  Its mentally easier for me to live the rest of my life looking like and feeling that I'm the correct gender, so I'm on HRT.  I love the changes I have so far, and am eager to see what else changes.  Second puberty is thrilling and a bit scary. Lol

Not everyone hates their body.  Some of us just want to fix our ""birth defects,"" either with surgery, HRT, socially, etc.  That's what I'm finally doing, fixing the physically wrong things on my body.

Congrats on being called the name you prefer!  And remember, not everyone hates their body, some of us are simply fixing it."
7742,2020-12-15 10:06:25,kcisut,"I never ""hated"" my body. I just felt very detached/puzzled by it. I'd be very good at pretending my breast tissue was pecs, or angling myself in the mirror so my hips weren't sticking out. I really tried to accentuate any positive masculine qualities to keep the dysphoria under control. Your individual coping style will have a great effect on how you experience dysphoria.

7747,2020-12-14 05:17:09,kcisut,This! This is exactly how I feel! Thank you! It means so much to hear someone else say they feel the same way. I’ve been feeling kind of like a fraud so it’s nice to know there are other people out there who are like me!
7748,2020-12-16 16:16:52,kcisut,"Sorry if I ask but I have mild dysphoria and sometimes I can't understand myself. I get the desire of changing, but how to know if the changes will be right?
For example, I have a quite low voice, very androgynous, and it's better than have an high voice, but how can I know if I want to go under T if I don't have crippling dysphoria?"
7749,2020-12-15 16:09:54,kcisut,"Ok, I always thought dysphoria meant hating your body. I’m learning new things!"

7754,2020-12-16 17:40:51,kcisut,"Before I transitioned, I was androgynous for most of my life, so for about 30 years. But it wasn't enough for me, and I couldn't figure out *why* it wasn't right.

I knew it was right for me the day my voice began to noticeably drop.  The day my (dirt) mustache and body hair began growing.  I knew I wanted masculine attributes because they just felt *right* once they began.

You don't need to be under ""crippling dysphoria"" in order to know that transitioning is right for you.  Sometimes, transitioning is more like an ""ahhhh, this feels right!"" kind of mood.  It was that way for me.

Besides, you can always stop taking T if doesn't feel right for you.  Be sure to research both permanent as well as reversible physical changes before starting T, just in case its not for you.

Edit: clarification and spelling."
7755,2020-12-16 17:49:09,kcisut,"Nope, like I'm sure you may have read by now, not everyone experiences crippling dysphoria.  

Some of us only feel a sense of ""wrongness"" with our bodies.  At least that's how it was for me, pre-T."
7756,2020-12-18 07:57:53,kcisut,"Yeah, I wanted something else to work for me, Luka, but it is Slavic and my surname is Germanic, and it just didn’t work.  I left it pretty quickly.  It is hard to name yourself; I don’t think non-trans people get that at all."

7760,2020-12-18 14:21:35,kcisut,Luka is awesome too! I grew up in Germany so I’ve always liked names like Luka. But in the US they’d be weird and I don’t want people mispronouncing/misspelling my name.

>What is it with people who start a sentence ‘Like!’ Or ‘I mean you know!’ It was like hard to read at times

The woman had spent days on the stand, not an elocution competition. And her testimony was transcribed verbatim. I do a lot of transcription for work and this is how everyone's transcribed speech reads like. I'm sure you sound this way too.

>Dani in that room actually made clear something I hadn’t realized — that she was actually free to leave I’d she just copped to her shit

Dani was undocumented while living in America. She was terrorized by Keith, as were all the women who were his victims. And she knew nobody outside of the cult could know about her status, because if they did, she'd be deported. And that's not even to mention that this was the equivalent of a psychological imprisonment. 

Just because she wasn't chained to the wall doesn't mean she could just ""walk out"" if she ""copped to her shit."" I'm honestly at a loss for what to say about your reaction."
7792,2020-12-14 01:52:58,kcict6,"That's the one l read too. When she had to read the DOS material outload and then explain the ""thinking"" behind what was written in the manuals and her relationships within the first line/second line dynamic and all the ""women are unreliable and taken care of and make excuses"" bullshit, l was ENRAGED and sad. Such misogynistic  manipulation at work. I realize we can't discern tone in a transcript but l can't imagine being in a court, reading that out loud and not feeling like a complete fool. These hardline NXers were completely dismantled."
7793,2020-12-27 22:43:01,kcict6,That's helpful! Now 2 fantastic events to await at the end of January!
7794,2021-01-23 18:25:44,kcict6,What made you think more transcripts were going to be available on the 21st?
7795,2021-01-23 18:13:40,kcict6,I purchased the testimony on the 30th but I didn’t buy any more days because I decided to wait until they released it. Aren’t they supposed to release it to the public like this week? I can’t wait to read Lauren’s cross. That’s the one thing I should have purchased but I was new to the process so I ended up with a different date. It appears to me one could easily rack up a huge PACER charge very easily without realizing it. It kinda scares me so I haven’t gotten back on there.

7804,2020-12-15 04:42:07,kcict6,Well if she claims innocence or blames it all on Keith then maybe she thinks it’s a good idea. We all know she’s lying though. This judge isn’t putting up with any b.s. so maybe she thinks she’s already lost?

7810,2020-12-14 00:05:06,kchhrj,"Perhaps when taking a poll in a private subreddit, you want to make it known you plan to share the information.

Edit: jk, OP didn’t even make the thread. So I’ll rephrase. Perhaps when you don’t take the names from a private subreddit and post them on a public one without the parents permission."
7811,2020-12-14 00:11:29,kchhrj,"Just echoing what some others have said, the reaction to this list being posted to r/namenerds has been pretty negative over in the October 2020 Baby Bump group. I know sharing names in a private subreddit doesn't mean it's really ""private,"" but it's still upsetting to people. I don't personally mind (I've got little Margot!) but I know r/namenerds has tried to be more sensitive about posting name lists."

Callahan James sounds awesome, like that kid should be famous with a name like that. I’m pleasantly surprised by how many people used Felix and Fiona. Both are great names that I don’t hear much where I live. Margot also seems to be making a comeback, and I think it’s so cute.

But the number one names? The twins with the middle names Artemis and Apollo. I genuinely love that."

7853,2020-12-13 22:04:58,kchhrj,In Icelandic it apparently means eclipse and there is an Icelandic musician named Myrkvi. Maybe it was inspired by him or they're really into astronomy?

7874,2021-01-01 21:08:25,kn4oox,"I guess now he’s collabed with infamous right wing radicalist, geeks and gamers, you’ll believe"
7875,2020-12-30 16:02:07,kn4oox,"T''his was because he included a sample of Imperial march in his product. At the time the film was not monetised but that doesn't mean it wasn't copyright infringement.''

lol, under lucas  there was a bloody award ceremonies for fanworks
and now years later we have people whinnying about muh copyright infringement.


starwars has always had strong fan works.
asking a company to remove the adds is completely fair.

-edit-
removing your post is a cowardly move."
7876,2020-12-30 15:59:40,kn4oox,"If you want real clickbait go to the channel of Mike Zeroh , ""OMG GOERGE LUCAS SAID SOMETHING ABOUT GROGU"""
7877,2020-12-30 15:58:07,kn4oox,"""Clickbait"" He never tried to confirm anytging lol this is just theory"
7878,2020-12-30 16:02:35,kn4oox,"Wow. This is such a bad take.

If you this is what you think going down a dark path is... maybe you need to watch the movies again."
7879,2021-01-03 01:25:21,kn4oox,"This is a guy who has dedicated his life to serve Star Wars content to fans. He has been bullied and ridiculed but has fought back. I can honestly say that I do not agree with every moral stance he has taken, but that is okay! I do not think he deserves posts like these. People criticise him for reading off the wiki and presenting the material «as his own». I cannot remember him ever claiming most of those theories as his own. Perhaps he should become better at crediting his source (s), but that’s about it for me. This guy lives and breathes Star Wars. Those tears are not fake. This is his big passion in life, and he has enjoyed the benefits of all his hard work. Theories is only a fraction of his content. The Vader series he is working on costs an insane amount of money and he doesn’t even attempt to monetize it because of his love and respect for the source material.

I honestly believe he should be given a cameo in upcoming Star Wars content. There sure is plenty to choose from, and he has become quite a prominent figure in the Star Wars community so I’m sure both himself and his almost 3 million subscribers would appreciate it - me included. 

I honestly do not see any difference between him reading Star Wars fan theories on his channel to Pewdiepie playing Dark Souls. Are you going to criticise Pewdiepie as well? After all, he didn’t make the game, write the story or voice the characters. While you’re at it, slam every streamer as well as gaming- and reactor youtube channels. They didn’t make shit."
7880,2020-12-30 15:56:40,kn4oox,What do you mean?
7881,2020-12-30 16:08:29,kn4oox,That is definitely one conclusion that’s heavily supported. Which I personally agree with
7882,2020-12-30 16:03:04,kn4oox,"I never said it was right just legal

Like I said this isn’t about my opinion"
7883,2020-12-30 20:24:13,kn4oox,"That’s what I’m saying he should have done but he didn’t, he asked them to rebuke the claim so he could monetise it"
7884,2020-12-30 20:24:28,kn4oox,I never removed my post....
7885,2020-12-30 15:58:52,kn4oox,Yeah which is made clear once you are 2 minutes in and having watched 2 ads
7886,2020-12-30 16:04:52,kn4oox,I was including a joke. I’ll remove it as my tone wasn’t clear
7887,2021-01-03 11:50:21,kn4oox,I didn’t say anything about him reading fan theories nor did I say he faked those tears. I’m saying that he’s in it for the money (which is fine but stop painting him as a saint) and that this is a giant publicity stunt. He went on Geeks and Gamers where some pretty horrible things were said. G+G is a disgraced YouTube’s who brings right wing ‘patriotism’ into everything. He makes videos daily where he pretends to be with the fans but actually twists it in into anti woman propaganda. Him attacking ‘SJW’ is done in a racist/sexist manner. His whole channel is based on faceless rumours often attacking Brie Larson and claiming she’s big LFL despite never being linked with them
7888,2020-12-30 15:59:09,kn4oox,"Posts just like this. If you really don't like something, leave it be."
7889,2020-12-30 16:03:52,kn4oox,it seems to be your opinion.
7890,2020-12-30 16:01:55,kn4oox,So you made a video about a theory that Windu saved Grogu how do you name the video ? He never said WINDU MANDALORIAN CONFIRMED
7891,2021-01-05 15:43:32,kn4oox,"Some of my statements were a general response to his haters and not directed all at you. I’ll definitely check out the G+G vid, haven’t seen it.

But yeah, of course he does it for the money. Show me one big youtuber who doesn’t do it for the money. It takes a lot of work to drop daily videos, but now he can make a living doing what he loves and he provides exciting content for almost 3 million subscribers. Win-win. I will, however, continue to give him credit for not attempting to monetise the Vader series. 

As I said, I don’t agree with everything he says or does, and I found the Brie Larson vids a bit strange. However, I agree with him on many levels when he has criticised the likes of Kathleen Kennedy and how they have handled the sequel trilogy. I guess it comes down to point of view in the end, but I don’t think he has an agenda towards the feminist movement, but rather women who takes it too far - which a lot of them do."
7892,2020-12-30 15:59:52,kn4oox,"Which is what I do, I haven’t watched a video of his in months before making this"
7893,2021-01-05 15:48:15,kn4oox,"Eckharts Ladder and Star Wars explained are two big names who don’t seem to care about money as much .

With the KK stuff it does worry what he blames her for - things that are the directors fault - and does make me worry about his political opinions.  Criticise her for lack of direction but apart from that there’s nothing to blame her for. People say she should interfere more in creative control but when that does happen (think x-men) everyone gets real angry"
7894,2021-01-03 01:26:11,kn4oox,Then why make this post? You literally just confirmed that he lives rent free in your head if you haven’t watched him in months but still felt the need to make this.
7895,2021-01-05 15:58:30,kn4oox,"I think she as the head of the corporation should have done her bit in ensuring better preparations for the sequel trilogy, because let’s be honest, they were a complete mess. 

I won’t criticise her too much, she has been part of many of my all-time favorite movies, but I think they all dropped the ball on the SW sequels. And she, of course, becomes the scapegoat since she is the boss and hired the directors as well as losing a bunch of them along the way. The Mandalorian shows their true potential when the right people for the job are hired. I hope Favreau and Filoni are part of every future Star Wars series/movies until the day they leave this planet.

Can you please dm me the original post since it was deleted? I’m intrigued."
7896,2021-01-03 11:43:43,kn4oox,This is in response to the Pablo Hidalgo controversy and the Internet suddenly deciding to back him. I’m trying to show why he’s wrong
7897,2021-01-05 16:07:27,kn4oox,"Yeah she definitely should have done more in regards to planning and overall direction 

What do you mean link to original post?"
7898,2021-01-05 16:13:29,kn4oox,It says «removed» at the top of this post. I was interested in having a closer look at what you originally posted.
7899,2021-01-05 16:16:32,kn4oox,"Why Star Wars Theory deserves the criticism he is getting

Star Wars Theory is a Canadian Star Wars Youtuber who created his channel back in 30th July 2016 and has since then made over 1800 videos registering 778 million views.

On the 22nd December 2018 he published  ""VADER EPISODE 1: SHARDS OF THE PAST - A STAR WARS THEORY FAN-FILM"" which has gained 22 million views and caused him to gain worldwide fame. He regularly creates Lore videos along with breakdowns of all the new Star Wars i.e Mandalorian and Clone Wars. He also has a podcast Rule of Two where he and the collider owner Marc Fernandez discuss all things Star Wars occasionally bringing on guests including Ashley Eckstien and Sam Witwer

Now onto why I dislike him (I will try to b e as objective as possible presenting only facts)

* Clickbait - Now there is nothing inherently wrong with Clickbait as long as you stay honest; a line which he crosses. His content consists a lot of theories but he titles the videos in a way that makes his theories seem like they are confirmed news. **Cal Kestis Saves Grogu in The Mandalorian Season 2 - Star Wars Theory**, **Anakin Saved Grogu During Order 66 - Star Wars Theory**,  **Mace Windu's Return in The Mandalorian Season 2 - Star Wars Theory.** Whilst the word Theory is present in these titles that is so when you search his channel name, these videos pop up. nowhere is it said that the yare unofficial or fan made etc. This is part of a larger problem on YouTube of putting a Channels name in your title to grab their viewers - he has 183 videos that do just that [Star Wars Theory's STAR WARS EXPLAINED playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyXNVJm4ZnaP7gdvNuQHYdkk35Bg_4ukH). Something that people like Mike Zeroh take to its absolute extremes, but it is nonetheless present here
* CANON - Now a lot of modern day Star Wars on YouTube revolves around the new canon, anything released post 2014 through the Lucasfilm Licensing Program. He used to make videos where it was implied they were canon (i.e he used pictures of them from canon but talked about Legends stuff) but that has stopped now. Something he still does however, during videos discussing things that are canon, which he very clearly made sure we knew that it was canon, he will commonly refer to a Legends idea/concept as the crux of his argument. For instance in a video about Grogu he said that it's Yoda and Yaddle's son as in Legends Ki-Adi mundi was able to breed in order to save his dying species. This was showcased on multiple occasions in the Star Wars Republic comic series that ran from 1998-2013 is some form or another
* Manipulation of viewers - This one cannot be supported by facts but merely context and observations. When SWT made his Vader Fanfilm, it was claimed under grounds of Copyright Infringement by Warner Tamerlane Publishing Corp who license the music for Star Wars. This was because he included a sample of Imperial march in his product. At the time the film was not monetised but that doesn't mean it wasn't copyright infringement. He started a campaign asking Disney to reverse their claim. He said he just wanted them to remove the adds - something they could still do whilst the video was claimed. After a 'public' outcry and borderline harassment to Disney but specifically certain employees (Kathleen Kennedy and the usual suspects, you know who I mean) and the twitter operators. In the end, presumably to avoid more drama they reversed the claim and apologised. Since then it has been more of the same: playing victim, urging people to fight his battles and by not discouraging and behaviour, indirectly endorsing it and after getting what he wants, defends himself again by saying he didn't want thus. As these keeps on happening it is hard to believe that he doesn't wish this as there are many things he could do stop this from becoming harassment and cyberbullying. There are many other examples of him clearly tricking his viewers that I could bring up but that is not what I am here for.

**Pablo Hidalgo Controversy** 

The grounds for this recent Pablo Hidalgo controversy is one tweet, out of context that cannot be viewed due to his account being private. Giving SWT the benefit of the doubt that he didn't realise it could actually mean anything, after having been criticised by many people (LFL and EA employees along with News Journalists, all who pointed this out) you'd think he would at least acknowledge his possible lapse in judgement, which he hasn't. Today he published another video on this issue where he, Marc Fernandez and DENOfNerds have brought it up again, stirred on more of the hate on, proving he will not back down. Why would he do this? Well controversy benefits the accuser most of the time no matter the argument and it's validity. Take Tatty who accused James Charles of being a Sexual Predator, claims which were all rebuked with strong evidence: She gained 5 million subscribers through this whilst James lost 3 million. This shows a motive to do what he is doing, one that isn't purely protecting his reputation. 

**Verdict**

Theory is someone who I used to respect but since his breakthrough has fallen down a dark path so to speak. I am not evaluating him as a human being but rather the content he puts out and the way he presents it. He has shown signs of exploitation of channels established reputation and fans along with seemingly intentionally causing headline seeking drama and controversy"
7900,2021-01-05 16:16:45,kn4oox,I guess the mods deleted it
7901,2021-01-05 16:30:07,kn4oox,"Thanks, very interesting read. I’ll not weigh in too much on everything you said, as I agree with some of it, but not everything. Bottom line, I think this is a guy who was bullied to the extremes while growing up and he now finds strength in numbers and seeks acknowledgement from said numbers, being his subscribers. I take his persistence on all of these controversies as a sign of a guy who has decided to never allow himself to be ridiculed again, but you can also flip the coin and argue that he exploits his position by doing this. So I completely get where you’re coming from. 

I watch his videos almost daily and enjoy most of his content. Even though a lot of his theory videos are based on stuff from legends, I personally feel thoroughly informed about when he is referencing canon material and when he is not. This guy will grow old having had a job in which he made a lot of money doing what he loved, so I am happy for him. Let’s just hope he avoids controversy from now on, because it doesn’t look too good in the long run. Perhaps I’ll retract my statement about Favreau/Filoni potentially putting him in one of their projects as he’s probably blacklisted by Lucasfilms by now."

7909,2020-12-31 00:24:53,kn4ohs,"Twitch is a great place for this imo. The best bi streamer out there is probably Eret who is a very likeable and accepting member of the community. He has a coming out counter for the people that h e come out on his streams, he often talks about lgbt related stuff and (seeing as you mentioned James Charles) was once on a dating show with him. But twitch isn’t everyone’s cup of tea but that’s just my recommendation for a good lgbt role model"

7940,2020-12-31 08:17:43,kmzqnd,Omg I've subscribed to your channel a long time ago and I've been watching your videos ever since! Your videos about Missing 411 are well made and thought through. Keep up the good work!
7941,2021-01-01 02:28:12,kmzqnd,"Very odd that the actual Paulides videos are not presented (allowed) here but all kinds of other info is allowed. 

I gather from listening to the 'real' Paulides videos that he doesn't care for others taking his info for reboardcast on their own podsites. I get that since he has done the hard work of reseaching, etc.  Then others want to repackage and 'sell' it for their own gain. 

Suggestion: Others who want their own site could do their own investigations of 'new' cases trying to follow the criteria that Paulides uses.  (Or maybe they could even get into cases that might not qualify, etc.)

Just too bad we can't get the 'real McCoy' here."
7942,2021-01-02 20:13:55,kmzqnd,I just found your channel last week or so. I love your content and the way that you talk about things. Keep on killin it bud!
7943,2021-01-03 10:51:14,kmzqnd,I love everything youve said in your original post here but one thing I would think is probable in aiding the likelihood of receiving attention and potential collaboration with Paulides is a name change bc it’s important for his brand not to be associated with anything potentially negative and the optics on collaborative work with “MrBallen” seems unlikely. Your efforts and work ethic and enthusiasm are all there and I think as a content creator you could be fine but working with David is difficult bc he is obsessed with being taken seriously and not as a fringe conspiracy guy.
7944,2020-12-30 10:42:42,kmzqnd,Thank you very much!! Ya his books are definitely pricey! Thanks!
7945,2021-01-01 06:16:29,kmzqnd,David regularly mentions this in all his videos and interviews. The books are for sale on his website www.canammissing.com  for 25$ any other website or Amazon are not sold by Dave and he doesn't profit from them. They are charging and insane amount of money and dave gets screwed. The books are excellent and 25$ is not expensive for the amount of information in these books I'm not sure about shipping overseas which seems to suck but if your interested most libraries have his books I've yet to look up a library that doesn't carry them but again not sure about UK :(
7946,2020-12-30 20:22:50,kmzqnd,Hahah that’s so ridiculous and very flattering! I’m really sorry about the injury but you clearly have a great outlook!!!

A lot of weird stuff happens here in The Natural State, and I’m willing to save up some cash to read a book about the disappearances around here. Two places that come to mind are the Hell’s Half Acre and the Devils Den, although I’ve personally had many weird experiences in the Hot Springs National Park where I was born. Do you know if Missing 411 has covered any parks in Arkansas?"

thanks!"
7966,2020-12-30 10:50:42,kmzqnd,Hahah love it!! Take care!!!
7967,2020-12-31 13:51:07,kmzqnd,You can the books off of his website for $25.  Go to Amazon and people are asking $200.
7968,2020-12-31 14:33:18,kmzqnd,"I feel like any of his books would be interesting to read, but yeah. Eight-year-old Katherine Van Alst disappeared from Devil's Den State Park. Google it, it's creepy. Also someone went missing from there just last year if I remember correctly. 

Additionally, I've heard of many bigfoot and UFO experiences there too. Any place with the word Devil in it, is named that for a reason. DPs book The Devils In The Details is a fantastic book to read about that, and he probably talks about Devils Den too."
7969,2020-12-31 08:48:33,kmzqnd,I Got the Canadian missing 411 for Christmas!!! It’s truly creepy and unnerving. But it’s really a worth buy if you can afford one of these gold mines

If half a million people are gunna see whatever you do just by default that’s honestly a great selling point. Im sure you have reached out and you both are probably busy but if you just compare your two channels, (CanAm vs you) its pretty clear he could get a good rub from you.

7972,2020-12-30 10:03:03,kmyzqi,"This list is one of the worst I've ever seen, damn.

It starts off pretty normal. But we can see that an aggregate of random people's opinions isn't always the best...

With Dwight at 18, here are some of the displayed comments:

> Dwight Howard is Beast! So what he's only 6""11 He can rebound over any 7footer. Is the best center of all time with Shaq and Moses Malone behind him. He can play D like I never saw before. And the only reason magic got out of the playoffs so early is because Superman was hurt. That's also why the sixers beat the bulls. Dwight is the best player I have saw in my Life! Superman is my Favorite player!

and

> What the crap?! Howard should be way higher than where he is. Wit Arenas and Richardson at his side the guy should have went farther up on this list. I mean come on DAWG! He was in the 09-10 finals against Kobe and co. And he put on a show wit Carter and nelson.

Seems like a site for 8 year olds"
7973,2020-12-30 11:29:30,kmyzqi,"Maybe not as obvious as the others but I don't get how Magic is always considered top 5. He played in the 80s West version of the 2010s East, was the second best player on his team for 2-3 championships and won multiple championships due to bogus refereeing. 

Now I'm not hating on Magic, he's the goat PG in my opinion and easily top 10 all time. But a lot of his accomplishments came because of the beneficial situation at the time."

7975,2020-12-30 14:38:03,kmyzqi,"He shouldn't be above Bird, imo. Before injuries got the best of him, Larry Legend was pretty clearly the better player. Longevity is important, but not as much as peak, and Larry had Magic beat in a lot of areas of the game in his peak."
7976,2020-12-30 16:24:47,kmy3l4,"This would be a really great point if Jeffrey, James, and Nikita weren’t already too big to just go away slowly. At this point they’re all rich enough and famous enough to be in the public eye for a long time (if you’re in the beauty space online at least) whether additional traffic is driven to their social media accounts or not."
7977,2020-12-30 17:03:37,kmy3l4,I think  you're confusing this sub with the circle jerk version.
7978,2020-12-30 15:01:58,kmy3l4,"When public figures act in a way that is actively harmful or promotes harmful behavior, they’re gonna get called out no matter how much it might bring them attention. I don’t care about their fans or if it makes them money. Not all of us live in a world where toxic behavior can just be ignored just because it’s inconvenient to bring it up. And these aren’t even just “fuck ups”. Some of these influencers have been blatantly racist or deliberately gone after other people. Ignoring that is just excusing it. 

What a bad take."
7979,2020-12-30 14:45:38,kmy3l4,"Simply ignoring people once they’ve gotten big doesn’t work in the real world. 

Talking here doesn’t get them any more money either. It does though inform others who don’t know stuff which is always good. People making fully informed decisions is never a bad thing. How do you think so many know how bad Jeff really is? From his comment section? No. From places like this. That’s how. Comment sections are echo chambers mostly and under control of that influencer. No real news and information happens there mostly. 

And going off your comments on this post you have no ground to call anyone else insecure. Yikes on all the bikes."
7980,2020-12-30 14:17:19,kmy3l4,"Thanks for the TED Talk, I do enjoy a nice big dose of condescension on a Wednesday afternoon."
7981,2020-12-30 18:28:47,kmy3l4,"This is stupid. R kelly would still be a free pedophile of people just ignored him. Outcry in Twitter literally is what led to wider stories victims feeling comfortable, a documentary, and finally some fucking justice. If you ignore them then brands will keep giving them money and they'll keep being a shitty person, just this time no one will be there to call them out."
7982,2020-12-30 19:06:45,kmy3l4,"I don't believe you're wrong, but you're likely preaching to the wrong crowd. You're primarily complaining about people calling out a problematic influencer on social media on a subreddit. Yes, some people on here do likely do it, but I doubt the majority do. We already know ""There is no such thing as bad press."" so we do choose to ignore them to not give them more publicity and ad revenue.

Sadly, I just don't think your ""solution"" to the problem is realistic. There are enough people out there of a certain group to be able to financially support influencers with different morals/beliefs. It's kind of like people that say to boycott Nestle or Walmart because of their horrible practices; sure, you can choose to personally do it because it makes you feel better, but they are a huge company that clearly hasn't been affected and will remain to operate."
7983,2020-12-30 15:08:31,kmy3l4,On the other hand I think these people have your fans who might not know about the things their fav has done. Some are open to learning more
7984,2020-12-30 22:46:39,kmy3l4,"i can agree with this. if i’m over someone, i unfollow them on youtube, IG, etc. I don’t find the need to hate them so much and watch their videos, every IG post/story, tweet to further spew hate. it’s dumb. just unfollow and move on. i know a lot of them have done and said damaging things. if needed, leave your one comment to call them out, announce your departure and be done. stop watching everything little thing they do to just talk about them more."
7985,2020-12-30 13:25:02,kmy3l4,"Good luck trying to get anyone to follow reason, this place is starting to turn into gurugossip, and i left that site because it became too negative. 

And i notice a lot of people try and get away with homophobic or misandry comments just because the person in question is racist, that doesn't excuse you from being a douchebag just because the said person in question is a douchebag."
7986,2020-12-30 14:04:56,kmy3l4,james charles and jeffree star fans mad huh?🤣
7987,2020-12-30 17:49:41,kmy3l4,"i agree to a certain point, but i don't think its late to make them go away - we've seen many big names go away simply by not giving them the attention they thrive in"
7988,2020-12-30 17:48:03,kmy3l4,which one is that? i would love to post there and not have to worry about offending people simply by stating the truth
7989,2020-12-30 15:12:06,kmy3l4,"most public figures THRIVE doing these harmful behavior. nikita dragun keeps getting called out, and nothing ever stops her. james charles keeps fucking up, but all he has to do is make an apology video and people forget about it. heck even shane dawson is EXPECTED to come back and i'm sure most people who are ""canceling"" him, will be watching him again."
7990,2020-12-30 15:06:57,kmy3l4,"Yikes on all the bikes indeed because I specifically said ""  it happens mostly under that person's social media "" - i'm not talking about on Reddit or anywhere outside that person's social media platforms. the cancel culture warriors tend to go to those places to criticize and post hate, they don't come to reddit.   

for example, james charles tiktok video that he got heat over, has more engagment than his usual stuff, care to explain why?"
7991,2020-12-30 14:22:01,kmy3l4,it's unfortunate you felt that way since that's not how it was intended.
7992,2020-12-31 06:16:53,kmy3l4,Thank you! I've learnt the most from your comment.
7993,2020-12-30 17:46:06,kmy3l4,i don't disagree
7994,2020-12-31 06:19:02,kmy3l4,this is exactly what I meant! but I don't think it resonated with people here because god knows if you dare tell people they are wrong here
7995,2020-12-31 06:19:27,kmy3l4,right!!!!
7996,2020-12-30 17:30:01,kmy3l4,Your post is stupid. You saying Jeff getting cancelled over a “fuck up” makes YOU sound like a fan of his
7997,2020-12-30 16:59:52,kmy3l4,Did you ever consider that your post and comments are simply just bad?

I noticed that it was starting to look like a Morphe palette, so I want to give it a snarky name like 42S-Morphe Sucks. I said James Charles because it's the same sort of half neutral-half colorful setup and the color story is similar but more tailored to my skin tone. So, it's like my version of that palette."

I know people think of nutrition and physical training improving in the future but I think the next big step for future nba players is learning the “chess” aspect of the NBA. How to get deep into film, dissect not only your own game but that of those around you etc. I really don’t think most NBA players learn how to get deep into film sessions until late in their careers unless those players are surrounded by great vets for years. 

Part of what makes a player like Rondo and LeBron able to “coast” throughout a season is because guys like that can already do what is required of them to be successful on the court and what’s left for them year to year is breaking down film. I mean that’s what the playoffs are all about. Sure they spend off seasons refining some on the court skills but I imagine at later stages in their career they focus on their health and just getting to the playoffs."
8094,2020-12-30 00:52:24,kmr32a,"What makes LeBron particularly unique is that, at any moment on the court, he is probably both the most athletic guy and also the smartest guy. That is just rare; usually the most cerebral guy in any sport isn’t *also* their sport’s best athlete. LeBron is. 

And he’s had to do so much to get into the GOAT argument. It’s a dozen and a half seasons of dominance, and counting. 

It’s going to take a hell of a lot. Takes a lot for someone to even sniff the all-time top 5."

My dad said in the 80's when they used to play fantasy hockey the league would either exclude Gretzky entirely, or have one ""player"" that was Gretzky's goals, and one ""player"" that was Gretzky's assists.

Can you imagine the basketball equivalent of that?! It would be absolutely insane. LeBron definitely has a case as the greatest ever, but he's never been more than like 10% better than the next best player in the league."

8119,2020-12-30 03:12:17,kmr32a,"Here's the fun thing about GOATness:

It doesn't respect age necessarily.

Kareem stepped onto the NBA court as the best player in the league.  He would have been the best player in the league if he had skipped college entirely. The only guy who could touch him was Wilt, but Wilt wasn't much of a winner.

MJ was almost universally accepted as GOAT after his 2nd championship and he never lost the title.

Best offensive player in league history. Best defensive player at his position ever. Doesn't necessarily have to go undefeated in finals series, but better be the MVP every time they win.

That's the bar.  The only way to reach higher than that is to be what he was, but win more titles, and sooner. Basically, it'd have to be someone who would go to a team with a solid roster due to some trade fluke like an unprotected pick and elevate them to titles almost immediately.

To illustrate my point: right now most folks would pick Brady as the GOAT QB in the NFL.  Should Pat Mahomes play his next 5-6 years like he's played his last 3, and win 3-4 more titles during that span, Brady will be getting inducted to the Pro Football HOF as the former GOAT. Greatness and immediate success > lesser output and longer term success."
8120,2020-12-30 02:14:35,kmr32a,"It's an interesting conversation. Luka seems like an evolution of both Lebron and Harden in many ways. It will be interesting and exciting to see how his career plays out. 

There are also guys like Jokic who aren't elite athletes, but are just so uniquely talented that they break the game of basketball and shape it into something that better suits them. Jokic plays even better in the playoffs because the game slows down and a half court offense lets him just plant his 7 foot frame in the paint and feed teammates.

There is also the rings argument. Lebron has many rings, but he has been flat outplayed many times in the finals as well. Jordan never was. And there may be other future athletes that don't have the physical gifts that Lebron does, but have an even stronger winner's mindset.

One thing I think many casual fans kinda right is that as much of a boss Lebron is, he does have his moments of mental weakness that Kobe and Jordan never really showed. 

I just don't think that there's only one way to win."
8121,2020-12-30 02:16:21,kmr32a,"As someone that team hops and absolutely needs 2 imported superstars per team to win a trophy, I’d have to say that as soon as someone can stay put and win titles with drafted teammates and role players, like GS did pre KD. “Adonal Foyle is not walking through that door!” Kidding lol. 

I say that as somebody that absolutely loves LBJs game. That doesn’t make him the GOAT lol. He’s a generational player, a legendary player, and definitely top 3 of all time, but if someone comes along and wins without pulling half the leagues allstars to his teams to win, is when we will have that “better” debate. 

I understand that’s the nature of today’s NBA, so I can’t 100% fault him for it, but you can’t call someone a GOAT when they need other top 5 superstars to and team go and in a league that doesn’t encourage any type of perimeter defense. 

I mean, I love Harden, even as mercurial as he is, but if he goes to Brooklyn or any other “super team”, I’ll say the same shit. That’s what was great about Golden State, they built that squad through the draft, but imported KD and blew the league away. They took a hit, as did KD, when he signed. They became the villains of the NBA for a minute. 

Cheesy and cheap, but hey, that’s today’s NBA.

Edit: All you EA and NBA2K fan kids don’t need to reply. I get why y’all love him, he’s your Jordan and he’s fun to play with on PS4.

8126,2020-12-30 07:26:09,kmr32a,Great post. I think the only way you could really say someone is better than Lebron is if there was an even taller Lebron. Like a giannis with great court vision and passing ability
8127,2020-12-30 07:40:16,kmr32a,"I disagree with your premise. Basketball greatness isn't defined as some mix of physical/mental traits. People like to argue things like ""Player X is better because he's 10% better at shooting while being 2% better at passing and only 4% worse at defense. Add those up and he's 8% better"". But the reality is that basketball doesn't work like that. 

LeBron isn't great because he's hyperathletic, or hyperathletic and smart at the same time. He's great because he wins basketball games against the other players of his era.

It's entirely possible that Giannis figures out how to win and has a Jordan-esque run. Or Luka. Or Zion. Or another player. 

It's hard to know, but the next player that will win 4+ championships and 3+ FMVPs is almost certainly already in the league."
8128,2020-12-30 14:45:00,kmr32a,"Yeah, that actually makes sense. Players like steph, shaq, mj are the best at something (shooting, rim dominance, winning). 
Lebron is great at everything, but not the best at any one thing. He's like the most versatile player."
8129,2020-12-30 15:17:14,kmr32a,Kanye West is a musical genius? Eh..
8130,2020-12-30 15:59:44,kmr32a,"Easy (not really). Someone that is 95% as good as LeBron but gets drafted into a Spurs type organization rather than Cleveland. Like say KD if they hadn't have traded Harden to avoid the luxury tax. KD isn't quite as good as Bron, but say he goes 5-0 with the Thunder we probably see them as the same right?

KD and Giannis are the best mold of players in terms of size and athleticism. Giannis doesn't have the shot and KD just hasn't quite had the right luck and teams to amass the stats he would need to be a challenger, but I think the next possible contender to that status fits that mold."
8131,2020-12-31 01:25:54,kmr32a,"Healthy zion Williams?

8134,2020-12-30 01:28:47,kmr32a,"Other factors to be considered GOAT are championship rings.

So realistically, we could have someone equally as good as Lebron but started off with a good team (so more rings) and he would be considered the GOAT"
8135,2020-12-30 00:48:33,kmr32a,Lebron is not better than MJ.  Basketball is a game of skill not just physicality.  Mj was the more complete basketball player whereas LBJ was more complete as an athlete.
8136,2020-12-30 00:48:37,kmr32a,Very cringy.
8137,2020-12-30 00:57:47,kmr32a,I feel like the next goat candidate is probably a big man that’s like a mix of jokic and bam
8138,2020-12-30 01:09:41,kmr32a,Well there needs to be someone better than current LeBron first.
8139,2020-12-30 04:05:25,kmr32a,"> Like what would a better version of LeBron even be?

IMO the most physically gifted player I've ever seen in the NBA was Shaq. I think Shaq would have unquestionably been considered the GOAT if he had the same drive that guys like Jordan and LeBron have. Jordan was nearly psychotic about what he would do to win, and LeBron puts every ounce he can into maximizing what he can do (i.e. hyperbaric chambers, cryogenics, spending over $1 million a year on his body, etc). Shaq rarely took very good care of himself and would often show up to camp out of shape and just use the season to work himself into shape.

I've always been convinced that when you're as physically gifted as Shaq, to where in college he was getting quadruple teamed and it didn't matter, and in the pros nobody could stop him either, it was probably hard to have it inside himself to push himself to his limit. Why bother when he'd almost surely been able to utterly dominate everyone forever? A big part of what made Michael Jordan who he was was probably him being cut from the team in HS cause he wasn't good enough. I doubt Shaq ever had anything like that happen to him.

Shaq was a fairly lazy player throughout his career, but even still he's a top 10-15 player all time. As good as he was he really only deserved 1 or maybe 2 MVP awards and he never led the league in either rebounding or blocks (while guys like Chris Webber an Shawn Bradley did). So my answer for what a ""better version of LeBron"" would look like is if we get someone else with a physique and athleticism like Shaq but with more motivation and drive and work ethic like Jordan or LeBron."
8140,2020-12-30 00:53:40,kmr32a,"I honestly don’t get the whole mentality thing. The guy has more buzzer playoff game winners than Jordan, kobe, Durant and Curry COMBINED"

These types of posts lack self-awareness."
8157,2020-12-30 01:38:43,kmr32a,"I’m about to turn this into Russell vs. Wilt.

I mean, how can you not give Wilt a share of the GOAT title, if only for a year?"
8158,2020-12-30 06:52:43,kmr32a,"kobe was great but never a goat candidate, in fact in that gen it was probably duncan/shaq and even that is a stretch."
8159,2020-12-30 18:56:43,kmr32a,Agree. Lebron will be reminded more for the longevity of his dominance tham for the size of that dominance.
8160,2020-12-30 03:12:23,kmr32a,I think it’s more Lebron’s leadership skills. Durant is definitely not lacking bball IQ
8161,2020-12-30 06:25:28,kmr32a,"You'd still need LeBron's strength, speed, and athleticism. So I think LeBron with Durant's shooting would be even better."
8162,2020-12-30 05:44:41,kmr32a,Uhm that's michael jordan
8163,2020-12-30 03:08:56,kmr32a,"I’m not going to be that Mavs fan who says Luka will be the GOAT. However, I think it’s interesting to talk about what the GOAT debate would look like if Luka does continue improving along his trajectory. 

I don’t know why OP assumes that something has to be categorically different about a new player for them to be better than LeBron. Luka’s stats in his first two years have been very similar to LeBron’s first two years. If that continues and Luka has a very similar career trajectory to LeBron, but he happens to have a better team around him and wins 2 more rings or something, would that be enough? If Luka matches MVPs of LeBron but goes 7-2 in the finals, or something similar, I think that’s put him in GOAT contention even if he’s not “better” at any individual part of the game. 

I guess I’m just saying that basketball is a team sport, so someone on a similar level to LeBron (still a once in a generation talent) could look a lot better in the GOAT debate if they happen to have a better team built around them"
8164,2021-01-01 00:45:14,kmr32a,"Lebron's only been outplayed twice in the finals: 2007, 2011."

8170,2020-12-30 06:19:08,kmr32a,"I think it somewhat correlates with what Shaq already has. I mean he's already unstoppable in his form regardless of the mindset he has and how he's approached the game. Him being that way, the physical freak of nature he is, doesn't require him to be that relentless assassin that would strike over and over again. He isn't as lazy as what us normal average people think. The lazy standard between us and a professional basketball superstar is different. He still works hard for sure because he wouldn't have the skills he possesses if he didn't. It's just that he did have that ""extra"" drive to be able to overcome history. To be able to compete with history itself. And if ever he has that, who knows if his body can take that ""extra"" toll as well. That's why it's not that simple to just say Shaq with MJ mentality would be instantly the GOAT."
8171,2020-12-30 02:39:30,kmr32a,"You don't get to quit in an NBA playoff series and pretend that you have an edge on mentality.

Lebron is a fucking weakling compared to the others."
8172,2020-12-30 20:36:33,kmr32a,"Lebron is a top 5 most physical player in the league, lol. If they allowed more physicality man would dominate even more."
8173,2020-12-30 04:09:26,kmr32a,You realize LeBron got drafted in 03/04 right. He literally played for the majority of the 2000s and won 2 MVPS. Why wouldn't he be able to handle the physicality?
8174,2020-12-31 01:41:01,kmr32a,"He is a beast in this era and players now are bigger and stronger, more physicality would be to Brons advantage"
8175,2020-12-30 16:04:54,kmr32a,You used a lot of pretend sounding smart words in those first few sentences just to ignore the fact that his question was clearly about the future.
8176,2020-12-30 01:00:13,kmr32a,Kobe isn’t a GOAT candidate.
8177,2020-12-30 01:18:22,kmr32a,That's not that crazy. MJ was killing it before his injury.
8178,2020-12-30 13:58:50,kmr32a,Kobe wasn't even the best player in his team at that point
8179,2020-12-31 01:44:05,kmr32a,Lebron has 4 rings right? Imo this year is number 5 and next year hell want 6. Pretty crazy
8180,2020-12-30 02:22:06,kmr32a,What an absolute shit take.

8183,2020-12-30 04:30:53,kmr32a,"Rookie year Saquon is the greatest shit I've ever seen on the football field. Ever. Man was weaving in, out, around, and over defenders while surrounded.

And coaching, scheming, blocking, nothing had anything to do with it. It was all Saquon and his massive thighs."
8184,2020-12-30 08:18:41,kmr32a,"I forgot where I heard this recently, but someone recently mentioned how old school coaching staffs differed from today’s and the biggest difference being that today’s coaching staffs are much much larger because of the amount of film that is compiled before games for head coaches and players to review. If this is relatively new in the professional coaching world, could you imagine what players in the future will be like if they have these types of resources before they even reach NBA or even college? 

It’s fascinating to imagine what the league would look like if an entire generation of players one day become cerebral players."
8185,2020-12-30 09:13:14,kmr32a,"Jokic and Rondo are not on par with the Basketball IQ of Lebron. I think Rondo is closer, but Jokic, as amazing as he is at his age, is not near Lebron levels of Basketball IQ."

8187,2020-12-30 02:53:16,kmr32a,That’d do it.
8188,2021-01-01 00:18:52,kmr32a,"He'd be close to Lebron currently with average shooting, but Peak Lebron would still be in a tier of his own compared to current players + supergiannis"

8190,2020-12-30 01:15:40,kmr32a,Good point
8191,2020-12-30 17:34:52,kmr32a,"He didn’t say that lebron was the sure fire goat. He said he thinks he is. Either way, lebron is first or second and that doesn’t take away from the point of the post."
8192,2020-12-30 09:42:37,kmr32a,Kobe was closer in age to LeBron than he was to Shaq. What we define as a generation is pretty arbitrary.
8193,2020-12-31 21:35:16,kmr32a,Lol this. He’s got really high IQ. I’d say if he was as good at passing and facilitating he’d have a pretty strong case for it
8194,2020-12-30 06:23:12,kmr32a,Lol no
8195,2020-12-30 20:34:28,kmr32a,Luka hasn’t shown close to enough on defense to look like someone who will eventually be in the GOAT conversation. Amazing player but he needs to develop on that side of the ball a lot to be on that level.
8196,2020-12-30 00:55:52,kmr32a,Y’all really never watched jordan huh
8197,2020-12-30 01:28:45,kmr32a,Semantics but I'd say that LeBron is the best while mj is the greatest.

8202,2020-12-30 04:11:02,kmr32a,"He handled it, but they changed the rules to make sure he could. He’s a great person, a great basketball player, but definitely not the best ever. Happy holidays. Endless debate."
8203,2020-12-31 01:46:02,kmr32a,Yeah I im not sure he'll catch up in rings but that wouldn't surprise me since he's on the Lakers and has a top level player like AD beside him and likely they will constantly upgrade the team.
8204,2020-12-30 05:02:03,kmr32a,"Love DH but he’s not an All-Star in 2 major professional sports. 

When I was a kid I thought we’d start seeing guys like Bo and Deion all the time. I’m still waiting."

8206,2020-12-30 05:00:27,kmr32a,But could he also hit a baseball 450 feet?
8207,2020-12-30 11:41:06,kmr32a,"Exactly. With Lebron it’s everything: dictating pace, accurate passes, seeing plays before they happen, jumping in front and getting steals and blocks. 

Just being a great passer doesn’t necessarily mean you have the best BBIQ"
8208,2020-12-30 02:38:39,kmr32a,Man raises a good point

Not only does this disregard the fact that there are tons of shorter players who are bad shooters, it also disregards the fact that many all time great shooters were tall, like bird, durant, Miller, even his own teammate Klay.  Well written enough post but only skin deep analysis."
8213,2020-12-30 01:24:30,kmr32a,It's pretty clear you haven't either except for youtube highlights.
8214,2020-12-30 03:39:43,kmr32a,MJ was also the best
8215,2020-12-30 01:15:54,kmr32a,Mj was a more complete basketball player? Put down the god damn crack pipe.
8216,2020-12-30 03:09:47,kmr32a,"Lmao Jordan wouldn’t make the playoffs with them? Source. 

If we’re just pulling hot takes out of our ass - harden could’ve taken the 2018 cavs out of the 2018 eastern conference"
8217,2020-12-30 20:45:25,kmr32a,"This is just inaccurate. Honestly I have no fucking idea where it even comes from, it’s not based on any reality. It’s also the dumbass argument people used against Jordan when he was getting clotheslined by the pistons. 

Seriously—do you have any actual examples of Lebron reacting negatively to physical play? The fact that he’s so big and physical that he has to sell calls while little players like harden get touched a little and go to the line? That’s your argument? 

Also, who are you saying in the league is more physical than Lebron? Especially stars. 

I’m sorry, it’s just a dumbass, nonsense argument that people only listen to because it’s so nebulous and can’t be disproven. What do you even mean by physical? He’s not getting punched in the face so he’s not tough enough? You want Lawrence Taylor to tackle him on the way to the rim? Seriously, what do you want to see? What’s your proof?"
8218,2020-12-30 07:35:31,kmr32a,"Don't you think that's an extremely high standard though? Not trying to sound like or be a dick, but very few athletes have All-Starred in 2 pro sports. Do you feel like you're not giving athletes who don't play pro in two sports a fair shake? Geniuely curious, again, not trying to be a dick."
8219,2020-12-30 05:49:08,kmr32a,"I feel like he could. So many NFL and NBA elite athletes could easily make a name for themselves in the MLB if they trained for it from a young age.

Basically almost every NFL and NBA player who's ever played high school baseball has been drafted by the MLB straight out of high school at like 18, including Brady. These players instead choose to play college ball for 3-4 years and go into NFL at 22.

Like Brandon Weeden was a 2nd round MLB pick, returned to college, became a 1st round QB basically at 27."
8220,2020-12-30 13:55:34,kmr32a,"Jokic is much more than a great passer though, you obviously don't watch him enough.

Not that I necessarily disagree with the take that LeBron has higher BBIQ than Jok, but Jok is definitely up there."

8222,2020-12-30 01:28:29,kmr32a,I didn’t even read that point tbh. I was just focusing on the fact that a new “GOAT” candidate seems to come in at the same time the previous one leaves
8223,2020-12-30 01:31:39,kmr32a,"Unfortunately, I’m probably old enough to be your dad. I’ve watched plenty of Jordan and Lebron."
8224,2020-12-30 03:57:50,kmr32a,I've come around on that personally. Like I said it's semantics though so it depends on your definition and criteria. They're basically 1a and 1b at this point because a good argument can be made for both.

8227,2020-12-30 08:07:16,kmr32a,"Yes it’s an extremely high standard that’s the point, Bo and Deion reached it and made it look easy.

I was younger and thought athletes like that were gonna naturally become more frequent. 20+ years later they haven’t. 

Though I do put Lebron in that category I think he could’ve been an All-Pro in the NFL."
8228,2020-12-30 05:57:05,kmr32a,Let me know when one of them actually does it. Tons of guys get drafted in baseball but we are talking about All-Star level talent in both sports not Brandon Weedon.
8229,2020-12-30 06:22:52,kmr32a,"It's a little hard to see your point about NFL and NBA players easily being able to cross over to the MLB when one of your examples, (Weeden), alongside a few other high-profile cases (Russell Wilson, Shaq Thompson), ended up in the NFL because they weren't good enough to make the MLB."
8230,2020-12-30 16:19:15,kmr32a,"I agree he is up there, but saying that Jokic (who has generational BBIQ for his age) is on par with Lebrons 17 years of experience is almost an insult to lebron"

I do think they’re overhated tho"
8232,2020-12-30 20:50:27,kmr32a,See? You don’t even have an argument. Simmer down with the trash takes.
8233,2020-12-30 08:18:14,kmr32a,"They may have made it look easy, but also, not everyone wants to do that. The way medical treatment has advanced does make sense for athletes to pursue other pro sports more, but that may just not what they want to do that.

I love LBJ, but idk if he could handle being hit like they do in the NFL. I can honestly see every close call, LBJ crying to the refs."
8234,2020-12-30 06:12:42,kmr32a,"You can discount Weeden all you want, but he got himself picked in the 2nd round of MLB. Bo Jack was 4th round.

But forget it. Nobody in the NFL and NBA give a shit about the MLB. It's a retirement/curious hobby like golfing. Kyler went 9th overall to the A's despite him continuously denying wanting to play MLB.

Just cause Bo Jack decided to go actually boycott the NFL and play MLB full time unlike everybody else doesn't make him special. 

Deion Sanders was an NFL GOAT and juggled an MLB career as a side hobby for the fuck of it.

Elway was picked in the 2nd and given a bigger bonus than the #1 overall...and he still basically used that as an excuse to get hinself traded from the Colts to Broncos and nothing else. MLB ain't shit."
8235,2020-12-30 06:26:16,kmr32a,"Kyler then. Elway. Deion. 

And for the record, many of the NFL players drafted never even played much baseball in college and were committed to football, hence why they were drafted late. My point is that crossover athletes don't give a f. about baseball."
8236,2020-12-30 17:35:46,kmr32a,"Lmao yeah cuz anyone else being good is an insult to lebron. I fully believe jokic sees the court the same way lebron, Kidd, Nash, cp3 do. And I fully believe none of you here can accurately tell me who has the best and worst court vision and IQ out of those 5, cuz they’re all geniuses and pretty much know what any defense will do. It’s not an insult to any of them, and lebron is a better player than all of them, but because of his athleticism and scoring."
8237,2020-12-30 01:30:22,kmr32a,"The popular opinion now among fans under 30 is that the prequels are better than the originals.  It happens when you grow up with something.  In your head that thing you grew up with is the best and nothing is going to dissuade you from it.  I'm not going to bother arguing Mj vs. LBJ just remember this when the next ""Goat"" player comes to challenge Lebron."

8239,2020-12-30 12:43:56,kmr32a,‘He cry’s to the refs’ because it works whether you like it or not. As op said people are a product of their circumstance. He obviously wouldn’t do this if he was in the nfl because if he tried it and it didn’t work he wouldn’t keep doing it
8240,2020-12-30 06:50:05,kmr32a,MLB drafts are huge and kind of a crap shoot.  Theres a pretty long development path after they are drafted and most guys end up being minor leaguers for life.
8241,2020-12-30 06:15:49,kmr32a,"I hate baseball but you’re just categorically wrong. You think Weedon gave up being an All-Star in baseball to ride the bench in the NFL? 

We are talking about humans who can be All-Stars in multiple sports so, yes, I will continue to discount Brandon Weedon."

1) he’s gay. There is still a large number of people hating on him because he’s a guy who wears makeup and is gay.

2) he’s successful. He’s a tall poppy prime candidate. His success is pretty impressive, and some people just like to hate on people who make money off YouTube.

3) he’s ditzy. Some people find it endearing and some find it enraging. 

4) he’s actually not “fully gay”, he’s bi. Biphobics abound.

5) he’s racist. The ill timed Ebola comment was pretty insensitive.

6) he called Ariana grande the rudest celebrity he’s ever met.

7) he’s a phoney. His morphe collaboration swatch video he double swatched some colours to exaggerate how pigmented they were.

8) he doesn’t care about his fans. The shade “skip” from his palette is a pressed pigment so it stains, and some had allergic reactions. His response was that anyone who knows the first thing about makeup knows that pink/red/purple pressed pigment stains.

9) he’s a liar. He edits his photos.

10) He’s a hypocrite. One minute he’s criticising a red carpet look, next minute he’s wearing something similar.

11) he’s manipulative. He’s been accused of trying to manipulate straight guys into having sex.

12) Tati Westbrook."
8247,2020-12-30 00:56:39,kmqvcd,"James Charles isn’t a saint. He made a pretty poor taste Ebola tweet a year or so ago, and although he was 17-18, as a public figure it was in poor taste. I’ve seen that he’s also somewhat transphobic by implying that he’s not “entirely gay” because apparently to him, transitioned men aren’t ‘real men.’ Remember, he’s relatively young. I think he’s 19 (my age), so I cut him some slack, but for an LGBT icon and public figure he should really watch what he says and posts online. 

That being said, I think the hate for him is blown out of proportion."

8318,2021-06-07 02:08:28,km6xrg,"I have some questions about the other characters involved.  What do we know about Fleet White?  I can’t find out much.  I read the deposition of the girl who alleges Fleet’s dad would rape her as a kid.  He also would give her a teddy bear thereafter.  I remember Jonbenet said a friend was coming over to give her a teddy bear???  The girls story was so sad.  Her family was in on it.  I also read that she was an unreliable source.  However that doesn’t mean much from a group of people who can’t or WON’T solve this case.  Why was she Deemed not credible?  Because that deposition 100% ties into your theory.  

Also, what do we know about the Stines and that fortunate job at Access Direct that fell into his lap?  What did they used to do for a living?  It’s hard to imagine leaving a job that could afford the life style they were accustomed.  How did all these winners meet in the first place?  What about the preacher?  Was he the leader of the cult?  I read some far fetched sounding story about some Bible church in Colorado from some chick named Danielle (I think). Does this group tie in?  And finally, who the hell is best buds with their daughters pediatrician?  Didn’t they invite him over too?   Were all these people other then the stines there before the police arrived on the 26th?  Is it true Jonbenet had been to that same pediatrician 33x for yeast infections over that past year?

 I read some guess that she was killed at the Christmas party?  David Icke calls this ritual “The Last Lightbulb.”  Perhaps they Fed her pineapple just before the act, then moved her and the rest of the pineapple to the Ramsey’s ?  How long do those rituals last?  Can you imagine if they started on the 24th(thus the 911 call) and didn’t finish until the next day?

I’m just talking off the top of my head"
8319,2020-12-29 16:05:22,km6xrg,What happened to Gerald Richards after the deal?
8320,2021-06-07 06:09:46,km6xrg,"Cavdef George has collected a lot of information about Fleet White, you should check his page out. Look up Cavdef Jonbenet. There are a lot of questions here that are difficult to discuss all at once. But a lot of your questions are solid questions that deserve an answer. One I can answer is on the pineapple. 

People want to read something sinister into something that by all accounts was likely done out of mercy. In the minds of those who were involved, the child was going to die no matter what. This was a way of giving her something she loved before doing it. It was a piss poor effort so they could lie to themselves that they gave her everything they could. It was likely fed to her by her father as a means of mitigating guilt. 

There are lots of questions here and honestly many of them have many answers depending on whom you ask. I do not have all the answers. I have some of the answers, but definitely not all. 

As for the ""rituals"", remember, these are fancy names that pedophiles give what is by all accounts simply a method of weeding those who will talk from those who won't. By all accounts the murders exist first and foremost for control of the people involved in the crimes. The idea of ""rituals"" and all that stuff are mostly what true believers within the network follow, not the masses. These people are NOT lining up to perform some satanic sacrifice, all chanting with smiles on their faces. They are lining up after being blackmailed with information that will 100 percent end their lives as they know it, sometimes putting them behind bars for a very, very long time. Are they participating in a ritual? Yes, by the definition of the term. But the reason that information gravitates towards this extreme is simply the idea of 100s of people with smiles on their faces chanting satanic sayings killing a child sounds too ridiculous and too far fetched with our understanding of humans on a day to day level. In other words, the reason why these ideas about what happened are promoted is because nobody will believe them and they sound cooky. If it were described as simply an initiation right into a network of people who sexually molest children so that nobody speaks or rats each other out, people would be able to see it and something would have to be done about it.

I don't like focusing on the occultic elements as I believe they are red herrings so to speak. You aren't going to convince people who do not believe in superstitious stuff superstitious stuff. It just isnt going to happen. So my focus has NEVER been on that element though I applaud some great researchers who do dive into that element. My focus is mainly on the criminal network revolving around pedophilia that has had its roots in this country for too fucking long."

8375,2020-12-29 01:02:23,klz1k3,"The first time we've gotten Chris Myers this year.

Usually, we get him quite a bit and he always calls our preseason games."
8376,2020-12-29 17:01:31,klz1k3,Why can't Joe buck and troy Aikman announce the bears game?
8377,2020-12-29 17:48:00,klz1k3,kevin harlen so underrated. Bills haven't got CBS A team this year. No rates
8378,2020-12-30 04:41:43,klz1k3,Where do you get this information from or are they just guesses?
8379,2021-01-03 01:03:08,klz1k3,Well he got Covid
8380,2021-01-03 19:49:45,klz1k3,Where is Aqib Talib
8381,2020-12-28 22:46:10,klz1k3,"Already been posted

8382,2020-12-28 21:19:42,klz1k3,Fuuuuuck Collinsworth
8383,2020-12-28 21:42:53,klz1k3,Beth mowins and tiki barber. Never had that combo before.
8384,2020-12-28 21:34:16,klz1k3,"Yeah, but Kevin Harlan is really S tier. The question is how many games will he call at once?"
8385,2020-12-28 21:35:54,klz1k3,Which CBS game did you want Romo? Are you sure there wasn’t a better option for them?
8386,2020-12-28 22:42:17,klz1k3,Isn't Ian Eagle the B-team? He called our game against you.
8387,2020-12-28 21:12:30,klz1k3,Lol Vilma time baby.
8388,2020-12-28 23:59:40,klz1k3,Imagine being in a playoff seeding hunt and they send Vilma to call your game. I have not enjoyed a single game he called this year.
8389,2020-12-28 21:21:25,klz1k3,"I'm not, New York and Dallas are massive markets and will be televised in every area that doesn't have a local team and the game has avtual meaning as the winner is still alive."
8390,2020-12-28 21:54:42,klz1k3,I approve of the fact that they aren't.
8391,2020-12-28 23:16:37,klz1k3,Harlan announcing Week 17 Dolphins game. We're winning this one 😎
8392,2020-12-28 21:22:07,klz1k3,Sparrow Deeds and Adam Architecture
8393,2020-12-28 21:26:33,klz1k3,You don’t know who Spero dedes is?
8394,2020-12-28 21:34:40,klz1k3,Spero Dedes is underrated. Especially by his own company as he’s always calling the E-list game
8395,2020-12-28 21:22:22,klz1k3,We've been getting some c and d tier announcers this year...
8396,2020-12-28 21:29:24,klz1k3,I miss Kevin Harlan calling Lamar Jackson plays
8397,2020-12-28 22:43:27,klz1k3,They almost exclusively call Cincinnati games
8398,2020-12-28 21:20:44,klz1k3,"If you’re referring to the Super Bowl, yes"
8399,2020-12-28 21:55:27,klz1k3,8
8400,2020-12-28 22:14:54,klz1k3,I know they'd never do it but I want a whole game of Mike Pereira & Dean Blandino sipping Tito's & just talking openly.
8401,2020-12-28 23:37:55,klz1k3,Dude is so bad lol
8402,2020-12-28 23:07:07,klz1k3,It might be a Backup QB battle
8403,2020-12-28 21:26:09,klz1k3,^I ^don’t ^actually ^mind ^him ^anymore
8404,2020-12-28 21:34:24,klz1k3,Extra Fuuuuuuck Collinsworth without the slide in.
8405,2020-12-28 23:04:52,klz1k3,We could’ve had Phillies commentator Tom McCarthy but nOoOoOoO it has to be SNF
8406,2020-12-28 21:50:33,klz1k3,🤮
8407,2020-12-28 22:31:10,klz1k3,"I was gonna say, Harlan is awesome"
8408,2020-12-28 21:18:48,klz1k3,He is so bad my god
8409,2020-12-28 21:23:46,klz1k3,He sucks
8410,2020-12-28 21:25:36,klz1k3,"Yeah but GB-CHI will  get lead  distribution in the 4:25 window and that’s usually their game


I guess it makes sense this week, because the only reason why NYg-DAL isn’t the lead 4:25 is because so many races in the nfc hinge on west coast teams, so the saints and packers games have to clog up 2 spots"
8411,2020-12-28 22:26:21,klz1k3,And he *DICKS* Wilson
8412,2020-12-28 21:53:01,klz1k3,Am I getting wooshed? He’s awful
8413,2020-12-28 22:43:47,klz1k3,So they are the Z team?
8414,2020-12-28 21:50:33,klz1k3,I used to hate Buck and Aikman but over the last 3 to 4 seasons they have grown on me and have gotten better. Buck actually has some life in his play by play now instead of everything being at one volume.
8415,2020-12-28 21:35:48,klz1k3,its probably because the NFL doesn't like having the A crews fighting viewership.  CBS has the late game and FOX had to pick an early game.
8416,2020-12-28 22:48:12,klz1k3,"Pretty much yeah. Kinda surprised we have them for this one, we usually get bumped up at least one crew when we play Ravens"
8417,2020-12-28 21:37:42,klz1k3,This can’t be true. Nantz and buck have gone against each other in week 17 almost every year
8418,2020-12-28 21:48:52,klz1k3,"In Week 17, both FOX and CBS have doubleheaders."
8419,2020-12-31 16:53:44,klz1k3,"False.  Last week 17, buck did was dallas 425 while nantz did titans texans 425"
