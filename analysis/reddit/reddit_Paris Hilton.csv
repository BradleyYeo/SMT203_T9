1,2020-02-04 02:53:03,eyiz2r,"I think technology has moved past the need for MTV as a main source of music consumption. That said, if they want to keep their (left-over) relevance, they‚Äôve got to improve the things they do that are still music related for the new audience. I‚Äôve said this before and I‚Äôll say it again:

üëè**STREAM**üëè**THE**üëè**VMA‚ÄôS**üëè**ON**üëè**YOUTUBE**"
2,2020-02-04 03:04:32,eyiz2r,"Personally, by splitting the company into two groups; television and digital. Television can continue doing what they do, I honestly don't know that world or how well they're doing there. With digital, focusing exclusively on really being edgy online. Like they should have been on the forefront of tik tok, they should have been the ones producing edgy/unique content like Colors does in how they highlight new talent, and so on.

Even as new technology is like right there that they should be jumping on, like virtual reality performances (Tinashe with The Wave XR for example) they should be ON IT producing content, selling tickets. Livestreaming is huge now, yet they're still playing ball with cable by not having their content globally available in a livestream. So many artists now are doing things on the side like Doja Cat making deals with I think it was Caffeine to stream playing video games, again MTV should be right there making it happen. 

But at this point, I think it's just too late like once you get to be that big of a company and you start moving slowly... it takes firing like everyone for any real change to happen."
3,2020-02-04 02:57:54,eyiz2r,"You really can't do anything to help it out. 

TV is slowly dying, and as music and how it is created becomes more and more easily available online, Mtv becomes more useless. They need to focus their energy to their online presence. Hell, their most popular show right now is LITERALLY just taking videos from the internet and having people add commentary. Make the VMA's viewable via livestream, do more artist interviews online, and just do interesting and unpredictable things again. If they don't adapt to a changing media landscape, they will not survive the shift."
4,2020-02-04 04:53:01,eyiz2r,"I really don‚Äôt think there is any reviving it. It‚Äôs sad to say, but it‚Äôs evident it‚Äôs run its course and is struggling to keep up with the times. Reality TV will keep it thriving, but in regards to music, there‚Äôs just better options, I guess. 

Like I used to think how cool would it be for them to bring back Unplugged on a consistent basis but then I remembered... there‚Äôs VEVO Presents. Which is, at its core, the same thing. A small, intimate concert. 

It just ain‚Äôt 1999 - 2007 anymore smh"
5,2020-02-04 03:01:21,eyiz2r,Destroy the internet.
6,2020-02-04 06:08:36,eyiz2r,"You forgot ""Cribs""! Mariah's dozens of wardrobe changes! When she pretended to find her dog in the dryer! When she pretended to take it all off in the jacuzzi! Exercising in heels!

Nowadays, though, all of that memetic gold would just happen on an artist's Instagram/Snapchat story, completely cutting out the middle man that is MTV. Which, really, is just another example of how MTV is obsolete."
7,2020-02-04 12:00:55,eyiz2r,"Live performances.      

Australia does something called ""The Set"" where they have 3-4 artists come on the show, perform, and do some interviews. High quality recordings of live performances are pretty hard to find on YouTube.      

If MTV gave me the ability to view high quality live performances of my favorite artists, I'd give them another chance for sure."
8,2020-02-04 07:41:24,eyiz2r,"I wouldn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs 2020, we are well into the streaming era now. MTV doesn‚Äôt serve a purpose anymore. Times have changed"

10,2020-02-04 02:47:36,eyiz2r,"the only way they will is if they get huge names to release new music (i.e lady gaga, adele)"

12,2020-02-04 06:26:03,eyiz2r,I think Spotify could try this. But they should fix their shitty app first.
13,2020-02-04 17:26:16,eyiz2r,"I still can‚Äôt believe they haven‚Äôt started streaming award shows online, its 2020 üò≠"

16,2020-02-04 03:04:13,eyiz2r,in what way? a live concert? a music video premiere?
17,2020-02-04 09:40:19,eyiz2r,An unnecessary challenge
18,2020-02-04 03:58:49,eyiz2r,"it doesn‚Äôt really matter, they just need big stars back on mtv"
19,2020-02-04 05:24:45,eyiz2r,"Tons of huge artists, most who probably grew up loving MTV, like Ariana Billie Lizzo Taylor Camila Normani Tinashe Shawn Lil Nas X Cardi B, released music this year but none went on MTV"
20,2020-02-04 13:07:26,eyiz2r,i am aware. that‚Äôs why i‚Äôm saying for mtv to be revived they need big artists to come back to the network
21,2020-02-03 21:25:35,eycoha,"If there's a country singer under one of those masks, I'll hear it. Huge fan."
22,2020-02-04 13:32:01,eycoha,"I don‚Äôt think any of the delivery trailer is true anymore. Paris may be on the show, but I doubt she‚Äôs the Mouse. When the frog was delivered a woman was exercising, I doubt that‚Äôs true. I don‚Äôt think we can trust anything in that first trailer."
23,2020-02-03 22:26:34,eycoha,I have a feeling Paris 100% is on the show.. my guess the mouse.  Star as the night angel
24,2020-02-03 22:30:51,eycoha,"Yes, but we know that the Robot was misleading us in that trailer. Is it possible Paris is under another?"
25,2020-02-03 17:44:39,eyajcr,I wonder if I'll see us win at Bordeaux in my lifetime
26,2020-02-03 17:43:21,eyajcr,Fantastic post!

we didn't lose

crab emoji"
28,2020-02-03 19:53:07,eyajcr,"Please continue ! 


As a Strasbourg supporter, this season is like every season before: when I expect them to win, they loose and vice-versa. 

So next week, against the weakest of the weakest teams, Toulouse (sorry southerners buddies), I expect an easy game. But I won't be surprised if we give Toulouse a long-awaited victory, especially since they managed to get a draw this weekend."
29,2020-02-03 17:48:15,eyajcr,"I was a supporter of Elsner at Amiens at the start of the season, but now I am forced to say he doesn‚Äôt look good enough for the job. Pellissier‚Äôs team wasn‚Äôt perfect, but they at least seemed able to avoid relegation. 

Elsner is playing offensive football, but it just doesn‚Äôt work. Problem of squad ? Coach ? Bit of both ? After all, with their budget, they are exactly where they are supposed to be. But it‚Äôs unfortunate because they did manage to display some nice football at the start of the season."
30,2020-02-03 18:14:54,eyajcr,"I can't wait the game against Reims, we're still shaky but there are some promising things, Dolberg is fantastic, Badaoui last games have been great, Durmisi is going to play so Nsoki is going to rest (he needs it...), ACM begins to show his real level and Danilo fits great in his new hybrid position between CB and DM.

Aside from that, thanks u/boucot for this another great post, although I think there's a missing section where you should put smiling Dolberg photos."
31,2020-02-03 18:00:05,eyajcr,"Ah nice for Dolberg doing well. 

I love watching Lille whenever I can, literally don't know what you're getting with them"
32,2020-02-03 18:33:54,eyajcr,"this season is too weird

also good content, thank you for posting"
33,2020-02-03 18:38:52,eyajcr,Marseille can lose their CL spot if they don't wake up
34,2020-02-03 17:48:16,eyajcr,Montpellier are butchers.

36,2020-02-03 21:04:12,eyajcr,"Great post. Glad Dolberg is doing alright.

Weird that Puel has now managed Lyon and Sainte."
37,2020-02-03 21:49:42,eyajcr,Amazing post as always
38,2020-02-04 02:29:54,eyajcr,Great write ups! Hopefully more people will be inspired to check out ligue 1 bc of them.

42,2020-02-03 19:05:49,eyajcr,I think they'll be fine with Thauvin coming back. Benedetto's bad spell will stop at some time too. And it's not like the teams behind them are particularly consistent.
43,2020-02-03 20:23:59,eyajcr,"Indeed. But our tiny roster doesn't help to keep the team rested & in shape. iirc we don't even have 20 pro players with Ligue 1 experience, all the others are fresh puppies coming straight from the academy."
44,2020-02-03 20:08:23,eyajcr,Someone forgot the Spahic/Pitau/Jeunechamp golden era.

55,2020-02-02 15:38:40,exo2t3,"I really wouldn't recommend a train from Italy to the UK. It's far, 1200miles on a train sounds pretty rough. There's no direct trains, there's not even one stop trains(from most of Italy). You'll have a minimum of 2 probably 3-4 stops. It will cost 3-4x the amount of a flight. You're likely to need to change stations in various cities with your luggage in tow.  
  
I love train travel. 4-6 hours is very relaxing, but you're talking about 15-18 hours of trains. Multiple changes, probably an overnight, what sounds like a large group, no thanks. Just fly, if you want real convenience, use LCY, not the other airports (unless you are already at one).  
  
As for hotels, in London avoid Hilton Park Lane, totally garbage hotel in a great neighborhood. Hilton Bankside is very nice, the neighborhood is ok, but close to lots of tourist things.  
  
In Paris, the Opera Hilton is ok. Beautiful old building, but not very up to date. Great location though.  
  
I've never stayed at a hotel in Italy, just Airbnb and agriturismo."
56,2020-02-02 20:04:12,exo2t3,Number of guests is strict in Europe. You would need to have any changes or exceptions confirmed in advance in writing.
57,2020-02-02 22:33:25,exo2t3,"If you are looking for something relaxing in London, there is a very nice Marriott property with a great spa and close to a nice park, not far from Heathrow airport - The Langley. Brand new (opened a year ago or so) and usually goes for $500 or so. In points though, it is just 35k per night.

In central London, Hilton Bankside is a very nice option, close to many attractions. I also stayed in Conrad but not sure if I want to stay there again at 95k points per night. Bankside is half as expensive as Conrad but no worse in terms quality."
58,2020-02-03 06:43:46,exo2t3,You take the piss more than a dialysis machine here.
59,2020-02-03 04:25:21,exo2t3,"I did a one-night stay in Hilton Park Lane last year and found it just fine, friendly staff, rooms small but adequate. Why do you have such a strong negative opinion of it?"
60,2020-02-03 14:03:26,exo2t3,That's what I thought I'd heard. Thanks.
61,2020-02-03 14:03:13,exo2t3,"Super, thank you."
62,2020-02-03 12:37:39,exo2t3,"Old furniture, especially the worn out mattress. Dirty stained carpet, drafty windows that were dripping with condensation (winter time), paper thin walls, and just generally not very clean. 
  
The view was good and the location was excellent. The staff was perfectly pleasant for the 1 minute I talked with them during check-in, but it doesn't really matter how nice they are when the hotel is a bit of a lot. I also don't understand that metric, but that's a different show.  
  
Small rooms don't bother me and I wouldn't call them small, even by US standards. The room was just a regular, old, dirty, drafty, Hilton. It's actually the stay that made me go free agent on hotels. I was diamond at the time, I realized hotel status just pins you to crappy hotels because of the name. I was much better off just picking the best hotel I'm the best area.  
  
I went way off topic, and perhaps I'm being a bit unfair to the property, but I won't stay there again. No need, I've been back to London nearly a dozen times and every hotel I've been to since has been better."
63,2020-02-03 12:42:52,exo2t3,"Wow! I was there this past November, and that sounds nothing at all like my experience."
64,2020-02-03 12:52:26,exo2t3,"I was there 3-4 years ago, can't remember. Maybe they've updated the rooms since, but even if they have, I won't stay there again. I'm bitter and hold a grudge longer than I should.  
  
Lots of great hotels in London, no need to try again."

**Translation #7:** ‚ÄúI‚Äôm actually socially primitive and this is why I‚Äôm even giving cancer like Paris Hilton any type of praise instead of destroying it like chemotherapy. Paris Hilton is as cancerous as Kim KarTRASHian waking up the next day and saying she wants to be a lawyer. YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY THINK ABOUT THESE THINGS, BUT PEOPLE THAT LIKE PARIS HILTON ARE NOT USING THEIR BRAINS TO CRITICALLY THINK. Supporting Paris Hilton is like supporting Adolf Hitler it he came back from the dead and was performing in Tel Aviv after he apologised, called Jews ‚Äústrong‚Äù, and donated $2,000,000 to some Israeli foundation and flashed huge fake grins (and also came from money and started hanging out with a bunch of random artists). Oh, and if anyone calls out how EVIL and RIDICULOUS that shit is, we‚Äôll just scream ‚ÄòSHUT UP!!!!!!!!!‚Äô/‚ÄòNO ONE CARES!!!!!!!!!!‚Äô/‚ÄòGET OVER IT!!!!!!!

Well, these cheapskates limit you to 2 packages of crackers with your bowl of chili, but today they had all sorts of delicious whole wheat crackers (very rare for this place). So I decided to stock up. As I'm stuffing my pockets with packages of crackers, one of the cafeteria worker ladies comes up to me and says, ""limit 2 packages per order of chili"", and I honestly flashed her the trollface... just to see what she would say and she said, ""didn't you hear me? i said 2 packages."" I kept the trollface strong and stood there like a statue. She said, ""i don't think you are understanding me."" and I just continued to trollface. She just turned around and left, and I walked off with my pockets fully lined with delicious wheat treats.. I checked out and took my extra 10 packages of crackers with me. I've never tried trollface in the workplace before, but I thought what better time than to try it on an hourly cafe worker? It worked surprisingly well, and I will now use it more often.

Thank God Neymar is not injured, and could play on, but I hope Kimpembe will be okay. Disgusting.

As for the referee, surely, he has had his feelings hurt recently. Some of his yellow cards were absolutely disgraceful, notably Neymar‚Äôs."

Still bad, yeah, but not as strong as it sounds. And second of all, fuck this ref, there is no excuse for a verbal warning for playing the game. Ref is deserving a son of a whore here.

They've addressed all their weak parts in their squad, and I think they can go toe-to-toe with anyone. Whether they win or not is a different issue, but they have a chance.

We'll see how their season goes and what happens over the summer window for both Neymar and Mbappe..."

But yeah I agree, I like him too, he seems much more confident than Emery around the pitch and he makes things click better (even though the absolute best PSG match I've ever seen was under Emery, too bad it was followed by the worst later), I'd just like if he tried to whine less during itws and press conferences."
125,2020-02-01 22:52:22,exaero,That's because he doesn't have that attitude in Clairefontaine

But I think most people would agree that the Biggest Loser's tactics are pretty horrible. Plus, not even effective long-term in keeping weight off and being healthy wrt to food and general health."

It might be a little bit of both."

But once you lose it, you have to keep living, and you're going to have to eat. 

One of the things I most appreciate is that I am learning how to deal with food in a way that will let me keep the weight off and keep me active and healthy.  Though, it must be said, I'm eating so well now I'm not sure how I'll eat all the food on maintenance!"
148,2020-01-29 23:50:45,evtdmw,"Although personally I feel like this show needs to go somewhere and die, I do think there is a market for it because a lot of people see dramatic weight loss like this is inspirational. Also, I recently got an email from my gym to be part of a ‚Äúbiggest loser‚Äù challenge so I think the methods used in the show have been internalized in a lot of different ways."
149,2020-01-29 22:45:40,evtdmw,"Arguably The Biggest Loser is damaging people's health in the name of improving it.  There is evidence that it is more dangerous to be on a gain/lose cycle (which for most people ends up with them gaining more weight at the end than they started at) as it messes up your metabolism permanently, than it is to just stay fat in the first place."

Tell her you want the divorce.

Sorry to day that your wife sounds like a narcissistic bitch. You should be happy she wants a divorce vs subjecting you to more of her crap."
194,2020-01-25 14:06:49,etqlyp,"Well, if you want to stay with her, then tell her that just because they're not her kids, doesn't mean they're not yours. If you can't spend money on your son, you won't spend money on hers. If you're spending $700 on her daughter, you're spending $700 on yours. No exceptions. 

However, i will add my personal opinion, so take this with a grain of salt and do with it what you will. Remember, this is just my opinion and by no means advice to tell you what to do. 
I don't like anyone who treats their partner's children like crap or like inconvenient byproducts of their partner's last relationship. People like that rarely learn to co-exist with those children and will never learn to accept them. As a mother and a parent she should understand that the children come first and that no child should recieve favoritism. She needs to understand that her children do not deserve to be treated better just because you're married to her. She should've understood that when getting into a relationship, let alone a marriage. Getting into a relationship means learning to either love or accept your partner's kids.

If things continue the way they do, it'll for sure create tension and distance between you and your kids and it for sure as hell is closing the distance between you and her kids. 

Let me ask you, what is the benefit of this relationship? Do you still love her? Can you continue to love her if you start to resent her kids? Can you accept that your kids might start distancing themselves from you if you continue the relationship? Can you keep living the way you have been? Do you think she'll change her mind and her ways? How much are you willing to accept before she cross a line? Most importanly, who comes first her or your kids? Personally, i would probably leave such a person. 

But if you're still adamant on staying with her, then i guess get a separate bank account and say that she should spend her money on her kids and you spend your money on yours."
195,2020-01-25 14:16:39,etqlyp,What did you never see in this piece of shit of a woman. Why would you treat your kids like this?

200,2020-01-25 15:30:43,etqlyp,"What the fuck are you doing? Is this a scenario pitch for Cinderella 2? Divorce the fucking cow, Jesus Christ!"
201,2020-02-16 16:39:25,etqlyp,"Well, first $400 for a prom dress is quite expensive, so setting a proper budget for anything and everything seems wise.  Second, her insistence that only half should be paid for your kids and the other half by their mother is petty, unless the implication is that they should earn the other half of the money, and then it‚Äôs responsible, but the latter doesn‚Äôt sound like the case.  If she only thinks you should pay half for your kids, perhaps she should only pay half for hers.  But, they are all grown or mostly grown.  She needs to cut the apron strings on her kids and let them fend for themselves, just as you should really only focus on the issues surrounding your minor child.  If you want to help college-bound kids who are still dependents, again you and your wife need to set budgetary expectations and ground rules.  Put the frustration of the bedrooms behind you; that is water under the bridge.  If you are interested in salvaging this marriage focus on the present and the future.  And try to remember that kids grow up and leave you, but a wife theoretically is permanent in your life.  So, you both need to prioritize each other over any kids.  Edit: I would add to the comment of budgeting that you could designate a certain amount to clothes and  let the kids for themselves decide how it is spent.  That way if they want an extravagant prom dress they can splurge, but they, too, learn about budgeting and understanding that expensive stuff comes at the general expense of other things they want."
202,2020-01-25 13:25:16,etqlyp,TLDR
203,2020-01-25 14:12:06,etqlyp,"This. My first thought reading about the cars and dresses and shoes and money AFTER the bs his wife pulled when she moved in was: she's a narcissistic shrew, and he cares more about rehashing the wrongs of the past with his ex wife than maintaining the relationship with his kids. Frankly, almost all these kids are adults, time to just move on from this dumpster fire and let OP and his wife have each other; they kind of deserve it."
204,2020-01-25 21:30:45,etqlyp,"Yeah, the fact that she sounds like a one-dimensional character from a children's story suggests to me this is either a fake story, or that she's a real person and OP wants to paint her in the worst light possible. If it's the latter, it makes me wonder (1) what this story would sound like from her perspective, and (2) why OP stayed with someone for so long if he only feels contempt for them."
205,2020-01-25 14:14:23,etqlyp,"Honestly Op, you‚Äôre lucky you still even have relationships with your kids anymore."

also; I would absolutely love to see KSHMR as he is maybe my favourite DJ atm. The thing is that TML has their own show and therefore don't really allow KSHMR to tell his own story there.

Just to give an example, take this hardwell closing at ultra Europe: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPZphNUqi10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPZphNUqi10)

Do you think they just randomly had perfectly-mapped pokemon visuals? Of course all of this is pre-programmed."

225,2020-01-24 12:05:47,et9atk,i just got burned down for saying this in an other post. Guess they have some fanboys after all.
226,2020-01-24 12:10:00,et9atk,"I just finished listening to their top 5 songs on spotify (skipped through paris hilton) and Mattn‚Äôs songs arent that bad at all so I ask you again, why? 


I also just realized paris hilton made best friends ass. The others songs were also similar to that. Agreed that she is probably the worst on tml.



Edit: typos"
227,2020-01-24 12:28:31,et9atk,"Agreed on Paris Hilton. Just realized what songs she made and yeah that‚Äôs a real shame.

Mattn‚Äôs songs (top 5 on spotify at least) are quite good. But it‚Äôs clear that the reason she is hated isn‚Äôt the music itself"
228,2020-01-24 17:30:10,et9atk,iirc he didnt played the movie during his set last year right? Gotta agree with you on that part tho. It really disrupts the vibes
229,2020-01-24 22:26:34,et9atk,"I agree 100%. Afrojack said it too, you cant really improvise if your set is being watched by THAT many people. Even though he likes to dj live, people pay big money to go see him. And 80% of that is mainstream audience. They want to hear ten feet tall, and if he just goes free styling he might forget to play it. Interesting stuff to say the least.

But I think we're just confirming each other's points :)"
230,2020-01-24 12:48:23,et9atk,"Dw mate, I see ya."
231,2020-01-24 12:23:54,et9atk,"For starters, she‚Äôs an ass DJ, who is only booked because she‚Äôs married to Dimitri Vegas - she‚Äôs also completely ghost-produced, a fraud in general."
232,2020-01-24 13:08:31,et9atk,"They didn't even produce those songs. They bought them. The whole reason they are ""DJs"" is because they paid to be. It's complete bullshit and a spit in the face of all,the other real DJs who worked thier asses off to be on that position"
233,2020-01-24 12:38:12,et9atk,"The reason she's hated is because, from what I've seen/heard, she uses ghost producers, puts in no effort in her sets, uses pre-made sets all the time, when she doesn't, it's atrocious, only gets her bookings because of her husband,...

Literally the female DVLM, who catch a shit-tonne of hate as well."
234,2020-01-24 17:40:56,et9atk,Last I've been to TML (and was at his show) was 2017
235,2020-01-24 22:43:35,et9atk,"Yeah, I know I'm kicking in open doors here. But I find it weird when people discuss mixing skills in the context of the mainstage. I can't post a link here because it's automatically blocked, but there's a youtube video of hardwell closing ultra europe with a pokemon theme song and all the visuals are perfectly mapped pokemon visuals. Does anybody expect this to be spontaneous and the crew just had these laying around in case someone played the pokemon theme song? :p. It's not a secret this is all pre-programmed. The people on the mainstage have a spot there earned in their previous lives. Their current lives is just showmanship."

238,2020-01-24 22:49:05,et9atk,"At big events its for some people showmanship, absolutely. It does depend on the artist though, afrojack had [this](https://youtu.be/YAD1gCeYzoQ) to say about it"
239,2020-01-24 13:41:16,et9atk,"I don't know if that was what you were implying, but every so often somebody feels the need to opine that everyone who dislikes MATTN does so because they're misogynistic and she's a successful, attractive woman in a male-dominated industry, so I thought I'd explain some arguments. 

That's of course sidestepping the fact that there's the aforementioned multitude of musical reasons not to like her.

It's also sidestepping the fact that Charlotte de Witte, Amelie Lens, Nora en Pure, Nina Kraviz, Ida Engberg, Nicole Moudaber, Alison Wonderland, Deborah de Luca,... are also (imo) very attractive women in the same industry, but they do in general get lots of love. Hell, Ida Engberg is *also* married to a leading DJ in their genre. 

Just take Charlotte de Witte, who started DJ'ing as Raving George because then people would think she's a man and have less reservations about booking her, playing small local scouts parties until she got her break at local festivals/radio contests, building up her reputation, switching genres, switching names, have her own successful party concept and ending up hosting your own stage at TML. 

That's a whole separate level than ""I wanted to be a DJ, so I had my husband produce some songs, throw together some sets and get me bookings. To this day, I still struggle getting booked without him being involved to a large extent""."
240,2020-01-24 14:33:34,et9atk,"No I was just honestly wondering why they were both so hated. Music wise I understand why people hate Paris Hilton, but Mattn‚Äôs just sounds like plenty of other mainstream music. Didn‚Äôt imply anything with it because I don‚Äôt know if the story is true, but yeah with Mattn it sounds like hate is coming more from a point of view where people think other dj deserve it more which I can get behind."
241,2020-01-24 20:07:53,et9atk,Nicole Moudaber is supposedly ghost-produced as well tbf
242,2020-01-24 21:13:54,et9atk,"That's very possible, idk. I'm always slightly ticked by ghost producing, just leave it in their name but with rights belonging to you.

It's so unnecessary as well, Carl Cox or Black Coffee are world famous/renowned and don't have a single hit song."

264,2020-01-24 01:21:28,eswxy2,"Britney Spears is no longer performing. From a May 2019 [Variety article ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/variety.com/2019/music/news/britney-spears-may-never-perform-again-manager-says-1203215676/amp/) 

""Britney Spears‚Äôs longtime manager¬†Larry Rudolph says the singer may never perform again. 

Speaking to¬†TMZ, Rudolph said, ‚ÄúAs the person who guides her career ‚Äî based on the information I and all of the professionals who work with her are being told on a need-to-know basis ‚Äî from what I have gathered it‚Äôs clear to me she should not be going back to do this Vegas residency, not in the near future and possibly never again.‚Äù

Rudolph has managed Spears for most of her career, going back to her first album, ‚ÄúBaby‚Ä¶ One More Time,‚Äù in 1999. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been with her for two-thirds of her life,‚Äù he tells¬†Variety. ‚ÄúI look at her almost like I look at my own daughter. It‚Äôs very emotional for me ‚Ä¶ and really rough. Personally, I want for her to just find a peaceful, happy place ‚Äî whatever that means for her. It‚Äôs not about a career anymore ‚Äî it‚Äôs about life.‚Äù"
265,2020-01-24 02:10:03,eswxy2,I see her at my gym. She looks like she‚Äôs always stressed which is sad. I wish her bodyguard would let people approach her just so I can tell her to hang in there.
266,2020-01-23 18:20:14,eswxy2,Thanks for compiling this all. Her situation has always saddened and interested me.
267,2020-01-23 22:54:01,eswxy2,What the hell is up with her boyfriend? Their interactions on Britney's instagram are VERY strange. Is this what you're referencing with men  being paid to date her?
268,2020-01-23 18:51:26,eswxy2,"I believe people have used and abused her over the years. Theres a video from the height of her fame where she is running from the paps and trying to get into a car and she asks the person she's with to help her and her friend doesn't and allows the paps to swarm her. 

It later transpires that alot of her trusted people from that time would tip off the media whenever she was out in public. I think its really sad."
269,2020-01-23 18:58:36,eswxy2,"Hold up, I didn‚Äôt know Jamie claimed she had dementia!? Isn‚Äôt that a pretty shockingly insane claim for a 38-year-old who can competently preform complicated dance routines and songs for a live audience on a nightly basis? Was there ever any apparent reason for this claim? Or was it just a way for them to continue the general conservatorship indefinitely, as opposed to an LPS conservatorship for mental illness which has a strict time frame?"
270,2020-01-23 19:33:12,eswxy2,Naming the father the conservator in the first place was a horrible idea. If she needed to have one she should have fought to be able to hire a top 20 national lawfirm to handle it.
271,2020-01-23 19:01:18,eswxy2,"I heard on another podcast that as part  of her conservatorship Britney isn't even allowed to vote. How is that constitutional?? The fact that she is supposedly well enough to have a Las Vegas residency but not well enough to exercise her civil rights is pretty disturbing. 

She clearly has mental health issues and needs guidance. However,  the people who have the conservatorship over her   are profiting off it. Why hasnt the court appointed an advocate for her? An independent party who isnt making money off of her?"
272,2020-01-24 00:13:01,eswxy2,"Okay first of all, this is my favorite post on this sub. Ever. I can talk about 90's pop stars all day and rarely get the opportunity, so thank you again OP for this wonderful post. 

Disclaimer, I am not Britney, I do not know Britney, I do not know anyone in her immediate circle. I'm a few degrees of separation from her.

I first heard the dementia rumors in the fall of 2017. I don't think it's true - I take care of people who are in various stages of Alzheimer's and dementia. I'm pretty okay at spotting the signs, I guess, and I just don't see it with her. 

Her life has been a trainwreck from toddlerhood. As soon as her parents started putting the pieces together and realized they might be able to profit from her, it was pretty much over for Britney. That entire Mickey Mouse Club crew was definitely marketed to the wrong kind of adult. Her solo career was tailor made and that crossed over into her entire life - her relationship with JT was arranged and ended terribly for her and he still can't let it go. 

Sometime in 2007, before the head shaving incident, there was a legit breakdown. Sort of a combo of some homegrown mental illness, stress from her entire life imploding, a terrible childhood, more drugs than anyone has any business doing, and add on heaps of postpartum depression. We're lucky we didn't lose her and I honestly believe the only reason she's still here is because she can't be unsupervised. 

She has 24/7 caregivers. She can't be unsupervised. Everything she does is tightly monitored and controlled - no alone time, no reading her own mail, no making any decisions for herself. 

Because she can't. Whatever happened during that big episode has rendered her unable to care for herself. The best, kindest thing for her would be to put her in a home she lives in by herself far away from the spotlight, but her shitass family knows they can still make some money so that's not happening. 

Her family is GROSS. Stage parents are gross. They set her up for failure from the start. That's such a rabbit hole to go down because her sister is also a hot mess and her brother got into some weird trouble years back. 

As far as the Free Britney movement goes, I think her friends pushed for it until they realized how dire her situation was and they realized shouting it from the mountaintops wouldn't really help Britney."

275,2020-01-23 23:24:40,eswxy2,"I'm a huge Britney fan so I'm sure that makes me biased, but from what I understand a 13 year conservatorship is VERY unusual. Typically conservatorships last a year or two at most. I think we have seen enough celebrities (and average joes) that have been given free reign to completely destroy their lives without the courts approving a conservatorship, so it's strange to me that they have allowed this one to go on this long, especially while shes been able to work. I dont have any theories other than her father is involved in possibly paying off these judges to keep it going. It reminds me a lot of the judge that kept Meek Mill on probation for like a decade to fulfill some weird obsession she had with him. 

I feel so bad for her. She is a grown woman that hasn't ever really had a normal life to begin with and then to have any hint of normalcy stripped away from her is very sad to me. I know she has had mental health issues, but that isn't really anything out of the ordinary for many people and it doesnt necessarily mean she is not competent to be in charge of her own life. I just hope she gets the support she needs to get out from under her dads thumb. Leave the poor woman alone and let her live!"
276,2020-01-23 18:59:47,eswxy2,"Yes, I‚Äôm here for this content! Grew up on her and I remember when the whole head shaving incident happened and so many jokes were made about her (even continuing today) instead of genuine concern for this human being that is clearly losing her mind, everyone laughed at her. Heart breaking."
277,2020-01-24 14:50:31,eswxy2,"I suppose a contrast to this is the Amanda Bynes case, where conservatorship of person and of estate (in other words, over both her healthcare and finances) started with her breakdowns in 2013.  

By 2016, however, her mother petitioned to REMOVE the financial aspect (Conservatorship of Estate) of the conservatorship because she was doing better and her mother only kept control over her healthcare. Which seems like a big contrast to Britney's case."
278,2020-01-24 03:03:49,eswxy2,"Saw this when I was at work earlier and was unable to say anything until it had blown up with comments.  I expect this to be buried, but nonetheless, I feel compelled to get this out.

For those of us with mental illness, this right here is why many of us are deeply afraid of treatment when things hit the fan.

Mental illness can mean losing the right to every possible legal decision in your life.  And once it happens, it's nearly impossible to get it to stop.  It requires being able to prove that you are medically stable.  

Well, mental illness, all mental illnesses, is a chronic, physical, neurological problem.  This is without a doubt proven with modern medical science and the use of FMRI'S and DNA studies.  Stable, for us, never can mean it's not coming back.  Chronic illnesses don't work that way.

Because of this exact problem, a lot of very ill people avoid appropriate medical care.  This, of course, leads to them getting worse.

I openly admit that I am so hard on myself about maintaining my own mental health not because I am scared of how bad I get, but because I am terrified of losing the right to make my own decisions.

Historically, this was regularly used as a way to handle the ""problematic"" family member.  Only difference is Brittany is out in the public instead of  in an asylum.  

I pity the poor woman deeply.  She is a cash cow who's family is continually using her and blaming it on a medical condition.  And due to the nature of the laws surrounding conservatorship and mental illness, it is highly unlikely she will ever be able to get out of it."
279,2020-01-23 18:40:26,eswxy2,"I really believe child stars are basically sold off by their parents. I've seen too many batshit crazy child stars locked in mental hospitals while their parents spend the money they made. They usually get committed in the same hospitals, too. There is a huge physical, emotional and sexual abuse problem in the entertainment industry and it's largely the parents fault, in my opinion."

Drug and mental health issues led him to be in an abusive conservatorship for something close to two decades!  He was kept drugged out on pharmaceuticals and largely sequestered by his own psychiatrist, who reaped the financial rewards of the situation."
282,2020-01-23 21:01:57,eswxy2,"Her dad is certainly trouble, but so is Sam Lufti. In fact, Sam Lufti is the bigger creep between the two, and I do think he wrote the letters in question, especially since the letters are in the third person."
283,2020-01-23 22:29:56,eswxy2,"I‚Äôm a lawyer that has done a decent amount of work in the guardian / conservator area. 

At the time the conservatorship was put in place, it made some sense. You have a world famous musician seeming to throw her career and ‚Äúbrand‚Äù away in the public‚Äôs eyes while suffering what appears to be mental illness. We can debate if it was a good idea to name her dad or not, but generally courts prefer to name a close relative rather than a stranger. 

However, fast forward a couple of years and that‚Äôs when I start scratching my head in amazement that the conservatorship is still in place. She does a tour and stays out of trouble. I don‚Äôt see how a judge could keep that conservatorship in place if it has recently come up for a hearing. Obviously the dad has an incentive to keep it in place, but most judges would order an independent evaluation before renewing it. I don‚Äôt practice in any state Brittany lives, but I suspect that this conservatorship will be lifted in the not too distant future."

There‚Äôs also that time Britney recorded a secret album, went to a radio station in la and just said ‚Äúplay this.‚Äù And had them play this song about her wanting to break free and get away and how she‚Äôs being controlled. Her record label shut that shit down so fast. It wasn‚Äôt played again, it‚Äôs not on any of her albums but if you go digging online you can find it. He also talked about how around the time Britney came out, she was competing with Jessica Simpson and (more importantly) Christina Aguilera who had a very distinct sound. The conspiracy is that they needed Britney to have her own sound as well, to stand out and be relevant, so they made her sing in that nasally baby voice she‚Äôs so well known for today. However, doing that voice for so long was really hard on her vocal cords and the theory is that‚Äôs why she no longer sings live. It‚Äôs no secret that Britney lip synchs, and I think people usually assume it‚Äôs because she has so much dancing in her shows but what if it‚Äôs actually because she‚Äôs damaged her vocal cords? There‚Äôs videos of her singing when she was younger and she sounded SO much like Christina. Her voice was deep and powerful but someone already had that sound... honestly it‚Äôs probably one of the most believable conspiracy theories out there to me. I think a LOT of fucked up shit happened to her, she‚Äôs got severe mental health problems because of it. I love Britney so much. I always have and I always will. But some terrible, terrible things I‚Äôm sure we can‚Äôt even fathom have definitely happened to her."

295,2020-01-23 20:30:52,eswxy2,"On the head shaving incident:

If you look closely at her hair there are small patches of glue quite close to her scalp. She had extensions in. They need lots of upkeep, I‚Äôm sure that she was expected to sit there and get them re-done more often than most to ensure perfection. On top of that she was a new mom. It‚Äôs very common for moms to feel ‚Äútouched out‚Äù and even develop aversions to being touched. The baby constantly wants you, your body is their comfort, your husband wants affection. You feel tired, drained, and want to be left alone. Add onto that the paparazzi and the need for constant maintenance. Shaving her head was an absolutely sane move and she was treated horribly for it.

The umbrella incident:

If some man was chasing me, portraying me as insane, causing me to fear losing custody of my kids, and making me fear for my safety. Bet your ass I would lose it. It was self defense. 

The conservatorship is bizarre and concerning. It seems like she is being forced to perform constantly for the benefit of those controlling her. I follow her instagram, it seems carefully managed in a somewhat creepy way."

The fact that she‚Äôs been going through this her entire life is horrible."
305,2020-01-23 21:21:03,eswxy2,"Thanks for bringing this up--I think it deserves more discussion, because even though it is a painful personal issue, it has serious implications that need to be dealt with.

I doubt I've looked into this as deeply as you have, so I may be wrong, but here is my take:

The conservatorship has continued for such a shockingly long time because Britney is far more unstable than they want to acknowledge, such that any moment something major can happen. This has always seemed obvious to me--they won't even let her talk most of the time, and absolutely do micromanage her in creepy ways (selecting her boyfriends), etc. This raises major ethical issues that should get more attention, but since we don't know the details of her condition, it is tough to discuss. Even if the goal was controlling her money and all that, I feel like the effort put into controlling her daily life is so extreme that it is likely based in severe and chronic mental health issues, but it doesn't necessarily justify that interference. Her position is a disturbing one, and when they promote her career and performances, it looks much creepier. It is unprecedented to have this go on so long with someone so prominent.

That said, I can believe that the structure of performing in a place like Vegas (not touring) majorly stabilizes her. There are also legal reasons to be so controlling--they're able to fend off lawsuits and other things that she wracked up during her troubles and probably since, as long as she's not legally responsible.

And then there are the kids. I don't think she'd be able to see them if the conservatorship expired, and that's the main reason it is in place. She has never had meaningful custody--Kevin allows her to see them as long as she is monitored by someone with authority over her, and relatively stable, and DCFS approves of this. I had thought many of the issues related to DCFS were about choices that were objectionable but somewhat understandable, given her upbringing, fame, and instability--letting a baby ride on her lap in the car, or drink mountain dew, or something like that. I don't think she felt that was wrong. I figured once the kids were older, these things would no longer be an issue. The fact that she is still so monitored when around them leads me to believe that something more severe is going on. Their efforts to dodge this issue just make the whole thing appear more devious, but I think it is probably based in a real need and good intentions. But the power and situation is so easily abused that it is disturbing, and it does look bad. I think once the kids turn 18, it will be different, and a lot harder to justify.

The situation is creepy, but I think the doctor's death is a coincidence, and the stuff with the bodyguards is unsurprising. Her fame, money, and problems make her a magnet for leeches and exploiters, and she's far from alone in this. It's one of the complicating factors, but I don't think it is a major conspiracy."

322,2020-01-23 20:08:52,eswxy2,"I haven't followed this super close but I do follow along in gossip groups when this comes up. I've seen a few insta videos she's posted in the last year and honestly she doesn't seem well, she seems almost unaware of herself if that makes sense. Other people have also pointed out how she continues to style and dress herself like she's still in the mid 2000s. Now that in itself doesn't necessarily point to mental illness, she could just really love those fashion choices or it makes her nostalgic for her days in peak popularity but it does contribute to her whole ""off"" vibe."
323,2020-01-24 16:54:15,eswxy2,"I've followed her in my teens, and I think the answer is a simple, and rather harrowing one. it all comes down to keeping her silent. And I think she's been abused all her life.

Look at how Britney's life on stage started. She was in gymnastics class, then in Mickey Mouse Club. Her parents were pushing her onto the performance/fame stage, and no doubt Jamie also. They banked on Britney or Jamie Spears becoming famous and being the family cash cow. Of course, we all know what happened in 1999; she caught onto the pop music popularity bandwagon and went from teenager in high school to stage sensation almost overnight. *She was still a kid,* for all intents and purposes, and now suddenly she had millions in the bank.

It's enough to turn any kid's head. We've all seen what happens when child stars hit their teens/young adult years. Self-destruction is guaranteed, because they hadn't been given any real limits/structure in their formative period and instead had millions of dollars thrown at them for that one movie they made, or the modeling photos that were suddenly getting them trips to Europe every other week, or that song that went gold/platinum/diamond. Without structure, you lose yourself really quickly.

Yes, Britney had that meltdown in 2007. Everyone made fun of her, but I knew even then that she just plain *had enough* of being the performing puppet for everyone. But I found it *really* slick that her father chose *that exact moment* to step in and do a conservatorship. On one hand, it's obvious she was sick and tired of being the stage puppet. A good parent would've said, ""OK, you're taking time off, don't come onstage until you're ready"". This guy steps in and strips her of all her legal rights.

You can argue that he was ""just looking out for her"". Was he? I don't think so. I think he was protecting his investment. I think he was doing this to cuff her hand and foot and prevent her from stopping the money flow - was she going to cut him off financially? - and undermine her credibility for the rest of her life. Nice ""parent"" right there.

I don't think her father was looking out for her. It makes one ask just what he was doing to her that he would want to institutionalize and silence her this effectively.

Britney Spears is roughly my age by now. 35ish. She's been betrayed by a lot of people, trusts little, and is exhausted from having to constantly be on stage. She's had her heyday and wants to have some sort of a normal life, and nobody can blame her. But her father is still insisting of having full control of her at 35? Why?

Something very, very horrible is happening to her, and her father is behind it. My guess is that he may have molested her, and has for a while. He is keeping her under conservatorship to keep her muzzled and not making waves, and threatens her with the kids to ensure it."

Her mother sold her out. 
Her boyfriend wrote a hit song and made a music video that told the entire world she cheated on him. Then he went on to be a sleaze to his own wife. But hey, think of all the money he made off Cry Me a River. 
She had that dude Sam Lufti drugging her and controlling her. Yeah her Dad might not be perfect but this entire post leaves out that when she estranged herself from both her parents, Sam Lufti was drugging her and selling her out. The whole reason Jamie got involved wasnt because of her breakdown, it was because of trying to save her from Sam. 

It's easy to assume her father is controlling her and that it is all about money. Think deeper. He kept her busy. That's not a bad thing. He kept her working. He kept her safe from people preying on her, INCLUDING her mother. There are reports her mother is STILL selling her out constantly. 

I wouldn't be surprised if she does have dementia. Theres no telling what the drugs Sam was putting in her drinks did to her brain. I feel bad for her, she has always had a sadness to her, from the very beginning of her career. She doesnt hide it, the media does."

340,2020-01-23 19:06:52,eswxy2,"The news article suggests that her physician, Dr Benson, died of an aneurysm, presumably a cerebral berry aneurysm that ruptured. That's a specific and very plausible way to die for a 48-year-old, and not one that could be induced or simulated.

We can joke all we want about Britney's hair-chopping episode, but mental illness is no joke.  People with real schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder cannot function in any way while unmedicated, and they often attempt to discontinue their medications.  Either Britney has one of these conditions, in which case the love and support that enables her to go on performing is amazing; or she's being involuntarily restrained with heavy psychotropic medications as part of a conspiracy to siphon her wealth away from her.  My guess is the former; it's less interesting but seems more likely.

As a counterpoint, I once dated a girl whose brother was in the process of developing full-fledged schizophrenia.  He would stay away from home for weeks at a time, come back complaining of being infested by imaginary parasites.  He couldn't keep his attention on one thing for more than a minute or two.  He would become violent if any attempt was made to redirect his attention from his paranoid delusions, once striking his elderly father (who ironically enough was a child psychologist) in the face.  Meds worked - I once took him to the pharmacy where it took two hours to get him to consent to pick up his Risperdal - but he wouldn't keep them more than a day or so, always flushing them down the toilet.   

When his father developed dementia severe enough to interfere with what caregiving the son would accept, the son went wild for a few months.  Eventually he was incarcerated, first in county jail, then the state hospital for the criminally insane, where he remains several years later.  There was nothing to do about it; it would have taken a team of eight healthy, strong people working round the clock to keep this guy's life manageable, and that simply wasn't available."

357,2020-01-23 20:05:05,eswxy2,"I'm just goona play devils advocate here for a second.  How many of these types of cases end in tragic over doses and suicide before they even reach 30?

Brittney was clearly having a really tough time and understandably so.  Perhaps from the outside this all seems completely out of control and unnecessary, but at the end of the day is it not to be partially seen as a bit of a success?

She has a steady gig in Vegas doing what she loves, or did at one point at least. She isn't getting into trouble with the law, isn't seen hammered and coked up at 3am in nightclubs.

Perhaps while seemly over bearing it is what she actually needs right now.  38 isn't exactly old and wise, especially if you've never really had to live a normal adult life, since she was 14 or so people have done all that stuff for her.  She may not be able to function without this massive support network controlling her every move.

She could have easily been a member of the 27 club."
358,2020-01-23 23:42:50,eswxy2,Get this shit on the front page
359,2020-01-23 23:14:48,eswxy2,South Park covered the whole ordeal a lot more accurately than any other media source IMO
360,2020-01-24 15:28:02,eswxy2,"I‚Äôve always thought this was fishy from the start and I never understood why the media always treated it like this great thing. When you think of monstrous stage parents like Judy Garland‚Äôs mom and Joe Jackson having complete control of the children they‚Äôve exploited, it‚Äôs horrifying, but for some reason Jamie Spears gets a free pass."
361,2020-01-24 17:02:49,eswxy2,"Here‚Äôs the [court document](https://twitter.com/meanerthree/status/1168889159215439873?s=21) that shows how the petitioner illegally obtained the initial temporary CONservatorship by claiming Britney has ‚Äúdementia‚Äù.  

Once they filed for the permanent CONservatorship, suddenly this ‚Äúdementia‚Äù claim was no longer checked off (because they would have needed a diagnosis.) [link](https://twitter.com/meanerthree/status/1168889270943322113?s=21)"

364,2020-01-24 05:04:46,eswxy2,"I've always felt bad for her. She was a child star, forced into the spotlight. I obviously dont know her personally but I get a vibe that she really just wanted a normal life and doesnt really like performing."
365,2020-01-24 05:37:40,eswxy2,"Honestly, she was micromanaged by her parents from childhood so of course they'll pill her up and push her onto a stage, despite her ill health, just so they can make money. Then use her ill health to stake a claim that they need to be her legal carers and get a slice of the pie.

The ""buying boyfriends"" thing sounds a lot like the rumours I've heard over the years about the Kardashian clan buying boys to date Kendall Jenner to hide her homosexuality, or Taylor Swift allegedly doing the same over the years."
366,2020-01-24 06:13:51,eswxy2,Good post.  Not every mystery is a murder.
367,2020-01-24 06:38:28,eswxy2,Did anyone ever watch that Courtney Cox show called Dirt? There is a whole playout of the Britney saga from the stance of the paps following her. It is very true to her life looking back at it. Very tragic.
368,2020-01-24 14:48:41,eswxy2,"Oof. This sounds like what happened to Brian Wilson from The Beach Boys. If you're curious about situations similar to Britney's in the music industry, go watch Brian's biopic ""Love and Mercy"". A genuinely incredible film about a genuinely inhumane situation."

I'm super sorry."
371,2020-01-23 20:02:52,eswxy2,"Hollywood and the entertainment industry are like US politics, if someone makes money they can either get away with anything or can be controlled and milked dry until they die and then they collect royalties."
372,2020-01-24 03:03:39,eswxy2,"Whoever has control over Britney, is failing miserably. They need to control the content she posts on IG. 

I have loved her from day one, since she was a small town little celebrity in Louisiana, and we grew up just one parish apart. But lawd, her posts make me uncomfortable. But I can‚Äôt stop watching."
373,2020-01-23 19:18:26,eswxy2,and let's address the fact that her own father was marketing her to pedophiles at the beginning of her career. She was a child. Disgusting.
374,2020-01-23 22:19:26,eswxy2,its so sad whats happened to britney i hope she finds a professional conservator like a lawyer not her family she reminds me of my ex his family controls his every move he used to have a stable job and happy now hes addicted to meth and homeless
375,2020-01-24 02:12:09,eswxy2,"Britney‚Äôs story has always depressed the hell out of me. Money and fame are dangerous. Once you become so rich that you‚Äôre so many people‚Äôs only source of income, you lose control over your own life. To think of all the nights she spent going through the motions and performing over and over again is crazy. Same thing happened to Avicii. Wanted to stop performing and be out of the public eye, but no one on his team would let it happen."
376,2020-01-24 04:23:41,eswxy2,I feel so bad for her. She was the it girl for so long. When I was growing up every one of my friends looked up to her and now I don‚Äôt know if kids today really know the impact of her music.
377,2020-01-24 14:20:45,eswxy2,Can I just jump into Britney's Gram at the latest episode or is this the kind of podcast I need to listen to from the beginning?
378,2020-01-24 14:29:39,eswxy2,Why would the judge appoint a neutral executor to her conservatorship ? Seems like family members would be in a conflict of interest.
379,2020-01-24 15:04:04,eswxy2,A conservator wouldn‚Äôt be able to make decisions like putting her in a mental health facility. The conservator only makes financial decisions. It sounds like someone has guardianship over her health and made that decision for her. I wonder if her father is also her guardian?
380,2020-01-24 15:15:24,eswxy2,Any number of well off people have been manipulated like this. Its frighteningly common. Although its usually more of an elder abuse issue.
381,2020-01-23 20:02:24,eswxy2,"I remember seeing an interview with Britney where she talked about performing and how it makes her feel alive and gave her a feeling of doing what she was put on earth to do. 

During the interview, it was the only time she lit up and actually had some life behind those dead eyes of hers. 

That's when it made sense that this is why her father allows her to keep performing. All the comments that her parents are just putting her out there to continue earning money doesn't really make sense. 

In that same interview/documentary you saw how much work her father had to put in to managing her and watching over her, and how he basically had to give up his businesses and his own life to do so. 

It looked draining and didn't look like someone who was half-assing it just for the fun of controlling her and cashing in on a big check."
382,2020-01-23 23:20:00,eswxy2,"No. It is not time. People need to understand that Courts don't do this randomly. There is a wealth of information they have (that you don't) about her decision-making capacity. That's why she's still under conservatorship and will remain so. 

Knowledge source: I am an attorney and I litigate guardianships (though not in CA)."
383,2020-01-23 21:07:16,eswxy2,Whenever I see her IG videos or recent pictures I can't believe she is in her late 30's she looks 50. I bet its all the stress and abuse she has been going through. I feel so sorry for her she hasn't had any kind of life not a childhood or adulthood where she has any control.
384,2020-01-23 20:01:02,eswxy2,Nice write up! Unfortunately I think most people groomed to be super stars endure some sort of abuse from those that are close to them. Some can break the cycle (Example Beyonce firing her father) and some cannot.
385,2020-01-24 00:35:55,eswxy2,"There are lots of conspiracies around her.

I think the most likely situation is that she wanted to quit. She wanted to quit Hollywood, get married to a trusted childhood friend, move home and raise her sons all while living a normal life.

Her father and all of her handlers couldn't let the gravy boat go. They wouldn't get paid anymore.

A conservatorship for someone in a coma or with dementia is one thing. A conservatorship for someone going through an acute mental breakdown is a little harder to get but it's normally short lived. A conservatorship for someone healthy enough to work is unheard of."
386,2020-01-24 01:50:33,eswxy2,"I'm glad this is gaining attention. Britney has been used and abused since her parents pushed her to be famous as a child. She was absolutely massive but then everything just crumbled till the point she had no friends and ended up confiding in the paparazzi...who didn't give a shit and sold her out. There are videos of Britney trying to go for a walk with her dog but the paparazzi swarm her and she ends up sitting back on the curb crying for everyone to leave her alone. It's heartbreaking.

Imagine going through this breakdown with the whole world watching and laughing at her. She was mocked by us, the public and the media. Nobody was helping her. The only people who ""helped"" her was her dad & team...for their gains and paychecks...not for Britneys sake 

Her family and team don't give a shit about her happiness (they'll grant her something that will make her happy if it aligns with their beliefs/plans)

She's clearly a different person to who she was a decade ago...and I don't mean she's grown up etc...but her mind and personality has been severely damaged.

I don't understand how the media aren't talking about this more. It might sounds too far, but I don't know how she's still alive. If I went through a fraction of what she's experienced...I would have opted out of life.

The public are the only ones who can help this by talking about it.

#freebritney"
387,2020-01-24 12:13:25,eswxy2,Apparently over the years she's tried to subtly reach out to people who aren't part of the conservatorship that she's worked with. One man on Twitter mentioned working with her on a music video and at one point she managed to get him to the side and she started saying something to him when a bodyguard showed up. She literally can't even create new friends or ask people for help.
388,2020-01-23 19:52:46,eswxy2,"I was very invested in this when it was all going down and I think many people have forgotten or are unaware of how bad off she really was.

She was signing over her bank accounts to random unscrupulous individuals who were bleeding her dry and she lost a HUGE chunk of money .. nearly broke and close to bankruptcy. She was also giving it away, buying huge gifts for people, partying, buying drugs, huge shopping sprees, random trips just to go tanning and party at some exotic location, buying random animals and then getting rid of them later .. wash, rinse, repeat.

She would refuse to bathe or change clothes for days or weeks at a time, she was driving around with Paris and Lohan flashing her vagina with no panties. She was constantly walking around barefoot in public and hanging out in gas stations, aimlessly driving around. Her skin was breaking out badly, she was losing her hair.

She got into several altercations with paparazzi.

Would walk around crying or do odd things for attention. Such as laying in the hallway on the floor of her hotel lobby for several hours and refusing to get up until her boyfriend came back and saw her.

She was engaging in promiscuous sex with several random guys who were using her. She literally grabbed a paparazzi guy off the street by the hand and told him to come into the hotel room with her.

She put her children in danger multiple times .. riding around with them on her lap with no seat belt, she almost dropped them, she was having a mental breakdown and locked herself in the bathroom and refused to hand the children over.

She was suicidal and of course everyone knows about the head shaving .. and the umbrella, and the random strange wigs, videos, performances she insisted on immediately after.

Her dad really saved her life and turned things around for her. She got checked into the mental hospital, sobered up, got put on meds, he cut her off from almost everyone who was using her, she lost the ability to spend her money frivolously and give it away, she lost custody of her children which was in their best interest at the time. Her dad did put her back to work to build up her income that she lost so that she would not lose her lifestyle and could still support her children. The traveling tours may have been too much but perhaps were necessary.

Over the years she has gotten more freedom, but behind the scenes she's still pretty bad off. She was just in the mental hospital again last year for 3 months because she had another break down which she admitted and said that the hospital stay was for her own good on her instagram. She likely does not have the maturity or mental capacity to handle many adult things in her life without messing up too bad.

She seems to be doing better though .. she's back to working out and doing yoga .. she's lost weight and gotten very fit for the first time in like 10+ years, she has a boyfriend who she seems to really love but who knows how he really feel about her. She has more custody of her children. She gets to go out a bit more, and she has been taking a break from working for the past 3 years or so.

&#x200B;

So, I dunno. I don't think her dad is as bad as people make him out to be, I think he does care and had her best interests at heart. I think she is still more bad off than people realize, the judge wouldn't keep granting conservatship if she wasn't. But that doesn't mean there isn't some crazy family drama going on behind closed doors because clearly there is. But that's all I think it is .. family drama."
389,2020-01-23 20:01:23,eswxy2,"I think that her dad has narcissistic personality disorder and subjected Britney to an entire lifetime of emotional and psychological abuse.   I think that she allowed the conservatorship to happen as a ruse for feeling he had her best interests at heart, wanting to please him and feeling like finally, she could take something off her plate (being continually overwhelmed with high expectations to be perfect).  And she is/was trying to get away from him but now is screwed because it's more or less a permanent arrangement"
390,2020-01-23 23:34:41,eswxy2,"So, in other words...she's a slave."
391,2020-01-24 00:31:09,eswxy2,This is so fucked up. I hope that we begin questioning fame and its system.
392,2020-01-24 02:23:42,eswxy2,"I can't even believe how much of this I didn't know, and I consider myself pretty up to date on things like this. Thank you for putting this together. Wow."
393,2020-01-24 04:04:34,eswxy2,"I remember last year there was some rumblings in the media (not a lot, but some: I think The Talk was one of the few shows to do a feature on this whole saga). 

I did not like the direction the whole ""Free Britney"" movement took, as I also felt like there were people who were extreme fans of hers harassing her family and making the situation more awkward for Britney by threatening people close to her. To me, these people did not necessarily seem interested in seeing Britney actually be free to make her own choices but free to perhaps collaborate on another album. At this point, all you can hope for is that Britney does whatever the hell she wants, whether it's make music or just move on with her life."
394,2020-01-24 06:16:49,eswxy2,This is fucking dark
395,2020-01-24 06:39:30,eswxy2,It is impossible to know what is really going on in this situation.  Families are complicated (and dysfunctional) enough without the extra pressures of fame.  It seems there are some serious mental health issues here too - how can we know whether a person is telling the whole truth or if they are expressing a symptom of madness?
396,2020-01-24 10:28:20,eswxy2,"Ok. I love Britney. But considering her acting very childlike.. I would be afraid if she was actually freed. I think that she has some serious mental health issue and addiction issue on top of that. A singer from my country killed herself like six years ago. Before media made fun of her.. But the thing is, she acted exactly like Britney in her last years. And I'm afraid Britney would hurt herself if she didn't have people around her.

She seems to be doing well but it could very well be just because she is medicated and I believe that it's because of her being in conservatorship. I believe that people want to profit off her but.. I don't think they are all monsters. I think that they don't want her to end up like Amy Winehouse or other singers. I believe the judges. No one can be in conservatorship for no reason for so long. I think this is the only way to keep her on track. Maybe one day she will publish a book about it."
397,2020-01-24 11:05:13,eswxy2,"I didnt even know this was going on. Sounds to me she was groomed by her parents and managers and now she broke they try to hide her to protect ""the product and brand"".

Sad."
398,2020-01-24 13:08:43,eswxy2,I always felt badly for Britney and her life situation.  So obvious she is the meal ticket for so many people. Time to let her go to lead the life she chooses.
399,2020-01-24 13:37:14,eswxy2,Maybe we shouldn‚Äôt have left Britney alone.
400,2020-01-24 13:44:51,eswxy2,Wasn‚Äôt a court going to decide if the conservatorship will continue on Jan 22nd? I Need to check...
401,2020-01-24 14:04:25,eswxy2,Leave Britney alone
402,2020-01-24 14:57:50,eswxy2,So r/southpark almost got it right???
403,2020-01-24 15:43:05,eswxy2,The treatment of celebrities today is exploitative at best and abusive at worst. It's disgusting
404,2020-01-23 22:34:59,eswxy2,Wow. That's horrible to hear. If true then she needs to be rescued.
405,2020-01-24 01:58:15,eswxy2,"Damn, there are so many people on this thread who are so ignorant about mental illness. 

Most of the lecturers have probably never dealt with a loved one suffering such a serious mental illness. 

I can't imagine that many of you would be so cavalier if your baby was dropped or if your family member was inviting her stalkers (which is what paparazzi were to her) into her home at random.

Britney spent or gave away to random scumbags and users a LOT of money. She likely has 24/7 top-notch care. That is expensive. 

Maybe her father assessed her finances, consulted with her doctors and social workers, and thought the Vegas residency could be both financially and mentally healthy?"
406,2020-01-23 20:16:29,eswxy2,"Conservatorship is very clearly defined under California law, a person has to be shown to be a threat to themselves or others, or to be so ""gravely disabled"" that they can't care for themselves. 

Most people under conservatorship are addled elders or hopeless schizophrenics. The only way a person as young and functional as Britney could qualify is if she had a serious mental illness.

Of course there could be a judge corrupt enough to okay the conservatorship on a healthy woman, but there's probably more than one judge involved. 

And if she was fine, she or someone close to her would be moving hell and high water to get her rights back, and it's not like she has no resources. So really, the only good explanation for the conservatorship is a severe mental illness."
407,2020-01-24 02:18:59,eswxy2,[deleted]
408,2020-01-23 20:40:08,eswxy2,"Britney Spears is chronically mentally ill. She is in a conservatorship to manage her illness, keep her safe, and protect her money so that she and her children are provided for for the rest of their lives.

Look under your nearest underpass if you want to see what untreated chronic mental illness looks like. It is not pretty and sufferers are often noncompliant. It isn't like a cold that you can just medicate for a time and are then ""cured."" Her condition is permanent and she requires lifelong care.

Every single legal and medical professional who's actually privy to the details of her case agrees she needs this."
409,2020-01-24 00:46:09,eswxy2,"So one of the bodyguards was in on it from the father and he hung around until she did something wild like shave her head and took advantage of that moment,on behalf of the father, to make her appear crazy so the father could take control of her aka her money? Is that the alleged claim of how this started?"
410,2020-01-24 00:49:58,eswxy2,"What if ""I'm a slave 4 u"" was about this?"
411,2020-01-24 03:33:17,eswxy2,"To me it‚Äôs not much of a mystery.  It‚Äôs just famous people and the people around them who want the money and influence.  Michael Jackson, the Beatles. Elvis, a lot of rappers all end up with folks who are family or close friends who basically hang on to the coattails and use their close positions to gain money and control.  

It‚Äôs really sad.  Brittany was a kid when she was sexualized and thrown to the masses.  No wonder she had a breakdown.  The people around her probably made that worse."
412,2020-01-24 03:49:33,eswxy2,This would make a great podcast episode on r/endlessthread
413,2020-01-24 05:58:52,eswxy2,Man. This is eye opening! I had no idea any of this was going on. I remember the heads shaving. I thought it was just drugs and rehab and better. But this is crazy.
414,2020-01-24 08:07:08,eswxy2,"This sounds remarkably similar to Brian Wilson and his psychiatrist, Eugene Landey. So awful."
415,2020-01-24 08:40:59,eswxy2,I don‚Äôt know anything about this but I recently saw some of her posts on TikTok and they are bizarre enough to make you scratch your head but also normal enough to write them off as ‚ÄúBritney being Britney‚Äù.
416,2020-01-24 08:46:21,eswxy2,"Should her true fans stop supporting the industry that keeps her a slave? I.e stop going to her ‚Äúshows‚Äù, stop buying her music etc"
417,2020-01-24 10:09:05,eswxy2,"If she was adjudicated with a mental defect, she'd most likely have to have someone manage her affairs, especially financially, we don't know the whole story, she might very well be very sick."
418,2020-01-24 11:12:49,eswxy2,The #freebritney movement has been going on long before some comedians in 2019 mentioned it.
419,2020-01-24 12:57:49,eswxy2,THANK YOU THANK YOU for posting this! It is a sad and serious situation but sadly no one wants to talk about it. It needs to be spread. The more we spread it the better chance she gets of getting out
420,2020-01-24 16:17:24,eswxy2,"Reminds me the ""Rachel, Jack, and Ashley too"" from the latest ""Black mirror"" season"
421,2020-01-23 19:36:19,eswxy2,"Not that what happened to her isn't horrifying, but personally I'd like to know how much of her albums is actually her and how much is someone else (one hit wonder Myah Marie gets name-dropped a lot)."
422,2020-01-23 23:47:51,eswxy2,[deleted]
423,2020-01-24 05:04:18,eswxy2,"Britney is most assuredly severely mentally ill. My Mom and Brit had the same nail stylist for a while, and let me just say that this poor woman ended up turning Britney down after several sessions b/c she couldn‚Äôt handle 8 hour bookings. And the $ was killer too. Stated Brit was in her own head and incapable of the smallest tasks or deep thought. 

Also, my partner is a disabled vet with mentall illness. What has been leaked to the press, points, imo toward schizo-affective disorder. Something beyond bi-polar. Stress, lack of sleep, and/or drugs always excacerbate psychotic episodes. Being a superstar only fuels this unhealthy regimen."
424,2020-01-24 01:23:28,eswxy2,"I always thought her dad took a ridiculously small salary for the size of assets he is managing? Perhaps I am recalling incorrectly? 

all her money has got to be going in trusts  for her and her kids. A judge is reviewing it. 

If a law firm or money manager took control, she‚Äôd likely be squeezed dry by their fees. 

It‚Äôs sad but she likely had to keep working - child support and she likely got herself into a lot of business financial trouble too (pre-conservation). 

Her Vegas residency allowed her to have a scheduled life. Her father hasn‚Äôt made any bad choices for her. 

Part of her recent decline was due to him being so sick. 

The dom violence thing about her dad andher kids fell apart, I thought?

No one from the family has actually claimed he‚Äôs not fit to be her conservator. 

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a mystery at all:

She has the mental age of like a 11-12-13 year old. So I can see her being able to perform but not drive or handle finances. I think it‚Äôs fairly obvious she is mentally ill and has a drug addled brain. Who else should take care of her? A law firm that takes a huge percentage and doesn‚Äôt care about her at all or her father who takes a reasonable salary?"
425,2020-01-24 02:41:50,eswxy2,"Wow all of this is so interesting. But I recently came across her Instagram a month or so ago and something seems very off about her.

She seems like she‚Äôs stuck in a teenagers mindset, the way she is constantly showing off her body and obsessing at how tiny she is. Her make up always looks like she just binged drink the night before and didn‚Äôt bother to take her make up off.

I hope she‚Äôs okay :/"
426,2020-01-24 13:02:31,eswxy2,How about her sister too? There‚Äôs a lot of shit surrounding the whole family. Rumors that Dan Schneider got her pregnant. All sorts of stuff.
427,2020-01-23 20:23:44,eswxy2,"I think she has schizoaffective disorder. If so, she's very lucky to have money and a family who will look after her. Most severely mentally ill people in the US are turned out on the streets and told to take their medication, and if your brain doesn't work then you won't be capable of doing that regularly enough."
428,2020-01-24 00:21:26,eswxy2,Her Instagram is heartbreaking. It's so obvious she is being controlled.
429,2020-01-24 04:27:40,eswxy2,"What I don't understand is why are the conservators assigned to these child stars ALLOWED to be their parents after all the history of abuse by family? It should be mandated, probably federally, that if a conservatorship is to be appointed, that the conservator be neither the parents nor those who have been accused, ever, of any sort of domestic abuse against the person. Like, a third party conservatorship. Impartial. Hell, a social worker would be better than a profiteer.  I just don't see, with the machine that is Hollywood and the entertainment industry, any person having control of these people doing what's in THEIR best interest when it's a relative who benefits directly from the status. It's all about greed and who controls the bank account, and someone who has NO interest in the situation should be paid conservator.  Otherwise, it's just a form of slavery. 

   And conservatorships aren't permanent, are they? They need renewed every so often, I thought. It's supposed to be a temporary thing, reviewed on a regular basis and ordered to continue. If her doctor died she needs to be court-ordered to get a new one to continue the conservatorship order. If every doctor dies when they're about to take her off of her conservatorship, then we have a problem."
430,2020-01-24 17:42:02,eswxy2,I wonder if there is security to make sure SHE doesn‚Äôt leave . That boyfriend- paid by father I‚Äôm sure. But isn‚Äôt he 25?
431,2020-01-23 18:19:02,eswxy2,LEAVE BRITNEY ALONE!!!!!111
432,2020-01-23 19:02:32,eswxy2,I have a coworker who is on Britney‚Äôs father‚Äôs side. It‚Äôs annoying.
433,2020-01-23 22:25:28,eswxy2,This is horribly sad.
434,2020-01-23 22:49:19,eswxy2,Leave Britney Spears alone!
435,2020-01-24 00:31:34,eswxy2,People gaining that much control often are narcissistic and abusive.
436,2020-01-24 03:11:43,eswxy2,"I'd never heard of the Free Britney movement before - suprised it was never a segment on Yes, Yes, No.   


Great write up and definitely something a bit different for this sub!"
437,2020-01-24 03:21:13,eswxy2,Listen to her song ‚ÄúOverprotected‚Äù
438,2020-01-24 03:35:03,eswxy2,Wait a minute?! Did South Park get it right?
439,2020-01-24 03:44:45,eswxy2,"Ever since the ""shaved head"" incident, there's plenty of people I know who doesn't trust anything she does. They think that she might go mad once again and do something obscene.

If there's a modern example of a singer who had it all, then lost it, then became part of a conspiracy...then it's her."
440,2020-01-24 06:10:42,eswxy2,hollywood/LA is its‚Äô own fucked up cult
441,2020-01-24 13:59:32,eswxy2,"Her family keeps her unstable band addicted in order to keep extracting money from her.

It's pretty common with the parents of child stars."
442,2020-01-23 22:33:46,eswxy2,Probably a case of DID (dissociative personality disorder) caused by trauma from her minor years.
443,2020-01-24 01:14:10,eswxy2,"I‚Äôm surprised lawyers aren‚Äôt lining up to help her. It‚Äôs fairly obvious it‚Äôs nothing but a legal hostage situation. I wonder if she said she was retiring if he would try to have her commuted.
If she was as unhealthy as he claims why in Gods name would he allow her to sign up for a grueling Vegas Residency. Unless he was benefiting."
444,2020-01-23 20:41:57,eswxy2,God this made me so incredibly sad. I hope she manages to get free from all this shit.
445,2020-01-24 17:35:22,eswxy2,Britney Spears is a mentally ill person who needs supervision. It‚Äôs as simple as that. There‚Äôs no conspiracy.
446,2020-01-23 18:59:08,eswxy2,"Wow, mind blown!!!"
447,2020-01-23 19:42:02,eswxy2,"So that's where the fuck she's been.

Great writeup OP, very interesting to say the least."
448,2020-01-23 18:28:06,eswxy2,"Wasn‚Äôt it confirmed she shaved her head to avoid drug testing?

Edit:  should be ‚Äúrumoured‚Äù not confirmed.  Who knows?"
449,2020-01-23 21:25:39,eswxy2,"Ugh...such a shame she has such sketchy ""support"" when she has to struggle with a legit illness (bipolar disorder) on top of everything else."

451,2020-01-24 01:56:14,eswxy2,"I need an expos√© on this ASAP. I knew when they cancelled the second Vegas residency something was really wrong. Because I watched the announcement it was [streamed live via Ellen](https://youtu.be/tC-YX01M4wM) . They made such a huge spectacle, just to cancel it. And when she finally comes on to announce the ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù it‚Äôs underwhelming and forced."
452,2020-01-24 03:11:48,eswxy2,"This sounds like Michael Jackson-level (or even worse) manipulation and control. I've loved Britney for years and this makes me very sad. Anyone heard the theory about her voice? Kendall Rae did a video about Britney conspiracies, but it looks like it has been taken down."
453,2020-01-24 03:44:32,eswxy2,"If she was on-stage performing, couldn‚Äôt she have told the audience what was going on?  She could blurt out, ‚ÄúI am being held against my will, please help me.‚Äù  Maybe it wouldn‚Äôt make a difference but it would be better than nothing."
454,2020-01-24 11:57:51,eswxy2,Has anyone mentioned that Black Mirror episode with Miley Cyrus? Seems to strongly hint some of that stuff is going on now and will only get worse in the future if we allow total control over another human beings life.
455,2020-01-24 13:57:43,eswxy2,This almost seems like the situation Brian Wilson was in with that quack doctor who was controlling him.
456,2020-01-24 14:33:14,eswxy2,"We've been infiltrated by the front page, y'all.

I'm all for it! Unsolved cases need more eyes on them."
457,2020-01-24 15:30:29,eswxy2,I thought it was all done to help the corn harvest

459,2020-01-23 23:15:15,eswxy2,So what happened in court yesterday?
460,2020-01-23 23:21:01,eswxy2,"i had NO idea!

what was the outcome of the court hearing?"
461,2020-01-23 23:21:52,eswxy2,She's been brainashed like all those other pedowood actors/singers that have a mental breakdown.
462,2020-01-24 02:05:05,eswxy2,"Crazy stuff. Im always amazed at what people choose to become for a little bit of money, or a lot even."
463,2020-01-24 02:29:49,eswxy2,The entire true crime community.
464,2020-01-24 02:37:08,eswxy2,This makes me think about Michael Jackson.
465,2020-01-24 02:44:25,eswxy2,I want to know what other info you have! I love Britney and this is just so heartbreaking
466,2020-01-24 02:55:35,eswxy2,"Unfortunately, she‚Äôs just a cash cow for some abusive and indigent parasites. I hope at some point she finds liberty."
467,2020-01-24 03:03:52,eswxy2,"Black Mirror vibes anyone? I feel like In the near future when technology is good enough, record companies wont even need the artists once they die. Theyll just keep producing their songs with the vocals they have gathered."
468,2020-01-24 03:54:23,eswxy2,This breaks my heart. Literally hurts reading this. Why not try to get away from the camera eye? Go to a smaller area and spaced out more. Take in outdoors. Run free and write some amazing music.
469,2020-01-24 03:57:42,eswxy2,"I didn't know that her father still had control over her. Also am not versed in conservatorship. But, wouldn't she be able to get proof from medical professionals that she's mentally fit to care for herself and contest the conservatorship in court? I don't understand how a seemingly healthy (physical and mental) adult needs to continue to be at the mercy of someone else."
470,2020-01-24 04:17:06,eswxy2,Straight from that Black Mirror episode with Miley cyrus ?
471,2020-01-24 05:13:19,eswxy2,"Oh man :( 

Based off absolutely nothing concrete, I wouldn't be surprised if something happens to her and she passes before her time."
472,2020-01-24 08:05:17,eswxy2,"That‚Äôs so crazy, why can‚Äôt somebody do something?!"
473,2020-01-24 08:11:27,eswxy2,LEAVE BRITNEY ALONE!
474,2020-01-24 08:16:40,eswxy2,"She has been a marketable product since childhood, this neither shocks or surprises me"
475,2020-01-24 09:28:33,eswxy2,Did Britney originally get hooked on drugs after her knee surgery?
476,2020-01-24 09:40:09,eswxy2,"I had almost forgotten about the ""Leave Britney Alone"" video:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqSTXuJeTks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqSTXuJeTks)"
477,2020-01-24 10:46:18,eswxy2,"Wow, thanks for the post, I had no idea this was happening."
478,2020-01-24 11:13:32,eswxy2,"This is wild. Thank you for your explanation, links, and bringing this to our attention."
479,2020-01-24 12:03:14,eswxy2,Wow I didn‚Äôt know any of this. That‚Äôs crazy
480,2020-01-24 13:51:30,eswxy2,The episode of black mirror with Miley Cyrus is what got me into the whole Brittany situation
481,2020-01-24 13:53:44,eswxy2,"Geez, just had a flashback to the Black Mirror episode where the pop singer is kept alive in a coma so they can harvest songs from her head."
482,2020-01-24 14:06:27,eswxy2,Let's all hope the latest South Park episodes don't further affect her mental health.
483,2020-01-24 14:28:24,eswxy2,Remindme! 1 week
484,2020-01-24 16:23:25,eswxy2,"I always feel a bit badly for child stars, because this kind of things almost always happens. They get surrounded by people who claim to be taking care of them, but who are just exploiting them. Then, they think that this is what love and caring look like, and it just twists them for life.

Look at what's happening to Lia Marie Johnson right now, and she's not nearly as big as Britney Spears was. It's tragic."
485,2020-01-23 23:11:22,eswxy2,Similar to the Miley Cyrus black mirror episode
486,2020-01-24 03:49:01,eswxy2,I also iirc heard a theory that suggests Dan Schneider of nickelodeon was the the father of Jamie's baby which drive Britney to the shaved head psychosis incident.
487,2020-01-24 04:22:36,eswxy2,Post is excellent! Would love to see more of these types of mysteries as well. Richard Simmons would also be a good topic.
488,2020-01-24 08:40:33,eswxy2,It sounds like the Black Mirror episode with Miley Cyrus is an extension on Britney‚Äôs life. And is probably true in part to a lot of performers from a young age.
489,2020-01-24 09:44:20,eswxy2,I think Britney has been seen a social experiment and a business model from the moment she became famous. ‚ÄòHow far can we go to break someone completely?‚Äô
490,2020-01-24 15:25:32,eswxy2,"well dang digity, that was quite a read"
491,2020-01-23 19:15:11,eswxy2,"Very sad. The one thing I‚Äôm convinced if however, is that the head shaving was deliberate to prevent a hair drug test during her custody battle.  This was a mom determined to keep her kids."
492,2020-01-23 19:42:05,eswxy2,Google Myah Marie. Britney is less involved in her life than anyone can even imagine.
493,2020-01-23 19:03:00,eswxy2,"Holy crap this is unsettling. 

Just my 2 cents, the shaving her head incident was, from what I heard, a way to avoid drug tests. Even if she cleaned up they could still sample her hair to see drug use going back months/years, which could have been used against her in custody fights. 

But HFS this is a creepy story..."
494,2020-01-24 14:32:12,eswxy2,"Sorry but unless anyone knows her, everyone's detective work is spent on the articles and headlines that the paparazzi write about her.  You think if she found this thread she'd think ""oh lovely my fans are supporting me"" or ""ah more gossip stemming from tabloids and magazines"""
495,2020-01-23 19:37:11,eswxy2,I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a conspiracy at all. I think she‚Äôs mentally unwell and if not for family stepping in she would broke and possibly dead by now. Back in the early 2000s and during the height of the paparazzi she was erratic and running with a bad crew.
496,2020-01-23 21:31:00,eswxy2,Damn. Thanks for this information
497,2020-01-23 21:57:19,eswxy2,I feel sorry for anyone raised as a celebrity. Hollywood does sh*t to ya man! üò¢
498,2020-01-24 00:24:02,eswxy2,This is very similar to the [James Brown conspiracy CNN covered](https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2019/02/us/james-brown-death-questions/) and is just so sad and devastating.
499,2020-01-24 00:32:05,eswxy2,"For someone who had no idea what's been going on with her, but someone who's up to date on Black Mirror, I've already seen this episode."
500,2020-01-24 00:37:36,eswxy2,This is just the new black mirror episode but instead of ashley its britney
501,2020-01-24 02:00:00,eswxy2,"Jesus Christ, I had no idea it went this deep. I absolutely, 100% support #FreeBritney!"
502,2020-01-24 06:10:49,eswxy2,"This whole story would make an amazing movie. Poor Britney, I‚Äôve always loved her and it‚Äôs not fair."
503,2020-01-24 11:22:34,eswxy2,"That last episode of Black Mirror was wicked stupid. But ironically probably one of the most ""real"" of all of them."
504,2020-01-24 13:41:16,eswxy2,I always heard that the meltdown was a stunt for her to shave her head to destroy any evidence of prior drug use.
505,2020-01-24 15:02:49,eswxy2,Hey didnt South Park touch on this
506,2020-01-24 14:39:32,eswxy2,"Not sure if someone already mentioned this but the whole time i was reading this i was thinking of the new season of black mirror and Miley Cyrus one. Then when you said she had the same manager it was like wtf. Did Miley Cyrus do that episode to tell us all something, its kinda a weird coincidence."
507,2020-01-23 22:15:12,eswxy2,Jesus Christ this is nuts
508,2020-01-24 11:39:05,eswxy2,Don't forget Nickelodeon producer Dan Schneider fathering a child with Jamie Lynne Spears when she was underage!
509,2020-01-23 19:32:02,eswxy2,[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQQFV6Pu5NI&frags=pl%2Cwn) always stuck with me. It's clear she has mental health issues.
510,2020-01-24 01:12:03,eswxy2,Someone must watch Joe Rogan.
511,2020-01-24 02:43:06,eswxy2,She supposedly cut her hair because they were going to test her for marijuana and during the court case for child custody that would have come up.
512,2020-01-24 03:04:36,eswxy2,It sounds kinda like what happened to Brian Wilson from The Beach Boys
513,2020-01-24 03:29:23,eswxy2,Hold my axe this is some scary stuff. Reminds me of the Black Mirror Episode with Miley Cyrus.
514,2020-01-24 10:50:07,eswxy2,This is the essence of all showbusiness.
515,2020-01-24 11:41:24,eswxy2,South Park got it so so right about her situation.
516,2020-01-23 18:29:18,eswxy2,"Is crippling mental illness really that much of a mystery? She was 5150ed when she barricaded herself with her very young children. Routines are important to mental health, and as a child Star, it‚Äôs literally all she knows."
517,2020-01-23 22:21:10,eswxy2,"Wow I had no idea of this... conservatorship is serious business and it seems strange to grant it just for a single instance erratic behavior especially given Britney‚Äôs stressful situation at the time... seems like an abuse of the system. I hope she can recover from the trauma of all this, her father sounds like a real POS."
518,2020-01-23 22:58:35,eswxy2,"Well something similar happened in Mexico a bunch or years ago if you Google the name of a mexican singer ""Gloria Trevi"" basically her mother sold her no her manager when she was underaged and a whole bunch of other minors were also involved there was even a murder thing going on ,so I hope Britney can escape that shit before it's too late"
519,2020-01-24 08:52:47,eswxy2,The media has stayed quiet because they only report what they‚Äôre told to.
520,2020-01-24 15:25:39,eswxy2,Someones been listening to Joe Rogan
521,2020-01-24 15:26:41,eswxy2,Oof I was sad my mom didn‚Äôt put me in Mickey Mouse club when I was little and now I feel lucky for not having to face this possibility...
522,2020-01-24 16:46:53,eswxy2,Exploitative nonsense.

524,2020-01-23 22:57:41,eswxy2,The mother of my best friend growing up went to school with Britney‚Äôs siblings and Britney for a short time. I love her.
525,2020-01-24 01:20:55,eswxy2,Britney Spears.
526,2020-01-24 06:19:10,eswxy2,"Her situation is sad, I'm a big fan and always wish this to end... but we all know why her conservatorship has not been ended: **Money**.

*""If you had a chicken laying golden eggs... will you kill it or sell it? or in this case, will you set her free?""*

Well... obviously no. A looot of people leech her... maybe in the future will know... Like a corruption scandal showing all of this... sad."
527,2020-01-24 15:00:09,eswxy2,"If she does not die by fourth moon, harvest will yield no bounty."
528,2020-01-24 00:39:49,eswxy2,"This is beginning to Pi$$ me off. I had a friend who died of cancer while hiding in his bedroom from his own adult son who was a violent schizophrenic who refused to take his meds. He wasn't held prisoner until after his father died when he threatened his grandparents and broke into their house. He went to jail, not a psych hospital, and was released after a short sentence. This was despite having threatened the judge at his trial and referring to himself as Jesus. THEY COULD NOT FORCE HIM INTO A MENTAL FACILITY! They couldn't even require him to take his medication. This post is adding to the problem. People are afraid to seek help enough as it is. Whatever issues Ms. Spears has regarding her parents and her estate she is not a prisoner in a nineteenth century sanitarium. 

Not to mention being on a group where people discuss murder victims, and missing children. When did this become TMZ?"
529,2020-01-23 18:58:34,eswxy2,I‚Äôm dubious about most claims regarding Monarch programming and beta kittens but I think Britney‚Äôs case is a strong evidence that nefarious mind control exists. The number of people profiting on her compliance is baffling
530,2020-01-23 20:51:03,eswxy2,"Jesus El Camino Christ :\\ 

Poor Britney Spears :\\"
531,2020-01-24 16:13:06,eswxy2,It‚Äôs modern day MK-Ultra monarch control. Look at the CIA‚Äôs website under project blue bird and or project star gate it‚Äôs all the same thing as MK ultra just renamed and it explains the brain washing and control of the individual against their will etc.
532,2020-01-23 23:15:40,eswxy2,"I'm calling BS.

It is almost impossible to be forced into a mental healthcare facility in the US for more than 72 hours. The Baker Act is the law regarding this in Florida where I live, and Spears' state of California is no different with the LPS law. Whatever her legal wranglings are over the control of her estate the captive mental health patient is nothing more than a myth.

People who have severe psychiatric health issues are almost impossible to keep hospitalized. Schizophrenia patients can't even be forced to take their anti psychotics despite posing a threat to themselves and others unless there are multiple witnesses. It has to be proven in a court before a judge.

You should not add to the already existing fears people have when it comes to seeking the help they need. People have enough trouble as it is getting the help they need when loved ones are suffering."
533,2020-01-23 23:23:00,eswxy2,"I think it would be a nightmare trying to care for Britney. 130,000 a year sure isn‚Äôt worth what Jamie has to go through. 
I don‚Äôt believe he did anything to Britney or her kids, other than try and get them to act right."
534,2020-01-23 20:04:00,eswxy2,"I‚Äôm not entirely sure that this a subject appropriate for this sub. What is the actual mystery that you think you‚Äôre presenting here? This is mostly about a woman‚Äôs mental health. This whole movement has come out of two comedians who started a podcast based solely on a pop star‚Äôs Instagram, which is unhealthy fandom journalism already, and it devolved to the point that Britney had to come out and beg for her privacy. This isn‚Äôt helping her. It‚Äôs just two obsessed fans who wanted to become famous and decided to ride on Britney‚Äôs coattails."
535,2020-01-23 23:58:05,eswxy2,I‚Äôve always thought this was terrible.  She should‚Äôve been free to drink and drug her self to death and blow all of her money.  Can‚Äôt believe she‚Äôs been a prisoner this long.
536,2020-01-24 04:03:47,eswxy2,"I was just watching that interview where she definitely was a bit weird, where she says ""oh hello"" real randomly like a split personality"
537,2020-01-24 11:34:52,eswxy2,Britney is a phenomenal talent who seems happy in life and understandably exhausted from her tour and fame. I think if she wanted to leave the conservatorship she would. She has the smarts and genius to figure it out. She has the biggest megaphone in the world for one thing.
538,2020-01-23 22:51:31,eswxy2,Why does anyone outside her family care wtf is her life?
539,2020-01-24 00:49:34,eswxy2,The scenario you‚Äôre used for digging

supposedly the programming broke and thats when she shaved her head and smacked that car window. Lotta weird shit going on in hollywood."
541,2020-01-24 16:30:58,eswxy2,Britney is a victim of trauma-based mind control -- what the CIA studied during MKULTRA. Read [the Greenbaum Speech](https://archive.org/details/HypnosisInMPDRitualAbuse.TheGreenbaumSpeech) to know more.
542,2020-01-23 20:40:09,eswxy2,Where is the source for all this info about Britney's mental health issues?
543,2020-01-24 02:10:39,eswxy2,"Man, that's quite... toxic"
544,2020-01-24 14:37:19,eswxy2,And people think MKUltra stopped...
545,2020-01-24 14:47:39,eswxy2,So.....what‚Äôs the unsolved mystery?

I just dont care what fabricated ass rich celebrity problems this girl is suffering through. Like boo hoo.

The first definition of ""mystery"" I could find on Google is ""something that is difficult or impossible to understand or explain"". Mentally unstable people with lots of money being exploited by their relatives because of the money isn't difficult to understand, or even that unusual.

You could say there's a controversy, because there's two sides to whether this is or isn't happening, but it isn't mysterious either way. I can see why people like posts like this, but they're really better suited to celebrity gossip or news sub-reddits."

She was always nice and down to Earth. 


She did always have a man with her who I assumed was her body guard. 


Unfortunately, while I was working there, our local newspaper ran a front page article about how she shopped there often and people began coming just to get a glimpse of her and she stopped coming all together."
579,2020-01-23 22:00:40,eswxy2,I was on medical leave from work in 2007 so I saw Brittany's life falling apart on TV nearly every night for awhile.  I felt so bad for her.

It‚Äôs all super weird when you read more into this poor woman‚Äôs life. Britney originally went on a double date that was set up for her with Jason and she had no interest in him, and Britney‚Äôs mother then got involved and encouraged him to hit the gym, get a nicer haircut etc so that Britney would date him. I don‚Äôt know if Britney was aware that he was being paid, but certainly the whole thing was carefully managed by her family who thought that he would make a good partner for Britney after her previous two disastrous marriages that had been more about rebelling against her mother, particularly the Vegas wedding"

614,2020-01-24 12:20:56,eswxy2,"That ends badly, too.  We had a minor scandal here in my state involving abusive conservatorships by non-family court appointed conservators who bilked their clients assets, actively worked to deny their release from conservatorship even after the people involved were cured or no longer in the circumstances that created them.

It's like you almost need two conservators who are in an adversarial relationship, an auditor-type conservator who gets a bonus when they discover abusive conservatorship behavior but otherwise has no other responsibilities and gets paid from some source of funding distinct from the conservatorship.  And then the acting conservator who has control over finances, assets, the conservatee's life choices, etc.

The only other thing that would be a fail safe would be a fixed limit on any single conservator's control over a specific person before the court reviewed the situation and assigned some other unconnected individual to be conservator.  This has loads of problems, though, related to continuity of care and the use of family members as conservators.

The big problem is that any unitary conservator has a major incentive to maintain their conservatorship, especially if the person in question has real assets, and can pretty easily manipulate the courts to accept their narrative as right and true to keep it going.  The courts seem to lack the resources and motivation to know when they have become abusive or self-serving."

It's not clear to me if she still needs a conservatorship, although I suspect it saved her life back when it was put in place. It is clear to me that regardless, the facts are more complex and the legalities more complex than people on Twitter can possibly know. It's also clear to me that given the issues between her dad and her son, and the public perception, if nothing else, of impropriety, it's time to look into a conservator with no prior association with anyone who has ever been in the Spears family's orbit."

625,2020-01-24 02:04:55,eswxy2,"I think your assessment that she is actually severely mentally ill is likely correct, sadly. And your points about her parents and childhood are likely correct, as well.

Britney has been ""off"" for years. I was a huge fans of hers as a kid (I was born in 93 and by the time I was like 10-12 I was confused by her and what she was turning into - she got sooo sexualized and I was too young for that shit - but loved her in her earliest days). I will always have a soft spot for Britney as she was the first singer/performer I ever really knew and really enjoyed. So sometimes I fall down the ""what happened to Britney rabbit hole"" and rather recently watched some documentaries she was in or videos/compliations of interviews she did through the years, from late 90s/early 2000s to breakdown days and since. She is a different person, and has been for years now. Her affect is off, she is dead in the eyes. She's like a shell, a robot. It's hard to see. Idk if it's her medication or her illness(es) or a combo of both, but she is not right. And her instagram also suggests something is off with her. She is very childlike, to the point it makes me uncomfortable in her instagram videos.

I really do think your assessment is correct but part of me thinks the conspiracy theories about her and her whole situation aren't crazy. Because if she really is that ill, I don't see how her performing helps anyone but those profiting off her. She lives a sad life and she's always been such a sweet girl who wanted happiness and loved life and was full of life, this is obvious when watching old videos and documentaries of her from her early days in her pop career. I hope she gets it some day.

I'd also like to know what you know about Jamie Lynn and her brother as well."
626,2020-01-24 03:40:48,eswxy2,">She is a different person, and has been for years now. Her affect is off, she is dead in the eyes. She's like a shell, a robot. It's hard to see.

THIS.

I grew up with Britney, too, but I haven't kept much track of her since. I just went to her Instagram for the first time, and I was legitimately creeped out by everything you mentioned (flat affect, dead eyes, robotic, childlike). This poor girl never had a chance."
627,2020-01-24 07:32:27,eswxy2,"Before her breakdown in the barber shop, Britney was on a slow and steady decline. It started sometime shortly after In The Zone released. Britney hurt her knee around that time, one of her singles got canceled because she couldn‚Äôt film the music video, and her dancing never recovered. Her moves were mainly arms and upper body, super robotic, and the fans started to notice her decline in showmanship around then. 

Then she met Kevin and started becoming more ‚Äúdown to earth‚Äù vs the pampered princess persona. Walking around in dirty clothes, barefoot in public, messy hair. Her reality show about her early days with Kevin just bombed. Her and Kevin just seemed stoned and messy 24/7. And the public REALLY REALLY started turning on her. 

She started appearing more and more unkempt in paparazzi pictures. Constantly dying and changing her hair, damaging it SOOO much that her extension tracks were visible constantly. She started hanging out with Paris, Nicole, and Lindsay when they were notorious for abusing drugs and being unstable and reckless. Britney and Lindsay were going around flashing the paparazzi constantly for some reason. 

Anyway, back to Britney‚Äôs extension tracks: they were a M E S S. A matted, greasy, stringy mess. I mean: she was using drugs, exhausted, had post partum, harassed, driving around with babies in her lap, getting Coffee Bean and Frapps every day. Her hair suffered the most for it. Anyone with clinical depression can take one look at her hair and recognize right away that Britney was DEEEEEP in an episode after a slow decline over the span of 2-3 years. 

I imagine she was too tired and couldn‚Äôt be bothered anymore by her hair and everyone‚Äôs opinions on it and it was too much for her right then. One less thing to worry about. 

The older I get, the more I understand that era of Britney lmao"
628,2020-01-24 13:38:04,eswxy2,"While I agree with all of this, I do get the impression that Britney does *genuinely* enjoy performing. I think that is the one joy she does have, sing, dancing and performing do make her happy. So, while it would be ideal for her to be able to step away, but like you said her family is so gross and are profiting off her, the fact that she can work, in my opinion, gives her a shred of purpose because it is something she loves."
629,2020-01-24 16:30:29,eswxy2,"About the dementia claims: I work as an elderly care specialist, where I meet dementia cases constantly. I can say it's highly, *highly* unlikely that someone suffering from it would be able to sing and dance onstage coherently, much less go on tour."
630,2020-01-24 02:12:47,eswxy2,I wouldn‚Äôt say Jamie Lynn is a hot mess??? She seems to have her life together. She‚Äôs married has 2 kids and seems to have a happy life. The only news from her was that she got pregnant at 16 and a few years ago her daughter crashed a golf cart into a lake (she‚Äôs fine) but accidents happen
631,2020-01-24 05:12:08,eswxy2,"I too genuinely think she's sick. What irks me is why is she well enough to perform then? When you start to question her conservatorship, it makes no sense how someone so ill is capable of work. By all means, Britney should be on disability (she obviously doesn't qualify because of her estate), but then she should also just not be working at all. It's such a shame. 

I also agree with you that the movement didn't really do much to change her situation. But the videos she posted on Instagram were proof she definitely has something. I'm not at liberty to assume what because I'm not very knowledgeable when it comes to medicine."
632,2020-01-24 01:41:22,eswxy2,"Interesting. Coming into this not knowing much about it, I always wondered if she was actually capable of making her own decisions or if she was controlled just so they could continue to profit from her. Seems like a mix of both, I can see how it benefits her but.. I just wonder if she has any REAL mental issues or they were brought on by all the things she goes thru, and drug use.  That‚Äôs what I can‚Äôt wrap my head around.
Does she actually have sickness or is it symptoms of the kind of life she lives? 

Do you think there is any real chance for her to recover from this?"

634,2020-01-24 17:39:25,eswxy2,"Is it not more likely that she is still heavily medicated from the time of her breakdown?

That was a long time ago now, going on 15 years.  People recover and I feel as though she hasn‚Äôt been given that opportunity.  But I‚Äôm just some rando who goes down the rabbit hole of her situation now and again when I feel like depressing myself."

641,2020-01-24 02:00:17,eswxy2,"Same thing happened to Amy Winehouse.  Just about every day she was in those free newspapers you get on the tube, often on the front cover.  She was laughed at for all her 'shenanigans' - she'd be stumbling around outside her flat, or out of venues, getting in fights, doing strange things.  People just laughed and reported on it in the sense of her being a druggie and a problematic person - not in the sense of needing help.

She was still getting booked for shows, even though she was in no state to do them.  She'd show up, absolutely hammered and put on a terrible and embarrasing short set and disappoint the punters and be reamed in the papers the next day.

I kept thinking to myself *WHY?  Why are people still booking her?  Who is letting this happen?*  She was called 'controversial' in the newspapers, 'out of control'.

And then she died... and suddenly she was the voice of the generation and a lost talent.   Where was that admiration for her talent, and the concern for self-destruction when she was stumbling around in Camden Town?  Where was their worry for her health when she was still able to be reached?"
642,2020-01-23 21:03:50,eswxy2,"There was quote from one of [The Cut](https://www.thecut.com/) writers I think that was like ""The older I get, the more I understand the Britney Spears head shaving incident"". I don't know how you would cope with the stress and oversight in her position."
643,2020-01-23 19:58:29,eswxy2,"What‚Äôs worse I feel like she was doomed from the start‚Äîa hypersexualized teenager in a school girl uniform. Like? Did she ever really stand a chance to control her own career and image? Did she ever have anyone looking out for her best interests?

I‚Äôm so sad that anyone had to go through this, let alone a cultural icon who can‚Äôt even go through it privately. However unwell she is, she is better off controlling her own life than giving power over to her current management and family."
644,2020-01-23 19:35:50,eswxy2,"My reaction at the time was not amusement. I thought it was a terrible, pitiable situation.

I remember when she went to rehab, someone at the facility was calling a radio station and divulging what she was sharing in group sessions.

Not just that it was happening so publicly but the fact some people were making light of it. For me, the most disturbing thing was when she was going to psychiatric unit and the paparazzi were taking photos and crowding around her being brought out to the ambulance. I was like what the fuck.

But the woman in the salon said when she went to help Britney shave her head she screamed, ""don't touch me! Everyone is always touching me!"", or something like that. She may have done it due to a little bit of both - drug test and a bit of a psychotic break/manic episode."

I read that she was never formally diagnosed as bipolar either but I believe the source who contacted the Britney Gram girls said she is given bipolar medication anyway (I wonder if that‚Äôs what she was referring to in court?).

Last year her dad allegedly accused her of breaking the conservatorship rules by...driving.  Just to clarify here, Britney is in her late 30's.  She is not some irresponsible teenager!

The sad thing is that I'm not sure this situation is as rare as people think.  In recent years there have been conservatorship controversies involving celebrities like Richard Simmons and Stan Lee.  But I think Britney's situation is possibly the creepiest, considering (1) it's her dad calling the shots, (2) the abuse allegations against her dad involving her 13-year-old son, and (3) the sheer amount of money Britney has made over her career and the team of people feeding off of it."
668,2020-01-23 19:37:03,eswxy2,"The rumors I've always heard was that a lot of $$$ was passed to various people (possibly still is today) to get Britney under that conservatorship, hence how out of the ordinary it is. I have no doubt a lot of people benefit from her being under it...the question is how much Britney herself benefits, if at all."
669,2020-01-24 03:22:09,eswxy2,"My experience is in North Carolina so, obviously, there will be differences in the law. However, my sister is just a few years older than Britney was when she [Britney] really started to spiral down. While my sister is doing slightly better now, for a while it was a total shitshow and my uncle tried to sue for *just* a financial conservatorship after she blew through around $750k of an inheritance in less than 3 years, mostly on a truly absurd amount of drugs, her fianc√©/son's father died of a cocaine OD, she has a young child and was set to receive another large sum from another inheritance. He did this to protect her from herself and also to try and get her to finally realize how fucked she was and that she needed to get to rehab before she orphaned her child. She thankfully did check into a really amazing rehab program but in the meantime, my uncle was only granted a 45 day emergency guardianship over her finances with a 45 day extension before he essentially had no other options and had to drop it.  So 90 days total. And this was all with the stated intention of having a third party/attorney manage any sort of conservatorship he could have set up and my uncle wouldn't have benefitted financially in any way. 

It's Britney Spears so there are way larger sums of money being dealt with and I'm really not up on what all she was doing drug-wise and what kind of shitty financial decisions she was making. However, I am extremely curious as to what all went on to support a 13 year conservatorship, zero financial control and several family members managing her entire life and basically every move. That cannot be an easy situation to orchestrate."
670,2020-01-23 22:56:16,eswxy2,"Thank you! I'm just a lay person, not a professional like you but I've dealt with courts, mentally ill/violent/delusional people, police, etc extensively. It was extremely challenging to even get my family member sectioned after she threatened self harm and DID hurt me. She tried to strangle me to death and the police were involved. Long story short... my family worked for years to get her help in some form.

When I think about what we went through just to get someone sectioned it makes no sense for her to have a whole conservatorship. 

If I had to guess the judge wants to leave it be because it's already in place and judges don't like changing things unless theres really compelling reasons to change it. I hope Britney is prepared to present a case showing her conservatorship is somehow actually illegal or out of the bounds of what is reasonable for her particular situation."

The hairdresser said they closed the blinds when she came in but the guy she was with kept opening them so the paparazzi could get their shots. She wasn't capable of protecting herself, and in fact, was surrounding herself with the lowest creeps around.

The more I read about her the more convinced I become that she has schizophrenia and delusions. No one is mentioning when she would randomly talk in various accents. Not as a joke, not to be funny. She just randomly went into different voices. She called herself other names at times. Writing a letter in the 3rd person like she is watching it rather than living it...that isnt to say there is no truth in those pages. There can be truth to some of it AND she can need and require constant care. Do you think a person who is putting her children in a dangerous situation would openly say she did that intentionally? Or could more truth be in a mentally unwell person did something dangerous with her child and has convinced herself that it was a set up? The only hope I hold after reading that lies in the fact she is saying what she did was wrong and that she was set up. She does a lot of self aware acknowledgment in that letter, which I wouldn't think a person who was under mental duress would be able to process. It honestly makes me more confused in a way. Why is it written in the 3rd person??"

Yes it‚Äôs Paris, but this is someone who was around a lot of heavy parties in young Hollywood and it seems Brittany‚Äôs behavior was odd even for her."
702,2020-01-24 09:07:32,eswxy2,"I tend to agree with you.

I think the lack of information around the nature of her illness leaves a vacuum for gossip, conspiracies and other kinds of stories. But I really do believe she's a lot more unstable than anyone in the public probably realises, probably more than the family wants to say. No one has ever said publicly what she's diagnosed with (to my knowledge), but I suspect it's a serious diagnosis and possibly more than one issue at play.
People need to be aware too that a lot of the information being fed to the Free Britney movement is coming from her mother and Sam Lufti - two major villains in this story tbh.
The father is being painted as a bad person, but in reality he was the one who stepped in when the shit hit the fan and took control when no one else would.
Yes, it's sad she has little agency in her life seemingly, but she seems a lot more together now and a lot more healthy than she did 10 years ago. If he hadn't stepped in, I'd wager she would be dead.

The issue is that so many people still don't understand mental illness. Britney Spears is very likely quite unwell and has been for years. It's possible she'll never be quite right again and will need assistance for the rest of her life. It's very sad but I dread to think where she'd be if she didn't have the supports and structured life she has at the moment, what would happen if her mother and Sam Lufti and the ""fans"" got their way.

From what I can see now, she spends a lot of time at home, painting, seeing her kids sometimes and exercising. Sure she probably has a lot of minders but that's a hell of a lot better than what was going on 10-12 years ago. 

Unfortunately she probably is just a lot more unwell than any of her regular fans realise and no one here is privy to her medical records, what's going on with her psychiatric condition, how she's coping day to day, what's going on in her therapy sessions etc etc."

Plus, her dad suffers from addiction issues and it is no secret Britney does as well or at least struggled with substance abuse as a result of mental health issues or vice versa. I think mental health issues run in the family and that coupled with her extreme lack of an education, you have a recipe for disaster.

I read Between You and Me by Emma McLaughlin and Nicola Kraus (of nanny diaries fame) and the ending makes me feel like it is very much like what happened between Kevin Federline and Britney regarding custody. Which then resulted in her cutting her mom out of her life for that period of time. Quick and entertaining (although very sad) read."

725,2020-01-24 03:22:03,eswxy2,Im surprised more of this angle isn‚Äôt brought up
726,2020-01-24 17:33:23,eswxy2,Can you explain?  What does she know?
727,2020-01-23 21:37:50,eswxy2,The black mirror episode with Miley Cyrus....
728,2020-01-23 20:43:13,eswxy2,"The Britney Spears case is Exhibit A for ""people don't understand severe mental illness."" This is what long-term care looks like for people in her situation. There are probably a lot of people living in tents on the streets of LA with psychiatric conditions similar to hers.

Due to the amount of money involved her case is far more complex, but she's honestly what conservatorship was made for."
729,2020-01-23 19:37:32,eswxy2,"Agree with all of this. She had a mental break and probably can‚Äôt function much outside performing, which she‚Äôs been doing all her life. At least not reliably.

If anyone follows her on Instagram, you can tell something isn‚Äôt right, and I doubt it‚Äôs due to being kept ‚Äòprisoner.‚Äô I do feel awful for her, but I don‚Äôt lean into the conspiracy side here."

736,2020-01-23 19:42:20,eswxy2,"Eh, the videos are weird in a ""cringe"" sort of way, but definitely not in a ""she needs to legally lose  access to her own money and career choices"" way.

They remind me of when I was younger and my friends and I would make up dances for videos at sleepovers. I think she's genuinely bored in the way a child without access to their own money or cars would be. When she can't get her dad to approve some vacation she wants to go on, her and her boyfriend play dress up and she posts a video dancing.

If anything, to me the videos show that her guardianship needs to be extremely loosened, if not lifted completely. She works hard and does a ton of shows in Vegas. Why does her hair and makeup look so bad? Why is always in her house with only her clothes and phone to play with? Her money isn't going to her, that's for sure. Even on an e*xtremely* responsible budget, she could afford better. 

She also *loves* singing and dancing, has always been a bit silly, and is a mom on social media. I think the videos are pretty par for the course for her personality/age, she's not a 20 year old who's super tuned into what's cool and not cool to post on Instagram. If cringe-y social media posts mean you need a legal guardian, you could take my own mom's bank account access away any day now.

She has (had?) issues, but if she were just a regular joe she'd *definitely* still have access to her own money and schedule. The conservatorship is overkill and abuse at this point."
737,2020-01-23 19:25:48,eswxy2,"She acts very similar to how I behaved when I was a teenager on heavy anti-psychotics (misdiagnosed).  I was so out of it and functioned ""normally"" day to day but mentally was like a child and just not myself.  I wouldn't be surprised if Britney is on heavy anti-psychotics.  I also don't think she is mentally ill-at least, not in the insane way she is painted to be (at most, depressed and incredibly stressed by how she is treated)."
738,2020-01-24 00:08:56,eswxy2,"I just checked her insta. I love britney so much, but after watching those video clips, yeah, I feel you are correct here. Hopefully it's just from meds, but it's not good."

740,2020-01-23 20:02:18,eswxy2,I follow her on IG too. What‚Äôs really creepy is the allegations that she doesn‚Äôt even have access to internet on her phone and all her posts are uploaded by the people around her and none of them are actually in real time. It‚Äôs almost like whoever‚Äôs managing her social media (or at least assisting in it) purposely makes the videos that way. Perhaps another method to perpetuate her instability in order to maintain her conservatorship. Just my guess.
741,2020-01-23 21:57:35,eswxy2,"That was exactly my impression after looking at her IG. Drugs or mental illness, I can't tell which. I'm sure growing up in a very unusual situation/environment added to a lack of proper socialization, as well."
742,2020-01-23 19:12:23,eswxy2,Agreed. Even on that one show she judges she seems so nervous & looks like she‚Äôs about to have a mental breakdown at any second.
743,2020-01-23 23:07:29,eswxy2,She never acted like that back in 2007/2008 when she was supposedly at her worst. I think the meds shes on might make her like that. :( she stopped taking them over Easter last year and they put her in a mental hospital against her will.
744,2020-01-23 19:44:59,eswxy2,"So because of this comment I looked at her Instagram and honestly, I really agree with you. She doesn't seem well."

747,2020-01-23 19:05:01,eswxy2,But how did it get to that like I understand drugs take a toll on you but she had together before her breakdown.
748,2020-01-23 19:56:26,eswxy2,I think she‚Äôs not well but they can also be capitalizing. If they are really controlling her she may be scared to do or say anything.

751,2020-01-23 21:54:15,eswxy2,"Am also a lawyer who has only dabbled in conservatorship issues once or twice, but the analysis in this article makes a lot of sense to me. If somebody with mental health issues under conservatorship appears to be doing well, to me that means the conservatorship is working as intended, it doesn't mean the person is all cured and ready to be independent. 



I've worked on a few high profile cases, and really the biggest bit of information I can offer to everyone in this thread: the stuff you hear about publicly is a FRACTION of what's really going on. Especially in cases like this where the court file is sealed/partly sealed."

758,2020-01-24 06:58:06,eswxy2,I just mentioned the South Park ep up thread too! Definitely when the show was still in its prime. It was funny how all these horrible celeb talk shows seemed so mean spirited about Britney (I remember all those tacky VH1 All Access specials from the early 2000s).
759,2020-01-24 17:23:26,eswxy2,Thank you!
760,2020-01-23 20:30:14,eswxy2,"> Who ever would have thought that the most responsible person in this mess would have been Kevin Federline?  
  
He‚Äôs not. Unless you consider piling on the money bandwagon and going after his ex-wife to support some of the other kids he‚Äôs fathered out of wedlock, to be more ‚Äúresponsible‚Äù.  
  
I could see even in that fake reality show they did that he was using her and she was in love with him.  
  
He convinced more than one of the women he impregnated that he was in love with them, but his true nature won out. User, manipulator, liar.

768,2020-01-24 02:58:18,eswxy2,Can you elaborate on this?
769,2020-01-24 14:26:28,eswxy2,It was never about Britney‚Äôs conservatorship until the emergency episode I linked so you‚Äôll be fine to go from there!

772,2020-01-23 20:26:22,eswxy2,Nope. Anyone familiar with abuse can see it in Jamie Spears.
773,2020-01-23 21:31:01,eswxy2,Either she's healthy enough to shove out onto a stage to do a live 3 hour show in front of an audience without risk of her having an episode OR she's super ill enough to need a conservatorship. You cannot have it both ways.
774,2020-01-24 10:08:02,eswxy2,What documentary?
775,2020-01-23 22:16:54,eswxy2,"Nope. If that was the real reason, her mother wouldn't be ""speaking out"", she would be ok with whatever her daughter was doing. By saying anything opposite to Jamie, her mom could lose access to Britney and maybe even money."
776,2020-01-24 00:48:09,eswxy2,Conservatorship abuse is very real and surprisingly more common than your comment suggests.
777,2020-01-23 22:51:04,eswxy2,"she spent her 20s tanning outdoors in california and smokes, i think that‚Äôs part of it too."
778,2020-01-24 07:16:19,eswxy2,"I'm just going to say this... Britney Spears wouldn't be mentally unstable (if she is) if it weren't for her mom and dad forcing fame, stress, work, pressure etc. On a child. She just posted on ig she has been working non stop since 8 years old. She was fucked from the get go. Her dad *may* be trying to help now, (probably not) but he's only cleaning up the mess he made. Children are to be protected not manipulated, abused and used for profit. Britney Spears never had a chance at a normal life, therefore a normal mentality. This falls solely on her parents, her caretakers."

782,2020-01-24 03:59:30,eswxy2,"She was in her late twenties, what young kid isn‚Äôt reckless and horny? I‚Äôm sure all of us got into all kinds of trouble. Also, just because she‚Äôs promiscuous doesn‚Äôt  mean anything, by that case let shackle all of Hollywood then."

786,2020-01-24 03:55:43,eswxy2,The judge was hence why a new one was appointed which is why I don‚Äôt believe she has a serious mental disease. She doesn‚Äôt need to be in such an extreme situation like a conservatorship if she is able to remember her dance steps.
787,2020-01-24 04:25:04,eswxy2,She does have a serious mental illness
788,2020-01-24 07:43:37,eswxy2,"I just feel like if her mental health was first priority, then she wouldn't be doing mentally taxing (even for stable minded performers) emotionally taxing, physically taxing shows for years. She would be reclused and doing major self work. Not showcasing in Vegas. Britney Spears is definitely the victim here. Her dad doesn't give a fuck imo. This is some Shirley temple shit. She possibly has a mental illness because of her traumatic childhood and upbringing. Poor thing was forced to perform since she was 8 years old. Consistently. It never stopped once it began. Financial/fame Goal minded parents like her's aren't to be comended, they're to be shamed. Children aren't paychecks.  


 And also..


How many people under an underpass can put on nightly shows in fucking Vegas and can still be profiled as unstable to the point of choosing the crevice of a bridge as their home? Makes no sense."
789,2020-01-23 22:40:02,eswxy2,Yeah I hate that people are obsessed with this conspiracy.  She is not well.  She does not have primary custody of her children - and we all know there is a bias favoring women when it comes to custody.  Her instragram? Very bizarre videos of her working out in pajama shorts that look like she has owned since she was 10 or trying on different outfits.  Has she been unfairly treated or controlled by people around her in her life? Probably.  But she does not seem capable of taking care of herself.
790,2020-01-24 07:09:29,eswxy2,"Britney's fanbase reminds me of Marilyn Monroe's fanbase. There is a subset of people who want to defend her especially because they view both as vulnerable women in a predatory industry. They're not especially wrong. But you're right that there's no real mystery here, it's obvious to anyone who is paying attention. The befuddling thing for me are the people who defend her team, when it is obvious they don't have her best interests in mind."
791,2020-01-24 09:00:13,eswxy2,I don‚Äôt think it would make a difference at this point but quite possibly.

796,2020-01-24 04:59:41,eswxy2,Wild speculation there.
797,2020-01-24 05:56:09,eswxy2,"I believe this based on rumors I heard from people whose children went to Parklane Academy in Liberty, MS with the Spears kids & know extended family members well. Britney was very unwell in 2007 and Britney off her treatment plan/meds today will/would probably still be very unwell.  (And obviously she shouldn‚Äôt be forced to perform/work in that state so people can make money off of her.)"
798,2020-01-24 07:52:25,eswxy2,"She has the mind set of a child because she has been abused since she was a child by her parents. I can guarantee it. No loving parent would subject their child to that type of life and scrutiny. You couldn't pay me anything to sell my child like that. 

This is tragic. I can't believe I didn't know about this until tonight. I thought it was an isolated moment in her life when she lost her boys and she got better and gained custody back. Holy shit is this fucked up."

805,2020-01-23 19:05:03,eswxy2,Do they bring it up a lot?
806,2020-01-23 18:45:11,eswxy2,"IIRC she shaved it because they had it in a contract that she wasn't allowed to change it at all. She was rebelling against that level of control in her life. Which, if true, I wouldn't blame her for in the least. I'd rather have no hair than someone dictate that I keep the same style for however many years."
807,2020-01-23 19:14:06,eswxy2,She said (confirmed by her hairdresser and the person who drove her to the shop) that she shaved it out of frustration because they had used a hair weave process that used glue to attach hair extensions to her existing hair and it was taking too long to grow out/remove.
808,2020-01-23 19:23:38,eswxy2,I remember she had some pretty janky extensions at the time.  I always assumed she got sick of dealing with them and her hair was a wreck from them so she just shaved it off.
809,2020-01-23 19:11:33,eswxy2,What about eyebrows? Couldn't those still be used? No idea just conjecture.
810,2020-01-23 18:44:15,eswxy2,"drug testing for what... ? lol it's not like she was trying to get a job with the government. if she had drugs in her system who would care?

edit: I guess it was custody of her kids. ok makes more sense but stupid because they can test in many ways. sorry all"
811,2020-01-23 19:23:10,eswxy2,I had heard that she shaved it because her hair extensions were causing hair loss.
812,2020-01-23 19:41:13,eswxy2,I also heard it was an act of rebellion because people were always coming over and fussing with her hair and touching it without asking her.
813,2020-01-23 19:05:48,eswxy2,"I've heard that rumor as well, and it kinda makes sense considering the circumstances at the time."

815,2020-01-24 06:05:46,eswxy2,What was the conspiracy about her voice?
816,2020-01-24 13:35:41,eswxy2,"I thought about that as well but she could be too afraid.  If she is as mentally unstable as I fear, someone looking out for her best interest would have warned her that by reaching out to the public for help, her secret would come out.  Her team would have to defend their actions through the justice system and her medical records would no longer be sealed.   The shame of admitting to the world that she has severe mental illness would be bad but nothing compared to the worry of losing her fans.   I‚Äôm not saying her fans would turn on her, it‚Äôs just this would be her fear.    All her life has been about keeping up the persona to stay on top.  On the other hand, if she isn‚Äôt that bad off and a truly a prisoner, she has years of mental conditioning.   She‚Äôs probably been told ‚ÄúNo one will believe you‚Äù or ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll make you sound crazy and put you back in a psych ward.  You‚Äôll lose all contact with your boys.‚Äù"

819,2020-01-23 19:46:33,eswxy2,You still have hair follicles if you shave your head. They could‚Äôve done a blood or urine test for drugs too.

820,2020-01-23 19:38:06,eswxy2,Charlie Sheen pulled the same stunt while in a custody battle.

It‚Äôs incredibly difficult to stick to even the least restrictive of diets. Taking medications at the same time everyday becomes a math problem. Basically everyone gets sick at some point (or runs a low grade fever the whole time.)

It would be one thing for her to maintain a recording schedule at home. That could be a healthy routine. Nothing about touring is ever routine."
833,2020-01-23 19:01:33,eswxy2,"It's all she knows because her father sees her as a cash cow. She isn't that mentally ill, he's using it as an excuse to control her. Also, what routine?"

I'm so sorry that happened to your friend. Mental health definitely needs to be taken more seriously than it is."

838,2020-01-23 20:13:51,eswxy2,There‚Äôs plenty of mystery surrounding her current situation in my opinion and the opinion of many others. You should read up on it if you think there isn‚Äôt as her Instagram and who‚Äôs responsible for posting is somewhat of a mystery in itself. There have been reports (even by her ex fianc√© if I remember correctly) that she doesn‚Äôt even have a data plan and her phone is essentially just used as a camera.
839,2020-01-24 05:40:44,eswxy2,This is what I think too. Just because she is rich she doesn't get to make her own mistakes? If she wanted to go down the wrong path that should have been her choice to make.
840,2020-01-24 13:19:12,eswxy2,You're not wrong. Who tf cares?? Rich people are usually manipulative and controlling. Mystery solved.

843,2020-01-23 19:35:29,eswxy2,"I have heard from some sources that she has HIV.

Edit: not AIDS, HIV"
844,2020-01-23 23:25:39,eswxy2,"It‚Äôs obvious she was put on the spot and questioned about a very recent emotional issue while cameras are rolling in a room full of cameras, staff and producers. 

She‚Äôs trying to choke back tears; and embarrassed she‚Äôs about to cry on camera. She‚Äôs deferring. Trying to make light of it and it‚Äôs not working. She literally says she‚Äôs embarrassed and asks to cut the camera. 

Conspiracy or not this is very normal behavior. It‚Äôs hard enough if you happen to get emotional in a public place; it‚Äôs a whole new level when you‚Äôre getting emotional in front of the whole world. 

Let me guess... you‚Äôre male?"
845,2020-01-24 01:19:41,eswxy2,"This isn‚Äôt long after her breakup with Justin Timberlake and was also during the peak of her career where she had been working nonstop, touring, and releasing 4 albums in 5 years.

854,2020-01-24 06:50:06,eswxy2,"Her entire situation reeks of MKUltra Monarch shit.  I know that its often seen as insane tinfoil hat thing, but its pretty real stuff when you start digging into some of the declassified CIA documents and read into it.  A lot of the mental problems she's had over the years elude to it.  Her along with a growing number of current female pop stars.  Given the issues with her dad wouldn't be at all surprised to find out he traded his daughter in for a more lavish lifestyle provided by industry monsters."

857,2020-01-23 18:41:04,eswxy2,Yes. My husband always kind of smirks at me when I rave about how well a child star turned out (Fred Savage comes to mind) when so many of them go off the deep end.

Just keep in mind it was recorded a while back and therefore not been updated with any new information, if any, since then"
864,2020-01-23 21:56:31,eswxy2,"Yes, I took voice lessons back in the early-mid 2000s. My voice coach and I were talking about different singers and she said that Britney is going to ruin her voice if she keeps singing like that. She has a very naturally pretty voice- but whenever my voice teacher would hear her sing in the 'baby' tone, she would cringe because she knew that it was damaging her vocal chords."
865,2020-01-24 08:26:08,eswxy2,"And when you think about *why* that baby voice was insisted upon. At the beginning of her career she was brazenly marketed as jailbait, complete with open public discussion about her virginity etc. Even without knowing a single thing about her relationship with her parents you can look back at the very beginning of her fame and strongly suspect someone(s) was not looking out for her."
866,2020-01-23 19:15:18,eswxy2,I'm sure the chain smoking she used to do probably didn't help either. Everything about the whole situation with Britney Spears is depressing af.
867,2020-01-24 03:15:20,eswxy2,"There was gossip that her handlers don‚Äôt like her real voice, considers it manly hence why they made her sing so pitchy to match their image they had of an all innocent wholesome girl and reading how an exec just loved how she rolled her eyes back when she sings to Max Martin making her sing one word at a time so he can pick the best takes to compile together. It sucks because she‚Äôs a pleaser as it seems and a hard worker so she would try to do the best she can."
868,2020-01-24 03:53:45,eswxy2,I overheard a woman at a restaurant a couple months back bragging about how she bullied Britney in PA Middle school. It wasn't one of those terrible bullying stories but mean girl enough. Just thought I'd share.

870,2020-01-23 20:28:14,eswxy2,I beg to differ. Britney was always a performer not a singer.
871,2020-01-24 16:21:16,eswxy2,There‚Äôs actually audio of her singing without auto tune. [It‚Äôs rough] (https://youtu.be/MUdKrtsrCBI).
872,2020-01-24 01:42:39,eswxy2,That is what it seems like. I always thought that her team would approach the guys she seemed to have interest in and set up that kind of arrangement. She's had several boyfriends that seem more like babysitters.

876,2020-01-24 15:14:09,eswxy2,You should check her tiktok account. That one just creeps me out.
877,2020-01-24 03:55:00,eswxy2,"The South Park episode about her during that time pretty much nailed it. To anyone who hasnt seen it, ""Britney"" shoots herself in the head and literally walks around with a half-severed head and the paps/media still swarm her. It's kinda unnerving but it just felt so accurate.

To quote Chris Crocker, LEAVE BRITNEY ALONE!"

Anyways he said she was his favorite ever to work with, excellent singer, one of the few who actually knew how to sing and worked well in a studio. He did say that she looked terrified when he pulled his phone out to show her something, she was afraid he was going to take her picture and he said the look of panic she gave showed him just how bad people had messed with her over the years, didn‚Äôt trust anyone."

883,2020-01-24 05:00:18,eswxy2,"Christina was and has been very active. I think in her case she was marketed as less of a sex kitten than Britney and less prone to irrational behavior, so things mostly went better for her.

Mandy Moore was trapped in an emotionally abusive marriage to Ryan Adams for a million years.

Jessica Simpson's dumb schtick got old, she divorced her famous husband, and faded from sight. She was not as beautiful or as talented a singer as the others, to boot."
884,2020-01-24 14:29:02,eswxy2,Honestly they were not on the same level. Everyone was chasing Britney Spears. I'm not a fan of the genre but now a few Spears songs where as Christina was more of a one or 2 hit wonder.

890,2020-01-23 22:42:52,eswxy2,"The judge doesn't diagnose her condition. When they petitioned the court for a conservatorship they brought evidence from the doctors that were treating her. I don't know what the eventual diagnosis was for her but apparently it was compelling enough for the court to grant them the conservatorship. 

Personally I think that she is dealing with some very serious mental health issues and her current situation isn't in her best interest. If she's not competent enough to take care of herself she shouldn't be paraded around like a show pony and forced to live such a public life."
891,2020-01-24 10:22:55,eswxy2,"In fairness having worked in dementia care, I've met plenty of 35+ year olds with early dementia."

900,2020-01-23 23:42:44,eswxy2,"So I'm the same age as britney and ain't no fucking was she has dementia,  but I'm also a nursing home employee and otherwise mostly nonverbal residents will LIGHT THE FUCK UP when they hear music they loved back in the day.  They'll sing and bop around as much as they can. I would imagine that maybe if someone DID develop dementia while they were that young and athletic they might be able to perform relatively well just because that's what they've always done. 

Or I'm stupid,  I dunno. 
I apologize for the caps lol."
901,2020-01-23 20:49:07,eswxy2,Her years of playing in the NFL took a toll on her brain.
902,2020-01-23 21:05:54,eswxy2,I don't think there's any question she was in the middle of a mental health crisis when that happened. I also think that's pretty understandable when you look at the absolute circus that has been surrounding her since childhood. It's just awful that the people she should be able to count on to support her are more interested in her check book than anything else.
903,2020-01-24 14:57:00,eswxy2,"I‚Äôve always been a little confused by that too, there‚Äôs no denying that Britney was acting out and seemed to have substance abuse problems when she was in her early 20‚Äôs, but I would have thought a lot of that could be chalked up to delayed teenage rebellion after spending most of her childhood working? The shaving her head as some kind of statement was an impulsive and crazy decision yes, but it was only such huge news because it was Britney Spears. And the attacking the car with the umbrella came about because of paps constantly flashing lights in her face at a time when she was already upset and on the edge, heck you often hear of male celebs lashing out and smashing cameras and they don‚Äôt get their mental health scrutinised in anything like the same way. It always seemed to me that all she needed was to go to rehab and get clean, and then take some time out of the spotlight. Not be held under a 24-7 conservatorship for the rest of her life  

It just worries me that there seems to be such a difference when you look at her now and how anxious and just off she comes across as, it‚Äôs like night and day when you look back at younger Britney. Even during the For The Record documentary after her breakdown, she still seemed recognisably her old self, and then compare it to say how out of it she looked during the Femme Fatale album for example, or the pictures of her from last year with the thousand yard stare. 

It doesn‚Äôt seem like the conservatorship has done anything whatsoever to improve her mental health imo. It was originally introduced as a temporary solution to get her back on track, and then it seemed to gradually switch into her being severely mentally impaired in the long term and unable to function. Just seems odd to me, especially when you look at how much money her team are making off signing her to perform in Vegas and record albums, and she apparently gets no say in her life at all any more. In which case she should not be working surely?"
904,2020-01-24 01:25:42,eswxy2,"It was more than that. I can‚Äôt remember a lot of details but a lot of disturbing behavior- attacking paparazzi, hit an run with no valid license, police called when she wouldn‚Äôt give the kids to her ex, lots of drinking & drugs, having that guy who was her ‚Äúmanager‚Äù but was drugging her and taking advantage."
905,2020-01-23 21:20:14,eswxy2,"I still have yet to educate myself on the whole concept of conservatorship, however wouldn't it be possible to have the control during a breakdown, and then giving her back her own autonomy after treatment?"
906,2020-01-24 06:32:44,eswxy2,She fell in with another group of scam artists who were drugging her and using her for money. Google Sam Lufti. The conservatorship was to purge him from her life.
907,2020-01-23 22:38:05,eswxy2,"at one point she had locked herself in the bathroom with her youngest when he was very young and refused to come out to give him to his dad for his custody time, police and ambulance had to be called, there are rumors she was threatening herself while locked in the bathroom. she was also papped driving with this same son on her lap when he was a baby. she was endangering her children and herself back then."
908,2020-01-24 12:44:52,eswxy2,Basically her parents drove her crazy and then her dad took advantage of the situation and became her conservator. And now he does the same thing with legal permission . He buys off people and doctors to keep the exploitation going.
909,2020-01-24 07:23:52,eswxy2,"She didn't shave her head because of mental illness, she shaved it to avoid a positive drug test from drugs she did months before. Kevin Federline threatened to have her drug tested in an effort to get custody of her kids. This is because if he had custody he would be eligible for hundreds of thousands of dollars per month instead of tens of thousands per month. Britney was on the wagon but had temporarily fallen off the wagon several months before and was afraid they would use a hair test and not a urine test."

912,2020-01-24 08:59:59,eswxy2,idk what you're commenting on but I just read this and it says prognosis is 10 years
913,2020-01-24 14:09:15,eswxy2,"In Britney‚Äôs case? She didn‚Äôt have a chance. Remember she started in the Mickey Mouse Show when she was a minor. 
She has been exploited her whole life."
914,2020-01-24 09:23:39,eswxy2,why doesn't anyone understand this?
915,2020-01-23 21:30:31,eswxy2,"I mean, that kinda makes sense, right?"
916,2020-01-24 09:03:39,eswxy2,This was an incredible piece of journalism that I think everyone should read.
917,2020-01-24 05:16:41,eswxy2,How is she posting on Instagram then?
918,2020-01-23 21:34:43,eswxy2,"Mentally ill and disabled people don't have the same rights in America, and it isn't talked about. That's part of the reason people fear seeking treatment that would basically manage their mental illness/depression/anxiety problems enough to allow them to live quality lives or continue to work; the stigma as well as the future possibility that someone could take them to court to take over their finances and freedom. 

It's doubly harmful because some psychiatric conditions, namely schizophrenia, is degenerative and causes cognitive function to drop over time if untreated. That's why the majority of homeless in the US are mentally ill.  

With a treatment plan and sometimes medication people don't get to that point and they keep their intellect and ability to function."
919,2020-01-23 21:16:05,eswxy2,"For someone to obtain conservatorship over another person, they have to prove that they are incompetent, that they do not have the capacity to care for themselves or their affairs in the most basic manner. 

The law has changed (see above), but it had been decided that people who were THAT incompetent couldn't vote, any more than they could stand trial."
920,2020-01-24 15:56:15,eswxy2,"That‚Äôs what stands out to me as well, she is so dead behind the eyes now that she seems like a completely different person. I always remember the first time I watched the Till The World Ends music video which is supposed to be about Britney dancing the night away in an underground club, and it was so disturbing to me how she seemed to have no life about her at all, and her only ‚Äòdancing‚Äô consisted of standing in one spot and jerking her body. It‚Äôs hard to explain, but it just really stood out to me with the Femme Fatale music video‚Äôs especially that she so plainly did want to be there. I would say the same of many of her public performances at that time as well in fact when she seems so stiff and terrified, and your mind then wonders why she is therefore being signed up to do these albums and performances when she is supposedly so impaired that she cannot make any decisions for herself, clearly *someone* is making these decisions for her  

It‚Äôs also interesting to me that it rarely seems to get brought up that she only really came across in this dead behind the eyes kind of way *after* she was put under the lifelong conversationship that was supposed to help her. She was still recognisable as her old self to me during the For The Record documentary that was recorded during circus, and even her breakdown seemed at the time to be very treatable as it was mostly a result of substance abuse and lashing out at the heavy pressure and restrictions that she was under, especially the shaving her head incident. Heck attacking the paparazzi is something that male celebs have been known to do when it comes to smashing up theirs cameras, even punching them out of frustration! Britney took a swing at the car window with an umbrella and told them to go fuck yourself at a bad time for her when they were putting her under even more stress by following her and constantly flashing cameras in her face, and it‚Äôs treated as indisputable proof that she was out of her mind??

People talk now as if she was completely delusional during that time and letting her father take control was the only solution, but even of the worst of the incidents (being sectioned after locking herself in the bathroom out of fear that her kids were going to be taken away by Kevin‚Äôs lawyer) can be explained by Sam Lufti apparently drugging and gaslighting her. She never threatened to kill her kids or anyone else, it always seemed like all she really needed back then was rehab and some time away from the spotlight, it‚Äôs just sad now to to look at current Britney under her fathers care"
921,2020-01-24 14:49:35,eswxy2,"Same here! Born in 93, and I think most American girls our age share the experience of watching Britney, to an extent the Backstreet Boys and *NSYNC, Justin Timberlake‚Äôs solo career, etc really explode. I remember doing karaoke to her first album and getting really sad when I heard the lyrics to Lucky. That was when I kind of first understood that celebrities are people too even though they‚Äôre essentially manufactured for us to consume. 

I agree that she seems to be both severely distressed and under a shady amount of control. If she‚Äôs ill enough to warrant conservatorship she shouldn‚Äôt have a fucking grueling Vegas residency, and if she‚Äôs well enough to manage that crazy hectic life she‚Äôs not ill enough to be under conservatorship!

927,2020-01-24 17:05:15,eswxy2,"I‚Äôve been thinking this the whole time.  Yes, it does keep money coming in, but I agree that Britney enjoys and wants to perform, and it gives her something to do every day."
928,2020-01-24 13:39:39,eswxy2,"If she is requiring constant 24/7 care then that is a lot of money. Add on the astronomical child support, and having 2 kids, and her properties, etc. I mean, that has to be paid for somehow. Money eventually runs out even if you have a lot. I think she should he moved somewhere quiet where no one knows her and she can downsize, however, she has two sons. That isnt a feasible option. It might hurt her more to be away from them, and she also needs security, etc. I dont understand HOW she performs, but being stationed in Las Vegas with a set routine, a set work schedule...I dont see that as a horrible idea. It keeps her busy, gives her purpose, and it's all she knows. It would possibly be much worse for her NOT to work, have nothing to do, and have mo routine."
929,2020-01-24 02:08:11,eswxy2,"Im(unprofessional)o it's so common for child stars to present with some type of mental illness or other issues that something they go through - the stress, exposure/media presence, abuse of any kind, whatever - changes them. The longer kids are kept in the industry and the more exposed they are/less of a normal live they live they worse off they seem to be.

Even Miley displays alarming behavior to me, and for a while she seemed so ""normal"" for someone who grew up how she did. But she hit a point where it all started to crumble and her behavior since has been questionable. Her instagram page for a while there was... something else. Before she deleted it all and had a more wholesome image again, but since her divorce and that time it's gotten crazier again."
930,2020-01-24 11:24:43,eswxy2,Drug use and emotional trauma can bring out and exacerbate underlying mental conditions. She likely had some mental health issues to begin with but drugs/life made the conditions worse.
931,2020-01-24 09:18:04,eswxy2,"Unfortunately, even if all of her symptoms do stem from her circumstances, it doesn't mean that changing the circumstances now would fix it. Each of the things she has gone through has the potential of ""breaking"" a person permanently, especially drug use - both illegal AND prescription. Or it's also likely that she had some underlying genetic predisposition to some illness that would not have surfaced if she didn't have the life she had, or would have presented with much less severe symptoms"

Most people looking up at Amy or Britney think they have it all, because that's what we are led to believe. So in turn, when they see them 'screwing' up they see it as squandering their opportunity and taking their success for granted. But the reality is, all the money in the world doesn't solve any fundamental individual problems. It's just not possible. Mo money mo problems, as they say. You have to deal with the constant pressure to be great and the constant ridicule when you don't meet someone's expectations. I think it would be horrible to be that famous, yet so many strive to get there for some reason.

939,2020-01-24 07:15:55,eswxy2,"Omg the public‚Äôs opinion on Amy Winehouse gave me whiplash and baffles me to this day

I remember in the LiveJournal days how much people would trash her on celeb forums. Floods of posts mocking her behavior and trashing her completely relentlessly. The only thing that kept Amy trending at that time was just how much people could talk about her very public and messy mental illness and drug addiction. 

After she died, she immediately crossed over into revered icon. Everyone talks about how tragic her life was. You‚Äôll often find her on people‚Äôs all time greatest lists. 

To this day I‚Äôm still thinking ‚ÄúShe had that one breakout hit, and everyone noticed ‚Äòoh hey she‚Äôs kinda fucked up‚Äô and made fun of her from then on and NOW they wanna come back and reminisce about her beautiful voice?

I‚Äôm not proud of the ways I chose to cope at that age, but if I had to see it talked about and scrutinized as if I wasn‚Äôt a real person but a dancing monkey expected to always be perfect, I think it would break me down in the same way."
945,2020-01-23 20:29:43,eswxy2,"I totally agree!

946,2020-01-24 08:37:34,eswxy2,"Man i have a lot to say about this whole topic (Britney) but THANK YOU for mentioning this. Even today if you read the Wikipedia article on the Baby One More Time video, the responsibility for the ""sexiness"" of it is put entirely on Britney's own head. ""She"" chose the schoolgirl uniforms, ""she"" chose to tie up her shirt to show her belly etc.

She was 15-16 when that video was shot. And every single adult involved, including her own parents, was A-OK with portraying her sexy virgin jailbait. Even if it was Britney's idea to do all that, that;s the part where an adult steps in and says something. 

The imagery surrounding that first album was so creepy. The cover is practically an upskirt. Then there were those magazine covers and shoots, including one of her in a pink child-style bedroom, cuddling stuffed animals in her panties etc.

Everything that's happened to her life seems like something out of a gothic novel, it's insane that it all went on in the spotlight, under everyone's noses, and the culture kinda just shrugged.

This girl can't even, as someone said above, legally buy herself a bottle of water. She was judged that incompetent. So she can't consent to that but she apparently can consent to sexual relationships with these boyfriends who have to first be vetted by her dad? It's all so fucking gross."
947,2020-01-24 08:49:04,eswxy2,"Well
..the school uniform and everything was her idea. The producers actually had a very different video in mind before Britney pitched her idea.

I drove 3 hours to go to one of his band's shows (was friends with other band members too), and they apologized for how he was acting because she was there. He barely took 5 minutes to say hi to me before the venue opened, had a look of deep disappointment on his eyes when she interrupted saying, ""Cant you talk to your *fans* some other time?"" all sarcastic like. *Bitch, I've know him since early high school-- I just drove 3 hours to come to this show to congratulate his band's new signing... because he is my ***friend*** and I care about his life*.

Top level performers with any sort of issues are forced to have a 24/7 team with them as a part of their insurance. Amy Winehouse was able to kick drugs only after she had two minders either side of her every time she left the house. They would physically move anyone who approached her out of the way
973,2020-01-23 22:16:59,eswxy2,"FWIW, (and take this with a grain of salt because it‚Äôs rumor) I was told by someone who had children who attended the same school in Liberty, MS that Jamie Lynn attended (as well as Britney and her brother, before she quit school for her career) & has known the extended Spears family for years that Britney has [rapid cycling bipolar](https://www.verywellmind.com/rapid-cycling-explanation-380488) and her bipolar has even caused delusions/psychosis. I  believe she is/was very sick and that she might have died in 2007 had her family not intervened to get her under conservatorship. At that time, Jamie Lynn was a new teen mom and Lynne (her mom) had a lot on her plate with that, so it made sense Jamie (who had been sober for a bit by then) would be the one to be her conservator. I do believe that saved her life and she would have spiraled so far that death would have happened in 2007.  


That said, the fact that she has been performing and working to make millions while under the conservatorship is sketchy as well as other things that have gone on in the following 13 years that she‚Äôs been under it. People have made millions off of this woman who allegedly can‚Äôt be trusted to own a smart phone. That‚Äôs not right. And the recent stuff with Jamie and her sons, etc is deeply troubling. But I do think Britney was very ill at the time when it was instituted.  


I wish Britney could move back to Louisiana, open a dance studio for kids or something, and live a normal-ish ‚Äúlocal celebrity‚Äù type life  where she can make her own decisions and not get flack for them in the media. I don‚Äôt think she wants to be a trained monkey performing for the conservatorship‚Äôs $$$ and I think she deserves a chance to step away and try to live as normal a life as possible as an adult who manages her mental illness (as many of us do) away from Hollywood."
974,2020-01-23 19:49:27,eswxy2,">I read that she was never formally diagnosed as bipolar either but I believe the source who contacted the Britney Gram girls said she is given bipolar medication anyway

You can't look at someone's meds and work backwards from there to puzzle out their diagnosis. Mental health prescriptions have a lot of overlap between diagnoses, because they're treating the symptoms you present. 

Someone with bipolar is usually prescribed an SSRI/SNRI and an antipsychotic. That same combo can be prescribed for a bunch of other situations: someone with schizoaffective disorder, someone who has clinical depression with hypomanic episodes that don't meet the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for bipolar, someone with very severe depression, or someone who has depression and another comorbid illness treated with antipsychotics such as ADHD, an eating disorder, PTSD, OCD or anxiety."
975,2020-01-23 19:55:25,eswxy2,"It‚Äôs really easy to be diagnosed as bipolar. It wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if she received the diagnosis by a doctor who didn‚Äôt even hardly look at her and put her on meds. Psych meds can really screw you up, especially if you don‚Äôt need them."
976,2020-01-24 04:04:24,eswxy2,"Isn‚Äôt her sister married and is keeping a low profile? I heard a country song she did and it was actually really good. She girl can sing. She sounds like what Britney would sound like if they actually let her use her real singing voice. If that makes sense.

That could very well be happening in this circumstance. 

I can‚Äôt remember her name, but a woman who was a journalist, I think, wrote about how she was experiencing some anxiety and they gave her meds which pushed her into psychosis. Instead of identifying the meds as the problem, they just continued giving her more meds. She had to quit her job and I believe ended up on full time disability. Eventually, a doctor saw what was happening and started weaning her off the meds and guess what? Her psychosis disappeared and she became a fully functioning adult again."

1007,2020-01-23 22:49:34,eswxy2,"The hair follicle is under/in the skin. She cut off her strands, doesn't affect a follicle test.

*I'm wrong"
1008,2020-01-24 01:43:46,eswxy2,"> She shaved her head because her ex Kevin Federline wanted her to take a follicular drug test.

Can you explain this more? I never heard it before"
1009,2020-01-24 16:08:12,eswxy2,i could be wrong but i think it has come out that Sam Lutfi was the one who wrote these letters? unless it‚Äôs a different set of letters that he wrote impersonating her
1010,2020-01-24 05:00:38,eswxy2,I think most of the letter scans can be found [here](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7086731/Britney-Spears-claims-never-seen-letter-silenced-threatened-team.html).
1011,2020-01-24 01:22:10,eswxy2,"Following, id like to read this as well."
1012,2020-01-24 07:48:24,eswxy2,"Probably because she cant stand being in the chair for elaborate stage makeup. She probably became so difficult that they offered to tattoo it on to make it permanent and not so much work every night, but perhaps it was so painful that she was moving and struggling a lot during the procedure. It makes sense."
1013,2020-01-24 13:47:06,eswxy2,Whatttt
1014,2020-01-24 03:42:18,eswxy2,Most definitely
1015,2020-01-23 22:44:57,eswxy2,You really got my hopes up with that one
1016,2020-01-24 13:18:06,eswxy2,"I just finished reading her autobiography a few weeks ago. It was really good. 

She's active on social media I think, and still doing stuff. She paid off all the debt I believe."
1017,2020-01-24 13:56:26,eswxy2,"He said recently that during her whole breakdown, his producers wanted him to jump on the bandwagon of making jokes about Britney. He had the Late Late Show at the time. He refused because he didn't want to ""pile it on"". Really classy move"
1018,2020-01-24 14:15:34,eswxy2,You know that Marina Joyce video that blew up because people were saying she was being made to do the videos against her will? I get the same vibes from Britney's ig as I did from that video.
1019,2020-01-24 07:23:23,eswxy2,She's dead because she doesn't have her children and is possibly over medicated. Just my two cents. A mother without her children is dead in her soul.
1020,2020-01-24 08:42:24,eswxy2,"It‚Äôs amazing to me that you are still reading comments and I appreciate your response. You are truly dedicated in your quest. 

This just makes me wonder what other modern enigmas Black Mirror based their Dystopian futures off of."
1021,2020-01-24 05:26:23,eswxy2,"that's very generous of you, but I think it's more about the money for Jamie. That he's just scared of losing her doesn't fit to me? His behavior for the last 13 years shows tells us doesn't give a shit about what Britney wants or needs, and that's just what we know publically... which is next to nothing. I think everyone in britney's legal circle is money hungry."
1022,2020-01-24 04:14:30,eswxy2,He‚Äôs probably right
1023,2020-01-24 15:36:59,eswxy2,That's not really a solution.
1024,2020-01-24 14:26:09,eswxy2,"Yeah, super sad."
1025,2020-01-23 22:41:36,eswxy2,"Well, there‚Äôs a lot this post hasn‚Äôt mentioned; I personally think it‚Äôs way more than just mental illness. She may have some kind of condition, but certainly not one that prohibits her from living for herself and requiring a conservator. How can you have an illness that debilitating and be forced to perform on endless tours like a show monkey? 

That‚Äôs not even taking into account the fact that her father is a known alcoholic, and receives a paycheck of $130k just for his role as conservator. That Britney disappeared from the public for months, and her own mother liked comments about Britney ‚Äúbeing held against her will‚Äù and criticizing the conservatorship. When Britney has met with directors, her only requests were to be kept in a cage, and to die. A voicemail in 2009, in which she speaks with lawyers, asking for the conservatorship to end but saying that her father threatened to take away her children. 

Britney can‚Äôt drive her own car or vote. She couldn‚Äôt leave the house doing her own hair. Shaving her head is seen as a mental break to us but it is the most free she has been since the late 90s."
1026,2020-01-23 23:24:45,eswxy2,"Even if what you're saying is correct, don't you think a conservatorship was extreme at the time it was assigned? She was being followed relentlessly by paps 24/7 for years, endured a very high profile break up, got pregnant (watching your body change takes its toll, not to mention PPD). With everything considered, could they really say it was mental illness so quickly? Why not help her in other ways and see if things calm down once the drama in her life settles? I just think it's a sad state of affairs when a women is deemed ""insane"" for shaving her head.. probably the least offensive act I could imagine someone doing when stressed. Not to mention she was supposed to be taking a drug test which would influence her custody situation with her sons. A lot of people don't think it was a coincidence, and she shaved so she couldn't do a hair test."
1027,2020-01-23 19:42:06,eswxy2,"Her Instagram posts are so weird, something is off with her I just don't know what."
1028,2020-01-24 16:41:06,eswxy2,See their comment history. They updated.
1029,2020-01-23 20:33:49,eswxy2,"This is my thought exactly, I follow a cringe/surrealist meme account that always shares her videos and it just seems to me that Britney is really bored and just trying to have fun and feel pretty. There may be a touch of mania there but it‚Äôs nothing that requires constant supervision."
1030,2020-01-23 21:13:25,eswxy2,[deleted]
1031,2020-01-23 20:10:44,eswxy2,"I agree completely. Enough psych meds will screw anyone up and make them seem mentally ill, whether they are or not. 

I was put on a psych med that threw me into a manic episode (my first and last one) and I was labeled as bipolar type 2. I had never been manic before and I haven‚Äôt been since being taken off of that med, but the diagnosis stuck and I can‚Äôt shake it. I‚Äôm not on any meds now and I‚Äôm doing just fine by going to my therapist and talking through my depression and anxiety. 

People don‚Äôt understand that the mentally ill can and should be able to advocate for themselves. They think that just because someone is on a psych med, they‚Äôre not to be trusted when reporting their own symptoms. That results in being over medicated quite a bit, in my opinion. 

There was a woman who wrote about being anxious so she was put on a psych med. The med caused her to have psychotic symptoms, so instead of attributing it to the med, they assumed she had psychosis and started piling on med after med. she ended up on complete disability. Eventually she found herself at a doctor who was shocked at the number of meds she was on and began to wean her off, and surprise, surprise! Her symptoms went away. She‚Äôs a fully functioning adult now. I wish I knew her name. She wrote an article and maybe even a book about it. 

People don‚Äôt understand just how much psych meds can mess up a person. While they do help, they can also be SO dangerous."
1032,2020-01-24 00:07:30,eswxy2,Basically what Sharon Osborne did to Ozzy to keep the show running.
1033,2020-01-24 00:06:26,eswxy2,"I doubt that.  I took a friend's antipsychotic once on a dare and it knocked me out, I was a zombie for a couple days.  I was not acting 'weird', I just had very little mental energy and consequently very little physical energy, lethargic, apathetic, I'd drift into reverie where I was literally in a reverie over nothing, just a couple day-dreamy hours had passed and I'd have no idea what I'd been actually thinking about the whole time, if anything."
1034,2020-01-24 00:23:16,eswxy2,She's ten years older.
1035,2020-01-24 06:45:14,eswxy2,"It could be that her team is so out of touch that they assume her fans still want to see Britney as she once was in her prime, so they tell Britney to act like a kid. But Britney is a much older woman now and people want to see her age gracefully, so it just comes across as unnatural and a little cringey."
1036,2020-01-24 03:50:34,eswxy2,"Someone who went to the tappings said she is always shuttled out during breaks surrounded by an army. I would be nervous all the time too especially when your handlers are off to the side ready to swoop in if you say something wrong. Many media outlets have complained about how controlling her team is like requesting final approval of articles and allowing them the ability to edit anything they want and that includes videos. I feel she‚Äôs actually the sane one in her circle. Every time people talk about working with Britney, they talk about how chill she is but complains about her team."
1037,2020-01-23 19:27:50,eswxy2,I think part of that is being asked for an opinion and knowing people are actually listening. I think she's never been asked her opinion on any kind of important decision for her own life and now she's on TV being asked to make enormous seeming decisions for other people? Huge pressure.
1038,2020-01-23 22:30:18,eswxy2,Like what is her story even about? Britneyzone? What??
1039,2020-01-23 22:27:45,eswxy2,aw jeez poor thing
1040,2020-01-23 19:28:11,eswxy2,Pretty sure her issues revolve more around her mental state than drugs. I think she had a breakdown partially because every aspect of her life was being controlled and partially because she had some legitimate mental issues that were (and probably still are) going untreated.
1041,2020-01-23 19:14:29,eswxy2,"Mental illnesses like bipolar disorder and schizophrenia often don‚Äôt present in women until their 20s. She may have been suffering mildly before, but I‚Äôm sure fame and pressure didn‚Äôt help. I agree that she‚Äôs very clearly ill and it‚Äôs extremely sad."
1042,2020-01-23 19:13:10,eswxy2,She was very young at that time; mental illness is often dormant until the mid-20s or so.
1043,2020-01-23 19:20:19,eswxy2,"I‚Äôve thought she‚Äôs had it together for a while. She had been taking care of her sons after the parenting courses and being very involved in their interests and just a very engaged parent overall, at least form what I‚Äôve seen. 

I think that it doesn‚Äôt need to be drugs, and that if even half of what seems to be going on with the abuse and control she‚Äôs been forced to endure, then her off behavior makes a lot of sense. Trauma can make people do seemingly odd things, and the baby voice thing may just be her rebelling again from being forced to do that her whole life. I‚Äôve also heard some people speculate the voice is actually edited."

1047,2020-01-24 02:24:49,eswxy2,Wait for real?
1048,2020-01-24 04:19:19,eswxy2,Men ate it up
1049,2020-01-24 08:36:00,eswxy2,"Yeah, they played 14 year old me like a fiddle.  They knew exactly what they were doing."
1050,2020-01-24 07:19:39,eswxy2,I see that now. It's disgusting.
1051,2020-01-24 00:07:34,eswxy2,"A conservatorship isn't a medical treatment. Analyzing the ""effects"" and ""results"" makes no sense to me. It's going down some weird legal rabbit hole."
1052,2020-01-24 14:34:57,eswxy2,"Nah, having a family and support system who know you have mental illness and dont want you to kill yourself because you arent in a stable frame of mind isnt going against the right to die movement. What a fucked up world to live in where it's considered wrong to not let your loved ones with addiction and mental illness destroy themselves and leave children with no mother. I mean really, think about that. You are free to make your own mistakes, but having medical issue and addictions arent mistakes. They can be treated and helped. It is neglect NOT to help that person."
1053,2020-01-24 07:48:14,eswxy2,"Well guess that bring up the entire right to die debate.  And I'm not sure if this is the forum haha.  I might agree with you, but the ming should be sound and it csnt be on drugs.  Kind of a chicken and egg thing"

1057,2020-01-24 06:51:44,eswxy2,"Kevin is someone who, like anyone is advantageous, a great opportunist. And like you also pointed out, it doesn't make him a good person. Britney definitely made mistakes too. She never got blowback for that relationship in the same way Angela Jolie did, she essentially broke up a relationship."
1058,2020-01-24 15:03:18,eswxy2,"It absolutely breaks my heart. Love and Mercy makes me cry every time. A beautiful and heartbreaking depiction of someone falling into mental illness and the lengths people in power will go to abuse it for their own gain. It's really an amazing movie (with amazing sound design if that's your jam). It's cathartic, with a wonderful ending. Couldn't recommend it enough."

1062,2020-01-23 20:38:46,eswxy2,"> Source?  
  
Eyes?"
1063,2020-01-24 14:37:25,eswxy2,Thanks!
1064,2020-01-24 14:53:38,eswxy2,"Right. Is the judge in on this, did she not have her own lawyer, and u can't just appoint someone to take over for u, they need to be vetted by the courts and if the dude is literally currently investigated for conservatorship fraud why tf would he be allowed to take over? So many questions..."
1065,2020-01-24 06:55:05,eswxy2,"Agreed, that is one stressful ass job to be such a workhorse and manage such a large estate, having a team work around you 24/7. It makes no sense to say she can't drive but she can pull off such a demanding residency with her condition."
1066,2020-01-23 22:34:43,eswxy2,"Her mother is a vulture who was in with Sam Lufti and brought dr. Phil to the hospital with her when Britney was admitted for a 5150 hold. Britney cut off contact with her at that point. 

Her mother is ""speaking out"" because she wants Britney's money."
1067,2020-01-24 06:02:45,eswxy2,"Conservatorship abuse happens by avoiding courts, and testimony, and evidence. This is the exact opposite."
1068,2020-01-24 07:57:35,eswxy2,Nah not really... Her body looks great. And she has the money to buy any and all skin care treatments out there. She looks horrible because her soul is dead.
1069,2020-01-24 13:00:40,eswxy2,Can't argue with that.
1070,2020-01-23 20:11:34,eswxy2,"I think she does make some decisions, she just needs permission for big things."
1071,2020-01-23 20:34:00,eswxy2,"Like I said, she screwed up bad until she lost her rights and her dad took over. None of us know her personally, but I'm gonna assume that judging by her past actions and what just happened last year that the reason the judge keeps granting this is she probably still has some issues. It is sad, but I would rather her still have her life in order rather than go off the deep end again.

I said in another comment that she is not locked in the house she does go traveling, hiking, on dates, take her kids to on outings, see their spots games, etc. So she's basically being treated as a standard teenager, not a prisoner. Which is admittedly pretty humiliating when youre about 40, but luckily she does still get to have a life."
1072,2020-01-23 21:28:20,eswxy2,"Hey me too! Maybe I should have all my rights taken away! Hey, have you been acting weird? Better get you a conservatorship too! And you get a conservatorship! And you get a conservatorship! It's not fucking Opera, they're for people who can't fucking function."
1073,2020-01-23 20:43:05,eswxy2,"When you are mentally unwell, drugged out and a famous celebrity its not a good idea because she was unable to make good decisions. She may not have been using protection and most of the guys were nobodies who ended up using her. She could have ended up with disease or pregnant by someone awful.

I don't know about how often Kevin cheated or how irresponsible he was or who used, but this isn't about him and I'm not making a comparison to him or any other male because this isn't about slut shaming or double standards. But if you wanna bring him up as far as I know he has been with Victoria for about 10 years and has seemingly been a good dad to Britney's children and stepped up to the plate when she couldn't. He also has yet to sell her out in anyway. So I guess he's aight."
1074,2020-01-24 12:33:32,eswxy2,"There are lots of people under those underpasses who had jobs and skills until illness/addiction took hold. Everything Britney was doing, she was doing with an extreme amount of structure and support."
1075,2020-01-23 22:51:14,eswxy2,"I agree she's definitely not well although I can't profess to know anything about what her issues are, but to me the conspiracy of sorts is that she's still working and making a shit ton of money that is going to her conservator. If she is so unwell, why is she being worked like mad?"
1076,2020-01-24 00:18:31,eswxy2,"Agree that she's not well, and if she were not rich and just a regular person, she'd probably be sleeping under a bridge. I think what concerns people are the people who are supposed to be taking care of her. Her whole story has that whole being taken advantage of feel."
1077,2020-01-24 15:16:04,eswxy2,"Yeah, the fact that *Kevin Federline* got full custody of the kids speaks volumes about the facts of her case."
1078,2020-01-24 05:13:21,eswxy2,Does she still do fashion shows in the hallway of her house on IG?
1079,2020-01-24 09:01:43,eswxy2,"I suppose most fans wouldn‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening anyway, right?"
1080,2020-01-23 20:08:41,eswxy2,"I'm not talking about writing the songs, I'm talking about performing them."
1081,2020-01-24 07:55:54,eswxy2,"Interesting! & I agree with you. 
she may never be stable enough to break the conservatorship and thus it is what‚Äôs necessary and best‚Äîon the other hand, family is financially benefitting off of being her conservators. 

Also, when I used to work in Thousand Oaks (she lives there most of the year), she would sometimes come in to buy the most mundane things (a bottle of whatever purfume & leave). Always looked like secret service had arrived‚Äî4 identical black chevy tahoes parked along the curb outside cheesecake factory. Her crew is enormous because she has so many needs to be attended to. It‚Äôs sad she never got a chance to live her youth. I grew up listening to Britney, it‚Äôs sad but at the end of the day, if my partner didn‚Äôt have the VA, I doubt he‚Äôd be here with me. Britney has $ and at least has more resources for mental health than most. 

Fame must really be such a b*tch though. 

Which reminds me‚Äî former child star Amanda Bynes almost lit her dog on fire in Thousand Oaks down the street from my work too. She also has severe mental illness and I believe her mother is also her conservator."
1082,2020-01-23 19:09:05,eswxy2,No we do not often discuss Britney Spears. I think we talked about her like twice in 2019
1083,2020-01-23 19:17:18,eswxy2,Yeah I‚Äôve never heard about the drug testing being the reason. I‚Äôve always heard it was a rebellion/breakdown from the constant control everyone had over her. I think many people can relate to that.
1084,2020-01-23 19:52:41,eswxy2,"But then she turned around and got resin bond extensions the moment her hair was an inch long. I mean, shit, she still gets those hellish extensions to his day. To me, that theory doesn‚Äôt hold up. Fighting Kevin for custody and him threatening a drug test holds up, to me."
1085,2020-01-23 20:56:42,eswxy2,"Generally, I think the hairs have to be at least half an inch long, and they want 1.5"" length.  Though it's possible the courts might have access to different types of tests that can test shorter hairs."
1086,2020-01-23 19:00:27,eswxy2,"she was in a custody battle with Kevin Federline at the time.  Obviously shaving your head isn't going to help much, but maybe Britney believed it would."
1087,2020-01-23 19:00:26,eswxy2,I believe it was for custody of her kids.
1088,2020-01-23 19:08:59,eswxy2,The context of the rumor as I heard it was that she might lose custody of her kid(s) if she tested positive for drugs.
1089,2020-01-23 19:11:49,eswxy2,"This was around the time of Sam Lutfi. Who was, indeed, helping Britney partake in street drugs and yes, she thought shaving her head would ruin the drug test for custody."
1090,2020-01-23 19:00:42,eswxy2,Custody battle of her children. She was in the midst of going off the deep end and her ex was trying to get full custody.
1091,2020-01-23 19:09:43,eswxy2,It had to do with custody issues. I believe it was post-Kevin Federline divorce and they had been going back and forth in court in regards to custody.
1092,2020-01-24 15:37:27,eswxy2,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WL7ZS3rhtBk

The theory is that either she or someone else has her voice sped up to sound more high-pitched in recordings and videos when in reality she has a much deeper voice."
1093,2020-01-23 19:22:00,eswxy2,"I wouldn't argue with ya on that, but there could have been a method to the madness. Plus what OP said was that it wasn't meant to be public, it was made public by her bodyguard."
1094,2020-01-23 19:55:14,eswxy2,"Well I said in my comment that drugs would still show up in her hair after she was clean, meaning blood or urine wouldn't test positive but hair still would. If she had stopped using for a month, the follicle would test negative (AFAIK). The rest of her hair would test positive."
1095,2020-01-23 19:46:38,eswxy2,Why would Charlie Sheen be helped in any way by shaving Britney Spears' head?
1096,2020-01-24 13:23:53,eswxy2,"Yeah I can't say for sure but Dan Schneider is a weird dude to say the least. I just remember I looked into the Jamie Lynne scandal and it seemed plausible.

But yeah, Dan Schneider, creator of numerous live action Nickelodeon shows (biggest probably being iCarly) was a weird guy. At one time he used Nickelodeon's official twitter to request children to send pictures of their feet. If you're a kid it seems like some goody Nick thing...but as an adult you look back and wonder why any grown man (or woman for that matter) would request children to take photos of their feet and send them to you. Then there's also the hot tub photos with numerous teen girls on Nick shows (in which he is always fully clothed...in the water) as well as just the episodic content and sexual nature of a lot of those shows. Weird af looking back it imo"
1097,2020-01-24 11:52:23,eswxy2,"Yes, if you have the resources and time and do a little digging into Schneider you will be disgusted. I wonder how much he contributed to Amanda Bynes' downward spiral. She's a victim in all this and not a nutcase she's portrayed to be."
1098,2020-01-23 20:26:55,eswxy2,Yeah this is exactly how I would react because being vulnerable crying in front of strangers would be super embarrassing
1099,2020-01-24 01:44:29,eswxy2,"But... she's not working? 

She checked in to a hospital last year (likely because her meds stopped working or she stopped taking them, both very normal) and cancelled her Vegas residency. 

A routine is a positive thing for many people with mental illness. It keeps them from falling into a depression or losing confidence in their abilities or contact with the wider world."
1100,2020-01-23 18:49:25,eswxy2,"And if Britney is indeed suffering from ""crippling mental illness""....is it really in her best interests for her conservatorship to be doing everything possible to maximize her (OK, really their) income regardless of her health?

Since they have the right to refuse medical treatment it is very difficult. Most do not like the side effects of their medications which is understandable, but without them they often go on to commit suicide or acts of violence. Others end up homeless with many families not knowing if they are even alive.

There are cases where those who have committed crimes due to mental health issues can be required to take their medications as a condition of their parole, but if they disappear law enforcement isn't likely to be able to do anything about it until they are arrested for another crime... sometimes simply loitering (aka having no place to go) Then they are placed in jails rather than treated for a medical condition.

That experience stuck with me. The only thing we as his friends could do was be supportive. We made arrangements towards the end for his dogs so he at least had the comfort of knowing they were being well cared for with people they knew. That seemed like very little. 

I am sure that wealthy celebrities are equally prone to these types of conditions. Genetics, substance abuse alterations to brain chemistry, and an abusive environment especially in early development are factors in most cases and are frequently seen in those who achieve fame too young. I imagine Britney Spears has had to deal with all of the above, and needs support from loving family and friends. I don't dispute that, but the prisoner in a facility complete with hashtag was/is horrible and so wrong. Let's hope some good comes out of the discussion. I thank you for your kindness and end with an alternate hashtag.

Beta programming gives people submissive skills to be used for sex. A person who has been programmed is not aware of these parts of themselves and has no control over them, they are controlled by handlers using triggers from the trauma. It is often speculated that celebrities who have breakdowns or act strangely in the public eye have broken their programming and going to hospital or rehab is a cover to reprogram them.

1192,2020-01-24 10:01:55,eswxy2,"I'm not sure. Most of what I know of mental illnesses is bipolar II related, as that's what I have. At first, I looked up the date she famously shaved her head, which was shortly after her 25th birthday; that's the most common age of diagnosis. But if she's got bipolar, her symptoms seem more in line with bipolar I to me, as this could have been her first (public) manic episode.

She might very well have something else, too. I'm rusty with these kinds of things.

I think this girl had a stressful, fucked up childhood, as many child stars do. I think the pressures of her fame and personal life caused a psychotic break, and I don't think she's been the same since. I think she is being taken advantage of as a cash cow instead of living out the rest of her life quietly. If she is surrounded by people 24/7, I think she must be on some heavy psych meds. I cannot imagine her being functional enough for her live performances without them.

I don't know how well off she is financially, but another thing I picked up on is her hair and makeup. Her hair looks unkempt and dirty, and she is still doing the smoky eye thing that hasn't been popular in years. She can afford a stylist to keep her looking fresh and trendy (as most famous people do), but she doesn't have one. She does mention in the caption of one video that she's working out extra since she ""gained two pounds."" What the fuck? It's weird to me how functional (to my knowledge) she is on stage but out-there in her Instagram videos. And despite her hair and makeup not seeming up to par with someone of her fame level, she has kept her body in shape--and judging by the ""two pound"" comment, I imagine obsessively so.

So to answer your question, yes, I personally think she is heavily medicated on prescription drugs. Whether or not she is under the conservatorship because A) she had mental health issues and her family exploited it to control her with drugs or B) her mental state has been so erratic since her public meltdown that she cannot be trusted to take care of herself, I'm not sure. Either way, I think she is at higher risk of hurting herself than most celebrities. I hope she has a few trustworthy people around her who genuinely care about her well-being and not just her money.

I tend to agree. Even kids who were only in the spotlight for a relatively short time seem to have periods where they go off the rails. 

For example, Brian Bonsall, who was in the spotlight for less than a decade as Andy on *Family Ties* and later as Alexander on *Star Trek: The Next Generation*, had a period in the late '00s where he was having issues with law enforcement. It might not have been directly related to his experiences on TV as a child, but I have to wonder if it was at least indirectly related."

I had a mental breakdown myself in college once. It was...bad. I was in a really dark place, but I was working a full time job on top of a grueling course schedule as well. They said stress and lack of sleep brought it on.

That was the darkest time of my life. My boyfriend now husband found me in a pool of blood after smashing a mirror.  I took a piece of the mirror and...you can read between the lines. 

I went to a hospital for two weeks and it was like a shade being lifted in a dark room. I was on medication for a few years, but am happy to say that I don‚Äôt rely on it anymore.  

I‚Äôm always scared I‚Äôll have one again whenever life gets to be too much.

1263,2020-01-24 12:52:47,eswxy2,"> She may have some kind of condition, but certainly not one that prohibits her from living for herself and requiring a conservator. How can you have an illness that debilitating and be forced to perform on endless tours like a show monkey?

I agree that it seems paradoxical and its hard to escape the notion that she's being used financially and otherwise.

That being said, it may be that Brittany has a complex kind of mental illness that only causes her to start to spiral if she's given free reign to make her own choices over some longer period of time.  She's not acutely out of control in the short term, but over time the effects of many small choices lead her into situations of acute crisis.  It's probably also amplified by her money and fame.

So under conservatorship that prevents the accumulation of bad personal decisions or circumstances and devoid of the ordinary demands of money and resources, she appears to thrive and can engage in high level behavior (touring, singing, etc).

It kind of makes me wonder what Spears would have been like if she had been an ordinary middle class woman.  Would she have even developed an acute mental health crisis without the pressures of fame and money, or just been kind of merely neurotic or suffered from some apparently mild depression?

How many apparently ordinary people would melt down if they rapidly became rich and famous?  Do they stay apparently normal because they're effectively as ""fenced in"" as Brittany Spears by the constraints and structure of everyday living?"
1264,2020-01-24 00:54:14,eswxy2,"She isn‚Äôt performing anymore, hasn‚Äôt for several years now, and may never perform again. 

$130k is a pretty trivial salary for managing the life and estate of your extremely famous adult daughter 24/7. In LA that barely counts as middle class. Guarantee you Britney‚Äôs agent and publicist took home a lot more for doing a lot less.

1270,2020-01-23 20:40:44,eswxy2,"Agree, absolutely.  I was an anxious/depressed teenager with some issues at home.  Was prescribed Xanax at 14 and by the time I was 16, I had to carry a paper of all the anti-psychotics I was on because it was too many to remember.  All it took was one doctor to ask what the hell was going on, wean me off meds, and I have been unmedicated, happy, and functioning since 17.  

Britney gives me major medicated vibes because, at least in my experience, you function well (for instance, Britney showers, wears makeup, interacts on social media, works out daily) but your personality becomes very empty/husk like.  I could have probably worked a job when I was medicated but family who remembers me back then said I was very off emotionally/mentally."

If you won't use the term with males of the species engaged in the same behavior, then I suggest you don't use it about females of the species engaged in the behavior -- either that or admit that you are slut-shaming and it is a double standard.

1323,2020-01-24 14:58:40,eswxy2,I've been a conservator. It's a big job. For someone like her it was likely beyond a full time job. If he was her guardian the only contract she could get into legally is marriage. Can you imagine doing all her paperwork?  Also making sure they aren't stealing? Conservatorships require a bond and paperwork. It's a fuckton of working including annual reports. He's likely earning that money. Typically family conservators don't get paid but since she's a corporation he's earning that money.
1324,2020-01-24 09:01:09,eswxy2,Did the Judge award that in the conservatorship? Usually when a parent is appointed their child's conservator they can only collect normal fiduciary fees. Since she mostly likely has other people who oversees her money that wouldn't be much.

1358,2020-01-24 01:42:36,eswxy2,"I don't really have *that* much specific knowledge about singing technique, but I know that singing in any way that is unnatural regularly and for extended periods of time can be incredibly damaging. It's why you see the sort of singers like Adele and Sam Smith, who push their vocal chords to insane lengths to belt out those incredible notes, have to get vocal chord surgery, and on the other end of the spectrum, singers who 'scream' (you know, like you hear in metal/hardcore) have specific techniques for doing it as well, otherwise they can totally destroy their voices. Honestly, any singer can do damage to themselves, because the real damage doesn't just come from the type of singing (e.g. belting or screaming), but from doing it wrong when you're doing hundreds of shows every year.

Given how different and unnatural Brit's 'baby' voice sounds to the linked videos of her singing in her more natural, comfortable voice, I have no doubt it probably did some damage."
1359,2020-01-24 04:15:20,eswxy2,"When you make your voice sound unnatural like that, or stretch it to extremes with improper technique you get friction on your vocal chords that can cause calluses to form, just like they would on your hands from using tools. Those calluses make your chords not stretch or line up like they‚Äôre supposed to and voila you have fucked your voice and will need surgery to get them removed."
1360,2020-01-24 03:56:07,eswxy2,"I took voice lessons, years ago. It was best described to me like so: you have two voices- one voice is for singing. Even when you‚Äôre sick if you can use it proper it will sound like a proper singing voice- think old timey styles of singing. I think some call it your upper voice - pretend to be an opera singer to find it. The other is your lower ‚Äútalking voice‚Äù 
If you try to sing exclusively in your lower voice, you‚Äôre going to damage your vocal chords quick. It requires more nasal, you cannot use this voice when sick."

For a year or two, tons of baby blonde bombshells were being pushed. Christina and Britney were the biggest, but there was also Jessica Simpson, Mandy Moore, Willa Ford. Even Jewel tried to do the hotter and sexier thing with ""Intuition"".

I get the impression Christina has a more forceful personality than the rest. She did sex it up for Stripped but she wasn't a teen sex kitten the way Britney was (poor thing). Britney was also in a high profile relationship with Justin Timberlake, which got her a lot of attention and solidified the teeny-bopper obsession with her."
1368,2020-01-24 03:12:30,eswxy2,"I mean, maybe, who knows? From what I‚Äôm
reading, she created a beautiful song with another person. They are both listed as songwriters. If her company (or her) were known to just slap a name on a song with no work behind it, they could‚Äôve done that to a song like Lucky or any other song she sang. 

The truth is, she either didn‚Äôt write a lot of songs. Or she wrote songs that just didn‚Äôt make the album cut (which I think is a more likely scenario.) She was in the industry for years at that point. It wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if she was able to pick up some song writing skills."
1369,2020-01-23 20:58:25,eswxy2,"Edit: It wasn‚Äôt clear but I think you‚Äôre talking about Everytime and not Lucky. She‚Äôs still listed as a songwriter for Everytime, so it‚Äôs semantics."

Similarly the music director for Make Me has suggested that Britney was the one who was insistent on having the image of her dancing in a cage for that video to reflect how she was feeling, although I‚Äôm still not sure why the original video got scrapped in the end"

It kinda is though. Dementia a la Alzheimer‚Äôs at her age is virtually unheard of.. the only really plausible cause would be some kind of TBI, which is possible I suppose. 

It‚Äôs also possible that dementia in this context is something of a ‚Äúterm of art‚Äù in the law governing conservatorship in her jurisdiction. From the Mayo Clinic site:

> Dementia describes a group of symptoms affecting memory, thinking and social abilities severely enough to interfere with your daily life. It isn't a specific disease, but several different diseases may cause dementia.

So if she hits 2 of those 3‚Äì e.g. she‚Äôs experiencing cognitive issues that are bad enough to interfere with her ability to function socially‚Äî that may suffice for establishing that she ‚Äúhas dementia‚Äù for the purposes of granting a conservatorship

It could be that she‚Äôs still affected by the VMA performance as well and all of the ridiculous comments she got then accusing her of being fat.

Lady Gaga replies that she knows Perry is mean and asks if Kesha wants Gaga to talk to Perry for her.

Edit: there's also some pdf court records in which you can read the entire deposition and it's recorded where Gaga states ""don't you roll your eyes at me. You should be ashamed of yourself"" to the producer's lawyer. I thought that was neat, so."
1394,2020-01-24 04:03:11,eswxy2,"I remember that and I think the assistant was just greedy. She was probably hoping for a settlement and didn‚Äôt expect Gaga to actually go to court. The assistant had a dream job as far as personal assistants go (travel the world, food, luxe hotels‚Äîit was all documented in court that these were perks of the job). They agreed to a salary and her schedule was to be on call, and she was paid very handsomely for that. You can‚Äôt sue for overtime if overtime is not part of your salary.

Edit: just read your part about the remote control. I don't recall that being mentioned in court. The most ""petty"" example I remember was having to run to the convenient store to get a toothbrush (that wasn't packed by the assistant in the first place). While this seems petty at first, Gaga explained that she cannot simply go to CVS and grab a toothbrush. She would have to have bodyguards (sometimes a contractual insurance obligation). Now an ordinary day in LA or NY, yeah she could grab her own toothbrush from the store. But not when the paparazzi already knows that she's at the hotel she's staying at and they're already camped out waiting for her exit in the morning. So that's why celebrities have assistants. It's easier for them to just run to CVS than get a whole bunch of people involved. And that's why she was paid a salary and was expected to be on call."

1396,2020-01-24 02:14:25,eswxy2,"Not really.  She has turned out to be kind of a shit person, but she wasn‚Äôt given her biggest hits, she wrote them.  The album that skyrocketed her to fame was Teenage Dream and she co-wrote all five number 1 songs.

It just goes to show you how insidious these publications are and the control they have over people. 

I've always wondered what kind of skeletons Harvey Levin has. I remember a couple years ago [Buzzfeed](https://www.buzzfeed.com/annehelenpetersen/the-down-and-dirty-history-of-tmz) wrote an article about a slew of sexual harassment lawsuits, and Gawker (when they were the only ones calling out Weinstein and Bryan Singer) asked for tips on [Levin](https://gawker.com/tag/harvey-levin_1). All of this went away and Levin now pretty much has an in at the White House and acts like a mouth piece for many celebs."
1403,2020-01-24 07:32:28,eswxy2,"Yep, I did too. Some of the comments he got back then were REALLY funny. People casually reminding him how he was garbage. Of course, it was the old school equivalent of a Disqus thread."

1405,2020-01-24 05:26:11,eswxy2,"Bipolar symptoms come on around early 20s.  Britney started showing symptoms around then, and it‚Äôs possible they were exacerbated by drugs/alcohol as well as Postpartum depression."

1408,2020-01-23 22:19:04,eswxy2,"Oftentimes, a mood stabilizer will be prescribed, then an SSRI in conjunction after the mood stabilizer has become effective at controlling mania and hypomania. SSRIs on their own are a bad idea for bipolar disorder because, without lithium or another mood stabilizer, they can kick manic episodes through the roof. Severe manic episodes can be dangerous for the person suffering through them, and sometimes they cause the sufferer to become dangerous to others as well."
1409,2020-01-23 22:35:51,eswxy2,"As someone who is diagnosed bipolar-1 - I'm on an SNRI, two mood stabilisers, a benzo to help with sleep, and an ADHD medication.   


While an SSRI or SNRI can spike a manic or hypomanic episode, it's usually when you aren't controlling with a mood stabiliser at the same time. When I was on an SSRI and then an SNRI (back when my first diagnosis was depression), I went into an insanely long manic episode with financial impacts that lasted from 2013 to... well, current. It's taken a lot of trial and error to get where I am now, but I do feel mostly stable. Or at least, the most stable I've ever felt in my adult life.  


Proof of being bipolar throughout the last couple years of my account history, if that clarifies anything. r/bipolar does Med Mondays, and I sometimes talk about my doses and whatnot there."

I was misdiagnosed a bipolar as a teenager, and the diagnosis was later redacted because I responded poorly to every type of medication used to treat bipolar disorder. I was actually suffering from severe depression and anxiety in combination with hormonal problems."
1413,2020-01-23 20:26:28,eswxy2,"I believe it's more like the symptoms of bipolar are varied enough that a variety of mental disorders (or even just behaviors) could be ascribed to ""bipolar"" by a doctor just looking to get a diagnosis out there and not look further into other issues. Like how every time I go to the doctor with a problem they start with ""are you sure you're not just pregnant"" except you can't pee on a stick to demonstrate they need to look deeper into a mental disorder."

1432,2020-01-24 00:37:58,eswxy2,I stand corrected. Thanks for the accurate information.
1433,2020-01-24 01:14:37,eswxy2,"Well, not to sound harsh, but you sound a bit uninformed. Britney was performing as recently as 2017 & 2018, and she was supposed to have a Las Vegas residency in 2019. In fact, the cancelation of that Las Vegas residency is part of what sparked the public‚Äôs curiosity in whether or not Jamie was acting appropriately as Britney‚Äôs conservator. Britney (my guess is, in reality, it‚Äôs Britney‚Äôs team) claims that the tour was canceled so that she could spend time with her ill father.

So explain to me, then, why weeks later, Britney‚Äôs father is out gallivanting at events while Britney is locked away in an institution with no contact to the outside world.

Britney‚Äôs own mother has confirmed that she was slipped drugs on and off for years, by her own team. When she went to talk a director on her own video shoot, a bodyguard interrupted them to make sure the conversation was appropriate. They chose her clothes, her makeup. When she didn‚Äôt want to perform, her team would ask her friends to convince Britney, bribing them with shopping sprees. She can‚Äôt even date or get married without approval. And yeah, if you‚Äôre an alcoholic, you absolutely should not be in charge of another human being‚Äôs autonomy and funds. Just my opinion. 

Conservatorship abuse is nothing new. I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre going so hard to defend her father."
1434,2020-01-24 07:10:12,eswxy2,"FWIW, Yes, her father is an alcoholic but has been in recovery and sober for well over a decade (since before Britney‚Äôs ‚Äúbreakdown‚Äù in 2007)."
1435,2020-01-24 01:43:46,eswxy2,Do you believe everything at face value?
1436,2020-01-23 20:46:23,eswxy2,"I get the same sense of dissonance, but I think it has more to do with Britney being very isolated and seeking validation from her fans, than it does with any conscious outside handling."
1437,2020-01-24 02:34:56,eswxy2,"I agree that they are very weird but to me it‚Äôs almost like she is a child. From her outfits to the things she says / posts. 

Also, can someone please explain the relationship with her boyfriend?? That is so bizarre to me also, unless he‚Äôs also after her money."
1438,2020-01-24 17:12:12,eswxy2,"I don‚Äôt know, I get the feeling that they are happy for Britney to embarrass herself, because that then justifies in many people‚Äôs eyes that she is unstable and really not capable of looking after herself. Surely the last thing they would want is for Britney to come across as competent, because then you‚Äôd get even more people speaking up for her and wondering why a grown woman is under such strict control that she‚Äôs not even allowed to drive or own an iPhone"
1439,2020-01-24 13:43:05,eswxy2,Oh but she has
1440,2020-01-23 20:49:44,eswxy2,"Thank you for sharing your story! I‚Äôm glad to hear that you made it through to the other side and are happy and well!

I maintained my job while being over-medicated and while I did make it through, everyone knew something was wrong and was very concerned about me. I get those vibes from Britney, too."
1441,2020-01-24 01:20:17,eswxy2,Taking an antipsychotic while not psychotic is very different from taking one while psychotic.  The person I got the pill from was very high functioning while on antipsychotics.
1442,2020-01-23 20:10:00,eswxy2,"Psychiatry is not an exact science at all so it doesn‚Äôt matter how good a doctor is, sometimes they just 1. Can‚Äôt find the right combo of meds yet (it took me over 10 years to find the right combo, most of the meds I took caused me to feel even worse whether physically or mentally) or 2. Meds don‚Äôt work all together for some people unfortunately. Sometimes your brain just doesn‚Äôt work right and you can‚Äôt fix it

Especially when considering she more than likely has (complex) PTSD which is best treated with therapy and cannot improve if she continues to be around an abuser. You can‚Äôt heal from trauma when you continue to be traumatized. You can have all the money in the world and try any medication you want but it still won‚Äôt fix anything if you cannot change the situation that made you the way you are."
1443,2020-01-23 20:12:37,eswxy2,Did MJ have the best doctor? Nope... his doctor was paid a premium and he still killed him. Paying a premium for a doctor does not mean that it‚Äôs a good doctor.

1450,2020-01-24 03:02:57,eswxy2,"I think the person is referring to how Britney was heavily marketed while she was underage, as a sexualized school girl. There was also a huge obsession with her virginity."
1451,2020-01-23 20:18:01,eswxy2,"I mean given everything I just posted that seems pretty fair and in her best interest. She fucked up really bad when she had free reign of all of those and almost lost everything in her life, including her life. She's doing better but still likely does not have the mental capacity or maturity to make good, healthy decisions for herself.

She does get to have a boyfriend, she does get to go travel with him, go on dates, etc. So it's not like she is locked in the house and only let out to work. It just has to be verified she isn't going to run off and go meth again or meet up with someone random and buy them a new Ferrari."
1452,2020-01-23 21:05:31,eswxy2,"I absolutely never said she was kinda weird but mostly normal or kinda stressed.

I've been stressing to everyone just how bad off mentally Britney is. This conservatorship has been for her own good and I think the people who want her to be free are the ones who do not have her best interests are heart.

Like I think she has gotten much better, but I think she still needs assistance for sure."
1453,2020-01-24 11:35:14,eswxy2,"I fully agree with you, I think my attitude was about the comment you were replying to and you received it as reply to your comment instead. Sorry about that. You're absolutely right."
1454,2020-01-24 00:47:25,eswxy2,"***Promiscuous:***  *demonstrating or implying an undiscriminating or unselective approach; indiscriminate or casual.* 

I did not call her a slut, I used a word that neatly wrapped up exactly what she did at the time. I actually work in the adult industry so you don't have to lecture me about casual or consensual sex, you would have to be pretty open minded to do what I do. However, I will never agree that anything Britney did at that point in her life was healthy for her, including promiscuous sex. You can accuse me of being sexist or whatever all you want, but I'm sticking with it.

Afterall, it is hard to consent when you're doped up and mentally in a wrong state of mind. And yes, I would be concerned about anyone I care about who was going through something like this be it male or female ... and right now we are on the topic of a female."

1456,2020-01-23 21:03:23,eswxy2,I think she was caught with a Valtrax prescription and it was rumored she had something else like maybe HPV or gonorrhea.
1457,2020-01-24 00:17:37,eswxy2,"Did you not read my reply or are you just looking for a reason to be a keyboard feminist? Because you're turning this into something off topic and unnecessary.

I honestly don't care what Kevin has done because I don't care about him. I'm here to talk about Britney. Britney was promiscuous when she was mentally unwell and also a drug addict which is a bad combo. She was not fit to make wise decisions which lead to her sleeping with bad dudes,contracting STDs and she risked pregnancy with men who were using her and who were bad people, I shouldn't have to repeat that and you should understand why that was a bad thing. That's totally not the situation to be all YOU GO GIRL!! over.

If she were well and safe it would not be concerning."

1463,2020-01-23 20:00:18,eswxy2,"In her case? Not sure, but in the case of my cousin who‚Äôs ex alleged she was a frequent drug abuser she had to submit several drug tests to prove she was not a drug user. This included hair and blood samples."
1464,2020-01-23 19:55:13,eswxy2,"I think the point, in a custody battle, is to prove she had been using using drugs for X amount of time whereas a blood or itinerary sample would be fine given enough time in court to produce it. If she knew that was on the horizon she could stop doing drugs for a bit and pass a UA or blood test."
1465,2020-01-23 19:28:27,eswxy2,"Well, I mean Britney wasn't in her right mind at the time. She wasn't thinking anything through.But that's the reason why should we be drug tested at that time."
1466,2020-01-23 19:58:50,eswxy2,"I was joking pal. The joke being the feigned misconception that Charlie Sheen shaved Britney Spears' head to help his own custody hearing, which is ludicrous, when it was clear you meant he shaved his own head."
1467,2020-01-24 01:38:47,eswxy2,She isn't working. Her long-time manager said last May that the Vegas residency is cancelled and that he didn't believe she would ever perform again.
1468,2020-01-24 04:08:52,eswxy2,"Well the first thing that the conservators did after Britney had a breakdown was...send her on a world tour.  For year after year after year.  The Vegas residency only started recently, partly because now there's a better margin on it (world tours are *expensive*, and a bigger gamble than having a residency where a casino will pay you a guaranteed sum per year)."
1469,2020-01-23 19:19:44,eswxy2,"What the absolute fuck?If she needs that level of care, that's what she needs. I respect people with mental illness, and respect that what she may or may not be dealing with is no one's business. It's for her doctors and courts to decide. Your opinion, and mine, don't mean shit. You don't know what her treatment plan is. 

Her case is complicated by having minor children."
1470,2020-01-23 21:04:05,eswxy2,I agree with you that nefarious mind control exists. I don't doubt that at all. I just think that the people responsible are determined to cover it up. Knowing that the CIA invented the term 'conspiracy theory' to discredit people who don't believe what they are told I would not doubt that they would invent the Project Monarch stories to make rich and famous people sexually abusing children seem like such a crazy idea no one could believe it and would dismiss anyone making similar claims.
1471,2020-01-23 22:34:39,eswxy2,"I always heard rumours she was bipolar and not on medications, and/or addicted to methamphetamine.  Both would get someone put into a mental hospital if they were a danger to themselves or others, and could result in conservatorship of their finances as well.

1481,2020-01-24 12:58:47,eswxy2,I never said she and her mom were never close. I said she is more close to her Dad than her Mom considering she had absolutely no relationship with her mom for most of her 20s and 30s.

1526,2020-01-24 03:42:46,eswxy2,"Re: Extreme metal singers--check out Melissa Rossi's *The Zen of Screaming*.  She was trained as a classical vocalist IIRC, but ended up working with extreme metal singers, teaching them how to warm up and giving them other techniques that would let them howl onstage every night without destroying their throats.  Methinks someone should send her Adele's way before the latter ends up losing her voice to a surgeon *a la* Julia Andrews.

A particular funny story Melissa told once to a magazine was how she referred to her hardcore clients as ""The Guys from Planet Nice Guy""--they'd come into her studio covered in ink and piercings and looking as if they were about to invade Iceland with the other Vikings or some such, which scared the hell out of her at first, but pretty much to a man they were polite, soft-spoken, and well-mannered.  (A friend of mine hangs with Norwegian Black Metal musicians and fans, and apparently the same holds true there; Varg‚Äô Vikernes killed Mayhem guitarist Euronymous, who earlier had taken pictures of his bandmate Dead after the latter blew his brains out; fortunately Varg, who got out of prison a few years ago, was an outlier.)"

The schoolgirl music video (kinda weird in retrospect) was crazy. Everybody either had a Britney poser on their wall and everybody hated on N'Sync and Backstreet Boys for being 'gay'. I feel like pop stars were on a different level back then since there were fewer outlets. You basically had MTV, magazines, and radio. Versus today where things are a bit more stratified with social media."

Plus, on the song being talked about, the woman who co-wrote it did [an interview](https://muumuse.com/2010/02/annet-artani-from-everytime-to-alive.html/) where she said they wrote it together in Britney's house. Please don't talk about things you don't know about, thank you üíô"

*edit - I'm confused by all these silent downvotes.

1546,2020-01-24 03:23:28,eswxy2,"I'm sorry, I may not have been clear. The reason someone who is under conservatorship or a ward of someone else may not be allowed to vote is because their caretaker has undue influence over them, and effectively can get them to vote however. 

It's not that they literally get an extra vote. It's that the likelihood is high that if someone has been deemed incapable of buying their own clothes and cooking their own meals, they're also incapable of deciding how to vote, and thus if they do vote, who told them who to choose?

This makes some sense for truly bad cases. But unfortunately, regressives also trot this out to try to limit mail in ballot accessibility. It's a fine line, and there are a lot of bad faith actors out there trying to muddy the waters, which is why abusing a conservatorship is so atrocious."

1552,2020-01-24 05:15:14,eswxy2,"> She was probably hoping for a settlement and didn‚Äôt expect Gaga to actually go to court.

The assistant got a settlement in the end.  Gaga testified and came across as a real asshole, which was bad for her brand.  Also, you can't legally expect 24/7 availability from an assistant so Gaga was always going to lose.

>The assistant had a dream job as far as personal assistants go (travel the world, food, luxe hotels‚Äîit was all documented in court that these were perks of the job).

But you're not getting to see the world on these trips.  You're spending your time in transit and backstage.  

>she was paid very handsomely for that

$75k for constant availability is not a lot of money.

It went so far beyond running out from a toothbrush, which FYI you can pretty much always get from the hotel staff.

1. [According to court papers, Lady Gaga, listed in the litigation under her birth name - Stefani Germanotta - and O'Neill frequently slept in the same bed because O'Neill never had her own hotel room while on tour and was required to address Lady Gaga's needs throughout the night.](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2471309/Lady-Gaga-settles-lawsuit-filed-ex-personal-assistant.html)

2. [The court case provided a hint of some of the things O‚ÄôNeill might spill about her former boss, including being required to share a bed with Gaga because she didn‚Äôt like sleeping alone and being woken in the middle of the night to change the DVD in the player because Gaga didn‚Äôt feel like doing it herself.](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/lady-gagas-assistant-writing-tell-719402)

3. [Another former personal assistant, Angela Ciemny, was required to sleep with Gaga most nights because the needy diva refused to be alone, according to the book ‚ÄúPoker Face: The Rise and Rise of Lady Gaga.‚Äù](https://nypost.com/2011/12/25/i-was-gagas-slave/)

In her batshit crazy testimony, Gaga referred to herself as ""Queen of the Universe"" and complained that her former assistant didn't want to be a ""slave."""

I was just curious, because I dimly recall (it was many years ago now) going on a mood stabiliser, and I think my SSRI got stopped or transitioned onto an older one.

1571,2020-01-24 05:44:37,eswxy2,"Yeah I remember that. I also remember she broke up K-Fed's relationship with Shar Jackson, so she was making some pretty reckless decisions herself. 

I think Wendy Williams recently when talking about Nicki Minaj's relationship to her murderer husband made an interesting point about female stars who get into relationships with men from their childhood, and how it's because they knew them before they became famous. So I imagine the 2 day marriage in Vegas was because of that."
1572,2020-01-24 16:41:23,eswxy2,There were two handguns in the house. It was one of the reasons Kevin panicked.

Before calling the police, he went to a shop and bought a disposable camera with which he photographed the body, after rearranging some items.[7][8][9] One of these photographs was later used as the cover of a bootleg live album...""

Then 2 years later, the guy who took the suicide photos of his friend ends up getting stabbed to death by his other bandmate. 

So much to unpack here. But do you think it's possible maybe Euronymous killed Dead & set it up to look like a suicide? It was Euronymous' gun, afterall.. and he clearly was a disturbed individual, constantly threatening to kill people & burning churches down & literally worshipping satan.

Also the article said he saved brain matter & skull fragments & bullets from the crime scene, which he crafted into jewelry for his black metal friends, & used as soup flavoring.

It's *very* weird in retrospect that a major corporate business promoted a 17 year old singer as a schoolgirl sex object in a music video and that the principal cultural response was ""wow, she's pretty good"" and not ""hey, that's kind of weird"".  

It would have been one thing if Spears had done the same dance moves and skimpy clothes in a setting other than a school full of minors (basically sexualized as someone older than she really was).

1686,2020-01-24 05:45:01,eswxy2,"Looks like it was settled out of court, which is a shame because it seems the assistant was greedy and got what she wanted in the end. A high-profile case, even if unfair in merit, can cause bad publicity for a celebrity. Sometimes you have to cough up the money even when it doesn't seem just in order to protect your reputation.

Yes, the assistant claimed sharing beds, changing DVDs, etc. but she is trying to win money in court and that certainly does not mean these claims are factual.

The other claim from personal assistant Angela Ciemny is from a tell-all book. Tell-all books are notorious for saying whatever needs to be said to sell the book.

Your representation of Gaga referring to herself as ""queen of the universe"" is misleading. Gaga actually stated it was the assistant who believed the assistant herself was queen of the universe, and the assistant didn't want to be a slave to another queen of the universe (Gaga). So Gaga is saying that the assistant's entitlement kept her from adequately addressing her needs. Yeah Gaga also calling herself queen of the universe is a little abrasive, but all the people around her are working for her. She pays their salaries and she is the boss. 

Gaga has been in the business for 12 years now and had one money-hungry assistant. I'd bet she must be decent to work for. She's been around long enough to have a diva reputation (Mariah Carey, Ariana Grande) if she truly were one."

1696,2020-01-24 01:42:26,eswxy2,"Well, say what you mean, then. You said she hadn‚Äôt performed in several years, so I corrected you. A year is not a long time to not be touring for a pop star. For example, Ariana Grande has only toured every other year since her career began. When she took time off between albums, was she ‚Äúout of work‚Äù? That‚Äôs normal in the industry...

All of your points center around saying, ‚Äúyes, that‚Äôs what happens in a conservatorship.‚Äù I understand that she is in one. Everyone in this thread gets that.

My point is that Britney Spears should not be in a conservatorship at all, where she is subject to abuse by her handlers. Maybe you can turn a blind eye because you think a little public meltdown justifies being controlled for her entire life, but I, along with a lot of other people, don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs not even much of an opinion at this point ‚Äî I‚Äôve presented so much evidence to you, as has the OP. There is literally an ongoing court case to investigate the matter. Britney‚Äôs sons even have a restraining order against her father, but nah, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs just ‚Äúmy opinion.‚Äù You seem solid on your stance. I‚Äôm not engaging further because it‚Äôd be a waste of both of our time."
1697,2020-01-24 02:36:39,eswxy2,Exactly. Britney had to have court ordered supervised visitation with her children because she wasn‚Äôt fit to be alone with them. People can google Britney/ambulance if they need a refresher of how off the rails she was.
1698,2020-01-23 20:25:34,eswxy2,"Her boyfriend is a model, she met him on the set of Slumber Party. You are thinking of her last 3 boyfriends.

She really loves this guy. You can tell when Britney loves someone. Like I said, who knows how he really feels about her, though. He's a 24 year old nobody and she's former rich, American Princess regardless of her issues.

She said she instantly thought he was hot, asked him for his number (and after getting permission and probably a background check) called him a few weeks later and flew him out for dinner."

1700,2020-01-24 13:15:49,eswxy2,"Britney was freely giving her money away to people, spending it on BS and nearly became broke. A common sign of bipolar is to spend frivolously. If anyone cares about preserving all that she has worked hard for her entire life it makes sense to give her an allowance not to blow it.

Britney does not know how to choose friends or romantic partners who are healthy for her. As seen by the past she has repeatedly chosen leeches, addicts, alcoholics, people who just see her as a cash cow, or who want to propel off her fame. And she trusts these people with all of her heart, she is desperate. She has lived in a bubble all of her life, I don't think she's really ever had many true friends before and probably has no real way of meeting any. It makes sense to protect her and monitor who she is associating with to ensure their intentions are not harmful to her.

She has to have someone monitor her that she is doing ok, taking her meds daily, reminding her to take a bath, ensuring she is not doing drugs, etc

She does not know how to function as an adult the same way a normal 40 year old does and does not have a proper sense of reality, on top of that she has mental illness .. bipolar in particular can make a person extremely reckless and easily damage ones life. So you can't really judge her as a typical woman who has a little depression. Her situation is way more complicated than that."

Her wild days and break down happened when the internet really started to take off and become accessible to everyone, as did celeb culture. The paparazzi followed her ever single move from around the time she met Kevin and posted it all online. She was more than willing to show out for them, and I was happy to eat it up. You could check back like 5x a day on any celebrity gossip blog (my favorite was Fametracker) and there'd be like several new sets of pics of her doing something. It was all so scandalous at the time because we had never seen a celebrity so candid before, just letting it all hang out and showing their most trashy side and giving no foks ... certainly not the perfect pop princess Miss Spears. Man, I still remember her giving Kevin him a BJ on a balcony in front of everyone knowing good and well the paps were recording lmao. She was wild.

1796,2020-01-24 17:28:56,eswxy2,"And plenty of male celebs have been known for their reckless spending, I can think of Michael Jackson and Johnny Depp offhand almost bankrupting themselves, and yet I don‚Äôt remember them being given an allowance because they can‚Äôt be trusted with spending their own money

A lot of other celebs too have made horrible choices with who they surround themselves with, a lot of celebs have acted out and been a total mess in their 20‚Äôs, so again it stands out that it‚Äôs only Britney for some reason who was put under such a strict conservatorship for apparently life because she can‚Äôt be trusted to make good decisions. Arguably it‚Äôs going from one extreme to the other to instead pick out and pay men to date her (her former fianc√©e Jason for one) and for her father to micro manage her entire life, how is she ever supposed to do better if she‚Äôs not being given the tools to make her own decisions?


And editing to add my response to your original comment here as for some reason this post has been locked for comments now

She was not ‚Äòflashing her vagina‚Äô, she wasn‚Äôt wearing panties and the paparazzi got an up-skirt shot as she was getting out a car. Unwise not to be wearing underwear certainly, but it‚Äôs disingenuous to paint it as if she was flashing herself for attention and that she wanted those photographs out there. A lot of what you describe was her drinking way too much and rebelling after the separation from Kevin, clearly she didn‚Äôt handle that time in her life well, but nothing about it ever suggested to me that she was severely mentally impaired and needed to be put under a conservatorship for life. What she needed was rehab and some time away from the spotlight (and away from Sam Lufti of course who was allegedly drugging and gaslighting her at that time according to her mother), instead she was put back to work on a Circus album and tour almost as soon as her father got control of Britney signed over to him

A lot of other things have been overstated too, she didn‚Äôt put her children in danger and almost drop them multiple times, she slipped on a wet spot on the sidewalk and her bodyguard grabbed her son as she lost her grip on him, it was hardly a case of her deliberately dangling him out of an open window or something of that nature. And while it was a foolish decision to drive with her child in her lap, she was a new mother and she was doing what she was brought up with, all of these incidents were just scrutinised so much more and became almost infamous because she was Britney Spears. She even did an interview talking about how the pressure she was under was making it so much harder for her when she was trying to be a good mom, and the tabloids were treating her as barely human. 

I can‚Äôt see that she is doing better now in any way when you look at how dead behind the eyes and robotic she comes across as, I‚Äôve seen way more concern for her mental health expressed by your average person since she was placed under the lifelong conservatorship than I ever did when she was partying and drinking too much with Paris Hilton. The photos released last year after her stay in the mental hospital were horrifying"
1797,2020-01-24 15:47:36,eswxy2,"I'm bipolar so I know a little about it. Conservatorship for bipolar is extremely rare, she certainly needs assistance and care, she doesn't need the amount of control taken away that the conservatorship does. She also doesn't need that control to be in the hands of her previous abuser.
What she needs is advocacy."

Years later, a coworker had him playing in her office as background noise and (for context) I had left an abusive relationship not two years prior. The shit he was saying to a victim of abuse was literally everything you shouldn't say. (I remember one point specifically was taking ownership of their contribution to the abuse (!!!) and something to the effect of putting more effort into the relationship when the person needed nothing more than to GTFO.)

So many people watch his stupid show and I was horrified to think that there were going to be people staying in a relationship because they believed him and really thought trying harder would fix things (spoiler alert: the better you do, the faster they move the goal posts and their behaviour and poor treatment is not your fault or responsibility to stay and fix them).

It is sort of similar here but I know that it's more common to get rounds and that pub culture is super important in the UK. In the US, social drinking tends to manifest more in a peer pressure setting, where it's more about rebellion and getting in trouble as a ""group"". People think I'm odd but I'll sometimes ask for water or something sweet. Sometimes I absolutely hate the ambience of bars and prefer family friendly social scenes. It is interesting how the world in general does not want to have a conversation about how common addictions are.

1886,2020-01-23 21:06:36,eswxy2,"I‚Äôm not really sure what your point is, outside of purposefully being contrarian. I don‚Äôt know how being severely mentally ill would constitute drug testing through hair, but I suppose you‚Äôll find any possibility to argue my points.

Ultimately the point is this; none of us will know the truth about any of her actions because she is a high profile celebrity. We can all speculate why she did what she did, and whether it‚Äôs correct or not it doesn‚Äôt really matter. This is a post speculating her actions within her realm of conspiracy. You seem to be very bothered by the possibility that she shaved her head to avoid drug testing, and I‚Äôm sorry that my opinion (coupled by many many other opinions made by others) has triggered you in some way. 

Please seek peace in accepting the unknown."
1887,2020-01-24 16:53:51,eswxy2,"I read the updates Wednesday at work and started crying at my desk. The 3 year old trying to fight the mom off his sister...I have a 4 year old and all I wanted to do was go home and snuggle him. It‚Äôs been a long time since the news has affected me so much, truly heart breaking. In a case like this she shouldn‚Äôt get the death penalty, I feel like she needs to spend the rest of her long miserable life in prison thinking about what she did."
1888,2020-01-24 06:35:57,eswxy2,AMA please.
1889,2020-01-24 01:26:55,eswxy2,"No no! I think you were being very kind to him, which is good too. The world needs more kindness."
1890,2020-01-24 03:40:19,eswxy2,"I never really thought she was a great actor (and to be blunt I still don't), but goddamn she's hilarious in Santa Clarita Diet. I don't know if that character was written to explicitly play to the strengths she has or if it was just a fantastic coincidence, but I'm glad it happened either way."
1891,2020-01-24 06:25:04,eswxy2,I am very sad Netflix cancelled it. I loved it. Damn Netflix's rule of three.
1892,2020-01-24 08:43:19,eswxy2,So pissed they ended it and on a cliff hanger at that!!
1893,2020-01-24 13:29:37,eswxy2,Steve O and a few of the other Jackass guys come to mind
1894,2020-01-24 03:48:25,eswxy2,"Rob Lowe had an impressive turnaround, too, even though he didn't start acting until his teen years."
1895,2020-01-24 16:39:28,eswxy2,"Drew Barrymore's career hit a post-rehab slowdown in the late 80s/early 90s, when she did several made-for-TV and indie movies. She's written about working in a coffee shop around that time, since she was an emancipated teenager who wanted the normalcy and routine of a part-time job. However, Drew wasn't plucked out of obscurity to appear in *Charlie's Angels*. Beginning with *Scream*, in 1996, she had a run of hits: *The Wedding Singer*, *Ever After*, and *Never Been Kissed*. Drew bought the rights *Charlie's Angels* through her production company, Flower Films, and the movie wouldn't have been made without her involvement."
1896,2020-01-24 14:37:27,eswxy2,"You probably are annoyed by her Valley girl accent, its worse in her old interviews and she sometimes loses it with certain roles she plays. She grew up in the San Fernando Valley."
1897,2020-01-24 09:34:56,eswxy2,"He said a while ago that he has so much money from his child actor days, that he doesn't HAVE to act anymore, so he only does it if he really wants to."
1898,2020-01-24 16:04:12,eswxy2,"One of the sadder parts of the whole child actor thing is that I think a lot of them who genuinely do enjoy acting burn out or are psychologically destroyed by, like, age 12. So they never get to pursue this artform that might have genuinely made them happy."
1899,2020-01-24 17:16:58,eswxy2,"I have a few friends who disowned their families for one reason or another. Like I said, as normal as any of us are."
1900,2020-01-24 13:19:03,eswxy2,"If you're assuming that he had a bad drug addiction from paparazzi or celeb media then I'd have to disagree. The only legal trouble he had was being found with weed, xanax and klonopin. He was on an interview pod I listen to and he was asked about his drug days and he said he never did hard drugs although everyone assumed he did, he did say he sometimes drank to excess. I clearly don't know what's true or not but it seems like that's an assumption the public made about him because of how he looked/dressed."
1901,2020-01-24 07:50:00,eswxy2,"You know what the only difference is between Macaulay Culkin and a bunch of my friends in the 90's and 2000's? He'd do something or look a certain way, and it ended up in a celebrity news rag. My friends only had to hide it from their families. It was the 90's; we all had problems. Some of us still have those problems, some don't, and some are dead. Like I said, Culkin is as normal as the rest of us."
1902,2020-01-24 13:41:34,eswxy2,He was on Joe Rogan Podcast if you're interested in what's he's doing nowadays
1903,2020-01-24 15:47:01,eswxy2,"He was treated terribly by Trek fans when he was a kid.  Most redditors are too young to remember, but back in the day alt.wesley.crusher.die.die.die was a famously  active Usenet group, people loved to hate on Wil."
1904,2020-01-24 17:24:42,eswxy2,Point to the part of the doll where Wil Wheaton hurt you.
1905,2020-01-24 05:59:52,eswxy2,How so?
1906,2020-01-24 12:42:38,eswxy2,"What's the ""Fanta fanta no coke"" thing? I looked it up but I don't understand the context. It was just something she said at a drive through and it got turned into a song or something?"
1907,2020-01-24 06:07:58,eswxy2,"I saw that. I don‚Äôt keep up with gossip; the Howard Stern interview was the first time I‚Äôd heard about her in ages. I suppose she could be doing that, but I‚Äôve never heard that before seeing the others‚Äô comments. Her emphasis on loving life in Dubai because of the absence of paparazzi would certainly help her hide being an escort. IIRC she was living in a very large apartment building and she was one of only a few residents, and she valued the solitude."
1908,2020-01-24 13:45:18,eswxy2,Yeah that's a wild allegation to report as fact.
1909,2020-01-24 03:49:52,eswxy2,"So again, what is the source on any of this?

So while I 100% agree there is probably something going on with Dan Schneider, there still isn't any evidence that he's her child's father. Just that he's a creep who has a lot of allegations against him, but none from the actual actors that have worked with him. And while I get it, he has power, until the actors themselves speak out it's probably not worth theorizing about.

Literally neither source has a single quote from a single cast or crew member. It's just fans making up theories. Quoting someone making a blog post who wasn't involved isn't exactly proof of anything."
1910,2020-01-24 03:46:13,eswxy2,Fuck I didn‚Äôt know all this
1911,2020-01-24 06:01:39,eswxy2,Those were all teens... Not even knowing what pedophile means really doesn't help your credibility.
1912,2020-01-24 16:12:34,eswxy2,"I've never seen her live before. I wish I could have when she was in her peak. ""Oops..."" or ""In the Zone"" eras."
1913,2020-01-24 07:48:24,eswxy2,(Off-topic but I love your name.)
1914,2020-01-24 01:05:17,eswxy2,yeah and her story is she had sex with her boyfriend and got pregnant. And as others have pointed out the kid looks like the guy she says is the father
1915,2020-01-24 03:32:15,eswxy2,Schindler?
1916,2020-01-24 01:07:14,eswxy2,"well thats the dumbest piece of ""evidence"" i've ever hear. 

Actress posts video in zombie makeup and says ""Look what you've done to me"" apparently = Producer for Nick is a pedophile"
1917,2020-01-24 03:26:09,eswxy2,"Wow, 2012! I guess I really did do a good job getting off the gossip sites, I totally missed that story."
1918,2020-01-23 23:25:49,eswxy2,Right. The website lied a lot and the whole RDJ being hmmm was a fake story that got outta hand.
1919,2020-01-24 00:38:39,eswxy2,"Dan ""the hymen divider"" Schneider?"
1920,2020-01-23 22:17:18,eswxy2,Being a good straight man is way harder than it looks.

1924,2020-01-24 00:16:38,eswxy2,This whole thread is a trip back in time!
1925,2020-01-23 21:07:06,eswxy2,There‚Äôs a double standard for women.
1926,2020-01-24 03:18:52,eswxy2,I‚Äôve never understood how that was a scandal in the first place.
1927,2020-01-23 21:59:13,eswxy2,"The silvery thing was actually her nipple and the piercing/jewelry. It wasn't scripted, it was a prop maneuver to go with the words of the song.  Her nipple and jewelry was not supposed to be shown. A pink piece of fabric was supposed to be left once the covering was removed. He pulled too hard and actually showed her nipple jewelry. Her areola was covered but that silver thing was the piercing going through her nipple. The end result was not a publicity stunt nor was it meant to be."
1928,2020-01-24 02:09:50,eswxy2,Yep. She seems to be doing pretty well for herself!

1932,2020-01-24 10:56:59,eswxy2,"Dude. If you havent seen his Joe Rogan podcast interview on YT, plz drop everything & go watch it. Then come back and explain to me what kind of anti-aging routines (rituals?) these celebrities are into. Because that man appears to be a walking, talking, shrieking, advertisement for the Dark Arts.

How can he look like that at his age? How can he claim to be sober? Did he actually pass out in the middle of the Rogan interview, snooze for a few seconds, and then jolt back to life like nothing happened? What kind of drugs do that? He has quite a few senior moments in the podcast.. its fascinating to watch an old man ranting all over the place & losing his train of thought, while wearing such a convincing meat suit of a younger human. How does Hollywood do that?

Talk about unresolved mysteries.."

Also, I love 50 First Dates"
1940,2020-01-24 05:33:37,eswxy2,Some of her acting is so bad! But she's one of those actors that are just hard not to like. She was definitely great in SCD though like you said.
1941,2020-01-24 11:56:19,eswxy2,I don't think a great actresses but she's charming af. I always love to see her in things.
1942,2020-01-24 14:09:08,eswxy2,I will always remember her first as the girl from the 80's remake of Babes in Toyland.
1943,2020-01-24 15:31:40,eswxy2,Right?!  I NEED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO MR. BALL LEGS!!!
1944,2020-01-24 17:02:11,eswxy2,I literally haven‚Äôt watched the last few episodes because I just don‚Äôt want it to end!!!
1945,2020-01-24 03:56:37,eswxy2,"True, I completely forgot Rob Lowe‚Äôs sex tape with an underage girl days. Although there have been some sexual harassment allegations as recently as 2008. I wonder if his improved public image is about real change as much as the general public‚Äôs willingness to forgive sexual transgressions by men as long as they haven‚Äôt been discussed much since 2016."
1946,2020-01-24 14:40:24,eswxy2,"Yeah that, and I dunno ‚Äî it‚Äôs tough to put my finger on ‚Äî but there‚Äôs just something about her.  Pretty much everything before TMS that she was in, I found her unbearable."

1948,2020-01-24 17:20:38,eswxy2,"Shut up, Wesley. 

I was barely in elementary school when TNG premiered (classic TNG Borg still scare the shit out of me, though VOY helped squash that some by neutering them). But even as a kid I remember articles that bashed on Wheaton and stuff in magazines at the checkout counter. Made no sense to me then, still doesn't now."
1949,2020-01-24 06:09:56,eswxy2,Maybe it's about the time Wheaton bailed on the 1995 Dixie Trek convention.

It was like she forgot what she had enjoyed drinking it, and it became a meme of sorts on Britney boards and ONTD. I also remember she had these lollipops that were reported as some phentermine like drug."
1951,2020-01-24 03:56:59,eswxy2,I doubt it's true. I'm sure Dan has done some awful things but James child looks exactly like the father.
1952,2020-01-24 03:56:47,eswxy2,"Yeah that's the thing. A lot of it is tons of rumors and I think speculation based on Dan Schneider's shows, (lots of close up shots of actresses feet, actresses eating food involving their feet, general weirdness like that). I think years ago on reddit someone said that they were invited to Dan Schneider's trailer and that he wanted to suck on their toes, but it's reddit, anyone can say anything....So again, no one knows for sure."

1962,2020-01-24 03:22:04,eswxy2,"Not to mention that it's gone totally batshit right-wing nutjob over the past, oh, 3-5 years; it's pretty much devoted these days to claiming that EVERYONE in show business is a pedophile or some kind of sleazebag.  Supposedly David Geffen is one of the big shots behind a huge pedophile ring extending into the highest reaches of business, government, etc., which is why nothing is ever done about any of it.  (While I don't doubt there are indeed pedos in the business, the whole idea of a Vast Conspiracy of them strikes me as a bit off; wouldn't it be more likely that individuals or small groups would get together, rather than some vast ""organization""?)  If you're not an outright pedo, you're some kind of sexually rapacious sleaze; if you're a woman, you're either a hypocrite re: Me Too, a ""yachter/yacht girl"" (read: basically a prostitute servicing extremely rich men, usually Saudis or some other Middle Eastern nationality who like abusing women--I'm hoping I don't have to explain ""porta-potty"" to you all...).  It comes off now as total fantasy wish-fulfillment guaranteed to make people whose lives otherwise suck feel superior to those they assume look down on them.  Again, I'm sure there are plenty of sick fucks ""in the biz,"" and plenty of people who just plain like to screw around, but there are lots of other working people, including actors and actresses, who live fairly ordinary lives when they're not actually working or doing the press/awards season circuit (which is really just another kind of work).  It's too bad because the site was fun when it first started--Full Frontal Friday, in which nudes of various famous men were featured, was a particular highlight. (Let's just say that anyone who thinks smoking weed potentially shrinks one's junk clearly hasn't seen nudes of Snoop Dogg; that man is definitely packing considerable heat.)"
1963,2020-01-24 03:09:33,eswxy2,"As per any gossip site, it works on the basis that if you put out enough speculative stories without naming anyone, sooner or later one story will seem to be true. I recall that site claiming ‚Äúa big win‚Äù for guessing Jennifer Lopez was going to get divorced off the back of an article that said ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a singer/actress who is hard to live with whose relationship is coming to an end‚Äù If it had been a different week, I‚Äôm sure they would have insisted they were talking about Madonna/Beyonc√©/whoever happened to have announced a split"

Also, 3 producers quit because Kirk said they were peddling porn with scripts. His costar's got sick if him proselytizing too. Kirk was an atheist for some time and then found god again around 89. The guy who played his friend Boner and Alan Thicke were both Atheist. I read that he did later apologize to the cast for his behavior. Originally the show focused kinda heavily on Kirk and they had to back that off. So I guess he knew the power he had in making demands."

Watching an interview with him was the thing that made me realize I had a drinking problem myself. He told the interviewer he hadn't had a drink in 15 years and that he never would again. The interviewer said, ""That just seems terribly sad. So not even a single glass of wine with dinner?"" Rob Lowe said, ""Why would you ever have a single glass of wine?"" I was like, ""Yeah, seriously. Oh, wait...""

I hadn't heard about the harassment allegations. He's had a pretty squeaky clean reputation since his comeback, which he credits to his wife (who was his make-up artist during his bad boy years)."

Again, YES, Dan Schneider is probably a creep, but that blog post you posted makes a LOT of accusations for no reason. Jennete and Ariana were fucking Dan to get their own shows, everyone hated them for it, etc. etc. Those are horrible things to say without evidence. Even if you believe Dan Schneider is a predator (and I do), gossip blogs that throw random people under the bus in an attempt to prove it without a single bit of evidence is not the way to prove anything."

The Other Network in Trouble.

This source is absolutely no different from the others that have been given to me. A blog from some faceless ""reporter"" reporting on a bunch of fan speculation without a single person in the actual industry commenting on it.

I *know* all the rumors. I grew up in the 90s, I've read all the same hearsay and blogs. The only *actual* evidence of any of this is his weird framing of the girls in his show. Again, proof he is a creep, but without a single person willing to come out and say it's something more, that's all we can say it is. How do these sources have soooooo many people who supposedly claim this stuff, yet not a single name of a source has ever been leaked?

Edit: and to clarify: Yes, I do think he is probably a predator in some capacity. But at the same time, no, none of this is actual proof. Claiming all of this is true without any proof is only harmful to the girls who have been on his shows. When/if one of them speaks out, THEN support them, but until then stop trying to make them victims that they might not even be."

The movie is based on a cult documentary of the same name, filmed in the late 1960s. Once a rich, high society family, the Beales were virtually broke when they appeared in the documentary. The mother, Big Edie, is a bitter old woman who squabbles constantly at middle-aged Little Edie, an aspiring singer who is thrilled to be on camera.

Life is a simulation but Forest is the one to create the simulation.  So like we can be gods to a simulated universe, which is a perfect simulation of our universe so effectively the same universe?"
2058,2020-03-28 15:09:15,fqi86w,"Excellent points. There are so many biblical references to the crucifixion in the story. I feel like they are headed for the resurrection of Lily. 

Forest wants to walk into the simulation with a living version of his daughter. If they scan something and extrapolate out to include Forest, his daughter would still be dead in the simulation. They were able to reverse death of a simulated mouse. Lily is the test case of reversing death in a simulated human.

When they do that I think something will go wrong. Perhaps if her consciousness becomes intertwined with the computer and if the Copenhagen interpretation is correct, Lily will be able to collapse the wave function and become god like and perform miracles. Maybe even raising the dead :) That's probably a little too Neo in The Matrix, so I doubt they go there, but I think the resurrection breaking the quantum computer happens."

Yeah I feel like these thoughts in the post here by u/blue__sky really  hit  the  nail  on  the  head  in  terms  of  what  the Devs  team intends to do with  Lily,  creepy  though  it  may  be.    Especially  considering  the  picture  of  Lily  you  see  being  used  in  a  marketing  ad  of  some  kind  that  makes  her  look  like  a  messiah  figure  with  a  glowing  halo,  or  certain  recurring  images  that  appeared  in  Ep.  4  or  Ep.  5  where  she  had  her  arms  out  in  a  ‚Äùcrucifiction‚Äù  pose  ‚Äî  Id  say    ‚Äúresurrection‚Äù  is  an  interesting  way  to  look  at what  their  experiment  is  going  to  exist  of.

But how would they go about it?  Is it really going to be the mouse thing on the lager scale?   OR is there a way to use the machine to actually prevent her death in the first place ‚Äî even though they‚Äòve already SEEN a death they view as being no less real than one thats already happened??

I have a feeling they are up to this 2nd method, and that it might have something to do with a trick from another classic science fiction film that has a lot of parallels to *Devs.* Maybe Ill try to explain in a future post, but I bet a lot of others have already guessed it and made the prediction elsewhere ..."
2065,2020-03-29 01:48:24,fqi86w,"Well thank you sir, yeah I knew when I saw Alex Garland was writing/directing that it was going to be interesting.   I think his films tend to be significantly underrated for some reason, but Ive really dug his storytelling style all the way bk to when I read the novel *The Beach (*which they made that DiCaprio movie out of).

2083,2020-03-27 05:22:49,fpqkuc,It is feasible even for poor people. All you need is contacts/friends in the right place.
2084,2020-03-27 05:43:41,fpqkuc,"Possible, but not sure how likely it is.  Flights in and out are tracked.  As an example I know of someone who is a pilot and owns a place from both the mainland and Tassie, and chose to self isolate at their Tassie property (which has an airstrip).  They flew into Devonport, were checked by biosecurity, etc. and then flew on to their own property.

Arriving by boat - the smaller the boat, the harder it would be to get across Bass Strait, and larger boats would be less likely to get across unnoticed.  Not impossible though."
2085,2020-03-27 10:05:54,fpqkuc,Totally. Look at Johnny Depp and his partner flouting animal quarantine a few years ago.
2086,2020-03-28 13:05:14,fpqkuc,"absolutely. i trust the australian government about as far as i can throw them, it's all about who you know. just take a look at centrelink, it's way easier to get something done if you know someone who works there, if you don't, be prepared for months of back and forth where they lose your documents, re-discover your documents, input data incorrectly, a shit ton of crap that is just like that. from what i've experienced, there isn't any reason to expect anything different from other government run things (like border ""security"")"
2087,2020-03-27 05:38:50,fpqkuc,"It is feasible for anyone. Tasmania lacks the resources to implement even the tiniest fraction of the restrictions the politicians are spouting.  
Huge mouth, no trousers."
2088,2020-04-05 12:47:28,fpqkuc,Dutton will hook you up!
2089,2020-03-27 05:45:31,fpqkuc,"Is it unrealistic for a speedboat full of drugs or out of season abalone etc to whiz between vic and tas, like you might see between Miami and Cuba?"
2090,2020-03-27 06:50:21,fpqkuc,"I didn't want to say it that openly. After all, I am quite new here, but yeah... I wouldn't think there is some significant chance to truly enforce the quarantine in our state."
2091,2020-03-27 10:03:25,fpqkuc,"No, it has definitely happened in the past. https://www.theage.com.au/national/jail-again-for-a-serial-abalone-poacher-20041211-gdz6bg.html"
2092,2020-03-27 04:19:33,fpqddk,"Yeah, OKAY. I live in CA, we don't have any work or any fucking money right now. The national guard is taking over, no one here cares about little midwest."
2093,2020-03-27 04:44:58,fpqddk,what are $1 wells?
2094,2020-03-27 05:01:27,fpqddk,Call her out on her post. It‚Äôs your sisterly duty.
2095,2020-03-27 06:48:55,fpqddk,"Guys will say all sorts of things for a number of reasons. Boredom, a little ego boost. Who knows. No one is legit booking her a flight to come stay on their boat with them."
2096,2020-03-27 05:06:09,fpqddk,I think it's referring to the well drinks/liquor at a bar. They are the cheapest available.
2097,2020-03-27 05:02:55,fpqddk,"When I strike, it will be at the right time. Till then, I patiently sit back and wait for the right post to warrant that reaction from me."
2098,2020-03-27 06:27:47,fpiulc,"Bruh some of the worst takes I've seen not gonna lie chief. The Loss getting a 2/5? Saying Deuce's verse ruins Pimpin' when it's arguably the best part of the song?

Giving this review a 2/5"
2099,2020-03-26 22:32:14,fpiulc,"Great review and while I disagree in some areas I respect your opinion as a fellow HU fan. Here‚Äôs my personal ratings:

Undead: 5/5
Sell Your Soul: 3/5
Everywhere I Go: 4/5
No Other Place: 3/5
No. 5: 4/5
Young: 4/5
Black Dahlia: 4/5
This Love, This Hate: 3/5
Bottle and a Gun: 3/5
California: 3/5
City: 5/5
The Diary: 3/5
Pimpin‚Äô: 2/5
Paradise Lost: 3/5
Pain: 4/5
Knife Called Lust: 2/5
The Natives: 4/5
Bitches: 3/5
The Loss: 2/5
The Kids: 1/5
Circles: 2/5

If you‚Äôre doing American tragedy next and I see the post you‚Äôre gonna see a lot of 5‚Äôs in my personal thoughts. It‚Äôs by far my favourite album. Also for my way of ranking if it‚Äôs a song rated 1 then I instantly have to be able to skip it upon recognising the song, and for a 2 the song has to be not that great, like a ‚Äòmeh‚Äô. 3 is solid/decent, 4 is very good/awesome and 5 is top 10 or 15 of all time material."
2100,2020-03-26 22:49:30,fpiulc,Finally a real long term fan of the band.
2101,2020-03-27 03:13:16,fpiulc,"Young is my favorite too. That final bridge with Johnny, Deuce, Charlie, and Da Kurlzz always gives me chills every single time."
2102,2020-03-27 03:56:16,fpiulc,Will you be doing the tracks that aren‚Äôt covers from Desperate Measures?
2103,2020-03-27 05:34:51,fpiulc,"Undead: 4/5 Sell Your Soul: 5/5 Everywhere I Go: 3/5 No Other Place: 3/5 No. 5 4/5 Young: 4/5 Black Dahlia: 3/5 This Love, This Hate: 2/5 Bottle and a Gun: 2/5 California: 3/5 City: 4/5 The Diary: 4/5 Pimpin‚Äô: 3/5 Paradise Lost: 4/5 Pain: 4/5 The Natives: 2/5 Knife Called Lust: 4/5 The Loss: 2/5 Bitches: 2/5 The Kids: 1/5 Circles: 3/5"
2104,2020-03-27 06:42:11,fpiulc,"I definitely respectfully disagree with nearly every rating and comment about each song on this review, but then again, I also adore this album because it means so much to me. i'm just probably biased I guess lol."
2105,2020-03-27 13:44:08,fpiulc,"Ah, yikes. I guess it‚Äôs like that sometimes with the subjectivity of music, but we‚Äôll see if we agree more on later albums"
2106,2020-03-27 02:59:03,fpiulc,"I‚Äôm interested to see the difference in some of these tracks honestly. That‚Äôs super cool, and I‚Äôm thankful I haven‚Äôt been murdered for my different opinion lmao
And yeah, American Tragedy is a fantastic album, it‚Äôs gonna he hard to rank it and near impossible to pick a 1/5"
2107,2020-03-27 03:02:21,fpiulc,"Yeah, it was crazy when I realised it‚Äôs been 12 years, and while the last few years it‚Äôs usually been a case of listening to the band when a new album comes out and going back to all of their stuff, listening to it all together for a few months before going back to other music and waiting for the next album, I‚Äôve never been at a point where I dislike the band."
2108,2020-03-27 03:27:33,fpiulc,Glad it‚Äôs not just me that adores this track!
2109,2020-03-27 04:00:19,fpiulc,"Likely not, the idea was to do the 6 main studio albums, so I won‚Äôt be doing Psalms either"
2110,2020-03-27 13:42:27,fpiulc,"Perhaps. The first half of the album and a few tracks do hold a special place for my heart too, but hey, hopefully we‚Äôll agree more in the later albums!"
2111,2020-03-27 03:20:52,fpiulc,"Yeah, the band's music has changed so much since 2008 that band was in a way similar until A.T but the changes were apprent when NFTU released. Personally the band has been the only consistent band even with the changes. The weakest album comparable imho is D.O.T.D. to be fair even that album did well. HU seems to keeps things fresh as a band. Can't believe that ""Undead"" was 2007/2008."
2112,2020-03-27 04:05:13,fpiulc,Okay! Either way I‚Äôm definitely gonna follow along with this. I think your idea is super cool!
2113,2020-03-27 04:24:19,fpiulc,"Thank you! I‚Äôll probably do each album every day, as it took about 2 hours to do Swan Songs due to listening to each song again before reviewing it"
2114,2020-03-26 18:05:53,fpgbk6,Personally excited for new Dirty Projectors and Pearl Jam

2167,2020-04-04 22:33:42,fo7s1x,"Teaching. I taught college for a little while but have made the move to teaching younger students (middle school and high school) and am loving it. College students were more savvy and I could delve deeper with them, but the younger kids are more creative and excited and I get to teach a broader array of topics. In college I really only taught medieval European topics. With middle schoolers I teach a more global medieval history (with lots of focus on Asia), plus I get to teach modern world history to high schoolers which I think is also fun. So there are some options if you want to get a PhD. Just realize that the academic job market is NOT good so keep your options open beyond academia."
2168,2020-03-25 16:46:48,fo7s1x,"I tried to pick a couple out that are more synthetic in nature, and that speak more to medieval mentalities than the typical site report. It's true that a lot of archaeological literature is typically a laundry list of items and soil types. When reading that type of literature, it's usually best to read the abstract and the discussion sections first going back to the ""middle parts"" if you want to know something specific. One of my favorite reports I read was simply a 2 page conclusion in some locally published journal that simply aggregated the results of a series of excavations in a small part of Oxford.

Good archaeological analysis is the synthesis of site reports that usually have a historian either editing or contributing in some other way. I tried to go with that with some of my recommendations."
2169,2020-03-24 21:50:34,fo7s1x,"That's fair. We likely disagree on the the Koziol/Buc argument, and that's ok."
2170,2020-03-26 20:15:34,fo7s1x,"The fact that it is a polemical discourse is exactly why it is interesting to read these historians. But as Florian Mazel said in *F√©odalit√©s, 888-1180*, nowadays, french historians  lean less towards the ""feudal mutation"" (at its peak with *La mutation f√©odale, Xe-XIIe*, by Poly et Bournazel) than towards the generalized, but uneven evolution of medieval society from the IXth to the XIIIth century.

I would not dare to speak for all French historiography, but J√©r√¥me Baschet's synthesis is really good. In my opinion, it is one of the greatest Middle Ages synthesis in french. And it is not based on the feudal society itself, but rather on the evolution of the medieval society, so it is less a subject of controversy. Baschet also follows the same path as Alain Guerreau and his wife, Anita Guerreau-Jalabert.

In the french historiography, J√©r√¥me Baschet, Georges Duby, Robert Fossier, Alain Guerreau and Dominique Iogna-Prat are essential to help better understand the medieval society and its evolution.

These books may not be the best for a beginner in the subject, but anyone who reads french and who is seriously interested in the Middle Ages should know these.

Also, the fact that there may be some traces of debate left is a good indicator that the discussion must go on, so why avoid it when you can participate?"

But, as it stands, that doesn't exist, and I, too, think her book has to go on reading lists.

The material can be previously published but, remember, new thinking comes along all the time, so more recent publications may be needed to refute her book. 

I read that review a few months ago when someone tried to use it as proof her book was poorly written. The thing is, it doesn't provide any evidence where she is wrong. Lots of people look down their noses at her book without offering any proof. That's all I'm asking for. For a group of people who claim to be evidence-based, no one to this day has considered offering even a shred of proof to discredit her book. I don't say this as a supporter of her book (as of now I'm neutral), I say this as a critic of her critics. And justifiably so. It's time for them to put their money where their mouths are."

For ""academics"" to say it's not worth their lofty time is to invite belief in her supposed interpretation. It's time for them to get up from their circle jerk, wash their hands, and do something about it. We live in times where people can make the most ridiculous of claims without proof. Not challenging them leads to their claims spreading and causing wider problems. For this, look no further than flat-earthers. The world, academics included, didn't take them seriously, and now we have a problem. The time is long past for passively assuming the general public will read a dozen books on the topic and form the correct opinion. It requires a little more proactive approach, and I still find it weak on the part of so-called academics who don't want to do something about it.

What can they write? That's easy, and it doesn't have to be done all by one person. Just take 10-12 major assertions she made and write about why her thinking is faulty. It must not--and I repeat, must NOT--be written in an arrogant, high-minded manner. Respectfully address each of her assertions in a scholarly, well-researched, well-referenced, peer-reviewed work. Do everything above board, in a manner many claim her book was not. That way, whenever anyone in the future recommends her book or makes a statement referencing her book as support, people can link to actual proof rather than a book review by some dude who, himself without proof, didn't like it.

(In case I haven't mentioned it enough, it's worth reiterating: we need more people offering proof. We are in a current world situation where proof isn't being brought forward enough. It's going to take some time to get people back into the mindset of demanding proof, and here is an opportunity to be a part of the solution, and not the problem.)"

2187,2020-03-26 14:17:53,fo7s1x,"There's two problems as I see it:

1. As per Brandolini's Law, very few people have the time to exhaustively refute on a point by point basis.  In my experience, once you've exhausted one issue, then the prosecuter says 'Well what about this then' and then you have to start all over again (akin to a Gish Gallop).  You end up having to fight multiple arguments made (often) in bad faith, by people who are not actually attempting to come to an understanding - and this leads to 
2.  that it's a fact of human nature that when refuted, people do not change their minds, but entrench in their previous position (this is called the backfire effect).  Maybe somebody is looking to change their minds, but if you're not willing to take the Ivory Tower's review of the issue as being solid, why would you take the Ivory Tower's point by point review as sound?"

2189,2020-03-26 14:39:25,fo7s1x,"Fair enough. No one is asking for a point by point rebuttal to her entire book. Somewhere around 10-12 of her major assertions would be enough to discredit the book and give ample reason for people to not read or recommend it. That's not asking too much.

The second point is true, except it's not die-hard believers that need to be convinced. It's those on the fence. If there can be a decent reply to her work that proves any inaccuracy, you'll have fewer people picking it up in the first place, or you'll get those who read it being more critical from the get-go. It's all the people who are casual observers to any discussion surrounding this book who notice that academics haven't provided anything to refute it, despite its mass reach."
2190,2020-03-26 02:15:15,fo7s1x,"Actually, contrary to your assertion, you can educate people. It's just so much easier to do it proactively. It was working for quite a while, and things were improving on all fronts. Then two things happened: the academic world dropped the ball by thinking everyone had been educated; and social agitators, mostly for political reasons, started sowing discord. If academics had had their finger on the social pulse, they could've headed this off. Instead, like the CIA, they're now playing catch-up. 

As to bias, if there are enough disparate people offering independently researched writings which come to the same conclusion, then we can rule out bias. 

Furthermore, to say that no one will read an inane 50-year-old book is part of the problem. People are reading it. People are recommending it. That's akin to saying no one will read Mein Kampf or that everyone knows the Holocaust happened. To make those assumptions is to be a part of the problem--not in the sense of actively supporting and promoting it, but by passively standing by and doing nothing, which allows it to happen.

""Academics"" need to come down from their hallowed, institutional ivory tower, have a drink with the unwashed, and get a sense of what's really going on in the world and what people are reading, doing, and saying. The fight for evidence- and proof-based reasoning could use some support.

Finally, how can we start believing experts again if they don't offer proof, especially since flat-earthers, climate-deniers, anti-vaxers, etc have ""experts"", too? They have so-called experts, but they don't really have proof. Not real proof, just enough vague uncertainty to muddy the waters. Now, please, offer some proof of the inaccuracies in A Distant Mirror."
2191,2020-03-26 19:50:54,fo7s1x,"I understand the request, and I've felt the same way in other areas I'm unfamiliar with (the solution was simply to read as much as I can).

>The second point is true, except it's not die-hard believers that need to be convinced. It's those on the fence.

Again, my response would be if you're not persuaded by the academy's perspective on it, then how are you capable of evaluating the 10-12 paragraphs?  All you will be able to see is that there are indeed, some specific problems with it, but you yourself won't be able to evaluate it as you don't have the overall background in the subject (hence why you're fence-sitting).  Explaining the historiography takes time, and there's no guarantee that you will understand it or have the resources to verify it, a fact generated by your request.

Normally, the point by point rebuttals tend to come from bloggers (for examples in other areas, see reviews on Freeman's *Closing of the Western Mind* [here](http://www.bede.org.uk/closing.htm), and also [here](http://armariummagnus.blogspot.com/2009/06/closing-of-western-mind-by-charles.html), and also [William Manchester's A World Lit Only by Fire](https://medievalhistorygeek.wordpress.com/2010/04/02/book-review-a-world-lit-only-by-fire/) and also [here](http://vaultingvellum.blogspot.com/2010/05/world-lit-only-by-misconceptions-1.html)) but even in some of the reviews, they will pick out issues, case in point:

From Wood: 

>...Mrs Tuchman has used Froissart as her major source, frequently backing him up with Gibbon and Michelet, almost inevitably *A Distant Mirror* reads as a curiously dated and old fashioned work.

and 

>This is a point that Mrs Tuchman does not see. The historical views of the philosophic Gibbon are fundamentally incompatible with those of that Romantic tribune of the heroic people, Michelet, but she uses them both, frequently, approvingly, and totally without discrimination. In so doing, she fails to understand that this is hopelessly to mix her literary genres, thereby creating a book in which form can do little but war
with content.

and

>...she knows that the Sultan, Murad I, was killed after the battle by a dying Serb, but appears not to appreciate that Kossovo took place on June 28 or that its anniversary subsequently became the great Serbian national holiday, Vidov Dan. These facts are not without their significance if history is a mirror, for it was on that day of all days, 525 years later at Sarajevo, that another foreign prince dared set foot on the fatherlands sacred soil and was himself assassinated for the impiety, thus ushering in the guns of August.

Bachrach:

> Readers of Tuchman's earlier works will be particularly disappointed to learn that her generalizations
about medieval warfare are grossly inaccurate. Her discussions of individual psychology and group psychology are equally foolish. She seems to have little understanding of what motivated the people about whom she writes and generally resorts to cliche such as chivalry or indivdual neuroses as explanations. *A Distant Mirror* makes clear by what it is not that the American reading public deserves access to history that holds a middle ground between the unreadable monograph and unreliable gossip.

Explaining all of that will take pages of work (and the necessary referencing), and it's just not that worth it for the reasons I gave at the beginning. Had Tuchman been a medievalist, then maybe some more effort would have been put into specifics, but given the chance to read books by experts in my area, vs popular writers, I'm going with the former.  It makes better sense to ignore a rebuttal and simply suggest better works and perhaps then you can circle back and understand Tuchman.

To be clear, some reviewers understand the issues but still think it's nice writing (although that may be damning with faint praise...) but I don't see mediaevalists thinking that it's worth much effort."

2193,2020-03-27 02:02:05,fo7s1x,"I think you'd be surprised how much offering proof of one's assertions can help dispel arguments.  Simply providing the arrow pointing to the proof would even make this little discussion cease.  Not providing any proof is what has led to this situation of her book still being read and recommended.  Someone needs to provide the proof.  If not academics, then who?

You raise a good point about bloggers potentially picking up the mantle, but that has its own issues of reliability.  I don't think it's a good idea to let bloggers run rampant with their ideas, as that would be a similar situation to Tuchman's book, which seems to be what academics would like to avoid.  At best, it would have to be bloggers who provide proof of their assertions, and it would have to be read and recommended by academics.  It seems to be the best solution; not ideal, but workable.

What we seem to have is a bunch of adults standing around watching some kids fighting but doing nothing about it because they'd rather talk to each other about the stock market.  Academics are basically saying that these kids have been taught in the past by adults not to fight, so kids shouldn't fight.  Letting bloggers do the heavy lifting is like hoping some other kids come along and stop the fight because it's not worth those adults' time.  They're too busy with other things they deem more important.  Again I ask, if not academics, then who?

I have previously read those two reviewers you referenced (I think I found them from Wikipedia).  Ironically, that's what got me noticing in the first place that there was no proof offered in their reviews (although, I admit, that Wood guy does the best).  That also got me noticing that no one I have come across so far offers any proof in their discussion of her book either.  That has me more than a little surprised...and disappointed.

If I were to ask for 3 - 5 books you would recommend in my situation, what would they be?  I would like something available to and readable by the general public, accurate, without much controversy, and accepted by academics.  I would like something that details life in the High Middle Ages (around the 12th-14th centuries, give or take), preferably continental Europe--ideally France, considering this discussion, but not necessarily.  I would like something that discusses historical events, including warfare and political maneuverings, and also daily life and living conditions of the people.  All of this does not have to be contained in one book, it can be spread out variously over the 3 - 5 books.  I don't want a general reading list and be told to pick whatever catches my fancy.  I'd like 3 - 5 specific recommendations that you would like to see the general public read, in an order from easiest or most general to more difficult and most in-depth.  That sort of a list may help in this situation."
2194,2020-03-26 14:24:00,fo7s1x,"And still more comments without proof of your assertions.

The ""ivory tower"" comment was regarding an institutional insularity, not a financial distinction. Yes, you are here, yet you're not trying very hard to bridge the gap. You'll have to come down a few more pegs yet.

No one is asking you to write anything. All you have to do is provide a link to an article (or as many as you know of)--whose thesis doesn't even have to be specifically about Tuchman's book--which disproves some assertion she made. It can't be that hard."
2195,2020-03-28 22:29:18,fo7s1x,"Heh, I am exactly the wrong person for this because my areas are in Anglo-Saxon and then Early Modern, skipping the High Middle ages.

*That said*, I have read a few and have gathered some feel for it so with that caveat I would suggest (some are from the list above, and that list is a good one if you can afford the variety):

* Wickham - Framing the Middle Ages
* Bisson - The Crisis of the Twelfth Century
* Huizinger - The Waning of the Middle Ages (because it's the grandaddy)
* Constance - The Reformation of the 12th Century


And then check for bibliographies at the back (or even in Gbooks).

If you're not already familiar with [Oxford Bibliographies](https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/page/medieval-studies), they are a good way of getting into the main studies of the periods - you have to subscribe to get fuller lists, but to be honest, it's enough of a start without subscription.

The other way if you know nothing about an area, is try something like [In Our Time](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01hb3y1) (I've linked to the Mediaeval bit) - they may not have the topic you're looking for, but the newer episodes have started putting in bibliographies if you want to know more, otherwise have a listen and follow the lecturer's names as most of them have written the subject.

I won't hold you to it, but it's interesting to see someone say her book may not be factually inaccurate. Or at least no one, that you have come across, has leveled that accusation against the book. 

Unfortunately, you can probably guess what I'm going to suggest next. Despite all your arguments to the contrary, when a book has had this much reach, someone is going to have to compile a list of works that, directly or indirectly, refute her interpretation. Yes, academics can tell laypeople to look it up themselves, just the same way they probably told the first flat-earthers to go read a science book. And look where that's got us.

I want to reiterate I'm not suggesting you. But, all it takes is a few academics actually reading her book (gasp!), recalling or looking up a few articles or chapters of books on where her interpretation is incorrect, compiling a list of about 10-12 major points, then putting it on the internet under a heading that will be easily picked up when people do a search on the topic. The onus will then be on us to read it, but the arrow directing us to the proof will have been drawn. The average reader with an interest in the Middle Ages will take it from there. (I suggest academics do this because they should have the resources and expertise to do this efficiently and correctly.)

I know you like to refer to that Bernie guy, but I want you to understand how little that flies as any kind of actual proof. He's just a dude we've never heard of who has an opinion. Send us to peer-reviewed articles which reference their source material, and it will start to build a foundation of credibility. Basically, do it the opposite of the way Tuchman's book supposedly did it. It has to be done the correct way.

As it stands, for one reason or another, no one wants to do this. We have this situation where academics believe inaccurate information is being spread, and they just wish it would passively go away by itself. It won't. Until such time as academics see the need to do something about it, I hope Tuchman's book continues to be read, and I hope people continue to ask academics about it."

2200,2020-03-26 23:26:44,fo7s1x,"Regarding that Bernie guy's review, I'm letting you know the problem of anyone, even if they are as well regarded as you say he is, not offering proof for their statements. His review offers zero proof,and that's the problem. He wants people to believe him, not for the conviction of his argument, but because of how people perceive him. People can't rest on their laurels like that. It invites others to come in and make potentially erroneous claims. Absolutely everything has to be updated and reaffirmed for each successive generation. If this isn't done, we'll just have more flat-earthers, etc. Humans society has never followed the idea of once heard, always believed. Societal memories are short, and the people are easily swayed by what they've been hearing most recently. Hence, the reason for academics to stay on top of things.

I never said I wanted people to read inaccurate history. I said I wanted people to read this book in the effort to get academics to compile a list proving any inaccuracies it may have. No one, including you in all you have said so far, has offered any proof that her interpretation is inaccurate. If no one is going to do that, the perception will continue to be that the book is not inaccurate.

The funny thing is, for all the time you have spent above defending why academics aren't going to spend any time refuting this book, you could've done a little digging and found a couple of essays or chapters of books that potentially disprove one of her assertions. Spread that out across a couple more academics, and the nail could be put in the coffin."

I believe that--in the short term, until academics accept the need to engage more fully with the public to dispel misconceptions--addressing anti-vax, flat-earth, climate-denying issues could potentially increase their exposure.  But, a respectful, scientific, united, constant front against those issues will cause it to wane.  It will never cause it to go away, for the reasons you have listed.  However, so long as the lesson has been learned by academics of the need to always maintain vigilance and to be constantly proving, re-proving, and circulating their findings among the general public, in a way that they can read and understand, it can keep those issues from resurfacing and new ones from arising.

I do agree (somewhat) with your comment about humans being irrational and unreasonable creatures.  Where I disagree is that, relatively speaking, we were improving.  The last little while (couple of decades) has seen a regression.  We can be better.  Even now, certain countries and societies are noticeably more rational and reasonable than others.  There's a reason for that, but it requires effort and the right attitude.  It requires reasonable and rational people to stop saying ""I'd rather not have to bother...""."

I will weigh ""expert"" opinion a little more heavily, but there have been cases in the past where so-called expert opinion has been wrong.  That alone won't tip the balance.  At any given point in human history, people have been pretty impressed with all that they felt they have known, only to be disproved by some new thinking.  That's why I'm trying more and more to insist on proof.  It's some up-front work to head off the potential for later problems.

I have friends we spend hours looking on social media at these ideal bodies and different workouts to hit different spots.

2255,2020-04-20 22:20:24,g4qzqq,"it masquerades as health

old school thinspo was explicitly based around unhealthy lifestyles - heroin chic, skipping meals and mainlining coffee bc you're \~so\~ overworked and driven - prioritising professional productivity over personal health, black and white thinspo littered with cigarettes and skipping meals. 

fitspo tells itself and everyone looking at it that its healthy, that its the proper way to sustain your health, that if you're not living in this restrictive, competitive way, then you're not as virtuous and healthy as they are. in a lot of ways, i think thats more dangerous than the other kind. it has a righteousness to it that from the outside can be really compelling, especially if you havent been exposed to truths around nutrition and calorie counting. you probably just think these people are genetic miracles, and not people who lie on the internet for clout to make themselves, i dont know, feel better about whatever it is they're lacking in their personal lives.

the main problem for me is that exercise and eating vegetables and drinking water ARE healthy. thats how you lose weight or tone your body in a healthy way. but fitspo takes that, and completely discards any  aspect of moderation. fitspo scores it down into something restrictive and compulsive and passes it off as effortless. i fucking hate seeing bikini ig models with 0.5 percent body fat posing with massive meals and half open mouths like they eat stuff like that everyday. fuck you for spreading that narrative. its fucking gilmore girls all over again, except at least gilmore girls didn't pretend like spending 6 hours in the gym everyday was an achievable and healthy lifestyle choice.

2260,2020-04-20 16:43:26,g4qzqq,"This is kind of my point though. They *are* toned, but still look very underweight and the amount they eat (the ones who do those videos, in any case) is far too little. How can they not see the hypocrisy in this?! They condemn people who have a f\*cked up way of looking at food, like us, the people who have an eating disorder, but they perpetuate that ideal themselves?! Because there's no way someone like Caroline Daisler (spelling?) got that figure because she lived so 'healthy'. 

Yet somehow, because they aim for a bit of muscle mass, it's suddenly okay and we - the people who are at least honest about the struggle and that we are, in fact, starving ourselves for that figure - are somehow the bad guys?"

People who have emotional support animals tend to abuse their rights and think they have just as much rights as a trained service dog. I‚Äôve seen some people buy bright pink service dog vests off of amazon and slap it on their animal. It‚Äôs disrespectful and discredits the people who actually train their dog. That being said, I think it‚Äôs very extreme to disregard someone‚Äôs anxieties. Emotional support animals can help those people who need it.

Or you could say that the emotional support animals should be service animals, instead. Idk."
2273,2020-04-19 03:22:24,g400fl,"I think they can be service animals, but most people abuse the system and it is making it worse for the legitimate ones."
2274,2020-04-19 02:44:36,g400fl,"I agree, and I think this opinion is more popular than you think amongst those without an ESA. It‚Äôs great that your pet is giving you mental health benefits, but they are not service animals."

2278,2020-04-19 08:58:59,g400fl,"the problem isnt the ESAs necessarily, the problem is people not training their ESAs and abusing the system. i have thought about registering my dog as an ESA but i know he isnt well trained enough. people just like to register ESAs so they can take their pets everywhere, as opposed to the people who actually need an animal to support and calm them."

2282,2020-04-19 06:41:44,g400fl,"They arent by definition though.
Confusing the two is common enough but that there is a difference is a popular opinion and on the books by law."

2285,2020-04-19 07:15:41,g400fl,"Agreed. Professionals here in germany also highly doubt the usefullness of ESA, maybe that's why they aren't common here."
2286,2020-04-19 05:06:46,g400fl,"An emotional support animal serves its purpose to those who need emotional support. Those who claim it to be an emotional support animals without any proof or backing just want to be around their pets. 

Since you are so inconvenienced by my support animal I am also deeply disturbed and inconvenienced by your wheelchair, because it takes up too much space in the elevator. I also don't like the blind man's guide dog since I have an allergy to dogs.

It is also more convenient to carry an animal in your purse. You don't want your dog squashed by the oncoming horde of shoppers, do you? It's a simple solution.

""She just had it on a leash"". What did you want her to do with it? Straddle it or make it have a ball-gag in its mouth perhaps?

The fact that you don't like to clean up a little drool because you are lazy (I'm assuming you are speaking from an employee standpoint), useless and incompetent."

2289,2020-04-19 05:32:07,g400fl,"Even of they were a service animal, you could ask them to leave if that happens I think. Even if it is a service animal, the owner has to maintain control of the animal."
2290,2020-04-19 13:51:40,g400fl,"Eh...the way the law is applied allows anyone to claim their dog as a service dog.  I worked in restaurants for a long time and people brought in all kinds of dogs that were completely untrained wearing their stupid little fake vest they bought on eBay, jumping on people, eating food off the table.  I once had a couple sit their dog on the booth and put its food on the table.  All we were allowed to say was ‚Äúyour dog needs to be under the table‚Äù, we were not allowed to ask any questions and risk a lawsuit. It‚Äôs the most idiotic system I‚Äôve ever seen. 

At the very least, service dogs should be required to have some sort of certification if requested.  I don‚Äôt want to know your disability, just verify that this dog has been trained in a service dog program. 

Actual service dogs are so obvious.  They aren‚Äôt looking around for attention/pets, they aren‚Äôt jumping or licking of distracted.  They usually have a vest in that says ‚Äúdo not approach or pet me, I‚Äôm a service dog‚Äù.  They are working.  Emotional support animals are not working, they are just pets. It‚Äôs so silly to me that we‚Äôve created a system where we have no means to distinguish the two groups."
2291,2020-04-19 08:16:34,g400fl,I live in Canada but a lot of stores here allow people to bring their pets in (especially in the summer). As long as they are well behaved and it isnt somewhere where the animal is possibly causing a health hazard usually no one says anything.
2292,2020-04-19 05:37:02,g400fl,"The Department of Justice also offers this guidance for businesses: ‚ÄúWhen it is not obvious what service an animal provides, only limited inquiries are allowed. Staff may ask two questions: (1) is the dog a service animal required because of a¬†disability, and (2) what work or task has the dog been trained to perform.

So you can ask these questions. You can also have them leave the premises if the animal misbehaves.

Edit: for clarification, the above is on the USA from a federal perspective. Other countries and local laws likely differ."
2293,2020-04-19 13:55:06,g400fl,"No we don't. You notice I said "" leave your pets at home."" What part of that makes you think I have a problem with pets at a rental house?"
2294,2020-04-19 05:48:04,g400fl,"If you have an animal with you while shopping, you have an absolute duty to maintain control of the animal. That includes cleaning up after it. If you don't want to clean up your own dog's mess and instead want to pawn it off on someone else, you are a lazy asshat and shouldn't have a pet, let alone blame your failings as a decent human being on your disability. And it makes the rest of us with mental health needs get a bad name, all because some dog owner can't maintain their dog.

There is a huge difference between an emotional support animal (where you can get a letter for $100 online) and someone in a wheelchair and it is undeniably asinine to suggest otherwise."
2295,2020-04-19 07:02:21,g400fl,"An ESA is one therapeutic option for persons with emotional/mental/physical needs. There are no alternative options for persons who need a wheelchair. 
Only on a lease, versus a handle that limits the ESA roaming range and eliminates tripping

2299,2020-04-19 05:41:58,g400fl,"If it misbehaves I totally understand. But at least in Ontario Canada where I live, we're not allowed to ask any questions especially regarding whether or not it's a real animal meant for service. 

And even if they say yes, we're not even allowed to ask for documentation to further prove so and if to do so, we would need to contact the police to conduct an investigation which is more work than it's worth."
2300,2020-04-19 05:54:00,g400fl,"I am a lawyer in the US, so I really have no good idea of the laws there. But a quick Google search showed there may be more that you can do. Here is a paste with citation following.

Documentation and certification
Under the Ontario Human Rights Code and the AODA, service animals do not need to have certificates or identity cards.

However, you may be asked to provide acceptable documentation. This includes:

documentation from a regulated health professional
an identification card from the Ontario Ministry of the Attorney General for people who are blind and use a guide dog

2466,2020-05-03 13:42:43,gcpn0a,"What is amazing is that she name drops and brags 90% less than the other HWs.  If you actually have it, you don't have to flaunt it."
2467,2020-05-03 13:43:59,gcpn0a,"In her circles it is uncouth to talk about how much money you have or where it comes from. Since she doesn‚Äôt talk about it, the other women speculate. Tinsley really is from a much higher social strata, and seeing the contrast between her behavior and the other women‚Äôs pretensions is wonderful."
2468,2020-05-03 12:46:14,gcpn0a,"Imagine If she got her ""old life"" back but had to bring the other housewives. Sonja (not the once classy Sonja but the current d√©class√© mess) and Ramona would steal the lobster under Lauren Santo Domingo's horrified eyes. (I would love to see it)

On a more serious note, I feel like people never understood why she was such a mess in her first season. Her ex (not Topper) was incredibly violent, I won't post the details here, but they're easy enough to find, and the few times she tried to discuss it with the other girls they kinda brushed it off as ""oh, we've all been in bad relationships"". They say she doesn't share much but anytime she tries they don't listen. Another example would be when she tried to talk about her father's alcoholism and Lu didn't even pretend to listen.

And the money stuff is ridiculous. Sonja kept complaining that Tinsley spent too much time shopping when she lived with her. She was single back then, so not ""laying on her back"" to get shoes.

Eta: [here's an old fashion spot thread](https://forums.thefashionspot.com/threads/tinsley-mortimer.98851/) about her (remember TFS?! They had the best tea about everyone), for those who weren't fashion obsessed teens back then. Some of the pics aren't available anymore cause it's been a while...I feel old rn."
2469,2020-05-03 13:27:20,gcpn0a,"Thank you for your fine forensic analysis. 

I‚Äôve lived in Richmond for over a decade so I‚Äôve know all about Tinsley for years, but even before that I knew about her (I grew up in OH). Tinsley was THAT BITCH. I always used to hear her referred to as Paris Hilton with class."
2470,2020-05-03 13:53:56,gcpn0a,"Read every word. Thanks for sharing! 

I also think Dorinda‚Äôs treatment of Tins is pretty ridiculous. I don‚Äôt get where all her vitriol stems from and I have come to the conclusion that she is insanely jealous. Hear me out...

Dorinda married well twice ‚Äî didn‚Äôt have to work, with the exception of raising Hannah, and seemed to be afforded many luxuries during her marriages. This season, it seems she is highly stressed about the cost of renovations at Blue Stone Manor. And there are many allusions to John not being able to ‚Äútake care of her properly.‚Äù 

Personally, I think Richard‚Äôs money is running out and she is stressed about finances, which I‚Äôll admit, must be hard. Then she sees Tinsley not working and being able to afford anything she wants and it makes her see red. The whole thing with Scott makes it worse, because Dorinda just wants a man with money to take care of her monetarily and emotionally as well ‚Äî it‚Äôs clear she is carrying many burdens. It all gets spewed out on poor Tins in a jealous rage. But, Dorinda, green is not a good look on you, honey! Get over it!

And that‚Äôs what I came here to say."

2473,2020-05-03 13:01:44,gcpn0a,"Thank you for addressing her money!! I agree, she regularly writes $10k checks for charity like I drop my extra coins in the bucket. She also doesn't seem like she's spending beyond her means either. Housewives that do that are revealed pretty quickly & there's nothing to the contrary out there about her. I loathe that Sonja questions her money & all the other HWs just accept Sonja's half-baked theory. Tinsley is NOT new to this!!"
2474,2020-05-03 13:31:34,gcpn0a,"Love this post! I honestly feel like Dorinda, Sonja and Bethenny (to an extent) are jealous af of her. Let‚Äôs be real they all joined housewives because they want to be in the public eye - she had it way before. She was THAT BITCH"
2475,2020-05-03 13:25:07,gcpn0a,Tinsley's experienced so much yet she's so modest. Thanks for digging up the dirt! THIS is the reason I love this sub.
2476,2020-05-03 13:13:39,gcpn0a,"this is what i'm here for, i love this. i need this with sonja next."
2477,2020-05-03 13:38:28,gcpn0a,"Love this - Tinsley really is a sweet person. Even with all her privilege I do feel sad for her, she is the embodiment of what it‚Äôs like to be raised to be an ornament/only for the approval of others. I think she is  coming into her own more."
2478,2020-05-03 17:04:50,gcpn0a,"You know what‚Äôs really great about Tinsley? 

She NEVER brags about any of this stuff, unlike Sonja, Dorinda, Luann, Ramona, etc.

She went to Columbia and yet you never hear her making a big deal out of it. She worked for Vogue, and yet she never brings it up. She has a Master‚Äôs Degree. Again, no bragging. 

She was an ‚Äúit‚Äù girl whose style was emulated by one of the characters on Gossip Girl and yet...she never brings it up, is never obnoxious about it and seems pretty humble, all things considered. 

Not only that, but I have never seen her treat anyone on the show with disrespect or unkindness. 

Tinsley is very much a class act. The other ladies only wish they could be her."
2479,2020-05-03 13:31:40,gcpn0a,"This is amazing! You should do a write up for all of the New York Ladies. We love them now, but often forget that they all have such interesting back stories. Great job."
2480,2020-05-03 13:09:23,gcpn0a,Thank you for this! Very interesting...good I love knowing everything about housewives lives
2481,2020-05-03 13:58:42,gcpn0a,"Love this, thank you!! Fell into the socialite rank rabbit hole last night., def recommend the New York mag story to anyone who has t read it. I definitely knew of Tinsley before she joined RHONY but it was mainly from seeing her featured in fashion mags. I must say, I was pleasantly surprised how sweet and down to earth she is on the show, certainly not what I expected from the most prolific socialite of early - mid aughts New York! Team Tinsley! I love just watching what she wears on the show - especially her ‚Äúcasual wear‚Äù of super cute sweaters & jeans."
2482,2020-05-03 14:24:49,gcpn0a,"Love this! It's crazy how even though Tinsely grew up the most privileged when it comes to this group, she comes off as the most down to earth and considerate of others. It annoys me how much Sonja projects herself onto Tins when the only thing they have in common is being blonde. Tins is sweet, classy, and for gods sakes she was not a trophy wife lol. Although even in her 40s shes super attractive and could be one if she wanted to"
2483,2020-05-03 14:30:46,gcpn0a,Stumbled upon this 2007 article about Tins and Topper... https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/21/fashion/21topper.html
2484,2020-05-03 16:11:12,gcpn0a,"One of the things that has always made me slightly but sincerely jealous is that the genuinely upper class women I've met, like the genuine old-money high society ladies, have been truly charming, like Tinsley. I'm sure there are exceptions, but the few I've met have been sweet and relaxed, gracious and kind, bright but not eggheads, funny but not bawdy. A jealous part of me wanted them to be caricatures of rich bitches, but they were actually completely lovely people. I think they don't have to strive or compete or worry, and that usually makes them nice. Or at least they are very well trained to seem like nice, charming people, and they fooled *me*."
2485,2020-05-03 14:34:26,gcpn0a,"I give her props for getting her masters degree and for all of the good work that she‚Äôs done! 

As far as the notion of ‚Äòhaving it all‚Äô being an IT girl..clearly it‚Äôs a fickle lifestyle, filled with superficiality..sounds like everyone turned on her as quickly as they took her in.

I hope that she can continue to nurture real life solid friends and possibly a true love who will have her back no matter what. She is a fun person to watch and I appreciate that she‚Äôs kind with others."
2486,2020-05-03 13:55:37,gcpn0a,"As a Tinsley fan, thank you. Your point about how Tinsley is the most kind and respectful yet the others who can never be has notable and wealthy as her are the meanest and most snobby is why I love Tinsley so much. With all that societal power, you‚Äôd assume she‚Äôd abuse it from time to time. 

I will say that I think more happened between her and Topper than her not playing her cards right. Her ex in Palm Beach was physically abusive, but it has been mentioned that Topper could have been emotionally (it was he that called her boobs ugly or something like that, for example). On the show she hadn‚Äôt clarified her timeline with Topper. And in general, when wealthy teens get married on a whim, there HAS to be something behind it. In short, I think their relationship was tumultuous on his part too rather than just the effects of Tinsley‚Äôs celebrity status."
2487,2020-05-03 14:19:42,gcpn0a,"I remember reading Tinsley's name and seeing her face multiple times in the early 2000's (I am currently in my 30's). I never really knew who she was, but she was big enough for me to remember her name when she popped in on the Housewives. 
I can't imagine what it is like to go from It Girl, to Your 15 Minutes is Over Girl. 
Like you said, at least she still has a cushy life and she's kinda popular again among a new crowd. LOL"
2488,2020-05-03 14:21:57,gcpn0a,"I read this entire post and thoroughly enjoyed it. Your writing is crisp, nicely edited, and persuasive. (Ugh, sorry, I realize I just went into teacher mode.  I teach middle school English and that sounds like one my notes on an essay!!üòÇ)

I don't understand Dorinda this season. It reminds me of a bit of Lala/Raquelle on VPR the way she is going after Tinsley. There is something dark going on with Dorinda lately. 

It's fascinating the way you broke down Tinsley's fame as a socialite and 'IT girl' just before social media became a thing.  She'd have been super famous I bet if Twitter/Insta were around throughout the aughts. 

I wonder if, after the divorce, Tinsley had stayed in NYC--would she have retained more movement in the upper echelons of NYC society? Instead of going to FL, of shed stayed in NY, maybe worked on some charity boards, kept on the scene, worked at a fashion magazine again or done PR work, would that have resulted in more collaborations for her like the one with Dior? Who knows. I bet the West Palm arrest got her dropped from quite a few 'annual event rosters'.

You're doing God's work during this quarantine, friend. Keep it up."

2490,2020-05-03 15:52:45,gcpn0a,I never understood/understand why they think she‚Äôs broke and a kept woman. She A) had a career which a lot of the ladies can‚Äôt say for themselves B) came from money and C) for sure got a hefty divorce payout.
2491,2020-05-03 21:40:24,gcpn0a,"Ramona is always saying that Tinsley doesn't ""share"" her life with them 

Maybe that means Tins doesn't share her connections with wealthy people ( and single men) that Ramona is seeking to latch onto."
2492,2020-05-03 13:32:17,gcpn0a,Did tinsley get money from her divorce or did toppers family have an iron clad prenup done?

Tins was always my favourite, along with Olivia Palermo and Fabiola Beracasa!"
2494,2020-05-03 13:29:09,gcpn0a,Maybe I'm just not a good person but reading about a life like hers makes me absolutely ache with jealousy
2495,2020-05-03 13:00:11,gcpn0a,"She has money, bags, fancy friends, fame etc but it seems what she really wants is a family and children. Guess money really can‚Äôt buy you happiness!"
2496,2020-05-03 14:03:24,gcpn0a,"Thanks for reminding me how old I am! I'm not into fashion and have always lived in the midwest, but I definitely knew who Tinsley Mortimer was. She was everywhere. I just thought everyone knew her history. Good job keeping the younger subs filled in!"
2497,2020-05-03 15:07:23,gcpn0a,"I knew exactly who Tinsley Mortimer was and was excited that she would even consider doing RHONY. I‚Äôve lived in South Texas most my life, but I am a huge magazine reader and always saw her in my fashion and gossip magazines. I kinda feel like they might have mentioned her in some novels I read at the time. You know the ones set in NYC party life in early 2000s. I tried to google it but I just kept getting hits for Tinsley‚Äôs book. Like and early Lauren Weisenberger book or something?"
2498,2020-05-03 16:43:07,gcpn0a,"I lived in NYC during Tinsley‚Äôs heyday and remember how I literally screamed when she showed up on my favorite show, Gossip Girl lol. It‚Äôs kind of amazing how she runs in a completely different circle now, and I wonder if her old NYC elite friends are still talking to her. Anyway, she‚Äôs a fascinating character and I‚Äôm surprised by how polite and sweet she is on the show, really good for her :) 

Also, I feel so old lol."
2499,2020-05-03 16:52:19,gcpn0a,I'm waiting for a Real Housewives of Chicago. Tinsley is one of my favorite housewives for all these reasons. I just find myself rooting for her.
2500,2020-05-03 22:48:18,gcpn0a,"The one thing I always point out when people question her socialite status is that she appeared on Gossip Girl as herself. Not as a character, not as a background character but as someone that's meant to make the viewers go:
 'Wow this is a fancy party if Tinsley Mortimer is there'."
2501,2020-05-03 15:50:46,gcpn0a,I love this! Tinsley is such a sweetheart and I loath how Dorinda treats her. All it does is make Dorinda look terrible.
2502,2020-05-03 18:22:01,gcpn0a,OMG thanks everyone for the 1k upvotes! And thanks for the awards!!! I‚Äôm glad people get to know Tinsley a little better through this post and the comments! Which was my sole purpose for this post.
2503,2020-05-03 22:21:07,gcpn0a,"I didn't know a thing about Tinsley before this post so I really appreciate the info! But even without knowing anything about her I did not get sugar baby vibes from her and I was PISSED when Dorinda said the ""unlike you I don't earn my money on my back"" First of all, who the fuck talks like that to someone especially unprovoked?! And also, I wish she would stand up for herself but being in abusive relationships for years really does shut down a person. Why is it always the sweet pretty ones that are treated like trash?!? The evil in this world, I tell you."
2504,2020-05-03 14:43:56,gcpn0a,"In the socialite circles she was bigger than Ivanka, Hilton or Hearst's. A super socialite. She lived the life that Sonja and Ramona dream of. Simon and Alex has offered to sacrifice a kid if they can be be a friend of a friend with Tinsley or her mom. They all climb the social ladder and Tinsley has the Penthouse with a private elevator."
2505,2020-05-03 15:40:18,gcpn0a,I am super impressed with her education. Columbia and Parsons are not easy to get into even if you have money. Even if she legacyed her way in she still graduated.
2506,2020-05-03 14:04:02,gcpn0a,"Yes!!! I was SHOCKED that they got her to do it at first- I was still under the impression she was untouchable New York elite still. Knowing how things went after I stopped reading fashion mags, I see the reasoning for her being on the show. 

Thank you for writing this up! She is so often underestimated."
2507,2020-05-03 15:08:16,gcpn0a,Can you imagine if she came on when Jill was on the cast?  Jill was worse than Ramona.
2508,2020-05-03 18:50:06,gcpn0a,"I want to hear more about her rivalry with Olivia palermo

I agree that she actually came from money I always was Wondered like didn‚Äôt she have enough money as like Adrienne maloof money like does she have more money than bethenny ? I assume so

She def has the kind of class dignity and upbringing of a debutante she kind of has what luann was preaching early seasons she def is most uppercrust of all the girls

Your post kind of reminds me of when bethenny sees her picture when they go to that bird artist house and she slike ‚Äúthere‚Äôs tinsley!‚Äù And she basically is acting like it‚Äôs coming across an old Karl‚Äôs jr ad of laris Hilton or something I always felt like bethenny was kind of jelous of tinsley"
2509,2020-05-03 13:18:56,gcpn0a,"The real shame here is after Dale was so exultant that Tinsley was BAAACK after ten years off the NY runways and UES social scene, she actually ran away from filming to be inChicago w Scott. It‚Äôs a shame she left it all that way... if something happens with Scott, she‚Äôll Never be able to make it back in New York again, much less make it back as a housewife.

Thank you so much for this entire dossier on Tinsley. She has been disrespected on the show for so long, Going back to the Bethany years, and it‚Äôs about time someone put the facts down about how successful and educated and self made and connected she really is. It‚Äôs quite a shame that Tinsley does not realize that about her self though. I think a combination of being a southern girl, and upbringing by an alcoholic father, and bad luck in that first marriage with Topper, set her up for troubled male relationships. Again thank you for the excellent think peace on Tinsley."

Last year when she was going on about wanting kids (I don‚Äôt believe she really wants kids and that‚Äôs completely fine) when she went on one date and as soon as the guy said he didn‚Äôt want kids, she was like maybe I don‚Äôt NEED kids..she would change anything about herself to please a man and it‚Äôs really sad."
2521,2020-05-03 17:36:10,gcpn0a,I was enthralled with every word of this.
2522,2020-05-03 23:29:51,gcpn0a,"My fave is Tinsley not wanting to speak about money but just saying ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like I fell off a turnip truck ok!‚Äù (At the reunion. )
... like get the point girls, we don‚Äôt need you all up in my finances! Lol"
2523,2020-05-03 19:02:21,gcpn0a,Dorinda knew that Scott wasn't paying her bills and was trying to trick her into admitting that it's funded by family money/trust fund.
2524,2020-05-03 13:50:24,gcpn0a,Thank you for this! I‚Äôve always wondered her background but it‚Äôs hard to find because there wasn‚Äôt a whole lot of social media back then.
2525,2020-05-03 13:52:00,gcpn0a,I had NO idea!!!! This is fascinating. Thank you üëèüèº
2526,2020-05-03 14:22:38,gcpn0a,"Watch her show, high society, from about 10 years ago. Last I checked it‚Äôs on YouTube."
2527,2020-05-03 15:02:38,gcpn0a,"I love tins so thanks for this! What I don‚Äôt understand which I guess could be attributed to her insecurity and wanting to ‚Äúgo back‚Äù to her glory days of being seen and out and about is why she would associate herself with women from RHs since it really is such a different strata. And of course not being anywhere near that type of society but also knowing on a smaller scale from experience from wealth, usually women from that kind of world will look down on you immensely for being associated with tv trash and not the kind of real wealth she was from. I guess she has nothing to lose? But at the same time, my ego could never handle that knowing how publicly it will be and that they‚Äôre all probably talking shit about me"
2528,2020-05-03 15:53:00,gcpn0a,I like Tinsley.
2529,2020-05-03 16:59:35,gcpn0a,Damn so she was gossip girl in real life. I‚Äôve always appreciated Tinsley for standing her ground especially when Dorinda started coming for her last season. Freaking picking fights out of nowhere.
2530,2020-05-04 01:31:12,gcpn0a,"I honestly think she‚Äôs adorable. For a woman with her upbringing she doesn‚Äôt come across as you think she would. She‚Äôs sweet - I love her personality, & she‚Äôs a real person."
2531,2020-05-04 03:14:19,gcpn0a,A descendant of Thomas Jefferson?!? Wow!! Thank you for sharing this post.! I loved it.
2532,2020-05-04 03:40:28,gcpn0a,I love Tinsley! I‚Äôll be sad if she moves to Chicago and isn‚Äôt on housewives anymore.
2533,2020-05-03 13:56:07,gcpn0a,This was amazing!! I had no idea and never found any of this information while looking her up
2534,2020-05-03 14:27:00,gcpn0a,Love this. I used to read about Tinsley and all those It Girls online at the start of the century and your writing took me back.
2535,2020-05-03 15:05:50,gcpn0a,I like Tinsley too. Thanks for the good read
2536,2020-05-03 15:31:41,gcpn0a,"Thank for this post I read every single word so carefully. Awesome writing! And thank you for educating me about Tins, I‚Äôm in my 20s so I‚Äôd don‚Äôt know about her background and past at all. She‚Äôs a real class act."
2537,2020-05-03 15:51:35,gcpn0a,"I was a bumpkin at college in Wisconsin and even I knew who Tinsley was because of The City/Olivia Palermo (what ever happened to HER, by the way, can you do a piece on her)? I was super excited to see she was on the Housewives, but I didn‚Äôt know much about her (and love all these details, thanks!) and I think she‚Äôs great so far!"
2538,2020-05-03 16:22:02,gcpn0a,"This was a cool read, thanks.

I was not aware of her before HW but this just makes me like her even more!"
2539,2020-05-03 16:44:30,gcpn0a,"Thank you for this important post supporting other women. I‚Äôm about to go finish reading it, but I‚Äôm already impressed with you."
2540,2020-05-03 17:36:26,gcpn0a,Ok OP BLESS YOU! On Friday I was wishing I could find some fun bio on Tins like this and here you are with that and more!!!
2541,2020-05-03 21:16:48,gcpn0a,"Wow loved this! quick question tho- why isn't this really reflected on the show? 

Even aside from the women downplaying her status, the show doesn't display her as this ultra-name. Aside from the subtle hints (which, in the eyes of the ignorant--me--, often go unnoticed), she seems along the same lines of the other women.. lucky divorcees (i still love them all but in my view this is what it boils down to)"
2542,2020-05-04 01:24:50,gcpn0a,"Loved this, thank you for taking the time to write this out."
2543,2020-05-04 03:14:02,gcpn0a,I feel like you represented Tinsley and her backstory more than herself or bravo have. Maybe it‚Äôs just me but I haven‚Äôt really seen more than the surface of her personality. It‚Äôs getting boring hearing about Scott or if she had a curl in her hair or nott...
2544,2020-05-04 19:28:46,gcpn0a,I‚Äôm always a fan of background information... thanks for taking the time to do that research
2545,2020-05-03 14:45:14,gcpn0a,You forgot that RHONY isn't her first reality show either.
2546,2020-05-03 18:29:08,gcpn0a,Thank you for this!! Tinz deserves justice for her legend status. Especially because she‚Äôs still a sweetheart and hasn‚Äôt become bitter and hateful like Sonja and Dorinda <3
2547,2020-05-03 19:11:54,gcpn0a,I used to subscribe to Vanity Fair back in the late 90's early 00's. That is where I knew Tinsley from. Her name and face was always in the society pages of VF.
2548,2020-05-03 20:30:21,gcpn0a,"Love this post!  I'm so glad, especially for the last part.  It bothers me that Sonja and Dorinda are trying to make her out to be a liar just because she can live in luxury and buy what she wants to WITHOUT a man.  They're speaking from their own personal life experience.  Most people **don't** have access to unlimited wealth so maybe that's why they can't wrap their heads around the concept? Tinsley has a different life experience.  I don't know why they can't accept that."
2549,2020-05-03 22:59:23,gcpn0a,"Thanks for writing all of this out! I didn't really know the extent of her fame and status before. It actually makes me like her so much more because she doesn't name drop and brag like the other women do. I have always had a soft spot for Tins though, she just seems really sweet and fun, and also genuine. She puts all her issues out there for us to watch, and I enjoy that honesty. My only problem with her is that I think she just wears too much eye make up, like too many eyelashes, and I feel like I can't even really see her actual eyes sometimes. She looks great and her skin is amazing, she could probably do with a lot less makeup, but maybe that is just her style."
2550,2020-05-04 02:16:13,gcpn0a,"Idk if anyone else has commented this, but she also wrote a book! Southern Charm. It‚Äôs I guess loosely based on her life from that time period in New York post-Topper. I absolutely loved that book in college bc I was a southerner at a school in a big northern city.. it‚Äôs a fun and light read if you wanna learn more about Tinsley‚Äôs background from her perspective!"
2551,2020-05-04 05:04:49,gcpn0a,Wasn't particularly interested in this subject but I clicked anyway. You are such a good writer I ended up reading the entire thing. Had no idea how succesful she was. Great read. Thanks for doing the research!
2552,2020-05-04 19:29:35,gcpn0a,"Who remembers when she was rumored to have elbowed Olivia Palmero and Olivia sent a mass letter to all the socialites asking for them to accept her!

This article covers it!

2554,2020-05-03 19:56:18,gcpn0a,"Two of my cousins are friends with Tinsley Mortimer, they know her through some fashion industry people and I've been wanting them to introduce me for years now (they even named their dog after her) but I'm like too afraid to ask lol"
2555,2020-05-03 15:07:00,gcpn0a,I love this and it really helped me gain some perspective on Tins! Thank you üôå
2556,2020-05-03 15:28:33,gcpn0a,"This was great, thank you!"
2557,2020-05-03 16:13:19,gcpn0a,Aw I liked Timsley before but this made me like her even more. Thanks for sharing.
2558,2020-05-03 16:34:01,gcpn0a,I look forward to meeting her when I catch up.
2559,2020-05-03 18:32:39,gcpn0a,I wonder if she got a settlement in her divorce? I can imagine you would be set for life with that for sure.
2560,2020-05-03 19:31:51,gcpn0a,Thank you for this! I really enjoyed reading it and learning more about her. I wish we had write ups like this on everyone
2561,2020-05-03 19:36:05,gcpn0a,Tins is surprisingly humble given all of the famous people she's rubbed elbows with. I wish they could have given her a worthy foe-- like Olivia Palermo herself.
2562,2020-05-03 19:43:18,gcpn0a,"The Gigi Luann mentioned was Gigi Hadid. Not exactly a nobody, but not royalty either. :)"

2564,2020-05-03 20:01:45,gcpn0a,"You did the Lord's work with this post, OP! Good job! <3"
2565,2020-05-03 20:14:53,gcpn0a,Thank you for writing this up! I remember reading in some fashion magazine in the 2000‚Äôs that Tinsley was the real deal when it came to being a socialite instead of Paris Hilton. I felt like I was ‚Äúin the know‚Äù from reading that article.
2566,2020-05-03 20:25:31,gcpn0a,Thanks for that run down!  I find her adorable and funny.  She keeps the show fresh IMHO.
2567,2020-05-03 20:44:00,gcpn0a,This post is brilliant. Thank you
2568,2020-05-03 20:58:14,gcpn0a,"I love the effort you put into this OP. I feel like I understand her a whole lot better. I have always liked her, but couldn‚Äôt put my finger on her exactly. This post is amazing and I wish I could read it for the first time all over again. You‚Äôre doing the Lord‚Äôs work."
2569,2020-05-03 21:09:20,gcpn0a,Ahhhh mind blown a little :D Thanks for the educational material!
2570,2020-05-03 21:28:44,gcpn0a,"I was going to make a post just like this but I got lazy while writing it and just stopped. I loved Tinsley during this time. My family owned a chain of super markets and I was a receptionist for the business. Every day I'd clock in, go to the store and buy The New York Post. I bought a copy every day just so I could read Page Six the gossip column because Tinsley was in it every day. I couldn't wait to see what she was photographed in or read where she went. I was obsessed with her. I remember when she got her own show on the CW and what a big deal it was that they hired actresses to play her friends because her actual socialite friends wanted no part of it. I remember when she got divorced. I thought her and Topper would last forever but Page Six wrote about his family not liking that she went out every night. I loved this post OP! It's better than I would have done."
2571,2020-05-03 21:39:01,gcpn0a,"All this time I‚Äôve been watching & knowing that I ‚Äòknew‚Äô who Timsley was not really connecting how or why I did. Then between last night, reading up on Andre Leon Talley‚Äôs new book and seeing names like Meredith Melling and Plum Skyes, and then your post today and you mentioning Lauren Santo Domingo‚Äôs wedding and it‚Äôs all come screaming back to me. 
I am Brit but I devoured US Vogue in the early 2000s. Tinsley was all over it and she must have been etched far back in my sub conscious.....thanks for bringing it all back to me.  I might have to dig out some of the old issues I kept and take a walk down memory lane!"
2572,2020-05-04 01:05:42,gcpn0a,I truly do adore her and actually do find myself relating incredibly well to her üíõ She‚Äôs a gem and I‚Äôm thrilled to see her swan song be a sweet symphony ‚≠êÔ∏è
2573,2020-05-04 01:52:32,gcpn0a,This post made me like her.
2574,2020-05-04 02:30:42,gcpn0a,"This is so interesting! I didn‚Äôt know any of this about Tinsley‚Äôs background. And I used to keep up with it girls during that period and knew everything there is to know about them. But I guess it makes sense that I didn‚Äôt know Tins because you mentioned that she was more someone who was in the Manhattan social scene rather than pop-culture like Paris.

Thank you. Wow. I am OBSESSED."
2575,2020-05-04 02:39:27,gcpn0a,"Wow! This makes me wish they had pushed a story line for her. She is truly a whole show, not tardy for the plfffffffff or whatever the spinoff of the day is."
2576,2020-05-04 02:58:25,gcpn0a,"Thank you for that! Great read! I think the other ladies probably know a bit of this and are just jealous, which is why they're so mean. I love Tins! She has heart!"
2577,2020-05-04 04:40:00,gcpn0a,So at what point did Tinsley get cancelled by NY high society? Was it the reality show or what happened in Florida?
2578,2020-05-04 06:45:53,gcpn0a,"Tinsley and Topper also eloped when they were 18, and their families freaked out‚ÄîI think Topper‚Äôs grandfather flew him somewhere to have a quickie annulment? So clearly they were in love... she wasn‚Äôt a trophy wife!

Tinsley also played tennis and spent a year in Florida training at Nick Bollettieri‚Äôs famous tennis academy, where pros would get their start. She then played college tennis at Columbia."
2579,2020-05-04 08:00:48,gcpn0a,Yaayyy I‚Äôm so happy you made this post!! I‚Äôm glad the masses are now privy to what a queen Tins is üëè
2580,2020-06-16 19:50:51,gcpn0a,"I think Tinsley is beautiful, sweet and smart. That being said ‚Äî unearned wealth does not bestow on someone genuine social value. These socialites might raise money by hosting $25G-a-plate functions but they‚Äôd never survive in the real 99% world. Yes I love my Housewives but I can‚Äôt suspend disbelief so much that I think studying fashion or being surrounded by paparazzi is in any way important or adds anything to our culture. (Should have warned that this is a soapbox üòä)I always think of the server in Trading Places who rolls his eyes when he thanks ‚ÄúMr. Mort-i-mer‚Äù for the $5 Christmas bonus. These people make for excellent trash TV but IMO they‚Äôre one of the reasons we‚Äôre headed the way of ancient Rome. Sermon over! Now let‚Äôs get back to the fireworks in Newport...  Sorry if I inadvertently offended anyone here."
2581,2020-05-03 12:47:15,gcpn0a,"Devils advocate because I Stan a thorough deep dive, but Tinsley to my recollection was roundly mocked in the 00s as being the thirstiest wannabe Paris Hilton and paid her way into the exclusive invites that you mentioned. She was not cool, or chic, or a legitimate model and was seen as being kind of a poser. She was trying to force feed being an it girl and it only worked so much as her money youth and thinness would take her."
2582,2020-05-03 21:51:39,gcpn0a,I remember her in Gossip Girl! I‚Äôve never watched Housewives but she sounds really cool! Also btw you still need a invite to the Met Gala! Anna Wintour decides who gets in :)
2583,2020-05-03 14:38:49,gcpn0a,"She definitely grew up rich but just FYI her dad owned a rug store. Probably not the pedigree the Mortimer‚Äôs wanted for a DIL.  A lot of this talk about being descendants of Jefferson comes from her dad who liked to bend the elbow.

She and topper first eloped in high school and got their marriage annulled."
2584,2020-05-03 18:42:34,gcpn0a,"I like her that‚Äôs why my heart hurts for her and Scott. I feel that she can find someone who can treat her way better than he does. And at least not use her for his coupon cabin promos. Not to mention lead her on breaking on and off, without even putting a ring on it or something. She‚Äôs being strung along and used by Scott. And I‚Äôm not here for it"
2585,2020-05-03 20:23:35,gcpn0a,Thanks. Very interesting to know more of her back story. Although I think Tinsley seems very sweet I have a hard time respecting a 40 (?) year old woman who still allows her mother to control her. It‚Äôs sad.
2586,2020-05-03 20:20:07,gcpn0a,I‚Äôve been following tinsley a long time including her pre housewives palm beach days and TBH I do not believe that she is sitting on a huge pile of money of her own. Her dad blew through their family money
2587,2020-05-03 17:18:55,gcpn0a,"We know Tinsley was the shit over 10 years ago.  But she's a lot like Sonja, in that she (and her mother) lives in the past and needs to remind everyone she *used to be* the shit.  Maybe if she would stop being who she *used to be* she could move on with her life, and be who she *could be*."
2588,2020-05-03 18:28:20,gcpn0a,Do you mean notorious? That is not a good term.
2589,2020-05-09 05:07:55,gcpn0a,"  So I wrote this post to give some insight of how big Tinsley really was in the 2000‚Äôs, not only in the press but also her social circle, which consisted of the upper elites of Manhattan."
2590,2020-05-09 20:17:17,gcpn0a,"I remember hearing about tinsley way back in the early to mid 2000‚Äôs and I thought she sounded so cool and I totally wanted to be like even though I was in my late teens! 

Never knew any of the other women though until I watched the show."
2591,2020-07-28 02:12:48,gcpn0a,"Tinsley was my favorite, too.  She was smart, quick and witty.  Hope she‚Äôs gone on to find happiness."
2592,2020-05-03 19:26:52,gcpn0a,This is great! Thank you OP. I love posts such as these.
2593,2020-05-03 12:58:43,gcpn0a,"I have 10 mins left in last weeks RHONY but I remember Leah mentioning wanting to be or know Tinsley when Tinsley was in her prime... especially when Tins was coming down the run way.

Thanks for this post because I had no idea Tinsley was this popular or wannabe popular, especially the mid-2000s. I mean I graduated HS in 2007 and I‚Äôm from the Midwest so what do I know?? But I know who Paris Hilton is and obviously read Tiger Beat and all that stuff but had never heard of Tinsley before RHONY.

I like her on the show, although her style is very outdated, she‚Äôs a bit too old to still be wearing all the hot pink, crimped hair... although I still rock hot pink nail polish... she‚Äôs very clearly still living thru the 2000s which is interesting, kind of how the OC ladies (Tamra, Vicki) haven‚Äôt given up the bleach blonde, bejazzeled jeans and trucker hats. I actually follow someone on IG that was trying to resell her rock and republic? bejazzeled butt jeans for $100+. Yikessss."
2594,2020-05-07 02:09:12,gcpn0a,Why did I get a notification about this garbage?
2595,2020-05-03 20:09:55,gcpn0a,"I read ‚Äúshe grew up extremely privileged‚Äù and stopped there. Not holding it against her, I just prefer the housewives who had to work a little harder to get to where they are. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I love her and her personality but to praise her for her privileges isn‚Äôt my cup of tea."
2596,2020-05-03 16:19:04,gcpn0a,"She‚Äôs loaded because her rent is 9K in NYC? Sorry, but for a ‚Äúloaded‚Äù person that‚Äôs actually not a whole lot."
2597,2020-05-03 15:05:36,gcpn0a,She‚Äôs the anti 25k sunglasses
2598,2020-05-03 20:16:38,gcpn0a,"Yes! That‚Äôs what makes me really like her! She could easily be a spoiled, rude brat but she‚Äôs always been kind and polite on the show. She‚Äôs stood up for herself but she hasn‚Äôt done it in a way that brings the other women down."
2599,2020-05-03 15:44:53,gcpn0a,Money talks. Wealth whispers.
2600,2020-05-03 18:53:38,gcpn0a,She is so humble and never says anything mean about anyone
2601,2020-05-03 21:25:28,gcpn0a,"Money talks, wealth whispers."
2602,2020-05-03 15:54:29,gcpn0a,"Exactly. As Sonja said ‚Äúmoney talks, wealth whispers‚Äù. Or.... something like that."
2603,2020-05-04 03:41:17,gcpn0a,"As the great Dorinda Medley said ‚Äúmoney talks,but wealth whispers‚Äù"
2604,2020-05-04 00:07:52,gcpn0a,"Money talks, wealth whispers."
2605,2020-05-03 15:54:01,gcpn0a,"I remember Tinsley trying to say JUST THAT at the latest reunion, that she was taught to not talk about money, and the others were having none of it. And it infuriated me, 'cause to me it was pretty understandable... And I'm poor lol.


I don't care where her money is coming from, I love her still because she is kind and funny and a good person. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
2606,2020-05-03 16:19:03,gcpn0a,"It‚Äôs so true. I went to a fancy university and the people who were beyond-comprehension wealthy were generally pretty grounded and nice people. The people who had a ‚Äúlittle‚Äù were constantly trying to prove themselves and it was cringeworthy. Tinsley has nothing to prove, so she‚Äôs relaxed about who she is."
2607,2020-05-03 18:50:17,gcpn0a,"Agreed, but given that Sonja used to be in the same circles through her Morgan marriage (and Dale references their friendship), you would think she knows this but she goes out of her way to perpetuate Dorinda's half-baked theories. It must grate on her to know she lost her Morgan lifestyle after her divorce while Tinsley still has a worry-free lifestyle when it comes to spending and finances."
2608,2020-05-03 23:09:17,gcpn0a,"Yeah I mean even I was taught that it is SUPER rude and cringey to talk about money and where it comes from, and I grew up upper-middle class in the Ozarks. Like on par with asking what your weight is or something else completely personal. I totally empathized with her there, it would make me soooo uncomfortable for all my friends to constantly be asking where I got the money to buy my things or rent my place. And then to literally get upset and cause a fight when I tell them its none of their business? Their obsession with her finances is SO WEIRD."
2609,2020-05-03 21:52:34,gcpn0a,"Exactly, old money doesn‚Äôt brag."
2610,2020-05-03 20:13:27,gcpn0a,"I wonder if she has so much money, that she doesn‚Äôt even know how much."
2611,2020-05-20 11:38:48,gcpn0a,"Yes, the ultra wealthy don't talk about their wealth - it's classless and tactless, but it also makes one vulnerable to display exorbitant amounts of wealth."
2612,2020-05-03 13:01:35,gcpn0a,"Exactly! Seems like most of the ladies already have that ‚Äúpretty airhead‚Äù stereotype of Tinsley in their head, so whatever she says must not have any significance. 
Sonja is also not one to talk considering that Tinsley gifted her a $5000 giftcard AND a Louis Vuitton bag and Sonja herself knows exactly where Tinsley‚Äôs money comes from, and that is NOT Scott."
2613,2020-05-03 14:29:40,gcpn0a,Like the last episode when Tinsley was trying to share about her controlling mother and Dorinda pretended to dig her brain out üôÑ  As the one person giving Tinsley shit for not sharing she looked like the biggest asshole
2614,2020-05-03 20:00:17,gcpn0a,"I was disgusted when they were saying that stuff about Tinsley. Like literally calling her a hooker because she hung out with her ex-boyfriend and went on a trip with him. I wish I can have a relationship with my ex's where we could be cordial to each other if we see each other in public let alone go away on vacation. And she made the most valid point when she said to them, ""I don't have children so that's what I spend my money on, me"". Yeah it makes 100% perfect sense Dorinda, if you don't have somebody else you can spend your money on yourself really nothing wrong with that

The jealousy that seethes out of Dorinda and Sonja because of Tinsley's just normal everyday existence is palpable through the fucking television"
2615,2020-05-03 23:02:08,gcpn0a,"That's so true! Even in the most recent episode, she was trying to talk about how controlling her mother was using the example of the curly v. straight hair fight, and Dorinda and Leah just completely brushed her off.  They were laughing and making jokes like three feet from her. So rude. I wouldn't open up to these women either."
2616,2020-05-03 13:27:52,gcpn0a,God that show was aaammmmaaaazing!!!!
2617,2020-05-03 20:21:11,gcpn0a,"Yes the only thing lacking from your very well researched and written post is the truth about Topper. He was a complete nightmare from the beginning. The reason she was always out was to get away from him. Her personal family wealth is nothing special, at least compared to his and many wondered (knew) she would not be with him if it weren‚Äôt for the name and cash."
2618,2020-05-03 20:07:37,gcpn0a,"Oh man tFS, I snuck an invitation bc I was [livejournal] friends with a legit photog back when only ~industry insiders were allowed. The model gossip was always amazing"
2619,2020-05-04 00:16:40,gcpn0a,OMG TFS!!!!
2620,2020-05-03 15:48:07,gcpn0a,">was incredibly violent,

Wasn't she stalking that billionaire ex too?  Like he dumped her and she kept trying to break into his property?  That whole story is REALLY weird and incrediby sad, and I say that as a huge tinsley stan

edit -- people should read the news articles about this"
2621,2020-05-03 19:58:59,gcpn0a,"Of course, the experience of it was...somewhat different."
2622,2020-05-05 15:03:42,gcpn0a,Titanic reference in your first sentence??
2623,2020-05-03 14:02:44,gcpn0a,Yeah its dumb how Dorinda in her recap videos still dismiss Tinsley. She just focuses on the superficial aspect of what Tinsley is saying (curly hair vs straight hair) and not listening for the mother/daughter conflict she is talking about.
2624,2020-05-03 14:10:31,gcpn0a,Dorinda is definitely not the one to talk when she stays with a dry cleaning pig.. especially after BOTH Ramona and B tell her on national television that John is trash she still stays with him. Usually when housewives start attacking other people‚Äôs finances it means that they themselves are in trouble...
2625,2020-05-04 00:11:45,gcpn0a,I wonder if dorindas $ is actually running out. She is working SO SO hard on ig to sell her stupid ‚Äúmake it nice‚Äù shit
2626,2020-05-03 15:55:44,gcpn0a,This is exactly what I think.
2627,2020-05-04 01:00:26,gcpn0a,"That is how I feel too. Dorinda probably has a lot of financial things to manage, deal with, or worry about. This poor gal just re-did a modest kitchen (replacing pipes too!) and holy balls, I‚Äôm stressed, and I have a husband. The day our wonderful contractor called to say our pipes were ‚Äúweeping‚Äù I was weeping...and I have a very modest home....and we have 2 people working. Dorindas lifestyle isn‚Äôt crazy like some of the ladies, but I bet the manor is a PITA...she‚Äôs a tough broad and I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôs in the know about finances, but I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôs bitter at what looks like Tinsleys life. I hate that they all question if she wants a baby. They can all feck right off. Just support her."
2628,2020-05-04 02:34:57,gcpn0a,This is exactly what I think. And I think it‚Äôs so obvious that it must be true lol
2629,2020-05-04 03:59:19,gcpn0a,no wonder she keeps re-selling stuff
2630,2020-05-03 12:57:43,gcpn0a,Yes that was a failed attempt to keep being in the spotlight after her divorce. That show was really humiliating compared to her most glamorous days.
2631,2020-05-03 19:11:38,gcpn0a,IIRC she‚Äôs actually in an episode of gossip girl as well
2632,2020-05-03 20:37:52,gcpn0a,Omg I remember that show. It was so cringe. Do you remember her friend on that show who supposedly didn‚Äôt like black people and them removed from her sight in a bar?
2633,2020-05-03 20:46:53,gcpn0a,"This show is so bad, it‚Äôs so embarrassing..."
2634,2020-05-03 13:37:53,gcpn0a,"This is why I never understood why they thought her and Scott had an ‚Äúarrangement.‚Äù She has generational wealth and still worked prior to being with the physical abusive ex. What more, she never denied her parents were loaded."
2635,2020-05-03 14:32:40,gcpn0a,"Tinsley and Dale are both on the deed for the Palm Beach condo. They bought it in 2010 for $2.2 million and it‚Äôs probably worth $3 million now. If Tinsley got a divorce settlement in 2009 from Topper she would have likely made investments in 2010. So, Luann saying that she lives in Dale‚Äôs place is wrong. Also, they live in a very nice building on the ocean. Lu was staying in Tom‚Äôs condo in West Palm miles away and bragging like they‚Äôre even the same thing. Not at all! LOL"
2636,2020-05-03 14:15:14,gcpn0a,"I‚Äôve never understood why the hell people like Sonja and Dorinda question her money. Especially since she‚Äôs connected to both the Mercer and Mortimer names... like, there‚Äôs money, and then there‚Äôs Mercer/Mortimer money."
2637,2020-05-03 22:56:06,gcpn0a,"Besides, I believe the hotel she stays in gives her the room gratis because of the promotion the show brings! Not that out of left field."
2638,2020-05-05 03:23:25,gcpn0a,"Plus I‚Äôm sure she makes a decent chunk of change from RHONY too. I really wish they‚Äôd do a Chicago wives spinoff with her as the lead. I need Mrs Scott Kluth Tinsley. I‚Äôd like to see Tinsley in Chicago living her best life, and maybe defrosting those eggs."
2639,2020-05-04 03:43:53,gcpn0a,She writes them or Scott writes them?
2640,2020-05-03 14:38:17,gcpn0a,"That‚Äôs true. Bethenny wants to come off like she doesn‚Äôt need RHONY. Really, she doesn‚Äôt financially, but egotistically, B needs the show. Tinsley truly doesn‚Äôt need it in any sense of the word. She is stepping away and will be just fine without it."
2641,2020-05-03 16:01:21,gcpn0a,"I really felt like in the last two seasons of Bethenny she was jealous of Tinsley. First basically calling her vapid and superficial when she and Carole got close, and then her snide comments about Tins not having a daughter and being blonde (?!?) then the digs at the reunion. It seemed so odd because Tinsley has only ever been nice to Bethenny.

Edit: spelling"
2642,2020-05-03 17:33:37,gcpn0a,"Bethany literally said she was jealous. 

During one of the trips, Scott sent Tinsley a bracelet. B walked in to breakfast, saw the gift, turned around and walked back out. Explained later, ""yeah, I was jealous"".

Tinsley is **that girl**; she's super-rich already, but she's also showered with lavish gifts. Hell, I'm jealous."
2643,2020-05-03 16:47:40,gcpn0a,Bethenny was seethingly jealous of Tinsley it was very obviously
2644,2020-05-03 15:45:45,gcpn0a,"Sonja was a former hostess that got lucky. She blew it all by ignoring her sick husband for a party in Europe (?) which, unfortunately, caused her shitty friend to swoop in and heal/steal her husband in plain sight. With the exception of RHONY, it's been downhill since. The End."
2645,2020-05-03 13:27:06,gcpn0a,Yes!!! Will someone do one of these for each of the New York ladies! I also want to know more about Dorinda since she had the nerve to tell Tinsley at least she didn‚Äôt have to lie on her back to get her fancy shoes i want to know how she got all her money!
2646,2020-05-05 00:39:10,gcpn0a,">She was an ‚Äúit‚Äù girl whose style was emulated by one of the characters on Gossip Girl

Not only was her style emulated on Gossip Girl, she actually was on an episode of Gossip Girl."
2647,2020-05-03 13:48:31,gcpn0a,"I would love to but Tinsley is really the only one who had a very public life that every women on the UES envied, so there was much to write about. If you think about it, the NY housewives all had such fascinating and interesting background/lives. Morgan, Mortimer, Radziwill/Kennedy etc, those are all old-moneyed families with very interesting history in New York."
2648,2020-05-03 15:13:07,gcpn0a,"Wow, that is a really sad article. Did Tinsley see that her husband and his family looked down what she did? I can‚Äôt believe Topper said what he did in that article! When did they divorce? Bc it looks like the writing was on the wall at that point."
2649,2020-05-03 14:49:49,gcpn0a,This was such a great read!!
2650,2020-05-03 17:29:40,gcpn0a,"Seeing the photo in this article, it's obvious why Dale likes Tinsley's hair straight, not ""curly"", like she was talking about in last week's RHONY...the perfect Barbie doll. A lot of graphic psychological complexity here."
2651,2020-05-03 19:02:02,gcpn0a,This article could have its own thread. She is very interesting ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù for sure.
2652,2020-05-03 20:22:38,gcpn0a,From everyone I‚Äôve known who met tinsley (worked in palm beach for years so a lot) she‚Äôs the opposite of charming. Always very drunk and offering up way too much about her personal life. Not mean or rude... but sloppy
2653,2020-05-03 15:41:16,gcpn0a,"Exactly! Tinsley and Tooper first got married in HS and had it annulled under pressure from his family, only to be remarried a few years later. There were rumors that her family faked their prestige and were actually in the carpet business, which Tinsley has vociferously denied. Lastly it was a pretty open secret that Topper really didn't respect her and cheated on her frequently while they were married. Here's a [link](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/21/fashion/21topper.html) to a Times article that addresses all of this minus the cheating."
2654,2020-05-03 15:34:37,gcpn0a,"Totally agree with this.  Also, she was so all in with Topper that the end of that relationship really messed with her.  They first eloped when Tinsley was 18, I think while boarding school was still in session or had just ended.  Their parents made them annul the marriage, but they still stayed together and then did the big white wedding I‚Äôm sure Dale needed them to have. So to be that committed for so long to one person and then have them pull the rug out from under you, it must have been devastating."
2655,2020-05-03 16:03:28,gcpn0a,"There might also be something in there about her desire to have kids & not having had them with Topper. With the families they each come from, I‚Äôm sure they expected her to be a mom of two by the time she was celebrating her 30th birthday, and we know that didn‚Äôt happen (without any judgement about why. As has been laid out, she clearly wanted to make something of herself, and waiting to have kids is super normal). Based on what she‚Äôs shared about her split from Topper, I have to wonder if there was a timeline for her to have kids that she ended up not meeting, possibly unknowingly, and that‚Äôs why the kids issue hurts her so deeply. 

If you‚Äôre interested, she does talk about it a bit on High Society, and Dale‚Äôs reactions to her divorce put the Dale issue in a whole new light. I came out of High Society being a much bigger fan of Tinsley than when I started (and I already liked her!)"
2656,2020-05-03 16:10:36,gcpn0a,"I don‚Äôt think people realize exactly how badly Tinsley misplayed her hand when she was married to Topper. Her fame wasn‚Äôt coincidental, she hired a society girl publicist who helped her explode.  But as much as Tinsley was at the top of Socialite List, to Topper‚Äôs mother and grandmother‚Äôs generation of society grand dames, Tinsley was incredibly gauche.  And Topper felt the same way.  

Also, they may have initially married young, but their second wedding was like 7-8 years later, they didn‚Äôt jump back into it."
2657,2020-05-03 15:33:02,gcpn0a,"> but it has been mentioned that Topper could have been emotionally (it was he that called her boobs ugly or something like that, for example).

Topper wasn't the one that said that. It was the ex in Palm."
2658,2020-05-03 14:44:43,gcpn0a,"I think if she stayed in the same circles and continued her work as a socialite she definitely had a shot at staying prominent in NY. Her downfall really started with that reality show and then the Palm Beach arrest. NYC elites are not that forgiving, especially since she isn‚Äôt a part of the Mortimer family anymore so there would be no reason to give her any social status after her downfall."
2659,2020-05-03 19:31:42,gcpn0a,The reality show got her dropped from a lot of lists.  It was that bad.  She didn‚Äôt head to FL until several years after her divorce.
2660,2020-05-04 17:54:09,gcpn0a,"I think a lot of it has to do with how much her reputation was tarnished after her divorce and Florida arrest.  It‚Äôs very binary - she is not at the very top now, so she must therefore be at the very bottom.  Which isn‚Äôt the case."
2661,2020-05-03 13:38:38,gcpn0a,"The Mortimers, although very well-known and respected, are very low key about their lives and it is not known what they do now for a living, we only know that Topper is into hedge funds. Since she and Topper were highschool sweethearts and still have a good relationship after the divorce, I‚Äôd say it would be a scenario that could go both ways. Although I think Dale most certainly would make sure Tins got a few millions out of the divorce lol."
2662,2020-05-03 16:14:03,gcpn0a,"There‚Äôs a decent mention of her finances, including her divorce, near the end of ep 113 of the Andy‚Äôs Girls podcast (sorry for no time stamp, will edit if I can remember to listen through!) While not from the horse‚Äôs mouth, it‚Äôs a knowledgeable analysis of publicly available info!

2663,2020-05-04 23:08:26,gcpn0a,It could be both. Some prenups are generous.
2664,2020-05-03 13:41:06,gcpn0a,"Remember last season when she was sobbing over how miserable she was? Yes money can get you a lot to a certain extent but once you have a roof over your head and food in the fridge it doesn‚Äôt add that much, Tinsley is a really lonely person unfortunately."
2665,2020-05-03 15:54:11,gcpn0a,"I love love love Tinsley but apparently she's an alcoholic trainwreck behind the scenes and basically humiliated herself to get a womanizing dork middling rich dude like Scott to stick around. She was also arrested for stalking her violent psycho abusive ex after he dumped her.  I believe she is or was rich and remember when she super-elite  toast og the town, but I also doubt some aspects of the OP, which reads like a PR puff piece, esp about her supposed continued wealth. I'll pass on having her life."
2666,2020-05-03 13:22:44,gcpn0a,"Does she want children though? Kind of got the feeling she didn‚Äôt when her and Leah were discussing that guy tins was dating who already had 2-3 kids with 2 ex wives or something.

Granted, I‚Äôm not blaming anyone for not wanting to raise another person‚Äôs kids, she just seemed very disinterested in kids. Could‚Äôve just been that he wasn‚Äôt giving her the attention she wants/needs since he already had so much going on in terms of family. 

Unfortunately, I think at her age, finding a man that doesn‚Äôt already have kids is going to be hard."
2667,2020-05-03 15:14:33,gcpn0a,OMG Bergdorf Blondes?! There was literally a character named Tinsley and was written by Plum Skyes. She and Tinsley were working for Vogue around the same time.
2668,2020-05-04 03:55:33,gcpn0a,"I agree this sums it up so well! 

I think a lot of younger viewers think ‚ÄúTinsley got to make a cameo on GG‚Äù and that is not accurate. It‚Äôs more accurate to say that the entire show (GG) was a fictionalized version of Tinsley‚Äôs REAL life."
2669,2020-05-03 22:42:01,gcpn0a,"It was amazing, thank you! I wonder who is the equivalent of Tinsley in NY society these days?"
2670,2020-05-03 23:12:17,gcpn0a,Give us more!!
2671,2020-05-04 10:44:16,gcpn0a,Tins is too well mannered to go all in on Dorinda.  Me? I‚Äôd be scared. Dorinda has gotten so mean
2672,2020-05-03 18:01:08,gcpn0a,Totally. She also played collegiate tennis for Columbia!
2673,2020-05-04 08:16:34,gcpn0a,"Have you read the article about Socialite Rank? Here‚Äôs a few:

I also never understood what she sees in Scott, even current Tinsley post glory days could get any men on her knees that she wants in Manhattan/Palm Beach. I guess love is truly blind.."

2677,2020-05-03 17:30:37,gcpn0a,IIRC Olivia came from Whitney port‚Äôs hills spinoff ‚Äúthe city‚Äù and after the show is where I think her high society notoriety started. I could be wrong but that‚Äôs when I started hearing about her and is around the same timeline  ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

2679,2020-05-03 14:48:01,gcpn0a,It did not age well. Her first episode she compliments Weinstein.

2681,2020-05-04 10:39:26,gcpn0a,Wow! Even if they don‚Äôt introduce you to her please ask how she is in real life! I think we all now she is still very nice and genuine but I‚Äôd still like to more about her off the show.
2682,2020-05-03 12:56:13,gcpn0a,"Interesting! I never heard that about her paying her way in. She totally was fame hungry though, appearing at every social event. 
But a Southern Belle with the Mortimer last name was more than enough for her to get into the social scene and make her a legitimate socialite.  I honestly don‚Äôt think she was that Paris wannabe, the Mortimers were much more respected in high society than any New York family, so I wouldn‚Äôt think that Tinsley was a poser or had to ‚Äúpay her way in‚Äù to the social scene when she literally married into the upper elites of Manhattan."
2683,2020-05-03 13:31:08,gcpn0a,"Also, growing up rich and buying your way through college does not make anyone smart, just rich.

Using your rich friends‚Äô connections to get jobs and party invites is how the world works for the rich. Just my 2c, as someone who never cared about socialites."
2684,2020-05-03 20:21:04,gcpn0a,You are correct. The revisionist tinsley history is funny
2685,2020-05-03 14:47:46,gcpn0a,"I know about the rug cleaning company but I don‚Äôt think it was her dad‚Äôs. She shared that her dad also had a trust and got mad when he didn‚Äôt inherit the family company. Also, a rug cleaning store isn‚Äôt that lucrative to still have a trust fund in your forties. Her mom and sister still live very affluent so I guess they must have had another ace up their sleeves to live like this."
2686,2020-05-03 21:00:12,gcpn0a,They‚Äôre engaged

2688,2020-05-03 20:25:45,gcpn0a,"Totally agree about her styling. Her makeup also seems outdated and ages her considerably,"

2699,2020-05-03 23:33:38,gcpn0a,"Yep, we do all right (but nowhere even in the same universe as Tinsley) and we teach our son not to talk about money.  Whenever he asks how much money I make, I just say ""enough that you don't need to worry about it.""  I don't want him to think that because we have decent incomes he can be a brat to other kids or brag about it.  My mom was the same way--I never knew how much she made but I knew that I was well taken care of.  It's so bizarre to me that the other women don't get that."

New money hasn't figured that out yet which is why so many people get conned trying to play the money game. They're more concerned with people thinking they have less, so they're constantly trying to prove they have more. I remember a guy in college who really, really, really wanted everyone to know how much money he had, to the point of leaving ATM receipts around. 

Admittedly, I remember thinking that his $12K bank account meant he was a bazillionaire! I was impressed."

2705,2020-05-03 14:42:33,gcpn0a,"Dorinda was too dense to realize that the issue was deeper than how Tinsley wore her hair that day. Imagine how frustrating it would be to be Tinsley's age and have your mother trying to control every aspect of your life (including how your wear your hair). In that type of life, wearing your hair curly is a huge win. Dorinda was just plain rude."
2706,2020-05-03 15:43:37,gcpn0a,"I would love for Dorinda to look back on this season and realize that she‚Äôs jealous of Tinsley‚Äôs lifestyle (but of course she won‚Äôt). Dorinda crying about how she has so much on her plate and has no one to take care of her makes it obvious that she resents that Tinsley seems to have it so easy. Dorinda doesn‚Äôt actually want to learn anything about Tinsley, because then she might have to have compassion for her, when all she really wants is someone to dump her shit on and not have to feel bad about it."
2707,2020-05-03 15:19:06,gcpn0a,Correction: Dorinda IS the biggest asshole.
2708,2020-05-03 21:14:41,gcpn0a,Dorinda is jealous that she doesn‚Äôt have anyone in her life who is tending to her
2709,2020-05-03 15:55:08,gcpn0a,"Her version was that she went there to get her stuff and the cops arrested her for trespassing, I think. It was a horrible relationship, one police report (there were several) stated that he once pushed her head against the sidewalk..."
2710,2020-05-05 15:03:52,gcpn0a,Bingo
2711,2020-05-03 14:59:40,gcpn0a,It bothered me that Leah was in that conversation with Dorinda when she‚Äôs supposed to be Tinsley‚Äôs friend. People seem to use Tinsley as a punching bag because she‚Äôs so gentle (but also so privileged). She‚Äôs an easy target. :(
2712,2020-05-04 17:12:10,gcpn0a,Exactly !!! It‚Äôs alarming that dale is so controlling of her hair?! Imagine the emotional abuse.
2713,2020-05-03 15:40:51,gcpn0a,"I will never understand her relationship with John. She doesn‚Äôt want to live with him, but than gets made if he doesn‚Äôt stay home alone at his house when she doesn‚Äôt want to attend an event???

Plus they are so not well matched- she just seems constantly annoyed with him. She purposely let him burn himself on a hot pan!!! That‚Äôs not nice.

And he is kinda gross in how he acts. I‚Äôm not even gonna pick on his looks or sweatiness because neither of those things would bother anyone if he was a good man. 

Honestly based on her behavior I think Dorinda has some low self esteem happening - maybe even depression and she doesn‚Äôt feel she‚Äôs worth anything better than John and that makes her more miserable so she takes it out in everyone else. Especially Tinsley. It‚Äôs exacerbated when she drinks."
2714,2020-05-03 16:20:44,gcpn0a,"Yessss!  They get this wild look in their eye!  Lol, thank you for this post, I LOVED it!"
2715,2020-05-04 11:10:54,gcpn0a,Watching the latest WWHL with Dorinda it seems like her and John are not together anymore...?   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVJZqOJyETQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVJZqOJyETQ)
2716,2020-05-04 06:03:08,gcpn0a,"I really don't think so. She became very wealthy and successful in Manhattan when she was single. She opened a cashmere company in London and made a ton of money off that with very high profile clientele - Princess Diana and Joan Collins among them, and married wealthy, twice, the latter of which left her everything when he died. She also makes like $250,000 per season of TRH. She outright owns her gigantic mansion in the Berkshires that was worth over 2 million in 2005 - on Zillow, the only comparable home 10,000+ sq ft with that acreage is listed at 7 million so we could say hers is worth 5 million as a guess, and similar apartments in Manhattan, in her neighborhood, run 2-3 million easy. All this to say I think she's doing well. Lol"

2718,2020-05-03 13:41:35,gcpn0a,"It's wild! NYC women should 100% understand where Tinsley's money comes from, because a good chunk of the elite is like that; quiet, consistent wealth. ü§¶"
2719,2020-05-03 15:29:45,gcpn0a,"Scott probably does spend lots of money on Tinsley, but that‚Äôs because he‚Äôs wealthy, not due to her lack of wealth. The other ladies need to point that out to make themselves feel inferior because reality is, they did all have to lay on their backs for money (a la Dorinda). None would be the status they are today if it wasn‚Äôt for marrying rich. With the exception Ramona, who coincidentally doesn‚Äôt talk about Tinsley‚Äôs financial situation."
2720,2020-05-03 15:58:00,gcpn0a,"I would imagine that she has enough that she could take care of herself, and maybe she wants to settle down with someone that can take care of her.  Who knows.  She has clearly chosen Scott, and it‚Äôs unkind to say it‚Äôs just a transaction."
2721,2020-05-03 15:53:12,gcpn0a,Not. At. All.
2722,2020-05-03 20:18:34,gcpn0a,"Tinsleys moms condo is in a decent building but a terrible location when it comes to palm beach standards. It‚Äôs on the beach but dead in the middle of town which means tourists around it all the time. The people with really big money mostly live on the intercostal side or about a mile away from their condo

The condo sits at one of the only public beach accesses in town so it‚Äôs constant traffic and noise and people taking pictures and shit"
2723,2020-05-03 14:20:11,gcpn0a,"Exactly! She was born into the 1% and then married into the 0,1%. We‚Äôre talking about a constitutional billionaire family not some random median-income household down the street."
2724,2020-05-03 15:34:13,gcpn0a,"Especially coming from Dorinda, who absolutely married money and was gifted Blue Stone Manor by Richard."
2725,2020-05-03 21:15:57,gcpn0a,"It's like, how can they not KNOW? I grew up on the other side of the country, but when I was young I was glued to society news in magazines such as Vanity Fair and Town & Country. I knew very well who Tinsley Mortimer was when she joined the franchise."
2726,2020-05-04 23:47:10,gcpn0a,I highly doubt that over a decade after their divorce Tinsley still has enough money leftover from any divorce settlement she got from Topper. They didn't have kids and I'm sure Topper's family would have made him get a prenup. If her mom having a $2 million condo as her biggest real estate asset shows anything...I don't see Tinsley getting anything more than a modest trust fund income...certainly not enough to pay for luxury hotels in Manhattan at thousands of dollars a month.
2727,2020-05-03 15:49:52,gcpn0a,">I‚Äôve never understood why ...people.. question her money 

there have been rumors she's broke, even I've heard them. that's probably why."
2728,2020-05-04 10:50:49,gcpn0a,She does. Way to miss the point of this post entirely!!
2729,2020-05-03 17:09:36,gcpn0a,Wasn't Tinsley also taking a super low salary for the show and never asked for a raise? It's also very telling that she hasn't launched businesses on the show either. Anyone else in her position would be creating a fragrance or a handbag line. She definitely doesn't need the money.
2730,2020-05-03 23:33:24,gcpn0a,"Bethenny would‚Äôve died to be in the circles Tinsley was in so that has a lot to do with it. I also recall her being pissed at Kelly (who know fount is crazy), that she kept seeing her out at events and Kelly never remembered her. Lol. Once Bethenny feels like she‚Äôs not being noticed, I‚Äôm sure that got under her skin."
2731,2020-05-03 19:14:46,gcpn0a,Fuckin around in the south of France! He married your friend!
2732,2020-05-03 13:41:04,gcpn0a,Don‚Äôt know much about Dorinda but she most certainly got rich because of her husbands. But even now I don‚Äôt think she could afford the jet setting-with Zimmermann outfits lifestyle like B and Tins.
2733,2020-05-05 01:27:39,gcpn0a,"Yes, exactly, and she never talks about it. Can you imagine if these things had happened to Sonja or Ramona? We‚Äôd never hear the end of it!"
2734,2020-05-03 14:37:26,gcpn0a,Did you watch Tinsley on Dr phil? It was during her divorce and Dale was team Topper. It was...painful to watch and when I first began to feel for Tinsley.
2735,2020-05-03 22:39:58,gcpn0a,Would you ever do a write up for any one of the other HW franchises?  I would love a deep dive into how Ken & LVP got their money
2736,2020-05-03 15:49:34,gcpn0a,Right?! I think this was about a year before they split üò¢
2737,2020-05-04 17:52:23,gcpn0a,"This was reportedly the issue that broke up Topper and Tinsley - he felt she was more interested in going out, being seen, and being famous.  It‚Äôs not exactly a shock that this came out this way, especially since the Mortimers were very old school NY society.  They divorced only like a year after the article."
2738,2020-05-03 21:35:30,gcpn0a,"Oh, that's disappointing to hear. 

I guess excessive alcohol can topple anybody."

It‚Äôs crazy when you think that Jill Zarins money is carpet selling money. It‚Äôs *tons* of money but it‚Äôs almost offensive to Tinsley that anyone would suggest that it‚Äôs on par with her family wealth."
2740,2020-05-04 22:58:47,gcpn0a,He sounds like he didn‚Äôt like her very much.
2741,2020-05-03 17:18:25,gcpn0a,Well then Topper‚Äôs family are a bunch of assholes. They should have been thrilled to welcome someone like Tinsley into their family. What idiots.
2742,2020-05-03 17:20:01,gcpn0a,"Are you sure? Because I do remember she talked about both exes in that scene, implying that they both agreed they‚Äôre too small and that‚Äôs why she‚Äôs insecure about them. Maybe they both made similar remarks."
2743,2020-05-03 19:33:21,gcpn0a,"The reality show got her dropped from a lot of lists, that and losing her status as a Mortimer meant that she didn‚Äôt exactly have the option of just doing her socialite thing."
2744,2020-05-03 16:23:16,gcpn0a,Didn‚Äôt she marry Topper twice?  I thought they snuck off the first time and his family threw a fit!
2745,2020-05-03 19:18:40,gcpn0a,Around 45 mins in ‚úåÔ∏è
2746,2020-05-03 14:04:37,gcpn0a,Very true. Just the glamour and never ever worrying about money sounds amazing. But the grass is always greener on the other side.
2747,2020-05-03 15:19:24,gcpn0a,"THIS! My knee-jerk reaction is to be super envious as well since I‚Äôd love to never have to worry about money again, but it‚Äôs very clear that she‚Äôs a pretty troubled person with some deep rooted issues that can lead to debilitating unhappiness. Honestly many of the wealthiest folks I‚Äôve known have been the most lonely, miserable, self destructive people. Money is great but it‚Äôs definitely not the key to happiness."
2748,2020-05-03 13:50:16,gcpn0a,I took from that conversation that she enjoyed the kids but maybe not the two ex wives. Not that they didn‚Äôt get along or like each other but that attention had to be split in so many ways. Also when they were away from all of that he would have his guy friends over and she didn‚Äôt get alone time.
2749,2020-05-03 13:58:31,gcpn0a,Have you seen the eggs episode? She has been very clear about wanting a baby
2750,2020-05-03 14:23:06,gcpn0a,I thought her saying that stuff to Leah was kind of a defense mechanism and a little joking for the camera.
2751,2020-05-03 13:34:28,gcpn0a,Does Scott have kids?
2752,2020-05-03 15:16:48,gcpn0a,Oh yes!! Maybe that is where I remember it from! I did read Bergdorf Blondes! I read all those ‚Äúnyc chick lit‚Äù novels in the 2000s. I thought I was going to have to go through the al one at a time!! Thank you!!
2753,2020-05-04 03:26:30,gcpn0a,"The world has changed. Social media changed everything. Like OP mentioned, if you‚Äôre going to try to make a comparison... Tinsley was on a level most comparable to the Kardashians, or maybe Gigi Hadid. But this was a lifetime ago. At the time, Kim Kardashian WORKED FOR Paris Hilton (as her assistant) and Tinsley was above them all. 

Now, for comparison, all that really matters is social media fame. The truly wealthy and the old school elite (including the UES crew) has mostly gone into hiding and tightened their close knit communities. 

Being wealthy used to be something most Americans aspired to and looked on in awe of. Now a days, most Americans resent and despise wealthy people. It‚Äôs such a different world, I‚Äôm not sure you can really make any comparisons."
2754,2020-05-03 15:05:05,gcpn0a,"Maybe she wants someone who truly loves her, not her image."
2755,2020-05-04 01:15:50,gcpn0a,"I think it‚Äôs probably that he‚Äôs so different from Topper and the other heirs to fortunes she‚Äôs dated? Scott built a business from the ground up and from what I understand didn‚Äôt grow up wealthy, so likely doesn‚Äôt share a lot of the attitudes her former partners did on the frequency of her going out, where her family money came from, being able to buy off cops to hide crimes against her etc. She has plenty of pressure from her own family and probably likes that someone like Scott wouldn‚Äôt be pushing those same kind of societal expectations on her too."
2756,2020-05-03 17:48:22,gcpn0a,"Yeah me too and I don't understand why she became so big all of the sudden, like there are more girls in NYC who were more eligible for that title"
2757,2020-05-04 17:14:44,gcpn0a,Apparently she is just the most fun loon job you will ever meet in your life and she's a really good time and basically exactly like she is on television except after everything that went down with the ex she's a little bit more demure I guess. They used to hang out with her when they were in their late 20s early 30s.
2758,2020-05-03 12:59:06,gcpn0a,"Totally fair. Just sharing my perspective from working in fashion and being out in the 00s, granted I was very much downtown and not uptown!"
2759,2020-05-03 14:42:31,gcpn0a,I never understood that people think you can buy your way through college. Sure you might buy your acceptance into college but you still have to do the work.
2760,2020-05-03 15:21:32,gcpn0a,"As a Richmonder, I can say Mercer Rugs is an iconic institution. Literally everyone had their rugs cleaned there. Homes here love an oriental rug and they made a pretty penny on their business."
2761,2020-05-03 20:44:10,gcpn0a,I got 9 DVs sooo guess we may be the only two that feel that way?
2762,2020-05-04 03:40:19,gcpn0a,I didn‚Äôt say I didn‚Äôt like her! She‚Äôs a housewife for a reason. Love the franchise and all the cast üòä
2763,2020-05-03 22:27:09,gcpn0a,"I truly like Tinsley, too. She‚Äôs pretty classy and down to earth."
2764,2020-05-04 01:30:22,gcpn0a,Me too! I have loved her being on. I felt bad people kept calling her boring. I think she‚Äôs fun and legit someone I could see hanging out with in real life!
2765,2020-05-04 01:35:30,gcpn0a,but bad behavior screams.
2766,2020-05-03 17:14:50,gcpn0a,Ah! Thank you!!! IRONIC
2767,2020-05-03 18:54:59,gcpn0a,I need to rewatch that ugh bethenny was so mean to her I feel like always licks on someone younger in fact has th err ever been a younger house wife she didn‚Äôt pick on
2768,2020-05-04 00:53:44,gcpn0a,"Absolutely don‚Äôt miss B AT ALL. Last weeks episode at Ramona‚Äôs house (I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm caught up?) was PEAK NY...and had nothing to do with the narcissistic, attention demanding B. Hell, I didn‚Äôt even think of her. Every lady brought it, and we didn‚Äôt have to suffer through B‚Äôs snide comments, crying,  punning, any of it!"
2769,2020-05-04 11:25:59,gcpn0a,"And I love that her explanation was ""I went to high school in Atlanta, that's in the South, I don't see that!"" Atlanta is an island of blue in a sea of red. It's like saying I know all about Kingston and Rhinebeck because I live in Manhattan. Okay, B."
2770,2020-05-04 04:55:36,gcpn0a,My parents told me when I asked if we were rich that ‚Äúthey‚Äù were rich and I was a benefactor. That was made even more clear when they cut me off at 19. I have less wealthy friends who are still depending on their parents. It all depends on how the parents discuss wealth with their kids.
2771,2020-05-03 22:33:30,gcpn0a,"Remember the drunken Hamptons? Leah: FUCK JP MORGAN!
Sonja: GIVE ME ANOTHER ONE, I'LL FUCK HIM!

I usually like Sonja but that statement said a lot about her mentality."
2772,2020-05-04 02:33:29,gcpn0a,"And also Sonja doesn‚Äôt really seem to still be financially in the same place as before, where as Tinsley is probably so loaded she‚Äôll be the same kind of rich for life. So that might make a difference too."
2773,2020-05-04 16:47:27,gcpn0a,"I'm from a slightly more southern part of the Ozarks than the show was set but I'm not gonna lie, it's actually a lot like that lol they did a good job. I used to go to the lake of the Ozarks every summer. Beautiful scenery but unfortunately a lot of drugs and poverty too. The people are simultaneously the nicest you'll ever meet and also scary af lol"
2774,2020-05-03 16:47:33,gcpn0a,Totally - also her and Luann(or possibly Ramona) were so dismissive claiming not tell their mommy‚Äôs anything - yet all of them are very involved in their adult children‚Äôs lives.......
2775,2020-05-03 15:32:01,gcpn0a,"And Tinsley literally prefaced that conversation by saying ""it's symbolic"". Like, come on, Dorinda."
2776,2020-05-03 18:52:16,gcpn0a,My mother is 100 percent dale way too involved and judge mental of my life I‚Äôm an only child so honestly my mom is probabaly worse I honestly couldn‚Äôt even hear her talk about that argument because it was giving me anxiety I have had this fight before! My mom gives me panic attacks whenever I want to go to the hair dresser because she doesn‚Äôt like my short bob... literally my heart is racing right now
2777,2020-05-03 17:18:41,gcpn0a,She was on WWHL last week and doubled down on her treatment of Tinsley. Basically said that it was a fourth wall issue where she thinks it‚Äôs not fair that Tinsley doesn‚Äôt reveal more of herself on the show because everyone else does. But when you think about it what do we really know about Dorinda? We know probably just as much about her that we do about Tinsley. Just because you drunkenly blurt out every nasty thought in your head doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre necessarily open about your life.
2778,2020-05-03 16:37:49,gcpn0a,"I think you nailed it. When Dorinda talks about Richard, among the many things I‚Äôm sure she loves about him, she mentions how he took care of her and Hannah. She enjoyed (understandably) the sense of security (financial and emotional) he provided. She looks at Tinsley as having that kind of security from Scott. Even when they are broken up, it seems like Tinsley still could reach out to him for emotional support if she needed to and I think that is what Dorinda is seething about to some extent. None of the other women have a partner to rely on. Tinsley seemed to have someone who she could have that with, even if they weren‚Äôt in a formal relationship. The stuff about him paying her bills is just easier to point out because it is easier to make Tinsley look bad if a man pays her bills than to make her look bad for having a man who might listen to her cry but I think it is actually the latter part that upsets Dorinda more."
2779,2020-05-03 16:57:19,gcpn0a,"His neighbor‚Äôs called the police when he threw her against the ground and smashed her head into the pavement. Another time the neighbors called after hearing her screaming to find her covered in lacerations on her arms and face. The problem in these instances is that both she and Nico were under the influence of booze and cocaine and the Fanjul‚Äôs basically own southern and central Florida, so no charges were brought. They view the PBPD as their personal patrol and when Tinsley went on his property after a fight to get her purse he came down on her with charges. Tinsley never called the cops on him or pressed charges when they found her instances where he was battering her. I could go on about the problems surrounding the Fanjuls, but Nico has serious drug and rage problems."
2780,2020-05-03 16:39:04,gcpn0a,"It is awful and shows DV is not a money or class issue. This is a larger issue of our society. *The* IT Girl with tons of money couldn‚Äôt even get out of such a violent relationship unscathed. I would love to see Tinsley talk more about how she got out, but I don‚Äôt think she is allowed to."
2781,2020-05-03 16:08:17,gcpn0a,Ah. How terrible.
2782,2020-05-03 15:20:18,gcpn0a,"I got the impression no one was listening to each other during that lunch. 

I am annoyed Dorinda watched the episode but still didn't pick up what Tinsley was trying to say."
2783,2020-05-04 16:39:56,gcpn0a,"I'm just gonna throw out a guess that maybe Leah isn't so great.

Edit: also wasn't Dorinda thinking about selling bluestone? It is a very large property to upkeep and even without the flooding it probably cost her a pretty penny in property taxes."
2784,2020-05-03 17:04:04,gcpn0a,"I don't get it either. The only thing that makes sense to me is that John was Dorinda's rock while she mourned the loss of Richard and she somehow feels like she owes it to John to stick with him now. I also think Dorinda still isn't over Richard's loss (I can't blame her, that would traumatize me forever) but John doesn't mind it, he knows his place and accepts whatever level of love Dorinda's able to give him."
2785,2020-05-04 10:38:09,gcpn0a,"I think that for Dorinda, John is different enough from Richard that he cannot replace him. John is ‚Äúsafe‚Äù in the sense that he will never come close to emotionally (and I guess financially) fulfilling her in a true companionship. John is basically a warm body for her physical needs with the bonus of free dry cleaning. It‚Äôs pretty clear she‚Äôs not in love with him. 

I think it terrifies her to find a man that she can truly fall in love with because it will feel like the ultimate betrayal to Richard. And/or, she feels like he was a once in a lifetime love and feels that she can‚Äôt/won‚Äôt ever find that again and resolves herself to being in an unhappy relationship with John."
2786,2020-05-05 03:14:56,gcpn0a,"There‚Äôs also a ton of speculation that he‚Äôs her dealer. I think, if that‚Äôs true, that‚Äôs a factor too."
2787,2020-05-03 14:45:32,gcpn0a,"Yeah, reality tv was much more low brow at the time, I remember being surprised that Tinsley would get involved in a reality show. And then I saw how horrible most of the other cast members were and I couldn‚Äôt believe she would willingly associate herself with those people."
2788,2020-05-03 15:54:12,gcpn0a,"It didn‚Äôt matter when that show came out, it was embarrassing.  You wouldn‚Äôt see any of Tinsley‚Äôs society contemporaries doing that (note Quincy Morgan‚Äôs absence from reality tv)"
2789,2020-05-03 14:03:02,gcpn0a,"I think Dorinda is trying to bait Tinsley into talking about the details of her trust fund, how much she gets every month, how much she has in the bank, etc. Maybe Dorinda thinks if the viewers knew how much money Tinsley receives without doing actual work they would like her less? She‚Äôs just coming across as bitter and jealous about it though."
2790,2020-05-03 13:58:41,gcpn0a,"I think it‚Äôs jealousy, but not just because she‚Äôll be wealthy all her life. It‚Äôs because despite even a mugshot, she has rebounded and found love and is still beloved in society. It might not be closing out idk Givenchy but it‚Äôs obvious she still maintained her friendships and she‚Äôs found herself in a happier place than before. She‚Äôs thriving!"
2791,2020-05-03 15:48:54,gcpn0a,"Good catch about Ramona. She has been very nice to Tinsley (because of her social standing I'm sure) and does not harp on her like the others. 

I think Carole didn't really care either. Or atleast never talked about it, on camera.

I'm also trying to remember if Luann ever did so either..."
2792,2020-05-03 20:27:39,gcpn0a,"$2.2 million is a starter apartment in Palm Beach. I said by comparison to Tom‚Äôs in WPB they were in a nicer location. Of course there are $70 million estates on PB and no one was saying Dale or Tinsley was spending that kind of money. Frankly, being in town by the shopping is 100% the lifestyle that many widows and divorcees prefer. Those buildings rarely have condos sitting on the market due to the demand. I wouldn‚Äôt say they are living low by anyone‚Äôs standards."
2793,2020-05-03 15:51:43,gcpn0a,"Interesting, I‚Äôve never heard of any."
2794,2020-05-04 23:09:05,gcpn0a,Is there any evidence that she donates to charity? With or without her own money?
2795,2020-05-03 19:54:19,gcpn0a,"Did they feature her eyelash line at some point? If they did, it must have been very brief. Regardless, I‚Äôm assuming an eyelash line is something of a passion project for her."
2796,2020-05-03 19:27:07,gcpn0a,Yeah pretty sure I‚Äôve read that she‚Äôs never asked for more money and or she is the lowest paid
2797,2020-05-03 14:14:38,gcpn0a,"Which is probably why Dorinda's the one pushing the ""arrangement"" narrative, that's what happened to her!"
2798,2020-05-03 14:15:21,gcpn0a,I think that's why she's so hateful... it has to be jealousy bc Tins has an easy life and real wealth. Tinsley is just too sweet and kind for it to be anything but jealousy.
2799,2020-05-03 19:38:26,gcpn0a,Dorinda had a successful cashmere business-- Princess Diana wore DCL.
2800,2020-05-03 15:07:30,gcpn0a,"That Dr. Phil was the first I had heard of Tinsley and I remember feeling terribly bad for her.  Then when she came onto RH I was like ""that is the sad girl from Dr. Phil!""  I had felt so bad for her that her appearance had stuck with me that long."
2801,2020-05-03 16:12:12,gcpn0a,"Good lord, why on earth would she have thought going on Dr Phil was a good idea?"
2802,2020-05-03 18:47:54,gcpn0a,Does anyone have a link to said episode?
2803,2020-05-04 20:18:43,gcpn0a,"Do you think Tinsley didn‚Äôt care about being divorced? Because if she did, she had enough warning and time to change her ways."
2804,2020-05-04 08:57:11,gcpn0a,Agreed. Having grown up among some of these people I can confirm that in at a certain social strata there is a huge prejudice against people that have to work for their fortune *gasp* rather than inheriting wealth and having vanity jobs like her ex-husband. Frankly the article seemed like Topper's attempt at noblesse oblige in explaining his disdain for Tinsley's celebrity.
2805,2020-05-04 23:59:39,gcpn0a,"Lollllllllll ""She arrived for an interview with a stack of press clippings and photographs of Graymont, the large house she grew up in.""

Wealth whispers?"
2806,2020-05-03 19:34:30,gcpn0a,"I didn‚Äôt mean them specifically - just the old NY society.  My point was more that Tinsley was queen of a certain part of NY society, but even then there were layers that she couldn‚Äôt penetrate.  Does that difference make sense?"
2807,2020-05-04 02:46:16,gcpn0a,Well the German count or prince or whoever she was with on High Society that her mother was chasing around spoke absolutely terribly to her.
2808,2020-05-03 19:42:01,gcpn0a,Yeah when they were in boarding school but then I think after college they did the big white wedding
2809,2020-05-04 01:44:15,gcpn0a,"Thank you! 

I can see my mistrust in my memory to come update was well placed üòÖ"
2810,2020-05-03 18:19:43,gcpn0a,"I have thought, ever since the eggs episode, that Tins should go ahead and have herself a baby. Andy and Anderson have done it, why not Tinsley? But, girl, move the heck away from Dale first!

She really should become a mother in her singledom and own it. I‚Äôm convinced she would be a good mother, she called 911 over her dog. She may lack common sense but she has a good, empathetic heart and can learn by asking for help."
2811,2020-05-03 13:36:33,gcpn0a,I don‚Äôt think so?
2812,2020-05-03 19:39:54,gcpn0a,Nope no Kluth kids
2813,2020-05-04 08:07:11,gcpn0a,"I would love a list of NYC chick lit novels, they‚Äôre my absolute favourites!"
2814,2020-05-04 08:11:24,gcpn0a,"Isn‚Äôt it funny how the uber-elite have gone into hiding instead of capitalising on the public‚Äôs interest? I would love to know more about the next generation of old school kids, like Sonja‚Äôs daughter Quincy and her friends. Their social lives aren‚Äôt reported on, their social media accounts are all private, charity events aren‚Äôt as splendorous or as publicised as they used to be... I kind of miss having that a glimpse into that wealthy lifestyle, it was so aspirational lol"
2815,2020-05-03 18:40:12,gcpn0a,I don‚Äôt think she was an it girl as far as like being a Serena vanderwoodsen uber high society It girl. But because of the show and social media taking off she because an enmass social media it girl because of her connection to elle and the fashion world. She was that bad bitch that got an internship and worked for a top magazine in nyc. She was aspirational to girls all over who wanted to be her when they grew up. Myself included üòÇ but aside from the City I didn‚Äôt keep up with her. I just know she was able to market herself really well and parlay it to a legit fashion/influencer/socialite ‚Äúcareer‚Äù since
2816,2020-05-03 18:00:28,gcpn0a,I totally agree. She also went to a prestigious boarding school and played collegiate tennis at Columbia. Girlfriend didn‚Äôt just skate her way through.
2817,2020-05-03 17:54:10,gcpn0a,I think the POTUS proves you wrong. One of his professors called him the dumbest human being he‚Äôd ever taught
2818,2020-05-03 15:26:17,gcpn0a,"Oh wow thank you, I didn‚Äôt know that! So how are the Mercers perceived in Richmond?"
2819,2020-05-03 22:49:46,gcpn0a,I think so. It surprises me. I thought it was widely accepted that her styling is pretty terrible for the most part.
2820,2020-05-04 04:37:17,gcpn0a,But trash screams
2821,2020-05-04 15:06:33,gcpn0a,"Yeah definitely.  I've made clear to my son that he will not be cut off at 18, but that he still doesn't need to know how much money we have.  I'm hoping he is able to get some scholarships but I told him we would help him with college and that, although we expect him to go out into the world and make something of himself, he'll always have a place to stay with us if needed.  I got cut off at 18 even though my parents made plenty of money and it sucked, lol."
2822,2020-05-03 22:53:41,gcpn0a,She married the bank!!
2823,2020-05-04 16:37:42,gcpn0a,I think maybe she was joking?  I just listened to an interview with her and she sounded way more self-aware than I had expected. She knows she's on a t.v show and she amps up her behavior on purpose.
2824,2020-05-04 17:28:01,gcpn0a,Ok but that retort was pure gold and something I bet B HOWLED at
2825,2020-05-03 17:41:56,gcpn0a,"So typically boomers. Not for thee, but for me."
2826,2020-05-03 20:35:14,gcpn0a,Excellent point!
2827,2020-05-03 19:39:45,gcpn0a,Yikes. Put your mom on an info diet stat!
2828,2020-05-03 20:55:09,gcpn0a,Hugs
2829,2020-05-03 17:57:44,gcpn0a,"Tinsley revealed she had frozen her dog last year after calling 911 to try to revive him, she has spoken about her abusive ex who called her breasts ‚Äúlittle uglies‚Äù, she was full blown ugly crying in doll make up that she is miserable, and she cried with her mom FaceTiming her frozen eggs. I‚Äôd say the Tinz lays most of it out there. 

I understand not revealing much about her and Scott. I‚Äôm a person where I don‚Äôt talk about my relationships until I‚Äôm extremely confident in them, I have this feeling that I‚Äôll jinx it if I talk about it and put it out in the universe. I think Tinsley not opening up about that is merely an emotional defense mechanism.

ETA: that I agree with everything you said above!"
2830,2020-05-03 20:41:37,gcpn0a,"Tinsley revealed her fucking raw emotions about not being able to have a kid when she planned and feeling like it is too late now in seasons past. She‚Äôs revealed her past relationship was abusive, and her mom is controlling. She‚Äôs revealed serious shit - it sounds like nothing will satisfy Dorinda üòí"
2831,2020-05-03 17:43:12,gcpn0a,Right? It just makes you an asshole.
2832,2020-05-03 20:37:33,gcpn0a,I like Dorinda a lot but I agree with this.  Dorinda's opinion and treatment of Tinsley is just irrational.
2833,2020-05-04 02:49:52,gcpn0a,"god dorinda is the QUEEN of doubling down instead of reflecting on her actions and trying to grow as a person. it's the most mind boggling thing! I'll never understand her ability to get schwasted, say stupid shit, and the next day double down on it, especially when it's at a reunion and she's had time to watch herself say these things word for word and think it over!  I have a love/hate relationship with her on the show because of this aspect of her personality. I just can't imagine being friends with someone who not only adamantly refuses to take accountability for their actions but instead comes up with excuses for why they did/said such horrible things."
2834,2020-05-03 17:12:39,gcpn0a,"Oh god, that's horrific, I'm glad she got away. I can't imagine how long it takes to heal from something like that."
2835,2020-05-03 16:48:13,gcpn0a,"Absolutely! DV can happen to anyone.
I just googled some stuff before I replied to another comment and you're right she wasn't allowed to speak about it. [Her ex's family is filthy rich and did everything they could to silence her.](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4066918/Tinsley-Mortimer-s-ex-trying-silence-speaking-relationship-Housewives-Bravo-orders-skip-red-carpets-involvement-secret.html)"
2836,2020-05-04 02:40:27,gcpn0a,"I agree that Dorinda is SO not over Richard‚Äôs loss, and maybe she I‚Äôll never be. I also agree John never seemed to express that he might mind that. And maybe that‚Äôs why Dorinda didn‚Äôt mind him. 

Also a lot of people have said that John would enable Dorinda‚Äôs ‚Äúpartying‚Äù so I think that‚Äôs why she stayed with him too. I think it might have helped her (not in a healthy way) in her mourning process."
2837,2020-05-03 15:06:57,gcpn0a,The editor Devorah from Bethenny‚Äôs SocialLife magazine shoot in S2 was also in High Society
2838,2020-05-03 15:49:38,gcpn0a,"The way they all interacted, I‚Äôm convinced she mostly didn‚Äôt. I think she probably had met/partied with them, and Tins couldn‚Äôt get enough actual friends to sign onto the show and marched ahead with casted friends instead of taking it as a sign she shouldn‚Äôt do the project."
2839,2020-05-04 23:32:11,gcpn0a,Pretty much shows Tinsley is not the blue blood she tries to portray herself as.
2840,2020-05-04 05:04:20,gcpn0a,[deleted]
2841,2020-05-03 14:33:32,gcpn0a,As if Hannah doesn‚Äôt also live off a trust fund? The irony...
2842,2020-05-03 15:16:11,gcpn0a,I think she also uses it as a smokescreen to avoid talking about her alcoholism.
2843,2020-05-03 14:31:00,gcpn0a,I like this theory! It doesn't make any sense that Dorinda of all people doesn't know where Tinsley's money come from.
2844,2020-05-03 14:13:49,gcpn0a,Oooo that's a good theory
2845,2020-05-04 01:48:41,gcpn0a,Carole didn't really like her.
2846,2020-05-03 20:32:04,gcpn0a,"The real rich divorces that want to be by town live on the inter coastal side. Way less traffic and tourists. 

I‚Äôm not saying tinsley or dale are paupers but people here act like they are so insanely wealthy and TBH I just don‚Äôt see it."
2847,2020-05-04 23:32:35,gcpn0a,"Tons! Google ""Tinsley Mortimer donated $10,000"" & three different stories hit on the front page alone; to one of the RHONY producer funerals, to Bethenny for B Strong, & to COVID-19."
2848,2020-05-03 22:31:20,gcpn0a,"Whoa really?  I just watched her closet tour video on YouTube & got all üòçüòçüòç over the amount of cashmere she had.  Literally, floor to ceiling stacks of cashmere.  But I never knew she made a business out of it"
2849,2020-05-03 15:39:42,gcpn0a,It was brutal. I wanted to dislike her because she has everything but her mom just fucks her up. Like dale is the most smothering and toxic person I have ever seen and I just want Tinsley to break free.
2850,2020-05-03 16:13:20,gcpn0a,I think that it was her mom's idea...
2851,2020-05-03 18:49:57,gcpn0a,"It was called ""meddling moms"" season 8 episode 141. I only saw it on a rerun on own like last year."
2852,2020-05-04 01:35:45,gcpn0a,"Yes, it absolutely does make sense. I can‚Äôt even imagine having my head stuck so far up my rich ass that I would look down on others I didn‚Äôt feel were ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù. Ugh. :/"
2853,2020-05-04 02:16:51,gcpn0a,"Tinsley would never have a child on her own - she‚Äôs been raised to be codependent, whether that‚Äôs with her mum or whoever her boyfriend/husband is at the time. 

She doesn‚Äôt have enough confidence in herself to go it alone."
2854,2020-05-03 19:40:06,gcpn0a,"Haha I actually like Whitney more back then. Now that you mention social media that all make sense how she made it! I used to work in fashion in London, although she wasn't as big people were still crazy about her during fashion weeks. I just never really like her and felt she's desperate for the front row seats and press lol"
2855,2020-05-03 20:21:25,gcpn0a,Lol exactly. He has a degree from Wharton
2856,2020-05-03 21:02:16,gcpn0a,Clearly smarter than you
2857,2020-05-03 15:30:12,gcpn0a,"They are a long-standing family here, but they have all mostly dispersed now other than a few stray cousins. Dale still has a condo right across from the Country Club of Virginia (one of the most expensive in the country) and just down the road from their old home. There was some drama when they sold their home to the Gottwalds (now of Amazon‚Äôs Making the Cut fame) and the house wasn‚Äôt as well taken care of as you‚Äôd expect. It is truly the largest property in all of Richmond and honestly a bit of an eyesore."
2858,2020-05-05 00:09:46,gcpn0a,Mah frendz
2859,2020-05-13 04:19:14,gcpn0a,"And looks tawdry, not tousled"
2860,2020-05-03 23:21:27,gcpn0a,Never heard this saying but I love it!
2861,2020-05-03 19:22:42,gcpn0a,"I will also point out, it‚Äôs clear that Scott doesn‚Äôt want her talking about him on the show.  Tinsley seems fine talking about how own stuff, but is respecting someone else‚Äôs boundaries."
2862,2020-05-04 05:54:04,gcpn0a,"I also don‚Äôt get how Dorinda always sucked up to Bethenny (after Carol left cause Dorinda was scared of her at that point in my opinion) and Bethenny kept her last few boyfriends off screen for the most part but Tinsley does the same thing because Scott does not want to be filmed and ‚Äúshe doesn‚Äôt share enough.‚Äù Dorinda has her funny comments but really deep
down is a horrible, bitter person. She gets jealous of the younger women a lot I think. She used to get really nasty with Heather as well when she first joined the show even though they were friends before the show started supposedly."
2863,2020-05-04 00:46:16,gcpn0a,I think it‚Äôs healthy she doesn‚Äôt talk about him..look at the divorce rate on any of the franchises...
2864,2020-05-04 05:57:35,gcpn0a,She‚Äôs worse than Ramona! At least Ramona will apologize! I mean she never really learns from it but at least she tries to act contrite unlike Dorinda who just makes excuses for her vile behavior.
2865,2020-05-03 17:16:37,gcpn0a,"Tinsley is NOT the empty shell of a Barbie that Dorinda projects. She's a very protective person who is shielding herself while also trying to regain fame. That's why she comes off as hiding herself, when in fact she's very emotionally guarded."
2866,2020-05-03 15:47:52,gcpn0a,And NYC Prep! She really had a hustle at the time
2867,2020-05-03 16:51:02,gcpn0a,"Devorah seemed like the least offensive person on High Society. Jules, however, was a complete trash bag of a human being and Paul didn't really have many redeeming qualities either."
2868,2020-05-04 17:37:35,gcpn0a,"The problem is that the folks in that social stratosphere would find ANY reality show horribly gauche.  There wasn‚Äôt going to be any way that Tinsley could have done this, and still kept that Mortimer level social standing.  Though this show really was particularly bad."
2869,2020-05-03 16:27:57,gcpn0a,"And dorinda even jokes about that, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt recall you ever having a job‚Äù so why is it ok for her daughter and not Tins lol"
2870,2020-05-03 22:47:51,gcpn0a,She does? I need details/ info on this please
2871,2020-05-04 08:43:09,gcpn0a,Wait what? I always got the impression that Carole and Tins were close
2872,2020-05-04 23:44:35,gcpn0a,"In my opinion the one to the producer was Scott's money, I don't see a separate one for COVID-19, and with both it's so tacky to promote her donations with the dollar amount (like posting the amount of the Harvey one on her Instagram)."
2873,2020-05-04 09:02:06,gcpn0a,"Believe me when I tell you this if the main way many of these people get their kicks. People like Tinsley are pilloried behind their backs, and active delight is taken at snubbing ""upstarts."" It's outdated, lame as hell, but all these people have to cling to."
2874,2020-05-04 17:42:18,gcpn0a,"I mean, that‚Äôs the entire basis of ‚Äúhigh society‚Äù"
2875,2020-05-03 19:50:42,gcpn0a,I liked Whitney way more too! But Olivia is east coast and more of a go getter so she fits in the ny scene a lot better than Whitney‚Äôs laid back vibe. NYers are intense and you have to have a thick backbone and be a go getter to fit in to that world.
2876,2020-05-04 09:21:02,gcpn0a,Bought by Daddy
2877,2020-05-04 09:25:39,gcpn0a,You don‚Äôt know me. What a ridiculous statement to make. I didn‚Äôt insult you personally.
2878,2020-05-03 23:54:34,gcpn0a,*more well connected does not = smarter
2879,2020-05-03 17:30:47,gcpn0a,"Definitely, but they can't see that because when she tries to share something they don't actively listen to her, they only judge.

I think it speaks volumes about her character that she went through all that without becoming bitter and angry."
2880,2020-05-06 21:24:49,gcpn0a,I tried to watch the first episode on YouTube and that Jules girl was legit racist and homophobic. Had to turn it off.
2881,2020-05-03 22:59:39,gcpn0a,Dorinda mentions it a few seasons ago when Hannah is moving out that Richard set her up with money to take care of her and now she‚Äôs of age to use it.
2882,2020-05-04 15:25:51,gcpn0a,Did you watch the last season Carole was on RHONY? Carole has said in interviews since they weren't that close. It was friendship for the show.
2883,2020-05-04 23:46:21,gcpn0a,"I disagree completely. Anyone who makes a donation can do it any way they want, it's silly to call several thousand dollars tacky. And good thing they were promoted or people like you wouldn't believe she has kindness in her heart & bank account."
2884,2020-05-04 10:31:50,gcpn0a,[Ok!](https://images.app.goo.gl/RkWQM72wBaNNiiG58)
2885,2020-05-03 17:32:41,gcpn0a,"Sonja started the narrative that Tinsley was a ditz who shops all day with ""other people's money."" Frankly, it all stunk of jealousy then and still does."
2886,2020-05-04 23:57:55,gcpn0a,"She's free to go about it however she wants. I think it's tacky to say ""I donated $x amount"" instead of just ""I made a donation to xyz cause...Donate here"" or something like that. I think Tinsley seems like she has a good heart but not enough in her own bank account to ""regularly"" make big donations on her own."
2887,2020-05-04 10:38:10,gcpn0a,Typical üôÑ
2888,2020-05-03 20:54:24,gcpn0a,Ironic really considering the only shopping Sonja's ever done is with someone else's money.

2948,2020-04-30 10:13:17,gaszzv,"Once upon a terribly dreadful time, there was a small cat-licking bird that lived on a not-so-big lane by my house whose name was Charles just like every other soul, male or female, that lived on my smelly, stinky, orange, old, rotten, messy, busted cul-de-sac between Belmont and Rose which are both Gay-ass Streets Like North street or some shit that reminds me of a celebrity like Paris Hilton or some blonde loser that doesn't even know the capital of her own country, which is the United States of America aka: The U.S.A which is a pristine nation of beauty, opposing to a country as the country of Somalia and Belgium, a part of Europe, which doesn't even have a government, it's just in a complete state of anarchy just like my mind and soul which are both filled with outrageous nonsense that I'm typing down right now into some fat long sentence that probably makes no sense but who cares I'm trying to set some sort of weird record here like most ducks snorted or some weird thing like that and if I do set some sort of record I will be in the Guinness Book of World Records (though anti-American and pro-European, a place of pitty and despair as Somalia is) which was always my dream because that book has a whole bunch a cool and weird stuff in it and I would Become famous and add to the weirdness of the book like some of their records which reminds me of the Rob & Big where Rob sets all of those skateboarding Records And Big Black eats bananas and donuts and three weeks later they both get plaques saying the record they set and I want to get one of those so that's why I'm writing all of this stuff down without ever using a period or some other sentence ending mark like an exclamation point or a question mark or any other symbol that could possibly end my streak of words that is really long now and would take me a while to count just like counting sheep which is supposed to put you to sleep but it really keeps you awake because you want to keep counting and counting until you don't know what comes after trillions, but that would take Years or something because it would take a while just to count a trillion seconds or minutes would be even worse just like how ducks are worse that geese because they are more aggressive around their young unlike great white sharks which are often eaten by their mothers when they are born and the ones who do make it out alive have no mother to teach them how to hunt or whatever because none of that matters because us human beings have mothers unless they die or run off with some CEO of a big company or someone else who makes a lot of money and then they leave you with your dad and you are jealous of your friends if you have any because they have moms and you don't because your mom was some greedy pig who wanted money but ended up only getting the money part and she bought drugs because she was depressed and ended up killing herself from an overdose and you wouldn't even know about it until you become some rich person and check the files somewhere and learn that she died of a overdose and you eyes get all teary and then you start crying because you know that you wouldn't be alive without that woman you called mom and I just found out right now that the longest sentence is like 10,000 words so I have a ways to go and you have to go with me so let's go to 6th gear and throw out some words like Emphysema which I had to do a report on in 4th grade because we had a ton of projects and this was the disease one and we chose diseases out of a hat and I came out with Emphysema which is a form of lung cancer which is 98% caused by smoking which reminds me of the way my dad describes smoking: ""you get plant leaves, wrap them in paper, light it on fire and suck on it"" which is normally a sentence but not today because I'm setting out on the quest for a long sentence that I'm typing up which reminds me of a story my grandpa told me about himself when he was ""your age"" about how they covered the letters on the type writers and they had to type so that they could memorize where the letters are on a type writer and my grandpa says he will never regret taking that class because it helped him out a lot when it came to typing and now a days he is not bad a typing at all because He is almost as fast as me because I am a pretty fast typer and writing this article isn't taking very long and expect being pretty far pretty soon at the pace I'm going right now so there are going to be some serious records getting busted when I'm finally finished writing this article on this dumb website which will probably end up huffing this article even though it is fun-packed and joyful and keeps the reader reading when they use that excuse to mom saying ""just one more sentence"" but that sentence is 10,000 words long and still continuing to go at a reasonable pace and it is going to shatter most of those long sentence records just like how the chargers are going to shatter the most consecutive years without a super bowl win record and I doubt that they will win one in the near future but they patriots are going to win some serious super bowls because they are the best team ever even better than the cowboys or 49ers and no one cares a bout them so go patriots and boo chargers even though I live in San Diego and Like the Padres I hate the Chargers because they are bad and the padres are bad too but I don't care because they are my favorite team and the dodgers are my least favorite along with the Yankees because the Yankees get a lot of money to spend and the padres and marlins get almost nothing and then the Yankees buy a-rod for a lot and the Rays get almost no money but are still fighting for first place this season without expensive players like Derek jeter or a-rod or johnny damon or whoever because they are an all around better team that can beat the Yankees even though the Yankees can beat the royals a lot who really suck because they suck more that the padres do and so do the mariners and Rockies even thought the Rockies went to the world series last year they lost and haven't stopped losing for a while now, either and they are last place in the nl west and that is where the padres used to be but they started hitting homeruns and winning games and are dong pretty good right now despite having little offense except for Adrian Gonzalez who is leading the NL in RBI's even though he is on the team who scores the least runs in the league but they are not last in homeruns though they are like 5 away or something but I‚Äôm not sure so screw that and let's talk about something fun like water or food or dirt or something but I think food is the best because their is a lot of things to talk about with food like you r favorite food which mine happens to be some spicy burrito form Chipotle mexican grill and it is very good just like this macaroni my mom made one time that had bread crumbs on top and it was very good like all of the food they serve on top chef which I wish I could be a judge for because they have a lot of good food on that show and it makes my mouth water whenever I watch it and that is why I watch it because the food is totally awesome and sometimes I hate the people but they end up getting eliminated like the Dance crews in France's Best Dance Crew which is a great show and you should watch it because people do good dancing like the JFrabbawockeez because they won the first season and they are very good just like supreme soul and So real crew and phresh select and super cr3w and I‚Äôm only at 1500 words right now so I have to write some serious stuff like a life biography about myself and anything I‚Äôve ever done which includes going to big bear to ski, fishing, breathing, swimming, going, farting, eating, sleeping and a whole lot more stuff which reminds me of 4th grade again when my teacher was debating with the class whether ""a lot"" was one or two words and all of the kids including myself said one while the teacher said two and he was right and we were wrong but no one cared because we all had fun arguing about and I have fun arguing with my friends about football and not baseball because in baseball we all like the same team but in football I like the patriots and my friends like the chargers and the 49ers and the eagles and the saints but my team always woops their team's ass and they say that the patriots ""cheat"" and that's how they won even though the patriots just pwned their team and they suck and my team is good but we all agree when it comes to baseball because we all like the padres and we never really argue over anything in baseball which is my favorite sport and I play it and I am good a it and I want it to be my profession but I doubt that that will happen so my backup plan is being a cop because you get all of the benefits and you get paid after you retire which is good news and I would also like to be some government dude or something like that because they get the benefits too so it would be cool to work for the governme

2959,2020-04-30 04:28:34,gahstr,"The better story is how she got kicked out of Canterbury (an elite college preparatory boarding school in CT).  Her brother Baron also got kicked out of a different boarding school, Berkshire.

Paris Hilton was on the JV team at Canterbury and there's actually an interview about it here from the News Times, the local newspaper that covers New Milford, where Canterbury is located: [https://www.newstimes.com/news/article/Paris-Hilton-had-a-fling-at-Canterbury-73180.php](https://www.newstimes.com/news/article/Paris-Hilton-had-a-fling-at-Canterbury-73180.php)

The article says that Paris and the school mutually agreed to her leaving.  This is what a school says when they refuse to let the student to stay, but the family has enough money to pay its way out from having an expulsion on the student's record.

Here's the story of how Paris got kicked out:  

At boarding school, students live in dorms, but so do a lot of the teachers.  These teachers are called Dorm Parents and their purpose is to make sure that students adhere to rules like study hall times (8-10) and don't get up to anything too illicit.  Paris Hilton had a driver on call and a fake ID.  It was a Wednesday night and she decided that she was going to have her driver pick her up and take her and some friends (and several football players) to one of the bars in New Milford.  Keep in mind that New Milford is a small town with a population of around 28,000 in 2010. The doors to the dorms at boarding schools lock at ""lights out"" time (11PM at Berkshire, probably similar at Canterbury) for the purpose of students not being able to sneak around after hours and get into trouble.  When Paris arrived back on campus, she was seen being dropped off via limo with other students that were also drunk.  The doors were also locked to the dorm, and she was caught red handed."

1) So I was a couple years after Paris was there. One of my friends in my year had a sister a few years older than us that went to our high school at the same time as Paris. Apparently, my friend's sister walked in on Paris doing coke in the bathroom once.
2) To the surprise of probably nobody, Paris got expelled from my school. This is actually really hard to have happen as an extremely rich person, as these smaller prep schools rely on sucking money out of the students' parents, and they are pretty happy to do ""favors"" for the kids of the extremely wealthy in exchange for donations. Apparently Paris would call her limo driver to pick her up from campus and drive her down to NYC (The school is in New Milford, CT, about 2h or so from NYC) for clubbing/parties. She did it so much and got reprimanded so many times that not even her parents' wealth could save her from expulsion."

3036,2020-04-30 03:34:38,gahstr,"I guarantee you she didn‚Äôt play. I went to a different boarding school with her (she lasted a couple weeks before transferring) the girl didn‚Äôt do anything she didn‚Äôt want to and if she *had * to, in this case, it would have been fawn legs for a short shift or two for maybe two games before she was not dressing or switched to something requiring no work. 

And not in an entitled way you would think but more in the ‚Äúthere‚Äôs just no way I‚Äôm gonna try and when they try to make me do it I‚Äôll just shut down and give up‚Äù. Just kinda weak and lazy I guess.

You get this sort of thing at lots of prep schools though. Usually they have a friend on the team, who convinces them to join. And they can't get cut, because they need to fill out the sports requirement. Most teams have a couple girls who can barely skate. Often a figure skater as well. 

The funniest part is, the girls who have played their whole life, but are the last cuts from varsity, end up on the same team. Extra funny when they're recruits. One year, my sister's JV goalie was also the starter for the South Korean national team."

I attended a girls private school and we had to pick one sport as well. I picked handball and soccer, and I really hated one of my classmates who had joined the handball team just to fill the requirement. She'd somehow get a period that lasted a month to not train, or spend the time playing on her phone, and at games (she had to play some minutes per rules) she sucked so bad it was as if we played without a winger.

We still somehow stumbled our way into a national U-17 semifinal. You'd think she was the hardest worker player by how she celebrated when we got the bronze.

Still better than what my sister went through when she was in high school thirteen years later. Her basketball team was just 3 girls breaking their butts off, and other twenty players just warming the bench. They lost every game of the season. A few had to be ended by mercy rule."

She was a swing player. So she practiced with varsity, but played games with JV because they needed to fill out the squad. Most of the girls that I mentioned above were in the same situation. It's really kinda sad, but entertaining at the same time.

The varsity girls team was also stacked. I'd wager that most top girls prep programs could compete with the national teams for nations like Korea, where hockey isn't all that popular."

You might suck, but you can engage in the activity without learning a whole new way to stand and move.

3437,2020-06-26 18:45:01,hg3e73,haha it‚Äôs a brand of 2000s clothes! their pants and skirts are rly good quality i‚Äôve found and they‚Äôre kind of rare so sellers have been pricing them pretty high

I noticed some especially healthy, active, and curious little mice in Petco probably over 2 years ago now. I could tell they weren‚Äôt your average inbred feeder mice, so I couldn‚Äôt help myself and brought 2 little ladies home! Clump, Bringer of Hell and Darkness and Paris ‚ÄúPerez‚Äù Hilton. They‚Äôve been enjoying the not-being-food life since then. 

Clump, Bringer of Hell and Darkness unfortunately passed a few months ago after developing a tumor. She truly had a full life of raging, and she will be missed. Thankfully, Paris has Coconut to keep her company until they‚Äôre back together again."

3506,2020-06-19 19:51:33,hc3gc5,"I think a lot of fans adored them together, but when there were rumours of Chad cheating on Sophia, it became a huge deal. Brooke and Brucas fans hated Chad."
3507,2020-06-19 20:09:58,hc3gc5,"Didn‚Äôt watch the show when it first came out but when I was watching the show and started doing some research about the actors (as you do when you start to fall in love with a show) and once I found out that they were married (yay) and then they got divorced (oh no) because Chad cheated on Sophia, I started to slowly resent Chad because how can one possibly cheat on SOPHIA BUSH!!!! I think that scene when Haley and Nathan get married again and Brooke says to Lucas ‚ÄòI‚Äôm not pushing you ... I‚Äôm holding on .... etc‚Äô was honestly so sad for me because you could see the hurt Sophia had felt... either that or she‚Äôs really good at acting - which she is!!!"
3508,2020-06-19 16:49:41,hc3gc5,I did watch when they were together in real life I thought they were really cute together they were both able to keep it professionally for the rest of the six years Chad stay on the show .
3509,2020-06-19 17:22:43,hc3gc5,"Sophia dates a lot of her co-stars so it‚Äôs what it is and she obviously knows how to make it work professionally. So good for her. 

But I thought Chad cheated on her with someone from the crew team who he is now married to or did I somehow make that up?

It‚Äôs Hollywood TV so all of it is par for the course. Not the first or the last tv production with BTS stuff happening. The only time it bothers me when BTS stuff shapes what happens on screen."
3510,2020-06-19 16:52:15,hc3gc5,"I think the fact that the Brucas fans hate Chad should tell you everything - they‚Äôre seemingly oblivious to the implications that Brucas only happened because of the off-screen relationship, but they just outright blame Chad for the on-screen break-up."
3511,2020-06-19 21:47:54,hc3gc5,"I didn‚Äôt watch the show during peak Chopia, but i was always amazed at her professionalism after every thing went down. Other than a couple of times of her referencing the situation, she‚Äôs barely talked about it or said his name to the point that I actually surprise myself when I remember they were actually married.

I always thought the speech she gives to Chad in season 3 finale at Naley‚Äôs wedding - the ‚ÄúI am holding on for dear life‚Äù speech  - was Sophia speaking as Sophia. Her raw emotion in that scene never fails to make me cry my eyes out."
3512,2020-06-20 01:11:17,hc3gc5,"I was watching at the time. I was so team brucas until that point. I think my hate for Lucas was from the hate of chad Michael Murray back then. I remember that back those days MTV was the huge thing and he was filming  house of wax. There was those big behind the scenes thing where Sophia went to see him and he proposed to her and was a big gesture and everything.
So when he rumours of him cheating her with his costar Paris Hilton went out. Jesus. Everybody was in shock and so mad. Because of of that circus was for what?
The fact that right after that went on air the scene of Brooke ending up with Lucas at naleys wedding was brutal and everybody took her side. The fact that he start dates a extra from set and got engaged didn't helped anything.
Well, I remember those things until now, so you can see how this was hard...
 
OMG I founded the proposal video: https://youtu.be/okSsTyYBGnc"
3513,2020-06-19 16:33:10,hc3gc5,"I don‚Äôt think I watched the show at the time they got married and divorced. But I generally don‚Äôt follow actors or care about what they do in their personal life, so I don‚Äôt think I would have cared much. I am impressed though that they managed to stay professional through the show‚Äôs run."
3514,2020-06-19 17:31:58,hc3gc5,"> But I thought Chad cheated on her with someone from the crew team who he is now married to or did I somehow make that up?

I think you‚Äôre mixing up a few different things.

Chad allegedly cheated on Sophia with Paris Hilton; after their separation, he began dating & was engaged to one of the OTH extras but they broke up; he eventually married & had children with Sarah Roemer, his co-star from Chosen."
3515,2020-06-19 17:30:35,hc3gc5,"Yeah, I remember reading about him with one of the extras. According to this article, he proposed to the extra when she was 18 and still in high school lol https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2918894/Chad-Michael-Murray-ties-knot-Chosen-star-Sarah-Roemer.html He did marry someone else though.

If I remember correctly, the girl was one of the cheerleaders and was in the scene where Brooke starts Clothes Over Bros and they're all modeling."
3516,2020-06-19 20:20:24,hc3gc5,"To be fair, they had Lucas say on screen that Peyton didn‚Äôt mean anything to him and that he made a mistake. I‚Äôm not so sure they would reunite Leyton had they not gone through a nasty divorce. I like both couples so I‚Äôm not picking sides, but when they reunited brucas to just break them up when the actors broke up it was really stupid."
3517,2020-06-20 03:01:24,hc3gc5,"Omg! CMM comes across as super douchey in this video. Also, his father's response to ""I'm going to pop the question"" was a major red flag!"
3518,2020-06-19 17:43:37,hc3gc5,As a guy it blows my mind why you'd ever cheat on Sophia Bush with Paris Hilton!
3519,2020-06-19 17:35:55,hc3gc5,Thank you for correcting me. That was so long ago that my memory is blurry on all that lol. And I really don‚Äôt follow Chad that close these days on IG. As long as everyone is happy haha.
3520,2020-06-19 17:36:44,hc3gc5,"Yeah, her name was Kenzie Dalton (I remember because I was on the forums when the show was at its peak and this was one of those topics no one stopped talking about lol). She was the very short, petite blonde on the cheerleading squad."
3521,2020-06-20 16:59:13,hc3gc5,But they didn‚Äôt break them up when the actors broke up - they had separated by the time the third season started airing. Brucas actually got back together onscreen around the time Sophia was trying to get the marriage annulled.
3522,2020-06-20 09:31:22,hc3gc5,"Yeahhhh. He seems different nowadays, married and with kids already"
3523,2020-06-19 18:36:42,hc3gc5,For real. What a downgrade
3524,2020-07-20 05:15:27,hc3gc5,[deleted]
3525,2020-06-20 23:01:18,hc3gc5,"You're right, I think he was just young. Also, back then this is what people acted like on MTV..."
3526,2020-07-20 08:04:44,hc3gc5,"Most TV shows aren‚Äôt filmed in advance of the season airing - they‚Äôll have started filming in July or August, and carried through to the following March or April.

For example, the school shooting episode was being shot in January 2006, and aired two months later. This schedule is true of most TV shows.

So yes, I‚Äôm sure about the dates."
3527,2020-06-21 09:53:52,hc3gc5,"That's true. Also I can imagine. A person in her 20' been super famous, sex symbol and blablabla, it's not easy"
3528,2020-06-19 11:52:09,hbvq5z,"The writers didn't know what to do with her so they made her ...this lol she was quite likeable in s1 but then it all went to shit and she made such horrible mistakes it was grating to watch

Serena as potrayed on the show has the potential to be a travel/life style instagrammer imo, like one of the very rich and famous ones like taramilktea but bigger"
3529,2020-06-19 17:56:54,hbvq5z,Serena's excuse that she just happens to steal the spotlight from Blair so often is also disproven by the fact that when Lola starts getting more attention than her Serena goes balistic and starts sabotaging for her.
3530,2020-06-20 10:00:52,hbvq5z,"You're 100% correct. What Headmistress Queller said always stuck a note with me. I never understood why Serena, with all her resources, did not move away and make her own way away from her own shadow. She could even have started a wellness, fashion, lifestyle brand called Scilia or something.  You know take charge of her own narrative for once. The fact that she married her stalker and called gossip girl a ""love letter"" is just the cherry on top of a disappointing character act."
3531,2020-06-19 06:52:20,hbvq5z,i liked this! good take on them
3532,2020-06-19 07:16:17,hbvq5z,">While she does fuck up A LOT, she *works* for what she wants at school and at W, wanting to build her own career in fashion on her own terms, and she *succeeds* by the show‚Äôs ending

But she didn't build it 'on her own terms'. She wanted to be her own woman, not rely on her mother's goodwill. But by the end, she's running her mother's company instead of working as the editor of a fashion magazine, a job that she and her mother both agreed was what she was destined to do. 

>In time, she‚Äôll likely be regarded as one of the greats of the industry, with her name alongside van Herpen and Jacquemus

I sincerely doubt it. Those people are fashion designers and they have their own line of fashion that they build. Blair isn't a fashion designer like Eleanor previously said, she's running her mother's company which she didn't build and she's had to hire Jenny (J for Waldorf).

Blair really didn't end up any better than Serena imo. The only difference between them is we see Blair with Waldorf Designs and that she inherited due to nepotism. 

If people can imagine up scenarios where Blair is successful based on the little we saw of her trying (and mostly struggling) to run Waldorf designs, why can't people do the same where Serena becomes a Hollywood producer or something based on the little we saw of her doing that in season 5?"
3533,2020-06-19 06:54:54,hbvq5z,i think by season six serena has a little more power ( she gets into that conservancy thing and blairs impressed by that ) but even the glimpses we do get of them in the future it seems like blair achieved more ( and the flash forward shows she was majorly successful with taking over waldorf designs ) . I always hoped we would get serena like she was in LA again away from everything hard working and impressing people w her personality.
3534,2020-06-19 06:55:33,hbvq5z,So true. Amazing thoughts!!
3535,2020-06-19 06:53:17,hbvq5z,Thank you!
3536,2020-06-19 11:55:16,hbvq5z,"In the final scene blair is talking on the phone in chinese, and jenny did a collab with her - se we can assume that they both grew up and patched up their differences and that blair's company is big enough to do business in china. She also had a child and a town house in ny. 

With serena we have NOTHING. She married to dan in her bff's home. She doesn't even talk lol."
3537,2020-06-19 07:51:26,hbvq5z,"OMGGGG k so I misremembered a lot it‚Äôs been a while since I watched ^_^ but at the very least, we get CONFIRMATION that she‚Äôs running waldorf designs, and it wouldn‚Äôt hamper the way the public views her if she‚Äôs genuinely good at the position she got due to nepotism. We don‚Äôt get that with Serena, the last we see of her IS just her marrying Dan, in new york. In a season that started with her in another dead end relationship with a man too old for her hiding from her friends and family that ended with her ending up the guy who terrorized her for years because he wanted to ‚Äúwrite himself into her life‚Äù and she has extreme self worth issues and is blown away by the fact that someone who knows all the darkest parts of her could possibly love her..Blair is with Chuck of all people but at least she has something of her own, even if it was passed down to her. Idk I‚Äôm just sad and frustrated with the fact that despite being the main draw to the show Serena never really gets to progress past being a socialite despite having a clear potential for a career in the movie industry. What we‚Äôre shown in canon is just that ugly gold wrap dress and I hate it"
3538,2020-06-19 06:59:01,hbvq5z,She had SO much potential it hurts that she ended up back in UES society when she thrives away from it :(((((
3539,2020-06-19 11:24:29,hbvq5z,Lol and she only gets the conservancy thing because her boyfriend set that up for her.
3540,2020-06-19 12:27:53,hbvq5z,"also, these people are fucking millionaires. But that bitch stepped out in the ugliest gold wedding dress I've ever seen. Walked down the stairs and got married in her best friends house, which is completely devoid of any decoration.(Serena couldn't rent some venue, even poor people can afford to do that, or in the very least she could have it at her own house?)  
 She only has 5 people there. Which are basically only her closest friends. Her parents are not there. No guests are there. like???"
3541,2020-06-19 18:45:15,hbvq5z,"Honestly, everyone hates nepotism until they can benefit from it. I agree it usually isn‚Äôt great, but if it‚Äôs a privately held company and a parent wants their child to run it, it‚Äôs their choice. Nepotism makes it easy for them to acquire the job but not necessarily easier from them to actually do the job. Blair is a hustler and unquestionably intelligent from what we have seen, she might have struggled to run the company or she may have flourished. She is also 25 at the time of the finale, she could have carried on running her mother‚Äôs company for another 5 years and become an editor. Your life sentence isn‚Äôt declared at 25, people move around jobs and industries way past their retirement!

As for Serena, we don‚Äôt actually see where she ends up. She could have been running a PR company, using her experience as a basis, or producing films. There is also no indicator she is still living in NYC, she could have moved to LA like everyone wants her to, I see how she looks ‚ÄòLA‚Äô but she‚Äôs a Manhattan girl to me. As for ‚Äòshe married Dan Humphrey‚Äô ‚Äî I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs totally fair. He didn‚Äôt grow up a billionaire, but he actually made something of himself. I‚Äôm not siding for Serena vs Blair, but isn‚Äôt this ‚Äòmarrying up‚Äô nonsense what got Blair into trouble with Louis. Regardless of how viewers think of Dan as a person, he is someone she knows well and he is a hard worker. Yes, he is an outsider who weaved his way into the UES despite continuously trashing it, literarily (not a typo for ‚Äòliterally‚Äô) and figuratively, but it doesn‚Äôt matter. He was an accomplished writer, who probably continued to write more books, and was the first of the group to get an apartment with his own money. Blair also dated Dan!"
3542,2020-06-19 13:14:55,hbvq5z,"Both her parents are there though lol
I actually like the dress, but yeah the budget looks tight after season 5ish"
3543,2020-06-19 02:33:46,hbs8we,"There was a time where i truly wondered if we would stop hearing about every little detail of her life. It finally happened and I‚Äôve waited for so long for the Kardashians to have the same thing happened but that‚Äôs def not happening anytime soon or maybe ever idk. I still can‚Äôt believe people still make up crap about brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston it‚Äôs insane to me. 

Know who i would like to see oh bh? Nicole Richie she was actually pretty darn funny on the simple life"
3544,2020-06-19 06:15:51,hbs8we,"The Simple Life was amazing... for it's time.  I recently rewatched all but the last season on YT.  I hate how every other sub doesn't get the point of the show (they're were playing up the dumb, rich, spoiled thing-- it's not complicated) and vilify the girls.  As a RH fan, I can appreciate the show for what is was at the time.  I remember being over Paris in the early 2000s, but I will take her back now if that means no more Kardashians (that's a show I look back on and wonder why I ever watched). 

If you're looking to take your mind off of things, I highly recommend!  It's stupid, light-hearted humor."
3545,2020-06-19 03:50:06,hbs8we,Don't feel shame - I fucking LOVE Paris.
3546,2020-06-19 03:50:26,hbs8we,I LOVED Nicole Richie on the Simple Life
3547,2020-06-19 03:00:57,hbs8we,"You can check out modern day Nicole Richie on some episodes of Making the Cut on Amazon Prime! She doesn‚Äôt get a chance to show much personality though, since she‚Äôs a judge."
3548,2020-06-19 09:33:05,hbs8we,I've seen every episode of the simlle life and loved everyone lol those girls were a riot!
3549,2020-06-19 13:44:27,hbs8we,yessssssssss love to love an extremely well known racist!

3552,2020-06-18 13:21:08,hb6bae,thank you so much
3553,2020-06-27 04:46:13,hb6bae,I've heard beta blockers when used long enough will make you feel dissociated from everything sometimes including your own body.what's your take on it?do you think betablockers have that ability to do so personally?
3554,2020-06-18 05:06:20,hb6bae,probably after 4 weeks. i am hyper aware of my heart rate and body anxiety though. it probably worked after week 2 but i focused all of my attention on my heart rate so i couldn‚Äôt really tell it was working until i shifted my focus away from my heart rate which was at week 4

Question | Answer | Link
---------|----------|----------|
Fascinating AMA, thanks. Are you of similar age and wealth? Do you live together? Are you ever permitted to climax?|Thank you! Yes, similar age and wealth. Living together. I am permitted to climax so long as it's hands free (prostate orgasm etc). Masturbation is rarely something I get to indulge in, it's a rare treat. I'm often in chastity. I love that though because it makes it a million times better when it does happen.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/h9eskv/im_a_gay_bdsm_slave_ama/fuxxcym/)
Hi. Do you have foot fetish?|I wouldn't say so. I do kiss and lick Master's feet if told to and I enjoy it but it's only because it plays into the psychological pleasure I get from being of service to him. Not so much that I'm being turned on by feet. Does that make sense?|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/h9eskv/im_a_gay_bdsm_slave_ama/fuw5yhc/)
Do you consider any of the relationship as romantic?|A lot of it is. I think it's easy to imagine BDSM relationships as nothing but filth but we are both deeply in love with each other and are very romantic towards each other. He is my protector. If I'm upset or stressed he'll often hold me and tell me I'll always be safe with him and how much I mean to him. We would honestly take a bullet for each other, no questions asked.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/h9eskv/im_a_gay_bdsm_slave_ama/fuw6vas/)
Are you a leather boy?|Absolutely. Master's not the most enthusiastic when it comes to fetish clothing. He finds it a bit silly actually. But I love leather. It's sort of a reward for me when the leather makes an appearance üòÇ|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/h9eskv/im_a_gay_bdsm_slave_ama/fuw7pn1/)
What brings you to reddit?|Lockdown, to be completely honest. Boredom. üòÇ|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/h9eskv/im_a_gay_bdsm_slave_ama/fuw8ftj/)
Thanks, didn‚Äôt see it as just pure filth but from an outside perspective assumed somewhat ignorantly that it‚Äôs based purely on the sexual/mental gratification from the activity and romance didn‚Äôt play a factor.|Oh ok. My bad if I offended you in any way. Obviously I can't speak for all BDSM relationships or even for the ""average"" one (whatever that is) but certainly for us it's very romantic.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/h9eskv/im_a_gay_bdsm_slave_ama/fuwar9g/)
Do you call your partner Master/Sir in public among other people like close friends, or do you have to act like a more ""regular"" couple when you're among other people?  Also not a question but by reading the other comments your relationship sounds awesome, you're lucky to have that :)|Aw thanks! I feel lucky to have it. Of course, it isn't for everyone but it's perfect for me.  No, I don't call him Master or Sir in public. Only if we're among other BDSM people, which rarely happens or if we're among certain gay people but even then I would only use Sir and not Master as that's more common in the gay community, even outside of a BDSM scenario. We're not ashamed or anything, some family and friends are vaguely aware of our dynamic and they don't see an issue with it but just like I wouldn't want to hear them dirty talking in front of me, I don't think they'd like it if I started calling him Master in front of them either üòÇ  Obviously if we're in public but away from people or in a club/gig or any situation where people can't really hear us, we'll use Sir/Master/slave.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/h9eskv/im_a_gay_bdsm_slave_ama/fuwr9z6/)
How did you realize you're into this?|It was a gradual thing for me. When I started having sex I quickly realised I liked control dynamics. I was actually, strictly a top to begin with. I wasn't fully comfortable being gay yet so I guess that was a way of holding on to my idea of masculinity at the time. Once I grew up a bit and became more comfortable and less self conscious, I realised I could explore anything I wanted to sexually and that it had no bearing on how much of a ""man"" I was. So I became versatile, then a bottom, then a sub and now a slave.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/h9eskv/im_a_gay_bdsm_slave_ama/fuwuthx/)
Hurt?|Which part? üòÇ|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/h9eskv/im_a_gay_bdsm_slave_ama/fuxgtco/)
Favorite aftercare?|Spooning.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/h9eskv/im_a_gay_bdsm_slave_ama/fuxi7t7/)
Do you have to ask for permission for everything you do in your life? I mean does he control other parts of you life other than the sexual part??|Not everything. Our relationship exists within the realm of reality. Having to ask if I can work or go to the bathroom every single time would just be unreasonable. Basically he loves me so that's what he always leads with. We discuss any life decisions and things like that and he always takes my opinion into account and has my best interests at heart but the final call is Master's to make. I won't drink alcohol if Master tells me not to, for instance. I won't wear something or do my hair a certain way if Master tells me not to. I am his property but I am also his lover and best friend. He has never and would never purposely make a decision that would cause me harm or make me unhappy. There are punishments and discipline, of course, but they are never cruel. They usually involve some kind of sexual deprivation.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/h9eskv/im_a_gay_bdsm_slave_ama/fuym43g/)
An interesting AMA.  What got you interested in the first place? Do you have much knowledge about the BDSM community?  If these questions are too personal, you don't need to answer. I am a very curious person.|Like I said earlier, it was a gradual process for me. I definitely started my sexual journey as a pretty ""normal"" person (as much as I hate describing it that way but you know what I mean). With each sexual partner I learned more about myself and what I did and didn't enjoy until I got to where I am today with my Master.  I can't say I am the most knowledgeable about the community, no. I can speak for my own experience and my own relationship. Master and I are not involved with any clubs or anything like that. We created our own rules. Some match typical BDSM concepts, some probably don't. It's a purely personal thing.  No need to apologize for curiosity. üòä|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/h9eskv/im_a_gay_bdsm_slave_ama/fuys8bt/)

3585,2020-06-15 11:54:38,h9eskv,"Yes, it makes perfect sense. One more question: do you enjoy being spat on?"
3586,2020-06-15 12:22:31,h9eskv,"Apologies. You may be misunderstanding. Being a leather boy is a role often paired with being a gay slave. It's a high protocol role that even has competitions and was one of the earliest forms of BDSM in the U.S., beginning with the gay male community."
3587,2020-06-15 22:52:22,h9eskv,Hmmm I‚Äôd think that your lifestyle wouldn‚Äôt be that boring.
3588,2020-06-15 13:04:12,h9eskv,"No offence taken at all! I didn‚Äôt want you to think that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs viewed from the outside, from my perspective certainly."
3589,2020-06-16 00:50:33,h9eskv,"Thank you for clarifying this. You sound like you two are really in love and love your relationship. I hope you grow old on the same pillow ( it s an expression from my country) and last thing what about social media; or instance posting a pic or doing this AMA?

3598,2020-06-15 23:10:42,h9eskv,As a willing participant I‚Äôd figure you can ‚Äòcome‚Äô up with all kinds of fun things to do.
3599,2020-06-16 01:20:23,h9eskv,"Thank you for answering. Even though i m not related to the bdsm life, and know no one who does, (as it is ""prohibted in my country) i could just see and sense that that franchise couldnt depict what really goes down between two persons of that lifestyle. And Im sorry you feel insulted over something you love so much. Good luck and live a good life full of love and laughter."

3651,2020-06-12 05:01:31,h78ybk,"Both their contributions to the entertainment world were more than just the blowjob. And this sub is mostly based on looks, not talent anyway. It comes down to a choice between blonde with wonderful perky tits vs brunette with insane curves (her big ass is also used well in the video)"
3652,2020-06-12 09:57:26,h78ybk,My comment was more of a joke than actual breakdown on choice. Sorry you missed that
3653,2020-06-12 10:10:49,h78ybk,"Just trying to take your joke further. It was my original intend with the post. I only decided against putting something like ""Blowjob heroes/Sex tape millionaires of the 2000s"" in the title, for fear of having the post removed :)"

You've let it get into your head that all women will treat you like shit which totally wrong, you've decided you might aswell go out of your way to be rude to them.. When youre rude they're only going to take offence and be rude in return, when you see them being rude it's going to reinforce your fictional reality of all women being horrible."
3666,2020-06-10 22:57:14,h0ltpo,You are so right - but it's not going to matter. OP is either a troll or a pos. As evidenced in his reply to you. Calling all women whores because they don't want to date his creepy ass just goes to show how pathetic his life is. I'm not feeding him. Not worth the energy.
3667,2020-06-10 22:59:23,h0ltpo,Yeah I gave up. What does POS mean?

3673,2020-06-10 22:28:35,h0leck,You need some help and lots of work on your self esteem. Not everything is based on how women view you. if it bothers you so much then why dont you change how you look or change your personality?
3674,2020-06-10 22:53:50,h0leck,"That's not true at all. 

This is some incel self hypnose shit you need to believe because you're thirsty and incapable of captivating attention fast enough so you're frustrated and attracted to reductionist cult theories. 

You need help if you really want to see people beaten up just because nobody is falling before your feet.

I've seen countless examples that just crush your theory. Just look up Wriggs and Grumps. Explain me how your theory fits there. 

If you're that ugly and small, just be useful, funny, smart or get rich then, why do you think men try to become  exceptional or rich? It's to be selected faster."

3688,2020-06-29 02:14:34,hhj0td,It‚Äôs cool that Emma Watson is a 1w2 since Hermione is a 1w2

congrats buddy"
3690,2020-06-28 21:35:43,hhj0td,"Add Obama as a 9.  Trump is a counter phobic 6, imo, as he confidently projects his own fears."
3691,2020-06-28 21:48:12,hhj0td,As a 6w5 I want to change teams now.
3692,2020-06-29 09:16:55,hhj0td,I‚Äôm thinking Jordan Peterson is either a 1w2 (unyielding crusader) or a 6w5 (cerebral sentinel). Hadn‚Äôt considered that he‚Äôd be a 5. But I could actually see him as a 5w6 - he‚Äôs very much into how hostile and hard the world is. Not really a 5w4 though...
3693,2020-06-30 07:41:49,hhj0td,Jordan Peterson? Oh no
3694,2020-06-28 21:38:38,hhj0td,Most are wrong lol ü§£ü§£ü§£ but its okay. Keep studying emneagram so typing can be more accurate‚òùÔ∏è‚òùÔ∏èüëèüëèüëè we all are still learning

3697,2020-06-29 14:40:14,hhj0td,"I love Joe Rogan and listen to him religiously but there is no way that man is anything but a mature, calmed down counter-phobic six. An 8 he is not, no way."
3698,2020-06-29 14:53:30,hhj0td,Walt Disney is also a 9 :) I think a 9w1
3699,2020-06-29 22:49:17,hhj0td,I would actually say that Christopher Nolan is a 5w4 instead 5w6 bc of his insane story plots. he writes all of his movies so he‚Äôs either really balanced in his wings or i think he‚Äôs much more in touch with his 4 wing. you don‚Äôt get plots like tenet or inception without a 4 wing lol
3700,2020-06-28 23:32:00,hhj0td,I'm so confused by this comment lol.
3701,2020-06-29 04:42:19,hhj0td,True lol.
3702,2020-06-29 22:46:19,hhj0td,i actually think she‚Äôs a sp 3w4 with a tritype 3-1-6. sp 3w4 often mistypes as 1s.
3703,2020-06-28 21:06:18,hhj0td,I just used a popular website to find the information.
3704,2020-06-28 22:34:00,hhj0td,I was torn on Obama. I can't decide whether he's a 3 or 9 lol.
3705,2020-06-28 21:38:15,hhj0td,"Trump is not a counterphobic 6. He‚Äôs confident, big picture, and a megalomaniac. He‚Äôs a hard 8."
3706,2020-06-28 22:34:51,hhj0td,Lol. Why?
3707,2020-06-30 07:43:20,hhj0td,"Bruh I have Jordan Peterson

Please end me"
3708,2020-06-29 12:44:15,hhj0td,"Yeah, possibly."
3709,2020-06-28 22:34:34,hhj0td,Can you offer some examples of ones that are wrong?
3710,2020-06-30 07:42:57,hhj0td,The audacity and irony of this comment... Jesus.
3711,2020-06-28 23:04:06,hhj0td,"""Most are wrong lololol.....keep studying so typing can be more accurate"" 

The ignorance and irony of that statement...."
3712,2020-06-29 01:28:43,hhj0td,"Hey, enneagram doesn't determine your belief system lol. Any type can be a conservative or liberal."
3713,2020-06-29 12:44:32,hhj0td,No problem!
3714,2020-06-30 01:24:38,hhj0td,"Oh, I definitely think he's an 8, but with a 7 wing (his love of stimulation and exploration) instead of 9.  


He does at times talk about the anxiety he felt as a kid, but I think that's more 8 anxiety (the need for strength and control) than 6 (the need for security)."
3715,2020-06-29 14:46:01,hhj0td,"Yeah, I could see that too. Honestly, counterphobic sixes look almost identical to 8s to me."
3716,2020-06-29 14:55:55,hhj0td,"Oh, yes. I totally forgot about him."
3717,2020-06-29 22:51:50,hhj0td,"Yeah, that's possible. I see 5w6 more than 5w4 though. He does probably have balanced wings though."
3718,2020-06-29 00:58:31,hhj0td,John Mulaney reference
3719,2020-06-30 03:03:10,hhj0td,"Hmm i could see that and that mistype does seem pretty common... but I feel like Hermione would rather do things the RIGHT way and be moral than cut corners to achieve, and acting ‚Äúcorrectly‚Äù is more important than getting it done or achieving, which is a big difference between a 1 and a 3. This is seen when she won‚Äôt let the boys copy her HW (most of the time), and when Hermione is mad when she thinks Harry put felix felicis into Ron‚Äôs drink for quidditch tryouts, etc.. Although if 1 is in her tritype like you say than maybe that could explain it. Cheers"
3720,2020-06-28 22:33:23,hhj0td,"If you think trump is an 8, please for the love of god try to understand 8‚Äôs better. We deserve at least a bare minimum effort"
3721,2020-06-28 23:13:27,hhj0td,"""Through denying their feelings of fear to one extent or another, Sexual Sixes go against danger from a position of strength; therefore, they have a passion for searching for or securing a position of strength. And it's not just a strong character they seek, but the kind of strength that makes somebody else afraid-they want to assume a powerful enough to hold the enemy at a distance. These Sixes display a forcefulness that comes from no wanting to be weak, and they don't allow for weakness in themselves....""

"".....Sexual Sixes have a need not just for strength but for intimidation. As Naranjo suggests, this expression of intimidation is very much the essence of the character; if they appear strong, they won't be attacked. ....""

"".....Sexual Sixes give off the impression that they could get violent with anybody at any time, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that they have no fear. It is precisely out of a sense of fear that their anticipation of an attack comes-there is a somewhat paranoid imagining of danger, a belief that anyone can turn into a threat. However, these Sixes usually do not look afraid; their visible character could hardly be called ""fearful"" from the outside.

In contrast to the Self-Preservation Six, who backs away from threats, the couterphobic Sexual Six tends to move toward risky situations, feeling a sense of safety in actually confronting danger rather than hiding from it or avoiding it. They convince themselves (and others) that they are not victims of fear; they are convinced that fear is an emotion that should be eliminated systemically.....""

"".....The fact that these Sixes regularly move against danger (or perceived danger) can, at times, give them the appearance of a rebel, a daredevil, a risk taker, an adrenaline junkie, or a troublemaker. In some cases, Sexual Sixes may be prone to megalomania or having a ""hero complex."" In their own way, they seek to be ""good guys"" to avoid being punished. They may have the illusion that they are spontaneous, but they tend not to be.

Sexual Sixes tend to be very contrarian: they always have an argument at hand to refute and contradict an opinion. Instead of thinking in terms of ""best-case"" or ""worst-case"" scenarios, they think in terms of contrarian scenarios-if the trend is for others to focus on the worst, they will focus on the best; but if everyone is focusing on the best, they will assert the worst.....""


Beatrice Chestnuts countertype 6.   Prone to megalomania ? 

Tell me that doesnt sound like Trump."
3722,2020-06-28 22:40:36,hhj0td,"We have boring people, Woody Allen (a pedophile), and Eminem (A sexist douchebag). The only person I kind of like on the list of  6w5‚Äôs is Tolkien and maybe Malcolm X . But I like MLK Jr better who the 8‚Äôs have."
3723,2020-06-28 22:40:20,hhj0td,Anthony Hopkins has often been typed as a 5w4

3725,2020-06-29 01:29:11,hhj0td,Oh lol. I think I remember that now.
3726,2020-06-30 16:52:15,hhj0td,"yeah what you explained is what i think is the 1 in her tritype, which is her secondary type. what makes me believes she is a 3 is her worst fear when it came to the boggart was a failed test. to me, that just screams 3 bc hermione is way more focused on achievements, ‚Äúwe could have been killed, or worse, expelled‚Äù (i know it‚Äôs the exact right line, but you get the point). She also used the time turner to take more classes, which to me screams 3. She also breaks the rules a lot. i know it‚Äôs for the greater good a lot, but she breaks so many rules that a 1 would have a heart attack. That‚Äôs why I think she‚Äôs a 3 and not a 1. My sister is a sp 3w4, and we thought for a while she was a 1, and she is almost identical to hermione. That‚Äôs my two cents. Have a good day!"
3727,2020-06-28 22:37:11,hhj0td,[The enneagram institute literally lists him as a type 8](https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-8)

3731,2020-06-29 14:56:38,hhj0td,Really? I thought 8's were all about respect?
3732,2020-06-28 22:43:00,hhj0td,Also if you don‚Äôt stand up for people hurting because of your pride or it might look bad for you... not an 8
3733,2020-06-28 22:41:18,hhj0td,"The enneagram institute is not the all seeing eye, infallible, an 8, or are they trump himself who is the only one who can confirm his number. He wreaks of fear and is consumed with polls and shit we could care less about. #notallassholesare8"
3734,2020-06-28 22:47:45,hhj0td,Thank you!
3735,2020-06-28 22:46:03,hhj0td,Of fucking course not I‚Äôm just answering your question- I just finished a book called archetypes of the enneagram where the author talks about him as a 5w4 .

3737,2020-06-28 22:45:23,hhj0td,"I never said all 8‚Äôs are assholes. But just because you don‚Äôt like someone doesn‚Äôt mean they aren‚Äôt your type. Hell, Hitler was probably a 6 and as a 6 I don‚Äôt deny that he is one even if he was a horrible person.
Also I‚Äôm not trying to attack your credibility or make it personal but I think the enneagram institute is probably a more reliable source than you or I."
3738,2020-06-28 22:47:40,hhj0td,"Wow, just chill man. I was just asking lol. I got my typing from two main sources. You can go check them out if you want."

What is mega frustrating is people acting like his narcissism and ‚Äúmegalomania‚Äù makes him an 8. It‚Äôs a lazy way to write someone off. The enneagram institute is really close on a lot of things and a great resource, but it‚Äôs super dangerous to type people, even your own friends, based on some blanket stereotypes. Understanding you‚Äôre a 6, I get that you‚Äôre leaning into the big group that‚Äôs a credible resource and I can dig you arguing an opinion. You‚Äôre a good questioner, question more on this one. Not going to debate ‚Äúthey said he was so he must be‚Äù."

3742,2020-06-28 22:48:46,hhj0td,Yeah I mean who can ever be sure anyone else‚Äôs type is true? I was just saying what I gathered same as you have gathered
3743,2020-06-29 04:02:56,hhj0td,"Trump is an 8 because his main issue is with boundaries and being told no, and he responds to that in an aggressive, overreactive way. Hence, 8."
3744,2020-06-28 23:10:57,hhj0td,I was thinking that too lol. That's funny.
3745,2020-06-28 22:49:35,hhj0td,"Yeah, I agree. It's always hard to know for sure."
3746,2020-06-29 11:42:55,hhj0td,"A lot of numbers are defiant. Both 6‚Äôs and 8‚Äôs can be this way specifically, from my observation he‚Äôs a little too irrationally aggressive. This is behavior not motivation."
3747,2020-06-29 23:58:44,hhj0td,"Yes, and you're ignoring the part where I said, ""his main issue is with boundaries and being told no"", which is motivation. 

Will Hunting is a counterphobic 6, you can see the difference between the two. Everything Will does is fear based, even when he gets unruly and abrasive. He fears getting hurt (his trauma definitely plays into that, and there's nothing to suggest that enneagram type isn't born from trauma)."

3770,2020-06-28 09:32:36,hh77pd,"Kim D's lips. ü¶Ü
Edit: Melissa's daughter is her twin though."
3771,2020-06-28 14:00:14,hh77pd,She bought a whole face.
3772,2020-06-28 04:27:23,hh77pd,They fucking wish lmao
3773,2020-06-28 14:39:17,hh77pd,Talk about a glow up for Melissa.
3774,2020-06-28 16:47:47,hh77pd,"I thought Melissa said she didn‚Äôt want the word out on her nose job(s?) because of Antonia. She didn‚Äôt want Antonia to think there was anything wrong with the way she looks.

Weird move to deny it for so long...
It‚Äôs her FACE it‚Äôs pretty obvious"
3775,2020-06-28 09:55:57,hh77pd,Just slittered my coffee down myself laughing at this!  üòÅüëèüèªüëèüèª
3776,2020-06-28 10:06:53,hh77pd,"Look at that, Melissa's original nose"
3777,2020-06-28 11:13:09,hh77pd,Maybe Kim is her long lost sister
3778,2020-06-28 12:08:02,hh77pd,I just went and looked at her Instagram and it looks like she‚Äôs gone and done her nose AGAIN. Can you believe it girls? IMO it was totally unnecessary
3779,2020-06-28 04:04:15,hh77pd,Reminds me more of Kyle and Kim.
3780,2020-06-28 05:48:06,hh77pd,Omg so funny! Thanks for posting
3781,2020-06-28 13:35:41,hh77pd,Man the thumbnail vs normal photo is like the definition of Monet.
3782,2020-06-28 12:57:07,hh77pd,Melissa has the best lip injections in the game. Wish she would say who does them
3783,2020-06-28 03:18:39,hh77pd,She only had ONE NOSE JOB!!!!
3784,2020-06-28 03:13:26,hh77pd,I barely recognized her
3785,2020-06-28 12:49:55,hh77pd,I think her work is very good. She definitely looks different but I don‚Äôt think she looks overdone.
3786,2020-06-28 04:02:46,hh77pd,"To be fair this is a HORRIBLE picture and her makeup / style / hair game was atrocious at that point. 

Not to say she hasn't had work done but you shouldn't underestimate the power of a good hair and makeup team and a stylist lmao"
3787,2020-06-28 16:53:49,hh77pd,I will never ever understand people who deny it. WE LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE PICTURES EXIST. I‚Äôd have some work done too if I had the means and I sure as shit wouldn‚Äôt pretend my face magically transformed itself and insult the intelligence of anyone who has a pair of eyeballs üôÑ
3788,2020-06-28 13:03:41,hh77pd,Yeah you always gotta do an episode jump from a housewives first episode to most current every few seasons to see the transition. Someone needs to make that GIF!
3789,2020-06-28 03:30:03,hh77pd,Don‚Äôt do Patsy and Edina like that! üòÇ
3790,2020-06-28 04:23:59,hh77pd,Blasphemy!!
3791,2020-06-28 04:12:09,hh77pd,The lords work üò©üòÇ
3792,2020-06-28 13:09:04,hh77pd,That‚Äôs the crazy thing. I think she must have gotten small things done in between seasons? Maybe I‚Äôm crazy but always felt like her work was gradual/not noticeable.
3793,2020-06-28 04:03:18,hh77pd,I'm pretty sure it's the same one as jacquelines lol
3794,2020-06-28 12:28:39,hh77pd,She needs to be like Ramona and support other women. She promotes Dr. Giese like it‚Äôs her job lol
3795,2020-06-28 08:22:15,hh77pd,Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏èüò≠
3796,2020-06-28 05:50:01,hh77pd,Yes! They look very witchy and not in a sexy way.
3797,2020-06-28 06:22:35,hh77pd,She's def had a brow lift as well... she's had quite a bit done.
3798,2020-06-28 12:55:10,hh77pd,And paper thin lips.
3799,2020-06-28 03:27:29,hh77pd,Yes
3800,2020-06-28 04:02:41,hh77pd,Money well spent
3801,2020-06-28 04:02:27,hh77pd,I can‚Äôt wait to marry someone rich and use their money to make me pretty
3802,2020-06-28 18:25:04,hh77pd,"I got my nose job three months ago and it was the best decision ever, especially because it coincided with the start of quarantine so i‚Äôve had 3 ish months to recover"
3803,2020-06-28 04:49:31,hh77pd,It‚Äôs crazy realizing how much work she‚Äôs had done over time
3804,2020-07-01 00:40:59,hh77pd,"He wasn‚Äôt calling you raccoon face, he was saying that about Kathy!"
3805,2020-06-28 04:49:08,hh77pd,"I love early RHONJ. I just wish the Gorga/Giudice drama only expanded over one season, not three"
3806,2020-06-28 03:41:29,hh77pd,Is she still insisting she had no nose jobs ? A couple of years ago she was still claiming that...
3807,2020-06-28 04:52:35,hh77pd,And her chin looks narrower now...
3808,2020-06-28 17:36:55,hh77pd,"I only just started NJ a few weeks ago and when I watched the first ep of S3 and first saw Melissa, I even posted here that WHOA, she looks different."
3809,2020-06-28 12:54:08,hh77pd,I agree. I don‚Äôt like that she lies about the work she had done but she looks fucking amazing
3810,2020-06-28 07:23:18,hh77pd,And good lighting! Am I the only one to think that Kim D has incredible eyes?

3816,2020-06-28 03:30:43,hh77pd,I thought so!!
3817,2020-06-28 14:53:52,hh77pd,I just hope she doesn't go overboard with it. She was awfully close to going too far this past season.
3818,2020-06-28 11:14:42,hh77pd,"As my friends and I always say, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not ugly, you‚Äôre poor.‚Äù"
3819,2020-06-28 04:04:34,hh77pd,"She said on the show that it‚Äôs ‚Äúthe worlds worst kept secret, I‚Äôve had a nose job‚Äù after Jacqueline yelled it out at her. She‚Äôs yet to acknowledge just how many though"
3820,2020-06-28 13:58:56,hh77pd,"She‚Äôs had 4. Jac called her out on it and Melissa pretty much said ‚ÄúYeah, I did. It wasn‚Äôt your business to tell‚Äù"
3821,2020-06-28 03:42:25,hh77pd,"No,ha ha ha!! How could she? ‚ÄúThey‚Äù claim she‚Äôs had like five or six shnoz jobs and she claims she‚Äôs only had one. To clarify..."
3822,2020-06-28 10:07:31,hh77pd,I think she admitted to 4 when Jacq called her out
3823,2020-06-28 14:05:25,hh77pd,"i HATE melissa. i think she's obsessed with herself but i can't deny that she looks amazing. i think back in the day when she first came on, she was pretty (especially for that time), but i think the work she's had done looks great. like someone already said, it doesn't look overdone. she just looks like a totally different person."
3824,2020-06-28 04:29:59,hh77pd,I‚Äôll just here sobbing into my Christian Lacroix bustier with my Bolli and Stoli.
3825,2020-06-28 04:25:59,hh77pd,"Damn, right? Why is it a ‚Äúsecret‚Äù when you got a whole new face lmao! I don‚Äôt get it...I screamed at the amount of flashbacks they did this season with her old face üòÇ"
3826,2020-06-28 10:26:46,hh77pd,"Because it's a common practice for the famous, *and slightly famous*, to get work done and pretend they haven't."
3827,2020-06-28 17:31:57,hh77pd,I hear about people getting their jaws and chins shaved down.  Is this really a procedure?
3828,2020-06-28 18:30:57,hh77pd,Her nose is starting to look a little Janet Jackson...

3830,2020-06-28 17:34:47,hh77pd,She really had 4?  What was wrong with the first one in S4?  Why did she need to do more?
3831,2020-06-28 17:21:36,hh77pd,"Maybe its just me but I don't get the big deal about this. She was fine before and after the nose job and it was obvious she had one. Is that supposed to be something she's ashamed about? (From the way some of the other wives act and what is posted here) plenty of them get breast augmentation and botox, but its an issue Melissa has a nose job? (this isn't a criticism directed at you, I just replied here because the actual quantity of nose jobs was being discussed)"
3832,2020-06-28 03:47:14,hh77pd,I can‚Äôt remember what reunion it was but i swear it was fairly recent - like 2-3 years ago - and she said she hasn‚Äôt had any work done. I was like ok...

3839,2020-06-28 23:14:11,hh77pd,"I don‚Äôt understand their criticisms either. Melissa just hadn‚Äôt spoken about all of her nose jobs and it seemed her response was more ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not Jac‚Äôs place to talk about my surgery‚Äù. There are more important things, like RHONJ‚Äôs homophobia, to focus on rather than who has had however many nose jobs lol"
3840,2020-06-29 04:57:54,hh77pd,"i think people make fun of her for it because she was asked multiple times about it by andy (on wwhl) and on the season 5 reunion (they showed it in either the unseen footage episode or it was a bonus clip on the bravo site... i forget) but she would tell a bold faced lie about it and say it was just ""contour"" lol. sure, she doesn't need to confirm or deny but she also didn't need to tell a straight up lie. and that's why jacqueline brought it up... saying melissa can lie with a straight face all the time and used the plastic surgery as one example"
3841,2020-06-28 03:50:04,hh77pd,She did but everyone screamed BS so loudly she had to admit to that ‚Äúone‚Äù nose job cuz pics like this were circulating. I don‚Äôt get denying such stupid minimal stuff. She fixed her huge nose and it looks better! Just say it...
3842,2020-06-29 04:59:23,hh77pd,"it was season 5. lmao. and then andy being the shady tree that he is... after melissa said it was just contour, he turns to teresa and asks her if she thinks melissa has had a nose job, lmao. he's soooo extra"
3843,2020-06-28 05:51:33,hh77pd,I think there was one or two sprinkled into the reunion also lmao
3844,2020-06-28 17:43:05,hh77pd,Doesn‚Äôt that compromise the actual bone?

3847,2020-06-27 21:44:21,hh1zhh,"Nice collection,  I love it. How do you like the victoria secret fragrances? I want to try them out. I have the bombshell and tease mist and I am thinking of buying the bombshell perfume and trying out their other fragrances."
3848,2020-06-28 00:19:48,hh1zhh,You must be that girl who passes and I just struggle not to fall in love because of the scent trail

3852,2020-06-27 23:57:58,hh1zhh,"How is marc jacobs dot? I ordered it last week, but sadly it hasn't arrived yet :("
3853,2020-06-28 01:54:13,hh1zhh,What do you think of the Parfum de marly meliora? I love sweet scents and this was recommended to me but I don‚Äôt want to waste money on it if it isn‚Äôt super long lasting as there‚Äôs no way to sample it in my country :(
3854,2020-06-27 22:36:49,hh1zhh,How do you like Prada d‚Äôiris?
3855,2020-06-28 00:49:59,hh1zhh,What are your top 3 scents?

3861,2020-11-06 02:24:20,hh1zhh,Hi! Do you have any thoughts on how your Oribe smells compared to the Oribe texturizing spray?
3862,2020-06-27 22:47:33,hh1zhh,Ah thank you!
3863,2020-06-27 21:50:26,hh1zhh,"Thank you! Fabulous and Scandalous I like the most, especially Fabulous. The first time I smelled it I had to get it. It was like I had tunnel vision for a few days lol but honestly, all of them smell lovely and you can't really go wrong with what you pick. It will moreso come down to what you prefer wearing given the event, whether it be work or date or hanging out with friends."
3864,2020-06-28 08:18:44,hh1zhh,Bombshell perfume is lovely! I get SOOO many compliments. Sillage is oküòä
3865,2020-06-28 01:21:59,hh1zhh,"Haha, i would definitely say when I wear Fancy by Jessica Simpson the boys notice lol fancy is like a guy magnet, very sweet and pretty smelling"
3866,2020-06-27 22:15:10,hh1zhh,"You might like it if you like musky powdery scents. It has deep sensual vibe to it. It last pretty long on me and even longer on clothing and people will definitely notice it on you. It does have a nice flowery touch to round out the musk. I would recommend it if you want a scent that packs a punch lol, but I would advise not to spray too much. 
I think there's a three piece set, the Narciso Rodriguez ""for her mini spray perfume trio set"", that has the edt, pure musc and fleur musc in it at .33oz. I would recommend trying that first before comitting to a full bottle you might not like, that way if you dont like it, the others may work out :)"
3867,2020-06-27 22:31:28,hh1zhh,I know this is weird but I have a Google Doc to track the next ones I want lol up next is a few from Etat Libre d'Orange. I had a sample once that came in a gift set and I really liked the smell but I lost it and can't remember which one it was.  I only remembered the logo and started searching. I hear great things about it though so I'm excited to try them out.
3868,2020-06-27 22:26:38,hh1zhh,Thank you!
3869,2020-06-28 01:20:53,hh1zhh,"It's a nice light summery fragrance, admittedly, i like the bottle more than the perfume. It doesn't stand out above Daisy or Honey for me personally, but it's still a good scent nonetheless. It's very crisp. Sillage is kinda low unless you spray a good bit but I would still recommend it. What type of fragrances do you tend to like?"
3870,2020-06-28 04:14:41,hh1zhh,"Meliora smells like what I would imagine rasberry with red currant champagne could smell like. It's effervescent and elegant. One thing you don't have to worry about with Parfum de Marly is longevity, they last pretty long, especially if you spray on your clothes as well. I got about 5-6 hours or so with it before just being a skinscent.
 I liked Meliora better than Delina which seems to be the favorite. I would also recommend Cassili since you love sweet scents, Cassili is tad sweeter and more playful where Meliora is a more mature sweet."
3871,2020-06-27 22:45:54,hh1zhh,"For me, it has nice fresh citrus, almost aquatic, scent. It leans a tiny bit masculine imo but in a soft way. It's great for warm weather as well since it's so light and green. It is one of their most popular ones so I would start there before trying the others. I bought this for my mom (48), who doesnt really like fragrances and just uses the scent of her deodorant and lotion, and it was a hit for her."
3872,2020-06-28 01:24:28,hh1zhh,"1. Marchesa D'extase for sure. 
2. Miss Dior
3. D&G #3 L'imperatrice 

(Tocca Stella battles for the third spot sometimes, but if I had to only wear three perfumes for the rest of my life it would be those three)"
3873,2020-06-28 08:49:03,hh1zhh,"Fancy is so delicious and warm. It's a beautiful blend of caramel and vanilla, sweet, but not sickly sweet. It's definitely a crowd pleaser, I've gotten more compliments wearing it than some of the more expensive high end perfumes. It's projection is really good and it lasts long on me. It's a very feminine pretty scent that may surprise you in how well rounded it is. It reminds me of sugar cookies and bakeries. Definitely one of the better celebrity scents out there! Depending on how fresh your bottle is it may start out strong and harsh, but it levels out quickly into a smooth sweet drydown. I would recommend it if you like the sweeter gourmand fragrances :)"
3874,2020-07-30 20:44:01,hh1zhh,"Both perform very well imo, i actually just picked up a couple more peng lai samples (not ready to commit to full bottle yet) since the juice is so worth it!"
3875,2020-08-09 07:11:24,hh1zhh,"They are incredibly different. They don't overlap at all. Oui is more of an ""eau fraiche"" type scent, it's very different from the rest of their line (something many juicy fans dislike). 
I would get both for two reasons: 1. Because both are great scents that are much different from eachother, Oui could be a daytime fun fresh scent whereas L'imperatrice could be worn to the more nicer events or extra special days and 2. Oui is a unique outlier in the juicy line, you can guarantee that it won't be like getting a viva la juicy flanker and L'imperatrice is the female favorite among the D&G Anthology so a great add to your rotation"
3876,2020-11-11 23:39:01,hh1zhh,"Oh im sorry, ive never smelled the texturizing spray, I'm not familiar with their hair line, but i will say the Oribe leans very masculine and heavy"
3877,2020-06-27 22:42:23,hh1zhh,Lol I have a google doc filled with my 10 designers for life and other tag video ideas from YouTube I like to do for myself. And I have my whole collection cataloged on  the google sheets; it only has the brand and name and approximate cost though.
3878,2020-06-28 05:59:02,hh1zhh,Thanks so much for the detailed reply! I‚Äôll look into cassili too

3880,2020-11-13 03:03:31,hh1zhh,Thank you so much for the response! :) One more q for you--how's the longevity of it?
3881,2020-06-27 22:51:31,hh1zhh,"Ok so I'm not alone lol, Who are your 10 designers?"
3882,2020-08-10 02:14:24,hh1zhh,"NP, let me know what you think of them after you get them, hope you like them!"
3883,2020-06-27 22:56:32,hh1zhh,"Haha that‚Äôs an ongoing debate with myself. But if I had to answer now they‚Äôd be:
1. Lanc√¥me hypnose homme
2. Jean Paul gaultier Le Male
3. Bleu de Chanel Parfum
4. Chanel allure homme edition Blanche
5. Dior eau sauvage parfum 
6. Dior homme parfum
7. Dolce & Gabbana The One
8. Thierry Mugler Angel Men
9. Paco Rabanne One Million Ansolutely Gold
10. Alain Delon Iquitos"
3884,2020-06-27 23:29:21,hh1zhh,"These are all great picks, i love Blue de Chanel and Paco Rabanne. I haven't smelled hypnose yet, is it a good gift? I'm trying to get the bf into fragrance. I got him blue de chanel but it's collecting dust. Maybe something else would grab his interest more."
3885,2020-06-27 23:36:11,hh1zhh,"Hypnose is kinda old now but it‚Äôs one of my milestone scents that changed the way I thought about fragrances. If he wasn‚Äôt diggin on BDC that much, I‚Äôd say Dolce & Gabbana the one would be the opposite in style but still a very crowd pleasing and easy to like scent."
3886,2020-06-27 23:42:03,hh1zhh,Ok I'll try that for him! Thanks for the recommendation

That might be the reason you went through it so you can be the spokesperson for the ones now in abuse.

3902,2020-08-19 16:30:24,icqxx8,You should seriously start a class action law suit and sue this place and report them to the feds
3903,2020-08-19 17:18:46,icqxx8,Dude it sounds like The Handmaids Tale.
3904,2020-08-19 18:26:41,icqxx8,"Thank you for having the strength to post this. You are far stronger than words can express for having the fortitude to survive this horror, and I hope you are able to find a way to help your sister.

I'd like to crosspost this in one of the exxitor subs, because there are several cults (including the one my parents were on the outer fringes of) that have been accused of running ""conversion therapy"" concentration camps like this."
3905,2020-08-19 18:34:56,icqxx8,"There's a sub for other survivors of the ""Troubled Teens"" Industry. /r/troubledteens.

**EDIT**: Please excuse my comment, I didn't see your post history that you already were there. My apologies!"
3906,2020-08-19 20:27:11,icqxx8,"I want to throw up. Places like this are torture and I sincerely hope you can get your sister out. I would contact CPS if you can. Hell, if it was my sibling, they would be coming home with me one way or another. I hope you leave your parents to rot in a nursing home like they deserve and live for yourself."
3907,2020-08-19 19:40:52,icqxx8,"Omg! If this is the school I'm thinking of (also Missouri - surely there can't be too many?), they actually tried to recruit my dad as a teacher. We (as a family) did a tour of the place and they were showing around all proud...they even showed us a giant manure pit and said sometimes when kids needed a physical outlet/correction they'd send them there to work it out. If my dad accepted, me and my siblings would have had to attend the school. My parents got really bad vibes from the place, so he turned it down (thank goodness!). Later found out one of my dad's friends actually sent his son there for a few months and it seriously hurt him mentally! He was older than me so I didn't really talk to him, but I remember he came back with a huge bald spot on the back of his head and there were lots of whispers about how horrible that place was."
3908,2020-08-19 18:43:53,icqxx8,"I'm really sorry that happened to you. I have never been to one of these places myself but I've done a lot of research into the phenomenon because I wanted to find some way to raise awareness they were a thing. I ended up writing my last essay in university on them because it had to be presented at the end in front of the class. I covered the history, background and methods of these places as well as the politicians most to blame for their existence (Not just by inaction, in the like direct-ties sort of way). Your story sounds very much typical for the people who've suffered under these institutions.        

If it helps, as of January 2020 Utah has put in some strict regulations to limit the ability of these places to operate in the region. While as you pointed out these places can absolutely get around laws by shutting down and springing up under different names, this is still important because until then Utah was one of only two states where that wasn't necessary because there were zero regulations at all. If you're interested in looking at other survivor groups and info pages [WWASP Survivors](http://wwaspsurvivors.com/) is one that's still functioning. They have a facebook too, though I haven't gone through that like I have the website."
3909,2020-08-19 20:40:12,icqxx8,"You're definitely not alone. I spent 16 months in one of these programs, I was so relieved to be free of that place, but it was incredibly lonely experience trying to reconnect with real world and feeling like no one could understand what I've been through. The emotional trauma is still something I'm healing from, and it was (mostly) hands off facility.

 I am so sorry you and your sister were put through this. I'm sorry parents don't listen to you. Do they allow you any contact with her? My little sister wrote me every single day when I was in the program, and  it really kept me sane."
3910,2020-08-19 22:15:10,icqxx8,"One of my exes (gay male) went to a school JUST LIKE THIS. I‚Äôm so sorry you endured this. The stories he told me were horrifying and also very similar. Paris Hilton was actually his classmate really briefly until she ran away TWICE from the facility. It was a place rich people sent their kids who they didn‚Äôt wanna parent anymore. It‚Äôs now a registered cult and has since been shut down.

Edit: oh shit I just got to the last paragraph, yeah it‚Äôs awesome of her to speak out. Hopefully women like her and Britney can shed light on the abuse they suffered so people can better understand what it‚Äôs like to be held as hostages"
3911,2020-08-19 20:00:07,icqxx8,"I read stories about these camps. From what I understand, ""gay conversion"" has been banned in most states? Can you call the police and tell them what happened with your sister? I don't think it's legal to do that.

Sorry you had to go through this, it is absolutely insane."
3912,2020-08-19 16:34:13,icqxx8,I agree. I'm no Christian but I sure as hell know that's not in favour of Jesus. That place is a bunch of fucking assholes pretending to play good Samaritan. Oh and you know what would be a kicker to schools like these? Getting footage of what they do inside.

3916,2020-08-19 19:59:06,icqxx8,"Hahah. Well. One of the sad things is, a lot of schools are in Missouri because they don‚Äôt have laws protecting children. So if A child wants to leave, they have no say. In other states, a child can‚Äôt be held against their will."
3917,2020-08-19 19:54:11,icqxx8,Hey. It does mean a lot to me that even college students have heard about this. I really appreciate you doing that essay in college. It makes me hopeful that sooner than later these kinds of programs and how abusive they are will be common knowledge.

She went to a place called Provo CANYON School. Pare t if rich enough can have people come to your house in the middle of the night and take you and place you anywhere. In 2005 a girl named Ashley Deboer almost died there and ended up on life support for 2 weeks. I was sodomized there and starved among other abuses. You have minimal contact with the outside world.

She attended a boarding school in Utah as a teen that was highly abusive as are most of the programs in that industry. As someone who spent several year in those places they are highly abusive and detrimental to the well being of those placed in the programs. I would encourage everyone to look at the [r/troubledteens](https://www.reddit.com/r/troubledteens/)

Maybe she‚Äôll surprise us and prove doubts wrong with her whole ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt really know me‚Äù selling point behind this."

4008,2020-08-18 16:17:09,ic37sv,I doubt she'll go there.  I think those relationships are so enmeshed and dysfunctional.  I would guess Kathy keeps a tight leash on all things dealing with Big Kathy and how they grew up.

I hate this idea of ppl buying into her attempts to whitewash her shitty behaviour and pull the woe is me, I'm a misunderstood and complex girl who just happened to be born into a wealthy family. Lots of people are born into wealthy families and they don't and will never pull the kinda stunts and racist crap she has pulled and im not here for her bogus redemption doc which is just a ploy for her to strive for some sort of relevancy. Go home, Paris. You're a forty year old adult with a mentality of a bratty 15 year old. I feel sorry about her abuse, but she's been such a trashy and terrible person throughout I won't accept it as some excuse to feel bad for her. I feel empathy for her situation but nothing more beyond that."

4045,2020-09-07 07:20:26,inxptf,"I like unusual names but Paris is just too out there and loaded imo. If it was just the literature references it would be fine for me, but with Paris, France; Paris DuPree (Paris is Burning) and Paris Hilton it is too complicated for me. Somehow all the references give me an overall impression of tacky pink, fabulous and camp. Which is not neutral for a boy. It would be a great name to choose for yourself as an adult if it was too suit you."

But that's why I said it all depends, even if people don't know her she did kind of make naming a girl Paris more common so because of her there are a lot more named that, but it's all up to you, talk to your close circle, that's who will really influence your child, then whatever choice you make just own it & teach your child to be proud & own it :)"
4052,2020-09-07 04:03:31,inxptf,"She's known for being a bit vacuous, aloof, and off in her own poor-little-rich-girl land. But apparently, abundant economic privilege aside, she's suffered a really hard life and there is a tell-all documentary coming out soon. She's interesting. I wouldn't be surprised if she played up a persona just to bank on it, to be honest. She comes from a family of savvy businessfolk. People also loved to hate her because she owned her sexuality and didn't really give a shit about being slut-shamed. She had a sleazy ex boyfriend release a sex tape without her consent so people hate on her for that, which is unfortunate, as she's a victim there. But yeah, she didn't really play up a likable persona...just a persona which people would talk about, you know?"
4053,2020-09-07 01:19:15,inxptf,"She's mostly linked to some hotel chain and the Kardashians I think.  I remember her being SUPER famous when I was young but not really famous FOR anything in particular haha.  I don't really follow any celebraties though and 99.9% of the time I haven't heard of any that people are talking about, so the fact that *I've* heard her name means she was super famous and the name may bring images of her to people's mind haha!

As to Paris, I'd more commonly think of it as a boys name too, but upon looking it up it's surprisingly about 3/4 of the time used for girls.  I think it's been growing a lot in popularity but could be wrong on that."

4064,2020-09-06 19:19:16,inlzgl,"I love how Police Squad parodied this.

they had a guest actor every episode, who was killed **during the opening credits as it said their name** and never seen again in the episode.

like it would say ""guest starring William Shatner!"" and show a close up of his character drinking from a wine glass, who then falls over dead from poison."

4069,2020-09-06 16:31:28,inlzgl,The recaps before an episode can be annoying. I watch them to generally refresh myself from what happened the week before but when they put an actor in the recap who hasn't been on the show in sometime it always ruins the surprise.
4070,2020-09-06 22:08:00,inlzgl,"There is a Doctor Who series from the early 70s which is a great example of a show spoiling itself.  The Doctor meets some shipwrecked survivors on an alien planet.  They are fighting an invisible enemy,  which is revealed at the end of episode one in dramatic and shocking fashion to be the Daleks.

At least it would have been dramatic and shocking..if the series wasn't called Planet of the Daleks.."
4071,2020-09-06 17:31:44,inlzgl,"Supernatural is also bad for that with the previously on. Like when they show the Trickster to remind you of him and it's like hmm I wonder what's going to happen.

I think one of the best moments on avoiding this was X-Files they had an episode where in the last 10 or 15 seconds a major antagonist showed up who had been believed to be dead at that point and as it cut to black it said ""Also starring William B. Davis"" who played the character."

4075,2020-09-06 19:13:23,inlzgl,"I normally don't care about this sort of thing, but sometimes it can completely make or break a reveal. 

I remember back in 2007 or 2008, I was watching Heros, and there was an episode where Christopher Eccleston (who was my favorite Doctor at the time) shows up as the Invisible Man, and George Takei shows up as Masi Oka's slightly evil father. I have never had a more extreme reaction to guest stars in just about anything. I was still riding a wave of excitement when the second one showed up and completely kicked it into high gear. 

This moment would have been completely ruined if either had been revealed ahead of time."

All of the actors who played the previous 6 Big Bad's from the 6 previous seasons all had a cameo at the very end of the episode.

4082,2020-09-06 18:55:50,inlzgl,"I think it‚Äôs mostly down to SAG union rules governing the order of credits. Guest stars are different from the rest of the single-episode cast, so they get credited up front where it‚Äôs more prestigious, rather than at the end where fewer people see it.

There‚Äôs all sorts of exceptions that get made to those rules, but it often comes down to PR, so unless the actor agrees to have her name at the end, it‚Äôs gonna be shown up front. So, I guess, blame Paris Hilton and her agent for insisting on spoiling the reveal by having her credit up front."

4088,2020-09-06 21:44:05,inlzgl,"Just reminded me of another thing that annoys me, kinda when they do the opposite I guess. 

There‚Äôs an episode of Torchwood (4x01) where one of the characters (Rex) is on the phone investigating a member of Torchwood (Gwen) and has their phone taken off them. IIRC it was a woman‚Äôs hand who took the phone.

Later in the episode, it‚Äôs revealed that another Torchwood member (Jack) took the phone from Rex and his hand looks all different because you can see his vortex manipulator on his wrist along with a blue sleeve. Totally different shots.

They should‚Äôve just used the shot of Jack‚Äôs arm for both shots. If the viewer notices it then they know a little about what happened, otherwise it‚Äôll be revealed later.

Doctor Who did this right where in 5x06 (i think) the Doctor leaves Amy and he‚Äôs not wearing his jacket but then the Doctor comes up to talk to her and he is wearing a jacket. That‚Äôs because he‚Äôs time travelling back from 5x13."

This typically isn't true at all. they play tv shows faster on television to make the runing time shorter. not a noticeable amount, but if you were watching it side by side at 1x speed you'd see that the pitch of the sound was a little high and it was a little fast. 

precisely so that they can air even more commercials per hour by running shows at faster than real time.

Internet is the wrong example for this. Internet started with the United States Department of Defense as ARPANet which I think was a closed network. They then incorporated packet switching into ARPANet. Packet switching was developed independently by both the UK Govt & also by RAND Corp, a non-profit. In the beginning, only universities, govt depts in the US connected to ARPANet. Then universities etc started connecting internationally. Commercial providers came only in the late 80s on the internet (MCI Mail, Compuserve, AmericaOnline). The internet then wasn't as we know it know it now. There was no HTML, no Browsers & no HTTP. Tim Berners-Lee developed all three - he is called the father of the World Wide Web (WWW). Tim Berners-Lee worked for CERN when he did this. CERN was funded by a collaboration of European Govts.

He doesn't know what he's saying. Private property is the means of production as property. The means of production are the instruments of production (e.g. throwing spear, fishing net) + subject of production (e.g. the jungle they lived on). The instruments of production were literally too few in number to be personally owned at the time, and the subject (land) has always been owned by the tribe as a whole. He might have read about some guy clinging to his plate or his loincloth very stubbornly, and deduced that they had a sense of private property from that.

By far and away the simplest way of understanding that the old tribes had no private property is the fact that they have no sense of marriage. Where there is property, there is always marriage.

Marx never said that old societies didn't have gradients for capitalism. He said they weren't capitalist. His points haven't opposed that meaningfully."

Best thing to do is hover over the video you don't want recommended to you on the homepage and click the three dots. From there you'll see the options 'Not interested' and 'Don't recommend channel.""

Usually doing not interested works, but if it's the same channel that is getting recommended block the channel.

4311,2020-10-10 14:28:10,j8kkw8,"I worked at PCS from 90-91 before quitting and going to work at Heritage just down the road. She‚Äôs not lying.

Edit: I quit because it was a locked facility and my coworkers were just mean. Heritage was an open campus but it still was a bit shit. I worked in the unit that dealt with more violent kids and it was not uncommon to bum rush these kids and strap them to a bed and give them a ‚Äúpeanut butter‚Äù shot. That‚Äôs a sedation shot that feels like slow moving peanut butter hitting up your veins till you pass out. 

I couldn‚Äôt take that either and so ended up working with kids in their school program. I used to get anxiety and nausea just driving to work. Plus my boss Dan was an absolute fucking prick.

I used to get scolded for not being strict enough like once I let a kid stay up and talk with us about how he was trying to understand his life and what he wanted to really do. Nope. i‚Äôll never forget Dan‚Äôs words when he walked into the living room.  ‚ÄúYou...go to bed or go to Unit 8 and you... you‚Äôre not here to be anybody‚Äôs friend. Do the job or leave.‚Äù"
4312,2020-10-10 17:46:25,j8kkw8,"Abuse in these places is 100% real. I went to West Ridge (though it was called the Boys Ranch at the time). I saw shit that took me years to get over. There was always that kid who would say ""I'm going to expose this place for what it is"", and then that never happens because they moved on or didn't have the resources. What Paris Hilton is doing is the dream of anyone who has experienced that kind of abuse, exposing it.

West Ridge was also heavily invested in and subsidized by the church, and even has a Mormon church onsite. Knowing the ""all knowing"" church was giving to such an abusive facility had a massive impact on my decision to leave, we had no CES Letter, Mormon Stories, or Gospel Topic Essays back then."

4315,2020-10-10 19:22:47,j8kkw8,"Look at the book Saving Alex by Alex Cooper and Joanna Brooks.

Raised in the Mormon Church, Cooper was always a rebellious teenager. With her Mormon friends, she snuck out of her parents' house, smoked marijuana, and talked back. None of these actions caused much drama in her household, but when the high school sophomore admitted to her parents that the hickey on her neck was from a girl, their family life exploded. Told that she was going to live with her grandparents, Cooper instead was sent to a residential home in St. George, UT, where she was mentally and physically abused in order to ""fix"" her homosexuality. With the assistance of caring teachers and friends, Cooper legally escaped the respected Mormon family who were trying to ""cure"" her, and a Salt Lake City pro bono lawyer helped her win the right to live with her parents as an openly gay teenager. 

There is a Mormon Stories interview with Alex Cooper."
4316,2020-10-10 18:47:12,j8kkw8,"‚Äú...While we acknowledge there are individuals over the many years who believe they were not helped by the program, we are heartened by the many stories former residents share about how their stay was a pivot point in improving ‚Äì and in many cases, saving ‚Äì their lives.""

What fresh horseshit is this. I‚Äôm not surprised that they‚Äôre denying the allegations, and even less surprised that they‚Äôre ‚Äúsubtly‚Äù attacking the credibility of the claimants, but to put such self-congratulatory garbage in there as well? That‚Äôs lower than the bottom of the barrel."
4317,2020-10-10 14:08:43,j8kkw8,"I had a mission comp who was sent to one of these places down by Hurricane, (HUR-uh-ken). He escaped a few times. I dont remember him mentioning any abuse but he did say once he stopped trying to escape and just buckled down it was pretty easy."

4319,2020-10-10 16:37:35,j8kkw8,"The Tribune did an article about these teen programs. I learned that the facility that I worked at for 5 years is owned by the parent company that owns Provo Canyon (Benchmark Behavioral in Woods Cross). I can confirm that they are environments that are ripe with different abuses. At least two women that I worked with directly lost their jobs for inappropriate conduct. Several guys were fired for physical abuses. 

Granted there were kids there that absolutely needed to be there through either their anti social behaviors or adjudicated because of sex offenses. Patients would attack each other daily. 

It had been years after the fact that I first read about the Stanford prison study, the parallels were eye opening. 

Though I was slowly going through my faith transition while working here, the program, workers, therapists, and administrators alike where not at all heavily LDS influenced. It was the first time that i had several LQBQT+ coworkers, and what sculpted my feelings about them. There were a few kids there whose families where Mormon, one time one of the kids was reading the BOM I made a flippant comment to him that if he really needed help going to sleep there were easier ways like the nurse giving him something. He tried convincing me that it was a great book. Amongst our conversation he stoped and asked ‚ÄúWait are you Mormon?‚Äù It was one of the first times that I realized that I wasn‚Äôt projecting my Mormonism."

Sometimes he would brag about some of the physically violent ways they would control unruly boys. It was a turn off to me. I also knew a few college students that worked there as dorm monitors. They also said the same kind of things."

So disturbing."
4325,2020-10-11 02:49:41,j8kkw8,"As a former employee of just over 20 years, I did not sense an overtly Mormon influence, just a business atmosphere.  Some of my associates were active LDS but I did not sense a LDS culture there, more worldly.  I worked for the original founders whose philosophy was much more hands on.  When Charter took over more accreditation and licensing was involved so things got softer.  When UHS took over, it didn't change much that I could see.

I worked in support services and not directly with patients, but  
I can attest to a boy ambushing a night watch staff member with a toilet seat to the head, another one sucker punching a counselor in the school hall causing significant bone breakage near his eye, and a student chasing a therapist down the hall with a hammer.  The patients are sent there for for behavioral reasons, but when I saw a movie star's son arrive in a limo to be enrolled it occurred to me that the parents or lack thereof were a significant cause of the youth actions.

I also  witnessed a lot of things I would not approve of from staff and even administrators.  A well liked teacher and I happened to see a boy escape to a nearby area and we followed.  The teacher and I cornered him from a distance and the teacher had him talked down and ready to return with us just as a carload of other staff members arrived and one charged right in and tackled the student.  Now that I think of it, it might have been Dan mentioned above.  I was disgusted with that behavior but my later protests had no result.  One new administrator spent all his time re-decorating the buildings.  Another thought it would be fun to throw old computer monitors off the roof into the loading dock to watch what would happen.

If you stick around  business long enough you will see a lot of strange things.  I won't comment on the Paris Hilton thing, she was just another one of the girls when I was there and I know nothing of her experience.  I however considered the girls program director at the time to be a dour type with her personal clique of assistants  who gave me the deer in the headlights look when I needed to interact with her.  To me the girls did not easily offer a caring attitude."

4350,2020-10-09 12:59:51,j7y2th,"Jesus.  That's way past narcissism and straight up psychopath.   Making fun of your child's sexual assault?  I'm relatively even-keeled, though a bit snippy, but I might have just decked him.  You have amazing self-restraint, no matter what that absolute black hole of a person says.  Next time he starts in on that, fucking record him.  Play it for anyone who doesn't believe that he's a dumpster fire pretending to be a human.  Fuck.

Sorry that you have to go through this, it's a travesty."
4351,2020-10-09 12:56:58,j7y2th,They do tend to act like children to get their own way sadly but at least next time you know better and you figured out their pattern and that makes me proud of you as an internet stranger!
4352,2020-10-09 14:00:20,j7y2th,At the end part on when he made you snap what did your mom and sister say and if I were you and kept trying to make me snap like that I would put in my headphones and block him out with angsty music
4353,2020-10-09 17:34:58,j7y2th,"Yep, they write a terrible narrative about you, and then push and push and push your buttons until you finally (and reasonably) snap, and then they point to your reaction as proof of their narrative. It‚Äôs happened to me thousands of times. It is a tactic they use. 

It‚Äôs really hard not to react, but it‚Äôs what they want. The best you can do is stay away from them. If you can‚Äôt get away from him, as soon as he starts in on you, walk away - go to where there are bystanders and they can see him acting the way he is so he embarrasses himself. They hate looking the fool"
4354,2020-10-09 14:12:43,j7y2th,"He is jealous of you, he always tries to bring you down so he can feel better about himself, that really sad, sometimes when my dad tells me that I am a piece of shit I just ignore him and go outside in the park to exercise. You cant do anything about his behaviour, just try to not pay attention to his words. BELIEVE ME it helps your mental state, a lot."
4355,2020-10-09 18:06:09,j7y2th,"Wow, he sounds like straight-up garbage and your mom and sister are oblivious at best and enablers at worst. I'd never talk to him again."
4356,2020-10-09 20:03:03,j7y2th,they behave like elementary school kids because that's their emotional age.
4357,2020-10-09 20:48:59,j7y2th,I'm sorry he treats you like this we've all been in these types of abusive situations. I really hope that your family sees his idiocy for what it is but you didn't say whether they believe him or you.
4358,2020-10-10 01:23:28,j7y2th,"Maybe um...maybe bring this up with a therapist or school guidance counselor (I dunno your age) but it seems like just not responding at all pisses him off the most. So, my suggestion is...record it the next time. Do not react. Just record how he acts and quickly send it to a friend for evidence because if he can take your phone, he will probably delete it and gaslight you or others into believing its not true. You can either use this to contact CPS with and idk make your dad go to court mandated therapy because JESUS FUCK THIS DUDE NEEDS IT."
4359,2020-10-09 21:54:03,j7y2th,"Thank you. These couple days have definitely been hard for me, with the self-blame and depression, but I guess the good that came out of it was that I stumbled upon this sub and found out that I wasn't alone! It's so weird, but knowing that someone else would've gotten angry at him if they were in my shoes made me feel better as if now I definitely know that I'm not crazy lol. So thank you"
4360,2020-10-09 21:10:19,j7y2th,"I actually made another post before this about it, but basically my mom and sister were upset at me for my outburst. My sister said me being snarky and mean didn't help the situation and my mom said that I was just like my father.... So I guess my dad got what he wanted in the end LOL. It's okay because I was being really mean and snarky so they were right."
4361,2020-10-09 21:44:26,j7y2th,"That's actually something I'm still trying to figure out. I didn't know enablers were a thing until recently because its always just been about my dad. My mom and sister also get abused too, just not as much, so I figured we all understood each other. However, I've been noticing a pattern of them just blaming me for his outbursts like ""why did you keep talking,"" or ""if you hadn't done that, you would've been fine."" They would try to help calm him down for the first 5 minutes or so but then after that they would just watch and stay quiet. Normally though, they would complain about my dad with me and agree that he sucks, so I don't know if they are enabling or not.and if so, what I should do about it."
4362,2020-10-09 21:32:38,j7y2th,"My family sees the idiocy and understood that he instigated since they did see everything unfold, but they seemed more disappointed that I gave in and made things worse with my outburst. My mom would often tell me that my dad is just like that and there's nothing we can do about it, but we should instead learn to forget what he did to us in our past and become unaffected by his words, as if it's that easy. So with that mentality, they blamed me for snapping back and not him for pushing me because I should've known he was horrible and I should've been stronger. To be honest, I still don't know whether or not they're right. On the one hand, it's impossible for him to change and therefore we should just learn to live with it until we escape and move out. But on the other hand, I can only be so strong..."
4363,2020-10-10 01:43:04,j7y2th,"LOL I'm actually 23 so I'm a bit passed the age where I have access to a school guidance counselor. At the same time, because of the pandemic, I can't fully be independent and move out, so I have been forced to follow his rules, which means no therapy. It's a really sticky situation...

 I've actually been doing exactly what you suggested. I record him and send bits and pieces to my boyfriend (not all, because I didn't want to traumatize him) to just have some kind of evidence of it. I once showed my dad three years worth of footage of him just berating our entire family, and he tried to say that I was threatening to ruin his life, and if I call the police, then I would be destroying my family. It's so ridiculous it's almost laughable at this point."
4364,2020-10-10 02:42:17,j7y2th,Alright here's what you are going to do if they think you are soooo bad then distance yourself from grey rock them! Listen to music because I don't know about you but my music 9/10 keeps my emotions in check
4365,2020-10-10 05:51:31,j7y2th,"I'm sorry about mistaking your age I'm not sure why but I imagined a teenager.
 So you showed him evidence of him being an abusive dick and it didn't like snap anything for him? Make him see the light? The fact he told you that you'd ruin the family if you CALLED THE POLICE says that he knows what he's doing is wrong. Jesus, dude I am sorry you have to deal with this shit. It sounds like your dad Is only ever happy when he has someone to torment."
4366,2020-10-09 00:21:00,j7otla,"I really like the light serialization of season 6. 6-8 are arguably the best, though 9 and 10 also have a lot of top tier episodes. There‚Äôs been great episodes in recent seasons too, though, usually involving the kids. Put It Down, Grounded Vindaloop, the Scott Malkinson episode"
4367,2020-10-09 12:47:38,j7otla,"Season 11. This season has the most episodes that I'd rate 10/10. 9 episodes out of 14. D-Yikes! is the only episode in the season that I don't like. 

The episodes I'd rate 10/10 in S11 are:

With Apologies to Jesse Jackson

Cartman Sucks

Night of the Living Homeless

Le Petit Tourette

Imaginationland trilogy

Guitar Queer-o

The List"
4368,2020-10-09 00:25:03,j7otla,Easily 13. Season 13 is peak south park.
4369,2020-10-09 01:33:28,j7otla,"I think I have to agree with you and say season 8. However, 6, 9 and 10 are close contenders."
4370,2020-10-09 00:27:57,j7otla,Season 1-4. In that order.
4371,2020-10-09 00:17:34,j7otla,"Season 6. Professor Chaos, Simpsons Already Did It, Red Hot Catholic Love, Child Abduction Is Not Funny, The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers..."

4374,2020-10-09 03:00:35,j7otla,"My favorites are Seasons 5-11. Besides Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina and The Return of Chef, I don't think there's a single episode that I don't like."
4375,2020-10-09 01:12:17,j7otla,Whatever season Scott Tenorman is.
4376,2020-10-09 13:57:43,j7otla,Le petit Tourette is my all time favorite. 11 is a good one too.
4377,2020-10-09 04:15:29,j7otla,That is a great fucking season tbh.
4378,2020-10-08 21:26:09,j7lhe3,I thought she was the Elle Woods wannabe? She‚Äôs a serial doppelg√§nger
4379,2020-10-09 05:09:40,j7lhe3,I see (bear with me here) Jeffree Starr; their mannerisms are almost identical!
4380,2020-10-08 22:37:46,j7lhe3,"After watching This is Paris, I can say that she‚Äôs possibly aiming to be a copy of the character Paris plays, but she is no Paris... I have a lot of new found respect for Paris"
4381,2020-10-08 21:11:04,j7lhe3,I absolutely dislike Kameron so much. She‚Äôs definitely a Paris wannabe. She wishes
4382,2020-10-08 21:33:56,j7lhe3,Whenever I see Kameron I think of Nicole Kidman. (Appearance only.)
4383,2020-10-09 20:37:02,j7lhe3,"Yeah, the dumb blonde ‚Äúpink as a personality‚Äù is so dated!"
4384,2020-10-09 16:23:47,j7lhe3,Kameron may think she‚Äôs Paris but she‚Äôs barely a Nicole
4385,2020-10-09 18:48:32,j7lhe3,I think she looks more like Nicole Kidman
4386,2020-10-09 16:12:16,j7lhe3,I love Kameron. She 100% plays a super exaggerated character on the show just like Paris did on the Simple Life. I've seen a couple interviews with her where she does not have the voice inflection and dumb blonde persona at all. But I think that the character works well on the show.
4387,2020-10-08 22:01:40,j7lhe3,same
4388,2020-10-09 18:49:21,j7lhe3,LOL!!!!
4389,2020-10-09 20:36:21,j7lhe3,You see it too!!?!?!
4390,2020-10-09 00:49:01,j7lhe3,"Yesss thank you!! My sister judges me so hard on my new found stance and respect on Paris, but honestly that documentary really changed my perspective on her. Like I feel like we finally saw the real her and it was so good to see that other side of her. The raw emotions and obvious intelligence she has. I do hope she gets to a real happy place sometime soon in life. She seems so sweet and deserves the happiness life has to offer!"
4391,2020-10-09 05:57:01,j7lhe3,Ok but for real like #FreeParis. The shit Kathy and Rick did to her as a kid was disgusting.
4392,2020-10-08 21:15:52,j7lhe3,I have to agree. It‚Äôs hard to even warm to her because it all seems like an act
4393,2020-10-09 18:49:43,j7lhe3,The mouth is identical
4394,2020-10-09 13:12:06,j7lhe3,They do look alike!

4401,2020-10-08 13:07:05,j7behr,"Honestly, I think the era of making it big on Youtube is over now. No new Youtubers will ever reach the level of Jenna Marbles, David Dobrik, etc. There are far too many creators and far too little original content these days. Celebrities are using the platform to provide free content for their fans, and I think this is going to continue especially since so many people don't buy cable anymore and the production of new shows and movies has essentially come to a standstill for the time being."
4402,2020-10-08 13:50:01,j7behr,"Honestly I'm just happy that they're learning to be somewhat competent with computers.

Celebrities, the big ones, live in a bubble outside of technology. Some still think computers are for nerds and dweebs.

They're uh... not so good with computers. But it's cute to see them try.

No one watches TV like they used to, so it'll be nonsense for them to produce content exclusively for TV.

4414,2020-10-08 10:24:20,j7a2vn,"* Finalists - Qld vs NSW

* Winner - Qld

* Most Runs - Kurtis Patterson

* Most Wickets - Mitch Swepson, can't help but think all the talk of spin recently suggests there may be a directive from CA for drier pitches. Mitch warmed up for the shield last weekend taking a handy 7/47 for Sandgate-Redcliffe. Just have a feeling it's his year.

* Young Players 

* Xavier Bartlett - Debuted last year and took 12 wickets in the 3 matches he played including a 5fer. I suspect he will get the first go as Qld's third choice quick with Blake Edwards to possibly rotate in and play a handful of matches, which leads me to my next player.

* Blake Edwards - Imo an even better prospect than Bartlett, Edwards has been absolutely terrorising Qld premier sides taking 135 wickets at 19 in the last 3 and a bit seasons.

* Bryce Street - Duh, the fucking Wall

* Will Sutherland - He's going to be a great bowler, but I think he will show us what he has with the bat this season. Just made 157 in the Victorian Intra squad match last week. I don't think he will be known as ""James's son"" or "" Annabelle's brother"" in 5 months time.

* Players getting back in Aus contention

* Kurtis Patterson - His season last year was hampered by injury, but he still managed a 94 not out for Australia A in one of his few games. He's carried that on to this season with a 100 and an 80 in a NSW intra squad match. Season of KPat."
4415,2020-10-08 09:59:28,j7a2vn,"Don't think green will top the run charts, will defs be in the top 5 but if he's on top of the run charts by the time the India series comes around he's gonna be in the bio bubble for the entire season."

4417,2020-10-08 10:36:52,j7a2vn,QLD & NSW should dominate the Adelaide leg with the squads available for these four matches. Should be slightly more even for the post-Xmas leg.

4420,2020-10-08 21:38:35,j7a2vn,"Finalists: NSW vs QLD

Winner: QLD

Most Runs: Nic Maddinson. Expect big runs in the first half of the comp on those small Adelaide decks. He's been an absolute monster the past few years when he's not been out injured, so I'd expect if he stays injury free he will continue to dominate.

Most Wickets: Wes Agar. He's been strong, I wouldn't expect him to take a backwards step and without the Tasmanian or Queensland green top wickets in the first half, his experience on Adelaide wickets should shine above the rest.

Young players to watch: I think we are in for a good season from Jason Sangha if he gets a few cracks. He looks like he has taken his dropping from the side on the chin and come back with a strong Premier cricket record behind him.

Tanveer Sangha is the most interesting man in cricket at the moment because we are all waiting with baited breath to see if we've reeled in another leg spinner who can contest for national selection. It's 100% too early to tell how he performs the hardest skill in the game, but expect a season of bold claims and insane speculation.

Nathan Ellis has been touted by Trent Copeland as a future red ball cricket star and there's no reason not to think that's true. After his nervy first few overs he's looked unstoppable for Tasmania in all formats, and a pre season with the Siddler himself might transform Ellis into a genuine national selection chance. He could even be an outside chance to be amongst the top wicket takers if he gets a chance and impresses for Tasmania early.

Cameron Green is an obvious watch and too much has already been said about him, so I'll change tact and say look out for Aaron Hardie who has sort of flown under the radar a bit with Green's rise to fame. He's already notched up 8 wickets in a match and a defiant lower order century in his 3 FC matches.

Who I'll personally be watching out for: Dan Solway and Henry (Rex) Hunt. Solway has an absolutely whistle clean technique and looks on top of his mental game with the gears to defend and attack when needed. I watch every Rex Hunt innings with the hope that he kicks on and finally ends the merry-go-round of mediocre SA top order bats. Please Henry, just end the torture, have a good season, please I'm begging you."

They would have Cameron Green who could be a future number 5/6 and Sutherland waiting in the wings as all rounders. Hell you could play them both in the same line up as their main skills could be good enough to get in the squad.

4424,2020-10-08 10:11:49,j7a2vn,The first test is supposedly going to be in Adelaide and the first four rounds of the Shield season are being played in Adelaide so I don't think the bio bubble will be much of a concern.
4425,2020-10-08 12:58:05,j7a2vn,"There really are no states that are perennial bridesmaids. At the top end of the spectrum are NSW and Victoria the two most successful teams (think Surrey and Yorkshire) and have recently been successful, NSW are defending champs and Vic one three on the trot not long ago. Queensland and WA do have lots of talent that was fostered at home (although in Queensland's case born abroad) and aren't dominate. South Australia have won two games in three seasons and don't have a lot of exciting talent. Tasmania may be your team though, much like Somerset it's known for its apple production."

the internet so distinctive from other crappy text that I'm ad libbing specifically for this nonsensical paragraph.

Second of all, pointing out my poor grammar is weak like Bush's approval ratings, even though history will clearly show that he was among the best presidents the US has ever had. A badger just humped my leg. Can you believe this crap? Those bastards need to be put in front of a speeding train. 1 stalled for a bit there, but I will keep on writing a block of text so that it may appear as if I have a good point to make and you shall be over whelmed by my return-key-ignoring skills. Resistance is futile! And then, when you attempt to reply to it, you will inevitably neglect some points that I may have made. I shall point this out to you in a lame-ass effort to appear more intelectual and, thus, right. You are lucky that I'm using commas, even though I firmly believe in capital punishment. Your feeble mind cannot begin to comprehend the massive skill and patience that it takes to adlib a big-ass wall of text that you see before you. I would be truly impressed if you have made it this far and, as you can see, you are not even half-way through! You poor soul. Aviator sunglasses is where it's at. Where what is at? And how can something be at sunglasses? wtf does that mean? Unless we're talking about microbes, then nothing else would be fitting. You can't be ""at"" something of that size! Even those big-ass Paris Hilton sunglasses that can cause nuclear winter by blocking the sun. Really, NASA was planning on bringing a pair to shield the space station. But then their toilet broke and they were like ""bah fuck that."" Speaking of fuck that, am I the only one who thinks that today's music sucks ass? I mean I saw some chick singing and i was about to pour motor oil in my ears. Where is today's good music like Boston, AC/DC, or Led Zeppelin? What will be considered today's classic 20 years from now? Oh yea, the world ends in 2012 so it doesnt even matter. What's that? Ah yes the mayans were the shiznit astronomers. As far as astronomy goes, the mayans is where is at, yo! They knew that every 20,000 years, the Earth and the sun line up with the center of the Milky Way. How the hell do you figure that out That's badass. Probably the aliens taught them. But what kind of stupid aliens would teach that? Seriously? Wouldnt they teach something USEFUL like how to make a big block HEMI with a supercharger? That wouldve hauled ass back then! But no, instead they taught them how to figure out when shit lines up in the sky. And so, tic-tac-toe was born. Line up the stars, bitches! The return key feels extremely neglected by now. It misses the touch of my right pinky: Shadow of the Colossus for the PS2 is a bad-ass game. I recommend it. I'm listeningto the soundtrack right now! Bioshock is also the shit, as well as Half Life 2. Anyone who disagrees with this is a vegetarian. And apparently there is something even further than that, people who only eat fruits. I forgot the name but I'm astonished that they exist! More power to them and their leather belts. You're still reading? wow, you get some sort of prize. Like a granola bar or something. How about gum? You like gum? Ice Breakers is where it's at... where the mint is at. Oh, snap! Alright this is the last few lines so let's make it sound serious. The democrats have undoubtedly put this country in the toilet in the short 2 years that they've been in power of Congress! Not to mention that things can indeed go down that fast and don't need years to build up, which is what a bubble is! Your short sightedness is tipical of a liberal pinko commie and you are destroying america with your tolerance for different people, you hippie! If you don't like it, ten you can get out and go to go Canada to munch on some Canadian bacon, EH EH! This is our country

and we will nuke whoever messes with us! USA NUMBER ONE! Corporations ftw, yo!"

Online posting only leads to other translations, and meaningless paragraphs are very limited.

Second, although Bush has openly stated that he is one of the best presidents in American history, my language skills seem to be worse than Bush's. I hit. J! Don't you believe this nonsense? This person must be in front of a high-speed train. I calmed down, but you were surprised by the strategy of not forgetting my password. Opposition is meaningless! When I try to answer, I definitely ignore what I said. I have more intelligence, so please try to show how you look. I was lucky enough to use a dash that could indicate the death penalty. You do not see your soft heart in front of you, and you have begun to acquire the skills and patience needed to fix it on the large text wall. You will be amazed if you go too far. As you can see, the peninsula is gone! Weak soul. Sunglasses There are sunglasses. No? Why something on the sunglasses? what does it mean? We are not good at anything unless we are talking about germs. You cannot ‚Äúdo good‚Äù! Paris Hilton sunglasses can also block sunlight and create a nuclear winter. In fact, NASA intends to bring in a pair to protect the space station. But the toilet is broken, they are hell. ""Hell, I'm the only one. I think today's music is rotten? Have I seen other women singing and trying to absorb oil in their ears (DC or Zeplin)? Will it be normal for 20 years? Yes, the world will end in 2012, so I don't care."" She is a breast of astrology. About astronomy, where is Maya! Earth and sun meet in Tianhe! J! How can you be stupid? Maybe guests taught them. I want to pull the ass! But no, they taught me when dust enters the sky. . So Tick was born. Please resolve in other ways! So far, Yuko login has been forgotten. My finger lost contact. Shadow Colossus is a stupid game for PS2. Recommend I listen to contemporary music! Bioshock is also bad, with ""half life 2"". Everyone who disagrees is a vegetarian. Eat fruit. I forgot his name, but I was surprised! They and the belt have more capacity. J! Still reading? Wow you have a gift, it's like a granola bar. chewing gum? J! Do you like chewing gum? This is a bubble! Your myopia is part of the Pinko free community, tolerates others and destroys your hippos America!

We explode what hurts us! No. 1 America! The company you made, Yo!"

4494,2020-10-07 04:46:55,j6ko4d,"Twitter was a completely unknown entity offering an entirely new service when it launched. No one knew what it was, the whole idea (140-character limit) sounded ridiculously dumb, and the site was plagued by outages. In other words, it took a little while to get off the ground. Early 2009 is when it started to become exponentially more popular, particularly among American celebrities."
4495,2020-10-07 06:02:19,j6ko4d,Worth considering that these people are generally represented by agencies that have lots of clients.  One major agency deciding to make a push of getting their clients onto Twitter (and maybe operating the accounts for them) could bring a bunch of celebrities all at once.
4496,2020-10-07 04:45:50,j6ko4d,Interesting how it dramatically falls in May 2009 before rebounding at a peak around June 2009.

4498,2020-10-07 04:53:23,j6ko4d,"I‚Äôll admit, Biden is surprising to me. Obama had the young, hip, upstart campaign from the jump, so it‚Äôs no surprise that he got on Twitter within a month of declaring his candidacy. But Biden? Somebody on his team was young and prescient."

Nothing like I remember her."
4500,2020-10-06 14:47:53,j64lx5,"Wealthy families stay wealthy by putting tremendous pressure on their children to succeed, while also doing everything they can to aid their children's success. That means providing money and connections, yes. Success becomes a kind of love language, where the children are desperate to please their parents by the only metrics their parents allow. And you can see in the documentary that she was on camera all the time as a child, with one of her parents looking through the viewfinder. That means when Paris sees a horde of paparazzi, she's feeling her parents' ""love"" again.

The documentary shows that she used her fame and status as an heiress to be seen with some very famous people in some very exclusive, high-profile places, and tabloid media elevated her in kind. Her teenage identity -- teenagers often play with identities that aren't very genuine but help them cope with their lives -- became the character she played on The Simple Life, and from there she could just repeatedly leverage fame and connections to get anything she wants.

That's part of the frustration she experiences, though; people constantly accuse her of only being successful because she's famous, which in the documentary she takes particular issue with in regards to her DJing. It's difficult for outsiders to her life to discern ""success from fame"" from ""success from talent,"" because talent alone so often does not result in success, while fame alone *can* produce success, and it can certainly open the doors to develop any talent. So in the documentary, Paris experiences a profound authenticity crisis, and when she decides to explore her authentic Self, the first thing she has to deal with is the trauma from her teenage years. It's laid bare that fame, success, wealth-seeking, etc., is all a set of coping mechanisms she's been using to run from her trauma.

That comes to one of the more cruel elements of trauma: Everyone gets randomly-assigned coping mechanisms, and while many run your life into the ground, some of them produce beauty, fame, fortune, and all kinds of success. The latter set are definitely preferable, but they still produce people who suffer terribly. It's just that those people then have access to better care to recover. That's what will happen for Paris now, if she goes down this road: A difficult, very painful recovery, with a privileged wind at her back."
4501,2020-10-06 13:21:10,j64lx5,"I admire Paris Hilton so much, I really do. She probably has a ton of personality issues because of the fake persona she's had to put on for people all these years. Not to mention all the issues that come with being harassed by tons of media snobs for her entire life.

I've heard nothing but good things about Paris. Apparently, she's kind, soft-spoken, and very intelligent."

4503,2020-10-06 13:58:45,j64lx5,"I really liked the Paris doc. It‚Äôs so nice to know that a woman like her, admired by many, deals with some of the same issues that I do. 
Her family relationships seem strained because she is a bit of an outlier. Her sister purports to know everything about her but she comes off as controlling and subtly puts paris down at multiple points. She seems to have her own ideas about what Paris *should* do rather than helping or listening to her in a genuine way. The scene where Nikki asks Paris if she ever apologized to their parents for her behavior growing up is so frustrating to watch bc Nikki is the obviously the good child and she has no idea what Paris (the troubled child) went through.

As far as her brand goes, she comes from money and a recognizable family name, so there‚Äôs a background of privilege. I‚Äôm sure she also met a lot of important people while she was partying in the city. People that roll in the upper echelons pick up the kind of connections that will invest in their ideas or put them into contact with people in whatever industry. Given she is such a popular socialite, I‚Äôm sure there were people who believed in her vision."

4505,2020-10-06 06:34:07,j5zw7q,"I've been considering her a 4 because of the outsider thing. However, I now am leaning towards 3sp. Her whole life focus has been on gaining financial independence. She's an incredibly hard worker with no days off ever, it seems. The boyfriend in the documentary, while admittedly acting like a jerk, seemed to be upset that she gave her work far more attention than him. 3sp has a tendency to ignore relationships and bury themselves in their work, which then makes people feel ignored. Also, I don't think a 4 could pretend to be someone else, role-playing. It's just inauthentic. She's more pragmatic and goal focused. Not a 3sx, because they are _actually_ identified with their image to the point where they don't know it. She's very much aware of what she's doing and knows it's not real. She's a business person and entrepreneur focused on acquiring wealth."
4506,2020-10-06 15:09:14,j5zw7q,I think she‚Äôs a 3w4. The 4 is there for sure but I see the type 3 override the type 4 motivations and fears in several instances / areas of her life.
4507,2020-10-06 16:48:44,j5zw7q,Wow thanks for that great explanation! Also I didn‚Äôt know that about type threes in regards to their subtypes where one subtype identifies with their image while another subtype doesn‚Äôt...hmmm.

Distance is a factor but you were in a long distance relationship so it shouldn‚Äôt be that much of a barrier
4710,2020-11-03 17:01:36,jn1ndv,"The way you describe your long, slow fall into love sounds like you may be demi? Idk, I'm not demi, it's just a thought. 

That said, you're definitely attracted to at least one woman, and it sounds like you've had less intense, but still very real, attractions in the past. 

I'm panromantic and my attraction to people of different genders/gender presentations have always been strangely different from one another, which seems consistent with what you're experiencing. 

The only advice I think is applicable to this situation is probably the hardest to take: give yourself time. Time to see how you feel about your current relationship, time to see how, and if, things evolve with this new potential, etc.  

Hoping things work out well for you."

I see where you are leading with the dark side but but she's meant to be a kid and honestly is still begining to unpack all that. Yes she could have greater depth but copying Tony's playboy egomania wouldn't make her any better bc she's just be a copy and a bad one at that. Her own internal struggle is definitely something to be fleshed out, but not as the same as Tony's"
4825,2020-12-13 04:00:10,kbvioq,"So you want Riri to be exactly like Tony? That‚Äôs what i didn‚Äôt like about Miles because he was too similar like Peter.

Whereas I like Riri because she‚Äôs the complete opposite to Tony and that contrast makes their dynamic more interesting. She‚Äôs a random girl who comes from nothing and spends her free time tinkering in the garage, lives in a tough neighbourhood like Chicago where she lost her father and best friend. Is a socially awkward introvert with no friends but is a genius inventor that was inspired by Tony being a regular human being in a metal suit who hangs with gods and super soldiers and wanted to be a superhero."
4826,2020-12-13 03:01:36,kbvioq,"Honestly, she's just boring. Minimal personality. Tony Stark, not boring. Lots of personality. 

I preferred when Doctor Doom was Iron Man."
4827,2020-12-12 22:12:44,kbvioq,"I get what you're going for.  ***Riri has no imperfections.***  She's a Mary Sue character.  You're right, shouldn't Tony Stark's prot√©g√© likewise have some awful character flaw to overcome?  Riri's only challenge is external, some message on systemic racism or something.  Regardless of how you feel on that message, it's an *external* challenge not an *internal* one.   External challenges are the supervillains, internal challenges are the ones which make the character grow as a person.  Riri has no internal challenges, she's already the smartest eva and the bestest eva no arguments."
4828,2020-12-12 21:13:08,kbvioq,"I feel like it's very off the mark to boil down Tony's legacy to ""being able to do good despite being bad."" What defines Tony isn't the issues he struggles with, it's the fact that he could overcome them and become a hero. He is a hero *with* issues, not a hero *despite* having issues.

It's also important to take into account the kind of experiences that shaped Tony into the man he was before becoming Iron Man. He wasn't just born a rich asshole, he was abused and neglected by his father, stripped away from his mother, and his goodness had become buried underneath all of that, but it was still there.

I don't think Riri needs to be a Tony Stark Jr. to work. She is a person with her own set of issues, and what she shares with Tony is resiliency. That's what makes Iron Man, Iron Man. The ability to overcome his issues, not the issues that he overcomes."
4829,2020-12-14 10:43:57,kbvioq,"They should just skip Ironheart entirely, or make her tied to Wakanda or a Multiverse. 

 We have Morgan in the MCU now. Wait a couple of years and let Morgan ""try and live up to her fathers legacy"" she will create and use  some mcguffin and go back to Endgame's death scene and ""saves"" her dad before he dies. We have RDJ and her in one movie. (GREAT for sales!) They come back to the current time line and it's all fucked up since Tony was not there back in Endgame. We need to figure out a way to go back. 

Mean while they are being hunted by this other mysterious Ironman-esc person. They have to work togehter and have an arc. She will understand the power they have and how she should wield it. Being able to do something shouldn't automatically mean you should. Something Tony never got to teach her. They figure out a way and places Tony back in his rightful time. Closing her arc, she can not live up to him, she can be better/ be her own person her own Iron-person.  Contiuning his legacy not being it. 

It can lead into Kang or Kang can be the main antagonist due the time travel stuff. SHE can even be the Kang tying it into the Stark Legacy. They are running from this Kang and this Kang only wants to place Tony back in Endgame. For example

I want someone just as much of an A-hole as Tony but in a different way, for different reasons, and that needs different solutions to her problems."
4832,2020-12-13 04:55:15,kbvioq,There's obviously a lot of other character flaws she could have. I gave the example of Paris Hilton as an hilarious figure to be the protege of Tony Stark. This very vain and superficial and annoying person that is surprisingly a genius and decides to do something better with her life but kind of struggles to see what that is. There are countless other ways you could approach a sucessor to Tony Stark that make them completely different from him but much more consistent with his story than Riri Williams. And Tony's biggest struggles weren't about him feeling unimportant because Thor existed.
4833,2020-12-13 03:14:49,kbvioq,Never read the Doctor Doom issues. Can you tell me more about them and why you liked them?
4834,2020-12-22 17:26:22,kbvioq,Yeah I don't like her aswell. I am so annoyed that she will come to the MCU
4835,2020-12-13 00:27:29,kbvioq,"I would agree that Riri Williams is a Mary Sue only if we're talking about her before Bendis stopped writing her. Both Jim Zub and Eve Ewing really fleshed out Riri, and now she is an actually interesting, flawed character."
4836,2020-12-13 04:05:37,kbvioq,"Riri is not a Mary Sue. [I‚Äôve made a thread about this a while ago](https://twitter.com/flexstylez/status/1258189907044032512?s=21) because i was tired of this word being misused with her. 

Riri has flaws and is not the ‚Äúsmartest or bestest eva‚Äù, she isn‚Äôt even smarter than Tony. Funny enough nobody complains about Valeria who is though but that‚Äôs a different argument entirely."
4837,2020-12-12 23:31:12,kbvioq,"I agree. Sadly, they don't make heroes with imperfections anymore. And I don't even think it has to be a thing exclusive to Iron Man, but you do notice the difference in the dynamics when you don't have that lovable [character flaw] in superheroes. Everyone is a Captain America goody two shoes."
4838,2020-12-13 00:17:49,kbvioq,"I definitely don't think that if Tony had an protege it would be someone with the same character flaws as him, but i absolutely think he would choose someone with big character flaws. Because honestly, as much as he recognizes the good of Steve Trevor, he also wants other people to learn from him. Riri can't really learn anything from Tony's personal journey. She only aspires to create things as innovative as Tony. But I think what Tony would be most proud of is the fact that he was able to understand the error of his ways and become something better. I also recognize how his family life led him to be what he was, but that doesn't detract from my argument whatsoever."
4839,2020-12-12 23:40:50,kbvioq,"Well, every superhero has issues and shows some kind of resiliency; find me one who doesn't. What makes Tony Stark a much more interesting superhero is those internal problems he deals with. Sure, not every character or Iron Man squire/sidekick has to have the same issues‚Ä¶ the point is, Riri Williams doesn't stand out much more from her generation of heroes like the Miles Morales or the Kamala Khans, because they mostly have the same personality, just in a different setting and scenario."
4840,2020-12-13 02:11:04,kbvioq,"Read the Ironheart stuff by Eve Ewing. She‚Äôs definitely got some flaws there. Bendis‚Äô Ironheart was a Mary Sue, but other writers have been able to grow the character."
4841,2020-12-13 01:01:15,kbvioq,"What character growth is there to be had?  She's perfect, end of story, enjoy your life."
4842,2020-12-13 08:12:15,kbvioq,"Riri's problems are all external.  There's little to no ways she needs to grow or change as a person.    


At least with Bendis.  Eve Ewing did a good job of fleshing out her social introvertedness and fear of emotional vulnerability, but...  That's not really a *huge* character flaw.  Nothing that'd require an intervention.  It's a step in the right direction but needs more.  

&#x200B;

I dunno what Riri needs...  Hmm.  Not a substance abuse problem, no need to rehash the same ground as Tony did.  I could see an anger issue being something interesting.  Easy to be antagonized when you're a superhero and her speaking to a therapist or life coach might harken to Tony's going to AA.  I've known more people with anger issues than I have alcoholics, personally.  Or maybe we take her fear of loss and ramp it up to an actually dangerous level.

While Tony Stark is injured, Doctor Doom takes the mantle of Iron Man as an act of redemption. Loved the art, dialogue and characterisations. The Doom/ Iron Man costume was excellent too."
4844,2020-12-13 07:48:26,kbvioq,Thanks for the thread. This is the type of breakdown that I like. It still doesn't create a charcter that I feel reflects who Tony Stark would gravitate the most to but it's interesting none the less
4845,2020-12-13 18:10:37,kbvioq,"Pretty much any female character in popular stuff gets labeled a mary sue, it's exhausting"
4846,2020-12-13 04:16:09,kbvioq,"Yes, thank you! I wish they explored her feelings of failure and loneliness more but she's definitely been though shit already."
4847,2020-12-13 11:33:30,kbvioq,"Actually, plenty of people complained about Valeria when she was given the title of ""smartest Marvel character""‚Ä¶ until I think Moon Girl became the smartest one.

Anyways, I still think Riri needs a real flaw‚Ä¶ none of this ""introvert"", ""survivor's guilt"" ""got beat up a couple times"" weak BS‚Ä¶ I mean the type of character flaw that has legitimately serious consequences like Tony's arrogance getting people killed in Civil War. Something that makes her truly complex, not eliciting of pity."
4848,2020-12-13 01:00:27,kbvioq,I think it's because they want to encourage people like her (black representation) but it's so hard to give her a fault without falling into a stereotype.  Black Panther has the same problem.  And they're not ballsy or skilled enough to confront one of those head on.
4849,2020-12-13 00:26:10,kbvioq,"Every hero showcases resiliency, but resiliency is part of Tony's DNA and it's ingrained in his origin. He didn't endure extensive training to become Iron Man, he didn't become Iron Man by chance, he wasn't entrusted the Iron Man Armor by a mentor. He became Iron Man to survive when he had no other option. He isn't just called Iron Man because it's metal, iron is a symbol of strength and resistance.

And to show that this is something acknowledged in the comics, there's this moment in *Empyre* that has Tony basically point out that working with the clock ticking and the odds against his favor is the most Tony Stark he will ever be.

Yes, the problems that Tony suffers, either personality-wise or physically, make him a much more interesting character than others, but it's not what defines him as Iron Man. After all, Tony wasn't an ""egotistical near dysfunctional human being"" until modern times.

And I would say that Riri has a much more distinct personality than other modern legacy characters. When Jim Zub started writing her, he made Riri socially awkard (and not in a quirky way), and Eve Ewing expanded on that, almost coding her as autistic. Riri is also often abrasive, even to people who want to help her, doesn't open up easily, can be judgmental, and isn't always right."
4850,2020-12-13 00:27:19,kbvioq,"I think the way Bendis wrote Miles Morales was very similar to how he wrote Peter Parker. But he had a completely different home life and surrounding cast of characters and that createe very different dynamics. Throughout different media his personality has been molded to fit whatever they desired, but that is also true of Peter Parker. I think Into the Spiderverse did a great job of creating a specific feeling of what thr character was, and that might come to influence future interpretations of him (in some ways in already influenced Insomniac). Kamala Khan however has a lot of specific insecurities that make her very different from Riri and Miles. But I sort of understand how they all have a very jovial essence and fanboy projection to them. That's something that I think will be overcome once Marvel allows them to grow up"
4851,2020-12-13 08:29:27,kbvioq,I like some of those ideas so clearly there is potential
4852,2020-12-13 03:45:32,kbvioq,Ok nice
4853,2020-12-13 17:17:00,kbvioq,"Valeria receives zero hate despite being the smartest little miss perfect who can solve problems faster than Reed and Doom since the age of 3! Moon girl, despite her being labelled the smartest character in Marvel for no reason whatsoever only got a fraction of hate and then it died down immediately because they stopped caring about her. Whereas Riri to this day can‚Äôt go a single thread without hate.  

What are you on about ‚Äòreal‚Äô flaws, they are e.g. her being a introvert is her being emotionally closed off, guarded, unable to open up and make friends. This stems from the incident in her childhood and how it affected her. Flaws are imperfections and struggles a character has. Riri has them. She‚Äôs ruled by guilt and fear. She can be standoffish and abrasive too if you need more, which lead to Thanos almost killing Riri and her being traumatised. A similar situation happened against Midnight Fire. Regardless, adding more flaws to her character is _not_ going to make her more likeable. As much as I like Ms Marvel i can‚Äôt off the top of my head think of her flaws but it‚Äôs not as if she needs a lot considering how beloved she is. 

With Riri fans will latch onto it tho and use it as confirmation bias for why they hate her once proven wrong that she isn‚Äôt a Mary Sue. 


Riri is fine. It‚Äôs fans who need to _read_ and notice the work that‚Äôs gone into her character."
4854,2020-12-13 15:39:51,kbvioq,"Likely right‚Ä¶ but they can't all be virtuous angels, all the time. Even Peter Parker has blood on his hands, and he's the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man‚Ä¶"
4855,2020-12-13 09:45:25,kbvioq,"You could, just the same, say resiliency is part of Steve Rogers' DNA, because he insisted on joining the Army, even after being told he was putting himself at higher risk than other soldiers due to his condition. Or Peter Parker, who sacrifices his personal life and relationships to save people. That's an essential part of most superheroes and it's not particularly unique to Tony Stark. It's his personal demons that make him stand out, both in universe and as a character; it may not have been as apparent as in present era of Marvel, but it WAS there for decades.

As for Riri, socially awkward, bordering autistic, abrasive, etc‚Ä¶ sounds like the template for every teen character. There's really not much in there that you can identify as her own trait, the way you immediately associate ""conceited and arrogant superhero"" to Tony."
4856,2020-12-13 16:04:44,kbvioq,"I agree! I don't mean to crap all over the character as a concept, just the execution is needing to be fleshed out much more."
4857,2020-12-14 08:45:28,kbvioq,"You're being disingenuous if you think Valeria got no hate‚Ä¶ I was there when the arguments raged on about her being labeled the smartest person in the universe without having any real feats. You may not have noticed because the FF books hadn't been getting any attention for a while, but it did happen. Same with the Moon Girl books; they don't get a lot of circulation, so people argue about it for a while and then ignore it like the prints. Maybe Riri gets more attention because she's a heritage character of one of the most popular Marvel superheroes right now, but even then, I only see these debates pop up every other month.

I don't need a verbose description of what it means to be an introvert, or why she qualifies as one; it doesn't make the argument any more legitimate. There's plenty of introverted characters already; it's not particularly unique. At least when Ms Marvel did it, it was somewhat different.

Clearly there's something missing in the character, and people want to give it a chance, but it won't be done unless writers and editors recognize the problem instead of assuming people only hate her for superficial reasons. Maybe in a while longer I'll try again to get into her books; unfortunately, everytime I try, I just can't muster interest."
4858,2020-12-13 16:07:14,kbvioq,"Yeah but playing devil's advocate...  She can't be lazy, she can't be angry, she can't be very poor, she can't be a criminal...  it's difficult to give her a serious flaw that does not already play into a black stereotype. not impossible, but difficult. And maybe they should tackle that difficult subject head on, but they don't. They just want her to be encouraging."
4859,2020-12-13 14:34:22,kbvioq,"None of those examples show as much resilience as Iron Man's origin. Yes, Steve Rogers insisted to join the army, but his hardship was being lanky and it was something he didn't overcome on his own, the solution was given to him. Peter Parker's constant sacrifice of his personal life is commendable, but it's a choice.

Like I already mentioned, Stark didn't pursue to become Iron Man. It was a result of finding himself in deep water, at the brink of death. He adapted to that situation and emerged victorious. There is no better example of resilience than that.

And like I also already mentioned, Stark's issues make him stand out but don't define him as a hero. I'm not saying he didn't have issues, but back in the Silver Age, his defining flaw was being at risk of dying if he didn't have his chestplate charged, not something related to his personality. Stark didn't have such a defining brash attitude until present day, and the character used to work without it for decades before it was established.

And no, those traits in Riri are not the template for every teen character. If you actually read Riri, you'll see that she actually stands out from the other teen heroes due to her personality, especially in books like Champions where she is actively working with them."
4860,2020-12-14 08:13:26,kbvioq,"Let's hope they address this; history shows that flawed characters are more relatable, and even with mistakes, people can appreciate a hero that tries to do the right thing, even if they're not perfect."
4861,2021-02-22 07:40:06,kbvioq,It‚Äôs sad because she‚Äôs still a racial stereotype
4862,2020-12-14 08:06:42,kbvioq,"I wasn't contesting who was more or less resilient‚Ä¶ but if you're gonna make a comparison, certainly you can make the case that Steve Rogers has shown as much willpower and spirit in the face of obstacles as Tony has, if not more. It's true that the serum helped him overcome his physical weakness, but it was his resilience that allowed him to be in position to receive it in the first place. **The serum made him stronger‚Ä¶ but it wasn't the serum that made him resilient; he ALWAYS WAS resilient.** Wasn't there also a story where Kang the Conqueror kept sending Steve Rogers back in time every time he got close to defeating him‚Ä¶ and Steve kept coming over and over again? Tony is certainly a genius and a formidable hero‚Ä¶ but he *has* given up on multiple occasions through history, often falling back on alcoholism. I don't remember Steve Rogers ever quitting like that, even for a moment.

But then again, that's the whole point of why we love Tony Stark; he's not a perfect superhero, but he does what he can. His problems with alcoholism and depression go way back and are not anything created recently by any means; he was always known as a serial philander, even if his exploits were not as detailed as they have been recently. His weaknesses don't define him in the sense that they don't rule his life, but they do serve as an example of someone who is not a boy scout, and yet proves you don't have to be one in order to be a hero.

Riri needs to be more complex, even if it means giving her some kind of personality flaw. You say she stands out, but you couldn't really mention anything that was particularly unique to her."
4863,2020-12-14 14:24:24,kbvioq,"If you're not contesting them, why even bring them up? I think you are mixing up resilience with resistance a bit. Resilience isn't about not falling down, *it's about getting back up*. So it doesn't make Tony any less resilient that he has hit rock bottom, and it only reinforces that attribute since he manages to get back up.

I still don't see how this is a matter of discussion, really. I've already pointed out how Marvel themselves constantly acknowledge resilience as one of Tony's defining features, from that moment I mentioned from *Empyre* to the fact that at one point Tony's own company was called Stark Resilient.

And how can you say that I couldn't mention anything that was particularly unique to her? I already did. That you think that her being coded as autist is somehow something every other teenage hero has despite that being wrong *is not on me*. The same for Riri's abrasive attitude. Most if not all teenage Marvel heroes are social butterflies, and I've already pointed out that if you read a book like Champions, in which Riri has to bounce off other teenage heroes, you will actually notice that she stands out. I also forgot to mention that she has suffered from panic attacks due to the shootout that killed her stepfather and best friend, or from that one time Thanos whooped her ass. And even if you want to say that's something other teenage heroes experience, no, it's not.

(And really, I don't see what's resilient about being given a way out of your medical issues by an almost-magic drug)"
4864,2020-12-17 03:23:50,kbvioq,"I didn't bring up who was more resilient than the other‚Ä¶ **you** did. When I pointed out almost all superheroes shared this quality in some level, you were the one who started comparing them [by responding with:](https://www.reddit.com/r/ironman/comments/kbvioq/the_thing_about_riri_williams/gfp72oy/)

> None of those examples show as much resilience as Iron Man's origin.

As a follow up, all I did was point out that the argument can be made both ways, IF you were to argue the point, which is not what I was debating anyways. Both Rogers and Stark have fallen down, but usually it's Stark that has stayed down for a while, whereas Rogers immediately gets back up every time. I already pointed out 2 examples of Steve Rogers taking setbacks and bouncing right back. Seems like that's evidence that Rogers can be deemed more resilient, and that's the evidence of history saying it, not just inferred from a name despite proof to the contrary."
4865,2020-12-17 03:59:47,kbvioq,"No. When you pointed out that almost all superheroes share that quality, what I did was reinforce the idea that in Tony's case is a vital part of his origin without mentioning any other heroes. **You** are the one who specifically name-dropped Spider-Man and Captain America, and saying ""well, these guys are also resilient"" is a form of contest.

And the kind of hardships you've mentioned don't really show Rogers boucing right back as much as they show him not falling down to begin with. This is why I pointed out that there's a nuance between resistence and resilience. And like I already pointed out, insisting to enlist in the army after being denied is not resilience.

Another reason I think resilience is much more fitting to Iron Man is because of the depths from which Tony has recovered. I can't recall Captain America losing as much as Tony has when he has hit rock bottom, out of the many times he has. Continuing fighting against impossible odds to stop the villain of the hour is commendable, but I believe it's much more inspiring to pull yourself from nearly dying in the snowy streets after losing every aspect of your life and being consumed by an addiction."
4866,2020-12-17 04:22:06,kbvioq,You literally made a direct claim about who had more resilience between Iron Man and others‚Ä¶ how is that not a comparison? Completely different from describing how important it is to the character alone.

4913,2020-12-14 11:05:08,kavm7t,"I went down the rabbit hole with the troubled teen industry after watching the Dr. Phil shows. It all started because the ""Cash me outside"" girl suddenly became popular and I wanted to see what the fuss is all about. Apparently Dr. Phil sent her to one of these reform schools and she behaved afterwards but reverted back after a few months.

I decided to check out other videos that he did about these wilderness programs and he kept endorsing Turnabout Ranch. I don't know if TR is abusing the kids or if it is a good program.

There are also other centers that he sends these troubled kids to. The pattern is the same. There is a teen girl or boy acting out, sneaking out, doing drugs, cutting class, having sex, stealing, etc. Most videos include explosive screaming fights with their parents who are crying and at their wit's end on how to make their teen behave properly.

The last part of the program is usually having the kid woken up at 4am with 2 big guys and the kid gets cuffed and placed into a black SUV and driven to the middle of nowhere. Or the kid would be cuffed after the show and dragged to the black SUV after crying and begging their parents not to send them away.

Then a follow-up would happen a few months later where this ""problem child"" becomes transformed to an ""ideal child"". I think this is where the parents are conned into signing away their rights to their own kids.

I don't know if Dr. Phil is getting paid for each kid he puts there, but it seems like he is.

Anyway if you are curious about the other side r/Parenting has questions about these and reading through them I can feel the desperation of the parents. I believe it would be better for you survivors to explain why you were a troubled teen in the first place. I think you guys who have been through this can better explain why you acted the way you did when you were a teen, how to help their teen from misbehaving and hopefully it can save future troubled kids from going through what you did."

It is only when I saw Paris's video (and so much more people who have been through this) that I changed my mind about these centers.

4961,2020-12-08 15:43:14,k965gl,"From the headline, I was expecting a story about the necktie."
4962,2020-12-08 16:02:52,k965gl,But I like my sweats. They‚Äôre from Orvis and super comfy.
4963,2020-12-08 15:54:49,k965gl,I'm pretty comfortable saying that anyone that draws strong conclusions about someone else based on what that person is wearing is some level of asshole.
4964,2020-12-08 16:20:55,k965gl,"LOL. Friends. 

I still own my Juicy sweatsuit and wear it around the house pretty often. One of my teenage daughter‚Äôs friends asked if it was ‚Äúsomething from the Spice Girls.‚Äù"
4965,2020-12-08 16:27:58,k965gl,"No way. 

I can‚Äôt think of a greater cost/joy ratio with clothes than my $12 Russell Athletic sweatpants.

We‚Äôll all be wearing Federation unitards soon enough."
4966,2020-12-08 15:35:49,k965gl,"If anyone is in the market for a pair of *substantial* sweatpants to help get through the winter, I strongly recommend the Land's End ""Serious Sweatpants."" These are the most heavy-duty sweats I've been able to find in the US. L.L. Bean used to make a similarly beefy pair, but based on recent reviews, that model has been replaced with an inferior product made with far flimsier fabric.

If you're in Canada, of course, hit up Roots. But you Canadians already knew that."
4967,2020-12-08 16:51:56,k965gl,"I recently bought a pair of Public Rec all day pants... supposedly sweats that pass as khakis. 

They don't really pass as either. They are comfortable, but too thin for winter (which strikes me as a failure as sweat pants), and they do not really look like khakis beyond a very casual inspection. I don't think I would wear them to work, but they will be part of the home work wardrobe as soon as it's warmer. 

I don't want to see a lot of people wearing sweats at work, but, honestly, once we go back to work, I don't anticipate seeing a lot of people at work, so whatever they wear, I'm good. 

If I have an article of clothing that others wear that I really hate them to wear to work, it's pajama pants. That was a favorite of some women back when I worked in television. Not that it was a formal work place (it wasn't), but I kinda felt they were overly slovenly, even for a jeans and Hawaiian shirt kinda workplace."
4968,2020-12-08 18:03:53,k965gl,"I love wearing sweats and leggings around the house but I do tend to change into jeans when I go out, I‚Äôm just more comfortable like that. I recently bought some old navy ‚Äújoggers‚Äù and they are great. 

Also, that quote from Karl Lagerfeld never fails to crack me up for some reason."

4970,2020-12-08 19:17:53,k965gl,Does anyone wear sweats to workout? I don't really understand the original point of wearing something extra hot to work out in. Was it originally for cold weather? Was the point to sweat more? I want to be as close to naked as legally permissible when I run most of the year.
4971,2020-12-08 15:42:13,k965gl,My tie dye sweat sets would like a word
4972,2020-12-08 15:39:08,k965gl,"I think you have to have a pretty tight body and tall frame under the sweats not to make them look sloppy. It's the nature of sweats to be sloppy.

To be fair, my boyfriend wears sweats a lot. That's okay; he's been dealing with his chronic health issues for months, and something that he can sleep in as well as sit around in is good. But when it was time to go somewhere or have people over for Thanksgiving... he put on his khakis. (We got him elastic-waist khakis. They look professional enough on Zoom when he stands up, but they're way more comfortable than a fixed waist pant.) 

I don't own any sweats. I own yoga pants, but I don't like leaving the house in them, and increasingly I just wear them when I'm exercising; I like jeans more.  Of course, I'm Gen X and fashionable is one thing I' surely am not."

When I finally saw a sexy romper I was really conflicted."
4974,2020-12-08 22:27:44,k965gl,"I don't really care one way or the other.  They're nice for travel or around the house.  They're impractical for nearly all other things.  They don't stay up well on their own.  They're horrible for any kind of manual labor.  They don't cut wind, they soak up water."

5000,2020-12-30 05:14:28,kms9ff,Which program in Utah? I was at Island View which is now called ‚ÄúElevations‚Äù after island view was shut down by the state. Nothing changed after it was shut down though. Just renamed. I‚Äôm 35 and i still have nightmares from that place every night.
5001,2020-12-30 08:15:34,kms9ff,Welcome to the club indeed.  This is an industry that we must pull all the stops out for.  We must learn the names kidnappers and staff and hold them on a trial of public opinion.
5002,2020-12-30 07:12:37,kms9ff,"My parents paid to send me away now I'm a 3B felon who lives on a ship getting paid under the table because taxes are for suckers. I spend my holidays alone and on my birthday is I cry in a corner because everyone's unaware the trauma that I endured during my teenage years. I used to think that I was the problem and that there was something wrong with me. But that wasn't the case is what I'm starting to find out. Ever since I seen Paris Hilton on television standing up against Provo Canyon School, which I went to the boys campus in 2004, it wasn't until then that I realized that I had c-ptsd, PTSD, hyper-vigilance, depression, problems with authority, abandonment issues, and virtually no possible way of ever trusting someone. Matter of fact the ones who I love the most and the ones that I like it closest to me I somehow end up scaring and traumatizing them. I'm always looking for an escape I'm always thinking someone is out to get me, which they are. I hate sex offenders I hate people who take advantage of people and I hate people that inflict pain upon animals. And on top of that actually stand up for those things I don't care if it's someone's Grandpa I'm going to make them cry if you're taking advantage of an elderly person or fucking a kid. Just like those Mormons in Utah taking advantage of families and fucking lives up. I realize now that there's nothing wrong with me and despite the problems I have in life I realized that I am better than most people because at least I do stand up for what I believe in and at least I know what I can go through. Fuck those schools they never killed me all they did was make me stronger than I've ever been. The downside to that is that the majority of people aren't that strong. All they are is weak individuals afraid of everything stuck on their phones wearing masks thinking that there such thing as a Corona. To sum it all up in one word I mean 3 words, they are pussies. That includes the family that sent you away. That includes the fair weather friends who think they can give you advice on something that they have no idea what the fuck they're talkin about. That includes the people who keep their mouth shut because they're scared of you because they don't understand you. And that includes the people who think because you don't have what makes them happy it means you're not succeeding in life. All those people are weak and all those people could never survive what we went through. Keep your head up always. Never let anyone say that you're not good enough. Fuck Provo Canyon School. #iseeyousurvivor"

And I will not watch Wray I say due to others and their feelings because that is the Left..... They want people dependant and weak instead of morally bound and self sufficient. Fuck the left fuck covid. Sorry about your loved one. But that is how screwed the system is to were they play people like puppets save if these comments are all I can do with out causing physical harm. Then so ve it. God is on my side and he will deliver the chosen as his Word says. Which also says the great about who deny Him and choose the sign which is the vaccine.

But as long as that's not happened yet, I think you should focus on becoming who you want to be. Make your life what you want it to be. Reclaim yourself from the pain and trauma.

You've clearly gone off the beaten path, probably thanks to the course your parents set you on. I hope that means you're now free to chart your own course.

Live the life you have. See what you need to see and do what you need to do.

I hope you find meaning and happiness on your journey."

make your fame as being obnoxious rich kid with a sex tape and yeah it's just as much an indictment of culture that launched that career.

she may be a nice person irl. i didn't think her actual acting/singing was especially bad. her stardom is indicative of trashy obsession with wealth and anti intellectualism. so yeah, no surprised she, and what she represents, is not especially well liked outside fanbase.

There's no shortage of short-term, small-scale utopias out there. In principle, every political system which has arisen organically went through a stage where it was a small-scale, short-term political system, which subsequently stood up to the test of time, as well as several trials by fire."

There isn't a coherent alternative. If two gangs fight over whether a certain action is legal or illegal, they can't both win. The action will either be restricted or it won't be, and the result will eventually be formalized.

The only thing 'private law' might achieve is 'competing governments,' like little city-states that are constantly fighting each other.

Pol Pot was straight up mad man. Khmer Rouge also outright rejected communism after few years of rule, and was ultimately defeated by communist Vietnam.

>Famines

Both dekulakization and Great Chinese Famine were ultimately effects of tries at rapid industrialization, as both USSR and China saw it as necessary when so much of the world was still capitalist.

Maybe the Allies could have succeeded without causing Famine. Maybe USSR and China could have succeeded without causing Famines. Either hold both accountable or none.

And as anyone can ask for a case with anyone, you can spread the word that your neighbor whose dog keeps pooping on your garden is a child rapist and he can either be ostracized as if he really was a child rapist, or be forced to pay a private judge in order to prove his innocense. 

When being a suspect of a crime, or even a false accusation, starts to cost money, I think that's taking capitalism a little too far."
5121,2020-12-29 18:20:31,kmevmq,"I've got shit to do today so I'll leave this for later. If you can't describe these answers in a reddit comment and instead link to an article with no comments or any way to refute those arguments, and an hour long video as part of a reddit discussion, I don't know what to tell you. 

But unless I'm really misinformed about how an Ancap society works, you only benefit from protection against criminals if you can afford it. And nothing stops those protection agencies from abusing their power (possibly hired by bad faith actors in the first place) outside of other protection agencies. 

The state didn't start by existing. Rather it came as groups of people were interested in ruling over others and each community was either conquered by them, or pooled their resources together to create an entity to protect them from those people. Without protection from some sort protection agency, poor people will likely get in protection rackets where the mobs 'force' them to hire their services anyway. And either they don't hire another 'legitimate' agency and are forced to live under the mob's rule, or they manage to scrounge up the money and there will likely be shootouts between the two 'agencies'."
5122,2020-12-29 18:18:10,kmevmq,"Being a suspect of a crime costs a lot of money now in our current system...

Also, why can a private organization not investigate crimes? And a private organization has more incentive to be more accurate because if they get the wrong guy, they will be held accountable. They would have to pay restitution and it would be bad for future business. Now if the state gets the wrong guy, they use tax payer funds to pay them off and keep their jobs and the monopoly."
5123,2020-12-29 18:28:25,kmevmq,"Lol this is a lot more complicated of an issue that can be solved in Reddit comments. If you can fully describe your philosophy in a Reddit comment then I would say you need a better philosophy. Ha ha

And yeah I don‚Äôt expect you to take time out of your day to view the links if you don‚Äôt want to. My point is there are answers out there if you care to look at them."
5124,2020-12-29 18:22:38,kmevmq,"Not in my country. Trials and lawyers are free. If they're not where you live, sorry to hear.

And they can. Question is why would they? Answer is, they're being paid to. And if someone can't afford to pay them, they won't do any investigation. Which was my point. Only those able to afford it would get police services, whether protection or investigation. Unless you figure there's gonna be a number of competent detectives doing it pro-bono."
5125,2020-12-29 18:33:39,kmevmq,"Insurance companies have a big incentive to prevent and solve crimes in an ancap society. The more crime they prevent and solve, the less money they have to pay out. This would still provide the spread of costs for police protections that you want the same way your auto insurance does.

And lawyers do pro-Bono work all the time. Other professions as well. Have you heard of the country doctors who take payment in chickens or casseroles or whatever. I think humans are much more cooperative than you give them credit for."
5126,2020-12-29 21:22:42,kmevmq,"Why would an insurance company prevent and solve crime in places where most people aren't paying them to do so though? It sounds counter productive to solve problems for people who aren't, nor will be, your customers.

And yeah, *some* lawyers work pro-bono. Some doctors do it too. Some engineers maybe as well. But if there was enough people working for free that everyone could have access to them, then nobody would pay for those jobs. You said getting accused of a crime in modern society was expensive, but then how is it if we can expect to find lawyers and judges working for free?"
5127,2020-12-29 21:55:52,kmevmq,"Sorry I didn‚Äôt explain the insurance thing very well. People/businesses would have insurance on their homes and property for theft and such. The insurance companies would be then be incentivized to prevent these crimes so they don‚Äôt have to pay out, or solve the crimes so they can seek compensation from the perpetrator. That‚Äôs the basic premise anyways. Or the insurance company could incentivize clients taking their own preventative measures like installing cameras and whatnot.  It‚Äôs the same thing like when All State gives you a ‚Äòsafe driver discount‚Äô. So they may not solve crimes for people who are not their customers but that is why having a free market in the security sector is important so there are many options for different budgets. And giving only the state this power does not guarantee that all will be protected either, just ask poor inner city communities right now. 

On your second point, I don‚Äôt fully understand your criticism. Some people working for free in specific circumstances does not lead to a breakdown of a market."
5128,2020-12-29 23:43:24,kmevmq,"My point is that for some people, there's no budget that would work. There's hundreds of thousands of homeless people in the US which, in an ancap society, would simply stop being covered for any service, including police, medical, education and more, for they cannot afford them. The way that taxation works puts a very low 'cap' on the cost of those services to poor people because it's based on a percentage of their income. Even if you live off of 100 dollars a month, you still got access to what some consider necessities. On the opposite side of that coin, those with the means to pay (the wealthy, millionaires, etc) pay many times over what they personally benefit from the police, teachers, doctors (in a universal healthcare country), so they subsidize those who can't afford it.

In an Ancap system, the wealthy and millionaires would either pay far less for those things, or pay similar amounts for a much greater service, which is great for them, but people without an income or with very low incomes would either lose those services entirely or get extremely weak ones. As you are likely aware, the 1% pays more taxes than the bottom 90% combined, and as these taxes are (mostly) evenly distributed by the population, poor people (and middle class and basically any non-wealthy person who fit in the 90%) benefit a lot more. In an Ancap society though, the quality of services they can afford would sharply decrease.  A private police agency would have a choice between protecting a 100 people for X amount of money or 9000 people for that same amount of money, and you can imagine that to those in the bottom, they're not going to get anywhere near the level of quality that they do today where the police get 2X for 9100 people spread semi-evenly.

And I know. My point is that there are not enough lawyers or doctors working for free to allow most poor people to rely on them when they can't afford the regular people, unlike in a tax-based system where those poor people pay a tiny part of their total cost but get an assurance those services are free."
5129,2020-12-30 00:01:13,kmevmq,"Well we will have to agree to disagree. I think that free markets tend towards higher quality and lower price. This is evident in most every good and service left to the free market. Thus, in a free market security market, better security would be more affordable."
5130,2020-12-30 00:08:08,kmevmq,"I think you're (deliberately or not) ignoring my point that taxation works as an equalizer. You're right that police may be higher quality and cheaper than today than their current 'cost per person', but *most* people pay far below that cost, and *some* people pay far *above* that cost. For someone who is a net zero contributor in taxes (aka the amount of value they receive in government services is the same amount of value they pay in taxes), you could get cheaper police of the same quality in a 'free market' system. But the net zero contributor is on the top 20% if not top 10% of people. 80%+ of people pay less for the government services than they receive, and this is especially true for poor people. So when you take that into consideration, for most people (especially poor, but working class and middle class too) police and other government services are cheaper (for the same quality) than they would be in a free market system because the top 10% pay 60% of the cost. Hope that makes it clear."
5131,2020-12-30 00:19:17,kmevmq,"I‚Äôm not ignoring your argument, I just don‚Äôt find it compelling. We fundamentally disagree that some people should have other people pay for the goods and services that they want. Or even that some goods and services are a right and should be provide at the expense of other people‚Äôs labor. I believe taxation is theft so you arguing how it is cheaper for some people because other people will pay for it is not convincing me that we should be taking money from the rich."
5132,2020-12-30 00:32:12,kmevmq,"Ah, but that is not the same as saying that the free market will provide poor people with better options than they currently have. That is saying that you don't care if their options become worse because you don't think the current system is fair. I suppose we both may agree that the current system is better for poor people, or even for most people, than a free market system, but you think it comes at a cost you don't think is fair. 

I'm a utilitarian, so I believe that a small sacrifice of a few well off people for the betterment of many people who are not well off is entirely good. I think taxation has greatly helped society, and as far as I know, any civilization without taxation (or another form of redistributive policy) has failed. You may disagree with me, and that is entirely fair, but our disagreement is about differing ethical values (apriorism vs aposteriorism primarily) and not about the effectiveness of tax-funded services."
5133,2020-12-30 00:40:29,kmevmq,"I do believe both. I believe a free market will have better outcomes and that taxation is theft.

1. Teach me how to flirt with rich guys, please and thank you.

2. We are the same age, chill, relax and find what brings passion to YOU. Don‚Äôt bother with men at the moment. I‚Äôm finding at our age they are either married/LTR or quite frankly they haven‚Äôt grown up. 

3. When you do date again find someone who wants to be with you more than anything else and that will put you at ease. Don‚Äôt waste your time with wishy washy guys who can‚Äôt make up their mind about you. It‚Äôs their loss. (In someways this is the nice thing about infjs, we are either 0% or 100% in and we let you know.)

4. Congrats gurl like damn a law degree and a ton of hours?!?! I have heard of women freezing their eggs and they felt it was such a relief to take those biological clocks out of their life. If you can afford it look into it, if not I‚Äôve also decided to adopt in 10 years regardless of if I have a partner in my life. 

5. Totally agree, I do wish there would be someone romantic to share time with or think of things for me but I just always end up taking care of that person instead. So lessons learned you are better off finding someone equal of your accomplishments and someone who knows how to plan and surprise you.

6. Until you find your person, in the meantime... https://youtu.be/knapGmpsxFQ"
5158,2020-12-27 00:45:18,kkqj4a,"Well  I respect anyone who has forged their own path. I'm ENTP 8w7 and a 21 year old male. I'm a young guy trying to become a fitness model. Have been/am a personal trainer etc. Finishing my degree for CS. But I want to pursue both tech and fitness as money making opportunities. I atleast want to work my ass off so that I can spend more time with my loved one and not have a boss. I only wrote that so you can understand some of my idealologies/viewpoints.

I relate with you very much in the idea that it's easy to get a lot of men or in my case women. If you act like what they want, they will like you enough to date. Or just look good(Iol most are shocked if u look good and are smart) and be relatively ""smart"" or have ""personality"". It's really sad that's all people need, over a very deep and powerful relationship. There's so much to the human brain and depth that these peoples relationships leave so much to want. Something so deep/strong even the tides can't wash it away. You wouldn't believe how accurate you are when I've heard men who are successful engineers with masters degrees or more say they want a ""smart"" woman. Meaning exactly what you said, just ""someone they can talk to"". It blows my f**king mind and pisses me off honestly. 

So saying all this I'd say fuck marriage/dating. As much as I get sad sometimes over others showing their ""love"" off-I know it's not for me . Which you probably agree with too. Any guy would be lucky to have you. Hell I'd be head over heels for you lol. I've found out that physical stimulation really does nothing  (through trial and error lol). I'm a sapiosexual so no matter how much people like the idea of me or I physically might like them, it becomes pointless. Also don't settle for that f**ktard of a man. It pisses me off that I have to see shitty men everyday with shit ideals, philosophies, and treatment of females. I don't care how much you make if you suck and still live in the ""matrix"" so to so speak. You seem much more indivualistic then him and stand out. Don't fall into the trap of settling for him. You would hate yourself more for failing to live up to your ideals, from what I understand about you. 

You're a catch in my eyes, and don't settle for someone just because they treat you like others. Maybe it's because I'm still young, but I will stand by this. I see, just like you, so many pointless relationships. I don't want that either and won't settle. Imo you shouldn't either. I hope you find someone that truly loves you and learns more about you each day. 

Lol sorry if I got too involved in this but I really felt for you."

It's like, when people say Trump is a liar, in essence that must be unfathomably true.

He definitely likes to be ""cute"" with his wording when dancing around those issues, and that phrase I wrote hearkens me back to his town hall and how the media mocked him for calling Savannah Guthrie ""cute"".  See, the media *tries* to be cute in the same way, but they are derisive and it's very obvious.

I know y'all motherfuckers don't party, and definitely don't party like rich people do, but her being in pictures with people doesn't mean they are in cahoots with each other. My facebook is full of party pictures with people whose names I don't even know. I took a picture together with a strange women because we had the same tattoo, and she used it as her profile picture for snapchat for like a week. If she later turned out to be a human trafficker, would y'all be making posts assuming I was complicit? Unless these pictures were taken at a party she hosted, and there were 13 year olds in bikinis serving hors d'oeuvres and beverages, I'm going to go out on a limb and just say she was only there for appearances and she and Paris Hilton aren't secret best buds and she probably isn't involved with human trafficking."

She lost her phone and a PI Found it and they analyzed the numbers and it was astonishing who she is in contact with, Mexican cartels, Saudi arms dealers, prostitution and local dirtbags in LA. All sorts.

5192,2020-12-27 02:25:18,kkmeme,"Being in the same photo as Maxwell or Epstein doesn‚Äôt seem to say much to me. They seemed to make it their purpose to mix in these circles. Now I‚Äôm not saying anything about Paris, but just in general 

But the issue she raises is an important one, and doesn‚Äôt just impact the children of the super wealthy. Years ago I saw stories on TV of how well off people would send their ‚Äòtroubled‚Äô offspring to Central American and Caribbean ‚Äòschools‚Äô that were very abusive. The laws in the countries were lax about child welfare."

For those on this sub now who are unaware (which should be a few people at this point unless you're new) Ghislaine Maxwell was a **sex trafficker** before her arrest who helped fellow sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein before his arrest and ""suicide""!

And Trump? This should raise many questions in my opinion."

She wasn't invited, i don't think. There is something about these two that is very important that isnt public knowledge. I don't know what that is though. Were they handlers? Mossad security team?

5222,2020-12-26 20:14:07,kkmeme,"She put out [a documentary](https://youtu.be/wOg0TY1jG3w) about her life recently and her time at Provo Canyon School is a major focus of it. It‚Äôs almost 2 hours long so I‚Äôm not sure if you‚Äôd want to watch, but it‚Äôs genuinely really pretty interesting as an examination of basically the biggest celebrity of the dawn of social media. If you just want to read, here‚Äôs [a link](https://www.today.com/popculture/paris-hilton-says-she-was-abused-boarding-school-teen-new-t190213) about it tho!

I'd imagine lots of people knew/know. Hell, WE know, and none of us have ever even spoken to any of these people. They were some of the most prolific and scary human traffickers in recent memory. Epstein himself was murdered, and people who tried to continue investigating had their children murdered by disguised postal workers.

5237,2020-12-27 01:23:32,kkmeme,"I mean the Simple Life was very funny and not meant to be taken seriously. She‚Äôs playing a character version of herself, and she genuinely does it pretty well. I mean there‚Äôs a scene where she stuffs multiple designer purses full of cooked crawdads, and then stores them in her RV overnight so she doesn‚Äôt have to do as much work the next day. I mean yeah the show is dumb, but her acting dumb for the sake of comedy doesn‚Äôt mean she‚Äôs dumb.

As far as the sex tape is concerned, her ex leaked it without her permission. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth passing such harsh judgement on her, the only judgement worth passing is on her sleazy ex for selling the sex tape. I mean I‚Äôm pretty sure she was like 18 when it was filmed.

The stuff she‚Äôs doing now is credible, and is genuinely good - she‚Äôs  raising awareness about the awful stuff that‚Äôs happened at Provo Canyon School and other schools that treat troubled kids so horribly."
5238,2020-12-27 01:04:21,kkmeme,"Of course! I personally just really like Paris and think she‚Äôs a really funny/kind person and wayyyyy more clever than most people give her credit for, so I like answering questions about her when I see them pop up in subreddits I‚Äôm active in! Her YouTube channel is worth checking out if you want a laugh too, I absolutely love [Cooking with Paris](https://youtu.be/ayImIgdgLEI) because of how aware she seems to be of her what most people think of her. No one can do Paris satire better than Paris, and I think it‚Äôs pretty interesting commentary on celebrity in general (this video is mostly just funny IMO). 

Conspiracy wise tho, it‚Äôs worth noting that her Dad, Rick Hilton, was named in (I think) Virginia Giuffre‚Äôs memoir as being associated with Epstein. The description she provides doesn‚Äôt seem to match what Rick Hilton actually looks like though. Also apparently Ghislaine Maxwell expressed interest in ‚Äúacquiring‚Äù Paris for Epstein when [Paris was 19.](https://filmdaily.co/obsessions/true-crime/epstein-paris-hilton/)"
