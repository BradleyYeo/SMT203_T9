1,2020-02-05 17:39:35,ez8vw5,Ken a damn liar calling Colin Kaepernick Kaepernigga and saying it was a Freudian slip lmaoo
2,2020-02-05 22:16:07,ez8vw5,I went on the frames per second episode expecting 30 extra minutes of content and it was like 2 minutes 😭
3,2020-02-05 16:34:55,ez8vw5,"Yo...Myke's story of an ex calling her old ass dad over computer buying  had me dying....lmao. I would be mad too.

And I cannot change brakes either. I am not remotely a car guy...RAM, or computer stuff though, I got ya."
4,2020-02-05 13:54:52,ez8vw5,Mad early with the pod .  Let’s gooooo
5,2020-02-05 16:32:34,ez8vw5,"u/Mykectown

Ken didn't list off Curb Your Enthusiasm (maybe he did in the full conversation), but I'm curious if Myke would like that one. I do like Seinfeld, but I like Curb far far more."
6,2020-02-06 00:19:33,ez8vw5,"re: the ""internal monologue"" convo, I think people are mixing up two different concepts when talking about the issue, and it makes it harder to understand where people are coming from. It's possible to have an internal monologue without literally hearing your voice in your own head. People can have those same types of thoughts without necessarily processing them in an auditory way. I'd definitely say I have an internal monologue - I think things through and I acknowledge my thoughts same as anybody else, I just don't ""hear"" myself saying them inside my head"
7,2020-02-05 17:49:39,ez8vw5,"Didn’t watch the Super Bowl but I wanted to. 
Also I haven’t watched since the boycott started, but somebody last week explained that if folks don’t watch the NFL does that mean we are taking money out of folks mouths that are black."
8,2020-02-05 17:07:08,ez8vw5,"&#x200B;

cant' get down with Ken's advice to BMF in their 20's and declare bankruptcy. Best to start saving/planning at that stage then trying to fix shit later. I'm in my mid 30's and BMF'd like a motherfucker. No bankruptcy or anything but I was more like Sophie and just spend, spend, spend...(still kinda do, sadly). Wish I had started planning/saving earlier."
9,2020-02-05 21:36:36,ez8vw5,"Myke’s Bojack reference gave me life.

As a black dude, if I can recommend some white TV to y’all, try Frasier, The Office, and The Mighty Boosh. All of them are pretty funny to me"
10,2020-02-06 19:59:50,ez8vw5,"Feefo having that realization that he was 25, 10 yrs ago and peeped he was getting up there in age had my crying"
11,2020-02-05 17:11:58,ez8vw5,Being there for your kids is different from pleasing them.

13,2020-02-05 19:08:09,ez8vw5,"The Terry Crews convo was very interesting, but I think ya'll might be letting Crews off the hook a little too much by focusing on the ""please"" part of it. It came off to me that Crews was just trying to wave off any accountability related to his comments on Gabrielle Union and America's Got Talent.

The guys (specifically Rod) definitely opened my eyes to that other perspective, but I think it is giving Crews too much credit. He was just shook about being called out on the Union thing and came off like ""fuck everybody but my wife"". Your wife can be #1, but that doesn't excuse you from not sticking up for those who stuck up for you (like black women stood up for crews and the abuse he endured)."
14,2020-02-06 17:00:55,ez8vw5,y'all was sounding mad egotistical like ya women has to follow your rule bc it's your house. real possessive like you own that woman
15,2020-02-07 11:45:16,ez8vw5,"I can't relate to being reckless in my 20s. I became a father at 14. My child's mother was 20 at the time. So you could imagine how my mother who happened to be a lawyer felt about that. I graduated high school 16 & I moved out the same day I graduated. I got my 1st apartment at 18. The only reason I was able to get that apartment was, because I paid the rent for a year in advance ($12k). I didn't get my 1st credit card until I was 30. There's nothing like stuntin on people with an Amex Platinum card."
16,2020-02-07 14:54:28,ez8vw5,"I feel like a lot of Americans are just addicted to watching the superbowl or football in general, whether they wanna admit it or not. I thinks it's easier to boycott most NFL games but the superbowl is something else. That segment was hella interesting tho"
17,2020-02-08 11:48:07,ez8vw5,My mother is currently married and has 5 brothers she still calls and depends on
18,2020-02-05 15:12:50,ez8vw5,"Was breaking up the TV conversation necessary? It was MAYBE 4 mins extra and I wanted to complete the conversation before moving onto the rest of the episode, assuming it was maybe 10 mins or so extra."
19,2020-02-05 17:26:00,ez8vw5,Nick nobody asked you if they were going to long! That’s was a good convo about TV shows. Now I have to find the frames per second finish up.
20,2020-02-05 15:28:12,ez8vw5,"I don’t understand the Nike example. Nike and Apple use sweatshop labor, I can guarantee everyone in the dead end studio was rocking some Nike apparel and an Apple product(s). Amazon has work laws that are so bad, people are threatening to commit suicide from their warehouses... I can guarantee Myke and Sophie and Rod are getting Amazon packages delivered weekly (because all Americans are). We all contribute in some way to a problematic society. This whole shit of pointing fingers and almost trying to shame people for their stances is weird tbh, specially when you specifically are not living up to that standard"
21,2020-02-07 08:50:23,ez8vw5,I can confirm the masks are for letting other people know that your sick and preventing you breathing on people spreading it. I will admit it didn't even think to do that until i went to Japan then it just felt like common sense. In London though people look at you like why do you get to have a mask and i don't it's really weird.
22,2020-02-07 10:52:04,ez8vw5,"When I do math equations in my head. My mind sees numbers floating in the air & I hear my mother's voice going through the equation. People get freaked out, because I look like Raven having a vision. Then I come back with an answer."
23,2020-02-05 16:39:48,ez8vw5,To bring up Kobe's allegation after he's no longer alive to defend himself is tasteless and unnecessary.  He didn't do it so be quiet.
24,2020-02-05 18:46:04,ez8vw5,"I'm glad you guys talked about Kobe's abuse on the show. I've seen lots of people downplay it but he straight up raped someone and even if he did a lot of great, heroic things, it still sucks for his victim to see his face everywhere with no acknowledgement of his crime."
25,2020-02-05 23:25:37,ez8vw5,"Hey how yall doin. About the Caucasian thing I didn't mean white people who tan, I meant some of the darkest skin people on earth like South Asians and certain Africans are also called caucasians. scientist and anthropologists (the experts) believe using Caucasian for white is incorrect but the us bureau doesn't. Myke, I don't get why after I said to u I wasn't comparing a nigger joke to a 'white guy voice joke' u still said I did. Btw u still haven't answered the question I've asked u for the eighth time now, would u be cool with a Native American, if we had the power in this country saying to ur face, 'man black people must be good at climbing trees cos they look like apes' or black people r too dark we can't see them'. This is cool with u?"
26,2020-02-06 00:41:04,ez8vw5,Stop playing
27,2020-02-05 16:34:40,ez8vw5,Curb is 1000% better than Seinfeld. He’s killing it on the new season too
28,2020-02-05 18:30:51,ez8vw5,I was hurt(not that serious). I love Seinfeld and it had nothing to do with Wale. Curb too.
29,2020-02-05 19:39:02,ez8vw5,"I thought that was kind of a valid point too, Myke said black people in the NFL just make that money because they’re fast and strong, not because the NFL cares about black people. Which is a fair point, but it’s a business at the end of the day, and if you starve the business you starve the employees. I’ve never watched a football game in my life though, so what do I know anyways."
30,2020-02-06 00:36:23,ez8vw5,So... Does that mean we can't boycott any companies that have black employees?
31,2020-02-05 23:13:48,ez8vw5,">  The Mighty Boosh

I have never seen anyone else EVER reference this show holy shit man. This isn't just a show you start watching, it's like a religion. You have to find it at 3am wasted out of your fucking mind not knowing what channel is playing"
32,2020-02-07 17:00:30,ez8vw5,It's weird that people will talk on what is or isn't pro black but happily watch the NFL. Like when Nick was saying you can't be pro black if you marry/date a non black person and yourself are black. Yet he loves watching NFL. How does he reconcile that stance whilst ignoring all the NFL bullshit?
33,2020-02-06 00:39:09,ez8vw5,"I hope this gets read next week, you put it so much better than I could. Nobody was asking him to ""please"" Gabrielle Union, that was such a weird response"
34,2020-02-05 15:39:27,ez8vw5,"That wasn't the point. I think you took that part a bit too literal. Everyone is complicit. A lot of people feel ways about things that directly affect them as opposed to things that they can cognitively separate themselves from. That's ALL the Nike example was. It wasn't a call to boycott Nike or to imply that none of us support fucked up companies. It was to see how far someone is willing to go if they fundamentally disagree with something. But, again, yes...you are totally correct...everyone contributes to trash companies. But that does mean that we should all just be like ""well, fuck it, let's just 100% contribute to every trash company regardless of if I can avoid it.""

And no I don't get Amazon packages delivered weekly. Haha! How could you possibly need that much shit?!"
35,2020-02-05 18:46:31,ez8vw5,"I think what makes it in bad taste to bring this up in death, is that the case did have legitimate holes. It had questionable moments like with her text msg to friends bragging about just having sex with Kobe. It wasn’t close to an open and shut case. If I were to be honest, the case read as a situation where the sex was consensual, but it was rough sex (choking, anal, etc). This could be a case of consensual sex turning to sexual abuse, but we really don’t know with texts like the text she wrote. 

But also, I saw so many people (mostly white women) calling him a “predator”. This was not a pattern of behavior like Weinstein or Cosby has proven to have. We have one questionable incident that we really do not know if he was innocent or guilty of. At the end of the day, we simply don’t know what really happened with all the evidence that was laid out. I’ma always judge people by a pattern of behavior. At least that’s what I’m learning to do, it’s best."
36,2020-02-05 16:47:26,ez8vw5,"Serious question. If the accuser had died, would you give her the same benefit of the doubt?"
37,2020-02-05 19:13:37,ez8vw5,"I haven’t listened to the episode yet, except for some of the snippets on Frames Per Second. Was that an uncomfortable conversation? I’ve seen a few people bring up the allegations after his passing, but it’s usually been as a way to demean the  people who were mourning or shocked at his death, so it’s left a really sour taste in my mouth. It’s also been people who normally excuse sexual allegations against people like Kavanaugh, so I’ve seen it come from an insincere place."
38,2020-02-05 18:43:52,ez8vw5,"He admitted it, he said he realized it was non consensual after the trial. 

It's been brought up after his death because people find it harmful to glorify an abuser without acknowledging his abuse. Imagine his victim constantly seeing her rapist on every tv screen, every social media post, everywhere being lauded as an infallible hero."
39,2020-02-06 00:14:04,ez8vw5,"Jesus, he does not want to answer your question. Move on"
40,2020-02-06 17:21:38,ez8vw5,You need to let this one go
41,2020-02-08 03:13:53,ez8vw5,"Seinfeld and Curb are both in a different league, I can't believe anyone found Friends funny. Same way I don't get Big Bang Theory or Two and a Half Men"
42,2020-02-06 00:46:25,ez8vw5,"So this wasn’t  my opinion so I won’t speak for them, also I was relating this message while still listening to the full podcast even before Nick made the statement.

I will say that yes we, as I am, can boycott companies that employe black folk. I think we have to organize when we do though. A boycott without specific goals and a plan, doesn’t accomplish anything. 

I would suggest you look up some of the things Bro the Bootz Riley is doing in California with orgnazing boycott, strikes and unions. If that’s some your passionate about.

Also when I say we I don’t mean anyone is monolithic."
43,2020-02-09 05:41:01,ez8vw5,get his ass (i fuck with nick tho)
44,2020-02-06 02:37:01,ez8vw5,"Exactly. It lead to a fun convo, but it stands that Terry Crews was still out of pocket in my opinion."
45,2020-02-05 15:41:01,ez8vw5,"Hey, I know a lot of people that pray to the church of consumerism and the god of Bezos."
46,2020-02-07 11:55:07,ez8vw5,Here in NYC they deliver groceries through Whole Foods. Now with the plastic bag ban going into effect in March. I imagine that more people will get groceries delivered. Paper bags & inclement weather don't mix. Especially if you don't drive.
47,2020-02-05 16:59:56,ez8vw5,Idk.  My bigger point is it's pointless to bring it up when he isn't alive to defend himself.
48,2020-02-06 00:30:12,ez8vw5,His obsession with Myke is actually getting kinda creepy.
49,2020-02-06 18:13:08,ez8vw5,How do u know wanna whether he wants to or not? Would u tell him to move on since he's going back and forth with me still?
50,2020-02-06 00:47:28,ez8vw5,"Thanks! I'm in Chicago, but I'll deffo look em up!"
51,2020-02-06 23:23:58,ez8vw5,Yeah it's really weird how they let him rock with that. His tweet was in response to the backlash so you can't erase the context of it. I feel like they were just focusing way too much on the phrase itself as opposed to the situation it was being used in.
52,2020-02-05 15:47:30,ez8vw5,"But weekly, bro? Hahaha! That's wild. I'm actually gonna ask the guys that next shoot cuz now I'm curious."
53,2020-02-05 17:15:24,ez8vw5,Idk why you didn't just say that then.
54,2020-02-06 13:36:11,ez8vw5,Definitely at least weekly for me.
55,2020-02-05 17:59:59,ez8vw5,I did.
56,2020-02-06 13:43:57,ez8vw5,You probably order weird shit like different hair creams and Slim Jims. And flavored chap stick. Hahaha!
57,2020-02-05 19:04:27,ez8vw5,"I really don't want to argue here, but I'm just saying that the last sentence of commentary totally wasn't necessary. I think you could have left it at ""why are we talking about this after he's dead"" and kept it rolling."
58,2020-02-06 13:44:34,ez8vw5,Wooooow lmao
59,2020-02-05 19:06:17,ez8vw5,You're right.

92,2020-02-03 06:31:56,ey2s6f,Probably a straight up brawler character and he'd be based off Kiryu Kazuma from the Yakuza series.
93,2020-02-03 08:57:10,ey2s6f,"Got downvoted in the past for this and I still don't know why.  
So, here is what my first PL will probably look like:  
  
* female V visually similar to Major Motoku Kusanagi from the 1995 film Ghost int the Shell
* background probably street kid
* will be a agily solo/netrunner with points in hacking, melee and sniper rifles
* playstyle stealth but lethal. sniping if sutable. if not then katana/nanowire/silenced pistol.
* stubborn and cocky. out there to proof a point.
* favored vehicle: Kusanagi bike 
  
A second playthrough could be male V ex corpo with most points in speech/charm who trys to avoid all combat by talking himself out of it."

95,2020-02-03 08:02:20,ey2s6f,"We haven't seen techie yet so this could change. I'm doing full RP with this and yes I'm a nerd:


*A nomad netrunner/solo hungry for corpo blood, he learned how to use guns since he was child living out in the badlands wasn't easy but it was the core reason why he's out for revenge to take back what's his.Through his time in the city he met some friends and learned how to netrun so that nothing can stop him.*

This calls for an "" unoriginal "" stealth/power character but I think as a first playthrough would love to follow this RP as much as possible if the game allows it"
96,2020-02-03 06:53:27,ey2s6f,"Probably Geralt as brawler

and John Wick as a Silent Assassin

and maybe Robert Downey Jr as a Hacker"
97,2020-02-03 08:55:51,ey2s6f,"My first playthrough will be definitely solo. I like the strong, Rambo-style gameplay. I will try to replicate the cinematic V looks. The new default V looks too nice to me."
98,2020-02-03 10:15:49,ey2s6f,"definitely Solo. Depends on the melee combat but I will definitely use a pistol, something strong, and AR probably. For melee weapon I'm not sure yet. I would use katana or knife, wakizashi maybe? Definitely I'm not going for Mantis Blades because I just don't like how they look. Still hoping for nano blades but I don't think they will appear. Guess I would lose ability to climb walls because of that then. Ah well. 

I'll definitely try to talk first, before I start shooting. Depending on the choice of responses I will try to go for some tough guy who doesn't talk much and is just badass and not afraid getting his hands dirty. Trying to become the best solo. Money comes first. ...well depends how much will we have because if it's like in RDR2 where you got thousands and don't have anything to spend it on, then the money isn't necessary."

I think part of the reason he got laughed at was if you look at his instagram it’s mostly him showing off his muscles, and then when challenged he cowered. If a man walks around showing off his muscles especially his size, people expect certain things.

Second thing is his not a women who could’ve been potentially overpowered by their attacker, he’s a very large and strong man. He wasn’t powerless.

When he said he’s a feminist I could see where this was going to go. Those feminists used him."

Charity Drive for Equal Justice Initiative

To help celebrate this occasion, the moderators of BPT are organizing a charity drive to support the [Equal Justice Initiative (EJI)](https://support.eji.org/give/153413/#!/donation/checkout). EJI provides legal representation for prisoners who may have been wrongly convicted of crimes, poor prisoners without effective representation, and others who may have been denied a fair trial. The folks at EJI are on the front lines of combating racial and economic injustice, as well as protecting human rights.  We want to recognize their valuable work this February.  For those who may have seen Just Mercy recently, Michael B. Jordan plays the founder of EJI, Bryan Stevenson, in the movie.

*He also said ' I can't speak for sexism because I’m not a woman, but I can speak on behalf of any racism comments. That was never my experience.'""*

This was after

[*Earlier this month*](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gabrielle-union-hairstyles-video-instagram-americas-got-talent-racism-a9246856.html)*, it was revealed that \[Gabrielle\] Union and fellow judge Julianne Hough were to leave the NBC talent show, after appearing on it for one season.*

*It was recently reported that both women were subjected to “excessive notes on their physical appearance” throughout their time on the show, with Union being informed that her hairstyles were “too black” for the audience.*"

Two, since he didn't experience those things he could have not said anything but he decided to throw Gabrielle Union under the bus with what he said. When Gabrielle Union was one of the actresses that supported him for speaking out about being sexually harassed when every male actor went literally dogged him for doing so. He did went on to say the only women he needs to speak up for and defend is his wife, not his mother, not his daughters, not another woman just his wife because other women have men to defend them."
116,2020-02-02 23:02:56,exqmuy,Thanks for the info. Seems like they're both trying to avoid answers and it seemed like raven was trying not be categorized as African american because no one days European american. Seems like she was trying to say she doesnt want to be called different a name and just American cause the name itself implies different.

161,2020-02-01 19:04:38,ex8rgz,He apologized. He also reiterated after the tweet got backlashed on that what he wrote came out wrong but he still believed that there should be a figure from both genders to look up to (like an aunt or uncle). It was a hard thing to summarize in 150 characters. He also said that same sex parents can successfully raise a child. He just believes that a child should have someone like an aunt or uncle to look up to as well.
162,2020-02-01 19:04:06,ex8rgz,And that the CCP is great. I honestly don't understand how someone can have beliefs that go against their own other beliefs.

It doesn't seem he meant the vibe that the post gave off which is why he deleted it. It could've meant that he supported CCP but it also could've been brownie points for his chinese followers.
169,2020-02-01 18:28:47,ex8rgz,That opinion is bullshit.

173,2020-02-01 19:04:37,ex8rgz,No one said he is evil they said his opinion is shit. And it is.
174,2020-02-01 18:41:14,ex8rgz,I don't have to respect anyone's opinion. I also didn't say he was evil.  He isn't a bastion of wholesomeness. By saying that a kid needs a male and female parent like they are vitamins means that he's shitting on and doesn't respect any other kind of parenting. So a single dad doesn't cut it? A single mom? A child needs love. There are same sex couples all over the world that raise great people. Gender doesn't matter. Caring and love matter.
175,2020-02-01 19:05:10,ex8rgz,No one has to respect other people's opinions especially when they're bulshit like yours and Terry's.

On that particular note, I do believe there is evidence that at least suggests a 2 parent household is a lot better than a single parent household. But nothing to support the idea that same sex parents are any worse than opposite sex."
181,2020-02-01 19:12:36,ex8rgz,I understand that a 2 parent system is the better and healthier option. I just think the way he worded it kind of shat on more than just same sex couples. It kind of inadvertently included a large group of really hard working parents.
182,2020-02-01 19:15:13,ex8rgz,"I gotcha man, and yeah I agree. I think the most important thing is to just have parent/s that give a shit. Who cares if its one, two, gay straight. Just love your kids."

200,2020-02-02 00:23:56,ex0st1,Did he ever acknowledge the China tweet?
201,2020-02-01 16:16:03,ex0st1,Ummm... there’s a lot more to it than that. You’ve glossed over a few stuff to make Terry the victim.

211,2020-02-02 01:28:57,ex0st1,"He gave the gist, but skipped a little back and forth and background.  

Gabrielle Union was one of the first people to come to Terry’s defense when he reported being sexually assaulted.  

Terry’s statement wasn’t only a “lack of support”, he essentially said he didn’t think the issues she had were real.  Since he is a behind the scenes member of the same show this was very invalidating. Publicly contradicting somebody’s claims is actively going against them, not just refusing to support them. 

Terry doubled down when Gabrielle first addressed his comments tweeting something like “the only woman I need to please is my wife”

His apology tagging Kevin Hart was seen by some as deflection, referencing a time somebody else was the bad guy and he was the good guy.  

His apology came after her new HBO show on which she has an EP credit was announced, which was seen by some as relevant to why he apologized (I personally doubt it was related)"

Can't just treat everyone equal, someone's gotta pay even if they had nothing to do with old racist stuff."
214,2020-02-02 11:15:12,ex0st1,"I probably didn't word it the best way, it kind of reads like I'm complaining about racism to white people only. Obviously I'm against any form of discrimination against anybody, it was just an observation of a lot of comments in that Twitter thread."

226,2020-02-01 00:43:02,ewy09v,This cancel culture sucks. Terry Crews literally said nothing wrong. All he said was that he had a different experience than her. By him now being shamed into apologizing it is devaluing his personal experience.

244,2020-01-31 02:30:19,ewg6yy,man that was a sorry ass tweet...🤦🏾‍♀️
245,2020-01-31 02:07:20,ewg6yy,I am throughly disappointed in him.
246,2020-01-31 03:28:19,ewg6yy,The author doesn't hold back.
247,2020-01-31 02:56:33,ewg6yy,It’s beyond disappointing. I feel like an idiot for supporting him. Such a betrayal!
248,2020-01-31 01:23:56,ewg6yy,All facts!!
249,2020-01-31 19:13:37,ewg6yy,"I thought his statement about only needing to be loyal to his wife was so odd.  Nobody was suggesting he shouldn't be loyal to his wife and TBF, I don't understand why their relationship (his loyalty to her) even entered the conversation.  One can be loyal to one's partner/spouse and still stick up for what's right...or they can do themselves a favor and not make any comment if they know they have nothing to add to a conversation that obviously needs to be held.  Gabby did it for him and did it beautifully. 


When I think about this, I think about his daughters and wonder how he would feel if they were marginalized about their hair or personal style.  Would he be pissed if his daughters were deemed as troublemakers and fired for speaking up about some alleged abuses they heard about or witnessed? Would he want his daughters to toe the line?"
250,2020-01-31 10:06:29,ewg6yy,Isn’t he the one who was sexually assaulted by a Hollywood agent? And spoke up during metoo?
251,2020-01-31 04:30:17,ewg6yy,"I'm just glad people are finally seeing it; dude is trash. Plus, I'll be honest, he's always hit me as a strong colorist, as well, but that's just me.

Also, why did I read the comments on that, knowing how many of them would be trash? Lol."
252,2020-01-31 14:16:11,ewg6yy,What did he tweet? I couldn't see it in the article.
253,2020-01-31 06:26:50,ewg6yy,"His behavior isn’t shocking to me . When do many black men (especially those in the industry) ever really black up black women , outside of pandering at their own convenience?"
254,2020-01-31 08:58:19,ewg6yy,"I called-out Crews on this sub recently, for being pro China, and got downvoted for it.

The internet puts people on a high pedestal, and these people get vertigo, and fall off. Time and time again.

I still think as a person he's as loveable as anyone else. But I really wish people would see cause and effect when it comes to stuff like this.

Keep worshipping people, and they will always come up short.  

Regardless of all the good they did in fact do."
255,2020-01-31 14:54:44,ewg6yy,What did he say?

262,2020-01-31 12:28:59,ewg6yy,a lot of black men called Terry on his fuckery ages before this situation came into play
263,2020-01-31 12:48:51,ewg6yy,">I called-out Crews on this sub recently, for being pro China, and got downvoted for it.

Yeah I think I saw this comment. I think it even got deleted or removed.  

>Keep worshipping people, and they will always come up short.

Yes. I used to really like Crews and I saw him as a positive role model for black men like myself (despite his homophobia which I think he eventually denounced) because he was vocal about his shortcomings, abuse and seemingly looked like a chill dude. 

To say I am disappointed by his comments about Gabriel Union is an understatement. And then he DOUBLED DOWN on it in the worst way ever. Awful."

265,2020-01-31 18:38:17,ewg6yy,"It wasn’t as if they were calling him out for misogyny or homophobia, it was the opposite. The only thing approaching fair criticism was his playing “one of the good ones” online including reddit. Y’all love taking credit even when you missed the mark now and way back then. Him behaving like Neil deGrasse Tyson (online) should have been all you needed to know, not his support of #MeToo (or LGBT)."
266,2020-01-31 18:33:02,ewg6yy,"Those black men were mostly shitting on him because he supported MeToo, not because he was anti-black (women)."
267,2020-01-31 17:08:10,ewg6yy,"I don’t keep up with him. The only time I started paying attention was when he said he had been assaulted also. Other than that, I knew him as the penny pinching dad from everybody hates Chris"

Guess I shouldve specified though. I thought is was obvious since the HK protests, and disgusting behavior from their government, was on the frontpage for weeks on end.

All of it is just too ironic. Crews understands his own victimhood enough to fight for justice, but when it comes to other people, his empathy is short lived it seems.

That, or he's too old/too naive to understand. But then still it's a pity, and rightfully so people don't put up with it."

273,2020-02-01 00:29:04,ewg6yy,"i thought they started calling him out over the DL Hughegly beef? How he went after other black people instead of his white attacker

If they were attacking him for supporting Me2 thats really ignorant and shitty"
274,2020-01-31 01:55:48,ewf0jr,"On fact two, if she supported him then the least he could done was not shit on her, especially since he can't guarantee her accusations are false. The best thing for him to do in this situation was to just be quiet about his subject."
275,2020-01-31 00:47:11,ewf0jr,"From Afropunk to the white folks on Huffington Post, most people in the social media scene seem to share the same feeling as Joe on that 2nd point. I know plenty of people saying the same myself. Crews can’t go complaining about how only black women supported him while black men dissed him all to go out his way to dismiss Union’s race issues on that show. He literally didn’t need to say anything. His image in general doesn’t help much being the good ol’ boy white folks love."
276,2020-01-31 12:41:33,ewf0jr,When Jay Z was cooning for the NFL and telling Black NFL Players “we’re past kneeling” get back to work where was all this vitriol from Joe then he was on some “let’s wait and see” shit
277,2020-01-31 15:22:22,ewf0jr,"Terry is def a weirdo and just going out to defend his company but I agree with what you're saying. Is it really necessary to say his assault either didn't happen, if it did happen he wanted it, or if he didn't want it, he liked it? Like WTF. You can bash Terry without taking it to that level. 

Joe's take on standing with black women while he was KILLING Ari Lennox a couple of weeks ago is pretty hilarious."
278,2020-01-31 15:50:33,ewf0jr,"Whether Terry wanted it or not (that’s a wild reach by Joe, I agree), we cannot know. But Terry is doofy for how he treated Gabby, straight up. This is the same dude who wanted to world to stop spinning because he was inappropriately touched by a white dude with power over him. And I stand with him on that! But to go out of your way to basically call Gabby liar is nasty. And for what? To protect his bag? Like others have mentioned, he could have just as easily not said anything, regardless if Gabby supported him in the past or not. Terry can get the fuck outta here."
279,2020-01-31 17:58:45,ewf0jr,"Idk if I fully disagree with his take that Terry Crews is full of shit...  


But yeah, dude was off base as fuck on most of the shit he was saying about that...and how he was saying it."
280,2020-01-31 03:23:26,ewf0jr,"I fucking hate reddits boner for Terry Crews. It really shows the disregard most of this site has for women in general. The #metoo movement really should have been a time to talk about the treatment of women SPECIFICALLY and what happens? This site holds up Terry Fucking Crews as some leader for it. Terry Crews is the #alllivesmatter of the sexual harassment issue. 

If you find yourself caping for Terry Crews and not going 10x as hard for the women that have been victimized you need to take a long hard look at yourself. 

I agree with everything Joe said about the situation and I really thought I was the only one until recently. He needs to go and sit his coonin ass down somewhere. 

He could have just said nothing. But massa made him parade his dumb ass out there to talk about how ""massas always been good to me"". This dummy went in front of every camera he could find to talk about some drunk dude half his size grabbing his dick once. Hey Terry!! Sit back, shut up, and let the women be heard in this situation. The ones that have actual violence attached to their harrassment!! 

I'm glad Joe said that and I knew there'd be some reddit dickheads who would rush to the defense of their favorite sambo."
281,2020-01-31 07:19:40,ewf0jr,You’re leaving out that joe said terry has a rep for letting ppl do that kinda shit to him to get roles or whatever
282,2020-01-31 01:57:46,ewf0jr,"If he fully believes she’s wrong, you think he should be quiet on it because she supported him in the past? You and I might do that, but if your moral compass is true then you will say what u think is right no matter what that person has done for you in the past🤷🏽‍♂️"
283,2020-01-31 14:44:20,ewf0jr,"But you completely misinterpreted what Jay said. He didn’t say their past kneeling so get back to work. He said their past kneeling so now let’s take action. Whether you feel like the “action” is effective or not is a different story. It’s not like if we just kneeled for 20 more years and only that, shits would change. At some point, there does need to actually be action or change."
284,2020-01-31 03:27:07,ewf0jr,">The #metoo movement really should a been a time to talk about the treatment of women SPECIFICALLY 

this is pretty dumb my guy, if it's happening to both men and women (as terry crews alleges) then we should just ignore the molestation of men because.... theyre men? the metoo movement was against people in power using their power to molest, why does it matter the gender of the victim?

>If you find yourself caping for Terry Crews and not going 10x as hard for the women that have been victimized you need to take a long hard look at yourself. 

Victims of rape are 10x more important when they're female than when they're male. Gotcha. People like you are the reason male victims of rape don't report it, because societal stigma makes it seem like men being raped are 10 times less important than women being raped."
285,2020-01-31 12:47:54,ewf0jr,Joe doesnt know what he's talking about. He gets his info from rumors.
286,2020-01-31 02:03:06,ewf0jr,Even in his statement he said that he doesn't know what exactly happened between AGT and Gabrielle Union. The only thing he can speak on is that AGT treated him well. If he had evidence that she's lying then by all means expose her but he doesn't and still shitted on someone that supported him when some people were doubting his story.
287,2020-01-31 10:43:06,ewf0jr,"Lmao moral compass? Oh please, these people only care about their pockets"
288,2020-01-31 14:55:16,ewf0jr,You missed my point Jay was shucking and jiving in front of master (Roger Goddell) same as Terry Crews was doing for his Show
289,2020-01-31 03:33:32,ewf0jr,#alllivesmatter
290,2020-01-31 14:04:04,ewf0jr,Maybe. Maybe not
291,2020-01-31 03:32:05,ewf0jr,"Nah man dont you get it? How dare anyone bad mouth reddits favorite sambo. 

Of course we need to hear from Terry Crews about his personal experience even though it could be completely different than what Gabrielle experienced. How could his morals not have him rush to defend massa even though he has no specific evidence, just ""they always treated me right so I'm sure massa treats everyone right""

Terry Crews is great at making everything about himself. 

Fuck Terry Crews."
292,2020-01-31 15:11:06,ewf0jr,"If he said what you said, that would be true, but he didn’t say what you said. So it makes a huge difference in your argument."

294,2020-02-01 16:21:15,ewf0jr,"Kneeling was taking action, and still is. Thats why he was shucking and jiving, these men had their families and careers threatened for peaceful protests, and jay z inserted himself into their movement and then accepted a paycheck from the institution that persecuted these athletes, if you think we should take action thats cool, dont benefit off of the movement . Just my opinion though."
295,2020-01-31 03:48:24,ewf0jr,Also I'm not going to immediately downvote you like you did to me... because I'm not childish.
296,2020-01-31 03:43:22,ewf0jr,"You didnt make a valid point so I chose not to address but here it is. 

The reason I kept bringing up all lives matter is because sexual violence against men in this world is a fraction of what it is against women. If you disagree with that then we'll have to agree to disagree and move on. If you agree with that then I would hope you would understand how seeing terry crews jump in front of every camera he could find to talk about the one time a man half his size groped him and the subsequent lionization of him throughout this site seems like an insulting gross distraction. Let the women speak. I'm a black man right, and it always disgusted me when I would see black issues not being taken seriously until they had a white cosign. So again. 

Fuck Terry Crews."
297,2020-02-03 17:40:10,ewf0jr,"I’m asking y’all what would years of kneeling do with no action? There’s absolutely nothing kneeling can do without a follow up action. If you are so worried about him taking a paycheck then where’s that energy for the players that kept taking their paychecks from the league? Nobody is kneeling now, the next action should’ve been for the players to boycott the league. 

Plus Jay-Z just had the NFL give criminal justice reform 100mil. Some moves he makes are better than others. The only other action besides players boycotting, was putting someone in color to oversee racial issues like this to advise those out of touch old white people. I don’t think Jay was the guy for the job, but it was some type of action to actually/hopefully not allow that kind of bullshit to happen again."
298,2020-01-31 04:13:03,ewf0jr,didn't downvote you lol

I have no need or respect for any more of your opinion on the subject. It's just more needless distraction. The fact that I've even spent this much time talking about Terry Cruz and his coonin ass kinda makes me sick. So respond if you want but I'm kinda just done.

But since you seem pressed, I’m not going to be shamed into avoiding bringing my race, gender, and/or sexuality into the conversation when relevant. Nowhere in my reply did I speak on behalf of anyone else, and I’m fairly certain the word I used more than any other was “I”."
319,2020-02-01 00:03:33,ew8313,See now; nobody out here thinking Ellen is doing a good job.
320,2020-02-01 14:31:41,ew8313,Guess we’ll have to agree to disagree.
321,2020-01-30 15:11:47,ew6qgr,Just cut them out of the conversation. Feminists (and other victim advocates) have defended male victims since before MRAs used youtube to become popular. Cooperate with men's lib types. Let the conversation continue - with anyone willing to genuinely engage.
322,2020-01-30 16:10:42,ew6qgr,Absolutely not. I'm interested in any conversation about male victims that doesn't a) erroneously blame feminists/women and b) doesn't attempt to squash the concurrent conversation about female/NB victims.
323,2020-01-30 15:22:21,ew6qgr,"It's a fine line I guess. They've dominated the discussion on this issue so much that when male feminists talk about it people immediately think they're an MRA. This happens on r/menslib a bit too. People there talk about male victims, but they're hyper-concerned of potential MRA talking points popping out and the mods go crazy. 

Especially if it's a male feminist *group*. A bunch of dudes advocating for male victims is going to draw immediate suspicion. 

I think the only way male victims would ever be taken seriously is if a male celebrity speaks out and then other male celebrities spoke out."
324,2020-01-30 16:28:47,ew6qgr,I honestly wonder why they even blame feminists though. I've never seen a feminist say male victims matter less or that male victims shouldn't come forward.
325,2020-01-30 16:26:54,ew6qgr,Unfortunately a lot of MRAs will post/comment on r/menslib and pretend to be male victims.
326,2020-01-30 22:40:54,ew6qgr,Figuring out a way to improve things & then working to make it happen doesn't require public acknowledgement. Feminists have accomplished many things without requiring the approval or celebration or the general populace. There's no reason genuine activists who are male can't do the same.
327,2020-01-30 16:49:11,ew6qgr,"The simplest answer is that their movement is based around reactionary anti-feminism first, and actually helping men a distant second. The premise of feminism being harmful is always going to be foundational."
328,2020-01-30 12:29:21,ew4oik,Doubt he took classes...just something you learn how to do..like wiggling your ears.  Cant be sure though
329,2020-01-30 12:52:01,ew4oik,"It's a technique used in popping + locking. Idk if Terry Crews has experience in that, but if you talk to a hip hop teacher they could probably give you some pointers."
330,2020-01-30 13:14:12,ew4oik,"Just develop muscle, it comes pretty natural."
331,2020-01-30 14:01:54,ew4oik,It's pretty easy to do; your muscles just have to be pretty big for the effect to be noticeable.
332,2020-01-30 14:12:57,ew4oik,"It's just something you can learn on your own. For example, I can do the chest thing like him even though I'm a girl, you just kinda try and try and try again and after some time you can do. Also you can do this with the muscles on your face, I was always able to raise my right eyebrow but never my left on it's own, so I tried and tried and now they can move independently from one another"
333,2020-01-30 12:32:26,ew4oik,people can wiggle their ears?!?
334,2020-01-30 13:55:08,ew4oik,Terry Crews has some GREAT [dance moves](https://youtu.be/H6hgGIdLOpE)! Love him in everything but this is one of my absolute favourites of him.
335,2020-01-30 12:32:51,ew4oik,Lol...now you've got 2 things to learn
336,2020-01-29 17:53:52,evnzxw,"I didn't know the details of her firing and looked online for them.

https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/why-gabrielle-union-was-let-go-at-americas-got-talent.html#comments

NOW I KNOW!"
337,2020-01-29 15:03:34,evnzxw,"A disappointing take from Crews, who needs to do better when it comes to sexism and misogynoir. He should know well better than “it didn’t happen to me so it must not happen”. Gabrielles twitter responses were exactly right, and she called this out well.

From the article, nor after the jump:

I wish I didn’t have to write this post, but I do. In November, Gabrielle Union was let go from her contract after only one season as a judge on America’s Got Talent. We learned simultaneously that Gabrielle had been very vocal about the toxic environment working on the show, most of which boiled down to racism and sexism. In the wake of Gabrielle’s dismissal, her AGT co-workers remained mum, including Terry Crews, the show’s host, who was held up by WOC and his co-workers when he came forward with his sexual assault. One of the first to defend Terry in his time of need was Gabrielle. And she continued her support after he testified in front of Congress.

Last week, Terry broke his silence on the matter of Gabrielle’s claims against AGT. He appeared on Today, when he was asked about the situation and Terry took the opportunity to publicly defend AGT."

355,2020-03-23 02:26:19,fnay7o,"Not really that clever. 

Terry had a bad experience with porn and his own lack of self control. Like lots of people the demonize the object and not themselves. 

Is there bad porn out there? Sure. Tons of it. Is there porn that exploits children? Sure. But by demonizing the whole industry the way Terry does it just (IMO) shows his weakness and unwillingness to look at the fault within himself. 

It's possible to talk about porn addiction and the problems that porn can bring into people's lives without shitting on all porn and all people that use it.

People always want to blame objects. The food made me fat, the cigarettes gave me cancer, social media made me depressed. People are in control and can stop or adjust. When they lack that self control it's always something elses fault."
356,2020-03-23 16:39:58,fnay7o,Just because *your* porn addiction destroyed *your* love doesn’t mean you get to blame the whole industry

361,2020-03-23 03:53:08,fnay7o,"Very well said! And so very true.  Our very culture is tied into “it’s not my fault,” which is a huge problem that leads to bigger problems. 

Every women and girl has been subjected to “don’t wear that it distracts the boys” which takes the control away from men. And Terry is usually the one advocating for changing that considering his own harassment story. Shame he doesnt see the hypocrisy"
362,2020-03-23 17:09:47,fnay7o,The industry suffers severely from people who are happy with their lifes
363,2020-03-23 02:33:37,fnay7o,That I do. I even watch it with my wife sometimes. So Crews shirt makes zero sense in my experience.
364,2020-03-23 02:34:14,fnay7o,this guy wants us to think he doesn't. But we all know he does.
365,2020-03-23 17:32:43,fnay7o,People can be happy with their lives and still watch porn... your logic makes no sense lmaoo
366,2020-03-23 18:34:48,fnay7o,Though it appears that people who have a life earn the porn companies a lot less ad revenue.
367,2020-03-24 09:38:11,fnay7o,"What you’re saying has literally nothing to do with the post, try again. There are plenty of people who have a life that also watch porn. Not everyone who watches porn is addicted"

Acho que a internet exagerou aí irmão.
Mas mesmo que fosse verdade acho que as pessoas tem o direito de defender o governo que quiserem, mas eu saquei que é só mais uma briga de capitalismo x comunismo que o povo adora.

Tu manda um link extremamente tendencioso (e meio fora de hora para ""cancelar"" alguém quando o pessoal só quer ver uma sériezinha) e o problema é comigo? O post do Terry Crews não tem a ver com o Uighur — como os tweets selecionados desesperadamente tentam fazer parecer — e sim com Hong Kong, que aqui foi vendido como ""manifestações pela democracia"" quando não se trata disso também. O Terry Crews é condenado por esse post e tratado como irrecuperável pela mídia daqui e por você, que comprou a narrativa, mas não existe o mesmo ultraje e indignação quando se trata dos centros de detenção para imigrantes nos Estados Unidos que, por alguma razão, não são chamados de campos de concentração também pela mesma mídia. Eu estou falando de controle de narrativa aqui e que certas coisas só são importantes no ocidente quando há interesse. Estou propondo um exercício de **crítica**, não de negacionismo.

Me preocupam mais o identitarismo, o doisladismo e a cultura de cancelamento em voga que atrapalham e anestesiam qualquer tipo de mobilização real, na verdade.

470,2020-03-18 17:52:19,fkbwg3,"> que aqui foi vendido como ""manifestações pela democracia"" quando não se trata disso também

o povo tava literalmente se manifestando por garantias democráticas simples, como o direito ao devido processo legal.

> indignação quando se trata dos centros de detenção para imigrantes nos Estados Unidos que, por alguma razão, não são chamados de campos de concentração também pela mesma mídia.

campos de detenção são campos de concentração e guantanamo é um crime contra a humaniade. a invasão do iraque violou a convenção de genebra. tá feliz agora?

I loved Gina in the first 2.5 seasons but after a while I found her over powering scenes and the escalation of her character was becoming ridiculous. I'm glad she was written out in a very Gina way. 

My favorite thing is Boyle and how being awkward is like breathing for him"

Best thing we can do from there is not continue the cycle and to get the mental help before it causes our children (or nieces and nephews in my case) to have the same abuse, and to make sure they grow up with mental checks in place to help them."

631,2020-04-20 14:06:59,g4i9xn,"This guy just spouts off random ""wholesome"" bs to generate likes and upvotes. Especially annoying that he's essentially posting a thinly veiled ad for a toy company, who's probably paying him. 

He seems like a good dude, sure, but this is just promoting consumerism. It's like if Tom Hanks posted a picture of tide pods with a caption that said ""Sometimes we get a little roughed up in life, but Tide Brand Tide Pods taught me that you can always clean yourself up! You're not dirty, you're just unwashed!"""
632,2020-04-20 14:06:41,g4i9xn,"Terry Crews does NOT belong here. Look, I love the guy. I bet he’s got an awesome personality and would be hella fun to hang out with. Makes everything and everyone feel better. But he’s got a double persona. He’s an SJW that supports the perpetual victimhood mentality and race/sex baiting. I noticed it first when he gave account of his own molestation and stood along with the “Believe Women” thing. He used that experience to formalize himself as a modern feminist. A supporter of victimhood.

So on one hand he espouses self-reliance and responsibility but on the other hand he holds on to support the claims that people are perpetually disadvantaged based on biological attributes. That’s counterproductive and counterintuitive. And that’s why although I still love the guy, I can’t quite claim him as inspirational anymore. 

If you want an example of what I’m talking about give a listen to this “racist radio” show. (That’s what I call stations whose entire premise is to continue espousing racism as the primary factor in life)

There are plenty of metaphors within this to explore. Like how if you take the time to learn about the individual pieces that make the whole (like parts of yourself) you can create better things with your time. Or looking at how many pieces and which ones you have can allow you to see which pieces you need to make something new (what do I need to better myself?). 

And, have you seen how tidy his room is? He's even got photos of his shoes on the outside of his airtight shoe boxes. /s"
641,2020-04-20 14:24:45,g4i9xn,"You can't be serious and write something like this. Terry Crews had very good intentions for this post. He openly stated that he suffered from pornography addiction.

650,2020-04-20 14:05:04,g4i9xn,Yes and now Terry actively campaigns against porn.
651,2020-04-20 14:26:26,g4i9xn,I don't really care if you're mad or not. I'm just stating that this post feels like an advertisement. And I don't respect people that use their good reputation to promote product.
652,2020-04-20 16:37:50,g4i9xn,Yeah that why I say I still like the guy. But he definitely does not belong “here”. One of our lessons is to learn and accept ourselves. People like Terry Crew are too two-sided to along with that lesson. You can’t be espousing to be the master of your own future yet still be claiming that your future is inherently limited by your birthright. The two concepts do not mesh well logically. Listen in the video that I linked how he literally says that in Charlottesville you still can’t get a job “if you’re black”. Like what kind of self-empowering message is that?! It is both ignorant and pandering. I guess according to those racist standards then black people in that town must be at 100% unemployment rate.
653,2020-04-20 13:46:49,g4i9xn,"I don’t know but my guess would be Terry Crews doesn’t know shit about politics, especially what’s going on in China. I’d assume he meant well, just looks foolish based on ignorance. Which isn’t excusable but it’s better than the alternative."
654,2020-04-20 18:02:22,g4i9xn,"My point is that’s got nothing to do with this at all. The message of this post belongs here and that’s what is here. The rest of it isn’t here.

Edit: I’ve been completely stupid and was just reading the content of his post and not the title which is what you were disagreeing with. I get where you’re coming from now, definitely my bad. Thanks for still being nice in the face of my stupidity."
655,2020-04-20 19:12:11,g4i9xn,"Nah, not stupid. I dig the message. And in many cases there is much about him that is inspirational. But you’re right, I was arguing against him as a whole belonging here. Personally, I think he is a great inspirational personality. But that’s as much the blessing as the curse. By elevating him as a person then he may inspire people to find themselves and stand up for themselves, but he would also inspire people into believing that others will always victimize them. Hence, my argument against idolizing Crews himself. If you want to pick a lesson here or there then I’m all for it. I really really like the guy. But that’s as far as I can push his message, anecdotally. 

Thanks for understanding."

...but that's pretty unfair as a rule....  I don't live with that insanely disproportionate mindset, so I do not have the additional pain of guilt when I fap that I have doomed myself.

I just feel a bit shitty for a day, but then I learn, I keep learning and I try again and remain happy.  

See the difference?

No guilt required.  Shame I think comes from the fucked up porn, and you must learn not to watch fucked up porn....  and less and less extreme,,,and soon none.

I used to watch porn myself, because it is easier to get off when you are watching people have sex and I liked to watch boobs, which is REALLY weird considering I am not even BI (never had feelings for a woman at least). I didnt know any better.

Problem with porn is, it messes with your brain in a VERY severe way and the industry is honestly AWFUL- it is filled with human trafficking and many sites such as pornhub has child pornography present..... 

A quick overview to get you started:

738,2020-04-14 16:31:12,g0hfcf,">Is something wrong with me for watching it?


Humans are hard wired to enjoy sex, so no. The problem with porn is that the industry itself overwhelmingly preys on the emotionally vulnerable and compromised. It abuses women and gaslights them into accepting it. It treats the men in the industry like shit. They know they are marketing to minors and don't particularly care. Some producers intentionally seek out under developed women to portray acts that could only leave you with the impression that they're under-aged. Websites like Pornhub stretch the 'platform, not producer' legal classification to it's limit when it can take *days* for them to remove porn from their website that is illegal. 


Sex is great, you should have lots of it with a committed partner. Your hand isn't a committed partner, nor is any particular toy. Dry spells happen, *masturbation* is fine. Porn is not. 


>Is there a certain amount that is okay and healthy?


Not particularly, no. You should have adult relationships with adults. Adults you actually know, for that matter. I will say that not all porn is made equal and I'll even concede that it's at least marginally more ethical to consume drawn porn because that at least minimizes the damage to the artist and the consumer. But broad strokes? No. Unless you're illustrating what you want your sexual partner to do to you, or you're illustrating what you're about to do to them there's no reasonable argument for porn.


And even in that example I gave I'm hesitant to recommend it because porn isn't real. Those are actors, they're intentionally hamming up the experience. If you're about to have sex you shouldn't be shy about discussing what you actually like and dislike, visual aids shouldn't be necessary. 


>Is something wrong with you if you enjoy some of the hardcore stuff/bdsm, but would never pressure anyone into that sort of stuff if they’re not comfortable?


This is one of those things where there's a bit of a spectrum to it. I say BDSM is fine but it comes with an enormous asterisk. The BDSM stuff *I* do is fine, but it's also incredibly tame and the root of what I do is to teach and demonstrate trust instead of breaking out the whips and bits.


That said, BDSM communities are often rife with problems. Many shitty ones don't properly teach consent, many of them legitimately attract sociopaths and weirdos because they think that their shitty attitudes- both men and women- are tolerated. Tons of dweebs who think it's an easy way to get sex, too. I've known of more than one BDSM community that had to ban non-gay male subs who didn't already have a dom because they were an enormous problem and had zero concept of personal space. 


And of course it also becomes a refuge for people with mental trauma. I'm all for finding ways that work for you to address your mental hangups but the bedroom isn't really the place to sort your head out. I've had to tell more than one sub that I am not their therapist and that if they need help, they need to go to a professional. I don't mind *helping* them but even as a dom I actually draw the line at physical abuse in the bedroom. 


Plus the thing about kinks and fetishes is that a lot of people who claim to actually like them don't understand that the reason it feels appealing to them is the novelty of it, and the simple fact that they're not *supposed* to like it. Either that or you came in on the bandwagon- nothing wrong with that in itself- and were given an completely unrealistic depiction of what a fetish is actually like thanks to something like 50 Shades of Gray."

It is true that there's a ton of studies that try to point out the health risks associated with porn abuse that have suspect standards and are instead mostly talking points for religious organizations.

745,2020-04-13 02:58:17,g090as,"Basically, to cut people out of video, what you're looking for is called rotoscoping. That is where they mask out the object of person frame by frame. However, if the background is a relatively solid color - while the same color is not present on what you're cutting out - you can use a process called chroma key. That is what using a green screen is called (but you can easemtially do it with any color.

You would need a compositing software like After Effects to pull that off though."
746,2020-04-13 11:05:34,g090as,"automatic rotoscoping. davinci resolve does this. not perfect, but you can tweak it slowly and save time instead of doing frame by frame - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4xCHkFqg-4

747,2020-04-13 05:05:44,g090as,"There are several ways. Yo don't really need AE to do that you can do that in Premiere Pro with so called opacity masks. Basically you can remove some parts of screen depending on their characteristics. Opacitiy masks also called mates. I did that even in Premiere elements.

749,2020-04-13 13:09:28,g090as,"I think you're talking about rotoscoping. Automatic Rotoscoping is available in most high-end softwares.  Manual Rotoscoping (If you're decent at it) looks better imo. After Effects, Premiere, DaVinci Resolve, etc etc..."
750,2020-04-13 15:04:04,g090as,"Heyo, glad you enjoyed the collabs! I helped work on all the videos / collabs you've mentioned, so I can provide a little more insight. I can say enineci's comment is pretty much correct -- either the footage is keyed or manually rotoscoped, and just about everyone doing visual production on these uses After Effects, and a few cases of Fusion, Nuke, etc.

Usually we aren't terribly concerned about being 100% accurate and try to figure out a way to ""key"" things before rotoscoping, because rotoscoping is going to be the most time consuming. Most collabs try to alleviate this by keying and rotoscoping as much material beforehand and then sharing it among participants, so they can focus on actual visual production.

As some examples:
The Jack Black video is against a blue background, and nothing else in the video is blue, so that can be easily keyed. Some tweaking and garbage masks have to be created to account for clouds and the edges of the frame but there isn't too much manual work here.

For the Old Spice videos, most are commercials that have a static background composited in, and some of those commercials have at least one frame where it's only the background, so you can use that background as a difference matte to get a pretty good cutout that only needs minimal cleanup. Brief example of that here: https://twitter.com/MowtenDoo/status/627989497611825152

There's multiple other techniques to get a good key, another example would be keying with HSL, example of that here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_A7kmfKex8
(After Effects' equivalent to this is Lumetri Color, which has a HSL key tool)

Worst case scenario, it's rotoscope time. And for best results I wouldn't recommend the rotobrush tool in After Effects, but if speed is more of a concern then it's fine.

Apologies if this is a little too wordy. Hope my rambling helps in some way at least!"

Trevor Noah is an actor?  Who knew?  I thought he's a comedian and TV host.

Okay, looked it up, he's had small appearances in a few movies and TV shows.  But by no stretch of the imagination would ""actor"" be the word most people would think of when describing him.  I have no idea what his stance is on gun control, although that his father shot his mother (she survived) might be in the mix.  I doubt his views on that issue were a factor in EA hiring him, and you assuming that it was seems a bit desperate.

Some braindead exec at EA figured Noah was the sort of young, hip figure they wanted pimping BFV.  If that was the worst mistake they made in BFV I'd be delighted.  Sadly they made much more serious blunders than that."

>He clearly mocked all of Battlefield with his snide comments.

He is a professional comedian. They make snide comments all the time.

>historical first person shooter.

I think you got the wrong series. Battlefield was never a historical FPS.

It is a sandbox shooter that is set in different eras. Many of which involve **FICTIONAL** conflicts.

* BF1942 had quite a few fictional battles.
* BF2 & BF2MC were pretty much all fictional, same with BF3 & BF4 & BFP4F.
* Battlefield Vietnam was mostly straight, albeit with a shit ton of unrealistic shit you could do.
* BF2142 was a futuristic shooter before futuristic shooters became the norm.
* BF1 was heavily exaggerated and had several fictional battles.
* Battlefield Heroes was 100% a fictional and absurd mess
* Battlefield Bad Company series is also a very fictional game.

The only one closest to ""Historical FPS"" would be Battlefield 1, solely for the fact it had the ""Codex"". 

Which is ironic, as DICE lampooned the hell out of WW1 with their first FPS ""Codename Eagle"".

Almost every player who’s played Battlefield over the years expected an accurate and grounded game. Normandy, Stalingrad, Dunkirk, Etc. big stuff.

This is not some future pseudo-war simulator programming our youth, correct. I didn’t expect a dissertation from you, that works really well for the readers. 

So, we have DICE or EA hiring this guy Mr. Noah, a comedian, to... make fun of their own game. Yes. Because we can all see how funny this is for the investors. #NotMyPennies

I have been playing battlefield for a long long time.

Even having old emails from DICE promoting BF games before the shift to the frostbite engine.

If WW2 is your baseline for ""historical fps"" then Dino D-day, Battlefield Heroes and Wolfenstein must be historical too.

Im not here to defend anyone, I am just here to point out that accuracy was never the aim of the series. The series is about mindless fun.

Like being able to jump out of a plane far above ground level and hearing your soldier audibly shit themselves before hitting the ground.

Considering I run a community of milsimmers, I can say that BFV in fact ""FEELS"" like WW2. 

maybe not in your silly public lobbies. but in private matches it has 100% ""Dubya Dubya Tuuueee"" Feeling.

The problem is, you and the others stick to public lobbies and expect arma level of play from people who share completely different ideals on what Battlefield is at it's core.

You need to find some like minded people to play with, instead of relying on joining matches that have casuals and comp teams.

837,2020-04-09 01:28:24,fxj8be,"Michael Jackson is the greatest human being of all time. I think he's better than Jesus and Mohammed combined. 

There should be a religion started around this man. Have you heard ""Human Nature""? Go listen to it and tell me this man wasn't sent by God himself. Go watch him Moonwalk. Can Jesus do that? No. He can't. What about his anti-gravity lean. Moses may have parted the sea but Michael Jackson parted my ass cheeks because I'm officially a believer. 

I think in his prime, MJ had more followers than Jesus. He's the absolute GOAT of music. Fuck anybody who disagrees. I'd suck his dick if I got the chance, no homo. Like if you think about it, he looked attractive as both a black person and a white person. Mohammed was a child molester and consummated with Aisha when she was 9. But Michael Jackson wouldn't molest children. Corey Feldman (a guy who was molested by Harvey Weinstein and Terry Crews) said that the only person in Hollywood he ever felt safe around was Michael Jackson. 

Jesus said love the children. That's what Michael Jackson did. He built a safe haven in Neverland Ranch for kids to play at. Also, Michael Jackson fucked Elvis's daughter, Brooke Shields, and probably Madonna. So let's not forget that. He also made Thriller. Jesus didn't make Thriller. If he did, then I'd probably say that he was the greatest human being of all time. But he didn't make Thriller, so I can't. 

Moreover, Michael Jackson is the only human being in history to switch races in the middle of his career. Name the greatest black dancer in history. Name him. ""Michael Jackson"". Now name the greatest white dancer in history. Still Michael Jackson. That's just a testament to his will and his perseverance as a human being. 

If Michael Jackson wanted to, I guarantee he could have walked on water. He just never tried to, therefore we will never know. But I firmly believe he could have. If you don't think Michael Jackson was a hottie, then I question your taste in men as a whole. Thriller is the biggest selling album of all time, go look at the Black or White video and tell me he doesn't look fucking cute. If I was a homosexual (I'm not, I'm straight), but if I was a homosexual, there is no doubt in my mind that the first cock that would be in my mouth would be the King of Pop's. I firmly believe that he did not molest those children, as he was acquitted of all charges, but if he did, then I would pray to be one of those children no homo. If you made Thriller, then I would let you molest me too. 

Go watch Billie Jean at Motown and look at the way he glided across the stage. There was one black woman in the audience who you can audibly hear finger fucking herself when he did that toe stand. If you don't believe me, go search up the video and pause the video at 3:35 and tell me you don't hear that shit. I don't think I'll ever be 10x the man he was. Nobody on earth has the ability to make a woman orgasm just by moonwalking. The only person Mohamed made orgasm was Aisha, who was 6 years old when he married her, and 9 years old when they consummated. 

If you think about it, there are 1.5 billion people on earth who worship a pedophile, and then 2.5 billion people who worship a fucking nobody. Go look at Michael Jackson's super-bowl performance and then go look at his Grammy performance in 1988. It's proof that he would never touch a child sexually. You know who touches children sexually? Prophet Mohammed, who married Aisha when she was 9 years old and consummated with her when she was 6 years old.  

If you also think about it, the universe was born on January 1st. Michael Jackson's birthday is August 29th. I don't see how anyone could deny this. Michael Jackson named his child ""blanket"". To name your child after a fabric takes balls. I read a story once about how MJ was ready to square up with his brother Jermaine Jackson for dissing him. Like he was legit ready to throw hands and box. His body guard had to pull him off. Jesus didn't square up with nobody because he was a bitch. He would have got his ass knocked the fuck out if he tried. His breath probably stinks too. And the only person Mohammed squared up with was Aisha, who he would severely beat at the age of 9 for misbehaving, after he married her at the age of 6 and consummated with her at the age of 9. And also, he squared up with a lot of jews. 

I firmly believe that if Michael Jackson and Hitler sat in a room together and spoke one on one, not only would he have been able to change Hitler's mind about holocausting jewish people, but he would have also made him sexually attracted to him as well (no homo). I fully imagine Hitler making a sexual advance towards Michael Jackson, and having him politely decline the sexual advancement. And then Hitler would be heartbroken, and write a post on r/rant asking where are all the nice men in this world? 

If you think about it, I firmly believe, inspite of all of the allegations, that Michael Jackson probably had the biggest dick for a white man. If you think about it, he was born biologically a black man, but then transitioned to white man in 1987. So according to my calculations, michael jackson does indeed have the biggest white man dick of all time. I would bet a million dollars that jesus had a tiny dick. Mohammed probably had an even smaller dick as seen by his choice in women, who he would marry at the age of 6 and consummate with at the age of 9. 

So overall, in conclusion, I think that there should be a religion started around Michael Jackson (pbuh), as he was fundamentally the greatest human being of all time."

The onwy pewson Mohamed made owgasm was Aisha, who was 6 yeaws owd when he mawwied hew, and 9 yeaws owd when they consummated. 

If you think about it, thewe awe 1.5 biwwion peopwe on eawth who wowship a pedophiwe, and then 2.5 biwwion peopwe who wowship a fucking nobody. Go wook at Michaew Jackson's supew-boww pewfowmance and then go wook at his Gwammy pewfowmance in 1988. It's pwoof that he wouwd nevew touch a chiwd sexuawwy. You know who touches chiwdwen sexuawwy? Pwophet Mohammed, who mawwied Aisha when she was 9 yeaws owd and consummated with hew when she was 6 yeaws owd.  

If you awso think about it, the univewse was bown on Januawy 1st. Michaew Jackson's biwthday is August 29th. I don't see how anyone couwd deny this. Michaew Jackson named his chiwd ""bwanket"". To name youw chiwd aftew a fabwic takes bawws. I wead a stowy once about how MJ was weady to squawe up with his bwothew Jewmaine Jackson fow dissing him. Wike he was wegit weady to thwow hands and box. His body guawd had to puww him off. Jesus didn't squawe up with nobody because he was a bitch. He wouwd have got his ass knocked the fuck out if he twied. His bweath pwobabwy stinks too. And the onwy pewson Mohammed squawed up with was Aisha, who he wouwd sevewewy beat at the age of 9 fow misbehaving, aftew he mawwied hew at the age of 6 and consummated with hew at the age of 9. And awso, he squawed up with a wot of jews. 

I fiwmwy bewieve that if Michaew Jackson and Hitwew sat in a woom togethew and spoke one on one, not onwy wouwd he have been abwe to change Hitwew's mind about howocausting jewish peopwe, but he wouwd have awso made him sexuawwy attwacted to him as weww (no homo). I fuwwy imagine Hitwew making a sexuaw advance towawds Michaew Jackson, and having him powitewy decwine the sexuaw advancement. And then Hitwew wouwd be heawtbwoken, and wwite a post on w/want asking whewe awe aww the nice men in this wowwd? 

If you think about it, I fiwmwy bewieve, inspite of aww of the awwegations, that Michaew Jackson pwobabwy had the biggest dick fow a white man. If you think about it, he was bown biowogicawwy a bwack man, but then twansitioned to white man in 1987. So accowding to my cawcuwations, michaew jackson does indeed have the biggest white man dick of aww time. I wouwd bet a miwwion dowwaws that jesus had a tiny dick. Mohammed pwobabwy had an even smawwew dick as seen by his choice in women, who he wouwd mawwy at the age of 6 and consummate with at the age of 9. 

So ovewaww, in concwusion, I think that thewe shouwd be a wewigion stawted awound Michaew Jackson (pbuh), as he was fundamentawwy the gweatest human being of aww time."

840,2020-04-09 01:28:25,fxj8be,"I've been noticing an unusual trend in the quality of Snickers bars over the last decade. I found an old one from 5 years ago and decided to study its composition under my spectrometer and discovered something unnerving. The Snickers bar currently sold in stores contains 43.67% less rare earth elements by weight, when compared to one sold 5 years ago. Do they think they can fool us? It's hard to wrap my mind around why they would do this. Thorium used to make up 12% of the bar, but now it's at 8%, and now there's only 4% Americium compared to 7% just a while ago. It's all been replaced by organic carbon-based matter, like sucrose and poorly crafted carbohydrates. I'm disappointed in the Mars corporation, and I hope my findings will gain enough publicity to force Mars into reverting back to the old formula. Consider this an open letter.

876,2020-05-02 02:14:30,gbxjik,Terry Crews is one of the best dudes. He would've made one hell of a pro wrestler.
877,2020-05-02 02:43:10,gbxjik,The real OGs remember T-Money and Battledome.
878,2020-05-02 01:59:03,gbxjik,"It's not too late to bring back the T-Money character, Terry"
879,2020-05-02 01:58:08,gbxjik,We should tell him Titus have done like 5 matches in the last 3 years.
880,2020-05-02 14:04:52,gbxjik,I’m surprised he never went all the way with it honestly

889,2020-05-03 01:44:32,gbxjik,Except Terry probably would have actually been a star and world champion because he has charisma.

891,2020-05-02 02:06:08,gbxjik,"Jeffords, Scully, and Hitchcock should form a stable."
892,2020-05-02 13:56:45,gbxjik,Terry and Titus are both some of the most stand-up dudes in general
893,2020-05-02 14:16:26,gbxjik,That's T-Money to you
894,2020-05-02 05:16:05,gbxjik,"It’s funny you say that because My friends and I LOVED battledome, and I remember T bring one of my favorites. Fast forward to last year or so, someone posts the wcw/battledome crossover and my jaw about hit the floor when I realized that Terry was T-Money."
895,2020-05-02 07:20:34,gbxjik,Damn. I used to watch the shit out of Battledome (and WMAC Masters) but I didn't remember T-Money was Terry Crews. And I liked T-Money! My CAW character was named 'T-Felony' in his honor.
896,2020-05-02 08:38:49,gbxjik,"Just a coincidence that I stumbled upon a streamer I follow stream some old Battledome episodes and the guys who caught it immediately pointed out that T-Money was none other than Terry Crews himself. Dude was the best talker in the cast, for sure.

I also read later on that Battledome and WCW was gonna cross over at some point, but then the WWF/WWE Buyout happened."

MMC could happen in this time, have wrestlers swap gimmicks like they did on GLOW, have ridiculous characters like President Camacho or Ron Burgundy show up, it would keep things lively, fun and fresh."

903,2020-05-02 08:50:47,gbxjik,They actually did crossover.
904,2020-05-02 13:27:19,gbxjik,Why? He came to the public in the me2 thing that he got sexual harassed. Is it to much to assume that that may be a reason he searches for an alternative to acting?
905,2020-05-02 08:52:29,gbxjik,"Or rather, it was going places or something. Our TV/Cable coverage only really had WCW but not Battledome, and sometimes we'd be months behind too lol"
906,2020-05-02 14:43:16,gbxjik,That happened years after he'd already been in both movies and TV shows.  He wasn't about to start wrestling training at 44.
907,2020-05-02 13:58:09,gbxjik,"I thought the sexual harassment was a Hollywood thing, not something he experienced in the wrestling world."
908,2020-05-02 14:35:17,gbxjik,Thats why I said he may searched for other stuff than acting and thought wrestling may be a good alternative.

910,2020-05-02 22:45:08,gbxjik,It was very loosely worded.

969,2020-04-28 21:13:59,g9to82,Fair enough. That's the worry so I'll be on the lookout for the most comprehensive guide.
970,2020-04-28 18:10:00,g9s23a,"I've always thought Mary Elizabeth Winstead would be an awesome Ripley. She looks similar to Sigourney Weaver, and I think she is capable of delivering a proper performance given the proper direction."
971,2020-04-28 18:12:03,g9s23a,An Alien remake would be as criminal as a Jaws remake.
972,2020-04-28 18:23:32,g9s23a,"Emily Blunt is Ripley and that’s final.

Seriously she’s already been in as close to an adaptation of Aliens: Volume One as we’ll ever get: *Edge of Tomorrow: Live Die Repeat*."

974,2020-04-28 18:09:33,g9s23a,No.
975,2020-04-28 22:04:37,g9s23a,"What about hmmm... Mary Elizabeth Winstead for Ripley as the guy down has saided?  Reese Witherspoon for Lambert. Eli Roth for Kane, (Or Jake Gyllenhaal), Brian Cox for Dallas... I can't imagine some for Ash and Brett :/"

   Ben Stiller as Hicks?

979,2020-04-29 03:08:21,g9s23a,My exact thoughts. I would actually publicly protest against a JAWS remake lol
980,2020-04-28 18:48:44,g9s23a,Interesting- I still remember her in _The Devil Wears Prada_ role most; I'll have to rewatch EOT again.

983,2020-04-29 03:38:16,g9s23a,I certainly wouldn't support it.  There's no way to beat the original so just don't try.  Thankfully this seems to be the general attitude about it because I've not heard about anyone considering remakes of either beyond fan what-ifs.
984,2020-04-28 19:20:01,g9s23a,I'd also recommend *A Quiet Place*.

I agree that we don't finish building. But my reaction to reading it was that, ya I do feel in pieces right now like everything doesn't feel right during this coronavirus time. But I think we all know that feeling when we feel ""whole"" and all is well, we are happy and living our best life (this is probably a privilege though). It is good to work towards that feeling and maintain it. I think also it is good to let curiosity and excitement drive the ship forward, but you also have to have the crew (ahem) if you will, keeping the ship in shape."

Of recent I'm very much deciding to take the steps that push me in the way of things I want to do but also just finding a new disregard for things I use to do also. Like a found strictness for what I eat, what I drink, how I respond, when you express more confidence and a myriad of other outputs. It's not a sense of bossing yourself but mastering the exact path you want and negating the rest. Sure these are trying times but they've given me the right isolation to resolve the past self that doesn't correlate with the version 2.0 that I'm now killing it with.

I guess to sum it up is that I feel that my comfort zone is slowly enlarging and mastering each step out of it makes me my favourite boss.

1101,2020-04-24 21:40:12,g7ep2k,"Watched this with my 5 year old daughter yesterday. Although my wife and I had reservations about the plot involving children trying to ""orphan"" themselves, the film handled the subject in a family friendly manner. My kids birthday is around Halloween so she loves things like Nightmare before Xmas, Coraline and anything else thats dark or creepy. We have watched the Series of Unfortunate Events series a few times through and are reading the books currently. I'm all for more complex thought provoking content for children. Don't get me wrong, if given the choice between this movie and Trolls World Tour for the millionth time. Shell choose Trolls all day, but between this film and Klaus, Netflix seems to be stepping up their game when it comes to entertainment that the whole family can enjoy together."
1102,2020-04-24 21:38:17,g7ep2k,"This film essentially felt like one of Wes Anderson’s animated films mixed with something Phil Lord and Chris Miller would make, with a satisfying dash of 1940s cartoon slapstick for good measure. That is to say, it was a way better film than I thought it would be. 

Also Ricky Gervais’ character was hilarious. Pretty sure he improvised at least 40% of his lines.

I should also mention that the scene where the kids are forced to embrace their deaths atop a snowy peak was shockingly heart-wrenching for a PG-rated animated movie. I didn’t think they’d have the guts to go there in a modern animated kids film but I’m really impressed that they did."
1103,2020-04-25 01:38:34,g7ep2k,"Watched on a whim and was pleasantly surprised. Really enjoyable and a funny twist on what would otherwise be a pretty dark premise. The cast was also very good, especially Alesia Cara who surprised me with her voice acting. Anyway, I laughed a ton so I would highly recommend this!"
1104,2020-04-24 23:36:27,g7ep2k,Wow that was surprisingly good
1105,2020-05-01 07:07:58,g7ep2k,"Spoilers.

Here's a creepy thing I noticed:

BOTH parents have no understanding of tech, at all. Both parents are redhaired, just like all the Willoughbys. Neither seem to have any extended family. As soon as the orphaned baby is seen by the mother she disdainfully says that it isn't a Willoughby, though she doesn't seem to know that she hasn't given birth. 

I came to the conclusion that the parents might have been raised in the same household. That maybe they were BOTH Willoughbys before they were married, which is why they were both isolated and unaware of tech. My theory is that they are related. Like brother and sister related..."
1106,2020-04-25 01:20:31,g7ep2k,"I enjoyed this movie so much. My favorite has been Meet the Robinsons for so long, but this is equally as good if not better. Enchanting through and through."
1107,2020-04-27 08:21:10,g7ep2k,"I randomly watched this at 4 a.m. and I loved it, reminded me of Meet the Robinsons. It's a little different from most movies, but it was charming. I almost cried at the end when I thought they died! I think the cat was my favorite character, haha"
1108,2020-04-27 01:04:29,g7ep2k,"What a charming movie! The 3D/Stop Motion feel they went for worked beautifully. I never read the book it’s based on, but I liked the balance of dark and sweet they managed to hit with this. They even payed of what I wanted the whole movie and killed off the parents. Seriously they were fucking horrible there was only one satisfying conclusion."
1109,2020-05-09 08:03:07,g7ep2k,"I loved the movie, but I think that the end is a little bit...eh...unrealistic.

I mean, yeah, it was a happy ending, everyone with smiles in their faces and blah blah blah, but the movie is basically saying: If your parents are abusing you, welp dude is your problem, wait until you can find another family.

That movie made me afraid of the ""social services"", and their actions. It's just not a good example that can be given to a innocent kid that does not understand how a ""normal"" family should behave.
I don't know, but the -social services- being the ""evil"" was way too much. It was gross for me, imagine for a little kid."
1110,2020-05-12 02:43:38,g7ep2k,"I have this theory that they died in the end that's why it was the only part that was unrealistic. That's why Jane said ""One last what if"" because she was thinking and imagining what would have happened if they stayed alive. Hence in the song ""There's no need for goodbyes now I'm seeing the light"". Also at the beginning of the story, it said that it was a tragic story."
1111,2020-04-30 07:25:51,g7ep2k,"I absolutely loved it, I feel that it shows kids a family friendly way of emotional abuse and physical abuse.

We need to show kids more of this so they can understand it more and know the signs and I personally feel this did a great job in showing that.

Not everyone’s cup of tea but I thought it was great"
1112,2020-05-15 02:47:41,g7ep2k,"The most redeeming part of the movie is the animation itself, but otherwise the characters were not my cup of tea, the plot was trying way too hard to justify itself, and I feel the handling if it’s messages was problematic for a movie that features child abuse. 

The main characters were unlikable in my opinion, which I feel was intentional on the part of the writers because they wanted to show how abused children don’t need to be perfect to deserve to be saved from their situation or to be shown love, kindness, and patience, but that they didn’t know how to actually implement this. 


The older brother for example is clearly trying to be responsible and watch out for his siblings while struggling with the brunt of their family’s abuse, and it feels like the movie doesn’t acknowledge that enough because they instead wanted to focus on how Jane was the writer’s favorite. (Which I’m convinced she only was because she could be used for the award-bait song.)

It would have made more sense actually if Jane had been the one who made the mistake of trying to get rid of the Nanny because it fits her character more for her to selfishly want to do whatever she wants without listening to an authority figure. That was her whole gripe with Tim even though he was trying to make their lives better. It would have been a more interesting character arc than just making her out to be the embodiment of ‘hope’ who is always right or whatever. Tim instead is reduced to the over controlling buttmonkey that the narrative treats badly because he isn’t perfect.

Meanwhile Jane got away with being a dangerously selfish person, such as taking ALL the food for herself when their parents aren’t feeding them, despite knowing she had *two much younger brothers* who were starving just as much as she was, or letting her brother be the scapegoat for everything when she causes trouble. 

The problem is that she didn’t have any real redeeming qualities because her whole character is about her being the embodiment of hope, but they don’t even show this to the audience; instead her behaviors are just random. We’re never show her just being hopeful about having a happy loving family for herself, just singing and putting everyone in danger while the narrative bends itself into a pretzel trying to make her the big good. She is only called out for being selfish in one scene, only for letting Tim be the scapegoat but never for hogging all the food so her siblings could starve, but they try to equate her selfishness with Tim’s controlling and tendencies, when her selfishness was ten times more harmful to others than Tim’s actually was. 

Also, it doesn’t even make sense for Tim to not know how to get real food instead of trying to feed his family a fake lobster. That plot point is completely contrived. It doesn’t make sense for him to make GOOD food, but at the very least to know how to get bread and cheese. Come on!

The twins are also called creepy several times without actually being that bad, but I feel this was the writers trying to get away with no actually giving them a personality besides being inventors. Which also doesn’t make sense because they were the ones who carried the whole plot and got things done. They should have been the main characters *long* before Jane. 

Linda the nanny was... alright, but the movie was also trying to make her out to be the perfect mother figure for the kids but was doing so in the most short handed of ways versus really doubling down on her love for the children. For example they did it by using oats as shorthand for her caring for them as if that fixes all problems when really the kids needed therapy and someone who could listen and make them feel safe. Instead the movie focused on her being hyper and quirky. 
So all in all I didn’t find the characters likable at all, and this makes the movie feel less enjoyable and more like an outrage.

But the plot of the movie is also very jumbled in a way that I think means the writers were so much more attached to the idea of making an adventure film while also trying to attach a message about family to the end of it than actually making a good movie with a good message. 

I have seen other movies on Netflix that HAVE been able to handle the theme of family with a lot more heart while also being interesting. This one I think they just had the idea of what scenes they wanted to make, but they didn’t focus as much attention in the development of the family themes in a way that could be taken as seriously. 

The parents for example are odious to the point that you *do* want to see them die, but I actually chalk that up more to their weirdness like when the husband keeps... purring... it felt gross. But they are treated by the film as just so ridiculous and are given just a tad too much focus that the film doesn’t give the abuse the children suffer enough gravitas. 

If the film had spent more time displaying the effects of starvation, and neglect, and emotional abuse than just one *gag* about being hungry, one scene of the girl looking sad while it rains, and Tim just hanging out on the coal pile, then the direness of their situation would have strengthened their stance and made up actually feel something for them. And they also didn’t display how the children’s relationship to each other is important either. 

We are shown the kids squabbling and betraying each other so often that you almost feel as if they would have been *better off* having separate families that could give them each the love and care they deserved without being toxic to one another. One message this movie didn’t do well is that for your own health and well-being you do not have to put up with toxic and harmful people. They tried with sending the parents away, but then they tried to make it seem like being all together with them would be better than being with other families that were all clearly loving and providing for them. 

The kids don’t work together and instead are dangerously selfish to the point they resemble their parents. Like the above point of Jane taking all the food for herself while everyone else starves. But somehow we’re supposed to be rooting for them to stay together? If there had been a scene of the siblings sharing what little they have and being a support for each other then the concept of them needing to stay together would have been more believable and would have helped make the plot make more sense. 

For example if they showed the coal basement as a more fearsome environment, or showed the kids sadder about being starved, this would have hammered home the need for the kids to get the hell out of there.
Instead it suffers from the same kind of problems that books like Harry Potter or Matilda suffered from when they play off an abusive family as funny. 

And finally I think the handling of child protective services is a horrible message to make for children when the core theme is of a bunch of kids escaping their abusive parents! Child protective services are there to actually get children out of horrible situations in real life. One of the first things that abusive parents use against their kids is telling them that the mean of CPS will take them away and making them out to be bad so that the parent can continue to harm them. So it is horrible to paint them as evil when the reality is that some kids are taught not to seek help when they need it and this kind of movie actually highlights that message. 

They also have a horrible message about families in general when they keep on trying to act as if adopted families aren’t ‘real’ families: Tim goes to several good families with prospective parents who were willing to love and care for him, and the movie really dismisses all the adoptive parents and treats the issue as if they aren’t important because they aren’t the children’s ‘real’ family, and that is a horrible message.

So those were my problems with the film. The only redeeming quality is the plot about Ruth finding a good home, but honestly if the movie had been about filling her journey it would have been a much better film. Even if it was just a movie about the Colonel learning about how to raise and care for a child, that is a much more compelling film than what we got. And it’s not because she is a baby; if it was a film about how growing up to become a troubled child in any way even then that would have been a better story. 

So yeah, I watched it for the animation, but that’s really about it."
1113,2020-05-03 07:56:27,g7ep2k,Just wanted to say I watched this movie while I was tripping on acid and this shit was AMAZING
1114,2020-04-29 00:50:21,g7ep2k,9/10
1115,2020-04-25 03:10:38,g7ep2k,The Nanny Capult going off into the streets could have been the best joke of the year
1116,2020-04-25 07:49:36,g7ep2k,Not bad. Not great. Catchy tune.
1117,2020-05-01 01:23:03,g7ep2k,Ricky Gervais as a cat is honestly too perfect.
1118,2020-04-24 21:52:50,g7ep2k,Reading these reviews makes me feel like I'm one of only few people that absolutely hated this film. I like the artstyle but that's where my good review ends. This film is a jumbled together mess of shallow characters and random storylines. I may not be the demographic but I think I can recognize a good story for young audiences when I see one and this is NOT one of those. 2/10
1119,2020-05-25 17:40:44,g7ep2k,"I have a theory that Tim actually died of starvation at the beginning, in the basement, and the cat was him going over his life and making up the perfect life he wanted."
1120,2020-05-18 21:14:04,g7ep2k,"Isn't this movie is too much, too fast, too cocaine?

Feels like someone ate 2 kilos of sour Skittles with couple litres of red bull"
1121,2020-06-01 22:12:20,g7ep2k,I hate the message this film sent on child protective services I think it just confuses children and even how they depicted orphans it just left a bad taste on my mouth. I also found myself to hate Janes character and feel sorry for Tim having to be the one to deal with her. Throughout the beginning of the movie Jane got Tim in trouble for almost everything and he was blamed for things she did and never did she have to take punishment for her actions and even after all that Tim never once got mad of her after the fact but when Tim does what he felt was right by calling the “orphan services” Jane gets mad at him and makes him feel guilty. Then she wants him to apologize to her and he finally confronts her on her own actions and she just brushes it off. I just hate how this film sends so many bad messages to kids and Can just lead to confusion but I see they did try to deal with heavy topics to children but I felt it was all done in the wrong way. Did anybody else have a problem with those messages or was it just me??
1122,2020-05-12 03:00:32,g7ep2k,"By the way! There is an after credits scene! It's Gervais' kitty, and it's quite funny, haha"
1123,2020-06-17 21:08:44,g7ep2k,"the nanny's got an adorable design, she's the best part of movie"
1124,2020-04-29 00:09:16,g7ep2k,"I love computer animated films and I'm in my 30s... But this was terrible!! It would have been funnier if they would have tried ""orphaning"" themselves by implementing some of the weapons installed for the house hunters on their parents instead! The mom & dad were just disturbing to watch and the moustache-hair knitting was not nearly as funny as it could have been. Nanny was obnoxiously loud and I didn't find the Barnabys creepy in the least (but that baby WAS a straight up alien)! 
Nearly everything the movie claimed about itself turned out to be the complete opposite! It had a happy ending, although Gervais's perpetually oh-so-sarcastic voice had introduced [much in a Lemony Snicket-style] the fact that it wouldn't! The Barnabys weren't creepy; the kids were supposed to be smart, but couldn't cook their own food?? Somehow the fascist child orphan service allowed them to be adopted by Nanny and Willy Wonka-ripoff-dude (without ever knowing whether their parents actually died in the Alps-they didn't by the way, until the very end when they were eaten by sharks)."
1125,2020-06-14 01:24:01,g7ep2k,Watched this with my little brother earlier today. It was actually really charming and also that scene with the kids hugging each other while freezing was heart wrenching.

1127,2020-04-26 09:21:41,g7ep2k,Why does this movie have a 92% on RT? That should imply excellence. The animation was pleasing but aside from that it was a bunch of jumbled storylines that didn’t flow together. The main character was ironically as unlikeable as his parents and I didn’t understand the emphasis on mustaches. I’m not familiar with the source material but this was very underwhelming

They used the animation to their advantage in this one for visual storytelling and scene setting for sure. One part that stands out to me is when they chase Ruth down in the Melanoff factory, and the routes of all the candy machines. All the colours, all the shapes... great stuff."
1131,2020-05-01 17:18:05,g7ep2k,Klaus was FANTASTIC. My girlfriend and I cried at the beautiful ending. Can’t recommend that movie enough!
1132,2020-05-03 22:30:58,g7ep2k,"My 8 year old absolutely loves those movies, shes seen Coraline about 100 times but she didnt like this one."
1133,2020-04-25 22:57:12,g7ep2k,"Agreed, the four of them accepting death and holding each other made me think of toy story 3 straight away. And I mean that in a good way."
1134,2020-04-25 08:56:30,g7ep2k,"I agree on Alessia Cara's voice acting, I had no idea it was her. And singing voice was a little different but still really good!"
1135,2020-05-03 19:13:33,g7ep2k,"I thought this too...the parents also look waaaay too similar for it to be a coincidence lol

If true, it's just really down right messed up with the theme of family in this movie..."
1136,2020-07-19 23:57:50,g7ep2k,"The whole family. Even the ancestors. ""Everyone had mustaches, even the women"" they were the only red heads pretty much in the whole movie and each of them had the same body type. I noticed this early.and Jane and Tim acted more like husband and wife then brother and sister."
1137,2020-06-24 19:20:19,g7ep2k,The end is unrealistic because they died at top of the mountain cold.
1138,2020-07-08 19:04:23,g7ep2k,As someone taken from child services and my brother and sister. I would say they got it right they kinda are evil well what i went through made me not trust them. I am back with my real family after 16 months though it was 13 years ago.
1139,2020-05-24 09:18:29,g7ep2k,I’ll add onto this by saying the award bait song would have been more impactful if Jane didn’t sing the damn tune to it every 10-15 minutes in the movie. Like they really trying to make me feel with this?! She sang this tune while chewing on bus seat gum!
1140,2020-05-03 22:24:45,g7ep2k,"Was stoned, can confirm. I told my bf that I want whatever drugs the creators were on."

1142,2020-04-29 04:20:37,g7ep2k,"8/10 for animation. 

2/10 for story. 

My wife and I watch all the animated films and had to turn this shitshow off after 30 minutes."
1143,2020-04-29 04:15:51,g7ep2k,It’s a mess. I googled to see if it was written by artificial intelligence as some kind of weird experiment.
1144,2020-04-28 02:34:54,g7ep2k,Agreed man. The plot was a wash over. The animation sugarcoated the horrendous plot. So linear. Could have predicted the whole movie from the first five minutes. This is all taking into consideration that its made for kids. Has anyone in this thread seen a Pixar movie? That is how you create an engaging plot for this audience. My little sister is 9 and this was boring.
1145,2020-04-25 03:02:00,g7ep2k,"I hated it too. I found it hard to connect with Tim, the main character. And Melanoff and the baby were just plot devices to be picked up and dropped to move the plot along

I saw the movie's potential in the trailer. But the best viewing experience, is just to watch that and not the entire movie. 

I regretted watching this film, it was unpleasant for me. I had to watch another movie to erase it from my mind."
1146,2020-04-25 03:29:41,g7ep2k,"Exactly! Jesus Christ I hated this movie so, so much. I'm doing a movie marathon this quarantine season and even through all those films this is among the worst movies I've watched in my life. I just... don't get why people are having such good reception to this piece of shit. Ah well, people have their opinions, but not only are the characters so annoying they're also stupid as fuck. Was rooting for them to die at the Alps to be honest.

Only bright spot of light was the Nanny and the Commander I guess, though the latter much less so.

Rant over, just had to say my piece."
1147,2020-06-10 22:09:31,g7ep2k,I'm watching this shit right now and I can't believe this is a 2020 movie. I hate how it portrays orphans and orphan services.
1148,2020-05-03 20:51:44,g7ep2k,I pretty sure that happy ending was a dream or their afterlife. They would have been blue like their parents if they were really saved. My theory is the children died on the alps.
1149,2020-04-29 04:21:19,g7ep2k,You’re not wrong.
1150,2020-04-24 21:06:31,g7ep2k,It’s not unusual for animated films to have multiple directors
1151,2020-04-27 01:07:40,g7ep2k,"It shouldn't? Rotten tomatoes is an aggregate site, it doesn't mean that in average it received a score of 92% from people. It means that 92% of all people that saw it enjoyed it, in other words gave it a rating if 6 or higher. Metacritics average score is 68, so 92% of people probably gave it a 6 or a 7. Using rotten tomatoes or any aggregate site as a measure of ""excellence"" is ridiculous, there's plenty good films that will have polarizing reviews and since aggregate sites are apparently so hard to understand for most people, they'll simply ignore it"
1152,2020-04-26 20:20:21,g7ep2k,Well the movie was based on a children’s book so that could explain some of it
1153,2020-04-29 04:19:03,g7ep2k,Rotten tomatoes is a bad system. Metacritic gives a more accurate idea of critical consensus.  This one had a 64/100 which is still way too high considering the story is shit but the animation was quality.

1156,2020-05-24 16:04:29,g7ep2k,"Exactly! I think that it highlights the fact that they were trying to come up with a contrived justification for having her sing it in the first place, with a “See! She sings it all the time, it’s part of her personality!” But also was just a reminder to give them an award for using it, lol!"
1157,2020-05-02 19:09:49,g7ep2k,"The whole time I watched it I was thinking it felt like it was being discovery written and then never curated after the first draft. It was a beautiful movie, but also a meandering mess."

Bring Jameela Jamil into the cast as a British policing expert to consult with the 99, especially in the field of unarmed policing."
1187,2020-06-26 12:03:50,hfxto6,Next season will be a big flop I called it ...

1191,2020-06-26 03:07:24,hfxto6,I would assume because they would like to use their platform to talk about issues like police brutality and the extrajudicial killing of people of color.

1193,2020-06-25 16:05:52,hfn8h9,I like that but we've got to remember he also talks about how you can act out with your partner. Sex performed together with love and understanding (i would also submit commitment but i understand its different for everyone) is medicine. We can still damage those we have sex with because we treat them like objects just how we look at pornstars as objects. Ay im on day 4 too bro lets get it!
1194,2020-06-25 17:10:58,hfn8h9,Terry Crews is a legend. Let’s strive to rid us of this addiction.

I clearly know what to do (stop doing that Ofcourse) but it just sorta out of boredom I guess?"

1207,2020-06-26 04:09:38,hfn8h9,"i read somewhere that sex is one of the most powerful energy and now i can relate 
yes it's  true i guess because when sex is between two people who actually love each other then it releases the energy of transformation.
a couple exchange energy when they do (as it does contain a soul in it that's why a person is born isn't it)
and then it is called ""love making"" as for love(energy) and making(creation)

but when you have an urge just by watching porn 
it's ""JUST"" sex - like on bodily level 
and as the drug takes over you the same energy which is for love and transformation turnes into the force of rape and destruction.

NoFap will lead to you having one of the most profound emotional and romantic experiences of your life when you do have sex with the right person. Good luck bro!"

To those asking what about this sub is blue pilled: people getting on their knees for woman putting them on a pedestal, not having a spine and standing up for yourself. 

This is supposed to be a self improvement sub. Stop putting woman on a  pedestal. The goal is for you to get better and grow as a person."

1382,2020-06-26 03:19:05,hfn8h9,"Well, if I had to explain. 
The only two things I did was:

Cut porn 100 percent out of my life. 
(I mean it. Dont look it up, don't follow people, subreddits. Discord, saved images. All of it)

The first week and a half is going to be the hardest time of your life.  

The second thing I did was find something therapeutic or calming to do for fun. Personally I play Stardew Valley and listen to calming music. 

Find whatever that thing is for you. Stick with it and stay calm. 

This is the #1 rule for me. Because it's way easier dealing with porn addiction if you're calm."

Thanks man! I hope you are or will be in one too."
1384,2020-06-25 17:13:59,hfn8h9,Because by keeping nutrition and sexual energy by transmuting it instead of non-reproductve sex we don’t get weak. Mature semen or feminine hormones might be more powerful.

1388,2020-06-25 19:25:37,hfn8h9,This is not a sub-wide issue. Most people here agree with you. I see comments and posts all the time reminding others not to take this path for the sake of women attraction. At this point it's a given for nofap. The exception is younger teens who have limited experience with women to begin with. They get a pass in my book.

1397,2020-06-25 19:36:23,hfn8h9,I've come to the cliff of inceldom twice in my life because I thought I deserved sex and wasn't getting it. It took a hard reality check from a trusted friend to show me otherwise. I'm so grateful to him for showing me just how wrong and misogynistic I was being.
1398,2020-06-25 17:45:15,hfn8h9,"I get it man, like I think it's a kinda extreme point of view of yours, I think sexual energy must be set to the right direction of course. instead of watching porn or masturbating, the individual should spend it with a lover ou a partner, but not like waiting for the marriage or something, the man or woman should find his or her partner and try to pass them that energy and enjoy it, waiting for marriage is a pointless choice on my way of thinking, 'cause I'm a atheist. 

I really like to have some conversations like these one, I'm loving this subreddit btw"
1399,2020-06-25 23:30:14,hfn8h9,No you’re right man which is why I’m super open minded about it. The most important thing is everyone here is here to combat this disgusting addiction. We all share this common goal. Our job is to go farther than that an teach the youth that life is more than getting woman. It’s about finding our purpose whether we are men or woman and striving to be better than yesterday. Thanks for you input friend.
1400,2020-06-25 17:27:16,hfn8h9,What about this post is blue pill?
1401,2020-06-25 20:27:36,hfn8h9,See thats something im still debating because ive found kinks like that come from emotional deficiencies within myself. In the proper context might they enjoy that? Yeah and that could be part of sex with your partner. If its communicated and done with care and not selfishness.
1402,2020-06-25 21:50:21,hfn8h9,"No my friend, i found out that kinks come from emotional deficiencies. My kink is my wife calling me papi during sex. It probably means i have been raped by my dad as a child."

1404,2020-06-25 19:53:18,hfn8h9,"Considering that most people on earth actually do ""have"" sex then yeah - you might feel that you deserve it. It's one of the basic human needs, even though it is not as necessary as your need to eat but still - lack of sex may lead to mental health issues, thus many people escape towards porn or masturbating to release their tension."
1405,2020-06-25 23:21:59,hfn8h9,"That's why sex exists,to be done. Just saying"
1406,2020-06-25 17:46:26,hfn8h9,"The extreme romanticization of sex, this sub is supposed to be about getting rid of porn addiction and masturbation, not about proselityzing christian-like values. 

Sex is just sex, all this ""love and understanding in sex"" is off putting for most modern women anyway."

You’re putting sex on a pedi stool tho, focus on your self and don’t focus on just having sex so much. Things fall into place magically when you don’t worry about them. I can’t tell you how empty I’ve gotten after sex in past relationships, it makes you feel empty. It feels good for a small moment, then nothing. I think sex can only be good when you truly love someone, focus on yourself and you’ll find the one."

1413,2020-06-25 19:04:55,hfn8h9,"Treating people who you have sex with like people is not a ""Christian-like"" value. All he is saying is that, seeing the person you're hooking up just as a means to an orgasm is as bad, if not worse, than masturbation and pornography. I wouldn't like to have sex with someone I never shared a word with, and I wouldn't like to be treated like a sex object by someone, and neither do most people in normal human-human relationship's."
1414,2020-06-25 17:54:06,hfn8h9,"I could respond point by point but that would be futile go listen to the podcast where terry crews says that quote:

I understand how it would be frustrating for you to have things you dont agree with mixed into this sub. Truth is a lot of members on here probably are christian. Im not trying to spread anything that i havent found to be true. After being objectives and objectifying ive found only sexual relationships based on communication and the aforementioned aspects can bring that healing quality. You may have found different and i respect and honor that but i wont censor what ive found to be true."
1415,2020-06-25 18:40:06,hfn8h9,The sex talked about in this sub isn’t Christian. Christian sex is between a man and woman in marriage.
1416,2020-06-25 18:11:33,hfn8h9,Yeah so why would you succumb to what modern women think they want? That's the only blue pill shit around here.
1417,2020-06-25 19:42:32,hfn8h9,"What’s the point of giving up masturbation then? If “sex is just sex” and nothing more, where are the negative effects of porn showing themselves?"
1418,2020-06-25 20:30:27,hfn8h9,Not trying man. You can straw man what I'm saying like that but i legit think those things.
1419,2020-06-26 00:33:33,hfn8h9,"I think what a lot of people find difficult is some guys masturbate and watch porn all the time and have a different attitude to most people in this sub about how to treat and talk to girls, and yet they get girls easy. We have a different attitude and can’t get girls and try and do nofap as a way of changing those odds. It’s such a difficult thing to explain but I hope you get my point."

1424,2020-06-25 19:22:30,hfn8h9,What he meant is that. He just didn't know how to put it in the right way. I think. I used to struggle in the same way
1425,2020-06-25 18:22:37,hfn8h9,Except you're oblivious to the fact that female nature is pliable and adaptable to that of a stronger males.

I care about what it's true and what benefits me the most, most guys here want the romantic fantasy because they been brainwashed by society, not because they really want that."
1432,2020-06-25 19:26:12,hfn8h9,"How f*ed up are you? YES of course people who are people want some things in common, we all share things with each other. We all don't want to feel sad. We all want to be satisfied with our lives. We all want a community where we feel understood. Must of us want fullfiling emotional and sexual lives. But how we get there is different for everyone, and that's not something you can chance about someone, independently of how *alpha* you are. I mean, you can pretend to be someone you are not, but that doesn't work very well"

     And your whole point is made around constructed bullshit, which I also don't enjoy, but there isn't anything biological about kinks and sexual preference's. That's about as constructed as the ""romance fantasies"", and that doesn't make it bad or wrong or dishonest either, it's just one more thing for people to enjoy. 
     And you can't possibly think OP was talking about kinks when he said that, he's talking about a chauvinistic societal problems perpetuated by pornography, not lovingly choking your one night stand, yes, that was a joke. 
    Honestly to me you sound like a very confused and hurt person. Filled with many more certainties then questions. Lashing out on other people's behaviors or ideias that don't even disagree with your own, just because they remind you of a blissful ignorance and innocense you feel the world has taken from you.

1437,2020-06-25 18:28:57,hfmhrf,"i love B99 and will watch every episode over and over again. but something i have come to terms with is how it portrays bad policing as comedy or “what it takes to get the job done”. the first moment i noticed this was actually in one of the very first episodes where Terry is on edge and unloads his gun into a mannequin. i think this show has so many good merits, but i would be remiss as a fan to not point out how this could shape how civilians see/interact with LEOs. 


obviously it’s “just a tv show” and “it’s all fiction”, but i think fiction can absolutely influence how people live their lives and view the world around them. idk. just my two cents. 



again, i’m not attacking any actors, producers, writers, or anyone involved in B99. i love the show. but it’s because i love it so much i wish it would acknowledge the shortcomings of portraying police officers and detective in a certain way."

1439,2020-06-26 09:40:01,hfmhrf,A counter-point is that Terry's on desk duty because of the mannequin incident and as a character he is very reluctant to go back out in the field for fear of losing control in a similar way.
1440,2020-06-25 19:21:36,hfmhrf,"you can still enjoy the show and the characters but still recognize that’s copoganda. in fact, that’s a very mature and intelligent thing to do!"
1441,2020-06-26 05:52:45,hfmhrf,What’s interesting is that many LEO’s (Law Enforcement Officers) have actually states that the show is very realistic in how it portrays police/detective work

1457,2020-06-25 05:34:20,hf664z,"The SJW thinks of people needing to have all the same exact opinions they possess, don't feel as if you need to do the same if we are to live in a world any different free of them. No one unplugs over night and on this issue he's clearly right and he's in the position of being one of the few people some of them will actually listen too. 

A white person saying this would instantly get deleted from existence. If there is a peaceful solution it's going to have to be from brave black people that are willing to say the truth: that BLM is racially divisive, it is violent, and it is filled with people who are black supremacists that just want to see white people suffer rather than actually have equality."
1458,2020-06-24 20:56:06,hf664z,"I stand corrected, but it is still hosted and popularized here in Canada. Either way, it's still good that they had Terry Crews giving a platform to speak up than being silenced."

1460,2020-06-24 18:03:24,hf46ju,"if the show doesn't address this then it would be outrageously out of touch.  B99 has never been afraid to tackle real issues, and if it were to ignore this one it would be a very bad look."
1461,2020-06-24 17:28:48,hf46ju,"There's nothing political about cops killing black people, or a show about cops (that has tackled real life issues in the past) addressing this."

1466,2020-06-24 18:13:20,hf46ju,"This isn't just a random show about a completely unrelated thing though.  B99 is a cop show with two black leads that has had an episode in which racial profiling against African-Americans was the main focus.  I don't see how B99 can avoid acknowledging the current social climate now that it's shown multiple times that it will dedicate time to addressing these social issues.

If some fans stop watching B99 because it's addressing a very pertinent issue with direct ties to its subject matter and cast then that's on those fans, not on the show for addressing it.  This is absolutely the right call and I'm glad to see something of the sort said publicly."

---

Jake is involved in an standoff. Acting out his desire to live through Die Hard Jake shoots and kills someone who turns out to have not been armed.

The detective squad is divided with Boyle sycophantically standing by Jake and Captain Holt unwaveringly confident in the good of the NYPD and the systems it represents, but the rest, including even Amy, are varying degrees of doubtful. As this happens focus shifts away from Jake as more scenes are shown from the perspective of these characters.


Outcries against the shooting arise with investigations being called for. Holt orders a stonewalling of journalists but Diaz, in her typical chaotic good way, leaks information. Pressures from the department rise to find the source of the leaks. Jake, having now been largely ostracized by much of the detective squad, has fallen in with the *worst* type of uniformed cop and this clique leads the charge in attempting to harass and punish anyone they believe responsible for the leak.

I'm not really sure where or how this would end. Are the good members driven out, with the ""good"" cast members spending the last episode working at a post office? Do protesters burn the 99th precinct to the ground?"

I hated cops, but I do remember a Simpsons(?) episode that parodied cops and showed a cop planting evidence. Learned from that."
1521,2020-06-24 12:19:57,herkfg,[deleted]
1522,2020-06-24 04:06:09,herkfg,"Yeah. Because until now I could accept the premise of the show, which is that every cop in New York except for the detective squad of Brooklyn's 99th Precinct is a piece of shit. That is the concept of the show, there's been maybe two or three other cops introduced who weren't corrupt or inept. In case it wasn't clear in the subtext Holt even states at one point that the Nine Nine is at war with the NYPD. I mean that's not exactly subtle.

All that being said though, even that premise, that there is one squad of cops in New York who aren't bastards, I don't think that can still stand.

&#x200B;

And I think that to be dismissive of 'recent weeks' is to miss the magnitude of this moment in history. June 2020 is already the most significant month in the history of policing in the United States, possibly ever. The USA saw major peaceful protests in every major city in every state, and the police in nearly every city responded with unapologetic brutality and relentless violence. Their response across the nation was, ""We see you, we hear you, but we're going to bet we can beat you into silence.""

And it hasn't worked. And it still isn't working. And the tear gas stockpiles are emptying. And the cops are strung out and tired and quitting in droves. And charges are getting filed and lawsuits are being made. And the protests aren't stopping and this isn't going away.

And so, yeah. What we've seen in 'recent weeks' matters. It changes everything, and it's not done changing things.

&#x200B;

Not saying all that to dismiss what you're saying either. I know what you mean. ACAB was true six months ago. ACAB was true a hundred years ago. I just think that it's really important that we see the scale of the events unfolding around us."
1523,2020-06-24 05:29:57,herkfg,"As an until-recent Brooklyn resident, I could never really palette it. Even with multiple friends watching. But I suppose I know first hand what NYPD is really like."
1524,2020-06-24 04:24:17,herkfg,"If they were genuinely rethinking their plans they wouldn't have done this move in response to the whole ""cops bad' shit going on right now. If the creative team gave a shit, B99 would be politically charged from day one. Mention the trans, disabled, poor, black, or any other minority suffering from police violence in every episode. But no, it's a friggin comedy show. That occasionally touches on important topics, yes, but to delay production in a move to satisfy people that will move on a few months from now to the next outrageous thing is pointless."
1525,2020-06-24 04:19:32,herkfg,"I'm not whining lmao, I genuinely don't care. I just find it funny that people who break from the hivemind once in a while are instantly targeted. And yes, my comment did contribute to the conversation through the implication that I thought the creators of B99 pretending to be WoKe (despite the outrage machine moving on to the next controversy in a month or two) was ridiculous and simply delaying the release of a fuckin *comedy* show was purely virtue-signalling. 

But because I didn't say ""all cops r bad hurrdurr"" like the good little bitch I should be, I'm the bad person here. Seriously, you people make all of us social justice advocates look petty and really quite sad.

Edit: Like I said, Idc about digital ego-stroking points, but I gotta say, I think having three separate downvote-bombed comments with the amount they do is kinda impressive ngl"

The industry has been shut down due to the coronavirus so maybe the writers decided to take the extra downtime from filming to come up with something better and relevant to current events. From what I've read, it doesn't seem uncommon for TV show writers to be spending extra time polishing scripts since that's a job that can be safely done from home, unlike filming."

It’s fine if you don’t find it particularly funny or too “on the nose” or if you generally don’t appreciate “good guy” (even of the buffoon variety) cops in media, but it’s the same as the “sprinkle some crack on him” jokes from Chapelle: the police are butt of the joke."

1563,2020-06-24 16:36:48,herkfg,"I don't necessarily agree. I think the police are sometimes the butt of the joke on the show but this particular joke is played off as him being a little bit of a scamp but showing his competence. I've watched a couple of seasons and the subtext never feels like the principle characters ruin lives and are oblivious to it. It's just treated like The Office with more positive vibes, not some IASIP commentary on thoughtless, destructive people."
1564,2020-06-24 12:40:20,herkfg,I'd still say it's Bill Hader. You can argue as to which of them is the better comedian but as an actor on the whole Hader has shown far more versatility and range.
1565,2020-06-24 17:29:19,herkfg,"Samberg has contributed an awful lot to SNL and comedy in general but I wouldn't say his acting is that area of contribution. Cecily Strong is my personal MVP for overall range, though honestly when he's working with good material nobody touches Sandler."

1569,2020-06-24 22:36:15,herkfg,"Hader's versatility and range is on show to great effect in Paul, the Simon Pegg/Nick Frost/Seth Rogen comedy. His character's arc in that movie is freakin' phenomenal.

I'm willing to bet they started doing it because a lot of non-woke takes have been being mass upvoted on that subreddit and of course they can't allow that so they're minimizing that possibility as much as possible."

1613,2020-06-22 20:24:22,hdvvz1,"Lots of people quite successfully draw parallels between intersectional social justice and a religion. A very puritanical, fundamentalist and prescriptive religion. Most socialist movements are atheistic if not anti-theistic and (allegedly) anti hierarchical but humans need order. Religion (rightly or wrongly) can give humans a higher authority, purpose and moral code. Social justice has filled that niche. I’m an atheist but my principles (gathered from my country’s culture and upbringing) would be broadly Christian. Do to others as you would have done to you. Golden rule. I don’t need a god to believe in not being a prick."
1614,2020-06-22 21:27:24,hdvvz1,"So for transparency, I believe there is a higher being but don't personally subscribe to a denomination (Catholicism, Christianity, etc.) and I completely respect your point of view. It just gives me piece of mind and worst case scenario is I'm wrong and that's fine by me.

But back to your point. Honestly, that movement mirrors quite a bit of stuff that they did in the churches I went to. To me, it only takes 20 minutes to feel the room and see that they're going about everything the wrong way (like a church). I think the methods both go about it are inherently flawed. I can see where the parallels are drawn between their version of social justice and religion and I would be remiss if I didn't agree with that sentiment.

It does seem that there's just a bunch of people who crave any small amount of power/authority which definitely can showcase major insecurities. But to try and dictate what can and can't be said/done is fascist and/or oppressive, is it not? 

So wouldn't intersectional social justice and anything along those lines be blatant hypocrisy?"
1615,2020-06-22 21:40:35,hdvvz1,That’s part of the delicious irony. The anti fascist marches in the street beating those to disagree with him. The BLM protestors who ransack black neighbourhoods. People who crave power for powers sake are among the worst. Topical example. Someone who joins the police to solve crimes and be a hero. Someone who wants to “give back” someone with a vocation or calling. A good person. Doing a difficult job for the right reasons. A person who wants to join the police so that can push citizens around with force of the state behind them is a mini Hitler. Same could be said for religious leaders or social justice campaigners. We’re all hypocrites to some extent but me eating cow while not fancying mr riddles the cat is a bit different to raving about “equality” while asking for segregation.

1648,2020-06-19 20:29:54,hc7u37,"Sorry, but he is 100% right. As a person of mixed race, I have experienced this. I know it’s uncomfortable for many, but there is a lot of racism within the black community. “Gatekeepers” is a perfect term- people who think they get to decide who has a “right” to claim their blackness. Such a reversal from the one drop rule from the past. During slavery, mixed people were discriminated against and 100 percent considered black, and now, we are not allowed to claim our heritage because we are too white. We can’t win- which is exactly why we ARE a part of this conversation."

Two; he didn't parrot the leftist narrative word for word and expressed his own opinion.

he refused to improve his performance and got let go because he couldn't get off twitter,it has nothing to do with his wife but has to do with being on twitter most of his work hours and not giving proper care to his patients.

Gu received notice from Vanderbilt in May 2018 confirming that his residency contract would not be renewed after the third year of what is usually a five-year residency; the fourth year would have started on July 1, 2018. In a letter addressed to Gu, VUMC cited performance issues—as it did when he was placed on leave. A May 17 letter to Gu from VUMC General Counsel Michael Regier, which was obtained by the Duke Chronicle, cited ""lack of sufficient improvement in performance and conduct in key areas


Vanderbilt has said in a prior email statement that the decision not to renew Gu's contract was not a result of his criticism of Trump, his lawsuit, or his public opposition to racism. The hospital has said previously that all disciplinary actions against Gu relate to his work performance and professionalism."

The Black supremacy thing went in one ear our the other. I had to Google when it happened, I thought it was months ago, because I really stopped paying attention to him. 

But now I've been drawn back in by his continued buffcoonery and I'm at the point that I don't just not like him I actually can't stand him and would not watch anything he's in. 

I was thinking of starting up Brooklyn Nine nine again but I deadass cannot stand to see his face anymore. I think even White Chicks is ruined 😭"
1826,2020-07-01 06:28:39,hiozuy,"He keeps propping up this idea that Black People getting too close to equality would result in a negative outcome.

Over and over he cautions against a fight for equal rights, that sounds eerily similar to the way men claim women can't be trusted to be in power because of ""hormones"". Apparently black people can't be trusted to be out from under foot, without trying to put some one else under theirs.

Does Terry Crews believe that were he given equality, that he would presume himself superior? Are his caveats to BLM motivated by his own desire for supremacy? Nah, of course not. Terry Crews believes himself to be a black exception. He's the lotus who grew from the mire of black culture.

His sentiments echoes that of Jim Crow era propaganda where it was purported that black people couldn't be trusted to be integrated, couldn't be trusted to vote and couldn't be trusted to not rape their white women.

Terry Crews can shove his ""there goes the neighborhood"" stepin fetchit tweets right up his Dockers covered ass."

1835,2020-06-30 17:07:47,hiozuy,"Terry Crews has made a career out of being a safe black man with muscles, the hoops he jumps through to garner white acceptance are endless.

Can we just start a gofundme to get him off Twitter?"
1838,2020-07-01 06:29:33,hiozuy,What he do??
1839,2020-07-01 18:36:21,hiozuy,What did he do?
1840,2020-07-01 17:46:35,hiozuy,"White woman checking in - I just think all of his tweets about black supremacy are pointless??? I was speaking to a co-worker the other day when he initially tweeted about this. My co-worker was arguing that he agreed with the overall value of what Crews' was saying and didn't get why people were so mad about it. I told him that that was the point, of course he agrees with what Crews' is saying, it's common sense and that BLM supporters/protesters aren't arguing for their lives to be better than someone else's, just to be BETTER, and that by tweeting about rampant black supremacy was feeding into the negative perception of the protests.

For me it's easily comparable to the feminist movement - there are obviously women who are violently transphobic or who genuinely believe themselves to be better than men who also identify as feminists, but as an adult I can recognize that that doesn't downgrade the entire movent nor what we're fighting for, and I can still proudly say I am a feminist. Similarly, I do not align with the NBPP and also recognize that it is only a microscopic fraction of BLM protesters who share their more extreme beliefs, and thus I am able to seperate the two. It's possible to fight for a similar objective without a similar rhetoric and that's what really bugs me about this, Crews is just piling onto the idea that BLM is a supremacist movement when it's NOT and it literally takes 2 minutes of lazy Googling to figure that out. I hope that there will be a time when we can talk about how to navigate the internalized racism on both sides of the divide, but in order to do that we need to have equal ground and mutual respect which starts here and now, by supporting those who need it. 

Anyway. Just seems like writing off an entire organization as negative due to ""a few bad apples"" is a pretty high double standard considering the bad apples employed by the police have gotten a pass for decades."

As a man who got rich and famous doing 2 of the few things that give black people wealth, sports and entertainment I think he’s much too far removed from the struggles of the every day black American, to understand what he’s saying and why it’s so fucked up. I think I know what he’s trying to say, and I’m pretty sure he meant well, but what he’s said can be interpreted in many different ways, and the damage he’s done with the statement outweighs the good. Honestly I’m proud of the personal growth he’s accomplished, but he’s done so much damage and refuses to listen to his fellow black Americans on why what he said is hurtful."

It’s one of the only ways because systemic racism excludes black people from positions of power explicitly or implicitly, unless they are entertaining. Most black millionaires and billionaires started off in sports or entertainment. You can’t say that about most Caucasian millionaires and billionaires.

And you know what’s demeaning? Being told by man who no longer faces the same kind of prejudice because of his recognizable face, telling us that we better not go to far when we’re not even equal yet. As someone put it “please let us get to the peak of equality before we get to the slippery slope.” We’re still begging for the police to get prosecuted. We’re still begging for an end to medical racism. We’re nowhere near close to black supremacy."

I’m not just fighting for me, I’m fighting for the men and women who are still in jail for minuscule amounts of weed, while the same people who put them there get rich off of selling it in legal states. I’m fight for the people who see screwed by our school-prison pipeline. Sure, there are people who don’t need help. But we can’t focus just on the wins.

They aren’t wrong but one of the main points of protest is that a persons skin colour still effects the persons opportunities in life. I am saying they are narrow in their thinking if they honestly believe that all someone needs to be successful is smarts, charisma and strength. There are a lot more obstacles that individuals shouldn’t face on their own or that shouldn’t exist."

If this is what you mean then you’re ignoring thousands of variables that are at play."

1945,2020-06-30 19:17:19,hioks1,"It's painful, to even have to try and explain why Terry Crews' statement is wrong. Imagine being in need, asking for help or support and your neighbour telling you ""Yeah, but....""

I really just don't get it. There are well intentioned people who are being blinded by distractions. You have a part of your society who is saying ""Please. Our lives matter. We deserve to be treated equal. There shouldn't be a system in place to support the murder of our people. We shouldn't continue to be treated as though we are less than you"" and the answer we get from some people is ""Yeah, but, what about us? Do you think you're better than us? Will you become better than us?""

Division, by distraction is real. And it affects all of our ability to move forward. Wanna know why it exists? Because, once we all support each other, the real people in power can no longer control us. And that's not a conspiracy theory. I'm not talking on a Rothschild level. In its simplest terms, it's better for the people in power to have everyone below them focused on fighting amongst each other than against them."

1954,2020-06-30 17:25:08,hioks1,"Go ahead and kill me but I don’t think he’s doing anything wrong. He’s clearly with the movement and agrees that black lives matter. As a black man with a voice of power I think it’s a good thing he encourages empathy and thought. Most people aren’t smart and can’t grasp movements and bandwagon onto things. I think even though this is a legitimate movement, that fact still stands. Most people are sheep and don’t really know how to conduct themselves. Hearing someone encourage a sense of working together isn’t unproductive. If he was saying something like all lives matter, I’d be right there with you. But he’s just trying to share his opinion. I’m sure I’ll get downvoted but what does other people think about this?"

1962,2020-06-30 15:00:44,hioks1,"Well. I can't speak for Terry. And as I alluded to in the post it's tough to make sense of it. However, my interpretation of it is that ""Hopefully, the Black Lives Matter movement doesn't succeed so far that it makes Blacks feel they are better than any other other race"". Which, in a microcosm, is a noble statement. But let's get to a place to where the world agrees that Black Lives Matter, before we worry about if the scales are unfairly tipping. 

In essence... As a black man.... With a platform... Saying Black Lives Matter... And leaving it at that... In this moment... Would suffice.

You can fight for equality without pandering to those who don't agree with you. You can be unapologetic about how you feel about the systemic oppression of your people. Terry Crews is the only person I've ever seen talk about Black Lives Better. So why does it even need to be a part of the conversation?"
1963,2020-06-30 15:58:05,hioks1,"I have no idea why but he thinks BLM is going to going to become a slippery slope into black supremacy. It's fucking idiotic. 


He is always hesitant to just fully advocate for BLM because of this fear.  Slippery slope is a fallacy so he's just wrong. How are black people going to transition from oppressed to oppressers. It's laughable. He's being an Uncle Tom to not offend his white followers and he could be the black guy racists agree with."
1964,2020-06-30 17:36:18,hioks1,"No need to down vote you. I disagree with the take, tho. I still feel that it's ok to say Black Lives Matter and leave it at that, if you feel that way. There is no Black Lives Better movement. There is no All Other Lives Don't Matter movement. There are elements of dissent in EVERY movement. But it should never take away from the cause. People didn't jump off of Fuck Cancer because of Lance Armstrong (and many others like him who are only in it for fame and profit).

My point is just... You can support Black Lives Matter, without presenting the case of the all of the possible things that COULD go wrong. If anyone thinks that the movement, at its core, is for reasons other than creating equality for Black people, they're using it as an excuse to not stand for it.  And if so, then say that. Own your stance (not you personally, but in general), without borrowing courage from conspiracy theories, or presenting potential issues."
1965,2020-06-30 17:36:03,hioks1,The thing is there’s NO legitimate way what he’s proposing is going to happen. The goal of the movement has never stood for that and its only brought up to weaken or distract from the main point. However this argument is one of the things his white audience would agree to so he’s trying to be down with the cause without offending his supporters. The last part of that tweet is nothing more than dog whistle to the likes that Trump and other notable far right sympathizers think and say.
1966,2020-07-01 10:06:33,hioks1,Yeah so why he wasting our time and his platform with this basic bitch shit
1967,2020-06-30 18:29:08,hioks1,"Very well said, so what I got from your reply was that he (Terry Crews) was taking away from the current momentum on racial equality. Which is why he's getting a ton of crap about his posts? Timing is everything and he has been displaying ""bad timing"" in his post it seems.

That's the bad thing about Twitter and most social media in general. It's very difficult to articulate one's ideas or views in so few words."
1968,2020-06-30 18:44:46,hioks1,There’s a difference between fighting injustices and oppression and literally saying your race is the best . If you check social there are a LOT of black people who do this I get it’s trying to fight white supremacy but it’s not the best way to go about it
1969,2020-07-01 08:03:08,hioks1,"But of course when I went to r/conservatives they didn't and probably will not consider what you said.

1972,2020-06-30 20:42:18,hioks1,"So dumb.  We've been fighting for centuries just to be considered equal but Terry's dumb ass somehow thinks we're gonna skip right past that into supremacy? 

Put it in reverse, Terry!"
1973,2020-06-30 17:39:39,hioks1,Yup this just reeks of fence sitting. If he wants to go all the way into saying he doesn’t agree then he should just do that.
1974,2020-06-30 17:40:04,hioks1,"I don’t think he’s looking at it this way, but you made a really convincing argument. 95% of the black lives movement is doing the right thing. I completely see your point that there’s no need to make excuses for the 5% of bad people that infect any group with numbers. Point taken and well argued my friend."
1975,2020-06-30 18:52:53,hioks1,"I don't even think it's a timing issue. How he feels is his right. But he needs to own it. Don't mask it by tieing in unsubstantiated theories. If he doesn't support Black Lives Matter movement, then say that. No one, but him and his ilk , said that Black Lives Matter more than others. If that were the case, than his point is legitimate. The point is that he shouldn't create a narrative and then argue against it.

The irony (or the reality) of all of this is that some folks, Crews included, are creating a false narrative about there being a false intent behind the movement. It's all about distracting, by division. The sad part is.... That it works."
1976,2020-06-30 19:03:54,hioks1,"What is a lot? Examples would be helpful, also. Is a lot, 50? 100? 10,000? I'm not trying to be cynical, here, but there are elements of distraction in every movement. It is also difficult to determine which social media accounts are legitimate or are just there to perpetuate the confusion you speak of. If you look at any of the protests. Real people. And listen to the concerns being voiced.... It's not that Blacks want to be better (let's be real for moment. You don't go from feeling oppressed, to expecting top tier status).

Take your post as example. I could easily twist those words into saying that you you think ALL BLACKS feel they should be better than all other races. But that's not what you're saying. I get that. My argument in all of these posts is that in the same vein as ""There are only a few bad cops""... ""There are always a few bad members of any movement"". The difference here, is that there is a SYSTEM in place to support the bad behaviours of those few cops. But clearly, based on this conversation alone, there isn't a system that supports the bad behaviours of bad folks in the movement."
1977,2020-07-02 21:47:56,hioks1,You sit at home all day thinking of black people and raging on Reddit . You basically sit at home thinking about black men in your free time. You’re a closet homosexual with cuckold tendencies like most latino men. That’s why your women love black dick so much
1978,2020-07-01 08:08:39,hioks1,The conservatives subreddit loves him and think he's preaching. Surprise surprise
1979,2020-06-30 20:46:39,hioks1,It's likes he's justifying the position black people are in now because if they get more power it's going to go too far.
1980,2020-07-01 18:59:41,hioks1,"I'd still say that it's important that the movement checks itself regularly because anger and outrage ARE slippery slopes. It's easy to get caught up in frustration and go to far, even for the good ones, this is, IMO, true for every movement."
1981,2020-07-01 18:54:58,hioks1,"But hes saying that we should make sure that it doesn't turn into a black supremacy thing, which is fair. 

I doubt an angry mob has brakes, no matter who makes up the mob. We're human and, historically, we're not good at stopping with such things (french revolution for example). 

Nowhere does he state that he doesn't actually support BLM"

1984,2020-07-01 19:12:38,hioks1,"You mean like, how every other group fighting or who fought for equal rights ends up taking over the world? Suffrage? LGTBQ? Natives? In the past 100+ years, I've never heard anyone who was on the right side of history, accuse those groups of threatening to achieve ""Better than everyone else"" status. You only really accuse those groups when your real fear is losing your advantage, let's keep it 100. And having that advantage is the whole premise behind any Equal Rights fight. The real fight is ""We don't want to give up our advantage to allow you equality"".

Terry's stance (or statement), is irresponsibly creating an unsubstantiated narrative based on fear. There are people who will read that and consider that it's not worth even starting to support the movement, because it may get out of hand. History tells us of how rare, if at all, that happens.

Besides... How can your life be considered ""better"" if the basis of your fight is behind police and systemic brutality? What's the worse thing that will happen? Cops who murder blacks will be held accountable and therefore result in less occurrences. Court systems will judge blacks the same way as their other race peers. That's not ""better"" than anyone else. If it is, then everyone should be fighting for the same thing anyway."
1985,2020-07-01 19:37:16,hioks1,"I'd say that BLM is bigger and more active than most of those other movements rn, but the LGBTQ+ one is a good point.   


I still think that keeping in mind how such movements that gain traction can turn out, to ensure that it doesn't happen, no matter how unlikely, would be the best thing to do. People that will not support a movement because it could turn bad wouldn't support the movement in the first place, but it's still a fair point and it definetly gives room to attack the movement without any real basis.   


I'm not arguing about the current goals of BLM but of the possibility that it might not stop there, should it achieve those things.   
Anger, Frustration and outrage are slippery slopes, especially if the movement somehow turns into a large majority."

1996,2020-06-29 13:34:17,hhqfka,"The reason that people were mad is because it was seen as distracting from the primary issue at hand, which is institutional racism and police brutality. BLM has constantly been accused of being a racist black supremacy group by people on the right and so Terry's comments were seen as someone validating those opinions. Saying ""black supremacist are just as bad as white supremacists"" at this time is kinda like saying ""All lives matter"" in response to ""black lives matter""....yeah, no one said black supremacists are okay, so bringing that up is kinda not needed.

Add on to this he got criticism for his response to Gabrielle Unions criticism of NBC and America's Got Talent. She claimed she encountered a lot of racist and unprofessional behavior during her time there and currently has a discrimination lawsuit against NBC. Terry jumped in and said he never experienced any bad behavior and that AGT is one of the most diverse places he's worked at and started praising NBC so people claimed that he wasn't supporting her.

He also received heat a few months back for some Instagram posts he made while in Shanghai during the Hong Kong protests. He's said before that he'd love to host a Chinese version of America's Got Talent and so his posts were seen as pandering.

He's also received criticism because he used to be addicted to porn but now has gone hard (ha) against pornography and masturbation and that has rubbed people (ha) the wrong way.

He also said some stupid comments about how children of gay people are ""severely malnourished"".

And finally you have the common phenomenon of overexposure. Terry's been involved in a lot of projects since the last few years and gets constant praise on the internet and that starts to annoy people."
1997,2020-06-29 19:05:30,hhqfka,"It's a sort of crab mentality. A certain mindset views someone thinking outside of the herds general consensus as an affront to them. In this instance these people don't want equality, but rather black supremacy. Terry understands that if the pendulum goes from one extreme to the other it's never gonna stop swinging, and by arguing for them to not push an extreme his call for moderacy was met with typical vitriol Centrists deal with on social media."
1998,2020-06-29 17:11:50,hhqfka,"I think him taking NBC's side over Gabrielle Union's is a bigger issue. His response was""that's not been my experience"" which isn't ever relevant when it comes to people dealing with harassment, racism, and sexism in the workplace. It's worse than being apathetic because it leaves her on an island with a target on her back and implies what she experienced it's either insignificant or that he doesn't believe it happened. Why show support for NBC and not the victim?"
1999,2020-06-29 15:45:17,hhqfka,"Damn that's it? For fucks sake I believe this reaction against him is called facism. ""You're either with us or against us""."

2007,2020-06-29 20:44:13,hhqfka,"Is it really considered ""centrist"" if you can't decide between black supremacy and white supremacy? Two flavours of racism aren't ""opposed"" to each other. There're not some yin-yang duality. It's just a bunch of racism. And you don't solve it by balancing the racism."
2008,2020-07-01 17:22:52,hhqfka,"Even if anyone in the movement actually is advocating for Black Supremacy, it’s not Black Supremacy as framed as the exact opposite of White Supremacy though. Historically speaking that’s a false dichotomy which was fed to Americans and the rest of the world as Black Panthers and the like were demonized, imprisoned to this day, and their message warped into dangerous ideologies all for protecting Black and poor communities from state violence. Meanwhile White Supremacists literally advocate for genocide and through the decades lynched Black people and other people of color while preaching that their Whiteness as a marker of superiority over any other kind of person. 

Terry isn’t just “thinking outside the herds”, he’s a massive distraction that is spewing whataboutisms as “insightful” lessons. While people are trying to protest for equality he’s insisting to his clearly captive audience that they are a slippery slope, as if 13% of the country (and other minorities) having concrete equality in this country will result in them asking for/taking more and more and somehow end up being the Master Race if this continues."

2012,2020-06-30 14:52:59,hhqfka,"Agreed. I think he was trying to communicate that the fight for equality needs allies from everywhere. Some people read it as saying that black people aren't powerful enough to free themselves from oppression, and need white people to do it for them. Or, another negative way to read it was that he was trying to discredit the movement for equality because he was fearful of the slippery slope fallacy that it would literally bring Black Supremacy. That's a literal way to read it, and it's patently absurd.

The message was muddled. And the timing was wrong. This movement has a very significant amount of support from white allies. There was no need to paint a picture that white people weren't involved. They've been involved straight from Minneapolis."
2013,2020-06-29 13:14:45,hhqfka,I feel like he's not wrong though. It's just not the power to the people phrase everyone wanted to hear. So now he's just a dirty Uncle Tom.

Which, IMHO, is simultaneously reasonable, and bullshit. 

It's true that men can't provide female opinions, but Mother's aren't the only source of those opinions, and it eliminates the idea that others in your life outside of your family, can have effects on an individuals growth."
2018,2020-06-29 15:02:52,hhqfka,"Given Terry's comments about gay people, and general attitude towards China, masturbation, and systematic racism I don't think this is a case of ""the left eating their own"".

2022,2020-06-29 18:54:07,hhqfka,"It's something I've tried to understand for a while and haven't been able to. If anyone can help educate me I'd be very appreciative. I'm a middle class white male. My exposure to the black community for the most part has been limited to my time in the military. I feel like we are in a completely different situation compared to the rest of the US.

I've had a few black friends that were accused of being too white. One of them because they liked ""too many white things and having too many white friends"" and another for having light skin. 

I don't know if it's blacks being racist against whites, jealousy, anger of circumstance, or something else.

I think it's a mixture. Sometimes I understand why people are that way. Others I don't. Black on black racism I don't understand. 

Example. I have a white uncle who grew up in an all black neighborhood and he was poor. He was beat up a lot just because he was white. He lived in the projects and his apartment was targeted more than any other apartment. I understand why he his racist. It's wrong. But I get it. 

A guy down the street from me is racist for all the wrong reasons. ""Free government handouts"" and yada yada yada. Education could fix his point of view but it's probably too late for him. Him... I don't understand. 

I think an understanding of each other is what is required to stop racism. Beyond racism. I think it's what's required to solve a lot of the issues we see today. Too many of us want to be understood without wanting understanding the other. We hear them but try to use their words to confirm our currently set belief. 

I've been guilty of that myself. I'm sure I will continue to be in the future. All I can say is. I'm trying. Hopefully others are too."
2023,2020-06-30 20:18:43,hhqfka,"Okay, that's what I was thinking. But, how does that work? Is it possible for a Black person to be racist toward another Black person? Maybe I'm overthinking."

They're quickly buried in a landslide of more vocal, better educated, more powerful supporters, but they do exist. Usually they are swooped up by reactionaries like Candace Owens as a way to discredit the entire movement and ""show who the real racists are,"" but the best thing to do is to let them fade into obscurity. Maybe Crews thought they had a much wider platform than they really do, or maybe he knew someone personally who was ""white-shaming,"" and wanted to offer a voice for allies. Either way, his tweet has way more attention than any message he might've been responding to (because those things tend to fade into obscurity where they belong)."
2030,2020-06-30 19:08:43,hhqfka,Thank you. I think people are missing this very point. BLM doesn't exclude anyone. Terry Crews doesn't know what he's talking about. It's not about having a different opinion. It's about spreading misinformation.
2031,2020-06-30 21:17:09,hhqfka,"Yes Blacks aren't all one group there's multiple different ways blacks will be 'racist' to each other 

Like lightskin vs darkskin for example both black but different shades there's stereotypes of both on each other held by blacks in both males and females.
A lot of darker skinned black girls claim black males are discriminatory against them and treat lighter skinned black girls In higher regard and to be more attractive.
This is pushed by the music industry where there's an apparent favouritism towards lighter skinned girls pushed in the rap music and videos.

I've also heard people claim films and TV shows reninforce these stereotypes by usually casting the main pretty/ sexy character as a lighter skinned black girl and her friend will always be a darker skinned black girl that is loud and rowdy, likes to fight etc. 
Due to these and probably other reasons there exists darker black girls that don't like lighter ones out of jealousy, lighter ones that feel they are treated unfairly by darker skinned girls due to societal ideals and no fault of their own.

A completely different kind would be for example black people in African countries or other parts of the world having a stereotypical negative view on all African Americans as thugs, drugs dealers, deadbeats etc. from a biased outside perspective. 

Then of course a group of Jamaican kids bullying a Ghanaian kid because he's different I'd say should be classed as a racial matter even though they're both black (but I know people kinda have differing views on what's technically racist and some wouldn't count this as so)

In London there's Gangs of predominantly Jamaican males that will ride out and stab or shoot any Somalian male they can find because their rival gang is predominantly Somalian and murder any they come across whether they are affiliated or not (and vice versa)

Just some random examples I could think of I thought might be relevant didn't mean to make such a long reply."
2032,2020-06-29 17:05:43,hhqfka,">He's being kind to everyone, even those who don't deserve it.

That's kinda the problem people are starting to have with him.

Gabrielle Union said she experienced a unprofessional and racist behavior at AGT and filed a lawsuit and Terry, unprompted, said that he never experienced any racism there and started praising NBC.

China has been murdering protesters in Hong Kong and Terry, unprompted, posted a generic Instagram photo in front of the Chinese flag while visiting Shanghai and started praising China. After his comments about wanting more work in China this annoyed a lot of people.

Black people, white people, Asian people ,Hispanic people, etc. have been protesting police brutality, systematic racism against minorities, and people putting up monuments of racist traitors in public squares and Terry, unprompted, made a Tweet about how trying to get rid of white supremacy without white people makes black supremacy, which doesn't really pass any sort of logic test.

He seems to have a habit of inserting himself into issues and making odd, statements that could at best be described as fence-sitting or at worst be considered pandering to more conservative audiences."
2033,2020-06-30 21:29:10,hhqfka,"Okay. I wouldn't call those examples racist. I would consider that colorism, prejudice and tribalism. Anyhow, thanks for the reply."

A literally anti-semitic white supremacist who said that MLK was a tool of Satan won a Republican primary in North Carolina *this year*. Without white support, any equality movement is DOA because at least some portion of the opposition is completely insane.

I dont see how this is pandering at all. It looks like an addicts mental process to understand that others are as flawed as them. If anything, blame a 12-step program. Its also the source of his strange porn takes.

I understand this behavior rubbing someone the wrong way, as some of his takes certainly rub me the wrong way, but to argue that it comes from anything but a good place is disingenuous at best and outright racist at worst (speaking specifically to the Twitter response here)."

Terry is just the latest target of the cancel culture mob because he won’t fall into line like a good dog and therefore must be destroyed.

And it's not just a strong character they seek, but the kind of strength that makes somebody else afraid-they want to assume a powerful enough to hold the enemy at a distance. These Sixes display a forcefulness that comes from no wanting to be weak, and they don't allow for weakness in themselves....""

"".....Sexual Sixes have a need not just for strength but for intimidation. As Naranjo suggests, this expression of intimidation is very much the essence of the character; if they appear strong, they won't be attacked. ....""

"".....Sexual Sixes give off the impression that they could get violent with anybody at any time, but that doesn’t mean that they have no fear. It is precisely out of a sense of fear that their anticipation of an attack comes-there is a somewhat paranoid imagining of danger, a belief that anyone can turn into a threat. However, these Sixes usually do not look afraid; their visible character could hardly be called ""fearful"" from the outside.

In contrast to the Self-Preservation Six, who backs away from threats, the couterphobic Sexual Six tends to move toward risky situations, feeling a sense of safety in actually confronting danger rather than hiding from it or avoiding it. They convince themselves (and others) that they are not victims of fear; they are convinced that fear is an emotion that should be eliminated systemically.....""

"".....The fact that these Sixes regularly move against danger (or perceived danger) can, at times, give them the appearance of a rebel, a daredevil, a risk taker, an adrenaline junkie, or a troublemaker. In some cases, Sexual Sixes may be prone to megalomania or having a ""hero complex."" In their own way, they seek to be ""good guys"" to avoid being punished. They may have the illusion that they are spontaneous, but they tend not to be.

Sexual Sixes tend to be very contrarian: they always have an argument at hand to refute and contradict an opinion. Instead of thinking in terms of ""best-case"" or ""worst-case"" scenarios, they think in terms of contrarian scenarios-if the trend is for others to focus on the worst, they will focus on the best; but if everyone is focusing on the best, they will assert the worst.....""

You decided you're going to write in Sanders.  What you're doing there is deciding that instead of working within the realities of our current system where one of two people are going to become the president, you'd rather protest that reality and write-in somebody else.  I can't help but note that I that's pointless because it's SO token rebellion, but whatever.  The immediate impact of a Trump victory will obviously be much more damaging to your leftist goals, but you're willing to accept those problematics because the system is so damaged.

But then, it comes to things like defund the police, and you're going ""whoa whoa whoa,"" we shouldn't call for radical upheaval of the system because we've got to deal with the practical realities of what's going to happen within the immediate.

TL;DR: When you're rejection of the system has no ability to impact anything other than your personal ability stay true to your philosophy, you seem to be all in.  ""Write in Bernie!""  But when the rejection of the system is rooted in an attempt to produce actual change in society, you feel like it's going too far and we should tweak the system from within."

The Democratic party nominated Joe Biden, a person to the right of the policy positions you mentioned at the start of your post. We can't expect everyone to stick with the same set of beliefs and policies year after year, or even slowly shift them. A good chunk of people are finding things to be angry at and lose consistency in their beliefs in the process. 

This doesn't really tackle your points 3 & 4 though. For those I'd just say media companies are watching out for themselves. They have a lot less to lose by removing potentially controversial content than keeping it up. 

>We're removing offensive art

2113,2020-06-28 17:59:59,hhiizu,"Twitter is a pretty poor reflection of reality in important ways. Although Twitter has a lot of diversity for the internet, it's whiter, wealthier, younger, more educated, and more male than the population. Only about 20% of Americans have a Twitter account. Only 13% of tweets are about politics. And 97% of those political tweets are written by the most active 10% of users.

I like to remind myself that Joe Biden led the Democratic primary polls for every single day of 2019 and the majority of 2020. He won easily, and particularly among non-white voters. Yet, if you were a Twitter user on the left, you might think Biden was an underdog. I know plenty of people who were *shocked* that Biden won the primary.

But even beyond the demographic skew of Twitter, it's sort of no surprise that the kinds of ideas that float around there and especially the *framing* of those ideas are often unpopular and provocative. Then the medium disincentives serious ideas explained plainly. Instead, the format and culture promote combat, certainty, simplicity, and envelope-pushing.

Then I looked into it and saw that what *most* people on the left are pushing for is transferring funding from police department budgets to be put toward other social services that have proven to reduce crime such as housing, education, mental healthcare, etc...

Now, how can we reconcile abolish the police and defund the police?  Well I'll point you toward my personal lord and savior, Bernie Sanders, during his 2016 campaign he made a point warning against ""half loaf"" policies.  Basically my interpretation was that if you ask for half a loaf, by the time it gets through the grind of Congress you'll end up with crumbs.  Whereas if you ask for the full loaf you're more likely to get to the half you wanted initially once everything is said and done...

In my mind defunding the police is a half loaf policy, it will be met with great opposition and whittled down to the bare minimum crumbs, abolish the police asks for the full loaf, its extreme and will be met with even greater opposition but most on the left are willing to give away half of it willingly in order to get to their true policy goals..."
2119,2020-06-29 00:42:10,hhiizu,"On the first point (and honestly all of them) you really need to do the barest hint of research and you’ll realize that they don’t mean what you’ve written here.

I don’t have 10% of the writing ability of the very easily google able sources that’ll explain how “Defund the police” literally was never about there being no law enforcement, or letting literally everyone out of jail. It’s hard to argue against the weird idea you’ve created when it’s so far divorced from reality. 

Same thing for point five. You won’t find a good write up of anarchism or communism on reddit when you won’t even do ten minutes of legitimate research into what people actually mean when they talk about them. Take some time to read about each of your points beyond whatever headline you saw on reddit and you’ll find that people do actually put thought into what they care about."
2120,2020-06-28 18:23:17,hhiizu,"I disagree. The left isn't going 2 fast 2 furious. They're getting closer to their true equilibrium point. 'Draining the swamp', so to speak. 

Radicals draw people in with reasonable ideas and try to lock you into place. When they have enough supporters, they'll slowly let out their extreme principles a little bit at a time. Over time, some people notice these things and move away from the radical group, while others become fully integrated.

If you feel that the left is becoming too radical, I believe that this is a flawed view based on (what I assume is) your need to 'stay leftist'. Instead of simply leaving, you'd rather have them change to fit what you believe ought to be. Instead of dismissing them as 'just another group of radicals', it hits you closer to home because you have once identified with them.

Well I'm here to tell you that you never had to participate in this game in the first place. I want to target the entire premise of your beliefs. You can agree with *ideas*, but don't have to call them left or right. It sucks you into the kind of mob mentality that afflicts fans of entertainment sports."
2121,2020-06-28 18:12:20,hhiizu,"A lot of your view seems to suppose a lack of reasonableness behind the views that are being espoused by taking the most extreme representative of an idea as the essence of it. But, like everyone else, the left is mostly reasonable despite its excesses.

1) From [this essay](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/opinion/sunday/floyd-abolish-defund-police.html) about abolishing the police:

> But don’t get me wrong. We are not abandoning our communities to violence. We don’t want to just close police departments. We want to make them obsolete.   
>  
>We should redirect the billions that now go to police departments toward providing health care, housing, education and good jobs. If we did this, there would be less need for the police in the first place. 

You can see many other reasonable statements in the essay. The general point of abolishing the police is not to leave a vacuum of anarchy, but to replace police with institutions that focus on restorative justice rather than retributive justice. It wouldn't be lawlessness, a world in which there was no enforcement of laws and punishment, but different institutions than the police would handle them. Same with prisons: There are ways of punishing people that doesn't mean locking them up in cells. 

You may find this too utopian, too idealistic, and that might make you afraid of the consequences. Lucky for you, the people who want to abolish the police don't want to do it overnight, nor do they think that is possible:

> This change in society wouldn’t happen immediately, but the protests show that many people are ready to embrace a different vision of safety and justice. 

You should only worry when people are still chipping away at these reforms, shrinking the police, when crime is significantly rising, anarchy occurring, and they refuse to reconsider their approach given the facts on the ground. But maybe that will never happen. Maybe they will reform the police away."

2125,2020-06-28 19:36:35,hhiizu,"What would you consider leftist? Liberals, Democrats, progressives, communists? I ask because the concerns you've listed cover the entire ""left"" political spectrum, and many points aren't politically ""left"" at all. For example, you say your a leftist, but don't understand Communism. This is a very valid and fair position to have. But to be an actual Communist, one has to be leftist, but most people on the left would agree communism goes to far. Same with the anarchists. It wouldn't make sense for an anarchist not be fast a furious. Same when you talk about abolishing the police. This isn't the view of your average leftists, but the far left, which, anarchists, by definition, must demand. Most on the left are proponents of defunding the police, but not abolishing. Even in Minneapolis, they are not asking to have zero police. But the idea is that the police there now are so corrupt, they can't be fixed, so we need to dismantle that force and start over.

Another point to consider. Take away the extreme points you mentioned (communism; abolishing the police). The left has been compromising (and even contrubuting) on social change for over 50 years (we have had issues since the formation of the country, but the civil rights movement started in the 1960s). The progress made since then has been embarrassing and basically non-existent. It hasn't been working and moving fast is what is needed. I think there is a legitimate argument to be made that censoring media is not the right way to do this, but it's not longer the time for compromise.

Edit: A word"
2126,2020-06-28 20:00:29,hhiizu,I have to admit that I read your post twice and I have very little idea what you're talking about.  It would help a lot if you laid out your basic political values to see where you stand generally before moving on to the specifics.

Yes, some people have radical views. The left has always had a radical wing. That doesn't mean that they are a majority, or are in power, or can actually do anything.

2129,2020-06-28 18:18:05,hhiizu,"1) Nobody wants a world without law-enforcement. ""Abolish The Police"" really isn't the best choice for a slogan, I'll admit that, but the point is essentially just to replace the police through different institution which would be more decentralized, more specialized and more accountable to their local communities.

2) As a leftist, you will have to accept the fact that there will always be groups of other leftists you fundamentally disagree with. The more extreme elements of these groups may even seem utterly insane to you. The left has always been incredibly divided and that probably won't change in the near future. The fact that the right constantly makes up strawmen of popular leftist beliefs really doesn't help.

3) I don't think that's happening on a large enough scale to be worrying. As you said, a lot of media contains quite problematic elements ... and yet all of it still is readily available for consumption. 

4) That's what happens when leftist values are appropriated by liberals who just care about the aesthetics of ""wokeness"". I'm not a fan of it either, but it's not an issue with the left going too far. It's just people not really understanding the values they claim to hold imo

5) Left-Wing Anarchism and ""Communism"" have essentially the same goal: A society organized entirely around non-hierarchical principles and democracy. The main difference is that anarchists try to directly work towards this society, while communists (the actual ideology you are probably refering to is called Marxism-Leninism) are of the opinion that a strong, worker-owned state will have to be implemented first in order to combat counter-revolution and foreign subversion. As an anarchist I obviously take issue with this approach, but historically speaking, most post-revolutionary societies really didn't have much of a choice. Had Russia not implemented a strong state and supressed its people in certain ways, it would have simply been wiped out by imperialist powers. I don't think that excuses their actions, but it definitely allows us to better understand past socialist experiments."

2166,2020-06-28 18:01:40,hhiizu,"I’m thinking of any bureaucratic system that needs dismantling. Let me get back to you with specific examples. 

In terms of robbery and all, upper class communities will have security, and others will organize a community watch. 

Detectives would have to stay on since they’re the ones who solve crimes and robberies after."
2167,2020-06-28 19:37:14,hhiizu,"In general, entirely destroying an existing governmental structure and replacing it with an untested system led by inexperienced people leads to the sort of basic problems that government was designed to prevent: chaos, corruption, etc.

If you organize a community watch, who regulates its members? What happens the first time a member of the community watch fires a weapon at a perceived criminal? What happens if racist white members of the community watch decide to stick to the white houses in their neighborhood or to harass their black neighbors? 

What if, in an especially crime-ridden neighborhood, people start dealing drugs and carrying illegal guns openly in the streets - from whom can the people of that neighborhood request help to control the crime problem? Whoever it is, if they are armed and/or have any law enforcement authority, they'll have the potential to abuse that authority. And if they are unarmed and have no authority, how will they stop crime?

Will you get rid of traffic cops? If not, you're still going to have police bias affecting who gets pulled over. But if you do eliminate traffic police, compliance with traffic regulations will plummet.

Will you disallow police responding to mental health calls, even before you have a new and better system in place? If so, who will respond to the calls (which presumably are only made when someone seems to present a danger to themself or others)? Unarmed, untrained community members? *Armed*, untrained community members? Who will be accountable for their behavior?

Edit to add: mainly I'm aiming to convince that it's often easier to fix a troubled system, or at least *keep it in place while a new one is being developed*, than to abolish it without replacement."
2168,2020-06-29 20:53:56,hhiizu,"You’ve asked such excellent and deep reaching questions, I had to take a moment to think about each one. So allow me to attempt:

- community watch would be regulated I imagine by whoever assumes the role of police chief. Or sheriff. 

I’m thinking of how Cuba arranged it’s local protection militias after the revolution. 

They would have to get deputized after having a minimal threshold for acceptance (no criminal record, bonded, knows CPR, licensed to carry.)

The advantage is that these are people FROM the community serving their own community. If racism does occur. It would have to go through the same process than as if there was a police officer - a review, etc. I feel they would have less need to abuse their authority than cops do. 

It would be a good idea to keep detectives, since they have active cases all the time, and their job is mainly investigative. 

Now, gang violence is pretty bad already. And it’s only gotten worse as the police budget skyrocketed the last couple decades. DestabilIng drug gangs like the police do creates power struggles and more violence. 

Gangs operate by turf, and violence comes out of issues with who sells what drugs to which people on what property - in other words, their ecology of crime doesn’t change much with cops around or not.  

It would be important to set up a committee made up of neighborhood people to ask what the most effective way is of curtailing gang violence. 

Traffic cops can mostly be eliminated with the advent of AI and surveillance. Automatic tickets to speeders etc, sent by mail. Have a small core of emergency responders for big accidents and so forth. 

Police should never respond to mental health calls - it should be social workers and experts, with police backup if they request it. 

Body cams have become ubiquitous and cheap - every member of the new police force wears it and learn from the situations presented. 

As I mentioned before, community members know their people, and if they meet minimum standards of training (firearm, CPR), then they just need to be taught protocol for certain situations. Community members policing their own neighborhood is good because they know the people and are sensitive with their issues. 

And if I may challenge you back, the PROBLEM with keeping the system in place is that you can’t root out corruption that way. They system remains corrupt until it is dismantled."

I’m asking this question because you seem to be quoting the Manifesto and throwing in “Marxism” everywhere even when it’s irrelevant.

Take the title quote, for example:

> ""There are, besides, eternal truths, such as Freedom, Justice, etc., that are common to all states of society. But Communism abolishes eternal truths, it abolishes all religion, and all morality, instead of constituting them on a new basis."" - Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx

To the average person, taken completely out of context, this quote looks like it’s saying that Marxists want to destroy freedom, justice, and truth itself for good. And of course it looks like that if you don’t have an understanding of the (primarily Young Hegelian) German Idealist philosophy Marx and Engels were criticizing when they made that statement."

It’s pretty common to see people refute police brutality (which statistically effects black people more) with ‘black on black’ crime. As if it takes away from how damaging and real it is that black people, and minorities in general are far more effected by police brutality than white people. 

The reason the ‘lefts’ don’t bring it up is because every time it’s used, someone uses it to discredit the struggles of black people. Crimes against each other within the black community are undeniably real but when we’re talking about how many police kill black people a year, isn’t the time to bring up crime in the black community. **You’re just victim blaming.** 

If you didn’t know that question you asked in the beginning has a racist undertone, but if you’re genuinely concerned in the struggles of the black community instead of just making us look to be murders, the reasons ties into the roots. Aka, generational trauma, and yes the system. It’d do you some good to look into that. I can help if you want. 

Have you ever heard of white on white crime? Asian in Asian crime? Native on native crime?  No, because in the news it’s only ever called crime. Not gang violence, like it is for black people. 

 Black people and all minority do have the cards stacked against them. It’s not according to the ‘left’ it’s according to literally all the statistics you can find on low income neighborhoods, unemployment, graduation rates, mass incarceration, and the amount of black people and minorities that actually get a higher education. 

You should look up the study of how having a ‘black sounding name’ on your resume effects your chances of getting a job.

The ‘lefts’ aren’t just making claims, their stating facts with immense amounts of evidence. Also the left isn’t a political party recognized by the us. Which is what it sound like your trying to say with “the left the left isn’t doing much to change that”. 

Which is again untrue because leftist have brought about many petitions and movements to bring awareness to these subjects of social/racial inequality. 


It would be good if that 3rd paragraph had any statistics, but yes governors in America (regardless of their party really) have been doing a shitty job, and worsen these conditions of the poor cities. It’d be a lie to say politicians weren’t taking advantage of POC and the people in those cities.

Thank you for the anecdotal story, but your friends story can’t speak for everyone. 

It’s sad you consider racial inequality not to be a real issue, but everything you mentioned after is valid. 

Something I think you fail to realize is that leftist also care about the abolishment of systems that preserve suffering such as the ones you mentioned. 

Though I don’t necessarily like the names we assign to politics and the party system. 


TLDR: Stop victim blaming. I agree with you about class issues, but that doesn’t mean discredit the issues of POC."

2252,2020-08-18 20:42:07,ic4d13,"One of your main logical problems is conflating Democrats with the left. The Democrats are a center right party. Real leftists prioritize things like international peace, social freedom (e.g. no drug war), medicare for all, public education, and other social services. Democrats fight against such things but can still pretend to be leftists because they are slightly to the left of Republicans.

BLM is not a Dem movement, and the more experienced, older black/leftist activists know that the Democrats are as much in opposition to social programs as the Republicans. They know it's a class war, although racism is certainly a tool of that class war.

It's not a simple situation, and the powers that be keep it that way so that the people can be easily confused and divided. That doesn't mean that systemic racism isn't real. Black people have been a particular target for exploitation since slavery, but that doesn't mean that all people aren't affected. This is why a lot of poor white people have always supported Black movements. 

If the working class white people that support Trump ever realize what's really going on, namely that social programs that benefit Black people benefit them too, the oligarchy will have a serious problem continuing to exploit 99% of the country and the world."

2258,2020-08-18 22:08:42,ic4d13,"I appreciate the articulate reply and glad we can agree about the class issue at least. I'm not sure where you get racist undertones from, my beef is with how the media covers issues like race not black people. As far as your black on black comment, I mean look at the numbers. Black people kill more people than any other race. You would think white people kill more considering they outnumber black people by more than half but that's not the case. So that's the reason it gets covered in the manner you described compared to other races. 

I'm not sure how I'm victim blaming by calling out the fact that the media bias is dividing us. Look, I think there does need to be police reform. I just don't agree with how certain lawmakers want that to happen. If they want to turn bad neighborhoods into absolute nightmares defunding is a good way. 

The reality of the situation is black people aren't the only victims of police brutality, shit I've seen cases where disabled unarmed people got shot up and killed. It makes sense that a minority race that has a higher murder rate per race population is going to have a higher number of police related fatalities. The bigger problem I agree with you are the unarmed fatalities. More native Americans die by police fatality per race population than black people do. Who speaks for them? Why isn't the media talking about that? You know why? Because their numbers aren't going to significantly sway election numbers. I said this a while ago and I stick by it, Malcolm X was right when he said the white liberal is the black persons worst enemy. They will only pretended to care for the cause to get their numbers at the polls. 

It's a giant scam and y'all are falling for it hook line and sinker.

Just to clarify, I didn't mean systemic racism doesn't exist, but when you have a party that directly contributed to that very systemic racism making equality a main talking point then I'd say that's a very overlooked problem. 


I think you have a fair point regarding the difference between the far left and your run of the mill Democrat, unfortunately there's not enough old school Dems around, and the ones that are still around are either bulldogged out of the spotlight or stuck towing the party line to keep their careers."

2273,2020-08-20 12:11:00,ic4d13,"The racist under tone comes from your sarcasm as you pointed out the kill rate of white people and black people. I’ve seen the numbers, it doesn’t justify the way the inherently racist media handles it. 

You are victim blaming because you refused to recognize the struggle of the black community by the police force, and immediately refuted by how many homocides are committed by black people. As if the way they’ve been forced to live or born into doesn’t play a role. 

I’ve already pointed out other races experience police brutality violently, and I’ve already pointed out two sources of evidence that show it disproportionately effects black people. It’d be great to see where you find that natives experience it more than black people. Also, there are higher numbers of cops in black neighborhoods. Don’t you think that over policing plays a role? 

More people everyday are speaking on the indigenous community is it’s suffering. 

Police shouldn’t be killing people at the rate they do. Minorities shouldn’t have to live the way they do. 

It’s not a hook line to speak on the crimes against minorities in this country and advocate for change."
2274,2020-08-19 14:55:52,ic4d13,"I think you should rethink that approach. Correcting a mistake isn’t “covering up your tracks.” You’re essentially willingly leaving an incorrect stat in a post that was otherwise well written and thought out. Just edit it and move on, don’t over think it."

That's not past tense. The Democrats' policies, and Biden's in particular, are currently racist. The ""crime bill"" is racist. The drug war is racist. The wars in the Middle East are racist. The crony capitalism is racist. And so many other things like corporate welfare and for profit medicine are indirectly racist by harming people of color more even though they harm working class white people a whole bunch as well.

These are all bipartisan projects. These two parties that are supposedly so different all support those things. And like you say, that is a very overlooked problem."

2279,2020-08-20 14:23:18,ic4d13,">The racist under tone comes from your sarcasm as you pointed out the kill rate of white people and black people

Discussing statistics is racist now? Data is very important in any debate so I'm not sure why you're trying to paint that picture. When this shit first popped off, anyone that questioned the media's tactics got labeled the way you're trying to label me. Now we have more and more black people taking the same stance I am. They're seeing the bigger picture. A rising post on here is a group of black folks breaking up a BLM protest calling out their hypocrisy. 

I never tried to say black people don't struggle, and I'm not even saying systemic racism doesn't exist. It surely does, but again look at the class of people where that is relevant. 
As a black person yourself do you really want your people stuck in this eternal victim status that liberals not only directly contributed to with bad policy, but use as a tool of vote manipulation?

I 100% agree with your point about WHY black on black violence is substantially higher than other races in this country. It's a sad reality that economic desparity is a direct correlation to these warzone type of neighborhoods. As I stated previously look who runs these places, and has done nothing to fix infrastructure, create jobs, very little community out reach. The police brutality needs to stop, but if you want less paranoid cops on the street we need less people shooting each other up on a daily basis, and that starts by fixing the damn economy in these down trodden cities man. 

You think what you want to think about me, I'm not a racist person I just don't buy the media campaign that happens like clockwork every 4 years. If looking past the BS that gets shoved in our faces and not being a follower makes me a racist so be it. I personally think that's a flawed way of looking at things."
2280,2020-08-19 17:27:25,ic4d13,"I guess that's a good point, I'll update and just leave the edit text in."
2281,2020-08-19 10:46:54,ic4d13,">That's not past tense.

That's debatable. I mean how far back are we talking?  Malcolm X was talking about this stuff in the 70's, specifically how liberals manipulate black people to get their votes. Since we're in r/conspiracy seems to me that all of the people that were in the public eye that truly cared about equality were either killed or de-platformed."
2282,2020-08-20 16:11:38,ic4d13,"Underline where I pointed out the sarcasm in your sentence. 

“According to the left the biggest threat to young black men is the system and police”

“So why is it that white people outnumber black people 6 to 1 yet black people commit over 900 mourners a year more than white people.” 

Which, I can’t find a statistic on the past 2016 anyway. 

The matter is the form you brought your statistic in. It sounds more derogatory than it does helpful and concerning. Especially as you add how black people are more likely to be killed by other black people. Undermining the concern of police brutality. 

I’m not trying to label you as anything, I’m speaking on where I see error"

2362,2020-08-15 14:00:30,ia6qzd,Just speculating there maybe some sort of crossover with Star Trek Discovery
2363,2020-08-19 05:50:38,ia6qzd,Posters and other misc. Mostly black Adam
2364,2020-08-15 19:10:52,ia6qzd,"Yeah, honestly, I'm hoping for some kind of confirmation so badly that I'm seeing things where there is most likely nothing important.
They're probably just lending their voices to some project of some kind."
2365,2020-08-16 22:51:00,ia6qzd,"Interesting. Could he be a race-bend of a JSA character? If so, my bet is Dr. Mid-Nite (Charles McNider was played by a black guy in Legends of Tomorrow)."

2367,2020-08-15 15:28:49,ia6qzd,Geoff's panel is also cancelled
2368,2020-08-15 14:06:57,ia6qzd,"Or their just using the actors, i dont see starvtrek crossing over withanything"
2369,2020-08-16 23:01:11,ia6qzd,Another possibility is Mister Terrific.
2370,2020-08-19 05:52:16,ia6qzd,What about bended wildcat
2371,2020-08-15 16:05:11,ia6qzd,He'll be at stargirl and the three jokers panel I think
2372,2020-08-15 17:23:39,ia6qzd,Link?
2373,2020-08-15 16:06:54,ia6qzd,Oh shit! For real?!
2374,2020-08-16 23:11:33,ia6qzd,Hmm. That's another possibility. I can see it.
2375,2020-08-19 06:14:10,ia6qzd,"That could work too. Arrow had Ted Grant as a Latino man, so it's not like it's never been done before."
2376,2020-08-15 20:27:01,ia6qzd,And if there's any Green Lantern announcement he'll likely be there as he's involved with that series.
2377,2020-08-16 14:23:01,ia6qzd,Its not there in the schedule of dc fandome
2378,2020-08-16 16:21:36,ia6qzd,So no proof then? Like at all...

2381,2020-08-14 18:21:11,i9r2qu,Why? I'd love to hear him in a game!
2382,2020-08-14 18:26:30,i9r2qu,"I think he would have been a decent Baptiste, they would just have to change his story a bit because I doubt Terry Crews can do a carrabean accent like Benz Antonio."
2383,2020-08-14 04:46:26,i9emnj,I don't hate or look into any of the judges. I'm here to see the acts and that's what the show is about. At the end of the day the public votes.
2384,2020-08-14 13:39:24,i9emnj,I agree - to me Terry is a kind-hearted expert host for agt. There's nothing wrong with Heidi -she is a good judge.
2385,2020-08-14 03:55:03,i9emnj,"Terry is terrible, Heidi thinks her hands are binoculars, Howard was the best judge, and Nick was the best host."
2386,2020-08-14 05:27:49,i9emnj,"agreed, I think heidi is the best in terms of judging"
2387,2020-08-14 18:11:17,i9emnj,"Most of her golden buzzers were mediocre, has an atrocious judges’ choice, and is incredibly biased towards singers. She has almost no likings towards instrumentalists, which is my absolute favorite type of act. Stupid model"
2388,2020-08-14 04:02:50,i9emnj,You don’t like terry?! And I’m neutral about Heidi
2389,2020-08-18 04:56:36,i9emnj,"Howard was definitely the best judge, every time they talk about replacing one of them I have a little glimmer of hope :("
2390,2020-08-17 04:05:20,i9emnj,"i think her golden buzzer was fine, and her judges choice is the same as other judges and literally everyone is biased towards singers. how can you say she doesnt like instrumentalists and shes not stupid, according to me shes a great judge"
2391,2020-08-14 04:10:08,i9emnj,"Everything Terry says is a bad line read from a teleprompter. I understand that is how it's done, he's just bad at it. People like TERRY, that makes them think Terry is a good host. I'm fine with Heidi, but people here get triggered when I mention her hand goggles."
2392,2020-08-18 14:03:20,i9emnj,"He absolutely hates Simon, so I doubt there is any chance he will ever come back."
2393,2020-08-17 04:26:19,i9emnj,"This season’s golden buzzer of her’s is one of the very few good golden buzzers she ever had, is what I’m trying to say.

WHAT? Her judges’ choice is the same as other judges? Let me list you all the disastrous judges’ choices she had: voting Chloe Channell over Taylor Williamson (a mediocre kid singer vs. one of the best comedians in AGT history), Miguel Dakota over Emil and Dariel (another mediocre singer vs. great cellists who had impressive rock covers), Yoli Mayor over Just Jerk (and once again, mediocre singer vs. one of the most precise dance crews in AGT), and finally Double Dragon over Feng E (tougher choice but Feng E blows Double Dragon out the water in terms of raw talent). You explain all of that to me. She’s a fucking catastrophe.

She’s always standing up for every solo singer, while never standing up for anyone who just plays an instrument, and it was no different for Brothers Gage, Feng E, and Malik Dope. Heidi never votes instrumentalists through in the judges’ choice either (Emil and Dariel, Brian King Joseph, Feng E) and instead for very average singers for the most part. Easily gets impressed with even the weakest of singers, on top of the fact that every golden buzzer act she had is a singing act (excluding Deadly Games out of the many 7). 

I’ve been there since she joined the judging panel. I’ve witnessed every poor decision she made, and it’s rather excruciating because ultimately, she’s just a model who has no experience in a talent that is meant to entertain."
2394,2020-08-14 04:33:43,i9emnj,"I can agree with the teleprompter thing, and you can tell because when he messes up a line, he knows exactly what to say after it. Nick cannon was good because of how he could be entertaining by being the opposite of Terry. But his excitement and passion about the show is something Nick or any other host never had, which is why he’s my favorite."
2395,2020-08-18 03:24:50,i9emnj,I agree she was a bad judge in the past seasons but she has improved drastically.  now that she got so much experience she has done great this season and if your gonna say shes bad because voted the peru sisters then you must hate sofia and howie just as much.
2396,2020-08-14 05:34:54,i9emnj,"His “enthusiasm” annoys me the most. It comes off as really fake to me. But then again, I’m over this season because as soon as they got into Covid episodes they were ALL over the top excited and positive about everything, even horrible acts. I miss season 1 American Idol Simon."
2397,2020-08-18 03:30:03,i9emnj,"Hmm, I guess I can't deny that Heidi is at her best this season. As for the other two judges, you are correct I despised their decisions as well. Sofia was a complete and utter disappointment when I found out how and why she voted for Double Dragon, and Howie just downright sucked for pulling a 180 on Feng after giving him a standing ovation."
2398,2020-08-14 10:13:40,i9emnj,Terry is overrated tyra was the worse regis was okay jerry springer was actually good but still cannon was the best host to becom for AGT
2399,2020-08-14 18:09:36,i9emnj,"I started watching Howard’s second year, I think. But yeah, Tyra was terrible."
2400,2020-08-12 23:38:48,i8oijg,"""Why is it almost every successful person of color ends up being a republican?""

Wtf are you talking about!!???Jay Z, Beyonce, Dr Dre, Micheal Jordan, Oprah, Rihanna, Dave Chappelle, Kevin Hart, Will Smith, Kendrick Lamar, YG, Common, Ice Cube, LeBron James, Nicki Minaj, Usher and literally countless other successful black celebrities all openly have supported the democratic party or/and what is stands for! This post is pure bullshit."
2401,2020-08-12 23:15:11,i8oijg,Nah
2402,2020-08-12 23:28:29,i8oijg,Gross. No.
2403,2020-08-13 00:07:30,i8oijg,How can you argue that the Democrats are being kept in power when there has been more republican presidents in the past 40 years?
2404,2020-08-12 23:14:50,i8oijg,Yes. You’re right. Clearly he wants his bro Trump to win. He initially delayed running until 2024 and only now is he running to stop Biden.
2405,2020-08-12 23:45:50,i8oijg,Bro ???
2406,2020-08-12 23:24:55,i8oijg,"I'm from the UK so maybe I don't really get a say, but from an outside perspective voting for Trump seems like turkeys voting for Christmas. Trouble is the other choice is just a turkey. We often have a similar choice of turd sandwich or giant douche, so I feel your pain. Sucks to have such shitty choices."
2407,2020-08-12 23:47:48,i8oijg,take this shit down Don Jr’s burner
2408,2020-08-12 23:35:42,i8oijg,[deleted]
2409,2020-08-12 23:45:42,i8oijg,Nah
2410,2020-08-12 23:28:00,i8oijg,"I think Kanye’s thinking is that if the republican party knows they have a chance of winning the black vote then they’ll actually put in effort to fight for the black vote, i.e. by helping their communities and giving them more opportunities. It’s playing the system so that now the black community has 2 parties fighting for it rather than just 1 party who knows no matter what it does, will gain the black vote. It’s sort of like the concept of swing states, except a swing community.

I think it could work, but i ain’t no politics expert"
2411,2020-08-12 23:41:47,i8oijg,And ik y'all going to downvote me because this reddit is just one giant circle jerk but what I'm saying is logical and factual. Kanye makes GREAT music not GREAT decisions.
2412,2020-08-12 23:49:29,i8oijg,"That's because all the ""celebrities"" you named are COWARDS unlike Ye who spits facts and not enslaved by the political system that enriches them as one of the few ""token"" successful minorities. Only Michael Jordan is different from the group cause he understands ""Republicans buy sneakers too"". The other ""celebrities"" can't speak their real feelings cause they worried about losing public support. They all WHORES unlike Ye.

But you from Spain, you wouldn't understand and don't have a say anyway."
2413,2020-08-12 23:43:35,i8oijg,"Finally someone with half a brain who isn't just here to dick ride on Kanye like his word is God. Kanye is not an all around genius, just a musical one."
2414,2020-08-13 00:40:28,i8oijg,"It's not just about the presidency, it's about Congress, governors, mayors, state legislatures, city councils, etc. The DNC has relied on us to vote for them ""automatically"" by keeping us in the ghetto so there would be no need for accountability on their part. What Kanye is 100% correct about is that we need to starting thinking for OURSELVES. Slavery STILL exists in America in 2020 and it's through the political enslavement of the DNC. How many Democrat presidents have we had the past 40 years and how have our situation changed during their terms? Ain't nothing changed since the civil rights movement. We still in the gutter like we were in the 60's, why we still believing the lies?"
2415,2020-08-12 23:53:38,i8oijg,"Suck it up, buttercup. Sometimes you won’t like your vote."
2416,2020-08-13 17:34:22,i8oijg,That’s some grade a mental gymnastics
2417,2020-08-12 23:52:21,i8oijg,🤦‍♂️
2418,2020-08-13 01:33:04,i8oijg,"or they're simply democrats, period

if anything, the cowards would be the republican celebrities who say nothing"
2419,2020-08-12 23:51:16,i8oijg,"Yup. He’s my favorite artist of all time. But he also knows very little about politics, and he lacks the knowledge, experience, and composure to lead a nation through legislation."
2420,2020-08-13 17:33:22,i8oijg,"Man, you are just straight up fucking dumb"
2421,2020-08-13 00:00:12,i8oijg,Yes I am aware. My comment doesn’t contradict that
2422,2020-08-13 17:39:21,i8oijg,tell me what you think then
2423,2020-08-13 05:09:43,i8oijg,"That's my point, a lot of these virtue signaling ""liberals"" are closet Republicans. You think Ellen is actually liberal??? She was caught in a NFL suite sitting next to George W. Bush. You think Jay Z is actually a Democrat??? Or Dr. Dre?!? When these ""celebrities"" start making those millions, last thing they want is to give those millions to the government. And who can blame them? When you from the slums you want to hold ON to your money, not give it to the man to finance the pigs that murder your people. That's why Ye is the ONLY honest celebrity. He sees the TRUTH and is willing to risk it ALL for his BELIEFS unlike most other artists that only care about being popular."
2424,2020-08-12 23:59:42,i8oijg,Agreed.
2425,2020-08-13 00:25:15,i8oijg,Apologies. Have a good night.
2426,2020-08-13 17:42:26,i8oijg,"He’s literally been asked if he’s trying to syphon votes away from Biden for trump and refused to answer. That’s what he’s doing. That’s why he’s having daily conversations with one of the campaigns he’s running against. That’s why a competing campaigns attorney filed his paperwork for him. His only goal is to take votes away from Biden. It’s a bad plan judging from these comments sections since all you stanning for him also say you don’t care about politics and don’t vote apparently but that’s what he is doing. He’s trying to get Trump, the worst president in modern history, re-elected. He’s having a genuine mental breakdown and it’s being exploited by the most racist and hatefilled administration in the last 100 years."
2427,2020-08-13 10:35:54,i8oijg,he's not the only honest celebrity
2428,2020-08-13 17:31:58,i8oijg,Jesus you’re a fucking idiot
2429,2020-08-13 18:27:28,i8oijg,Agreed with everything you said. I’m so fucking tired of everyone making out that Kanye has his own genius agenda when he’s straight up being dumb.
2430,2020-08-13 19:31:02,i8oijg,"you raise good points. I guess we really don’t know and speculation doesn’t do much besides satisfy our own thoughts. honestly I hope kanye has a plan, I know when I plan or try to walk a certain path I may not always be direct in order to preserve my destination, but silence and hidden motives still speak. we are talking politics and shady things definitely happen, so I can’t say you’re wrong. if anything I hope it’s simply kanye trying to set an example of political freedom, but at the same time after having that breakdown I really hope his family is looking after him and making sure he isn’t being exploited by outside sources."
2431,2020-08-14 14:29:29,i8oijg,u/TheJimiBones it's not nice to call someone a fucking idiot - you don't have to agree with him but let's stay polite in discussion.
2432,2020-08-13 18:29:30,i8oijg,He had a stump speech where he proudly stated his “genius”. It was just a creepy manic episode of narcissism.
2433,2020-08-13 18:54:27,i8oijg,Let's see you make a billion dollars. How can Kanye be dumb when he's got more money than Trump? You're dumb for saying Kanye is dumb smh
2434,2020-08-13 19:34:28,i8oijg,I stated this a few weeks ago. His family is going to exploit this for ratings. He truly is in trouble and has no one who doesn’t have an agenda. This all goes back to his mom passing. I believe he still blames himself for that and never got the help he needed so he’ll go anywhere he gets that positive feedback he craves.
2435,2020-08-13 18:48:37,i8oijg,Kanye's not a genius?!?!?!?
2436,2020-08-13 19:32:23,i8oijg,You truly are as dumb as your post makes you seem. Congrats.
2437,2020-08-13 20:22:18,i8oijg,"1) Trump has 2.1 billion in net worth while Kanye has 1.3 billion.

2) Since when does economic wealth count as intelligence? Donald Trump has plenty of money but he inherited most of it from his father. Yes he’s a rich man but the fact that he lost a lot of that money in his own business ventures suggests he’s not as intelligent as he seems.

3) Kanye is a musical genius. There’s no question that he’s responsible for some of the best albums of the past two decades. But just because he’s a musical genius, doesn’t mean he’s qualified to be the President."
2438,2020-08-13 19:47:09,i8oijg,"Kanye definitely is in one hell of a pickle. I really do hope either we’re wrong and he is in control now or at least has family or friends backing him up. We’re just fans so I don’t know if we’ll ever know the full story. but damn man, the idea that his family is manipulating this whole ordeal is such a possibility that it scares me. especially with the tweets about kim/kim’s family recently, but maybe it’s just my overthinking."
2439,2020-08-13 18:49:56,i8oijg,No. He’s absolutely not. Geniuses don’t usually go around telling everyone they’re a genius.
2440,2020-08-13 19:48:32,i8oijg,They solely care about ratings. Ratings translates into increasing their wealth. They’ll ride this out until the end.
2441,2020-08-13 18:55:27,i8oijg,Says who? John Lennon told everyone he's a genius. So did Miles Davis. You don't know anything about artists...wow!
2442,2020-08-13 18:58:20,i8oijg,"Says me, dumbass. You literally asked me. I don’t think John Lennon is a genius. You’ll have to point me to somewhere Miles Davis called himself a genius never heard it and not familiar with him enough to say whether he is or not."
2443,2020-08-13 19:00:47,i8oijg,Who the hell are you? LMAO!
2444,2020-08-13 19:01:23,i8oijg,I’m the guy on the internet who you asked a question of. Are you slow or something?
2445,2020-08-13 19:04:46,i8oijg,"Like I said, who the hell are you LMAO!"
2446,2020-08-13 19:05:23,i8oijg,"So, the answer is you’re slow. Enjoy your evening little buddy."
2447,2020-08-13 19:05:52,i8oijg,"And quit upvoting your own posts with your burner, no one cares LOL"
2448,2020-08-13 19:08:30,i8oijg,"Says the guy on the ""internet"" that doesn't understand the concept of a rhetorical question LMFAO!"
2449,2020-08-13 21:25:23,i8oijg,"Only have one account. And, you, who I accused of being slow, just replied to your own comment. What a beautiful end to this."
2450,2020-08-13 19:09:30,i8oijg,"I think that guy would be you, again, the slow guy."
2451,2020-08-15 21:42:22,i8oijg,"Yeah sure you do LOL! Like I said no one cares, quite being defensive and triggered...WOW!"
2452,2020-08-13 19:10:52,i8oijg,How so? YOU were the one that answered a rhetorical question...WOW!
2453,2020-08-15 21:45:48,i8oijg,You came back to this thread 2 days later. You’re literally the only one who seems to care and the only one who is triggered. You seem to be losing your mind over this a bit. Wouldn’t really expect much less from a Trump supporter though.
2454,2020-08-13 19:28:31,i8oijg,"Do you understand what a rhetorical question is, exactly?"
2455,2020-08-15 21:40:19,i8oijg,Obviously you don't LMAO!

2457,2020-08-12 23:36:06,i8mcjd,"That's great that you learned about it. Whenever you relapse, it's good to look back on why you did it and have a plan for next time.

Also, 12 days is not nothing. Don't think like that. I know you see people on here saying ""Day 90!"" or ""One Year Without Porn!"" but you shouldn't be focusing on high milestones yet. Take it slow, reach a goal that you know that you can reach, such as 20 days, and feel proud of it, and keep moving the goal up higher as you go. If you seek to reach 90 days on day one, then that's not the way to go. Your brain will think that if you reach 30 days, then that is nothing compared to 90 days (since that's your goal), and you won't find the motivation to continue. That leads to a relapse. I'm glad you shared your story, and I hope you continue on the path to victory.

Stay strong brother."
2458,2020-08-12 22:42:53,i8mcjd,"Go for it dude. When you get past 13 days, you'll be on a new kind of roll. And when you get past a month, you'll feel so alive, it's insane. Trust me."
2459,2020-08-13 07:11:01,i8mcjd,Feeling really lonely too after 1-2 weeks. Probably because of lower dopamine level.

2467,2020-08-12 10:58:04,i8bg5t,Beautiful I will cherish this
2468,2020-08-12 13:07:01,i8bg5t,Thank you so much.
2469,2020-08-12 11:00:43,i8bg5t,aww :)
2470,2020-08-12 11:13:05,i8bg5t,He is a great improvement to my sister
2471,2020-08-12 11:21:09,i8bg5t,your sister seems like a sweet girl :)
2472,2020-08-12 12:01:40,i8bg5t,She's okay I suppose.
2473,2020-08-12 12:07:32,i8bg5t,:)
2474,2020-09-14 16:03:34,i8a5f4,Good luck
2475,2020-08-12 08:57:07,i89w7z,Tell her to stop. Tell her it makes you uncomfortable. If she complains... keep telling her.
2476,2020-08-12 09:00:16,i89w7z,You need to talk to her and set boundaries. She's being a dick
2477,2020-08-12 09:40:30,i89w7z,"Answer every single time with something akin to ""no, because I dont have boobs"", really bluntly. Maybe with like an innocently confused tone

""Can't suncreen something I dont have."" ""Can't wiggle something I dont have"" ""It'd be a pretty impressive feat to grab something that doesnt exist""

If you do this and kind of refuse to actually answer her question until she rephrases it, she might learn that if she wants an answer she cant use that word.

Also, I completely agree with other comments suggesting literally talking to her and explaining that it makes you feel like shit, and giving her some other words to use.

If that doesnt work, and my first sugestion doesnt work, just fucking ignore her when she says it. Dont give her any answer, pretend you literally cant hear her until she uses a different word. Or just reply with like ""chest"" until she gives in."
2478,2020-08-12 11:14:12,i89w7z,"Jesus Christ that's making me cringe so hard. Feel bad for you man. She needs to respect all the effort yall went through to masculinize your chest, and even before like it's just uncomfortable. So sorry."
2479,2020-08-12 13:37:34,i89w7z,"Yeah, this is not an accident, she’s deliberately not making an effort. 

It’s like when people make like it’s  sooooo difficult to switch names/pronouns etc. 

A respectful person would not refer to them as boobs even pre-op."
2480,2020-08-12 11:32:43,i89w7z,"Ugh, rude. I have known many people to say 'moobs' or even 'tits' for a guys chest, but you definitely don't do it unless you're * sure* it's ok. Boobs is just *way* too gendered to be thrown around casually like that."
2481,2020-08-12 08:40:52,i89w7z,"Shit, I'd blow up in her face."
2482,2020-08-12 15:19:05,i89w7z,"oh *fuck* no. man, you gotta be straight up, and you gotta be blunt about it. 

my mom had (and is still having) a hard time with gendered stuff. her change from *tía* to *tío* was easiest, since they sound similar, but one thing she couldn’t shake was *mama*

it was out of habit, a very strong habit. and every time she said it, my whole body tensed and i’d feel like shit. she’d ask or say something, and i’d just stay quiet and answer with a gesture, or i’d mutter a late reply

one day i just *couldn’t*. i couldn’t. as soon as we interacted in the morning, i was like, “can you *stop* calling me ‘mama’? like i deadass hate that. i know you don’t mean to, but can you try to pay attention to what you’re saying?”

even though i’m pre-everything, i’m trying to form habits now. as soon as she says anything that’s female-aligned when referring to me, i either correct her or flat out say, “don’t call me that.” and it worked; she catches herself, never messes up with *tío*, and she’s getting better at it. 

it sucks to hear that your mom still does that, even when you’ve gotten far enough to get top surgery. i would’ve snapped by then. props for staying calm, but you definitely gotta say something, and be sure you’re firm in your stance. if you don’t push back, stuff won’t change. good luck man, and congrats on your surgery!

edit: just wanna add that this seems very deliberate. some things are habit, others are conscious. call both things out with your intentions clear to whoever’s slipping up"
2483,2020-08-12 15:30:38,i89w7z,"That is absolutely bizarre behaviour. Your mum is being a total creep and acting like she’s lost touch with reality. Please know that your mum’s behaviour is revolting, and it’s not normal and you don’t deserve it."
2484,2020-08-12 15:51:58,i89w7z,"Every time she says that

""Mom, I think I'll have to schedule you a doctor's appointment to check for dementia if you can't remember me having major surgery...""

And watch her stop"
2485,2020-08-12 14:03:04,i89w7z,You have to communicate this with her.
2486,2020-08-12 13:55:38,i89w7z,"She’s doing this on purpose. Tell her it’s making you uncomfortable and it needs to stop. 


My dad did the same shit when I first came out: every time I said something about him using the wrong pronouns he’d loudly complain to my mum about me “wanting to cut my tits off” despite hating using the word “tits” to describe boobs. He did it because he knew I could hear him."
2487,2020-08-12 21:21:27,i89w7z,"I know people call guys chest ""boobs"" sometimes but all these situations and way your moms saying it is so weird and uncomfortable

Maybe she legit doesnt know a dif word
Chest.. pecs... literally just chest though 

Id be frustrated too"
2488,2020-08-12 13:32:41,i89w7z,You don't even have boobs though. What?
2489,2020-08-12 14:22:54,i89w7z,[deleted]
2490,2020-08-12 14:09:07,i89w7z,"Yep, gonna have to be real direct about it apparently"
2491,2020-08-12 14:00:45,i89w7z,"Too true. It just seems real obvious. It seems like I shouldn’t even need to say anything. Oh, well, hopefully calling her out on it will make it stop"
2492,2020-08-12 15:36:07,i89w7z,"This. Or utter confusion. ""Mom, what boobs? You remember my surgery, right?"""
2493,2020-08-12 13:58:49,i89w7z,Haha I like this plan
2494,2020-08-12 14:01:56,i89w7z,"I know, right? Thanks dude"
2495,2020-08-12 14:05:29,i89w7z,"Yeah, the first one or two times I figured she was just being weird or making a joke that really fell flat or something, then it kept happening. 


And she wondered why I even wanted top and didn’t just accept it since I had a small chest. Well, maybe it’s cause I can’t even go without having “boobs” with a very male chest, so definitely not gonna keep actual boobs on there, lol"
2496,2020-08-12 08:47:25,i89w7z,"I’m trying to keep my cool, but it is getting exceedingly difficult"
2497,2020-08-12 16:06:44,i89w7z,"True. Thanks for the luck! I’m generally non-confrontational, especially with family, but some things you just can’t let go. I gotta put a stop to this shit quick"
2498,2020-08-12 16:04:41,i89w7z,"Thanks, I really appreciate that. It’s hard to be upset with her cause she’s generally a good mom, and sometimes I feel like I’m not giving her enough credit. But some things are just kinda fucked up, and there isn’t an excuse for acting that way"
2499,2020-08-12 16:05:08,i89w7z,Haha might be effective
2500,2020-08-12 14:11:18,i89w7z,"Agreed. Regardless of wether she knows what she is doing or not, it’s happened enough times now that I know she won’t stop unless I’m very clear on the matter"
2501,2020-08-12 13:58:29,i89w7z,"Yeah, I think she is. 

I generally try and give her the benefit of the doubt cause she’s a great mom otherwise, but she has pretty much always dropped casual negatives about my transition. I definitely just need to very explicitly call her out on it"
2502,2020-08-12 14:07:09,i89w7z,"Right? Like dysphoria is a bitch sometimes, but overall I am very happy with my surgery results and muscle improvement. It’s real masculine up in here. No boobs."
2503,2020-08-12 15:10:35,i89w7z,"Pre-op it would have made me pretty self conscious and uncomfortable as a reminder of what's there.

Post-op, nah I dont have a problem with anyone touching my chest, it's totally fine. But I can't really think why someone would? Is it normal to just 'bang your hand' on people's chests..? I've been post op for 4 years and I dont actually think anyone has tried to touch it outside of a sexual context. But I mean, hypothetically I'd be fine with it."
2504,2020-08-12 15:19:20,i89w7z,That’s not at all how consent and personal space work. You DO NOT touch someone without their permission and you most CERTAINLY do not “bang your hand” on someone’s surgery site. DO NOT touch other people’s bodies without consent.
2505,2020-08-12 18:24:54,i89w7z,"In my experience as a cis male, it was difficult for me to come up with new words to replace the ones I shouldn't be using. I could see the people I care about were frustrated by me, but I genuinely had no malicious intentions. I wanted to support them, but I didn't know what else to say. No words came to me. I love them, but it was hard at first to understand what I could do differently to be more supportive.  Maybe your mother is having the same problem. 

Every time she comments about your ""boobs"", rephrase and call them your ""pecs"" so she can get the hang of it. 

""Sorry I bumped into you. Are your boobs, okay?""

""Yes. My pecs are fine.""

Giving me words like this really helped me to find supportive words to use in the future."
2506,2020-08-12 08:52:19,i89w7z,"That admirable of you. I would have done so, the first few times but not after that long."
2507,2020-08-14 01:22:11,i89w7z,"She knows it upsets you and deliberately keeps doing it. You can give her credit for the things she does right, while also knowing and telling her that THIS behaviour is intentionally  cruel and awful, and you don’t deserve it."
2508,2020-08-12 23:19:37,i89w7z,That’s it; just call her out and make her feel bad for pulling this shit.
2509,2020-08-12 14:13:36,i89w7z,Why is your mom like this?
2510,2020-08-12 18:03:52,i89w7z,[deleted]
2511,2020-08-12 19:52:49,i89w7z,"Thanks for the perspective, I’ll try that"
2512,2020-08-12 14:16:20,i89w7z,"Who knows? Secretly a lot of transphobia, but she is trying to care for her child? Feeling sad that she doesn’t have a daughter and just really attached to the idea that she has someone to talk to about boobs? She’s actually a comedian and this is a long-con hidden camera tv show?"
2513,2020-08-12 20:34:49,i89w7z,"Absolutely not true. I agree it can be natural for guys to touch without permission as in a slap on the shoulder when saying hey or when making a joke etc. But it's also perfectly common to tell a guy you dont like that and have them respect you and stop doing it.

Some guys are dicks sure, including you by the sound of it if you think 'guys dont get that option' of being able to tell friends to stop doing shit that makes them uncomfortable, but guys that respect their friend's boundaries exist. I've never had to tell a guy friend to back off doing something like that, but if I did and they took the piss out of it they would not be my friend anymore, which isn't a problem as I have many guys friends who would literally just say ""oh my bad man, no worries"". Get some better friends maybe."
2514,2020-08-12 20:01:31,i89w7z,"Wishing you luck, bud."
2515,2020-08-12 03:08:45,i81d94,"I mean, as far as I could see, there was a battle of the wits, but Agatha had won the war. She played the game in a very controlling manner and put herself in a great spot with everyone left at the final 4, on top of being a huge threat. She very likely wins the season in a landslide if the top 4 vote was a regular vote, but alas it is not, so sadly Agatha is ROBBED and instead the Banana wins. Still, despite the tragic pre merge, it was a decent season."
2516,2020-08-12 03:14:35,i81d94,If you don't think Agatha and Walter are gonna show up to an all star season if I did one there is something wrong with you.
2517,2020-08-11 21:10:20,i80537,"I don't care that guys use them, I just wish they'd be more open.

Your limits naturally are very dissapointing for many dudes because of celebrities and actors. You're never gonna look like them unless you take HGH"
2518,2020-08-11 21:08:49,i80537,what about ricardo milos's physique?is it possible to reach that much sexiness naturally?
2519,2020-08-11 21:08:54,i80537,Big fax. Most if not all celebrity bods have come through some sort of surgery or steroids
2520,2020-08-11 23:02:39,i80537,Women talk about unrealistic body standards (which is legitimate sometimes) but some body standards for men are actually impossible without medical modification. They are literally outside of what is possible in nature.
2521,2020-08-12 02:51:40,i80537,"Kumail Nanjiani is a perfect example of this - he got jacked and flat out said he couldn't do it without a year of the best trainers, nutritionists, and being paid by a studio to do it full time. Its doable without steroids but takes more than the average person can do."
2522,2020-08-11 23:46:10,i80537,"I disagree check out my last Instagram post (TopRanked_Frank) Iv been told I take steroids when I don’t. Also accused of photoshop so I had to post the unedited photo as a comment on Facebook (edited to make it look like I had wolverine claws and not be in the bathroom) 

These types of bodies are obtainable easier based on genetics, but it’s pretty possible if you 

don’t eat/drink sugar 
Cut out carbs
Take creatine 
Take/eat enough protein 
Take caffeine 
Workout hard as fuck daily (maybe 1 or 2 days off a week) 

Optional: take ephedrine 
Optional: Take other supplements like betaine"
2523,2020-08-11 21:22:49,i80537,"I don't know what kind of movies you watch but guys like George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Jake Gyllenhaal, Leonardo diCaprio, Tom Cruise, Johnny Depp, Christian Bale or Pierce Brosnan who have all at one point been called sex symbols most definitely don't use any steroids.

Literally the only two actors I can think of at the top of my head who may have taken steroids are Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone and I don't actually know if they did."
2524,2020-08-11 22:01:37,i80537,"For years, bodybuilders who were obviously on juice have been claiming to be all natural.

There's a video interview from the 1980s of a certain contest winner going on an on about how anabolic steroids are the worst thing that have happened to bodybuilding, and how guys getting into bodybuilding should absolutely steer clear of steroids. But he himself doesn't look very natural."
2525,2020-08-11 23:57:45,i80537,You should watch Greg Doucette's Natty or not youtube videos.  Hilarious and entertaining AF.
2526,2020-08-12 01:17:04,i80537,So??
2527,2020-08-12 01:26:32,i80537,Not unpopular.
2528,2020-08-12 01:28:47,i80537,"What about athletes? Have you seen the physique of some those NFL players, how can you look that ripped/huge and be in your early twenties. I’m sure it’s natural because there is a no drug stance with the NFL."
2529,2020-08-12 01:32:40,i80537,It’s all about genetics. Some people get the good stuff and some don’t
2530,2020-08-12 03:12:31,i80537,"No. They can be like Arnolds but it's more about eating right, low body fat and working out a lot. Plenty of guys out there get ripped with food and exercise. Most of us just aren't willing or able to do so. They've also got some genes on their side."
2531,2020-08-12 03:24:20,i80537,Sadly a lot of it is done by forcing the poor guys to work out like Olympians and then simultaneously dehydrate their asses off leading up to certain scenes. Hugh Jackman did that kinda thing. I think he mentioned he was gonna pass out while filming The Wolverine or something
2532,2020-08-12 03:43:02,i80537,This is so bullshit? Women may “swoon” or whatever over jacked actors and movie stars but its not the standard or what women actually realistically want or expect. Same goes for when men “swoon” over actresses with huge breasts and tiny waists. We know its not realistic. We know its plastic surgery 99% of the time. Yes you can be attracted to people unattainable body types but still be realistic in what your standards are for your S.O.
2533,2020-08-12 05:08:32,i80537,"they take steroids because they need to get jack in a short period of time. its possible for a guy to get jacked like that the old natural way but it will takes months and maybe years. its still possible. they also stay dehydrated while on set so muscles stick out.

all you have to do is tell guys they can get jacked but it will take time and they won't look shredded 24/7 because drinking water will add water weight. but saying they're look in unattainable is too broad and defeatist."
2534,2020-08-12 06:53:22,i80537,"I really don't know much about the male body industry but I'm sure you're right. I just think it's obvious that people have different body types, just like women do. That means for some it is attainable and for some, it simply isn't. It doesn't mean it's unrealistic, it's just not realistic for everyone. But I agree with you, that there needs to be more honesty about it."
2535,2020-08-12 06:58:58,i80537,"It’s actually mostly testosterone supplements now, not many people actually use steroids now. And I think you’re only half right. It’s achievable, it just requires you to really dedicate yourself, you have to really really want it and work out literally every day, diet is just as important though."
2536,2020-08-12 09:26:17,i80537,You know how you like looking at a Masarati but you don’t really *need* one in your house? I mean it’d be nice and all but not really practical for your life when a nice certified pre-owned midsize SUV with a reasonable payment plan will make you much happier. That’s more like what women think about these celebrity bods. Just relax man. We don’t expect you to look like Christian Bale Lol.
2537,2020-08-12 10:36:46,i80537,"Well not everyone can do it with steroids. Some people are just ""better"" For about 3 years in my 20's I was what might be called ""ripped"" not huge, but maybe like Bruce Lee level muscles. And I was MISERABLE most of the time. It can be done, but it's a full time job and you are always hungry and thirsty."
2538,2020-08-13 19:13:07,i80537,"I take steroids. Trained 10 years without them. I looked better natty than most gym bro’s do on steroids. 

Genetics is more important than steroids but they’re both needed to achieve an insane physique"
2539,2020-08-13 20:32:02,i80537,Steroids are as common as lip fillers for women. That sub is toxic btw they think anyone over 180lbs is juicy
2540,2020-08-11 21:16:59,i80537,"What about women? What you see on TV is also unattainable without unlimited time for work-outs and plenty of sleep, and also a decent budget for anti-aging treatments, massages, salons and expensive clothing. Let’s be real, you can look good in a trash bag when you’re 21 (roughly) and I still look decent in my early 30’s. But I can assure you that an extra million in my bank account would be as effective as the fountain of youth."
2541,2020-08-11 21:21:26,i80537,"No matter how long you've been training for, there's a certain limit that you simply cannot pass naturally (even with steroids, the limit is still there, it's just much higher). That said, i agree with your point, it's well known that most (possibly even all) professional athletes use steroids, all those hollywood actors that get in shape for a role within like 8 weeks use them, the majority of dudes you see on instagram and social media use them. Personally i'm not against them, i just want people to be more open and honest."
2542,2020-08-11 22:11:55,i80537,"they could be just using protein supplement, you know. I don't think these men would rather get a certain physique at the cost of their penis not working. yes, juicing will most likely lead to erectile dysfunction."
2543,2020-08-11 23:43:00,i80537,Different genetics have different natural limits to muscle growth.  Just luck.  Most of us could be looking a lot better than we do with some effort.  Not like Arnold S. but I doubt all or (even most) actors are juicing.   It is their job to look a certain way for certain roles.  I have been noticing pretty spindly arms on a lot of popular male actors these days.  I just mentioned it the other day to my husband.  Cute face but those arms could pick up a barbell.  I like strong arms 🤷🏻‍♀️
2544,2020-08-11 21:09:50,i80537,"How do you know cris Evan and hemsworth are on drugs? I dare you to say that to their face. You clearly don’t know that they hire professional coaches that guide them through the process. What about aamir khan and hrithik roshan? Ever heard of them? Yes, Arnold took steroids in the past, but they were legal at that time. Terry crews has probably been working out before you came out of your mothers womb. Yet you have the audacity to call him out. Guess wahlberg is also on drugs."
2545,2020-08-11 21:40:28,i80537,I don’t like overly muscley guys.

2549,2020-08-12 20:03:48,i80537,Actors are getting paid to work out that's why it's attainable like you said. But some people like Chris Hemsworth seem they've done steroids.
2550,2020-08-12 00:06:47,i80537,"My guy, you certainly don't look like you juice. Maybe to someone who has absolutely no clue about bodybuilding, but your physique screams natural to me. I'm not saying you look bad, but nothing about your body seems off to me."
2551,2020-09-03 22:46:18,i80537,"As someone who takes steroids, you look nothing like someone who takes steroids"
2552,2020-08-11 21:33:35,i80537,"Jake Gyllenhall definitely juiced up for Southpaw. Christian Bale did as well, for the Batman movies and American Psycho. As for the others on your list, they probably didn't, but they never played characters that were supposed to look huge and muscular."
2553,2020-08-11 21:25:20,i80537,"Christian Bale most definitely uses steroids. The rest of those guys probably have more time to bulk up for roles but there’s no possible way Christian bale and drop and lose weight like that so much without some drug. And I honestly can’t tell if you’re joking with Arnold and Stallone. Arnold has legitimately said he’s done them, on camera. And Stallone had a build that just isn’t possible without steroids. You can’t be that huge and cut at the same time."

2556,2020-08-12 02:17:27,i80537,"From my observation, the general standard for women is 'don't be fat'. If you aren't fat, 80-90% of men will think you're fine. Large boobs/small boobs? Doesn't matter if she isn't fat. Big ass/small ass? Again, doesn't matter if she isn't fat. 

I get that women *feel* obligated by society to keep up with some realistic image, but in truth they just need to have a BMI <25. 

That is in no way comparable to the fact that, as a man, 'not being fat' is not enough. If you want to be seen as attractive, you essentially *have* to put in physical exercise. Simply cutting calories is not enough."
2557,2020-08-11 23:40:48,i80537,"That is certainly not true, juicing CAN lead to ED or a number of other side effects, but when done properly it's most likely not going to cause any significant damage to your body. Also, what do protein supplements have to do with this?"

2559,2020-08-12 00:04:34,i80537,"You just defeated your own point, it's their job to look a certain way, so why wouldn't they juice? If done correctly, it's safe, with no noticeable side effects, so there's basically no risk involved."
2560,2020-08-11 21:14:23,i80537,I truly hope that you're joking.
2561,2020-08-11 23:08:02,i80537,"Wahlberg is definitely on drugs, maybe not steroids though"
2562,2020-08-12 03:38:46,i80537,Literally have never met a woman in my life that wants a ripped overly muscular dude.
2563,2020-08-12 11:32:06,i80537,Not true dude
2564,2020-08-11 21:12:48,i80537,thanks man.now i know no mere mortal can reach him.
2565,2020-08-11 21:42:30,i80537,A bit too muscley.
2566,2020-08-13 19:12:25,i80537,Why you citing that sub like it’s gospel?
2567,2020-08-12 01:59:00,i80537,I usually only deal with other actors/ casting directors and they sometimes ask if I use anything lol.
2568,2020-08-12 01:17:20,i80537,""" You can’t be that huge and cut at the same time. ""

Let me introduce you to this:

2569,2020-08-12 10:33:11,i80537,">Right, cause you know how much they hit the gym while you sit on your fat ass"
2570,2020-08-12 01:02:21,i80537,"Yes, you just named people who are in sports for a living. We’re talking about average working people. A working mother of two, for example, would not find the time nor the energy to go on daily runs. I don’t think this example is that extreme."
2571,2020-08-11 22:44:05,i80537,"well theres a possibility atleast, i guess"
2572,2020-08-12 00:08:08,i80537,"Yah, I guess I did a little, but I haven’t noticed that many men on TV that look like they are juicing besides the obvious.   They look pretty skinny to me these days.   Too skinny."
2573,2020-08-11 21:41:10,i80537,What does that mean? I like Jack. Can I have him?
2574,2020-08-11 21:49:31,i80537,Can I have him or are they going to try force little boy penis on me to make me a pedo? Icky.
2575,2020-08-11 23:14:26,i80537,What exactly does your brain fail to understand?
2576,2020-08-12 02:45:05,i80537,"No Homo, but I thought you looked pretty good! 

Brad Pitt from fight club vibe, keep up the good work!"
2577,2020-08-12 11:42:47,i80537,I actually work out every day except Sundays. Sounds like some projection to me.
2578,2020-08-12 23:00:40,i80537,No... I didnt. Lol. How could you even gather that from what I said? How many girls at a regional crossfit comp do you think is getting paid? Not a lot to answer the question. Most bikini and fitness competitors- also have day jobs. Only the elite get paid enough to survive off of that alone.
2579,2020-08-11 23:36:50,i80537,It fails to understand how could someone be so stupid
2580,2020-08-12 03:20:46,i80537,Lol thanks bro
2581,2020-08-12 12:09:40,i80537,"You’re purposely not reading my comments and just commenting one line replies, so I’m doing the same"
2582,2020-08-11 23:53:29,i80537,How exactly do you know that terry takes drugs? You don’t realize how long he has been working out do you? It’s common to hate on something you can’t achieve and blame it on something else. I guess every single wrestler in the WWE also takes drugs
2583,2020-08-12 12:14:34,i80537,Translation: my adhom didn't work so I'm going to quit and pretend I won. You also don't know how steroids work if you think accusing someone of not working out is a signifier of steroid use. Good luck with your head in the sand buddy
2584,2020-08-12 00:01:39,i80537,"Ah shit here we go again. I absolutely adore Terry Crews, i think he's a great human being. However, there is zero chance he's natural. Your point that he's been working out for decades is unimportant, at some point you reach a natural limit of how much muscle you can put on and then that's it, there's no further gains to be made. Every person is different, but let's be generous and say that with proper training and diet, you reach your natural potential after 10 years. In the first year you'll gain the most muscle, then next year it's gonna be less, and then every year after than you'll put on less and less muscle mass. Now, let's factor in the fact that testosterone production decreases drastically for men over 40, and their body produces less and less testosterone the older they get. Terry is 52. These days the absolute minimum he does is TRT. As for WWE wrestlers, i have no clue, but i'd say the majority of them do yes."
2585,2020-08-12 12:28:14,i80537,"You didn’t say anything about my response to terry, where I said that he’s maintaining and not growing. I’m pretty sure steroid use is clearly visible, it has side affects. Just because someone grew muscle in a short amount of time I guess it’s all drugs to you. I bet literally anyone who has a fitness ig page with over 100k followers is juiced according to you"
2586,2020-08-12 00:24:45,i80537,"Terry hasn’t gained muscle in a while, he’s just been maintaining it. He doesn’t train for strength anymore. And training for decades is important, cause the common belief is that if someone achieves an impressive physique in a short amount of time, then we can question its integrity. You do realize that WWE has routine tests, as do many other programs like UFC, in which if you are caught doping it is made public. It’s hard to avoid those tests since the drugs will still be in your system. Again, terry is not gaining any muscle he is maintaining it. You still seem to have doubts. If you have any interest in education yourself and not believing what is the norm apparently, search up aamir khan transformation"
2587,2020-08-12 00:35:03,i80537,"As for WWE, i can't say too much since i don't follow it at all. 

The UFC however, i do know a thing or two about. Since USADA came, they started catching more and more people, and suddenly some of the freakiest guys there started melting in the span of a few years. Vitor Belfort, Overeem, Erick Silva, Johny Hendricks...their physiques melted after they actually started testing properly. None of them were ""caught"" as far as i know, but they obviously hopped off whatever they were on. 

Once again, if you truly believe Terry Crews is natural, i really can't help you dude, keep believing the lies they tell. All those 8 week, 12 week, 3 month transformations that those actors go through (i'm not talking about Crews here) are complete bullshit. I won't even go into the bullshit that's spread on social media, where the biggest fitness influencers are fake nattys who earn their money by selling lies to their followers. It's a disgusting practice, and i'm sick and tired of it."
2588,2020-08-12 01:07:39,i80537,"Forget fitness influencers, but you have to realize that these actors don't work with regular people or random gym trainers. These guys work with some of the best in their field, which really know what they are doing. They have specific workouts designed for them for maximum output. I bet you even think kumail nanjiani transformation was bs. Okay so you caught a couple of UFC mishaps, that still leaves more than 75% of them clean, but nobody ever focuses on that. One drug catch directly means everyone is bad.

Nobody is telling me Terry Crews is natural, but I have eyes. Drug use is extremely easy to see, especially steroid use as pimples, excessive trap size, etc. 

Dude. 8 weeks is 2 months. If you exercise 5 days a week, which sometimes these actors have to do, for at least 1 hour a day, with eating right, you'd be surprised what you can do with your body. Not saying you can go from scrawny to fit, but you can still put on decent size.

But honestly man there are bigger larger than Terry Crews who are still natty, and if you can't understand the fact that Terry has been lifting longer than your entire life, then I can't help you."
2589,2020-08-12 01:11:46,i80537,The amount of delusion in this comment is staggering
2590,2020-08-12 07:48:48,i80537,The only natties bigger than Terry Crews are obese.
2591,2020-08-12 02:07:24,i80537,I expect nothing less from you when you can’t think of a logical comeback
2592,2020-08-12 01:52:43,i7ukj0,"You know, if Brett won this season, I wouldn't be mad at all."

also reminder that sofia’s an actress. her “screwing up the routine” is part of the routine. they play off each other well."
2597,2020-08-12 01:50:55,i7ukj0,realistically he probably shouldn’t have made that last simon joke but i love it😂
2598,2020-08-12 01:49:49,i7ukj0,Fuck it. Brett has to win this season

2602,2020-08-12 01:10:08,i7ukj0,"Bello Nock is the iconic danger act, right next to Deadly Games, and Annaliese did her father proud."
2603,2020-08-12 01:13:14,i7ukj0,i’ll say this... whoever designed these stage set-ups really brought it.
2604,2020-08-12 01:36:34,i7ukj0,Was I the only one who thought the double dragons were good?

2611,2020-08-12 01:12:13,i7ukj0,Ok the staging tonight is next level. Can NBC use this for the voice for here on out?
2612,2020-08-12 01:47:53,i7ukj0,Best act of the night!
2613,2020-08-12 01:48:50,i7ukj0,I love him! His personality makes him great above and beyond for me.
2614,2020-08-12 01:02:51,i7ukj0,This is the best act tonight. 10 votes for the Nocks
2615,2020-08-12 01:04:17,i7ukj0,"That was an awesome performance! I love how we were warned not to do that one at home, I wouldn’t even know how to go about getting that huge wheel!"
2616,2020-08-12 01:02:28,i7ukj0,They added fire! Simon would have enjoyed this

2621,2020-08-12 01:24:23,i7ukj0,is this a comedian or a youth pastor
2622,2020-08-12 01:51:46,i7ukj0,OH FUCK I JUST GOT THE BIKE SENTENCE. LMAOOOOO
2623,2020-08-12 01:56:42,i7ukj0,I’d watch Brett and Sofia in a sitcom/reality show/movie/ANYTHING together.
2624,2020-08-12 00:22:01,i7ukj0,ngl hearing sofia say “ukaleelee” made me forget now its actually pronounced

2629,2020-08-12 01:56:23,i7ukj0,He's really riding with this story.
2630,2020-08-12 01:59:50,i7ukj0,"I love during the magic you could hear kelly reacting in the background. It was probably genuine, but it definitely adds to it since the audience is virtual"
2631,2020-08-12 00:11:26,i7ukj0,dang I like this format... We don't see the audience and get to see the WHOLE act without cuts to anyone.
2632,2020-08-12 01:14:22,i7ukj0,That was a boring song choice
2633,2020-08-12 01:18:16,i7ukj0,"Aw, jeez, the first of the COVID sob stories.

Edit: Or second?  I don’t even know."
2634,2020-08-12 01:25:07,i7ukj0,I am not feeling this comedy set. It's a little too heartfelt. More like a comedic sermon than an actual comedy set.
2635,2020-08-12 01:48:34,i7ukj0,OMG! How did he do that  there?
2636,2020-08-12 01:50:19,i7ukj0,Lmao at the falling off a bicycle comment!
2637,2020-08-13 00:05:18,i7ukj0,Michael yo is not funny at all. Don't know how he made it this far
2638,2020-08-12 02:00:48,i7ukj0,i like kelly clarkson as a judge
2639,2020-08-12 00:43:12,i7ukj0,I don’t think it was a good idea to ditch the salsa songs. It kind of ruined the point of it being a *salsa* duo
2640,2020-08-12 00:50:49,i7ukj0,prob one of the best sets ive seen on this show...
2641,2020-08-12 00:51:46,i7ukj0,"Well, here's hoping he can get hired as a Flash villain or something like the last contortionist."
2642,2020-08-12 01:09:08,i7ukj0,This act needs to be in the live shows. It was so entertaining and true talent
2643,2020-08-12 01:15:21,i7ukj0,"The background looks like something out of a video game with top-notch graphics. Her high vocals in the song are pretty good, but in the parts when she sang lower, it was very underwhelming"
2644,2020-08-12 01:24:01,i7ukj0,This isn’t comedy....... it’s just commentary without the jokes
2645,2020-08-12 01:28:46,i7ukj0,"This whole season has been of the worst ever. I thought the live shows would be better, but meh."
2646,2020-08-12 01:29:30,i7ukj0,I've laughed more at Howie's boomer jokes than this
2647,2020-08-12 01:34:22,i7ukj0,Latino Heat 🔥🔥
2648,2020-08-12 01:42:41,i7ukj0,Brendon urie's up next
2649,2020-08-12 01:48:59,i7ukj0,Best of the night!
2650,2020-08-12 10:08:49,i7ukj0,Surprised that guy is still on the show after someone posted that video of what he said to that woman. Wtffffff...That was super weird and I don't think that's something you could discuss.
2651,2020-08-12 00:33:35,i7ukj0,I'm really liking Kelly Clarkson. Can we keep her?
2652,2020-08-12 00:14:47,i7ukj0,I like how nobody booed Howie for his opinion
2653,2020-08-12 00:31:12,i7ukj0,She still hasn’t topped her first performance tbh
2654,2020-08-12 00:32:41,i7ukj0,Finally someone actually judging singers
2655,2020-08-12 00:42:21,i7ukj0,What a joke. Do you guys even know how MASSIVE the talent gap is between Simon and Maria and D’Angelo and Amanda (from Season 8)?
2656,2020-08-12 00:54:12,i7ukj0,"How come we have a lot of acts this season that are similar to other acts from previous seasons, but downgraded?"
2657,2020-08-12 00:59:36,i7ukj0,"Wheel of Death, third time lucky?"
2658,2020-08-12 01:03:15,i7ukj0,10! A+++
2659,2020-08-12 01:16:54,i7ukj0,I wasn’t expecting this wtf
2660,2020-08-12 01:25:17,i7ukj0,The zoom calls are just looped videos of people cheering
2661,2020-08-12 01:52:00,i7ukj0,Would love to see a show with Bonavega and Loudermilk together
2662,2020-08-12 01:04:26,i7ukj0,America better not rob these 2 again
2663,2020-08-12 01:29:12,i7ukj0,Also can we keep Kelly. She is an incredibly accurate judge and vibes really well with Howie.
2664,2020-08-12 01:50:13,i7ukj0,“Are you gonna fall off a bike anytime soon?”
2665,2020-08-12 02:01:09,i7ukj0,"Okay guys. His story is incredibly moving, but I just wish his singing was the same. Not the worst, but not the best singer either."
2666,2020-08-12 01:51:18,i7ukj0,I loved the interactions between Sofia and him. Hope he makes it through.
2667,2020-08-12 01:16:37,i7ukj0,Michael Yo explains his COVID story on the Joe Rogan podcast if anybody is interested in hearing more.
2668,2020-08-12 01:48:47,i7ukj0,I love Brett’s personality
2669,2020-08-12 00:08:19,i7ukj0,"Cute and family-friendly act, but not a million dollar contender. 

This is State Fair entertainment, at best."
2670,2020-08-12 00:11:28,i7ukj0,"I chuckled to be honest. They won’t make it through (and probably shouldn’t) but it was enjoyable to me. I’m glad I didn’t have pork chops for dinner tonight, I would’ve felt bad."
2671,2020-08-12 00:15:42,i7ukj0,"Well, it’s that time of year again when I re-download the AGT app."
2672,2020-08-12 00:22:08,i7ukj0,"The fun thing about these different sets is that we get some indication of what their Vegas show would look like for each of them. With that background, it actually looked like a Vegas show."
2673,2020-08-12 00:28:10,i7ukj0,can someone from the live audience share a screenshot of what their pov looks like?
2674,2020-08-12 00:42:39,i7ukj0,"I like these two but the act was about a 5, for me.

That set was a freaking 10 though.

Is it weird if I don't mind this being the format, moving forward? Even if it's just for Judge Cuts. I'm just loving the variation with the different sets."
2675,2020-08-12 00:48:16,i7ukj0,The call was 100% staged
2676,2020-08-12 01:01:45,i7ukj0,Oh God oh God no
2677,2020-08-12 01:03:22,i7ukj0,THAT WAS SICK!! This better not lose again.
2678,2020-08-12 01:12:06,i7ukj0,The stage looks really cool!

2684,2020-08-12 01:17:38,i7ukj0,"Aww, Michael Yo! I’m glad he survived COVID."
2685,2020-08-12 01:31:48,i7ukj0,This looks like the intro to a porno.

2710,2020-08-12 01:26:41,i7ukj0,So far the Nocks were the only good act and they probably won’t advance since America hates danger acts

But I will say this: giving them the first performance slot tonight highlights how well this remote format can work.  The staging is so much better like this than it would be on the actual stage, and it feels much more natural."

2823,2020-08-12 22:46:05,i7ukj0,"This one isn't the most difficult of nights

Roberta's voice is insane and I think with Kelly on, it really solidified her spot.

Archie's got the audience by the palm of his hands with his story, and the song choice was insanely perfect and emotionally powerful.

At least that's my top 2, and I really don't like singer acts that much.

From there:
Bello and Annaliese - at 1st I thought the injury was fake, then seeing him on the stage I had to rethink that thought.  It was a good act with just the right amount of almost messing up to make it look even more dangerous.

Feng E - is an insanely gifted ukelele player and was spectacular.

Next tier:

Frenchie Baby - gotta be honest, I didn't watch it, contortion just isn't my think, fast forward thru it but from the comments, it was good.  But lets face it, contortion is a hit or miss art form.

Brett Loudermilk - his act is just weird, it works too but I'm not sure how.  I like it but I'm not sure why.

Michael Yo - comedy is going to hard to get thru.  It's so difficult without an audience.  Further, it typically requires an audience and multiple shows to work thru bits, and during this pandemic time, if he gets thru, it's going to be difficult to move further.

Bottom tier:

Double Dragon - likeable, good singers but likely the end of the road here.  But when compared to Roberta and Archie, I can't see them moving forward.

Simon and Maria - decent kid dancers, but they probably shouldn't have moved forward from the judge cuts.

Shquira - she was pitchy, missed a lot of notes.  Can't see her moving forward.

Pigs - Howie said it, it's like dogs but slower.  The rephrase, it's boring."
2824,2020-08-12 01:55:40,i7ukj0,Didn’t this guy get exposed for being creepy or something
2825,2020-08-12 01:13:19,i7ukj0,Roberta is boring me with this song choice.
2826,2020-08-12 01:33:58,i7ukj0,This is painfully bad
2827,2020-08-12 01:35:11,i7ukj0,"Got to admit, Double Dragon's act here, was lower than their audition act."
2828,2020-08-12 00:50:30,i7ukj0,It would be better if the camera wasn’t so far...and if he didn’t blend in too much with his surroundings.
2829,2020-08-12 01:13:58,i7ukj0,That girls voice at 10 is incredible.
2830,2020-08-12 01:14:50,i7ukj0,"Roberta really is a very good singer, or at least has the potential to be. But when you put a song in that key, where you're sacrificing the verses to really soar for the chorus, then you gotta SOAR. And I just wasn't feeling it."

2839,2020-08-12 00:39:01,i7ukj0,That might be the most annoying pre performance clip that I’ve ever watched. What the hell is going on tonight?
2840,2020-08-12 00:46:47,i7ukj0,yeah no way that was a live performance... the diner is so far from the studio. It would've took 15 minutes or so to get down there.
2841,2020-08-12 01:03:47,i7ukj0,Annaliese had her father even scared there.
2842,2020-08-12 01:08:52,i7ukj0,"Show: *portions of the act prerecorded*

Terry: We filmed this a day when Kelly couldn’t be here."
2843,2020-08-12 01:12:35,i7ukj0,You Say has been #1 in the Christian chart for 90+ weeks we don’t have to promote it even more
2844,2020-08-12 01:13:43,i7ukj0,Another fantastic performance from Roberta there!
2845,2020-08-12 01:16:52,i7ukj0,Michael Yo's turn to try to make us laugh.
2846,2020-08-12 01:24:47,i7ukj0,BOOOOOOOOO
2847,2020-08-12 01:35:47,i7ukj0,"That was their best act so far, by far and I still think it’s a toss up between them and Michael for who’s the worst so far."
2848,2020-08-12 01:41:28,i7ukj0,Brett's turn!
2849,2020-08-12 01:44:32,i7ukj0,Sophia and Heidi are in pantsuits! Love it.
2850,2020-08-12 01:52:02,i7ukj0,Ok I’ll check out Project Power. I’m intrigued.
2851,2020-08-12 01:12:23,i7ukj0,"Roberta is a super talented singer, but also not a great Golden Buzzer."
2852,2020-08-12 01:14:56,i7ukj0,Oh she better not win
2853,2020-08-12 01:58:44,i7ukj0,This song is kindof a snooze but it’s got a good message.
2854,2020-08-12 02:00:09,i7ukj0,craziest story this shows ever had but if we’re basing it on talent alone... i dunno
2855,2020-08-11 16:22:02,i7ukj0,Anyone have any idea what the set looks like?
2856,2020-08-11 17:36:37,i7ukj0,Do we know how this is being done? Are the acts on zoom or in person?
2857,2020-08-12 00:05:26,i7ukj0,Oh no. The pig act is up first.
2858,2020-08-12 00:06:39,i7ukj0,These guys got through? I can’t wait to see how many times I get to have reaction.
2859,2020-08-12 00:09:19,i7ukj0,i'm here for the piggy!
2860,2020-08-12 00:10:09,i7ukj0,"It's definitely interesting and unique, but up against dog acts that do the same thing I don't think they'll make it alot further"
2861,2020-08-12 00:12:01,i7ukj0,"They were good but not really Vegas worthy. Now Branson or Pigeon Forge on the other hand, that's where they'll make bank!"
2862,2020-08-12 00:15:09,i7ukj0,Heidi and howie are talking about how much of a bore it was yet no buzzers
2863,2020-08-12 00:18:19,i7ukj0,Who the hell is Feng G? I don't remember him.
2864,2020-08-12 00:18:41,i7ukj0,thats a cool set
2865,2020-08-12 00:18:48,i7ukj0,This is going super well
2866,2020-08-12 00:30:18,i7ukj0,LOL You could Get Swine Flu!
2867,2020-08-12 00:30:33,i7ukj0,🥱
2868,2020-08-12 00:41:12,i7ukj0,I’m feeling a light to decent 7
2869,2020-08-12 00:41:47,i7ukj0,I miss the Jaws ride
2870,2020-08-12 00:46:36,i7ukj0,Is this actually live? It doesn’t say live in the corner
2871,2020-08-12 00:46:40,i7ukj0,Howie here again reminding us how many acts are going through
2872,2020-08-12 00:47:26,i7ukj0,"Turf 2.0, let’s do this thing."
2873,2020-08-12 00:49:01,i7ukj0,Oh hi Turf
2874,2020-08-12 00:54:35,i7ukj0,"Spotifying the song from this Dunkin ad was my biggest mistake, because it's been stuck in my head for close to a month now."
2875,2020-08-12 01:00:20,i7ukj0,i guess bellos post is from yesterday but just telling us now.
2876,2020-08-12 01:01:54,i7ukj0,AGT bout to have their 1st casualty...
2877,2020-08-12 01:12:26,i7ukj0,So who gets the pimp spot?
2878,2020-08-12 01:24:37,i7ukj0,Ouch
2879,2020-08-12 01:24:42,i7ukj0,"I've never heard him before, he's ehhh so far"
2880,2020-08-12 01:25:22,i7ukj0,i liked his audition better
2881,2020-08-12 01:42:36,i7ukj0,He wasn’t looking at the road while driving.
2882,2020-08-12 04:02:50,i7ukj0,"Guys i couldn’t watch tonight, how did they treated bello and annelise? Since they are returning acts"
2883,2020-08-13 00:17:54,i7ukj0,Damn they got robbed
2884,2020-08-14 17:28:53,i7ukj0,"What happened to Olox, Emerald, and the JD Marching Band? These were three amazing acts, and I doubt they were eliminated in Judge Cuts when bad acts such as Pork Chop Revue, Usama, and Michael Yo made it"
2885,2020-08-12 01:58:07,i7ukj0,"I know Archie isn't the best singer, and normally sob stories annoy me, but somehow he's different. In my mind, anyway."
2886,2020-08-12 01:59:38,i7ukj0,Now that was one emotional performance from Archie there!
2887,2020-08-12 00:51:20,i7ukj0,Only good thing was the set.
2888,2020-08-12 01:34:24,i7ukj0,"This would have worked so much better with an actual crowd, without them the weakness in one of their voices showed unfortunately"
2889,2020-08-12 01:35:09,i7ukj0,That was REALLY good 👏👏
2890,2020-08-12 00:08:06,i7ukj0,"Yeah, I'm sorry, but I don't see why this act got through to the quarter finals."
2891,2020-08-12 00:16:02,i7ukj0,I think the real talent are the trainers for being able to train a bunch of pigs. Hats off to them
2892,2020-08-12 00:18:58,i7ukj0,Why is it built like a death metal concert
2893,2020-08-12 00:40:42,i7ukj0,Buzz this Howie please
2894,2020-08-12 00:42:40,i7ukj0,they were okay but i think Bad salsa is much better
2895,2020-08-12 00:47:54,i7ukj0,"Frenchie baby's turn to twist  around, literally."
2896,2020-08-12 01:13:28,i7ukj0,Imagine listening to that in person🤯
2897,2020-08-12 01:14:19,i7ukj0,"That was worse than her audition and it was a fairly poor song choice with an overpowering backing track. That said, she has still been the best musical audition of the night so far."
2898,2020-08-12 01:15:52,i7ukj0,"I’m surprised there’s no ZoomBombers in the audience, but then again, this whole show is staged"
2899,2020-08-12 01:34:12,i7ukj0,They have very good technical skill but idk something’s just missing ..
2900,2020-08-12 01:36:06,i7ukj0,Why does AGT love corny twin acts?
2901,2020-08-12 02:07:51,i7ukj0,"Who i think will go through:

1. Archie

2. Roberta 

3. Annaliese & Bello

4. Brett 

5. could be anyone but ill say shaquira


Who i WANT to go through

1. Brett!

2. Bello & Annaliese

3. FrenchieBabyy

4. Feng E

5. Roberta"
2902,2020-08-13 22:21:33,i7ukj0,Anyone else wish Howard Stern would come back as a judge?
2903,2020-08-12 01:48:20,i7ukj0,"No more Sofia, she ruins the flow..."
2904,2020-08-12 00:20:47,i7ukj0,He might have just earned himself a spot in the semi final
2905,2020-08-12 00:22:21,i7ukj0,"BOOYAH, you killed it Feng. That’s my boy."
2906,2020-08-12 00:42:00,i7ukj0,They need to stick to being a duo. They sucked this time by spending too much time apart.
2907,2020-08-12 00:46:44,i7ukj0,Wait Sofia Vergara is COLUMBIAN?!?!?!
2908,2020-08-12 01:32:04,i7ukj0,The Ninjette twins
2909,2020-08-12 01:47:11,i7ukj0,Why would he pick Sofia to do this again when she hates it? Should have used Terry
2910,2020-08-12 01:51:46,i7ukj0,Sofia ruins it man wtf 😂 it was actually not bad lmao
2911,2020-08-12 02:14:20,i7ukj0,"Who SHOULD advance: 


Feng E 
Bello and Annaleise 
Brett Loudermilk 
Archie 
Frenchie Baby
(In my opinion the best acts)


Who will most likely advance:
Roberta (I just think it’s an automatic lock because of her being a kid singer and getting the golden buzzer, but I wasn’t impressed with her performance tonight. Then again we all thought Sophie Pecora was a lock last year and she was eliminated. Surprises happen) 

Archie (cause sob story... he was good though)

Shaquira (I just think she’s popular, I could be wrong) 

Feng E 

Brett Loudermilk

Annaleise was one of the best of the night, but people really don’t seem to like danger acts. I’m thinking of Bir Khalsa’s incredible live show performance last year and how they were eliminated."
2912,2020-08-12 01:08:30,i7ukj0,Kelly Clarkson is a terrible substitute for Simon. They're too nice to all of these mediocre acts.
2913,2020-08-12 02:03:48,i7ukj0,"Every word out of Archie's mouth is filled with *so much* emotion I'm astounded he doesn't collapse crying during his performance. He's got this perfectly raspy bluesy, sad, sullen voice that I love."
2914,2020-08-12 00:15:24,i7ukj0,"As someone who watched Big Brother and AGT, I get the cringe jokes from both Julie Chen and Howie Mandel during live shows..."
2915,2020-08-12 00:16:16,i7ukj0,LET’S GO FENG!!
2916,2020-08-12 00:33:19,i7ukj0,She’s probably gonna fall into the dunkin save tbh
2917,2020-08-12 00:41:15,i7ukj0,I will say its real good. but Idk if SImon and Maria's act is up there to the top.
2918,2020-08-12 01:27:17,i7ukj0,"Not that I want anyone to go through it, but the evil schadenfreude side of me is disappointed that it's pretty much assured nobody is getting buzzed tonight."
2919,2020-08-12 01:31:03,i7ukj0,Double dragon's turn!
2920,2020-08-12 01:49:31,i7ukj0,Archie WIlliams is the last one to perform.
2921,2020-08-12 01:52:50,i7ukj0,"Ok, that movie is a rip-off between ironman 3 villians and thor 2 villians who too the pill to be a monster."
2922,2020-08-12 02:00:49,i7ukj0,The “zoom” videos are just loops of different clips showing different emotions
2923,2020-08-12 02:54:40,i7ukj0,I was in the audience for AGT tonight and I’ve got to say the two best acts were FrenchieBabyy and Annaliese. Annaliese mostly cuz it was pretty insane and I just loved it. VOTE for both of them!!
2924,2020-08-12 03:08:09,i7ukj0,WHAT SONGS DID FENG PERFORM? it's a crazy earworm. Right on the tip of my tongue.
2925,2020-08-12 00:41:30,i7ukj0,I'd rather vote for Chris Farley's Chippendale act if he was on this show and was still alive.
2926,2020-08-12 01:24:53,i7ukj0,Michael Yo definitely brought the funny there. :)
2927,2020-08-11 21:55:05,i7ukj0,"How many ""make it through"" to the next level?  5?

Trying to make a list to keep up with the ones I want to see go through."
2928,2020-08-11 22:18:27,i7ukj0,I did not get my zoom code today
2929,2020-08-11 22:31:36,i7ukj0,Hm only 1 judge cuts episode this year?
2930,2020-08-11 23:22:35,i7ukj0,I am so ready for the live shows! It is always so much later than it feels like it should be. Hopefully there is some really good performances tonight.
2931,2020-08-11 23:59:27,i7ukj0,Showtime!
2932,2020-08-11 23:59:37,i7ukj0,IT'S COMING ON BOIS
2933,2020-08-12 00:01:57,i7ukj0,YASSS
2934,2020-08-12 00:02:03,i7ukj0,Awwww yeah!!!
2935,2020-08-12 00:05:57,i7ukj0,I’m giving the pigs 0 votes automatically
2936,2020-08-12 00:06:35,i7ukj0,Is the pig wild card or am I misremembering them getting a no in judge cuts?
2937,2020-08-12 00:13:27,i7ukj0,"Pork Chop Revue isn’t good enough to win AGT, much less proceed to the semifinals. The most positive thing I can say is that pig acts on the show is a breath of fresh air from the typical dog acts."
2938,2020-08-12 00:15:24,i7ukj0,the stage looks awesome
2939,2020-08-12 00:17:02,i7ukj0,Finally being an Xfinity user finally pays off!

2942,2020-08-12 00:27:51,i7ukj0,Is the audience sounds fake or does it come from the virtual audience?
2943,2020-08-12 00:29:34,i7ukj0,Best song!
2944,2020-08-12 00:31:09,i7ukj0,"Great redinition of the Rascal Flatts song, What Hurts the most!"
2945,2020-08-12 00:38:11,i7ukj0,Simon and Maria's turn to dance some life out there.
2946,2020-08-12 00:38:21,i7ukj0,Bruh
2947,2020-08-12 00:39:18,i7ukj0,Looks like its 70's theme for their act.
2948,2020-08-13 03:02:19,i7ukj0,Im devastaed almost all acts that i’ve enjoyed were eliminated... i didn’t even watch the singers perfomances
2949,2020-09-02 03:49:59,i7ukj0,"Hey! Anyone that wants to throw their 10 votes to my friend Alex Hooper, send me a dm on my insta @lemmylynx for a special photo 😏"

2955,2020-08-12 00:08:59,i7ukj0,Please someone buzz
2956,2020-08-12 00:09:21,i7ukj0,No buzzer yet?
2957,2020-08-12 00:09:58,i7ukj0,"I can at least get enjoyment out of act that’s super bad, this was just boring."
2958,2020-08-12 00:10:02,i7ukj0,Longest 5 minutes of My life
2959,2020-08-12 00:10:13,i7ukj0,pigs are cool but clearly not a stunt animal... i mean this was less entertaining than even the most lowtier dog acts.
2960,2020-08-12 00:11:35,i7ukj0,Why aren't the hogs wearing masks?  Off to the crock pot you go.
2961,2020-08-12 00:13:03,i7ukj0,That was horrible!!!! Definitely deserved to be buzzed.
2962,2020-08-12 00:19:55,i7ukj0,Kid is talented for sure but no way I could watch this for an entire show. Good odds he'll make it through.

1. Roberta

3. Michael 

4. Annalise & Bello 

5. Brett???"
2964,2020-08-12 00:39:28,i7ukj0,These 2 shouldn't even be here. Gonna get 1 vote just for participating.
2965,2020-08-12 05:03:14,i7ukj0,"Why didn't anyone say/notice on the show, and here in the sub, that Loudermilks trick failed?  


The arrow was supposed to leave the crossbow as he said.  It collapsed into pieces and the arrow never left.    


Total fail."
2966,2020-08-12 00:20:33,i7ukj0,"I don’t care how much skill may be required to make those sounds, they are horrendous."
2967,2020-08-12 01:55:30,i7ukj0,Archie gets 10 votes from me regardless...🙏
2968,2020-08-12 02:01:29,i7ukj0,"Only wish they had an live audience, cause tears would have been flowing."
2969,2020-08-13 01:50:43,i7ukj0,"I am really glad Feng E didn't go through, I had a lot of questions about his act because parts didn't look right specifically when he was playing, I think it might have been prerecorded audio-wise because he never had a off key at all or slight miss-tune which is nearly impossible in a normal live show. Not to mention you really can't play that fast on a Uke because of the lack of string tension."
2970,2020-08-11 21:13:54,i7ukj0,Type 1 in the replies if anyone is excited for the live shows
2971,2020-08-12 00:42:02,i7ukj0,Best act so far...by far
2972,2020-08-12 01:35:25,i7ukj0,i also liked their audition more. michael and double dragons underwhelmed
2973,2020-08-12 01:35:36,i7ukj0,I feel like the extravagant production took away from what I liked about them.
2974,2020-08-12 01:11:43,i7ukj0,"That act was lame.  Missed tossing her the rope, the stumbles, and not something I haven't seen before.  Not sure why this sub sack rides them so much."
2975,2020-08-12 01:10:19,i7ukj0,Surprise factor shouldn’t be a factor.

2977,2020-08-12 01:56:05,i7ukj0,I want this to happen.
2978,2020-08-12 07:52:07,i7ukj0,Brett deserves too anyways :3 a danger act has not won in 15 seasons so yea 1 til now
2979,2020-08-12 01:52:31,i7ukj0,Wait what exactly did he say?
2980,2020-08-12 02:00:12,i7ukj0,"Oh my god yes Piff is the best, he and Brett would get along so well"
2981,2020-08-12 01:08:08,i7ukj0,I guess you can say they have a Hard Nock life!
2982,2020-08-12 01:37:31,i7ukj0,I liked it
2983,2020-08-12 01:38:21,i7ukj0,"I like them, I think they are fun, but I liked their audition more.  I would put them through but that is only because there isn't much for competition."
2984,2020-08-12 01:39:25,i7ukj0,I thought they were better than the other singers but I think I just preferred their song choice. Like I know Roberta is the best singer but found her really boring tonight.
2985,2020-08-12 01:39:06,i7ukj0,I thought they were decent. Not amazing compared to other acts but it was good enough for me to like it.
2986,2020-08-12 00:53:18,i7ukj0,I was thinking the same thing.
2987,2020-08-12 01:43:39,i7ukj0,I mean your bf might be disappointed tho...
2988,2020-08-12 01:18:09,i7ukj0,I think that warning was for the hamsters watching at home.
2989,2020-08-12 05:03:28,i7ukj0,Imagine if Modern Family isn't done yet and Sofia got Brett in the show.
2990,2020-08-12 10:14:15,i7ukj0,Yes!
2991,2020-08-12 00:29:32,i7ukj0,Wouldn’t be AGT without poor mixing
2992,2020-08-12 00:30:34,i7ukj0,"Yeah, this would be the one time Simon would have been right about the back track if he were here."
2993,2020-08-12 00:29:45,i7ukj0,"Not as loud as yer momma

2994,2020-08-12 07:54:19,i7ukj0,>Archie WIlliams to becam a finalist :D
2995,2020-08-14 18:19:06,i7ukj0,"I thought he was ok earlier, but his last performance was very bad."
2996,2020-08-12 10:11:59,i7ukj0,"Yeah, I like her too! I like someone actually being interested in the acts. Everyone else is so composed usually. She was getting excited and I really enjoyed it."
2997,2020-08-12 01:48:23,i7ukj0,"Lmao I was thinking he looks similar, love Brendon!"
2998,2020-08-12 12:42:08,i7ukj0,Ikr! I thought he was going to get kicked out after what he did to Peaches.
2999,2020-08-13 04:39:46,i7ukj0,Who?
3000,2020-08-13 10:45:27,i7ukj0,Who
3001,2020-08-12 00:37:06,i7ukj0,"I want more people who can critique singers and not simply give a standing O for everything that goes beyond ""pretty good"". Even in complimenting Shaquira, Kelly still offered criticism, albeit incredibly polite criticism. Which is valuable for the singer but also for the viewer, because if every singer is exactly as good as every other in the competition, then no one is good."
3002,2020-08-12 00:15:45,i7ukj0,Yet he still paused in anticipation of it!
3003,2020-08-12 00:16:03,i7ukj0,Yeah its like he's finally give constructive criticism!
3004,2020-08-12 00:44:00,i7ukj0,I miss them 🥺
3005,2020-08-12 00:45:11,i7ukj0,Is it bad that I immediately thought about them
3006,2020-08-12 00:55:40,i7ukj0,it's kinda hard to have a unique act when the shows been around for all these seasons. Most type of acts already have been done. :\\
3007,2020-08-12 10:11:16,i7ukj0,"Yeah, I checked out. Wasn't feeling the singing."
3008,2020-08-12 05:00:10,i7ukj0,Same I hate what he gone through but I really hate his singing
3009,2020-08-12 10:14:56,i7ukj0,"Yeah, he's a fun guy!"
3010,2020-08-12 00:17:17,i7ukj0,I just did the same.
3011,2020-08-12 00:21:10,i7ukj0,Lol same
3012,2020-08-12 01:02:08,i7ukj0,Don’t worry it’s prerecorded
3013,2020-08-12 01:22:50,i7ukj0,Weren’t there rehearsals? Shouldn’t they know the audio levels to start at? For Shaquira too the beginning basking track was too loud/mike volume too low.
3014,2020-08-12 00:35:58,i7ukj0,alright true. I'll give him a 10 then. Since he was my favorite so far this ep.
3015,2020-08-12 00:44:56,i7ukj0,"Yep, they messed up."
3016,2020-08-12 00:44:19,i7ukj0,"Hot damn, the Nocks have shit luck."
3017,2020-08-12 00:46:41,i7ukj0,About that...
3018,2020-08-12 00:46:56,i7ukj0,Bello probably won’t even perform :/
3019,2020-08-12 00:29:27,i7ukj0,she ain't even bad looking. lol
3020,2020-08-12 00:04:47,i7ukj0,Now you can just turn off the mic and you don’t have to pretend to like all the acts
3021,2020-08-12 01:23:14,i7ukj0,"I'd 100% be in favor of a ""no sob story"" rule. Half the time they make me like the performer less."
3022,2020-08-12 01:22:46,i7ukj0,I had to watch his other stuff on youtube to become a fan so yeah.
3023,2020-08-12 01:45:19,i7ukj0,She’s used to The Voice
3024,2020-08-12 10:12:30,i7ukj0,Plus there was that weird video of him that came out.
3025,2020-08-12 02:01:16,i7ukj0,They should rename this show America’s Capable of Talent
3026,2020-08-12 00:25:10,i7ukj0,"I laugh at my native English friends when they pronounce a word weirdly, they do the same to me. It’s not because she’s foreign, it’s because ukelili is funny."
3027,2020-08-12 00:54:43,i7ukj0,are you sure? Source?
3028,2020-08-12 01:50:04,i7ukj0,"The second that I saw them standing so close, without masks, I was panicking. And then he started to gag and it was like i could see the germ flecks floating in the air."
3029,2020-08-12 00:15:04,i7ukj0,Oh God please no
3030,2020-08-12 00:21:52,i7ukj0,Feng E BONAVEGA collab when
3031,2020-08-12 00:41:58,i7ukj0,Live shoes
3032,2020-08-12 01:05:06,i7ukj0,As a different duo act by technicality?
3033,2020-08-12 01:04:10,i7ukj0,Tbh I think the producers like having them on because they’re good tv.
3034,2020-08-12 01:19:24,i7ukj0,the best comedians have been through a lot
3035,2020-08-13 05:57:19,i7ukj0,Same thoughts here. This has been a weird season. AGT has been largely affected by COVID-19. I think the show has been going downhill the past few years ever since they did Champions and COVID-19 just did them in for good. I can't ever see the show being the way it was around Seasons 11-12-13 ever again.
3036,2020-08-12 00:20:22,i7ukj0,People say that kind of nonsense all the time on this sub.
3037,2020-08-12 00:21:19,i7ukj0,"Both of them are incredible, but I’m worried they’ll share the same fate of being eliminated in semis"
3038,2020-08-12 01:18:59,i7ukj0,Who is the first?
3039,2020-08-12 01:20:35,i7ukj0,Who was the first?
3040,2020-08-12 01:32:43,i7ukj0,I didn't tune in until the end of the act. Why didn't he perform?
3041,2020-08-12 01:56:28,i7ukj0,Do you have a link?
3042,2020-08-12 02:02:22,i7ukj0,Wait what happened?
3043,2020-08-12 00:26:02,i7ukj0,"Agreed. What I liked about her was that she wasn't just another pop/R&B singer. She was bringing that vibe to an unexpected genre. But if she just sings Adele or something, then she becomes an act we've seen too many times to count."
3044,2020-08-12 00:26:26,i7ukj0,seems like she's the only one who's been performing on this show a lot... like every week now. hah
3045,2020-08-12 01:30:02,i7ukj0,"She said ""I don't want to waste my time"" as in she didn't want to waste her small talking time on the ""hi, hi, I'm a huge fan of Kelly Clarkson, yadda yadda"" she wanted to make sure she got all of her praise in for the performance. It sounded weird, but I didn't take it in a negative way. I took it that she wanted to make sure she got to use all her time applauding the performance."
3046,2020-08-12 01:27:43,i7ukj0,His former job involved interviewing celebrities (for E! I think). He's most likely interviewed her at some point.
3047,2020-08-12 01:27:38,i7ukj0,He probably interviewed her at some point. In his audition intro package he talked about how he’s interviewed lots of celebs.
3048,2020-08-12 01:27:53,i7ukj0,"I believe he used to be a reporter for MTV, or some other gossip mill, in some capacity. Could’ve been through that."
3049,2020-08-12 07:27:32,i7ukj0,Simon maria wre good
3050,2020-08-12 12:34:38,i7ukj0,"I enjoyed Michael Yo for whatever that was last night, but it didn’t really feel like stand-up comedy.  In longer specials, there’s often that break from the heavy-hitting bits where the comedian just tells more emotional stories, and that’s what it felt like.  It was good, but not what he needed to do to move on to the next round."
3051,2020-08-12 00:17:01,i7ukj0,yeah that set they were performing at is near the studio where the judges are if I can recall.
3052,2020-08-12 00:33:03,i7ukj0,I gave him 10 so the ones i like can go through
3053,2020-08-12 00:34:30,i7ukj0,I gave him 10
3054,2020-08-12 02:02:53,i7ukj0,Tmr before the Dunkin save result
3055,2020-08-12 01:34:41,i7ukj0,Sadly yes
3056,2020-08-12 02:10:33,i7ukj0,i’d be genuinely surprised if these weren’t the 5 going through
3057,2020-08-12 10:14:45,i7ukj0,I hope he doesn't win.
3058,2020-08-12 01:55:35,i7ukj0,Surely people are better than that.
3059,2020-08-12 01:56:35,i7ukj0,"Possibly. Not that many impressive acts. Hope the deadly games guy's brother wins

Eta: just remembered the Colin Thackery guy who won BGT (he was like a veteran singing war songs) so yeah Archie is probably a lock for the finals/top 5"
3060,2020-08-12 01:59:10,i7ukj0,Can’t wait for Anthony Fantano to rate his debut album a NOT GOOD
3061,2020-08-12 08:18:17,i7ukj0,Shes a rare gem!
3062,2020-08-12 05:12:28,i7ukj0,I saw this exact comment on Yt its you isn't it!!!
3063,2020-08-12 01:15:50,i7ukj0,Have you seen this show before?  She'll probably win
3064,2020-08-12 10:12:26,i7ukj0,Plus there was that weird video of him that came out.
3065,2020-08-11 17:22:31,i7ukj0,I have photos.
3066,2020-08-11 17:51:03,i7ukj0,In person
3067,2020-08-12 00:26:25,i7ukj0,Guess he was one of the acts that got montaged. I honestly don't remember most of these acts. (Heck I only remember Bello and Annaliese from previous seasons.)
3068,2020-08-12 01:04:52,i7ukj0,Simon tried to beat them to it.
3069,2020-08-12 01:13:05,i7ukj0,Archie
3070,2020-08-12 05:48:22,i7ukj0,"Bello didn't get to perform do to an injury, but they treated them very well. All the judges liked her act. She was one of the standouts of the night in my opinion."
3071,2020-08-15 01:26:03,i7ukj0,Double Dragon made it too :(
3072,2020-08-12 01:59:13,i7ukj0,It's a talent show not a who has had it hardest competition.
3073,2020-08-12 01:59:02,i7ukj0,You can feel the emotion in his singing more than the 10 year old singers
3074,2020-08-12 01:18:22,i7ukj0,I’d be surprised if those weren’t paid staffers
3075,2020-08-12 01:35:42,i7ukj0,I found that too. They were just walking and singing. Nothing much to it ..
3076,2020-08-12 01:36:55,i7ukj0,octomoms children could audition some day and make it thru
3077,2020-08-12 07:25:49,i7ukj0,Your want list is what should happen but knowing this show its likely it wont
3078,2020-08-12 10:08:13,i7ukj0,I think Bello is done.
3079,2020-08-12 01:54:01,i7ukj0,Part of the act.
3080,2020-08-12 00:47:41,i7ukj0,"Yup. Even in Modern Family, they made it a part of her character that she was Colombian."
3081,2020-08-12 00:54:05,i7ukj0,What did you think she was?
3082,2020-08-12 01:47:49,i7ukj0,It’s part of the act
3083,2020-08-12 04:40:33,i7ukj0,I agree with your list! And same..hopefully bello&annaleise do get through because they seem like they are a popular danger duo since they were both on AGT before and they made it to finals of BGT champions. If we lose both and Brett I’m gonna be mad lol
3084,2020-08-12 22:51:41,i7ukj0,"Biggest disagreement who will likely advance  - Shaquira.  With singers you kind of have to compare and let's face it, she wasn't as good as Roberta or Archie.  Further, she was pitchy, I don't think she has any chance of moving forward."
3085,2020-08-12 01:09:20,i7ukj0,Bruh if you're saying bello is overrated you're opinion but why?
3086,2020-08-12 01:11:33,i7ukj0,Simon’s too nice nowadays anyways.
3087,2020-08-12 07:26:33,i7ukj0,arch becomssent hom would be sad
3088,2020-08-12 00:19:15,i7ukj0,Same here although Julie wins the award for most awkward live tv appearance. (Especially when the Have not room failed to open.)
3089,2020-08-13 01:43:28,i7ukj0,How did you get in on that
3090,2020-08-12 06:48:26,i7ukj0,"Wasn’t it Seven Nation Army??

Edit: Just checked the video of his performance on Youtube, apparently it was a mashup! An original from Feng called Stalker in the Shadow, Seven Nation Army, and Smoke on the Water."
3091,2020-08-12 08:19:27,i7ukj0,your opinion :)
3092,2020-08-12 00:11:12,i7ukj0,"No they got sent through without performing, one of the acts that was told while being televised."
3093,2020-08-12 00:27:27,i7ukj0,living on a prayer? not sure.
3094,2020-08-12 10:10:28,i7ukj0,I think Bello is done. Lol. He did the act already. It's just a circus act. Not sure why it's loved on here so much.
3095,2020-08-12 02:03:09,i7ukj0,Roberta because of the pop her audition got
3096,2020-08-12 11:15:13,i7ukj0,[deleted]
3097,2020-08-12 00:11:57,i7ukj0,"I typically love animal acts but that felt like an eternity.

I don't know what the average length of an animal act is, but that felt *significantly* longer."
3098,2020-08-12 00:13:50,i7ukj0,Yeah when I watch the pig act I think back on how amazing the Olate Dogs were back in the day. One of them was doing summer saults and wheel barreling each other.
3099,2020-08-12 02:26:09,i7ukj0,Archie is the one who needs ??? Not brett lol
3100,2020-08-12 10:05:56,i7ukj0,"I thought it was a joke. With the way she was acting, I don't think he would have wanted her to have a working one."
3101,2020-08-12 14:53:52,i7ukj0,That was part of the act.
3102,2020-08-13 04:11:17,i7ukj0,Sofia took to fucking long so he had to finish the act quick holy crap I thought he would have learned she incompetent the first time.
3103,2020-08-12 01:56:36,i7ukj0,See It’s working
3104,2020-08-12 01:57:09,i7ukj0,That’s a bad way to look at a *talent* show.
3105,2020-08-12 07:48:50,i7ukj0,if only 5 get through how will they do the sem finales?
3106,2020-08-12 10:10:46,i7ukj0,Weren't there people watching online?
3107,2020-08-15 01:26:51,i7ukj0,Feng E is better than Double Dragon.
3108,2020-08-12 01:17:51,i7ukj0,Not sure the downvotes. I agree. It just wasn’t a clean act. Doesn’t matter if you or I can’t do it. It was just sloppy and not very good.
3109,2020-08-12 01:12:28,i7ukj0,[deleted]
3110,2020-08-13 01:48:57,i7ukj0,"I agree with you on everyone but Roberta, I honestly don't think Feng E was actually playing, his strings were extreamly loose and not ridid enough to produce enough of a tone and if you look he really wasn't hitting them."
3111,2020-08-12 05:06:34,i7ukj0,I think no one will
3112,2020-08-12 01:55:12,i7ukj0,Sofia asked him who he was going to do his performances with when she isn’t there and he said “what are you gonna do fall off a bike?”
3113,2020-08-12 01:09:17,i7ukj0,r/Angryupvote
3114,2020-08-12 01:57:53,i7ukj0,That sword is an exception
3115,2020-08-12 05:33:14,i7ukj0,"I was thinking the same thing!!! He’s so funny and they have such a natural chemistry, they seem like they’ve known each other for years and not a few months lol"
3116,2020-08-13 11:04:43,i7ukj0,"Maybe they don't care or think it's serious enough to get rid of him. They can't not be aware of it, right?"
3117,2020-08-13 11:27:56,i7ukj0,Archie.
3118,2020-08-13 11:10:31,i7ukj0,Archie.
3119,2020-08-12 01:04:08,i7ukj0,"Well and if the compliments include something unique about each of the singers that’s helpful to me. I’m sort of tone deaf, so my only judgement for singers is if their voice sounds good to me. So if they all sound good I have no idea which one should win over the others."
3120,2020-08-12 01:02:26,i7ukj0,I know
3121,2020-08-12 01:43:25,i7ukj0,They really did.... I almost fell asleep during the performance
3122,2020-08-12 00:48:48,i7ukj0,This did not age well haha
3123,2020-08-12 01:55:05,i7ukj0,No kidding.....
3124,2020-08-12 01:19:48,i7ukj0,Someone from Divas and Drummers caught it. They dropped out of the competition bc of it
3125,2020-08-12 01:33:17,i7ukj0,An injury during rehearsal
3126,2020-08-12 01:58:24,i7ukj0,https://www.reddit.com/r/agt/comments/gshems/proof_archie_williams_harassed_lovely_peaches/ This was the thread I remember
3127,2020-08-12 05:00:56,i7ukj0,What happened?
3128,2020-08-12 10:13:03,i7ukj0,Really creepy clip of him talking to a woman came out. Someone posted on here. I'm surprised the show didn't address it.
3129,2020-08-12 00:29:15,i7ukj0,"That could actually help her more than being a Golden Buzzer, in the same way it helped Shin Lim. He didn't get any byes, so we didn't go weeks without seeing him. He had to perform every single round to get to the end. We got to know him more than most. And I feel like it could be the same with Shaquira."
3130,2020-08-12 02:03:15,i7ukj0,Thanks!
3131,2020-08-12 05:15:27,i7ukj0,"Yeah. I often post on Reddit first and edit my comment over to YouTube for the grander audience. This comment just didn’t need an edit. I suspect I’m too negative for that crowd, but I figure someone’s got to be, so why not?"
3132,2020-08-12 01:18:47,i7ukj0,If a kid singer wins this season it will be daneilya
3133,2020-08-11 21:13:27,i7ukj0,Link them then
3134,2020-08-12 18:45:10,i7ukj0,"Nice, did they acknowledge that they are returning acts or pretend that they never knew them before like simon does to some acts thar perform in bgt and agt?"
3135,2020-08-15 01:27:14,i7ukj0,They were good though
3136,2020-08-12 02:13:05,i7ukj0,Not really. It’s more like “America’s favorite talent”    If it was all about talent they wouldn’t have open voting. Kind of like how so you think you can dance is “America’s favorite dancer” not the best dancer.
3137,2020-08-12 02:00:13,i7ukj0,Definitely true.

3139,2020-08-12 01:54:26,i7ukj0,I don't think so
3140,2020-08-12 01:05:16,i7ukj0,I was joking lol

3145,2020-08-12 15:39:21,i7ukj0,Well at least its an actual danger act
3146,2020-08-12 02:06:39,i7ukj0,I don't think the Nock duo is going through.  Act was full of mistakes and Bello wasn't even in it.
3147,2020-08-12 11:16:35,i7ukj0,Yikes just an opinion 😂
3148,2020-08-12 04:56:59,i7ukj0,"It's not about the needs, it's about who deserved it and although he's story is super sad and depressing Brett did a better job than him."
3149,2020-08-12 10:19:15,i7ukj0,It was really a joke if that arrow really shoot it would kill him. Even Ryan stock need a pipe to stop an arrow to his throat. I think what he wanted us to realise is that one card falled in his throat and he was choking about it but it just came out weird. It would've been better if there's real audience there.

3159,2020-08-12 02:01:09,i7ukj0,Oh shit. He was behind the Lovely Peaches thing? That is not a good look.
3160,2020-08-12 10:13:15,i7ukj0,Really creepy clip of him talking to a woman came out. Someone posted on here. I'm surprised the show didn't address it.

3169,2020-08-13 10:58:12,i7ukj0,I don't think we should like acts just because. There's not going to be good acts in every category every year.
3170,2020-08-12 02:18:44,i7ukj0,I think we should excuse a few mistakes in an act like that. The technical difficulty and risk is through the roof. Plus Bello (if they get a chance to perform again) will be there next time. Not much you can do if there was an injury. I actually kinda like that his daughter got a chance to make a name for herself tonight. Last time we didn't really get to see what she was capable of because she didn't make it past auditions.
3171,2020-08-12 07:11:54,i7ukj0,"Brett was better and more a vegas act, archie will do better without agt"
3172,2020-08-13 11:07:22,i7ukj0,Definitely. Hopefully things are okay next year!
3173,2020-08-16 02:09:43,i7ukj0,Then why do they do such a poor presentation on AGT?

3177,2020-08-15 01:32:44,i7ukj0,"I disagree completely. I actually thought they were good, and they were better than most of the acts that night. They’re not in my top five or even my top ten overall for this season, but they were in my top two for that episode. Them, Brett, Roberta, the Nocks, and Shaquira are my top five out of the 11 that were in the episode"
3178,2020-08-15 01:33:57,i7ukj0,Kelly Clarkson just voted for Feng E because he’s a kid and she didn’t want to send him home with four no’s (it was out of pity I think ... you could tell that she was more into Double Dragon’s Act)
3179,2020-08-12 02:26:17,i7ukj0,"Oh, I’m not saying he isn’t or isn’t good. Just that he doesn’t have to be good to get votes."
3180,2020-08-13 21:03:34,i7ukj0,"Honestly, his life is basically half gone. If being on AGT gives him a little joy, I'm cool with that. Maybe it'll make up for the justice system screwing him over. I don't think he'll win by any means."
3181,2020-08-12 01:59:35,i7ukj0,I legit think she wanted no part of it.
3182,2020-08-13 10:56:24,i7ukj0,Brett is fun! I hope to see more!
3183,2020-08-12 01:24:53,i7ukj0,I only hate them because their act is boring 🤷🏼‍♂️

3187,2020-08-12 02:38:57,i7ukj0,That's a fair point. I hate it. But you're right.

3236,2020-08-11 01:28:49,i7apbj,Id try for 2 1/2 hours if I could. While I wrote extensive backstory for some things its not like it cant be just shown in a few seconds or two like the intro. The section I know would get cut for sure is Sean & Reina off in the countryside for RT. But I think a longer film works hest to 1) explore and flesh out Sean’s character as well as the world of criminal Tokyo and 2) also does a lot to show off Japan as a country and how Sean changes and gets better because of this better environment for him. Like I like Tokyo Drift but aside from aesthetic I dont see how Sean changed a lot.

Its hard to rewrite Tokyo Drift without killing Han I realize. Hes my fave character yet I see why he gets killed off. Unless you totally changed the story, changed why theres conflict with Han and DK, etc."

3240,2020-08-10 06:37:39,i6znyj,">The fact that this was greenlit by the largest media company in the world with no one believing the title was racist, 

Do you know anything about the movie besides the title? Do you think the title came first and the movie was written around it? Are you aware it is about an African king?

Also, are you entirely opposed to a movie celebrating Africans and black Americans? I'm not saying you are, I'm really wondering if that clashes with your values"
3241,2020-08-10 06:45:35,i6znyj,"Someone else already said that the movie is about an African King. I just want to add to that something from [the wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Is_King) about it:

> ***Black Is King*** is a 2020 American [musical film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_film) and [visual album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_album) directed, written and executive produced by American singer-songwriter [Beyoncé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyonc%C3%A9).[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Is_King#cite_note-4) The film serves as a visual companion to the 2019 album [*The Lion King: The Gift*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lion_King:_The_Gift), a tie-in album curated by Beyoncé for the [2019 remake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lion_King_(2019_film)) of [*The Lion King*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lion_King). 

Not only is it about an African king, it's also a tie in to The Lion King, one of Disney's biggest movies. And also from that wiki, here's the premise:

> A young African king is cast out from his family into an unforgiving world.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Is_King#cite_note-:7-5) He subsequently undergoes a journey ""through betrayal, love and self-identity"" to reclaim his throne, utilizing the guidance of his ancestors and childhood love. The story is told through the voices of present-day black artists.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Is_King#cite_note-6) 

Sounds a lot like the animated Lion King, doesn't it? That's why it has king in the title. It's being compared to a Disney classic.

(Also want to add that this took me about a minute to google. It's not that hard to figure out what the movie is about.)"
3242,2020-08-10 06:42:26,i6znyj,">The title ""Black is King"" is obviously a supremacist title

I don't grant your premise. According to both the trailer and the film's wikipedia page, the title *Black is King* is to show the film's relationship to *The Lion King.* It's not a statement that black people are better than everyone else, it's a way to play with words to encompass both ""this is a movie about black empowerment"" and ""this movie is based on *The Lion King*."""
3243,2020-08-10 07:55:50,i6znyj,"What you are talking about the movie is incorrect, but i do agree that the ""Black is best"" idea is a huge problem, and is actually happening, like how you can't even voice black characters if you are not black, replacing white characters with black characters, and in general, a huge favoritism to black people in Hollywood and the media.

I don't like rascism against black people, but i hate it even more that the race that constantly says they are the victims, does the exact same thing they say they suffer, rascism, to other races.

Black people CAN be rascists, and if you think they can't, you are delusional and should get your head out of your ass.

Also, don't tell me these rascist actions that black people do are justified because ""They suffered rascism so now it is their turn to get revenge"" or some crap like that,  it is not justified, and most young black people barely lived any extreme rascism, and when i mean extreme, i mean the old kind of one, where they couldn't even use the same water fountain as whites."

We have black history month because black history was woefully underrepresented compared to their contribution to american culture. But when people start asking 'why don't we have white history month' they tend to get some worried glances, in part because the only people that ever seriously ask that are pretty damn racist.

Or, Lion King was always a version of Hamlet but with lions, so they could have taken note of that and just named it ""Simba"" or the like.

First off, this is less a case of racism than mistaken identity. People don't hate Andy Ngo because he is asian, they hate him because he is a fascist sympathizer who actively assists fascists under the guise of being a journalist.

Secondly, I don't think you really want to play the game of anecdotal racism, because holy fuck do white people lose that game.

> Nazis have murdered millions of people of different nations in WW2. That was terrible. But that doesn't justify the Russians mass raping millions of German women. 

Justify, no. Explain? Yeah. The fact that millions of your fellow countrymen got murdered in surprise attacks and you suffered from starvation and brutal conditions for years as a result does *explain* why a soviet soldier could be particularly brutal in their counter invasion and occupation.

I don't think being racist against white people is a good thing, or a justified thing. I'm white, I don't like people hating me for my skin color. But I sure as fuck understand why a lot of them might, given the history of my race enslaving and abusing them for centuries up to and including present day.

Of course, none of the above actually addressed my point. My point was talking about the context of certain statements. Black lives matter isn't a racist statement, because it is a call for justice for a vulnerable group. It isn't about hating white people. White lives matter, on the other hand, is almost always an out and out racist slogan, a way for racists and white supremacists to try and delegitimize and actual issue in the black community that they hate.

This isn't a matter of both sides are bad because they are racist. One side there is racist, the other is not. So when someone makes a title 'black is king' that isn't really intended to be a racist statement, so much as an empowering statement. A movie titled 'white is king' however, has entirely different historical and sociological baggage, which makes it much more likely that the person saying it is something like a white nationalist. Not necessarily, mind you, just more likely."

Well that would be saying something is ""king"". King is above all others, supreme.

To treat something like it's been largely under appreciated would be to say something like ""Black lives matter"". Not ""black lives are king"", that would be supremacist. Just like saying ""Black is King"".

If the movie was called ""Black is King"" and it was actually about how Jack Black is the best comedian alive, I would say that is not a racist title, just a comically misleading one, and certainly done in bad taste considering the modern political climate of racial tension.

King of New York, is not saying that a drug kingpin is actually somehow superior to other New Yorkers.

The issue disproportionally affects *several* minority groups. For example, the BLM movement ignores that Hispanics have it just as bad, if not worse. It ignores completely that the Irish and Italians used to be the ones that this harassment was targeting.

If I were an Italian-American, and had my father killed by the police for being Italian back when Italian mafia was a thing, and was opposed to the BLM because they make this issue out to be related to race when it really isn't, it's a government issue, and I used ""All lives matter"" as a slogan to draw attention to that, am I being a white supremacist?"

Until very recently, most black Americans have been entirely unable to trace back their heritage. They didn't know where or when or why their ancestors came to America. This loss of heritage created a 'black' identity. White Americans are often able to say at least in part where their family is from. And if they aren't, it's not because the history was literally beaten out of their ancestors, it's because it wasn't passed on.

1. They don't. The fact that you seriously tried to pull the 'maybe they have it worse even' card on this issue shows you're either uninformed or trying to bullshit.
2. BLM does actually come out and protest when police kill hispanic individuals.

>It ignores completely that the Irish and Italians used to be the ones that this harassment was targeting. 

It also ignores the evils of prohibition.  I'm not sure if you're posting from the 1940's, but in ttyol 2020, neither of those groups are remotely the target of police harassment. If they were, I'm fairly certain groups like BLM would be advocating for them as well.

It *is* a race issue, though. The systemic overpolicing, overincarceration and yes, murder of black men is in fact a race issue. Trying to act like it is a government issue when it is very, very much a race issue while *also* being a systemic issue with how we handle policing show you're either the useful idiot or malicious.

You want to know my favorite stat, just for how clever the people doing the study were? They had access to something like 180 million traffic stops, and they decided to look at daylight savings time, specifically the days before and after it switched, close to sundown.

What they found is that when daylight savings time changed, police stops of black men either increased above white people, or fell to neutral levels, depending on if sunset had been pushed back or forward due to the daylight savings time issue.

Put simply, police stops of black men compared to white men in basically every city they studied increased when the sun was up and you could see the driver was black.

Police are racist af, and this is very much a black issue."

Affirmative action does not work this way. That 'score' bullshit that you probably scrolled down to make sure they have? The article goes into why it doesn't actually work that way, and they point out that the person who gathered that data, a guy named Espenshade, said: 

“I stop short of saying that Asian-American students are being discriminated against in the college application process because we don't have sufficient empirical evidence to support that claim,”  

The article even goes into caselaw, which discusses how the supreme court has limited AA to 'A fraction of a fraction of a fraction', to the point where you can basically only look at race when it comes up as part of other factors with your application.

Affirmative action isn't 'take the black guy with worse grades over the white or asian guy'.

This is a pretty bold claim. But your evidence for this is a couple of extremely narrow negative effects of good policy. 

Come to think of it, on the progressive taxation front, I'd argue you're setting an impossible standard. If they are for progressive taxation they are racist against asian people (supposedly). Regressive taxation, then they'd be racist against blacks. Hell, even no taxation would lead to negatives to the social safety net, which would hit blacks harder.

When talking about wide ranging policy like this, it is essentially impossible to create a policy in which everyone wins. Given this, it seems absurd to claim that a group is racist for pushing for what they think is good policy, when that policy is about as race neutral as you can get.

This is why intent is important. If I pass a law cutting welfare, that will hurt black people more than white people. Now theoretically I could do this in a way that isn't racist (just stupid imho), but if I'm passing the law with the intent of fucking over black people? I'd argue intent matters.

They ain't following that standard right now.

And no, I don't claim that ""progressives are the real racists"" or anything like that, I only claim that progressive policies also tend to result in preferential treatment and mistreatment along racial lines, and not only against whites (which, by the way, I find racist in and of itself - whites are a race too and you can be racist against them), but against minorities too. The only way to win here is not to play the game of whack-a-mole with the government as the hammer (which, seeing as I'm a libertarian, also sounds like an alright idea to me, but I doubt you wanna debate that either)."

The policies that harm african americans were (and often still are) specifically targeted on racial grounds, often with specific intent to harm that group. The policies you gave that harm asian americans (as much as they do, since that is in contention anyways) are policies that do so abstractly or incidentally at best. 

Moreover, they are policies that are essentially zero sum, as I've explained to you. Your argument is that support for affirmative action proves progressives are racist against asians, but if they didn't support it I could argue they are racist against african americans (since being against it would hurt them). Progressive taxes mean that asian american families pay more in taxes than the mean, but regressive taxes would hurt african americans more (and they are more vunerable).

You're in a catch 22 where any policy we look at is racist (even though it is not comparable to say, voter ID laws specifically targeting minorities), which should tell you that your argument is essentially worthless. If every single policy could be viewed as racist then the word becomes meaningless.

Could you at least clarify that you understand what I'm talking about here, so I don't feel like I'm screaming into the wind.

Fake Edit: Also, I got bored and I checked, The median household income numbers you gave me end up being so eyerolling it hurts. With the current brackets, assuming the median income listed, Asian families pay a higher rate on approximately 7,000 worth of income. This 10% increase amounts to about $900/year more than they would be paying if the 3rd bracket were extended to 88,000.

This is such a nothingburger it hurts my fucking soul."
3296,2020-08-10 10:43:31,i6znyj,"> You're in a catch 22 where any policy we look at is racist 

Actually, I agree. They are all racist. Whenever you try to do government, you are kinda bound to screw groups of people over, and race tends to be correlated to pretty much everything among groups of people, hence you always end up disproportionately screwing over races. Perhaps different ones with different laws, but screwing them over nonetheless. Progressive policies tend to screw over the better off, i.e. the Whites and Asians. Conservative policies tend to screw over the worse off, so Blacks primarily. The way to end racism within the government is to end the government.

> This is such a nothingburger it hurts my fucking soul.

How much tax do you pay? It's a genuine question. Because I'm pretty sure Asians could've used those $900/year. That's not an insignificant amount of money, at least it certainly isn't to me. Oh, also, you forget state income taxes."

Strawman. I said nothing about protests and demonstrations

But to entertain this, she never  once protested.  She served in the Army. and there is not nor never was a consensus that protests had any affect on human right policies, as many regard the action as mere social justice theatre. As we see today. 

Policies will change when they want to change, not solely because some people riot and protest. There ARE other means to get policy reform. She never attributed any rights gained by civil rights movement.

3359,2020-08-08 00:48:04,i5poq1,I know this will be unpopular but i think he would be the perfect Lobo.
3360,2020-08-08 00:48:15,i5poq1,"He's definitely not a host because they had a separate list for that. I certainly hope that he's not apart of Superhero High, something that he'd be wasting his talent on but for some reason feel he'd be down to do. I hope that it's something to do with JL Dark or Black Adam."
3361,2020-08-08 03:08:25,i5poq1,I think he'd be a great John Henry Irons.

3367,2020-08-08 05:28:10,i5poq1,Terry Crews is always a win.
3368,2020-08-08 01:54:29,i5poq1,"He’s not a host as he’s not in the host list, so I feel like he’ll be in a movie rather than tv show but regarding what character he could play? Hmmmmm..."
3369,2020-08-08 05:34:17,i5poq1,If they are making a Superman movie then John Henry Irons
3370,2020-08-08 09:46:30,i5poq1,"John Stewart, hopefully"
3371,2020-08-08 01:52:37,i5poq1,Superman.

You can't go wrong with Terry Crews."

3375,2020-08-08 00:44:51,i5poq1,Sure hope he’s not playing Hawkman
3376,2020-08-08 03:19:05,i5poq1,My vote is Prof pyg only because i think it would be incredibly redicioulus
3377,2020-08-08 02:14:22,i5poq1,"I think he'd be fine in a supporting role, of some sort."

3380,2020-08-08 13:22:07,i5poq1,Mr Terrific or honestly he’d be a funny Booster Gold if Nathan Fillion doesn’t do it. Time traveling Terry Crews trying to convince people how awesome he is as a hero

Terry is The Man

3383,2020-08-08 03:55:13,i5poq1,Nah he’s gonna be a completely off-the-wall artistic liberty super terry crews version of John Stewart. Live action teen titans GO style justice league spin off
3384,2020-08-08 04:25:43,i5poq1,Just a random guess but maybe Flashpoint cyborg. He could totally pull of a giant superman-esque cyborg. Even though there is no Atlantis Vs Amazonians war.
3385,2020-08-08 10:06:39,i5poq1,"John Stewart with Ryan Reynolds returning in Justice League, and then we get Green Lantern Corps as an intergalactic buddy cop film with them both."
3386,2020-08-08 00:43:16,i5poq1,Hawkman.
3387,2020-08-08 19:57:57,i5poq1,"Mr Crews is also an artist, so it could be possible that he’s announced on a new book instead of a movie or tv show."
3388,2020-08-08 20:49:11,i5poq1,Might just be a voice actor
3389,2020-08-08 21:24:56,i5poq1,I'm just glad he's there.
3390,2020-08-09 02:29:48,i5poq1,I think he may play black lightning
3391,2020-08-08 03:39:43,i5poq1,Idris Elba was also on the list which has me curious
3392,2020-08-08 01:23:01,i5poq1,Lex Luthor
3393,2020-08-08 02:43:09,i5poq1,I feel like he will just be a host. Maybe of a panel.
3394,2020-08-08 03:20:56,i5poq1,I can’t believe the characters y’all want him for. Lmao Lobo? Mr. Terrific? Kilowog? Are y’all being serious?
3395,2020-08-08 03:20:10,i5poq1,"He’s a trash individual and trash actor, so I couldn’t be less interested in his involvement"

3397,2020-08-08 04:51:54,i5poq1,Always wanted him to be Attrocitus

3400,2020-08-08 19:17:19,i5poq1,I think he'd be an awesome Kilowag!
3401,2020-08-08 01:06:22,i5poq1,Good pick but I'd hate if Kilowag was casted before any of earth's Lanterns.
3402,2020-08-08 17:03:34,i5poq1,Wow i love this
3403,2020-08-08 02:15:15,i5poq1,Perfection
3404,2020-08-08 10:26:20,i5poq1,best casting ever.
3405,2020-08-08 01:04:55,i5poq1,"That's actually popular, there's literally a petition for it."
3406,2020-08-08 01:30:34,i5poq1,"I dunno what it is, I just honestly cannot see Terry Crews playing a character who isn't wholesome. I get he must do it, but I just can't picture Terry Crews smoking or drinking."
3407,2020-08-08 07:29:31,i5poq1,I’d like a sleazier actor to be Lobo.
3408,2020-08-08 08:02:17,i5poq1,"Brad Garrett.

Don't dress him up or give him a wig or makeup. Just straight up Robert Barone saying Bastich and Who's the Main Man? while punching Superman"
3409,2020-08-08 14:13:33,i5poq1,"Dunno about unpopular, I would LOVE to see a Lobo and Terry would fit him well."
3410,2020-08-08 04:14:17,i5poq1,Edge WWE is perfect for Lobo.
3411,2020-08-08 10:36:08,i5poq1,I'm hoping he's Wildcat
3412,2020-08-08 19:19:26,i5poq1,Imagine a world without a Superman miniseries for HBO max....that'd be awesome.
3413,2020-08-08 18:51:17,i5poq1,yes 🤞🏼  Steel would be awesome to see.
3414,2020-08-09 08:50:16,i5poq1,"I dunno, Terry looks too kind. I imagine John to be tough looking in the eyes."
3415,2020-08-08 12:50:24,i5poq1,Yas!
3416,2020-08-08 10:36:39,i5poq1,To be fair I'd actually be really scared if Pyg was 6:4
3417,2020-08-08 10:39:28,i5poq1,Plus IDK why but I can buy Ray Fisher's conflicted young Cyborg growing into a very All Might esque Terry Crews
3418,2020-08-08 21:38:50,i5poq1,Jesus christ no
3419,2020-08-08 03:40:12,i5poq1,Idris elba is going to be in suicide squad thats why
3420,2020-08-08 03:42:58,i5poq1,i think a good chunk will be voicing characters in some games or something.
3421,2020-08-08 03:41:17,i5poq1,Did Terry do something bad?
3422,2020-08-08 03:40:07,i5poq1,How is he a trash individual?
3423,2020-08-08 02:52:09,i5poq1,Deadshot is not The Suicide Squad. Will Smith is currently still as Deadshot and not recasted.
3424,2020-08-08 10:25:52,i5poq1,atrocitus loves yogurt :)
3425,2020-08-08 12:49:04,i5poq1,Holy shit. Would wanna see.
3426,2020-08-08 01:51:40,i5poq1,"I mean, Black Adam was casted long before Shazam."
3427,2020-08-08 01:26:54,i5poq1,Nice to know im not the only one who wants this
3428,2020-08-08 11:19:31,i5poq1,That's a good choice.
3429,2020-08-08 14:15:15,i5poq1,Is there a JSA movie in the works or...? Didn't know we would be getting another Wildcat right after the Stargirl Wildcat.
3430,2020-08-08 16:22:29,i5poq1,"Who wouldn't!?
My other vote was he should totally be condiment king or some other incredibly rediculous character"
3431,2020-08-08 10:40:18,i5poq1,Exactly!
3432,2020-08-08 03:41:23,i5poq1,Oh dang.... Thanks I'm much more excited for that. I'll never give up on an Idris John Stewart tho
3433,2020-08-08 10:41:01,i5poq1,Apprently he's Vigilante (I'll be sad he isn't MMH)
3434,2020-08-08 04:00:02,i5poq1,"I agree, but I think most of the people in this comment section are talking about live action and Crews as any of those characters sounds horrendous to me."
3435,2020-08-08 05:36:28,i5poq1,"He doesn’t align with the liberal hivemind and is outspoken about it, thus he’s a trash individual."
3436,2020-08-08 03:52:59,i5poq1,"His homophobic statements, ridiculously tone deaf BLM tweets, pro-China position, shaming people for watching porn, backstabbing Gabrielle Union. 

Where to start?"
3437,2020-08-08 06:37:46,i5poq1,"it's CAST for fuck's sake!  
why does everyone use CASTED."
3438,2020-08-08 02:02:54,i5poq1,I can't even fathom how that is even comprable.
3439,2020-08-08 01:34:22,i5poq1,"Yeah there's a few articles about it. I wouldn't personally say that I'd want it but I'm not actively against it, especially since my #1 choice is off the board."
3440,2020-08-09 09:55:15,i5poq1,Thanks xx
3441,2020-08-09 01:50:28,i5poq1,"It was widely rumored for a while that some form of the JSA would be in the Black Adam movie, which was more or less confirmed when they recently announced the hiring of an actor to play Atom Smasher."
3442,2020-08-09 09:53:06,i5poq1,According to rumours Black Adam will feature the JSA including Dr. Fate
3443,2020-08-08 09:24:28,i5poq1,"Anyone who says ""liberal hivemind"" is someone who is a waste of oxygen"
3444,2020-08-08 04:32:24,i5poq1,Ok so other than the BLM stuff I hadn’t really heard about any of that. After like 10 minutes of searching I think he has a bunch of weird takes on hot button issues that he words in the worst possible way. The China stuff all I saw was the weird pictures he tweeted when he went on vacation there. In general I think he’s ignorant of a lot of things and the weight his words have but I don’t think he’s a trash person.
3445,2020-08-08 06:51:12,i5poq1,"Cause when you don’t know the unique past tense of a word, you would assume it would be “ed”. Also it’s not that serious."
3446,2020-08-08 07:20:09,i5poq1,"Because not everyone is English, so for foreign people it sounds right."
3447,2020-08-08 02:04:56,i5poq1,Cause normally you would cast the hero before their villain. Imagine casting riddler before Batman in Matt Reece’s Batman movie.
3448,2020-08-08 15:33:16,i5poq1,Momoa?
3449,2020-08-08 12:42:18,i5poq1,"surprise, I'm not a native speaker either.  
that's not an excuse.

also, it only started appearing a few months ago and it's fucking everywhere now."
3450,2020-08-08 02:07:14,i5poq1,What the hell does that have to do with Kilowag?
3451,2020-08-08 16:19:18,i5poq1,You know it lol
3452,2020-08-08 12:56:40,i5poq1,It’s actually “It only started appearing a few months ago”. To say “It only started appearing since a few months ago” isn’t correct. Or to put it in your terms...ahem...Putting “SINCE” is a needless addition to that sentence for fuck’s sake! Why does everyone add words that don’t belong?! Or we can just realize people may not be as fluent in their non native language and chill out a little bit.
3453,2020-08-12 07:40:32,i5poq1,Typos are as weak a convention as swearing though and you dip into that like every comment is a special occasion 😉
3454,2020-08-08 02:08:11,i5poq1,Because you’re saying you’d hate it if kilowag was casted before the earth lantern who would be the main green lantern. I’m saying they’ve casted in different orders before.
3455,2020-08-08 13:12:20,i5poq1,"cool, fixed. thanks."
3456,2020-08-08 02:11:20,i5poq1,"Ok....what the hell does that have to do with my personal preference? I'm not saying that it will never happen or that it has never happened, I'm simply saying that I'd hate to see Kilowag casted before the main Lanterns."
3457,2020-08-08 13:23:32,i5poq1,Lol
3458,2020-08-08 02:12:00,i5poq1,And I’m just saying similar stuff has happened before. Nothing else.
3459,2020-08-08 02:14:20,i5poq1,"I mean okay but I was never making a point against that, or in favor of it for that matter, I was just saying what I, as an individual would/wouldn't want. Very strange."
3460,2020-08-08 02:15:00,i5poq1,Dude your just dragging this out now calm down
3461,2020-08-08 02:14:56,i5poq1,I think you got way too defensive.
3462,2020-08-08 02:16:10,i5poq1,What? Lol what in the actual fuck is happening right now.

3484,2020-08-05 07:46:18,i407oo,I know exactly how you feel. I follow a sub focused on female improvement and they were talking about how the term Karen is used to vilify and mock women. I made a comment about how they were ignoring the fact that that term was originally used to describe women who weaponize their whiteness and socioeconomic status against minorities and hit downvoted. It’s asinine they create these spaces “for women” but never take the steps to make sure it’s a safe space fir all women
3485,2020-08-05 12:35:10,i407oo,"100%. The white people on this site are buy and large,  those Not Racists that just dont want you to disrupt their fun, and its a toxic place to be sometimes. I left that community when it looked to be dominated by sycophant-y white women sucking white dick and fetishizing poc, have not looked back.

Edit: r/Ebonyimagination was a really great way for me to see black people on my reddit feed. In addition to r/blackhair. I also unsubbed from most tv/media subs because the narrative analysis by the sub is always overwhelmingly white.

The idea that equality will lead to Black people thinking they can take over is the kind of assumption that white people make because they come at the issue from the perspective of, ""well, *I* would take more than my fair share if I could"" (which is what they've already been doing). Him echoing that makes him sound very pick-me... like, he wants to be the Black man who white people feel is safe because he'll let them be comfortable in their privilege.

3504,2020-09-07 19:25:51,io9nwp,"Ryan Coogler's remake of The Lion King

Mostly the same movie except:

\-Michael B. Jordan is Simba rather than Donald Glover (whose just now part of the soundtrack) and Tessa Thompson or Lupita N'Yongo are Nala instead of Beyonce, who is also now just part of the soundtrack.

\-The cast is made up not just mostly of African-Americans with white people playing the sidekicks but now it's a completely black cast, even the comic reliefs. So now Timon and Pumbaa are voiced by Kevin Hart and Winston Duke while Zazu is voiced by Richard Aoyade.

\-More of an emphasis on the lion/hyena conflict. Rather than all of the hyenas being evil, most of the hyenas are good and are unfairly lumped in with the evil hyenas due to an ongoing feud between the two species. Scar actually cares about the feud and wants to stop it by bringing the hyenas back in but does so by wanting to giving the evil hyenas control. Simba and Nala both have a mini-arc where they realize that not all of the hyenas are bad, maybe even starting as children by having them befriend a young hyena when they first get into the elephant graveyard before running into the bad hyenas, and, at the end, they let their hyena friend, now an adult, and the other good hyenas into the pridelands while the evil hyenas are banished.

\-Simba has an arc where he realizes that not all of Mufasa's teachings were correct, as he grows up with Timon and Pumbaa's friends (yeah in the remake they had friends. Bet you forgot about that) and learns to be more of an empathetic, loving ruler by seeing their problems firsthand, which helps him emphasize with the hyenas even more. At the end, Mufasa's ghost gives almost the same speech but then adds something about changing things for the best.

\-The songs are relegated to being background music and there's a song by Kendrick Lamar over the end credits."
3505,2020-09-07 17:42:03,io9nwp,"Taika Waititi's Mulan - starring Awkwafina

Since it's a Disney remake, it draws heavily from the original cartoon in story beats, set pieces, and themes. However, where this remake adds value is leaning in harder on the comedy. Combining Waititi and Awkwafina's comedic chops, the movie is quippy (but not in Whedon's ""stop everything, here's a punch up line,"" style) but also maintains the heartfelt moments. 

The movie, largely stays the same. They don't include Mushu or ancestral ghosts because those elements play stronger in a cartoon and will look out of place in a live action movie (for the same reason, the hallucination phoenix is not here either). 

The little cricket friend WILL be traveling in Mulan's armor as her companion. The cricket will not have dialogue, but Waititi will voice its cricket chirps. The cricket will allow Mulan to speak to/react to something and inject some personality into the character. Furthermore, her horse will be a more important character and he'll play a role more like the one in the cartoon.

They do away with the love interest story all together. Instead it's more of a student/teacher respect relationship between Mulan and the Commander. Where after finding out she's a girl, he has to grow in his character arc by overcoming his prejudice to recognize Mulan, his best soldier's, skill/ingenuity as a warrior despite her gender. 

As for the villiain, he should be more imposing and command a large mongol army and not a witch woman + 7 masked dudes. Think of Khotun Khan from the PS4 game, Ghost of Tsushima. Jason Scott Lee wasn't imposing enough in his character design, at least. I feel like an older villain played by like Benedict Wong would've been a different fit. 

I don't mind them removing all the musical numbers from the new Mulan since it's going for more serious war movie tone. I can imagine Waititi going the same route. But since it's a more comedic tone movie, they have an opportunity to inject some levity into scenes like the training scenes or the match making scene."
3506,2020-09-07 21:16:12,io9nwp,"The Coen Brothers direct Finding Nemo

The film starts with Nemo witnessing his mother devoured by Bruce the shark. Nemo's neurotic father, Marlin, installs plexiglass on the balcony of their home to keep Nemo from venturing to the Abyss. School is hell for Nemo with his classmates and even his teacher calling him ""bubble fish"" because his father is so protective. In despair Nemo chooses to dive into the Abyss and end it all but just as he jumps he's sucked into the current of a boat propeller and captured by two stupid, violent fish traffickers. The traffickers make the mistake of trying to capture a dolphin who they plan to sell to Seaworld. This dolphin happens to be the son of a very influential mob dolphin. The dolphin pod surrounds and capsizes the boat, drown the traffickers, then run them through the boat's motor. Sharks, including Bruce, swarm the area. Nemo becomes a mule for some bacteria the dolphins want to transport to Australia, bacteria intended to infect and kill a particular pelican who has offended the dolphin boss. Through a series of ironic circumstances Bruce and Nemo wind up sleeping in the same sunken ship which contains 100 year old Pappy Van Winkle which Bruce accidentally cracks while chasing Nemo through the ship. Bruce speaks longingly   about a place called Australia, once a haven for human criminals, where even a criminal fish has a chance to start over. At least that's the ancient story sharks tell about it. After a night of drunken conversation and a tearful apology from Bruce for eating Nemo's mom, Nemo swims away while Bruce sleeps it off, horrified that his mother's killer has planted this nagging desire for Australia in his gut. And yet that is his destination.

Meanwhile Marlin has frantically swum into the Abyss without a plan. His meeting with Dory is similar to the Disney version, Dory is already a Coen character. The rest of the journey is Marlin trying to ditch Dory and Dory keeps finding him. At one point inside the whale Marlin pushes Dory into a pool of digestive fluid which causes the whale to vomit the both of them up. Through out the rest of the film one or the other of them has to stop and hack up whale chunks.

Marlin and Dory meet up with Crush, an ancient turtle and his bale. He's a cult leader who preaches peace and awareness through adventure sports. Marlin must run the gauntlet of jellyfish in order for Crush to let him ride the current to Australia. He tries to leave Dory behind but Crush prophesies that Dory is instrumental in reuniting Marlin with Nemo. Annoyed Marlin finally accept the paring.

Nemo is captured before he can find the Pelican but the bacteria comes in handy when, following Gil's advice,  he is able to transfer it onto Darla's braces as she squeezes him and attempts to kiss him. Darla become comatose. Nemo feels bad but Gil tells him that she will eventually awaken as a gentler, kinder soul. Gil orchestrates an escape when the ambulance comes for Darla. Meanwhile the Pelican who has befriended Dory, sees Nemo come out of the drain and helps Marlin and Nemo reunite. 

Nemo refuses to return home. He settles in his own place in Australia. Marlin takes a place nearby with the caveat that he will get counseling and respect Nemo's boundaries. Dory becomes the Pelican's fin candy when Gil tells him that sharks are repelled by her species. Their bar becomes one of the hottest fish rave spots in Australia. Final scene Gil meets up with the Dolphin. Turns out Gil was lying about everything."

Then later, someone mentions that they would probably also be living in his beard. So he bleaches it. Then someone mentions that they would also be in his nose hairs, so he trims those too.

3596,2020-09-06 06:46:55,inbylk,Mine is getting annoyed of his parroting on JRE (back when I still watched it when it was ok-ish) then stumbling upon this sub and hearing him say stupid shit or faking stuff up like donation to Ray Borg.
3597,2020-09-06 00:15:24,inbylk,"Already did. Posted to r/moronavirus, r/cringe, r/iamatotalpieceofshit, r/cringepics, etc on this and other throwaways but I lack the skills to bring the heat. That and some posts got removed.

I only found one YT vid of em making fun of Terry Crews. There was a big list on here but I couldn't find it anymore."
3598,2020-09-06 06:44:49,inbylk,"I think we're aware that they're just some D-list celebrities. Plus the public don't need to know who they actually are, they only need to see or hear the shitty things these scums say. Most of the posts on subs like r/cringe are ""civilians"" anyway (the people who do the cringey things I mean).

That's the only thing they should be known for: saying dumb misinformed things confidently."

3624,2020-09-04 02:27:22,ilvm27,I watched the first season and a couple/few episodes of season 2 of BB. I took a break and when I went back it was season 4. I blamed GF's kids but it turned out that it was her. I was too lazy to figure out where I left off so never finished it.
3625,2020-09-04 02:28:44,ilvm27,You can jump back in anywhere near it...if you miss a couple episodes it's not going to ruin it.

3633,2020-09-02 18:09:31,il7uqj,"Totally agree. One of the best characters in all of the series. I adore her. 

She is the perfect feminist. She's smart, independent, self assured but vulnerable actually really kind.

I won't spoil it but there's a few episodes early season 2 where she goes against her own personal feelings and instincts just because its the right thing to do instead of being mean and spiteful. Honestly she just gets better as the series goes on...."
3634,2020-09-02 15:16:33,il7uqj,Maggie should have been fired on episode 2
3635,2020-09-02 18:24:54,il7uqj,I love every sloan scene but the shake shack scene!!!!!
3636,2020-09-10 01:26:04,il7uqj,Sloan Sabbath is my favorite Olivia Munn role.
3637,2020-09-03 04:02:13,il7uqj,I randomly rewatched the first five episodes a few days ago and was surprised to spot Stranger Thing's Hopper in there as Elliott.
3638,2020-09-02 18:11:26,il7uqj,Cool... So far I find her super intelligent but clueless...

3641,2020-09-24 03:59:33,il7uqj,"She should have. And there's two more moments when should have been fired later on. But she definitely grows, and has a bit of a redemptive quality about her.

But don't ever get into a fucking relationship with her whatever you do. Or let her set you up. Or allow any sort of vested interest in your personal life really."
3642,2020-09-02 21:11:46,il7uqj,The soda slurp is funny AH though!

3644,2020-10-01 06:53:32,il7uqj,"Imo, by far her best acting job and she played the role perfectly. Love Sloan so much."
3645,2020-09-02 18:13:25,il7uqj,"Yes she is. Not much street smarts but its really endearing. And funny. I dont know how she gets away with sassing Charlie so much... 

By the middle of S2 you will want to marry her regardless of your gender or sexual preference."
3646,2020-09-24 03:56:32,il7uqj,Came here to make sure that was posted. Just saw that episode yesterday and I loved that moment.

3649,2020-09-02 18:02:25,il7uqj,Isn't she supposed to get her shit together by the end?
3650,2020-09-03 00:19:32,il7uqj,I mean... he's right. Lol.
3651,2020-09-02 18:05:15,il7uqj,You'll see. She definitely has an arc as a character.
3652,2020-09-02 18:05:57,il7uqj,"I'm not gonna spoil anything, but when you keep watching, you'll know!"
3653,2020-09-02 18:06:37,il7uqj,LOL (lots of love) Ok...

3671,2020-09-01 15:44:21,ikmkxx,White Chicks is comedic perfection. I will go to the grave thinking that. I watch it no less than 5 times a year I'd wager.

Baby Boomers 1941-1959 (first to enter school after WWII ended to last being born in a United States with less than 50 states)

Gen X 1960-1978: First to be born in a United States like today to last graduating college in the 20th century

Millennials: 1979-1997: First to graduate college in the 21st century and the last to spend four years of college on campus

3689,2020-09-01 17:28:39,ikfnvk,"True. Even though I wouldn't argue for this organization of generations, I still liked reading one possible interpretation of how certain years could be grouped together."
3690,2020-09-02 00:03:49,ikfnvk,"I know that, but I actually like this generational grouping. Makes all generations 18-19 years is very balanced, compared to making it very short as 15-16 or less years or making it very long like 21-22+ years. It makes things easier for everyone else instead of all this confusion. But at the same time, this is all arbitrary. I know that we are not really millennials at the end of the day, especially based on how society views millennials and such, but maybe being a millennial is different to another person. Just my two cents."
3691,2020-09-01 07:59:34,ikfnvk,Interesting.
3692,2020-09-10 23:10:09,ikfnvk,What's wrong with that? I was just listing a bunch of celebrities born around that time.
3693,2020-09-01 07:43:39,ikfnvk,"I dont think ""first who cant possibly remember"" or ""last who can possibly remember"" something are good markers to mark a generation. I mean it is very likely a three or four year old would not remember the political importance of these events. They may not even know who this Kennedy is until like years after he died. 1961 might have memories prior to Kennedy's death.  I am sure many 1959 and 1960 borns would not remember Kennedy's death. Many 1995-1998 dont even remember 9/11. 2015-2017 though can end up remembering a world before coronavirus 15 years from now, even though they may not know what coronavirus is.

3694,2020-09-01 07:52:21,ikfnvk,"Not bad. It's just shifted over four years earlier.

Instead of this:
Boomer: 1946-1964
Gen X: 1965-1983
Gen Y: 1984-2002
Gen Z: 2003-2021

It's this:

Gen Y: 1980-1998
Gen Z: 1999-2017"
3695,2020-09-01 07:58:57,ikfnvk,"The 1961-1979 and 1980-1998 definitions aren't that uncommon actually. Many people want to begin gen y at 1980 since it's the first 80s year, so whenever they also apply the 18 year span, it ends up being 1980-1998. You barely ever see 1942-1960 and 1999-2017 though."
3696,2020-09-01 08:09:10,ikfnvk,"I prefer the ranges next to: instead of this rather than its this. Makes no sense for 1960 to be gatekept from the other two early 60s years. You even said 1980 should be start of millennials since it is the first 80s year. First half of the 60s is gen jones anyways. 

I have seen 1945-1959 as a baby boomer definition. 

Then 1960-1979. 

1980-1999 is one of the most agreeable millennial definitions I have come across. It is my favorite actually. 

I am not keen on when Gen Z ends though.

I have seen 1998-2016. Never 1999-2017 though. People would prefer stating X in 1960 if 1964 or 1965 is too late, since the first three years of the 60s are the full early 60s years, just like how you said 1980 should be y as it is the first 80s year. People prefer 1982 over 1980 as the millennial start date though."
3698,2020-09-01 08:01:55,ikfnvk,"First of all, I have never seen 1961-1979 and I seen 1942-1960, with the exception of 1942, so 1943-1960. I have seen 1980-1998 (though I feel that most start Y in 1980 cause it is the first 80s year like ending it in 1994 or 1999 for the same numerical reason. I have seen 1999-2017 in a way, maybe excluding 2017, so 1999-2016."

3701,2020-08-31 22:48:03,ik7e7d,"There is no coherent woke ideology and you shouldn’t search for one or engage with supporters as though there is one. It’s a consequence of disseminating 100s (many fringe) of theoretical works that make wild metaphysical socio-political claims based on a specific analytical lens, teaching and approaching that lens as though it were a priori fact, and creating a lite version easily consumed by the masses. 

Standpoint theory is fundamentally capitalist. Hayek basically invented it to argue against centralized economic planning and its intrinsic inability to account for ‘particular’ moments in space and time that localized markets could adequately respond to."
3702,2020-08-31 22:38:55,ik7e7d,">Those who are familiar with the ""internalised discrimination"" argument will know how this format works - effectively, if there is a problematic representative of a favoured group, they're just a bad representative (or even non-representative), and so their views will not have the same epistemic weight as a genuine diverse ""voice"".

Any way we could exploit this contradiction to explain the lie that idpol is?"

3704,2020-08-31 22:46:18,ik7e7d,"I would start by exposing the shallowness of the phrase ""listen to the experiences and voices of minorities"". Because while wokies often push for increased racial diversity, it is trojan horse in the sense that it is used in the hopes that a more ""progressive"" point of view will be pushed into the conversation. However, if minorities are going off script and saying something different, then all of a sudden their voices aren't the right ones anymore. This suggests that it is not diversity that wokies care about, but conformity - and they're only interested in POC voices as leverage for their own political goals (in other words, tokenism).

Recently, some wokies have criticised the practice of white people citing, say, Thomas Sowell, Clarence Thomas or MLK in defence of their attacks on idpol, claiming it is a form of tokenism. But this is the exact behaviour they engage in, as analysed above (they just pretend it is some sort of virtue)."

Good point, a lot of this is just posturing so that (white) liberals can continue their leadership role in the otherwise multiethnic, socially conservative coalition that is the DNC. Hopefully there's a way to explain this that doesn't sound like stupid Republican ""plantation theory""."

3768,2020-08-30 21:47:21,ijkyax,"I think the negativity toward ""All Lives Matter"" is more about the fact that we really need to focus on the black community right now. Especially in America. It doesn't negate the fact that all lives do matter and that there is prejudice against other races but we as a nation have been most especially intolerant and unsympathetic to the black community. This issue affects how us white people feel about anyone we see as different. IMO If we can finally STOP this practice of 'us' and 'them', we can stop all of it."
3769,2020-08-30 22:38:44,ijkyax,"White liberals have ressurected the ""white mans burden"" where they think they're the only ones smart  enough to solve the black mans ailments."
3770,2020-08-30 22:46:19,ijkyax,"Extreme liberals are some of the most brainwashed people I've ever seen and it's depressing. I'm not saying republicans can't be this way, some are, but there are definitely more uninformed, ""young and dumb"" liberals than there are republicans."
3771,2020-08-30 21:42:39,ijkyax,"While I don't support the whole all lives matter bullshit, It's just another time a celebrity said some thing silly. I wouldn't call him anti-black."

3773,2020-08-30 22:21:31,ijkyax,I don't care. I honestly don't give a shit about that news.
3774,2020-08-30 21:50:54,ijkyax,I think Terry Crews is awesome.

3776,2020-08-30 22:28:08,ijkyax,"Maybe he should have responded ""Fine, you win:  Lives don't matter.  Happy now?"""
3777,2020-08-30 22:29:20,ijkyax,Terry Crews did not tweet this.
3778,2020-08-30 22:32:50,ijkyax,"He seems genuine, with everything going on I think a lot of people are being led to the fringes of each side. Which is basically just hating others based on their race or beliefs. Terry was trying to be accepting of all races in what is an extremely complex issue and anytime you involve yourself with issues like this people are going to be upset if you are not parroting exactly what they are saying."
3779,2020-08-30 22:50:06,ijkyax,"As a german I'm very confused about the slogans you use. To me ""All Lives"" includes ""Black Lives"", but for some reason saying that ""All Lives Matter"" also says that it's wrong to protest against police violence against black people?

I am insanely confused."
3780,2020-08-30 22:32:44,ijkyax,"Being black doesn't mean you can't be against black interests. I don't know Terry Crews and I don't know what he meant by it. But surely, it doesn't seem like he understands that All Live Matter is a disrespectful response.

Black people started Black Lives Matter to say black people have issues that need addressing. When you say, All Lives Matter, you're essentially saying well we all have problems so shut up your not special."
3781,2020-08-30 21:32:07,ijkyax,Seems ignorant. On all sides. Including posting it here. Isn't this like 6months ago? Didn't we already discuss this in like 50 posts. Go find those and tell me why they don't answer your question.
3782,2020-08-30 21:36:51,ijkyax,I think a persons intended message should be taken more seriously in arguments like this. A person saying “all lives matter” just to tear down BLM shouldn’t be put in the same category as a person saying “all lives matter” when expressing how important it is to focus on the goal of equality so that one race isn’t once again treated better than another.
3783,2020-08-30 22:50:50,ijkyax,"While I think his use of the phrase “all lives matter” was wrong because there is a lot of inequality and mistreatment of black people in the US, I think the media has severely perpetuated the issue of BLM and spread blatant misinformation and slanderous language in articles for no reason that has cost the lives of many people!

EDIT: So I understand the use of “all lives matter” because all lives are being targeted and lost because of these riots and people rightfully trying to defend them self against violent people... like Kyle Rittenhouse rightfully defended himself but somehow to the media, he’s a ‘white supremacist’. He did NOTHING illegal, yet is faced with a number of charges (all he is innocent of) and his life ruined because of the shitty media. He also has some weird ass prison group which is funded by a leftist organisation, trying to locate him to kill him. A 17yr old innocent kid has a hit on him. Disgusting. 
I am NOT opposed to the protests, that are peaceful just the riots and looters!

Sorry for the little rant... it just pisses me off how the media gets away with LITERAL MURDER and nobody cares!"
3784,2020-08-30 21:42:34,ijkyax,"..all lives do matter, for some reason this statement has been interpreted as racist, if a proud, black man like terry crewes says it, why can't it just be accepted at face value?"
3785,2020-08-30 21:47:47,ijkyax,"As I lay here in my dimly lit room, window opened, my clothes still on, reading reddit posts late at night, and being an individual who hasn't heard of this predicament yet, I wonder to myself. Humans should have a working pair of brains. It is a well-known fact that Terry Crews is a black American male celebrity. If one should make a statement about ""all the lives"" on earth, everyone conceiving that statement is save to assume that the person in question meant every single living human on earth, which includes all races, sexuality's and religious backgrounds. Therefore a statement involving the words ""all lives matter"" is most likely not excluding the black lives. And if Terry Crews states that indeed ""all lives matter"", he meant to include those black lives. This statement is within this context not to be seen as ""anti-black"".

Also, on the matter of ""anti-black"" behaviour, if one were to be a racist they would have a fear and/or hate against that particular race. If one were to actually be a part of the race they fear and/or hate this would be considered a mental problem most likely come forth as self-deprication and weird anxiety problems. They would not be deemed mentally stable enough to actually make lasting statement about any cultural group and thus ""anti-black"" behaviour against one-self would be considered not realistic and therefore non-existent.


*Alrighty peoples! That was me having a little fun with what I see as a clear mockery of real racism-problems. I also am Dutch and English is not my first language so if you see any spelling mistakes, let me know! But for real, which person actually told a black person he was being racist against his own skin-color? Like, come on people! We have real problems here! Real racism, corona, wars, etc., etc. No really! Who said it? I want to have a laugh.*"

3789,2020-08-30 21:46:27,ijkyax,A lot of black people were against him too after all that black supremacy bullshit he was on.
3790,2020-08-30 22:16:24,ijkyax,My opinion is that you are looking at exceptional cases of behavior and then pretending that behavior applies to a large group you want to smear.  I find that reprehensible.
3791,2020-08-30 23:00:07,ijkyax,"Terry is probably unaware that ""all lives matter"" is a favorite slogan of alt-right racists to discredit black lives matter"

3793,2020-08-30 23:47:38,ijkyax,I think people should be outraged when someone is being kinda racist

3795,2020-08-30 21:44:15,ijkyax,So.. Not all lives matter? That's racist lol

3798,2020-08-30 23:53:21,ijkyax,We say black lives so the focus is on black lives

3800,2020-08-30 21:38:48,ijkyax,Terry is black... You think he doesn't care for black people?...
3801,2020-08-30 23:59:32,ijkyax,If people scream all lives matter at a protest then the focus is on all lives instead of lives that are being discriminated against
3802,2020-08-30 23:01:39,ijkyax,The phrase was coined by Martin Luther King ffs...
3803,2020-08-30 23:53:10,ijkyax,"The ones I've met have been far more respectful, and informed than the liberals I've met. I'm not generalizing republicans or liberals, but that's just what I've seen."
3804,2020-08-30 21:45:10,ijkyax,Not really. Please keep up with the concepts when it comes to talking about racism.
3805,2020-08-31 00:07:03,ijkyax,They are part of humanity. So all of humanity might as well be killing itself off.
3806,2020-08-31 00:06:59,ijkyax,"Yeah, I get why people say Black Lives Matter, I just don't get the ""All Lives Matter"" part. All Lives Matter to me means all lives matter equally, so why don't they protest against racialy motivated police violence together with the BLM groups? That's the part that confuses me. Why that specific slogan is used by groups opposing BLM, not by ones supporting it."
3807,2020-08-30 21:46:47,ijkyax,"No, I apologize, I should’ve worded that better. I don’t believe Terry is against black people or BLM. I do think that he believes that with the way some activists are acting, it’s soon to turn into black lives being more important than all lives. I basically think he’s right"
3808,2020-08-31 00:06:12,ijkyax,"..asians, hispanics and arabs face discrimination too, the problem is people on the right, who don't give a fuck about black people being murdered by police, have co-opted ""all lives matter"" as a way to downplay the discrimination black people face, but at its heart all lives matter includes black people, its a message of collectiveness, especially important when key figures in the blm movement make anti-semetic remarks."
3809,2020-08-30 23:52:08,ijkyax,Definitely not.
3810,2020-08-30 23:02:59,ijkyax,It's not the 60's ffs

3814,2020-08-31 00:25:43,ijkyax,..it would be part of the focus.
3815,2020-08-31 01:14:32,ijkyax,It would be kinda weird to say alm then have the whole movement about black people instead of all people

3821,2020-08-28 04:54:17,ii0scc,"Agreed. 

Good people, or good pr; but as with any celebrities, they're worshipped to no end and it's frustrating."
3822,2020-08-28 05:02:04,ii0scc,Reddit straight up worships these dudes and it's kinda weird. I know how they act in front of a camera but I don't know HOW they act so I can't just assume that they're all wHolEsoMe 100 people.
3823,2020-08-28 05:12:58,ii0scc,"I have always thought it was a joke. What does PR mean, btw?"
3824,2020-08-28 05:17:57,ii0scc,"I’m somewhat new on here so I guess I haven’t seen the massive idolization for these guys, but personally I think at least the idea of these guys is good. I like the wholesomeness and I think watching Mr.Rogers / Bob Ross has been just good for just humbling myself, idk. If I see bad things come out about them I’ll be disappointed but not surprised considering how disgusting Hollywood is."

3827,2020-08-28 00:16:19,ihvida,I don’t like what that guy said about Terry Crews anymore than y’all but saying “fuck that guy” isn’t the Terry Crews way. Terry’s all about love and respect not saying “fuck that guy”.
3828,2020-08-28 16:39:35,ihvida,Amazing thread
3829,2020-08-28 00:09:16,ihvida,Fuck the guy that said fuck Terry Crews. All my homies hate the guy whose homies all hate Terry Crews.

Congrats you’re turning the subreddit into a high school cafeteria.

I’m unsubbin. Don’t need to be in some weird community to know I like me some Crews."

3842,2020-08-28 16:13:08,ihvida,This sub is so weird. They ignore what the black community says about Terry but ironically might support BLM
3843,2020-08-28 18:51:12,ihvida,"The funniest thing about this is that it's all white folks who love a black man because he dances on his Instagram and cracks jokes....

Meanwhile black folks have lost any respect for him they might have had. Don't get me wrong, he's played some entertaining characters, but in real life he ain't for the people. 

Instead of CrewsCrew this shold be Gym Crow's Coons. 

Yall should have learned by now not to put celebrities up on a pedestal. They are no more moral or intelligent than they average guy on the street."

You sound like a klan member in disguise doing your best to spread hate in any case, if you don't have a more valuable target than Terry for your bullshit then that says it all about what kind of person you actually are."

3871,2020-08-28 13:50:13,ihvida,"See, now this is some quality trolling.

We looking at a supposed ""revolution"" of identifying and respecting challenges of black men and women in America.  We are unifying under the ideology that black experience matters, black voices need to be heard not edited or interpreted, and that we need to start appreciating their input to American society.

But there are still people who think it's okay to use terms from slavery times to refer to a black man speaking his mind because they don't like it.  This is some crazy shit.  Not only that, they are branding him a race traitor like some kind of kindergartener.  What's next, we publish ""the official Black opinion"" and rip away our Black Lives Matter badges from blacks if they don't repeat it?

Talk about one step forward, two steps back."

3878,2020-08-28 21:46:41,ihvida,Hot take but you people would have called MLK an Uncle Tom if he was alive today
3879,2020-08-28 01:37:47,ihvida,"NO! There's something I wanna know from Mr.-I-Hate-Terry-Crews. If you hate Terry Crews, why do you know so much about him?!"
3880,2020-08-28 10:59:12,ihvida,"Like, with his consent?

I mean, you might as well ask, he may be up for that"
3881,2020-08-28 00:29:25,ihvida,I figured it was a joke and you’re right Terry would respect your right to say fuck that guy.
3882,2020-08-27 23:35:09,ihvida,Clearly he can’t handle the Crews
3883,2020-08-27 23:15:31,ihvida,Hmmmmm... Maybe Old Spice wasn't strong enough for him.... Or maybe he's just jealous. 🤷‍♀️

3897,2020-08-28 16:03:56,ihvida,"not so fun fact: Uncle Tom became a derogatory term because the incredibly popular stage play version of Uncle Tom's Cabin changed his character. Instead of saving the two girls, he sells them out.

It's not that people ""don't read the book"" but rather that powerful white people at the time made the conscious decision to corrupt a strong Black character"
3898,2020-08-28 16:18:13,ihvida,I read the book. I referring of course to the co-opted play version of the character.

It’ll get lost in the hive mind, but his bullshit on Twitter about “black supremacy” and not supporting and doing a press tour trying to discredit Gabrielle Unions allegations of a hostile work environment.

3906,2020-08-30 09:51:22,ihvida,"Lol don’t speak for all of us with your garbage opinion, that’s just you and whatever twitter screeching gang y’all represent. The only reason magic city is getting defended is because: 

1.	It’s an iconic strip club for rappers and even got listed as a “strip club every rapper must go to” -- Sports Magazine 

2.	It’s black owned and people think he’s a “new coon” (see:Rick Ross) for speaking out against it rather than black lives matter. 

Terry crews attacked magic city for its rumored controversy surrounding sex trafficking and abuse along with pimping, which that in itself isn’t too weird. Is it hard to believe that strip clubs aren’t the most ethical places?"

This sub just likes to bury its head in the sand and pretend like he’s the character he plays. Dude’s an asshole and his stans are worse.
3921,2020-08-28 16:08:09,ihvida,Yeah it's really messed up. [Here's an interview with a folklorist about how that happened and why it's important](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=93059468)
3922,2020-08-29 00:30:50,ihvida,You just did you fucking moron.
3923,2020-08-31 07:38:11,ihvida,Yes
3924,2020-08-28 09:24:26,ihvida,I mean he’s done some really questionable shit in the past- most recent one that I can think of is going on a trip to China (and possibly sponsored during it but I can’t remember 100% so don’t quote me on that) when the HK protests were happening and anti-China sentiment was lower than usual. There was also his comments about children needing an active father figure in regards to same-sex couples (which you can agree with but the way he said it doesn’t help his case) and I’m sure there’s more that he’s done that I either can’t think of or don’t know about
3925,2020-08-28 18:40:02,ihvida,Who cares  about Gabrielle Union?
3926,2020-08-28 09:41:22,ihvida,"The China thing I agree it's a debatable subject. The other events I admit I don't know much about. I just know that the same-sex couple event started form a tweet (iirc). Imo tweets are the worst medium to send a message because you have very little space to express a thought. If that thought is a complex one, like the same-sex couples example, expressing it on Twitter is the worst thing someone could do because there's little to no chance your message will be delivered as you want it, even if the person has good intentions. Maybe if he expressed that, say, in a talk show, where he could contextualize more his words, it wouldn't have gotten so heated up."
3927,2020-08-28 20:22:43,ihvida,Not Terry Crews.
3928,2020-08-28 09:44:35,ihvida,I’d say the China thing is less debatable than the father figure one. He’d went at the worst possible opportunity- it’d be like... well going to China now I guess- or Russia during the Cold War (but obviously not as extreme) by the public it was seen as conversing with the ‘enemy’ especially with his promotional tags on his posts.
3929,2020-08-27 21:21:50,ihtqdw,"So this seems a bit edgy. Maybe instead of a blanket ""Fuck Terry Crews"", you drop by the thread and add meaningful content.

You could go with something like ""I really liked Terry Crews in Brooklyn 99, but I really hate yogurt. I hate yogurt so much that I don't even like people that like yogurt. Terry Crews is the most prolific yogurt lover of all time - and for that - Fuck Terry Crews.""

I personally would disagree with you and question your reasoning, but at least that would add meaningful content to the subreddit."

3934,2020-08-27 21:39:41,ihtqdw,"Okay, but, actually, why?"

Also one time it was my boss. She asked me about some work that had to be done, and I took my time to write off this really detailed email. It took me 45 minutes to get it right. She just replied with

great

That hurt me for the rest of the day.

Two nights ago I hurt myself, when I decided to eat Chipotle twice in the same day. I was on that toilet for hours. Running from the bed to the toilet at 3 a.m.

That's all I can think of right nah.

4019,2020-08-27 18:28:33,ihphzk,Yes.
4020,2020-08-27 19:04:49,ihphzk,Idk about y’all but I’ve been saying he’s a coon lol
4021,2020-08-27 20:11:19,ihphzk,I think he trolling at this point
4022,2020-08-27 18:35:14,ihphzk,Can somebody give me the breakdown on what he means by this and why it's detrimental to the black community specifically? I've been seeing people talk about it but nobody has explained why
4023,2020-08-27 23:34:00,ihphzk,I’m confused as to how this could be interpreted as “cooning”. I doubt any white supremacist would link decreasing strip clubs to the increase of black love. This is just a dumb statement by someone who happens to be black.
4024,2020-08-28 00:10:25,ihphzk,Ain’t his wife white tho.
4025,2020-08-28 04:06:24,ihphzk,Are you fucking serious?!?!
4026,2020-09-05 13:34:57,ihphzk,wassup with this dude?!
4027,2020-08-28 09:11:13,ihphzk,"Because he wants to boycott a strip club? However ridiculous or stupid this tweet is, it is ridiculous to call him a coon. 

Lets be clear. A coon is black person who has internalized anti-blackness so much that they are willing to sellout their own to get in good graces with whiteness. It is suppose to mean something when you call someone a coon, this term is synonymous with 'sell out' or 'uncle tom', You dont get to call Terry Crews a coon because he wants to boycott a strip club. This is insane."
4028,2020-08-27 20:40:52,ihphzk,lol exactly. black delegation been traded him off the team
4029,2020-08-27 19:09:05,ihphzk,"All this shit going on and he focuses on closing a strip club. A black-owned businesses that employs many black women.  

There's also the hashtag, which is problematic because... it has nothing to do with the tweet. It implies strip clubs are in opposition to love. It's also hypocritical: where's your love for the people who work at the club and need it open to survive financially?"
4030,2020-08-27 18:43:51,ihphzk,[deleted]
4031,2020-08-28 00:12:22,ihphzk,I guess the timing. How tf do you choose this timing to talk about a random af topic and distract from all the shit that just went down. Like that’s what’s on your mind bro? Everytime it’s this with this guy.
4032,2020-08-28 13:06:57,ihphzk,Yeah you’re right dude it’s just about this. This one thing. This one time. That’s all we’re taking into account /s
4033,2020-08-27 19:21:08,ihphzk,"Ok, this makes a lot more sense. I didn’t know the club was black owned. So I’m guessing he hasn’t said anything about the police brutality thing at all? I get why people would be tired of him. He’s always finding himself in these controversies where it almost seems like he’s going out of his way to annoy black people"
4034,2020-08-27 18:45:57,ihphzk,"Teams? Wait what? I thought this was about a strip club... Or are you saying that Crews is kinda making a little pun that means “hey, instead of boycotting the NBA, why don’t we boycott Magic City”? I’m extra confused now"
4035,2020-08-28 00:35:59,ihphzk,"Lol I get all that I just hate the over use of the word when used to describe literally any and everything Terry Crews, Kanye, Candace Owens etc do. At this point one of them could say “when I was a teen I used to get Colt 45 from this one corner whenever we had house parties I still sip it every once in awhile to take me back to the good times” and the Internet would be like “shut up coon you only talking about that cause it got 45 in the title & we all know that’s yo daddy”. Some niggas might just got a taste for nasty malt liquor damn 😂😂😂"
4036,2020-08-28 15:07:14,ihphzk,"Hang on, you're the one who singled out this incident as a threshold beyond which we should call him a coon. You can elaborate which is fine but you set the constraints here not me."
4037,2020-08-27 19:31:24,ihphzk,"I assume he said nothing, given what his priorities seem to be."
4038,2020-08-28 01:52:34,ihphzk,I would be real suspicious of any of the people you mentioned if they were sitting around reminiscing about sipping Colt 45 - especially depending on their audience at the time
4039,2020-08-28 00:38:48,ihphzk,Lol I mean everyone you mentioned are they wrong though 🤷🏾‍♂️. It does get used too much though.
4040,2020-08-28 03:46:20,ihphzk,😂😂😂
4041,2020-08-28 04:11:28,ihphzk,"I mean what I’d say is someone can be “coonin” in a moment or something they say but not everything. The first time I ever heard about the 13th amendment loophole was from Kanye’s crazy tmz interview,  and I love his music. Doesn’t stop me from pointing out the moments he’s coonin. Not too many people I’d straight up call a coon besides Candice owners and some of these mags I just saw at the rnc lol. Terry crews just gettin a little too sus right now though haha."
4042,2020-08-28 00:58:33,ihphzk,"Lol true but I’ve heard all three of those people say things that made me go “hmmm this would make for an interesting conversation” but because of that word the conversation centers around that. That Terry Crews/Don Lemmon interview could’ve sparked a convo on the BLM “movement” vs BLM “organization. What are black peoples views on the organizations “mission statement”? Instead it was more “he’s a just a coon” talk on every black podcast (that I listen to). It’s gets boring, create some compelling content for the audience."
4043,2020-08-28 09:19:39,ihphzk,"Candace Owens certainly isnt a coon. She runs an organisation with an explicitly black agenda. This organisation even raised over $100,000 in emergency aid to only black businesses destroyed by looters. If people like you and me disagree with her that black empowerment is to be found through conservatism and voting Trump over Biden, that doesnt make her a coon. She will then argue to you that every city blacks are doing worst is ran by democrats, we just have to debunk her arguments rather than say actually....She doesnt give a fuck about the black community and is in collaboration with white supremacists."
4044,2020-08-28 13:26:09,ihphzk,"Oh didn’t see this first before replying to your message otherwise I wouldn’t have bothered replying to it. If Candace Owens, who routinely pushes a white supremacist agenda, sued her high school over discrimination but then turns around and lies and says she has never experienced racism and that systematic racism doesn’t exist, and who with other white supremacists attacked George Floyd’s character as if it relates to his death, and someone who spreads a narrative that the reason why black people are struggling is because of fatherlessness, due to their own decisions (because she read Thomas so well, who every white supremacist uses as a shield to throw out wild racist beliefs). She is a grifter, I dunno if she plays ignorant or got lost in the grift along the way but someone who routinely spouts a white supremacist for an agenda is definitely above my bar for “coonin”."
4045,2020-08-28 14:56:26,ihphzk,"Candace Owen's agenda is very clearly a black empowerment agenda. The fact that you and I don't like her or agree with a great many of the things she says doesn't give us the liberty to re-define her agenda into a goddamn white supremacist agenda, especially as she runs a non profit organisation dedicated to black lives. Also its kinda lame of you to hold her to the standards of her beliefs in high school, a lawsuit in 2007."
4046,2020-08-28 15:27:06,ihphzk,"I’m sorry you’re right. Candace Owens is the quintessential example of black empowerment. Systematic racism doesn’t not exist. Blacks put themselves in poverty and crime due to their own poor decisions and if they pull themselves up by their bootstraps , work harder, stay faithful in their marriages, and stop listening to rap music, they can make it in this country, just like she did. I really loved her take about how Hilters actions in Germany were fine, it was just a problem when he wanted to expand outside of it. I really love the work her organization PragerU is doing. She’s right, George Floyd deserved to die because he was a horrible person and George Soros paid blm to protest his killing. I now believe the pandemic is fake due to her tweets, I can’t believe I’ve been worrying this whole time. Thanks for bringing me to the light."
4047,2020-08-28 16:21:34,ihphzk,"Nothing in my comments speak to Candace Owens being anything resembling a quintessential example of black empowerment. I think Candace Owens sucks (for the most part)

Your synopisis of Candace's belief on the downfall of black america is correct except you miss out one significant point that she blames democrats for sabotaging black america in addition to personal responsibility.

The claim that Candace Owens a) supports Hitler and b) believes George Floyd deserved to die is a strawman. I agree that her conspiracy theories about George Sorros are crazy though lmao. She also refers to Geroge Sorros as a 'democratic plant' loool,"

I was certain at any moment he would yell 'Allah Akbar'. Thankfully, my shopping cart was full of bacon (which as you all know, is Mooslem kryptonite). So I straightened my MAGA hat and pulled up my Confederate flag britches and grabbed a pack of bacon from my cart. I took that Mooslem over my knee and spanked his ass with the bacon while screaming 'Liberalism is a mental disorder!' over and over. Then, by the power of the bacon,  Abdul-Mohammed-Jamal-Jabar-Steve-Jabar-Omar-Abdul instantly converted to Christianity and registered as a Republican. Trump showed up and awarded me the Medal of Honor because I probably stopped the next 9/11.

Terry Spice feats include: 

Having his brain leave his head only to explode and the only side effects were Terry lost the ability to speak English. 

Using his own head as a bowling ball, putting it back on his body, only to have it be removed again with absolutely no side effects.

He can force himself into other commercials.

He can rearrange his physical body at will, from growing an extra arm from a bicep or becoming as large as a skyscraper.

Those are the only ones I can think of, but I remember Segata losing to zombies at one point. Ain’t no way my man Terry Spice takin an L, unless he wanted to."

4154,2020-10-04 02:00:00,j4qsj2,"I have done a lot of study in this for my own self to figure out what it means to be a man, especially in this day and age.

I want to open with saying that no person is perfect and often times the ones we look up to so much are also the ones that have the greatest pitfalls. However, we can acknowledge their faults and still commend them of their strengths.

I am a big fan of the following men:

Chuck Close: A painter famous for his photo realistic works. He became paralyzed after a seizure but would still paint during his physical therapy. He soon was making mosaic portraits. Truly an incredible look at perseverance and passion.

Jack London: lived a full life even though he died at 40. Man was the embodiment of an adventurous spirit.

Viktor Frankl: Psychologist and Holocaust survivor that wrote the book, ‘Man’s Search for Meaning.’ This is an important book on the existentialist philosophy.

Teddy Roosevelt: Passionate, wise, and gritty. A man that showed power and brains and how to wrestle life into submission.

John Muir: ‘Father of the National Park.’ Muir was persistent on preserving the wonderful natural world around us.

Joseph Lister: Showed that having a curious and inquisitive mind can save the world. His research is crucial in dropping the mortality rate due to sterile surgeries.

Dwight Eisenhower: Every position he took on, he excelled with conviction and purpose.

Stevie Wonder: Shows that life has meaning in the struggle. Even his blindness did not stop him from sharing his love for music.

John Wooden: “Wizard of Westwood.” A humble man with on of the winningest careers in NCAA history.

Louis Zamperini: refused doom and despair when many would have. He also showed mercy to his enemies. Former Olympian that was shot down in WW2, lost at see for 47 days in shark infested waters, shot at by Japanese soldiers, taken as a PoW and tortured regularly. He eventually forgave those that hurt him.

There are many more men but I’ll stop here. Again, they all have faults. They are human. If they did not have struggles or faults then we would have a harder time relating to them. Hope this was helpful!"
4155,2020-10-04 04:58:38,j4qsj2,New models of manhood. John Krasinski. Ryan Reynolds. Hugh Jackman. Keanu. Chadwick All of them are just genuine honest and kind.

Really helped me appreciate and love my own body and develop my masculinity around myself and not anyone else! 

Fashion wise, Harry Styles. He’s just so confident and expresses himself however he wants which I admire. It’s encouraged me to play with different styles I like without fear. 

Personality wise, Stephen Curry. He’s so humble and family-man and is also a man of faith. In this society seeing those things being respected has helped me take pride in those qualities and stay genuine and kind because those are manly qualities too!"

Both my grandpa and my dad are very progressive people, also when it comes to the way they live their marriage. For example my grandpa is 88 and I've never heard him yell at my grandma or order her around. He treats her super respectfully and even gives her hugs and kisses in front of other people. It's clear he loves her very much. He also vacuums and cooks dinner for my grandma sometimes. His meals aren't the best but the fact that he does these things is still very unusual for his generation. I've seen many other men his age who just sit around and let their wife take care of all the house chores.

My dad, too, has always taken a very active role around the house. While he does typical ""manly"" tasks such as repairing the house, he also cooks, does the dishes, vacuums, cleans the bathroom and stuff like that. His cooking is even better than that of my mom.

My dad is also very untypical for a man of his generation because he's not one of those stereotypical boomers. For example his political opinions are super informed and progressive and he has a lot of empathy for the young generation. I've never heard him say dumb stuff like: ""young people are lazy"".

Another thing I've always admired and greatly appreciated about my dad is the way he handles his emotions. Although he expresses them openly (verbally), he's always been a very soft-spoken man. One of the most important values he taught me was to treat other people with kindness, tolerance and respect. He did this by being a great model; I've almost never seen him raise his voice. Maybe once or twice in my whole childhood. Although he could be quite strict at times, he was never unfair or mean. I've always felt respected and taken seriously by him. Even when my mom freaks out during fights and goes too far (for example by mildly hitting him), he always remains calm and never holds any grudges. There was only one single time I remember him cursing at her, when she threw a heavy metal box at his face and it hit him just half an inch away from his eye, very nearly causing a grave injury.

My dad has always believed in listening to people, trying to understand them and giving them the benefit of the doubt EVEN IF they've done things that should piss you off. Not because being nice is so cool but because treating each other with kindness and respect is the only way we can ever get to a place of peace and harmony in this world. I love his attitude because a lot of people who preach kindness to others are actual total pricks themselves but my dad is the opposite. He doesn't openly preach these things to anyone but by treating others right, he taught me empathy, respect and many other things."

All these people taught me to not give a fuck about what anyone thinks of you. It’s okay to have feelings and show your emotions, wear whatever clothes you want, paint your nails, get piercings, get tattoos, wear jewelry, live free and how you want to. 

But they also taught me to respect people and treat everyone equally to not be a piece of shit like some of them write their music about or talk about. 

I’m very into fashion and these guys also helped me find my own personal style and get the confidence to try whatever I wanted and even if I didn’t think I rocked it to have the confidence to let everyone know I don’t care what you think of me I’m doing this for myself. 

Without these people idk if I would’ve gotten through some of the hardest parts of my life. They helped me know I wasn’t alone with how I felt, the issues I have going on in my life, and how they have also dealt with mental illness.

4165,2020-10-04 15:29:22,j4qsj2,"**Sir Patrick Stewart** as **Cpt. Jean-Luc Picard** in *Star Trek: Next Generation* was a positive role model for several generations of men (and women). The character is a strong, intelligent man in a position of power and respect, who engages conflict with diplomacy, ony resorting to violence when offered no choice.. He is flawed, but admits his mistakes and actively works on them. He can be biased, but he does not discriminate. He is wise and good, but not perfect - a believable character, but worthy to be idolized. He is also manly, in a traditional sense, but not in a toxic way. 

His most well-known inspirational quote is *""It is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose. That is not a weakness; That is life.""*

The show's 7 seasons are on Netflix in a lot of countries. It's seen as a classic within Science Fiction as a genre, having an arguably bigger impact on popular culture than the original (the one with Bill Shatner as cpt Kirk and Leonard Nimoy as Spock), and there are plenty of ressources online to filter out the relevant episodes if you want to give it a watch without making that big a time commitment (though if you do, you might want to skip most of the first season, which is awful).

Stewart also did four movies, of which the second (*First Contact*) is regarded as the best, exploring deeper themes of the character. Finally, there's a new show being made for Amazon Prime (*Star Trek: Picard,* one season has been released, with two more announced), dealing with old age, what place the character has in a changed world, and with mortality. A lot of fans dislike this one for its darker themes and ambitious storytelling, but I think it works, if seen as a whole."

Help others when you can, take care of yourself and your family, be kind to animals and just generally don’t be an asshole.  How hard is that? What kind of inspiration are you looking for that you need to get it from someone else?

Why do we have to ‘express our masculinity’? Wtf does that even mean? Is rescuing a kitten not masculine? Is carving a pumpkin with your kids not masculine? Is doing your daughters hair not masculine? Is wearing pink not masculine? I would do those things and I don’t give a fuck whether those fall into your descriptions of being ‘masculine’.

I’m actually a little concerned that you feel the need to show teenaged boys how to be men. Everyone is themselves, don’t tell people how or how not to do it. Also, there is not some formula or finish line to ‘being a man’. Congratulations, yesterday you weren’t a man but today you are?

If someone was brave then they were brave, I don’t care if they were male or female, gay or straight, black or white, none of that. That PERSON was brave.

How am I actually different today? I’m not, so how am I supposed to know things and behave differently?

Maybe instead you can focus on good decision making, critical thinking and problems they might encounter. Don’t ride with drunk drivers. Don’t do drugs. Don’t drop out of school. I know those are kind of cliche but track backwards from the bad end result to the causes of the problem. 

Bobby ended up a drug addict. Why? Because he had a terrible home life so instead of talking to someone and getting some support, he tried meth instead.

Susie got pregnant at 16 and screwed up the rest of her life due to it. Why? Because she never learned about birth control.

Billy stole a car, crashed it and killed someone and went to jail? Why? Because someone dared him to.

Janie dropped out of school. Why? Because she didn’t like school. How did that impact her life? With no education she had to work shitty minimum wage jobs her entire life.

Show kids cause and effect. Explain societal pressures ie having sex as a teenager, trying drugs or alcohol. Explain what ‘addiction’ actually means ie your body uncontrollably craves something and you’ll do anything to get money for your next hit. If you try meth today, will you instantly become addicted? Don’t think so? Well that guy with no teeth sleeping beside the dumpster didn’t think he would either but there he is.

I think shock value is underappreciated. I’m in my 50s but I still remember the surprise video they made us watch in Grade 12 just before grad. It was literally videos of car accidents and bodies hanging out of cars. Some people cried and ran out of the school auditorium. Did it have an impact? Yep, I still remember it today. Freaked the shit out of us. You want to reach teens? Take them down to your local skid row and walk around with them. Interview some junkies and find out how they got there.

[Jungleland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW1RAYYs8RI) is a great example of how emotional he gets. In this you not only see Bruce screaming and being vulnerable, but you see a great moment between him and another man (Clarence Clemons on the sax) where they bond as two close friends.

He also had a auto-biopic show on Broadway that was amazing to me. Some of the introductions show a lot about who he is and why. [My Hometown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BSQ2kBWomM&list=PL9tY0BWXOZFs9l_PMss5AB8SD38lFBLwp&index=3) especially provides a backdrop of growing up in a poor family that meant everything to you. The song itself is a sad, reflective tune on how the weight of responsibility is crushing.

Finally, if you want some fucking rock and roll but still relevant, there's my favorite: [The Ghost of Tom Joad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzRbeHyIomk). In that video, he's joined by Tom Morello from Rage Against the Machine. This is where I bring up the poetry aspect of Bruce Springsteen. You'll see it in other songs too, like the first one, but here it's so final. He's describing the life of a man, a world, a feeling where you have nothing except hope.

4301,2020-09-30 23:17:25,j2wd3y,"This was the case for me with running, too. It wasn't like my body was getting tired, but my brain kept telling me I couldn't go on. It didn't understand what I was doing. I had to learn how to trust my body and stop letting myself get worked up over this. 

It's a dangerous game sometimes when you're talking working out and trying to figure out whether it's your brain or body saying no (I've also been hospitalized for rhabdomyolysis), so don't push too hard, but definitely be patient with yourself as your body learns the motions!"
4302,2020-09-30 23:01:28,j2wd3y,Blasting past that first plateau is a big milestone.
4303,2020-09-30 23:30:34,j2wd3y,"I mean, I don't lift, I mostly run (often with weights) and I swim, but yeah that happens all across the board. Took me a couple months to get my act together and start get my mile time down to a 7:30 for running, and now I'm just shedding time faster than ever. Once you get over thar first hill, everything just falls into place."
4304,2020-10-01 00:53:20,j2wd3y,"In the first couple weeks of lifting for a newbie, you’ll see almost no change in muscle size. However, you’ll get stronger very quickly because of something OP alluded to. Your brain is learning to do the movement and learning to fire the muscle correctly. 

Point being, don’t be discouraged if you don’t see much progress in body composition at the start of working out. Give your brain a chance to figure it out and then your muscles with start to grow."
4305,2020-09-30 23:59:06,j2wd3y,"YSK if you want to start lifting, you should have started a while ago so you better start now, because tomorrow you'll be kicking yourself for taking so long to figure it out"
4306,2020-10-01 00:50:57,j2wd3y,"You think your strong until you isolate a muscle and find that your bicep alone can't lift 5 lbs. 

And I'm a very big guy. Almost never worked out a day in my life but still huge. Pretty embarrassing when I went to the gym and old men are out lifting me."
4307,2020-10-01 00:05:45,j2wd3y,"Will say that in my experience do not feel like anyone at the gym is judging you. We all started at some point, and we all remember what that we like. If anything I found the gym community to be very accepting."
4308,2020-10-01 01:30:52,j2wd3y,"YSK that this is psychologically correct and much deeper than just lifting weights as well. For instance when teaching a child, you can scream at them and scream at them to get them to stop screaming, but in the end, you're teaching them to scream in that type of situation. That also means that as an adult, trying to change a behavior that was so engrained in you as a child will take that same amount of dedication, and change will always be made through repetition."
4309,2020-09-30 23:37:40,j2wd3y,"I haven't lifted since high school, but I will never forget how oddly pleasing it feels for your muscle to be sore.

You are sore, it does emphasize with movement, but the soreness always felt like it was ""good pain."" Some people hated it, but my lifting partner and I would emphasize that we go in there to hurt our muscles, because the aftermath feels amazing.

Just talking about it makes me wanna spend my next social security check on a dumbell or 2."
4310,2020-10-01 02:32:12,j2wd3y,How does one get started lifting in their own house? And by starting I mean from 0.
4311,2020-10-01 01:07:22,j2wd3y,Basically your nervous system isn’t used to the stress and it has to adjust.
4312,2020-10-01 02:02:32,j2wd3y,I'm a noob with all this stuff. Does what you're saying apply to body weight training too like press-ups and chin-ups?
4313,2020-10-01 02:32:04,j2wd3y,"Hey! PT student here. What you said is mostly true. The first 6 weeks your biggest weight lifting growth is due to neurological changes. This could be due to better recruiting of motor neurons as well as reduced golgi tendon reflex. The motor neurons are recruited in a better way so that you can lift more weight. The golgi tendon bodies are a set of reflexes that react to large stress loads that will trigger a reflex for your antagonistic muscles to fire to cause you to not put excessive force on your muscles that you are using. With repeated weight lifting your body gets better at getting bigger and faster muscle cells to fire quicker, as well as get your body to accept putting excessive stress into your joints."
4314,2020-10-01 00:53:35,j2wd3y,"This is genius. I’ve totally felt that way. 

When your brain finally catches up, it’s nice to feel strong and powerful."
4315,2020-10-01 02:03:46,j2wd3y,Thanks man really. I’m underweight and tried working out at home and had the exact same thing happen to me so I gave up and now I’m starting gym from next month(last few weeks were really good for me) I’ve got enough motivation and courage but this advice will help me persist. Thank you. 🙏

4319,2020-10-01 13:42:47,j2wd3y,"Please do not ""use the same weight over and over again"". If you did 10x50kg bench press one week, go for 55kg the next week.
NEVER STAY ON THE SAME WEIGHT.

Some time ago i joined a new gym after a loong break from the gym, im naturally really skinny.

I joined and met some guys (jumped on the bench between their sets). So i felt really week could barely do 3 sets of 10 for 50kg bench press. (I was probably like 70kg myself back then). 

I stuck to my workout. Increasing weight each week around 5kg. (I went down to 5 sets of 5 reps).

So moving on 3 months, i see these same guys. Doing what? 60kg bench press. Exactly like last time. They did 60kg bench press of 10 reps for 3 months. Even know they have could added the 5kg or even 2.5kg but why push yourself? At that time i was able to do 80kg around 6-7reps. They could not do a single rep."
4320,2020-10-01 01:50:47,j2wd3y,Explains why I was hitting the bench with 10s on when I first started and a couple of months later I was up to a plate on each side.
4321,2020-10-01 02:11:53,j2wd3y,Something I really needed to read. Thanks so much!
4322,2020-10-01 02:23:05,j2wd3y,"I'm a woman and I absolutely love lifting. It doesn't require a ton of time, it feels great, and I do little cardio. Cardio causes me to be really fatigued so lifting is a great fit for me. I haven't lost much weight but I've lost a lot of inches."
4323,2020-10-01 02:56:19,j2wd3y,Thank you so much. I needed to read this. I'm starting from the absolute beginning for weight training and cardio training and I honestly want to give up every. Single. Day. But I don't because everyone says that it will become easier. I'm hoping what you and everyone else says is true because this is very mentally draining. I'm also looking into getting a personal trainer as well
4324,2020-10-01 03:42:43,j2wd3y,"It takes 4 weeks to actually achieve strength gains. You may ""feel stronger"" after two weeks, but that is because your neuromuscular wiring is improving. That is why you have to keep at it."
4325,2020-10-01 04:25:33,j2wd3y,"You're leaving out a lot of info here. 

Here's what's happening with your body. First of all, if you haven't been working out, jogging or anything like that, your body doesn't have the dedicated blood vessel infrastructure to properly supply your muscles with oxygen, nutrients, and clean up potential (lactic acid build up).

Your body is an efficient machine, and so if it isn't using things like your muscles, it won't build or use those blood vessels. It'll pull them back as it would be a waste of energy. 

So your getting tired because your body is demanding more than it can currently do ***at this moment***. But something magical happens. As you continue to work out over the weeks and months, your body starts to get into building mode. It sees that it needs more ""roads"" and so it'll start building more blood vessel locations throughout the muscles that you've been working on. 

Those muscles that are being worked are also being damaged, and so your body goes in and starts to repair them. And gosh, while your body is there, it might as well add more muscle to the location to make the tasks its been doing easier to manage. 

This can make you tired, because you're spending more energy than you're used to, and your body is doing more work than it is used to doing. You're feeling fatigue. 

There's another thing that will happen, depending on how hard you hit the weights. This usually happens if you haven't done any kind of weight lifting or jogging in a long time, but start up again. 

I don't know what the terminology is, but your body will get a next day ""shaky leg / arm"" feeling after your first work out (if it's been a long time). You'll feel a little wobbly in the legs and body (depending on what you targeted). Brace yourself, because the next day or two after the ""wobbly day"" will be very painful. Essentially, your body was put under a lot of stress, and this is your body recovering. You'll feel sore and stiff because you've likely caused a good bit of ""microdamage"" to your body's structure. This is rather normal and will not persist (or should not persist) if you keep working out, but give yourself a couple of days break before continuing. Listen to your body. 

Maybe the point is lost on me, but its not your brain feeling lazy, and it's not really you feeling lazy. It's your body letting you know that it feels tired and wants you to stop. Everyone has limits and you can usually push your limits, but more importantly, you need to make sure you listen to your body. 

Approaching exercise with the mindset of ""my brain is lazier than my muscles and doesn't want to change"" is not a good mindset to have for someone that is a novice with exercising / weight lifting. 

Do your homework. Learn how to do lifts properly. Form over reps, etc, etc."
4326,2020-10-01 05:08:56,j2wd3y,Im a 36 year old dude who is AD military. About 2 years ago I decided I wanted to make a change and began hitting the gym. The best decision I made and one I highly recommend to anyone starting out is start with weights far below what I could actually lift and work on form. It’s pays off down the road and let’s you really develop that individual muscle control. I truly did not care that I was 6 foot dude rep’n weights that most of the girls could easily throw around. I did it right and now 2 years later I’m one of the biggest dudes in the gym and I owe it all to solid fundamentals.
4327,2020-10-01 07:08:04,j2wd3y,"Another weird thing is that the stronger you get, weight doesn't real feel a lot lighter, you're just able to lift it.

It's weird. The resistance is definitely still there despite being a lot stronger."
4328,2020-10-01 02:36:50,j2wd3y,"This always happens when I try some new exercise... But what has been bothering me is that I have been back to lifting weights for a couple of weeks now (instead of just running like before) and I don't know if this is the reason but I've been so tired lately 😕 don't know if I'm too heavy on the weights or whatnot. It has improved a little since I've started eating more, but man... I'm just so tired

(edited for clarification)"
4329,2020-10-01 02:58:30,j2wd3y,"Another good way to think about it, you have to learn how to train before you can train. Technique, consistency, effort, and focus are skills you need to learn before your muscles will build strength. During this beginning process, you're going to feel tired and weak as you push yourself and learn. 

If you've never exercised before, then this is entirely new territory. It's a bit scary and you're going to make mistakes. But it's still part of the process and literally every successful athlete or gym goer you see has been through it. 

If you have exercised before, then this part will go a bit faster but it still happens. You have to remember and practice putting effort into the lift, or running at the right speed. You still have to spend time getting the technique correct. 

So don't feel bad when you spend a month in the gym without any gains. That month was important and required, and you will see the reward as you continue."
4330,2020-10-01 03:33:02,j2wd3y,"I’m a physical therapist, and you pretty much summed up 3 years of schooling in one Reddit post haha"
4331,2020-10-01 03:41:14,j2wd3y,"Strength Training Anatomy by Frederic Delavier really helped me a lot. I’ve also read his other books on core and functional mma workouts, among other books. Understanding proper movements, what happens when you use grip variations or alternative exercises, how to avoid injury, etc, really helped me start making serious progress. It’s been about 6 years now for me, and it’s gotten to the point where I can keep track of weeks worth of workouts in my head with all sorts of different exercise plans to keep my body surprised. Everything plays a role. You don’t have to commit to any one style of working out, you can mix in ballistic plyometrics, powerlifting, calisthenics, normal strength training movements, cardio, functional exercises, kettlebells, whatever you want to keep it interesting. Really take the time to understand what each exercise does and what it’s benefits are and what muscle groups are worked. Understand the difference between strength, speed strength, and power. Once you have enough knowledge it becomes second nature to plan ahead and stick to it.

Also, after that beginning phase you there’s a phrase affectionate referred to as ‘noob gains’, where you just start making crazy fast progress. You’ll suddenly be benching and squatting two+ plates in half the time it took you to get to one."
4332,2020-10-01 05:13:49,j2wd3y,"My problem is that in the past I overdid it. I wanted to get as ripped as I could in the shortest amount of time. Well, eventually I just hurt myself, but I didn't realize that I was doing so much damage, so I would keep at. Lift for 3 months, get hurt, stop for 3 months, lose all progress, rinse and repeat. In May of 2015, I hurt my bicep to the point that it just never felt like it was getting better, so I took a 4 year break, and last November started back up again with the idea that I was just gonna take it easy. I still lift and feel sore for a few days, but I was doing really well for about 5 months until corona hit. Took a couple months off, then realized the gym was open again on a limited basis. So I put my mask on and kept at it."

4335,2020-10-01 06:07:54,j2wd3y,Stupid brain. I work from home and try to lift small weights between calls but lost motivation.
4336,2020-10-01 06:22:59,j2wd3y,Stretching helps insanely with the fatigue. 10 mins before and/or after. You can tell a difference on your first go.
4337,2020-10-01 07:24:22,j2wd3y,"I've been a PT for 6 years and this is largely true. What he is referring to in terms of beginners is called skill acquisition. When you start practicing a new movement your nervous system needs to learn appropriate pathways and intra muscular coordination to produce force and move the weight. It's so important for beginners to learn the proper movement as it's easier to learn the movement and engrain it into the nervous system than it is to re learn a pattern you have been executing incorrectly for months or years. 

Strength is largely a skill and not a trait for example, you could be a beast at dead lifts but struggle to do a pull up because the pattern and intra muscular coordination has been developed specifically for the dead lift for those muscles to work together and produce force. It's super interesting!"

4339,2020-10-01 08:02:10,j2wd3y,"I shake my head at people that won't lift because they don't want to ""bulk up"".  Like it's some sort of insta-thing."
4340,2020-10-01 09:18:31,j2wd3y,"Your nervous system is also a huge part of it. You can feel great the days after a huge PR but still won't perform as well as you liked because the nervous system is a bit fried even if muscles feel fine.

And about starting as a new person at the gym? Nobody cares unless you're going something obviously dangerous or making weird sounds. If I see an overweight kid in there putting in work I'll give him a thumbs up after a good set. Usually breaks the ice if they later want to ask for help.

Also, the big dudes are usually just as passionate about seeing others grow as they are about themselves. I know that in my gym we usually are all in if a person asks for help or form critique."
4341,2020-10-01 10:51:04,j2wd3y,"For someone who just recently discovered some flaws in their form with certain exercises, this can happen to experienced gym goers too.
My core was never truly, properly activated during certain exercises and I paid the price with a lower back injury. After seeing the physio a couple of times, I now realise the err of my ways.
However, trying to teach my brain to engage the core feels as alien to me as perhaps what OP is talking about a person starting out.
Keep on keeping on everyone and get your form right before anything else!"
4342,2020-10-01 11:24:33,j2wd3y,"Three other things: 

1 this is also true when coming back to lifting after an injury.  Learned this the hard way.

2 a good way to acclimate is to do the movement with high frequency (think daily), but NOT heavy or to failure.  Training your brain to the movements will make noticeable strength gains (squat every day added 75lbs to my back squat and 100 to my front squat in just 3 months because my body learned to properly recruit muscle for the movement....also it was thanksgiving to christmas and i ate EVERYTHING).  Also, yes, there are people who will disagree, and it isn't for everyone (depending on time and availability, it might literally be impossible).  If not lifting, this principle also works amazingly with bodyweight exercise (do a pullup each time you walk through a certain doorway, or five pushups, etx.  Not enough to be taxing, just enough to do the movement)

3.  If you want to get strong, ask a powerlifter for help.  They are generally some of the most friendly and helpful people in a gym.  Hell, even in competition, they will give you tips and help you out.  (This is a generalization, as I realize some people are just naturally dicks, but in general, powerlifter types seem to want to see everyone get strong and improve).


Just my thoughts after the past 15 years or so."
4343,2020-10-01 12:34:21,j2wd3y,"I always thought this was due to your central nervous system and your body “learning” how to activate what muscles at certain times to maximize a lift.

I was told that when you’re new your body is almost fighting against you trying to lift weights but as you get better your body gets more efficient with muscle activation and you get stronger (on top of muscle growth). Idk if it’s true but it sounded reasonable"
4344,2020-10-01 13:42:29,j2wd3y,Damn I needed that post. Thank you for that.

4348,2020-10-01 14:42:25,j2wd3y,"Also, because your brain sorts it’s shit out, you’re going to have just gains in performance after a little bit, and then you’re going to be disappointed you can only add like 2.5 pounds to your bench for a while after you just added 60."
4349,2020-10-01 15:03:15,j2wd3y,"Neural adaptation is responsible for strength gains over first 4-8 weeks of training a new movement/muscle group.

4350,2020-10-01 19:19:48,j2wd3y,"There's a popular book on lifting with barbell called ""Starting Strength"". I found it a fascinating read, it goes into a great deal on how our muscles work and how we develop them. There's a section in it on muscular recruitment and neurological development."
4351,2020-10-01 02:36:04,j2wd3y,"Better TL;DR: If you haven't done weight training in a long time (or ever), it's best to start out ridiculously light, and resist the urge to ramp up the weight quickly in the first couple of months. By keeping the weight light the first few months, you reduce the chance you will injure yourself, and increase the chance you will stick with the program."

4363,2020-10-01 03:10:07,j2wd3y,So I've been working out at home doing bodyweight for nine months because covid. Does this mean when I finally feel real weights again my brain might rebel and force me to relearn how to handle weights again?
4364,2020-10-01 03:10:32,j2wd3y,"I'm curious is this is due to neuromotor tone. Basically your nerves need to tell your muscles to move or it doesn't happen. As you train, your muscles get stronger but your nervous system also adapts and makes it easier to control your muscles. Sometimes called muscle ""recruitment""."

4367,2020-10-01 03:18:54,j2wd3y,Wow I actually needed this today - I just started lifting (a couple weeks ago) and have been feeling this high-key
4368,2020-10-01 03:19:15,j2wd3y,"Fascinating. I got flack from someone on a workout sub for focusing on form rather than stacking on weight, and reading this helped confirm what I already suspected. Need to retrain the brain on core, muscle-isolating *movements* first, so I can get the most benefit as I add on weight. Been working out off an on for a few years, but really trying to focus on form for the first time."

You got this"

4374,2020-10-01 03:25:38,j2wd3y,"Not lifting related, but I was in a bad place in my final year of college. Then I ended up getting a good job, and on my first day I realised my office had a gym. I decided to start working out after a week, and on my first day to the gym, I could not do even one pull-up. I was ashamed of myself, and the  I saw people who were I  worse shape than me, trying their best. I kept trying that half-pull-up for 5 days and then all of a sudden, I could do 15-20 pull-ups without feeling like my arms were about to fall off!

TL;DR: felt like shit on my first day to the gym, didn't give up, realized I was capable of doing it all along."
4375,2020-10-01 03:26:17,j2wd3y,"“The only way forward is to do the motion, with a comfortable weight...” This is VERY important. “Comfortable” doesn’t mean the heaviest weight you can do. Start slow, get your body used to it and build up. I saw so make people put the max weight they could lift/bench their first time, and they either strained something or were so sore they couldn’t go back for a week."

4377,2020-10-01 03:33:36,j2wd3y,"This is true. It takes a lot of time and repetition to build the mind-muscle connection. I took a year off from working out because of some health problems and getting back into it was so fucking hard. I'm a medium sized guy and I was able to curl 35's with perfect form before I stopped working out. Then after not working out for a year, I had to start back at 5s and 10s just to get my mind to remember how to properly flex my bicep. On my first day back, I was fatigued after 1 set of 12 with just 5 lbs lol"
4378,2020-10-01 03:33:56,j2wd3y,Thank you and thank you and thank you. Now I understand more of my body (brain) and this post will keeps me going.

4380,2020-10-01 03:35:22,j2wd3y,Needed this push. I use to work out consistently for 3-5 years. Whenever I try to get back into it my body screams. My bones hurt all the time. I feel like my form is off. I don’t know what to do.
4381,2020-10-01 03:35:36,j2wd3y,"Therefore, start slow and consistent. When ppl lose a ton of weight because they push themselves hard I always notice a bounce back. They stop their heavy training and go back to eating and acting lazily. I’m like just gain consistency on a treadmill or an elliptical. Everyday. That way your head’s always in the game. Just my own two cents.."
4382,2020-10-01 03:35:58,j2wd3y,Steroids help too. A lot.
4383,2020-10-01 03:38:35,j2wd3y,"This takes some people decades to understand.

Yes you curled 40 pounds. But did you do it by contracting your bicep with your elbow in a fixed position, or did you use your whole arm, rotate your elbow a bit, and push your chest forward to lessen your range of motion needed for a successful rep."
4384,2020-10-01 03:39:31,j2wd3y,I needed to see this!
4385,2020-10-01 03:46:23,j2wd3y,"Great post. 

It's largely why any type of change is hard. Your brain is wired to protect you and that means keeping the status quo."
4386,2020-10-01 03:48:39,j2wd3y,"Also, another big hurdle, is the pain. It hurts to lift heavy weights, or even do bodyweight exercises in the beginning. Your muscles will burn, your joints will feel like they're being ripped apart. And then there's the terrible muscle pain the day after.

Just know, all that pain completely goes away. After a few months it won't hurt anymore. Especially the after workout aches."
4387,2020-10-01 04:01:11,j2wd3y,"Does this same concept apply to education?
For example if we are used to studying for 4 hours and want to increase that to 7 hours?"
4388,2020-10-01 04:03:29,j2wd3y,"The gym doesn’t having wheels so it’s not going anywhere. It’s not race but a marathon. If you feel hurt/sick/sore beyond your normal don’t ignore the pain. Your body builds and repairs itself in your sleep. So give your body extra time to recover, again the gym not going anywhere.


Work on your other muscle called your brain and on your diet. Doesn’t matter how hard you train in the gym, you can’t out train a bad diet. 



Every body is different what works for you wont work for everyone else when it comes to diet, routine & which exercises to perform. Experiment with your body.

4389,2020-10-01 04:05:26,j2wd3y,"Damn, this really snapped into perspective just how important form is! I always knew it was crucial, and that you shouldn’t start adding weight until you have it nailed down, but I thought that was only to prevent injury. It makes a whole lot of sense that you’d have to fight your natural urge to use other muscles to help when you’re trying to work a single muscle or muscle group specifically, and that form is what lets that happen! I started lifting with dumbbells at home recently, and I do try to feel each exercize in the specific muscles it’s trying to work, but it’s tough to get sometimes! Triceps and, oddly enough, chest are hard for me to fire individually"
4390,2020-10-01 04:06:25,j2wd3y,This really helps me. Thank you.
4391,2020-10-01 04:08:54,j2wd3y,"The best part is that once you get used to it and understand the mind-muscle connection, even if you put the weights down for a long period of time, your body remembers what it’s like to tear down and build back up in a way you never expect."
4392,2020-10-01 04:10:31,j2wd3y,Now this is sth everyone should know. You’ve earned my Hugz award good man
4393,2020-10-01 04:11:38,j2wd3y,"TIL, I have a super strong brain"
4394,2020-10-01 04:11:53,j2wd3y,Commonly referred to the mind-muscle connection. It’s as much teaching your brain what it means to contract a specific muscle as it is growing that muscle.
4395,2020-10-01 04:12:14,j2wd3y,I began taking barre classes (wayyyy harder than I thought) and the teacher would always say “your brain will give up before your body will” and that kept me going. I remind myself of that a lot while exercising. Only regretted it once doing some weird ballet glute move and I cramped up big time. Body won that round.
4396,2020-10-01 04:13:09,j2wd3y,"Yep. Started working out again in July after years of not doing it and did cardio which wasn't too bad but it wasn't until I started lifting weights a few weeks ago that I started to get fatigued. Once I pushed myself to do it and get motivated those reps started getting easier in the same workout.

The brain is basically like a muscle itself. If you fail to exercise it whether it be working out or doing problem-solving skills you will start to lack in that category more."
4397,2020-10-01 04:13:22,j2wd3y,"Great tip! I guess that's what happened to me when I started doing biceps and struggling to lift next to no weight. Took a while, but then, in one week, I progressed to 7x what I was able to before."
4398,2020-10-01 04:13:36,j2wd3y,"I can attest to this,
I’ve been living since March on an off-grid permaculture farm, doing a huge amount of shovelling, digging, wheelbarrowing & generally moving heavy stuff from one place to another as we build with cob and do earthworks that people usually hire machinery to do.
This has been a huge life change, I’ve never been fit or strong in my life, but now as we go into October, I’m definitely noticing that I can lift/push/shovel way more & for much longer than when I first started!
I’ve had a great teacher, who’s very patient & has been making sure I move correctly so I don’t ruin my back.
I used to have terrible back pain before this, but putting in a long hard day of work just makes me tired, but I don’t feel injured - turned out that sitting all day hurts my back much more!
It’s really cool & motivating to finally be noticeably stronger & more capable, though it does take time."
4399,2020-10-01 04:13:49,j2wd3y,"That is a good way of thinking about it, I think I’ll workout tonight in my mind."
4400,2020-10-01 04:18:08,j2wd3y,"but the moment you push through it and enter a groove, it's just so amazing. you look and feel better and it's incredible"
4401,2020-10-01 04:24:20,j2wd3y,"also keep in mind your tendons get stronger at a far far slower rate than muscles.

in the first few years it's pretty easy to get so strong that you're going to hurt your own body, which is why many people get injuries despite doing everything ""right""."
4402,2020-10-01 04:34:00,j2wd3y,I always knew I am not lazy it's my Brain.
4403,2020-10-01 04:35:42,j2wd3y,"There was a study done, I believe, that showed image training (mentally performing exercise,  literally imagining the process as a virtual session)  would lead to about 30% performance enhancement of actual muscle training. 

I'm pretty sure it's for the same reason."
4404,2020-10-01 04:36:18,j2wd3y,"I really wanted to read that post, however my brain is way too lazy..."
4405,2020-10-01 04:38:43,j2wd3y,"This is actually true. Your early strength gains arnt muscle hypertrophy, but rather a better recruitment of the neuromuscular junctions in your muscles and the fibers they innervate. Meaning you’re activating more of your overall muscle (think mind muscle connection) so your first gains are mostly a neuromuscular progress, and using the muscle you do have more effectively and efficiently.

Great write up!"
4406,2020-10-01 04:39:19,j2wd3y,Preworkout for days
4407,2020-10-01 04:43:35,j2wd3y,This is especially true if you're following a routine that's increasing weight week by week. I did the original stronglifts 5x5 and kept increasing my weight by 5lbs for all major lifts. It wasn't till I bought a mirror to watch my form that my back was bending on my deadlift
4408,2020-10-01 04:43:41,j2wd3y,"So this question is pretty awful but I want some outside input:

Could this effect have any relation to what I've heard lovingly called ""retard strength""? Asking for a strong friend."
4409,2020-10-01 04:45:41,j2wd3y,"Thanks for taking the time to write this up. At least for myself, your info, I think it will help with mentally framing the muscle improvement / weight loss process (weights and cardio), as more of a gradual marathon than an impatient sprint."
4410,2020-10-01 04:46:52,j2wd3y,I would love to start lifting I’m just overall lazy and have zero motivation which isn’t good
4411,2020-10-01 04:47:14,j2wd3y,> You can't move muscles you don't have.
4412,2020-10-01 04:50:59,j2wd3y,Wrong. You're going to feel weaker because your muscles are tired!
4413,2020-10-01 04:54:50,j2wd3y,I stopped using my exercise bike/took a break because my legs felt weaker and I thought I was overworking myself. Thanks for this advice!
4414,2020-10-01 04:58:26,j2wd3y,">life's over in an instant.

If you're lucky"
4415,2020-10-01 04:59:07,j2wd3y,"This makes sense! So I recently started lifting regularly, about the same time as a friend with a similar slim build. 

I’ve been gaining muscle quicker, and I think it’s because I ran competitively for 9 years (high school and college) and my friend did not. I’ve been focused on building my lower half/lean muscle for soo long that it didn’t take long for my body to switch gears to upperbody strength building. Idk maybe im making this up lmao just an observation"

4417,2020-10-01 05:04:18,j2wd3y,This happens even when you are fit and take time off too. I got lazy with my diet and exercise for a while during COVID and when I got back into it I was struggling to do sets of 20 pushups which is absurd for me. Only two weeks later I'm knocking out sets of 40-50. The strength was there but something was holding me back subconsciously.
4418,2020-10-01 05:08:19,j2wd3y,This just motivated the hell out of me! Thank you!
4419,2020-10-01 05:17:06,j2wd3y,"Everything. Guitar. Praying. Meditating. Sobriety. Socializing. Time management. 
It all sucks at first."
4420,2020-10-01 05:17:22,j2wd3y,So this is also maybe the reason why it is easier to build up once you've stopped lifting. Since your brain knows it has done this before.
4421,2020-10-01 05:36:50,j2wd3y,"Which is good in the beginning. I overdid it on my first time ever going to the gym and couldn't move my arms for 3 days. My wife had to lift me out of the hot tub, put clothes on me etc. It sucked."

4427,2020-10-01 06:03:31,j2wd3y,"I've been working out for \~4 years. Had my best results in the 1st year I think due to the shock I put my body on, never doing such thing before. In the following years I did not have that much of a progress, but that didn't keep me from going to the gym still. It's not just about muscles for some people, but having a healthy routine."
4428,2020-10-01 06:06:39,j2wd3y,"Mind-muscle connection is crucial. You’re right, it just takes time."
4429,2020-10-01 06:08:31,j2wd3y,"From someone who can call them self a bodybuilder (I look the part) take it for what it is, I’ve found that working out while high on THC helps tremendously with building that mind muscle connection. I’d also recommend posing, it might feel strange to do and it’s honestly very difficult to do but it will do wonders for you in the long run. (Isometric exercise, stronger contractions and mind muscle connection)"
4430,2020-10-01 06:13:39,j2wd3y,I think I’ll go for a run tomorrow. This is the info I needed. Thanks!

I tried to build up arm strength a few years back but after months I noticed no progress so my motivation died down. I recently started studies for a job that requires lots of strength, so I renewed my gym membership, but I've been putting off starting my workouts because I've been scared that I'll work a lot and again get no results. 

So thank you so so much man, you brought back my motivation in a flash, I'm going back to the gym on my next day off and I'm gonna become a fucking great EMT"

(I used to be way stronger than that years ago, perhaps it doesn’t counts when it’s not out first time training?)"

4440,2020-10-01 06:54:01,j2wd3y,"So many people think being strong is about getting big when the fact of the matter is that while bigger muscles can generate more force a HUGE amount of strength you develop is just fine tuning your nervous system. Otherwise how else could people get stronger while not gaining weight?

Most powerlifters stay in the same weight class and most aren’t significantly changing their body composition. For elite lifters almost all strength gains are CNS.

Also the terry crews thing was a funny mention. Most people think your pecs need to be big to pop them. Nope. Even people with a tiny chest can pop their pecs. They just don’t have the mind-muscle connection. If I told you to flex your chest without moving any limbs could you do it? If yes then you have that connection."

So I kept using my biceps and my back wasnt being targeted. Plus I was more of a long distance swimmer so I didnt have to use a lot of bicep and tricep. They were really weak, they still are compared to my body weight and size. I just had to kind of squeeze my back and my trainer has to touch my back for me to feel which muscles i should have been using. The pinpoint touching helped a lot."
4446,2020-10-01 07:27:56,j2wd3y,"I read somewhere that repetition can thicken/improve the myelin sheath surrounding nerves, thus improving neural conductivity. 


If losing nerves can cause a loss of strength, like through an injury, then maybe this is the inverse of that.


The latter part is just my hypothesis though."
4447,2020-10-01 07:30:50,j2wd3y,"This also kind of applies if you've been working out for a while.

The explanation why is similar, your brain is learning to fire the muscles at the same time. When it does it leads to you being able to lift more, but now you can, you'll only gain strength from improving the muscle itself which is slower. 



And the solution is the same. Keep at it and you'll get past the tough spell. I neglected my legs and back when i started working out and now I've worked them for a month I've made big improvements but i know it's about to stagnate. But that's fine, consistency is key and will give you results even if you're using the worst routine imaginable."
4455,2020-10-01 08:37:16,j2wd3y,"This is an extremely eccentric (pun intended) and long winded (pun intended) way to describe neuromuscular adaptation.

In short, it's about motor control.  Your brain / CNS gets better at intra, inter, and extra muscular coordination.  Your 4 different muscles in your quads get better at talking to each other.  Your nerves within a singular muscle get better at talking to each other.  And your nerves within multiple muscle groups involved in a particular exercise (pull-up: Biceps and back) get better at talking to each other. 

This change happens quickly over the course of 3-6 weeks and is the primary driver behind the majority of strength gains made over the first 6 months of ones weight lifting journey."
4456,2020-10-01 08:41:58,j2wd3y,Is it the same for resistance excersizes like swimming? been trying to lose weight and recently i can barely reach a mile (40 x 25m lengths) whilst a fortnight ago i could easily do 70-80 lengths

I've been going for three weeks often and I am surprised that I've noticed a lot of change in appearance of my body. When it comes to the amount I can life I'm not to far off what I was lifting when I stopped going to the gym. 
This is where the problem comes in when I had previously gone to gym I could never really increase past these mediocre levels of weight lifting after reaching them after my first 6 months of gyming. 
Does this mean im unlikely to continue this increase in form im having?"

4461,2020-10-01 09:02:10,j2wd3y,"I always thought this was more connected to your “don’t do this, you’ll die” reflex than your brain not knowing how to make the contract. You know how there’s that reflex that’s supposed to stop you from doing shit that hurts (not that it can’t be overcome), or how you can perceive a certain amount of pain before it gets too much, but if you keep at it your pain tolerance increases? I thought it was more connected to that rather than my brain not knowing how to send strong signals to specific muscles.

Years ago when I first started working out, I went through about a month where I could increase weight in every lift I did by about 5 kilos every set, and always be increasing. For example I started benching the 20kg bar and struggled like spongebob in that one episode, but the next set I could go up to 25, then 30. Then the next week I could start at like 30 and struggle just as much as I was when I was only doing 20. It capped out at about 50-ish when I first started maxing out and I reached my muscular maximum instead of my mental maximum. My brain seemed to go through a phase of “this is the heaviest thing I’ve ever lifted, don’t go higher or we’ll die” and then when I was forced to increase by little bits at a time I could do it now problem, but I’d have the same reaction. My brain’s perceived strength and my muscle’s actual strength seemed to eventually meet over time.

Same thing seems to happen a little bit after a period where I’ve stopped working out. I’ll start back and go through about a month where I can rapidly build gains at maybe 10kg a week-ish, then I’ll plateau out as I start to approach my old maximum and that’s when I know how much I actually atrophied.

I’ve never done any research into it, so feel free to educate me further or send links, it’s just stuff I’ve noticed without knowing the physiological responses causing it.

If you’re looking for motivation, when I first started I really struggled to bench and squat 20kg, and deadlift like 50kg. Before the gyms shut because of the plague, the maximum I could bench was like 95kg, my squat was at like 110kg, and I could deadlift 150kg. Throughout the whole time I consistently weight 83kg. No fucking clue why specifically 83, but I started at 83 and I weighed 83 when I was lifting that."

4463,2020-10-01 09:18:58,j2wd3y,Isn't it more likely to be weak tendons and ligaments that take significantly longer to grow and strengthen than muscle?
4464,2020-10-01 09:27:56,j2wd3y,"Yea this explains my dilemma. Literally can't bench press the bar. Its like 20kg. My arms and chest have little development, it wasnt a surprise really.

However my expectations were low, but I somehow felt embarrassed anyway. I've lifted music equipment that was heavier. 

I know I'm skinny and underdeveloped in any muscular capacity but it was a real eye opener when I couldnt lift the bar from my chest.

I can't do a single press up or pull up either.

I'm still going though, there are plenty of machines for the time being.

And to make matters a little more embarrassing, I'm in a gym with absolute monsters. 

But heres the thing. I'm throwing myself in at the deep end to change my mindset that everyone in the gym will look at how skinny I am and judge me. 
Which, is total bollocks by the way. Couldnt meet nicer people. Everyone in there is concentrating on themselves and you'll barely make eye contact to be honest.

I had just recovered from radiation therapy for cancer, the second time in my life. I spent hours just going through the motions, with little to no weight. I was curling about 7 pounds in the beginning, with other exercises it was as low as 3 pounds. Most people don't realize that a gallon of milk weighs about 8 pounds, and for someone who doesn't lift weight regularly, that little of weight gets really heavy really quickly. I have been able to change my body shape, and get much stronger over the last two months. I have also gone all in, I spend anywhere from an hour, to an hour and a half, just lifting weights. Nothing really heavy, my bar only has 46 pounds on it from yesterday's workout. It doesn't take a lot of weight to get results, it takes time. The more time you can dedicate, the better the returns. Always keep in mind that you want the weight to be difficult to lift multiple times, while maintaining complete control over it. You don't want to be swinging around any part of your body to move the weight."

4519,2020-10-01 19:25:09,j2wd3y,As someone who has been delivering furniture for the last 3 years you’re spot on. Everyone that starts is usually “weak” af but after a few months they get significantly better and they don’t work out or do anything really other than train the brain to use your muscles. The brain muscle connection is real and needs to be used frequently or its gone (but not permanently). Your brain literally doesn’t know where to send the signal. But it will eventually. It’s like a baby learning to walk. It’s the most complex thing to them but with time and dedication it’s second nature

The vast majority of people would rather give you a thumbs up and encourage you than make fun of you. The only person you’re exercising for is you.

4530,2020-10-01 08:36:16,j2wd3y,"This post is bullshit. You can nearly always throw whatever ""personal trainers"" say about your health into trash because it's more than likely they never studied any subject related to health. And similarly, you can throw this post into trash, because the OP ""heard it from a trainer"" and made the rest up, so you got 2 very certain point of failures.

Now, what really happens is: you don't have the muscles. Muscles undergo hypertrophy as you exercise, and although the exact pathophysiology is unknown, it is more than certain it has something to do with intrinsic factors, such as developing blood vessels (angiogenesis). Have you ever exercised and lost strength, or your muscles begun to shake randomly while you were using them? The most probable and explained cause is that muscle contraction compresses your blood vessels, effectively stopping the blood flow to a muscles => muscles lose nutrients => relax => blood vessels expand again => give nutrients => muscles can contract once again. This cycle happens tens of times per second. Increase in vasculature to prevent this happens over the course of days to weeks, which is likely what limits the muscle strength. Periods of ischemia (lack of nutrients availablity) is what stimulates angiogenesis, and there are many pathways for it. That's why periodic stimulation of muscle (ie. exercise) will help you get better muscle blood flow.

As far as I can tell, whatever the personal trainer's ""brain as a limiting factor"" hypothesis, without proper physiological explanation, is just made-up bullshit to keep you motivated. If you are able to present the physiological mechanism for it though, then I'll be more than happy to listen.

I think that's what they called ""the wall"" and its where you run out of the readily available food-energy and your body has to start burning stored calories in your fat. The process apparently takes time to get going if it isn't used to it so you hit a period of basically running on Empty. After doing it a bunch, the changeover happens a lot more smoothly and you don't get the wall.   


That's what we were always told, at least. Dunno if its the same type of brain change, or like, a chemical one with whatever process handles fat burning. Would be fun to read more into.

I'm 38 and have been out for over 10 years.  I'm in, let's just say, less than stellar shape.  However, because I've long since tackled the mental part, I can outdo people who are probably more fit than myself.

This YSK doesn't just apply to exercise but to every single thing in our lives. So many people let their bodies decide on what to do (what to eat, whether to go for a walk or not, whether to get a task done now or tomorrow, whether to drink water or get a latte, ...)."

my friend started lifting with us a *month and a half* ago. he was and still is a die hard long distance runner and always thought weightlifting was about ego and vanity. that he isn't a complete novice to exercise might exclude him from OP's point aimed at total beginners in fitness, but from my own experiences and observations i think a lot of people will see notable progress in a month.

my boy is now hooked and making crazy progress. he has gone from not even been able to lift an empty bar to multiple sets of: bench pressing 5x30kg*, deadlifting 5x50kg, squatting 5x40 kg, pressing 5x25kg. has gone from 0 pull ups to 3. still not massive weights and form can be a little shaky in later sets but he is adding more weight to all lifts every other session and looking more confident during lifts every time. can't wait to see what he will be like by the time of his wedding next summer. he will tell you himself he was wildly mistaken with his assumptions about both lifting itself and the kind of stereotypes of people who lift.

You don't need any weights, you can do everything with bodyweight but you'll need to workout in a balanced manner, if you don't do pulls for example your shoulders will hunch forwards and the bad posture will do you no good in the long run.


Push ups are good, but focus on form rather than reps. Rows are good, tie and knot in a bedsheet, throw it over a door and close the door then lower yourself down the bedsheet and do reverse push ups, pulling yourself towards the door. Sit ups are good, but there are better core exercises like planks that won't stress your back in the long run.

4594,2020-10-01 03:06:21,j2wd3y,"IMO body weight training is a lot harder and takes more discipline than weight training. 

This is because all weight training regiments are about progressively adding more and more weight every session, and you slowly add 5-10 lbs every week. This process allows you to  efficiently target your peak and challenge it. 

Weight training also targets specific repetition ranges. For example, a common program may take 10 repetitions, 1 minute break between, for 3 sets. This rep range is believed to maximize muscle growth when you train to failure. 

It's way harder to target a specific rep range using body weight exercises. 

Finally it's really hard to do back exercises using body weight only. You will absolutely need to balance chest with back.

I would not recommend whatever OP has suggested... The typical strategy is to start at a weight lower than you max and work your way up to your limit, and then past your limit. Weight lifting is like slowly chiseling a rock. You're only adding 5 lbs a week, but by the end of the month that's 20 lbs gain, if you can keep that up! For example I started with a 90 lb bench press to 135 lb. 95 lb squat to a 200 lb squat, by slowing adding weight every session. When you fail a set, repeat the weight the next session. When you succeed, add another tiny weight."
4595,2020-10-01 02:46:56,j2wd3y,"I would say yes to that.  I’m not an expert but I’m not a novice either.  When your lifting, your nervous system as well as your skeletal system are being forced to adapt to new added stress.  So it really doesn’t matter if it’s iron weights or body weight.  The body may adapt differently from one to the other (specific movement exercises intended to target muscles applied to a specific movement)

Edited to add I am a muscle anatomy instructor and have lifted regularly for several years"
4596,2020-10-01 02:13:52,j2wd3y,"You know, I'm not positive. 

I didn't do body-weight workouts during my period of just getting started because it was more efficient to isolate muscle groups using cables and machines. 


It very likely is, though. The motion and resistance are both there so it makes sense. Both of those exercises involve a great deal more of the body than an isolation movement as well, so I'm not sure what that effect would be."

4602,2020-10-01 08:30:04,j2wd3y,I was underweight for a long time... ended up doing GOMAD for a couple of months and got my weight up fast. Not the healthiest thing in the world but it worked for me. I’m 5’ 9” and weighed about 110lbs; I’m 160lbs now. I stopped GOMAD at around 130lbs but tracked my calories and macros religiously until I hit 150lbs and gained the rest slowly. I weight-lifted throughout the entire journey. Best decision I’ve ever made.
4603,2020-10-01 05:48:26,j2wd3y,"Mind muscle connection babyy, it's a great thing. it definitely improves your form and stability, and ensures you're using the proper muscles for the lift"
4604,2020-10-01 05:43:40,j2wd3y,"I found this to be useful too. I like to think of it as chi (I know nothing about it, just that it is some form of inner energy) which you can focus on different muscles. I'm trying to lose weight so I run 1.6km daily and everytime, before I run, I'll close my eyes and focus all my energy to my legs and my heart. Makes exercising a breeze !"
4605,2020-10-01 03:18:08,j2wd3y,How do you mean?
4606,2020-10-01 05:45:12,j2wd3y,"I like to think of it this way: if you're at a gym and thinking about yourself or being self conscious, so is everyone else. People are inherently self centered i feel."
4607,2020-10-01 06:42:48,j2wd3y,Also newbie gains :) They are fun!
4608,2020-10-01 12:29:55,j2wd3y,I mean it's not time consuming if you just go to the gym once or twice a week for an hour. For people with a goal or a plan that they Actually follow its pretty time consuming I would say. At least for most people getting up five or six times a week two and a half hours earlier than usual (or getting home later) absolutely is. And that's without adding cardio
4609,2020-10-01 03:07:16,j2wd3y,"It gets easier, then you make it heavier and it sucks again, but by then you don't mind it as much. 

I genuinely can't recommend a good trainer enough. I would absolutely have been lost without mine. I also started from absolute 0 gym experience but can now pretty easily handle 400lbs and climbing. 

Another good bit of advice that I got a long time ago is: It takes 1 month for you to notice any difference, 3 months for friends and coworkers, and 6 months for everyone else. In regard to outward physical change. 

So you gotta stick it out at least those 6 months to see who is noticing. Then its all worth it."

I always stretch before, and for some workouts I do forced stretching with weights between sets(and it hurts SO much). Some guys rarely stretch. Some only stretch after. One guy absolutely refuses to stretch at all for body building.

4625,2020-10-01 02:51:15,j2wd3y,"Keeping in mind that resistance is still important to the process. The weight should feel comfortable, but present. If you can bang out 30 reps no problem, too light, if you can't do 15 on the first set, too heavy. (This assumes you've already warmed up with a super light set).

Thats sorta the lazy-man's metric that worked for me."
4626,2020-10-01 06:25:35,j2wd3y,"Helps teach form too. If you’re swinging your arms or putting your shoulder into a bicep curl, it’s way too heavy.

4627,2020-10-01 00:00:07,j2wd3y,"You have to build new neural pathways when you learn any new skill. Not just in lifting, but in this case I'm talking about it so people can have a better understanding of their weaknesses. 

To your other point, my trainer has a Bachelors Degree and is fully certified, so these aren't anecdotes from a random guy, they are the advice of a professional in their field of expertise.

""Adaptive alterations can be induced in the neuromuscular system in response to specific types of training. Thus, increases in maximal contraction force and power as well as maximal rate of force development (RFD) will occur not only because of alterations in muscle morphology and architecture (2), but also as a result of changes in the nervous system (1,4,12).""

There's a ton of journals that look into this, I've put 3 or 4 in the comments and post. Its certainly not new, just something I was talking to a friend about that spurred me to make the post. 


Basically, you see that after some time resistance training, not only does the brain trigger a stronger contract signal, but it also increases the frequency of the signals a measurable amount. So even though you haven't gained muscle mass, you are able to move more weight because you are more effectively able to contract the muscle. 

Someone posted a great comment detailing all the different physical components of this but its a bit buried and I'm on my phone."
4647,2020-10-01 12:32:33,j2wd3y,"In my experience, those big dudes will he stoked to help you, and give you really good advice if you ask. 


If you can't press an empty bar, maybe start on dumbbell presses with maybe 10 pounds in each hand. Your shoulder stabilizers are very weak and easily injured so start very light. If AT ALL your hand starts to drift backwards drop the weight, you won't save it once it starts moving and it can absolutely tear something. 
You can also do floor presses with them, where you lie directly on the floor so you have less motion to cover per rep."

4649,2020-10-01 12:37:22,j2wd3y,"If you're doing a motion you don't typically do, its going to be weaker. General strength doesn't mean you will do every workout at the same level, so you might need to change up your routine to balance out. Unbalanced strengths can be dangerous when moving to a new workout and trying to go heavy because you can damage a stabilizer that isn't up to par with the main muscle group"

1. Your brain needs to be trained to actually use the muscles you have efficiently, because it probably doesn't if you've never taught it to
2. Using machines for the first few months is far superior to using free weights, because it rarely allows you to cheat the form
3. The only point you seem to have gotten.

4661,2020-10-01 06:27:42,j2wd3y,"Just want to add one caveat - cheat reps aren't all bad. Sometimes they help you to hit that progressive overload at the end of a set. If I'm doing something like curls or lateral raises and I can't do another strict rep, but feel like there's still gas left in the tank, I'll fire off a cheat rep or two to make sure I'm getting right up to that pre-failure point I'm wanting to hit. Cheating can help you get just a little more out of your workout, but I'll add that this is probably a little more advanced technique for once your strength gains start to plateau a bit."

4672,2020-10-01 02:33:29,j2wd3y,"I don't know if this is the same thing you mean, but when I''ve been slacking for a few ~~days~~ months and decide to start running again, the wall always hits me about two blocks in. It feels like the point where my body or brain or something is like, ""Wait, we're still going? This isn't just a short jog to the car or something? Aw hell no."" And then after another half mile (or longer, some days) it finally stops bitching and resigns itself to the fact that yes, we are actually doing this."
4673,2020-10-01 01:22:59,j2wd3y,"Yes I've heard of that! In my experience, honestly I think it was more about anxiety and breathing. I had a lot of anxiety about running, I have anxiety-induced asthma, my brain would say I can't do this, or I'd think people were looking at me or judging how hard I was breathing and it'd trip me up. I've never had a panic attack but my body felt like it just couldn't handle it, like I was headed there. It was largely mental, though. I learned to relax my shoulders and exhale to try to calm myself down. My brain just had to get used to my body doing this and realize I *could* breathe, if I relaxed a little.

So maybe it's a little different than what you were describing with lifting, but it definitely reminded me of my experience."
4674,2020-10-01 06:02:17,j2wd3y,"This is correct. In simplest terms *The Wall* is when you've depleted your glycogen stores within your muscles and liver. Due to this your body has to find an alternative source of energy. It will then begin to pull from your fat stores, breaking them back down into glucose.

 ATP, ADP, etc. It's all cellular respiration.

IIRC the *high* associated with pushing through the wall is basically your brain picking back up its normal function.

Your body is constantly burning a carb/fat mixture all day, everyday. The ratio changes though based upon intensity and your body's instantaneous needs. You'll burn more fat with slow, steady state running vs a few wind sprints.

When you blow through your energy reserves— glycogen— your brain starts to try and shut things down. It's a survival mechanism. It wants you to stop and conserve energy. This leads to the mental block you'll experience at times, the negative thoughts that come with the onset of *the wall*. 

As you push through the wall and your body finally says ""FINE I'll find the energy elsewhere."" It begins to convert fat into useable energy, and the brain's function revs back up to normal. This change is what leads to the ""high"".

*The Wall* can hit anyone at different times, and be very inconsistent as well. Some people it may never hit."
4675,2020-10-01 05:10:57,j2wd3y,"This idea doesn't feel copacetic with my personal running experience. Whenever I fatigue in running, it is pretty much never because of my muscles tiring or feeling like my energy source is changing. It's always because I feel like I can no longer breathe adequately. Like, my muscles feel like they could keep going but my runs pretty much always end with me gasping for air."
4676,2020-10-01 04:33:32,j2wd3y,I only broke through that wall once and it was at like 5 miles. I suddenly felt like I could run a marathon but had to stop due to fears of dehydration =(. It was so weird after persisting on pure willpower.

4678,2020-10-01 03:40:11,j2wd3y,I feel like that is never the case for. It's my body huffing and puffing and grasping for air that's telling me to give up.

I'm trying to get my friend into it, and he's just not used to moving the weight like the post says. I should probably get him on machines a bit more, but I keep telling him that he just needs to be consistent and beginner gains will come, I promise"

If you absolutely want to, make sure you get your form down perfect.

Alternatively you can do a ruck. It's less impact than running but you get similar benefits. Just fill a backpack with stuff until it weighs an appropriate amount. You'll need to judge that for yourself, but it's worth it."
4692,2020-10-01 10:30:08,j2wd3y,"Personally, I take off the mask as soon as possible. And while it may seem fairly trivial, I highly recommend finding a good pace you can keep all the way through without sprinting yourself out. When you sprint yourself out and have to start walking, your heart rate falls, which makes it just that much harder to get back into a running pace. All I can really say other than that is don't get discouraged, drink water, and keep practicing."

Never seen it happen and guys pull like 100 lbs at my gym.  Have to start somewhere.  I will raise my eyebrows if someone is being excessive.  Like some dude was shouting on every rep of every exercise I could hear him through my earbuds across the gym.  If he was pushing weight I'd feel some more leeway but even then it would have been too much.  Oh, and I'll give squinty eyes at people that hog equipment.  Standing db lat raises followed by standing curls, followed by standing db presses does not require you to use one of the only benches for 30 minutes. Oh and people that don't wipe down equipment.

How do you expect someone who has never lifted before to be able to do pull ups?"

4715,2020-10-01 14:17:54,j2wd3y,"If you have a pullup bar and TRX bands, once you have a base of strength, that will be more than sufficient for most people to build a very nice back.

Pullups and chin-ups of varying grip width and TRX rows make for a very good workout.

If you’re newer, you can use bands to make pullups/chin-ups easier to get your target rep range, and if you’re stronger, you can add weight on a belt. For TRX, if you’re newer, you can stand more upright to make the motion easier, and if you’re stronger, you can make the movement more parallel to the ground, making it much harder."
4716,2020-10-01 06:22:40,j2wd3y,"I made roughly the same progress as you when I started lifting well over a year ago, and then just plateaued. It took me a long time to realize I wasn’t getting anywhere on some of my lifts and I was putting “do this weight again!” in my notes after most of my sessions *for months*. I never really figured it out but I’ve been with a 1 on 1 trainer during covid and seen so much growth on less weight. Maybe my form sucked? Maybe I never pushed hard enough? Maybe I didn’t have enough variety or lifts targeting smaller muscles. It’s also probably related to not doing hardly any abs/core work before...."
4717,2020-10-01 09:21:52,j2wd3y,Machines and cables? Bodyweight exercises and compound lifts are vastly superior.
4718,2020-10-01 03:13:10,j2wd3y,Definitely observed this (anecdotally) in my own lifting. My biggest gains came after focusing on good form more than higher weight
4719,2020-10-01 03:15:32,j2wd3y,"Yes, exactly! The first six weeks you are litterally training your brain and muscles to coordinate activity! This is actually the steepest learning curve. There are studies to suggest thst after you learn to actually recruit muscles the biggest development actually happens. For added psychological bonus, never be worried about looking small or not doing enough weight. Work out, it's fantastic for you, and work on developing correct biomechanics. If you start off correctly you will decrease chance of injury and help your overall health."
4720,2020-12-26 23:26:10,j2wd3y,It is mostly neurological when that happens. Your body is always tuning your muscles for adequate strength and balance so it's kind of like sizing up the weight for your muscles to get ready. At first it may seem impossible but your muscles have been prepared to take on similar weight that you have been strength training for.

When doing a pull up in this case, i focua on my back muscles and not my arm muscles. In this way i am also forcing myself proper form."
4725,2020-10-02 22:12:51,j2wd3y,"I've been out of lifting for a few years but I remember, going into it, that I expected weight to feel lighter as I got stronger. That doesn't seem to be the case. The weight still feels just as heavy you're just able to lift it"

4728,2020-10-01 14:42:05,j2wd3y,I asked this because I didn't find it difficult to start working out. There have been times where I didnt wanna work out for a couple of days but to stop working out entirely? I would be ashamed of myself if it ever came that. So yea I believe it is easier for me.

4732,2020-10-01 15:40:52,j2wd3y,"Yeah, I was mainly thinking about compound lifts since that’s what I primarily train. They require more in sync muscle activation across a broad group of muscles so when someone pitched it to me like above it made sense in my mind.

You’re post is solid, and I hope no one gets discouraged from being healthier. I never played sports when I was in high school and only got active in the gym late in college. Wish I did it sooner. I’m far from the biggest guy but I’m strong and I see people only half a decade older than me look like they’re not in a good place. I want to stress that it’s important to take care of yourself just like you would a house or a car. Baby steps.

Good post OP"
4733,2020-10-01 15:23:45,j2wd3y,"Yes and no. 
If it’s an uncomplicated movement (lets say bicep curl) and there is no neurological issues, motor learning should be about accomplished in 1-4 weeks. 

The actual growth of muscle(hypertrophy) and strength gains usually take a bit longer than 1-4 weeks and therefore are the ‘stubborn’ part of the equation. 

Now say you are trying to learn the Snatch or Clean and Jerk. Much more technical movement, higher degree of skill needed, longer it will take for neural adaption/motor learning.

When I started training for running for my first triathlon, I noticed when I would listen to music that had expectable crescendos I would have a really hard time sticking with my training sessions. I shifted to longer form, electronic music playlists (specifically dub techno which is a smoldering form of the genre that slowly and consistently increases tempo) and found that I had much more success with that and I think it speaks to your point about helping lower my anxiety. When I had music that would go up and down and up and down I noticed my thinking patterns would follow and then your body reacts."
4760,2020-10-01 13:00:59,j2wd3y,"This! I'd like to add some cool facts:

In an average man, the body stores 600 kcal in glycogen sores, in the cells (mainly liver and muscle), and 100 000 kcal in fat stores (adipose tissue). It is estimated that storing energy as fat is 6 times more efficient than as glycogen. Obviously fat is a much better source of energy, but it has a problem: breaking down, transporting and oxidising fats for energy is a very slow process compared to glycogen.  So for explosive exercise, first you use your glycogen stores, and by the time they are depleted you will have had time to start mobilising the fat. (I'm guessing this is also why warming up before exercise is a good idea?)"

Once you have a bit of endurance built, you start going further and further. I rode 100 miles in one go for the first time a couple weeks ago. Before that my best was 64 miles. You better believe at 70 miles my brain was screaming GET OFF THIS FUCKING BIKE!

But you can't. By the end of it I felt like my brain was dead and I was just pumping my legs on instinct. I knew I would be able to handle it physically, so the only obstacle was my own brain."

Humans are the greatest distance runners on this planet, it's just that almost none of put that ability to use because there's no need for it anymore in day to day life."
4764,2020-10-01 06:40:23,j2wd3y,"It's your brain making a big deal of that. You start to sweat and pant which is expected as your body isn't used to it and needs time to adapt. It's your brain which is jumping up and down waving red flags and telling you to quit even though your body hasn't had a chance to get going.

Try slowly increasing your distance over time. Run 1, do one lap, run 2, 1.5 laps. Run 3, two laps etc. That way you can reassure your brain that there is an end in sight and it can stop panicking. As times goes your brain will know that you can actually do this and it will stop trying to make you quit."

I had two guys today learning the ropes on the bench next to me and they just messed up everything.. I had to ask both of them repeatedly if they could please stand behind their friend as they were standing about one foot from my bench and I couldn't do anything. Then they were sitting down on random machines trying to do a few reps while others were on their breaks between sets etc.



There's a dangerous confidence that comes from being with someone else who also doesn't know the etiquette and what's safe. When you're alone, you watch and learn. These guys were just in their own little world."

I would probably struggle to do 50 these days since I mostly bench now, but throw in some pushups now and then since they focus a lot on stabilizer muscles more than the bench press.

4789,2020-10-01 14:12:01,j2wd3y,"Buy one of those “pull up bands” they have them in several resistances, and by resistances, I guess I mean the inverse, or how much they “help” effectively reduce your weight on the pull-up. You can start with one of the bigger ones that takes ~100 pounds off your weight, and then when you can do, say, 3 sets of 10, switch to a smaller band that makes them a little harder, and repeat the process. Similarly, you can do “negatives” without a band if you have enough strength, but not enough to do full pullups. So you have a chair or step stool or something and you use that to bring yourself to the top of the rep, then slowly lower yourself in a controlled manner to the bottom of the rep, then repeat the process. The lifting yourself up is harder, but slowly lowering yourself is still good, and can help get you used to handling your own body weight, so this is a good way to get used to handling your own body weight.

Similarly, if you can’t do enough normal pushups, start on your knees. When you can do enough of them, switch to pushing up with your knees down, then lift them off the ground and lower yourself down with normal push-up form, then put your knees back down to press back up. This bridges the gap between knee and normal pushups, so can help you if you feel stuck between knee pushups being too easy, and normal pushups being too hard you can’t knock out more than a few reps at a time."

You need compound lifts for sure, to help build stabilizers and identify areas of weakness, but they aren't a good way to start.

Protein right after workout is very important, but there is nothing wrong with consuming 70% protein/fat leading up to your workout, whey right after your workout and your remaining carbs as your dinner.

Repeated experiences and/or trauma form our beliefs and more importantly (in this case) our habits. We are creatures of habit. Without purposely breaking our own mold, we will most definitely stay in it. This is why psychological therapy exists. The therapist attempts to create a healthy routine in your mind rather than the unhealthy mental routine you've fallen into.

Which is why you should listen to people who are educated on the subject, because they are the ones who understand the context, and what you are doing is the equivalent of going to the doctors saying ""well, I found this one article and I think treatment x is the best for me"". Read the whole chapter. Even better, if you have the time - read the whole book. It will take you more than a month but at least you'll be able to comprehend the basic ideas.

Motor unit recruitment can mean two things, I can't decipher from your comment which one you meant, so I'm gonna present the two: either you mean the slow connection of multiple nerve endings to different muscle fibers, resulting in larger motor units, as happens most dominantly after certain types of atrophies and neural damage (eg. Polio, as I've already stated, but can even happen in rare cases of paralysis from mechanical damage), or you meant ""size principle"", which basically means that the smaller motor units are excited first, and as the needed strength of contraction increases (or more realistically- as the signal strength increases), bigger motor units are ""recruited"", as in - excited. And honestly, I doubt you know which one of these two you meant, since from the style of your writing (which is way beyond the vocabulary and grammar you use both in different comments in this thread, as well as different comments under other health-related threads) it is evident you copy-pasted the sentence without actually trying to understand what was written. Its not that difficult to see.

However, you still haven't answered the question I asked you on a few occasions, which was what are your qualifications you once mentioned? It could help to identify the main source of contention in this discussion.

Also, please, if you could, don't just strip a single sentence out of some unknown research paper (from a journal with low ranking, if you know what it means) as your proof that science backs your claims. Sole sentence is not a generalized consensus. I presented you with statements that are taught in med school and that are agreed upon by the consensus of physiologists. You claim ""literature doesn't agree"", while in reality what you meant was your layman interpretation of a few select papers you found online (none of which you submitted except for one, from a low-impact factor journal). It is borderline lying at this point, and had you gone to university you would have learned that it is academically dishonest to publish false statements and mislead the viewer into believing one's opinions are the consensus of scientific majority, especially when lacking scientific sources.

You are doing the equivalent of ""I found this article you should look into"" that ""knowledgeable"" clients relay to specialists.

Edit: I also find it baffling that you forcefully try to prove me wrong, even though I studied what I'm talking about at the university, and you don't seem to have education in medical sciences. Although I could see how this type of arguments could go on and on with ethics, or philosophy, I don't really get how you haven't come to terms with the idea that people educated in the field can give you a better outlook on an idea than when you, an inexperienced person in the field, tries to do their own ""research"" into an advanced topic without knowing the basics. This is bound to fail, but I do appreciate the effort. Just for the next time, please refrain from ""doing research"" on an advanced topic from the field where you don't have the basic knowledge and understanding to operate amongst the terms. And the textbooks for university are much better at showing you the reality of situation than an article you fished to find to support your claim (which is literally how conspiracy theories arise)."

Even if we try our best to define masculinity as something that is positive (""men are caring, strong, they stand up for what's right""), where does that leave men who do not conform? Where does that leave men who are not caring, not strong, or don't stand up? Someone isn't more or less of a man just because they have or don't have certain traits. 

Even if the traits are undeniably positive, they need to be completely divorced from gender to be of any value."
4897,2020-09-29 22:27:49,j25na2,"I applaud the idea here, that there isn't a one size fits all set of traits on which men must conform, but at this point, it begs the question what then is masculinity not? (other than just some set of traits ""we don't like"") This seems so vague as to be pointless definitionally.  


And then from there, we want to ask what is the whole purpose of ""masculinity""? Why should I care what is or isn't masculine? At this point, I simply use the word to refer to what is typical of men, rather than what men should aspire to. One of my personal hobbies, crochet, isn't masculine, and that's fine. To me, that word is a clinical statement of objective observation."

There has always been a shifting variety of masculinities, and what one group might have identified as being masculine has always overlapped (to a greater or lesser extent, or not at all) with other groups. 
That said, I do agree with your pluralistic view of masculinities, and it’s definitely a well-written post.


Also, I think it’s really important to highlight that some positive and toxic masculinities can get all tangled up together - some positive masculine role models can still have problematic or toxic behaviours, and some negative or toxic masculine role models can still demonstrate positive masculinities. This doesn’t excuse the negative, or condemn all positive role models - it’s just something I think everyone should be aware of"

4901,2020-09-30 02:21:24,j25na2,"I don't disagree with the premise.  My issue with this is that it retains a gender-based division in the way we approach *humanity.*  Even using the word ""masculinity"" may be so deeply rooted in our cultures and societies, associated with so many negatives that we should be working to move past, that retaining it at all is more harmful than helpful.

We're humans.  We should be defined by our humanity, not masculinity or femininity.  Most of the behaviors we need to unlearn are socially and culturally ingrained, and many are gender-specific.  Approaching gender, sexuality, empathy, emotions, and emotional intelligence in a single unified manner, as universal *human* characteristics rather than male or female characteristics, will do more to break down the artificial barriers and promote real equality.

In general, fewer divisions between us is preferable.  Don't retain ""masculinity"" as a term at all.  It's had its run, and it caused so much harm.  Retire it.  Use unifying, universal terms wherever possible."
4902,2020-09-30 01:01:57,j25na2,"I've had a problem that I think extends from your issue. Occasionally I'll argue with someone over what toxic masculinity is, and they will ask what I think are good masculine traits bc they want to make me out to be someone who hates men and I get stumped. Trying to come up with positive masculine traits are hard, not because I think masculine traits are bad, but a lot of the good traditionally masculine traits aren't actually masculine. Stuff like being a good leader, or a protector, or a provider, or having strength of character or whatever else you can come up with, none of that is really masculine. If we say that's masculine, what about good women who are leaders, or providers or protectors? Its kind of acting like it's inherently male to have all these good important traits. 

Honestly I don't know what to say about it. Its a difficult subject. I do think we need to get rid of masculine and feminine traits as an idea, not in the like ""trans people need to get over their shit"" way. You can still be trans in a world that doesn't associate masculinity with leading and femininity with being loving. I think overall it would be a benefit, as trans people aren't the stereotype of their gender either. There would be no idea that a transman can't be caring because that's a feminine trait, they wouldn't have to think about it or even consider that someone might consider them more womanly because they are caring.

But baby steps, I'd be happy if everyone stopped associating manliness with not crying or hating on other men who aren't traditionally manly and other toxic traits. And honestly none of this matters if everyone would just realized that nothing matters so we should just be nice to others before the void consumes us."
4903,2020-09-29 21:01:45,j25na2,"While I appreciate the desire to further open gender expression for men so men also can accept and appreciate gender variance in self and others, at the end of the day, gender roles was a patriarchal control mechanism and so, they should go out the window completely. Ones genitals (sex) have nothing to do with ones expression of self and methods thereof (gender and personality). 

I desire a world where gender simply doesn’t exist and instead we process others through personality. Some of us are dominant or submissive, aggressive or passive, fixers, builders, nurturers or supporters, leaders or followers *at different times and circumstances* and that’s okay. We seek out and make relationships with others who compliment those expressions and needs. Done. BDSM in the LGBT community shows a good model of divorcing gender from personal power and preference expression. 

Ditch the patriarchy and all its constructs. Gender roles was a shitty, artificial, shortsighted, insecurity based manipulation of power dynamics. Let it die completely. Forge your own expression of personality. Your body is just a spacesuit for corporeal existence.

Edit: I’m trans masculine and not advocating terf bs. I’m saying real gender abolition would free everyone of gendered expectations, not setup a rigid sex binary or biology binary. What is male or female? Any answer inherently excludes anyone who doesn’t meet those definitions. After trying to meet everyone’s manliness expectations chemically, physically and socially, I found the definitions aren’t my gender, they’re my person and self actualzation and anyone can choose whatever characteristics they see fit.

4905,2020-09-29 21:52:04,j25na2,"I like the sentiment of this, but I think it raises the question- if masculinity is to fracture into multiple things that will all be called the same thing, what exactly qualifies them to be called masculinity? Which social expressions will you represent in these masculinities?

Obviously you can't say ""any and all"" because then you've basically nullified the term and made it useless; a word that conveys no information.

And, furthermore; say you *do* find a satisfactory answer and you manage to somehow capture the various expressions of being a man in this multifaceted system. Why could those definitions not fit all in one global notion of masculinity?

4908,2020-09-30 09:47:35,j25na2,"I agree that **positive masculinity** is a bad concept and want to dig into that.

The reason I don't like it is that it implies that I owe this to someone or something. Be that myself, society, women, family, community? Oh really, says who?

It's absolutely apparent how machismo, toxic masculinity and so forth is something to evolve away from as it's example of things that can cause harm both to myself and others. But then again, some parts of unhealthy/forced masculinity is the idea of that you yourself come second to those which you provide for. Positive masculinity doesn't do away with that. I'd actually argue proponents of it often don't want to.

I don't mind being a ""productive citizen"", I don't mind to contribute to community and those I care about but if there's ever even a slight element of ""Please step into the typical man shoes as it'd be really convenient for us right now"" while it means I take damage, either physically or to my self-esteem.... I'm absolutely out! No negotiation or compromise.

Many point out that the problem with positive masculinity is that it becomes gender essentialist, which is true. If you slice off the ""positive"" from the equation, it's value neutral and can just be about mannerisms, physicality, esthetics or one-way-of-many-of doing-things(equally valid)... in a way which can also include trans men without any problem.

But positive masculinity, my problem with it aside from being essentialist, is that it's set up as a tool of taking advantage of men, dupe men into finding gratification of an arbitrary self-image and direction, while others extract use from it.

So to me, that masculinity (not defined negative) needs to be both a flexible concept but above all: *value neutral*

It doesn't matter if you have it or you don't. I would say broad shoulders is masculine but if you don't have broad shoulders, it doesn't matter to anything. It has no objective value.

As for masculine activities and qualities, it's up to you and only you if you want to or not. 100% optional and nobody is ever in their right to demand it of you.

4909,2020-09-30 13:40:51,j25na2,"I do think that positive masculinity is kind of a misstep.  Part of it is because it's a bad name.  Another part is because it doesn't make sense.

If toxic masculinity ,a cursed phrase that I wish never existed, is bad, and positive masculinity is good,  then what is masculinity?  

Positive masculinity usually means non toxic.  It feels like trading one box of stereotypes for another one.  Which doesn't feel right to me personally, or a lot of men who don't spend an inordinate amount of time on the internet reading about gender roles.

Toxic masculinity is a problem, but the message that we're told is, ""Men are broken and need to be fixed, no matter how woke you become, you'll never be 100 percent fixed."" That's  unattractive and really unhelpful.

We keep forgetting that for the men outside this sub, nay, outside of social media, the ones who balk at all this elephant talk, this narrow form of masculinity is all they know.

The way things are going at the moment, I can forsee a time when traditional names will be replaced by an acronym descibing your entire personality, mental and physical traits.

They simply broadened the ways people could ""acceptably"" be a woman. Women can wear pants because  people no longer see pant-wearing as inherently contradictory to womanhood. Now of course its not a perfect system and you could say its just widening the existing boxes that we put ourselves in and that there are still masculine behaviors, interests, and modes of expression that  still clash with conventional ideas of womanhood. But I think what has happened has done a lot of good in making womanhood a more hospitable place for different types of women.

Basically, the theory is there is a dominate ‘hegemonic’ masculinity that all other masculinities are positioned in relation to as “subordinate” masculinities. The closer an embodied masculinity reflects the hegemonic masculinity, the more power and social purchase a person has. But, the key is the dominate masculinity is very rarely actually embodied by anyone, including those who meet the criteria (in our case, straight, white, male). rather, it is by design unattainable. The current hegemonic masculinity is what people think of when they think of manliness, manhood, patriarchy, and toxic masculinity. But subordinate masculinities are how people actually behave."

While I appreciate much of that sentiment, I would like to play devil's advocate for a minute. I have a relation to something called ""masculine"" as well as something called ""feminine"", whether they are byproducts of my upbringing, constructs of one form or another, or some innate essence; they are internalized concepts. Kind of like archetypes in a way. I suspect that these things are highly individualized, that your idea and relationship to masculinity (and/or femininity) may be similar to mine in many ways, but wildly different in others. I think it can be highly beneficial to engage with these differences and get a sense how they work in other people. Indeed, I think a large aspect to any interpersonal relationship is gaining insight on how the other perceives and navigates the world. 

Where we undoubtedly go wrong with these things is in our predominantly one-dimensional depictions of them that are prescriptive rather than descriptive. We don't ask what masculinity and femininity are to people, we tell them. We have a societal obsession with precise language, that all terms must be objectively defined, which works great for science, engineering and other such fields that require that level of objectivity, but human experience is predominantly subjective. We need subjective language in order to relate what we cannot objectively communicate, about what is internal to our experience and reality.

So I think instead of thinking about individual values and expressions of masculinity, we should instead be talking about freedom, liberation from conformity.

In my opinion, the men you've mentioned as examples of good role models do have something in common - the freedom, confidence and self assurance to chart their own path.

I think also this sub tends to get hung up on the concept of masculinity far far more than the feminist subs I hang out in. The assumption over there is a) not all women have femininity b) there are many different expressions of femininity inside of and in opposition to traditional gender roles. 

I think losing the idea of a set ""good masculinity"", and even ""individual masculinity"" is where men need to go. Like, feminist 101 for women is ""stop caring about how feminine you are (esp. compared to others) and just be yourself"". Men kind of need to get there too imo?"

""What is my masculinity?"" This question is the wrong place to start, within nearly every circle I can think of it is always presupposed that man SHOULD be masculine or that we should get in touch with out gender expression but I actually strongly disagree.

Whenever doing any personal soul searching the very core of everything I do always begins with ""What makes me happy?"", this is a question I firmly believe less people can answer than it may initially appear, this is why people end up in unfulfilling relationships, stuck in jobs they hate, and wandering through life without purpose.

The question of ""How to express my masculinity"" should only be relevant once you establish masculinity is something you can personally actually draw value from.

To give a personal example, I've always been a slightly strange person in that I've very rarely given a fuck about what people around me tell me, if you want to change my opinion of something I am or doing you need to have earned my respect beforehand because there are too many people with too many opinions to listen to everything. As a result of this when trans issues started gaining traction I had a genuine sit down and wondered if I was either trans or non binary, because I have never really considered myself ""a dude"" in any tangible sense, but after getting my thoughts in line I came to the conclusion that the answer to this question actually doesn't matter, because gender expression is almost non existent to me, it's not something I consider to have any value to me.

In summary, maybe I am non-binary, but it doesn't matter, it would not affect my life, nor would it change anything I do.

The most important thing at the end of the day is being internally honest with yourself. YOU have to know whether Masculinity is something you even care about before you can answer any questions to do with what masculinity is or should be to you."

Masculinity has always been several and manifold: the scholar, the sportsman, and the warrior would be the characters I think most little boys aspire to be- at least 70%.

These have definitions which are much more mutable. Here are some quick notes on each.

— the Scholar should become less of an expert, he needs to be the well rounded academic. A scientist who reads the Bhagavad Ghita and Greek literature, as well as being always up to date on the philosophy of the day. Familiarity with the French and the feminists inspired by them: Butler, Irigaray. Examples include, Zizek and Kotkin. (Included pretty much the whole sane political spectrum with that.)

The sportsman, also could include rappers, also must be pushed to read outside their obsession. Greater breadth of working knowledge of the world will lead to more options within the chosen skill anyways. But it should be done to advance socially thoughtful winners: Brother Ali, and Lebron James are shining examples.

Finally, the warrior. Fighting picks some boys, in which case all of these people must become Zen like General Mattis. A warrior scholar who wins when he fights and fights only when he must. The others, pick war and conflict having been amazed by tales of conquerors past. These boys must also be made Zen, but by a different path than the ‘born’ fighters.

We need both of them to make sure that all men are allowed to feel comfortable with truly being themselves AND that they are allowed to try on whatever role they want, no matter how that authentic self is expressed. 

It should be OK for men to be less assertive, emotional and shy - without being shamed for it. But that person should also be allowed to try to become a leader, despite all of these traits. They should be allowed to develop their own style of leadership that's effective and true to themselves."

And while that can take different forms in different places and times, it is still always an appreciable (if not strict) metric within its context.

As such, I'd tweak your idea and say that, in the case of the Queer Eye hosts for example, they're actually not all unquestionably masculine. The idea that masculinity is this subjective thing that is just whatever any particular man happens to do doesn't actually work since it waters down the definition to the point of meaninglessness (and it doesn't work for Jonathan Van Ness in particular since he doesn't actually identify as a man). It also doesn't work because it harshly contradicts people's experience-based intuitions (for example, most Americans would say that Jonathan is clearly less masculine than, say, Antoni) making it less useful as a term. 

Instead, I think it's better to recognize that no, they're not all masculine, but that's okay because they don't need to be. They do exhibit a spectrum of masculinity, but they also exhibit a good amount of femininity (and otherwise), and the fact that they embody that diversity and promote it in the people they help is what makes them a great example of counteracting toxic (hegemonic) masculinity."

This would result in multiple masculinities, but it would also open the doors to many forms of gender expression not traditionally considered as being masculine. In my mind, post-masculinity acknowledges that masculinity is a social construct, and that it can mean different things to different people. Therefore, every single man on earth has an understanding of masculinity that is unique to him. If we lean into the subjective and personal nature of masculinity, we get a form of masculinity that can be shaped and changed by each individual in order to suit their needs. This also completely disables toxic masculinity since  it allows for all men to safely seperate their understanding of masculinity from the traditional model perpetuated by our patriarchal society."

However I don't think we should be too hasty in giving up on the ideal of something shared between us. Now I make this point, specifically, in response to your last sentences... where you suggest we should ask the question of ""what is my masculinity"" rather than the question ""what is positive masculinity"".

This question has within it a potential pathway to a toxic individualism, wherein we disregard any shared nature/experience/identity/whatnot in favour of whatever a ""floats my boat"" unconcerned with the state of men/society generally.

Note I am not suggesting your intention is that we end up in such a space, dominated by a radical Ayn Rand style Libertarianism... Rather I worry that the way you have framed your position allows us to go there without due concern for others.

There is virtue in not being concerned with following along with the crowd, which has been the source of many problems within the legacy of masculinity... it allows you to break away from those problematic traditions. Which is necessary, but not blindly following the crowd doesn't mean we should be quick keep to give up on them. 

People (many of them) need an ideal to work towards, it gives them a goal, purpose and a means by which to measure personal growth. It is potentially dangerous (considering how many young men find themselves vulnerable to being radicalised by far right ideologues globally) to allow the collective ideal of masculinity to be defined by agendas. 

I strongly feel the crisis of modern masculinity is behind too many men finding themselves in hate groups... those groups give boys a goal, an enemy, and a simple black and white picture of the world and their place within it. These boys need a group to belong to and they feel that belonging is denied too them in the confusion of what it is to be a man in the modern world.

There are however differences between men and women developed over millennia of evolution and societal roles.

As the spare in a family unit combined with an average greater degree of strength, speed and stamina compared to our female counterparts added to different body chemistry and brain processes our roles wind up being different.

If we are defining masculine characteristics it has to acknowledge that we have evolved to be different than women. If a trait is to be masculine then it has to acknowledge those differences. It also has to acknowledge that there will be variation in how masculinity can be expressed.

It's primarily an exterior entity: our gender system labels some people as men and polices the so-labeled in a way that punishes them if they don't conform to the prescribed gender role we call masculinity. Pretending masculinity is merely an internal psychological state obscures the gender-reifying emotional violence that the people-so-labeled are subjected to by society, from strangers to co-workers to family members to friends to romantic partners.

Saying that masculinity is just everything that a person identifying as a man does ignores that it is, in fact, socially prescribed and that you will be punished if you deviate from it. To me, it's similar to someone saying they don't see race: sure, maybe you have the social privileges to be able to say that all male behaviors are valid masculinities, but the lived experiences of the rest of us tell us that no, there's only a narrow set of behaviors and gender presentations that a man can perform and still expect to be treated as a valid human being."

I think for many of us, that's the point. Currently, masculinity is an important part of many people's identity, and it can be used to guide and inspire them towards healthy goals. But it can also be used to restrict, shame and harm. The more we expand the acceptable definitions of masculinity, the smaller that power to restrict becomes. Ultimately, this may dilute the power of the idea of masculinity to inspire as well, but it will happen over enough time for people to adapt and won't demand that people strip away an important part of their personal identity."

While identifying as my very own unique brand of a spacesuit for corporeal existence is cute, what would I really gain from having to describe exactly the combinations of personal characteristics I find attractive because I won't be able to just say ""I'm into dudes""?

And how will you enforce this removal of gender thoroughly enough, so that the majority people don't just organically divide themselves into two main categories and basically just be men and women with different names?

It's very hard to exactly define being a man or a woman without mentioning sex or stature, that's for certain. But for a lot of people, these definitions mean a lot.

Please do not take your experience (gender has no meaning) and assume that that is universal. Saying that gender is just a patriarchal control mechanism is, frankly, offensive."

People should be able to choose which roles they want to do and to what extent they want to do them. And it should be completely fine for them to change labels and roles as they see fit. It's only when labels are used prescriptively to force gender roles and expectations on people that there's a problem. 

Also, gender absolutely exists. I'm non-binary, and there's a fundamental part of my identity that I can only really comprehend when I look at it through the lens of gender identity, and can only really describe when I use gender-based words. Robbing me of that language is cruel, and erases that part of my identity. I've had depression for years because I had no words to describe that part of myself, and I wouldn't appreciate a world where that's forced upon me again.

Some psychological theories about emotion propose a two-axis framework: valence (positive/negative) and arousal (energetic/lethargic). Positive-energetic is excitement, positive-lethargic is contentment, negative-lethargic is depression, and negative-energetic is anger.  
If you're experiencing anger then you're in an aroused state and should work off that energy before talking whatever it is out."

That same trait may be a feminine trait to someone else, some way that they understand themselves to be what they are. In that sense, the only limitations on what traits are masculine or feminine is what the individual identifies with. It becomes a descriptive label rather than a prescriptive one. And obviously that understanding is a problem if one then externalizes it to define others. It’s a personal understanding that doesn’t really extend beyond the self. 


So traits themselves stop having any kind of exclusive relationship with one gender or another and instead have a relationship to the individual that identifies with it, one way or another. It’s muddier but hey, the world’s got a lot of mud in it and I’ve never seen any flower grow that didn’t start in some mud. I don’t know if it’s the endpoint of the discussion of gender but it feels like a step in the right direction; not denying anyone their identity if they find comfort and solidarity in being one thing rather than another but respecting and seeing people for who they truly are, not what we expect them to be when we see an F or an M next to their name."

I wouldn’t have thought of myself as non binary, I just think of myself as... a man in the purely descriptive sense... but maybe ‘a male’ would work better. But I have absolutely never found any way to identify with or find useful concepts of ‘being a man’ or masculinity, for precisely the reasons OP put out. Any consideration of ‘what could be my positive masculinity’ or positive masculine traits, just leads to a list of things that are... good human qualities.

I can see the problem from what trans people are saying about feeling they are a specific gender, but I’m not sure how to reconcile it with that feeling/perception on my part. I suppose than an argument here that my place in the world, conforming so closely to presenting as a male or a man, there is a lot of stuff that is kind of invisible to me, and my identity isn’t problematised or challenged by the people around me? Maybe if it was I’d feel different? Does that lie somewhere in the gap between abstract qualities and how we’re allowed to perform/carry them out? Would masculinity or feminine identity be more more important to me if I felt stronger desire towards certain expressions or ways of being in the world that were policed? That’s the only time I really feel in contact with concerns over ‘masculinity’ - when I’m specifically being judged for not being something, or afraid that I lack something (usually romantically or in dating).

The problem is, being man or woman don't actually have any identifiable traits beyond social constructs. That means that whatever we attribute to them invalidates the identity of those in that group who do not match those criteria.

For example if we say ""men are strong"" then we are saying that those who are not strong are not men.

The idea that we can assign traits to entire genders is problematic in itself, since genders do not share traits - they don't even exist in the first place.

Another example for you, you say ""I am attracted to men"", but what useful information does that imply? It means there's around 4 billion people on earth you could be attracted to? Surely your attraction is a little more nuanced than that isn't it? There are all kinds of potentially sexist and transphobic problems with claiming attraction to a gender, I think it would be far more productive to say you are attracted to X, Y, Z, kind of person, or better yet not search for labels, just talk about traits or specific people.

I'm a 30 white male who grew up in Montreal, so my parent mostly only grew up with white people but when I grew up it was cosmopolitan enough that I was an actual minority in school (fun fact), so my parents did what they thought was the best and they raised me thinking that everybody is the same, whites, blacks, yellows, the colour of our skin don't matter: there are no races, it's a made up concept - so be good with everybody.

>It is very difficult to come up with a single consistent definition for something really basic

Exactly. It's a very fundamental separation that really only serves to let us know whether something belongs in it or not. However, for something to belong, it needs certain characteristics- if *anything* can be allowed to belong, then that horse really *is* a chair after all. But it's not. We all know what a chair is, machine learning can clearly learn what a chair is, we understand something is a chair even if it's designed in a strange shape, therefore somewhere there is a functional definition that is flexible enough so that it doesn't create constant conflicts on whether something is a chair or not, but also specific enough that we can intuitively understand it.

>At its core here, what I'm proposing is a kind of descriptivism, instead of prescriptivism when we talk about gender. If you compare all the various ways that people express their masculinity, you're going to find similarities between most men.

I feel like you may be on to something here, but then you lose me.

What's the functional difference here between a descriptive and a prescriptive definition of a man? Saying what men ""are"" and what men ""should be"" is basically the same thing in this case.

Also, if you compare the ways most men express their masculinity and you do indeed find similarities in most men, then why don't we just call *that* ""masculinity"" and leave all the rest to personal interpretation?

>However, if someone is a bit more out there in their gender expression, that doesn't mean they're doing it wrong.

Ok, but where do you draw the line between ""out there"" and ""not a man""? E.g. would my mother, a rather conventional woman who identifies as one, pass for an acceptable man (if not a bit ""out there""), if she simply changed the label she identifies with and nothing else about her?"

It goes back to Goffman's observation that there is one ""unblushing male"" with an impossible list of qualifications for being a man. Or Pleck's gender role strain theory that the process to become a man is impossible, damaging, and once achieved (however imperfectly) does more harm than good to himself and those around him.

My point is I think we need to stop demanding of ourselves and others that we attain some notion of masculinity and just be who we want to be. Instead of a masculine man a caring man, a nerdy man, a party loving man, a sporty man, or whatever other kind of man we want.

Under a paradigm like what u/bareboneslite is suggesting, if a person feels the need to cultivate masculinity in themselves (that is, traits and behaviors that are typical of men) they can have the freedom to that or not and it will have no bearing on whether or not they are a man."

5030,2020-10-01 00:17:00,j25na2,"Thanks for yr question. I'm not trying to be combative, either. Just hoping to add a bit to this conversation, to have a more nuance discussion, as it's something i've thought a lot about it. 

I came into the discussion around Men's Issues via feminism. I live in a progressive American West Coast city and a great majority, probably all of, my friends are ardent feminists, both women and men. Many of my friends are rather younger than i, in their late 20s, and are more well-versed in some of the more cutting-edge thoughts and philosophies around gender and sexuality. 

Coming at this from a feminist viewpoint, where we're currently at within feminism, at least by my take and understanding, is some variant on ""choice feminism,"" (which has some problems with it, as well.) Which is to say that it's not feminism's job or purpose to force women to be one way or the other. Consider the conversations around sex- and body-positivity as examples. The goal is to make it so that women don't feel excluded or punished for not adhering to the societal expectations. 

Within that framework, there's a subset of women who are into more traditionally ""feminine"" things, baking, crafting, homemaking, beautification. There was a time when these feminists felt excluded, ostracized, and pressured to be or behave a certain way or they're not real feminists. Some voices emerged saying its their choice and their right to fulfill more traditional women's roles, like being a stay-at-home parent. It's not our job, nor our goal, to tell these women they can't be. 

That being said, there are some of these women who take great pride and joy in being women. I suspect that telling them their gender no longer exists or they're not allowed to be or express their personal gender would not be welcomed. Nor would it by transfeminine people who *are* identifying on the gender binary spectrum, as has been evidenced by a number of transmasculine people on this thread. 

Thus, gender abolition is not the only goal or outcome of this way of thinking. It's not our job or our place to say that identity doesn't matter, it clearly does, to a lot of people.

Therefore, my hope, and my goal, is to help each individual find their own relationship with gender and identity. Personally, when asked, i'm somewhere on the genderfluid spectrum but mostly live my life as a gender non-conforming man, with a penchant to lean towards the feminine. That being said, i still value my masculinity, which has largely been shaped by men that i've known throughout my life, with maybe a smattering of public features. 

I'm on-board with the masculinities concept. I grew up in the 80s in the American midwest and my life was made pretty damn miserable by toxically masculine people. I'd like to see the ideas expand beyond just the one masculine ideal, which so often leads to toxic masculinity, but numerous kinds of men. I'm still fleshing out the idea but is largely based around the book *Gods In Everyman* by Jean Shinoda Bolen, which is based around a Jungian interpretation of archetypes, using the Greco-Roman Gods as a model. Personally, i'm not much of an Ares, red-blooded man type - i don't like sports or rough-housing or competition much. But i *am* rather like Hermes/Mercury and Dionysus (can't remember if he's in the book  or not. He's also rather genderfluid, so not entirely a God or ""masculine"" per se.) I want to see multiple expressions of masculinity celebrated, with healthy and positive role models and examples of each.

Hope that helps clarify my position, and thanks again for the inquiry."
5031,2020-09-30 21:25:38,j25na2,"Yes there are negative gendered traits, but I'm saying that when we talk about toxic masculinity, what we're talking about is generally a type of behavior that centers around the policing of men and boys' masculinity, not necessarily specific traits of masculinity itself. So when we ridicule boys for showing feminine attributes, or tell them to man up when they cry, or encourage them to bully other boys and girls, these are all examples of toxic masculinity at work. But that doesn't mean that ridicule, denial of pain, and bullying are traits inherent to masculinity itself. So when the person in Suspicious-Metal's example retorts that they should name positive masculine attributes, I'm suggesting the answer should be that masculinity is neither good nor bad in itself, but it's how you use it and relate to it that can be positive or negative."
5032,2020-09-29 22:51:28,j25na2,"More or less. For some of us it was a massive struggle. Let me fill in with my own context.

I only realized I was transgender by the time I was nearly 28. The last five or so years of that in particular was a massive downward spiral for me because on a deep psychological level any future I tried to imagine for myself (because I was imaging myself as my AGAB - Assigned Gender At Birth) not only felt hollow, but cut me off from ""the prospect of the future"" from being able to motivate me, eventually culminating in chronic Depersonalization (which most descriptions of neglect to mention how common it can be in trans people - and thus often go undiagnosed for years).

That detachment continued to being completely numb to my own emotions or have them incredibly muted *most* of the time (with periodic breaks), a more or less inability to feel motivation, and finally a detachment from easily being able to delegate movement... it felt like I had to manually direct movement on the deliberate level a lot more, which is incredibly taxing to be doing *all of the time.*

After having to crawl my mental health back from all of that, I *understand* how deeply ingrained one's sense of gender is (and how damaging it is to be **wrong** about what yours is), whereas most cisgender people at best *know* that it is."

5036,2020-09-30 14:16:52,j25na2,"I understand this perspective, but on the other hand—gender is tiring. So fucking tiring. 

I understand wanting to defend your gender. I've been called male quite frequently throughout my life because I refuse to wear make-up,  don't wear dresses/skirts, and I don't get my eyebrows done regularly due to COVID. 

It is not that I find it insulting to be called male or  even that I'm dysphoric when I'm called he/him—FFS, for my wedding I ordered a made-to-measure tux because I just find it more comfortable to wear shorts and a jacket. I think it looks cool and that's about it. Dresses and skirts don't work for my proportions and I don't like the way they feel on my body. 

But its the perceptions that come along with gender that I find annoying. I do not desire to be a man. I do not want a penis. I am not butch, a boi, masc, a bulldyke, or any of the other words people use to describe people that look like me—yet, I've always felt pushed to ID in these ways because I don't fit into the traditional female box. 

At some points its been stupid enough that depending on the state I'm in, I get weird looks going into a female bathroom and I have a vagina :/

I can sort of relate to trying to ""find a womanhood"" but then I gave up because what is the point? People are equal and I am just coincidentally a woman, I owe no one proof that I am woman enough, whatever that may mean. I do not care about society's perceptions of me. I am also not nonbinary and I find it important for people to understand that you can look like me, be black and be a woman. Race and gender are very uniquely tied in that way and I wish they weren't.

I just want a world that doesn't even know I was born with a vagina. A world where I don't know other people's genitalia either. Because it doesn't matter unless you're a doctor or you're fucking that person (and sometimes I wonder how much this matters innately vs societally).  

I can understand the fight to be seen as your gender, I really do. But I'm largely tired of participating in this fight and I just want gender to go away. It is a hindrance on my life right now and has never been useful for me. I imagine I would largely feel the same way if I'd been born with a penis."
5037,2020-09-30 06:50:31,j25na2,"If I'm reading what you mean by that, absolutely. I think that infancy and adolescence especially should not be anywhere near as heavily gendered as is. To go back into personal examples again:

I have memories of taking an faux-emerald necklace to the checkout isle, only to have my stepfather make me return it and get something else because it was ""too girly"". My father might have been more flexible around these things, but his ""I'm worried that bullies will target you over [fem stuff]"" at an early age ended up really getting me to repress some of my more femme-coded inclinations. Forcing me to cut my hair shorter as well. At a pretty impressionable age, it contributed to supressing my ability to explore things that would have made my transness a lot faster.

Beyond that, I'm not against fecognizing things as traditionally masculine or feminine, so long is as the expectation that one adheres to their gender's traditional trapping is completely nullified at the social pressure angle.

'Being a man is something that covers a LOT of ground, and some men rock pink dresses.'

There are trans men who still love dresses, but are understanably concerned with the public considering their transition invalid for it... And I don't need to explain to all of us who are 'men or otherwise AMAB' that a *lot* of other men in this current day and age still have a serious and sometime violent stick up their ass about that kind of thing."

Still, these people still identify as men and if we were to meet them IRL I'm sure we'd be able to tell that most of them are men, so there clearly are certain fundamental characteristics that don't rely on men identifying as ""protectors"" etc. that still differentiate men from women and everything else."

5042,2020-09-30 02:25:09,j25na2,"> That means that whatever we attribute to them invalidates the identity of those in that group who do not match those criteria. 

This I disagree with. Assuming genders do have a raison d'etre (I'll address the other option in a bit), theoretically if we strip them of all toxic and obsolete bullshit we should remain with a core of the bare minimum essential traits, that should flexibly encompass every type of man or woman, respectively.

> Another example for you, you say ""I am attracted to men"", but what useful information does that imply? It means there's around 4 billion people on earth you could be attracted to? 

Hm. I suppose it actually means that there are around another 4 billion people I'm *not* attracted to. Someone being a man is a necessary condition for me to be attracted to him, but not sufficient.

> Surely your attraction is a little more nuanced than that isn't it? There are all kinds of potentially sexist and transphobic problems with claiming attraction to a gender 

Obviously I look for more nuanced traits, like everyone. Most people are monosexual. This doesn't mean they're attracted to the ENTIRE population of their gender of preference, but it's a pretty safe way to narrow down.

>The problem is, being man or woman don't actually have any identifiable traits beyond social constructs. 

Ah, now *this* is a truly ballsy point worth discussing. If you take away all the unnecessary secondary traits from gender, will you be left with the essences of masculinity and femininity, or absolutely nothing?

And let me follow up with two more questions: if genders don't really exist as axioms, as you posit, but they are only arbitrary constructs, do masculinity and femininity themselves exist? And if *they* do not, does sexuality have a point then?"

I am not arguing that anyone else’s gender or gender expression infringes on mine - that is the transphobic argument (“You don’t have a penis or testicles so you aren’t a man because that’s how I define manhood.”).  

I am arguing here that nullifying my gender identity - “Let’s throw out the entire concept of gender and no one will have any gender at all” - is actually forcing a gender identity (agender - which is a real gender identity) on me and anyone else who isn’t agender.

I think the answer to that is a resounding yes. I believe OP is suggesting that characteristics of self-identified masculine people are what makes up masculinity. 

To continue the thought experiment. If your mother identified as male, then there is presumably a reason for which they assign themselves this identity. That reasoning is part of their masculinity and we should consider those traits/feelings/etc. a part of the category of masculinity. 

Even though these will, of course, differ from our individual descriptions of masculinity I believe we need to operate as though all self assignment is in good faith. Given that gender is a social construct, it should also not surprise us when others assign different traits in themselves or others as masculine based on their experiences and worldview.

5050,2020-09-30 15:18:48,j25na2,"Self harm. 

In my experience, women turn anger inward on themselves and men turn anger outward—and generally speaking, anger for men can be used to mask other emotions they're feeling because anger is acceptable while being sad isn't. For women, being angry isn't typically acceptable but other emotions (or really no emotions) is perfectly fine. 

Both are very harmful and can lead to destructive behaviors.

For example, my girlfriend was not allowed to express anger growing up. She turned all of her anger into other emotions like sadness and that grew into depression until she ended up attempting suicide several times and also harmed herself and developed an eating disorder.

My father, on the other hand, was also never allowed to express emotions growing up. But he was allowed to be angry so he turned those emotions into anger and lashed out everyone around him, including me and my siblings.

You should be allowed to feel your emotions. CBT is incredibly useful for learning to identify and express emotions in a healthy, non destructive way. For those who cannot afford CBT I highly recommend the Anxiety Notebook. It's under $25 and covers just about everything a therapist would teach you without the actual therapist."
5051,2020-09-29 21:58:13,j25na2,"I think it's a little dismissive to call anyone who doesn't currently identify as non-binary, and is not willing to do basically that, ""fearful of change"". I'm all for progress, and I'm ready to support any change that has a point.

However, abolishing the notion of gender altogether has an unbelievable opportunity cost, it will make many people unhappy and to question if who they are is valid, many will oppose it and continue using genders by the same or different names, enforcing this will be absolute hell without a doubt, and all of this to gain what? To stop people from judging others?

I'm pretty sure that can be done without so much upheaval, just so we can say we radically rebranded and we're not ""Patriarchy 2.0"". I don't mind the words. I'll gladly live in Heteronormativity 2.0 if it's updated to give me equal treatment and acceptance (though I guess its name would be a little ironic then)."
5052,2020-09-30 03:16:50,j25na2,But it is not about the demanding is about the ones that want. If masculinity has a precise definition there is always a chance of excluding their gender expression.

Gender roles and labeling things masculine vs feminine will inevitably force people into feeling like they have to fit into one of those categories. In fact I think abolishing gender as a concept could be beneficial to society.

However I also think if we try and get rid of masculinity and feminity right now, not only is it going to be extremely hard, it will also have negative impacts on the trans community. Right now having things that are masculine/feminine can help trans people feel at home with their gender and community. Once we get to a state where the whole of society can accept people who don't fit into the cis category as full people, then I think we can pursue getting rid of masculinity and femininity and other gender specific labels. 

Right now we can provide better examples of masculinity and femininity as well as stressing that you don't have to fit in with all or any of these labels/stereotypes/whatever you want to call it. It's not the be all end all solution, but it's a good step towards a better society."

5055,2020-09-30 21:45:20,j25na2,"All traits are human traits, but that doesn't stop them from being typical of men or women. Having a large amount of facial hair is a human thing, but it's also a masculine thing. The ability to lactate is a human trait, but it's also a feminine one. And even when it comes to psycho-social things like an affinity for aggression or for discussing feelings, these can often be correlated with men or women generally.

And yes, ideas about what is masculine or feminine do differ from culture to culture, but a) there is still always a sense of some things being masculine or feminine, and b) there is actually quite a lot of overlap in what things are considered masculine or feminine cross-culturally. But even if there wasn't, the fact remains that within any given cultural context, traits that are typically masculine or typically feminine can be identified.

But the ultimate point of my comment was that regardless of this fact, that still shouldn't mean that we try to force people to conform to specific views of how people ought to act based on their gender. It's possible to recognize that masculinity and femininity exist and also think that they shouldn't be binding social structures."
5056,2020-09-30 21:02:28,j25na2,"I'm not advocating for a prescriptive labeling of norms, I'm talking about descriptive observation. For example, it's a clearly attested trend that boys tend to prefer rough, physically aggressive play, and games or sports that facilitate that, while girls tend not to (or at least enjoy it less). So it's fair to say that that mode of play is more masculine than feminine in general. Where toxic gender roles come into play is when we tell boys that they HAVE TO enjoy those things even if they don't, and girls that they CAN'T enjoy those things even when they do. I also don't think we need to obsessively label things as gendered when we talk about them socially. Like, we don't need to call roughhousing ""masculine play"" even if does correlate more with boys, we can just let it be what it is.

And the average person will always feel pressure to fit in; that's human nature. What's important is, like I said, giving people space to be whoever they want. We don't have to pretend like masculinity doesn't exist, or that most boys and men aren't masculine, we just have to consistently tell children that they are valid in their identities regardless of how much like other kids they are. If that means that someone will try to change themselves to fit the norm, then they should be free to do that, as long as they know that they always have room to stop doing that (and as long as they don't insist on policing other peoples' gender expression in the same way)."

Edit: I get that toxic masculinity does not mean that all masculinity is toxic and I like your definition about centering the discussion of the phrase around policing, but sometimes it seems like people are implying that *most* negative human traits are inherently coded as masculine, thus toxic masculinity, rather than just a negative human trait."

In my opinion, there isn't. If we strip away the masculinity social construct, then besides ""being men"", men don't share anything.

For this reason, masculinity and femininity are purely social constructs to me. Crucially, even if they weren't, I am not sure that their existence is a good thing since, as I said, it is constraining.

Does sexuality have a point? Yes, but not in respect to gender. I think it's important to remember that sexuality is about attraction to actual people. For example if you are attracted to ""men"", there is still a big difference to being attracted to ""butch"" or ""femme"" are vastly different. Redefining your sexuality in more granular and non-gendered terms is the way forward IMO."

Plenty of people live within the gender system, plenty of people enjoy it, and plenty of people tie their identity directly to their gender identity. However it also harms a many many people. Gender based discrimination is rampant, and people who do not conform to the gender's stereotypes face massive hardship.

I don't want to suppose your experiences, but I suspect that like me you have also felt societal pressures and oppression for not fitting into a gender role that society has assigned to you."

I'm losing track of all of the sub-threads in this conversation so I'll iterate this once again: If any person, with literally any form of self-expression, is considered to be a man as long as they say they are one, then there is no reason for anyone to want the label anymore.

A label that automatically includes anyone and everyone that will have it, is simply not an ""identity"" anymore. There's zero reason to ""want"" to be a man, because being one doesn't differentiate you from anyone, in any way, and that's... kinda the point of identity.

Also, separate from the above, personally I don't trust any system that runs on good faith. Even if people weren't dumb and/or assholes and didn't abuse an ""anything goes"" system, you leaving it to them to understand what being a man is, and self-assign as such if needed, is a cop-out from the conversation, I'm sorry. :P You basically transferred the onus of pinpointing masculinity, which we're trying to do, to the general population and just leave it to them to place themselves in or out of it, *hoping* they'll do this in good faith, while you pretend that you're *technically* letting everyone in.

>question if who they are is valid

I mean, that's the main problem isn't it? Relying on external validation, which usually is pretty nonsensical and toxic.

We as dudes know, we are told from little kids to be pretty much assholes, and if you don't , or don't like mainstream ""boy"" things, you are bullied and called ""girly"" ( or directly a homo )

So in that spectrum, what is validation?
We will never be truly ourselves trying to please everyone else.

I really like the idea of ""gender isn't identity"", I am just learning about it, and nobody really likes it, gender is way too rooted into our way of thinking, but I think there is something good in it.

>many will oppose it and continue using genders by the same or different names

I don't expect people to change themselves, I don't want to change myself either, after all, we are already shaped by society, the damage is already done.

If it works to redefine masculinity in such a way that it describes anyone and anything and people feel fulfilled by that, then by all means let's do it. I'm just skeptical that it would work. Does it hold any meaning to belong to a group that literally anyone can be in? I guess it could. So yeah, masculinities for everyone. But does it get around the fact that some differences are (stubbornly and incorrectly) held with higher regard than others? I fear it doesn't. And that's where we should target our efforts.

Yes, the physiological stuff like secondary sex characteristics are certainly associated with either male or female bodies. But gender performance is different than biology and culturally conditioned into a person, whether they realize it or not. I don't think we should underestimate the power that gendered expectations/ideas have over someone.

I agree somewhat with your last paragraph; we shouldn't try to force someone to emulate what we think a gender should perform. But I believe that even associating traits with a gender causes this pressure to a degree; this (made up) association causes gendered behaviors to occur in the first place.

Edit: for example, any behaviors I practice, I learn and am then able to perform. Every individual, not gender, has behaviors they feel more comfortable with, most likely based on how much they have practiced them and how acceptable they feel that behavior is in any given social situation. I think it's most accurate and helpful to look at people as unique individuals and not groupings based on arbitrary physical characteristics."

And I'm generally way more concerned with whether a style of behavior itself is positive or negative than whether we can pin it to men or women."

Most people will never view gender the same way which is why most very far right Christians feel most comfortable with their very restrictive labels on what gender is.

This is why societal gender is just so problematic. It's great that you view gender as core to yourself. I don't view it as core to me, but that does not mean I don't think I have one or that I believe having a personal definition of gender is bad.

The denial that people have them deep inside, and rejecting people as being the gender they are when they do express it, are my issues with how it's sometimes framed.

But that genderless society would still have transition, in the sense that some people (not all modern-definition trans folk) will still require puberty blockers and hormone therapy to thrive as an unavoidable consequence of how we're born (but maybe in such a world trans might only refer to physical transition like that)."

There are people who, historically And modernly, move between genders. There are other modern cultures that do gender differently than the dominant Western (American) model. 

“We just won’t recognize gender anymore” is a model that could theoretically be done. IMO, it’s sort of a modern take on the pre-modern European model where there was only one sex/gender (male).

We do see differences in male and female babies from incredibly young ages, so we know that there's at least little nature in there. And research on trans and intersex patients certainly suggest that there's some clear psychological difference in there that is innate.

But it also doesn't really matter. Because just because something is the result of one's environment doesn't make it any less real. Like, some current hypotheses about the causes homosexuality suggest that it may be a result of both nature and nurture to some degree, but does that mean that the role that nurture might play can be reversed and we can ""straighten"" people out? So far, the answer seems to be no. 

Gendered differences are likely the same way, since literally every society that we have any data on has shown differences in traits associated with men and women.

To me I do not see value in the abolishment of gender IDENTITY, however I do believe that if a society progresses to gender equity (while also growing inclusion, rights, and ability to experiment for people who are questioning gender or have a non-binary gender, non conformist expression, so on and so forth) we can reduce the imbalances of power that require there to be an immediate classification of each person as man or woman for social context and placement in the worldview. Gender identity is extremely important to some. If everyone around me suddenly stopped using gendered language, that doesn’t mean we’d all be equal. There would just no longer be a referential check for me to understand how someone is placing me in their worldview. Men and women and non-binary people would all still exist because gender is, at least at this point of humanity, something that exists inside our personal view of self. Removing social references to gender doesn’t make us equal, it just obscures whether we’re being seen as the person we wish to be seen as.

However, if it’s not transgressive to act in whatever ways suit the individual, if gender no longer limits forms of advancement and people aren’t pushed into certain paths over others primarily because of how they appear to fit the gender category, then maybe naturally over time gender becomes less important and that would be ok. But for those of us in the here and now, especially those who are fighting to be seen and respected as who they actually are, gender is still very important and one person’s gender less utopia is nearly dehumanizing to another, even if both in question are trans."

I am a gay woman, yet because of my presentation I can sometimes be viewed as male. Corrective rape is part of why I refuse to travel to some very homophobic countries. 

The idea of gender being something that matters to society, to other people, in the way I present is actively harmful. This isn't on you or on anyone alive today that is queer. 

This is to say that society has created an actively harmful binary that in which if you don't present as strictly male or female in certain places, you will be raped and harassed. That is a fact. It happens every day.

I'm not going to apologize for being tired of gender mattering and I'm not going to apologize for the multitude of sexual harassment I've faced for being a woman who doesn't look ""traditionally"" female in countries and states that are super restrictive as to what gender is. 

I think you need to work on separating what I defined as societal gender vs personal gender because I view these things as two seperate notions. Societal gender is harmful and no one should have the power to define your gender or mine."

Telling a new friend ""I'm gay"" certainly may not inform them of exactly what type of men I'm after, but it does give a rough idea and it takes 3 seconds to say.

Giving people granular examples until they extrapolate what you're into sounds like training machine learning algorithms to recognize fire hydrants for Captcha.

I know several people who are against big labels, but honestly I don't understand it. As long as you're allowed to deviate from them wherever necessary, they're awfully useful. Saying ""I'm a cis het woman"" conveys a ton of information in 3 words, and nobody's stopping you from specifying ""I'm rather butch and I'm into nurturing guys"" or even giving granular examples, if you want to go into specifics.

Also, you said this:

>dating apps are smart enough to match us based on a whole slew of parameters

If dating apps can recognize patterns in individuals that we like (or in general) and categorize them based on that, it would make an awful lot of sense to just give names to those categories and just use them to communicate, and I'm afraid people would just do exactly that organically over time, basically just creating a new set of defined labels that the AI decided was most efficient for categorization, instead of our current ones.

Personally I'm all for that, I'd be pretty excited to have an AI optimize the way we talk about ourselves and give us the most efficient categories to describe exactly the type of person we want to talk about in the least number of words, but I suspect this isn't what you wanted at all. :p"

ADHD, for example. It's a word that describes a specific thing. If you feel like it describes your own truth well enough, like you said, you use it, like you did, and hopefully having a word for it can help you learn more about that part of yourself. However, I can't just identify with having ADHD by choosing to interpret it as ""someone who swims very fast"", for example. It's not a definition that's meant to include everyone, and that's fine.

As you said, we ""choose"" our labels by investigating and discovering them. In some cases we can even change ourselves to fit different labels, or even fight to change who is included in some of them. But we can't just arbitrarily choose to identify with ones we don't fit under, simply because we like what that would say about us, just like I can't choose to identify with having ADHD, being black or being an exceptional swimmer."

Why?

If we are to accept trans people at their word, they should not have to do anything to prove their gender to you. In a perfect world that is. Why do I have to accept your axis and the definitions you prescribe to either end?

This is also largely along the lines of many of the conversations I've seen trans people have amongst themselves, in that gender really doesn't mean anything when you try to nail down a specific definition of what a man or woman is, but they would like society to accept them without experiencing the violence and hatred they face on a day to day basis for simply expressing who they are.

There is no real definition of man that does not exclude at least one person who identifies as a man. The only definition of man that is entirely inclusive is ""a person who calls themselves a man or feels that they are a man."" That is it and that should be enough. Because feelings are personal and how you feel has largely no bearing on my gender identity. How I feel about my gender has zero bearing on yours.

I am not the OP, but when I express that I am tired of gender I entirely mean that I wish gender meant nothing in society. Except what it means to you, personally, and those you desire to share it with. It shouldn't mean you assume other people are strong, tough, big, loving, caring, like pink, like dresses, etc... based on their gender, but you can take these things for yourself and define what they mean for you.

Does that make things complicated? Sure, but life is complicated and I think we can move towards accepting people for their personality first and the outward image they choose to present in an accepting environment and conversations we have with them  rather than making a split second decision based off of assumptions that we have based off of the words male and female and if they wear a skirt or a dress. We should more towards complications rather than simplicity."

It's not about destroying the sexes (but we shouldn't forget that not even that is as easy as just two truths). There's biological differences between men and women and that's important, especially medically. It's just the concept of  gender that's nonsensical of you really think about it."

I am a man. You would probably say that my self expression isn't very masculine. The point is that I determine whether or not I am a man, not you, or anyone else. When we gatekeep who and what a man is, we inevitably hurt anyone who falls outside of what our definition of what a man is, therefore, it is up to the individual to determine whether or not they are a man, and what that means to them.

It's when people start identifying as X when they do not fit into that box when problems arise - that's when peoples gender gets questioned because they aren't masculine or feminine. Personally I'm not a fan of labels at all, but I am only against harmful labels.

Think about vegans, the stereotype is that they tell everyone they are vegan. For the vast majority of people, it only comes up when its time to pick somewhere for dinner - ""I don't like cheese"" isn't an identity. There are many people whos identity is not tied directly to their gender or sexuality. To those kinds of people, it doesn't make sense to bring those topics up when they aren't pertinent. There is never a need for others to know what your sexuality or gender are, it's purely personal and there's no situation where you need to tell someone, so for those kinds of people it never comes up.

For those people, their gender or sexuality is not a meaningful part of their identity, so even if it would be efficient to use a label, it just doesn't matter. Does that perspective make sense? It's like cultures that exist in cold climates have more words relating to snow/ice (I'm paraphrasing a popular myth here in a hopefully more factual way) - ""Studies of the Sami languages of Norway, Sweden and Finland, conclude that the languages have anywhere from 180 snow- and ice-related words and as many as 300 different words for types of snow, tracks in snow, and conditions of the use of snow."" - that's great, but I don't need all those words, I've been to a dozen countries but never one with snow!"

5152,2020-10-01 00:33:00,j25na2,"I am not telling anyone they can or can't do anything, just want to be clear on that.

The fact is that femininity and masculinity are vague, ill-defined, and highly gendered. In the absence of gender we would struggle to encapsulate everyone into equivalent groups because the groups are purely constructed relative to gender: not all men are masculine, not all women are feminine.

Without gender any gender-dependent concepts can't exist either. Cis identity is essentially ""my gender aligns with my sex"" so without ""gender"" cis can't exist. 

I think a lot of people who define themselves relative to gender are concerned by that idea - ""if I can't be a man, what am I?"" - but again I want to be clear I am not telling anyone they can or can't do anything. From a pragmatic perspective, transitioning to a post-gender society is a multi-generational feat.

Just like it has taken multiple generations to wear down traditional-gender roles and traditional-sexuality attitudes, it will take multiple generations to switch from a gendered to non-gendered society."

I have not, and this is exactly my point. Every trans person I know, or I know *of*, has, as you said, seemed pretty consistent with their gender identity, some of them more so than a lot of cis people I know that sometimes get more ""experimental"".

If all these people you mentioned, who sincerely identify as men and as such seem at least *somewhat* consistent with that identity, do make up a spectrum of masculinity (however diverse) in the end, as you said, then why exactly do we need to stretch the definition of that gender any further than that?

Like you said, I've never met a person that sincerely identifies as a man, who took his gender expression to such an extreme that it felt that he was only adopting the word ""man"" and nothing else. And this is exactly why I say that masculinity doesn't need to realistically account for such a case, that would render it pointless, to be inclusive.

I've read that with trans people it is now thought that there is a small brain structure that's basic purpose is to ""map"" or ""scan"" the body and if the cartography of the body doesn't match the map that's contained there, body dysphoria may occur. That could give a physical basis for the disorder that's unrelated to gender performance or socialization."

""I am a man/masculine,"" is the only reference point for masculinity, in that case. It is the result of a particular internal makeup that results in this sensation. **Men are people who want to be seen as men,** regardless of what they look like or do.

What of transmen who don't pass, or who at first you mistake for a woman? Legitimate masculinity is there, but is not yet in full expression, perhaps.

Transgender discrimination means treating people who's gender does not necessarily align with their biological sex differently - for example treating trans people as if they are ill or just crossdressing. Discrimination based on sexuality is things like saying gay people are immoral or that straight people are boring. All these forms of discrimination exist because of gender roles, they are essentially society's way of kicking back at people who aren't conforming. A lot of people experience these kinds of discrimination on a daily basis, which causes huge harm to their well being. People are even assaulted, murdered, executed, etc based on these factors too, so it's definitely something that has real world impact.

That is the purpose gender has served and perhaps continues to do.

Whether the solution is to do away with gender alltogether, or try and formulate a more fluid spectrum of gender identities, I don't know. There is also a difference between trying to navigate gender as a person nowadays, in a world in which gender is very much real (because most people believe it is), as opposed to a hypothetical post-gender future."

5180,2020-09-30 15:08:11,j25na2,"None of the talking points given are ""because of the existence of gender."" 

&#x200B;

They are forms of gendered violence, yes, but that is because of social hierarchies, oppression, and a variety of other bad social issues. None of them are inherent to gender as it exists."
5181,2020-09-30 23:50:27,j25na2,"I do not see those as existing “because of gender.” I see them as existing “because of axes of oppression.”

“Girls are vapid” exists because of patriarchal misogyny that doesn’t value women’s work. “Boys are dumb” exists because toxic masculinity tells us that Real Men(r) are just blocks of muscle who think violence is the answer to everything. 

Discrimination against gay people isn’t “because gender exists” - gay people would not exist without gender btw. That discrimination comes from authoritarian desire to proscribe and control sexual action and desire. Gender can exist without homophobia - take a look at gay communities who align themselves by gender. 

The other commenter brought up corrective rape. I have experienced corrective rape. My gender exists regardless of whether anyone recognized it and it was about controlling my behavior - and he raped me for other non-gendered behaviors he did not approve of, so that, too, wasn’t “because genders exist.”"
5182,2020-10-01 00:19:20,j25na2,"I am sorry that you were raped, but it is definitely not my place to debate it or dissect it. I am absolutely not saying ""if gender didn't exist that would never happened to you"" or making any comment about what happened. 

&#x200B;

Do you think it's possible for ""patriarchy"", ""misogyny"", ""misandry"", ""women"", ""men"" or ""Real Men"" can exist without the concept of gender? If we can agree they won't exist, then the question seems to be whether similar levels of oppression will still exist.

I think you highlight the issues with tying your identity to gender, you say ""gay people would not exist without gender"" which is a powerful statement. For some people their entire existence is relative to gender. I don't think that is a good thing, sexuality labels are as constraining as gender roles.

I am not sure about your statements that gay communities have no homophobia. Firstly, I have yet to experience a gay community without homophobia. Secondly, I have definitely yet to experience a queer community without heterophobia. I am sure that there are some communities without any sexual discrimination, but I don't think there is any reliable way to determine which ones with broad strokes. As with anything, it seems like familiarity reduces discrimination, so the existence of gender-exclusive or sexuality-exclusive, let alone gender-and-sexuality-exclusive communities doesn't seem like an effective way to reduce hate."
5183,2020-10-01 00:24:26,j25na2,"The answer to bigotry, for me, isn’t “erase what they are using to base their hate off of.” Being “colorblind” doesn’t end racism but it does end your willingness to deal with it. 

I am all for ending forceful assignment of gender but we live in a gendered culture. Also- straight people would not exist without gender either. 

At some point, gender abolitionist need to grapple with the fact that in our culture sexual desire *is* heavily colored by gender. One of the reasons I consider myself a gay man is because I haven’t ever been attracted to someone who isn’t in the “male” box for gender. Removing those boxes will make finding a romantic or sexual partner. I consulted two close friends who are bi who both told me that gender informs their attraction even they are attracted to more than one gender."
5184,2020-10-01 00:38:47,j25na2,"We live in the culture we create for ourselves, nothing is set in stone, culture changes all the time.

I would question whether your friends and yourself are truly attracted to gender. Try opening https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/ and asking yourself if that person is attractive to you or not (refresh the page to see a new picture). All of the pictures on this site are AI generated, none are real people. None have gender.

Gender doesn't inform attraction, the presentation of a person and their biology does. I think that you have misattributed attraction to gender because it's easier, but gender is just a descriptive social construct, people still exist without it."
5185,2020-10-01 00:43:28,j25na2,"For me, gender 100% informs attraction. 

It might not for you! And that’s okay!

I have spent 20 years of my life sitting with and evaluating what my attraction is and how it works. As a gay trans man who struggled with attraction to gay men before I knew what trans was, this is something I seriously struggled with and had to master. 

I am specifically attracted to queer identified men. A guy saying he’s straight kills my attraction. A person saying they aren’t a man kills my attraction.  Trust me when I say I have tried and, as a demisexual, sexual attraction is way easier to kill than build. (My sexual attraction to someone can also be killed by bad politics so yes, social constructs are 100% part of my personal sexuality.)

Sexual attraction is a weird thing not under our control but it’s also not cool to tell someone they aren’t attracted to who they are attracted to."
5186,2020-10-01 00:48:03,j25na2,"Well, not to worry anyway. The transition to a post-gender society will be a slow one, so you have plenty of time to enjoy genders.

Thanks for the chat, have a good one!"

5231,2020-09-23 18:35:55,iydxv4,">Nick Cage was offered the Aragorn in LotR and Sean Connery was offered the role of Gandalf.

Wrong.

Sir Sean Connery was a studio notice from New Line: ""either go for Connery or you won't get greenlit."" Jackson wasn't vehemently against it, but he was on record as early as 1998 that ""Sean Connery will not be Gandalf."" I believe Jackson toyed with the (nice, but clearly impractical idea) of getting Sir Nigel Hawthorne before becoming dead-set on Sir Ian McKellen. I believe the studio next suggested Christopher Plummer.

Nicolas Cage's agent had ""dialogue"" with New Line for the role of BOROMIR, not Aragorn. The filmmakers declined, and negotiations never got past that. They were locked into Stuart Townsend from quite early on, and when they laid him off, they decided on Viggo Mortensen almost immediately."

Of course you need to be honest with the person you want to marry and ask that they be honest with you, because marriage is about finding someone who shares those values. The problems arise from an imbalance in power. Having a career is good: forbidding your wife from having a career is unfair. Being monogamous is fine: saying men are biologically predisposed to cheating and women should be loyal to their husbands no matter what is problematic. But yes, by all means, find a good job and someone who wants a monogamous marriage, bro."

I can speak for LGBT+ people in part though, since I'm a double dipper in that community. I've never seen anyone talk about monogamy being 'bad' or backwards. Poly people are usually the ones stressing the most that they feel the need to make sure their partners know about their sexuality and preference, since monogamy is the preferred/norm. Tbh I also want a monogamous relationship, I'm jealous as hell and want my SO to be my 'no. 1' romantically. Anything less will make me feel like scraps they just happened to think were good enough at the time no matter what they say to me.

5272,2020-10-30 13:04:30,jkuhgc,"On #1: it's a noble idea. You should, however, consider the effects your company is having on the environment and whether it is possible to change the corporate culture to match your progressive values. I doubt you would get very far up the corporate ladder if you tried to change a rampantly sexist work environment for example.

On #2: Marriage is consensual, so there's nothing wrong with it. There are extremists in every group, including progressives. There are fringe leftists who are magnified by people on the right, not the left, who might say any male interaction with a woman is oppression. Ignore those weirdos who might just be saying shit for the attention it brings them.

Progressivism moves society toward a more tolerant, peaceful, sustainable future. If those are your values, let them lead your decision making and you can still go very far in life."
5273,2020-10-30 14:01:39,jkuhgc,"Hey bro! I mainly have input for the first thing, so here we go. This is going to be long because you touched on a topic I'm passionate about, sorry if it comes across as rambling!

Wanting to be successful and have enough money to not worry about it isn't evil or horrible. Having a stable life is helpful to your mental health, the mental health of your close ones etc, and there are different ways of getting there. You would also need that in order to put your full focus in what matters: driving the change. If you try to do that while constantly worrying about rent and bills and insurance, you will burn yourself out and that doesn't help anyone.

Wanting to be successful doesn't equate that you want to squash other people down or exploit them, there are ways of succeeding while helping others and lifting them up as you go. 

As for corporate culture and your argument of rising to a position where you can change the system. Yes. There are different ways to induce change, and in my personal opinion we need to deploy more than one of them to be successful. Do companies listen to people protesting on the streets and writing online? If there are enough of us doing that, they will bend to an extent because it hurts their revenue and image. However, even for that the management needs to have someone there who can frame the change in a way that is acceptable, but it will most likely be limited to whatever makes people calm down at that very moment.

If we want full on change (again in my personal opinion) we have to do it from the inside of the system to ensure that its done fully and properly (in cases where the system still functions, at least somewhat. This is a very general statement so please take it with a grain of salt in that regard).

We have to vote in elections to make sure the governments consist of people who will change things for better. If there are no such candidates, then we might have to step up ourselves and become the candidates we want to see. This is part of the democratic process.

We have to become the members of the boards of the corporations making these decisions, framing things in a way that makes change make sense. If you shout at a person it makes them defensive and resistant to change. If enough people shout at person, they will probably change to get the shouting to stop - but no more, the resistance is still in there. But if you are in a position where you can make the change make sense to that person, there will be a proper change.

The real danger in embarking to that is losing your sight on the way. Every university major, every workplace, they are their own bubbles with their own perspectives, issues, needs and demands.

Same with politics (I'm from Europe so I can only speak from my perspective, but I think the ""us vs them"" is even stronger in USA), people get so wrapped in their own arguments that they stop listening to the other side, and change isn't made because one side is forcing the other, and that loops back to the shouting example: the other side will resist. More and more people seem to lose their ability to disagree civilly, but change isn't a zero-sum game and we have to accept that others will have differing opinions, needs and wishes.

Also an interesting take on changing the system from within and the corruption of power is the book series on Baru Cormorant by Seth Dickinson.

So tl;dr : no, your wishes are not evil. They are reasonable, and you're right: you need stability and power to enact real, lasting change. But beware losing the sight of the bigger picture."
5274,2020-10-30 13:52:12,jkuhgc,"Look I've kinda been where you were, and most of it is probably insecurity.  There are some people on the left who will say marriage is bad but the reasons are more like ""This Burger has historically been undercooked"" than ""This Burger recipe is shit"".

The reality is no one will care.  You'll get an asshole or two who will scream some shit about not being a ""real leftist"" but most of your insecurities are probably just you worried about being moral yourself.  

I'm currently dealing with this.  I generally go into leftist spaces and am not exactly the target demographic.  I'm just latino, I dont have any other traits that stigmatize me like being a gender or sexual minority nor am I a woman.  Latino issues arent really covered as much as black issues and even then I'm middle class.  I felt like my priveledge and desires for what I want out of life made made me a bad person or that if I didnt go all in on being lefty I was a bad person.  Truth is that that isnt true. 

Systems are the enemy not people.  Systems keep women oppressed, lgbtq+ people in the closet and put racial minorities in prison or kill them.  You cant blame someone for wanting to do what's best for them.  That's what everyone usually does.  You want a career to make yourself financially secure and maybe help people.  You want a wife because you want that companionship.  None of these are wrong. My theory is that because we've been taught these things are the norm and alot of the norm is wrong we take a cursory glance and say these things are wrong rather than look at what makes things wrong.  Kinda like when people say something in media is problematic and your first instinct is to throw the baby out with the bath water.

So in summation, dont worry about it.  Maybe spend some time off of twitter but that's it.  You're thinking because you want something stereotypical, it's wrong but you're fine.  

Your #1 is just you trying to make the best of capitalism.  Your #2 is you making the best of life.  You arent a bad person for wanting a job because everyone needs money.  You arent a bad person for wanting a wife because everyone needs companionship in a form they like. The issue is everyone needs money or they die and old style marriage kept women oppressed as much of it was transactional between men plus social stigma for divorce/defending yourself ect.   Just dont be dick and you'll be fine."

I got married 2 years ago (our anniversary was like 2 days ago, woop woop) to a really excellent dude who calls himself a feminist, and he's been nothing but supportive of me and my experiences. I don't think he's ever really been chauvinistic, and I adore the way he really tries to be mindful of his privilege as a white cis dude. I kept my last name, but I intend on changing it here soon, and not to his. There's just a lot of baggage attached to my family names on both sides, and I don't want to take his for FeMiNiSt reasons, so I'm just making up my own lol. All that being said, I don't think monogamy is AT ALL problematic! It's more problematic to assume polyamory or monogamy is the only option imo! I'm a jealous fuck at times, and I try to temper it. I know I wouldn't be able to sustain a poly relationship. 

Jobwise, you gotta do what you want to do. Corporate jobs can be great. I work in a very small business that's probably more problematic than some bigger corporations. Like, we sell some of our stuff to private jails so they can resell them for a 500% markup to underpaid prisoners. It makes my blood boil. Anyways, what I'm saying is that for progressives, NOTHING will be good enough because nearly all types of work in a capitalist culture are, by nature, exploitative.

It is a completely fair argument to say you want to be monogamous, it's very natural. It is ridiculous for someone to call that want to be equal partners with one person misogynistic, another example of people telling men how their feelings are wrong.  


I'm progressive myself, but too many people in our ideology believe in not making money and being poor as part of their personality. You don't have to buy stock in Wells Fargo to save and work hard at your position, live frugally, save money and then pay for solar panels, or invest in green energy. Whatever works!

5279,2020-10-30 15:14:40,jkuhgc,"I’m also part of similar spaces and I gotta say, while I dislike corporations, I do have respect for a career with an upward trajectory. One of my best friends used to be pretty high up in a big-name corporation and I respect his journey, although he has said many times that many people at the top were selfish and insufferable (he ended up quitting), which of course contributes more to my dislike of them. However, he is still involved in the corporate world as an executive coach and tries his best to encourage others with power to be more thoughtful and generous. It’s not the way I as a socialist would do things, but he’s doing what he can in the way he knows how and I think that’s very noble.

As for monogamy, I have never actually heard anyone bash it. Even the polyamorous people I know are cool with it, they just (understandably) don’t like us bashing their lifestyle either. I’m a monogamist myself and hope to get married someday and wear a nice white dress or white tux (depending on who I marry)."

Until there is an actual alternative to living within capitalism, we all have to do what we all have to do to survive.

2. I think your feelings are completely valid. It can be difficult wanting a monogamous relationship, nowadays. I think the culture surrounding relationships has largely shifted to being primarily focused on short-term, physically focused relationships with many partners versus a long-term, emotionally focused relationship with one person. I don't think people should be shamed for desiring the former but I also think it reflects the growing trend in society to try and commodify human intimacy.

5285,2020-10-30 14:57:24,jkuhgc,"I'm going to be adressing these points one by one. 

> **I want to have a career with an upward slope** 

For this point keep in mind that I'm an anticapitalist and would consider myself a radical leftist. I dont think you're wrong in wanting a career. By partaking in the capitalist system and being part of the consumption cycle you are already contributing to the exploitation of the global south. There is no ethical consumption under capitalism. That said, I get where you're coming from and ultimately, I dont think there is anything wrong with striving to live a fulfilled life in a broken system. Just dont become the next Jeff Bezos. 

However, regarding your point about ""changing the system from within"", thats what in the left is called ""reformism"" and while you can do some good that way, you cant change the system from within the system because the system - in this case capitalism - is inherently flawed. 

You should also consider that, while such a career might be tempting from the outside, it can also be highly stressful. Consider how much you actually need without it impacting your happiness significantly. A lot of people consume way more than they actually need to and buy a lot of shit that doesnt make them any happier long-term, while also working so much to drive that consumption that they are missing out on the things which would actually make them happy. r/simpleliving is a great ressource you could look into. Simple living doesnt mean frugal living, just recognizing what you actually need and what you can cut from your life without detriment.

Lastly I want to adress your point about there not being any alternative. I dont think thats the case. I wont peddle my personal ideology, but rather recommend that you educate yourself on different ways society can be run and might be run to the benefit of the many rather than the few. There's a lot of great reading material out there and there are a lot of ways you can do your part in making the world a better place.

&#x200B;

> **I want a monogamous relationship** 

Not an issue in itself. Historically, marriage has been used as a tool to opress women, but it doesnt have to. The reason for that is, that women didnt actually own that much, they didnt have a career and didnt earn any money. For that reason, it was very difficult for women to leave their marriage, because they wouldnt have anything to fall back on, unless they had relatives maybe. When you go into marriage planning, keep that issue in mind and find some way to circumvent it. The most obvious (and, in current economic conditions probably only reasonable) approach is for you both to work/have a career, so your partner can fall back on their own savings if they see the need to separate. If one of you wants to stay at home, things get a lot more complicated, but a solution with separate bank accounts where you share the income of the working partner could for example work as an (imperfect) solution.

You aren’t saying other people cannot enjoy their lives without monogamy, just that relationship doesn’t work for you.

Heck I think we can all agree what would help everyone is having a legal system inhabited by folk with a concience like yourself is beneficial to everyone.

Remember you dont owe a company anything and make sure you maintain a work life balance that will support your emotional and mental needs. Being able to comfortably support your loved ones is a wonderful thing, and while certain industries certainly are just awful, everyone needs to make money so I'd say just try and make positive changes in other places in your life.

2. There's nothing wrong with wanting monogamy as long as you are with someone who wants the same thing. Its all about consent communication and mutual respect. Just dont try force your lifestyle and values on people who don't want them/share them and you'll be fine. I've recently come out as polyamorous, but I think informed monogamy is still a wonderful thing and as I'm finding out polyamory is really hard and definitely not for everyone.

Hopefully that helps a bit. It sounds like you're a good kind hearted person so just stay aware of your self and you are much less likly to fall into any misogynist thought patterns."

On your second point, I don't think there's anything wrong about wanting to get married. I believe most people do at some point.

That’s all we can hope for most of the time.  Lawyers can do a lot of good in the world, depending on which side they’re on and depending on whom they choose to work for. 

WRT monogamy, and supporting LGBTQ+, you don’t have control over the type of genetalia that you like to do things with in bed. We do different things with different genetalia, and not all of us like to do all of those things. That’s ok. That’s what the gay community fought for over the last 40 years.

5294,2020-10-30 20:57:35,jkuhgc,"Hey bro,Although we don't share some opinions, here's some ""answers"" if you will.

1 - Yes, being in a position of power and especially in a position where you can ""put in your input"" can contribute to changing the way things are done.Hence, it is indeed a valid argument.

2 - I'd say that having a monogamous relationship (bonding) whether with friends or SOs, stems from a need to be able to trust and rely on people for survival (2000BC or 2020 AD doesn't matter). Concerning bonding with a SO is a bit more advanced since it also concerns survival in the long term (reproduction) and you may feel the need to be sure that your kid is yours.Going back to marriage and oppression, I fail to see how ""oppressing"" can it be for women to achieve what most of them dream of.If you actually ask women, very few are against marriage. Also, isn't trying endlessly (>40 years in media, universities...) to convince them not to do something the actual definition of oppression ?

Edit : And btw, dude, do what your gut tells you to. Wanna have a LTR ? do it. You want to have money and possibly change things ""from the inside"" ? do it.

5307,2020-10-30 19:21:51,jkuhgc,"I have very flexible physical standards. I am not a head turner myself. I am short (5'6) Indian. I just make sure I look after my health, and maintain good skincare routine. And that is all I expect from a woman when it comes to physical beauty. Just looking after yourself carefully can do wonders. However, we are born with some features and we can only improve so much. But character can be changing and evolving. And that is something we have control over. That's why I lay more emphasis on personality traits. Definitely some physical traits are attractive, but knowing someone makes them 100x attractive. It happened to me in the past where I wasn't really attracted to the girl in starting, but had a strong crush on her after getting to know her."

5309,2020-10-31 04:18:52,jkuhgc,"I actually live in Canada, doing my undergrad. So I am not really matching any western standards of male beauty. But I wrapped my head around it. It is not my problem whether someone finds me attractive or not. My focus are just the ones who do."

Was I a good bot? | [info](https://www.reddit.com/user/Reddit-Book-Bot/) | [More Books](https://old.reddit.com/user/Reddit-Book-Bot/comments/i15x1d/full_list_of_books_and_commands/)"
5352,2020-10-27 13:20:09,jix4ys,Focus on yourself in your sexuality. Close your eyes and be with yourself. You still need sexuality but maybe how you choose to embark in it should be inward focused.
5353,2020-10-27 17:09:27,jix4ys,Yes.
5354,2020-10-27 03:12:23,jipxfw,Eat at a calorie maintenance and incorporate a lot of protein into your diet. Also try lifting relatively heavy I like to lift we’re 8 reps is a struggle and if I can get ten rep then I bump up the weight. Also try to work each muscle two times a week.
5355,2020-10-27 03:26:29,jipxfw,"Hey I’m 2 months into working out and trying to bulk I’m 6ft and started off at 150 now I’m 160 I can send you a workout routine it’s 5$ a month but what I do is I workout 6 days a week and eat around 2600-3k calories a day here’s the link https://gobodyevo.com 
If you decide to use the program when it says to do high reps just shoot for 7-9 at least that’s what I do"
5356,2020-10-27 19:35:02,jipxfw,"It'll probably come down to which is more important to you- retaining a low body fat percentage the whole time, or reaching your desired amount of muscle mass faster. 

If you'd like to retain your low body fat percentage, then staying close to maintenance calories is probably best. You can also try eating in a surplus on days you lift and staying at maintenance on your off days.

If you'd prefer to add muscle more quickly, you could try a bulk, followed by a cut. Eat in a caloric surplus (with lots of protein) for a period of time and really emphasis muscle hypertrophy in your workouts. Then, cut your calories down to shed the fat that you'll gain during the bulk. Be sure to keep lifting during this period of time and continue to eat adequate protein. This will help to reduce the amount of muscle you lose during this time."
5357,2020-10-29 17:17:22,jipxfw,"The normal recommendation for people like you is to commit to a full body weightlifting routine 3x per week for at least six months (and then for the rest of your life).  A full body workout stresses every muscle group in a single workout, and usually looks something like this:

M:  squats, benchpress, deadlift, toe raises, rows, overhead press

T: rest

W:  bulgarian squat, chest flys, toe raises, clean and snatch, chin ups, sit ups

Th: rest

F:  lunges, curls, pushups, rows, deadlift, overhead press

Sa: rest

Sun: cardio

The goal is to work every set to exhaustion or near failure, which is usually around 3 sets of 10  for each exercise when you start out.  On rest days you will be a little sore.  On workout days you should be ready to lift again without hurting yourself.  Each muscle group should get hit at least two times per week, with a total weekly volume of 10-20 sets per week, but not more than 5 sets per day.

After the first six months you can switch to a different workout split, like upper body lower body, and increase your total volume by switching to four days per week (for example upper body on Mondays and Thursdays, lower body on Tuesdays and Fridays, rest on Weds and the weekend).  Rest and recover when you have injuries, and you will have injuries.

Most beginning lifters don't eat enough protein.  At your size, 135g of protein per day is a reasonable target at first.  Be sure to eat in a slight caloric surplus every day.  Weigh yourself every morning before breakfast and chart your progress, expecting to gain no more than 2 pounds per month.  

A big portion of that two pounds per month will be body fat, so at some point you switch to a cutting phase.  For example, you could work out for 6 months as described above, and if you're perfectly consistent with your workouts and and your diet (adding no more than 12 total pounds in six months), your body will add mostly muscle and some fat.  The ratio depends on your age and hormone levels, but SOME of that 12 pounds will be fat, at which point you start restricting your calorie intake with a goal of lowering total body weight by 0.5 to 1% per week.  If you've increased from 135 to 147 after six months, 1% of your bw is about 1.5 pounds per week so that's the maximum amount of weight you want to lose in a given week to avoid deconstructing too much of your new muscle mass.  So if you diet for a month, you can lose \~six pounds and get back to 141 pounds, having added six pounds of good muscle.  Keep lifting while you diet.

Then you go back on the bulking phase, trying to gain 1 to 2 pounds per month of total body weight.  Rinse and repeat, slowly adding muscle (and fat) and then dieting away the fat (and some of the muscle).  Some people diet one week per month, some people diet three months per year.  Do what works for you.  Being both muscular and lean requires constant cycling between eating in a surplus to add muscle and eating in a deficit to cut fat.  It takes *years* to build the kind of physique you're talking about.

And just so your expectations are reasonable, in the absence of exogenous hormonal support (aka steroids) you can reasonably expect to add about one pound of muscle mass per month of perfect training (and perfect diet, perfect sleep, etc).  Websites that claim to add a pound per week are lying to you to sell you a product.  The highest clinically recorded non-steroidal muscle gain in a single calendar year is only 18.25 pounds, and that guy was more genetically gifted than you or me.

In the long run, your rate of muscle mass growth will slow year after year.  Year two is slower than year one, year three is slower than year two, and by year four you're really only adding like two or three pounds of muscle per year.  After five years of consistent training you will have just about reached your body's genetic limit, and further training may make you stronger, but it won't make you any bigger.  For most people of average height, that genetic limit is something like 30-40 pounds of muscle.  That means your goal of 180 pounds might be out of reach unless you're willing to futz about with your body's hormone chemistry (Ronaldo is taller than you at 180, and Crews is a Hollywood actor who is free to use chemical enhancement)."

5362,2020-10-23 04:05:15,jgfis2,"From my experience, it's easier to abstain from PMO when you have a strong structure in your life. A structure is composed of your habits, goals, passions, things to look forward to in life and basically anything to replace the addiction. When the urges arise, you would have somewhere or something to transfer that energy to. Then PMO becomes insignificant. Remember that NoFap isn't a a finish line to be crossed, it is a lifestyle to be lived. I wish you both the best!

Take cold showers, excersie and meditate.
Don't stay alone at night (temptations rise drastically therefore there is a higher chance of fappin) 
Brain will continue to play games 
Increase in cravings is an indicator of healing.

3. HARD! You must keep yourself distracted or otherwise you will end up thinking about it and relapsing.
4. Jogging and taking cold showers. Also talking to people to keep myself from isolating and then fapping.
5. Nope.
6. Give him all the love you can to support him!"
5367,2020-10-23 15:01:19,jgfis2,"I think it's unrealistic for you to follow him around. I think the best thing he can do is just leave his phone with you and take a book to the washroom instead. 

The best preventative medicine for me is just having frequent sexual activities with my s/o outside of porn and masturbation. If I know there is a possibility of her initiating it helps to keep me from masturbating when she's not around. It also helps me to initiate knowing that she's down to play around. 

Some important things for him to do are to eliminate any triggers where possible. Instagram is a really common one, honestly reddit is too, but I find this community pretty helpful.

If he's open to the idea, task that man! Give him shit to do if you aren't home and that might help give him direction with his free time. Only if he's open to it though, otherwise it'll just come off as nagging.

Hobbies are helpful, too. Do things together outside of Netflix. Someone mentioned jogging. Exercise of any kind together, even just a walk can help. Board games, social activities, that kind of thing. It's a lot harder because of the pandemic.

Goals! Goals and rewards for success are great motivators. If I go X days I treat myself to Y. Help him figure out what he really wants and set realistic goal markers. 

The most important thing is don't take his relapses/""failures"" personally. He's going to relapse, if he doesn't he's some kind of god. I put failures in quotation marks because if he uses porn less today than he did last week, he's showing progress and it's something to be proud of.

I read in another comment that the two of you marked hentai as ok. If you read nothing else today, read this. To quit this addiction it is not ok. One of the things about porn addiction is that you end up chasing a high of new content, hentai being even more unrealistic can also be even more damaging. I don't know how much you know about it, but this addiction can cause a lot of social anxiety and sexual frustration, like erectile dysfunction or difficulty achieving orgasm with a sexual partner. No porn is ok. No porn is safe. Just like for alcoholics, nothing alcoholic is safe to consume."
5368,2020-10-23 03:59:16,jgfis2,And don't you think that watching porn in a relationship is equivalent to cheating ? If I were a girl I would consider watching porn cheating .... I mean are you okay with your guy watching some other girls naked and fapping to her  ???

5370,2020-10-23 04:06:42,jgfis2,"I'm sorry but you are not here in my relationship and cheating to me may not be what cheating to you is, and I respect that. 

Also, yes, he did feel bad about it and our solution to alleviate that guilt was that he can watch hentai (no cam girls, no real girls.) I do however want to note that every relationship is different. I ask you to keep your guilt trip to yourself, with all respect, what we consider cheating is not really any of your business."
5371,2020-10-23 13:17:49,jgfis2,"RE: hentai, some of that can be worse in that he will be rewiring to 2d images and this can affect sex with a partner. First thing I did was chuck hentai. There's also a risk of escalation because many genres can depict things physically impossible in real life (or that no human would want to act out for real) so I get the idea but feel it's worth warning that it's a risk.

With NoFap he shouldn't be watching any porn anyway because it keeps the addiction going, but do you mean hentai is what he's using as a temporary measure to slowly wean off porn altogether?"

On the same level as a ""TIL actor OJ Simpson played for the NFL before his illustrious acting career and eventual murder trial""."
5418,2020-10-22 01:43:05,jfpoym,So does Gina Linetti
5419,2020-10-24 00:42:38,jfpoym,"I think that's a little bit of an overexaggeration. OJ is a HOF player, and he is an athlete first, actor second. Terry Crews is an actor first, athlete second. His NFL career was pretty much mediocre. From what I gather, he wasn't anything spectacular. I dont think he ever went to the Pro Bowl. He will always be recognized for Everybody Hates Chris and his other acting ventures over anything he ever did in the NFL.

Basically, had OJ never murdered his wife or did any acting, he'd still be wide known by almost everybody as a Hall of Fame RB. Had Terry Crews never acted, he'd be known by virtually nobody. That's how little of an impact he ever had on the NFL. Unless you're some kind of NFL super-fan, I guarantee you that you knew Terry Crews as an actor before you ever figured out that he played in the NFL."

These woke libtards are the most racist people I have encountered in my life, they hate white people, they hate black people who don’t hate white people or who don’t consider themselves victims, it’s really gross to see."
5431,2020-10-21 23:29:05,jfnhqj,Chris Pratt is slated to be canceled for having the audacity to not appear in a Biden campaign ad as well as be Christian. Terry Crews voiced support for him and recieved a deluge of racist replies. I personally like RDJ take of telling people that are upset with Pratt to grow up and get off the internet and do soem self reflecting instead of hurtling abuse
5432,2020-10-21 23:25:40,jfnhqj,Not be in a Biden ad and also be Christian

5438,2020-10-22 00:28:39,jfnhqj,"That's actually what happened. Chris Pratt didn't appear at a Biden fundraising event with a bunch of other Marvel actors; this, combined with the fact that he's a publicly practicing Evangelical Christian, led to a bunch of people concluding he's a Trump supporter and trying to cancel him."
5439,2020-10-21 23:37:00,jfnhqj,That's literally what happened
5440,2020-10-22 14:42:38,jfnhqj,Even if he was a Trump supporter it wouldn’t matter. Those are his beliefs and people need to respect that other people have different views than him.

5450,2020-10-21 14:44:19,jfd5iu,oh no terry crews
5451,2020-10-24 16:42:41,jfd5iu,Terry Crew is the best !
5452,2020-10-21 15:14:46,jfd5iu,Who was the last person Crews tried to defend on Twitter that just told him they were better off without his support?
5453,2020-10-22 01:05:51,jfd5iu,The modern society thought police are out in full force.  I'm equally terrified of both the right and left extremes... why is it so hard for people to walk in a  common sense middle ground?
5454,2020-10-22 01:09:08,jfd5iu,I don’t give a shit if he was “homeless” that’s  irrelevant. Nice try tho!
5455,2020-10-22 05:06:21,jfd5iu,Brie is kind of on her own little bubble in the Marvelverse.
5456,2020-10-21 16:34:51,jfd5iu,"Maybe they were never friends with her, merely co-workers. Who knows"
5457,2020-10-21 15:26:53,jfd5iu,I wonder if it’s a behind the scenes thing. Some people have speculated that politics and personal views aside they other marvel people just don’t fuck with Brie Larson as a friend but Chris Pratt seems to always be loved by his co-stars and people around him
5458,2020-10-22 15:19:22,jfd5iu,"One point of difference between the two situations is that Brie Larson has been very outspoken and critical of issues relating to representation and sexism in the industry. She's drawn attention to those things, and thus it's going to piss off the trolls and incel fanboys. 

Chris Pratt literally had nothing to do with this, yet ended up trending on Twitter being ""cancelled"" because people don't like his private life. 


I'm not saying one is right; no one should take the abuse that the Twitter mob dishes out, but just suggesting one way the situations differ."
5459,2020-10-21 17:54:40,jfd5iu,Pretty sure she wasn’t well liked on set. People are saying Pratt has been a very kind individual and thus defend him.
5460,2020-10-21 16:31:39,jfd5iu,"This is odd to read. 

But no one has to defend anyone. Maybe they don't like Larson for some reason."
5461,2020-10-21 18:11:54,jfd5iu,Ikr I’ve never heard these people speak up on social injustices people in this country are facing but actor gets his ego hurt from online poll and suddenly the “avengers” are here to avenge.
5462,2020-10-21 18:00:23,jfd5iu,"He’s been getting harassed about being Christian for a while, now he’s being harassed because he hasn’t shown any outward support of Biden. This little “poll” popped up and he was voted out for these reasons, but he’s been getting harassed for a while."
5463,2020-10-21 17:55:33,jfd5iu,"I think it’s more the fact that people used the poll to dogpile the man. I’ve seen a bunch of labels slapped on him, without any proof to back them up"
5464,2020-10-21 19:17:03,jfd5iu,Just like Reddit.
5465,2020-10-22 01:55:29,jfd5iu,Because common sense and religion are mutually exclusive
5466,2020-10-21 22:18:26,jfd5iu,Yeah but they don't exactly seem to be besties with Chris either.
5467,2020-10-22 09:11:14,jfd5iu,"Don Cheadle, Samuel Jackson, Chadwick Boseman and Anthony Mackie stood up for her though"
5468,2020-10-22 00:09:50,jfd5iu,Really? I've never heard that
5469,2020-10-21 21:05:22,jfd5iu,Every single person that has defended him has been outspoken on social media about the injustices people are facing.
5470,2020-10-22 08:39:22,jfd5iu,"He belongs to a notoriously homophobic church community that also has ties to sexual abuse and financial fraud. You can argue that this is any religion of course, but I would say there is a difference in being raised in ethnically/culturally associated religions that have existed for millennia (ie. being Jewish or Catholic or Muslim, etc) and are bigger the system that “regulates” them (ie. being culturally catholic and disavowing the clergy after the sex abuse scandals or being ethnically or culturally Jewish and opposing the conflict in Israel) and then being in a very modern sketchy celebrity super church that funnels money into gay conversion camps or works to defund Planned Parenthood with that celebrity money. 

He also has some issues with animals/pets, he is into guns (always polarizing and generally conservative leaning,) and there were rumors he cheated on his ex-wife. These things will eat away at your reputation bit by bit.

Many celebrities are using their platforms to speak out against injustice and then you have a celebrity who stays mum, gives money to an organization that promotes hate, and has politics that suggest that he might have some less than savory opinions on BIPOC, the second amendment, anti-choice, etc. Then his celeb friends, who purportedly support gun control, the LGBTQIA+ community, BLM, feminism, etc. come put swinging to defend him just because he’s their celebrity buddy. And they did nothing for their female costar who got considerable flack for basically being a woman with ideals.

Soooooo yeah, it makes sense people are disappointed with Ruffalo and RDJ and whomever."
5471,2020-10-21 18:14:05,jfd5iu,"LOL no one is harassing him, talking shit maybe, but guess what other people in this country get talked shit about because of their sexuality have you ever heard what people on the internet say about gay people? Spoiler it’s much worse than anything people have said about Chris Pratt but yet you and these celebs are silent about that it’s really telling."
5472,2020-10-22 00:42:20,jfd5iu,Won’t somebody please think about the conservative millionaire. He’s getting dogpiled on social media.  Oh my!
5473,2020-10-22 10:16:22,jfd5iu,"funnily enough, that is literally what the bible says... ""For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God."" - 1 Corinthians 1:18"
5474,2020-10-23 02:32:51,jfd5iu,"That's because it's not true. It's become a talking point with those type of rejects who (still!) obsessively make YouTube videos about how Brie Larson is a bitch, and it's based on literally no evidence."
5475,2020-10-22 01:06:25,jfd5iu,"Except they really haven’t, especially not Terry Crews, Zoe Salanda or Robert Downey Jr."
5476,2020-10-23 16:11:12,jfd5iu,"The same people criticizing his church would never critique Islam which is predominantly a lot more homophobic than Christianity nowadays.

I'm not religious but I think Christianity is an easier target because if you criticize it, you **don't get your head cut off.**"
5477,2020-10-22 09:07:40,jfd5iu,"Haha I love how “into guns” is one of the points as if it’s any of your business that he likes guns, as if him liking them hurts anybody else. Take the nonsense elsewhere."
5478,2020-10-21 18:31:19,jfd5iu,">Spoiler it’s much worse

Yea sorry but its 2020 now, if you want to be a A list actor but associate strongly with a church that hates gays, i dont know what you're expecting and what you think it may say or not say about you.  Your career is build on three mega franchises that are about audiences coming to see you but you associate with a religion that is about blocking people away.  Maybe its the wrong line of work"
5479,2020-10-21 21:28:42,jfd5iu,">low IQ whataboutism

Every time."
5480,2020-10-21 18:48:53,jfd5iu,"I find it funny the insane amount of assumptions you just laid out. Your immaturity is both adorable and sad.

Holy shit I just looked at your comment history you literally bring up gay people in every comment lol"
5481,2020-10-22 01:03:39,jfd5iu,"Oh dear, people who have actually met this conservative millionaire (who used to be homeless, and live off the leftover food from the tables he waited) are saying he’s a good guy. This can’t be happening!"
5482,2020-10-23 17:19:23,jfd5iu,"Or maybe because people who practice Islam in the US aren’t necessarily homophobic because they’re combining modern sentiments with their cultural religion and they have left behind the countries that discriminate and criminalize homosexuality. And then those people also experience Islamophobia and racism? 

And secondly, You’re not going to get your head cut off for criticizing Islam in the US.

Also, you don’t seem understand that Christianity and Hillsong church are not the necessarily the same thing. I’m a Christian-I am Catholic. I know other Christians, who are Lutheran, Baptist, etc. 

Pratt isn’t just a Christian. He attends and supports a wealthy *business* that contributes to conversion camps, homophobia, and other nasty business. They happen to call themselves Christians. People are not upset with Pratt being religious. They are upset with the particular group he associates with. Notice that Kanye West does not get as much shit for being religious. People took issue with him publicly melting down and talking about aborting his daughter on IG and his anti-choice stance and how that affected his wife and maybe his kids. But his religious music and his wanting to build his own Church-people don’t have a problem with *that* particular area per se."
5483,2020-10-22 12:36:15,jfd5iu,"I’m just listing one of several reasons why Pratt is not liked, and that definitely is one of them. 
“Into guns” or however else we can phrase it is controversial, especially I imagine, around Hollywood, where most people are likely pro gun control. We are growing up in a society that is heavily debating gun ownership. So why is pointing out that he is a gun owner and that it’s potentially controversial “nonsense”? 

Even if I was someone who was totally pro 2nd amendment, I would point this out. Most of the people who dislike Pratt are those who disagree with his right-leaning politics."

2) Those aren’t assumptions they’re facts these people don’t speak up about more serious issues of harassment and bullying facing marginalized people

3) I speak about gay issues a lot because this platform allows me to connect with other gay people, because unlike you I have a life in the real world and speak on everything else there, unlike you, you antisocial loser

5512,2020-10-19 13:17:08,je0sem,"When you build for overall strength and fitness, you have to eat a lot of calories. Building a layer of fat over your muscles helps protect them from injury, helps your endurance, makes sure you get enough nutrients to be in peak physical health. 

When you ""shred/get ripped"", you do all the strength training in the previous example, and then when you need to get photos taken/drop weight to make a weightclass/etc, you basically go on such a harsh diet that you're eating maybe a few hundred calories a day. You starve yourself for a couple of weeks, drop all that extra weight from water/fat/a little muscle, and you look magnificent for your photo/movie/fight. But you're a lot weaker than you were two weeks prior when you were eating right. 

You'll notice that people who participate in Strongman competitions look fat, especially compared to the aesthetic competitions like bodybuilding. Strongmen sit around 20-22% body fat, which is way higher than the average male. Bodybuilders can drop down to as close to 2% as they can get."

Essas coisas.

Acho que seu psicólogo tem razão quando o Terry Crew vende essa ideia de ficar sem se masturbar completamente, muito associada a culpa cristã ou vício. Talvez seja razoável você não parar completamente e ficar alguma dias sem, depois se masturbar, etc.

We don't have great data going back to 1860 but we do have it going back to 1913.

In 1913 the average person worked 60-70 hours a week for a 2020 inflation adjusted wage of 7 dollars an hour. 60-70 hours a week of back breaking labor in horrible dangerous conditions.

People were being terribly exploited. Marx had a point at the time.

Marx would never in a million years have predicted that after 150 years of more capitalism that people would be working from home or working in an office that basically pampers you. Min wage working 15 hours a week at the mall would be more than the average wage at his time for 70 hours a week in a sweatshop.

This was not the prediction at all. He would admit he was completely wrong. If you disagree you are completely missing how empirical Marx was and how he came to the conclusions he came to at the time.

Modern day Marxism is just a type of religion. Has nothing to do with economics or reality. It is a religion with a bearded savior just like many other religions. Savior with the holy text that shows how to find salvation and heaven on Earth. I am not religious but at least most religious people realize they are practicing a religion and not economics.

> I answered your second question with an estimation. You asked what percentage of the world, and I said first world countries.

Well, clearly not everyone in the first world (which is defined as... ?) has a job like he describes. And he never said anything to suggest he was talking exclusively about certain countries."
5571,2020-12-14 03:13:30,kclxqn,"1. I did not say nor act like its a definition of marxism. In fact, no where did anyone attempt to claim thats a definition, its not even phrased as a definition. I claimed that the way you asked what do you think marxism means sounded rhetorical, sarcastic, and passive aggressive, and I used the quote to show how it came across, which in no way sounds like a definition, or even comes across as a claim at a definition.

2. He never claimed ALL people, or everyone in the first world, have jobs like that, but rather that marx never thought they would be as widespread relative to marx’s time. Furthermore he referred specifically to capitalist countries with minimum wage jobs working 15 hours a week at the mall. While there are outliers to that, it is very much implied he is referring to first world countries, considering that the first rule of being a *first world country* is to have a capitalist economy. It’s common sense."
5572,2020-12-14 16:18:31,kclxqn,"1. Exactly, so you agree you didn't answer my question.

2. Marx mostly stayed away from predicting the future and I'll stay agnostic what he thought would happen 150 years in the future. The category of ""first world country"" used to be defined as capitalist, ""second world country"" USSR/China+ affiliated countries and ""third world country"" unaffiliated. I don't think that he meant what you say, but it matters little, regardless, isn't my question much more relevant?"
5573,2020-12-14 16:28:38,kclxqn,"1. Yes, I agree that I did not answer your question, because the nature and phrasing of the question came across as condescending and rhetorical, instead of a genuine question. That may not have been your intent however.

2. I believe he meant exactly what I said. Why else would he have used such specific examples that are not found in other “nth-world countries”? The specific example of 15 hour work week on minimum wage in the mall/working in an office that pampers you is very specific and unique to first world countries. There may be outliers, sure, but their examples lead to one type of economy. If they had talked about other forms of labor/working conditions, I would be inclined to agree that “who knows what type of peoples/countries are they talking about, and how many of those in the world?” but the nature of their example leads to capitalist first world countries. Just because they didnt give the exact definition and nature of what they are speaking doesnt mean you have to act cluelessly. There is such a thing as common sense and implication, which you might seem to be missing here."
5574,2020-12-14 21:52:02,kclxqn,"I live in a mostly capitalist country which functions very well for most of its inhabitants, but take our food, our clothes, our electronics as an example, they are mostly not manufactured in this country anymore. If you just look at this country you will get a quite incomplete picture of the economy. Capitalism is global, you can pick countries it works well for or other where it doesn't. But if you choose to only look at the one or the other your picture is incomplete and necessarily wrong.

I do not agree that is is reasonable to focus just on the countries where it works well, if we only look at some countries and not others, why not look at the countries where most people live? 

Or what about climate-change, that this system (which according to some people here even Marx would fully endorse, if only he could just see its current form) has produced? It is easier to imagine an end to the world than an end to capitalism, isn't it?

And so many things that improve the quality of life in these capitalist first world countries have been opposed by capitalists at every step and are socialist policies, often implemented by democratic means."

We know BLM doesn’t care about blacks dying when they attack police officers, because they keep blaming cops instead of calling for people to cooperate and stop resisting arrest.  

We know BLM isn’t concerned at all with all the violent deaths blacks suffer at the hands of one another.  

We know BLM doesn’t care about the epidemic of hundreds of black children being killed by violence every year in their own black community.  

We know BLM doesn’t give a shit about the systemic issues in black culture that are a barrier to their success.  

We know BLM doesn’t care about successful black businesspeople because they endorsed looting and destroyed many of their businesses.

That's not their role within the system, the idea that a movement that's sponsored by hundreds of corporations is communistic is silly.

> Demonstrating just how far left they are, another cofounder wrote an article on a Venezuelan news website in which she called out Bernie Sanders for calling Hugo Chavez a dictator.

Don't see an issue or how that makes anyone ""far.""

> Even worse, Susan Rosenburg sits on the Board of Directors of blm

Not really, it's Thousand Currents which is behind blm, which isn't the same.

> She is free now because her sentence was commuted by Bill clinton

And because Rudy Giuliani didn't prosecute her for terrorism.

> But Ms. Rosenberg denied any involvement in the Brink's robbery and was never tried on those charges, because Mr. Giuliani, then the United States attorney in Manhattan, indicated that given her 58-year sentence on the New Jersey weapons charges, there was no need to proceed with that case.

> The Black Lives Matter website itself says that one of its goals is to disrupt the nuclear family

As it says:

> We disrupt nuclear family ... by supporting each other as extended family.

Nuclear family has been around since about 1300 among western europeans, while extended family has been practiced among other europeans but also other groups across the world and is quite common to this day for a reason.

> A nuclear family with a father in the home makes a boatload of difference.

An extended family makes even more, as parents can rely on them for help especially when it comes to children, and in society as ours where people are struggling to raise their families, have less and less kids, etc.

> Prior to the mid-1960s, nearly all children were born to married couples, including black children. This phenomenon was reversed once the progressive War on Poverty began. The welfare state incentivized single motherhood as it provided mothers with welfare benefits if there was no man in the house.

There's another thing which happened back then, which is the end of segregation, replacement of black business by corporations, which until then catered to their communities, but also liberalism, sexual liberation, attacks on marriage, etc.

> More evidence that blm’s main goal is not helping blacks, but overthrowing the US for a communist society is the fact that they have continuously defaced statues important to American history.

Yep, when Europe became Christian and Christians did the very same at much larger scale, the goal was clearly to turn Europe into a communist country before communism even existed.

> One of the main goals found in the Communist Manifesto is the destruction of ... national identity in order to make way for a communist society. This seems to be what blm is attempting.

That's precisely what liberalism and capitalism are doing and have been for decades, to generate more profit.

> While America fought communism abroad, they sought to destabilize the U.S. from within.

I like this tbh, not only does it get so much of it wrong, but it tops it off with narrative that props up American imperialism, which really says everything about it and whom it benefits.

That's kinda one of issues with OP, the entire meme of ""communism"" merely reinforces the very cause of blm, and ignores that blm represents left-wing of capital. But ""conservative"" capitalists who have vested interest in the system need to prevent genuine opposition to it, so they look at Jeff Bezos and others expressing support and donating to blm and go ""Those darn commies infiltrating these wonderful corporations.""

Further, communists at least see the issue with the system and attack both capitalism and liberalism, while capitalists not only can't see the cause but actively advocate for a toxic system that's been ruining the west (and I don't mean in overall wealth or the amount of billionaires we have, but in general).

I looked through your profile, it's more than evident what you support. I didn't say I'm ""pro-communism,"" maybe improve your reading comprehension before criticizing anyone. I noted that they are preferable and more of an ally than capitalists could ever be.

> Right wing is capitalism you brain dead moron.

There's nothing right-wing about capitalism and liberalism, that's ahistorical, rot is literally the opposite of right-wing. The idea that only form of ""right-wing"" must be ""conservation"" of a liberal, capitalistic system is certainly idiotic."

Yeah, literally name me a government that loves people trying to overthrow it.

When I see him in *Shutter Island*, I don't think of him as the racist slave owner from *Jango Unchained* or Jack from *Titanic*. I see him as the FBI agent that he plays in that particular movie.

Hell, I'll half-agree with you that the racial angle is overplayed. Some police will treat most everybody like shit, doesn't matter what color they are or even how much money they have.

""What is a terrorist organization, exactly? Lets first take a moment to clearly define what I'm claiming BLM to be. The word ""terrorist"" gets thrown around much too loosely and I don't mean this to be some arbitrary thoughtless alt-right platitude.

In one sense, a terrorist organization is whoever the state decides is a terrorist organization. Its whoever the state implicates to be intolerable, with whom negotiation is off the table and are thus subject to extreme prejudice. And this could be a legitimate effort (like in the case of ISIS) or purely cynical and politically motivated. There's definitely reason to be extremely cautious when labeling a group to be ""terrorists"", especially when this designation is applied one's own citizens. But terrorism does exist. It is effective, difficult to contain, and doesn't always take the form of mass shootings or planes crashing into buildings. In the most unbiased sense, a terrorist organization is one that uses extreme intimidation tactics (i.e. terror) to achieve a political end. Mass killings and televised executions are one form of very effective intimidation but it is not required that the tactics have murder as a focal point. Any threat of violence will suffice.

BLM uses violence and hard-line intimidation to achieve their goals. They burn down neighborhoods and intimidate residents into silence, they destroy businesses and kill business owners forcing others to put up signs pleading their solidarity in hopes of appeasement. They destroy public landmarks and tear down statues regardless of whether or not the statue depicts anyone with a connection to racism because America is racism and all monuments depicting its history must be eradicated. They will literally break into your property and threaten you and your family while filming the whole thing as you attempt to protect your home and your children from a violent mob. Why? So they can post it publicly and positioning you as the aggressor for others to see - the message being ""There is no where to hide, there is no dissent, we will come for you at anytime and if you defend yourself you will be met with even more onslaught \[from BLM and the police who's administrators would rather sacrifice a few innocent people than risk more violence from the mob\]"". It doesn't even help if you're the mayor of Seattle who supported their hostile occupation of public land.

And you might say that these incidents are the exception and most BLM activists are peaceful protestors practicing civil disobedience in the fight against racism. But I should remind you that it isn't about racism, its about anti-racism and, to them, America is racism (insofar as its a part of Western Civilization) and thus ""anti-racism"" = anti-America, anti-Western civilization, anti-whatever the fuck they decide should no longer exist.

BLM is an organization of uncompromising ideologues. They are an ignorant horde of convenient idiots and malicious despots that cannot be placated or reasoned with. They are neo-Marxist zealots who don't believe in the concept of fact and reject science as a matter of course because, to them, the only truth that exists is part and parcel with power dynamics rigidly enforced along racial lines. And this contagion is mounting an all-out political, cultural, and literal assault on the fundamental legal and moral infrastructure on which our civilization is founded.

If that's not a terrorist organization, I don't know what is.""

Let's add to that, most people who say shit like ""defund the police"" or ""ACAB"" would be the first ones to die if there were no actual cops and it was anarchy since they're all unphysically fit retards.

It doesn't even help if you're the mayor of Seattle who supported their hostile occupation of public land.

And this contagion is mounting an all-out political, cultural, and literal assault on the fundamental legal and moral infrastructure on which our civilization is founded.

IN CONCLUSION; I think all the peaceful protestors should distance themselves from BLM, as it is a shit organization that should be shut down. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkEGGLu\_fNU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkEGGLu_fNU) Here you can see Floyd's arrest video, which only got leaked about 2 days ago because it was still being investigated. If you look through it, you can see the media lied about many things and that their whole protest was bullshit, but that's the typical thing liberal SJWs do."""

Some worked out, some didn't and looked really out of place.They even managed to get random players nobody heard of interviews on TV shows like Jimmy Fallon and got celebrity appearances in-person. I think the only celebrity who has ever showed a *genuine* interest in OW that wasn't just a paid appearance or investing in a esports team was Zedd, but recently he's lost some interest according to his twitter. I see Luke Doncic apparently plays Overwatch, I wonder how well that translates over him to being a big fan of a particular OWL team."

Rather than wait for the inevitable, Eric makes it known that he’ll be taking pills to speed along the process and it’ll be happening at the end of the party. 

The party itself is sad but it’s also fun for guests. Part of the fun involved is a Polaroid being passed around and friends hamming it up for the camera with their host. 

Also during the party, they set up a shot of a make shift memorial/altar that Eric has set up in his home of friends and loved ones who already died from the disease. It’s a bunch of photos tacked to the wall.

> There is one neat effect when characters unwisely venture into a corridor and the door slams shut on them. Then a laser beam passes at head level, decapitating one. Another beam whizzes past at waist level, cutting the second in two while the others duck. A third laser pretends to be high but then switches to low, but the third character outsmarts it by jumping at the last minute. Then the fourth laser turns into a grid that dices its victim into pieces the size of a Big Mac. Since the grid is inescapable, what were the earlier lasers about?

6001,2020-12-30 11:21:41,kmuncr,"It always makes me a little sad that people didn’t like Superman Returns. It’s not the greatest movie or anything, but I always felt it captured the essence of a Silver Age Superman story, but done with a more modern twist. It’s not all about Superman going around punching stuff with huge explosions, it’s more about his humanity and his interactions with other people which is where I feel Superman really shines."
6002,2020-12-30 08:14:32,kmuncr,It is an entire Superman movie where Superman doesn't throw a single punch!!
6003,2020-12-30 18:59:48,kmuncr,I still think it was a good movie.
6004,2020-12-30 05:18:44,kmuncr,"I just watched Burnt a few weeks ago. I enjoyed it, it’s worth at least one watch, but it definitely relies heavily on Bradley Cooper’s performance."

6013,2020-12-30 06:17:40,kmuncr,I’m pretty sure that didn’t make the final cut.
6014,2020-12-30 16:07:27,kmuncr,That with the tie-in at the end of the movie where the kid stands up to Rhino is perfect.

6016,2020-12-30 07:10:53,kmuncr,"I tried watching that with my son a few weeks ago... So fucking boring. I mean in an R rated film about space demons - with some talented actors - they managed to make something so mundane and vanilla, I don't understand. 

I'll just think of Event Horizon as the unofficial Doom movie."
6017,2020-12-30 15:42:59,kmuncr,"Superman III was definitely not a great movie, but I did enjoy several scenes like the woman getting sucked into the computer. She looked truly terrified.

Pretty forgettable film, nowhere near as good as the first two but there’s a couple of shining moments"
6024,2020-12-30 15:41:13,kmuncr,"Yes! I don't despise the movie (not as much as many others, in any case), but I really love that ending, as he cautiously, unwillingly, creates the resistance."
6025,2020-12-31 09:26:52,kmuncr,"It makes me cry actually. Nick Stahl portrayed that helplessness in the control room, very nicely. The score that plays over the nuclear attack and John Connor's narration is great as well."
6026,2020-12-30 13:12:02,kmuncr,"There is another part where he acts like Tony Montana, then Quint from Jaws that always made me laugh."

6042,2020-12-30 09:24:51,kmuncr,"It could have been good with other actors, but above all a different script. Luc is not the genius he thinks he is. Their chemistry and arc was cringe."
6043,2020-12-30 19:56:25,kmuncr,"I can only partly agree with this.

Picard ramming the Enterprise as a desperate gambit was entertaining enough, but the Scimitar being a super-duper overpowered mary-sue ship made no sense given the context that it was made by slaves.  Slaves who we'd never seen before, and who themselves weren't romulans but some distant relative of bat boy.  Yet all 4'7"" of them were supposed to be intimidating shock troopers during the dominion war?

I have so many issues with that movie.

Usually I can put aside a plothole here or there, but there's so many fundamental problems at the core of that narrative that it's difficult to enjoy the spectacle without getting irate about how badly the story was mishandled."
6044,2020-12-30 15:44:25,kmuncr,"There's a scene in the third one (I think), where human soldiers take down Decepticons using cables, explosives and teamwork. It's pretty much jingoist propaganda, but it's also pretty damn cool."

GREAT fun flick."
6047,2020-12-30 05:33:04,kmuncr,I loved Mouse Trap! I refuse to accept any movie with Nathan Lane as terrible!
6048,2020-12-30 19:03:10,kmuncr,Thats a good movie tho
6049,2020-12-30 20:18:06,kmuncr,I defy you to name a *bad* scene in Mouse Hunt!
6050,2020-12-30 15:03:36,kmuncr,I love when Superman looked at the Flash and Flash started to shit bricks. It was the best part of that movie.
6051,2020-12-30 20:29:14,kmuncr,"Personally, that scene bugs me because it catastrophically undermines the whole point of having a Justice League and makes all the other characters look worse by comparison. Not only is he insanely strong, not only is he insanely fast, but he's faster than the Speed Guy and stronger than all the other Strong Guys combined. So instead of Superman being a critical symbol of hope, he'll make every issue trivial [because he's an invincible, immortal alien with unlimited power and if anything bad happens he'll just pick it up and throw it into the sun.](https://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2011/09/05/krypto-fascism)

On the flip side, I've got to agree with you that it's probably the most interesting and memorable part of what is otherwise a *very* bland movie."
6052,2020-12-30 14:07:04,kmuncr,The movie cost 300 million dollars due to reshoots. It ballooned the budget to astronomical amounts.
6053,2020-12-30 15:02:10,kmuncr,"well, that's one of the few scenes that was salvaged from snyder's original filmed material. so at least the snyder cut is going to look cool."
6054,2020-12-30 13:24:01,kmuncr,The part where they get the battleship Missouri ready was cool.
6055,2020-12-30 11:52:13,kmuncr,The anchor drop scene is also so cheese it’s fun
6056,2020-12-30 17:20:51,kmuncr,Terrible movie. I watch it every time I find it on TV.
6057,2020-12-30 17:21:25,kmuncr,thanks for finally giving me the title of this movie! I remember the premise from somewhere - probably a video library - but have never been able to find out the title.

6065,2020-12-31 09:31:09,kmuncr,"Honestly, the entire opening sequence was super cool. Until they decided to do a cheap and much, much boring reboot of Lost World.

Indoraptor had a cool design and a super scary theme. Too bad it got wasted in a bad script."

6069,2020-12-30 09:23:52,kmuncr,It is a bad movie so it qualifies... 😉
6070,2020-12-30 15:05:10,kmuncr,I think that 3/4 of the first Hobbit movie are really good. I love when Bilbo decides that he wants to go on his adventure. He gets that little gleam in his eye and the music swells.
6071,2020-12-30 22:07:34,kmuncr,"Anytime the Hobbit movies are focused on Bilbo and the scenes lifted directly from the book, it's pretty solid. It's all the added, unnecessary bullshit that drags the rest of it down."

This totally sums up the Ghost Ship opening."
6089,2020-12-30 05:19:01,kmuncr,"Horror movies in particular seem to be prone to this.

Another example; ""Darkness Falls."""
6090,2020-12-30 06:19:27,kmuncr,A lot of times those types of movies will spend a ton of cash on an awesome opening to get funding from a studio. Then they have to make another 70 minutes with only like twice the cash they used for those 5 minutes.
6091,2020-12-30 06:27:39,kmuncr,"Oh that is gold, thank you."
6092,2020-12-30 07:03:30,kmuncr,Maybe those lasers are expensive to run and they were trying to save on on electricity?  Maybe The Umbrella Corporation wants to go green?
6093,2020-12-30 14:10:25,kmuncr,"> Does the corridor have a sense of humor? 

I feel absolutely dirty over defending any aspect of the Resident Evil movies, but the lasers were almost certainly controlled by the Red Queen, who is a sadistic bitch. Not a great explanation because we never learn exactly why an AI enjoys human suffering so damn much, but at least it's there."
6094,2020-12-30 14:52:35,kmuncr,I was thinking the same while reading the scene description. The first set of lasers seem like a waste of time.
6095,2020-12-30 18:46:37,kmuncr,AI training itself perhaps?  Those might have been the first people it lasered and from now on it will always use a grid.
6096,2020-12-30 06:31:38,kmuncr,"Something I never understood about movie critics is why they have to critique movies like Resident Evil. Resident Evil was never trying to be anything but an over the top action/horror movie with zombies. They're bad but they're fun, at least in my opinion. It wasn't trying to win an Oscar or be involved in ""high society"" conversations. Why do films that are just made to be fun and a turn your brain off good time need to be critiqued by someone who the movies were clearly not made for? A film critic is not needed for movies like RE. 

Also, I'm not saying RE or any other similar movies don't deserve criticism. I would not understand why he needed to critique it, regardless of what he said about it. Leave these types of movies to the average Joe/Jane reviewer whom the movies were made for."

This results in him using his speed force to the max to try to alert past Batman of this impending horror!< which we see in the movie as a massively out-of-context Flash talking to Bruce, who woke up from a nap, through a time portal, babbling about ""Lois if the key"" and having gone too far."

6115,2020-12-30 13:14:53,kmuncr,"I don't really see how you drew a connection to the silver age. The silver age was corny, upbeat and fun. Superman Returns really takes itself too seriously and is such a needlessly mopey film and it feels like Bryan Singer (ugh) went in to making this with only half of Richard Donner's intentions. Donner gave the first Superman a sense of seriousness and weight whilst also managing to keep it mostly fun and entertaining. The only thing Superman Returns has in common with the silver age is how stupid it is."
6116,2020-12-30 14:14:37,kmuncr,"It's not a bad idea in theory. I believe that Superman is only ever interesting when he can't punch his way out of a particular problem. Arguably one of the best Superman stories of all time, All-Star Superman, has him overpowered to the point where he literally has no weaknesses or limits, and I can't recall him ever physically fighting anyone. The idea can - and has - been executed well many, many times. It's just that Returns in particular sucked at it."

6131,2020-12-30 16:05:14,kmuncr,I suppose that depends on your definition of a bad movie?
6132,2020-12-30 15:16:04,kmuncr,Yeah my kids love it too. They used to ask to watch it because they knew how much it irritated me.

Episode 1 is underwhelming but not really actively bad. Episode 2 though... some cool sequences in there but nothing can redeem it's long run time, terrible love story, and flat direction."

AotC is one of the most boring and uninteresting pieces of shit in movie history. Lifeless characters, inhumanely poor dialogue and the plot is about as exciting as doing fucking taxes. 


Fuck that fucking movie."

6138,2020-12-30 23:52:48,kmuncr,I think they just filmed Al Pacino’s reaction to the rest of the movie
6139,2020-12-30 16:52:32,kmuncr,Yeah I also liked the camping scenes. Felt really human and warm. Nothing like the recent Star Trek productions.

6141,2020-12-30 17:16:30,kmuncr,Cara and Dane just aren't good actors in my opinion.
6142,2020-12-30 19:58:04,kmuncr,Oh I agree the movie has mountains of issues that just start with the Remans. I still get goosebumps every time I see that scene though. It’s such a Kirk thing to do it always shocks me when you see Picard doing it.

For some reason his delivery of that super skeptical ""what?"" always slays me.  His delivery to pretty much everything in that movie theater scene is gold"
6154,2020-12-30 23:25:58,kmuncr,To critics but I don’t think it was bad at all. It just came out at the wrong time. It would be viewed as a masterpiece if it came out today.
6155,2020-12-30 18:16:52,kmuncr,I think the vast majority of the scenes about Bilbo are really good. It's all the extra stuff that bring the movies down.
6156,2020-12-30 05:42:44,kmuncr,I do.
6157,2020-12-30 12:48:48,kmuncr,Its been out for 4 days.

6165,2020-12-30 07:44:32,kmuncr,"> Why do films that are just made to be fun and a turn your brain off good time need to be critiqued by someone who the movies were clearly not made for?

So only a critic for whom a movie is clearly made is equipped to critique it?

If so, of what use would be the critique?"
6166,2020-12-30 09:11:32,kmuncr,"Personal opinions aside, there's still generally a clear line between a good ""dumb fun"" movie and a bad one. And truthfully, I find critics do respect that.


A good example is the Fast and Furious franchise- since the big ""turnaround"" after the fifth film, every movie in the franchise has been certified fresh on RT, with most being above 70%. I know, I know, RT scores aren't everything, but it does go to show that professional critics can still evaluate things outside of a ""high art"" lens. 


Other examples are stuff like the Marvel films and the John Wick franchise. Personal opinions will vary, but they're overall well-received by audiences and critics alike, and while a few such films are genuinely great imo, I think most will admit that they're movies that aren't aiming for academy awards.


There's still a difference between Fury Road and the Death Race remake, and that's why critics are still important even for popcorn flicks."
6167,2020-12-30 16:07:40,kmuncr,"The thing about Roger Ebert was that he tended to review movies at their level or as against or as examples of their genre. Like if you are trying to rate a new movie against the best and most influential super hero film, what does that make Hellboy (2004) or Sin City or Batman Forever? Where do they fall on the continuum? FYI - Hellboy 3 1/2 out of 4 stars, Sin City 4 out of 4, Batman Forever 2 1/2 out of 4. Seems fair.

If you actually read the reviews and not just look at the rating, they are very fair overall. I rarely disagreed with his ratings or reviews, and if I did I could honestly see what he was getting at based on the full write up. Sometimes he could be very wrong in hindsight, but I think he was always evolving and putting a lot of thought into what he said after watching a film.

Now, that doesn't mean all critics are like that, but I always view critics as a way to gauge what the film may be like, like a canary in a coal mine. Also, I only read or follow ones that I know I kind of agree with on certain things. If I know that so and so likes stuff like Mandy and Possessor, I know that they probably are on the same wavelength as me where it comes to movies. I will give their review of a new movie more weight than someone who I feel doesn't line up with my likes/dislikes."
6168,2020-12-30 17:01:57,kmuncr,Because they get views.  Many more people will read/watch a review about Resident Evil or the next MCU movie than they will about some art house indie movie that they don't recognize or have any intention of seeing.
6169,2020-12-30 14:04:10,kmuncr,He’s great in everything
6170,2020-12-30 17:18:00,kmuncr,Psst.  Schreiber was actually intimidating in his portrayal.  The other guy played Sabertooth like an insecure tough guy.
6171,2020-12-30 17:06:08,kmuncr,"Best part (and by best, I mean most impactful) is watching Superman murder a teenager (who is in his Shazam form and Supes actually stops him from turning back into Billy) by staring into his eyes with his heat vision."
6172,2020-12-30 17:50:02,kmuncr,"The phrase is usually used when a shitty movie references or flat out shows a better movie in their movie. Like the scene in Twister where they’re watching The Shining at the drive in theater. 

I like the idea of using it in this context tho, pretty clever"

6189,2020-12-30 18:01:47,kmuncr,"I am so happy that the Clone Wars series exists. They did the best they could to explain that little mystery within the canon they were given. The problem was, the Jedi look like idiots for trusting this random ass clone army. ""Who the fuck just rolls up with an entirely secret army?"" she states, purposefully forgetting the hodgepodge of bullshit that was Rise of Skywalker."
6190,2020-12-30 13:43:55,kmuncr,"It may not be a good movie, but the OST is awesome. I will forever defend this movie due to Across the Stars.

I do actually like the movie, even if I agree almost completely with your post."
6191,2020-12-30 16:31:41,kmuncr,"Attack of the Clones is not so bad, if you watch it with the point of view that Anakin was always meant to be a cringy teenage emo jedi and Padme is just as immature as he is. It explains all of their dialogue and the love story."
6192,2020-12-30 23:43:08,kmuncr,"Yes a new hope was the episode 2 of the original trilogy. Bad dialogue, was slow, boring, and Luke was whiny like father like son."
6193,2020-12-30 23:29:42,kmuncr,"It’s not perfect but it’s good. Did you see episode 4 it’s the episode 2 of the original trilogy. It’s kinda boring, slow, has poor dialogue as well and made the same mistakes."

6198,2020-12-30 14:52:42,kmuncr,"I can give you an educated guess as to why it looks so bad.

For the reshoots of Justice League, Joss Whedon rewrote 80 pages of script for the theatrical cut. Fabian Wagner, the DP, estimated that 90% of the total footage in the theatrical cut was a new reshoot or old footage that was edited in some way. Only 10% of what we've seen in the theatrical cut is untampered footage shot by Zack Snyder. Ray Fisher also recently confirmed all but *one* of his scenes in the theatrical cut was a reshoot.

You're probably getting the idea that this project is now an entirely different beast to what Snyder originally envisioned. As you can probably expect, everybody was in hyper-crunch mode to get this thing completed and released on schedule. Since they were pretty much shooting a whole new movie in a period of roughly five months, everything had to either be passed off on a bare minimum or just straight up rushed. Of course, the VFX work was one aspect where they could have used more time to finalize, time that the VFX team unfortunately didn't have. The result of the rushed madness is the terrible CGI villain and Superman's mustache-gate we know and abhor today.

Obviously this is not the fault of the VFX artists. They hardly had any time to render out and fully finish the VFX shots to its absolute best before release. Blame WB for attempting to course-correct and creating a corporate monstrosity of a movie that pleased absolutely no one."

6201,2020-12-30 18:20:00,kmuncr,It should've been two reasonably length movies. That's it. I know they wanted to include stuff from the Unfinished tales and such but there's not too much they could've done to add to the movies. Especially since they were not allowed to use anything from the Silmarillion.
6202,2020-12-30 06:08:15,kmuncr,Agree

6206,2020-12-30 23:13:58,kmuncr,The other guy was more realistic. Schreiber might be beloved here for his acting but he looked terrible. Sabertooth isn't for emoting.

6208,2020-12-31 11:27:47,kmuncr,The frame is so tight around the actors. It looks like it was cropped down. Surely it wasn't filmed that way.

6222,2020-12-30 17:04:28,kmuncr,"It's not even for the memes, Far From Home is so bland lol. I guess for me, Bad is more entertaining than bland.

Plus, it was kinda stupid that Peter says he's going to be his own person and not try to be the new Tony, only for him to use Tony's jet to create another Iron Man spider suit. While listening to Tony's music, and while Happy looks at him while thinking how much he reminds him of Tony.

And no, a great actor is not always the best fit. Tommy Lee Jones was not a good Two Face. Sometimes great actors shouldn't get their wishes."
6226,2020-12-31 01:07:30,kmuncr,Which is a shame because I think martin freeman was really good as Bilbo.

Schrieber have much more interesting character than the boring hunk that was Sabertooth previously.  That’s all  I care about."

What's stopping men from considering that their porn use might be unhealthy is the amount of chest bumping between males (and, let's face it, a lot of women) who claim it's ""normal"" and ""healthy"" to use porn. It takes a true man to remove himself from that widespread circle-jerkery (no pun intended)."

6285,2020-12-27 16:57:07,kkz007,This was exactly who I thought of.
6286,2020-12-27 16:16:03,kkz007,"I remember someone telling me this was how Heath Ledger died when I was 12.

They said that he believed he was Batman, tied a fork to the end of a rope, and fell to his death trying to use it like a grappling hook.

I never gave it a second thought until a couple of years later when I found out how he really passed away."
6287,2020-12-26 22:28:27,kkr9e6,"Yes, I really dislike it. We all can see that Terry is a good looking man, but the way Gina treats him is terrible. Terry is a good, kind and intelligent man who Gina treats like a piece of meat."
6288,2020-12-26 22:30:07,kkr9e6,"I completely agree. I dislike her character and rarely find her funny. Pretty sure no-one would find her behaviour acceptable or funny if the character were male and Terry were female, despite the fact it shouldn't matter the gender of either character."
6289,2020-12-26 22:50:57,kkr9e6,"Gina is a terrible person in many ways but she bounces off Holt in particular really well. She’s a good *character* in that she serves a needed narrative purpose a lot of times but she’s not a good *person* that you’d actually want to know IRL.

I don’t think we’re supposed to like her the same way we like the others."
6290,2020-12-26 22:29:42,kkr9e6,"Agreed. I always thought it was crossing the line, especially when there was that episode talking about how women face it everyday. Here we have every episode and Gina is doing it. Oh, but it's supposed to be charming *eye roll*"
6291,2020-12-26 22:36:41,kkr9e6,"It’s especially bothersome given the way they approach Wuntsch’s advances toward Holt, and the moment when Amy reveals her story about her superior who felt he was owed sex in exchange for her career. Maybe they don’t see the problem because Gina isn’t in a position of power over Terry? I still don’t like it."
6292,2020-12-26 22:33:08,kkr9e6,"I, like a lot of people on this sub, dislike a lot about Gina’s behavior. I wish the show treated her as the villain she clearly is"
6293,2020-12-27 02:09:42,kkr9e6,"Honestly Gina *is* a horrible person, but she's a narcissist to the point of absurdity: we're supposed to laugh at her and not with her. À la Jenna Maroney from 30 Rock. Not to undermine the seriousness of sexual harassment, but I think Gina just does it just to fuck with Terry because he's a straight-laced, married man who's pretty tightly wound. She's trying to push his buttons, because she's an asshole, and she thinks it's funny to bug him. You can think it's unfunny, or in bad taste, but she isn't a character we're supposed to relate to, look up to, or even like, in my opinion."
6294,2020-12-26 22:51:40,kkr9e6,Gina is the shows worst character by far. I’m glad she’s limited now.
6295,2020-12-26 23:28:30,kkr9e6,"YES. This is sexual harassment and makes me SO uncomfortable. If I was her coworker I'd file a complaint. If I was her boss, I'd fire her."
6296,2020-12-27 22:39:53,kkr9e6,I think you all need to get over yourselves. It's a fucking TV Show. Wise up and stop bitching
6297,2020-12-28 03:46:19,kkr9e6,"I'm a dude myself, and all I can say is that it's a damn TV show."
6298,2020-12-27 00:12:35,kkr9e6,I know B99 is set on a pedestal but it honestly has quite a few questionable moments. It ignores the men in favour of the women somewhat frequently.
6299,2020-12-27 05:32:39,kkr9e6,"Yes. Very much so. It's especially disgusting having learnt about the assault Terry Crews survived IRL. It can't have been easy for him to film. I would have liked it to be addressed. The show has been so topical, I feel like this is something that they could have done; address the double standard."
6300,2020-12-26 23:17:07,kkr9e6,I completely agree. She was a bully and a narcissist. Her parts I haven’t find funny even in the slightest bits and I’m glad she’s off the show.
6301,2020-12-27 15:07:13,kkr9e6,[deleted]
6302,2020-12-27 01:24:47,kkr9e6,"The show has a double standard about sexual harassment. Played for laughs with dudes, super cereal if its amy or rosa"
6303,2020-12-27 01:25:08,kkr9e6,Gina is pretty horrible to several people.  She's a jerk.  She can be funny at times on a TV show but would be intolerable in real life.
6304,2020-12-27 03:27:46,kkr9e6,Yea she’s what’s stopping me from rewatching any of the series. I really dislike her character.
6305,2020-12-27 16:41:34,kkr9e6,"Gina is downright unlikable in some episodes. When she briefly appears in the latest season after she's become famous, we hear about how she's been blowing off Jake's attempts to catch up with her, and then she continues to dodge them in person when she sees them again, and only reaches out to them because she needs their help.

Gina is really toxic, and if it weren't for her role as a comedic relief character most of the time I think more people would dislike her."
6306,2020-12-28 22:43:03,kkr9e6,I agree with the other parts but Gina was supposed to be a  narcissistic  bully
6307,2020-12-30 00:29:57,kkr9e6,"Of course not! Its Gina's straight up CHARACTER to flirt with who she pleases. ""Let's your legs fly"", as a wise Charles Boyle once said."
6308,2020-12-27 06:44:15,kkr9e6,"To even out the field cause people are afraid to post anything against this opinion and will get downvoted to oblivion,

I think that the things that she does aren’t far enough to be sexual harassment. The stuff that I remember on her making comments about his good looking body is not far enough. 

It’s harassment if they respectfully ask you to stop and you continually do it. We’re already dealing with enough emotional trauma about how men are never complimented in their life, or remember the couple times they were as a core memory"
6309,2020-12-27 03:22:26,kkr9e6,"yes. i never liked Gina or the way she treated anyone, including Terry, at all and i'm glad she's gone. it feels like a weight was lifted off of the show's shoulders, and the characters can express themselves more now that Gina isn't constantly berating them about being themselves"
6310,2020-12-27 04:44:40,kkr9e6,"I like Gina as a character but I definitely don’t like this aspect of her. If she ever comes back, I hope they either pretend she was never like that or develop on that and how she was wrong about it."
6311,2020-12-27 05:01:47,kkr9e6,"I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again! Gina is a trash character. 

Also, I see people taking this show too seriously at times. I know the show tries to tackle serious society issues, but to me they are some of the most cringe moments of the show. But that’s just me. And I don’t need to be validated by a comedy show"
6312,2020-12-27 05:26:21,kkr9e6,I mean they’re ALL pretty terrible when you stop and look at them. Not just Gina lol.
6313,2020-12-27 00:01:28,kkr9e6,I never took issue with it and still don’t. It added a great comedic dynamic to the show.
6314,2020-12-27 00:19:03,kkr9e6,"Gina wasn’t a funny character, a horrible bully, and the show is no worse for her absence."
6315,2020-12-27 05:16:22,kkr9e6,Gina is worse than Hitchcock and Scully
6316,2020-12-27 06:48:41,kkr9e6,"I mean the punch line of every office episode for the first 5 seasons was ""being gay is funny and a joke"" not super surprising they missed the mark on this too. Not to mention there's at least one time they laugh off police brutality/militant police culture generally."
6317,2020-12-27 07:14:16,kkr9e6,"It’s true, she’s an absolute monster start to finish."
6318,2020-12-27 02:22:11,kkr9e6,This show is fucking **rife**  with hypocrisy.
6319,2020-12-27 02:23:36,kkr9e6,Yes.  This has always bothered me.  It’s so wrong the way she acts.
6320,2020-12-27 21:52:04,kkr9e6,I completely agree ! This has always really bothered me every time I saw one of those scenes.
6321,2020-12-28 15:30:14,kkr9e6,I agree! Took me a few rewatches to actually realise she's sexually harrassing Terry. I thought it was just flirty banter and all in good fun at first but her asking for Terry's shower pics/how untethered he is from his wife etc just really made me really uncomfortable :/
6322,2020-12-29 00:43:09,kkr9e6,"I’ve only really noticed it on rewatching. I was quite neutral to her beforehand, she’s never been my favourite character but she has her moments, but yeah I don’t think it was right how they made her act towards Terry because she also seemed to have no consequences for her actions, she said something, Terry either didn’t seem to care or he cared for a few seconds and then the plot just moved on. I just wish there was even just a “Gina cool it” doesn’t even have to be made super obvious, just as long as it was there. I really notice the way she acts towards Terry now and yeah it ain’t right."
6323,2020-12-29 03:52:24,kkr9e6,"I'm in the middle of a rewatch right now and there's a lot more problematic stuff than I remember, most of it being from Gina. Sexual harassment/assault, bullying involving quite a bit of problematic material, actual literal domestic abuse that gets played for a laugh, using Asexual as an insult... theres a lot. 

Then there's all the stuff that has to do with blatant police misconduct played as being cool, their hatred of lawyers (ya know, part of what stops the police from just doing whatever the fuck they want to random people)

This show is sort of a hot mess, at least early on. I remember it getting better, but I'll have to wait and see during this rewatch.

Edit: not to mention how Wunch acts towards Holt sexually, and I know that she's the bad guy but its still a bit much since they also play that for laughs most of the time."
6324,2020-12-27 04:57:25,kkr9e6,Yes. Gina would be a great character if it wasn’t for that. Terry was not only being harassed but nobody did *anything* which was what makes me mad. The characters are nearly always present when she does this and they say and do nothing.
6325,2020-12-27 07:26:38,kkr9e6,"They talk about sexual harassment towards women and go on to sexually harass men??? Its kinda self defeating. If a sitcom is gonna talk about a problem they have to ACTUALLY talk about a problem and not just look at one side think ""ok now twitter people will like me"" and go back to normal. This goes for all showa its just that for some reason sitcoms have this issue the most"
6326,2020-12-27 05:56:49,kkr9e6,I think its funny and Terry has said in multiple interviews that the actor that plays gina is the funniest on cast
6327,2020-12-27 07:33:16,kkr9e6,"I think they should've just stayed away from those types of episodes if they were gonna make their characters so unlikeable put in real life situations
Like gina would be considered a horrible person irl but its a cartoonish show youre not supposed to think about that
Jake would be considered an annoying cunt irl (sometimes) but again its a tv show not real life
Just as a rule if cartoonish sitcoms like this sitcoms make political episode do them right
And make sure you characters dont themselves part of the problem"
6328,2020-12-27 04:38:56,kkr9e6,It’s part of her character to be not particularly good at keeping her attraction towards some men tucked away like she out loud calls nautia or Leo (genevieves brother) hot while only seeing her for I few minuites I like her character and I think it’s funny when she does this even when it’s just joking but it just depends on how Terry handles it
6329,2020-12-27 01:46:25,kkr9e6,I think we all hate it. Even the writers who concocted this bullshit storyline backed away from it
6330,2020-12-27 00:44:44,kkr9e6,"It's on purpose to show that men can be victims of sexual harassment too. Gina is a blunt person whose extremely sarcastic. Once you can see past all that she's not that bad, still not my favorite character but tolerable."
6331,2020-12-27 03:33:42,kkr9e6,"“Siri, what is comedy?”"
6332,2020-12-27 05:58:08,kkr9e6,Gina was unbearable after she got hit by the bus
6333,2020-12-27 01:43:21,kkr9e6,And IRL she tried to get Joey Diaz cancelled. Played herself on that one.
6334,2020-12-26 22:28:43,kkr9e6,Don’t go woke. It’s a show. It’s not real. It’s not like people live their lives based on what they saw on B99
6335,2020-12-27 03:25:16,kkr9e6,And a loyal husband and a loving father...
6336,2020-12-26 22:30:09,kkr9e6,"Exactly, like, God Terry is stunning but the way Gina acts and the fact it's not ever addressed is just gross."
6337,2020-12-27 06:24:16,kkr9e6,"Sadly it’s a classic case of reversed gender roles. If a guy were acting that way towards a girl character, he’d be condemned for being a perv and a pig generally. But since it’s a girl acting that way towards a guy, all of a sudden it’s funny!"
6338,2020-12-26 22:32:33,kkr9e6,"Another point I sorta brought up with the episode where it was focused all around that guy who broke his penis.

That whole scene with amy is so emotional and heartfelt and then you have Gina literally pointing to Terry's junk and saying ""that's a beautiful gift"""
6339,2020-12-27 03:38:01,kkr9e6,“Anyone else dislike the way Gina acts?” was enough for me
6340,2020-12-27 06:25:46,kkr9e6,Same! I remember thinking I hope she leaves eventually my first time watching. She’s just annoying.
6341,2020-12-27 04:21:41,kkr9e6,"I agree with you a lot, but:

>Pretty sure no-one would find her behaviour acceptable or funny if the character were male and Terry were female,

This is sadly not true. Women getting harassed and people willingly overlooking it is a real issue. It's pretty widespread, and pretty bad. People always act like everyone is shocked and full of empathy when hearing that a woman was harassed, but in reality, you will be met with tons of doubt and victim blaming. After all, you could be an evil wench trying to put an innocent man into jail with your false accusations.

For this reason, I kind of dislike that whole ""Well what if the genders were reversed"" narrative when it comes to harassment, and it would be very very nice of you to not use it in the future to prove a point on how bad harassment on men is.

I'm really with you on this, I hate how Gina treated Terry. Just please don't perpetuate the myth that women will always have their problems taken seriously. That actually makes it harder for us since everyone thinks ""Women always are believed, so someone has to play devils advocate.""."
6342,2020-12-27 15:34:08,kkr9e6,Is she not just reverse hitchcock tho? Hitchcock does the same shit to women and Amy especially. No one calls Hitchcock out.
6343,2020-12-27 01:35:24,kkr9e6,"YES. She's meant to be dispicable, sort of like characters in Seinfeld. You're not supposed to like her, you're supposed to laugh at her because she's an absolute caricature."
6344,2020-12-27 13:07:23,kkr9e6,"Yeah, I don't think the problem is with Gina the character, who has some great moments. I think the problem is that the writers have some weirdly strong blind spots which reveal themselves in uncanny ways through their characters.

Like how early on Rosa punches Hitchcock and he replies ""I know I deserved it, but why?"", which is a joke about being abused.

Or how they have (spoilers s7) >!Amy replace Jake's therapist with a paid actor to spy on him for the Heist!<, one of the most awful things a character does in the whole show.

Of how (spoilers s6 or s7?) >!Jake calls ICE on Nikolaj's father!<.

I could go on. I don't think there's a single character that is completely ""safe"".

It's not so much an indictment of the characters themselves, but rather some bizarrely egregious choices made by writers that appear completely tone deaf in the context of an otherwise very progressive show."
6345,2020-12-27 06:27:33,kkr9e6,"I’m in the middle of another rewatch, and I’ve paid particular attention to Gina as I was definitely on her “hate train” previously. I still don’t love her, but she does act better than most people give her credit for (this is excluding all of the Terry stuff, I’m just talking in general). Is she pompous, conceited, and annoying? Yep, but she actually does a lot to help out the squad - she’s just doing it while being herself, meaning that she’s annoying while doing it. And I really love that she comes to value Holt so highly. At the beginning of the show she complains about having to be his assistant, but ends up leaving the 99 to go with him in season 2 or 3 (I can’t remember which season it was when Wunch demotes him). It’s really sweet and endearing. 

All of that being said, her behavior towards Terry is absolutely unacceptable"
6346,2020-12-26 22:40:09,kkr9e6,"Well thats another point, the relationship between Wunch and Holt is actually better, I'm speaking as a gay guy myself but as much as they dislike each other I see the barbs and such as more of a professional sibling rivalry, plus I'm pretty sure Holt and Wunch would've been together if they hadn't made Holt gay, the chemistry between them before they were rivals was honestly great."
6347,2020-12-26 22:43:18,kkr9e6,"I've definitely seen this argument around too, about the power dynamic between them and I also still don't like it. I think it's a shit argument because all the power dynamic means is that a bad act is made worse if it also involves exploiting someone less powerful than yourself in the process. It's not like doing it to someone more powerful makes that person less of an asshole for behaving like that in the first place."
6348,2020-12-26 22:36:35,kkr9e6,"The only reason I posted this was because I've seen a lot of people loving Gina and I just wanna be like ""hey if we're gonna cancel a guy because of a slightly racist tweet from 10 years ago why don't we cancel her for committing multiple counts of workplace sexual harassment"""
6349,2020-12-27 05:53:16,kkr9e6,She'd fit in with the gang on IASIP.

6351,2020-12-27 22:42:00,kkr9e6,"Considering the amount of replies disagreeing with you I think you need to wise up and realize that normalizing male sexual harassment isn't good, even in a show.

Should I be able to show a graphic rape scene where the rapist is portrayed as the good guy because ""it's just a show""?"
6352,2020-12-28 03:47:55,kkr9e6,"A lot of these arguments seem to boil down to ""It's fictional so it's okay"" and honestly.. no?"
6353,2020-12-27 01:56:20,kkr9e6,"yeah you're getting thumbed down but honestly I think you're right, the show always does that

**Sexual Harassment -** Done for Comedic affect when its a male victim (Holt and Terry) Serious issue when its a female (Amy) even though what Wunch and Gina do to Holt and Terry is actually WORSE than what her former captain did (though I agree that guy was a dick)

**Halloween Heist** \- Fake Proposal to the woman is going too far, but a Fake therapist to a guy for months is a okay

**Disagreement on Kids** \- If the guy is uncertain hit him with an ultimatum and a divorce threat (because realism) but if the woman quits best to shower her with unconditional love and compassion (because fuck realism)"
6354,2020-12-27 21:57:25,kkr9e6,"Well the only manipulation I can recall is for the Halloween heist, if we're taking those episodes seriously, we can say holt broke into amy and Jake's apartment when he ate Jake's breakfast.

Not excusing it at all, but I'm just saying I think that was less serious."
6355,2020-12-30 00:39:56,kkr9e6,"There's a difference between flirting and asking someone ""how tethered to your wife are you"" and asking him to be a gogo dancer at your wedding and pointing to his junk and calling it a beautiful gift."
6356,2020-12-27 12:50:09,kkr9e6,"Terry is consistently shown to be uncomfortable with Gina's comments, and refers to harassment seminars/training in direct response to them on at least one occasion. What is far enough for you?"
6357,2020-12-27 06:52:18,kkr9e6,"I'd like to see some examples, I don't remember Holt being gay getting played for laughs, in fact the only comment was made by Gina herself and that was right after meeting him."
6358,2020-12-27 19:56:23,kkr9e6,"I genuinely can’t think of an episode of the Office where “being gay is funny and a joke” was a punchline. *Michael* thought it was funny, but he was always shown to be in the wrong."
6359,2020-12-29 03:59:11,kkr9e6,"I will say I think the hate towards lawyers is more played up because there is a certain dislike between the two groups, same with firefighters, but yeah I genuinely dislike Gina as a character and I think the show is better off without her"
6360,2020-12-27 00:46:31,kkr9e6,"Is it? Because its played for laughs and no one ever addresses it, if it was showing that men can be victims too they would have taken a more serious route like they did in the *whole episode about workplace sexual harassment*"
6361,2020-12-26 23:50:27,kkr9e6,"It's a show that actively tackles issues such as sexual harassment.  So it sort of looks like a double standard.  

Maybe you should learn to just expect more from your media."
6362,2020-12-26 22:36:26,kkr9e6,I've only seen up to the start of Season 6 and I don't recall this episode. Will watch out for it.
6363,2020-12-27 04:46:56,kkr9e6,"I think they meant ""no one would find it acceptable in a TV show"""
6364,2021-02-21 11:04:11,kkr9e6,"This is wrt to the target audience of a show like b99. I don't think they said that everyone will take women's issues seriously. We all know that's not true, all of history has shown us that. But shows and movies especially ones like b99 are dissected for feminist issues like sexism racism sexual harassment transphobia homophobia etc. Heck people are invested enough to make conspiracy theories and fanfiction and all. So the roles being reversed within the context of such a show, it's pretty obvious that Terry objectifying Gina and all would definetely be taken way more seriously than the current situation."
6365,2020-12-27 13:18:29,kkr9e6,"> For this reason, I kind of dislike that whole ""Well what if the genders were reversed"" narrative when it comes to harassment, and it would be very very nice of you to not use it in the future to prove a point on how bad harassment on men is.

You ""dislike it"" because you're a hardcore feminist and are trying really really hard to seem like you're reasonable but in reality you're not at all. 

You're downplaying the seriousness of mens issues.

Men objectively have a harder time coming forward with sexual harassment than women do. That is simple unarguable fact. 9/10 times when domestic violence involving a women abusing a man the man is the one who goes to jail. We literally just had the Johnny Depp and Amber Heard story as well. I could go on but the point should be made.
 
In todays political climate the comments Gina makes to Terry would get the show straight up cancelled if it was Terry or Jake making them to one of the female cast members. 

The show also deserves criticism for this because it's always heralded as doing really well with real issues but when it comes to male sexual harassment, especially with a person who actually was sexually harassed its the butt of a joke. 

I guarantee you'd be the first person cancelling the show on Twitter if the roles were reversed."
6366,2020-12-27 15:57:17,kkr9e6,"Yes and no.  Most of the characters are pretty openly contemptuous of Hitchcock, in large part because of things like this.  The squad still seems to love Gina, despite her frequent sexual harassment of Terry, constant putdowns of Amy, and generally being a self-centered jerk."
6367,2020-12-27 06:14:42,kkr9e6,"Accept she’s not, all the other characters like her, accept her, and never call her out on anything. In fact, they enjoy everything about her, value her opinion, and want her around as much as possible. If she’s supposed to be an asshole, they would treat her as such. She’s just a terrible character they thru in the show because they liked the actress, but never really got a fell for how to make her mesh."
6368,2020-12-27 21:23:59,kkr9e6,"Doug Judy harassing Rosa at every opportunity and it being played off as a joke because she could beat him up (which is exactly what happened when Terry Crews was assaulted irl)

Or Amy forcing Jake into having kids by essentially bullying him using a very public format she knows he’s terrible at (debate) instead of sitting down and working it out over a series of conversations like adults. She even gives him an ultimatum (do this thing or I’m leaving you), which can be a tactic of abuse. 

There’s so many examples of characters doing toxic shit that just never gets addressed again or shown to be bad. It just happens, is accepted, and then everything moves on. 

Which I get is a weakness of a short sitcom, but ugh."
6369,2020-12-27 06:49:45,kkr9e6,"I agree completely.

She steps up to help Jake with his eviction. 

She routinely helps Boyle out, even going so far as to force her mother to dump Lyn after finding out she was cheating and does it secretively because she wants to protect Boyle’s feelings.

She keeps Amy distracted with the toilet repair during Show Me Going after seeing that Amy definitely wasn’t coping.

She helps with Holt’s community outreach program with the teenagers after Amy and Rosa dismiss her out of hand. 

She correctly identifies the potential issues with the IT specialists when Terry is interviewing them"
6370,2020-12-26 23:58:35,kkr9e6,"Wunch and Holt would be gotten along fine if he hadn’t assumed she torpedoed his promotion years ago. I think it was just the case of Holt starting it, based on what he thought happened, and Wunch biting back because neither would take the morally higher road and try and mediate. But that’s the great thing about their relationship, it’s so petty and unbelievably childish, from two people such as Wunch and Holt, that it only makes it better. And then you have Holt realising >!how much he’s going to miss her at her funeral.!<"

Those office episodes were like 2008 and popular culture made that cringy by idk 2014? The b99 objectification episodes were made just a few years before popular culture truly recognized that things like female-male workplace sexual harassment/power dynamics in workplace are serious issues."
6380,2020-12-29 04:08:45,kkr9e6,"Yeah I think I just took this chance to air *all* of my grievances with this show so far in this thread, not just the Gina stuff since any other time I seem to get mobbed by people telling me to just quit being offended.

Honestly I might be taking stuff too seriously but after so long I had this image of a great perfect progressive show in my head so its really shocking seeing all this stuff on rewatch.

Personally hearing Gina use asexual as an insult really upset me because I've recently discovered that I'm asexual myself and I've been dealing with that a lot in my personal life, hearing a jab at that in a show I loved really hurt.

(I also realize they probably meant asexual as in literally, like mitosis or something but Asexuality as a sexuality has been around for way longer than the show has existed so they could have easily gotten it right)

6388,2020-12-27 16:37:57,kkr9e6,"Yeah Hitchcock's behavior is never really accepted by the other squad members and the joke is always on how gross he sounds saying it, not what he's saying.

I think this kind of reinforces in the audience's mind that that kind of behavior isn't okay. But this doesn't get done with Gina, if anything she's celebrated despite say pretty similar (if not worse) things to Terry."
6389,2020-12-27 08:36:27,kkr9e6,"Gina's supposed to be a ""Yaasss queeeeeen"" influencer-style sarcy millenial character (or more accurately, what people *think* influencers are all like), which is probably why she's so fucking annoying. 

She's obnoxious, conceited, sexist, and a bully. I think they wanted Gina to be a sarcastic and witty side-character and forgot the difference between dark humour and outright bullying. The writers seemed to forget the difference between occasional crappy behaviour that can be redeemed, and too many instances of Gina going out of her way to ruin someones day.

Some of the things that she says to Amy would be devastating to someone who was obviously picked-on and lonely during school years, but for some reason Amy cried over how much she would miss Gina. I'm actually pretty glad she's gone; she's not a bad/evil character that you can still love like Wunch or The Vulture, because the show tries to convince you that she's a good person at the end of it all.

[Even Kevin gets sucked in](https://i.redd.it/p2o8g85u9jf41.jpg).

6398,2020-12-27 06:52:45,kkr9e6,"trust me I get how u feel (that ep is a huge trigger for me) but if it helps u can use the ending to take the edge off some of the worst elements (u know for the sake of the pairing since its one of the only good ones)

the biggest issues I had were

* **Amy treated Jake like he was replaceable** (talked about starting over like it was nothing without reevaluating first, and didn't seem to be particularly phased in her scenes with Rosa, I know kids are a big deal but this should have been the emotional equivalent of picking between an arm and a leg) if roles were reversed and Jake found out his marriage might end I'd expect him to be shaken to his core, and Amy vs Kids to be the hardest most painful decision of his life no matter how badly he wanted them 
* **Amy Negotiated in bad faith but assumed the worst of Jake -** She used a formal debate knowing that Jake stood no chance, and yet when he asks to let it breathe thinks his request to press pause would mean years, when it likely would have been a couple months max based on his track record
* **Amy handwaved his needs then made a big stink about hers**  \- Downplayed and dismissed his concerns about being a bad father, told him he was on his own with his fears, then demanded he immediately commit to getting past 30 YEARS OF NEGLECT in a MONTH without offering him any kind of support, not to mention paying a fine to a judge who kicked him when he was down and thanking Rosa for her offer to bully him
* **Amy used underhanded tactics** \- worst one being when she bragged that unbeknown to Jake she walked out to leave him alone with Terry to be talked into it (seconds after putting the fear of divorce in his heart)

how the ending helps

* Amy looks like she's about to faint in relief when Jake agrees to have kids, and with the way she holds onto his arm in the last shot, I like to think that was her quietly saying he's irreplaceable to her and that she's not okay with being with someone else
* When Jake explains how he found the confidence to have kids using the bomb experience with Pam, Amy is overflowing with pride, like she's realizing that she underestimated him, and that Jake always finds a way to come through for her
* when Jake agrees, Amy gently asks if he's still scared, and when he asks if they can start later on, she more or less pounces on agreeing (almost like she realized this wasn't fair to him and regretted being so hard on him)
* Off screen she did book time off for them to take a trip together, despite believing it was her only card for some stupid reason, so maybe she was trying a more reasonable tactic

now of course this only works for Amy, If Jake had a medical condition (was at risk of losing the ability to have kids in 3 - 4 years time) and treated her like this, I'd still tear him to shreds

but u can still use this to feel better about it, especially given that Amy grew up as the only girl and youngest child among 7 boys, with parents who pitted them against each other, then entered a male dominated field, I mean that would mess someone up a bit"

6410,2020-12-27 05:01:54,kkr9e6,"I agree with most of this but the Amy stuff is funny most of the time e.g “That can’t be true, Amy doesn’t have a friend”"
6411,2020-12-27 18:25:55,kkr9e6,"problem is they're inconsistent with that

in Heist 5 the SHOWRUNNERS tell the AUDIENCE that if Jake fake proposes to Amy that's going too far (she would dump him over it)

in Heist 7 the SHOWRUNNERS tell the AUDIENCE that if Amy sets Jake up with a fake therapist and breaks his trust for months, that's fine

you say that everyone can do whatever they want, but the SHOWRUNNERS say different (AMY is allowed to do anything, JAKE still faces consequences if he goes too far)

that's what I'm getting at (if the showrunners said it was okay for both to act poorly, then that's fine, but they do not)"
6412,2020-12-27 07:42:30,kkr9e6,"Yeah and I think the actors having influence definitely contributes to that too, I don't think they're necessarily bad people so they hopefully were trying to do right by making those kind of episodes. I just think like basically everything, a lot of people got away with making jokes out of things that we now recognize as something that marginalizes/rooted in ignorance, and examples abound in the shur/goor universe especially anything before 2016ish"

6418,2020-12-27 00:53:05,kkr9e6,"Ah right, if anything that's more evidence to her being less memorable on top of everything."
6419,2020-12-27 05:37:44,kkr9e6,"I see her responses/attempted to joke at Amy's nerdiness as cheap schticks and low hanging fruits. In B99 where most of the jokes are pretty fresh and clever, her jokes tend to be the ones I've seen on other shows already.

Laughing at the nerdy kids may just be an American school cultural thing that I never understood, tho. Having said that, doesn't it just reflect how childish Gina is, being still stuck at high-school level jokes?"
6420,2020-12-27 18:49:41,kkr9e6,"I think you're overthinking this here: in heist 5 they have that dialogue to establish to the *audience* that it's a real proposal, and other than that specific moment anything goes for the heist, against basically everyone.  (The Fitbit/pen taser gifts are basically identical, and also a huge violation of trust.)

Gina is an issue problem because that's repeated, doesn't further the plot, and pretty directly undermines the message they're trying to promote in ""He Said, She Said"".  That seems pretty unambiguously bad to be and can't be read as an oversight in the way the proposal could."
6421,2021-02-23 01:07:27,kkr9e6,I Get it. you're right. Forcing her to be the gf was partially blackmail if I recall which I hope everyone took it the way it is. a fugitive perv being a perv
6422,2020-12-27 06:09:11,kkr9e6,The issue is whether ABC would let her. Depends on her contract.
6423,2020-12-27 19:07:39,kkr9e6,"I dunno if I'm on board with that (have to respectfully disagree)

the fact doesn't change that Amy said that if the proposal was part of the heist she would dump him (establishing that there are some things that are going too far even by heist standards, even if the intent was to show it was a real proposal, they already established that standard),

after establishing that they then went ahead and messed with his therapy 2 seasons later and handwaved it (which is much worse)

From my POV the only reason they deemed that acceptable was because it was a male victim, calling it an oversight it frankly being a little generous

I also disagree that the taser gifts are anywhere near as bad (though I honestly didn't like those either) reason is they didn't shock each other on any day besides Halloween, nobody was hurt on any other day

the therapy scam is different, Jake was sharing personal information with someone he thought was a doctor for SEVERAL MONTHS and trusting everything he was being told while Amy and Rosa listened in, so he was being actively hurt the entire time

and tbh I don't see the showrunners doing that with Amy, though for the record if Jake ever did I would have called him out myself"
6424,2020-12-27 06:11:49,kkr9e6,"Good point. Would also depend on shooting schedules. I know 99 has started shooting for season 8 this last week.

My running theory is that she faked her death do to some bad guy trying to kill her. And she's in hiding.
And said bad guy has tracked her down, and Holt has to help her catch bad guy, because despite their differences, he's the only one she trusts"
6425,2020-12-27 19:28:20,kkr9e6,"I also respect your POV here, though I disagree.  I'm not convinced that they would be unwilling to do the therapy thing in reverse.  I agree that the gifts were not on the same level as fake therapy (although I don't think they're harmful just on Halloween -- they affect trust on every day of the year), I'm just bringing it up as an example of something I see as serious where they clearly don't favor either sex."
6426,2020-12-27 19:31:45,kkr9e6,"I can respect that, I will admit that in the later Heist years I found myself not liking Heists very much because they go too far, (Holt and Amy in particular) so you could very well be right on that one in that it was an oversight 

but it always seemed like Jake got the worst of it whereas Amy.... not so much, and I guess it always sticks out to me when she goes too far because she was the one who called foul in Heist 5"

To clarify, I am not American and don't have any particular stance on BLM, though I am pro-equality. But it would be nice if BLM advocates didn't actively give credence to the arguments of their detractors so people who defend them in public discourse don't look like absolute mugs."

This is literally an adaptation of the adage ""Too much of a good thing"", which warns that something enjoyable or beneficial can, nevertheless, become bothersome or harmful in large quantities or over an extended period of time.

So him cautioning against BLM becoming racially supremist is him fearing the absolute worst and sharing that fear openly. It doesn't mean he believes it already is heading in that direction, but he does fear it could, because such a transition has happened to political and racial groups before, and BLM is both of those."
6475,2020-12-21 22:46:12,khoriq,"> One does not warn against something becoming racial supremacy unless they believe that it's heading in that direction.

Do you not consider that an overreaction?

Someone points out a potential risk and asks you to be wary, so you immediately jump to assuming they consider the thing they're warning you about to have already happened.

That seems like jumping to the most extreme reaction for the sake of casting everything in black and white, and anyone who doesn't follow the rhetoric of the group unquestionably as the enemy.

Also, people tend to issue warnings ahead of the subject the warning is about. Not after.

Edit: Oh and I think you're confused. I never said he didn't use the term ""black supremacy"" or condemn you for saying he did. I actually inferred that he did when I said 

> he said that people need to be careful that it doesn't

What I argued, and still do, is that unlike you I don't take that as an assertion on his part that the ongoing civil rights movement was already or was becoming a Black Supremacist movement.

And I disagree that the use of the term somehow validates your stance and invalidates mine."
6476,2020-12-22 00:28:22,khoriq,"So after reading the tweet that *you* posted, I can see that u/AsboZapruder is actually correct. He is warning against it, not saying that's what it is.

6487,2020-12-21 23:41:40,khoriq,">Do you not consider that an overreaction?

Considering that there are some (admittedly fringe) people outright advocating it, that some BLM/SJW folks consistently state that the ""right"" way to be an ally to PoC is to literally pay reparations out of your pocket to PoC, and other similar actions, I'd say it's not an overreaction. His is the only voice I've ever heard contradicting that wing of the BLM movement, meanwhile others actively give these extreme positions a platform and amplification. 

BLM has a good point, and in general I support the BLM movement- PoC of all races have been treated as lesser for too long, and functionally aren't living at a point of equity in this country right now. But to ignore the more radical wing and not shut down the voices that denigrate white people and who act entitled to their being and property- that where a slippery slope begins. It is not helpful to the movement and pushes in a direction that could be accurately described as ""Black Supremacy""."

These are antithetical. If decide to put into only ""your"" community, then you're pushing the other groups out because they aren't part of ""your"" group.

6495,2020-12-22 01:47:53,khoriq,I'm not arguing that it can't mean that. He's the one saying you would not warn someone about something unless you thought it was already happening. Which is obviously not even close to reality
6496,2020-12-22 06:45:42,khoriq,"And there's the rub. Few people actually take the time out of their day to take in the source material for themselves and instead rely solely on the interpretations of others, which is how Mr. Crews ended up in this mess."
6497,2020-12-22 18:48:16,khoriq,"Its not that what he said was outright racist or even ill intentioned that gets criticism, its that what he said was pointless and distracting because its openly and inadvertently repeating racist talking points. 

Like say on a scale of 1 to 10 where 5 is equality in policing black people are at 2. What good does Terry Crews do coming in talking about how we should make sure black people don't overshoot to 7. All the while the largest cable news network in America says theyre at a 6 already. 

So its not a false statement but is seen as openly unhelpful even if he didn't mean anything bad about it. Similar to how LeBrons china statement was on its own fine, its understandable players didn't want to be thrown into this while in china by someone in the US, but his expression of that used language that was basically Chinese talking points so his statement was actually pretty fucked up. 

That plus Crews' other fuck ups like after Gabriel Union left Americas Got Talent and told her stories of sexist/racist treatment behind the scenes Crews volunteered on a morning show how he didn't see anything and felt the show was actually very diverse because there were black contestants when Unions complaints were about the behind the scenes stuff.  

Or Crews posting a bunch of pictures celebrating China while NBA/BLizzard/Hong Kong Protest/Camps stuff was very big in the news. 

Crews is still seen as a positive nice guy but given his repeated actions is also seen as the kind of guy willing to go to bat for the establishment at the drop of a hat. Which is disappointing considering he received a lot of public support when he revealed his own sexual assault and how nothing came of it because of that person's power in the establishment so people though he should be more supportive of others. So people make jokes about him."

I guarantee that at this very moment, someone who goes to an LDS church is harassing someone online somewhere.

Also, I would definitely disagree with your assertion that the Proud Boys and BLM are or do exactly the same things.

Black Lives Matter is a decentralized movement focused on police brutality and all racially motivated violence against black people, though they also discuss and address other issues related to racism and racial inequality.  They are also explicitly non-violent, and what leadership exists has repeatedly condemned acts of violence committed by people affiliated with (or claiming affiliation with) the group.  In short, they are a non-violent movement that  advocates for social change in pursuit of equality.

Meanwhile the Proud Boys is a far-right neo-fascist group that explicitly holds views exalting ""Western Male Chauvinism"".  While they claim they are not white supremacist or racist, and do count since minorities among their membership and even their leadership, the venn diagram between the Proud Boys and explicit white supremacists/racists is *very nearly* a circle of you're looking at the kinds of things they believe and their membership. (And of course, last month Kyle Chapman attempted to take over the group and announced it would openly be a white supremacist organization, though it doesn't appear the coup was successful).

The Proud Boys also lionize violence against the political left, to the point where their founder Gavin Mcinnes, [said](https://www.vox.com/2018/10/15/17978358/proud-boys-trump-biden-debate-violence), ""I want violence, I want punching in the face. I'm disappointed in Trump supporters for not punching enough."". And getting in fights with left wing activists is a primary means of advancing in the organization.

So those BLM and the Proud Boys are definitely not the same."

I remember discussing/learning about this in an intro to terrorism class years ago, although of course at the time so much of it was framed within violent Islamist extremism. In discussing what leads to terrorism,  a perceived lack of valid political outlet or means to successfully address grievances at hand was one of the conditions. I don’t think you listed your causes in any sort of order but if one were to try, I believe this cause that I’ve suggested would go before and lead to siege mentality. It’s hard sometimes but I believe humans will generally try to address grievances the right way first, that is using existing political outlets however formal or informal they may be. But when that fails, and the moral fanaticism and cognitive dissonance exist, is when a person becomes vulnerable to siege mentality and suddenly feels like the world is against their righteous cause."

While I do agree that any ideology can be taken to extremes I don't believe that currently the average right-wing/conservative person endorses their side's extremist.  Ask the average conservative about extremists and they'll condemn them immediately or tell you how counting that particular group as right-wing is misleading.  The latter being a common talking point as Islamic extremism is often counted under the broad umbrella of right-wing extremism in order to conflate violence with conservative politics.  As for the Proud Boys specifically, what little I've heard about them indicates they're not extremists.  They don't discriminate based on skin color or sexuality, they don't want to deport or kill legal citizens for the sake of ethnic purity, and they don't advocate violence.  In fact the only violence I've seen associated with the Proud Boys has been when antifa counter protesters initiated it.  I don't like the idea of condemning strangers because some random person online told me they're extremists, especially when the most vocal opposition to those strangers is a group that shattered the windows and painted swastikas on the walls of a jewish bookstore.

Conversely, polls show that the average left-wing/liberal person believes that BLM is a peaceful organization.  They'll tell you that the violent riots are either an outlier caused by opportunists, or a conservative conspiracy that involves sending people undercover to cause riots that can be blamed on the left.  I've had liberals here, on CMV, tell me that the opinions of experts don't matter if it disagrees with what they believe."

In my post I said that any ideology could be taken to the extreme under the premise of moral fanaticism, For example, if someone who claims to fight for freedom and equality will begin to attack anyone who didn't vote for his favorite presidential candidate, That person in my opinion would be a violent radical fanatic.

If I burn a flag for the imaginary country in my head, nobody cares, and it's not unethical (just a waste of time). If I burn a swastika, most people would agree that this essentially an ethical act, since nazi Germany was an abhorrent country and destroying their flag demonstrates my opposition to their terrible ideology. But symbols are dependent on context. If I burn a cross, I might be expressing my disapproval of the Christian church, but I could also be a KKK member at a lynching. 

So burning (American) flags by BLM and the Proud boys cannot be removed from context. If the USA can be subject to criticism (which, unless your a fanatic for the USA, you must accept) then burning an American flag can be ethical, or at least motivated by a legitimate ethical impulse, if it coincides with a legitimate criticism of the country. However, in my view (and many other people here), BLM has a legitimate criticism of the USA, and the proud boys do not. So the groups do not make the same mistake when they burn the flags."

Violence is also used by the state to enforce its laws. It always sounds either disingenuous or ignorant to me when someone says ""violence is never the answer"" or ""we should condemn all violence"" when all of western civilization is built on the foundation of police violence being used to keep society from collapsing into chaos. You can't call all violence bad and then turn around and thank the police for stopping a rape or a murder.

It's a slippery slope to claim that all violence is the same. Is killing a shooter to stop them as bad as them shooting people? Is invading Nazi Germany as bad as the concentration camps?

Wait, you agree that burning flags isn't really different than offensive speech, but you think that is why flag-burning is wrong? Do you have a right not to be offended? We can't live in a country where people are not allowed to offend each other - everyone has to be able to defend their ideals, and sometimes that means confronting speech that makes them uncomfortable. Patriot's can express their (quite reasonable) hurt feelings when someone burns a flag, but that doesn't mean that burning flags is automatically immoral.

\>someone with this type of mindset will probably try to rationalize what he is doing, something like ""it is fine when I do it""

Something like flag burning is always contextual - there cannot be a universal moral imperative against flag burning, because flags are the symbols of countries, which are fallible, and everyone has the right to criticize their country. But, if your criticism of the country is garbage (like the Proud Boys) then your flag burning is morally wrong because your doing it to support white supremacy. When your criticism is valid, then it is possible that your flag burning is morally justified if the moral cause of your critique is greater than the hurt feelings of people who put meaning into the flag. So when BLM think ""It's fine when I do it"", well, they are basically correct. BLM burning a flag is far more morally defensible than Proud Boys burning a flag, because a symbol cannot be removed from it's context."

And the tears in his eyes were played for comic effect because the broader joke is that Homer is the dumb, bumbling father that Lisa has to introduce her boyfriend to, and he is going to make a series of comic errors to mess it up. Homer burning the flag was a message that couldn't be removed from it's context (eg. it being an accident).

And people who feel strong, passionate feelings about their countries flags do not just ""live in the country"", but have bought into a narrative about their country being fundamentally good and meaningful in some way. I live in Canada, and people here do not have nearly as strong as feelings about their national flag, because (in general) while most Canadians think their country is good, and want to work to improve it, many of us don't think Canada is uniquely good in a way other nations are not.

6620,2020-12-18 21:37:24,kf1d9b,"Well you just assume that I don't know anything about the subject and that getting downvoted has any meaning whatsoever.      
Sex addiction was invinted by a psychologist who got caught cheating by his wife. So he made up this addiction. Here in Europe our psychologist societies saw through the bullshit and it is not a valid diagnosis because the illness simply does not exist. Just because you have a sex drive and even a high one is not an illness. People are different and some people have a very high sex drive that doesn't make them addicted in any way. How many people have lost their jobs because because they couldn't do anything else but f\*\*k? A real addict could not do anything else. Yes there are people for example with an alcohol addiction that can still manage to have a normal life but where are all these so called sex addicts that can not do that anymore? There are none! What is the remedy? What is the ""right amount"" of horniness? Who decides that? The person with the low sex drive?      
There is nobody, absolutely nobody who can not think of anything else than sex. But real addicts can't focus on anything else until they have satisfied their addiction. With whom would they satisfy this addiction? It's not like you can find sex partners everywhere on the streets.      
It's just a made up excuse for people who cheated or who have a high sex drive.      
Porn addiction is the same thing. It has to do with your sex drive.      
  
To the ""food addiction"": That is not an illness either, it is a symptom. Psychologists in the US often turn symptoms into an illness (mostly for money reasons because they can charge more for new stuff).      
When you eat something your body releases endorphines. It's a small reward for giving your body what he needs. The problem with this is that it is a mechanism from the ancient times that ""never assumed"" that it would be possible to have almost unlimited supplies of food. So these days this mechanism can be abused. People who do this actually suffer from a depression and in order to feel better they abuse the endorphine reward system of their body. As the endorphine reward is short they need to eat very often. Real anti-depressants work with a constant level so that you don't have this up and down all the time. So again food addiction is not a real diagnosis it is just a symptom of a depression.      
  


I know my little explanation won't persuade you of anything. This is just a really short summary of what psychologists outside of the US and especially in Europe have concluded. I think the one thing that helped perpetuate this myth of the sex addiction is also the prudish protestant culture in the US that thinks that there must be something wrong with people that have a high sex drive and they must be taken down to a so called ""normal"" level."

Due to its systemic nature, it is easy to fall prey to the trappings of it because it affected our viewpoint of men from birth to now and continues to despite many being self-aware about the issue. Your anecdotal experiences with people being called “fucking losers” or “gay” should certainly not be used as some sort of definitive evidence of anything; believe it or not, different individuals will react differently, sometimes hypocritically, to situations. It seems like you are trying to simultaneously say the issue exists, but also doesn’t exist because the people who acknowledge the issue are always hypocritical about it. Despite that assertion being broad and incorrect, by its own logic it does nothing to refute the underlying issue and instead is tangential.

What does your incorrect judgment on the behavior of everyone who identifies as a feminist have to do with the concept being real or not? Are you trying to just establish ethos and ignore any substance to the argument or definition?

Any gendered version of a job that is available to people outside of that gender is inaccurate.

The Parvati one doesn't shock me too much. Controversial opinion: Parvati didn't seem to have a very strong/memorable presence on the show until HvV, but since then has been an undeniable powerhouse."
